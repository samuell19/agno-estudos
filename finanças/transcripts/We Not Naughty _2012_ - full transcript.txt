It's my birthday today. Here's my treat for you. It's my birthday tomorrow. Here's my treat for you. We just want to bully you. I didn't go to your school today, but your teacher called and said you rejected the cakes which your classmates treated you to and even dirtied their clothes when you threw the cakes back at them. That's not what happened. They threw the cakes on my face. I didn't retaliate. Are you saying your teacher lied? She didn't lie. She was taken in by them. It's so obvious that you're lying, and you're a terrible liar. How dare you cook up a story to deceive me. I'm not lying. It's the truth. You'd better own up or I'll punish you. If you can come clean with me, I'll spare you. Pass me the cane. Pass it to me, come on. Pass me the cane now. Are you going to own up? Tell me. Are you going to own up? Tell me. Okay, I did throw the cakes on their faces. Why? That's because I don't like them. Stretch out your hand. You said you wouldn't hit me if I owned up. - How dare you talk back? - Don't hit me. - How dare you talk back? - No, please. - You're so naughty. - That's enough. You promised you wouldn't hit him and yet, you did after he confessed. You accused him of lying, but you lied too. I'm educating the kid. Can you not confuse him? I'm confusing him? You're the one causing the confusion. Let me tell you. Not every lie is bad and lying isn't necessarily wrong. In this society, kids must learn to think smart and lie when they have to. Ask yourself. Just ask yourself. How many times do you lie in a day? When did I lie? Don't malign me. You didn't? According to experts an average person lies more than twenty times a day. Just think about it and stop screaming your head off. You're the one who's lying. Oh dear, that must be the salesman. Bao, stop crying. Go and tell the salesman that your mum isn't at home. So I'm supposed to lie to him? Yes. Go lie to him. Get going. - Hello. - My mum says she's not at home. Your mother says she's not in? Tell your mother I'm from Delphin. Last week, she made an appointment with us at the shopping mall. So I'm here today to demonstrate the functions of our vacuum cleaner. - Yes, I remember. - Hello. - I was given a stainless steel pan. - Yes. - Please come in. - Okay. This Delphin device is made in Germany. It can purify the air and penetrate the layers in a mattress to remove dust, fibre and dust mites thus creating a healthy and clean living environment. Here, check out the amount of airborne dust. That's a lot. Do you think this device can suck up the virus that makes people quarrel so that my family can live together harmoniously? Come on. Change into your uniform. It's time for you to wake up too. Must I wake you up every day? You're going to be late. But I guess that's all right for your kind of school. What happened to your hand? - I just beat up someone. - So early in the morning? I was looking for him for a long time. He didn't pay off his debt and even tried to hide. Actually, your mother is rich. Ask her to repay your debt so that you don't have to be a runner for the loan sharks. I'm an orphan. I don't have a mother like her. I won't turn to her for help no matter how miserable I am. Have you done your homework? Can I copy it? Homework? Why bother to do homework in this crappy school? We're just here so that we can delay our enlistment. The bus is here. How could you do that? Couldn't you tell that my wife is pregnant? How would we know? We aren't the father anyway. - Hey, you. - Forget it. I'm all right anyway. I'm really all right. Give me a smile. Twinkle, twinkle, hug, hug me I don't mind if you sleep with me I want you to make me high Get me crazy in the sky You wrote the lyrics? They said you did it so naturally. - I couldn't tell. - Of course. I'm the expert. But it was all just for fun. She looks really slutty. - Give me that. - Let me see that. Can you share with us what it's like to sleep with a teacher? I think... sheesh, I can't speak good Mandarin. I'm keeping that to myself. Your singing really, really sucks. My grandmother sings better than you. You look so ugly. You look like William Hung. In school, I used to be an expert in designing and making remote control systems. I also represented the school in creative competitions and won some awards. Good. The kids in our school are all rebellious teenagers. Once you find a way to communicate with them and gain their trust you'll be able to win them over. The moment I stepped into this classroom and saw all your youthful faces I was reminded of myself as a student back in those days. All of you exude an air of creativity that fills the entire classroom. Hello, I'm here to study, not to see a monkey perform. Can you stop being so pretentious? Okay, never mind. Okay, I just want to ask you why you think you're here. Why? That's because you're the best. By the way, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is CK and... I'm married. You can call me Mr Liew. Let me write down my name. Where's the pen? Okay. An expert is around. That's why machines can never triumph over man. There's definitely the wow factor. But I've already figured this out in Primary One. This isn't a good invention that will benefit society. It's just a tool for pranksters. So it's worthless. The two guys who pushed you at the bus stop today are students in my class. I thought this would only happen in movies. If only these were the odds in lottery. Wouldn't you be in for a hard time then? Not if I can speak their language. Don't they speak English or Mandarin? Yes, but teenagers have a different lingo now. I'll need time to grasp it. You'll need time to grasp their lingo? Does it mean you'll spend a lot of time on them? What about our baby? Will you have time for us? Of course. Our baby will be my top priority. I've got a fear of pain. Yes, my wife really has a fear of pain. I think we'll choose the painless method. No worries, we can do it for you. You can have a painless delivery. Thank you. The police are a bunch of idiots. All of them should just quit. Come in. - Boss. - Boss. - Boss. - Boss. Why are you so happy? Nothing. We just pulled a few pranks on the police. You pulled a few pranks on the police? Is this your way of getting back at your mother? Your mother neglected you, so you indulged in internet gambling and ended up debt-ridden. You should count yourself lucky that you're good at splashing paint. You managed to pay off two-fifth of your fifty-thousand-dollar debt and helped me meet my KPI targets. Boss, what's KPI? It's a measure of your work performance. My teachers in school are behaving pretentiously because of KPIs. But KPIs are good in a way. Thanks to KPIs, I know that you're performing well while the rest of you are useless bums. Good grief. Here's a reward from the big boss. Thanks. You'll even get a fair and tender Hainanese chick from Geylang. This is authentic Hainanese chicken from Geylang. Come on, tuck in. Come on, let's tuck in. Are you guys very disappointed? What were you guys thinking? You're such sex maniacs. Fine, I'll take you to Geylang later, okay? Come and have your breakfast. Mum, I'm having menstrual cramps. I don't want to go to school. Go take a painkiller and inform your teacher. Mum, I'm having menstrual cramps too, so I can't go to school. You're so naughty. You're lying again. Only girls have menstruation. Really? Is it different now? What do you mean? This has always been a fact. But Girl, didn't you already have your menstruation last week? Why are you having your period again so soon? She's lying and putting on an act. She doesn't dare to go to school now. Do you know everyone in Singapore is lambasting and mocking her for being cloyingly pretentious, shameless and a downright disgrace? Her videos have gone viral on the internet. Hundreds of thousands of people are talking about her. That's enough. Just mind your own business and have your breakfast. Girl, don't be afraid. I'll go with you to see your principal tomorrow and get him to issue a warning to those who are mocking you. He has to protect his top student. Top student? That's no big deal. Top students are a dime a dozen now. You've no right to criticise her. Look at the kind of school you're in and the kind of school she's in. She studies in her room after school every day while you're always not at home. So just zip it. Are you jealous of me? You're now in the worst polytechnic in Singapore. You'd better do something for yourself before criticising me. You... I don't need your stupid comments, okay? You shut up, okay? Why did you hit your sister? She's not my sister. Shit. Girl, you shouldn't have talked to your elder brother that way. Why are you so hot-tempered? Mum, you scolded Brother that way too. He's my son. I had every right to do that. Why are you always the one with such privilege? Another word from you and I'll beat you to a pulp. Have your breakfast. What's the matter? Was there an uprising? You were quarrelling so early in the morning. What's wrong with Weijie? It's all your fault that your son is incorrigible. Are you on the morning shift today? No, I'm going to the casino. Casino? Someone's giving me a treat. After being a taxi driver for so many years I've no idea what a casino looks like though I've been driving passengers there every day. Do you remember Ong Lui? He had a windfall at the casino yesterday. Now, he doesn't even want to go home. He says he wants to win every cent from the casino before calling it a day. He just called and told us to help him carry his winnings back. You're really going there? He's helping us pay the entrance fee of one hundred dollars. I'd be dumb to reject him. It's best to stay away from gambling. Heed the minister's advice. As long as you don't gamble, you'll always be the winner. The minister told you that? He was probably too embarrassed to tell you how much you could win from the casino. Really? Do you have the capital to gamble? No, I'm just going there to look around. Snap out of it. As the saying goes those who visit a casino will end up with nothing. Good grief, stop cursing me. You're so vicious. Like I told you, I'm just going there to take a look. Dad, I want to go too. Bring me along. It's a place for adults, not kids. Why? That's because... Gambling is meant for adults only. Why isn't it meant for kids? That's because gambling is a vice. It isn't right to gamble. So kids aren't allowed to go to the casino. If gambling is really a vice, why is there a casino? And why is Dad going there? Keep quiet and have your breakfast. Stop asking questions. I told you I'm just going there to take a look. It's called field research, okay? Can you bring me along for the field research too? You really know how to talk back. Why do you keep rebutting me? You have no respect for me. Are you mad? Why are you beating him so early in the morning? Stop pointing fingers. Can't you see he's getting from bad to worse? You'd better rein your son in. - Discipline your son. - He's your son too. National Creative Invention Competition. Based on the results of the poll last year, we... almost won. So this year, I want all of you to form an International Technological Polytechnic ace team. I want everyone to know that we have talents in our polytechnic. All right, everyone. This is the moment for you to present to me your inventions, ideas and business plans. If it's a good idea, I'll adopt it and you'll form an ace team to take part in the National Creative Invention Competition. All right? Come on, let's start. Come on. Let's give it up for our polytechnic. Yeah. What we want to invent is a remote-controlled dustbin. You won't have to walk to the dustbin to throw your trash. With the remote control functions, the dustbin will come to you. This is a very practical idea. We're lazy by nature. Sometimes, we don't mean to litter, but when we've got trash to throw the bloody dustbin is so far away. So with this remote-controlled dustbin we can work towards building a green city. Yes, it's amazing. This is a humanistic design concept centred around our practical needs. If we could get the right investors, this remote-controlled dustbin would become the next big thing with huge market potential. I even think this will revolutionise the design of dustbins. In future, when we think of dustbins, we'll think of you. Your names will be synonymous with dustbins. You will become the dustbin. Yeah. - Okay, next. - You've become dustbins. - Yeah. Come on. - He's so irritating. Yeah, come on. Next. Come on. Weijie and I would like to invent a small remote-controlled device. It can take on any disguise and fly towards the person you detest. That person will touch the device out of curiosity. We'll then crank up the voltage. And he'll get an electric shock. There will be great demand for this device because there's always someone whom we dislike and whom we can't deal with. Let me give an example. Teachers. The teachers might just beat you at your own game. Okay. I think their invention is attractive in a way and may even have commercial value but I won't support this idea. Why? That's because they started on a negative footing and in terms of creativity, it's a little passe. - And perhaps it's a little bit... - Lousy? - Let's just call a spade a spade. - No. - We get your drift. - That's not what I meant. I didn't mean to say that it's lousy. Mr Liew, since the first day you taught us I've felt that you're biased against the whole class. - I'm not. - We're lousy. That's why we're here. I know you've a beef with me, right? Let's settle this once and for all. Let's fight one-on-one right here. - One-on-one? - Well? - One-on-one. - Are you game enough? - One-on-one. - You're mistaken. - One-on-one. - Basketball court? - One-on-one. - Car park? Okay? - One-on-one. - You don't have the guts? - One-on-one. - You're mistaken. One-on-one. I know you like to invent things but please keep your spare parts properly. Our home isn't your dumping ground. What a naughty kid. Your dad is still not back yet. He's another naughty one. Mum, your eldest son and good boy is back. - Hello, good morning. - Dad. Check out what I bought for all of you. Here's your favourite mobile phone and here's your present. And here's the watch you've been asking for. Look at the time. What kind of good boy comes back so late? Late? Not at all. It's only six in the morning. Stop nagging. This is for you. Here, two hundred dollars for groceries. I'm very happy. I won six thousand dollars yesterday. I'm not a greedy man. I just hope to win five hundred dollars a day and I can quit my job as a taxi driver. Why did you come back with these when you were just there to take a look? Sheesh. You have no idea. I did so well for a beginner that it was unbelievable. Whatever I betted on, they became winning numbers and I managed to avoid the losing numbers. If you were there, you would've wanted to try your luck too. We don't care for all these. Your mum said you don't want your presents. - We do. - We do. Did you hear that? Are you asking to get thrashed? Why are you supporting him when he just went gambling? You've been nothing but a nag throughout our years of marriage. Whether I win or lose money, you'll just chew me out. I don't understand what you want. You're absurd. You won't always be so lucky. I'm warning you. You won't hear the last of it from me if you gamble again. It's not fair. It's not true at all. They can't do this. What happened to her? Look, it's news about Kim. Somebody's attacking her on Facebook. Look, this guy called David said he's had sex with Kim since she was fourteen. Shit. Is this true? It should be since so many people are talking about it. Poor thing. I know how she feels. I should go talk to her. Can you stop working when we're having our meal? My name is CK. I'm the teacher who took over your class. Yes. Actually, Mr Sng, I made this call to find out more about a student. His name is Damian Liu Jianren. Jianren? He and Weijie belong to the same gang. They're very problematic. Just leave them alone. Well, I saw the report you wrote about him. You gave him an A grade for conduct. Why is that so? If I gave him a D grade, I would've had to handle lots of paperwork send him for counselling and meet his parents. My projects were piling up and I had classes every day. So I just gave him an A grade for my own peace of mind. Students like getting the A grade anyway. Mr Sng, I still think that I should counsel them. Let me tell you. They're not going to listen to you. Even their parents don't bother about them. Don't shoot yourself in the foot. All right then. Thank you. - Dear. - Who's this? - Dear. - You guys must watch your back. The gang at Redhill isn't happy that we took over their turf. I've already told them that we divide the turf based on the People Action Party's electoral boundaries. We're just following the boundaries drawn by the PAP. Damn. I don't understand why they're so upset. Hello? Okay. Lim and Teck saw the Redhill gang leader in Geylang. Damn. He'll get it from us. But be careful. There are three guys with him, okay? Okay, let's go. Boss, he's my teacher. Your teacher? He didn't dare to have a one-on-one fight with me when I challenged him. One-on-one? Look at how effeminate he is. I doubt he has the guts. Hello? Let's go. Hurry. Why did your students criticise you for being a gutless coward on Facebook? They wanted to challenge me to a one-on-one duel. - Was it the guy who just left? - And two other guys. Why are they so nasty? They aren't nasty; they're just feeling inferior. They want to win the duel to prove they aren't weak. They don't want to be despised. Are you going to notify the school or the police? I know what to do. Your classmate, Kim, committed suicide last night. Luckily, the tentage below her flat saved her life. We all know that some people have been posting nasty remarks about her on the internet. I believe you would've known that she had been very unhappy. The police are investigating the case right now. Good morning, everybody. After much consideration I've decided to take up your challenge. But I'm not going to get into a fight with you. Let's have a drone competition. It's so unfair. You're the teacher. You'll definitely win. No. Look at me. I've never fought with anyone. If I agree to the one-on-one duel, I'll definitely lose. But if you have no guts to accept my challenge that means you're also afraid you'll lose. In fact, you're petrified. But what if you lose? If I lose, I'll treat everyone to a sumptuous meal out of my own pocket. Mr Liew, let's raise the stakes. If you lose, you'll put on a bikini... Bikini? and run one lap around the school compound. No. What bikini? I dare you to run one lap around the school compound in your birthday suit. Run in your birthday suit. Run in your birthday suit. Boo, Mr Liew. Go, Weijie, go. Boo, Mr Liew. - Go, Weijie, go. - Boo, Mr Liew. - Go, Weijie, go. - Boo, Mr Liew. Ready, in position. And go. Boo, Mr Liew. Yeah! Yeah! We won! Run in your birthday suit. - Shit. - Run in your birthday suit. Run in your birthday suit. Police. Is your mother in? Mum, the police are looking for you. What happened to my husband? Police. Freeze. Is this your name? You're under arrest. What's happening? Take away the computer. Follow me back to the police station. Girl. You were spreading vicious rumours about Kim online. Why? Don't waste my time. Why did you only catch me? Why didn't you catch her? - She hurt me too. - Answer my question. Is it because I didn't jump off a building and create a hoo-ha? I should've done that, right? She jumped off the building to kill herself. It's not my fault. Don't you feel guilty? Why should I feel guilty? I really don't understand why she jumped off a building. I mean, to attack someone on the internet you just have to type and then you send and then you just have to close your computer and ignore it. Nobody takes it seriously. Why did she take it so hard? This is just the internet. It's mainly for fun. Fun? You almost killed her. Okay, but even if she dies, people will just talk about her for one day, two days or even three days and then people will just forget about it. And life goes on. Once you know the rules of the internet it's really nothing. Okay, what are the rules? Accepting a challenge to be nasty. Accepting a challenge to be cheap. Accepting a challenge to be vicious. Those without the guts should just scram. That's all. Madam, do you know who your daughter has been hanging out with lately? She didn't hang out with anyone. She stays in her room after school. Her life revolves around the school and her room. Madam, that's the scary part. During our generation, kids went astray outside. Now, they go astray even in their own rooms. No matter how naughty your elder brother was he was never brought to the police station. Look at what you've done. Your classmate committed suicide because of you. Are you happy now? I'm really disappointed with you. Why couldn't I pay them back in their own coin? It's not fair. You should've just ignored them and focused on your studies. Talk is cheap. Walk a mile in my shoes and you'll know how upset I felt. You don't understand me. I hate you. Mr CK Liew, don't you have the guts to strip and run one lap around here? I expected that because you're a coward. CK, you made an empty promise. An untrustworthy man like you isn't fit to be our teacher. I'll tell you frankly. All of us despise you. - Boo! - Boo! - Loser. - You're useless. Are you really going to run in your birthday suit? Are you? Can you just remove your shoes and socks? Dear, since I took up the challenge I'll have to play by the rules. Now that I've lost, I have to keep my promise. I hope you can support me. It would've been acceptable if he had worn swimming trunks. I'm already very open-minded, but this is out of line. I can't imagine they're teaching our children. This is horrifying. He did nothing wrong. It was just for fun. At least he kept his promise. What's the big deal about running around naked? Don't you also strip naked before you take a shower? How could a teacher behave this way? I can accept foreign teachers, but they must be good teachers. How could a teacher do this? He should be punished. - Mr Liew. - Mr Liew. Mr Liew. We love you, Mr Liew. We love you, Mr Liew. Under immense pressure the teacher who ran naked in school has officially resigned this morning. However, many students and executives went online to garner support for this teacher who kept his promise. They hope that the school won't... With teachers like that it's no wonder the children are naughty. Mum. You're back. I've prepared lunch. Take a shower after your meal and then head for tuition. After you're back from tuition class, finish all these assessment papers. I'm off for a job interview. Mum, if I can finish all these assessment papers am I a good kid? Yes. But your dad is getting from bad to worse. I don't know what to do with him. Tuck in. Be a good boy. Yes! What's the matter? Am I a ghost? Dad, you freaked me out. Where's your mum? She went for a job interview. Dad, what are you looking for? Is that lunch? Dad, that's my lunch. Can you even finish everything? - Hello? - Bao. Is there an envelope on the table? Yes, there is. Put it away for me. Tuck it under my pillow. There's two hundred dollars inside and I need the money for groceries. Remember to put the envelope in a safe place, okay? Money for groceries? Yes. Is your dad back? Is Dad back? He's not back. Did he call? Did he call? No, he didn't. Okay. Go and do your homework. I'll be back later to test your spelling. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Dad, that's for buying groceries. I know. I'm just checking to make sure there's two hundred dollars. Do you know whose money this is? It's Mum's. No, it's mine. Have you forgotten that I gave your mum some of my winnings and spent the rest on gifts for you and your siblings? - Do you remember that? - Yes. You gave Mum the money. Come here. Let me tell you. I'll take this sum of money away and come back with more money again so that I can buy more mobile phones and watches for all of you. - Do you remember the gift you got? - Yes. Do you want a better life for all of us? Yes. Good. You have to help me then. Now, I'll take the money away. - What do you call that? - It's called... stealing. It's not stealing. I'm going to use this sum of money to make more money so that I can take care of our family. This isn't stealing. You can accuse me of stealing if I take the money away without letting you know. But you've seen what I did. So what do you call this? It's called... taking the money. Taking? No. When you take something, you don't have to return it. That's considered stealing too and it's what naughty kids do. If it's not taking or stealing, what do you call it then? It's called borrowing. Borrowing is different. When you borrow something, you must return it. That's the proper etiquette. So now, do you understand the difference between stealing, taking and borrowing? You must master your Chinese. Don't get bullied, okay? So you'll help me, right? Dad, are you borrowing this sum of money now? You're smart. I'll borrow one hundred and fifty dollars. I'll put fifty dollars back. Remember, don't let your mum know about this. Keep your lips sealed. Before twelve midnight, I'll put one hundred and fifty dollars back and no one will ever know, okay? - Dad. - What is it again? Am I a good boy if I do this? Of course. You're helping your mum, the whole family and me. Of course you're a good boy, okay? I'm leaving now. I'll be back soon. Bao, wake up. Let's go to the market. Boss, how much is the fish today? Five dollars per kilogramme. I'm getting these. Madam, this is a counterfeit note. How is it possible? I've only printed three. Why did you print only three? My dad borrowed one hundred and fifty dollars from Mum. Borrow? He stole the money. No, he borrowed it. That was what Dad said. Dad said he would come back with more money. But he didn't and he has disappeared too. I'm sorry, Mum. Dad said I would be a good boy if I could help him out. Okay, a kid like him couldn't have understood the implications but as parents, you have to bear some responsibility. Please come down to the station with your husband tomorrow. Sorry. Have some water. My friend saw the news about your case on Starhub Cable TV yesterday. Yesterday? How do we watch it today then? With Starhub Catch-Up TV, you can watch it again. Experience the rejuvenation of cells, feel the vitality and youth again just like a twenty-five-year-old. Welcome back to Dawn's Moment. The recent case about a teacher who ran naked in school has sparked off a flurry of responses from all walks of life. We have three guests with us today who will share their thoughts on the matter. Regardless of the reason behind it running naked in school is morally wrong. We shouldn't magnify the negative aspects and ignore the positive ones. As a parent, I was quite concerned at first. But after I understood the big picture I thought to myself that punishment, though necessary could take the form of a warning instead. After all, he's a good teacher. CK, you did nothing wrong. We support you. - It was just for fun. - He's a man who keeps his promise. - He's awesome. - It was no big deal. I feel there's something wrong somewhere. Ministry of Education? Can the school not sack him? Sack the principal. Thank you for keeping the promise. Someone should give him a Best Teacher Award. The teacher ran naked to honour a promise to his students. In this society where people make empty promises every day such conduct was fair and just. If we punish him for keeping his word aren't we confusing what's right and what's wrong? Aren't we sending the wrong message? We appreciate the analysis from the Member of Parliament, Madam Tan. Now, let's look at the poll results. Those who agree that the teacher shouldn't be sacked... Agree: 88.8% Disagree: 11.2% make up a whopping 88.8% This is great. It's almost unanimous. I'd also like to appeal to the authorities not to sack this good teacher whom the students respect. Please allow him to continue teaching. Okay, that's all for today. See you next time. Zell-V is just like my son. I probably spend more time on it than on my own sons. We've been operating in Singapore for more than ten years. Ensuring health, vitality and beauty is the only reason for the evergreen appeal of our health product in Singapore. It also rejuvenates damaged and ageing cells. It's a form of cellular therapy. It promotes cellular growth and strengthens immunity. You'll feel and look younger like a twenty-five-year-old. Well said, everyone. But this sales pitch won't appeal to customers. Please continue to brainstorm on the advantages of our product. Today, I want all of you to come up with new marketing tactics to help customers understand why our product can make them look and feel youthful again. Boss, that good-looking teacher is here to see you. - He's waiting at the reception area. - Yes. Goodness me, Mr Liew. Goodness me, Mr Liew. I actually didn't know you're my son's teacher. Come on, let's take a photo. Thank you for speaking up for me in your programme. You deserve that. No one could've helped you if this had happened in the past. But times have changed. The younger generation has a more unconventional mindset. It's good that you're back in school. But isn't Mr Sng the form teacher? He has retired. I took over the class from him. So I'm here to find out more about Jianren and his family. I understand. We're just a simple family. I'm a single mother with two sons, a dog, a maid and three cars. I'm also a TV presenter and motivator. I'm running my own business and... Actually, Madam Phua, I want to ask how you take care of the brothers. Hey, my dear son, you're back. - Hey, Mum. - How's your tuition? - Great. - Okay, here. Come, tell your brother's teacher how I take care of you. Hi, I'm... Hi. Well, whatever I want, my mum will get it for me because my academic results are excellent. I won numerous awards and I'm a perfectionist in every single way unlike my inferior brother. He's horrible. - He's in the worst polytechnic... - No. Son, don't say that about your brother. Don't say that. Sorry, Mr Liew. Pardon his ignorance. Actually, I'm very proud of this son. He tops his class every year. I don't have to worry about him. Jianren is slightly weaker academically. But each of them has his own strengths and weaknesses. I love both of them. You know I'm a busy woman. - Madam Phua. - But I love both of them. - Actually, do you know... - Boss, there's a call for you. Okay. Please excuse me. Hello? Yes. Okay. So you're my brother's teacher? Yes, I am. Okay, well, tell me. How do you teach such horrible students? I mean, they're hopeless. - Hopeless? - Sorry, excuse me. You can't say that your brother is hopeless. My apologies. I... Don't say that about your brother. - Boss. - Actually, Madam Phua - I want to talk to you... - It's time for your meeting. - Oh dear, I forgot about it again. - You're going to be late. Actually, can you tell me more about Jianren? Remember to drink the chicken soup, okay? - Does Brother have a share? - I want to ask you more about... Does Brother have a share? No. It's only for you, darling. - I love you. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm so proud of you. - Madam Phua. - I love you. - Madam Phua, actual... Actually, your brother isn't horrible and he's not bad at all. No way. Hey, Nicole. We've got something to show you. No. What? Bitch, our friend committed suicide because of you. Are you happy now? No. - Sorry. - You hypocrite. - I'm sorry. - You... No, stop it. Stop. Stop it. Please don't do that. I'm sorry. I'll let you have a taste of your own medicine. - I'm sorry. - Cut it off. Cut everything. Cut more. Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm sorry. So you think it's fun to bully other people? I'm sorry. Make it shorter. It's so funny. Oh my God, you look like a freak. Let's go. There are some wounds on your daughter's scalp. We have to shave her hair to dress the wounds. Here, sit down. Shave her hair off? Yes. Let me do it. Can you manage? I've done it before. Girl. Let's start afresh. Mum. I love you. I'm sorry. I love you, Mum. I love you. I love you. I love you. Mum, I love you. Mum, I love you. Mum, I love you. Mum, I love you. I love you. Mum, I love you. I love you. Sister, you're still very pretty. We just arrested the girls who bullied her. She has to assist in the identification process. Nicole, do you understand now? If you create hate, you have to pay the price, okay? Let's go. You had the cheek to come back? - Do you have any money? - Do you know Nicole was beaten up? Nicole was beaten up? So was I. Do you know that they'll kill me if I don't pay up by tomorrow? Do you want the whole family to get killed too, you heartless chap? What you did was atrocious. Get out of my sight. Listen to me. I remember you have some money stashed under your pillow. - I don't. - Lend it to me first. - Give it to me. - I don't have any money. Leave. Dad. No, Dad. - What are you doing? - You... No, please. What were you trying to do to me? You have no respect for me. What were you trying to do? All of you can't wait to see me die. Stop it. Bitch, how dare you hit me. How dare you. I didn't do that on purpose. I didn't do that on purpose. - Mum. - Mum. - Call for the ambulance. - Mum. Mum. Please don't die. Mum, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have printed the money for you to take to the market. I shouldn't have lied to you about having menstruation. Mum, please wake up. Mum, can you wake up, please? I'm sorry. We've already issued a warrant for your father's arrest. As soon as we have any news, we'll keep you informed. There's no need for that. To me, he's dead. I don't have such a father. Can I leave now? According to the doctor, Mum is already in a coma. So what's the point of crying? Brother, will Mum die? - I don't want Mum to die. - Brother, what should we do? Brother, will Mum wake up? How would I know? I hope she wakes up soon. But I usually have milk and sausages in the morning. There was nothing left at home except for these three eggs. Do you want it? But the egg is badly burnt. How am I supposed to eat this? So you don't want it, right? I'll eat it then. What about you? Do you want the burnt egg? Yes, I do. You don't want this either, right? Fine, I'll drink it. Brother, what if the loan sharks come looking for us later? What do you mean? There's nothing left at home. What can they do to us? Brother, what time will you be coming home? I'm not coming back again. We can share it. Your father beat up your mother? Damn, that was inhumane. I feel like beating him up too. When my mum was around things seemed to get done automatically. Now that she's gone, I feel really lost. Sorry. Your drone was very creative. Well done. I'm officially inviting both of you to join the ace team and represent the school in the competition. Okay? Competition? That's for you and the principal to achieve your KPI targets. It's none of our business. Okay, but that's not the point. The point is that I think both of you are really talented. Look, you could design and create the device on your own and even beat me. - That was no mean feat. Why don't... - Let's go. Okay. Just give me one minute. One minute, okay? This is a very important competition for both of you. It's a perfect platform to showcase your talents. If there's anything I can do to help, don't keep mum. Don't keep mum? Don't keep mum? His mum's in the hospital now. Yet you told him not to keep mum? Really? What happened? What happened? Brother. Brother. It's delicious. It's delicious. Let's visit Mum after the meal, okay? Brother, I have a feeling Mum's awake and waiting for us. - Mum. Please wake up, Mum. - Mum. Please wake up, Mum. - Mum. - Mum. Who are you? We're called loan sharks. Your father owes us money. We're here to collect our money. Don't assume we wouldn't come after you just because you're hiding in the hospital. Even if you hide in the Istana, we'll hunt you down. - It's my dad who owes you money. - Not my mum. And definitely not us. There's nothing left at home. There's nothing left except the three of us. So what do you want? Your father owes us thirty thousand dollars. It's normal for children to repay their parents' debts. That's the good thing about having children. You can repay your father's debt by helping us splash paint. You just have to splash and run. No talking is needed. It's a no-brainer job and you'll even get a good exercise. I promised my mum to be a good boy. I won't be one if I splash paint. Little boy, by splashing paint for us you're helping your father and your family. Are you crazy? He's only eight. What's there to fear? Look, even the PAP and the opposition are having younger faces. An eight-year-old boy like him will grow up to take on the world. Yes, you're right. Such a young loan shark won't be caned if he gets caught. The police will be so frustrated. Get going. Splash paint on those three units for me. Here, take this. Get going. Stop looking. Move it. Have you become a runner for loan sharks? How did you know? I heard about it from my gang. Stop doing this. Why did you cut yourself a deal which I can't wait to get out of? I didn't have a choice. Do you have any relatives? Seek their help. Yes, but most of them are in Malaysia. The ones in Singapore are worse off than us. - What about your neighbours? - Neighbours? Ask every neighbour to help out by lending you a little money. They'll be doing themselves a favour too. You know, the lack of neighbourliness is exactly why loan sharks have been targeting their debtors' neighbours resulting in lose-lose outcomes. Do you know the neighbours in HDB flats are very different now? Really? (Korean) English? (Korean) (French) English? (French) (Bangladesh) English? (Bangladesh) No. What about your old neighbours? They've either relocated or migrated. We're the only ones left. How about this? This is the last resort. I'll ask my boss to repay the debt for you and you'll help him splash paint in return. You want me to join your gang as a runner? At least we'll belong to the same gang. I'm more experienced. I can watch over you. Okay, he has a workshop at Toa Payoh Lorong 5. Let's go meet him. How could you ask Weijie to join your gang? Jianren, it was wrong of you to join a street gang to begin with and now, you're even dragging Weijie into it. That's way out of line. Are you really serious about helping us? Yes, I'm sincere about helping you. No matter what the problem is, I'll help you resolve it. Okay. Both of us owe loan sharks sixty thousand dollars. Help us repay the debts. Okay. Aside from repaying the debts, how else can I help you? My mum is hospitalised. Can you wake her up from her coma? The police can't find my dad. Can you help the police nab him? And can you help me take care of my siblings who are on their own? I can link you up with the social services department. Are you trying to get us arrested? Why can't you turn a blind eye like the other teachers do? You'll have an easier time. We won't blame you for that. And your KPI won't be affected. Are you done? Listen. If you really join the gang, you'll be doomed. I can't let this happen to the two of you. Stop following us. Dear, how much are our savings? Why are you asking? That's for the baby. I was just thinking that a hundred thousand dollars could ensure a comfortable childbirth when the baby is due. We don't have so much money. We have about... sixty-three thousand dollars. Sixty-three thousand dollars? That's enough. I'll just have to save them one at a time. - Who are you saving? - The bus is here. Listen. Hey, you. Please go back first, Dear. I need to settle something first. I'll be back in a while. I won't take long, okay? Where are you going? You ended up in this state all because of your father. You have every reason to hold a grudge against him, okay? I've settled his debt with the other loan sharks. You owe me money now, so you have to work for me, okay? Okay. This money is for you. Thank you, Boss. You've been slacking off lately. You haven't met your KPI targets. Okay, here, go splash paint on a few more units. Don't worry. It's easy. I'll teach you. There are so many colours? Green is for the first warning. Yellow is for the second warning. Red is for the third warning. And black is for the final warning. What if the debtors still don't pay up? It'll be escalated to the advanced level then. What's the advanced level? Arson. Don't worry. We're only in charge of splashing paint. Don't worry. I've got your back. Let's go. I've finally found you. My goodness, Mr Liew. What do you want? Are you a part-time private investigator? Look, this is a cheque for sixty thousand dollars. Pass it to your boss. I'll be frank with you. Sixty-three thousand dollars is all I have in my bank account. I'm withdrawing sixty thousand dollars to help you not because of my KPI. I just can't turn a blind eye and let you guys go down the path of no return. Take it. We had already reached the point of no return on the day we entered this polytechnic. Everyone condemns us. Do you think it's my fault that I ended up like this? Do you think I wanted this? You can choose to put an end to it. Do you know that when you really make a huge mistake one day no one will bother to find out why? A mistake is a mistake and you'll be punished. You can blame society. But will the society help you serve your jail term? You can blame it on your environment. But again, will that help you avoid your jail term? Fine. Even if it's your parents' fault for not giving you the proper upbringing can they take your place in jail when you're punished for your mistake? But you have a choice now. Take full responsibility for your future. We're hopeless. We're just losers. We aren't worth your time. You have a bright future ahead of you. You're married and you'll be having a baby soon. So stop wasting your time on us. Please leave. I'm not leaving. I'm going to make you understand that it's not too late to turn back. We don't have a future. Look at my family now. It's in a mess. Can you even call it a family? But I've resigned myself to my fate because this is my lot in life. We're bad and naughty boys. We're rotten kids. Even if we aren't caught today, we'll be jailed eventually. There's no turning back for us. So stop wasting your time. Just leave. I'm not leaving. You won't leave? Then we will. Look at it from another perspective. If I'd gone directly to the police the whole issue would've been resolved. But both of you would've been imprisoned and caned. I've been trying my best to help as much as I can. But if you choose to give up on yourselves today no one will be able to help you then. Jianren, are you giving up on yourself? Weijie, are you going to give up so easily? Let's go. Stop right there. What? Are you helping the loan sharks? So? I didn't believe my friends when they told me. But you've been coming home late recently. So I hired a private investigator. Look at this. Yes, I'm a runner for the loan sharks. I help them splash paint and harass debtors. So what? Why are you doing this? It's not right. I know. I'm a disgrace to you, right? The son of a famous TV presenter and businesswoman is actually a runner for the loan sharks. Once the media reports about this your reputation will be ruined, right? It's not my reputation that's at stake. What if the police arrest you? Don't worry. If I'm nabbed, I won't tell them about you. That's because you're not a mother to me. You're just concerned about your career and your younger son. Isn't that right? What's going on? Why am I involved? Can you stop talking with a fake accent? Do you think that makes you better than me? Dude, what are you talking about? I speak perfect English and you're deliberately trying to prevent me from what I'm doing. - What's up with that? - Amos. Keep quiet and go back to your room. Dude, what the freak is this, man? This is so unfair. You keep quiet, okay? Stop whining. - Stop going on about fairness. - Dude. We live in a democratic society and we have freedom of speech. Amos, just keep quiet. Dude, why do you keep asking me to keep quiet? Why don't you ask Damian to keep quiet? You obviously love him more than you love me. This is so unfair. Brother. Why are you standing here? Brother, I thought you were going to leave us like Dad did. Don't be silly. I went to buy food. Here you go. Get your sis to come out. There's food. Sis, come and eat something. What's that? - Brother. - Tuck in. - Fried chicken. My favourite. - Fried chicken. My favourite. Brother. Where did you get the money? Are you still helping the loan sharks? Sheesh. Don't sweat the small stuff. Nicole. Why don't you go back to school tomorrow? That white scarf looks ugly on you. Look. I got you a hat. See? Let me help you put it on. What's wrong? Do I still look pretty? Yes, you look very pretty. You're not only pretty. I hope that when Mum wakes up, I can proudly tell her that you're still the top student. Okay? Brother, yesterday, I dreamt that Mum woke up. She'll definitely wake up because I've been a good boy. Yes, you're the best. We're the naughty ones. No, you're the best elder brother in the world. You eat like a glutton. You want to quit the gang? Are you sure? The police just informed me that my dad has been arrested. My siblings need me now since my mum is still in a coma. If I get caught, what's going to happen to them? As for the debt, I'll settle it with Boss. I'll look for a job and pay him back by instalments. As long as I return the money, Boss will allow me to quit, right? That's easier said than done. It's not just about paying off debts. We aren't the Boy Scouts who can just pack up and leave when we find it boring. Leaving a gang isn't so simple. If it was, I would've left long ago. But I'm really done with splashing paint. You're aware of the danger and implications too. I don't want to do this either. It gets more frightening by the day. The police are all out to catch the loan sharks. I don't want to end up in prison. But I dare not tell Boss. Why don't we talk to him together? We can back each other up. It makes things easier, right? It's hard enough for a gang member to call it quits, let alone two. Look, Boss just wants us to splash paint and harass the debtors. Why don't we invent a device which does that and ask him to let us leave? It's worth a shot. He spends so much time in school. From his behaviour and body language you should've known that he has joined a gang. Madam Phua, the school rules are very clear. As long as something happens within the school compound we'll take all the necessary action. But now, this happened outside the school. There's nothing we can do. Actually, Madam Phua, when I paid you a visit previously I wanted to remind you to show more concern for your son. But you didn't have time for me. I believe you didn't have time for him either. That's not the point. And I couldn't have spent much time with him since he was seldom at home. If you really want to save your son, I suggest you go to the police. - Go to the police? - Yes. Do you know what you're talking about? - Go to the police? - What's wrong? She's actually Madam Cynthia Phua, a motivator and the TV presenter for the programme, Dawn's Moment. Really? I'm sorry. I don't watch such programmes. It's okay. Mr Discipline Master, if I go to the police the whole world will know that my son is a loan shark. My career will be totally ruined. This is impossible. Actually, I've tried to talk to him many times but he refused to listen to me. See? It's your fault in this case. There's a communication breakdown between you and the kids. Did you identify their needs? Did you satisfy their needs? If you want to satisfy their needs, you need to have a common language. - You need to know their lingo and... - Excuse me. Do you really want to save your son? Yes, of course. I suggest you talk to his gang leader. Gang leader? These are their hangouts. I just got the list. Don't tell them. I wasn't supposed to do that. Once you lose hope, you'll lose sight of your future. You just need to keep your head up and you'll know you have a choice. Do you understand? It's just like playing pool. After you hit the ball, it has no say over where it's going. But you aren't a ball. You're a human being. Therefore, you have a choice. Hey, auntie. You're such a nag. Aren't you sick of droning on and on? Excuse me, Mr Qiang. May I correct you? Don't call me auntie because nothing could be further from the truth. You can call me Madam Phua or Mentor Phua as other people do. I'm fine with either form of address. Are you here to strip on your son's behalf? Strip? Why must I strip? To strip means to quit the gang. I see. That's your lingo. Yes. I'm here to help him quit the gang. How should I go about it? What are you doing here? - Son, you came at the right time. - Why did you come here? I've spoken to your leader and he has agreed to let you strip. - You must thank him. - Hey, auntie. Don't jump the gun. When did I say I'd let him strip? Take your mother away. Guys, see this old auntie out. Now, you're calling me old auntie. That's atrocious. - Move it. Just go home. - Don't be back too late. - Go home. - Don't touch me. Don't come home too late. I'll brew soup for you, okay? All right, goodbye. Boss, there's something which we'd like to discuss with you. What is it? We want to strip. Strip? Why? Boss, as you know, it's too risky to collect debts in Singapore now. The police are hot on our heels. We don't want to go to jail. Do you think you can leave at your whim and fancy? Am I so soft-headed to you? You're mistaken, Boss. We wish to invent a device for you. It will be able to collect debts, splash paint and do the job on all our gang brothers' behalf. Even if there's a raid, the police will just confiscate the device. Our brothers will be fine. You're just from International Technological Polytechnic. If you were so smart, you would've gone to Raffles Institution. Boss, please don't look down on students from ITP, all right? Yes, we have our talents too. Fine, go ahead and invent the device. Don't just pay lip service which I can do better than you guys. If you can prove your worth, I'll let you leave. - Thank you, Boss. - Thank you, Boss. Don't thank me yet. Before the device is ready, go splash paint on these two units. That's all for now. Pass it to me. What are you doing? I'm just a lone ranger while you have your siblings to take care of. It's settled. Just go back first. See you tonight. I'll be all right. Damian. What are you doing here? I followed you all the way here. Son, I beg of you. Don't do this anymore. It's illegal. If you're caught, you'll be finished. That's my choice. Just leave me alone. Don't talk to me like that. I know I'm putting you on the spot by asking you to stop doing this and your leader probably won't let you off the hook too. So I've thought of a win-win solution. I've got someone to do the job for you. Who? Hi, Sir. - Maria? - Yes. - Our maid, Maria? - That's right. Son, she's got nothing to do anyway. Wait for me. I have Proposal B. This is awesome. And there are even images. Boss, the best is yet to come. Boss, is this the guy we're looking for? Yes, it's him. He never repays his debt. You idiot. Instead of repaying your debt, you're enjoying coffee here? Please spare me. Let me show you my true colours. Pay me back the money now or I'll be nastier to you. Repay your debt This is impressive. Can you spray the paint on the door? That's the style of loan sharks. It's like our signature dish. Boss, this is even better. Spraying paint on the door is outdated. This device can enter his house and spray the paint on his walls. It can even do that? - No problem. - Boss, look. We can spray the paint now. Repay your debt She has been alerted. Retreat. Stop. It's over there. I spotted it. Great. Pass it to me. I can't believe this was invented by ITP students like you. This device is powerful, but can you improve on the functions? What other functions do you want? For example, make it emit flames. - Emit flames? - Emit flames? Yes, some idiots refused to pay up and they even went to the police. I want to burn them alive. Boss, you want to kill them? I just want to threaten them, not kill them. Can you do it? We'll try. Good. That's settled. Oh yes, there's going to be a drone competition in Malaysia. It's for the rich who have nothing better to do. The team with the drone that can withstand the heaviest weight and fly the furthest will win a hundred thousand dollars. It's a hundred thousand dollars. If you win, I'll take seventy thousand dollars and you can keep the rest and leave the gang. Are you happy with that? Boss, that requires more advanced technical skills. I'm afraid we may not be up to it. Don't dismiss the idea just yet. Have more faith in yourselves. Give it a shot. Okay, so that's a deal. Yes? Mr Liew, we need your help. Sure. Our boss wants us to invent a powerful drone to take part in a competition in Malaysia and win the prize money for him. Then he'll let us quit the gang. Good. Let's do it. But on one condition. With this drone, we will represent the school to take part in the National Creative Invention Competition. - Are we on? - We're on. We're on. This is... - Yeah! - Yeah! Good job. We're installing a video recorder for flight recording. And this GPS transmitter. GPS transmitter? Yes. If there's a mishap during the flight at least we can still find it. Touch wood, of course. - Let me study this at home. - Okay. Do you know that every time I complete a project I can't help but feel like I'm its father? I'll want to do my best to protect it and hope that it can be a good kid. If anything happens to it, I'll be very sad. My wife will be giving birth soon, so this feeling has intensified. I'm starting to feel like I'm its father too. Really? I share the same feeling too. This is such a lucky kid with three fathers. I need to leave. - Okay. - Hello? Goodbye. Okay. All right, it's show time. - Get the stuff. - Okay. Actually, we're quite smart. You're right. Why do people look down on us? Think about this. When Boss gets to keep this after the competition he'll be the only loan shark in the world with his own air fleet. You're right. Repay your debt Actually, that's a scary thought. If he goes crazy and uses this flame-spewing device to seek revenge and commit murder, how will we live with ourselves? Heck, why don't we just remove the flame-spewing function? Yes. We'll just tell him we're dumb and failed to meet his expectations. I don't care if he looks down on us. - Let's remove that function. - Okay. Did you say this was an invention by students from Raffles Institution? No, they're from ITP. - ITP? - Yes. - No way. - You find it unbelievable, right? So did I initially. That was great. Boss could hardly believe his eyes. Geez. I can't believe this device could withstand such a heavy load and cover such a long distance. If you had been talent-spotted by Osama bin Laden the world would've been in danger. Run a final check. We're heading to Kuala Lumpur for the competition tomorrow. Tomorrow? But we aren't done yet. We need to paint it, beautify it and install light bulbs. - Light bulbs? - Yes. We have to dress it up. We don't need light bulbs. It's not Christmas. This competition is about mileage and load-carrying capacity. It's not a fashion competition, okay? Okay, run a check to ensure it won't crash. Don't embarrass Singaporeans. If Malaysia can do it, so can Singapore, okay? We can all do it. Okay. Damian, I have good news for you. Look, I submitted your application to this college in the United States. They did me a huge favour and approved it. We can leave immediately. Just leave me alone. I've made all these arrangements for the sake of your future. How many times must I tell you to mind your own business? Go love your younger son. It's done. The flight records for Loan Shark Two have been downloaded to your laptop. They're all in this folder. - Good, I'll take a look later. - Okay. With this information, I can make Loan Shark Two even better. Why are you so late? Don't get me started. Look at our baby. - Yes, it's ready. - All right. - Take it away. - Okay, we're ready to go. - Let's go. - Hey, I forgot to ask you. - Where will the competition be held? - Kuala Lumpur. What a coincidence. I'll be going there with my wife. - We're visiting my father-in-law. - Really? I'll show up to support you if I can find the time. But we're not sure where exactly the competition will be held. Have you forgotten about the GPS function on Loan Shark Two? You're right. Okay, we should get going. - Go. - Okay. Mr Liew, thank you. We've given you an A grade for the teacher's appraisal. Get out of here. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Did you say this was an invention by students from Raffles Institution? No, they're from ITP. - ITP? - Yes. - No way. - You find it unbelievable, right? So did I initially. - They're smart, right? - Absolutely. Actually, we can go for mass production and sell this device. Settle the shipment from Johor Bahru to Singapore first. Focus on that tomorrow. - Are these two kids reliable? - Yes. If they aren't, I'll get rid of them. You know how I work. I'll kill them even if you don't. The subscriber you're calling is currently unavailable. The subscriber you're calling is currently unavailable. Hello? Yes, dear. Yes. Okay. I'll come over now. If Dad wasn't so sick, I would've just stayed at home to rest. Although this is an away game, but don't worry. We'll surely win. Selena, help me to cancel all my appointments. If Mr Tee asks where his car is tell him I drove his car to Johor Bahru. Nobody would want his car anyway, so I'd be very safe. Okay? Remember that. Goodbye. Dear, I need you to check our location. Move that icon. Is this the one? It's done. Can you see the green icon? Yes. Okay. The blue icon represents our car. Please direct me towards the green icon. What does the green icon represent? The shortcut to your father's house. Okay. We'll pass through two streets first. - Go straight and then turn. - Okay. Boss, isn't the competition in Kuala Lumpur? Why are we still in Johor Bahru? I forgot to mention that they changed the venue. It's in Johor Bahru now. We're getting closer to the green icon. It's just a few more metres away. But why are we in a forested place? Where are you taking me to? Your father's house. My father's house? The road ahead is the shortcut. Shortcut? We don't even know where we are now. I'm so tired. I'll take a nap. Sleep tight. I have to think positive. I can do it. Okay, you can alight now. Boss, we're here. You're smart and talented. You're the hope for the country. But what a shame that you aren't studying in Raffles Institution. It's not a shame for you but definitely a shame for Raffles Institution. Am I right? I was just joking. Qiang, get it done quickly. - Don't drag your feet. - Okay. I have a spa appointment with the Dato. Boss, what's going on? It's the competition. The competition is about to start. Get Loan Shark Two ready for flight. Boss, it feels weird here. I won't get you into trouble. You just have to launch Loan Shark Two towards Singapore and we can claim our prize money. It's as simple as that, right? Tie this to the drone. What's this? It's the prize money. Could it possibly be... drugs? I'm not such an evil person, okay? And he's not an evil person too even though he looks like one. Don't be misled by the movies. In reality, you can't judge a book by its cover. If someone looks like a bad guy, that means he isn't one. - What's inside then? - Let's open it to take a look. Don't do that. Don't you trust me? This parcel is from the organisers. We have no right to question them. This is the rule. I know I look like a bad guy just like what you see in the movies. And in fact, I'm a bad guy too. Movies are never misleading. Here, this pack of drugs costs one million Singapore dollars. Boss, can you please try to be more subtle? What's your problem? Why must we lie to them? Didn't your teacher tell you that lying is bad? Here. Hold this. Just secure it to your drone, send it over to Singapore and you'll get the prize money of a hundred thousand dollars, okay? Is this from Thailand? No, we bought it on the internet. Internet? Do it fast. It's going to rain. Do it now. This is great. Great. Hello? The eagle catches the little chick. It's flying to the Singapore Zoo now. Is Ah Meng in the cage already? Ah Meng is already waiting in the cage. Sheesh. What are you talking about? Boss, these are secret codes. Both of you, watch out. Don't let it fly too high or else it'll be detected by the radar. Don't let it fly too low either as it'll be spotted by the police. Ah Meng is already waiting in the cage. Is breakfast coming? It'll be served soon. How is it going? Relax. Singaporeans are very efficient. Fine, I'll reward you later, braggart. Control it. This is strange. It's going in the wrong direction. Be a good boy. I'm your father. We've lost control. We can't seem to control the drone. Where's the video feed? What happened? Is everything all right? Don't try to pull any tricks. - Let me do it. - I'll control it. Can we go now? You're awake? I thought you were napping. Go catch forty more winks. This is strange. You hold it. Control it. You take over. Good grief, Dear. Give it back to me. Sheesh. Just share your toy with me. Keep it steady. Control it. Okay, that's enough. Let me fly it higher. Good grief. No. It's not working. My goodness. It's back. - Yes. - But it's not controlled by us. - What? - Boss, this is too dangerous. - Let's get out of here. - Don't you run away. You have to get it back for me. Okay. Keep it steady. Control it. We're losing control. Run! Good grief. Look, it has crashed. This isn't fun. I'm going to look for the plane. - Come back soon. - Okay. Holy shit. Madam Phua? Madam Phua. These drugs are worth more than your lives. You must get them back by hook or by crook. Boss, I saw the drone fly over there. I'm sure we can find the drugs there. I'll be back. If we can't find the drugs, it's going to be crazy for us. Let's go. The teacher? Crap, you betrayed me. Beat them to a pulp. Move it, guys. - Look for him over there. - Yes. It's over there. Leave my drone alone. This is mine, okay? I'll be back for you later. It's flying. Go after it. What a nuisance. It's the police. No. - Oh no. - We're in deep trouble. Let's inform Boss. Hurry. Sorry, son. I have to hand you over to the police first. I won't let you become an evil tool. Now, I'll rescue your other two fathers. I'll be back to save you later. Hello. Why is it so noisy over there? I'm pooping. Can you come back soon? My tummy feels very uncomfortable. Oh yes, remember to lock the car doors. If those two students of mine come by to hitch a ride, let them hop in. I'll be back after answering nature's call. Okay? Hello? Hello? - Boss, we didn't betray you. - Yes, Boss. Our teacher was the meddlesome one. We didn't even know he was here. Do you think I'll buy your story? If you had nailed this mission we would've earned a hundred thousand dollars. But you just had to play tricks and mess everything up. - Boss. - You idiot. Cut the crap about Singaporeans being efficient. You couldn't even handle such a simple task. I lost one million dollars as a result. One million dollars. No, Boss. - Please don't kill me. - Boss, kill me instead. He still has siblings to look after while I'm all alone. No one cares about me anyway. So kill me. - Okay. - No, Damian. You want to be the hero? - Fine, I'll grant your wish. - Just kill me. - No. - Boss, you can't shoot him. The police will be able to hear the gunshot. Use the knife instead. Pass me the gun. Use the knife. No. - No. - Okay, let me tell you. Before I became a gangster, I used to chop coconuts in the kampong. I always did a good job. - Who's that? - Damian. - Mum? - Go away. Damian. You, go away. How could you say that no one cares about you? - Who's this auntie? - I care about you. - Leave now. - What's this auntie doing here? - Your mother... - Who are you scolding? I was just referring to his mother. Boss, I suggest that you chop the old coconut first before moving on to the young ones. This old coconut can be such a pain in the neck. - I've experienced it firsthand. - Son. Okay, since you've held me captive, release these two kids. You can do whatever you want to me. I'm okay with it. That's because I'm a positive person and a motivator. Although the odds are against me I believe that as long as I keep the faith and never give up I'll overcome all obstacles. I'll never relent, admit defeat or give up. I'll become stronger as I soldier on. I believe where there's risk, there's hope. You just want to tear your hair out, right? No. I want to tear yours too. Pass me the knife. No. Don't hurt them. Your parcel is with me. Come and get it if you dare. - Come after me if you dare. Come on. - After him. Those fools are gone. Release me now. - How? - Go behind me. Pick up that piece of paper on the ground. Help me up. CK wrote in Chinese. I don't understand. You read it. I failed my Chinese. Heck, why did you refuse to heed my advice to learn Chinese? Fortunately, I'm bilingual. - What did he write? - Let me see. Gosh, your teacher's handwriting is terrible. But it's okay. I can still make out the words. - Heck, let's read it along the way. - Okay. Come on. Crap, he runs faster than a dog. Why are all of you here? Who's keeping an eye on the trio? Let's go. Hurry. - Hello? - Dear, where exactly are you? I'm feeling really queasy in the tummy. Dear, I'm still pooping. You're still pooping? Didn't you say the baby and I would be your top priority? - He's over there! - Boss, don't shoot. - There are police officers around. - Go after him! Hello? Stop running. His pooping actually matters more than me. Hurry. Your teacher wrote that his car is on the opposite hill. His wife is in the car and her baby is due very soon. We have to drive her to the hospital immediately and get the police to rescue him. - They're catching up. Hurry. - My leg. My leg hurts. I think it's dislocated. - Come up now. - Pass me the gun. - Auntie, they're coming. Hurry. - Mum, hang in there. Hurry. Hurry. - It's hurting a lot. - They're catching up. - Let her lie down here. - Put me down. Mum, your leg is dislocated. It's just dislocated, not broken. It can be fixed. Think positive, okay? Think positive. Auntie, hang in there. We're reaching the top of the hill. The car is just up there. I'll take you there, okay? No. Listen to me. Don't bother carrying me. Drive Mrs Liew to the hospital immediately, okay? Don't let me slow you down. If we let those armed gangsters catch up with us, we'll all die. Auntie, what about you then? I will hide here. They won't be able to see me since the undergrowth is so thick. They won't discover me. I've got my way. Where there's risk, there's hope. I can't leave you behind. Think positive. You're seeking help, okay? Oh no, they're coming. Run along. Seek help. - Run along now. Be good kids. - Be careful. - I'll be fine. - We'll get the police. - Let's go. - Don't worry. - There are police officers around. - Don't give me that crap. Stop right there! Crap, how do we climb up? - Let's try the other side. - Okay. Crap, stop running. Idiotic crooks, I'm here. Come look for me, idiots. - Stay right there. - I'm over here, idiots. Come over here now, idiots. Yes! - This... - I can't do this. It'll weigh on my conscience. I must go back and save my mum. Wait. Oh dear, look, she has peed due to shock. Sorry, I'm a lousy driver. Wait here. I'll go back and save my mum, okay? - My amniotic sac just broke. - Amniotic sac? - The baby's coming out. - Baby? What should we do? - Take me to that hut. - That one? You have to assist me as I give birth. - We don't know how to. - We don't know how to. I'll guide you along. Hurry, help me. - Let's go. - Okay. - What should we do? - What do we do now? There's a luggage in the car. - Luggage? Let's go get it. - Go get it. - Is this the one? - Is this the one? There are scissors and a towel inside. Open the luggage. - Open it. - Okay. Great. I found the towel. Here's the towel. The scissors. We can't find the scissors. Can you make do with a nail clipper? It's too small. It can't be used. Okay. There's a bigger nail clipper. Is that fine? Who uses a nail clipper for childbirth? Where are the scissors? We found them. Remove my shoes. Place the towel under my hips. Okay. The towel. Here you go. - Okay. - The towel is in place. What's next? Remove my pants. - Your pants? - Your pants? Hurry, there's no time to think. Okay. We'll take one side each. Okay. The pants are off. What's next? Remove my panties. She wants us to remove her panties? - We... - We can't do this to Mr Liew. If the baby dies, you won't be able to answer to Mr Liew. What should we do? All right, we'll do it. Here we go. Okay. The panties are off. What's next? Grab me. - Grab your hands? - Okay. Push. - Push. - Push. Is it okay? Look between my legs. - We have to look? - We'd better not. - Hurry. Look between my legs. - Okay. What do you see? - Hair. - Hair. And what else? The baby's hair. - I see the baby's head. - The baby's head is coming out. - The baby's head is coming out. - I see the baby's head. Come on. Push harder, come on. One, two. One, two, three. You must push harder. No, I can't do it anymore. The opening is too small. The baby can't come out. - What should we do? - What should we do? - The scissors. - The scissors? - Here are the scissors. - Slit the opening. Slit the opening? Without anaesthetics, it'll hurt terribly. I can't do it. I don't care about the pain now. I'm not afraid. Hurry. Jianren, you do it. - I can't. I'm afraid of blood. No. - Are you kidding me? You're used to fights and bloodshed, yet you're afraid of this? This is different from that kind of bloodshed. No, I can't do it. Jianren, you're a coward. How could you chicken out when it comes to the crunch? - Do it, Jianren. - This isn't the time for a chat. Hurry up or the baby will suffocate. Be careful. Don't hurt the baby. Okay. Does every mother have to go through this? If I'm nabbed, I won't tell them about you. That's because you're not a mother to me. Witch, how dare you hit me! - Mum. - Mum. (Malay) Don't worry. We'll find Mr Liew. Mum. Mum. - Damian. - Auntie. Are you okay? Auntie, thank you for saving us. Don't mention it. I'm really fine. Mum. Think positive. Mum. I'm really sorry. Don't cry. Excuse me, boys. We just arrested two suspects and we need more information from you. Can you help us? - Sure. - Come. Sir, take a look. Crap, I'll get you. The latitude is 2.88866, the longitude is 102, 0.37582. It's just further up north. Can you go rescue him now? Are you still trying to flee? There's nowhere you can go. Crap. You messed up my hair. Kill him. Crap, you messed up my hair again. Damn. Kill him. How dare you mess up my hair! Get lost. Damn. So you think you're a good fighter? I lost one million dollars because of you. You've got to pay the price with your life. - Police. - What police? That's what you shout whenever I try to shoot. It's very irritating. Go to hell. Police. Hands up. Teacher who ran naked fought drug lord and saved his students Teacher and students teamed up to fight against the drug traffickers Although we improved on the design of Loan Shark Two we still lost the competition. But we weren't discouraged because we've learnt to think positive. There's an upside and a downside to everything. It all depends on the choice you make. Like Mr Liew said naughty kids may choose to blame their parents and even society but eventually, they're the ones who have to go to jail and get caned. Not all parents have good parenting skills. By hating your parents, you're actually punishing yourself. You should take charge of your own future. As long as you don't give up on yourself the society won't give up on you. As long as you keep the faith you'll be a winner in everything you do. Although we didn't win the competition the police recognised our creative talents and decided to award us scholarships. Hi, big brother. I'm so proud of you. You're my hero. Can I have an autograph? Here? Sure. Here. - Thank you, big brother. - You're welcome. Mr Liew. Dad, Mum, let me introduce my teacher to you. - Mr Liew, they're my parents. - It's very nice to meet you. - Hello. - Mr and Mrs Ong. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you, Mr Liew. I'm such a useless mother. I actually mistook this piece of jade for a stone. Mum, if Brother is a piece of jade, what are we then? Actually, you're all diamonds. Your mum and I will spend more time to help you shine and you'll only get brighter. And then you'll pawn us? No. Hey, Mrs Ong. Hello, everyone. Let me tell you. Think positive. Many parents are like us. They've never discovered the gems at home. But I'm different. I've always known that I have two pieces of emerald at home. But I had no time for them and I let them shine on their own. As a result, they lost their lustre. Fortunately, they didn't become worthless stones. I have to thank this teacher. Thank you very much, CK. Don't mention it. They're already very bright kids. That's true. They're very brave too. I think my mum is more courageous than me. Yes, my mother is my hero. So when are you going to teach me perfect English? Anytime. And can you teach me Singlish? No. Ladies and gentlemen, please get ready for the awards ceremony. And you can drop the gang. Drop the gang? It should be "leave the gang". And you can drop the gang. Leave the gang. Gosh. And you can drop the gang. Are you happy with that? Leave the gang. Gosh. You're also a son. He's also your son. Cut. And action. And action. You haven't... You... Fine, I'll eat it. I can't stuff it down my throat anymore. - Give him a tissue, hurry. - Okay. - Read it along the way. - Okay. He wrote that... Cut. - She sprained her ankle. - Be careful. Weijie, stop. Let's go. I really want to help you. Cut. Okay? What? Next, let's hear some insights from the Member of Parliament, Madam Tan. Madam Tan. The camera panned this way? Our budget is limited. Therefore... - Mr Boi. - Thank you. I think there are two sides to this incident. I've forgotten the upside. Thank you. Sorry. - What should we do? - What should we do? - The scissors. - The scissors? Where are the scissors? The scissors. Okay. Teck and Lim... Sorry. Jack, sorry. Hello? Okay. Sorry. Stop laughing. Okay, one more time. Teck and Lim found the Geylang boss at the Geylang Beer Garden. The Geylang boss is at the Geylang Beer Garden. You're smart, aren't you? Why did it turn out this way? Translator: SPECTRA MEDIA
