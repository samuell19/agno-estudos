"Adela Has Not Had Dinner Yet" Always on guard Kuratko, Nick's helper, delivering mail, noticing the harvest of defeated evil, thus commented to the point: What a day again! Clean it up Always the same. When the chestnut ¨ is too hot for the police then Carter has to do. Scotland Yard, Sûreté Paris, what to do first. Who will be the lucky one? Director of Police, Prague City. Where is that, Prague? In Vienna. So...? Mysterious disappearance in an important family come immediately, will pay any price. Interesting offer! We have not sorted out the King's gang yet! Can you handle them alone? -- Sure - it's only one gang! Shall I pack your bags? - Hmm. First some necessary information about those Antipodeans. Of course I wasn't mistaken. It's almost in Vienna. Locals use some kind of Slavic language. Well, I'll have plenty of time to learn it aboard the ship. Peculiar people! -- Will you use your famous perfect disguises? I will just melt into the crowd! "Czech Quick and Easy" Prague Terminal! Beer! Beer! Drinking water! Mr Carter! Welcome to Prague! I'm the Director of Police, Knight Franz von Kaunitz. How did you recognize me? Who wouldn't read about your famous disguises Let me introduce... Commissar? One second Hot dogs...hot dogs... --Commissar Ledvina! Josef Ledvina [Joseph Kidney] I assume my arrival has been kept strictly secret! -- But of course! The most famous American detective's in Prague!.... Ye know, can't keep a secret here.... To your success, Mr Carter! Say what you want - Pilsen's the best! -- Pilsen? Famous local beer. The liquid bread of the Czech nation. Damn that's some baggage! -- God be with ye! Please Present from my friend Edison! Why would ye drag that along? -- A modern detective can't be behind the times! The allies of his are physick, chymistry, and the realm of science altogether. Yeah, some ass-kicking can also do. Let's get to the point, gentlemen! --Thanks man! Mr Carter, the case is unusually mysterious. --No other cases are of my interest! It has taken place in the bedroom of the wife of Duke Tuna who therefore refuses any involvement of the police. However this noble lady has entrusted me to... ...she is a great admirer of yours... ...to get you involved in this this case of mysterious disapperance. Whose disappearance? The lady will explain everything. Here, a preliminary gesture of her gratitude... Preliminary one, indeed...! I work on my own. However, I'm a stranger and cannot get by without some information. Of course; that's why you'll have Commissar Ledvina at your disposal. A man Prague holds no secrets from! Alright then. Tomorrow - investigation at the crime scene, this afternoon a sightseeing tour! --Sure! So let's go sightseeing, then! Eureka! It's weeping! The plant is weeping! --Congratulations, sir! Did he arrive? -- Yes, sir! He's staying at the Hotel Paris. He has conferred with the Director of Police, is sightseeing now and tomorrow will start investigating, sir! Good! If he wants to investigate, he must open the jail of my Adela! Of course, sir! By tomorrow night, Adela will be back in your hands, sir! I didn't cut you off a hangman's rope for nothing! If only that American dick knew he's paving the way for my revenge! He's full of himself...Can't handle us! No way, sir! Keep him in sight; even a mosquito can sting! My people aren't asleep, sir! Truly antique monument. From the Dark Middle Ages, isn't it. Damn dark! That's why we put gas lights here! And the statues - are they hand-made? --O' course, everything's hand-made here. What wouldn't we do for the tourists-folks! All the talkin' made me tong dusty! Have you drunk Pilsen before? No? Please! So? Another famous place; frequented by King Wenceslas. But mainly they sell great sausages here. And Pilsen? Beautiful! One can just feel the spirit of history! Yeah, strong spirit, I see! If you're interested in history, I call this a historical date. [Estd. 1499] Flekovsky beer was born... Where is the carpel...? That terrible dream again... You won't escape my revenge, you old Satan! 5 o'clock; we're going home! Thanks, Commissar! Prague took me away... The old palaces, the great cathedrals... And we have not even visited at the Pinkas pub. There's a bartender there who just cuddles the beer! Always on guard. --Let's go home... The Lady's awaiting ye. Fit again... Well, Commissar; pay me back. Hit me. Go on, no worry. --As you wish! You don't box? -- You know, we slap. No, in this country, I can't get by without you. [Nick Carter, greatest detective of America. Nick's biggest trumph] "You've won, Nick Carter!" whispered the scoundrel. "Say hello to the devil, Gardener" said calmly the great detective. Soon the criminal's face, contorted with hatred, disappeared in the smelly swamp. That was the end of the king of crime, known in New York as The Gardener. Bravo! What a pity my dear Gert has not lived to see the end of The Gardener! My dear! You talk about Gert as if he were dead! Until that famous detective's had his last word, you must keep hoping! You are so kind...have you forgiven Gert? Sure. Such a little transgretion... But I think Carter won't be around this morning. Why? -- Apparently he got extremely tired from all the sightseeing! Lady!-- Yes! Oh, he's not tired! -- Tell him to come in! Interesting!--Excuse me, please; I am supposed to be chairing a meeting of a Committee for Protection of Widows and Orphans! He's so lovely excentric!--Welcome, sir! When dear Gert disappeared so mysteriously behind those doors, I put some radical measures in place, so until your arrival the crime scene was not disturbed. Praiseworthy foresight! --I learned that from you! Karin, my favourite reading? -- Dante, Goethe, and Nick Carter novels! Hm, sign of good taste! Sorry The key! Your testimony first, please. I'll bother Miss Karyn at later time. Yes...at any time... Gert... At this place I was playing his lullaby for the last time. Lullaby? -- He wouldn't sleep without it. This was his favourite corner. He loved the smell of flowers. This is the only thing left of him. I beg you pardon? Yes?--Nothing but the collar. Gert was a - dog? -- Yes. Only he understood me! Indeed. A dog is man's best friend, after all. Please tell me everything. That fateful evening... I was getting ready to put myself in the bed with the help of my assistant, as usually. Any the keen Gert was doing the same! When Karyn left the room, I locked all the windows and doors, as Gert was terrified of robbers. I made sure he was set up for the night, not knowing I was seeing him for the last time. Pardon me, sir...! --Noble feelings require no excuses. Thank you! Then I sat down at the spinet Please, go on! and began singing his favourite Mozart lullaby. It's my favourite, too! ♪ Sleep my little prince sleep ♪ ♪ the birds and the lambs watch will keep ♪ ♪ silent each flower and tree ♪ ♪ hushed is the hum of the bee ♪ ♪ see the moon's silvery rays... ♪ The lady was ringing the bell madly. I quickly ran over and could hardly comprehend at first what had just happened. But then I saw: There was only the collar... And Gert... had disappeared as if into thin air! We looked high and low for him... without luck. Gert has disappeared! Only then the Lady had pronounced the saving word: "Carter!" Thank you, Miss! I have no more questions! --Really? Pity... Good-bye, Miss Karyn! -- Yes! She chases you hard! --- Commissar! We're not at the pub! ♪ Sleep my little prince sleep ♪ ♪ the birds and the lambs watch will keep ♪ What a distant memory... Mysterious case. Dog? -- Gone! I know that even without you! --Not the dog! The sausage! It was here a moment ago! --Enough! I'm in the middle of an investigation and you are still only concerned about those... What's that? Paper! Greasy paper! National Newspaper. My sausage was wrapped in that newspaper. It fell out of that flower! It ate the sausage and spat the paper out! Calm! An expert crime investigator cannot jump to conclusions! It must've eaten the dog, too! A daring hypothesis!--Just look at it how it's perked up! You bastard! You like eating others' food, huh! Don't get carried away by anger! Now you'll find out by interrogation how did this plant get here. And I'll borrow this for my laboratory. Looks like you're in demand, my little one! Thank you!--Please order a big portion of the sausages for my room! --At your service! Good afternoon! The sausages! --About time. Put them on the table. We were waiting for fresh ones, sir! They'll just melt in your mouth! And the smell! Just try it! As you can see, it was no one of my staff. Yeah? And how about that midget who run away? There's a black sheep in every flock.... Get the hell out you....shepherd! At your service! Have you discovered anything new at the palace, Commissar? Nope! No-one knows how the plant got there. We have lost the battle, but we'll win the war! You needs fresh air, some Pilsen beer, and you're gonna be good! Eat, Adelka, yum-yum! You haven't eaten for a long time! Lucky the dog was so big and meaty! Peeing on my leg, that doesn't pay off. At least we know now what you can do! So, has the detective sniffed anything out yet? --Chloroform, sir! -- Sorry, sir! To be frank, I don't wish to meet Nick! Impossible, sir - I have his every step under observation! Bravo! - Here, hold this! Now I'll start the infernal device of my revenge! Grandpa! Look, grandpa! The General Butterfly, grandpa! Admiral, my dear, Admiral! And what've you caught, grandpa? --Ehm, Ami Vastlandu; only good for the old man with one food in the grave... But you have such a strong root, grandpa! What's this? I don't know this... --Well, let's see - "Rosa Alba Dexteri" on a Czech meddow. It is a rare sight, yet explicable. Tiny seeds of this Ethiopian plant are brought to Egypt by rugged entrapial in its digestive track. It is the favorite pray of waggus impus which winters there. Which then transfers them on the cilium of its rostrum back into our homeland! Almighty Nature! I see you are also a botanist! Baron Ruppert von Kratzmar? Private doctor at the Faust University in Wienerschnitzelberg? Oh my god! Such an honour! Let me introduce my granddaugter Miss Kvetuse Bockova. And my name's Albin Bocek, professor of plant sciences and animal biology at a gymnasium, retired. You are the author of the collossal work "Flowers of the Jindrichohradec area with the special consideration of riverbed cartias"? Sins of one's youth, Baron! --Leave the Baron, my dear colleague! I'd be very honoured if you would autograph this copy. My pleasure! I'd be delighted to welcome the Baron - colleague - at this evening in my modest abode. We shall look through herbariums, drink some ground coffee and eat some apple pie, that Kvetus has made. May I hope my dear colleague?... Herbariums, coffee and apple pie? I can't wait! The evening is set! That mysterious plant! Key to the case of the dog's disappearance... --The dog's eaten! --But Commissar! A small smoked sausage is not the same as a dog the size of a calf! There is no plant big enough to devour a bite of this size! True, I did know someone who... No! Impossible! He's been dead for a long time! The fresh air certainly does miracles! The aromatic gardens, the lilacs.... Phwee! What's that? --Olomouc cheese. Nicely ripen/decomposed. Europe is decomposing... Grandpa! The red mineral butterfly! General, my darling! I mean - Admiral! Yellow Butterfly, grandpa... Hush... My girl...you're home! The gentlemen kindly ordered a coach. This is Mr Josef Ledvina, the maker of stripes and this is his nephew Mr Nick Ledvina, Czecho-American, currently visiting the old country. By the way, have you happened to meet young Matejka in America? He's the stepson of my sister-in-law. --I haven't had the pleasure. --No?? --I work as a Magician. Walking out into the street I had left my work hat on and the misfortune was done. --No, Mr Magician! It was all due to my collector's weakness... I am a bit shaken up...excuse me for a second.... Gentlemen - please, sit down! Professor, may I ask a question relating to your field? It concerns an exotic plant. Exotic plant? My friend! I only know the Czech plants! But if you wait here for an hour, you will be answered by the foremost expert in just that area! He's a Baron! In the meantime, let me bring some dandelion wine! --Dandelion? It's a true elixir of youth! I have some every day and being almost 80, my heart beats like a bell still! And liver like a rock! What else awaits me here?... Commissar! Who's that? Some boy...and he's scrawling on the wall. --Or a masked midget! Always on guard, Commissar! That's why you'll go down to the pub. -- Sure! And you will not let the street out of your sight! Well, they have some rubbish on beer there, but it still beats some dandelion glop! Welcome, dear collegue Baron! What a visit! I'll take him to the study, my girl. Have you wiped the dust off there? Of course, grandpa! Mr Magician, may I show you my butterfly collection? I'd be honoured.... Every science is fantastic, especially botanic! With greatest workfellow regards... How wonderful, you also a poet? --Sometimes I tease the Muse! But my permanent consort is only with God's plants! You've been busy! The gem of Kargasovice paddocks: - Peterka Pidlakova! Plum jam Pidlak! --Truly charming! I know. You have even more beautiful butterflies in America.--Yes, we do! Well, we're a country of unlimited opportunity! But I've found the most beatiful butterfly here! In the Lesser Town of Prague. Watch the step, collegue Baron! --Good evening, sir! Your servant, Miss! The pride of my glasshouse! --You didn't need to.... Oh how adorable! Every inch of this place is warmed up by the touch of the female hand! Kvetus's good at warming... and not just by her hand! Last year she made a whole drum of sauerkraut! And now, would you bring the coffee, my girl. Come and join us, dear friend! This is the Czech-American magician. Nick Ledvina (Kidney) Pleased to meet you, I'm Ruppert von Kratzmar! Excuse me, Baron; have we met before? Gentlemen - to the table! --What's wrong, Baron? Migraine. An inherited curse of my family! You need some dandelion wine! --No, (never!) Only the solitude of my bedroom will deliver relief. Terrible illness tortures my family for centuries! Yeah, degeneration is no fun. Please... I'd be honoured if you and Kvetus came to visit me at home. You'll see an unusual sight - feeding of a carnivorous plant! Carnivourous! Horrific! I'll look forward to that! --No more than myself! So, day after tomorrow at 3 pm my cab will be waiting. Good night! Baron! -- After you, boy! --Thanks, sir! Do you know who was at the old dummy's house? You idiot! Carter was there! Why am I paying your spies? Why? I'll take the cost of this stick out of your pay! See you later, Miss! --See you, Nick - on Friday; you promised! We'll have strawberry dumplings! --The sweetest strawberies are your lips! You may pick them, Nick! Kvetus, come and rub my back! Bye, Nick!... When you've squeezed that swelling back in, I'll tell you who I've seen here. If I only knew whether that rat recognized me... It he did then he clearly wants to take protect my victim! You must act fast! --Murder him, sir? No! You'll deliver him alive! I want to feed! --Feed? Where,sir? On his torment, you bum! Who does the Baron remind me of? Nice Baron! When he thinks no-one can see him he's as rude as an old criminal! --A criminal? Our savation! -- What's that? --The Criminal Bible! An album of international crooks. Get out! Am I disturbing you? --Not at all! Pardon! No! That's impossible! After all... Yet, it is him! -- Who? The Gardener! The most mysterious criminal of this century. His true identity and early life are veiled in mystery. "The Gardener" is a nickname he acquired for his botanical experiments. Commissar! He appeared out of the Amazonian jungle where he'd lived with the local Indians. On the picture he's apparently marked by a cross. The local shaman introduced him to a sacred carnivourous plant the locals used to sacrifice the hearts of their captive enemies. When it got sick and lost its appetite... he cured it by a jelly he made of the shaman and he became his successor. Later on, in the USA, he grew a fast-sprouting bean and would use it to get lifted to apartment windows so he could rob them. In California he married a widow of an Apple King and then got involved in fruit growing. The result of his experiments? So called heavy-duty granny smith! And also... universal heritage! He put asleep the famous tragedist actress Bara Sernarova by a thorn from a special rose. Probably on a table. But just for the case he ravished her immediately. Terrible... And is this rose available on the market? No. Thank god, it's not! All these plants have been the secret of his devilish glasshouse! Of course only I could stopped his rampage! I myself surrounded him and pushed him to a swamp, where he ended his miserable life. Or so I have believed... Till last night, when we stood face to face. No doubt, it's him who smuggled into the bedroom of Lady Tuna the outrageous carnivourous plant which devoured her beloved dog. Which concludes the case of Gert, the dog. Congratulations! --Just a moment! The best comes last. Commissar! - Observe well! Look at that - Baron Kraztmar! Oh no! Are you trying to say that... Yes! Baron Kratzmar and The Gardener are one and the same person! A close friend of Lady Tunova, a scientist, philantropist? Impossible! You've said yourself The Gardener drowned! I must have been wrong then! Then? Perhaps you are mistaken now, too! Mr Carter, we are all fallible. Excuse me. I'm expected at an execution! Not my own, of course! Good-bye! Just a moment! This is a sensitive case! May I expect your co-operation? Mr Carter, you work alone, don't you? -I respect.... Respect... respe... You flirt!...Good-bye! Watch out for bombs! What ye have there? --A present from my friend Roentgen. A ticket! Interesting! Commissar! We're off! --Where to? To the night club! --Always on guard! And now, the secret of Night Prague! An artiste incognito! Yes! Irma la Chat! Yes! Yes, yes! Irma the Cat! This is Virgin! [tails] This is... -- Eagle! [heads] - This is Eagle! Invited to the artiste's change room. Act as per instructions! Yes! Yes! --Virgin's disconnecting! Transmission finished. Very interesting! You've written these words to me: "Do you know what you don't know?" What do you know that I don't know? This! Miss Karyn! Yes. --So you are living two lives? Just two? A cat has seven lives, don't you know? Thanks. A detective must keep a clear head. You have that...and not just clear... but also classically perfect head! But...my reputation... I mean - your reputation! I don't care! --- No! -- Yes! Prove that you're a man! Or aren't you? Excuse me! -- And what about this? Or... Now you can throw yourself at me... --Yes!! So that's it!... You fell in your own trap! -- You dog! We'll get to the dog, too! First, tell me how the carnivourous plant found itself in the Lady's bedroom. --I know nothing! Perhaps you do. --Such as puzzel, ya got to be rough! A gentleman treats a woman as a lady, Commissar! --As you wish! Damn! --Well? Who brought the monster to the bedroom? For God's sake, don't! It's from Paris! I did. I brought it inside. And Baron Kratzmar gave it to you, didn't he? Yes. --And why? --So he could use Gert as an experiment with Adela. Adela? That's what he called the plant. And what experiment? --He cultivated Adela so its... ...its carnivourous abilities multiply by to Mozart's lullaby. Poor Mozart! And why did he select Gert? --Because... Because what? --I don't know. Thank you! Well? Hold on! Because... The dog was the size of a human. So this was just a rehearsal... The next victim -or rather the next lunch... is to be a person, isn't it? --Yes! Do you know who? -- Yes. So, who is it? -- OK... It's... --You traitor! Hands up! Please, as you wish! And fast! Armour! --So we're finished! No we aren't! A present from my friend Alfred Nobel. Thanks very much! Get down! Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Damn strong tobacco...! Hands up! Or I'll shoot, again! --Excuse me! Good evening, Kvetuska! --Nick! What are you doing here? Friend and I are playing Cops & Robbers. Playing in sewage pipes? You men! Sometimes you are like larky kids! I must run. Before the beer gets flat; Grandpa would tell me off. Good night! So - at 12 o'clock, strawberry dumplings. Byes! Byes! --Byes! Always on guard! What are we to do in the cupboard? I'll suffocate here! It's necessary. There are too many ears and eyes around us! Here there's too much naphtaline! --Commissar, we're going to attack! First I'll take a look at the Baron's. Ye get your funreal notice printed! Not necessary. If he is sure that I'm here, he won't be expecting me there. You're going to split in half? --Sort of. You'll be the first half. I'd rather stay in one piece. But you will. Only not as Commissar Ledvina. What's that funny rag? --Work clothes. This? Once more: Once I leave, what you will do? I'll make myself visible by the window, so it appears you're still here. Correct! It's not safe for you outside, Mr Carter! See you later! -- Yeah, I hope so! Would you happen to have a match? You're under arrest, Gardener! Hi, Robert! So you're the most mysterious criminal of the century! Franz, you know everything, don't you? --Not me, Mr Carter! We've got him, sir! In a barrel! It's about time! I won't charge you that broken stick. Ah, that's our Diogenes! Open it! -- Yes, sir! You won't stop the vehicle of my revenge now, you coward! What to do with him, sir? Adela hasn't had her dinner yet! --Let her work on her appetite! Tomorrow she'll have two courses for lunch! Carter will be the second one! The second one? -- And what about the Miss, sir? She's yours! --Thank you, sir! I'll prepare such fate for her, worse than death for a honourable women! And then I'll sell her to a South American bordello! That's it! Sweet dreams, sniffing bastard! Come sir, an injured thumb must be fixed right away, sir! If we rub a ebonite rod with a fox tail, student Carter... You don't fancy whiping by electricity, little one... I'm to be the second... but who's first course? No; I'll strike at the right time. A bit of patience, buddy! That'll be some day tomorrow! No way I can eat strawberry dumplings... ♪ Sleep my little prince sleep ♪ ♪ the birds and the lambs watch will keep ♪ ♪ silent each flower and tree ♪ ♪ hushed is the hum of the bee ♪ ♪ see the moon's silvery rays ♪ Good evening! Welcome, Nick! You look like you're coming straight from a magician's performance! Yes. And sorry I'm coming through the window. That's the American way of life! Sit down! Thank you. Alas, my attire makes it impossible to sit comfortably. You can speak loudly; Grandpa won't wake now. I came to apologize. I can't have dumplings tomorrow. You must. You are not going to spoil Grandpa's big day! Big day? The Baron's invited him to his palace. He promised to show him plant that having lunch. Grandpa... ---...will be the first course! Beg your pardon? --Nothing. Go on. Grandpa's looking forward to it. And me too -the nice Mr Baron's invited me, too! South American bordello... I will come to have some dumplings, Kvetuska.

You can drink from the bottle. --Thank you, sir! Sir! Before Adela shows what it can do, let's have a refreshing cup of tea. Sit down, please. Would Miss like some sweet dreams? --Oh yes! I'll suggest a cup of tea from mysterious Tibet. Sweet visions are a reward for its sour taste. And my colleague? Ceylon, Chinese...? ..Indian, Darjeeling... --Do you have rosebud tea? No? I'll leave it up to you then. Help yourselves to sugar! My Rose Kratzmarentzis is not yet able to do such precise tasks. Epochal! --Just a joke! Let's not get our tea go cold. Excuse me, dear colleague, but how did you manage to achieve such amazing results? How? Oh my god! What am I seeing? A report card from Jindrichuv Hradec gymnasium! A school I taught at in my youth! Do you know that the school was attended by a student who would not recognize a pistil of Supatka Jeleni from its carpel? No!-- You let him fail! --I did the right thing, then! Poor student! Everyone laughed at him! Everyone! Even Fanynka Mrchackova. Do you remember her? Rather voluptuous, she used to carry taxidermy to your study. Those were the days! The poor boy swore to wreak revenge using your own weapons! Not only was he studying botany madly he even became a criminal, to obtain the means for his expensive experiments! OMG what a hard job that was! Keep calm, colleague! And what was the student's name? Matej Kracmera? I don't remember! Then look at me! You are?...--Yes! Baron Robert von Kratzmar - the failed student Kracmera! The time of revenge has come, geezer! Here - you can eat the Fail mark! And be quick - Adela's hungry! You'll be in good company there! Adelai de Kratzmarie Keep chewing! Enjoy! Always on guard! The game's over, Gardener! You perfidious snooper! But what devil saved you from the swamp? What one? This one! The surface had closed over me, when I felt the firm bottom below. Just the tiny opening of this smoking utensil kept my contact with life! It was a fragile connection, but it allowed me to hang onto life. And this will ensure the handman's hope for you! I'm giving you a raise! --Should I ravish her now or later, sir?

You'll see it up close soon! But it's gonna be tough! How're you doing? Thank you - so far so good! Remember, Commissar: To admit one's defeat is also a victory of a kind. So in fact we've won! Ten of ten! That's impossible. Ye see what see? Stay calm, Commissar! Always ready! What's that? --A solar rifle. A present from my friend Laser. A test run first. Even the heavens are against us! So what's new? A present from my friend Messer. [German for knife] Ruppert! --Yes... Mr Carter! No doubt you're coming to congratulate me! Thank you! Mr Carter! Gert, meet America's most famous detective! Director, introduce him to the gentleman. Mr Carter! A message from Egypt, sir. Urgent! The Great Pyramid...disappeared? When's the next Orient Express departing? There is no other way, Kvetuska! The Great Pyramid's calling me and it's not interested in what my heart says. I understand, Nick. Only you can solve the mystery of the pyramide. Commissar! You can still make the decision! It's kind of you, but what would I do in Egypt? Maybe they have Pilsen beer, but I'm sure they don't know how to tap it. Professor! I'll never forget your dandelion wine! Thank you, thank you... And if you ever meet Ladislav Matejka in America...
