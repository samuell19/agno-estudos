Ah, that is a bird. What do you think? Do you see them? But look at all those ducks. Can you hear the duck now? How many do you see? How many do you see? Four? Yes... - -Oh. Hello? Hi, Mom. Yeah, no. We're at the park. No, I told you we weren't gonna be there on Friday. It's already Thursday. Because we have plans on Friday, Mom. I told you that. Okay. All right. I'll call you later. I have to go. All right. Bye. Hey! Hey! Stop him! Stop! Stop him! Stop! He has my baby! He has my baby. Wait! Stop! Stop him! ...by this weekend, he said he was gonna come with me after the party, so you know, I got dressed, I got excited because I was, like, you know, he's gonna pick me up, like... -Hey! -Hey. -Hey, Daphne. Hi. -Hey, Sophie. But, um, he never came. And then... Calvin, please. What up? My name's Calvin Pike. I was born in October and, uh, my favorite animal's my dog. You, in the next row. Well, it's your turn. My name's Aubrey. My birthday is in September. And my favorite animal is a hippopotamus. Are you okay? Yes, yes. Um, well, thank you, Aubrey. Uh, you may have a seat. - Hello? - Christina. I know you're gonna think I'm crazy, but... But what? I just saw Elizabeth. You what? There's a girl in my class that looks just like you when you were fifteen. Oh, my God. It's her, Christina. I just know it's your daughter. It's her. Oh, my God. Can you believe this? It's her. You don't understand. -Sweetheart, we-we do... -No, you don't! If you guys really cared about me, you wouldn't make me go to school. Don't talk to your mother that way. It might be easy for you two, but I'm not good at school. And of all subjects, math definitely doesn't come easy to me. Okay, well, you have no choice. You gotta go to school. Please, Mom, will you explain to him that if I go to school, I'm just gonna fail the test? I need more time to study. Hey, don't play your mom and I against each other. -I'm not. -Yes, you are. You always do. Please, Dad, I don't understand anything in that class. It's like everything that Mrs. Brent says, it's like another language to me. -I can't fail again. -No, you're right. -You can't fail again. -So? So if you fail the test, you face the consequences. -Consequences? -Richard... You'll be grounded again. But you're setting me up for failure because I'm telling you that I can't pass the test! Well, then you're gonna learn the hard way that you should've been studying while you're on social media and watching TV and hanging with your friends. But I can study all day long, but it doesn't matter if I don't understand what I'm studying. Please, Mom, help me out here. I'm sorry, but, your father and I, we're-we're together on this, okay? Go to school and just try your best, honey. And if you fail, it's... - We'll figure it out, okay? - It's gonna be fine. It's not gonna be fine, Mom. I'm pleading with you guys, please. I don't have any more time to discuss this because I need to get to work. Bye. And you need to start making some smarter choices. -Richard. -What? It's true. Dad, come on. He's a monster. I don't know how you married him. He's, he's not a monster, okay? He's just... all about tough love. That's not love. He's always been that way to me. Why does he have to be such a jerk? Oh, he's not. He's not. I, I promise. Well, he is to me. And I'm his blood. I mean, I just, I don't get it. Do you, uh... You don't think I'm a jerk, do ya? No, Mom, you're the best. -I know you love me. -Okay, good. 'Cause, honestly, I love you more than anything. Mm... Even puppies? Mm... Mm... Shh... -Oh, I love you. -Oh, honey, I love you. Okay, go. You gotta go to school. -You're gonna be late. -Like it matters. That's not funny, Travis. Oh, stop being so serious. -Lighten up. -I can't lighten up. I have this math test this morning I'm gonna fail. So? I failed all of my classes. That's why I don't go to school anymore. Well, if I fail, my dad's gonna ground me again. Your dad has always been such a jerk. - What's his deal? - I don't know. And he's such a stress case. Honestly, I don't know what my mom sees in him. You want me to kill him? Seriously? No. You really think I wanna go to jail? You know, for a moment, I thought you actually might want me to kill him. Well, sometimes I actually hate him that much. I mean, he treats me like I'm not even his daughter. Who does that? Both of my parents. That's who. That sucks. Yeah, it's cool. I kinda deserve it. Anyway, you want a ride to school or what? -Sure. -Hop in. Come on, Aubs. I don't even have to make this turn. Let's just go straight to the beach. No, no, no, turn right now. Travis, I need to take this test. - Come on. - Fine. You're such a goody two-shoes. I'll drop you off, but I'm picking you up after school. - Got it? - Okay, fine. -Thanks for driving me. -Mm-hmm. Come on, why don't we go to the beach or something? I can't. Even though I'm gonna fail, I still have to take the test. If you're gonna fail, you don't have to actually take the test. It's a fail either way. You do have a point. -What are you doing? -I'm smelling you. -You smell good. -You're creeping me out. Come on, Aubs. We've known each other since the second grade. Don't you think it's time for our relationship to go to the next level? What? What? Why are you laughing? Uh, no. I don't think so. -Thanks for the ride. -Hey, you're missing out. Mm-hmm. I'll pick you up after school. Don't be late. Oh, no. All right, everyone. You will have 45 minutes to take your test. Eyes on your own page, no peeking. - Put the book away. - Okay, then. And if you have any questions, anyone, please raise your hands. Speak quietly not to disturb anyone. Well, it's nice of you to join us, Ms. Williams. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Brent. I was studying all morning and I just, I lost track of time. Yeah, well, unfortunately, now you have five minutes less time to take your test. I know. But does it really matter? Uh, what was that? Excuse me? Nothing. Okay. You guys look so excited. Thank you. Thank you. Aubrey, it's time to turn in your test now. Aubrey? Hey, stop crying. What's going on over here? I couldn't even answer one question. I mean, this math makes no sense to me. I don't even know where to start. But you're in my classroom every day, Aubrey, yet you never ask any questions. I don't ask questions because I don't know what to ask. I mean, I feel like you're some astrophysicist and I'm just a complete idiot. You're not an idiot, Aubrey. You're a very smart girl. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm not teaching you in a way that your brain processes information. Huh. I never thought of it that way. I mean, and I don't have a problem with admitting that maybe this isn't the right environment for you. -Really? -Yeah, Aubrey. Not everyone is cut out to be in a class of 25 students with a teacher droning on at the chalk board. You don't drone, Mrs. Brent. Well, thank you, Aubrey, but I'm fully aware of what I sound like. And don't think I don't know what you kids say about me. -You do? -Come on, Aubrey. I am not oblivious to the world around me. Well, listen, I have a colleague, Tamara Thompson. She is an excellent tutor. She really has a way of connecting with the students and teaching them in a way that makes sense to them individually. -Really? -Yup. Um, but I don't think my parents will pay for a tutor. Oh, they don't have to pay for a thing. It's subsidized by the school system. -It is? -Yup. I mean... This program has been around for years, but very few students take advantage of it. So, I'm gonna call your parents and we're gonna get this going. You're a smart girl and I know you can do well in math. -How's that sound? -That sounds great. Okay. Thank you so much, Mrs. Brent. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate you, Aubrey. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Here you go. -Okay. -Have a good day. -You, too. Hang in there. Now listen to me, you two have to get your act together. This is the research on the Robinson case? This is mediocre at best. I go into the court room with this, I crash and burn. You understand? -Yes, I do. -I need to go. -Fix it. -So how... What is it, Beth? It better be important. Don't talk to me like that, Richard, please. I'm sorry, it's just... It's been really stressful in the office lately. Honey, it's been stressful for the past ten years. Maybe it's time to think about whether it's the office or you that has the issue. You're right, Beth, you're right. It's probably me. - Anyway, what's going on? - It's Aubrey. Oh, she failed the math test, didn't she? Now we have to come up with a new punishment? I'm tellin' you, I'm getting so tired of this, Beth. So tired. Richard, just calm down, okay? Yes, she failed the test. But I got a call from her teacher, Mrs. Brent, and she suggested that we get Aubrey a tutor. And I, I think that's a great idea. Great. Great. How much is that gonna cost? Does it even matter what it costs? I mean, she's your daughter, you should be doing whatever it takes to get her help. Right. I certainly don't wanna still be paying for her when she's in her twenties, that's all. Anyway, the tutor is subsidized by the school, so it's... It doesn't cost a thing. -Well, that's nice. -Look, she's, uh... She's coming here tonight at 6:00. And, uh, I want you to be here to meet her, okay? W-wait, I, I'd have to leave the office by 5:00. Listen, Aub-Aubrey is your daughter. Okay? I need you to be here. And if you're not... don't even bother coming home. -Really? -Yes. Really. I'm, I'm so sick of your attitude towards Aubrey. You-you need to start showing her that-that you care. And being home to meet her tutor, that's, that's showing that I care? Yeah. I think it's a start. Yeah. Okay. See you at 6:00. Thank you. -Goodbye. -Bye. So, uh, you're going to the party on Friday night? Uh, yeah, sure. Why not? Cool. How about if I pick you up at your house? Absolutely not. My father would never let you pick me up. Fine, I'll pick you up around the corner. Yeah. What the hell? - What? - This dude's tailgating me. Well, just ignore him. Yeah, how can I ignore him when he's riding me like this? Please, just focus on what's in front of you. Maybe I should slam on my brakes and teach him a lesson. Yeah, and get us killed? Okay. What the hell? Do you know this guy? Have you seen this car before? No. I'm gonna give this dude a piece of my mind. No, no, no, that's dangerous. He could have a gun. -Yeah, I don't care. -Please, don't. Fine. Be careful. You're driving like a maniac. You could've killed us. Yeah, but I didn't. You're crazy. You know that? Yeah, but you like it. No, I don't. Whatever. So I'll pick you up Friday night? Yeah, sure. How about 9:00 p.m.? Yeah, that works. I'll meet you here, though. Don't pull up to my house. Got it? Yeah, I got it. Hi, Mom. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be home in five. I'm just around the corner. O-okay, I'm coming. Okay, love you, bye. -Aubs... -I gotta go. -Come on. -I'll see you later, okay? Okay, I guess. -Bye. -Bye. Where have you been? I came home early for this meeting. I'm sorry, I didn't know there was a meeting. What's going on? Hi, honey, this is Tamara Thompson. -She's-she's your new... -Tutor. Uh, hi. Nice to meet you. Mrs. Brent told me about you. Hi, Aubrey, it's, it's so nice to meet you, too. So not to be rude, but, uh, why are you here? Well, that is rude. Please. Mrs. Thompson is here to start your math lessons. Oh, Tamara, please. Mrs. Thompson's a little formal for tutoring. -Start my tutoring? Now? -Right now. Yeah. It's as good a time as any, isn't it? But I was gonna hang out with Julia tonight. On a school night? No. -I don't think so. -Dad... Really, are you gonna embarrass your mother and I in front of your new tutor? Honey, honey, Tamara cleared her whole schedule just so she can be here tonight, okay? So if you just... A bit shocking to come home from school and be expected to work with a tutor with no notice. Okay. Aubrey, I understand. I get it, I do. The first lesson, well, it's not really about work. We're just gonna get an idea of what concepts you understand and which ones you don't. We'll actually have a little bit of fun. Nothing about math is fun to me, so... It's not funny. It's really not. It's all right. Why don't you go rest for a couple of minutes? Get something to eat and then we'll start to work, okay? That sounds... good. Thanks. Thank you, Tamara. I'm sorry about her behavior. It won't happen again. I would be surprised if it didn't happen again. She's a teenager. I mean, her neurons aren't connected, her hormones are raging... I mean, she can't help herself. That's why it's imperative for us as adults to be patient. Do you have children? Yes. I have a daughter. She's about Aubrey's age. I think she, uh, actually likes the way she's teaching her. -And that's amazing. -Well, I certainly hope so. Hey, hey, have some faith, okay? She is a very smart girl, like her mama. Well, like her mama, and Lex Luthor. She uses her brains for no good. Oh, hey. Hey. Come on, let's go spy. Let's have fun. Come on. Okay, so stop thinking of algebra as math. Right, um, think of it as a puzzle and you're always trying to find how much X is. Not to be rude, but I hate puzzles. I'm sure you liked them when you were a little girl. No, no, I did, I did. I'm just... I'm just a little lost here. Okay, all right. Let me, um... Let me think of a better way to phrase this. Thanks, Tamara, I-I've never seen Aubrey laugh and do math at the same time. - So that was impressive. - It's my pleasure. Young kids just need a different way to look at things, that's all. They certainly do. Mr. Williams, you should really be more patient with Aubrey. If you trust her, she'll surprise you. Anyway, I wanna see her three times a week for the next two weeks and then we can drop it off to two. All right. How's that sound, Aubs? Okay? Yeah, yeah. That's... good. Hm. Okay, I'll see you in a couple of days. - Thanks, Tamara. - Have a good night. - Bye-bye. - Drive safely. Yes, you can do your own taxes. Uh, yes, but you can become a CPA, a meteorologist... You can use math in your life allowance. So if Y equals MX plus B, B is for what? Something like that, right? You're coming tonight, right? How am I supposed to come? It's like I'm in prison in here. They watch me like a hawk. It's gonna be the best party of the year. You can't miss it. Uh, I can't ask my parents again. They already said no. Then don't ask. Just sneak out. I can't do that! Of course, you can. When was the last time your parents checked up on you after you went to bed? I guess they stopped after I turned 13. Exactly. Look, I'll see you later. Wear something cute, okay? Gotta go. Bye. Uh, Julia, come on, wait! - Hey. - Hey. After you. Aubrey... Really? Do you know where the party is? Of course. It's at Jake's house. But I've got other plans for us. -You do? -Yup. Get in. Uh, Travis, why are we at the beach? I thought we're going to Jake's house. Well, the party doesn't start till dark, and sunset's beautiful and you're looking great. Well, I'm not dressed for the beach. -I'm dressed for a party. -Come on. It's romantic, isn't it? Sure. I mean, I guess. Not in second grade anymore. Mm... But I liked you in second grade. Travis, stop it. Travis, stop! Why? It's making out. Trying to touch me everywhere is not making out. -It's a part of it. -No, it's not. Come on, Aubrey. I know you want me. No! I definitely don't want you now. Why? Because you're acting like a creep. How does making out turn me into a creep? When you push it too far! Calm down. Don't you know anything about girls? Stop! What the hell? That's the same car! What's going on? How did he find us here? Hey. Hey, hey, hey... Where, where are you going? We're done. We didn't even start. -Thank God. -Aubrey. You can't walk down the whole PCH highway by yourself. Why not? Huh? Can't be another molester around. That's just too much of a coincidence. -Aubrey, I'm not molesting you! -Thanks for ruining my night. Dumbass. Hey, you. What are you doing out here? You havin' a rough night? No, no, not really. I'm fine. -You need a ride? -No, no. I'm good. Thanks. Um, do your parents know you're walkin' around out here dressed like that? I didn't think so. Look, I appreciate that you stopped. But, but really, I'm-I'm good. Hey, why don't you just let me take you home, Aubrey? Thanks, but I'm not going home. I have plans. Look, a-as soon as I get reception, I'll just, I'll take a rideshare, okay? Okay, well, why don't you let me take you to the party? - Huh? - Come on. You're obviously going to the party, right? Why don't you let me take you there? You'd do that for me? Sure. Why not? I just figured you'd take me home and then tell my parents. Well, I'm your math tutor, not your parent, right? So I'm not gonna tell your parents. -Really? -Really. -Get in. -Okay. Thank you. Ah. Thank you. So are his parents gonna be there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure they're home. Come on, Aubrey. His parents aren't home. He probably throws one of these parties every time they leave town. Yeah, you're probably right about that. Listen, do me a favor and behave yourself tonight. You don't have to smoke or drink or do drugs or have sex. Just have fun with your friends, okay? I thought you said you were my tutor, not my parent. Yeah, well, I still care about you. Well... thanks again for the ride. It was really nice of you. Yeah, and, um, just keep it our little secret, okay? Yeah, definitely. Oh. Tomorrow I am completely free and I'm gonna go to Santa Monica Pier, riding the roller coaster, playing games, having some fun. Would you wanna join me? I mean, you know, if you don't have plans with your other girlfriends or anything like that. I mean, I'm sure your parents wouldn't mind. Yeah. Sure, that sounds like a lot of fun. -Yeah? -Yeah. All right, um, I'll pick you up at noon. You'll probably wanna sleep in after tonight. Yeah. That sounds great. All right. Well, be safe. Thanks, Tamara. This was so much fun. Thank you. I can't believe you never come here. My parents don't really get out much. Yeah, I don't get that. I mean, don't they take you places? They don't really focus a lot of their time on me. I mean, my mom tries, but my dad just shuts her down every time. He doesn't really like me very much. No, that's not true. Yeah, it is. Trust me. He treats me like I'm a nuisance or something. I mean, if it weren't for my mom, he probably would've just dumped me off the side of the road somewhere. What? Aubrey! I don't know. Maybe he wanted a boy. How did your parents meet? Well, I don't know if you know this, but, uh, Beth is actually my stepmom. They met when I was six years old. I don't know why or how she fell for him, but I'm honestly really glad that she did because the first six years of my life were terrible. He hated me. I mean, thankfully, she got him to stop abusing me, but he never treated me like a real father should. Okay, wait a minute. He abused you? Emotional or physical? Both, but I don't really remember much. I've kind of blocked a lot of it out. How could he do that to a child? I don't know. You tell me. Do you mind if I ask about your real mother? Well, the thing is, I don't know much about my real mom. My dad said that she died when I was three, but who knows, maybe he killed her. I'm not kidding. He's so volatile that sometimes I feel like he could even kill me. He definitely has it in him. Okay, that's frightening. And you sleep there every night? Yeah, but I keep a gun under my bed. What? Okay, who gave you a gun? -My mother did. -Okay. That's the most insane thing that I've ever heard. Well, that's pretty much my life in a nutshell. Aubrey, I am so sorry. You don't deserve any of this. No girl does. You are so amazing. Do you know that? I just wanna squeeze you and take you home with me. Why are you so nice to me? Because I was just like you once. Really? We have a lot in common. -You hungry? -Yeah. -Bye, Mom. -Bye, honey. -Good luck. -Bye. Tamara's driving her to school? Yeah. Isn't it sweet? I mean... They seem to really get along. She's great. I don't think that's healthy. What? Why? I mean, she's her tutor. She's not her friend. Oh. It's... Come on, it's ridiculous. -Why can't she be both? -She's a grown woman. Why does she hang out with a child? I hate to break it to you. Your daughter's not a child anymore. She's gonna be 16 soon. And, second, Tamara's a really good influence on her. What's the alternative, I mean, she's hanging out with a bunch of bad kids from school or an intelligent woman? I mean, who says she's intelligent? -What is that supposed to mean? -I mean, she's a math tutor. She's not a lawyer or a doctor. I'm not impressed. You can be such an ass. Well, thanks for driving me. I really appreciate it. I'm so proud of you, Aubrey. I think you're gonna do amazing on this test. It was all you. You really helped me a lot. Thank you. I hope you know how much this time has meant to me. Getting to know you and spend time with you has meant more to me than you can imagine. Well, I, uh, feel the same. Um, I'll text you after the test and let you know how it goes, okay? Yeah. I'll be waiting, so, um, don't forget. I won't. I love you. Uh, love you. Did you take a rideshare to school today? -No. -Then who dropped you off? That was my math tutor. Your math tutor drove you to school? Yeah. -Why is that? -It's a little weird. It's not weird at all. In fact, she's an amazing person. I really like her. Yeah, well, you have other friends, too, you know? Wow! Jealous much? I tried to call you all day on Saturday and you didn't call me back. I'm sorry. I was with Tamara at the Santa Monica Pier. We had so much fun. I'm sure you did. Why is she still watching us? I-I don't know, she's just making sure I'm getting into school okay. What are you, five years old? No. She just cares about me. Yeah, sure, whatever. Why don't you give me a call when you feel like being my friend again? Are you all right, Aubrey? -Yes. I'm done. -Very good. Then put your test in the basket on the desk. -Aubrey! -I was just calling you! So how'd it go? I think I aced it. Really? Oh, I'm so proud of you. Hey, I couldn't wait. I graded the test. And? You got hundred percent! - Oh! - What? No way! I got all the problems right? You certainly did, young lady. You two make a good team. Well, Tamara is the best teacher I've ever had. I mean, no offense to you, Mrs. Brent. Well, none taken. I know what you mean, Aubrey. We should celebrate after school. -Sure. -Okay. -I'll pick you up out front. -Okay. Now, young lady, you need to get to your next class. Thank you. Well done. - Where have you been? - I've been studying. I want to finish what we started. What you started. Whatever. I know you want me. -Just admit it. -No. I don't. My ride's here. I gotta go. Fine. Yeah, I'll see you around. So who's that boy? - He's... - Just a friend. But he wants something more. Okay, well, you don't have time for him. And you certainly don't have time for a high-school drop-out. Right? Education is your priority. Right. You like classic rock? Uh, sure, I guess. I mean, I don't really listen to it that much. Well, by the end of the day, you're gonna know everyone from Zeppelin to the Eagles to the Stones. -The who? -Yes, them, too. So where are we goin'? We are gonna go get take-out from my favorite restaurant in LA. - Where is that? - It's on Sunset. It's a Mediterranean restaurant and it serves the best falafels. Falaf-what? Oh, my God. Okay. Do you like garbanzo beans? Uh, sure. I guess. Okay, well, a falafel is a whole bunch of garbanzo beans smashed up and then they deep fry it. And it's delicious. Okay. Well, I'm trusting you. Don't you think you can trust me by now? I think I trust you more than anyone in my life right now. - This is so good. - Yeah. So this is hummus and that's falafel. And they're both made with garbanzo beans. Wow! I didn't know you could do so much with garbanzo beans. Do you mind? It's Julia. -She's sort of mad at me. -Sure, go ahead. Hello? -Hey, did you hear the news? -What news? Travis just crashed his car racing on Sunset Boulevard. - What? Really? - He's in the hospital. I mean, your social media should be blowing up about it. They think the guy he was racing pushed him off the road. Oh, my God! Travis crashed his car. He got in a terrible accident. Look, I'm really sorry, Aubrey. I know you and Travis were dating. No. No, we weren't dating. In fact, we were, we were in a fight. He came on to me last week and I just, I left him. Sorry. Anyway, I-I thought you should know. Thanks for letting me know. -Why are you crying? -Because he was my friend. No, Aubrey, he was not your friend. Who knows what would've happened that day if I didn't show up. He could've raped you. What are you talking about? He, he was with me, but I didn't tell you that he was with me. Well, I just assumed that that's where you were and that's who you were with. Look... I'm sorry about Travis, but you have to stop thinking about him. He's bad news. You have to focus on other things. -Okay. -Come on, eat a falafel. That'll make you feel better. Okay, if you say so. I'll have that one. So M is the slope. P is the Y-intercept. This is the X-axis and this here is the Y-axis. So... two... If you plug in Y for two, then that's one XM plus zero. So two is M plus zero. So the slope two is M. -Does that make sense? -Very good, Aubrey. You've really gotten a grasp on this algebra now. Pretty good. Aubrey was failing this class and now she's getting an A. And if Aubrey can do it, you can do it. Thank you, Ms. Aubrey. You may take a seat. Teacher's pet. -Really? -Hm. I turn my grade from an F to an A and now I'm a teacher's pet? Maybe if you put some more effort into your studying, you would do better. Yes. I have your research on that woman you asked me to check out. That's great, April. Thank you. Please, come in. Have a seat. I've got a lot of interesting information for you. First of all, her name is not Tamara Thompson. Her real name is Christina Miller. She's from San Francisco. Interestingly enough, she has no teaching credentials. I mean, not that I could find. She went to San Francisco State. She has a degree in Fine Arts. Okay. None of that's too shocking. Here's the interesting stuff. About thirteen years ago, her daughter was abducted. And they never found her. Here's the doozy. She was arrested for trying to break in to a detective office in a police station. Looks like she was trying to acquire the records from her daughter's abduction. Did she get them? My information's not that detailed. But I would think that if she had, she would've been charged with a lot more than stealing. I mean, breaking in to a police station has to be a big deal. So she seems to have no trouble breaking the law. It's clear that this woman has had a rough road, but I don't think she's somebody you want your daughter spending time with. Here you go. Let me know if you need anything else. Thank you, April. So... I guess if you multiply, then maybe 70 and 49... And that's the vector, right? Yes, you got it. Hey, everybody. How's the tutoring going? - Hey, Dad. Guess what? - What? I'm doing calculus now. That is so great. -Hey, honey, you feelin' okay? -Hi. -Yeah, I'm good. -Really? You're sweatin'. -No, I'm fine. Thank you. -You don't have a fever. -You're good. -Okay. Thank you. That's really good. -Really? -Yeah. Sure. Privately? -Yeah. -Why? I'll talk to you later, okay, sweetheart? Beth? Come on, honey. What? Why? I don't know. I'm sure it's fine, honey. Let them... -Just a second... -What's going on? Everything's fine, I'm sure. I know it's a bit more dramatic than I intended, but... What can I do for you, Mr. Williams? Well, Tamara, I know that you and my daughter have gotten very close. Like, it's gone quite a bit beyond your typical tutor-and-student relationship. Yeah, we, uh, we certainly have bonded. Right. Well, I don't like it. And why not? Because a 15-year-old girl does not need her tutor to be her friend. Aubrey has parents. We are the adult mentors in her life. And we are the only voices that she needs. Now, it's unfortunate, but it's time this relationship ends. What? I mean, uh, Aubrey, um, she's... She didn't even take her final exam yet. -She needs me. -It's okay. She gets the concepts. She'll be just fine without you. Mr. Williams, if you feel that I have overstepped my boundaries with Aubrey, uh, then I am sorry, okay? But please just let me continue to tutor her. A-and then I'll stay away from her. I-I really am only looking out for her best interest. Right. -So am I. -Mr. Williams... Look, there isn't anything you can say. Okay? I have made my decision. Made what decision? Your father is firing me. That isn't what I said. You said that I can't tutor Aubrey. And that's firing in my book. -What? -Well, what's going on? Dad fired Tamara. Wait, what? What? What the hell is wrong with him? Finally, something good happens in my life and you're just gonna push it away? Why do you hate me? What is wrong with you? You pack your things and leave our home. Girls, come here. Where are you? Beth, Aubrey, listen. Listen to me. She is not who she says she is. Why can't you just... I, I-I can't believe that you'd do this. And w-why would you do this without talking with me first? I didn't have time to explain things... What do you mean you didn't have time? Aubrey's your daughter. Tamara's been so nice to me, Dad, I've learned so much from her. I can't believe that you would do this without telling me. I just, I can't believe you're doing this. Aubrey, now just quiet, okay? She's literally changed Aubrey's life. She took her from an F to an A in math. She's a friend and a mentor to her. How can you do this? I had to do this. I had to. Why? Tamara's got a criminal record, Aubrey. How do you know that? We did a background check on her at the office. Look, she should have never been in this house in the first place, never. I'm gonna file a suit tomorrow morning. -With the school board. -Come on, that's insane! Whatever happened to being innocent until proven guilty? No, not when it comes to our daughter. Really? When have you started caring much about our daughter? I care about our daughter. I've cared about both of you. That's not true. You're a disgrace as a father. You should be ashamed of yourself. Ever since we met, you've treated Aubrey like a nuisance rather than a daughter. And I let it out, but, yes, but... you put me in the middle. But not anymore. I'm done. If you can't find any love or compassion in that cold heart of yours... I don't want to be with you. Beth. Okay, so what? So you're leaving now? No. You are. Get the hell out. And don't come back until you've actually become a human being. Aubrey, hey... Listen... Damn it! Tamara? Aubrey? Aubrey, I'm so sorry. I can't believe him. He's a disgusting human being. I can't even believe that he's my father. Don't cry. Everything's gonna be all right. What was he talking about? I have no idea. I need to get out of here. Can you pick me up? Yes. Of course. Can, can you get out without him seeing you? I'm really worried about you. Yeah. I think so. Oh, my God. He took my gun. My gun's missing. Aubrey, you need to get out of the house right now. Get some clothes, put them in a bag and meet me at the corner right now. Okay. I'm so sorry he treats you so badly. I am so sorry. Please, Tamara. Please, just take me away from here. I can't, I can't stand it here anymore. It's okay. I know it's terrible. I'm gonna take care of you. You're safe. She's gone, Richard. What did you do? No. She's in Tamara's car, Beth. I'm following 'em right now. Why? Why? What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna stop her. - No, no, no. No. Listen to me. You're just gonna cause an accident, okay? You just need to stop, okay? Just stop what you're doing. I don't understand how I became the bad guy here, Beth. I don't understand it. You've been treating Aubrey and I like garbage for the last, what, ten years? Really, is that so? Yeah, and you know it. You didn't marry me because you loved me. Let's be honest. You married me because you wanted somebody to take care of Aubrey. Am I right? No! No. I... Beth, how dare you say that to me? Do you really think that I'm that shallow? Yeah. I do. Good morning, sunshine. Are we, uh, are we close? Uh, we have about an hour left. You're gonna love it. It's such a different feeling from LA. I'm actually thinking about moving back there. -Oh, really? -Yeah. -I can't wait to meet your mom. -She's the best. She's, she's really a sweet lady. You'll love her. Wow! This is where your mom lives? Yup. My parents built it about 40 years ago. And your mom lives there all alone? Yeah, she's gonna be so happy she has visitors. There she is now. Hi, Mom! And you're gonna love her. Oh. Mom, this is Aubrey. Aubrey, this is my mother, Barbara. Oh. I'm so glad you're here finally. Well, it's, um, really nice to be here. Were you expecting me? I've been expecting you for a long time. What she means is, I called her last night and told her that you would be coming. So I've been waiting for you all night. Oh, oh, okay. The way you said it made it seem like you were waiting for years. Oh, she's exactly how I imagined she'd be. Well, let's get inside, it's chilly out here. - And I know Aubrey's hungry. - Oh, yes, of course. I made some breakfast for both of you. You must be very tired. I'm sure Tamara's exhausted. I slept pretty much the entire way. Oh, well, then fine. You and I can talk while Tamara's sleeping. - Richard? - Good morning, Beth. Aubrey didn't, didn't come home last night. And I'm, I'm-I'm worried sick. I know. I'm going to get her right now. Where? I believe Tamara took her to San Fran. I've got an address, so... Thank you. Okay, just, um... get there fast, okay? Beth... Look, I'm sorry, I... I promise you, I'm gonna try to take care of you and Aubrey better, okay? -I promise. -We'll figure everything out. -Okay? -Okay. I love you, Beth. And you've lived in the same house your entire life? Yeah, yeah, we-we moved in after my father and Beth got married. When you were six. Yes. And has Beth been a good stepmother to you? Yeah. Well, I don't really consider her my stepmother. I mean... she's my mom. I know we're not, like, blood related or anything, but... I don't really consider her that way. I love her very much. That's sweet. I'm glad that she could be there for you all these years. So am I. Because if, if I'd been raised alone by my father, I don't, I don't think I'd be alive right now. What? He has a terrible temper. Only my mother is able to keep him in check. S-so he's not nice to you? No. He really seems to resent me. I-I don't know quite what it is, but... he's definitely a man who should have never had a child. Do you think that, uh, your mother's worried about you right now? I'm sure she is, but she can't protect me from him. Thankfully, I have Tamara. Thankfully, I have you. Why are you two so emotional? Will you stay here for a second? I have something to show you. Sure. Um, but do you mind if I use the bathroom first? Oh. Of course, sweetie. Use the one t-that's right off the kitchen. -Thanks. -Okay. Do you, uh, think it's too soon? No, Mom, we have to tell her. It's time. - Aubrey. - Mom? Oh, thank God. Thank God. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I-I'm fine. Uh, I'm, I'm so sorry, Mom. I don't know what I'm doing. I realize I must have hurt you so much by leaving. Oh, honey. It's-it's-it's okay. Really, I... I love you so much, okay? Don't, don't worry about it. I understand. Okay? Look, your, um, your father, he's, he's on his way up there to get you. - He is? - Yeah, honey. He's been worried sick about you. -I don't believe that. -Well, okay, and you just... Let him get you out of there, okay? And then we can talk about everything else later, okay? Okay. Mom? Yeah, love? How does dad know where Tamara's mother lives? Your dad did a, uh, a background check on her... Again, we can talk, we can talk about this later, but it turns out that she's, uh, not as honest as we thought she was. - Really? - Yeah. Honey, look, just... Please, just get home safely, okay, just be safe. Okay. - I love you. - I love you. Hi, sweetie. We're in the dining room. Hi. Why don't you come and sit down? We have some things to show you. Sure. What is that? Aubrey, do you trust me? Okay, good, because we have some things to tell you that will shock you, but you need to know. Fifteen years ago, I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. And when she was two years old, I bundled her up and I put her in her stroller and I took her to a nearby park. And that day turned out to be the worst day of my entire life. Stop! He has my baby! He has my baby! And that was the last time I saw my baby girl. I'm so sorry. Was she your only child? Yes. And my husband, he, he was in so much pain... he couldn't handle it. And he left. That's terrible. This is a picture of my baby girl the day before she was abducted. She's beautiful. Yeah. And this is her birth certificate. Her name was Elizabeth. -It's a pretty name. -Yeah. She named her after my mother. And this, uh, is a picture of me when I was fifteen. Does it look familiar? She... You look like me. Fascinating, isn't it? I-I'm sorry. I... I-I don't understand. I'm-I'm a little confused. Do you remember the first time you were in Mrs. Brent's class? Mrs. Brent is my best friend from childhood. And she found you. But how do you know that for sure? Well, she was able to get a piece of your hair, and we did, uh, a DNA test. It says we have a 99.9% chance that we're mother and daughter. Oh, my God. You're my baby girl. So my father isn't Richard? Do you remember the man of my story? When he ran away with you, he looked back at me. And I'll never forget that face. It was Richard. My father abducted me? We believe that he kidnapped you because his wife couldn't have kids. Wow. What happened to his wife? We think she was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards. And, and my-my father... R-Richard probably married Beth so that he could have someone to take care of me. Maybe. Oh. Oh, my God. -What? -He's on his way here right now. -What? -What? How? I called my m... Beth. In the bathroom. And she said that he knew where you lived and he, he was already close. -Okay. -I-I, um, I'll call the police. Okay. It's okay. Uh, 911? Uh... Uh, yes, um, uh, there's an emergency here. We need, uh, you to come right away. Send the police, yes. Thank you. Okay, come on. Where's my daughter, Tamara? I'll take her upstairs. I'll hide her in the closet. Go away, Richard! Tamara, open the door. Leave now. I am not opening the door. - Go! - Open it. Tamara, where is my daughter? - She's not here! - You're lying to me. I saw her bag in your car. Richard, I called the police. Go away! You're kidding me, right? Christina Miller thinks I'm worried the cops are coming when you've just kidnapped my daughter? I... Uh, the police are on the way, Richard. Go! You better open the door now or I'm gonna knock it down. I'm not opening the door! Go! Open the door, Tamara! Open the door! Oh, my God! Stop it! - Stop! Stop! - Open the door! Give me my damn daughter! Aubrey? Aubrey? Where are you, Aubrey? I'm here. It's safe, okay? Where are you, honey? Aubrey? Aubrey, where are you, sweetheart? Aubrey, I'm here. You're safe. You're safe now, sweetie. Aubrey, you upstairs? Aubrey? Aubrey, are you upstairs, sweetheart? Where is she, Tamara? What did you do with her, Tamara? Aubrey? Aubrey, where are you, sweetheart? Where are you? No! Tamara! Aah! Tamara? Tamara, where is my daughter? She's not your daughter! Where is my daughter, Tamara? - Aubrey, no! - Stop! Please, don't do anything you'll regret. Well, I won't regret anything, sweetheart. There you are. Come. Don't you dare call me "sweetheart." Hey, what the hell is goin' on here? You know exactly what's going on. Stop playing stupid! -What did you tell her? -I told her everything. I told her the truth. She's lying to you, Aubrey. She's lying to you. No. No, she's not lying. Richard, you're insane. You can't trust these people, I'm telling you. Either one of them, you can't trust them. You abducted me! Does Beth even know what you've done? You have brainwashed my daughter. I'm not your daughter. She showed me proof. You kidnapped me from a park when I was two years old. How could you do that? For the last 13 years, all you've been for me is trouble. And all I've done is work to take care of you and your mother. My mother is standing right there. Where did she go? Tamara, where are you? Why does it matter? Huh? You were just gonna shoot her to keep your secret from getting out. Well, it's out. Okay? You can't hide anymore. You can't talk to me like that. -Back off! -I'm your father. You've never been my father. What would your mother think? You mean, the saint that you married? The woman who put up with your decade of abuse? You're disgusting! Go ahead. Shoot me. What's the difference? Sheriff's department. Put the gun down now. No! Hands behind your head. Do it now. - I said, now. - Okay. Okay. Uh, okay, all right. Two, three. Let's go. So... this is it. This is it. This is the last place I ever saw you. I can't even imagine how terrible that must've been for you. Words can't describe how much pain I was in. You know, I always had this... like, empty feeling in my heart, but... now I feel like it's full again. Oh... I love you so much. I love you. Aubrey. Hi! -Hello. -Hi. Thank you for taking such good care of my baby all these years. My pleasure. I... I-I love Aubrey like she's my own flesh and blood. Now I have two moms. Yes, you do, honey.
