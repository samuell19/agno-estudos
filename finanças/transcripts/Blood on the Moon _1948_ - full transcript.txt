Who's there? - Put a light on yourself. - With what? - Man, man, I didn't know anyone was here. - Well, I had a fire. Couldn't stopped them if I'd seen it. I don't think I've seen you around here before, have I? No. - You come over the peaks? - Yeah, with an outfit. - What you doing here? - Waiting for you to clear out of my camp. And I'm going to turn in if I can find my blanket. Our camp is just below, maybe you'd better come along. We can make it double that far. I guess I could do with a cup of coffee. Hey, it's me, Bart. - Who is he? - I don't know. I was bringing my gather down the creek when they cleaned out his camp. So I brought him along. - You come over the peaks? - That's right. Why didn't you come through the pass? No law says a man has to stay on a wagon road, is it? My men caught your horse, it's branded Lazy J. I don't know it. Don't you? Wait a minute Cap. You make a fellow feel right at home, don't you? Alright, my name is Lufton John Lufton. This is Cap Willis, my foreman. A month ago nobody would've asked you any questions. It's different now, who are you? Jim Garry, Lazy J is a Texas brand. - Heading for Sundust? - That's right. You know anybody there? No. Alright, I apologize for my steers. We'll replace your outfit, make yourself comfortable. Get him something to eat Joe. - Rotten night. - Yeah. Sorry, we'd to be so rough on you Garry, but you're a loose rider. We got to watch them these days. - A little argument over grazing land. - Oh? Yeah, for five years now, I've been supplying the beef... to feed the Indians here on the reservation. This year they got a new agent, fellow named Pindalest. He's rejected my beef and he's kicking me off the reservation grass. It doesn't explain about the loose riders. No, but I haven't got any graze to move to except... what I used to claim in the basin across the river. And there seems to be a little difference of opinion now as to who owns that. Me or the homesteaders they've been drifting in. I'm moving back. - They'll fight. - Yeah, I reckon they will. Newcomer moved in this summer, he's got them organized. Name is Riling. Still doesn't explain about the loose riders. He's bringing in gunmen. - Nobody can blame him for being careful. - I'm afraid you don't get it. - Get what? - This. - It's work for me or keep on riding. - And if I don't? I'll give you a day in Sundust and then you better drift. Sleep on it Garry. Much obliged for the outfit. - Working for me Garry? - No, I guess I'll be drift. Well, it's your choice. You mind dropping a note at Blockhouse with my womenfolk? That's my place over in the basin, it's on your way. Glad to. Thanks, good luck. Hold it, I'm riding through. Come on out and talk. You don't care who you kill, do you? Maybe that will cool you off. - Got a note from John Lufton. - I'm Carol Lufton. - You're working for us now? - No. Did Dad say when he was coming down from the reservation? - No ma'am. - Thank you. Stop right there. You're the man that shot me by the river. - Yeah, I guess I am. - Well, I'm going to show you how it feels. Put that gun down Amy. Amy, stop it, stop it, stop it. Stop it, you hear? - Have you gone crazy? - What's going on here? Ask him. I was giving back a little of what he gave me. - What about it? - She's right. Why is Dad had a guard at the river for a... week if it isn't to keep riders from crossing? - What you doing here? - He brought a note from Dad. Well, I tried to tell her, only she wouldn't give me the chance. Alright, you've delivered the note, now get out. Well, for once, you bit off more than you can chew. - That him? - Yeah. - What do you think? - Maybe. Maybe my foot, now you got to get hit in the head with it? - Lufton threatened to get one, didn't he? - Hey, you ain't sure it's him. I caught his sign going into Lufton's ranch this morning and I caught it going out. He's a stranger, ain't he? John Lufton has the right to hire a range detective if he wants to Milo. - Not to watch us he ain't. - Well, let Riling handle it and no shooting. Take the third stall, the boy will bring you some hay. Settlemeir, any idea who that fellow is? - Lazy J is the brand but I don't know it. - He say anything? - He asked where he could find Tate Riling. - Riling? Yeah. Yeah. - I'll take it at the table Barney. - Sure. - I'm raising. - I'll stay. Lufton's watcher just drifted in. - Cattle detective? - What else? He asked for Riling. - Riling? - Yeah. If he's Lufton's watcher, what do you figure he wants with Riling? Let's find out. - Yeah, why not? - But how? Riling ain't here. - Sure he is. - Where? Right here, eh Nels? Well, let's wait till Riling gets here. - We don't want to make no mistake. - Right Nels. Maybe you want the law to come in here and find out what we're planning to do. - So he can go back and tell Lufton. - Alright Milo alright. I'll tell Barney. - You know where I can find Tate Riling? - Back table. Ace, Queen Mitch. Tate Riling? Riling? That's me. - Like to talk to you. - Go ahead. These are my friends. I'm looking for a riding job. - Who said I was hiring riders? - I heard it. - Hear what I'm hiring them for? - Yeah, I heard that too. Why, yes. Dumb play boy. Back alley. He's headed for the street. It's Riling, Lufton's watcher is in town asking for you. And he wanted a riding job with us Tate. - Well, then go get him. - There he is. - Jim Garry. - Hello Tate. Why, this is Jim Garry the man I sent for, he's no range detective. What went wrong Jim? What happened? Who started this? Ask these jokers here Tate. If this is Garry, what's he doing up at Lufton's? - Lufton's? Were you up at Lufton's place? - Yeah, he was. I see him. That's right, I delivered a note to his womenfolk, what about it? Oh, it's Lufton's outfit it's trying to run us out of the country Jim. - Am I supposed to know that? - Why no, I forgot. I never wrote Jim about our fight with Lufton. I told him I needed him and asked him to come on up. Now, stop chewing leather, go get yourself a drink. Same old Jim, when lightning strikes you're there. - It wasn't a fair test. - Come on, let's get you a room. It's good to see you again Jim, I wasn't sure you'd come. I'm here. Yeah, I heard things hadn't been breaking too good lately. Well, that's a bootless job trail driving, I told you that when we split up 2 years ago. - Yeah. - Understand you finally got your own herd. Yeah and 2 weeks later, I saw them strung out along the bottom land, dead of a fever. Well, forget it, there's money in this deal, big money. Barney, how about a room for my friend here? Sure, I wouldn't wish one on him if he was a friend of mine, though. Oh, this has got your name on it. Somebody fired it through the back window during the ruckus. We're going out tonight fellas, I know where Lufton is crossing. - How do you know? - Never mind. I know. Be ready to leave in a half hour. Drink up Jim. Hey, wait here, I'll be right back. I suppose you'd like to know what this is all about. I have been kind of wondering, yeah. Well, I'm not going to tell you Jim, I'm going to show you. Come in. Jim, this is Mr. Pindalest, US agent for the Ute Indians over at the reservation. - This is Jim Garry, my partner. - How do you do? - You didn't tell me before about a partner. - Well, I'm telling you now. Before we go any further, I want it understood how he figures in this. You mean money? Don't worry Pindalest, I'll share with Jim. Well, here's the item we were talking about the other day. Think you find it satisfactory. United States dollars are usually satisfactory, aren't they? Now look, I told you that Garry is my partner Pindalest, what I know, he knows. - So relax and sit down. - No, I won't stay. Scared? Scared? Just cautious, Riling. Well, that's our partner Jim, cautious. And this is our working capital, courtesy United States Government. There's enough there to buy me 2500 head of Lufton's beef at 4 dollars a head. - That's cheap enough, isn't it? - Too cheap. - Where's the catch? - There isn't any. - You met Lufton, you say? - Yeah, I camped with him last night. Did he tell you that Pindalest had ordered his cattle off the reservation? Yeah, said they'd refused his beef. And did he tell you that the Army from Fort Liggett has orders to seize... the cattle if they're not off the reservation by the first of November? - No, he didn't tell me that. - Well, that's the layout Jim. I've organized these two-bit ranches to fight every move Lufton makes to... push his herd across the river into the basin here. And the ranchers will fight because they figure they're fighting for their own range. But the truth is they'll be fighting for me. Now, without any graze to move to... Lufton will be caught on the reservation and his herd seized. So what is he do? - Sell? - To me. Cheap, because he'd rather get a little money than lose everything. - Sounds like you got him over a barrel. - I have. I buy them cheap and sell them back to the government... through Pindalest for full contract price. Your cut will be 10,000 dollars. What I have to do to earn it? Lufton is tough and my ranchers aren't. - You make up the difference. - I see. Been mixed up in a lot of things Tate but up to now I've never been hired for my gun. Can you afford to be particular? - No, I guess I can't. - Now, you're talking Jim. I'll meet you down in the lobby in 10 minutes. Common slowpoke, don't you want to know if Dad got across? Of course. What's the matter? I get you out of bed too early? I'm worried about Dad, I hope he didn't have trouble crossing last night. There'll only be trouble if Riling found out about it. Nobody is crossed here. You're looking for someone Miss Lufton? So you're one of them. I guess Dad wasn't so wrong about you, after all. Wrong? He must've spotted you for one of Riling's gunmen the minute he saw you. Funny isn't it, Riling? But not to you. By now Dad probably got his herd across the river some place else... while you wait here at Rockyford to throw him back. - Is that why we're here? - Isn't it? Simply because Dad was smart enough to give this saddle tramp a note he was sure to read. He knew he'd tell you and decoy you over here. How you like it now Kris? You and your son. Why, you aren't even being led by a smart crook. We're only fighting for what belongs to us Miss Amy. You didn't fight for it before Riling gave you the idea. Why didn't you go to Dad Kris? Talk to him? You used to work for him, you know he's not unreasonable. Not unreasonable to kick us of our land? I don't believe I've seen you around here before. - You fighting for your own graze too? - No ma'am. And you? I thought you're all old timers fighting for the land you settled on Kris. At least it's in the open now. Paid gunmen against working riders. You did read that note, didn't you? - No. - You're a poor liar. Yes. Well, Lufton is across the Masakree. - John Lufton is no fool mister. - Garry didn't read that note. - Where did you get the tip? - None of your business Milo. I got a wrong tip and I won't get another. Now, if you don't like it Milo, just ride on out. Lufton is across the river with that herd. Yeah sure, but steers have got legs, they could be driven back. Now thing to do is find them before Lufton can get them scattered. After that we can move. Did you ever notice how them 4 always stick together? Why not? Reardon and Shotten work for Riling and... Garry is a friend who just came in to help. I can buy me that kind of a friend for 75 dollars a month and no questions asked. - You know Lufton is smart. - Yeah, smart enough to spot me. He spotted Shotten and Reardon in town before I even knew they were there. - They're a couple of beauties, who are they? - Doesn't matter who they are Jim. The thing that matters is that they don't scare easy. - Well, it's pretty crude. - Not so crude. I made everybody swallow it but Lufton and I'll make him swallow it too. Shotten, Reardon and me, hired gunmen. Shotten and Reardon get paid in gold eagles, you get paid in thousands. Yeah, only difference between us is the price. Alright boys, cut for town, I'll get in touch with you. Tate, I didn't know it was a trick of Dad's, I swear I didn't until I heard Amy say it. Of course, you didn't darling, forget it. It's done and now we've got to fix it. But I'm glad in a way. I couldn't bear it this morning when I thought maybe you and Dad were fighting. It isn't easy for you Carol. But I have to do what I'm doing, you see that, don't you? - Yes Tate. - You see, I'm a poor man darling. Money is come hard to me. Nothing for me to do but join up with men like... myself and fight for what little I've got. I've tried to make Dad see both sides of it. He's just as sure he's right as you homesteaders are. We've got to fight. But he's across now, what you going to do? I'm, I'm not going to ask you to risk your Dad's life darling. But I am going to ask you to help. Find out where he's holding the herd that he crossed... and get word back to me as soon as you can. You won't let any harm come to Dad, will you? You know you can trust me darling. Would've been a lot easier if one went through the gap. - We ought to make it by noon. - Yeah. We scatter them in the Scrub Pinion west of Avery's patch. Amy, what the devil are you doing here? You didn't think I'd stay home when you were this close. This is no place for you. Told Bart tell you girls I'd be home by noon. I told them but it didn't do no good. She was bent on coming along. Couldn't wait. Alright Cap, get him started. - Bart says you crossed without any trouble. - Yeah, we're primed for it but didn't come. I think I know why. A rider name of Garry drift into the ranch yesterday with a note? You mean that hired gunman of Riling's? So I had him pegged right. Too bad, he was a nice seeming fellow. - Too nice to read that note. - But he did. Yeah. - Do you think this Garry is a killer? - Joined up with Riling, didn't he? Get out of here Amy. Get them away from the river. I'll make Riling remember this. - They'll run till they're wore out. - Four days to the deadline. Take us a week to round them up and get them off the reservation again. Whoa baby. Hold now, hold. Is young Barden. I'd hoped it wouldn't come to this. Just a month ago me and him went to a shindig together. Yeah, he was a nice boy. Well, what do you want? It's about your son Barden. Was killed in the raid. Figured maybe that's what happened when he, he didn't come home. I was with him when he, he got hit. Nothing I can do. It's a big price to pay for a little bit of graze. Too bad you had to get mixed up in this fight Barden. I joined up with the other small ranches because I figured their fight was my fight. We ain't being paid to fight mister. I'm sorry about your so Mr. Barden. You can believe that if you want to. Oh sure, sure. Lived here more than half my life... my wife and my son. She died about four years ago and... now... now, he's gone. Go on in the hotel Amy. - I told you to ride on through. - So you did. Your time is up, get started. - Get out of here Amy. - No. - Go on in the hotel. - No. Don't move Lufton. You drift Shotten. - Get that girl out of there. - I said drift. What are we waiting for? But this is what Riling wants, he said so. - That's your horse Reardon, get moving. - I ain't taking orders from you. Alright Reardon, anytime you want. Make up your mind. I won't wait. - You won't be this lucky next time Lufton. - I don't get it Garry, I just don't get it. You're riding on, aren't you? I'm glad, not for us but for you, I want to thank you for this. I want to apologize too for what I said to you. - Don't let a man's whim fool you. - I haven't. - What do you want, amigo? - Whiskey. - Would you be looking for me? - I ain't looking for nobody mister. Is that you Kris? I heard about Fred, I'm sorry Kris, I'll make Lufton pay for that. What good will that do? Fred is, Fred is dead. Ah, it'll make me feel better. Did you come all the way over here to tell me that? No, I missed you this morning, I didn't know you'd be here. - Why are you? - I'm leaving the country. What? Kris, the fight is almost won. Why, Lufton's herd stampeded half way up the Three Braves. Who cares? Hey Jim, where you've been? I've searched the country for you. How you find me? Well, Settlemeir said you took the Commissary Road, so I took a chance. What's up? Well, let's have a drink, I've got news. Oye, give me a glass and a handful of cigars and then get out. - On the level Jim, what are you doing here? - Running out. - Any reason? - Two. Shotten and Reardon. I never heard of you running from a pair like that. - No, never did. - Then why? They were going to kill Lufton in cold blood till I stepped in. I'm glad you did. - Are you? - Jim, what's eating you? Oh, we've got more at stake here than a bag of marbles. - Mean you have. - Jim? Lufton isn't dead, he isn't even hurt. And after that stampede, he hasn't got a chance. - Then why bother about me? - Because I need you. You don't think Lufton would do business with me, do you? No. No, he'd rather lose his herd. Exactly, but today you stepped in and saved his life, he won't forget that. So, when you ride up with an offer he'll take it because he has to. No dice. - Why not? - That's something you wouldn't understand. Try me. Starts with your double cross of a bunch of poor... jug headed homesteaders and the hiring of gun hands. It goes on to your making love to a man's daughter... to get her to turn against her own father and your try for Lufton today. It goes past that, to the death of Kris Barden's son and that winds up right here... with Reardon waiting outside to see if I go with you or if he shoots me in the back. I've seen dogs who wouldn't claim you for a son Tate. Alright, get off him. I said get off him. Hold it, give him time. You'll make it to your horse? - Yeah. - Get out. Why did you do it? I always wanted to shoot one of you and he was the handiest. Get out. - What you doing here? - I want to see Lufton. Why, you dirty saddle stiff, get out of here quick. Lufton have to run me out. I don't need orders from him to cut down on you, get out. - What is it? - I'm looking for your father. - Well, he's gone... - Careful Miss Amy. It don't matter to him where your father is. It's alright Ted. That's a bad cut, come inside, I'll fix it. Sit down. Tate Riling? - Is he dead? - No. I keep thinking of what you said yesterday in Sundust. Was this a whim too, this business with Riling? It was a pleasure. - What brings you back? - Gall, for one thing John. Got into a little jangle with Riling down at Commissary last night. - I'm all through with him. - Yeah? You may not believe me Lufton. I just want to let you know what you're up against. - Then it's up to you. - I already know what I'm up against. You don't know Pindalest aimed to buy your herd, do you? He rejected it. He won't reject it when Riling offers it to him. Sure, Riling and Pindalest planned it together. Pindalest's part of the deal was to order you off the reservation. Riling was to prime the homesteaders to keep you out of the basin. You figure you can round up your stuff and cross it before the deadline? No. And rather than let the Army take it you'd sell it and take the loss, wouldn't you? Not to Riling. But to a stranger like me with cash in his pockets. Well, that's the deal. I was supposed to make the offer with Riling's money. I don't believe it. But he's right Cap. I'd be a fool not to sell. Well, I'll drift. - Just thought I'd let you know. - Jim, wait a minute. You don't tell a dead man he's dead, you came here for something else, didn't you? Well, I did have kind of an idea. - Might not be what you'd like. - Let's hear it. Suppose the deadline was put off for a week. That'll give you time to round up your herd. Deadline hasn't been put off. - Can be. - How? Pindalest would laugh at me if I ask him to. He wouldn't laugh at me. No, I'm not hiring a gunman to save my herd or anything else. Jim. Jim. Jim please, wait a minute. He didn't understand what you were saying, please don't go until he does. He understood alright. Now, step back. - I'm going to follow you till you turn back. - You got a long ride, I'm heading for Texas. Alright. You better quit this. You'll come back with me and give Dad a chance to apologize? No, but you better go. They'll be looking for you. I won't go unless you go with me. Well, I'm going to turn in. - I'm not leaving. - Well, you're not staying here. - Will you go back with me? - No. Then I won't go. I'll give you one more chance. No. You'll go now, unless you want more of that. I don't want more of it Jim, but I won't go. You really meant it, didn't you? That much. Jim, I know you better than you think. You've been in hard luck and you've made mistakes. You hated those mistakes. But you never admitted them except to yourself. Like this mess with Riling, you never liked it. That's why you walked out on it. Today, you tried to do something to make up for it... and Dad threw it back in your face, he thought you meant to kill Pindalest. I didn't think so, I know why you did it. You thought it would help wipe out the past. You're a proud man Jim. But this is the wrong kind of pride, if you ride on back to Texas, you're lost. Cap is gone on the head to get the drive started. Only hope Riling doesn't get wind of what Garry... is up to or there'll be the devil to pay. He knows what kind of man he's dealing with Dad. Yeah, I reckon he does. Any rate, it's our only chance. So you're going to let Dad risk everything just because... Garry sold you a wild lying scheme. Lying? You don't believe what Jim told me? No, why should I? He's nothing but a cheap gunman and a killer. - That's not so. Jim, wouldn't... - Jim? Yes Jim, what's the matter with calling him Jim? He's no more a gunman than I am. - Amy, what is this? - He's trying to help us. And I'll stick up for him to you or, or anyone else. Sounds a little stronger than sticking up for him. Maybe it is. But a gunman Amy? A man that will go up against hired killers. How did he get so expert? You thought of that? More than you know. - Nothing made him come back and help us. - Except wanting to get even with Riling. No, it's not that, he's really decent, he's... Does he love you? I don't know. You're a fool Amy, he'll break your heart. Come in, come in. - Who is it? - Jim Garry. Oh, oh, fine. Sit down, be right with you. Been riding all day, was just taking a little nap. - Drink? - Don't mind if I do. Well, how are things? Fine Mr. Pindalest, just fine. I brought that news you've been waiting to hear. Everything went off without a hitch, eh? Well, maybe one little hitch you might say. - What's that? - Lufton wants more money. - How much more? - Three thousand dollars. Riling said his selling price to you still held. - This was just a loan. - Oh? Well, if that's all that's holding us up there's nothing to worry about, eh? Success. You know... this is liable to cause a little trouble after all. I don't keep that much cash here at the agency. Lufton wants cash. Means I'll have to ride over to Sundust with you and draw it out of the bank. Riling figured you likely would. - How is the pass? Clear? - A little snow, it'll probably hold off. Well, I'll throw some stuff together and get out of here. Oh, I came close to forgetting. Riling says call off the Army. Lufton will likely run over the deadline rounding up some beef we stampeded for him. Riling says he doesn't want to have to explain to the Army about that. Good idea, I'll get a man off to Fort Liggett with a message right away. - Tate, what happened to you? - A fight. - Where have you been? - I couldn't get out. I know who you fought with, was Jim Garry. - How do you know? - He's been at the ranch. Tate, I want to talk to you about something, that's why I came here tonight. Well? What is it? Garry told us something very interesting. He said that you and Pindalest had cooked up... this fight with Dad to crowd him off the range. So he'd sell his cattle to you cheap. Is that true? So Garry told you that, did he? - Is it true? - What else did he tell you? This sounds good. That you wanted him to make the offer to Dad. - Did he tell your father that? - Yes. - Tate, you haven't answered me, is it true? - Yes, of course. You mean you've been making those poor homesteaders think it's... their right you're fighting for? I wanted money for us. This was the way to get it, a lot of it, money your dad could spare. Tate, look at me. Do you love me? - Have you ever loved me? - What you want me to say? - Sure. - Don't lie to me. You've used me to beat Dad, I betrayed him for you, that's all you ever wanted. - It's all you ever counted on, isn't it? - I didn't say that. Will you go in town with me this minute and marry me like you promised? Not until I get money enough to support you. - Oh? - What's funny? I was thinking of something I told Amy this morning. - Wasn't that Lufton's girl? - Yeah. - What's she doing here? - None of your business. - What are you doing here? - I thought you said Garry quit. - Well? - What's he doing at the reservation? - The reservation? - Yeah, yeah. Nels saw him there this morning heading for the agency. Feel kind of stiff, don't you? When we get to Sundust I'll sleep for a week. Oh, we won't be getting to Sundust for quite a while, going to stay right here. - What do you mean? - You've been taken in Mr. Pindalest. Riling never sent me to see you. I came to take you and hide you out till after the deadline. - And Lufton did not agree to sell? - No. And also he's rounding up those cattle right now with no Army to bother him. - But you're a Riling man. - Was, I'm with Lufton now. You can't get away with it Garry, Riling is no fool, he'll be on our trail in 24 hours. Let him. When he does find out what's happened he'll pull his men off to hunt you. That will make it all the easier for Lufton. I'd take it easy with that if I were you Pindalest. Might not last out the week. Don't move. Maybe I won't have to nurse this quite as long as you figured. If you're planning on moving out, you're going alone. I'm giving you a chance to change your mind. I'm staying here. Now look, I can lick you and you know it. You keep this up, you'll end up with a sore head and that's all, you suit yourself. Alright, you win. Untie me. Come on. Come on, cheer up Pindalest. Now we can start looking for a place to make camp. - Where are you? - Over here Riling. Riling, over here. Send the Indian to Fort Liggett with a message to bring the Army on. - Hey Milo? - Yeah. Get back to the basin. See that the boys hold Lufton on the reservation until the troops get there. - What about Garry? - We'll take care of him. Carol. Carol. You got to stop this. - I know. - I'll make some coffee. If I could've seen Dad and told him. You must stop thinking about it. If only we knew where he is, what's happening to him. You just got to believe that what Jim is doing will work. It has a good chance. - You really think so? - Of course I do. Why don't you go lie down for a while, I'll bring you some coffee. - Why Kris, I thought you'd left the basin. - Yeah, I did Miss Amy but... well, I guess I've lived around here a little too long. - Get kind of lonesome. - I knew you couldn't leave us for good. Well, I'm back to stay and I come over to ask for your help. Now, maybe I ain't got no right asking, considering who it's for but... You remember that young fella you combed out over at Rockyford the other day? - He's been hurt. - Jim Garry? Come home this morning, found him lying on the floor of my shack. - He got a knife stuck in him. - I'll go get dressed. It's me Jim. Lie still. - Got to get out of here. - No Jim. Kris. Kris, tell her to get out of here. I'm going to fix this up. He's asleep. Good. So him and your dad were in this together, eh? Yes. Young lady, you going on a ride. Riling is on his trail, he'll probably land up here sometime today. That's why Garry wanted to get you out of here. We got to get help, you know where your dad is? No, I don't. Oh, Kris, I don't, we haven't heard from Dad in days. Well, you better find him. What about Jim? If they show up, I can stand them off till your dad gets here. Don't let that worry you. Where you going to look for him? I don't know, somewhere south. I'll try and pick up the trail of the herd and follow him. Good. - What are you doing here? - I might ask you that. - Barden home? - Yes. - Who else is in there? - Nobody. You're a lovely little liar. Alright fellas, let's take a look. Bolt that door. Here, take this. - Riling? - Yes and Pindalest and Shotten. Look here Kris... before this goes any further, tell Riling I'll go with him. These walls is good and thick, they can't burn us out and we got plenty of cartridges. He won't quit until he's got me, and he'll kill you both to do it. So we let him shoot you just to save our necks? Then tell him she's coming out, they'll let her through. - No, I won't go. - Make her go. Why do you think she risked her neck to get back in here if it wasn't on account of you? - Why do you think I want to get her out? - The same reason, I reckon. He's right Amy. But it wouldn't work, not even if you'd have me, now will you go? No. Look, I've been fiddle footed and no good all my life, I... - I'm not asking any woman to take that. - I knew that when I came here. - That's what I am Amy, that's me. - Don't you see how useless talk is? I'm here and I'm staying. - Jim. - Yeah? Jim, what you doing up? I'm going out there to try and get a crack at them. No, let me talk. We can probably hold out for a few more hours. You ain't going out there just to save our necks. I'll try and save my own too. We may as well face it, they not going to give up. Nobody is likely to come along and help us. Then, I'll go. - I got a score to settle with Riling myself. - No Kris. It's me Riling is after, I'd like to finish this my own way. - You going to let him go Miss Amy? - Yes, she is. - Where are they exactly? - They are all scattered out. Riling is over to the left in them trees and the other two is closer to the corral. I can just make it to the corner of the corral I can circle around and get behind them. But they'll see you. As soon as I get out, you open up on them, that will draw a return fire. The powder flash blind them for a couple seconds, that's all I need. Ready? Hold it Miss Amy, hold it. I think he made it. Them last shots came from another direction. - Do you want to get hit? - But I've got to know. Hey, Shotten. Pindalest. Alright Riling, it's just you and me now. - It's a pleasure Jim. - For me Tate. Same old Jim. When lightning strikes, you're there. You and me together could a licked them. But you... You always had a conscience breathing down your neck. Jim. Riling is dead. Shotten too. - And Pindalest? - No. I don't think so, he's over there. Dad. Carol told me you were here, she was afraid there'd be trouble. - Where's Riling? - He's dead. Well Lufton... Don't look like you going to get Riling to do much talking. I'm going to have you arrested for murder. It was a fair fight John. And I'll tell that to the sheriff or anybody else that wants to know. Lufton was telling us about a little deal that... you and Riling had cooked up to swindle him out of his cattle. - What about it? - I had no deal with Riling. Don't forget I was in on it too. Well boys, that's the man you've been fighting for. Get your horse. Me and you are going to have a little talk with the marshal. Guess we've been a pack of fools Lufton. Say fellas. I got a jug I've been saving for a special occasion, this looks like it. What do you say, if we... Garry, I guess I was wrong about quite a few things. Yeah, I was wrong about a few things myself. We've been plenty stubborn. That's going to make two stubborn men in the family. Well, I guess Kris was right. This is a special occasion, come on.
