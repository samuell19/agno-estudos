Many centuries ago, in ancient Persia, the wealthy young men were sent... to the Imperial Military Academy in Baghdad by their fathers. Who in former years have endured hardships and privations... while fighting valiantly to rid the land of futile tyrants. It was a matter of the gravest concern to these fathers that their sons... reared in the lap of luxury, might prove unfitted to... withstand adversity, should strike. Kashma, happy birthday Kashma. - Happy birthday Kashma. - Happy birthday, Happy birthday Kashma. - I'll see you tonight, oh breath of my life. - We shall both see you. At the Academy, these young men were taught discipline... horsemanship and proficiency in the use of lance and scimitar. To all of which they dutifully applied themselves... while waiting for night to fall when they could indulge in... feasting and drinking in company with the fairest maidens in the land. By far the most dashing of these young blades was the son of Ali Baba. Renowned champion of the oppressed, Kashma Baba. Cadets of the Imperial Military Academy, it seems that I must again remind you... that as future officers of the Royal Guard Regiment... the highest standard of dignity is expected of you at all times. - Cadet Kashma Baba, are you listening? - Most earnestly Noble Commandant. Cadet Kashma Baba, we are delighted to be reminded that you were born... but we do not enjoy hearing it screamed from the balconies... while the Corps is on the line of march. - See that it doesn't happen again. - Hear and obey Noble Commandant. Troop, prepare to dismount. Dismount. Kashma, do you think the wenches will hear and obey? I shall lecture them severely tonight at the feast Mustafa. Don't forget comrades. Kashma has invited all his friends to his feast tonight. Rare wines from Khayyam's own vineyards... and the loveliest houris in all the land to entertain you. - Are you listening comrades? - Yeah. Am I also invited to your feast Kashma? Why Hussein, since when is the son of the Caliph become a friend of Kashma Baba? The lowborn son of a thief. Were it not for his father's immense wealth... that jackal would've never been permitted to set foot in the academy. Kashma wouldn't dare refuse us admittance to his feast Hussein. We could drink his rare wines and steal his loveliest houris. Mustafa, I'll give you my black stallion if you pull me across the table. Which I've wanted for a long time and which I will now get. - Come on Mustafa, pull him over. - Come on, Mustafa. - Pull, pull, pull. - Pull him over. - Come on Mustafa. - Pull, pull. Take your arm from Kashma Calu, we agreed he was to be mine for the first hour. I know we did Theda, but I've been thinking. How do I know I'm going to get him for the last one? - Stop worrying, you won't. - Kashma, Theda isn't being fair. I shall ride him in fond remembrance of you. The feast has but begun and already you've lost me my fine stallion. Now behave yourselves or by dawn I will be a pauper. One at a time Kashma. Be careful Kashma, they've been drinking and Hussein is looking for trouble. He looks hard enough, he'll find it. I suppose one must expect a reception of this kind. It's in keeping with your lack of breeding friend Kashma. Since you have seen fit to enter my house Hussein... you shall be accorded the privileges of a guest. Therefore accept my sincere apologies for that magnificently thrown plum. I shall even allow you to sit next to its fair thrower. Comrades, our uninvited guests have arrived in time. For Zaza, famed dancer from Cairo is about to entertain us. She has a grace of a gazelle and the fire of a goddess. - Tomorrow I'll tell you if you were right. - She shall be mine. I'll find you another, for you can never tell what is behind the mask. You want her for yourself. Kashma Baba always keeps the best for himself. Generously reserves the crumbs for his guests. If Zaza wants you Hussein, she shall be yours. I shall feast my eyes upon your dazzling beauty, o bird of paradise. You planned this, you lowborn son of a jackal thief. Kashma, guard yourself. Why do the boys always fight when they can have so much more fun with us? Patience, patience, they'll get to us in time. The odds are no longer even. I don't see why we have to share Kashma with Zaza too. We'll be lucky if we get the chance. Oh, my God. Let's give him a merry heave-ho, eh? Kashma, come here. The honor of expediting your most un-welcomed guest should be yours. One, two, three... - You'll suffer for this Kashma. - You must visit me again friend Hussein. Drink up comrades, the wine is plentiful and the night is young. Stop, stop. Come back here. Stop, I tell you, you're not allowed in here. Wait till I get my hands on you. If my master catches you, daughter of a vanishing flea... you will get 50 lashes in the marketplace. Come out miserable wench, come out I say. Alright, drown. Ten thousand curses upon you wench. What the...? - You feel better now? - Wetter, anyway. Must've been a wonderful feast, I feel terrible. Well? - What have we here? - That's what I'm trying to find out. Master, beware of that root of all evil. She pushed me in the pool, she... Quiet Babu. - Who are you? - Kiki, I come from Morocco. Kiki, eh? - I don't remember seeing you at the feast. - I was not there. I was hiding in the garden. - She confuses me, you try. - Your name is Kiki, eh? - You're from Morocco and you're hiding here? - Yes, from Rama. And now we're getting some place and who is Rama? Well, Rama has a troop of dancers and he is cruel, He beats me, that's why I'm hiding from him. And rightly so, none but a dog would lay hand on one so beautiful. And may I stay? - Well... - I will sing for you, I will dance... - I will... - Brighten our lives... - eh Mustafa? - Most assuredly Kashma. But master, you're due to report to the Academy within an hour, I myself will get rid of this unmentionable female for you. - Kiki will remain here as my guest. - Aye... This fiendish terror to be a guest in this house? But master, all dancing girls are notorious thieves. - That is not true. - Oh, but such a lovely thief. Hide her in the tower room where none of the servants will see her. You will be safe there until I return. Mustafa, you better clean up while I put on a fresh uniform... or we'll both be on the carpet before the Commandant. Your master is very kind and very handsome. Are you still angry because I kicked you in the pool? Am I still angry? Ayee. Come with me you triple tailed serpent of Gehenna. Of all the houses in Baghdad, why did you pick this one to hide in? Last night, as I fled through the alleys... I heard singing and laughter and I saw young men being tossed from an archway into a pool. And I said Kiki, in this house you will find happiness and much understanding. Where stays this Rama with his troop of dancers? Oh no, you will tell Rama where I am and he will take me away and beat me again. Besides, your master will be very angry if I'm not here when he returns. I only intended to learn if there is a man by the name of Rama who has a troop of dancers. Alms for the love of Allah. Alms for the love of Allah. Alms for the love of Allah. Alms for the love of Allah. Alms for the love of Allah, I die of hunger. I die of thirst, alms for the love of Allah. - My eyes have seen his blessing this day. - And so shall yours old one. Blessings on you noble master, may Allah give you long life and many sons. That was a goodly brawl. I lost my way last night and woke up in the marketplace with my arm around a mangy camel. But you did better than Mustafa. He couldn't even find a door to leave by. Believe me Herat, the one thing I was not hunting was a door. Why Hussein, Zaza was broken hearted that you left her suddenly. She thought you were very ill mannered... but I assured her that was impossible since you are the son of the Caliph. Someday the son of the Caliph will kill you. - I shall be careful not to turn my back. - Attention. It will be unfortunate for you Cadet Baba... if there's any caterwauling by wenches from their balconies today. I've warned all the wenches noble Commandant. Troops, attention. Prepare to mount, Mount. Advance in column of twos, from the left. Walk, march. Kiki. What you've done with Babu? He isn't in the house so I thought probably you kicked him in the pool again. Well, if he were here I would, he doesn't like me, he still thinks I'm a thief. Babu is a very suspicious man. You see, he himself was once a thief. He was a member of a band of 40 thieves, my beloved father Ali Baba was their leader. Your father was a leader of a band of thieves? Who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. The rich called him a thief, the poor worshiped him. And Kashma takes after his father. He's kind to the poor, to those who are in much trouble. Such a small hand to be in trouble. The softness tells me it has not known hard work. And what else does it tell you? - Master, master. - Go away Babu, I'm very busy. Master, I must talk with you in private, it is most important. Now tell me what else you see in my hand. That there's no such person as Rama and no troop of dancers from Morocco in Baghdad. So now Babu is happy. Why did you lie to me? I was afraid you wouldn't let me stay. If I told you I'd escaped from the harem of the Caliph. You escaped from the harem of the Caliph? Well would you want to spend your life in his harem? I could devise a worst fate for myself. How is it that you fell into his clutches? I was a handmaiden to the Princess Azura of Fez. We were traveling to Cairo when Bedouins attacked the caravan. They brought the princess here and sold her to the Caliph... who now sends her as a gift to the Shah. I was destined for the Caliph's harem. Hiding an escaped slave is a very serious crime. Especially one belonging to the Caliph. Do you wish me to go away? I shall always remember you Kashma. Were you to leave, the stars would lose their brilliance... and night its magic. - Check. - What is Areef? The slave girl signaled from the window that all goes well Excellency. - And Kashma Baba? - Has but now returned to his house. - Your spy is done well Kareeb. - He always does well Excellency. Captain Baka you have your orders, see that you carry them out skillfully. I believe that is checkmate Kareeb. Except for my black knight which now takes your queen. And I regret Excellency, it is you who is checkmated. My father's palace lies in a broad valley on the banks of the Euphrates. - Is that very far away? - About 12 hours' ride from here. Some say it's the most beautiful spot in all the land. In the palace gardens there are rare flowers. The fountains crystal clear and the air is filled with the scent of jasmine. I've often dreamed of dwelling in an enchanted palace. Perhaps someday you will. You could've waited and given her a chance to choose between us. When it comes to Kiki I've decided to be a very selfish fellow. Well, if you want to keep her you'd best hide her. The Caliph's guards are searching the houses up the street. More highhandedness from his Excellency, what is it this time? They seek a slave girl who's escaped from the palace. You might find it difficult to account for her. I would indeed, for Kiki is the missing slave girl. But I thought... You'll have to get her out of here, for none search so expertly as the Caliph's guards. And the Caliph and his son have no love for me. It would please them mightily to find her here. The Caliph would've you kicked out of the corps and thrown into prison. Quick, you must do something Kashma. I know, I know, but where can I hide her in this accursed house. Perhaps there's someplace in your father's valley where I could hide. The very thing. But the hiding place will be my father's palace. Open in the name of your Caliph. Master Master, the Caliph's guards search the house next door. To the stables quickly. Goya, the silk merchant, is old and feeble Captain. I doubt that his house will yield a missing slave girl. But nevertheless, my orders are to search all houses. However, the house of Kashma Baba may prove more fruitful. Master, I bet you not to take this root of all trouble to your father's palace. You misjudged Kiki and you worry too much. There's nothing to worry about. The guards seek a slave girl who escaped from the Caliph's palace. Now, she is no longer here. - Kiki is the missing slave girl? - And very lovely too. Ayeee. Come, we'd best return to the house for unwelcome guests will arrive shortly. Kashma Baba and the missing slave girl just left by the rear gate Captain. Excellent, she has followed the Caliph's orders exactly and now so shall we. Guards, follow me. Open up, open up in the name of the Caliph. What do you want? Where is Kashma Baba? Word came that his father had been taken ill, Kashma like a dutiful son left immediately. - We are not looking for him. - Then whom do you seek? We seek a slave girl who has escaped from the Caliph's harem. I'm sorry Captain but we're just out of runaway slave girls. However, you'll probably want to look around anyway. That I will. The instant I set eyes on this misbegotten daughter of deceit... - I knew she would bring evil on this house. - Kiki is gone. No one can prove she was ever here, there's nothing to worry about. What? No missing slave girl? - Whence comes this? - Small and dainty. And from the exquisite perfume, the owner was very lovely. If you find her Captain, let me know who she is and I shall reward you. Perhaps this will enlighten you. It resembles a golden half moon resting on a bank of a clouds. Exactly. It is the crest of the captive Princess Azura of the Royal House of Fez... whom the Caliph is sending as a gift to the Shah. Last night she escaped from the palace. You mean the missing slave girl is the Princess Azura? None else. And my gay young peacock... this handkerchief was found among the cushions in the tower room. Arrest Cadet Mustafa and this shivering servant, take them to the palace. This is my father's palace and yonder lies the Valley of the Sun. I've never dreamed anything could be so beautiful. There is an apartment in the east wing... that overlooks the bend in the river, it shall be yours. What is it? Aren't you happy? Ever since I can remember when I am most happy I, I want to cry. Then I shall have to warn my father about you. For he is always said that there's no room for tears in the Valley of the Sun. Quick, take cover among the rocks. If the Caliph's guards, I shall lead them from you, hurry. - Tala. - Kashma. Oh, it is good to see you again, it is been so long. During which time you've become a woman and a very lovely one. Ah, I see you've had good hunting as usual. Yes, I shot these at dawn, I'm taking them to your father. Tala, this is Kiki, lovely, isn't she? I've seen none fairer, what is she doing here? Kashma rescued me from the harem of the Caliph. When Kashma and I were children... we used to pretend that I was a princess in the power of an evil king. And then when I was about to be thrown into his harem... I would scream for Kashma who always arrived in time to rescue me. Remember Kashma? And now, were I to get into trouble, why I would scream for Tala to rescue me. After which I would carry him off to my lair in the forest. Such muscles, such endurance. Are not Og and Mog magnificent Noble Ali Baba? Yes, I suppose they are Ishmael. But they've been tied up like this for 3 days now and it's getting a trifle monotonous. But Master, they are the greatest endurance wrestlers in all Asia. Why, only last year in Samarkand Og and Mog tied each other in knots for 7 weeks. It's a calamity which I assure you, shall not be repeated here. - Kashma? - Father. Greetings Tala. You have an unexpected leave from the Academy? Father, this is Kiki, we need your help. Come, let us seek a quieter place to talk. Now tell me of this trouble you are in my son. Kiki was handmaiden to the Princess Azura of Fez. Bedouins attacked the caravan... brought Kiki and the Princess to Bagdad and sold them to the Caliph. There is evil in the world and much of it is wrought by the Caliph. The Caliph is sending the Princess as a gift to the Shah. Kiki was destined for his harem but she escaped and hid in my house. Freedom is a treasure beyond price. And here in the Valley of the Sun my daughter, you shall find it. When Kiki is most happy she always wants to weep father. But I perceive another motive for bringing Kiki here beyond placing her in safety? I find that life without her would be very lonely Father. And you my daughter? I think I love Kashma, but we've just met. - Later perhaps, he should still want me. - I shall always want you. Oh, she's very happy father. With all this happiness I have a feeling I am about to gain a daughter. So this is the young man who helped Kashma Baba steal the royal captive? What you've to say for yourself? I remember nothing Excellency. The young man remembers nothing out of loyalty to his friend Kashma Baba, no doubt. Cadet Mustafa, I advise you to loosen your tongue at once. It is not necessary for him to speak Commandant. I have been informed that Kashma Baba has fled to his father's palace... taking with him the Princess Azura whom I was sending as a gift to the Shah. I've dispatched a courier to the Shah advising him of this outrage to his... dignity and requesting permission to avenge his honor. After your court-martial Cadet Mustafa, Commandant... please send him to me for more suitable punishment. - Captain Yussef. - Sir? Take the prisoner to the guardhouse. Prisoner and escort, forward, march. I had hoped for brilliant military careers for you and Kashma. I am indeed sorry. What will they do to Kashma's father if the princess is found in his palace? It's treason against the mighty Shah. For that his estates and great wealth will be confiscated. It's a pity Kashma's father will receive no warning of this impending attack. Mustafa... if you were to hit an officer of the Corps and steal his horse... you could be in no worse trouble than you are already. May Allah bless you for this Captain. What? After him. Steady those horses sir. The thousand devils, have you learned nothing at the Academy? You've been informed of the outrageous crime committed by two of your comrades. His Excellency the Caliph... has graciously given you the opportunity to wipe out the stigma... against the honor of the Corps of Cadets... by inviting you to ride with him to the palace of Ali Baba... and avenge the insult to His Exalted Eminence, the Shah. Any cadet who does not wish to volunteer, let him advance. Your Excellency, Your Excellency, this is, this is treason. - And I shall report it to the Shah. - Yes, Your Excellency. - Captain Yussef. - Sir? See that these traitors are confined to the Academy for the next hundred and eighty days. The remaining loyal cadets will take their places at the head of the column. Walk, march. Until further notice the guards will be instructed... to permit no cadet to leave the limits of the Academy. Gentlemen, I salute you. The Caliph is an avaricious man and if he should learn that Kiki is here, I think... that gold will quickly sooth his anger. It's you I'm worried about my son. By now Mustafa is explained to Captain Yussef that you were ill and I had to come to you. The Captain is a good friend of the cadets. Even so, you are absent without leave from the Academy which is a serious offense. At dawn Kashma, you must return to Bagdad. We shall do our best to console Kiki during your absence. Mustafa? What is happened? The Caliph had spies watching your house Kashma. He knows you brought the missing slave girl here. My father will buy Kiki's freedom from the Caliph. Come, join us at the feast. The Caliph cannot sell what he is already promised to the Shah. - Am I not right, Your Royal Highness? - Royal Highness? Kiki is no handmaiden, she's the Princess Azura of Fez and promised to the Mighty Shah. Princess? Kiki, tell me this is not true. - I only sought to regain my freedom. - Regardless of the cost to your friends. The love you bear my son Princess, is a strange one. Father, I never dreamed... The Caliph and his guards are riding to attack this palace... to avenge the insult to the Shah. Well, at least your tidings broke that up. The Caliph has long sought an excuse to crush the House of Baba. Now seems he's found it. If harm befalls Kashma or his beloved father, I shall slit your... Kashma gave his protection to the Princess, no harm must come to her. The important thing now is to decide how best to deal with the Caliph. The old 40 thieves would've known how to deal with him. But we are not longer young. Therefore, we must fight him not with arms, but with strategy. Kashma, you and Mustafa take the Princess to the hills and watch over her. The rest of you, hurry back to your farms. But Father, what of you? I shall ride to the palace of the Shah, may be possible I can explain this matter to him. - But if you fail? - It shall be as Allah wills. Now, hurry, my son, for there is little time. If Your Highness is ready. Saddle my horse for me Ishmael. We have searched thoroughly Excellency but this all the treasure we can find. A mere pittance. Where do you hide your treasure? So it is not the Princess you seek after all? - Where is it? - That you shall never learn. Oh, he's old Father. Another blow would break his scrawny neck and we're not done with the mangy Thief. Dead, he will be but slim pickings for the vultures Alive he will serve us well. What do you mean? His son must also know where this treasure is hidden. And he would deliver to the palace to ransom his father from the dungeons. Word of this left among the farmers of the valley would soon reach Kashma's ears. The Shah shall learn that you came not to avenge him... but in search of treasure for yourself. Take him out. But first still his tongue to stop his seditious ravings. Hussein, put the palace to the torch. I want no monument left to the house of Baba save, only ashes. You two men stay with me, Farouk, Dragna, wait outside with our horses. I do not like the thought of my father riding alone to the palace of the Shah. I sense an evil hand is wrought this chain of circumstances. Mustafa... why do you think the spies of the Caliph were watching my house? There was no reason... unless they'd followed the Princess when she escaped from the Caliph's palace. The spies follow the Princess yet do not arrest her. And of all the houses in Bagdad, she chooses mine to hide and still the spies do nothing. Then they permit her to escape. Strange, indeed. Perhaps Your Highness can solve this riddle. I didn't escape from the palace. The Caliph sent me to your house. - He promised me that if... - When I held you in my arms, I should've tasted the venom on your lips. A princess with the heart of a carrion. Kashma, the Caliph and his guards swarmed into the... palace before I could saddle your father's horse, I had no chance to warn him. Kashma, wait, alone you can do nothing, you'll only be killed, Kashma... Guard her well, lest she escape to rejoin the Caliph. You'll wreak no more harm on my master. Over there. Wait... if you kill one the other will give the alarm and Kashma might be caught. I will remain on watch, if Kashma is captured my arrows will serve to rescue him. Kashma is lucky to have so lovely a protector. What you've done with my father? That you will learn from the peasants if you live. - They've fired the palace. - What of Kashma? He may still be inside. Keep me covered, I'll try to find out. It's Mustafa. Quick, into the palace. - How did I get out here? - Allah lent me the strength. You, Princess? You risked your life to save me? Is it so strange that a girl would do so for the man that she loves? - Where's Hussein? - He fled the room after wounding you. He must not escape. Hussein, Hussein... Hussein, halt Hussein, stand and fight. I shall return with the palace guards, you and your father's people shall pay for this. The devil's own luck is with me. For with Hussein as my prisoner, his life would've been hostage for my father's. Kashma. We searched the palace for you, we feared you had perished. Perished I would've, had not the Princess dragged me from the flames. Yet she did not hesitate to lie to you and to bring evil upon you and your father. Who is now a prisoner of the Caliph. My mother is also a prisoner of the Caliph. If I failed to induce you to take me to your father's palace she was to die. A likely tale. You don't believe me. I believed Kiki the dancing girl, I even believed Kiki the runaway slave. - But to believe... - By tomorrow she will have another story. You have obeyed the order of the Caliph. Why do you not return to him and claim your mother's freedom? Because I've learned that the word of the Caliph is not to be trusted. - Look who speaks now of trust and distrust. - Beware, Kashma. She may be spinning another web to trap you. We must warn the people of the valley to flee to the hills... before Hussein returns with the guards to avenge Dragna and Farouk. It is fortunate for the people of the valley that you're safe Your Highness. For your father gave me orders that if any harm had befallen you... every farm in the valley was to be put to the torch. Then you did not find me... until after every farm in the valley had been put to the torch. That's an order Captain Baka. Vengeance, vengeance. If you want vengeance there's the one who is brought this evil upon us. Kill the traitoress. Stand back all of you. Are you mad that you would avenge yourselves against a defenseless girl? If so then you are more evil than the Caliph's guards. She is a fiend in human form. What of our farms that she is helped to destroy? The Princess was but another victim of the Caliph's evil schemes. He is long sought an excuse to rob my father of his treasure. - Stand aside, Kashma. - Out of the way. No Kashma, I shall not come between you and your people. Though the flames devour your farms you have not lost all. You still have your freedom. But my beloved father who gave you this freedom... rides in chains to the Caliph's palace, have you no thought of him? Aye. In our blind anger we did forget our noble benefactor. Forgive us Kashma. Kashma. Kashma. - Who did this to you Hassan? - The Caliph's guards. They sent you this message. If you deliver your father's treasure to the palace... in turn the Caliph will release your father. The promises of the Caliph are as black as the dried blood in his torture chamber. He would accept the treasure then throw us into the dungeon beneath the palace. Kashma. You know, we'd gladly give our lives for Ali Baba... but we are few, what can we avail against the Caliph's guards? Many years ago a stalwart band of 40 thieves... feared not another evil Caliph and his hired butchers. True. I myself did slay four of that Caliph's guards. Now I am old and my weapon arm is weak. But the weapon arm of your son is strong. Is his heart craven as a jackal's... or is it valiant as was yours when you rode with my father into battle? Let all the sons of the 40 thieves... who fear not to attack the Caliph's palace step forward. I will ride with you Kashma. - And I. - Lead the way. - Count on me. - I will go with you Kashma. See to your weapons, we ride within the hour. I must go with you Kashma. You are afraid I would try to escape to warn the Caliph. You are anxious to ride with us because of your mother Princess? And for the same reason that I dragged you from the fire. I shall guard her until the attack begins, after that she can do no harm. Come, we must find robes to cover these uniforms. Thank you Tala. My eyes are not blinded by love, I shall guard you well. Comrades, we disperse here. Keep your weapons hidden beneath your robes. When darkness falls we shall assemble in the marketplace. - May Allah ride with you. - And with you too Kashma. And so I ordered the Commandant to have Corps of Cadets... escort the Shah into the city Excellency. Why do you think our mighty ruler honors us with this sudden visit? Perhaps his visit has to do with Ali Baba. Then I shall inform His Magnificence... that Ali Baba resisted my guards and perished in the flames of his palace. Hussein, I'm glad you're safe, I was worried about you. Tell me my son, what of the palace of Ali Baba? It lies in ashes, together with all the farms in the Valley of the Sun. The crops in those farms were very valuable. They are naught compared to the treasure of Ali Baba. And soon Kashma will be knocking at our gates to ransom his thieving father. When I think of the 178 dreary days and nights that have to pass... before those handsome boys can come and visit us again. Well, what is there to be so happy about? I'm thinking of that 179th night. Look Theda, the royal banner of the mighty Shah. Who cares? Kashma. Oh Kashma, life is been so lonely since you left us. Nobody come to see us anymore. The Commandant ordered the cadets confined to the barracks for 178 days... for refusing to ride on your father's palace. It's too early for the corps to be returning from the drill grounds, what is happening? They escort the Mighty Shah to the Caliph's palace. The Shah here? Kashma, we cannot risk harm to the person of the Shah. We'll have to postpone the attack. So long as my father is a prisoner in the Caliph's palace, I shan't postpone my plans for neither potentate nor Shah. Tonight the Caliph will be feasting the Shah in the banquet hall, here. It is through this window that must shoot your arrows... to create confusion while we storm the gates. Do you think you can do it? Do not fear Kashma, my arrows shall find their mark. If we are successful this night it shall be because of you Tala. Troops, prepare to dismount. Dismount. Troops, dismissed. I've brought you much unhappiness, haven't I? There are many things I shall have to forget. I assure Your Exalted Eminence, I had always held Ali Baba in great esteem... and I was profoundly shocked to discover it was with his sanction... the Princess Azura was stolen from you. I've known Ali Baba for many years, I've valued his friendship. It is difficult to believe that he would turn against me. But it is true Your Exalted Eminence Ali Baba's son stole the princess for himself. When we rode to the palace to demand her return, we were... attacked and two of my comrades were slain. It's time for us to be leaving Kashma. Kashma, I have a right to go with you for my mother is also a prisoner of the Caliph. If that is true, we shall try to save her also. - You still don't trust me. - I do not know how this night will end. But if by dawn I've not returned, take this gold and buy passage on a ship to Morocco. He still loves her. For each woman, there is a man to love her. If I've misjudged you Princess... remember only that the slave girl I once held in my arms I loved truly. See to it that she does not escape. Kashma is no longer interested in us. Yet now we must guard his woman for him. Think you that is fair Theda? Men are never fair, but if we are, we don't get any. And it was only after my son's two comrades had been slain... that I attacked and fired the palace. Ali Baba the traitor, perished in the flames. - Father. - He's dead. Your Eminence, this way. Guards. Guards. An assassin, search the balconies. I sent three arrows through the windows of the banquet hall. The first found its mark, the Caliph is dead. Once we enter the palace, we turn right down the steps to the dungeon. Guards, guards, an assassin is loose, follow me. Come back, come back. Oh Kashma will be furious with us. Little fool, you want to break your neck? Oh, she's jumped across the barracks wall. Now she will have all those wonderful cadets to herself. Perhaps she will send some of them over here. Would you? - Why tarry we? - Well, stop tarrying and come on. Oh, hurry, hurry, we'll be too late. They've burned Ali Baba's palace to the ground and they took him prisoner. - And where is Kashma? - Here in Baghdad. He and Mustafa are at the Caliph's palace now with some of the young farmers. They're trying to rescue his father. He only has a few men and there are many palace guards. You got to help them or they'll be killed. - Attention. - At ease. Just how did you gain entrance to the barracks? I came over the rooftops and I leaped across to the wall of the barracks. Do you suppose you could guide us back the same way? Oh yes, but we must hurry for Kashma is in great danger. Let those who would come with me get their weapons. - Here we are boys. - Here we are. - Wait boys, we're here. - Well, can't you see? We're here. Boys boys, this is me, Calu, here I am. Oh, for pity's sakes. What hath the Princess that we hath not? All the cadets. Have done with your fiendish torture. He can stand no more, you'll kill him. It's useless to try to appeal to them Ali Baba. It will only goad them to further brutality. Father, they shall pay for this. But first my son, you must release Kiki's mother, the Princess Karma. Then she spoke the truth. Release the prisoners. The hand of Kashma Baba is behind this. We searched the palace and found no one Your Highness. Then you search the houses near the palace. And put all to torture until they reveal the assassin who loosed the arrows. Captain Baka, somebody is broken through to the dungeons. Block all the exits from the palace, we'll have them in a trap. Guards, follow me. Guards, guards. If Allah is with us, we shall escape the palace. We heard shouting then all was quiet, - perhaps too quiet. - May be a trap. - Then we shall fight our way out of it. Guard my father and the Princess closely. We can't break through, we'll make our stand in the Great Hall. At them guards, slay the traitors. Go on. Ali Baba. The Caliph informed me that you had perished in the flames of your palace Ali Baba. But he did not inform Your Exalted Eminence... that he had contrived a situation to make me appear traitorous in your eyes. The Caliph sent my daughter the Princess Azura to the house of Kashma... with orders to make him take her to the palace of Ali Baba. If she failed I was to die by slow torture. The instigator of that evil plan was yourself Kareeb. Forgive me Your Exalted Eminence, it is true. The Caliph ordered me to devise a scheme to enable him to... gain the vast treasure of Ali Baba. Put your swords, put your swords. Hussein. Assemble the prisoners. You had best see if you can make peace with the Mighty Shah for all of us. It's an order Cadet Baba. You have fought valiantly... even as your noble father did before you. Old and trusted friend, you have need of a new palace... and I of a new Caliph I can trust to rule Baghdad. The Princess Azura is very lovely. But guard her closely... for not even a Shah would be above stealing her. Hear and obey, Most Exalted Eminence. Mother, this is Kashma who trusts no one, not even his own heart. In spite of the falsehoods she tells Your Highness, I love her dearly. Have I your Royal permission to relieve you of her care? I prophesy an era of great peace and tranquility in my homeland.
