Oh, they, uh, they put that system in a few years ago after a break-in. Oh, don't worry. Neighborhood's a lot safer now. Enchantée! Enchantée. Are you okay? Oh. Are you alright, Miss Stanhope? Thank you, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just... just a little wobbly. Thank you, my dear. Too kind. Of course. We're not first-come, first-serve. Doesn't hurt to take a look. I'm Jerry. I'm the manager. Just give a shout if you have a question. Are there a lot of dogs in the building? Yeah, it's a pet-free, smoke-free complex. Alrighty. Local contact? Yeah, I just moved here. I don't really know anyone. Okay, that's no problem. What brought you to LA? I guess I'm trying to start a new life. That sounds ridiculous. I don't know. No, not at all. It's a good city for that. Oh, you, uh, missed one here. Any pets? No. Okay. Very helpful, Giles. Mm. Okay. Hi. There you are. Haven't you been getting my calls? I've been busy. When are you coming home? I'm staying. I got a job. Making costumes? Already? No, Dad, I'm... I'm working as a temp. At a law firm. It's just for now. I'm gonna start taking extension classes next quarter. You know, I don't know if you're trying to punish me or punish Diane. - But your mother certainly would not have wanted you... - Don't. Dad, please don't. I just worry about you, sweetie. Do you really think you can do this all by yourself? I don't know. I guess I'll find out. Well, dammit, I'm... Come on, you know I didn't mean that... Dad, I have to go. I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye. Lisa. Lisa, I asked you to renumber the footnotes for each section. No, you didn't. Are you calling me a liar? You want me to renumber them? Just ask. You don't have to pretend I fucked up. Give me half an hour. Oh, and I'm leaving at three. I'm up for a sitcom. Enjoy the show? Sorry. Sweetie, I'm just fucking with you. I'm Lisa. You the new temp? - Sarah. - Good to meet you. I'll introduce you around later. I know everyone. Thanks. Hello? Yes, this is she. Really? Shut up, okay? We're almost there. Hey! You got it! We're neighbors. Oh, I'm... I'm Brian. I'm Sarah. Um... Let's do an elbow bump. - Good to meet you. - Good to meet you. Um, hey listen, we're having a barbecue. You should come. Yeah, I'll try. Um, I got a bunch of stuff to bring in. Hang on. Hey, guys, - you wanna give us a hand? - Yeah, sure! Um, yeah, let me just run... I'll... Give me a second, okay? Okay. How lovely our barbecue has turned out to be a welcome party for you. Enchantée. Here they are. Our power couple. Oliver is a big-time attorney, and Esther is an even bigger-time doctor. This is Jessica. She just moved in on the second floor. Sarah. Oh. I'm sorry, Sarah. I just... No, I'm terrible with names, too. It's nice to meet you both. Welcome. We're so glad to have you in the building. Gettin' settled in okay? - Sure you don't need anything? - Leave her alone. She doesn't need us pestering her. Sorry. We'll stay out of your hair. Oh, no, it's okay. Everyone's been really nice. Good. Good. We like to make this place feel like a real neighborhood. - Mm. - It's great. Yeah, it seems like most places these days, people don't even bother to learn each other's names. Oh, speaking of which, our daughter Natalie... Natalie! Natalie! I saw that. What's the first rule? Sorry. Kids. Medium rare? You should read this. I... what? It changed my life. Oh, um. That's okay. Thanks. Hey. Did you have a good time? Yeah. I still can't believe I got it. Out of all those people. What? I might have, uh, put in a good word with Jerry. All I did is tell him what you did for Miss Stanhope. Does she have family? Just us. We all kind of take care of each other here. I love that. LA can be so... Lonely. I should go. Unpacking. Of course. Well, um, goodnight, neighbor. Goodnight, neighbor. Miss Stanhope? - Can I walk you home? - Oh. Well, only if you'll call me Edie. We're friends, aren't we? This is you? You're beautiful. Di... did you see it? It was a terrible picture. I was an awful actress. I'm so much happier now. I have such wonderful neighbors. You and me both. Zoloft. Fifty milligrams. Well, when can I get a refill? Okay, thanks. Hey, I got it, I got it, I got it. Oh, no, you don't... you don't have to... Moving is exhausting. Yeah, I didn't sleep well. Oh, yeah? Does the plumbing do that every night? Do what? Do you wanna open the door? Oh, no. No. I... I got from here. - Thanks. - You... you sure? Um, uh, okay. Um, I'm just down the hall. Giles, you are really messing with my love life. Stupid cat. Giles? Giles, come on, buddy. I need cuddles. Giles? Edie! Edie? Edie, what are you doing? I... I'm okay. Thank you. I'll refill this every week so you don't have to worry about it. Are you sure you don't mind? I'm an expert. I used to do this for my mom. Where can I put these so you'll remember to take them? Oh, just put 'em up on the counter. Did that guy give you this? Hmm? What guy? That creepy guy with the weird glasses. You know, he tried to give me this at the party. Oh, you mean Lester. Oh, he's not creepy, he's just a little bit sad. He recently lost his wife to cancer. Just lovely, lovely lady. I'm sorry. I didn't know. I didn't mean to... I'm just tired is all. Do you hear that noise that the pipes make at night? Oh, honey, I don't hear anything very well anymore. Oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me. Sarah, it's Dad. Give me a call back when you get this. Listen, I'm glad you found a place. I'm concerned, you don't seem to have much of a plan beyond these extension classes. Alright, listen, I'm gonna find time, I'll fly out... Hey. Hey! Hey! I'm, uh, glad I caught you. You okay? Just tired. Uh, what's up? Um, I'm having a dinner party later tonight around seven. Uh, you wanna join us? I... I don't know. Oh. Um, o-o-okay. Uh, no pressure. I... it was, uh, short notice. No, it sounds... it sounds really great. - I'll be there. - Yeah? Well, alright. Then I'll see you tonight then, neighbor. Sarah. Check your e-mail. I got two more reports from accounting. Uh, could I do them first thing in the morning? - I just... - No, today. But, clock out first. We can't pay overtime on this. Mm-kay? Sure. Hey. Hey. Fuck that hatchet-faced bitch. I don't know why I can't just... God, I'm so tired. You do look like dog shit. Thanks. It's my fucking apartment. I thought you loved that place. Hot neighbor guy? You like Thai food? Yeah, I... Oh, shit. I was supposed to go to this. Doesn't matter. It's fine. There you are. Hey. I'm sorry. I forgot I already had other plans. Oh. Uh, don't worry about it. Uh, we're gonna be having dessert a little later if you wanna stop by. Yeah. Maybe. Okay. Is that the guy? He's cute. Oh, Giles. That's disgusting. - You think I'm crazy. - No. I don't know. Maybe? It looks kinda great. No, I know. - It's just normally the pipes would be... - Did you do these? They're really good. Oh, shit. What? I was supposed to... God, I completely forgot. I... I missed the deadline for the extension program. I'm so fucking tired all the time, and I can't get my prescription, and I keep getting these headaches, and... and my neighbor is gonna report my cat, so then I'll have no one left to talk to. Hey, it's okay. You can always pet my head. Maybe fucking asshole Dad is right, and I should just go home. No. That's some horseshit. I don't know. I was always such a daddy's girl. You would've hated me. Probably. He bought you a Lexus. Yeah, well, I paid for it. The shit he put me through. Cheatin' on your mom? There was more to it than that. You know what? Doesn't matter. Fuck your dad. He doesn't get to tell you what you're capable of. You just gotta sack up and do whatever it takes to make it. Sack up? Hashtag sexist. Ovary up, whatever. Fallopian up. Vag up. You gotta fucking vag up, okay? You don't like this place? Break the fucking lease. Shit, you and I should get a place together. There's always gonna be dads and Cristinas who say "You can't do this" and "You gotta do that." - You just can't let them get... - Hey, how do you do that with Cristina? Stand up to her? I would just... I would be so afraid. It's pretty simple. I just remind myself that it's my fucking life. My fucking life. Yeah, it is, girlfriend. Help! Help! Please stop! No, no, no, no! Lester? Please. Lester, please don't do this. Wait, what are you doing? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! God damn it. Fucking Ikea. Help! I need help! - Sarah? - Esther, please! You have to... run. Run! - Brian, what the hell is going on? - Nothing! Everything's fine. Oh, no don't let him get close to you. It's all under control. She's not going anywhere. Help me! Please! Somebody help me! This is why we do the dinner party. It's such a bad way to start. It's not my fault. She said she would come. - I told you we were rushing things. - We had to. - She was about to move out. - That's enough. No harm done. Everything's fine. Go back to bed. What's happening? Why won't anybody help me? Oh. We are helping you. Help! Help! Hello? Somebody please help! Save your voice. Nobody can hear you. Please, please just let me go. You can't do this. You can't just keep me here. Of course we can. Yesterday, you quit your job. You closed your bank account, your credit cards. You cut ties with the few people who might care that you're gone. Hey! What's goin' on Sarah? You know what? I got your message loud and clear. And congratulations. Whatever you said to Cristina almost got me fired, too. You want me out of your business? Stay the fuck out of mine, you two-faced, crazy ass bi... Sarah, no one's coming for you. Why are you doing this to me? Let's get on with it. Face the wall. Put your hands on the wall. Right there. Oh, no. No, no. Please. Brian, please, no. You don't have to do this. Please. Please. Wait. Let me show you something. This program's very simple. You comply, you get rewarded. If you don't... you get punished. So, it's really up to you how it goes. Most people take to the conditioning right away. Lester, on the other hand, was resistant. That was for attacking me. And that was for trying to escape. You get the idea. You ready to do what you're told? Good. Good. Face the wall. Put your hands on the wall. Step back. Further. Further! Look at the wall. This is a stress position. It's designed to be painful. In a few minutes it'll start to hurt. In an hour, it'll seem unbearable. When those lights are on, you do not move, no matter what. When they turn off, you can rest. You see that? Up there? We'll be watching you. This is for your own good. Someday you'll understand. And you'll thank me. Gonna get out. Gonna get out. My fucking life. How you holding up, dear? What is this? Jerry said that you needed a friend. His process isn't a lot of fun. But if I got through it, anyone can. You? Well, of course. Everyone here started exactly where you are right now. Edie, this is crazy. No, it isn't, missy. Crazy is hiding an animal where it doesn't belong with no regard for your neighbors. Crazy is poisoning yourself with alcohol and pills to forget your loneliness. Crazy is throwing away your only family for a selfish fantasy. It's not crazy. It's science. Jerry knows exactly how to fix bad conditioning. You've gotta stop fighting. You're just making it worse. It's science. A selfish fantasy. Selfish fantasy. Jerry knows exactly how to fix bad conditioning. Poor baby. The sooner you give up, the sooner you'll be free. The light is still on. Oh, please, no. I can't do this anymore. Please. I just want it to be over. We can end it right now. Oh. Oh, no. No, ple... please. No. I thought you wanted it to be over. Since you won't stay put on your own, we're gonna help you. - Put your hand back. - Oh, no. Please! I... - Put it back. - I promise I'll be good. Oh, no. Please. Please. I just wanna go home. This is your home. This program's very simple. - Face the wall. - It's really up to you how it goes. It's designed to be painful. This is your home. - You've gotta stop fighting. - It's for your own good. - How you holding up, dear? - You comply... - Face the wall. - ...you get rewarded. If you don't, you get punished. - His process is... - ...designed to be painful. - Sarah? - Since you won't stay put on your own... - Face the wall. - Stop fighting. - This is your home. - It's designed... - We're gonna help you. - Sarah. Sarah. Dad? - Is that... - Shh. - How are you... - It's all right. Don't move. I'm here. I'm using the pipes. I never believed their lies. I'm taking you home, honey. All right, get ready. Get ready... get ready to run. Go! Come on, sweetie, you can do it! Yes. Yes, that's it. Come on, sweetheart. I believe in you. You're almost home! Stop. Turn around. Well done, Sarah. I'm proud of you. You were perfect. Both hands clean between the third and fourth metacarpals. She did do a little tendon damage when she pulled them out. You'll be fine. We'll take such good care of you, my dear. Well? Come on. Come on in. What's your sexual preference? Um, men. Heterosexual. Tell us about your first sexual experience. Sarah. Openness is one of the foundations of our community. We don't keep secrets. So, tell us about your first sexual experience. Pay attention. Just observe. See what we're all about. You have to remember what it's like out there. Everybody in their own separate world, on their little devices. Obsessed with themselves. We have to be better than that. We have to be there for each other. Our community has to be strong enough, powerful enough to heal that world. We can't change the world without venturing into it. Once we're ready to handle it. Can you name the four foundations for me? Selflessness, openness, acceptance, security. Excellent. Very good, Sarah. Let's talk about your father. What happened between you two? You never talked or e-mailed anybody about it. Least not that we could find. I caught him cheating on my mother while she was dying. Yes, we inferred that. With her nurse. I said I'd tell her if they didn't stop. And did they? He knew I couldn't do it. She was already so weak, it would've... She died thinking he was a saint. Sarah, do you want to be a part of this community? Yes. Sarah. No. No, I'm sorry, Jerry. I want to want it. I... I'm trying. I promise. Please, pl... It's alright. You'll get there. Let's move on. It's time to start contributing. This way. Modern society is sick. Greed, envy, dishonesty, lust. The vices that corrode society all spring from one source. Selfishness. Well, isn't that just human nature? Of course it is. But we have the technology to change our nature. We... we've had it for decades. Thorndike, Watson, Pavlov, Skinner. All we've lacked is an understanding of what to change to. Until now. Okay. Uh, let's say I wanna become this new, improved human. What do I do? You live by four foundations. First, and most importantly, selflessness. You always act in the best interest of the community. Second, openness. Secrets breed discord. Third, acceptance. Once an error has been corrected... it's already forgiven. Finally, security. We're our best selves when we know our neighbors are watching. Well, fine, but how is the ordinary Joe supposed to become this perfect citizen? It's not unlike childhood. At first, we only follow the rules so we don't get spanked. But soon enough, living the foundations becomes a habit. Then it becomes who we are. And when that happens, we will make of this world a single, perfect community. Free of loneliness, free of poverty, free of strife. Why did you choose me? Because you needed us. I could tell the moment we met. And, we needed you. Everybody here has a role to play. What's my role? Let's see how far we've come. Do you want to be a part of this community? I... I don't know. I think you're ready to take on a little bit more responsibility. Who's watching us? That's none of our business. Eyes back on your monitor. Edie, she's... Esther. How... how do we call Esther? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I agree. Okay, I'll call you back. I'm proud of you, Sarah. What you did for Edie, that's what this community's all about. Edie, is this comfortable? Can I get you anything? Oh, no, dear. I'm fine. Hi, Edie. How are you feeling? Oh, I'm doing fine. I'm so glad that you came. Come on in, my dears. It's so good to see you. Come on in, everybody. Um, maybe I should go. I feel like I'm in the way here. No, I want you by my side for this, dear. Edie asked me to say a few words. When I first arrived here nine years ago, Edie was the first person to introduce herself. As I know she was for so many of you. Of course, back then, it wasn't Edie, it was Miss Stanhope until she told you otherwise. Edie, you have been an essential member of this community for longer than most of us have been here. You have been a great friend, and mother, to all of us. And we're gonna miss you. So much. You can't do this. She can't contribute to the community anymore, and we don't have the resources to take care of her. I... I'll take care of her. Just me. That is not what you're here for. She knows this is what's best for the community. Don't ruin this. I'm so glad you're here. Goodbye, my dears. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Edie. When I got back from Iraq, I was a mess. At first, I thought it was hell. It took me years, but I finally understood. They saved my life. When you let go and embrace this community with all your heart, there is nothing we won't do to make you happy. You probably know what I'm gonna ask next. Sarah, do you want to be a part of this community? Yes. Kneel. I knew you'd make it. Aw. Welcome to the community. Thank you. I told you you'd thank me one day. Come on, let's party! Yeah! Come on! - Congratulations. - Thank you. We're so happy you're here. It's just wonderful. Everybody, can I have your attention? Sarah, I know you've been anxious to know how you're gonna fit in here. Six months ago, we lost a beloved member of our community to cancer. You never got to know Jessica, but the minute Lester saw you, he said to me that you seemed, uh... How'd you put it? "S... smart and kind like my Jessie." Come here, you two. Come on. Come on. Sarah, Lester is as selfless a person as I have ever known. He's gonna take good care of you. And Lester, I know how hard it's been on you losing Jessica. But we all saw how devoted Sarah was to Edie. She's a perfect fit for the community and for you. Y'all are gonna make a great couple. Great parents. Well, go on. Come on. Let's go home. What... what about my apartment? It's not your apartment. It's for new candidates. Come here. Come here. Sarah. We have a problem. Fourth foundation. You know what has to happen. Unless you can make him leave and never come back. Sarah, I need to talk to you. I'm at work. Come back at six. Sarah. He's here. Sarah, you... What happened to you? Are you alright? I'm fine. What do you want? I know, y-y-you don't want to see me, but I... Oh, dammit, I don't want things to be like this between us. You think I care what you want? They're right, you're such a narcissist. - Who-who-who... - You're just so sure this is all about you. You're right. I've been doing a lot of thinking. I wanna be a better father. Fuck you. You're a little fucking late. I've wasted my whole life trying to be who you wanted me to be. Well, not anymore. I have a real family now. Go back to Diane. - Honey, I flew across the... - Go! I don't ever want to see you again. Sarah. I'm sorry. I screwed up. I know. I never should've put you in that spot with Mom. I should have been there for her. And for you. I... and I will. I promise. Whatever you want, whatever your dreams are, I... I'm so proud of you. Sarah? Can you forgive me? I can't lose you, too. I love you. - No! - What? You really think Mom didn't know? You think I wouldn't tell her? I told her everything. She knew exactly what a pathetic coward you are. But... She died hating your disgusting guts. Get the fuck out. If I leave, I'm never com... The next time I want to see you is at your funeral. Okay. Got it. He's gone. You did great. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. We were interrupted last time. Thank you. This is strange for me, too. My first five years, all I could think about was trying to escape. Or kill myself. Jessie, she saved me. She helped me finally accept that this is my life. This is our life. Nothing can change that. But it could be a good life. Hey, guys. You're early. Get outta here. Natty misses you. Why risk letting them all in like this? Jerry has his system. He must have seen hundreds of candidates before he found you. I wish we could help them all. Someday. Thank you so much! I... sorry. - Hey! - Hey! - You got it! - Yeah, I did! I just kept checking the listings. I figured after Sarah's freak-out or whatever, she'd eventually run home to daddy. Yeah, she, uh, she didn't seem too happy here. Well... she was crazy. Looking forward to having your friend back? Mm-hm. Why'd you choose her? Her personality profile matches Edie's. And, uh, we thought that your connection would help with her process. We're gonna save her, Sarah. From an empty, selfish life. First, we need to put her in a receptive state. We need to learn everything about her. I need to cancel my service. Separate her cleanly from her old life. Prepare her to unlearn her damaging conditioning. She'll fight. She's not like me. She's... strong. Don't worry. We can handle her. I said face the wall! Put your hands on the fucking wall. Don't touch me, I swear to God... Hold her down! Let go! You brought this on yourself. Help me! No! No, get off... Hold on to her! Stop her! She bit my fucking ear! Go see Esther. I'll handle this. You were right. She's extremely resistant. This is gonna be hard on her. She needs a friend. Not you, too. I know you're scared. I was too. But everything's gonna be okay. We're gonna help you. You can't keep me here. Yeah, we can. Did you come looking for me when I disappeared? It's okay. I wanna help you. We all do. Jesus. You let them brainwash you. I didn't let... I'm not brainwashed. You're brainwashed. You're a thirty-eight-year-old office assistant. You really think you're gonna be a movie star? They saved me. Lisa, they can save you, too. I'd rather die than end up like you. Sooner or later, everyone stops fighting. You can only take so much pain. Don't worry. Once you accept it, you'll be happy. You don't look happy. - I am. - You don't look happy, Sarah. You look terrified! They helped me. I finally have a family that cares about me. You don't have a family. You just found a new daddy to run your life for you. - Shut up. Shut up. - You pathetic, weak, - spoiled little princess! - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up, shut up! Wait! No, Lisa, wait! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You need to finish what you started. Hold her head. Hold her head! Come on! Hold it. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Hold her still, goddamn it! Goddamn it! No. Now. Please. You don't have to do this. - Shut up! - Sarah! Do as I tell you! Please, don't. Sarah, it's your fucking life. Sarah. Sarah! I can't move. We have to go. Now. Christ, Sarah, you were right. This building does suck. You can't leave. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! - Stay back! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay out of my way. Whoa! Hey! No, no, no, no! Stay the fuck back! Throw it away. Now. How could you do this? How could you kill him? He deserved it. For what he did, to all of us. We can leave. We're... we're free. Get back! I just wanna go. It's okay. It's okay. Sarah, we can't let you leave. You know that. But he's dead. Jerry didn't start this. Who did? I saw his hands, his e... his ear. Who did that to him? Charles Ellerby. But he... he's been dead for thirty years. He gave us the four foundations so we'd be self-sustaining after he died. It doesn't matter who our leader is. The community is all of us. Les, please, look what they did to you. You can leave. Sarah, it's not too late. You're still one of us. No. No, get... get out of my way or I'll... Or you'll what? - I'll... - You can't even say it. You're not gonna... j No! No! Just do it. Please! Just shoot me. Go. Go! No. Who's watching us? That's none of our business.
