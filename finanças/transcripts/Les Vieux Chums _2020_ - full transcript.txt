OLD BUDDIES - Thank you. - Have a good day! - Glad to see you back in town. - Thanks. Hope you won’t feel too lost. Well, where's my coffee shop? It burned down a while ago. The bus station is there now. - Feels empty! - For sure. - And the tobacco shop is there! - Just around the corner. Alright, see you! Welcome back. That'll be $45. On $50. You’re the new owner? It's been five years. Pretty recent. - Thank you. - Thanks. Have a good day. Pierrot? Pierrot Joyal! Our champ! Lamoureux? How are you? - Fine and you? - Fine. - Didn’t know you were back. - I just arrived. - Are you here for long? - We’ll see! - If people still want me around. - Of course! Anyway! If you need a cab, I’m here. Good to know. - Bye Lamoureux. - Bye. I Hope you're not an addict! - No. - Better not! Drugs are not allowed in the house. No weed either, it smells! Same for cigarettes. They're a fire hazard. You can smoke outside. - Is that clear? - Yes. I have this one. $275 a month. One month paid in advance. I got a bigger one in the back, but it’s too big for you, this one'll do. It’s perfect. I'll take it. A girl lives in that room. Marcel in that one. Toilet. Fully equipped kitchen! - Toaster and all. - Perfect. - Made up your mind? - Yes it’s perfect. - Rooms are in high demand! - Yes. - Don’t change your mind! - No worries. How does an artist feel just before an exhibit in Tokyo? Well, listen! I have to admit it flatters me a little. One of Tokyo’s biggest galleries. It’s quite something. But, I’m going there with great pleasure. I don’t have any control over what will happen there. I don't stress with that. All I control is the flame. That’s good! "I control the flame". Great stuff! Listen, I have everything I need. Would you mind if Marc-Antoine took some pictures? - Sure, no problem. - Perfect. Otherwise it’s all good. - Ok. - Awesome. Sorry, one second. Jacques Larose. Pierrot! Shit! What a surprise. Are you in Montreal? Ok. I’m so happy to talk with you! We should get together! Where are you now? No news for six months and you just pop up! What the fuck! I hope you're not in trouble. I can't go before next week. That's what happens when you just show up. Can’t talk right now. I’m at work. No... It’s just surprising. Where are you? Wanna come for dinner tonight? Ok! As you like. Just come after then. Champ? - I'll be damned! - How are you? - Back for good? - We'll see. How are you doing? - A bit lost, without my coffee shop. - Things sure changed around here! Alright then. - See you. - Glad you’re back! See you around! The new neighbour is here! Hi! - Pierrot. - Alanis. Pleasure. I heard Alanis and knew that... the famous new neighbour was here. - Hello! I’m Marcel. - Pierrot. Everyone knows you! I couldn't wait to meet the provincial foosball champion! Ex-champion. That was a while ago. Once a champ, always a champ! Was it five or six titles you won? Six, but the last time, my two strongest opponents weren’t there. No ifs or buts about it! You won six... You won six! That was in my past life! It’s nice to have a champion among us! He looks like he sure can make a good soup. - It smells really good! - I have plenty. Want some? Of course! Oh yeah! You sure know how to get invited! Right here. Quite the shack! It’s the posh neighbourhood. Not for everyone. I think my brother won the jackpot and didn’t tell me. - Keep the change. - Oh! - Thank you! - Thanks again. That must be him. Don’t start anything and keep your comments to yourself. Fine! You told me four times already. There won’t be any trouble. At least not from me. So... How about your coffee shop project? Is it going well? I passed it on to a local guy. I'm back in Québec as you can see. Did you break up with your latest girlfriend? That didn’t work out either. Honestly, maybe you’re better off without her. Lyne, give him a break. He’s not here to be interrogated. - It’s normal for her to have questions. - See? So if it's ok, can you tell us why you came back home? Cancer. Lungs. Which grew metastases that got carried away. Two months, maybe three. Tops. Come on Pierrot! You can't live here! We have a guest apartment. You’d be comfortable. Martin, it’s really nice of you. I’m grateful but... I wouldn’t feel right. I would feel like I’m imposing, to always be in your way. Stop it. I'm serious. I’m trying to save my energy. Just thinking about it stresses me out. I don't need it. I need to know that my big brother is here for me. That I can count on you. That’s all that matters. - I don't want to be a burden. - Fuck! You're not a burden. Lyne couldn’t stand me for more than a day and I get it. I can’t even stand myself. And I’m fine here. They're all very nice people, real people. I'm not playing games. I’ve heard that before. - Still pisses me off now. - Listen... Thanks Martin. Try to understand. Fuck, Pierrot! You’re my only brother... and you’re going to die. There’s a room for rent if you want. You’re such a fucking pain. You were always a pain. - You call me if you need anything? - Yes. Thanks. Good night. - Call me! - Yes! Unfortunately, I must confirm what you already knew. It's way too late to do anything. Except alleviate your pain of course. I actually wanted to ask you... The pain has increased. Any chance I could get stronger medication? Yes... We'll help you out. Perfect. This should do the trick. Thank you. Don't leave them around. We can’t treat this lightly. As I told you, you might feel a little euphoric. Maybe a lot! Depends on the person. Can't wait to see that! Should I not tell my sister? Everyone in town will probably know soon. It’s better if you tell her. But... Tell her I’m doing well. Hi! What would you like? - A tomato juice please. - Coming right up! Holy shit! Hi Champ! - I’m happy to see you. - Same here Jojo. - How are you? - Ok. What’s this? Work accident. I’ve been milking worker's comp for a year and a half now. Come and sit! Right here! You haven’t played yet? You're running out of moves. Very funny. Hi! I'm Anne-Sophie! Pierre. - Everyone calls me Pierrot. - Pierrot. Cool. My cab is here. Continue tomorrow? It'll be your turn. Gotta go, apparently the Zipper can’t zip without me. - Bye. Nice meeting you. - Bye. The Zipper... As in my Zipper? Looks like it. A friend of yours? She's been beating me for two months. I'm getting a complex over it. Down for a game before we get too serious? - Foosball? - Yes. No, I stopped a long time ago. Even better! Maybe I could beat you at last. I've always wanted to! No! I don’t have the strength anymore. I’m saving my energy. How about chess? - I’m tired just thinking about it. - Seriously? You’ve become a wimp. Pierrot! It's for you! You have a visitor! I don't believe it! Hello buddy! I’m happy to see you. So happy! Me too! - You didn’t change much. - You think? Still. Should we catch up? You found a great place! A dream house! I always wondered what this house looked like. It’s very close to the image I had in mind. It’s good enough. The other roommates are so nice. I learn every day. - You haven’t changed a bit. - What? A touch of humility in harmony with perfect altruism. Feeling better? Yes, really. Thanks for asking! This is my oldest friend, Jacques. Hi Jacques. Are you guys down for spaghetti? It’s really nice but... I don't mind, I have plenty of sauce. No, we’re on our way out. - But thanks for the offer. - Ok! You don’t know what you're missing! Thank you. Lose the long face! We all die. It’s just a bit sooner for me. It’s not that much of a surprise. I’ve been a chain smoker since I'm 12. I was kind of asking for it. It’s a known fact. Smokers start dying at about 50 years old, and it rarely goes beyond 70 years old. I may be in the low average but... I smoked twice as much as anyone. I'm still lucky when you think about all those years that I was drunk as a skunk. I thought you had a hunch. Your dad didn’t tell you? What does my dad have to do with that? When we met two years ago in Morocco, I was sure he guessed I was sick. Wait, you’ve known for two years and did nothing? Yes, but it wasn't as bad. It was different then. Listen to yourself! What should I tell you? That's how it is. How is your dad? I don’t know. I haven’t talked to him in two years. I think it's not that dramatic. I’m no longer scared to die. My anger, my rage... I went through all that last year in Morocco. I wanted to break everything. But now it’s... It's processed. You know, accepted. Filed. I finally realized that I didn’t love life enough when I could. And when I started to appreciate life and to hang on to it... It was too late to change the process, to consider chemo, all of it. You have to face it. And I did. The doctor prescribed me new pills. And Julie's brother said I was gonna feel good. I think he was right because I feel a bit spaced out. I'm gonna be high for the rest of my life! And I talk, I don’t stop talking! I'm usually quiet. Right? When we're together, you’re the one talking. Now I'm like a walking motormouth. I’m glad to be back. Cancer will force you to get ready to die. I get to see my hometown. I’ve missed it way more than I thought. I’ll clean things up with my notary, with my brother. With Victor, I hope. With my exes. Going full circle. Close the book. Check. Damn. Shit. Pierrot, you should play. - I'm sure you can beat her. - You're at another level. I told you, I don't play chess anymore. Afraid to lose? A sore loser like your friend Jojo? He just doesn’t want to play, that's all. He might be too old for chess. Speak for yourself. With your job, you must start to feel like a grandma. Listen here, Jojo. I’m 32. With my apartment buildings, I can retire in three months. I don’t care what the likes of you think of me. Relax. It was just a joke. I’ve never been to the Zipper. - I should go see you dance. - You better not! If I see you there, we’ll never play another game. Anyway... I don't go to the Zipper. But Pierrot... he used to be a regular. He'd go there before I was 18. It must have changed. You should come check it out. So! Another one? Will I faint in there? No worries! A little odourless piss. It's reassuring. I'm not taking any chances. You don’t want to go there after Alanis. Oh boy! Your roommates sure aren't boring. They’re really fun. Alanis is the first Native I met. And Marcel, well, he’s hard to beat. He’s my biggest fan! Last night, my sister-in-law asked me why I came back. I didn’t want to explain everything but... Something special happened in Morocco. I was fishing... and I ended up with a fish in my hands. It’s really hard to explain. To be there... with this fish in my hands... It’s as if... everything became clear in my mind. In a split-second, everything became easy, simple. I wasn’t scared to die. The anger was gone. It’s tough to explain. Like some sort of awakening. I knew I wanted to come back to Québec. When I think about it... I think I wanted to come back to see people I loved, like you. It might sound corny, but it’s like... Like I wanted to reconcile with life. Go back over what I did well, what I didn’t do so well. I know it won’t make a big difference, but... I don’t know... I'll do it as much as I can. It makes total sense to me. Don't get mad, but... I would like to see your dad. In his own way, he’s been very important to me. I know, you don’t want to see him... but maybe you could arrange this for me? Give me a ride maybe? - What a nice surprise! - Hello! Hi! Hi Gilbert! Good to see you again! The two old buddies! I'm glad to see you together! Come! We'll go sit inside. - Jacquo! - Don't call me that, I’m fucking 50 years old! - I'm 50 and everyone calls me Pierrot. - It’s not the same. No one calls me Jacquo and I don’t want them to. Okay, sorry, it's an old habit. It's just that I read your article on the painter Spaziuk... - It's Spazuk! - Spazuk, yes. It’s really good, well written, interesting! Like everything you write. Let's go inside. I’ll be along after a smoke. It’s simple. No matter who we are or where we come from, we all have a role to play on this Earth. And this role, more often than not, becomes clearer near the end of life. I’m convinced that... your death will serve a purpose. It will help someone to live better. Death teaches those left behind about life. For Chrissake! It’s not easy to learn to live. But death helps us better understand. As for myself... Only when my wife passed away did I find the strength to start over. Well for myself, mom's death just pissed me off. Just pissed me off! Like Pierrot's death will piss me off! Your fucking theories! All that nonsense, new age, peace and love bullshit! I fucking hate it! Your place is so nice. Just beautiful. You can put this here. I put two free-range chickens - and nice organic vegetables. - I appreciate it. A real pleasure to see you again. Same here. - Bye Gilbert. - Bye. Thanks! Take care of yourselves. I'm so done! I can’t listen to him anymore. Knows it all, understands it all, always has a solution! I always liked talking with your dad. I always got a lot out of it. I heard that one before. My friends always telling me how lucky I am to have such a great dad! I don’t give a flying fuck! I understand, it probably wasn’t easy. No shit! All the same, being 25 or 30 years older sure gives you a great head start. More books, more knowledge, more experience. Thanks for setting this up! I’m sure his comments will help me. Very happy for you. What's going on? Maryse saw Pierrot at the hospital. No, no! It’s not possible! He has cancer? - He has cancer and no one told me? - Listen Amina... - Am I dreaming? - We're waiting for the test results. Stop it! Please stop! You’re lying to me! Maryse read his file and she says Pierrot will die! - My Pierrot will die! - Listen to me Amina! No! No! I don't want to listen. All I want is my Pierrot! I’ll take care of him! Why didn’t he come see me? Tell me that! Why didn’t he come see me? When he comes to Québec, he always comes to see me! - He didn’t even tell Carole yet. - What? What? Carole! Who cares about Carole? I’m his wife! Carole is just his son's mother! - I’m the wife he always loved! - Listen! Please listen! You broke up 13 years ago. I've got news for you: he had tons of girls before you, and more after! You were a perfect mother to Victor. Full of heart! While I was being a fool. I really put you through a lot. Don’t exaggerate, I wasn’t a martyr. Wait! Let me finish. I just want you to know... Thanks to you, I’ll leave with peace of mind. Thanks to the choices you made, for Victor, for yourself. - It brings back memories! - It’s been a while! I’m surprised you never got out of the stripper phase. It’s different with her. She's like a friend. She’s a friend of our friend Jojo. Lucky Jojo! I always liked the feeling of strip clubs. Some sort of refuge. I can be in my own bubble. The female body in motion is so beautiful. I realize that I still like it. It's not like I hate it. Anne-Sophie is pretty. It’s hard to argue. She reminds me of Isabelle. The best tits I’ve ever fondled. I’ll remind you that those were my girlfriend’s tits before you stole her during my trip. Those are teenage stories. It didn’t take long to figure out you can replace a girlfriend in a few days... but you can’t replace a childhood friend. Sorry, that came out wrong. Every time I saw Isabelle, I always felt something. She'd give me butterflies. Me too. Maybe we missed out on the woman of our lives. Speaking of women of our lives, the woman of your life paid me a visit. Amina! Amina! Damn! I never wanna see her at my house again. Crazy bitch! Sorry! I should have thought this might happen. She slapped me so hard it still hurts when I eat. Hi! Hi! Last time I saw you, you were 11. I wouldn't have recognized you on the street. I would have... but I don’t know why my mother insisted I meet you. Come, we’ll talk. I told him to call me back. He doesn’t call back! It’s not his style. He called you once when he wanted to see you. Now what? He can't run his own errands and needs his friend to play messenger? Not his style either and you know it. He didn’t say anything. It bothered him - and he couldn’t do anything. - As usual! He never finishes anything. - Fucking retarded teenager! - Hey! - Show some respect for your dad. - I spent my whole life wondering if I had one. Never there when I needed him. Always hammered, on a trip... - or chasing the next girlfriend! - Let’s spare the details. We all have issues with our dads, including me! But when your dad calls to see you, the least you can do is show up. Better not be to introduce a new girlfriend! It’s up to him to tell you why. Pierrot! Joe! Call 911! - What happened? - He just fell! Pierrot? Pierrot! I guess... I’ll head back to work. - Thanks Anne-Sophie. - Rest well. Thanks. You look like crap. How are you feeling? Glad to be in my own place. Get the light please. How are you doing? - It’s been a ride since yesterday morning. - That's not how I planned it. - Are you too tired? Should I let you sleep? - No. I feel like I slept three hours. Shit. You know... I blamed you a lot for being gone. Your notorious binges that would end in bar fights. I was always torn between... the love, the admiration I had for my dad, the poet, the bigger-than-life bum, and the egotistical, heartless guy you were. But I wouldn’t have traded you for anyone else. You were the only dad for me. It’s as if in your own way, you taught me everything. Even from afar. It makes no fucking sense. Have you lost your minds? He can’t stay in a shit hole like this. - I have a nice apartment. - Uncle! You know him. He's fine as he is. - We need to respect his choice. - Some choice! It’s going to be fine. Jacques and I will take turns. Try to understand, it’s not against you. He even said to call you first in case of emergency. I still think it’s silly. Call me if you need anything. Sure. Uncle Martin gets our plan. I still think you didn’t need to rent this room. You got better things to do than babysit me. Seriously, I could have managed. Yes, we know but... We gotta catch up! You were gone for so long. I pitched my publisher a series of articles about life in a small town. He loved it! It’s pretty! It sure is a nice town! I saw you at the hospital. A small hiccup. Cigarettes, my friend! Yellow fingers! Among other things. Yeah. Bye. Should I pick you up later? I might walk, I’m not sure. I’ll call you if I need you. - Ok. - Thanks! Hope it won’t make you sick. Still a bit cynical? Do you remember our Cuckoo Pact when we were 18? You were right. The metastases are affecting your brain. Those stories were cute when we were teenagers, but reality isn't so cute. What are you saying? You want me to smother you with a pillow like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest? Have you lost your mind? You think I could suffocate my oldest buddy? That’s not how it works! Forget it... It just crossed my mind. No big deal. No big deal? It is a big deal that you thought I could do this. As if it's nothing. Don't get angry, I got it. Let’s not talk about it anymore. We better not. It's just that... I’m no longer afraid to die. I’m not afraid, it’s just that... - I could have used some help, but I get it. - Are you kidding me? I don't wanna die in a hospital bed. Their Medical Assistance in Dying Law is nice but it’s not my style. I’m not gonna wait for that. I'm not asking anybody's permission. It smells good in here! Want some? We have too much. Jacques lost his appetite. No need to ask me twice! Hi! Hi! Slept well? Like a rock. Not me! Not even two minutes. Yeah. - Victor told me the bed wasn’t... - It has nothing to do with the bed. I was thinking... Could you tell me what you had in mind last night? Forget it... It’s just something that crossed my mind. You can talk about it. You piqued my curiosity. I’m losing my strength faster than I expected and I don’t wanna end up in a hospital bed. What did you have in mind? I don’t know... I was thinking of ways to go without too much pain... Not cause too much trouble. Such as? I want to go die in Morocco. Go scuba diving, if I'm strong enough. But I can’t do it alone. Checkmate! Told you I hadn’t played in a while. And I hadn’t won in a while. You just gave me a huge morale boost! Oh boy! Watch out Anne-Sophie! Jojo is back! I've been meaning to ask you... What became of your lovely Sylvie? You were attached at the hip, but Pierrot hasn't seen her yet... Are you hiding her? We broke up. She left me shortly after the accident. I started drinking again... She didn't accept it. I'm sorry. You were together since college! Precisely. We laugh but it's not funny. We’re not doing so great with women. Clearly. I missed a step! - Let's go to my room. - I missed it! But I did! I didn't mean to. There’s people! There’s people! Pierrot! Don't let me down as well. Me... Am I a fucking loser? - No, for real! Am I a fucking idiot? - No. Tell me what you really think. Tell me the truth. You... You’re older than me, you travelled... You saw the world. I mean, you understand a lot of things. And still I don’t understand why you ask this. You were my best guy on the paper route, always on time. I could count on you. Plus you’re a great guy. You’re in a rough patch but it’ll pass. You... You were a fucking good boss. I mean it! I'm telling you, you were my best boss ever! - Good times! - True! I was with my Sylvie! My pretty Sylvie... I need my girlfriend. My Sylvie, fuck! My beautiful Sylvie! She won't talk to me! She doesn’t even want to see me, fuck! We loved each other! I love her so much! Hi guys! Doing well? - $5 please. - Here. For two. - Have fun! - Thanks! - Glad to see you back on your feet! - A bit wobbly though. - Pay me two dances and I'll fix you right up! - With pleasure. I'll even give you a third one for free. Gotta buy a dance to get her attention. Getting old means losing your game. See you later. I find Anne-Sophie inspiring. The other night, I dreamed of Isabelle. I’ve been dreaming of her every night for the past week! I passed by her store... - But I didn't enter. - Oh damn! Let’s shake things up boys! A little $5 gets you on stage! Who's up? Thank you buddy! What a nice surprise! Hello! You came to talk about Pierrot? Sorry, it’s just that... What story did this idiot tell you? You used me to get closer to her? Since I'm back, he won't shut up about you. - He even had erotic dreams about you. - Oh boy! You didn’t tell me! He also won't tell you that at 17, we agreed you had the best tits in the world. He’s delirious, pay no attention, he’s on medication! Julie’s brother did give me really good pills! I always feel a bit high. But looking at you, I understand why he’s so infatuated. You aged better than us. You two aren’t bad either. I'd still have a hard time choosing. See Jacques? You still have a chance! Seriously, how are you? No drama. I lived the life I wanted. No remorse. No regrets either. I'm ready for what's coming. With some drugs, so I don't suffer too much. I only regret having let a beauty like you slip. But I console myself thinking that Jacques might take the spot I missed. Again with the delirium! He might be right. See, since I let go of two amazing guys like yourselves, I never found a guy that came close. Are you saying we all failed our lives? Thank you. I was glad to see Pierrot. I think he was happy too. Isabelle. I wanted to tell you, even if it’s a little embarrassing... I agree with what Pierrot was saying earlier. But I want you to know that... it’s not the only reason we loved you. You’re the most wonderful girl I’ve ever met. I wanted to tell you... As usual, you can count on me. Let's go to Morocco. You're sure? Only one condition. You talk with Victor first. If he doesn’t agree, I'm out. As for us... We need a good plan. Don’t wanna go to jail. Ok. We’ll need to hurry up a bit, I feel... I'm losing my energy. I fear soon I won’t be able to swim. Ok. I'd play alone with my toy soldiers in the sandbox. I'd read Spirou, Tintin... Never playing or talking with other kids my age. Your grandma sent me to a shrink to see if I had a problem. I had one, but they never found it. I changed schools. That's where I met Jacques. He was a leader in the yard, in the class, everyone listened to him and spoke with him. One day, he decided to be my friend. It changed my life. I was part of the gang. I was accepted. I was heard. Even if I still had a hard time communicating, with Jacques, everything seemed possible. There was nothing we couldn't do together. He got me out of my shell without me realizing it. As I got older, I've created this armour. I’ve created an image. Cigarettes, yellow fingers, it was all part of this image. I was already a bit exotic but with the foosball, it went pow! I became a star. I played the part without noticing it. Then the image took over. It was nothing like how I felt inside. I always felt wrong. I always felt off, except with Jacques. He didn’t care about this image and took me for who I was. Didn’t expect anything of me. I’m saying this for two reasons. The first one is... If I understood this earlier, maybe I wouldn't have cancer. I could have corrected the course. This might help you. I don’t know. The second reason is Jacques. The impact he had in my life. Slept well? So well! It was... a night full of tenderness. I’ll never forget it. Jacques! How did you get to Montreal? I borrowed Jojo's car. Are you serious? Are you crazy? You can barely walk, you’re always half high! - At least consider the safety of others! - There was an emergency. Amina. Listen. I had to see her. It’s important for me. Dad? I don’t know what’s going on. I think I’m delirious. You were sick. It’s done, it’s in the past. Thanks. Don’t worry about it. I never imagined I could be happy to clean my dad's shit. It doesn’t bother me one bit. Take care of yourselves. See you in two weeks. - Bye. - Thanks for everything. - I didn’t have time to explain... - It’s ok Jacques, no need to explain. Pierrot told me everything. And frankly... Wouldn't wanna be in your shoes. Takes a lot of guts. More recklessness! Bye. Thanks for bringing me back my man. I didn't do anything. Really happy for you Jojo. Farewell Champ! Thanks! Gotta go. Bye! Goodbye. We’ll miss your soups! Take care. Take care of yourselves! I was afraid I missed you. It's nice of you to come. Didn't wanna miss you. I'm blessed to have a big brother like you. Thanks for everything! I'm sorry for everything. I hope you’ll understand. I always understood everything. You know that. That's why I love you. We'll stay in touch. Are you sure about this? I have a hard time walking, I'm hurting everywhere, even with the pills. I started to be delirious and to shit my pants. I might lose my mind any day now. Yes, I'm sure. I wish it could be different... but I don’t have any choice. Doesn’t mean I don’t find it difficult. - Your friend Abdel? - Yes. - He knows? - About the cancer, yes. He's suspicious about our plans. I wrote to you. You didn’t have to come. I wasn’t going to let you ride a cab for two hours. - Jacques, I presume. - Hi Abdel. So what did they say? Nothing. Nothing I didn’t already know. There will be no remission. It's all set. Sorry, it’s a bit steep. Through the back is more discreet. At least it's picturesque. This is my house. I’ll show you later. You’re ok Pierre? Yeah. Abdel! Oh yes. I've gotten slower. Almost there. This is your house. Pierre knows this place. Go ahead. Thanks. When Pierre and I first came here, there were very few people. Trailblazers! This might be the biggest mistake of my life. I’m telling you, I’m panicking. I said it. I feel like an idiot having agreed to this. Was all this a test? Were you trying to see if you could count on me? Not at all. I never had any doubt that you'd say yes. You're the only one I could ask this and I knew you'd say yes. Don't get me wrong, I didn't ask just for fun. It’s nice to see you're here for me. I needed this proof of love. And even if it’s not a test... It may have been, in the back of my head. Cancer, death... It’s kind of scary. You ask yourself questions, worry for your pals. I asked myself if I could help you live a better life than mine. I noticed. I have a feeling this is not going to teach me a damn thing. I’m a fucking idiot to have agreed to this. I wonder if this is what a real friend should do. Fuck! I can’t believe I jumped into this without raising more questions. Didn’t think this through. I like to think you did it for love. Friends don’t ask questions. It’s normal to be scared. Everyone would be. You bet I’m scared! Shitless! Jacques, this is how we always lived. Freaking out... and overcoming our fears. Taking risks, daring... We were scared, wanted to run, but ended up doing what we wanted. Together, nothing could ever stop us. Yeah. Together! Hello gentlemen! Slept well? I’m going to my store. Still want to come take a look? Yes. Pierrot looks like a guy who wants to be alone. It’s funny to hear people call you Pierrot. I’ll stay here, I’ll rest a bit. See you later. You know, I think Pierre, or Pierrot if you prefer... He enjoyed his foreigner status in Morocco. Here, compared to the Americas, Canada for example, we don't try to integrate foreigners. We let them be. Nothing is expected of them. As long as they are respectful. And Pierre, he loved to live by his own rules. That’s for sure. That’s why he loved living in this house. - He really lived there? - He sold it just before he left. He found it when almost no one lived here all year round. Told you we were trailblazers. We've created some sort of momentum. - Look at this one. - Yes it's huge. - That'll be delicious. - Really? I’ll fix you up something amazing! - You’ll remember it! - I don't doubt you. I would've stayed philosophy teacher if I were you. The sea, fishing, it doesn’t appeal to me. You didn’t grow up with the sea. It's not the same. I like having people around. Some fishermen know as much about life as the great philosophers I read for years. Here, I have... a status somewhat similar to Pierre’s. I’m the guy who doesn't belong. It gives me some perspective. A bit of distance. This distance you need to understand some of life’s mechanisms. It helps me a lot in my writings. I’ll have to hang up, but... Yes. Take care Victor. I love you. So! Victor says hi. How is sonny doing? He’s... He's... He's fine, under the circumstances. He'll get used to it. I'm glad I made peace with my son. It sucks that it took cancer to get here, but at least... I managed to get some of my failures as a dad forgiven. I think that for him too... It allowed him to sort some things out. - And to understand better. - Yes. Making peace with your dad gives you a new outlook on life. I see where you’re going and we’ll stop right now! Ok, fine. It’s just that Jacques... has issues with his dad as Victor has with me, but for different reasons. Like I had with mine. Like everyone! We can have the same problems, at different degrees. Exactly. Jacques' dad is hurting, as much as Jacques, - even if he won't admit it. - You'll make me cry! Remember when you told me it's easier to replace a girlfriend than a friend? Imagine a dad! Listen to me. I didn't come here to get lectured. If that’s your idea, I'll take the first flight out. - Come on friends, let’s not get angry. - Don’t worry. It’s just that... Jacques is a bit stressed out. A little touchy on some matters. Can I finish my story? Maybe I was misleading. It must be the medication. You think you're so funny! It's an inside joke. He keeps teasing me on my medication, telling everyone it makes me delirious. Oh well, he might be right. I had noticed. - I noticed... - Seriously. Seriously. You don’t know how often this guy saved my ass when we were kids. He'd come even if he was scared. I remember this one time. This goon Borduas and his gang wanted to kick my ass. His dad didn’t want him to but he still came, it took three seconds. In three seconds he calmed everybody down. Outstanding crisis management! Expert diplomacy! - He lost his touch with time. - Fuck you! I admit I was proud of myself. And you were not alone. You probably don’t know this but your dad saw everything. He was parked in the Picards' driveway proudly watching his Jacquo. - He was hidden there? - Yes! He told me this himself. I didn’t remember this at all, but he did. I’m telling you, it's not easy being a dad. You got that right. Jacques. I might look in control, but... Without you, I never would have made it. I’m scared too. The closer we get, the less I feel like it. I’m really happy you’re here for me. It’s like nothing has changed after all those years. I’m really happy you're here. And I know it’s not easy for you. Thank you. Good night buddy. Hello! Slept well? Not really. I was delirious again and I shat myself. Change of plans. What? We're changing plans! What do you mean by that? I can’t wait anymore. The letters are ready. Abdel will get the boat ready, I can't wait. - I’m not ready for this, I need time! - Jacques! I can't stand it anymore! I just can’t! It's happening now. This is it? It's what I think? It was a bliss to have you... on my path. Thanks for everything. Don’t worry, it will be fine. Alright. I can’t. I’m not able to, I can’t do this, I just can’t. I'm sorry. I wanted to help but I’m scared to be stuck with the last image of you. It's ok. We promised we wouldn’t linger. Just ask Abdel to help me with the boat, please. Ok? Let’s do this before I change my mind. Could you pass me the tank? Sure. Fuck, this is heavy! You don’t feel it in the water. Let me help you. It used to feel way lighter. There’s a strap underneath. - Alright? - Yeah. I'd like to ask you something. If you can’t for whatever reason it’s ok. When you’ll have fun, would you please think of me? And have fun for the both of us? Sure. I also wish you were less bitter. Go back to being the happy guy I knew. That I was happy with. I gotta say, it wouldn’t hurt. You should sleep with our lovely Isabelle. Who aged so well. You're such an idiot. You have to quit smoking. Give me one actually. Thank you Jacques. Pierrot! Pierrot! Fuck! Not like this! Not like this. Pierrot! Shit. TO MY OLD BUDDY TO MY OLD BUDDIES TO MY FRIEND SAÏD
