The story and the characters in the film are fictional Dad. I told you not to come here. Go home. Hurry. Original book by SON ARAM Directed by KIM SUNG-JE Today is important. What's the situation like? YOON GYE-SANG YOON GYE-SANG Rooftop mob is throwing firebombs. We're giving out warnings. Okay. You set to shoot water to the rooftop mob? KIM OK-VIN We're all set. Start as soon as you're ready. Those freaks keep throwing. I repeat. Today must go off cleanly. THE UNFAIR Step back, you mutts. Put on your helmet. Dad. This way. When can you finish the door? The resistance is too strong. The contractors alone won't hold up. Darn it. Send in more backup. As soon as you get done, head over to the church. I see a few protesters there. Shin-woo, stay there. Wait there. EXCEPT FOR THE 1% CAPITALIST CLASS, THE 99% WILL BE EVICTED Hey. Get out of here. We'll all die. Are you crazy? You mutts! Get lost, scamps. Give them warnings. Avoid fights. Maintain amenity during the arrest. There has been an accident. What accident? Someone at the church was hurt. Who the hell did it? Pardon? Inspector. The channel is closed. SITUATION ROOM Pardon? Okay. Hey, stop them! Don't give in so easily. It's too early to settle. I've told you many times. The most critical fight in a lawsuit is the endurance fight. Of course. Trust me. Talk to you later. This woman is so antsy. Things aren't working out too well. It happens when both parties have affairs. The noodles are mushy now. I can't eat this. That piece of crap. This is the photo of the Northwest side serial killer suspect. Parents with daughters must be terrified. -Don't you have a son? - Yes. Even if he should be punished. They can't reveal his identity like that. I'm sure Amnesty International will do something about it. The media has gone crazy, right? Forget the media. Care about me. If you don't want to work, move out of my office. I never said I won't do it. I need time to think. You want to poke around until there's nothing left. Am I a sitting duck? Who said to sue the insurance firm? What's wrong? Don't you like a free helper? If you're gonna brag about it, don't do anything. Frankly. Your academic background sucks and you lack experience. 2 years as a public defender for a law firm? Don't overrate yourself. This sweet and sour pork is good. Did they get a new chef? Try it Don't change the subject. You know what the cash cow of a Chinese restaurant is? It's not the main dish. It's the noodles. For us, the cash cow is divorce. Forget the main dish. Stick to noodles. If you're unhappy, lower your standard. Yes, sir. Don't answer me so halfheartedly either. Peons like us, we go with noodles. How odd that a law firm looks for a public defender? I guess the court hasn't contacted you yet. Last month, an accident occurred during the riot. The one about an evictee killing a policeman? The evictee's son was also killed by a thug contractor. The court has appointed a public defender to Mister... Mister... I'm sorry. To you, Mr. YOON Jin-won. Here. Someone like me will do whatever the court says. PARK JAE-HO CASE Someone like me will do whatever the court says. Citizen Action Group? That's the evicted residents' group. We gave legal advice but can't defend them in court. GWANGPYEONG LAW FIRM Your LEE Gwang-pyeong lawyer works pro bono. He can't help much with this case. Anyhow, it's a fact that PARK Jae-ho killed a policeman. Tell him you're a lawyer and he'll like you. He can't help much. I guess so. Gwangpyeong. Even the business card is in gold color. Good luck. Who knows? It looks like a case they've thrown out. You know who LEE Gwang-pyeong is? During his prosecutor days, he married a rich man's daughter. But when he started his law firm, he made so much money. He got a divorce and married a really young girl. Jealous? Yeah. He's so dam lucky. You've applied to Gwangpyeong, right? Why do you keep using my toothbrush? - What a neat freak. - I'm not a neat freak. A toothbrush doesn't get clean from washing. Anyway. Good luck. Who knows? LEE just might love you. You dirty crook. PUBLIC DEFENDER YOON JIN-WON I've heard from your representative. But I'll confirm again. Do you want a public defender to take your case? I want to be declared innocent. Until you're proven guilty, you're innocent. The law states that. So that's why I'm locked up here. Normally, a murder suspect is not granted bail. Where're the scamps who killed my son? KIM Soc-man'? The security contractor. He's also in jail. Those sons of... Not the security contractor but the policeman.” A policeman? Do you have a witness? I'm the witness. I want to sue those rogues who claim that a thug has killed my son. You've killed a man. The only crime I've committed was frying to save my son. Mr. PARK Jea-ho. Do you wish for a public defender? Is that all? Is that all you can say? Is that all? Prior to hosting the Olympics, the place began for all the homeless. Now they're kicking everyone out for redevelopment deal. Were you there at the time? I was on the 2nd floor of an apartment complex. So you didn't see. No. But if necessary, I'll testify. You said you didn't see. You know. We're all here for Mr. PARK. Director. Please don't say that again. That's correct. The media framing doesn't look too bad. Looking at the big picture, we won't have to do much. Okay. Okay. How's it going? The initial police investigation report is trash. Holes. There're many holes. But Mr. HONG is very good at his job. A sage once said, “Cutting off side branches will hurt the core? Which means not to have side branches in the first place. Prosecutor LEE. A tree needs a strong core to thrive. This is an unusual case so don't talk to others. Yes, sir. Who's the defense attorney? Gwangpyeong? It's a public defender. Really? Good. It was awkward because he's an acquaintance. Let's go easy. Yes, sir. You said, the dead policeman's father is the key man. - You saw the video clip. -Ms. GONG. It's no use writing it. The boss hates that stuff. So I need to convince the boss. That's impossible. And if you can see, take a look at the situation. Gwangpyeong has tossed it to a public defender. Public defender? Why? They got the situation. Don't you see? Hello, everyone. “I'm the Commissioner of Police Agency. We've arrested the serial suspect. Geez. That Gwangpyeong bullies. NO CRIME WILL GO UNPUNISHED CASE INVESTIGATION REPORT Mr. YOON Jin-won? There're some problems with this case, right? Excuse me? The victim says a policeman killed his son, right? You mean the defendant? - The defendant? - Yes. I hate that word. These are the contractors. Here are the police. Their uniforms look similar. Nowadays, you can't differentiate them. Scoundrels. You see that the contractors enter before the police do. After 13 min, the police entered. Riot control continues for 30 min. The dead boy, PARK Shin-woo. His father, PARK Jae-ho. This is the contractor. KIM Soo-man. - Get the picture? - Yes. You don't get it. If KIM killed PARK Shin-woo, he should've been arrested at the scene. But he's not arrested. As soon as a person dies, that is a murder scene. But the police continued their operation? You with the evictees? I'm not saying PARK's innocent. Someone's hiding something. It's not a fiction. Sorry. The case investigation report has been sealed. - Sealed? Why? - I don't know. You should ask the prosecutor. According to the Criminal Act Article 266 Section 3 Clause 2, a prosecutor may impose censorship of materials. Mr. PARK said a policeman killed his son. The contractors' uniforms are similar to the police uniforms. Mr. PARK was mistaken. Let's not complicate things. I could request the court for the release of materials. How long have you practiced law? You can't act toward a prosecutor like this. You been working like this all along? Let's go easy. As two professionals. Then please let me view the forwarded reports. As two professionals. Request it to the court. Dam. Dae-seok. Can I borrow your name? Request for adjudication? I don't want to piss off the court. And HONG Jae-deok is the investigating prosecutor. My senior. A real trash. - So let me borrow your name. - So why my name? I'm just an ordinary civil litigation lawyer. And I'm just a public defender. That's right. The court pays your salary. Have you forgotten? That's funny. The judge is KIM Jun-bee'? He's HONG's classmate. The judge and the prosecutor are friends? They're best buddies. PARK says that a policeman killed his son. A defendant usually has his unjust stories. A reporter came to me. The reporters just love those cases. The prosecutor has blocked the investigation reports. Too bad. You're not a prosecutor. Mrs. LEE's division of assets case. Hello. Mr. YOON. Your case file is missing the initial police report. You can be a lawyer now. If you miss it, I would have to go twice. Speak formally in the office. Then you do first. Now that she's big, she sasses me. There're no police reports. Why? I don't have any evidence to file. Dae-seok, can't you help? Where're you going? Where? What's a busy man like you doing here? Coffee. That's the place. Bukahyeon District 2. The city of Seoul has persuaded the evictees and the developer to mediate before proceeding. Mediate before proceeding? Yes. Oh that! Don't you know? Mediation before proceeding. Whatever. You don't know. What is that? Before anything happens, parties involved keep the record of such mediation. It's legitimate but favorable to one party. You've already signed so shut up. Something like that. The point is that the city of Seoul mediated the deal. You're good at fabricating stories about rights and pressure. I'm not fabricating stories. Would anyone of the opposition party be interested in this story? Someone who is friendly to us. And has information from high up. Us? Yes, us. I can't help you officially regarding this case. OPPOSITION PARTY CONGRESSMAN PARK KYUNG-CHUL Its illegal. However. We could mutually help each other. Unofficially. iSure, let's do it./i Hey. Sure. Then, let's do this. Ms. GONG, don't mention my name for a while. We can discuss when to print the news. For this redevelopment case, many people's rights intervene. The constructor is Dorim Corp. REDEVELOPMENT SIGNING CEREMONY Their agreement with the union. The contractors are gangs. You can't beat them. Then something unexpected happened.” The evictees have withstood those thugs over a year. Aren't they great? So what does this party do? They sent a contents-certified mail. Can't start the construction? Then, terminate the contract. The developing cost alone is $3.5 billion. Millions of dollars of the slush fund paid off the union, the district government, and etc. Where did the money come from? You think the builder would hold it in cash? The interest on it is already over $8 million. For some reason, the police started to suppress the riot. It contradicted the guidelines. Because the police didn't negotiate with the residents. Someone important probably helped. They used their influence at the right time. But a kid dies there. It was a pain in the neck. For them, it was lucky that a policeman also died. It conceals the root of the problem. Who helped them? There was this thing. REQUEST FOR NEWS RELEASE OF THE SERIAL KILLINGS THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE A missing persons case went public the day after PARK's incident. Just 3 days after, a suspect is arrested. He turns out to be the serial killer. Are you saying it's been manipulated? No, I'm saying the timing was perfect. You're saying the Blue House has intervened. Even if he committed a heinous crime, it's rare to disclose the suspect's face in the media. Isn't it, Ms. GONG? I'm writing this. Can you? It's all speculation. I've worked in the judicial system for the last 20 years. By then, you develop sort of intuition. Should I tell you about mine? This could be the biggest case of your entire career. The President's Office put pressure on the police. So the police ignored the guidelines and deployed troops. You want me dead? It's an exclusive. You bring up the Blue House without a source? If you don't interview the dead policeman's father, get off the case. Boss. Soo-kyung. A blister will pop when it's time. So stop squeezing it. The end. Get lost. I every Korean reporter writes it, how's that an article? Get lost. Fine, I'll go. Excuse me. Are you the father of the policeman, Mr. KIM Hee-taek? How did the adjudication petition go through? When did YOON graduate? From what school? He was the 41st class from some no-name school. A young public defender walking all over a prosecutor? You'd better wrap it up. Prosecution side. Please proceed. ADJUDICATION PETITION HEARING Are defendants aware that you're charged with manslaughter? Yes. Did you commit manslaughter while on duty? No. No further questions. - Are you finished? - Yes, your Honor. Do you wish to submit evidence? We didn't find any evidence linking defendants to PARK's murder. Does the defense counsel wish to cross-examine? No. How does the Prosecution find the defendants? Prosecution finds defendants not guilty. There's nothing. They've cleaned off everything. Can you even fix it? Wow. This is what's nice about old models. Repairs are fast and easy. BUKAHYEON DISTRICT 2'S REDEVELOPMENT DEAL BEGINS! This case. I'm sorry to say. But this is no case for a public defender. Why're you drinking in the middle of the day? Pardon me. Hello. Mr. JANG Dae-seok, a competent attorney and most importantly, not a public defender. This is Mr. PARK's only ally. Reporter GONG Soo-kyung. I've heard so much about you. You're very beautiful. You're a handsome. Thank you. Have a drink. I don't hear that often. Wow. She can drink a lot. - Here you go. - She has good manners. You're perfect. It's always fun drinking with a beautiful woman. I'll take a shot. Darn, that makes no sense. In front of a lady, swearing... I take that back. This is a murder case. Why would a thug stand in for a policeman? I don't get it. You have experience with State compensation litigation? Yes, three times. Did you win? You crazy? Judges are hard-core patriots. I freaking lost all three times. Dae-seok! What? - Violation of nonfeasance obligation. - What about it? A policeman or a thug whoever killed the boy. The incident happened during a police operation. -Yeah. - The country is responsible. Jeez. The legal terms are so difficult. You people only understand each other. You're a bit drunk. So. Would State compensation lawsuit be possible? Of course not. You know why? You're a public defender. You work for the country. So Dae-seok, you do it. This is different from letting you use my name once. I don't do jobs that don't make money. You know that. What's wrong with you? No. I bet my wrist that it'll be this year's biggest news. - Money isn't the issue. - Congressman PARK said. The media will all jump at it. Just by defending the case, you get free advertisement. It's a State compensation lawsuit. It's a sure thing. I'm happy right now. Free. I'm happy. Let's do an interview. I know him well. He's materialistic but he's a good man. That's exactly what I see in Mr. JANG. A materialistic person. Let's go to another bar. Nobody go home, okay? Did I tell you about my college girlfriend? Kwan-hee. We protested together and kissed. Kissing wasn't the only thing we did. While I was doing military duty, she got married. So as soon as I went to the Judicial Training Institute, I saw a matchmaker and got married. What's there to life? I'll help you. What? I'll support you and your petty lawsuit. Talk to me when you're sober. Whatever. We're on the sacred road that our President has laid for us. I wouldn't dare lie to you. RESUME GWANGPYEONG LAW FIRM FOR 2013 DISTRICT COURT CRIMINAL TRIAL OF CASE 66, | RESIGN AS PUBLIC DEFENDER I haven't decided yet. You already have. Did I drink a lot last night? You talked about your ex again. Let's quit drinking. The claim amount is? 10 cents. 10 Million? 10 cents. A boy is killed during riot control. His father asks for 10 cents. I don't need the money. The country should admit its fault. This is awesome. I guess you're no ordinary public defender. I'm not a public defender anymore. Now the judge can't dismiss it easily. This is enough to draw media's attention, right? Of course. If he dismisses, he'll be screwed. - What difference will it make? - Just one thing. Self-defense. The case's judge and the prosecutor are best buddies. Should we file a motion for recusal of judge? You saw the adjudication hearing. You think it's possible? Judge KIM Jun-bae. His style is. He hates complications. I'm going to dismiss it. You want a jury trial? It must be filed within 7 days. Not in all cases. Would you like to see the precedent Supreme Court case? Don't you trust me? You know as well. Because I'm a friend of HONG? You people. You think it'll affect my judgment? Do I look incompetent? You see the reporters are already on the move. For information on you and Mr. HONG. Are you threatening a judge? Keep a line between the court and politics. *| didn't think the name JANG on the petition was you. I can't believe it either but it happened somehow. So you want to transfer jurisdiction with a jury trial as a decoy. Well, things could be a tiny bit fairer. Watch carefully. They claim that PARK Jae-ho killed KIM Hee-taek. And KIM Soo-man killed PARK Shin-woo. It wasn't the thug. It was the policeman. But what if. KIM Hee-taek killed PARK Shin-woo. Why does the Prosecution Office cooperate? Thank you. Because Dorim Corp is connected to the President's Office. What're they hiding? The investigation reports and the riot control officers list. Why? It's obvious that everything is jumbled. If they try to cobble things together. The answer must be in the scene. No The crime scene is clean. Because it's been cleaned already. Who and why? Well. KIM SOO-MAN The person at the scene would know. I killed him. I beat him up and he croaked. PARK Shin-woo died in the hospital. Who cares where he died? As long as he's dead. You cleaned the scene after PARK was sent to the hospital ? We cleaned it because it was our... During a police operation, you voluntarily cleaned up a crime scene? A murder scene. The police ordered you? Let's stop. Jaws. That's your nickname. Mr. PARK says you're innocent. You didn't kill him, did you? What're you doing? You're better than my lawyer. In the court, I'll argue for your innocence. If I succeed, you'll be set free. Freaking hell. Which police officer ordered you? I don't know. I don't know everyone's name. Inspector. What? Said he's the Inspector. Inspector? Will you testify that in court? - Inspector. - What the hell? - Why do you walk so fast? - I'm no longer a policeman.” I'm a case broker who sells crime cases. Just one hint. Please? I promise to keep it a secret. How can they clean up a murder scene without any investigation? How's that a murder scene? He died in the hospital. I know you have a conscience. Which is why you've quit the police force. The thugs cleaned up. Go ask them. He said you've ordered them. KIM Soo-man will testify that. KIM will testify? Yes. Don't lie to me. 60 witnesses? 1st JURY TRIAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE There're 60 witnesses? Yes. You want to call them all? The schedule won't allow it. Then dismiss the jury trial and submit to ordinary procedure. Are you trying to deter a jury trial? If it was unnecessary, we wouldn't have filed a motion. Condense the list into 10 witnesses or less. KIM Hee-taek's father was on the list of witnesses. Did he consent? I sincerely request. Of course, your Honor. Due to the big number of witnesses. We'll set the trial duration for 3 days. You all know that “this trial costs as much as 80 general criminal cases. It's a cumbersome case. Many are watching. Please bear that in mind. Dae-seok. Geez. What's wrong? You know who came to represent the State compensation lawsuit? Who? Our country as the defendant called for a legal representative of a newly minted Ministry of Justice worker. Not a lawyer? He looks like he could've graduated yesterday. You know what he says to me? Mr. JANG, don't waste your career. The nerd said that. I bet a TOEIC score is the only line he has on his resume. Are lawyers some chess pawns? They think us peons as pawns. Is Ms. GONG areal reporter? She hasn't written anything. She's not the only reporter there. Apologize for murderous riot control. Punish the person in charge. Justice! Justice! Murderous administration. Step down! Step down! Step down! This is an illegal assembly. Please return to your homes. Home? PARK Shin-woo doesn't have a home anymore. Where should he go? He's amazing. He knows what works. I know. He's sly as a fox. Are you really a reporter? Why isn't there any article? What did you say? Justice! Justice! Stop the murderous development. Stop! Stop! Release the detained. Release! Release! Stop! Stop! We'd better go. I told you to send me a photographer. You should've sent one long ago. Wait, wait! -I'm a lawyer. - I'm a reporter.” POLICE STATION You're a lawyer? - Why didn't you tell me so? - I told you that I'm a lawyer. Let's go. Are you okay? Thanks anyway. Let me see if you're all right. What're you looking at? Do I look okay to you? Why're you mad at me? Geez. I'm jealous. In 1988, my girlfriend and I started out like you two. - Mr. JANG. - Whatever. Are you okay? “- I'm okay. - I have good news. What is it? The police made a big mistake. So what? It's nothing big. Of course, it's nothing big. But now Congressman PARK is fighting in his wheelchair. Democracy in this country is dead. POLICE ASSUALT CONGRESSMAN PARK AT A RALLY You didn't know? Whether you knew or not, the police punched her face. She's a reporter. A reporter! Mr. Chief of police. What? So I should print what you've said on the front page tomorrow? Meet up? No thanks. Those scoundrels. Look at yourself. Until the trial ends, you cover the case. You said the story sucked. How could you say that with that face? Kill them all. So... How about something like this? A MAN SUES THE NATION FOR 10 CENTS. A 10-cent lawsuit? The source is reliable and it's an exclusive. Let's pop that blister. ASKING 10 CENTS FOR THE WAY OF LAW NO MORE WRONGFUL DEATHS What's the intention of the 10-cent lawsuit? Did a policeman kill Mr. PARK's son? In the 10-cent lawsuit, the plaintiff's lawyers said about their belief on who is liable. This isn't a problem of thug contractors. I believe the country is liable. The Police Commissioner said. In response to nation's liability being questioned. Then who will be responsible for the death of a policeman on duty? It's all absurd. We're reviewing a defamation lawsuit. Commissioner. Please continue. Let's do it. What should I testify? Did a policeman kill? “I'm certain Almost. Almost? Why did he order to clean up the scene? The person who ordered would know. I just followed the order. Was a cop then and it was an order. Will you testify that in court? I'm a case broker. I live off police information. When I testify in court, I'll be done with this job. I'm ashamed to say this, but... What is it? Please tell us. My situation is messed up. Don't lawyers make good money? I said no. It's obvious that the Police Commissioner was involved. If a money transaction is - I n discovered, we're dead. This is crucial evidence. Whatever. You lied to your mom that you worked late. You don't have money. You pay $5,000 and I pay $5,000. Go straight home. You don't even have $5,000. You can loan it to me. Forget MOON Hee-sung. Those people ruin trials. MOON's testimony alone is better than what we have. If you pay him off, we're finished. Then lets end it. Let's sign KIM's bail agreement and put him on the stand. We have the public sentiment behind us. Cheer up a bit. SEOUL HIGH COURT JURY TRIAL, DAY 1 2013 District Court Criminal Trial of Case 66. We'll start the manslaughter case. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Did you have a good lunch? Yes. That's great. Now, I'll start explaining the case. It was late January. An accident occurred at the demolition site. Due to the assault of KIM Soc-man, the security contractor. Protester Mr. PARK's son, PARK Shin-woo, ended up in a coma. But there was another victim. The death of a 20-year-old policeman, Mr. KIM Hee-taek. Mr. PARK struck KIM Hee-taek who was at the scene on duty. KIM died there with a skull fracture. Mr. PARK would have lost control. Because his son was in danger. Shin-woo was sent to the hospital. But unfortunately, he died. Did Mr. PARK attack a person with an intent to kill? Yes, like you, I feel sympathy. But I dare say this before you. RAISE YOUR HEAD. YOU LOOK GUILTY You don't have to pity him. Because the law pitied him. Prosecution charged him not with murder but with manslaughter. Not murder but manslaughter. It's what we call unintentional killing. The law has sympathy. Thank you. What Prosecution claims is not entirely true. First, it was not the contractor who killed Shin-woo. A policeman did. Therefore, what Mr. PARK did was to save his son. I say a policeman killed Shin-woo. And Prosecutor says a security contractor did. Mr. JANG. Do we have police reports? No. Prosecution has the reports but refuses to submit them. On Mar. 15th, I've requested to view the initial police report. Prosecutor denied. Again on Apr. 21st. I've requested but again, Prosecutor denied. We've asked the judge to unseal the police report. But Prosecutor denied. I still haven't seen the police reports. During this trial, we'll find out what Prosecutors are hiding. The uniforms of contractors and the police are similar. Inside the building was dark and chaotic. Why do you think a policeman killed your son? I've seen those thugs every day for a year. I know every nickname. But I've never seen the man who beat Shin-woo that day. He is not a thug. But wasn't he wearing a helmet? He wasn't wearing a helmet. So the dead policeman, KIM, must've had his helmet off. Members of the jury. We have to remember. That KIM Hee-taek was struck on the back of his head. With this. In other words. Mr. PARK struck the back of the head of a policeman without a helmet. With a metal pipe. I'll say it again. The back of the head. Members of the jury. Is hitting in the back of his head a self-defense? A policeman killed my son. We checked Mr. PARK's criminal background. Previously, he was investigated for assault. He has always settled before he was charged. So I wouldn't call it a crime. You have a violent temper. Don't you? He killed my boy! The policeman killed my boy. What kind of father doesn't recognize his son's murderer? Jury trials are her specialty. She'll have the jury bewitched. She's sneaky. You sure she doesn't have you bewitched? I didn't come here for a date. She's married. The daughter of Hong Institute and Yoo Corp's daughter-in-law. So what? She's married? 2013 District Court Civil Trial. State compensation case. STATE COMPENSATION LITIGATION The amount of claim is 10 cents. Defendant, Republic of Korea. Plaintiff? Where's defendant? SEOUL HIGH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE Are you an attorney? I'm KIM Jae-il from High Prosecutors' Office. A high prosecutor will plead? Where's the public-service judge advocate? Ministry of Justice has appointed us. I was appointed as the representing attorney. You can't file all these today. Plaintiffs attorneys. Did you receive the preparatory documents? No, your Honor. The court will postpone the hearing. We have 12 hearings this morning. We can't do them all today. And plaintiff. Please refrain from manipulating the media. Look at this courtroom. A high prosecutor replaces the Ministry of Justice rookie? LET'S TALK. HIGH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE Don't feel pressured because we're prosecutors. It's hard to do that when a prosecutor is defending. Let's pretend, you got paid your 10 cents. Thanks to the media, you'll become stars. But what's a dime to Mr. PARK? Mr. PARK has agreed to sue. I don't think this case makes any sense. As an individual prosecutor, let me make a proposal. You know the State Compensation Committee of the Prosecutors' Office? We didn't intend to settle. Settlement. We won't leave any form of document. So let's call it a compromise rather than a settlement.” You have my word. Your word. Your honor. Someone must be really scared. Pardon? Now the media has brought public's attention. Some big guns must've gotten scared. I'll inform Mr. PARK of your proposal.” So please tell them. If we decline, they should brace themselves. Excuse us. A petty public defender has threatened the Director of the High Prosecutors' Office. Dig up some dirt on YOON. Find anything. If we don't accept the settlement. The State Compensation... The State Compensation Committee? Yes, Committee. Can we trust them? If they do, are you going to settle? No, I won't settle. Only thing you can trust is always on paper. It's so that we can trust. Do we have a chance to win? I don't know. But we have to fight. Sir. Hello. Disciplinary Committee? It's not impossible. ltd pass the deliberation. Professor YEOM. He's very strict. After he became the chairman, the level of disciplinary action went up. I'll be fine as long as I follow the rules. Anyway, Director. Let's play golf sometime. Mr. YOON. Here. MR. YOON HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO APPEAR AT THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING PETITIONER: DIRECTOR OF SEOUL DPO CAUSE: INJURY TO DIGNITY You two haven't met, have you? This is Mr. LEE Gwang-pyeong, attorney-at-law. I heard you're having trouble with a difficult lawsuit. We should've taken the case. We're grateful that you care about us still. Thank you but I'm doing my best right now. Right now, Mr. PARK needs the best lawyers. I know you're sent before the Attorneys Disciplinary Committee. Mr. YOON. I'll keep my stance even when you can't get jobs as a public defender. Let's call it a type of guarantee. A type of guarantee? Prisoner 8509 refuses visitation. Don't worry. We have many attorneys who served as judges. How's getting arrested at a rally, an injury to dignity? It's the works of Prosecutors. HONG Jae-deok. That cheap crook. How can Director Prosecutor be part of the disciplinary committee? - Does that make sense? - It does because this is Korea. That's not important. After Prof. YEOM became the chair, many lawyers were reprimanded. Depending on the decision, his license could be suspended.” But YOON was his student. Half of all legal professionals in Korea were his students. He doesn't have friends. He's a cold-hearted old man. Geez. How did LEE know about that? They're all in it together. Now the case is famous, they're tempted. Darn it! The alleged fought with the police on duty. It was an act of injuring the dignity of an attorney. I recommend that he receives disciplinary action. DISCIPLINARY HEARING Was the alleged attorney charged with a crime? He was released with a warning on the day of the incident. No, sir. Not to mention no charges. But if the police didn't even start the investigation, how did you find the photos? Did you carry out a targeted investigation? I feel that the prosecution is abusing the disciplinary tribunal. - We'd never do that. - Why're you here? I'm a member of the committee. You certainly knew that. “I know. I'm well aware of it. But during my term, have you once come to a disciplinary hearing? You never came. Why did you come today? Mr. Chairman. Please maintain your impartial stance. You're the petitioner. And not the interested party. Correct? Of course. This is not a courtroom. You didn't press charges today but applied for a petition for disciplinary actions. Correct? Yes, sir. So I only need to be impartial to the alleged attorney. Yes, sir. Since you know so well, let's make this short. Let's deliberate. How much do you get paid for a case? It depends on the circumstances. Let me put it this way. How much do you want for this case? You need to tell me the truth. Can you do that? Let me ask you first. To a lawyer. What does it mean to hear truth? Lying is easy. But it's hard to defend a lie. Then ask me. The discovered bones. Did you kill him? You have to speak so loudly? Only us here. There're ears everywhere. How is it? Are you up for it? JO Gu-hwan, Defendant, pleads guilty. But your Honor. The statute of limitations on the case is 15 years. The crime was committed in 1993, not in 1997. Therefore, the statute of limitations has run out. Prosecution filed LEE Pan-soc missing in 1997. The year JO bought the land that he abandoned a corpse was 1996. Circumstantially, it's impossible. The prosecutor is correct. My client solicited to murder and concealed the corpse. But the legal burden is placed upon the prosecution, to prove that it wasn't 1993. You're a piece of trash. You won. Me? You screwed the prosecutor. By the way, why did you pick me? You paid a handsome legal fee. So I did. Let's have dinner sometime. Excuse me. Do we have more to say? I'm sorry but. I have to ask favor for Mr. PARK. Tell him I'm busy. Give me this one. Why're you avoiding Mr. PARK? Because the case is over. Over? It's natural that more people want to control Mr. PARK now. Don't be a sissy. I bought a car. The new one. Great. I know. That's great to buy a car with dirty money. Good for you. Dae-seok. Why did you become a lawyer? Why did you do it? I thought you'd never settle. I'm sorry. Citizen Action Group said. It's better to go with a firm with many former-judge lawyers. But it's so hard to meet Gwangpyeong lawyers. I know it's too late. But will you take my case again? This is a normal visitation room. So the visitation is short. I'm not your lawyer now. Mr. YOON. I know you're a good man. No, I'm not. I hope you win. Is that all? Is that all you can say? Is that all? Is that all? Your son died. You should've spent years chasing justice. If you lose at the district level, appeal to the High Court. Then to the Supreme Court. If all fails, you should've gone to the Constitutional Court. What're you doing now? If I were you, I'd never stop. Until I crush someone, I would've fought fill the end. Until I crush someone. Until I crush someone. Your time is up. Mr. YOON. I'll fight till the end. Until I crush someone. Until I crush someone. What is this? The attorneys have changed every month. What're you doing? I'm sorry. We had our reasons. Your Honor. Wouldn't a public defender be more suitable for Mr. PARK? 2nd PRETRIAL CONFERENCE OF JURY TRIAL Each time the attorneys change. Defendant's legal position becomes murkier. Are you going to change again before the trial? If there is, speak now. No, it won't happen again. We're Mr. PARK's attorneys and will be from here on. Okay. Let's begin. Mr. KIM Soo-man. Mr. KIM. I'm certain that I summoned him. Mr. KIM's attorney. I'm sorry. We couldn't get a hold of him since yesterday. What? This is absurd. Is this why he bailed? I'm sorry. I'll find him before the trial. I fine Mr. KIM $3,000. Unacceptable. You're good. You're very good. Well, I too would've chosen a similar path if I were you. It's better to bet it all than to remain a public defender. But I didn't think you'd make this case so big. It'll be a fun trial. I don't argue a case for fun. This will be the biggest case of your career. That is if you win. But do you think you can? I won't know until I've done it. Must you do it to know that? Please take a look around the audience. Is there anyone you might call a child? What is that? You're a witness. I know but. “I'm confused to be asked to find a child. You're confused. Anybody will be. I think it works. Yes. - You have an appointment? -No. - We're closed now. - We're having a meeting. - They're in a meeting. - Excuse me. I said you can't come in. Who are you? All the newspapers are writing about this case. Have you had dinner yet? I heard that you know KIM Soo-man. He's an okay guy. Even though all thugs look the same to attorneys. Where's he now? Hae-soo. Mr. KIM. I didn't Kill him. You didn't kill the boy? Whoever it was. I didn't kill anyone. Then why did you say you did last time? Because the big man told me to. You made a deal with a prosecutor? Why're you telling me this now? My boss is arrested. And the company is finished. Media is poking around the case. So they pinned the guilt on them. My loss is incalculable. Your loss? I've asked you last time. Why did you pick me? So I paid some money. But why did I pick you? I see. You own JC Security Company. I'm still good at picking out people. Will you testify? We don't trust prosecutors. As you probably don't trust us either. Thanks to the police messing up, the country is in trouble.” You're helping the country right now. Excuse me... Can I trust you? Hey, I'm a prosecutor. Okay. I see. This is wiretapping. Will it stand in court? It's not illegal to record your own conversation. But the probative value of evidence will be limited. If I were the judge, I'll never grant the motion. Why not? He'll say, “The jury will react too emotionally? But that's an excuse. If this goes out, HONG's career as a prosecutor will be finished. Isn't it only fair that he's punished? If I were the judge, I'd never want my colleague to die off. Because we're all in this together. Let's not submit this evidence early. Let's sneak it in on the last day of the trial. The judge will decide to grant or deny the motion. It's a 50-50 chance. What do you mean, 50-507 The evidence is clear. That's the law. Jeez. Where're you going? I have to go write. Just wait. You want the judge to decide on this trashy truth? But you promised not to write. I'll mention the plea bargain and hide the source. Ms. GONG. Are prosecutors stupid? They'll know it's from us. You said it's a 50-50. If the judge denies it as you've said, this becomes nothing. The issue isn't the article. This is a matter of the court. People outside of the court have a right to know this. If you print it, HONG will... No, the whole army of prosecutors will just sit and watch? It's my decision to write. Soo-kyung. Soo-kyung. Let go. Your article is unfavorable to Mr. PARK. My article is unfavorable to Mr. PARK? Don't you mean to your defense? What's the difference? Why do you care about an article so much? Did you come here to get a measly scoop? Hey. I'm a reporter. Let's be honest. You have the recording the newspapers are talking about. I need to listen to it. Where is it? It's in my office. I'm stunned. When will you submit it? Tomorrow? You people think that if you submit evidence like this, I'll just accept it all? Bring it right now. Is he prohibited from leaving the country? Get the recording. Bring KIM Soo-man. Go get him, asshole. You talk too much. - One ticket to Yaniji, please. - Yes, sir KIM Soo-manl! Darn Hong Jae-deok! What was the condition at the time? He was unconscious from a depressed skull fracture. His heartbeat was irregular. Can we assume the assault caused his death? Yes. As an expert, what kind of assault do you think it was? It was an assault with a weapon of a curved surface. According to our medical examiner, Shin-weds direct cause of death is not from the assault but a depressed skull fracture from the fall. You two have different opinions. I disagree. What's the witness's specialty? I majored in orthopedics and am now a professor there. That's impressive. But the medical examiner majored in forensic science. If your specialty is the treatment, the medical examiner's specialty is post-mortem. In this case, doesn't the medical examiner have more expertise? Objection. Sustained, rephrase that. Nothing further. When Shin-woo was brought in to the hospital, was there anything important to note? He had a piece of flesh in his mouth. - A piece of flesh? - Yes. Exactly what kind of flesh? Skin of a human. It looked like the epidermis of a hand. Was anyone treated for a bite on the hand around the same time? Yes. Who was that person? He was a policeman. Please raise your right hand. You have a big scar on your hand. How did you get that scar? I was bitten while on duty. Did Shin-woo bite you? I'm not sure who it was. Did you assault the person who bit you? No. That scar looks bad. But you didn't fight back? Yes, he came at me so fast that I couldn't feel the pain. So a boy bit you for no reason? Like a mad dog? If you put it that way, yes. That's correct. So you just admitted that a boy bit you? Objection. Leading. The witness has just changed his testimony. According to the Criminal Procedure Code a leading question is allowed in this case. Overruled. So please tell us. It was a boy who bit you? No, I'm not sure. Did it hurt? Yes. So what did you do? I didn't hit him. I didn't ask if you hit him. By the way, you really didn't hit him? I-.. I didn't touch him. I was just bitten. Is it true that the person you didn't hit is a child? - No, I don't know. - Yes, you do know. Of what age, do you consider a person, a child? Is a 30-year-old, a child? Objection. The defense is asking for an opinion. Overruled. Witness, please answer. No, a child is younger than that. Please take a look at the 3rd row of the audience. Is there anyone there you'd call a child? No, there isn't. There isn't. There isn't. The people sitting on the 3rd row are those who were arrested near the church that day. GOO Jae-hwan, 42 years old. HA Myung-nam, 50 years old. KIM Sung-chul, 40. KIM Hyun-young, 40. LIM Hyuk-soo, 51. CHO Chul-goo, 49. And here, Mr. PARK, 48. Surely there isn't anyone whom you'd call a child. Because the only child on the site that day was Shin-woo who came to see his father. Wait, I didn't hit Shin-woo. I thought you didn't know Shin-woo. -You sure? - No, I didn't hit him. I didn't hit Shin-woo. I hope so too. Nothing further. Mister, this is a brand new bag. There're no papers in there. What're you doing? Long time no see. JO Goo-hwan is also suspected of tax evasion. Someone took the books. Here's the warrant. This is locked. Please hand me the key. Break it open. That's trial evidence. Oh, the famous Mr. PARK case? What is trial evidence doing here? And that's the order of the 27th Dept. I have the 12th Dept.'s order. A valid warrant. - If you take that outside. - Then what? Are you going to sue a prosecutor? Don't let the lawyers contact KIM Soo-man. Are the prosecutors idiots? Do you realize how difficult you made this trial for us? You don't own this case. Don't talk to me like this. Listen carefully. The person who can save Mr. PARK is me, not you. The lawyer not the media. When I first came to you, you didn't even believe that a policeman killed Shin-woo. You're not the only one who's trying to save Mr. PARK. Is it so hard to say sorry? Okay. Don't come near my trial. Do whatever with your scoop. MG BANK I've wired the money. Please check. See you tomorrow. JURY TRIAL, LAST DAY I feel sorry that we failed to prevent violence. After the accident, did you order to switch the radio to an unoccupied? I said I didn't order anything. Then who ordered? Not me. I think there has been a problem. I don't get involved with fieldwork. A person died during a police operation. And mere contractors cleaned up a murder scene. But you have no clue. By any chance... Did the President's Office get involved? - That is absurd. - Not a tall? - That's correct. - Really? Would you read this paragraph? What's wrong? Should I read it? Refrain from mentioning Mr. PARK case. Publicize the serial killing case. Disclose information such as the suspect's photos. To create media content. From the Secretary of the President's Office. What is this? These are just guidelines. It's not mandatory. How many times did you issue press release of Mr. PARK's case? That's outside of my responsibility. One time. It was distributed once right after the incident. We're the police not the media. During the same period, there were 11 press releases of the serial killing. You made 3 announcements in person. Can you still say that the police is not a media agency? Did you call me here to confirm if we're the police or the media? I'll ask the witness. Where did you receive the situation report at the time? In the situation room. How do you switch the radio frequency? Switch it to another channel and encrypt it. So where do you control it? In the situation room. Oh, the situation room. That's odd. You asked for who's responsible through the occupied channel. After that, you received the situation report undisclosed. And the radio control is done in the situation room. So let's see. You were in the situation room at the time put didn't know the radio channel was switched? I don't know the technical aspects. There's a person who is in charge of that. The officer switched it without your consent? Commissioner intervened in the radio communication.” Who the heck did it? Then the occupied channel was disconnected. After that it was done over an undisclosed channel. I got the order on my cell phone. What was the order? To clean up the scene. You quit the police force after the incident.” Yes. Why did you quit? I was ordered to write a crime report. What's wrong with that? I was ordered to write a lie. What kind of lie was it? That KIM Soo-man has assaulted Shin-woo. Why is that a lie? Because I didn't see it in person. Who ordered it? It was the police commissioner. Nothing further. You work as a case broker. Is this true? Yes. A former police officer and now a case broker. You know that it's illegal? Objection. Prosecution is badgering the witness. Sustained. Counsel, rephrase it. Yes, your Honor. Your brother filed for personal bankruptcy last month. You stood surety for him and already spent your severance pay. How do you manage your household right now? Objection. Calls for an irrelevant answer. I'll decide whether ifs irrelevant or not. Mr. MOON Hee-sung. Did you receive a payment “from the counsel to testify in court? How much did they pay you? Should I read that aloud? This is... How much did the attorneys pay? $10,000. - But that's not why I'm testifying. - Really? Then what's the other reason? I'm trying to tell what I've seen. You weren't there. What did you see? About what I've heard. You heard that a policeman killed Shin-woo? No, I didn't, but. - I was aware of the situation. - What situation? The situation that a person was aware of who wasn't there? Yes. Would you be here if you hadn't received $10,0007? But... Nothing further. Would the defense like to cross-examine? Counsel. We have KIM. Keep the rogue under wraps. Watch out for the reporters. Did you get it? HONG ordered to ban KIM from leaving the country. He must be really pissed. KIM Soo-man. That is our last card. I don't know whether the judge will grant it. He'll grant it, 100% sure. Despair makes cowards courageous. They'll even bite you. Okay. To the court, please. Dam. Let's go to the court. All rise. Please take your seats. Good afternoon? Let's continue. Prosecution will... Your Honor. What is it? We'd like to call our last witness. I believe you don't have any more witnesses left. It's KIM Soo-man. KIM Soc-man'? Is he here? Yes. Objection. KIM is wanted by the police. An offender can stand as a witness. You were hiding a wanted person. - This is illegal. -No. We just found him. After the trial, I'll deliver him to the police. If he's guilty, he'll be put on trial. Your Honor. He's the defendant of the same case. And not eligible to stand as a witness. Prosecution has agreed during the pretrial. Ill allow it. KIM Soo-man. Did you assault Shin-woo at the scene? No. During interrogation, you said you killed Shin-woo. It was a lie. Why did you lie? The prosecutor told me to. Objection. So. What is your objection? What? Overruled. Continue. So you falsely turned yourself in because of his request. That's correct. Why did you comply with his request? He threatened to charge me with violation. And? If I took the fall, I'd get 3 years and be put on probation. I see. Is the prosecutor in this courtroom? Who is that prosecutor? Nothing further. Prosecution may cross-examine. Aren't you going to cross-examine? Mr. KIM. During interrogation, under no pressure, you admitted that you've committed murder. Why're you overturning your confession now? Why? Don't you know? Only answer the question given. You order to ban me from leaving the country. Mr. KIM. Mr. KIM. I you lie under oath, you'll be charged with perjury. I know that I'll be charged with perjury, if I lie under oath. But there's a recording that I made. No such thing exists. Nothing like that exists. Your Honor. I submit the recording as evidence. Your Honor. The evidence was not proven substantial. Counsel. I said I won't accept any evidence that is not substantiated. I couldn't. Prosecution came and took the evidence Is this true? Your Honor. This is a duplicate. It can't be submitted as evidence. That's correct. A duplicate is not admissible evidence. But the prosecution seized is the duplicate. This is the original. Let's hear it. Thanks to the police messing up, the country is in trouble.” You're helping the country right now. What happens if I say, I killed him? You'll be charged with manslaughter, not murder. For a under 3 year sentence, you could be put on probation. You can also request bail. Excuse me. But can I trust you? Hey. I'm a prosecutor. I'll do it. That's good. So let's practice. Okay. Did you assault Shin-woo? Excuse me? Get it together. I'm sorry. That's enough. Turn it off. The court can't decide on the authenticity of the evidence. So the court will defer the decision to grant the motion. Counsel, cross-examine. Jury No. 8. Do you have a question? Please fill out the questionnaire. JURY QUESTIONNAIRE The jury is asking questions to the prosecutor, not to the witness. So it's not appropriate. But in order to utilize aim of the citizen participation, the court will read the questions. Did you, Prosecutor HONG, ask for a false confession? Prosecutor is not obligated to answer the jury's questions. I refuse to answer. Please be quiet. Let's have a break. So you crushed HONG in the end. I was just defending Mr. PARK. I wasn't trying to crush HONG. He should be crushed. And when a reporter starts feeling sorry for someone, one cannot write articles. You're a reporter. And I'm a lawyer. I swear to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth under pains and penalties of perjury. Your son is the late KIM Hee-taek. Yes. He was on duty as a conscript. He said if he applied to conscripted police force, he can take the police exam as a special employment. I see. Are you aware that Mr. PARK has killed your son? I am. Do you resent him? Yes, I resent him. Probably for the rest of my life. First, I'd like to express my deepest condolences. Do you wish for Mr. PARK to be punished? Sitting in the audience, I thought hard. Why is my son dead? Because I know who killed him. But I want to believe that the man killed my son under some unavoidable circumstances.” Because “that man's son died before his eyes. Nothing further. Sir. Some unavoidable circumstances... Think about this. Mr. PARK is claiming self-defense. You understand? Pardon? Yes. Then you understand what that means. I don't understand the question. It means he's not admitting his fault. Understand? Do you believe your son has killed Shin-woo? I don't believe my son has killed anyone. My boy is not that kind of person. But they're claiming that your son assaulted and killed Shin-woo. Objection. You're humiliating your son with his killer's words. Is that the right way to show sympathy? My boy would never do such thing. But I don't know what happened. Because I wasn't there. If my son killed someone, it was probably an accident. An accident. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They're taking so long. I guess the jury is split. Dae-seok. That voice pen wasn't the original. Who can tell the difference? Suddenly, I got up and started babbling. JANG Dae-seok. You're awesome. You know how grateful I am to you. I'm grateful for hooking me up with this case. One of my big brother's best friends was in law school. When I was in high school, he came over one day to our boarding room. We ended up living together all summer long. Maybe because he was sorry for freeloading, he tutored me. I thought he was so cool. I probably owe him for having graduated from even a local law school with my grades. But my brother told me later, that his friend was wanted by the police. Stupid democracy movement. Just a peon lawyer, now. Main dishes don't make money. The noodles do. Right? That's right. 2013 District Court Criminal Trial of Case 66. I'll deliver the verdict of the manslaughter case. The jury has accepted the defendant's self-defense plea. But the jury's verdict only has an advisory effect. Court will deliver its ruling. Court rejects the defendant's self-defense plea because he committed a crime and the severity of the assault. But the Court will take defendant's unfortunate circumstances” and investigation process into consideration. Under the Criminal Act, a crime of manslaughter is applied. Court will exclude the aggravating factors and hereby sentences Mr. PARK to 3 years in prison. Get out. We'll all die. Are you crazy? Freaking mutts. Dad. Shin-woo. Shin-woo. Wake up, Shin-woo. Shin-woo. Let's go home. Wake up. I'm sorry. Help. Please help. You have anything to say? A word, please. Mr. PARK. I am a sinner. Because I've killed a man. We continued to appeal. But people have moved on to new cases. We lost the State compensation litigation. The demolition continued. Homes have disappeared. The town is gone. Court dismissed. Mr. YOON. Our offices are close. Let's get together sometime. Sorry to say that I can't say sorry. It wasn't your fault that I quit the Prosecution Office. I have many people helping me. A private lawyer life isn't so bad. Yes. I bet there're privileges of the former post. There was no conspiracy. I did it all by myself. I see. Listen until I'm done. Do you think someone gave me a call? Don't kid yourself. I don't work like that. A nation is about some people making sacrifices, and some people providing service. A nation is based upon that. In other words, Mr. PARK made the sacrifice and I provided the service. By the way, what have you done? What the hell do you know?
