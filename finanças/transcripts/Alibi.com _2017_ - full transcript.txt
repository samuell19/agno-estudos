Darling ... Voicemail again? This is my 10th message! Where are you hell are you? I'm with my parents. Waiting for you. And it's my birthday! I hope you have a good excuse. Damn! Damn! Dammit! Dammit! -Hallo? -Pierre? Paul Edward here. I'm screwed. -Did you screw her? -Yes. You must help me. Damn! What should I do ??? -I may have a solution. -Go ahead, I'm listening! But I want a compensation. -Are you serious? Steven? Yes? Please when you are about to leave, be careful that you don't wake the children. - Yeah ... yeah, yeah. Did you get it? How do I solve it? I'll give you a number to a business that will save you. What business? I'll kill him! I swear on my mother's life! Sorry, Mom. -Miss, your fiance is a hero. -What happened? He sacrificed himself to save Timmy, a blind boy's dog. It ended with a night in the hospital and a broken phone. You can be proud of him. And I yelled at him. I'm sorry. I'm a monster! Forgive me. I'm sorry, darling. How are you? And see. Now he can enjoy his day without worrying. And thanks to us. Bravo. Brilliant. Your appearance and success with women inspired you to create this business? That's nice, but no. When I was 10 years old my mother caught my father. He never fully recovered. My father was sorry and I suffered. If she didn't catch them, none of this would have happened. Your CV looks great. Impressive. Only one question. -Why don't you stay anywhere for more than 6 months? -Routine makes me bored. I'll never be bored in your business. Pardon. Yes? He will be always late for work. Why? Imagine how much time he takes just to gel his hair. Then you will have to start earlier. Anyway, Your profile is interesting. If you want, you're welcome here.

This is our motto. -Francoise! How are you doing? -Excellent. -Here you go. -Thanks. See you next week. -Francoise, beware. -Your blouse is the other way around. Thank you. -Who would like some pastries? -I do. Great idea with the cooking class. But now you have a stain on your skirt. Piglet! Some say that our company is immoral. Wrong. I don't think it's good, but of people are doing it. We just do not want them to suffer, Protect them. Adultery is not the main thing among our clients. These are the typical colors for Pont-l'Abbe, yellow and orange. This is Romain! Yeah, darling. -Peek a boo, baby! -Good evening, Jacques Martin. -Good evening, Romain! -Still at the office? Yeah, don't even start. Our boss moved the meeting for next morning. Start without me, I might join you for a dessert. Can't you free yourself up? Otherwise you'll miss the photos of Pont-l'Abbe, from the Museum of the Bigouden culture. Oh no! What a pity! I have to go. I have a work to do. Hugs to all of you. -Bye, dear! -Bye, Romain! Great, it was good. Super! Super! -Should I leave it here? -Yes. How long will you stay with your mother? Until Sunday. You know how she would like to see you. The whole weekend in the mountains with you and your mother. No, thank you. As you wish. -Hello, Mr. Godet. Is everything alright? -It could not be better. Excited like a fly on cow's ass. -Good day, Mr. Godet. -Good day. How are you ? -Bon voyage, Mr. Godet. -Thank you. So, Vegas ? Better than bingo at the local church. Your toll tickets all the way to Albertville. -Here is some local cheese and salami. -Thank you. -Why does he keep winning lottery secret from this wife? -Because his divorce isn't final yet. Hello. -Allow me to introduce Clara. -Hello. Is it good? Yes, good. Continue, continue. -Are you here, baby? -Yes, I am here. -Did the promo turn out well, darling? -I am so done.

What are you doing later? -Can we go out for a drink? -I am sorry. I am engaged. I was not talking to you. I told you it's over. You knew that a serious relationship is nothing for me. All right. How about a little music? Again Greg's playlist. I'm so sick of the 80s. You don't know anything. It was the best decade. -It's delicious. -Thank you. Greg, can you stop? -Why? I need to talk to you. What's going on? What's your game with Mehdi? Don't start again. Have I ever betrayed you during our 20 years of friendship? Stop being jealous. We are, after all, a team of superheroes. You're Batman, I'm Superman. I know, but the Muslim has never been a member of our team. Stop with that. Come on. Well, come on. See? Everything okay? -Any more questions? -No. Yes. Why did you not stay with Clara? It's a lovely girl. I'm not in love with her. You say that everytime, because you're traumatized by your parents. It prevents you from falling in love. Does not, I just cannot. You have something to talk about, you are still a virgin. The only vagina you saw was your mother's. I am saving my flower for the soulmate of my heart. -That's something else. -You did not dare. Yes. Life is not just video games and superheroes ... Guys, are you serious? These are the things that makes me disgusted. Such as this. Gross! Come on, mate. Go. Lookie! Lookie... Lookie! Oh no! I should have tie him better. It's a playful puppy. It's unnecessary to fell guilty. It was not your fault. I should have taken him along when I needed to pee. But when someone is looking at me, I can't pee. Well? Well what? He croaked, your pooch! And that's good! I cannot stand those beasts. It was a joke. I am joking. The pooch is fine! A bump and a brokentooth. He can go to Roland-Garros (French Open) tomorrow. Damn, this is good! Would you like some? It'll kick your ass. -And you, blondie? -No, thanks. No fun with the two of you. Come tomorrow and pick up your mutt. Bye. Okay ... great! What a relief. I do not know how to thank you ??. Meal? Money? BJ? Excuse me. When I'm stressed, I say vulgarities. It is nothing. In addition, I'm not hungry. Alright? Yes Yes. Okay ... -I have to go now. -All right. -Thank you for accompanying me. -I am Florence, Florence Martin. -Gregory. Gregory Van Huffel. -Nice to meet you. -You too. Well, we dropped off Clare. Are you okay? I'm not sure. -ADD. Invitations sent -Hello. -Hello. I came on behalf of my married friend. He met a young lady and he would like to spend a weekend with her.. He would like to know whether you can help? -I understand. What is your friend's name? His name? -Jean Claude. -Jean Claude. Good. Tell your friend we can easily manage, that we will provide an alibi with a double. We will send someone to pretend to be him in his place. His double will use his credit card and show up where he needs to be. At the same time we will give another cad to Jean-Claude with which he can pay anything, without it turning up on his bank statement. -I understand. Where would like to go ??? -Here. -The Cannes. All right. Savings of 70%. Your friend likes to save, eh? I do not know. Well then? -All right. I will give you a form for Jean-Claude. so that we can come up with the best alibi. See you, Jean-Claude. See you ... yes. Lookie is much better. He would invite you for dinner to reward you. That was for you, Lookie. -An unusual place for dinner. -You thought it was a date? Not at all. Facebook says that you are taken. Cute, he spied on me. No, that status is strategic. Otherwise I would get a lot of requests for friendship. Don't get fooled. I was not hitting on you. I wanted to know about Lookie, simply as a friend. Be so kind and take him for a minute. So what else do you do other than bowling and peeing in the woods? -I'm a lawyer. -Lawyer? And that means? I work with law. I hate cheaters and liars. -And what do you do? -Me? I... I.. I am a flight attendant. Great! Sorry. Seriously? Jean Luc Lahaye as a ringing tone? Don't tease me, I like him. So what? Your turn, stewardess. -Stewardess! You are going to get it! -You? Do you want to bet on it? -I bet on whatever you want. -All right. -Break. Down. -Stop, it is not fair. Turn around, because the bet. Come on. Coward! No one will call me coward! Strike! Yes... It is not possible! Let's see. I won. Apparently, he's better, right? It's fine. Yeah, better ?? s. -We are going? All right? Are you satisfied? -Totally! -My dress ??! -I have not had this much fun in ages. Cool. You make fun of my ringtone and yet you watch movies with Van Damme! Bloodsport is the best movie ever. And my biggest frustration. I could never manage his kick while turning. Great life! Do not be disrespectful. No my fault you are not good in bowling. I hope there some things you are better in, because this time you let me down. All right. Get up! -What? -Up! Who laughs as first, gets a slap. Good. No, you can't ... You lost. Will you take me home? Easy on the gas ... Greg -Now! -I so want to see it! Excuse me. Flo didn't tell me the cleaning woman comes today. I'm her mother. I understand. From Flo. She'll be here in half an hour. Great. Sorry. It is not... Yes. No, I more so than you. Oh, stop. -Me too. A kiss. -Hello! Charlie? What are you doing here? I told you I'm not a babysitter. I do not want to go school, they all tease me. In one month, you had the flu, appendix, lost both grandmothers, what more do you want? Let's say I have menopause. Mother doesn't work since her menopause. Come back in an hour, we will give you something. Well, go. But this is the last time. All is well. The car is shiny. Thanks, Mehdi, but it was not necessary. Are you joking? You cannot see your in-laws with a dirty car. -Are you going to in-laws? -Yes. -Nice that I learned it. -You did not know? I'm sorry, Augustin. I was so stressed, I forgot about it. It will be alright, mate. There is nothing that can happen, nothing worse than what already happened with her mother. Hey Dad! I introduce to you Greg, famous cop - steward. Greg, my father. -Hello, Jean-Claude. -Gerard. Gerard, forgive me. Come inside. Gerard, did you touch my picture? It's always lopsided. -Darling! -Hi, Mom! -Good afternoon, Marlene. -Good afternoon, Greg. Today you are dressed. That's good otherwise your father might feel inferior. -Why did you set the table for five? -I invited Maurice. Oh, the entertainment will be taken care of. Poor guy. He got separated recently. She cheated. Everyone knew except for him. Horrible. -Really. -Now everyone thinks of him as an ass. He became a wreck. Unpleasant. Wreck! I am here. I'm sorry, Maurice. I did not hear you come in. It's OK. I brought a small a gift. It will go nicely in the living room. You should not have. It's you Marlene. I spent on it more than 352 hours. -More then Gerard. -Now ... I'll bring the wine. You coming with me, Greg? -I brought some wine. -A real wine. -I can go. - No, that's good. Come. Flight attendant! How dare you lie to my daughter? Is that a joke? And you? Jean-Claude? Let's settle it. It's not fair to Flo. -No settling of anything! -Sorry. -I'll cancel the contract then. -Under no circumstances! I said no, Gerard! Fine. No worries. Thank you. It's better, healthier. -Yes. We will be honest and say to Flo what your job is. -Not! Please. - But it's healthier. I just do not know whether she will manage to forgive you. Her last boyfriend got dumped, when he cheated at Monopoly. -So I have no choice? -I don't think not. -Did you blackmail her other men? - No, you are the first who was introduced to us. -Where was it? -New Delhi, in 87 For "Doctors Without Borders". -Such memories! -Lovely. Truly brilliant. -Is that you, Maurice? -Yes. With my son and wife before she cheated on me. -Your son? -Yes. There was a million to one that we would have a black baby. And we were lucky. There were some who win the lottery, we had a black baby. -And who is this? -The mayor of the village. Very nice. We were there every year. That year we met with Gerard. We danced a lot. At that time, we were like Jay-Z and Beyonce. Those years are long gone. On Saturday, we have our 30th wedding anniversary.. Gerard is not going to be at home. Really? Pharmaceutical seminar in Beauvais, poor soul. Oh well, responsibilities... It's okay, mum. I will be with you. Greg is going to Tanzania tomorrow. Let's see our lovers. If you wish, I will come and encourage you. No, no need, Maurice. It will be a ladies' weekend. I too want to show you a few photos. -Do you want to live together ??? -Yes! We found a great flat. I hope we reach an agreement. I am very happy. You didn't say that I am the first man whom you introduced to your parents. I did not want to scare you. I'm sad that my mum is so depressed. She is so bored since she retired. And she will be all alone on her wedding anniversary. Poor mum. -Try to entertain her. Yeah, you are right. Have I told you already that I love you? -No. -How silly of me. I do not want to be alone through the weekend. Welcome to the seminar, Mr. Martin. Enjoy your stay in Beauvais. Sweetie, this message will reach you when you land in Tanzania. I hope you had a good flight. I miss you. This is it ... This is it. It is far from it. Yes, Gerard? What's with the credit card?

He said 1000 Euros? I am willing to add to the account, but control yourself. You can rely on me. You can rely on me. - Champagne! For whom? -For Kiki! No... No... -I still do not have any like of the video. -Really? Very effective. A bit strange. It's great! -But there are more views than yesterday. -Maybe because we are looking at it now. I feel like quitting. I'll never get through. What are you saying? Do you know what age was Funes, when he became famous? I do not know the singers of your era. (*Funes is a famous actor, not singer) Come on! Let's have more champagne. -We had enough for today. -But not for drinking. At least I'll be in a good for the first time. Hello? Room service? We would like Dom Perignon in our room. What? How is that you do not have any? At those hotel prices? Scandalous! They have none. I think I'm dreaming! Do not worry, I'll go and buy some in town. -Thank you, my darling. I'll change into something much more casual. -Flo! Ae you going to open? -I'm coming, Mom. I'm in the bathroom. I just talked to Maurice. He just fed Lookie. I hope the dog doesn't become depressed also. The receptionist recommended Beach Zelos for tomorrow. It is quite nice there. I did not dare wear my swimsuit, I gained weight. Relax. If you were like father, I'll understand. -Did you talk to him on the phone? -Could not reach him. I'll try again. Surprise! -What are you doing here? -We have a wedding anniversary, right? -And your seminar? -One should have priorities right in life. -How did you know where we are? -I left a message on his answering machine. So ... I see, a message. Your outfit is part of the surprise? That shirt is really very pink! You found a very nice hotel. How did you find it? Thanks to you, you left the hotel page open on your computer with a super discount too. -I wanted to make mum happy. -It's good you did. Where is your suitcase? Oh, don't start on it! They lost it at the airport. -What a pity. -Yes. -Really bad luck. -Yeah ... bad luck. That is Greg! My love, how are you? All right. Finally we arrived. How are you, honey? Great. I took a trip this weekend with mum. Great! This will make her feel good. And look who's here, who came to see us. Hey! Hey! Hello, my little Greg? How is Tanzania? Thank you, good. It's fantastic, in Tanzania. There are a lot of....zebras. -Will you send me a photo? -Yes, of course. -Now just you and it would be perfect. -I would also like to be right there with you. I am looking forward to seeing you on Monday. -Me too. -I am already dead tired and we have a poor signal. We'll talk tomorrow? I'll let you be with your parents. I was about to show you my breasts. Bad luck. Good night. Sweet Dreams. Bye, my love. What is this mess? I don't know. They are in the same hotel as me. I probably left the page open on the computer. - Where is Cynthia? -In her room. What should I do ??? Flo asks tough questions. I have no suitcase, no wedding ring. And where is the ring? -At home, under my briefs. We will bring you everything. Gerard. She is coming! I have to hang up. -Hello? -Cynthia Belinni? -Yes. -Hello. This is police. Please note that Mr Gerard Martin was jailed for public drunkenness and assault on public figure. I'm not surprised, he was drinking all day. I'll note that. We will leave him here. When we release him, he will call you. -Can I visit him? -No ma'am. This is police, not a hospital. OK, fine. A kiss. -So? How does it look? -We've got a little problem. The alarm is turned off, but there is a hallway camera. -So we have to turn off electricity. -I was ready for this eventuality. I'm going for it. -Not You will stay here. I will take care of it. You are still in training. Well, I'm here. I cut the wire. Mission accomplished. Greg, I cut the lines. Well, I will arrange this. You'll stay here, Greg. I'll smash a window. I don't want to hurt you. -Alright? -Yes. -Try one more time? -Later. The keys are in the flowerpot. You pack his suitcase. I will take care of the ring ... All right. We are going. -Is this police? -I do not know. Hide! Lookie? That's Maurice. He came to feed the dog. Here you are. Your food. Come on. Let's hide. Now what? It's been a long time since the two of us were alone. Did you miss me? I also missed you. I love it when you are looking at me like this. We feel so well together! Yes, good. Yes, my darling. You are so beautiful! Nice that we meet again. You're little naughty girl! Yes. Have you seen my beast? Damn! -Augustin, did you take care of that jeweler? -Yes. -But it was close. -All right. Will it go well with the clothes, hotels and business cards? Yes, done. All that remains is the bloody photo of zebras for Flo. -I do not know how to do it. - Oh, damn! -What is it? -Nothing. Something I forgot. -What did you forget? -Nothing. Nothing. Say it. All right. I have a small problem with narcolepsy. -And I take medication. -Really? Supposed Mr. Perfect! No problem. At the nearest rest stop, you get some coffee. -Will you be okay? -No problem. Since when do you suffer from it? Mehdi! -Mehdi! Mehdi! Wake up! -Mehdi! Mehdi! Mehdi! Mehdi! It is insane! -Why did you not say anything? -I wanted to have the job. That is why I never lasted anywhere and I do not want live with my mom anymore.

Have a nice day, Sir. -What are you doing here? -It's the same thing I could be asking you. Honey, promise me that you don't say anything to your mother. -Mrs.Martin? - No, this is my daughter. Look, do you think you mother will like it? I was not sure. Are you joking? It's beautiful. It must have cost a fortune. Really? But why are you following me? I thought you are going down for breakfast. Shall we meet downstairs? -Now she should leave you alone. -I hope so. Otherwise she'll never forgive me. -It is really that expensive? What's the price? -The price of your guilty conscience. Here's your wedding ring. I put a label XL Airways on the suitcase. The aim is, to get you far away from the hotel.
