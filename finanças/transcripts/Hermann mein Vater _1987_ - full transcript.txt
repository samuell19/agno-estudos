1944, on the morning of June 6th. German occupying forces in France defend their Atlantic fortifications against the vastly superior strength of the advancing Allies. In vain. In these bunkers all the soldiers will die, buried in the rubble that collapses all around and on top of them. My father wasn't one of them. Not any more. My father is still alive. You're still alive, Father. You learnt French and France has always meant a lot to you. Can you tell me a little bit about what France means to you? Yes, I like the country, the sea that almost surrounds France. And the French people. Their way of life. Their politeness. HERMANN, MY FATHER You also used to read French books. Pardon? You also used to read French books. Yes. What did you read? Guy de Maupassant, for example. "Mademoiselle de La Seiglière." We read it at school too. And Balzac... I read some of his work. And Jules Verne. I can just about put them on an equal footing. These were books you read as a boy? - Yes. - You read Flaubert. Flaubert too. Gustave Flaubert, yes. Yes, but now, being here 45 years later, the last time I spoke French, it is of course difficult to remember it all again. The older you get, the worse your memory becomes. And your memory becomes less... You forget individual words and then... then it is of course difficult to speak fluently. It was also very difficult for you to come back to France at all. Am I wrong about that? Memories of the war never fade. They always remain quite vivid. And then of course... quite clearly you have to show some reticence towards the people you have hurt so much. My father. In 1940, you were a soldier in France. In 1944, you were in Greece or Russia. Weapons of death and destruction that rained down in this attack on France. And finally for the French people, freedom. Freedom from the German occupiers. The Allies landed here. From here they advanced towards the German border. The war went on for almost a year after this devastating raid. The occupying forces came here in June 1940, of course, and we were under Nazi occupation until the 6th June 1944. Was it hard being under Nazi occupation? Yes, it was very hard and above all oppressive. We had to work for the occupying forces and anyone who refused, was deported to Germany. Sadly, many never returned. But you still honour this cemetery which has lots of Germans in it. Yes. When soldiers are buried after they die, you have to honour them. For the sake of future generations, this page in history must teach them about peace and ensure that they never experience war. And it has to be said that the soldiers who were here weren't all Nazis. Of course. From the contact we've had, we found out that many of them were forcibly enlisted and they were obliged, as we were, to put up with the Nazi regime. My father didn't join the National Socialist Party. That's why he was forced to become a soldier. So, as you say, it's up to future generations to make sure they don't repeat... - such things. - The errors. I think the best thing for future generations is to get to know one another very well and, as others have said, to love one another. So why didn't you join the Party? I was the son of a primary school teacher. And it was common knowledge that primary school teachers were democratically-minded. And that was the case with us as well. Other primary school teachers from neighbouring villages met up with each other socially every Saturday, at a different teacher's house each time, and teachers were not exactly the most stupid people. And therefore I had to admit that the comments they made there, against the Hitler regime and so on, gave me plenty of food for thought and for that reason I continually put off joining the Party. Although I was put under pressure from many sides, I became convinced, from the conversations of these teachers with each other, that under Hitler's regime we would end up at war again. And that's why I didn't join the Party. The consequence of this whole business was of course that these teachers... that one teacher after another was replaced. Including my father. His place was taken by a young man who was already trained in Hitler's ideology. You were one of the first to be called up. Yes. This German military equipment is still left standing on the Normandy beaches to rust away. After 40 years. Inge? Oh, Inge. You're there. Good. I'm phoning from this call box... A lifelong love for this woman, my mother. A love of France whose border you had to cross like this. As a soldier, as the occupier. And witness what your fellow countrymen created there. A pile of rubble. France, 1940. Entering a country you love like this. On these vehicles, tanks, machines, in this uniform. France, 1940. You say you never shot anyone. That's what they all say. If nobody had fired their guns there wouldn't have been this war. Can you enter a country as a soldier on these tanks, these machines, without firing your guns? You must also have been afraid that you would be shot at when you invade like this. Forgetting Flaubert, Maupassant, forgetting that you thought you loved this country, and you go marching in like this. I look for your face here. One of them must be you. No, you were in a truck during the invasion, setting up lines of communication. Trying as little as possible to be an enemy. But the others around you came here as the enemy, and so you did too. Did you find the place where you were stationed in 1940? I was here in the spring of 1940. There were lots of these little houses... You tell Philippe Collin what it was like. It's easier than telling me. In that house. Four or six in one house. So these little wooden houses were fishermen's huts? Yes, perhaps. I don't know. But on the other side of the dunes was the exercise ground. How did the day unfold? What did you do all day in Coutainville in 1940? At five o'clock in the morning, we bathed in the sea and at seven o'clock we had breakfast. Half an hour later, there were exercises down there. Yes. And the corporal would be like this... "Attention!" "Eyes left!" Eyes left. No definite article. "Eyes right!" "Eyes straight ahead!" Yes, and then... ...lots of running. And, "Lie down!" We got down like this on the ground. And, "Get up!" Et cetera, et cetera. Three hours non-stop. Look. - In a room like this... - Yes? ...there were six or eight soldiers. - But they slept in bunk beds. - One on top of the other. At the time you sent these postcards home. French towns lay in ruins after your invasion. Well, if it doesn't affect the Germans... It did affect them. As early as 1940. Fear. These photos of Saint-Lô date from around 1900 to 1920, but this is the town you knew and the town I knew too. I was ten, or nine even. And the houses no longer exist but the places, or what we could see of them, existed. On the wall of this building here, I remember seeing, in 1940, a black-and-white poster showing a German soldier carrying a little boy in his arms and handing him a jam sandwich. And written on the poster was: "Trust the German soldiers." In this street here, the parents of a school friend of mine ran a newsagent's and I saw the newspaper there in 1941 when the Germans invaded Russia. I remember it well. And you left soon afterwards. - You left Saint-LG in about 1941? - Yes. This is the police station. You might remember that. The town hall. The clothes date from around 1910 but apart from that, nothing changed between then and 1944. It still resembled the 19th century in 1944. This is the Champ de Mars, the post office. - What else is there? - Ah, the post office? - Yes. - The square in front of the post office. Yes, the Place du Champ de Mars. I received a telegram from my father-in-law, announcing the birth of my daughter, Emma. Inge? Oh, good. Yes, so how are you? Very well, yes. It's so nice here. You wouldn't believe it. Wonderful! OK, see you later! So the French flee from their ruined homes at the time I was born, 1940. My parents were not murderers. But they couldn't stop the war either, which affected them again and again. One person alone couldn't stop it. Many wanted to stop it, as you say. So could Hitler alone carry on with the war against the wishes of so many? What am I meant to believe? What can I believe? I'm your daughter. So, listeners, at this moment you represent the nation abroad. And I'd like to put ten questions to you, that you along with the German people must answer before the whole world, but especially our enemies who are also listening to us on their radios right now. Is that what you want? The British say that the German people have lost their faith in victory. I ask you: Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want it to be more total and extreme than we could ever imagine it to be today? You wore such a uniform too. When they saw you in it in occupied countries, they hated you, not you as a person - they hated the material, the uniform, the insignia, and you hid behind it, for those who Hitler's war had conquered, which wasn't your war and yet it was your war. I expect that the war will end in such a way that those who can still stand on two legs will rob those who are lying on the ground. Did you see the Germans arrive? The Germans? Yes. I watched out of my kitchen window. I watched them pass. There were endless convoys going past. They were going up to Cherbourg. That stayed with me. It's unthinkable. I remember, my father was a hunter and his hunting dog was on the other side of the road. And I saw one of the Germans leave his convoy to pick up the dog and take it with him. My father was a hunter and he really loved his dog. Naturally, he thought things had got off to a bad start. My parents were farmers. We had quite a few cattle and when we came back, we found none. Everything had disappeared. So my brother and I had to find work after the war. There was nothing here for us, so we each took up a profession. I became a mechanic and my brother a pastry cook. I worked as a mechanic for a number of years and then I became a sales rep. I spent my days driving all over Normandy. And one day, I was in a customer's attic. I was installing a television aerial and as I passed the wire over the roof, I put my hand on a German rifle, a Mauser. It brought memories of the war back to me. And after, that I collected anything I found from World War II, piece by piece, and I built these models. And I've ended up with this museum with 121 models on display. So that's how the collection came about. Bagnoles-de-l'Orne. You were stationed here one winter. I've got my rifle, for example. Every one of us had a rifle. But with my rifle I never... I never fired a single shot! Throughout the whole war. You walked through these autumn leaves in your green uniforms, longing for leave, your family, your home, and carried the war with you deep into the innocent woods. Oh, there you are. Oh, how lovely it is to hear your voice again. Yes, I've arrived here in Bagnoles. Yes, yes. Everything OK at home? Yes. Splendid! So I'll be with you again in 10 to 14 days. Goodbye, see you then. Yes. Goodbye! How long were you away from Mum at that time? 6 1/4 years. And you had leave now and again, didn't you? Yes, two weeks once a year. And the rest of the time you were afraid you would never see your wife again? Yes, I was very afraid before the Russian campaign, but I was posted just in time to Greece and then everything was OK. And then when you came back, everything had changed terribly. Yes, it certainly had. You too? Yes, one is bound to be changed by a time like that spent in the army. Tough military service changes everyone. And your wife had changed too? Yes, I guess she was a bit depressed after such a long time on her own. Until I... Until I was four, I wasn't really aware of you at all, and then I only had a father... because you were away a lot then too, I only had a father for a very short time. - Yes, yes. - Brief moments. Unfortunately, that was the case. And therefore I always really found it so difficult to imagine what sort of relationship I could have with you. Yes, a proper family. You told me that the kitchen was here. Yes, the kitchen was here. Our field kitchen was here. The big truck with the... The big truck was here. And at the back there was a stove and a field kitchen on it. And that's where the soldiers got their meals, the soldiers of my company. And they just sat all around, or what was it like? No, they sat down wherever they could find somewhere to sit. They sat down there. Otherwise, they took their meals standing up. - Just standing up? - Yes, out of their mess tins. - That's not nice either. - No. And spoons and forks were joined together with a hinge. Oh, yes, I know that. Everything was made of aluminium and quite light. It was really... - ...not a very pleasant life. - No. - When you think that... - No, but you get used to it. The casino. A place for officers. Forbidden for ordinary soldiers. At this time you were an officer cadet. You organised supplies because you spoke the best French. Wine, beer, champagne for the casino. Beer for the troops. Was there dancing here? Yes, but not very often. On Saturdays, if at all. Saturday night to Sunday morning. What sort of women were here? Were they from France? I can't say, but they came in cars and... I don't know where they came from. I can't say. You weren't here much? No, I was only here if there were any special matters to deal with, when something happened. For example, when someone drunkenly shot and smashed a chandelier, when they were celebrating a birthday. Show me this chandelier. Then I was ordered to get it repaired. Everything has changed a lot here, hasn't it? Yes, it has changed. These chairs and these tables? Yes, I think they were different as well. But here... That's not the chandelier? These aren't the same chandeliers, no. They were... It was different. Did they play roulette here as well? Yes, I believe so. But you were never in the room? No, I was never there. And over there was the hotel you stayed in? That was the hotel, yes. Do you know which floor and what kind of room? Yes, on the first floor, third room on the left. - And now it's... - ...closed. Yes, it was here. Here on the first floor. The third room. Have a look along here. Peter stayed in here. That's right. Yes. And Heinrich next door. All right. Oh, yes. Such a long time ago! Half a lifetime ago. Grand Hôtel Bagnoles. Hôtel Des Thermes. After the French army surrendered it was handed over to you, the German occupiers. - Good day, sir. - Good day. - Are you looking for something? - Yes, yes, yes. We'll be more comfortable talking inside. - Thank you. - Come in. - Sit down. - Thank you very much. My name is Hermann Sanders. I'm German, as you know. - I'm Mr Tertre. - Yes. My name is Auguste Tertre. I was born round here so I know it well, and the time when it happened. During the war I met a Mr Zolar. He was a gardener here in Bagnoles-de-l'Orne. - He was at the Grand Hôtel. - Yes. I was in his garden, in his big garden. The big garden on the other side of the casino. I like flowers. - And we got on very well together. - You became friends? Did you watch him growing his plants in the greenhouses? They left soon afterwards. - He left? - They left. I don't know whether he died here. I can't remember. But he was replaced in 1942. - As early as 1942? - 1942. - He was replaced at the Grand Hôtel. - Right. Why did Zolar have to go? Because he had been your friend? "What sort of times are these "in which a conversation about trees is almost a crime, "because it implies silence about so many atrocities?", said Brecht. I've never seen a tree quite like that before. Come and see. Look at all the branches. - The trunk and the branches. - There's hardly any trunk. The branches start one metre from the ground. All the branches start from here. You can see here. It's exactly the same. - Ah, yes. - All of them. - These are individual branches. - How wonderful. It's not a central trunk. I've made enquiries and there are two like this in France. You who loved the French, spoke their language, what did you think when they went past you like that? You didn't want to come back here. You were afraid of the streets because they were so full of these memories. France, 1940. Germany, 1945. As if history could have a conscience. As if there could be revenge. And it is still easier to talk about roses than about people. - Good day, madam. - Good day, sir. - Come in. - May I? - Yes. - I see you have red roses. In my garden in Germany I have roses too. - You are German? - Yes, I am German. I was here in Bagnoles in 1940 and 1941. - Very good. - For six months. But.. I think I recognise you. - That's possible. - Yes. - Did you have a laboratory? - Yes. And a photography shop. Photography, perfumes. So you are Mrs... - Mrs Chef. - I am Mrs Chef, yes. - We always called you that. - Always Mrs Chef. - So you left Bagnoles for Russia. - Yes, Russia. - In 1941. - Yes, yes. - I went to Russia. - You did. When you left for Russia some soldiers came to my shop to get their photographs because they were leaving for Russia and they took lots of blankets because they were worried about the cold. What did you do at the Grand Hôtel? What was your role? Your daughter said you had a car. I had a car, a Buick, and I used a truck to buy beer and food. - Provisions. - Yes. I'm trying to imagine you as a German soldier with your uniform. - Did you wear a cap? - Did you bring any photos? Did you bring a photo of that? - A lot of your fellow soldiers died. - In Russia. - A lot of soldiers. - A lot of soldiers, yes. In your regiment, the 39th? You were in the 39th regiment? - I don't know. - I think you were. There were 500 soldiers with me. - That's right. - One regiment. - There were between 400 and 500. - 500 soldiers. - And when you came back from Russia? - Three companies. And how many of you came back from Russia? Only me. - Only you? - And one other comrade. - Only two? - From Thessaloniki to Berlin. - I see. - You were lucky to get away. You were young. How old were you then? I was 30. My husband was called up in June 1940. In June 1940? He was called up in June. He had already fought in World War I. World War I? He left for the front in 1914, at the age of 17. He died on the 11th June 1940. I had a car then. I went to the hospital to see about burying my husband. And...there were military convoys, refugees on all sides. I'd never seen anything quite like it. I don't know how I got through, the roads were so busy. There were military trucks. There were refugees. There were the poor children who were lost. - I saw a little girl. - They were all evacuated. This little girl was looking for her mummy and daddy. I said to her, "What are you doing? Where is your mummy and daddy?" "I don't know. I want them. I want them!" That was the war for you. Of course I was on my own. With my daughter. My daughter was only 11 then. This is what France looked like in 1940. Worse still, Russia in 1942. Every country you invaded looked like that. A father, a child from a people that these countries have since recognised as murderers. That's what we are. You say nothing. You don't want to speak. You want to forget. To grow old, be kind. To forgive. We are helpless. - Ah, hello. - Hello. How are you? Did you sleep well? Yes, I slept well, very well. - Yes, ten hours. - Ten hours! That's a lot. Yes! The schoolchildren of Bagnoles are going to recite a poem for you: "I Salute You, My France" by Louis Aragon. "I salute you, my France." "I Salute You, My France, with your soft grey eyes "However great my torment, my love is undiminished "My France, my cause, both old and new "Soil sewn with heroes, sky full of sparrows "I salute you, my France, where the winds have calmed "My France of forever, whose geography "Opens up like a palm in the sea breeze "So the sea birds can alight safely "Home to both dove and eagle "inhabited by valour and song alike "I salute you, my France, where the wheat and the rye "Ripen in the sunshine of diversity "I salute you, my France, where the people are skilled "At jobs which brighten up our days "People will come from afar to salute you in your city "My beloved Paris, besieged in vain for three years "Now happy and strong again and wearing, as a scarf "This rainbow as a sign there will be no more thunder "This freedom with which the silent harps quiver "My France from beyond the deluge, I salute you" Louis Aragon. We will now list the dead. 1914 to 1918. - Gigot. - Died for France. - Legeay. - Died for France. - Nugues. - Died for France. - Vittecocq. - Died for France. - Brancherie. - Died for France. - Allard. - Died for France. - Jardin. - Died for France. - Vaugon. - Died for France. - Chauvière. - Died for France. 1939 to 1945. - Tournelier. - Died for France. 1948 to 1949. - Brillant. - Died for France. In their memory, we will now observe a minute's silence. Ladies and gentlemen, friends. There are no words moving enough to express how happy I am to be among you today. I would like to thank the mayor and all those who have contributed to the success of this day. My compliments, too, to all the ladies who have embellished, with their charm and their smiles, this most enjoyable day. I raise my glass to friendship, to the brotherhood of all and to peace. Cheers. One of them was in the resistance and a prisoner of war in Germany, the other was part of the German occupation in France. That's me in civvies. Whenever I got a fortnight's leave, my uniform... This gentleman says he was working at the Grand Hôtel when you were there. Oh, yes. - Perhaps you recognise him. - We transported... - Food? - Food. Yes, that was me. Yes! Full of life. And I bought the kitchens at the Grand Hôtel. - Yes, yes. - I live there now. - You live there? - Yes. - My father is delighted to see you. - This is the lady I told you about. - She still has her bar. - We meet at last. I'm very happy to see you again. Me too. - So you remember him fondly? - Yes. - He wasn't a bad man? - They were no bad men here. I've told her all about you. I'm still at the café. I'm still running my café. We'll come and visit you. - Tomorrow. - I'll bring him in. - Will you be open tomorrow? - Yes, yes. Just knock. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Hello. - Good evening. - Are you well? - Yes. - How are you? - Very well. - And you? - Me too. - Will you have a drink with us? - Yes. You departed from Bagnoles on these tracks. On your way to Russia. You told me very little. I want to believe you. It is better for me. All the same, I want to be able to love you.
