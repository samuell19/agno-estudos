Cramer to Control: Cramer to Control, come in Control. Search Control to 3-10. We read you Cramer come in. About a mile east of Harold's Cut-Off. No sign of them yet. Any word from Donaldson? Donaldson reports negative, but is setting up blockade at the intersection of US 89 and Route 12. Do we have orders for his unit? Have his unit continue blockade. I'll meet him at approximately 21 hundred. I want to check the date and lay-out in the mean time. I'll report back to you then. 3-10. There's no question that your designs and theories are far advance of anything that our research department has come up with. Your use of solar energy as an inexhaustible power supply is an excellent theory. But, it has to be proved! As do all your innovations. Everything I design and build works! Outside stands a missile, capable of safely transporting a man into space. And I've proved it! I've proved it time and time again. That's quite true Colonel. In a series of static tests we've simulated several trips to space. The graphs from these telemetering devices will confirm that. In a project of this magnitude static tests prove nothing. Gentlemen, you must understand that missile experimentation is government business. Strictly government! I don't see why. Just in the case of medical research it can be a private project as well. We've been through all this before many times. I'm only carrying out orders. Tomorrow morning a team of government experts will take over. We'll see that all your information is turned over to them. Hi Sheriff. Sorry to bother you Mr. Dayton. Quite alright, come on in. Well this isn't exactly a social call. Couple of prisoners escaped from the county farm. I'd like to search your property. Why, you don't have to waste time asking permission. You can go right ahead. Well, I've already given the grounds once over. I was wondering about the area within the electric fence. Around the rocket ship? Not much chance of them getting past the fence without our knowledge. I don't know Mr. Dayton. These are a couple of really smart boys. Didn't expect them to get past the prison fence either. I see your point. Dirk can you cut the electric power in there so the sheriff can look around? Of course. I'm sorry I broke up your meeting Mr. Dayton. No bother at all. I hope you catch your men. So do I. Huh. Everything seems to happen at once. Sorry you object so strenuously but you understand my position. I've really been expressing Dirk's feelings. He's been working so hard on and long in complete secrecy that he resents any outside intrusion. You'll have to admit that's quite an accomplishment. Absolutely fantastic. How did you happen to meet Dirk Green? He wrote me a letter. Said he knew of my research work in Missile Design. Claimed this location was perfect for a project he wanted to develop and asked if I'd work with him. When I learned what he had in mind I jumped at the chance. Now that he's completed it what does he intend to do with it? Fly it to the moon. Oh, I'd bet your not serious. Oh, it's an obsession with Dirk. If you hadn't intervened I know he would have attempted the trip. But funny thing is, I'm sure he would have made it. Is this a private party or is anyone invited? Hello Darling. Oh, if I'm interupting... Not at all. Colonel Wickers, this is my fiance June Saxton. How do you do? How do you do. I'm afraid I'm more of a grass widow than a fiance. It's next to impossible to get Steve to break away from his work. I'm surprised he found any time for work. Colonel Wickers represents the Government Space Experimentation Program. Beginning tomorrow Dirk and I will be working under him. That sounds wonderful. Now that he has someone to help him I may stand a better chance of corralling a husband. Well I'm glad someones on my side. By the way the sheriff's car is outside. Oh, Dirk's out at the launching pad with him. They're looking for a couple of escaped prisoners. Don't touch the fence till I turn off the current. Alright? Turns off... Would you open the gate? This was a great idea. Like hiding out in a gas chamber. This place gives me the creeps. Always beefing... Had to listen to you. Wise guy! Great place to hide he says! Read about it in the papers. This is a private project. No army guarding the place. We can hide here till the heats off. Are you kidding me? You can. Not me. I'm taking my chances out in the open. This place is worse than a cell. Come on you leading the way? Before you go you better take a look out there. Get back! Guy's looking right up here. He hasn't taken his eyes of the ship once. Getting the feeling he can see us. Well you sure got us into some fix. If that guy can see us, what's he having the sheriff look out of over there for? That's bugging me too. Who is that other guy? Beats me. Maybe it's Dirk Green. Who? The paper said he built this thing. The paper, what do they know? They said I stole 3 cars. So? So it was 5 cars. What do they know? Hey, they're coming this way. Hey, up the ladder. Well, there is no sign of them. We better take a look in the ship. Oh no, no, they wouldn't be up there. They could be anywhere. One of the prisoners is a pretty shrewd kid. The other one's smart. Too smart. He's the brains, Gary Fennell. I think we better take a look around. Just as you say Sheriff but why not let me do it? After all there's a lot of delicate equipment up in that ship and I'd... I'd rather not have strangers roaming about in it. Fair enough, I'll wait down here. Right. So hot in here. No air. Probably suffocate to death. Well you want to try the ladder? Oh no. Not me. I'm telling you if I had a gun I'd... Yeah, I'd see you be a big man with a gun. Everything okay?! Everything's alright... There's no one here! What's the bet? I don't get it. Should we trust him? Do we got a choice? Certainly we got a choice. Not gunna trust nobody. Come on let's get out of here. It's locked. He locked it. That dirty... I don't get it. I don't get it! Oh, you're finally back. Any sign of the prisoners? Hello June. No, no. The sheriff didn't see anybody yet. Has Wickers left? Yes he has. Join us with a drink? I won't let you refuse. We're celebrating. Now that Colonel Wickers and his staff are coming to help you Steve has promised to take time off for a wedding. Nobody's going to take over my work. I designed and build to fly that ship into space. And I'm going to see that it does. Now Dirk let's be reasonable. Think of all the information we can contribute toward the future development of space travel, Yes... Yes you're right. I can teach them a lot about space. I'll give them something they'll never forget. I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing. Oh, you can't blame him. He spent a lot of time on that ship. He's bitterly disappointed but he'll have a new outlook by morning, Everything will turn out alright. Here's to our happiness. Nothing up there but a jig and wires. Looks like we're stuck here. And you're the jerk that arranged this freak hide away. Look who's talking. I never should have let you talk me into making that break with you. I had 6 months. 6 lousy months and I'd have been through. Are you crazy? Yeah. I was crazy to try that stick up that got me in trouble in the first place. One hair brained thing I ever did in my life. Hey look Lon, don't you chicken out on me now. I got a lot of connections. I want to show you the ropes, okay? Oh, relax! It's food. Aren't you hungry? Yes, we're... You know who we are? What do you think? Here. Eat. Here! Hey come here. Look at this. Whole chicken. Fruit. Cake. Hey, what's the big idea, huh?! Food okay? Yeah. I have a proposition to make. I knew there would be a catch. Well go on. What is it? I want to take this ship up tonight. Up? Up where? To the moon. Now look George if you want to speak to me you better shake the loose parts out of your head. Yeah man look, we're trying to get away, but not that far. Now get this straight. I'm taking this ship to the moon tonight. I can make it alone. But it would be a lot easier with your help. Now the trip itself will be reasonably comfortable, providing the unexpected doesn't occur. There is plenty of specially prepared rations aboard and well, well boys? This guys nuttier than a fruit cake. Hey, what do you say we jump him? I think he really means it. Every word of it. Once more: We can make it! Now look, knock it off. Don't give me that stuff. I'm getting of here right now. You'll here me out! Now I said I had a proposition to make! Now, you guys join up with me peacefully and give me your absolute cooperation Then there will be no trouble. If you refuse, I'll just have to use this. Some choice Mister. You drive a hard bargain. The operating procedure is quite simple. Our destination is pre-set. The guidance system will keep us on course the entire trip. And I can easily show you boys what to do if you'll listen carefully. He sounds so sure of himself. What are you thinking? This is a crazy idea. Take a trip to the moon! Hey, wait a minute, are we coming back? If we reach the moon, coming back is a simple matter. If we go to the moon, and we come back, that means we're heroes doesn't it! What do you think? Yeah I am way ahead of you. Okay Mister. We've got a deal. Alright then let's get going. First thing I want you fellas to do is change into clothes you'll find in that locker over there. I think I'll be running along. Let me lock up the panel. I'll drive you home. That's peculiar. What is it? I don't know. Something's wrong. The signal from the missile are flashing. Somebody's mucking around out there. I'd better go take a look. I'll go with you! Don't leave me here alone with those two convicts still running loose. Sure, come along. Seatbelts fastened? Yeah. Check. Hey do we need oxygen masks? No, this control room is sealed. Contains it's own oxygen source. Sure, like in pressurized planes. No. We're sealed. We're not under pressure. The same air is continously washed and cooled. All set? I guess so. My stomach feels a little jittery though. Alright turn around and lock your chairs the way I showed you. And Gary, that little switch there in the middle of the panel marked gyro, flip it up. What's that for? Don't ask questions. Just do what you are told. Lon. Yeah? Flip up all the controls marked astro. Three of them. At the right there. Astro switches on. Alright. Somebody's in the ship. Here we go. Who's up there? I don't know what's going on. But I think somebody's trying to take off in this rocket. We've got to get out! They've sealed the ship. Isn't there anyway you can open it? No. Quickly. There's no oxygen in this compratment. Hurry, here are couple of spare face masks. Alright, now listen carefully. I'm going to being the countdown. Gary, at 7, when I say 7, flip on all those switches in the lower row. Got it? I think so. I want you to be sure! Yeah, yeah. At the count of 7 put all the switches on in the bottom row. Right. Lon you follow me! In front of you are ten levers. Each are numbered. Yeah, 1 to 10 okay. As I count them down you pull a lever. And confirm the number by repeating it loud, got it? Pull each one as you make the countdown, check. K, here we go. 10! 10! 9! 9! 8! 8! 7! 7! 6! 6! When I give you the word, put on your mask and brace yourself. Will we be killed? We've got our chances. Quickly. There go the igniters. 1! 1! 0! You fellas alright? Oh! My aching back! Feels like it's been nailed down forever. I'm almost afraid to try to move. A lot rougher than I expected. But apparently everything's alright though. Counter-balance indicator! Are we okay? Something's out of place in the lower chamber. The control system is stabilizing to correct it. Well release yourself and check the lower compartment. Hey, there's somebody down here! They're dead! Dirk... What happened? What's that sound? Where are we? Good lord we're moving! Oh, take it easy. Everythings alright. You've been out a long time. You crazy fool what have you done! We're thousands of miles into space! Everything is working as we designed it. We're on course and everything is under control. June! Where's June? June's alright. June's right here. Are you alright Darling? I'm fine. Who are they? The two escaped convicts. I needed a crew! I still can't believe it. Lie back and rest Darling. Everything Dirk has said is true. It's going to be alright. Oh, this has turned into quite a party. Uh-huh. I think I'm going to like this. Except I don't approve of the company she keeps. 224 over 10. Minus 25. Minus 25. Well that does it. We can calibrate the left bank tomorrow. How does it look? Matches the static telemetering charts perfectly. Good. Well I think I'll lie down for a little while. Why don't you do the same steve? I will in a while, but I think I'll callibrate the dual calculators Gary you want to give me a hand? I'm just along for the ride. Gary? I'll help. While you're up there check to see our indicators will you? We may be passing a field of meteorites. soon and we'll need the warning panels. We'll do it. Meteorite fields? Yes, there our most serious hazard. If we should intercept a floating field there's always a chance they may penetrate our hull. However this indicator will warn us if we approach such a field. If you'd like, why don't you watch the screen till Steve finishes? Thanks. I'd like to. Gary, will you please go down to the lower compartment Look, dad. I've been watching that panel for hours. Can't you see I'm resting. I'm no messenger boy. If you want something you get it. Everything seems to be working properly. Just relax now. No, no, no. We haven't got all day. Please, don't. Oh, I've watched you with that Steve guy. You don't fool me. Come on. Let's you and I have a little fun, huh? That's quite enough. If Steve could see... Why don't call him? He's right up there. But you won't because you like it. Gary! Stop it! You keep away from her. Oh, we're just having a friendly little conversation. What's wrong with that? You've been asking for it. What's the beef? You got a little interest here too? You rotten little punk! No, Dirk please, no trouble! This is no trouble this is a pleasure! Stop it you too, please! What's that?! Meteorites! What's wrong?! We're in the middle of a meteorite field! How long will this keep up? It's hard to say! Isn't there something you can do? Hey that battery broke loose. I'll get it! Stay where you are! Can't we help him?! The warning light has stopped! I think we're clear. Let's go. Hurry, grab him. Grab it! Dirk! There isn't much time. Listen to me closely. The controls are preset so the ship will land in a specified area. And area designated by me. Now don't change it. You must land there. Lie still. Don't talk. We'll take care of you. Take this. And don't lose it. You'll need it where you're going. What for? Why Dirk? Why will I need this? It's all up to you Steve. It's all up to you now. Lido. My Lido. Forgive me. Forgive... Dirk! He's dead. That jewelry's still bugging you, huh? That and some other things. Dirk for instance had allowed for every obstacle we'd run into in space. He was right. Every time. That babe that he was talking about. What was her name? Lida... Lieda? Lido. That's another thing. And finally why was he insistent about landing at a particular place on the moon. The moons the moon. One place is as good as the other to me. Like he expected something to be there. That, that sparkler in that medallion. What do you think that's worth, huh? A couple of grand? 3? 4? Don't get any ideas. There's nothing you can do with diamonds on the moon. What we need now is some good old fashioned luck. Hey, June. Steve! Come here quickly! Something's happening. Turn on the forward scanner. I think this it. It's a dream come true. I'm so happy I don't know what to say. If everything goes well we'll be seeing a lot of the moon. Right now there is work to be done. Break out the space suits Lon. Gary you know where the helmets are stored. The automatic reverse thrust mechanism should take over now. We won't be able feel the sensation of slowing down. We'll just have to cross our fingers and wait. That's it! Make it snappy fellas we're coming in! Brake 1! Brake 2! Brake 3! Power off! You look like you just saw a ghost! If I look like you I do. This is the end of the line! Everybody out! My head feels like it's in jail. How do you breathe in here anyway? It'll feel stuffy for a while but you'll get usto it. Check your oxygen regulator till it feels comfortable. These gravitational shoes work like a charm. Hope these outfits are in style. Getting acclamated? Feels better than when I first put it on. If we're all set, let's take a look around. Hey, what's the hardware for? The what? The hardware. The gats. The guns. You expect to run across a rabbit? Just precautionary. I'll lead you follow. Keep together in single file. How long do we keep this up? If we don't get back soon the sun will be out. I hope not. The heat from it will roast us alive. Hey, hey. Listen. There's someone following us. No chance of that. Your hearing is more sensitive through your receiveing set. Just some loose rocks sliding. Look out! Hey, over there! Look! Another one up there! They're trying to surround us! Out this way! Lon! Hey, hey look! Oh, Steve! We've got to stop him! Guns won't stop him. We're trapped. There's a cave. Let's head for it! For some reason, they don't want to come in here. Yeah well that's okay by me. Can we rest a little while please? Let's move out back a way. I want to put a lot of space between those creatures and us. That cramped cabin in the ship would look awfully good to me now. Boy, they'll never believe us back home. Hey, watch it! I almost broke my neck on this stick. There might be more around here. Let's see that. What is it? I can't believe it... What is it? It's an old torch. Yeah, a burnt out torch. Does that mean someone is living here? Those things in the outside. This probably where they live. Great. Some higher form of life. Steve, there's a light behind that rock. Of course. Why didn't I think of this before? Fire can't burn without oxygen. Believe it or not there's oxygen in this cave. Go ahead and take your masks off. It's okay. Nothing like good ol' stale musty air. Anything will smell better after breathing out of a bottle all day. First thing to do is get out of these suits. You found something? No, nothing. It's nothing Your a liar, Dayton. Hey, take it easy Gary, come on. What do you mean? He's holding out on us! He's found something he doesn't want us to know about! He's right. There's nothing to be alarmed about. There's some tracks that were made recently. You see, what'd I tell ya? It only confirms what we already know. Some higher form of life exists in this cave. Well, I'm not staying around this place. Soon we'll all be killed. I'm going back to the ship. Now who's going with me? There's no sense in panicking. We've got weapons and plenty of ammunition. A lot of good it did against those things out there. Oh no... I'm leaving. There's something else in this tunnel. I can feel it! Feel there eyes watching us. I'm leaving! Hey Gary! Come back here! You're going the wrong way! I better get him Steve. No. We've got to stick together. It's the only chance we've got. Gary's footsteps. They've stopped. Gary, come back! What are you doing? Who are you?! Oh no! No! Keep away from me! They've got him Steve! They've got him! What's that I smell? Some kind of gas. I can't breathe Steve. It's okay June. How do you feel? Oh, no. This can't be where I think it is. No such luck. We're still alive. All I can remember is somebody walked up in front of me smoking a cigar and boom! Knocked me for a loop. I wonder where we are. Uh-oh. Hey, Dayton, we've got company. I bid you welcome to Orlanda. I am Lido. High ruler of our humble domain. I am told you are intruders from an unknown origin. I look forward to hearing of your journey. There will be time for that. Now you must rest and partake of our hospitality. Don't worry. It's not poisoned. If they wanted us to die, they could have finished us off back in the tunnel. Why it's delicious! I am pleased to see that you find our offerings satisfying. It may interest you to know the food in front of you was produced long before I was born. Good. Something to drink. What's the deal? I don't know. Maybe she doesn't like my face? That's not it. These girls maybe a little strange but I don't think they're crazy. The medallion. Get it for me. No! I will do it. Yes. It is Dirk. He has returned. Dirk? My Dirk. Your time will come Lambda. For now you will see the others are made comfortable. Dirk. You will follow me. Steve. It will be alright Honey. I'll be back in a minute. I'm not worried about myself. I'm worried about you. Will you come with me please? We had long ago given you up for lost. It is good that you have returned to us. You must tell about the Earth. It's climate. Atmospheric conditions. Everything you've learned. That's a pretty big order. I'll need a little time. You ask for the one thing I can not give you. You see, Dirk, much has happened since you left us. The ship that took you to Earth never... Nor did the scientists who were aboard it. As a result those few of us left are in grave peril. Our oxygen is fast disappearing. Our food supply is dwindling. Soon this satellite will be barren. Devoid of life. Are there others like you... Like us, who live here? You've seem to forgotten much during your stay on Earth, Dirk. You have not even commented on my blindness. I was very sorry to see it. You need not be. The affliction of my eyes has been accompanied by a heightening of my other senses. You remember of course by what right I acquired my power to rule here. Of course. Come closer to me Dirk. I wish to see how much you've changed while you were away from us. You are different. Perhaps the change is for the better. Alpha was pleased. Alpha? I suppose it is only natural that you did not recognize her. She was a very little girl when you left us. However, your betrothal still stands. known the me the scientific details of your trip. Shall we begin? Yes. And I used to think those scientists who wanted to reach the moon were kooky. Man this is it. This is fantastic. I can't believe it. It seems like a dream. Well Honey, if there wasn't better material around I'd volunteer to pinch you. Hello there Sweety. How are you? Say, uh, what do you say you and I get some earth light, huh? You speak so strangely. Oh, I do huh? Well I may speak strangely, But I make myself understood. Let's get away from the crowd. Come on. He's as subtle as a sledgehammer. Gary's alright I guess. A little hard headed. But he doesn't mean any harm. Deliver me from the people who don't mean any harm. They're the one's who cause it all. Just like being on top of the Empire State Building. I do not understand. That's alright. Come here. Come here! I'm not going to bite ya. That's better. Now. What is this set-up, huh? Again you puzzle me! What gives, what gives! Where are all the men around here? Don't you even have a boyfriend? You are the first man I've ever seen. I'm told we usto have many. Well honey we got to catch up for lost time. Hey! Are these real? Again you puzzle me. These diamonds. These rocks. Are they real? These. They're worn only for adornment Do you like them? I sure do. They are real. Who gave you these? No one. I found them myself. You found them? Yes they are of no special value. Honey, show me where you found these. There are thousands like these in the lower end of the caves. Well take me there, fast! But what of the others? Don't worry about the others. We'll surprise them. I'll them about it later. If that is your wish. No, thank you. I wonder what's keeping Steve. Oh, I can't imagine. They probably have a lot to talk about. Oh, he better be talking. Oh, that reminds me. I better find Gary. He's got a bad habit of getting lost. Especially with pretty girls. Hey, hurry back. They're giving me a complex. If there was going to be this kind of competition I would have undressed for the occasion. From what you tell me Dirk, the planet earth would not satisfy our needs. Fortunately, I have another destination in mind. Tell the earth people they are not to consider themselves prisoners. They may move about as they wish. Provided they do not try to escape. You will rejoin them now. Yes. Thank you Lido. I'll tell them. What did she say? What's going to happen? Shh. Over here. The Lido is blind. She thinks I'm Dirk Green. Dirk? So that's the reason he wanted to be sure we'd land here. What about the others? Surely they know your not. They were all very young when Dirk was sent to earth. That ship never returned. What's going to happen if they find out you're not Dirk? Well the oxygen here is disappearing here rapidly. They exterminate everyone who doesn't perform a useful function. That leaves us. Steve, what can we do? We're not in immediate danger. They want our rocket ship. It's their only hope of salvation. She told an amazing story of how their civilization has dwindled to their present state of survivors. It seems their troubles began about 20 years ago. Hello. I saw you in the hall. Perhaps I can help you? Oh, no. I was just looking for my friend. It isn't important. He'll be back. Don't leave. I'd like to talk to you. Yes? I was... I was just noticing that it seems lighter out there now. It was dark when we landed. Well the sun is approaching. Oh, do you have days and nights like we do on Earth? I mean how often does the sun shine? Too often. It comes around every 17 nemlos. We fear the sunlight because our surface has no atmosphere and the heat is intense. Only the Rock Creatures can survive it. We had a run with them when we landed. It's a good thing they didn't follow us into the caves. We would have been gonners. There's oxygen in caves. The Rock Creatures thrive on the sun but slightest exposure to oxygen is fatal to them. Do you not have Rock Creatures on Earth? Oh, no. No, we don't. You know, if I was out with a pretty girl on Earth probably wouldn't even be talking about them either. You would not be talking? No, I wouldn't. That was nice. Consequently this is the last pocket of atmosphere When this goes, that's the end. Is there any way we can help? Not a chance. By the way, there's one more thing. That girl. Alpha. She's suppose to be my bride. Your bride?! Dirk's bride. It was arranged a long time ago before Dirk left for earth. Now, look here Romeo, if you think for one instant that you and that... Actually, it will be alright. I'll simply explain the circumstances. Dirk. You'd better start explaining. Come Dirk. It is time. Time? For our marriage ceremony. The Lido is ready. We shouldn't rush into this too fast. We ought to discuss it. Talk about it. I've waited a long time Dirk. Just a minute! What's the meaning of this?! Well, I'll tell you the meaning of this. That happens to be my fella you've got your arms around. And his name is not Dirk Green. It's Steve Dayton. So you just better be careful before I forget I'm a lady. Ow! She will die! I guess that did it. Steve I'm sorry but I just saw red. It's alright Honey. They'll all no about the masquerade in a minute anyways. We'll have to get a move on. I don't get it. What's it all about? We're going to have round Gary up and get out of here. Leave? I was just beginning to like it. Where is Gary? Oh, Zema saw him headed for the caves. I think they're this way. Come on. They're imposters! The name of the man who calls himself Dirk is really Dayton. He must have stolen the medallion. Fool. You think your Lido did not know this? That she could be so easily decieved? I wish to keep my knowledge secret from the earth people until I had learned more about them. Their hopes. Their fears. Their reasons for coming here. But now because of your blundering... They must all die! All except Dayton. I will accept him as my husband. What you ask is impossible. We need the others to help in piloting the strange craft in which they arrived. I say they die! The one called Dayton can give us all the information we need for running the ship! You overstep your bounds Alpha. I am the Lido. You will obey my orders. You grow old. Old and weak. You have outlived your usefullness. Orlanda must have a new leader. Even the medallion which is a symbol for your leadership is too heavy for you to hold. Your hand grows weary. My will is stronger than yours Lido. I, Alpha, demand you to drop the medallion. You have exercised your right to challenge for the throne. And you have lost. But someday you will win. Now however, my orders must be obeyed. Yes, my Lido. Real diamonds. Put right before me. Your ways are strange. My ways are rich, Baby. You gotta help find the way back. I gotta get something to put all this stuff in. Oh one more thing. Don't tell the others about this you understand? I understand but I do no not think this secrecy... Don't think Honey. Just be beautiful. Come on. Where is the Lido? The prisoners are in the passages. They've seemed to escaped. There is no time to tell the Lido. We must act now to prevent them from reaching their ship. Shall we prepare the gas? No. They have violated our Lido's trust. This time they must be taught a stronger lesson. The dark creatures. But it is decreed the Lido... Silence! There is no time to waste. Hey Steve. I don't like it. I've seen enough of these people to respect their intelligence. They're not going to sit by and just let us just walk out of here. You might be right, but we've got no choice. We've got to take that chance. This looks like the turnoff. Yeah that's the rock. Now all we have to do is find Gary and... Hey! They're gone. The space suits are gone. I knew it was too easy. Steve, there's something about this place. Yeah I know what you mean. Let's get out of here! There's something moving in there. That's Dayton and the others. N-no. You mustn't go in there. They're trying to get away without me. They're going to leave me here! Alright! What's the big idea, huh? Trying to cut out on me, huh? Easy. We were just going to look for ya. Oh sure. I bet. Please listen to me. You must leave this section of the tunnel at once. Hurry! It's too late... They know! Hey, Lambda! You have defied the Lido. You will die. You were fortunate to have alluded the darkness. I hope you have learned that escape is hopeless. I'd admit it was a foolish move. Now if you'd please, I'd like to have an audience with the Lido. You continually avoid me... Do you not find me attractive? I have admiration for you and the others. But you must understand... The Earth Woman! You will soon forget her. It's no use Alpha. You can't bend me to your will. Perhaps you've forgotten that without our spaceship, you and others not leave this dying city. You are less wise than I thought. I find you, amusing. We shall get off. But we will not go to Earth. We will go to another planet. Where I will be the Lido! And you will be my husband. I could never consent to a thing like that. But you will consent! You see Dayton, my will is stronger than yours. You have no choice but to do my bidding. No. Do not avoid me. My thoughts will become your thoughts. You'll feel only hatred and distrust toward your friends. Your allegiance will be to me. And me alone. No. You're making me dizzy. My will is stronger than yours. You must obey me. You will obey me! I will obey. The Earth People. The girl. They're your enemies. They must die. Do you understand? I understand. Alpha! I wish to speak to you alone. Yes, my Lido. Again, you defy me Alpha. You know the law here. The will of the Lido must be obeyed. I, uh, I beg your indulgence my Lido. I was, uh, merely trying to obtain certain information from the man you call Dayton. Information which would help us in our plans. You add lying to your other crimes? You desire Dayton for yourself. That is not to be. I the Lido decree it. What do you decree now, my Lido?! The Lido has met with an unfortunate accident. But before her death, she appointed me as the new Lido. The Lido is dead but it is no accident. Do you defy my will?! You wish to challenge my right to be the new Lido? What is your wish my Lido? Remove the body. And then announce my ascension to the throne to the others. Yes my Lido. And, oh yes, tell the others to prepare for a wedding. A wedding that will follow an event in the extermination chamber. There isn't much time. Listen carefully. You and your friends are in grave danger. Even now the extermination chamber is being made ready for you. That's sweet of you to worry about us, but Dayton is in there now talking to the Lido. The Lido is dead. Alpha is the new Lido. If you wish the live you must... Go on, go on. It's too late. They're coming for you trust me. Prisoners are ready. You are just in time for the ceremonies. Unfortunately the Earth Girl will miss them completely. She has been sentenced to die. But first, your Earth Man has something to say. To whom do you give your heart and your mind? You my Lido. Steve! Steve don't let her do this! Can't you hear me?! Stop! I can't move... What are you doing? You can not move because I do not wish you to move. My will is supreme. It must be obeyed! Now. You give the order. No! Steve no! I love you! Tell me you love me! Take the woman to the extermination chamber. Let the ceremonies begin. Let go! No! Don't! Oh! Please stop! Listen, at the end of this corridor is a door. This key will open it. Inside you will find the strange clothes you wore when you arrived here. Come on. You're coming with us. No. I'll stay and help your friend. How? Shh. You must hurry before the dance is over. Take these. You will need them for protection against the Rock People. You will find the girl at the bottom of the stairs. Now go quickly. I'll join you later, I promise. Now please go before it is too late. I'll be waiting for you. Bye Lon. I'll always be with you. This must be it. Come on. Everything's okay now June. Where's Steve? Zema promised she'll help him. We'll wait for them here. Look I gotta go. I'll meet you back the entrance of the caves. To pick up a ticket to a swimming pool. Five block long cars and a house with 50 rooms! Stop the dancing! Where are the 2 Earth Men? Whoever is responsible will die for this. All of you! Search the area! Why are you not searching for the Earth Men? You dare defy me? You wish to die with the others? I command you to leave. At this moment the Earth Men are releasing the girl. Now you will release him. You, you can not defy me Zema. You are too weak. Even if you succeeded momentarily it would drain you of all your strength. Look, even now you grow weak. And... And uncertain... No. It is you who are powerless. You can not move or speak. Dayton you are free. Curse you! Where am I? What am I doing in these clothes? You are free over her spell. The others are wiating in the tunnel. Run! You can not leave, Zema. Your strength is gone... Forever! Steve! Thank heavens you're alright! We got to keep moving. We got to find our suits. Oh yeah. We got 'em back in the tunnel. Good. Where's Gary? He said he'd meet us later. Now, my slave, you will release the gas in the caves. And it I will be your hand that destroys the Earth People! I command you! Release the gas! Now. Pull the lever. I said pull the lever! Don't Zema. All of our atmosphere will be released! You'll kill us all! It's no use. This is the only way. What was that? Lon. I can join you forever. Zema. Something's happened to her. I know it. I gotta go back! No. Wait a minute Lon. Put your mask on quickly. The oxygen is escaping. What about Gary? He'll have to find his own way. Help! Someone hear me! Your Lido commands you! Dirk, wherever you are... You shall not live! These heat is unbearable. Our only chance is to make our way in the shadowed area near the cliffs. The heat of the sun will roast us alive. Dayton. I command you to return! Return at once! Steve! What's the matter? I've got to go back. He's under the spell of that woman. We've got to get him away. Lon, help me! Look out! The Rock Men! Dayton. You must obey me! You will obey! My Lido! You'll be killed! We've got to stop him some how! I command you Dayton! To... To... Oh... Everything's alright now. That's what you think! They're after us! Come on we gotta get out of here! Hey! Wait for me! It's Gary. They're after him. Look out! The Rock Men! They're in front of you! Put down those bags! Make a run for it but keep in the shade! Not on your life! These diamonds are mine! Nobodies gunna get 'em! Gary! Drop those bags! You'll never make it! Gary! Stay out of the sun! Ahh! Let's get to the ship. Generators seem to be working. Get ready to start the countdown. Do you think we'll make it? Well let's say we've got a good chance. Steve, before we start, there's just one thing. Yes, June? Do you... Do you think I'm prettier than that girl? The one called Alpha. Honey there's only one thing I'll ever expect to see that's prettier than you. And that's Old Mother Earth looming up in the view-plate.
