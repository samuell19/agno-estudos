"Shaolin is the origin of Kung Fu." There are Shaolin temples in Hebei, Fujian... Zhejiang, Guangdong and Sichuan. But where is the mystical and original... Shaolin Temple that gave birth to Kung Fu? Songshan is at the center of China. It is known as the "Central Mountain" and is one of five notable Chinese mountains. Songyue Tower is the symbol of Songshan. It is one of the oldest brick towers in China. Songshan is in the mid-west of Henan Province. It is divided into two parts: Taishi Mountain on the East and Shaoshi Mountain on the West. Songshan has an interesting shape. From afar, it looks like a sleeping beauty. The real origin of Shaolin Kung Fu... is on the north side of Shaoshi, in the forest of Wuyu Hill. Shaolin Temple was founded in AD 495, more than 1,400 years ago. On Wuyu Hill, there is the Dharma Cave. Legend has it... that Dharma sat in this cave with his face to the wall for 9 years. During that time, his image was projected and etched... into this rock. It is now known as the Shadow Rock. The rock is now in the Hall of 1,000 Buddhas. The Hall of 1,000 Buddhas is the most interesting hall of Shaolin. The 500 Arahans depicted on the mural are so vivid and diverse. This is where the monks practice. On the floor there are 48 puddle holes, formed by monks practicing at wooden columns. Practice makes perfect. There is a mural depicting practicing monks... in the Hall of White Gown. It's like a illustrated manual of Shaolin Kung Fu. "Curl up like a cat." "Jump like a tiger." These are all clearly illustrated. Experts can tell right away these are real Shaolin Kung Fu. Shaolin Kung Fu has spread overseas since the Ming Dynasty. Doshin So, a Japanese martial arts master, came to Shaolin Temple 40 years ago. From the murals, he created the Japanese Shaolin Style with its myriad of moves. There are now over 1 million pupils in Japan. May 1980, Doshin So... took his wife, daughter and his best pupils... to Shaolin Temple. A plaque was set up to commemorate this visit. He considers himself a pupil of Shaolin. There are many legends about Shaolin. This film is based on the legend of... "13 Monks Rescue the Emperor" as drawn on the murals. THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE Shaolin, Shaolin How many heroes adore you Shaolin, Shaolin How many wonderful stories mentioned you Your martial art is the only one in the world The Shaolin Temple is famous everywhere Its history lasts forever The Shaolin Temple is splendid The thousand year-old temple The mystic place The valley of Songshan Every person dreams of the original place of martial arts The charming place is well-known everywhere And will be praised forever Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin "Shaolin Temple" Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin Novice monks of Shaolin, Abbot Ya Chi Lai suffered for you... and by his sacrifice, you have been purified. Now I will teach you our ten commandments. They will teach you to respect yourselves and others. Chen Yuan, will you become a monk? I will. Thou shalt not kill. Do you undertake this vow? Chen Yuan, do you vow not to kill? You work or you die! There were uprisings after the Sui Dynasty ended. Adventurers fought over the empire and divided the spoils. The traitor Wang Jen Tse took Tung Tu for the usurper, Emperor Chang. His reign was one of pure terror. Li Shi Min's army is at Hwango. What use are these weaklings! General, strong men are hard to find. We're reduced to using dying men. Bring the prisoners, including Mighty Leg Chang, to me. Move! That's enough! So, you're Mighty Leg Chang. Soon, you'll be Broken Leg Chang! Father! Look out! Chen, get away! - Father! - Run now! Father! Begin. Who's there? Buddha be praised. Abbot, more people arrive every day fleeing from the war. Soon, we won't be able to feed them all. To help others is the obligation of all Buddhists. Buddha be praised. Start telling these people to leave. They must not remain here. Abbot, this boy is seriously wounded. He needs help. He will bring us great trouble. - Jen Jih, it's our duty to save his life... - Silence. Abbot, this man is unknown to us. I have a bad feeling about him. Since Wang Jen Tse took over, he's killed many innocents. This has caused great unrest among the people. Abbot, it is the duty of Buddhists to show mercy. Let him stay! Save his life first, then we'll decide if he can stay. Buddha bless him. Do as the Abbot has commanded. Even though he'll bring us trouble. Master, he won't drink. He's too weak. Nourishing food is so scarce. Maybe we can't save him. What's going on here? Speak up! "Fast as wind, sturdy as pine, light as a bell, still as earth." - Well, what are you doing? - We... we're practicing toad kung fu. Stop that! You've broken our rules. You'll all face the wall for three days! What now? Why are you following me? What are you laughing at? Keep up this insolence and I'll get mad. You beast! Master, kill it. That is a sin! That is a sin! Set it free. Sure, I know just the spot. Buddha be praised. - Buddha be praised. - Master... - Master, I have sinned. - How? I've committed murder. "One who saves a life lives in heaven." The frog would be grateful to you. - Are you sure? - Monks never lie. I understand. - Is it painful? - No. Thank you. I just... We will talk when you have recovered. - Master, congee soup with frog. - Wu Shu sent him two eggs. She is a very considerate girl. - Master, how does it taste? - You should know. Smartass... The sun rises from Songshan The morning bell wakes the birds The streams runs along the woods Grasses are green on the hillside The fruits smell sweet, the flowers look pretty The dogs hop, the rams run Hold up the whip and flick softly The song drifts along the mountain Take care! Go on, Wong. Come on then! He's really coming! Get him! I'll go back for more. How pointless the life that knows only eating and sleeping. "How pointless the life that knows only eating and sleeping." Hey, come on. Wake up! Wake up! He's dead. Who's there? It's me. Why are you here? I was taking a short cut to get water. Nobody is allowed in the sacred burial grounds without permission. Go! I didn't mean to kill you. The least I could do is bury you in such a beautiful place. It seems a waste to bury him. Even the spirits would be tempted by the smell of this meat. - What sad lives monks must lead. - Youngster... - Brother... - You are still weak. This meat will help you regain your strength. You're not a monk. Outside the temple you do not have to observe our rules. Go ahead, eat. Did you eat meat in the past? This is usually cooked with ginger and wolfberry fruit. But this is the first time I have seen it prepared this way. You must be exhausted from caring for me. You need nourishment too. Buddha be praised. As a Buddhist, it's a sin to even think of it... but it's hard to resist. Nobody will know. Go on, eat! Master! Master, at Shaolin Temple, we work more than we eat. It's tiring, and we're not allowed such food! Here, you have a piece. Master, let's eat together. These men became Buddhists to avoid hardship, so they're not the most devoted of priests. It tastes good. Master, aren't we going against Buddha's teachings? "With Buddha in your heart, wine and meat are nothing." We must have Buddha in our hearts and help people. - That's okay then. - Shih K'ung realized this long ago. - Brother, he... - "Devotion never dies." Shih K'ung... Wine only adds to your sadness. Don't get drunk. We've eaten Chen Yuan's food, so we must repay him. Master, monks have nothing, so how can we repay him? Shih K'ung, are you hurt? He's drunk. What a fool. - Brother, he... - He looks drunk, but he isn't. Looks drunk but isn't... Then, it's the "Drunken Staff". Years ago, his wife discovered she was pregnant. He was so happy he bought a large vat ofwine to celebrate. But his wife was killed by the warlord Wang Jen Tse. Instead of drinking to his good fortune, he drowned his sorrows. Now, he spends his days getting drunk and mourning his wife. That led him to create the "Drunken Staff". He has such good kung fu. Why doesn't he take revenge? - Alone? Impossible. - Someone's coming. Hide! Scram! Buddha help me resist temptation. Here, Wong! Here, Wong! Miss... - Have you seen my dog? - Yes, here... - You killed my dog! - No, I didn't. Let me explain. No! Give me back my dog, Give him back! Keep this up and I'll hurt you! You would dare raise your hand to me?! I've let you hit me only because you're a girl. If you carry on, I'll hurt you. - Father. - Father? Why have you attacked him? - He wounded me first. - Miss, I didn't mean... Whatever you say, I won't forgive a dog-eater! - So you won't forgive me either? - You? I also ate the dog. Father, why do you protect him? He only recovered so quickly because of your eggs and goat's milk. Thank you. If the food was so good, why eat my dog? - What shall I do with her... - Is she really your daughter? She lost her mother when she was a baby. At the time, I was being hunted by Wang Jen Tse. I had to take refuge in Shaolin Temple and leave her with a farmer. The old man spoilt her because he was childless. I must kill Wang Jen Tse! Teach me Shaolin kung fu! The temple says it can only be used for defense and forbids its teaching to outsiders. Then, I'll become a monk! - Thou shalt not kill. - It bit me. The temple's door is open only to the pure of heart. This man seems to enjoy killing. The temple must not accept him. Buddhists must be merciful. Chen Yuan has been willing to cut off his hair. He has proved his worth. A man willing to do evil will be willing to strive for goodness. You must strive to help others. Chen Yuan, what's the matter? I've been here nearly three months. I fetch water and chop wood, but when are you going to teach me kung fu? Only three months? Look at your brothers. The speed of their hands, the power in their feet. - This takes five years of practice. - What?! Five years! - Practice kung fu and forget revenge. - I understand now. Chen Yuan, good! - Stop! - Stop! Shaolin kung fu is for defense, not attack. It seems that you enjoy killing. Face the wall for three days! Brother! Brother, do you want to be punished again? Get back to work. If killing a mosquito is a sin, how can I avenge father? If I can't learn kung fu, why be a monk? - Being a monk is not that easy. - I can't take this anymore! Master, please forgive me for leaving you. Miss Pah, I owe you a life. I will repay you soon. She's pretty. Let's take her! Crazy bitch. Kill her flock! No! Thank you. - General, try the ram's penis. - No, damn it! Am I meant to try these aphrodisiacs with this hag?! How insulting! - General, I've brought you a game bird. - Game bird? Excellent. But watch out, she's a wild one. - A wild one... - Sir! A youth has wounded several of our men. How is it you're not dead yet, boy? So, you're a wild one are you? Well, this will just make it all the sweeter. - Chen Yuan! - You here? Look out! - He's drunk. - Yes... Drunken Sword. - What about you? - I must take revenge. - Waking up? - You really are seeking an early grave! Let's go, quickly! Li Shih Min? Move! You're bleeding. - Thank you. - No, thank you for saving me. Miss Pah, are you still angry with me? - Angry about what? - I owe you a life. A dog's life for my own? Surely that's a bargain. - I didn't kill Wang. - He has too many bodyguards. Dad is a good fighter, yet even he has to hide in Shaolin. - You'd better return there. - But I sneaked away. So you're back! I knew you would return. - You missed us! - It's better being a monk, isn't it? Well, it's taken us years to achieve it, but you've done it in just one day. Well done, little brother. Master. Master! Please punish me. You still have much to learn. Nothing worthwhile is gained without effort. You are lucky to have returned alive. Are you hungry? - Drink. - Drink up. Thank you, Master. Learn well from your brothers. He's got no way to go. Catch him! - It's you. - My gracious Saviour! They've got too many men. Don't fight with them. Here is a cliff. Come with me. Kill him. Let's search! Don't you dare to stop us from catching the prisoner. This is T'a Lin holy land. No admission without permission from our abbot. Bald-head, you are looking for death! Stop it! No fighting! Abbot. Buddha be praised. General. This is land for burying Shaolin monks. Even King Cheng will respect this land. Why do you want to fight, General? A prisoner of King Cheng is hiding here. I want to have a search. A little bald-head has helped the prisoner escape. If you don't let me search, the king will blame us. Will you dare to take the responsibility? T'a Lin is our holy land. Please dismount your horses and go inside for your search. Alright! Come with me. Guard the road and go search separately. Master! Here. Chase! Keep guard here. Run up the hill, and don't look back or I'll kill you. Go! - What are you doing?! - Helping you search. - Damn it! - They're getting away up the hill! To the horses! So you're Li Shih Min, who sneaks into the enemy's camp alone. Thank you, Miss. We've not eaten for two days. Dig in! Surely now that you're a monk, you can't eat meat? "With Buddha in your heart, wine and meat are nothing." Monks always have Buddha in their hearts. Here. - Life as a monk must be difficult. - It is. Wang's soldiers are everywhere. You'd better stay here for a few days. Thank you, but I'm on a mission. I must cross the river. Do you know a shortcut? - We'll escort you across the river. - How will we get past the soldiers? Don't touch my hair. You were destined to be a couple. It's a pity you're a monk. - What now? - Let's go. What a pretty bride. Yes, it's a pity you're a monk! Sir, it's getting late. The bride and groom must return to their room. We really must be off. - If you're fooling with me... - Let me buy you a drink. Stop your games! Let me buy you all a drink for being so understanding. - Okay, you may go. - Thank you. Thank you. Don't be so suspicious, brother. Let's go quench our thirst. - Does it hurt? - No, here. Tear it off quickly. It's bleeding. - Why laugh? - You look like a sweet little wife. Thanks for saving my life. I'll repay your kindness. - Li Shih Min, you're trapped. - Bowmen! The general wants him alive. We'll get promoted and a pay rise for this. Take them alive. Take him across the river. Hurry! Hurry! Fire! Master! Master. Baldheads, do you dare defy us! Buddhists don't have the guts to kill. Let's go! - What do we do? - We defend ourselves. - Buddha shows no mercy to devils. - Understood! Chen, kill him! - You'd dare kill! - There's no Buddha for bandit scum. Buddha be praised. Forgive us. Chen Yuan merely helped them on their way to heaven. - Buddha will forgive us. - Surely! Chen did this for the good of us all. I know I have committed a grievous sin. But they would have killed me if I hadn't defended myself. Your soul can never now be with Buddha. From this moment, you are no longer a Buddhist. Master! Go far from us. Master... Wang Jen Tse is waiting in the temple for him. You will be held responsible if you let him go. Mount up! Get on your horses! Master, Buddha is merciful. Please give me another chance. To the temple! Master! Master! Master! Don't let him enter! Master! Go now! Master! Wang is inside. Get away while you can. I can't let the Order suffer because of me. Master! - Bind him and take him away! - You and the Abbot saved my life. I can't bring disaster to Shaolin because of my actions! I regret that I can't help. You have three days to hand over the monk and Li or the temple burns! Now we're in big trouble. I said I had bad feelings about Chen. - We shouldn't have let him stay. - Buddha be praised. All Buddhists have a duty to be merciful. Chen Yuan is my disciple and we are obliged to help him. You've been a Buddhist for many years, so how can you say what you do? - You disappoint me. - I humbly ask forgiveness. General! - Have you news of Li and the monk? - We... we found them. - Where are they? - The monks helped them escape. The monk called Chen Yuan decimated our patrol. Traitors! Traitors! We'll burn Shaolin Temple to the ground! - Shaolin Temple is in danger. - Master, let's fight them. Yes, let's fight!! We have trained for this moment. We must protect the temple! Master! Master! Let me face them. I am responsible for everything. So, you are responsible! Will you fight Wang's army alone?! You are too eager for revenge. It's better if you join Li Shih Min. But Master, I must repay your kindness... I'm a Buddhist monk and have nothing to worry about, except for my daughter. Father! Take care of her in the future and I'll have no more worries. Master. Look after him and no matter what happens, don't come back. Go now. - Father! - Master. Abbot! Abbot! Wang Jen Tse's army has passed Shao Shih Shan! They'll be here soon! If we have peace of mind, then nothing in this illusory world can harm us. - Why are you so afraid? - Buddha bless us, Buddha bless us. - Tell the monks they must not fight. - Yes, Abbot. We lay siege to Shaolin. Not a single monk shall escape! - Kill! - Kill! Buddha be praised. By what authority do you attack our temple, General? "Because the monks of Shaolin have conspired with Li Shih Min, they shall be punished and the temple burnt to the ground." - Burn it down! - Wait! - Do not deny me a last request. - Speak. The stones of this ancient temple are not guilty of treason. And the punishment should not extend to the monks. As Abbot, I take full responsibility. Very well, I'll kill you first. Light the pyre! Abbot! Abbot!! Tells me where the traitors are... and I'll leave the temple in peace and spare the Abbot. Abbot. Kill! - Speak now or you all die! - Abbot! - No Killing. - Abbot! - Kindness means nothing to evil. - "Kill the devils and enter heaven." Is there no end to man's sorrow? Abbot! Brother! Brother! Brother! - Master, you killed! - They deserve it. They deserve it. Kill them! Bowmen! Master! Master! Father! - Father! - Master! Master! Bowmen! Burn the temple now! Master, Li Shih Min's army has crossed the river. You... must defend... Shaolin... and uphold justice. - Kill them! - General! Grave news. Li Shih Min's army has breached our defenses. Onwards, onwards! Chen Yuan, catch! Chen Yuan, do you vow not to kill? I will not kill, except when upholding justice. Thou shalt not steal. Will you undertake this vow? I do so vow. Thou shalt not covet womankind. Will you undertake this vow? Master, on your grave I make this vow: to defend Shaolin and uphold justice. Do you undertake to renounce womankind? I do. Do you vow not to touch alcohol? I suggest that vow be overlooked. Your Majesty. Since His Majesty desires it, the vow of abstinence from alcohol is not necessary. Emperor Li of T'ang Dynasty offered the Shaolin monks... many rewards for their bravery. All the monks would accept was a gown each, a tea set and forty acres of land. The Emperor allowed Shaolin to form their own defense force. Such is the legend, recorded on a temple stone, and bearing the royal signature of Emperor Li Shih Min. The martial arts of Shaolin began to flourish... and Shaolin kung fu was to become immortal! Shaolin, Shaolin How many heroes adore you Shaolin, Shaolin How many wonderful stories mentioned you Your martial art is the only one in the world The Shaolin Temple is famous everywhere Its history lasts forever The Shaolin Temple is splendid The thousand year-old temple The mystic place The valley of Songshan Every person dreams of the original place of martial arts The charming place is well-known everywhere And will be praised forever Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin THE END
