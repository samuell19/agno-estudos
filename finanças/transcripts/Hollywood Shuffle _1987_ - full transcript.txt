Think it was good? Oh, I don't know. I think we can do better. I'm Jimmy's main squeeze! Please don't hurt him. He's all I've got! And then they said I wasn't black enough for the part. You know, sometimes I think that white people don't think that light-skin blacks can play street hoods. Same thing happened to me. I was at a casting call once, and the receptionist asked me what I was here for. Then she asked me if I was black. Oh... But now I'm working. I use suntan lotion. Stop trying to kiss me! Get your hand off my leg! Get your leg off my hand. The director said, you have to meet me at my house... At 12 midnight. Girl, I ain't stupid. I was there at 11:59! Ok, 3:30 is fine. Thank you. Name, please? Uh, Bobby Taylor. I have a 10:30. Bobby Taylor, you're reading for Jimmy. Do you have your sides? Yeah. Great. Just have a seat. We'll get to you as soon as we can. We're running behind. Just have a seat. Ok. This is Sidney Stewart, the director. Mandrill man vacuum, the writer, of course, I'm Millicent Ross. What we're looking for, miss strickland, is the girlfriend of the brother of the main character. She has to be tough, but sensitive. She knows life, and yet she's very naive at the same time. And, of course, she has to be very, very Spanish. We're looking for a very westside story kind of look. Ask her if she can do the Spanish. Do you do a Spanish accent? Yes, I do. Could you do, maybe your sides, for me with that accent? Sure. Jimmy! Listen to me. You better run, honey, before the polices come. That's very good! Wonderful! Yeah, it's very exciting. Richard, it's an important film. And it's a film that can make the right actor very, very famous. We're looking for charisma. We're looking for sex appeal and yet innocence. We're looking for that certain je ne sais quoi. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I think so. With that in mind, Richard, I want you to start reading from the top of the page. Ok. And I want you to give it to US. But really give it to US. Tell him to relax. And relax. But I need some tension at the same time. But not too relaxed. But don't forget to give me sparkle. Can I start? Please. Please. Anytime you're ready. Ok. This is Jimmy, man. Jimmy! Yeah, when my gang finds out, you be dead! Time out, Richie. Anyway, after getting my degree from the royal academy of dramatic art, I decided to come to Hollywood and do some movies. Good. Why don't you start with the speech? That's very interesting. Sure. Ok. Uh, let me see. What it is, bro, I ain't afraid of you. What is happening with your cool vibes? Thank you. Thank you very much. You're the worst actor I've ever seen in my life. I--i have to be frank with you. I could do it in iambic. You be messin' with the wrong dude, bro. Thank you. I got-- thank you. Thank you. Did you like it? Very much. Leave the sides with the receptionist. Thank you. No. Leave it up front. Ok. I'll see you on the shoot. Long distance. Well, how can she tell how-- no, 'cause I have an analyst appointment at 7:00 at night. Could she feel more black? I know, then I have to go to the hairdresser. Do you have the final say on whether I get cast or not? I'm directing the film. No, I can't, mom. No! Listen... Yeah, go on. I'm sorry. She's distracting me. I just can't go through it. No, no. Go on. Maybe 7:00? 8:00. 8:00? All right, 8:00. Thank you. I understand-- I understand you're looking for a tough girl. I can play a tough girl. Thank you. I said I can play a tough girl! Thank you. Wonderful. I ain't be got no weapon. Why you be pullin' a knife on me? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [All laughing] Wonderful. Did you know i'm in a real gang, man. I don't play no Hollywood bullshit, man. Like, you know, I'm for reals, man. And that's why I know I can all right. Play the part. All right, Mr. Rodriguez, that's it. Put the knife away and get the hell out of here. Vivian, get security. [Reading to himself] Don't give me jive, Turkey! This is bullshit. Wh...what? This is bullshit. What are you talking about? This is some more of the white man's stereotype for black man. Yeah, brother. Really? Yeah, brother. Only an uncle Tom would do this shit. They just looking for somebody to sell out. Sell out? The only role they gonna let US do is a slave, a Butler, or some street hood or something. Don't sell out, brother. Don't be a Butler or a slave. Receptionist: Jesse Wilson. Jesse Wilson, you're next! That's me! Good luck, brother. [Laughs] [Overlapping chatter] Butler or slave. [Whimpering] Stop it. Stop it! Hear? Now, you said you want your freedom! You knows we ain't gonna have no freedom back there. W-What if we get caught? What if we get caught? Boy, I'll kill you if you don't stop that crying. And I'll kills anybody else that stands in the ways of freedom. Now, we ain't goin' back! That gang not our home! So let's move! I can't waits to get my freedom. Mandingo, i's go anywhere with you.

Or was it Tuesday? I, uh, I don't know. Jasper, i's don't wants to go. I's a house nigger, Jasper. What? Jasper, don't you wants freedom? We goin' to promised land. The promised land. Promised land?

You right, man, I dig. Both: Real brothers. Snap. Whazzup, man? Welcome to sneaking in the movies. My name is speed, and this is my homeboy Tyrone. And we are like, uh, movie critics and shit. Well, not really. Peep this. Each week, me and my boy, you know, we go to different theaters and stuff and sneak in and check out the movie. Then we come back and tell y'all whazzup. Like if y'all should pay money and shit. Today, the first movie we will be reviewing is a classical movie called amadeus meets salierius about 2 motherfuckers really into music. And here's the clip. [Mozart piece plays] If I could sear out my eyes... Tear my music from the skies and hearts and souls of every human being that has ever heard it... I would give anything to have him back into my soul-- thine eyes, thine heart, and whisper no more. But to be without him, the skies will see no more than nothing. [Laughs] Bullshit! I didn't like this movie at all. My first problem was the fact that I couldn't say the title. I get tired of titles I can't pronounce and shit. If you want people to come and see it, a motherfucker gotta be able to tell his woman where he gonna take her. You gonna lean over to your woman and say, I'm taking you to amaduh, amaduh, you know what I mean? I didn't like it. Here's the next clip, Chicago Jones, temple of doom. Aahh! Got any other bright ideas, Chicago? Let's jump. You gotta be crazy. Trust me. Are you sure? Yeah. I can do anything. Let's jump. Ok. You ready? 1... 2... 3...go! Aah! Aah! Chicago: Are you ok? Just a run in my stocking. Let's go. I'll start. I'll start. I'll tell you, I enjoyed the first and second Chicago Jones and temple of dooms, you know. I kinda gave the guy points. It's a little unbelievable, but it's possible, you know. I know he's a bad motherfucker and all, I know that. Right, right. But him jumping off mountains with his mother, you know, and not getting hurt... No, that's bullshit. I disagree. I disagree, homeboy. I believe this movie. A dude could jump off a mountain and not hurt himself because he did brace himself. And he knew something about the levels of gravitivity and polarity. What? No. That's bullshit, man. That's bullshit. Aw, man, you don't know shit about science 'cause you dropped out of high school. Hey, man, why you gotta bring that up? 'Cause it's the truth. Hey, I know it's the truth, but that--hey, man, fuck you! Oh, whatcha gonna do about it? Hey, man, I'm gonna bust your ass. Oh, yeah, after the clip. Ok, yeah. Ok. Well, right now, we're gonna review this next movie, the new movie 'bout dirty Larry. All right, what do you punks want? We want a helicopter. We want a helicopter! All right, I'll get you a helicopter. Larry, am I glad to see you. They got hostages. They wanna go to the airport. All right, just keep the SWAT team back. I'll handle it. All right, why don't you punks freeze and drop your guns on the ground? What'd you say, honky sucker pighead jive Turkey fool? I said drop your guns to the ground. Make US, cop. It's 3 of US, and just only one of you. [Laughs] Well, why don't you meet my friends? Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson. Wow, that's a big gun, man. Yeah. It's not just a gun. It's a .44 Magnum. It's the most powerful handgun around. No shit. No shit. Yo, man. How much did it cost? About $300. I'm not sure though, I got it on sale. How many bullets does it hold? Six. Woman: Larry. What? I got a cramp in my leg. Let the lady go. Why? Because. Because why? Because I say so. Who are you, man? He's dirty Larry. That's right. We don't care. You take one step, and you're gonna be talking to your maker. Go on... Make my day. [Gunshot] Bullshit. I didn't like this movie at all. Realism is very important to me. Say, like you take somebody hostage, you all nervous and shit? They ain't got time for no conversation. That's right. He's having a conversation, they chill out and listen, 3 brothers with guns? He's supposed to take the money. Right. Take the ho. Take the ho. You know that. And take the car and get the fuck out of there. I can't believe it, 'cause he would've been dead a long time ago talking that shit. "Make my day." Right, right. 'Cause as soon as he said make my day, boom! Do 50 bullets in your ass make your day? Ha ha ha ha ha. You know. Hoo hoo hoo. Shit. Bullshit. Well, that was bullshit. Now, the next clip, I think you will enjoy. Yeah, it's called attack of the street pimps. Check it out. Uhh! No! What is-- you should've seen him. They-- they got Randy. You gotta run. Randy? What's wrong with her? Shit! Girl, watch where the fuck you're going! Oh, god, you scared me. I thought it was them. What are you talking about? Them! Girli don't see anybody. Neither do I. Listen, you gotta run. You gotta hide. They were after me and verne and-- listen! Ha ha. Shit, man! That bitch lost her mind! Her pimp done drove her crazy. He done hit her upside her head once too many. Mm-mm. No. I never seen her act like that before. Oh, man. She had another fight with t-bird. He probably beat her ass good. No. Shit! Oh. Move it. Come on! Ah-ah-ah-ah... Oh! Where's my bitches? No, Jimmy! Oh, god, sugar pie. You don't need that. No! No! No! What's your phone number, baby? Show me. You're gonna get it. Aaaahhh! Now that was a good movie! I love this movie. It was genius. The direction, the acting, the story line... That shit was bad! The motherfucker scared the shit out of me, man. That shit could really happen. I believed this movie. Like, you get all those pimps together, walking around and shit, with big hats on. Right, right. That was live. The director captured the essence of street life in a whore-type situation. Pimps looking for hos. It was live. And that actress that played the ho? Wasn't she good? She was excellent, marvelous, effervescent. Yeah, man. Oh, and acting all terrified and shit. This movie is like a nightmare. You know that one dude, man, with the yellow suit on? Yeah! Man, he looked like this dude right around the corner from my house, man. That's what's so horrifying about it. [Exhales] And now, to recap the movies we saw... We both gave thumbs down to that classical shit amadeus meets salierius. We disagreed on Chicago Jones. I gave it a thumbs down, but he liked it that full of shit. Dirty Larry, the movie where the crooks wait for Larry to go in his jacket, pull out a big-ass gun. What'd they think he was looking for? His American express card? Damn! We both gave dirty Larry the finger. The last movie, we really enjoyed. It was full of stereotypes but it was well directed, and we thought the combining of the zombie pimps and the street hos was brilliant. We gave it the serious high-5. And that recaps all the movies we saw. Well, join US next week when we will be reviewing like, 5, uh, new movies. That's if we can sneak into movie theaters and check 'em out. Yeah. So see y'all next week. See you next week. Let me see your tickets. Uh, I think I lost mine, man. Oh, shit! I think I left mine in the bathroom, you know, 'cause I was taking a piss. You can't hold it in your hand when you're pissing. You know you can't. Let's go. Come on. Speed and Tyrone: We'll see you next week. Mr. Wilson: Where's my bat? I'll show you! Say what? Woman: Mr. Wilson! Wings, don't fail me now! Batty, batty, batty! [Music plays] Wings, don't fail me now! [Music plays] [Laughs] [Laughs] [Telephone rings] Hello? Who's calling? Yes, sir. He's here. It's for you. Who is it? Your agent. What does he want? I don't know. [Sighs] Hello, Marty? What did they say? They like me a lot. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But what? They want a Eddie Murphy type? What's an Eddie Murphy type? Oh, they want somebody to act like Eddie Murphy? Why can't I just act? So I didn't get it. I got a callback? I got a callback? Well, why didn't you say that in the beginning? Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, just call me back with the details. Ok, Marty. Bye. Have a good day. [Hangs up] I got a callback. You got a callback. I got a callback. Good boy. What we're looking for is an Eddie Murphy type. We want somebody who can act like Eddie Murphy from head to toe. That's what we want. Someone who can dress like Eddie Murphy, to look like Eddie Murphy, to be Eddie Murphy, to give them the actor himself, a murphyectomy. To have a Murphy-like quality, murphyesque, to be murphonic. O-tay! [Chomping gum] Just shut up. Hee hee hee hee hee hee. H-Hello, kids. It's your old friend, Mr. Robinson. Me! There he is! He's the one we want! [Chomping] I just want to be me. I don't want to be Eddie Murphy. I just want to be me. I just want. I jus--hee hee hee hee! Yes! Get the fuck out of here. That's what we're looking for. [Muffled screams] [Eddie Murphy laughter] Donny: Man, I am tired of this bullshit! Now, look. You come in here every day with another excuse so you can go out and do that acting thing. I'm tired. I don't want to hear it no more. Now, you sell that shit to Mr. Joe. Don't bring it here, baby, to me. 'Cause we're trying to run a business, ok? Now, look. I don't want to bust your bubble, but you ain't never gonna make it at the acting thing. I have seen you on TV, and I'm telling you now... Let me wrap it up. Hey, man. I saw a film you did on TV the other night. It sucked, Bobby. Give it up. You'll never be a step 'n fletch. Never. You don't even know nobody famous. Nobody. Nobody. Who do you know? Your uncle, he tried. Look at him now, sweeping up hair in a barbershop. That's right. You got a opportunity here, man. That's right. After 5 years, they let me lock up the place. You thinkin' a studio gonna let you lock up the place? This man got responsibility. You could have responsibility. Look, man. Look at me. When I first came here, I was nobody like you. 3 months later, assistant crew chief. 6 months after that, crew chief. I went from $2.00 to $2.25 in 6 months. Now, we talking about making it. Give the acting up. Give the acting thing up, man. Bobby: I'm not going to be working here all my life. I'm going to make it as an actor. Winky dinky dog. Donny, you stupid little pea brain. And tiny, all you care about is food. I'm gonna come back to this place one day somebody, you'll see. [Echoing] You'll see, you'll see, you'll see. Come on, Donald. Give me half a hotdog, man. No. Hey, man, am I half owner in the place? Yes. Well, give me my half a hotdog. I said no. You already ate half my hat. Look, we only got 2 hotdogs left, man. What, do you want to eat one, throw off the inventory? Bobby! Donald, tiny, it's been a long time. Yeah. What, 10 years? Man, we've been watching you on TV and the movies. Always knew you was gonna make it, man. Didn't I always say he was gonna make it? Tiny: Yeah, yeah. Sure did. How's Mr. Jones doing? Uh, hey, he lost his shirt on that ho cake thing. He's over in that corner, talking to himself, going plum crazy. Hold on a minute, damn it! Let me put out my napkins. How you gonna eat without no napkins around? Got to have some napkins. Hold on now. What kind of hcake do you want? You want the wine ho cake? Yeah. Tiny: What happened to this guy? Lost his mind, man. Yeah, Stevie! How many do you want? Michael wants some, too? Ha ha! Yeah, I know. Ho cake. Everybody love ho cake. We need you, Bobby. We need you, man. Could you do a commercial for US, Bobby? I know you can't tell, but business really ain't doing that good. Could--could you, please? Please, Bobby. Could you please do a commercial for me? Tiny: Please, please, please! So, please, please, please get your shit together or you're fired! You can have winky dinky dog. I quit... Crew chief. Fat boy! He be back, man. Yeah. Keep your hat. You're gonna need it. He'll be back. That's damn right. And when you come back, it'll be for less pay! Hey, Bobby, come on in! Just getting ready to close up the place. How's it goin'? Aw, it's goin'. So, yeah, Bobby, what's been happening? How's grandma and the family? I quit my job. I was working there for 3 years. And you should have quit 3 years ago. That job was just a waste of your time. You've got to do it while you're young, Bobby, before you fall in love and get a family. 'Cause if you don't, time's got a way of creeping up on you, kicking you in your ass. What if I'm not that good? What if I don't make it? What if you do make it? And what if you are that good? Bobby, you'll never know until you try. You gotta give it your all, Bobby. You got to give it everything you've got. I know... 'Cause it happened to me. I stopped believing in me, started listening to all those other people tell me what I couldn't do. I kept listening... And listening... Until one day I started believing it... And I quit. Lost my chops. * oh, there was magic in the night * man, when I was singing, I was the happiest man alive... On stage, doin' it. Bobby, there ain't nothin' to it but to do it. You could be the greatest actor ever born, doin' Shakespeare on the stage, playin' the hero in some movie. Maybe the first black Superman. One day, win that Oscar. You gotta believe in yourself, Bobby. Don't play yourself cheap. Don't ever let anybody take away your dream. Come on, let's go. I said, my main man. No, no, no, no. You gotta say, my main man. My main man. Yeah. Excellent. That was real jive, Robert. Yeah, I was like the street, like, "what be happenin'?" Right. All right. You were wonderful. Shit! Shit! Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Stewart. [Laughs] Robert, very, very nice work. Very nice work, Robert. We're very pleased. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Bye! Bye! Fabulous. Oh, my god! Do you want me to call his agent? Oh, absolutely. That's our Jimmy. That is our Jimmy. Jive, tough, charismatic. That's our Jimmy. Very black. [Crickets chirping] * take me back to yesterday * * when a dream that's come true wasn't far away * Bobby, are you trying to get me drunk? No. Mm-hmm. [Laughs] Where's everybody else in the house? I don't know. Mm-hmm. They went out. Where'd they go? They just went out and left me here all by myself. [Laughs] And then you came. Uh... Hi, Lydia. Mm-hmm. Grandma, aren't you home kinda early? Well, I didn't want to play bingo all night, listening to a lot of gossip. Where's Stevie? He's spending the night over at Michael's house. Grandmother: Mmm. How come you home? Uh, we were celebrating. Didn't mama tell you? I got the part in the movie. Oh, yeah, she told me. Congratulations. Why didn't you go out? Uh, my unemployment check didn't come today, and so we decided to just stay in and watch TV. There's this good detective movie that's on tonight. Oh, well! I just love detective movies. Announcer: Welcome to the Wednesday night movie. Tonight, Sam ace is back fighting crime. This movie will be shown with no commercial interruptions. Bobby: This is Sam ace. Yeah. I've seen it 3 times. Sam: This is the city. My city. This is where I work. It's a tough beat, but somebody's gotta do it. I'm a private investigator. My name is Sam ace. I fight crime. It was Friday night. I sat in my office, waiting on the phone to ring. [Ring] Could it be one of my dames? Nah! It was some fag. It's a long story. I was drunk at a Christmas party. Suddenly, there was a knock on my door, then she walked in. I could tell by her shoes, this dame had class. I could tell by her purse she didn't have much money. And I could tell by her face she was desperate. My name is Debra Jenkins. I need your help. Have a seat. My brother was murdered. The police found s body in a alley 2 days ago. All he wanted to do was dance. [Music plays] His name was Carl Jenkins, but everybody called him cookiehead. He was the best breakdancer in the country, Mr. Ace. Nobody could copy his moves. He had a unique style. He was poetry in motion. He was the best. My fee is $50 a day, plus expenses. Mr. Ace, money is no problem. If you find my brother's killer, I'll give you anything. Sam: When she said "anything," she meant it. She was talking about doing the nasty, and I like doing the nasty. So began the case. I started with the people closest to cookie first. His mother. She said he was a good boy. She just hoped he had on clean underwear when they found him. I didn't know how to tell her...He didn't. I talked to cookie's father. He didn't believe cookie was his real son. I didn't know how to tell him...He wasn't. Cookie favored the milkman. I was getting nowhere. I needed answers. It was time to play rough. All right. So I didn't see nothin'. But I could tell you this, though, Mr. Ace. If someone was gonna kill cookiehead, it'd have been Jerry curl. Who's Jerry curl? He hated cookiehead like he was a afro. Where can I find him? He live up on 39th street. Just follow the empty activator bottles to his crib. Ok. If he's not there, ace, he hang out at this dance studio. Dance instructor: 7, 8, and 1, 2, 3, 4. Sam: There was a dance class going on. A funny thought came to me. Could a guy in a skirt kick my ass? I doubt it. Dance instructor: And one! One! Hey, not bad! Sam: The class was over with. I had to move fast. Excuse me. Do you know where I could find Jerry curl? Jerry curl. What do you want with Jerry curl? Just need to ask him some questions. Questions about what? Cookiehead Jenkins. Man: Cookiehead Jenkins? Yeah. You was a friend of his? Yeah. You could say I was a friend. Ok. Uhh! Now, who else wants some? I want some. [Knuckles crack] I want some, too. You want some more? You want some more? Get out of here! You want some more? Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Whoo-aw! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-aw! Whoo! Whoo-aw! Oh-aw! Uhh! Who sent you here? Your mama. Yeah. Smart ass. Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Yeah. Smart aleck! Get him out of here. [Spritz spritz spritz] You looking for me, punk? Sam: You must be Jerry curl. Yeah. How'd you guess? I need to ask you some questions about cookiehead Jenkins. I don't know nobody named cookiehead Jenkins. And don't be coming around here asking for me no more. [Coughs] Sam: Jerry curl had won the first round, but it wasn't over. I was gonna make him pay, not for kicking me in the stomach, but for dripping activator all over my suit. My cleaning bills were a bitch. I headed back to the office. The door had been open. How? Who? Why? Just the lady I wanted to see. Sam, what happened? You come in my office with this song and dance about how your brother was almost an angel. I got on the streets. I got 200 suspects that wanted to kill your brother. Now, what kind of game are you playing? What can I do to show you that I'm being straight with you? Sam: I knew exactly what she could do, and she did, too. As she walked toward me, I saw that twinkle in her eyes. I knew it was time to do the nasty, and I like doing the nasty. She was a good kisser, but her breath was stinking. But so what? You don't get rid of a rolls Royce because it has a dent in it. I'd never done it before on my desk. I was just glad to be on top. I'd hate to do the nasty with a stapler up my ass. I headed back to the dance studio. I knew Jerry curl was lyin'. I had to make him talk. [Spritz spritz spritz] Yo, man, that guy just moves, man. Pass the move over to Jerry. 1... 2, 3, curl! Take it lighter. Go, Jerry! Good one, Jerry! Go! Hey! Funky! Don't lose it! That's it, Jerry, baby! Jerry curl! You're rockin'. [Claps] Sam: Jerry curl! You here for another ass whipping, man? No. Just some answers. Nick, Eddie, get this punk out of here. Back up! Hey, that's my activator, man. Back up! Back--back up, back up, back up. Ok, now, just put my activator down, man. Where were you the day cookiehead got killed? I was at the hair salon, man. I was getting my curl done. I was there all day. Where? Ok. I wasn't there all day, man. Afterwards, I went out on crenshaw and bought me some hair care products, man. I got some activator, some glycerin, and some curl activator, man. I ain't never went down to the beach! You went down to the beach and you killed cookiehead Jenkins, didn't you? No! Yeah, I tried. I tried, man. I put the activator down on the board. I wanted the dude to slip and fall, but he turned into a breakdance move, man, I swear. I--i didn't kill him, man. And that's the truth. Yes! It's the truth, man, I swear! Please! Please give me activator, man! Aah! Please give me my activator. Please? Oh! Aah! Aah! Please! Please! My activator! Please, I swear! Give me my activator. [Frantic spraying] Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Sam: 2 days later, Jerry curl confessed to the murder of cookiehead Jenkins. I had solved the death of a breakdancer. Oh, and by the way, Debra got the money from the insurance cpany, $100,000, and I'm in love... With the money. I wonder how long it takes to spend a hundred grand? See ya next week. I'm Sam ace. That's the kind of role I wanna play. You will. I feel nervous about tomorrow. It's your first day. Naw, that's not it. I just feel funny doing this kind of character. I just wish it were something different. You'll be fine. You think so? Mm-hmm. Is my grandmother still asleep? Yeah. Good. [Funk song plays] * rags to riches * ooh-ah we're talking with fans outside the Bobby Taylor concert. 10,000 seater. What do you think of Bobby Taylor? Basically, you know, I'd pay to see any of Bobby Taylor's movies. * hard work * hard work * and dedication to what you feel * * thank god * thank god * American dreams can become so real * ha ha. I'm Bobby Taylor. Thank you. No pictures now, please. * overnight sensation * Stevie: My big brother is very important to me because I love him. He is an actor. He's been on TV and everything. He can act happy or sad or real cool. He is the greatest. I just wish the boy would get his life together. Mama, don't you start. They're hiring down at that post office. They pay good pay down there. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mama, look, Bobby has a dream of becoming an actor. Just be happy for the boy. Oh, hi, sweetheart. Morning, ma. Morning, grandma. Hi, baby. Ma--ma, could you hurry up? I don't wanna be late for my first day of shooting. Bobby, I'm doing it as fast as I can. Ma, the director says it's ok if you wanna come down to the filming today. I know, sugar, but mama may not be able to get down there. All right. But I'll be there. Ok, grandma. Now don't get me wrong. I am happy for Bobby. But I don't want no grandson of mine out there trying to act like a street hustler. Black folks got enough negative images without my grandson out there adding to that mindless bullshit out there. Mama... Yes, I said it. Bullshit. Bullshit! Mama, if you don't be quiet, that boy gonna hear you. I don't care. Every time you look at TV, always somebody acting like a pimp or some tired-ass nigger. Kids don't need to see that stuff. Acting like they think it's cool to be in a gang. Just the other day, I saw Stevie walk around the house, trying to act cool. Huh! Mama, everything you saying is right, but it's work. There's work at the post office, too. Humph. What's happenin', big brother? I wanna be just like you. Got 3 chicks waiting in our car for US, man. Come on. Come on! Let's go. Come on. What did you say? I said good morning. Yeah. Good morning, Stevie. Woman: Ok, pick me up at 4:00, honey. Bye-bye. I love you, Amanda. I love you, John. I adore you. You're everything to me. My heart beats for only you. And I for you. Your lips. John, no. Can I help you? Man: No, no, no. Joe, bubee, baby, sweetheart, I'm your agent. Listen to me. This is a great deal. I said no. No. It's your contract. No, no, no, no. I'm not just gonna kill 38 people in this picture. This script needs to be rewritten. If this picture's gonna be a box-office smash, I need to kill more people. I'm the hero. It's a 38-kill deal, Joe. That's the deal. That's your contract. Yeah, and why can't you make it 39? Joe, originally, it was 15 kills. Woman: I gotta get a new wig. Sidney, talk to this man. I can't talk to him, Sam. He's a moron. You're never gonna work in this town again. Yo, young blood. Stage number 7. Dressing room's on the left. Thanks. Man: Is that up here? Wardrobe, Mr. Taylor. You have a good one. Hey! My man from the audition, right? Yeah. Hey, what part you playing? Jimmy. Oh, so you got Jimmy. Congratulations, man. Come on, give it up. Heh heh heh. Hey, I only got one line, you know. Hey, but that's cool. I understand the naacp is gonna picket this movie 'cause somebody read the script. Mm-hmm. But I'm glad you got the part 'cause I would never play that part because of my values. But, hey, I'm different. Congratulations, man. Ha ha! Thanks. Bobby: The naacp... Could picket me... [Echoes] No more Bobby Taylors. Reporter: I'm standing outside the home of Bobby Taylor, the young black actor who took a lead role in a stereotypical movie about street life. The naacp has picketed this movie, but this is the first time that an actor's ever been picketed. Here to explain is the president of the Hollywood branch of the naacp Mr. Jamal Harris. I hope that you're all paid-up members of the naacp Hollywood branch. Thank you. We felt we had to put our foot down by making Bobby Taylor an example. We feel the black actor should not have to accept these stereotyped roles, such as crying slaves, tar babies... Tar babies? Jungle bunnies. And I say that as long as black actors play these roles, they'll never play the Rambos until they stop playing the sambos. Thank you, Mr. Harris. Here's Bobby Taylor's little brother Stevie. Wait a minute. I'm not finished. Isn't this gonna be in Spanish? How do you feel about what your brother has done? He's not my brother. He's just a guy that lives in the same house. He's a renter. But you were seen down on the movie set. Isn't that true? No comment. If you print that, I'll sue. I don't have a grandson anymore. I really don't. And what am I gonna do about it? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it. I am going to write me a book about him. A book? Mm-hmm. What's the name of it? Bobby dearest. You used to work with Bobby Taylor. Could you tell me, was he always an uncle Tom? Yeah. Yes, always uncle Tom. Mama, daddy was a Tom. Uncle was a Tom. I think that Bobby Taylor is a two-bit, goat-smelling spook obviously from the coon repertory theater of america. Uh, eat Tom turkeys on Thanksgiving. I'm so sick and tired of people like Bobby Taylor coming around and influencing the kids. Got my kid grabbing his wallet, shining shoes. You ain't gonna be no star, Bobby, on account of that brown stuff on the tip of your nose. I know you're brown-nosing over there. We are out here sweating like niggers going to the election in Georgia because he chooses to buck his eyes, yank on his dick, and pull those raggedy, skid-Mark drawers out of the crack of his black ass. I have nothing else to say about Bobby Taylor. Bobby Taylor is a coon. Be a star very soon. How do you feel about being with Bobby and his film career? I believe him, and I will stand by him. How do you really feel? I will stand by him. Come on, sister. As a black woman, you mean you're happy with your boyfriend with that watermelon smile? I'm proud of my race. And, no, I don't like it. I really thought he was gonna make the right choice, but obviously he didn't. I didn't know that he was gonna act like some sort of piccaninny. My girlfriends are laughing behind my back. They ask me, "does he make those kind of faces in bed?" Do you make those faces in bed? Sometimes. I have thought about it and thought about it. And I have come to one conclusion-- we kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill Bobby. Kill Bobby. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. [Echoes] Cut, cut. Sidney, they are tearing the heart out of my chest. What are they doing to my words? These are my words. Street, street. You hear the man, right? You hear the man. You're killing his dialog. You're killing his words. This is supposed to be street, you know? Now let's get another scene in. Let's go again. A.d.: Actors, actors, come on, first positions. First positions. Jivetime Jimmy's revenge-- scene 10, apple one. Director: Action. Actor: Come on, Turkey. Go get Jimmy. Go get him. All right. [Gunshot] Johnny? Uh-uh. Tommy? [Cussing in Spanish] Johnny, you kill him. Yeah, you right. Gee, Johnny, you kill Tommy. Yeah, you know I'm a bad dude, Jack. Gee. Yeah. Girl: You better run before the polices come. Johnny, it's Jimmy. Jimmy. Oh, no. Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. Talk to me, Tommy. [Stammers] I'm mad. All: Ohh! I wants revenge. All: Oh, no. My pacer's pissed. All: Ohh. Aw, good god. Tommy, hit me. Unh! 2 times. Unh. Unh. On the good foot. Tommy. Camel walk, Tommy. Afros. Yeah! Afros. All: Yeah! I want revenge. All: Yeah. Ohh! I want revenge. All: Revenge. Afros... Yeah? Back it up. You beaners... You back up. Back up. Back up. Girl: You back up. You back up! You back up! You back up! Somebody. You back up. You killed-ed my brother, my main man. I loved-ed this dude, baby. He was--he was, uh... Cut. Why is he stopping? Bobby, that was terrific. That was terrific. W-W-Why'd you stop? What happened? There's no problem. I just forgot my line. Ok. That's fine. No problem. You want to look at the script? No, I'm ok. Great. Ok. Let's go again. Excuse me, Sidney. Before you do, I have another very good idea. Could you tell him to be a little more, you know... Yeah. Bobby, uh, Bobby? I need, uh, a little more black. You know what I'm saying? Like...Stick your ass out. Bug the eyes. You know how they move, you know? Yeah, jive-ass. Jive-ass. Let's slate it. Let's go again. Ok. Sorry--sorry, Sidney. Clap-stick girl: ...Scene 10, baker one. And...action! I loved-ed my brother. He was my main man, baby. Yeah, baby, because I loved-ed him. And, uh, he was my only brother. He--he was like my main man. I loved-ed... I loved-ed my brother. Sidney: Cut. Why is he stopping again? Why are you stopping? I--i--i... I can't do this. What did he say? He said he can't do this. What are you talking about, you can't do this? This is not the kind of acting I wanted to do. This is... This is bullshit. Get him out of here! Get him off the set! I'll have someone else do it. I'll do it. You got it. You ain't shit. Come on, you're blowing it for all of US. This has gotta change. Look, this is work. Shit, there's work at the post office. Get him off the set. I want him off the set. Get him off the set. Get him out of here. [Murmuring] There's always got to be one. Sidney: Get him out of here. Get him off the set. I'll have someone else do it. Uncle ray: You could be the greatest actor ever born. Don't ever let anybody take away your dreams. Alack, they've murdered your only loving daughter. [Sobbing] Fool. Fool! Yes, sire. Come hither. They have murdered my daughter. My ad-- [Thud] Oh, my daughter. Pain. [Helicopter approaches] Man: Superhero... Superhero. We've been looking all over for you. You know this city's full of crime. Get back to work. Back to work. Rambro, over here. Rambro, over here. Help US, rambro. [Yells] And now... [Tears envelope] The winner is... [Finishes opening envelope] Bobby Taylor! Call me. [Applause dies down] This is really a surprise, uh, my fifth Oscar. I'm gonna tell you, I didn't think I was gonna win tonight and against the competition-- redford, Newman, Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, uh, Meryl Streep. I didn't think I had a chance. And I just wanna say tonight, we're all winners. I'll get your jacket, Mr. Taylor. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, there's one line here you forgot to sign, please. Uh, sorry about that. There. There's something about this guy. He's special. He's got this honest quality, integrity. There. Now you look like a star. Thank you. Ok, we're ready to shoot you now. Let's roll. Here's your jacket, Mr. Taylor. Oh, thank you very much. Hook it up and see what happens. Ok, here we go. Take one. Action. Through rain, sleet and snow, I deliver your mail. I'm a u.S. Postman. And you can be one, too. I deliver people's dreams. And more importantly, I have the respect and the admiration of the entire community. And that makes me proud.
