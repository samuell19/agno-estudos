(tense music) (murmuring) (background dialogue) (speaking foreign language) (light accordion music) - France, day one. Philadelphia woman gets rental car and ticket. Tells cop future of Franco-American relations is at stake. - I can't take this. No no no no no. You don't understand. - Daughter looks for hole, wants to crawl into it. - I am not gonna let this ticket get me down. I'm gonna enjoy the streets of Paris, the skies of Paris! If I use traveler's checks at the ticket booth, do you think they'll stiff us on the exchange? - Mom, just stand right there okay? Quit acting like an American. - Oh boy. We'd better find the elevator. - It's not that high. Come on Mom, everybody takes the elevator. (breathing heavily) - I can't believe we didn't take the elevator. But this is good, this is good. If you happen to be 20. - Mom, we're experiencing Paris, that means walking it. - This isn't walking, this is mountain climbing. - Come on, all the way to the top. - [Barbara] This isn't the top? - [Megan] Summit within sight, but expedition forced to make base camp at second level. - Ah. - [Megan] I'll get it, Mom. - Thanks honey. I can't move. - [Megan] Just relax, Mom. - I am relaxed. Haven't you seen a long distance runner drop dead after a race? That's relaxed. - I guess that means you're gonna want to take the elevator down? - Aren't you gonna look at the view? - I'm trying. - Yeah but with that thing stuck in your eye how can you enjoy the sights, the atmosphere? - Sights. The atmosphere. I'm soaking it all in, Mom. - Oh. You know when we were in college, your father and I used to dream about coming here. Sitting where Fitzgerald and Hemingway sat. - Well his priorities sure have changed since then. - I wonder if they paid $5 for orange juice. - Could order wine. That's what the natives drink. It's cheaper. - Do you think there'll be much drinking when you go away to college? - You mean am I gonna get crazy drunk and wake up in some strange motel room and forget where I'm supposed to take the com one final? - Hmm. - Maybe when I'm under stress. Come on or we'll miss the boat. - What a beautiful day! I'm glad we're going on the boat. I'm glad we're together. (mysterious music) - Constancia! Constancia. Constancia, it's me! - Joaquin. - Incredible. Incredible. And more beautiful than ever. Some people thought you were dead. Or perhaps had run off to marry a rich gringo. (laughs) How could you do that to your friends, Constancia? - I tried. I wanted to explain. Oh, I've missed you, how I've missed you. - So why did you run? - Can I trust you? There is so much to explain. Will you ever forgive me? I think we should find a quiet place. (speaking foreign language) - [Tour Guide] Ladies and gentlemen. The River Seine winds through Paris approximately nine meters below the level of the streets. On the left bank we see (speaking foreign language). - [Joaquin] So Constancia. Paris seems to agree with you. - Oh I'm so glad to see you, you have no idea. I've missed you! - I still can't believe I found you again. - Oh yes. (laughing) - [Tour Guide] On the left stands the cathedral of Notre Dame. in 1163 Pope Alexander... (inaudible dialogue) The towers are 68 meters high. The north tower contains 376 steps. (speaking foreign language) (jackhammer rumbling) - Thought you wanted a quiet place? - A private place. (suspenseful music) - For a tete a tete or a deal? - [Tour Guide] For his coronation in 1804. Only the three rose windows retain their original glass. - A lot of money was missing, Constancia. It's not just me who has to forget. We answer to a big family. And we don't keep things from family. [Tour Guide]: (speaking foreign language) - Wow. Mom, get a load of this. - One second, hon. - Just come here! Look, look! Do you see them? Authentic French lovers. (breathing heavily) - But you loved me once. This is another chance for us. - I'm sorry. (gun fires) (groans) - Do you see them? You missed it. (splashes) - [Tour Guide] The new bridge is in fact the oldest of the sagittal bridges spanning the River Seine. Constructed in the late-- - Hey down here! Hello! (exciting music) Hey Mom. - Yeah? - Take a picture of me for a change. - Okay, honey. Smile. You're so pretty. Is it on? - No, you have to turn it on. - Where, here? - The red button. - The red button. - Mom, not everything's difficult. - Wait til you have kids. (exciting music) Where are you pointing that thing? - [Megan] Hunk city. - I know you're past taking advice, but a little subtlety never hurt a woman. - Right. Hey Tex. (exciting music) (honking) - Come on. - [Tour Guide] We hope you have enjoyed your tour on the Bateaux-Mouches. - Hey let me tell you, youth hostels is the best way to see Europe. - Yeah? - New kids every day. Beaujolais Nouveau every night. And party, party, party. - Oh yeah. Yeah. - You know what? Some of us are gonna go down to Lyon on a bullet train. And then we hit the beaches at Cannes. Maybe a little sun and some outrageous fun on the Cote d'Azure? Think you can stand it? - What, the Riviera? - You bet. Wanna come along? - Megan! - Well? Stone fox. She with you? (laughs) - That's my sister. We're just bumming around together. She has this disease. - Allow me. Howdy, ma'am. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) Barbara Brennan. Barbara Brennan. (screams) - Mom. (screaming) Mom please just watch the road! - Oh, oh! - This is insane! Just go for it. - Go for it? We're trapped! Oh my god! Is there a car over there? - Mom, there are 100 of them. - Why don't we forget the car's registered in my name and you drive? - No mom this is great, every man for himself. Just go for it. - Oh my god, shoo, move! - [Megan] Mom. Mom. - Don't talk to me, I'm trying to concentrate. - Alright look out! (honks) Look out! - Why are you yelling? - Because Mom, this is insane, this is insane. - Will you stop yelling! - [Megan] I don't wanna die, okay? - Calm down or I'll kill you! - God, no wonder Dad couldn't live with you. - What? What did you say? - Mom just watch the road. - That was a horrible thing to say! - Just watch the road! - Why are you so hostile? - Hostile? I'm not hostile, I'm bored. Oh my god we've gone around again. What, bored? - [Megan] Mom let me out of here. - I had to work my fingers to the bone to pay for this trip and you call it boring? - Mom, I didn't want this, this was your idea! - You're going away to school for two years, I thought it would be fun! - Fun? This is crazy! - Oh, now I'm crazy. - Mom, look, I'm transferring schools, okay? I'm not entering the foreign legion. You're acting like we're never going to see each other again. That's crazy. - No. Not crazy. Wishful thinking. - Fine, fine, I'm outta here. Abandon me then, abandon me. - Wait a minute! Where are you going? Get back in here. - No. - I've never abandoned anyone in my whole life. - What do you call this then? - Megan. (sighs) (light music) - You seemed a little distracted. I must be getting old. - You? (glasses clink) Never. I'm just... - What is it, my little one? Hmm? Tell me what it is. - Oh it's just... It's just some awful American women. They crash into me in their car. I have one of their names written someplace. They said they had insurance but I was so furious I didn't get where they were staying. - I suppose I could locate their hotel if they are in Paris. - No Bernard, that's asking too much. - You didn't ask. - No not really. It's just a private matter. - And I'll do it. Because I adore you. Now come to me. - Hi. We still talking? - Hmm. I've had some time to do some thinking and I'm going to accept you now as a responsible woman and I agree that you have every right to live your life any way you choose to. - Okay. Listen I apologize for what I said before. - No need to apologize. I've forgotten all about it. - Good. - Organizers claimed the demonstration as overwhelming success. - You gonna change? - To the equality of all people. - For what? - Well I thought we'd-- - Elsewhere today, a gruesome discovery in the shadow of Notre Dame. A man was shot to death. Police identified the victim as Joaquin Prades. Prades was the son of a Panamanian diplomat who was forced into retirement last year because of the family's reputed connections to the South American mafia. - I want this to be our vacation. - Police will not speculate-- - Me too. We'll do whatever you wanna do. - [Reporter] Prades's father, interviewed by telephone-- - Okay. - [Reporter] Said he was shocked and grieved. He said that he hoped his son's killers would be brought to justice. - Wait, Mom, the Moulin Rouge. Isn't that a tourist trap? I mean like a floor show like Las Vegas. - No, like Shirley MacLaine in Can Can or Jose Ferrer when he played Toulouse Lautrec. Besides, we don't have to drive. - That's a blessing. Hey, two American girls out on the town. Parisian men watch out. (laughs) (suspenseful music) - [Barbara] The desk clerk said it's two blocks down and to the left. Or is it to the right? - Here we got French fries being whipped up by, I dunno, he's an off-duty gourmet chef. (speaking foreign language) - Food food... Oh, here we go. On duty we have French business women finalizing a deal. - And somewhere there's a Parisian mother who wishes she'd kept a closer look on her daughter. - Mom! - Put it down. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) I don't know if walking in this part of town, oh my god, is such a good idea. - It's a terrible idea, madame, mademoiselle. Very much fun here. Very nice here. Very nice, beautiful ladies, nice ladies. - No we-- - Very special, very artistic. No cover charge, no no no no no. Okay? - No, okay. - You're American, I bet you! - We are and we're-- - Yes, come in, come in! - Hey! (screaming) (shouting) Call the police, the police! Oh my god. (honking) Call the police, something! (screaming) Police, somebody help us! - What's the problem? - Sir, please, call the police! - Alright madam. What's the problem? - He is the police. - Somebody took my purse, a man took my purse. - What man? Can you describe him? - Yes. He was, uh, well... He was wearing a gold earring, I think. - How much money did you have in your purse? - He didn't actually take any money. - What did your purse look like? I see. That's the purse he took? - Yes. - Yes. (murmuring) An unknown assailant attempted to steal my purse but was unsuccessful. Is that it? - It was an attempted robbery. - I am attempting to help. - Then why aren't you chasing him? - An unknown assailant-- - Thank you very much for your help. - Madame Brennan? Here is the telephone number of my precinct with my extension. If something more concrete comes to mind, please feel free to call me. Voila. - Voila to you too, buddy! - Mom. He was cute, wasn't he? - That's enough for one night. (dramatic music) - Oh my god. - Oh my. (murmuring) (phones ringing) - Why do you suppose the chief works so late? Doesn't have to deal with pickpockets and pimps anymore. Why? Hemery! - Well I never thought about it. - I'll tell you why. Dedication? No. This is dedication. Ambition. And you know what? I don't like him. Have you ever seen his lady friend? - Nn nnn. - What about the townhouse, the country place, or the cars? On his salary? No. His wife's money. And I'll tell you what. It's not fair. It's not fair for one man to have so much. - Alibert. - Me? - Now. (phone ringing) - Oui? Ah. Madame Brennan. (knocking) Here I am. - Is this concrete enough for you? - What is missing? - A light summer jacket. - We didn't see anyone and neither did anyone else. I checked with the desk clerk and he spoke with the maid. - Very good. I take it you don't have jewels. - Well I didn't bring any with me when I came to Paris if that's what you mean. - I assume you're carrying your money with you. - Yes. - That's why nothing was taken. My best guess is that you have been the victim of two unfortunate circumstances. I'm sure these things happen in America. - Yes. But not all the time and everywhere we go. This is not a coincidence! And in America when a citizen is in trouble, the police actually try to help! And even when the citizen doesn't happen to be American the police still try to help! - Yeah. (clock ticking) (suspenseful music) - [Daniel] You want an investigation? You've got it. - Shall I dust the panties? (shutter clicks) I'm running out of film. - Take your time. Good job boys, I'll see you're recommended for medals. - [Alibert] A request will do. - The room has been thoroughly checked. Your presence will no longer contaminate the crime scene. Therefore you may return momentarily. - Um-- - I need to fingerprint you first. - You what? - Fingerprints. I need to compare what I've taken from the room to... I need to fingerprint you. - Alright, we're humiliated, we're tired. You've had a real good time pushing us around and you've kept us up half the night. Congratulations. - Touche. (suspenseful music) (gasps) - There he is! - Who? - The man! The man who took our purse! - Oh my god! - Hey! - Hey stop, stop! (speaking foreign language) - Stop him! - Get him, get him! (shouting) (tires squealing) - Stop, police, stop! - [Daniel] Did you get the license? - No sir, the lights were off. - Get on the radio. (mysterious music) I caused you a great inconvenience. I didn't take you seriously enough. Forgive me, madame. - Apology accepted. - Until I know what to make of these events, caution on your part is certainly called for. - Caution. Is going back to Philadelphia cautious enough for you? - With your permission, madame, we'd like to move you to a different hotel. A place where no one knows where you are. (speaking foreign language) - Does this seem normal to you? - Mom. Why can't you just relax and enjoy it? Maybe the inspector knows the manager's cousin or something and he wanted you to stay in a nice place. 'Cause he probably has a crush on you. - For a guy who started out to be such a pill he sure came a long way. - You came on pretty strong, I was kinda proud of you. - Yeah? Well, he did push all the wrong buttons. Of course he did apologize but maybe we should have gone home. (sighs) - What, because of a couple of mishaps? - At least no one knows where we are. - That's right. Goodnight, Mom. - Night, honey. - Day two. Very nice. The way things should be. Very ritzy, very, oh, there's Mother looking very stylishly undercover. She's a little jumpy in this high-rent district. Thinks there must be a catch. - Hi honey. - Hi Mom. Hey, things are looking up, huh? - We should stay together. Or the more I think of it. We should leave Paris. (suspenseful music) What's wrong? - Oh my god. We were witnesses to a murder. - Yes Captain Abrams, I have spoken with Interpol. And now I'm appealing to the Philadelphia police. Mm hmm. No domestic violence. No suspected addictions. No no no, I'm not suggesting anything at all. Hmm? Okay. Let's get back to Mrs. Brennan. Would a jealous lover have any reason to... Uh huh. Parking tickets. Moving violations. (chuckles) Lousy driver, eh? Oh, mm, thank you very much, Captain Abrams. I do appreciate your cooperation. Bye. Police business. - You were checking up on me. - I have to follow all leads. - I got something you're gonna want to check up on. (suspenseful music) Here, I'll rewind it. You can look at it again. Uh. Oh and this slows it down, frame by frame. - I could tell fairly well the man is Prades, the Panamanian. I didn't recognize the woman, but I will be crosschecking with Interpol as soon as we can get a good rendering to send out. Obviously Commissaire, it will be helpful if we could see the tape on a bigger screen. - Yeah, okay. Um it's pretty easy. This works just like a VCR. Oh I forgot, the French TV system is different, um... You have to get the tape converted. - I can take care of it. With your permission. - Madame Brennan, I sincerely thank you and your daughter on behalf of the French police. I hope this matter has not spoiled your vacation. - Well I guess a vacation isn't a vacation unless something goes wrong. That's why it's so memorable. - The inspector said he put you up in a different hotel. It's satisfactory? - Well. We do feel safer. - The Royal Monsoir. I got them a special rate. - Thank you. (mysterious music) - Maybe we could see like a police lineup, oh my god. Oh here. - Yes, thanks, thank you. Help you. - Alright, let me get a two-shot of you two. - A two-shot. - What? - Listen it's not every day I'm in a French police station, alright? - Actually call me Daniel. - Barbara. - Okay. - Okay. - Inspector. Just pretend you're persecuting her over the parking tickets or something. - Okay. (laughing) - Hemery. May I talk to you for a moment? - Excuse me. - Um... I wonder if he has a girlfriend. - Don't they all? - Inspector, this matter is not in our jurisdiction. You can continue looking after the women, but I'll have to hand the videotape directly to the brigade in charge. - Yes? But what about-- - You know how political these rivalries are. And I'll see to it you get full credit in due time. And I'll always remember that what you've done honors our old precinct. - What's wrong? - Someday he'll be minister of the interior and I'll still be here. He took the tape, told me to drop the case, keep my mouth shut and just look after you. - Hardship duty, huh? - Oh no, no, I mean... A pleasure, most certainly. - Darling, what-- - I thought you might enjoy a movie. - A movie, but, but... A movie? - Converted from this home video taken by some awful American women. - What? - Going away? No time for a nice dirty movie? - But listen-- (slaps) (cries out) - And this time don't tell me about car crashes. Don't ever lie to me again! - Do you know who Joaquin Prades was? - A vile man. And you were kissing him like a slut. Like his lover. - Yes! At one time I was. In a former life, a horrible life. When I came to you for help with my residency card, didn't you ever wonder what I did in Panama? Who I was? Where all this money came from? Don't look away! You always look away! - I live only for the moment. I thought I loved you. - Bernard. If you love me, you have to know me. I faked my own death and I took money. A lot of money. Enough to come here and create a new life, but not enough to buy happiness. That's what you brought. Three years of happiness and I'd do anything Bernard, anything to save that! - And you, you killed this man. - It was an accident! Would you like me to submit to a man like that again? - Dear god. This is not the right tape. - Is this a cruel joke? - But in my office I saw. Hemery gave me the evidence himself! - He kept the real tape. Then he will talk. And I will die. Because Prades people will hunt me down. - Hemery gave me the wrong tape. - He must already know who I am, my connection to you. He is trying to set us up. - Us? All I did was help to find these people. (suspenseful music) - I'm in this up to my neck. And you, my darling, you're in this up to your heart. Don't you see? You work so hard to get where you are. You have so much to look forward to. It would be terrible to lose it all now. When all you did was love me. We have to get the tape. And if your inspector and his American friends can identify me without the tape. Oh, Bernard, we have to get the tape. We have to get them. Where are they? - Come on let's go. - Ronnie, wait for me. What's the rush? (murmuring) (laughs) (speaking foreign language) - Daniel. (speaking foreign language) - Hello. - Hi. This is Luc. He's gonna show me the sewers of Paris. Like in Les Miserables where Jean Valjean escaped. - Monsieur. - The sewers, eh? - Yes, or the flea market. Atmosphere, you know? - You are throwing me over for a younger man? I had my heart set on taking you out today. We should stay together. - Well I've seen enough tourist stuff. - Perhaps we can all go together. - I'll see what's keeping my mom. Excuse me. Mom! - Yeah? - Mom come on, everybody's waiting. Listen I met this guy at breakfast okay so be nice if you could act like you sort of like him. Okay? - I'll give it a try. - Oh Mom, not pants. A dress, something soft and clingy. - You're telling me about soft and clingy? You wore chrome and hot leather to the prom. - Mom I think Daniel would like it if you wore some heels. Typical. - You suppose that's what your father thought? - What? - When we had that fight in the car you said you knew why he left. - Well who cares? There's someone waiting for you downstairs. - He can wait. This is important. - Well not to me it isn't. - You're a lot like him. - What's that supposed to mean? - And the more he wanted to leave, the more I tried to keep him. (sighs) - Look I talk to him maybe once a month, okay, and that's if I call. I get a birthday card on a lucky year. I don't know why he left, I don't know what he thinks about you, I don't even know what he thinks about me. Okay? - The problem was between your father and me. It wasn't your fault. - Look. What's past is past. So why don't we just try and forget him? Oh god. Mom. I gave Daniel the wrong tape. - Bonjour. - Hello. Oh, Megan gave you the wrong tape yesterday. This is the right one. They got switched somehow. I suppose you're gonna have to take it to the station? (laughs) - I think the owner of the precinct can wait a few hours. My chief was very clear. My orders are to watch you. Here they are. - Oh Luc, this is my mom. - Hi Luc. - Shall we go? - Yeah. - [Daniel] Flea market is very spread out. Do you mind a lot of walking? - I love walking. Yesterday I was just telling Megan how can you see Paris unless you walk? (speaking foreign language) - It's called a flea market because of the vermin that infested the secondhand goods. The turn of the century they still had cases of bubonic plague. - Mom, here, take a picture of us. Just look through the viewfinder, push that red button right there. - Okay. - Okay. - Let's see, why don't you, hold on, over here. Okay, excuse me, I'm gonna get right in here. Okay. Now stand still. Oh, day three. Philly coed braves black death with real Frenchman. - [Megan] What are you doing? - It's movies, I'm moving it. - Mom. - [Barbara] Smile. - Oh look. Okay wait, here Mom, hold my bag, hold my bag. - Okay. He is a cutie. (singing in foreign language) - God, did you see those hats? - Those look great on you. - Ooh, that one's great. What do you think? (laughs) - [Luc] Fantastic. - Mom'll die. - Escargot, that's the only French I know. (laughing) - I'm glad we came here. I don't get to flea markets much back home. Probably because there aren't any flea markets back home. (suspenseful music) I hear they've got some great ones in New York, I mean among other things. - [Luc] You're talking too much. - [Megan] New York's probably where I'm gonna end up. There's no way I'm gonna stay around where I live now. - We'd better find them. - Okay, I'll check back this way. - Alright, I'll meet you back here. - Okay. - [Megan] Nearly there, just a sec. - [Luc] Let me see you. - [Megan] Like it? - Lovely but you should keep quiet. - Megan? - No, no, no, no! - Oh my, oh my! - No, no! No! - Megan! Help! Daniel! Megan! (dramatic music) - No, no, please god! (shouting) Oh god! No! - Oh, oh! Megan! - Hey! Hey you, stop! You, stop, police! Get off! - Hey, hey! - Madame Brennan, please follow me. - What have you done to my daughter? - Walk. You'll find out soon enough. (groaning) (honking) (gun fires) - Hey! (speaking foreign language) Give it back! - Where did the lady go? - That lady? - Yeah. - A guy with a gun, a silencer, grabs her. - What guy? - What's going on? - What guy? Where is she? - Gone. She got away. - Where? What did the guy look like? Where did they go? - You're the police, how do I know? (radio static buzzing) (suspenseful music) - Move! Move! - I've told you what I know! - Move, move! - My bike! - Move! (explodes) (screaming) (singing in foreign language) - Police! Somebody! Somebody help me, police! Police! Please sir, stop. Telephone, telephone! (honking) Hold it, hold it! Oh, oh! (phone ringing) - Hello, oui? - Inspector Hemery. Is he there? - He's off-duty. - No, no no, he was with me! - Oh Madame Brennan. - Has he reported in? - That he was with you? - No, about my daughter. Please, please, I must speak to the commissaire. - Well I don't know if-- - For god's sake, this is an emergency! - Alright. - Why hasn't he reported the kidnapping? Why aren't the police looking for my daughter? - Obviously Inspector Hemery is still giving chase. And now you've reported the kidnapping. So remain calm. I'll send a man for you at once. Where are you? - I don't know. They must want the tape. Where am I? - You have it then? - Sir. Where am I? - Does Inspector Hemery have the tape? - Sir, where am I, where am I? - Do you see a street sign? - Here, talk to him. - Hello, hello? - This is a police matter. Give me the location of the phone booth. - No monsieur, no monsieur, I have done nothing. My immigration papers are good. - No. No he doesn't understand you. Please, okay, thank you, thank you. - Just get a taxi and we'll meet you at the Royal Monsoir. (dramatic music) - They knew were we were... You. You knew where we were staying. - Madame Brennan. - And Hemery too. - Madame Brennan! - Taxi. - Metro? - Yes, fine, where? (mysterious music) (breathing heavily) - Pretty legs. If you call out, no one will hear you. But if we hear you, we'll gag you. So it's up to you. (phone ringing) - Oui? - Bad news. One of them got away. - The tape? - I have the camera but not the right tape. - I'll get back to you. Your friend is an idiot. - He's not my friend. I have no use for friends. - You, you stay with the girl. We still need her, damn you. Understand. Can he be trusted? - More than him. (dogs barking) - You're the one. You're the one I filmed. Listen I swear I'm not gonna say anything to anybody-- - Be quiet. Who has the tape, Megan? Would you prefer Briot to ask the question? - I don't know who has the tape. I gave the tape to my mom and she was gonna give it to the inspector and I don't know who has the tape. - Next time. - [Daniel] Barbara. - Stay there. Where is Megan? - How did you get in? - The landlady. - Why the gun? - Because one, you and Vandelle were the only ones who knew where we were staying. Two, Luc was sent to our hotel. Three, whoever wants the tape will keep Megan alive until they get it. Four, you better have the tape or five, I will blow your head off because Megan is the most important thing in my life. That's why. Uh uh! Slowly. - I also suspected my chief. If I hadn't, when I got back to my car... You saw me go after Megan. - Nice act. Quit stalling. Where is she? - I don't know. I don't know why Vandelle is involved in kidnapping, murder-- - Save it. Be quiet! - My car was blown up. - Go to the phone. - They wanted to kill me. - Go to the phone! - Barbara, this has gone far enough. I am on your side. - I want you to call the American embassy. - And? - They'll keep the tape until I get my daughter back. - Right now, the fewer people who know about the tape, the more likely it is that Megan will live. - The phone. Don't try anything. - I thought you knew me. When you call your embassy, they will get in touch with my government. Is that what you want? - I want my daughter. (sobbing) I want my daughter. (guns cocking) (knocking) - Oui? (guns firing) (screaming) Go go! Follow me! (dramatic music) Follow me, quick. - Luc. - Next door, next door. (screaming) (guns firing) - Your gun! - Forget it. You've got yours. - It's a toy! - Oh no! (guns firing) Go! - They're coming, go! - Don't think about it. Just follow me. - Okay. (groaning) - Jump, jump, jump! (crying out) My arm, oh! - Oh my god! - Oh it's broken. - Oh! (guns firing) - The gun, you know how to use it? - No. - You better learn. (gun fires) (guns firing) Run! Run! Go, run! - They went this way, let's go. (suspenseful music) (train whistle blowing) (guns firing) - No! Are you okay? - Give me the gun! (groaning) (guns firing) (shouts) Quick, let's go! Go, go! (crying out) I can't go farther. I have to stop. - Sit over here. Sit. - It needs to be set. I've got a knife in my pocket. (ripping) Help me. - Let me help. - Do you know first aid? We need splints. Do you know splints? - Yes. Oh. - You pull until it snaps into place. And don't let go. Okay? Harder. - I can't. - Yes you can. Okay. Tell me about Megan. - She's not what she seems. She hides so much. I feel like I'm the only one who can protect her. - Love of god, pull! - But I'm doing a lousy job. - Harder. - No I can't! (snaps) Maybe we should get you to a hospital. - [Daniel] I can't trust my chief. We don't have the luxury of trusting anyone else. Just do it. (smashes) (alarm blaring) - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - We need your keys because this is an emergency. (mysterious music) - Hello my pretty little American. It's just you and me here now. - Where did you get that? - [Briot] Smile for the camera. - What did you do to my mom? Don't hurt my mom. - Smile. - Oh god. Just let us go home. We'll leave France and we'll never say anything to anybody. Did you hurt my mom? Oh god, stop it. - Maybe I should drive. - How? - Where are we going? - Where does your chief live? Which way? - Fifth exit. (honking) Oh you're good at this. - I've had practice. (honking) - There might be an alarm system. - I'll be careful. Psst psst. Bark. Come on Toto, woof woof. Woof! (barks) (cries out) (barking) - Uh oh Alban. In or out? Hmm, what's it to be? (suspenseful music) (clock ticking) - What in god's name? - Commissaire. - How did you get in here? - I have something you want. And I want my daughter. So if you'll just follow me outside we can discuss the exchange. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yes you do. Otherwise the tape is on the news. - Okay. I need to get dressed. The joke's over. Where is Hemery? (gun cocks) - Right here. You son of a bitch. Give it to her. - You said you had the cassette. - Uh uh. Someone has my daughter. - I'll see that the cassette gets delivered to the proper person. And then your daughter will be set free. - Sure. - What choice do you have? - We can kill you right now. - I know you, Inspector. You are too good a policeman to shoot a man in the back. Especially your commissaire. - Yes? - And I'm a mother, Barney. Does this thing have to be cocked or something? - You pull the trigger. - You still lonely for your mama? Or maybe for your boyfriend back home? I bet a cute girl like you has plenty of boyfriends. Dozens of them, maybe. Am I right? Maybe I could be your boyfriend. Soft skin. You see, I can be very gentle. Most people think I'm just a tough guy. But feel how gentle I am. Do you think you could like me? - That's enough. (gasps) - What's happened, where's my mother? - [Daniel] What's the layout? - Main room, kitchen, four bedrooms, and a bath at the rear. - Where's Megan? Asked you a question. - I don't know, I didn't take care of that. - How many are we up against? - Three. - Move. You make a sound, kill you. Ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) I don't see Megan. We don't know where she is. - Just get me into the house. - Okay. Let's go back. - Haven't you waited long enough? No contact, no tape. They could have an entire SWAT team closing in on us. - Alright. It's time to get out of this. Take care of the girl. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Hungry? Thirsty? Have to go to the bathroom? Light on or off? - Where are they? - Who? - Hemery and the Brennan lady. - But where? - In the house! Get me loose. (groaning) (laughing) - Luc. Put the gun on the table. (gun fires) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Constancia. Constancia! What are you doing? (struggling) - No! No! (laughing) Stop it! Get off of me! Get off! Stop it! Get off! (hits) (shouting) - Are you okay? - Stop, stop! Constancia, Constancia, stop! My feet, ah! (gun fires) Constancia! Constancia? (crying out) Constancia? (solemn music) - Why, Vandelle, why? - I loved her. - She was just scenery. Two lovers kissing. We could have gone home, nobody would have ever known. Nobody. (crying) (honking) Day five, roles reversed. Mother in second childhood. - Do you mind? - Megan, the Arc de Triomphe is over there. - Come on guys. - Isn't this what got us into trouble in the first place? - Arc de Triomphe, right. (light music) Way to go, Mom. - Oh. (laughing) - Hey guys, wait up. (light music)
