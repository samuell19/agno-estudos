Each sailor has his own fate. Everyone came to the sea by his own path No matter what I think about, I always remember that strange story. I have no choice but to tell it to you. - Blue Horizon - Screenplay R. Lankauskas Director V. Mikalauskas Director of Photography Аlg. Mockus Producer N. Bernotas Director of Art А.

Lietuvaitis Tiburcijus - E. Aukstikalnis Pampikas - N. Bernotas Pampikiene - Z. Masiuleviciute Vytukas' mother - B. Kurmyte Lithuanian Film Studio 1957 This happened a few years after the war. Having finished school, I took off to the sea, to my uncle - a boatswain. I enjoyed sailing on the old boat. Sometimes I ferried people across to the other shore. This boat was my fathers most prized inheritance. Such sails! Made by Vytukas himself! Zigmas, have you seen a real ship? - I have not, but soon I will. - Where? I will sail to Klaipeda, to enter the naval school. - He will sail to Klaipeda. - Zigmas, take me onto your ship. Alright, please. You little fool, where will you swim, mother is waiting. - Where? - On the market! The piglet has escaped! Hold him! - Why are you pushing? - Ow! Hooligan! Who wanted with mustard, and who without? Son, how can I thank you? No need, I love catching game. - Thank you! - Helping is a sailor’s duty! - Vytukas, let’s go home. - Right now. How many will you be trying? Excuse me, madam, but there is no trial amount established. Are you talking back? Varmint! - Guten morgen! - You’re a morgen. Excuse me, ein moment, one beer. - Please. - Thank you! Drinking is harmful! Excuse me, mister! Did you catch the piglet? Yes, and what? Please. Ah, one moment. - You’re a sailor? - I used to be… The Storm was raging with force 30, I was torn from the helm… I didn’t get along with the captain. I can’t peel potatoes. I understand, I understand, you’re a big guy. Tell me, please, how do I become a sailor? Hmm, it is very difficult. - Do you have money? - I do. - Give it to me. - Take my 20 cents. - I’ll be right back. - Madam! So you say that you really want to be a sailor? You can’t even imagine how much he wants it. Dreams of it… No every peasant can fire from a cannon. - You need capital. - Capital… I have a saxophone, father left it after his death. A saxophone, you say? Not bad… not bad… Yeah… We can get acquainted. Vaizis Vinzas. Tiburcijus Pranziškus. Vytukas. I think you’ll become a sailor. - Really? - Really, I guarantee it. Look, what a Turkey! He’ll take a picture and run to the village to brag that he’s a sailor! A true sailor is different. Please. I don’t want to be a sailor. I’ll go to the collective farm. Salyukas also wants to be a sailor - Which Salyukas? - You don’t know Salyukas, hmm…? I can’t. Let’s go swim. - I can’t, mother won’t let me. - Just try! Give me a moment… - Saulius, where are you going? - Swimming. Fine, let’s go to the bath. By myself. The guys are swimming in the river, and you’re taking me to the bath… By yourself? Fine. But won’t go to the river… Bye! Saulius lives here. There, his mother! Children, go to the river and I’ll be back soon. - Bring Saulius. - Alright. Hello, comrade Pampikiene! So you’re letting Sauliukas to Giruliai? We must know. Giruliai? No, he won’t go. He is ill. I am well and I want to join the guys! - Get back to the bath! - I’m well! I’ll just run away. But Saulius is completely fine. I won’t allow my child to be taken away from me. He has a predisposition to whooping cough. Excuse me, comrade Pampikiene, but you’re raising the child incorrectly. I said - I won’t let him! - I will be forced to… - Don’t try to educate me! I said - he won’t go! - Saulius’ mother won’t let him. - Who’s his father? - Oh, he’s a big head of trade. - Alright, tomorrow at 11, by the bridge. Stay in touch. - Vytukas! - What? I’m going to get bread. - Look after the piglets. - Alright, mam. - Vytukas! Vytukas! - What? Uncle Burchus is waiting for you by the bridge. I can’t, I’m looking after the piglets Tie him to something. Why are you running late? How long can one wait? It’s not my fault, I have a piglet. You’re a piglet. We need to save Saulius. Here’ s what we’ ll do… - Do you understand what you must say? - I understand. Hello! - Saulius, is that you? - I’m at the phone. Quickly, lie down and pretend to be ill. Why should I be ill? The doctor will send you to the village, that’s where we’ll escape. Ah, understood. Run, I’m dying. Ow, mother, mommy, I’m dying. Here, doctor! Save him, doctor! Just think about it, a naked child ran onto the terrace from the bath. Sit, doctor. - That’s what I thought. - What, doctor? - Do you have relatives in the village? - Yes, Saulius’ aunt. Immediately go to the village! Good, I’ll just phone my husband quickly. - What about medication, doctor? - We’ll take care of it there. - On the big rock, understood? - Understood! Lie down and die! - Ow, mother! - Stronger, stronger! Doctor, I don’t even know how to thank you. It’s nothing. Goodbye! Thank you, doctor! Remember, to the village tomorrow. Judas! Iscariot! You killed the piglet! The piglet hanged itself because of you! Get out of my sight! Vytukas, don’t cry because of that rotten piglet. Let’s go to my grandfather at the farm. I know where I’ll go… Do you, future sailors, know why I called you? No. Before this sacred crusade, before this big journey, we must give the oath of friendship. Get on your knees and repeat! - It’s not laughter and fun! - It’s not laughter and fun... I will give my friend a helping hand in time of trouble, - like a brother to a brother. - Like a brother to a brother… If I break this oath, may thunder slay me. May thunder slay me. - May lighting pierce me. - May lighting pierce me. And may my home soil not carry me alive. And may my home soil not carry me alive. I’ll take various things on this journey, money and… a saxophone. I’ll take various things and a saxophone. More money… - Amen! - Amen! Dear Lord, what is that? Where’s he from? Saulius, why did you get up? You want to be ill again? back to bed! Mommy, I’m completely healthy. I want to go to the yard. Into the yard? Fine, I’ll bring a potty. I won’t sit on the potty, I’m big! It’s shameful, all the guys will laugh! - Now-now, don’t shout. - I’m a sailor! - Don’t shout, here, eat. - I’ve eaten already. Don’t talk shit! If you make fun of me - I’ll run away. - Hi! - Hello! - I heard you’re off to Klaipeda? - Yes, Klaipeda. - On the diesel? - No, by boat. Well, brother, in this atomic age, on such a vessel… Listen, brother, maybe you have no money? I’ll lend you some, don’t be shy. No, no, it’s more interesting by boat. His uncle is a boatswain in Klaipeda. Ah! Listen, my uncle is a captain. We’re basically relatives. When are you setting sail? - At dawn. - Good, we’ll swim together. - What? Vytukas will swim too? - Yes, and we’ll take Saulius with us. - Saulius? Which Saulius? - Lampikas. - His parents let him go? - Yes, and his documents are checked and ready. I was sent here specially from Klaipeda. - I’ll take the children sailing. - Who will take such worms? Sorry, but you don’t know the latest marine laws Now they take them in early childhood, train them to become sailors. Storm, range, helm - understand? Yes… no, I don’t understand - Fine, I’ll take you to Nyumunas. - Good, and there we’ll see. Deal. At dawn. Nobody came to see me off. I have no parents, they died during the war. But I found it strange, that Vytukas’ mother didn’t come to see him off. Goodbye, my native shores, we’ll return with honour. Goodbye, mother, forgive me… On the same day, Vincukas also set off to the farm. Dad, dad, stop, it’s Vincukas! Can you give me a lift? - Vincukas? Where are you going? - To my grandfather at the farm. On the way to the aunt I’ll drop off Sauliukas. Further by yourself, somehow. Greetings, Virgute, greetings! Where’s mommy? Mom is not at home. Ah, not at home… Well then take the guests yourself. Sauliukas, I won’t wait for the aunt. I have to go. - Daddy? - What, sunshine? Look at me. - Did something get in your eye? - No. Alright, listen to your aunt, I’ll come in the evening. I just remember that mom left something here for aunt. - And you, watch the herd. - I’ll try. Alright. What is this heavy thing you loaded? Stones or food? You what? I ran away from home to eat less! Interesting, did nobody see us? - That girlie could give us away. - What does she know! Let’s get out of here! Careful, you’ll capsize the boat, it’s deep here! Don’t worry, I’m here. I’ll save you. And a bottle of rum… Guys, Saulius! - Saulius! - Zigmas! Save me! Tiburzyus is drowning! Save him, Zigmas, pull him out! Guys, take your seawolf. - Do you hear, or not? - Water, water… Is everything ok? Yes. - Is everything definitely good? - Yes, very good. On shore you’re a sailor, but in the water you screamed and sank like a stone… I’ve swam kilometres in the sea, the water is salty there. -Help me. I’m already helping you. I’m paying for the washing and overpaying. I’m not talking about money, help me find my child. Me? You what? The car is occupied, and so is my husband. And why should I look for your child? What am I to do? Where am I to go? Wherever you want. It’s your fault. You have no idea about the education of children. Hitting a child like that… I hit him, but for what? Oh Lord, just because of that piglet. And so the child ran away, everything is as it should be. Did you see how I treat Saulius? Always fair and loving. I just don’t understand how a child could run away from his mother. - Swim alone. - How will we be without you? - Alone? - It’s difficult for me with you. I need to get myself in order. I said - I’m waiting at Nyamunas. - Did you give the oath? - Yes. Well then, sir, know that if you’re not at the right place, I’ll put the kids on a train home. - But we can be separated. - Don’t worry, I’ll find you. We’ll shout: “O-go-go!” - Wonderful, try it all together now. - O-go-go! O-go-go! Excellent! Godspeed and smooth sailing! As soon as we set sail, I understood that I had made a mistake. Why did I take only children? Why did I trust Tiburcijus? Who is he? How did the parents entrust him their children? And why did he suddenly drop the boys? Maybe he needs to get something from the relatives? I don’t know anything about him. He said that he worked in the theatre and sailed the sea. - Good afternoon, Aldona! - Greetings! Greetings! Greetings, sister! Greetings! - I should beat you, brother. - What for? You come so rarely. There is no free time. Oh, my Virgute. Please, come in. Where’s Saulius? Saulius? You need to ask Virgute that. Maybe, you’re joking? - You have my child? - That’s the first time I hear of it… How is this to be understood? - Dearest, did you bring the child? - Yes. - You said that everything was alright? - Everything is alright. - I don’t understand anything. - Dear Lord! My only child… - Virgute, where is Saulius? - Saulius ran there. To the river? Oh Lord! Let’s go! Maybe he drowned? - Have you seen a boy here? - In a plaid shirt? - Yes, and light-haired. - No, I haven’t. - And what if I have? - So have you or have you not? During the unavoidable passing near my orbit, he walked by… Tell me, where is he? Calm down! - I will reward you well. - Are you with the limousine? - Yes, I’m with the car. - All is well, you’ll find him. Ocean! North-east direction! - Furl sail! - Aye aye, sir, furl sail! There is an unidentified island on the horizon! The children, sailing the lake, were so overjoyed, that they forgot about everything in the world, and no matter what they come up with: games, pranks, without a care in the world Comrade commander, may we inspect the unidentified island? - Carry out the order! - Very good! Follow me, come on… Mom! - What have I become? - I said: “Let the boy go to summer camp“. And you gave him into the hands of a charlatan. - I did? - Who elese? - It was the doctor’s will! Yeah, yeah, I know your doctor! Milk! Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest… and a bottle of milk! Coconut milk. Give it to me, give it… What’s going on here? They broke someone’s pitcher. Are we going to scoop the milk from the river? Quickly clean your hovels! Are we spending the night here? Let’s swim to Nyamunas, Tiburcijus won’t find us here. What are you doing here? Why are you so gloomy, have you swallowed a fly? I’d swallow a dog, that’s how hungry I am. Mom is frying some eggs… We need to swim to that shore, my grandfather lives there. We’ll eat and then we’ll be better! Gather your belongings. Extinguish the fire and let’s go. Sailing again… - Take your bag! - It’s not mine. - Whose is it? - Mom and dad slipped it in. - Let’s see what’s inside. - What do I see… What joy, what luck, that this magic bag has been travelling with us. Good that the guys didn’t find it yesterday. - Zigmas, why are you silent? - Doesn’t matter, ignore me. - Vytukas, let’s go to the farm. - I can’t live without the sea… And I can’t live without ships. In the summer we’ll tend to the herd, and we’ll fatten the pig. And when we finish school, you’ll become a navigator, and I’ll be chairman of the farm. And you, Saulius, will be the ship’s cook. You’re the cook, I’ll be a boatswain. - Vinzas, are you getting off here? - Yeah, I’ll go to grandfather. Careful, there's a waterfall going into the sea! Watch out, don’t drown … Don’t worry, I’m also a sailor. Take it and hide it. Open it when things turn bad. - Promise? - I give you my word. And you, ‘Bubble’, a harmonica, so you may always remember. When you’re sad - play it, and remember me. Well, Vinzas, good luck to you. Guys, it’s time for us too. Guys, write me! Vincukas, you write us too! - I’m going to the ship. - And I’m going to the farm. Have a good journey! On the second day of our journey we arrived in Nyamunas. Here Tiburcijus was supposed to be waiting for us. He’ll take the boys, and I’ll calm down. And the guys were also eagerly awaiting this meeting. Louder, shout louder, and Tiburcijus will come down from the heavens. Right then, let's go! There was no other way, the children had to be taken home. I can’t accompany you, I have an exam after-tomorrow. You’ve missed it, the last one has left already. I just wanted to ask you… - Where are we going? - To Paynyava. We can travel with music. - Give me hundred. - How much, how much? - You don’t have that much? - Not that much… I’m joking. I’m not going in that direction at all. Look, the boat has been stolen! You won’t get away with this! I’ll show you how to steal other people’s boats! Stay here! Where’s the railway station? Here, not far. Take your belongings. Come here! Quickly! Sit. Sit and guard it. Take your belongings. - I’ll run away anyway. - I’ll show you how to run away!.. - You’ll see. - You won’t run away from the conductor. Take him right home. Passengers! Quickly, while he can’t see! The train to Paynyava №123, will leave in 5 minutes. Passengers… - He hasn’t come back yet? - Who? Well, him… - That one? - Yeah! - No. - Good! Get on it... How can we leave Zigmas alone? You’re scared of everything. We can row ourselves. Come on! Faster! He’s coming! Get out! Get out of my sight! - What about the things? - Take them to them. - Out! - But I was just guarding them… Why did I act in such a way? But the kids… I spent my last few cents buying them those tickets. And they… Why don’t they want to go home? Their parents are looking for them, waiting for them, worrying… Let’s get back to Zigmas. If we both ask him to forgive us, maybe he will. Look, he climbed under the boat. Poor thing. Why did you run away from home? Hey you! Guys, climb under the boat. Faster! Your sad friends… Vytukas, Sauliukas… Journeying has become even more difficult. The guys couldn’t keep up with me. They were tired and talked about their parents. I couldn’t take them home. And I also couldn’t just leave them. The only thing left was to bring them to the uncle. He’d return them. - Hello! - Hello! - Do you know where the road to the sea is? - No, I don’t. The sea is quite far, behind the forest. - Sauliukas, what are you thinking about? - I want to go home. Interesting, I wonder why Tiburcijus didn’t turn up? Maybe we missed each other? Don’t talk about him! Oh, if only I was to meet him… End of the line. And the sea is so close, behind the forest… Maybe it’s enough? Maybe we’ll go home? Guys, have you seen Vytukas? We haven’t seen him all day. My god, where is this child? If we were big, we’d jump into a moving car by ourselves. - Isn’t that so, Saulius? - What? - Hello, Layma! - Hi, Jonas! I’ve picked some apples for you, what will you bring me from Klaipeda? He’s going to Klaipeda. Quick, quick! We’ll have supper at uncle’s. Saulius, sit, quickly! I want to go to Klaipeda with you. Wait until Sunday, we’ll go with the tour. We’ll swim in the sea… Grandpa, have you seen three boys with rucksacks? No, I haven’t. He hasn’t seen them either… I don’t even know where to look anymore. Dad, dad, dad!!! Dad, stop, wait! How did you get here?! Wretches, I’ll show you… Get in the car! How did you get here? Don’t push, we got here from… - Faster, we need to catch dad. - Maybe it’s not your father? I saw him. Mr Tiburcijus! Mr Tiburcijus! My children! Didn’t I tell you that I’d be there on time? - How we waited for you! - Now we’ll go together. Alright, alright, we’ll celebrate later. Do you know that the police is looking for you? - Police? - Yes, the police. Did you lose the valuables? - But my dad drove past. - We’ll find your dad. - And Zigmas left. - Don’t worry, we’ll find them all. Now we need to hide. Quick, faster! - I don’t want to go further. - Saulius misses his mother. Dupes… Klaipeda is near. Listen, you can hear the sea. We’ll wait a bit until the miller leaves, we’ll get shelter under that winged thing How spooky it is here… Quiet!!! My legs barely carry me… - Do you want to eat? - Yes. I can see that you’re hungry… Tiburcijus, what are you doing? That’s my dad’s golden watch. When the stomach is empty, gold loses its value. Come here! Come, come, come… Are you scared of me? No, I’m not scared. - And now I’ll borrow this thing. - What do you need it for? The soul withers without music. Understood? - Just don’t lose it. - Don’t worry. I’ll pawn it today, get some money, and tomorrow it’ll be yours again. - Give me the grocery bag. - I’m not giving you the bag. - Why? - My valuables are here. valuables? What a good lad you are, didn’t forget our oath. Alright, give me the bag. Do what you want, but I’m not giving you the bag. Whatever. Make sure that nobody steals it. - Well, I’m going. - Don’t forget about us. Don’t worry, I’ll be back on time. How I want to eat… Sauliukas, look what I’ve found!! - He took the saxophone… - And the watch… What if he doesn’t come back? - Three thousand. - For a saxophone and a golden watch? Alright, take four. Pour one for everyone! Beautiful señorita, may I invite you to tango? - Hi, buddy! - Oh, Kazimeras. - What brings you here? - Don’t even ask. Why, what’s up? What misfortune? - Well, here’s the thing… - Sit down and tell me. Good morning! Did you guard the things well? - I’ll bring everything to the captain. - Tiburcijus, don’t leave us! Don’t cry, we’ll drive to the sea in a limousine. - A Ship! - A big ship! Mr Tiburcijus, there's a big ship at sea! On the misty horizon the captain has anchored and awaits us. But no captain will take you without gifts, so I’ll take the bag. - Do you see the harbour? - Yes! Go straight there, I’ll drive around - Mr Tiburcijus, our legs hurt. - Nonsense, somehow you’ll get there. See you! Dad’s car! Tiburcijus, what are you doing? Tiburziu, open the door! Tiburcijus, it’s my dad’s car! - I’ll show you ‘dad’… - Tiburcijus, what are you doing? Saulius, Saulius! What are you doing? Tiburcijus… “Vytukas, open it when everything is very, very, bad… promise?” I promise. “I will wait for you here. It’s me” Vincukas. The driver quickly let me go. And I started look for the children. No matter where I went, who I asked, where I looked - I couldn’t find them. The valuables… Where have you been, you devil spawn? None of your business. - Where are the children? - I don’t need them… Wait! Now we've got you! What’s he doing there? Slippery bastard! Where to go now? I want to go to mother. We’ll hide in the evening, and in the morning we’ll sneak into the harbour. Are we getting up?? Quickly lower it onto the ground! Quickly, lower it! What is this? Get out! What are you doing here? - We… were looking… - What were you looking for? - Zigmas. He brought us here. - Which Zigmas? We were travelling with him to his uncle, a boatswain. What’s this Zigmas’ surname? - Vaitkus. - Vaitkus? Hang on, hang on, so you’re… Yes. Well then, come aboard. You’re good guys, but it’s too early for you to go to sea. Go home now. And to school. - So you’re Zigmas’ uncle? - That's right! Where’s Zigmas now? Zigmas? There he is. His first journey. Who knows, maybe in a year or two I’ll meet these good kids out at sea.
