IN 1992, FISHERMEN PULLED SOMETHING VERY HEAVY OUT OF THE WATER. IT WAS A PREGNANT MERMAID. THE MERMAID WAS BRUTALLY RAPED TO DEATH. SINCE THEN, MOST OF THE VILLAGERS HAVE BEEN CURSED AND WERE DYING. THE REST OF THEM BUILT A TEMPLE AND BURIED THE MERMAID'S BODY THERE. IT ALL HAPPENED ON MIEU ISLAND, OFFSHORE. The horse falls dead Three kings and five emperors Looking for an empire Chi chi chanh chanh The nail blows fire The horse falls dead Have you named the child? Come on! My little girl, come on! Push! Come on! Push, Soi! Come on! Come on! My grandchild! What? Another? This one belongs to him. It's Huynh's. Father, please don't kill my children! I will raise them to be good people. The nail blows fire The horse falls dead Three kings and five emperors Looking for an empire What is Mom doing? It's gross. I find it interesting. Kids, come in here! Help me! Soi! Why are you still practicing this deadly spell? He was dead. My kids have never seen their father's face. Your husband was dead! He was a murderer! He was dead. Run, kids! Grandpa! &lrm;Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Run, kids! Grandpa! Grandpa! Linh! Linh! Wake up, Linh! 20 YEARS LATER What are you doing up in the middle of the night? I couldn't sleep, so I burned an incense for dad. My earring fell under the cabinet. Let me help you find it. Found it! Let me put it on for you. I've been having nightmares recently. You must be stressed out. Should we go on a trip on your birthday next week? Your hair looks so frizzy. I'm gonna take you to the hair salon tomorrow, all right? Let's go camping on the island. We haven't been to the sea for so long. I'm still very afraid of water. That incident is still haunting me. I haven't forgotten Huy's death. It's been three years. You have to try to forget it. I will help you get over it. SUCH A BORING LIVESTREAM! Oh my God! The nails look amazing. Sis took me to do it. - No, I was talking about mine. - Yo, girl! Hello everyone, this is Kim, the youngest member of our group. Next to Kim is Linh, her sister. Here! I would like to introduce Mr. Tam, the main sponsor of this trip. - That's all wrong. - What? You should have introduced the sponsor first. Why didn't you say so? Again? Ah, did you just get your hair done? It looks beautiful. I forgot my hat upstairs. Two, three… I would like to introduce Mr. Tam, the main sponsor of this trip. Hello, everyone! Next to Mr. Tam is Linh, the sponsor's girlfriend. The girl who just ran away is the sponsor's girlfriend's sister. Come on… Who will be next… This is Long, the magician and handyman. Do something, Long… I must have left my phone upstairs. - What, that's it? - Let me go get it! Come on, man! And last but not least is Cuong! The mushroom-head. Call me mushroom-head one more time and I will beat the heck out of you. - I've always called you by that name. - Not in our millions views clip. Ah, sorry, mushroom-head. Hello, everyone! My name is Cuong. I'm the CEO of the travel agency Home is a Place to Return To. We specialize in unique island tours across the country with… Tam, hurry up! - Thoughtful care… - strict security… &lrm;served food… - Now, let the trip… - Begin! We are going to a very beautiful place today. Where is it? Please tell us, Linh! I'm not telling you where we're going to. LONG "HANDYMAN" CUONG "MUSHROOM-HEAD" - HA "FANTASTIC" KIM "COFFEE GIRL" LINH "HOUSEWIFE" - TAM "DOCTOR" OKAY! HOW HIGH YOU ARE! 1, 2, 3, CHEERS!!! IT IS SO MUCH Can you give me these three dollars, rich boy? Sister! 79 is such a beautiful number. Lucky number. Long, try to win lotto for once, so you can get out of this miserable life. Hey, let's switch it with me! 69 sounds sex tireness. The jackpot is two million dollars. Are you sure? Hey, let's take a picture! Yeah! Hurry up, Long! 1, 2… - What the matter with him? - I don't know. He's smiling! What is it, Long? Are you possessed? Cheers! It's so amazing! This island is the most beautiful one around here. You picked such a wonderful place. So gorgeous! Thank you for showing me this place, Kim. Oh my God! The water is so cool, guys. Mushroom-head! Come down here and film me. No way. I'm seasick. Oh come on! Everyone knows you can't swim. There's no phone signal here. That's weird! Maybe the service is down today. What's this island called? It doesn't have a name yet. Hey, we're going to get some firewood. Let's go, Cuong! Hurry up! Hang on! It's all right. I'm here! I saw Huy again. Hey, this place is so strange. Cool! What's cool about a shrine? The spiritual stuff. It'll help us get more views. Yeah! Hey, Cuong! There's a big fish skeleton over here. You can shake it, Cuong. It's shaking! Hey, don't joke around in places where there are many ghosts. You're overreacting. Ha, what are you doing? Ha! Ha! So dramatic! You're chickenhearted. Hey, Cuong! There are writings here. "Shaman practiced Kumanthong, raised, killed to make ghost soldiers." Why is the plank shaking, Cuong? Hey, there are lots of mushrooms here, mushroom-head. There's nothing to be scared of! Hey, look at this! A mushroom! Pick it! Pick it! Hold on! Hey, there's a cellar below. Let's go up! Divide up the wood and make the campfire. Remember to save the mushrooms to grill later. Happy birthday, sister! This is your birthday gift. May you always be happy and beautiful. You fool. Thank you. Try it on! Come on! - Come on! - Slowly! It's okay. It's okay. Be careful! Happy birthday, my darling! I wish you will always be happy. Thank you. - That's okay. - Is there anything to eat? It's well done. Here you go, Tam. This one, too. - Hey, Shark Tam. - Oh, Shark Tam. You want some mushrooms, Shark Tam? Have some mushrooms. They're delicious. Is there anything to drink? Have a drink, Shark Tam. I'm going to grill. Hey, what's the problem? - What are you doing, Long? - Long? - Long? - What are you doing? Everyone, calm down. Why are you so serious? Get your hands off of me! Magic? - Oh my God! - You scared me! What were you doing? Oh my God! You prick. Are you okay, Cuong? That trick was surprising, I must say. Here's your tip. Wow, he lit it up. Oh really? It looks like the fire dancers on the embankment. So awful! Contact him if you need a cremation. My tip for you. Oh damn! What's that? Do you know what this is? It's the lotto ticket we bought yesterday. - It's two million dollars. - Two million dollars. Two million dollars. It's two million dollars. I won the lotto. I'm a millionaire. OMG! You almost fooled me. How could you win a lottery. - He won the lotto. - You're such a joker. Never mind. Let's eat. He is not only a magician but also a comedian. It's done, Cuong. Maybe he ate too many magic mushrooms. - Cheers! - You all don't believe me, do you? Stop messing with us, man. Hey! You can do magic to your phone screen? There's no signal on this island to check the result. I checked it while we were on the ship. I took a screenshot to make sure. JACKPOT RESULT No wonder you laughed like crazy then. That ticket is mine. - Congratulations, Long! - Thank you, Linh. - Congratulations, Long! - Congratulations, Long! Let's drink to celebrate! Two million dollars. - Cheers! - Let's drink! Why did Long win the lottery but we were all so high? Tell us, Long! Why did you win the lotto? It's scary. I'm not telling you. Tell us! So do you know the can ghost? Before coming to this island, I begged the can ghost to win the lotto. Draw a number from 0 to 9. When the cigarette hisses, the can will roll into the number. Long, I have a good idea. Let's play a game where we do what Long says, and if you like it, you give us 10,000 dollars. Our company has been losing money for months. Let's play this game to get some new capital. No, this game is not fun. I'm not playing. We're having fun. Come on. - Just play, for fun. - Okay! Let's play! Long… I'll go first. No, girl. The winning ticket was supposed to be mine. I'll go first. Today is Linh's birthday. Let Linh play! Can I kiss you? Are you out of your mind, Long? Have you gone crazy? - That's it. It's getting tense. - Are you crazy? Pass, next round. This round is tough. Let's pass. That's right. Me! - Make it up for Tam. It's Tam's turn. - Hey! What about me? What's wrong with you? I dare you to tell a secret that you're hiding from Linh. You can't hide it. You can't hide it. You can't hide it. Just say it all. So? Are you afraid? If you are… I'll challenge you with something else. Look at his face. So? I'm hiding one thing from you. What if he had a sugar momma! Maybe he has a mistress. Actually, I'm getting married. Oh my God! Linh! Will you marry me? Oh my God! Bastard! Are you crazy? Oh, come on! It's not fun anymore. Leave it! Get off me. It's not done. What was that? Well! It's not good. Everyone is drunk. Let's go back to the tent. I've known that you've like Linh for a long time. But you're poor, so you don't deserve her. Now you're a billionaire. You're not inferior to Tam now. You can even buy Tam's life. Now that you're rich, you can do whatever you want. You can do as you please. Don't be mad. Long was just drunk. He didn't mean anything. I have something to talk to you about. You're drunk. Go to sleep. Leave it until tomorrow. I'm not talking to you. You want another bottle in your head? There's lots of blood here and here. Stop it! Let me talk to Long for a while. Why did you hide this from me? I was planning to tell you after this trip. But Long forced me to say it sooner. What do you mean? What about me and you? My sister will see us. Your sister can't get up here. Tam! Hurry up, everyone is waiting. I thought you understood that we were just in a FWB relationship. I'm sorry! But I truly love Linh. Shut up! If you truly loved Linh, you wouldn't have slept with me. You're a real fucking prick! I must tell you that… I have had feelings for you since we went to school together, and I still do. You can feel it, too. Don't you? I really like you, but we are good friends, and I don't want that to change. But I don't want to be your friend. I want to be your boyfriend. There's blood on your hand. Linh is my sister. Go out there with her. I'm fine. You don't deserve my sister. Long, calm down! Long, don't you remember that we came to this island to… You think you're so good? Stop it, you two! You think I don't know that you slept with Kim? You! Tam! Is anyone there? Help! Is anyone there? Help! Where are you? Tam! Tam! Tam! - Tam! Tam! - Sister! Help me. Tam! Linh! Calm down, Linh! Calm down, Linh! Calm down, Linh! Let me check on Tam. You take Linh back to the tent. Sit here. Wait for me. I'm going to get the ship captain and will be right back. Tam is still alive. It seems like he is dying. I've checked. Broken skull, broken legs, but he's not dead. What's wrong with you? Suddenly, I feel so cold. Why are you looking at me? I'm afraid of your mouth. Hey, I'm not joking. Everything that comes out of your mouth comes true. You said Long would win the lotto, and Long won the lotto. You kept calling Shark Tam, and now Tam's corpse is here. But you said he's not dead? Look at him, he's not gonna make it tonight. If he's not dead but paralyzed… Long would have to care for him for the rest of his life. It would be exhausting. Sometimes being dead… Stop talking! If Tam dies for real, Long will go to jail. He might even get the death sentence. Come here! It was just a snake. Have you calmed down? Where have you been? I've been looking for the ship captain, but he's nowhere to be found. What about Tam? I didn't kill Tam. Tam fell by himself. I didn't mean to push Tam. His eyelids flipped up. His teeth turned into fish teeth. I didn't kill Tam. I didn't push Tam down. - Long! - I didn't kill Tam. - Long! - I didn't push Tam down. I didn't kill Tam. I trust you. Let's go check on Tam first. I feel there's something very scary on this island… I feel something is watching and wants to kill us all. And Huy's death… Even my father's. Take it! Asato Maa… Sad-Gamada. Run! Run away from this island! - Don't go there! - Tam! Tam! You meant to kill Tam… You found him alive, so you secretly cut his throat, didn't you? No! I didn't kill him. - I've been with Linh the whole time. - You savage… You killed him then pretended to go meet Linh to fool us. Beside you, who else here wanted to kill Tam? I didn't kill Tam. This island is cursed. Stop fighting. Tomorrow, when the ship captain comes back, we'll call the police. I just saw Tam's spirit. He was headless. He said something… "Asato". It was scary. How could he speak if he was headless? He did. He said run. I'm telling you… I believe that this island is cursed. This afternoon at the shrine, there was the same spell. It read that there was a mermaid monster on this island that was killed… then raped… then a female shaman came to take its corpse and its child's corpse to practice Kumanthong. Shut up! Stop talking about such superstitions. Yeah, that's right! There's no evil. Long is a murderer. Tomorrow, when the police come… I will report that he killed Tam. Fuck you! What? You want to kill us to eliminate the witnesses? Stop it! Turn on your Bluetooth. I'll share the clip in which Long killed Tam. Let's see if he could kill us all to cover up his crime. - Fuck… - Calm down, Long! All right… I have an idea. Give us each 250,000 dollars. We will testify that Tam died in an accident that had nothing to do with you. If I didn't consider you as my brother, I wouldn't try to help you. How can you still think about money at this moment? Forget it, Cuong! I think that's a good idea. What are you talking about? Come on, 250,000 dollars is a lot. Okay, Linh! If you don't agree, don't take the money. Report to the police that your boyfriend killed your fiancé. - Fuck you, motherfucker. - Come on! You're a fucking dog. Stop it, Cuong! Yeah, I'm a dog. Then what are you? - Who did you get that ticket from? - Everyone shut up! If Dad was still alive… what do you think he would say to you? Even though we're poor, we didn't have to do that. I'm grateful for you and Dad. If Dad hadn't adopted me, I would have died a long time ago. But you have the properties Dad left for you. I'm just an adopted child. What do I have? You still have me. I can take care of you. Take care of me? You even killed the person I loved. Tam, please give me a number. If I win the lotto, I will offer you chicken, pork, duck or whatever you want. I will take care of your tomb. Hey, Cuong! Cuong! Cuong! Are you possessed? Cuong! Cuong! Where are you going? Cuong! Cuong! Wait for me! Cuong! Cuong! Cuong! Cuong! Cuong! I'm sorry about what happened to Huy. I didn't mean to kill Huy. Huy looked like he was possessed. He rushed in, wanting to kill me. Huy wanted to kill you? But in the end, he's dead, and you're still alive. So what do you want? You want me to follow him, too? Yes! I used to think that. If you had died instead of Dad, I would have had everything, including Tam. That's why you slept with my boyfriend? Don't you know that Tam had slept with me before he was with you? Are you pregnant? Kim! You're hiding something from me, aren't you? This handkerchief… The other day when I was looking for the earrings for you, I found a secret compartment under the floor. Did you use it to harm Tam? That's why he got mad and attacked Long. Your leg is bleeding. Take the towel to apply pressure to the wound. I'm okay, thank you. You used it to harm Huy, didn't you? No! He harmed himself, not me. - A lot of oysters here. - Are you bleeding? - Yes! Are you bleeding, too? - Yes. Oh no. Kim! Be careful. There are a lot of oysters there. Honey, swim with us! On the day my father passed away, did you also lure my dad to this island on the day he died, Kim? Kim, please tell me the truth! Long! Give it to me! Give it to me! You! Give it to me! Give it to me! It's mine! Do you want to kill your friend? You are not my friend. - Cuong! - Long! What are you two doing? Long! Cuong! Don't fight! Cuong! Don't! Don't! Ha! Ha… Wake up, Ha! Ha! Ha! Fuck you! Motherfucker! Fuck you! Linh escaped. I can't find her. - Why are you staring at me? - Where are the other two? Dead… Killing each other for the lotto ticket. That's enough sacrifice. Hurry up! This ceremony can only give us one year to live. Eventually, it will take our lives, as it did our mother's and grandpa's. Run away! Grandpa! Are you going to keep sacrificing people forever to keep us alive? The only way to get rid of it and to see Mother again is to finish what Mother started. We need a sacrifice, a pregnant mother, to practice Mother and Child Kumanthong. - Come here! - Tin! Please spare Linh's life. Spare Linh, Tin! That book made you crazy, Tin, just like it used to haunt our mother. Only by practicing Mother and Child Kumanthong can we get rid of it forever. But Linh is my sister! I'm your only brother. Do you hear me? Asato Maa Sad-Gamada. Asato Maa Sad-Gamada. Asato Maa Sad-Gamada. Asato Maa Sad-Gamada. Asato Maa Sad-Gamada. Kim! I haven't finished the ritual. Where are you going? Run! Kim! Kim! Run! &lrm;Kim! Grandpa! Run! Do you want to meet Mom? The winner will stay on the island to guard Mom's body. The loser will find someone to bring here to be sacrificed for Kumanthong, so we can meet Mom again. Chi chi chanh chanh The nail blows fire The horse falls dead Three kings and five emperors Looking for an empire Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! If you come any closer, I will throw the bottle off the cliff. Give me the ticket! I will testify that you didn't kill Tam. What about the others? A girl with broken leg and a weak girl. We can handle them. Ha! You can't hurt Linh. It's mine! Long! Give me the ticket then I'll pull you up. Save me! - Long! Save me! - Give me your hand! Long! Save me! - Give me your hand! - Save me! Give me your hand! No! It's okay! I'm here. Kim! - Kim! - Kim! Kim! - Kim! - Kim! Kim! - Long! - Kim! - Kim! - Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim! You will die just like your dad. Linh! Linh! Wake up, daughter. Wake up! Only two of you? Has the Kumanthong really died, Linh? Kumanthong isn't real. It's just Kim and Tin's excuse to do evil things. 6 MONTHS LATER The boat was shaking so much. There's nothing to see here. Why did you insist on coming here? I like it here. Let's go somewhere else. Just explore around the area. I won't charge you if it's not beautiful. If you want to, let's go! - You're the best. - Linh! Get some rest, Linh! Let me guide the tour. Everyone, please follow me! JACKPOT ISLAND
