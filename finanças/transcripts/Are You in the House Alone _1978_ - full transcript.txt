UH, I'VE GOTTA SHOW A HOUSE. THIS LATE? YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE GOT A BUYER FOR THE BROOKLYN STREET PLACE? OH! THEY'VE SEEN IT ONCE, THEY WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN. I GOTTA RUN OVER AND GIVE 'EM THE KEYS. WELL, WHERE'S DAD? HE'S IN A MEETING. BUT DON'T WAIT FOR HIM 'CAUSE HE'S NOT SURE WHEN HE'LL GET BACK. M-MOM, WAIT! WHAT DO YOU WANT? I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. GAIL, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS WHEN I'M RUNNING OUT? I CAN'T TALK TO YOU NOW! I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU IF WE COULD CHANGE THE PHONE NUMBER, BUT NEVER MIND. THE PHONE NUMBER? WHY? BECAUSE OF THE CALLS. WHAT CALLS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, GAIL? WELL, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME! OH, GAIL! [door closing] I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THIS. I'M ALWAYS THE ONE THAT DOESN'T LISTEN. WELL, JUST MAYBE YOU DON'T LISTEN. MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME. I HAVE TO HOLD UP MY END IN THIS FAMILY. NOW, I KNOW I HAVE NOT BEEN EASY ON YOU. I'VE BEEN HARD ON YOU LATELY. BUT LISTEN, THERE'S A REASON. I CAN SEE MYSELF IN YOU. I FELL PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH YOUR FATHER WHEN I WAS JUST ABOUT YOUR AGE. WE RUSHED INTO MARRIAGE, YOU WERE BORN. WELL, ARE YOU SORRY YOU MARRIED DAD? NO, I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL. I--I WOULDN'T GIVE EITHER OR YOU UP FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. I JUST WISH THAT I HAD TAKEN THE TIME. THE TIME TO FIND OUT ABOUT MYSELF, ABOUT THE WORLD. THERE'S SO MUCH, GAIL. THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES TO MAKE, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE THEM. I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT ALL. LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GO. I AM SO LATE. I'M SORRY. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER, OK? [door opening] [door closing] [crickets chirping] YOUR FATHER DOESN'T WORK HERE ANYMORE. WHAT? HE GOT LAID OFF, ABOUT A MONTH AGO. A LOT OF THE GUYS DID. WE DIDN'T GET THIS BIG CONTRACT WE BID ON, SO THERE WASN'T ENOUGH WORK. WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. I'M SORRY, GAIL. ARE YOU SURE? HE NEVER TOLD YOU? HE LEAVES THE HOUSE THE SAME TIME EVERY MORNING, LIKE HE'S GOING TO WORK. I GUESS A LOT OF THE GUYS DO THAT. THEY CAN'T GET USED TO BREAKING THE ROUTINE. WELL, THEN, WHERE DOES HE GO? I HAVE TO FIND HIM. I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM. COULD YOU AT LEAST TELL ME WHERE TO LOOK? TRY KING'S INN. KING'S INN, IT'S ACROSS THE STREET. YOUR FATHER USED TO EAT LUNCH THERE EVERY DAY. IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR LUNCH, BUT, WELL, IT'S WORTH A TRY. OK. MISS, I'M SORRY, BUT WE DON'T START SERVING UNTIL 11:30. I CAN'T SEAT YOU YET. OH, I--I DON'T WANT A TABLE. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. THERE'S NO ONE HERE? WELL, THE BAR'S OPEN, BUT... MAY I JUST TAKE A LOOK? I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE. ALL RIGHT. (Gail) WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME HE LOST HIS JOB? COME ON IN, SIT DOWN. HOW'D YOU FIND OUT? DOESN'T MATTER, DOES IT? I FOUND OUT. DOES YOUR FATHER KNOW? NO. WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL ME? BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY YOU. WHAT COULD YOU DO ABOUT IT? YOU'RE TREATING ME AS IF I'M 10 YEARS OLD. AREN'T I A PART OF THIS FAMILY? SWEETHEART, PARENTS WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN. AND MAYBE THAT'S WRONG, I DON'T KNOW. WE JUST-- WE DID THE BEST THING THAT WE COULD DO. WELL, I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE TRIED TALKING TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE. GAIL, YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOUR FATHER THAT YOU KNOW HE'S LAID OFF. YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME. BUT WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS HIS DECISION NOT TO TELL YOU. HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN HIM. HE SEES HIMSELF AS AN ARCHITECT. AND BEING A MAN IS ALL TIED UP WITHIN THAT JOB. HE'S LOST NOW. HE'S LOST. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, CAN'T YOU? HE NEVER COULD STAND TO SAY NO TO YOU. HE WANTS YOU TO ADORE HIM SO. [sobbing] OH, AND SOMETIMES THAT'S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH. I KNOW. NOW, LISTEN, YOU MUST BE VERY ADULT ABOUT THIS, HUH? WE HAVE TO PROTECT HIM NOW. HE STILL SEES YOU AS A LITTLE GIRL. AND HE WANTS YOU TO SEE HIM... HE WANTS YOU TO SEE HIM AS THE, UM, PERFECT FATHER. SOMEBODY STRONG. SOMEBODY TO FIGHT YOUR BATTLES FOR YOU. BUT HE CAN'T ANYMORE, CAN HE? NO. HE CAN'T. DON'T BE TOO HARD ON HIM FOR THAT, HUH? OK, I WON'T TELL HIM. [crying] (Steve) YOU WEREN'T IN SCHOOL TODAY. (Gail) I JUST WENT TO SEE MY FATHER. IN SAN FRANCISCO? YEAH. DID YOU SHOW HIM THE NOTE? NO. I DECIDED NOT TO. YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. IT'S A STUPID JOKE. IT'LL STOP. GAIL, WHAT'S THE MATTER? LOOK, I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. I JUST WANTED YOU TO HOLD ME. IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT? GAIL, YOU WERE THE ONE THAT STARTED... LOOK, OK. I'M CONFUSED, EVERYTHING IS IN A MESS. I CAN'T RIGHT NOW, OK, I JUST CAN'T. I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING. THEN WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE? TO BE ALONE WITH YOU, TO TALK TO YOU, AND BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE VERY PRETTY OUT HERE. [car engine starts] OH, STEVE, I'M SORRY. SO AM I. [people chattering] [school bell ringing] I'M LATE. CAN I HAVE A LATE PASS, PLEASE? [panting] [crickets chirping] [phone ringing] HELLO. (Steve)&nbsp; GAIL? HI, IT'S STEVE. [sighing] HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING?&nbsp; THE KIDS ASLEEP? YEAH, YEAH. THEY'RE FINE. I'M FINE. LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER DAY. IT'S OK. I JUST... OH, I DON'T KNOW, I'M A BIT JUMPY LATELY. AND I GOT ANOTHER NOTE. IT'S WORSE THAN THE LAST. LISTEN, I'M HELPING&nbsp; MY FATHER WITH A JOB TONIGHT, AND HE SAID I COULD HAVE&nbsp; THE CAR AFTERWARDS. YOU WANT ME TO COME OVER&nbsp; AND KEEP YOU COMPANY? OH, YES. THANK YOU, STEVE. OK,&nbsp; ONE FLOODING TOILET TO CURE&nbsp; AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. OK, BYE. [phone ringing] HELLO. [man laughing] (man whispering)&nbsp; ARE YOU IN THE HOUSE ALONE? [clicks] [dial tone humming] [exhales nervously] [dial tone humming] [knocking on door] OH, STEVE. OH, PHIL. OH, HI, GAIL. HEY, IS, UH, ALISON HERE? NO. OH, YEAH? SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA COME BY. THAT'S STRANGE. SHE SHOULDN'T BE WANDERING AROUND AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW. OH, UH, CAN I USE YOUR PHONE? SURE. THANKS. UH, IT'S OFF THE HOOK. HELLO? OH, HELLO, MRS. BREMER. YEAH, THIS IS PHIL. IS ALISON THERE? [laughing] I REALLY HAD YOU FOOLED, DIDN'T I? [groans] HAD YOU REAL SCARED. PHIL, WILL YOU CUT IT OUT? "ARE YOU IN THE HOUSE ALONE?" HEY, UH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU. YOU AND PASTORINIS DOWN AT THE LAKE. I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE. I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU A LONG TIME, GAIL. SENDING YOU NOTES. CALLING YOU, HUH? I'VE BEEN REAL PATIENT. YEAH, WELL, I THINK YOU NEED HELP! WHAT ABOUT ALISON? [yelling] HEY, LEAVE ALISON OUT OF THIS, OK? I'VE WAITED FOR YOU. DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THIS LILY WHITE VIRGIN STUFF, EITHER. 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. [gasping] HEY, COME HERE! OUCH! [groans] [dial tone humming] [sobbing] I--I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SHE... SHE WAS JUST LYING THERE. GAIL! GAIL! WAKE UP NOW, GAIL. THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME? GAIL? CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME? GAIL. GAIL. YOU'RE IN OLDENFIELD HOSPITAL. AND YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE. I'M DR. CARSON. I HAVE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. DO YOU FEEL UP TO IT? THAT'S OK. YOU'RE DOING FINE. DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE, GAIL? HE RAPED ME. WHO RAPED YOU? DO YOU KNOW HIM, GAIL? [whimpering] I CAN'T. I--I CAN'T. I C-CAN'T TELL ANYBODY. I CAN'T TELL ANYBODY, THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME. I KNOW THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME. HOLD ME! HE--HE'S BEEN--BEEN WATCHING ME ALL THE TIME. HE WAS AT THE LAKE. HE WAS THERE! SHE PROBABLY WON'T GET PREGNANT. CARSON SAID THAT SHE PROBABLY WON'T GET PREGNANT. WHO WOULD DO THIS TO HER? I KNOW IT ISN'T RATIONAL, BUT SHE'S A PART OF ME, AND I FEEL LIKE THIS HAPPENED TO ME. YOU KNOW, I--I LOOK AT HER, AND I TELL MYSELF IT'S ALL OVER. SHE'S ALL RIGHT. BUT I CAN'T HANG ON TO THAT. IT JUST HITS ME AGAIN. RAGE HITS ME AGAIN. AND I WANNA KILL THE ANIMAL THAT DID THIS TO HER. HI. STEVE. [sobbing] IT'S OK. IT'S OK. IT WAS HORRIBLE. IT'S OK. I WAS SO SCARED. IT'S OK. YOU OPENED THE DOOR BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ME, DIDN'T YOU? IT DOESN'T MATTER. GAIL. GAIL, DO YOU KNOW-- DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS? IT WAS ALL A BLUR. I DON'T REMEMBER. WHAT COLOR WAS HIS JACKET? [sighs] I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW, UH... BROWN, MAYBE. WHAT COLOR PANTS? DID HE HAVE ON A HAT? GLOVES? NO. IT ISN'T ANY USE. I--I JUST DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE. OK. I WANT YOU TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION AND TAKE A LOOK AT SOME MUG SHOTS. MAYBE YOU'LL RECOGNIZE HIM. NOW, IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, WE HAVE AN ARTIST WHO CAN PUT A DRAWING TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, TALL WITH BROWN HAIR ISN'T MUCH OF A DESCRIPTION. YOU LET A STRANGER IN THE DOOR. YOU STRUGGLED, HE THREW YOU DOWN, ASSAULTED AND RAPED YOU, AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I'VE BEEN ON THESE CASES BEFORE AND THEY ALWAYS REMEMBER. SO IF YOU DECIDE TO GIVE ME HIS NAME, CALL THE STATION. AND IF YOU DON'T, WE DON'T HAVE A CASE. AND HE WALKS AROUND FREE, AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE. PHILIP LAWVER. PHILIP LAWVER RAPED ME. NEIL, STOP, YOU CAN'T GO OVER THERE! (Jessica) THIS IS NO SOLUTION! THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION. THE POLICE WON'T EVEN ISSUE A WARRANT. LISTEN, NEIL, IT'S COMPLICATED. YOU GOTTA LISTEN. LISTEN. IT'S NOT COMPLICATED, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. PHILIP LAWVER RAPED MY DAUGHTER, AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT EVEN IF WE DO GET A WARRANT, THE JUDGE IS A GOOD BUDDY OF JOHN LAWVER'S AND WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. NOW, NEIL, FOR GOD'S SAKE, WOULD YOU PLEASE THINK? I AM THINKING. I AM THINKING ABOUT THAT KID WALKING AROUND FREE, WHILE I CAN'T EVEN PUT HIM BEHIND BARS. WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S NOT A VIRGIN, THAT'S WHY. NO, THAT'S NOT WHY. BUT THIS IS A DIFFICULT CASE, THOUGH, AND THERE'S A FACET WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THEIR LAWYERS DO HAVE INFLUENCE, GAIL DID LET PHIL IN THE DOOR. PLUS THE FACT THAT SHE'S NOT A VIRGIN. NOW, IF WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT, THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY IS GOING TO MAKE PHIL LOOK LIKE A MODEL STUDENT AND GAIL, THE SEDUCTRESS. SHE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING. WHY DID IT HAPPEN TO GAIL? I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT. ANNE, GAIL DIDN'T PROVOKE THE ATTACK. AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN THEM. NOTHING JUSTIFIES RAPE. I KNOW THAT. I DIDN'T MEAN IT. LISTEN, I'M JUST AS SCARED AND FRIGHTENED AND ANGRY AS YOU ARE. AND NOW WHAT HAPPENS? PHILIP LAWVER WALKS AROUND FREE, AND I'VE GOT A CHILD UPSTAIRS WHO WON'T EVEN LEAVE THE HOUSE. NEIL, MY WORLD IS FALLING APART. IF WE ARE GONNA FACE THIS, WE'VE GOT TO FACE IT TOGETHER, BECAUSE I CANNOT FACE IT ALONE. I CAN'T. I CAN'T FACE IT ALONE. [exclaiming] [muttering] I'D LIKE TO KILL YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID TO HER. [Gail sighing] [gasps] [moans] DADDY. IT'S OK. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? NOWHERE. YOU'RE GOING TO PHIL'S, AREN'T YOU? NOPE. POLICE WON'T ARREST HIM, WILL THEY? NOT YET. JESSICA WILL GET THEM TO ISSUE A WARRANT. BUT WHY WON'T THEY? IT'S A SMALL TOWN. THE LAWVERS RUN THE SHOW. AND EVEN IF THEY ARREST HIM, HE'LL GET OUT FREE, WON'T HE? MAYBE. [sighs] I KEEP DREAMING ABOUT IT. AND THEN I WAKE UP AND TRY TO TELL MYSELF IT'S A BAD DREAM, BUT IT ISN'T. WE MOVED HERE, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SAFE. BUT IT ISN'T. IT ISN'T SAFE. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL, YOU HAD A FAVORITE BEDTIME STORY? REMEMBER? HUH? YES, IT WAS ABOUT THE PRINCESS IN THE TOWER. RIGHT. THE PRINCESS WAS LOCKED IN THE TOWER BY THE EVIL KNIGHT. AND THE PRINCE WOULD COME AND RESCUE HER AND TAKE HER AWAY TO HIS CASTLE, WHERE SHE'D BE SAFE, REMEMBER? [laughs] ONLY, SOMETIMES I KIND OF CHANGED THE STORY A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW? THE CASTLE HAD A MOAT AND SOME DRAGONS, AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS. BUT THE PRINCE ALWAYS RESCUED HER. THERE'S ALWAYS A HAPPY ENDING. WELL, IT'S NOT TRUE. THERE ISN'T ALWAYS A HAPPY ENDING. I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT. I KNOW THAT, DADDY. I WANTED TO MOVE HERE TO PROTECT YOU. AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU I LOST MY JOB TO PROTECT YOU. [sighing] AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE REASON THAT I NEVER TOLD YOU THAT SOMETIMES LIFE IS HARD. AND I CAN'T PROTECT YOU FROM THAT. BUT I KNOW THAT. IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT. MAYBE IT'S EVERYBODY'S. I'LL TAKE OUT A LOAN. WE'LL SEND HER TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE SHOULD SEND HER BACK TO OLDENFIELD. [scoffs] WITH PHILIP LAWVER THERE? HASN'T HE DONE ENOUGH? DOES HE ALSO GET TO FORCE HER OUT OF OLDENFIELD HIGH? I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE. I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID. I'VE MADE A DECISION. I WON'T GO BACK. HONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE THAT YET. YES, I DO. I WANT TO GO LIVE WITH AUNT MEG, IN CONNECTICUT. THAT'S MY DECISION. OK, OK, LET US TALK ABOUT IT. [sighs] NO WAY. [doorbell ringing] MISS MALEVICH. SO YOU LIVE. THE RUMORS CONFLICT ON THAT POINT, SO MALEVICH MUST SEE FOR HERSELF. UH, MOM, DAD, YES. THIS IS MISS MALEVICH. THIS IS MY MOTHER AND FATHER. HELLO, MISS MALEVICH. HOW DO YOU DO? PLEASURE, SIR. WON'T YOU COME IN? PLEASE, I MUST ASK YOU TO EXCUSE THIS INTRUSION TO YOUR HOME, BUT YOU SEE, THE SCHOOL IS LIKE A SMALL VILLAGE INSIDE A SMALL VILLAGE, AND RUMORS ABOUND IN SUCH PLACES. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? NONSENSE. THEY INVENT DRAMAS. THEY SAY YOU WERE PUT UPON BY A GANG OF DOPE FIENDS AND BEATEN. MACHINES ARE SAID TO KEEP HER ALIVE. OH, YOU WILL HAVE AN AURA OF GREAT MYSTERY WHEN YOU RETURN TO SCHOOL. I'M NOT GOING BACK. OH? I SEE. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, MISS MALEVICH? NO. NO, THANK YOU. MOM, DAD, CAN I TALK TO MISS MALEVICH BY MYSELF? SURE. EXCUSE US. I WAS RAPED. THERE IS ALWAYS THAT NUGGET OF TRUTH IN ALL TALK. OH, I--I AM SO SORRY. WHO DID THIS THING TO YOU? PHILIP LAWVER. LAWVER. I KNEW THE LAWVERS LONG BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. THEY ALWAYS LIVED TOO MUCH LIKE THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE ON EARTH. I AM NOT SO ASTONISHED THAT IN TIME THEY SHOULD PRODUCE A SON WHO CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD WITH OTHERS. OH, BUT HE WILL. HE PROBABLY WON'T EVEN BE PUNISHED FOR THIS. YOU LOOK FOR JUSTICE, AND YOU PUNISH YOURSELF? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR LIFE HERE, IT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO YOU? THEN YOU MUST FIGHT FOR IT. CRIMINALS WALK THE STREETS AND YOU HIDE YOURSELF INSIDE. THEN YOU ARE THE PRISONER. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW. YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT RUN FROM THIS THING. WELL, I GOTTA DO IT SOMETIME, MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW. I'M PROUD OF YOU. [people chattering] HYPERBOLE, ALLITERATION, ONOMATOPOEIA. I WANT YOU TO WRITE THESE TERMS DOWN IN YOUR NOTEBOOK, CLASS, STUDY THEM VERY CAREFULLY. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, THEY WILL BE USED IN YOUR FINAL EXAMINATION. NOW IF YOU HAVE PAID ATTENTION DURING CLASS, YOU SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE AT ALL. BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT, I WOULD BE VERY WILLING TO STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND HELP. BUT YOU MUST STUDY THESE WORDS, THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT. OK, THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE TO INCREASE YOUR EXPOSURE WHEN YOU HAVE A FILTER OVER A LENS, IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A FILTER FACTOR. (Mr. Elden) IF YOU STUDY THESE PHOTOS YOU GOT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL WHO'S DONE IT RIGHT AND WHO HASN'T. SOME WILL LOOK JUST HORRIBLY GROTESQUE. THE REST OF THEM-- (Mr. Elden) AND WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT, IT'S A DEFINITE ADDITION. NOW, READ THIS ARTICLE. YOU CAN GO TO SLEEP IF YOU WANT TO. BUT THIS... THE FILTER FACTOR IS SIMPLY THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE EXPOSURE MUST BE INCREASED TO REPRODUCE A GRAY OBJECT PROPERLY WHEN USING A GIVEN FILTER. FILTER FACTOR OF 2 MEANS THE EXPOSURE MUST BE DOUBLED. FACTOR OF 4 MEANS THE EXPOSURE MUST BE INCREASED 4 TIMES. ALISON! ARE YOU PLANNING ON JUST NEVER SPEAKING TO ME AGAIN? DON'T BE SILLY. I'M NOT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. I GUESS YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP IT. WHAT ISN'T MY FAULT? NEVER MIND, LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT IT. NO! (Gail) FORGET WHAT? WHAT DID HE TELL YOU? (Alison) LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, OK? NO, NOT OK. I WAS HOME THE WHOLE WEEK. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME? STEVE SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ON THE PHONE. THAT'S A LAME EXCUSE, YOU NEVER EVEN TRIED. YES, I DID. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU JUST WANT TO PRETEND THAT THE WHOLE THING NEVER EVEN HAPPENED. PHIL SENT ME THOSE NOTES. AND PHIL RAPED ME, AND YOU KNOW IT. PHIL WAS RIGHT. YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND! HE'S GOT "TRAMPS AND ANGELS." YOU'RE THE ANGEL AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS A TRAMP! PHIL SAID YOU THREW YOURSELF AT HIM. WELL, NOW I KNOW IT'S TRUE! PHILIP LAWVER RAPED ME. ALISON, WHY WOULD I MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT UP? BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY! YOU'RE JEALOUS AND YOU'RE CRAZY. PHIL TOLD ME. YOU JUST WANT PHIL, DON'T YOU? YOU'RE JEALOUS OF US, THAT'S WHAT IT IS! AND YOU WON'T GIVE UP YOUR WEDDING-CAKE FANTASY, WILL YOU? [sobbing] (Steve) YOU DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT ALISON TO BELIEVE YOU, DID YOU? (Gail) I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND. HE'S SICK. IT'S ALL WRONG. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. [sighing] I HAVE TO. THE PRELIMINARY HEARING'S NEXT WEEK. THE JUDGE COULD THROW IT OUT OF COURT, OR PHIL COULD EVEN GET OFF BY PLEA BARGAINING. IT'S HOPELESS. THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE. GAIL, UH, IF YOU REALLY FEEL THAT WAY, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO COURT. MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME TO GET OVER IT. NO, I HAVE TO GO. IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET OVER IT. I-IT'S LIKE THE NOTE HE SENT ME. THE FIRST NOTE. NOW HE'S AFTER SONIA. THIS IS EVIDENCE, ISN'T IT? I DON'T KNOW. I--I JUST DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. I'VE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO PROVE IT WAS PHIL. HOW? [scratching] HOW MUCH LONGER? I'M JUST ABOUT FINISHED. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? HERE. TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY. YOU SEE, THE SHUTTER WILL CLICK EVERY COUPLE OF SECONDS. MMM-HMM. AND THAT WAY, IF PHILIP LAWVER TRIES TO PUT ANOTHER NOTE IN SONIA'S LOCKER, I'LL GET IT ON FILM. [camera clicking] "HE DID NOT WEAR HIS SCARLET COAT "FOR BLOOD AND WINE ARE RED "AND BLOOD AND WINE WERE ON HIS HANDS "WHEN THEY FOUND HIM WITH THE DEAD "THE POOR DEAD WOMEN HE LOVE "AND MURDERED IN HIS BED "HE WALKED AMONGST THE TRIAL MEN IN A SHABBY SUIT OF GRAY" [camera clicking] [camera clicking] CAN YOU COME WITH ME TO THE LAB TONIGHT? TONIGHT? YEAH. I WANNA DEVELOP THAT FILM. I UNDERSTAND ABOUT ALL THIS. I REALLY DO. BUT LATELY, THE ONLY TIME I'M ALONE WITH YOU IS IN HERE. I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME. NO. REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT JUST GETTING OVER IT? MMM-HMM. I'M JUST GIVING MYSELF TIME. OK? OK. [camera clicking] WHY WON'T YOU SAY ANYTHING TO ME? PHIL! I SAW YOU THAT NIGHT. YOU WERE ON MY PORCH. YOU LOOKED CRAZY. [shushing] YOU SAID THAT--THAT GAIL THREW HERSELF AT YOU. THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME. BUT THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. SAY SOMETHING. PLEASE, JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T HAVE TO ACCOUNT TO YOU FOR ANYTHING I DO. I DON'T HAVE TO ACCOUNT TO ANYONE FOR ANYTHING I DO. [camera clicking] [screams] [Gail screaming] (Gail)&nbsp; WE NEVER DID GET TO COURT. PHILIP LAWVER&nbsp; PLEADED GUILTY TO ASSAULT, SO THEY THREW OUT&nbsp; THE RAPE CHARGE. BUT EVEN THOUGH I LOST, IT WAS WORTH IT&nbsp; TO GET IT ALL OUT IN THE OPEN. PHIL LEFT SCHOOL&nbsp; AFTER THANKSGIVING. SOMEONE SAID HE WENT CRAZY&nbsp; AND THEY PUT HIM AWAY. BUT STEVE AND I DON'T THINK&nbsp; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. SOMEBODY ELSE SAID HIS FOLKS&nbsp; SENT HIM TO A BOARDING SCHOOL&nbsp; IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE HE IS. AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER, I ASKED JESSICA,&nbsp; "HOW COME THE LAW&nbsp; PROTECTS THE RAPIST AND NOT THE VICTIM?" AND SHE SAID,&nbsp; "BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS WRONG."
