23.976 English from SDH sync ? 30.11.2019 Good morning, Washington! Only four days until Christmas, and it's a cold one out there! But to warm us up, here are the soothing sounds of Mr. Michael Bubl?! ? Sleigh bells ring ? ? Are you listenin'? ? ? In the lane ? ? Snow is glistenin' ? ? A beautiful sight ? ? We're happy tonight ? ? Walkin' in a winter wonderland ? ? Gone away is the blue bird ? ? Here to stay is a new bird ? ? To sing a love song ? ? While we stroll along ? ? Walkin' in a winter wonderland ? ? In the meadow we can build a snowman... ? -Tom. -Hey, Helen. Can you take us with you? With a family like yours, I would never want to go anywhere. These go under the tree. Oh, you shouldn't have. And here's this guy. Mm-hmm. Well, we'll take good care of her for you. You always do. Thanks, Helen. I loved that article on sofas you did in the Ladies' Weekly. Oh, you're too kind. Merry Christmas, Helen. Thank you. You too, Tom. Do you really need all that stuff? You know I'm an over-packer. I know you're an over-spender. Uh, Mr. Powers? You're Max Powers, the movie director, right? Guilty as charged. Wow. I've seen every one of your films. -Can I get a selfie? -Sure. -Are you anyone? -No. Thanks! I still cannot believe you talked me into flying all the way from L.A. Just to ride the train back home with you. How else are you going to write a script about a train? Look, I really appreciate the opportunity, but I think you should probably find somebody else. I mean, I'm a script doctor. I help fix other people's movies. I don't think I'm ready to write one myself. Eleanor... You know you're the daughter that I never had. You have four kids. All boys, and since you're like a daughter to me, I can tell you, you have confidence issues. Max... You're too good to be re-writing other people's stories. It's time you put your name on something, and what a better way to start than romance on a train? Okay... I feel something magical happening for you this Christmas Eve. That's our wedding day! Is it? -How did you know? -Oh, my goodness! Looks like we'll be leaving right on time. -That's good. -Yes, certainly is. People rely on us, you know. You work for the trains? Did, for most of my life. I'm just a passenger now. You ride often? Well, it's been a while... 10 years. -Oh, that is a while. -Yeah. Actually, I thought I'd never get on one again. -Ah. Too many stops? -Too many stops, you might say. Tom Langdon. Herrick Higgins. My friends call me Higgins. Higgins it is. -Excuse me. -Yeah. Higgins. Hi, Leila. I was just about to call you. Please tell me you're not canceling. No, no, I'll be there. Christmas day, just like we planned. In fact, I'm leaving now... On a train. What? I'm taking the train. All the way to Los Angeles? You can't be serious. It's for a story. So you need to be on a train to write a story? Yes, it's a story about Christmas on a train. -I'll be there. I promise. -I hope so. Relationship problems? Excuse me? I'm sorry, I just-- I couldn't help but overhear. Was that your wife? No. Girlfriend, then. How much did you actually overhear? Oh, you know, just... Like, a tad. A tad? Everything. Everything. But don't worry. It'll all come out on the train. It always does. All aboard! There's a guy down there writing a story. -About the Christmas train! -Oh! Yes. Oh, yes, sorry. Welcome aboard. What's that, A Christmas Carol? Yes. I haven't read that one in a long time. It's my wife's. I promised her that I'd re-read the classics. A lofty goal. Afraid I haven't started yet. Welcome aboard, Mr. Kelly. Welcome aboard, Mr... Langdon. Thank you, and it's Tom. Tom. I hear you're writing a story about the Christmas train. Word travels fast around here. You have no idea. You're in compartment D. Great. You're right next to me. Good. Great. Don't worry, you'll get to know Agnes, whether you want to or not. Merry Christmas. Hey. Don't tell me you already started writing. Well, if you consider staring at a blank page writing, then yes. I hope you're not planning to do this whole thing from your room. The inspiration is out there, not in here. Max, we haven't even left the station yet. Exactly, so live a little. Take it in. Is this how it's going to be the whole way? I've been making movies for a long time, and you know the one word that starts everything off? "Action"? No. "Hello." I'll be in the lounge car, cavorting with my fellow passengers. Okay. Have fun. "And so it begins, "a 3,000-mile trek across America "in four days. I hope there's a story here." Do I have to pay a toll to pass through? Sorry. Oh, don't be. It's nice to see two young people who can't live without each other. And we won't, will we? We're getting married on the train. Congratulations! Is the whole wedding party on board? No, just us. Well, that's all you need, right? I'm Steve, and that's Julie. Tom, and this is Agnes. Congratulations! Yeah, excuse me. Pardon me. -Hello. -Hello. Hi. Yep... Agnes. And remember, Tuesday is your lucky day. What's my lucky day? Have a seat and I'll tell you. You're a psychic? I know things. You could call it intuition. I'm kind of more of a fact guy. Hmm. That might change along the way. What are you drinking? What do you got? Uh, we got Santa-tini, the Red Rudolph, the Grinch... What's in the Grinch? Drink one and you'll think every day is Christmas. I'll have a Grinch. Make that two. Hey, is that the original P42 cap engine? 16 cylinders, 4,250 horsepower? Right you are. What that thing couldn't outrun, it would run right over. You're a train man, huh? Ah, well, my dad had a thing for the trains. Mine too. He put me on one when I was 16 and told me, "Don't come back until you make something of yourself." Max Powers. The director? Guilty as charged. I'm a big fan. Tom Langdon. -Tom, where are you heading? -L.A. I'm guessing you're not in any big hurry to get there? Why do you say that? You are taking a train. Right. Well, I'm actually on board looking for a story. You're a writer? Um, a journalist, or at least I was. I was a war correspondent, way back when. Now the most dangerous thing I cover is the hazardous pitfalls of home barbecuing. Who's this one for? This one's for my dad... His last wish. Mm. Mark Twain is a distant relative, and apparently, he wanted to write a story about train travel and never did, so hopefully I can. There's something about a train, right? There is. My next movie's going to take place on one. Oh, wow. You know, I just had a brainstorm. You and my writer should team up, I mean, just for the research part.. swap notes, stories you've heard, and the pulse of America on a train. Well, thank you for the offer, but, uh... I'm more accustomed to working alone. Of course, I'll pay you. No, no, it's not that. I did have a partner once, and, well, it just didn't work out that well. Yeah, I understand. I had a few partners myself, but at least join us for dinner tonight. How could I say no to Max Powers? Trust me. You can't. All right, Max. Good to meet you. "I just want to be your friend." Hold on, I need to take this. Hello, Tom. Hey. Listen, I feel bad about our conversation before. I didn't think my mode of transportation would upset you. Well, it did. I mean, you have four days to spend with your covered wagon, but no time for me? We really need to discuss this relationship. I was thinking the same thing. I am so happy you feel the same way. Yeah, I was hoping we could talk about it when I get there? Great. Okay, great, I'll see you soon. But not too soon, I guess. Merry Christmas. Hey, Tom! Have a seat. Thank you, Max. My writer is running a bit behind. A few hours on the train, she's already got writer's block. Merry Christmas, gentlemen. Thank you, Roxanne. Let me see... For you. Oh, I needed a pen. Mine's gone AWOL. Yeah. Oh, here she is. This is my writer, Eleanor Carter. You two know each other? Uh... -Yeah. -A little. No. Not really. It was a lifetime ago. And yet not long enough. Ellie... No one calls me that anymore. -Um... -Take a seat. -Do I have to? -I'll go. Uh-uh, nobody's going anywhere. Whatever went on between you two in this "other lifetime," that can be settled here. Besides, it's almost Christmas. I see you still have that old notebook. I see you've given yours up. Nobody uses paper anymore. Ah, it always worked for me. iPads, paper... Whatever gets the story out, right? Funny, I never would have pictured you in Hollywood. And I never pictured the man who was going to change the world writing about "his and her closets". Oh, so you read it. In the waiting room of my dentist's, yeah. You know, the interesting thing about "his and her closets" is the "her" doesn't get up and run off without explanation. And the "his" always stays shut and empty. You know, I'm going to get off at the next stop. There you go, running off again. I've never seen her like that. I'm afraid I... I bring out the worst in her. I should go after her... Unless you want to. No, I'm afraid it's a little late for that. -Can I come in? -Sure, Max. -You okay? -Yeah. Just kind of caught me off guard, you know? Hmm. He's the one you told me about? The one that broke your heart. I'm sorry. I had no idea. Max... How could you? Anyway, it's ancient history. How long were you together? -Six years. -That's a long time. Yeah. We met on assignment, traveled the globe together, from one war-torn country to the next, trying to change the world. Hmm. Anyway, that kind of thing takes its toll, you know? Being in love? I just couldn't live like that anymore. Apparently, he could. Hmm... But he's not now. That doesn't matter. I left all that behind when I came to work for you. So working for me was an escape from your feelings. Hollywood isn't real. Movies have happy endings. -Well, maybe this is fate. -No, it's not. This is bad luck, that's all. Tom Langdon was the biggest mistake of my life. You, uh, see anything out there? Just a dark night. My wife used to say, "There never was a problem that could defeat sunrise or Christmas." I'll remember that. -Is she traveling with you? -No. She passed a few months back. I'm so sorry. We would have been married 40 years. A lifetime. Mm. I'm guessing that you're having a pretty rough night, too. The dining car tables are pretty close. I saw someone on the train tonight I never thought I'd see again. Ellie. "Eleanor". And she hates me. -She did seem a little upset. -Yeah. We didn't have the years together you had, but we were happy. I thought we were. What happened? We were in Jerusalem, covering a story, and out of the blue, she says she wants to go home. She asked me to go with her. She wouldn't explain. I was stubborn. I watched her get on a train and disappear from my life. Tom Langdon. John Kelly. Chugging down the tracks in 2,000 tons of pure steel... Trapped in a tin can... I always hoped I'd see her again. With the one person I never wanted to see. Why do I suddenly feel like a war correspondent again? I need to get off this train. Train number 17 to Newark now leaving Bay 2. A winter storm is pushing into the Rockies. I think you should take on an extra engine in La Junta. -I'll pass that along. -Thanks, Higgins. That Higgins... Once a railroad man, always a railroad man. He probably should still be one. As far as I'm concerned, he knows more about trains than anyone I have ever met. -Why did he quit? -Oh, he didn't quit. They let him go. Hey! Norman! How's your mom doing? How does she know everyone? Oh, she's been riding the train just about as long as I have, and I've had a courtship with this one for 20 years. Roxanne? I seem to have lost a charm bracelet. Has anyone turned one in? Well, no, not yet, Miss Larson, but I'll keep a lookout. Thank you. No problem. Have other passengers reported things missing? You too? Well, it's just an old pen. I can't imagine anyone would take it. It's not worth anything, except to me. -Well, I'll keep a lookout. -Thanks. We leave in an hour. -Don't make me have to come find you. -Okay. Everything okay? It's terrible. It's just a little snag. Our minister was supposed to board here, and now he's not. He slipped on the ice and he broke his arm. It's a sign. It sounds like winter in the Midwest. This was supposed to be the happiest time of our lives. It still can be. Not if your parents have their way. Your parents don't approve? Steve's father doesn't think I'm good enough. They're high-society Washington, and I'm just some girl from small-town Kentucky. I work at his firm. He said it would be a bad career move if I didn't stop seeing her. Well, 20 years from now, you'll be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than the things you did. -Is that from personal experience? -No. That's from Mark Twain. You know, my grandmother did marry my granddad in a train station. See, everything is going to be just fine. -Did you, uh, get your flight out? -I'm working on it. -I heard somewhere you got married. -And divorced. -Oh. Sorry. -It's okay. And I take it you never got married? No, I'm seeing someone off and on, in L.A. Mm-hmm? I guess since the chances of us ever seeing each other again are pretty slim, can you tell me now? Tell you what? We were so happy. You just... Walked out on me. -Is that how you remember it? -That's how it was. I knew this was going to happen as soon as I saw you. I.. I knew.. No, Ellie, I'm not trying to.. It's Eleanor. Forgive me for living in the past when you were just Ellie. We didn't even fight. You just left. It's not like I suddenly changed. No, Tom, you didn't. You never changed. I guess I did. ? Deck the halls with boughs of holly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ? ? 'Tis the season to be jolly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la... ? -You're up late. -Yeah. You too, Agnes. Oh, I.. I never sleep. I wouldn't want to miss out on anything. And I'm sure you haven't. I'm sorry how things went with Eleanor, in the dining car. No secrets on a train, especially the Christmas train. Yeah, I'm starting to get that. I've seen enough to know that two people who can make each other that miserable must have really been in love. So are you spending some time with family for the holidays, somewhere along the line? Not necessarily. -So... You're just riding the train? -Is that a problem? Uh, no. No. Just making conversation. You have a tree. Wouldn't be Christmas without one. -Good night, Agnes. -Good night. Thanks. ? Christmas is only a week and a few days away ? ? And you haven't seen your folks ? ? Since Thanksgiving Day ? ? I'll say it loud and clear ? ? I'll say it plain ? ? You won't want to miss this year... ? Good morning, Tom! Great news. Eleanor changed her mind. She's decided to stay on and carve out the story with you. Actually, all the flights are booked. Everything's booked solid for Christmas. Well, I like to see it another way. Max Powers always gets what he wants. That's right. Please. So you can co-exist on this train for a few days. Although it does get a little smaller the longer you're on it. -Life is full of funny coincidences. -Yeah. I went to lunch in an expensive cafe in Beverly Hills a few months ago, and who's there? Not one, not two, but all three of my ex-wives. Apparently, they meet every Tuesday to talk about how awful it was to be married to me. Yeah, sort of like a book club. So, tell me, what have you learned on the train so far? Well... Ah. That's Agnes. She seems to know everybody and have no destination. She's either very nosy, or there's something else going on. Mm. And, uh... That's Mr. John Kelly. He's lost his wife and, I suppose, himself. Misty, who offers up random information and calls it intuition. Oh, and we have a love story on board, yeah. Steve and Julie. They're eloping. He's big-city society, she's small-town Kentucky, parents don't approve, and they've lost their minister and they have no one to marry them. All of that in one day? Has it only been one day? Oh, and... We might have a thief on board. I can't find my sunglasses. Because you leave them everywhere. Or because someone took them. Or you're creating a story when there isn't one. I guess we'll see. -Good morning, Tom. -Oh, hey, Julie, Steve. Morning. -Hey. This is Eleanor Carter... -Hi. And Mr. Max Powers. Max Powers, we heard you were on board. -We've seen all your movies. -I hope you see my next one. -Eleanor's writing it. -Oh, how exciting. You know, it so happens that I'm not just a director. I'm also licensed to perform weddings. Since when? You don't know everything about me. If you're still looking for someone to officiate, I'd be honored. -And what if I throw the wedding? -Food, flowers, music... It could be a Max Powers production. Mr. Powers, we don't know what to say. We'd say yes. And thank you! This is wonderful. My parents got married on a train. I thought you said grandparents. Oh. Yeah. That's what I meant. I'm just so excited, I can barely talk. Oh, I hope you remember how to say "I do". So you're from Kentucky? I don't hear an accent. Ah, well, we moved around a lot when I was a kid. Anyway, I feel like the luckiest girl in world. You and Steve make a wonderful couple. Thank you. Yeah. I just wish Steve's parents felt that way too. You know, Tom and I went through something similar. City boy, country girl. We couldn't have been more different, but none of that mattered, and it shouldn't for you guys. And you're still together. Oh, no, we're not, but we were for very a long time. My point is, if you want to make it work, you can. Come on, you two. Let's talk about this wedding... On Christmas Eve day, we're going to be in a little place called La Junta... You believe all that? I did when I was her age. I kind of still remember it differently, and for the record, I want you to know, I always liked that you were a country girl. Tom, why are you on this train, really? What do you mean? You were always the guy who wanted to get there as fast as possible. I probably wouldn't be, except I made a promise to my dad. -Oh. -How is your dad? -He died a while back. -Oh, no. I'm sorry. That's all right. Thanks. He always really liked you. I liked him, too. Hey, is your mom okay? How's she doing? Oh, healthy as a horse, and still criticizing my every move. She never really liked me, huh? No, but she doesn't like anybody, so... Right. Your move. If you have one. Who's he? Really full of himself. He says he's a grand chess master. Likes to ride the rails and play and stay sharp, but if you ask me, he just likes embarrassing people. Excuse me. -Checkmate. -What was that, eight moves? -What does it matter? -It was eight. And in your script? The chess master gets annihilated in the first act. Who's next? State champion four years running. Good for you. So who'd you end up marrying? Oh, well, he was pretty much the polar opposite of you. Oh, I'll try not to take that personally. It didn't last long. And what about your long-distance thing? Probably better if it stays long distance. We see each other just a couple of times a year, and that seems to be enough. Hmm. Checkmate again! Isn't there anybody out there who can give me a good game? Yeah, she will. What? No, no, no, I haven't played in years. I can't.. I don't want to.. I'm pretty sure you'll remember. Uh, you do realize this isn't checkers. Oh. Lucky for me, I'm not any good at checkers. Ladies first. Oh. Thank you. Let's see... Did you just throw her into the lion's den? Nope. She learned the game from a rabbi in Tel Aviv. One strategy. She can tell in three moves whether her opponent has bitten. It usually works best on the best players, because they're overconfident. Mm. Check. And that would be checkmate. Merry Christmas. Spoil sport. -Yeah! -Yeah! That was awesome. Thank you. You really nailed that guy! Did you see his face? Oh.. You see anything out there? Just keeping an eye on the weather. Old habit. Tom! Misty tells me my next movie's going to be a hit. Well, aren't they all? It's a lovely watch. Souvenir from one of your movies? How do you do this, Misty? May I? "To Max from your devoted cast". Well, I've got a wedding to plan. Give it a shot. You have nothing to lose. Okay. Can I borrow that a moment? Sure. This book has been a lot of places. Hence the cracked leather cover. Last time you were on a train, you lost the love of your life. Good guess. There's something else. A surprise is coming your way. I like surprises. I'm not sure you'll like this one. Well, okay. Thanks. -What are you drinking, Tom? -I'll have what he's having. Hot chocolate coming up. One candy cane or two? You'd better make it two. -Any progress? -No. Still on page one. How are things with you and Eleanor? Still on page one. Here you go. I added some whipped cream on the house. The holidays and all... -What happened to your model train? -Oh... Good question. It wasn't here when I came in this morning. I asked maintenance, but they haven't seen it either. -A toast, then. -All right. Here's to finding things that we've lost. To finding things we've lost. Oh, hi, Roxanne. Tonight's menu. Oh. Thank you. -How's the story going? -Mm, actually, I'm a little stuck. -Do you mind? -Uh, no. Come in. One of the little benefits of train travel that you don't get on a plane... Come here. Oh, wow. -That feels amazing. -Yeah. I just love looking out at this land without a piece of glass or anything else in the way. -How'd you come to work on a train? -It's pretty much in my blood. Most everyone I grew up with works on the train, but this one is special. There's something about this Christmas train, I don't know if it's the magic of the season or what, but it has a way of turning strangers into family. I would have thought all trains were the same. No, no, no, no, no. This one is special. It brought you and Tom back together again, after all. That's right, honey, everyone knows. Ancient history. Well, you know what they say about history... It has a way of repeating itself. They also say never make the same mistake twice. Well, they also say Christmas comes once a year, but true love may only come once in a lifetime. -Who says that? -Me. I'm just not sure I need love to be happy, Roxanne. Well... Don't be so sure that you don't need it, either. Tom? You trying to slip by me? I didn't see you there, Agnes. Oh. Well, there's a lot of things you're not seeing. -What do you mean? -Think of a chess game. You can either make your first move, or you can wait and wait and wait until your queen is gone and you're off the table. -You're quite the philosopher. -Well, thank you. I.. I try. ? Silent night ? ? Holy night ? ? All is calm ? ? All is bright ? ? Round yon virgin ? ? Mother and child ? ? Holy infant ? ? So tender and mild... ? These boys will be joining us for the rest of our trip. ? Sleep in heavenly peace ? ? Sleep in heavenly peace ? Whoo! That's just what Christmas music is supposed to sound like. They're performing in our sister church's holiday show. You know, I just might be in attendance at that. Well, you would not regret it. -How long is the layover? -Two hours and 12 minutes. -Don't be late. -All right, who's hungry? -Yes! -Yeah. Okay, well, let's go get some food. So about your thief on board, it turns out you might be right. "My" thief? I'm missing some earrings. I'm sorry to hear that. Are you? I do like you saying I'm right. I said you "might" be right. Expensive earrings? Actually, they were from you. It was our first Christmas together. I'm surprised you kept them. I keep a lot of things. Julie. What's the matter? Steve's parents called. They found out we were eloping and they threatened to disown him if he married me, and he didn't say anything! He didn't stand up for me. Where is he? I'm not even sure he's coming back. You get in one of those cabs, there's no coming back. Maybe it's the best for both of us. -Do you love her? -Yes. It's just, it's... It's not that simple. Well, it is, actually. She may be the only woman in the entire world who you'll love and will make you happy. You don't know that now. You think that when it gets tough, you'll just find somebody else, but maybe you won't. If you blow this, you might live the rest of your life regretting it. Where to, mister? Thanks. We won't be needing you tonight, buddy. -Okay. Happy holidays. -Same to you. That was a nice thing you did. Well, why stand by and let someone else mess up his life? -It's ironic... -Yeah. The two of us giving them advice. Or to anyone. Yeah. Hey, guys. We want to ask you something. Eleanor, would you be my maid of honor? Oh... And will you be my best man? Wow... If it wasn't for what you said, we might not even have a wedding. Well, I think you're giving me a little too much credit. -So is that a yes? -Yes, of course. Yeah. We'd be honored. Come on. Well, you must be pretty nervous, being in a wedding. Oh, no, I'm okay with other people's weddings. Oh. Come on. I want to buy something. Chestnuts roasting on an open fire? That too. Come with me. ? O Christmas tree O Christmas tree... ? Where are we going? Oh. Okay. Oh, hey. Oh, yeah. -For you. -Thank you. And this one is for Agnes. She has a little tree. You're starting to like this Agnes. I find Agnes to be one of the most irritating people I've ever met, and yeah, I like her. Here you go. All right, we have an hour and 47 minutes. Should we go back and write? -Come on. -What? Where? What are you doing? ? It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... ? -And this is advancing my script how? -Maybe your main character's a dancer. Oh, okay, and why is she taking the train? Got to get home for Christmas. She meets someone, a stranger in the lounge car... Okay... Oh, how about the bartender, dressed as Santa, who, beneath the fake beard, turns out he's her long-lost dance partner. And she never got over him. -Oh, she got over him. -Yeah? Yeah. Hmm. Well, she never danced the same again. Well, she just... Moved on to other things. Can I ask you something? Mm-hmm. You were a great journalist. -Why did you abandon it? -Turns out I prefer fiction. -Over real life? -Yeah. Isn't that why you started writing fluff pieces? I don't know. Maybe because I lost my sense of adventure. I doubt that. Or I used it all up with you. When you left, everything was different. I guess I realized I couldn't change the world after all at least, not alone. I don't know if we could have changed it together. It sure felt like we could. Oh. Thanks. When I first started this trip, it was for my dad, but now it feels like more. What if it's not coincidence that we're both here? -What else could it be? -I don't know. Do you believe in second chances? Excuse me. Hello. May I have your names, please? Cheers. Merry Christmas. ? It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... ? -Made it! -Made it with two minutes to spare. -Two minutes? -Yeah. What are we going to do with two minutes? Um... I don't know. Um... Mistletoe. I'm pretty sure that's holly. Maybe you don't know this, but the tradition of kissing under the mistletoe first started in a small Bavarian town... Oh, yeah? And the original plant was holly. Are you making this up? Well, over the decades, holly was gradually replaced by mistletoe because mistletoe, like love, blossoms even in the coldest winters. -You're totally making this up. -I'm totally making this up. -What's wrong? -Oh, uh, my timing is so bad. Surprise! Lelia... I'm riding this covered wagon with you all the way to California! Uh... Hi. Can you believe it's my first time on a train? Isn't this charming? Well, we'll just have to make the best of it. Yeah... That's all I get, after traveling all this way? I couldn't even get a direct flight. I had to fly through Denver. Sorry. I'm just... I'm surprised to see you, especially after our last few phone calls. That's why I'm here. I wanted to talk in person. I didn't want to wait until Christmas. Oh. I really appreciate that you came all this way. I was going to say all this when I got there. I just want you to know, despite any of our conflicts or disappointments, I-- No, no. This long-distance thing has run its course. I couldn't agree more. I want to get married. -To who? -To you, silly. I've thought of everything. You'll move to L.A., because you can work anywhere, and... I know marriage is a lifetime, every day, good times, bad times, sickness, health, et cetera, and I am ready for all of that. I'm tired of being casual. I want the whole package. I can see that this is a lot to throw at you. Don't answer me now. Take your time and think about it. We have two days to L.A., right? I think I'm going to go to the bar. When will you be back? Two days? Well, I guess I dodged a bullet. Something you're good at. I'm just saying, you're waving that white flag awfully fast. Why am I even seeking advice from someone who's been married three times? -Four. -What? My one big love was my first wife, Patti. Married out of high school, dirt poor, couldn't be happier. I was just starting to make it when she passed away. I loved her more than I ever loved anyone or anything. I'll always love her. My three ex-wives? In a way, I loved them, I guess, but not like Patti. If she had lived, I would have never looked at another woman. You never told me. Well, one of the few things I keep to myself. I'm telling you now because I understand the urge to close yourself off when your heart is broken. I'm pretty sure that Tom was your one great love, and from what I can tell, you were his. Are you really going to let it slip away this time? Happy endings are for movies, Max. Life can be like a movie sometimes, and you are a really good writer. I only seem to know how to fix other people's stories. Well, then, maybe it's time you re-write your own. You look worried. A storm in the Rockies. -You think it's trouble? -I don't know. I'm probably inventing problems just so I can feel useful again. Who knows, in 10 years, trains could be a thing of the past. And what will we do then? We'll tell people how wonderful they were to ride. Tom, there you are. You won't believe what's happened. Our wedding bands are missing. I think someone took them when we got off in Chicago. If this isn't a sign, I don't know what is. This might be more of a thief than a sign. I will tie a string around your finger if I have to. Agnes? Agnes? -Hey. -Hey. Look who we found.. our maid of honor. -Hi. -Hi. A Christmas present. Tom... They were given to me many Christmases ago, in Kenya. They're good luck. They're beautiful. Well, they go wherever I go, and they've brought me here. We can't accept these. Well, they belong on someone's hand, not in a duffel bag. Thank you, Tom. We won't forget this. -Thank you. -Of course. Wow. Can you believe this? I can't believe you kept those rings. I suppose I have a hard time giving some things up. Not that hard. -Please, let me try to explain.. -You don't need to. I wasn't expecting her. It was a total surprise. I was going to L.A. To break it off. I know she felt the same way. Well, apparently, you were wrong. No, I.. I'm not. There's something off about this. Just... It doesn't make any sense. She would never fly to the middle of nowhere. I mean, not for me, anyway. Tom, we both know that love makes people do strange things. It's not love. Ho, ho, ho! ? Jingle bells, jingle bells ? ? Jingle all the way ? ? Oh, what fun, it is to ride ? ? In a one-horse open sleigh ? Everybody! ? Jingle bells, jingle bells ? ? Jingle all the way ? ? Oh, what fun, it is to ride ? ? In a one-horse open sleigh ? ? Jingle bells, jingle bells ? ? Jingle all the way ? ? Oh, what fun, it is to ride... ? Lelia? Come in! -Oh, wow, you look great. -Gorgeous, right? This dress is one-of-a-kind. You're not going to believe who I ran into in the club car. Oh, before we get into all of that, uh, can we talk? Max Powers! Did I ever tell you that I auditioned for him once? I really thought he was going to hire me, and if he had, my career would be on a whole different trajectory. I thought you liked your career. Of course I don't. I'm a cartoon rodent. Here's the best part.. He's invited us to dinner. This could be a huge break for me. -Uh, Lelia, I.. I.. -No, we can talk later. -Come on, we're going to be late. -Uh, okay... I do voice-over work now. Actually, I'm the voice of Cuppy the Beaver. I would love to get back on the big screen. Tom says that you're working on a new script. Eleanor is. -Tom's been quite helpful. -Not that helpful. I agree. I read for you once. It was for Bells of Christmas. I always wondered why I didn't get the part. Obviously, one of my biggest mistakes. Well, now you have a chance to correct it. I'm all for second chances. This appears to be quite a fortuitous trip. Did you know Tom and Eleanor used to know each other? No! Well, it was a long time ago. -We worked together. -Yeah. Yeah, war correspondents. What a coincidence. Yeah. I forgot you did all that. Understandable. You're too modest, Tom. You did win a Manchester Award for journalism. They don't give those away to anybody. Actually, he won two. I never knew that. Yeah. You must miss it. Ah, sometimes, but now I get to investigate the pros and cons of memory-foam pillows. Well, it was so nice of you to come out here and join Tom. Well, I had a question to ask him that just couldn't wait. -Oh. What's that? -To marry me. So... are, uh... congratulations in order? Uh... No, we haven't, um, really... He's still mustering up the courage to say yes. Well, I'm sure he'll make the right decision. So, um, what's this script about? And, more importantly, is there a part in it for me? I'm leaning toward a Christmas love story, but I'm not sure Eleanor's on the same page. I'm happy to audition on the train. We're all stuck here together, right? It's a Wonderful Life, one of my favorites. Tom! They're showing It's a Wonderful Life. -Come with us. -Oh, uh, no, thanks. That one makes me cry. It's good to cry every once in a while. You two go. I'm going to write. Oh, we don't want to get in the way of inspiration. I'm going to turn in. Good night. -It's early. -It feels late. Listen, I know how awful this seems.. you know what, tomorrow's Christmas Eve and we have a wedding, someone else's wedding, so... Let's just go and perform our duties and then say goodbye for good. -So you're finally reading that book? -Uh-huh. Yeah. I figured it was about time for me to turn a page or two. Maybe you should do the same. Thanks for the advice. I'm only saying that you and Eleanor obviously belong together. Don't let something from the past keep you apart. Thanks, John. Thank you so much for working on Christmas Eve. I'll be sure to use you on all my train station weddings. You're watching the sky a lot. Can't see much through those storm clouds. Normally, Pike's Peak is visible about now. Yeah, I noticed the extra diesel. Just a precaution. Help us make it over the pass. Excuse me. Thank you for the ornament. It was just what my tree needed, and don't bother asking how I knew who it was from. -No, I know better than that. -Okay. I assume you saw the photo of my son? Oh, I didn't mean to snoop. Oh, well, of course you did. You're looking for a story, right? Well... He looks a lot like you. Well, he's... He's all grown up. Uh-huh. And he lives in California. -Oh, is that right? -Yep. So you'll be spending the holidays with him? Well, we haven't really talked in a few years. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, it's just... How it is. Not having a family myself, I may not be the best to give advice, but I will say this.. Don't let too much time pass between you and the people who are important to you. -All right? -Perhaps you're right. -Perhaps you should tell her that. -I tried. Well, try harder. -Beautiful, isn't it? -Sure is. -Can I borrow your scarf? -Oh, sure. -You cold? -No, it's not that. -Did something happen in Israel? -What? You boarded a train. You had everything, and you ran away. Did I say too much? I didn't have everything. That's funny, because I did. Really? I thought so. Do you realize that while we were together, you were kidnapped once, imprisoned twice, and almost killed? You kept taking crazy risks for the next story and the next story, and when you left out the door, I didn't know if you were going to make it back. -I didn't care about reporting anymore. -I cared about you. Ellie... I just wanted to go home. I wanted... I wanted a white picket fence and a husband who comes home at the end of the day, only you never asked. You gave me just a few minutes to make a decision. I had been telling you for years. You just didn't want to hear it. It took me months to work up the nerve to ask you to leave with me. I got my answer. Welcome, everyone, on this wonderful Christmas Eve day. I'm working without a script here, but sometimes that's the best. We don't always know where life will take us, especially when love's involved. What I see before me are two people who, despite the turns and twists on the track, are meant to be together. That's what true love is, finding a way to be together, no matter what, and what better time than Christmas to give someone your heart? Steve, do you take Julie for your wife? I do. -Julie.. -I do! There you go. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride now. Wow. ? Go get the ol' chimney sweeper ? ? Make sure the chimney is clear ? ? Time to get hummin' ? ? Santa is coming ? ? I love this time of the year ? ? I'll set the tree by the mantel ? ? You wrap the presents my dear ? ? Let's make the dishes everyone wishes ? ? I love this time of the year ? ? The snowflakes... ? -So I guess it's just you and me. -Hmm. -Would you care to dance? -With who? Just don't step on my feet. All right. ? I can't wait to join in the carols ? ? Raise up a couple good cheers ? ? I wouldn't miss this fabulous Christmas ? ? I love this time of the year... ? -You've got some moves. -Mm, I can sing, too. -But can you cook? -You'll find out. Sounds like they're on their first date. I don't think that's any of your business. Okay, here we go. One, two, three! Whoo! Oh! Oh, sorry. -This was probably meant for you. -No, no. You caught it. Aren't you going to ask me to dance? Maybe we could just talk. Do you think Max would throw our wedding? Although I refuse to get married on a train. A destination wedding could be nice, though. Maybe an island? Though if I get a part in this movie, then I'll be on location, and that might be a train, so we'll just keep the options open. Okay, uh, Lelia.. Am I rambling? I'm just so excited. The thought of never having to be Cuppy the Beaver again... Do you need more room, to get down on one knee? Or both knees and beg your forgiveness. -You don't want to marry me, Lelia. -What are you talking about? Well, I'm not the guy for you. I think you already know that. We both know what love looks like, and it's not us. So, what have we been doing all this time, then? I'm really sorry. And I'm sorry I ever got on this train. Looks like you have two women who aren't talking to you now. One more and you're in my league. This is not the story I wanted to write. Sometimes, those are the ones that end the best. -Ah! -Oh! -Higgins, what's going on? -I'm not sure. We're not scheduled to stop anywhere around here. Everything's going to be just fine, folks. -Trouble? -Oh, I'd say. -Can we go through it? -It's too risky. We don't know what's on the other side. So, what happens now? -Can we back up? -No, we can't do that either. There was a report of a slide a couple miles back, and the rail line has been shut down. I've been trying to reach the dispatcher, but there's no service. Radios and cell phones won't work. I've got nothing. Yeah. Me neither. -What does this mean? -It means... We're trapped. The important thing is to remain calm. In the meantime, we'll divide everyone between this car and the dining car to conserve energy. That way, we're all together, so bring your coats, sweaters, and blankets. -Our phones don't work. -That's just the storm, baby. How will anyone know we're here? Okay, we're going to make this an adventure, all right? Let's go build a fort. I've seen that look on your face before. The electricity comes from the generators in the diesel engines, so when we run out of fuel, we'll lose all power. It means no heat. How long do you think we have? I can't say, but it couldn't be too many hours before they find us here. Yeah. Might be a bit longer than that. -What do you mean? -There's no cell service out here. The mountains block the signal. Engineer hasn't been able to let control know we're stuck, let alone where we are. Anyway, I'd better go help the passengers. -Well, we've been through worse. -We have. ? Go get the ol' chimney sweeper ? ? Make sure the chimney is clear ? ? Time to get hummin' ? ? Santa is coming ? ? I love this time of the year... ? -Cocoa? -We found some more. Ooh, excellent. This is going to be the strongest pillow fort ever built on a train. Thanks, Mr. Kelly! We're still going to have Christmas Eve, aren't we? Of course we are. The best Christmas ever. You're really good with kids. Did you have your own? No, no, no. My wife was a teacher. I learned a few things. Oh. Well, she taught you well. You know, you're always looking for a story. How about that one? "Mr. Kelly finds his Christmas spirit". Yeah. Well, you know, the thing is, I spent so much time chasing stories all over the place, that I barely have one of my own. I don't believe that. I live with a houseplant that spends more time with my neighbors than with me. I have friends all over the world... Never see 'em. Most of the time, I'm completely alone. Maybe you just got off-track. Trainspeak, yeah. -I broke it off with Lelia. -Oh. -In case you were wondering. -I wasn't. She certainly seems like she's handling it all right. Yeah, she does. In fact, that's the happiest I think I've ever seen her. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah, she's all right. She's not you. What are they doing with those presents? Well, they brought 'em for their friends and family. Now that's us. -This was Ruth's. -That's beautiful. She always knew the right thing to do. And I think I know exactly what she would do right now. Excuse me... Everyone. I'm sure that none of us expected to spend Christmas Eve like this, but is it a bad thing for us, strangers until a few days ago, to spend this time together? Is it a bad thing to spend Christmas Eve sharing stories and giving away presents bought for our own families to other people? Now, if your marriage can survive a start like this, it will surely survive anything. I think maybe all of us are together for a reason. My wife used to say, "Hope begins when you stand in the dark, looking out at the light." Christmas is a time for miracles, and I believe that one is happening right now. Hear, hear! Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! Santa! Oh, merry Christmas! Ho, ho! Who's been naughty, and who's been nice? I've been nice! I've been nice! Oh, ho, ho, yes! Yes, please. I suppose I always knew your heart was somewhere else. Now I know where. I'm sorry, Lelia. Don't be. Max just offered me a role in his next movie, and I'm going to take it. Even if it shoots on a train? ? Deck the halls with boughs of holly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ? ? 'Tis the season to be jolly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ? ? Don we now our gay apparel ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la ? ? Troll the ancient yuletide carol ? ? Fa-la-la-la la-la-la-la! ? Perfect. Higgins? The temperature's dropped another 10 degrees. We can't just sit here until spring thaw. Railways have their schedules. They'll have figured we're missing by now. They've probably already got a search team underway. In this storm? There's a lot of track between here and L.A. Wait. Higgins? -What is it? -No, that wouldn't work. Right now I'll take the craziest idea you've got. Look, I know where there are a few ranches salted through the mountains out this way. Most of them have got electric and their own phone lines. That's good. We can let the dispatcher know exactly where we are. Yeah, but the chances of finding one of them on foot, in this weather, is close to impossible. -It's not impossible on skis. -Tom... I've got skis, boots, goggles. It's rough terrain out there. I can handle it. I just need you to point me in the right direction. Higgins said I'd find you here. What are you doing? Well, you're not going to get very far out there on downhill skis, but with these... Eleanor... I'm going with you. No, you're not. You'd be smarter teaming up with me than trying to go it alone. That's nothing new. One more assignment? One more. Don't do this. Max... I don't want to lose you, Eleanor. You're my family. I'll bet you say that to all your writers. No, I don't. Don't worry. I'll keep her safe, Max. Any last-minute predictions? I thought you weren't a believer. Right now I believe in anything. I see an amazing rescue. Works for me. Ready? Be careful! Come back safe. Both of you. Whoa. You all right? Yeah. Never better. Who would have thought we'd find each other after all this time and wind up in a snowstorm on a mountaintop? Yeah, well, if it was easy, anyone could do it. I missed this. This? Yeah, you and me... Taking on the world. Let's go. Wait up. 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the cars, not a creature was stirring, on Earth or on Mars. The river was filled with logs and... Roxanne? Oh, now, where did this come from? Not from my sleigh. Oh? You've got a secret admirer here. Ooh. Mm! Hey, my sunglasses. Oh. What is this stuff? Oh, boy. I think these are the things that were reported missing. I guess whoever took them was touched by the Christmas spirit. I think we all were. Mm. Excuse me. I think these... Belong to you? Our rings. Thank you! It's a sign. It is a sign. Are we even going in the right direction? I don't know, Eleanor. Still no signal. What happened to "Ellie"? What did happen to her? I guess she lost her way for a little while. Well, maybe we both did. I want you to know, I had those rings in my pocket the day you left me. I wanted to ask you a million times, but it just... Just kept getting away from me. The truth is, I was scared, and I thought if we settled down, we'd lose everything that was magic. Now, after all these years, it's my biggest regret that I didn't go after you. You were the love of my life. You still are. I guess I never stopped loving you either. I really tried. -Did you hear that? -Yeah. Yeah! Yeah! They should have been back by now. I never should have let her go. What are you doing out here? We're hoping for a Christmas miracle. Look! You've got to see this! An amazing rescue... I was right! Sam. Hey. Hey, where'd the engine go? I thought the thief returned everything. Oh. Almost everything, I guess. Kenny, what's your best Christmas drink? For you folks, the Mistletoe Fizz.. drink one and you'll kiss the one you love. Drinks for the house on me. Merry Christmas, everyone! Hey-hey! Merry Christmas. Hey, wait. You're in the Film Actor's Union? I thought you said you worked for your father's firm. Uh, I do. Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I did a commercial once. -Oh, really? For what? -Pudding. Pudding? Ha! Must have missed that one. I've worked for my dad long enough. I guess I have some dreams. Hey, don't we all? 'Tis the season. Tell them, Higgins. Well, the railway brass kind of hired me back. That's great! Congratulations! Oh, I wouldn't make too much into it. It's probably too much egg nog at the office party. Aw. Now, don't you downplay yourself. They hired you back because you're a hero. Oh, no. I have to live up to that now? Oh, Higgins! Agnes? Are you the thief? Train marshal. That... That I didn't see coming. Well, I wouldn't be very good at my job if you did. I found that train in John Kelly's compartment. What? Yeah. John Randolph Kelly, to be precise. I ran his prints. He does have a record. It's an old one. -Petty theft, 40 years ago. -40 years? That's a lifetime. Turns out, he met his wife and he gave up his criminal life. He got a job, he got married, and, by all accounts, led an exemplary life for the next four decades... Huh. Until now. She died. He felt lost. Yeah. I don't know, maybe the holidays are affecting me, but I don't know what to do. It's probably not my call, but what if this is all a cry for help? What if that connection with other people is what he's always been looking for? And besides, is it really a crime if he gave everything back? I got a second chance on this train. Maybe he deserves one, too. Aw. Fade in. Train station. The camera follows a woman. Hesitant, she boards the train, not yet knowing this trip would take her through the rugged terrain of her own heart... You don't take the Christmas train to get somewhere fast. You take it for the journey... And what a journey it is, because with every stop it makes, a little bit of America gets on and says "hello", and sometimes even "Merry Christmas". People don't rush, because that's not what trains are for. They're not just about the destination. They're about thejoy of taking the trip. I'm not saying that riding a train will change your life... But it certainly changed mine. Tom? Listen, I, uh... I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate what you've done. Oh, I didn't do anything. Oh, you did, you and everyone on this train, and I just want you to know that this journey has... It's changed my life. When I lost Ruth, I thought that I had no purpose left in the world, but I found it here again, on the Christmas train, and now I want to share what she taught me with others. He's going to Chicago, to work with the Boys' Youth Club. -I think I can contribute something. -Oh, I know you can. Thank you, John. Good luck. I won't forget you, Agnes. Aw. Well, you bet you won't. Right? Mom! Mom! Davey? What are you doing here? Well, I heard on the news that the train got stranded. I was worried you were on it. Oh, so you came all the way just to see me? Of course, Mom. It's Christmas. Yes. Yes, it is. Now, Mom, look, I know we haven't spent that much time together in a while, but... It's okay. That's okay. I know. I know you're so busy. No Mom, it's not okay and I'm sorry. I missed you a lot. You know I missed you, too, but I.. I totally understand. Mom, stop, okay. No more excuses. From now on, I want us to be more like a family again. Please? I.. I'd love that. Okay. Good. Then let's get going. Where are we going? Oh, I made Christmas dinner at my place. Wow. And there's someone I'd like you to meet. I would love that. Max? You ready? What is that? Apparently... Max wrote a script? "Misty: something happened in Israel. You had everything, but you ran away." "Julie: his parents "think I'm not good enough for him because I grew up in small-town Kentucky"? Wait... "Lelia: I can see this is a lot to throw at you. "take your time and think about it. We have two days to L.A., right?" So this entire trip was a Max Powers production? I thought this was going to be a love story on a train, but now I'm thinking murder. Was everyone on that train part of your cast? -You give me too much credit. -Uh, not... Not all of them. -You orchestrated this whole thing? -Some. The rest was the magic of the Christmas train. I just put a few pieces together... I knew you had your one big love. I did some digging, and when I found out that Tom was going to be on the train, I thought, what better setting? A captive audience. And then I brought Steve and Julie in to remind you two of what you once had. Well, the two of you made a very convincing couple. To be honest, after the first five minutes, we weren't really acting. Thanks for introducing us, Max. And then I wanted a character like Misty because I thought she might restore your belief in fate. So you don't actually know what my lucky day is? I would say that that's today. I'd agree. And I brought Lelia on board to force you to make a decision you've been putting off too long. He's right, you know. You two are so good together, and I'm not acting. -Thank you. -Mm. -Oh, do me a favor? -What? Write me a really good part in the movie, okay? Make me a villain. They're always the most fun to play. Max, why would you do all of this? You know me. I could never resist a good love story. Mine was Patti, and Tom is yours, and there's no one I would want to find love more than you, Eleanor. You're not too mad at me, are you? How could I be? You're not going to ask me if I'm angry? Well, by that dumb grin on your face, I think it'd be safe to say that you've never been happier. Thanks, Max. Thanks for everything. Oh, I almost forgot... I guess they did bring us good luck after all. Not just for you. Won't be needing these any longer. Tom? I've been searching for something for a long time... And it's you, Ellie. I love you. I'll do anything I can to make you happy, whether we're in a foxhole or a snowstorm or a little house with a white picket fence. Will you take me with my faults, weaknesses, and utter stupidity? -Will you marry me? -Yes! I predict these two are going to make it. I think there's a chance. Why don't I take you two for dinner to celebrate? I have my regular table at Musso & Frank. Uh, you know what, Max, I think we're going to take a rain check. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Thank you so much for everything. Thanks, Max. There's something about a train, right? There's something about a train. So... So... What are you doing New Year's Eve? Coming up to the top of the hour, looks as though the weatherman was right, it really is snowing out there, folks. It seems like Los Angeles has been touched by the magic of Christmas. ? And so... ? ? It started to snow ? ? He decided to go ? ? And there went another yuletide ?
