On september 22, 2004, Oceanic flight 815 fell from the sky. Come on! Get over here and give me a hand! 48 passengers survived... i'm kate. Jack. On a forgotten island... first plane crash? What gave it away? I can always spot the newbies. A long way from home. The pilot said we were over a thousand miles off course. Terrific. They were strangers... stop! Thrown together. Let's trust this guy! We're all in this together, man. Searching for answers... do you want to know a secret? Hoping for rescue. I want to get off this island More than anything else in the world. And what they could not understand at the time... i've looked into the eye of this island... was that this island Presented a chance for salvation... and at i saw was beautiful. A rare opportunity To start their lives over again. But this. It's a polar bear. Was no ordinary island... kate, damn it, run! But a place unlike any they could ever imagine. Jack! Where are we? And they discovered... hello there. They were not alone. They've attacked us... no! Murdered us... this is our island. Please! Abducted us... i'll do anything you want! Why don't you just shoot me? We're not killers... james. And they couldn't help but wonder... why do you finit so hard to believe? Why do you find it so easy?! What is this place? I want some friggin' answers! Why did they survive? This'll be your last chance. And will they ever... if we can't live together... be saved? We're gonna die alone. Hey! Everything's gonna be okay. We gonna stay here tonight, okay? Together. Just about everyone among the rvivors Looked to jack as their leader. The sun comes up in three hours, And we're all gonna be here to see that happen. You did a good thing, and taking care of everybody And just giving them something to count on. So what is it about that guy-Jack? It's that he's a doctor, right? Yeah, ladies dig the doctors. Hell, give me a couple of band-Aids, A bottle of roxide, i could run this island, too. You're actually comparing yourself to jack? Jack was a spinal surgeon With an unyielding drive to make things right... i can't feel anything. I know. Even when all hope was lost. He met sarah when her spine was crushed in a car accident. It's okay. I know i'm not gonna be dancing anymore. I'm gonna fix you. After a miraculous surgery... can you feel this? Yes. This man of science may have wondered If something greater was at work. And he and sarah were married. But when the marriage ended, jack's faith was shattered. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix. D when he survived that horrific crash, One might think he'd see it as fate Rather than mere coincidence. It was a strong point of contention Between jack and john locke. I think that's why You and i don't see eye to eye sometimes, jack, Because you're a man of science. And what does that make you? Well, i'm a man of faith. Yothink we crashed on this place by coincidence? Each one of us was brought here for a reason. And who brought us here, john? The island. The island chose you, too, jack. It's destiny. John locke was a man no one wanted... This is... awkward. Not even his estranged father, A con man who used locke to get what he needed. You stole my kidney? You needed a father figure, and i needed a kidney. Get over it. Locke finally found the courage to confront his father. I'm a con man, not a murderer. Phone's right over there, john. Aah! Oh! Aah! But he was left paralyzed. And even worse, his faith was lost. But when oceanic 815 crashed on the island, John locke was reborn. What if everything that happened here Happened for a reason? He found new purpose In a place he didn't want to leave And shared his renewed spirit with fellow survivors, Like claire, the single mother-To-Be. It's my birthday today. At least your birthdays will be close together, You and your baby, and that's good luck. You believe in that? I believe in a lot of things. Happy birthday, claire. Thank you. It's hard to quantify the power of this island. It certainly is a beauful place. Come on, freckles. You some sort of navel-Gazin', no fun, mopey type? For centuries, numerous people from all walks of life Have been drawn to the island. Welcome to the island... among them Were teams of scientists from the dharma initiative... ...unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating... outsiders who built laboratories And atteted to understand The island's very unique properties. Hold it! Stop! Do you hear that?! "... Serenade. " That's gotta be close, right? Radio waves at this frequency bounce off the ionosphere. It could be coming from anywhere. Or any time. Just kidding, dude. And for a very long time, The island's original inhabitants persevered. The oceanic survivors called these people The "others." And when flight 815 crashed, The life the others enjoyed was threatened. But their leader Was very determined to protect them. Goodwin! You run, you can make that shore in an hour. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em. Listen. Learn. Don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go. And he would preserve their privacy at any cost. Did you see it? A plane fell out of the sky, mikhail. Of course we saw it. Oceanic flight 815. 324 people onboard, including the flight crew. I want detailed files on every single passenger. The files would reveal That a spinal surgeon was onboard the plane. What a coincidence for this man Who learned he had a tumor on his spine. Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your l4 vertebra. So he gathered information on the survivors. That him? Yes. He's cute. Why are we doing this? Shephard will never agree to do the surgery. No, i can convince him to do it. How? Same way i get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, And i exploit it. And when the time was right, He sent for the doctor and a few of his friends. Hugo, you can go back to your camp. What about my friends? Your friends are coming home with us. Hello, jack. The leader of the others was keeping jack, kate and sawyer At an abandoned dharma station. You brought me here to operate on you. You want me to save your life. If you cooperate, We send you home. Where are kate and sawyer? They're fine, and they're close. You okay, freckles? Yeah. You? Swell. I requested that cage, but whatever. Hi, jack. I'm juliet. Juliet was asked to look after jack. We know exactly who you are, jack shephard. You don't know anything about me. I know that you're a spinal surgeon. I know that you were married And that you contested the divorce. I know your father died in sydney. What is that? This, jack... is your life. Thank you for, uh, Taking the time to let us make our pitch, dr. Burke. Sure. What do you see? Juliet was a fertility specialist. You have a gift. Now don't you feel You're meant to do something significant with it? She was asked to come to the island to find out why All the pregnant women there were dying. My name is benjamin linus. I'm really looking forward to working with you. But juliet was unsuccessful. The mothers keep dying. Then we'll find more mothers. I wanna go home. That's not our agreement. You need to stay here until your work is finished. It's impossible. Juliet and jack grew to understand to each other. They both wanted off the island. But jack was only willing to go so far. You need to be in surgery yesterday. All right, then. Whatever you need, it's yours. No, i think you misunderstood me. I didn't say i was gonna do it. I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die. It was clear that jack needed more convincing, So an appeal was made to his friends. Aah! Hey! Thman standing behind me- That man is going to kill sawyer. But if you come with me, There's something you can do for ushat will save his life. He it's gonna be all right. Jack... you have to do it. What? They're gonna kill sawyer! There are two very different sides to kate. She's the classic girl next door. She's also a fugitive. After killing her mother's abusive husband, She was on the run from the law for quite some time. Katherine, what did you do? I took care of you, ma. Kate was finally apprehended in australia... hey, kate. But founfreedom... when oceanic 815 conveniently went down. On the island, the two very different sides of kate Were reflected in two very different men. There's jack- The doctor and noble leader. Kate. And there's sawyer - The bad boy, A man she found herself drawn to. Jack saw kate and sawyer together, And it broke his heart. But instead of getting angry, He made a decision to help them. I'll get it out-Your mor. But i need your word. Need to get the hell off this island. Done. The surgery began as planned, but it wasn't long Before jack took matters into his own hands. What happened? Is he okay? I just made a small incision in ben's kidney sac. If i don't stitch that back upin the ne Now get in here and bring that walkie-Talkie Jack! You have about an hour head start Before they come after you. If i don't get a call from you In the next hour, i'm gonna know something went wrong, And he dies! We've got a boat. They're letting us go. So you're safe - You and sawyer? Yeah Promise me that you'll never come back here for me. Kate and sawyer were set free, Leaving jack behind with juliet to look after Their recovering patient. The two shared common purpose and seemed to grow closer. He said that if i helped you, That he would finally let me go home. But kate wouldn't let go of jack so easily. Kate, where are you going? They've got him, and we have to get him back. I owe him that. I'll go around and cover the back. You head in through the side door. What are you doing here? Get out of here. Ck- Kate, they're watching me. Get back, doc. Kate's rescue attempt failed, But jack had a plan of his own. I made a deal with them. They're gonna let me go. Where? Home. Jack was determined to get off the island. But john locke Had a very special connection with this place... i'm looking for the submarine. What submarine? You one you use to travel to and from the island. And he had no intention of letting anyone leave. What are you doing here, john? I'm sorry, jack. Sorry for what? Whoa! Jack and kate returned to camp And reunited with their friends. Juliet came along as jack's guest But was not a welcome visitor. What the hell is she doing here? Why don't i ever have to explain myself to you? You were standing right next to me When that submarine exploded. In that moment, i saw it in your eyes. You wanna get off this island more than anything else In the world. It makes you one of us. Johnocke chose to sy behind with the others, Who were quite taken with his connection to the island. Don't mind them. They're all just excited you're here. Excited? We've been waiting for you. So did you tell him? Did i tell who what? Did you tell the doc? About you and me. No. But he knows. He saw us on one of those surveillce monitors. Perverts. Anyway, he knows. Well, now that that's out of the way, How about a little afternoon delight? Come on. Freckles, wait. Now hold... do you need me to make you a mix tape? Yeah, why don't you do that? It's gonna be all right. Jack's gonna be all right. We all are. Well, what a relief. Hugo reyes was a man of hope, But his life before the crash Didn't inspire much optimism. Hugo. Hey, something wrong with your meds there? Nouh... Me and dave were just, you know... talking. Why don't you get a little closer together? Hugo was confined to a mental institution. Say "cheese." "Cheese." "Queso." A traumatic event in his life Had caused him to lose touch with reality. There were 23 people on that deck. It was built to hold eight, and it would've collapsed Whether you went out there or not. Dude... on the island, Hugo went to great lengths to keep his nity. Dave! You okay, hurley? Did either of you see a guy run through here? In a bathrobe? With a coconut? No. I saw a polar bear on rollerblades with a mango. And one day, He made a surprising discovery in the jungle. Ugh! But hugo could never have known The story behind the van he found. Can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong? Chill out. Let the man do his thing. Dude, that beer's been sittin' there Since before "rocky iii." Skeletor seems to like it. That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family. Oh, and a name. It's roger workman. "Work man"? I'm a janitor? I'm sorry, mr. Lin. I didn't come here to clean up after you. Years ago, roger linus came to the island To work for the dharma initiative. But this venture didn't go as he'd hoped, And he took out his frustrations On his only son-Benjamin. It's your birthday. Sorry i forgot. It's kinda hard to celebrate on the day you killed your mom. We went for a hike. You had to come early. Now she's gone, And i'm stuck here on this island... with you. Young ben soon met the island's iginal inhabitants... i don't want to go back there. The others. Take me with you. Maybe that can happen... but you're gonna have to be very, very patient. That young boy grew into a man Who was not afraid to do what needed to be done. You know, i've missed her, too. But the difference is That for as long as i can remember, I've had to put up with you. Good-Bye, dad. His father would no longer be a problem. Neither would the rest of the dharma initiative, Thanks to this man... you want us to go get his body? No, leave him out there. Who beca the new leader of the others. But after his surgery, some began to doubt him, And john locke was more than willing to tell him why. You've been here 80 days, john. I've been here my entire life. So how is it that you think you know this island Beer than i do? Because you're in the wheelchair, And i'm not. But locke still had much to learn, So he was presented with a surprising test. Dad? When people join us here on this island, They need to make a gesture of commitment. That's why you're gonna have to kill your father. I'm sorry. He's not who we thought he was. It's beautiful, isn't it? No matter how much time you spend on the island, You just never get tired of this view. But we haven't been formally introduced. I'm richard. Richard was one of the others, And he had some advice for locke. When word got back here That there was a man with a broken spine on the plane Who could ddenly walk again, well... pele here began to get very excited. But ben doesn't want anyone to think you're special, john. And why are you telling me this? I want for you to find your purpose, And to do that, Your father has to go, john. And since you're not gna do it, I'm gonna suggest someone else. Why would sawyer kill my father? He doesn't even know him. Keep reading. Open this door! Wake up. He's here. Get under the bed. Don't make a sound. Open this door! James ford was just a young boy when his father was swindled. James, stop it! He went into a rage and killed his wife... before killing himself. James adopted the name of the man who conned his father, Becoming a con himself. And as sawyer, He spent a life of vengeance. Sawyer. Vengeance so blind... you don't know what you're doing, do ya? He killed the wrong man. But it wasn't until he rched the island That he found the true con man he'd been hunting for so long. What's your name? A con man goes by many names, friend. I've been an seward, anthony cooper, Tom sawyer, paul - Tom sawyer? Look, i only took her money. It ain't my fault your dad overreacted. This deadly act of revenge Provided both locke and sawyer a chance for resolution. Thank you. And locke was one step closer to the answers he sought. You said that if i killed my father, You'd tell me everything i wanted to know About the island. You probably think I'm the leader of this little community. But that's not entirely true. We all answer to someone, john. And whom might that be? His name is jacob. I think there is no jacob. I think your people are idiots If they believe you take orders from someone else. You are the man behind the curtain... ?? Those challenging words underscored The threat locke posed to the leader of the others. So locke was brought to a cabin in the jungle. Jacob, i'm here with john locke. It was a final test to see if he was truly special. Aren't you going to say hello, john? Do you really think there's someone there? I know there's someone there. If locke was capable of communicating with jacob, Then he most certainly was a threat. I'm sorry that you're too limited to see. Help me. What did you just say? I didn't say anything. I heard you. You said "help- That's enough! You've had your fun! What did you hear in there, john? You're a fraud, And it's time your people were told the truth. And this is not the way we came. I wanted to show you something first. The dharma initiative. The couldn't even coexist With the island's original inhabitants, And when it became clear that one side had to go, I did what i had to do. I was one of the people that was smart enough To make sure that i didn't end up in that ditch... which makes me Considerably smarter than you, john. Uhh! Why did you do this? Because you heard him. Now i need to know what he said. He said... "help me." Well, i certainly hope he helps you, john. Who's that? Her name's penny. That's not bad, des. T bad at all. When desmond hume met penny widmore, It was love at first sight. Very nice to meet you, penny. But desmond lost his way and ended up in prison For a time. When he was released, He entered a sailing race around the world To prove his worth to the love of his life. How did you find me? I have a lot of money, desmond. With enough money and determination, You can find anyone. I'm gonna win this race, penny, And in a year, i'll be back. But desmond encountered a storm, And his boat shipwrecked on the island. He was taken to an underground science station Built by the dharma initiative. It was there that he spent three years entering a code Into a computer every 108 minutes. That is, until the day locke decided to see What would happen if they didn't enter the code. System failure... it was not a good idea. Buit provided desmond with an opportunity To prove himself a hero. ? Desmond released the magnetic pressure And prevented global catastrophe, And in the process... made the island visible to the outside world For a brief moment. Hello? Ms. Widmore? I think we found it. The explosion of the hatch had another effect as well. Desmond began having visions of the future. When i saw the lightning hit the roof, You were electrocuted. No matter what i try to do, You're gonna die, charlie. Charlie pace was a drug addict, But he had come a long way in his time on the island, Finding the strength to overcome his addiction. I'm proud of you, charlie. We'll get through this together. And in so doing, he became dear to claire... and her son aan. I love you. But now charlie faced the knowledge That he might soon die. You've had another one of your visions, haven't you? Desmond's vision contained another startling revelation. Is that a helicopter? Rescue. The island was about to have a visitor. Sorry. Desmond. Her name was naomi, and she claimed To be working for penny on a mission to find desmond. Oh, my god. I understand your helicopter crashed onto the island. Actually, it crashed in the water. From whe exactly did you take off? A ship-Freighter, About 80 nautical miles west of here- We're part of a search and recovery team. And i take it you have no means whatsoever of communicating With that freighter of yours? There's a woman in hurley's tent Who parachuted onto the island yesterday. Why didn't anyone tell me this? Because they don't trust you. We should tell her. Juliet confided in her new companions, Revealing a plan by the others to take all the pregnant women Among the survivors. Juliet, it's ben. I'm sending three teams To extract kwan the night after tomorrow. If you determine that anyone else is pregnant, Mark their tents, and we'll take them, too. That was not good news for sun kwan. She and her husband jin were unable to have children. This issue caused great stress in their marriage And eventually drove sun to the arms of another man. Life on the island brought th closer, And the special power the island Gave them hope for a child. You're pregnant. But a pregnancy on the island carried great risk. I want to know about your research. What happens to pregnant women? They all die. So juliet brought sun to a dharma medical station To determine the date of conception. It's right down here. If she conceived on the island, She could die during childbirth. You got pregnant on the island. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, sun. It's jin's. Sun was happy, but she was in great danger. The others were coming To take the pregnant women, and she was a target, So jack revealed his plan for an ambush. Hiding's pointless. They're just gonna keep coming back. So i went out and i found some help. For the very first time, we know exactly what they want, When they're coming get it, and they have no idea. So tomorrow nigh we stop living in fear of them, Because when they show up... we're gonna blow 'em all to hell. A confrontation was imminent. If you leave right now, how long will it take you To reach their camp? If i take my ten best, We can s up to hit 'em by nightfall. They you better get going. Juliet may not be ready. What if she hasn't had time to identify- Then we'll take alltheir women. If any of 'em are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em. A planor rescue was hastened. Whatever that interference is, It's blocking our ability to send our own transmission. Ben is using one of the dharma stations To block all of the signals off of the island except for ours. What station? They call it "the looking glass." Ben told us that the station was completely flooded. I think i'll be able to find the relay switch And disable it. No, i'm not letting you go on some suicide mission Just to flip the switch. Well, someone has to do it, or we'll never leave this island. I'll do it. Charlie already knew what had to be done. Desmond had a vision that told him why. You're inside a hatch. There's a blinking yellow light. You flick the switch, the light goes off, And then you drown. If you don't, there won't be any rescue. This time, you have to die. It's dangerous, isn't it? It's what needs to be done to get us all rescued. I'll be fine, claire. Don't worry about me. Charlie was willing to sacrifice his life To save claire and his friends. And when he dove down deep beneath the ocean, He'd already accepted his fate. But the station was not flooded after all. Aah! I'm alive! Though charlie never would have guessed He'd find others there to greet him. ??? Good. Good. Hey. Hey. So here we go again, huh? Here we go again. Jack, no matter what happens here, i want you to keep moving. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, But i'm not giving it up for nothing. Sayid jarrah was no stranger to risk. If you prove you're willing to cooperate, I think i can get them to free you. As a soldier in the republican guard, He put his life on the line for the woman he loved. Guard! There's a supply truck that will be leaving shortly. Come with me. They would kill my family. I don't have your courage. You have more than you know. Sayid set nadia free And has been searching for her ever since. All right, let's do it. And as jack led his people out of camp, Sayid was once again prepared to die. Along with bernard and jin, He was ready to ambush the others. Charlie's gonna be fine. Yeah. Of course he is. I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here? I'm here to turn off your jamming equipment, In there, next to the flashing yellow light. How did you find out about this station? Juliet told us. She's one of us now, In case you haven't heard. And juliet was correct With her warning that the others were coming. It's empty! Get away from the tents! Don't. Finger off the trigger. Why were there only two explosions? It didn't work. We have a plan, and for all we know, it worked. Everything's gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, okay? What?! They're all dead. They killed seven of our- Tom! Calm down and tell him the good news. What good news? We caught three of 'em- The ones who stayed behind to blow up the tents. What do you want us to do? Kill 'em? No. Not yet. Charlie! Bloody hell. You all right? Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide, des. Hide, hide. There's people in there. I'm going back to the beach. No way. We keep moving. I ain't asking permission. What do you think you're gonna get done, Alone and unarmed? He won't be alone. I'll go with him. No. I know where there are some guns. You don't have to do that. Yeah, jack, i kinda do. Don't do anything stupid. I won't if you won't. You have to understand. Everything i did, i did for the island. I need you to help me clean up this mess that i've made. I need you to kill charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism Continues to function at all costs. Hey, guys, wait up! I'm coming with you guys. No way. Not a chance. I just wanna help. Please? For god sakes, hugo, look at you. Yore just gonna get in the way. You wanna get us killed? He didn't mean it, you know-Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, He didn't me it. If he didn't mean it, why did he say it? He was trying to protect you. Hey. Why are you sticking up for sawyer? He'd never do it for you. Because i love you. Hello, jack. We need to talk. The woman you're traveling with- She's not who she says she is. Then who is she? She's a representative of some people Who have been trying to find this island, jack. If you phone her boat, Every single living person on this island Will be killed. Get that device- The phone she carries with her - And give it to me. I'not going anywhere. Your plan killed seven of my people, But the ones that you failed to kill Are now holding your friends- Jin, sayid, bernard- At gunpoint. Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, Shoot all three of them. No. I'm getting them all off the island-All of 'em! Let me ask you something, jack. Why do you wanna leave the island? What is it that you so desperately wanna get back to? Your father's dead. Your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get bk to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? Just get me the phone, jack. No. Ten seconds. Bring me the phone. No. I'm not bluffing. I won't do it! Five... four... three... no. No! I'm so sorry, jack. Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. He's lost it. I mean, look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damn sand, We should've killed them for real. Uhh! Aah! Attention, others. Come in, others. Hurley? Dude, i'm back at the beach. I saved 'em. They're okay? Juliet- Everyone's fine- Juliet, sayid, jin, bernard. Yeah, dude. I told you, i saved 'em all. What about charlie? Did he make it bacyet? Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine. With desmond's help, charlie escaped his caors In the looking glass and completed his mission, Giving his friends a chance to contact the freighter. Incoming transmission? Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, i can hear you! This is penelope - Penelope widmore. How did you get this frequency? Desmond?! Did you just say "desmond"? Yeah. He's here. He's with me. Is he okay? He's brilliant! Hey, are you on e boat? What? What boat? Uh, n-Naomi, the parachutist. I'm not on a boat. Who's naomi? Is desmond there? Charlie! Not penny's boat Shh, hey, aaron. It's okay, sweetie. What is it? What's your boyfriend's name- The rock star who swam down to the station? Charlie. Charlie just got us rescued. Jack! Jack, he did it! Your friend bloody well did it. What? The green light-It's on. The jamming stopped. The airwaves were now open, And the survivors made the call for help. I've got it! I've got a signal! This will be your last chance, jack. I'm telling you, making that call Is the beginning of the end. I'm getting something. What did you do? What i had to. Now step back. Put the phone down. No. You're done keeping me on this island. You're not supposed to do this. Hello? Who is this? Who is this? I'm one of the survivors of oceanic flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location? Hell, yeah, we can. Sit tight. Rescue... the moment they never dreamed would come. That could??? Free them from their past Without truly knowing what the future would hold? Hello? It's me. Whoa, whoa. Wait. Don't-Don't hang up. Please. I just need to see you. Please. Yeah. Yeah, out at the airport. You know where. Hey. Hey. Why did you call me, jack? I've been flying a lot. What? Every friday night, i... I fly from l.A. To tokyo or... singapore Or sydney. Why? Because i want it to crash, kate. I actually close my eyes, And i pray that i can get back. This is not gonna change. No, i'm sick... of lying. We made a mistake. I have to go. We... were not supposed to leave. Yes, we were. We have to go back, kate. We have to go back!
