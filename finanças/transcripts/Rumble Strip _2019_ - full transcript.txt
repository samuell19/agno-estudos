He was a preacher, my dad. Mom was a gardener. My baby sister, the dreamer. We were a family. Driving with a carload of books through towns that lost their name. That car was our life back then. It started with headaches. Neighborhoods disappeared overnight. People ran as if you could run from the sky. When the nights froze over, our parents kept us safe in that car. Taught us who we were supposed to be. Is it plugged in? Daddy said "beware of false prophets that come to you in sheep's clothing." Security breach, gate 14. Did you see what he looked like? May I see your weapon? Is this what he wants? Protocol. Go get 'em, boys. We need to get you in the ground. You said never again. It's just protection. Hey. You're not like them and you bring that gun here. Scavengers on the road. They're just people. Like you and me. I had that dream again. At the ocean. Over and over. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. I don't wanna lose you back to that world. You're never gonna lose me. How dare you! It's him. He's traveling with an illegal mutt, mixed race. They stole five gallons and a handgun. Bring him to him. The girl? Cute. What are the numbers for today? 1.6 terawatts, core is stable. I want it doubled by next week. Your salt bath will be ready in 20 minutes. It's just a tremor. Careful. Daddy long legs? Aren't they... Extinct. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers. Some have entertained angels unawares. Love is patient! Love is kind! It does not envy! It does not boast! It is proud! It is not proud! He himself will be saved! That your bodies are temples of the holy spirit! Who is it, you, whom you have received from God. You! He himself will be saved. Only as one escaping through the flames. Corinthians 3:15. Have you heard the word of God? I've read it. Where you goin'? I'm an onlookin' man. My travel snapped. You're the only humans I've seen. For a trade, I can fix it. Hm? Oh! Wine from the south. Wine from the south! Okay, think, think. Where is it? Oh, where did I put it? Um, okay, I think it's here. Ah, no, it's in this other one over here. Don't go away. Here it is. I don't judge. The Lord don't judge, if you're a Christian, Muslim or Jew. I'm a sinner. What about lady here? Is she a sinner too? Saint. Why are you going north? Water. You got a map? I got a feeling. Bad luck carrying a weapon. Nothing good come from it. Goodnight. Don't cut yourself. Are we gonna be okay? Yeah. Once we get past the city, we'll be safe. Even in our sleep, pain, which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart. Until, in our own despair, against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of God. Come to sleep, baby. I can't. Let's go. Who are you with? Who are you with? He's a child! I'm sorry. How old are you? 14. Well, where's your family? Love is patient. Love is kind. It's too risky. She's got no one. Very good! I have hunger. I have hunger. Very good! So good! Let's try "we have hunger." Very good, you are on a roll. The Spanish word... Feel good? We ready? Boots on the ground on one of them. The boys will be happy to have him back. He's awake! Mister! No, you were not authorized to drop a smoke bomb. - Visibility is at 30%. - She was in the way! I decided to grab her first. - She was- - You decided! Grab the girl. We'll get him. Like the eyes of my papa. Open it! It can't see. Me and the boys missed you. What did you do? I tried to kill him. You may get your revenge. But not without a price. This is my home. I'm staying here. Chinese evergreen elm. They stay green all year. Dead now. It's still useful. You can't be on the fence in life. Or in killing. You gotta own it. Imagine that. Once a captain. Now look at you. You're never gonna lose me. It's a surprise! Patience is the mother of invention. - Good fortune. - Good fortune. Charlie, don't be a fuckin' idiot! This is the plan! What, what, what's the date? One week from the day, sir. One week from today, Charlie. Now get your shit together. Riley? How long we been here? Too long. We left the food. What's gonna happen to her? She'll be okay. It's me they want. Where are we going? Back. The one you killed, you knew? He has a witch. I know. He is a monster. Mom said nature will return, but not us. The only humans left would be the mystics of the canyon. We've got the girl, but the man is still alive. Burn him. Do you know where you are? Nod. Yes or no. Do it now. You're on private property. One of the last of its kind. Your friend, used to be my friend. Did you know that? He's not like you. He used to work for me. And now he's free. Have you ever seen one of these? Should've taken the main road. She's beautiful, I must say. Lover boy's alive, coming this way. We can't locate him on the map, so he must have a shield. I think he's coming to rescue her. Good. Send another drone immediately. Already taken care of. One tracker made the trip just this morning. Make sure. Her skin, it's unlike anything I've ever seen. Riley? She's fertile. Mister. Mister. Mister. Let's go. What happened to your hand, mister? Someone always profits off the fear in people's hearts. What have you done? Scavenger. What have you done? How dare you! A thief! A scavenger. A scavenger. What have you done? Who do you think you are? I can smell it. The gas pumping through these walls. Who'd have thought we'd find so much more? There's always more. What are the numbers? 34 terawatts. Mm! You have a meeting, Riley. I gotta go. I've got a special upload for you. Goodnight, mister. What have you done? Katie said nothing could kill us. We were meant for so much more. "Ah!" Ah. Francisco Flores. Congratulations, you've been selected. How about a song? Not gonna sing anymore. When we get there... You see her... You run. You run for your life. I'll kill her. She changed my pa. My pa drove our car off the road. It was me, my little sister, Katie, my mom. We'd wake up to this sound. Like a train comin'. The rumble strip. Rumble. Four grooves carved in cement. To keep you awake, Daddy died. Everybody died. I don't know what they done to me. I've gotta find her. I've gotta find her. She's my.... Rumble strip. The tremors are increasing. Charlie will want an explanation. Numbers? 15 terawatts just this morning. I want more. Where will I sit at the party? Can I sit next to you? The table is for shareholders, Carmen. You know I'm all yours. Right, Riley? I know, baby. You're my girl. Can we rest? Just keep going. Mister! Mister. Mister! Defector 2285 has been terminated. Yeah, Charlie. Jacob is getting anxious. How the fuck do I calm him down when I'm in the dark? It is double what we agreed on. In two days, this will be done. You understand the position you're putting me in? Trust me, in two days you're gonna sign the sweetest deal of your life. I don't trust shit. The only reason I'm in this is because Jacob said it was gonna be easy money. There's nothin' easy about you. I'll see you in two days. If I ain't happy, nobody's gonna be happy. And you want me happy. Look in the furnace. You can eat what you want, but not the fish. Only we can eat it. It's poisoned. You escape the fort? On our way. Well, you must hate living. He needs knowing hand, to cut the poison, or else he'll die. Felicia will look. In return... What? The weapon. Thirsty, huh? We've been drinking the runoff all summer. There's plenty if you can risk the RCAs. RC? Robot controlled aircraft. Death from above. Somewhere, vigilantes sitting in their board rooms, wearing silicon dining-it style. Somewhere. Found it. I say fuck 'em all. We're on our own. He's lucky it was poison. We cannot heal an altered brain. Stay. You're not ready to stand. Where's the gun? We have it safe. We? This is San Juan. Or Sacramento. Don't really know anymore. North. We're the mystics of the canyon. The girl. She's safe. "Sky at different times of the night." Rest now. She'll be very useful. You're sick. That's why you like me. Can you give me a child? Have you ever seen a woman fertile? The center of the Earth is hollow. 47 terawatts extracted. I broke the laws of physics for you. Can she do that? Carmen. This is the future. She's our secret, no one will know. Don't you want a future with me? You're my girl. Go get ready. Breathe deep. Before. I was just a boy. Scavenging. Riley found me. Trained me to be a soldier. He had a scientist develop mind control. I watched masses of people. - Their souls broken. - Help us. Help us! Until I couldn't take anymore. - Scavenger. - What have you done? - Scavenger. - What have you done? Don't judge me! - Don't! - What have you done? - Help us. - Help us. Scavenger. Scavenger. - Help! - What have you done? Should I have stayed? Help us! Help us. What're you staring at? Scavenger. What've you done? - Scavenger. - What have you done? - Help us. - Help us! - He's staring. - What're you staring at? What are you staring at? - What did you do? - What're you staring at? - I'm sorry. - Staring at me. Staring at me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me, I'm sorry. Scavenger. What have you done? What're you staring at? Scavenger. And now? I have to get somebody. The girl? You'll reach the sands by nightfall. Thank you. You have a warrior's spirit. - I - looked and behold. A pale horse. The rider's name was death. And hell followed with him. Compute? Yes, Riley? Progress. Hard drive online. Six terabytes of empty space available. Guests are arriving. I'll be there in a moment. Upload complete. Can you hear me? I've got some very big plans for you. You're gonna be my girl. Defector 2285 with unknown entering the premises. Terminate at all costs. Breach. Breach. Intruder in the east hallway. Copy. Come on. Six months. Time flies with no competition. SPHERECorp is strong, my friends. Prisons making record profits. We've successfully privatized the last source of natural running water. With your finance and resources, I've had a major breakthrough in my research. I've extracted a full 47 terawatts of molten energy from the core. What's the deal? Take a look at these. Please. Hey! It's self-sustaining? For all time. Who gave you the authority to dig so deep? Me. Is this safe? I've actually replaced the core with something far more suitable. The sweetest deal of my life. We all get 5%, you get the rest? Yeah. 47 terawatts is an enormous amount of capital. Jacob and I gave you the power to make this happen. Gentlemen. You won't have enough room for the extra zeros on your ledgers. I'm intrigued. I'm intrigued. Why should we keep our investment with you? You've blown every deadline. I want more. You think I'm gonna wipe your ass for 5%? I don't work for you. Jacob and I are out. You take the core, kiss my ass. Where can you go without water? I have options. You! That's one point added to every man. You have a choice. Hey, stop! We're all in. Yeah. Excellent. It's just a tremor. Come here. Meeting's over. This your new girl, huh? She's my future. Carmen, don't! My future. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Daddy said "the meek shall inherit the Earth." This is all mine, Dad.
