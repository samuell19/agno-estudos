Broke my cane and everything, Candy. Yeah candy, Mr. Wizdom for ever, yeah. Taharqa was the son of a man named Piankhi. He was also one, of a series of Nubian rulers. To rule over both Egypt, and Nubia. For nearly a century. Before taking the throne at age 20, he sent for his mother, to witness his coronation. As many rulers before him. As king of both Nubia and Egypt, he built many temples, to honor the gods, and, to honor the memory of his ancestors. He cultivated alliances with leaders. In other countries like Phoenicia. One, campaign, that he undertook was recorded in the Bible. 2 Kings. In that story, Taharqa is called upon, by Hezekiah, who was King of Judea. Who is under attack, by Sennacherib. King Hezekiah reached out to Taharqa, for support, in this mighty campaign. Taharqa was a great, and mighty ruler. But every king, needs his queen. Hey baby? Girl, what is your problem? Look, you know, I don't do blind dates, and you know, I don't do young men. So what's up? Look, first of all, you're not doing this for yourself, you are doing it for me. And keep in mind, I am not worried about you. And also I'm doing it for Wizdom! Also honey, you must keep in mind, that the apple may not fall far from the tree! Now Come on girl, let's get inside. I really, don't do this blind date thing, I hear a lot of stories so... I get that, I've heard the stories, I'm not a killer or anything, I think. No I'm just kidding. See. I'm not even gonna ask. So... You know you can't help, but to have good manners, when you got a good woman. I know that Wiz, and, the fact that we were able to come together for the first time, that just makes me feel like we just already family. And that son of yours, I can tell he's definitely a piece of eye candy to my Beauty. Well, I don't know about that, but we're gonna try our hardest on that level, okay? Yeah, we gonna work together baby. I'm so glad to see you! Wow Our Parents. It's crazy. He was telling me about this song, "Freak In the Industry" or something, whoa.

They don't know a thing, but I tell you one thing honey, they will never ever, get to where we are today. Mm-mmh. Well, I hope so Queen, 'cause I don't want them to be freeloading off of me all day. You know what I'm saying, I hope so. By the way, can you pay for this? And last time I checked... Oh you got a real sense of humor Junior. This was a option for me. I love it. I turn around like, what you want, get away from me! What you playing over there, what you got got in your head? Oh that right. I was like I was playing with the drum. Well, we know you play the keyboard, we know. This is true. This is beautiful. You play drum for real? Well, I only did clarinet. Just drum. Mom, I didn't know Wiz so musically talented like that. Baby I didn't either, this is my first time hearing him playing the piano. Musically talented? You mean musically challenged, anybody could plug in at piano. - Junior. - No. - Seriously? - I'm just saying. Don't you say that, that's not right! You've been a play hater. Ever since you came out your mama's belly. Come on over here let's go ahead and have some dinner. Come on baby, come on lets go and eat. You telling me you can't figure out, the lighter, Junior. It takes me a second sometimes One, two, what comes after that? Yeah, just go ahead and light that blue candle. Aint this right? That's right. Yeah, it is weird, it's blue. Ms. Queen? My darling? would you mind blessing the food. Thank you. Its the best, such a wonderful day. Here you go, Junior? Made sure to tell them no swine, 'cause I don't do swine. Honey you know, that's something that we parted from many years ago. You'll be much more healthly like Mr. Wizdom and live forever! I eat good, I make sure I eat good. That's why Mr. Wizdom is good. Yes honey, that is why, you are still with us on this very day. that's what I'm saying. Junior you hear your dad, you need to take that lesson from your father son. So this is our life? Oh yeah, its a rough life. I don't know why it has to happen like this. But I'm so grateful. Well we can't choose our parents, 'cause I'd have bought different. Oh, Junior! What? Sometimes he says things, it's just so stupid. I tell ya. I just had to see though, I just had to. You two are hilarious I can't believe you did that Junior. Just one time, for the fun times. This is a real family. We got Queen, we got Beauty, and we got dummy. Anyway let's get back to this food though. Hey, Queen I saw you right there, down the street. My dad always had a weird way about him, I didn't quite understand. But, he was always working on some invention or what he calls spells, I saw nothing from it. In fact, those experiments are what drove my mama away, and left me to fend for myself. She said dad had experiments performed on him in the military that messed up his mind. She couldn't deal with it, filed for divorce, and moved to California with a white man. I didn't care anymore that she never called or cared, but it's cool, me and pops got this. I think, yeah. My dad was my man, 50 grand, and I rolled with him. Dad took care of me well but, something was just not normal about my dad. He was strange, a little mysterious, and a asshole all at the same time. Well, at least that is what I knew of him. Something tells me, that it was more to dad, that I could see. For now, I drove Mr. Wizdom around these streets. I mean, it paid for a game here and there, but something had to change. Little did I know, change was right around the corner. The Queen of Sheba, is a story that is well-known, in the Bible. That story states, the Queen of Sheba, had heard these fantastic tales, of King Solomon, in Jerusalem. She went to visit him, she presented him with gifts, peppered him with lots of questions, and once she was satisfied, she returned to her home Kingdom of Sheba. But there's another version, of the "Solomon and Sheba" story. This story is found in a book called "The Kebra Nagast". Which means the glory of the kings. In this text, the Queen of Sheba is called Makeda, she visited Solomon because she heard of his great wisdom, and generosity. She was warmly welcomed at his court, and even given a palace to stay in while she was there. Solomon also favored her with many gifts, before she left to return to her home kingdom, he threw her a great feast to honor her. She stayed in his palace overnight, and after Solomon swore that he would not pursue her. She also gave an oath, not to steal anything from Solomon. The meals served, were so spicy and Makeda awoke very thirsty, and took water to drink. Solomon reminded her of her oath, and of course she didn't protest. Solomon gave her a ring, as the last and final great gift he could give her. She left, but on her way home, she gave birth to a son, whom she named Menelik, when Menelik came of age, he went to Jerusalem, carrying the same ring, that was given to his mother by his father Solomon. Solomon and Menelik spent a lot of time together. And when Solomon tried to persuade his son to stay in Jerusalem, Menelik stated he had to return to his own kingdom. Solomon commanded his gnomes to send the firstborn sons, to accompany Menelik on his journey. But these princes were so low, to leave their homeland. And the Ark of the Covenant, which kept the spirit, of their god, they chose to steal it. And they took the Ark of the Covenant, back to Menelik's homeland. And today, it is believed, that the Ark of the Covenant, is housed in a church called The Church of Our Lady of Zion. Oh 15, so you are playing, you playing around.

He can keep on talking like that, we're gonna have to fight, I don't care who you are. Listen Junior, if you don't know the man, then you can't possibly know what you just said. This man is a war hero, and is certifiably crazy as hell! This one says, "Boom! YOU DEAD!." What? Come on Junior, 'cause your ass just wrote a check you can't cash, damn! I mean, what was he back in the day? Oh he was a sniper. Come on man. Whatever man, he tried to get you he ain't trying me. No. Time is never on my side. Here I am late again, trynna see my future bride. So baby girl, tell me how are things going between you and Junior? Mom, he's younger than me, and I was expecting him to be like, really immature, and he has, some immaturity, but, sometimes he can, you know, get real dreams and focus. Look I know you have certain expectations of men, but age doesn't always make the difference if you really care about him then honey, that's what's important. Don't let that interfere with your feelings, okay? Well I just don't want to go through the same things mom. Look baby, I'm here for you all the time, you know you can reach out to me, you can open up to me, I see it in your eyes. Beauty, there's something you're not telling me. I don't know, I just feel different about him. Is it a twinkle I see in your eyes. No. No baby, you are the daughter of a queen honey. I see a little glow on your face honey. Let me just wait and see how things go. All right well, take your time listen, from what I can see and what I can tell, he's not going anywhere. He cares about you, in fact, I strongly believe Junior is in love with you. I don't know mama. Lady take your time, and, you know, I'm gonna get ready to get out of here, I enjoyed the lunch you did good, I'm glad you had a good teacher in the kitchen. It's always a pleasure. I know Junior is on his way, I don't want to intervene in your little afternoon with your man, so, I'm gonna get out of here, but I want to thank you for lunch baby I enjoyed it. I gotta get over to my man, I got to go see the Wiz. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I mean, she was a little older, but, fine with that as long as, I can be the beholder. We all drink wine, and I mean, you think that's fine, well look, I think Beauty is fine, and with time, she'll be mine. No possessive spirit, trynna embrace that free spirit, fear is in the unknown, so, let's just let it be known, come sit with me at the throne. Oh so you a player huh? Look, I done been down that road before. I'm not going back down it. So, you can go find that trick that you texting. You got it all wrong sweetheart. I'm just texting my boy and letting him know, not to be messing with my gaming profile while I'm gone, that's all. Your gaming profile? Yeah. Look, my mama has always told me, that a man that'll play video games, will play with your heart. And look, my dad always told me, when it comes to a woman's heart, you don't never play games, be for real. Are you for real Junior? I'm not really here for none of the games, and nothing like that. When you around I'm excited about it and everything. I mean you know, I'm happy when you come around and Everything you know. You know, that's the realest thing I've heard from a man in a long time. So look, let's make a pact. That's sounds kind of serious. My heart is serious Junior. I know. And if you try this again, I will seriously... Wait a minute, you don't need to follow that, I'm not here to hurt you, I promise. I need more than that Junior, I need love, protection and faithfulness from my man. I've already had lies, deceit and unfaithfulness. So you can miss me with that. Well, all I know is right now, I just wanna give you a hug. Boo, promise me, you'll never lie to me, and you will always tell me what's on your heart. Deal. Sisters today, like to call themselves Queen. But I think, sisters should go back to Africa, for a more appropriate title. For example, Kandase is an ancient comedic word, that describes, a female ruler. This name survives today as a woman's name, Candace, spelled with a C. Women in ancient Kush, held very high status. And also played important roles in selecting who the next ruler would be. Whether a Kandake, a female ruler, or a Khari, a male ruler. One well-known female ruler, was a Kandake, was named Amanitore, she ruled during the first century of the common era. The Kandake also went into battle with their armies. Amanirenas, for example, is best remembered by the Greek, and Roman literature, for leading her Cushite troops, to engage the Romans. She also bore the title of Khari, as well as Kandake. So look, sisters need to stop using these Euro-centric terms to describe themselves, and go back to their African roots, and find the appropriate title, that reflects their strength, their beauty, and their character. I have always been fond of architecture. The lines, the curves and purposeful thought that it takes to create shelter for another, is a reminder of the grand architect. He molds and shapes you to your will. And it's up to you, who and what you decide to shelter in your own life. Everything we are was purposely made into what is our will to become. We were made in the image of the grand architect. That means I can create exactly what I want in my life. Well, I want peace, love and a joy that surpasses all knowledge. I want a strong house built on a rock, that can withstand any storm that should come my way. Until then, I am virtuously personified. I am defined, never to be declined. My life, has been refined. So, come with me, and I'll tell you why. My man, he lights up my world. When we look into each other's eyes, he's like a school age boy, and I'm his girl. That man makes me feel the fulfillment of my inner being. No restrictions, no limits, his loving is the gift that just keeps on giving. The heatedness that he brings, oh, it just makes my heart sing, from the moment we met, I get turned on by his swag, and the classy way he dressed. Sometimes I wonder, if I'm meant to be alone. Never to have that everlast, just seasons that come and go. The wind blows, and like that, off comes a dozen leaves. Each one different, just like my wishful dreams. Dreams of being kissed, until my breathing even change. Hold me so close, that I can feel your heart in my pain, sweet, gentle kisses. Rather than bitter, salty, lonely tears. But on another note, I met someone, but how could I approach it? Should I even wonder, or entertain this thought? He seems cool, smooth, in his own way. Something about the way that he smiled when I looked his way. I won't lie, I was a little iffy at first, but I thought to myself, why not, what could it hurt, I mean, you've tried everything but the app, you know why. You're scared of being hurt again, butterflies in my stomach too close to the edge, committed, not knowing what the future is gonna hold. Will he like the ones before? Sweep me off my feet, only to bang the girl, that he really wants? Man if I only knew his angle. A part of me wants to love him like a fairy tale. But it's too soon for that, isn't it? You know, if this doesn't work , I might as well see what's on the other side. Subject B has stopped at her usual spot in her free time. First she stops at her favorite coffee shop, orders her usual medium coffee, eight creams, two sugars, a coffee cake muffin handpicked for perfection that represents her immersion soft soul. Next she stops at her favorite thinking space. Open and free with a beautiful view, she finds her favorite spot under the tree of an extraordinary woman, where she appears oblivious to her surrounding as she sits under a tree and writes in her notepad her journey. I can only imagine the lines that she writes down on her notepad. What's she thinking about at this very moment? Is it Joseph, or some other that has stolen her heart, and placed it on a shelf? I wish it was me that she was walking with, and it was me that made her laugh. But you know what they say, good girls are always taken. A life without my Wiz, well, that would be like, heaven with no angels. Day by day, we drew closer, in the most fascinating way. That man, is a mystery. Who brings the definition, to mysterious. My man, he's benign. Yes, he's both gentle, and kind. And the beauty in it all, is that he's mine, all mine. And for us, there is no end, to time. And Wizdom, plus Beauty, and Queen, is everything. There go the Queen.. Hey, how you doing Queen? I'm sorry to make you rush, I just wanted to look a real queen in the face. Oh, Wizdom, its always a pleasure to look real Wizdom in his face. Man always a pleasure to see you out Dad, come on man, let's go. If you would excuse me Queen? I am at your disposal, at your earliest and most urgent convenience. Okay Wiz but, I look forward to seeing you later okay Wiz? Most definitely. All right, you go on then. Least you can do is open the door for me. Boy, I told your ass to be on time that's why you rushing. Grown folks always be rushing. Like I always say... I know if you ain't early you're late, I get it. Well, you early on the response, but you late on the learning. Calm down pops, I got my Whip on lock. The only thing you got on lock is whiplash ninja. No pops I'm crossing over on him like Iverson You sir, you don't have no pops no more. The good book says, that when you cleave to a wife, you don't have a mama or a daddy anymore. You call me Mr. Wizdom. Dad, first of all, I don't have a wife. And even if I did, you'd still be my dad. Well I already know that you have squandered, all of the greatness that I've given to you. But that's okay, Mr. Wizdom is gonna make it right. Well dad, Mr. Wizdom, 'cause I don't got a daddy anymore, I'm sure I have no clue what you talking about. Well I'm talking about driving me to the post office like you supposed to, and let Mr. Wizdom handle the rest. Mr. Wizdom is the best, you can catch them in a vest. Look, let Mr. Wizdom handle the rest. A father's job is to invest. For his child he will protest. For his child he'd probably die but I can't lie. At this age, I don't understand. I gotta do my own thing. Gotta have my own plan. Get up and move. I got stuff to prove. Not to you and you, so, look, y'all can move, I'm working on my sea legs. But with Wizdom, comes no legs, but with Wizdom, you don't need legs. Something like magic. Or maybe a scientific either way, I feel terrific. But Mr. Wizdom on the other hand, he'll look slow on his plans. In all honesty, he might just need to call the Ambulance. And I hope you find out real soon. Come on man. Junior go ahead and mail these off for me man. Pops, this is Christmas letters from two years ago. What! Well I have been on this earth for almost a century. So your ass can't tell me shit. I guess, whatever. Click goes the cane, I just wanted to get home so I can play the game. A century really? I'm surprised them letters wasn't written on scrolls. As this story unfolds, I pack Mr. Wizdom up and hope when we get there, I hope he unfolds. I know all the questions I had. Do I dare ask? Well, Mr. Wizdom, where we going next? Well we're going to this place called The Swap. Yeah, that'll be our last stop before our first stop right there. The Swap was really code, for the PTSD clinic on the South side of Chicago. I was familiar with it 'cause of my homegirl Mimi. No, Mimi don't work for them oh no. Mimi owns the clinic. We always joked about getting my pop's in, with his crazy self. But in all honesty, she was a little off too. Just a little, not as bad as my dad though. But, him and Mimi had a meeting a couple of weeks ago, I figured Mr. Wizdom was finally gonna check in. So I was kind of excited to see this. Listen man, I forgot something in the car. Go on in here, talk to nurse Dre, okay? Just talk to nurse Dre I'll be right back. Go on, go inside man. Don't worry about it, go inside. All right man. The PTSD clinic, was more like a fun house. I felt high as soon as I walked in. I think it was the helium I smelled in Mr. Wizdom's house one day. Everything looked funny, and nobody seemed to care that I was there. They were supposed to be army vets who were there to just get treated but, they all had doctor smocks on so, I didn't get it. This whole situation seemed fishy. I just wanted to leave, but Mr. Wizdom, he would make me come back in for sure. So, I was trapped by a bunch of mad doctors. All the money good, aint on the motherfucking wood. Crown. I'mma go back. Stop! Let me in! I'd like to put some more hair on her. We're going out tonight. Stop it! It's a little too quiet in here Junior. Watch this. Hey, hold it down here. Hey, y'all calm down a little bit, why y'all always like this you know, it's Wizdom, Wiz. It's Wiz y'all, Wiz. Really? Hold on aint you Wiz son? Yeah. I'm scared for you. Scared what? Where is Peaches, can you give him some medication? Yeah. Shit I am a little scared right now but... I'm scared for you. I guess, why, I don't understand. Mr. Wiz is a wizard. A wizard? Mr. Wiz is a wizard. Oh my God. Don't worry about him. Mr. Wiz is a wizard. He's a real wizard. What's dude talking about dad, he said you are a wizard. If I was a wizard boy, I'd get you some act right sense. Come on boy, we gonna be late. He is a wizard, he's a real wizard. No, I'm going first. Hey man, don't touch my hand. But you my dad, and I'm scared right now. No I don't do no funny stuff. Ever since you've been a baby, your hands smelled like shit. I smell shit. Shit! Don't worry about him, Junior. Come on man, let's get on in here. Where are we, what is this anyway? Hold on man, hey, hold on, hey, y'all, hey! What the? No, this aint... Hold on. Pops man, you set me up? What the? Tape him down good, he's strong. What the hell, no! For far too long. I watch you squander all the talents that I've given you! I am now invoking my Isaac rights. Isaac rights, hold on! Playing around, playing a damn game. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. This aint... You could have just whipped me dude like why? This is ridiculous, I mean... Quiet! Was it the drink, the one you paid for man, it was just one drink. Stop struggling. Listen, for far too long, you have squandered everything. I have waited, and I'm weighted. Now, it is time. Your body belongs to mine. Wait, what's that, hold on. Be still. Hold still. What is that, wait. Now son, I did it because I love you. Hey, Mr. Wizdom, now is gonna make it right. My life is better than yours. My credit is better than yours, I got a house, I got a car, I got money, what you got, nothing. So now, is the time to make it right. It's okay son, don't worry about it. Mr. Wizdom is gonna make it right. Go to Sleep. Business is done, let's do the next process. Get the body prepared. So this is the part when I die. It was soft and peaceful at first, like floating in a warm pool of water. And then I felt incredible pain. What came next, I can't quite explain. What the hell? What happened, what the hell? What the hell man? Why am I looking at myself, looking at myself, man, dad, you stole my damn body! Calm down son! Calm down man, what are you talking about? Man, first mom left me, now you gonna take my damn body, man! I cannot believe you man! Goddammit, look at this, look at my body! It's old! My hands, I can't believe this man. This wasn't your property. This wasn't your body man! This is my body, give it back to me. Give it back to me man, give it back to me dad! You can't do this man, give me back my body man! Well, I can't do it, and I've already done it. So, you might as well just calm down. Jesus Christ, we nearly missed that delivery, man! I can't believe this man. So, what's the plan now man, where are we supposed to be going? Gonna take you to get your threads right. Threads right? Yeah. Whatever man. Going around dressed like this? I had to rent a car, 'cause that little rust bucket you was driving, was not gonna do it for today. Who cares about a damn car? I can't believe this, man! How did you even do this? Can't tell you all that now, can't tell you all of that. Too much info will ruin a good body Oh man, this thing got the good brakes. This has to be illegal. It would be if they knew about it. But they don't know about it so... Can't get away with this dad. It's a lot of thing I wish I couldn't get away with, but, this is the best one yet. It's gotta be the best plan I've came up with. For sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. Is that right dad? Right dad? I'm still your father, let's go. No, I'm your father now. You put me in a father's body. Yeah, but the thing about a father's body is it grows old sometimes. The only reason you can get me now is 'cause I'm stuck in the car. But you know, whatever. At least it's spacious this time. Dad, you gonna pay for this dad. I can't believe this, I can't even see. I've been there for all of them years. All of these years. Don't you wear glasses? I did. Where are they man? I don't know, I don't wear them anymore. Oh man. Wizdom had taken my body, like that movie I had studied called "The Body Snatchers". As he told me the story, I wondered why he thought he was doing me a favor. I gotta go sleep man. Wake me up when we get there. How long does it take to get there? You got a long journey ahead of you. Sit back and relax, that's all you gotta do. He said he was going to point my life in the right direction. But I was just thinking he wanted to get his rocks off You know, do all the things he couldn't do. But, the Wizdom has done everything. So that didn't make sense. How did he do this, was my first question. Why, was my second. And my third was even more terrifying. What is he gonna do next? Oh yeah! Hurry up boy, we need to get in here to handle the business Dad? What? My mind said run, but every step I take, I go backwards. That's okay son, you gonna have to get your sea legs. That's all. Dad, it feel like, I don't got no legs. Come on man, let's go. All right dad. It was my fault that junior, was in this mess. So it was my responsibility to get it fixed, and show him what it was all about. So now, I had the task of showing this similaic sucker, the finer art of picking a suit. But you just can't get any suit. You gotta get the look you love, if you wanna do it right. Take one off the rack, get it sliced up in the back, that's what I always do. Now you talking the finer arts of haberdashery. I tell my boys to get in here all the time. I also tell them they better had they money right, and they game tight. 'Cause my man Billy, he own the store. And he'll take all the money in your pocket. Look at him now, lurking. He trying to sell something. My man Billy. Wiz, man, I haven't seen you in a minute. How you been Slick? Man, It's good to see you too bro, what is it, been a long time? Bro? How you been man, I ain't seen you in so long, you're the site for sore eyes man. Yeah. Dad have been hanging around me too long sir. Wiz, this is your son? Yeah, this is my son, Junior. Smooth, I need you to cut me a one off, and square me up Jake. Now you're talking my language Young Blood. Let me take you to the back. So now I need to school, all y'all young cats, on the one-off. So you get a suit off the rack. And you take it to the back to my man, Mack, get it customized. You change something here, you changed something there. Get that bad boy, Gensue Knifed to your body. Yeah, that's the only way to roll. I gotta look fresh tonight. I got a date with Beauty yeah son's girlfriend, but I'm technically in his body. Lord knows Queen, will kill me. You gon make me late, I'm telling you. You the one that got me into this dad. Yeah, that's the problem. That's why me being late is important. It's kind of tight. Well deal with it. I can feel it right now. This body is definitely a virgin body. This body aint never had sex. So I'm gon mess with it even though I am dry as a cactus. But, I definitely ain't gonna mess this up well now. Hey man, I'm feeling the chain man, I see you learn something, and I don't walk like that. Cane, foot. Jesus Christ Hey dad, where are we going to next man? We going to this little place I like to call, The Pasture. where all the cool chicks go to graze. The Pasture, sounded like a farm with animals. But I had no choice but to follow Wizdom blindly. Besides, this was the most I had ever hung out with my father since I was a kid. I have to admit, he was kind of cool. And seeing him happy in my body, it kind of made me happy in a weird kind of way. It's all right son! You'll be all right, forget it. I see you good right now... Oh, I feel better than I ever felt before. You Just don't know. Man look, I think y'all should drink. What did you try man, what's the secret? I can't tell you the full secret right now, 'cause you know, it's too much going on. Write it down to me. Look at you now. Look at him, look. You can't do us old guys like that man. What, he's a young man, mentally. You know and kind of be in a more perspective way, you wanna go on up this you and try to you know, build your morality up a little bit. and try to encourage you with something, you know? 'Cause you've been looking a little sad there a little out of it, look down, you know what I mean man? We trynna lift you up a little bit. What is it gonna take for us to lift you up? Whatever don't touch me. See, you got just learn to say hey you know you can't be, you know. I don't know what you're saying bro you better get glad cause you gotta get glad, 'cause you gotta take out the trash today still. I don't think you encourage him to be a little out on the happy side. You know what I mean? He's just still in that mood. Junior what's up with you? You gotta have a reason man, not a season. No, he don't know what season it is. He don't know about it I'm sorry. Well... You gonna think the proof is in the pudding? Trust me he don't know. He really don't know. Where you been man, what happened? There gotta be a story. Where you going? Son? I can catch him. Yeah you bet. Yeah, I've been hard on Junior, but motivation, and critical thinking is what young folk need. And what's more motivating, than losing your body to an old man. Now look man, I invited Queen, and I told her to bring her daughter Beauty. Beauty? Yeah. Man, she dope dad. Wait, you looking at the wrong woman. Okay, your body belongs to Queen tonight all right? So now, I gotta pretend like I'm Junior. Boy, that's gonna be a hard one. I just told this boy two seconds ago, his body belonged to Queen and he's still going for Beauty? See, that's what's wrong with young folk. Memory two second long 'cause they smoked too much weed. But now, I need to concentrate on Beauty. Yeah, she get it from her momma so I'mma be gentle. Ooh, look at these two handsome gentlemen right here, y'all look hot! Mom, why haven't you invited us out before now? Man, how could you get better than a Queen and a Beauty in the same place. Yeah, I guess I won't have to kill him. I'll be back mommy. All right honey, have fun! Oh hell naw, she wanna take a real player to the back of the club? Like I used to tell her, I aint no player. I'm for real, and you trynna take me to the back of the club? I know what happened back there, and it ain't popping no bottles of bubb. but I know the Queen gonna leave me if she ever find this out. So maybe just a kiss. Yeah, a little rub on the booty, that's all I need. Much a long time, so, you know, and it's almost like, you got this, also like my mommas era, but, you want a young body you know? And for the first time, I feel like, I can love again. Yeah, I'm definitely not listening right now. You know, it's almost like every time I turn around, you've been doing something more to prove to me that you're ready for this relationship. And, how do you feel about it? Yeah, got too much on my mind to think right now. Junior! Hmm? What you on man? See, this is what I been talking about, I can't even... When all else fails, kiss em'. So sweet. You know what, come on. Now, I'm looking at your booty. It was like, I was a part of some weird dream. I was this young man, with old parts. And my dad was having more fun in my body than I had ever had. I wanted to join the fun but, my knees felt like they were super-glued together. I wanted to snap my fingers and clap my hands to the beat, but my hands hurt. Probably from arthritis. Baby I was talking about that third leg. - You ready baby? - Lets go. Yeah. Best time I've had in a long time. What you hearing Ma? AFTER PARTY! Yeah. Together like this, and just to have the youngins alone, they really brought back some great Memories... I don't know what they're talking about. That's my baby girl. She wore Junior out tonight. I just knew it. Man, I tell you what. It was the best time ever. I Know. Got you out there with the third leg going tonight, the crazy leg was going on tonight. Yes I cant believe I was doing that. You can learn something from your father young man. He needs a third leg. Y'all don't even know it, definitely. Really? Mm-hmm, at this point in age yeah. Hey cat daddy why don't you and I go find some shade. Okay but, can I talk to my son for a moment. Okay. - Just for a bit. - All right but hurry back. I will. Come on man. Okay, coming back? I apologize. I was just getting comfortable. Beauty is your name and getting back, in less than a minute, is about to be my game! I hope it aint about us girls. Dad, man, I think Queen, wants to have sex. Listen man, I can't talk to women like you do. Listen son, women are like school teachers. Listen, take notes, raise your hand, get the correct answer, you gonna get the A! He was really nice, and funny. It was, they are so entertaining. Yes! And that place tonight was beautiful. I know. Dad, I'm trynna be serious man, like what do I do? I don't know what to do. Look, question is what you don't do. Look man, Queen, do everything. I mean she like that song... Which song dad? You know, "Freaks Of". You know it's the first time, Wiz is entertaining in that club? Well, maybe he's waiting for a special occasion. I guess so, well I'm glad it was with us. Yes, my darling, can't get any better than us, can they? Beauty and... I definitely Beautiful. Freaks of the... No Dad, what you mean freaks? Dad? Its a good song, you gonna have to check it out. Anyways, look, look forget all that. Just raise your hand man. That's all you can do pay attention, listen. Pay attention. Dad, and if I don't know the answer? Just relax, okay, just relax. Relax, look at my body, you took my body from me! What I'm I supposed to do I don't even know if it works. It works, it definitely works. It's a little tricky sometimes, but it works. Tricky? Yeah. Just, look. I see I had to break out some of my, special pills. All right. What's this? Well it's for the, trickiness. It's your duty to please that booty. Now get in there. I Can't believe, I had to motivate this boy into a prime piece of real estate. All right my man, you got everything you need right now? Yeah, come on you ready? Yeah, I felt bad, but she was going home with my body. It was nice seeing you again Queen, all right you have good one. - Good night Beauty. - yes. - Good night y'all. - Thank you. Goodnight Wiz. See you later. Finally. I'm about to have sex soon as I close this door. When you know what you doing, why waste time? You know what you doing to me Junior? Junior? I know! The thing about a woman, when you make love to her mind first, the body come along. Babe, what are you doing come on, I've been waiting for you. Give me just, one second I forgot something. Just one second. Wiz don't keep me waiting. One second. Pops said, Queen had that good-good. It couldn't have been good for his health, but, all I know, is I hadn't had good-good, or bad-bad. If sex was driving, I didn't have a license yet. And I had a old school Rolls-Royce. Waiting for me in the other room. To make matters worse, I had this old body, I didn't even know how to use yet. Oh well, when in Rome, do as Mr. Wizdom do. I'm about to show you what's going down. Yes babe! Take it OFF! I need some singles honey! Ill be throwing dollars. That's my Wiz right there. One mans show in the house. Yes, I can't wait for this one Wiz. Only thing I can remember, is what I saw on TV. Mr. Wizdom was an entertainer, so I had to have something in me. It's getting hot in here. One thing Mr. Wizdom always told me, was to come prepared for the expected, and the unexpected. Baby! you can't stop now! Especially the unexpected. Wiz! I don't know what you... You need some help honey? You need some help. What! What? Where the scissors man? He didn't say anything about scissors. Queen, can you just hold me? Of course baby. I'm sorry. It's okay baby, there'll be other times I understand. I'm just not feeling myself. It's gonna be okay, you're still my Wiz. My pops said I was always late, sure wasn't early to this one. I didn't want Queen to wake up in a lumberyard. Please don't let me wake this woman up. Don't wake up. I had to do something fast, let me call dad. Hello? Dad, I think, something wrong with my johnson. What in the world are you talking about son? Its 4:00 am in the morning. It won't go down I think I need to see a doctor. You don't need a doctor son. No, dad, my johnson won't go down. Just run some cold water on it, and take some Tussin. Dad! Mr. Wizdom said, cold water and Tussin. Okay, I don't have no Tussin but, cold water, let's see what that do. Naw, the water didn't work. Wiz? Okay, I'll be there in a minute. Baby what are you doing? So, I'm in somebody else's body. Here I come. And I'm about to lose my virginity? I think. OOOH! Wiz BABY! I've been waiting a long time for this. Come to mama! Queen did have that good-good, a type of good that make a brother wanna change his life. So I decided to, take Mr. WiZdom up on this trading thing he was talking about, and not bodies. I'm talking stocks, options, iron condors, strangle swaps, I'm talking a whole world that, we ain't taught in school. I'm talking about gettin white folks money, financial literacy. It's time to cash in. It was like second nature to me. I knew when the stock was going up, and when it was going down! I cashed in on a couple of licks by the time me and dad was done, we cleared over two mil. I was a Wiz kid after all. It's Funny how responsibility works. When you're motivated, it comes a lot faster. I was living in an American dream, that I didn't even know existed. I Kept myself in the dark, this whole time. And it took switching bodies to realize it. So Mr. Wizdom did teach me a lesson. Not to take for granted, the knowledge that is readily available. I was a believer now. and the world, was my oyster. What's up dad? Sit down for a minute son, I need to rap to you. What's going on man, you look like you mad sad. We winning dad, you look like somebody dying. Look son, in the Bible, Isaac's dad took him, and bounded him to an altar, for a sacrifice to God. He took him, and he put them there but, God didn't let that happen. He put a little ram in a bush for him. So, in order for us to change back son, must be a sacrifice. So, okay dad, let's buy a ram, make that happen. No boy, I am the ram, Jesus! What, no! yeah No dad, why? I'll be clear soon son, I'll be clear soon. Dad. I'm here son. I ain't gone nowhere yet. Why would you do this? You knew you was gonna die, why would you do this? Son, the ultimate sacrifice, is for a father, to give his life for his kids. Dad! Son, I love you, I'm proud of you, I did this, so you can live life more abundantly. I did this for you. Son, I want you to be better than me. You have all my talent. You have all my ability, and you have all my intelligence. So now son, it is your time, to be, Mr. Wizdom. Dad, no, dad. DAD! DAD! Yeah that's right son, and don't mess with my Queen either. What? Don't mess with my Queen. Dad, you are like that, dad come on now, come on! ♪ I'll see you in the upper room ♪ ♪ In the upper room ♪ No, dad. Junior, what's the emergency, Junior? Oh my God! When I woke up, he was laying here. Oh my God. You can't leave me like this. This can't be happening. Wiz once took me, to what he called his bridge. He said that when we cross, we consciously make a decision to change something in our lives. Well change happened. Whether I chose to cross or not. It's funny how the only thing consistent, in this world is change. And it's up to you, how you adapt. For me, a life of travel, is how I am going to adapt. There's so much I haven't seen, and now it's the perfect time. I am virtuously personified, even in pain, for when I am weak, He is strong. I am supplied with everything I need, even in an incredible loss. This is joy, that surpasses all knowledge in action. The beauty and joy is that, it's not dependent upon emotions. It stands alone as a free gift, for those that ask and can, get you through any storm. This is definitely a storm. And I stand with joy, as a house on a rock. So until we meet again my King, I am for forever yours. My job, is to be there for my man. When he's up, and when he's down. I'm there to support and inspire. A strong woman understands, that she holds the power, in her tongue, as well as her actions, to change the life of those around her. My grandmother used to say, that death brings life. I felt a life in me, that told me that my dreams would be answered. A family of my own, maybe triplets, funny thing about being truly loved and care for, it brings out a new level of a woman, Blossoming your relationship to a whole new level. I am now, ready to be, Mrs. Wizdom. Mr Wizdom had become my best friend almost overnight. I never knew him until I became him. And as bad as the truth may seem, he taught me how to be a man, and take up responsibility as a new focus. I didn't have thoughts of games anymore, I had thoughts of taking care of my family. Right now, my family is Beauty and everything that is her. I love you so much son, you are now ready to become Mr. Wizdom. That's what pops meant when he said, cleave to a wife. My focus was now her, and it was my responsibility, to make sure that our family's needs are taken care of. This was way more fun than playing a video game anyway. I was playing the game of life, and I was for real. Now, it's time to go make my own kingdom. What is this? Hey mom? Look, Wiz would you please go get your father's cane for me? Sure, no problem, I'll be right back. So mom, why you got all these clothes for vacation? I'm scared for you. Girl, I plan on wearing, everything in my closet while I'm on vacation. Don't be out here trynna... Okay? Look, you know I'm fine. I know, and I get it from my momma. Yes you do, girl! All right, well, just be safe and, call me when you get there please? Let me know that you made it safe? Look, I don't need to check in with anybody, I am a fully grown woman. Look, I don't even have a GPS, okay, but, I'll let you know when I get there, okay? - Okay mom. - All right. - Just be safe. - I will. I don't know where it's at, is not where I left it at. - What? - That's strange. I'll just ship it to wherever you at, okay mom? All right let me help you with these bags real quick. Just please let me know, soon as you find it, okay? I know mom. All right, don't worry about it, honey, 'cause I'm still gonna get my groove on all right? Wiz would've wanted it that way wouldn't he? Yes he would. - Okay. - I love you mom. I love you. - Be safe. - I will. You two better hurry up and get to work, okay? Don't blame me. Drive safe mom. I will. I have found you Mr. Wizdom. I have also found your book of spells. That means that now I, am a wizard. Don't worry Wiz, I'll bring you back to life. Every villain needs his hero. Will you be my hero Mr. Wizdom? Good, 'cause I'll be your villain. Young blood, let me take you to the back. Now you're talking my language young blood let me take you to the back. You in a young body, you know! Hey, hold it down here, hold it down. Cut. Tony! Man!
