CAIRO SIX SEVEN EIGHT INSPIRED BY REAL STORIES You ask about women They are simply mad. Women are all the same They are simply mad Lady or commoner They are simply mad You ask about women Different degrees but at the end, Women are just mad - We are closing down now. It's 4 pm. - I've been waiting for an hour! And I've been here for 8 hours. Why are you in a hurry? You don't have a husband or kids to look after. I'm leaving early to find myself a husband. - 6th of October City? - How much are you paying? 10 pounds. 6th of October City? 10 pounds. Move on, madam. Move on inside the bus. Are you stuck to the stairs? Move to the inside! The bus is empty. Repeat after me, Rasha. Why? Where? What? How? Wait a sec. Leave this on. Three. One, two, three. Classes are on Fridays at 7pm. And it is for free. Daddy is home! Daddy is home! Hello, sweethearts. Got you gum, princess. And here are your cookies son. What do you think? - You shaved? - Yes. Looks good? - Button up. It's cold. - Cold? Onions? Who eats onions at bedtime? Listen. What? Fayza. Wake up. I miss you. - I'm too tired. I can't. - What do you mean you're tired? I mean I'm too tired to do what you want me to do. What's wrong with you? You're always tired or not up to it! Do I smell bad? I just showered. - Go to sleep, Adel. - I'm not sleeping until you tell me! - Nothing. Nothing at all. - Great! You don't need to carry weapons to defend yourself. Many women carry self defense but still can't defend themselves. Defending oneself is a decision. "If anyone lays his hand on me, I'll cut it off. I won't shut up." Look him straight in the eye. He'll fear you. He targets weak women... who don't speak out, the ones who keep silent. I've told you everything. I have one request, A tough one. There's a blank sheet of paper in front of you. I'll ask you three questions. Please answer them honestly. Have you been sexually harassed? How many times? How did you react? Please go ahead. Thank you. Fayza. It is your fifth week here and it is a one day course. All your answers are: "No". Why do you come? - Like everyone else. - Exactly like everyone else! They all say "no"! Not one of them was sexually harassed. Why do you come here? To watch me? If you go to a doctor and can't tell him you have a stomach ache... he won't be able to help you. - Stomach aches aren't shameful. - And sexual harassment is not shameful. Only the haresser has reason for shame. Not you. Express yourself. You don't have to write it down. Say: I was sexually harassed". No I wasn't. I'm only here to learn self defense. You can defend yourself with this pin. Yes, with a pin. Don't come back. I have nothing to teach you. Let's go, dad. The money's on the table. There'll be 40 pounds left after you pay the rent. - What about our school fees? - Tell them next week. Let's go, kids. Here you go. Next! Sign here. Here you go. - What's this? - Your salary, madam. - Where's the rest? - That's after deductions. - I need my full payment. - That's your payment. Next! - Sign here. - She needs to pay the school fees. What can I do for her? She's always late for work. This is government work. Next! Sign here. Next! Sign here. Are you mad? You pricked me with that pin! Are you out of your mind? Next time I'll cut your hand off! - Did you use that pin on him? - I did. Next time I'll use it to tear his eyes out. What could I have done to her? We're all packed in this bus! - Why did you prick him? - She's crazy! - Tell us. Why did you prick him? - I'm telling you she's crazy, crazy! A YEAR BEFORE I love the red. Just want a piece. - Where are you? - I'm jogging on the street. I told you a million times to use the treadmill at home. Why not lock me up at home. Brilliant idea. I'd have you all to myself. - Hang up. You are pissing me off. - Seba. - What? - I love you. Will you marry me? Wish I could, but I'm already married to a mad man. He loves football more than his wife. I love you both equally. Bye then. Slowly! We have to catch the first second of the game. Go Egypt! You have to cheer harder, you are a true Egyptian. - Is this good? - Too weak. Show your Egyptian strength. I'll be very disappointed if we lose after all the effort I'm making. I'd kill myself if we lost. I have good news for you in case we lose. Nothing can make me happy if we lose. Everyone here will be upset if we lose. You won't be upset. - Seba! - Sherif! Why won't you come home? Too much work. - And why aren't you answering my calls? - I don't answer anyone's calls. I'm your wife, I'm not just anyone. I wish you'd come back home. - I need you. - I can't, Seba. Every time I see you I remember what they did to you. I need time. You're the one who needs time? You can't imagine what I'm going through. I can't understand how you did not think of... - what I am going through. - I don't want to think! Go home. Go home. - Where are you going? - To report the incident. - Report what? - What happened to me! - Whom are you going to report? - I don't know! Nobody raped you. When someone touches you against your will, it's not a violation? Seba, if you report it, it will be filed away. Your father's position cannot allow for such a scandal. Sweetheart, you just need some rest. Don't worry about Sherif. When he finds out you're pregnant... - everything will be back to normal. - I don't want to tell him! - If anyone tells him, I'll kill myself! - Calm down, no one will tell him. - I don't want to bear his child. - It's OK. No one will tell him. In one day, women can learn to defend themselves? I don't teach violent sports nor how to hit a harasser. I work on women's psychological make-up. She doesn't need a man's protection. - All in one day? - It can be explained in a minute. The real problem is with implementation. - Where do you teach this course? - Friday at Sawy Cultural Center, 7 pm. And it's for free. We now come to the end of our program... Daddy is home! What do you want, Sherif? - I called you several times. - I will answer when I have the time. - But you never call back. - What do you want? - I need some documents. - Get to the point. Why are you here? - I want you, Seba. - How is that possible? You can't even look me in the face it makes you want to vomit. Don't say that. I am the one who has a problem. - I told you I needed time. - And I needed you. That was then. This would have been tough for any man. - I wanted to protect you. - I can now protect myself. You're too late. I don't want you, ever. Not true. If it were true, you would've asked for divorce. Seba! Excuse me. Do you have more of the dancing couples? I stopped making them. If you don't find anything, go shop elsewhere. I'm telling you she's crazy. Crazy! ONE MONTH EARLIER I'm getting married and searching for a flat. I found the best newspaper ad. Prices at 2 million pounds for living room and bedroom. Nothing else. And as a citizen with that kind of money and much more... I felt blessed and thanked the Lord... for having found such an inexpensive flat. People with only 1.5 or 1.25 million. How can they possibly manage? Is anyone here engaged? You ain't getting married, buddy. May God help you. Thank you. I now leave you with Nelly... the first female stand-up comedian in Egypt. She's my fianc?e, she's not interesting, cool nor funny. Try to be kind to her. Try to laugh at her jokes the poor soul. A folded twenty pound note will make her happy. Appreciate it. Good evening. My name is Nelly... and everyone have to crack Nelly, the television star clich?. I'm 22 years old and I admit it. Most girls guard their age, as a Military Secret. When I tell my colleagues I'm doing stand-up comedy, they make fun of me. "The jokes' girl is here. Jokes' girl is gone." And the accompanying music... Of course not. The problem is with the material. The audience only laughs at things they relate to. - You have the advantage of being a girl. - You're awesome, man! - Thanks. - You really rock. You're a girl and can talk about girls' stuff. I talked about the age thing. Girls keep that a secret. Dig deeper, Nelly. - Maybe I'm just not funny. - No! Or I wouldn't have fallen for you. You're real and crazy. Your only problem is you have to talk about girls' stuff. Like what do girls like about guys. What's there to like? I'm just being kind to you. Get in the car. If you're so smart, why are you like a sitting duck on stage? I'm too big for this car. Good afternoon. I'm Nelly Roushdy, from Circle Discount Solutions. Allow me 5 minutes to tell you the benefits of our discount card. - Are you a friend of Sarah Sami? - I don't know her. But your voice is familiar. Where do you live? Believe me, sir, I don't know you. - Just tell me where do you live. - Nasr City. I have a Mini Cooper and I can pick you up from... This is the last time you hang up on a customer. - He was hitting on me. - Don't play along. Be diplomatic. Can't you be more diplomatic? - Make him hang up. - It doesn't work! It works. It works for all the other girls? OK. Fine. Hello. Hey, mum. - Hey, dear. Where are you now? - I'm there. I see you now. Tell Omarto come up. - She says come up. - I'd love to but I'm too tired. - He's not coming. - Tomorrow then. - You don't sound well, dear. - Nothing much. Just tired from work. Cross the street carefully. Waiting for you, dear. Nelly! Nelly! You animal! You animal! Stop! Get out! Stop, you animal! Are you okay? You son of a bitch! You shit! Please sir, stop. Stop! You are in a police station, not on the street. - Who are you? - I'm her fianc?. We want to file a report right now. - I'm filing a report, aren't I? - So why are they waiting? Calm down. I'm doing it now. Patience You see this? An injury that needs over 21 days treatment. - The doctor understands me. - I'm a professor, not a Medical Doctor. OK, madam. I'm writing a solid assault report. I'm trying to get you justice. - Addition and sexual harassment. - Harassment? I'm going to destroy him. I want to file a report for what I've been telling you for the past hour! Why? The penalty for assault is more severe. Or do we want a scandal, Dr? It's not my scandal! It's non of your damn business. Just do what she's asking! - Calm down, Omar. - None of my business. - No more reports. - You are gonna do it, like it or not! This is not a main police station. To file a complaint, an officer has to be present. - And there's no officer here. - Didn't you say you're filing a report? I too have a daughter. I want to save your future wife's reputation. - Is that so? - Yes. Because you are like my daughter. And for your sensible mother's sake... If you want an assault report, I'll do it for you. But if you want that other report, then take... What's your name? Ramadan. Ramadan to the main police precinct. Today's topic is highly controversial. Nelly Roushdy is the first girl to file a sexual harassment lawsuit in Egypt. Nelly, did you know you were the first woman to report sexual harassment? No, I thought that many Egyptian women had done so. You are the first one to sue for sexual harassment in Egypt. Our first caller is Bossaina. Go ahead, Bossaina. I really admire you and wish we were all as courageous as you are. I didn't do anything extraordinary. This is what should be done. - It's difficult. - Bossaina, it's not difficult but... My name is not Bossaina. She's ashamed to say her name. We have another caller. Ahmed, from Giza, go ahead. I feel like we are in another country. Everybody's talking harassment? We have sisters and women all around. It doesn't happen to them. This young lady was probably wearing something provocative. Sr. Ahmed, I was wearing this very same outfit. Except for the jacket, cause it got torn. - Anything wrong with my outfit? - Not at all. - Anything provocative? - None. I wore it today 'cause I knew someone would make this comment. As for your sisters, they too are exposed to what happened to me... but they don't tell 'cause they know what you will say. Doesn't this girl have a family that can tell her what to say? Nelly. We agreed with yourfather-in-laws to drop the case next hearing. What? I can't do that. Did you see what happened on the show? Everyone was against you. Some callers were supportive. Only one. The rest were against you. - It's for your best interest. - My best interest? It doesn't matter what you did. What matters is your reputation. Tell her what people were saying at the office. That you must be part of a conspiracy to ruin Egypt's reputation. Good thing they didn't say she was overthrowing the government. I chose between shutting up ortainting Egypt's reputation? Nelly, if your reputation is ruined it will ruin Omar's. We won't allow that. She'll drop the lawsuit. - Excuse me. - Finish your food. I'm full. Thank you. - I won't drop the lawsuit. - I don't want you to. Good, 'cause I won't. - You like the view? - The balcony is the nicest thing here. I'll wrap it up for you when you leave. You want to laugh now. - I'm not dropping the lawsuit. - I don't want you to drop it... but if it will make my parents stand against our marriage then screw it. - There's no other option? - It's like when I took the bankjob. I never asked you to work at a bank. I told you continue with stand-up comedy... Take an acting course. Do what you love. Would your parents approve of me without a steady job? Of course not. That's why I took a bankjob I hate. Just so that we can be together. If I drop this lawsuit, I'll hate you all. I'll hate myself. You know what's the best part of my day? Waking up. You know why? I wearthe suit I hate, the ridiculous tie and uncomfortable shoes. I hate the people who work at the bank and every minute I spend there... but it's all for you, so that we can be together. I could've complained and said the same things you said about hating your life... but I love you and I want us to be together. Let's go back inside. - Why did you prick him? - I'm telling you she's crazy! Where are you going, babe? Show us what you are hiding. The best part of you is right here, it's your sweet... What's wrong, Fayza? What happened? - Are you sure no one saw you? - I don't know. I didn't see anyone. - What's this sound? - The seat belt alarm. Put it on. - I'm sorry, I'm a nervous wreck. - Don't worry. We'll go to my place. No! I want to go home. Take me home. You can't go home looking like this. Come, Fayza. Put this on. - What's this? - Just to cover up. - Does it show? - No. Nothing shows. Sit down. I don't know how I did this. Should I turn myself in? Fayza, you came to me 'cause you know I won't condemn what you did. - So did I do the right thing? - I really don't know. All I know is that what happens to you daily is wrong. - How do you feel? - Honestly? I feel like I got justice. - Why are you standing like this? - You didn't pay the school fees. I won't get paid for another two weeks. Find someone who borrowed from you before. I never lent money to anyone. Never had money to lend. So the kids will continue being punished? Why do they punish us? You did not pay. - Go speak to the school principle. - You were there and didn't speak to him? - What would I say? - Deal with it. Aren't you the man? I am the man! Give me the shirt. What do you expect of me? I'm juggling two jobs, and have no time for myself. I stopped going to the caf? and quit smoking to save money. What else do you want? Then you go spend the money we save on taxis! Why? Who the hell do you think you are? Go on the bus like everyone else. Next week, I'm going to transfer the kids to a public school. - We can't afford these fees. - Daddy, please don't! Fine, Adel. I'll take the bus. I'm sorry, I have to close down now. I can't believe this. This time, it wasn't a reaction. You knew what you were doing. - You must be... - Crazy, right? No. Then what do you mean? Every day, I take the bus, every day shit happens to me. Every single day. You expect me to be sane? They deserve what they get. They deserve what they get. If he knew someone did this to his sister, daughter or wife... he would say it is well deserved. Didn't you tell me to defend myself? Now I'm defending myself like hell! So don't they deserve to be punished? Yes, they do! They deserve it. Big Boss, good morning. Buses? Two buses? Where? - OK, sir. I'll go there right now. - Go where? It's my wife, she's a little tired. - Tired? I'm giving birth. - Bye, sir. Calm down, Magda. They say delivering a girl is always more difficult. No one in our family has girls. Just take me to hospital, for God's sake! Calm down. - Where did he go? - I don't know. Sir! All these buses! One matchstick, we'll get rid of them and all their shit. They carry the entire population, and they aren't enough for everybody. - You want to set the country on fire? - I didn't mean that, sir. - Where did you go man? - Sorry, sir. - Here you go. - Is this the bus? Yes, sir. - Where is it? - Right here, sir. - Is this the bloodstain? - Yes, sir. Looks like a pocket knives' scuffle. - The victim was a bureaucrat. - So why is the ministry on high alert? The two were stabbed in the same place, same way. Where? What? - I need an informant on every bus. - Do you know how many buses there are? No, but I know how many informants there are in Egypt. Come in. Excuse me, the officer needs to question the patient. - What happened, Nasr? - I don't know sir. I was on the bus... suddenly I felt the pain and fell to the floor. Don't over do it. The doctor says it's a superficial wound. Get yourself together and sit up. - Did you see who hit you? - How could I? The bus was packed, you can't tell whose foot or hand you see. - Do you fight often? - Never. No way! We're all at wits ends nowadays. Are you going out with a girl with a jealous brother out to get you? - No girl would want me. - What's your job? - Don't have one and I'm penniless. - So where were you heading on the bus? Got bored of staying at home and went out for some fresh air. - Fresh air on a bus? - It's better than staying at home. Do you know that some other guy was hit in the same way as you were? - Is that a coincidence? - I honestly don't know. Were you on the bus to make a grab? - Grab? - Grab ass... women. Swear to God I didn't. I get stabbed and you accuse me. It's not fair. I'm not sentencing you to death. Do you know you're damned for what you are doing? Angels curse women who reject their husbands. What does that mean, mum? Go inside, Rasha. - Rejection is saying "no" all the time. - No. Rejection is saying 'no' when one's able to say 'yes'. She's trying, but just can't. Why? Tell me what's wrong. - Nothing. - Nothing? Am I supposed to guess? What's wrong with you? Why AM I married to you? - Did you marry me for that? - Yes, I married you for that! Do you think I married you to play backgammon with you? May God make you as miserable as you make me! I'll call you later. My mother-in-law? Sorry. I knew it was a false alarm. Yes, I've been called in for work. Call you back? Bye. - Here. - Thank you. Why were you, out of all the people on the bus, sir... - Maher, sir. - Maher. I swear I don't know. Fate. His car broke down, and he had to take the bus. - Thank God, he's okay. - Thank God. Madame, step out for a second, please. What's this? - A lemon. - Really? I thought it was a watermelon. What was this lemon doing in your pocket? Your pocket had a cold? I don't know. Maybe I forgot it there when I went shopping for food. - Or were you doing the lemon test? - What? You never heard of it? You put the lemon in your pocket and squeeze yourself against a woman. If she doesn't speak out, you go for the grab. If she gives you a dirty look, you say. "I forgot this lemon in my pocket ". I never heard of this before. Look here, Maher. I don't care about the sexual harassment... as long as I don't have a complaint. All I need to know were you stabbed for this reason. Madame! Ramzi! - Do you have the keys to the car? - Yes, sir. In my handbag. Give them to me, because we need to check it out... and make sure it had broken down. We'll see. Did you find the keys, madame? It's OK. The car broke down. Hope you have insurance. Let's go, Ramzi. - This guy is targeting harassers? - Or this gal. NEWS OF THE STABBINGS What's up with the men today? So newspapers know of news before it happens? Ramzi, I'll tell you what we'll do... Ask in all the police stations and hospitals... about similar cases. Just a sec. I'm on the phone, I can't hear him. None of your business. Eat! Listen to me, Ramzi. Look for similar cases everywhere. One person will have seen who does this. Call me when anything comes up. Bye. Enough olives. What's up? Why the long face? When you have the baby, I'll be there. - You were never there. - I know you well enough. What's really bothering you? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Don't fool around with me, I'm a police detective. What's wrong? I did a sonography at the hospital today. Why didn't you say so? So you now know you're expecting a boy. I knew it! I so wanted to have a girl. - Whatever God gives us is a blessing. - Thank God. - Why are you interrogating me, sir? - I'm not interrogating. Don't you teach women how to defend themselves and hurt men? I just want to know if any of the students were acting weird. I gave that class on television... So maybe you should suspect all women in Egypt. Right. I promise to check out my wife when I get home. And my mum. Hey you! Lady in veil. Come here. Do you work here? She's an employee from the municipal registry. Sometimes we ask them to come here to avoid the long waiting lines. Municipal Registry does door to door service? You pay 300 pounds and they send you an employee. 300 pounds! We're officers, and go for free. Wait for me inside. How do you do contracts without a register book? - They left? - They didn't suspect anything. - Good thing you had the register. - It's my daughter's school book. As of this minute, you and I don't know one another. Everybody's scared of going on the bus now. - I'll never go on a bus again. - Harassers deserve this and more. They deserve to be torn apart publicly. How can they tell if I'm a harasser? - Mum says dinner's ready. - Turn the lights off. - Aren't you going to eat? - No. - Is Omar happy with his new job? - Very. - Nelly... - I don't want to eat. I know how you feel. Maybe we don't give a damn about what people think... but when those close to us care, we too have to care. You are telling me this now? You raised me on these principles! You can't re-define what's right and wrong now! To hell with people! To hell with everyone! He seemed poor and of a low social standing. He was screaming with pain. We stitched the wound and sent him home. You did not get his personal information? No. He was found on the street, and didn't have his ID. What about his name? He didn't have a scar or any striking features? No, but I think his pants might still be here. - Can I see them, please? - Sure. You won't find anything in these pants. He's a bum, he won't leave anything in his pants. Except for a used 10 pound calling card. I think you are going through needless trouble. Nothing has happened in a month. Whoever did this, stopped. - So people have forgotten? - Yes. - They'll go back doing the same thing. - Right, sir. And the person who did this will strike again. Right? - Right. - Give me the card. Sorry, sir. You're going to be a brilliant detective. - Thank you, sir. - You get information from the trash. Hello. Serial Number 50833. 89511. Give me the number. OK... ok... ok... 916. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. No problem. I got it. Thank you. Bye. It's an unregistered line with no information. You're calling him? No, bad idea. This is what we should do. Hello. Good morning. This is Mohamed Hamdi, Target Co. Congratulations. Your mobile number won in today's draw. A40 inch LCD television screen. No, you don't have to pay fees. Nothing at all. Only your address, so we can deliver the television. Nothing is required from you. Morsi Street, 15, Darrassa. There are international standards that the world countries agree on... like borders and globalization, except for Egypt. Traffic lights have a different meaning. Green means 'go', yellow is 'go fast' and red is also go. - And you go faster cause I'm late. - What do you think? Make it green is 'go', yellow is 'go fast'... So what's new? And red is 'go faster if you can'. Faster if you can... Nice. Shame you are not on tonight. Come on, we're waiting. - Won't you come backstage? - I'll watch with the audience. As you wish. Seems like all of Egypt wants to learn self defense. You are almost there, because you decided to be here. I've said all there is to say. I will ask you for one thing, a tough one. There are three questions in this paper. Have you been sexually harassed? How many times? How did you react? Answer it. Excuse me, excuse me. What do I do to take your course? From what you said, he sounds like a decent guy. Decent guys are rare nowadays. Why are you asking me? Cause you are in women's rights and that stuff. Are you searching for someone to tell you leave him? Maybe. Men! They are well behaved when you are tough. Even at work I'm harassed all the time. Now, everybody's suddenly well behaved. - They must have heard about the bus. - Did you hear of it? - Yes. - If this is the solution... why doesn't the government apply it on harassers? I swear they'll clean up the country. - Are you Fayza? - Someone's here for you, Fayza. Fayza. She wants you. I know you. Aren't you the one who filed a lawsuit? - Yes. - Get a chair, Attef! - Sure madam. - Hurry up. Don't bother. Sit down here. I'll finish whatever you need. If you come when I'm not here, my colleague will help you. - Power of attorney? - Yes. - To whom? - Seba Sami. You know her. - Are you out of your mind? - I didn't know where to find you. So you just tell on me to just anyone? The police came after you. - Fayza, don't worry. - You don't even know me! I know you, Seba told me. You were Bossaina, who called me. I don't know any Bossaina. I'm Fayza. I don't know either of you. Calm down, Fayza. I swear I didn't tell anyone else. This is the girl who filed a lawsuit. Don't you admire her? She told me she admires the person who stabs those scumbags on buses. I don't buy it. If I'm arrested, I'll tell them it was your idea. Nice to meet you and goodbye. I don't want to see you. I have children. - Fayza. Fayza! - Goodbye. You don't know what you did. The country has changed... but, another 10 days, and they'll go back to it. I will with draw my lawsuit against my will! What do you want me to do? You want me to hit another to make you feel better and end up behind bars? - We want to do what you did. - Listen... people don't want us to file lawsuits. Our only solution is to do what you did. Enough is enough. - Welcome. - Thank you, madam. - We never won anything before. - Congratulations. - How many inches did you say it is? - 42, forty something. - Wow! - God Bless. Is Hamdi going to be late? No, he's on his way, but he's on crutches nowadays. Really? - Do you have a picture of him? - Yes. I get it for you? - Yeah. - OK. - His nicest picture ever. - God bless him! He's very young here. Don't you have a picture of him as an adult? No. I have the video of his sister's wedding. - Can we see it? - Sure. - God bless you. - I'll show it to you. - That's Amani, my daughter. - God bless her. That's Raafat, her husband. Seems Amani was in a hurry on her wedding night. - Walk faster. - Alright, sir. - Where? - Here, sir. - Here? - Yes. How come you didn't see her face? - I was walking behind her. - You trying to play dumb? You flirt with a girl without looking at her face? What does it have to do with her face? - Was she wearing a veil? - Yes, sir. I'm very cross with you, Hamdi. What can I do? I can't afford to get married. I'm seriously cross with you. Recording porn over your sister's wedding video? This sole needs to be replaced. - Just sew it on. - But it will fall off. Sew it. - I have money. Get a new sole. - Keep your money. I can afford new shoes, but my children are more deserving of that money. Someday when you have kids, you'll understand. It's bad enough that they're punished because of me. But it's not because of you. - Is this where the course is? - Yes. One, two, three... - See if there are any other Fayzas... - One second. Fayza Abdelmaksoud Kamel. - Check if there are other Fayzas. - OK. I can't repeat what I've done. - Why? - Buses are under surveillance. It doesn't have to be on buses. There's sexual harassment all over Egypt. It has to be a crowded place so that we don't get caught. There's one place that will definitely do. There's one overthere. - Where? - Behind that girl. - Can we hit him here? - No. Why, isn't it crowded enough? - He's not a harasser. - How do you know? He'd be looking at a specific point... then he looks around to check if someone's watching. He's just standing there, he's calm and not looking around him. - You should go home. - No. I'm fine. - Seba, you look awful. - I'm fine. Yes, Ramzi. - Can you see them? - Yes, sir. They look like they'll target someone in the crowd. Should I arrest them? - No, wait. - OK. If Egypt wins, you'll find tens of harassers. People will be on top of one another. - Let's hope we win. - I hope we lose. Goal! Zambia! Zambia! - Shall I arrest them now? - What for? For cheering for Zambia? What's wrong with you? - Good evening. - Evening, Farouk. This policeman wants you. Seba Sami Serrour? - Yes. - Come with me to the police station. Hello! The leader is here. Have a seat. Aren't you going to sit next to your friends and complete the Merry Trio? Excuse me. Why are we here? Don't play dumb, you know why you're here. - Can I say something? - Don't you dare speak unless I tell you! You don't have any evidence. We will speak in the presence of a lawyer. Sit down, don't get yourself into trouble. Sit down! The first one you hit was in Darrassa. Hamdi? Don't you remember him? Remind her, Ramzi. I can get Hamdi to identify you. Then the three of you can start playing the blame game. Each of you will then say: 'It wasn't me'. You will pay the price. These two come from big families, that will help them find a way out. Rememberthe Maadi Ripper? That guy who used a razor to rip girls' tight pants. You know how much time he was sentenced to? Fifteen years! Fifteen years for a razor and superficial injuries. So how much time will you serve? - Life sentence. - Indeed. No less than life in prison. If I wanted to arrest you red handed, I could have. I would have followed you till the next mistake. I would have arrested you, sentenced... but then the women's rights old hags would have come out... and made heroes of you. Every day, a new woman would come out to play Batman, just like you. We'd have to forget our important work and tend to your stupidities. Listen to me, I'm a practical man. I'm going to say this once. Once and for all. Goodbye. Get up, go home! Move it! Forget this ever happened. The cases will resolve themselves. If one of you thinks of touching a man... in the next 20 years... I'll put you all through hell. Don't tell your families. Make up a story if you have to. Goodbye. Hey, gorgeous. Good morning, star shine Good morning, sunshine - What's wrong with you, Fayza? - Adel! What are you doing? I got you this flower. You're a heavy fist. A flower? You never got me one before. I saw the black lingerie you got to make up with me. So I thought I should make up with you first. - What lingerie? - The black nightgown, my fair babe. That's not a nightgown. It's a dress and it's not mine. - Why? - Cause I can't pay you back. What's wrong? It's like we're living in sin! You're my wife. The wife you married for sex. I'm here to apologize for anything I said that might have hurt you. You couldn't please yourself so you come to me for your pleasure? Go to hell! I don't want to see your face again. - Adel. - Go away, Fayza. Good evening. I'm Nelly Roushdy, from Circle Co. If you allow me five minutes, I'll tell you about the benefits of our card. I don't have five minutes, I have something else for you. Why are you quiet? Are you shy? No, I'm just writing down your contacts, to personally deliver your card. Really? Yes. For that otherthing you are so proud of... I'll come and chop it off! Why are you quiet? Are you ashamed? Chop what off? What the hell did you say to him? Didn't you ask me to wait till he hangs up? He just did. OK, Adel. I'll call you back later. - What's wrong? - I have to tell you something. - Me too. - What? The bank wants me to be in charge of its department for double my salary. You'll be a manager? So no more stand-up comedy? What about acting? What about your dreams? I can go back to them later. Now we can get married sooner. What were you going to tell me? Nothing. I never know what to say to you. - But you wanted to tell me something. - I love you, Omar. I love you so much. Me too. I'll teach you something. Watch where you're going! Catch him! Thief! Thief! I'm not a thief. I didn't steal anything! - You are a thief. - Calm down. I'll beat him up. Calm down, madam. We'll deal with him. Easy, he's just a child. In one month something else will happen... and it'll be the talk of the town. Don't worry, it will be forgotten. One sec please. Where's the maternity ward? - Which room? - I don't know. Mrs. Magda Menshawi. - Room 406. - Obrigado. Sorry, sir. It's my responsibility. Magda. I'm here. I'm late, but I'm here. Seba. Open the door. Seba! I miss you. Divorce me, Sherif. I love you, Seba. I love you too... but I can't forgive you. Since we were at school, I never wanted to hurt you. I was pregnant. And lost the baby. You know why? Because when I needed you you weren't there. Now every time I see you, I remember what they did to me. I can't forgive you. Divorce me, please. Please, divorce me. I'm divorcing you. The food's in the kitchen and we'll do the laundry tomorrow. Thank you, mum. I appreciate. Here you go. What are you going to name her? - Her? - Yes. - It's a girl? - Don't you know you have a girl? I'll drop by tomorrow. Every time I discuss anything with anyone... I get the same response. "That's how Egyptians are. That's how they are." It's as if Egyptians are not around. Or they're here, but don't speak Arabic. We can speak freely, 'cause they don't understand. Do you know who are the Egyptian people? It's you and I. Good thing we met. Cause we have a lot to discuss. Come in, Fayza. Did you see the comedian? The guy I did not understand out there? They're jokes. Let me tell you my act. Nelly, I'm on next and then you. Are you ready? I want you to rock the house... by the time they leave I want them to remember only you. Make them laugh. - Nelly, I need you for a second please. - One second. I have to go pick up my kids. I'm sorry, I'm going on stage now. I love you. What's wrong? Why did you call me? Just wait till Seba comes and I'll tell you everything. I have to hurry to my kids... There she is. What's up? I just want to tell you about something I'll do. Like what? Like this. - What's this? - It has nothing to do with you. When they arrest me I'll claim responsibility. - Do you want to go to prison? - I'm in prison. This won't fix anything. It doesn't matter. Either I drop the lawsuit or lose Omar. I lose both ways. Everything is forgotten and back to square one. - Nothing changed. - It's not worthwhile. Now you think it's not worthwhile? You never said that to me. Or do you have double standards? I was mistaken! I was blinded by what happened to me. - Case closed, I'm going ahead with it. - No, you won't. What we did was wrong. Two wrongs don't make a right. We'd be like them. - You and I are not like that. - Am I like that? - Is anything bothering you? - No. You can sleep? Suddenly I am abnormal? No normal person can do what you did and live on normally. - They can, if they don't feel guilty. - What guilt? It doesn't matter any more. Tell me why do I feel guilty? - Don't you know? - No, I don't. I'll tell you. Your closet is full of short and scanty clothes. My husband thought the dress you gave me was a nightgown. Your hair that's all over the place? You live alone and move around as you please. - How does your family allow this? - Should I too feel guilty? Let me go see my kids. You're not leaving till you tell me why I'm guilty. You go out freely with your fianc? and no one questions you! Men now think that all women are as loose as you are. At the end I and women like me pay the price. We're the ones who suffer to be discreet and avoid attention! - What happened to you was my fault? - It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's her fault. Her backward thinking is the cause of our problems. Women wore short dresses and no one heard of sexual harassment. Because they could get married, not because bare skin taught modesty. Enough. Enough said. You ask people to do things that you won't do. - I never saw you wear copper jewelry. - I don't want to draw attention. Cover up your hair and stop wearing tight clothes. If you were not feeling guilty, you would have done what I did. But you can never be like me... because you know it's your fault. Good evening. Amonth ago, as my fianc?e was dropping me off at home... a truck driver was passing me... and he sexually harassed me. Then he ran off. Everyone gathered around us. All the men stood together as one man and did nothing. An old wise man asked me: 'What did he steal from you? ' I told him: 'He didn't steal, he harassed me sexually'. He said: 'Thank God nothing happened! We thought he's stolen something'. He told me you have to take him to the police station. - "What? - Take him to the police station. Excuse me?" Turns out I personally have to take him there? So my mum, my fianc? and I cram into the carfront seat... and the harasser lounges like a prince on the back seat. And at the end of this saga... everyone pressures me to drop the lawsuit. Why? But why? 'You will scandalize us.' It's my scandal when I say 'ouch'. How dare you say 'ouch'? Do you know what every girl needs from a man? Safety. And I no longerfeel safe. At all. Do you want to take my seat? No thanks. I'm getting off at the next stop. Adel. Adel! - What happened? - It's OK, madam. - You? - What? I had a minor accident. - What's wrong with you? - Why do you do this? You could've taken a second wife... or divorced me... but never lay a finger on a woman against her will! - Stop it! - You stop it! Why did you turn yourself in? So she can play hero. In less than an hour, we'll have the media circus here. Please, go wash yourface and speak calmly to them. I don't want them to call you crazy. If they call you crazy, your efforts will be wasted. Do you understand? I don't want to see or talk to anyone. Seba... do what you want. Just tell me and I will help you. I'm as criminal as they are, that is why I turned myself in. In that case, then you should go home. - Un-cuff her. - She just confessed, sir. She's done nothing to confess to. Do you have an official complaint? Did Hamdi file a report? The lemon guy? You have no official complaints! Give me the keys. We have no complaints because it would also be a confession of harassment. As long as there are no official reports, it's not my problem. Go now. - What do you want, madam? - Never punish my kids again. OK. Put your arms down. We won't punish them again. Lower your arms. Court in session! Case 673 year 2009. Is she present? Yes sir. Your lawyer requested to drop the suit? Will you drop the charges? No, sir, she won't! No, sir, I won't drop the lawsuit. Quiet! Quiet please. Does my hair look better now? Nice. But it was also nice before. The Court sentenced the harasser in Nelly's case to 3 years in prison. A year later, legislation was passed to criminalize harassment in Egypt. Reports remain to be rare.
