BASQUE COUNTRY, 1985 FREEDOM FOR THE BASQUE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE FIGHT TO WIN, VOTE HERRI BATASUNA Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! NUCLEAR? NO, THANKS. Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! FREEDOM -What'll it be, Anselmo? The usual? -The usual. Hey! Stop, stop! PRISONERS HOME Long live the ETA Military Wing! Long live the ETA Military Wing! Long live...! BASQUE POLICE Turncoat! Son of a bitch! -Son of a bitch! -Dog! -One! -Two! Another two there. Another two! Amazing! Here! Two, two! I've got two! -We split them up later, I'm saying. -How many do you want? Four! Gimme one, gimme one! ONCE UPON A TIME IN EUSKADI Man! These bounce double, Toni. Sure, they're bigger than the Guards ones. That's why they bounce more, retard. Don't call me retard! Moron then. The Police ones are bigger and softer, to do less damage. Being Basque cops, they have to do less damage. It's obligatory. Really? Sure. My uncle told me, the TV news said so. The brother of a guy at his factory was killed by one of the Guards' ones. Does your uncle have a factory, Toni? You're a twit. -Your brother was at the protest. -I know. But he's an immigrant. What's he going for? So? Your name's Romero Cabezas and to be in ETA you have to be Basque and speak Basque. Euskera, not Basque. It's "Euskera". My brother doesn't speak it yet, but he understands everything. And he is Basque. He was born in Vitoria, like me. Vitoria is Spain, kid. But does your brother want to be in ETA? How does that go? You have to sign up, right? My uncle says if you go to lots of protests, they eventually get you. -Jeez, your uncle again! -The ETA bosses? What if you don't want to? If you do, it's because you want to. Then they'll get your brother, because he always goes. That's not how it goes! When he's older, maybe. Your brother's over 18, he can go to prison. Yeah, right! For going to a protest... FINISHING LINE Jesús! You take the lads. I have to give the judge the list of finishers, okay? Fine. Take it easy, He'll come in the broom wagon. Are you going? No way, Luis Mari. It came a while ago. Well, he won't be long. -Are you on mornings next week? -Yes. Then I'll see you on Monday. Right then. -What's up, lads? -Hello. -How are you, uncle? -Hi. -Bad, I fell off. -Jeez! -'Bye, Marcos, till Saturday. -'Bye. Coming to train tomorrow? Yes, we're meeting at 9 in Gaizka's father's workshop. -Are you coming? -Yes. -'Bye. -'Bye. Come around tomorrow for snails, okay? -'Bye, guys. -'Bye, see you tomorrow. I don't know why he trains so much, if he doesn't fall off, he gets a flat. Like you with Euskera, you can't even count. I can't count? More than you, smarty. Look. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Toni, snails are disgusting, man. Tell him to make something else, like fried eggs. Or eat at home and say you've got a bellyache. You know, Toni? Put vinegar on them to get off the mucus. -Off who? -The snails. Oh, snails have mucus? Well, I like them. OUR COUNTRY MUST LIVE! How are you doing, Marcos? It'll be dinner soon. I'm not hungry. You have to have dinner, lad. What's wrong, Marcos? Nothing. You'll see, on Saturday you'll do great. It's a better race for you, remember last year. Dad, I fell off. That's it. Alright then... When you're done with that, wash your hand and dinner, you have to be strong tomorrow to train. -Toni, go get your brother. -I don't know where he is. Then look for him. Go on! I'm splitting. I'm going to look for "Maserati". Let's go, Blackie. ...when they tell us. For 580 pesetas, names of cities and towns in Castile-Leon and Andalusia that aren't capitals of their 17 provinces. For example, Astorga. One, two, three, answer again. -Astorga. -Astorga. -Villamanín. -Villamanín. -Sueros de Cepeda. -Sueros de Cepeda. -Villar del Olmo. -Villar del Olmo. Let's hear Miser Men! We can't accept Villar del Olmo as it's a town in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. I don't know, tell us. No. Can't you see it's heavy stuff? Really, no... Then be gentle, but tell us. No, let's forget it... No, tell us, tell us! Alright, I will, but it's heavy stuff. The movie I'm shooting now, right? A shot of a dog... -Dad. -...completely naked. What is it, Paquito? When are we buying the video? Soon, son, soon. And when is that? When I get the bonus. You're such a drag, Paquito! You're such a drag. Francisco, bring me the girl's robe! Francisco, can't you hear your mother? Paquito, can't you hear you mother? She's calling you, damn it. Coming. What are you gawping at? I want to do a crap. Wait, alright? Come on, honey. That's it. Pura! Christ! Another one! The patience you need. -Pura! -The patience! -Dinner! -On the way! Mum, heat up the meatballs for him. Your husband's got two arms. I'm not the little lord's maid. -Holy Mary! -Out of the way. -Don't forget to flush, eh? -Yes. Well... CONDEMNED TO STRUGGLE -Where's your brother? -I don't know, I haven't seen him. Or looked for him. Who knows where you were. I'm so sick of you two. Dinner's in the fridge. How do you want your omelette? Plain or ham and cheese? Plain! -What did he say? -Plain. -Why are you up so early? -I couldn't sleep any more. Less bike and more studying, get that into your son's head. Not all this training, racing and breakfast. You spoil him. On the bike, he's out of trouble. Studying, for example. I hate seeing him a wreck every Saturday, Jesús. Something always happens to him. He's had bad luck. It'll change. Bloody bad luck! Every weekend it's bad luck. Get him to run, it's safer, cheaper... Carmen... Breakfast, champ! Champ? Careful, it's hot. Okay. Morning, son. Fede. Fede. Remember, everyone: Go over the relative pronouns, exclamations, interrogatives and above all the verbs: "can, go to bed, walk and be". José Antonio, remember, there'll be two exams this year, one written and one oral. Okay. 'Bye! Right, 'bye. -What are you doing here? -Nothing, I want to be with you. But you can't be here now. I want to do what you do. Lower your voice. What I do? What do I do, José? You're here, you go to demonstrations. But do you know why you want to do it? Because you do. What are you doing here? Go to your father, now! -And what about you? -Mum... It's shameful! Don't you put this stuff in his head. Stop loafing and get to work, you have to pitch in at home. Things are tight, and they'll get worse. So if you're not going to study, you know what there is. Your dad's out of work again, and I'll wear my hands out -mopping doorways. -What do you want? Is it my fault that Dad's useless? Never talk about your father like that again! Mariano, let's go. -Your brother? -In bed. I'm not promising anything, eh? Yes, Pepe, okay. I'll tell him. Okay, yes. -Yes, I'll tell him. -A kiss for your dad. Okay, okay. Kisses from Jesús. Okay. A kiss for everyone. 'Bye. What does your cousin say? Why rent a flat when he's got a house? We've been over that. It's a commitment. Fuck... Then he has to look out for us, he can't be by himself. It's one thing or another... In the end, we don't enjoy it and neither do they. So, Jesús? We haven't had a holiday for three years, three years without seeing Granada. We can't rent a flat and you know it. This year we will, you'll see. Even for a fortnight, or a week. -What are you going to do? -Something, leave it to me. What time are the kids coming? Shit, I didn't tell them anything. Marcos can call when he gets in. What time is it? -Almost 1. -He'll be here soon. Let's go inside, he'll be here soon. Relax, when something bad happens, the news travels fast. He just got held up. Go down to the bar and tell my dad, I'll set the table. I don't get why you have to go so far away to train. And take off that helmet at lunch, please. Mum, it's not my fault we got lost. I got a flat tyre. And it's a "chichonera", not a "helmet". -A "chicha" what? -It's a "chichonera". Helmets are bigger. In Gaizka's father's workshop there's a supercool one. You will get me one, no? They're much safer. Lend him yours, Paquito. Be cool. -Retard. -Dry Turd. "Dry Turd"? When I buy the video you're not watching any movies! -You're buying a video, Paquito? -Yes, with my dad's bonus. Isn't that great! The helmet's for your birthday, son. Do what you like. I'm talking about safety. If you got lost, why didn't you ask? What do you think we did, Mum? And having lunch at 4... Unbelievable! You should've told your boss to tell his son and his friends not to train so far away. They get lost and that bike worries the hell out of me. And Dad, you could eat like a human being! And drink some water, you're going to choke. -Do you like snails? -Yes. Paquito's stuffed himself. Good. Please, we're worried. We haven't heard from him all day. Ask José, they go the arcade to... Tell him to ask Milagros. -Josefa says to ask Milagros. -Especially Milagros. Especially Milagros. No, wait, here he is. Where have you been? Have you seen the time? What happened to you? -I fell over, Mum, that's all. -You fell over? Who'd believe that? -I'm fine. -You're covered in blood. I'm fine. I just fell over. -You fell over? -José Antonio's here! Please! -That's it then. -Who'd believe you fell over? -That's it. -Please! That's it. Incredible... Always these nasty surprises. Fuck. "A restaurant serves 96 sandwiches. If each one is worth 64 pesetas, how many pesetas does the restaurant make from the sandwiches it served?". Don't shit me. How do I tell you? Batches, units... You've been here for 3 years. It's not that much work. It's not the Tourmalet climb. -Luis Mari. -Hi, Jesús, you champ. You'll go on strike, right? Yes... No... Well, we have to do what the majority says. Well, the majority... Here, the majority's all of us. So, what is it? I'd like to do night shift until August. We haven't had a holiday in three years and... Right. Here, fill this in. But I warn you, there's a waiting list, alright? -Yes. Thanks. -Anything else? No. Well, Luis Mari, yes. I wanted to say one thing. Go ahead. Why don't you tell your son, if it's no bother, could you tell your son... not to stand Marcos up? Stand Marcos up? Yes, yesterday they did it again. Right. It's not good that they do that to the lad, Luis Mari. Marcos is a kid, he's having a tough time and... Well, you know him. He does his best, but... If you could please... talk to your son so that they don't do it anymore. If they don't want to train with him, they can make something up, but they can't stand him up. Look, Carmona, let's do this... When we knock off, let's talk in the office. I want to discuss this too, alright? Right. See you at 2. My dad wants to buy that one. -A Beta video! -Sure, Betas are much better. And they told my dad that VHS will be gone soon. How does your dad know that? -They told him. -Who? I don't know. They just told him. You're so lucky, Paco. A video, man. Yeah, man. Wild. -Does your mum know you're suspended? -No way. Ricardo wants her to call him. My brother pretended to be her and he didn't realize. Sure, your mum's got a man's voice. Shall I beat your face in, Dry Turd? Stop, stop, stop. I'll be right there. -It's your brother. -Where the hell have you been? The fronton court, waiting for these guys. Here. You'll be alone all day, okay? I got some work outside, I don't know when I'll be back. Your mum left this morning, she'll be back tonight. You've got macaroni in the fridge, I think. Or go to the house of one of these guys. Here. -Thanks. -You've got keys, right? -Yeah. -Okay, I'm off. You can come to my place for lunch. No. I'll leave drop him off and go play some machines. -Ciao. -Ciao, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Let's go, Blackie. Meet up later? I have to train. I've got Euskera class. -Right, ciao. -Ciao. 'Bye. You're dumping him? Dumping him? At 12 you're throwing him off the team? He's a kid. That's the way it is. You think it's odd and they're kids, but keeping a cycling team going costs a fortune. A fortune. The registrations every Saturday, the licence, the gear, the gas, the premises, tons of things. And as of September, the sponsor. We have to find another. That's another thing! But how do I tell the kid you've thrown him off the team -because he's bad? -Not because he's bad, Jesús, he doesn't have what it takes. This is a tough sport, you know it. Not everyone's cut out for it. Then it's because he's bad. Jesús, you must see that Marcos holds back the lads when we're cycling, eh? We can't do proper training. He doesn't follow the others. You have to wait for him all the time because he gets lost. Get cycling out of his head. Take him a couple of Sundays to Atotxa to see Real. Maybe watching Zamora he'll get a passion for football... -How much money? -What? Yes, how much money for... the licences, premises, all that? I don't know, I'd have to add it up. Don't throw him off yet. Wait until the race on Saturday. Your dad said for your birthday. My birthday's ages away. There's no helmet! And you, Jesús, stop that. Fill it in later. Have lunch. I'm finishing up. It has to go to Felipe on night shift to put on Luis Mari's desk. -The sooner he has it, the better. -They'll choose the usual ones. We'll see. Will you stop playing with the lentils and eat? I don't like lentils. You have to eat lentils, they have lots of iron. Tell your son to eat, he won't listen to me. Marcos, didn't you hear your mother? Lentils. Eat! No, no, no! No getting up until you eat them. I'm telling you, eh? If not for lunch, for afternoon snack. And if not, then for dinner. Marcos, Toni, are you coming to play football? Maybe we'll take a walk. Dickhead! Toni, can you come for a moment? It's been two weeks since your suspension and your mother hasn't come to talk to me as we agreed. I don't know. You didn't tell her, did you? I did tell her. Really, miss. Then why hasn't she come? How's your brother? Fine, same as ever. I haven't seen him for ages. Sometimes he gets work out of town. Is he still a builder? Sometimes, yes, whatever he can get. Right. I'd really like to talk to your mother, Toni. She's not at home. Yesterday she went off with the man she's with now. And you're alone? With my brother. Do you know when your mother's coming back? No. I'm definitely buying a Beta. A lot of people have told me that VHS is throwing money away. What an impulsive man. Why do we want a video? Again? What do you know about videos? Liver again? I don't like it, it makes me gag. Gag or not, you're eating it! That's enough. -Will you take off that bloody beret? -It's not a "beret", it's a "txapela". And it has to go like this. It has to adjust to your head. I have to explain everything here! Your dad's got a fat head, son. That's why the beret won't fit. You look awful, son. Are you listening to your mother, Pura? Badgering all day... Shit! Hey, am I lying? -Wasn't there a bigger one, Dad? -No, there wasn't. See? It's like I said. Who's that at this hour? Toni. Come in, son. -Why have you got the dog here? -It was open downstairs. Right. What do you want? Nothing. In case Paquito had had dinner and was going downstairs. No. We're having dinner now and it's too late for him to go out. It's Monday, honey. Go on, get along home. -See you tomorrow, Paquito. -See you tomorrow, Toni. Watch yourself, eh? Doesn't your friend have a home? Yes. It's as if he didn't, Mum. What a pitiful family. Will you turn off bloody radio at dinner? However much you wear a beret and listen to the radio, you'll never learn Basque in your life, you pinhead! Ignorance is evil, Pura. Evil and bold. I'll tell you one thing: languages come by listening. Listening is essential. How did I return from Germany? Tell the boy. -How did I return from Germany? -Penniless. Do you speak German, Dad? Not actually speak it. Well, a little. Kartoffel, potato. Bier, beer. Auf Wierdersehen, goodbye. Now, understanding it... I understand it all. You have understand, Paquito, or people trick you. And with Basque it'll be the same. As sure as my name's Anselmo Sánchez! Oh, Germany, Germany... Let's eat, "Beckenbauer". Alright! But just until the end of the season. If the results aren't there, he's out next season. Any news on the shifts? I told you no, Carmona. I'll put up the list of names when it comes out. Thanks a lot. -What did she say? -She wants younger people. -Younger? -Yes. Well, it's alright. -We'll keep looking. -Hey, of course. The old lady, like she's so young. -Did you buy anchovies? -We'll go later. -Mariano. -What? We have to speak to Félix today. If you don't, I will. You have to be tougher with the boy. He disrespects you and you're his father, Mariano. If he won't study, fine, but has to work, to pitch in. Look at us. We can't get by, Mariano. -I'll talk to him. -Good. At his age, how long had you been working? Years. Yes or no? -That was a different time. -That may be, but we're just as poor, or more so, than when we came from the village. If my father could see us, he'd have an attack. Taking us out of the village for this... Josefa. What? Why did you hit Félix the other day? For being where he was and doing what he was doing. Are you sure? Of course. Félix wasn't doing anything wrong. Sure, that's what you say. José Antonio, son, what are you doing? What are you doing here? Nothing, looking. Where's your brother? He'll be at home. Then let's go have lunch. Félix! See if your brother's in his room. He's not there. -Wait, Marcos, wait. -What? -Is your number on right? -Yes, look. -Water in the bottle? -As well. -And food? -You just gave it to me! Okay, okay. Right, guys, let's go. -Come on! -Marcos! -Come on, Marcos! -Come on, come in. My dad's such a drag. Come on! Move it, Dad! Come on, let's go! -Go! -Come on, Marcos! -Come on! -Come on, go! Come on! Go! C'mon, go! Go, go, go! -Come on! -Come on! Careful, careful! -Did you see him? -Not me. Me neither. Where is he? Come on, champ. Come on, champ. It's over now. Come on. He's alright. He's alright from the fall. He doesn't need stitches, they're just cleaning the cut. They'll just put on a bandage. Here you are, champ. That's 4000 pesetas. It's nice. Okay? Are you going to wear it? -Yes. -Yes? Jesús! The night shift lists, they've put them up. NOT SUITABLE. Why do you want us to go to my cousin's place now? Well... He'll feel bad if we get a flat if he's got the house. -My cousin? It's Pepe. -Yes. -I don't want him throwing it in our faces. -Right. I told him we weren't going, but I'll call him. We save this way. This man... I don't know, Pepe. No, the whole month is a lot. A week, 10 days at most. The first fortnight? Yes, well... Okay, we'll bring it. Yes. Yes. How could I not bring it? Yes, cheese too. Yes, Okay. A big kiss for my aunt and the cousins. Okay, right, I'll call you. Okay. 'Bye. 'Bye, 'bye. -What did he say? -We stay the whole month. The whole month! No, no way. No way. And what else? We're to take him chistorra. He's obsessed with chistorra. What a drag, eh? Don't call him a drag, he does his utmost for us. He likes chistorra and they don't have it there, eh? Don't get give him a hard time, you stuff yourself with piononos when we're at his place. Why? There aren't any here. It's the same with Pepe. So, shut it. Hello? Oh, hello, Josefa. Yes. No. I haven't seen him. Marcos isn't here. I don't know, girl. Take it easy. He'll turn up. Hold on. The boy just came in. I'll put him on. Here. José Antonio's mother, to see if you've seen Félix. Hello. No, I didn't see him on the street. I just came from school. Okay. Right, 'bye. They haven't seen him all day. Him too... What's he up to? I'll tell you what he's up to. Lunch. Toni. Wait. Félix. Blackie... -What's up, man? -Hangin' out. When you see my brother, give him this. Why don't you give it to him? Are you guys fighting? Don't ask. Give it to him, eh? Okay. And you haven't seen me. -'Bye. -'Bye. What are we doing here, Mariano? Sleeping, resting. We should've gone to the police. The police? 24 hours hasn't gone by. We should still be looking for him, no? Josefa, we've spent all day looking everywhere for him. He'll be at a friend's house... -...or some sweetheart. -Please, Mariano, really! A sweetheart? -Yes, he's a man. -"Sweetheart", he says. I wish. Do what you like. I'm not staring at the ceiling, not knowing where my son is. FRANCE Are you going to tell me or not? Let's take a walk. If they'd given me the night shift, none of this would've happened. -Did I tell you or not? -Sure. What do you want me to do? Listen to me, tell me things. Don't get your hopes up so high. 'Bye, Isabel. Sometimes you seem like a bigger kid than Marcos. Isn't it the third year they didn't give it to you? No wonder you were so a pain about going to my cousin's house. Yeah, well... -What did he say about the boy? -Just that, -he improves or he's out. -My poor boy. -Hello. -Hello, what's up? -Any news of Félix? -No, no. We've looked all over town, called everybody and... -nothing at all. -You'll have to report it, no? -Yes, we'll have to report it. -Yes, we will. -Relax, he'll turn up. -Yes. We're going home, José Antonio's been alone all day and... -Right, see you later. -You know where we are. -Thanks, honey. -Right, 'bye. They really have a problem, we don't, Jesús. Let's head home as well. It takes away the urge to walk. Mum! I watch the important things. -What? -Throw me the key! Alright... here goes! Hello. -Francisco! -Kid! Francisco, son! Are you alright? Come on, get up. Anselmo, your son! Are you alright? Yes? Take that off and put some ice on, they boy will get an infection. Shut up and let me do it! It reduces the swelling, see? -Now you're a doctor too. -It's the old way! Are you alright, sweetie? What's your name, honey? -Mirta. -Mirta. Where are you from? Cuba, ma'am. -Here, take one -What are they? Pestiños, a popular sweet where I come from. Cuba's very far away. Yes. Another thing, in this house we eat lots of Cuban-style rice. -Really? -From your country. -It doesn't exist in my country. -Oh, no? No, you invented it, like Russian salad. Really? Russian salad isn't from Russia either? -No. -How about that! What a lack of ed-ja-cation! Well, I'm going. Thanks for everything. -'Bye, son. -God be with you, honey. Does it hurt? How could it not hurt? Stop fanning him, you'll give him a cold. Mum. Mum! Hello, Blacky. ...the situation before man altered the ecological balance, almost all the animals depend on each other. There's a long, fantastic chain from humble grass to the vulture's beak, by way of the wild boar and the wolf's fang. I'm going to ask them. Can't you see he's not there? -I'm going to ask them. -Josefa! Wait. I'm looking for my son. His name's Félix. You know him, the other day you were next to him. My name's Josefa and my son comes here a lot, to do this. We haven't seen him for days. So, if anyone knows anything, please... tell us. We live right there, 2nd floor. That's my husband, his name's Mariano. Please, if anyone knows anything, let us know. Please. Thank you. Let's go. Hello? Hello? Hello? Félix? They hung up. Excuse me. Will you come with me, please? -You dig the black girl, huh? -No I don't. You fucking fibber. It's obvious. Liar. Sure, sure. -Know what this is? -I don't know, an envelope. Sure, but do you know who gave it to me? Mirta? What? You retard. See, you do like her! No, Félix gave it to me, to give to him. But I haven't yet. Why not? Because since he gave it to me, he hasn't been back in town. I wonder what it says. Something shitty, for sure. What does it say? You idiot... I'm telling you I don't know, man. You don't get it. I'm scared to open it. Let him open it, it's his. Why don't we open it carefully and stick it back with saliva? Or open it and tell him he gave it to us open. Gave "us"? Don't get me mixed up in this. Then don't read it. I won't, I don't care. But don't bug me about it. You're a retard. And I'm telling you this?! It's a secret. He gave it to me, it was secret. Do I beat your face in? -No! -No? You dry turd... Toni, pick all that up, your brother's coming from hospital. And you boys, out. Are you deaf? Get out of here! Toni's mum's got a fucking temper! Sure does. You're pretty late, eh? -Maserati's fucked up, huh? -Sure is. What do you want? He's a junkie. -How do you know? -My brother told me. -Isn't your brother back yet? -No. The black girl waved at you, the hairdresser. I don't care about her. And her name's Mirta. You guys just don't get it. Game in the fronton court? Go on, cool. You bring the ball, Jose? Thank you. I'm fucked, bro'. Leave Fede alone, he has to rest. TOMORROW SOCIETY WILL BE YOUR PRISON. HELP THE INMATES. Your brother's very sick, Toni. They've discovered that he has a very serious illness. But he'll get better. He always gets better. You'll see. Not this time. Why? Because he's going to die. Fede has AIDS, son. But isn't that the homo disease? And drug addicts. But is Fede a homo? No, Toni. Fede's not a homo. What's wrong, lad? Congratulations on your marks, Bea. Álvaro. Francisco. Isa. Toni. Luisa. Diego. And... José Antonio. And for those who have to come back in September, do me a favour and study, eh? Not like usual. You have all the time in the world to play. Have fun, go to the beach, the swimming pool... Holidays give you time for everything. Make the most of this wonderful sun. Happy summer, everyone. Some days it seems like the sun will never fade... and others are sadder than a farewell at the station. It's just like our life, it's all going fine and one day you turn the corner and you're turned around too. That spider web hanging in my room, I don't take it down, it's only taking up its corner. I grew up near the railroad tracks, and that's why I know... EMERGENCIES ...that sadness and joy travel on the same train. You want to see the world? Look, it's under your feet. THE VIDEO OF YOUR LIFE As the years go by, nothing's as I dreamt it. Unless you shut your eyes well, many things are unseen. I'm not afraid of the Devil. Don't you see that I can't burn? There's no more fire in hell than inside my skin. You want to see the world? Look, it's under your feet. Hello? Félix! Yes, I'm alone. But why did you go? No, I don't know where they are. Aren't you going to talk to them? They're really worried. Okay. I was studying. Sure I'm going to pass, you'll see. I'm studying hard, like you always say. Me too. Why won't you come? Mum and Dad are coming in. Who was it? It was Toni. Wait for me downstairs from my place and when my parents and grandma have gone, I'll whistle, okay? Okay. If Sawdust's brother doesn't hurry... -Sure, man. What's the time? -6:10. No shit! Yes. Look, here he comes. What's up, guys? -Got the cash? -Yes. Okay, come in with me, choose the movie and wait outside. Okay. ADULT CINEMA Man, look at those pears! -Jeez, amazing. -There are loads! Come on, guys, I haven't got all day. -Which one do we get? -I don't know. They're all cool. Then this one. No fucking way! He's stuck on the black girl, so he wants us to watch this. -No, no. -Shut up, Dry Turd. Alright... This one? -Okay. -This one. No, not that one... My brother got nauseous watching it, okay? -You get nauseous watching porn? -If it's heavy stuff, yes. No shit... Look, you guys, to start, I'd choose this. -Let me see. -"The Pink Shell". -"The Pink Shell". -Fuck... -Sounds cool, right? -Yeah, yeah. -This one. -Yeah. C'mon, go, go. This one. Go, go, go! Get off! Fuck, your parents took ages to go! -What's wrong? -Lower your voice. My grandma's sick, she's napping in her room. What do we do? Some has to be a lookout in the hallway. -Not me. -You draw lots. -Us? What about you? -It's my house, my video... Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, catch a tiger by the toe... -Let's go! -That sucks! José, on lookout. You two stay here. -Keep good lookout, eh? -Fuck! Don't make her cry. Soothe her. Give me the movie, turn on the TV, hurry. -How about Paquito, eh? -Don't look at me! Stop laughing or I can't concentrate. Don't look! Keep a lookout! Fuck! ALL FOR COUNTRY He's coming out. He cuts himself, invents falls, punctures the tyre... I don't know... That's what Luis Mari said. So when he falls off, he doesn't actually fall off? Something like that. It appears he was seen... He gave me back the money and the boy's off the team, as of now. What do we do? How do we tell him? My whole body feels awful, Jesús. I can't think of anything. Saturday's the last race, we have to think of something. -Open it. -What's this? Just open it. But... But... I pawned my mother's cutlery and this is what I got. At least with these two things we can rent a flat in Granada. But Carmen... How can you be so good? Return the money and get back the cutlery. We'll work it out. The main thing now is how the hell we tell the boy. You knew, didn't you? What? What your son was doing. Did you know? Mum's a real bitch. Don't say that. But it's true. Why are you here looking after me like a nurse? Because you're my brother. Never mind. Mum's a fucking pig, that's that. Where the hell is she? What's she doing? How should I know? Toni. What? Cremate me. Don't talk crap. You'll get better, you'll see. Like fuck I will. Fuck God and the Virgin. Promise me. Promise what? That you'll cremate me. Who's going to come see me in the cemetery? Your mother or what? If you died, I'd go. But you're not going to die. Cremate me. And do what you like with the ashes. But you do it, okay? Throw me down the toilet or into the river, or snort me. Anything but put me in a fucking niche. Mum doesn't love us. She's never loved us. Only Dad loved us. Then why did he run off! When I croak, leave this town. Listen to me. You're a smart guy, Toni. Leave this fucking house. Go to our uncle in Bilbao or wherever. Mum can go fuck herself. INDEPENDENCE AND SOCIALISM Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! Prisoners on the street! Full amnesty! You may begin the exam. Antxon, excuse me. José Antonio, can you come outside for a moment, please? Why? I wasn't copying. Come outside. What's wrong? -Is Dry Turd coming or not? -I don't know. Look, there he is. -We've been waiting a while. -What? I couldn't come sooner. Relax, okay? Why are you wearing that in this heat? What do you care? Give it here, dickhead! Fuck, Paquito. You're getting worse and worse. You got no fucking idea! -Shall we go in? -Go on. Fucking let go! Hurry, hurry! FÉLIX, WE WILL NOT FORGET YOU -Poor Jose. -Yeah, naturally. His brother died from a bomb. I'm going home. -Fuck, my parents! Cover me up! -Fucking stop it! -Shit! -Cover him! Can't you see he doesn't want them to see him? Do your parents know about your hair? No. So what? You've got some balls, Paquito. Are you going to wear that cap all day? I don't know, I'll see. Leave me alone. -I'm outta here. -Me too. Mirta! Mirta! Mirta, don't go! Mirta, look at me! Mirta, don't go, please! What? I can't hear you! Look at me! What did you do to your hair? -You bloody kid...! -Dad, let go of me! I'm sorry, but I have to close the hall. Come on, José Antonio. Come with me. Walk. What a head, Paquito. That really sucks. Will you stop fucking around?! They made you look fucking bald, man. And what's that cut? My Dad, the machine got stuck. Are they going to leave you like that? I don't know. Hey, José, what's it like being the town's favourite son? No fucking idea. Maybe they'll name a street after your brother. Or a square. Really? For all time? For all time. Jeez! That's cool, huh? Has your dad got a job yet? Yes, as a streetsweeper for the Council. Is it permanent? I don't know, maybe. So you're not going on holidays? No. Like me. They may send me to a reformatory. You'll shit yourself, it's worse than military service. I don't care. I don't know which is worse. He's dressing. He's dressing. -Are you sure about this? -Got a better idea? Then tell him. Tell him? Don't talk crap. Are you crazy? -If anyone sees you, how embarrassing. -No one will. Don't be mean. Here he is. Marcos, what about today? What about it? Are you meeting your friends to train or going alone? I'm meeting them at Gaizka's workshop. Where are you training today? I don't know, Dad. Around. Around? Right. We're meeting at Gaizka's workshop because Xabi's bike broke. Then we'll go... to the usual place. I'm going for a leak. Well... Let's go, let's go! What is it? -Here. -What do you mean, "here"? Think about it. Not here, I'll have to do it in the street. That's what I say. Oh, sure, sure. What are you doing? -Nothing. -Nothing. There you go. Helmet. I'm off. I'm going too. I have to get some smokes. Hey, you! Marcos, someone took your bike! Let's go, let's go! They're taking your bike, Marcos! Stop! -Are you alright? -Yes. -Are you alright? -Yes. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks, really. I'm fine, really. What do I tell my parents now? They'll kill me. If it was stolen, it was stolen. Didn't you see anyone? A friend told me he looked like a Gypsy. Bastards! Hey, can I tell them I lent it to you? Okay, but what if your parents say something to mine? This sucks. Where did you leave the bike? -At Pura's place. -Pura's place? -What if her son sees it? -He won't see it. And do me a favour and stop laughing. Dad. That's it. Look, what's done is done. On Sunday, after the race, the bike will appear. All sweet. We'll see in September. We have all summer to think of what to do. -Are you going or will I? -No, you, you. Marcos! Where's the bike? I lent it to Paquito. To Paquito? This is crazy. Toni, come in. -Hi. -Hi. I came to give you this. What is it? I don't know. Félix gave it to me. Don't let your parents see it, eh? My brother's a mess. He's going to a hospital in Vitoria. I'm going with him to spend the night. How about that, man. Well, I'm off. Let's go. Bloody hell! Hey! Jeez, it weighs a ton. Put it down. There. -Holy shit. -Did Paquito see? -No! He's sleeping like a log. -Good. And you? All this fuss over the bike... Does your Galician friend still have that empty place? I don't know, I think so. Talk to her, maybe I can leave the bike there. I'll come tell you all about it, I promise. -I'll buy you breakfast. -Alright. -'Bye. Thanks. -You're welcome. Come on. Let's go, Marcos. You really don't want to take some days off? No. I think it'll do me good to come to the factory. Being at home is worse. Maybe in September. When things are bit more... ...more settled down, I'd like to take the lad somewhere for a few days, if that's alright. Count on it. How's he taking it? I don't think he's really taken it in yet. And neither have I. The main is that...you're alright... -No. -Jesús... On Saturday I want to see Marcos in the front row of the race. But, Luis Mari, with all the funeral expenses... No, no, forget the money. Marcos is on the team, end of story. And don't worry about the bike, I'll get you another one. Thanks. Have you seen Marcos? No, or his father. -Good luck, eh, lad? -Okay. -Go for it, eh? -Okay. Put some balls into it! STARTING LINE Let's go. SEPTEMBER -Paquito. -What? Do you know the hairdresser closed up the salón? Yes. My dad said they're gonna start up a fruit shop, or something. Fuck, that sucks. Where will they do your helmet now? Retard! Dry Turd! Tomorrow at school they're posting the catch-up exams marks. I know. I bet I flunk them all. My dad's gonna be... I did flunk. ¿Cómo lo sabes? Because I didn't go to the exams. Piss off! That's shit. And school again on Monday. -Shall we have a game? -Okay. But let's change teams. Paquito and Marcos, you and me, Toni. -Why? -Because you're a slacker, Paquito. Okay, but not so hard, I've got new lenses in my glasses. Don't be lazy! Let's go! Hey, lad, get ready to stop playing. 1, 2, 3, now! Now the race is real. You have to clean the colors on you window. Can you see clearly now? Welcome, son, to reality. Key in hand. Go in, son, don't knock. And never budge. Never budge! The world spins and when it falls it bites its tail. Why did you have to grow up? Goddamn the time! You have to win and make a mark, make an impression. You'll be amazed. You'll have to be better than the rest. You're so alone! My dearest son, my lad. The countdown. 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, now! The world spins and when it falls it bites its tail. Why did you have to grow up? Goddamn the time! Welcome to the club of those of us going to triumph. You'll give us the change later. You're worth it, lad! The world spins and when it falls it bites its tail. Why did you have to grow up? Goddamn the time! The world spins and when it falls it bites its tail. Why did you have to grow up? Goddamn the time! Translation: Lindsay Moxham Subtitles: LASERFILM
