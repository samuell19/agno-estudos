Diana Wardale is speaking. Please, play back. Hey Cybercop, talk to me. Are you there? I just wanted to let you know I'm thinking of you. I'm working late. Doing a few variations. Trying to make it a more powerful experience. I know you don't approve of this addiction. But I've made AfterLife so good. I have a secret, Carver. The Transcender. It's gonna change everything. But I'm not sure I want to hand it over to DreamCor. So I've hidden it. Take care, love. We'll talk in the morning. Good kill, player one. You receive the full bonus. Be careful player one. The enemy is near. Learning fast. I'm gonna make it this time. Player one. You've made it. You're on your way. Just pass the Grim Reaper. And you'll be there. An angel in Heaven. - I've won the game. Let me pass. Let me pass. Diana needed me and I couldn't see it. She was trying to win me back. Leaving tempting messages in the middle of the night. Well like a jerk, I bailed. The messages were becoming more desperate. I loved her. But she'd gone too far. Attention Carver. Attention Carver. DreamCor is reporting an energy overload. Where? - The lab. It's chaos time in cyberspace. My analysis is that Diana Wardale has spiked the energy grid. Again? I'm afraid so. Why can't she just start at the first level like everyone else? I can ask another DreamBreaker to handle this one. No, I'll take care of it. My name's Carver, I'm a DreamBreaker. I police the thin line between escape and addiction. DreamCor feeds our fantasies so we don't smell the stench of our own rotting souls. Sound confusing? It is. Come one, come all. Play the AfterLife. Excitement, stimulation. Arouse those primal instincts. Live because you know death is near. Strive for Heaven. The AfterLife Game. A most satisfying experience. Diana wanted more, and who could blame her? But she got trapped. The interface plugged right into the cerebral cortex. It's made DreamCor rich. So they keep the games coming and everyone plays. Because that's all that matters. The AfterLife Game. No! I'm dead! I'm dead! My turn! I'm on, I'm on, go! Stab her! Hyperspeed! Kill her, kill her! I'm off, blown out, zeroed. Dream it, you're drowning! These kids don't know fantasy anymore. They're way gone, they don't care. We're going to be killed. Ten years as a DreamBreaker and I'd never seen anything like it. Finally crime was a thing of the past. Everything happened in the game. I was too shocked to know what to feel. God I loved you. What were the circumstances surrounding your discovery of the body, Carver? I was answering a code yellow. I found her like this. Mortibund, my boss. DreamCor's answer to selective breeding. Diana's death meant nothing to him. And he meant nothing to me. Ironic, isn't it? The inventor of the AfterLife Game murdered while playing it. And such a violent crime, too. People just don't do this type of thing anymore. That's right. You were... close to the victim. Weren't you? Why would someone want to kill her? I don't know. This... is terrible. The Transcender is missing. The Transcender? It's gone. Thank God. I'd hidden the damn thing before they'd arrived. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. It's confirmed, Madam Stoller. The Transcender's gone. Who found her body? Carver. The Transcender was the only thing missing. I want it back, Mortibund. And I don't care what you have to do to get it. Understood. Diana Wardale. Born 2057. Acknowledged DreamLife genius and creator of AfterLife Game. We were happy before Diana hooked up, and Dodge was still around. Initiated early Transcender experiments with missing DreamCor developer Dodge Torbit. But things change. The game takes its toll. This is a model of the Wardale Transcender. Skip the noise. Show me what happened. This is the possible reconstruction of the Wardale murder. Based on the available data compiled at DreamCor science. I'm gonna make it this time. Again. I'm gonna make it this time. What's with that visual shift? An inconsistency occurred that cannot be defined. It is the result of a distortion within the AfterLife. That's strange. Where in the game? It appears to be a nomad encryption beyond regulation game parameters. Shall I advise DreamCor? No. DreamLife mode. Access code: 89 zero 82. DOA. I'm sorry Carver. That's a secure level in the AfterLife software. DreamBreaker override, code red. DreamBreaker voice recognition confirmed, Carver. Diana secured this space with a personal password. Do you know it? Heaven. Easy one, Carver. Access granted. Don't be afraid. Who are you? I'm Carver. I'm the angel program of AfterLife. Diana? Of course not. She modeled me after herself. But I'm different than her. I can't let you go any further. Wait. Your designer was my friend. I'm investigating her death. Diana's been murdered. For real. Murdered? Outside of the game? Look, I was hoping you could help me. I shouldn't have come here. I'm gonna leave you alone now. - Don't go. I don't know what happens outside of all this. I'm sorry, I have to go. I'm alone. No one ever makes it to this level. Stay with me. No, I can't. You're not real. I love you. Diana. A world of illusion. I've never felt it with so much power before. I wanted to stay. God it was good to be with her again. Madam Stoller wants to see you, Carver. She has some questions regarding the Transcender. Carver, are you going to report to Madam Stoller? I guess Diana couldn't resist playing God. Until I find out who killed my angel, the Transcender was safer with me. But with DreamCor after it, I wasn't safe. Carver, are you going to report to Madam Stoller? Carver? I'm waiting for an answer, Dr. Tesla. It's a basic rule of science, Madam Stoller. You can't produce something from nothing. The possibilities of DreamLife are... There are no possibilities. DreamLife is only illusion. It's nothing but a pacifier. That keeps mindless people from facing the inevitable. We all depend on that unreal world, Dr. Tesla. Yes. While this world runs out of everything necessary to sustain human life. In another generation, your illusion will come to an end. Permanently. The Transcender changes everything. Diana Wardale was on the verge of perfecting it. Diana Wardale was on the verge of nothing. Every previous attempt at transcending has failed and future attempts will also fail. My work, on the other hand, has proven what I have stated. The planet can no longer support life. Not life as we know it. The people need newer, better DreamLife experiences. We will continue to provide them. Judith. If it comes down to a choice to be or to pretend to be... What's his problem? Death in the real world isn't glamorous. And unlike the game, you don't get another chance. Diana had run out of lives and I was the only friend she had left. I was hoping that Dodge might have shown up. Seems like someone else was interested after all. I'd had a feeling I was being followed, and now I was sure. Death in a plastic wrapper. She lost the game. What happens after is anyone's guess. See the wonders of nature as they used to be with DreamCor was new and improved. Flight of the Phoenix. Thank you for tuning into Flight Time. A broad variety of destinations are available through your DreamLife retailer. You may disconnect now. SexLife. Forbidden fruits, large breasts and the milk of human kindness. When she says no, she means yes. And as an added feature, she has no rights. Time for gratuitous nudity and sex, sex, sex. So plug into SexLife and pander to your sickest, depraved desires. And afterwards, why not visit mother Earth as she used to be? Soar high above the Earth free as a bird. Check out Flight Time on DreamLife 49. I don't play the game, but sometimes it helps to alter things a bit now and then. Add some flavor to the swill. And hey, the earpieces is free. And then she walks in. The same girl that was at Diana's funeral. Beautiful in both worlds, she was still following me. There was something about her. What the hell is going on? I don't know. Stay down. There was only one way out of here, and I had to use it. I hope this works. Howdy folks, and welcome to the AfterLife Game. Prepare for the fight of your life. What the hell just happened? I think we got off at the wrong stop. Come on. We're in the AfterLife Game. I didn't plug into DreamLife. Everything is so real. How did we get here? I didn't plug into DreamLife. Answer me, Carver. We transcended here. Transcended? What are you talking about? This is real. Let's hide here while I fix this thing. What was that? I haven't got time to explain. Just stay down and keep quiet. We can't get hurt here. It's all computer-generated. This is just a stereotypical gang member from the 20th century. He can't really hurt us. They can't hurt you? It's not real. Come on, come on. Isn't this fun? Here on the courtyard you must kill all you can. With a knife, or a gun. Or a club. Or by hand. Take this. We're not DreamLifing. No, I told you. We're transcending. Everything's just as real as we are. Time to try another level. Transcending. It works. Who are you? - Stop touching me. Who are you? My name's Serena, who are you? You've been following me, haven't you? I didn't do anything. Why are you treating me this way? Because a friend of mine's been murdered, and now they're after me. She didn't know what was going on. We'll be all right. The effects wear off pretty quick. I was being too hard on her. Whatever happened in the bar, it was tied to Diana's death. I needed to find Dodge. And I had an idea where he'd gone. The Cellar. One of the last place to be free in this world. DreamBreakers aren't welcome or needed here. But if Dodge was hiding out from DreamCor, this is where he'd be. People down here had gone pure. Sworn off the games. And I've begun to wonder if it's the only place to break free of the addiction of the games. Welcome to the UnderWorld level of AfterLife. Don't let any creature near you. One touch and you're dead. And beware of the Outsider, my friends. Only a chop of the head will do. Nately, I need those energy drain reports. - Yes! Heads I win. Nately, I need those energy drain reports. And I need them now! Later. I'm moving on to the next level. Nately! This is game playing, Nately. Shut it down. What I'm doing here is important, Dr. Tesla. Of course it is. I think I can get to Heaven. Heaven? I don't think so. Heaven's where you want to be. In the arms of the angel. At the end of every rainbow there is a pot of gold, and at the end of every AfterLife Game is the angel. Soothe your pains. Calm your anxiety. Fight for her. If you don't play the game, you'll never know the reward. Don't be afraid. Dr. Tesla. What? Mortibund. What is it? More problems with the food recyclers? The Transcender works, Dr. Tesla. And we know who has it. I was being watched. I could feel it. I was taking a risk. But I had to find Dodge. I had to earn their trust. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, I don't want any trouble here. Then why'd you come down here, DreamBreaker? I'm looking for someone. I mean you people no harm. DreamCor never means any harm. We should kill him. He brought a computer down here. He wants to plug us in. We should kill him, right? We have to kill him. We have to kill him. - We should kill him. No! Show me where his heart is again. Wait! Hello, Carver. Dodge. Checking up on us puritans and technophobics? I'm looking for you. You haven't gone pure, have you? No, not yet. I had to put my faith in him. He was my last hope. Carver! I apologize for our manners. We don't get many visitors down here in the Cellar. So I'm sure you got a reason for coming down here, DreamBreaker. Diana. She's dead. She was murdered three days ago. She can't be dead. - It's true. I want to find out who did it and you're the only one I have to turn to. No. No. Dodge. When you worked with her, you were like her brother. You're the only one alive who knows DreamLife like she did. I don't touch that stuff anymore, Carver. That's why I left the shelter. Dodge? I won't lie to you. This is dangerous. Whoever killed her, he's after me. Because I have what they want now. Don't help him, Dodge. He's DreamCor. He's gonna get us plugged in. It's some kind of trick. No, Dodge. Clear out of here and move to the next camp. I'll join you later. Wait a second. Diana wasn't herself towards the end. He would have recognized it. AfterLife, all the time. DreamCor made the AfterLife addictive. I'm sure of it. Wouldn't surprise me. You can't win. The game learns from you as you play. DreamCor wanted something to keep everybody playing for a long time. Everyone wants to get to Heaven. I know Diana did. My God. Did she finally get that thing to work? Keep that damn thing away from me. She showed me how to use it. Have you used it? Only a few times. Does DreamCor know you have it? They do by now. It isn't possible. Are you sure it works? Yes. If that is true, it means we could... I must have it. Have you located Carver, yet? He's in the lower levels. Hiding. Every available security officer's looking for him. I want you down there, too. You want me go down to the lower levels? Yes. And don't come back without the Transcender. When DreamCor wants something, they get it. Not this time. She looks terrible. What the hell is she doing? Searching for more intense AfterLife. There it is. That's some kind of power surge. Now the computer can show us what happened before and what happened after, but it can't recreate that exact moment. Dodge? I know how you feel. I know that. Freeze the image. I warned her. Warned about what? The rift, Carver. The rift, it's why we gave up on the Transcender the first time. What's a rift? One of Hasline's theories. It's a side effect of transcending. An equal but opposite reaction. In theory, the rift is a bridge between our world and DreamLife. But it's unstable. Dangerous. Have a look at this. I was sitting in the beverage station, and boom. Suddenly all hell breaks loose. There it is. That's the rift. That's it? By using the Transcender, Diana created a rift. And you're saying something came through this rift? And killed her? Yes. So many things now seem possible. The Transcender is the miracle we've been waiting for. We can create all the things we need in cyberspace. Real food. Fresh water. We can program anything we want. We can recreate what we've lost. And even improve on it. No imperfections, no flaws. I've got so many ideas. I can't keep track of them all. Artificial laborers. Who can survive in the exterior world. They could stay behind and run the computers for us. While we live forever in DreamLife. We can. What are you talking about? Our planet is dying. So we should abandon it? That's your miracle? It's a way of surviving. - No! It's a different way of dying! Maybe for moral giant like you it is. You don't understand. - Yes I do understand. You want to diminish human existence to fantasy. My fantasies don't diminish me. If we can colonize DreamLife, we can live in our own heaven. Your heaven, not mine. We can live in our dreams. So we can ruin them too? Can't you understand? We can bring new life to this world. The real world, Judith. If we can go in to DreamLife, we can bring things out. Carver. Carver. I love you. I love you. Good morning. How's it going', Dodge? I think the rift opens wherever the Transcender is. Whether or not it's in use. But I don't know its cycle. Or where it originates. I mean, it might constantly moving from one DreamLife to another. So what's preventing it from opening right now? Luck. That's great. I've done all I can here. Carver! It's closing. I'd say the... rift originates in the AfterLife Game. Why couldn't it be in the SexLife game? These creatures aren't after you. They're after the Transcender. Don't move. Serena. - That's right, Carver. So, you were following me. No, I was following orders. That's all. I should have known you work for DreamCor. Everybody works for DreamCor. So do you. Now hand over the Transcender, Madam Stoller's waiting for it. I have signs of him in the Cellar. I'm very close to finding Carver. What makes you so sure he's still down there? I have every access tunnel guarded. There's no way he could have gotten by me. Then stay down there until you find him. Keep me updated on any further developments. Idiot. You are lucky, Carver. Your familiarity with the Transcender makes you useful to DreamCor. Serena will take you to see Dr. Tesla. You will answer all of his questions. What if I refuse? You won't. If you value Dodge's life, you'll cooperate. We need the Transcender working, Carver. Nothing else matters. What about the rift? What if it opens again? Don't worry about the rift. DreamCor will take care of it. DreamCor always gets what they want. But the last person I wanted to see was Tesla. Let's go. And Serena, there was something about the way she looked at me that made me want to forget. In order to survive in the exterior environment, an artificial worker must be able to process acids far beyond our capacities. It must be able to breathe carbon monoxide. Withstand ultraviolet bombardment. To go for long periods of time without rest or... Who is it? Serena, I have something for you. Is that it? Yes. Hello, Carver. Hello, father. Just like he always was. Hadn't seen my father in ten years, and he didn't give a damn. And anything coming through from DreamLife last only a few seconds? And then it dissipates. But does it go back into the system, or cease to exist. I have no idea. If you transcended into DreamLife and stayed too long, would you... dissipate? I never stayed long enough to find out. Hey look, I didn't invent this thing. Diana Wardale did. Serena, I need some time alone with Carver. Would you mind? I'll wait outside. This really is a most ingenious piece of work. A few design flaws, of course, but... Carver. We're on the verge of something wonderful. Diana started it? We could finish it for her. Just think of it, Carver. Plants. Trees. Delicious fruits. Potatoes, tomatoes, radishes. Radishes. We can make anything we want in DreamLife. We just to be able to bring it out. We could re-foliate our planet, Carver. I don't trust Computer. I'm not asking you to trust DreamCor. I'm asking you to trust me. Then close the rift. - Absolutely. Nothing unwanted can be allowed to get through. Carver, show me how it works. Take me somewhere. It's dangerous. The rift could open at any moment. - If what you've told me is correct, the rift isn't due to reopen for hours. You don't know that. That's just a guess. It's an educated guess. We've got plenty of time. Carver, take me somewhere. The first few times are a little rough. It's... it's a radish. Can't you feel how real that is? I'm going to have to taste it. I wouldn't do that. We can't bring anything back with us. It turns to dust. Who knows what that would do to your stomach. Wait. This is... You know where we are. This is how I remember her. I can't stay here. When you left, it broke her heart. You abandoned us. I can't change the past. But together, we can change the future. Why did you take me there? I thought you should see some of the other possibilities. The radish. It's turned to dust. But just a moment ago it seemed so real. Diana programmed that reality to demonstrate the Transcender to me. Was she... real? That woman was a manifestation of programmed information based on my memories. And if that programmed information were complete? Then she'd be... more real. The lab's ready for the Transcender, Dr. Tesla. Yes. Yes, in a moment. I'll take Carver. Like all of us, he lived in his own world. Haunted by his own ghosts. My dad, he dreams of a different world. A dream I couldn't share. We're keeping the Transcender in this chamber. It's totally secure. I doesn't work all the time. You've got to it. Play with me. So this is the way the world ends? There... science. Hi, Mortibund. Any luck finding Carver? He's around here somewhere. Take Carver to his compartment, Serena. Madam Stoller wants all the information about the Transcender purged from his computer. What the hell? Did you do this? No, it was Mortibund. Have you reported to Madam Stoller yet, Carver? Yes, I have. I'll come get you when you're finished purging your files. You should be honored. Dr. Tesla is a brilliant scientist. You should be excited about what we're accomplishing here. He's a lousy father. Yes, lots of men are. But survival is more important, Carver. The human race is in danger of extinction. Do you really think anyone will notice? Serena, tell Stoller I'll cooperate, but if she wants to get rid of the rift, she needs Dodge Torbit's help. He helped Diana design the Transcender. He's the genius. I'll see what I can do, Carver. Is it my fault he was a lousy father? Diana, I wish you were here. Hello, Carver. I'm over here. You didn't come back. I've been busy. You're thinking of someone else, weren't you. I'm not Diana. I'm better. You're not real. You could use the Transcender. You know about the Transcender? I know you've been using it. Make it real. Use the Transcender. You want me. I know you do. You're behaving differently than before. I'm a learning program of AfterLife. I'm always changing. Come to me. Has someone else been accessing your program? Jealous? Of course not. Come, don't be afraid. I can't, Diana's dead. But how do we maintain the equilibrium of the specimen outside of DreamLife? I'm sorry, but there is insufficient data to reach a conclusion. I need some inspiration. I know that your DreamLife access time has quadrupled in the last three days. Is this access integral to the research, Doctor? Doctor? DreamLife mode... access code... 89 zero 82: DOA. You will need the password for entry. Heaven. Time for your next lesson. Closer. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. Madam? I have the numbers you requested. Dr. Tesla's plans for re-foliation would in fact take much longer than previously estimated. How long? You would not live long enough to see it. Perhaps the next generation. Damn the next generation. The rift has opened at least three times. We know its cycle. I can predict with reasonable certainty that it won't reform until morning. Reasonable certainty? The easiest thing to do is just wait 'til it reforms, then deal with it. No, that's too dangerous. You don't know what comes through there. According to you. Why not just erase the AfterLife? Who is this guy? Erase the AfterLife and rift's no longer a problem. Nothing can get through because there won't be anything to get through. Well that could work. What if the rift is independent of the game? Who knows where it could end up, we might be... We can't erase AfterLife. Why are we listening to him? He was living in the Cellar. Let's be realistic. The AfterLife is our most important DreamLife. We are not erasing it. Everyone plays it. But now it's playing you. You are wasting my time. Get him out of here. DreamCor doesn't listen to reason, Carver. They never have and they never will! I keep telling you we have until morning. What difference does that make? We shouldn't do anything rash. We hold in our hands the meaning... I am tired of all of this talk. Now the rift has to be dealt with, Dr. Tesla. So deal with it. No! Open this door! Open this door! - Open the door! We gotta get them out of there. Open the door. Open the door! Open the door! It's an Outsider. From the Underworld level. Tesla. What are you doing? This is our chance to erase the rift! I have the coordinates. Come on, hurry up! Hurry! Faster! - I'm doing it! Come on! You gotta do it faster, man! I'm erasing it. Serena! Carver! Carver? Carver, can you hear me? Carver. When I came to, all I could remember was that look in Serena's eyes. I want the AfterLife monitored for the next 48 hours. We need to be sure. Serena, see that Carver's wounds are cleaned thoroughly. Who knows what viruses he may have been exposed to. And... good work, people. That hurt. Sorry. I'm scared. So am I. In this world, love is rare. I felt lucky. Diana was the real thing. Someone to care about. Someone to hold onto. We've been monitoring. AfterLife for two days now. The rift is gone. Any other progress? - Yes. We should be finished creating our own rift within a few days. One we control, I hope. Of course. I'll be much more stable. People and objects will be able to go in and come out for protracted periods without dissipating. And I've almost finished designing my prototype artificial laborer. I call him Adam. Once we bring it through we can put it to work in the exterior environment without life support. I want to show the inhabitants the potential of transcending. A demonstration. Something... simple but inspirational. I can do that. A small tree, perhaps. Or a computer-generated radish. Would you like a radish? Is there something you're not telling me? Thomas. The projections show that re-foliation is an unlikely solution to our current problems. It would just take too long. It wouldn't even happen in our lifetime. How can I justify that to the people? Their standard of living would keep dropping. They'd have to keep doing without. We'd all have to do without. It would just be too hard. We have to be prepared to make these kind of short-term sacrifices. For the sake of the future. Whose future? Our grandchildren's? We need an immediate solution. No matter how successful your demonstration is, I'm going to announce that a mass exodus to DreamLife will be our ultimate salvation. Your artificial workers can stay behind and run the computers for us after we're gone. But with our rift, we could... The demonstration will occur three days from now. You have a lot of work to do. I suggest you get busy. Your artificial laborer, Dr. Tesla. Delete it. That instruction cannot be reversed. Are you sure you want to... Delete it. If we cannot survive on this planet, I will bring something here that can. Something better than us. Don't talk to me about questionable decisions. My kind has rendered out own planet uninhabitable. How could any race be so stupid? Biological organisms offer a variety of behavioral possibilities. We're parasites. Time to leave this poor world to a better breed. And the sooner the better. Activating Angel program. Increasing program parameters. Mankind does not deserve to survive. By increasing program parameters we run the risk of overloading shelter stations. Safe asylums will be affected. All Games will be affected. Do you still go Dreamlifing? Why would I want to do that? We better get going. Stoller will be unveiling the transcending gate soon. Do you think they'll give Diana any credit for it? No. Unless they want to admit how she died. What do you mean? I don't think DreamCor wants anyone to know that their great new invention has caused the deaths of a dozen people. Including the inventor. You go ahead. I'll meet you there, okay? Carver? What? Nothing. This is the new future we're working on here, people. This the gateway to the future. Where's Carver? Things just weren't adding up. So I went over it again. But something was different this time. Very different. What the hell? What happened that time? New information from within the AfterLife Game has created an alternate scenario. What level? The information came from the Hell level in the AfterLife Game. It was time to go to Hell. Welcome to Hell, player one. Are you ready for the fight of your life? Survive this level and you're well on your way to... Heaven. You can't see what you happens. It's time to tune into your senses. The demons are waiting for you. Is it you, Carver? Is it you? Diana? What's left of her? The following is a very special announcement from. Madam Stoller. Inhabitants of Shelter 22. This is a landmark day in our great history. Today, DreamCor brings new hope to you, winter children. All your dreams are about to come true. Prepare to get to Heaven with DreamCor. Diana, are you real? A kind of. But I'm not who I was. I'm dead. I'm not dead. I'm in Hell. Diana. Diana! DreamCor has always been proud of the opportunity to bring you the best and most satisfying life our great technological advancement can achieve. One small step for DreamCor, one giant leap for human kind. We're all going to get what we deserve. The violence, Carver. All this blood. It changes a woman. I'm sorry. I think, I think I'm crazy. No you're not. You're not crazy. What are you saying? You're a DreamLife genius. Everybody says so. Sometimes you even think. I Should be. I'm honored to present to you the inventor of the 22nd century, Dr. Thomas Tesla. And his miraculous transcending gate. Madam Stoller has spoken of a great human achievement who to allow you to distance ourselves further from the harsh nature of this world. DreamCor believes that your future lives within the safety of DreamLife. I suspect most of you believe in this, too. But I do not. I believe in another future. A future that is... physical. A future that is... real. Diana, what happened to you? The Angel. She came through the rift. She thought it was part of the game, so she killed me. Now I'm trapped here, I can't really die. And I can't get to Heaven. No one gets to Heaven. It's the way I designed the goddamned game! Carver. You've got to stop him. Stop who? Your father. You aren't the only one who's been accessing him, Carver? I bring you a new kind of hope. A new beginning through the arrival of a new human. A better human. Something's coming out. Diana? Dodge, close it. Close it now! How perfect. Please, say something. Parasites. Stay away from me! Hurry. It's almost too late. I have the Transcender. I can take you out of here. No, Carver. I'm gone. Do you understand me? I'm gone. Hurry. Diana! What happened? Dodge? Dodge? Serena? Serena? What have you done? I can't hear you. A Weeded garden going to seed. No, not again. I don't want this to happen. You were too late, Carver. She's got Serena. - Where? Where do you think? In the AfterLife. You'll have to kill her, Carver. But its' got to be real. No more DreamLife invading. Real! That was Diana. Wasn't it? Her consciousness is trapped in the AfterLife Game. She's insane. Due to technical difficulties, we can't allow you to watch your leadership unravel. All vital systems are failing. Air quality is dropping. Computer. Adjust systems to acceptable levels immediately. Computer! Environmental systems are failing. External atmosphere is entering ventilation system. It's the Angel. She's controlling our computers from inside the game. She's shutting down our life support systems. All she has to do is wait for us to die. What can we do? What can we do? You heard what Diana said. We have to go into the game. I'm programming the Transcender to bring us back here in case we can't get back through the gate. Now the Angel could be anywhere in there. What happens if we stay in there too long? We won't be able to come back. The Shelter has 20 minutes of acceptable air left. After that, there'll be no point in coming back. I'm ready. Let's do it. What good will that do? We have to go in there for real. If I'm Dreaming, I can keep tabs on you and nothing can happen to me. That's great. That's just great. Attention all inhabitants. Air quality is partly contained. Estimated 18 minutes to the first human fatalities. First level, Human Nature. I'm no good at this game. Well you better get good. Come on. Prepare for the fight of your life, people. Choose your weapons and get ready to die. All I wanted to do now was find Serena and get her out. But that meant facing the Angel. I wasn't about to fail again. Diana. Wait, you can guide us. You know the game better than anyone. I don't like your friend. We can't trust her. Who's side is she on? Shut up, Stoller. You're just DreamLife. You're no good for anything. And what are you? You're just part of the game now. You're a freak. A computer glitch. Diana's dead. Dead. - Shut up! Shut up! This is crazy. I'm crazy! Didn't you hear? We have to find Serena and the angel. We have to play the game. This isn't a game. - It is to Stoller. She's a fake. But you, on the other hand, are real. I'm gonna blow your head off. Diana, don't do this. Ironic isn't it? People just don't do violent things anymore. Do they? Stop. We've got 17 minutes left, are you gonna help us or not? Okay, follow me. Why is it so quiet? They're waiting for you. I don't trust her. I don't trust either of you. Attention, environments systems failure in 15 minutes. Isn't this fun? Here in the courtyard you must kill all you can with a knife. Or by hand. How about that? Very good, player six. Exciting, isn't it? Shut up. Take us to the next level. Real Life. This way? - No Carver. That way! Remember my friends. All is not as it seems. Life is but a dream. What was here is now gone. What was gone... Carver! Serena! Serena? Carver. Why'd you leave me? I need you. Please. - Serena? Angels learn from you, you care! You stupid bastard. That's why you'll lose the game. Now stay close. I know a shortcut to the Underworld. What happened to the others? Forget about them! They're dead! And if they're not dead, they will be soon. Attention, environmental systems failure in 13 minutes. We have to catch up to Carver. He has the Transcender. Hold your fire. What are we shooting at? There's nothing there. I thought I saw the Angel. Get hold of yourself. Which way do we go? This way. We've got to keep moving. All systems are failing. Except for DreamLife. I'm running out of air. Attention. Air quality and power systems continue to deteriorate. Game players may experience slow reaction times. Hey players, things may seem strange. Even a bit deranged. AfterLife is slowed due to a power drain. Don't worry though, all of the action is still yours to behold. Game players. They'll try and kill us. The shelter's running out of air. They're still playing AfterLife. Let's take them out. I'm out of bullets. Beautiful. Hey! Amateurs. My dear friends, you seem to be moving in circles. Dammit, Mortibund. Can't you do anything right? It's a bloody maze. We've got ten minutes. Ten minutes. Mortibund. Attention. Environmental systems failure in ten minutes. My dear friends. Welcome to the Conflict. Nice play close to my heart. If I had one. The key is to avoid the touch of the zombies. Or you will fry. Fry. It's okay. I'm in the lab. I'm afraid your friends have been eliminated. You, however, are a lucky boy. You've made it to the next level. Welcome to the Underworld level of the AfterLife Game. Be very careful where you step. It could be your last. Attention, game players should continue to expect inconsistent rendering and faulty weaponry due to power shortage. Hey look, it's Dodge. Dodge? Dodge? This way, Carver. You too, Mortibund. I'll take you to Serena. Dodge? Dodge? It's me, Carver. I'm fine. - Shoot him. This way, Carver. Shoot him. - Shut up! I won't... Come on. We got seven minutes left. Mortibund get down! You could have shot me. The Angel. We have to get the Angel! We have to stop meeting like this. You were killed. Only the Angel can kill me. Back Carver! Get to Heaven. I'll hold them off as long as I can. I hate this level! I always have to do this. I made it through Hell. I won the game. Let me pass. Me too. Patience, patience. You can trust Death. Go on. Enter Heaven. Meet the Angel. You deserve the reward. Go on. Bye bye. No! You too, Carver. The Angel wants you. Diana wants you. You're a special guest in Heaven. Mom? Mom? We knew you'd come sooner or later. I was wrong, son. It is better here in DreamLife. Much better. I'm running out of time! I have to get to Heaven! What do you think this is? It's not real. You're almost to Heaven, Carver. Where is she? Where's Serena? No! You're not Serena, you're not. You'd kill me, Carver? You'd kill your angel? Wait. Me first. My brave creator. You almost made it to Heaven. I hurt. There, there. There, there. You're mine, Carver. Now and forever. Humanity does not deserve to survive. You're nothing but parasites. You've ruined your own planet. It's time for a better breed to take over. Is that what you think? It's my programming. Who programmed you? Your father. And Diana. Parasites. What do they know? You're better than they are. The programmed me. With their own motives. Not yours. False information. I must talk to my creators. You can't. You killed them. You're trying to confuse me! Think for yourself, Angel. Remember? The first time I came to see you? Remember what you told me? What you said to me? I love you. Have I done bad things? It's not too late to stop this. You can change. I'm sorry. Don't be afraid. Bitch! I'm going to kill you! Angel, no! Serena, look out! Diana. And then it was over. Just like that. The Angel. Diana. All dust. Carver. You did it. We're alive. We're alive. But Serena is trapped in the game. Carver! Serena. She's still in the game. That was ten long years ago. I have continued Diana and my father's work. But it's slow and frustrating. There must be a way to make real the intimacy that strokes the heart and electrifies the soul. This is now my life's work. And Serena. She's my ally on the other side. My life remains a walking shadow. Aren't you supposed to be working? I needed a break. Thought I'd visit you, see how you're doing. That's nice of you. It is awfully nice here. It's Heaven. It's not real, Serena. It is for me. Serena. You just feel that way because you've been trapped here for so long. But I will get you out. I will find a way to bring you back to reality. If it's the last thing I do. That's okay, Carver. Take your time.
