So, it won't open after all? Yes. I can't do it by myself, as I've already told you before. Two Grails will soon be collected. Just get ready for when our prey... Can you even hold out until then... Brother? NAMELESS GIRL It's snowing! Such beautiful snow! I'm the first to walk on it! Tanaka will also put footprints down! Jeez, they're always like this. They do say that kids are all "Children of the Snow". It's "Children of the Wind", Nee-san. It's pretty amazing, how much snow has accumulated. It's because it snowed a lot last night. Last night... Onii-chan... Shirou san's story was incredible. Hearing his story and being able to see him again like this made me really happy. Although, I don't think think Onii-chan wanted me to return to this world. Well, I guess that's how things ended up. What are you doing, looking all melancholic? Want me to teach you how to play with snow? Listen here, Kuro. Playing a kids' game... In this situa... Is not the right thing t... Especially at someone else's house. Um, Illya... Now you've done it! As I thought, it turned as expected. This gives such a nostalgic feeling, indeed. Indeed, indeed. We're back. Welcome back. Wait, what happened to you? Well... I think we... overdid just a little bit...? We sure did! Go change before you catch a cold! Okay. Wait, Angelica. Yes. Where are you going? To change clothes, in according with your order. I wasn't talking to you. You can sit back down. Understood. Thoroughly like a doll, huh. Seeing Miyu in a skirt is so refreshing. I always wore one as part of the school uniform, though... School uniforms are different. Very good! Very good! Lively girls in brand new clothes, a sight that melts my heart! These clothes... A little something I've prepared for them. As ladies, you should care about how you dress. I don't need a change of clothes. I'm fine with a normal shirt and a pair of pants. My! A lady shouldn't be careless about her fashion. Maybe you should wear clothes more suitable for combat for once. - My fashion is most suitable for combat. - You really don't have any skirts? - What's the problem with the way I dress? - I should lend you some of mine then. - Wanna get punched? - Thank you. Tanaka-san? What's the matter, Tanaka-san? You don't like your new clothes? Or do you want to play in the snow some more? She's there... Tanaka-san, where are you...? Geez! Where did Illya go? She was here just a second ago. It seems that Tanaka as well... For Illya, I saw her leave just now. Wait, she didn't go outside, did she? Would that be bad? Yeah. The Ainsworths only made a temporary retreat. We don't know when they might attack us again. Without Ruby, the risk is that much higher for her. I'll go find her. I'll go too. The school...? Tanaka-san, are you alright? Running off all of a sudden without saying anything... Is there something in the school you wanted to... Erika-chan...? Um, it's Erika-chan, right? I see, that's my name. Yes, first on the attendance list, Erika Ainsworth. What are you doing here...? You're asking for my reason? There hasn't been one. Not for a long time. What are you saying...? Erika-chan. I want to ask you about something. What is Julian planning to do with that black box thing? I know that he wants to save the world, but... That's not all there's to it. Could it be that Julian's true wish... - is for you to be save... - Hey, Illya Onee-chan. What is it? Will you save me then? I'll save you! I've decided to seek a path where everyone is saved! How very much like you, Illya Onee-chan! So Kind! Let's see, well then... Will you kill me? You said you'd save me, right? Then go ahead, open the pithos, and kill me. Open it, and kill you? If you do that, then maybe everyone would die. But you'll do something about that, right? Illya... Where are you...? I've come to get you, our precious, precious princess. The other one isn't here, I see. Well, it doesn't matter. My first priority is to secure the Grail. Let's return, Illya-san. Ah, yes. You actually think you can win with something like that. That joke is actually funny. It seems that normal spells won't do much. Then I gotta thank you for making me laugh. Against the power of the Divine Spirit you're using, a normal human cannot win. Son of a... If it's divine power you're using, then this Heroic Spirit... This Berserker can fight back. Very interesting. Then let's see how long... you can keep this up! Please be careful, Miyu-sama. This power can't be used for long battles. Indeed... You can undoubtedly say that this one has comparable strength. However... Let's see you withstand this one. I know all about it. That card was mine to use. The greatest hero in Greek mythology, Heracles Its capabilities were amazing. Yes, they really were. Until I got this card, that is. I overdid it a bit. Miyu-sama, are you alright? Yes, this body seems highly durable. Miyu-sama?! We ran out of time, Miyu-Sama! What's that, you reached your limit already? Then I'll do you a favor and finish this quickly. Trace on. Miyu! You okay? Kuro. Onii-chan. We'll buy you time. Run, Miyu. Well, this just got much more fun... Like hell I'll let her escape! The Seven Rings that Cover the Burning Heavens How long can your body hol... Hey you! Onii-chan! Interesting. I'll crush you both in one strike... Displacement Magecraft? Julian... Return. Be thankful. Your lives were just saved, you bastards. Looks like she's gone for now. Yeah... Miyu! Kuro! Shirou-san! Are you alright? I'm fine. Me too, somehow. I'm alright too. I'm not injured. Thank goodness you're all okay. Illya-san, I'm here too! Oh, so you're here, Ruby. Isn't that response a little too cruel? Of course not, Ruby. I'm so glad you're safe as well, yes. What about you, Illya? Did something happen? Illya? Actually, when I went after Tanaka-san to the school... I met Erika. She wants to die? Julian's little sister said something like that? For a wish like that, she speaks as if it's not something she can do herself. I didn't understand what she was saying either... Did she mention anything else? Kill me. "If you want to save me, open it, and kill me." By "open it", you mean... I don't know... Not very reliable, are you. But I didn't understand a word she was saying. Now that I think about it, back then... I just need to do my best to open the Pithos. ...is what Erika said. Did she say anything else? Seomthing else? Well... Gilgamesh called her the "Mud Doll of Calamity". Rin-san? Luvia san? A black box floating over the skies that was called a "Pithos" Erika being called the "Mud Doll of Calamity"... And a box that contains the "Hope" to save the world... There's at least a possibility. Indeed. What have you been talking about? You've heard of "Pandora", right? Yes, of course. I know a bit about her too. Then, if Pandora became a Heroic Spirit... what would her Noble Phantasm be? It has to be that, right? Pandora's Box... That's correct. Opening the box out of curiosity, all evil and despair came flying out and when she shut the lid, the only thing that still remained in the box is Hope, Elpis. In doing so, the box became a better Holy Grail than the Holy Grail itself. If it's a wishing device made by deities from the Age of Gods, then... If it was made by the gods, then it may be able to grant any wish, no matter how big. There's no way such a ridiculous Noble Phantasm exists. Seems like you've realized it. We've witnessed that Noble Phantasm ourselves. And we know how it'll be used. It's exactly the power the Ainsworths desired. Could it be... That's right. The Ainsworths pulled Pandora's Box from the past via the card, and they're making Erika use it. But in that case, why is the box spewing all of that corrupted mud? If they're opening it, there should only be "Hope" in there, right? That's the strange part... Yeah. Sorry. I didn't want to interrupt what you were discussing, but... What's "Pandora's Box"? I don't know either. Right, I guess some people wouldn't know. Padnora was a maiden created by the gods and... Uh no, I know who Pandora is. She's from Greek myth, correct? What I don't know is just "Pandora's Box". You don't know such a famous story? Even though you know about Pandora herself? Yeah. All I know from the Greek Myths books I've read is that Pandora is a human created by the gods. What do you mean? Knowing just that part is strange. They know about Pandora, but not about Pandora's box. But that means... It can't be... What came out of the box, mud and Heroic Spirits, are more suitable to be called "Despair". If the thing that's in the box isn't "Hope", but "Despair"... Then in this world... Pandora's Box was never opened! Who allowed you to act on your own? You're not good at treating ladies, huh? Leave. Where did you go? I went for a walk to school. Why? Who knows. If I had to come up with a reason... Then it'd be for the same reason why you still wear your school uniform. How does that sound? Listen... I'll open the Pithos for sure, so you... So you shouldn't try and do anything foolish. Erika. Soon... Soon, my legend will be complete. Death and rebirth... You and I shall write a new chapter in human history. In this world, Pandora's Box wasn't opened? So, Julian's objective is to open Pandora's box? If this hypothesis is correct, that is. That's absurd! What will happen, if that's the case? What came out of that box was called "despair", if something like that is opened in this era... And that's without factoring the power it's been accumulating for so many years... I don't even want to think what would happen if it were to open now. No way... Why would Julian want to do something like that? "To save the world", is what he said... But to unleash such despair for that? The Ainsworth's wish is the salvation of mankind. However, saving the entirety of mankind is not an easy wish. So, in short... To save humanity, sacrifices must be made, is that what you're saying? Yes. What's with that ridiculous reasoning? But... I can't say I don't understand. In fact, speaking as a mage, I would say they made the correct decision. Agreed. How? Because this world will end if nothing is done about it. And so, in order to save humanity, if it's necessary to make sacrifices, it's still a better option than allowing complete extinction. That's... No. You're wrong. Sacrificing someone to save someone else... I wish for everyone to be happy. That's right. Yeah, Illya is always like this. Like what? Then, it's decided that we'll stop Julain. Indeed. In that case, our next agenda would be our plan from now on. To find out the things we can actually do here. And I want to confirm what we absolutely cannot do as well. This means it's Tanaka's turn, right? Yes, yes, now please be quiet over there. The way Tanaka is being treated is so cruel! I don't wanna be quiet... So, if anyone has something to say... Um, then... There's something I want to request. I don't want Shirou-san to fight anymore. Whate are you talking about? I can still... I second that as well. So long I'm by your side, I won't allow you to engage in any life-threatening battles. You must be aware of it by now. The more you use that Heroic Spirit's power, the more it'll consume your body. If this goes on, you won't be yourself anymore. But... Onii-chan, you know... I experienced lots of things in the other world. I didn't know of many things, so I failed a lot of times too. I realize now that I've made it here with the help of many different kinds of people. Even for someone like myself... for the first time... I'm finally thinking about protecting someone in my life. Now I know things like how much Onii-chan wants to protect me... and also about how hard it is for you to do so. Because you became my Onii-chan, I finally became who I am. That's why... It's my turn now. I understand. OK next, about the battle strategy against Beatrice... Do you have a plan in mind? Yes. Let's talk about that card. Sorry for waking you up. I'm going to the toilet... I see. Can't sleep? Or is it that you don't have a sleep function? If you order me to sleep, I shall sleep at once. Angelica... You really became like a doll. There's no more need to perform. So even that anger was fake. What a shame. Your enraged face was the spitting image of his. Truly... Truly the same. That's how I realized. You're Julian's older sister, right? So, you found out. Magecraft is passed down through the bloodline. There's no way someone this skilled in spacial displacement wouldn't be an Ainsworth. However, you're no longer human. I'm a doll. A doll harboring someone's consciousness that cannot return to their body. Every single one of the dolls I fought was broken. Amorality from muddled memories... Rampaging wile ignoring injuries... Deteriorated language capabilities... The state you're in is instead something like a loss of emotions. Yes. In my case, more than 90% of my emotions were lost. I've learned to imitate human-like emotions. But in the end, it's all fake. There's no value to a doll's contents. It can't be... So, eavesdropping is your hobby? Um, this is... No, it's okay. You have the right to listen. You said you would save the world, Miyu and all people in this world. If so, then you don't know... the secret that the Ainsworths are hiding. A thickly coated fabrication. Hey, just who is Darius? Julian's true father was a man named Zachary, I was told. Then who is Darius? Darius-sama is the Allfather of the Ainsworth. As succession, every Ainsworth heir is replaced by Darius Ainsworth himself. That's the Ainsworth family's continuous tradition hailing from the first generation. By Darius, Julian will... The advertised goal is world salvation. However... No one knows the true wish of Darius-sama, who has lived for a thousand years. That's why... While his consciousness still remains, Julian is trying to grant a wish. Not for Darius's sake... but for that child's... Angelica-san... Please, I beg of you... Save my little brother. Well? I don't know. It's enormous. In any case, be careful. If anything happens, report it, regardless of how insignificant it is. Yes! Has any of them shown up yet? We may have lost the initiative here. Even so, we'll still do everything we can. Yup, Yup! You lot are the useless dolls that can't contribute in the battlefield. We're counting on you to at least provide phone technical support. No matter what the situation is, this stick continues to spite us! Is the video feed alright, Luvia-sama? The signal is perfect, Sapphire. Using the stick as a type of long-communication device. I see it doesn't lose to modern machines, huh? Rin-san, over there. When did she...? First, let's have a shot. Ready for the opening firework? Mjölnir! All-Crushing Hammer of the Thunder God Kuro! Bazett-san! We weren't hit. So you showed up, Beatrice. I missed on purpose. It'd be boring if it all ended on the first strike anyways. Illya, Miyu, engage her as planned. Wait. There's something behind Beatrice. Stairs? No... a bridge? That's... Julian! It's starting, Erika. Right here and now... End my legend. This is bad, the mud is... If this goes on, they'll come out again. Kuro. Miyu. You go on ahead first. Huh? Then what about you? I'll stay here to stop Beatrice. If so, let's face her together. Then we'll never make it in time. I agree as well. The only one who can win against something like that is Illyasviel, that much we've agreed on before. But you don't need to worry. It's hard to call it perfect, but there are sufficient countermeasures. Illyasviel and I will take care of her. "Take care of me," huh? The brat who kept running away from me and some muscle lady will take care of me? For taking such an unfunny joke so far, I can't help but end up laughing. Go! Don't lose, Illya. Finish her up quickly and catch up with us. Struggle all you want. That's what our role is supposed to be, after all. Come and face me, you worthless trash. Beatrice. What are you fighting for? I want to know the truth. I'm here to find out, not to fight. Nonsense. I'm just fighting for Julian-sama, that's my reason. I don't need any other one! They let us through too easily. I guess that means we'll be facing someone else. Kuro, in front of you! This sword! Yes... okay... I understand. There's no problem, of course. Just what are you talking about, Senpai? How could I refuse a request from you? Leave it to me. I do have a little bit of confidence with kitchen cutlery, after all. You... These two... I just have to cook them both, right? Matou... Sakura! They came into contact with the enemy. How's it going over there? They're both doing their best, but it's not looking good. And to think this has just started. Things going according to plan won't be easy, it seems. The one she'll use is the Berserker card. Due to its disadvantage of gradual loss of sanity for the user, we've added an automatically activated Code. After 10 minutes, it'll forcibly be ejected. We've created the strategy and have a good idea of where the weak spots are. Time is the most critical aspect. Illya... Yes, we don't have any other choice but to use it. The one Angelica told us about, Berserker's special feature... Overwrite! Installing another card on top is allowed. And in doing so, the new card will inherit the class. This unpleasant feeling is... If a Hero won't do... A Monster will! I've gotten a new kitchen knife again. Don't hold back, grab as much as you want. Sakura... Since you're a wraith and I'm a living spirit... I'll save you! Oh crap... I'll gut you. That was close! I was at my limit there! On holding my breath, I mean. What did you do? What did you do to me? Even if you're a Heroic Spirit who can take control of any weapon, You can't take away poison! Oh, interesting. I'm going to crush you, you snake piece of shit. Bazett-san! Don't think you can stop me with something like that! Are you serious? Ruby! Take this! Mjölnir! I won't let you! Aiming for my right arm? Don't look down on me! What a person! Shooting her own lighting at herself! It's melting... My mind is melting away. What are you fighting for? Do not invade my mind! Illya! You don't have much time before the forced ejection! Hurry up and follow the plan! Yes! I'll take you down right now! Fourth step! Damn you! Fifth step! Seventh step! Just one remaining! She did it! That's nine steps backwards! According to the myth, after Thor got poisoned by the serpent, he walked nine steps backwards and fell dead. If we reenact that myth, then surely... My divine core is telling me... "Don't retreat", "Don't stop", "Push forward". "Retreat is unforgivable!" Just "Go forward"! That's what my father is telling me! Her father?! No effect! The plan failed, Illya-san! No running away! The real Mjölnir... And what she said about her "father"... That can't be... But that means this Heroic Spirit is... Thor had two sons who inherited Mjölnir. Among the two, there was only one whose strength rivaled gods. The half-god, half giant: Magni! Now, enough playing around. Time to die. You're okay with that, right? No, you can't! Not yet! Poison...? How... filthy... Filthy! Filthy! Filthy! I have to clean it up. They were deflected? But they weren't stolen! Now I can pin her down! Crap... This thing is my worst enemy. Kuro! Lovely! I wish senpai could see this... Before they die out... These falling... ...cherry blossoms. The spot that was hit just now, the poison was absorbed from it? What in the world is she? Well, to put it simply, we need to defeat her without touching those things. If that's the case, the only way to break through is... Assassin: Uninclude. I'll use a magical energy canon. That's the only way, I guess. Using high-density output to force a way in is a magical girl specialty. That's right. You're Senpai's little sister, right? Now I remember... I was told that only you shouldn't be killed. But it's great, isn't it? Little sisters are always cared for by older brothers. Siblings are a wonderful thing. So jealous. So envious. Cutting one or two arms and legs off should be fine, right? I wish I got to know you earlier. If we did, I'm sure we... could've been friends. No problem! Maximal Schneiden! Thanks, Miyu. With this, the path is clear! Even this copy of mine can still cut a Heroic Spirit binding! Oh no... This dagger, to me... is a death sentence. You're okay with that, right? No. Don't. This isn't over yet. I still... haven't saved you yet! You stubborn little...! I'm sorry, Illyasviel. Your wish can't come true. Beatrice is beyond saving. MJÖLNIR! Roaring Storm of the Thunder God Answerer. Stop it, Bazett-san! Fragarach! That Which Comes Later Cuts First What would Illya have done? Illya, who's kinder and stronger than anyone else, could probably save Sakura-san as well. I am sorry. Gáe Bolg! Barbed Spear that Pierces with Death It missed? Impossible! Wait... This person... doesn't even have a heart? No, it hurts. It hurts. Senpai. Save me... Please save me... "Enemy down", it's fine to put it this way, right? Maybe, but we shouldn't let our guard down. What's that? Isn't that where Illya is fighting? We'll go first then, Kuro. Wait, is it okay to leave them? It's fine. I see. That's right... Illya will save everyone. Hey, Julian-kun. If it's for your sake... I wouldn't mind dying a second time. Is this... love, I wonder? What is happening? Most likely... The Heroic Spirit Magni had Thor's divine core. That's the one my attack hit. In other words... Magni always had two divine cores. If we stay put, we win this. Why? Although she escaped death, she lost the Authority to wield Mjölnir and be Thor and expectedly lost control. Since that's the case, we only need to wait until she self-destructs. Wait for her self-destruction? Tears? What was with that vision? You saw it too, Bazett-san? Again? It it some kind of mental interference attack? No, it's not. That's not an attack. That lightning... ...is Beatrice's memories! Illyasviel? Illya-san? I can't just sit here and wait. If that lightning is memories... Then by the end... There will be no memory left of her. What are you fighting for? I'm just fighting for Julian-sama. Those words really came from Beatrice's heart. She really did fight just for that reason. And now she will lose even that one purpose. No. Don't. Please, not yet... Just give me a little more strength. Berserker! Julian-kun. Julian-kun. Julian-kun. This may be the last chance. Do you have something you want to say? Julian-kun, I... What? At that time, I... What was I trying to say again? Damn it! Damn it! Julian-kun, it's fine already... Shut up! If you want to give up, keep that to yourself! I don't care about you giving up! I'm going to pull you out of there. And get you into a hospital as fast as possible! Julian-kun... I really loved... It was the same thing... The same thing I wanted to say then... That I loved you so much. Your feelings... Don't let them fade again...! That's why... Good night. Julian-kun... I can't believe she had something like forced card-ejection applied to me. Really, it makes me angry... Why are you the one crying? Because... You saw it, didn't you? The moment of my death... and the most important thing I forgot. When a human's concept is displaced, they'll, for sure, lose something. Be it intellect, one of the senses, or emotions... What? It's Julian-kun, right? What I lost was my memory... What happened? And... When I look at you, why do I not feel anything? My love for Julian-kun. Tell me again! What are you fighting for? You know, you're way too good at hitting right where it hurts. Even though you know why, you're still going to ask? That's right! It was a lie when I said it was for Julian-kun's sake! There was no trace of the feelings I had for him five years ago! All gone! I never had a reason to fight from the start! Because I'm a disposable hollow doll! That too... is a lie, right? Julian-kun, I... What is it? No, it's nothing. In the end, I couldn't say it. Because I didn't believe in it... Because I didn't believe whether my feelings were "real". I know. You lost your love. Even so... Over the next few years... You came to love that same person once again. I see. So you lost, Beatrice. Please hurry, Illya-san, Miyu-san and Kuro-san will soon be in contact with Julian. Illya. Can you hear me, Illya? Rin-san? Thank goodness, you sound like you're safe. I got worried when the connection broke. What's happening over there? What happened with Beatrice? We won. What Julian and the Ainsworths are fighting for... We still don't know the real reason. That's why I want to talk with him. Maybe I can find a way to end this battle without fighting. That's much too naive, Illyasviel. That kind of mentality won't... That's certainly true, but Illya has overcame many predicaments with that naivety. You are free to act as you wish. Thank you, Rin-san. But make sure you're prepared... Make sure you don't lose sight of what is truly important. To save something, you must sacrifice something. There will surely come a time when you'll need to make that... Rin-san? Even so, I... What will you do? Nothing. Nothing has changed. You just go watch them. What needs to be done remains the same. Same as back then... In a few days, father will be completely replaced by Darious-sama, apparently. It still hasn't sunken in for me yet, Emilia Nee-san. You seem discontent. Not really. It's just... I still have never succeeded at this yet. At least if I succeeded to do it, I wanted father to see it Well, not like it matters. But you still don't plan on giving up, right? That part of you is very similar to him. I'm not the next head of the family, and I don't have the talent for Magecraft either. But I think it's better this way. Even if I'm incompetent... Even if there's no meaning it it, I can continue to grow through my own efforts. It's alright, Julian. Even if Zachary is gone, I'll watch over you. I'll still remember you. Even if father is gone and it happens to Angelica Nee-san as well one day. I'll be fine as long as Emilia Nee-san is here. Please keep watching over me from now on as well! I did it. I did it! I did it, Sister! I can do it too. That's right! Even someone incompetent will improve as long as you keep working on it! Move forward, one step at a time, and keep going! Emillia Nee-san! Emillia Nee-san? Kill me... Damn it. Where are Miyu and Kuro? Let me hear your story. The Ainsworths'... Darius' wish is world salvation. But I think your wish is different. That's what I came hear. The reason why you're fighting so hard for. You little brat... You don't need to know about that... I see, you don't want to talk about it After all, it should be the most important thing in the world for you. Even if there was some way to save both the world and Miyu... That's all you'll be able to save. You want to to save Erika-chan. This is too funny. This isn't funny. Darius?! Such a masterpiece of a joke, what childish comprehension, I can't stop laughing! This isn't funny! That's just a hopelessly unfunny joke, Illyasviel! For Erika's sake? To protect Erika, you say? Your delusions are so childish that it makes me want to throw up! What are you talking about? More than anything! I treasure Erika more than anything in the world! Did she look like that kind of girl to you? Did you see her as a pitiful child unable to escape destiny? That's why my wish is just one thing... My wish is just one thing... To protect Erika. To kill Erika. That is the only reason I fight! Miyu, wake up. Miyu-sama. Kuro? Sapphire? What in the world happened? Well, I'm the one who wants to ask about that. What is is this place? You have lost. Erika. I welcome you both... This is the world that is nowhere. Let's take it easy in here until they finish their talk outside, okay? Kuro! Ouch... I'm shocked, Onee-chan. What is happening to you? You're not like the Erika I know. What do you even know about me? Onee-chan, you were the one who said "I'm not your friend", right? That was... It's fine. Everything was a lie anyway. Those times, even right now, we've always lied to each other. Which is why I want to disappear. You and I. The sides we stand on conflict too much to be able to say we're friends. But, even so... Please tell me the reason of your suffering. Yeah, okay, I'll tell you all about it! I am... Your true goal is to kill her? Erika-chan is your little sister, and yet... Who said that Erika is my little sister? There was no blood relationship from the beginning. And the name Erika is just an alias. Her true name is... Yes... Emilia! Emilia? No, wait... Wasn't that just the name before? Wait, I remember. I remember everything. What are you talking about? What... Oh, that's right, as if I'd ever forget. The original woman... The one who was always with me, a gift from the gods! Her original name is... My true name is Pandora. 6,000 years ago, the Pithos was made by the gods to avert the destruction of mankind. And the gods created a mud doll as the key to open it. And now, having left that role unfulfilled, I'm a debt from the Age of Gods that ended up living to the present day. As a guarantee, my "Death" was made by the gods to be sealed within the Pithos. And the Pithos will never open until destruction comes. This is who I am. The story of Pandora that will never end until I die. Now, Onee-chan... Will you be my friend? Then does that mean... that Erika-chan has lived from 6,000 years ago until now? That's... - Imp... - Impossible? Yeah. I wonder how many tens of thousands of times has she been bombareded with those words. Be careful, Illya-san! The Pithos can be opened when humanity is on the brink of destruction. It's now or never. However, having lived 6,000 year, Pandora's function as a key has been destroyed. That's why... I will open it myself, using the Holy Grail. Which will you choose, Illyasviel? Will you open it? Or... Will you not? It's been about 2,000 years since I've been given that look. This is why I hate humans. So basically, your grand plan is collective suicide. Sounds like a pain. What? Don't let her sway you, Miyu. No matter what her circumstances are... It doesn't matter. No matter what your reason is... None of it is a good enough reason to sacrifice Miyu. Kuro... Don't ever forget, Miyu. Even if the entire world were to turn on us... Even if you were to give up on yourself, we're not giving up. On the future Onii-chan wished for you. Erika. No, Pandora... You're still lying. Lying, you say...? Saving humanity... Letting Pandora die... Opening the box... These aren't lies in themselves. But... They aren't the truth either! What's your damn point? You must've suffered, for a long time. I can't even imagine how much pain you've been in. That is why your wish of wanting to just die after having lived 6,000 years is a facade. A facade? A facade, you say? Don't screw with me! What would you know? I'll open the Pithos and kill Pandora! That's her wish! And the only way to prevent humanity's destruction! This is the only path! If your wish to kill Pandora truly came from the bottom of your heart, then... Why are you making that face? My face...? The anguish of an endless life... I get why you would wish for death. But, even so, that's surely wrong. What's so wrong about it? Why are you saying such a thing? Because I know someone who still wished for the future despite the despair of losing everything. He lost, was hurt, and was beaten down. But that person still smiled, even though his heart and body were a wreck. He was still able to wish for the happiness of someone else. People posses that kind of strength. You'll be wishing upon me, the Holy Grail, right? Then, stop lying... I won't grant a fake wish like yours! Shut up! Shut up! "Truth", "lies"... I couldn't care less for those things! I will open the Pithos! You all are really always lying, aren't you? If you say it doesn't matter, then where's your anger coming from? You wished, right? For your dreams. For your ideals. You can't forgive yourself for giving those up. I won't give up on anything anymore! And I won't lose to a liar like you! Nonsense! You borrowed the power of the cards. You borrowed the power of that stick. Even the reason you fight is borrowed. Don't intrude on my legend, you lowly extra. Your role ends here. It's as you say. All of my power is borrowed. The card's power and Ruby's power... And all the people I've met until now. It's thanks to everyone's power I've borrowed... That I'm here right right now! Ah, it's those eye... The eyes of a dreaming child... I despise them! Why? There's no reason for you to be putting your life on the line like this! And yet why are you going so far to... If there was... someone right in front of you, who only you can save... What would you do? What? Even if you ask "why" or "for what", I can't put my reason into words very well. Still, I'll reach out my hand. If there's someone suffering right in front of me. You... Kill her. That's enough, just kill her already, Julian. I don't know why, but those words were horribly unpleasant. Yeah, I agree... That's the first time we've seen eye to eye, Darius! Annoying. You're so annoying. I can't stand playing along with you anymore! What is that thing? Impossible! Those thorns are Julian's Magic Circuits expanded outwards! The source of his magical energy is from absorbing an endless amount of magical energy like a planet! Blackness. My world is entirely pitch black. I'll kill you, I'll kill Pandora, and then I'll dissappear! No matter what you say, you can't change the plot anymore. I'll crush you, Illyasviel! And yet, why? The Ainsworths really can't stop lying. In that case, I'll be the one to say it on behalf of all of you. Why? Why is she... "I'll kill" is "I don't want to kill"... "I want to die" means "I want to live"! So dazzling? Be gone! Be gone! Be gone and disappear forever, Illyasviel! Bellerophon! Bridle of Chivalry We're going to lose at this rate! Overwrite Install! Berserker! In that case... That's... Padnora's Box! A counterfeit of the world created by the gods of Olympus... That is the blade that will pierce you! Damn it! Stay away! Good grief. Despite this being such an important time, you still can't do it? Just like that time... So, that's what all the fuss was about. Father...? No. Darius sama? What are you doing? The tool she used this time is... Why...? Why did she...? I see. It looks like you tried making a promise for the future. Good grief, children can be so cruel. You shouldn't do that to Emilia, considering she can't grow or die. I... I was just... Nee-san! Kill me. Even though I want to die... Even though it hurts so much... I can't die. I beg of you. Kill me. A shell made of thorns. It's just like your heart. Uninstall! I'm going to destroy it! Because I know Beatrice's, Angelica's, Shirou-san's... and everyone's wishes. And for your wish too! My wish... At that time, how did I answer her? Please kill me. No. I will never let you meet your end with a look like that on your face! That's right. My wish was not to kill Nee-san. All I wanted... was for her to smile. It's just too awful. That after living for 6,000 years, begging for death is all you have left. You've been suffering all this time, right? It's been painful, right? So much that all you can think about now is wanting to die. But that's all the more reason... One day for sure, I'll find a way to let you die. So... So please don't cry, Nee-san. That's right. That's right. "I don't want die", "I want to keep living". "Ah, but it wasn't a bad life." is what I wished she'd say, while smiling. Yeah, I'm sure of it now. You're just like Shirou-san. Drivel from a child. You and Emiya are just children. Chasing ideals while being selfish and stubborn, just children. That's why... That's why I was defeated. She had the eyes I did back then. That of a child. Wait, what's happening? This... It can't be... This must be Illya. Pandora, we're heading to the outside. Although world and people too only add to my wounds? Even so, you have to face forward. After all, it's people who ought to heal their own wounds. This is... I was wondering where that mysterious space was, but it was inside the box? Kuro! Miyu! Illya! It's over, isn't it? Yeah, it's over. Pandora. You were too greedy. To try using two Grails... That's right, you said your goal was to open the box. But one Holy Grail would've been enough. Yet you desired for both Miyu and Illya. Why? Look around you. The contents of the Pithos is rotten mud, a whole planet's worth of ruined possibilites. If I open the Pithos, then Pandora can die. But... The mud will not stop until it covers the entire planet. That's why I needed one Grail to open the Pithos and another one to destroy it. Oh right, I can't let this be the last view she sees. Pandora's last... One without sorrow. One where she must be at peace. I just wanted to show her that I and the world will be okay. And the future! No use, huh... I'm always one step short from reaching it. I know that you'll always keep going, one step at a time. I was so happy that you've been working so hard over the last 10 years for my sake. You're the second person who's tried to open the Pithos in earnest. It might have felt like it was just a blink on an eye, but... I'm glad to have spent it with you. Good night, big brother. Good night, big sister. - What... - What? It's a shame, but this isn't the end of the story. Illya-san, the ending starts now. No, no, I got tired of waiting around. But this doesn't change anything. Nothing has changed at all. My concept replacement is now complete. Now then, let us finish this Holy Grail War. Kuro!
