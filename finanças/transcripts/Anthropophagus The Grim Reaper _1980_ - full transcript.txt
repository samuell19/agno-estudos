[IN GERMAN] This place is not very crowded. Right, but it's so warm and beautiful. Do you know how to swim? Not that much. - Want to go swimming, later? - Sure. The dog likes swimming, too. It would be fun swimming with him. The three of us together? It's not too windy here. Let's sit down. It's beautiful. Good dog. It's freezing cold! We just ate, you shouldn't be swimming! You're the one that ate a lot, I've just had a sandwich! It's fantastic! Help! Help! I don't feel well. It's the cable-car, dear. - What's wrong, Maggie? - Nothing, it's over now. It's the heir throwing a fit. He's started to kick with all this movement. Just think what he'll do when we'll get on the boat. No, any risks and the doctor wouldn't have allowed us to go. Anyway, we'll only use the boat to go from one island to another. No, don't count on that. Alan told me he's rented it for a month. He wants to use it as much as he can and tour the whole archipelago. It won't be possible with Maggie in this state. Then just leave the two of us on the first island and get us on the way back. - Come on dear, sit down. - Yes, I really should. Be careful. Damn it. - I'm really sorry. - It's nothing. - I'll pay for it. - Don't... - It's the least I can do. - My husband is always so clumsy. - I'm sorry. Really, it's nothing. Actually, I've heard you mentioning a boat. Any idea if there's a place for an extra person? What? You want to come with us? Guys, you reckon Alan would mind if we bring her along? No. I just need a lift to reach some friends on one of the islands. Alright. - We have a deal? - Sure. - I bet he hasn't arrived yet. - Same old. - He's always late. There he is. - Alan! - We're here! - Would you look at him. - He's so tanned! - Hi! - Alan! Hi... - Hey. - How is it going? - You look great, Alan. - Just look at your belly. - Hello, old friend! - Arnold! Alan, this is Julie. - Pleased. - Likewise. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure. - Come on, all aboard! - Let's go. - I ride shotgun. - Arnold, sit in the back with me. We need to stop at the hotel to get our luggage. - Let's go! - Hold on! This is the island I have to reach. It's about 100 miles off the coast. Well, I reckon we could include it in our tour. No ferry services connecting it. That's weird. Not weird at all. It's practically empty during off-season. It's inhabited by some self-sufficient families. The tourists visit it only in the summer, and I assure you it's a real paradise. - How do they get there? - They either got a boat or hitch a ride. Unfortunately, I had a complication and couldn't arrive in time. I was supposed to join my friends three days ago. - But we wouldn't have met you. - Right! Well, shall we go to this paradise or not? Let's put it to a vote. Raise your hand for "yes". Yes! Let's go, then. I can't wait to get on the boat. - How long will it take to get there? - Two days. - Is that so? - Is everyone aboard? - Yep, everyone, let's go. Everyone accounted for. Let's go. Give me the bag. This way. Come on! Don't worry darling, please. It's normal, I feel a little queasy myself. Here. - Wonderful, isn't it? - Yes, it's gorgeous. Excuse me. Thanks. - He's not wasting time, huh? - I guess not. Actually, I feel flattered. He's a nice boy. I like Carol too, and she really likes him. Well, don't feel too flattered, he tries his moves with every girl. - Why don't you like him? - I do like him, he's funny. The thing is, Carol is my sister. - Wanna hold the wheel? - Yeah, sure. Watch the compass and change the route if the needle moves away from this point. Easier said than done. - Well done. - Thanks. Here. This card is for the past, this one for the present, and this one for the future. Come on, Carol, forget about the past and the present, I know those perfectly. Tell me about the future. What do you want to know? If it's a boy or a girl and will live a happy life. I want to know everything about the baby. Place your right hand on the cards. Good, now choose three cards and turn them over. Done. Now use your right hand to turn another one over. Well? What? Carol? Are you going to say something or not? - Are you ok? What do the cards say? - To be honest, I don't know. Sometimes they aren't very clear, and they don't always reveal something. I can't interpret them. I don't see anything. I only see a big confusion, it's never happened before. I think we should try again later. Oh, come on. They look quite clear to me. The two knights are two men by your side. One of them is Arnold and the other one is the baby. So, I guess it's a boy. The sun is a positive sign. It means strength, security. It will protect the two knights for the rest of their lives. The night symbolizes peace and serenity. - And... - And it's time to eat. As long as someone knows where the can opener is. I'd better give him a hand if we don't want to skip dinner. We aren't done yet, let's resume this later. I'd better give them a hand as well. Thanks. You managed to reassure Maggie. Why did you stop? Because the cards didn't reply, and I believe in them. And if I don't read them clearly I just can't invent lies. Carol... If the cards didn't reply, why are you so worried? If you ask them about the future and you don't get a reply... Then it means there's no future for the person who asked the question. Girls, aren't you coming to eat? - Good morning! - Hi. Good morning. - Hello. - Hi. Maggie's still sleeping. We shouldn't be too far from the island, right? If the wind keeps up like this we should reach it in a couple of hours. - Do you want one? - No, thanks. - Are your friends waiting for you? - Sure. But, to be honest, they aren't really friends. It's a French couple with a 15 year old daughter. I keep her company and they pay for my holiday, that's all. And what do you do in winter? Well, in winter I'm a language student at university. In my spare time, I also work for a private TV station. - What about you? - Medicine. Two exams to go and I've finished. And the cruises and the good life will finish as well. - Tell me, did you argue with Carol? - No, why? It's strange, she was already up when I woke up this morning. I asked her what was wrong and she replied we shouldn't have let you come with us. She also begged me not to go ashore on the island. I couldn't get anything else out of her. Don't worry, Carol's a bit moody. She's been that way since she was a child. And those damned cards are to blame. We've never been able to make Carol stop, it's stronger than her. That's the island! - Be careful here. - You were right to call it a paradise. - Why don't we stay for a while? - That's worth a thought. - Where's the village? - Just behind that ridge. Good. We'll go with you. - Let's go. - Thanks. Give me that. Come on, Maggie. Take it easy. Maggie, careful! My ankle... It must be dislocated. That's just what we needed now. I don't think I can join you, I'm sorry. - What a shame. - Put the foot in water to avoid swelling. - Do you want me to stay with you? - No, it doesn't matter, you go. Goodbye, Maggie. Thank you. Goodbye, Julie. Enjoy your stay. Let's go, Carol. - Do you need anything, Maggie? - No, thank you. Go. Careful. - It's strange, though. - What? - I don't see my friends' boat. - It's probably moored somewhere else. There must be another jetty. As far as I know, there weren't any others two years ago. I guess they built another one since then. I guess. I noticed there was a strong current as we approached the island. I had already heard about it from my French friends. Very erratic currents. Sometimes they push towards land, and other times out to sea. - I guess they're influenced by the tide. - Probably. I've risked my life last time. The current dragged me far and I couldn't get back. - This place feels like a ghost town. - Yeah. Well, Julie said it was a quiet little village. Hello, anyone around? - Not a single soul in sight. - They must be in church. - Looks like it. - The only church is by the old cemetery. - But it's deconsecrated and in ruins. - Let's take a look around. Come on, Carol. Let's go. Let's look in the general store. Here's the telegraph. Not in the best shape. Not in the best shape? I'd say it's been wrecked. Any telephones on the island? No. It's never been linked to the continent. It was their only means of communication. Look here, the last message was sent on the 7th of June. That's more than a month ago. Something isn't right, you know? Hey! A little jumpy, huh? - Did you solve the mystery? - No. - Where are the others? - Attempting to find someone. Daniel, let's go back. Look. A woman. Then there's someone here, Carol. Let's take a look. Excuse me? Can we come in? Anyone here? Why don't they answer? The window! Look! "Go away." There she is! She's trying to get away, let's go! - Ashab? - Yes? Could you please change the water? Do you mind? No problem, ma'am. Ashab? Ashab? It looks like he's been eaten alive. Nothing. They've vanished into thin air. - Let's return to the boat. - Maggie! Maggie is alone! - Maggie... - Arnold! - Maggie... - Arnold, stop! - Maggie! - What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? - Let me go, it's drifting away! - You won't make it! - Maggie is there! - Ashab is with her! He's a good sailor! Calm down! He must have gone downwind after sensing a storm coming. Yes, that must be it. The boat will return tomorrow morning. It's getting dark, there's nothing more we can do. We just need to remain calm. You're right, it's getting dark. We'd better find a place where we can spend the night. Right. Let's go to my French friends' house. I'm sure they'll let us stay. - That's their stuff? - Yes, but they've disappeared. It feels like a nightmare. What could have happened? I have no idea. Any theory just seems so absurd. They could have fled after someone frightened them. But nobody runs away without taking at least some of their personal effects. Unless they so were so scared that they fled in panic. Maybe an epidemic broke out. - Some kind of fast-acting virus. - No such virus exists. Besides, we would have found the corpses. Don't you think? That woman Daniel saw, she must know what happened. Maybe she'll turn up again. If she had that intention, we'd have seen her by now. No, I don't think she'll reappear again. Even if she attempted to frighten us with that macabre masquerade. She managed to. Even though it might be too late. Hey! Hello. This is such a romantic picture. Not to mind your business, but will you be eating in your room or the dining hall? Service included. - Does anyone want more? - No, thanks. We should make Arnold eat something. I made him guzzle a bottle of wine. Better if he sleeps until tomorrow. Poor Maggie. We should look for her. Maybe she wasn't on the boat. - It would be pointless. - What do you mean, pointless? - How can you say something like that? - Because I can feel it. Just like I felt that we should have never come to this island. But you didn't listen. I had this feeling straight away. Yet we still got off the boat. And now it's too late. There's an evil presence on this island. A presence that won't allow us to leave. Something inhuman, even diabolical. I can feel its vibrations in the air. And these vibrations belong to some horrendous power. It will destroy us. It will destroy us like it did with all the others. That's enough, Carol. We'll look for Maggie in the morning. - Alright? - Alright. We'd better get some sleep now. There are two bedrooms. I say we all sleep in the living room. Yes. We can use the sofa. I heard it as well. Let's check it out. Look, a piano. Here, kitty. - Julie! - I'm here! Come here! Help me! Let's get him upstairs! - Henriette! Henriette! - Easy... It's me, Julie. Don't you remember me? Calm down. It's over. Take it easy! Shut it, it's nothing serious. She didn't hit any vital organs, it's just a cut. Even if it's a deep cut. Boil some water, clean the wound and bandage it. - How is she? - In bad shape. Her mental state is a mess. Who knows how long she's been down there? She's the daughter of those French friends I told you about. You didn't tell me she was blind. It happened in a car accident, when she was five. - How's Daniel? - It's nothing serious. My only worry is that it might get infected. I'm going to get some antibiotics. I saw them in the general store. - Are you going now? - Yes, it'd be better. I'll take Arnold with me. Henriette... Can you hear me? What happened in the village? What happened to your mother and father? I don't know. - But they're scared. - Scared of what? I don't know! I call them, but they don't answer. Mum, dad, where are you? There's nobody left. Nobody! There's just him. I can hear when he's close. I can smell him. Yes, yes, I'm the only one who can hear him. I can feel when he's close. - I can smell his scent. - Who is he? What scent? The scent of blood. He smells of blood. Of blood! Please calm down, it's all over now. You don't have to be afraid. We're here. We're here. - It's not too tight, is it? - No, it's fine, thanks. - Try to get some rest, now. - Alright. Where's Julie? Upstairs. With the girl. They should be there. - Found them. - Let's go. Do you want one? Thank you. - Does it hurt? - No, it's just a scratch. - But you'd better rest. - I'd rather keep you company. When will this storm end? It's not raining anymore but the air is still filled with static. - You're scared, aren't you? - Yes. But you manage not to show it. You're gorgeous. You're an all-around amazing girl. Julie, I... I don't know if you've realized that... - No, it doesn't feel right, Daniel. - It's because of Carol, isn't it? You're wrong. There's just an old friendship between Carol and me. - I don't care about how things are. - Okay, you're not interested. But I'm still going to tell you. Maybe she loves me, but she'll never give me what I'm looking for in a woman. Why? What are you looking for in a woman? Well, I don't know how to call it. But I know for sure that I would find it with you. Carol. Damn you! It's all your fault! Everything that's happening, It's all your fault! Damn you! I'll make you pay for this! Carol, I... Carol! - Where's that stupid girl going? - Stay here, I'll go after her. Carol! Carol! Carol! Carol! Carol! Carol? What are you doing? Open! Open this gate! Carol! Carol, where are you going? Alan! Julie, what happened? - Carol ran away again. - Where is she now? I don't know, she locked me in the cemetery and ran away. - Maybe she went back in the house. - Let's go! - Maybe. Julie? Carol? What happened? What's wrong? He's here! He's close. I can feel his scent. Remain calm, I'm here. I'm locking the door. You remain calm. No! Daniel? Daniel, where are you? No! Henriette! My little girl... Henriette... - Alan! - Huh? What's wrong? Let's keep walking. There's no use, they're dead. They're all dead, Alan. Carol was right, this place is cursed. That monster will kill us all. He'll kill me too, Alan, I can feel it. Stop this nonsense. The curse, the monster... It's a bunch of crap. It's true, we can't deny a bite from a man killed Daniel... But maybe it's the work of some deranged individual. And we can kill him before he kills us. And I also say we can't abandon Maggie and Carol. Dead or alive, we have to find them. Let's go. Come on. Carol! I wonder who owns this place. It's probably the Wortmann's. I've never seen it, but it must be theirs. Klaus Wortmann was in the papers a few months ago. His yacht sank in the archipelago. He disappeared along with his wife and son. And there's no one left in the family? Careful, Henriette. A sister, I think. The papers said the tragedy made her crazy. They were very close. Careful here... Careful. The Wortmann family owned the island. The first Wortmanns settled here almost a century ago. Let's take a look upstairs. Let's go. My God. Quick, cut the rope. God... Who's this woman? Maybe Ruth, Klaus Wortmann's sister. Alan! Julie! Come upstairs! Let's go, Henriette. Be careful. Carol, say something! What happened? Oh, Alan... Alan! Daniel... Daniel is dead, isn't he? Yes. - But how do you know? - The woman told me. - Where is she? - She killed herself. How did she know? I don't know, but she was good to me. Despite her strange behaviour. Last night, before I fell asleep, she came to me... Desperately begging for forgiveness. Who knows why? She was upset. Alan, look! The boat! I knew it. The currents brought it closer to the island. We must try to reach it before it drifts away again. Let's go, Arnold. You wait here. - How do you feel? - A bit drowsy. I think they gave me a tranquilizer. - Let's catch up with the others. - Give me just a moment to gather myself. I... I want to apologize, Julie. I've been so mean to you. Forget about it, Carol. It's all over now. Why? Why did she kill herself? I don't know. There's something terrible happening. - That's the woman, right? - Yes. And this is her brother who died at sea along with his wife and son. They were a good family. - What is it? - A notebook. A notebook... With some handwritten notes. It looks like a diary. "May 12, today they found the bodies of the two German kids." "Their horrific slaughter has terrorized the village." I can't understand nothing more. It's all burnt. There's something legible here. "Many have died, the village talks of a monster." "The tourists are leaving the island, but he keeps on killing." "The police arrived but they won't be able to do anything to him." "I've also hidden the bodies." "They don't have proofs without the corpses." "I've managed to hide the entrance to the room." Julie? What does that mean? We've got to find a way to reach the boat. - Let's split up. - Yeah. You go that way. Maggie. I'll go. You stay with Henriette. Yes. - Maggie! - Arnold... Arnold... Here. I'll take you away. Go away! Leave us alone! We have never done anything to you. Go away! Go away! Go away! My wife is pregnant, can't you see it? She's expecting a baby! My child! Our child! Go away! Go away! No, you can't do it! He's our son! He's dead, he's just food now, food that we need to survive. You won't touch him! He's our son! Eat! Eat me, damn you! Marta! Marta! Marta! Marta... No! No! Sit down, dear. Here. Don't worry. Julie! Julie! - Julie, where are you? - Over here. - Julie... - It's horrible, Carol. That man is a deranged maniac. Carol... Henriette! Henriette! Let's go! We've gotta get out of here! Hurry! Hurry! Careful! Come on! Here! Come on! - Julie, where are we? - Quiet, don't speak. Henriette! Stay down, Henriette! No! No! Henriette... Henriette... Damn you...
