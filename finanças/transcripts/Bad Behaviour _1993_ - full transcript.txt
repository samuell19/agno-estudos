[music playing] He's here now. It's for you. Hiya. Hiya. When did you get back? Last night. Was it brilliant? Oh, fabulous. You should have been there. So what did you do? Oh, what didn't I do? What a city-- stunning. Listen, I've got to go, because I've got a class. Have you seen [inaudible] yet? Fat chance, no. How about Thursday? No, Thursday is no good. Gerry has got a planning meaning in the evening. He can cancel a meeting. He can't really. What if you were ill? He'll have to cancel then. Well, I'm not ill, am I? When was the last time you went out? Last time I saw you, I think. Give us a ring tomorrow. Yeah, I'll do my best. I'll do my best. LINDA: Ciao. - Bye. You look terrific. Hi, Roy. That's nice parking, Howard. It's more like a garden shed than it is a back extension. If we don't knock it down, it will fall down. Yeah, don't worry about that, Roy. Just come up here. I want to show you something. How much did you pay for it? A lot of money-- bathroom-- kitchen-- wall in here. Pull this wall back-- that's the entrance-- a little doorway here. How wide is it? Hey, you're on. [beeping] 1,046. What's that in meters? [beeping] 321. You flash bastard. I'm going to need an estimate for the conversion, but before you do that, can you give me a price of rebuilding that back extension? ROY: I'll get Ray to come and have a look, but it'll work out cheaper if he prices up the whole lot. Yeah, no, you get him to, uh, look at the extension first. It's your money, Howard. We'll need some plans. - Mom? - Uh-huh? I'm bored. MAN: Look out! [crash] [yelling] JOEY: What's that? I don't know. Shit. Bring the thing upstairs. MICHAEL: Oh, shut up, Jake. Boys, what are you doing? Nothing. Michael-- [buzzer] Oh, hi. Hiya, Howard. I've, uh, come to pick Jake up, but I'm a bit early. That's OK. Come in. He's upstairs. I'll go and get him. Uh, is it OK if I use your bathroom. Sure. Through there. HOWARD: All right, cheers. Jake. Jake. Jake. - Yeah? ELLIE: Jake. your dad is here. I'll come in a minute then. And Mike, I want all that stuff back in your room. I'm doing it now. ELLIE: Yeah, well do it quicker. JOEY: Ow! Oh, hi. Hi. What are you looking at? Well, I noticed there was a couple of cracks in your bathroom. So I was just checking to see if I could see anything on the outside. Well, it at least has a a shift-- a bottom clay, you see? Yeah. So are you in the building trade? Yeah, indirectly. Lovely place. Mhm. How long have you been here? About 15 years. Do you want a cup of tea? Yeah, yeah, that would be good. Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? What? How do you use this? Potato peeler? Yeah. You peel. Show me. HOWARD: Oh, yeah, You do it the wrong way too. Sorry? May I? You see, this implement is designed to be, uh, used away from the body. You were doing it towards the body. Probably because I'm Irish. Yeah. [phone ringing] Hello? Howard Spink. Say it again. Hold on. What? Yeah, where. Yeah, all right, I'll, uh, yeah, I'll come over in about, uh, 15 minutes. [beep] Look, I'm sorry about this. I'm afraid I've got to shoot off. Something's come up. Ah, yeah, those are the cracks I was, uh, talking about. Yeah, well, there's movement, you see? Yeah I could be subsidence. So you should get it looked at. Yeah, well, I've been meaning to do something about that room for ages. Uh, actually, I know some people who could handle that for you. ELLIE: Really? Yeah, a local company-- a number of those. Do you know them? - No. Jake. They any good? Yeah, yeah, very good. I'll get them to give you a call. - Well, I can give him a ring. - No, no. It's all right. I'll get them to call you. Jake! JAKE: [inaudible]? No. [dialing] Hello, Roy, Howard Spink. Yeah, listen, I've got a little job I'd like you to know about. [buzzer] How are you, Jess? Hey, Rosie. Are you busy? Um, no, no. Come in. Come in. Come in. [music playing] So how is things? Fine. You're not fine, are you? I know, Ellie, I don't know what to do. I mean, you know, I'm just trying to keep my head above water and hang onto my self-respect. What's happened? I went to the solicitor. And? He's not going to get access, not while that woman's there. That's final. Jess, don't you think that's a bit unrealistic. I mean, they live together. Ellie, why am I out there working, you know, and she's living in my house? JESS: I mean, they won't be long. ELLIE: How do you know that? JESS: Because I know him. ELLIE: I mean, maybe this time is going to different. What are you saying? She's miss perfect? ELLIE: Hiya. Hiya. Some grapes there. Oh, thanks. OK? Yeah. ELLIE: Do you want a cup of tea? GERRY: No. I'm fine. Is your woman away? Yeah. What's eating you? Your dinner is going to be late. [sigh] There was half the population of North London around here for tea this afternoon. Howard came around, Jake's dad. He was having a pee. Has he got no toilet of his own? And when he came out, he told me that the house was falling down around our ears. There were cracks in the ceiling. The lying bastard. This house is in mint condition. Bloody isn't. It's on the run, shifting down the hill. There was a bit of movement, but it's settled. There was a wee bit of a slope. It starts about just summer, but ahhhhh ohhh! Help! Throw me down a crampon. I'm trying to get back up there. ELLIE: Gerry. Now, we have to do something. You recommended some builders. I'm going to get them around to do an estimate. Big Gonch. What does he know about anything? So what's for dinner? Nothing? When was there ever nothing for dinner. It's all right. We can get a takeaway. Is there any chance of a drink around here, is there? GERRY: Yeah, sure. What do you want? What's for dinner, mom? I'm starving. GERRY: Nothing. [music playing] I think I might ask Rosie to do some babysitting. Why? Are you thinking of going somewhere? Are you thinking of taking me? No, I don't mean the evenings. I mean the afternoons. Then I could have a bit of time to myself. Joey is old enough to come home from school himself, you know? What? GERRY: Mmm. Put a wee key around his neck. I did it. ELLIE: At 7:00? Yeah. ELLIE: Go away I did. Oh, I can just see Betty letting you run around the streets of Belfast. HOWARD: Well, she did it. With your poor wee chest. I don't think that's very fair bringing up my chest like that. [inaudible]. You were right. Joe-- Joey. What? ELLIE: Go home and put on your pajamas, please. But it isn't time yet. Just put your pajamas on. [gunshot sound] Joey, don't put that in your mouth. It's bad for you. Why? What does it do? Ah, well, I use it when I-- I want to become a superhero, OK? Right? Here's me at work. Does that look like me? JOEY: A bit. Gee, thanks. OK, I'm working. There's my plans, yeah? Nobody's very enthusiastic about it. So it makes me mad. Oh. So I have a go on my bronchodilator. Gasp. Weeze. Ah, the hands are shaking. See them shaking there? JOEY: Yeah. Ah, the heart just pounding, and I turn it into-- Paddy Plan-It. Get it? What's that say? "Trapped in a world of his making." GERRY: "Not of his making." JOEY: "Not of his making." GERRY: Yeah. Very good. What does this really do? Well, if-- you know what it does? If I have a wheeze, yeah? I take a wee puff on that. It makes me feel better. Why do you get a wheeze? Well, I don't know. It's just something I've always had. Will I get one? Nah, you'll be all right. You would have had it by know if you were going to get it. GERRY: [inaudible]. Well-- well, uh, I don't want to be rude about him, but um, like he-- he's a bit long-winded, he? It Rita, I tell you what here, I'll uh-- I'll call up and see on my way home this evening, OK? Yeah? OK. And between now and then just you relax. Put your feet up. No. OK. No problem. Right. Thanks a lot. Bye. Bye. Sorry to interrupt. Um, I've got to be downstairs. I should have been on the inquiry desk about a half an hour ago. It doesn't matter. If they-- if they need you, they'll phone up for you. Oh, right, well, this is a draft for the planning committee. Could you just check it over? I just want to make sure I've got everything in there. Yep. And, um, I have a problem, because we have no photographs at the moment. And I've just been on to Grendel. And she says environment and design can't do anymore. So I don't when I'm going to do it, but at some point today, I'm going to have to go down there and take some photographs, because I can't do it tomorrow. Well, uh, I have to-- I have to go up there this evening to see Rita so I can do some snaps going up there. Yeah? Yeah, no problem. Brilliant. Um, all right. OK. I'll be down at the desk. All right. Ron, have you got the camera? Back in the drawer, I think. [music playing] Hello. - Hello, can I help you? - It's Joe. How are you today? I'm fine, thank you. OK. I called up earlier to ask about planning applications on a house in Mills Road, Cavendish Town. Uh, could I have a look at that? Yeah, have you got the application number? Yeah, it's, uh, 9300354. ASSISTANT: Oh, just a second please. [music playing] GERRY: Would you mind just stepping out? Oh. Sorry. GERRY: Unless you'd like me to take your photograph, would you? - Oh, no, no. Would you? Go in. No. No. [camera shutter] I mean, it's not a big piece of land, is it? She's uh, she's calmed down now. Yeah, she's feeling much better. I do agree with her though that, uh, I think there should be an independent voice heard at that meeting, and, uh, well, I'd be more than happy to speak on their behalf. Do you think that would be a good idea, Gerry? Not particularly. PRIEST: But there is a group of people who are saying that the local community are against this site. And, well, that's not true. And I think there should be somebody there speaking for them. There will be somebody speaking for them. The planning department is going to recommend this as a permanent site for travelers. I appreciate that. But, um, well, I think-- I think if my voice was the one heard speaking on their behalf, then, uh, well, I think it would support your case. I don't think it's necessary. But suit yourself. If you really want to speak, you should contact John Clark. He's the chairman of that particular planning committee. But I don't think you'd get very far with him. Bye, bye. Say hello to Mrs. McAllister. GERRY: I usually do. ROY: We'll have to fit that cupboard into the old one, see? ELLIE: Yeah, yeah. It's a shame [inaudible], isn't it? That's why the chair is there. And it should be round there. But it won't fit. Oh, hiya. Hiya. This is my husband, Gerry. Roy Nunn. How do you do? [inaudible]. Ah, listen, I'll-- I'll leave you to it, OK? All right. I'm just getting an estimate. Oh, yes. Now, it has to be done. Oh, yes. He's very nice. Oh, well, that's the most important thing, isn't it? ELLIE: Well, you know what I mean. How can you be fair? I thought we'd, um, replace the sink in the loo when we're out. What with? With more modern appliances. Oh, yes. Well, it's horrible there. It's all right for a flying visit, I suppose-- a bit rough for "War and Peace." You're desperate. ROY: All right, Mrs. McAllister, I'll figure my sums, and I'll, um, drop that round to you in a couple of days. ELLIE: Great. Cheerio then. Thanks a lot. Bye. Looks all right to me. Out of the way. That's a nice wee toilet-- if you cleaned it a bit more often. - What did you say? - It was a joke. It was a joke. It Better have been. [inaudible]. A joke of very bad taste, let me tell you. [cough]. Oh, mom. Oh, the smoke. We don't need the candle. It's not for the light. This place is a mess. Have you eaten? No. Why not? Because I'm not hungry. Go eat, mom. Should i make you something? - I don't want anything. Where have you been? At homework club. Homework club finished at 7 o'clock. Where have you been? I just told to. Rosie, the homework club finished two hours ago. Now where have you been since then? To get a kebab. Who with? Karly. Are you telling me the truth? Yeah. - You're not, are you? - Yeah. No you're not, Rosie. I can see it in your eyes. It doesn't take two hours to eat a kebab. Now where have you been? I've told you. You're lying to me, Rosie. [music playing] NARRATOR: Paddy Plan-It and his sidekick son once again battle against the evil, gentrifying forces within Nellie. What's that? Mind your own business. I'll say it when the time comes. I know what it is? Oh, do you, smarty? [inaudible] ELLIE: Where's mine? Still in the bottle. You a lush or something? Ha, that's the pot calling the kettle black if ever I heard it. [music playing] Do you think we'll live here for the rest of your lives? How would I know? Do you though? How would I know? I don't think I could bear it. Good night. Do you never think about moving? GERRY: Where do you want to go? Milton Keynes? You know where I want to go. Do you ever think about it? GERRY: Of course I think about it. What do you think about it? GERRY: I like the idea of it, but it's more complicated than it sounds. Why? GERRY: Well, I wouldn't get a job in Dublin. They put up buildings in Dublin. Yeah, with a planning permission. Why do you want to go home? Because I can't bear the idea of being here for another 40 years. You'd be lucky to get another 40 years. Oh, thanks. Are you all right? I don't know what's the matter with me. I don't seem to be doing anything that I want. You know, I'm half doing the bookshop. I'm half doing home. Well, what do you want to do? I don't know what I want to do. Well, there's a start. Well, what would you think if I started doing full days at the bookshop? OK, for me, fine, no problem. And your flextime could cope with picking up Joey, and doing all the shopping, and all that? You know it wouldn't. Yeah, I know it wouldn't. This is hopeless. Do you want to go downstairs for a cup of tea? No, I don't want to go down and get a cup of tea. What brought all of this on, anyway? You know when you get an asthma attack? GERRY: Yeah. Yeah, well, that's how I'm feeling. I feel I can't breathe and panicking all the time. Do you want to go on the puffer? It can't be the menopause. I'm too young. Mind you, I've heard you can get the menopause in your 30s. Oh, well, that will be it then. I'm going to sleep. GERRY: So well for you. I'm wide awake now. [clock ticking] [alarm] What's this one named Kaftputtson? Uh, I don't know about that one. Just ring the bell. Not another soap dodger I hope, Howard. What's this 82-A Wilmot Road? Oh, yeah, what's the name? Kennedy. Oh, yeah, Mrs. Kennedy. She's a single parent, leaking window frames, I think. ROY: Nice, is she? I don't know. I haven't met her. I'll do that one. And Mrs. Greggson. It's got here "pain." Oh, yeah, old Mrs. Greggson-- that's because she's a pain. You just have to, uh, give everything a close inspection, but make sure you don't find anything. Ray will do that one. Old ladies love him. Has he, um, done that estimate yet? No, but he was around here this morning. HOWARD: What do you think that's going to come out as? I don't know. 30,000, 32,000? Yeah, it'd be really good for me. And I could-- be maybe about 45,000? Well, I'll have to see the estimate. These things can be adjusted. By the way, Howard. Ray's been on my back about monies due. And he says you're in [inaudible]. Shit, well, you can handle Ray, can't you? He's my partner. I've got to listen to what he has to say sometimes. Well, what's 1,200 pound between friends? Look, you can have that money tomorrow, if you're not desperate. I don't want to put any pressure on you. I know times are hard and all that-- but if you can. The sooner we get the estimate process, the sooner everybody gets in on it. [inaudible]. OK. Yes, there's, um, quite an interest in the attendance of, uh, of interested parties. I'd like to shift the order of business about a bit if I may and take item number 11b, which you'll find in your papers. And it's to do with the, uh-- the Travelers camp site, which is at the junction of Randall Street and Bassett Road. Thank you, Jeff. This is a vacant site on the corner of Randall Street and Bassett Road. Um, there's little recent history. Uh, it was cleared for many years but has been occupied for the last three years by a family of Travelers, who have become part of the local community and whose children attend local schools. At the moment-- at the moment, there are nine vans on the site. This would be reduced to four pitches in compliance with DOE standards of 6 meters between vehicles if the site was to become permanent. "Martha ran, and shut the door, and turned the key. But before she did, they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang. And then everything was quiet. For even the wind ceased weathering for a few moments." Yeah, I think we could, um, we could put this vote now. So, uh, could I first of all see all those who were in favor of the planning department's recommendation for a 10-year tenure-- and those against it. Cheers. Victory is ours. [chink glasses] It was a pretty grubby little victory then, isn't it? Why? The subtext thing is that there is really a conflict there between the housing association and the council. Oh, so you're saying it wasn't my brilliant speech and persuasive arguments that-- Oh, no, no, there is no doubt that was the centerpiece of the entire evening, you know, the admirable delivery of your deposition-- Good. The dress, and the lipstick, and, yeah, I mean, that will live on in the annals of-- Of planning history. Planning-- planning history-- wonderful. I don't understand about the housing association and the councillors then. Well is that the council don't like the housing association, because they want to build sordid, little functional buildings for the homeless. Whereas, you know, the council wants to have a nice, little gentrified conservation area for themselves. Oh, you cynical old git. Nothing cynical. That's outrageous. That's not cynical at all. It's absolutely realistic. It is. The fact is at this stage, local government as an instrument for social change is completely fu-ucked. Yeah, all right. But the work that we've done in the last couple of weeks and tonight has had a direct impact on-- on people's lives. Yeah, I know you're right. You're right. I take it all back. You're right. No, no. I couldn't agree with you more. [inaudible] potato? Hey, yeah, do you like potatoes? - Yeah. - Patatas bravas. WINIFRED: Who is he you are looking for? ELLIE: I can't get away from something-- the first major love affair It was a disaster. I felt claustrophobic in Dublin after that. And? I have never told you this, but when I left university, I had this notion that I might earn my living by writing-- a very naive, romantic notion. So what happened? Gerry happened really. I was hardly off the boat. I was fully convinced that by the time I was 30, I'd been mortgaged off with a husband and two kids. So what did you do right that I did wrong? Fell in love with a bloke who fell off his pushbike. What? What do you mean? - He was killed. He wasn't. What happened? Sorry I laughed. Well, he was at these traffic lights, and the lorry behind him didn't see him, and the green light went on go and mowed him down. God, you must've been devastated. Mmm. It took a minute or two to get over it. So here I am-- the embodiment of your dream. Shit. I don't want to go to bed tonight. They are going to fucking stay open I am going to get really fucking smashed out of my brain. And I'm not going to bother going to work in the morning. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not. Who wants to go to work? Well, maybe you should think about, um, going back. Yeah, but I get the bill though. So you're going to get good and drunk? Yeah, well, I'll get the bill, and I'll get a drink. Can we-- can I have the bill? Did, um, Ronnie tell you about the salsa night? Well, I heard some rumor about it, yeah. Are you going to go? We have to, don't we? I think you do, yeah. You going? Yeah, of course I am. It's great. We're drinking. We're dancing. Yeah, well, I'm into drinking, but, uh, you know, Belfast men don't dance. Oh, no. No. That's a known fact. "California businessman, 43, handsome, tall, fit, Aquarius, DWM-- very successful." Done It with Mother? Dreads Women Menstruating? More likely, yeah. Just here, mate. OK, thanks, listen, I'll give you some money for that. OK? - No, no. That's too much. - No, no. That's OK. That'll do. You're going to need that much. OK? - OK, thanks. - Thanks a lot. - OK. - See you. - Bye. Bye, bye. Bye. Bye. Hiya. Hiya. Having a drink? Certainly are. Right. Three to go. ELLIE: Can you give me a call? WINIFRED: Yeah, sure. [inaudible] ELLIE: [inaudible] Your woman away? Yeah. How was the meeting? Yeah, it was good. What happened? Eh, got it through. She passed. Why aren't you more excited? That's terrific. Just another day in the life of a planner. Did you eat? Well, I had a couple of clingfilm sandwiches. You're breaking my heart. Yeah, it was pretty sad all right. We had your bolognese sauce. It was delicious. Well, you're the one that taught me how to make it. Well, you managed to get rid of Winifred in just under five minutes. That's amazing. Why didn't you come up and join us? GERRY: I just did. Yeah, when you hear the door bang. I went downstairs to get myself a drink, and I came straight back up. And you arrived like spectre at the bloody feast, and you cast a pall over the entire proceedings. Now, don't tell me that wasn't deliberate, because it was. Don't be dopey. Have you any idea of the effect you have on people? Do you have this effect on people at work? Oh, no, of course, they all love you to distraction at work, don't they? Yeah, uh, they all have folders of me above their desks. They think I'm fab. Did you go drinking with them? Some drink was taken. Look, what are you picking on me for, Nellie? You know perfectly well I'm picking on you. You're making a lot of fuss about nothing. Oh, listen, I'm going to bed. I've had enough of this. Nay. [music playing] Listen, would you just admit that you did it on purpose? Just admit it. Fuck off, Nellie. God, it's like coming up against a brick wall. Either you deny it or you make a joke about it. Give him a hair piece, will you, Nellie? Why do you call me Nellie? I've always called you Nellie. Yeah, but why do you call me Nellie? Because I love you. Yeah, I suppose you do. [video game sounds] [buzzer] - Hello, mate. - Hi. Can you get your mom? Yeah, mom. It's not today, is it? Yeah, today is the day. Right. We'll get this stuff through, eh? Sure. Yeah, I'd completely forgotten you're coming today. I'm sorry. Um, we're running a bit late. Come on through. The bathroom. OK. Excuse me. Yeah. Where is the bathroom? How do you mean where is the bathroom? The one we're working on. Well, it-- it's there. Thanks. Gerry. Huh? The builders are here. Oh, what? ELLIE: They are here today. GERRY: Oh, no. It's 8 o'clock, Gerry. Will you get up? It is not 8 o'clock-- 10 fucking minutes to 8:00. You're loud like a cheap watch. ELLIE: Will you get out of the bed? Ah, clo-- will you-- close the curtains, will you? Is this where the cupboard goes? No, it's going in the garden. I'll go and get those shelves. I won't be long. RAY: Yeah, you do that. ROY: Mrs. McAllister. ELLIE: Yes. ROY: I'm off. ELLIE: What? You've just arrived. I'm off to get some gear. I've left Ray on the job. Ray who? REPORTER (ON TV): Two councils are joining forces to take on the council department. You won't me to get rid of these towels, right? But-- you've just gone. Clever bugger, ain't I? That's Roy. I'm Ray. Twins? Well, holy divine god-- yes, all those tiles have to go. Can I have money for school? What? My 2 pounds. I haven't got. Go and ask your father for 2 quid.

Where's my English book? Red book. [crash] GERRY: Jesus Christ! What the fuck is going on down there? In the name of Jes-- oh, [inaudible]. Will you please stop that-- stop that hammering. I'm asking you please, look, give me 10 minutes-- 10 minutes. Just stop it for 10 minutes. And then you can start. Oh, Jesus Christ-- [video game sounds] Oh, god. Joey, should you not be getting ready for school? No. GERRY: Why not? It's not time yet. [inaudible] Christ. I hope I didn't drink all that whiskey. Did you drink all that wine too? Oh, no, son. I'm not a complete pig. No, your mother drank the wine. I think she's a bit of a lush. Do you know what would be [inaudible] Joey? What? Go and get a wee drink of water, will you? REPORTER (ON TV): Or is as the Commission for Racial Equality says, this whole thing is distasteful. I'm really sorry about all that shouting. He's feeling a big frail this morning. It's all right, don't worry about it. Thanks Um, where's your stopcock. Oh, god, I don't know where my stopcock is. It's all right. I'll find it. Thanks a million.

No, have you seen my puffer anywhere? No. Joey, would you please go upstairs, clean your teeth-- brush your hair. Go on. - I don't have to. - Go on. - Don't shout at him. Did you drink that amount of Irish last night? Yeah, I think I must have. Did you look upstairs? I can't find it. I found it. GERRY: What? Your puffer. Oh, oh, thanks very much. Where was it? It was in your pocket where it always is. Oh, geez, I think I'm going to be sick. Oh. Out of my way, mate. I think I'm going to be sick. - You're off. I'm off. Bye, darling. I'll see you later. GERRY: [vomiting] HOWARD: Hi, Michael. MICHAEL: Hello. Hi, Howard. What are you doing here? Hi, Ellie. is Roy here? I'm looking for him. I don't know which one is here. You didn't tell me there was a double version, did you? Oh, I'm sorry. And I can't tell which one is which. Well, Ray is the slow one. Ray is the slow-- Ray or Roy, whoever you are, Howard is here. Ah, that's Ray. Hi, Ray, where's Roy? Ray, where's Roy? I don't know. He's gone out to get some gear. Is he going to be long? I don't know. What are you doing here? I came to see Roy. [hammering] Oh. [inaudible] would you stop it? [hammering] Holy, Jesus, what is going on here? Please, stop that banging till I get out of the house. Morning Gerry. Once I have gone, you can knock the whole bloody place down as far as I'm concerned. Well, you said 10 minutes. ELLIE: Will you please stop roaring at them, please? Sorry. I'm sorry. I've got a headache. Do you want a cup of tea? Yes, please. Listen, I know I'm still 3/4 pissed. But am I seeing double. I told you, there are two of them. They are interchangeable. Ah, nice homely smell. Do you want a cup of tea, Howard? Yeah, yeah, that would be great. How do you take it? ah, Just a little milk, no sugar. Uh, everything OK up there [inaudible]. Yeah, as long as no more clones with hammers show up, I'll be all right, thanks. Little milk, no sugar. Listen, I'm going to try and raise Roy on the mobile. Oh, that's a good idea, Howard. Listen, um, I'm very, very sorry about last night. You're a killer, you are. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Roy Nunn? Oh, hi, Roy, it's Howard Spink. Listen, what time are you coming back to McAllister's? I'm here. Looks like I got a hold of him. You're Roy. That's right. Have I made you a cup of tea? I don't think so, no. Do you want a cup of tea? I'd love a cup of tea. - Can I have a word, Roy? - Yeah. Two sugars. - Two sugars. - Yeah, Ellie. - What? What is the creeping Jesus doing here? Ask him. Howard, what are you doing here? Uh, I'm just leaving. How many cups of tea did I pour? REPORTER (ON TV): He sends off.

How are you this morning? OK. A big knackered. I'm in rag order. I wasn't going to come into work at all. Only it's like Pearl Harbor up in our house this morning. Did you get home all right last night? Oh, I've got some change for you. Oh. Oh, do you want a coffee or something? Oh, yeah, I'd love a coffee. Do you want aspirin? No, I've had some already. OK, I'll get you a coffee and a bucket. Should I take that? No, I'll just tape it there. I-- I'll pretend. Good morning, Gerry. Thanks very much, Ronnie, you big [inaudible]. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Put that in there. [inaudible] [music playing] Rosie, is that you? Hi, darling. Hi. How is things? - All right. How was school? - OK. - Was it? Yeah. Anything exciting happen? No. No. You good with Rosie? Mmm. ELLIE: Mmm. A little saint I'd say you are. Off you go with Rosie. Rosie. Rosie. Is it really all right? - Yeah. ELLIE: No problems? - No. ELLIE: Great. I'll be down in a second. [inaudible] Boys, look at the flowers. Yeah, lovely. [inaudible] aren't you? I just come out to pick flowers the whole day, yeah. [inaudible]. [inaudible] again. Do you have any good times together? No. Never? Do you never go shopping or out for a rave up or something? No, she can't afford it. So when's the court case? She doesn't talk to me about it. Did they talk to you about, you know, why they are splitting up and-- They just said they were separating. She just blamed dad all the time. Very tough on you, isn't it? Still, you can always come round to our place if things get bad. I like having a girl around-- several of those men ganging up on me all the time. I think you should try and talk to her and get her to listen to you. I can't. I hate her. She needs to pull herself together. If she don't get help soon, she's going to go crazy. [inaudible] tomatoes. We're going to get [inaudible]. Then we'll go and get a Coke after that, all right? Yeah. Hey, Dennis. Hi, Gerry. Give us, uh, you know, four pounds of the [inaudible]. You want spaghetti? GERRY: Yeah, afraid do. It's that time of the month-- and one [inaudible]. HOWARD: Hi, boys. Hi. Hi, Michael, how is your dad? Who is this? Jason. Hi, Jason. What's up then, boys? Where's the camera? What camera? Video camera. Where it always is. What do you want it for? JAKE: For practice. HOWARD: To practice. JAKE: To practice for the film we're making. - You're making a film? - Yeah. What's that then? Some kind of school project? The films then. Creative film studies, yeah. Oh, yeah, what's it about? Bank robbery. HOWARD: Which bank? TSB. Oh, right, that's a good one. Who's the director? It's me, isn't it, boss? You? What do you do, Mike? I'm a bank robber. Oh, right. That's good. That's good. So, uh, have you got some money to do this? You got a budget and that? You don't need a budget. You do need a budget. You don't. We've got the camera-- the film. No, you need some money. You need a budget, because you've got to have some money to hire the camera equipment. Look, I mean, just give us the camera and stop messing around. Thank you, Fabia. Hiya. Hiya. How you doing? Great. And Gerry, this is Tricia. - Hi. - Hiya, Tricia. - Hi. Uh, this is my boy, Joe. - Hiya. - Hi, Joe. We've been doing a bit of Shopping. Yeah, just a bit, yeah .

Waterproof. [inaudible] I'm jealous. Hey. A dummy. [inaudible]. Is it all there? [inaudible] [inaudible] Imagine that in your window. How do you like? Did you put jam in it? Oh, yeah, I forgot the jam. Yep, thank you. [phone ringing] ELLIE: Hiya. Is this a bad time? I was sleeping. Sorry. I woke you up, did I? It's all right. ELLIE: Listen, I can see this is a bad time. I'll go. Oh, it's all right. Are you OK? I'm just tired of everything. I was just going to suggest that Rosie came a coup-- god, you look desperate. Rosie has been awful to me, Elllie. She's rude and aggressive. And now she's gone away now to stay with Bob for the weekend. And I just want to go away somewhere on my own. You two have been around. She lies to me constantly about where she's been, who she's been with-- what she's been doing. And now she's gone off to have this great weekend with Bob, and all I want to do is go to the monastery, and I can't. You want to go to a monastery? Yes, and I can't go because of Rosie. ELLIE: If you wanted to a monastery, I mean, why didn't you go this weekend? Because it's a Buddhist monastery in Hemel Hempstead, and you have to book. But I don't see the problem, and if you wanted to go to a monastery, I mean, surely Rosie can go and stay with a pal. Yeah, well, she can come and stay with us. Well, of course she can come and stay with us. But I don't think that's the answer, do you? Yes, it is the answer. It's exactly what I need. Yeah, I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about Rosie. I'm so grateful, Ellie. Really, I am. And you can't imagine what it's been like for me, you know, living here in this dump. It's so depressing. Right. Well, look, just let me know the dates when you have Rosie. I'm so grateful, Ellie, I really am. There's no need to be grateful. JESS: No, I am all grateful. I mean, you don't know what this is going to mean to me, you know, it's going to change my whole life. ELLIE: Yeah, all right. I can feel it. Thanks, Ellie. Thanks. Thanks. - Bye. Bye. Bye. It's not Michael's-- it's not Michael's fault. That is true. He's had it three days running. No, I haven't. GERRY: Shut up, will you? ELLIE: Listen, if you boys don't stop fighting about that game. I'm going to bury it. Morning all. Hi, Ray. Hiya. Um, here's your milk and your letters. Thanks a million. Do you want a cup of tea? Is it the one with the perfume in it? No, it's not the one with the perfume. Well, I'll have one then. Oh, by the way, um, Roy asked me to give this to you. It's the second installment of our bill. OK. Get yourself a mug, and I'll pour you one. Here's the rest of that film. Any post for me? Why? Are you expecting something? No. GERRY: Look at all these [inaudible]. That's why they pull down rain forests, you know? Do you want the bingo card? ELLIE: Are there more bathroom brushes? I haven't got any in the bathroom. GERRY: Who are Get Holdings? ELLIE: I don't know who Get Holdings are, why? GERRY: "Consultancy fee in connection with building work at 24 Layton Grove per Nunn brothers." 123 quid? Is that your bill? No. GERRY: No, you've got his bill over there. Well, so what's that? "With best regards from Howard Spink?" Yeah, "H. Spink, M. Spink, J. Spink-- getting it together for you." Did you have a consultation with Howard Spink about the bathroom? No. I mean, he recommended the Nunn brothers, that's all. So what's the deal? You get the Nunn brothers. You get Howard Spink as well? Believe me, Jerry. It has nothing to do with us. He said the, um, job was a favor for friends. Some favor, 123 quid. Well, we're not going to pay it. Well, what are we going to do? Just ring him and say we're not going to pay it. Oh, yeah, phone him and tell him we're not-- - OK, I'll ring. - No, give to me. I'll do it. Look. Look, I'm sorry, Ellie, but let me assure you Howard's bill is not connected with the Nunn brothers in any way whatsoever. No, it's not your fault, uh, Ray. He isn't there. No one is there. He's got one of those bloody stupid mobile phones. You haven't got the number, have you? I haven't got it on me. I might have it in the van. I'll go and have a look. Thanks, Roy. Ray. I'm going kill him. Don't say that in front of the kids. He's not going to kill him, boys. GERRY: Yes, I am. I'm going to kill him in front of. Them I'm going to ritually murder him on the table, and cut off his cohones, and sell him to the tapas bars as a delicacy. Did you know they found out that when the average American male dies, he's got five pounds of putrifying red meat in his bowel? Uggh. Still? Go eat your dinner. And this guy knows too many sandwiches and fried breakfast in cafs. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello? Roy, it's Ray. ROY (ON PHONE): What's up? I'm at the McAllister's. Did you know Howard stuck in a bill for 123 quid for a consultancy? They are going berserk down here. Consultancy for what? On the fucking bathroom job we're doing. Do you know anything about it? I know nothing about it. Well, let me tell you, Gerry is doing this now. They've tried phoning him at his office, but they've got no reply. Now they want me to give him his mobile number. No, don't do that. I said I haven't got it. I said I'd look for it in van. Listen, you stay out of it. Give me five minutes. I'll ring Howard to find out what's going on. You just keep out of the way. Keep out of the way? I'm right in the middle of it down here. Listen, I'm telling you, in fucking five minutes, they are getting that number. [phone ringing] HOWARD: Howard Spink. GERRY (ON PHONE): Yeah, hi, uh, it's Gerry McAllister here. Oh, hi, Gerry, how are you today? Listen, I got a bill from you this morning. I can't hear you, Gerry. GERRY (ON PHONE): What? Uh, you're breaking up. Breaking up? You're breaking me up. Ah, yeah, yeah, that's better. It's not a bona fide bill. We're not paying it. And I want you to know that you're out of order. Uh, well, hold on a minute, Gerry. I mean, I came over to your place. I assessed the situation as I saw it, and I passed on to you the benefit of my specialist knowledge. GERRY (ON PHONE): No, you didn't. You only did what anybody would do socially. Huh, well, I'm afraid I don't quite see it like that, Gerry. Look, I-- I gave you my professional advice. You did not give me any professional advice. And as far as the bill goes, you can whistle it for it, buster, because I am very, very angry. Gerry, I consider you a friend. I really don't want to have to take any legal measures on this. GERRY (ON PHONE): I beg your pardon. Listen, I can play that game too, you know, if I have to. And believe me, I'll have you on toast, you big ganch. You're trying to take 123 good-looking smackers out of my pocket. Now, you may live like that, buster, but I don't. Oh, why don't we have a drink and talk about this in a friendly way? I don't want to have a drink with a you, you gobshite. There's nothing to discuss. Now, do you mind? This is a business phone. Oh, come on, Gerry. I know exactly how you feel. My grandmother was Irish. I'm a Celt. Ah, just knock off the references to racial origins, will you? You big big, limy bastard. I've got to go now. This phone is needed for urgent council business. [whistle] People like the McAllister's have got to understand that my professional expertise has put them in touch with the best builders in North London, and that's you. And my skill has to be paid for. I'm afraid Ray doesn't see it that way. HOWARD: Yeah, well, I'm very worried about Ray's attitude to this, I can tell you. It seems to me he's taking their point of view rather than ours. I think he'd find it a lot easier. See? Our point of view if that money you owed us was forthcoming. Oh, hi, Linda. Oh, hi. ROY: If you could see your way to actually giving us it, it'd get Ray off my back. And life in the garden would be rosy again. Right. Hey, Linda, you should meet Roy. He's an identical twin. Oh, really? Hello. I've got a friend who's doing some really interesting work on identical twins. Are you still in contact? Yeah, he's my brother. We're partners. We-- we do a little bit of work for Howard. Would you be interested in helping my friend in his work? No, no, no. I don't think so, no. Had enough of that at school. We were forever being dragged out of class and stuck in the library with some twerp of an educational psychologist and asked silly questions. I remember once this bloke-- he had a packet of Roundtree's fruit pastels, and they were all black like they are my favorites-- they Ray's. I wish you wouldn't do that. HOWARD: What is that? Tell people I'm a twin. It's all they ever want to talk about. Yeah, well, normally, I wouldn't do that. But you know, that's her field. She's an educational psychologist. I'm an individual. What exactly, uh, you know, did they want to talk about when they gave you the black sweets? Well, they were mostly interested in the fact that Ray is the eldest. How do you mean the eldest? He's 57 minutes older than I am. He got all the responsibility. He used to get the carry-to-dinner money to school. He had Thunderbird 1, like that horrible green thing. I used to have to get in his dirty bathwater. It got on my nerves. You married? Yeah, I'm married-- happily. Got a little three-year-old daughter called Elaine, and I've got one on the way. Oh, great. When's it due? Um, two weeks time. Sure it's not twins? No, we've had a scan, and it's a definitely a singleton. Hi, Ellie. Oh, hi, Jess. Hi. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Good. Oh, hello. Hello. How are you? Very well, thank you. Nice to see you again. Do you two know each other? Yeah, now he's doing some work down at my fat, preparing the window frames. Oh, that would be Roy. I've got you a present. Do you? It's a remedy. A remedy for what? Well, it's a remedy for despair. I thought you looked really depressed when you came around. So I mixed this up for you myself. And what you do is you put about three drops in a glass of water and take it three times a day, OK? It's a gift. Thank you. JESS: It's also a little thank-you present for having Rosie for the weekend when I go away to the monastery. Cheerio, ladies, I'm off now. OK. I'll say hello to Roy for you. - OK. - Bye. Bye. Have you talked to Rosie about the weekend? Well, I haven't actually talked to her about it yet. But, uh, it will be fine, Ellie, I mean, she adores coming around here, you know? She's quite miserable at the moment, you know, Rosie. Yes, yes, I think you're right. I think she is miserable. But, uh, she's got an awful lot on her plate at the moment, Ellie. No, I think she's miserable, because she feels cut off from you. But how could she feel cut off from me? I mean, we're together 24 hours a day. We're very close-- me and Rosie. You know, I mean, we're like friends. We're like sisters almost. Well, that's it's not the impression I get. Well, what has she been saying? I think that she feels that you are very angry at the moment. Well, I am angry-- yes, but I'm not angry with her. And you're angry with him. Well, of course I'm angry with him. You'd be angry if you were in my situation. Well, maybe all this anger is driving her away. Look, Ellie, if what you're saying is you don't want Rosie to come and stay, that's fine. I understand that. I know she can be very difficult. She's being a bit of a problem at the moment. She's not difficult at all. That's not what I was saying. Of course she can come for the weekend. Well, what are you saying? Have you ever thought of talking to someone about your feelings-- about Bob, and Rosie, and all that? I talk about it all the time. I talk to my mother about it. I talk to you about it. No, I mean, someone who's qualified to help. You mean a doctor? I'm not ill. Well, maybe not a doctor. I mean, there are lots of people who are trained to help someone in your situation-- counselors, therapists. Ellie, I am not ill. Well, you are not exactly well, Jess. I mean, the last time I saw you, you were comatose. It's fine for you, isn't it, Ellie? Sitting here in your fabulous house with your perfect husband and your wonderful children. How would you know about someone in my situation? Well, I don't have to sit here and be patronized by you. I'll tell you something, Ellie. In all the time we've known other, you've never once thought about me-- my needs, my wants. And I'll tell you something else-- I don't need the help. You need the help. You need the help for your-- you selfish bitch. Everything OK? No, it's not. Uh, is Ellie in. [buzzer] A friend of yours? Oh, hello, Howard. HOWARD: Hi, Ellie. Uh, is Ray here? No, he's gone. Ah, right, OK. Well, listen, uh, I've been speaking to Gerry, and he seems he's overreacted to me sending in his bill. I don't think he's overreacted one bit. HOWARD: Uh, well, I think he has. He was very abusive to me on the phone. He actually called me gobshite. You see, I don't think you understand quite the way things are done in this town. You obviously haven't had any work done on your house for some time. And I think you have to understand that if you want access to certain facilities, then you have to pay for my services. Listen, Howard, I don't want to talk about this anymore. Yeah, I have to collect this money. I owe it to my family. It is my living. Oh, don't give me that. Right, well, I already spoke to Gerry and told him that I may have to have recourse to legal action. I just wanted to tell you that if I say I'm going to do that, then I will definitely do it. You haven't got a legal leg to stand on. Well, I think I have. But apart from that, uh, I think you should consider your reputation. I don't think it would be a good thing for Michael if you are known as the type people who don't pay their bills. Exactly what are you threatening? Oh, I'm not threatening anything. But you know how kids talk. Howard, you are a gobshite. Hey, Pascal. PASCAL: Hello, boss. Give me one of those Budweisers. Cheers. 2. So what have the McAllisters done to upset you? Well, we just had a bit of an argument. You seemed very hurt. Yes, I am. Do you want to tell me about it? Well, it's personal really. Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, I just don't like other people telling me how to run my life, you know, especially when I don't know anything about it. Yeah, right, me neither. So, um, what was your trouble? Well, not to put too fine a point on it. They owe me some money. What for? I organized some work being done on their house. In the bathroom? Yeah, right. Roy and Ray. The Nunns. Have you met them? Yeah, well, one of them, Roy, he's done some work on my flat. Oh, right. Where is that exactly? Wilmot Road. 82-A? Yeah. Howard Spink? I'm your landlord. [inaudible]. Hello. How are you? What a small world. And you are? I'm Jess. Jess. Um-- Jess Kennedy. Kennedy, right. Yes, uh, a slightly strange situation. Um, I don't get to meet people. So it's very nice to meet a tenant in the flesh. What was Roy doing around your place? Oh, he's mending my window frames, because they're rotting. - All right. Everything OK? Yeah, he's done a bit of work on it, and, um, he says he's going to come back and finish it. Yeah. Says a special priority on 82-A and Wilmot Road. That is Mrs. Kennedy. Miss. Miss Kennedy per Roy Nunn, check the window frames are in order. We'll take care of that for you. Thanks. What are you doing now? Well, actually, I'm working in the natural health center just down the road. No, I mean, you know, where are you going this afternoon. I'm just going home. Well, I'm going to go up your way. So maybe I could give you a ride and maybe pop in and have a look at the flat and give me an opportunity to see things first hand. Is that a good idea? OK. All right. Excuse me. Do you have a pound coin? Um, yeah. Oh, yeah. Thanks. - All right. I'll be a second. You banged them walls, right? Yeah, right. I knock nails in the pieces of wood, and behold, there's a cupboard. What does he do? He gets his work. That's what he does. He owes us 1,200 quid. That's what he does. He sends nasty little bills to his so-called friends. That's what Howard does. Roy, come on. I've told you before. His bill to the McAllisters has nothing to do with us. He gives the Nunn brothers a bad name being involved with him. Are you a complete idiot? Don't get personal-- business is business. What about that estimate? He's using our name to nick untold amounts of money from the building society. And he's moving it from one dodgy account to another. He has no intention of doing that extension or to put in any money our way. Don't get so wound up. I can deal with him. And there's another thing I don't like about him. He don't talk to me properly, Oh, don't be silly. He talks to me as if I was an inmate of Rampton Mental Hospital. And if I am the intelligent one, where does that leave, you, Roy? I'm going to sort him out. HOWARD: Shit. Yeah, OK, OK, I'll be there. JESS: Did you get some bad news? HOWARD: No, no. It's just business [inaudible]. JESS: How about you come later? HOWARD: Hey, listen, it was [inaudible]. JESS: Yeah, yeah, it was. HOWARD: I'll bill you. JESS: OK. Excuse me. [door slam] RAY: Roy, why don't you come with us? I can't. I've got to go home. Then I've got to got to Earl's Court. I'm going anyway. You suit yourself. I'll see you tomorrow. [scream] Hey, Roman Polanski, what are you planning? [inaudible] Hello, what are you doing? What is this bloody noise? What are you doing? Look, I've got most of it. It's not going to come down. Look at it on the camera. - Get it out. - Look, just a minute. Mrs. Spink? Yes. Is Howard in? No. Any idea when he'll be back? About 8:00 or 9:00, I suppose. No, do you want to leave a message? Yeah, you can tell him that Gerry McAllister called. I'm Michael's father. Just tell them I'm going to knock his block off. OK? [music playing] Hi, Gerry. - Hello, Roy/Ray. Right. I bet I know why you're here. Are you Mrs. Spink? - Yeah, hi, Roy. Ray. Ray Nunn. Nunn Brothers builders. - Oh, the twin. - That's right. Is your husband in? No. He won't be back till 9 o' clock. Do you want to leave a message? Do you want to leave it with me? I'll wait. HOWARD: Hi, Roy. Ray. Gerry, it's a nice surprise. Howard. Spink, I want a word with you. Listen, you stop annoying my wife and threatening my kid, or I-- I didn't do that, Gerry. You go around there again under any pretext, and I'll knock your block off, all right? Yeah, that's right. We won that 1,200 pounds that you owe. Yeah, just hold on a minute, boys. In 35 minutes, my house is going to be repossessed. MRS. SPINK: What? Yeah, sorry. So we've got a few things to take care of. Excuse me. Jake. JAKE: Yeah? Get up here. JAKE: All right. We got to play that game again where we change houses. What game? Just grab everything. Hey, don't forget the kennel this time, Linda. All right. Look, if you guys want to help yourself to a couple of beers, there's plenty in the fridge in my den. Come on, Michael, we're going home. Oh, Gerry. Yeah? You are coming tonight, aren't you? Tonight? You know, the salsa night. Oh, shit, yeah. Uh, I forgot all about it. Um, I can't. Um, just because, uh-- I mean it would just be nice if you did. I mean, I-- I'd like you to be there. Yeah, I'd like to go. But, uh, it's just I said I'd, um, mind the boys tonight. Um, but I'd like to change it, really. Oh, well. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll all bond very successfully without me being there. [phone ringing] Oh. [phone ringing] Yes, hello? WINIFRED (ON PHONE): Hi, Ellie, it's Winifred. Oh, hi, Winifred. How are you?

But you gave me a card don't you remember in the pub? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Howard, look you've got to come here, please, right now. There's a locksmith here. He's changing my locks, Howard, right this minute. I mean, what's happening? I paid my rent. Yeah, that's right. What's happening? What's happening? I ask myself that question every day. I mean, you know, this thing is global. Canary Walk is just the tip of the iceberg. I thought you liked me, Howard. - We've got it. - No, Rosie, please, please. Wait. Howard, please, you've got to come down here and save me, all right? I'll tell you what I'll do. You put your phone down, and I'll make a call, and I'll get right back to you, OK? JESS (ON PHONE): No. All right, bye. JESS (ON PHONE): Howard. [beep] [playing piano] ELLIE: Gerry, I'm leaving now. For good? ELLIE: Yeah. OK. ELLIE: Make sure Joey's [inaudible]. All right.

Oh, no. 28. Yeah, so that's when you're going to win. Yeah. [music playing] Oh, listen, this will make you laugh. I was told yesterday that I was a selfish bitch married to the perfect husband. Who said that? A friend. Well, he must have something, I suppose. He makes me laugh. Yeah. That's just his way of keeping you in your place-- keeping a good woman down. [music playing] Have to get Gerry down here. Belfast men don't dance. Hey, princess, give me a dance, eh? Sorry. Sorry. Oh, look at my sleeping beauty. Hiya. Hiya. Oh.

OK? - Sure, you're very welcome. It's quite comfortable, actually. [hiccup]. Good night? The best. There was dancing. I thought you were going for a meal. Yeah, we were. It was a dance floor. We danced the night away. What kind of dancing? It was a limerick? It was bit more exotic-- salsa dancing. Oh, yeah. Do you know what salsa dancing is? I've heard of it. Hot stuff. It was great, wasn't it? Well, you certainly enjoyed yourselves-- a right little mover there really. You should have been there, Gerry. They were like flies to a jam pot. I got called princess. By a frog. Big biceps for a frog. You're pissed as a fiddlers bitch. I hope you didn't drive home like that. I left the car there. I thought I was too drunk to drive. Where did you leave it? Camden High Street. Oh, very nice. [inaudible]. Oh, it gets better. It'll be towed away. Do you know how much that will cost? Expensive night out. No, it won't be towed away. I'll go and pick it up in the morning. You won't be fit to get in the morning. Do you want a drink? Yeah. I wasn't speaking to you. You've had quite enough for one evening. Winnifred, what can I get you? I'd love a whiskey, please. GERRY: OK, would you like something in it? Ice would be nice. OK, in an ideal world, if I was going to give you a drink, what would it be? In an ideal world, it will be an [inaudible] please. OK, let's see what we can do. What? A teensy weensie bit jealous maybe. Not at all. Do you think so really? WINIFRED: Hmm. Great. I think it was the biceps that did it. He didn't have biceps. He was skinny as a rake. Who puts ice containers in the freezer without putting water in them? Sorry, no ice. It's OK. ELLIE: Don't look at me. Small one for you. You're not having one? GERRY: You know I never touch the stuff. Huh, it's going [inaudible]. Slows you up. Give me the car keys. Where are you going? Where do you think I'm going? To get the car? Yeah, I'll buzz down on the bike. Give me the keys. You're the best. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No big deal. Thanks. Don't drink too much. Oh, listen-- [inaudible] GERRY: [inaudible]. [laughing] Stop it. Shh. Shh. She's going to hear. You love me really, don't you. Of course I love you. Look at all the things I do for you. You're a saint-like human being, you are. I know. But you needn't worry. I'll never, ever remind you that I went the way to Camden on my bike to rescue the car you abandoned. I would have gone and got it the morning. You wouldn't have, granny. You'd never got up. I would so. 8 o'clock in the morning and not a Rice Krispie poured. So who's the guy with the biceps? Hmm? Someone who recognized my princess-like qualities. I have biceps too, you know? Oh, I know you have, darling. Well, I have bicycle clips, as you well know. You said you weren't going to remind me. Didn't know you were out there writing. You didn't read it, did you? Yeah. But don't be embarrassed. I thought it was very good. I thought it was very funny. Did you really? Yeah. That guy in the story-- is that supposed to be me? No. He hasn't got your wit, has he? No, that's true. That is me though, isn't it. I know. It's entirely fictional. You are. You are. Are you asleep? Mmm. Night, Nellie. Night, Gerry. [music playing]
