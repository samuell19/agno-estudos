And as you also know each year we have a special lottery just to liven up the event. The way it works is that five senior MVPs of Roosevelt's winning football team will accompany the five senior cheerleaders. Couples were matched at random, and each will enjoy free tickets to the dance. And the lucky couples are... Kepner Dulcick and Karen Sybern. - Oh, man. - Shut up. Gus Ulensky and Cathy Bennario. Randy Daniels and... ...uh, Mary Pat Sykes. Scott Metcalf and Monica Johnson. And Johnny Rourke and Tracey Prescott. - Did you hear that? - Holy shit! What the hell happened? I fixed it myself.

Just come inside, okay? [indistinct chatter] [siren wailing] [machinery rumbling] [indistinct chatter] John, I'm sorry. Its alright. [male #11] Let us pray. "With faith in Jesus Christ we reverently bring the body of our brother to be buried in it's human imperfection. Let us pray with confidence to God who gives life to all things. May we raise up this mortal body to the perfection and company of the saints. May God give him a merciful judgment and forgive all his sins. May Christ, the good shepherd, lead him safely home to be at peace with God, our father. And may he be happy forever with all the saints and the presence of the eternal king. Our prayers are now ended. And we bid our last farewell. There is sadness in the parting but it should fill us with new hope. And one day, we shall see our brother again. And enjoy his love. By God's mercy we who leave this cemetery today in sorrow will be reunited in the joy of God's kingdom. - Let us comfort one another. - Johnny. In the faith of Jesus Christ." - It's okay. - I know.
