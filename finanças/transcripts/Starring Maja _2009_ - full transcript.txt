I've always loved being on stage. It might sound strange, but... somehow it's only then that I feel like myself. It's like that's where I belong. In the spotlight. That's me. No... There. I was playing a tree stump. It was a speaking part - a magic stump. I've played other roles too. But there are no photos of those as Mom didn't have a camera... and Dad didn't come to watch that often. But there's more to come. This is just the beginning. Turn it off! Sorry, I blanked out. I didn't know what to say. Maja, it all depends on you now. You've got the lead role. OK? THREE WEEKS EARLIER I'm throwing the bouquet now! Hey... Annika? -Erika. -Erika. -There's food left if you're hungry. -Thanks, I'd love some. Then maybe we can deduct a little from your bill. It must be a cool job filming weddings all the time. Yeah, it's great. But it's temporary. I'm a documentary filmmaker really. Oh, really? For TV? I'm trying to learn how to mingle, but I'm not so good at it. I hate weddings. -Are you married? -Me? No. I've got so many projects going on, so I'm focusing on my creative side. Oh, me too. It's better to be single. You can like... focus on your art. Hi. I didn't dare say this before. But my name's Maja Ingmarsson and I was wondering if you needed someone for your next film... then I can do it. I'm an actress, though I've never done a documentary. But I reckon I can do it as I'm quite versatile. Not for money, though, it'll just be fun to be involved. Here's my phone number in Alingsås. It looks like a 7 there at the end but it's a 1. So it ends with 1-5, not 7. ...best wishes. And, as I said... I had prepared well, but now I'll have to keep it short, you'll be glad to hear. And so I'd like to welcome Malin into the family. -Let's raise our glasses. Cheers! -Cheers! I've heard that you have plans to move abroad... CULTURAL JOB CENTER Hi. I'm Erika Sohlman. We met at a wedding... -Were you the one filming? -Yes, that's right. You must've thought I was a real weirdo. No, that's what I found interesting. No, there is no way of knowing if it'll be on TV... ...so I start filming you and we'll see where that leads. And you must be honest and let me in to your work... -School? How old are you? -I'm nine... twen... eighteen. OK. You're not a minor anyway. I've got no funding sorted, nothing. I don't even know where I would stay in Alingsås. You can stay here! We've got a lovely little guest room. It's a bit wardrobe-like, though. Mom, I'm going to be on TV! Shall we start? -So how was school today? -Be natural. I am being natural. This isn't my first film, you know. I was in The White Lionness too. -When was that? Five years back? -Twelve. I played opposite Rolf Lassgård. We shot this scene... We all got into an elevator, and then... then we got out again. But it was cut from the film. But then I snuck round the back to look at the TV screen where they'd recorded everything. And there I see, on the screen... that for a short while there, I actually blocked out Rolf Lassgård! Well, Erika, that was something, let me tell you. Not bad, huh? Blocking out Rolf Lassgård. MAJA'S MOM Is that for TV? Are you a movie star? Welcome to Alingsås. An apple. Hot coal! I like drama class. But I'm the only one who takes it seriously. Who really puts my heart into it. -A soap. Oh, I dropped it. -What the...? Spider. Are you OK? Yeah... It's just that I'm scared of spiders. Maja is rather special. She gets completely... involved in whatever she's doing. And... she wants to be an actress. But this is a hobby group where the main object is to have fun. We don't really have the capacity for her here. She takes up a lot of space. I mean, not physically, but... I just mean the group maybe thinks she's a bit too much. What are you doing? -Sorry, is it yours? -Yes... It's pretty. Thanks. Where did you buy it? I got it as a present, from my brother in Stockholm. Oh. See you. Bye. -What did she say? -She just asked about my jacket. -Why? -She thought it was pretty. “How will this suit?” “How will this suit?” “How will this suit?” “He loves her dearly. And I, poor monster, fond as much on him.” “He loves her dearly.” “He loves her dearly.” “And I, poor monster, fond as much on him.” “And she seems to dote on me. What will become of this?” “As I am man, my state is desperate for Orsino's love.” “As I am woman, what thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!” “As I am woman, what thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!” “O time! Thou must untangle this, not I.” “It is too hard a knot for me to untie.” I think Maja has a lot to offer. It'll be thought-provoking, moving and funny. -You mean we should laugh at her? -No, no... I think people will relate to her. I mean, I was a bit of a weirdo myself when I was growing up. Though that might be hard to believe now... It's about taking on obstacles, appearance, prejudice... I see no entertainment value in it. -I don't get why you don't get it. -I still don't get the message. You've also got dreams, haven't you? RECEIVED YOUR PROGRAM... ...NOT ABLE TO INVEST This sounds really interesting. Really. It's perfect timing. -Seriously? -Yeah, sure. That's great! I knew it was! So what do you want to be? -Orsino. -Orsino. -Anyone else wants to be Orsino? -No. Good. There. Let's see... I'd like to play Viola. OK. Does anyone else want to play Viola? Yes, I do. This is how I see it: Viola has a twin brother, so we need two people who look alike. That's what would be most believable. -Do you have a second choice? -No. The first year, I only had two lines. Last year I had to play a guy. So it's my turn to get a good part. Look, we're doing this as a group. What does it matter who plays what? So why don't you take another part? Well, there are many good parts in this play. Why is it so important for you to play Viola? Because... -Because... I can relate to her. -So you like to dress up as a guy? No. But I know what it's like to be someone other than who you look like. We'll just have to vote on it. Well, I've got two votes for Maja, and... eight votes for Nathalie. I'm really sorry... but that's democracy for you. Malvolio is a great role, really. He's funny, he's got tons of lines. He's hilarious. You'll be brilliant as Malvolio. Exactly. I'm not disappointed. It might have seemed so before, but I'm not. I... There are no bad roles, only bad actors. -Oscar? -No, I don't want any. Is it a big part you've got? Yes. I'm playing a really funny role. Malvolio - one of the main characters-- -Will you have time left for studying? -Yes. Because you have to think of your future as well. That's what I'm doing. I've seen a bit. And Maja is actually very gifted. Really? What's so remarkable about her? -Göran... -I mean... She's remarkable to me, of course, as she's my daughter. I mean, objectively. MAJA'S DAD It's almost disability humor! Hilarious stuff. More of that. I totally dig it. Really, I do. Hey. I've just thought of a title. Phat. Great, huh? It's got a double meaning. Phat as in “cool”, and Phat as in... Well, fat. Funny. This is costing me a lot of money, and there's a lot of interest in this. -So I thought we could sign a contract. -Listen, we're not quite there yet. She's a freak, and that's funny, people like that. But... To compete with all the other nutters on TV, in Big Brother and so on... it needs a bit of a twist. You feel me? But I understand if this wasn't exactly your vision. Perhaps it'd be better for you to go to someone else. Think about it. OK? -Well, hello! -Hi! Long time no see! -Do you know each other? -Yes, we... We did a film course together before I got into the Dramatic Institute. -Or rather we... -Well, that's water under the bridge. It was a long time ago. Martin will be directing our new comedy series. Oh, really? Oh, you've got a sense of humor? What are you doing here? Looking for work? No, no. I'm making a documentary. That's great. For Millimeter? -Yes. -I thought you were into fiction. No, you can't compete with reality. Feature films just seem so fake. How'd it go? Hi. How'd it go? Yes, the meeting. Oh, that... It went well. Well? Hi. My n-name's Maja Ingmarsson. I found you on the internet. I was wondering that if I wanted to be in-- It said that you-- It said that you make-- Excuse me. That you work with TV and film and I was wondering if I-- if I wanted-- If I wanted to be in-- If I wanted to-- I mean, what should... It's the switchboard. A CV? Is that some kind of letter? Yes, I've made a lot of films. But not in a professional context. But I have a friend who's been helping me out. I'm in a drama group, you see, and we perform loads. Is that-- Does that count? Or shall I write... Should I-- “Casting”? Is that spelled like it sounds? Thank you, yes, goodbye. Oh my God! SOCIAL WORKER UNEMPLOYMENT I recommend that the day after graduation you register at the job center. Even if you're not intending to get a job your benefits count from the day you register. So start accumulating qualifying days right away. And when you get there, you'll speak to a-- I don't know how many times I've said this. No cell phones in class! Oh my God, it's mine! -I've got to take this. -Okay. Maja speaking... Yes? Hang on, I'll just get some paper... Nine... Nine o'clock Thursday. No problem, I can remember that. OK. Yes, it's... Of course, definitely! Shall I wear something special? No, of course. It's no problem at all. Thank you very much. Thanks. Bye, thanks. Yes! Yes! A TV company called me from Stockholm. They're making a new TV series. One of the actors had to drop out. So... they asked me if I wanted to cover for them. -You're kidding! -No! So anyway, my question is... I know it's short notice, it's next Thursday. So the thing is I'll miss a rehearsal. So would it be OK if I missed it? -Of course! -I don't want to let the group down. -What's the series? -It's a new comedy series. It's called “Chit-Chat.” But I can't say more, it's secret. -Is it a big role? -No, it's just one episode. -But anyway, that's so cool! -How did you get it? I sent in an application. -You think they need more people? -I can ask. -What should we write? -What did you say? I mean... Pinch me! This is just-- too good to be true. Offering you a part just like that... They haven't seen you, haven't seen you act. They needed someone quickly. Are you sure it's a speaking part? Maybe it's just as an extra. -It's not as an extra. -Erika, is this really how things work? Yes. If it's short notice, I guess... Maybe. Don't forget that Stockholm's a big city. There are junkies there who could stick a needle in you when you go past. And don't walk through unlit parks, OK? And don't travel on those tram things that go underground when it's dark, OK? -Are you filming? -No, I'm just checking the settings. -Here's some emergency money. -Mom... Darling, I know you're all grown up, but you're still my little honeybun. Mom, we're going away for one day. Maja... Maja... Hi. Hi. I was thinking... You're off to Stockholm, and... My brother lives there. I haven't seen him for ages. So I was wondering if I could tag along. If you're driving there, one extra person won't cost any more. What do you say? I had, like, four hours of sleep. But... -Are you nervous? -No. What time is it? -Twenty-five minutes to. -He's forgotten. -Can't you honk the horn? -We'll wake the whole street. So what? What does it matter? Boring little people. We'll be doing them a favor! They'll have something to talk about! Yeah, they'd talk about that for a week! Hi! Drive! Drive! What happened? Why were you hiding? I didn't tell anyone I was going. Why not? It's my half-brother, so it's a bit sensitive. I've got a half-brother too. Really? There's not much to say about it. He's completely uninteresting. -Isn't it annoying being filmed? -No, why? To never be left alone. Everyone can see what you're doing. Isn't that why we do things - to be seen? -But some things must be private. -Like what? I don't know... Your bad sides, I guess. There's a problem with my card. The magnetic strip, or something. -Do either of you have some cash? -Yes, sure. Here. Thanks, Maja. I'll pay you back. -Don't worry about it. -Thanks. ...at the tryouts for acting school, I thought I'd play Miss Julie. It's a strong part... and very emotional. I've a deal with my Dad, he's like: “You get good grade, you get car.” WELCOME TO STOCKHOLM -Where do you want to go? -Downtown. Downtown? You mean like Sergels torg? -No. Östermalm. -OK. -Is this good for you? -Yeah, sure. -Östermalm's over there. -I know. -You got my address, right? -Yep. -Good luck today. -Thanks. You too. -I mean it was nice riding with you. -You too. Hi, you must be Maja. I'm Pauline, we spoke on the phone. Hi. This is Martin, our director. -Hi. Martin. -Maja. -Hi. -Hi. Come with me, and I'll set you up in the dressing room. -Thanks for the help. She's perfect. -Good. Thank you. We were in deep shit. The other girl dropped out once she saw the script. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Here. What...? “...A FAT, GROTESQUE, UGLY GIRL...” Oh, God, sorry. I really should have explained. -You'll have tons of makeup. -Oh. You'll be unrecognizable. People will see it's you, but you'll look different. Oh. Well... -I've done this kind of thing before. -So it's OK? Yeah, sure. -It's fun to play around a bit. -Yes. It's true, I read it in the papers. The internet is dangerous! There's gangs, and the Mafia and porn... -You'll be chewed up! -Come on, Mom. I'll show you. “The chance of being hacked or getting a virus increases without a firewall.” -That doesn't mean-- -Virus! And I've just had the flu! Did anyone mention porn? No. Go to bed, Grandpa. There's an ugly old hag in my bed! That's Grandma. Oh... Oh. I guess she'll have to do then. I'm going to call a construction company, they'll come and build some firewalls. Until then, the computer's going into the garage, that's final! But mom! There will be no more clicking the mouse! Cut. -Good enough? -Yes. OK, so that's it for scene three. We're moving on to scene four. -Wow! What a difference! Ready? -I think so. Good. Let's go. When you hear the doorbell, that's you. And you'll hear Micke's line before, so just be ready. -Am I happy? -Er, yes. You're really happy. -You can drag him out at the end. -Drag? I should drag him? Yes, drag. -How...? -Take his hand and drag him with you. -The whole way? -The whole way. Exactly. Episode two, scene four, take one! And action! OK, we're alone. Tell me about your date! There's not much to tell. Although she seems pretty damn hot! She likes sushi! -Do you have a photo? -No, but she described herself. Five foot five, long brown hair and blue eyes. So I had the computer generate a composite sketch. -Is that possible? -Sure. It's the same technique the police use. Completely foolproof. -This is what she looks like. -Wow! Shit! -Good job! -Thanks! She's here. Hey. Don't wait up. W-w-what was that? Open it again. -Are you Micke Fredriksson? -No, you've got the wrong house. It says Fredriksson on the mailbox. It does, doesn't it... Sorry, of course you've got the right place! This is Micke! Micke... He's a bit shy and nervous about meeting you. Hi, Micke. Fancy a bit of sushi? Come on, then. This explains why so many crimes go unsolved! Cut. Come on, let's go. I'd almost forgotten. What? This. Maja, there's nothing wrong with you. “Micke opens the door, and sees a fat, grotesque, ugly girl.” That's not you, Maja, that's a role. I didn't even have to change clothes. I just want to get out of here. Look, Maja, come sit down. I won't let them see you like this. Listen, you're great. And cute and talented. Can't you see that? No. Listen. Maja, listen. I'm done filming for today. Screw that. Let's do something together. Just you and me. Maybe we can go to the amusement park. Have you ever been there? Would you like to? We have to talk, it's important. I don't want to do this. Call or text me as soon as you get this. This is Erika Sohlman. Well, take care. And tell Emily I said hi. -Oh, that's right, we're getting married. -Really. Congratulations. It's this May, and it's going to be a film theme. Emily saw your ad in the Wedding Guide and I was wondering if you'd be able to film us. -Why did you say yes? -Otherwise, he'd think I'm not over him. -Are you? -Of course! If I'd said no, he'd have thought I wouldn't be able to cope with it. I didn't want to give him the pleasure. His ego's big enough as it is. I'll be super professional, and he'll realize I don't give a shit about him. -I need the money too. -I've got money. You can have that. -Seriously, take it. -Stop it. You know how it is. No... Well, I suppose I do. Come on. Tell me! When I was fourteen... I made out with this guy. So how was that? I mean, it was OK, but... then his friend came in and went: “What are you doing?” And he was like: “Well, I needed someone to practice on!” Shit, what an asshole! What did you do? Tell him to piss off? No. Or rather... No. I mean, I also needed someone to practice on! You can't be that tragic! I can't take it! ...and fighting but I have to cut all that stuff out. 'Cause they don't want the truth, they want an illusion that it was the happiest day of their lives. I have a theory about this. Every little girl dreams of being a princess, right? Then they grow up and realize it'll never happen. So they get married instead, since that's the closest they'll ever get -What's wrong? -Nothing! -Afraid the junkies will get you? -No. Out of order. As usual. It's OK, it's me. It's me. You scared me half to death! I was supposed to meet my brother... but there was a misunderstanding, as there usually is with him. He thought we were meeting up next week. We'll have to do it some other time. He's out of town now, anyway. You can sleep here. There's only one bed but there are these. -That's fine, we can huddle up! -Yeah, we can do that. How was your TV thing today? Did it go well? Yeah, it went well. I had on tons of makeup, so you won't be able to tell it's me. -But I don't mind. -Ok. What part did you get to play? It was a tiny role. I just said, like: “Hi, come on, let's go.” I've just realized I've got no breakfast in the house. -I'll just pop down to get some milk. -What, now? You can drink some wine... Change the music if you want to. -I'll be right back. -Okay. Hi. I don't want to do this. Not this way. -Why not? -Why not? You know why. -You read the script-- -I can't do this to her. Can I ask you something? Do you think she's stupid? -No, I don't. -Me neither. She has to know why we chose her. You think she's some kind of freak. She's got so much more. That's what I want to film. I'm giving you a chance here. A chance to get into the media business. Next time, you can call the shots. Right now, no one knows who you are. -You haven't even gone to film school. -I'm not going to change my mind. What if I send you a big fat advance. 50,000? OK, this is what I'll do. I'll send you an offer anyway. You can think it over. No beer then? What's the matter? -See you tomorrow, then. -Yeah. I was thinking... I'd rather no one found out that I went with you to Stockholm. -So please don't tell anyone. -No, of course. -It's not-- -I understand. There's no need for you to be embarrassed. Maja, I didn't mean it like that. Maja! Maja, darling, welcome home! Oh, how I've been waiting for you. How are you, sweetheart? Now you have to tell me everything! I'm so curious! This is so exciting! TV has such a huge impact! Everyone will get to see it. Everyone will get to see you! This is great! “Eva's daughter was on TV yesterday, and the rerun is on Saturday." Isn't that great! I read about it in the papers you know. -Which episode are you in? -I don't know. -I'll need to check for my colleagues. -Have you told them? Of course I have. What do you think? Everyone knows. Maja... Let's go in here. GUNILLA'S XL FASHION No way. I'd rather go to the graduation naked! -Stop it. -I'm not going in there. Maja, cut it out. Gunilla's right there. I don't want to go in there. I feel so embarrassed now, with Gunilla there-- CULTURAL JOB CENTER You have to register with the normal job center. But then I'd have to look for normal jobs! To be registered here you have to work with culture. But I am! I make documentaries! -And how many have you made? -Well, the last one-- Paid jobs I mean. And weddings don't count. This is ridiculous. You're meant to help people. I pay your salary, for fuck's sake! -Hi. Good of you to be on time! -Hi. -I wouldn't want to miss this. -No. -I'm going to get ready. Coming? -Soon. Just a little briefing first. Hi. OK, so I've drawn up a storyboard here for you. You don't have to follow it to the letter, but it's logical. Start with full length shots, then medium shots, close-up of the kiss, obviously. -There you are. Any questions? -No. Great. Oh, and one more thing - because we have a theme, I want the complete look. Everyone must be in costume. So I've got you this. No. No way, Martin. I can't work in that. OK, look. I'll give you 1,000 kronor. One thousand. DEBT COLLECTION FINAL NOTICE MILLIMETRE PRODUCTIONS AGREES TO PAY ERIKA SOHLMAN SEK 50,000... I'm sorry. Here she comes! Sweetheart! -What's all this? -A premiere party. You haven't forgotten, have you? Everyone's here. There's Bittan and Anki, from work. And Jerker, my chiropractor, And today even Dad managed to drag himself over here. And then there's Lena and Oscar. You've complained that I show no interest, but I'm here now! -I'm so thrilled! -Maja, I was going to make a cake, but then I thought that wasn't very healthy. So I made a fruit salad. But not any old fruit salad - It's a fruit salad with star fruit! Because you're our movie star! Please, help yourselves! Maja? Maja, wait. What is it? You can't leave now. -But I don't want to. -Don't want to? You can't just say that. You have no idea how hard it was to invite-- -I don't want them here! -Not so loud! This is Micke! Micke... He's a bit shy and nervous about meeting you. Hi, Micke. Fancy some sushi? Come on, then. How embarrassing. How was the sushi? The sushi? It was more like whale meat! -It was nice anyway. -Thank you. -Yes, very nice. Good salad. -Yeah, it was very good. I think this has been a good evening. Maja has very high expectations. And that's not so good. She gets disappointed easily. I mean... I think that she's been on TV. And that is good. It's good to have on your CV... when applying for other jobs, and stuff. I mean, you have to be realistic. I know she'll never be a big star. But how do you say something like that to your child? I think we should stop filming. Can you stop filming?! Stop! Do you agree with her? About me? No. That's the important thing. It doesn't matter what other people think. They... They see me as some kind of joke. But it doesn't matter. Because when your film's finished, everyone will understand the real me. What is the matter, Malvolio? Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. The letter did come to his hands and commands shall be executed. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? To bed! Ay, sweetheart, and I'll come to thee. God comfort thee. Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft? How do you do, Malvolio? Continue. You're doing great. How do you do, Malvolio? I mean... What's the point? Can someone explain it to me? -It's the funniest scene in the play! -Funny? He thinks she loves him. But they've just been fooling him. Ha ha, how hilarious. It's obvious that no one can love a person like that. Maja! Maja! Maja! What's the matter? Careful, someone might see you. That would be embarrassing. -It's not like that. -You're such a liar! You're ashamed of me. You can't even say you were with me in Stockholm. I mean, not “with me” in that way. -What is all this? -He went to see his brother. -He doesn't have a brother. -Sure he has. Right? -Alex! -I promise. Nothing happened. That's obvious! -Hi. -Hi. -Can we talk? -Yes, sure. Just you and me. No camera. Yes, yes of course... -Come in. -Thanks. I've got some errands anyway. But... I don't get it. You don't have a brother? No. But... why did you want to go with us to Stockholm? I don't get it. Didn't he give you the jacket? I sewed it myself. Sewed it? -But... it's really pretty. Why-- -Don't you get it, Maja? You can't be sewing clothes if you're a guy in a small town like Alingsås. -It means you're gay. -You don't have to be gay to sew. I went to Stockholm to meet someone. I went to meet a guy. We'd been chatting online, but it went to shit... He wrote that he was 21, but he was, like, 35 and had... a beard and... bad breath. So what happened? You didn't do anything, did you? I'm sorry. I didn't know. I thought you were ashamed of me. No... Not everything's about you, Maja. -Does Nathalie know anything? -No! You're the only one who knows. And I don't want anyone else to know. What the fuck...? I'm sorry. I didn't know. I thought you were ashamed of me. No... Not everything's about you, Maja. -Does Nathalie know anything? -No! You're the only one who knows. And I don't want anyone else to know. POSSIBLE TITLE:PHAT CONTRACT PROJECT TITLE:PHAT Hello. Maja, wait! -Wait, at least you can hear me out! -I thought you were my friend! Go to hell! -I just wanted to help you. -Help?! -Stop. Please. -Do you think I'm stupid or something? No, I don't think that. No, I don't! Please, Maja! I'm sorry. I want out. Get it? You'll have to find someone else to take advantage of. Maja... Hey... I get why you're angry. But we're two adults who work together. And even if you feel betrayed and angry, you can't just go. You can't do that. You can't just abandon a project. “Project?” We've talked, and I've told you things I've never told anyone else. Everything we've done, it's all fake. I'm just... I'm just a “project.” No. Do you know why I started on this film? Because I see myself in you. I also feel like an outsider, misunderstood. I also have things inside me that no one understands. We're the same. No... we're not. At least I've learned that you can trust no one but yourself. That's true. But I've struggled. Do you know what my life's like? I'm in so much debt, I go around filming weddings, and get treated like shit. Filming weddings? Oh, the suffering! It's like the children in Africa. Maja, people like you and I get nothing for free. We have to struggle to get somewhere, and now we have this one chance! Maybe it's not exactly what we wanted it to be... but we need this. I don't. My name's Maja Ingmarsson... I don't want to seem stupid... They see me as some kind of joke. But it doesn't matter. Because when your film's finished, everyone will understand the real me. -But there's only a week to go! -You can't drop out now. That's so shitty of you! So, we should cancel the whole thing? I don't know. I'm really sorry. But I can't. Sorry, I just can't. Oh, that's lovely. It looks great on you. It's... I think it's... It's nice, isn't it. It's good that it's not too tight. It is rather unique. Yes, it's definitely one-of-a-kind. It's the last one in the shop. So what will happen with the play? Åsa will cover for me. They'll manage. -Why did you drop out, Maja? -I don't want to be an actress anymore. I dreamt about acting so I could be someone else. But the only parts I get are ugly, unloved failures. And the thing is, I don't need to act to experience that. That's my life. That's bullshit. You know that? Being an actor is not about being someone else. It's about being yourself. Maybe that's why I've never made it. I've never really dared to be myself. But you do. You complain because the character resembles you. Of course it does! That's what it's all about! Use it! Hi. I'm sorry. If you still need me, or want me to play a part, I'd be happy to do it. Excuse me, but I don't think you can come back just like that. -Come on, it's OK... -It's the principle. That's what's wrong with society. Some people don't take responsibility. Oh, please, just shut up! “Visited by the priest.” “Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd in a dark house” Where is Malvolio? He's coming, madam. But in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam. What is the matter? Wilt thou go to bed? To bed! Ay, sweetheart, I'll come! One face, one voice, two persons. How have you made division of yourself? An apple cleft in two's not more twin than these two. Which is Sebastian? WRITING DISC Give me thy hand. And let me see thee in thy woman's cloth. -Is this the madman? -How now, Malvolio. -You have done me wrong. -Have I? Peruse this letter. You must not now deny it is your hand. 'Tis your seal. Tell me. Why have you given me such clear lights of favor? Bade me smile and put on yellow stockings and frown on lighter people. And acting this in an obedient hope... why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd in a dark house... and made the most... the most notorious clown? Tell me why. You were great today. Thanks. You too. -It's like everything's over now. -There's still the graduation. I've got family coming from Serbia. Why do they have to make such a fuss? By the way, I saw your dress. Well, I thought, everyone else will get theirs from places like H&M. It'll be fun to have something different. Something special. It is... very pretty. But I think it could be... even prettier with just a tiny change. Well, it's not like a bunch of mice are going to come and alter it for me. Maybe I could be your little mouse. -Keep still! -But it tickles! I know but... There. Raise your arms. There. What is it now? -Do you know what you're doing? -Yes, of course. -Alex! -Shit! Sorry. Sorry. Wait... Fuck... We can fix it, it'll be fine. We can sew this up and put a flower over it. -A flower? -Or something. Wait, turn round... Shit... A FILM BY ERIKA SOHLMAN They say a wedding is all about love and romance. But is it? Or is it pure narcissism? This is my big day. Little girls, and some boys too, grow up wanting to be princesses. What becomes of all the broken princess dreams? The answer: a wedding. This film is about what happens when your ego grows bigger than your love. -What's the problem? -This is the problem! You wanted a Lord of the Rings theme! I wanted A Clockwork Orange! I wanted a Lord of the Rings theme but not these fucking ears! I look stupid! You'll spoil it if you don't have them. Either you have a theme or you don't! -I don't want the fucking ears! -I look like a fucking hobo here... OK, let's forget it, we'll just cancel the whole thing! “The brightening future is ours,” as the song goes. I hope everyone here feels that this is a day of hope and optimism. -I can't see her. -She's not here. But I also want us to remember that this is the beginning-- that this is the beginning of your adult lives. Sure, you will have a great deal of freedom from today on. But also a great deal of responsibility. Many of you will leave home, and discover what it's like... The two best students always come in last... and wear special clothes. You look lovely! Where did you get it? Alex made it. Alex made it? Hi. -Maja said you made the clothes. -Yes, that's right. They're great. Thanks. -Oscar, over here. Time for a photo. -Okay. -I have to-- -Now! -Cheers, Maja! -Cheers! Wow, Maja... you look like a princess! You too! Oh, yes, I remember Maja Ingmarsson! I was on the panel of the Drama College the year she applied... I'd been sitting there for a few days and seen hundreds of applicants. And so we ask her to begin. But instead, the first thing she does is to point at me and say: “Hey, Rolf Lassgård! My Mom's worked with you!” But when she started to act, it was... Wow. It was 100%, a complete presence. She was a diamond in the rough. I'm really glad she got in. Subtitle translation by Neil Betteridge
