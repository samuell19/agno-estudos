Froggy! What will you do today? Will you jump? What are you going to do? Go on, back in the water. Go! Beat it! Go away! Guys! Guys! There's a retard girl with a dead chicken! You're dreaming. Wake up, dude! - Where? - Right behind the 7/11. Are you nuts? I swear. Go look! Guys, it's true! A dog's attacking the girl! Mylia! Mylia, your sister! Can you come here, please, Mylia? Your sister wrote a note for that boy. Can you go with her, please. I don't want to. It's not far. You know where he lives. Why'd you take it? What? The hen. So you'd heal it. You're good with chickens. Not dead chickens, Camille! I didn't know it was dead. The others were pecking it. Yeah, right. You should've let it die. Camille, look before you cross! Hi. - Here. - What is it? For before. - A card? - Yeah. For the dog? - Thanks. - Welcome. Want to jump? - Camille! - Another time. Will Jimmy be in your class? I have several classes. I'll know this week. I can't wait for high school. Maybe you'll make friends. You should ride a two-wheeler. This is for babies. Hold on. I'll get the milk. Sit down for a sec. What are you doing? Let me fix your hair. OK, but not now. Come on. I'll do a braid, OK? Stop it, Camille! Mylia, you too, please. - She's a pest. - I know. Camille, I said stop! They're all over the floor! Go get the broom, you. You'll clean it, Mylia! That's enough. Stop it right now. We'll talk later. What time's your bus? 10 to. - Stop! - I'm making you pretty! You're being a pain. You're done. Jeez! OK, I've had it! Did you take a bath? No, I'm clean! You haven't had a bath in three days. I'll go to school with Mylia. Sweetheart, you can't. Yes, I can. You'll say bye when the bus comes. - Have you chosen your clothes? - No. Wait up, Mylia! Tell me everything! Go back in the house please. You still wear that? Hi. Is that your locker? Yeah. Nice, we're next to each other. It's by family name, alphabetical. We have the same family name, so... Gabrielle! You jerk! What's up? - Good, you? - Yes. - What do you have now? - History, again, with that crazy bitch. - Who? - My teacher from last year. I flunked. You flunked? She doesn't like me. Maillotte failed too. At least I can chill with him. Yeah. - How was summer? - Just listen! We moved to the fucking boonies. If Mom didn't give me a lift, I'd have a 50-minute bus ride. Christ, I wouldn't go to school. Really! I was freaking out. "Why'd you have to leave Dad? What am I supposed to do, milk cows? The whole town reeks of manure!" Where, exactly? Pierreville. My cousin lives there. I know, we don't look alike. Hi. I'm Jacinthe. Mylia. OK, let's go! You're wired. Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone! I'll try that again. Hello! Hello! That's better! Welcome to high school, for you guys, anyway. As for me, I've been here 34 years. You're lucky to have me while I'm still here. Can you straighten up a little? Thank you. Before we begin, I'd like you to take out your schedules, OK? So, this morning, do you all have the class History and Citizenship Education with Nancy Cournoyer? Yes. Great, then we can start. Madame? Yes? What does History and Citizenship Education mean? It's to educate retards like you. Very good question. It's true, isn't it? What does it mean to be a citizen? What does it involve? I'll help you, it's our first day. A citizen is someone who lives in a country, and who is part of a so-Ci-e... ...Ty. Great. Citizenship Education to introduce you to life in society. Who needs to learn that? "Who needs to learn that?" No, you need to learn. You need this course because no one is born a citizen. You have to become one. Overtime, societies have changed. They've developed. People first grouped together to ensure their survival. Were you waiting for me? No. You were so. And? It was OK. Who's here? Doudou. So, did you find a boyfriend? Get inside. I don't believe it! Jeeze, Louise! What do you mean? What happened to you? Put me down! You're getting all round. A real little woman! Doudou, put on some music! What kind of music? Rock! What kind of rock? Real rock! So? How'd it go? I saw Gab. Her locker's next to mine. Oh yeah? Because of the family name. Mylia! Where's Dad? He's out with a friend. Mylia! You're the woman of my life! - No, I'm too old for that. - Come on - I'm too old. - C'mon, you're so lame! Mom! I'm doing contemporary dance. C'mon! Zoe. Mégan. Arianne. Megan. Noemie. Juliette. Mylia. Michaella. Sorry. What were you doing in there? I stayed to practice. Did you take notes in History? Yeah. So could you maybe help me with our homework? It's random to ask you, but I can't fail again. Mom'd kill me. Sure. Could you come today? Sir, not here. She's getting off with me. Thank you! Mylia! Yeah, I'll eat supper here. Yeah. Could it be 8? Mind if I put on music? That guy in French I told you about, super cute, curly brown hair... You can see him on the Net doing the cow fence challenge. You have to hold the electric fence for, like, three seconds, and not let go. He did it. His friends all pussied out, but he did it. He's really hot, too. He's coming Saturday. I'm having a party Saturday, remember? Girl, you gotta come. Did you forget? Kids from school, everyone we like, our friends. Girl, you gotta come. Want some juice? No, that's OK. I brought you a fork. Thanks. This is so lame. I have zero interest. I'll never use it. I want to be a nurse. I like looking after people. Look, worst case... I've done the first part. So you can take my answers and put it in your own words. Is your mom really a stripper? That's what Gab said, but... - That's chill, it pays we... - No, no no. Not at all. My mom was a dancer, like, contemporary dance. But she's retired. Is she that old? - She retired to have kids. - OK. What a jerk, calling her a stripper! Here are the main activities practiced by early societies. Which of these activities are still practiced? This is so boring! Do the Indians here still hunt? No, I don't think so. Well, same as we hunt. Have you gone to the reserve? Mom doesn't want me to. She says you never know what'll happen. I'm dying to go. To buy some cute moccasins, y'know, for slippers. I could take you. That'd be so cool. I'll nail the Pocahontas look! Think the Indian in our class could get us a deal? But I don't want to ask him. With his floppy hair, you can't see his eyes. Seriously, that was nice of you. No worries. You can come to my party, y'know? It's not an open house, but you can bring friends. Besides, I'm making a punch. Do you have plans? No, that's fine. I'll be there. OK! So, let's say 8 pm? Thank you. Can I sleep in your bed? Are you asleep? Yes. Are you mad? You said you'd teach me to ride on two wheels. I'll show you another time. Did you make a new friend? What's her name? I just helped her with her homework. You should stop sucking your thumb. You'll get buck teeth. That's OK. I'll be ugly but happy. Mom? What? Can I borrow your makeup? A little more. The top now? Don't move. And the other. You don't need makeup. You're beautiful as is. So are you. It's not the same, I'm old. I feel like I'm fading. You're the most beautiful! Pull it up, it's all sagging. Dad liked you even without makeup. Did you use makeup when you danced? Mostly for ballet shows. I hated it. Why? Because they forced us to. I'm sure you were pretty. We all looked the same. Mylia? What? I found you something. In Mom's things? It'll be too big. Hello, birdies! Birds of the earth! No. Why not? You'd be beautiful! Why'd you take it out? Put it all back. At least wear a dress. Then your overalls. It's sort of a dress. - It'd look great with tights. - No. Why not? You always wear them at home. Exactly, at home. I'll check Gaby's things. She has nice clothes. Take that off. You'll get it dirty. I'll try this. - Camille! - What? Take it off! Mom said I could use it. Anyway, it's old. - Mom? - What? Camille ripped your wedding dress. It's OK, I don't need it. And don't yell for nothing, Mylia. I told you! Go roll in a cow pie in your wedding dress! - Mylia? - Go away! - Try this! Go away! Bye, g'night. Hi. Christ, I told you to beat it. Piss off! Come in! Hi. You coming? Here. Thanks. You nervous? She sure looks it. I'm not. Nobody's forcing you. You want her to beat you! Not at all. She could get it all in too. I never said she couldn't. Careful with your teeth. Seriously. The taste isn't that bad. Put on lots of lipstick. So we see your mark. And know if you beat Jacinthe. More, on top too. Don't worry, my mom won't come down. Want some, for good luck? You sure took your time guess you're next. Good luck! Don't stand there staring. Move your fat asses. Does your friend do it? She's not my friend. She's my cousin. And, no. She doesn't know what it is. What? My glass is empty. Yeah? Where am I? Don't worry. As soon as you can stand, we'll take you home. He knows where you live. There's a pail right beside you if you need to use it. I'm sorry. No worries, dear. It's normal. Know what my gran used to say? There are five ways to heal. You can talk, laugh, sweat, cry and scream. Why scream? Not scream just anything. We'd look crazy if we screamed all the time. But sometimes you need to. Hey. Hello. Weren't you going to call me? Why are you on the couch? I was waiting for you. Mom couldn't sleep with your snoring? She'll get over it. And, did you have fun? Were you drinking? No. Have a glass of water before you go to bed. Dad, what if Mom doesn't get over it? No chance of that. Don't worry, sweetie. A glass of water. G'night. G'night. "First Nations Of Canada" You don't work today. No, I need a card. What kind of card? A thank-you. Or an apology, really. An apology? I don't have that kind. A nice card, any one will do. Yeah. This one? Thank you. Happy Birthday! Three... When we talk about humanism, we mean a major transformation in our way of seeing the world. Because before, people thought that the sun circled around the earth. Why? Because people thought the earth was the center of the universe. Of course, from our point of view, when we look up, it seems like it's the sun that moves. Then Copernicus came along. He introduced the idea that the earth rotates around the sun. Just imagine, back then. Total change of perspective. I have to wash. OK, fine. It was a brand new way of seeing things, which is why that period is called the Renaissance. Have a good day! Look at this! What is that? The dude's messed up. Is he a terrorist? - Wanna draw something in it? - Do it! Camille? Want to go for a walk? Where? When Vanessa was mean to you, what did you say to her? - Why do you ask? - I dunno. Yes, you do, Camille. I know what Mom did when she went to see the principal. Right. And what did you do? Nothing. I wish you were still in my school. Hi. Want to practice? Go for it. She wanted to try your trampoline. Is it OK? Yeah, she can come anytime. Mylia! How'd you get the dog off? Is that a family trick? No, I saw it on TV. This Mexican does it. Cesar. If you know how to calm yourself, you can calm the animal. Can you do it on animals besides dogs? Yeah, but it's not that easy. Cats are too stubborn. What about hens? Hens? I never tried. Come to our place. Mine are bonkers. They need calming, all they do is cluck. Oh yeah? Here to see my hens? Yeah. It's ridiculous. I'm sure it'll work. It just needs more patience. It's way easier with dogs. It's all about surprising them. Stop! Not like that, you're hurting it. You're mean! The strongest win. You're not nice to them. You want to hurt them. My hold's wrong. Careful, they're mean! They've just gone crazy. How so? The hen that dog attacked... It had been pecked to death. They ate it? Dad said it's 'cause it was different. The flock eliminates the weak to survive. It's Norma. Being caged makes them crazy. Free-range chickens wouldn't kill like that. But a fox might've eaten it. The strongest win. If you were in the wild, you'd be eaten! - Not the same thing. - Yes, it is! - It's the same! - No, it isn't! It's not. Chickens are stupid! - It's the same! - No, it isn't. Stop! Calm down! Calm down! Let's go try it on wild animals in the woods. Come on. Camille! What? You left your toys on the kitchen floor! Pick them up! I'm busy! Thanks for the card. But it wasn't my birthday. Yeah. Anyway, the picture was pretty. You could've knocked. We won't eat you. The card was for your mom. She's my grandma. What's that? A hideout I made last year with Camille. Is it for hunting? No, to hide in. To hide from what? Nothing. There aren't many animals. No, there are. It's just, we don't see 'em. They hide too, I guess. As a kid, were you the kind who colored over the lines? My parents never bought me those books. We drew on blank paper. OK, and what about at school? I didn't get why there was already a drawing. Finally I realized you were just supposed to color inside it. It seemed pretty. I heard a photographer being interviewed on TV once. He talked about that. Coloring books? No, about a photo he took. He'd gone on assignment, to India, I think. This huge building had collapsed. It was a clothing factory. Remember? No? Families wailed as bodies were pulled out. And all the photographers were snapping pictures. With all the people, the guy couldn't see anything. So you know what he did? He stepped back. And he looked around. He saw four Indian girls in a red convertible, super rich, fucking well dressed, wearing sun glasses, taking shots on their cells. So he took a photo of them. Later he noticed that one of them was wearing the brand of the factory that collapsed. That photo circled the globe. The interviewer asked him why he hadn't tried to push his way through, to take the same picture as everyone. He said that when he was young, he was the kind who would always go over the lines in his coloring book. He said that's where it gets interesting. Like, here. I don't know why she said that. I didn't do anything wrong. I'll call the school. No! Why not? Look what happened to Mylia. What happened to Mylia? - When you went to see the principal. - Yeah, and? Everybody knew. Nobody would talk to Mylia anymore. Her friends all teased her. They said that she shouldn't be there. They said she was no good and then... Vanessa shoved her against the wall and punched her in the gut. They told her she should kill herself. Vanessa told Mylia that? And they said that they'd come and beat up our family. And... Did they tell you that too? Yeah, they did. They said really mean things to me. Chloe told me she'd tell everyone to ignore me. OK, but I still have to report it. But Camille... Don't be scared. We have to talk about it. We have to, so it doesn't happen again. Don't be scared, Camille. OK? - If we'd done that last time... - You'll make it worse. Hello? Hello, Mylia? Yeah, speaking. It's Jacinthe. Are you alright? You sound weird. Yeah, sorry. OK. I was calling to see... You know the school Halloween party? We're dressing up as the Fifth Harmony. We're missing a girl. So I thought of you. Are you interested? I have a costume for you, so it won't be a problem. Like, five girls who sing and stuff... We'll have the best costumes. We'll be, like, the hottest. C'mon, it'll be fun. Mylia* Yeah, the Fifth Harmony, right? You went over. I'll ask you to turn to section 4.5, everybody. Everybody there? The Question of First Nations Mathias, would you read the first paragraph, please? Yeah. In history as in life, humans interpret facts, events and social realities. This reflects who they are, their values, beliefs and interests. Explorers wrote about Indigenous people... What I'd like you to do is, we'll read to ourselves the accounts of the different explorers, their perspectives, and then do the exercise together. Check this! It's totally insane. In silence, please. Read to yourself. It's not rocket science. With your eyes, not your mouths. Yes, Caroline? I don't agree with Mr de Sepulveda. He says First Nations are barbarous and ignorant. It's ridiculous. They're human beings. All human beings are equal. We're all the same. I feel closer to Natives than to French from France with their dumb accent. Jimmy, please. Show some respect. But if you want to join the conversation, just raise your hand. Remember, everybody, give marks for class participation. So, Jimmy? No, that's OK. So is there anyone else who can answer the question? Nathan? Did Indians really engage in depraved orgies? Really, Nathan! It says so! Right, it says so! It's one account among many. One account, it's not widespread. And what we should be asking is: What might have influenced their points of view? Jean-Cedrik, you were laughing. I'm sure you have an answer. I dunno. Do I have to? Yes, you have to. It's easy. You just have to read the text. You can do it. Like Christopher Columbus says... They were naked, had no guns. So they looked less advanced than us. Who's "us"? Well, I dunno. Europeans. I just read what it says. It's all the same. Yeah, for you. Get over it. No, listen... Yes? What are the key words for the test? We have to finish the chapter before I go over that, Carl. And please raise your hand to speak. If weirdo didn't keep interrupting. Fuck you! I'm participating! You'll have to leave if.. I talk? No, if you use foul language, OK? Where were we? Right. Mathias, would you read... the last paragraph, please. Can't someone else have a turn? Yes. Mylia. Fuck that. Mylia... please. Last section. Bartolomé de las Casas was a Spaniard who, after exploiting Indigenous people, became one... one of their best-known defenders. The following excerpt is taken from his memoirs: All these peoples, numberless, universal, varied, God made them simple, without malice or duplicity, obedient and faithful to their natural... to their natural lords and to the Christians, whom they serve. They are the most humble, most... most patient and peaceful, and gentle as any in the world. We'll continue our discussion next time, alright? What's your problem? - Dude... - What's your fucking problem? You're the one flipping out for nothing. For nothing? Christ, why are you in my face? If you don't understand French, sign up for remedial. Right, just walk away, you fag! Mylia, you OK? Yeah. Do you know Vincent? Hey. Hi. Guys are always getting into fights. Remember that fight last year with those two girls? You weren't here, they really went at it. We'd left class, all calm. It was just bad blood. You're sleeping here now? You've decided to quit school to become a full-time trampoline artist? Yeah, I decided to join the circus. travel the world. Lucky. That why you missed the bus? No, I got suspended for the afternoon. What's in your agenda? You mean the photos? Yeah, the photos. Want to see them? Here. Newspaper smudges your fingers. Why not use magazine photos? I dunno. It's my collection. You collect newspapers? No, newspaper photos. Just the ones I like. Since when? It started with my mom. They printed her picture. I decided to cut it out and tape it on my wall. She looked sorta lost all alone there. So I started cutting out others. Her being dead didn't seem so sad, because she's with others. It smudges, but it looks good. Jacinthe invited me to the Halloween party. Were you gonna go? Why wouldn't I go? I'll come to save you. I don't need to be saved. Tomorrow's Camille's birthday. So you won't be with her? No. Sucks for her. What'll she do? I'm not sure. What's happy birthday in your language? I could sing Happy Birthday in Abenaki. I dunno. Or something else that I could say to make her feel special. I don't know. I'll wish her happy birthday for you. OK. What're you going as? The Fifth Harmony. Costumes reveal our true nature. Shut up! What are you going as? An Indian. What? - You're so dumb. - I swear. You should dress up as a hunter, not as a slut. I saw your hideout in the woods. I'm not dressing up as a slut. Same thing. Girls who use Halloween as an excuse to show skin, dressing like sluts to get attention, it's classic. Is your Walmart Indian costume better? Meaning what? You think you're cool in your shitty costume but you can't speak your fucking language. You think you'll always be just fine, that you don't need anyone. But nobody gives a shit about you. It's not your choice. Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you too. Don't you have your costume? Why not? Did you know... Mom says there are panthers here. But they're called lynxes. - They're up north, in the forest. - Camille... What? I can't be here tonight. What? There's a party at school and Jacinthe invited me. They're going as the band Fifth Harmony and they were one short. It's, like, the big party of the year... At school. You'll have fun with Mom and Dad. Here. Since I won't be here... It's a bit big. You'll grow. Thanks. You can invite friends from school here tonight. Right, Camille? I don't have friends from school. I don't need more, I have a real friend already. Cam? What? You know, kids.. They're jealous of you. So they tease you. You know? Yeah, I know. She's just dumb. That's so ugly! But your bra. You need one that's more, like. Stop, I hate that! - It was time. - What was? She's what, 15, 16? At that age. She says she did it with Guillaume. But.. Why don't you believe her? She's screwed everyone. To get a guy who's mature, you need to be experienced. They don't want virgins. Not necessarily. There's no right age. I did it before 16. So for me, 16's old. But who cares if you do it before or after 16. Not my business. If you menstruate, it's time. So if you bleed from your vagina, you can fuck? Need a condom? Is it your week? Why are you ganging up on me? Where's Gab? Her mom vetoed the costume. She'll meet us there. Really? That's pretty, Mylia. Really hot! Vincent will want to french with you for sure. He's crazy about you. You scored the guy! Make your move! What, make my move? Anyway, I think it's a perfect age. Get real. I love your hair. Do you get it streaked? Anyway, with Vincent, don't fuck up! Some guys are babies and immature. Show him who's boss. Get him in a corner and, like they say, just do it! I wish I were in your shoes. Fuck, I can't put on mascara! I always get it all over. Here, I can show you. Did your mom give you that? Yeah, so I wouldn't look too sexy. You sure aren't sexy like that. Your boots pass, but... You put on nylons but we don't see 'em. 'Cause I'm a vampire. Your mom's idea? So I'm not too sexy. You bring your clothes in a bag and change in the washroom. I didn't think of it. At least your shoes are OK. You see that? Didn't you know? Know what? Game on! What do you mean? Like, they're hooking up. My cousin? Wanna go somewhere else? What do you want? I dunno. Is that OK? Not like that. How? I dunno. Go away. What did I do? Please go away. Wanna come in for a bit? Camille. Wanna come play with me? And do what? Learn to ride on two wheels. Wait, wait! Why'd you wake me up? 'Cause it'll be fun. No more trainers. Ready? C'mon! Ready? 1, 2, 3, go! Mylia, you're crazy! 1, 2, 3, go! Keep your feet on the pedals. No, I can't! I'm riding on two wheels! Mylia! Mylia! Don't take your hands off! I almost fell doing that, like you said. Like, to keep from falling. So, feet on the pedals... Go as far as you can. 1, 2... Is it straight? 1, 2, 3, go! Not too fast, OK? Jimmy's as slow as a turtle. What? You're slow as a turtle. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! Last one there's a rotten egg! Here we come! My legs hurt! We're winning! I'm gonna catch you! Girls, come have supper. Can Jimmy eat with us? No, another time, OK? Why not? Come on. I forgot my helmet. We're in trouble. Let's go. Can I go out? No, come sit down, please. We need to talk. Camille, head off the table, please. I forgot my helmet, but I'll get it. That's fine. It's not... It's not because of you. What is it then? What? I knew it. You're splitting up? It's not easy, Mylia. We don't mind your fighting, really. Right, Mylia? It has nothing to do with you. Please don't think that. You don't love each other anymore? It's not that simple. Then why? I found us a place in town. Right next to Grandma and Grandpa's. We're moving? But... Why do we have to leave? Why can't we stay with Dad? No. No, it wouldn't work, Mylia. With Dad's schedule, you know... You'll come with me. What if we want to stay here? We talked about it and.. we decided that's what's best. This is our home! Camille... Yes, here! I know. Mylia! Mylia! Go away! Go away! Go away! Calm down. Calm down. I'm not a fucking dog! I'm not a fucking dog. You need to talk. I think I love you. Dear Jimmy, Today I bought a card to send to you. Camille! You're the woman of my life! I had my first class here. A geography class. The teacher told us all Europe met once to divvy up Africa. They cut it into pieces like a cake. The teacher asked us to the draw the colonies on map. My colors spilled over, into the ocean. At recess I read what Europeans did in Africa. They chased the Blacks from their lands to get their resources. The Europeans got too rich and fought each other. It reminded me of your photographs. You should see my classmates. There are some from Africa, Spain, France, Greece. But nobody like you. They asked me where I'm from. From the forest, I said. My best friend's an Abenaki warrior. Nobody believed me. One kid said I was weird. If I become just like everyone else, please, kill me.
