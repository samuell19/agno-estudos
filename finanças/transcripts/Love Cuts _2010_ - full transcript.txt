I like to look pretty. That's why I love beautiful clothes. Beautiful clothes can lift one's spirits. And so, I kept searching, for that one outfit that would make me look perfect. Until I met a seamstress who told me that all of us already own the most precious outfit of all, which is our own body. Love Cuts Five more minutes... I have been up for a while. You gave me the lunchbox with bread crust on the last time! It's the wrong box! Mum, I want fried noodles tomorrow. -Bye! -Bye-bye! Hey, hey. Mum, Mun was working late last night, that's why he couldn't answer his phone. There's a banquet on Sunday, so he has to work overtime. I'll get him to call you in Hong Kong when he's up. Okay then, bye! Wait for me! Why don't you eat the breakfast Mum makes? Only little kids would eat the breakfast made by their mums. I'll tell Mum. You do that and I'll tell her you gave her breakfast to your boyfriend. I did not! Stop saying that... Okay, good! Bring the lights over a little. Okay, it's very simple, I'll need you to... I think her makeup needs to be touched up. Extra strong coffee! Good morning, Sissy! I feel refreshed when I see you. Here you go, your daughter's shoes, shiny and good as new! She's really careless. These are new shoes and she's already scratched them. -How much do I owe you? -It's okay! No, no, take it back! -No, I can't... -It's okay, really. -No, you have to take it. -Just buy me a few more cups of coffee. -Take it! -No, no. -How can I? -It's really okay! Keep it! -Thank you then! -Okay. -Bye! -Bye. Feathers! Look here, good! Tuesday! Chee cheong fun, with extra chili and sesame. -Bye! -Hey, wait! Take your time, no hurry. -Don't forget to take the money from me! -Of course! You won't run away. -I'll look you up in your shop! -Okay. I just need you to smile a little bit more. Relax, okay? Okay, good. Slightly apart. Perfect! Auntie, do you do alterations for branded clothes? Branded, authentic and even imitations, I work on all kinds of clothes! Come, let me have a look. For graduation or prom? Or for work? Neither, but I need it urgently. Sure, put it on. Button up. I'll alter this part. The wait is too long in the other store. They need two to three weeks to alter these. They said come to you if I need it quickly. Auntie, were you their tailor? "Seamstress". It's "seamstress". Don't call me "Auntie". Just call me Si Si or Sissy. Now, put your hand up. How is it? -Okay. -Put it down. You collect it next week, okay? That's quick! You're going to do a good job right? These are very expensive! Young man, I've been in business for almost 30 years, don't worry. If I don't do a good job, you don't pay. Write down your name and contact number. Then can I have it ready the day after tomorrow? I'll call you. Why aren't you having coffee and reading the paper first? Starting work so early? I have a lot of rush orders. Your business is always bustling! Wow! What a beautiful little outfit! This must be for some rich Indonesian Tai Tai's daughter again. This one's for my daughter. Mabel is turning 10 in two days' time! She says she wants a perfect little Princess outfit. You're spoiling your daughter by giving her whatever she wants. What's the point of working so hard? We don't even get to keep the tips. It all goes to the boss! And we're never gonna get a raise! They even cut our salaries if we break something or if we're late. This is a cruel business! Hurry up and get back to work or you'll really get it! The customers won't wait for us! Brother Mun, when you turn into a different person and start your own restaurant, I'll be sure to join you! Why must he turn into a different person? One has to be inhumane to be a boss! Brother Mun is always good to the customers and good to us! Yeah! Enough with the flattery, I can't give you a raise. You have to prove yourselves to the boss. You just need to get his approval! Go! Go! Go! We'll listen to you, Brother Mun! Go on! Sissy, are my two evening gowns ready? Yes, they're ready. I'll get it! Thanks! "Louie"? Are you gonna wear these? It's "Louis"! Such bad English! Are you crazy? They're low-cut and bareback. Wow! Hey, it looks expensive! You won't believe how much they cost. It's more than a month of your salary! Louis! I've fixed the tear and also fixed some loose sequins. Sissy, you're the best! It looks brand new! Oh, I have another outfit here. It's a superstar's, she's attending an event tomorrow. Can you loosen an inch at the waist? I'll collect it this evening. Louis, I really can't do it today... Please help me! I'll be in trouble if this superstar gets upset! Which superstar? Is she very famous? You won't believe it if I tell you! She doesn't want people to know she's in Singapore! Louis, I really can't do it today. I've got to... I'll pay you double! It's a simple job, just loosen an inch. Please, please help! Thank you! Thank you! Okay, okay, leave it. Okay, you're the best! -I'll come by this evening. -Okay. -Okay? -Okay, bye-bye! Wow! This is so beautiful! Gorgeous! I've never worn something like this ever! I can make you one of these. Really? Those outfits you designed, they've been hanging there for years and no one has bought them. Such exquisite tailoring, so beautiful. If only I was younger, I'd definitely buy them for myself. It's rare that someone appreciates them. Which one do you like? It's my gift to you! I'm just joking! How can I carry it off? A woman can be beautiful at any time. She can dress up for herself. You don't have to do it to please anyone, do it just to make yourself happy. You have a doting husband and your two children are so well-behaved. You have such a blissful life! Love makes one radiant! Okay, I won't bother you anymore. I'm off. Bye! Although he died young, listeners' impression of him will always be that of a talented and distinguished musician. When Tom Chang released his debut album in 1988, he said that the album was in memory of his sister, and also dedicated to everyone who loves life. Presenting the new cover version of "Thinking of you Everyday". May you live each day with happiness and shine for yourself and for others. Hey, welcome! Come on in! You're all grown up! Take a seat first. Excuse me! Water please! Have a drink! Coming! Please have a seat. Please come in. Is the seat in front okay? Here, let mum do it. Wow, just look at my pretty little princess! Go on. -Hello! -Hello! Thank you! Howard, come over! Can you call Dad to ask if he's on his way here? There's no need to, he'll get here. We'll start once Dad's here. Please have some tea. Can't decide? You had set meal A last week, and set meal B may be too much for you, how about set meal C? Set meal C comes with two cold dishes, fish, beef, vegetables and fried rice. Is that enough? I don't eat beef. Then I'll have it changed to boiled pork, it's a little spicy. Is that okay? Sure! Okay. Set dinner comes with free dessert. It's Chinese herbal jelly today. I don't eat Chinese herbal jelly. In that case, a complimentary Hashima just for you, okay? -Great. -It won't be long. Hey wait, could you get us some chrysanthemum tea? No problem! -Okay, thanks! -Give me a minute! Hey, get the bill for table 11. Get some chrysanthemum tea, thanks! Hey, hey! Is this how you run my business? No wonder the restaurant is not making money! What is it, boss? It's you! It used to be complimentary Chinese herbal jelly, and now it's Hashima. How do you expect the restaurant to make money? Wasn't business thriving last month? If this continues, I wouldn't dare to have you transferred to the main branch. The shop space there is double the size, and triple the rental here! Do you have any idea how high the cost of business is? You should be recommending expensive dishes to the customers instead of set meals. How else do you expect us to make money? Okay, okay, I get it. Do you? I doubt it! Where are you? We're about to start. Can you hurry? We're taking pictures soon. Okay! Happy birthday to you! Make a wish! This is for you! Wow! Thank you, Mum! Look! Come, all together now. One more! One more! -You take one! -Okay! Howard! Hurry, come take a picture together. Come, all together now. Okay, together! Smile! Mabel! Why haven't you changed? Mum, look! What is it? I want it to be stitched here next time, like a grown-up's, just like yours. You're still young. Hurry and get changed before you dirty them. No, I want Dad to see me in this! Your dad didn't even call, I don't know when he'll be back. I'll wait. Dad! Dad! Dad! Is my outfit pretty? Of course it is. Who made it? Mum made it specially for me. I told her I wanted a dress, like they wear on American TV shows and she made this. Did you have fun at the party? Are you happy? It was fun. We kept a slice of cake for you, it's on the table. I got lots of presents, do you want to see them? Auntie Mary said my birthday cake is pretty and delicious! Jonathan was very naughty. He unwrapped one of my presents. Even after I said I wanted to do it myself. He said I was too slow. You didn't even call. We were all waiting. You could have informed me even if you were busy. Mabel, go take a shower, and change out of your clothes! Go on, quick. We took a lot of photos. The camera's on the table, take a look. The battery's dead, how do I see the photos? Change the battery so I can see the photos. Hey! You must knock before you enter! I did, but you didn't hear it. What are you busy with? Homework. Why is your room in such a mess? Why were you not at Mabel's birthday party? Where's the charger for the camera? I don't have it. These things are always in your room. Look for it yourself! How can I when your room is in such a mess? How are you going to sit for National Service exam in two years' time? It's my room that's messy, not yours! What's this nonsense about yours or mine, is there a need to differentiate? Get one thing straight, I'm your Dad, and I can enter any room I like. Now go look for the charger! If you want it, look for it yourself. You useless brat. Whenever I ask you to do something, you don't want to... Okay, okay, go take a shower, go. You should talk to him when you have the time! Look at his room, it's like a war zone. Okay, I will. What were you arguing about? He started it! Try to keep your room clean. You don't even want to let me in. Okay! Okay! I'll do it when I'm free, okay? Close the door! Good! Nice one. A few more... Over here. Arch, arch... And we're good. Take a break, help to touch up her makeup. Good. Shift the light a bit more to the left. I heard you'll be endorsing a high-end New York lingerie brand, and become their Asian spokesmodel. Congratulations! Okay, okay, we're ready! Okay, let's start. Construction work is very dangerous, you know! Thank you, Sissy. Next time, I'll bring my special Indian curry for you. Next time you build one nice condo for me, okay? Okay! Hey! Wait! Wait! Your money! You gave me discount, five dollars right? Who says, three dollars! You build nice houses for us, I give you more discount. Thank you, Sissy! -See you, bye-bye! -Bye! Do you do alterations? Feel free to look around. Auntie, I want this, this, this, this and that. Are you buying all of them? I'm trying them on. You want to try them all? I want to try them all! If you like them after you try them on, will you buy them? If I like them, I'll buy them. Take all these down for me! Miss... Are you okay? What happened? My heart is broken. I'll bring them for you. Take your time. Miss, you can take your time. I don't close so early. If you want my opinion, come out and let me have a look. Hey, food delivery! Where's Howard and Mabel? Why are they so late today? Yeah, I'm about to text them. All these are Mabel's favorite dishes. Wow, how beautiful! I want this piece. Sure. Who's that? She's pretty, just like a model! But, why is she so sulky? She acts like she doesn't like the outfit, yet she wants to buy it. She's heartbroken and feeling sad. Women always feel better when they shop, so I told her to take her time trying on the clothes. You're so soft-hearted. Enjoy your dinner. Thanks. Miss, let me know which piece you like. It's okay if you don't like them, just try them. Let's see. Wow, the sleeve is too wide, I'll tighten this part. You have a great figure, and you look gorgeous in this. You're not saying this just because you want me to buy it, right? Well, I do really like these few pieces. The designs are different and they are well-made too. What brand are these? I don't see any labels. Branded, authentic or even imitations, just buy them if you like them! I'll make some alterations, and they'll look like they're tailor-made for you. Come. Miss... Don't mind me saying this, you're so pretty. You'll have no shortage of men. He broke up with you, it's his loss. You'll definitely find your true love, the one who will love you back. I want them all. Actually, women can be independent too. Do you know... Auntie... You can call me... Auntie, I'm here to buy this stuff, not to hear you preach! You do alterations too, right? Please alter these and I'll collect them in two days. Leave your name and contact number. How much deposit should I pay? No need. No one will want to buy these outfits. I'll reserve them for you. Kristie... Promise me you won't do anything stupid. The people who care for you will be sad if you do. Feel free to drop by my shop anytime. I have a lot of free time, so if you need someone to talk to, come any time. Okay? Mummy! I'm starving! Hurry... I'll be wearing that in two days. Please have them ready soon. Remember, don't do anything stupid! Come to me if you need anything, okay? -Mum... -Don't forget! I'm starving! Hurry! Alright, coming! Why do you call yourself Auntie? Once upon a time, there was a place called the One-Armed Kingdom. Do you know why it is called the One-Armed Kingdom? Yes, because everyone who lives there has only one arm, one leg, one eye, one nostril, only one of everything... Only one of everything, isn't that sad? So are they monsters? We may feel sorry for them, but to them, it's people like us who have two arms, two legs, two eyes, two nostrils who are the real monsters! -So you're a monster! -You are the monster! -Both of us! -We are all monsters! It's almost 2 a.m., why aren't you sleeping? Don't let our daughter sleep so late, she has school tomorrow. You said you want to bring your mum along for the trip? Give me her details, and the kids' passport numbers too. What are the numbers? E... 4556... Tell me the whole number! 4556700A. Mabel's? E2345770D. It's not that I want to nag, but you shouldn't be cooping yourself in that little shop! Talk to the children when you have time. I'm busy working, but I've no idea what you're busy with! I've to stand for 10 hours every day. Since you have so many problems, why don't you just go back to Hong Kong? -Hi, beauties! -Hi, Timothy! -Busy? -Not really -Where's Kristie? -She's upstairs. -Okay, I'll go look for her. -Okay! -Bye! -Bye-bye. Wow, he's so handsome! Okay! Let's break for lunch! Have the next outfit ready Hey, it's lunchtime! Wow, what a gorgeous bride! Yes, she's really pretty! Timothy! Your rich boyfriend's here to see you! It's nice of you to visit me at work. I'm here to propose. Weren't you golfing in New Zealand? You're angry? I came the minute I landed. My golf bag is still in the car. Kristie! Are you coming with us? Come, I'll buy everyone lunch! You guys go ahead, I'm not eating. I'll stay behind to rest. Then we'll take a rain-check on your offer, Timothy! Sure, you guys go ahead. Do you want us to bring you some food? It's okay, you guys go ahead! Okay, see you! I heard you'll be the first Asian spokesmodel for a high-end New York lingerie brand! How did you hear? The contract's not even signed! I don't even know if they really want me. Why would anyone not want you? To me, you're the most beautiful. I want you to always be beautiful and stunning. Even after a meal, after marriage, or after we have kids! Who said anything about having kids? Me! It's nothing serious, probably exhaustion from working too hard. I suggest that you get a check-up done. Everything seems fine, the ECG also appears normal. Do you feel unwell or have any pain? When did you find out? It could be due to hormonal changes. Why don't you come back in two weeks' time, and we'll have another look. Are you serious? Of course! I want to announce to the whole world that I, Timothy Tang love Kristie Kong the most! No one can hear you here! I want you to prove it to me. I can't say for sure, the last time you had a mammogram was three years ago. Why don't I refer you to a specialist for consultation? Let me assure you. I'll get a professional to take artistic nude shots of us, to capture the most beautiful photos of us. Everyone will then say we're a match made in heaven, so perfect, so compatible. What do you think? What if you're just toying with me? I can't tell what exactly it is right now. It's best to do a biopsy. Kristie, if you trust me, please say yes. It is is something that will belong only to us, it will be the most beautiful image. Okay. Okay. Would I need full anesthesia? Yes, general anesthesia. The tumor is very deep. Okay. General anesthesia. Mum... Where were you? The food has become cold. I told them to eat first... When did you get here? I've been here for a while. I was shopping in the area, so I dropped by, but you were not in. How can you leave your business unattended? No one's looking after the kids either! I had something to do. They usually eat on their own. You must watch what they eat, outside food is not good. See, they're not eating well. What is it? No appetite? Come over to Grandma's place soon, I'll cook all your favorite dishes. Mabel, what's your favorite? Forget it. Don't eat the food if you don't like it. Go and wash your hands, don't touch those fabrics! Okay. Mum... Why is it so messy everywhere? You don't seem to be handling either your family or the shop well. How's Wai Mun? Has he got a promotion yet? Mum... Have you taught Mabel anything? What if she doesn't even learn to sew on a button? And Howard's always playing on his phone. He's so quiet and reserved, he'll have trouble getting a girlfriend! Why don't you cook more of his favorite dishes? Growing boys need to eat more! Mum... You've washed up? It's time to do your homework, Grandma will take you home. Be good, say bye to Mum before you leave. -I'm off. -Bye, Mum! I'll take them home now. Hey, why do you look so tired? Have you had dinner? You don't look very well. It's late, no more customers will come, just close for the day! We'll leave now. Hey... When Mum calls later, have a longer chat with her, don't hang up so quickly. Oh, Raymond called. He's starting a restaurant and wants me as a partner. He's found a shop space too. Your brother wants you as his business partner? Yes. Wouldn't that require a lot of money? That's why we need to go into a partnership! About 100,000 Singapore dollars. He says Shenzhen is really bustling now, and the exchange rate for CNY is good. It's the ideal time to go back as opportunities are plenty. Move back? What about the kids? Of course I'd like us to move back together, but it's impossible. It's best for the kids to continue schooling here, there's no better education system than in Singapore. I'm almost 50, and it's time to be my own boss now. Being your own boss, doesn't mean you don't have to put up with people. It's different! Why don't you invest in the business, and we'll run it together! I don't have the money. Isn't your shop worth some money? The shop belongs to my mum. Why don't you get your mum to sell the shop? Even if you want to keep the business, there's no need for so much space. The property market is booming now. She can sell it for a tidy profit, invest in the restaurant and be the boss. Isn't that great? Give us five years, after five years, we'll become a franchise, and then we can retire! I'm not so blessed. You don't seem to want the best for me, or for me to make it big! I'm not meant for such a life. I don't know what you're thinking. I've been in Singapore for 20 years, I haven't achieved anything! Do you remember my friend, Fatty Rong? He returned to Hong Kong some 10 years back and he's now the owner of several restaurants! If I'd followed in his footsteps, I would have been a boss by now! Don't just coop yourself up in the shop, please go out more and you'll see it's a different world now. People shop at malls now, they buy designer labels, throw clothes away when they're worn out and old. Sewing? Can you really mend what's torn? I have breast cancer. What? Fourth stage breast cancer. The doctor says I should start chemotherapy, in two weeks. Hi. -Here to pick up your clothes? -Yes. They're all ready, give me a minute. The last time you said... I could come and talk to you any time. Yes. Actually, I was not heartbroken. Oh, that's good. I was worried you'd do something silly. Did you design all these yourself? They're beautiful! It's no big deal. My husband always says they're just good for display, but you really do look gorgeous in them. I wanted to wear them to an event, but... I may not be able to now. It's okay if you don't like them. No one wants to buy them anyway... Oh, it's not that! That's not what I meant! What I wanted to say was... My mum had it... So does my sister... All of them... It runs in my family, but I can't! It wasn't easy for me to clinch the... And I want to get married! So I can't... I cannot be! Take a seat first. Here. Thanks. When did you find out? Have you seen a doctor? They have done a biopsy, and sent it for tests. There will be a way out. When will you know the outcome? The doctor said it would take two weeks, that's in two days' time. Two weeks... I can't tell my colleagues and... I'm afraid my boyfriend will... I don't know! I just thought... Perhaps I could talk to you. I don't know why... Maybe you would understand. I'm sorry to bother you, Auntie. I've been wanting to tell you, My name is Sissy or can call me Si Si. Thank you, Sissy. No, thank you, Kristie. Day after, is someone going with you to the doctor? My family's not here. I'll go with you. Come on. This is your mammogram. It's a tumor, a malignant tumor. Does anyone in your family have a similar medical history? My concern is that it could spread and move to other parts of your body, so it must be removed, the sooner the better. What if I don't remove it? Is there any way, that I can survive without removing it? It's hard to say... I'm sorry! Kristie... Kristie! Come back, we have to make an appointment for your operation. If you don't remove it, what if the cancer cells spread? Remove it while you still have the option to! Timing is crucial, don't wait till it's too late! Kristie, the breast is mostly made up of fat, just think of it as removing some fat. Why would that happen? There's more to life than having perfect breasts! Sissy, without my breasts, I'd be out of work. And my boyfriend won't want me anymore! Don't be stupid! Your life is more important! Don't indulge in vanity! Do you know how foolish you are? You're letting all your loved ones down, you know that? Kristie! Mum... Here, I made some chicken soup. Warm it up for the kids later. This one, I brewed for a long time. I specially went to the Chinese medicine shop, and they told me it's good for nourishing the body, it's good for you... Drink it while it's hot, don't leave it for too long, it won't be nutritious if it turns cold. Don't worry... How can I not worry? I don't even have it, so why do you? Hello? Is this Kristie? Yes, it's me. Are you busy? I called you several times from my mobile phone, but you... Oh! Okay. I'll be quick then. Are you free this weekend? My family's celebrating Father's Day this weekend, I'll be cooking, and would like to invite you to join us. Kristie... The other day, I really shouldn't have... Oh, yes. It's 6:30 p.m., this Sunday. You'll check your schedule? Okay, that's great! Okay, see you then. You must come! Okay, bye! -Kristie! -Hi! Kristie! Look, is my doll pretty? It's really cute! Your shades are pretty! -Am I pretty? -Very pretty! -Your turn now. -Okay! -Well? Do I look pretty? -Yes! Howard... Come and give me a hand. Dinner's ready. Mum's cooking is really good! -Let's go and help. -Okay! -Take those out. -Okay. -Hello! Let me help. -It's okay. -Just wait outside, go, go! -It's okay. Their dad may be back late today. It's Father's Day, so he took a rare half-day off from work. We can cut the cake right after dinner. Wow! A cake for Father's Day? Because I want to eat it! Your service is really bad! It wasn't like this in the past! It shouldn't be like this even if your business is bustling, right? Right, I'm sorry, we're rather short-handed lately. Is that really the problem? You can hire more staff if you're short-handed! I think the problem lies in the way you train your staff. You're not doing your job as a manager! Let me tell you, if it was someone else, they'd already have posted a video of this on YouTube! Or they'd have filed a complaint. Okay, please don't be angry. I'll treat everyone to some Hashima. Get me the bill! Sure. Here, I'm truly sorry. This time, I've given you a 50% discount, and here are some vouchers which you can use next time. Next time, we'll see about that. -Let's go! -Thank you! Please come again! Thank you. Bye, bye Thank you. Kristie, you're really pretty just like my doll! Who taught you that? Good girl! What do you want to be when you grow up? I used to want to be a seamstress. But now I want to be a model! It's no good being a model. Aren't you a model? Why is it not good being a model? A model can... -Daddy! -Hi, baby. Hi! You're back! This is Kristie, the friend I told you about. -Hello, how do you do? -Hello. -Please sit. -Thanks. Sit! Leave it, please. It's okay, you sit and relax! Sorry to trouble you. You go ahead and chat! -How was the food? -It was very good! You're not only good at tailoring, but cooking as well! Not at all! Wai Mun cooks much better than I do. Dad hasn't cooked for us in a while! I hear you're the manager of a big restaurant. You must be very busy, and hardly get to take time off work, right? Dad will be on leave soon! We're going on a cruise! Just for a few days, over the weekend. We were planning to go with my mum, but she's been unwell lately, so she's not going. Mabel and Howard must be really excited! I don't think it's much fun going on a cruise. Staying on the ship the whole time. I'm not going. The whole family has to go. Get Kristie to come along! Take Grandma's ticket! That's right. I don't know if I have the time to... Check your schedule. We have an extra ticket anyway. Just join us and have a break. Right, Wai Mun? Sure. Do let us know if you can come. Kristie, please come? Okay, I'll check! Good! Let's cut the cake! -Happy Father's Day! -Happy Father's Day! -Kristie, are you excited? -What's taking so long? -Are you tired? -Happy? Happy! The weather is nice today. Take a picture of Mum and me! Okay. One, two, three! -Kristie, you take one too! -Sure! Give me the umbrella. One, two, three! -Okay! -Thanks! Let me. -It's okay. -Okay. -I want to eat. -You're a glutton! Excuse me, Miss. Your set meals A, B, and C, do they all have seafood? -Yes, it comes like that. -Can I choose something else? We're on a ship out at sea, so you eat seafood, that's our special menu. Then... Hey! What's wrong with her? I'm not done. What kind of service is this! Let's go somewhere else. Dad, I'd like to have prawns. Mum's not well... It's okay, let them eat. Okay, you pick something then. Kristie? Is this fine with you? It's fine. I'll eat with them. So which one would you like, prawns? You decide. -This one? -Yes. Would you like... Come, let's go to the other table. Here, come over here. Honey, you sit here. -Hi! -Oh, hi! Where are the kids? Oh, Wai Mun is taking them around so I can have some quiet time. -Then I won't disturb you. -Oh, no! You can keep me company. Okay. Your kids are very cute. I'm worried about Mabel, she's too dependent. And Howard keeps everything to himself. I guess I haven't taught them well. Why do you say that? Your husband really dotes on you. Thank you for asking me to come along, so that I can be away from it all for a while. Your boyfriend? He wants me to take nude pictures with him, but he has not proposed to me formally. So what does that mean? I don't know. Do you love him? I don't know... Is this what's stopping you from getting the operation done? Maybe... If you were in my shoes, what would you do? If I remove them I'll lose my endorsement, and Timothy will not love me anymore. I'll have nothing left... Would it still be a life worth living then? As long as you're alive you can always get another job. As long as you're alive you can always get another boyfriend. You're still young, you can still have a full life. Just like you? Are you happy? If you were to choose, what would you do? I have no answer to your question. What I do know is when one is sick, it becomes more than just about that person. The individual's family and friends need solace as well. Because they would be at a loss over what to do... What to say... Or how to help... So that person has to be strong for everyone else. Because we know ourselves best, and only we can help ourselves. You asked if I'm happy? I tailor and mend clothes for people everyday, yet I've never made an outfit for myself. I think about the people whose clothes are worn or torn, when I mend them and they become like new again, how happy they'd be. That's what makes me happy. I've mended clothes all my life, and I've come to realize that each one of us has a special outfit that no tailor can make. And that is our own body. As for your heart, and your body, I can't mend them. You have to do that on your own. Hey! No, no! You have to separate the white clothing from the colored ones. -So which ones do I start with? -The white ones, of course! Okay. Will you be able to do it? -How much of this? -Two scoops. -I've preset this for you. -Okay. You just have to press this button. Try it. Just live your life as you normally do and go about your usual activities. Exercise regularly, watch your diet, and keep a healthy lifestyle. What is your line of work? I'm a seamstress. Isn't that the same kind of work as a surgeon? Bring this back. You have school holidays next week. Go and help out at Mum's shop when you're free, okay? Why do we have to come here for dinner nowadays? Why can't we just eat at the shop like we used to? I don't like it here That uncle keeps staring at us. You'll have to be good from now on. Don't make Mum angry, and spend more time with her. Do you understand? Over here are magazines and some samples. And these are for the collection, bring the clothes out and hang them here. The customers' names and contact numbers are written here, don't mix them up. And this, this is very important. These are for the display, so they must be kept neat and tidy. Understand? Howard, did you bring your camera? Yes. Take a picture for me. I want Dad to see me while I'm still pretty. Stand there. Okay. One, two, three. Done. I need you to go to the suppliers later and bring this back for me. This is the sample. Over here are the samples from our customers. And these are the suppliers samples. All the fabrics and colors are here. Zippers are here. All the different styles and colors and these too. See? And, this is very important. All our customers' information, they're all written in here. Their contact numbers, addresses, and names. Okay? Yes. Okay, now go get the thread for me. Okay. Where is it? Don't forget! Do you have this type of thread? We've run out of stock. Do you want to wait? Wait? I'll ask someone to get it from the warehouse. How long would I have to wait? Three hours. Three hours? Do you have other types? Yes! Of course! Here, this one. It's different, it's cheaper. Then I'll take this. Hey, are you sure this is what your mum wants? Of course. Isn't it better that it's cheaper? Take my advice, just wait for three hours. I'll ask someone to get it from the warehouse. No, don't bother, I'll just take this. Fine, if that's what you want. Are you sure you're Sissy Chang's son? -This is what he gave you? -Yes. He must have made a mistake. I'll call him to check. He said they ran out of stock and I had to wait for three hours to get it. He said this is similar, and it's also cheaper. This is what you brought back. And this... ...is what you should have brought back. Do you see? If by waiting for three hours you could get thread that lasts 30 years, then why not wait? You must want to do the best in whatever you do, and not just settle for second best. Otherwise, you are not only deceiving the customers, but yourself as well. Hey, what are you doing? I want to make myself some porridge. Let me do it. You sit down. I can do it. By the way, I got a call at the shop, it was from a property firm. They say the market is really good now. Why don't we sell the shop now? Then you'll have more time to rest. The shop is turning 30 soon. How many things in life can last this long? How can I give it up now? I'm not asking you to give it up totally, but to take a short break. Didn't the doctor say... Didn't the doctor say to live my life normally? If I close the shop, how will I do that? As long as I can still move, I will not close down the shop. Okay, okay. Don't get angry! Continue working if that's what you want. I'll get you some chicken stock. If I die, then the shop can be closed. Hey! Touchwood! Don't say such things. Don't say that. Okay, then let me make myself clear. Put your mind at ease. You can remarry. I won't mind at all. You're crazy! Why are we talking about this! Look at me Do you know, in all these years that I've been in Singapore, my greatest happiness is to have you as my wife! And now you're asking me to find another woman who can dote on our kids, and put up with a man like me. It's just not possible! I can't find anyone like you! Mum, help me fix this. Mum will teach you how to sew, okay? No, I don't know how to do it, you're better at it! Come on, you will know how to do it once you learn. It's easy, I will teach you. When Mum is not around next time you can do it yourself. Mabel, once you've learned sewing, I will make you a nice new dress, okay? Can you make me a kimono? Okay. I'll make the most beautiful one for you. See, it's very easy. Hey, Howard you're here all alone? -Where's your mum? -She's out I haven't seen much of her lately. Howard, please pass on a message to your mum. I didn't see her the last few times, so I forgot to collect the payment from her! Oh, okay. Just pay me next time, okay? No hurry, no hurry at all. Okay, thanks. She forgot to take her phone. You must rest first. Mum! Mabel! Come. Don't cry. Why are you losing hair? Are you turning into a monster? Because mum's sick, so... Why are you sick? Because... Are you too tired? Dad says you're very tired... Be good. Mum's not tired. Mum still has to make a kimono for you. I don't want the kimono anymore! Then you won't be so tired and you'll stop losing hair! Hush now. If I don't make you the kimono then will you become a model? I just can't master sewing, no matter how hard I try! When I see Kristie, I know I want to be a model too, so that I can model your clothes for the world to see! Come, don't cry. Mabel... You're so good at art. Draw my eyebrows for me. I'm sure you'll make me look pretty! Okay? Stop crying, okay? Don't cry... Come. Thank you very much. Baby... What are you doing? Nothing... What are you doing with Mum's clothes? You can tell me. I like... I like Mum's scent... I'm afraid of losing it, so I'm keeping the clothes. If Mum is not around anymore, I can take them out and smell them, and then I'd remember her. Don't cry. Okay, let's break for dinner! -Hi, Howard! -Hello, Kristie! -After school? -Yes. How's your mum? Sissy? Hi, it's been so long! You're still as beautiful! You have clothes for alteration? It'll be a long wait. No, just dropping by for a chat. So how have you been? Is everything okay? Where's Mabel? Oh, these days she spends more time with her dad and grandma. And Howard helps out in the shop. Sissy. You... Oh... Fourth stage. You're not removing it? I can't. The cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, so I’m undergoing chemotherapy. It's not too bad, only injections. You can't even remove it... Are you still modelling? How's your boyfriend? Sissy... -Come, let's sit down and talk. -Okay. How have you been? It must be tough on you. Not really, it's okay once you're used to it. Hello? It's Grandma from Hong Kong. Hello? Hi, Mum. Yes, yes. Been busy lately. Yes, she's here. Hold on. Say a few words to Mum. Hello? Oh, yes. Yes, it's fine. You need to change the air conditioner? What? I'll get Mun to send the money tomorrow. I will. I'll definitely go for the wedding banquet. -Okay. -Okay, okay. That's enough, hang up now. Yes, it'll be the school holidays then. I'll bring the kids along when we come to Hong Kong. Okay, okay. Sure. Okay, bye-bye! See you next year! Okay, okay! Morning, Sissy's Seamstress! Oh, we open at nine a.m. Okay, thanks! Are my clothes ready? -Yes, here you go! -Thanks! -Come back again soon! -Okay, bye! Bye-bye! It's so late and your mum's not here yet? I don't know why. Enjoy your dinner! Okay, thanks. Bye! What happened? Where's Mum? Why did they leave me alone at home? Where's Mum? Tell me, quick! Dad took Mum to see the doctor. What are you doing? It hurts! Let go! Then why are you crying? Mum promised to make me a kimono. I want to learn, but I'm not half as good as her. I can't do it well no matter how hard I try. I know you can do it. You're her daughter. If she can do it so can you! Mum is sick now. I hope you can help her. So once you've mastered sewing, you can help Mum to relieve her workload. Do you want Mum to get well? Yes! Come, show me what Mum taught you. Mum says kimono fabric is very expensive, so I must be careful and not be nervous. See these patterns. I must be precise, or it will end up in a mess and not look good. Here, let me have a look. Yes, you've got it! Let me see! Yes! Don't cry, okay? Mum will worry. Come in. Be good. Come on, say hi to Mum? -Mum... -Mum... Have you... Had dinner? We're not hungry, we ate something at home before we came. Oh. Mabel was just practicing what you taught her, and she's improved a lot! Once I'm good at it I'll be able to help you. Then you won't have to work so hard, and you'll recover. That's great Mum, it will be easier now for you. I've tidied the shop and it's spick and span now. Even the lady next door wants me to help her. From now on Mabel will help you sew and I'll help you in the shop. We can go back once you have recovered. That's great... Mum agreed! What great kids! Here to visit your Mum? Have you eaten? I'm starving. You shouldn't go hungry! Why don't you go have dinner while I check on your mum. Come back and see Mum after your dinner, okay? I'll take them to have dinner, we'll be right back. Go on! We'll be back later, Mum. How are you feeling? Doctor, besides chemotherapy, what else can be done for my wife? We have already put her on three types of treatment, but the cancerous cells have spread to her liver, lungs, and brain. As your wife's breast cancer is hormone-receptor-negative, we are unable to use anti-cancer hormonal therapy. Besides, with her current physical condition, she cannot undergo another chemotherapy session. If not chemotherapy, then what can we do? We can try radiation. I am hoping that with radiation, we can target the cancer cells that have spread to her brain. Oh, and we are expecting a new drug in three months' time, we can then put her on the clinical trial. I... I agree... It's our last chance. I have to try it... It's teatime! Here's some tea and sandwiches that your husband lovingly made. Come, have some tea. Bring me the sewing kit, please! Come on, be good! The doctor wants you to rest at home, not work! I'm not working. I promised Mabel, please! Okay, okay! Have some tea first! You still remember how to thread a needle? Of course! Remember to tell our daughter that I helped in making the kimono too! Yes, yes! Mum! Come here. Mum, you're looking good today! Yeah! The kimono is almost done right? Mum, when can I wear it? How about Christmas? This will be your Christmas present, okay? Howard, help me take a picture of the three of you. I want to keep it near my bed. -Okay! -No! I want to take a picture with you! The way I look now... We'd better not. Just the three of you, okay? I have an idea. Okay! I'd like to powder my face. Okay! Okay! Okay! Ready, one, two, three! Dad and Mum! Both of us? Closer! Okay, now you join in, Mabel! Okay! Howard! Come and join us! Okay! Mum... Hug me too! Sure! Can I take one with Mum? Sure! One, two, three. Come, all together now! Come on, together! Here! One, two, three! Hello? Yes, that's the correct address. What time is the delivery? You're nearby? Great, thank you, bye-bye! Have you called everyone? Yes, I have. Wow! -Lady boss! -Lady boss! Oh! You seem to be doing all the work? -Can I be of any help? -It's okay. Aren't you hiring me as your assistant? How can I take you away from the shop? Hey, Hurry! Grandma! Help me with the food! Here, here, here! Here, keep it here! Don't dirty anything. When is Sissy coming? Wai Mun has gone to fetch her. It's a surprise party! She doesn't know! -Oh! -It was my grandson's idea. He is very smart, he took care of everything on his own! Sir, please sign. Sure! Where do I leave the cake? -Over there, please. -Okay. -Hi! -Hello! Kristie! Hi! Good girl! Come! Grandma! How are you, Auntie? -Lady boss! -Hi! How do you do! Come with me! This is my friend, Joseph! -Hello, Joseph! -Hi! -What's this? -Cake! Wow! It's beautiful! -Oh, where do the presents go? -Over there. -I'll help you! -Thanks! -How's your Mum now? -She's much better! She got me to buy her some new magazines, so she could check out the latest trends! That's great. I really miss her. -I'll put up the photo first! -Okay! -Do you want to take it out? -Yes! I'll help. -Do I take everything out? -Yes, everything. Be careful! How many candles? I was afraid it won't be enough! Thirty candles! Where do I put them? Here, here, here... I think the phone's ringing! Hello? Sissy's Seamstress. Just relax. Let's try one. When I told Timothy of my decision to undergo a mastectomy, I thought he would leave me, but he didn't. Only then did I realize, when one door closes, another door opens. Perfect! By forsaking all the beautiful clothes, I got to keep the most amazing piece of all. That is... my body. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
