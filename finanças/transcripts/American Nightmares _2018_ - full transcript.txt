(ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (KEYBOARD CLACKING) Every time I delete Reggie's email, he just starts up a new account, and then, the hate letters start (PHONE RINGING) all over again. One day he says he still loves me, and the next day, he's threatening to kill me. You don't return my calls, bitch. Why the fuck you don't return my calls, bitch? Why the fuck... I've tried to tell him that we're not meant for each other, we're not supposed to be together, but he's not listening. Well that's because psychos don't listen to anybody. I mean, you only dated him for six months before he started to hit you. He done lost his damn mind. (SMOOTH R AND B MUSIC) You should write an article about what an asshole he is. I just want to find a good man. How hard is that? I mean, why does it have to be so freakin' hard? Aww, honey. It's the law of supply and demand. The supply is low and... (KNOCKING) They think we're too demanding. Yeah, and it seems like every freaking date I go on is a disaster. I would try going lesbian, but I like dick too much. (LUCY LAUGHING) I have a certified delivery for Miss Sha-nicka Williams? It's Shanicka. Thank you. Here's to the dick. - (GLASSES CLINKING) - Here's to the dick. And lots of it.

(BOTH CHUCKLING) I wrote poetry in college, but it's hard to get anybody to read it. Really? - Yeah. - I love poetry. I do, yeah. I love, uh, Giovanni, Angelou. "The caged bird sings with a frightful trill, "of things unknown... "But longed for still." Mmm. I love that. I'd love to read your work some time. Of course.

(REGGIE STAMMERING) Listen, who do you think sent you the free gift certificates Hmm? Think about it. Let it ponder, let it simmer in your soul real quick. It was me. The fuck, it was me! Why would you do something like that? I'm Reggie, baby. Reggie, that's what Reggie do. I do shit like that to prove shit to your dumb ass to teach you a lesson. You know why? Because you always criticizin' people, baby. You know what I'm sayin'? You always tryin' to find somebody that fits everything on your perfect man list. "You not this. "Oh, you don't have that." Bitch, please. Don't call me a bitch. As a matter of fact, I want you to leave now, Reggie. Bi-tch. I'm tryin' to make a point to you that there's no such thing as a perfect man. Take your weave off, it's too tight, huh? And if you can't find your own perfect man, you gotta rent a goddamn robot. That's as perfect as it's gonna get. So you, knowin' you, you could program him up, and do whatever you want. That's you, that's what the fuck I did. Oh, you got jokes now, huh? (SHUSHING) Hold on now, hold on.

I love stuff like that. Mmm, mmm, mmm. (WOMAN LAUGHING) I love these tattooed titties even more. Get ready to pay me, girl. (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) That's weird, man. (MYSTIC WOMAN CHANTING) They just took over my screens too. (OMINOUS MUSIC) STUART: It's like he's forcing us to watch it. Ah. This story involves our justice system. (MR. MALEVOLENT CHUCKLING) Well... There's nothing more frightening than that. We call this The Prosecutor. (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) JAMAL: What should we do? STUART: Let's just watch it and see what happens. The defendant, Floyd Johnson, wants you to believe that on the fateful night in question, he was home alone, passed out drunk. We have an eyewitness that saw Floyd Johnson leaving where the murder happened moments after those gunshots. (GUN FIRING) Floyd Johnson destroyed the lives of his family by murdering them in cold blood, leaving a seven year old boy, a nine year old girl, and a beautiful wife laying in crimson pools in their own home. They are screaming out from their grave... (SIREN WAILING) That you must bring this man to justice, and find him guilty of murder. (GAVEL BANGING) And with that speech, Country Prosecutor Raymond Moreland secured the conviction of Floyd Johnson, and made himself a statewide celebrity. Now, after four years as Texas Attorney General, Moreland has just announced his candidacy for Governor. Mr. Moreland, thank you for joining us this evening. Thank you Chris, good evening, I'm very happy - to be here tonight. - That's um, that's some decent coverage, buddy. - Look at that. - And, I'm very proud of the fact that I've sent more depraved criminals to death row than any other prosecutor in the history of the great state of Texas. Can I get your autograph? (LAUGHING) Wouldn't life imprisonment accomplish the same thing? - (GUARD LAUGHING) - Exodus 21:24, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." I'm very happy to be doing God's work. Will you be attending the execution of Floyd Johnson? I will not. I will be at home spending long overdue family time with my wife and my beautiful children, John and Missy. CHRIS: Thank you for joining us, Mr. Moreland. Good luck with your campaign. - Matthews! - What? What the hell do you think you're doing? Nothing! Stop creeping around! Weirdo! I'm not creeping around, and get back to rounds! You big doofus. Hey, Floyd. Sorry about that, man. He's a bit of an asshole sometimes, huh? Don't worry about it. CHIEF AID: All right, I'm looking at the poll numbers coming out of Dallas-Fort Worth, and it looks like you're up five points right now. That poll showing Dallas-Forth Worth. What did we do in West Texas, Odessa, Uvalde? West Texas, lookin' like we're up around three right now so we probably need to spend a little bit more time over there. - We're up three? - Yeah, we're up three. - Permian Basin, all... - Up. - That's fantastic. - Yeah. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Mr. Moreland, I have to talk to you right away. Okay, okay, about what? I've been calling you and writing you and you haven't answered me. What can I do for you? You already know, we have to stop the execution. I told you, that man I saw on TV last year, the one that they arrested for the home invasion robberies. Chester Pinkett? - Yes! - Yeah. As soon as they put his face on TV, I realized he's the one that I saw coming out of the Johnson house. We've made a terrible mistake, we both have, but it's not too late for us to correct it! Who else have you told about this? - What? - Your husband? Have you told your husband? No. You haven't told your husband, why not? You know why. That's right, I do. 'Cause your husband was accused of terrible things, and I made those things go away. You know they weren't true. It was his ex-wife out for revenge. Says you, but the things he was accused of, they destroy families. And you never know when those things come roaring back, and they come... Roaring back. And you never know what could spring it, it could be just one phone call. You bastard... Don't you ever show your face here again. It's not good for you. You're disgusting. RAYMOND: Make sure she gets right home. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. (CAGE DOOR CLANGING) MISSY: How come you didn't go see that bad man die tonight, Daddy? Missy, I didn't go because my job's completed. I would rather be with Mom and you kids than go to some execution. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me. My friend said you were gonna pull the switch all by yourself. Hey, you two hush. This is not proper dinner conversation. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Now both of you, just eat your vegetables. ("HAIL TO THE CHIEF" BY JAMES SANDERSON) Hey, I told you never to call me at dinner. This is family time. It's important to Betty and I... CHIEF AID: Sir, I got a call from the prison. Floyd Johnson escaped. What? Oh... Hold on. What are you talking about? That's impossible. They think he had help from a guard and-and maybe one other prison employee... - Your fault, guys. - There's a manhunt on. How long ago did he escape? CHIEF AID: I-I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Find out, you idiot! Right now, call the police and get a squad car sent to my house to protect my family. CHIEF AID: Absolutely, sir. I'll tell them to send a squad car over... (STATIC CRACKLING) Hey, hello, hello? Hello, are you there? God... Uh, love, I'm gonna be right back, okay? (EXHALING LOUDLY) (THUNDER BOOMING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Betty, did you turn out the lights? Guys? (EXHALING LOUDLY) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Betty? (THUNDER BOOMING) Missy, John? Floyd Johnson, what have you done to my family? (GUN FIRING) Floyd! Floyd! Where are my wife and kids? Floyd, look, you think you got a raw deal, I get that, I do, okay? (GROANING) Floyd, tell me where my family is! And then, yeah, then, you and I, we can talk about you getting a retrial. A retrial, Floyd! You hear me? FLOYD: I heard you. (GUN FIRING) (RAYMOND GASPING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (RAYMOND BREATHING HEAVILY) RAYMOND: If you hurt my wife or my kids, I will kill you, you son of a bitch!

(GARBLED POLICE RADIO TRANSMISSION) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SIRENS WAILING) What are you idiots doing? What are you doing? Floyd Johnson did this! You guys are idiots, Floyd Johnson killed my family, you should be out tracking him down! Get him, Goddamn it! And uncuff me! I can have all of you out of work tomorrow! I'm gonna be Governor of the state of Texas. The great state of Texas won't have you in it! Why aren't you even listening to me? Sir... Hi. CHIEF AID: What happened? What do you mean what happened? It was Floyd Johnson. Floyd Johnson came in here, the lights were out, he killed my family, and he almost killed me! CHIEF AID: Sir, I don't understand. You-you don't understand? You're the one that called me and told me he got out of jail, he escaped from jail. You-you called me. CHIEF AID: I didn't call you. It-it was less than an hour ago. You called me and you-you said he escaped from jail. I was having dinner with my family. Floyd Johnson was executed a half hour ago by lethal injection. That's impossible. That's impossible, 'cause he killed my family. He killed my family, Floyd Johnson was here. Look, look, he shot me. - Sir... - He... - Sir... - Sir, my ass! Floyd Johnson was right here! He killed my family! Don't look at me like that. I was shot, there was blood, and, I'm innocent. You know I'm innocent. Guys like me aren't guilty, I'm innocent! I'm innocent! (SCREAMING) Please! John? Johnson? You did this to me, you son of a bitch! He did thi... (WHEEZING) You're not... Hey, no! No, no, no! No! No, please! (MACHINERY WHIRRING) Please! Please! No! No! He thought justice would be delivered to the low and undesirable, but was sadly mistaken. (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) (MYSTIC WOMAN CHANTING) (JAMAL LAUGHING) JAMAL: What is she, talking some voodoo? Don't we have some like, translator software or something? Huh... Ah. This symbol of treason brings to mind a story entitled White Flight.

It cost more than your whole year's crack budget, you hear me? Just pretend it's filled with malt liquor, welfare checks, then you'll do just fine. (BOX THUDDING LOUDLY) Hey, aren't you, uh... You damn right. (SIREN WAILING) (SPITTING) That welfare baby deserved every lick I gave him. Whether he stole that car or not, believe me, he was guilty of somethin'. Uh huh. And who catches hell for it? Me. All because of some Black Lives Matter or BS. Bastard cost me my job, got me livin' out here, but all that's about to change, sure there. Hey, hey! No more inside? You just gonna leave it out there on the sidewalk? Ain't you supposed to bring it in? Hey, hey! (LOUD CRASHING) Damn! I thought this country was supposed to be great again. (UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC) Molly, it's here! MOLLY: I'm comin'. You shoulda seen the asshole they had deliver it. If I had any compunction about gettin' us outta here, that asshole and his lazy nigger eponymous America coon, they settled it for me. Ooh wee, ain't she a beaut? It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be. This technology has to be big, 'cause of what it has to do. Okay, so you know I've been wanting to get us and the girls away from all this racial mixing? Mm-hmm. - So... - Mm-hmm? If you think it'll be okay... I'll be. I wouldn't have sold my daddy's antique Klan robe, my beer can collection, my rifles, the pick-ups, and my autographed picture of Ted Nugent if I didn't think it was gonna work, would I? - Okay. - Honey, by midnight tonight, you, me and the girls, we gonna be in another dimension, in a land, far, far away.

You're black! (BOTH LAUGHING) What? What's so funny? What? Not black skinned, black hair. Who gives a rat's rear end about black skin? It's... (ANGEL CRYING) It's black hairs, they's the problem. Nasty black bastards. They, they don't belong here. I just wish we could get rid of all the black bastards. You know, the, the little black-haired monkeys. Nothin' good ever came from a black-haired monkey. She wasn't an animal. (ANGEL CRYING) She was my wife. Shh-shh-shh. Your wife? You married one of 'em? You're a dirty black rug lover? God! You're lucky you got blonde hair. Despite my... Personal opinions on the matter, current law says all we can do is lock your ass up, but that could change here next election. Yeah. Yeah. Wait a second. Wait a second. You got a little black-haired runt! That's Angel, you can't shoot her! Yeah, we can't shoot Angel, 'cause our weapons don't work when they're this small.

(WOMEN MOANING AND LAUGHING) - Yo, Stu? - Hmm? That babe that you recorded working her snatch with a big-ass dildo, did she ever pay you? Nope. She was supposed to send me $800 by Friday, but she flaked. So what did you do? What do you think I did? I put up 50 screenshots on her Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and then I sent the entire batch to everyone on her contact list. For real? Yeah. Damn, Stuart! You one cold-ass dude. Hey. But I love it. Hey, everyone else paid their taxes. I got a hacker rep to protect. That's true. Hold on, let me see if she, uh, took those photos down yet. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KEYBOARD CLACKING) What the fuck? JAMAL: What's up? Looks like she killed herself. Over the photos? Nah, no way. I don't know, maybe. I mean, it was the next day. Shit, man.

That was before I knew you looked like death warmed over. I'm gonna need another two. Could you give me a second? (MR. PREEVY COUGHING) I'm tellin' you, his type got money hid all over the place. You make sure he don't finish too quick. Normally I wait in the car... But given your condition, I figured, you know, I'd just hang out here in case you pass out or somethin'. That's fine. (MR.

(EERIE WARBLING) JAMAL: Where do you think that guy got his suit from? STUART: I think he killed a pimp in the 1800s. Now our next story deals with the perils of combining an empty head with a big mouth. It's called Hate Radio. (STATIC BUZZING) (EERIE WARBLING) Are you fuckin' kidding me? JAMAL: What's up? STUART: I swear I just saw a picture of myself. That's weird, man. Welcome to another wonderful night. You're listening to the best talk radio program in the world. I am your brilliant and smooth-tongued host, Mr. Hugh Bluff. And I got a message for all you race hustling, feminazis, libtards, angry gays, welfare moochers, professional victims. Huh, did I leave anybody out? Look, whatever your hustle is, all right, you my wanna change the station now before you get your itsy-bitsy feelings hurt. These crypto-lesbian man-haters attending the university of fruits, flakes and nuts up there in Berkeley, California, are redefining rape as any time a man gets a rush of blood into his nether regions within 50 feet of an x chromosome, as a bunch of castrated, feminized, emasculated, metrosexual pansies are allowing themselves to be dominated by the weaker sex! I mean, we didn't have maniacs like Ted Bundy back in the 50s, you know why? 'Cause most of the women had their priorities straight. Now time to open it up to the callers. Jake from New Mexico, you are on the line. Go ahead. JAKE: Mr. Bluff, my ex-wife never worked at all, besides, like, raising the kids and stuff, and she got the house and full custody. And now she's got my own kids hatin' on me because I hit the bitch a few times. I feel for you, Jake. But you know what some people say? Behind every man charged with domestic violence is a woman who just wouldn't shut her mouth. Now, one of my favorite callers, Felix, you are on the air. How's it hanging? FELIX: Mr. Bluff, I want to expand on your comment about Ted Bundy. Has it ever occurred to you that guys like Ted, or this new avenger they call The Chopper, were actually doing a public service? How so? FELIX: Serial killers remind women that they need men around to protect them. It might be the only thing that keeps them from declaring all-out war on us. Hail The Chopper. That's why we like your phone calls, Felix, because you bring a unique perspective to the program. Right now, it's time to pay the bills. We'll be right back after these commercial messages. What do we got here? "From your biggest fan." (LAUGHING) Oh, wow! (LAUGHING) Look at that. (SIGHING) Yes, sir. (LIQUOR POURING) Make America Great Again. What the hell? Fucking libtards. ♪ When Johnny comes marching home again ♪ ♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪ ♪ We'll give him a hero welcome then ♪ ♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪ ♪ The men will cheer and the boys will shout ♪ ♪ The ladies they will all turn out ♪ (HUMMING HAPPILY) Who's the best radio talk show host in the country? You are. (OMINOUS MUSIC) What the fuck? (GROANING AND SCREAMING) (GASPING) Jesus! (SCREAMING) (SOFT THUDDING) (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) Are you all right? Hey, can you hear me? HUGH: So I ask you, where's it stop? How long before real men stand up and take your God-given rights back? Are we just supposed to slink off into some dustbin of world history as the politically and vaginally-correct crowd create a new gynocracy in which we no longer have a place? (FEMALE HUGH GASPING) What were you doing out in front of Hugh Bluff's place tonight? Where am I? Who the hell are you? Shut up, bitch. Come on man, I am Hugh Bluff! Stop imitating Mr. Bluff. It's disrespectful. Wait a second. I recognize your voice. Y-you're Felix. Calling my program all the time. You gotta let me go, listen, no! (MUFFLED SCREAMING) Your program? You got a lot of nerve saying that. And, the given name is Felix, but you can call me Chopper. (FEMALE HUGH SCREAMING MUFFLED) What do you think? Ah, here we go. Okay. (SCRAPING) Wait a second, wait a second! Listen to me! I'm not a woman! I'm Hugh Bluff! No, not that! (FELIX CHUCKLING) - Look, man! - Yeah. You're about to make a big mistake! (GAS HISSING) You fuckin' psycho! What the fuck's the matter with you? I'm Hugh Bluff! (FLAME WHOOSHING) No, please! Please don't kill me with fire! Open wide. FEMALE HUGH: No, I'm Hugh Bluff! No! I guess that's what happens when you walk a mile in another person's high heels. - (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) - No way. JAMAL: He got flamed. (MYSTIC WOMAN CHANTING) Whoa. That was sick, man. (EERIE WARBLING) Oh. Now this is what happens when an evil lie becomes reality. (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) It's called The Healer. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (GOSPEL SINGING) Benighted ones across the globe, God has used me as a vessel to heal and restore. (MAN GROANING) Perfection revealed! (CONGREGATION CHEERING) Tumors, arthritis, blindness, all manner of illness and disease have been vanquished as we break the mirror of the devil's reflection and reveal God's perfection. Perfection revealed! The man stands! Praise the Lord. He'll make the blind see. This Sunday, I will bring my ministry and vibrant health to your town so that you can see in person the perfection revealed. Raise your hands above your head! God's perfection revealed! Come on Lord and show me! Because as you know, I bring the healing, and you bring the faith. In God we trust. That new spot's gettin' some good reaction, huh? Yeah, we've already had a 20% spike in book sales online. And we got enough product for tomorrow? I increased inventory across the board, but we do have a slight problem here. The Tears of Jesus. Two drops a day will chase the imperfection away. Yeah, only they're empty. We can't have Tears of Jesus without Jesus' tears. (WATER POURING) Straight from God. After all, everything comes from God, right? Oh, jeez, Janet. Sunglasses, sunglasses! I mean, folks out there get one look at your fucked-up eye, and they won't believe I'd be able to heal a paper cut. First question will be, "Why can't Bishop Love fix yo raggedy-ass eye?" Yes, sir. And you know, when you're signin' my autograph, I make my Bs bigger, okay? Enough of that right now. I need to get back to the hotel so I can rest up for tomorrow. (BIRDS CHIRPING) MAN: That's him, that's the Bishop! MAN: There he is! - There's Bishop Love! - There's the Bishop! - Oh, help us! - Help us! Come on, brothers and sisters! MAN: Please, sir! We need you! Tomorrow! God bless you all! - (ALL TALKING) - Bishop, help us, please! Please! (SIGHING) I don't want none of that. Look, Janet, pull the car around to the service entrance out back. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Now where the hell is Janet? I got this honey waitin' on me back at the hotel for a private laying on hands. (BISHOP LOVE GROANING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Jesus. God won't get you out of this one, Bishop. Who the hell are you? This ain't about me. It's about my daughter. She had faith. She had plenty of faith. She bought your books. Your prayer cloth. She drove miles to have you shrink her tumor, then practically bathe in your Tears of Jesus. A lot of money wasted on snake oil that could have bought honest medicine. Okay. How can I help you? Money? I don't want your damn money! I want you to see my daughter. She was beautiful, but when she died, she looked like this. (FLIES BUZZING) Oh my God! You oughta stop that God routine. 'Cause if He's up there, He's got nothing for your triflin' ass. (GUN COCKING) Open your eyes. She died in pain. Great pain, and nothing can bring her back. But I found magic, and some real tongues to speak in. (ROSCOE SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) There is no magic. There are no tongues! I can't do it and you can't either! That's right, sweetheart. Hold it there. Oh, baby... They ain't Jesus' tears, but they work. Now, drink. No. Drink. Don't make me pick up this gun again. Drink! (OMINOUS MUSIC) Now we wait. (SIREN WAILING) Bishop Love, over here! OFFICER: We need to get them transported. It don't matter. - You've got the power. - Get 'em both. The sick and the crippled, they'll be drawn to your perfection, like flies to shit. Go to hell, old man. OFFICER: Okay sir, let's go. Easy. Hands on the hood. Now over there. - Bishop? - Oh, yeah. (FINGERS CRACKING) Thank goodness we put that emergency GPS app on your phone. Ow, damn! Ow, my hand! CLYDE: Probably cramping from being tied up so long. Yeah. (ROSCOE LAUGHING) ROSCOE: How ya feelin'? Now what is your psycho ass laughing at? (ROSCOE LAUGHING) God is good... Bishop. (LAUGHING) Get me out of here, Clyde. - Yes, sir. - Ow, damn! (BONES CRACKING) Ow, my hand! My eyes! Mine too. I-I-I-I can't see right. Me either. Huh, it seems like it's better without 'em. Give me those. What did you do? I made you a healer. Are you okay, sir? (SCREAMS) Don't touch me Janet, goddamn it! Don't you fuckin' touch me! But I can help you! BISHOP LOVE: No, do not touch me! - But I can't help... - Stop! My... Wait a minute. This can't be. Oh my God! It's a miracle! This is not a miracle, I've gotten your scar! Well I ain't takin' it back. This is your fault, old man! This is your fault! - (GUN FIRING) - Put the gun down! Put the gun down! (BISHOP LOVE GROANING) - Drop your weapon! - Drop it! (ROSCOE LAUGHING) ROSCOE: I called some friends of mine to join us out here, Bishop. (PEOPLE GROANING) Stay away from me! Get the fuck away from me! (PEOPLE GROANING) Get away from me! What the hell are you doing? Get away! (ROSCOE LAUGHING) Get away! (PEOPLE CRYING AND LAUGHING) MAN: It's a miracle! (EERIE MUSIC) (SKIN CRACKING) Perfection... Revealed. (STATIC BUZZING) (EERIE WARBLING) So I guess he became a healer after all. (MYSTIC WOMAN LAUGHING) (WOMEN MOANING) Oh shit! Check it out dude, I hit pay dirt! (JAMAL CHUCKLING) Lesbian threesome action? You are the man, Jamal! Yes! Where's the feed coming from? JAMAL: I don't know. The IP address keeps changing. STUART: It feels like another ghost feed. Yeah. But these girls can feed me anytime. Uh, whoa, whoa. Whoa, what's she doing? No, no, no, don't close your laptop baby! Baby, don't close your laptop! Whew. Close, whew, that was close. (EERIE MUSIC) (WITCHES WHISPERING) These bitches think they're witches or something. Whatever, as long as they put out before they're done. (WITCHES WHISPERING) How can these fools believe in this shit in the age of high tech, you know? STUART: Is something wrong with your screen? What the... (MYSTIC WOMAN CHANTING) (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) (STATIC BUZZING) (EERIE WARBLING) That's weird. STUART: This guy's a real piece of work. This is a story that may rattle you. (RATTLE RATTLING) (MYSTIC WOMAN CHUCKLING) It's called Thy Will Be Done. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) It's like he's controlling everything. Cool, I got 'em back. Thought I almost lost it. That can't be real. Dude, it's gotta be a trick. (STATIC BUZZING) This is really pissing me off now. STUART: We're just along for the ride. Remember, your procedure is a day from tomorrow. If you have any questions at any time, call our after hours number on the bottom of the pre-op instructions. Okay. You're gonna be okay. Thanks. (DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC) Excuse me? Excuse me, please, can you help me? My little girl just wandered off, - I don't know where she is! - Oh God... Please help me! - I'm so sorry, I haven't... - She's just a baby, and she's all alone, and I don't know where she is! Here, wait, I have a photo right here of her! - (GINA GASPING) - Shut up! Come on, close the door. (GINA SCREAMING MUFFLED) That's it, watch her head. Careful. Here we go. (GINA SCREAMING MUFFLED) (GINA BREATHING HEAVILY) So we take that off, you promise you're not gonna scream? Aw, you're so cute. (WILLIAM LAUGHING) (TAPE RIPPING) (GINA BREATHING HEAVILY) Where am I? What is this? Well, it's what we call a rescue. For the life of your child. I don't have a child. Oh yes, you do. Inside of you. Remember, you were gonna kill it because it was somehow inconvenient to you? Hey, if you didn't want a child, you shouldn't have opened your legs. I was raped. I was raped! It's still a life inside of you. Are you not hearing me? I was abducted and raped! You have no idea what he did to me. What it did to me. Being raped does not mean that you can hurt an innocent. It's not innocent. It's ugly. The next eight months can be easy, or they can be hard. - Please, please... - But you will have this baby. I'm a good person. This thing that is inside me, it is not good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up. You need to trust in God as we do, right? Let's let God decide what's good and what's not. Okay, sweetie, here we go, open wide. Open your mouth, sweetie. Open wide. Come on, come on, open up. You don't wanna die, do you? You gotta eat, come on. Come on. - Open! - Come on, open up. Open up, sweetheart. - Open, just come on... - Open! - Give out of the way. - All right, okay, fine. - Move. - If that's what you want. Okay, fine. - Mm-mmm. - Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, it's okay, it's okay, come on. (GINA GRUNTING) That's right, there we go, good job. (SPITTING) Fuck you! (LEANNE CHUCKLING) If that's how you want it... Fine. Naughty girl. (WILLIAM GRUNTING) Yeah, you just keep on being disobedient, right? (GINA GROANING) Hold her, hold her! Give your face, give it! Give it! - Oh yeah. - There. WILLIAM: Yeah, get out of there, get out of there. - That's right, that's right. - I got it, I got it. You will nourish your child. No! (WILLIAM CHUCKLING) There you go. Ooh, this is gonna be delicious. God still loves you. He still loves you, and you're gonna have a baby. There we go. (GINA GROANING) (WILLIAM LAUGHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You know, if you'd only eat, we wouldn't have to do this. - Okay. - Mm-mmm. Oh, wait. You-you'd rather eat, huh? - Uh huh. - Yeah? I-I don't, I can't hear you. What-what's that? (SAUL SCREAMING) No, no! (SAUL CHOKING) (GINA BREATHING HEAVILY) No! (SAUL GROANING) (GINA BREATHING HEAVILY) (TENSE MUSIC) (SAUL GROANING) Goddamn it! Hey Saul, I'm back. SAUL: Leanne! I'm up here, I got locked in! What? SAUL: She-she-she locked me in! - She... - No, are you kidding me? - Oh, God! - Oh, God! You're such an idiot, I never should have brought you into this! - She fucking escaped! - Go find her! SAUL: Damn it! (WILLIAM WHISTLING) (GINA BREATHING HEAVILY) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Go down the tunnel, go through the tunnel! Where is she? (GINA BREATHING HEAVILY) (GINA GRUNTING) (WOOD CLATTERING) Where do you think you're goin'? I will not have this child. I will not have this child! I will not have this child! (LOUD THUDDING) - No! - No, no, stop, stop! - Get out of me! - Quit it! I won't! I will not have this child! I will not have this child! - Come on. - I will not have this child! Hey, her water broke! (GINA SCREAMING) Water broke, water broke! It's too early! It's too early, it's not good! All right, I'll get the car ready! Hold on, hold on, wait, it's comin' man, it's gonna, it's gonna come. LEANNE: All right, could you just get that off... WILLIAM: Yeah, I got it. (GINA GASPING AND SCREAMING) (STATIC BUZZING) (LEANNE SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Help me! Push! (GINA SCREAMING) It's coming, oh, it's coming! Do you see what happens when you trust in God? Miracles! (CHUCKLING) Miracles! (WILLIAM GASPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (DEMONIC SQUEALING) What the hell are you? Your superior. (WILLIAM, SAUL AND LEANNE SCREAMING AND WHIMPERING) (DEMONIC LAUGHTER) You will all be used to take my seed. Put simply, like her, you will bear my children, and you will die. Hey, check it out, homeboy. I'm a man, dawg. I can't have a baby. Well, why don't we let God decide that? (WILLIAM GASPING) (WILLIAM SCREAMING) (ELECTRICITY SPARKING) STUART: Turn it off, turn it off! (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) What the hell? - (BOTH LAUGHING) - God! He got us good. JAMAL: I think they were watching us. Yeah. Yeah, you-you're right. JAMAL: Oh my God! Hey, do you wanna go to the Spotlight? I need, I need a drink. Yeah, definitely. I think I'm gonna go for a double Long Island Iced Tea. - (LOUD SLICING) - Yeah. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (DEMON ROARING) No, no, no, no! (JAMAL SCREAMING) (WITCHES LAUGHING) (STATIC BUZZING) Apparently, perverts should exorcize their demons, before their demons exorcize them. (MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING) You've done very well. So I am going to reward you with a year of youth and beauty, my little dark princess. (LAUGHING) Do you have any more stories for me this year, hmm? But of course. (CHUCKLING) Ah. My, my, my. Now this is the most terrifying story of all. It's about to happen now, and strangely enough... It's about you. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull
