I'll film it, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Let's go, let's go. Yeah... Our streets! Our butcher's! What is this halal shit? Calm down, calm down. Please... This is our country. Please calm down. Stop it... Get out of my fucking way! ..please just get back. We don't want any bother, OK? Please just leave. What's in here? Oi, is this where you bring the young girls? Please stop filming, right? Please! Lads, please, please! Ha-ha! Here, that was sick! Oh... What a buzz, man! Well, I was living in, erm, what I thought was permanent tenancy. Only to be told that it's temporary, and that I was going to be put back in a hostel. They said it was supposed to be like a studio, but it's not, it's...it is...it's one room. My name's been on the waiting list for seven years, and nothing seems to happen. It's not like I'm asking for the world, I'm asking for a place to live - and every time you come back, they tell you the same thing. That they can't do nothing about it. He can't do this, can he? You're behind on your rent? Yeah...he put it up by 300 quid a month with no warning. No, he is within his rights to do that, unfortunately. He can't just kick us out - and my sister is out here... ..about to drop. With Annes being pregnant then, er... ..she's a priority, that would make her family a priority. Because, honestly, we've been on that list for SO long now. We've got 8,000 people on the waiting list. Erm, only 1,000 places come up for rent every year. Yeah, but you can house us...right? I take it that you're looking for a place of your own? Because I can get you a list of private rentals that we... No. No, no, we're a family. I...I take my niece, Sophie, to school if Carl and Annes are both working, I try and help out. No, Mr Hughes, er... There's a place opposite us, right? Number five, council place. It's empty. Jean, who used to live there, she always used to say that if she was to not be there, that we should have the house. Yeah, that's...that's gone. It's allocated. Erm... To? A family. Moving in today. So, what...what are we going to do? Have your sister call us, or better yet, come in and see me. No, you can just... Get Annes... ..to call me. Right. OK... You going to help, or what? I'm quite strong for a little person, aren't I? Are you even...? I feel like I've got all the weight on this end. Yeah, yeah. Agh! Do you work in McDonald's? No, it's the new, erm... The chicken place towards town? It's like McDonald's, but it's more... ..chickeny. OK. So, how did you get this place? My dad...run off with a woman from the bingo. Ah. Yeah, nice. Long story. Er, Mum got MS... Oh, shit. So... So, yeah, we just...we had to wait for the right place for Mum. I mean, this has got a ramp and everything. Yeah, it's cos Jean was in a wheelchair, so... Aw. I'm Yaz. Geth... ..in. Gethin. Where are you from? St Anne's. That's not what you mean, is it? Have you got any... ..brothers, sisters? Brother, yeah. Man of the house. Thanks. What, you think Muslims don't like a smoke? Is that what it is? So, this... This chickeny...place. Is it any good? Fucking terrible. I've got a twat of a boss. Well, are they looking for people? Cos I need a job. Pretty much every day. All the time. I'll have a word. Fuck! Shit! I take it that's your mum. What gave it away? The halal bit. Don't look him in the eye. Right, you just going to sit there? Hiya. Eh? Cigarette... Cancer... Jean will be spinning in her grave. That house should be ours. Did you get her number? I never asked for it. I only helped with the settee. Not the girl, shit-for-brains. The woman from housing. What did you say to her exactly? I told her about the eviction. She wants to speak to you. Oh, here she is! Oi-oi! How many scores? About five in one game. Oh, five goals! Five in one game? Course she did. Top goal scorer. Shoes off, please. OK. Do you want a hand, Soph? Yeah. Come on, then. I seen someone's moving into Jean's house. Did you get any more shifts? So, what did they say about the eviction? Are they going to rehouse us? Well, Annes has got to go in. We need a house. We've been here for years, and these people just waltz in with... You helping them unload. Pinching houses off us now, right under our nosey-woseys, aren't they? Yeah. Carl? Yeah, I'm working 10 till 4. Geth fancies the girl. Shut up. Yeah, you've been over there, have you, helping them? Yeah, move into a house that should be ours. Well, I couldn't exactly ignore them, could I? Yeah. Are you hungry? Yeah. Wake up. What time is it? OK. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, I'll be in. I've got to go down Bessemer Road, someone's called in sick. If I weren't so knackered, I'd go over there and tell them that should be our house. Annes, just drop it. It's not their fault. They've got a family, they're trying to make ends meet. Whose fault is it, then? Annes? Look, Titch just sent me this... It's new council houses. We believe that housing is more than shelter. Home is a sanctuary for families, for communities. Your council and Drakefield Homes have taken it as our mission to provide these needs. Welcome to the future. Welcome to Pentre Porth. I'd love to have one of those. Mum, where's my bag? It's over there. Have you cleaned your teeth? Yeah. Soph? Yeah? You know how I said I was going to take you to school? Yeah. I've got to go to work now. So I'll see you later on, yeah? Yeah. See you in a bit. I start my shift at nine, any chance you could take her? Yay! Yeah! Don't let your daddy hear you celebrate like that. Then you flip it over. Yeah. Let's see if it's OK. I'm not too bad, am I? No, no, it's really good. You know what? For a first time, that's not too bad at all. That's really good, you did really well. Yaz, that's really, really good, you can be proud of yourself. Thanks. Do you think I'm going to be good at this? It's not rocket science, is it? I want to be as good as you are. You'll never be as good as I am. I'm Pizza King. Look at that! You have got lumps of cheese on the side. Yeah, but it'll melt. Aw, just put it in the oven and hope for the best. And you've got ONE bit of sweetcorn! I did tell you this job was shit. Yeah... ..but they were hiring. Yeah. He gave me the big sell, as well. He said that we were all associates and everything. Yeah, well...Jacob's always hiring associates or getting rid of them. This place... ..is a revolving door of associates. Hey, Geth? Listen, mate, quick word, yeah? Tomorrow morning, right? Try 10am for me, OK? Yeah? You'll feel better for it, I'll feel better for it, yeah? Start the day as we mean to go on. Yeah, remember that? Remember our values, mate. This is grim. Why did you suggest walking? Hey, why don't we get a bus? Oh, fucking... Hey, no rest for the wicked, eh, mate? Sorry? Fuck that. Yeah, it's happy hour, come on. Well, hurry up, come on. Coming, coming! "Oh, Geth, my legs are hurting!" # I never thought I'd miss you # Half as much as I do # As soon as I wake up # Every night, every day # I know that it's you I need # To take my blues away Boo! # It must be love, love, love # It must be love, love, love # Nothing more, nothing less # Love is the be-e-e-est. # Whoo! Thank you, Wembley! See you next week. I'll be at the front, like, doing the big numbers. You can come up, every now and again... We do a bit of a duet so you can have a bit of a moment, but then... He's on one, isn't he?! He's on one. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You didn't hear yourself. I hear you've got a thing for someone. That butcher fella's sister. No, the halal bloke? Yeah, Carl told me. Well, at least she'll be halal, eh? Got to say, I've seen her... ..she's cute. Yeah, you'd fuck anything. I'd fuck her. Remember when that butcher's was Dylan's? Oh, I used to hate having my hair cut there. Dylan knew everyone by name. That world has long fucking sailed, mate. At the warehouse, we used to look out for each other, but now... ..floodgates have been flung open to all sorts. My job's fucked. Shall I get some crisps? I'm fucking starving. Yeah, go on, then... Oi, there's nothing left for the likes of us. ..salt and vinegar. There's nothing here. Even if you go to college and get your qualifications, it doesn't mean you're going to be OK. Half the people at our place who've got qualifications, they're on the same contract as me. No... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Part-time... ..zero-hours. My dad was saying if there's no unions, there's no security. It's like the mines, but without the pride. Yeah, or the emphysema. What quality of life does my child have, growing up with two adults in one room? You haven't even listened to me. I've been on the waiting list for five years, mate. I'm throwing myself on your mercy. If there's any way that you can actually... ..find somewhere else we could go. How long? We've got hundreds of cases, Annes. And? Look...our budget has been cut to the bone, right? We haven't got enough people... Oh, my heart goes out to you. You have to play the game. Right, so, the fact that our landlord is about to evict us is a game now, is it? No, it's a question of resources. Can you find us a place? We can help you, OK? But you have to know that that help is for you, your daughter and your husband. What about Gethin? Look, I know it's harsh, but you can't treat him as family. He's a single man with no dependents. He's just not a priority. Well, he is to me. Does he work? Yeah, but he's... Let me just e-mail you some stuff over. He's on one of those zero-hour contracts, it's not enough. I'm doing the best I can, here, Annes, but you have to understand what I'm telling you - as far as we're concerned, as far as you getting your own place... ..your family is you, your husband, your daughter and your new baby. Yeah, yeah. Gethin's not your family. Oh...you need to stop growing, Miss. I saw Dad yesterday. Yeah? I just gave him some food. How is he? Same. Landlord's going to be here tomorrow - can you be here? Council will find us a place, won't they? Yeah, of course, I'll sort it. Yeah. See you later. Hi, mate. 2-piece of chicken, please... Yeah. ..with chips. 2-piece of chicken with chips! Fiver, bargain. If you give someone some extra chips, then they love you. Honestly. Is that a secret? Yeah. Just give them some extra... Even if you haven't, just tell them you've gave them some extra, and they're buzzing. You're just so good with people. Geth, show her. Don't, like, you know... Yeah, just show her. Yeah, no... That's all I'm... Ugh... He's such a twat. What are they? Malik gave them to me at work for covering his shift. Yeah, but what are they? Only one way to find out. Ready? Yeah. Three, two, one... Nothing's happening. Are you sure? I don't think your brother likes me. He's different in the house. Honest. You should see him with Mum, he's better than I am. Yeah? Mm. He sleeps at the butcher's... ..just to wait for the morning deliveries. Where's your mum? Er... Cancer. Liver, brain. Oh. Do you remember her? Yeah, I remember loads about her. I remember her in hospital... ..cos I was just sitting next to her, like, just listening to her... ..like, just breathing and... ..and I was there, actually, when... You know, she just... ..stops breathing. There's no hugs, there's no speeches, there's no goodbyes, there's no nothing. But... ..that's how people dies, isn't it? They just... ..stop. You don't have to talk about... No, it's fine, I don't mind. So, what about your dad? He was in the Army, and then after that, he worked making tellies... ..but they ended up moving the factory to, erm... Where did they put it? In Poland, I think. After that, gave him a pay-out, Annes says that that's what fucked him. It was like putting an alcoholic in charge of a brewery, she said. Mum was devastated when Dad left. I remember her saying, "How did they even meet? "She works down the bingo." Do you miss your dad? Once, I went camping in Brecon with my dad. I fucking hated it, it was shit, there was nothing there. He said that when he was in the Army, they'd just be out there for weeks, and he told me that... ..the same stars that you can see there... ..you can still see them when you're here. But... I can't. I can see some. Look. That's him. Look... ..can't we just get an extension, just a bit longer? Listen, I'd love to, but the builders are booked in for two weeks' time, to sort the place out, ready for the new tenants. Right, so you're definitely kicking us out then? Leave the heating on while you're out, it helps with the... We can hardly afford to have it on when we're in. Yeah, you know, since you put the rent up. I suppose you'll have to stop working, now you're pregnant and that? Oh, no. No, I'll clean right through the fucking birth. Gas and air in one hand, J-cloth in the other. You can't just kick us out. Whoa, now, right? Don't speak... I'm not some kind of twat who kicks you out, right? That's exactly what you are. I've lost sleep over this. You are. You've lost sleep? Yeah, I don't like to do it. You've lost sleep?! I don't even want this fucking house. We do. Look, I'm sorry, right? I really am. Just a month. That's all we're asking for, a month. Tell you what, right? What I'll do is, I'll have a word with a couple of people, and see if there's somewhere similar to this, maybe even better... ..right? Something that's more in your budget. Landlord says we have to go. How long have you got? Soon. Where are you going to go? Well...Annes is going down the council, see if... Hiya. You all right? What's happening? Annes know you're here? Who's been shitting in your cornflakes? They've cut my shifts. No warning, just got a text. Yeah, they can do that now. Just text you, and then... ..you don't work again. That's what landlords can do now. What? Stop giving you work? Put up rents and throw people out. You can come and live in my shed with me, if you want. Same again? Yes, please. Oi.. My mam has been on the waiting list for six years. Six years? She used to live in my grandad's house, right? One bedroom - her, my grandad and my two little sisters. Every flat she's been to look at, the Somalians have got it. It's ridiculous. Isn't it? I know for a fact they haven't been in this country as long as my mam's been on that waiting list, and I have to think to myself, "How are you getting these houses?" We are second class citizens in our own country. All the people that's moved in, people from all over the place... What does that say to people that live... Yeah, but we're all part of, like, the global economy thing, ain't we? There are no council houses. They've sold off the ones they already had. Let me speak. Yeah? Let me speak. It's not THEIR jobs on the line, though, is it? It's not loads of people moving in next to them. Everyone knows what's happened. People like us are getting fucked over. No-one gives a shit, and you know why. Because... It's because you're a lazy bastard. I've applied for so many other jobs, and you know what? I can't get my foot in the door because when I tick a box, I tick a box that says white. Working class. Yeah, but... If I was black and I could barely speak English, I bet I'd get fucking further off straight away! It's because the Muslims are taking over. Taking our jobs, our houses. You've seen it - they're taking over our neighbourhoods. They're taking over, and no-one gives a shit. We need to do something about it. A gang of men who raped and abused vulnerable girls in Huddersfield have been given lengthy prison sentences. A series of trials, the details of which can be reported for the first time, heard the 20 men, mainly of Pakistani heritage, targeted girls as young as 11. Yes! No. I swear. That was a good save. Up to here now, safer. I saw your mum the other day, she looked a bit unsteady. Is she all right? Oh, open goal! I don't know, she's got MS, erm... ..but we needed a place so... What about your dad? Is your dad not around? No, he's not in the picture, he left a while ago. Oh, right, OK. Juggling work and then looking after both of them, to be honest. Pick it up now. See you later. What do you want for your dinner? I don't know. Oh, you'd better think! What? He's all right. It's just good to keep an eye out though, yeah? On Soph. Hello? Annes? It's Hannah from the housing office. Can you talk? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I found you a place. Oh! Oh, my God! Thank you. Oh, thank you so much! Where? Cattwg estate. Cattwg estate? Well, that's miles away. It's a nice area. Yeah, erm... We'll have to change schools, GP... How am I supposed to do that? Annes... ..this is it, yeah? Mm-hm...what is it? Family hostel. A hostel? Yeah, it's not like a normal hostel. It's more like a one-bed flat with communal areas, and it's just temporary until we can get you something more permanent. Right, well, what about Gethin? You're our priority, Annes. But he's got to come with us! I'm really doing my best here. Are you going to take it? Annes, you have to think about this. This is your chance. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll take it. OK. When are you going to tell him? Tomorrow, I promise. Put it in the calendar, guys. Put it in the calendar. Next year, we'll remember this day as being "Gethin on time day." I'm early, actually. I know. Pigs are flying, as well. Blinking heck. Come on! I was only joking, man. Come on, sense of humour? Right, guys, back to work. See we've got two newbies started this morning? Sam and Jetti have gone? Mm. For good? Jacob's going to fit that revolving fucking door, I tell you. Stick it outside his office... ..one associate in, one associate out. What are you going to be, Geth? What? Well, it's not forever, is it? No... Yaz, can me and Geth have a word? Is that all right? Just for a sec. OK. Cheers, love. What's this say here? The badge? Mm, yeah. Manager. This badge... ..says respect, right? Now...we're partners in a business here, right? We're associates, OK? And we've got a responsibility to facilitate our customers' needs. Now... do you understand? What I'm saying to you? Yeah. Is that it? Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Jacob. Dad? Dad? Is there anything I can do, Dad? Change this fucking weather. People on the streets of Spain... ..fucking easy. Maybe you should move there then. Yeah, I will. Might buy a villa. Why don't you go to a hostel? Full of fucking idiots like me. They don't like you being here too long. Well, can I... Listen. You can do what the fuck you want, all right? Why are you here? When they closed the factory... ..that was it for me. No job. I was too empty... ..in here. Annes says you drank the redundancy. I couldn't handle all the... Every time I looked at you two, it reminded me of her. Was that so bad? Listen, Geth... Don't let this happen to you, hmm? I'm a fucking ghost. Don't become a ghost, Son. I'm homeless. I've got nowhere to live. I have to go down today and see an immigrant, an immigrant telling me... Well, that's the truth. That's the truth. I go down to a housing estate, an immigrant tells me that I cannot live here. Just because you perceive something doesn't make it true. I've got nowhere to live. I need to go and find somewhere to live. All right. For tonight. OK. You, sir, at the very back there. Thank you very much. You, sir, at the back. Geth, we need to talk to you about something. You coming? Where? This meeting, the new housing thing, it's starting now. I don't think there's any point, love. Come on, we should see. You two go, I'll look after Soph. No, we can all go. The four of us, yeah? All right. We believe that housing is more than shelter. Home is a sanctuary for families, for communities. Your council and Drakefield Homes have taken it as our mission to provide these needs. Welcome to the future. Welcome to Pentre Porth. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. I am Councillor Andrea Watkins. Lovely to meet you all - it's fantastic to see so many local faces. Let me introduce you to the panel. We have Carol Hodgkins, who is on the city planning development board. We have our CEO of Drakefield Homes, Andrew Higgs, is also here today. Our commitment is to bring new life to this area - new faces and income strands. That's why we're here. How many of these homes are available to the people who already lives in the area? Like the locals? What's your name? Lisa. Lisa, that's a great question, thank you very much. So we are currently in discussion with Drakefield about what's viable, but we are working with a 30% target for social housing. I want to know how many houses there are going to be. I don't want to know 30%. I want to know how many houses. When you say 30%, if you build 60 houses on that plot, that's only 20 houses that are going to be for what you call "affordable". That's not even going to cover the people in this room. In this current climate... In this current climate, we have to start at 30% and I will be working my hardest... As your councillor, I will be working my hardest to take that forward. You still can't tell us even what 30% means. Ten years ago, they built "affordable" houses. And we heard about "30%". In the end, it was 10% for local people. A lot of them couldn't afford it, and a lot of them had already been evicted from their homes. And all the houses were sold to people who drive Rolls-Royces or whatever. I work full-time and I've been homeless for four years. I mean, what sort of lists have you got going? What have you got to do to get on this magic 30%? In this day and age, it is unacceptable for somebody like yourself to be working and homeless. That is something we need to eradicate and we will be taking that forward so that we can escalate that further. Can you just tell us what affordable is? Affordability. I'm really glad you brought that up. OK. It says in the brochure that the flat prices start at 178,000. I can't afford that. Can anybody here afford that? No. When you say affordable, obviously you're talking about buying, right? And what about for rent? Sorry, sir, I didn't catch your name. It's Geth. Gethin, thank you very much. In terms of renting, which I'm feeling is what a lot of people will be needing, the rental portion will be handled by a housing association. Yeah, all right, so how many of THEM will there be? That's still under discussion, but we... Can't you give a straight answer? We're asking questions, you're just not giving us straight answers. Gethin's made a very interesting point. Gethin, what we know is the rent will be higher than council houses at the moment, but lower than the market value. So meaning most people in this room can't afford it. And you know that. You know that we're not sitting here with loads of money that we can just chuck at some flat. Because all you've done, you've just shown us what we can't have. We ain't even asking for something that fancy. We just want something better. I'm sleeping in my sister's shed, yeah? And she's fed up of it. One second, right? Right. This is why we're... Hey, listen, listen. My life, right, I'm on a zero-hour contract, which basically means I don't get paid anything, because I work like, what, six hours a week if I'm lucky. I've not got a bed. I sleep on a mattress, right? There's no toilet. I have to piss in the bush. I have to go round to fucking their house to have a shower. So, what...? Why have I come here today if you can't offer me anything? I understand your frustrations, I really do, but you see, sir, these are your perceptions of what is going on. Perception! My perception is I'm living in a fucking shed. Look... Right? You're not taking down minutes of the meeting because you'll leave here and it's forgotten. That young boy has been living in his sister's shed for a very long time - in damp, in cold weather. As your councillor, no-one understands your problems more than I do. I listen to people on a daily basis. It is not right, in this day and age, that we have people on the streets. Look, miss, I register your passion, I register your anger. It's not about passion, love, it's desperate people out there. I understand that. Yeah, can I ask a question? What about the indigenous population? I mean, if they're Muslim, they come in, they get everything. Setting up their own business advice, driving lessons. What about him? People like that... Please, ladies and gentlemen. Fuck off! I've been five years waiting, and I've seen people come in... I'm black, so I've got no problem with race, and they are banged in houses before me and my kids. So don't... Exactly. Exactly! The damage has already been done. We are divided. These people want to live together in a decent home. They don't want to be fighting, they just want a home. You are kidding yourself. We are all kidding ourselves if you think that you are going to get one of them. This is mad. Are you pleased with yourself that you've now shown us a posh place that we could never have? I'm happy to have a lively debate... Go back to the landlord - we'll speak to him and we'll tell him we just need a bit more time. He's got to understand that. If he doesn't, then I can look online. I'll ring up some agencies and see if we can get somewhere else private for the four of us. Or even if we all just go together, go down to housing and speak to them. Just tell him, Annes. What? We've been offered a flat. Right. Yeah. Right, good. Yeah, a sort of family hostel thing. Yeah? Yeah, Geth, and when she says family, it's a one-bed. There's no room for you. Tell me you're not taking it. Can't refuse it. You know we can't. You understand, yeah? When have you got to decide by? Tomorrow. You have got to decide by tomorrow? No, we've got to move by tomorrow, we've got to go there to secure it. Annes, if you take that flat, that's me... Look, maybe we can come back, yeah? It's not going to be forever. Maybe we can move into one of those new developments. It's just going to take time, Geth, so you just need to sort yourself out. You fucking believe that, do you? Geth. Geth! Uncle Gethin! Hey. You be good for your mum now, OK? Yeah? Serious? Are we actually going to do this? Are you going to do it? I'll film it, yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Let's go, let's go. Our street, our butcher's! What are you doing? What is this halal shit? All right, mate, calm down, calm down. Don't do that. This is our country. Please calm down. Can you stop, please? Get out of my fucking way. Get back. Look, we don't want any bother, OK? Please just leave. Oi, is this is where you bring the young girls? Please stop filming. Please. Lads, please. Where's the phone? That was sick! It's like, who the fuck, Geth? If they can do that in Zac's shop, it's like... It don't make you feel safe, does it? God, my mum's a fucking nervous wreck at the minute. You've got nothing to be scared about. Zac is really shaken up. He already thinks the whole world is against us. This hasn't helped. What happened to your hand? I was... ..playing with Soph. Sorry for going on. I just, um, didn't know who else to talk to. Nothing wrong, is there? No. You haven't been in much recently. It's just Jacob text me saying there was no shifts, so... Revolving door, innit? I still can't believe you posted that. Have you seen the hits it's got? What, that's a good thing? They're going to know it was us. Don't shit your pants. Who's going to find out? You don't know that, do you? At least we did something. Look, this immigration's no good for us. For me, immigrants taking my shifts, working for less. Yeah, but that's happening everywhere. That's what I'm saying. It's not the immigrants that's the problem, though. It's the Muslims. Trying to take us back to the Dark Ages. They hate women and they hate gays. That's me fucked twice. They hate us all. I knew this would end in trouble. What I'm trying to say is, we've got to stick up for ourselves. The rich stick up for the rich, the Muslims, they stick up for the Muslims. If we don't want them taking our houses, our jobs, our everything, then we should stick up for ourselves. Yeah? We are the ones that are losing out, Titch. Where'd you want to put it? I'll put it in there. Good job. Good to go? Let's get you in. Is your seat belt on? Geth. Hi. Hey. Are you OK? Yeah. Are you? I just think we need a chat. About what? Well, I haven't seen you much recent. At all. I've just got a lot going on. What does that mean? Are we still mates? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course we are. Good. So there's an open day at the college. Do you want to come? Nah. Why, why not? My face don't fit. Rubbish. Rubbish! You've got a lovely face. You have. You have got a lovely face. Have I? Mm. Geth! Sorry. Sorry... Sorry, Geth. Don't just walk away! Is it me you've got a problem with? I don't have a problem... Because I've got nowhere to live now. I'm very sorry, but we can't provide housing for every... If I leave here now and you don't help me, I'll be out on the streets. Really? What, are you calling me a liar now? Calm down, Mr Hughes. Am I not calm? Can you lower your voice, please? Oh, my God, don't make a scene, is that it? I can see that you're upset. I understand that you're in a difficult situation, but there is only so much we can do. What about him? Are you going to get him a place? I'm not getting in... Or her? Yeah, not a problem. I'm not. You just don't care. I do care. Not enough. If you just let me explain... How... How are they better than me? Oh... How? Please, look... They must be. I have got nowhere. Nothing. In MY city. I'm trying to explain to you that that's not how it works. We have a limited number of properties and we have to prioritise people. Then prioritise me. Prioritise me, please. I can't prioritise a single man with no dependents. OK, I understand that I don't meet the criteria. Can you just tell me what to do to meet the fucking criteria and I will do it. I promise you, I will do it and then you can give me a house and I don't have to spend the nights on the streets, because that's all I want. We are unable to help you here, but I can point you... Made no difference, then. I can point you in the direction of people who may be able to help you... You can't, though, can you? You can't, though. You say this, but you can't. None of you can. This whole place is fucking pointless, because you don't do anything for anyone who actually matters, because I should be here and they shouldn't, but you give them a place anyway. Sir! I need... Gethin! Dad... Just listen for one minute. Dad, I... I don't know what to do. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fucking go! Hi, Geth, it's me. I just want to say I'm really sorry for whatever happened before. I'd love to just forget about it... ..and check everything else is OK with you, because I noticed you're not... You're not at your house any more. If there's anything going on that you want to talk to me about, you know you can. Listen, I would love you to meet me after work. Give me a call back, OK? Bye. All right, piggy man? Fucking prick! Prick. Fuck you. Geth, what the fuck's happened to you? He knows it was us. What? The guy at the butcher's, he knows. That's it, that's fucking it. Let's go. Let's go. See you. Let's go! Come on! Run! Where the fuck's Geth? Come on, man, we've got to go. I had to do something. But... What? Just let them turn me into a ghost? Like I don't matter? Someone is going to take notice, you know? You regret it, though, yeah? You weren't to know he was in there. Geth. You weren't to know he was in there.
