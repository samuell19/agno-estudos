I feel great. My life's never been better. That's great to hear. In fact, I don't think I need to come here anymore. Okay, well we can discuss that. What's there to discuss? I just said I never felt better. Matt, you have a history of anxiety and depression and that doesn't typically just go away. Okay, yeah, I see what's going on here. You don't want to lose me as a patient. - No, no, that's not it. - Yeah, I think so.

No. What do you want? That's a tone. What do you want, Jess? Something's obviously up. I can tell by your voice. Tell me, what's going on? Matt. Okay, don't tell mom. Put him on speaker. Okay. Lori's motorcycle's parked at a motel. Oh Jesus, you're kidding, where? It's some motel on Kingsway. Oh, the 2400 motels? Those cute little cabins. Those cute little cabins? Yeah, yes. Was there another vehicle parked beside Lori's bike? Uh, I don't, there's a car there. I don't recognize it though. Were you following her? No, I wasn't following her. You say that like it's wrong. Yeah, it is wrong. Question, how did you happen to be there? I just stopped for a chicken burger and I looked across and I saw the bike. Does he have his meds? Maybe you should go down there. Do you want me to come down there? No, I do not want you to come down here. Okay good, wait her out. Remind him about my birthday. Don't forget about mom's birthday dinner tonight, okay? Take care. Hang in there, sweetie. Wha? I've been on speaker? Hang up. It might be nothing. Was that them? What happened? What happened? I don't want to talk about it. What your wife's in a motel all day and we're not gonna talk about it? All day? We don't know how long she was there. That's guesswork. I'm sensing it was long enough. What'd you say to me? Matt, was she there with a guy or what? I don't want to talk about it. Oh shit, she was there with a guy. No, no, okay? Would you please, please leave me alone. What did I say about pleading, Matt, huh, what did I say? You said it doesn't work. And? And? And you look like a dick. Right. Now did you see her come out or not? Oh my god. Oh my god, Matty, you didn't wait to find out, did you? Oh god, Matty, where is your backbone? Okay Jess, please... Well this is, this is your problem! Just leave it, just leave it, leave it, leave it. He gets it. I don't want to talk about it. You don't have to talk about it. Were you having problems with Lori? I just need to know, do I set another plate, or what? Yes, set a plate. Oh, so you did talk to her. What are you lurking out there? You talked to her, what did she say? I didn't talk to her. She sent me a text. She sent you a text? Sweetie, what did it say? It said she'd meet me here for dinner, okay, enough. Okay, so with Sean that's five. Hey. Hi, hey happy birthday. Thank you. Ow. Oh gosh, I'm sorry, here. What is that? This is for you. Now are you sure you're old enough to consume alcohol, young lady? I think so. You look beautiful. Thank you, have you lost weight? Uh yeah, I've been on a diet. I just eat meat. Wow, I found it obviously, hey baby. Hey, hey. Good to see you. What's up, dude? Hey. Hey. Could I please have some rice? I forgot to put any on my plate. I got it, I got it. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Wow, this is just fucking great. Well it should be great. It's take-out. I've had steak for take-out. TJ's and Malfer, their steaks are very tough. They could be in the UFC actually. Yeah, that's fascinating. So, Lori, what'd you get up to today? Me, um, well, you remember my friend Alexis, right? What about her? Alexis Nidem? Nidem, um, from track? Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. What about her? She's in town right now visiting her mom at a care facility, so I just went to go say hi. She's staying at a motel in Kingsway. She's at, she is? Yeah. And, which one? Oh gosh, what is it called? It's the only one on Kingsway, that one with the little cabins or whatever, the 2400, that's what it's called. Huh. Kingsway always freaks me out cause you think it's going one way and it's actually going the other, right? It's diagonal, it's weird. Anyway, she really appreciated my visit what with her mom just being in palliative care and all. It's just so... It's all hard. It's not, it's, she's in palliative care. It's not... No, no, that you could be there. What is palliative care? Really? It's the last stop. Oh. Right, the end, like at the end of it. - Bummer. - Okay. They're really close. So tell us more about Alexis. Uh, it's just been really tough on the family. Her father passed away last year so you know, anything, I just felt like it was the right thing to do. Well yeah, what did he die of? What do you care? You ask that every time. It's interesting. It's okay, um, it was actually a stroke. Oh my god, that's amazing. Really sudden. It was, you know, he slurred his speech, his face drooped and then 20 minutes later he was just gone. Wow. I remember when Matt's face drooped after he... You never told me that. Yeah it's just, you know. The whole left side of his face just went. Mom. That sounds scary. Oh yeah, I had an excruciating pregnancy with Matt, acid reflux, vomiting into my throat every day. Oh and that kicking, I thought Pele was in there for sure. When they finally yanked him out with the forceps, I cried hallelujah. Hey. Hey. Hey. I gotta go. I gotta go. Okay, I'll see ya, see ya at home. Love you. So, what do you think about Lori? Lori? I think she's lying. Based on what? You heard her. She came in here, she complimented you. Yeah, she said I lost weight. There you go. I did lose a few pounds. Hm. I walk in and you stop talking? What is it? You heard Lori, okay? She was visiting a friend. Yeah, we heard that. Mmhmm Look, just don't start anything, okay? I'm telling you. You're telling me? Okay. Look, just, I'm warning you, okay? Mmhmm. Sweetie, she won't start anything. - Okay. - Mmhmm. Jess, this woman was in earlier going psycho about her bill and now she brought in her boyfriend. Can you just go talk to em? Yeah. What? You're the mechanic? Yeah, what about it? What about it? 2100 for a clutch job? Oh, I take it you know about clutches? I know when I'm getting hosed. Question, when your clutch wouldn't engage, why did your girlfriend keep ramming it in? She didn't keep ramming it in. Her flywheel tells a different story. Okay look, I'm gonna make it simple for you. Oh please. I'm not paying this amount. How much should it cost? How much should it cost? How much should it cost? 1100. And it would except we couldn't machine it cause your girlfriend ground the fuck out of it so we had to replace it, another 1000, 2100. I'm not doing this. Fine. I'm in awe. They're not budging. What do you mean they're not budging? They're not budging. They say you rammed in the clutch. What do you mean... You rammed it in. They had to do, I don't know. I need my car. You said you would fix it Oh we don't take debit. Hustle. I'm coming, I'm coming. God, look at this place. Looks okay. If I had to live here, I'd kill myself. That's sort of the idea. Need to pee. I have a bad feeling about this. This better not be about you. Me, why would it be about me? It's overkill, don't you think? No I don't think. Uh, can I help you ladies? Oh hi, do you know Mrs. Nidem? Hi, I'm John. Hi John, I'm Marianne. Ah. Are you the warden around here? No, I just live here. Oh, oh. Are you moving here? No. Do you know where Barbara Nidem is? Barbara, oh yeah, she's in the lounge. Can I show you? No. He thinks I'm moving in here? Mrs. Nidem? Mrs. Nidem, hi, how are you? Hello, yes, yes. Hi there, I'm Marianne. This is my daughter Jessica. It's so nice to see you here. They said you'd be here and here you are. We're just checking up on you, see how you're doing. How I'm doing? Yeah what with Lori and Alexis being friends, such good friends, such old friends. Oh, Alexis, yes, yeah. It can't be easy living here, but it must be nice having Alexis around, hey? Alexis? Well I haven't seen her for years. I don't know, maybe she's not home. That's her bike right there. Okay, but this requires tact, so let me do the talking. Yeah, just don't go on and on. ♪ I've been ♪ Thinking ♪ On two ♪ And I've been drinking ♪ As I do ♪ I was lying - Lori. - Hey Lori. Um hi, hi, do you have a minute? Yeah of course, come on in. First of all, let me start off by saying, Lori, that we like having you in our family. We think you and Matt make a great couple, a stable couple and we think that stability comes from two people We know, okay? What? Matt saw you in that motel room so you can drop the act. We're not judging. We just want you to stop before it's too late. I don't know what you guys are talking about. We know it wasn't Alexis in the motel room. And how's that? We checked in on Alexis' mom. You tracked down Alexis' mother? Yes and she hasn't seen her daughter in years. Yeah um maybe that's because she has Alzheimer's. Oh. Oh. Seriously! Sorry about that. Alexis has been to visit her mother every single day, but she doesn't recognize her. That's um... What is it with you people? Like what is your fucking damage? Swear to god. We should go. Yeah. That's um, that's too bad about Alexis' mother... Just go. Okay. Just go. Hey babe. Babe, I got this new I.D. card at school. I think I look pretty good. Who says a semiotics professor can't be a handsome devil? What? Look Matt, you have to choose between me or your family because I just can't do both. My family, what did they do? What did they do? Jess! Sweetie, she's in her workroom I think. I told you, I told you not to start something. What do you do? I like you upset. You interrogate an 80 year old with Alzheimer's? You should show this side to your wife. Why would you do that, why? Why would we do that? Why do you think? I don't know. Maybe it's because you have mental breakdowns. Okay, okay, what is going on? Matt's losing his shit. About what? Mom, you go over to our house and you accuse Lori? Oh yes, that, uh well, your motel incident got us worried. Motel incident? - Yes. - Nothing happened. Nothing happened, nothing happened, she was visiting her friend. Just be thankful we had your back. Oh thank you, thank you so much. Look, do you want some advice when dealing with Lori? Advice from you? When was your last relationship, the 90's? What was that? You start drama because you got nothing going on in your life. What did you say to me? Just because you don't have a relationship, don't sabotage mine. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Matt. Matt. What? Where is Lori now? She's at home. What's she doing? I don't know, packing or something. You left her when she was packing or something? Go. What are you doing? Uh just finishing this. Gimme that. Don't, ah, No texting Lori. Jesus Christ. Communication makes you look so weak. Oh, communication? I have a masters in communication. You have a masters in shit. This is really pathetic. She leaves me a note? What am I supposed to do? Wait it out. Wait it out. Yeah you wait it out and then when the time's right, you man up. That's what she wants. Oh and you know what she wants? Okay. You know, Lori's easy man, she wants what she's always wanted. Attention. But she won't give me her attention. She won't even tell me where she's staying. I know where she's staying. She's at her best friend's. Where else would she be? Here antelopes seek refuge and nourishment by a watering hole. And yet, eyes are on them. They are being stalked, hunted. In an instant, it's over. That antelope never even saw it coming. They always get them when they're by the water. You'd think they'd learn. Where are you going? Out. Out where? To a bar. What for? What do you think? Oh you're not reacting to what Matt said, are you? No, I can't even remember what Matt said. You know, that thing he said about you being single for so long. No, and anyway, Jay and I broke up in '02 so 90's, yeah right. Well I'm glad you're going out. You should go out. You should have lots of boyfriends, an attractive woman like you. Yeah, yeah listen, do you want to come with me? All my friends bailed. Which friends? This place is dead. It's not so bad. Let's go. Why don't you go sit at the bar? What me sit at the bar? Yeah I think the two of us are sending out the wrong vibe. What vibe? Like we're some kind of package deal. You know, divide and conquer? Go sit at the bar and buddy up. Buddy up. What do you think I'm gonna do? Just don't be confrontational. I'm not confrontational, I'm picky. Hi. Hello there. Hi. Hi. Oh, yeah, don't let that fool ya. Since my wife and I separated, I've actually been retaining water and I literally can't get the damn thing off. Uh, so I've been looking around and you know, you're around my age. Okay, you're done. ♪ Hold back and bite my tongue ♪ Cause I know you're the one Brett. Wow, you look great, really great. It's not often someone as good looking as you sits on that stool. I come here all the time. I mean, I don't come here all the time. I'm not an alcoholic or anything. I just chat up the ladies when I sit at the bar... Hey Brett. Hey. Is anyone sitting here? Not you. Excuse me, mind if I join you? The seat is free. Thank you. Hey. Hi. Hi. I'm Jim. Hi Jim, I'm Marianne. Hi, Marianne, nice name. Thank you. Hey. You look just like my ex-wife. This is so weird. What are the odds of that? Have I seen you in here before? No, I've never been here in my life before. Oh. Yeah it's kind of exciting. Yeah, welcome. First time in a bar. I mean, not my first time, but my first time in, you know, a long time. I came here with my daughter. Yeah, Jessica. Yeah, I have a son too, Matt, but he's not here. He's, he's just not here. Oh. There you are. It's just my phone. Right. Right. Me, oh I'm Hungarian. Oh dear, this is my daughter I was just telling you about. Ah, hello, beautiful. Yes I know. She has my eyes. Can I talk to you? Now? Mmhmm. Oh, um, excuse me. I'll just be one minute, all right? Get your purse, we're going. Now, I'm getting some heat. Oh fine. You want to spend the night with Santa? Fine. Jessica. Everything okay? Oh yeah, she's just plugging the meter. That's Lori's bike. Bit of a party in there tonight. You're kidding me. Well there's people in the window. Wanna get outta here? Why would I wanna get outta here? Cause you probably want to get her alone, right? Right. Party's not the best time. Yeah, yeah. You want me to go in there and check it out? Yeah, yeah, do. I'll go check it out. Dude, don't let her see you. I won't. I can fucking see you. What are you doing here, Matt? What are you, are you partying tonight? Feel like celebrating? Just don't, okay? Stop. Don't what? God, just, why are you here? I thought my note was perfectly clear. Oh, you thought your, I need some time note was clear? There it is. There it is right there. You're just so fucking frustrating. I'm frustrating? You're the queen of frustration. Living with you and your moods and your anxieties... Your moods are better? You're utterly rutterless. I never know what I'm going to get. Just listen to yourself, like listen to yourself. When was the last time you looked at me. Looked at you in what context? In what context? God even your language wears me down. Just stop it! Would you just tell me, are you seeing someone else? Fuck off. What do you think, Matt? Well I don't know after four years of marriage, I get a note. You're, you're right, um, I really should have said this to your face. Goodbye, Matt. Go home. I don't get it. What'd I do to deserve this? It's out of the blue. I'm sure it wasn't out of the blue. What was that? You don't pick up the signs, I'm just saying. Oh. Would you like a semiotic breakdown of the signs? Look, do you want to know what happened? Oh, you know what happened? Yeah, yeah, why don't you tell me what happened. Lori gave you the signs. You just didn't read them cause that's what women do. I'm going to bed. Dude, you want to stick me with one beer? No, I'm going to bed. I went to a bar tonight for the first time in like 10 years. How was that? Punishing. My mother got more action than I did. Where is your mother? She's out with some dude right now. Hey, are you still with uh, that Cat chick? No, we split. I'm a free agent. But Cat, she's very complicated. Hey, I have an idea, let's do shots. Okay. Cheers. What are you doing? What, you're saying you never thought about it? What? No, this is, my best friend's upstairs. Yes, depressed, medicated, he won't be joining us. Look at you, come on. What, you're like a little cat. Um, no, it's just weird. You're like my sister. That's what I'm saying. It's hot, right? Oh gosh you have a meaty man thigh. I'm not very comfortable with this and you seem very... I seem what? You seem horny and you're very warm right now and I'm a little uncomfortable. Can you just sit over there for a minute? Okay. You want to drink more? Yes I do. Where are you taking me? Just a little tour. Is this some kind of dungeon or something? No, no, no, no. You know, I'm not into any S and M stuff, right? Okay. Come in, come in. At least not on the first date. Gotcha. Holy moly, look at this place. Boy you've got a lot of instruments. Mmhmm. Hum de dum.

Maybe because he's been depressed for two months. Just a guess. I mean what can she gain from meeting us? She asked us to come in, okay? Yes, but why, what for, what for? We're here so let's just do this. Well either way, I'm not talking. Good. I'm definitely not talking about myself, blubber all my feelings, as if. She's not some psychotherapist. So what is she? She's a therapist therapist, I don't know, she's something. Oh she's something. That's encouraging. Jessica. Well either way, I don't have an opinion. Great. What Matt doesn't need is some therapist confirming his weaknesses. You don't have an opinion, huh? As if I'd ever trust a therapist. Here, have a rock. What am I supposed to do with this? You're supposed to rub it, soothes anxiety. Okay let's switch gears. I'd like to invite your mom and your sister... You knew. Didn't you? The day I said goodbye to you, that I said I didn't need you, you knew I'd be back, didn't you? Well we can definitely get back to that, but today I want to stick to our schedule. I wanna invite your mom and your sister. Matt, we talked about this... Yeah, I can't watch that show, not today. Hi sweetie. Hey. How'd it go? Good. Hi Marianne and Jessica. I'm ready for you. Oh, okay. Don't hijack this meeting. Let her do the talking, okay? Yeah, yeah. Have a seat wherever you like. How are you today? Oh, very good. I like this blue blanket. It's nice. Yes. Find parking okay? Oh yes, I found a spot just outside there. Oh good. Expensive, it was $6 an hour. I didn't have enough change so I had to use that app, that parking, what's the name of that app? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I use that. It's very convenient. Well, I would like to thank you both for coming here today. Clearly you're here about Matt. Mmhmm. I have been very concerned about him. So I have done a risk assessment. What, he said he was going to kill himself? Is that why we're here? Don't be silly. Yes, that is why you're here. Oh my god. He wouldn't do that to us, mom. Well actually, Jessica, it's not something he would do to you. Suicide is rarely about other people. It is about wanting to stop the pain. I get that, but Matt's going through a hard time right now. His marriage is falling apart. Mmhmm, but I don't think it's purely situational. Based on what? Based on the risk assessment. His feeling of hopelessness has escalated. Yeah, but since he was like four, Matt's been on Louvox and listening to Radiohead. Yeah, I know that, but he's more vulnerable now. So you're saying we're not a close family, is that what you're saying? No, that's not what I'm saying. That's not what she's saying, Jess. But you're saying we wouldn't look out for him? What I'm saying is, at this point you need to come together to support him. Oh so this is like a head's up. In a sense, yeah. Oh good, well I'm out. Do not leave this room. Mm. Do, excuse me for a second. Of course. What was that, what was that? What did I just say, huh? Mom, what are you doing? I'm changing it up. That thing has been swarmed by bush ticks. Oh, the feeder. Mmhmm. Trying something new. Suet. What is suet? Well, it's birdseed, cornmeal and a bit of peanut butter and lard. It's disgusting, but the birds seem to like it. But in the summer, if it gets rancid. Oh it's just disgusting. Have you been drinking? Yes mom, I've been drinking. No, I'm pregnant. Um, um, so I don't want to pry or anything, but um, whose is it? Oh mom, I, that's not the conversation I'm trying to have right now. I just... It's just you've been spending so much time with Sean and you're separated and... Yeah, I'm not, I don't, no, I can't talk about that. Okay. Well, what about your, your singing and all that? What about it? You won't be able to focus on your career in the same way and... I'm not really sure what you're getting at. Okay, sweetie, maybe maybe you just want to sit this one out. Okay, obviously it's your decision and I support you either way. I thought you'd be excited for a grand kid. Well I am, it's just, honey, I've already got three. Have you seen my purse any, oh there it is. Where are you going? Taking Matt to the therapist and hooking up with Jim. Oh, how are things going with Jim anyway? Oh, he's fine. Sex is great, but his opinions I could live without. You know those people who don't listen. They just think about what they're gonna say next? No, no. - Hm? - Nothing. Okay, come on. Take the egg with us. Hi there, I'd like to pick up my car, Mr. Dufass. Oh yeah, it'll be ready tomorrow. What, what are you talking about? Had to order a part. You had, well what part? Vent solenoid. What? I don't know, they called you about it. Well look, look, look, look, I got a big night, I have a big date and I can't go and pick her up in a courtesy car. We don't have courtesy cars. You don't have a courtesy car? You're killing me here. Can we please, please, please talk to the mechanic, work through this, get creative, whatever. Okay. Thank you. All right. Jess in there? Yeah. Hey. Oh hey. What'd you get up to last night? Oh nothing much, two beers, watched the Chevchenko fight. Oh, I love him. Her, Valentina Chevchenko. Yeah, that's what I meant. - Oh yeah, you like UFC? - Oh yeah. It's like my favorite. I'm a huge fan. Who's your favorite fighter? The one you said. Chevchenko. Yeah. Cool. This is a lot of rubber. Yup. Good news. Talked to the mechanic. You can pick your car up tomorrow. Fuck me. Hello? Hi. Hey. How are you? Oh god, you don't even want to know. Look, Sean, I'm sorry, I'm just so upset right now, I can't even think straight. I'm just... What happened? Ug, my mom, she... Cancer? No, Sean, um, I'm pregnant. Oh. Yeah anyway, so I, you know, I tell her the news and you're not gonna believe this, she she says maybe you should sit this one out. Like what does that even mean? See it's from hockey, sit the shift out, play bad. Yeah, am I crazy? Is that like, like insane for a mother to say to her daughter? She's kind of got a point though, right? Are you serious? Well, if you don't take care of it sooner than later, you gotta do a DNC which on the fun scale's like, one. I gotta go, Lori, I'm sorry. You should talk to Matt. You okay? I don't know. Thinking about my son, he's fighting depression. But he's a professor. Yeah, so? So at least he's got coverage. What's that got to do with anything? My kids are fucking up without coverage. Please, I don't want to talk about coverage or your kids for that matter. That's my point. You're kids, my kids, they're adults, Marianne. There's not a lot we can do. That's a lazy man's answer. There's always something you can do. If you ask me... I'm not asking you. We've made things too comfortable for our kids. In case you haven't noticed... My kids moved home, like it's no big deal, after flopping out of this or that. I mean kids today, they're okay with failure, with weakness. Oh now you're saying my son is weak for moving back home. No, I'm saying you're weak for letting him. What, what, what? Come on, what'd I say? You know what, Jim? Shit. My brother was right. Don't date Hungarians. Oh that's for employ... Employees only. What? Well what the fuck? What the fuck, Sean? Oh I know. I get it. Do you? I gotta go cause my truck is running, I'm parked... You're a fucking asshole. I know. You're a fucking asshole. You're an asshole. Hi, okay listen, I need you to come, all right? I need to talk to you right now, yeah? Hey Megan. How's it going? Good. Jess in there? Yeah. Okay. What? What? It was Sean. What? It was Sean in the motel room with Lori. Thank god. Thank god? I just said it was Sean. Yeah, but sex doesn't mean anything to Sean. He'll screw anything with a mouth. So what, we're just gonna tell Matt his best friend's been fucking his wife? Of course we're not gonna tell him that. It would tip him right over the edge. And there's more because the hits just keep on coming. I have perfect news. What? Oh fuck. Come, come, come in. My mom's upstairs, okay? Just go over there. Is it true? Matt, what are you doing here? You look so beautiful right now. Thanks, I uh, listen, um... I wanna say some things. Okay, I know that we're like, whatever, okay, but I will be there for you. I wanna have this baby with you. And I'll get you anything you need, okay? Like classes and vitamins and folic acid. Actually, I found out that if you have too much folic acid, it could lead to autism. It's not yours. What? I don't know what else to say. It's um, How can you be so sure? Well, if it was yours, I would be having a difficult pregnancy A difficult, what? I would be able to feel the baby's anxiety, neediness and I don't. I feel really good. Look, I know this is hard, I get that.

Uh no, he left a couple of hours ago. Okay, just come in. Where is he? Where is Matt? You people again. You people, that's nice. You lied about everything fucking imaginable from fucking your husband's best friend to using Alzheimer's to cover your fucking tracks! I don't like that tone. Fine, what happened, where is he? We don't know. Did he give you any idea where he was going? No. Well what happened, Lori? What did you say? Calm down. Answer the question! I don't need to answer you. Okay, we have a little bit of a situation here, but the fact is, Lori, you're having a baby. Not his. - Oh. - Fuck you! Stop it, stop it! We have to think about Matt, stop it! Stop it! Unknown caller. Yes? Who is it? Hello? Yes? Yes, this is... Who is it? This is Marianne Horvat. I'm sorry? Could you repeat that please? Hello? It's a fucking telemarketer. Well I didn't know, did I? Come, let's get you out of these things. There we go. Matt? Matt, what did you do? That's it, that's it, oh. Okay there we go. Now what did you do? I need to talk to you. Ah, it's so difficult when you are wet. I need to talk to you, right now. Jessica,. Come on, let's get you in the shower. Socks. Matt? Do you need anything? I'm okay. Good, good. Get warm. Yeah, okay. Thanks mom. Mom, we need to take him in. Jessica, I'm not having this conversation again. We are not taking him in. You do a lap through the psych ward. You try something like that. He needs professional help. Well you sure flip flopped. First you shit on professional help and then that's what he needs. Mom. Jessica, there are some things you just don't talk about. This is top of that list. He needs to get checked out. Oh and you just decided that. No, he decided. - Okay. - He decided. He had a moment, but he came back. That is not good enough. Hey sweetie, come on in. Let's get you by the fire, come on. There you go. Can I talk to you? Either you take him in or I will. Either way, he's going. Go. Do it. Matt, Mom. Sweetie, we gotta take you in, get you checked out. I know. I'll go. I want to. Oh dear, look at your face. What? What? I just, I still don't feel right about this. I don't feel right about it. I don't understand you. You wanted him to go in, he said he'll go in. He said he's fine with it. Well that's just it, now he's fine with it sitting by the fire. We've done everything for him and an hour ago he was gonna do that to us. But he didn't. He didn't. Hallelujah. Jessica. Come on in, have a seat. How are you? Don't ask me that. I'm not here to talk about my feelings, okay? Okay. Why are you here? Uh, I have no idea. My mother suggested it. Hm, but you don't have to be here. What do you and Matt talk about? Well I can't tell you that. He tried to kill himself and you can't tell me? I'm his sister. We can talk about your feelings. We can talk about you. My feelings. I don't believe in therapy, okay? Okay, well, what do you do for a living? Me, I'm a car mechanic. I work at Grandview Tire. Really, do you like it? Do I like it? Uh, I could do it in my sleep. I so need a change. What's preventing you from making a change? Um, what's preventing me? Um, I don't know. Why are you here? Matt doing what he did. Matt's okay now. He's been assessed and we no longer feel that he is a threat to himself. All right, but why would he do that to me, to my mom? To stop the pain. To stop the pain, is that gonna be your answer for everything? No, for this. But he would do that to me, to my mom? What the fuck? But it's not about you, Jessica. Right, again with that, but there's only the three of us. You don't think that we would be destroyed picking up the pieces from that? No, I think you would be devastated. It is devastating to lose a family member to suicide. But you grieve and in time, you get over it. Oh fuck this. Fuck you. I'm sorry about that. It's okay. My head's kind of all over the place. I guess um, I guess I'm here because... I feel angry. I feel pissed. I feel like I have these thoughts in my head and they just click over and over and over again and I can't, I don't have any control of them. What thoughts, can you describe them? Well after Matt did the thing, I felt flooded with rage. I was so angry. Go on. I felt like, you know, fuck you. You would do that to us like after, after everything, after all the support, after everything, after everything we've done for you, after trying to get you out of every jam you're in and after, that you would fucking do that to us. I feel used. I feel fucking betrayed. And my mother, she's like, she's fine. She feels relieved. She's going along like, and Matt's going along like nothing happened too so you know, the whole thing, it's fucking weird and I, I, I, I, feel so angry and I, I can't sleep and I can't eat and I'm distracted at my work and I just, Am I a bad person for thinking that? Am I a bad sister for having those thoughts? No, not at all. All the family members, loved ones, who have been through what you have been through, they feel the same thing. You know Matt doing what he did, it just fucked me up. It just tears everything. It tips everything over. Of course, it is so understandable what you are feeling. I feel so alone. Look at me, I'm blubbering like a fucking idiot. Here. Thank you. This was actually really awesome. Can I come back again next week? Of course. Hey Jess. Oh, hey. You okay? Am I okay? Yeah you just seem kind of down or distracted. Now you're in a car. I am down. About what? Sorry, no it's none of my business. It's personal. No, it's okay. You know, I'm just dealing with some, anyway, I'm seeing someone. Wow, great. Is it that tall guy that came in here, with the dark hair, tall guy? No, oh no, no, I'm, no, I'm seeing a therapist. That's great. That's great? God, I hate this place. Yeah, it's so, Okay, I just can't. Thank god you're here. Um, you wanna go for drinks tonight? Drinks? Uh... No, you know what, don't... No, it uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Cool. Cool. Okay. Okay. You want a drink? Uh... Yeah sure, yeah. Oh. Thanks. It's all right. Don't uh, don't go to any trouble. Mm mm, no trouble. Cheers. Thank you. Can I take your jacket? Yeah, sure. Have a seat. Oh, sorry. I like your place. It's really like nick nacky. Hey oh, you know, I'm sorry, let's not. It's not happening. What? It's not working for me, okay? Oh no, it's working. Maybe that's what you're scared of, right? No scared, I'm not scared, okay? I'm not scared. It's not that. Then what? Okay, I used to work at this other shop and I got involved with a mechanic and things went south or sideways or whatever and then either way, it got impossible. Impossible? Look I wasn't one of the guys anymore so they all hit on me or they treated me like I was a slut and I just don't want any part of that. Is this one of those like don't shit where you eat stories? Yeah, I guess so, yeah. Well I'm leaving at the end of the month. Oh yeah? I quit. Who's she with? Who's with what who? Lori, mom. She said it's not mine, so who is it? I'm sorry? Mom, who's she with? Okay, fine, you need to know. I understand that. I was the same with Jim. I wanted to know about Jim and I found out, boy did I ever. This one time I got to his place, the last one was leaving and I thought, my god, where does he get the stamina? And it wasn't just the tub of no-name Cialis he kept by the bed, no, he really knew what he was doing. He did this one thing with his finger... It was Sean, okay? It was Sean. You're joking. No. Really? Really Miss I have to tell the truth at all costs? You heard Sara, she did an assessment. He's fine. Oh, oh, a couple of therapy sessions, suddenly you're the expert. You do know that he tried to commit suicide, don't you? I'm right here. Right. Hi. Hi guys. Oh hi, hi sweetie. Hi, come on in, come on in. Hi, come in, come in. Oh hi honey, how are you? Got a kiss for me, got a kiss for me? Grandma's got some food for you. You just missed Lori. She's rehearsing. Rehearsing, rehearsing what? Well she's giving a show tomorrow night. Lori's giving a show? Mmhmm. She's gonna strut and grunt her stuff seven months pregnant? Apparently. Do you want a little? Look, I love her, you know I do, but nobody wants to see that and Lori is a me person. Yeah, she is. And that doesn't work with kids. They need your undivided attention. Yeah, they do. Well how is she anyway? The baby's moving around a lot and it really bugs her. I'm sure it's nothing. Well she complains a lot about it. Oh yeah her, I'm fine, I'm fine routine while she's writhing around on the floor.

Honestly, but I gave you what you needed. You gave me what I needed? If it wasn't for me, there'd be someone else and then who knows, right? But it wasn't, Sean, it was you. It was you. That's exactly what I'm saying. Just think about this, it's there for you because of me, right? It's all laid out. It's all laid out. Lori's living at her mom's. She's broke. You can't lay it out any better than that. Go. You have to leave. Right now. Bye Sean. Bye Marianne. Good to see you. Goodbye. Come by again. Get, Jesus. So, how are you? How am I? I'm definitely not very fucking good. Hey, language. We have talked about this. For god sakes, Leanne, you asked me a fucking question, I gave you the answer. I'm not in the mood for this shit. I'm sorry. This, this, this baby thing is so not my cup of tea. Tell me about it. Oh man, it's just like can't eat, can't sleep, I'm flipping out. It's your first baby. It's okay to have nerves. I don't think it's nerves. I don't like, no, no that's, that's, that's not it. It's not nerves. Okay. Well it's like I don't know, it's always punching me and kicking me if it's like hungry or wants attention. It's just like this incessant anxiety and neediness. What? Oh I am such a fucking idiot. I tell you things, why can't you tell me things? What, where's this headed? What was Megan doing here? She just stopped by to pick up a thumb drive. Oh, is that after you kissed her? Yes, okay, so, so what? So nothing, so loop me in. I'm dying to know. Confide in me once in a while. Well not everything, just the details. You know, I didn't tell you because I thought that you would be upset. Upset, why? You know, no chance of procreation and I know you're in to that, so. Oh honey, I gave up on you years ago. I'll get it. What do you want? I want to talk to Matt. About what? Just, can you just get him for me please? No, about fucking what? Look, I miss him and I just, goddammit, Jess! What are you doing? What? Let her in. Why should I? He's better off married. What, to that snaky bitch? I suppose you enjoy watching him drag his broody ass around here. Let her, let her in, let her in! Oh hi. Hey Lori, come in, come in. I'm happy to see you. It's nice to see you. Oh, give us a hug. Yeah, it's a lot. Wow. Well hello in there. Let me take your coat. Oh thanks. What do you want? Lori's here. She is, what, where? Downstairs. Like downstairs, downstairs? Her bike! What does she want? She wants you. She does? Can I just say something? Look, can you stop that? Can I just say something? What? Make her work for it. Make her work for it? She lied to you, she cheated on you. She'll do it again if you don't play this right. If you really want her back, she needs to hear three little words from you. Right, lead with that. No, dumb ass, not those three words. Right. Hey. Hey. I had to see you. Why? Maybe I fucked up. I really fucked up. I made a huge mistake. Yeah, I know. I'm here because I'm sorry. And I, I want to make it right. What changed your mind? You did. Your kid kicked in, like literally is kicking me right now. It's yours, I mean it's ours, it's... It's too late, Lori. It's too late. No, it's not. Please don't do this. You should leave before Jess sees you. Sure, okay. Jessica. Jessica, turn that off! What? What did you do? What did I do? Nothing. Lori's gone, Matt's in the fetal position, obviously something has happened. What did you do? Nothing. I don't get it. It really seemed like Lori wanted to put it back. You know, if I did do something, I had Matt's best interest in mind, okay? What like you haven't played a guy to get him back? Don't pull, don't pull. Carol, hi, Carol. Hey, how's it, oh, no don't do that. We have- - Marianne, Marianne, I got nothing to say to you. I don't want to talk to you. You don't have to talk, just listen, okay? Let me start by saying how sorry I am about last time the way it played out. Obviously Jess choking Lori didn't go as planned. I think it was just one of those escalating things that in the end, doesn't represent the true feelings of the... Marianne, Marianne... Okay. We both want the same thing. Why not be on the same page? As if I want Lori living in my house raising a kid, but what about Matt and his mental health? Mental health? No, no, he has turned a corner. He is awesome. He is just awesome. Awesome? Yeah. I have a friend who's a nurse at VGH. I know Matt was in the psych ward. Yeah, but not the psych ward, psych ward, not Olivia D'Haveland in the snake pit or Cuckoo's Nest or anything like that. Look, honestly, I don't see Matt and Lori have a future. Oh no. They have a future. I'm going to make sure of that. What, you're threatening me? No, I would never threaten you, no, I'm just saying, Matt is the father. Okay look, I don't want to be blunt, but... You don't believe me. Ask Lori, ask her. She came over this afternoon to get back together with Matt. She did? Yep. And that's why Matt and I are here. Matt's here? Yeah. He's in the car, right there. - Oh, okay. - See? Wave. Okay, okay, okay, look, I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna talk to Lori. You guys wait out here and if she wants to talk, I'll give you a sign. Okay, come on, Nick. Okay, hi. Okay, so it's set. We're waiting til she gives us a sign. She's gonna give us the thumbs up. Did you go over to Matt's this afternoon to get back together with him? What if I did? Did you? Yes. Okay, apparently, Matt got bad advice from Jess. What else is new? Matt and Marianne are parked out front right now. Really? God. Honestly, if I were you, I would keep my options open. Look, he's just sitting there. Where have I seen that before? Don't you think you should talk to him? No, I'm done talking to him. Hi Carol. Yes, what's up? I don't know, Carol. I didn't think this afternoon went that well to be honest. Oh yeah, what makes you think that? Hey, I just got off the phone with Carol and she thought it would be a really good idea if you and I went to Lori's show. No, we're not going. Okay, but Carol said that Lori said... Mom. Suit yourself. Mom? Hey. Hey. Where's mom? At Lori's concert. Oh, is that all you have to say to me? You set me up. I didn't set you up. You set you up, you set you up. Oh really, how's that? Matt, I'm not fucking doing this. You sabotaged my one chance to get back together with Lori. That is bullshit. And then you steal my therapist. I didn't steal your therapist. We don't even talk about you, okay? We talk about me, me, which I fucking love. You always do this to me. You always fucking do this to me. Christ, Matt. I'm not fucking doing this. If you want Lori back, go fucking get her or don't, or whatever, but leave me the fuck out of it. Oh. Is Matt coming? I don't know, I told him. It hasn't started yet, huh? Of course not.
