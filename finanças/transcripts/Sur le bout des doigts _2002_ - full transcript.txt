Julie. Julie… Can you hear me? I'm sure you can hear me. Julie. It's Mom. Who will always be here. Do you want me to start over? No, I'm almost done. So… There are no mistakes. Oh, yes, there are. At the end. Why did you write triplets? You were playing triplets. No, I wasn't. Yes, you were. The notes were the same length. No, don't make excuses. I played them the right way. Okay… I made the mistake, then. - Hello. - Hello. Sit down. Mom will be right out. Is it true you stay home all day? Who said that? My mom did. Why don't you go to school? Hello, Charlotte! Have you worked this time? A little… not too much. Julie, finish the transcription. You'll play it for me later. How does Julie play like that? Let's start. INTERI MOTHER - RAGGED MOTHER GRANDMOTHER - MOTHERAZADE Hello! Ah, hello, Julie! Not working this morning? Oh, no, I'm going to bed this morning. You work at night? I watch the stars. That must be nice! A dream job. What's the real one? The real one is not the Milky Way. Are you going to play the piano today? I'll keep you awake. Can you hear the piano from your house? Sometimes. When you strike the keys hard. I can hear your music when I go to bed too. It's not the music you play, is it? Good night, then. - Goodbye, ma'am. - Goodbye, Charlotte. Don't forget to tell your sister to come tomorrow at six. Are you finished? Almost. What are you playing? It's the trio for tomorrow's concert. Do you play violin? Go sit on the balcony. I'm going to the bathroom. Just a minute. And at seven, go to your father's place. I'll pick you up after. Hello, Juliette. Hello, Mr. Director. They're already here. Yes, I drove them to their hotel. Are you rehearsing now? Yes, well, at 6:30, but I can already hear the piano. I'll come by later. Julie, what are you doing? I told you to go up to the balcony. Hurry up, please. The musicians are coming. And at seven, go to your father's place. - Hello. - Hello. Daniel Sonnier. I'm the trio's pianist. Juliette Chevalier. I'll turn your pages. Was it you I heard playing? Yes. You play very well. I stopped on the stairs to listen to you. Do you give concerts? - Hello. - Hello. Start from the beginning, please. Why did you bring out a Bordeaux? What, you want to pick the wine now? I prefer Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It's round and full-bodied. Here, taste this. 80% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Can you tell me what you think? Dense, chewy, open. Very appealing, I would say. You do pretty well. When you were little, I recited the "grands crus" to you because I didn't know what else to say to you. You've already told me. Well, at least I've taught you that. So, what's going on with you? Like what? Everything. Your piano, and the rest. Piano couldn't be better. - Is that what your mother says? - No, it's what I'm saying. And what does she say? Mom? She doesn't say anything. She lets me play. That's all good if you succeed. You don't like the piano, Dad? Why would you say that? No, I'm proud when you play. I just wish you could study with other kids like you. With other teachers, too. Want me to help you? No, it's okay. I'll just be a couple minutes. I can't even explain it to myself. About what? Everything. - Can we take a break? - Yes, if you want. Would you like a drink? Coffee would be nice. - Nothing, thanks. - I'll come with you. I'll see how the piano sounds in the hall. Would you play some? One more time. A little more, though. I don't like to play in front of others. That's not true. I heard you earlier. I can give you the name of an agent. You can send a tape. It's a little late for me. Sometimes, it doesn't take much. Of course. You don't want to talk about it? I do. But there's nothing really original about my story. I spent my entire childhood at the piano. With my mother. I never did anything else. My mother was a pianist, too. She made me work every day, from morning till night. I never had any other teacher. And after that? After that, nothing happened. I forgot about it. You don't want to come up a minute? No, it's late. She's coming. See you Sunday. - Are you tired? - Yes. I drank too much. I didn't like that pianist earlier. You didn't? What didn't you like about him? He played like he had a metronome in his fingers. Not very interesting. You don't think so, Mom? And me, what do you think of how I play? You? You're the best pianist in the world. Are you okay, Mom? Of course. - Julie! - Mom? What's wrong? The piano scared me. The piano? I don't know what came over me. Julie? Julie, wake up. Get up. Julie, get up. We're going to have a little concert. You want a glass of milk? Now? Come on, I'll wait for you downstairs. What do you want me to play? Drink your glass of milk first. What are you doing with that microphone? I'm recording you. I used to do it for you when you were little. I used to bring a tape for you every day. What do you want me to play? Whatever you want. Okay, let's go. You better be perfect. You got a train to catch? Why are you going so fast? No, I'm not. Yes, you are. You want to show what you can do with your fingers. I'm playing for you, Mom. Julie. Why did you say that? HAD TO GIVE SOME INSTRUCTIONS, SORRY What are you doing? Ah, Julie! Oh, nothing, just tinkering. I'm just having fun. You do that from time to time, right? What do you mean? Just fooling around. You don't dream? I do, but not today. Something wrong today? I didn't play very well earlier. You can play anything on your piano. Hello, Julie, honey. Can you come help me? Still at the piano? Can't do anything else? It's not the right time. Piano all day. Well, then! I won't be here long. - Your mother's not here? - No. - She's out shopping. - Here. Put this in a safe place. Ah, is there any white wine in this house? I don't think so. What's your father doing? A house without wine is like a woman without a man. Men! I'll introduce you to some boys. You'll see. Hello! - Can I help you? - No, thank you. I'm fine. Hi, Mom. Hello, Juliette. Hi, sweetheart. I'm late this morning. - You look great. - I am. I'm going on vacation in two weeks. If you want, I can take her with me. No, she has to work here. When she discovers a boy's willy, she'll be scared, poor thing. Are you going by yourself? For the moment, I am alone, yes. It's a little depressing, actually. I don't know how you do it. Could you stay with Julie tonight at the house? What's going on with you? Do you remember that I exist? Julie, come eat, please. - Oh, no, not before lunch! - Just one. Come and eat. You know, tonight, Jo will stay with you. - Because after the concert I have to… - But I'm going to your concert. You told me yesterday the pianist was bad. So? I want to go there to see you on stage. Listen, my little darlings, I'll do what you want, but I'm not going to a classical concert. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. I listened to your recording this afternoon. You have real personality when you play. I'm not saying that to be polite or to flatter you. I mean it. You really should continue. - Have a good evening. - Have a good evening. Shall we go? Would you like to have dinner with us? No, I can't. I have to go home. I just wanted to ask you for the tape back. But I don't have it here. Can you send it to me? - Of course. - I have to get it back. I'll leave you my address. You took the trouble to record it and bring it to me. Yes, but I don't want you to keep it. You're the one who gave it to me. Julie? Julie? Julie. A little humor, girl. Come on, relax with us. Come on! Juliette. It breaks your heart… It breaks your heart to see her having fun and laughing with me? Go to bed. I'll take care of Julie. No one else, especially not you. I don't like what you're doing to your daughter. With all the ideas you have in your head. What am I doing to her? You don't see how she's playing? Julie's very happy. I am happy with my daughter. Wonderful. Do you want me to take the inventory? It'll be quick. Failure everywhere. Everywhere. Couldn't even carry a child for nine months. Julie is me. Okay. Juliette… Mom? What's going on? Nothing. Are you sure this is the place? Yes, 15 Rue de la Mariée. I don't see the bride. But it's 15. It's strange. The house doesn't match the piano. It doesn't? And you match your wife? Whoa there, Dédé. Okay? Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - Piano delivery. - This is the right place? - Yes. Hello. Can we take a look inside? Yes, of course. Don't stay there. You never know. Are you due soon? In three months. Juliette! Wait! - Let's take the little one out first. - Okay. Let us take care of everything. Okay, all good. Watch out. - Juliette? - Is this okay for you? What's going on? - Okay. - It's the new piano. New piano? No! The keys toward the light, please. Yes, but we'll turn it after. You never told me about anything like this. I mean, you don't need a piano like that. Here. Oh, wow, this is a piano. Hello, Mr. Pierre. So, did he work well today? It's a concert pianist's piano, isn't it? That's quite a gift your husband is giving you, because it's not cheap. - Here. - Charles, you're going to play on it now. Yes. Come on, let's go. Goodbye, ma'am. Julie, come and eat lunch. I'll be there in a minute. Did the doorbell ring? I didn't hear anything. No, not in the morning. And on an empty stomach. - What's wrong with you today? - Nothing. Are you sure the doorbell didn't ring? Are you expecting someone? Have your lunch now. I'll go see. I said no! Mom, my fingers! My fingers! Mom! Mom! - Julie… - Mom! My fingers! Julie! When can I play the piano again? The piano? You'll have to wait a little for that. But for school, no problem. Goodbye. Come on. Where are you going? You can't stay here. Are you the parents? No, my daughter was born here in this ward. I wanted to show her. Ah, okay. But you have to put on a gown, then. Come with me. Parents often come back. - What's your name? - Julie. Julie. Excuse me if I'm wrong, but aren't you a pianist? Yes. I remember now. I knew you when you were this big. Have you resumed traveling for your concerts? Come on. You used to give concerts? Yes. I used to play for you. - Come on, come in and greet the audience. - What audience? - Me. - What are you having me do? Come on, come in and I'll clap for you. It is your turn. I'll play with my left hand? I'll stop. You're stopping? Do you like playing the piano? I don't know. You don't want to answer me? Yes, I do. I've never questioned it. We're going to leave here. Mom! Come on! We're almost there! I can't anymore. I want to stop. Up to the top. You don't want to come? You can do anything with your ten fingers. Without ever having any problems. You're perfect. And always sure of yourself. And you can't climb up to the top? Anyone can walk. Come on! Come with me! I'm going to lie down a little. I'll be back. Hey! Hey, wake up! Bitch. Are you feeling okay? Do you want us to take you home? - Hello? - Hello, Julie? It's Dad. You good? Yes. I'm calling you about tomorrow night. Mind coming Monday instead? Hello, Julie? Oh, I forgot. Is there something wrong? Okay for Monday. What are you doing right now? I'm at the piano. We're going to eat. See you on Monday, then? Bye, Dad. What did he say again? He said to talk to her. Talk to her as much as possible. That it was important for her. Do you believe in talking to her? Hello, Juliette. Well, you're early again. It's a little quirk with you. Oh, my little pussy cat. Oh, no. No, my little pussy cat. It's okay, come here. It's okay, Juliette, right? Oh, honey. And look. It's beautiful here. This place is perfect. It's not certain the baby will live, you know. Yes, it will. Right? You've never done anything like everyone else. Julie… You know, you… You're going to get out of your box, and… you're going to breathe with me. Dream. Dream that you'll see me and I'll talk to you. I'll never stop talking to you. Thank you. Do you see me like I see you? Julie? Are you listening? I played for you. You have to think a lot about Mom. Remember that I'm talking to you. You used to talk to her all the time when she was in my belly. Why should it be different now? You're ashamed to talk in front of me. Why should I be? But now, I don't know what to say to her. Anyway, what do you want her to understand? You don't even dare look at her. Of course I look at her. With her wires everywhere. You're not sleeping? How are you feeling today? Did the doctor come? Juliette, can you hear me? Give me a sign that you understand. Talk to me. My Juliette. Look at me. - Juliette! - It's all right. It's going to be okay. You look a lot better today. It's funny coming back here to see you, remember? Here you go. Juliette? Juliette! Why aren't you answering? - What are you doing? - I'm recording for Julie. - I promised her. - Do you really believe this? Why won't you finish the work in her room? You're not asleep? No. It's my last night here, so I'm taking advantage of it. You know, you can stay a while if you want. It's allowed when you have a preemie. Yeah, I know. But I have to work on my piano. You're a pianist? Yes. Do you give concerts? - Hello. - Hello. I'd like to speak to Juliette Chevalier. She's not here. Tell her I must speak to her. What do you need? I have some news for her. - She's not here. - Oh. I heard her playing the piano when she came in. - I was playing. - It was you? What's your name? My name is Julie. Julie, like Juliette? It's almost the same. Is that your mother? Well… Give her this, and tell her that I'm not the only one who liked it. Tell her she can start playing again. Hello! - Who is that guy? - He wanted to see Mom. Today, I'm going to the hairdresser. I won't be here tonight. Your dad will sleep here. Hey, are you listening to me? Yes. Can I come with you to the hairdresser? I want to get my hair cut. That's a funny idea with the hair you have. I'm going to surprise Mom. In that case, keep what you've got. There's no hurry. - Turn off the piano. It's annoying me. - If that's what you want. Julie, sit down. Look, I've already told your father. We're having her sleep as much as possible. I can see her sleeping. You don't want me to see her sleeping? It's not the same for me. - Why? - Because. Because it hurts me less than it'd hurt you to see her like this. Do you think it will hurt me to see my mother sleeping? Listen Julie, what are you trying to do? Huh? Trying to stir me up? You think now's the time for that? You know, I've known Mom for a long time. How do we count her age? Do we start at birth or do we wait until she's out of the incubator? For school, for example. For school? You've got some ideas. She is ten days old today. What did you say to her? What did you talk to her about? A lot of things. I don't know, a bit of everything. The doctor, the one you like, he talked to me earlier. Without trying too hard to reassure me, like with you. Because I'm not the mother. And so? So, it's scary. Why don't you answer? Because it's the truth? Do you realize what you're saying? What? What am I saying? Do you want to have a normal child? You can't stay like this. We're getting out of here. Hi, Mom. How are you? When I was little, I was afraid my fingers were too big and too short. I tried to make them longer by pulling on them. I would tie a string to each finger and then the strings to a doorknob and close it. Sometimes, I would soak them in vinegar for hours to make them grow. You need to have long fingers too. Very long fingers. Very, very long. So you can play everything. I bought a piano for us both. I like it when I talk to you. I like it more and more. Since you've been here, when I go to sleep at night, I think of extraordinary things. Yesterday, I imagined that I was playing with four hands. Four hands. Do you think that's possible? I like it when I talk to you. Here, there was no more orange juice so I got you this. And this. There you go. You're not too tired? Julie Chevalier. I'll be back. Hello, miss. Subtitle translation by: K.M. Kownacki
