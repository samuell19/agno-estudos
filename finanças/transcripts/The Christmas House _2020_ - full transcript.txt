your honor. Ladies and gentleman of the jury... As the evidence shows, my client is not only wrongly accused, but is a victim of corruption at the highest level. [lawyer] objection. Your honor, there is no evidence that any other entities were involved in this case. The defense is purposely attempting to mislead the court. You're on thin ice, counselor. My apologies, your honor. Opposing counsel is correct. We couldn't find any proof that my client was framed. Until we searched his office. [door opens] your honor, my client is innocent. This case is dismissed, and all charges are dropped. My name is cleared and I'll be home in time for christmas. Thank you, clint. You're welcome. And, counselor... ...You're out of order. [audience applauding] we want to thank you all for your hard work on the season finale of handsome justice. We had a great season and we cannot wait to get back to work in the new year. Now, please, everyone, ask santa claus to pick us up for another season. [audience chuckles] uh, mike, did you want to say a few words? And turn down a captive audience? Never. [audience chuckles] to me, this is a dream job, and it's a privilege to work with all of you. When I moved out here from new york, I didn't know what to expect, but, together, we've built something really special that will hopefully continue for many years to come. The network isn't sure about another season. Haven't they seen our ratings? We almost beat that pet detective show. Yeah, new corporate leadership, and you know how that goes. Is there anything we can do? Pray for a christmas miracle. And keep this news to yourself. There's no point in worrying everyone over the holiday break, hmm? [] [phone ringing] hey, mom and dad. Hey! How's our favorite tv lawyer? Good, good. All wrapped up for the season, and everything is... Super... Super good! Great. Hopefully, now you get some time off. Maybe more than I'd like. What was that? Hmm? I was just saying, yeah, I'll have-- I'll have some time off. Oh, well, that's perfect because I have a-- well, we-- we have a project that we need your help with. What kind of project? Oh, one that's going to bring back all kinds of happy memories. And one that you cannot say no to because it is for your beloved parents. No way. You're not... Bringing back the christmas house? Yes, we are! I know it's been a long time. Decades, actually. Yeah, and it's a lot of work. So much work. But we really want to do it one more time. I'm finally retired now, and I've got a lot of time to be able to spend with your guys, and this is something we can do together. That's right. But christmas eve is in two weeks. You guys do remember it used to take us an entire month to move out all the furniture, hang the decorations inside, outside the house, set up the animatronics. You can't do it all in two weeks. Yes, we can. We've already called your brother, and he's got the bakery in for a remodel, and jake can work from anywhere, so they are coming tomorrow to help. They are? Oh, yeah. Flying in tomorrow afternoon. So, this is really happening. After 20 years, the christmas house is coming back. But it's not just that. Christmas... It's about traditions. This was ours. And I miss it. Look, we know you're busy, honey, but this would really mean a lot to your mother. And to me. Sure. Yeah, I will pack tonight and change my flight. Thank you, honey. Love you. Yeah. Love you, too. [] no updates yet. Has anyone ever actually died from suspense? You sure you don't want to tell your family yet? I mean, we're about to be in close quarters with them for the next couple weeks. It might to be hard to keep this a secret. Look, adoptions fall through all the time. It's hard enough for us during this process. I don't want to get their hopes up until we're at the finish line. [mike] you're out of order! Handsome justice? No? Nothing? Oh... Sir, all I can do for you right now is put an alert in the system. When your bag is located, we'll deliver it to you. Great. [brandon] oh, my gosh! It's clint handsome! Can we get a selfie with you? We are your biggest fans. Yeah. [click] you guys do know I actually have fans. Besides our parents? [service representative] excuse me. Can you move to the side, please? Yeah. So, jake, you think you're ready for this? The legendary mitchell family christmas house? No surface inside or out is left untouched. The electric bill alone-- record-breaking. Construction, painting, hanging snowflakes. Glitter everywhere. And don't forget the trees. And tons of indoor fake snow. But you really think it's gonna take all of us two weeks to put this together? He has no idea. No. -It's probably for the best. -Yeah. -We need to grab the rental car. -I'll drive. I can do it. Jake, can you hold this for a second? [] yep, that was him! Clint handsome. Whoo! No, I'm not going to do that. [] they're here! Hey! Welcome home! Oh! Hey, buddy. [] [] [mom] the dynamic duo. I've come a long way since majestic mike. Thank goodness. She's back, you know? She... She moved home after the divorce. Oh? Maybe you guys could bring back the old act. Oh, I think magic was just a phase for us. They don't really hand out cool points to magicians in high school. Well, I was proud. It took guts to get up on that stage, do those tricks. And you guys were great. Hey, why is dad's watch in here? He is always leaving this thing around. Honey... I'm so glad that you are here. I thank you for coming home early. [whistle blowing] family meeting! Pronto! Men... We've got a heck of a task ahead of us, and it's going to take a strong will and a mighty heart to get it all done. She's been like this all week. This is the christmas house punch list and schedule, divided by category and chores for each person. Wow. Can I just say that after hearing about the famous mitchell christmas house for years, I am so honored and thrilled to be a part of this operation. Thank you, jake. Have I told you lately you're my favorite son-in-law? You might be her favorite son, period, if you're going to be this peppy. All right, guys, I need you to focus, come on. Bill? Who taught dad powerpoint? I took a class at the library. In the beginning, it was nothing but a dream-- a dream inspired by the hudson valley holiday-house tours, and a desire for dazzling decorations that would outdo them all-- but no dream-- no dream-- can become a reality without someone to lead the way, and so, family, without further ado, I give you mom. [mom] step one--clean-out. Now, mike, you and your dad are going to pick up the truck, so that we can load it up and get the decorations in here. You guys still have those decorations? Some of those have got to be, what, 40 years old. So's your sense of style, but you don't hear us saying anything about it. Hey, it's part of the charm of it-- bringing back the old favorites. Step two-- set up the animatronics and start hanging the ceiling ornaments. Step three, the trains. -Trains? -They have their own room. Step four-- hang the garlands and trim the trees. Now, mike, I'm putting you in charge of those. We need a firm needle, and six to seven feet tall, and a gently-sloping triangle shape. Can you remember what I taught you is the most important thing about choosing a tree? A sturdy limb is perfect to trim. You know, in my opinion, 1997 was our best year. It was just great attention to detail. And, mike, you really delivered on the garland fluffing. It just--quality fluffing. Thank you. Brandon, I need you to step up this year. -Make me proud, buddy. -Sir, yes, sir. What's with the-- -oh, yeah. -[laughing] I fell asleep on the couch, and brandon thought it would be a fun idea to maim me. [jake] no. [brandon] it's called manscaping. -No. It's not. -[mom] all right. All right, step five-- snow--lay the snow, garnish the rooms. Step six-- outdoor lighting, and figurines, and the staging-- and I'm so excited about this because you know what they have now that we didn't have when you all were young? Inflatable yard decor. Oh, boy. Step seven-- that's cookies and the candy canes. That's my favorite part. Well, good. Because you're gonna need to make 12 dozen of everything this year. Question. Yes, brandon? Will majestic mike be performing? Oh... Majestic mike. He was a neighborhood favorite. No, thank you. I hung up my cape. Well, we still have time to change your mind. So... You guys got your marching orders. We start tomorrow, bright and early. Any questions? I, for one, am honored to participate. Yeah. It'll be fine. Fun! It'll be fun. Christmas waits for no man. Let's do this. [whistle blowing] [repeated whistle tweets] aw, mom! Aw! [] [mom] most of this is already scheduled, and... [yawns] tell me there's coffee. [mom] mike. Mike, honey. Do you guys have oat milk, or any dairy alternatives? Mike mitchell. You've gone totally hollywood. [mom laughs] andi cruz. Hi, mike. Nice outfit. Yeah. Yeah. The airline-- the airline lost my luggage. What are you doing here? Mike. I'm sorry. I... I just didn't expect to find andi cruz in our kitchen... This morning. We're staying at my mom's for now. Ah, you're next door? Just like old times. [mom] andi's son, noah, is at my school. Can you believe the timing? If I had stayed just one more year, we could have been there together. [andi] oh, well, if you were still working, who would oversee the christmas house? Ah... Roped in like the rest of us. Are you kidding? You couldn't keep me away. This is the best part of christmas. Okay, andi, this has been fun. Really good to see you again. Um, but I've got to run, put on something-- literally, anything else. [andi] that's a great idea. Okay. Andi cruz. [laughing] [] [whistle blowing] your father's downstairs, ready to get the truck. Was that really necessary? [tweets repeatedly] [mike] they're still doing the same show. [dad] every year. Hey, you remember when you were the head elf? You wouldn't stop taking curtain calls. Elena had to literally carry you off the stage. Should have known back then you'd become an actor. Is andi's mom still running the place? Oh, yeah. And she's very proud that one of her performers now has his own tv show. Hey, I get the sense that this whole christmas house thing is more mom than you. No, no. We both wanted to do it. Hmm. It just seemed like a sudden decision, when, normally, you guys are such planners. Well, it's not just your mother and me. It's for everybody. But it would be nice if your brother and you would maybe try to make this a special christmas for your mom. There have been a lot of changes this year, and I think... It's hard to adjust. I thought she'd be happy to be retired. -You were. -I was. I still am, but your mom and I are very different. We are so happy to have you boys home. I'm happy to be home. Hey... I saw andi this morning. Does she come by a lot, or? Is that you asking or majestic mike? I was just surprised, that's all. I haven't talked to her in a long time. I'm surprised you two haven't stayed in touch. You share a lot of history. Yeah. Careful, guys, that's my favorite. It's also incredibly heavy. Because it's real oak. I can't remember this weighing so much. Because I bought it last year. I don't remember this being so hard. Me either. All you used to care about is who could get the most boxes in the truck in the least amount of time. [neck cracks] winner gets 20 bucks. Bring it. Oh, I hope you both have sons one day. Hello? -Hello! -Hey. Hi. I come bearing coffee. How neighborly of you. I'm sorry it's not a fermented chia-seed smoothie or whatever celebrities drink. Don't knock it till you've tried it. I'm kidding. Fermented chia-seed smoothies-- so last year. I must say, I'm a bit disappointed not to see what other high-school clothes might be lurking in your closet. And I am sorry to rob you of the chance of seeing me in a sweet mock turtleneck, but my luggage arrived. Who are those guys? I'd like to point out that we're the ones doing the heavy lifting while mike appears to be on a coffee break. And I'd like to point out that we're way too old to be tattling. Andi! Hi! Hi! Surprise! As much as I enjoy moving, I thought that this would make the day easier on all of us, so put down the boxes, take a coffee. I guess I should have brought champagne, but-- just show the movers what needs to go where. Oh, we'll show them. By the way, bro, our deal is off, however, I win. Mm. [brandon] come on, babe. Boys, follow me! Well, this was very thoughtful of you, andi. You didn't have to do this. Oh, it's the least I could do for my favorite new clients. I'm so grateful for the listing, and I'm committed to finding you the right buyer. You guys are selling the house? So, what should we do today? ♪ ♪ wow. Can we get some sun? ♪ ♪ uh, mom? Can we go to the beach? (beep beep beep) should we just go see a movie? Yes! I'm always up for a good movie. Go rogue in the all-new, fiercely reimagined nissan rogue.

When were you going to tell us you're selling the house? We were going to bring it up last night, but it was... Well, it was so lovely just being together, and we decided to wait, and then we've been so busy today. I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry. I assumed that everybody knew. It's fine. I'm actually relieved that the cat's out of the bag. And I'll make sure that whoever moves into the house next loves it as-- as much as you do. I'm still processing. Where will you guys go? Are you leaving town? What's the time table on this? Well... We're still working that out. This is why you wanted to do the christmas house this year, isn't it? Because this is the last time we'll all be here together. It was a hard decision, but it's the right one. And we can talk about this later, okay? I'm sorry. Yeah. But don't be too hard on them. It's christmas. Thank you for the coffee. -And the movers. -Of course. You mind if we stop at the store? I told mom I'd cook. Earth to mike. Something doesn't seem right. What does that mean? Why are they selling the house? Downsizing is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. That's a lot of house for two people. The real question is, why are you so upset about it? It's my childhood home. It's mine, too. And you don't feel anything about the fact it's our last christmas there? Sure, I do. But as much as I love that house, it's part of my past. I had my time there, so did you, and now it'll belong to the next family. You think you're so wise. It's about time you recognized it. I am brimming with wisdom. I am up to my eyeballs in wisdom. Do you want to hear some more? No, I think I'm good, thank you. -Sometimes, you look-- -all good. Just saying. Oh, look at "muscles." [click] you're on tv. I've seen your show. Yeah? It's always nice to meet a fan. Well, I said I've seen the show-- not that I like it. Oh. Mike, this is my son, noah. Hey, noah. He's playing it cool, he absolutely loves your show. My mom always says she knew there was something special about you. Your mom said that? I doubt I said that. No, you did. You said it when we watched the show last week. You were all like, "ah, I always knew there was something special about that guy." he has you confused with someone else. It must be the other guy from our high school with the tv show. No, no, no, no. I don't-- she was-- she was talking about you. I told him that we were professional colleagues. You know, majestic mike and awesome andi. That was the extent of my stage career. So, do you still do magic? No, not since my stage partner quit on me. Retired. Okay, bud. It's time for homework and dinner. [sighs] okay. Well, it was nice meeting you. Likewise. See you tomorrow? You will? Tree day. Right. -Bye! -See ya, noah. [sifter sifting] [mom, in memory] okay, brandon, we just pull this, and this is powdered sugar, and you just pull that handle, okay? -Yeah. -Just pull it. [young mike] mom! Pull it hard. Pull it easy. [young mike] brandon! Come back a little more on this-- oh! Oh, ho! Oh... Well... We'll figure it out. Did you do a double-knot this time? Yeah, smart. [mom laughing] some things never change. Well, people love my rosettes. I'm one of them. They're on the menu at the bakery. A tribute to you. Aw! Wow. Who would have thought, after all this time in here with me at the holidays, would turn you into a bonafide professional? Certainly not me. Remember the first time I made spice bars? You could have broken a window with those things. Yeah. Maybe I can come and visit you in denver after the holidays. Sure. We'd love having you and dad-- especially during ski season. I meant, just me. Solo girls' trip? Got the time now. Why not? Hey... You are welcome any time. [laughing] [whistle blows] I sent mike and andi to the tree lot. Hey, jake, what do you call a christmas tree that knows kung-fu? -What? -Spruce lee. It's a dad joke. Brandon and jake, I need you to get started on the outside. Bill, I'm putting you on party invitations. That should be easy for you since you're always out and about anyway. That's generally what one does when one is retired, and you know I like to keep busy. Yes, you do. I'm going to organize the inside decorations, and tonight... We'll hang the ornaments. Now, get out there and make christmas happen! [whistles] on it. Guys, come on! How about this one? No, this one. Whoa. This one for sure. Yeah, that's a winner. That's perfect. Now we just need four more like it. On it! You know, being on tree duty with you guys got me out of untangling twinkly lights, so thank you for that. I thought noah would enjoy it. I did when I was a kid. You know, it really surprised me how you reacted to your parents selling the house. It's... It's been a long time since you lived here. This place has always been home base. I've moved a lot, but... It was just nice knowing it was always here if I needed it. That's how I feel, too. After the divorce, I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. So... Tell me about l.A. Tell me about all the glamorous parties that you go to every night. More like in bed by 9:00 p.M. Every night because of early call times and even earlier workouts with a trainer that does not care if I want a social life. That has pretty much been my life the last three years. Stars--they're just like us. Except, instead of early-morning workouts with a trainer, I have a 10-year-old, so soccer practice, homework, bedtime. While other people go out, or, I don't know, sleep, I usually catch up on work. You ever wonder what all the hustle is for? Hey, guys! I think I found another one! It's for him. When noah's father moved overseas, it felt so nice to be in a place that was familiar, you know? Like, people know you and care about you, vice versa. And he gets to experience everything I loved about this place, and I get to experience it with him all again. That sounds pretty great. Wow! Look at this one! What do you think? Ooh, looks good. Before we decide, choose a branch and give it a little tug. If any of the needles come off in your hand, then you know it's too dry. Okay. Did you get any needles? Nope. They all stayed on. Then we got a winner. -[phone ringing] -[noah] great. Nice. -I got to grab this. -Yeah. I hope you're calling with good news. I wish I was, but I'm sorry to say, handsome justice is canceled. I'm going to keep hammering them. Do you really think you can change their minds? It's christmas. Anything can happen. Sorry about that. [noah] guys, what do you think about this one? Ooh. Someday I'm going to marry you. Yes someday I'm going to marry you. Someday we'll buy that little place on ellsworth. Some days, will be rougher than others. ♪ someday, 50 years will have gone by, and I'll ask you to marry me, all over again. Someday. ♪ someday. [son] mom! Yeah... [son] I fell. Okay there's bandages in the cabinet. [son] I'm bleeding. Grab two. Sheba. What cats want. [] [bill, in memory] looks pretty good. It's perfect. Yeah! Yeah. It's beautiful. So are you. [kids] yuck! Okay, all right, okay. You think I should send a letter to santa about those two? I think that there is still time to get them on the naughty list. [bill] oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. We're nice. [laughing] we're nice. -Right here. -Perfect. Oh... [door opens] [mike] watch your head, mom. I remember that one. From dad. -Yeah. -This is good. Hey, it's not christmas until the first ornament is on the tree. Go for it. But you always hang the first one. Eh. All right. No pressure. [mom] so that one will be the family tree this year. That one will be the snowflake, and that one will be the toy tree. Toy tree? Oh, each tree has a theme, so now we've got to find the ornaments so we can get to decorating. All right, let's go. Okay. That garland's not going to fluff itself. At least she didn't blow the whistle. Yeah. [whistle blows] we've got to take that thing away from her. Hey, so after doing this for 10,000 hours, I discovered a little trick. As you work your way down the garland, move each branch-- left, right, up, and down. That's how you get uniform fluffage. Fluffage? It's a technical term. [text alert chimes] oh, I swear it's like clockwork. The only time a client need me is when I'm busy doing something else. I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to go show a house to someone. Is this an elaborate scheme to get out of fluffing garland? You're not nearly as pompous as I expected you to be now. Thanks. Lucky for you, I find it charming. Oh, noah. What? Well, I'll have to take him with me. My mother's volunteering at the library today. Just leave him here. We'll put him to work. Like our very own little elf. I mean, what self-respecting christmas house doesn't have its own elf? That's a good point. Are you sure? -Yeah. -Okay. [andi] noah? Please tell me you need help with that. "majestic mike's traveling caravan." whoa. That's when mike used to be a big-time magician. I dabbled. [bill] hey, hey, don't sell yourself short. Majestic mike could really pack in a crowd. Your mom was part of the act, too. Her stage name was awesome andi. They were quite a pair. They would play birthday parties, and then every christmas eve, they would come here to the christmas house and put on this great, big, fantastic magic show. People came from miles around to see it. Well, people came for the house. We just happened to be performing in the yard. Do you guys think maybe I could learn? Well, now, that depends. Learning magic is a lot of hard work. I can work hard. It also takes a lot of practice. I'll practice. I don't know. Mike, you think he's got the calling? Only a true magician can know for sure. They feel it in their bones. Yeah, yeah! I feel it. Definitely. In that case, I'll bet you, if you asked him, majestic mike might just dust off his old tricks for you. Absolutely. Oh, and a cape. He's definitely going to need a cape. Yeah, yeah, the cape. Definitely. Are your parents actually going to put on more christmas lights than this? Yes. I mean... I love twinkly lights, but is there such a thing as too many? Don't let my parents hear you say that. This time next year, we're gonna be decorating as a family of three. I hope so. I can't wait. Did you hear from the agency today? If I had, don't you think I would have said something? It was just a question. Dinner's ready. Great. I could use some carbs. I'm sorry. All I've been thinking about is whether the adoption will go through, and on top of that, I'm not there to oversee the bakery renovation. It's nice being here, but the timing isn't great. Hey. It's so good that we're here. We need some time together, away from work stress, and adoption stress, and... This is just going to give us so many great memories, and... Inspiration for when we celebrate christmas... With our kids. Do you think we'll decorate like this when we have kids? Absolutely not. Hey, honey, remember when we got this in that little shop in the berkshires? Tiny place. You were pregnant with brandon. That was the little reindeer figurine. We got this teapot when I was pregnant with mike, and it was in annendale on the hudson. That was our last christmas, it was just the two of us. I remember it because I know how I felt. I was so proud and excited-- and nervous about the birth of our first child... And so grateful for the happiness that I was feeling. See, this is not just a teapot-- this is a part of our family's history. Maybe I'm the only one who thinks it matters, but I do, so. Ultimately, the memory of a thing is really all you have. All right, let's eat while it's still warm. Hi. Hi. This is a surprise. I come bearing gifts. Well, no, a gift. And it's actually for noah. I recognize that. Yeah... I figured it was time to pass on to someone who'll actually use it. Or you could have just dropped it off at the house. And miss the look on your face when you saw the old case of tricks? No way. Noah asked me about stage partners. Apparently, there's a girl in his school that he wants to invite to perform with him. Go, noah. I was actually thinking that I could take him by the magic shop. You know, introduce him to the basics. The art of performance. I saw her billboard today. Your competition? More like domination. She's been the only game in town for a long time, and... It's tough to compete. You know, I could post something on my social media? About me? You think that could work? Well, I have 1.2 million followers, so... Could make a splash. Thanks, but I'm... I'm focusing on building more of a local presence. [phone ringing] sorry. I got to take this. Hello? Okay... Sure. Right now? Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Thanks. Sorry. That was my agent. Oh, you don't have to say that just to impress me. No, it actually was. There's this work thing. It's a commercial, and they want me to try out some taglines for it as soon as possible. Taglines for what? When your odor is out of order, reach for grift body spray. Now in a new scent-- justice. You can do way better than that. You're out of order-- but justice never smelled so good. Grift body spray. Get yours today. That felt weird. Did it sound weird? Sounds pretty weird. Ooh. What's my secret weapon in court? Grift body spray. Justice never smelled so good. What do you think? I think your job is very strange, but I have to admit, it was quite entertaining. Then my work here is done. See ya. Thank you. Et voilà. Honey, this looks wonderful. Show-off. We can't all be magicians or tv lawyers, mike. Mike gave noah his old magic kit. Oh! Wow, there was a time I thought that you would never get rid of that thing. It's very nice that you're passing it on. I told andi I'd give him a few lessons, help him get his bearings. When we were in high school, andi broke mike's heart. No, she didn't. We were friends. So you're helping her kid to learn magic because as a friend. Yeah, yeah. See? He's not just a nice guy on tv-- he's one in real life, too. Thank you, jake. Actually, I wanted to tell you guys. The network canceled handsome justice. What? Oh... No, it's fine. This is the gig, you know? When I get back to l.A., I will look for the next job, but for now, I am just grateful that we can enjoy the holiday together as a family. -Sorry, honey. -Thanks. This year's been... A lot.

Andi cruz homes. Come home for the holidays. Hey! Those are for santa! You're out of order! Sustained. -Mm! -[andi laughs] [doorbell rings] what a wonderful hat. Oh! Why, thank you. I'm here to audition. Come right on in. Silver dollar. Ordinary glass. [bill, in memory] whoa! How the heck did you do that? A magician never reveals his tricks. Oh, I see. You know, mike, a lot of magicians have, like, a helper, or a partner, to do tricks with them. -They do? -Oh, yeah. So if you know somebody, or you find somebody that, you know, might be a good partner, you could ask them to join your act. Because magic is really something to be shared. You know, it's a lot like christmas. So what do you say? Can I perform at the party? Absolutely. Yes! So... You haven't mentioned the video. The video? What video? Come on, the one I posted? How have you not seen it? It has, like, over a hundred thousand views. Oh, yeah, that video. Yeah. It was cute. It would be nice if the face of my business was actually my own. Okay. I hear that. This was just to get everyone's attention. The next one... The next one? ...We do together. I have an idea. Lay it on me. I'm all about collaboration. How about I have my people call your people if I want your help. -Okay? -Okay. [mike] have you and mom started looking for new places yet? Can't really think about that until the new year. It's hard to imagine you guys in a different house. Yeah, it is. Hey, do you really want to sell? I want your mother to be happy. Is everything okay? It will be. Do you think mom and dad are acting weird? Weird how? Selling the house, not telling us about it, not having a plan for when they move. That doesn't seem like them. Typical mike. What does that mean? Sometimes, you look for problems where there aren't any. Could it be that what you're really feeling is your own unfinished business with a certain girl next door? Would you quit with that? No. This is supposed to be the mitchell family christmas to end all christmases, and... I just feel like things are off. So you don't think this has at all to do with the fact that, suddenly, you're around andi again, like old times. You're available, she's available. I mean, you've got her kid doing magic tricks, for crying out loud. This has got "second chance" written all over it. Yeah. Well, how can there be a second chance when there was never a first one? Well... Maybe this is your second chance at a first chance. No. With everything going on right now, I can't even think about that. Hey, this is our last christmas here. I know you got a lot on your mind, but try to be in the moment, okay? -Okay? -Ow! Okay? Okay. -I played softball. -Mom! [] that's really good. I know, but I don't know where to put it. There's no place to put it. Looks like a little present. Look at these trees that I made. [conversation continues] your baking skills. Why don't we use your baking skills, right, dad? -Yeah. -Am I right? Hey... The christmas mouse. Yeah. Do you remember how we used to hide her all over the house for you kids to find. Mm-hmm. Except for the year when you hid her and forgot where. Oh, right, and then we had to start writing it down after that. You know, I had another one at school. When I was principal, I used to hide her in a different classroom every day, and the kids would have to find her. It's so strange to drive by there and know that somebody else is watching over it. You worked hard for a long time. It must be nice to have a break. I'm not on a break. It's done. Your dad made it look so easy to retire. You know, when you're raising kids... And you're both working... You're focused on the same things. Is that why you guys are selling the house? To get a fresh start? Well, we need some perspective, so, um... We are going to move into separate places after the holidays. Now, I really... I don't want you to say anything about this. Please. Because we want everyone to enjoy this holiday together. Right? It's not one last christmas house. It's one last christmas. I'm sorry, mom. [buzzing and popping] [screaming] [screaming] [mom] oh, no! Gives a whole new meaning to the term "silent night," huh? Did you know that geico's whole 15 minutes thing... That came from me. Really. My first idea was “in one quarter of an hour, your savings will tower... Over you.
