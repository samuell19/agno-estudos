The film is based on true events and characters, but isn't an accurate re-enactment: the creators maintained a true-to-life presentation of the general state of affairs, while using artistic license in depicting events and characters, such as the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Head of Military intelligence, the Chief of Staff, and others. In early 1973, Israel had reports of Syrian and Egyptian intentions for launching a war against Israel during that Summer. Head of Military Intelligence, Major-General Eli Zeira, and several others high-ranking officers estimated that the probability of war was low. Minister of Defence, Moshe Dayan, David Elazar, believed otherwise: that war was imminent. They issued an alert, while calling up reserves. As summer passed and war had not broken out, MI's assessment: "low probability of war", became the cardinal national conception. THE SILENCE OF THE SIRENS Tuesday, 25th of September 1973 11 days before Yom Kippur ﻿Station C over... ﻿This is "Driver", code "Narkiss" on "Gazit" channel... ﻿Good evening. Madam. He's waiting inside. ﻿You have some nerve, getting here so late. ﻿You don't keep royalty waiting for 20 minutes. ﻿I want all reports, on Egyptian and Syrian relations by tomorrow. ﻿Please sit down - I don't want to sit down. ﻿I don't believe any of it. ﻿He came here so in case of war, we wouldn't deport ﻿hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees to Jordan. ﻿Moshe? - No. there's no cause for concern. ﻿We know that they've issued an alert. We have our own sources. ﻿We've taken all precautions: ﻿tomorrow we'll begin to reinforce the Golan Heights. ﻿No... I don't see any cause for concern. ﻿I'll come by your office tomorrow morning. ﻿Alright. Good, night. Moshe. ﻿So what else is new.. ﻿You can see it all in last week's aerials. ﻿Yes, I agree, but still... why was he in a rush to meet? ﻿Let's re-examine ourselves: has the Syrian deployment changed? ﻿No. ﻿Are the Syrians and Egyptians "cooking up something"? ﻿Will they strike prior to obtaining long-range fighters? ﻿Before extending their surface-to-surface range? ﻿It doesn’t conform with our assessment. ﻿We also know that they made these strategic decisions: ﻿not to strike till they complete their anti-aircraft apparatus. ﻿Yes. OK. I'll call you back. I'm in a rush. Later. ﻿I’m attending a toast at the General Staff, so bump ﻿the Branch Head meeting to 15:30 hours. Hope I'll make it. ﻿I think he approached us because of friction on the Syrian front. ﻿He found out the Syrians are initiating emergency deployment. ﻿because of their 13 MiGs that we shot down 10 days ago. ﻿and he's probably concerned we might ﻿launch a pre-emptive strike through his territory. ﻿Happy new year. To you to. Happy holiday. ﻿Good morning, guys. - Good morning. ﻿In you go. Look at this, Amram. ﻿The Egyptian Army advanced 2 armoured divisions: ﻿one in the Suez area. The other around Ismailiya. ﻿These are new artillery regiments and field engineering companies. ﻿They weren't deployed here last week. ﻿A routine exercise deployment. They do it every year. Read the reports from September last year. ﻿This year's a bit different. ﻿Their Air Force was put on alert 10 days ago. ﻿Isn't it fishy that they advanced 3 squadrons to Alexandria? ﻿They put the Air Force on alert when we shot down the MiGs. ﻿What do you want to write in today's intelligence estimate? ﻿No cause for concern. ﻿Shouldn't we allude to the "heads-up" we got from Hussein ﻿and put the General Staff on its toes. ﻿Get command intelligence branches to open their eyes. ﻿No. it will cause panic. Someone might call up reserves. ﻿You think we're heading for war? - No. ﻿I didn't say that. ﻿But Hussein's warning and this redeployment might be related. ﻿Listen, they only brought up two brigades ﻿and put the Air Force on alert. ﻿Miri. send in the stenographer, will you. ﻿Victor, you had a lot of calls. ﻿Head of Operations wants you to attend the-meeting on Sunday. ﻿He asked if you could... - Nurit. I need a cup of coffee. ﻿Victor, we already had this discussion. I don't make coffee. ﻿Alright. ﻿Sorry. ﻿What are you so worried about, Gabai ﻿That they'll strike tomorrow? - No. But... ﻿They keep talking about it. ﻿You've got to understand that Sadat's head works differently. ﻿He's a country boy, Leibo. ﻿He regards land as sacred. ﻿The Egyptians aren't idiots. ﻿I know they aren't. ﻿They're-just feeling awfully humiliated. ﻿You can see it in every poem written by every poet there. ﻿What are they going to strike with? MiG-17's? ﻿T-54's? They know they're not prepared for war ﻿Then why did they bring up two bridging battalions to the Canal? ﻿Answer me. Can you ask her to fix me a cup of tea? ﻿Nah. forget it. ﻿Don't want to start fighting, with her so early in the morning. ﻿So do me a favour, stop smoking in here. ﻿I'm choking to death. ﻿You know what, let's talk with Richter again. The thing with the bridging force doesn't look like exercise. ﻿Let's talk to the Southern Command Intelligence Officer. ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿Let's pass Hussein's warning. Source omitted. ﻿We couldn't do that! - Why not? ﻿Nurit, get me Southern Command Intelligence Officer. ﻿What's with you? - Let him tell his observers ﻿to stop reading the papers and start doing their jobs. ﻿Why let them see the events through our eyes, huh? ﻿When the General of Southern Command hears of this. ﻿He'll call our General. ﻿What is this, kindergarten? ﻿You're getting in over your head! - Victor... Gedalia. Good morning. Listen, I want to relay an urgent report. November 1973 Agranat Commission, investigating the war ﻿The Minister of Defence and the Chief of Staff ﻿and the head of military intelligence, ﻿all knew about the meeting with Hussein. And none of them had seen any cause for concern. ﻿They all thought the King was misinformed. ﻿Madam, did Hussein relay any political message from Sadat? ﻿Hussein relayed no such message, from Sadat. ﻿because Sadat did not give him any political message to relay! ﻿The negotiations he initiated' in 72 ﻿were a smokescreen! ﻿We know Hussein's source. ﻿He's a Syrian Major-General, but not very reliable. Hussein is wrong. I've been saying this for the last year. ﻿The Syrians wouldn't strike alone, and Egypt is not ready for war. ﻿Even a hick like Sadat knows this. - So why advance a division ﻿and deploy it in the Canal area. ﻿They did it as part of a military exercise scheduled for next week. ﻿This division has been /deployed there every year... ﻿I have to say I disagree with Eli's opinion. ﻿Hussein's source is excellent: even we don't have such sources. I'm not worried about a joint Syrian-Egyptian attack. ﻿The Egyptians know that they can't force the Canal. ﻿But there's no canal in the Golan Heights. ﻿Would the Syrians try to take over a settlement? - No... King Hussein wouldn't have rushed over here so urgently ﻿unless he was afraid the Syrians might get him into trouble! ﻿We mustn't ignore this! ﻿An unaided attack against Israel would be suicidal for Syria. ﻿By the way, the General of Southern Command asked me about a warning ﻿that his intelligence officer received from your guys. ﻿Did you issue a warning? ﻿I'll... I'll look into it. ﻿Sir, how informed were you of PM's meeting with Hussein? ﻿I was handed the report concerning the meeting on that very night. ﻿I was also given, military intelligence's estimates ﻿concerning Hussein's sources. ﻿In spite of military intelligence's estimate ﻿of a low probability of war. ﻿I reinforced the frontline in the Golan, ﻿deployed the 7th Brigade and artillery units there. ﻿Mazal tov! - Mazal tov! ﻿I would like to take this festive opportunity to inform you ﻿that the R&R scheduled in Acre, was cancelled. ﻿Oh. man! We're going to Eilat instead... ﻿Alright! Thank you. If you don't pack a bathing suit. It's patrol duty, back at base for you. ﻿Leibo is responsible for the entertainment... ﻿I want you to sit by the phone all through the holiday. ﻿Victor, come on... - Nurit. If I'm staying home, ﻿then you can. too; If something comes up. I'll come get you. Oh, alright. I'll leave a message with my Mum if I go to the beach. ﻿How will I find you on the beach? ﻿Ask the lifeguard to call for you On the loudspeaker? ﻿Stay by the phone for the entire holiday, please! ﻿Happy new year! Cheers! - Cheers! ﻿Come by for a visit on Saturday night. ﻿It's a new grill from the States, it's just amazing 27th to 29th was the Jewish New Year holiday. Prime Minister Golda Meir spent the holiday at Kibbutz Revivim. ﻿Totally high-tech. The skewers rotate all by themselves! ﻿You can grill fish, eggplant... It's just amazing. Minister of Defence, Moshe Dayan, was at his home in Tzhala. Chief of Staff, David Elazar, was on vacation in Sharem-a-Sheikh. ﻿What do you say? I'll come if Gabai will. ﻿So we can have ourselves some heated discussions... Sunday, 30th of September 1973, 6 days before Yom Kippur ﻿The Voice of Israel from Jerusalem. Good day. ﻿This newscast is read by Hayuta Dvir. ﻿"Vote for them, so they can vouch for you" ﻿Israeli Prime. Minister. Mrs. Golda Meir, ﻿arrived today in France, where she will address the European Union. ﻿Prior to her departure, she advised the Austrian Chancellor ﻿not to accept the terrorists' demand, to close down ﻿the transit camp for Jewish emigrants-from the USSR, ﻿in return for the release of hostages. Good morning, Gabai. - Good morning, Avram. ﻿What's wrong with the bike rack? - It's not good here? ﻿No, it's not good. ﻿Why aren't you wearing a belt? ﻿23 parties with run for elections. ﻿Prime Minister Meir has decided to prolong her visit in Europe... ﻿Good morning. ﻿Good morning. ﻿How was the holiday? - Just dandy. ﻿El Ahram. Good. ﻿What’s this? ﻿Haim, why isn't my mail on my desk? ﻿Coming right up. ﻿Read Sadat's speech to parliament: it's interestingly moderate. ﻿He doesn't even use the word "war". ﻿I see you had a good Arabic teacher in your fancy school. The beach was so much fun... ﻿Good morning. - Good morning, Haim. ﻿Haim? - Yes? ﻿Why hasn't this been brought to my attention until now? ﻿What do you mean? - Have you read this? ﻿The Egyptian Navy was put on alert! ﻿Ask the duty officer, he didn't think it was urgent. ﻿Victor, Head of Intelligence wants you ASAP! ﻿Do you know what he wants? On Wednesday morning, 11:48 hours. ﻿you phoned Southern Command Intelligence Officer ﻿and reported what King Hussein had relayed to the Prime Minister. ﻿You knew that this was classified. ﻿I did not reveal the source. Sir. ﻿You cannot give your estimates? You have a department, ﻿which has a head of department. and he alone issues statements. ﻿Sir. I did not issue an estimate. I relayed the information ﻿thought Southern Command, had to be in the loop. ﻿Do you realise that you're in the Army? ﻿The General decides on who should be in the loop ﻿I'll let you off with a reprimand, this time. ﻿It'll go on your personal record, and if this happens again. ﻿I'll send you flying out of here. ﻿Yes. Sir. - Thank you for your time. ﻿Sir... ﻿I would like to point out something to you. if I may. ﻿Over the past few days, we have gotten various reports. ﻿from various sources... And I agree, that Egypt is not ready for war... ﻿Your point? ﻿This morning, the Egyptian Navy was put on alert. ﻿and mine clearing efforts have been initiated ﻿in the Canal area. ﻿These reports, in conjunction with Hussein's warning. ﻿require us, in my opinion, to rethink our estimate. Let's rethink our estimate. ﻿Have you read the World Bank's Annual report? ﻿If you'll read it. you'll see what commercial deficit Egypt has. ﻿and realise that after 5 days of fighting they'll go bankrupt. ﻿Who will they turn to for financial aid? To whom? ﻿According to the same report. Russia has even bigger problems. ﻿On the other hand, Hassanein Heikal wrote in his editorial ﻿in El-Ahram last Saturday, that each and every Egyptian ﻿will starve to death for Sinai... - Anwar Sadat, too... ﻿read the World Bank's annual report, he knows very well ﻿that should he start a war. Egypt's economy would collapse. ﻿and he would be thrown from power. ﻿Prime Minister Meir has decided to prolong her visit in Europe. ﻿in light of the demand made by the Austrian chancellor... ﻿May I? ﻿What is it? ﻿Look, Amram, we have some issues here that are not being looked into. ﻿You yourself demand that we try to refute our basic assumptions. ﻿I'm not excluding any option, Gabai, but when you prepare ﻿a refuting assumption, you must be well-prepared to defend it. Instead of going over my head like a coward, ﻿I find that I'm well-prepared to refute your assumption ﻿with raw reports, but you automatically discard them ﻿for some indisputable axiom. - You can't work without axioms! ﻿Intelligence research is science, and as such must use axioms! ﻿As long as they are corroborated by facts! ﻿They are all corroborated. ﻿But also evaluated according to the political situation. ﻿tactical possibilities and balance of power... ﻿An air recon mission hasn't been flown in 5 days now! ﻿This is no time to try to stretch a buck! ﻿Why aren't the "special devices" working? ﻿We're not going to "burn" the "special devices". ﻿and put pilots at risk because of Hussein's unreliable sources! ﻿We don't know enough, Amram. - We know all we need to know. ﻿As you see, we have clearer information concerning ﻿the Tachrir-41 exercise, in which the Egyptians are engaged. ﻿It involves two Armies and peripheral forces. ﻿Now, on the Syrian front... ﻿The Syrians, too, are deployed in emergency formation. ﻿The CIA warned us of a possible Syrian strike. We know the source. ﻿Our sources indicate otherwise. - If the Syrians won't strike, ﻿why are they deploying in emergency formation? ﻿I believe it's because we shot down those MiGs... ﻿I very much doubt that the Syrians won't strike. ﻿They have greatly replenished their armour lately, ﻿and bridging equipment, as well as surface-to-air missiles. ﻿Our estimate that they feel they're not prepared is void. ﻿I believe they will strike, and we must prepare for it. ﻿I think we should reinforce the line with one tank brigade ﻿and one artillery battalion. Where would we get a brigade? ﻿We have to call up reserves. We're not calling up reserves. ﻿I'm willing to send two tank companies of the 7th Brigade. ﻿We’ll have 113 tanks there, which is more than enough! ﻿We can't yo-yo this country around. ﻿We called up reserves last May for no reason. It cost a fortune. ﻿But still, Sir, it remains unclear to me: ﻿what made you think that such reinforcement would suffice ﻿in holding back two entire tank divisions? ﻿It was entirely reasonable, Sir. We had clear technical superiority, ﻿which was meticulously calculated, but our defensive doctrine ﻿requires 48 hours in advance for calling up the reserves. ﻿We did not receive such warning, and our superiority was negated. ﻿Yes? - Is that my wife? ﻿Yes, we'll be right there. ﻿A Mossad agent reports that the Egyptian exercise manoeuvrer ﻿scheduled for tomorrow will end in the fording of the Canal. ﻿The Syrians will attack in conjunction. ﻿Source reliable? ﻿Fairly reliable, but we have no corroborating reports, ﻿either from radio surveillance, or from visual intelligence. ﻿Maybe at Air Force Intelligence they know something. ﻿The Egyptians couldn't strike without their Air Force. ﻿I've talked to them. I'm waiting for their answer. On 30th of September I attended ﻿a European Union convention in Strasbourg. ﻿I wasn’t informed of a warning stating that the Egyptian exercise ﻿was a smokescreen for the fording of the Canal. ﻿Had I been informed, I would have cut short my visit to Europe... and headed back to Israel. ﻿A million troops can't prepare for war without any leaks. ﻿Not to us, not to the Americans... - A million German soldiers ﻿didn't know they were going to invade Russia in 1942. Unlike us, the Russians didn't have coverage ﻿on the division commanders! ﻿Yes. This is he. ﻿Yes. ﻿Nothing? Nothing at all? ﻿Alright then. Thank you. ﻿If Air Force intelligence have no word, then it's just an exercise. ﻿Mini, could you file this report, please? I don't understand you, Amram. Here's a report, that’s contrary ﻿to our basic assumptions. Instead of checking it, ﻿you refute it, using other reports that support our assumptions? ﻿Is this the way to go about it? ﻿Maybe the Egyptian Air Force is performing disinformation? ﻿If Egyptian aircraft aren't being fuelled-up, armed ﻿and redeployed in the east, then there's no war, period. ﻿Sir, what did you do with the 30th of September report? ﻿It was "buried" on the same day. After the war, it became clear ﻿that it was absolutely accurate. ﻿I believe this was because of Zeira's deep influence on Dayan. ﻿When Dayan was Chief of Staff, Zeira had been his adjutant. ﻿A special trust was formed between them back then. ﻿He knew Dayan would appoint him to be the next Chief of Staff. ﻿Why didn't you address the issue in front of the Prime Minister? ﻿I tried. ﻿But these were hard times for the Mossad. ﻿Our credibility suffered greatly, by our failure in Lillehammer, ﻿while Zeira's status gained from the fact ﻿that he alone estimated that the Arabs wouldn't attack in May ﻿and indeed they didn't. ﻿Hello? ﻿Aha. ﻿Yes. ﻿No, you know how I feel about human intelligence - unreliable. ﻿This is no ordinary report. Should I handle it as top priority? ﻿No, no... - Not even to the Chief of Staff? ﻿Come on, it's 2 o'clock. He's got a long day ahead of him. ﻿No. No. Good night. ﻿Voice of Israel, Jerusalem. Good day. ﻿This news edition is read by Hayuta Dvir. ﻿Israeli Prime Minister, Mrs. Golda Meir, ﻿arrived today in France, where she will address the European Union. ﻿We got an interesting report. - Oh? What about? ﻿Good morning, Sir. Good morning, Rosa. How are you? ﻿Tell me when your son gets married. - Of course I will! ﻿Mossad warned about war breaking out this morning. ﻿Of course. I took it upon myself to corroborate ﻿before involving you. - Good show. ﻿I hope this will be the end of all of these "warnings". ﻿Why wasn't I informed of the Mossad's report? ﻿Why am I only hearing about it now? ﻿We received the warning at 02:30. It was preliminary. ﻿We had to corroborate it, estimate its credibility, ﻿and by morning we established that it was unfounded. ﻿You can't make these decisions. - But if it's an unfounded report. ﻿There's no sense in alarming everybody in the dead of night. It can wait for morning briefing. ﻿Southern Command, Intelligence Officer, please. ﻿Major Gabai. ﻿Victor! Gedalia, good morning. ﻿Listen, last night we received a report stating that the exercise ﻿is a smokescreen for a strike, scheduled for today or tomorrow. ﻿Yes. I’m calling you because the air mission was cancelled. ﻿I have no indication of what's going on there! ﻿But you have observers, don't you? ﻿They must be picking up on something! ﻿So tell them to open their eyes. That's what I'm saying ﻿Gedalia? Agree with the Military Intelligence estimate. ﻿It's improbable that the Syrians would invade on their own. ﻿We may even suffer civilian casualties near the border, ﻿but the end result would be a disaster for the Syrians. ﻿We’d annihilate their armed forces within 48 hours ﻿and they know it. The 179th brigade has just concluded ﻿a mobilisation drill. I suggest we keep them in uniform. Fine, keep one battalion. - Hello. No. ﻿First I've heard of it. ﻿We deployed 20 tanks from the Seventh Brigade yesterday. ﻿Eli, did you issue a warning, on war with Egypt this morning? ﻿No, we actually estimated there wouldn't be a war. ﻿My intelligence officer told me he received warning from your guys. ﻿I'll look into it. - By the way, Eli, ﻿are the "special devices" in the Canal working? ﻿Of course. "Special Devices" are advanced communication devices planted in enemy territory by Israeli Military Intelligence. They are meant to be﻿ operational in emergency situations only, because when operational, they are susceptible to detection. ﻿I was convinced that our "specials devices" were active ﻿and detecting nothing. ﻿Minister of Defence was also under that impression. ﻿They would have divulged the Egyptian military preparation. ﻿I don't accept the estimate that Military Intelligence ﻿deliberately deceived. ﻿That's just not true. ﻿I've heard what you think, you've said so for the last week! ﻿Every day! And I never told you to quash it! ﻿But we are all committed to this department's estimate! ﻿I only... - Wait! ﻿You will not sit here another minute unless you take that in ﻿I've just relayed the information. - Without my say-so! ﻿Throughout April and May you cried "war" up to high heavens ﻿and I was the only one who maintained "low probability". ﻿And I was right! - Amram, ﻿we were given a report warning of war. ﻿This is no ordinary report. ﻿The aerial reconnaissance mission was cancelled. ﻿I don't have any up-to-date aerial photos. So I asked ﻿Southern Command Intelligence Officer to report to me. ﻿It seemed the natural thing to do, so what's the big deal? ﻿The big deal is that you disobeyed my orders! The General of Southern Command ﻿is demanding that we get our act together! ﻿So what will we do Gabai? ﻿Tell him he's out of here. If he was reprimanded yesterday ﻿and commits the same offence again today. I don't want him. ﻿Tell him he's out of the corps by the end of the month. Get someone from the academy to learn the ropes starting Sunday. ﻿Would you happen to have an aspirin? I think I have a cold. ﻿In the Port Said area, 25 vehicles were identified ﻿transporting bridging and fording apparatus, period. ﻿And this year Egyptian officers will go to Mecca, too, period. ﻿We conclude that the Egyptian Army is maintaining the routine... ﻿Good morning, Amram. ﻿I want an urgent meeting with the Major-General. ﻿Didn't you read his letter? ﻿I still want a meeting with him. - His decision is final, Gabai. ﻿That's not why I want the meeting. I want to discuss our estimate. ﻿Gabai, yesterday he threw you out. Do you think he wants a meeting? ﻿This is not a private meeting, Amram. ﻿I'm still the Section Head. ﻿OK, I'm meeting him at 09:15. You wait outside his office. Thank you. ﻿No, he'll come at 4 o'clock, then he'll inspect the troops. ﻿At 1620 hours he'll meet the officers till 5 o'clock. ﻿No, he'll be there at 4 o'clock, and only then, the inspection. ﻿At 1620 hours he'll meet the officer's until 5 o’clock. ﻿Before the inspection of the base, you will serve him refreshments. ﻿Yes, light refreshments. Good-bye. ﻿This time he missed, but clearly there was a foul... ﻿No, I can't put you through, he's is in a meeting right how. ﻿Anyway, call up all bureau personnel. They're on call. ﻿Fine. I'll give the stenographer the final draft. Give me an hour. ﻿Hang on a second. ﻿Why don't you go home? ﻿You don't look so good. ﻿I don't know what's wrong. I never get sick... ﻿Let's go over the report we received from the CIA again. ﻿Their arguments are just too familiar, too much like ours. ﻿Tomorrow. Yes. Goodbye. ﻿Amram, we'll get going at 3 o'clock... ﻿The Egyptian officers will visit Mecca in 2 weeks. ﻿That's the best proof there is that this is just an exercise. ﻿Maybe it's disinformation? Sadat announced just yesterday ﻿that he will travel to New York to speak before the UN assembly. ﻿He wouldn't have travelled if he wanted to start a war. ﻿'Maybe that's disinformation, too? ﻿He's under the hoop, he ties it: 30/30! ﻿Sorry. I totally forgot. ﻿Sorry, Gabai. He's done for the day. ﻿He's got a cabinet meeting first thing tomorrow morning. ﻿No... No. negative. ﻿I get off in 5 days... ﻿No, I can't. We’ll be off next week. ﻿There you go. ﻿Just exercises. ﻿They're letting the reserves go on the 8th of October. Same as always. ﻿Second and Third Armies. ﻿"Ha'aretz" ﻿"Kreisky has decided to close down transit camp." ﻿"Despite Egyptian alert: all is quiet in the Canal area" ﻿I wish to-open this meeting was caller-only yesterday ﻿and I haven't got the chance to be brought up to speed. I was very concerned during the flight back. ﻿Please begin, Moshe. I called this urgent meeting because of the Arab redeployment. ﻿Mostly in Syria, but in Egypt as well. ﻿We must figure out why it is done, and how to confront it. ﻿Found it! Let him say that these are exercises. Last year we hardly intercepted ﻿any radio conversations, as opposed to other years. How's that for a flashing signal... ﻿How many calls were made last year? ﻿The Syrian Army is in emergency deployment. ﻿they brought up two squadrons to forward airfields. ﻿They have moved tanks and artillery to the front, ﻿but mainly they just reinforced anti-aircraft batteries. ﻿I must emphasise that the latter are not protecting Damascus, ﻿but the Golan Heights line. This is not a defensive deployment. It's an offensive deployment. ﻿On the 14th of September we intercepted 2,080 radio conversations. ﻿On the 15th we intercepted 3,099... ﻿2,440 on the 16th and 3,100 on the 17th. ﻿I rest my case. Just look at this year's data. ﻿October, ﻿42 radio conversations... ﻿2nd October: ﻿54 radio conversations. ﻿Today: ﻿Only 20 conversations. ﻿I agree with Eli - a joint Syrian Egyptian strike is improbable. ﻿Having said that, we must take into consideration ﻿that the Syrians are capable of striking very rapidly, ﻿mostly owing to their confidence in their surface-to-air missiles. ﻿Then, how do we deploy on the Syrian front? ﻿We've reinforced the front with Syria. We have over a 100 tanks. ﻿If they start something, we'll know about it. ﻿When a large machine starts rolling, it makes quite a racket. ﻿And if the Egyptians strike? ﻿Won't the Syrians join them? - The Egyptians won't strike, ﻿because if they attack with tanks, ﻿they would be cut off from their AA pieces, twisting in the wind. ﻿The Egyptians are not preparing for war. Madam. ﻿They are preparing for exercises that will end on the eighth. ﻿then they will release all of their reserves... ﻿A week later, the entire Officer Corps will visit Mecca. ﻿No. I was not summoned to that meeting, and for a reason. ﻿The person who called the meeting didn't like hearing my estimates. ﻿I don't presume to have said that war was imminent, ﻿but I did argue that the odds were high ﻿and that appropriate steps had to betaken. ﻿I believe the situation is clear. I was very concerned. Thank you. You set my mind at ease. ﻿What did you do after you learned that you weren't summoned? ﻿I asked the PM to listen to my own estimate. ﻿She directed me to the Minister of Defence, who listened to it, ﻿but said that Zeira holds a different view. ﻿I told him that there were actual facts to be noticed. ﻿He said I could go "take a hike!". ﻿"News Edition" ﻿Good Evening. ﻿Today we've covered Minister of Defence's visit to the Golan. ﻿We shot down 13 Syrian MiGs two weeks ago... ﻿Sir, Major Gabai would like to see you. ﻿Send him in. ﻿Fix your self up. You know he hates it. ﻿"I hope Syria understands that any sort of provocation"... ﻿I apologise for the late hour. Colonel Richter's out ﻿and, we've just received visual intelligence from the Canal. ﻿It seemed urgent. The Egyptians are breaching their embankment. ﻿What do you deduce from these reports, Gabai? I deduce that they are enabling the passage of tanks. ﻿What will become of these tanks once they’ve crossed over? ﻿Will they have air support and anti-aircraft support? They'd be rolling right into a deathtrap. ﻿The only plausible explanation ﻿is that the breaches are part of the exercise. Night. Gabai. ﻿He's right. There aren't enough breaches for fording. ﻿It's still exercise. - They would have made one, ﻿maybe two, but not 20! Not 20 breaches! ﻿And why de-mine the strip? Answer me! Why? ﻿History's full of surprise attacks that started off as exercises. ﻿5 years ago, the Russians conquered Prague that way. Thursday, 4 October 1973 2 days before Yom Kippur ﻿Shlomi, come see what's going on in the Suez Canal. Air Force Aerial Photo Deciphering Center, 10:00 hours ﻿This wasn't here last week. - Menahem! Look, the Canal is full of tanks! ﻿"Third Army" ﻿I don't believe it! ﻿The ramparts are full of tanks. ﻿Look at this! ﻿Bridges, rafts, boats. Just look! ﻿7 additional artillery battalions were deployed in Ismailiya. - Where? ﻿I'll be damned... ﻿an additional tank brigade at Suez. ﻿2 battalions here and a tank-destroyer battalion. ﻿Why are they doing this? Are they out of their minds? ﻿Maybe this year they're involving additional field units in exercise. ﻿Negative, he's not here.. ﻿I don't know, all the Russians beat it this afternoon. ﻿I'm alone here, waiting for radio operators from Ismailiya. ﻿Roger, this is One, over. Russians are leaving by bus. ﻿Yes, civilians, too. Heading for airport, over. ﻿Come to my office, and bring Gabai and Leibo. ﻿This is just insane, first time they're involving so many units. ﻿And it's the first time that a bridging battalion is involved. ﻿We received a report from 848. ﻿Russian advisors are being evacuated. ﻿Where from? - Both Egypt and Syria. ﻿They're running an emergency freight line. - Families, too? ﻿Everyone. They were given 2 hours to pack up and get to the airport. ﻿What does this mean? ﻿Well, they did expel the Russian advisors last year as well. ﻿because of the diplomatic crisis they've had. ﻿Maybe it's because the arms didn't arrive on time to Syria. ﻿Maybe Assad's had it with them. ﻿Could they be fearing an Israeli attack? ﻿An Israeli attack? ﻿The Syrians are watching our actions. They know ﻿we've declared alert in Sinai; they know the 7th Brigade is up north ﻿and the Air Force is on alert... They're watching the Arabs, too. ﻿They know Syria and Egypt are assuming attack deployment... ﻿the Egyptian Army won't strike. ﻿it's been preparing exercises for the past 2 weeks. ﻿Let's exclude the prospect of war... ﻿Could there have been a sudden political crisis ﻿between Syria and Russia and Egypt and Russia? ﻿Sir... - Just a minute... ﻿An air recon mission was flown this morning. ﻿You saw the report.. If we examine the redeployment... ﻿The redeployment is a result of the exercise manoeuvrers! ﻿I don't believe they're preparing for exercises. Sir. ﻿I want to discuss the possibility of a diplomatic crisis. Gabai. ﻿The Russians advisors were evaluated hastily. ﻿They weren't given time to pack up! That's very telling. ﻿Gabai... ﻿Could this crisis be the result... Aerials show they moved tanks. ﻿bridging battalions, boats; their artillery is in forward position. ﻿their advancing supplies and ammunition! - Gabai I'm warning you. ﻿Check the Russian debt refunds... - Mossad is releasing warnings. ﻿The Americans are releasing warnings. Hussein warns ﻿of a Syrian-Egyptian strike... - Get out of here, Gabai. ﻿Tomorrow or the next day there will be a war, Sir. ﻿We're not prepared for it. - Get out! ﻿Let us work, get out. You too. ﻿There's no proof that they are preparing for war. ﻿Of course there isn't. ﻿I suppose we'll know more by tomorrow. ﻿If there's a political crisis, we'll have indication. ﻿I'll report as soon as I get additional information. ﻿Thank you. - Leibo went home already. ﻿He said he would talk to you in the morning. ﻿Aren't you going home? ﻿No. ﻿Do you need me here? War will break out tomorrow. ﻿It all adds up. ﻿The frontline is full of soldiers. ﻿By tomorrow or the next day, they will be all killed. ﻿Every last one of them. ﻿Would you like me to fix you a cup of coffee? ﻿Why not. ﻿Zvika, Eli Zeira here. You up? ﻿From Syria and Egypt? ﻿Families and all? - Yes, but why? ﻿Do you know of any political crisis or anything like that? ﻿At any rate, it means that the probability for war is higher. ﻿This evacuation does relate to one other thing. ﻿I've received an urgent report from "Bavel". That's what he said: "War"? ﻿I'm flying over to Paris to meet him. ﻿Alright. Keep me posted. ﻿Thank you. ﻿We had reports that the USSR has initiated an urgent evacuation ﻿of all of their military advisors in Syria and Egypt. ﻿We are unable to explain this. ﻿Of course the evacuation concerned me! ﻿They didn't even give them time to pack up! ﻿But the Head of Military Intelligence assured me ﻿that there would be no war. ﻿Madame, why didn't you call up reserves then and there? ﻿Because he and the Minister of Defence didn't demand it! ﻿Did you know why they didn't demand a call-up? ﻿Could it have been because of the financial cost? ﻿The upcoming elections? ﻿If I were a political analyst, I'd say they wouldn’t strike. ﻿But I'm Chief of Staff which is why this is irrelevant for me. ﻿What is relevant, is whether we are prepared for war. ﻿We declared Yellow Alert this morning; that means ﻿cancellation of all vacations in combat units, the Air Force ﻿and a cal-up of the entire mobilisation mechanism. ﻿This is the highest state of alert we have. We reinforced the Canal and the Golan with tanks. ﻿As soon as the Syrians and Egyptians will budge, ﻿we’ll get the reports from Eli and start the call-up. ﻿So, you are against calling up the reserves at this stage? ﻿We will call up reserves only upon receiving word from Eli. ﻿Only if they start mobilising, by the way. ﻿Are the "special devices" picking up on anything? ﻿No, all is quiet. ﻿What was I to think? ﻿That the Head of Military Intelligence was wrong too? ﻿And Chief of Staff, too? ﻿And Dayan and Bar-Lev, the former Chiefs of Staff? ﻿And Galili, and Alon? ﻿And Shimon Peres? That they were all wrong, but I was right? ﻿But why am I hearing about this so late? ﻿I was on call on New Year's, too! ﻿Why me, because I never speak up? ﻿You're right. I know. It's not my fault, Nehama. ﻿I'll get going soon, but I'm not alone here... ﻿I told my husband that I'm on my way back home! ﻿Will you shut the hell up? No, not you, Nehama. ﻿Nehama? ﻿We would like to wish our listeners an easy fast... ﻿Gabai, he's busy! Amram, I was just in Operations. ﻿They don't understand our Reports, and they don't read anything ﻿into the Russian evacuation... - Gabai, get out of here! ﻿What does this have to do with me? - I want you to omit ﻿the estimate paragraph from today's summary. ﻿Drop the estimate paragraph? - Give them raw intelligence. ﻿Let Head of Operations and Chief of Staff make up their own minds. ﻿We're not postmen, we're required to give our estimate. ﻿Amram, this past week we've been relaying reports ﻿with estimates that refute these very reports! ﻿We give calculated estimates based on these reports. ﻿Amram, when they read the words "low probability", they understand ﻿that they're not required to do anything! ﻿I will not omit the estimate from the summary ﻿and I will not make an estimate, which I do not believe in! ﻿Don't you understand the risk in issuing such an estimate? ﻿That's what I'm here for - to take risks! ﻿You're afraid to do it, to assume responsibility ﻿and that's why you want to change the estimate ﻿so that General Staff and area commanders ﻿will have to make it for you. And I will not go along with it! - This morning the Egyptians ﻿issued orders to cease the Ramadan Fast in the Canal area! Am I getting through to you? ﻿Maybe it's because they fear an Israeli attack. ﻿During the entire War of Attrition they had never issued such orders. ﻿Not during the first year... not during the second year ﻿and they had more reason to fear an Israeli attack back then! ﻿The fast was never cancelled, not once during my service! ﻿Alright. Fine, we won't give our estimate. Miri, send in the typist. ﻿Head of Military Intelligence will attend the cabinet meeting ﻿without an estimate. ﻿Put down another article: ﻿40. Although the Egyptian emergency deployment ﻿may be interpreted as an attack formation, comma ﻿"we know of no change..." ﻿"the Egyptian estimation..." ﻿"of the balance of power..." ﻿"between the Egyptian Army..." ﻿"And IDF." ﻿"Hence, we estimate..." ﻿"that the probability for war..." ﻿"is low..." ﻿Alright. I'll pass it on. Thank you. ﻿848 intercepted a transmission ﻿from the Libyan ambassador to Cairo. This is his report to Qaddafi that the Russians are evacuated, ﻿because the Syrians and Egyptians are planning to strike Israel. ﻿Well? ﻿Do you find the Libyan ambassador reliable? ﻿I think he's unreliable - he's a corrupt braggart. ﻿I've read his articles in El-Ahram. He's very intelligent. ﻿What possible interest would he have in deceiving Qaddafi? ﻿None. He's relaying what he knows, which is not true. ﻿There are two options. One: the advisors were evacuated ﻿to pressure the Arabs into... I suggest we hand this report ﻿"as is" to the Chief of Staff and Minister of Defence... ﻿We will do no such thing until we examine it thoroughly ﻿and find supporting reports. - The Canal is full of reports: ﻿Tanks, Artillery, Anti Aircraft... - He knows this, and has acted. ﻿There's nothing else to do because it has all been done! ﻿Why not let him make up his own mind, for once? ﻿I'm telling you, there's nothing to be done, and there's no sense ﻿in taking this nonsense seriously. - "Nonsense"? ﻿I swear I don't know what's going on here. ﻿They're going to strike tomorrow. ﻿The Chief of Staff doesn't know it, so he's not calling up reserves. ﻿The Egyptians will strike with aircraft, ﻿with armour, with artillery - they'll ford the Canal. ﻿They'll attack the strongholds - they'll just roll on with ease ﻿and the Syrians will reach the Sea of Galilee! ﻿Don't you see what I see? We see everything, Gabai. OK? ﻿Get out. Let us work. ﻿I can't relate to this panic. It's just so uncalled for. ﻿We are here to prevent panic so that every citizen in this country can live in peace. ﻿I've built a truly extraordinary intelligence-gathering apparatus ﻿capable of analysis and assessment. ﻿A high-tech, modern, state-of-the-art apparatus ﻿based on logic. It's the best in the world. ﻿I could easily write that there's a very high probability for war. ﻿It's just one line in the intelligence summary. ﻿But it's not true, and that's why it won't leave this office. ﻿I have no intention of standing, in a week's time, ﻿in front of the PM and apologise for my mistake. ﻿Scared my fever off, didn't I... ﻿There's just no need for panic. ﻿We won't relay the report till Zamir brings us up to speed. ﻿Besides, the Chief of Staff has done all he could ﻿even if this report is true, but I'm positive it is not. ﻿The Army is on Yellow Alert. Air Force called up all pilots. ﻿We reinforced the frontlines, and this Army is prepared. ﻿The soldiers' fingers are on the triggers. ﻿As for the "special devices"... you might as well activate them ﻿though I'm certain we won't pick up anything. ﻿I stayed in my office until 21:00. The other generals ﻿stayed in theirs until 19:00. We had all the time-in the world. ﻿I went home feeling I had done all that was supposed to be done. ﻿I had no idea that one floor up, lay a warning I had not seen. ﻿Had I read the report at 17:00, even at 18:00. ﻿I would have ordered an immediate call-up of reserves. ﻿If we had called up the troops on Yom Kippur Eve ﻿they'd have reached the frontier before the Syrians, opened fire ﻿and they wouldn't have broken through our defence. ﻿Though Southern Command Reserves had not made it in time ﻿to the Canal, they would've been dispatched in an orderly fashion, ﻿not running off to war like cartoon characters on tanks, ﻿riding on their tracks, with virtually no ammunition! ﻿Besides, I had the entire night for the regular Army units. ﻿I would've dropped a parachute brigade down to the strongholds, ﻿deployed 13 artillery batteries in the Canal area - ﻿the regular Sinai Division would have been advanced, so the Egyptians might've forded the Canal in between strongholds, ﻿but not all along the frontline. ﻿Not without suffering casualties. ﻿Like in some military parade. ﻿I would like a clear answer: was "Bavel" a reliable source, or wasn't he? ﻿He had been working with us for 4 years, and his reports ﻿had been relayed regularly to the PM and the Deputy PM, ﻿to the Minister of Defence and to the Chief of Staff. ﻿Thanks to the importance of his reports, ﻿we ran repeated verifications to see whether he was working ﻿for other foreign agencies and nothing came up. ﻿Freddie, listen up, this is urgent! ﻿Do you hear me? Freddie? Freddie! ﻿Yes. ﻿﻿Yes. ﻿I see. ﻿Call up the entire staff. I want them all on call. ﻿Tell him I want to see him. - Give him a minute. ﻿I want to see him now, as in right this minute! ﻿Sir, it's Gabai. He wants to see you. Says it's urgent. ﻿Let me talk to him. - Give him a couple of minutes! ﻿Tell him to activate the "special devices". ﻿They've been active since yesterday. ﻿Idiots... ﻿I want the entire four division reserve force and peripherals. ﻿On what basis? Some report Zvika brought this morning? ﻿This is a reason to initiate a call-up? ﻿It might convince the Arabs to withdraw their forces. ﻿Or it could backfire, and they'll get panicky and strike to pre-empt. I need one division down south ﻿and one up north for defensive battle. An independent division, and another one for a counter-attack. ﻿Reserves for a counter-attack in an imaginary war? ﻿Do you understand the political ramifications of such a call-up ﻿and on Yom Kippur, no less? ﻿What do you suggest I draft? ﻿Sinai will do with 300 tanks. ﻿I authorise another tank brigade for the Golan Heights. ﻿I cannot agree to that. They'll wash over us. Let the PM decide on it. I oppose a pre-emptive aerial strike. ﻿If we strike first, we will lose the American support. ﻿As for the call-up, I think we should call up a small ﻿defensive force - 50 to 60 thousand soldiers. ﻿If things heat up, we'll call up the rest. Will that do? - No. Ma'am, it will not do! We must mobilise all of our troops to counter-attack ﻿and we must launch a pre-emptive aerial strike ﻿within the next few hours, or we will suffer casualties. ﻿I'm with Moshe on the issue of the pre-emptive strike. ﻿It's politically impossible. ﻿Now, about the reserves. How well do we know what's going on with the enemy? ﻿They are capable of launching, a coordinated strike, ﻿though I don't believe they will. ﻿Madam, you must make up your mind, time is running out! ﻿The Americans report that all is quiet. No sense in a call-up. ﻿Madam... ﻿I'm inclined to agree with the Chief of Staff. ﻿Call up 4 divisions. - Tell Talik to go ahead. ﻿I'm not going to lie down in the middle of the road to stop this. But tell me, will it fit the Arabs to sit tight when we release ﻿all the reserves you're drafting? - As soon as the threat is gone. ﻿And if the Arabs don't strike? They'll be home within 48 hours. ﻿So you'll have 100,000 men just walking around there? ﻿They won't be walking around, they'll hold the frontline, ﻿objected to the pre-emptive strike for political reasons. ﻿I had hoped that the war could be prevented. ﻿How could it have been prevented? ﻿We had a few hours, but it was night time in America. ﻿There was no one there. I had opted to wait till morning ﻿and ask the Americans to speak with the Russians. ﻿It's just unbelievable. ﻿Inconceivable! I told the PM and the Minister of Defence that ﻿"Ravel" is an unreliable source. He could even be a double agent. ﻿His eagerness to work for us always seemed fishy to me. ﻿He might be working for Egyptian Intelligence, too. ﻿He has alerted us twice this year alone ﻿and twice nothing happened. ﻿The Egyptians are using "Ravel" as a pipeline for disinformation ﻿to check our response and to make us initiate call-ups ﻿every three months, so that we'll destroy our economy! Let's look into this. ﻿According to reports we got the war will start at 18:00. ﻿Why weren't we informed of this? - This is an outrage! ﻿This is unacceptable... ﻿What's that? ﻿No. I can't put you through, he's in a meeting. ﻿Yes, try calling again in 10 minutes. In 5 then! ﻿Yes. I'll put you right through. ﻿Sir, the Minister of Defence is calling. ﻿Sir. ﻿Sir, the Minister of Defence is on the line! Sir! ﻿Sir, we have to issue a new intelligence summary. We have to issue an update regarding their war objectives. Tell them to come in... ﻿in 3 minutes. ﻿Yes, Sir. The IDF was caught unprepared in the Yom Kippur war, and took a hard beating from Syrians and the Egyptians. By the end of the war, IDF suffered 2,656 Dead, 7,251 wounded, 301 POWs and 17 MIAs. The war exposed many failures and shook the Israeli society. The Agranat Committee blamed the Army for the failures, almost totally exonerating the leadership. The committee's findings remain controversial to this day.
