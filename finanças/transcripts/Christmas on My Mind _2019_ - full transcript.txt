[♪♪♪] Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! It's the most wonderful time of the year! Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Ho, ho, ho! [woman] Sorry. Sorry. [Santa] Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Be careful, Miss. It's slippery out. [crash] [Santa, faintly] Are you okay, Miss? Miss, are you okay? Are you okay, Miss? Where am I? The North Pole. Sorry. I couldn't resist. Portland. Oregon? Maine. I'm not in Bedford Harbor? I'm afraid not, no. You know, you came running through here awfully fast. I... I hope you weren't very late for your wedding? What? No, I don't-- I don't think so... What day is it? December 17th. December 17th... I get married this week. Where's my phone? I have to get home. You hit your head. You know, you might want to get that checked out. No, no, no, no, no. I'm fine, really. I just-- I need to find my fiancé. Thank you, Santa. Merry Christmas! Taxi! Good luck, Ma'am. Be careful! Thank you. Bedford Harbor, please! [♪♪♪] Oh, hey, did you get the change on table four? Okay, thanks. [man] Hey! Christmas is eight days away and you still haven't gotten your tree? Oh, come on, man. I've been busy. And look at the place. Look at all the decorations I have. You're my big brother, and I run a Christmas Tree Farm, so you have no excuse. Like zero. So does that mean I get the family discount? Maybe. Hey, speaking of family-- Are you going to volunteer at the Bedford Christmas Festival, right? Oh, man. I'll do my best, but it's all week. I can't just take every night off. It would mean a lot to Mom. And it would mean a lot to my customers if I kept this place open. You know, you were a lot more fun when you used to wear that ugly Christmas sweater to work. You know, I can't find that thing anywhere. What? No. I don't know what happened to it. Regardless, I'm still fun. Except I'm just-- I'm a busy and respectable restaurateur now. Who I'm sure could find someone to cover for you. - You volunteering? - Me? - Yeah. - I'm just here eating lunch. Well, family discount doesn't mean free. I'll remember that when you finally come get your tree. But I-- I do my own dishes here, okay? That's the least you can do. [♪♪♪] Thank you so much. Zach... you are never going to believe the day I had! I lost my phone, so I couldn't call you, but I got my dress, so we are good to go. Um... Lucy, what are you-- What are you doing? Oh, my gosh. Just pretend you didn't see that. No, I mean what are you doing here? Are you guys busy? Lucy! Beau, you cut your hair? Yeah. - I mean, I always liked it before, but this-- This suits you. I mean, I guess it makes sense, right? Cutting it for the wedding. What wedding? Our wedding? Lucy... we're not engaged anymore. Okay, stop being silly. We're getting married this week. We broke up two years ago. We broke up? Yeah. No, I don't... I don't understand. Why am I carrying a wedding dress? I have no idea. I'm sorry. You look great by the way. The suit-- It really brings out your eyes. - It's black. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's just makes the pupils pop. Which, actually, by the way, look really large right now. Are you okay, Lucy? [Zach] Lucy... Lucy! Okay... Lucy, how are you feeling? Zach, you're here. What's going on? You fainted. Because we broke up? Uh, Dr. Albright-- She's running some tests. She'll be back any minute with the results, but, um... you hit your head. That's what Santa said. Not the real Santa. I hope you don't mind, but your wallet was in your purse. I didn't snoop, but I found this. You run your Aunt Audrey's Art Foundation in Portland. You remember? Yeah, I remember I was supposed to take over when my Aunt Audrey passed... Right... she passed away. [Dr. Albright] Well, look who's awake. It's good to see you again, Lucy. It's been a while. Um... yeah, it's good to see you again, Doctor... Albright. Dr. Albright, right. Well, I have some good news. Got your scans back. They came back clear. Just a bump on the head-- No concussion. That's-- That's great news. But I still have some questions I'd like to ask-- If that's all right? Sure. What day is it? Tuesday-- Thursday? What did you have for breakfast? Eggnog waffles. I think. I make really good eggnog waffles. [Dr. Albright] I'm sure you do. Any family? No. Just me. - Right. Let's try this one. What's the last thing you remember? I'm at the Bedford Christmas Festival. It's a couple days till Christmas. Carolers are singing, and twinkly lights are glowing. I'm drinking hot chocolate, and I'm with Zach. Do you remember what year that was? [Lucy] This year? That was two Christmases ago. [Dr. Albright] Okay, we're getting somewhere. Now, where did you work when you lived in Bedford Harbor? The Community Center. I ran the Kids Art Education Program. - I know that's correct. You used to teach my Katie. Your granddaughter... I remember! She is so cute... and talented. She just turned 11. Wow. I... How can I remember stuff from two years ago, but I can't remember anything recent? We call it retrograde amnesia-- A person is unable to remember the events just before the onset of the amnesia-- But I wouldn't worry about it too much. In most cases, the memories return. But I'd advise you just take it easy for the next few days. Do you have someone that can drive you home? I can... I can drive you home. [Dr. Albright] Great. Great. I want you to schedule a follow-up for later this week. A follow-up... here? [Dr. Albright] Yeah, well, if you're not able to get back here, then your doctor in Portland-- That's fine, but I want us to stay on top of this, okay? Here are your things. Now, be careful, your ring is in that bag. Thank you, Dr. Albright. I don't remember where I live. Your wallet also had your driver's license, so... we have your address. Great. I'll let you get dressed. - Okay. - Okay. [♪♪♪] So, you're wearing suits now? Yeah. I guess so... It kind of suits you... Are we going to joke about my suit? It's better than talking about the wedding dress, right? I mean, you're obviously getting married to somebody. I don't know. I mean, in my mind, I'm still marrying you. I called Anna Hepburn. She's your Communications Manager. There was a picture of the two of you on your Foundation website. She's gonna meet us at your house. Oh, great. Thank you. No problem. You know, we still have a few minutes before we get there, so you can rest up if you like. [Lucy] This can't be the right house. [Zach] This is the address from your licence. Here, I'll get your dress for you. [Lucy] Thank you. Lucy, I'm so glad you're okay. Hi. I'm sorry. What's your name again? I'm Anna. We work together. You left me a spare key just in case of emergencies. Okay. - You must be Zach. - Nice to meet you. Thank you for calling me. No problem. Welcome home. I live here? Yeah. Did I hang these decorations? No, no. We got our decorator do it, just like last year. But I have homemade decorations. You do? You always seemed to like how they decorated your place. Okay, let me get this straight. You hit your head, and now you don't remember anything? I can't remember anything from the past two years. Including me? I'm so sorry. You seem really nice. [Anna] You do remember Brad, though, right? Brad? Your fiancé? [Brad] Lucy. There you are. How are you feeling? You don't remember me? I'm so sorry. The doctor told us that it should only be temporary. "Us"? Hi. I'm Zach Callahan. Lucy and I, we were... we go way back. Brad Morgan. Lucy's fiancé. I'm so glad you're okay. I was worried sick. I have your... I have your phone. How do you have my phone? The bridal shop called me. I'm the first person in your list of favorites. See? - Right there. - [Lucy] Yeah. And after you ran out of your fitting-- [Anna] That's why you have your dress. That makes sense. When are we supposed to get married? New Year's Eve. Why would I run out of my fitting? I don't know, but maybe I could show you some pictures to help spark your memory. See, here... we are. That was our first... Guys... I'm sorry. I should get back to work. It was really nice to meet you both. Take care. Zach, wait. Thank you for everything. Yeah. Of course. - Take care. - Bye. Bye. Are you hungry? I could go grab your something. Your favorite sushi place is just down that way. Actually, I think Lucy probably just needs a good night's sleep. I'm happy to stay with her tonight. Yes. Sleep sounds great. But thank you. And I'll see you... - Tomorrow night? It's the Annual Foundation Christmas Party. Okay, yes. The Christmas party. I don't want to put too much pressure on you, but Alex Miles, our potential financier, is going to be there, and you really wanted to meet him, but if it's too much, I can totally handle it. - Oh, no, no, no, no, it sounds important, and I should be there, so. Um... I will see you tomorrow night, Brad Martin. Just Brad is good. Of course. Sorry. Have a good night. - Oh... - Thank you. Are you okay? I don't know. I just wish that I could remember something. Anything. I know just the thing to jog your memory. Okay. I present... the closet of Lucy. This is my closet? Isn't it amazing? So I dress like this every day? - Of course. You are a strong, powerful woman. That's why we're best friends. We haven't exchanged friendship bracelets or anything, but I know everything about you. Oh, good. Like what? Like you are adamant that we get all our steps in at the office. Mm-hmm... - You love hot chocolate, but you sneeze when you have dairy. I do. Did I ever mention what happened between Zach and I? - You mentioned you had an ex named Zach, but I had no idea you two were engaged. Hey, how about you get into some PJs, and then you can ask me all the questions. - Okay. - Okay. [♪♪♪] [Zach] You want a soda or something? - No, but what I want to know is what happened yesterday. Nothing. I just drove her home. That's it? Did you figure out why she had a wedding dress? She's got a fiancé. Okay, wait. The ex-love of your life walks in here, thinking that she's supposed to marry you... and you just drive her to her fiancé. It's no big deal? She's got a slight case of retrograde amnesia. Retrograde or not... Don't you think this means something? What means something? Mom, Lucy Lovett was in here! [Mom] Lucy was here? - Why? - To marry Zach! Okay, all right. Okay, calm down. We don't know that for sure. Okay, she hit her head, she lost her memory, and she was confused. And now she's gone. I have customers, okay? [Mom] Lucy lost her memory? Is she okay? Well, she still likes Zach, so who knows. [♪♪♪] [Lucy] The Foundation looks amazing. Right? So you remember what we prepped? Yeah, I think so. Good. Wait, who are they again? Seamus from I.T. and his wife, Becca. Hamish... it's so good to see you. How was that? Great, besides the little fact that his name is Seamus. Why did I decide to hide this from my staff? I mean, I should just tell people I have no idea who they are. You're doing great. You know what, maybe you should have some pie. That'll fix everything. This is store-bought. Why didn't I just bake it? You bake pie? Yeah, especially at Christmas. I mean, it's tradition. We have a whole Silent Night Pie Auction and everything. Are you sure? Because the Lucy I know barely knows her way around the kitchen. There's Brad with Alex Miles. Okay, here I go... Hi. Lucy Lovett, this is-- Alex Miles. Pleasure to meet you. - It's great to finally meet you. Brad was just telling me what a force you are at the Foundation. Oh, Brad's just being kind. And Lucy is just being modest. In the two years that she has been here, she has single-handedly curated some of the most successful American artists and brought in over a million in donations. [Alex] Impressive. We have a busy few weeks coming up ahead of us. Our wedding is on New Year's Eve. And we'll be announcing the donor to fund the new wing. Alex, we were hoping that person might be you. Well, it's an optimistic timeline, but I'm not opposed to it. Let's meet after Christmas to discuss. Great. [Brad, on phone] Why do you need to go back? Why can't you just see Dr. Evans here? Well, I'm hoping going to Bedford Harbor will help fill some gaps in my memory. I could come with you? Oh... No, that's... I appreciate it, but, really, I'm-- I'm fine. Well, call me if you need anything, okay? Okay, I will. Thanks, Brad. Bye. Okay, this would look amazing on-- What's wrong? I don't know. I just... I told Brad that I was fine, but... I don't know if I'm fine. I barely remember anything... and I have no idea how Zach's going to react to me just showing up again, and I honestly don't even know what I'm expecting. To get answers. You know what... I'm coming with you. No, honestly, I'm-- Fine? Please, just let me be there for you. Really? Thank you. We're going to Bedford Harbor! Yeah. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Anna] This town looks like a Christmas postcard. [Lucy] I know. Before we go in, last chance. Are you sure you want to do this? I still can't remember what happened between Zach and I, or why we broke up. I mean, there's a huge hole in the past two years of my life. How am I supposed to marry Brad, or even start to move on, when... my heart's still trapped in the past? Okay. Just checking. [Zach] I told you, I can't, okay? Come on, you'll be my favorite brother. I'm your only brother. Smells good, guys. You know, I have an I.O.U. from the fifth grade that I never cashed in. I told you, I fed your goldfish. Come on, we need you. Mom and I will set up the Harbor Skate. All you have to do is pick up the lights for the Tree Lighting Ceremony. I can't, okay? I have to close. I thought you got someone to cover your shift. I can cover for you. Oh! Ask and you shall receive. Sarah, I can't-- I can't let you do that. The Christmas Festival wouldn't be the same without the tree lighting? [Lucy] She's right. It wouldn't. Lucy... You're back? Yeah, I thought coming back to Bedford might help me fill in some memory gaps. Can you talk? Well, we were just actually heading out to the rink to set up... Oh, okay. Yeah, um... Why don't you join us there later? [Anna] That sounds fun! - Yeah. I'm Beau Callahan by the way. I'm Zach's younger, handsomer brother. [laughs] He's also the comedian. Anna Hepburn. No relation to the movie star. Could've fooled me. Okay, so... we'll see you at the skate? - Yeah, great. - It starts at 7:00! Okay. - Bye. - See ya. - [Lucy] Bye. - Bye. [Lucy] Here we are. [Anna] I love your Aunt Audrey's cottage. It is exactly how I remembered it. You have an amazing housekeeper. That painting is beautiful. [Lucy] Aunt Audrey painted that. - Wow. - Yeah. She used to come up here just to paint. She said it inspired her. Her love for art is the whole reason she started the Foundation. So your room is around the corner, down the hall. [♪♪♪] What is this? Fleece. The greatest winter invention ever. I know what it is, I've just never seen you wear it. Oh, my gosh. This is my favorite sweater. Clearly, because it looks like it's been worn a thousand times. What else do you have in here? Oh, wow... [♪♪♪] What are those? Um... Zach and I made these ornaments together. He knew that my parents had passed away, and after his dad passed, we just kind of started making our own Christmas traditions, you know? The Festival was a really big part of it, and it just became our favorite time of the year. That's why we decided to get married on Christmas. Were you going to get married in fleece? You joke, but it keeps you warm, okay? You're going to want that on the rink tonight. I'm good, thank you. Okay, suit yourself. Ready to go? Yeah. Let's go skating. [♪♪♪] [Anna] How am I already frozen? [Lucy] I told you it gets cold. Maybe I should take a quick peek at that booth for some gloves. Okay, I'll meet you at the rink. I'm going to take a quick look around. Okay. [Zach] All right, sounds good. I'll be there in the morning to open. Okay. Bye. Hey... Hey. Are those lights for the tree? Yeah, I forgot how many we needed. I thought I was the one with the memory problems. I can't believe how much that tree has grown. It's amazing, huh? I was a kid when we planted that. You know, I noticed that there's no tree in the Roadhouse yet. I'm sure Beau's giving you a hard time about that. I've just been busy. You know that's no excuse for someone who loves Christmas. I haven't really been into as much since-- Hey! Lucy! - Welcome back! - Trudy... - Hi, Mom. - It's so good to see you. - You came just in time. I hope you're staying for the week? I think so, yeah. I wouldn't want to miss out on all my favorite Christmas traditions. So how's the Arts Education Program going? Oh! Well, we haven't been able to run it since you left. What? Well, no one quite had your passion for it. You left, and we made due. I'm sorry, I had no idea. [Beau] Hey! You two coming or what? Well, I still got to put these lights up, so. - Oh, we can-- We can do that after. You two go have fun. [Zach] All right, Mom. You ready to hit the ice? I know how much you love skating. - I don't know how Dr. Albright would feel about it, but... I'll just take it easy. Yeah. It's good to see you, Lucy. - You too, Trudy. Thanks, Mom. - You're going to take it easy? - [Lucy laughs] - [Lucy] I'm going to try. - [Zach] Okay. [♪♪♪] All right, Callahan. Let's go. Looks like I still know how to beat you, Callahan. Looks like I still know how to let you win, Lovett. Hey... Trudy said something about me leaving that I don't remember... She made it sound like my leaving was the problem. Like I just left everyone to pick up the pieces. It's not a big deal. No, it is. Zach, I never meant to hurt you. I know that. [Anna] Okay, I got it. You're doing great. Is this really your first time on skates? Yes! Hey, guys. You never told me you loved skating! It's kind of what you do in Bedford Harbor. We used to have to drag her off the ice every Festival. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken, you were right there with her. This is true. You failed to mention that part. - [Beau] Right? - Yes. There you are. - Hi. - Morgan... I went by the Roadhouse and Sarah said you were here. Imagine my surprise. Yeah, Sarah said she'd close for me so I could help Beau set up. [Morgan] Oh, good. Lucy Lovett... Morgan LeBlanc. Hi. It's good to see you! Hi! You didn't mention that Lucy was back. - Oh, I'm just in town for a couple of days. Lucy-- She lives in Portland now. Oh! Oh, right. Yeah! I remember. Our family owns a vineyard out there. [Anna] Your family owns... LeBlanc Vineyards? Yes. Oh, Anna Hepburn, Lucy's best friend. Hi. Nice to meet you. Sorry. - So, you two are dating? [Morgan] Yes, we are. Yeah. That's really great. [Anna] You know, I just remembered, you have a conference call later on tonight. - I do? - [Anna] Yes! Lucy runs the Lovett Art Foundation, and you know how it is. Powerful executives, it never ends. Lucy, good for you. [Lucy] Thank you. Okay, I guess I should get that conference call. It's good to see you. You too. Bye, guys. Do I really have a conference call? [Anna] No, but did you want to be the awkward third wheel with Zach and Morgan LeBlanc? No, definitely not. I just can't believe he's dating Ms. Bedford Harbor. Lucky for you, you are engaged to a very handsome, successful CFO. Right, I am. Brad. [♪♪♪] Okay, on a scale of one to 10, how awkward was last night? Because I would give it... a 20. Why? Lucy's engaged to Brad. Lucy doesn't even remember Brad, but she clearly remembers Morgan. Yeah, I guess I could have mentioned something about that. Yeah, it might not have been a bad idea. Yeah. So does she remember much about the break-up? Not much. Have you tried to talk about it? I just-- I haven't had the chance. You should bring it up. She's going to remember eventually. It's better if it comes from you. Look, I know what's going to happen once she gets her memory back. She's going to go back to Portland and her fiancé. I'm not going to get ahead of myself. I just don't understand how we could be so close to marriage, and then I'm in Portland... engaged to someone else, living a life that I don't recognize. You chose to leave, right? - I think so. It was my job to take over my Aunt's Foundation. Just... last night was so fun. Well, most of it was fun. I was skating with Zach like old times-- And it just feels like home here. Have you ever considered that maybe your memory blocks, they aren't physical? They could be psychological? What do you mean? Meaning that our memories, they are selective, because there are things we just don't want to remember. Our minds are trying to protect us. Maybe there's a reason who you're not remembering your new life. So you think I'm blocking it on purpose? Subconsciously, you could be. Because something bad happened? No. Not necessarily bad. I just... I feel like it's all my fault. Did someone say that to you? No, but I can tell. - Then you can't be sure. Lucy, it does no good for you to be so hard on yourself. Could you try being gentler on yourself instead? Okay, now let's start with the things that make you feel happy. Something familiar. Something that might lead you to a memory. [♪♪♪] Wow. It's like Christmas exploded in here. What are you doing? Dr. Albright told me to do things that remind me of happier times. Christmas makes me happy. Then how come you don't look happy? I usually do this with Zach. And now he's dating Morgan. Yeah. I don't know, I'm just... I'm confused, you know, and I want answers, but I don't want to come in between anyone and I don't want to be disrespectful. Than maybe you just need to tell Zach that. I'm sure he understands. Yeah, I don't know. What else did the doctor say? Just that I should do things that feel familiar, try and jog my memory. Then I'd say hanging out with Zach is doctor's orders. You know, you didn't have to come with me. You could have just let me borrow your truck. And let you drive? Hey, I'm a very cautious driver. Except for that time that you backed into my mailbox. What? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It's all right, though. Sarah's trying to get me out of the restaurant as much as possible. I don't know if I should be taking it personally. She seems nice. I'm really happy that everything's going so well for you. You know, I know it was difficult after your dad. My dad was such a natural at running the place. It hasn't been without hard work, but the Roadhouse has really become the local hangout. Well, I'm glad I could steal you away... help you remember Christmas. I thought that was my job-- To help you remember? How's that working out? It's okay. Some things seem so familiar, and other things completely foreign, like I don't even recognize my life in Portland, and I have no idea how I even got here. I drove you. You know what I mean. I just... I don't even recognize this Lucy. Honestly, I couldn't imagine having holes in your memory. Yeah, well, it's not easy. I keep questioning myself. I'm trying to fill in the gaps, but I just keep thinking about our breakup. I keep wondering why I would ever leave you. - Lucy... It was two years ago. It's okay. We've moved on. You're running the Foundation now, and the restaurant couldn't be busier. And you're dating Ms. Bedford Harbor. I'm sorry. I... I should have mentioned Morgan sooner. It's just... it's still new, and... You were still getting your memory back. You don't need to apologize. It's okay. You sure you don't want a Christmas tree? Let's just focus on yours. Zach... whatever happened between us... don't take it out on Christmas. Ms. Lucy! - Katie! - Hi, Katie. Hi! Wow, your Grandma was not kidding. You're so grown-up. Are you back in town now? Just for Christmas. Oh... Okay. Are you still painting? A little, but I really miss your class. I know. I'm sorry. But I hope I'm still going to see you at the Festival? - Yes! - Okay, great. - It's so good to see you. - You too. - Bye, Ms. Lucy! - Bye. - Bye. Katie. - Bye. Hey, guys, wait up! I feel bad. It seems like she's really disappointed about the Art Program. Why don't you just invite her up to your program in Portland? I actually don't know if I set that up. Are you sure? I heard you practice your pitch to your Aunt Audrey, like, a thousand times. That sounds vaguely familiar. I'm sure you worked it out. That's it! What's it? The perfect tree. Are you sure? Yeah. There's a lot of factors to consider when picking a tree. You don't want to rush into it. I should know. I grew up on a tree farm. Nope, that's the one. Sometimes, you just know when you find it. Back a little more. Just a little more. Okay, stop, stop. Thank you for helping me. It was fun, right? Even though you have lost most of your Christmas spirit. I'm not a total scrooge. Maybe just a little? [car approaching] Who's that? [Lucy] I don't know. Brad? Surprise! - Hi. - Good timing. - Oh, you-- - Yeah, please. That would be great. - Hi. - Hi. What are you... It seemed like you were sticking around for a bit... so I called the office and I got the address. I booked myself a great B&B in town, and, well, I just thought I'd surprise you. That's--that's really sweet. Lucy, I get it. You don't remember us... or me. It must be really confusing for you. So I thought I'd show up here, and, well, you know, help you remember. Do you need some help with that? No, I'm good. It's just-- It's a little sappy. I can give you a hand over there. Oh, hey, I got it. On second thought, maybe you should carry it. Yeah. This week is the Bedford Christmas Festival. Basically, every night, we celebrate a different tradition. You could join Anna and me? - I'd love to. - Okay. What sort of traditions? [Zach] Oh, we have the snowman-making competition, the pie auction, tree-lighting ceremony. Yeah, well, years ago, Zach planted a tree in the harbor with his dad, and, over the years, it just kind of became the community tree. People bring ornaments they want to share. And make Christmas wishes. Anyway, it's really just an excuse for all of us to get together and celebrate Christmas all week long. That sounds amazing. [Lucy] Yeah. It really is. You know, I've never really heard you talk about Bedford Harbor before. Really? No, in fact, I didn't really know how important it was to you at all until... Well, I mean, you took a cab here... [Zach] Okay, all done. Oh, here, let me... Okay. - Great, just... - Just do it on three? Yeah. One, two, three. Okay. I should probably get the back. Hi. You found your tree! And friends! Fun! Come on in! - Right through there? - Right through there, yeah. Okay, just... right, there. Perfect, perfect. Yeah. Okay... You got all the old decorations up. Yeah. I wanted it to be really Christmassy. Well, it definitely is. It's very Christmas-cozy. Speaking of Christmas, did you know the Snowman Contest starts soon? Yes. We should get ready to go. Can I borrow a sweater? You want to borrow one of my sweaters? Help me pick it out. [Brad clears his throat] Gosh, I can't believe Brad's here. I had nothing to do with it, I swear. No, I think he just wants to know the reason why I like this town so much, Did you tell him his name is Zach? That is not the reason! - No, of course not. Definitely not. So is that your truck? It's nice. Thanks, yeah. I use it for deliveries, pick-ups, you know, for the restaurant, the tree farm. Cool. You work at a restaurant? Yeah. I own The Roadhouse in town. I inherited it from my dad. - Nice. I run a non-profit with Lucy. I'm sure she's already told you all about that, so. She has. Brad seems really nice, but what if I don't like him like that? You liked him enough to get engaged. Yeah, but I mean, that was the Lucy that wore suits and schmoozed. I don't even recognize that Lucy. What if that Lucy's not me? - I hear you, but, technically, you are still the same person. Just don't overthink it. Just be yourself-- Whoever that is-- And then see how you feel. You are literally the best. I know. I can't remember, is it deciduous or coniferous trees that don't lose their needles. [Zach] Coniferous. [Brad] Are you sure about that? I'm going to Google that one here. I'm pretty sure about that. You guys ready to go? - Yeah. - Yeah. So exactly how does the snowman contest work? Oh, it's really fun and easy. You'll just figure it out. [Beau] Hey, there you guys are. I'm looking for a partner for the Snowman Contest? I'd love to! Awesome. See you later. Okay, I guess we'd better pick teams, then. Well, you two should partner up. Oh, no. You can join us... right, Brad? I mean, it's only fair. Do they allow teams of three? That actually seems unfair. Hey, sorry I'm late. [Zach] Morgan! You're here. - Yeah, for the Snowman Contest. That's great. Remember we talked about this? Of course he remembers. Yeah. - I'm sorry. You must be... Lucy's fiancé. Brad Martin. - Oh, fiancé? That's great! Yeah. Brad surprised me and came in from Portland. Oh, that is so sweet. - [cell phone rings] - Yeah, it's really sweet. Oh, excuse me. I should... I should probably get this. Sorry. Hey, yeah... So you'll never guess what happened at work. My Dad wants me to go to Napa for the wine show this week. There's a wine show at Christmas? - Isn't that great? - Yeah... When are you supposed to leave? - In two days... But, actually, I was thinking maybe you could come. Well, it's... it's Christmas. I know, but we've talked about going away for Christmas before, and this way, we could have it in the sunshine. I have The Roadhouse, and my mom needs me here for the Christmas Festival. - I know-- - It's just-- Just think about it, okay? Okay, I'm going to go find Brad! Okay. Okay, Jerry. Yeah, thanks. Bye. [Lucy] Hi. [Brad] Hey, I was just-- I was just coming to find you. Oh, good. The competition is about to start, and we are going to win. Okay. Lead the way. Is everything okay at the Foundation? Yeah... it's just a little stressful trying to figure out the logistics of putting in a new wing. I know we've probably already discussed this, but... what will the new wing offer us? More space for galas and for fundraisers. Did we ever talk about my Art Education Program? We did, but Audrey's concern was who would manage it? And I agreed with her. It wasn't the right time. I mean, I would. I could. Yeah, but your workload is already pretty heavy procuring new donors, and we have to focus all of our time and energy on that. What good is an Art Foundation if it's not about art? [Trudy] All right, five-minute warning until we begin the Snowman Contest! Should we go win this thing? Yeah. It is time for the Bedford Snowman Contest. What a great turnout! [cheering] So the snowmen are built, but they are freezing, so the rule is have a good time, and the fastest, fully-dressed, and most creative snowman wins, okay? On your mark, get set, snow! Where are the arms? [Lucy] It's faster if you do the arms last. Wait, why don't we have any arms? Oh, wait, there are no arms. Callahan. [Zach] Lovett. Ladies first. Thank you. - [Morgan] Did you get them? - [Zach] Yeah. Well, carrots. Okay, okay. Okay. [♪♪♪] No, no, no. They're not going to fit. What else does Santa have? [bell ringing] Time's up. [applause and cheering] [Trudy] I can't believe it, but the winner this year of the Snowman Contest is none other than... Beau Callahan! [cheering] And... Anna Hepburn. Like the movie star. [cheering] Great teamwork, you two! - Good stuff. - Great job. [Trudy] Anyone one want more marshmallows? Oh, thank you for getting more sticks. Of course. Trudy, the Festival looks great. You have really outdone yourself. Oh, thank you. I wish I could do more. I know what you mean. I just found out that my Art Education Program in Portland never even happened. I'm really sorry to hear that. [Lucy] That's the whole reason that I went to Portland. I can't believe that we would choose business over art and children's education. Well, there's only so much one person can do. I'm sure there was a reason. I saw Katie earlier today and she seemed really disappointed. Just... I feel like I've let a lot of people down, and I can't remember why. I know it's not the same, but if you want to create an art booth in the barn this week, you're welcome to. Really? I know the kids would love it. Oh, my gosh, that would be so great. Good. Thank you. I can't believe Christmas is four days away... It's just moving so fast. Yeah. Are you hungry? I'm okay. You know there's a sushi restaurant in Portland that we ate at so much, they called us Mr. and Mrs. Brad. - Really? - Yeah. Do we have our own table? We did take-out mostly. It's just, it's really close to the office, so it's convenient, and they're probably one of the only good spots open late. We work late a lot? Yeah, basically, every night, but I think it was those long work hours that bonded us, you know? Brad... I know we're supposed to get married soon, and I appreciate that this isn't easy for you-- - Lucy-- I don't want to put any pressure on you, okay? So I've put the whole day on hold. I mean, we have our entire lives to be married to each other, so let's just focus on you getting back your memory and remembering how much you loved our life in Portland. Thank you. That is so nice of you. I'm a nice guy. - The pie auction is tonight. Are you sure you don't want to bake with me today? I mean, you get to taste test. I wish I could, but I will be there this afternoon to bid on your pie. Oh, if you can guess which one's mine. Oh, I got this. [Lucy laughs] Really? Confident. [♪♪♪] Lovett. Callahan. Fancy meeting you here. Yeah, the restaurant ran out of nutmeg. Apparently, it's popular over Christmas. Oh, who knew? I'm just getting the pie essentials, which I will not name because it's a surprise. You're-- You're entering the contest? - Of course. I mean, it's tradition, right? You remember that year that you ate the entire pie before we even got there? To be fair, I was taste-testing that year, and it was butter pecan... Always was a sucker for the pecan. Still am. Morgan said that she was... she was baking something very special, so... Don't ruin your appetite. Yeah. See you out there. [♪♪♪] [Anna] You know there are still a few decorations left in here to put up. [Lucy] You know, that's okay. I'm going to save those. Okay. Sure. Why are we wearing these again? Because it's Christmas tradition. And you know what, you better just go with it, because it is proven to be good luck. [Anna] I'm glad they're good for something because it's not fashion. Is this a men's sweater? It was Zach's. He was my old assistant pastry chef, so. [Anna] Look, I know I've got a big sweater to fill, but I will not let you down. Well, thank you, but I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me. You think Zach's going to be there? I know Zach's going to be there. I ran into him at the grocery store. Oh, really? Yes, but... I've decided that I'm not going to push him for any more details on why we broke up. It's clear that I hurt him, and he doesn't want to talk about it, so I'm not going to make him go there, you know? I'll just move forward. Good for you. I enjoy spending time with him, and if it helps me bring my memory back, then that's all I can ask for. Exactly. So, what are we making? Something delicious and something that's a surprise. The secret is all in the crust. I kind of like this Lucy. Wait until you taste my pie. All right, last chance to place your bids. Remember to place your bid in the box in front of each pie. The highest bidder per pie gets a photo with the baker, and a sure-to-be-decadent dessert. All donations go to the Kids' Community Center. "The Strawberry Claus." That's got to be you, right? Lucy, I'm sop glad you entered. Your pies are legendary around these parts. Oh, thank you so much, Norah. I just hope I remember how to bake. You're not going to give me a hint? No way. You have to guess just like everybody else. Do you have any intel at all? Anything? Nope. But I can guarantee you it's a 20 out of 10. Oh. Okay. Okay. [Trudy] The results are in. It's time to announce the winners. For the Strawberry Claus, the highest bidder is Beau Callahan. And the baker, Norah Elliot. Hey. For the next pie, O Holy Pecan, the highest bidder is Brad Martin. And the baker? Morgan LeBlanc. And for the next pie, Cranberry Christmas Strudel, the highest bidder is... Zach Callahan. And the baker... Lucy Lovett. Moving on to the next pie, Santa's Secret Spice, the highest bidder... Clara Nelson. - Strawberry Claus. - [camera shutter clicks] Thank you. So do you bake often? Not really. I just entered for Zach. [Trudy] All right, take a bite. I didn't mean to bid on you. We talked about the pecan, so... [Lucy] You wanted to avoid it. I totally get it. I was trying to do the same thing. [Trudy] Great. Thank you. Next. Take a bite. Smile. - How is it? - It's perfect. [camera beeping] Oh... I just-- I need a new memory card. Be right back. How did you come up with it? Um, I just wanted to make something Christmassy and comforting. It reminds me of something my mom used to bake when I was younger. It just felt like love. Well, I'm happy you're baking again. What do you mean again? Well, you didn't bake for, like, the last three months of our relationship. Why did I stop? I guess you didn't think it was a priority anymore. Oh... I had no idea. I'm sorry. [Trudy] All right, I've got it. One last one. Smile. Great! Love it. Thank you. Thanks, Mom. - Hey. - Hi. Lucy, do you have a minute? Yeah, of course. Excuse me. Zach... of course mine was the pecan. I know. I just... You said you were going to bake something very special. Yeah, special as in your favorite. I thought you loved pecan. I do. I'm sorry. I messed up. Do you still have feelings for her? What? No. We broke up two years ago. Yeah, that-- That doesn't really answer my question. Hey. Let's go outside by the fire pit, okay? You know what, Zach, I... I'm tired. I'm going to go. Raincheck. Good night. [Lucy] What's up? [Brad] There's just a lot I'm dealing with remotely and it would be easier to deal with at the office. I could drive us? Now? I was going to set up the children's art booth tomorrow. An art booth... Why? There's still a lot I'm trying to figure out and remember. I'm just not ready to go yet. I need more time. Lucy, I know you're confused, and you're going through this whole identity crisis, but this... this isn't working. - I know. I can't remember our time together... but... I can tell that you're a really good man. You deserve better than this. You know, I should have known when you didn't put your ring back on. I tried to get there, but... I don't think I can. - When we first met... it was like instant friendship. We spent so much time at the office together, it was only natural that we started dating. But... I always knew there was a piece of you that wasn't really there. I'm really sorry, Brad. That's okay, Lucy. I still care about you, even if we aren't meant to be together. Will you still stay on as CFO? I really don't want things to change. Of course... we're partners. I should... I should go. Brad, just one more thing. Why didn't we move forward on the Arts Education Program? Please just tell me. We're a non-profit, Lucy. We went through some hard times, and we just decided it was the best route. We decided... or you did? - Lucy... it wasn't me. It was you. I should go. [Lucy] What if I made a mistake? [Dr. Albright] About what, dear? Brad. Why would I break off our engagement just because I can't remember who he is right now? What if I get my memory back, and... I regret it. Well, you'll just have to trust your heart, Lucy. Chances are that if you don't feel that way now, that's not going to change. I'm having trouble trusting my heart about anything right now. I don't think it's working right. I can assure you there is nothing wrong with your heart... medically. Then why would I break up with Zach? As far back as I can remember, I've loved him. I think that something happened that's made you afraid to see the truth. The psychological block? Mm-hmm. Have you talked to Zach about what happened to you two? Well, he's hurt... and... he's with Morgan. If he wasn't with Morgan, would you want to get back together? Even if I did, I mean, I can't promise him that I won't hurt him again. I don't even know why I broke up with him in the first place. You'll just have to trust that when the time comes, the answers will come when you need them. In the meantime, just-- just keep doing what you love. Keep doing the things you love, okay? I'm so happy you're my doctor. I'm so happy you're my friend. You guys! I'm so excited to see you. I missed you guys! Are we ready to paint? [children] Yeah! Yeah! All right. Who here remembers learning about the Impressionist Period? Okay. So, you're going to pick a portrait or your favorite painting from the Impressionist Period, and then... over the next couple of days, you're going to put your own Christmas twist on it. Like how would Rodin interpret Christmas? I think Santa as "The Thinker" is wondering, "Who here is on the nice list?" Yeah? Okay, so, take a look. Here you go. And think about what you might want to paint. And then I'll be right here if you guys have any questions, okay? Yes? Miss Lucy, can we paint anyone we want? Yes. You can paint anyone you want. [boy] Cool. This is so awesome. Lucy, this is really great. Thank you for trusting in me. I just want you to know that the Arts Program is always my number one priority. Oh, I know it was. Aunt Audrey was always so focused on work. I'm just worried that that might have happened to me, too. Well, it happens to the best of us. It is so good to have you back. Thank you. Well, if it isn't the pie bandit. Hey. I didn't think that you and Brad were coming back last night. Brad went to Portland. Things are really busy at the Foundation, and... we decided that it's best if we just keep things professional between us. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Just mostly coming to terms with the fact that I'm the type of person to break off two engagements. Morgan. Hi. Hi. I was just hoping we could talk. Of course. Yeah. You know, I have-- I have-- I just remembered I have a thing to do. Okay. What's up? I'm leaving tonight. That's right. You're going to California. I was-- I was hoping that we were both going. - I know. I... I just... I have the restaurant, and my mom-- She needs me for the Festival. It's just, it's just-- It's just bad timing. And Lucy. Look, it's okay, Zach. You know, I thought this place was taking up all your time and attention, but I realize now that you weren't really ready to let anyone in because you weren't over Lucy. - I'm sorry. - I know. I want you to be happy. But you have to sort out your feelings for Lucy. And I need to find the person who's right for me. Merry Christmas, Zach. Merry Christmas. Bye. I think that this is the most beautiful the tree has ever been. I wanted to make it extra special. [Dr. Albright] Good to have her back. [Trudy] It really is. [Zach] Hey. What were you doing out there? Just... taking in the view. So you made it. Yeah. I wouldn't miss the tree-lighting ceremony. Says the guy with no tree. So where's Morgan? She went to California. We broke up. I'm sorry, Zach. No. It's for the best. [bell ringing] Good evening! It is so good to see so many familiar faces for the Annual Tree Lighting. My late husband, Jack, planted this tree nearly 30 years ago with our sons, Beau and Zach, using a seedling from the Callahan Tree Farm. I know if he was here with us today, he'd be so proud to see what's become of our community tree. Once it's all lit up, you can take a special ornament, put it on the tree, and make a Christmas Wish. So without further ado... Beau and Zach, will you please do the honors? Merry Christmas, everyone! May all your wishes come true! [♪♪♪] There he is! Hi! Our Mistletoe Dove. Yeah. It represents a special time, full of happy memories, so I thought it might give my wish good luck. What did you wish for? I can't remember. [Dr. Albright] Now, that warms my heart. I'm so happy to see you two taking another shot. You two--you were always so good together. [together] Oh, we're not-- We're not together. Oh, I made a mistake. Well, what do I know? I'm only the doctor. You two, you enjoy the rest of your evening. - Thanks. - Thank you, Dr. Albright. "Executive Lovett has been encouraging her team to open a new wing at the gallery." "People don't like to talk about it, but art is a business like any other." It was all me... [phone rings] Brad, hi. Oh, hey, Lucy. How are you doing? I'm okay. I... was actually just going through some Foundation files. Oh, okay, great. Yeah, because Alex Miles wants to move the meeting up to tomorrow. That's Christmas Eve. Yeah, I know, but Alex has to fly back to China on Christmas Day and he won't be back until after the New Year. That's really sudden. Yeah. Listen, Lucy, I know you're still trying to figure things out, but... it would mean a lot to have you there. I mean, that pitch that you created-- It will really sell him. Okay, yeah. Can I let you know? Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Brad. Bye. [Lucy] Good job working together. That looks great, guys. That looks awesome. I love your colors. Good job. Hey, guys. Wow, Ryan, this is really impressive. Katie helped. It looks great. I'm going to add some glitter to the stars to make them sparkly! I think that is a great idea. Good job! [Zach] Well, what an impressive group of little artists you've curated here. We're putting up a mini gallery with their favorite Impressionist paintings adapted for Christmas. Did you come up with this idea? Maybe. It's very clever. Well, I was planning to use it in Portland for my Art Program. Are you here to see your mom? Actually, I'm here to see you. That sounds serious. It definitely is. The Roadhouse is sponsoring the Sleigh Rides tonight, and I'm meant to supply the Christmas snacks. I was hoping maybe you could help me come up with something a little bit more... Christmassy? Exactly. Mm-hmm. Well... if we're going to take Christmas seriously, there's something we have to do first... I hope it doesn't involve our Christmas sweaters, 'cause I can't find mine anywhere. Actually, no. Okay, good. Okay. All right. What do you think? [exhales] It's perfect. Are you sure? I mean, I'm no tree expert, but a friend once told me that finding the perfect tree is something that you don't rush. You've got to be sure. He sounds like a wise man. Yeah, he's all right for a guy who steals Christmas trees. Wait. I got the family discount. I feel like you and Beau have this skewed idea of what discount means. - Agree to disagree. - Okay. Good. Mm-hmm. Let's get the decorations. [Lucy] Okay. [Zach] Are you sure? [Lucy] I know how to decorate a Christmas tree. [Zach] This is the third time you're trying to do that thing. Where do you think-- Where do you think this should go? Boop. That's what I was thinking. Okay, now it's perfect. Nope, not yet. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Come on, just-- All right, all right, all right. My eyes are closed. [Lucy] Keep them closed. Okay. [Zach] Our old ornaments? Where did you get these? They were at the cottage. I figured we made them together, so it's only fair that I share them. I've missed this. Yeah, me too. I just... I don't understand how I could leave all this behind. [Zach] You know, Lucy, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Hey, did you pay for that tree? [Zach] The family discount. Kitchen's closed, buddy. Yeah, I know. I forgot my jacket here last night. Got it! Am I going to see you two later on? - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. Don't forget to bring the snacks. On it! [Lucy] All right, Assistant Pastry Chef, get prepping. How did we... [Zach] I can't believe we forgot this. I know. [Zach] I think we made enough for the entire Eastern Seaboard. [Lucy] That's if you don't taste-test everything. [Zach] So why did you want to come down here? [Lucy] Well, why not? It's one of my favorite places. And you know, you've got to do something while the cookies are cooling. You know, I haven't wanted to do this for a really long time. But now all I want to be is right here. Yeah. Brad called me... Oh, yeah? I thought you guys broke up? We did. But the meeting with the potential investor Alex Miles moved up. So Brad wants me back in Portland tomorrow. Christmas Eve? - I know. Are you going to go? It's about the future of the Foundation. I should be there. I'm the one who wrote the pitch on the new wing. Then you should probably go, right? - Yeah, but-- The more I learn about my role, it was all bureaucracy. I wasn't doing anything to make a difference in people's lives-- At least not in a meaningful way. Why don't you just push the meeting back? - It's not that easy. The Foundation needs funders to stay afloat. This is my Aunt Audrey's vision, you know? It's my job. I just can't let her down. So you're going to let yourself down instead? What is that supposed to mean? It's just... before you left, you were so set on what you wanted-- On what you wanted to create-- But you were also very concerned about what your Aunt Audrey would think. - She was pretty specific on what she wanted for the Foundation. - I'm sure she wanted what was best for you, too. She loved you. Yeah, well... She wasn't really the type of person to share her feelings like that, or at least not that I can remember. You still can't remember? Mm-mm. Dr. Albright said maybe it's something I don't want to remember. That my memory block isn't physical, it's psychological. Zach, what aren't you telling me? You wanted to say something earlier, and you didn't. - It's nothing. Those cookies have cooled off, I'm sure. Okay, let's go ice them. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Zach, stop! That is the last gingerbread man. If I eat them all, then no one will even know they existed. Come on. [♪♪♪] [Zach] What's up? Um... I just had a flash of something. Something to do with the horse-drawn carriage. [Zach] What was it? I don't know. [phone ringing] [Zach] Do you need to get that? Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. No worries. [Lucy] Hey, Brad... What's, um... what's going on? Just checking in. I was just wondering if you'd given any more thought about the meeting. It's tomorrow morning. Okay, you don't look nearly as happy as you should. What's up? Lucy's starting to remember. I take it you haven't talked about the break-up yet. Come on, Zach, I thought we talked about this. I know, man, it's just... things are starting to go really well with us, and if I tell her, then she might leave again. I don't want to ruin it. You will ruin it if you don't tell her. Lucy deserves to know the truth. Look, I'm going to go feed the horses quickly. Do it now-- Before you regret it. Okay, sorry. - Hey, no problem. Do you want to take a quick walk? I don't think we really have time. It's almost our turn. Beau said that he's going to feed the horses, so we have a minute. Yeah, sure. - Okay. Do you remember when we first came here? When you asked me to be your girlfriend? No, before that. I had first started working at the restaurant. My dad and I got into this huge argument about something that doesn't even matter anymore... And I asked you to go for a walk... and you told me, "Locals don't walk in the snow... they snowshoe." And you believed me... And you went out and you rented these extra-large snowshoes. It was the only size they had, and I looked ridiculous, thank you. You looked adorable. You know, it was on that walk that... you told me to talk to my dad, and that, no matter what I had to say to him, he'd understand, and that he would love me just the same. Lucy... I haven't always been a great communicator, but I want to be... and I know that I haven't talked to you about what happened when we broke up-- Don't worry about that, Zach. Like you said before, it's been a long time, and we both moved on, and we're good. Hey, you two. It's your turn. Let's go. [Lucy] Come on. [Zach] How is it our turn already? [Beau] You guys deserve a break. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. All right. - Thank you. - No problem. - Just like old times. - Mm-hmm. [Lucy sneezes] Dairy still has that same effect on you. It does. [♪♪♪] What's wrong? Zach... is this where we broke up? That's what I've been trying to tell you. It was after the sleigh ride. I remember the horses, and the hot chocolate, and we were singing, but you weren't happy... Why? You had these big dreams about the Foundation. But you were always worried about what Aunt Audrey wanted. I felt like you were chasing somebody else's dream, and... that you were pursuing a life that I didn't fit into anymore. I didn't break up with you... You broke up with me. It's complicated, okay? I can explain. You had so many opportunities to explain, and you didn't. Why? - Because... I didn't want you to leave. - So instead, you let me feel like I broke your heart? It's not like that. We were both hurting. It wasn't easy. I've been beating myself up this entire time... thinking that it was all my fault, but, really, it was you. You gave up on us. I didn't want to. I'm sorry. Yeah, I am sorry that I'm such an inconvenience in your life, but... I'll make it easy for you. I'm leaving, and this time, I'm not coming back. Lucy... Lucy! Oh... [Beau] I don't know. I think that-- [Anna] They should be. [Beau] I'm pretty sure because I'm a big fan. Are you? And I can see the resemblance. I promise. Can you hold this for a second? Yes. What happened? Brad needs me back at the Foundation tomorrow for a meeting with Alex Miles, so I'm going to go. But it's Christmas Eve tomorrow. We were just about to play a game of-- Zach was the one who broke up with me. I'm just so embarrassed. I'm really sorry, Anna, but I need to get out of here. I'll meet you at the car, okay? Okay. [Lucy] Thank you for driving. [Anna] No problem. I'm so sorry I took you away from Beau. It's okay. He hasn't seen the last of me. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, I'm just tired. [Anna] Get some rest. You have a big meeting tomorrow. You know, I remember everything now. When I got this place, it was already furnished. I was so heartbroken over Zach, that I just signed the lease. I didn't even care. - Well, at least, even in heartbreak, you have good taste, right? What if Zach's right? What if I did get wrapped up in all the things that just don't matter? You didn't do anything wrong, Lucy. I was the one who didn't push for the Arts Education Program. You were just doing your job. - What was I doing to help people? I mean, how was I changing lives? I feel like such a failure. I mean, what would Aunt Audrey think? - I think she would want you to follow your heart. [Trudy] That's a beautiful tree. It's Christmas Eve. Shouldn't you be at the Christmas Festival? I'm just taking a little break. You should do the same... I heard Lucy left. She did. Is she coming back? I don't think so. She... remembered how we broke up. Zach, you felt it was the right thing to do at the time. I think you were afraid to go. I wasn't-- I wasn't afraid to leave. I have duties here. Zach, you can't hide behind your responsibilities. None of this is more important than living your life, and putting your heart out there. Mom, she left. So, you're going to pretend she doesn't exist? I mean, Lucy might have forgotten who she is, but you haven't. I know how much you care about her. You need to be honest about how you feel, or you might miss your chance. Mom... I love you. I love you more. There you are. [Brad] Lucy, I'm so glad you made it. Of course. It is my family's Foundation and we're partners. You trust me, right? Yeah, of course. Okay. Just back me up in there. Okay. [Lucy] Alex. Hi. So good to see you again. You as well. Brad was just catching me up on things. Oh, great. I know is my original pitch, but I feel that this is no longer the right step. Why? Well, I've done some research on your fund, and... I feel we have a lot in common. How's that? You used to play piano, right? When I was young, yeah. Why did you quit? It didn't seem as important. It didn't seem practical. Do you miss it? I do, actually. So often, children give up on their artistic endeavors because of criticism, or because they think it's less important. But it isn't. I believe that children need to be encouraged to do art for art's sake. I'm listening. I propose we build the new wing... but for artists who need people to believe in them. I want that to be our focus. We can have an outreach program across the country, the first one being in Portland... and then Bedford Harbor... and so on. I like what I'm hearing, but I'll have to see what that means in terms of numbers. [Lucy] Oh, of course. Anything you need. Okay. Well... let me think it through, but my gut is telling me we'd make great partners on this. Thank you so much, Alex. Brad, do you mind going over the rest of the details with Alex? There's somewhere that I need to be. Of course, Lucy. Thank you. And thank you again. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! [♪♪♪] [Lucy] They finished them. [Beau] Hey, Lucy. Hey, Beau. Zach's not here. But... I think I know where he might be. Thank you, Beau. You're welcome. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] I remember why I ran out of that bridal shop. I was lying to myself about what I thought I wanted, and... I realized that when I was holding my wedding dress. Even though you broke up with me... I wasn't giving up... I was on my way back to you. Well, I guess that we're being guided back to each other... because I was coming to find you... but I wanted to make a wish first. Lucy... I didn't break up with you because I didn't want to be with you anymore. I felt like I was holding you back from what you really wanted. Zach, you are what I want. And I guess it took me forgetting who I was to remember who I am... Who I am is better with you. [♪♪♪] I'm not letting you go again. Good... because I'm moving back home. I think the financier is going to fund my Art Education Program. Congratulations, Lovett. I never had any doubt. I love you, Lucy. I have always loved you, Zach. So what did you wish for? I can't tell you. I can give you a hint. [♪♪♪]
