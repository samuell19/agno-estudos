Let's start with your blue eyeshadow on the lid. Be sure to tap off excess product before you apply. Start with the outer corner and blend inward.

You want to tell me what game you're playing? See this? That's my followers... And that video has 2,000 views. That's how many people just saw your clothes on my account. Which you're now returning, so how does that help me pay rent? Well, I tagged the store in my caption. So, you really shouldn't think of it as a few returned items. You should think of it as a few thousand potential customers. Well, you look good, I'll give you that. Once I hit 10,000 followers, I can get sponsored. And then what? And then... My life changes. Those just came in. Make sure the tag stays on. You stain it, you buy it. Okay! Okay, thank you... Thank you so much! Anything else I can do to help you change your life? Follow me! Hey, Seth. There's this big party tonight that I was... Stop calling me, Isla. We're over. You're just so... Fine. I have plenty of other guys I can go with. And take my photo off your social. Oh, I told you, that was just part of a video... Then take down the video. No! I will dox you, okay? And everybody will know your little psycho secret. I'm almost at 10,000 followers! Lose my number, Isla, or I will call the police... Again. Come on, Kiley, these baked goods aren't gonna pack themselves, seriously, you're addicted. It's a two-minute break. Would you two relax? Who's that? She lives here in town. If you like her videos, she shows up on your "for you" page. She has so many more followers than me. Grace, my dog has more followers than you. [Phone alert chimes] Who's PR? PR is Kiley's prince charming. Peter Ryan? Mm-hmm. From soccer? He wants me to go to the movies! I thought we were going to the movies. I don't think we can compete with PR's dimples. Please, guys? Go have your date with PR. I'll have a date with my stats homework. Isla, the last time you used my computer, you wiped out an excel document. My Internet was down. It just seems like that's the only time that I see you. No, dad. I also come for your gourmet cooking. Think you'd appreciate that I support myself. Most girls my age still get an allowance. Yeah... Well, most girls don't run off at 15 to get emancipated. Really? You wanna do that again? Mom left and you became like a prison guard. Because I had to make sure that you took care of your responsibilities. I have been responsible. I got my ged, didn't I? Yeah, you got your ged, but, really, it seems like you left to go party... And chase after boys. Don't lay that on me. I'm not the one who ran off. Hey, cami. Big party at Max's tonight. Wanna go? -Yeah. -Great. Ah, there you are! I thought you ran away from home because of your recent painful chess defeat. [Chuckles] A single checkmate does not a tournament make, dad. And I texted you back. "Brb"? OMG, dad. Join this century. [Chuckles] This is for my "simple seasonal savories" pin. Does everything have to rhyme? That's actually alliteration, dad. A cute title makes you stand out. A whole bunch of people saved my "pie in the sky" pin. I'm going to miss your cooking in college, mom. Oh... Our little bird is flying away. U of o, right? Wherever I get into that has the best program. I'm applying to UC Davis, too. And Cornell. Well, she is going to be valedictorian, after all. So we're moving to California or New York to keep an eye on her? I'm going to college! I don't need a babysitter! How are you so calm with our daughter living in another state? Because I know my daughter. She's only going to call home at least three times a day. Well... Let's pray! Thank you, lord, for this food and all your gifts. Amen. {mom and dad] Amen. [Music throbbing] [Isla] Hey! Max, can you take this video of us? -Of course. Yeah. -Okay, great. Great party, by the way. So good! [♪♪] Whoo! Isla! Isla! Isla! Isla! Isla! Whoo! Guys, follow me! Follow me! [Cheering] [♪♪] Okay, one more. So you used to live here? Until the third grade, yeah. My dad was in the military, so we moved around a lot. Mm. Army brat, huh? I think it's my turn to ask you a question. You hooked up with any of these guys? Not right now, no. [♪♪] [♪♪] [Grace] I'm so excited to graduate. [Ari] I'm going to be sad when you go to school. [Grace] You know my dad... If I don't come back every break, he'll probably move into my dorm room. [Laughing] [Text alerts chiming] Looks like Kiley has a boyfriend now. -Think we'll ever see her again? -Maybe. At her wedding. When we're her bridesmaids. [Laughing] Guess it's just you and me at the prom. Actually, um... Billy asked me. I wanted to tell you the other day, I just didn't want you to feel bad. 'Cause I'm the only one without a boyfriend. Do you ever wonder when you're gonna fall in love? Seriously, Ari. I have much more important things to think about. [♪♪] [Text alert chiming] [Knocking on door] [Isla] Hey Jake! Beer's in the fridge. You live here by yourself? [Isla] Yep. I sleep on my grandmother's couch. Yeah, so I guess you're kind of famous. [Isla] Well, I will be. My goal is to be bigger than Charli d'Amelio. Yeah, he's... He's awesome. Have you been living under a rock? She... she used to be a dancer. Now she's, like, the most followed influencer ever. She makes more money than the CEO of Starbucks. That's not true. No, that's true. For real. No. Just from doing some dumb dance videos? They're not dumb. No, no. I mean, I just didn't know, all right? Because my stuff is, like, super basic, just skating, but yours, right... ...your stuff... That's fun. You watched some of my stuff? I watched all of your stuff. That's what took me so long to DM you. Did you follow me? Yeah. Yeah? Okay, I didn't, but don't kill me. I'm just playin'! You have such a great smile. [♪♪] Wow. Aren't we a little old for this? I always wanted a puppy. Something hard in someone's pocket. What is this? My dad gave it to me. That's sharp. Let's put this bad boy to sleep for the night. Am I staying the night? I don't like to wake up alone. [♪♪] Somebody order pancakes? Who taught you that move? Well... When dad was deployed and mom was at work, I cooked for my sisters. Do you like? I like. [Exhales] Who taught you that? I've been around. I bet you scare the hell outta guys. You don't scare me, though. [♪♪] Isla. Table 12 wants dessert. Hi. Here you go. One for you. Let me know if you guys need anything. Is that him again? What's so special about this one? He's not like the other guys, cam. He gets me. Oh, so you mean he's crazy! No. Look at this. Is that a gun? His dad's in the army. My gosh, 17 likes. His insta is literally crying out for my help. Maybe he's the one who needs help. Look, I know you, Isla. You fall fast and hard, then it's me you call at 3:00 A.M. To pick up the pieces when some loser with a gun breaks your heart. Jeez, cam, don't be such a downer. I'm your friend. Okay, well, as my friend, can you take table 12's orders while I finish this conversation? -Please? -Sure. Thank you. You're so welcome. -You got the next table. -Yeah. Check. Checkmate. And a winning move for Dr. Grace Heinemann! On her way to grand master... And the best veterinarian in Oregon. [Laughing] You just think I'm perfect. You are perfect. Look at you... Brains, beauty, the girl with everything. Not everything. What do you mean? I could really use my own car? [Chuckles] Well, keep saving your money. I know, I know. New game? Sure. Okay. Let's dance. Whoo! [Isla laughs] [♪♪] [Isla laughs] Jake! You should post this. You'd get a lot of likes. Nah. What's the point? People would think you're cool. And you'd make new friends. Maybe I don't want any friends. So why'd you move back here anyway? Did your dad get, like, transferred? Um, no... No, he died. I'm... I'm so sorry, Jake. I didn't know. Did he, um... Did he die in the war or something? No. I ran away 13 times. How come? My mom and dad were always fighting. And... My mom was always going out on my dad. And then, one day, she just went out and never came back. That's rough. Yeah, but... Here I am. A star on the rise. I can only look up from here, right? I don't know. Yeah. I can't believe I let you talk me into a movie about a neurotic dog. I thought it was cute. Hi, ladies. Can I take your order? Uh, grace, you can go first. I'll have a salad and some yam fries, please. Okay. I love your necklace. Thank you. Uh, I'll have the spaghetti Bolognese. Sure. Okay. He was totally checking you out. OMG. What do I do? Do you want me to go with you? Yes. No. I don't know. I'm gonna wait in the car. Okay. You got this. -Hi. -Hi. Okay, so, your name is grace... And... You like yam fries. And you have a pretty smile. So what are you doing right now? [♪♪] You know, my dad used to take me fishing here when I was a kid. I forgot how beautiful it was. Very beautiful. Are you going to college? Yeah. I want to be a veterinarian. Cool. A lot of vets don't treat small farm animals, like chickens and ducks, but I'm going to include them in my practice. Sounds like a lot of school? It's kind of like med school. And then there's residency, where you can focus on specific types of animals, like equine or avian. Anyway, that's... That's the plan. That's a hell of a plan. My dad taught me to play chess there at those tables. [Jake] Oh, yeah? What do you like to do? Me? Stay up late, skate, music, party. Do you party? -I, uh... -That's a no? Do you go to Sheldon? Marist. The private religious school? Yeah. Are you a genius? No. -I think you are. -No! [Jake] Nice girls like you never go for guys like me. Can I see your hand? This is what got me a merit badge in nature crafts. Wow. -Picture? -Yeah. [Click] You're my nature girl. [♪♪] Hey, honey. Did you have a nice walk with Kiley at the park? I wasn't with Kiley. Or Ari. I met someone. Oh, honey. His name is Jake. He's a senior, too. Well, I can't wait to meet him. Kiley? Can PR wait until after we're done cleaning? Check this out. Looks like our local star's up to 7,000 followers. And she's got herself a hot boyfriend! Wait, isn't that... [♪♪] [Text alert chimes] [Jake] You posted that video? Even after I told you I didn't want you to, you did it anyway. Okay, well, before you go off on me, did you even check your social? No. Go on! 600 people saw this? No. That's just you. All of my followers saw it on my account, too. And look at your comments. Girls think you're really hot. Couples content sells well... And I thought it would make you happy if people liked you. My bad. "Gonna be stalking the skate park." "Respectfully, he is a work of art." "I love his smile." "Does he have a brother?" [♪♪] [Grace] I'm sorry. Are you mad? At you? Why? I don't know. I shouldn't ask you about dancing with pretty girls. You're pretty, grace. You're more than pretty. You're smart, and that's the reason I like you so much. It looked like you liked her. Nah. It was just for her social. She cares about that kind of stuff. And you don't? -Care? -No. If you don't believe me, I'll delete my account. You'd do that for me?

I meant another video. -[Text alert buzzing] -Right. Nah. I'm not really into it. Is that all you want then? Just to skate around an empty pool in Hayesville for the rest of your life? Not all of us want to be a star. People will tell you that they love you and then they'll leave. Being famous is better. Yeah. Being loved for what you're not by people you don't know. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry, okay? I just... What, you're going to listen to me now?

[Grace] For me? How'd you know I liked unicorns? Well, you posted a photo from your room, and that's a lot of unicorns. You know it's not my birthday. No, but... It's exactly one month since the day we met. I... She's beautiful. Yeah... Just like you. You're kind like a unicorn, grace. A magical creature that... I didn't know could be real. I want every day to be like this. Me too. But... I've got a job, and we go to different schools... It's okay. We'll see each other when we can. [Dad] Good morning, sunshine. We are making your favorite. I want to go to Sheldon high. Sheldon? Absolutely not. Honey, you can't transfer senior year when you're applying to colleges like Cornell. Actually, I'll have an even better chance getting into my reach schools coming from a public school, because not as many kids apply. What about your education? Sheldon isn't even a charter school. They have the exact same aps... And their own 4h chapter... Which Marist does not. I already talked to a program coordinator. Grace... We have been planning for this since you started high school. Plans change. Ari and Kylie are there. This is my life! Grace, what has gotten into you? You're always talking about how you never thought you'll be able to have a baby, that I was the best thing that's ever happened to you. Then why don't you care about the best thing that's ever happened to me? What could be at Sheldon high school? A boy named Jake. Transfer out of a top school for some boy she just met? What about everything we've invested? Summer programs, college tours. She's not going to throw away everything we've given her for this... Jake. Mark, we've given her a lot. You hear about kids dating online... Sexting. If she's going to have a boyfriend... Let him be real and not virtual. Let me see. I can't believe you're here. We've all got the same third period. You're gonna love Ms. G. She's really cool. -She is. -I really like her. So you were saying there's a test today in Spanish... Come on, grace. Let's go. Come on. -[School bell rings] -It's okay, it's okay. [Teacher] Meet Juliet. Likes moonlit nights on the balcony, telling secrets to my nurse. Dislikes: Family obligations, arranged marriages. In a relationship with Romeo. Mood: Suicidal. [Chuckling] And for your next assignment: Add some facts to Romeo or Juliet's profile. There you go. Thank you. Ms. G ... This is our best friend, grace. She just transferred. She was top of her class at Marist. Nice to meet you, grace. May I ask what made you transfer? I plan on going to veterinary school and I can enroll in Pre-vet classes at OSU from here. Never had a teacher give homework on Instagram. Hey, if you can't beat 'em, reach 'em, right? You have your own account, I'm assuming. Yeah. But I see my friends all the time so I don't really post much. What a radical idea... Hanging out with actual humans. Then you won't have any trouble with my policy... All cell phones go in here during class. Okay. -Bye, Ms. G. -See you tomorrow. Bye, Ms. G. Bye. Jake didn't even say hi? Maybe he didn't see me. Come on, grace, he ignored us. Ugh. My Instagram feed is so boring. Why don't we look at Jake's? Maybe we'll get some ideas. You can't. He deleted his insta for me. He did? Let's check that out. Jake... Carter... Is that a gun? He didn't delete his Instagram, he just blocked you so you wouldn't see. Oh, no. You should send him that. [Text alert chimes] [Text alert chimes] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Engine accelerates] [Jake] I didn't mean to hurt you. I just didn't want you to feel bad. If she doesn't mean anything, I don't understand why you'd want to be with her. Don't take this the wrong way, but... Things are simple in your world, you know? You've got two parents, right? I don't. You live in the house that you grew up in. I don't. You're going to college. I'm not. You're in ap. I'm stuck with the morons. You're not dumb. Most of us wanna escape real life, grace. Having sex with a random girl is an escape? No... But being wanted is. I want you, Jake. No, I don't deserve a girl like you. Yes, you do. -No, I don't. -Yes, you do. How many guys have you been with? You're the first. The first... The first what? The first guy I've ever loved. Are you sure? Okay. [♪♪] [Notification alert chimes] [♪♪] [Text alert chimes] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Clicking screenshots] [♪♪] [♪♪] Get out! Get out of my house! What the hell? Get out of my house! What is going on? Calm down! You cheated on me! You cheated on me! You cheated on me! -You're a liar! -You're crazy! Get out! I'm not crazy! You're a liar! -Get out! -Isla! Get out of my house, Jake! Get out! [Slams] I'm not crazy! [♪♪] Hello, friends. So, I have been seeing this guy, and this is what he said to me... While on the same day this is what he was saying to her. If you're this girl and you're watching this, you need to wake the hell up. If he's in my bed, he's not your man! And for everyone else watching right now, to all of my people, just remember... That a bad boy is like a stray dog. You never know where they've been, or when they're gonna bite. So you bite first. [Phone buzzing] Cami, I'm hurting. Did you check your social? I know. I rage posted. How bad is it? Girl, it's blowing up! What? Yep. You hit 10,000 followers for being all pissed off. What? Oh, my gosh. "I can't believe anyone would cheat on someone as cool as you." "He's a psycho." "He's a loser." "We want a part two." "We want a part two." Oh, my gosh, cam. Cam, everybody wants a part two. There's, like, hundreds of likes on all of these comments, asking for a part two. I can't believe this. [♪♪] Grace! She called you out! How did she get your texts? I don't know! "Who is this girl?" "Look at how she dresses." "What's up with her hair?" "What's he doing with her?" "She's in my class. Shy, brainy type." "Team Isla 100%." [Grace] She's pretty and thin and sexy. And she has her own apartment! I can't compete with her! Then don't. Forget him. Yeah, grace. You'll be off to college soon and he'll be stuck here with Isla and all the other hundreds of skanky ho's who follow him. Sorry. Just trying to be a friend. I know. Thanks, Kiley. Yeah, thanks. I can't be that girl. Yeah, not if you curl up into a ball and give up. That sounds like a good plan. I can't! I love him! That's why she needs to get out now. That's why we help her get him. Kiley, do you actually think we can? We show Jake that you can be just as sexy as Isla. You have any photos of you in the bathtub? You and Jake making out? Guys love that. Are you kidding? My mom has my password. She sends screenshots off my insta to my grandmother. That's why we make a finsta. A fake Instagram? This just gets worse by the second. It's private. You only let your friends follow you, so your parents and teachers and stuff can't see. Everyone has a finsta. And this helps grace because... Because Jake will follow grace's finsta and see that she can be just as sexy as Isla. We're gonna need more than cute selfies at the beach, though. Grace, you're better than this. You don't have to go there. [♪♪] [♪♪] Isla! Hi, I'm Ginny Moore. It's so nice to meet you! Wow, you are even prettier in person. Oh, thank you, Ginny. That's because I've been using all of your products. Awesome. Awesome. Well, we are looking for the right person to talk about our brand, and we are excited about the possibility of you telling all of your followers about us. Me too. I've been researching a lot about how beauty brand influencer marketing is, like, the most effective form of digital advertising to get people to try new products. True... When the influencer is someone trustworthy. We want our influencers to talk about their lives and how our products make it better, bring the consumers into their home, their lifestyle, share what they eat for breakfast. That's perfect for me. You know, your followers really seem to care about you, Isla. What do you think the appeal is? Well, Ginny, I'm fun and I'm real. I'm the kind of girl who, you know, you want to go to a party with, because we'll dance our asses off and we'll talk to a lot of cute boys, but then at the end of the night, I'll always make sure that everyone gets home safe. And that's what my appeal is. I think I'm just the kind of girl that everybody wants for their best friend. Well, let's open the box. Wow! [♪♪] I'm officially an influencer! [Giggles] [Shrieks happily] [Jake] I think your friend, Ari, hates me. She's just protective. All she knows is what she's seen. She doesn't know you like I do. Maybe she's right. There's things that you don't know. All I need to know is that I am the one. Who else could it be? The way you look at me. All right, I'd better go. Wait. One second. [Clicking] I should've put on makeup. I look like I'm in middle school. Who's gonna look at your face? Watch this. Too bad you can't make me look skinny. Says who? Watch. Well, it's grace... Sort of. -I like it. -Yeah? I can't believe I nailed that trick. [Girl] Hey, Jake. Just saw you on Isla's new post. So after I threw his ass out for cheating, here are some things he left at the house. Socks. His lighter. Underwear. And this really creepy army knife. Let me know what you guys want to see in part three. I was thinking we take a trip to Portland for your birthday. We could visit all those vintage stores that you like. No need. I'm getting free clothes from therapy boutique now. Really? Are they just giving away clothes? No, it's only for me. It's because I've been promoting their store in my posts and sales are actually going up because of it. Congratulations. And that's just the beginning. That's great. You heard anything from your mom? You know, dad, it's not your fault... ...that she doesn't call on my birthday. No, it's not right. No matter what happened between us, a girl needs her mom. I have my followers now. Honey, it's not the same. Dad, it's better. Are you excited about graduation, Jake? Yes, ma'am. Yeah. But I might be short just a couple of credits, 'cause we moved around a lot, my dad being in the military and all. Well, can't they let you make up the extra classes so you can graduate with everyone else? They could, but I don't really have the time because I work 40 hours a week at the Bella bistro. Oh... You work a full-time job and you go to school? Yes, ma'am. And I help my grandmother with the shopping and cleaning. Where are you applying to college, Jake? I'm not really sure I'm going to take that route, Mr. Heinemann. I hear they have good college scholarships for veteran families. How do you like Sheldon, Jake? It's pretty good. Yeah. My old school didn't have as many kids... And certainly no one like grace. Well, let's hope the colleges she's applying to think the same thing. [Jake] Why wouldn't they? There may be other smart kids out there, sure, but... They'll never find anyone who cares as much as grace does. That's beautifully put, Jake. How's prom coming along, honey? Good. The theme is going to be "fire and ice". I hear Sheldon's proms are legendary. I think you're going to love it. [Phone chimes] Sorry. That's me. Grandma checking in. Of all the boys in Hayesville, why him? Broke and going nowhere. Did you see her? She was glowing. College is her dream. And she's done everything right. Just give her some time to have some fun before she takes her ticket and boards the train. And what do we do until then? Trust her. [Jake] Your mom is a really great cook. Way better than Mac and cheese. I want you to follow me. You girls and your social media. I already do. [Whoosh, chime] You like? It... It doesn't seem like you. I'm changing. I... Can't afford a real one, but you'll save a lot on dog food. You got balls showing up here. Yeah, now that 8,000 of your followers hate me. That's up to 13,000 now. And they don't hate you... They're just in love with me. I guess... You have that effect on people. Happy birthday. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] You didn't answer my texts. Grace, I was in class. You left dinner at my house and went to her! Grace, chill out. We need to talk after school. I can't. A couple of the guys are going to WJ's skate park. Are you actually going skating or are you going to her house? It was her birthday. She was alone. I felt bad. I can't do this! Hey, you know how this works. You film something, you throw a whole bunch of effects on it. It was nothing. Well, it looked like something to 8,000 people, Jake! Did you read any of the comments? "You make a hot couple." "Hope you work it out." Who cares what a bunch of strangers online say? We know what's real, right? And if you want a stuffed dog for your birthday, I'll get you one. I already have one. I want you. You got me. Just not today. Come on. I'll walk you to your next class. We got the last two spots on the college tour. Yeah, great. Actually, do we have to go? Do we have to go on the college tour you've been bugging me about for an entire year? It's just all happening so fast. I don't know if I'm ready. How's everything going with Jake? Fine. 'Cause, lately, it seems like you've just been buried in your screen. He works, remember? And I have to check to see what's up with the prom committee. Honey, I know that it might feel scary to leave home, but I promise you college is going to be a wonderful experience. Okay, mom. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Click] [♪♪] Ms. Gordon, grace says that you're everyone's favorite teacher. I don't know if I'm their favorite, but they know they can come to me when they need help. I know that grace is new here and you don't know her very well, but... I don't have any one else I can turn to. I can't talk about this with my pastor, and... My husband... This would kill him. This isn't the grace I know. She's such a sensible girl, you know? It's that boy. He's changed everything. I'm afraid for her. It's like she will say or do anything to get him. Have you tried talking to her? I'll lose her trust if she finds out that I violated her privacy, but, yes, I have tried talking to her about Jake, but she just... She just shuts me out, and I don't know what to do. I think the best thing to do right now is I keep an eye on her at school, and you continue to do so at home, and if I see anything more, I will let you know. Okay. This is insane. You get free stuff just for dancing in your underwear, chugging Tequila and kissing a stuffed dog. She's almost got 14,000 followers. That's like advertising on a hit sitcom. When I have a daughter, she's not going to spend all day on her phone. She's not even going to have social media. What are you going to do... Lock her in a castle? Yes. So, did Jake ask you to the prom yet? He's been busy working and hanging out with these skaters. Who he met thanks to Isla's videos. I have to do something. Fight back. A prom invite is kind of critical, but once you get that, you can use it. So I've got to get him to ask me. I mean, if he was any kind of boyfriend, he would've asked you already. Why don't you ask him? And they told me that they want me to post everything about my life. I seriously think this is gonna be our ticket out of this place. And I also wanna be the next Loren gray now because she's been around for a long time, and she still has 53 million followers and makes, like, $5 million a year. -Five million? -Yeah. With that, we could... Oh, boy. We could? Get a fancy place in New York or something. That's everything I've ever wanted. Damn, I'm late for work. [Alert buzzes] Jake, if you're not going to prom with me, I'm going to take someone else. He's typing! Grace, if you went to prom with me, this is what I'd do. That's so cool! -Oh! -You're going to prom! [Shrieking] It worked! It worked!! If you want her to back off, you have to fight on her turf. Okay. Let's make a video. -Yes. -Okay. -Okay, stand here. -Okay. This side. Right there. And... -Ready? -Mm-hmm. -Listen, Isla... -No! No names. Just say "you" or "this girl". Okay. -You acted like a slut... -Nope. Bullying gets you banned. And plus, you don't want to say something that might be used against you later. Try again. You said things about me that weren't true... Weak. You need to be more forceful. Call her out more. Come on, grace! You hooked up with my boyfriend and tried to make it look like you were together. But does this look like love? Or does this? You called him a dog, but he only got you that stuffed puppy because he felt sorry for you. Because you don't actually have a boyfriend. So if you think that a guy leaving a pair of socks at your house after a hook-up makes him your man, check out part two... My promposal. Grace, if you went to prom with me, this is what I'd do. Isla, you've got three orders up! Isla? Ready. [Gasping] Oh, my goodness. -Gorgeous! -You like? Yes, queen. -Stay right there. -Okay. -Ready? -Yeah. You've got to pose. Oh, my goodness! So pretty! Come on, pose. Give us something. There we go! Do a little twirl. Little twirl. Oh, so pretty! Now you have to post this. Love that. Isn't this going to stir things up? Yes. That's the point. When is this going to end? As soon as she sees that Jake chose me and she goes away. You told me... You said after six months, you'd move me up to shift manager. Look. The owner's son came back from college and he got the gig. Sorry. You still gonna work your shift? So now she's on social media, my views dropped, I have lost a ton of followers, and I haven't gotten any new products in a week. Okay, chill, isles. I don't want to burn you. Grace, you're fugly and I hope you die! No, no. You are not going to post that. You're not an influencer, cami. You don't get it. And you won't be either if you get shadowbanned for posting inappropriate content. Come on, Isla, I thought you said you and Jake were no big thing. Well, I still have an image to maintain, cami... ...and I don't want to be the one who gets left again. Come on. I'm really glad you decided to stop by. I saw your post... With that guy, Jake... He's history. [Text alert chimes] [Alert chimes] [♪♪] I knew you'd be back. [♪♪] I can't believe you. You asked me to the prom, then went to her house! You betrayed me! She just posted this! Tell me right now. Her or me? I can't answer that. Don't leave. Jake, no! Jake! -Jake! -I can't do this! Grace... I'm sorry. You okay? I didn't mean to. Show me, show me, show me. I told you. I didn't mean it. I swear. I told you, I am bad news. You're right. You are. Look, grace, you're a good person. You need to be the one walking away. And Isla's not... So she gets to be with you? When my dad died, I don't know, my whole world, it just... It just closed in on me... ...and I just started doing things just to forget... And I know the things that I'm doing aren't right, but I can't stop doing them. I don't see that. That's because you don't want to! Do you know the difference between you and Isla? You see me for everything that I could be and she just sees me for everything that I really am. And I have been holding on to both of you... For too long. We have to let it go. It's okay, baby. I know what to do. We can't tell Ari about this. You're just gonna talk to her, right? [Indistinct conversation] Grace! ...and then we go out. Watch out! Stop! Hello, ma'am. Are you the owner of the Van that's parked in the driveway? And were you driving around a '50s diner yesterday around, say, 6:00 P.M.? No. My daughter, grace, was using the car. There was a report of grace and a friend harassing a girl named Isla masters. She was driving the car towards Isla, trying to scare her. Apparently, it's over a boy that they're both involved with. Miss masters filed a complaint. I'm sorry, officer. I've never had any problems with my daughter. She's a straight-a student. She's at the top of her class. Okay, luckily, ma'am, no one got hurt. Stay away from each other, young lady. Thank you, ma'am. Grace, what were you thinking? You don't understand. I understand that you almost blew your entire future. You could have hurt that girl... And for what? For a boy who's with another girl? Jake loves me. And I love him. He's your first... And that's special, but this fight has to end. I want grace heinemann to be happy! The little girl who loves unicorns, who has the same friends since kindergarten, who plays chess with her dad. I'm not a child anymore. Grace... Listen to me. I'm worried about you. I want to be alone. -Grace, if you just... -Get out! I said, get out! Right now! Hello, friends. I am an emotional person, so when bad things happen to me. I just need to talk it out, so here it goes. As you know, I have been seeing this guy, and there have been some ups and downs. But he is not the problem. She is. This girl here got obsessed with him and then she started stalking me, and it started off with just watching my stories, which I didn't think much of at the time, but then she started spreading lies about me, then she got obsessed with me, and she tried to hit me with her minivan. They were going by so fast, that I only saw two heads fly right by me. It was really, really scary, you guys. Thankfully, I am okay, but I did get a picture of their license plate, which I took to the police, and I'm going to share it with you guys here. She said two heads? Why didn't you talk her out of it? I didn't know what she was going to do. I didn't want her to be alone! She needs a friend, Kylie, not an accomplice! [♪♪] [Line ringing] Hey, you've reached Jake. Leave a message. [♪♪] [Tires squealing] [Line ringing] Hi, it's grace. Leave me a message. Grace... Where are you going? [Phone buzzing] Grace, come on, let's just go home now. She already filed a complaint against you, it's like they said, if I want Jake, I have to fight for him. Who said? You can't listen to people on social media! They're not your friends! [Phone buzzing] Who's calling? My mom. Grace! [Busy tone] Hey! Stop buzzing me, you crazy bitch! Stay away from my man! You can have Jake, I don't care... But you do not mess with my career. If you had real aspirations in life, you'd know the difference between your stupid little girl posts and my business, but you don't! I have the followers, I have the receipts. My posts are viral, yours are nothing, so just stop... You can't win! And if I don't, what are you going to do about it? I will freaking kill you! Get down here, Isla. We're not done! Isla! [♪♪] [♪♪] Hey, bro. Hey, man. [Brakes screeching] [Brakes screeching] -Hey! -Grace, no! Grace, stop! [Crowd shouting] Grace, stop! Grace, stop! [♪♪] [Jake] Move, move! [Stabbing] Do something! Why are you guys standing there? I need emergency! Someone's been hurt! I just need someone stat, please! Someone, give me an address! [♪♪] [♪♪] Grace you're okay. You're okay. [♪♪] Grace heinemann, a 12th-grade student at Sheldon high school, has been stabbed to death after she and another teenager got in a fight over a boyfriend they both share. Isla masters, 19, is presently being held under suspicion of murder pending a trial. [♪♪] Hey, Jake, I got a bunch of strange calls. They say that there's a killer working here. I think it might be better if you stayed home until all this dies down. [♪♪] [Organ playing] [♪♪] [♪♪] You were at that party with grace, weren't you? So many of you were there, and none of you did anything? Not one of you lifted a finger to help? Kiley? How does this happen? How do you care more about posting a fight than stopping it? How did you let my little girl die? Honey. [Door rattling] As of right now, you're being charged with second-degree murder, but that could change. English loves to play hardball. Watched too many episodes of law and order. Alex English. That's the d.A. I've been appointed as your lawyer... Lindsay rice... Call me lr... We don't have a lot of time. I'd like you to consider pleading to a lesser charge of manslaughter. You want me to say I did it and go to prison? Yes, but for a lot less time and a quicker parole. She came to my work and tried to run me down! There's a witness! Self-defense is a pretty tough sell when she used her fists and you had a knife. She harassed me! Like you harassed Seth disilva? The police were called when he tried to break up with you. He filed a complaint. That's ancient history. Almost one year to the day of grace's death. English will use that to show your previous violent nature and your pathological attachment to boyfriends. The complaint you filed will help, but I don't think a judge will believe your story. It's not a story! I've seen your social media. You had quite the following. Have. And you put this feud center stage. That raises the issue of premeditation, usually hard to prove, except when there's a series of viral posts, seen by as many people as there are seats at a football game. Establishing premeditation changes the charge... To first-degree murder. But she... She just kept punching me. And I was looking around, and there was blood everywhere, but it was mine... And I just thought... I just thought that if I showed her the knife, that she would stop, and I... I never meant... I didn't... I never wanted her to... I need names, dates, anything I should know that would help or hurt your defense. And I'm recommending a bench trial. That means no jury. Only the judge deciding your fate. What about Jake? Would he have to testify? If there's a trial, he'd be called as a witness. And you would ask him about me and grace and how he felt and everything? He'd be under oath. I'd try to show how he played you against each other, yes. So then people would be on my side. Isla, getting a judge to believe you isn't the same as getting followers. We go to trial, we're rolling the dice with your life. So... Plea? I want to prove my innocence. Name: Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. Home: London, 1890. Occupation: Doctor or psychopath. Personal interests: Exploring the human psyche or killing people. So which one are you? Let me put it another way... Is the real you the person you post online? The whole idea is to be different. But how different? Is the real you Dr. Jekyll, but you turn into Mr. Hyde when you post online? I guess when you see somebody's posts, you don't really know their whole story. [Reporter] Today at the trial of Isla masters, the court will hear from the defense, and from 19-year-old masters herself. Masters is charged in the death of grace heinemann. If masters is convicted of first-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life in prison. [Gavel pounding] Mr. Carter, in October of last year, did you have a relationship with grace heinemann or Isla masters? Both of them. And were you serious with either one of them? I'm not serious with anybody. Oh, so friends with benefits? [Jake] I wouldn't say that. Well, what would you say? I guess it just made me feel good. That I was somebody two girls liked enough to fight over. Did you encourage them to fight over you? [Jake] No. I... No, I never wanted any of that. Everybody on social media did. They just kept pushing and pushing until... Well... Thank you, Mr. Carter. That's all, your honor. Your witness, Ms. Rice. But you didn't try and stop the feud. You kept on playing both these girls, knowing you were inciting them to violence. Objection, your honor. Let's move on, Ms. Rice. Why did you come back to Hayesville? To live with my grandmother after my dad died. Why did you come back to live with your grandmother? Because I was having some issues. In fact, you were arrested for beating someone up, weren't you? Yeah. Yeah, he made a joke about my dad. That's it? You put someone in the hospital for a joke? He said maybe it was my fault that my dad killed himself. So you came back to Hayesville, looking to start some new fights. Come on. I wanted to get away from all of that. I was just trying to be somewhere else and be someone else. And Isla masters made you that someone else? Yeah. Yes. And grace heinemann made you someone else. Yes. These girls created you. Because, in fact, you're nothing more than a high school kid with a record. By continuing to play both these girls, you fueled their fight? [Jake] It was just words. I never thought that they would fight for real. You didn't think about them at all, did you, Mr. Carter? I guess that's what I did. [Rice] And what was your dream? I wanted to be an influencer. Somebody who people could look up to. Somebody who helped other people find their dreams. And grace stood in the way of your dream. That's why you hated her. I didn't hate her. I... I honestly didn't even know her. Did you know she was following you to the party? No. I just went to see Jake. Then why did you bring the knife? Because I was afraid of her... ...and I thought that if she saw it, that she would leave me alone. But she followed me there, and she came after me, and she wouldn't stop. I honestly don't even remember pulling out the knife. I never wanted any of this. [Rice] Thank you, Isla. So, miss masters, you wanted to be an Internet celebrity who gets paid for dancing in a bikini, is that it? No. There's a lot more to it than that. But you did dance in a bikini, right? So does Charli d'Amelio. Is that a crime? And grace stood in your way because people stopped following you after they witnessed your actions towards her. Is that correct? Yes, but I had receipts to prove that she was lying. Receipts... That's... This is a social media term? Yes, it means, like, proof, or evidence. Well, since you're such an expert on social media, then you do know what filters are? Yes. Everybody uses them. Mm-hmm. To make them look better than they actually are. Well, I don't know anybody who wants to look worse. Well, isn't that what you're doing right now? Trying to sell us this idealized version of a nice girl, when you yourself are a killer? -Objection. -Sustained, Mr. English. Your honor, this video was made the moment before the fight where grace was stabbed. It establishes that miss masters went to the party with expressed intention... To kill miss heinemann. [Isla, on video] You can have Jake! I don't care! But you do no mess with my career! If you had real aspirations in life, you'd know the difference between your stupid little girl posts and my business! But you don't! I have the followers! I have the receipts! My posts are viral, yours are nothing! So just stop! You can't win! [Grace] And if I don't? What are you going to do about it? [Isla] I will freaking kill you! [English] Miss masters... Is that you? Yes. [Gavel banging] Your sentencing is set for next week. A lot of people will be speaking on your behalf. Your dad, cami, your boss from the restaurant... ...and your mother. My mom's gonna tell everyone that she ran out on us? Is that a good idea? I hope so. That's why I asked her. How long? I'm hoping for 15 years. Given your age, we might have a shot. [♪♪] [♪♪] [Sobs] [Isla] Dear grace, I talk to you every day, and will for the rest of my life. I have a lot of time to think now, and I play back everything. I should have never said those horrible words to you, and I will never forgive myself for how things ended. I was just so caught up in what other people would think that I didn't take the time to reflect on what was actually happening. If only I could have understood it then. Things could have been so different. I really think we could have been friends. [♪♪]
