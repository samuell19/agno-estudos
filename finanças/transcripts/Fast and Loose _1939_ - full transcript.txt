Captioning made possible by Turner entertainment group Joel. Joel. The phone is ringing. Well, what do you expect it to do? Sing? Maybe it's important. Probably is. Maybe the building is on fire. No. Mmm. I do all the work around here while you lie... Hello. It's Christopher Oates. He's babbling incoherently about something. Yeah. Give it to me. Hello. Joel Sloane speaking. At the sound of the musical note, it will be... Oh! Oh. Oh. Ahem. Well, ahem. I'll, uh, I'll meet you at my office... In about an hour. Yeah. How do you feel? Oh, I feel wonderful, I think. What did we have to eat last night? Fried carpets? Oh, I feel as if I swallowed a jam session, jitterbugs and all. What did Oates want? Oh, I don't know. He belled about something important. I hope he can remember what it is until he gets to the office. Darling, did you notice what I did with my left hand last night? Never mind. I got it. I don't know who you are, my friend, but if you'll stand still, I'll shave you. Careful. And don't trip. The mailman probably left a giant stack of orders for us to fill. Looks like the rare book business has crawled into a hole to die. Not that business is so bad. It's just that our budget is usually miles ahead of it. Every time we make a sale, we throw a party. We should have asked the landlord to some of those parties. Now he's mad at us. Listen to this. "This is to advise you that unless "payment in full is made within 10 days, "your stock and fixtures will be sold at auction." Oh. It's too bad they abolished slavery. You'd bring a nice price. Oh, darling, what are we going to do? Pay, of course. With money? Certainly. I wish somebody would steal a lot of rare books from a museum or a library. Then I could recover them and collect a nice, fat reward. No. You are not going to play bloodhound again. But, darling... no. I remember the last time you turned detective. Perfect strangers were firing at you as if you were a duck in a shooting gallery. Yes, darling, it's true I did get shot once, but that was when my back was turned. Your back was turned, all right. Look at these air-conditioned breeches. Well, it didn't amount to much. It was only a flesh wound. It was only a flesh wound, all right. You certainly looked undignified sitting around in this thing for 6 weeks. Now, look here... I don't want you getting into trouble. I worry when somebody shoots you. Now, the first thing you know, I'll have circles under my eyes. Well, we got to raise the money somehow. Sidewalk's staring us in the face right now. Well, I'll take in floors to scrub. I'll help. Besides, darling, we still have Oates. He's rich. He'll buy lots of books. Now let's see what sort of a salesman you are. But he's screwy. I know, but he's just as rich as he is screwy. Nobody could be that rich. His firm had to retire him, because he never could remember what business they were in. He is a bit absent-minded. There. You see? He's not so bad. He found the door all by himself. Oh, hello, Mr. Oates. Hello, Joel. No, no, no. I'm Mrs. Sloane. Look. So you are. So you are! Right this way. The rare book market has reached a new high. You may quote me. Here's Joel, Mr. Oates. Good morning, Joel. Good morning, Mr. Oates. Have a chair. Well, what do you want? Why did you send for me? No, no, no. No. You called me, Mr. Oates. You said it was important. Important? Important? I should say so. Now, this must be kept absolutely private. Nicholas Torrent is in the gravest financial difficulty. Who isn't? Torrent needs cash. This is the time to make him an offer for his Shakespeare manuscript. Oh, you're crazy. Torrent sell the only scrap of Shakespeare manuscript in the whole world? A little throwaway worth about half a million dollars? Never. I want you to act as my agent in this deal. You make all the arrangements. See that I don't pay too much for the manuscript. And naturally, I'll pay the usual commission. Money is no... No... Object? Right. Spare no expense, Joel. Leave no stone, uh, no stone, uh... Un-turned. Thank you. Uh, uh, uh... Not in there. That's the, uh... This way, please. Mr. Oates. Ah, now you've got it. If you see a wolf at the door, tell him to beat it. He's got the wrong address. But can you do it? Can you get in touch with Torrent? The little woman asks me if I can get in touch with Torrent. Ha ha ha! Do you remember Phil Sergeant, my pal, my protege, the man for whom I did countless favors? Mm-hmm. Hello. Mr. Sergeant, please. He is now working as librarian and secretary for, uh, guess who. Nicholas Torrent? Right. Now watch me go. Hello. Phil? Phil, this is Joel Sloane. Yes. Phil, I wanted to ask a little favor of you. It's very important that I get in touch with your boss about a matter that... I'm really sorry, Joel. If I could make an appointment with Mr. Torrent for you, I'd do it like a shot. Why, no, of course he's not in any financial difficulty. What ever gave you that idea? Well, no. I'm afraid it wouldn't do any good to ask him. Sorry, Joel. Something is wrong, Garda. Why should Phil Sergeant try to stall me of all people? Why should he try and keep me away from Torrent? And why should he tell me that Torrent is ok financially? Do you suppose Oates imagined the whole thing? No. Our absent-minded client is pretty smart about money matters. I've got a hunch that Torrent is in trouble. And what worries me more so is Phil. So are we. That fixes everybody. When I first met Phil, he didn't know a first edition from a hole in the ground. I taught him what rare books were. Why people pay big prices for them. I put him in business. Now he brushes me off like a... A... A bill collector. Quiet. I don't want to hear any more about that. Darling, I'm sure Phil appreciates every little thing you've ever done for him. Maybe he wasn't feeling so well today. I think I'll go and see Dave Hilliard. Maybe his insurance company can give me some information. If a customer comes in with money in his pocket, shoot first and ask questions afterward. Hey. Sure. No. That's all right. No. No. I'll take care of it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you back. How are you, Joel? Fine. Thank you, David. I've got a couple of things... All right. What are we laughing at? Your head. Well, it feels all right. Don't look all right. It's all tied up with ribbons like a baby's bonnet. Oh. One of my wife's little tricks. Cute, isn't she? Yeah. Dave, you might be able to help me make a big sale, and I could use one right now. What's the matter? The sheriff howling on your doorstep? No, but you know how it is. Rare books are an expensive luxury these days. First editions cost a lot of money, and nobody's got it. Ha ha. I've got a customer for Nicholas Torrent's Shakespeare manuscript. Now, I didn't want to approach Torrent cold just as a stranger. Did you say Nicholas Torrent? Yeah. I know you handle his insurance, and I thought you might help pave the way for me. I see what you mean. Joel, if I start you off right with Nicholas Torrent, will you do something for me? Whatever it is, you consider it done. Here's a first edition of paradise lost. I don't have to tell you how rare or how valuable it is. That book was either lost or stolen from the Torrent library. So far he hasn't made any claim for it, and I happen to know that right now, he needs money very badly. Something funny going on there, eh? And how. We've got over a million dollars worth of insurance on that Torrent collection. Now, I'm going to arrange for you to go out to Torrent's house. And in return, I want you to find out for me just what kind of monkey business is going on in that library. It's a deal. Heh heh. The book. Oh. Well, hello, Joel. Hello, Garda. Mr. and Mrs. Sloane, I'd like to have you meet Mr. Torrent. How do you do, sir? How do you do? How do you do? I'm glad you could get here. Thank you. And Mr. Oates. How do you do, Mr. Oates? No, no. Torrent. Craddock, will you show them to their rooms, please? You can show me directly to the library. I've been waiting for years to see that collection. Oh, that's grand. I'll be delighted to show it to you. Well, what do you think of my little collection, Mr. Sloane? Little collection? Ha! You might as well call the battle of gettysburg a disturbance. It's a pity I can't show you the Shakespeare now, but that's being brought out from the insurance company's vault. Well, you've got a lot of other treasures. I saw a book this morning that you ought to have... Very nice first edition of paradise lost. I have a beautiful one. It's been sent to the binders, Mr. Torrent. Why? It doesn't need binding. The front cover needed some repairs. It'll be returned in a day or 2. Oh. Will you show Mr. Sloane the rest of the collection, Phil? Well, I'll see you for dinner. Right. It's great to see you again, Phil. It's nice to know you're getting along so well. Must be quite a responsibility taking care of all this. Ahem. Well, what do you want? Mr. Sloane, I'd like to have you meet Mr. Wilkes. Oh, how do you do? Mr. Sloane is a dealer in rare books. I know who Mr. Sloane is. Yes, indeed, Mr. Sloane. I know who you are. And what you want. You've come to take the manuscript, haven't you? My manuscript... well, you can't have it. You're not going to take it away. It belongs here, and if you dare... Wilkes, what's the meaning of this? I must apologize for Wilkes, Mr. Sloane. He's been librarian here so long he probably imagines all this is his property. Poor chap. I think he's beginning to lose his mind. It was a hundred miles away a minute ago. Hello, Dave. Hello, Joel. Hello. Mr. Torrent, there's your Shakespeare, safe and sound. Thank you, Mr. Hilliard. Will you have a drink? I'm sorry. I've got to get right back to town. Mr. Torrent, please... would you put that in the safe at once? It gives me the jitters to see it lying around loose. Right away. If you will, please. Would you mind going down to the car with me? Surely. Thank you. Well, what did you find out? Find out about what? About what? About the library. Oh. Did you get a chance to see whether Torrent's paradise lost was missing? No. That is, not yet. Well, get on it, will you? And here's a lead for you. I've learned several important things about Gerald Torrent. Oh, the son and heir. Yeah. A nice, clean-living boy. Only he drinks a lot and gambles heavily and runs around with some pretty shady dames. Huh. No vices, eh? Keep you eyes open, will you? If anything happens to that Shakespeare, a lot of insurance companies will lose their faith in a certain party by the name of Joel Sloane. Yes. I see what you mean, Dave. If I see Joel Sloane, I'll tell him. You must be Mr. Sloane. Yes. Well, I'm Gerald Torrent. Oh. I hope you have a very pleasant weekend, Mr. Sloane. If you'd like to play some golf or a little tennis, I'd be more than glad to oblige. Thank you. That's very kind of you. Oh, hello, Mr. Charlton. Hello, Gerald. How are you? Fine. May I present Mr. Sloane? Mr. Sloane. Mr. Charlton is father's broker. Though we are better friends than that implies. Uncle Vincent! Christina, my dear, you look lovely. This is my little sister. Chris, here's Mr. Sloane. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Sloane. I was coming down to meet you, but I saw uncle Vincent and forgot everything, including my manners. That's quite all right, miss Torrent. I've just been helping Mrs. Sloane. Mother isn't feeling very well, so I'm your hostess till dinner time. May I show you to your room? Yes, of course. I'll see you later, Mr. Charlton. Where's your father, Gerald? He's in the library, Mr. Charlton. Hello, Phil. How are you? Fine. You? Fine. Gerald, your father just inquired about that first edition of paradise lost. Well, what am I going to do about it? Gerald. All right. All right. Keep your shirt on. Vincent. Well, it's good to see you. Sit down. Will you have a drink? No, thanks. Believe me, I hate to bother an old friend like you about your brokerage account. Brokers are supposed to bother people, aren't they? I simply felt that we could advantageously dispose of certain holdings and raise the money that way. Exactly what I'm going to do, Vincent. I'm selling my Shakespeare manuscript. What? It's absolutely necessary. Christopher Oates and his agent are coming down for the weekend, and I expect to raise enough cash to clear up all my debts. I can't let you sell the Shakespeare, Nick. I know how you prized it, what it means to you. Let me carry your account personally for another few months. That's out of the question. I value our friendship too highly to let you carry my burden. As we all know, small oaks from giant acorns, uh, uh... Grow. Thank you. Industry and thrift caused my little grocery to become a great chain of stores extended from coast to... to... to... Coast. Exactly. Coast to coast. You know, last year Mr. Oates disposed of $3 million worth of canned asparagus. Isn't that wonderful? Oh, it was nothing, at all, really. Mr. Sloane, I've got it. Your face has been bothering me all through dinner. Oh, think of me living with him for 2 years, Mr. Charlton. What I mean is I remember now where I've seen you before. You work for the police on some cases involving rare books. Are you a detective, Mr. Sloane? Well, in a small way I help out insurance companies once in a while, but it's only a sideline. Well, tell me, Mr. Sloane. How do rare book thieves operate? Go on, dear. Detect something for the ladies and gentlemen. Well, it's comparatively easy to steal rare books. However, where the thieves usually trip themselves up is in selling their loot. I've often told Torrent that these valuable books are much too loosely protected. Nonsense. Phil can tell me in a minute exactly where everything in the library happens to be. Isn't that so? Yes, of course. We have a good system of indexing. Would you gentlemen like to discuss your business in the library? No naughty stories, now. That goes for you, too. Yes, ma'am. I'll see you in a few minutes. About 10:30? Oh, hello. I was just doing a few setting-up exercises. How did you make out? Well, we get the Shakespeare manuscript, all right, but we're gonna have to give Mr. Torrent Manhattan island and $24 worth of Indians. Ah, that's great. Did you notice that your friend Phil was a little uncomfortable when we talked about stolen books during dinner? Yes, and so was Gerald. When we were in the library, I saw him watching us from the terrace. Oh, grandpa, what big eyes you have. Yeah. I need them in my business. Dave Hilliard told me a few things about Gerald, and if there's any dirty work being done around here, he is doing it. Oh, so... It's Gerald you're after, eh? Come and feast your eyes on this. The view is pretty good from here. Yes. Your friend Phil is out on the terrace with Christina Torrent. Well, he has a nice job, hasn't he? We'd better not come in together. I'll stay out here and smoke a cigarette. All right. But don't brood. About what? Whatever you've been brooding about. Why don't you tell me what it is, Phil? Maybe I can help you. Why, that's nonsense, darling. I'm the happiest man in the world. Mmm. That's proof you're worried about something. Didn't have that old oomph. Well, I haven't been practicing. Come to bed. Don't be such an old snoop. Well, that worries me. There's a boy making $50 a week in love with a very rich girl. Well, when we were married, that's all I was making. He's in charge of a million dollars worth of books. He might... he just might try to augment his income a bit. Oh, I know, but I have a hunch that Phil isn't like that. Ah, young love. She's going in alone so the family won't know they've been out there together. Aw, now, that's cute. Darling, do you remember when we used to do things like that to fool my family? Don't be ridiculous. Your family practically threw you at my head. Hey, that's funny. Car just drove up. Darling, who is it? It's a little old man with crutches. I think I'll go and help him. What was that? I don't know. It sounds like trouble. Hey, give me a hand. My. Vincent. The Shakespeare. Here. Sit down. It's gone! No, not quite. Wouldn't you like to go to your room, Vincent? The manuscript is safe. Can you tell us what happened, Mr. Charlton? I'm afraid there's very little I can tell you. I was alone in the drawing room when I heard someone moving about in here. I came in to investigate. Someone was at the safe with a flashlight, but it was promptly extinguished. Did you get a good look at him? No. It was pitch dark in here. I think you'd better take Mr. Charlton to his room. We can go over this thing in the morning. Lock up, please, Wilkes. Come, darling. You know, Joel, my theory in this is that one of the... Oh, Wilkes. How many people know the combination of this safe. Did Mr. Torrent authorize you to investigate, Mr. Sloane? No, but I'm taking it for granted he would if he knew that you'd been in jail. Forgery, wasn't it? It's an interesting little hobby. That's a lie. Don't you wish it were? Now why don't you tell me about the Shakespeare manuscript? I... i don't know anything. I was in my room. Please, Mr. Sloane. Haven't you locked up yet? Yes, Mrs. Torrent. I... i was just going. We've all had so much excitement tonight, Mr. Sloane. I'm sure you need some sleep. Thank you. I'll, uh... ahem... Get a drink, then I'll go right up to bed. Good night. Good night. What do you want? I'm investigating what happened downstairs tonight. It's none of your business. Yes. I know. That's why I'm investigating. That's your pencil, isn't it? Well, it's got your initials on it. Where did you get that? Downstairs on the floor in the library. Come on. Let's you and I sit down and make ourselves comfortable. Where were you when that rumpus started tonight? That's none of your business. You better get another answer. You're in a rut. I was in bed asleep. Oh, come now, Mr. Torrent. With your shoes on? No. Put it down. Thank you. Tsk tsk. So, that's the renowned Torrent hospitality, eh? Now, look here. If the police are called in on this thing in the morning, you'll be in a mess up to your ears. What were you doing in the library tonight? I wasn't in the library. How did your pencil get there? I don't know. I missed it a few days ago. What were you doing downstairs? Couldn't sleep. Conscience? Oh, my. Come on. All is forgiven. Where did you hide it? I didn't hide anything. It just happens that I don't believe you. And neither will the police. You know, you're a rotten coward, Gerald, to attack Charlton, a man twice your age. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, yes, you do. Charlton caught you trying to steal that manuscript tonight, and you struck him down. Well, you might have killed him! Oh, I didn't. You're mistaken, father. I'm through with you, Gerald. I stood for a great deal, but this finishes us. Tomorrow morning I want you to pack up and get out. What are you doing here? Well, dad, I heard your voice... Go back to your room at once. But he couldn't have done it. I know he didn't do it. Go back to your room, Chris, and don't say a word about this. Hello. Hotel claremont? Miss Neville, please. Well, keep on ringing, please. Hello. Bobby? Listen, darling. Everything went haywire tonight, and I can't talk to you now, but I'll see you early tomorrow. Ah. Good-bye. What did he say? Did he get the Shakespeare? He couldn't talk. I don't think he got it. He lost $50,000 gambling in my place, and if he thinks for one minute... The boy's scared stiff. Sloane was in the house. Maybe that's why he couldn't get it. Maybe. If Sloane gets to be a nuisance, we'll take care of him, too. We can't do any more about it tonight. Can't we? We've got to, Bobby. If we don't get it tonight, we'll never get it. This is Mr. Sergeant's car, sir, but I'm sure he won't mind. Well, I'll try and bring it back all in one piece. Yes, sir. Miss Neville, please. Oh, miss Neville didn't come in till quite late. I don't know if she'll want to be... I think she'll see me, all right. You tell her it's Mr. Torrent. Mr. Gerald Torrent. Oh, yes, Mr. Torrent. Miss Neville, Mr. Torrent is down in the lobby. You can go right up, Mr. Torrent. Number 741. Thank you. Come in, Gerry. Good morning, madam. I represent the union security mutual life insurance company. Are you provided for in your old age? Huh. However, we won't have to worry about that for quite a while yet, will we? And what do you want? Don't call for help until you hear my story. Gerald sent me. In a way, that is. Thank you. Your confidence is not misplaced. Tell your story and tell it fast. My name is Sloane. Yes. I can see that Gerald has mentioned my name. We're great friends. Last night Gerald and i... What do you want with me? Is Gerald in any trouble? He might be. And that goes for you, too. The police might be interested in anybody who was at the Torrent estate last night. I don't know what you're talking about. How did you happen to come here? I've got a divining rod. Did Gerald send you? Gerald isn't very bright. We had a little rumpus last night, and he telephoned you. Just happened that I was outside his door. Well, as long as you and Gerald are friends. I did visit Gerald last night. You know how it is. The family wouldn't approve of me, I guess. So we generally meet away from the house somewhere. Aw. Well, how romantic. In your wanderings down lovers' Lane, you didn't see a valuable Shakespeare manuscript, did you? But I don't understand. What is all this about? Look here, miss Neville. I didn't come here covered with badges and warrants. You can tell me the truth about your visit. How do I know you're on the level? My honest face. Why not give our service a trial? Who is it? Police. Well, you double-crossing... Honest. I had nothing to do with the police coming here. I'm surprised. Look at me. What's the idea? Ok, sister. Up and out. You're under arrest. Both of you. Officer, I never saw this man before. He forced his... Climb out of them feathers, sister. Well, all right, but get out of here and let me get dressed. All right, brother. Get going. All right, what's the idea? What's the charge? Well, there ain't no charge yet, but chances are it will be murder. Murder? Murder of Nicholas Torrent and the theft of a Shakespeare manuscript. Torrent, murdered? Surprised, ain't ya? Well, mister, it happened around the time you grabbed Phil Sergeant's car and ran out. Oh. What about the gun, Jackson? The fingerprints are being taken, inspector. Is there anything else you haven't told me? No, that's all. Do you want to see miss Torrent now? Yes, and get the others together in the living room. Right. Sit down, miss Torrent. I want to express my sympathy, miss Torrent, and give you my promise that whoever was responsible for the death of your father will be caught and punished. You want to help me do that, don't you? Of course, inspector. Good. You found the body, I believe. What did you do? I don't remember. I... I came in the room, screamed, and... Somebody came in and took me out. I... i don't know. Did you touch anything in here? No. You sure of that? Yes. I didn't touch anything. Now, you must think hard. An open fountain pen was found in your father's hand, as though he'd been writing something. You didn't happen to find a piece of paper or perhaps a check? Anything he might have been writing? No. No. Did your father have any enemies that might want to harm him? No. Had he any recent quarrels with friends or members of the family? No. All right. That'll be all for now, miss Torrent. Yes, Jackson? They're all in there except Sloane and Wilkes the librarian and Mrs. Torrent, who's sick. Hendricks phoned that he's bringing in Sloane. I tried to get a line on Wilkes, but he disappeared. Nobody knows anything about him. Well, keep the railroad stations, docks, and airports covered for Wilkes. And let me know the minute the doctor will let me question Mrs. Torrent. Yes, sir. You're not going to stall me any longer, Gerald. It's too important. Don't you see that the police will link the missing books with your father's death? They'll suspect me, you... both of us. I know. We've got to work out some kind of a story, something that we can tell... You've got to return those books. Nothing else. You've got to get them back. I can't get them back, you fool, I sold them. You sold them? Well, what are we going to do? It's not just the books. They'll be questioning me about the murder. Tell the police that Wilkes took them. That will let us both out. I can't. I made him enter it at the binder's. All right, then tell them you gave them to Wilkes to take to the binder's, and I'll swear I saw you give them to him. Then they'll arrest Wilkes... An... An innocent man. I couldn't do that. Well, you're innocent, too. Any news of my husband? He's on his way. And when he comes, he'll make you eat all those dark suspicions. I'm sure he just went out on some perfectly innocent errand, such as mailing a letter or something like that. Won't you please take these things off me? I'll take 'em off when I get good and ready. But my wife is apt to be down here in a minute, and why don't you just hang me without an investigation? Hello. Hello, darling. What was it, a bet? Oh, I beg your pardon. Miss Neville, Mrs. Sloane. How do you do? Fine. Miss Neville is an old friend of Gerald's. We just happened to meet and, uh... Don't yank so, sugar. You're hurting me. Where did you find, um... Him? Uh-huh. In her room. Now, remember, don't either of you try to leave this house. You... you... Worm. Don't flatter yourself. To think you'd... Darling, now is the time I need your comfort, your loving sympathy. I am in trouble. I have been arrested. I wouldn't care if they shot you at sunrise. I wouldn't care if they burned you at the stake. But, darling, I went to see that woman on business. Sure you did, sugar. But she thought I was somebody else. I wish I were. It's positively uncanny. Every time you turn detective, there's always a woman in the crime for you to chase. Well, I guess I'm just that kind of a detective. It's a fine thing. They trapped you right in that hussy's room, in a nightgown. "In a nightgown." I had the same suit on. Not you, dummy, the girl... miss... Whatever her name is. Oh. I, uh... I didn't really notice what she had on. Didn't you, really? Well... I wouldn't mind your following a clue, but did you have to go to her room? A detective must follow wherever his duty leads him. Well, if you swear it was in the line of duty, I, uh... I guess I forgive you. Then I'm in good again, eh? Mm-hmm. How good? Go away. Come back later. Nobody home. It's me, Mr. Sloane... Chris. I've got to see you. Oh. Coming. Mr. Sloane, you're a friend of Phil's. You've got to help me. Of course I will. What's wrong? The police don't know about Gerald yet. You mustn't tell them. Oh, you mean about his gambling, being in need of money. No, no, no. The fight he had last night with father before... Before he... Oh. Your father thought Gerald tried to steal the Shakespeare last night, didn't he? Yes. But Gerald didn't do it. I know he didn't do it. How do you know? He wouldn't do a thing like that. Oh, yes. I see what you mean. Now, look here, I'll do everything I can to help you, but you've got to help me. Oh, I will. I'll do anything. Good. In the first place, we mustn't be seen like this, in conference, by the police. Now, I'll do all I can to protect your brother, but you run along now. I'll talk to you later. You get some rest, dear. My husband may not look very bright, but he's really very good at this sort of thing. He'll fix everything. That's mighty pretty. How am I going to fix everything? But do you think he involved, and Phil, too? I don't know. What a spot for that girl... Her father murdered, and her brother and her sweetheart probably all mixed up in it. Well, anyway, that's about all the trouble one girl can have. Ok, Sloane, inspector's ready for you now. Till Sergeant comes up here, keep him here, will you? Hello, inspector. Would you mind telling me why you sent your bloodhounds after me? Not at all. Because you left this house just about the time Nicholas Torrent was killed and a valuable manuscript was stolen. Yeah, I'll settle for 50% of that. The manuscript was worthless. It was a forgery. What? It's gospel truth. You get Wilkes down here, and I'll prove it to you. You certainly picked the right man to blame it on. Wilkes has disappeared. What do you know about that? Wilkes disappeared? I don't know anything about his disappearance, but I do know that his name wasn't Wilkes. And if you'll check his fingerprints, you'll find he's been in prison. The charge was forgery of some rare documents, I believe. Say, how do I know you're not just trying to lie yourself out of a jam? This is yours, I think. Your fingerprints are on it. Oh, yes. That's the gun I borrowed from Gerald Torrent. After Charlton was slugged, I figured a shooting iron might come in handy. Yes, it did, for the murderer. Oh, now I see why you're so anxious to talk to me, inspector. I left that gun on the table between the 2 beds in my bedroom. I don't know who took it, and I don't know who killed Torrent with it. Why, of course you don't. Now, why don't we all work together and go after Wilkes? That's your case right there. Yeah, maybe. But before I do too much worrying about Wilkes, I've got some pretty suspicious people right under this roof. Gerald Torrent isn't on the up and up, not by any means, and his sister seems to be holding back something, too. Well, you can wreck a few lives that way, inspector, and cause the Torrent family a lot more grief, but you're not going to solve the case. Why don't you try it my way until you know where we stand? I think I've got an angle that will help you. Mm-hmm? The genuine manuscript may have been stolen and sold a long time ago, and the forgery substituted at that time to keep Torrent happy. Then we've got to find out who bought it. And that'll be easy, providing the papers go on printing that the real Shakespeare was stolen here last night. How is that again? Look here... if the collector who bought the genuine manuscript reads that a fake has been stolen, we'll never hear a peep out of him. But if he thinks he bought a fake, he'll squawk. Like an eagle. Well, I hope you know what you're talking about. I do, and I know book collectors. And no one... absolutely no one... Must find out that we've discovered a forgery. Why don't you do as he says and go after Wilkes? Ok, I'll check on what you say about Wilkes right away. Yes, Hendricks? Here's the dope on that license number. Car is registered in the name of Lionel c. Delaney. Uh, beg your pardon, sir. It's butch Delaney... one of Lucky Nolan's boys. That's funny. Lucky Nolan's a big-time gambler, and that car was parked out here on the road last night. Yes, well, I've heard of Nolan. If you're not going to electrocute me on the spot, I think I'll run along now. Ok, but don't get the idea you're in business for yourself. If you get any information, I want it. You'll get it. Hello, Phil. Hello, Joel. Phil, you're in some kind of a jam. Why don't you tell me about it? You know I'd be on your side. I don't know what you're talking about. I just came out... To find out how much I knew. Come on, now. What about those books? What happened to them? I've nothing to tell. Don't you realize what a spot you'll be in if the police tie you into this thing? There's been a murder committed here. We're looking for Phil Sergeant. Oh, there you are. What was the name of the bindery you said you took those books to, Phil? Vincente brothers. Now, what's the use of beating around the bush, Hilliard? All right, young fellow, spill it. What happened to those books you stole, and where's your partner... Wilkes? I've nothing to say, and I don't know anything about Wilkes. Uh-huh. When did Torrent find out you were stealing books? Come on, Phil, speak up. Tell him the truth. Keep out of this. He'll talk. Don't be a smug, heroic little idiot! They're pinning a murder on you! Yes, and it fits him fine. Torrent caught Sergeant and Wilkes stealing his books, so they had to kill him. All right, Sergeant, you're under arrest on suspicion of murder. Phil! Darling, what's happened? No, no, it's perfectly all right. There's been a slight mix-up about the inventory in the library, and Phil has to go downtown to straighten it out. That's right. He may be gone quite a while. Come on. Now, don't let it upset you. I'm sure everything will be all right. There goes the only protege I ever had. I just can't believe it. Phil doesn't seem the type to do a thing like that. Certainly not. He's protecting somebody... Gerald, most likely. Ooh, that rotter. It's true enough, and after all, he's Christina's brother. Phil's afraid the police might find out too much about Gerald. Men do the silliest things. If you'd only seen the prowler that came into this room and took that gun off the table. After all, darling, you ought to be a little bit more curious about people who come into your bedroom. Oh, I've gotten so used to excitement, I could go right on sleeping if a cavalry regiment rode into the room. Well, you shouldn't have taken a room right on the Lincoln highway. Oh, hello, Mr. Charlton. Come in. I'm not intruding, I hope. Oh, it's quite all right. Everybody does it. Not at all. Come in. No, please, Mrs. Sloane. Don't let me put you out. Ah. Oh, I'm putting her out myself. Anyway, she's got to go and see about the car, haven't you, dear? I guess so. Heh heh. What car? Any car. Oh, ok. I've been talking to the police. They seem to think that Wilkes and the Sergeant boy are at the bottom of this. For a while this morning, they suspected me, so there you are. Last night, Torrent told me how Wilkes flared up at you in the library. Oh, he showed a wide maniacal streak, all right, and he's absent without leave. That's 50% of the case right there. Can we retain you to investigate that phase, Mr. Sloane? "We"? The Torrent family. Oh. No fee's been mentioned, but you can make up what you might have earned by the sale of the manuscript. You mean you'd want me to concentrate on Wilkes and kind of keep Gerald Torrent out of this? You're a very understanding man, Mr. Sloane. I'm sorry, Mr. Charlton. I couldn't promise you anything like that. You see, my interest in this case is Phil Sergeant. I'm working for him. I've seen about the car. What car? I was just going, Mrs. Sloane. Thank you. I'm sorry you're not available. Nice fella. Available for what? Yes, I took it for granted you were listening at the keyhole. Me, do a thing like that? Anyway... It was stuffed up. Let's step out tonight. Mmm? Maybe have a whirl on the wheel of fortune. Oh. Have you ever been to Nolan's? No. What is it? It's a high-class gambling house. Mmm. Exclusive, expensive, and right now, very interesting. Looks terribly private. Can we get in? It is terribly private, but I got a card through some influential friends. Mmm. That's a mighty interesting arrangement. They have to make it look as if it's hard to get in. May be hard to get out, in case you're thinking of starting something. Who, me? He just came in, Mr. Nolan. I don't want Sloane to leave until I've had a talk with him, but no rough stuff. That's all. I had a feeling Sloane was interested in this place. It's a good thing you told me. Don't make the mistake of thinking he's a fool, even if he chatters a lot and clowns around. It wasn't very smart of him to come here, and I'm going to demonstrate that to Mr. Sloane. You can beat it now. Don't you order me around like one of your stooges. I'm so sorry, duchess. May I have the pleasure of your absence? Beat it, now. Number 34, red. Bingo. That's my number. Do they play for keeps here? I wouldn't be surprised. Right now, I think they'd like to keep me. You better cash in and beat it. Oh. For you. Thank you. Good night. You go outside and wait for me in the car. Number 21. If I don't come out in half an hour... Call the inspector. All right, darling. You must leave your stake on, madame. A thousand on the black. A thousand on the black. A thousand? No, madame, that is not yours. Ho-hum. That is not your money, madame. Oh, I beg your pardon. That's all right, lady. I'll just show you to your car. But my wrap. I want to get my wrap. It's right down here. Well... Where can I cash these chips? Mr. Nolan's office. Over there. Well, I'm in kind of a hurry. Isn't there a cashier around? No, I can see that there isn't. Ok, sir. No more bets, please. No more bets. Come in. Oh, good evening, Mr. Sloane. Good evening. I, uh... I just dropped in to cash a few chips. My. Wow. It's an interesting collection. I'm in the book business... Heh... as if you didn't know. I see I won't have to waste much time with you, Mr. Sloane. No, no, you just go ahead and cash the chips, and I'll run along. You have exactly $5,000 worth. That stack adds up to $100. Isn't there a typographical error there? Oh, I adjust the value of the chips to suit myself. So, of course, I'll expect you to do something for me. Move out of the Torrent home. Mind your own business. I didn't know you were interested in that case, Mr. Nolan. Oh, it's merely a matter of friendship. I want your promise that you'll drop it. And if I don't? You might meet with an accident. Serious? Now I'll tell your fortune: There is a tall, dark man going to take a great interest in you. I don't like being threatened. Did you really think I'd let Mrs. Sloane leave so she could telephone the police from outside? Oh, she's quite safe. She's with my boys. Yeah? Is Mrs. Sloane quite comfortable, Reilly? A lot more comfortable than you'd be if I ever lay my hands on you. Think it over, Mr. Sloane. Well, it looks as if you're in the driver's seat, Mr. Nolan. Believe me, I am. Now I'll tell you what you're going to do. You call up and instruct those men to let my wife go. She's to call me from outside. I hate to sound melodramatic, Mr. Nolan, but to save my wife any discomfort, I would cheerfully kill a dozen guys like you. And when that didn't work, they lit matches to my feet. And then they tried the Chinese water torture. You know, Garda, you haven't visited your mother in a long time. It ought to be wonderful up in Vermont now: Spring, the flowers coming up, good old home cooking. Mmm, make mine the same. When do we go? Well, I couldn't leave right now, but there's nothing that would stop you. No? No. Chances are, I could follow you in a day or so anyway. Sure, feet first. Why, what do you mean? Aw, now, Joel, you can't fool your old wife. You are scared. Yeah, you're exactly 100% right. They're going to try and get at me through you. Darling, I wish you'd go. Mm-mm. This case needs a woman's touch, and so do you. That's them, all right. Let 'er go. Boy, he's going places. He must be drunk. Garda. Garda! Garda, where are you? Joel, over here. Garda... Are you all right? This must be heaven. I'll go flag a car, and we'll get a lift. Oh, and leave all this swell hay? Do you want some fried onions on that? How does it look? It looks all right. Can you see through it? Mm-hmm. Feels much better. Are you sure this is from a contented cow? That cow used to run around picking flowers all day long and singing at the top of its voice. Do you suppose we could send it downstairs after my eye is better and get it cooked? Are you hungry? I think so. If I had something to eat, I could make sure. Ho-hum. Another day. Hmm. Did you say "ho-hum"? After Nolan missed us by an eyelash? Ah, that was just one of his boyish pranks. Ah, that's not all. You're worried and trying not to show it, and I'm scared and don't care who knows it. Joel, what's behind all this gunplay and stealing and murder? I don't know, but I got kind of an idea stirring around inside of me. I wish I could locate Wilkes. Oh... Night. Don't worry about it. Darling? You don't happen to have an old crust of bread or a can of beans on you, do you? Go to sleep. Who is it? It's me... Oates. Oh, go away. You got the wrong number. I heard noise in the hall, and I was frightened so i... Garda? Garda! She's not here. Garda? Garda! Where are you? Garda? Don't move, anybody. Stay where you are. Darling, are you all right? - Something's screwy here. - What have you got there? I... i didn't mean anything. I mean, I have... Let's have a look at what you're hiding. Why, honestly, i... Come on, come on. It's a chicken leg. I... i was hungry. Well, go to your rooms, everybody, and stay there. Joel. Joel. Why, Joel, it's Mr. Wilkes. He's dead. And so's your perfectly swell theory. It was your idea. You're the guy who's had me scouring 7 states for Wilkes. "Wilkes is this," and "Wilkes is that." Now I've got Wilkes. What in the name of thunder am I going to do with him? Nobody calls for him in 30 days, he's yours. All I did was give you his record. You figured out the rest for yourself. You know more than you've told me, and don't think I don't know that much. I'm going to make it my business... Inspector, do you know what I honestly think... Oh! "Oh!" Darling, what's the matter? Are you in the doghouse again? I'm man's best friend, all right. I'm protecting so many people in this case, I'll probably end up in the cooler myself. Oh, well, tomorrow's another day. Not another one like this one, I hope. Let's get some sleep. I got to get up early and get into town. Ah, ah, ah. Now, you're not coming home handcuffed to that miss Neville again, are you? Who, me? I don't mind if you sit there and ask questions for the rest of the day, but suppose your wife learns you've been here with me? Aw, she wouldn't mind. She hasn't got that much jealousy in her makeup. Oh, hasn't she? No. Anyway, I'm doing my good turn for the day. I'm trying to save you from what happened to Torrent and Wilkes. I think you ought to stop drinking. Look, you were out at Torrent's the night that Charlton was knocked out, weren't you? Of course I was. I told you why. I'm not interested in "why." I want to know what you saw. Who knocked Torrent out and left him in front of the safe? Wouldn't you like a nice ice bag on your head? All right. With that cute, girlish little way you're just holding out on me, I won't be able to give you a gold star on your report card this month. Let me fill your glass, and don't get so worked up. No, 2 lumps. Ok. You won't talk, that's your funeral. I may not be so far wrong at that. I like you, even if you are crazy. It's a shame you are so busy with crimes, or we could have a little party sometime. Yeah... You and I and Lucky Nolan. Ha ha. Don't you trust me? No. Then I'll give you something to remember me by. Hey. Be sure and give my regards to your wife. Oh... You certainly did your best to sell him a bill of goods, didn't you? Well, your method wasn't exactly a howling success. No, I guess it wasn't. What are we supposed to do now, Lucky... Just wait around for Mr. Sloane to throw us all into jail? I've got to be at Torrent's this afternoon. The police sent for me. I may get a chance to have a quiet little chat with Mr. Sloane. Whew. Hello, dear. Where were you? Downtown. I thought it'd be nice if I got Phil Sergeant out of jail. And did you? Well, with my influence, it was a cinch. I spoke to the authorities, and the prison portals opened wide. Hey, shift gears. You're in reverse. Oh. Heh heh. You've been gone all morning. Don't you want to kiss me? Uh, I... Got kind of a cold. Oh, you poor darling. Here, get right out of those clothes... No, no, no. I'm perfectly all right. I, uh... better now. I wish you could have heard me handle those fellas down at police headquarters. I said to the judge, "either you let my friend Phil Sergeant go, or I'll have you..." did you have to post bail? Well, I had to sign a few papers, but just a formality. What kind of papers? In order to... Pledging the business or what's left of it. But it will only be for 3 or 4 days. Ah. I don't mind, darling. It was really sweet of you to... Oh, you know, for a moment, I thought perhaps the path of duty led you to miss Neville's boudoir. What a notion. Ah, isn't that silly? To think you'd go and see that hussy. Whew! How she reeks of that 10-cent store perfume, like ladies' night in a turkish bath. Yes, exactly. If there's anything I cannot stand, it's the odor of cheap perfume. Absolutely sickens me. Well, darling, will you forgive me for suspecting you? Why, of course I would. Don't mention it. Ah. You unspeakable toad. Now, don't do anything rash. I can explain it to you. I had to put perfume on. I was crossing a field and I... I stepped on a skunk. You took the word right out of my mouth. Inspector wants you right away, Sloane. Coming. Good morning, men. Ahem. Any old clues for sale today? I've got a squad of men searching the house from top to bottom for the Shakespeare and... Whether it's a fake or genuine, I've got to find that manuscript. Oh, well, you can search my room and you can search me. Not my wife, though. After all, you got to draw the line at some things. Uh... Yes? Yes, this is inspector Forbes. Huh? What's that?! You did what? What's up? There's a guy on the phone, says he bought the Torrent Shakespeare a year ago. Who is it? Stockton. Victor Stockton. Give it to me. I know him. Here, I'll talk to him. Hello? Hello? Oh, yes, Sloane. Yes, yes, I remember you. Now what is all this? Now, look here, Sloane, I don't care if I can solve 40 murders. I'm not going to say a word until I find out where I stand. Oh, I know you're not accusing me, but I can't afford to be the laughingstock of the country. I'm in the investment business. Suppose it gets out that I spent a fortune on a worthless manuscript. I can't afford that kind of publicity, Sloane, and I won't... Aw, well, don't believe anything you read in the papers. Look, Mr. Stockton, I know you've got the genuine Shakespeare. No, it's no trick. I tell you what you do: You bring it out here, and I'll prove it to you. Yes, I'll come right over, and I'll bring the manuscript with me. Yes. Yes, right away. Yes, I know it's important. Well, boys, we haven't a worry in the world. Oh, we're in the homestretch now. All we have to do is find out who sold him the real Shakespeare a year ago and we have the solution to 2 murders. Yeah, and we'll soon know. By the way, inspector, I hope you don't mind, but I got Phil Sergeant out of your jail. I don't care if you empty my jail, just so we find out who sold Stockton that genuine Shakespeare. Heh heh! Oh. You see that? Even the whole police department couldn't keep me away from you. Oh, Phil, I knew you were protecting Gerald. You did that for me, and I feel so ashamed because I let you face arrest and disgrace. None of that matters now. I've been foolish about some things, that's all. Phil... Do you think Gerald did it? Darling, you mustn't even think such things. But did he? It would be unbearable to think that he did. What does Mr. Sloane think? Mr. Sloane thinks this is one of the prettiest pictures he has ever seen. Miss Torrent, would you mind if I asked you a question? Why do you think your brother killed your father? I'm sorry, but someone was bound to ask you that sooner or later, you know. Please, Mr. Sloane... We're going to have some information soon that'll clear up this case, and you may do your brother a lot of harm by hiding anything from me now. Mr. Sloane, have they found out anything about Gerald? No, but if they do, I want to be in a position to help him. Now, tell me, what have you been withholding from the police? I found a letter on the desk in the library. I didn't tell the police because it was from my father to his lawyers, instructing them to cut Gerald out of his will. It was unfinished and i... What did you do with it? I hid it in my room. Let's get it. Mr. Stockton, will you wait in the library? Thank you. Here it is. Shh. It's been forced open. The letter isn't here. Well, we'll probably see it at the trial. Yeah, you're darn tootin' you'll see it at the trial. What's more, you'll see it soon. I kind of thought you were holding out on me, Sloane. I'm going to make it my business to see that you don't get a nickel out of this case. Oh, come on now. Keep your shirt on. What right have you got to break open miss Torrent's personal property? "What right"? What right have I got? She was obstructing justice, that's all... concealing evidence, and hiding from the police her brother's motive for the murder of her fath... Well, what are you snooping around about? I, sir? Yes, you. What do you want? Mr. Stockton has arrived, sir. He's waiting for you in the li... Well, who is Stockton? Right now, he's the long arm of destiny. Mr. Stockton! Open up in there! Mr. Stockton, open the door! Say, Hilliard, Hendricks, give me a hand here. We'll have to bust it in. Come on. Your witness, inspector. Now, I know where most of you were when Stockton arrived, so that narrows it down. Mr. Torrent, did you see Stockton arrive? No. No? Well, suppose you tell us where you were... Well? Mr. Nolan asks if you'll see him now. How long has Nolan been here? Well, bring him in. Did you check with Stockton's driver? Stockton brought the Shakespeare, all right. We've got 6 men checking through the house and grounds for it now. Hello, inspector. How long have you been here, Nolan? About 20 minutes. The front door was open, there was no one in the hall, so I walked back toward the rear of the house. The Butler asked me to wait. Oh, just strolling around down here, eh? I know how to loosen you up, Nolan. I'll get back to you in a few minutes. Sit down. Now, Torrent, where did you say you were when Stockton arrived? I, uh, was out on the terrace. Anybody with you? Gerald and I were on the terrace together. We were discussing some business. Oh. What kind of business? Uh, taxes. Exactly. All right, Nolan, that leaves you. You know, it's bad enough for a man with your reputation just to be in the same house with a murder. Let's hear your story, quick. Sure, no one's going to frame me into a murder charge. Gerald Torrent got me into this. He owed me a lot of money and naturally, I was pressing him for it. Then he told me that he and Sergeant had lifted some books here and that now they could get the Shakespeare manuscript. That's a lie. He ma me do it... Well, that's about all. I wanted my money, and I didn't care if he stole Grant's tomb to get it. He told me it would be absolutely safe, that Sergeant would cover it up. Just an innocent bystander, eh? You don't believe that, do you, inspector? I certainly do. I... yes, Jackson? Inspector, we've located the Shakespeare manuscript. It was hidden in Gerald Torrent's room. Ok. Well, that cinches it. Hendricks, Mike, you take Sergeant and Torrent downtown and book them. The charge is grand larceny and suspicion of murder. Here it is, inspector. Ha ha! That's it. You know, Sloane, for all the help you've been to us, you might just as well have been in timbuktu. Wait a minute, Forbes. You know there were 2 manuscripts: The one that I brought and the real one that came with Stockton. Yeah, which one is this? I don't know. Well, I guess I'll run along back to timbuktu. Any time you boys want to call... Now, wait a minute, Sloane. Now, you can't walk out on us now. Which manuscript is that? Inspector, you put a little glue on this and you'll have some nice flypaper. This is a forgery. It's the one I saw the first night I came here. Now, you boys listen to me. This thing has been put in Gerald's room to frame him. It's a one-way ticket to the electric chair. You don't think he'd be dumb enough to put it right in his own room, do you? I've got a hunch it may lead us right to the genuine manuscript and the murderer... Provided that you don't tell a soul that this is a fake and give me 24 hours. Ok, Sloane. Mr. Oates, did Joel tell you where he was going? Joel who? Oh, Joel. No, he didn't tell me. Now, don't let's cross any Bridges till we... till we... You have to figure that one out for yourself. It's nearly 3 hours since he left. Surely he should be back by now. Back where? Oh, yes. That is, I guess so. But I'm worried. He said he'd be home in an hour. Just so that he gets home in time to help me close the deal with Charlton tomorrow. Mr. Oates, don't you understand Garda? Joel may be hurt. He may be in trouble. And all you do is sit there, babbling about your chance to buy a manuscript. You must have ink in your veins. Ink? Why, yes. I believe I have a fountain pen right here. Mrs. Sloane? Yes. I'm from headquarters. Your husband had a little accident and he... Where is he? What happened? It's not serious. I can take you right to him. I'll be right with you. I don't know who you are, my friend, but I know we can't make the payment. Why, Joel! What's the matter, darling? Are you all right? This man told me that you were in an accident. He was taking me to see you. Uh, it was a mistake, buddy. I guess I'll be going now. You run along, dear. I just want to talk to our good samaritan. Is something the matter? Not anymore. There must be something wrong with the radiator. Oh, Joel, what did you do with him? Well, he may be a little difficult to recognize, but I sent him back to his boss... Nolan. Nolan? Yes. He's afraid I might try and interfere with his plans, so he's trying to get at me through you. But why should he? After all, Phillip and Gerald... He knows perfectly well that this case isn't solved by that. I think I'll have to go and have a little talk with Mr. Nolan. You will not. Darling, I don't want to play Daniel to his lions, but I can't have him snatching my wives right from under my nose. Well, then, we'll go to the police. After all, we pay tax... Even if the police were hanging from the chandelier, I wouldn't feel that either of us was safe. You know I don't look well in black. But, darling, this case is coming to a boiling point. Nolan is desperate and absolutely ruthless. But if you go down there, you'll be just as crazy as he is ruthless. Look here, you've had one visitor tonight. You don't want another one, do you? All right. Darling, you'll be careful? And how. Mr. Oates, you take care of Garda. Watch her. Don't let her out of your sight. Watch? Sure. Leave her to me. Oh, Joel! Hurry back, all in one piece. I'll be just as safe as if I was in my own bed. Now, you heard what Joel said, young lady. And I don't intend to let you out of my sight for any reason. I don't intend to give you a bit of trouble, Mr. Oates, so you can rest easy. That's fine. You want to play ventriloquist? Huh? Skip it, Charlie. I don't see why we should sit at home all evening while Joel is gallivanting around. After all, it's a free country. Now, you stay right here. Oh, oatsey, all I want is a bit of innocent fun. Well, uh... Provided you stay with me. Mm-hmm. Now where do you want to go? I don't know. Uh... How about Nolan's? Nolan's? All right. Haven't you made a mistake, Lucky? Where's the rest of the money? Oh, I was just going to tell you, I didn't get all the money yet. But when I do, you'll get yours. That's a lie. I'm not just another sucker like Gerald, and you're not going to hold out on me. Who said anything about holding out? I gave you an even break there. You never gave anybody an even break. Yes? All right. Now, I don't want you hanging around here tonight. Sloane has just come in. I'm going to settle with him. That's all right with me, but first, start counting it out. I told you, that's all there is, sweetheart. And you think I'm going to let you get away with it? Now, Bobby, I don't want to have to pound some common sense into you. Take the money I gave you and beat it. Suppose I turn the heat on myself? Suppose I go to the m... Get out. No more bets. Permit me, madam, with these crude ingredients, to mix you a drink. Get out of here. This drink, invented by me, is called scotch and soda. Be smart. Go home. You seem bitter tonight, not your usual cheerful self. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. I think I know what you're drinking to forget. Did you get the short end of a payoff, by any chance? Oh, it's all right with me if you want to sit back and take it. How'd you know about that? I'm the alert, wide-awake type. Why don't you come along with me? We'll go someplace where we can talk. I thought I told you to get out. I was just going. Yes, with him. Go to my office. I want to talk to you. I've already arranged to see miss Neville home. Oh, you have? That's very gallant of you. 51, red. You have a peculiar genius for mixing in my affairs. You have some peculiar affairs. I'm going to show you the unpleasant side of snooping, Mr. Sloane. Sorry, lady, but you can't come in without a membership card. Now, see here, my man! Go on home, pop. You can't get in without a membership card. That's no way to talk to a man who's old enough to be your father. Now, wait just a moment. I told you that you can't get in without a membership card. Don't be so... Joel! Run! Why, Mrs. Sloane, fancy meeting you here. Well, how are you coming with the inventory? Are you all in one piece? Yeah, I think so. How many fingers did I have when I went to Nolan's? Oh, 30 or 40, but only half a brain. I came within an eyelash of solving this case tonight. I got Bobby Neville talking, and she almost told me everything she knew. Oh, I'll bet that would be interesting. I, uh... I ordered a pair of bulletproof pants, and when they come, I will... Well, what are you waiting for? You answer it. You're up. It's not for me, and you're up. Hello? Who? Miss Neville? Send her up. Hey, now, wait a minute... Now, darling, you don't understand. This is what I've been waiting for. I'm sure of that. This girl has probably broken with Nolan. I'm going to ask her 2 questions and solve the whole case. You wait here. Oh, all right, but don't hang anything over the keyhole. Hello. Nolan? Heh heh. Come in. I, uh, had to leave Nolan's in kind of a hurry tonight, so I didn't get an opportunity to thank you. You did turn out those lights, didn't you? Yes. Thank you. I need your help. Nolan cheated me out of the money we got, and I want to get even. I knew it. Who paid it? Charlton, wasn't it? Yes. All right. Now let's hear the rest of the story. I was to get half of the $50,000 Gerald lost to Nolan, and tonight... Wait a minute. I'm interested in Charlton and the money that he paid. I'm getting to that. Listen, will you? What did you see Charlton do that night in the library? Nothing. What? You mean to say that you didn't see him frame an attack on himself? Certainly not. I didn't even look in the window. And you weren't blackmailing Charlton? No. The money he paid Nolan was to settle Gerald's debt. The Torrent family raised it, I guess, because they were afraid of Nolan. Who's in there? Oh, that's my wife. She's delirious. Afraid I can't help you, Bobby. What? After queering me with Nolan? I know, and I'm sorry about it. I had this whole thing solved with one of those harebrained theories of mine. I should have known better. So this is "the smart Sloane," the wizard. You were going to fix everything, you four-flushing windbag! Nice-looking outfit. Who's been paying for your clothes lately? Nobody. It goes back in the morning. Hello, Garda. Hello, Joel. Hello. I just saw your friend Oates leaving, as we've had some very bad news. Yes, we know. I'm afraid I've got some very bad news for you, too. Charlton is on his way up here to sell the phony manuscript. When he finds out it's a fake, he'll file a claim with you for $500,000 right away. Thanks. That's very nice of you. We've had a crew of men ransacking the Torrent place from top to bottom, and still have been unable to find the genuine manuscript that Stockton brought with him. Well, I'm going downstairs and get a paper. What for? Oh, just to see if any of our friends have been murdered this morning. How's Gerald standing up? Well, he has the jitters, naturally. That family of his have hired a bang-up lawyer, fortunately. Heh! And that swell sister of his would be an asset to anybody. Mmm. Did you really put up bail for her boyfriend? He didn't steal anything. He was just protecting Gerald. Charlton. - Mr. Sloane. - Good morning, sir. Hello, Mr. Hilliard. I suppose Mr. Hilliard's here to transfer the insurance. Well, you see, I am ready for business, too. This sale will help the torrents immensely. The expenses of a trial, you know, are quite heavy and, uh... Why, where's Mr. Oates? He went out. Well, I suppose you've the power to act for him in this purchase. May we conclude the sale, Mr. Sloane? Mr. Oates went out to return his certified check to his bank. There will be no sale, Mr. Charlton. If your client changed his mind, I should have been notified. My client hasn't changed his mind. He's just as anxious as ever to purchase the Shakespeare manuscript. However, the one you have there is a fake. What? Unfortunately, sir, there can't be any doubt about it. I don't understand. You must be mistaken. What he says is the truth, Mr. Charlton. The manuscript that you have is a forgery. I know it's a shock to you, but the Torrent family won't lose anything by it. The insurance companies will make up the loss. Yes, of course. Just make your claim and let me have that one. Well, I'd like, first of all, to consult Mrs. Torrent. Then, and, uh... I have the papers right here. I think later on would be better, Mr. Hilliard. Suit yourself. I only wanted to save time, that's all. Good day, gentlemen. Before you go, Mr. Charlton, I wish you'd let me show you how to detect the forgery in that copy. That's not at all necessary. You're an expert in these matters. Your word is sufficient. But Mrs. Torrent might like an explanation. I'd like to show you how your copy differs from the original. I am sure Mrs. Torrent's opinion would coincide with yours, Mr. Sloane. Good day, gentlemen. But it might expedite matters in your claim against the insurance company if you would only let... That's none of your business! Are you quite sure, Mr. Charlton? What's wrong? Mr. Charlton's reluctance to let us see the manuscript he has clutched to his bosom is very interesting, Dave. That might be the genuine manuscript he's cradling in his arms. He may have gotten it the night he killed Stockton. Look at his face. Give me that! Look out. He's got a gun. So you did detect the forgery. I wish I'd known that. And I wish I'd known Bobby Neville played that little drama at my house last night because you bribed her to throw me off your trail. It was you who sold the genuine Shakespeare to Stockton a year ago, claiming you were acting for Torrent. The other night, Torrent found it out. You had to kill him. You put Wilkes out of the way because he made the forgery for you, and you shut Stockton's mouth before he could identify you. Turn back, both of you. As long as you were going to conk yourself over the head with a vase, why didn't you pick a nice, heavy brass one and crack your crazy skull? I was careful to select a light and fragile one. I brought you some peanuts, darling. I know it was... Oh... Oh! - Oh. - Garda! Here, take care of this. Oh. Uh, you get away from him, now. Get away from him! Oh! Joel! Oh! Why did you have to pick on me? Why don't you close your eyes when you shoot? I did. Ah, ah, ah, ah! Captioning made possible by Turner entertainment group
