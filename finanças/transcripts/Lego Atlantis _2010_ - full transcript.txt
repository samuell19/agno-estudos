[PIPE WHISTLES OVER PA] Attention, all hands, this is your captain speaking. We are now passing 8000 meters. If you look out your port-side window, you will see darkness. However, if you turn your attention to the starboard side of the craft... ...you can catch a glimpse of total blackness. [LAUGHS] "Total blackness." That never gets old, Ace. Very nice. What is it, Dr. Fisher? Ha, ha. Please, call me Fish. It's an undocumented species. There have been reports of it dating back hundreds of years. But sadly, no one's ever found one. That's because it's a myth. It doesn't exist. We've been on a hundred salvage missions... ...and every time he thinks he's gonna see it. I think it's nice to believe in something. Even if it hasn't been proven. The brilliant physicist Albert Einstein once said: [AS EINSTEIN] "It's not that I'm so smart... ...it's just that I stay with problems longer." He wasn't talking about a fish. Ugh. It applies to everything in life. The only way to fail is to give up. Where's First Mate Spears? [SNORING] Sure, throw a parade in my honor, that would be great. Who wants some? Oh, no, I'm blind. [SCREAMS] I'm sorry, Lance. Did I scare you? Yeah, right. Nothing scares me. In fact-- - On your feet, maggot! - Aye, aye, sir. [LAUGHS] Uh, huh? Okay, yeah, that scares me. - It's the eye patch, isn't it? - It helps. Hey, what happened to my briefing table? Somebody must have turned it into a bed. - Heh. The nerve of some people, right? - Hmm. If you're finished with your beauty sleep... ...I'd like you to meet Professor Samantha Rhodes. Hello, Sam. Please, call me professor. First Mate Lance Spears. Deep-sea diver and expert in anything that goes "boom." Huh? [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] My hair. Heh. [SCOFFS] I know who you are. You're the best of the best, hand-picked for this mission. There's a sea station on the ocean floor built to recover, uh, rare antiquities. A few weeks ago there was an underwater earthquake... - ...and the crew barely escaped. BOTH: Ah! But the station disappeared. Nothing disappears. If it's down here, we'll find it. Well, it might not be that easy. You see, the sea station was built to explore a theory I have. ACE: Hmm. RHODES: Legend tells of an island in the Atlantic that-- Wait a minute. A professor? A slide show? This reminds me of school. I hated school. Quiet, Lance. [RHODES CLEARS THROAT] Legend tells of an island in the Atlantic that contained a great city... ...with riches beyond our imagination. Its walls were made of precious metals... ...its architecture so advanced... ...some believe we still have not matched it today. But volcanic activity on the ocean floor led to a tidal wave. The entire island was swallowed up by the sea... ...never to be seen again. [FISH SOBBING] Uh.... Until now. Behold, the map to Atlantis. [SNORES THEN GRUNTS] That doesn't look like a map. You said this was a salvage mission, not a wild-goose chase. I had to say that, or you never would have agreed to this mission. Nobody ever believes it exists. You're right about that. With all due respect, professor, we're a salvage crew. We salvage things and hope to find a little treasure along the way. [RHODES GROANS] This map could be the key to unlocking the greatest treasure of all time. [ALARM RINGING] Proximity alert. - Ha-ha! RHODES: Watch it. Uh-oh. Something big, 100 meters and closing. Collision course, captain. Brace yourselves. A giant crab. - Maybe it won't see us. - I don't think it needs to see us. I think it senses us. [ALARM BLARING] Lance, give me a grappler astern. Aim for the rim. Aye, aye, sir. [SHIP CREAKING] Whoa! Captain, a wrecked sub. Ah! From the sea station. Sir, it's coming back. Lance, you have the con. I'm going crabbing. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Crab. Jeez, why so crabby? Hmm. I think this is what it was guarding. [GASPS] Huh? Lance, please tell me you fixed the cable. Huh. I knew I forgot something. [ALL SCREAMING] [ALL SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] LANCE: Huh? [SCREAMING STOPS] ACE: Where are we? - Fifteen thousand meters. Impossible. No one's ever traveled that far below the surface. In fact, no map even shows this depth exists. - Huh? - This one does. And if I understand this map correctly... ...there should be one crystal for each side of the pyramid. The first crystal lay at the gate to another world. The volcano was the gate. That leaves three more. Find them and we find Atlantis. We're not actually gonna look for them, are we, sir? Not in this sub. Too much damage. Then, what are we gonna do? ACE: Any good salvage team travels with more than one sub. And we're the best. - Wow! - Whoa! Grab your tool belts, we've got some building to do. [GRUNTS] Oh, beautiful. [GASPS] Good job. RHODES: I've always wanted to build my own sub. [ENGINE STARTS THEN ACE GASPS] [LANCE CHUCKLES] Hmm. Oh, wow. RHODES: Oh. Great job. [LANCE GRUNTS] - For your approval. - Hmm. I approve, I'll take it. Wait a minute, where's mine? - Unh! Whoa! - We need you to be mobile. - You're our best diver. - Ah. You hear that? The best. My sub's bigger. [RHODES GROANS] [ARTIFACT HUMMING] These markings are giving us directions. Let's move out. Hey, I give the orders around here. Let's move out. Oh. Men. [GROWLING] RHODES: Guys, wait, stop. [GASPS] Amazing. If this is Atlantis, I want a refund. [RHODES GROANS] Look here, these markings are the same as on the map. ACE: Who would build this? [SCREECHING] Maybe that squid man holding the pitchfork? It's a trident. Oh, a trident. I was worried there for a second. [ALL SCREECHING] Now we can worry. No, we need to let them know we mean them no harm. We are guests in their home. If you were to have a guest in your home... ...you would want an introduction, right? Not if you look like that. FISH: Hello. We come in peace. BOTH: Huh? We are looking for a crystal... ...so if you could just point the way.... RHODES: "Beware those who enter." Fish, get out of there. [CAMERA CLICKING] [ALL GROWLING] Swim away! [ALL SCREECHING] Oh, no. Huh? Whoa! Of course, a giant squid. Whoa! Hey! I have an idea. Get to the caves. [LANCE YELLING] Woo-hoo! Ha, ha! Yah! Hey! Woo-hoo! [LAUGHS] [ACE LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] Smile. Say "ink." [ARTIFACT HUMMING] Fish, what is that? Oh. Looks like manta rays. But don't worry, they're harmless. [SCREECHING] Harmless? Oh, no. [FISH WHIMPERING] [GRUNTING] [SQUID MEN SCREECHING] Ha, ha! All right. That's odd, they seemed scared. Of course they were scared. Did you see those moves? Yah! What would have scared them like that? Shark! Huh? [SCREAMS] [WHIMPERING] No. [PANTING] You got an extra dive suit in that sub? Oh, not good. [ACE GRUNTS] [SHARK GRUNTING] Fish, get a photo. Ace, look out. Oh. You ruined the picture. Whoa! Go get him, little buddy. Who's that guy? - It didn't work. - Wait for it. [SHARK BURPS] [EXPLOSION THEN SHARK FARTS] Hey, pal, you need to lay off the beans. [SHARK FARTS] [GASPS] Guys, over here. - Three down, one to go. - Ah. Huh? [GRUNTS] [SQUID MAN GROWLS] [GASPS] [FLUSHES] [SIGHS] Hey, there's nothing wrong with your eye. I never said anything was wrong with my eye. I just think eye patches are cool. And I want it back. We have to go after him. If he gets lost out here we'll never find him. Relax. Every sub has a tracking device. [TRACKER BEEPING] [FISH GASPS] Over here. - Huh? - We thought we lost you. What took you so long? [LANCE GASPS] [ACE CHUCKLES] Woo-hoo! Good job, captain. Woo-hoo! Hey, I want an eye patch too. [ALL YELLING] [GASPS] [GASPS] ACE: Hey, what the--? [CREATURES GROWLING] [GASPS] [WHIMPERING] Ah. Hmm. Hey, hey! We don't have weapons to fight them. I've got it. The shark didn't go after me because he didn't see me. Sharks hunt by movement, right? So we run away. How can we run away without moving? [ALL GRUNT] Ah. The final crystal. [GASPS] [SIGHS] I just don't get it. We found all the crystals, Atlantis should be here. I guess it is just a myth. If you say it's here, then we'll find it. I believe in you. You're part of this crew now. Thanks. Guys, the crystals don't provide the key to Atlantis, they are the key. We're still missing one. [ALL GASP] It was right there the whole time. [GROWLING] [GROWLING] You gotta be kidding me. [ALL SCREAM] [ROARING] Come on. We have to go through. The only way we're gonna get past those things is in a rocket. Great idea. We're going to build a rocket. [ENGINE STARTS] Five, four, three, two, one. Liftoff! [ALL SIGH] [GROANS] [GASPS] The lost city of Atlantis. It's not lost anymore. Never give up. Good work, Atlantis crew. Hey, that has a nice ring to it.
