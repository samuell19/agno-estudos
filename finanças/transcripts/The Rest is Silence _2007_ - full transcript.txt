A venture undertaken by Mr. Cristian Comeaga a tragic-comic tale put on screen by Mr. Nae Caranfil THE REST IS SILENCE Theatre, gentlemen. Noble and difficult mission... Before hearing the final results, I want you all to remember this: The stage requires many inborn qualities and talent is only one of them. But talent alone won't get you far. Other things are also necessary. An imposing stature. A beautiful voice. Physical charm... You've worked hard for this entrance exam and the selection was no easy task for us. But some of you, if I may say so, were selected by nature... Some of you were not. Today, our theater needs actors who are young, tall, handsome and talented, to impersonate on stage the great heroes of our history as those gentlemen on the wall have done before you. Sorry. I'm late. May I... Please. How about making this faster, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Let's read the list. Bucharest, 1911 How do you feel about all this crowd, Madam? One may say the public salutes your husband's last stage exit. Madam? One word! Does that bring you some comfort? What advice would you give young girls who dream of marrying famous actors? Whore! Ion Belcea, National Theatre's most famous actor is no longer with us. A merciless disease took him away at the age of 43. Only five months have passed from his last appearance as Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. An immortal performance. Paragraph. The gossip says that his last wish was to attend a cinematographic show. Obviously, his severe physical condition couldn't allow this kind of... ...eccentricity. Yet, in high society circles, Belcea's passion for... low-taste entertainment was no secret. As they say: Great men have petty hobbies. Ferefide, "The Time". The widow won't talk? I'll be there in half an hour. Get some tips about the will. I want to know who gets what. Write! The biggest stars of the National Theatre are carrying the coffin... Damn you all! And may the worms of shame eat your souls! May your tongues go dry and your fingers fall off! Look, it's Tony Volbura! I thought you'd like to keep it. All your plans, together. So many sleepless nights... Plans? Dreams, Anna. Castles in Spain... He was so handsome! So? I failed. - Impossible! They all assured me... - I flunked the physical examination. I never thought they'd take that one seriously. - They always do. I was told so. - Not in my time they didn't. - That was last century. - Don't be impertinent! - But it was, wasn't it? - Shut up! You're bothering everyone. Show some respect for the ceremony! And? Was there any explanation? Are you ill? They said I have weak lungs. Nonsense! I think I'm just not tall enough. What? I'm the shortest actor alive, but I still get standing ovations! Sorry... I made a career of being short, didn't I? - Didn't I? - Dad... May his soul rest in peace. Hold it! Ladies and gentlemen. An artist is gone. I'm here to give him the epitaph he deserves. To be.... or not to be That is the question: Whether tis noble in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them> To die, to sleep... Who is this loony? This loony was close to buying our paper last year. - I still wish he did. - Why? Cause we'd have been rich now. This is Leon Negrescu, stupid. One of the ten richest landowners in this country. For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coin... That makes calamity of so long life.... For who would bear... > For who would... > That... is the question. So? Who gets what? The widow takes all, except the warehouse on Magnolia Street. That one goes to a "National Theatre Society for Animated Pictures". Specified: For shooting cinematographic plays. Kiss her hand! Passionately! On your knees! Adore her! Enter Raoul! Take him by surprise! Attack him! Fight! Tony, turn the gun towards Raoul! Closer to the heart! Closer! Shoot! Good. Now Tony... You know what to do. Perfect, stay like that. Raoul, wake up! Pick up the revolver. Your hand is shivering with pain! More shivering! - Shoot them! - Sorry. Camera reloading. Everyone freeze! Nobody moves one hair until we change the film. - I can't stay like that! - You may put your hands down. Grig, why don't you ask your Dad to play a part in this? Hands up again! Mister Grigore Ursache? - Yes. Who am I talking to? - Hugues Leroy. I represent Gaumonde Film Company. The head of our Bucharest branch would like to meet with you. Yes, of course. When does he expect me? Right now. There's a cab waiting outside. Right now? Junior, the sunlight changed. Let's move! A coin for the veterans! We fought for the Independence! Today's moving picture: "HAMLET" with the Divine Sarah The Royal Family's cruise on the Danube. The Prime Minister's son, getting married. But this was only last week! Exactly. "Speed" is the keyword here. Incredible! Who gave you all these? This is my work. "Gaumonde Newsreels". We'll start showing them before the main program. - But these are Romanian views! - Precisely. Gaumonde tries to adapt each foreign branch to its specific market. We are working like tailors, with the client's fabric. This is most interesting. The funeral of a great actor. Ion Belcea. I must be over there too. Terrible thing to die at the peak of one's career. At your age, it's hard to realize. - How old are you, by the way? - 25. I wouldn't have given you more than 20. - Would you give him more than 20? - Never. I want to ask you something. You knew Belcea well, didn't you? Sure, we were working together. Precisely. On a film libretto, if my information is correct... What are you talking about? - Something about the Independence War? - Who told you? If you have an idea you want to keep for yourself never brag about it at Caf? des Artistes. - Especially with drinking companions. - I couldn't help myself. Help yourself. The Independence War... I heard they're preparing some big celebration. Yes. For the 35th anniversary. Could be an interesting idea, a film about the war... It's a fantastic idea, believe me! Nobody ever tried anything like this before. I want to re-enact all the battles, just the way they were, with the cavalry charges, the bayonet fights and the King leading the army across the Danube... - Young man! - Yes? One question: Who is financing all this? Well... since you seem interested, I thought you would! I remember having the same enthusiasm when I was 20. - I'm 25. - Maybe it's time to grow up a little. Who is now in possession of that libretto? - We are. - Who is "we"? "The National Theatre Society for Animated Pictures". My, my... I'll tell you what. I can give you some good pocket money if you show me those pages. Bring them here, one day. I just want to have a look. Don't be silly. I know it's your idea, you shouted it all over town! But you could never have made it happen. For me, those pages are purely informative. I'll make the film with or without them. - I have news for you. I got you a job. - What job? A real one. At least it's paid. The cloakroom custody. Dad, I wonder if I'm good at that. You wonder? I can tell you. You're not. But what are you good at, if I may ask, circus acts? How can I face people, how can I still do curtain calls, with a son involved in moving pictures? Listen, son. You failed at Drama School: That's sad, but it's no shame. There are plenty of decent jobs around. You can sell fish... clean the streets... Anything useful to your fellow-men is fine with me. But the next time I see you getting close to that grinding machine I'll break it over your back! Mark my words: I've spent a lifetime making a name in this noble profession, I won't become a joke at my age because of you! Maestro! One more! Tony! Welcome to the club, Junior! Take a seat. Let me introduce you... Sit down, will you?! ...to the loveliest orchid of the Orient. Tony, we've got to talk. Gaumonde wants to make our picture. - Wonderful. - But without us! They asked to see the libretto. They say they're going to shoot the film anyway. We must move fast and find some money... Are you listening? Sure. We need money. Let's ask around. Honey, do you have some change? I could use another beer. Tony, it's serious! Aren't we partners anymore? - No. - What do you mean, no? After spending so much energy? What happens to the Society? The gods will decide. I'm too old to keep fighting. My strength is gone, my sap has weakened... Nonsense! ...and my mind, so sharp in the past, has gone soft. The time I have left, I prefer spending on Gunnay. Do you want to spend some time on Gunnay, too? - What is Gunnay? - She is Gunnay. Gunnay - Grig. - You're drunk. It makes me sick. - You're young. It'll pass. You want some news? Today I gave my resignation. - I am leaving the National Theatre. - Why? Because I don't want to end up like Belcea, writing film librettos. - I can't believe that! - All right. Because they won't let me play Hamlet. Are you crazy? The part is up for grabs. Belcea died. I volunteered and they laughed in my face. So stop boring me with your cinematic rubbish. Better go dance with Gunnay. Gunnay, ask him to dance. - I don't want to dance! - Nonsense! A girl asks you to dance, you can't refuse her. Go, both of you, leave me alone! - Who is he impersonating? - Maecenas, patron of the arts. They say he is hosting a whole army of failed geniuses! ...if you want a hot soup, invest in land... Are we dancing or... Hello. My name is Grigore Ursache, I am an artist and I would like to see Mr. Leon Negrescu... Hello... Hello? Could you bring me a glass of water? - What? - A glass of water, please? - If you have nothing else to do. - Sure! No. I don't want to drink. Throw it on me. - What? - Throw the water on me. I'm not supposed to move and it's hot. I can't do that! Don't be afraid, I'm used to cold water. Still, you could catch pneumonia... You're new around here, aren't you? Sure you don't want to drink it instead? Hey, you're blocking my view! People are trying to work here! Sorry! Now? Thanks, you were a darling. - What's going on? - Lunch. - Is the master of the house around? - Sure, he must give us his benediction. So there's free lunch for you everyday? As long as we work. And the girl? Emilia? She's not one of us. She poses for money. - Are you hungry? - Yes! - Hungry for food? - No! - Hungry for spirit? - Yes! Ready to meditate a bit on your mission before filling up your bellies? I see a new face. I don't believe I had the honor. Sir, my name is Grigore... Your name is of no interest if no work of art is linked to it. You came for the soup? You heard I was giving free meals? - No, sir... - Liar! You came for the soup. Why else would you be in the kitchen? I came to meet you. I was rejected at the Drama School and I need some advice. An actor! Rejected, too! It's a scandal, gentlemen! What has this world come up to! Talent is simply thrown into the garbage can. But tell me, Maestro... See, I'm not quite familiar with the Theatre World, are they now writing parts for nurslings? I presume they are, sir, since I know people already wearing their costume! I mean, people wearing diapers... It must be a new fashion! I mean, just like nurslings... Only they're grown-up people, wearing diapers... which are meant to pass for Roman togas... Sorry for the intrusion. Young man! Here is the main quality an artist must have in order to survive: A thick skin! I'll tell you a true story. I was six years old when our peasants attacked my father's mansion. My parents were killed before my eyes. They ploughed them. With the plough-share. They even planted seeds in them. Unfortunately this didn't lead to any crops. Twelve years later I was in Paris. Stone-broke. Wandering alone in a big foreign city. And that day, I met him. Who? A street painter. Down and out himself. Couldn't sell anything. Was he ahead of his time? Did he just lack talent? I couldn't tell. To be frank, I found his canvases horrible. Anyway, the man gave me two coins. I don't remember their value, how many francs or cents or whatever they were, I just remember two coins, and that they weighed in my hand like gold... You won't believe me. My fortune was built on those two coins. How did you do it? Roulette. But this is not important. It would have been the same had I given them to the beggars. - You know why? - Why? Because it was God's hand, not the painter's, giving me those coins. It was a sign. A secret message. Leon! I want Arts and Sciences to flourish down there! Leon! Find me worthy men, ready to glorify my splendor in their immortal works! Leon! You are the Arm of my Will! Here. My blessing. Sir, I came here to ask for a little more than two coins... In that case I will disappoint you. I never give more than two coins. Two coins is the gift. The rest is investment. This is exactly what I came for, an investment! But investment, my boy, is not giving: It's taking! If I invest in you, it means I'm going to squeeze everything out of you, including those two coins! Investing is taking the gift back. But everyone says you're a Maecenas... I do protect the Arts. Not the artists. Are you interested in Art Films? Art Films? Since when are films art? - A lot of people say they are! - Nonsense! Some friends of mine went to a picture show and what they told me... You've never seen a picture show? Not even out of curiosity? Curiosities are for the winter fair. I want a show, I go to the theatre. How about "Hamlet"? "Hamlet" with the Divine Sarah? What's that got to do with picture shows? "Hamlet" on film! With the Divine Sarah, the famous French diva... Strange. I tried to see her in Paris last year, it was sold out... The Divine Sarah shows herself in pictures? I can arrange for tickets! - No, I'm not free that evening... - I didn't say when! You're impertinent. - Sorry... - I like that. Sometimes, artists are a little disrespectful... - My case. Can't help myself! - Make it for Friday. But don't start dreaming. It's just curiosity. Hamlet? How do you hear the words if it's a photographed play? You don't hear them. You read them. Intertitles. - What? - It's... hard to explain. Grig! Here it is. - Have you seen the projectionist? - Just talked to him. He's bargaining hard, but for 40 lei he's ours. Go. I'm counting on you. Here! I'll lose this job, my kids will starve! Shut up and splice. - Art films? - The problem is tickets are so cheap. How cheap? Cheaper than "Maxim's", for example... - How cheap? - One leu. Am I displaying myself in a place where the ticket is one leu? It's double in winter, they have to heat. I'm going home, I'm not feeling well... Wait, they didn't even start! - It'll make a bad impression! - I must, my stomach aches. I need to lie down. - Get me to the car, quick! - Don't leave right now! I see some familiar faces: The Cults Minister's son! This confirms the poor opinion I have on his father. I really have to get out, I can't breathe! Too many people... These children are taking all my air! Look! It's starting! God, why did I leave home? This is not the real film, it's just for warming up! She is superb... Absolutely superb! "There is something fishy in Denmark" God help us. "Leon! You must trust this young man!" I will, Father! Nobody's ever done this before! Unraveling History in front of your eyes! We'll show all the battles, just the way they were, with the cavalry charges and the waving flags and the falling redoubts and all of our famous heroes, dying for their country... I'm sorry, Maestro. I have nothing against your son, only he didn't show up at work... - I'll get him for you. Right away. - I had to hire somebody else. I'll bring him here in half an hour. What's the matter with this boy, anyway? You'd think he's in love! Master lancu! Is it true what they say in town, he deals in moving pictures? Half an hour! "Scene 5: The army crosses the Danube." "General view over the battle" Woman! Where the devil is Martyrs' Street? In conclusion, gentlemen, this contract states my position as the main shareholder of the group with 40% of the profit. The rest is just a change of names: We shall henceforth act as "Leon Negrescu Art Film Society". Sounds better, anyway. As they say: Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's! Exactly. And now my friends, let's toast: To the triumph of our enterprise. French champagne. I guarantee that God Himself takes a sip on occasion. - To your health! - To us all! It's a family thing! - Sir, he wouldn't listen! - Maestro, what a surprise! Who is this gentleman? This gentleman must have a word with that gentleman... Dad, not now! We're talking serious business here... And you think I don't mean business myself? It's a family thing! Maestro, calm down, you'll be sick! Poor drunk! You were blessed with an ambitious and talented son whom you mistreat like a rude boor. Look at yourself: You're a wreck, a pitiful creature! If your name will ever be remembered after you die, it will be because of this kid. And after having offered this pathetic performance, kindly let us return to our affairs. Show the gentleman out. Please! Do you know whom you talked to? - His father. - True. Famed lancu Ursache, the great comedian, National Theatre's pet. Didn't you recognize him? I'll be damned! I kept wondering where had I seen this man before, but sober? Stop here! Mes hommages, dear Pache! I stopped by to break some news to you. You might like to know that my ambitious and talented son doesn't need your shitty little job that you can stick up your ass, and that my ambitious and talented son has more important things to do than to take care of your filthy cloakroom! Warm regards, Pache dearest! Cabman, Caf? des Artistes! Move on! Hey, you bastards! My son is no cloakroom custodian! You'll see! I'll go and get drunk! Love and kisses! Boyards are coming from the city! Attention everybody! I want a big round dance, fast and full of joy because it's sunshine, it's peace time and the weather is fine for the crops! That's the opening scene. Let's see it! - Music! Raoul! - Ready! Let's dance! Everybody smile! Faster! Faster! Townsfolk dancing... Let's show them a real "hora dance". Come on, everybody! Come on city boy, nobody stands still in a "hora"! Stop! Let's start over! Stop dancing, everybody! Ladies and gentlemen... listen everybody! We take a five minute break to reload the camera and we start all over again! Stop the music. We'll do it one more time. Hi. - You look different. You've changed... - You mean clothes? I didn't know you were... you know, from the countryside. You don't like country-girls? Sure I like them... It's just that I didn't know. Now I live mostly in the city, I just spend holidays here. - I want to be an actress. - Really? People say I have a good singing voice. Are you an actor too? - Can I join? - Sure! What a charming demoiselle. I have an idea with her. Something is missing in our libretto. What could that be? Our hero, Penesh... He should have a fianc?e, to wave him good-bye when he goes to war. Splendid idea! But who could play her? - I was just talking to this girl... - Idiot! Why didn't I think of it? Then it's settled. I'll tell you what you have to do. Hello, beautiful! Raoul will play your fianc?. You must pretend you're in love with him even if you don't like him. But I like him. Careful, Junior. You're trying to get two birds with one stone... - Long live the mayor! - And our guests, too! Gentlemen... Excuse me a moment. I said excuse me! I have some private business. This man is making history even as he pisses! I'm afraid the jester has long teeth... There is a bird species that lives on the crocodile's back. - Is this about the liberals? - No, it's about the African jungle. The bird lives on the animal's back and sometimes is allowed to pick up the remains of food from between his teeth. For the bird it's a feast, for the crocodile it's a matter of hygiene. That way, everybody is happy. The bird's only concern is to get out of the crocodile's mouth before he feels like closing it. Otherwise, the little bird gets cleaned out of his teeth by another little bird... The beast doesn't make the difference, see? I wonder where has Junior disappeared. - I have my suspicions. - Really? Let's go find him. - Ready? - Not yet! Ready! I'm here! It's so good! Don't you want to jump in? I'd rather finish my cigarette first. It's so hot, how can you stand all those clothes? In the city we're used to living dressed. Are you also used to this? You really seem to like cold water. I'd dabble from morning till night. But now I have to work, pay my classes... Classes? Yes, I'm a student! I only come home during summer. - A student... where? - At the Conservatorium. Music? No, Drama! I told you I want to be an actress. Grig! Where are you? Junior! - They eventually found us... - They mustn't! Let's hide. - We shouldn't, they'll get worried. - But I've no time to dress! Look, I know a place not far from here. A little glade, you'll find it as you walk along the bank. Take my clothes and wait for me there. - How will you get there? - Swimming, of course. You know what? Forget the clothes. We don't need them, do we? Where are you? I'm here. What are you doing here? I'm meditating. Sit down beside me. Wonderful night! A night for lovemaking... If you want. A little too hot, though. Maybe... Imagine, the millions and millions of tiny creatures living in this pond we are unaware of? And then think of the Universe... How insignificant we must be. It's frightening. What are you thinking of? Underwater creatures... I'm thinking about the future, kid. I see fabulous things coming our way. The times we live in! You realize how everything is changing? All these inventions! Cinema... There is something in the air, some sort of divine grace. - Want a cigarette? - No. The 20th century will be the best. Angels will watch over us, great people will be born and peace will reign. Do you believe it, kid? Do you? Yes, I do... Then we will conquer the Universe. We are not abandoned creatures groping in the marsh, are we? No, we aren't. Don't you feel that, as we speak, there is an eye, here somewhere, watching over us? Stop! Stop for a second! "THE WARAGAINST THE TURKS" "An Overwhelming Picture Show" Move on! Miss, give me "The Time". It's urgent. Listen, Ferefide. I have a job for you. What do you know about the new Gaumonde picture show? The one they advertise all over town, about the war against the Turks... I was expecting more from you. Now look: Do you still want my help to pass the Bar? Leon, I'd kiss your feet! Then listen well: I need something juicy about Gaumonde and their film. What scenes does it show. Who's playing. What sets did they use. The more compromising, the better. You have three hours. No, three hours. That's all. I'm waiting for your call before noon. Children, we have to wait. The good Christians amongst you, start praying. The others, have some brandy. It says here your hospitalization was paid by Gaumonde... Yes, the French is paying! They had to! We're just poor Jews! What's Gaumonde's responsibility? How did the accident happen? - We couldn't jump over that ditch! - What ditch, you idiot? They dug a trench and they asked us to jump over it. - At our age, that's no piece of cake. - Five years ago I could have done it! I was strong as a bull! One moment! What trench? What were you supposed to do? Fight against the Turks for Gaumonde! Play the infantry, in the Glorious War. We are now martyrs of Independence too! Interesting... Alright. Stay there. And call me back in a few minutes. We got them. The stingy French worked with a suburb theatre some of you must have heard of: Jignitza. - So what? - It's a Jewish theatre. I don't get it. No wonder you don't get it, kid, you're too green to get it! Get me the Chief of Police! This is Colonel Gutza, Chief of the City Police. I'm Nutzu Ferefide, journalist. Pleased to meet you. Take a seat. - Care for a drink? - No. No time for formalities. We heard you made a film... Reconstruction of our War of Independence. True? And why not? As you might know, we created branches all over Europe to offer specific products for each market. I can explain the details of our strategy, but I insist you accept a glass of cognac. No thanks. What I want, Mr... - Duffin. Raymond Duffin. - Right... is to see the film. I'm afraid this is not possible. - Really? - It's a matter of self-protection. We keep the utmost secrecy of our films before their public premiere. I'm sure you understand why. We are very flattered by your impatience, but you only have three more days to wait. I'll wait ten minutes, mister... No public premiere before I see the film. Get it? It's an abuse, gentlemen. This is not just any film we are talking about... You are playing with our people's national feelings and we must make sure that it doesn't contain anything offensive. Some important figures played a part in this war and are still living today, His Majesty the King, for example. The truth is, Mr. Duffin, that you're about to touch a delicate chord... We're wasting time. The film, please. "THE WARAGAINST THE TURKS" So this is how it starts... Yes. The army crossing the Danube. You find this offensive? This is the Danube for you? We couldn't afford to go there, so we used the local river. It's not the real war, you know, it's just a show. Some show, I can tell you! Some show! With all respect, you are not qualified to judge my work. There is something strange here. The faces... They seem to be kind of... Jewish, don't they? That's absurd! Where did you find these men? I must remind you that your laws guarantee the confidentiality of our affairs. I don't have to answer these questions. Look: Jews! Frankly, your Romanian army looks damn Jewish! - This is a false impression. - False impression my ass! Look at those faces! Is this our cavalry? Hugues, bring all the personnel in here. Tell me, Mr. Duffin: If I wrote an offensive article about the French Revolution, what would you t Ink? I would grant you the right of personal opinion. This is precisely what the French Revolution was about! Freedom of thought. Ladies and gentlemen, I want your honest opinion. Look at the screen: Do these people look Jewish to you? No. No, sir. Not at all. Here it is: Freedom of thought. You're showing a wonderful spirit of democracy, Mr. Duffin. But may I ask who are those two characters inspecting the army? Well! Ajournalist who doesn't recognize his King and Prime Minister! That's what I thought... Colonel, these are the Blumenfeld brothers. They are famous for doing licentious routines for variety shows. What do you know! Mister Frenchman has probably thought that once they're on the screen, we can't open their pants and check them out! - Lights! I've seen enough. - But... Lieutenant, do your duty! You're not going to arrest me, are you? Not you. Just the film. Sure you don't want him arrested? 48 hours intimidating routine? That's not necessary. We should however notify the Palace that a lese-majesty crime has been avoided. I will personally see to it. And your contribution won't be forgotten. I've always counted on you. What should we do with the film? No idea. Any suggestions? I have a simple solution. Burn it. Burn it? You mean... It's flammable? Ready, Sir! Proceed! Stupid! I should have seen it first! Maybe it was good... Film... It catches fire so easily... Easier than canvas. Easier than paper... Can one build a lasting work out of such frail material? His Majesty King Carol I of Romania! Good day, gentlemen! Your Majesty... I'm glad to see you, Leon. You look... in good shape. Your Majesty, the members of "Leon Negrescu Art Film Society" are grateful for your enlightened benevolence. Charming... Charming... Gentlemen, I heard about your noble initiative and I want to congratulate you. It's time the youngsters learned a thing or two about their elders' sacrifices. I talked to my financial advisers and I decided to offer you a little support from the Royal treasury. Not too much, because the country is poor. I am curious to know who is going to play my part. Me, Sire. You, then... Charming... charming... Why not you? I was chosen to play the Pasha, Sire. Speak louder. He is playing the Turkish commander, Sire. Osman Pasha. Osman? Nonsense! You're too young to play Osman. You look just like me at 40. I see you in my part. May I... Your Majesty is too generous and I am deeply flattered. Still, I think it's too great a part for my humble abilities... You will do.
