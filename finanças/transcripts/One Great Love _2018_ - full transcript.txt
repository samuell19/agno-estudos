--== McEphie ==-- Whether we're happy about them or not. Are you sure it's Sinatra street? Maybe Manay Neri got a prank call. That was what the customer said. Why don't you just use Waze? There's no Sinatra street in this subdivision. What? Wait. I think this is it. Sumatra Street? For heaven's sake, it's Sumatra, not Sinatra. I think Manay Neri already has hearing problems. All right. Bye. Miss Peggy, Miss Patty, all our fruits and vegetables come from our farm in Tagaytay. All of them are organic. And here are our cleansing juices. Do you guarantee that we will lose weight in one week? That fast? Not really one week, You'll lose weight in three-to-six months. -Really? -Three to six months of pure juices? I don't have any plans to join The Biggest Loser! Miss Peggy, try this, it's worth it. You won't regret it, I promise. OK, miss. -Really? Thank you! -Yes. I just came from a medical mission out of town. Your cousin Dominic will get married in Vancouver next month. I don't think I can make it, Ma. I have a lot of scheduled surgeries next month. How about you? Your dad can't wait to have a grandchild. There's no need to hurry. I'll be there this Christmas. Your dad wants to sell the house. But I haven't decided yet. I'm sure you don't want to either. I'll think about it. Whether to sell the house or not, OK? I grew up here. I became a man in this house. And you'll become a single old man, I'm afraid. Wow, that's good news, Zyra. Your food business is already picking up. And sooner or later, you'll open an organic restaurant. That's our wish, Auntie. Nowadays, everyone is health-conscious. That's right. That's why our orders tripled so fast. -Really? -Yes. Oh, I forgot, my guests today are vegetarian. -You two are like rabbits. -Why? You only eat salads and vegetables. Oh my, Dad. That's right, Dad. Red wine during lunch, as always. Dad, let me remind you that last time we were here, your blood pressure shot up to 150 over 100. Did my conscience bring you up here today? Did you come here only to scold me? Your dad is enjoying his life to the fullest. I don't even need any performance enhancers to have sex. I just keep going at it! -Dad, stop that! -We don't need to hear that. I wonder why you're still single. Don't be like me, Zyra. So look at me now, I fell in love with a widower. Do you regret being with my dad? No! That's not what I meant. I'm actually lucky to be with him. Eligible bachelors are rare nowadays. If they don't marry women, they marry men. But seriously, you should follow your heart. Not all women need a man to be happy. But, of course, it feels good when someone's taking care of you. Like what your father is doing for me. I'm not in a hurry. Of course we have to be careful who we choose. But... I'll get to that eventually. Don't tell me you also want your love life to be organic? Don't waste your time or you might end up with leftovers. -Hello? I'm here at my dad's place. -Hey, don't leave this. Jemy and I just went for a visit. OK, so I did three angioplasties. Two of them were senior citizens, and the other one was a 30-year-old! That's too much! A life? Are you free this Saturday at 7 p.m.? A patient gave me four tickets to a play in Solaire. If you want, you can ask Jemy and Bryan to come with us. Oh, sorry, I can't make it. I have to go to my cousin's send-off party. -Really? -Yes! I'd rather not go if you can't make it. I'll just give away the tickets. Wow, don't play mind games with me. Why don't you go on a blind date and just have fun, OK? I have orders to deliver. I have to go. A, someone had an accident. B, there's a funeral. C, someone got hit by a car. I'm here at the auto repairs shop fixing my tire. Give me around 20 minutes to get there. -Carl? -Do you want food and drinks? Yes, I got a flat tire. I'll just let the traffic pass. Good afternoon, Philippines! It's me again and my partner, DJ Tenten. Why didn't you tell me that you were not coming? I've been waiting for hours. You jerks! You bastards! You're an outsider, right? Then she loses a gentleman for a boyfriend. Her loss. Wait! Why are you throwing those away? Why don't you just give them to me? I'll just give you a new bunch of flowers. You're right partner! Even in love... You're here again? Let me guess, you two got back together? I told you, you deserve better. As written in this article, partner, Do you agree? -It depends. -I totally agree, partner. In any relationship, both parties have to work hard -What if he doesn't? -You agree there's a forever, partner? Are you really asking me? -There's no forever in this world. -Forever stupid exists! We are not immortals, to seek for forever. -So be it! -How about "till death do us part"? I believe in "one great love," but not forever. There's no forever, but we can find... Sometimes that person's name will always come up. Why are you giving me this? So that you will remember me as the boy who hates flying. Can you look at these new designs? Which one is better? This one or this? Sis. Hey! I saw Carl today. You saw Carl, or you've met with Carl? There's a difference. He didn't see me. Are there still fireworks in your heart right now? Don't even answer me, sis, I already know what you're gonna say. But let me remind you. Jemy, I'm just telling you what happened today. Wait a minute. Why do I get this feeling that you're still affected by this? That's all in your head. Shit, Poch Mortel! Please be mine. If you'd be mine, I could die anytime. You've been playing this cheap model's video all night long! FYI, he is an international model. You mean an athlete's foot or fungal ointment model. Or maybe, model for flavored condoms. Why are you so insecure? Do you have abs? Let me see! Hey, don't do it! You're just jealous of me! Don't show them your abs. Don't you worry, baby, these are for your eyes only. He's here! -He's here? -Who? Poch Mortel? No, James is here. -Yes, James. -James! Oh my God, is he your new boyfriend? -No, he's going to be your boyfriend. -Yes, sis! Let's get him. -What's that? -We set you up for a blind date tonight. Jemy, you know I don't do blind dates. This isn't what we talked about. Don't mess up my life! -I have to go. -Sis! Just wait up and see! Sis! Tonight... You live in that house? -Let's not leave her! -Let's go! Kids these days! They have no self-control! Zyra, here are the other research papers. Why are these late? I've done the PowerPoint already! I still have to study! Hey, relax. Here. What is this? Can I see? Wait, I know this. OK, let me do your presentation. -No. You might change stuff, I got this. -No. -I can handle this. -Just relax, OK? Continue reviewing. I'm just here. I'm not going anywhere. Hey, sis, are you done acting up? Where are you? You looked possessed, what happened? We're still here at the bar. You better come back. -Your blind date left already. -Jemy. -What? -Jemy, can I just call you back? Let's talk later at home. Wait, where did you go? Why are you whispering? I'm inside the cinema! You're watching a film? You went alone and left us here? -Who are you with? -No one! It's just me. I'm in a bad mood right now. I have my period. -Are we good? OK, bye! -OK, bye. We're inside a cinema! You're not in a marketplace! -Can you just get out of here? -Why don't you two leave? Continue what you're doing in motel. A short time only costs 300 pesos. Of all days to leave the charger at home, why does it have to be now? I want to be the first passenger on your first flight. Of course! That is, if I'm able to fly. Why wouldn't you? That's why I prefer being one of the ground crew. That's boring. Sure. Actually, me being a pilot is my dad's decision. But I love my dad so I obeyed him. Hi. Where's my coffee? I placed it right here, ma'am. I'll just leave it here OK? If you're not in a hurry? I'm on my way home. I just dropped by for take-out. Coffee is better when you're talking to someone. If only you'd not been with your boyfriend that time, and not in a hurry, I would have invited you for coffee. Is she your cousin? Oh, yes. Dawn? She's actually the official photographer for our other relative's 18th birthday party. I see, I thought she was your girlfriend. -Girlfriend? -Yes. No, she's not my girlfriend. Everyone thinks we're together because we're that close. But that won't ever happen because aside from us being cousins, she has a different sexual orientation. She actually has a girlfriend. I was wrong. So, are you still with your boyfriend? I just wanted to give a polite excuse, that's why I said that. I'm sure you have a lot of pictures of women in your phone. You mean... a collection of girls' photos? Not just that. I also mean collection of girlfriends. Don't say that. Of course, you're still the most beautiful girl I've met. Here. Let me take a video. Why did you leave? Why was it so easy for you to forget me? I was the only one who was hopeful. I was the only one who was stupid in this relationship. OK, I'll see you. Hi, sis. What are you guys doing? Where were you? We got home before you did. Sis! Hey! Why was it so easy for you to forget me? Did you receive my welcome gift? Plus a French wine as a bonus. I think it's here. Jake, wait a second! OK, bro. -You're crazy! -Enjoy, bro! Wait. Are you sure? -Too bad! -I'm not like I was before. Why did you leave? That means you're not yet a candidate for an angiogram or any cardio procedure. In other words, What seems to be the problem, bes? Bes, the palpitations I had last night were so loud that my left ear could hear them! I got paranoid! It's the first time that's happened to me. But, bes... not everyone who experiences palpitations has heart problems. What is it? Nothing! -Nothing? -That's true! OK, I have to go. Thank you so much for this. -Bye, bes. -Bes, wait. Can I have one hour with you? I'm a little bit down today. Oh, so the heart doctor has a love problem? That's OK. You know, the feeling is mutual. Come on, let's have coffee. after our summit conference in Cebu. I bumped into Tessa at an art exhibit. So, apparently, she's based there together with her artist husband. Did you guys talk? For a bit. I learned that she already has two kids. She seems happy. Are you still hurting? Is it still affecting you? Of course, bes. It has only been one-and-a-half years. I haven't completely moved on. I was the one who was left behind, you know. Anyway, she was asking about you and if you're already married. I said, she doesn't even have a boyfriend, what more a husband? Maybe there are friendships that just don't go deeper, you know? Well at least since she introduced me to you, our friendship has remained intact until now. I may have lost a girlfriend, but I gained a best friend. Is it really hard to move on and let go of someone especially if you're not sure if he really loved you or if you were really ever a part of his life? Tell me, who has the worst problem here. You or me? By the looks of it, you seem to have come from a really bad break-up. Because... Carl and I met again. I don't know. -Move on, stupid! -Move on, stupid! Sorry, sir, but your flight to Singapore was cancelled. OK, thank you. Be generous with the food portions! I don't want the customers to think we're cheating them. How about you, are you following the measurements? -Yes, ma'am. -Those should be exact, OK? Are you sure these greens aren't rotten? -Are these fresh? -Yes. Sis, can you answer the phone? Replace these with better ones. Please don't ask me how I got your number. We're quite busy right now. I still have orders to deliver. Can I see you? I have a lot to tell you that I didn't get to say the last time we met. Let's end this thing. And I kept telling myself, "Move on, stupid!" I thought you wouldn't be able to make it tonight. You said that we needed to talk. You're right. But I will be asking the questions. And you have a lot to answer. Do you believe in coincidences, Zyra? When people just meet out of the blue? Remember all those times when we bumped into each other? That's serendipity. Are we really going to talk... The reality is, after you made all those promises, you just led me on and left without a word. I know it's my fault. I've made so many mistakes in my life already. I really want to fix this. I really want to start over, but... I got lost and I didn't know how and where this ended. I remember clearly. I remember that you left me hanging for so long. I will not force you to understand everything. You have said what you had to say. And I have expressed myself fully. It's still with you. Can we go back to step one? No! We just talked. Talked? Are you a child? He's been gone for too long. I'm sure he already edited his story. You know what, sis? A man who breaks promises has twisted balls. He'll only play with your feelings. And if he really loved you, he'd have made a way to talk to you even if a million tourists tried to stop him. It's like this, sis. If his story is fragmented and seems incomplete, chances are, he's lying. Forget about the past! Let's do some Q and A. Do you still love him? -When we met... -Sis, yes or no? Which is it? Love or infatuation. Sis, you're so stupid! Do you still have this illusion of being with him? After you've waited four years in vain? You know what? Nowadays, you really need someone to plan your life. A man doesn't believe in destiny if he suddenly disappears from your life. Zyra, can we go back to step one? His balls are twisted. He'll just play with your feelings! He doesn't believe in destiny. Why are you so weak, Zyra? You're so hopelessly cheap! Don't be a victim, girl. Move on, stupid! Zyra, this mail is for you. That looks like a wedding invitation! Who will get married? I don't know who, apart from Jemy. Is it really a wedding invitation? Who will get married? Aren't you supposed to be doing something else? -Yes, you're right. -Yes. Go. -Carl, wait! What's this? -Let's go. You said you wanted to be my first passenger, right? Let's go! I thought you hated flying? But I love you, so... I won't leave you hanging. -It's beautiful! -Yes, it's beautiful! Let's do this often. Beautiful! Here you go! Too bad Zyra's not here. She'll be back after two days. She didn't mention anything to me. Where did she go? I think she accepted her lover boy's invitation. Thanks. Zyra's not here, didn't she tell you? She went out of town. Did they get back together? My father was involved in a case in the military. It was just too much for him, the scandals and the embarrassment. Do you regret... that you waited for me? I've made that choice. Whether it was right or wrong... Even if it was sad most of the time. I think that's just life. I think I should be asking that question because... Doc, here are the results of Mr. Padilla's blood test. And when did you learn how to cook, Captain Mauricio? I'm nervous and scared... Wait a second. What? Dad? Don't cry yet. I'm still alive. I haven't written my last will and testament yet. I asked the Lord for a time-out. Dad, this is no time for jokes. I told you to watch your diet. You won't listen. Please don't scold me now, OK? Aunt, what happened to dad? The vice mayor sent him a suckling pig. And he almost consumed the entire thing! I saved the head for another dish. -What? Dad! -I told you guys, I won't die yet. I still have a long life to live. Dad, when will you listen to us? You're so stubborn. Maybe your father already wants to die so he can be with your mother! Had I known his plan, I wouldn't have panicked every time he got sick! That's enough. I don't want to die yet. Life is so wonderful when I'm with you. And I don't want to leave you a widow. It's your fault. -You're such a voracious eater. -Don't be upset. Uncle. You're scheduled for an angiogram tomorrow, OK? We need that to make sure there's no more blockages in your arteries. How are you feeling? Actually, Doc, I want to ask you something. You and Zyra have known each other for a long time now. You're such a slow mover. Slow? You don't play your cards right, Ian. You're too preoccupied with work. You know that "bes" thing of yours? That's only for teenagers. My daughter's love life is already on red alert, Ian. Someone might win her instead. You're so slow. Dad, stop it. -What do you mean, slow? -A slowpoke! Hey. Ian, courting a girl... is like cooking a steak. When you cook it too long, you lose all the juices. The meat becomes tough... and dry. It won't be tender anymore. -If you want it... -Dad. get it. You know what, Dad? You're one sick matchmaker. Like a showbiz couple. Just friends! They always say that. Yes, we're back together. So, there's no need to move on? It seems like you're happy. So, I hope this continues for you. How about you? Are you over Tessa? I really hope the heart will be digitalized one day, so you can program it to fall in and out of love. How? You're not doing anything! It's like you just let your heart stop beating. How can you say it has stopped beating? Is there something I should know? Good friends don't keep secrets from each other. All right, I'll be right there. Bes, I have to go. I still have another patient to see. Go ahead! Just remember, if you meet that person, give her your heart, OK? I will definitely give my heart! Mel, can you check the box inside? Is that your pilot boyfriend's flight? Are you guys going to see each other? I really don't know. He flies all the time. Why isn't he calling? He can call even if he's abroad, you know. Are you sure that pilot is single? Yes, of course he is. -He's very single. -That is what he told you. What now, sis? Your ghost lover boy has disappeared again? It's "now you see him, now you don't" once again? Maybe he's waiting for another sign or serendipity. You know what? Men who don't want to be seen should be left unseen. What if something unexpected happened? Why do you keep making excuses for him? Are you going to let history repeat itself? You gave in so fast. What's this? Can you just stay out of this, OK? You know what, sis? But you're not a pathetic bitch who is only needed when a man wants her. You never learn, Zyra. Maybe this is a wrong number? Looks like you're busy with your own love story. Are you bored? No. OK, bes, you better get going. It's getting dark. Of course! I know, you miss Tessa. And that is a substitute hug. I'm over her. I think... I should be the one asking for your advice. About what? You want to talk about it? No, it's OK. Go home and rest. You still have an early surgery tomorrow. -Yes, you're right. -Let's go, come on. Bes? Thank you. I really had fun tonight. Yes, that's pretty obvious, so rest and prepare for your surgery tomorrow. And I'm sure that after you've read this, you'll see me as the worst man you have ever met. That's it? Even my common sense! Why did he do this to me? That jerk! Let's go, we'll take you home. -I'll stay here! -What happened here? Heartbreak queen, is that you? What's happening to you, girl? That's my Versace jacket, girl! What's wrong with you? What does he have that you have to behave that way? My Versace jacket! Bes? Where did you guys go for happy hour? Hello, Ian? This is Rica. Zyra's too drunk, she passed out. What happened? She drank too much alcohol on an empty stomach. Thank goodness you're there for her, Ian. Always ready for emergencies. Careful. -Come on, sis. -Jemy. -Hurry, get some water, please. -Yes, OK! Be careful! There you go. Do you love me? Or... do you still love Tessa? Why do the people we love... hurt us all the time? Meanwhile, here we are. You know what? Why can't we be us? You'll be mine, and I'll be yours. The two of us! But you're always busy. You don't have time to love again. Can you just cut open my chest and throw my heart far enough that no one can find it? Besides, no one will ever love me. I love you, bes. I don't know how, I don't know why. It just happened. Move on, stupid! Manong Jerry, can you give this to madam, please? -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you! Come on, you know this is bad for you. This will never happen again. -I'll protect you. -I've heard that before! What are you doing? What is your problem? Do you own this road? This isn't yours! Who do you think you are? I never learned. You already killed me before, and you are killing me again. I wish you had never come back. I wish you had never come back into my life! I'm ready to listen if you're ready to talk about it, bes. Why are some guys like that? Confusing, selfish. And they don't care if they are hurting the ones who love them so much. That was so bitter. If you'd known me before you met Tessa... would you have loved me? If we didn't know each other, would you want someone like me? Is it difficult to love someone like me? Is it hard to take me seriously? No, it's not, bes. I think... it's the other way around. Because you're just focused on one person. You know, way back in college... I was so scared of dating. I was scared of having a boyfriend. I was usually invisible to boys... and I felt ugly. Until I met Carl. He changed all that. He helped me overcome all my insecurities. That is why it's really hard for me to forget him. Until you saw... each other again. I thought we'd have another chance. I thought... we could continue what we started before. Earlier, I saw him with another woman. It hurts! It hurts so much! What was that for him? An ego trip? He was just playing with me? What about me? What is this? I feel so pathetic. Bes, no, stop that! Is this a pity party? That's enough. What if we become us? What if you become mine? That's it. I'll forget about Carl. everything will just be thrown away. -Move on, stupid! -Move on, stupid! Stupid! OK, that's enough. That's enough. Dad? -Dad? -My princess has arrived. This is an unscheduled visit. You know what? I dreamt about you last night. That you already had a boyfriend who loved to cook, and wanted to compete with me in the kitchen. Let's not talk about relationships, Dad. I've missed you and I just want to relax. Oh, I've missed you too baby. She's has a problem, I know. I'll cook for you, not steak. I just bought it. Hey, what's with the surprise visit? Zyra, I don't know any pleasant goodbyes. After hurting me again, I don't want to expect anything anymore. Really? Zyra, letting go is different from moving on. Jemy is right. A man who doesn't want to be seen should remain unseen. Carl is a part of my past already. when the first one that I loved so much can hurt me so much, too? Because the one true great love has no ending. It only has wonderful beginnings. -Wait, I have one last wish! -OK, go ahead. This is for Doc Ian and Zyra. Wait a minute! Why us? We are not the ones getting married. You guys have been friends for so long, you're always in the friend zone. But we know, and it shows, that for Doc, you are special. Hey, stop that! Don't put her on the spot. No! As they say, the best foundation for a long-lasting marriage is great friendship. That's true! Look at me and Bryan. We've been best friends since high school. Right, sis? But this day is for you and Bryan. We shouldn't be talking about us. We are just the guests. Ian, I have one question for you, OK? You know what, that's enough. Let's just eat. -No, don't answer that. -Ian, what's your answer? What? I told you. Here, have some coffee. -It's quite a rainy night. -Yeah, I know. Do you have someone special right now? Yes. Who? You. Bes, what if... What if... What did I tell you, guys? It's the two of you after all! Dad, come on... Let's continue. There. Where is that pretty baby? -Hi, Daddy! -Where is that pretty baby? That smells good! What is this again? I came home early for this. What made you do all this? That's the day I proposed to you, You're so sweet! It's just the two of us here! -Bes, aren't we going to eat? -We can do that later. -Yes, but I told you to change this. -Is this it? -Ian. -Hi. Remember my instructions, OK? -Hi, bes! -Here's my cute niece! Kiss your aunt! By the way, bes, I have a medical mission next week. Dr. Garrido called me. You know what, you can now be canonized in the Vatican. You know what, Jemy? -Are you OK over there? -Stay right here, OK? -Did you guys eat already? -No, not yet. Let's order. Hey! Our loyal customers! Sis. Sis, come here. Do you remember Miss Patty and Miss Peggy? Wow, you're so sexy! Congrats, Miss Peggy. We are so happy for you. That's because of your healthy body diet plan. My sister right here wants to try it out. Of course! -We have a new diet plan just for you! -Wow, a new diet plan! -I'll strictly follow this diet plan. -You better! So, you think I can make it? Yes, of course. So you can wear a bra top, too. Just like her! -Hey, Bry, where is Micmac? -Over there! -Over there with his nanny! -Bryan, can you get over there. -Bes, just a moment. -Play with your son. OK. Go! Sis, I have a surprise for you. What is it? -I hope it's a girl this time. -I know! But I haven't told Bryan yet, so let's keep it a secret for now. How about you? When are you planning to have another child? Maybe not anytime soon. Lace still has medical concerns. As you know, she was born a "blue baby" so her heart is not as strong. Isn't it ironic? Your husband is a great heart surgeon but your child has a heart problem. But don't worry. I'm sure your husband can treat her. Don't forget to give her new medication, OK? I tried. But she cries every time I give her the medication. OK, try mixing it with her cereal or milk. She won't notice the bitter taste. -I won't be long. -OK. I'll be home as soon as... The world is so small for the two of us. Zyra, I know what I did was unforgivable. Don't you have anything else better to do in your life than to explain all your mistakes? I have a family now. How about you? How many women have you victimized? You've already ended this three years ago. I'm happy now. So if until now you can't make up your mind, Nanny, don't let Lacey run around. -Lacey. -Bryan, watch me so you'll learn how to cook. Lace, don't run, you might trip! Ian, have you seen this fish? Hey, sis, what's the problem? Is there something wrong? Did you and Ian fight? He doesn't look the type who fights. -Don't run around too much... -Daddy! I saw Carl again yesterday. I don't want to say it, but... it feels serendipitous. You know what? I don't believe your serendipity meet ups. They're so corny! I thought this would never happen again. I just don't understand. What is it that you don't understand? The reason why you keep seeing each other? Or the feeling you have every time you see him? She's sweating already! Ian, what happened to my grandchild? Bes, let's recharge for a while. Bes, you know we can't just go and leave Lace that long. Of course not. We'll bring her with us. I just want to travel somewhere far like Palawan or Bohol. Just the three of us. Why are you clingy all of a sudden, Mrs. Arcaño? We can start that tonight, you know? Where do you want to go? I'll do anything... Baby, Mommy's here. Ida! Did you notice his lips turning blue after hyperventilating? No, Doc. Hello, bes? I have a patient right now. Bes, it's Lace. It's Lace, bes. My baby. Stay with Mommy, please. -Doc, zero heart rate. -Baby? Bes, our daughter... I'm sorry, sir, you're not allowed in here. I'm a doctor. And she's my daughter. Do something! Why aren't you answering my texts and calls? I just want to be left alone for now. Just like before? I want us to be whole again. Even though Lace is gone now. What happened to our daughter is still too painful. -To extend my condolences for your baby-- -You really have some nerve! Can't you see? I just lost a child! And here you are again! What? I just want to hear you tell me that you forgive me. She fooled me into thinking that I was the father of her child. So, we got married in the States. But before all that, Because... I knew this would all be unfair to you. And I found out too late that I was not the real father. I felt guilty. Because... you might not believe me anymore. You taught me how to be strong. You said... But now here you are, telling me that you're scared of dealing with your sins. You're always on my mind. You just kept coming back, Zyra. I thought I could handle life without you. But I can't. Manang, keep it neat and clean. Take them out and throw them away already. Make sure all our orders are complete. HOW ARE YOU? SAME TIME, SAME PLACE. I'm just not in the mood. What is this? I only came here to tell you to back off. We are done! I'm married! I am happy! Look at this! I am married! Stop this! Enough! Stop this! I really love you! Do you understand that? I love you so much! And it hurts! It hurts because I am here now and I'm free! But you're already married. I thought you wouldn't be home from Iloilo until tomorrow? Bes, are you free on Saturday? I will be on leave that day. I have a seminar to attend, sponsored by a wellness organization from Sydney. I see. All right, I'll take you there. No, it's fine. I'll be fine. Thank you. This is Wally. -Ian, what's wrong? -Bry. You've drunk quite a lot already. What's the problem? I'm sorry, Bry. I really needed someone to talk to. OK. So, what's the problem? Tell me. Do I look like some stupid husband? One who can easily be left behind for someone else? Maybe... It's that I'm just a pushover. I'm starting to get mad at myself. That's enough. You've had too much to drink. That son of a bitch. That asshole! Jemy. I bought something for you. They say it removes stretch marks. Hey, is there a problem? Yes. You are the problem. Why? What's your problem? Ian knows you're seeing Carl. Can you stop this nonsense? You're already married! My name is Ian. Zyra's husband. That's not just for me. That one is for Zyra. You have repeatedly messed up her life. Now that she's happy, you come back. For what? To ruin her again? To leave her hanging again? I love my wife. I hope you understand that. Dad, do you still think about Mom? Where is this coming from? But... I'll answer that. Yes, I think about her every day, consciously and unconsciously. But when your Aunt Annie is around, I snap out of it. You know what, my child? Is Mom your one great love? Yes, of course. But... you know what, my child? Just because it's our one great love does not mean it is always right. If it controls your mind, your heart and your life, and you're not happy anymore, then it can destroy you. Hey. Why are you crying? Zyra? Ian is your husband. He should be your one great love. That's enough. Are you tired? I know you're tired. Because you're not happy anymore. Even after Lace was taken from us. But deep inside, I knew... what could make you happy. Or who. I wanted you to love me, too. And although I knew you still loved him, I brought myself to believe that you could love me, too. And when Lace came... Even for a little. Even for just a moment. But when our child died... Carl came back. to have this meeting here in your home. To make you guys feel more comfortable. we'll be able to work on your annulment faster. Attorney, let me be the reason for the annulment. I mean, she filed it because... I let her down. I am the problem. What about infidelity? If the wife was the one who was unfaithful? When you come home later tonight... I might be gone already. I will do anything... Mom, please tell dad that I've met with the buyer. I have decided to sell this house. You never left. You were always there. You never left me behind, not once. Nothing less. Always more. Can I be part... of your life... again?
