NETFLIX PRESENTS No! "Binding indicates a psychic condition of impediment or inhibition and a sense of domination, determined by a powerful malign influence, which affects a person's autonomy and capacity to decide and choose." Binding, commonly known as the evil eye, is carried out through magic rituals that establish the binding between victim and practitioner. These practices have long been rooted in the South of Italy. THE BINDING Sofia! What the fuck are you doing? Mom, you swore! -Idiot! -Ouch! I'll get my revenge. Come on, hon, sit properly. What's up? Nothing. You've been working since we left. You haven't looked out once. I'd get lost in these fields as a boy. I've never seen a photo of you as a boy. Don't tell my mother. She'll bring out those from infancy to the conservatory. I want to see them all. No. Don't joke. She'll make me play all my old scores. She still has them, conserved like relics. She's very old-school. She'll like you. Maybe you should have told her first. No. A surprise! Hey! Hello! -What's his name? -Tito. Hi, Tito. -Does he bite? -No, but he really stinks. Watch! Tito! Come here! I didn't think it was so big. She should move to the village, instead of being here alone. Teresa's not alone. Hi, Sabrina! This is Emma. Emma, it's a pleasure. And this is Sofia. -Welcome. -Thank you. You need a hand? No, I can still manage this! -I'll take mine! -OK. -This way. -Let's go. -How are you? -Tired, but it was a good trip. -That's beautiful! -See? Don't touch! Sofia! I prepared the rooms upstairs. Thank you, Sabrina. That's me. -Glad you've lost the mustache! -I like you like that! Is that your mom? Yes, a few years ago. -Where is she? -She'll be here in a moment. If you need me, I'll be in the kitchen. Thank you. Come on, this way. Come on. We'll look at them later. Sofia? Come on. It is too heavy? No, no. I'm sleeping here and you're there. It's traditional. We're not married, we can't sleep together. -Are you serious? -Yes, it's serious, it's really... But I want to sleep on my own! You can't. Unfortunately, that's how it is. We're not married, we can't sleep together. Sofia? Mom, look. What are they doing? I don't know, hon. But it's none of our business. Here you are! Mom! Let's go. Who's this girl? Sofia. -Hello, Sofia. You settled in? -Yeah, upstairs. This is Emma. Sorry for the welcome, I had things to deal with. It really is a pleasure to meet you, Teresa. My son finally managed to bring you here. It must be for a very important reason. Right, Sofia? You have the most beautiful eyes. This place is magnificent. Thank you. It's everything I have. It took so many sacrifices. You must have a lot to do. -Speaking of which, how's it going? -You know, it's complicated. Why don't you get someone to help? We've always managed on our own. We'll manage this time as well. -Let's go for a walk! -All right. Don't go too far away. It's easy to get lost here. I'll finish in the kitchen before the guests arrive. Who have you invited? The usual crowd. They wanted to see you after all this time. Mom. Wait, I'll come with you. I need to tell you something. See you later. Come on, Mom, let's go. You see how beautiful she is? I seal my life with your precious blood. I seal my salvation with your precious blood. I seal my family with your precious blood. I seal my dear ones, precious blood. May your blood preserve us from evil and protect us. What was that? An old prayer from these parts. It's recited to protect the family and those who're about to join it. My son's getting married. Congratulations! Thank you. In that case, let's have a toast! -Cheers! -Cheers! Was your daughter born in Italy? No, I moved here when she was a year old. -And what do you do? -Real estate, villas. So you work in Milan, Rome...? No, abroad mostly. -What about the girl? -If it's a long trip, she comes with us. Doesn't it bother you being away from home? I'm used to it now. Is she used to it as well? A child needs stability, no? -You finished with the third degree? -Will it be a church or civil wedding? Have you chosen a date? It's beautiful. We could get married here. -Seriously? -Yeah, let's have it here! Sorry, Mom, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Hey. I can't get it out. Let's see. Everything OK? I'd never seen you pray before. My mother cares about these things. She even invited the priest! Come here. Come here! Come here, Tito! Here! Look! You want it? Fetch! Tito? Tito? Wait! Tito! Tito, wait! Tito! What are you up to? Tito ran away! -Mom, this tree is so big! -It's over a thousand years old. Why have those other trees been dug up? Because they're sick. I'll tell you a secret. My mother knows how to heal them. Really? Like a sort of magic? Exactly. Magic. But don't tell anyone. -He's good with Sofia. -She adores him. At times I get a bit jealous. You're lucky to have found a father for her. Sofia already has a father. Of course, I'm sorry. Why did you get divorced? We were too young. When Sofia was born, it was already over between us. -But we stayed friends. -It can't be easy with your job. A lot of people would pay to be in my place. And Francesco loves traveling. He's always been like that. Brahms' Quintet for Piano and Strings. That's how I met him. At a chamber concert. He was extraordinary. But he's not comfortable on bigger stages. He could always try again. Well done! -Mom, did you hear? I played it all! -You're very good! And why are you so good? Because I have the best teacher ever! Don't be jealous of them. The bond with a mother is indissoluble. It went well. You did well. You even survived the interrogation from my relatives. Your mother doesn't give much away. No. I know her. -She's happy for us. -Are you happy? What do you think? I like the idea of getting married here... where you grew up. We can think about it. What is it? Sofia? Well? Someone was spying on us. -Who? -Sabrina. -What are you saying? -I thought I saw her. That's impossible, come on. Love, it's an old house, it's full of drafts. You heard a noise and got a fright. Everything's all right. Why is her arm covered in scars? Look, Sabrina had problems, my mother started to look after her, she helped her. They're very close. Honey? What happened? I don't know, it hurts. What? Let me see. It's nothing serious. It'll be OK now. Everything OK? She was bitten. Shouldn't we take her to hospital? Let me see. No, we'll put something on it and everything will be fine. Sofia, remember what I told you about the trees? My mother can also do it with people. -What's that? -Some medical herbs. An old remedy that relieves the pain and disinfects the wound. I know, it's sore. But you're strong, aren't you? That's it. You were very good. Will you stay and sleep with me? Of course. -Good morning, Emma. -Good morning. You must have got a fright. A bit. Unfortunately, these things happen here. What matters is that Sofia's all right. Where's Francesco? He went into town, he didn't want to wake you. His uncle needed help with a piano. Good morning. -Hello, Emma. -Hi. Excuse us, I'll see you later. Hey! Is it still sore? No. What's that? You mustn't touch it! What are you doing? I'm trying to cure it. How? Come. See? It's like it was wounded. It looks like it's crying. That's right. But we can save it. Can you teach me? Of course. Put your hand here. Purify your precious blood to protect you from the spirit that afflicts you. Seal this girl in safety, purify her with your precious blood, seal her in your protection. May the blood protect from the spirit that afflicts you. Seal this girl in safety, purify her with your precious blood, seal her in your protection. What are you doing? Honey, are you OK? -What's this? -It'll help it to heal. It's a natural remedy. I made it, don't worry. -Mom. -Be quiet! -Let me go! -Quiet! You're hurting me! OK, what did she do to you? She wanted to cure me. Like she does with the trees! Don't believe everything you're told! -She's Francesco's mom! -I don't care! They should have asked me. Sofia, wait! What's going on? Your mother was doing something strange to Sofia. -What? -I don't know! They gave her something to drink. It'll be one of her herbal concoctions, I was raised on them. I don't want other people touching her. OK, don't worry. I'll go and speak to her. Did you hurt yourself? Come on. Sorry for before. I didn't want to be angry with you. I was frightened. Are you tired? Yes. Teresa? Did you get lost? I was looking for you. What were you doing to my daughter? You're getting too worked up. I know what I'm doing. People come to me for help. And what do you help them with? This stuff? There are things you can't understand. What? What can't I understand? Tomorrow morning we're going home. Why have you kept this stuff? Mom. FRANCESCO AND ADA ANNOUNCE THEIR WEDDING, 27 JULY 1980 I'm going to bed. Good night. -How's Sofia? -Fine. Sabrina can bring her something to eat. No need, she's already asleep. I'll be right up. Take your time, I'm sleeping with Sofia. Sofia? Sofia, what's wrong? Hey! Hey! Wake up! Sofia! Sofia? What's wrong? She was hurting herself in her sleep. I've never seen her do this. She's hot. Let's get her back into bed. Come on, love, come on. It's got worse. She needs a doctor. Hello, Emma. You needn't have come. A phone call and we'd have come right away. Let's go. The doctor's waiting for us. Has she had nausea, muscle spasms or difficulty breathing? No. Has she ever had any other episodes of sleepwalking? The toxins of tarantulas are weaker than those of bees. They're disposed of by the body in a matter of a few days. The wound is following its natural course. Why is she like this? It could be an allergy, or her immune defenses are a little low. It happens. Her temperature's coming down. She just needs to rest. A simple antipyretic should do it. And these drops to be applied twice a day. OK, Sofia? Tomorrow I'll come to visit you. Thank you, Doctor. Don't worry. Seal her in your protection... May the blood protect from the spirit that afflicts you. May the blood protect from the spirit that afflicts you. Seal this girl in safety, purify her... I want to take her home. Let's wait for the fever to drop. What if she gets worse? Let's wait for the medicines to take effect. I'm not giving that stuff to my daughter. Emma, you're exaggerating. You heard the doctor. Sofia. Sofia, what is it? What is it? Please, keep her away. I don't want Sofia to be upset again. All right. How is she? The doctor said... Mom. I'm here, baby. Help me, please. As soon as you're better, we'll go back home, I promise. -Emma. -What? We need to talk to you. Your daughter isn't simply sick. The medicines won't do anything. What are you saying? She has no defenses any more, Emma. She doesn't even have control of her own body. Listen to her, I beg you. Sofia... has been bound. What? Someone's cursed her. -You two are crazy. -Emma! Wait! You have to trust her. My mother knows what she's doing. You have to trust her. We have to get away from here now! No! Sofia! Sofia! Open the door! -Sofia! -Sofia! Oh, God! What's that? What have you done to her? Answer me! It's her. She's come back. Emma. There's something I never told you. When I was still living here... there was girl who worked for us... Ada. We fell in love. We were kids. And she got pregnant. We were meant to get married, but... At a certain point she fell ill. I asked my mother to help her... to cure her. But there was nothing to be done. She lost the baby. And she... She went mad. She went mad with grief. We tried to calm her down, but... At a certain point, she disappeared. Nobody ever saw her again. What does this have to do with Sofia? When the tarantula bit Sofia, Ada established a binding with her. She only has to complete the bewitchment, then she'll take her. But why? What does she want from her? Because Sofia is like a daughter to Francesco. And that's all that Ada wants. A daughter. -We're telling you the truth. -We only want to protect Sofia. What do we need to do? I know how to sever the binding. But we need to hurry. Nobody's going to hurt her. -Emma! -Emma! Emma, open up! Emma, please! -Open the door! -Listen to me! Come on, Sofia. Please. Fuck! She'll take her. Look what she did to me. Sofia. Sofia! Sofia. Sofia? -Where's Sofia? -I saw her. Where's Sofia? Emma. -Love... -She took her. I saw her. Calm down. Wait. Don't move. I have to find Sofia. Calm down, Emma. Calm down. It's my fault. It's not your fault. Francesco's gone to look for her. Listen to me. At first I didn't understand. It wasn't a simple binding. Ada had been touched by something powerful and evil. Ada? Ada. I'd never seen anything like it. I did everything in my power to save her. That was my duty. But she ran away. And nobody ever managed to find her. But when she felt your presence she reawakened. What happened to her? Ada didn't lose the baby because she was ill. Something happened to her. And Francesco was to blame. When Ada became pregnant... Francesco wasn't ready to be a father. He was just a boy with his whole life in front of him. He tried to get her to change her mind, but... Ada put her foot down, she wanted that child whatever the cost. So then my son... made the biggest mistake of his life. He tried with a ritual. In secret... to make her lose the child. He wanted everything to go back to how it had been, but he didn't know how to do it. He didn't have the skill to call on those forces, to control them. I tried to cure her, but by then it was too late for her. I had a duty to protect my son. The same way I tried to protect Sofia. How can we find her? Is there a way? A unification ritual, but it's very dangerous. The binding with Sofia nourishes Ada. Every moment that passes she becomes more powerful. You could end up bound to her. It doesn't matter. I have to find my daughter. I did all this for us. So you've forgiven me? Ada... It's just the three of us. You just have to understand where they are. Don't confront her for any reason in the world. Two eyes stared at you, mine want to help you. I apply this bound blood to see where she hides. It's the blood of your nature. Francesco! Did you see? Did Ada realize you were there? Yes. We were in a cave. Francesco was with her as well. ...from the spirit that afflicts you. Purify your precious blood... to seal her in your protection. May my blood protect you... from the spirit that afflicts you. Purify your precious blood... to seal her in your protection. Sofia. Sofia. Come on. Sofia. This way. Help me, please. I have to purify the blood before cutting the bite. I have to take her blood and combine it with yours. It's the only way to bind her to you again. May my blood protect you from the spirits that afflict you. May my blood protect you... What's happening? What's happening? Sofia? Sofia, wake up! She can't hear you. Take this. Now I need your blood. Emma, no! Purify your precious blood... to seal her in your protection. May the blood protect... from the spirit that afflicts you. THE BINDING
