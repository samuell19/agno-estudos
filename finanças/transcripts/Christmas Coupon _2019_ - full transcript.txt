( film reel spooling up ) - [Host] All right, let's slow it down for this next dance. All you seniors out there, hold your partners just a little bit closer. - Teacher's coming up. Look. - Do you want to get out of here? - Let's do it. (water flowing) Oh, it's so sweet. Aw, this is so sweet, our song. - That's right.

Now, you need to bring in more students, or I'm gonna have to cancel your class and use that time for an open skate instead. - So, I'll try to get more students. - You see these bleachers, Alison? They're empty. You're not a champion anymore. I'm sorry. (Alison sighs) (bells jingle) - Do you feel that, that's crepitus. It's like sand paper. Listen, I don't know how you're walking, much less playing professional hockey. Lauren, let's try the knee immobilizer or the brace, and see which one is most comfortable for him, okay? - Okay. ("We Wish You a Merry Christmas") - So, when everyone comes in, we're gonna serve them some warm soup and then, I figure we'll take them over to the church, where we have a warming center set up, and they can all stay there for the night. - All right. - I like that idea, that'll work. - Here we are. - Thank you. - Some tomato soup, nice and warm. - Thank you, sir. - There you are. - Absolutely, Merry Christmas. - Thank you for helping our community. - Oh, you're so welcome. Thank you for coming in. - Merry Christmas. - God bless you. I got some tomato soup for you. Original recipe, Merry Christmas, my friend. - [Man] Two days ago. - I haven't had a hot meal in a long time. - [Man] It's been nearly a week since I've had a meal. - God bless you. - [Man] And this is the first that I've been able to digest. - We need to pray. - Let's pray. - Thank you so much for this food. Excuse me, but I'm really hungry. - So, not gonna lie, my tomato soup was a hit tonight. - It was, everyone really seemed to enjoy it. You know, I was just thinking, I really wish mom and dad could've been here to see all this. They would've been so proud. I miss them so much. - I do too, I think about them all the time. But I'm glad that tonight we were able to bring people together, create some happiness. - Absolutely. - I really feel like we kept their legacy going with the diner tonight. - Yeah, absolutely. - I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I never realized I was gonna co-own a diner with this pretty little one right over here, but I'm very happy I got into the business. - [Alison] You guys are so sweet. - Oh, thank you. (rock music) - Everybody, I just wanna say, this guy played hard, fought hard, and he went out strong for the team. - To Ivan and to new adventures. - [All] To Ivan. - Cheers, thank you so much, guys, appreciate it. No, no, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I have a cleaner to do that in the morning. I don't roll my sleeves up to anything like this, all right? I'm a professional hockey player, I make a lot of money, and I hire people to do this. - So, what are you going to do next? (Ivan sighs) - Okay. Did we lose all the advertisement deals, when I got cut from the team? - Yes, we lost them all. - And you can't negotiate with another advertiser? - You cannot play with the bad knee. - If you don't get me another deal, I'm over. I have nothing, this is all that I know. - Ivan, don't worry, I will take care. (gentle music) - Hey, welcome home. Thank you for your service. - Excuse me. - Yeah? - Are you Ivan Hall? - [Ivan] I am. - Would you mind taking a photo with my daughter? - Absolutely. Hey, what's your name? - My name is Jennifer. - Jennifer, I like that name. You wanna take a picture? Okay. We'll do peace signs? - We've had a great Christmas so far, a lot of things happened in Hope Springs since you left, but. - I'd love to hear about that. - Of course, I'll tell you all about it. Let's go. Yeah, but with all the changes, you know. (camera clicks) - [Ivan] Awesome, good job. - Thank you, she's lucky to get a photo with you. - Are you kidding me? I'm the lucky one. Nice to meet you, Jennifer. (gentle music) - Nick! Nick, you'll never believe who I just saw at the bus station. - Let me guess. Ivan Hall. - How did you know that? - [Nick] His sister Victoria told me he's moving to Hope Springs to be near the family. - Well, does Alison know yet? - I don't think so. - Well, should we tell her? (Nick sighs) I mean, with everything he did, I feel like she probably deserves to know. - Christopher, we've got a lot of people to make Christmas special for. Here's the list. Let's get back to work. - Birdhouse, bench, wood toys. I think this is stuff I can help you make. Good old Saint Nick. - Ho, ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. - The area was packed this afternoon. Country singer Drew Williams opened the festival with his new single "The Second Time". We're looking forward to an amazing week with a fantastic lineup. It's sunny here in Nashville, but that won't slow down the Christmas spirit. - Daddy! - Daddy! - Hey, guys. Oh, how are you, guys? I missed you so much. - What are you doing home? I thought you had another week left on your tour! - Well, I talked to my manager, we moved some things around. You didn't think I was gonna spend Christmas without you guys? - Yes. - Yes. - Come here. I missed you, guys. I love you so much. - We missed you too. (mobile phone rings) - Mom. - Thanks. Hey, sweetie. - Hello? - It's time for your ice skating lesson. Why don't you grab your skates, okay? - Hold on one second. - Would you like some coffee? - Aunt Allie, this is for you. - Thank you, sweetheart. - You're welcome. - Hello, this is Alison. - Hey Alison, it's Ken. Listen, I'm afraid today is the day the ice breaks. I've decided to cancel your class and use the time for open skate. - No, Ken, this is my job. These kids, they look forward to this. Please, don't do this. Just give me a few more weeks. - I'm sorry, Alison. I need the time for open skate. (Alison sighs) - Did you see Austin's drawing? - Yeah, he got with me right after you. Hey, girls. You're ready? - Yeah, yeah. - All set? Okay. - [Alison] So, no point in getting ready today. Class was canceled. - Oh. - What do you mean, what's going on? - I'll tell you later. I gotta call Bobby. - All right. Well, I will still do something fun today, okay? We'll figure it out. It'll be a fun holiday break. - Yeah. - All right, go and put your skates away real quick, and we'll go do something else. - Put them in the closet, okay? - All right. - That's weird. - That is really strange. She'll tell us though, it will be fine. - Yeah. - Hey, babe. Are you busy right now? - Yeah, sort of. I got a big deal going down today. - It's kind of important. Can I come by and see you? - Sure. - All right, I'll see you in a little bit. - Ivan? - Mrs. Nixon? - Oh, it's so good to see you. - Hey! How are you? - Oh, I'm great. How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. My knee is a little sore, but as they say, your joints are the first to go as you get older. - Hey, my knees haven't given out. - [Ivan] You, you look great, though! - (chuckles) Thank you. Hey, you want to help me put up some signs for the charity event coming up? We're raising money for the soup kitchen. Gonna be a great, great time. - I'd love to help, yeah. (gentle music) - [Mrs. Nixon] Balloons for the kids and sack races and games. - (sniffles) I'm sorry. - You know what, it's all right. Just give it some time. You're a good man, Ivan. - Thank you, I appreciate it. - [Mrs. Nixon] This was wonderful seeing you. - Good to see you too. - Take care. - Thank you, bye-bye. - Hey, babe. - Hi. You okay? You sounded upset on the phone. - Not really, I had a rough morning. That jerk Ken canceled my classes today. I guess I'm not bringing in enough revenue, and they're gonna use it for open skate now. - I'm sorry, baby, give me one second. Did you say your classes are going good? - No, I just told you that they got canceled. I'm not bringing in enough revenue, he claims. - Okay, Mark. Yes, send me the proposal, I'll get back to you. Thanks, bye. I'm sorry, babe. I mean, you'll figure something out, right? You always do. Or you can find another ice rink to work at. Or maybe it's time you, maybe it's time you hung up the skates, it's not a real job. - A real job? Bobby, this is a real job. One that I'm very passionate about, you know that. - Babe, listen, I got this huge deal going down today. Can we please talk about this later? Thomas, my man. Tell you sealed the deal. Ugh, I love you, okay, I'll see you in a little bit. Bye. - [Lauren] Oh, hey, how did it go? - Hey, well, you know, same old, same old. He was super busy, we didn't really get to talk, so. - [Lauren] Is everything okay with you two? I'm starting to get really worried. (Alison sighs) - Excuse us. - I think we're okay, I think it's just that time of year. He's super busy. I don't know, we'll work through it. He did have an idea, though. What if I got the same job, at just another ice rink? - Hey, guys, what's up bro? How are you, buddy? Good to see you. Hey, favorite niece, how are you, girl? Okay. - Do you remember? - I think so. - Let's try, bam, bam. Ah, how are you? Good, I missed you. Sis, you're not gonna believe who I saw in town today. - Who? - Alison Grant. - Did you talk? - No, but she looked at me. - What kind of look? Was it like a surprised look? Or I never wanna see you again type look? - Well, she walked the other way as soon as she saw me. - So, that was an I never wanna see you again type look. - [Lauren] Like I mentioned before, the Nixon's pond is frozen this time of year. You could teach your lessons there. - [Alison] Oh, I don't know. - I just really don't understand why you're not buying into it. It's the perfect idea for you. - It might be the perfect idea, Lauren, I just don't think it's the perfect idea for me. I mean, maybe Bobby is right, maybe it is time for me to find a new job. Wow, do you remember this ornament? - Yeah, that was the Christmas that mom got us our very first ice skates. - It seriously looks the same as it did the day she gave it to us years ago. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give the Nixons a call. Let's just see if next week they'll let you start teaching there. - I don't have any students, though. - We can sign up, aunt Alison. - Yeah, we can ask our friends at school! - Maybe we can make some flyers that we can hand out on Monday? - Flyers, like a coupon book. We'll call it the Christmas Coupon. It's something special between the girls and I. Every once in a while for holidays they make a coupon book for me that I can redeem. And I can have them do chores for me or make me breakfast. This is a great idea. - Oh, girls, you'd do that for me? You guys are the best twin nieces ever. (gentle music) - [Girls] Would you like to come to our aunt Allie's skating lessons? - [Chloe] Yes! - You want to go skating? - Yeah! - Okay, thank you, ladies. - You're welcome. - What do we have? This should be fun. - Skating lessons. - Oh, okay, good. Okay, great, thank you. - You're welcome. - I really wanna learn how to ice skate. - That's dangerous, and I don't want you doing it. - I'll personally supervise her, make sure that it's safe. - Ivan, don't get involved. Drew, tell him. - I'm gonna let the siblings hash this one out. You guys got this. - Do you remember how fun skating was as kids? It was a blast, you know it. - Please, mom. - Okay, look. It's just a few lessons, there'll be other kids. And it'll be fun. - All right, fine. - Thanks, mom. - Just be careful. - Yes! (gentle music) - [Alison] All right, once you, guys, get to this side, you're gonna turn around and skate back. One foot in front of the other. Good job! (gentle music) All right, everybody, good job on those glides. Keep up the good work! - Hey, you know if you lean forward when you push off, you get better balance and distance. - Well, I'm not teaching them how to be hockey players. I'm teaching them the art of figure skating. - I'm just trying to help them get better balance. I'm not saying you're doing it wrong. - Well, it kinda seems like you are. - Look, I actually brought my skates today, so if you want a demonstration, I'll be happy to help you. - Considering that these parents are paying me to teach their kids a lesson, I'm gonna have to respectfully decline your offer. - Ooh, it's chilly out here today. - Well, the ice does work better when it's frozen. - Why were you interrupting Ms. Alison so much? You weren't being very nice to her. - Well, Ms. Alison and I have a history. It's adult stuff, stuff you don't need to worry about. - Why did you keep telling her how to skate? - She does not know how to teach skate technique properly. - You know, Ms. Alison was a champion figure skater. Maybe her technique is just a little different than yours. - Oh, hers is definitely different to mine. Like I said, she just cannot teach skate technique. - I overheard you talking to mom the other night. You like Ms. Alison, don't you? - That is none of your business, young lady. - Okay, fine, but in case you're interested, I know that Ms. Alison practices at Nixon's pond on Monday evenings. - Is that right? Well, thank you, I'll keep that in mind. - Oh, he drives me insane! We argued for a half an hour today. - Ah, arguments are normal part of life, isn't that right? - True, but half an hour? What was he even doing there? I though he had a knee injury or something, and he was forced into early retirement. - He was. So, his niece Chloe, she's gonna be taking classes there, and I think I'm kinda stuck with him for a while. - Oh, I see. Not to totally pry, but did you guys ever sit down face to face and talked about what happened? - No, and I, I mean, I don't really see the point. You know what he did to me. (bell rings) Hey, chief, how are you? - Hey, Alison. Are those my favorite Christmas cookies? - They are. - Thank you, Allie. - You're welcome. - So, are you and Bobby still coming to the Christmas party this Friday? - [Alison] Yeah, we'll be there, wouldn't miss it. - Good. And Thomas tells me that Ivan's back in town. - Yeah, about that, what are the odds you could arrest him for me? - Well, only if he does something, you know, illegal. - I know. (chuckles) - There's a lot of things that he can end up in cuffs for, but claims of the heart, it's not on the list. - I know. Maybe you could pepper spray him a little bit for me or something? - Well, maybe just a little. - Okay, (laughs) well, merry Christmas to you, it was good seeing you, I'll see you Friday. You're welcome. - See you then. - [Alison] Good job, guys. Keep gliding, guys, good job. Okay, everyone, today we're gonna focus on our balance. - Hey, Al! I'd be happy to show you how it's done. - (sighs) Okay, hotshot. If I let you show them one brief demonstration, will you please promise to be quiet for the rest of the class? - Deal. - [Lauren] Would you like hash browns, potatoes? - Just the omelet, that'll be fine. - Just the omelet, okay. - Thank you. - Excellent. - Hey. - How are you? - Good, how is it going? - Good. I was wondering if you thought about that offer I gave you the other day. - I did, but Bobby, this diner is just not for sale. - Lauren, I gave you an offer for twice that this place is worth. - I know, but Bobby, this diner has been in my family for so long. No amount of money can buy the memories or the value we have here. - Well, just keep it in mind, because there's a lot of money in it for you, guys. - [Lauren] I know, I'll think about it again, if need be. - Okay, is Allie here? - No, she just stepped out, actually. She's teaching today. - Teaching where, I thought her class got canceled at the rink? - [Lauren] At the rink they did, but now she's teaching on her own at the Nixon's pond. I think she'll be back in about an hour. - Really? Okay, thanks, Lauren. - Yeah, take care. And what can I get for you today? - Corned beef hash. - Corned beef hash. Excellent. Would you like french fries with that? (gentle guitar music) - [Ivan] Guys, we're gonna lean forward a little bit, not too much. Got it? Understand? - Isn't that nice. So, wait, you start a new class and teaching but now you can't even tell me? - What are you doing here? - Well, Lauren said you'd be down here, so I figured I'd come say hi to my girlfriend. - Well, I did start a new class, but he's not really a part of it. - Yeah, man, I came out with me niece. Figured I'd help out with class a bit today. - Yeah, I think Allie does just fine by herself. She doesn't need your help. - Ivan Hall. - I'm Bobby, Allie's boyfriend. - Okay. - [Alison] All right, everyone, that's it for today. Keep practicing those moves, and I'll see you next time. (gentle music) - So, this Ivan guy. How do you know him? - He's Chloe's uncle. - Really, Alison, how do you know this guy? - If you really want to know the details, we pretty know each other our whole lives. We started dating in eighth grade, and we planned to go to college together, we planned our futures together, and then he got drafted into the NHL. And he didn't tell me about it, and he just left this note for me at the diner. And I haven't heard or seen him 10 years. - You never thought to tell me about him? - Does it really matter, Bobby? I mean, we're together now. - Okay. Let's go. - Aunt Allie! - Girls! Oh, how are my favorite girls? - Good. - Good. - Hi, girls. - Girls! - They really don't like me, do they? - They do, they're just little divas. - I gotta take this. - You gotta go. - See you at the party? - Sounds good. (gentle music) - Hi, how are you? - Hi grandma. - Aw. How are you, hi, sweetie. - So how's business going, Bobby? - Well, we own about 15% of downtown right now. But it could be doing a lot better, if you ask me. - Why? - We're overpaying for everything. I mean, people in this town, they don't look at their companies as businesses. They're looking at it as legacies. - So why do it? Why buy them up? - I need them. If I buy all this property downtown, I can tear it all down, put up one big box-store, and a national chain would eat it right up. If I can get them to come to town, I'd make an absolute killing. - There you go. - Cheers to that. (door bell rings) - Hello, Ivan. - Mrs. Holmes. - So good to see you. - Thank you, good to see you too. - I'm glad that you could join us tonight. And you are still too skinny. Come on in and get something to eat. - Thank you, I will say, I have missed mama home's cooking. - [Mrs. Holmes] Aw, well, don't be shy. - What is he doing here? - Mom invited him. - What was she thinking? Bobby is going to flip, when he sees him here. - Don't blame me, mom invited him. I mean, you know we go way back. - Thank you. - Ivan's here! (chattering) (gentle music) May I have everyone's attention, please? Now that we've finished dinner, it's time for our white elephant gift exchange. - I was, was I supposed to bring a gift to this? - Ah, don't worry about it, I got a gift for you and me to trade. - You did? - Yeah. - Seriously, thank you, I appreciate that. - Oh, stop, they're cheap. - [Alison] Guys, you saw them? Our favorite room. - [Lauren] All right, Bobby, it's your turn next. Are you gonna steel one, or you're gonna grab one from under the tree? - Bobby, how about a snow globe? - Mrs. Holmes, the snow globe is very tempting, thank you, but I think that I'd rather have Ivan's mini tool kit. - Okay, it's all yours. - Ivan, now you get to chose another gift, since yours was taken. - That looks like a little bit more fitting gift for Ivan, don't you think? (Alison chuckles) - Actually, I think my sister would love these. I'm glad I can get them for her. (gentle music) - I don't think we can afford to hire another waitress this Christmas season, with the expenses to fix this roof and everything else, we're barely making it. - Does that mean I cook, and you serve? - It's what's gonna have to mean until we can up the revenue and hire more staff. - (sighs) It's gonna be impossible for us to keep up with the Christmas crowds. Should we, should we consider selling this place? I mean, Bobby did make us a good offer. - Hmm, I don't trust him. I don't like it. - Lauren, Bobby could be your new brother in law. If he marries Alison, we're all gonna be family. - I really, really don't want to do business with him. This diner is in our family. Sweetie, it's not for sale. - Okay, then, somehow we'll make it all work out. - [Lauren] Yeah. (gentle music) Ivan, what a surprise, good to see you here today. - [Ivan] Hey, Lauren, how are you? - Good, how are you? - I'm doing very well, thank you. I just wanna say, please tell your family thanks so much for the invitation. I had so much fun, and it was awesome seeing everyone again. - Oh, well, it was great to see you too. I'm glad you could come! Now, what can I get you here today? - Well, I heard on the street that this classic burger is very good. So, you know what, I think I'm gonna have one of those. - Rumor is correct, I will have that right up for you. - Thanks so much. - Yeah. - That's a good choice. - Well, good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. And Merry Christmas to you, son. - Yeah, I don't really get into Christmas too much, but I do appreciate that, thank you. - So you don't really care for Christmas? - I don't, I don't. - Hmm. It's hard to believe, Ivan. (Ivan sighs) You know, everybody in this town just loves Christmas. - Yeah, I know. So tell me, what do you do nowadays around here? - I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. - Which is now a career profession, right? - Well, actually, I'm a master carpenter. - Is that right? You remember my dad, right? He was a builder. - I do remember him, great guy, wonderful man. - Yeah. - You know, you could come by my shop today, if you'd like. - Well, I don't really have too much going on nowadays, so sure, I think I can do that. - Good, today it is. - Okay. - Good. (Ivan laughs) (gentle music) - [Nick] This is the shop. Welcome, Ivan, this is the shop. - Wow. Did you make this? - Yeah, sure did. - Wait a minute. Is this a Purple Heart? - Yeah. - It's amazing. You mind if I asked what happened? - I just happened to do the right thing at the right time. - Come on, Nick, I know there's more to the story. You're a hero. - Well, it's a good, old, long story. We'll talk about it some time. - Okay. What is this? - Oh, some gifts for children. - Wait a minute, you're the secret Santa, aren't you? - Shh, it's a secret. It's not an elected office. - Can I ask you something? Why do you do it? - Tell me, Ivan, are you good at running? - Of course not, I'm a skater. I'm a hockey player. - I used to be good at running once. Running from difficult situations, that is. - What do you mean? - The world has its share of challenges. Difficult or seemingly impossible situations confront people every day. If they have hope, then they can summon the courage to face their fears. This is what I'm trying to give them, the gift of hope. - Hope. - Hope. Now, would you like to help me build this piano bench? - Yeah. - [Nick] Good, good, I'll take your coat. - Thank you. - All right, here. - Thank you. (gentle music) (rooster crowing) (gentle piano music) That was amazing! I can see why you were a champion figure skater. - [Alison] And? - And what? - Look, if you came here to gloat, just do it already. - I didn't come here to gloat. You know, you're actually a really good teacher, Al. You've always been good with kids, you got a big heart, very helpful. - Thank you. (gentle guitar music) (Bobby sighs) (gentle piano music) - Unbelievable. Allie, what? What is this? - [Alison] Bobby, this isn't what it looks like. I was here practicing, and Ivan showed up and... - What? You forget you have a boyfriend, all of a sudden? - Look, man, like she said, totally innocent, my fault. - Dude, mind your own business. Okay, this is between Allie and I. - Look, I don't wanna get in the middle of anything, I'll take off, I'll see you tomorrow. - [Bobby] No, you're not gonna see her tomorrow. You're not gonna see her anymore. Okay, stay away from her. - Look, Bobby, that's enough. Ivan's just a friend. - You heard her, man. We're just friends, that's it. - No, you're not friends! Okay, you're nothing anymore, okay? You understand me? - Ivan, you better leave. - [Bobby] Yeah, I think that's a good idea. - Bobby, what is your problem? He was just here ice skating, it's not a big deal. - Yes, it is a big deal, Allie! It's a big deal to me, okay? Stay away from him. - You know, maybe we should just take a break. - Take a break? Fine. Mark my words, Alison Grant, you're gonna regret this. I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. (gentle music) (knock on the door) - Hey, Pastor Chris. Can I talk to you for a sec? - [Chris] Please, come on in. - [Alison] How are you? - Oh, we're doing pretty well preparing for Sunday. How are you? - Well, I came to talk to you about Ivan. - Well, I don't think Ivan is a book in the Bible, but I may have an opinion or two I could share. - Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's just, ever since he's been back in town, I have these feelings, and I just don't know how to process them. - (sighs) Well, we were all good friends growing up. We all did things together, and I know it was really hard on you, when he left. - Yeah, I mean, him being around, and I don't know, I mean, did he ever say anything to you about, like years ago, when he left that note for me? Or how he left it? - No, he didn't. - [Alison] I was just wondering. - But he did talk to me about it a few days ago. - He did? What did he say? - I think that's something you need to talk to Ivan about. - Did he even say he was sorry for what he did to me? And how he left me, and how he left me that note? - Alison, he did something that was wrong. But you have an opportunity to choose forgiveness. Because forgiveness can only be given by the one to whom the wrong was done. Anything that's manipulated or earned or deserved isn't really forgiveness. This is ultimately your choice to make. I don't wanna try to make that decision for you. I really think you need to talk to him. - Yeah, well, I'm glad we had this talk. Thanks, Chris. - Hey, you stay warm out there now. - [Alison] Thank you, have a good day. - [Chris] Be careful, you too. - You broke up with him, just like that? - Yeah, I mean, he was being such a jerk. I don't know who he is anymore. - Hmm. So, tell me, what's going on with you and Ivan? - I don't know. I think I might be starting to have feelings for him again. - Again? - I don't know. - Or, maybe they just never went away in the first place. I mean, I've seen you two together. You have something special, it's like magic. - Yeah, I mean, but how do I know he's not gonna hurt me again? - Hmm, well, here's what I think you should do. Spend a little time with him. That way you know for sure one way or the other. - Yeah, I think you're right. (gentle music) - [Ivan] Well, good morning. I see you're still running your same old route. - [Alison] Sure I am. Are you sure you should be running on that knee of yours? - I'm fine, this knee, as a matter of fact, I bet I could beat you in a race right now. - Huh, all right hotshot, you think you're such a great athlete? Meet me tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m. at the rec center. - What happens at the rec center? - [Alison] 10:00 a.m. Don't be late! - What happens at 10:00 a.m.? - [Instructor] Relaxing your toes. Relaxing your face. Finding your breath. - Hey, this isn't so bad. - Shh. - Moving in right into tree pose. Finding our breath. Finding our balance. (thud) (Ivan grunts) - [Alison] Are you okay? - I got my bad knee. - [Alison] Okay, let's try to get out of here. Get up. (Ivan grunting) - [Instructor] Looking back toward your elbow. Nice breath. All right, take our palms to the floor, step back. - How's it feeling? - It's sore. - Here, try this. Lay back. Seriously, listen to me, I know what I'm talking about. - All right, well, if you think it'll help, doc. - It will. - You know what, I'm fine. I need to leave. (grunts) - See? Would you listen to me, please? Lay back. You need to keep the ice on it right now. Tell you what, twins and I we're gonna make some Christmas cookies. Stick around and eat them with us. By then, you should be fine and good to go. Sounds good? - Fine. - Thank you. (cheerful music) - Wanna help? - That's a good idea, yeah. - All right. - [Girl] No, I'm gonna fix these! - [Ivan] Three. Look, that's okay. It looks like I'm painting. Okay, now that we made them, now we got to eat them. - Yeah, we do. - I'm taking this one. That's one my favorite. - [Girl] They look too good to have. - Mm, so good. - Mine tastes so good right now. - Did you make this one? - What do you think? - Yummy! - Yummy! - Whole life right now. - Oh, okay, then. (gentle music) - [Alex] Someone's trying to make it look like you made a mistake. The evidence is gonna be on your computer. - Listen, Alex, I really like you, but I've only known you for a short time. - [Alex] I really like you too.

You, guys, wanna go see Santa Claus? - [All] Yeah! (bells jingle) - [Ivan] Go see Santa Claus? What is it with this town and Christmas? - [Alison] Oh, come on, stop being the Grinch. Everyone in Hope Springs celebrates Christmas. ("We Wish You a Merry Christmas") - Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas! - [All] Merry Christmas. - Santa, I just wanted to say that I'm thankful for everything I already own. But, if I could have horseback riding lessons, I would like that too. - So you ride horses, do you? Oh, good, I'll work on that. And what would you like Santa to bring you? - A truck. - A truck? Okay, good, good. And girls, what would you like for Christmas? - We would like white ice skates with pink laces. - You would, would you? The both of you, right? Good, good. - A Christmas charity event. I don't know about that, Al. - You probably never volunteered at Christmas time before, right? It's actually really special. And honestly, we might get a lot more people, if they know a hockey star is coming. - I don't know, I'm just not good at this Christmas thing, okay? - You know, Ivan, ever since your dad died, you've never been the same with Christmas. What happened? - Do you really wanna know? - Yeah. - Okay. That last winter in high school. My family and I were taking a trip up to see my grandparents at the cabin. We ran into a blizzard. My dad hit an ice patch. The car span in circles, and the driver's side smashed into a tree. In the ICU I watched my own father die on Christmas day. And ever since then, we just never celebrated Christmas since. - Ivan, I'm so sorry. Is that why you never came back? - Yeah. (sniffles) Well, we came out this way for a tree, let's get one, huh? - This one? - Yeah. - Who wants Santa Claus? - Here, get this one. - You wanna help, buddy? - [Ivan] Is that okay? - How about an ice skate, aunt Allie's favorite. - [Ivan] Am I doing this right? (gentle music) - You know, decorating a Christmas tree is one of my favorite parts of Christmas. - [Austin] It's mine too. - It is? - I love it. - Of course it is. - Do you wanna go up? Whoa! Right up there. - Good job, everybody. - There you go. - So, everyone, if you could please hand out these invitations for the Nixon's farm charity event next week, that would be really helpful. This is to keep the soup kitchen open all winter long. Please feel free to post the flyers anywhere you can find to post them. And let's get to work. Bobby, what are you doing here? - You're always doing this kind of stuff. I kinda thought I might give it a try for once. - Okay, well the bed sheets in the warming center need to be changed, do you wanna do that? - Do you think maybe you and I could work together and show me the ropes a little bit? - Sure, I'm passing out flyers right now, if you want to help with that. - I can do that, yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. (gentle guitar music) - [Ivan] So, what do you think? After we're done here, let's grab some coffee. - Coffee or like a real date? - We could call it a real date. - Well, if we're gonna go on a real date, I wanna go out with DI Paul. - Well, I'm just what you got, so, okay, you got it. - [Alison] Okay, where are we? - [Ivan] A few more steps, and I'll take the blindfold off. - [Alison] All right. - [Ivan] And. - [Alison] Oh my goodness. (Ivan laughs) Are we going on that? - [Ivan] Follow me. (gentle music) (plane engine roars) - Your food will be ready momentarily. - Thank you. - Please enjoy some music. - Thank you.

I see you, guys, on TV! - What about me? - I know you, I know you. - Nice to meet you. - I've known this guy since high school. - Oh yeah? - We go way back. - That's awesome. - Well, I've got to head out. - All right, hey, nice seeing you, man, take care. - Fellas! - My brother! What is up, dude? - What is up? - Hey, it's great seeing you, man. You're up on your feet! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yes, off that knee, dude. Getting better, you look great. - It's just a little sore here and there, but we're doing better. We're doing better. - Excellent, happy about that. - All right. - Yeah. - Yeah? What are you doing? Hi. (gentle music) - Thank you so much again for letting us use the facility. - It is our pleasure. This is gonna be a great venue. - I know, I feel like it's going really well. - Guess who? - Oh my goodness. - Surprise! - You guys! What are you doing here? - It's Christmas, so we're back for break. - That's right, that's right. - Thank you. - All right. - Have some fun. - Hey, man. - What's up, how are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Doing well, thank you, what's your name? - I'm Caleb. - Caleb. - So you play? - [Caleb] Yeah, I play cool. - Really? - Yeah. - Hey, who's your favorite player? - Those are some tough players out there. - Yeah. - Yes. - That's right, man. - Can you sign this too? - Of course, of course. - So I heard you got kicked out of the league. - Well, actually, I got a knee injury. - How's it going? - It's fine. - Hey, Bobby, why don't we go over here? You can help me with the potato sack race. All right, everybody. Now we're gonna do a potato sack race. Please put your money and your name in a jar of the person that you think might win, and when we're all done, you guys can win some of Mrs. Nixon's delicious Christmas cookies. Ready? On your marks, get set, go! (people cheering) All right, guys, looks like we have a winner. Bobby. (people applauding) And anybody that put their name and their money in Bobby's jar can line up with Mrs. Nixon over here and get some of her delicious Christmas cookies. - Thank you. So, anybody who put their tickets in my jar, enjoy all the cookies you want and to this lovely lady. - Oh, guys, all right. Well, thanks, everybody. Continue on and have a great day. - Bobby, what was that? - Allie, I've been, I've been thinking about everything a lot. Especially everything you said to me at the pond that day. And, I realized you're right. You were right about everything. And that was, kinda hoping you'd give me a second chance. - Oh, Bobby, I don't know, with everything that's happened. - Allie, please. Like, I should've done this so much sooner. And it was really wrong of me to take this long, but I want to ask you to be my wife. - Bobby, this is so unexpected, I don't know what to say. - Listen, you don't have to say anything. Look, you don't have to make a decision right now. Just wear it and think about it. Let me know. - It's beautiful. I'll think about it. - Allie, I'm sorry. About everything. - [Alison] Thank you, that means a lot to me, Bobby. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Sis, what are you doing here? - I'm here to help. - She's really getting into the Christmas spirit, I guess. - You do know this is a Christmas thing, right? - I have a lot of Christmas things to catch up on. (gentle music) - [Ivan] Hello, this is Ivan. - Ivan. Guess what? - Yeah. - A coaching opportunity just opened up. This position comes with many benefits. (dramatic music) Ivan, are you listening to me? - Yeah, I'm sorry, what did you say? - The team needs a coach, this is serious. - Really? - But I need an answer now. - Right, well, can I at least have a few days to think about it? - Okay. (people chattering) - Ivan, I'm really busy right now. Can we please talk later? - Excuse me? - Yes? - What are your vegan options? - You can find those on the back of the menu right there, sir. - Okay, thank you so much. - No problem. Ivan, I'm serious, I'm way too busy to deal with this right now. - I've just got a new opportunity in the lead. I start tomorrow. - Yeah, I heard. No note this time? - Come on, don't do this. Don't marry this guy, you know it's not right. You know it's always been you and me. - Has it always been you and me? Or has it always been you and hockey? And as for Bobby, he's doing everything he can to save this town, and he actually loves me. - Does he, really? Come on, just please, just come with me. - Ivan, I belong here in Hope Springs. And obviously, you're too good for us. So, I don't know. Maybe we're just not meant to be. - Yeah, Kumar, what's up, it's Ivan. I thought about your offer. I wanna let you know I'm in. - Great. I will see you tomorrow. - [Ivan] Sounds good. - Bye. Yes! - I gotta go. - Please don't go uncle Ivy, you and Ms. Alison still need to work things out. - Alison's gonna marry someone else, okay? There's nothing I can do about it. I gotta go. - But, she doesn't even like him. And he's not a very nice person. - Chloe, these are issues for adults, okay? Don't worry about it. - But, I'm gonna miss you so much, uncle Ivy. I love you. - I'll tell you what. Once I get moved in, I'll bring you out to visit, all right? I love you, kid. It's gonna be all right, I promise. Okay? Okay? (dramatic music) - [Thomas] We didn't raise enough money to keep the soup kitchen open. - Even with the charity event? - No. - We worked so hard to make it a success. - I just don't understand, I thought for sure that we would have enough. - We did our best. (gentle piano music) - All right, guys, let's practice those glides. One foot in front of the other. Good job! (gentle music) Good job, one foot in front of the other. (dramatic music) (Ivan sighs) (gentle piano music) - I'd like to make a toast to this wonderful man and father, sitting at the end of the table over here. Dad, we are all so proud of you. You kept this town safe. Here's to the best police chief Hope Springs has ever had. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Honey, we're so proud of you. - Thank you, Thomas. And thank all of you. Thank you, everybody for coming out to join me tonight to celebrate with me on 30 years on the police department. It's been, frankly, an amazing ride. But, it's time to pass the baton to Mike. And he's gonna do a great job keeping an eye on all you guys. (all chuckle) And Thomas, I wanted to share that, you know, I've missed a lot of birthday parties, a lot of ball games. It was my job. It was just what I had to do. But now, I get to be everywhere, because it's what I always wanted to do. And I also have to admit that I couldn't have done any of this without the love and support of this amazing woman by my side. - Thank you. - Aw. - And speaking of amazing women, I'd like to say something about this amazing woman right here. Alison and I have decided to take our journey together a step further. So, cheers, chief, congratulations. And cheers to the future Ms. Bobby Harrison. (all applauding) - What do you think? - [Lauren] Wow, you look awesome! - Do you like it or do you love it? - I mean, I like it. I just don't know if it's the one, you know. - Let's try on a ball gown. - Okay. What do you guys think? - I think you look stunning. - Yeah? - Yeah. - So, are you really going through with this? - [Alison] Looks like it. - So, your ex Ivan Hall is available? - Yeah, girl, I'm engaged. - You probably don't need those, right? - No. - Well, for someone who just got engaged, I'm not too sure how happy you look about it. - I mean, I'm happy, I'm excited. It just was really fast. - Mm-hmm, well, congratulations then. - Thank you. Oh, that's beautiful. - What do we think? - I love that one. - I'm excited. - All right. - Hey, Chloe, it's your uncle Ivan. Can you put your mom on the phone, please? - Uncle Ivy, you have to come back here. Things are going really bad. - What is bad news? - Well, Ms. Alison is officially engaged. And the soup kitchen is closing. - I am so sorry to hear that. - So you're not gonna do anything about it? - Chloe, we have already talked about this. It's not gonna happen. Just please, put your mom on the phone. - [Chloe] Okay, fine. - So, the sanctuary can usually be decorated. Some couples like to put flowers over here and flowers over here. But whatever you'd like to do, we can accommodate. - Okay, that sounds really nice. What do you think, babe? - Yeah, that's fine, that'll work. - Now, do you have a date set? - [Alison] We're kinda working on that right now. - When we get one, we'll let you know, all right? - Okay. - Let's go. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - Fancy church, Allie. - But that's what I wanted, Bobby. - Is it? - Yes. - Okay, well, sorry. I'll make enough money, we can get whatever you want. Just... (phone rings) - Hope Springs church, Pastor Chris speaking. - [Ivan] Hey, man, it's Ivan. - Hey, Ivan, buddy, how's it going? How's coaching? - (chuckles) Well, I haven't started yet, but I'll definitely let you know when I do, all right? - Okay, well, when you do, I will be watching for you on TV, when I watch the games. - Hey, Chris. So, I hear that you won't be able to keep the soup kitchen open for the winter. Is that right? - (sighs) Unfortunately, that is correct. We're just running low on funds for it, and we're gonna have to shut it down. - How much money do you need? - I wish uncle Ivan and Ms. Alison were still dating. - Me too. - Maybe we could ask Santa at the Christmas tree farm? We could tell him that all we want for Christmas is for uncle Ivan and Ms. Alison to be back together again. - That's a good idea! - [Alison] What are you three girls talking about over here? - It's nothing. We're just talking about what we want for Christmas. - Okay, well, have fun skating, girls. - That was close. (giggling) (gentle music) - You girls are back again. - We all changed our minds on what we want for Christmas. - You have, have you? And what would you most wish for this Christmas? - We want uncle Ivan and Alison to be happy. We want them to fall in love. Do you think you could help with that happen? - Well, that's a very difficult wish, you see. Hmm. That's a wish for those who choose to love each other. Only they can give that gift to each other. Well, I'll see what I can do, but Santa can't make any big promises. Okay? - 2,000 years ago, maybe even at this time of year, angles were singing over Bethlehem, "Do not be afraid, I bring you good tidings of great joy "which will be to all people. "For unto you is born this day in the city of David "a savior who is Christ the Lord." That night hope for our world was born, and that hope only continues to grow. Well, next Sunday is Christmas eve, we're gonna have a special treat. We're gonna watch our youth perform the Christmas pageant on ice at the Nixon farm. I hope to see you all there. Merry Christmas, go in peace. You're dismissed. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, pastor. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Well, I also have some good news. A generous donor has decided to fund the soup kitchen through the end of the year. - Really? A generous donor, huh? - Well, the donor was from out of town, but the check cash and the funds transferred. - That's awesome! - Let's go. Merry Christmas. - Okay, merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - All right. Got a flight to Montreal tonight. And in the morning we start preseason. Gotta get those boys winning. - Perfect, you will do great. - Yeah. I work. - Is everything okay? - (sighs) Yeah, I'm fine. (sighs) What do you mean? - You were obvious missing something, but when you went back home, you found it. - So, are you saying you want me to give up this huge coaching opportunity to move back to Hope Springs? - Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. - You're crazy. Come here. (mobile phone chimes) My ride's here. I have to go. - Ivan, you can still change your mind. (melancholy music) - So, going over the offer again. What do you think? - No, we've decided against it. - Guys, come on, this is a good deal. - Bobby, what is this I hear about you selling to a big box-store? - Hi, Allie. Yes, I am. - Oh. - Okay? Hope Springs is in desperate need of modernization, and I'm gonna give it to them. - You told all those people that their businesses would stay open. How could you do that to them? - Well, if I told everyone, nobody would sell, okay? And this is gonna be good for everyone. - [Alison] No, this is gonna be good for you. - For us. - You know, you never pay attention to me. And your business is way more important than anything. And you lie to everybody! I just can't be with somebody like that. There is no us. - Allie, what are you doing? Allie! Come on! (gentle piano music) - I think you should leave now, Bobby. - Yeah, yeah. Right away. You, guys, are making a big mistake. - I really don't think so. (gentle piano music) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final boarding call for flight 1772 to Montreal. All ticketed and confirmed passengers must be onboard the flight at this time. - [Alison] Hey, sis. Can I ask you a favor? - Yeah. Oh, you're gonna go see Ivan, aren't you? - You wanna be my ride? - [Lauren] Yeah, let's do it. - So, the bus leaves in about an hour, so I could really use your help packing. - Yeah, we'll make time, let's do it right now. (gentle guitar music) - Oh, hey, Pastor Chris, what are you doing here? - (sighs) Oh, I'm just here to pick someone up. What brings you here? - Well, I just thought I'll take a quick trip, clear my head a little bit. So. - Of course. (gentle piano music) Well, Allie, you have a very Merry Christmas and have a good trip. - Thanks, you too. By the way, who are you picking up? - Al, I'm so sorry, I... (dramatic music) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Leaving you was the biggest mistake I ever made. This should have never happened. - Ivan, I'll be waiting in my truck around the corner, whenever you're ready. (both laughing) ("Silent Night") (all chattering) - Is that like a dumbbell water bottle? - Yes. - So you can lift and drink at the same time, right? - Yes, nice. - Ooh, that looks big, that looks heavy. - Wow, it is! - Where do you think you're going? (paper rustling) - [All] Aw, girls. - Oh my goodness! - Oh, those are so beautiful. - Aw. - Alison Grant, will you be my wife? - Oh my goodness. - Okay? - Yes. Mm, yes. - Let's try this thing on. - It's beautiful. - Let's go tell the family. - Hey, we have an announcement to make. - Oh, no! (all cheering) I'm so happy! Yeah! (dramatic music) - Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not boast, it is not proud. It is not self-seeking, it does not dishonor others, keeps no record of wrong. Now, for the vows. Do you promise to love and to keep, to hold each other till you're fast asleep? To have and to hold in sickness and in health whether you're young or old, in lack or in wealth? Do you promise to love each other with this wedding vow, to commit to each other in this moment right now? Do you? - I do. - Do you? - I do. - Good. Then, by the power vested in me, for the rest of your life, I pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (all cheering) (dramatic music) - Thank you. - Thank you. - So, how do you know Ivan? - I'm his agent. - So, you're responsible for taking him away from us? - Yes, I did. I got him a good job. But I also brought him back here. - (chuckles) Yes, you did. Well, cheers to that. - Look how happy he is. - Yes. - Hey, wanna get out of here? - Let's do it. - I know a place. - To Ivan and Allie. - Have you seen him? - No. - Huh. - I think they're gone. (chuckles) Oh, well. Cheers. - [Alison] Oh my goodness. (Ivan laughs) - Wait. - Aw, you remembered! - Yes, I remembered.
