RADIO HOST (VOICEOVER): Good morning, San Luis Obispo. It's 6 AM on this fine Wednesday morning. And we're here at Radio-- [RADIO CLICKS OFF] [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Glad you could make it. ALVIN: Earl, can I see you a minute? EARL: Later, Blake. How long will it take you? -Quick as I get dressed. EARL: All right. Let's get going. Help him get dressed. -Let me give you a hand with that. -Hey, thanks. -We're still waiting, gentlemen. MAN: All cameras standby. -Let's do it. -Good luck. -Thank you. -Good luck, man. MAN: Crazy son of a bitch. EARL: Mark it up. -Hey! [INAUDIBLE] -All right. This is a big one [INAUDIBLE]. Let's get it right. MAN: Come on, speed it up. WOMAN: Hi, Judy. MAN: Billy, we're ready to go. -OK. Paul, let's go over it one more time. You're going to [INAUDIBLE] me at 20 and 25, right? -All right. Soon as I get it lined out, I'm going to give you the high sign. And you go ahead and make the move. -OK. Let's make it a good one, huh? EARL (ON WALKIE TALKIE): Greg, this is Earl. Are you ready? We're standing by. -All right, Earl. We're ready. -OK. Cameras ready. -Standing by. -Do we have speed? CAMERAMAN: Speed. Cameras rolling. EARL: Action! [INAUDIBLE] [TIRES SQUEALING] HELICOPTER PILOT: The car is lined up. EARL: It's a go. No abort. HELICOPTER PILOT: [INAUDIBLE] the car. MAN: Cancel. HELICOPTER PILOT: I'm closing on him. Easy. I got him. -He's made the connect. HELICOPTER PILOT: Climbing to 1500. He's [INAUDIBLE] the hook now. -[INAUDIBLE]. CAMERAMAN: Camera two, coming in. -Hey! HELICOPTER PILOT: What's wrong, Greg? GREG: The hook is jammed! I can't close it! Get me down! -Bring him down. Do you copy? HELICOPTER PILOT: Roger. [INAUDIBLE]. -My arm! MAN: Take her down faster, damn it. -Bring him down! Bring him down! -Damn it! MAN: [INAUDIBLE]. -Jack, will you listen to me for a second, please? I know we're a week behind schedule. -What is the big deal here? We've got a simple chase picture. SWAT teams, car chases, lots of violence. -Jack, will you listen to me for a second? -That Daddy? -Now, look. Look, Blake. Don't get me wrong. Now, we're all still with you. -Jack, look. I got to get these stunts, or I don't have a picture. I mean, I got an action film where a stuntman really dies. People are going to pay to see that. -You know, I hope for your sake you're right, Blake. Don't forget. You got those four big scenes to shoot in five days. -Now, listen. Listen. I'm going to stay as close to budget as I can. I'm going to keep this thing under control and bring it in for you. Now, trust me. -It's your ass, Blake. Oh, and kiss Judy for me. -You're beautiful. You're beautiful. I'll talk to you later. -What did you mean when you said, without stunts you don't have a picture? I mean, what do I look like, a head-on collision? -I'm just trying to buy time for you, honey. I mean, a few extra scenes aren't going to hurt you. -Well, why didn't you just tell Daddy that? -Because Daddy had a room full of executives, and executives know from stunts. They don't know from talent. Understand? MECHANIC: Damn foreign cars. -How long is it going to take you to fix it? -Oh, four, five hours. I have to go get the parts. -OK. Go ahead. -All right. -Hey, buddy. You get a second, you want to jump on those windshields. -Sure. -Excuse me. Are you going to San Luis Obispo? -Yeah. -Could I get a ride? I'm willing to pay you? -Pay me? How much? -$5, $10? I don't know. -I'd take $30. -$30? I can get a taxi for $30. -Well, in the world I live in, lady, if you can't fix it, you don't drive it. -Chauvinist. -What do you want me to do with the car? -Uh, when you're finished with it, can you drop it off at the Madonna Inn. -Sure. -You can just toss those any place in back. -$30 for a goddamn truck. EARL: And cut! -Is that a print? MAN: [INAUDIBLE] please. MAN: 166. -Can you fellas live with that gag? MAN: Sounds OK. -Yeah, it was fine. -Well, I can't. We'll do it again. Pete, Chuck, come on back here. MAN: First position. MAN: [INAUDIBLE]. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] reloading. -You dazzle me. You fellas really dazzle me. But it didn't work. The damn thing didn't work. We need a better impact, bigger jerk. [INAUDIBLE] -Hey, I'll tell you whether I need a bigger jerk or not. -Chuck, anytime you don't want to do a stunt, all you've got to do is let me know. -I just don't want Pete here trying to kill me, is all. EARL: Listen, if it'll make the stunt work, I'm interested. -You're the director. What the hell is this thing? -Nitrogen wrench. -Oh yeah? Has anybody tested it yet? -I heard about that. Yeah. It's safe as a cradle. Don't worry. -Yeah. But it's not as soft, so it's going to cost you another $50. Because I'm in this for the money, not the pain. -How come you're in such a hurry to get to San Luis? -They're shooting a movie up there-- doing some big action sequences. I'm a writer. I'm doing an article on stuntmen. -For who? -Oh, something called "Action Magazine." -Say something you wrote that I might have read. -Well, most of the time I write for literary quarterlies and psychology magazines-- New York stuff. I doubt if you'd have read it. -How'd you get this job? -Well, the idea is that stuntmen, basically they're very boring people apart from their work. I'd like to really get into the psychological attitude behind the work. -I don't get you. -Well, for instance, on this movie, there was a stuntman, a guy called Greg Wilson, who got killed a few days ago. Well, that's good maybe for a few paragraphs. But why he did it-- you know, the recklessness behind doing a stunt like that-- that's a good story. -That's a real interesting slant you got on things, lady. -You really think so? -No, I don't look. But then, I'm a stuntman. And that vain, reckless boor you described as having gotten killed-- that was my brother. MAN: Get him hooked up. MAN: Couldn't pay me to do this. MAN: Lace him up tight, there. Moving back to one. MAN: Watch your back, please. MAN: That ought to hold anything. MAN: Easy, easy. MAN: Wait'll you feel 500 pounds tugging at you. -Action! [POLICE SIREN] [GUNSHOTS] EARL: Pete, stand by! And-- [INAUDIBLE]. -Jesus christ! Are you out of your goddamn mind? EARL: And cut! -[INAUDIBLE]. -It was worth at least $100 in pain. -Brilliant, Pete. Brilliant. Spectacular, Paul. Spectacular. Thank you very much. -Spectacular, huh? Yes. -Spectacular. MAN: Hey, come on! Hey! -What's the matter with you? Are you crazy or something? -He's the one who's crazy. He doesn't give a goddamn about any of us. All he gives a damn about is his goddamn special defects. -You all right? You look good. Don't worry about it. The girls are going to love you. -Whoa! Hey, you stupid son of a bitch, man. Where'd you get your license at, McDonald's? [LAUGHING] -Wally. -Hey. Hey, look who's here. It's Mr. Cool! -Take it easy, writer lady. -Hey, Glen. How are you? -Hello, Red. How you doing? -Fussing and fighting. -Glad you're here, Glen. -What happened? -What can we say? He was one of us. A brother. -Nobody can do that stunt, Glen. It's too tough. -Bullshit, baby. That's just a difference of opinion. -Hey, buddy. I was driving the car. And he couldn't do the stunt because he couldn't make the hookup. -If he couldn't have done the stunt, Paul, he wouldn't have tried it. The dicey part's not the hookup, anyway-- it's the connect. PAUL: What are you saying? -What he's saying is he's going to go for it. -That's right, Jack. I'm going to check things out here and then go talk to the producer about that. See you in a bit. -So long, Glen. -Hey, Glen. Wait a minute. Hey, uh-- who's the new pit tootsie? -You noticed her. -She's got great lips. -She's a writer from the East. She's doing a story about us. -Ah. So I wouldn't be horning in if I-- -No. No, go ahead. She's too fast for me. PAUL: Yeah? She don't look the type. -She's hot. You better watch out. She'll cover you like mold. -Yeah. -Hey, Pauly. -Yeah? -You know what they call her? -What? -BJ. -Hey, uh. Want to take a picture of a real hot stuntman? -Sure. -All right. Anytime you're ready. -OK. -Wait a minute. -OK. -You know, uh-- I'm better in the flesh than I am in photographs. -Really? -I'm Italian. Italians are the best lovers in the world. Did you know that? -Well, I tell you what. Why don't you get a couple of other Italians, come to my room, and we'll have a little party. -What do you mean, a couple? What do you mean a couple more? -Two more guys. Isn't that a real party? -What, do you think I'm a sicko? -What's the matter? You've never been with two girls before? -Hey, two girls is fun. Two guys is queer. -In the movie business? -You're warped, you know that? You're real sick. [LAUGHS] -Honey? Glen! Good to see you. Welcome aboard. -Thank you, Alvin. -My wife, Judy, the star of this epic. Glen Wilson, our new stunt coordinator. -Hi, Glen. Nice to meet you. -Sit down. JUDY: It was awful about your brother. I'm so sorry. -Honey, I'm sure Glen knows how we feel about his brother. Listen, why don't you go to your room and memorize your lines. -What? -I know you know them. We just want to talk some business here. -OK, fine. I'm sure I'll be seeing you again, Glen. -See you later. How about a drink? -Let's talk business. -Good. Did you come up with a blockbuster gag for me? -Alvin, there ain't nothing wrong with the stunt you've got. -Everything is wrong with a gag that kills people. -That stunt was in my brother's mind for years. He knew it. -So what happened? -I don't know. But I'm going to do that stunt. -Look, I don't want this picture to become a personal proving ground for anybody, for any reason. You got me getting serious, here. Are we making a movie, or are we making a movie? Come on. -You just think about it, Alvin. I'm sure you're going like it. -I've already thought about it. The answer's no. Flat out, no. -I'm glad you agree with me. Let me have drink. -Miss. EARL (VOICEOVER): Help him get dressed. GREG (VOICEOVER): Let's do it. EARL (VOICEOVER): Good luck. We're standing by. GREG (VOICEOVER): OK, let's make a good one, huh? EARL (VOICEOVER): Action! Bring him down! Bring him down! It's not working. Come on, get him d-- [SCREAM] WOMAN: Right behind you. -Where are they going? -Stuntman dies, he gets a stuntman's funeral. -Adios, my man! -To tomorrow. PAUL: What's so special about tomorrow? -Nothing, I hope. No bruises, no broken bones, no nothing. -Keep making the stunts tougher, people are going to get hurt. -Yeah. You guys heard about what about happened to Bobby Rogers, right? Car rolls right over him in a gag. So he's laying up in a hospital. He's never going to be able to talk. He's never going to be able to walk. He's a vegetable. -In that condition, I'd just assume push right on through to the other side. -Living like that's like living dead. -Worse. You might wake up. -Yeah. But even worse, Bobby doesn't have a choice. -Why don't we make a deal, man? All right? If one of us takes it in the shorts, the others pull the plug. -I'm in. -Let's all agree, all around. -I'm in, too. Yeah. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Let's wing it. -When's this ramp going to be ready? -10 minutes, more or less. Plenty of extra hammers. Right, Pauly? -Let's go. Let's go. Can we move it, please? -Bring it over here. MAN: [INAUDIBLE]. MAN: Yeah, he's in the truck. MAN: Give me a hand, here. -Howdy. You a stuntman? -Yeah, I been known to wreck a few things. -Yeah, I thought about being a stuntman. You ever see anybody bust a beer can in half with their nose? See? I got guts. I could be a stuntman. How about giving me a chance, huh? -Hey, kid. When we do the scene where the guy breaks the can over his nose, we'll call you. -Hey. That's good. That's terrific. You got a good dentist? -That's it, now. Just keep them apart. All right? [INAUDIBLE] -Come on. Let's roll. We'll give you three whistles, and then you go. GLEN: Got it. -Everybody got it? MAN: Yo. -Three whistles. MAN: You got it. -Can you give me a lift up to the camera? -Sure. -Thanks. -Here. Why don't you just put those in? BJ: Oh, I see. -There you go. That's right. Lock them in [INAUDIBLE]. OK. [THREE WHISTLES] -Do you have to drive so fast? -Oh my god. Hey, come on. Slow down. Please slow down! Jeez, stop! Please, stop! EARL: And cut! [APPLAUSE] -[INAUDIBLE] -Yeah. -Yeah? Super roll. Just super. Beautiful. [LAUGHTER] -Welcome to the club. How'd you like it? -You stupid son of a bitch. -I thought she'd love it. RECEPTIONIST (ON PHONE): Front desk. -Messages for room 131, please. -Hi. Nice room. RECEPTIONIST (ON PHONE): All clear, sir. -Thank you. -Nice, uh, bed. -Hasn't failed me yet. -Why don't you go ahead and change? I'm not going to go anywhere. -Maybe you ought to go back to your husband. -Why? Greg wasn't afraid of him. -Greg had one rule. No married women. -We both had rules. And we both broke them. And let me tell you, it was worth every minute of it. I know what you're thinking. But Greg and I were very, very close. -Then what are you doing here? -Well, you can't blame me for wondering if certain traits run in the family. -You're not hard up, are you? -No. I'm not. -What do you like? Causing trouble? -I told you. I was hoping for a copy of the original. -Mm mm. -OK. Fine, Glen. I guess the original is always better than a fake. -Hey, goomba. -Hey. -Where's the harness? -Hey, man. Don't torture yourself. --[INAUDIBLE], if I'm going to do the stunt, I gotta see the harness. I want to see what went wrong. -What went wrong, man, was that he couldn't make the hookup under those conditions. -How do you know? How do you know somebody didn't screw around with it? -Well, because one of us would have noticed. -In that case, where's the harness? -It's in his room with the rest of the gear. -No it ain't. -Hey, wait. Wait a minute. Where you going? -I got a gag to set up. Are we making a movie, or are we making a movie? -OK. Get her in there. -She's too long, Pete. -The chase cars'll be heading east. -All right, seal it up good. We don't want the compression from the charge leaking out the sides. MAN: That camera in there solid? EARL: Get this car into the garage so we can load the dynamite. -Glen's not home. -I know that. And stop spying on me. -Then stop making it necessary. Come on, get in. We're going to the cannon roll location. -It's good from up here. -What you got in there? -All right. You got five and a half ounces. That'll give you three rolls exactly at 40 miles an hour. -What do we need for five? -You don't want to do five. -How much? -Look, you start loading that much powder under you, and things get scary. I can't guarantee what'll happen. You may get five, you may get six, you may get four. There's no telling where the hell you're gonna end up. -We give ourselves plenty of room. -There's also a possibility of getting your ass blown sky high. -Give me 15. -OK, Superman. Runs in the family, doesn't it? -Is he right? -If he is, you got a hell of a story, don't you, lady? -Can I ask you a question? How would you say your work differs from that of a professional athlete? -Who says it does? -Well, I don't know. I mean, a professional athlete gets all the money and the glory. And you get the money. But the glory goes to the actor. -Ain't that the truth, lady? -OK. Should we talk about you, specifically? You were a college professor, I believe. -Who told you that? -Well, I did a little research. You know, picked a few things up. It is my job. [BELCHES] -All right. We're going in ten minutes. -Uh, excuse me. You did the special effects on a picture called "Red Flame." -Yeah, that's right. -I believe two men got killed on that. -Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, I see. That makes it OK, does it? -Look, darling, I only rig the stunts. I don't operate them. -I hear you're having a little trouble with your boys on this picture. Is that true? -How's it look, Chuck? All right, pull it up. That's it. -Yeah, good. EARL: You set? GLEN: Do I looks set? -The automatic transmission's slipping. I have to pull out with my foot on the break. -Double the hero, and they give you a Ferrari. -Listen, Glen. I need this one. -You need every one you can get, pal. -Make me look good, will you? MAN: Hey, Paul. You guys ready? -Yo. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] my man. EARL: Let's do it, Chuck. MAN: Let's kick the living stuffings out of [INAUDIBLE] baby! -[INAUDIBLE]. -Everybody freeze. Keep that camera rolling. If he's dead, we can't help him. And if he's hurt, 15 seconds won't matter much. [CHEERING] EARL: And cut! -All right! Yeah! That was something else. -[INAUDIBLE], man. -Did you see that [INAUDIBLE]. -How'd it look? -Well, I can live with it. But don't let it go to your head. -Just like my old man. A real putz. -Pop my knee back, will you, son? [SNAP] Thank you. -One of these days this knee ain't going to go back. Then they're gonna know I ain't Superman. -For a minute, I thought you went past it. But you just punched it, right at the right moment. -How many rolls did we get? -Like five and a half. But it must have felt like about 15. The cannon head went way out in the field, over the other camera crew. -Hey, you're Glen, right? Hey, that was really terrific. Really. I couldn't have done better, myself. My name's Dave. -Dave. -Watch this. Let's say my hands are tied behind my back. -Yeah. -OK, now. Take a punch at me. -Who put him up to this? -No. No, really. Really, fake a punch at me. -He takes a lot of damage on his face, don't he? -What do you think? -I think you're crazy, buddy. -So can I work for you. -Not in this lifetime. -Give him a break. -You be willing to wash stuff? Clean up equipment? -Hey, you name it, I'll do it. -Come on. -[INAUDIBLE]. [DOOR SLAMMING] -What are you doing here? -What do you expect? You've been acting very suspiciously lately. -I have? -Oh, I've see you sneaking into the stunt van, rummaging around, sneaking into Paul's truck. -Lady, I don't have to sneak any place. -Hey, I don't blame you. God knows, it wouldn't be very difficult to sabotage a stunt. Even I could do it. -I don't believe you, lady. You're here 24 hours, and you know everything about everything, don't you. -Well, maybe I do. -Maybe you don't. -Personally, I suspect your special effects guy, Pete Lustig. -What reason you got to suspect anybody of anything. -Look, you just came off a movie where they were offering you twice as much money as you're getting on this picture. -I'm crazy, lady. I'm bedrock crazy. Don't forget that. -Anything you say. -Why do you suspect Pete Lustig? -You see? You do believe me. -I don't believe anything you've got to say. In fact, I'm sorry I asked. -I'm ready here. You want to start it up? I'll double check the other side, too. Yeah, it seems OK. -Come with me. -Now? It's, uh, lunchtime. -Are you hungry? -Oh, I might be talked into a bite or two. -Chuck. If we make love now, we can make that baby. -Hey. Thanks a lot. When did you drop the pill? And why didn't you tell me? -We agreed last week I could get pregnant. So I stopped taking the pill. -We agreed when we were settled down. You call this settled down? We have a kid now, we're going to have to have him on wheels. -When the picture's over, we'll be settled down. Oh, I know. You were offered another picture, right? -Right. But I didn't take it. -You called back and you said that you'd think about it. -Right. What am I supposed to do when they keep upping the money? -You're supposed to say that you're a responsible, married man, Chuck. And then start acting like one. -I am a responsible married man. I'm just as responsible as anybody. -[INAUDIBLE]. WOMAN: Anyone got the makeup case? MAN: Over here. -Any problem with these blowers so far? -Seems OK. -Did you, uh, inspect every seam like I asked you to? -Yes, sir. -I--I had to shake out the vent a little bit, but it's coming in all right now. -This is one piece of equipment I don't want to have malfunction. Had a seam blow on me last year, and I went right through. -What happened? -Well, managed to walk away. But it sure knocked the stuffing out of me. Don't want that to happen today. Just keep inflating. You can't overdo it. -OK. Here's what I want. Glen, Paul, Patti. I want you three repelling up. Chuck, you're on the roof. At that point, you throw up three rounds to Paulie. Paulie, you get hit in the chest. You die on the ropes right there. And then the ground fire gets you. You take your call. -I'll have to take my own cue. That's all right. You're gonna be covered with four cameras, anyway. -Yeah, I'll swing over and get Paul then. -And then if you need help, you call on Glen. And then you both can come on down. Now, this is a big stunt. And I want it done right. Got it? -Yeah, we got it. Three up. One down. -Happy landings. -Sensitive guy, huh? -Sweet luck, Charlie. -Take care of your face, Chuckie-poo. What are you looking at? -I'll see you in a minute, hoss. -Double check those carabiner clips. MAN: [INAUDIBLE]. PAUL: Where's my other glove? -[INAUDIBLE], will you? -OK. Now, move it in. -Get that as tight as you can. -Let's shoot it. -Is it all right? -Yeah. I think so. GLEN: How'd the kid do on the bag? PAUL: Bag's OK. So's the kid. -You guys set? -Check. I'm straight. [YELLING] GLEN: Pauly. Talk to that kid, will you? -I got it. I got it. Hey, [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Jesus christ. What's the matter with you, man? We get $1,500 a jump. And you're giving it away. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Who is he? Who is he? -How'd you like the fall? Pretty good stunt, huh? -Listen, you dumb jaboney, I ought to kick your ass right off this set. -Sorry, I-- -Sorry won't pay for the time we'll lose resetting this bag. Now, next time you want to do a jump, do it without the bag. All right, everybody. Take ten minutes. We're on a break. -I thought you were on our side. -Sorry, I-- sorry. -I got this new honey. She's waiting in the van for me. Ten minutes isn't much time. But I'm going to give it a shot. -Watch out for the husband. -Give me a [INAUDIBLE], would you, Glen? -Hey, uh, hon? These, uh, sledgehammers, they just aren't going away. -How about if I get you some aspirin, hon? -Thanks, I appreciate that. -OK. See you in a minute. -Tough break, Chuck. -Yeah. Hey, uh, Glen? How about if you do the high fall, and, uh, I take the repel? -You're getting $800 for the stunt. You got a hangover that bad? -Well, it, uh, wasn't just the hangover. I, uh, had a bad experience up there. I looked down, and I just knew I was going to buy the farm. -All right. That's not a feeling we're going to argue with. Change clothes. -Thanks, pal. EARL: Action! [INAUDIBLE] now. And try to stay together. Patti, you're getting too far ahead. That's better! OK. Keep it together now. You're good! Together! -I can't hold on. I can't hold on much longer! -Just grab me! -I can't do it! -[INAUDIBLE]! [YELLING] -Oh, Chuck! GLEN: Get an ambulance! -He's alive. -How is he. -He's on a respirator. He has a complete fracture of the cervical spine. His diaphragm is paralyzed. I'm afraid that he will always be on a respirator. -No. BJ: It's OK. -No. -It's OK. -Impossible. -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry, kid. -Come on. I'll take you. -All right. I'll flip you for it. Heads. -Tails. -This ain't for us, Chuck. Talked to the doctor. Said you're busted up pretty good. Says you're alive. That ain't much, Chuck. I talked to Patti. She's all right. Ain't nobody crying and moaning. They're all right, too. Doc says if you ever wake up, you ain't gonna move. That's why I'm here, Chuck. Deal's a deal. If it was me, I'd expect you to do the same thing. There ain't nothing in my life I've been afraid of except being where you are right now. I just didn't expect it to be this tough. Sweet luck, baby. Sweet luck. [FLATLINE BEEP] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Give me another drink, honey. This business. This whole goddamn, stinking business stinks. -Stinks. Stinks like dog shit. -You and the other stuntmen. You think it's great. You love every minute of it. And you and Glen are going to get out there tomorrow and do the same thing. You're all alike. You're crazy. -Maybe, baby. But you're going to be right there with us. Because you're crazy, too, Patti. -Give me another one, honey. -I think you've had enough. -Who are you to tell me that I've had enough? -I'm just somebody who cares. You don't care. You don't know how to care. You can still walk, Paulie! -Come here! -Through with them Hollywood faggots, baby? -I hate you! I hate all of you! Sorry. -Would you go after myself, or Glen? -No, I guess not. -She's one of us. Capiche? Kitten. Let's go dance. [DOG HOWLING] -Where are you? -Who says I'm here? -Nosy broad like you. [INAUDIBLE] -I haven't checked the equipment yet. -Why not? -I don't really know how it works. -What are you doing here, then? -Just making sure nobody else checks it. -How's Chuck? -He's dead. -You know that whoever meant to kill him meant to kill you. -Mm hm. -Well, then why isn't anybody going to get the police? -Because it's not the way we handle things. We take care of our own. Want to have a drink? -Yeah, OK. -Say what you want. -I'll have a Virgin Mary, please. -Virgin Mary? I thought you came out to do some drinking. -It always has to be a contest, doesn't it? -Hey, goomba. I mean, uh, we look like a pair of aces, or what? -You look like a full house to me. -I'll have a bottle of tequila, some limes, and two glasses, please. -[SPEAKING ITALIAN] Did you know that water beds are good for your back? Hey! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? My god, it finally happened. -Honey! We didn't do nothing. I promise! I love you, honey! -You got quite a setup here, boy. -Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute! -You want to play, eh? PAUL: Listen! -Well, you're going to pay. -You really don't want to do this, you know? I mean, you guys got a lot of juice in the White House now. And you don't want to give Jimmy a bad name. -You better start praying, boy. -No, wait a minute! REDNECK: I mean now. Wait a minute! REDNECK: I mean now! Now! Come on, trash. -Redneck! GLEN: Can you handle the [INAUDIBLE], baby? BJ: Oh, sure. GLEN: There we go. -You know, when you're a judge's daughter, you have to-- you have to drink with the boys. Level up to the [INAUDIBLE]. -I'll buy that. -Well, listen, it's your fault. You know, you got me drunk at the bar. I mean, it's, uh-- it's your fault. -I'm a regular little devil about things. -I bet you are. -Yes. Here we go. Another couple of steps. That'll do, Patti. -[INAUDIBLE]? -I think so. -Oh, god. -You all right? -Yeah. Find my key. You know, it's amazing when I--when I have a drink. And I feel, uh-- quite wide awake. -Well, you're a very unusual woman. -Oh, thank you. -Should I do that for you? -Oh, thank you. Oh, I-- I'm sorry. -It's all right. -Thank you for a [INAUDIBLE] evening. BJ: What's it like? GLEN: What's what like? BJ: The helicopter stunt. GLEN: Oh. Well it's-- noisy, windy. You know. BJ: Tell me. Tomorrow? GLEN: Yep. BJ: Why do you automatically rule out Paul and Patti as the killers? I don't understand. GLEN: They're stunt people. BJ: Are you telling me there's no professional jealousy in your business? No competition? I mean, what century are you living in? GLEN: The one before women learned how to talk, doll. -Well, you only want me to tell you what you want to hear. Is that it? -You don't know what I want to hear. -Well, do you want to hear that I actually worry about you? Hm? That I'm afraid for you. -You can say that if you want to. However, don't dwell on it. -Would you like to know what conclusion I came to in my article? -Sure. -Well, I think that what you do is search for the truth. You can't bullshit a stunt. It either works or it doesn't. -Very heavy. How are you at the truth? -Pretty good, I think. -Well, in that case, let me say this. I can't promise you anything. I can't promise you this thing isn't just a one night stand. -OK. But don't dwell on it. -What happened, Pete? -I don't know. -The fastener was loose, right? -No. -What do you mean no? We just saw this poor bastard fall six stories! -Now, you listen to me. Now, you-- goddamn it, you listen to me. I've done a dozen of these pictures. I'm the best in my profession. I've been nominated 3 times. And I won an award. You don't lay this thing on me. That piton pin is still up there in the wall where I left it. We checked it. Everything was fine-- including the carabiner clip. -Until it wasn't. -It's one big express ride back down to the street, eh, Pete? -Well, he should have checked it! -Come on, Glen. This place is starting to smell. MAN: 123 echo, take two. EARL: Everybody ready? MAN: Standing by. EARL: Are you ready, Judy? -Yes, yes, yes. EARL: OK. Camera. MAN: Cameras rolling. EARL: And action, Judy. -It's not that I didn't recognize you at first. I did. But it was just that the g-- gosh, sorry. -Keep the camera rolling. Go on back and do it again, dear. MAN: 350. EARL: The camera's still rolling. Are you ready, Judy? OK. -It's not that I didn't recognize you at first. It's just that I thought that what's-- who the hell wrote this crap? -Keep the camera rolling. This is it. This is the one, Judy, dear. Come on. [SCREAMS] MAN: Oh my god! EARL: I don't believe this. MAN: Who the hell is that? -Woo! Hey, did you see that? Must've been about 100 yards. -Look what you did to my rig, man! DAVE: Perfect two wheeler, wasn't it? PAUL: Beautiful. Beautiful. Notice where you wound up? Cute. PAUL: Very nice. PAUL: Yeah, real nice. That's a $600 car. -Well, at least nobody got hurt. GLEN: This time. -Isn't that what it takes? It was a good stunt. You guys are crazy. -Hey. You got a wreck in the middle of the street. Get it out of here. ALVIN: What the hell's going on? I turn my back for a minute, you got a car in the street. Wait just a minute. I want to talk to you. Excuse us, will you? The hell is this about firing Pete Lustig? I'm the producer around here. I fire people. -Pete Lustig is beginning to bother my ass. -That's no excuse to fire a man. -I got the fire gag coming up. I don't trust him. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. In the first place, there's no proof the man's incompetent. In the second place, I got no time to get another special effects crew. Help me, please. I need a safe stunt. Help me out. -We got a stunt. -The chopper gag. I don't need that gag. -It's safe. I tell you, I worked the thing out. -That's what your brother said. -You want the gag, you do it. Otherwise, you hire somebody else. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right. All right. All right. All right, do it. And Lustig stays. -If he screws up, I'm coming after your ass. -All right. Come after my ass. I love it. But give me a stunt. Give me a big stunt. A blockbuster. I want them to sit there and hold their breaths till their faces turn blue. I want them to fall down in their seats. That's what I need. A blockbuster. I know you can do it. Thank you. [YELLING] [INAUDIBLE] street! Are we making a movie, or are we making a movie? -Listen, Marie. Why don't we take you first, since you're older by a week. Am I right? -Uh, how about me? Don't I get a ride. -Well, uh, I didn't think that you, uh, dug motorcycles. -Well, they're sexy, aren't they? -Excuse me, honey. I want to, you know-- she's an old friend of mine. I want to take her for a ride. I'll be right back, OK? Be right back. How are you, honey? I haven't seen you in a long time. -I'm fine. Good. -All right. Be back in a couple minutes, all right? JACK (ON PHONE): What's going on up there, Blake? You working for a studio or a funeral home? -Jack, we've got two dead stuntmen on film. You know that. It's going to make the publicity campaign I initiated even stronger. -Something you're not telling me, Blake? I mean, because if this one doesn't work, you're out. -It's going to work, Jack. I tell you, it's going to work. Now, listen. A disaster on the set is every inch as strong as a disaster on film. I know that. -And I know that we can't have any more dead stuntmen. -Jack, are we making a movie, or are we making a movie? JACK (ON PHONE): Just get this damn picture finished. You won't be the first son-in-law I've fired. -Right, right, right. -Did Daddy say how I looked in the dailies. -He said you looked fabuloso. -Liar. All he cares about is the stunts. -Judy, baby-- -Don't Judy baby me. He doesn't give a damn about acting, and you and I both know it. -Your Daddy loves you. And he's proud of you. -Well, I'm not. -What? -Nothing. -Where are you going? -Out. -What for. -I don't know. -A little piece of paper, eh? -That's right. So we got to be real careful from here on out. -Oh. Look how easy it is to jimmy this gag. -Yeah, it makes it easy to look like an accident, too. What about my husband? -Ironic. -You mean they were trying to get you? Yo. So that means whoever it is had to have close access to the gear, and had to be close to the stunts. PATTI: And that makes a lot of people around here suspect. PAUL: Well, why don't we just close down set, man? PAUL: If we close down, we never know who or why. -You're up. -Let's do it. MAN: Get those wires down. MAN: Going as fast as they can, buddy. BJ: What's that he's putting on now? PAUL: We call it underwear, honey. OK. -OK. PAUL: There. PATTI: Wait a minute. You know when you start, you've got two minutes of air, OK? GLEN: Yeah. -How's it feel? All right? -Fine. DAVE: Tight enough? GLEN: Yup. OK. PAUL: You have access to the gauge in case you need it? GLEN: Yeah. PAUL: Let's stuff that in there. Disconnect that thing. [INAUDIBLE] -Can we snap it up? We're in a bit of a hurry. -Hold the phone, willya? The last thing we want is another disaster. -All right. I'll take your cue. Then I'll start the cameras rolling. -Pete? What do you got to say? -All right, now, Glen. I want you people to be aware that this structure is bone dry. You also have to take into consideration that it's full of holes and there's a wind factor up here. So we fire, and it's going. Paul, you go out the trap. -Right, I'm gonna [INAUDIBLE]. DAVE: How do you feel? GLEN: [INAUDIBLE]. -Hey, uh-- how dangerous is this? I mean, has anyone ever died from it? -What? -This stunt-- is it dangerous? -No. No, it's easy. It's a piece of cake. -OK. You know the signal for extinguish as soon as I hit the dirt. -Right. Gotcha. -We'll be there. -OK. We got, uh, 15 seconds before the [INAUDIBLE] before this shack's gonna blow. You feel good? -Yup. -All right. -OK. I'm going on air. Ask him if he's ready. PATTI: Right. You've got two minutes of air. MAN: Quiet, please. PAUL: You guys ready down there, or what? Hey, come on, you guys. Clear it out of here, eh? MAN: High-speed camera ready. MAN: You ready? PAUL: Sit him down, willya? This is it. Can you see? All clear! Get out of here. Beat it. All right, you ready? Camera one, two, three, four, five, six-- -Light the fire! PAUL: --seven-- MAN: [INAUDIBLE]. PAUL: --nine-- EARL: Roll camera! PAUL: --eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. MAN: OK. [INAUDIBLE] she's fired! MAN: Rolling two. Action! PAUL: I'm headed out the [INAUDIBLE]. Hey. What's going on out there? Hey, come on. Let me out! [INAUDIBLE] Hey, I'm burning! Help me! I'm burning! -Cut! -[INAUDIBLE]. MAN: Cool it down. -All right, all right. Easy, easy, easy. -Beautiful. -You OK? -[INAUDIBLE]. -Terrific. -Where's Paulie? -What do you mean, where's Paulie? I didn't see him come out. -Where's Paulie? -Jesus christ, did Paulie get out? -Hi. Is there anything I can do? -I don't think so, baby. -Well, would you like a drink. -I was just going to get out of here. -Do you want some company? -I just gotta think this thing through. -OK. Bartender. [MUSIC PLAYING] -See ya, doll. -Glen? [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] -What the hell do you mean, he'll get back to me as soon as he can? We're doing a movie, here! A movie! A movie! What do you mean, you don't like being yelled at? Then don't be a secretary! -That was stupid. -I don't need you to tell me what's stupid. -Wrong. You do need me. And don't you forget it. -I don't need advice from a whore. What are you doing? -I'm calling Daddy. And I'll get through to [INAUDIBLE]. -Sure. Get through to Daddy. And he'll find out what his daughter is really like. -[INAUDIBLE]. Because you don't know. -Oh, but Greg does? Greg knows, doesn't he? Who else knows? Who else? Come on. Come on. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. [INAUDIBLE] assistant. The second assistant. The third assistant. [INAUDIBLE]. Come on, tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Come on. Who haven't you slept with? Tell me. -You. -[INAUDIBLE] you. You low-life rich bitch. [SCREAM] -Davy. You been working with the car? -Yeah, the mechanic and I quickened up the steering. -You think you can get that up on two wheels on purpose? -I went over 100 yards this morning. -100 yards, eh? You ever hear Paulie say, "going for it?" -Every time he did a stunt. GLEN: Know what he meant? -No fear. Total concentration. He said it was somewhere between an art and a science. -Tell you what to do in case you smell trouble? -Protect the guys whose life depends on you. -You got all the answers, don't you? -I'm going for it. -All right. This thing takes more brains than balls. You know that. One last thing. Never ruin the man's shot. -I heard that. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Hey, Glen. You gonna wear the harness? -I haven't figured that out yet. [CRYING] JUDY: I'm not a whore. -Hey, Judy, are you OK? What is it? Hey, what happened? Are you OK? Oh my god. Who did that? Who was it? -Blake. -Why'd he do it? -He's crazy. -Is he crazy because you were having an affair with Greg? Is that why he killed Greg? Is it? Is it? -Yes. -And what about Paul and Chuck? Did he do that too? Did he? -I don't know. Glen came to the set and acted suspicious. Blake just kind of freaked out. He just kind of freaked out! -Yeah. I guess he just freaked out. JUDY: Oh my god. Glen! HELICOPTER PILOT: [INAUDIBLE]. Ready two. Looking real good. PATTI: Take it slow, will you. huh? -Hey, Glen. [CHATTER] WOMAN: Good luck! EARL: Come on. Let's get that car for him. MAN: Here, let me get that [INAUDIBLE]. MAN: Ready at the ramp. MAN: Roger. Glen's on his way. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] off the [INAUDIBLE]. MAN: Move that ambulance up. PATTI: All right. Here he comes. Let's go. MAN: He's at position one now. GLEN: Check the ramp? -It's safe. MAN: Where's the crash truck? -It's OK. MAN: Crash truck's ready. EARL: Camera two is reloading. Are you set at one? MAN: This is one. He's just getting to the car. EARL: Let me know when he's ready. MAN: Will do. EARL: Get the camera car lined up. -All right, Davy. You ready? -Yes, sir. -All right. Nice and relaxed. A lot of concentration. You'll be all right. MAN: Go for it, Glen! GLEN: You bet, Billy. -We're all standing by here. Camera ready? MAN: Camera's ready. EARL: All right.

HELICOPTER PILOT: Starting to hookup now. -You've got to stop the stunt. stunt. -What are you talking about? -Stop that stunt! EARL: You crazy, or something? BJ: Blake rigged all their damn stunts. And now Glen's going to get killed. Are you going to stop it? EARL: Keep that camera rolling, no matter what happens. -Hello? Tell Glen that BJ says it's Blake. BJ says it's Blake! It's Blake!
