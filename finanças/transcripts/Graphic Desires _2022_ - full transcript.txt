I want you. Do you want me? Uh-huh. Now your turn, Frankie. Yeah, just like that. Could you turn around for me? Whatever you want, baby. That's it. Hold it right there. I've almost got it. -Oh shit. -What's going on, baby? You still have 20 minutes left. Sorry! What are you doing sat here in the dark? Oh, you know, just glued to the screen. Didn't expect you back so soon. Yeah, after-work drinks were canceled. You know, I think Penny from Fairfield Capital is pregnant again. So, no more Prosecco lunches for me for nine months. Speaking of which, do you fancy a G&T? Yeah, sure. Why not? So, I take it Futuracom are still giving you grief over their new logo. Absolute nightmare, so many different departments and none of them know what the rest are doing. They want to future-proof their design whilst keeping it contemporary, and yet reassuringly retro. Haven't you talked to Brandon about it? I'm still not sure what he actually does there, you know? Still, the money's good, which is the main thing, I suppose, and I get to play with some pretty cool beta apps before the general public do. Oh yeah? Anything I'd be into? No, just geeky shit. Well, happy hump day. Hump day? Yeah, it's what the kids call Wednesday. I swear, you are like two years older than me, and it feels like a century some days. Still, it's because you don't speak to many teenagers in your line of work. In fact, you don't speak to many people at all, do you? Don't suppose you've thought any more about going permanent. Garamond and Baskerville are always looking for designers. Come on, it's a great place to work. You know, they just got rid of all the chairs and replaced them with exercise bikes, so you can tighten your glutes whilst you're at it. Sounds fucking awful. Yeah, well, it can't be good for you, being stuck in the apartment by yourself all day. I'm just someone who works from home, okay? Not a recluse. One day, we'll all be doing this. We'll be looking back at the nine to five and going, what the fuck were we thinking? That's not what I was-- Well, hey, look, you think I don't go out enough, that's fine, I'll go out more. In fact, I'll give Brandon a call right now to see if he fancies a pint. Don't. It is a rare evening when I'm not working late, or at the gym, or having drinks with a client. Oh shit, it's Brandon. I really do need to talk to him about this logo. Look, we can, you know, when I get back, all right? I won't be late, I promise. I won't wait up. Hey Brando, what's going on? Yeah! That question again, what is the largest landlocked country in Africa? She's still giving me grief about the whole freelance thing, keeps trying to get me to get a proper job with some ex-boyfriend of hers. Is it Chad? No, this posh twat's name is Garamond, apparently. The landlocked African country, you bell end. How do you cope working in an office nine to five, huh? Easy, I don't. I work 11 to 4. Yeah, but still, you're in an office, right? With, you know, a boss and a desk and, I don't know, a water cooler. And talent. Don't forget the talent. Not that you can even so much as look at a woman inside work nowadays. Hash tag MeToo and all that. But outside work? Outside work is all good. So you're still working your way through Tinder then, are you? Tinder? Completed, dude. No, I'm all over this new app Smasher. It's the future, and as a futurologist, I am the motherfucking Nostradamus of apps. It's basically Uber meets Tinder. You rate people on their chat, sexual performance. Early buzz is, people are calling it Dickadvisor. This is just a reminder that cheating on your mobile device will result in instant disqualification. So they're the chicks I've been with, and the stars I've given them. All right, so what, can you see what rating they've given you? Not technically, but if I switch to one of my female catfish accounts. It's not five out of five because, well, there was this one drunk chick who... She tried to steal one of my limited addition Lord of the Rings Funkos. She gave me zero stars, but trust me, that was reciprocated. You should, you know, get yourself on there, mate. Don't worry about Candida. Get yourself on there with a fake name, and she'll never know. I don't think it's for me. Thanks, though. It's sex on tap. Who isn't that for? Come on, monogamy is about as obsolete as an iPod or a fax machine. Think of it as freelancing your dick to a new client each night. I would never cheat on Candida, okay? I'm happy with her, and she's happy with me. So why are you in here trying to remember the capitol of Panama and not home with her? Next question, and indeed, the penultimate question. What is the second rule of Fight Club? I don't want to talk about it, okay? What Futuracom is going to do with this here digital DNA is they're creating a whole bunch of cyber zombie techno clones and spreading them all throughout the internet, and that is the godawful truth about Futuracom and 5G technology! Right, better go get this flight. Mm-hm. I'll be back in a couple of days, and there's an Ocado shop arriving tomorrow, so don't worry, you won't starve. -Uh-huh. -Okay, I'll see you soon. Behave yourself. You're the one going to Berlin. I'm stuck here. Well, if I end up in any late night techno clubs where people piss on each other, I'll be sure to drink sensibly. Bye. Worried she won't come? Worried she won't be as hot as her picture? Or that she doesn't actually exist and it's all a catfish? We've all been there, buddy. Just waiting for a friend, actually. Yeah, right. Look, there you go. On the house, while you wait for your date. -Thanks. -That should be six quid! I'd be bloody grateful if I was you. Be lucky. Franklin? Hi. Very British, I like it. I'm Atlanta. So shall we get a drink? Yeah, sure, sorry. It's table service here, so. All right, go on then. So what's your favorite thing about London? Oh my God, I don't know. I love the whole vibe. You know, the multiculturalism and the history. Like, oh my God, the fact that Harry fucking Potter and Sherlock Holmes, like, lived here? Oh, the all-night bagel place on Brick Lane, and the fact that you can get coke delivered like 24/7. Okay, when you put it that way, it sounds like a pretty good place to live, actually. You know, I've only been here, like, six months, so there's a lot more to explore, and I'm not in Kansas anymore. Wait, you're not actually from Kansas, are you? Born and bred. And one day, I will click my ruby slippers and go back home, but not yet. I still need to find a man. One with a brain, a heart, and courage. Tall order. So, what made you click on my profile in the app? Like, what made you choose me? -I don't know. -You said it was because you imagined I smelled like cigarettes and avocados. Okay, so maybe I was a bit more poetic online than I am in person. Aren't we all, sugar? So, I've got to use the little girls' room, so you better still be here when I get back. Deal. Oh shit. Is something wrong? No, no, just work. For a second there, I thought you were making an excuse to ditch me. No way. No, no. How about we change the scenery? We could hit the all night bagel place on Brick Lane and pick up a bottle from one of the local stores. We could drink it back at my place. Yeah, sure. Okay. Oh shit. The fuck is this? Oh, God. I'm Sorry about the mess. It's all right, no, you should see my place, really. Be quiet, some of my flatmates are, like, assholes. Okay. -Shit. -You all right? You okay? So much much for being quiet, God. Did you know that how you die in your past life explains your phobias in the next one? So, like, if you drown, when you're next reincarnated you're, like, scared of water. So if I'd have died falling down the stairs then, then I'd be scared of, like, I don't know, stairs. Or drunk English guys. I could never be scared of you. I don't normally do this on a first date. Me either. We can stop if you want. Don't. That's my room there. Make yourself at home. I'll go and get some glasses for this wine. I'm sorry, these were all I could find. It's fine, really. So do you want the glass or the mug? I'll have the mug. I insist. I don't mean to sound like a goddamn broken record, but I'm so sorry about the mess. Honestly, it's fine. Talking of records, shall we have some music? Sure, yeah. So what type of music do you like? You like old music? No offense. I've only got like four records, so this is gonna have to do, yeah? -Sure. -Okay. Silence makes me feel, like, uncomfortable. You don't have any coke on you, do you? No. I could call someone, if you really want. No, I'm good. I love this tune, don't you? Yeah, I mean... All right, I'm going to be honest, I have no idea who the hell this is. Listen, do you mind if I... Okay, this is going to sound kind of weird, but I really want to remember tonight. I want to prove to myself this actually happened. Sure. Let's give you something worth recording. Those things you said you were going to do to me in those texts last night. Did you mean them? Yeah. I mean, assuming you still want me to. I consent to everything. And anything. And you have that on video now. It's okay, Franklin is alive. Don't take the piss. If I don't check if he's eaten, he'll starve to death by the time I'm back. Don't be mean. He's your bloody friend. So what's the excuse for not replying last night? He says he fell asleep watching Netflix. It's boring enough to be true, as well. He should be out boning while you're not there. Hey! He's a good person. He's not like you. Or you. Yeah, well, that is exactly why this has to stop. Come on. Didn't you say that last time? And the time before that. Yeah, and I mean it this time. I mean, honestly, what are you even doing flying all the way to bloody Berlin just because I'm here? I actually came to check out this new street art installation. You were just a bonus. Yeah, well, I'm going to get in the shower. My flight is in a few hours. I'll join you. No way. So, my flight was delayed. There were about a million stag dos at Berlin Airport. Oh, and my Uber driver tried to convert me to Scientology on the way home. Open some fucking wine, won't you? Noir or Grigio? Let's go noir. Thanks, babe. So, how was Berlin? Oh, you know, exhausting. And ever since Brexit, I swear, I cannot cope with that look that Europeans give us. You know, that kind of pitying, patronizing one, like we're all children who've done something stupid. Anyway, what have you been up to whilst the cat's been away? You know, the usual. Not a lot. If this couldn't wait for a pint at the Dog and Defibrillator, it must be important. All right, fine, but look, before I tell you, you have to promise, not a word of this to anyone. And by anyone, I mean Candida. Come on, it's not like me and your missus are best gal pals, is it? All right, what does it mean when it says this? Have you been using Smasher? And now some chick's ghosted you? Ghosted? Yeah, when, you know, someone stops responding to your texts, blocks you off their profiles, vanishes off the face of the planet. Come on then, who was she? Nobody, just someone I was chatting to online. It's no big deal. Just chatting to online, eh? See, the secret is the angle you hold the phone at. -Adds an extra inch. -Come on! Come on, then. You got her details? I'll check her out from my super user account, see if she's blocked you or deleted her account for good. Age? Location? All right, okay, so... So she's in the 18 to 20 bracket. Fucking legend. She's local, lives in East London. She's not from London, though. She's American. Her name's Atlanta, but she's not from Atlanta. She's from Kansas. Steady on, mate. Don't need her star sign as well. I've got an Amber, an Amanda, an Annunziata, but no Atlantas. Chalk it up to experience, mate. She could've been a catfish or a bot. No way, man. She was... She was real. Come on, there are literally plenty more fish in this particular sea. You know what they say about fish. They're always wet. Couldn't you... I don't know, couldn't you, like, get the tech guys at Futuracom to look up her details or something? Dude, unethical. Illegal. But what if something's happened to her? Wouldn't you then have, like, a duty to investigate? Like what? I don't know, something... Something bad. It's just really out of character for her to delete her profile like that. Are you going to tell me what this is really about? Why this girl in particular is so special? I've got to go. Remember, not a word of this to Candida, right? Hey, babe. You been anywhere exciting? Just to meet Brandon. Did you talk about anything interesting? Continuity errors in the Marvel Extended Universe. So that's a no, then. You look tired, Frankie. How about you and I get into bed? Come on, I've only just got in. Come on, Frankie. Now it really does feel like we're having an affair. Should we be wearing disguises? Since when do you vape? It's blueberry and avocado. It's practically a superfood. I want you do tell me everything you know about... her. Her? The girl that Franklin is fucking. Whoa! He just said they'd been messaging. Yeah, well, there was a video on his phone. The absolute boy. It's not funny, Brandon. I love him. We're probably going to get married and have kids someday. And what, you're taking the moral high ground suddenly? Oh God, I know. You know that I regret everything that happened between us, though, don't you? And now I've somehow gone and pushed Franklin away in the process. I don't have to listen to this. No, wait! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just... You and me, what did you want it to be? Nothing. I mean, you were just a semi-decent bone, that's all. Posh girl with daddy issues and a high sex drive. But it's not like they're hard to find in West London, is it? Who is she? In the video, he calls her Atlanta. Is that her name? That was her username on Smasher before she deactivated her account. It's the only reason he told me anything. Hoped that I would get the office nerds to dox her for him. Can you do that? It would be unethical. And illegal. So what, you want to find her as well? And do what? I don't know, just find her, figure out why he cheated on me, and tell her to stay the fuck away from him so we can all just move on with our lives. No way. We're over, they're over. She stays a ghost. Shit. -Atlanta! -Who the fuck are you? I'm just looking for Atlanta, your flatmate, all right? There's no one called Atlanta here. Get the fuck out or I'm going to call the police. No, no. Please don't do that. Hey, amigo! Get out before I make you. I don't want any trouble. I just want to talk to Atlanta, please. No, mate, you cannot. Yo, I got you on hands free. What's up? It's Atlanta. I think she's in trouble. The girl who ghosted you? Yeah, look, I found the house, but the people there said they'd never heard of her. Or maybe it's just not her house? Maybe, but maybe it's worse. Maybe they've got her locked in the basement or something. And there's something weird with this couple. Dude, we've all come up with some crazy reasons for why a girl won't text back, but the idea that she's been Fritzled is a new one, even for me. Just forget this girl, dude. She's not worth it. No, look, something's wrong. I've got to find her. Why don't you come over? We'll sink a few fruity IPAs. Yep? You got a copy of that video, right? What? I'm not going to send you that. That's private. Seriously? You don't want to share a video of your boyfriend fucking around, in case it violates his privacy? It's not that. It's just, I don't know, you seeing it somehow makes it more real, you know? Look, do you want my help finding this chick or not? Yeah. When we find her, you delete it, okay? I'm hardly going to stick it on PornHub, am I? This is just between us, right? Of course. There he is. Right, so this is the cum dumpster we run through every database we have. Try to ignore the dweeby bloke that sounds like he's got asthma. She's riding him like Spider-Man rides Seabiscuit. She's smashing it like the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep. Taking Picard into warp drive! -Steady on, number one! -Warp! Oh man, her body is kicking it like Hitmonlee. - This is the best bit. - Whoa! Let me drive, will you? On her shoulder. That tattoo. I can run it through Needle Drop. What's Needle Drop? Something Chaucer and I have been working on. It's like facial recognition but for tattoos. Sounds good. Coffee? God, yeah. What time is it? It's late. What time did you get in last night? I don't remember. It's was a big one with Brandon. You know what he's like. Yeah, well, I've got to get to the office, but I won't be home late tonight. What do you fancy for dinner? We could get Thai or Eritrean. I might have to go out. Client thing. Really? Futuracom? How's the logo coming along? It's good, yeah. I think we're really getting there, you know? Okay, well, have fun. Thanks. I'll try not to wake you up when I come in. Thanks. Always thinking of me. Busy as usual? Got to keep up with those online trends, you know? Yeah, right. Anyway, the facial boys. Stop snickering. They've got a bunch of matches. They're sending them over now. Nice work. Completely unethical and illegal work. But yeah, nice. Meanwhile, I ran that tattoo through Needle Drop. -And? -Now, bear in mind, we're still in beta and the database is not as populated as I'd like, but we got a match. Not for the subject, but we got the artist. He posted this pic on his Insta a few months ago. No mention of who the subject is, but he's local. Goes by the name of The Bleeding Cowboy. Sweet. Has he got a shop? No, he's one of those operate out of a squat type of guys, so he gives his deets on a need to know basis only. Okay. Leave it with me. So, you want to tell me what this is actually about? Maybe over dinner and drinks? There's this great new vegan steak place. Dude, I think I'm getting an STI just being in this office with you. Okay. Oh, can you forward me the whole video? There's something I want to check. Maybe I'm not too comfortable with you wanking to my good friend's private sex tape. Just send me the video, dick face. Are you the Cowboy's five o'clock? You're early. Or are you the new girl who booked room six? Yeah. That's me. -What's your name? -Candida. Candy? Original. You're in room six. You've done this before, right? -Yeah, sure. -Sit down. You're making me nervous. You're logged in and set up as Candy. We take 15%, and if you want to keep using the facilities, all we ask is you earn at least 700 tokens per sesh. There's some outfits in the box. You might want to... But I'm sure there's a market for "business MILF"? I wanted to ask, there's this girl, and she's got this tattoo. Might want to narrow it down a bit, babe. It's a sort of bullet, and it's got these-- Look, the cam's live now. You're on the clock. We can spill the tea after, yeah? Your housemate won't mind if we use her bed? No, she moved out. You like what you see? You want me to lose the bra? 200 tokens...from each of you. Hey Candy, your three hours is up. I need you to log off for the next girl and, you know, clean up a bit. Yeah, just give me some privacy, would you? I can't believe you guys started without me. You did good, Candy. Thanks. Cash be okay, or would you rather invoice? Cash is fine. There's something I wanted to ask. I'm looking for this girl, and she has this tattoo, like a bullet, with a butterfly. I remain anonymous. My clients remain anonymous. That's kind of my USP. Well, is she someone that works here? When you come back later, you can maybe make some more dollars. Maybe you'll find what you're looking for. Rough day? Just the usual. What about you? Yeah, same. Just stuck in front of a computer screen all day. Are you really doing this? Right, I am off. Uber's outside. I don't want to lose my five star rating by making him wait. I heard this theory, that what we're afraid of, right, our phobias, they're just things that we died from in a previous life. Franklin, we only get one life. We can't spend it being afraid. Look, I've found the evidence. Some evidence. It's something. Steady on, mate. Great, hand it over to the police. I need more. Could you track her phone or something? Despite what the 5G conspiracy theorists say, we are not the FBI. We make apps. You make apps for the FBI. Fine, look, if you're not going to help me, I'm just going to have to confront them, get them to tell me where she is. Just suppose you are right, and these people are evil sex traffickers. You're hardly Liam fucking Neeson. Yeah, all right, good point. Look, buddy, I've got to go. Just don't do anything stupid. Okay, Coops, this had better be good. I don't think I've ever stayed this late at work, ever. Not even when one of the cleaners gave me a hand job. So, tell me, what's wrong with this picture? It's not our sex tape? Okay, it's my best mate having sex with someone who isn't his girlfriend. That's what's wrong with it. And now the girl's gone missing. Which girl? What do you mean, which girl? Grab me another beer, will you? I'm going to go through this step by step. I didn't think you'd come. So you see, this girl and this girl are two different girls. This one here doesn't even have a tattoo on her shoulder, and this POV shot is a composite. That face, that's our mystery girl's. That body, those tits, someone else's. This whole thing is a deepfake. A deepfake uses AI to construct an artificial image. The possibilities for espionage, cyber crime, and political misuse are endless. Most people just use it to put celebs into porn. So, whose cock is it? We don't have cock recognition tech yet. Give me time. Okay, so the girl whose face it is... Who is that? Insta keeps banning sex workers, so they have, like, 100 profiles under different names, but I think this is her. So Atlanta's a camgirl. Well, whoever she is, your buddy didn't bang her. He's done a pretty good job, but this whole video is fake news. Shit. Safe word's "Toto". You're in good hands now. Do you want the black or the blonde? Or I could go redhead, if you like. We'll go red, shall we? Hi, sugar. Oh, God. You Franklin? Yeah. Is that your real name? Yeah. Absolute amateur waste, man. I'm assuming you're the Jokerman, right? Let's just say some people call me the Jokerman. You got the cash? I fucking love gentrification. You love it too, right? Say yes. Sure. Listen, dumb fuck, don't open it here. The fuck's wrong with you, boy? You okay? Yeah, I think so. That was-- Intense? Yeah, that's kind of the Cowboy's vibe I'm Lucinda, by the way. Can we get a selfie for Instagram? I'm just starting out and I need likes. Are you okay, bro? You look like you haven't slept in a week. Here, get this down you. You said it was urgent. I was just on the way to the house, her house. This better be fucking important. I know. I know, dude. About the video. The video? How? How? It doesn't matter, but I checked out Atlanta's Smashed profile and yours. Same IP address. Okay, so what does that mean? It means it's either some massive prank you're playing on me, or you need help, serious help. This is fucking crazy. Look, she has be real. There's a video, for Christ's sake. The video's a deepfake, dude. There is no Atlanta. You almost had me for a second there. What? So, who else knows about this? Is it just you, or is the whole of fucking Futuracom in on it? And Candida? How did you get her involved? I don't know what's going on. Tell me where she is. I don't know where she is. What the fuck? Is that real? I have no idea, but I just paid 500 pounds to some guy off the dark web for it. Want me to find out? All right, just put the gun down and we'll call Candy and we'll sort it out. Don't try and stop me. Stop you doing what? Rescuing Atlanta. No, no, you stay there. Finish your drink, bro. So what's your story, then? No story. I just need a bit of money to get through uni, you know? As far as the gig economy goes, it's a pretty stable job, so. And you're just totally fine with it? Selling your body? No, selling my time, just like any other job. I mean, until we get fully automated luxury communism, it's what we've got to do, innit? Now you, I bet you've got a story. What is it? Daddy issues? Boarding school girl gone bad? Well, why don't we get a drink and I'll tell you? Alright, listen, uh... -Candy? -Candida. Like the thrush medication? Sure. I'm not here to make friends. Especially not with a tourist. I don't mean to be a bitch but, you know, I'm sure the other girls would be up for hanging out if you've got a bit of coke on you or something. So no drink, no drugs. Do you vape? So, Lucinda. Is that your real name? -No. -How about Atlanta? Yeah, not that either. Though I am fond of that one, sugar. No, each name, it's like a different character, like an avatar for a game that you play online. Don't you ever get lost sometimes? Lose track of who you really are? It's an occupational hazard, but I don't know. I bet you have, like, a different persona for your Insta than you do your LinkedIn. You can't have the mums on Mumsnet finding out about this, can you? I have nothing to hide. Are you sure about that? Anyway, it was nice meeting you and eating your ass, but I've got to go, got uni in the morning. I want you to explain this to me. If you can't work your apps, why don't you just stick with a Nokia? No, this. What the fuck is this? Who's the guy? That's Franklin. My boyfriend. And that's you, isn't it? With his cock in your mouth. It looks like me but no, I've never had sex with this guy. It's on fucking video. Yeah, I don't know what you want me to say to you. It's not me. I've never seen that guy in my fucking life. I'm going to say this once. This ends now! You go near my boyfriend again, and I will fucking kill you! Don't you ever fucking touch me. You heard her. Leave her alone. Franklin. It's okay, Atlanta. You're safe. I'm here to protect you. Does your boyfriend know how to fire a gun? No. Atlanta! You really don't remember me, do you? Mate, I don't know you. Our night together. We had a real connection. We talked about past lives. Look, Franklin. Can I call you Frankie? Yeah? Maybe we had a few cam sessions together, and you, like, subbed to my private Snapchat, yeah? You probably, like, bought my panties off eBay or something. But what we had or did, it was purely transactional. We didn't talk about past lives, and we certainly didn't have sex. I've got a video that says otherwise. You're not fucking helping here. I always knew Brandon was weak, but you? I never thought you'd betray me. And now you. Well, I guess Futuracom got to you all. What the fuck is Futuracom? They own the apps. They own the devices you play the apps on. They own you, and you don't even know their name. You're really not Atlanta, are you? Not my Atlanta. Not real Atlanta. You're just a digital copy. A ghost. Already dead. Franklin. Tell me where the real Atlanta is. Please. Franklin, stop, this is crazy. Crazy? Oh god, I wish I was. But for the first time in my life, I can see everything-- Why don't we take this outside? Who the fuck are you? All you need to know is you're in my house, and these girls are my family. Fuck me. That's a real gun. Somebody call an ambulance! Call the police! Not the police. Get me that diazepam and that gin. You, run! Run! Oh yeah, what do you think of these, love? Oh yeah, suck on these pumpkins. There's a mad cunt with a gun downstairs that just shot the Bleeding Cowboy. -What the fuck? -Shh! Listen. I want to give you a great big pumpkin pie! Hello? The Great Pumpkin's paid a lot of money for this! He's in room four. You need to leave. Hurry up! -Are you coming? -Get the fuck out! Just go! Hello Futuracom. I guess it's come to this. I know you're watching. So, you know what I want. Just tell me where she is. Please don't do this. This isn't you. Atlanta, Lucinda, whatever her name is, she's just some internet slut! She doesn't matter! Do you want me to just let you fucking die? I'm going to count from 10. Ten. Nine. Eight. -Don't do this. -Seven. Six. Five. Hey, sugar. I knew you were real. I'm real. How're you holding up? You know, I've been better, but can't complain. Where are you? I'm close. But first, you need to put down that gun. Put down the gun, Frankie. Give it to Candy. Put down the gun, baby, and then we can be together. Fine. I've done it. Where are you? Room 10, at the end of the corridor. Atlanta? What did you do to him? He tried to kill you. He wouldn't hurt me, not my Frankie! He shot the Cowboy! He had a gun to your fucking head! Let me see him. Let me see him! Candida, put the gun down, okay? It's over. Trust me, it's over. He can't hurt us anymore, okay? Where the fuck did you learn how to shoot like that? I'm from a very posh family. I wasn't sure you'd come. It's Franklin's Transformers comic collection. He'd have wanted you to have it. More than meets the eye. That's Franklin, all right. Yeah, well, that's the last of his stuff from his office. What are you going to use that office for? It'd make a great gaming room. I'm sure I'll think of something. Probably storage. Somewhere to keep my shoes. Did you ever hear from that girl, Atlanta? Or whatever her name was. No, her and the Cowboy cleared out before the police arrived, vanished like ghosts. Don't suppose you fancy going for a drink or something? No pressure, just as friends. Maybe sometime, but not now. I just need some time, you know? Figure out what I'm doing with my life. You and me both. Apparently using Futuracom resources for personal use is both unethical and illegal. Yeah, sorry about that. It's fine. Work was interfering with my video games. Plus, Futuracom are a bunch of bastards anyway. We're getting some impressive results back from the 5G nanotech department. What's the latest on Project Doppelganger? It's performing better than expected. Engagement is tracking above key performance indicators in all quadrants. One test subject used the app to place himself in a pornographic video with an online sex worker. Standard. Has anyone used it for anything else yet? Yeah, yeah. But get this, right? The deepfake was so good that even he believed it was real. Completely messed with his head. Totally fooled his girlfriend, too. Impressive, and what were the key outcomes from this scenario? Um... He's dead. She shot him in the head. Less than optimal. He was an off-books beta tester, though, so no paper trail, don't worry. Okay, well, let's get ready to roll the app out to the public. If people thought faking news was a game changer, wait until they get a load of this. We are going to make an obscene amount of money.
