O'Shea Hey who are you? Your new partner. Tim Randall your... Brett O'Shea. How do you do? What do we know? Well you missed the big speech man the coroner already told everyone time of death based on rigidity somewhere between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. What's the cause. We don't know that yet either? There's no discernable injuries. We got shit from a purse thrown everywhere. There's some cash there but I don't know this doesn't feel like a robbery. Why here? According to her ID she lives right over there. We a uniformed officer check it out. No one's inside nothing seem to be missing we got other guys canvass in the area but don't worry you'll get the report tomorrow. So let's run tox analysis - probably an OD. It's a good idea... standard procedure but hey you got it, Man. Man that wasn't no damn OD! Oh hey hey hey BACK UP! Miss Darcy never dabbled in no shit like that! You know who this is? Yeah... man that's miss Darcy and you know what? She was my friend. Get Back... Calm Down... You see what happened to her? Yeah I saw the whole damn thing... she was running for her life. Sweet child. I tried to help but I got scared Did you she was chasing her. Yep I did. What this person looked like. Man it wasn't no damn person I mean it was a giant ass bird man. A bird? Yeah a big-ass bird. Hold on a second like "KA-KAA KA-KAA" A bird that's what.... get back! Get back! Thank you for your help We appreciate it. If we need anything else we'll be sure to find you okay. Yeah I'll be around but uh is there some kind of you know reward for this here? I mean I did help you all out? Yeah you did yeah I'll tell you what we find a giant bird man we'll put in a good word in the mayor for you. Get back I'm not telling you again... Go on... Well that was interesting. Good morning Chief, you want to see me? You meet your new partner? Any thoughts? I don't really know him yet What's the hollabaloo downtown? Working on that now. Waiting on the coroner's report. Looks like an OD. What do you know about her? She was a known prost, multiple arrests for it. She lived alone. No relationship that we know of yet. Any witnesses? Nothing solid sir. I want you to keep me posted on this. Of course. Something I should know? It's a little too early to tell but this is the second woman found in a week. The first one was found in an abandoned home in Sherman Hills. We have an ID on her? Yeah she was picked up for prostitution last month. Think they're connected? I didn't say that and don't you say it either. I don't want the press crawling up my ass about some serial killer stalking hookers. Yes sir... I want to ask you something. I got a call today from John Allen's office. They say he's been trying to reach you for the last few days. Do you know anything about that. He's called a couple of times left a few messages about meeting. I meant to call him back. Yeah I'm gonna need you to do that... like now. Why the rush? Detective Des Moines likes to pretend that it's a big city but that couldn't be further from the truth. What do you mean? I mean he's a person of influence. The Allen family is very important to our city so if John Allen wants you to call him back you better call him back. Yes sir I'm on it. And one more thing. That had better be coffee in your cup! You smell like a frat house. I left the house in a hurry this morning sir. Got a extra shirt in my office Detective O'Shea please meet me at my home at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning we have something pressing to discuss I look forward to our interlude John Allen Weirdo... Thought you had to work tonight. I did but I took the night off. Oh yeah... why is that? Maybe I wanted to see you. Really? Yeah... don't I go to your head though okay? So there is something that we need to talk about. What is it? So I have a job interview and if I get it it'd be look really great for me. That's all it is? That's great! Well trust me you're gonna do fine in the interview don't worry about. It's in it's in St. Louis. .. St. Louis it's in St. Louis. Yeah. Wow What the hell Lisa? I just I wanted to get your thoughts okay? My thoughts?! I'm shocked I guess. I really thought we had something here. We do okay? You know that we do. I didn't ask for this. oh so someone from from st. Louis just randomly selected you? Hang on a minute a minute. Hey no you know what? I won't hold you back . You decide what you want. This is supposed to be a decision that we make together. I mean hey maybe you could get a job on the force in St. Louis. You know I can't do that. Can you try? I can't just quit and plus I'm the only family my mom has left I can't just leave her by herself. I know... I just had to ask. I don't want to lose it you. Ya know sometimes, things just just aren't meant to be. Guess this is one of them. You... you don't even want to talk about it? I mean if we work together we can make it work right? There's nothing to talk about. You are who you are. I am who I am. We gave it a shot. Just not in the cards. I wish you luck at the interview Lisa. Detective O'Shea so glad you made it... What can the Des Moines police department do for you today mr. Allen? Detective did you know that the state has granted me access to a burial ground of an indigenous Native American tribe? I was unaware. What does that have to do with the police department? Nothing but what I'm about to tell you is very important. And what would that be. My goal was to retrieve artifacts from this site but what I found was a tomb. Well as exciting as that sounds it's not really a police matter. I'm not finished. Our city has a problem detective. Multiple missing-persons... unexplained causes of death. Two weeks ago an entire homeless camp... disappeared. Almost ten people unaccounted for. Then the other night, your case, poor girl in the alley. Tell me, you solved it yet. You know I can't talk about that. You speak to me as if you don't like me. Have I done something to offend you you? You know what I don't like are games and I get the feeling that you do. I don't know what you want but I've had just about enough of this. Why am I here? Because detective, I believe there is a vampire in Des Moines. That's why you brought me here? Don't you see? The tomb. Missing people. And that that tells you we have a vampire? It was one other thing... There is scripture on the tombs. it is Romanian. You really believe this stuff don't you? Why'd you pick me? I chose you Brett because of what you can see. I can't see anything. How is Michael? Get on the floor now! You might not want to go waving that weapon around Sonny, unless you planning on using it. I'm the one given the orders here now you you need to... listen up Sonny we don't have much time. I've come to help you solve the case. Help me what? Let me introduce myself. I'm your great-grandfather detective Michael O'Shea and in case you're still not sure yes I was murdered over 80 years ago... I don't know what you're talking about. Yes I think you do. I've heard things about you. You're a seer. Means you're the only one I can trust. I want you to help me prove I'm right. Mr. Allen I'm sorry but what you're suggesting simply not sane. This isn't about sanity. This is, I'm afraid, a reality. One that I am sure you are well-versed face. Have a good day Mr. Allen Jesus Michael. Odd duck that one is. Can't say that I care for him. Is there any way at all that you can maybe warn me when you show up like that? Oh sure Sonny, maybe next time I'll send you a telegram from the afterlife. That's funny. That's real funny. What are you doing here, huh? More importantly why are you bac k? I figured you'd be dancing through the pearly gates by now. Well forgive me for caring but when I see my great-grandson in despair I feel compelled to step in. I'm not in despair. Well from where I sit things don't look good. Bodies are stacking up. Your best girl is leaving town, you've got a crazy millionaire conjurer vampires. All right all right I get it. O' Shay a word please. Yes sir. I take it you called Alan? As a matter of fact I just left his house and not exactly sure how to say this sir. I prefer English. He's convinced that there's a vampire in Des Moines. Shut the door. What in the hell are you talking about? Apparently he's found a tomb in a dig site. Between that and the missing bodies... lately.... a vampire. Well Jesus in the outfield, he really is nuttier than squirrel crap. I have a feeling something isn't right with him. You think? What I mean is, he seems to know a lot about things that he shouldn't. I told you he's a very influential person. Right I'll write up the report and do the tea ASAP. Sounds good. Be thorough! I don't want this to come back and bite us in the ass later. What's the verdict? Death by Exsanguination. What? It means drained of blood. Yeah I know what it means but why? How? I thought, I thought there were no marks on the body. I know, I know, The coroner misspoke. It looks like two puncture marks on the base of the neck just inside the hairline. Are you shitting me? Yeah. According to her body weight she should have had five liters of blood in her body but she only had one and a half. This is not good. I know. What are you doing here Lisa? Good Morning... I thought I might catch you before work. Can I come in? No. Is there someone in there with you? None of your business and we don't answer to each other anymore. We need to Talk. Nothing could be further from the truth. Brett, you've been drinking again haven't you? Lisa you need to leave. Look I just... Just go please Hey Brett. Brett can I talk to you for a second. Look man this is the second time this week you've shown up smelling like a strip club mop bucket what's going on man? I smell like the strip club? What? Come on man, let this go with the heartfelt apology huh? Hey, the other guys and I we've been here for hours. I'm just telling you it does not look good if you keep showing up late like that all right? I'm just trying to help you out man. How about you just tell me what's going on? Well we don't know anything about blood loss yet but we did find two puncture holes on the base of the neck just like the last one. Park ranger found her. You got no other eyewitnesses. No tracks. She didn't have a cellphone on her and we don't have any surveillance cameras so we got dick. How the hell'd she end up out here. There's no one for miles and miles. How the hell is a tree get all twisted like that? I got a couple theories if you want to hear them. Please. One she was killed somewhere else dumped here postmortem. That's one. What's the other one? This gets crazy... So far we count about six compound fractures not including a nearly crushed skull. What's that tell you? Looks like she was ran over. It's a possibility but her injuries seem to be more consistent with a fall. I don't think she fell. What are you thinking? I think she was dropped. Come in. Shut the door detective. Brett, this is Luther Dennett. He's from the mayor's office.Mayor Winston's office received a call late yesterday afternoon. It was reported that you had words- threatened John Allen in his home. in addition, that you had a very animated argument on the premises with yourself. What do you have to say about that detective? I say that simply is not true. I'll admit that I strongly disagreed with Mr. Allen but I in no way confronted or threatened the man. What about the argument? Honestly I have no idea what he's talking about. Are you sure? I'm pretty sure. Security surveillance cameras recorded footage of you in the car and as you can see it is quite contradictory to what you just stated. Chief Andrews you'll no doubt have a chat with Detective O'Shea? Yeah. I must get going. The Mayor is very much looking forward to updates on all this later today. We shall talk soon. What in the hell are you doing? Sir ... Where were you this morning? You show up to a crime scene an hour after first call? Sir. Shut up Brett. I am sick of your shit. I am ready to bust your ass back down to traffic. Sir. Are you cracking up? What was that shit in the car? And for God's sakes you pick the Allen family to show you ass? I didn't know I was being recorded, Sir. His employee said he saw the whole thing! So even if you're telling the truth now that you've lied about talking to yourself, no one's going to believe you! Jesus I know how bad this looks okay, Go home. What? I said go home! You suspending me? Wow! Maybe you are a detective. Go home. Shave. Iron your goddamn clothes. Dry up and brush your teeth And if I decide to bring you back you show up looking like you belong to the goddamn Des Moines police department. Brett there are no final straws, no second chances, no Mulligan's. You screw up again and you're done. Now get the hell out of here. Well you got yourself a real shite sandwich on your plate now don't you, Sonny? Yeah no thanks to you. My advice... I didn't ask. Well if you're getting it anyway. You know your guts telling you that something unnatural is going on here. I can't be certain of anything. You have seen the facts. Just because a body is drained of blood, doesn't mean there are Romanian vampires. You said the woman was dropped. From what? I don't know. Well you better figure it out Sonny. I'm tryingI O'Shea Well send it to Anders. I'm home for a few days. Thanks for calling. Yeah? Who is this? What can I do for you sir? Thank you for meeting me. That's Alright. Tell me about Darcy. She was a real nice lady. You know? She gave me food, give me cigarettes. How long did you know her? A long time- long time. What's wrong? You see them people over there? Look at me like I'm some kind of rat. You know. Some kind a monster. They don't know I used to be somebody. What'd you do? I play a violin. New York. London. Rome, man world. What happened? I was married and uh my wife died okay and and my son too - it was a car accident. I was I was in Berlin and I had to fly home man cuz I just couldn't concentrate no more you know it's like I couldn't hear the songs in my head you know because all I kept seeing their faces. Im so sorry. That's terrible. Man it's alright it's alright it's alright. See miss Darcy never nood it out with somebody neither but she always treated me like she did. When you called, you said you knew something. Oh right right right. So she told me she met this old cat at the club that she worked at. He had a lot of money to dress nice but she said it was weird but he gave a lot of money so she stuck around. Did she say what he looked like? Mention his name? Yeah. Victor. His name was Victor and he spoke with that accent. Do you think that this Victor guy is the Birdman? I know that for a fact and Miss Darcy did too. You said on the phone you know where he likes to go. Can you take me there? Hell no and I ain't going in there. But miss Darcy did tell me where it is. And you best not go in there alone. I like you sir because you look at me the same way miss Darcy did. Hey mister! What? What are you doing? It's official police business kid now beat it. You ain't no cop. That ain't even real. See a lot of badges in your day kid? No cop comes around here by himself. If you're real cop where's your partner? You ever see anything funny going on around this house? Everything around here is funny dumbass. What I mean is you ever see any people that look like they don't belong? You mean dressed up? Sure. Some nights. late this guy shows up with his lady friends a couple of big boys too. Same women too? Sometimes. sometimes not. You ever hear anything weird coming from here ? I'm done talking. Hey hey someone's in trouble you got to let me know. Sometimes I hear things. What things? Screams... lady screams. Did you ever tell anybody? Nobody hears me. Hey hey I hear you okay? And I'm gonna make it stop. It happens every third night. It'll happen tonight. Then I'll be back. See you later... Sir look. This is not how suspension works O'Shea. I know it just look some information came my way and if it's true it's time-sensitive. You better convinced me with a quickness that you were not working a case while being disciplined. Someone called me and gave me an address. I take it you're talking about this homeless man that keeps calling. Yeah. Well besides the fact that he's insane. I still sent detective Navarro over there. There is nothing to it. Now get out of here. There was a kid. Did you see this kid at the house? Tell me you did not go to that house! Sir look. I don't want to see your face now get out of here before I have you arrested! Hey. What are you doing here Lisa? I came to say goodbye. Good luck! do you not care it all? You'll get it at all do you? If it were up to me you wouldn't go. But all you care about your work so go. But do me a favor and stop coming around here .I don't want to see you anymore. you know what? For the record I never wanted to go without you but you gave up on us so fast. I never gave up. You should have supported me. We could have worked it out together but it's all about you Brett, You know what you're right. I don't care. Good luck. Brett you're an asshole okay! I can't believe you. --Eerie music plays--- Three Gunshots -- BOOM BOOm BOOM -High pitched animal howl!! - Bretts Heavy Breathing-- Brett- What the hell is going here? GET ME OUT OF HERE! Is it still here? I don't Know! Tell me you saw it! Say it! I don't know what I saw. Get some backbone. Shut your mouth. I should lkeave you here for lying about me. I can fix that! You can't fix shit! There have been gunshots. In a few seconds there are gonna be dozens of officers here. Now you just saved my life. You deserve reinstatement effective immediately or your ineptitude is the reason Terrence is gone upstairs you shouldn't even be here. What do you want? I want your word you're gonna help me catch this vampire! If you agree you're back on the force Heralded as a hero here before your head hits the pillow tonight. It's not, stop thinking about your career and start thinking about prison. Why cant you just leave me alone, HUH? Because detective. I know you have a special gift. And we are going to need it if we are going to catch this thing. You'd better hurry! The Mayor made me promise to thank you his behalf and quick thinking. You are a hero detective O'Shea. The mayor's ask that you reinstate the detective immediately. He would like Brett to head the investigation from here on out. Detective you have the complete support of the Mayor and we'd like to extend you any resources you need. Those will be readily available chief Anders. Of course! I suggest you go home and get a few hours of sleep. The city's got a killer on the loose and he needs to be stopped. Prove the mayor right. He's chosen you. Catch this lunatic. Yes sir! Very good. I don't know what you're into but I'm going to be watching you very carefully. Good night sir. You think she'll be back? I'm afraid you have bigger fish to fry now Sonny. What's wrong? That boy that you talked with yesterday. He's been dead for five days. Face it Sonny , I'm not the only man you can talk to I see that you irritated John Allen. Are you trying to cause trouble? Trying to be honest. Allen doesn't like the truth. Well he's calling me now. Sorry. I'll reach out to him. Vampires? I don't think John Allen's elevator goes all the way to the top floor, what do you think? About Allen? No, about socks with sandals, about vampires what do you think about vampires? I want daily reports. -Tense background Music What's all this? I want you to get your crap and leave. I really give a shit what you want. If you have a problem you can take a walk. I've put up with your lies and perverted shit for years. Im not gonna go around pretending that we have a happy and normal marriage. Don't even start with you knew what I liked before we got married. it's just like you! I always give you what you want and never give what I need. I can't stand you. Then LEAVE. I can't afford to leave. You wanted a divorce, you should have thought about that. I talked to a lawyer. He said I'll get the house and half of your pension. Oh you did? Well that's really smart. you should have thought about this... I would never in a million years like you stay here. I'd rather burn this place to the ground. And you know that. That is what I thought you'd say so I recorded it with my cell. You better not touch this house unless its to mow the lawn. ok alright What happened? We can talk about this. What happened? Don't you dare do that. What? Pretend that you are human. Get out NOW! Get out! GET OUT! GO! O'Sheat take a look at this what do you see? We know she is? Ramona Smith, a known prostitute, She usually works the downtown area. What do you think? We should have the coroner's report in a few hours. I'd like you to check this out and keep me updated sir I was under the impression they were already detectives assigned to this case. I decided I'd like your input or do you have better things to do O'Shea? hey, I don't wanna step on anyone's toes that all. You're stepping on my toes right now. Get out there and take a look around see if this looks like anything that you seem lately. Can you handle that? Right away Sir. God... I forgot something I'm sorry I'll be right back. I'll be in the car. Okay. Jesus, what are you doing here? I thought you were upset so I came to check things out what the hell happened to her. That's what I'm trying to figure out. This just happened to other women? Yes. I think Des Moines has another problem. Well I'm one step ahead of you. Call me crazy but I keep going back to Alan's concern and there's a witness claimed it was a bird man. Birdman? Yeah... Are you surprised that all the attention this case is getting I mean she's just a dirty hooker I don't get it Why don't you show a little respect for the dead huh? You know if someone's daughter. Oh come on don't tell me your bleeding heart now. All I'm saying is it doesn't matter what she did to make a living no one deserves to have their throat ripped out like that okay don't need to be a dick about it. Hey cool down I hear you. I forgot you're new at this don't worry we all start off a little self-righteous our first year. I'm not being self-righteous. I'm being human and we don't have a problem as long as you keep your mouth shut Hey you got some nerve talking to me like that buddy. You know respect goes both ways. You know maybe it's not a good idea for you to piss on the guy who's watching your back. Are you threatening me? You take that however you want. A word around the campfire is is you know how to pull the plug off the bottle better than anyone. You know maybe that's how an accident can happen. Don't get too full of yourself there buddy. Morning... I'm Detective Bret O'Shea with the Des Moines police department. I know you were interviewed earlier but thought I'd stop by and introduce myself. See if you thought anything else? I've already given my statement, nothing's changed. Well that was someone else. This is my case now. Think of anything else see anything get ahold of me. You know I'm not surprised there was a murder here. It's get to the point where decent folks can't take a walk at night anymore. When you found the body Did you touch it at all it'll? Make sure it was dead? No, no I did not I almost threw up and I got myself together and I called you guys. See anyone ? Hear a car maybe? Nope. How long have you lived here? 17 years. Why? What about your neighbors, you know them well? No I keep to myself but I watch.. So if someone new came around you know what are you getting at Cop? I'm just trying to determine if you know maybe even you saw something you didn't realize was important. Look you're treating me like a suspect am i a suspect not to my knowledge. Have a good day. Hey wait a minute. You was asking me something and he was getting going on something what is it. Well Ruth I don't think you're telling me everything. I mean there's a tire track in the mud in your front yard. The report says you told officers you got home at midnight last night but you didn't call the police until 12:41 and when the police showed up you were still wearing your work clothes. Well what of it. Well that means you probably hadn't showered yet certainly weren't in bed sleeping. I don't follow. Well that means that you know the body was dropped after you got home and you saw the whole thing or it was here when you got home and for some reason you didn't call the police for 40 minutes. Now which is it? There was nobody in my yard when I got home. Then you must have seen you drop the body. I didn't see shit. Now leave me alone. Oh man you got it right where you want her. Smooth. Hey maybe you should give her a ticket for littering huh huh ? You done? Got a few more ? So what do we got? Well... The wound on her neck similar the past couple of victim's . The body was drained of blood. and we took a skin sample around the wound tested it for animal saliva ,dusted the body for fingerprints, everything came back negative. She had some cuts on her body you made by a sharp object probably a knife. Where does that leave us. Well she died of major blood loss but we don't know who or what made the injury. Whatever ripped her throat out it was sharp and quick and even the lower body he was bitten and mauled and check this out. She wore a ring but it's gone see the tan line. Okay, okay so she's robbed. Well the report says she had almost 200 bucks in her wallet. You know what? We need to go talk to Darlene you know maybe the victim worked for her and we can ask her a few questions. Darlene? Why it's so funny. You're on a first-name basis with the madam of the town brothel. Hey hey... I'm here to speak with Darlene. Oh you want to know the special rate for cops? Special what? No no I want to speak to Darlene. Heather you can leave us. What do you want officer? Detective Brett O'Shea with the Des Moines police department. There was a body found east of here yesterday morning. We think the woman may have spent some time here at some point. Her name was Ramona Smith. Never heard of her. I didn't catch your name. Darlene... Darlene, I think I'm gonna take a look around Darlene. What do you want? detective? Well simply put I'd like some information about a girl that was murdered. Okay I know Ramona. She worked here a while back. She decided she could do better on her own. Happens all the time. She find a pimp? She get a boyfriend? I have no idea. She was a smart girl. She may have changed her mind. Did you get regular customers? How would I know? Well what about one of your regulars? Maybe someone got too rough with her? Maybe someone wanted to hurt her? All Things Considered I run a decent place here. Nobody gets hurt. You men get attention. Women make a living. If you leave your card I'll give you a call if I think of something. Darlene I don't think you understand. I've told you what I know. I'll shut this place down . Give me a name. I haven't one to give. See this business relies on discretion so as a homicide detective. I'm using mine right now to decide if your ass is going to jail or not tonight. I'd offer you some but I know you're on duty. I think I'll take one anyway. What are you gonna do, call the cops? How rude. All right um... There was this guy a while back, he came, and saw Ramona once in a while. All the other girls hated him. He smelled weird. Cologne just weird. What'd he look like. Honestly I never saw him he would always pull up front and Ramona would leave with him and then after a couple of hours a car would drop her off and she'd come in and show off new jewelry. This one time he gave her this huge ass ring. Gold with a big red stone on it. This guy comes back you get a hold of me day or night he understand? Oh he's not coming back here. Ramona was the only one of them go near him. Randall! I thought I told you not to come here anymore. Dammit Randall... What was that all about? Okay I was just talking okay that's all or just talking. yeah yeah it's inappropriate. Makes us all look bad? Oh yeah yeah what was in that flask huh? Don't don't do that I know what you're doing plus you don't know what I'm going through all right? Oh what's that supposed to mean? Look man, my wife's leaving okay. She's taking everything my house. Everything so... Sorry It's all right I don't want to talk about it. I just want to go back to the office. I was just trying to help, Look I don't want to talk about it okay? Let's just go back to the office okay? Okay just get your shit together. Hey Detective. Detective. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah anything wrong? Well I just want to talk asking about if y'all found miss Darcy''s killer yet? Not yet. Hey I'm trying though. I think I seen that bird man again. Where? Downtown Did you actually see anything did that Victor guy you were telling? I don't know cuz I I've never seen that Victor dude before but I'm afraid, man. Well we need to get you off the streets. I can't stay inside no more. Where then? Ain't no place safe. Well let me give you a ride somewhere. No no look... Just find miss Darcy's killer... I don't be scared no more. How are things going with Lisa. You know what Michael? What? I'm getting tired of this shit. Tired of everyone around me being a selfish asshole. I think that's just the way the world is these days. I don't care. You know Lisa was a mistake. My boss thinks I'm crazy. You know my new partners a sociopathic pervert and I got John Allen climbing up my ass every time a mouse farts near him. And you know as I sit here in my house alone I realize I'm not alone at all. I'm visiting with my great-grandfather's ghost. You need to get some rest Sonny you're not gonna find the answers you're looking for at the bottom of that bottle. Yeah well you know good detective will leave nothing to chance so I think I'll finish it just in case.You need to stop drinking so much Sonny and if an Irish meth like me is telling you then it must be true. I don't want your help Michael I want to be left alone. That's not what you need. How would you know what I need huh you weren't even real. You're in my head and I want to stop. You need to listen to me. No you listen to me! I don't want you here okay? I want peace, now get out of here let me think. If someone would have told me what I just told you, I would have lived to be an old man. But I was stubborn. I didn't believe and it got me killed in a basement full of pig shite and piss. I died on the floor alone. Get out! -Eerie Music-- -- A growling gutteral sound from outside... -Creepy music starts again-- --Cell Phone Ringing-- Anders here. Now that's impossible. Check the drawers. So you're telling me that John Allen's bodyguard with his throat ripped out got up and walked out of the morgue? Who's the clerk on duty? No blood at all? Well this is gonna be very difficult to explain to the mayor. Thank you for coming detective. I I hope you don't mind the smoke. Not at all. Try to relax okay? It was about one o'clock this morning I heard a noise and so I looked out my bedroom window and I saw something... What did you see? At first it was this this shadow thing that just flowed from behind the tree. One second it was a shadow and then the second it was it was it was like a man. And the man had this long dark hair and then... It flowed? Yeah. He just stood there right where the body was found and then and then he he looked toward the house and I thought he saw me watching him. Oh God, I was so scared and then when he when he turned toward the house I could see his face I will never forget his eyes I felt his eyes on me... his red eyes. Red eyes? What do you mean? didn't have on like red sunglasses I Red. Fiery red. I know what I saw and we'll never forget it. It's okay. Okay try to calm down alright. You uh you have a place to stay for a few nights? oh I got someone who's coming to stay with me. I just wanted you to know what I saw. Thank you I appreciate it.

Now if he comes around again you get a hold of me. Lock your doors! Randal with you? No. Good. Wanted to stop by before I head to the station. My guard caught a guy watching my house last night. He said he saw this guy hanging around he tapped him on the shoulder the guy turned around and he just stared didn't move a muscle nothing. Did you get a description? Longer dark hair. Oh and he's not from around here. What do you mean like not from Des Moines. No no like not from America. Well what was he doing here? Is he a customer? He was just watching the house, it was creepy.

I don't want to hear you talk I want I want a business now go up to room 8 and I'm warning you right now if there's any problems you're out of here. I don't want it problems okay it's almost fun that's all. Hey can I talk to a second? Sure. I just wanna thank you for helping me. You've been like a big sister. Around here I'm everybody's big sister. Save your money you can't do this forever and when that day comes you can take that savings and you can do something. Go to school or something. I think I want to open a salon, just a little place. Well there you go now there's a plan. Have a good evening Heather. Good night. Be careful out there, watch your back. --Summer night sounds, bugs and stuff. The sound of something flying above... Ominous drums Flying above again... Creepy Music... Deep Growling sound. The growl is behind her.... Babbling brook... Who found her? A truck driver. Hauling sheetrock. He found the body. Where's he at? He's down at the station giving a statement. You speak with him? Yeah you know looks like a kid who watched his puppy get hit by a car. Girl from the other night? Yeah. What's her name? She said her name was Starlight but I think her real name was Heather. Heather? Yeah. What's her last name? When did you last see her? What's with all the questions? Did you see her last night when you're at Darlene's? What is this what you following me now. No you idiot. I was staking the place out I saw you. Okay hey I was off the clock okay? I don't want to hear that. Someone in this city is killing prostitutes. You're the lead detective on the case and when you're off the clock you're banging them? Does that seem like a good idea Randal? Hey who do you think you are huh? Were you with her? Hey hey hey hey back off I don't want to hear it okay? Were you? What'd I just say? You're drunk you don't know what you're talking about so get out of here alright! Come on let's get to work! Jesus. What the hell are you doing? It's middle of the night for me. Found one of your girl's earlier this morning. She was murdered. Who who was it? Heather. What happened to her.Well how was she killed? I don't know anything yet? I just saw her a couple of hours ago. Do you know when Randall last saw her? Last night why are you asking? You know if he was alone with her? Outside of here? I know she was alive when he left I don't know what happened when she went home. Think he would have came back here and hurt her? He threatened her any of your other girls? You think Randall could have killed Heather? Oh god damn son of a bitch I'll cut his nuts off. That's not what I'm saying. I'm only asking questions. Well let me know when we can have her body. We take care of her burial. We bury our own here. Two weeks , no pay, thanks asshole! Hey there's three things you need to know. One, I didn't tell anyone that you pushed me, there were witnesses. - I owe you one buddy and you're gonna get it and three, I know you and Heather were together last night. Hey hey she was fine when I left okay. I never hurt her. Yeah you know Darlene confirmed that however we did stop by late last night after you left Darlene's. We rang the doorbell but no one answered. why I was here I must have been in the shower or something. I didn't see any lights on when I came by. Hey I was here okay I was hear. I even called you. Do you think I'm lying? Is that it? No no what I'm saying is we can't confirm that you were home at the time of the murder. Hey you know that doesn't mean I killed her man come on. It doesn't but you know the drill you're gonna have to come downtown and make an official statement. Why that is bullshit. Why? Because you are with her and at this point your whereabouts can't be verified that's why Randall. You think I kill her. Just say it. I don't know . I don't know this is great. This is just great. First my ex-wife and now this bullshit. Calm down you know what if you're not involved then things will get back to normal. I can't trust you man I can't trust you I can't. Why? Cuz you're nuts. that's why. What the hell are you talking about? You are losing your shit, you're talking to yourself you're completely burned out now you want to bring me down with you man. Just can't. Why do you think that? Who was the other detective that was with you last night? I was alone? No why did you say we? WE came to my house WE rang the doorbell. Is this the same imaginary friend you were talking to in the hallway or outside of John Allen's yep I saw the tape everyone has seen a team man now what's going on? You better get your shit and let's go before we have a serious problem buddy. Yeah? Get it. She was drained like the other victims. Yeah. What's your thoughts on Randall? Do you think he killed that woman? I want to say no chief but I can't he claims he was home not so sure. Well he's gonna be on leave for a while. If you need any help let me know. Hey chief when I was at these crime scenes I couldn't help but notice each one of them had one tree now the vegetation was all lush and green around it but there was one tree at each one and it was dead and mangled You know if you asked me a few days ago I would call you crazy but after looking at these reports these photos and everything that's gone on so far , I don't think we can rule anything out. I mean none of this is looking good Brett. And something came for us. Killed one of our own and then stole a corpse. I'm just as confused as I was the first day I mean who would do this. Well I'm starting to think the real question is what would do this? Honey I I'm a mess I know that okay and I need you okay? Can you please just come over they suspended me today okay? I get it can you please just come over so we can talk? We can work this out. You can't just leave, we can work this out. I'll do whatever you want. Which okay all right I know just give me that chance... please? Hey... What are you doing here, Lisa? I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake. you don' t seem happy to see me. Surprised. That's all. Look I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me. Hey... Why are you here? I had to make sure you were okay. I heard about the murders and I just really worried about you. You know when you left me like that I lost all the feelings I had for you. Can't you understand it I had to try? What did you discover huh was it easy to just forget everything we had? No I want us back the way that we were. It's too late for that I'm moving on and you should too. You made this decision now we both have to live with it. I was wrong. Can't you give us another chance? Come on Come on. I can't trust you anymore. You know I loved you I really loved you and you just pissed it away. I can't go through that again when the next job comes along. What does that even mean? There is a box of your stuff by the front door all right don't forget it on your way out. Okay Brett. you win okay. It's all my fault. I'm gonna leave but before I do know this... You are a spoiled drunk mama's boy and you know deep down in your heart good for you. And together you and I are the best that we're gonna be and do you want to know why? Because we love each other. The sooner you accept my apology sooner we can start living the rest of our lives together. What? Oh you didn't get the memo? It turns out you're mine mister. We are in this for the long haul. okay guess what? I quit my job in st. Louis. I love you I know you love me too okay? Let's stop all this stuff. You have work to do. I have to find a place to stay. Am I getting through to you? Yeah I got a room if you want, till you find something better. No pressure. What's wrong with your room, Cowboy? Little Lamb... Hello? You unearthed the tunnels. You would have been better off the leaving things as they were. What have you done to me? Let me go. Little Lamb... Little Lamb.. Don't be afraid, you're about to see beautiful things. How'd it go yesterday? Still on suspension pending an investigation. Good luck! How's the Birdman case going ? I haven't heard of any killings. You will soon. John Allen's body was found. Looks just like the rest of the murders. This is gonna put the heat on all of us. What are you doing here? Hey I have an alibi okay? Good you're gonna need it. Well just so you know, I'm gonna do something that you can't. What's that? I'm gonna solve this case. You have fun! Good evening chief. What are you doing in my office? What I'm about to tell you is quite unbelievable but I'm afraid you're gonna have to try. You can go ahead and point your weapon at me while we're talking but I promise you it will have no effect on me. And why is that? Your little hamlet has been invaded by vampires. Sadly my great-grandson Brett O'Shea has been taken by them intentions unknown. They've taken him to their den and he needs you. You look pretty good for a man your age as old as you say you are. So you're looking for proof. What if I told you that's your aunt raised you as her own because when you were a wee lad, your mother gave you away, Sadly she had an addiction problem did she knew she couldn't care for you. You never met a real father because she didn't know who he was. My mother died in a car accident when I was six weeks old. Your mother lives. She's in Kentucky. She wishes she could meet you but you already know about because you wanted to find it yourself and you have you just haven't worked up the courage to make the call. So the detective that I hired told you all of this. No chief but if you're still not believing me maybe a way when I tell you where your father is... Think Lisa Think... Lisa. I'm Cheif Anders. I'm here to help him. OK, we need reinforcements or something... We're on our own We need help. Lisa what would you say if I called you and said there were vampires on the loose you would lock me up in a loony bin okay. Don't tell me about vampires an officer has been abducted we need to help him right now. Okay so what 20 men show up prepared to fight what men and then they're slaughtered because they're not prepared for what's inside that building. Okay so what do we do than. u I'm glad you asked... So good to finally meet you I feel I know so much about you. You don't know me at all. Put him in the basement. show him our best hospitality. Holy Crap. It looks like a Walmart Garden Center. What are we gonna do with these? Stab them in the chest! There's holy water too. Okay but how do we know that's even gonna work let's Lets just say I talked to somebody somewhat of an authority on all things dead. Okay that's super creepy. We take out the vampires ASAP take them out one by one I wish we could wait until morning but... Bretts not gonna last that long. So we go on our own. OK... Alright. Master. we've done as you've asked. the men are ready. Very good you all have my orders. Do not fail me. Why so hateful? Are we not both of the netherworld brother? I'm suppose we are but the difference is one of us is a crazy loon. And the other? Oh the other I'm afraid is a blood sucking leech who has no idea his moments in this world are fleeting... You should have just gone away and left us alone. What's the death of you miscreants to you? Where is your soul? You were human once. Is that the best you can do? Oh I have just begun. Brett got a girlfriend. I know you have the girlfriend Brett and I will turn her and when I do you can ask her about her soul. Why don't you just kill me and get it over with. We do great plans for you. I will make you a soldier. I'll never join you. Why not? You'd be quite surprised at the numbers of us would have amongst you. I've turn hundreds. They live all across your country. Seize onto us and I can make you a God. There's no safe place for you on this earth now that I know you're here. Who you think you are? Don't you understand evil isn't winning. Tense Music Hello Gorgeous. Yum Tasty. Not gonna stab me with that little stick of yours are you? Goddammit! LISA?? Hey hey it's me it's me. The detective . I was helping you solve your friend Darcy's murder remember? We are gonna have so much fun. You gotta fight me while tied up why don't you let me out of these huh? Lisa?? What the hell is going on?

Vampires yeah the real now look they took my girlfriend she's in here somewhere and we're gonna find her okay? Give me the gun no it's your guns not gonna do anything I won't they can't get shot what's supposed to do with this in their chest Oh yeah duh. Don't be a smartass Randall. Where is she? I've had enough of you. I've had enough of your friends and this town and the smell of your human. Worried yet? Do not get ahead of yourself detective. I've been a God among man for hundreds of years. I'm unimpressed. We were made to rule over you . You're delusional. You should enjoy your last few moments here on earth. I made a mistake not to kill you before... maybe I let you watch as I turn your girlfriend and to my creation. You won't have the chance to create anything again. You are my biggest regret and my last. I WILL KILL YOU! What's wrong Victor huh , Who are you? I'm Brett immortal guardian you made a huge mistake going up to one of the O'Shea boys! Goodbye Victor. Where have you been? Better late than never Sonny. Tell me this is not why invited me over. I'm gonna finish packing. I'd help but.. She's a good egg. She is the best. How iss Randall doing? He's doing good. I.A. cleared him. He'll be back on duty by the time you get back. Good. Thanks for stopping by. Any time Brett. You just have a good time all right. We will. always a pain in my ass. See you chief don't do anything I wouldn't do. I won't. How's the hand? It's gonna be fine. Are you dry? 11 days. Good on you boy I can see it in your eyes. You okay? I've been called back for a while. I should not have done what I did with Anders and Lisa no one's to know I'm here but you and there would be a price to pay for breaking that rule. Thank God you did. That I put in mention that to it when I see him. So uh what are you thinking of going? Europe maybe Middle East . I'm not really sure. Be careful. All these crazy monsters materializing out of nowhere. I'd hate for you to encounter one when you're in a holiday. Can't come save you Arse you know. Think that could happen? Sonny you have special abilities you haven't discovered yet. I'm a little concerned about what could happen. Wish I knew what these uh superpowers were. I didn't say superpowers. I said special abilities. I'm not worried about it. I should probably go check on Lisa give her a hand. I have to check in today herself, might as well get it over with. Hey before you go, I want you to be the first to know when I asked Lisa to move in with me. Really? Well that's good. I assume you'll be married to her soon then. One step at a time grandpa, one step at a time. Take care of Sonny. Oh my boy. More trouble is coming whether you're ready or not. You best be preparing.
