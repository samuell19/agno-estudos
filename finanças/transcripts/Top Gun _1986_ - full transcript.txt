(JET ENGINE REVVING) (PILOTS CHATTERING OVER RADIO) (CHATTERING ON RADIO) -Morning, Scott. -Morning, Vince. -Morning, Wells. -Morning, sir. Hi. (MONITORS BEEPING) Ghost Rider, this is Strike. We have unknown aircraft. lnbound, Mustang. Your vector, 090 for bogey. Who's up there? Cougar and Merlin and Maverick and Goose. Great. Maverick and Goose. Talk to me, Goose. Roger, I got him. Contact, 20 left at 30 miles. Nine-hundred knots closure. -Cougar, you hear that? -Roger. -Merlin, you got him? -Roger, I've got radar contact. I'll get a visual ID. Cougar, you hook him. Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him. (GOOSE EXCLAIMING) COUGAR: Mustang. Mustang, this is Ghost Rider, 203. I've got him inbound, bogey heading 270. We're at ten miles, 900 knots closure. Ghost Rider, take Angels ten left, 30. Are we supposed to have visitors today? Negative, sir. -Merlin, see if he's a single. -Roger. -Goose, you see a trailer? -Negative, Merlin. Looks like he's a single. Cougar, I'm gonna go head-to-head with him. Take it easy, Maverick. I don't like this shit. I'm gonna break high and right, see if he's really alone. We've got 1,000 knots closure, Mav. He's coming right at us. Okay, buddy, what's on your mind? Holy shit, there's two of them. (GOOSE WHOOPING) GOOSE: MiG-28s. No one's been this close before. What the hell are they doing here? What's the position? Two hundred and fifty miles out, sir. Two hundred and fifty miles? Get them out of here. MAVERICK: Cougar, you've got MiG one. I'm going after MiG two. I lost him in the sun. Shit. What's he doing? You got him, Merlin? He's coming around. He's coming around on our tail. God damn it. This bogey's all over me. What's their range now? Two hundred miles, sir. If they break 150 miles, -launch the Alert Five aircraft. -Yes, sir. Air speed, 300. Go get him, Mav. I'm going for missile lock. Let's see if we can scare this guy out of here. Come on, lock up, baby. Lock up, baby. Lock up. I got him locked. Bingo. (LOCK ALERT BEEPING) We got him, Mav. He's bugging out and going home. Mustang, this is Maverick. MiG two is headed home. All right, what's their position? A hundred and eighty miles at bearing 010, sir. (MISSILE LOCK BEEPING) Cougar, he's got missile lock on us. Get away from this guy. What the hell is this shit? He's engaging me. God damn it, Mustang. This is Ghost Rider, one, one, seven, this bogey's all over me. He's got missile lock on me. Do I have permission to fire? Do not fire until fired upon. Goose, there they are, right below us. The MiG's in perfect firing position. He's right on Cougar's tail. No way, Goose. He'd have fired by now. He's just trying to piss us off. Maverick, get down here and get this asshole off me. Easy, Cougar. Bring it back, hard right. Help me engage. I'm on my way. I can't shoot this son of a bitch. Let's see if we can have a little fun with him. Is this your idea of fun, Mav? Greetings. (MAVERICK LAUGHING) Watch the birdie. Jeez, I crack myself up. This is a great shot, Mav. I should be a photographer. Cougar, your tail is clear. MiG one's bugged out. (COUGAR GASPING) Cougar, this is Maverick. We've had enough fun for one day, don't you think? I'm getting a little low on fuel, so we're heading home. (BREATHING HEAVILY) We'll see you on deck. Cougar, we're running low on gas, we gotta get out of here. (LOW FUEL BEEPING) Cougar. We're on vapour, Cougar. Let's do it. Cougar. Come on, Cougar. MERLIN: Let's take it back to the ship, man. Come on, Cougar. Get him on deck as soon as possible. He's gotta be low on fuel. Cougar, we gotta land this thing. We are way low on gas. You understand me? MERLIN: You all right, man? CONTROL TOWER: Maverick, you're at three-quarters of a mile, call the ball. Roger. Maverick has the ball. -Cougar, it is time to land. Let's do it. -Goose, Cougar's in trouble. Come on, Mav, we're getting low on gas. Let's land this sucker. MERLIN: Cougar! God damn it, Maverick. What're you doing, Mav? We've got no fuel for this. We're going after Cougar. You tell him to land that plane. That's an order. CONTROL TOWER: Ghost Rider, you are instructed to land. Land immediately. Any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here? Mav, we got a little problem up here. That MiG really screwed him up. I don't think he can make it back. (PANTING) You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on my wing, I'll take you all the way in. Just stay with me. Easy, Cougar. Just a walk in the park, buddy. You're a IittIe Iow. You're a little low, Coug. Come on, buddy, pull up. Pull up, Cougar. That's it. Almost there. CONTROL TOWER: Cougar, you're well below glide path, three-quarters of a mile. Call the ball. COUGAR: Roger, ball. MERLIN: We're too low, Cougar. We're too low, Cougar. Increase power. Some more power! Higher! Higher! Higher, damn it! (ENGINE WHIRRING) STINGER: Come in. Sir. Cougar, you should be in sickbay. What's on your mind? My wife and kid, sir. I almost orphaned him today, and I've never even seen him. I don't know what happened up there, but I was so scared. -Come on, we've seen this before. -No, sir. I'm holding on too tight. I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. Cougar. Thanks, Maverick. STINGER: Maverick, Goose, come in here. -What the hell's going on? -I don't know. Shit. Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing. What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. Son, your ego is writing cheques your body can't cash. You've been busted. You lost your qualifications as section leader three times. Put in hack twice by me. With a history of high-speed passes over five air-control towers and one admiral's daughter. Penny Benjamin? And you, asshole. You're lucky to be here. Thank you, sir. And let's not bullshit, Maverick, your family name ain't the best in the Navy. You need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy. Now, what is it with you? Just wanna serve my country, be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir! Don't screw around with me, Maverick. You're a hell of an instinctive pilot. Maybe too good. I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't. I got another problem here. I gotta send somebody from this squadron to Miramar. I gotta do something here. I still can't believe it. I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to Top Gun. For five weeks, you're gonna fly against the best fighter pilots in the world. You were number two, Cougar was number one. Cougar lost it, turned in his wings. You guys are number one. But you remember one thing. You screw up just this much, you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong. Yes, sir! That is all. You can tell me about the MiG some other time. Gentlemen. Good luck, gentlemen. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. (MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING) During Korea, the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1. We shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours. During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1. Our pilots become dependent upon missiles. They had lost some of their dogfighting skills. Now Top Gun was created to teach A.C.M. Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting. This gives me a hard-on. By the end of Vietnam, that ratio was back up to 12-to-1. Don't tease me. Blinds, please. Now I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at Top Gun. The very first man to win the Top Gun trophy. You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world. Commander Mike Metcalf. Callsign, Viper. Gentlemen. You are the top one percent of all naval aviators. The elite. The best of the best. We'll make you better. You'll fly at least two combat missions a day, attend classes in between and evaluations of your performance. Now, on each combat sequence, you're gonna meet a different challenge. Every encounter is gonna be much more difficult. We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14 right to the edge of the envelope, faster than you've ever flown before and more dangerous. Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen. Elected officials, civilians do that. We are the instruments of that policy. And although we're not at war, we must always act as though we are at war. What are you doing? -VIPER: The tip of the spear. . . -I'm just wondering. . . . . .best be sharp. . . .who's the best. In case some of you wonder who the best is, they're up here on this plaque on the wall. The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it. And they have the option to come back here to be Top Gun instructors. You think your name's gonna be on that plaque? Yes, sir. That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in. Yes, sir. I like that in a pilot. Just remember, when it's over out there, we're all on the same team. Gentlemen, this school is about combat. There are no points for second place. Dismissed. Nice going. The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies' room. (SARCASTIC LAUGHING) Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me. You really do. No, no, no, no. There's two O's in "Goose," boys. (DISCO MUSIC PLAYING) Hi. This is what I call a target-rich environment. You live your life between your legs, Mav. Goose, even you could get laid in a place like this. I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me. Mav, you want to know who the best is? That's him. Iceman. That's the way he flies, ice-cold, no mistakes. Just wears you down. You get bored, frustrated, do something stupid, and he's got you. Hey, hey, Slider. Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man. What happened? Goose, you're such a dickhead. Whose butt did you kiss to get in here? Well, the list is long but distinguished. Yeah, well, so is my johnson. -So you're flying with Iceman? -It's Mr Iceman to you. -Hey, Mother Goose. How's it going? -Good, Tom. This is Pete Mitchell. Tom Kazansky. -Congratulations on Top Gun. -Thank you. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He and I were like brothers in flight school. -He was a good man. -Still is a good man. Yeah, that's what I meant. -Thought so. -Say, you need any help? With what? You figured it out yet? What's that? Who's the best pilot. No, I think I can figure that one out on my own. I heard that about you. You like to work alone. Mav, you must've soloed under a lucky star? I mean, first the MiG, and then you guys slide into Cougar's spot. We didn't slide into Cougar's spot. It was ours, okay? Yeah, well, some pilots wait their whole career just to see a MiG up close. Guess you guys are lucky and famous? No, you mean notorious. I'll see you later. You can count on it. They were abused children. -We're gonna have a good time. -Always. (GIRLS WHOOPING) GOOSE: Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it? All right, the bet is $20. -$20. -Right. You have to have carnal knowledge, of a lady this time -on the premises. -On the premises. GOOSE: Come on, Mav. A bet's a bet. I don't know, it just. . . It just doesn't seem fair. For you, I mean. But. . . . . .she's lost that loving feeling. She's lost. . . -No, she hasn't. -Yes, she has. -She has not lost that. . . -Goose, she's lost it. Mav. Come on. I hate it when she does that. Shit. -Excuse me, miss. -Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry, I'll take care of this. (SINGING) You never close your eyes any more When I kiss your lips There's no tenderness Iike before In your fingertips You're trying hard not to show it ALL: Baby But, baby BeIieve me I know it You've lost that loving feeling Whoa, that loving feeling You've lost that loving feeling Now it's gone, gone, gone Whoa, whoa, whoa Ba-doom, ba-doom ba-doom boom boom ba-doom Sit down. Ba-doom ba-doom boom boom Ba-doom, ba-doom... Thank you. Baby, baby I get down on my knees for you Ba-doom, ba-doom Ba-doom boom boom I love that song. I've never seen that approach. If you would only love me... How long have you two been doing this act? Oh, I don't know, since. . . -Puberty? -Right, puberty. -I'm Charlotte Blackwood. -I'm Maverick. Maverick? Did your mother not like you or something? No, it's my callsign. -(GASPS) You're a pilot. -That's right, a naval aviator. Oh. No, actually, we've only done this, twice. Oh, how'd you do? Crashed and burned on the first one. It wasn't pretty. -And second? -I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow. But it's looking good so far. Well, uh, Maverick, my friend's just arrived, so it's been great talking to you. -Perry. -Hi. Hi. Here you go. Oh, I'll be with you in just a second, okay? Listen, can I ask you a personal question? That depends. Are you a good pilot? I can hold my own. Great. Then I won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer. I'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out. Yo! Great, Mav. Real slick. -It was a long cruise, was it, sailor? -It was too long. What did you wanna do, just drop right down on the tile and go for it? No, I actually had. . . Had this counter in mind. Great, that would be very, very comfortable. Yeah. It could be. Actually, I came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy. Really? So I could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself? Maybe. No? I've gotta be at work very early in the morning. Then what are you doing here? Your friend was magnificent. Nah. Nah. JESTER: Now, you'll also be trained and evaluated by a few civilian specialists. The civilians are here because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft. One of the most qualified is our TAGREP, callsign, Charlie. She has a Ph. D. in astrophysics, and she's also a civilian contractor, so you do not salute her. But you better listen to her, because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency. -It's all yours, Charlie. -Thank you. Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s as our MiG simulators. Now, then, as most of you know, the F-5 doesn't have the thrust-to-weight ratio that the MiG-28 has. And it doesn't bleed energy below 300 knots, like the MiG-28. However, the MiG-28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks. It won't do a negative-G pushover. -The latest intelligence. . . -GOOSE: Are you gonna tell her? -. . .tells us that the most it will do. . . -MAVERICK: Nothing. . . .is one negative. . . Excuse me, lieutenant. Is there something wrong? Yes, ma'am, the data on the MiG is inaccurate. How's that, lieutenant? Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28 do. . . We, we. Sorry, Goose. We happened to see a MiG-28 do a four-G negative dive. Where did you see this? That's classified. It's what? MAVERICK: It's classified. I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. CHARLIE: Lieutenant, I have top-secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you. Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so in this case, now, does it? So, lieutenant, where exactly were you? -Well, we. . . -Thank you. . . .started up on his 6 when he pulled through the clouds, and then I moved in above him. Well, if you were directly above him, how could you see him? Because I was inverted. Bullshit. No, he was, man. It was a really great move. He was inverted. You were in a four-G inverted dive with a MiG-28? -Yes, ma'am. -At what range? No. About two metres. It was actually about one and a half, I think. It was one and a half. I've got a great Polaroid of it. He's right there. It must be one and a half. MAVERICK: It was a nice picture. Lieutenant. GOOSE: Thanks, I like my pictures. What were you doing there? (CLEARS THROAT) -Communicating. -Communicating. Keeping up foreign relations. I was, you know, giving him the bird. -You know, the finger. -Yes, I know the finger, Goose. I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry. (SNIGGERING) Excuse me. So you're the one. Yes, ma'am. All right, gentlemen, we have a hop to take. The hard deck on this hop will be 10,000 feet. There'll be no engagement below that. JESTER: Move it! . . .disappear like that. (SIGHING CONTENTEDLY) Lieutenant. Okay, well, don't be late again. -You look great, honey. -Thanks, dear. See you in preflight. Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me that you were a famous MiG insulter? -Would it have made any difference? -Not in the ladies' room, no. And what would've? I'm an instructor at this school. I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks. Now, I'm sure you can figure that out. Look, lieutenant. I'd just really like to hear about the MiG sometime. You've got security clearance. You can read about it. Maverick. I'm curious. Who was covering Cougar while you were showboating with this MiG? Cougar was doing just fine. Uh-huh. JESTER: Gentlemen, this is your first hop. The jets you are flying against are smaller, faster and more manoeuvrable, just like the enemy MiGs. The clock is ticking, and as of now, we are keeping score. I lost him, Goose. Show me what you got, kid. -MAVERICK: I lost him. -I'm looking, I'm looking. I got him, I got him. He's on our tail, coming hard. Yeah, I got him. I got him. Here we go. -All right, talk to me, Goose. -He's still back there. He's closing in on us. He's closing fast. You can run, kid, but you can't hide. Come on, Jester. Let's see if I can give you a run for your money here. Watch the mountains. I still got him. He's still back there. Come on, Mav. Do some of that pilot shit. Yeah, I got him. Come on, bring it right. (TARGET LOCK BEEPING) Goose, I've had about enough of this shit. I'm gonna hit the brakes, he'll fly right by. Okay, you're mine. (WHOOPING) Jesus Christ. (WHOOPING) Let's see what you've got now, Jester. Okay, Mav, let's turn and burn. He's going vertical, so am I. We're going ballistic, Mav. Go get him. He's going for the hard deck. Let's get down there first and nail him, Mav. No way, Jester. You're mine. I got you now. (TARGET LOCK BEEPING) (MAVERICK WHOOPING) Jester's dead. Jester's dead. Get your butts above the hard deck and return to base immediately. Yes, sir. Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby. Negative, Ghost Rider, the pattern is full. No. No, Mav. This is not a good idea. Sorry, Goose but it's time to buzz the tower. (ENGINE ROARING) Goddamn son of a bitch. (GOOSE WHOOPING) (LAUGHING) GOOSE: Great baIIs of fire! (WHOOPING) Jester's dead. You won? That's bullshit. -Didn't everybody? -Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked. Thirty seconds. We went like this, he went like that. I said to Hollywood, "Where'd he go?" Hollywood just said, "Where'd who go?" Yeah, and he's laughing at us, right on the radio. He's laughing at us. No, it's me laughing, dickhead. We won. -All right! -All right! -All right. -GOOSE: All right. They won too, man. That's not what I heard. -No, we did, we got Jester. -No, no. Below the hard deck does not count. Hard deck, my ass. We nailed that son of a bitch. You guys really are cowboys. What's your problem, Kazansky? You're everyone's problem. That's because every time you go up in the air, you're unsafe. I don't like you because you're dangerous. That's right. Iceman. I am dangerous. Maverick. You and Goose get your butts out of that flight gear and up to Viper's office now. Remember, boys, no points for second place. -You're a lot brighter than you look. -Oh, you shut up, okay? -Don't worry. Goose, don't worry. -Okay, I will. Two of your snot-nosed jockeys did a flyby on my tower at over 400 knots! I want somebody's butt. I want it now. I've had it. -Oh ! -God damn it! That's twice. I want some butts! Well, that'll just about cover the flybys. Follow me. Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day. The hard deck for this hop was 10,000 feet. You knew it, you broke it. You followed Commander Heatherly below after he lost sight of you and called no joy. -Why? -Sir! I had Commander Heatherly in my sights. He saw me move in for the kill. He then proceeded below the hard deck. We weren't below 10,000 for more than a few seconds. I had the shot, there was no danger, so I took it. You took it. And broke a major rule of engagement. Then you broke another one with that circus-stunt flyby. (VIPER SIGHING) Lieutenant Mitchell. Top Gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and for that of your team. They are not flexible, nor am I. Either obey them or you're history. Is that clear? Yes, sir! Dismissed. (SIGHING) I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot. Holy shit. (GOOSE SIGHING) Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver. Mav, you have the number of that truck-driving school we saw on TV? Truck Master, I think it is. I might need that. His fitness report says it all. He's a wild card. Flies by the seat of his pants. Completely unpredictable. He got you, didn't he? Yeah. Maverick. I flew with his old man. Tell me one thing. If you had to go into battle, would you want him with you? I don't know. I just don't know. (SIGHING) -You still awake? -Yeah. What's up? Can't sleep. You know, when I first realised that we were going to Top Gun, all I could think about was getting that trophy. I gotta be straight with you, Mav. Right now, I just hope we graduate. I got a family to think about. I can't afford to blow this. Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't such a big hit, huh? Look, man, I know it's tough for you. They wouldn't let you in the academy because you're Duke Mitchell's kid and you have to live with that reputation. But it's like every time we go up there, it's like you're flying against a ghost. It makes me nervous. You're the only family I've got. I'm not gonna let you down. I promise you. Get out of here. (DOOR CLOSING) (SIGHING) A rolling reversal would work well in that situation. But if I reversed on a hard cross, I could immediately go to guns on them. Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast. It's a little bit too aggressive. Too aggressive. Yeah, I guess when I see something, I go right after it. You didn't tell me who you were the other night. You didn't give me a chance, did you? You deserved it. I know. But you were tempted to ask me out for dinner. -No. -No? No. I don't date students. I can see it's dangerous for you. But if the government trusts me, maybe you could. It takes a lot more than just fancy flying. (JET ENGINE ROARING) (WHISTLING) Crash and burn, huh, Mav? Slider, (SNIFFING) you stink. Let's go. SLIDER: Okay, Ice, yeah. GOOSE: All set. MAVERICK: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Back up, back up. Here it comes. GOOSE: That's good. Come on. Let's go, now. (GRUNTING) (WHOOPING) Come on, Mav, let's get them. Those guys are animals. Let's go! Go! SLIDER: Oh, good serve, good serve. (HOWLING) All right! Yes! Yeah ! (GRUNTING) That's game. Okay. Fake block. Stay down. We'll just take them. SLIDER: Okay. Come on, where you guys going? You walking away? We won, we won. Come on ! Mav. Mav. Come on, man. Just one more game. That evens it up. -Come on, we can take them. -No. No, we can, we got it. I got some things I gotta take care of. Take care of? Just one more game. Please? For me? -I'm sorry. -You're sorry. -Come on. -ICE: Come on ! -Mother Goose, you pussy! -For me? (REVVING) Damn it. Lieutenant? -Yeah. . . -What, no singing? -Look, I'm. . . I'm. . . -No apologies. If you don't mind, I'm. . . I'm gonna just take a quick shower while you're finishing up here. Yeah, I do mind. I'm hungry. And then I thought about it. I thought, "You know, Charlie, he's a smart guy. "Why don't you just tell him why you've got him here." Well? It's the MiG. The MiG. You're the only pilot who's been up against a MiG-28. I'm trying for this big promotion at work, and if I get it, I'm not gonna be here much longer. It seems to me you've got it all figured out. Yeah. Except you did forget the wine. Oh. Sorry. You always get what you want? No, not always. Yeah, maybe. Then relax about the MiG. (SITTING ON THE DOCK OF THE BAY PLAYING) This music. An old friend? My folks loved it. I haven't heard this in years. My mother used to call down from her room and have me play this over and over again. I got so sick of it. But not her, she. . . Just sit up there alone, just listening, hours. Just listening. She died shortly after him. What happened to your father? I guess I kind of figured, with your security clearance, you'd know more about him than I do. -Well, I didn't get that far. -Oh. Well, it's a big mystery. He disappeared in an F-4, November 5th, 1965. The stink of it was, he screwed up. No way. My old man was a great fighter pilot. But who the hell knows? It's all classified. Somebody must know. Yeah, somebody knows everything. Is that why you're always second best up there? You are direct, aren't you? I'm sorry I was late. I'm sorry for being direct. No apologies. (TAKE MY BREATH AWAY PLAYING) This is gonna be complicated. Where are you going? I'm gonna take a shower. Thank you. I enjoyed being here. (MOTORBIKE ENGINE STARTING) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) It looks like you need another shower. Right. I'm gonna be honest with you. Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but. . . (CHARLIE SIGHING) I don't normally invite students to my house. You're. . . But. . . Please understand, I still have a job to do. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) -Morning. -Sir. CHARLIE: Morning. I'm glad we got that straight. I told her how tough it is here. You know, my ass dragging like an old, tired dog. I told her that you didn't even have a woman here. Oh, really. You know what she said? Said, "Oh, he probably doesn't have one, "he's got eight." (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (CAROLE SCREAMING) -Hi ! -Daddy! So, Maverick, Goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors. -Is that right? -I didn't tell her that. -Yes, you did. -I. . . -Yes, you did. -I can't believe you said that. -That was a secret. -No. VIPER: The bogey has good position right here. All right, freeze-frame. Moment of choice. The F-14 is defensive. He has a chance to bug out right here. Better to retire and save your aircraft than push a bad position. Charlie, jump in here anytime. Now, you stay in that diamond another three seconds, the bogey's gonna blow you out of the sky. You take a hard right, select zone five, you can extend an escape. You made a bad choice. Charlie. Aircraft one performs a split S? That's the last thing you should do. The MiG's right on your tail. Freeze there, please. The MiG has you in his gunsight. What were you thinking at this point? You don't have time to think up there. If you think, you're dead. Well, that's a big gamble with a $30 million plane, lieutenant. Unfortunately, the gamble worked. The MiG never got a clean shot. Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the top, and he defeats the bandit with a missile shot. The encounter was a victory, but I think that we've shown it as an example of what not to do. Next. Gutsiest move I ever saw, man. Now, then, this is a perfect example of a textbook manoeuvre. Lieutenant. Maverick. Lieutenant. (ENGINE REVVING) Lieutenant. My review of your flight performance in the TACTS was right on, in my professional opinion. I can't hear you. (TYRES SCREECHING) Jesus Christ! And you think I'm reckless! When I fly, I'll have you know that my crew and my plane come first! Well, I'm going to finish my sentence, lieutenant. My review of your flight performance was right on. -Is that right? -That is right. But I held something back. I see some real genius in your flying, Maverick, but I can't say that in there. I was afraid that everyone in that TACTS trailer would see right through me. And I just don't want anyone to know that I've fallen for you. -Hey, Maverick. -Yeah. You hear about Ice? -What's that? -He won another one. -Really? -Yeah. I feel the need, -the need for speed. -The need for speed. JESTER: Gentlemen, this is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple bogies. Your training is half over. The competition for the Top Gun trophy remains tight. First place, Iceman. Second place, Maverick, just two points behind. There they are. Three miles, left, 10 o'clock. I don't think they see us yet. Okay, I see them. Two A-4s, left 10 o'clock level, continue Ieft turn. Good morning, gentlemen. The temperature's 110 degrees. Holy shit, it's Viper. Viper's up here, great. Oh, shit. Great. He's probably saying, "Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose." Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that. I've got my eye on the northern bogey. Roger. I got the southern guy. Hollywood, you've got the lead, I'll cover you. Break now, Jester. Hollywood, we're losing Viper. Let's just stay on Jester. Roger, I'm on him. Goose, find Viper. He's out there somewhere. Stay with Hollywood, Mav, we're covering his wing. MAVERICK: Goose, there's Viper. 3 o'clock, low. Stay with Hollywood, Mav. We're his cover. Don't you leave me, Maverick. Hollywood, you're looking good. I'm going after Viper. God damn you, Maverick. Mav, don't leave him. Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want Viper. Stand by. Viper's coming down. Holy shit, we're head-to-head. I can't believe we're doing this. (WHOOPING) Rock 'n' roll. Here's our chance. It's a big one, Goose. Come on, God damn it. Come on, Mav, keep coming. Okay. Sidewinder missile selected. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come around, come around. That's it, that's it. Jesus, this guy's good. Goose, where's he going? Come on, come on, come on, keep coming. Keep coming! Come on, baby. Damn, this kid's good. He's too close for missiles, Goose, I'm switching to guns. (TARGET LOCK BEEPING) Come on, come on, come on. Stick with me, stick with me. (ALARM BLARING) What. . . Hold it. Goose, check our tail. Shit. There's Jester. Bingo, Maverick's dead. You're out of there, kid. Shit. The Defence Department regrets to inform you that your sons are dead because they were stupid. GOOSE: Great baIIs of fire. Okay, knock it off, gentlemen. Let's go home. Viper has the lead. SLIDER: Thirty seconds, Wolfman, and I'm coming in. Shut up! God, buttnose! That was some of the best flying I've seen yet, right up to the part where you got killed. You never, never leave your wingman. Maverick, (SIGHING) it's not your flying, it's your attitude. The enemy's dangerous, but right now you're worse than the enemy. You're dangerous and foolish. You may not like the guys flying with you, they may not like you, but whose side are you on? Well, at least Viper got Iceman before he got us. We still got a shot at it. That was stupid. I know better than that. It'll never happen again. I know. I know. (SIGHING) GOOSE: (SINGING) You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain Thinking about your love drives a man insane You break my will Oh, what a thrill Goodness gracious, great balls of fire Maverick, would you go fetch him? -Doesn't he ever embarrass you? -Goose? Hell, no. -Well, there was the time. . . -Admiral's daughter. -MAVERICK: What? -Come on. He told me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin. Did he? Well, that's great. -He tells me about all of them, Maverick. -Uh-huh. How my little angel, Goose, goes home early for church, and you, you always go home with the hot women. All right, thank you, Carole. I'm gonna go embarrass myself with Goose for a while. (GOOSE PLAYING PIANO) Dancing ! (WHOOPING) (SINGING) You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain Thinking 'bout your love drives a man insane You broke my will, oh, what a thrill Goodness gracious, great balls of fire I would love to be able to warn you off about Maverick, but I just love him to death. You know, I've known Pete for a lot of years now, and. . . I'm telling you, one thing's for certain. There are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight. Why? Because unless you are a fool, that boy is off the market. He is 100 percent, prime-time in love with you. Hey, Goose, you big stud ! That's me, honey. Take me to bed or lose me forever. Show me the way home, honey. GOOSE: Come on, brother, sing with the family. (GIGGLING) (SINGING) You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain Thinking about your love drives a man insane You broke my will, oh, what a thrill Goodness gracious, great balls of fire (BOTH LAUGHING) Maverick, you big stud, take me to bed or lose me forever. JESTER: Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31. Two weeks to graduation. Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs, so every point counts. (ENGINES ROARING) Well, it's bottom of the ninth, the score is tied. It's time for the big one. You up for this one, Maverick? Just a walk in the park, Kazansky. Contact. Multiple bogies, 165. Two miles. Looks like they're going away from us. Ho, I see them, tallyho, right 2 o'clock. I'm in. I'm in. That son of a bitch cut me off. Come on, come on. Jesus Christ. Ice, take the shot. Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there. I can't get the angle. I'm too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns. Ice, fire or clear. Look at this! Jesus Christ, I can take a shot right here! I need another 20 seconds, then I've got it. I'm moving in. I've got the shot. Come on, Mav, let's get in there! Come on, Mav! Maverick's getting impatient, Ice. Come on, take the shot. Ten more seconds, then I've got him. Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there! Let's do it, Mav. Ice, come off high right. I'm in. -ICE: Five more seconds. -Come off high right, Ice. I'm in. ICE: I'm off. Shit! We're in his jet wash ! Ho! Holy shit! (ALARM BLARING) This is not good. Shit, we got a flameout, Mav. Engine one is out. Engine two is out! Goose, I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I can't control it. It won't recover. Shit. It's coupling up, Mav! We're out of control. This is not good ! This is not good ! ICE: Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble. He's in a flat spin. He's heading out to sea. Altitude 8,000, 7,000. Six. We're at six, Mav. I'm pinned forward, Goose. I can't reach the ejection handle. Goose, you're gonna have to punch us out. I can't reach the ejection handle. -MAVERICK: Eject. -I'm trying ! I'm trying ! MAVERICK: Eject! Eject! Eject! Watch the canopy! Goose! Goose! Oh, no! Oh ! Oh, God ! Oh, God ! Oh, God. Oh. . . (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Oh, God. Sir, let go of him. You gotta let him go, sir. How you doing? I'm all right. -Goose is dead. -I know. You fly jets long enough, something like this happens. He was my RIO, my responsibility. In my squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight of 18 aircraft. Ten men. First one dies, you die too. But there will be others. You can count on it. You gotta let him go. You gotta let him go. (SIGHING) I think maybe it was my fault. Nah. I don't know what the hell went wrong. I'd like to help. I know it's difficult. God, I want him back. (DOOR CLOSING) I'll be here if you need me, okay? (ENGINE STARTING) (SIGHING) God, he loved flying with you, Maverick. (SNIFFING) (SIGHING) (SIGHING) But he'd have flown anyway without you. He'd have hated it, but he would've done it. We find that the F-14 flat spin was induced by the disruption of airflow into the starboard engine. This disruption stalled the engine, which produced enough yaw rate to induce a spin which was unrecoverable. There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could either see or avoid the jet wash which produced the engine stall. Therefore, the board of inquiry finds that Lieutenant Pete Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of 29 July. Lieutenant Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident. Lieutenant Mitchell is restored to flight status without further delay. These proceedings are closed. Get him up flying, soon. Come on, kid, come on. Get in there. Engage. All right, you got a bogey at 2 o'clock low, Maverick. You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal. Take the shot, kid. Take the shot. You can engage any time, Maverick. -Hey, where the hell are you going? -It's not good. It. . . It doesn't look good. What do you mean, it doesn't look good? It doesn't get to look any better than that. Hey, man, we could've had him. Hey, we could've had him, man ! I will fire when I am goddamn good and ready! You got that? He can't get back in the saddle. Won't engage. It's only been a few days. JESTER: You know, he just might not make it back. Keep sending him up. Mitchell. I'm sorry about Goose. Everybody liked him. I'm sorry. Hi, it's Wolfman. Yeah, Maverick just quit. Excuse me. May I? Please. I'll. . . I'll have what he's having. Hemlock, is it? Ice water. (MAVERICK CLEARS THROAT) You weren't gonna say goodbye? I heard you got that job in Washington. -Congratulations. -Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye. Well. . . It's good to see you. Thanks. Where you going? You don't even have a ticket, do you? Listen, I've seen all the evidence, and it's not your responsibility. It's not your fault. You're one of the best pilots in the Navy. What you do up there, it's dangerous. But you've got to go on. No, you don't understand. When I first met you, you were larger than life. Look at you. You're not gonna be happy unless you're going Mach 2 with your hair on fire, you know that. No, it's over. -It's just over. -To be the best of the best means you make mistakes and then you go on. It's just like the rest of us. Oh, you don't think I know that? I'm here to help. Look, thank you. But if I wanted help, really, I would have asked for it. So I'm too late. You've already left. You didn't learn a damn thing, did you? Except to quit. You've got that manoeuvre down real well. So long, Pete Mitchell. Well, hi, Maverick, come on in. -How are you doing? -Good. Really? You sure? You sure you're feeling -okay with everything? -Oh, I feel great. Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink -or anything else like that? -No, thank you. Okay, well, why don't you just. . . -Thank you very much. -. . .make yourself comfortable -because Mike will be right down, okay? -Great, thank you. I flew with your old man. VF-51, the Oriskany. You're a lot like he was. Only better and worse. He was a natural heroic son of a bitch, that one. So he did do it right. Yeah, he did it right. Is that why you fly the way you do? Trying to prove something? Yeah, your old man did it right. What I'm about to tell you is classified. It could end my career. We were in the worst dogfight I ever dreamed of. Bogies like fireflies all over the sky. His F-4 was hit, he was wounded, but he could've made it back. He stayed in it, saved three planes before he bought it. How come I never heard that before? Now, that's not something the State Department tells dependents when the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map. So you were there? I was there. What's on your mind? My options, sir. Simple. First, you've acquired enough points to show up tomorrow and graduate with your Top Gun class. Or you can quit. There'd be no disgrace. That spin was hell. It would've shook me up. So you think I should quit? I didn't say that. The simple fact is, you feel responsible for Goose, and you have a confidence problem. Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, lieutenant. A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's happened. So he can apply what he's learned. Up there, we gotta push it. That's our job. It's your option, lieutenant, all yours. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, but thank you very much for your time. No problem. Good luck. (ALL APPLAUDING) GentIemen... -Where's Maverick? -...here at Top Gun, we challenged you to fly against the very best. I don't know where he is. Now, we ask you to take that expertise... You know what he's planning to do? ...and keep the tradition alive. Gotta be hard on the guy, though, you know? Good Iuck. (DESTINATION UNKNOWN PLAYING) (CHATTERING) -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Congratulations. -Thanks, Mav. Sir. Gentlemen. I hate to break up the party before it really gets out of hand, but there is work to be done. Some of you have to depart immediately. We have a crisis situation. Ice, Slider. Yo. -Hollywood, Wolfman. -Yes, sir. Maverick. Sir. Maverick, you'll get your RIO when you get to the ship. And if you don't, give me a call. I'll fly with you. Sir. STINGER: Gentlemen, this is bull's-eye. The communication ship SS Layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory. A rescue operation is to begin within the hour. Your mission is to give air support to that rescue. There are MiGs in the area, and tensions are high. If you witness a hostile act, you will return fire. Those MiGs carry the Exocet anti-ship missile. They can fire that missile from 100 miles away. Gentlemen, this is the real thing. This is what you've been trained for. You are America's best. Make us proud. -Ice. -Yes, sir. -Hollywood. -Yes, sir. Sector two. And Maverick, you back them up with Merlin on Ready Five. Yes, sir. STINGER: Rise! -Excuse me, sir. -Yes. This is not personal, but with regard to Maverick, is he the best backup that. . . I know what's on your mind, Kazansky, just get on it. (PILOT CHATTERING ON RADIO) (CHATTER ON RADIO) VOODOO 1: Mustang, when you get the chance, can you give me a mode-four check? Voodoo one, you've got a pair of bogies, 12 o'clock, 15 miles. Voodoo one, Voodoo one, 090 radar contact 15 miles. They're doing 500 knots. Roger, that's your bogey. HOLLYWOOD: Got them dead ahead, 15 miles, air speed is 600 knots. Bogies' air speed, 650. We're a little close together. Let's take a wider split. They're at 15,000 feet now, dead ahead, ten miles. Air speed is still increasing. Eight hundred knots. Dead ahead, now, 8 miles. -Dead ahead, now, 8 miles. -Wood, you got them? Not yet, I can't see them. They must be close, I'm getting a hard-on. Okay, Wood, I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them. HOLLYWOOD: Roger, Ice, you got the lead. I'm on your left side, a little low. (MONITOR BEEPING) -Maverick's up and ready in Alert Five. -Good, good. (CHATTER ON RADIO) WOLFMAN: Hollywood, my bogey's still locked up. He's drifting to the left. Still manoeuvring, course 090. SLIDER: Okay, Wood, let's bring it to the right, and we'll get a better angle on them. SLIDER: Ice, we got a problem here. Now I'm breaking out four aircraft on the radar. Not one pair, two pair. Repeat, four bogies. ICE: Wood, we've got four bogies. Wrong ! Make that five! There's five, sir. -That's five? -Yes, sir. HOLLYWOOD: Oh, shit! He's got a radar lock on us!

I'm bringing it around to the left. SLIDER: We got four on our tail ! That makes six of them ! Who do you think is hooking in the guns range? He's firing ! Break right! Mustang, this is Voodoo one, we are totally defensive. Launch the alert fighters. Where? Where are they? A hundred and sixty miles and closing in fast, sir. Ready Willard and Simkin off CATs three and four. Maverick's supersonic. I'll be there in 30 seconds. ICE: Move your ass! Get up here! I'm engaged with five. Repeat, five. I'm in deep shit! What about Willard and Simkin? Both catapults are broken. We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir. -How long? -It'll take ten minutes. Bullshit, ten minutes. This thing will be over in two minutes. Get on it! One MiG, 12 o'clock high ! One MiG, 12 o'clock high ! Watch your back! Watch your back! (ALARM BEEPING) Break right! Shit, that was close!

I've got good tone. I've got tone! I've got tone! Firing ! -Where? Where are they? -A hundred and fifty-five miles. Two MiGs, dead ahead. Closing at 800 miles an hour. I see them. I see them.

How does it feel to be on the front page of every newspaper in the English-speaking world? Even though the other side denies the incident. -Congratulations. -Thank you, sir. They gave you your choice of duty, son. Anything, anywhere. Do you believe that shit? Where do you think you wanna go? I thought of being an instructor, sir. Top Gun? Yes, sir. God help us. (LAUGHING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVING FEELING PLAYING) Hello, Pete Mitchell. I heard the best of the best were gonna be back here, so. . . This could be complicated. You know, on the first one, I crashed and burned. And the second? (CHUCKLING) I don't know, but it's looking good so far.
