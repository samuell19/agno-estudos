I'm Joe Chan, a technical consultant of an electronic media company. I possess many qualifications, job and income... envied by many others. I once thought... that career is everything for a man, until one year ago. I met my girlfriend, Winnie. She totally changed my viewpoint towards life because... she let me know what love is. Love makes me feel comfortable. Since I had Winnie other things are not important anymore. Not yet knock off? I'll be home in about ten minutes. I'm hurrying to record the soccer game for you. Right, the bridal company says the photos will be ready tomorrow. Okay, wait till you knock off. I'll show you something when you arrive home. The leaving of Winnie... makes me think that this world is no longer meaningful. I only realized after she died that I still have lots of things to tell her. I've tried many ways to communicate with her like going for psychic media, crystal ball... but I learn finally... all these are fake. There's only one way to meet Winnie again and I decide to stick to this method. Good morning, Boss! You look good today. I was afraid you won't come to work today. Stop flirting. Hey, is there trouble? I've gone through the contract of PP and the project, it's okay. You only need to sign on it. I've asked a feng shui master to come here and set things up. Just forget the sad past and everything will be fine. Troublesome. Billy, please. Billy, Joe. I want to ask about the insurance policy. Nothing... I want to buy a flat and the bank needs some policy information. Also... I want to make my brother the beneficiary of my insurance policy. Send me the document once the procedures are ready. Make it fast, please. This is Winnie, from Andrew's office. Your secretary is having half day off and we need your signature for some agreements. Your lipstick is distorted. Joe, you're back? Hey, why not rest for a few more days? I'm upset for Winnie's incident. Nothing. Congratulations, you've been promoted to Vice-President. Look at you, we're buddies, stop the politeness. Interested in the 10:00 a.m. meeting? Or you want a rest? The meeting is merely about trivial matters. No, let's go together. Okay, see you at the conference room. Morning, before the meeting begins, let us welcome Joe Chan back here today. Kitty, you may begin. Morning, everybody. As Mr. Chan has just reported for duty, so the first thing for the meeting today will be about the personnel transferring of last week. I think you all know after reading e-mails that starting this month my supervisor, Andrew Tang will be Vice-President of HK district of the company. More than I can bear, why repeat this every morning? Also because Winnie has just died, there've been changes in the office. Say, the secretary department she used to be in charge will be cancelled in future. From now on, every executive will have his own secretary. Mr. Chan, we've arranged for several girls to come for interview these two days. Mr. Chan... Good. Regarding the latest news of the bidding to Pay Channel, let's have my supervisor, Mr. Tang, do the presentation. Thanks. I think you all know that I'm in charge of this project now. I hope you'll support me in full swing. Nelson, some research items in your department are useful to me. Please send them to me. No way. You want to use research items of my department? Joe has just come back and many of the materials still need to be cleared up. In fact, the contract of PP should prove no problem. We can acknowledge it once the pricing is agreed and about the project the center passes on to us... If it can cope with our target, I think that won't be a problem. I'll go over that contract later on. I'll sign it if there's no problem. I think this transaction will contribute 10-12% to the turnover of our company. Nelson. In future, if Andrew needs anything, you'd better cope with him and my approval is not necessary. Okay. Good! The meeting is adjourned if there're no other problems. Dismiss. That Andrew is too much. He thinks he's really top executive. He has already cancelled Winnie's department. I wonder when he'll cut our department. There's vacancy at PA Channel next door. They offer high salary and benefits. Really? - What if we apply for the post? - Good idea. Go and work now. Okay. Two spoonfuls of milk, two spoonfuls of sugar. I've been working late recently. One spoonful of sugar is enough. That Andrew is really dumb! Why didn't you stand against him just then? I don't fear him, I might as well quit any time. I'm having dinner with them, come with us. I've reserved a table already. 7:00 p.m., Fat Angelo, don't forget. It's this one. It's this one. Thanks. I only want to try and see if it has turned stale and not to try that brand. Do you? How come you know? Your ex-boyfriend taught you this? I learnt to teach my boyfriend... What are you doing? You cannot get back money from your former insurance policy. And this one is more flexible. If you like, you can get back money any time and save 10% on interest, look. No need. You can handle it for me. What shall I do without you? It's good you know. May I sing a song for you? Yes, please. Stop... No love, no darling, your head. Go... Are you trying to be ironic? Have you noticed, John, the guy who has just joined? The guy who is really handsome? But he has bad taste with his clothes. Shut up. When I was small... one day... my father suffered a stroke. He remained in coma for about three to four months. Every day, me and my family... went to see him after school or work. We all waited for his death. Finally, one day... my father left us. Though we were all prepared, we were still very miserable. Today, I learn at last... that when your beloved person leaves you, you can't talk to her anymore, though you want to very much. And this is the hardest feeling. After Winnie left me, I told myself that I must take every day... as the very last day of my life. Because if so... I will treasure everything. I'll cherish my friends. I'm lucky indeed because you're beside me. Thanks. Mr. Chan, your girlfriend, Miss Tsang undertook a severe impact at the time of the accident. Besides the many fractures found in her skull, her ribs smashed her lung as well and this caused much internal bleeding. The estimated time of death is 3:00. Doctor, I only want to know if my girlfriend suffered great pain when she died? Mr. Chan, take my condolences. The reasons our company is stronger than other competitors is because we not only offer more than 30 broadband TV channels, but they're provided on internet as well. It means we can serve the Chinese community all over the world. With the help of the latest technology, the audience can also do online shopping while tuning to the TV programs. Damn it, he takes others' design as his invention. Furthermore, our headquarters hope that we can provide them with more details of online purchasing. Nelson, come and help us. No way. I'm in-charge of the ICP project, I have no time. Okay, Kitty, you finish it. Okay. I need more people to help me with the proposal. Jenny, Ivy, come and help me. We cannot, as we're doing the online content right now. No one will update the homepages if we leave. I've put up notice already. Okay, Kitty, recruit someone for me. Okay. Dismiss if there's nothing else. Joe, come here. What do you think about my proposal? Not bad. To collect much capital for the Pay TV, the HQ is thinking of firing staff who get high salary but have low qualification. Fire Nelson of your department. Okay, who else do you want to fire? Fire Ivy and Jenny too. Okay. Whatever you like, anything else? No, go out. Does he know something? You'd better go out now. Fong, you said you'll have a hand-carriage for me at 3:00. It's 3:30 now. No, you must make it today. I'll wait for you, thanks. May I begin? I graduated from Communication Faculty of Baptist University. I've always wanted to work in this company. I've collected lots of information. I know you'll be offering Pay TV soon. Therefore I... I'll tell you a secret. This company will go bankrupt soon. It's my last day here. Okay, go and wait for further notice. Any problem? You haven't asked me anything yet. Danny, Joe. What's going on at your side? A big redundancy is taking place here. Remember Nelson whom I mentioned before? He's very competent. See if you have any position for him. He's a good helper, I want to find him a job. Give him a call next week if there's a vacancy for him. Thanks. Thank you, bye. I'm sorry. It's okay, I may leave now? How's that proposal going on? Almost done. Work hard on it, we have confidence in you. You know, I have 45 days leave. So many days? Why counting your leave? I've quit, I've sent in the resignation letter already. Why quit? I know you fear others think that you rely on me to defeat Andrew. Right, if you're promoted to be Vice-President in future, we'll become opponents, and not as co-operative as now. I quit as I fear you'll run into difficulties. But think over... Is it worth to lose your job for the sake of me? What if I get everything? Everything becomes meaningless without you. But if you quit, we can't often see each other. We needn't meet often if we like each other. In here. Let's get married. Good, when? Right after you finish that proposal. No. No? You won't support my living? Marry me! Danny, thanks. Good, Nelson counts on you now. Right, I also have two girl colleagues. You've seen Ivy and Jenny. Right... See if you have vacancies or good position for them, please. Nothing, I want a leave for travel. Good, thanks. Danny, one more thing. You must take care of yourself. Take care, bye. Not saucer, it's a cheating! It's like playing with saucer board, you're stupid! Hey, why don't you go away? We're playing Angel board. It's like playing with saucer board. I underwent trouble to ask a friend to buy it for me. - Does it work? - Yes! I want to see if I call Winnie with it. Angel, have you arrived? Joe, you may ask now. Angel, what's my girlfriend's name? Okay. How old is my girlfriend? Did I kiss my girlfriend... when I dated her the first time? Bye. Bye. The movie was good. It was. Bye. Remember what you told me the first time? I forgot. Forget it. Your lipstick is distorted. In fact, I meant to come in that day. I know. How come you know? In order to come in to see me, you messed with your lipstick. Don't indulge in this stuff. It won't do you good. Let's go. Joe... I love you and miss you. No one is outside now. Is there situation with Joe's side? No situation for a whole week. If Joe finds evidence against me, I'll be sent to jail. Joe must die. Why was Winnie driving and not Joe? How come I know? I meant to alter Joe's schedule that day so that he could leave early. But Winnie drove his car away. Does anyone know you altered his schedule? No, no one was in the office. Have the police come for you again? Yes, only that time and they haven't come again. I was really scared. It's me who collected information. It's also me who sold information to Cyber E. It's still me who messed up with Joe's car! Why fear? You see, I've fired all people around Joe. After I fix with Joe, this company will belong to me. Just remember to mind your words. Go out and take a look! Kitty. Kitty. What is it? I'm Shing Wai Lin, a taxi driver. For many people, taxi drivers are illiterate guys who don't make much income. Unfortunately, I fit perfectly into this category. But I don't mind. I only need a simple life. Three meals a day and a woman who loves me will suffice. I'm now at the entrance of my girlfriend's building. Things have turned bad recently. She has a new boyfriend. I want to find out how he looks. My friends all say I've been in bad luck recently. People who are in bad luck will encounter unlucky incidents. According to Art. 374 of traffic ordinance, you stopped in a restricted area. You'll be given a parking ticket. Your license. Driver. Get your license back. Drive off at once. I'm going to Japan tomorrow. With your colleagues? Edmond. The main difference between Edmond and you is that he is aggressive. Aggressive. And I need such a man. Grace, can you consider again? No way. Sorry. Your mother has raised you up. You're from a poor family. You have had a woman next to you all these years, but this woman doesn't love you at all. Soon you'll meet a woman. You may get together, but this is a strange woman. Someone is following her. This someone is from hell. You'll run into danger soon. You'll have only two choices. First, leave her, otherwise... How much? No need. Don't come here anymore. Miss. Since you didn't make a noise... Where are you going? Wo Hop Shek Cemetery, please. This scared me. I opened the door and ran away. I failed to shut the door. When I looked back, she flew up. She flew while chasing me. I was so scared that I dropped my cigarette. I ran away very fast. I dashed straight to Wah Ming Estate. At 3:00 a.m., a girl stopped a taxi and wanted to go to Wo Hop Shek Cemetery, so she must either be an idiot or a ghost. And an idiot can't fly? That explains already. - Are you serious? - Bullshit. What's wrong with you? You look as if you were sick? You wear a cap all day... You're bald, and misfortune will surely come. No girl will like you this way. Girls are getting practical now. They want candle light dinner, but you're poor. They want small gifts, but you're poor. They want rave party, but you're poor. You just like an idiot. You have no money for traveling. So no girls will like you. Sister asked me to give you back this stuff. Your love letters, take them back. How is your sister? I don't know. You're her ex-boyfriend, you don't know how she is and I'm only her brother. I rarely see her myself. But frankly, she'll be happier not to be with you. Man, something's wrong. The meter jumps fast. It's really jumped fast. I always take a taxi. No way, I must find a policeman. We must have a talk. Don't drive so fast. Why is your taxi stinking? You'd better wash it before you work! Taxi driver! Car wash? You haven't lowered the flag. Say no more, to police station. Taxi driver, go to whorehouse! Quick! Why drive so slowly? Step on the accelerator! Whorehouse of Portland Street, haven't you been there? Shall I take you there with me? Miss, where to? Take me to Wo Hop Shek Cemetery, please. Grace. Why are you crying? You have quarreled with Edmond? Are you okay? Stop crying. I'll come and see you later on. Are you really okay? Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye. Ex-girlfriend? How come you know? I can tell. You've parted, but you still care for her. You're a nice guy. Why did you part? I'm useless. You always go to Wo Hop Shek at this late hour? Why ask? I know your counterparts have been talking about me. Most of them won't take me there. Why aren't you afraid? I'm not afraid. You needn't take a taxi if you're a ghost. Why do you go to Wo Hop Shek at midnight? To see the grave of someone. Can't you go at day time? Miss, since you're alone here at midnight, aren't you afraid of running into danger? I have an idea. Wait for me here. This... Okay. Young man. Why are you here at this hour? I brought a passenger here to see a grave. No one sees a grave at midnight. No, granny. My passenger has just moved over there. Let's go. Let me tell you. I always have to come to Wo Hop Shek anyway. Can I order your taxi in future? $256, please. Keep the change. Thanks. This is my business card. My phone number is on it. I'm Shing Wai Lin, everyone calls me Shing. I'm Cher, thank you. Good night. I was really upset that night. I really love Edmond, but I feel pressured when I'm with him. He was born in a wealthy family. Even when I take lunch with him, I have to be careful about my attire. Last week... His friends advised me to buy some shares and I suffered a loss of $100,000. I'm not that greedy. I only want Edmond to think I'm competent. I don't want to look useless to him. Shing. I have no ideas. I don't have many friends. I can only turn to you for help. What's wrong with you? You're getting more and more lousy and more stupid too. You say you have something for my sister. What do you mean? You've put an extra zero on it, man? You've parted already. Remember, you have parted already. She has a new boyfriend now. You have no hope, idiot. Declare it a Level 5, Luen, get to the platform. Yes, Sir! Just then over there... did you hear any noise? What noise? Someone seemed to be putting out fire over there. Where do you taxi drivers go if you have spare time? No fixed places. Sometimes for a late supper with counterparts. What about later on? I may go as well. What if you eat with me at my place? Come, eat it. Very nice. My place is messy? Not as messy as my home. A man's home must be messy. Right, how long have you been a taxi driver? About five years. Your own the taxi? Used to be, but I got a mortgage with a bank and I have to pay back every month, not my own taxi now. Why did you get a mortgage? I lent money to my ex-girlfriend. How much can you make in one shift? $700, if I'm lucky. If I'm unlucky, I make no money at all. You don't have stable income. You can get more income by taking me often. Sure. But I don't know how much longer you can take me. Why? You believe in ghosts? I didn't believe in the past. How come? I met a man five years ago. He was a fireman. We had a great time at first, but when time dragged on, we lost that love feeling. I can't let a man who brings me no feeling... to sleep next to me. Not long after I parted with him... he died in a fire. When did that happen? Two months ago. You often go to Wo Hop Shek at midnight to see his grave? People in the paperwork shop tell me, I had better see his grave. I don't know if it'll help. He makes those scars on you? This happens every midnight. "Cher" Thank you. I slept very well last night, it's the first time in the last two weeks. Take a bath now. I'll take you to a place. What is it? Sir, I'm sorry. Is there a woman here who plays Tarot? Tarot? I've lived here for decades, there're no poker cards here. You will meet a woman. You may get together, but this woman is very strange. Someone is following her. This someone is from hell. What exactly is it? I did see a woman that day. Everything was so realistic. What she predicted proved to be accurate. She said I will meet you. So everything is destined. I think I can't pull through longer. There're more and more scars on my body each day. I have tried... to ask friends for help. When they arrived at my home, all they could see is the word Cher. And this scared them so much. I once thought of jumping and killing myself. All he wants is that I die. Shing... I know you're a good guy. I really don't want to harm a good man. Just never mind me. No one can help me. You'd better go away. Don't go home for a few days. You might stay at my place. I'll accompany you! Go home and pack things now. What's wrong with you? How are you? No... Shing... Are you okay? Go away. No! Yung! Yung, enough! Stop it! Yung, I've known you for five years. If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have stayed with you, but you know why I must part with you? Because I find that I'm not the one you love. You only love yourself. All you're doing is possess me. You're too selfish. Look at him, what's he got to do with you? You want to have me only. Want to have me? I promise you, as long as you spare him, I'll jump down and go with you. I'm Mindy Ching, a nurse. I often tell others that there're three advantages with my job. First, I needn't worry about what clothes I should wear at work. Second, it's a sacred job and many boys must come and court us. Third, being a nurse, I can really help those in need. I've moved to live with my aunt who lives near the hospital. Though my aunt has a sharp tongue, she's always pampered me. Her husband left her this flat after he died. But I see Aunt talking to the air lately. She says she always sees the God of Death at home. Whenever God of Death appears, it'll take away someone's life. I don't believe it. There are two tenants in this flat. Uncle Hoi. Never mind him, all his children have emigrated elsewhere and they send money to my aunt every month for his living. Uncle Hoi suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Sometimes he loses his way home and at times, he even forgets who he himself is, but one thing he remembers well. He always remembers his granddaughter, Sandy. I hear that he hasn't seen her for seven years now. There's another tenant. He's a real weirdo. He seldom comes back. Aunt says every time she sees him, he must be drunk or covered in blood. I finally see him today. Why are you coming out from this room? He was wounded when he came back last night. Look after him, I have to hurry to work. I'll wash my face. Aunt Ha. You got chopped up again? Your back has been chopped like a map already. You'll be killed one day if this goes on. Why don't you get a proper job? Right, Aunt Ha. Last night a girl seemed to serve me... Don't bullshit! She's a nice girl. Don't ever take advantage of her. Two egg tarts, please. - Brother Shing, check please. - Coming. - Here. - Thanks. Miss, what would you like to eat? I want to know what that guy bought just now. Fish balls. What does he usually buy? Still fish balls. What else does he buy besides fish balls? Still fish balls. He's a weird man, he eats fish balls all day. Give me a bowl, please. I want one exactly as he eats. Okay, wait a while. Are you using the toilet or not? I need it if you aren't using it. Uncle Hoi, turn around. He can't hear. I think that he can't pull through much longer. Have you informed his children? Already? He has three sons and a daughter. They all have their own family. They're too busy to come back to HK. They only come back here during Chinese New Year. He misses his granddaughter most. And the weird man next door? How come his eyes are so small? He eats nothing but fish balls all day? He sleeps with all clothes on? He's called Ton, he moved here nine months ago. Before that, he was in prison. He's a triad gangster. But he's a nice guy. Please look after him when I'm not at home. Okay. Is it vacant? I'll sit here then. Miss, you again? What would you like? Fish balls, please. Okay, wait. You often get beaten up? I understand, it happens in TV soap series too. Scoundrels hang around are all like this. But being a scoundrel is a proper job? I'm a nurse. Don't you think it's great for a girl who not fears blood? I used to fear blood a lot. But no more, as I'm used to it already. But I remember once... Well, I can never forget. - Fish balls. - Thanks. A 14-year-old boy was sent to Casualty Department. He was all covered in blood. More than 40 knife wounds were found on him. You're quite talkative. There's progress, you gave me a response. Boss. We're eating. Take a seat there, what are you doing? - Your make-up is fading. - None of your business. - Put some make-up on. - You're rude! How is Brother Bill? What can he do? He's lousy and poor. He can but squat aside. I really don't understand you, excuse my frankness. Only you will cover up for him. When you were in prison, he was having a great time, you know? But you asked me to look after him. Otherwise, he... He is a damned fool! Brother Kei called me up. He wants to ask you out to have tea with him. He wants you to help him very much. I know you won't do so, but... You know, he's having good business now and he's willing to pay us lump sum to protect his places. Do consider it, Boss. It'll do you good. I want to ask a favor from you. Can you lend a few thousand bucks to pay the loan shark? A few thousand bucks only. Sure! But you must do one thing for me. I will! - You say so. - Yes, I will! Let's eat. Grandpa. It's a bit thick. Grandpa. Grandpa. Ton. I can't rely on my children anymore. I have $20,000 with me. I think this is enough. And... Here are the addresses and phone numbers of my children. Please inform them for me. Uncle Hoi, don't think so much. Take a rest now. You... You had better find a proper job and look after Aunt Ha, she's aged already. Mindy is a good girl. You must treat her well, you know? Right, say thank you to your friend on my behalf. I'm so happy tonight. Where's Aunt Ha? She's just fallen asleep. She has had much hardship these days. What else do you want to do for Uncle Hoi? Nothing else. Have you thought of the future? You fear you'll step into Uncle Hoi's pace and die all alone? Seeing the way Uncle Hoi suffers now, I dare not think anymore. I remember Uncle Hoi saying he had lots of projects when he was young. Saving, getting married, raising children. What then? He's dead now, and no one is around him. Say, what shall I think of? You mustn't say so. At least he had a granddaughter he missed. Right, why did you become a nurse? Because I needn't worry about what to wear at work. In fact, when I was small, my granny pampered me a lot. Soon she had liver disease and died a few years later. They were very hard days. I was only seven at that time. I couldn't help with anything at all. I could only sit around her and do nothing. Since that time, I felt that when one leaves this world, he needs someone who can ease his pain, so I became a nurse. What about you? Why join the triad? I grew up in public rental housing. I had a pal when I was young. We were really good buddies. Once he and I went for a hold-up and he ran away. I was sent to jail for years. He's having a good time now but he has rivals everywhere. Him being my buddy, I must help him. You're very foolish. You got chopped up, you went to jail for others' sake. When he was 15 years old, he got chopped with 30 wounds for my sake... Have you ever tried to find a job? It seems you have never. Yes, I have. How is it? No one takes me up. "Try this" Going out? Yes. Don't eat all the time. Mindy asks you to follow up and try. She chose it whole night. I've received news that Brother Bill's shipment is revealed. He can neither leave nor stay. Boss, the button is in your hand. Say, "Press" and I'll back you up. If you don't say press, we'll go for massage. How is it? What time tomorrow night? At 8:00 at Sai Kung Pier. We've fallen into a trap. I run into bad luck. I'll arrive tomorrow night. You're going somewhere? You don't want me to go? I don't mean that. But I want you to promise me one thing. Can you come back early after the mission tomorrow night? I want to cook you a dinner. I've never cooked for anyone. Don't turn me down. Can I? Okay. I promise I'll surely come back. Remember. Go away... You've taken one away already, why come again? Brother Bill, I'll arrive at once. Wait for me. Now is the news report. Tonight at 8:00, there was a triad battle at Sai Kung Pier. Two men were chopped up and were certified dead on the way to the hospital. You've really come back as I asked you to? Come, I've just cooked it, come here. Sit down. Is Brother Bill okay? It's good he's okay. Look what I've cooked for you. Fish balls, your favorite food. Curry fish balls, satay fish balls, chiuchow fish balls, homemade squid balls, but the fish balls are not the same. They're all with love, so they're good for your health. Come, try them. Delicious? Very delicious. It's a bit dry like this. I'll get you some soup. Thanks. - Hello? - Ton. Mindy was knocked down by a car. She died two hours ago. Eat with the soup. Don't often eat fish balls from stalls. They put salicylate in, bad for your health. I know it's hard to work outside. But you must be patient. I've bought pajamas for you. I want you to know... a home is here waiting for you. Look after my aunt if you have time. Sorry, I must leave now. You must take good care of yourself from now on. You must cherish yourself too. Got it? There's one thing I want to tell you or you will never know. In fact, I fell for you... the very first time I saw you. Three-four-eight... BB pages and asks if you're going for a snack tonight. Three-four-eight, answer that I'm not going. Thanks. Shing... Where's your position? Tsim Sha Tsui. I'll go home after this round. I've made peanut chicken feet soup. Come and eat it, or I'll finish it all myself. How about tonight? You decide. You have always made the decision. It's a deal. Sister, there's chicken feet soup? May I have some? No way! Didn't you say you'll give me a CD? - Even ten CDs is no problem... - But 12, not ten, it's 12 CDs. Okay, don't worry, no problem. Write it down first. - I guarantee you no problem. - Write it down. Come on, write it down now... Okay, I'll write it down. Write it down immediately! Whatever I say count. - Thanks. - Bye. Thank you. I'm rich, I want to drive. Sell me a car, please. You cocky guy. If you don't show something to the scoundrels then I'll teach them a lesson for you. Forget it. Mr. Chan, your new secretary is here. Your lipstick is distorted. Sorry. Right, Miss Wong. On your application letter, you've left out your hobby. What is your hobby? You love seeing movies? Yes, I love it.
