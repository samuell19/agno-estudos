Sport has a way of really capturing the essence of what's happening in society. 'Racism' is a word that Australians find very hard to deal with. I decided to stand up last night, and I'll continue to stand up. Playing with racial division is dangerous and stupid. There's such an uncomfortable truth in this country, and yet when we speak about it, people don't like it. I believe racism is a community issue which we all need to address, and that's why racism stops with me. You don't want to be the person who stands up and has to fight battles every day of your life. Who wants that? And it takes a huge toll. But it takes a greater toll to walk away. Every action invites a reaction. Sometimes that reaction's gonna be extremely nasty. The force of it was primal. People didn't want to acknowledge what was really happening. He, in the minds of some, had committed the great sin - the black man who complains. I can't speak for what lay in the hearts of the people who booed Adam Goodes, but I can tell you what we heard. We heard a howl. Gotta look ourselves in the mirror here, guys. We've gotta face our demons as Australians. We heard a howl of humiliation that echoes across two centuries of dispossession, injustice, suffering and survival. People are not booing you because you're an Aboriginal. They're booing you 'cause you're acting like a jerk. We heard the howl of the Australian dream, and it said to us again... .."You're not welcome." Welcome to sunny Australia Day. Thousands of proud Aussies have boarded boats and packed the foreshore, celebrating on and around Sydney Harbour. Australians celebrated the big day in true Aussie style. It's pretty good to be an Australian. Happy Australia Day! You know what? We're very lucky to live in this country. No better place to live, really. Every corner of the city marked Australia Day. We're very fortunate. It's an amazing place we live, here in Australia. More than 60,000 people have celebrated here today. It's peaceful. It's prosperous. It's tolerant. It's multicultural. This is a fantastic place! The most dedicated among us have shown plenty of pride as we celebrate our history, our culture and our journey as a nation. Australia Day is Australia's birthday. I mean, celebrating the best country in the world and celebrating the day it was organised. - Having a bloody good time. - Relaxing. - Yeah. - Yeah. This is the day that we celebrate the birth of Australia as you know it now. But to the Indigenous community, that's the saddest day for our culture. Always was, always will be! Aboriginal land! Always was, always will be! Aboriginal land! - Always was, always will be! - Aboriginal land! Dates mark history, but dates don't tell us necessarily about history. It's up to you and I! It's up to every single human being! Ain't the world sick of all the killing?! Ain't the world sick of the government standing over our basic human rights?! We need to put our focus on uniting! Uniting in solidarity! Of caring and sharing for one another! That means we join hands together! Thank you. Crazy turnout today. I think people are getting more and more aware of what this day actually means to Indigenous people and there is a need for change in this country, and it starts with a showing like it is today. How are you doing, brother? I was hoping we'd see you here. I really applaud everybody who turned up here, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. We will march under the banner of Invasion Day. Here we go. One, two, three. Because you are on the pathway to telling the truth of history. And it's when the truth of history is told that we CAN walk together. I just wanted to say you're an inspiration to all Australians. Thanks, mate. Appreciate it. Ever since what happened when I was playing footy, I've only ever felt love from community, love from people. It's great to be able to see those people's faces and hug them back and say thank you, because they're the people that have been fighting for me when people say things about me. So, yeah, it's nice to be able to shake their hands, have some photos and, you know, share the love back. Yeah, which is good. Growing up, I knew I was different. I was darker. I actually didn't know what it meant to be an Indigenous person. I did see myself just like everybody else. It wasn't until high school where bullies, smart-arses would call me names that I then went home and asked my mum, "What does that mean, Mum?" And Mum goes, "Well, you're Aboriginal. "They're trying to tease you. "What I want you to do is whenever they do that, "you just keep walking away." My mum is full-blood Indigenous, my dad is Irish-Scottish, but I've never really been seen as that white person. They've always just seen me as, "You're that black kid." It's a struggle when you're young to be different. I remember when I was a boy, sitting in a bath and trying to rub the colour off my skin, and my mother coming in and asking what I was doing. I'd say, "I'm trying to rub this black off." I found out later that's a really common experience amongst a lot of Aboriginal kids who just want to fit in. We didn't have much as a family. Mum was on her own a lot of the time. When I look back, you realise how tough Mum did do it with three boys on her own. We were very energetic young boys too, so... Mum was strict, that was for sure. She had to be. We moved around quite a fair bit to be closer to other relatives, and then we'd move away from that family just because Mum just thought it would be best for us boys not to be around those environments, which at times were quite toxic. Every barbecue that we went to, there was always lots of alcohol and the adults would always fight, and we'd always see this physical violence happen and, you know, it just became accepted. Our life wasn't the Dreamtime. It wasn't this idea of some pristine Aboriginal existence. It was broken glass and mangy dogs. I think the thing that we have most in common, Adam and I, was that we were having to make our way in the world based on what WE could bring to it. I was such a shy, quiet kid growing up, who really didn't have a voice. It would take a long time to make friends, and then before too long, we'd move away. But one thing that would help us assimilate was our love for sports. My brothers and I, that was the way that we broke down those barriers every time we moved. A soccer ball or a tennis ball or a football, it didn't matter what ball, it would keep us occupied for, you know, hours on end. I grew up playing soccer, but when I moved to Victoria, there wasn't any option to play soccer in this small country town, and that's when I had to try out AFL. Sport in this country really goes to the heart of what the country is, how the country sees itself. But here in Australia, the local home-grown sport of Aussie Rules, or AFL, it's the thread that binds the nation. It's a way of life. It's guttural, it's deep. It's handed down from generation to generation. There is a tribal nature to it. It's freestyle, it's challenging, it's rough-and-tumble, it's courageous and it's skilful at the same time. You know, they've got 'the beautiful game', soccer, you've got rugby, which is 'the game they play in heaven', but as we say, Australian Rules is the game we play here. It's said that the game that we now play was actually an Indigenous game called marngrook. It's something that our ancestors have played for thousands and thousands of years. It's something that's a part of us. Whether we like it or not, it's a part of us just as much as we're a part of it. I compare it to the land, where they say, "We don't own the land. The land owns us." And for some strange reason, I get that feeling with a football in my hand. And a very good morning, everyone. Welcome to the MCG, grand final day 1997, between the North Ballarat Rebels and the Dandenong Stingrays in the TAC Cup for the under-18s. It came naturally to me. My development came very fast. Here's a chance for Clarke, the full-forward. Can't take the ball. Strong work out to Goodes, centre half-forward, in front. He's got it! The first on the board to the Rebels. This guy was an incredible athlete. That was the thing that really jumped out at everyone when he first started. Comes towards Goodes. His snapshot is on target. He's got his second! Adam had a beautiful vertical leap. He could jump from here and, boom, he'd touch the roof. He was a freak. - Goodes flying in! - Good mark! Pow! He was fast. For a big man, his pace was incredible. Goodes on the left foot, the centre half-forward. He's let one go. Look at that! That's incredible! We've got six-goal hero Adam Goodes with us. Adam, how are you feeling, mate? Oh, stuffed. It was just great to win today. Grand final and everything, it was just a good atmosphere. To have the parents here, and everyone just played to their best ability. - It was just unbelievable. - Congratulations. And I think we'll see you in the AFL in the future. All the best. I thought to myself, "This kid's gonna be something special." I didn't know he was gonna become... what he done. I first heard Adam's name in the draft, the AFL draft. Player 3308 - Ballarat Rebels, Adam Goodes. I was sitting at home, and my mother was there and we were both watching, and the name Adam Goodes came out. And Mum goes, "Oh, that's your relation." And I sorta looked at her and I went, "No, you're kidding, Mum. You think we're all related!" And then she proceeded to go through the family tree, and, "That's where he sits in the scheme of things, "and technically speaking, he's your uncle." And I looked at her, I said, "Well, I can guarantee you "I'm not calling this 17-year-old my uncle." And that was it. And I went to the phone box and rang Adam. Got a phone call from Michael O'Loughlin, who was up in Sydney as well. He said, "Welcome to the football club, Goodesy. "Can't wait for you to get up here. "By the way, you're my cousin." So, as scary as it was, I knew that there were people up there waiting for me and excited by me moving up to Sydney. I just can't wait to get up there, but I know I'm gonna be leaving a lot behind, so I have to probably say the cheerios now before I leave and that. My first couple of years at the Swans were a real slap in the face. One week, I'd be the best player in the team and the next week I'd be the worst player in the team. My senior coach, Rodney Eade, he wasn't one to hold back. He could make it very personal at times, the feedback that he could give you. At that particular time, the coach would have seen the talent that Adam had and drove him hard. What you need to realise after a certain period of time is that every personality's different. You know, I might have made the same mistake had I been Adam's first coach, but being his second coach, I realised that Adam's personality didn't lend itself to the negative criticism constantly. It was pointing out what he could do well rather than the things that he couldn't do. What the Swans did in 2003 by appointing Paul Roos was actually giving me a connection to a culture. A culture that I'd been looking for, crying out for. Goodes accelerates away and puts it through for a goal. Goodes! That's a wonderful mark! And one of the things we tried to do with the players was engage them with the past, really to try and connect them to a history. Our heritage goes back to this team in South Melbourne, who they called the Bloodstained Angels. We wanted to tap into this heritage of being the Bloods - hard, disciplined, fight for everything. Goodes! Buying into this culture at this football club definitely filled a void in my life. Identity. Who am I? What do I want to be? Goodes stretches and then goes! Jackhammering it home! We created our own language in this Bloods culture. We had our set of behaviours. We had our elders to look up to. Goodes! Awesome mark! And that's what I absolutely loved and that's what I ate up. They really helped make me who I am. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2003 Brownlow Medal. The Brownlow Medal is the most valuable player of the year award. This is the individual award that every boy dreams of as a kid - that one day you'll be the Brownlow Medallist. Sydney, A. Goodes, two votes. I was lucky enough to be hosting the Brownlow Medal the night he won. What does it mean for you to be a Brownlow Medallist now? I don't know. I really don't know. It hasn't... It's a dream. It is. I can't believe it. And your poor mum who's over there, she still hasn't quite got over the shock of it over there. Lisa, can we ask you, how are you feeling at the moment looking at this son of yours up here? I'm elated. I still can't believe it. Did you give him much chance going into the last round? All the way, bruz. Congratulations, Adam. Great stuff, mate. I had my mum there, who had sacrificed a lot in her life. You could just see how proud she was of me and the role that she'd played getting me there. It just signalled to the football world that Adam had arrived as a player. He said to me, "If I keep working hard, "I can get even better." Which is scary. As soon as I realised that I was one of those Bloods and I deserved to be there, that's when I had aspirations to be an elder, be a leader in that culture. For the first time in 72 years, the Swans are champions of the AFL! The evolution of Adam was interesting to see it firsthand. He was just more comfortable in his own skin and more comfortable with his teammates, more comfortable with coaches. Goodes can do pretty much everything! He just had enormous self-belief and started to cement himself and his reputation as one of the best players in the game. The winner of the 2006 Brownlow Medal is Adam Goodes! There's no duds who win a Brownlow Medal. If you win two, you're a superstar. You're one of the greatest players in the history of the game. You look around the room, see that there's a lot of names on people's lockers, and to get your name on your locker, you have to play at least 100 games, win a premiership, a Brownlow. Goodes on the attack. Sprints away! Look at this! Sensational start from Adam Goodes! I've just got a couple of premierships up there, which is pretty awesome, and then just all that other crap. It's dream time, isn't it? It's that moment that every player wants to experience. Adam was our co-captain at that time, when I first took over in 2011, when Paul left. He was able to pick up pretty quickly that he could influence others. Players need to hear that you've got an opinion and you're prepared to put it out there, because that holds you to account. When you get to a grand final, the adrenaline that's coursing through your veins has you overcoming a lot of physical ailments. But there are some things that just stops people. At the start of the second quarter, I go up for a marking contest. As I go for the mark, the ball then goes over the top. Goodes, a deflection. Jetta. I land on the ground. I'm like, "Ohh!" Right now, Goodes not moving all that well. The physio comes out and goes, "Come off. Come off." So I sort of hobble off to the bench. And Goodes has had some posterior cruciate ligament damage in the past. So, just doing the structural test to make sure he's OK. I look at him, I go, "Is it OK?" And he moves it side to side, he goes, "Your ACL's good." I said, "Yeah, I know. "Is the PCL OK?" He goes, "Nuh. It's ruptured." Obviously quite anxious to know how one of my best players was like at half-time. And I went up to Adam and just said, "How's the knee?" He said, "Oh, it's alright, mate. Don't worry about me." John Longmire's next to me, he's like, "Are you right?" And I said, "Yeah, mate, I'm good." I'm getting some more tape on my knee, he leans over the doctor's shoulder, he goes, "Goodesy, are you OK?" I said, "Yep, I'm good, mate." And just before we run out, he grabs my arm, just as we're about to run out, he goes, "Goodesy, are you OK?" I said, "Horse, I'm fuckin' alright. Leave me alone." He used some pretty strong language to tell me to "move on and don't worry about me". At that particular moment, I knew that he was to be relied upon. I can run in a straight line. I can't change direction and I can't stop very quickly. But I can still play a role for the team. Goodes in a good spot! And, yes, he does! Morton has to fish for it. Still fishing. No-one's got him! And he's hooked a big one! The capacity to be able to continue on is based on, "This is my moment. "I've got to find a way." He still found a way to put the cherry on top of that, which he always does. Well, how about this for a finish? 78 apiece, seven and a half delicious minutes to come. There was only a few minutes to go in the game, and... it was instinctive. Back to Grundy. And then off a step to full-forward. Big flight, Bird. Goodes. Can he roll it through? He can! Cometh the moment, cometh the champion! That to me was the moment that summed him up. Mentally strong, sensing the moment and having the ability to be able to deliver. It is one of the great moments in the history of grand finals. They've done it! What a team! That culture, the Bloods - that's what it's all about! He wasn't able to run until four months later. That gives you some sort of indication how bad that injury was. He got every ounce out of his bones and out of his skin. He did it. He's a champion. And he always will be a champion, Goodesy. Go to any Aboriginal community around Australia and ask them about Adam Goodes, the smile comes to the face straightaway, and there's a sense of pride and they just say, "That bloke's deadly. "He is bloody deadly." Here in Australia, we like to think of ourselves as being egalitarian, but the fact is we're not all the same and we're not treated all the same. Sport's been a huge part of my life and Adam's life. It's given us an opportunity to be able to go and make a better life for our communities and our families. So, it's given us plenty, but, jeez, it's also given us a couple of whacks as well. The first time in AFL when I was racially vilified, I would have been 24, 25. The guy called me "you black, monkey-looking cunt". You can't describe what it does to you when someone says something like that. We should be bigger than that, and you hear that. You know, "sticks and stones", all of that. But, boy, names can REALLY hurt you. You shrivel inside. You shrink. It suffocates you. It strangles you. I remember when I was a boy, when someone would turn and say something - "You black bastard," or "nigger", "Abo", "coon"... ..I wouldn't even know how to respond. You know, what do I do? Do I punch this person? Do I yell? Do I... What do I do? Who do I turn to? And that powerlessness just overwhelms you, it becomes crippling. You just need to ask any Aboriginal person, ask any minority in this country, have they ever been racially vilified, and I guarantee you, they've all got a story to tell. One of the most hurtful things was when I was representing Australia and we were at a camp going on to the world championships. And the Australian team was seated at a table, and a fellow Australian athlete wearing the green and gold said to me, "Pass the salt, nigger." And... no-one said anything. It was dealt with after, behind closed doors, and he said to me, "Oh, I didn't know that that was offensive." Really? The N-word? You did not think that that was offensive? We have our Indigenous camps every two year. We share stories of how we've all been vilified. How one player who just bought a new car got pulled over three times in the same day because they thought that he'd stolen it. Walking into shopping centres and security following you around thinking you're gonna steal something. These are the things that happen every single day to Indigenous people, and it makes us feel like shit and it makes us feel like we're not worthy, that we're not part of the same society that you live in. When I first come to AFL, oh, mate, racism was full-on, don't worry about that. From players, but more so from spectators. The name-calling thing was just bullshit. We played Collingwood at Victoria Park in April of 1993. When me and Nicky walked out, they started giving it to us straightaway. They were calling us everything under the sun. They were calling us Abos. They talk about our people being hung and raping our women. I said to Gilbert, "Did you hear what they were saying "out there before we ran out on the field?" He said, "Yeah, bruz. "Don't worry. We'll fix that on the scoreboard." I said to him, "Bruz, we just gotta play deadly today. "Let's run amok and let's stick it up these mob. "Me and you both get best on ground today." It was very frightening at the time. I can still see it today. I can still hear 'em. Here's McAdam from the boundary line. Tucks it under the arm, sprints into goal. A brilliant player. Oh, that is sensational play, Gilbert McAdam. Oh, here's Winmar. From 60 metres, Nicky Winmar kicks. The brilliant Winmar. And then I was called a "black cunt" and they were gonna kill my family, they were gonna find out where we lived. I just looked around, raised my jumper and pointed to my skin and I said, "I'm black and I'm proud." Yeah, I'm proud of Nick for doing that. There was something incredibly powerful about that moment. Remember the 1968 Olympics - John Carlos and Tommie Smith. That image has lasted a lifetime. That's the Nicky Winmar image for Australia. It's not the black fist in the air, it's the black skin on his body and pointing to it and saying that, "This is who I am." But to be able to stand up, raise your voice, make an example of yourself, it takes a toll. I did go through a lot and I just didn't want to play the game anymore. I was tired of being angry towards other players on the field and... um... ..fighting all that stuff, 'cause it wasn't a part of footy. Welcome back to The Footy Show. The final segment of the night, and we're going west for the 'durby', as they like to say in WA... I meant to go onto the show. I didn't turn up. Nicky Winmar was scheduled to be on The Footy Show tonight. Do you reckon he'll make it, Ed? No, well, we believe that Nicky has disappeared. Sam Newman could be a very crude person sometimes. It's Fremantle versus the West Coast Eagles. Plenty of drama. Sorry I'm late, mate. I'm sorry. When he walked on, he heard me say, "What the hell?" He didn't understand the nuance. He was, you know, a product of those times. He was a '60s, '70s vaudevillian who was sending up Nicky Winmar because he didn't turn up on the show that night. This is as close as we could get. He's not here. Go on, ask me some questions about the Western Bulldogs. I know everything. I know all the players. It's not funny. I thought it was disgusting. The Footy Show racism row between Sam Newman and Nicky Winmar was publicly resolved overnight with the program issuing an unreserved apology. Oh, great. Yep, no, very good. Very happy to, uh... ..uh, have that unanimous document read out, and, uh... so, we're very... very happy. A normal white person in society, they can prove themselves, and then once they've proved themself, they can be accepted. I just want to say, you know, like, I'm just glad that it is all over. If you're a blackfella, you've still got to keep proving yourself. Doesn't matter where you go and what you do, because you're judged as a blackfella. And you're always judged as a blackfella. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. There's a difference between being Aboriginal and knowing what you are and being politicised. Most people don't have that dilemma. They can be who they want to be. Goodesy. But identity for Aboriginal people has always been front and centre. The challenges arise when you become politically aware. As a football club, we wanted all of our players to do some extra study. I was seen as an Indigenous role model, and I actually still didn't really know what it meant to be an Indigenous person. Adam went and studied Aboriginal studies. I was very, very fortunate growing up because it was drummed into me as a young kid, and I forget that Adam missed out on a lot of that. He knew he was Aboriginal, but he didn't know about our culture and our history and what we've gone through. Human occupation in Australia is at least 60,000 years. The oldest continuous surviving culture on Planet Earth. It's remarkable. It gives you goose bumps when you think about that. The more I learned about what it meant to be Aboriginal, the more proud I got of what it meant to be Indigenous, to be Australian. Our people walked this land for thousands of generations before white man arrived, which was only 230-odd years ago. The referendum is on Saturday, and it's important that we should have the maximum vote, because the eyes of the world are on Australia. They are waiting to see whether or not the white Australian will take with him as one people the dark Australian. I was born in 1957, and for the first 10 years of my life, before the referendum, we were not counted in this nation. We only become citizens in 1967. That's the year that I was born. So, that's not long ago. But you've got to remember also that in the Constitution, we're still not recognised as the original people of this country, because of that stupid term 'terra nullius'. The legal doctrine that Australia was claimed by the British of course was terra nullius, which means 'empty land'. "Empty" land? People had been here for 60,000, 70,000 years at least. It wasn't empty! People were standing on the shore as the boats came in. It wasn't empty! When Captain Cook landed and claimed that Australia was terra nullius, he claimed that there was no civilisation living here in Australia. Our land was taken off us. We were raped, murdered, massacred. And this is a day that people celebrate. We don't celebrate the Holocaust. We don't celebrate these moments in history where for one side of the story it's a tragic, tragic story. But we do in Australia. For me, learning about all this stuff just brought up all these emotions inside of me and I was so angry. Suddenly for Adam, here was a history of invasion. Suddenly, here was a history of poisonings, of shootings, of massacres. Here was a history of rounding people up, forcing them onto reserves and missions, separating children, segregating us from the rest of Australia. When you learn the history of this country, it's... it's shocking. Everything about us as a race of people has been denied. Ever since I did my Diploma in Indigenous Studies, gone on my own personal journey about who I am as an Indigenous person, anything that has been said about me, about my Aboriginality derogatory, racist... ..I'm gonna call it out. It's Friday night footy, the beginning of the Indigenous Round. Big night here - it's the Swans and Collingwood. Every year, we have in the AFL Indigenous Round, where we pay tribute and honour the Indigenous players that have come before and are currently playing. This has all been part, I think, of the reconciliation in Australian Rules football to not only look at the talent that is there and celebrate the wonderful champions, but also look at the issues involved in Indigenous Australia and see where we can challenge ourselves. I'm here with Micky O'Loughlin, one of the great Indigenous players of all time. Now, Mick, it's 20 years since this photo was taken, a really iconic Australian football photo - Nicky Winmar at Victoria Park after some taunts from the crowd. Leading into Indigenous Round, it actually was the 20-year anniversary of Nicky Winmar. I did exactly that photo to celebrate, signifying, "You know what? "I'm just as proud as Nicky Winmar "to be black and Indigenous." This photo represents a lot of the sacrifices these guys have made to make the game what it is today. And now we just go out and play footy. We don't have to worry about all the other, I guess, garbage that the guys used to put up with. I always loved the roar of the crowd when you walk out. It was a big part of why I loved playing at the MCG. It was always gonna be a big crowd, especially if it's Friday night football. So, Friday night football about to get under way. The thing about our sport is that the crowd rides every bump, every tackle, every score. As a player, being out here and feeling that emotion from the crowd is fantastic. 400 AFL goals to that man. What a great player he's been. The fans are pretty close, and you want them to be close and to be able to at times feel like they could reach out and touch you. Goodes. He's been so brilliant tonight! What a handball! What a goal! We're having a night out! Just over in that forward pocket is where the incident happened. I just remember running down Collingwood's end and I grab the ball right near the boundary and I get pushed closer to the fence. And I hear from the crowd, "Goodes, you're an ape." Time just sort of stopped in my head. I was like, "Whoa." And I just turned around and I said to the security guard, "I want her out of here." Now, when I looked at the person, I could see it was a kid. Has Adam Goodes had a word to somebody in the crowd, do you think? He definitely went back and pointed at someone in the crowd. Something has happened there. He's definitely not happy about something. I just remember hearing a bit of a ripple through the crowd and wondering what had gone on. A bit going on in the area to which Goodes pointed. And security seem to think they've got their woman. I come off the bench, I sit down, and then it just sort of hits me, the emotion of what she's called me, and I just walked off the ground. I walked down into the medical room underneath and I just burst into tears. So, away from the spotlight at the end of the match, Adam Goodes. That is interesting. And I hadn't been racially abused for eight years, and it just rocked me. You know, I was just trying to take it all in, what had just happened, and I was obviously a little bit emotional. Australia's history was born out of the idea that Aboriginal people were somehow subhuman, less civilised. Lower on the evolutionary scale. So, when someone says "an ape", what's someone like Adam going to hear? "You're subhuman, Adam. "You know? You're not... like us." Even the best of us can be laid low by someone who says something that reminds us where we came from and reminds you who you really are in their eyes. As soon as the game finished, I immediately went into the Sydney Swans' room to speak to Adam personally, to find out what had happened. This is actually where I caught up with Eddie, and that's when he gave me condolences and said, "Whatever happened, we'll make sure "it never happens again at our footy club." We apologised to him that he had to go through something like that, particularly on such a significant night, and that we would be there for him in every step of the way. It was a young kid. That's what freaked everybody out. It was actually a young girl. It would have been easier if it was a drunk, white, 25- to 35-year-old male. But because it was a young girl, it actually created more conversations about, what are we saying in front of our kids? Racism's not born in us. Something put that there. Why would she think that you can use that word towards an Aboriginal person? Adam Goodes has delivered a powerful message denouncing racism after telling how an insult from a young Collingwood supporter left him shattered. I had the absolute privilege of meeting the great man Nicky Winmar two days ago now, and what he was able to do for us 20 years ago, and to be able to make a stand myself and say, you know, "Racism has a face," last night, and, you know, it was a 13-year-old girl, but it's not her fault. All I wanted to get across was racism is unacceptable. But she's a kid. She didn't know what she was saying. She was influenced by others. We needed to support her. The person that needs the most support right now is the little girl. You know, people need to get around her. She's 13. She's uneducated. You know, if she wants to pick up the phone and call me and apologise, I'll take that phone call and I'll have a conversation with that girl about, "You know what? You called me a name. "This is how it made me feel." Adam doesn't condemn the girl. He actually offers sympathy to the girl. He extends a hand to the girl, to talk to the girl. That's what Adam's about. He's about reconciliation. Drawing a line - "I'm not gonna cop this," and then asking afterwards, "How can we move beyond it?" And I decided to stand up last night, and I'll continue to stand up, because, you know, racism has no place in our industry, has no place in society, and hopefully any person out there that's been name-called, has been verbally abused, can stand up for themselves after seeing what happened last night. It concerned me that here was a girl whose face had been shown, broadcast around Australia, and at a subsequent press conference she'd been called by Adam "the face of racism in Australia". And I thought that was really, really unfair on a child. Good evening. A young Collingwood fan at the centre of footy's latest racism storm has phoned Adam Goodes to apologise. The teenager admitted she's ashamed, the slur hurting the Swans champion deeply. I think Adam had good intentions, but I judge it by the result. In the end, an example was being made of a 13-year-old. A regretful 13-year-old trying to repair some of the hurt she's caused. Yep, OK. Sorry for that. Today supported by her mother, the youngster explained why she called the Swans star an "ape". I just kind of meant it as a joke, and then he heard it and then he thought it was, like, racist. The incident also shocked those closest to the teenager. She's only a 13-year-old, young girl that lives in a country town, that... doesn't really get out that much. How is she? It's been a couple of days now. You've had national attention. She's had a really rough time. How is your daughter? She's not doing too bad considering everything that's happened. Do you feel a bit angry about the way she's been treated here? The way she was treated at the ground by the security and the police, yes. It became clear that she'd been taken separately from her grandmother, who was with her at the game, that she'd been detained for a couple of hours, and that she'd been very scared. That's no way to treat a 13-year-old kid, is it? No. No, that's not. If a child of 13 abused you in the street, are you going to drag them off to the police, threaten them, then call a press conference, show their face to the world? Make them infamous in their own town and school? Would you do that, or would you think, "Ooh, no, that's a bit unfair"? You notice Adam Goodes said she was "the face of racism". Did that concern you? She's only a 13-year-old, little girl, and this has really been taken way out of proportion. Joanne Looney, who is the mother of Julia, the child in the middle of this. You can't let your ideology, your race politics, your wish to improve things get in the way of the fact you're dealing with a girl. You owe her something. Unfortunately, people wanted to focus on Adam being a bully and picking on a 13-year-old girl, and it was turned around really quickly. The feedback that I was getting on my social media - Twitter in particular - was, "Toughen up, Goodes," "She's only a young girl." And then they would post pictures of me and an ape - "Well, actually, you do look like an ape." And this was just constant. G'day, people. It's your favourite ranter, Mr Anderson. OK, we're doing a rant on Adam Goodes. Adam Goodes is the Sydney Swans football player that basically went out of his way to kick out a 13-year-old girl for calling him an "ape". Yes, this man is an Aboriginal, but I hate to tell you, you ARE an ape. We all descend from apes, you fucking moron. And I hope everyone calls you a fucking ape at every fucking game, because, you know, what you did was over the line, mate. You do not kick out a kid from a football game, alright? I guarantee you, you've heard worse fucking slurs than that. An "ape". Seriously, you're a fucking soft-cock. Get thicker skin, you idiot. And from now on, Adam Goodes, you're known as a fucking ape. The backlash just intensified and intensified to the point where it actually really surprised me that people had those points of view and said those things about me. The whole message that I tried to get across is that we need to talk about this. And we didn't have to wait too long until that conversation actually started again. Live across the greatest city known to man, this is the Triple M Hot Breakfast. Now the man who really knows Melbourne and just about everyone in it - Eddie McGuire. Football's racism row has erupted again after bizarre comments from Collingwood president Eddie McGuire. Speaking on breakfast radio, McGuire linked footballer Adam Goodes with King Kong just days after Goodes was hurt by a teenager's insult during a Swans match at the MCG. Hang on a minute. This is the guy who four nights earlier is shaking my hand, saying, "This is unacceptable," but he's on radio making a joke about King Kong - a gorilla - and me. It was just a mistake. It was a misspoken moment. I had run myself into the ground a bit that week, I was exhausted, and the night before, I was actually out hosting a symposium to raise money to try and help Indigenous boys and girls come to private schools. It's a very disappointing moment for me to be sitting here today. I made a slip-of-the-tongue remark this morning that was actually the opposite of what I was thinking at the time. But what went to air went to air, and it's as simple as that. I was trying to make the point that in the old days there were variety shows in Australia, the black-and-white minstrels, etc, where this would have been set up as satire, and I was trying to make that point and I completely stuffed up what I was trying to say. I've spoken to Adam Goodes today, who again showed the class that he has to accept my call, to listen to my reasonings and to take on board what I had to say. When I finally took his call, I just said, "You're not a friend." He just forgot where he was. He forgot that he was on radio, and it was just an off-the-cuff thing that he would say at a barbecue, at a bar, and it just highlighted my point - that casual racism is there, it's alive and it's flourishing in our communities. I don't understand the question. What does that mean? No, it's not. I wasn't racially vilifying anyone this morning. I don't think Eddie's being racial at all. I think it was just like he said - a slip of the tongue and it was a bit of a joke. I don't think either of these comments were being deliberately racist. I think we're getting a little bit thin-skinned. It's just something that came out. Anybody could have said it. Innocent mistake, then, you think, Shirley? Oh, absolutely, yes. I don't think most Australians know... ..what the big deal is. I don't think they understand what is racist and what isn't. Why was it so obviously racist, in your view? Because he indicated earlier really he felt it was just a slip of the tongue. What's the difference? All sorts of remarks are made in everyday conversation which indicate that a lot of us don't understand where the line of racism is drawn. Can you be racist if you don't intend to be racist? It is possible for people who are not necessarily racist to make racist statements, and they make them out of ignorance. People think because it's casual and because it happens everywhere and because we do it in our backyard barbecues and because it happens in the schoolyard and because it happens at work, it's just a joke. You know, have a bit of a laugh. But, again, it comes back to that much deeper thing of not understanding the impact of that on people that have to hear it. People couch the question of racism from the perspective of the person uttering the words rather than the perspective of the person to whom the words were directed. Some of the comments I've just heard presuppose that we need a policy of national clairvoyance to understand exactly how a comment is going to be heard. People just don't have a perspective of the reality of the situation. And unless you've been there yourself, you'll never, never know, because you'll never, never go. Because you're not black. Growing up, we didn't really know how we were Indigenous or what that actually meant. People said, "Are you Aboriginal?" I was like, "Yeah, I am. I'm from Adnyamathanha tribe." But that's all I knew. And that's all I think my mum knew. She couldn't really pass anything on to us children about us being Indigenous or where we came from. Long time no see, eh? When I started to ask questions about the past, I started to notice that she'd clam up and she didn't want to talk about it. I just knew that she was taken away and that we had a white nanna for some reason. So I was very surprised when we filmed Who Do You Think You Are? and my mum relived what happened to her. I've got a couple of photos to show you, honey. This is your grandfather Hurtle. And this one is your nanna, my mum, Daphne. Aw. That's an awesome picture. Yeah. It's a nice photo of her. I can see myself in her. I know I'm Indigenous, but I don't know nothing about my ancestors. - The same as you, yeah. - Yeah. Cool. - Be nice to know, eh? - Yeah. The idea was that Aboriginal people would die out. There was a phrase that was widely used - "to smooth the dying pillow". People were being sent off to reserves and missions where, effectively, they would disappear. But of course, we didn't disappear. The problem of Aboriginal welfare today is not primarily one of ministering to primitive, nomadic tribesmen living well away from the centres of civilisation. The main task is set by those who are losing touch with their Aboriginal way of life and have not yet been fully received into the Australian community. Governments tried to develop policy to deal with what was seen as 'the Aboriginal problem'. And one of the ideas was assimilation. But it's with the children that the real hope for assimilation lies. Their education should be intended not merely to fulfil the normal educational requirements, but also to fit them for taking their place in society. You were five, weren't you, when... Yep, about five, going on six, yeah. Oh, that would have been a very traumatic time, Mama, to be taken away. It was. The day they took us away, the only thing I can remember - I was stripped down, scrubbed with a scrubbing brush, and they shaved all my hair off my head. Absolutely terrified. And I was under the bed singing out, "Mum! Mum! Mum!" And, um... Yeah. It's sad, isn't it, Mama? Sharon came under the bed with me and cuddled me. That was gut-wrenching to hear my mum tell that story and break down in front of me. Part of that policy was to take children from families, take them off into children's homes, where they would be educated and then sent out to work for white families. They would marry potentially white people and have white kids, who would eventually be absorbed into the Commonwealth. There's an incredible picture used at the time as a way of explaining the assimilation policy - a dark grandmother, her slightly lighter daughter and her daughter's blond-haired son. I can't imagine what it's like not to have known Nanna. Quite a nice-looking couple, aren't they? They're very nice, yeah. My mum and my grandparents were all members of the Stolen Generation. There's nothing greater than a mother's love for her own children, and you protect them. Adam's mum, like my mum, didn't want to burden him with what she endured during her time. That's an effect that the Stolen Generation had on our people. When we found out about what had happened, I had a different perspective on my father as to why he might have drank a bit more or did this and that. I had a bit more clear picture of what... You know, I put everything together and then I realised why. My mum actually, at this point in time, is up in Sydney, getting some help for her trauma. Mum was very strong bringing us kids up, 'cause she didn't want to lose us, and, like, she was taken from her parents, so... And I think once we all left, um, it sort of... ..you know, had this, um... ..she didn't have to be strong anymore, and... yeah. Yeah, she's still dealing with it. The removal of Aboriginal children, the abuse that those children endured, whether it was physical, mental, it transcended. And it's hard not to inherit the pain. It's in our DNA, it's in our blood, that we are who we are because of those who have gone before us. The biggest lesson I learnt from doing that show was the story of survival and wanting to survive and wanting something better for our children, the next generation. And that to me is, you know, why I do the things that I do. Good job, Mama. There's a whole generation that's an educated generation of Aboriginal people who are saying, "We've got an inherent responsibility "and we're gonna talk about the past, "we're gonna talk about the intergenerational trauma "that's passed down. "We're gonna talk about the pain "of our mothers' and grandmothers' sufferings, "and white Australia need to hear the truth." The Australian of the Year... The Australian of the Year... Your Australian of the Year... Since 1960, the Australian of the Year Awards have recognised great Australians from all walks of life. Most Australians would know Adam Goodes as one of the great champions of Australian Rules football. But Adam is far more than just a sportsman. He's an extraordinary Australian who has committed himself to some of the toughest social issues that we face. I met Adam when we were actually filming the Australian of the Year Awards. I was the producer for the TV show. In my 16 years as a professional athlete, I've learnt about my deficiencies, the things that I needed to improve on. I've also learnt a lot about myself - who I am and where I come from. A lot of this goes back to my identity of being a very proud Aboriginal man. He spoke with passion and conviction and just an honesty that you can't deny, and you couldn't deny, having heard it. The honour of being named Australian of the Year, it was something that I had to think about. Australia Day doesn't sit very well with me. But the reason why I decided to go and accept it was it would be a fantastic platform to talk about racism on a national level. Ladies and gentlemen, the 2014 Australian of the Year, Adam Goodes! Thank you, Australia, for this award. It is a huge honour. It's an honour to receive an award for doing stuff that you love and what you believe in. Growing up as an Indigenous Australian, I have seen and experienced my fair share of racism. Whilst it has been difficult a lot of the time, it has also taught me a lot and shaped my values and what I believe in today. His speech was beautiful. He used that opportunity to tell the whole of Australia who Adam Goodes was. I believe racism is a community issue which we all need to address, and that's why racism stops with me. In a way, it's the greatest expression of patriotism, to say, "I believe in my country so much, "and when my country fails me, I have to confront it. "I will stand up to make my country better." It is not just about taking responsibility for your own actions, but speaking to your mates when they make racist remarks. I'm so glad he said that. See how he stuck up for his people? It wasn't about him, was it, about getting the Australia Day award? I'm not here to tell you what to think or how to act or raise your children. All I'm here to do is tell you about my experiences and hope you choose to be aware of your actions and interactions, so that together we can eliminate racism. Thank you so much and have a great Australia Day. It's just quite amazing, to be honest. It's taken me a long time to get to the point of actually celebrating Indigenous culture and heritage on this weekend. There are a lot of Aboriginal people out there that do think back, "What if 225 years ago we were never colonised?" These are thoughts and pain and sorrow that Aboriginal people go through. I'm so proud to be Australian. This award is such a huge honour. And on Australia Day, for me, you know, it IS - it is Invasion Day, it is Survival Day. It's all of those things to Aboriginal people, and I think people need to understand today is a day of sorrow, of hurt. Yes, bad things were done 200 years ago, but we're asked to feel guilt for something none of our ancestors did to people long dead. Andrew Bolt has slammed footballer Adam Goodes, claiming he's already let us down as Australian of the Year. For him to truly express who he was as an Indigenous Australian man and not just be playing football like he was 'supposed to do', I think that made people uncomfortable. As Australian of the Year, I have often spoken about the fact that our country's Constitution still closes its eyes to the long part of the Australian story that predates British arrival. The problem that Adam had was that the response he got was one of disagreement to the way he was having the conversation. It's a warning to us all where the policies of racial division could end up. Every action invites a reaction. Sometimes that reaction's gonna be extremely nasty. It was grand final day in 2014. Goodes is down there, and takes the mark! Runs around, and he's kicked his second. Stuff was just happening in the crowd. And then the next season, it started again, and I was just like, "Really? Are we still doing this?" Goodes. And they're pantomime kind of boos. It's a little bit of fun, and hopefully, it's taken in that context. Back in the old days, if you got booed, you wore it as a badge of honour. You knew you were doing really well. And Goodes getting some boos, but he'd be used to that. But he was getting booed for going near the ball. And you're just left there scratching your head. The booing was there for Goodes again. Every time he kicked a goal, it was massive. The boos have been getting louder every time he steps on the field. It escalated week on week. He couldn't ignore it. It was at a level that was clearly affecting Adam. It is something that you hear. Whether it bothers you or not, that's up to each individual. Clearly, he's frustrated by the treatment he's getting. It is clear that it is taking a toll on Goodes. Adam was really upset. He knew why it was happening. You'd like to think that people would respect how long you've played for, what you've given to the game, causes that you've supported. But they obviously didn't like what I was saying, and loud and clearly, they were letting me know. Adam's no different to anyone else. All anyone ever wants is to be seen for who you are and respected for who you are. And when you don't get that, that can be the most hurtful, debilitating response to get. "What does that mean "of the lifetime's work that I've put in?" And we all respond when we feel like we haven't been seen or we haven't been acknowledged or we've been hurt. Mitchell off a step. Didn't look pretty. But Goodes is able to cut across and take the mark. I could hear the Carlton supporters booing me as I was lining up. My instincts just took over. Goodes pops it through. You've been geeing me up all day with the booing, and this war cry was just perfect. When I saw him do that, I thought, "Well, that's aggressive." That's the response of a bloke who feels like he hasn't been acknowledged for who he is and he's shown, "Hey, this is who I am." But it wasn't gonna get a great response from people who couldn't see that that came from a position of hurt. Mate, we saw you with the celebration in the second quarter there after the goal. Can you talk us through that? Yeah, just a little bit inspired from the under-16 Boomerang kids, who taught us a little bit of a war cry. So, just a little tribute to those guys. It wasn't a reaction to anything untoward tonight at all? Nah, not at all, mate. Indigenous Round, proud to be Aboriginal and representing. I felt immense pride when he did it. I love watching the replay of that. My son practises the same moves in the mirror. And I can guarantee you there'll be another 100,000 young little Aboriginal boys and girls doing the same thing in the mirror. It was awesome. I thought he left a couple of good moves out. Former Australian of the Year Adam Goodes has sparked a social media storm, performing an Aboriginal war cry during last night's Sydney win over Carlton. The war cry certainly stirred up Blues fans, many hurling abuse at the man who has become the most booed player in the game. There was nothing untowards to the Carlton supporters. It's actually something for them to stand up and go, "Yep, cool, we see you, we acknowledge you. Bring it on." It caused a stir on social media, with Goodes likely to cop more abuse from fans in the coming weeks. Why do you feel you're such a polarising character in the game of football? Is that what you think? Obviously, people have got, you know, divided opinions on your character and what... People have got divided opinions about everything. The mimicking of a throwing of a spear at someone, I think it's pretty unmistakable what that gesture is... ..and I don't think that was really smart. Adam, you should know better and try and unite people rather than divide them. Once you challenge someone in a martial way, even symbolically, you invite a response - that's just human nature. And I think it's foolish to think that you issue a challenge and you don't get a response. These things become a herd, a pack. They saw a man who was vulnerable and they piled on. It kept growing. We went over to WA, and the Western Australian crowd can be loud at the best of times, but they were next-level. Every time I got the ball, they booed. Every time I kicked a goal, they booed. Booing is the voice of people who are normally powerless. It's their contribution to the debate. That's their voice. It's not nice, but... that's humanity. Sometimes it isn't nice. He, in the minds of some, had committed the great sin - the black man who complains. Suddenly he wasn't just Adam Goodes the footballer, he was Adam Goodes the angry Aborigine. People don't like the angry Aborigine. It cuts deep here. It's something that reminds us of a history that we'd really rather leave in the past. It was terrible to see. Your natural reaction is to protect your player, and I couldn't protect him. My teammates are feeling this as well. They just don't know what the hell is going on. They just want to be able to do something. Lewis Jetta just threads the needle. Hang on, it's the spear. There's a fair bit of anger in that. He's sending a message to the crowd. And the booing has intensified. Football for me was a place where I got accepted for just being good at football. Didn't matter the colour of my skin, didn't matter where I came from. This safe place that helped me break down barriers actually became the place that I hated to walk out onto. Watching that game in Perth, my son said, "Dad, why are they booing Uncle?" And I was sort of, like, "Oh, hang on, I don't..." I had no words for my seven-year-old to say... .."Mate, they're booing him because he's black." I came out and told people that this has racial undertones and I'd like it to stop, and it didn't stop. Adam said, "This is racist. This is unacceptable." I think from that point forward, anyone that continued to boo was racist. The subject of whether booing at sporting events is racist has dominated conversations around the country. This debate is raging now on social media about, is it racially motivated? And I don't think it IS racially motivated. Being told that if you boo, you're racist - that is so simplistic and moronic. Playing with racial division like that is... is dangerous and stupid. What right have you got to say that the people who boo are racists? They might boo because they don't like who's playing, whether it be Goodes, me, him - they just like to boo. I've booed Adam Goodes, and the reason is I'm a diehard Richmond supporter. He stages for free kicks. I boo him. There's nothing wrong with that. It's got nothing to do with his race. It's got nothing to do with me being a racist. I'm a football fan. Maybe Adam Goodes should have a look within at some of the actions he has done that has incited this type of reaction. He's obviously brought it upon himself, or else the crowd wouldn't be reacting the way they are. Adam Goodes was a symbol we could really unite around before this, but when people see a man richer than they are, more successful than they are acting like he's the victim of a race war that they can't even see, suddenly his symbolism is tarnished. People are not booing you because you're an Aboriginal. They're booing you 'cause you're acting like a jerk. What would they know? What would they know... what would they bloody know what it's like to be a blackfella? From the day you're born, from the day you go to school, from the day you go to work, we're dealing with it every day. People could be saying, "Oh, you're just a big sook." Well, let me put YOU in that situation. Let me question YOU about who you are as a person. Yeah, it's fun and a laugh for you, because you can go there and boo me and feel happy about yourself 'cause you were part of a crowd that did that, but deep down, there's people who are coming to that ground, they're booing me because of my Aboriginality. And you actually... whether you like it or not, you were part of that. It's not Adam Goodes's responsibility to fix this matter up. I find that extraordinary - that the person who feels that he's been racially vilified has been asked to do something to stop it. Regardless of what the motive is: This is a dangerous time for Australia, and if we don't deal with this matter, I'm afraid how Aboriginal people will react to this. We've got to look ourselves in the mirror here, guys. We've got to face our demons as Australians. We are racist. It was not appropriate. It was not respectful. It did not show the best of us. It was ignorant. And often, someone has to break for that to cease. Unfortunately. I was done. I called up John Longmire and I just broke down. "I'm not coming in today. I can't do it." He was emotional. He was clearly drained. I was feeling pretty helpless at the time. I tried my best to look through his eyes and I tried to think that way, but the reality is I'd have no idea what it's like to walk in Adam's shoes, or any Indigenous person's shoes. He made a comment in regards to how if he couldn't be strong, his concern was that other people might not be as strong as what they should be. That really highlighted the stress and the weight that he was carrying. In the eyes of my son, Adam Goodes was Superman, and what he endured was he just got showered with kryptonite. And when you can bring down Aboriginal children's Superman, what does that say for anyone who wants to put their hand up and call racism out? I just was sitting there thinking, "I don't want to be here." He came home and he told me he was leaving that night. I was heartbroken. I was just so worried for him. Trying to ring and it was going to voicemail. And he eventually picked the phone up. I said, "Mate, I'm coming. Where are you going?" He said, "Mate, I'm not telling you, 'cause you'd come." And I'm like, "Yep, course I'm bloody coming!" He goes, "No, mate, I need to do this by myself "and I... I just... I need to get away." "I need to get my feet in the dirt." Home matters. It's a place to go to heal. It's a place to go where you'll be loved. It's a place to go for us where... ..the spirits of our ancestors... ..can hold us tight. When you're in a dark place, it's like you've completely forgotten everything anybody ever said to you that was good. All that you think of are all the bad things that have ever happened to you. All you think about is all the bad things people have said to you. And it's on a stereo playing at the loudest possible decibels in your head, echoing in your mind, "You're worth nothing. "They don't even care about you. "Go away." To stand on a land and say, "2,000 generations of my family are from here. "I'm born out of this place," that feeling is not something you can feel anywhere else. For Adam to go back was the Aboriginal part of him talking. I knew what I was going through. I knew I was in a dark place, and I knew I needed to get myself out of it, but it was incredibly hard to do. So, this is where it all began, I suppose. And all of our mob lived up and down this river, eh? There used to be camps all the way along and all the way back down that way. I'd been overseas for a long time. I'd reported the darkest corners of our world. Now, when you walk through... ..the blood of a terrorist bombing that is so thick on the ground that when you go back to sleep at night, you can taste it in the back of your throat, when you've seen mothers digging out bits of burning flesh from pockmarked holes in the wall to put it into a bag because that's all they've got left to bury of their children, when you've seen what we can do to each other and tear each other apart, often in the name of history and identity, to come back to Australia, for me, and to hear people booing Adam Goodes, what I heard... ..was the echo of our history. All of that pain, all of the children taken, my father beaten by police, moving from town to town, living on the margins, living in poverty - all of it. And in this country - one of the richest, most tolerant, we are told, peaceful countries, the envy of the world - to see it in this country... ..I couldn't believe it. For days, I didn't know where to put those feelings. I didn't know what to say, what to do. And it was really disturbing me. I was really down. What you need to do is now reconnect to country. Yep. And the best way to do that is your feet in the soil. And then my wife said to me one day, "You know, you should write something." So the spirit of the land will now travel through you, Adam. Could lay here all day. And I'd been out for a walk with my dog and I came back and I just sat down at the computer, and in about an hour, it was done. The first thought was the thought I put on the page. I can't speak for what lay in the hearts of the people who booed Adam Goodes, but I can tell you what we heard when we heard those boos. We heard a sound that was very familiar to us. We heard a howl. We heard a howl of humiliation that echoes across two centuries of dispossession, injustice, suffering and survival. We heard the howl of the Australian dream, and it said to us again, "You're not welcome." But it wasn't... contrived. It was honest. 'The Australian dream'. We sing of it and we recite it in verse. "Australians all, let us rejoice, "For we are young and free." My people die young in this country. We die 10 years younger than average Australians. And we are far from free. It's like there's nothing else that matters - in the world, eh? - Yeah. Oh, we love this country so much. We can do things like this, you know? Sit round. Mmm. Learn from each other. The Australian dream is rooted in racism. It is there at the birth of the nation. It is there in 'terra nullius' - an empty land, a land for the taking. 60,000 years of occupation. A people who made the first seafaring journey in the history of mankind. A people of music and art and dance and politics - none of it mattered, because our rights were extinguished because we were not here according to British law. We are part of this land, you know? We come from the land, we go back to the land. In 1963, when I was born, I was counted among the flora and fauna, not among the citizens of this country. Our people, they worked on oral history. - Mmm. - It was passed down, see? Yeah, we didn't write it down. Yeah. Didn't write it, yeah. Yeah. You will hear people say, "But YOU'VE done well." Yes, I have. I've done well because of who has come before me. My father, who lost the tips of three fingers working in sawmills to put food on our table because he was denied an education. My grandfather on my mother's side, who married a white woman who reached out to Australia, lived on the fringes of town until the police came, put a gun to his head, bulldozed his tin humpy and ran over the graves of the three children he buried there! I have succeeded in spite of the Australian dream, not because of it, and I have succeeded because of those people. I've lived in the worst places in the world, and Australia is not one of them. So it's even more important that we don't allow this business to go unsettled - that we give courage and voice to those people who do want to stand up. Every time we are lured into the light, we are mugged by the darkness of this country's history. It matters to me that my children can grow up feeling that this is their place - that they don't have to live with the legacy of trauma. That they don't have to carry the weight of history. That they can live in this remarkable country, with everything this country has to offer. And one day I want to stand here and be able to say as proudly and sing as loudly as anyone else in this room, "Australians ALL, let us rejoice." Thank you. The response that I got was overwhelming. Other Aboriginal people were saying, "That's what WE felt like. You've said how we feel." But the response from non-Indigenous Australians was extraordinary too. Because even at the height of that booing, they didn't boo for the majority of Australians. People were silent, people should have stood up and they didn't, but they found their voice, and they did come out in support of Adam. And it turned. It turned. People stood up. Footballers stood up. Politicians stood up. People in the street stood up. From suburban football grounds to the SCG, there's been an overwhelming show of support for Adam Goodes today. Right across the country, footballers took to the field in honour of one of the game's icons. Thousands of fans have flocked to the stadium with their homemade banners and signs. I was overwhelmed. Up in the Northern Territory, the little kids at the Garma Festival had '37' painted on their backs. He didn't play for the Swans, but his presence was felt as football supporters called for an end to discrimination. The game that he missed had a moment for him where everyone stood up and... ..sent him their good thoughts. It's a standing ovation here at the SCG, and, Adam Goodes, if you're watching, this is for you. Everybody wants you back to football, everybody wishes you the best. I must say, everybody, have a look at this. Play continues, but there is bigger things on people's minds than football this week, and right now, they're showing exactly that. What we saw ultimately was the true measure of who we are. It wasn't the booing, it was the people who stood up to the booing. It can never be too late. It can never be too late for that. Our history is a history of violence and racism, and it's a history of people overcoming that, people reaching across that divide. Jetta. Will this one bring the house down? From outside 50... And there's the celebration. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. I stand with Adam. We stand with Adam. We proudly stand with Adam. When I heard from him, I was so relieved. He sounded good. He sounded... like himself a bit more. Back from his self-imposed exile, Adam Goodes was getting nothing but crowd love today... ..confirming he'd be playing this Saturday against Geelong. He wants to concentrate on the last five games leading into the finals campaign, adding simply that after that, he'll see what happens. Getting away from everything really did empower me to have the strength to come back for those last couple of games, but... I knew it was gonna be over. I just didn't need to subject myself to this arena where it gave people an opportunity to show their racist attitude towards me. I didn't want to give people that platform anymore. I've never been one for the fairytale ending and the perfect send-off. While the retiring Rhyce Shaw was chaired off, the typically understated Goodes told teammates behind closed doors. My ending is my ending. I chose to end it the way that I wanted to. He made the decision to say, "Nuh. Don't need this anymore." But, jeez, it would have been nice to watch him for a couple more years. Mostly the body stops players. The heart and the mind is willing but the body says no. And when you're in Adam's circumstance... ..I reckon... his heart was broken. It's gone from a kid who loved his football, who was obsessed with his footy and was bloody good at it, to now, "Oh, I don't even need to watch a game anymore." I don't blame him. Not at all. I don't know how long it will take for him to be in a position where he feels he can, or he should, or he needs to. He might never feel that way. It's terrible. It's a blight on all of us. From the convicts to the waves of migrants fleeing Europe after World War II, to people who've come in boats looking for a new beginning, that's what the Australian dream offers, in a sense - a refuge from history. But the Australian dream fails to deal with the history of THIS country, and it's that tension that I think sits at the heart of the idea of Australia. So the Australian dream is something that people reach for, and many people attain it, but there's an emptiness at the heart of it, because it hasn't resolved the questions of its own history. We should be learning and teaching this in schools. Because regardless of whether you're ashamed of the history, proud of the history, that IS your history. That is your history. You have to put yourself in someone else's shoes, learn what they've been through, learn what they're going through. Then you have a common understanding around what their views are. In Australia today, one group of people, a people linked directly to that history of suffering and injustice, are still suffering today. And we still haven't found a way to deal with that. While ever we think about this as, "They're INDIGENOUS communities. "They're INDIGENOUS people," it's like it's something that's removed from us. If it was 10 times more likely for kids under the age of 15 to commit suicide in an Australian town, we'd fix it. If there was no running water, if there was no electricity, we'd fix it. But what's been remarkable out of this story is that a new space has opened up. I can feel it. I hear it everywhere. That space that is beyond certainty. The ambiguity that we all feel making our way in the world. We are not just one thing. There are layers to who we are. The space that's opened up now is allowing us to express that - to loosen the chains of that history and to find something bigger about what it is to belong in this country. There's a space to find each other. And Adam helped create that space. You want us to grow thicker skin? Our skin doesn't get any thicker than what it is. You want us to harden up? Well, how about you come on a journey with us and help us? We don't want any handouts anymore. We want a hand UP. Let's give each other a hand up, help educate each other, create better opportunities for all of us. We've got enough wealth in this country to spread it around. We shouldn't have the disadvantage that we have in this country the way we do. I do believe this is a good country predominantly. We've got cracks, but let's not let the cracks get any bigger. And let's hope that at the end, Adam has the position he deserves to have. Not just in sport, but at the heart of the country. He's an Australian of the Year. And I think he can be even more than that. It's the sad thing, isn't it, that people have to suffer for us to get better? I know that will never leave him, but my hope for him is that he can keep his eyes on what he's achieved and that he can show others that there's a path from the worst of Australia to the best of Australia.
