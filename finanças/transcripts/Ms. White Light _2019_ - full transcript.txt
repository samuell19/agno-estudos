(DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PIG SNORTS) (HEART MACHINE BEEPS) (ELLEN CRIES) I'm not like the rest of you. I never made any plans about what I'd do when I grew up. I never thought of being married as you all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth trotting about at home. No use anywhere, but there. I never wanted to go away. The hard part now the hard part now is leaving you all. I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, but it seems, it seems. Goodbye Pearl. - DNR. - Excuse me? She's DNR just in case you didn't... (HEART MACHINE BEEPS IN FLAT LINE) I'll get the doctor. (ELLEN CRIES) And she's not an organ donor, so you know, no rush. (ELLEN CRIES) Thank you so much for everything. I'm so sorry for your loss. Bless you, Mrs. Cordova, what you've done for us, it truly is a miracle. We should all take comfort in knowing that our suffering is over and we, she can finally... - Mrs. Cordova. - Finally be at peace. It's okay if you need to cry too. I know this is your job but you don't have - to be brave for us. - You were Mama's angel, - Mrs. Cordova. - Okay. Did we, oh crud. Is this, is there... Can we stop this, can this stop happening? - An angel among us. - If you could just, if this could just stop happening. - Mrs. Cordova. - You're an angel. Could just, can you... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your loss. What the hell is this? Hold at night, we should, no, oh god never gives you more than you can handle. So, yeah. I think you should go now. What is wrong with her? What's wrong with me? (CHUCKLES) You hired a complete stranger to help your mother die because none of you, her loved ones understood her well enough to provide a sense of peace or dignity, the bare minimum to get her to finally let go. Pearl found you condescending. And you only called her when she sent you birthday checks and you, her only child, you disappointed her Ellen, just like in general. She always related to Beth. I think there was a lot more Joe in her than she realized. You probably didn't know that was her favorite book, did you? I knew her for three days, you had your whole life. You blew it. Get out! I know the timing isn't ideal, but I just wanted to let you know that we're offering a cash bonus as part of our referral program. So if you happen...

I'm not religious. The article doesn't say you have to be religious, it's just pointing out the best places to meet nice single men. I don't have a dog. I know Lex, I know. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) We need a secretary. What? As the CEO it's not professional for me to answer the phone here and you, you know. Would fuck it up. You don't have a unique skill set, no shame in that, but the desk doesn't make any sense without a secretary. Maybe we should get rid of the desk. Think bigger, Lex. We can't afford a secretary. Whose fault is that? I told them about the referrals. I know, I'm sorry that wasn't fair. I'm sure it'll ring soon. I just think it'd be nice you know, the smell of fresh coffee, when we arrive. Comforting, feminine voice greeting potential clients over the phone, the sound of a typewriter clicking away... - They're not all women. - What? Secretaries. Of course, I know that I shouldn't have, it was just in my head, I was picturing, but you're right. In fact, a nice, well put together man might be good too, for you and us, the business. And they're obsolete. Men, or secretaries? Typewriters. You couldn't have studied the note cards a bit more before going in there. I had them memorized Dad, I really did. - I know. - I can't just, you have no idea how much it takes out of me to just make the kind of connection required... I know, Lex, I know. I bet if we talked to someone at the university, we could probably get an intern so we don't have to pay, but a real up and comer, you know, to bring a little sunshine into this place. What's wrong with this place? Nothing per se, you don't want a better life? What? I just think it might be nice if we did better. We do fine. Yeah but better would be better. Someday, you're gonna wanna settle down and you should be set up to... Dad. You deserve to be happy. - We should get a website. - Why? To help solidify our brand. We don't have a brand. Not yet, but with a website. Dad. You couldn't just be nice. Look, I get it, the note cards are there just as a guide and it's not easy what you do, I know that, you know, I know that, but couldn't you just decide to be nice to these people. It's not that simple. No, it is, it is, that's really all it would take. It's just, you just, you know, you do your thing and just shake a few hands, maybe a hug, then leave. They don't need a goddamn Knute Rockne. - Who? - Knute Rockne. Knute Rockne, come on. The client gets it all. - Lex. - You know that. - I just think that if... - Fuck them, fuck the rest of them, I'm not there for them. I can't give what I, it takes everything, I can't just do that and then have some polite chatter and just... If you're not happy doing this, I didn't say that. there are easier ways - to make a living. - Dad, it's not like it's a choice. Sorry. You have a real gift, you know that, right? I think they'd prefer the term administrative assistant now. - Who? - Secretaries. I still think we can make that typewriter thing work. I can't thank you enough for Mrs. Cordova. I can't thank you enough, insert client's name here for letting me be apart of Nora's life. - The Shaw's. - What? Darren and Kelly Shaw, those are her parents, you gotta I can't thank you enough Mrs. Cordova. I can't thank you enough, Darren and Kelly for letting me be a part of Nora's life, It's such a profoundly difficult moment. God bless you, Mrs. Cordova. - Oh come on. - Lex. God bless you. Mrs. Cordova. - God is dead. - Lex. (LAUGHS) - Lex. - Sorry. God is dead Darren and Kelly. Forget it. You're not going to take this seriously. Come on Dad, she's a kid, She's 17 that's all she gets 'cause what some freakish blood condition? I'll deal with her parents okay? You just, you do your thing. One day, you'll be doing this for me you know? Oh Jesus Christ, Dad. No, no, no, listen, I can't, it would break my heart to know I left you here in this world alone, without the ability to take care of yourself. That's all. God closes a door, he opens a window. I nailed that shit! (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KNOCKS ON DOOR) A little more ice, I'm good. I'm not a nurse. Doctors can't get ice? I'm not a doctor either. - Then who are you? - I'm... Nevermind. - My name is... - What is this? - Can I answer? - What? - You can't... - Forget it. - See... - Just go. - Can I just... - I'm not doing this. - Doing what? - This, leave! You're dying. You're going to do that alone. And while intellectually it might be easy to rationalize, it must be pretty difficult trying to find comfort in the fact that right now, just this particular moment, it's just your turn. - I'm Lex, by the way. - What the hell? Why are you here? This is what I do. - You creep out dying girls? - Are you creeped out? I'm not not creeped out. What are you like a therapist or something? Independent contractor so to speak. - Doing what? - This. What is this? I meet with people right before they die. - Why? - Peace of mind, spirit, brief moment of existential comfort, it's what it says on our business cards. People call it all sorts of stuff though. Some people think it's religious, magical and other worldly channeling. I don't know this thing I do. - Sounds like bullshit. - It's not. So what you just stand there until whatever's supposed to happen, actually happens? Pretty much, yeah. - What if you run out of time? - Never had that problem. Not yet. - You into swords? - Aspiring Samurai. Should have been my destiny not some random ass blood thing that doesn't even have a foundation or a Wikipedia page dedicated to it. Bushido. Man, it could have been legendary. Bushido? Yeah you know, like the way of the warrior, the code. Righteousness, courage, benevolence, respect, sincerity, honor, self-control, loyalty. It's beautiful. You talk a lot. Well, you know 780 on the English portion of my SAT and I can't take that with me so. - What'd they try? - To save me? Antibiotics, more antibiotics, transfusions. I'm on some experimental drug thing right now, but I could totally taste the placebo sugar. I'm pretty sure you can't actually taste the sugar in it. - I was being hyperbolic. - Oh. What's the goal here again? Peace. Oh okay and you've really never failed at it? No. So I'd like be forever burned in your memory as the one that got away? There's still time. You sure about that? (NORA GASPS) Honestly, I could have died in that moment. It's okay if you need to cry, I understand no judgment. - You smiled. - No I didn't. You did when you were talking about being burned in my memory forever. So what, is that like a crime? No, it's a tell. A tell, what does that even mean? You're afraid they'll forget you. - Who? - I don't know, parents. Oh please, they are self obsessed dicks. This whole thing is so they can get closure. I couldn't care less how they remember me. - Siblings? - Only child. Friends, boyfriend, - aunts and uncles... - Is this the magic part, please tell me, this is where the magic actually happens. - I don't get it. - So I win? No, you die, still alone, still terrified in your inability to let me help you with that, does it make it any less tragic. I'm not afraid, okay, I'm pissed. - 'Cause you got a shit deal? - We all get a shit deal. It's the timing I have a problem with it. I mean, come on, I'll live on in the hearts of friends and family yay, but this was my shot and I wasted it. Fine, so what would you have done differently? You mean other than become a master of all major sword and hand to hand combat? Time travel to feudal Japan and really fuck some shit up? Yeah. I don't know, I don't know, that's the thing, I don't have an unfulfilled dream to lament. I didn't have the time, okay, I didn't have the time. No I did, I just wasted it. (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC) Well, if it makes you feel any better, most people say the same thing. Why would that make me feel any better? Yeah, oh man I don't know. Okay, look you're such a dick. - I'm sorry. - You get paid for this? Yeah. But you smiled. You smiled so I win. It's a nervous laughter. This is nervous laughter 'cause I feel bad for you. ANNOUNCER: A millionaire's million, now this show is just two weeks away. Will one of these players make it to the leaderboard tonight? We should be on Twitter. What a terrible idea. And Instagram. Why? Technology Lex, you gotta adapt. What's Periscope? We got one client under the age of 50 and now you think we should just... The world keeps spinning whether we choose to acknowledge it or not. But still, most of the people dying are old. Mostly, sure. What are you saying? You offer a niche product, Lex, there's an unexplored market out there. I see no reason why we should ignore the possibilities. Watching 17-year-olds die is depressing, that's one reason. Well, technically didn't stick around until... And then she went into a coma. My job was done from there. Her parents seemed grateful for your work. Maybe if her parents had been better parents, they wouldn't have needed me in the first place. Yeah, maybe we aren't quite ready for social media. ANNOUNCER: 25 for the fifth contestant, that's $3,000 Brenda. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Valerie Monroe age 61, stage four, pancreatic cancer, no siblings, no children and no spouse. - Who hired us? - She did. I think she has you now, right? And on the more positive note, no family around really lowers the chances of you getting punched. Do I even need these then? Lowers, not removes. I'm going to pull back my energy now. (CHUCKLES) All right, thank you Tim. And thank your dear father too, may he rest in peace. Okay, love and blessings. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Can I help you with something? What? You're kind of staring? No I'm not. Please forgive my daughter, she's, we're in the middle of prepping for a very important client, so, you know, she's normally not this rude. Isn't that right, Lex? Her name's Lex short for Alexis. - You were talking. - What? You were talking, I didn't... Lex. - I'm Gary, by the way. - Spencer. Oh, that's a sturdy name for a sturdy fella. Don't you think honey? Spencer, is that a family name or... You two don't look like lawyers. GARY: I'm sorry? You said you had a client here, I just assumed that in this context that makes you lawyers. Actually we're small business owners, thriving business owners. I'm the CEO and Lex is, well she's, I guess you can call her the talent. I mean seriously she's got a real... Cordova and Cordova Mortality Solutions. Incorporated, well, technically we're an LLC, but we thought the I-N-C had a better ring to it. Why don't we look like lawyers? SPENCER: What? You said we don't look like lawyers. Oh, your clothes have a slept in quality and you have mustard right there on your shirt. No offense. - None taken. - Some taken. I took some. So Spencer, is it? What do you do if you don't mind me asking? Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I'm much more interested in what it is that you do. I mean Mortality Solutions, that sounds fascinating. We really don't have time. Well, it's sort of a complicated... Do you plan funerals? Oh no, it's more along the lines... It's really hard to prep with all the talking. Sort of it's hard to, while there's a large philosophical component to it, there's also a, you're much better at describing it. I'm working. We're working so. A brief moment of existential comfort. You're going to have to explain that. It's pretty self explanatory. Come on Lex. Come on Lex. Yeah Lex, come on. We do what they can't. - They? - Family members, friends, self-proclaimed loved ones. People that have failed someone in their life to such a profound extent that they have to outsource that person's last and greatest existential dilemma to a stranger with mustard on her shirt. And they're not slept in, I'm really bad with an iron. It's true. I tried to teach her the proper technique. I even offered to do it for her but... You're still staring. You're still talking. This is a conversation, I didn't even want to be a part of it. At my pecs. I like an athletic cut, so you know it happens, CrossFit? Well, I always say if you've got it, you might as well flaunt... - Oh my god, it's time. - Yeah I guess you're, remember cards are there as a guide, not a crutch. She's a good kid. What is it you say you did again? - (PHONE VIBRATES) - I didn't. Hey. Yes I do. (DRAMATIC PERCUSSION MUSIC) Valerie. Valerie. (VALERIE COUGHS) The Pulled Pork Experience, that's thier name I know because their theremin player is my drug dealer and I feel like I should be supportive of their art. I don't normally have a lot of patience for white guys with dreadlocks, not entirely pro-drum circle either, but they really believe it when they play. It matters so much to them, it's kinda beautiful. But they're fucking terrible though, aren't they? (LAUGHS) - Drug dealer? - Yeah. This stuff can get a bit predictable. I like to supplement from time to time. Mostly edibles, nothing too crazy. Hey you want some? I'm Alexis Cordova. You can call me Lex. You hired me. So, that's a hard pass on the weed. Got it. - Valerie. - Which one are you? - I'm sorry? - Please, please tell me you don't have cards or crystals? - Valerie. - No, nope, call me Val. - Val. - Let's try just V. Nope, Valerie, Val, that's the familiarity sweet spot. You've been having a lot of visitors? What's a normal head count for deathbed visitations just as a point of reference? I was actually just referring to the eternal peace field specifically. You've been having a lot of visitors? Sort of a new hobby of mine. It'd be so much cheaper for me to just find God though, right? Wow, you just seem so much lighter than I expected. That would be the I'm dying of cancer diet. Oh, I was referring to your mood. Well, I could try moping if that would make you feel more... Well it's just no children, no spouse, no siblings, parents deceased. So moping it is. This isn't easy and sure as hell is a normal, which is weird because it happens to all of us. If you're worried about death and you're afraid to let go, I'd first asked myself this what kept me up at night before I got sick? Fear of death at it's core. So it was just fear of something else. What are you afraid of Valerie? - Val. - What? I thought we agreed to call me Val. (CHUCKLES) Why'd you hire me, Val? You're not a Scientologist are you? Excuse me? Because you have like this weird vibe about you and your clothes like a sloppy Scientologist. Are Scientologists even allowed to be sloppy? Oh I see what you're doing. And you don't strike me as the horoscope. I bet I don't because I'm not. You know voodoo, magic numbers type. - I don't see a Ouija board. - Didn't bring one. I don't see any weird candles, I'm still trying to figure out what you are. Oh but you, you hired me. Oh honey, I hire just about everybody in this time zone, even tangentially connected with the business of dying. Apparently death is thriving these days. Oh, okay, so this is a joke to you. What's the alternative? (SPENCER KNOCKS) Oh knock, knock. - Hey. - Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, am I early? I'm sure you know the answer to that already. Psychic humor, isn't Val the best? - You don't have to go. - Yes, I do. This isn't a joke. Take care. Oh, there is a lot of energy in this room today my dear. I hope you're ready for a killer reading. Didn't we agree on a no pun rule last time? - Yes we did. - You forgot? Yep, was she doing your horoscope? What are you, you're cancer. - No, I have cancer. - Oh, that's right. Ba-dum-bump, I know you're here all week. (LAUGHS) I'm just saying it's a thing that people do, most people on a regular basis. - Not me. - That's clear, but Mrs. Monroe is willing to pay for you to come back and she seemed, you know, fun, when I talked to her on the phone, did I mention she's willing to pay. I can't help her. She would suggest otherwise. She doesn't need what I offer. She just, I don't know what she's doing, but I'm not gonna be a part of her parade of death buddies. Death buddies? Apparently she's bringing in people that just, anybody who claims to know anything about this particular field. - Can you blame her? - What? She's dying, Lex? She's not scared. Is that a bad thing? Yeah because I help people who are dying, that's what I do. - Then fake it. - Fake. - Yeah. - Fake it. You go back, you say something, she's happy. We get paid, it's a win, win. There's an integrity to what I do. And it requires complete and total trust... Oh for god's sake Lex, just be normal. - What? - Be normal. Do normal things, live a normal life. If someone wants to pay for your services, you do the best you can. And sometimes yes, you have to show up and do the things you don't wanna do. That's why it's called work. It's how everyone else operates. Why would I want to be like everyone else? Because it has to be better than this. (RADIO MUSIC) Dad. Are you seeing this too? We should call the police. Am I dead, did have a stroke in the parking lot? Yeah, I want to report a break in. Don't touch anything. They're gonna wanna get prints. Yeah, no, technically they didn't take anything, nothing's damaged. Hazelnut, let this be my final memory. I'm ready now. I don't know. They fucking tidied everything up like aggressively. Hello? You guys should consider investing in a watering can. It's really hard to fit this thing under the sink. Are you some sort of angel or something? Oh my God, you're a zombie. - I'm Nora. - Gary, wonderful to meet you. Nora Shaw, the coma girl. The coma, oh. Oh, you look great. Well, you know, not dying has really done wonders for my complexion. - What the hell? - Lex. No, it's fair. Turns out that last round of experimental drugs, not so sweet after all. You can't just break into a place of business. I wasn't planning on it, I just came by to say, thank you, but when I looked in the window, I assumed that the place had been robbed or something, you know, maybe even a violent kidnapping of sorts. Thank me for what? Well, I'm not dead, so that's sort of something. I had nothing to do with that. I'm not saying that you're a miracle worker, but something happened that night. Something more than just medicine or whatever. You saved my life. LEX: No I didn't. Well, you might have and that's good enough for me. - What do you want? - I owe you. You've done more than enough. I mean, bagels, wonderful touch. Yeah, okay, so we're even, you can go. You saved my life, now I have to save yours. It's basic Samurai code. - That's stupid. - You're stupid. I'm not dying. Technically, we're all dying every day, just a long slow march towards the inevitable and eternal darkness. I'm assuming you want the Asiago? - How can I help? - You can't. We're fine, really and thanks for everything. (NORA SHUTS DOOR) (NORA OPENS DOOR) No, Bushido, leaving, isn't an option. What the fuck? Righteousness. I'm definitely right about this. Courage. Only a coward would abandon you in your time of need. - My time of need. - Benevolence. You're welcome. Respect. Are you enjoying your bagel, Mr. Cordova? I am, thank you. Sincerity, I owe you my life Lex. - No you don't. - Honor. I won't rest until I save your life too. Self control. I'll refrain from using my deadly martial arts slash sword skills on you whenever you're being an asshole, which from what I can tell is quite often. - I like her. - And loyalty. I promise to never abandon you unless the time comes when you no longer need me. Holy shit, that's right now, Sometimes people need to do something for somebody else in order to deal with their own shit, okay. - So? - So what? - How do we fix you? - I'm not broken. (CHUCKLES) You do have a few issues. I don't have to, are, man you can't be here, we have work to do. - No, we don't. - Dad! You turned down our only current job offer, So unless you want to, you know, reconsider going back to the hospital and working with Mrs. Monroe, we have all the time in the world. Great, where should we start? ♪ Over and over and over I'll say it again ♪ ♪ I'm happy when the sun don't shine over these trees ♪ SPENCER: What are the cards for? They're part of the job The, oh, what is it, the fatality fixes? - Mortality Solution. - Yes, right, I knew it was something catchy. So what's on them? - What? - The cards. That's really none of your business. Okay, now look, I don't care, I was just trying to make conversation. Val doesn't invite too many people back a second time, so I figured it would be good to see where you're coming from. Money's not going to be an issue by the way. What? For Val, I mean, she's got more than enough to go around so there's plenty of room for us to do what we do. I'm a psychic medium in case you were wondering. - I wasn't. - Really? Because I kinda got the sense that you were there - for a second... - I really gotta get back. The cards right, sorry. So what's your angle? My what? I mean, how do you build trust? Is it a cold read, is it a hot read, is that what the cards are for? I mean, like they, it's like Val's background information - and then... - It's real. - What? - What I do. - What do you mean? - Like real. - As opposed to... - A lie, a scam, total bullshit. Wow. I wasn't, I didn't, whatever, I gotta get back to this. - The anger. - What? So present in your being. - What are you? - And it's deep, buried, entrenched in every cell. You're not angry at someone, it's much deeper than that. What is it, the universe, God, most profound concepts that you can conjure up in your head. You've got enough anger inside of you to destroy it. - Oh fuck me. - But it doesn't complete you. And you know that. Still there's that part of you that you can feel, but it's empty, it's questions without answers. I think seems fair. You know when it's not. But you are not alone, Lex, you're not alone. Now tell me that shit isn't real. Oh my god, you're messed up. I know, I was just proving a point. You have problems. Well, you're good, you're well adjusted. Hey, you know, you shouldn't be so sensitive. It just kinda fucks with your aura. - Raise. - I really don't have time- - This is interesting 'cause Doug's been betting hard since the very beginning. So I don't see how the turn or the river could have possibly helped you so I know, you're bluffing and Grogan's been suspiciously quiet through the entire hand. So that makes me think he's blocked the set, which leads me to Terry. I haven't been able to get a read on you all day. He thinks we're playing go fish. Okay, forget it. Okay, we'll take this up tomorrow, boys. Same time, same place. I know where you work, go settle up with my goons on the way out. - What? - This isn't a game. It literally is, was until you pissed all over it. - What do you want? - I want pizza. - Then order one. - I'm not hungry. Then why do you want a pizza? I want you to order it so that if I'm not up for it, it can be yours and then I don't have to be all depressed about a missed opportunity. Okay, well guess what, I'm not here to order you food. The Wiccan priestess was much more amenable than you. Oh really, I'll go get her. I want to want pizza. I haven't been hungry for months. Even when I get high, it's like, oh that hospital jello looks kind of, no I'm nauseous. I wanna want things still, I miss that. What do you want from me? I want you to stay for the remaining eight minutes of the session that I'm paying you for. - Why? - Why not? Isn't the customer always right? I'm not an Applebee's I do one thing, that's it, and you don't need it. - And what is that? - I remove fear. You're not afraid, Valerie, you're just lonely. So save me from that. It seems like a pretty valid service to me. Yeah, the one thing you can get from pretty much any hospice nurse. There is something about the, "We'll just make you comfortable until you fade away," that I don't know, it's not for me. Well, I guess that's why you have your psychic friend just waiting in the wings, either way, I am done. - What about you? - What about me? You know, so much about fear, what are you afraid of? This isn't about me. When you're on your death bed and you have to call someone like yourself to, I don't know, exercise your demons, what's the thing you'll be worried about? What are we doing here? We're talking like people. Get a chance to do that much? Yeah part of my job is building trust with my clients, so we talk and share or whatever, so yeah. - What about everyone else? - Who? People who aren't about to die? Do you talk and share and whatever with them? - Why does it matter? - Why doesn't it? - Do you have anyone? - For what? To talk to. You want to help finish the job you wanna help me let go. You want to build that trust. Well my trust comes at a premium, Lex. Come sit down, come on. - My dad. - What? I have my dad, we talk all the time. Well, parents don't count. I didn't say parents. Just your dad. Well, he's either way, you know, genetically disposed to give a shit about you, which is great that he cares, but it doesn't count till you get out there and earn one. - Earn one? - Yeah, a person. You find someone, no ties, just a person out in the world and you earn their giving a shit about you, love, friendship, something real. Then you got a chance. For what? For what?

Probably gonna have it memorized soon? You actually memorized it. - So? - So it's weird. Well, there's gotta be a clue, a tell. I don't know, everybody's afraid of something. - I hate rats. - Heights. Undercooked meat. - Moist towelettes. - You guys mind? Oh, I almost forgot. You got a message from some guy named Spencer. Thanks for dinner. Spencer, huh? I didn't realize she had friends. - Neither did I. - Interesting. Yes, yes it is. I, we, I gave him an old pizza and we didn't, I didn't, it was his old. - Are you blushing? - You're blushing. Actually she looks kind of pale, you okay? - I'm fine. - You sure? I didn't have a romantic Italian dinner last night but other than that I'm fine. (GARY LAUGHS) The cheese was cold. I didn't take it out of the box for him. Crust was really greasy, it was gross. The pepperoncini was all soggy, I don't like that. And it's not like I even ate it with him. So I don't see what the big deal is. VAL: Clearly, it's not. Okay, let's change the subject. VAL: You brought it up. Okay, well now I'm changing it. - To what? - Well, you. Me. That's why we're here, right? Okay, my urine looks like ice tea. That's not at all... Seriously, that baggy thing, looks like a fresh batch of Lipton. - Thank you for that. - Yeah. I suppose to mean, I'm getting close when it looks like that. I know. Of course you do, you do this all the time, this is my first crack at death. How do you feel about that? Well, you know how, when you first turn 18 and they're telling you you're finally an adult and you still feel like a little kid and then you turn 40 and everybody's telling you you're finally established and maybe you even play the part but deep inside you still feel like a scared 20-year-old. They told me my 50's would bring wisdom. I still can't get past the first page of Ulysses. And I like sharing memes on Facebook. (LAUGHS) (COUGHS) Oh, okay hold on. Just a sec, just a sec. Incoming, there's a little one, hold on, one second, give me a second. Thanks. So when it comes to dying, the most inevitable process we have, I guess I still haven't bought in. I'm not there yet. Seriously, why do you do this? You ever watched someone die? Like really be there till the end. - No. - It's beautiful. I mean, it's weird obviously for the reasons that it would be but facing death like sharing that with someone, no baggage, no bullshit, just perfect human exchange, there's nothing terrifying about it. My mom died fast, it was a car accident when I was a kid. It was a semi truck that just crossed the line for a second, spilled coffee or something. Just completely obliterated the driver's side of the car. My dad was in the passenger seat, I was behind him. Not a scratch on us. She didn't even get a chance to scream. So I wondered if there was that moment, a fraction of a second that the terror really set in for her. Just that knowing that was it. No resolution, no answers, no goodbye. You have that chance to come to terms with whatever it is that you're still lingering to say anything, to ask anything. - Lex. - What a gift, you are so lucky you don't even know it. What are you doing? You got to have that moment, you get to write the end. Just stop. Whatever you're holding on to, whatever you're afraid of let it go on your terms before it's too late. Let go, let go. Let me know if you make it out of that car. Hey, how's, everything okay? Take care of her. Good job, next up from Star city, it's our friend, Betty. How are you Betty? Never underestimate the Salisbury steak? What it lacks in presentation more than makes up for. In meat-like calories. Give it a try at least, I haven't really seen you eat much since you've been here. Still getting my appetite back. Aren't you like missing school or something? Lex. Do your parents even know you're here? I'm on a Samurai honor mission. They respect that unlike some people. A Samurai secretary, what more can you ask for? Samurai administrative assistant. Right, of course, forgive me for not being up to date on. She's 17. I have a timeless warrior soul. It's true. She can't... What, make coffee and answer phones. I strongly disagree. And type almost 50 words per minute, I tested her yesterday. When was the last time you guys dusted? Why? Excess dust is bad for the respiratory system. Why are you still here? Look at us. Look at our lives. That's exactly why I'm still here. Your sadness clearly extends well beyond the walls of your business. Until we figure out how to fix you, you're stuck with me. - No. - Yes. If you don't call her parents, I will. My parents deferred to you when they thought I was dying. You think they're worried, now? I'm a badass with an ancient code. You don't have to worry about me. You on the other hand, well. (PERSISTENT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) Why aren't we answering the door? We don't get many visitors around here. (PERSISTENT KNOCKING) This is ridiculous. - Is Lex here? - Yes she is. Hey, can we talk? - What are you... - It's Val. - What's wrong? - Invite him in Lex. Yeah, Lex, invite him in. - Who are you? - I'm Nora, Lex brought me back from the dead. You must be Spencer. Yeah, can we go someplace and just... Hey Spencer, pardon my daughter's manners. We don't get a lot of drop-ins around here. Would you like to join us for dinner, we're having steak. I'll grab my coat. - You kids have fun. - Okay go. NORA: But not too much fun. I'm just kidding. You guys really like your food compartmentalized. I've had some great meals here. I hear it is one of the better hospital cafeterias in town. It's actually the only one, so. Oh you were making a joke? Yes, I was. This is called banter. Is that why you brought me here to banter? You've gotta be a lot of fun at parties. I don't go to parties. Really, are you too busy dating? - Banter. - Is this a date? (LAUGHS) I'm sorry. What's wrong with Val? You tell me. - You brought me here. - She's different. LEX: What? Whatever it was that you said to her, I don't know, she, I know that she plays things off like it doesn't actually matter, but she, you know, it's different, she's different. And I don't think she's okay. - She's dying. - Yeah. That's not what I mean. I know. She told you what I said. I heard it through the, was it true? - What? - Stuff about your mom? Why would I lie about that? - I don't know. - Would you? Look, there's a lot of gray area doing what it is that we do. We don't do the same thing. Oh, are you sure about that? Yeah, it's real what I do, you... What? Do you honestly think you talk to the dead? That's not what people hire me for. That's literally your job. No my job is to make people feel better about death, like you. Seriously do you have the pallet of a post-apocalyptic cockroach, this is... You are wearing a Henley. So I could do without the judgment. Says the woman who clearly thinks that I'm a fraud. Am I wrong? - It's not appropriate. - Am I wrong? Look, I get letters from people all the time, thanking me for helping them through the loss of a spouse or a parent or a child. So yeah, that is real what I do. But it's bullshit, right? Yeah, everything's bullshit the minute that you pretend that death isn't fucking terrifying. I'm not that bad of a guy Lex. - I didn't say you were. - Yeah but you're thinking it. Why do you care what I think? I don't. (LAUGHS) What? - Oh fuck. - What? Oh you care what I think. No, I don't. - Oh my God. - No, I don't. - Yeah you do. - No, I don't. - Oh man. - What? Nothing, I'm fine, I'm fine. You're, look, you're clearly. why don't you just get over yourself and we can focus on Val. Why does it matter to you so much? - What? - Helping her. - She's a client. - One of how many? - No she's different. - How? All of my other clients, they wanna connect with somebody who has passed. She just wants to connect. She listens, I don't get a whole lot of that. You know, I find people, that's what I do, I don't lose them. I don't know how to do this. - Do what? - Say goodbye. - I've tried everything. - Yeah, so have I. - But I was thinking. - Oh no. - What if we work together? - What? Yeah, - like a team. - Fuck no. I work alone. Yeah and you eat like a child and you dress like your dad. Maybe a little change would be good. - Come on. - No. Come on, hey look, I helped people hang on, you help them let go, between the two of us, we've got pretty much everything covered. - No. - Please. - No. - Come on. No. I'm being like extra charming right now. - No, you're not. - Lex. Nope. I think, that you - and us together... - No, the answer is no. - Please. - No, no. - Please. - No. - Please. - Fuck no, no. I'm not paying double for this. I guess humor really is the last thing to go. It's actually the lungs. (LAUGHS) I would have pegged you for the straight man in is little duet you've thrown together. Oh, Lex is a lot of fun. Especially once you get to know her. Oh, you've come to the right place for fun. Hey, who wants a hit off my morphine? - Valerie. - Val. Val. - I'm not ready. - What? For what you do. I don't want it to end. Who says it has to? My body, the doctors, God apparently. Since, when do you believe in God? I don't, it hasn't stopped him from fucking up my plan? Hey, where's my pizza? - It's on the way. - You're a shitty liar. So who are we gonna bring in today? A long lost uncle, childhood friend. - Your parents. - Again. Hey, what, hey I don't choose who comes through so. Surprise me okay. I'll do my best. Yeah, maybe I should... No say stay, stay. It's okay. I see a girl. She is holding a bouquet of freshly picked flowers in one hand and in the other a pocket watch. - Are you still with me? - Yeah. Oh she's smiling, it's a great smile, beautiful. Like yours. - I wish. - Oh my God, you guys. This girl she's gripping them so tight like it's... - Why? - It's hard to say. You sure you don't know her? You know, I don't have any kids. It doesn't have to be literal. Sometimes it - can be a symbol for... - No kids, imagine that. They all told me, family, friends, random people who thought they knew better. They all said, one day, one day, you'll meet someone, fall in love, start a family. One day I was gonna finally be complete, whole one day. Shit, made it sound like some disease I was going to have to catch in order to be like the rest of them. Fuck that. (SPENCER LAUGHS) They were right about one thing though. I did meet someone, several someones. I was loved, I loved, never made me wanna settle down though. Never made me feel whole, never made me wanna be like them, as they said. The thing is, I always felt whole. I was fine. I just wished I'd figure that out earlier. (CHUCKLES) That girl that's holding the flowers and the pocket watch, that's supposed to be me, right? I only interpret what comes through, so. Yeah, real subtle on the symbolism Mrs. Cleo. Jesus. (LAUGHS) - But I don't get it. - Get what? Is it the morphine, or I'm just, I don't, are you? - What? - You know it ends, right? - It ends. - Lex. Okay if this is how you wanna, I'm glad that you're happy, I'm so glad, but the moment is coming, when it feels like it's slipping away and when there's a panic. - Lex, you don't... - No, this is final. And it's not like, it's not like closure final, okay. You're going to wanna to cling to something and you're not going to be able to because it's coming and it might take hours or seconds but it's not even gonna feel like time passing to you and you don't have to be scared. You don't have to be scared. I can take that away from you but right now I don't, I don't know how to help you. I don't know how to help you. It's okay. (SLOW MUSIC) It's okay, it's okay. I just didn't wanna die alone. (SLOW MUSIC) That woman, probably logged 30 hours in the past month. That's just the billable ones. I mean, sometimes I would pretend like we had an appointment just so I could spend more time with her. All that time, I don't know her real story, just like basic stuff. Probably everything that you have in your files. No old stories, memories, it's just, I don't know. But I feel like I know her, like her and she knows me and it's like, everybody talks about, you know, live in the moment, but most people don't do it and, everything all right? I ate something that was weird but... Shut up. - Regret. - What? Regret, that's it, that's definitely it. Were you here, like 10 seconds ago? I think the regret thing that's how I'm... I can do this, I just need, yeah. See, 'cause I don't think that you get kissed like that very often, I think maybe that's what we should focus on right now. - She needs me. - What? Valerie, she needs me. - Val's fine. - No it's an act. Are you serious? Everyone's afraid of death. Don't do this to yourself. And I know, I know when the time comes, she's going to need someone. Look, this is your shit, it's not hers. Okay, I don't expect you to understand what I do or why people need what I do. Just leave her out of this. I can't when people need me like this, leaving is not an option. She's not your mom, Lex, she, just don't put that on her. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lex, Lex. Hey, can we please talk about this, like people? What the hell! - How was your date? - It wasn't, why are you still here? You've been gone for an awfully long time for it not being a date. - I was with a client. - Sorry, did she... No, not yet. So you're not done with her? No, yes, I don't know. Kind of a tall drink of water, huh? Valerie? No, Spencer, your date. It wasn't a date. You didn't answer my question. Yeah, he's tall, whatever. - Go to bed. - I'm not tired. You were on death's door like less than a month ago, shouldn't you be focusing on getting better? - I'm fine. - Are you? Did you at least get to first base? - Nora? - I'm fine, okay. How many times do I ever tell you that, I'm fine. Till I believe you. Well, I guess I can't fault you for caring. - What? - What? You just did a thing. No I didn't. Yes you did when I said you cared. - You just did it again. - No. You totally just care flinched. All right I'm going to bed. Do they have to be dying? The people you let yourself care about is that like part of the deal for you? It's my job. A job you made up, but nobody else does, a job you never stop doing. You think it's easier that way. What? Losing someone and you know it's part of the deal. I guess I never thought about it like that. How do you think about it? I don't. I can't. Are you really okay? I was supposed to die. We all know that, once we got past all the tragically young shit, it was something that not even the most optimistic doctor or delusional family member could deny. It was my time. You helped me accept that. Right before I went into that coma, I remember feeling somewhat ready, whatever that means. It was like I was outside myself, watching it happen to someone else and suddenly all the sadness and the anger and the fear and the heartache it started to add up to something. It didn't go away but it started to make sense. And it was kind of beautiful. When I woke up, I still felt it. I still do. I figured it'd be a waste to not try and share that - with someone else before... - Before what? Before I remember that the world still sucks. God's dead, I'm an asshole and you're fucking hopeless. Do you have any ice cream? What? I don't know I thought maybe we could stay up all night do each other's nails, talk about your new boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. - Yes he is. You just went on a date with him. He's not. Is that him? About him being your new boyfriend. Shit.

I think maybe you should just do what we hired you to do because the morphine's not enough and the nurse says that he screams at night (SOBS) and I just think that you should be telling him this when they move him in here and not us because we're not dying.
