SINGING This programme contains some strong language. 'I was in Lagos, Nigeria, 'finding out how this dynamic and chaotic city polices itself. 'For several weeks, I'd been living on both sides of the law. 'The area boys - toughs who run the neighbourhood.' I can kill you and eat you. If it gets to that level. 'The glamorous kingpin to whom many of them owe allegiance.' His shoes! A very fashionable person. He does his shopping in Italy. You do the shopping in Italy? Yes. 'I'd also been riding with the paramilitary task force 'created to bring order to the streets with strong-arm tactics that made them equally feared. 'My idea - to experience life at its most lively 'in a city torn between law and disorder.' There's a slightly weird atmosphere. HORNS HONK 'I was on my way to Lagos Island, 'the downtown area and the oldest part of the city. 'A youth leader nicknamed Shevchenko offered to introduce me to a smalltime gang boss, Tawa.' Nice to meet you. I'm Louis. Tawa, what is this place? This place is... UNCLEAR Is this your base? Yes, this is my base. You control the market around here? Yeah. And the bus stop here? Yes. You control it? Yes. 'Tawa claimed legitimacy by being part of a national transportation union.' She's a leader of the union. Branch. You're in charge of a branch? A branch chairman? "Motorcycle operator of NURTW". Yeah. "Motorcycle operator, NURTW". You take money from the motorcycle drivers? Is that what he does? You're a woman and these are strong men? Yeah. Can't they attack you? How do you keep control? Nobody can attack me. Why not? Like god. Because of god? She's a god. Can you fight? I fight. How? Anyhow. Like a man. Like a man? Yeah. Is it true? EVERYONE: Yes! Who's your number two? Your vice? This one vice. You're the vice? Louis. Your name? Xonde. What does this mean? That shows he's a tough guy. What happened? That looks painful. Can you ask him how it happened? That's like a euphemism. Exactly. So he doesn't want to talk about...? 'Tawa took me on a tour of her neighbourhood. 'She told me she collects union dues from commercial vehicles 'and an unofficial tax on local shopkeepers.' If a boy goes to a shop and says, "I've come from Tawa.... Where is her money?" And the man says, "I don't have any money." What would happen... What? If he told me, you understand? I would do it for him. You'd let him off? Uh-huh. "It's OK. I'll come back tomorrow." He would have to pay? Yeah. 'A little later, a fight broke out among Tawa's boys, 'for reasons that weren't immediately apparent.' What's the problem? Let's go. Let's go. What's the problem? It's just the money. The money? Yeah. He wants some money? Yeah. They want money. Do you think she's had enough? Yeah. Exactly. 'It became clear we were no longer welcome. 'There are area boys throughout Lagos. Many are union members. 'It's believed that they use their positions for extortion 'and run their neighbourhoods like personal fiefdoms. 'I was on my way uptown, to an area called Oshodi 'hoping to meet one of the union's top bosses. 'His name was MC. I had an "in" with his trusted aide, Mamoc.' How long have you been working with MC? Less than two years but I've known him for, say, 20 years. 20 years? Yes. You grew up together? Yeah. We grew up together. What is it about the relationship that works? You see... I believe something that... Should I move up? How do you do? I'm fine. Do you know me? No. Louis. Comcoco Zaria. People call me Zaria. Yes. Zaria? Comcoco Zaria. The MC's Vice? Deputy. Yes. Second-in-command. What do you do? We are the National Union. National Union of Road Transport Workers? Yes. What are some of your responsibilities? I don't understand you. What you basically do. When MC's not around, you can always count on him. So whatever he does, in MC's absence, you take it that it's MC that is doing it. Do you understand me? Yes, I do. That's my job. So you have a big team under you? Yes. Many people? You can't count them. I have to pass the MC. Hm. Do you understand me? No. Let me make a comparison of the President and the Vice President. Your President is answerable to everything that happens within his government. But you discover that the Vice-President takes a broader and wider responsibility than the President in terms of mobilisation. The Vice-President does a lot of mobilisation than the President. Am I making any sense? Yes. That is what basically he does. How many boys do you have under you? You can't count them. So you would have hundreds of boys under you? Thousands? Yes. How did you come to be the Vice President? There are a lot of intrigues. It's his loyalty. His unflinching loyalty to MC. Just from loyalty to MC. Yes. Loyalty. It's more like a court of a king, if you know what I mean? Royalty. It's the court of a king? You just hit the nail on the head. VOICES AND MUSIC Where has MC gone? That's him on the high table. On the high table? Yeah. 'The event we'd arrived at was a Muslim celebration. 'It involved MC donating large amounts of money to a local mosque.' SINGING 'I'd hoped it might be a chance to get to know the man himself, 'but he had other duties to attend to. 'My interview would have to wait. 'A few days later, hoping to understand more about the finances of his operation, 'I arranged a tour of MC's territory.' There's a toll that you pay. Who does? There's a toll that you pay. The traders? Yes. Who do they pay the toll to? Of course, to MC. All these traders? Yes. And the buses, too? Everybody. Which ones? Do you know him? I know him. Shall we say a quick hello? Hello. Hello. How you doing? How's business? All right, thank you. How much? From each...? The bikes are like taxis? They're like taxis. Is that right? Yes. And you take the fee here? They take the fee here. Some goes to MC? You know, MC... He's in charge of collecting? He's in charge. The National Union of Road Transport Workers. Yes. Thank you. It's good for one day? Yeah. For one. At the end of the day, the guys will take their money to MC? Yes. Or once a week? It's a weekly thing. What are the fees for? What service do they provide, these boys who take money from the bikers and the commercial vehicles? Um... A lot. The police cannot harass them. They don't get harassed by the police? That is the primary thing. You would think the police would protect them because that's what the police are for, to protect people. Yeah, to protect people, but sometimes, all over the world, the police can be over-zealous. All these ladies pay a toll as well? Everybody. Can we ask one of them? Yeah. We can. Do you know MC? Yeah. Who is he? Oluomo. Oluomo. Do you know MC? Yes. You know him? Oluomo. Yes. And, do you, er... Do you pay him a fee? No. She's saying she doesn't pay MC. It's more of a political thing. This woman is shy about saying that. She's shy about saying it? You have to pay. Why? Why can't she say that she's paid? She wouldn't say that to you! Why? Partly for security reasons. For security reasons, she won't say? No, no. Come on. You pay. Don't you agree? SPEAKS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE < Where is your permit? SPEAKS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE Who are you? I'm a part of local government. What do you mean? Maybe you do. I work in the National Assembly... So National Assembly will be taking naira without receipt? Let's move on. Get out, my friend! You are the worst selling... It's like you are crazy. You are crazy in the head... ALL TALK AT ONCE ARGUMENT CONTINUES So, what was the man's problem? He's not balanced. He's crazy? He said you should give him money. We should give him money? He wanted money from us? Yes. For what reason? That is why I said the man is not balanced. 'It had been another confusing day in Lagos. 'I'd been struck by how MC had an influence on everyone on the street. 'I wasn't clear on whether the money was going into the union or into his pockets, 'or how willingly it was being paid. 'I was eager to meet the man himself.' Good morning, everyone. EVERYONE: Morning, sir. Get yourself in threes. Don't be more than three... 'I was at the headquarters of KAI, the Kick Against Indiscipline task force.' Those of you here, move back. 'They were created to enforce environmental legislation 'and bring order to the commercial areas of Lagos.' Anybody in life that is lazy is a hopeless person. But when you are very agile and hard working, the reward is there. 'They are commanded by formidable army veteran, Captain Danjuma, 'better known as the KAI master general or the KMG.' 'Ten-shun! < 'Ten-shun! Shut up! Ssh! Don't be stupid! I don't want anybody to disappoint me and my commanders. Don't disappoint this government. The Lagos government have confidence in you. They love you, respect you. They want to take care of you. If we are ready to do all that, you must pay us back by doing good. Am I right? ALL: Yes, sir! You need to do good things? Yes, sir! Looks wonderful. Thank you very much. 'The chief business of the KAI officers is to clear the streets of illegal traders, 'many of whom pay unofficial taxes to area boys.' I want to show you something. 'KAI's target today was a row of shootouts, 'shacks illegally built on a public highway.' All these are illegal structures. They were built on state land. You see, this one we're going to, this is what they are doing. We are demolishing these ones. All these are illegal structures. This is part of the public property? Yes. Here is the perimeter fence. Let me show you so that you know what you are picking. This is the perimeter fence of this property. All these ones are illegal. You can see it has been marked to go. I want you to see it. Is this someone's house? No, it's illegal structures. Who built this? You know, here in Lagos, some people just see space. And they decide to build whatever they want to build. A house? A shop. A shop or a house? A shop! Whose shop is this? Whose shop is this? Come on! Is it your shop? Of course. Do you know why they're smashing up your shop today? I don't know because there is one... Were you served? Did we serve you? Of course. Uh-huh. We served you. We notify you. That this is built on a setback. You were served with a notice? Yes. Why did you refuse to remove your things, where some of you have? Why did you refuse? How do you feel about KAI? Because it affects you. You said you don't like them? He said he likes KAI in some ways. There are other ways... Some ways you like them, some ways you don't like them? You can see, it affect me. Carry, carry. Somebody came and broke my shop. Only God will judge. Only God! They say it was an illegal shop. They're trying to improve the way the area looks, make it look nicer. Please. Thank you. 'I'd had a call from Mamoc. 'MC, the union kingpin had agreed to meet me. 'The venue, his newly built gated mansion. 'With time to kill before the interview, 'Mamoc offered to show me a few of its features.' This is the...? Semi-sitting room. Semi-sitting room. The main sitting room is there. Can you talk me through the pictures? This is Oluomo with a former Miss Commonwealth. A beauty queen. MC with the incumbent executive governor, Fashola. Governor Fashola, the governor of the whole of Lagos state? Yes. The number one? The number one citizen of the state. MC must know Governor Fashola quite well? Yes. Extremely well. Let's look at this one. This is MC, a portrait by some of the youth as a kind of gift. This is the main sitting room. More pictures! I love it. What's this one? It's just on his coronation. See, "On your coronation Oluomo Oshodi." Presented by... UNCLEAR What, he was crowned Oluomo? Yes. As an official kind of title? Yes. It's not a nickname? No. That's the costume of Oluomo? Yes. Is it for his whole life? Yes. There can't be any others? There can't be any other. Hello, how are you doing? Nice to see you. Is he ready for us? Not yet. Until he's ready, we wait here. Yes. This is like the waiting room. Yes. HUSHED VOICES I'd like to know from MC, what is it you do? What is your role here in the Lagos community? Oluomo, he has become like a kind of body. He has become a body that has so many tentacles, branches... But what is it MC does? What's his job? The major thing he does is into transportation. He's a stakeholder in the National Union of Road Transport Workers. He's the state treasurer. He's the state treasurer of the union in charge of many of the commercial vehicles. Yes. How they drive, where they park, that kind of thing. He's in charge of the treasury. Could you ask MC how he sees himself, and what his role is in the community? He sees himself as a privileged person, that God has decided to bless, and he's very humble about it. I feel a bit like I'm interviewing you more than MC Oluomo. Is that OK? Yes. Really? One of the things I understand about MC is that he's involved with youths, some people call them area boys. This term has an association, that it means hoodlums, hooligans. Area boys does not mean hooligans. It means boys in an area. Does it not mean that you're unemployed...? No, no. Maybe you're a youth waiting for work? No, no. No, no, no. No. No. Is he OK? He is OK. NERVOUS LAUGHTER Is it going OK? It's OK. Should we finish? Really, I don't know. 'The question of area boys seemed to be a little sensitive. 'Hoping to get the conversation back on track, I asked for a tour of the house.' So, this is the penthouse. Wow! He monitors everything that happens in the building from here. For security? For security reasons. What's the importance of security? Why would anyone try to hurt MC Oluomo? Why would anyone want to hurt the Pope? Mm. Why would? LAUGHTER Why would? So if somebody would try to hurt the Pope...who are we? So many shoes. He's a very fashionable person. He does his shopping in Italy. Italy? Yes. You go over to Italy to buy the shoes? Yes. Where? Madrid. Madrid? Or Milan. Sorry, Milan. Yes. He goes to Milan and Napoli. Really? To buy the shoes? Yes. How many times? Maybe once in a year. Really? Yes. Maybe you could ask MC what he thinks are the problems that Lagos faces, dealing with. I don't think there is any problem in Lagos. I do not think so. No problems. On the world stage, there's a perception of corruption. If you say Lagos or Nigeria, they say there's a problem with corruption. Is it true? Not Lagos state. The governor of Lagos is a very disciplined person who tries to let you account for every kobo. Every kobo you spend, you must account for it. The governor no want anyone... He doesn't want corruption. At all. He doesn't tolerate it. There's no corruption in Lagos? No known corruption. No known corruption. CHUCKLES Unless there is unknown but I don't know. Do you feel that went OK? Yeah! I love it! I know there's sensitivities around the questions...about the youth. Yes. Yes... Some sensitivity about it. You have to get a bit political, to be careful? Yes. Do you think... Are there things that you can't really talk about? That would be a call. Hello... 'A few days later, there had been an unexpected development. 'MC's authority was under threat from political opponents. 'At stake was his position as union treasurer, and boss of one of Lagos's most lucrative areas.' CHANTING Good to see you. 'MC had mobilised his forces for a show of strength, 'a march on the Lagos government headquarters.' Are you OK? Very well. You're not scared? Me? I'm a samurai, you know! A samurai? In what respect? I'm a samurai in the form of... To be a samurai is a fearless warrior. A disciplined fighter. Yes. Like a knight. Yes. Can you fight? Oh, my goodness! But I don't fight stupidly. Hm. A general selects the battle that they fight. Choose your battle. Choose your battle. 'I'd heard that the campaign for MC to hold on to his position 'might involve the use of force - 'a prospect Mamoc seemed quite familiar with.' The kind of politics that they play in the west, is quite... extremely different from the politics in this part of the world. In the west, it's not a do or die thing. Here, it's a do or die thing. Is it? It is a do or die thing. How often do people die? Oh! We don't take stock! We don't take stock of that! Who is? The governor, did you say? Yes. Lagos state governor? Yes. Governor Fashola? Yes. He's coming out? Yes. This rally... It's a form of protective rally for their offices too. Why would political parties want to control the leadership of the union? Mobilise the youth? For the nation. They get the youth to vote a certain way and to influence members of the public? Yes. CHEERING Transportation is the bedrock of modern civilisation. I assure you that I will make a representation on your behalf to Mr President, before the end of business today. 'Governor Fashola seems keen to soothe the crowd's fears.' Have a good day. Thank you very much. That is all over. Let's go. A good result? Yes. A good result. 'But as the demo came to a close, rumours circulated that MC might be forced to call an election. 'Mamoc was unworried about the outcome, but a clash of some kind seemed likely. 'Over the next few days, I was invited by MC and Mamoc 'to join them at a variety of social events. 'As well as being a union leader, 'MC found time for a busy schedule of parties. 'Whatever the true nature of the union and his authority, 'MC was well known in Lagos and admired as a kind of celebrity. 'Among his appearances was another Muslim celebration, 'as which he was guest of honour and eulogised by the local cleric. 'But outside, the mood changed. 'A crowd of young men gathered around MC and a popular musician, 'as they sat on top of one of MC's cars.' It could turn violent? You think we should leave now? Yeah. I don't understand why he gives money if it's going to start trouble. Why not give money on a different occasion, when it's quieter? They expect that from him? Yeah. They expect that from him. VOICES SHOUT 'In a strange display, he left his car behind and reappeared, 'striding along the road, leading a mob of excited youths.' CAR HORN BLASTS Is everything all right? Definitely. 'MC's car had caught up with him and, from somewhere, 'he produced a wad of money, which he handed to one of the youths.' He's given him a big lump of money. They're not boys that work for him. No. They are just street boys. Just street youths? Yeah. Who are out of work and need money? Exactly. Please, we have to leave now. Why? Are we not safe now? 'I felt I'd had an insight into how MC maintained his popularity, 'using a kind of street theatre and an instinctive ability to connect 'with the poorest of Lagos society. 'I was back with KAI, 'staging a mission to clean up the streets in an area called Bariga.' 'The main target today, the stalls built illegally over open drains, 'and any shopkeepers who put up resistance. 'There was concern that local area boys may try to defend their turf.' Are you in charge of the police back-up? Yeah. So you just provide back-up and make sure everything goes smoothly? Yes. Do they give you much trouble? These people...? SHOUTS ANGRILY Why was he taken away, the man? Very stubborn. This is electricity. These are the lights. Electricity. This side... Selling markets. He's built his little shack around the pylons carrying the electricity? Who's in charge of the area boys here? Do you know? Hello, sir. How are you? Fine. You're in charge here a little bit? Are you? So you give out the tickets to the drivers? Yes. Do you know MC Oluomo? I know him very well. He's the state treasurer. Do you like him? Why not? He's our boss. I love him. What do you think about what KAI are doing today? Do you like it? We like it. We want Lagos to be clean. Do you? We like it. Some of the area boys would be protecting the illegal traders. No, no. In Bariga, we don't do that. We don't do that in Bariga. Commander, does that happen sometimes? It does happen. Yes. Anywhere in Lagos. ..if we know they want to overpower us, then we come back with back-up. Then we can achieve what we want to achieve. He controls the boys in the area, is that fair to say? Of course. That's all over the area. HORNS HONK CONSTANTLY 'Back in the world of MC, though he was still in control of the union, 'he had been forced to call an election to reaffirm his legitimacy. 'I was keen to get back to the grassroots of the union. 'I wanted to understand more about the low-level area boys and the lives they led. 'Local fixer, Afilabi Martins offered to introduce me to a small-time gang. Its boss was Raji.' How do you do? I'm Louis. < Raji. ANGRY SHOUTING SHOUTS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE 'Before I'd reached their hang-out, I'd already caused a problem.' VIOLENT SHOUTING What is the problem? I will explain all to you. Be patient, we are almost there. Let us go. There's no problem. People are claiming that...especially that man, was mentioning that the youths, of course, are children. But they did not inform them that they are having guests or visitors in the neighbourhood. All is settled. These are your boys? Yes. Who cut you? Someone from outside? Why? Razzaq. I'm Louis. Razzaq. Louis. I'm Cross And Die. Cross? And Die. What does that mean? If you cross his way, you die. That's your name? Why? SPEAKS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE ALL SPEAK AT ONCE That's Louis. My name is Marisol. Marisol? Marisol. Where do you work? I don't have work. I'm an area boy. You're an area boy? Yeah. You control an area? I control Peti. Do you get money from controlling Peti? I'll go round to their shop. Collecting money. If they don't want to give money, I give them slap. I can collect money by force. 'Despite the rowdiness of the group, they all owed allegiance to Raji.' What do you do? SPEAKS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE OK, Raji cannot really express himself in English. Maybe I need to answer this. He's talking about National, the union, National Union of Road and Transport Workers. So he's a member. Is he? Yeah. So you're from the union, then you also... You make money from...shops? Yes. Yes. For protection? Yes. He said he secures the district. From that point, to the end of the road. Who do you protect from? From crime? Are there gangs? From police? Who from? SPEAKS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE If somebody comes, I mean an outsider, or boys within the environment go out to steal or come into the area, gets rid of him or such persons, out. Can you fight? Yes. How? Bottle and cutlass. Bottle and cutlass? Yes. You've done that? Is that where these...? Yes. I don't like fight. Why do you fight? I don't know why. We don't have jobs. We need good job. We need job. You need a good job? Yeah, we want to work with our own hands. We need job. We don't want to fight. We don't want to worry. We want peace. But we need job. There is no job. Louis, wait! Wait! Wait! SHOUTING HE SINGS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE 'My encounter with Raji's boys took a last unexpected turn 'when the man known as Cross And Die serenaded us as we left.' SINGS IN LOCAL LANGUAGE How does he control an area? He controls an area based on the power of his name. He has a jurisdiction whereby he controls and collects money from businesses and shops. These people give him money or he extorts money? Which is it? You see, there are two dimensions to read now. Er... In Nigeria today, especially where someone is well advanced in the neighbourhood, people think he has a right for him to collect money from them. Under normal circumstances, the money he collects is illegal. But he sees it more of the reality that comes to him. It's illegal, but it is widely tolerated. There is an element of consent. Yes. There's an element of consent. Nobody sees it as a wrong practice. 'For the first time, I felt I understood how deeply 'the culture of area boys reached into the civic structure of Lagos. 'The city and its institutions had been hijacked by gangs. 'I also felt an empathy for the plight of the area boys, 'born into poverty, leading lives of desperation and violence. 'I was on my way back to see Mamoc. 'The union election to reaffirm MC's legitimacy had taken place that morning. 'He was keen that I should share the hour of triumph. 'Outside the union headquarters, MC's supporters were celebrating. 'It seemed MC had run unopposed, thereby making victory a certainty. 'Among the crowd were men in bloodstained shirts.' What happened? How did you get...? Have you got a...? Hello? How did you get hurt? SPEAK IN LOCAL LANGUAGE CAR HORNS BLAST GUNSHOTS GUNSHOT Is everything OK? Back there somewhere, stuck in the traffic. What are you doing? Is everything... Is everything OK? There's a slightly weird atmosphere. VOICES ALL SHOUT AT ONCE Go inside! PANICKED SHOUTS HEATED CONVERSATION Is everything all right? What's happening? The aggrieved party, they're making some kind of violence. That is why you are seeing some guys brutalised and bloodshed. That is why MC just wants you people protected. So that you just get in the vehicle and just rescue you away from here. Why were they firing the gun? They have to use everything to protect him. From the crowd? Of course. The aggrieved party might not want to allow him to go free. The aggrieved party? The opposition? Yes. Which is who? I don't know. You should understand that it's not everybody that wants to support him. Everyone in that crowd seemed to like him. Yes. But he still has to protect himself. 'A little later, we reconvened outside a popular hotel in Ashodi. 'Revellers, some of them police, helped themselves to free alcohol. 'The mood was upbeat, any concern about youths from an opposition camp 'had now gone.' Why do you mix your wine with stout? BLAST OF VUVUZELA 'After the excitement of the day's events, 'I found myself unwinding with some of MC's supporters.' GUNSHOTS Is he a policeman? Yes. He's a policeman. Was that a real gun? Why was he firing his gun? There are some factions who don't support.. Why? We are more than them. 'I felt I'd had a glimpse behind the scenes at the way the union really functioned, 'ruling the streets through its cohorts of boys 'and headed by its enigmatic treasurer, MC. 'My time in Lagos was nearly up. 'I'd been invited for one last outing with KAI, with the KMG. 'He was making a tour of some of the KAI forces. 'The target wasn't illegal traders or area boys, but people who were not cleaning their houses.' I'm not satisfied. I want you to arrest as many as possible. All right? I trust you. I want you to arrest as much as possible. 'They were enforcing a law making the last Saturday of every month an environmental clean-up day. 'All Lagos residents were required to be at home.' What is your name? Sunday, sir. Sunday. What is today? Saturday. What do you do today? Environmental. Environmental. Environmental? Good boy. God bless you. Who is this man? Sorry, sir... Why didn't you arrest this man? He's doing his environmental. He's cleaning the street. No, he's not. I met him sitting down. What's happening in here? The process is what we want to do. What happened with your little baby? You are travelling? Why are you travelling? You know English? Huh? Is she deaf and dumb? Leave this woman to go. OK, sir. And warn them. Next time they don't do that. The ones with little children, allow them to go. You're showing mercy to these? Yes. I have to because of the children. We fear God. You must have the fear of the almighty God. When I see things like this, we should temper mercy. Let's go. Get me a cold beer out. OK, sir. Yes. 'Back at the KAI HQ, the KMG broke out some refreshments.' What do you see as the biggest challenges you face doing your work? My greatest problem now is I need more troops and I need more vehicles. Do you ever worry that you catch the small fry, the little guys who are trying to make a living, albeit in an illegal way...? Go on. Street traders, hawkers, people like that. But that the big people behind the scenes... Yes. The Mafia types... I understand. They're not being caught. The godfathers. Yes. The area fathers. As far as I'm concerned, it's possible such a thing is existing. There's one funny game I play. As soon as they are detained, and I noticed they are so-called godfathers and godmothers, I send them to court straight away. What if they don't come into the compound? It's not my business to look for them. My concern is the suspect doing that bad thing. They're not the ones carrying the goods for sale, they're behind the scenes running protection rackets. The godfathers are the ones behind those ones carrying things for sale. I repeat. As soon as those suspects are arrested and detained here before prosecution, if those godfathers and godmothers stroll in with any type of story, trying to play on my intelligence, I take them to court. That's what I'm saying. I'm talking Queen's English, you know? I worry that there are guys behind the scenes... I understand. You are just recycling one issue. There's no need recycling. If you are innocent, I don't arrest you. Where you are against the law, I have to arrest you. The law of the land will be obeyed. 'With my visit coming to an end, I thought I'd check in with Mamoc. 'Having been helped and guided by him for much of my time in Lagos, 'I owed it to him to share my misgivings about MC and his world.' Shall we see how much is in there? It's not for me. It's money. Can we see? I'm not too sure! Can we have a quick look? It is money. It's just money. It's just money. It's just money. Just money. Those are 1000s. There's more. Can I get another one? No. No. Let's put it back. I don't want to put myself in trouble. Is there money in that? No. This is just a bag. You work for MC quite closely. Yeah. Are you in any way troubled by the little bits of violence that are in the background that you hear about? Yeah... You know. It all depends on your own point of view. In this part of the world, there's something I've come to understand which is... The way of the Caribbeans are not the way of the Americans. The way of the Irish are sometimes not the way of the British. It has become like a way of life in this part of the world. In Lagos, there's a system where areas have an area father or godfather, and he's in charge. Yes. And, to some extent, he's unaccountable. Yes. He's his own law in his area. He has so much influence and respect in his area. Of course, but... The question is, do you think that's a good system? There is nowhere in the world where you don't have people you account for. Even in Britain. Even in Britain, the Queen is so powerful... Are you making an analogy with the Queen and MC? Yes. What I'm wondering is, is that good to have someone who is not really... formally part of the government...? He is part of the government. He's part of the union, technically. He's a politician.
