The man to be killed is a certain... Luca canali, a pimp from Milan. He worked for Don vito tressoldi's family but was worthless. After a couple of years Don vito got rid of him and he ended up in the world of prostitution. Now he's tried a big job. You have to kill him without hiding it, so that the whole of Milan will talk about it. The whole of Italy must talk about it. Everyone must know you came from New York, to hunt down Luca canali and squash him like a louse. That you came to Milan, you played like the bosses and then you left. They must know that who screws up has got no chance, That New York itself deals with it and takes on the task of filling their mouth with lead. This is our man in Milan, Luca canali. Luca, the baron and peppinello are fighting! - Come! - Excuse me. I'll knock you senseless! I'll make you see stars! Let's have some manners! No playing games! Goodbye, guys. He sometimes faints. Peppinuccio! Get up, boy! Damiano! Once you have killed him, there will be an airplane waiting for you at a private airport in Milan. It will take you to Switzerland. Our last cargo of heroin hasn't arrived. They pretended to load it in Milan and they stole it. They committed a very big mistake. My interpol friends tell me that stuff was sold elsewhere and not confiscated. The man who stole it is becoming powerful. We have to stop him from becoming even more powerful. We have to force him to give himself away. We may not need to, seeing that the information is correct. I don't want him killed in any old place, but on an opening night at the scala theatre and then hung from the duomo. I want it to be spectacular! Obviously, our friends in Milan do not know they have a traitor amongst them. I didn't mention it to tressoldi. I would rather you dealt with it. Tressoldi might not like the fact it's us that take action in Milan. If he can't look after his own men, we'll teach him how! First, you'll go to him to ask him to cooperate. He has to hand Luca canali over to you, but you are the ones that must kill him. The Italians have a strange type of gangster in mind, they see him being exactly like you, and you have to dress and act like gangsters. Drink, leave big tips, put your feet on tables, they hate that in Italy. You have to act the part so that everyone knows who you are. That's why I chose you. Here is everything you need. There's a woman waiting for you, she knows nothing, but she'll take you round the city. I chose you because he fought in Italy... And because I am of Italian descent. Right, and because you both speak Italian. The Italian connection - Bye, girls. - Bye. - Do you know her? - Yes and I know the blonde one too. - They are all under-age. - All under-age whores, you mean. 100,000 liras a time, let's say 5 times a week, that's 20 a month. - How much does that make? - Two million liras! That's not bad, for an under-age worker! They never take a break and with the overtime... Just think how much they make! Look who it is, miss Kenneth! She arrived yesterday and already I have to order another crate of j&b. Goodbye. Good morning. I'm Eva lalli, are you Mr. David catania? - Yes. - Your passports, please. Thanks. "West Lionel import" made a reservation for an apartment. Here are Mr. catania and Mr. Webster's passports. - If you would like to go up... - Of course, Eva. This is Milan, not Stockholm. - [Ce? - I don't drink alcohol. - Aren't you having a drink? - I had one at the bar. Here's to our good health! He's teetotal. Mr. catania, I'm going. Tell me when you want me to come back. Stop this Mr. catania business, my name's David. - And he's frank. - Alright. There's a Pontiac with a Milan number plate in the garage for you. If you need anything whatsoever, I know half of Milan. Are you leaving? I don't have to leave, I'm on call 24 hours for you. I can wait at the reception for you, I just need to change. I'm getting changed too. I'll wait downstairs so I don't have to see you change your underwear. What were we saying? If you know half of Milan, do you by chance know Luca canali? I've never heard of him, he must belong to the other half. He can't be very powerful. No, he's not. He's a pimp... How do you call them in French? - Macro. - Yes, macro. I'd like to see him again. - Where can we find him? - I wouldn't know. Maybe at the "four stars", those sort of men always go there, it's full of gorgeous girls. Hot chicks? Yes. Perfect! See you later, Mr. catania... I mean David. Frank. Bye. Do you think I could get hold of Eva? Listen to me, David, don't go chasing the first girl you see. We're here for Don vito tressoldi. Don vito tressoldi is waiting for us, I mustn't go chasing the first girl I see and we're here for work. But there's life in Milan and wherever I am, I live it up. Rita! Hi dad! - I'm here, dad! - My little girl! How are you? Didn't mommy tell you I'm better now? Yes, she told me. What have you brought me? Something really beautiful. Let me see! - You look at it, though. - Yes, dad. Hi. Today is Thursday. It's visit day, isn't it? Yes, she has a check-up with the doctor, but she's much better. She exercises. I won it at a fun fair, last night, and I thought she would have liked it. It's really great, thanks dad. Take 1t, it's for the girl's treatment. Thanks. I'll use 1t for the doctor. Thanks for accepting it. - Have you started smoking again? - Occasionally. Lucia, why don't you let me help you always? Don't say it again. I'll keep saying it. You have to forget about us, Luca. Rita's growing up, she mustn't know what you do. Dad, look, he walks by himself! Play with me. I love you so much, my little girl! Dog, where's your muzzle? In New York they tell me you're okay. They say you have to tell me why you've come here. You're here now. I'm not usually curious, but today I am. What can you do in Milan that I can't do‚Äù we want Luca canali. I think he has the women at parco lambro. One of the guys will know him for sure. We'll wrap him up and send him to you. We want canali alive. You want him alive? Who said anything about wasting a bullet on a pimp? Corso was right in not calling me and telling me the reason. It'll be no problem. Go and have some fun, and tomorrow we'll give you... Mr. canali, alive. Next time I'll bring you a bone. Fuck off! This is the first time corso sends men from New York and with the excuse... Of the parco lambro pimp! Corso's not stupid, maybe he knows. Damiano, it stinks! I've got an idea. If Luca canali comes, tell him that two American guys are waiting for him at that table. - Alright. - You know if he'll come tonight? I think so. - Don't forget! - Thanks, there's no need. Carlo! Who was that handsome foreigner? Did you call me? Does a certain Luca canali come here? Yes, but not always. - Do you know him? - Yes. What's he like? He has beautiful black hair, like Samson! - Waiter! - Yes. Who's this dickhead that called me? Invite her over here. - Which one? - The one with the blue wig. - You mean trini? - Yes, bring her here. I can ask her, but she's not that type of girl. - She's not a hostess? - No, not at all. - So she's a whore then. - She's just a young rebel. I've never liked rebels. Tell her I'll give her 100,000 liras if she'll have a drink with us. I'll try. - Do you think she'll come? - I'm absolutely sure. It's not easy to find an idiot who offers you 100,000 liras for a drink. Trini! They're giving away 100,000 liras at that table. Come and get it! - Will you give me the money now? - I always pay up front. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. I sent a friend of mine to get some smoke. What are you doing? Why are you sitting there? I saw you first. That's not true. I told you straight away I wasn't interested. How come you're in an Italian nightclub? Are you too old to play butcher in Vietnam? - Do you know Luca canali? - Yes, I know him. If you're after girls, he'll get them. You won't have me. - Does he come here? - Rarely. He's not allowed to work here. I haven't seen him in twenty years, you know, we're so far... I wonder what he's up to. So do I. I haven't seen him in a long time. Is there a place where we can find him? If you had offered me 100,000 liras, I wouldn't have taken it. If I had seen you, I would have rushed over to you. - Shall we go to bed? - I don't feel like it. This 1s the "four stars", right? Which club does Luca canali usually go to? - He's not allowed to work in clubs. - Where can we find him? Let's make a deal. I'll tell you where he is and I'll stay here with him. You two go and find Luca and I'll get him to feel like doing something! - Where is my sigfrido staying? - At the impero hotel. Luca works in the parco lambro area. Bye. When the football match ison TV, the girls don't earn a cent. But that game show, "risk it all", spoils it for us too. The TV should be shut down! - How much do you want? - 10,000 liras. - What about you? - 10,000 liras. - And you? - I'll give you 5,000 liras, dear.. Ilf you'll fuck off! - You fuck off! - Really! - Do you want some company? - Go to hell! Go easy! Hooray! Here! There's enough for everyone! Here! This is for you and this is for you! Come on, girls! Put it here. What a beauty! Look! Isn't it beautiful? These are dollars! Give it to me! Give me my wallet, don't be stupid! - We'll show you! - Let's not fight. Fuck off! Give it to him! - I'll kill him! - Stab him! Come on, guys! I'll kill him! Saint gennaro! Holy Mary! Where will we put 600 million Chinese people when they come? There will always be a place for mao - Who is 1t? - Luca, it's trini. - Who? - Trini. Trini! - How are you, my darling? - Fine. Do you want to start working? I'd get good money for you! Listen. You decide the percentage. You know how much money you'd make? With your thighs you'll buy a house in a month! Me and you would be such a great couple that even Jackie and onassis... Would want us! Listen to me. Two American guys are looking for you, one of them told me he's known you for a long time but! Don't like the look of him. I know, there was a punch-up at parco lambro last night, but let's not change the subject. They looked a bit sinister. I liked the black one, I'd have screwed him, but I didn't like the white one. They're staying at the impero hotel. Alright. So, do you want to work for me? Stop it, Luca! I like you, you helped me when I was in the hospital. I know you only did it because you felt sorry for me. If you must know, I find you repulsive. - But you mean well. - Is that an insult? Bye, Luca. What whore where you talking to? - Trini's not a whore. - Yes, shes. She's a whore. You're the whore! I'm a whore and so is trini! You are, for sure. She's a whore! She's into free love, you get paid for it! That's what it's called now, but she's more of a whore than me! More... is what she'd make compared to you. If she got herself a better pimp than you! What do you mean? You said you'd take me off the street and get me a place! If you don't earn it yourself, how can I? Do you want me to go stealing? Is that what you want? What's wrong with that? Go and start stealing! You can't because you've got no balls! You've got no balls! It's not a question of balls, but I'm not a criminal. I won't go stealing for a whore like you. Fuck off! Anna, you can't complain. You're hardly on the streets now. You bring your clients to the beauty parlour. - You should be happy. - Really? How long for? One or two months, then the cops will come and what'll I do? If I had a house, I wouldn't let the cops in. If I have a house in my name, I won't let the police in! - This is in your name. - For the rent! I want my own house. And you don't want me to bring my clients here. Go on, let me bring them here. It's so easy! - Let's fix some times. - Alright then. Bring who you like. Good morning, Don Luca. - Luca, good morning! - Hi. Luca, Don vito tressoldi wants to see you. - He wants to see me? - That's right. - Why does he want to see me? - You've become powerful. You're international now, they've come from America for you! Come with me. Get in. - Why does he want me? - You're not wanted. Where are we going? Shut up, I'll tell you when to speak. This 1s no way to treat a man! Watch your mouth, unless you want to spit blood! Make the phone call, quick. He's with us at the carpenter's, you can come. We'll wait here. Alright. What's all this wood for? Coffins? - I just asked a question. - I'll give you an answer. Luca canali, you're a queer! Take this! - Come on! - Stop it! Your head's only good for keeping your ears apart! You faggot! Is that the impero hotel? Are two American guys staying there? Yes, a white quy and a black guy. Yes, alright. I'll hold. You want Luca canali? He's at the carpenter's shop, 6km along the road to monza. But you'll also find Don vito tressoldi. We'll be back soon. You let him get away, didn't you? - Let me explain! - Explain what? The bird has taken flight. And now he's flying, flying... I wonder where he's flying to! He won't go far, you have tressoldi's word. He'll have stopped flying by tonight. You have some jerks working for you. And only dickheads hire jerks! Remember who you're talking to! I won't forget, I don't know who you are! We came to pay homage to you but we wanted Luca canali, and you said you'd give him to us. Someone we know won't like to hear about this. Your guys have been marked by you and by Luca canali, but those marks fade. And when the marks fade, so does fear, but fear must never go away! Now, tell that to your men, Mr. tressoldi. And remember, we came to Milan with serious intentions. You know that, make sure the others do too. My intentions are more serious than yours. Tell that to who sent you. You scared me! Why are you still in Milan? They're looking for you. They even came to the house. - Where can I hide? - You're asking me? - I thought you'd left already. - Listen... - You have to give me a hand. - Give you a hand? They'll cut my hand off, if I help you. They told me. - What did they want? - To know where you were. They gave me 500,000 liras because I might be the first to see you. I won't tell them, but disappear! Don't get me into trouble, go! You can't leave me like this! I've already left you, big boy! I don't want to get involved. If they find out I'm talking to you, they'll throw acid in my face. Leave, go on! If you stay here, you're dead! Remember, I'll tell them you forced me to listen to you. Before, I said I wouldn't but I will tell them, because I couldn't care less about you! You're a nobody, Luca canali. You used to be good for me, because you were good for tressoldi. You're dead and buried now. What do you want from me? I'm not an undertaker! Don vito means power, wealth, he's got everyone at his feet! What's been happening? Tressoldi's men came looking for you. They looked pretty mean. They know we're friends, they grilled me and they'll be back. Everyone knows, it's a priority for tressoldi. There's a reward for you. Can you hide me? - You'd be better off out of Milan. - I can't get there. I know a place. At carmine's house, let's hope they haven't been there. - You know where it is? - Yes. - Have you got any weapons? - I've never had any. Where can I get some? But not from the usual guys. From enrico, the mechanic. He has some, but they're expensive. I've got money. When can I meet you at carmine's house? - As soon as I finish work. - See you later. - Hi, Luca. - Hi, enrico. Have you got a car for sale? That's not why I'm here, I need a gun. Why does a pimp need a gun? Women are dirty business! - The money? - I have it. I may have something for you. Wait in there for me. Do you know how to use them? Look at these! Have you got bullets and a silencer? I have everything you need. Take this one, it's small but powerful. I want this one. This one? It's hot, it's killed a man already. How much? For you, 200,000 liras. Alright, give me the bullets. How much did you want to spend? What you said. Get me about 50 bullets. Alright. I've got customers. I'll be right back. Have you got nothing to say, enrico? You got here before I called you! We don't want to, but we believe you. But a good informer has to be quick. Don't worry, he has the gun but no bullets. We're not worried. Are you covering for him? He hasn't even got a real man's job. A mechanic is better then a pimp! Good. Go on, we'll come in after you. Don't leave your customer waiting. - Canlgoin? - Go on. - The bullets. - I'll get them. Who are those two guys? They wanted to know if I had a car park. They've gone now. But we're here now. Enrico is a liar and he doesn't call when he has visitors. Throw the gun down, you don't need it. Throw it! Enrico is clever, he sells guns with no bullets. Don vito tressoldi wants you. - Move it! - Come on, dickhead! Put your hands down. Give me the bullets. Alright, come on. But they're not dead. Yes, they're dead. Here they are. - Don't you want the other gun? - You said it was still warm. What are you playing at, Luca? 100 men are looking for you, everyone's been informed. Why? Don vito wants you alive and I have to tell you, he's offering a reward to the man who brings you to him. The word is he'll be godfather to the man who brings you to him. I don't believe that, it'd be too much. Thanks. What about those two? Take them to Don vito and get him to be your godfather. - You want some advice? - No. Which one of these cars has a full tank? Take that one, the engine's good. - If you see me again... - Alright. Goodbye, Luca. Don vito is a respectable man, I choose him over you. He's too big for his boots! We'll send you home, got that? Get her, francesco! Don't shout! No one can hear you! Are you still seeing Luca? We'll carry you on the palms of our hands! It's Luca canali, I know that Don vito wants me. Luca canali, are you playing boss now? You take but you don't give, you've forgotten who I am? What? Your men never said it was you that wanted me. But you knew who they were. But I didn't know what they wanted. They didn't tell me. I know. They are uneducated idiots. Anyhow, I called you straight away. And why didn't you come? Are your shoes hurting you? - What do you want from me? - Come here and we'll talk. I'm here. Come quickly, I'm a busy man. Hold on a moment! Forgive me, just tell me what... A woman has been complaining about your cut of her earnings. Damiano knows everything. Come here and we'll talk. If that's all it is... I sent for you and you didn't come. Come by. Say sorry to the guys and speak to damiano. And bring me a nice bunch of flowers. - Alright? - Just a moment. That woman and my friends dumped me because you were after me. And you're worrying about a whore and a bunch of idiots? Everyone knows you want me. My wish is a command. You know everyone likes me. I'm waiting for you, Luca canali. But what do those American guys want then? What American guys? The ones that came to the carpenter's. They're looking everywhere for me. Tell me something, how are your wife and daughter? I know your daughter goes to primary school. It's good to give her an education, you're a modern man. Nowadays women must go to school too. So... Will you bring me those flowers or will they be for someone else? It makes no difference to me. Don vito! What have my wife and daughter got to do with this? Lucia, where's our daughter? At school, where do you think? Go and get her. Leave for a few days. Are you crazy? You think I can just walk out and leave? - How will I cope with no money? - Don't worry about that. Your women's money disgusts me. And you disgust me for taking it! Don't give me any more. Lucia, for god's sake, go and get our girl and leave now! I have a debt with Don vito tressoldi. I swear to you that I don't know what it's about. Why don't you pay off this debt? Your life is affecting ours too! Staying away from you hasn't helped me! Go to Don vito! I will, but there's no time now! Go to the school then leave! Here! First steps dance school for children Rita! Holy Mary! Stop! This is private property! If I catch you, you'll be sorry! Really? My dear tressoldi, you didn't tell me there were other powerful men in Milan apart from you. If you can't manage by yourself, just let me know. I think we underestimated Luca canali. He's not an easy catch, he's fooled us three times! Our men are trying to get him alive, but he shoots. Of course! If you send idiots after him, he's at an advantage! You sent the one who plays James Bond, who was the other quy? You must forgive them. One was gustavino and the other one was piero panunzio. His mom had begged me to give him work. If a man needs his mother's prayers, he's useless! Damiano, things are messed up and it's not by chance. Canali has started a war. We've been put to shame by a loser! It doesn't make sense. What do those American guys really want? Maybe corso is still angry... About the stolen heroin. - Does he know it was us? - He might. But what do those two American guys really want? Luca canali? How can they think... That this loser pulled off a three billion liras job? We have to kill canali and make sure the American guys go back home. They wanted him alive? We'll give him to them dead. Until canali was only a name in New York, everything was okay, but if they see him, they'll know it was us. Then canali might shoot the American guys and if he does, the bang will be heard in New York. Enough talking, shoot! I'll pass on the order. Canali 1s dead, all he can do is walk. Don't worry, Don vito, he can only walk. Kill him. - Hi, trini. - Hi. - Eva, who are those two guys? - What do you mean who are they? Tell me, who are they? Two American tourists. - Don't tell me who they look like. - Who are they? I reckon they are two killers. Bye. I was waiting for you, come in. I asked, it seems no one came looking for you here. - Want a bite to eat? - Thanks. No one wants to hurt you. You disgust me, Nicola. You're wrong, tressoldi just wants to see you. They killed my wife and daughter! That's enough, let's go. One moment. - Did they really kill them? - Shut up, Nicola! It was an accident. Tressoldi warned me, they were run over by a Van. You sons-of-bitches! Why did you kill his wife and daughter? - Don vito tressoldi gave the order. - Don't mention any names. - He's got nothing to do with it. - Let's go. I'm not coming alive. Nicola, don't be stupid, come here! Nicola... I'm sorry, I asked for it. No, you did it for me. I never wanted this, not for you. What happened, Luca? I could say anything right now, but I know nothing. When I saw my little girl was dead... Why were you involved in all this? Call trini for me. There's a guy asking for you. Luca! - Hi, trini. How are you? - Comein. There's a lot of people. Can I spend the night here? That's a great team. It's strong and fast. Now that rececconi has gone, I wonder what'll happen! Hey, you! You! You heard me? What do you want? Stay in the corridor! Canali's here! What have you done? Have you finished making trouble in my house? - You told me to come. - Luca canali... You think I'm scared of dying? No, not like this. I won't die like a fool, shot by a loser like you! Let's sit down and talk. I don't know what those American guys want from you, but Mr. corso is very angry, it must be something serious. Something serious? What's it got to do with me? I'm just a loser, like you said. Why are you shitting your pants then? Listen, you louse, remember you're speaking to Don vito tressoldi. My name means something, you're just a nobody. You were a nobody even for that whore of your wife. My wife was not a whore. You want to know why you were going to get killed? Yes, I want to know. Why did you have my wife and daughter killed? Why did you hunt me down and make me kill all those people? Why have those Americans come to hunt down a man like me? Tell me, Don vito! Alright. I did a dirty on New York. I don't need them anymore. I wanted to work on my own. I did a dirty on them and I had to give them someone's name. And you gave them mine. I'm too small a fish for such a big bite. I can help you. No, it's too late. Don't tell me what I can do! I've kept ministers and judges on their toes. You're offering me a grave, but I won't accept it from you. Until yesterday you slithered like a worm to enter this house, in order to see me! Only I can stop the hit-men and send the Americans home. - They won't go. - We'll send them home together. Now I know you're a worthy man, I saw how you acted. How could a man like you be a pimp? It's too late, there's nothing you can do. I already told you, fear made me strong. This is not the time to give up. I can't believe you'll be so stupid after all you've done. Think it over, before killing me. Forget about your daughter for a moment. The Americans won't leave and even if they did, others would come, tomorrow, next month or next year. You know that. I've played out of my league. I didn't calculate the risks, giving them you as bait. But you played big time too. You think you can handle them? You can't. It's been alright for you so far, but look what cards you've been dealt. They're worthless. You'll be sorry. I won't be alive then, but think of me at that moment. Now shoot and aim well, Luca. One shot. No. Shoot me in the chest and look me straight in the eyes. Show me you're the man I think you are. It's Luca canali, Don vito was double-crossing and I killed him. Mr. canali? Where can we meet? I'm being followed, it's dangerous for me. It's important that we meet. At the 25th km on the road for turin, there's a junk yard. I'll be there, you know where it is? We'll get there, see you soon. You're coming with us. Naughty little cat! Come here! Get in front! Watch out, they'll kill you! Go away! Go away! Go! He's heading towards our car, cut him off! Shoot the tires! Canali, I'm coming! Canali! The end
