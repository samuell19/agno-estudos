MOSFILM CINE CONCERN COURIER STUDIOS and SPEC-FILM "Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives and his concubines, might drink therein. In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote upon the wall of the king's palace. Then the tsar's countenance was changed in him. And the queen told him: 'Now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.' Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And Daniel said to the king: 'O Belshazzar, 'thou hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; 'and thou have drunk wine in the vessels of his house; 'and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, 'of brass, iron, wood and stone, 'which see not, nor hear, nor know: 'and the God in whose hand thy breath is, 'and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.' 'Then was the part of the hand sent from him. 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation: 'MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished. 'TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 'PERES; Thy kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.' In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. Oleg YANKOVSKY Malcolm McDOWELL in Karen SHAKHNAZAROV'S THE ASSASSIN OF THE TSAR Rysakov was the first to see Perovskaya give a sign. We understood the tsar had altered the route. He wasn't going to M. Sadovaya where a mine had been placed. Then we went towards Ekaterininsky Canal: along its embankment Alexander II used to ride to Winter Palace. ...Mikhailov was to start it, but Rysakov was the closest. So he threw the first bomb. ...Alexander II approached Rysakov and asked him: 'Who are you?' 'Philistine Glazov,' said Rysakov. 'Indeed,' the tsar remarked, turned around and walked towards me. I stepped his way... I saw none of the tsar anymore. But I saw a boy. He was lying five steps away from me. Someone remarked: 'A wounded boy.' And someone else said: 'No, he's dead already.' I was mortally wounded and brought to a hospital. Where I died several hours thereafter. I came to, before dying, and was asked questions. 'What is your name?' 'What is your name?' I said: 'I don't know.' Timofeev, tell Doctor how it all started. I was in prison in Yakutia after the Army. It was because of a petty brawl. I served my term, and I stayed there. I was felling trees. ...Once, quite stoned, I walked towards the barrack. It was fierce frost, and me wearing no felt boots. Hence - each of my foots missing a finger. So... it all started after the operation. I started seeing an apparition of a girl Eve. - That was her name? - Sure. Eve. About 5 years of age. Donning a red dress, canary boots. And she said to me: 'Timofeev! 'You are no Timofeev. You killed 'the tsars Alexander II and Nicholas II.' And she started telling me all the details, how it all happened. Does this girl Eve come again and again? No. She stopped coming. How long have you been taking the treatment? For 18 years, in many asylums. Wouldn't you like to be discharged? Of course, I would like to live a bit of a free life. Very well. Go to your ward now. Thank you, Doctor. Maybe we should discharge Timofeev? - Stabilized condition, eh? - Yes, if he doesn't take to drinking. His sister has disowned him. He has no home now. I wanted to transfer him to Yaroslavl. They bend rules for them there, can give him a room. Yaroslavl is a good idea. Petya, please meet our new doctor. - Smirnov. - Kozlov, an orderly. So, you are leaving us? Yes, good luck. Don't you feel sad, to retire? Well, you know, I feel tired. I guess I'll go to my daughter in the Crimea. But as long as I'm here - you're welcome. How come you landed here, in our hole? You were a Ministry man, worked in the capital. I had my reasons. I was after interesting cases. I'm a physician, after all. Also, I got divorced recently. We've a daughter. And I have no views on my wife's apartment. Then I was offered a situation here. Well, maybe you did the right thing. - See you. - See you. How do you feel, Timofeev? I'm all right. What is this? - Where did you get this? - I don't know. - What happened last night here? - Nothing. - Why this scar? - I don't know. Where did you get it? What were you doing at night? I was sleeping. Petr Sergeevich. I wouldn't like our hospital be noised about for its violence offered instead of treatment. Do you mean we were strangling Timofeev? I don't know what happened here. But I want to know the truth. No one strangled him, nor did he try to hang himself. This cyanotic scar he had last year too. You can check by his case history. You can ask Alexander Egorovich. It is going to disappear in a couple of days. Very well. Apply a dressing. Good evening. Good evening. I came home and saw your note. Yes, I wanted to see you. Thanks for coming. Sorry, I'm not alone. - I'll come tomorrow then. - No, it's alright. - Hi. - Hi. - Marina. - Alexander Egorovich. I need to have a word with Alexander Egorovich. - Shall I leave? - Why, no. Why should you leave? Make us some tea, please. - And coffee for me. - All right. Nice legs. So slender. And athletic calves. - Alexander Egorovich... - Yes? This morning I saw that Timofeev's neck was injured. A longish cyanotic bruise. As if from a tight nooze. In his history case I found your notes dated one year ago and two years ago. I observed this happen to him several times. A bluish bloodshot scar. How can you account for this? I noticed Timofeev has these marks once a year, on March 3, to be precise. You know what day is that? On March 3, 1881, Grinevitsky, the assassin of Alexander II who died from mortal wounds was beheaded for the townspeople to identify him. For he died without naming himself. - The tea. - Thanks. What is this - self-suggestion? I guess so. Very curious too: in August Timofeev has symptoms of perforated ulcer, which in fact is not the matter with him. And? Jacob Yurovsky, who shot Nicholas II and his family, died of perforated ulcer in August 1938, in Moscow, at Granovsky hospital. So, if this self-suggestion is still so strong, it means he still identifies himself with the tsars' assassins? - And he tries to conceal this. - Yes. So he lies when he says that now it's all gone. Maybe. You know very well schizo cases are very cunning and crafty. ...At dinner, Nicholas II would start his repast with a glassful of vodka bidding other guests to follow his example. The emperor would sit at the middle of the table, with his back to the door. The empress would sit to the left of her husband. The little Alexey would constantly frolic. After dessert they would serve coffee with cream. During coffee the emperor would raise his voice saying: 'Gentlemen! You may smoke.' He would draw on the first cigarette hungrily, which he would put out, half of it unsmoked. After the first cigarette he would light himself the second one, which he would smoke to the end. This manner of smoking showed the tsar's agitation. After that, at the table, the general silence would fall. The emperor then would proceed to the hall followed by all the rest. Then His Highness would retire to his cabinet, bidding the others, with a bow, to break up. - Good evening. - Hi. Take a seat, Timofeev. I'm all right now. But what happened? It beats me. Maybe turned my neck awkwardly while I slept. Be my guest. Do you have relatives? I've a sister. But she disowned me. But you have brothers too? No, no brothers. But yes: your two brothers live in America. Two brothers are captives in Germany, and another one is a gunsmith in Petrograd... and another one is in Harbin, Doctor, I am not Yurovsky. When I was ill, I thought I was Yurovsky. So, when you were ill, you really thought so? Yes, I thought so. It seemed to me... I had killed the tsar. Killed him personally? Yes. Killed Nicholas II and his son. I seemed to me I did this. nd that, like Yurovsky, you had children? Yes, it seemed to me I had three children. The girl Eve told you this? Yes, she told me so.... ...that I have sons Alexander and Zhenya, and the elder daughter Rimma. That Rimma... was she a revolutionary too? Yes, she was a revolutionary, a partisan. She fought Kolchak. That's what I wrote to comrade Stalin. - To whom? - To comrade Stalin. I wrote to him they had arrested Rimma by mistake. Enemy infiltrated the Cheka. I'm a honest communist. I was loyal to the Party and so I will, till the end of my days. My daughter can't be an enemy of the people. And what was Stalin's answer? He hasn't answered me yet. I gave the letter to my wife only yesterday. My tests are satisfactory. My urine specimen and my stool specimen. I will recover. When you discharge me, I'll go to comrade Stalin. Yakov Mikhailovich! You have strong stomach ache, don't you. - - Yes? Yes, Yes, it hurts badly. It hurts day and night. There is one thing which beats me: where this girl disappeared? Which girl? Eve? No. Not Eve. Alexandra Galeeva. On July 16 she went to church and never came back. We didn't kill her. Believe me, we didn't kill her. Where could she go? Doctor, please! Doctor, please! Help me... How are you? Timofeev? Professor! Professor! Let me see my wife. It's very important. You set this off: now again he's Yurovsky dying at Granovsky hospital from perforated ulcer. I didn't think the reaction would be this strong. Though, I did want to provoke his paranoia. How is that girl of yours? I don't know. Haven't seen her. She has gorgeous legs. Never saw anything like that. Maybe we should try and heal Timofeev? To heal? Him? But how? He is easily suggestible. The focal point in his delirium is Nicholas II, the moment of his shooting. Say someone passes himself off as Nicholas II, then he blows his legend - thus leaving for Timofeev no delusion of his victim. Where there is no victim - there is no assassin. Alexey Mikhailovich, why do you need all this? Why do we think that schizo patients are less happy than the so-called normal people? And what is a normal person? A dumb guy, with no imagination. He's nothing else. You can't imagine yourself as Caligula or Napoleon, or Shakespeare, or Dostoevsky, or Jesus Christ, or Muhammad. It isn't any worse than living a life of a Stepan Petrovich or Petr Stepanovich drudging away all his life. I'm leaving to Kursk. I'll be back on Monday. April 30, 1918, new style: I remember it very well... I rode to a photo parlour which I owned back then in Ekaterinburg. It was an officer and a pretty lady in a lilac dress. - Would you like to be photographed? - Yes. They wanted to be photographed. The photographer was ill, so I took the errand. Attention please! Congratulations. Your fiancee is very beautiful. Alas, we'll have to separate, maybe for a long time. You serve in the Headquarters Academy? Yes. The situation in town is unrestful. So, Katya had better go to Petrograd. Or even go abroad - to France or America. To America? I was in America. My 2 brothers live there. Well, Russia is going down the drain. A man can be a warrior. But a pretty woman... Thank you. I'll drop by tomorrow, in the afternoon. They were a very handsome couple, especially the girl. I never saw them again. Lock the door and don't receive anybody. I'll be away for several days. Yakov Mikhailovich! What else happened on that day? Do you remember? Of course I do. I went to the railway station. I worked for Cheka: they had to bring the tsar and tsarina from Tobolsk. And then you saw Nicholas II for the first time? No, they had been taken off the train at a goods yard - lest some stir be caused. But I was late there too. They had been taken away already. So, I went to Ipatiev's house, in Ascension Street. The Urals Council decided to accommodate them there. When I arrived there, they had been taken in already. So I went to American Hotel, that is the Regional Cheka. We interrogated people that came with the Romanov family. Some of them we released. Count Dolgoruky and some other man we shot at the old cemetery. So, you didn't see me, on that day? See you? You were you in Ekaterinburg too? Lesha! Lesha! What happened? The blood? Lesha? Why the blood? - I'll call the ambulance. - No! Timofeev? - What about the doctor? - He has fallen ill. Timofeev! Yes? Nevermind. You may go. I awoke at night from acute pain. Somewhere here I saw a scar. It was bleeding. Not profusely, but it was. Though - no open wound. It was a scar about 8 cm long and within 1 cm thick. As if from a wound inflicted by a sharp long object. The wound seemed to have scarred many years ago. Maybe it was a delusion? It was night time. You could have scratched your head - hence the blood. You were scared and took a scratch for a scar. Alexander Egorovich! I lived with this scar during 24 hours. And only today, at 10 a.m., the scar vanished. So you've started working with Timofeev? Alexander Egorovich, excuse me... I want to ask you a doctor-to-doctor question. Timofeev's case is something out of the ordinary. Why you, a professional psychiatrist - during all these years - why didn't you take care it? Why do you think I didn't take care of it? You know, in 1891 Alexander III sent his elder son on a world tour. So they embarked, a merry boisterous company. Among them the Greek royal heir, the Romanian king's son and so on. During the trip the young men were merry-making. Once, Nicholas urinated onto a Shinto shrine. And a policeman struck him on the head with his saber. Luckily, the Greek scion eased the blow with his cane. And? Nevertheless, Nicholas was wounded: and all his life, on the right side of his head he wore a scar. You see, Alexei Mikhailovich... In this sphere which we make our profession, in the sphere of human consciousness, there are things beyond our understanding. Beyond our understanding - ever. But, first of all, we should not aspire to this understanding. Alexander Egorovich! Hi, Timofeev. - How are you? - I'm nice. Very nice. - How do you feel? - I am all right. Timofeev. Did you see again that girl Eve? Eve? No, I stopped seeing it, since long time ago. - So, you are all right? - Yes. What do you think of your new doctor? I like him. He's a nice doctor. Only his health is poor. Do you talk, the two of you? Yes. He keeps asking me questions. About my delusion of being the tsar's assassin. You told him how you shot the tsar? Not yet. Your cheeks pink with color. No big surprise - fresh air. Maybe I should transfer you to Yaroslavl? You'll have more freedom there... a nice park. So, what would you say? No, I'm fine here. Good doctors, good care, good catering. You're a funny guy. Oh, come on. Well, take care. Thanks, Alexander Egorovich! See you! See you. My hometown is Tomsk, the outskirts of Russia. My father's name was Heim Yurovsky. He had seven children. I was born in 1883. I was in for an awful lot. To be born into the family of a junkman, at the back doors of the empire - it sucks. When I was 16 I left for America. To start everything from scratch. To make a U-turn in my life. I even converted into Lutheranism. Once I read in a brochure how a Pole, Grinevitsky, killed the tsar Alexander. That was quite a shock! How could he raise his hand against the Lord's way of things, against the chosen one - a tsar! But - nevertheless... Thus I concluded there is no God existing. Neither Christ, nor Yahweh or Muhammad... There is only the human will and its sway over everything. And I decided to be like that Pole. Only I didn't want to die like him. I wanted to live, to drink good wine. I wanted to be loved by women, and my body to be spared from cold. All my life I found poor undergarments repulsive. It was inherent in me. I returned to Russia. Lent some money from my father. Got married and opened a photo parlor in Ekaterinburg. Life seemed to be smooth for ever and ever. What day is it today? It depends - what style. I got mixed up. It's June 30. - Why so? - I think it's June 30. No, by no means. Jesus! Does anyone here know what day it is today? It's unbearable. Can anyone tell me what day is today? Alex! Alex, please. Leave me alone. I spent my best years on you. And look - what it all came to. I know, it's all because of your mother! Yes, your mother! She always hated me. Mother, I know exactly what day it is today. July 16, 1918, Lenin's style. 'According to the provision committee, 'the population of Ekaterinburg, as of July 1, 'is numbered: 80.870 people, '2502 horses, '3267 cows, 1207 pigs and goats.' How many horses? 2502 horses. 'An English lady - lessons of English... '...revolutionary tribunal's hearing of the case 're the priest Zhitov: illegal drinking.' They shot him? He was fined - 300 rubles. Priests are awful drunkards. What about the theatre? Well... In 'Lorange'- 'People are Slaves, only the Sea is Free'. A drama in four acts. In Arts Theatre - A Victim of Science 'and of a Wicked Professor.' The Circus: women's wrestling. Indeed. The Ascension Church: it's nearby? Right across the street. 'An 8-year-old girl missing... 'Alexandra Galeeva... 'Went to the Ascension Church and never came back.' - Where did she vanish to? - I don't know. Nothing is said about it. Good morning. They sent you fresh eggs from the monastery. Thank you! By the way, do you know how much the eggs are nowadays? 30 rubles per a hundred. Meat - 5 rubles per a pound. But of very mediocre quality. The prices are awful! 'Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, 'and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ' you have built houses of hewn stone, ' but ye shall not dwell in them; 'ye have planted pleasant vineyards, 'but ye shall not drink wine of them. 'For I know your manifold transgressions 'and your mighty sins: 'they afflict the just, they take a bribe, 'and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right. 'Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time... 'For that time is full of malice. 'Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: 'and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you, 'as ye have spoken. "Hate the evil, and love the good." 'Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! 'to what end is it for you? 'the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light...' You! What were you thinking? Me? Yes - when they were taking you to Ekaterinburg? No! I didn't want to go there. When I learnt they were taking us to Ekaterinburg, I knew it was the end. I didn't want to. When I was 13, socialists killed my grandfather. He was still alive when I was brought to his bedside. He was lying there... his legs were covered with a sheet which was all soaked with blood. My father told me: 'Come! 'Say farewell to your grandfather.' But I couldn't even budge. It wasn't fear or because of the blood. I just felt at that very moment: that unequivocally, fatefully, I would be killed. And that my death would be many times more horrible compared to my grandfather's death. Later, my father, exceedingly drunken, came to my room. He patted me on my head and said: 'Well, Nicky, now you are a successor.' I said: 'Father, I don't want to be a successor.' But my words went wide. He was dead asleep in an armchair. And truly so, I didn't want to be a smb which my origin had made me. I didn't want to be popularly hated, to be hunted upon, as if I were some game. Like it happened to my grandfather and my father... I didn't want my would-be son to be as lonely as myself. No! I didn't want anything of the kind. Alexey Mikhailovich! - Hi. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Thank you. You look bad. Hey, forget about Timofeev. Why do you need him? I want to understand why he was that very person to have killed me. ...I saw I would be the person to kill you. I had the word you were coming to Ekaterinburg, and I decided... or I rather felt... ...that I would have to do this. By killing you I would stop being a non-entity and start being a person whose name would be imprinted in history... Then I saw you - and I got scared. I felt frightened Because you were not the way I had imagined you. Not someone upon whom I wanted to pour all my spite and hatred. You were exhausted with the grave illness of your son... Your girls - more like daughters of a merchant: the doctor, the ladies in waiting, the cook - inadvertent members of the historical drama. All this didn't jibe with a guillotine, a scaffold covered with crimson silk, with the drumming and the words of sentence... It was weird, it was all false! Also, the events around you were complete rigmarole. Everyone knew you were doomed, but mum was the word. Everyone wanted to get rid of you. You were a source of too many problems. Everyone wanted to get rid of you: Bolsheviks, S.R's, anarchists, Germans, Englishmen... ...No one cared for the alive you. The dead you - it was more expedient. The Central Committee decided that you should... vanish. Which was to happen in Ekaterinburg. And you? You - have you ever been in Sverdlovsk? I wonder what it is like nowadays. Citizen Romanov, you should proceed into the house. On this site the Ipatiev house was situated: on April 30, 1918 Nicholas II was brought here, with his wife and with his daughter Maria. The successor to the throne Alexey had congenital haemophilia. He had injured his leg, he was brought here from Tobolsk only a month later, alongside with his sisters Olga, Tatiana, Anastasia. Together with the Romanovs there were Dr. Botkin, the cook Kharitonov, the valet Trupp, the maid Demidova and the boy Sidnev - Alexey's servant. The Soviet officials thought Ekaterinburg was hinterland. But by early July it turned into the frontline. When, in 1938, I was dying at Granovsky hospital, I recollected that day. It was not that I was afraid of my recollections, nor I had pangs of conscience or was haunted by nightmares. None of this 'bloodstained boys' stuff. Nothing of the kind. I wasn't thinking about you. I knew I was dying. But I was dying being the same as when I was born. A sheer commonplace. And I wondered - why? Why it happened so? What was my mistake? Go away! It's restricted area here. What's the matter? This woman is looking for her daughter. She went to the Ascension Church and disappeared. So now she's looking for her. Mister! Have you seen my child? Light hair, blue eyes. Her name is Alexandra Galeeva. I don't know about no girl. Go away. You can't stay here. Call Medvedev for me. Medvedev, collect 10 pistols, go to the forest and try them out. Here, take mine too. Why are you looking at me so? The nuns were here. They brought fresh eggs for them. Bring Magyar guys here. We need the furniture taken out from the basement. Hey, Pavel. There is a woman looking for her daughter. I know. She was here yesterday too. Where could she disappear? Could you guys by any chance...? Why on earth should we need this? Such a weird story. Good morning. They sent you fresh eggs from the monastery... So, when you brought eggs, you knew you were going to kill us that very day. An enciphered wire signed by Sverdlov came via Perm on July 16, at 10 a.m. What did Anastasia tell you? In the yard... Do you remember? What she told me...? Nothing particularly. She asked about the Chita town and its whereabouts.. How did she die? On the spot? She was wounded. And was finished off with bayonets. In 1921 I met Lenin. In my report I offered to use the Romanov jewelry for buying grain from abroad. Lenin liked the idea. He went into the details. We were talking for about 10 minutes. I expected him to ask me the main question. Of course he knew I was the one who had killed you. I knew he was the man who had made the decision. We had done it together. Me and him. I waited for a hint, for a slightest allusion. But - no. He appointed me Director of the Diamond Depository. It's the Czechs shooting. Why did you come? Voikov! - Is it for pleasure-shooting? - Yakov. Stop talking nonsense. I prepared a speech. What speech? - What speech? - Just a speech. A verdict on behalf of the Revolution. Have you brought kerosene? Look, Yakov: you turn the greatest historical act... into a banal, routine event. I'm lost for words. Never mind the words. I give you the revolver: either you shoot - or you go away. You behave as if it concerns only you, as if we don't count. Take the revolver! And you will count I wonder, what they are doing right now. You may go and take a look. You know, Yakov: that boy, Sednev, Alexey's servant. We need to take him away. Medvedev! Go and take Sednev away. - They may get alarmed. - Tell them his uncle wants to see him. - The uncle has been shot. - They have no idea. Good bye then. Sednev. Come with me. - Where are you taking him? - To his uncle. What about the boy? Has he survived? I don't know. They took the boy to his home village... Tula region, it seems. - What are they doing? - They're asleep. I wasn't asleep, though. I knew, that night... everything will be over. I knew it when you were looking at me from the window. I didn't fear death. It was strange I lived till as old as 50. But I also knew, when you took the boy away, I knew that you will kill not only myself, you will kill everybody. I was lying and thinking: after all, maybe Russia will be better off if you kill all of us?.. Rise everybody. We should take them to the basement. What's the matter? Anarchists can attack the house any time now. I understand. Will you be so kind... Good morning. Please follow me. No chairs? Can't we even sit down? Bring in 2 chairs. Now it's time. Istvan and me, we can't shoot ladies. Nikulin. And you. Come here. Take their revolvers. Get ready. Aim for the heart. - Line up! - Where? Here. All of you. Bearing in mind your relatives in Europe keep confronting the Soviet Russia... - ...you're sentenced to death. - What, what?.. ...At about 3 in the morning we started off. 5 versts away from Verkhnesetsk factory your bodies were undressed and dumped into an empty mine shaft. But it wasn't deep enough... I found another shaft: at the 9th verst along the Moskovsky road. The next night we hauled you out, loaded you into the trucks and started off again. At about 4 a.m., July 19, the car got stuck completely. So we were left to bury you or to burn you down - which one comrade promised to do - I forgot his name. But that guy went away, breaking his promise. We meant to burn down Alexey and Alexandra, but instead of the Empress we burnt down the duchess. Then we made a common grave and put all of you therein. Your faces we disfigured with the butts of our rifles and acid. The ditch was covered with earth, dead branches, on top of it - 2 sleepers. The car rolled thereon several times... The secret was safely kept. The White Russians didn't find your burial place. - What happened? - A guest died last night here. Wait here. It's a swastika. Swastika is an ancient symbol of Hindus. It stands for prosperity and good fortune. The empress must have inscribed it. Alexandra, she seemed to be a big lover of all kinds of magical signs. And over Alexey's bed - there is another swastika. What are you doing here? I felt like drawn towards this place. Was it you who wrote those lines in the basement? It's a Heine! "In that night was Belshazzar slain by his own servants." The poetical transcription is very beautiful too. "Before died out the blinking star, the slaves came in - and slew the tsar!" Can you imagine this! A son of a junkman to have finished off the most powerful dynasty in the world. I was only a conductor of the Revolution. Oh yes. It turned out to be horribly simple - how to remain in the world history. This I couldn't even imagine. And the world will never know what we did to them... ...I lived another 20 years and died of perforated ulcer, in August 1938, in Moscow, Granovsky hospital. What happened to her? Where did she disappear, that girl? Yakov Mikhailovich! That girl... I didn't... kill her... What did you say? That girl! Where did she... disappear?
