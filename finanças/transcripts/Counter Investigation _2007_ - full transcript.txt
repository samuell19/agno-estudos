Good morning, Arnalde. Sir. Hi, Josse. Results of the autopsy? Raped and beaten to death with a stone. Do we have anything? DNA? Negative. There are traces of lubricant. From the condoms. Have we interrogated the boy? He was with her, but after an argument, she left. He went to a friend. We checked. How many men do we have down there? 2 groups. 20 guys. Is that enough? Put 10 more cops onto it. I want this bastard! Slow music ... Can we cover the casket? ... Forgive me, my love. Forgive me. Sleep, baby. Sobs ... Police Sirens ... The Police have arrested a suspect ... ... In the murder of little Emily Malinowski. About 30 years old, the man is being questioned by the crime squad. His identity, for now, has not been divulged. So, has he confessed? No. He continues to deny it. He says he was there, but is not involved. And the forensic identification? Complete unknown. We sent his fingerprints for analysis. Waiting for the results. Without DNA we need a confession. Leave me alone with him and you'll have it. Come on! He'd claim that the confession was illegally obtained. We have to do this right. Am I making myself clear? Stop it, Richard! Let me go! Who let him in? Calm down! Let me go! Calm down! I'll take him home. I want him to stay there until the other is brought to justice.

And, to corroborate our doubts regarding the validity ... ... of these confessions ... ... and of the entire process ... ... I will submit for your consideration ... ... the fact that, despite forensic science being to the fore, .. ... the police have been unable ... ... to provide irrefutable evidence. I refer, of course, to DNA evidence. I will speak of the unseemly haste with which the investigation was conducted ... ... the lack of formal evidence, ... ... all these details which have escaped ... ... the wisdom of the investigators. Finally, I will speak of these investigators .. ... who are the very colleagues of the father of the victim. Hubbub ... Silence in court!

To the question, 'Is the accused guilty of the murder of Emily Malinowski?', ... ... the answer was 'yes' by a majority of at least 8 votes.

I am innocent. Don't misinterpret the purpose of this letter. I'm not asking for a review of my case. Justice has spoken and I suppose that the despairing father must be satisfied. But is the policeman satisfied? Here, in this hole, I am powerless to change my situation. What interest would I have in claiming that I am innocent? Ask yourself, could justice have made a mistake? Could you live with the knowledge that the culprit lurks nearby ... ... and may offend again? I beg you to believe in my compassion. Daniel Eckmann." Radio noise One year later Police Radio It's opening. Richard, do you copy? Copy that. It's the garbos. Considered a mentally retarded pervert by the psychiatric experts who examined him ... Armand Salinas committed his first child murder before he was 20. He crossed all of France, travelling on foot or by train, staying in shelters for the homeless. It's him. Since his arrest ... ... by the Bordeaux Criminal Investigation Department ... ... he has become the record holder of unsolved crimes. The young victims, ... ... both boys and girls, were selected randomly. The discovery of the body, which may be that ... ... of Loïc Fuller, who disappeared in 2004, ... ... would lengthen the list of his crimes. I didn't do anything! What the hell were you doing? A love letter. Thanks. Aren't you going to read it? Not right now. Room inspection. Among the women who write to you, there are mothers of families. That burns my ass! Life is unfair. You need a pretty face to attract sympathy. Even if you're a complete asshole. Because you know you're an asshole. Can I take a piss? Did you hear the news about Salinas? Regarding the boy who disappeared near Bordeaux last summer. Yes, I am aware of it. I'd like to go and check something out. Regarding Salinas? We're not handling the case. I know. I just want to check something. Damn! Tell me ... ... what kind of check? A feeling, that's all. A feeling? I can go while I am on holiday. Is it my style to get in the way of an investigation? If you want, you can go. But sometimes, don't forget that I am your boss. I'll call you when I get there. Say hello to Stephen from me. Everything is there. Salinas, Albin Migie .. ... Loïc Fuller. There you go. Ok You have on paper a comparitive analysis ... ... of other cases in which he is suspected. It will take you a year or two to digest all this. Knock, knock, knock I can't stay with you. If you need me, you can reach me on the mobile. The coffee machine is there. You'll need it. Take him into custody, advise the prosecutor and check his identity. We'll deal with the rest tomorrow. Aren't you tired of chasing after thugs? Send the young guys after them. The young guys are thinking of their careers. Only the old guys like me are still playing cowboys and Indians. Did you find anything interesting? Yeah. Must see it at my leisure. We are going over to my place for dinner. I won't be good company. You think I'm going to leave you here while I get a steak? Mathilde is waiting for us. Your room is ready. What do you think? He told me he had a little fixer-upper! You had girls? You're stupid! You should have seen the state when we arrived! Here you go. Is it for me? Yes. Thank you, Gabriel. It's beautiful! Are they birds? No, they're angels and there, that's Emily. We'll get your schoolbag or you'll be late for school. Goodbye, Richard. Study hard. Sorry. We never discussed it in front of him. It doesn't matter. That's children for you. I just learned that the court of appeal has reconfirmed your sentence. I'm incredibly sad but not surprised. It is rare that the justice of men acknowledge its errors. You must be very disappointed and dejected. But continue the fight. You're not alone. Continue to write to me. I shall try to put as much hope in my letters as you put in yours. It's thanks to the confession of Salinas, that we found the body of Loic Fuller. He had disappeared from a campsite where he was on holiday with his parents. Salinas sometimes mixes the elements of different murders. For Loïc Fuller, he talks about biking and a pond. The boy was found in a field and he was on foot when he disappeared. This murder and the other 3 have similarities .. ... with that of Emily. What re you trying to tell me? Here's the best for last. A cousin of Salinas lives 15 km from where Emily was killed. Barking ... Sarko, heel! Don't move. Inspector Malinowski. I called you yesterday Ah ... This way. They say Armand is a monster. He's a poor devil. Thanks. When he was a kid, his father beat him ... ... With cables, fed him dog food. When his mother died, he was so unhappy. When the coffin was lowered into the ground ... ... He jumped into the hole in despair. Have you considered .. ... whether your cousin was there in June 2003? On the phone I didn't remember. But afterwards, I was reminded of something. He was there, I mean, during the case. We discussed it together. He had found work as a laborer for the town. One evening, I called the doctor for his migraines. I always keep the prescriptions. There. the 22nd, that's it. Excuse me, ... ... your daughter, when did this happen? The day before. The judge must interview Salinas again. You know what she told you is worthless. She needs to be formally interviewed. I know. I know. That's why someone has to go. There is also Salinas' employer to be interviewed. I want you to take care of it. You're kidding! I'm overwhelmed here! Listen, Stephen, I feel something. I am not wrong about this. I'm sure. Fine, I'll call Arcaro tomorrow and I'll go day after tomorrow. All right? Yes, that's fine. We can't drag the chain. I'll call you as soon as I've got it. Thanks. The blood is a little dark. Claire! Wait ... What's the blood oxygen level? Damn! Your blood oxygen level is 55! What is it? It was not in the trachea. Here is a picture of me like you wanted. Don't show anyone. I would be embarrassed if anyone saw it. Sir, this is my fourth letter ..." ... and still you have not replied." Perhaps you have decided to ignore my correspondence?" I respect that choice, but that will not stop me from writing again.

This way, Inspector. Come on up. Excuse me. I am taking advantage of retirement to keep myself in shape. I'll be right with you. You're welcome. Beep beep beep Good, that will do for today. My wife bought it for herself ... ... but considering what it cost, ... I decided ... to take advantage of it a little. You have the prescription? As I said on the phone, it's not recent. Armand Salinas ... I remember. His cousin called me. He had headaches and was delirious. I had to administer a sedative. What was the reason for this crisis? He had had problems since the death of his mother when he was 15. For him it was a terrible shock. He developed repeated migraines. But at 18, he left home. I never saw him again. You know what became of him? No. Later, I heard stories of physical abuse. People talk too late. And that famous night ... Did you notice anything special? Did he look like he had been in a fight? No, I do not remember. I would have noted it on the prescription. You did not appear at his trial? No, I can't see why I would have appeared. Did you see him again? Never. I heard about him on the news. It was a shock, but ... Yes? I remember the death of your child. Like everyone, I followed the case in the newspapers. If I understand correctly ... ... you think Armand Salinas could be the murderer? It is a possibility. Well ... So, let me tell you something, Captain. I should not tell you this, ... ... because it is covered by medical confidentiality. I don't understand. You think Daniel Eckmann is innocent? I state nothing. I am exploring a trail, that's all. My position doesn't give me unlimited resources. I need a helping hand. Okay. But you will need to tell me more, Inspector. I have plenty of time. Before turning to sports, there are new developments in the Eckmann case. With us, Charlene Kraus, our forensic specialist. Exactly, Antoine. The information comes directly from Inspector Malinowski ... ... The father of little Emily. He determined that the serial killer Armand Salinas, currently incarcerated in Bordeaux, ... ... Indicted for four other murders of children ... ... Was in the Paris region, .. ... The day of the murder of his daughter. We have tried to contact Florence Arcaro, the judge handling the matter, .. ... But she did not want to comment on the case. However, if this information is confirmed, it could lead to a review of the facts ... ... on which Daniel Eckmann was convicted. If I understand correctly, this policemen is launching an appeal for witnesses? Absolutely, Antoine. And having spoken to him at length, ... I can tell you that the Inspector will take this counter-investigation all the way. Even though it may call into question .. ... the findings of his very own colleagues. Thank you. ... What is this story? Who is this Salinas? A serial killer who got nicked in Bordeaux. Stepehen is working on it. What was his relationship with Emily? He was in the area on that day. Why didn't you tell me about it? Why am I learning about it on TV? Trust me. Trust? You re-open the investigation into teh death of your daughter without telling me. You go and confide in a journalist. Do you trust me? Hi. Hi. I sent you a report. Ok. Have you lost your marbles? I want to know who killed my daughter. The person who kileld your daughter is in the can. He's called Daniel Eckmann. If you had listened you'd know that there are some disturbing facts. What I would call coincidences. The case against Eckmann is straightforward. And let me remind you that he confessed. And let me also point out, that Salinas does not rape his victims. As far as we know. Tell me, as of today, can you swear that Eckmann is guilty? One hundred percent? Yes, I can swear to that. I'll sign whatever you want. Believe me, damn it! You're making a mistake looking for someone else. You're hurting and you're hurting people around you, ... ... Starting with Claire. Phone Yes? No, it Arnalds. He is with me. I note. Yes. A good woman called the General Staff. She has things to say about Salinas. I'm coming with you. I saw the report about the case on TV ... ... about your little girl ... ... and Salinas. At the time, .. ... it was a couple of joggers who discovered the body, right? It was June 21, 2003, right? Yes. I'm a maniac. I make a note of everything. My professional appointments and everything I do. Restaurants, cinemas, sports ... Everything. That day, I was also jogging in the woods ... Between 11 and mid-day. I saw Armand Salinas at the end of the path that leads to the pond. I remember his face. You realize what you are saying? Yes. Why did you wait so long before telling us? At the time, they had arrested the culprit. Why would I make a link between the crime and this man that I had seen? I saw the face of Salinas the other evening on TV. This is very important. You must be sure of yourself. If you confirm that you saw Salinas it will have repercussions. For him and for man who is currently incarcerated. I know. But I have to do it, right? Yes. Christina Carlier 34, secretary in an IT company Husband died of cancer 3 years ago. Since then, she lives alone with her son. No police record. A model citizen. A false witness put up by Eckmann? I thought of that. I checked everything. Mail, visits: there's no link. What? What's ip? I don't know. It doesn't feel right. You've heard Her testimony and my information, ... ... That should be enough. Enough for what? Enough for a retrial. A retrial? Are you nuts!? What do you mean, nuts? Everything I have collected points to Salinas! Even the way Emily was killed. Just like the other kids. That's what you say! It remains to be seen. What more do you want? I'll tell you what I want. I want a cop who stops thinking that his colleagues ... Are morons who collared the first person they found. They can all swear that Eckmann is guilty. All of them! Get that through your skull! And stop boozing, for Chrissakes! Eckmann, justice has probably erred in finding you guilty. I have long been on the side of those who believe you to be guilty. But my investigation appears to show that you are not the murderer of my daughter. I didn't want to help you. Only the search for the truth matters to me. Buzzer Dear Richard, I met today with Peters ... ... The lawyer that you found me. He is great. We talked at length about the file that you gave him. It's me. There is a bill that I need to deal with today. I'm running out of checks. Call me back, please. Locked drawer Yes, I'll be there in one hour. Bye, Mum. Hi. I didn't want to get involved.

I want the real culprit, that's all. Which culprit? Arnalds came to see me. He does not understand what is going on with you. Nobody understands what is going on with you. Talk to me! Talk to me! Claire ... Yeah, Gino? What for? Dope. How much? Bugger all, 200 grams. 200 Grams, bugger all!? Take care of it yourself. Shall we go? Are you coming? I can't, Dad. Why not? "You know very well.

I was in the woods, that day. I already told the judge. For the rest, it was not me. The witness said she saw you that day near the pond. It was not me. Either the lady is mistaken, or it was another day. I don't know. Another day. Does that imply that you were a regular visitor to these woods? Not often, but I like to walk. Can we assume that you were In these woods the day of the murder ... ... And that you are confusing it with another day? No, I know very well what I have done and when I have done it. Just because I have screwed up,doesn't mean that you can pin everything on me. Screwed up? Doubtless you mean the four murders to which you have confessed? Counsellor, may I remind you that Mr. Salinas ... .. appears of his own free will. He may only be examined in respect of this case. Limit your comments strictly to this trial. Excuse me, your Honor.

Now I'll tell you how it happened. Lock Are you ready? I'm ready. Sir, you're on. Hi, good evening. First I would like to say that it is fortunate that the death penalty has been abolished in France. Otherwise, Mr. Eckmann would almost certainly have been executed. Then I would like to ask of Mr. Eckmann, how did he react when he was the victim of such a serious miscarriage of justice? I think I reacted pretty well, pretty positively. Those who condemned me did not have all the facts. Then I was pardonned. You know, I believe in God. It helps. There you go. Thank you and goodbye. Before taking a new caller, ... .. I would like to spend a couple of seconds on the man, thanks to whom you have been released, Inspector Malinowski. You have said that you would like to thank Inspector Malinowski. Yes, it's true. I owe my release to him.

What are you going to do with them? I have to burn them. What? Of course, it is safer. But, these letters are important to me. This is our story. They always remind me of prison. And our story. as you call it, it starts now. Come on, give them to me. Is this all of them? Yes. This is very important to me. You know, it's thanks to you that I endured it. Are you sure that nobody knows about the two of us? -Nobody. You don't brag about a relationship with a convict. What's up? Nothing. I think back to what I said in court. I know that you are innocent but it was wrong of me to lie. Christina, listen to me, ... ... You heard the officer testify for me, the father of the little girl? Do you think that he would have done that, if he wasn't sure that Salinas was guilty? You didn't lie. You just allowed the truth to be established ... ... and that truth is that the man, who you love and who loves you, is innocent. When I saw you in court it was crazy. You were exactly as I had imagined you. I wear it all the time. C'mon, now. You should get going. I'll call you soon. Dials mobile phone Counsellor? Good evening it's Daniel Eckmann. I would like to thank Malinowski before I leave ... ... and you said you would give me his number. Yes, go ahead. Yes. Ok, thank you. You can count on me. You gave me nothing. Sure. Good night, Counsellor. Good night. Phone rings Yes? Richard, it's Daniel Eckmann. Yes? You are not surprised? I knew you would call. I am leaving Paris the day after tomorrow. I would love to see you. I need to see you. Good evening. Good evening. This is stupid, I don't know what to say to you. In fact, I wanted to thank you before I left ... ... and also, to give you this. Since the first day of my incarceration, I prayed to God ... ... that he gives me the strength to endure ... ... and that he does something to get me out of there. Do you believe in God, Inspector? I've stopped. It was not mutual. I would like you to keep it anyway. It's important for me. Whisky? That's all I've got. Whisky. Her bedroom is upstairs? Yes. I would like very much to take a few moments to pray for her. I would not be upset if you refused. I would understand completely. Come. Your wife is not here? No. She's gone. It's not for good, I hope. She's a medic, right? Anesthesiologist. Right from the start, I knew it was you. It's one thing to want to kill someone in the heat of the moment ... ... when you are in pain. Afterwards, it's not the same. Over time, .. .. We forget, so as not to go crazy. Sometimes, even, we forgive. 15 years of police work. I've seen broken families, .. Fathers swear they would wait 20 years ... ... But they would kill the murderer of their child or wife. It never happens. Salinas was a unique opportunity. But he has nothing to do with this. He has an extremely rare condition. Someone with this condition is unable to have sex. I don't know why he didn't tell the judge. Perhaps he didn't want to roll over all the time. Maybe he got a kick out of it. Told himself that by shutting his mouth, he would save your hide. Muffled shouts You should never have written to me. Muffled cries There is still no news of Daniel Eckmann. His employer, who was expecting him yesterday, is worried. We managed to contact his lawyer, Mr. Peters. Mr. Eckmann's car was found locked at Orly airport. Could we assume that he wanted to disappear, tired from the pressure? Listen, to tell you the truth ... ... I have heard nothing from him. When you think about everything that he has lived through since his incarceration, .. I wouldn't be surprised that he might have cracked ... ... and that he might have wanted to escape all of the media attention. He needs time to recover ... Time to enjoy the freedom, of which he was unjustly deprived. I am sure that, in a while, he will resurface. Thank you, Counsellor. That is the end of the news. Thank you for watching. I found your letter of resignation. Before his disappearance, Eckmann called you. We have the telephone records. He wanted to thank me. That's it, right. I received a phone call from a retired doctor: Delmas. He wanted to talk to you. He told me something about Salinas, ... ... A genetic abnormality that he suffered from. Apparently he had told you. If he says so ... Bloody hell, do you think that you will live better after this? Live? I died three years ago.
