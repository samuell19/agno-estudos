THE WITCH RETURNS TO LIFE We shouldn't defy fate. This place is evil. But we are working for the government. The doctor over there is from the archeological committee. Any idea what that is? - Bourgeois bullshit! - Uhuh. They should believe me when I say this place is cursed. It's hundreds of years old. It's a good thing they had the brains to call for an expert to examine the area. I'm glad that it's you who came. It seems that the summer is passing along quite nicely at the mansion. Oh you mean because Kauko is also here? Well, Mr. Hallberg is also really nice. A typical representative of an old decadent family. But you love everything that's old, don't you? Well you're not that old. Wouldn't that be something, if you had married some dried up old hag! - Doctor! Come here, quick! - Shhhhh! I told you this whole swamp is cursed! Hey, stop that! We have to fill the grave. We cannot let it get out. Don't do it. Only an aspen stake will hold the witch to the ground. Give me the shovel. I'll dig up the body myself. Don't say I didn't warn you. My grandmother told me about her. They buried the witch alive. They rammed the stake through her chest. What did she do to your grandmother? No, that happened hundreds of years ago. And now they're going to set her free from her grave. Isn't that weird. A strong wind like that out of nowhere. A stake made of aspen. That's what they'll need to ram into her chest. Otherwise she'll come back to haunt them. The ancient people knew the truth. You see? She's trying to kill us... The witch. Shut your trap, before you make me cry! Listen to the wind howl. The spirits don't like their slumber to be interrupted. Aagh! She's toying with us now. But when she returns to life, she'll avenge the stake and the swamp. The wind sure stopped suddenly. Right away as we got up from the grave. Let's go back to the house. Thank you, friends! And a little kiss... "You best of all understood me", said someone famous in his time. And once again it's entirely true. For I've hoped for nothing more than someone to come keep me company. Veikko, Veikko... But the old man is fully convinced that the future owner of the mansion shouldn't be a stranger to work. Veikko, we have made a significant find. Oh, aren't you aware that the most significant find walks by your side? Oh do shut up. We found a grave and a body in the swamp. Well isn't that what graves are for? Are you aware that 300 years ago they buried a girl in the swamp? - She was accused of witchcraft. - Yes, I've heard about it. She used to haunt me in my dreams as a boy. The men are panicked because of it. Could you go and take a look at them? Sure why not. Though I'd like to spend more time with the living witches. I won't be paying if it doesn't resemble me. I'm not trying to depict your external features, but your soul. Goddamn! Are you telling me this mess of miscellaneous colors is my soul? You must have heard some evil gossip about me and my family. It seems that as all great artists in the world I also have to die before I get some recognition. Keep on doing what you do now and it won't be long. You won't be able to sell any of your works. Then again, if I were able to sell anything I'd feel as though I had taken a wrong turn. - Great news, Baron! - Well aren't you excited. Imagine! Hannu found a witch! Yes he has. I knew it the first time I gazed upon you. It's horrifying! It has upset the men completely. - Dear God, they found her? - I'm telling you, nothing good can come from this. That's right, it's a witch. It tried to bury the doctors wife in the grave and smashed an axe on my head. - This is madness! - They'll have the mansion cursed! They shouldn't have set her free! I'm telling you, tree stumps flew as the wind blew. Oh if my dead mother was here, she could save us! Back to the swamp... Back to the swamp... Yup, that's what's going on here. Old wives tales. Maybe so, but the people believed that an aspen stake would keep her trapped in the swamp. - But why a witch? - All women are witches. Thanks to the swamp, the corpse is in surprisingly good condition. Even her clothes are there, and on her neck she has a small bag of spells made of leather. And her hair: Long, black. Pitch black hair. We should go get her! Goddamn it! You won't bring a corpse into my house! Are you afraid? We'll just put her in the cellar. I shall paint her portrait as she was when she was alive. You won't have any trouble depicting her soul. A big black spot. - Do you know something? Your son said... - Bah! Old wives tales. I have a bad feeling about this, Hannu. Let it be. This is important For the first time in history we'll have concrete evidence of the witch hunts. Priority 1, all else can wait. - Even your wife? - That's what the witches do. They come between a man and woman. Witches and artists, they're all alike. Do you know something? Please tell me! I've had my share of fooling around with women, but I never had to stake anyone in the swamp because of it. Goodbye. He sure can be rude. Rudeness must always be accompanied by a dirty imagination, my dear Greta. Don't start arguing again, you hear? - Will you come and give me a hand? - Gladly. This is horrifying. Hannu is so delicate. He'll have nightmares again. And how are you doing with a scientist like him? I love him. Don't you forget that. Your husband is driven by his complexes. Don't let him get attached to the witch. But think how cruel people were back then. Oh but we all have a beast inside us. In the depths of our soul, there is a junkyard filled with ghosts and horrors. Dear Kauko, stick to painting souls. Don't philosophise about them. The women are panicked. They're saying she's returning. - Serves you right for scaring them. - I'm not the one scaring them. It's the witch. They're mad I tell you, mad! There they are. They're carrying her here. They will contaminate us all! I'll have to cleanse myself in sauna tonight. The sins won't be cleansed with water, but with blood. Don't talk like that! I'm innocent and sinless, I've gone to church all my life. The witch bag. - Goddamn it! - That's right, women. I wouldn't have believed, an old witch like that. All women are witches. But there's a difference between an old witch and a witch. There sure is. It's a witch! Almost took my life! 300 years ago the Baron of the mansion was a perverted pig like the Baron now. They're all alike. Well what did he do? As a tax, he demanded all the prettiest girls for one night. Only for a one night? It's Satan! Go away Satan! Don't laugh. The ones with nine lives are messengers from hell. One of the young girls, Birgit, didn't submit. So the baron accused her of witchcraft. So Birgit wasn't a witch? Of course she was. How else could she have the strength to resist the Baron? Oh come on, stop being so mushy. You'll make me feel lonely. This is quite interesting. We can reconstruct the whole dress. And I shall depict the face of the witch. Pitch black hair... Makes me hot already. Poor lad. You actually hope that the witch would return to life. Easy for you to say, you have Greta. Are you jealous? - Then again H's a miracle she chose me over you. - Oh get serious. I'd be jealous. The only thing that warms my bed is a hot water bottle. This isn't right. Her face was wider and her hair pitch black. That's the only witch I know; an enchantress. But it's Greta. How can I help that my hands are guided by forces unknown? Don't let it guide you too far. Way to go Doctor, just what we need, a nice little fight. I'll retreat to my lonely bed. Oh please stop fighting. There! The same way I tore off your picture from my heart once. I'm going to be thorough with this case. Don't get too carried away by your witch. For they can be hazardous for you... You know, you should use some red nail polish for your toes sometimes. - That's heinous! - I don't know from where it came to me. There's some dark places in your dried up scientist soul. I shall be with my books. I suppose your off to bed? Thank you for your concern, but I'll stay right here. Accompanied by my own witch. I'll do what I can for the dress. You stay right there, with your own witch. I must know the truth! They know, but are afraid to tell. Even the men, even Henrik is silenced. The women run away. The old legends live and they believe that the witch also lives. Maybe they're right. Even the books remain silent. But I wont back down. I must know the truth! - God, is that the time? - It sure is. Off to bed mister. Or you'll start having nightmares again. The dress is almost finished. There it is. The witch's dress. I'm also almost finished with the portrait. What color do you think her eyes are? Black. Full of fire. Ah ha, I see. For the love of God, brothers, I need a drink! What is it?! Can't a man have a drink without there being an earthquake? Have a seat. For once I want to enjoy life. - I'm glad you're here. - Glad to be here. Please don't go. I'll die if I can't gaze upon you. You can walk me to the post office, But you'd have to choose between me and the next drink. That won't be difficult. Naturally I'll go with the drink. Knight in shining armor. It's quite comfy here. The glasses are too small though. The bottle empties, as you have to tip over constantly. Oh brothers, it's gloomy to be lonely. You see my old man, the Baron has a nasty reputation, and I don't know where he's been. A boy walks down the road, a girl waves from a porch, they both look familiar. The spitting image of the old man. Oh come on, you know that's not true. It seems that the old man has spread his seeds all over the village. Lord knows who might be my sister. I understand you. Even science says... You and your science are a worthless little dot in the universe. And your art. Something that makes a rational man sick. Why thank you. Best recognition I ever had. Oh come on, my head aches as it is. Does this belong to Greta? Fashion sure takes giant leaps. - It's the witch's dress. - Oh you mean our pitch black haired witch? Don't talk to me about women. Makes me sad. By the way, how do you know she's a witch? When I was a kid, they scared me so bad I didn't have the courage to go out and take a piss in the night. But now I'd dig her up from the swamp if I had to. Be careful what you wish for. it's Friday, the day of Venus and there's electricity in the air. That's right. I'll explode if I can't relieve myself. I'd give away the whole mansion if she'd come to life. I told you to be careful. Why are you both so jumpy? You are working too much Hannu, and you neglect Greta. I suppose you'd be more than willing to help? My my, lightning out there and in here. It'll rain soon. We should go and cover the dig site. This'll warm us up briefly. But if the witch will return to life, by all means bring her in. Will you stop worrying and gel yourself a girl? I'd give my soul, if there'd be something real in this dress. Something soft and warm. Thunder at this time of year... It's unnatural! Witchcraft! They should bury her back in the swamp. That's right! We don't need no witches to make our men insane. That's right, women. - What's the matter? I came to see if you need help. - In God's name.. The grave.. I fear I'm losing my mind! Well what is it? A naked girl, where the witch was. Oh dear, you must've been hit by lightning. They were right. We should not have... We can't leave her there. We should not have pulled the stake out! Get a hold of yourself! The girl is in a shock. She must've been hit by lightning. Yes, they will burn as the lightning strikes and thunder roars! Stop it before we both lose our minds. - Did you see that? - Yes. The cellar was struck by lightning... and the witch returned to life. What's happened? She twisted her ankle. Who were they carrying? Greta? No. She was bare naked and had pitch black hair. Pitch black hair... The witch! The witch... So she came after all. A lightning bolt, and the lights went off as we brought her to the house. Oh come on, the lightning hit the transformer. Why are you stumbling in the dark, brothers? At least light a candle. So it's true! My chest hurts. I was lying in a grave... In the mud! The poor girl is still upset. Just my luck. Did you undress her? Give it a rest. For a second I actually thought the witch had risen from the grave. The witch's hair... Oh boy if it's actually true. Careful! She's waking up and will suffer lasting shock if you keep talking like that. Weren't you the one who said she was a witch? Witch! Buried in the swamp... A stake through the chest... She's remembering the past. She's heard the old women's stories like the rest of us. But think about it, if... Yes, what wouldn't be possible in a world like this? You can wear this. I'll give you a better one when my wife returns. Right! A witches clothes to the witch. Be careful what you say! - She ran straight out of the cellar. - And right into the doctors arms. - And naked! - Oh what have we done to deserve this? She'll bring doom over us! That's right, women. Ain't the first time I've seen a naked girl, but this time it was something else. I was afraid I'd lose my mind. That's what you married men are like... The first new girl you don't know makes your head spin. How long were you in the swamp? The swamp... The wolves were howling in the swamp... But the only wolves you'll find nowadays are in politics and business. It was just the wind. What's your name? - Birgit. - Birgit.. But that's a witch's name. - Are you hungry? - Hungry? After a few hundred years of fasting? You're the Baron's son. Do you know me? Where's my leather bag? Didn't I tell you... The witch had a small leather bag at her breast. Old coins, some seeds and a talisman. Such pretty little feet and legs. Not to mention the knees. - Toes painted in red nail polish... - Now now, Hannu. Remember Greta, your wife. These go with the dress. What have we here? The gentlemen are not alone. This is... Well I don't know who, but she was struck by lightning. It seems you were all a bit thunderstruck. Who are you? And why are you wearing the witch's dress? We found her in the swamp grave. She is... sick. But where are her clothes? Lord knows... Or Hannu, he found her. Poor little girl, you need some rest. Some rest? She's been lying in a grave for the past 300 years. It's best if you take her to bed, Greta. Tomorrow we can call a doctor. Oh brothers... Keep your pants on! Can't you see that she's wound up? Well if she's a bit out of her head, maybe she'll even like me. Good morning! I'll lend you this so you don't have to run around dressed as a witch. I remember... Thunder... and the swamp. How did you end up in the swamp? Who are you? - They say I'm a witch! - Calm down, don't be silly. - What's that? - Don't touch! I was impaled with a stake. Good morning, Greta. Did the witch keep you awake last night? She's weird. A minute a ago she... We'll have to call a doctor. But the storm last night broke the telephone. What does Hannu say about this? He stayed up all night with his books. You know I'm a bit worried. Hannu is so delicate, and all this talk about the witch... But she almost made us go mad. You're right. All a wife has to do is turn her back, and there you are fooling around with naked women in the dark. The whole bunch of you. Funny you should say that... Say what? Darling you should've at least tried to sleep a little. I'm sorry, am I disturbing you? Hannu my darling, don't be like that. You're always so grumpy when you've just woken up. I wanted to have a chat with our guest, but she wasn't in her room anymore. What!?!?! Did you go to... The bower? There she goes. Witchcraft! Its leg is broken. Curse you witch! If it's truly broken, the horse must be put down. Peculiar... A hidden lust for killing. Calm down, you know Hannu has always had a hobby in shooting. Unfortunate. But of course it was just an accident. Poor little girl. She had another seizure. Shock treatment could possibly help her. What's that? The witch we found in the swamp. - What the hell...? - Same figure, same hair. I added the eyes this morning. She's hysterical. She thinks she actually is a witch. - I should have known. - Calm down. lt's just a coincidence. You see miss, this whole "witch" thing... Don't offend her. They are stalking me. You're my only friend. Help me! She bit me! So. This is the little horse killer? A sweet little witch, isn't she? - Dad, don't. - Come! We better inform the authorities, or at least call a doctor. She must be Sauna-Maija's lunatic daughter. I sent for her, when I heard people talk. Thank God. That explains a lot. Apparently nothing bad can come of this. - What do you want? - I know how to milk a cow. Blood... Blood! - Are you out of your mind? - She's a witch! Now she's a vanished witch. - She made the cow bleed! - Oh don't be ridiculous. It seems he doesn't understand the situation. We must save the mansion. It baffles me to think how strong superstitions are around here. They can't be removed by schools, compulsory education, radios, libraries... It's like all atavistic senses wake up every time something unusual happens. Is the girl here? People are furious and want to kill her. Dear God. Has everyone gone insane? Where is the poor thing hiding? Blood! Blood of a strongman, blood! Birgit, you mustn't! - I want to help you. - I don't want you. But me, yes? Go back to your Greta, this one's mine. Well look at the men all enchanted by the witch. Hysterical... I almost believe the witch's soul to be transferred into her. So it's her soul you're interested in? And what about you? I know what you're interested in, and it's not the soul. You see, I paint souls but for myself I'm looking for something less... ethereal. - And I suppose Greta is less ethereal? - Hannu stop it, he's just joking. Yes, only joking. And you can joke all you like, for all I care. You stick to your witch. I understand Hannu. He's only interested in her as... A scientist, am I right? Apparently you are happy in your scientifically perfect marriage. You don't need a scientist to know where you're going with that! But wasn't I the one who warned you not to become enchanted by the witch? Please excuse me while I interrupt your scientific conversation. But THIS I will definitely interrupt! It's the baron's turn. Come! Goddamn it, the old man is over 60. Come closer. Everything seems peachy, huh? The boy's head is spinning like a whirligig and all you need is "OK" from pops? Answer me! What do you want? Nothing less than the mansion will do, right? - The mansion? - You are cunning. Do you think that I don't know who you are? You are Sauna-Maija's daughter. Confess! What are you looking at? Are you trying to put a spell on me too? What do you want? Money? Do not torment me. Are you actually trying to get the mansion? Poor little girl. You must be smart enough to understand it's impossible! You must leave here. You don't have a clue what a dangerous game you're playing. I could let the peasants whip you and bury you back in the swamp! And ram a stake through your chest, like my forefather did 300 years ago. The same blood runs in my veins as did in his. When I gaze upon you... You are a damned pretty little witch. I wish I were younger, so I could tame you. You dirty old goat, I'll cut off your horns. Dad, you are called for. I nearly lost my breath hurrying here. With these painful old legs. Good evening, Baron. Good evening. It's a good thing you came, Sauna-Maija. We'll get this thing cleared once and for all. I agree, everything must be cleared up. The girl has a bad personality. I've no idea where that comes from. Probably from lumberjacks and gypsies. Your daughter is there. Take her and leave. She's not my daughter. Not your daughter? Sure isn't. You think I know the people I've made? I was a bit worried, since my daughter was supposed to go work on some steamboat. A slight resemblance yes, looks like an idiot, yes, but not my daughter. - Doesn't she know who she is? - I thought... Your thoughts don't make her mine. I almost had a heart attack when they came and said... Goddamn it! She isn't yours? So get lost, you hear? Oh I wont let you go so easy. I demand compensation! Compensation? For what? Because you scared me half to death and made me run with my old painful legs! I demand compensation, for she's not mine! Get out foul wench, before I lose my temper! Don't you know Baron that the rich shouldn't oppress the poor nowadays? Silence! I see. Well let me tell you why the girl looks like my daughter. And all the other village girls also! Ummm, well... You see I... What you pork in the past will come oinking in the future! But of course I can tell that it was the Baron himself who... Now now... Of course I will pay compensation. Well it's about time, for the old pains still remain unpaid. Now now, go on get out already. Why thank you Baron. Fucking witch! Are you my father's siblings also? Well there you have it. Everything has an explanation. Now we have no use for stakes or madmen's theories. You all hate me. You want to take me back to the swamp! Am I a witch? I remember... I was lying in the swamp... You carried me... And your hand touched my naked breast! She is a witch... And I set the cursed thing free. - Come on Hannu, we'll all go insane. - She is a witch. Look! Kauko! Veikko! - Don't be a fool, I don't care for her. - Who do you care for then, Greta? We must sort this out before we start killing each other. I think she regained her memory when she was scared by the gunshot. Madness seems to be contagious. You're the ones who are insane, you men. And for what? Do you have trouble understanding it Miss Greta? It is true. She's a witch! Maybe... Don't you see? I've been waiting for so long. So preposterously long. I also want to love. I want to embrace a warm young body. In the meadows among the flowers. Naked in the warmth of fire, of blood! I can't let her go out alone. I shall fetch her. Wait! I'll come with you. In that case I'll stay and keep Greta company. Oh... I guess Veikko will manage fine on his own. You men are despicable. We all have a beast inside us. No matter what science says. - There she is! - And she's got the young master under her spell. The men were right. We must do it before it's too late. Birgit! - To the swamp! - The swamp! - The swamp! - Back to the swamp! Did you see Birgit? The people were chasing her. They must've gone to the swamp. She went in. That's right, women. - Escaped to her corpse. - That's what they always do. There she is. - She came from the cellar. - Main thing is she lives. No, don't take me back to the swamp! Don't let them have me! Calm down, no one will hurt you. I'll take you to bed. In my room. Nasty business. The wisest thing would've been to leave her in the swamp. You're getting old, dad. Few years ago youd've never said anything like that. I'd never have touched something like her. She's a witch. I saw her running from the cellar. When I went back there, the corpse was missing. Missing... The soul of the witch has taken a new place to dwell. You're out of your mind. This is getting on all of our nerves. I saw it with my own two eyes. Everyone seems to have gone mad. Even the peasants. I should've shot her. Everything will be cleared up when we bring her to the authorities. Don't touch her! She's... Yours, right? Seems you're a bit jealous. I might be. But can you guess who am I jealous of? Put that thing away! You're acting crazy. Blasted little snake! Mark my words, she's faking it to get her hands on the mansion and you. Sweet little snake... I'd be more than glad to provide for her. Isn't that subject a bit too serious for joking? On the contrary. At a time like this, one must. But not on a subject like this. Don't forget, people have unknown powers within which can be seen, but not comprehended. What's so difficult to comprehend? All women are witches! And there's only one situation where women see themselves equal to men. But don't forget, in modern society men and women are equal. There are no differences between them. But thank God there will always be that one little difference between them. Well scientists have succeeded in artificial fertilization. Lord knows why. The traditional way is much more fun. So that the sterile husband shouldn't be jealous. Stop it! Birgit! Hannu!!! I... I thought the gunshot would... Don't be afraid. I'll do anything for you. That girl has driven us all insane. You've been up all night long studying about witches. No wonder you're upset. I'm tired. I'd better go to sleep if you don't mind. Of course, by all means. - Good night. - I'll come with you. No, you don't have to. I'll take care of myself. Seems that the doctor was right about the unknown powers. Veikko! We all better get some sleep. Come, Birgit. Believe me now? We all have a beast inside us. Then we shall drown the beast. A toast to the witches! You wanted me to come. Not here, in the swamp. There I shall dance for you. For me alone? Wail... I'll come. Help me! Don't let me sink! Help me!!! - You shot at me. What if I... - I'll give you anything! - Greta? - She's the one you always longed for. Take her! - Birgit! - She's mine, you hear! Mine! Help! I'm sinking! Look at that. What are our chances? Birgit! Birgit! Birgit, You're driving me mad. - We are all mad. - Don't play with me. You, your father, all men from your family, you all have played with me. Give me the mansion. A fiery, burning gift. - In the blaze of fire I'll dance for you. - You're mad. - Eat this. - No. The seed of life, the seed of death. The seed of love. Will you let me have the mansion? Send it up in flames and I shall dance for you. Birgit! Come back! Wail! I'll do anything! You see... This is what they call healthy competition. You've all fallen for her. Even you. But you know that I love only you. - But if she came here now... - Stop worrying. She won't come here. Where did you... You called me a snake. There are snakes everywhere. - To the swamp! - To the Swamp! - Birgit, wail! I'll save you! - Back to the swamp! Birgit! Looking for me? The witch. Leave! I do not want you. But I want you. There's someone else for you and she hates me. I'll protect you. But not from yourself. Blood. Blood of a strong man, blood. I can't stand to hear her victorious laughter. One day I'll do something to her. This is all very strange, but what should we do? Didn't you ask me to pose for you? A witch... That's what you are. A witch! Make her go away, now! Oh I see. You're afraid to lose Kauko to her. - Leave! - She's mine! I found her. You wanted to meet the witch. The Devils. You ended up finding yourself, and that's not enough. Birgit... Kill her! Kill her!!! - To the swamp! - Back to the swamp! I'm loved by all men and hated by women. Oh the lust that comes from rising from the grave... To smell the marsh tea and feel the warm caress of the rain dripping down your body. Stop torturing me. I love you! Love is as abounding as the ground and as treacherous as the swamp. But you are not available. Available from where? I do not want you. I want Veikko and the mansion. My wedding bed shall be in the swamp, where marsh tea blooms and the owls cry. There she is. Catch her! She's done enough evil already. - Where's my leather bag? - I have it. I'll save you if... So be it. To the swamp! Back to the swamp! Drive a stake through her chest! - To the swamp! - Back to the swamp! - Blame yourself, witch! - Fowl beast! - Birgit! - You have no idea, how I could love you. Stop tormenting me. I'll do anything. - Witch! - Witch! Witch! - Anything? - Birgit! Look! The firebrand are glowing. Burn the mansion down! Only fire will set us free. - Then will I have you? - With fire, you shall... You're mad! To love, one must be mad! Birgit! Birgit! Witch! She lit the mansion on fire! This is the key to your witchcraft. Only I can save you. Isn't that enough to give in? Give it to me! Birgit! Birgit! She has got what's coming to her. The witch shall not return again. Hannu! Hannu! Hannu! Hannu! Greta! I'm coming! Help! The building is on fire! Hannu! Hannu! What have you done?! The fire... It's spreading... Who the fuck is trying to burn down the house?! Hannu forgot to put out his cigarette. From now on you won't be sleeping alone! But I just came back from the swamp. Veikko burned the mansion. Poor Hannu. You had one of your nightmares again. You left your cigarette on the table and it burned all your papers. There's always someone out of their mind here. He needs a good cup coffee and some strong cognac. No cognac for him in the morning. But coffee will do fine. Greta, come quick. She's waking up and her memory is returning. What... Who returns? Pretty little girl that witch. We'll see how she explains all this. It's too late for her to explain anything. Do you think a person can regain their memory if they are scared by, oh let's say, a fire? Possibly. ls that the reason you set the mansion on fire? Poor silly man, wake up already. I'll get you that coffee and maybe secretly even that drink. So first she's dead, then a witch and now she's even a pyromaniac. And I suppose the Baron has never fallen asleep with a burning cigarette? No. I smoke cigars. Anyway, it seems your husband should sleep with a firehose next time. Well, she regained her memory? Yes. Her name is Birgit Suomaa. She was swimming and wandering and was surprised by the storm, which eventually took her boat and clothes. Lightning struck close by when she was running in the swamp. That's all she remembers. - Coffee Hannu. Did you hear about it? - About what? The people were so scared, they stole the witch's body and took it back to the grave. It was me. - I rammed the stake through her heart. - What the hell are you talking about, doctor? He's always like this when he's had nightmares. Don't you believe me? The witch is no more! It's so nice to see you're back to normal. - There she is! - Now the witch truly returns to life. Stop goofing around Hannu, wake up. Please forgive me doctor, for all the fuss I've caused. You see, the lightning knocked me out. And you knocked us out. Nice to meet you again. If the artist here paints you, I'll pay with no questions asked. - In the witch's dress? - Rather not. - Now now, old man. - Now now, boy. Thank God it was just a dream. I actually thought the witch had returned to life. I feel so embarrassed. I must've acted very strange yesterday. It's alright. The good doctor was happy to carry you here from the swamp. Now Veikko, I seem to recall you were more than enthusiastic to pick some flowers. As in your time were you, old man. - By the way, where were you born? - In Suojarvi. You never went to Suojarvi now did you old man? This has taught me a hard lesson. I understand now, there's a witch inside all of us. And how easily we start hunting those around us. I have nothing against hunting witches. Evil is present in all of us. All of us are ready to impale each other for the sake of ourselves. We need to understand each other more or the witch returns to life. Forgive me Greta. For I've been crazy, because I love you more than anything. Hannu... Oh yes, the painting shall be expensive. What if I paint you both and give it to you as a gift? Oh go jump in the swamp. Subtitles timed and proof-read by anthrapoid Finnish to English translation by JerryC subtitles added to DVD by shado124
