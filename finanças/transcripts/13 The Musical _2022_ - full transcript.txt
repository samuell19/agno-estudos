Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. "Koh amair..." "Koh amar," Evan. Sorry. One second, sorry. Hello. Yeah. Yeah, hold on. It's God. He wants his language back. I'm sorry, Rabbi. I can't focus. I feel like my whole life is a dumpster fire, and I'm only 12. I don't even have a whole life yet. I get it. No, it's rough. It's rough when your folks get divorced. My mom went around the apartment cutting my dad's head out of all the photos. - No! - With her teeth. Hey, we'll get through it all. We'll study remotely. Bring your books to Indiana. It'll be fine. A Bar Mitzvah is the event that defines you. The Jewish Super Bowl. What kind of killer party can I have in Indiana? I don't even know anyone there. Hi, Rabbi Shapiro. Jessica. - Evan tells me you're doing well. - Oh yeah. The weather's great at rock bottom. - Kidding. - She's not kidding. I'm not kidding. - Hey. We'll chat when you get there, okay? - Mm-hm. High five. It's gonna be a long drive, but Grandma is so excited that we're coming. She's FaceTiming every five minutes. At least I think it's her. All I see is neck. That's me, Evan Goldman. And I live at 224 West 92nd Street in the heart of New York City. I'm about to turn 13 and have my Bar Mitzvah. It was gonna be the biggest party.

I'm okay, Mom. You're not. A mother knows. Evan. Evan! Hi, Grandma. What? I'm fine. You're not. A grandma knows. Come on. Wow, this place looks exactly the same. I'm surprised you remember. You haven't been here since you were five, but if it took a divorce to get you to come back, maybe it's a good thing. - Mom! - What? I look at the bright side. - Come on, I'll show you your room. - All righty. - I'll take the bag. - Okay. Oh my God, it's heavy. What do you have in here, rocks? Your room. Was this my mom's room? Yes, it was, but I've been using it as a yoga studio, so that might be what you smell. Sorry. Evan. I know you'll miss your friends and school and bagels. But give it a chance. When your grandfather brought me here, I didn't think I'd ever get used to it. But 50 years later, he's dead, and I'm still here buying my bras, eggs, and tires all in one store. I love you. And not just because I have to. This entire year has been lawyers and therapists and... carbs, and every mom on the Upper West Side asking, "How are you?" I needed out. So you're out. Now you can start over. Do whatever you want. You could finally write again, huh? Mom. Give me a little time, okay? Take all the time you need. Who am I to judge? But, ticktock. I'm just saying. How can anyone sleep with all this quiet? Good morning, honey. Put away your video game. So, Evan, I was thinking about your Bar Mitzvah. Okay, just curious. How many other Jews are there in Walkerton? If you include us? Us. Is there a temple? There is. It's called a church. So we'll do the party in the backyard. Oh, and I've got a boom box. You can make me a mixtape. What's a mixtape? Also, I'm new here. If my party is awful, I'll never live it down. I know it's important. We will make it good, I promise. It needs to be better than good. Okay. Tell you what. I'll plan it. - You'll plan it? - Yes. - You? - Yes. - Really? - Yes, really. So it can be everything that I want. - Fine. - Good. - Good. - Good. See? This is family. Miss Ruth! - Am I interrupting? - No! Uh, hi, Miss Ruth. Patrice. Perfect. This is my daughter, Jessica. And I know it's been a while, but you and Evan remember each other, yes? - No. - Not really. Miss Ruth, I came by to return your book. The Bell Jar. Oh, this book made me wanna be a writer. Isn't it a little sad? What's sad is you're the only one around here who knew it was sad. - Patrice, maybe you can show Evan around. - Sure. Great. - Wanna take some toast? - I'm good. Okay. - That's a cool shirt. - Thanks. I try to warn people here that they're destroying our wildlife with landfills. - And how's that going? - Landfills are part of the tour. Patrice! Patrice! - Is that Evan? - Yeah. Evan, this is Archie. - Hey, Archie. - I know what you're thinking. Yep, I'm faking it. I'm gonna show Evan around. This is around. Let me know if you run into Kendra. - Wait, who's Kendra? - An angel walking amongst us mere mortals. Cool. I can't wait to meet her. I'm not planning on running into Kendra. We'll see you later. Fine. I'll be here. Alone. The one child left behind. - Don't fall for it. - See you later, Archie! Welcome to Walkerton. If someone offers to pray for you, let them. - So what is there to do around here? - Not much. Yesterday I finished YouTube. It's not nearly as exciting as your life in New York. Exciting, right. My dad gets a midlife crisis, and I get mid-America. Now I have to have my Bar Mitzvah in Walkerton, Indiana. For us Jews, it's the one day that's supposed to be happy and perfect. See, Catholics don't have that day. It would go against everything we believe in. Back home, your party defines you. Hey, you help with my petition to phase out single-use plastic, and I'll help you plan your party. Deal. And I'll make that my Mitzvah project. Your what? When you have a Bar Mitzvah, you get to pick a charity project that helps others. This is all working out.

I'm so excited about my petition. We can set things up at lunch, and I'll show you where everything is. Eddie, Malcolm, check this out. We're in a canoe. Right? - Come on, Ev, let's get inside. - One second. I said, "Yo, dude, what happened to your toe?" And he said, "Leeches." - What? - Bro, what? - Hey, Brett got taller, huh? - No way, man. Lucy! You're totally into Brett. I did think about him all summer and... we would look good together and we are in eighth grade now. Yeah, girl! Lucy! Bestie! Hi, Mrs. Duncan! Hi, Lucy! Lucy, it was the worst summer ever. She put me in summer school. Everyone's at camp having fun, and I'm doing Bible study and Latin and violin and science while she picks out all my clothes and watches over everything I do. - Horrible! - KC! - Hey, there's Brett. - Carlos, what's up? I know! Listen, Kendra. I've been dying to tell you about how Brett... Hi, everybody! Hey, Kendra. Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. I've really missed you, Kendra. Aw! This might have been the longest summer ever. Aw! Nope! Same amount of months. - But I saved every one of our texts. - Aw! Hold up. You two have been texting? - Yeah, we have. - Yeah, we have. I thought your mom took away your phone. You hardly texted me, like, at all. Well, yeah, but whenever I could sneak it, Brett and I would text. Kendra, yeah, can we chat a sec?

No, I just think texting all summer with someone you wanna have your first kiss with is something you tell your best friend, if, you know, she really is your best friend. Don't even say that, Lucy. Of course I'm happy for you. And it will all work out. I mean, assuming no one else likes him. - Right. - Out. Kendra, check it out. Evan just invited us to his big party. - It's my Bar Mitzvah. This fall. - What's a Bar Mitzvah, exactly? It's this Jewish thing where they make you talk backwards and everyone gets circumcised. What? Uh! N... No! It's a party. With dancing. And a DJ. It'll be awesome. Oh. Actually, my friend, Patrice, helped me plan it. Patrice? That Patrice? Sign the petition for compostable cutlery. Do what's right. Not easy. That was easy. Yeah, maybe not. Ooh. She's good people. She, you know, just does her own thing. Patrice. No, she thinks she's better than everyone. Whatever, Lucy. Evan, can we talk? One second, guys. What is going on, Patrice? - That's who you wanna hang out with? - I dunno. They seem cool. Is that what you want? To be "cool"? - I want them to come to my party. - Why? Because it's my Bar Mitzvah. I need a great party. What's your problem with them? Any group that has room for Lucy Hallman is not a group that I need to be part of. How about this? They come to my Bar Mitzvah, and you and me have our own party. Just us. Boom. Everyone's happy. You did not just say that. Whatever's going on between you all, I can help fix it. Whatever. I don't even care. Patrice, I... Archie, what just happened? Middle school. - Juice box? - Thanks, Zee. Sometimes it helps just to puncture something. You don't have to help me. I wanna be useful. Jessica! There are seven trillion nerves in the human body, and you are getting on every one of mine. Find something to do. I know. You could finally write your novel. What would I write about? That my son resents me for blowing up his life? Or that after putting my own life on hold so my husband could build up his law firm, he betrays me, so our marriage implodes? Or the kicker, I'm sleeping in the room where my mom keeps her orthopedic shoes because just when I've stopped asking, "How can things get any worse," I find myself starting completely over. - That's what I should write about? - I'll clear off your father's old desk. Thank you. Set! - Okay, Kendra, spill the tea! - Okay. Brett wants to kiss me, and I wanna kiss him back. Fun, right? Just remember, you only get one shot. Do it wrong, someone loses a tongue. - Are you sure you're ready? - Wait, Lucy, what's that scent? Is that jealousy? First of all, blend your contour before you come at me like that, Charlotte. And second, we know how it works. Problem is, her mom will never let her be alone with him. We'll find a spot my mom won't know about. I always do what she tells me. I wanna decide something for myself. Be my own person, for once. - Mmm? - And that person wants to kiss Brett! Great. Call the motions. Right. Here. We.

They're pancakes. Okay. What's going on with your party planning? You haven't told me anything. - Oh, I'm working on it. - Is Patrice still helping you? She didn't come around yesterday like she usually does. See, the thing is, I have a lot of friends now, and, you know, it's just fine. - Joel? - Hey, is Evan around? Uh... - Yeah, he's right here. - My friend's here. I gotta go. - Evan, talk to your father. - Bye. Sorry, Joel, he ran off. I've been trying to reach him, but he won't answer my calls. Well, give him time. He's adjusting. Has he said anything about wanting me to come for the Bar Mitzvah? I will ask him again. Is he gonna be okay? Now? Now you're wondering if he's gonna be okay? I'll keep trying him. Come on, Eddie. Throw it to me. Come on! Let's go! Whoa! Hey, Patrice! Patrice! What is it, Archie? - How come you haven't answered my texts? - Because I don't understand them. What's "H-C-Y-H-A-M-T"? How Come You Haven't Answered My Texts. Duh. What is it, Archie? You don't have to be mad at me 'cause you're mad at Evan. I'm not mad at him. All he cares about is that everyone comes to his party. Come on, he's just trying to fit in. Why are you defending him? Well, don't get mad at me. I'm upset too. If Kendra and Brett kiss, where does that leave me? I thought he was my friend, Archie. Oh man, Brett, you're good at, like, everything you do. Thanks. You know, I also play the guitar, and... Okay, you think I could play something at your party? - I also write my own songs. A little. - For real? Yeah, for anyone. I'm kinda good. I wrote one song called "Kendra," right? Oh, there's also, "Hey, Kendra." There's "Hey, Is Kendra Home?" I wrote that one while walking to her front door. Yes, you can play at my party. Thank you. Sorry about your parents breaking up. Mine did too, a few years ago. I hated it. I guess the hardest part for me was having to leave home. I couldn't imagine leaving here. It's where my stuff is. But also, there's... ♪ Kendra over there ♪ Man, I wanna kiss her. If you both wanna kiss so much, just kiss. It has to be somewhere special. Something she'll always remember. You know? Come on.

And it seems important that we all come to this party of yours because, well, if there's a party and I tell people not to come... there isn't a party. Why do I feel there's more to this chat than the one we're currently having? Here's the problem. You need people at your party. I need to make sure Brett and Kendra don't kiss at this movie on Friday, which was your idea. Why don't you want Brett and Kendra to k... Oh. You see my dilemma. Of course, Kendra's my best friend, and I could never hurt her, so... You help me, I help you. It's quid pro quo! How am I supposed to stop them from getting together if they like each other? You're the guy with all the answers. You'll figure it out. Aw, I'm so glad we're friends. Aren't you? Bye! Set! Set! All right, everyone, let's try this again. Ready, Lucy? Five, six, seven... - Hey, Archie. How you doing? - Pretty good. I guess Patrice is still pretty mad at me, huh? Well, you chose those guys over her. My guess is she hates you. Oh, let me grab my bag. Oh! Cute shirt, Archie. Did you see that? Way to play it cool, Arch. If I could have ten minutes sitting next to her, I would know that I had not lived my life in vain. - Does she know you like her? - Oh. I think she misinterpreted my flirting for food poisoning. Of course, in her defense, I did throw up after. What if I told you I had a way for you to sit next to Kendra for two hours? Next to her in the same building? Next to her in the next seat at the movies on Friday. Don't toy with me. Here's the thing. Lucy is holding my party hostage unless I stop Brett and Kendra from kissing. Okay, I'm listening. All right, it's pretty complicated, but hear me out. What if you sit on the other side of Kendra... - I'm in! - There's more. Okay, keep going. Then, at the perfect moment, you faint on Kendra's shoulder, drawing her attention and blocking Brett from kissing her. Oh! And I get to kiss Kendra instead. What? No. The plan is, you make a scene and block the kiss, and no one will get mad at you because... Because I'm charming. Yeah, that. Lucy gets what she wants, and everyone comes to my party. And I get to kiss Kendra. You keep saying that as though it's part of the plan. It's not. You saved all my old journals? I thought I told you to throw out all my old stuff? When did you say that? When I left home and said, "Throw out all my old stuff." - Oh! Jess. - Mom. Jess. - You know what I miss? - Subtlety? Teaching. It gave me purpose. You were really good at it. You went to college, worked harder than anyone, and earned your BFA. You were a writer. That was your purpose. And if it took a divorce to light a fire under your tuchus, maybe that's a good thing. I'm just saying, again.. I'm gonna get some stuff then I'm gonna hang out with Archie. No, wait... Oh no... We're supposed to have dinner together. And you have a Hebrew lesson. - I'll reschedule it for tomorrow. - No... Evan. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come back. You have blown us off every night. You won't answer your father's calls. You haven't talked to me about your Bar Mitzvah. And now, skipping lessons? - What is going on? - Nothing. You wanted to move here and for me to make new friends, so here I am, making new friends. - At least I'm trying. - Look, this is about you. You will do your lesson with the rabbi, and then you will see your friends. You're his mother. He's watching what you do. - That's all I've got to say. - Yeah. I doubt that. Archie! Archie! - I can't talk right now. - Do you wanna come for dinner? I've got a whole list of movies where Americans do bad English accents. All right, fine, you broke me. We're all going to The Bloodmaster. Evan made a plan where I block Brett from kissing Kendra so Lucy will bring everyone to his party. Wait, Evan is using you just to save his party? Yeah, and I'm good with that. - This is wrong, Archie. - Stay out of it, Patrice. I like what you're doing, but think about... And this could just be fun... Just... not getting the beit and the kaf confused. Except, they're confusing. Hmm. You find a 6,000-year-old language confusing. Now I see the problem. You thought this would be easy. That just... That's just bad intel. I'm sorry, there's something important I need to do. More important than your Bar Mitzvah? One moment. God, you're gonna love this. No, it's Goldman again. Really, Rabbi, trust me. This can't wait. You want me to go full rabbi on you? I'm gonna go... I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go full rabbi. Kippah coming on. Boom. Respect. Respect the yarmulke. Look, I'm not here to tell you what you should or shouldn't do, okay? You gotta find your own way. I just... I've just walked a few more steps than you, and maybe I can help you stumble a few less than I did. Really, I'm not avoiding my lesson. It's your choice. But listen to this, okay? Look, how you do one thing is how you do everything, and what you're not doing is learning your haftorah. Seriously. It's not even Hebrew. You sound like an injured dolphin. Really? Oh. We'll talk soon.

I'm, like, getting notes of jalapeños and bowling shoes. That's good, right? Yeah, yeah... That's fine. Really?

Yeah, I'm kinda nervous. - Hey, Kendra. - Hey. Hi! Mission Popcorn Pileup accomplished. - Thank you. - Great job, Evan. I can't believe you pulled this off. This better work. Or you'll be lighting that birthday menorah alone. That's Hanukkah. Heidi, so cool that your cousin, who escaped prison, let us use his cabin here in the isolated mountains. Look, there's blood everywhere. He said he was going to look for some tools in the toolshed. Yo, there you are. I was worried that you were... - I'll never sleep again! - This is awesome! We have to run. Let's split up. Yeah. They... Get off! Kurt, if we're about to be cut into pieces, then let's have one last kiss. Oh! He's going in. This is on. Ooh! - Kendra Duncan! - Oh my God. - Mom?! - Cassie Connor! Everyone under the age of 17, out! - How'd you find out? - Who did this? Evan Goldman! - Huh? - Evan? Seriously? Goldman? - Evan? - You did this? Evan, you said I could kiss Kendra. - What? - No! Evan, what did you do? Dude, why would you do this? No way we're coming to your party now. - Come on. - What is going on? No, no, no! No! Have you seen the poster for it? It's just made of blood! I can't believe this. Get up. I'm sorry. I just wanted to have some fun for once. Do something I wanted. I trusted you, and this is what happens. Kendra! Stay away from my daughter. Go. I can't believe you all did this. Archie, are you okay? Okay? You messed up my one chance to kiss Kendra. I was just trying to help you. Okay, why does everyone think I need help? I have my own parking space, my own bathroom, the best ride in town. I'm great. You two clearly need more help than I do. I can't believe you told. You were using Archie just so people would come to your party. Or maybe you purposely wanted tonight to fail so no one would come to my party. You took advantage of my friend. It's not me that ruined everything. Archie, wait up. Are you okay? No. I was about to kiss Kendra. Yeah, but... Do you think she really would have gone through with it? Yeah, she was... I mean, she was worried her mom would get furious. Maybe she wouldn't have. Really? I can't believe this. I trusted you... Maybe you've been waiting all summer for someone who isn't ready for you, instead of someone who is, you know, ready for an opportunity like this. Let's get out of here, boyfriend. Wait, what? - Tell me not to kill him. - Don't kill him. - Too late. - Jessica! That was your room once. Remember what it felt like to sit on that bed when you messed up. Set! Hut! Man, what's up? Are you possessed? - 'Cause I've seen that at church. - You need to fix your wig. Brett, you stood there like you've never seen a football before. - It's a football. - Brett! - Ah. - See? I can't focus. And every time she kisses me, I forget why I don't want her to kiss me. You know, it's like my brain stops working. Brett! I'm texting you! Sorry, y'all. I gotta... - This is bad. - This is bad. I've been texting you. What? I'm on the field. You should have your phone on you. I've been texting and calling you. What? When I'm on the field?

Hey, Dad. Hey, kiddo. Um, Mom says you're having a rough time. You wanna talk? I think I've done some stuff that has really hurt other people. Ev, sometimes we make choices that... that inadvertently hurt the people we love the most. And sometimes those mistakes aren't easy to fix, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Does that ever work? You answered the phone this time so, um, if you're lucky, it does. I know, but you saw what happened. I have to go. Okay, kiddo. And Ev... I'm sorry that I hurt you and your mother. Thank you. I miss you. Me too. Okay, I'm running to my locker. Why? Brett, as your best friends, we need to tell you, keep it together. I'm trying! She's got some kind of, like, hypnotic hold on you, and we have no idea what it is. Well, some of us know what it is, but you gotta be strong, Brett. For us. I miss Kendra. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I don't know what to do. Maybe I can help. You? You're the reason this all happened. Look, I know I screwed things up, but I wanna make it right. Hear me out. Fine.

I think you ruined your life. Trust me, I know how that works. Patrice, I know I messed up. We both did. I shouldn't have made you choose between me and them. I just want you at my party. Let me think about it, okay? Patrice! Hi! Are you ever coming by to say hello anymore? What? You look like all the oceans dried up. Miss Ruth, what if you're really mad at someone who did something that really hurt you and you don't know how to not be mad anymore? I can tell you this. If you push away everyone who ever makes a mistake, all you'll be left with is yourself. And that would be an even bigger mistake. I wish I was as smart as you. And I wish I was as young as you. We work with what we have, huh? I don't understand ties. It's like your neck is a gift. Come here. There you go. There. I am proud of you. What... What happened? It was all going so well. My son is a man. You're totally embarrassing me. You're totally embarrassing me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I promise, I... There'll be more of this today. Come here. - God I love you. - I love you too. Honey, fast. Will do. - Seat belt. - All right. Thank you. Evan. I have something for you. And this was your grandfather's first yarmulke. He'd want you to wear it. Just don't smell it. Take my word. - Thank you, Grandma. - I love you. Love you too. - I'll see you in there. - Okay. Yo, guys. - What's up? - What's up? - How you feelin'? - Really good. I'm feeling good! - Oh man! - You did good, Jess. - Be proud. - I am. Of course, I helped. Rabbi Shapiro, you made it! Ah! So here we are. You worked hard for this. And I had to listen to all of it, so good for us. - How you feeling? - Well, I'm having my Bar Mitzvah. Just not where I thought or how I thought or with who I thought, but, you know... - So don't believe everything you think. - Yeah. Not a lot of Jews around here, huh? Least I'm the hottest rabbi somewhere. You know, you were right. This is more important than a dope party. I just said that so you'd study. - Let's rock this suburb. - Oh yeah! - High five, baby! - My man! - Hey, Dad. - Hey. Thanks for letting me come. That is a killer suit. Bet the, uh, girls are all over you. That is the most dad line in the world. How about giving your dad a hug? You know, I'm looking forward to next summer. Yeah, me too. All right, Mr. Goldman. Showtime. What happens if I mess up? Then you take a big breath, and you do it better the next time, or at least you try. Okay? Okay. - Ooh. Family selfie. - I'll see you in there. Come on. Look at this. - Some of that, oh. - All right. Right on. Ready? Look at that. One, two, three. That's awesome. That's awesome. All righty. Hi, Joel. It's good you came. You look great. I know. I feel like I missed out on some important stuff here. Thanks for not giving up on him. Hmm. Um... A Jewish olive branch. Oh! Thank you. Oh! Thank you. Hm. You know, I'm writing again. - Really? - Mm-hm. A novel. - That's not gonna end well for me, is it? - Probably not. Yeah. Kendra, wait. Lucy, what are you doing here? I came to say I'm sorry. I was really hurt you didn't text me all summer but were talking to Brett. I know. I should have just told you. Of course he would like you. Everyone likes you. You're really smart. You get all A's. You're really lucky. Sorry I messed everything up. I figured if I had Brett, I could feel important to somebody. You've always been important to me. I was wrong, and I really miss you. I really miss my best friend. I miss you too. Let's never let a boy come between us again. Hashem, who created the heavens, gives a soul to the people and a spirit to all who walk upon it.
