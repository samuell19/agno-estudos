(moody acoustic guitar music) (thunder rumbles) (wind howls) (rain splashes) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (men grunt) - [Man] Come on, you bunch of lazy sissies! The water's risin'! I don't wanna get my tools wet, you know what I mean? - Yeah, all right. Okay, bye. It's comin' right up the river. - Oh, man. (thunder rumbles) - We got confirmation. Lyla's comin', north-northwest. Category two. - All marine operators, be advised, tropical storm Lyla has been upgraded to hurricane status. Projection is she'll hit New Orleans within the next five hours. We're reporting turbulent conditions at the mouth of the river and barometric pressure at 28.29 and falling. Mississippi levee has been breached in several places and pumping capacity has been exceeded. New Orleans Traffic, Broadbeck here. - Hey, Donna, Hayley and I were just delivering food to the guys who are working on the levee, again. - [Donna] (chuckles) Okay, well it looks like we got some weather comin' down on us, hon. - (chuckles) Come on, it's barely even blowing here. - Well, Lyla's just been upgraded to hurricane status, so maybe you and the gals oughta come and stay at my place tonight. - You know what, it's really sweet of you to offer, Donna, and I don't mean any offense by this, but you guys always say that the hurricane is gonna wreck the world, and it barely even ruffles the swamp grass. - [Donna] I got plenty of chocolate, and booze. - Donna, Donna, we're gonna be fine, really. - All right. - Okay, thank you. Bye. You have a headache, ladybug? - I'm fine, Mom. - You know what, let's get you home right now, come on. (thunder rumbles) - We gotta get more guys out on that line. Take some of those sandbaggers, and get 'em to the west corner. Then eventually we'll get over to the preschool, one second. Broadbeck. - Hey, Hayley and I are on our way back to the house. I'd like Nicole back as quick as you can, please. - Hey, you know what? We're having a bit of a tough day here, okay? I'll get her back as soon as I can. - Nick's not gettin' too wet, is she? - [Broadbeck] Nah, she looks okay. She looks like she's havin' some fun. - [Man] Slow down, man! What, you see me lookin' at you? What's goin' on there, boy? - You know what, I'll call you back, all right? (men yell over each other) All right, we are outta here. - No, Dad, please stop. - Now, right now! Some chains on those guys over there. - Policy is no chains on low flight risks. - Okay. - Break it up! Break it up! Break it up! - Shoot somebody, huh! Batter one out, boys, they fightin'! - You oughta focus on the line, man. (strong wind blows) - [Mrs. Broadbeck] Oh, no, they're closed. - [Hayley] No gas? - Well, I think we just hit empty, so that means-- - 25 miles left. - 25 miles left. That's right. (moody acoustic guitar music) - River's rising, ladies. Now, some of our guys are on work detail. Get to breathe clean air. Get to eat home cooked food. Get to look at all the pretty local ladies. But the state reckons that you guys are too dangerous. (laughs) Are you dangerous, Mr. Simpson? - We're gonna find you some so you can help out here. - If we're not gonna have fun-- - Hey! - [Nicole] Oh, yeah, this hat is good. (siren wails) Come on, let me push it. - Uh-uh. Give me my hat back. (Nicole giggles) All right. Uh-uh, uh-uh. - Wait, Dad, I wanna use the radio and everything. (distant thunder claps) (door slams) - What? - I like it here, Mom. - Yeah, it's great. - I really like it here. - I know, ladybug. Come on, let's get inside before the rain comes on. (somber music) (thunder rumbles) - Delphi! Gerald! Defurdu! Paul! Budroux! Timido! Jefferson! Simpson! You're on the next crew out, let's move. - [Mr. Broadbeck] 10-23. - Arrive on the scene. - 10-70. - [Nicole] Firefight. - [Mr. Broadbeck] All right, what's a 10-56 with a 10-88? - That's you, Dad. - Come on, what is it? - It's a drunk guy with a possible gun. - [Mr. Broadbeck] (chuckles) Okay, what's a 10-100? - [Nicole] Oh, ew, that's really gross! That's when you gotta go, you know, pee. Then what's a 10-200, Dad? - Uh, that's enough, I think we're finished with this. (clock ticks) Hello! - [Hayley] Hi, Daddy! - Hey. - Did you see Josh at the river? - [Mrs. Broadbeck] Josh, your lab partner? - No. - What, Josh Delacoy? - There are at least 10 Joshes in my class. - Well, which Josh are we talking about? - One of them. I'm gonna go call Jill, okay? - Oh, hey, the phone's dead. - [Nicole] So, no internet? I have mid-terms. - Oh, god, you're gonna have to use a pen! - Don't try to be funny, okay? You're not real good at it. - I'll help you study. - They said that, um, that it might get real bad out here tonight. Why don't you and the girls come and stay at my place tonight? - You know, we've weathered storms here before. We'll be fine. - Look like you're ready to move tomorrow. (Mrs. Broadbeck sighs) - They want me to start next week. - I thought we'd agreed that you'd wait until after Christmas, after the semester break? For the girls. - It's a really good job at my old station. - So, that's it? - My new place is modern, so, I'm gonna leave all the antiques for you. - Do you remember how hard, how long we worked for this house? - That was a long time ago. (somber music) - I've apologized at least 1,000 times. I know that I messed up, okay? - Yeah, you did. - Sorry isn't good enough? - No. It's not. - What happened to Hayley happened to all of us. - So, that makes it okay that you had an affair? - Must be a burden being a saint. (Mrs. Broadbeck sighs) (Mrs. Broadbeck sobs) (thunder rumbles) (moody acoustic guitar music) (thunder claps) (thunder rumbles) (rain splashes) (thunder claps) - Uh, Mom? - (chuckles) Always prepared. - No, I'm not. - Really? Where are all the extra candles? (thunder rumbles) - That's better. - For now. (laughs ominously) I'm just kidding. - Did I wear this when I was a baby? - Both of you did. (wind howls) (rain splashes) (thunder claps) - All right, let's go, guys, get on the bus! It's wet out here! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Come on, come on, move it, move it! (suspenseful music) I said move it, convicts! (thud) - Back off, fool! (thunder claps) (thuds) What's up with you, man? Come on! Get off me! - All right, all right, let's get on the bus! It's wet out here, let's get on the bus! (thunder claps) (prisoners yell) - Well, this looks like an opportunity. Go, go, go, go, go! (coughs) - Get on the bus, it's wet out here! Get on the bus! - This way. Look out. (coughs) Come on. (thunder claps) (thud) (Simpson groans) (thunder claps) (suspenseful music) (prisoners pant) - What the hell? I don't recall sendin' out invitations. - I see me an opportunity, I take it. (gun cocks) (Simpson groans) - Hey! Get down, boy. Get down! - I'm not even gonna ask you where you got that thing. - It's all part of a plan. - Well, so count us in! - Really? What good are you? (coughs) - Damn! I'm Tad. He's Juke. We're your new best friends. (distant thunder claps) (Simpson groans) (engine roars) (muffled chatter) - All right, can you help me out? Yeah, that's what I wanted, now you're talkin', okay! - How you doin' tonight? - I'm goin' good, thanks! Hey, Captain, how you doin'? - All right, Chief! - Good, good, good! Are these guys a little better behaved than that last group that you brought in here? - Oh, yeah, these aren't worse than these guys. Mostly dumpers, they won't give you any problems. - All right, good, good! - Where do you need 'em? - We're gonna have you guys fill out the guys with Black, and the other guys from North District, all right? They've been workin' all night long and they're just beat. So have these guys grab some more sand, brought 'em in a little bit later. - Okay! - Okay, you guys got it? - Let's do it, come on, men! (thunder rumbles) (muffled pop music) - What's wrong? - Does there have to be something wrong for us to talk? - You're the mother. - [Mother] You're gonna make new friends, honey. - I don't want to make new friends. I don't want to move to Chicago, I wanna stay here with Dad. - I'm afraid that's just impossible. - Yeah? Well, I hope you don't think you're gonna become a big TV weather star again, because these days, weather forecasters actually have to know what they're talking about. (mother sighs) (rain splashes) - All right, man. - Hey, why are we stoppin'? - This is it. - What's it? - This is where we're meetin' a ride. - Well, hallelujah! - Hey, hey! (Tad chuckles) Where you goin'? - I need some smokes, I'm hungry! - And what're you wearin'? - You reckon somebody might notice, huh? (Simpson spits) - See if you can find us somethin' to wear. And keep your head down! - [Guard] Where do you think you're goin'? - I was supposed to get off three hours ago. I got plans, I ain't stayin' any longer. - We have to stay until someone can make it through the storm to relieve us. - Do you really think anyone's tryin' to get here? Hell, next shift's sittin' at home, drinkin' beer, waitin' out the storm. (buzzer rings) - Warden says we stay, we stay. (crooked guard sighs) (rain splashes) (muffled music) (distant thunder rumbles) - Where the hell are your wheels, man? My ass is cold! - Why don't you go see you can hot-wire one of those trucks? - What makes you think I can hot-wire a truck? (thunder rumbles) (Juke sighs) - [Tad] Now, this is what I'm talkin' about. Big ol' Ford V8 gettin' you down the highway, all safe and sound. (laughs) - [Donna] New Orleans Traffic, Broadbeck here. - [Mr. Broadbeck] Hey, Donna, it's me. How bad is this gonna get? - Yeah, well, Hurricane Center is saying category two, and captain of the port's already shut down the river altogether. - I guess we're just gonna have to ride it out. - Yeah, we're gonna have to. Look, I tried to get Cassie to stay in town. - Yeah, me too. - [Donna] You're not really gonna let them leave, are ya? - [Broadbeck] Donna, this is my business, okay? - (chuckles) It's my business when my nieces are movin' 1,000 miles away and my brother is miserable. - Well, what do you want me to say, huh? - Look, Wayne, you cannot let her get away. - Yeah. (thunder claps) (engine hums) - Hey, oh, hang on! (grunts) (water splashes) (prisoners grunt) (rain splashes) Everybody okay? (coughs) (Simpson grunts) Well, this plan sucks! - Then go on back to prison, you squawkin' peacock. - What now? (distant thunder claps) - Who's a good swimmer? (moody acoustic guitar music) - [Reporter] And Hurricane Lyla is headed towards the New Orleans area at better than 75-- - Mom, listen. - [Reporter] All residents of low-lying areas are being advised to get inland to higher ground. Stay tuned to this station for updates as more information becomes available. - We're in a low-lying area. - Oh, sweetie, we've been through this before. It's gonna veer off, they usually do. (moody acoustic guitar music) (prisoners grunt and pant) - [Simpson] Switch! We're driftin', get on the other side! Just paddle straight! (prisoners grunt) - Here, help! - Pull it up! - Let's just get outta here! (thunder claps) - Come on now. (groans) (suspenseful music) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (knocks) - I'll get it. (suspenseful music) (knocks) - [Nicole] Hayley, who is it? Hayley! - There some pretty girls. (ominous music) - It's okay. - Hello. - Mom? Mom? - What do you want? (Tad chuckles) - What do we want? (thunder claps) (water splashes) Anyone else in the house? (water splashes) (sighs and grunts) (grunts) (tense music) I asked you, was there anyone else in the house? - No, no one. (Simpson blows sharply) - Well, then. Cash and car keys. If you oblige us, then we'll be on our way. - I don't have any cash. - She forgets to go to the ATM. - Who's this? (Tad chuckles) - My daughter is not well. (Simpson sniffs) - Cash and car keys. - I said I don't have any cash. But we'll go get the car keys, come on, girls. - Girls stay here. - It'll be much quicker if they-- - The girls! Stay here. (thunder claps) - Run! Run! (tense music) Go! Go! (thuds) (Juke grunts) The chair, the chair! Okay, go, go run! Run, front door, go, go! (girls scream) (thunder claps) (Juke grunts) (glass smashes) - Stop, come here! - Where are you goin'? - Stop, don't move, stop! Get back over here, move, stop! (Nicole screams) (suspenseful music) - One quick twist. (grunts) (thud) (screams) - Mom! - Mom! - Next time, listen. Anyone else outside? - No, it's just us chickens. - Hand me that bat. Keys, please. - I think they're in my purse. (thunder claps) Oh. Can I... - Hurry up. (thunder claps) - Who knocked off the local library? - They're Daddy's. - "The History of Western Civilization." Is that about them cowboys? - Yeah! (thunder rumbles) - Huh. It ain't got no pictures in it, look at that. How'd she get that scar? (chuckles) - She was in an accident. - I got me a scar. - Good for you. - Come on, hurry up. - Okay. Oh, they're not here. - You gotta find them. - [Cassie] Break into the car. There's a key in the glove box. - It's a nice car, if I break the window, it all shut off. - Well, it has one of those keypad things, and my daughter probably knows the code. - This is bad, come on! She can't find the keys. - Well, then. We got ourselves a problem, don't we? - [Cassie] Nicole, you know the code to the keyless? - Yeah, of course I know. - There's a spare key in the glove box. - Now... Little girl. You wouldn't be tryin' to trick us, would ya? - I don't care about a car. (thunder claps) (engine starts) (horn honks) (thunder claps) - Okay, girls, we're going to the neighbors', go! (tense music) Cell phone, where are you? - Mom! - Get the rain gear! - Rain gear, rain gear. - Can't Daddy help us? - Baby, we are on our own and I need you, I need you. - I'm really trying, Mom. - I know, I know you are. But right now, we've gotta get to the Wilkinsons', okay? Go get the flashlights, go, go, go! (rain splashes) (tense music) (thunder claps) (women scream) - Don't know what you're thinkin'. We ran outta gas, we'd be so far away we wouldn't come back? - Okay, look, just go to the neighbors. You don't even have to bother them, they keep a spare key on the right front tire of their sedan. - Sedan? (chuckles) Wasn't that just like a woman, huh? Yeah. She wants the scum out of her own yard, but she doesn't care if it lands in her neighbor's yard. Well, a sedan ain't gonna help us, 'cause the roads are flooded. - Phone's been out, phone's been out for hours. (phone thuds) (thunder claps) (rain splashes) (thunder rumbles) - [Sheriff] Come on, come on, let's move it! - Hey, Captain, what's goin on, we need guys! - We're on lockdown, we've been ordered back to the prison! - Did you have an escape? - Aw, come, I'm not supposed to say-- - I don't care, damn it! We live in this community, our families are here! How many? - Three, but we'll have 'em back before dawn! - All right, but how dangerous? - No, I'm not supposed to talk about it! We got a forger, we got a petty thief, and we got a first-timer, statutory rape. Not our worst guys! - That's pretty bad! - Sorry, Chief, I gots to go! - Yeah, thanks a lot! (thunder claps) - [Tad] We need to get on the move. - [Simpson] Don't worry, Tadly. Got some fine shelter, some good food, and some lovely company. (groans) - Huh, well, shake a tail feather there. I love bubblegum. (bat thuds) I'll save it for later. - "Cassandra. "Broadbeck." You're quite a looker, ain't ya? You should be on TV. - She used to be. She did the weather in Chicago, that's why we're going back. - [Simpson] Bet you wish you were there now. (groans) - Mom, what happened to his leg? - I don't know, honey. - It's a badge of honor for a man who took a chance. - Shut up. - You're escaped convicts, aren't you? - How you reckon? - That tourniquet's made from a prison uniform. - Well, they made us work down at that river with no pay, so we take our pay out in freedom, by god. - [Juke] Why don't you shut up? - If you were on the river crew, you are not important criminals. (phone rings) - Find that phone. (phone rings) - Move. - Find the phone! (thunder claps) (phone rings) (rain splashes) (phone rings) - You quit pushin' me around? - Just shut up. (rain splashes) - Where the hell did that woman leave that damn phone? - There's gotta be another room. - Phone's quit ringin', how are we supposed to find it? I can't find no damn phone. Where is it? - That was my dad. He'll be here soon. - Them roads, they all washed out. - Daddy has an all-terrain vehicle. - Really? - You won't be so happy when he gets here. He's a fire chief. - But Daddy doesn't live here anymore, since he had a girlfriend. - [Nicole] Hayley. - Did Daddy tell you that? - Like we couldn't hear you guys arguing. - Well, there goes the portrait of the perfect happy family, doesn't it? All that passion, and yet, an ice queen. - Excuse me? (bat thuds) (gasps) - I said you were an ice queen, Cassandra, an ice queen! Would you like me to define it for you? An ice queen is a woman whose man ain't allowed to be a man. Oh, there's a reason a man cheat. Turn abusive, turn bad, turn mean. Is because of women like you. You don't behave as a real woman should, and then you scream and cry and whine and moan when your husband seeks pleasure elsewhere. Well, you're the one who should suffer! Now find me that phone! - Stay close. (thunder claps) (suspenseful music) - That's better. (thunder claps) (phone rings) - [Man] Hello. - [Simpson] The hell are you? - Right where I'm supposed to be. - Well, you're late. - Hey, you're the one that didn't wait. If you're tryin' to screw me, man. - Enough! Now, listen, I'm on the coast bayou and the address is... - 2343 Shoreline Drive. - 2343 Shoreline Drive, get here. - More importantly, where the hell is my money? - Don't worry about your money, friend. You'll get your money when I get on that boat. (thunder claps) (engine roars) (thunder claps) - Just where the holy hell are you at, Larry? - Earle. There's been a little complication. (Simpson groans) (thunder claps) - You need a doctor. - Mom took a first aid class. - Come here, I got somethin' to show you. Well, doctor. What do you make of this? (Cassie groans) - I, um, I don't know what to do for that. (Simpson screams) (yelps) (chuckles) (thunder claps) - What's wrong with it? - It's probably broken. - That's very perceptive. You have a first aid kit in the house? - [Cassie] In the back bathroom. - Got any cigarettes, little girl? - Her name's Nicole. - [Tad] You got any cigarettes, Nicole? - We don't smoke in this house. - That ain't what I asked. - Leave 'em alone, Tadly. - It's Tad! Not Tadly! - Walk away, Tadly. - [Tad] Hey, peaches! Where's that first aid kit? - You there, blondie. What's your name? - Nicole. - Nicole, blondie. You cook us up somethin' to eat? - Yeah. - Go on. - Okay, come on, Hayley, let's go. - Woo-hoo! (laughs) I done found me some real silver! (laughs) - Go watch the girls. - I ain't no babysitter. (silverware clatters) Rat bastard. - Ah. - You can't leave a tourniquet tied too long. I don't have to do anything. Look at you. Your skin is gray and clammy. You're probably going into shock. - What've you got here? (thunder claps) - Y'all got any of them bowl peanuts in the can? Well, do ya? I'll just look for 'em. I like them Cajun style canned peanuts. My momma, she used to make 'em right there in the stove. Can't hardly get them no more. (tense music) - Listen. If you let my daughters go... I'll do anything you want. (Juke clears his throat) - [Simpson] Disinfect it. - It's gonna hurt. - That's all right. I like pain. (screams) (thunder claps) (tires screech) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (phone keypad bleeps) (thunder rumbles) - New Orleans Traffic, Broadbeck here. - Hey, Donna, it's me. Have you heard from Cassie? - No, but uh, North Shore has lost power and phone service. - [Wayne] Yeah and there's three escaped convicts. - Yeah, I know, you worry too much. - You know, I'd feel better if I knew the girls were safe. Is Highway 12 above water? - No, but you can bypass via 21. - [Wayne] Right, right, right, good. - Look, Wayne, don't do anything crazy. You know Cassie can be pretty tough. - Yeah, don't I know it? (Donna laughs) - Oh, listen, I gotta hop. I got a high-interest vehicle looking for safe berth. - Chemical? - No, explosives. - [Wayne] You love this stuff, don't you? - Oh, that's me. "Hello, my name is Donna and I'm a storm junkie." - There's gotta be a 12-step program for that somewhere. - [Donna] God, I hope not. - Bye. - What've we got here? "With codeine!" That sounds pretty good. That's a pretty girl in the tutu. And look, it's a family portrait. All smiles and lovey-dovey. (laughs) Hey. What's that? - Seasoning. (Tad coughs) - [Tad] Yeah. - [Hayley] I don't like that. - Maybe Miss Hayley would like some in the sandwich. - He wants to know what's takin' so long. - [Tad] Just makin' some food. Hot and spicy. - What's in the sandwiches? - Tuna. - I'm gonna get me some of that chili right there. That looks pretty good there, look at that. Good ol' bowl of chili never hurt nobody. Right there. Yes, indeed. Mm-hm. Hey, Nicky, you got any of them long neck cold beers? - No drinkin'. - Simpson, I'm gettin' sick and tired of your big-ass pete attitude. I'm my own man. I do what I wanna do. - So do I. (thunder rumbles) - All right then. We cool. (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - "Broadbeck." Oh, the husband. (phone rings) (phone rings) (suspenseful music) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hello? - Oh, Cassie. Thank god. I just got off the phone with Donna, and she said that this storm's gonna get really really bad. How is it up there at the house? - Wayne, you worry too much, the girl's are fine! - [Wayne] What? - I said, we're fine, all of us. - You know what, you're breaking up here. - What? I can't hear you. - There's been a prison break. - [Cassie] Really? - Just lock the door, okay, Cassie? Can you hear me? - Stop worrying, Wayne. (Simpson sniffs) Look, this connection is impossible. We'll just see you tomorrow. - Awful friendly for a woman who's leaving her husband. Phone. - In case you're interested, they know you escaped. - [Simpson] Yeah, well, they got bigger fish to fry. - [Man] Hey, Chief, the water's comin' over our barrier! We're losin' it down here! - Right, I read ya, I'm on my way. (thunder claps) (engine roars) - Pardon me. This is delicious. Ain't nothin' wrong with that chili. Not one thing. (thunder rumbles) (thunder claps) Don't look like she gonna pass over any time soon. (thunder claps) (glass smashes) (groans) (groans) (grunts wildly) - Feel better now? - Better than your gimpy ass. All right, you, get over there and clean that mess up. All right, then. Hell, I get it. Bunch of son of bitches. - Mom, you know that book, "A Separate Piece?" - Yeah. - It's about two boys who are best friends. One of them dies. - Okay. - He dies because he breaks his leg, and the bone marrow gets into his blood stream and kills him. (glass smashes) (yelps) (ominous music) (glass smashes) - Clean up the dishes, pretty please? (thunder claps) - Nicole, do not antagonize these men. - They're here because you forgot to put gas in the car, again. - Nick, listen to me. - No, no, it's okay, I'm taking care of the problem. Since you won't. - What did you do? - [Nicole] Everybody knows you gotta take them out one guy at a time. - Tell me what you did. Nicole, you have no idea how dangerous these men are. - Yeah, I do, Mom, okay? I do, and that's exactly why we shouldn't just wait and see if they're going to kill us, because the odds, yeah, they're not in our favor. (thunder claps) - What you makin'? Rapunzel. (chuckles) - Thank you. - Looks like you. - She's locked in a tower. She's a prisoner. Kinda like us. - There's this preacher. He comes to the prison. And, um... (chuckles) He says we're all prisoners. One way or another. Some of our walls are real and some ain't. But there's somethin' that's holdin' all of us. Fear. Anger. Pride. Even dreams. - My daughter has nothing to say to you. (thunder rumbles) (Tad groans) (Tad groans) - I don't feel so good. What did you put in that food? - Nothing. - You liar, liar. Your pants are on fire. - You were out there in the kitchen with her when she was preparing it, weren't you, Tadly? - I just needed some of them antacids over there. - They don't work on rat poison. - You poisoned me? - She's playin' games with you, Tadly, god sakes. - Well, make her talk, then. - What'd you put in that chili, girl? - She said she didn't do anything. - Hey, was I talking to you? (sighs) (tense music) What'd you put in the chili, girl? (thunder claps) Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup. You got somethin' to say now? - Go ahead. I hate her anyway. (Simpson chuckles) - That one's gonna give you trouble. (workers yell over each other) (thunder claps) - I don't know, Cassie sounded, um, she sounded weird. Kinda sweet weird, you know? - Yeah, well, I would send a boat over to the house, but they're all workin' the storm. We got floodin' everywhere. - At the house? - [Donna] Well, definitely on the North Shore. - What about the old Pachitula Highway, is that above water? - Yes, it is. - [Wayne] Well, that'll get me within half a mile, then I can walk. - Look, Wayne, I know you need to do this, but uh, be careful, all right? - All right, thanks, Donna, I'll talk to you later. - [Donna] Yeah, okay. (Tad sighs) - You've been conned, brother. Your man is drinking whiskey at the cocktail lounge with your money, and your boat we're waitin' on? (laughs) - You're not gonna win. - [Tad] No, he's the big man with the plan. - [Cassie] A plan that's seriously flawed. - I got more than one plan, Cassandra, and none of them end very well for you. - I have to go to the bathroom. - [Simpson] Are you after my permission? Yes, retard, you may go to the bathroom. (engine hums) (tires screech) (phone keypad bleeps) - [Woman] We're sorry. All cellular lines are busy at the moment. Please try your call again later. - You have a scar, too. - So? - How'd you get it? - Neighbor's kid's dad beat on him. So, he beat on me and all the other kids with no dads. - You didn't have a father? - Came around every once in a while. - I'm sorry. We're movin' to Chicago. My dad's staying here. I'm gonna miss him. - You get used to it. - I won't. - How'd you get your scar? (melancholy music) - I was walking alone on the road. Got hit by a car. I was supposed to wait for my dad to pick me up, but he was late, so I walked home. I forgot everything. How to read, numbers. Stories I've known since... Forever. I've relearned most of it. I'm just not as good as I used to be. - I think you're just about perfect. - I like talking to you. (thunder claps) (engine roars) (Simpson groans) (Tad groans) Why do they call you Juke? (Juke chuckles) - 'Cause I know every song on the radio. - That's kind of amazing. (Juke chuckles) - I just like music. - No, (chuckles) it's really an amazing thing. - I think I gotta go again. (groans) - That's the chili talkin'. (chuckles) - When I get back, little girl, it's gonna be me and you! (groans) (coughs) (footsteps clack) (groans) (groans) I think somethin' crawled up in me and died! (groans) - [Juke] We better go back. - [Larry] Earle. - [Earle] Where the hell are you at now? - Where I'm at is in the same damn flow as you. - Let me talk to Simpson! - Well, he ain't here. And I got held up. And then he wasn't where he was supposed to be. He's holed up, out on the coastline. - [Earle] The rate this storm's comin' in, I can't guarantee I'll be here! - Oh, you just better believe you're gonna be there! I tell you what, man. - [Earle] Don't you threaten me, Larry. I ain't gonna get drowned for nobody! Come around three in the AM and I'm gone! - Damn it all to hell! Come on, Earle, that's just two hours from now! Hell, I can't even walk out there and back. Hello? Earle, Earle! Damn that guy! (knocks) - Got a little bit of a pileup tonight, huh? (chuckles) - [Larry] Oh, yes, sir. - You, uh, you lookin' for those escaped convicts? - Yeah, yeah. (tense music) - You wanna explain to me why my home address is on your pad there, huh? (dramatic music) (groans) (Larry laughs) Hey! (grunts) (grunts) (Larry groans) (groans) (thunder claps) (tense music) - Think you're so smart, don't you, little girl? What'd you put in the chili? - Hey, let go of her! - What'd you put in the chili? - Let go! (Tad chokes and gasps) (gun bangs) (Tad coughs) - Indoor voices, everybody, please? Go on, sit down, all y'all. (groans) Damn it, where's that idiot Larry at? Phone's out, someone forget to charge the phone? - Yeah, someone forgot! (suspenseful music) (thunder claps) (sighs) - Drugs. - What? - What kind of drugs you got in the house? - I might have a couple painkillers left over from Hayley's accident. - Thank you. (thunder claps) (thunder claps) - Put 'em back. (thunder claps) - Thank you, Cassandra. (engine hums) (thunder claps) (engine roars) - There ain't no boat gonna wait in this stuff. We need to get on the move. - Hand me my jacket. - Ain't no way to escape. They gonna be lookin' for us. - They gotta survive the ol' storm first. - What if you're wrong? - I ain't wrong. Now, sit down, you're making me nervous. - Okay, smarty pants. If, by some miracle, the storm ain't wiped out your boat, just where in the hell are we goin'? - You know what, Tadly, you're thinking too much, all right? You got smoke startin' to come out of your ears. Now be a good redneck and get off my couch. - [Tad] I'll be in the bathroom. - That one's gonna get you caught. (thunder claps) - Shut up. (rain splashes) (wind howls) (thunder claps) - Hey, sugar breeches. (laughs) (key clinks) - There's nothing of value in there. - I'll be the judge of that. Oh, lookie there. You got yourself a little shell necklace. Your husband kinda cheap, ain't he? Oh, lookie there. The newly weds. "I do, I do." (chuckles) Oh. I see here. What've we got here? Little somethin' with some leafs on it. Must be special. "My love. "I can't stand being away from you. "Every minute of every day and every night. "Last night when I was sleepy, "I woke up and felt you beside me. "I almost turned to see, but I didn't. "I wanted you there so much, I just closed my eyes and "went back to sleep. "Beside you. "Love always." I think I'm gonna puke. - "Love always," huh? (rain splashes) (thunder claps) (wind howls) (muffled clack) (thunder rumbles) (thunder claps) (rain splashes) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (Wayne grunts) (thunder claps) (Wayne grunts) (Wayne grunts) (distant groans) (footsteps approach) - [Tad] Son of a bitch. God. (lock clicks) (muffled wind howls) (muffled rain splashes) (thuds) Hey! The door's locked in the bathroom! Someone come help me! (thuds) Hey, hey, hey, hey! (thuds) Help! In the bathroom! (thuds) - Juke! - [Tad] Hey! I'm locked in here! (thuds) - Juke, get Tad out of the steamer! (thuds) - [Tad] Help! (door rattles) (suspenseful music) - Why, I do believe daddy's home. Hello! You have to the count of three! To come out! Hands high! Or I shoot your daughter and your wife. One! - You don't even know he's here. - Two! - [Wayne] Put the gun down. I said, put the gun down! (gun bangs) (groans) - Dad! Dad. (Wayne groans) - All right, help me roll him over. Okay, it's gone right through. (Wayne groans) Keep pressure on that! Bring me the first aid kit, please! - You're one demented son of a bitch. - Why, thank you. (thunder claps) (chuckles) What, did you have a little run in with the old fire chief over there? How's your head? Go on out and see if his car's outside. - [Cassie] Pads, we're gonna make a pressure bandage. Open those. - My my, Cassandra, you do have medical knowledge after all. - Yeah, it's coming back to me. Okay, get him back down, back down, back down. - Ain't no other car there. - Damn it. Damn it, where the hell's Larry at? Hey, Scarface. Go over there and get me a pillow. Run over there and get me a pillow, please. Make sure she don't hit you on the head while you're over there. (chuckles) Watch your head, Juke! (chuckles) (Hayley sobs) (thunder rumbles) (melancholy music) (Hayley sobs) - [Juke] I'm gonna get you outta here. - Okay. Roll. (Wayne groans) I know, I know, I know. (thunder rumbles) (moody electric guitar music) - Why, lookie there. (thunder claps) Hey. (women gasp) How would you like a scar like your little sister's? (thud) (coughs and screams) - Was he always like that? Feisty on his back? (chuckles) (Tad groans) (Wayne groans) - Ran into a prison guard who was up to no good. I think he was on his way out here. - Their ride. - Yeah. - What happened to him? (Wayne grunts) - Where's Hayley? - Oh, she's upstairs with the one they call Juke, getting pillows. - Oh, no. - [Cassie] What, what, what, what? What is it? - He's a convicted rapist. Yeah. (groans) - [Simpson] Where's the girl? - You and Tad was takin' stuff, so I took me some. - [Cassie] You son of a bitch! - Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! You don't wanna do this. (Cassie pants) (Wayne groans) - Tadly. Stand your little self up and go find the girl. - I'll be happy to. (Wayne groans) Hayley! (suspenseful music) It's Uncle Tad! Woo-hoo! Come out, come out, wherever you are! (chuckles) (thunder rumbles) Hey, sweet cheeks! You show me your scar... I'll show you mine! (thunder rumbles) Ain't no sign of the wounded chicken. - Juke. What did you do with the girl? - You ain't gotta worry about her no more. - No. - [Tad] Oh, my god. (thunder claps) Now, where in the hell have you been? - Bathroom. (Cassie sighs) - Hey, boy? (thunder claps) Don't forget who's got the gun. - Look who's holdin' the gun. Big man with the gun. If I had me a gun, I'd be a big man with a gun. (gun bangs) (screams) You shot me, you son of a bitch! (screams and sobs) Oh, god. - Man, how'd you get on work detail? - You see, in Hardyburgh Prison it just so happens, there are seven different Simpsons incarcerated there. - They're looking for the wrong guy. - Bingo. - Then what Simpson are you? - I'm the Simpson servin' two consecutive life sentences for murder. My wife. And her mother, to be exact. (groans) (groans) - I need some alcohol. Y'all got somethin' to drink here? Please! (groans) (dramatic music) (grunts) (groans) (thud) (Simpson screams) (thud) (groans) (gun bangs) (women scream) - Damn, man, he's dead! - You're not gonna get away with this. You're gonna die here or you're gonna go back to prison, and die there! - I'm not the one who's gonna be dyin' tonight! (glass smashes) - Your ride isn't showin'. Your only hope of gettin' outta here is goin' to the neighbors', gettin' their car, go to the marina. Bunch of boats you can steal there. - Ah, shut up, shut up! Shut up! (groans) (glass smashes) Tie 'em up. (Cassie gasps) - What did you do to my daughter? I know you're a rapist. - I didn't rape nobody. - You were in prison for rape. - She was white, I'm black. Her daddy's rich, I'm not, get the picture? - Leave the older one free. When we go, she's coming with us. - No, take me. - [Simpson] Shut up. - I'll be okay. - [Cassie] No. Nicole, stop. (Nicole yelps) Nicole, stop! - Nick! Come on. Come here. Nicole. I'm cold. - [Cassie] Hayley, go get those blankets. - Scarface. Bring me those blankets. - My daddy needs them. - I said, bring me those blankets. - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Listen, give me one of those to give to Simpson, and you give the other one to your daddy. - No, no, bring me the blankets! I said, I want the god damn blankets over here! (gun cocks) - What you gonna do, Simpson, huh? You gonna shoot me like you shot everybody else in the room? Then who's gonna carry you outta here, huh? And what you gonna use for bullets if the cops show up? (Simpson chuckles) (thunder rumbles) (Simpson chuckles) - You not as stupid as you appear, Juke. - No, I'm pretty dumb. But I'm pretty tired of all this, too. (Simpson chuckles) (thunder claps) - It doesn't matter, 'cause you're all dead anyway. (tense music) Pew. (Cassie gasps) (somber music) - Thank you, sweetheart. - I am so sorry. This is all my fault. - It's not your fault. - Yes, it is. - It's not your fault. - Stop it, it doesn't matter anymore. You blame Daddy, he blames you. Nicole blames me. I could've waited for Daddy and I didn't. That's why I got hit by that car. - You didn't do anything wrong. - I did. I made a mistake! I made a mistake. (footsteps clack) - [Simpson] Juke. Juke! - [Juke] What? - [Simpson] Get the girl. Get the stuff. Go on outside for a minute. (thunder claps) - It's not the end, come here. Stay strong, stay strong, do you hear me? Stay strong. - He didn't tie me up. - Okay, this is our chance, all right? You grab the girls and you get outta here, and don't look back. - Why, what're you gonna do? - [Wayne] I'm gonna stop him from following you. - No, he'll kill you! - He's only got a couple bullets. I don't think Juke's gonna go along with this. - [Cassie] No, no. - No, don't argue with this. This is our last chance to save the girls. - I love you. - (chuckles) I know. (dramatic music) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (gun bangs) (thunder claps) (groans) - Upstairs! (screams) (pan thuds) (Simpson groans) Come on, come on. (Wayne groans) (Cassie pants) - Oh, you never listen. - I liked my plan better. - Your plan was better, but that Juke guy took a bullet in the side for me. - He let me go, he told me to run to the neighbors, but I couldn't leave without... (ominous music) (ax thuds) (women scream) - Help me move this! Get it in front of the door! Put your weight against it! (ax thuds) Get me that hairspray can! (dramatic music) (ax thuds) (flames roar) (Simpson screams) (thud) (Simpson groans) (Simpson screams) (thunder claps) (eerie music) (Cassie pants) Go get the kit. (Juke groans) - Is he gonna be okay? - He'll live. - I deserve worse. - No. No, you don't. Thank you. - Listen. (birds tweet) Wow. - Daddy, look. (somber music) - Cassie? Hey, Wayne! Are y'all all right? - Mom? Daddy? - Cassie? Wayne! Gals? Is everything okay? - Guys, this is not a trick question. - Are we okay? - Yeah. I think we're gonna be fine.
