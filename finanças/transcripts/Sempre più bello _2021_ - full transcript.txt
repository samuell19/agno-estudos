NETFLIX PRESENTS Silence in the court! Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Say, "I swear." I swear. Miss Marta, where were you yesterday between the hours of five and six in the afternoon, when someone threw a stone against the window of the science classroom? Your Honour, as always, I was sitting at home. I was watching the new episode of High School Musical. You can prove it? Sure. The episode showed Troy kissing Gabriela. Objection, Your Honour. Troy kisses Gabriela in every episode, and the plot is on the TV Guide. Sustained. One guesses you have some witnesses to bring forward? Well, yes. My grandma. Tell me, why can't we call her to testify? Because she is a very, very unpleasant woman, Your Honour. Marta. Marta, how many times have I told you that you're not to rummage in my closet, huh? Sorry, Grandma. We were just playing. We'll put everything back in place. And you two, go home. Immediately. It's late. Bye. - Bye. - See ya. GENERAL SURGERY, PULMONOLOGY WAITING ROOM Guys, everything's all right for now. - Meaning? - What does that mean? The surgery couldn't have gone better for her. I want to see her. To begin with, in my house, we always say "please". - And who the hell are you, anyway? - Gabriele. Gabriele De Marchi. Oh, right. We were about to call you. - Me? - Yes. Normally we ask the patient to indicate the name of one family member who can visit, even if it is for a short time. And... Marta told me she has no relatives and asked me to enter your name. - Yes. - Follow me. We'll keep her sedated for now. We'll awaken her little by little. She'll have to stay here for two weeks. And afterwards, if everything goes smoothly, she'll spend a couple of days in intensive care and then be moved to the ward. Will she be okay? She's just undergone a very important surgery... but Marta is a tiger in the body of a hamster. She'll be fine. You can stay here behind the glass for ten minutes a day. Your time is up for today. Can I just have two more minutes alone with her, please? I beg you. - All right. - Thank you. I'm sorry. Your two minutes are up. Leave it. I'll finish here. Thank you. I'm exhausted. Tomorrow I have to be in the office for eight. Well, if going in is such an issue, why don't you quit? I can't quit just because I don't want to wake up in the morning. Or because... I couldn't care less about computer systems, and just seeing a line of code just makes me want to throw up. - No, you're right. - Ugh. That's where her last lab tests were. Well, she doesn't need them any more. Tomorrow I'll bring them to the hospital, just to be sure. Will you bring them to Dario? Well, about Dario. Do you think he has a boyfriend? I don't know. The constant use of Drool at work? Even if he has a boyfriend, I smell a crisis. Hmm? I'm going. Siria, search for "Doctor Dario Caponi". Okay. Here's what I found about Dario Caponi, doctor. C'mon. We're about to wake her up. Come with me. Hi. Hi. I'll show you. Good. Perfect. Here. So, she won't come home for another three weeks. No. Anyway, guys, three weeks are already a miracle. This phase is extremely delicate. However, the good news is, now that she has new lungs, she won't need all the tubes. Mm. How did she react when she saw you? She was not surprised at all. She always knew that I would be there for her. Sure, if someone hadn't forgotten to warn me that the hospital had changed... I'm always the first to say I can't be trusted. That's true. He's always saying that. Anyway, I'll stay at the hospital until she comes out, and I can notify you via our chat if there are any changes. But what about your work? - I quit. - Really? Yes. But I thought you liked Paris and production design. Yes. For now, let's say I have more pressing priorities. Anyway, here in Turin, there's a private high school looking for art history teachers, so, I'll start from there. You don't lack determination, eh? I could do with some myself. Hmm? Nothing. Excuse me, but I'm going to bed. Tomorrow I have to go to the office again. Good night. But a coffee this late? No, a decaf. Listen up. Thank you for everything you're doing for Marta. Please, it's nothing. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. And I like this new doctor. He looks like someone you can trust. Mm-hmm. Marta's in good hands. Such good hands. Hmm? Hmm? Hmm. Hmm. - These documents must all be checked. - All right. - Good morning. - Fede, thank goodness you're here. What's up? They tried to hack the railway website firewall again. I think we're working till late today. What's wrong? I quit. You can't. Yes, I can. Make my notice effective immediately. But why? Because every time I walk in here, I feel like I'm trapped. Have we done anything wrong? No. No. You and Cristina have nothing to do with it. You were born for this work. You've worked hard to get where you are. And I can see a mile away that you're happy. I'm not. It's just fair that this job goes to someone who really appreciates it. You've had enough of early mornings, haven't you? Yes. Yes! Guys. Please, you're making me scared. - What else happened, then? - Nothing. We're just happy to see you again. And I you. I'm so glad you all came to see me. And I'm already feeling better. I'll be discharged in a few days. How cute are the two of you? Your speech at the party has left even me without words. Yes, you and 20 million other followers. Ah, speaking of followers. How many have you lost because of me? Well, actually, they've gone up by 9.3%. No thanks to you. Tonight he'll meet my parents for the first time. There'll be carnage, you know. Guys, time is up. Everyone out. Marta, how are you feeling? I'm fine. Doctor, do we know who the donor was? We do not know. A very generous person, indeed. Marta, take care of their lungs. Ten minutes. Thank you. Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Hi there. Marta, I'm... If you feel like a big, fat idiot for doubting me, for accusing me so unjustly, and for going to the wrong hospital... ...don't worry. I forgive you. Well, to be fair, the last thing was because of Jacopo. I'm sorry. I went too far with the situation regarding Tommaso... Shh. Let's not talk about that any more, hmm? Okay. Marta, I... I love you too, my dear. Okay. Let's review the rules. So, no... Quotes from Lord of the Rings. - I speak little. - That's right. I mean, no. You don't speak. You just answer when spoken to, and with monosyllables. - Uh-huh. - Then? I can't drink. I can't dance. I have to pretend to like your father's meat loaf, even when he's burnt it. Perfect. I mean, the ring is nothing... nothing but an allegory, and the idea of a power too great for mankind. Exactly. In the period in which the atomic bomb was being built. - Mm, true. - Mm-hmm. I know I'm going... How can I put it? Against the tide, but I've always found The Hobbit more engaging. - Of course. I agree with you, Giacomo. - Me too. What did we say? - Excuse me. - Mm. Paolo, would you pass me another piece of meat loaf? It is... ...spectacular. You're an expert. Here. - Thank you. - My precious. Thank you. One for you. Giacomo, what a pleasure. Come back whenever you want. I'd love to, Marghi. Oh, next time I'll bring you that Tolkien comic book I was telling you about. - I'll count on it. - I've got some meat loaf for you. Here. - Ah, yes, the meat loaf. - Thank you. Shall we go now? Bye, then. I really like this one. Not like the foreign singer last time. - Mm-hmm. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. What do you think? Do you think it went well? It was brilliant. Hello. Hey. What are you still doing here? Do you not have a life? What am I still doing here? I'm basically your brother. I want to make sure that you're fine. Oh. Mm, but... where's Dario? He's already done his rounds. He's already done his rounds. Jacopo, don't tell me you're in love. Please. No way. It's just that I still have to be rejected by a doctor. - For my résumé. - Oh. Listen up. Why have you told the hospital you no longer have living relatives? Because it's true. Oh God. Is the old lady dead? I didn't know. For me, she is, and you know it. I see. You're still holding a grudge. Yes, I still am. Hey, Marta. Great news. You'll go home earlier. I'll discharge you tomorrow. Already? No. I mean, yeah! Easy, easy. So? How do those new lungs feel? I feel, uh, like I'm drunk on oxygen. Whoo! - Oh! Easy. Easy. - Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't be. What do you say if I drive you? Ah, yes. Maybe you're right. Where do you want to go first? Mm... HOSPITAL Hey. I didn't know when or even if I would come back here someday. I feel extremely fortunate. We are both very fortunate. Where's our next stop? Today is a special day. You see that girl there, standing near aisle six? She's the voice who's always announced the special offers. Well, today... ...she is back. Welcome back. Well done. So, to celebrate, the whole deli counter has 90% off. EXIT Okay. Third stop? - ♪ Get in and drive ♪ - As you command, my captain. Mm. Now I'm truly at home. Mm. Let me set the alarm. But why? I'm still on sick leave. Not me, though. Tomorrow I have to teach my first class. For the past three days, I've been worrying about arriving late and not remembering anything. Oh, come on. You'll be brilliant tomorrow. - You think? - Mm-hmm. It will be like in a film. "Professor De Marchi, I've been very naughty." "I didn't do my homework." "Professor De Marchi, don't send me to the principal." What movies do you watch? Mm, well, let me show you. - Mm. - Mm. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Professor De Marchi. No, please, just, uh, call me Gabriele. Ah. Well, let's start... He's cute. ...by talking about the Pre-Raphaelites. So, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was an artistic association influential for Victorian painting, born in September 1848, which was developed but also finished then, in Great Britain, in some respects... Um, um... It's similar both to the Symbolism Movement but also Art Nouveau, and it can be defined as the pictorial transposition of the Late Romantic era. So romantic. Yeah. - Isn't he hot? - Yes. Everything's fine, Marta. Just a recommendation. The lungs are new but, uh, the gene of the disease, that's still there. Hmm? So you have to be very careful. I will, Doctor. And you'll no longer need to come back once a week. See you in a month. - All right. - All right? - See you soon. - See you soon. Fuck, one month. Oh, I've forgotten the prescription for the enzymes. Okay, I'll go. Come in. Um... excuse me, Doctor. Uh, Marta has finished the enzymes. Can you give us a new prescription, hmm? Forgive me, but I don't have much time. I'll take you to dinner in three days. It's your birthday, isn't it? Are you surprised? You're not the only one to have Internet. Now, go. I have a hell of a day ahead. Whoa. We'll miss you, arsehole. If you change your mind, I'll bin your resignation. Don't worry, I won't. But I will miss you guys too. It's not like I'm dying. We can still hang out together, eh? We will always be the four queens. Who's this? Ah. Speak of the devil. Hello, Federica. Silvia has told me about your resignation. I just wanted to tell you that, in my opinion, this is a huge cock-up. Mm-hmm. But it is also a very familiar case that the bigger the cock-up, the funnier they are. So, good luck. And don't you be a stranger, my dear. Understood? Yes. Isn't it super romantic, what's happening between Giacomo and Rebecca? Yes, a lot. Even if they are grabbing the spotlight away from us. Well, let's fix that right now. Marta, my love. Yes? You know, now that the situation is a little more relaxed and I've found a job and you are better lately, how about... Yeah? ...getting a place only for us? Oh my God, are you nuts? I thought you were asking me to marry you. Oh my God. Sorry, no. But do you? Not at all. No way! - You? - Well, absolutely not. Well, "absolutely not" seems a bit harsh to me. Does it not? Maybe one day. I think it's a bit early to talk about that right now, don't you think? Gabriele. I'm just pulling your leg. Why don't you... You really are the worst. Of course we can go and live together. But telling Jacopo and Federica is on you. Complete coward. What's on who? I just remembered that I have to write to the principal. - I'll be right back. - You coward. - Sorry! - Ouch! What is this rubbish? I quit my job. - Oh. - Ah. Finally. You should tell me I made a massive cock-up, not to be happy. So irresponsible. What will you do now? Will you go back to fleecing the countess? No. I'll enjoy my well-deserved unemployment for now. Mm. Guys... ...I too have something to say. Gabriele and I are going to live together. - Oh. At last. - Well! Aren't you angry? Well, no. Why on earth should we be? Sooner or later, it had to happen. Anyway, it won't last. Living together is the death of romanticism. A week from now, you'll be back on your knees, begging us to move back in. Stop it. It will be beautiful. - And you're going to have your own place. - Yes. Give us the time to sort things out, and we'll leave you your love nest. Right, we'll get a beautiful, two-room apartment in the banlieues, and I'll get tetanus. No, guys. No way. The house is yours and always will be. No. We couldn't stay here. This was your parents' house. I know, but it's too big a house, and we won't know how to use all these rooms, just the two of us. And I came up with an idea to make some money out of it. Not a pay-by-the-hour hotel? Almost. We open a B and B. - And we share the profits. - Per head, two euros. No, considering that we're in a super central area and that during the film festival, prices skyrocket. Well, assuming you occupy it for 20 days a month, the figure we're looking at could be this. Huh. - You're hired. - Mm-hmm. When do you leave? Stop, stop! No! No! No! Ah! Enough! These new lungs have made you a bit of a bruiser. - It's gonna be your birthday soon. - What are we going to do? Nothing. I mean, 21 is a stupid number. There's nothing to celebrate. Okay, I have a date with Doctor Caponi. You mean my Doctor Caponi? You mean The Shit? Yes. I want to be Mrs. Shit. Oi! - Morning. - Morning. - Good morning. Morning. - Morning. - This way, please. - Thank you. Ah, this is it. It has an energy. It's perfect. Can we take it? Yes. How much is the rent? 1,500 plus expenses, three months' rent as a deposit, plus agency costs. Mm. I think we'll get tired of all this energy in the long run. - I agree. - Mm. - Maybe there's too much, mm... - Light. Hmm. I also feel it's a bit humid. - Damp! Mm-hmm. - Damp! Yes. - Yes. - Yes. "I could suggest to you this cottage, facing the motorway, next to the dump." "Just don't open the windows." Come on. Just have a little patience. You'll see. We'll find the right one. And we must change the real estate agency. Yes, please. Anyway, this house isn't that bad. Mm. Jacopo! Turn the volume down! I was sleeping! First date with The Shit. This one? Or this one, huh? Whatever. As long as you turn down that music. - Wear that one. It's a little more... - Hmm? A little more. Okay. Thanks, guys. Welcome. I'm almost reconsidering the house on the dump. Well, happy birthday. What's wrong? Mm, nothing. It's just that I'm not used to this. - It feels strange. - What do you mean? Don't tell me I'm your first. Yeah, right. First? Just, no. No, you're not my first. No. But still, you are my friend's doctor, after all. And I thank her for having introduced a nice guy like you to me. And I thank the National Health Service for letting you have the chance to cure her. Speaking of Marta, you look very close with the other girl too. - Federica. - Mm. We're basically a family. What about your real family? Oh, my real family. My mother... collects more husbands than shoes. And you should see her shoe rack. Right now she's... in India. Hmm. You reminded me that I haven't heard from her in three months. And I'm not that close with, uh, my father. Am I wrong, or do you often hide behind a joke? No, you're not wrong. - Everyone has a defence mechanism. - Of course. But sometimes when you pull up a wall that's too high, it becomes a prison. Just so I understand, pulmonologist or psychologist? Another joke. Jacopo, don't worry. You're perfect as you are. Jacopo! Hello. You're here too? Dario, this is Rebecca. This is Giacomo. You met at the hospital, uh, remember? Of course. Hi, Giacomo. How are you? Very well, thanks. Very well. Enjoy your evening, guys. We'll go now. Hmm? - You too. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. Well, nice dinner. And now? What's the plan? Yes, he was as brilliant as he was misunderstood, you see. Guys, we can also say he was despised while he lived. In fact, Van Gogh remarkably influenced the art movement of the 20th century... I found a house for us! It's the perfect one, and I've made an appointment to see it today during lunch! Yes. Thing is, I'm kind of teaching a class. Ah. Hello. Well, um, guys. This is Marta, my girlfriend. - No. - No way. Please! I know. I'm so sorry. In that case, see you later, then. Mm. Mm, yes, um... - Okay. - As you were. Well, we were saying... Van Gogh. - Are your eyes closed? - Of course. - Don't open them. - I won't. Okay. Stop here. Now you can open them. So, imagine a big desk here because there's a window, and a lot of light comes in, so you can draw. And then, I thought we could put the sofa over here. And on these walls, we could have our photos. What do you think? It's perfect. Yeah. The price is perfect too. Hmm. You can come to the agency to sign the contract tomorrow. The landlady asks for two months' early payments. And out of sheer formality, tenants under 30 must have a guarantor. Um, that's not just a formality. Well, we both have a pay cheque, so... Yes, I've seen them. But, unfortunately, they are not enough. I'm sorry. We just can't compromise in this respect. We need a guarantor. Possibly a family member. Well, do you know what this means? That it's finally time for our families to meet. Ah, finally, we get to meet one. Meaning? Can you believe you're the first girl Gabriele has brought home to us? At first, we were all convinced that he was gay. Right, guys? For his 20th birthday, we gave him a trip to London as a gift. Including a backstage pass for Gay Pride. But nothing. Too bad, huh? 'Cause I believe that at least one gay child for a mother can sometimes be a blessing, you know? But I haven't lost hope. Sincerely, believe me, Gabriele is not gay at all. Oh, you poor thing! Because if he's anything like his father, you must be finished! Guys, nothin'. They say that Ayurvedic massage courses and direct cultivation of hemp are not a... not a sufficient guarantee of income. Have you told them it's therapeutic? Of course I've told 'em. And they didn't fall for it? No, but we have to do something. Come on, guys. Cheer up. It's not that bad, huh? Huh? And worst case, we take care of you. - Yeah. - Oh yeah! That's good. I would ask my parents, but I don't think they accept guarantors from the afterlife. Aw, here. Mm. No, Mum. She can't. Come on. Okay. Let's get the dessert. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Grab that. But why don't you ask your grandmother? Oh, you're stupid! What? Easy. Wait, do you remember Carolina, my ex? - Which one of the many? - Don't start again. Carolina, who worked in a bank. Maybe I can ask her if the bank can act as your guarantor. - Huh? - Yeah. Mm. - I finally have some good news for you. - Are you ready for an encore? Hmm, so I have two pieces of good news. Mm! - Spill it. - Okay. So... the agency called. It's okay to have a bank guarantee. Tomorrow I'm going to take the keys. Good. What's wrong? Well, nothing. It's just that this is an important step. To leave Jacopo and Federica. You know, they're my family. Now, what's wrong with you. Hey? It's just that... I've heard you talk about a grandmother. I thought she passed away some time ago. No, not technically. When my parents died, I was given into her custody. Let's just say she wasn't very happy to take on a granddaughter, and she showed it every day. When was the last time you saw her? Well, as soon as I turned 18, I moved out of her house. Seeing you and your family together was very nice, you know. You can't imagine how much I'd love to have had something like that. Yes, but you've had Jacopo and Federica. In the end, the real family is the one you choose, right? Yes, I know. I'm very fortunate. Yes. But certain voids just can't be filled, hmm? - Good night. - Good night. So, how are we doing? Very well, thanks. How are you doing? Uh, excuse me. Are you now making jokes? Very well. I wonder who is giving you lessons. I've got a question that's been spinning in my head for a while. Why do you call it mucoviscidosis? It's been called cystic fibrosis for 30 years now. Because it's a funny name, so it's less scary for me, hmm. Get dressed. - Doctor? - Hmm? I'm not usually nosy... I can imagine what a superhuman effort you're making right now. But let's face it, Jacopo is like a brother, you know? So, you're a sort of brother-in-law, aren't you? As you know, that only works in films. And technically, Jacopo is just a friend to you, and for me too, hmm? Yeah, sure. Have you found something? Well, just look at the clues, mate. Yeah, well, I know. You start there, and I'll follow you. Don't tell me what to do. You're always trying to tell me what to do. Wait a minute, mate. Just calm down. We're gonna get through this together. We're a team. Now you're telling me. I do not know what you want. NOEMI: THANKS FOR COMING TO MY PARTY. YOU SAVED THE DAY! THANKS FOR THE GIFT. I REALLY LIKED THE BOOK! I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMPLICATED NOW! WE AREN'T ALL LIKE REBECCA. COME OVER. LET'S TALK. Impossible. I feel like I'm in an episode of Black Mirror. Without all that rubbish, it looks ten times bigger. You know that, if you want, you can sleep here tonight. Right. You don't have to leave right away. Do you? Guys, but if I don't do it now, I'll never go away. I'm almost sad that I still can't lift heavy weights. Don't worry. This was the last one. Thank you. - Hmm. - No, no, no. Wait, wait. Let's do things right. Et voilà. Wow. Well, I think we're nearly there. Oh yeah. I think we're there. I can't wait for the new bed to arrive. Mm, yes. I forgot to take the enzymes. Can you pick them up from the kitchen, please? I beg you. As you command. Mm, thank you. They're in the box on the right. GRANDMA - MARTA SCHOOL REPORT ADDRESS: CORSO FRANCIA 297/1 Madam? Hello? I'm... I'm Gabriele. I'm your granddaughter's boyfriend. Marta. Madam? Listen, I can hear that you're behind the door right now. Madam, please. I just want to talk about your granddaughter. Please, I want to know. I understand what you want, but I'm afraid this is trespassing. I've already called the police. No, please! Please. Your granddaughter has explained to me that your relationship has cooled, but this doesn't mean that... What a massive bitch. Come on. Move the bed over a bit to hide that stain. Open the curtains. Okay. Okay. - Great. - It's online. Money, money. No. No. No! Hi. We're Asia and Zoe. Nice to meet you. Zoe, say hi. Say hi. Aw. Do you want to hold her a minute? - Yeah. - Come on. - How cute. - Hey. Hello! Hi. Isn't she just? - Mummy! - She likes you, eh? Yeah. - Do you have children? - No. - No, but we love kids. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Surprise! Oh my God. Hiya. Hello. Hmph. So, that's where your keys were hiding. You can't come and go as you like. This house is not a hotel. Well, actually... But what's her name? It's Zoe! The most beautiful girl in the world. She looks like a doll. She never cries. She just wants to play and cuddle. - Exactly like me. - Mm-hmm. Guys, we're not going down that road. I have other priorities. Tonight he's out with his love doctor. Ooh. Ah. Good. It's just that, Jacopo, I don't think he's the right person for you at all. He looks a bit reserved. - You know, a bit unaccessible. - It's part of his charm. And he's not unaccessible when he's with me. His defences are slowly falling down. Okay, um, how long have you been going out together exactly? I correct you, my dear. We are a couple from exactly one month today. Thirty days. Actually, and tonight, I'll give him this. What is it? - Uh, nothing much. - Jacopo! Okay, if you must. It's a weekend in the mountains in a five-star hotel with spa. Are you crazy? Why not? It's romantic. Even though to pay for it, I had to sell a lung. Oops. - How do I look? - Great. Let me know if you're sleeping out. Then I'll let you know now. I will. Although, I doubt we will sleep much. Jacopo. - Coffee? - Yeah, sure. - So, a child has arrived in the house. - Yes, but they leave tomorrow. I'll miss little Zoe. Try this. Mm, so good. Do you know what I would like? Can we eat first? I'm serious. Picture the scene. A mountain spa, you and I getting body massages all day. Face treatments, mud baths, then maybe a dip in the heated outdoor pool. And then... I'm sorry. I didn't silence it. Don't worry. It's not a matter of etiquette. What do you mean? Are you still on Drool? Oh, that? Jacopo, I like you a lot. You know that. But how long have we been going out? A month? I don't know. I didn't count the days. Let's not rush things, please. We'll feel it when it's the right time. And then there'll be no more people for the both of us. Don't tell me I'm the only one you're going out with. Of course not. Actually, I remembered I have a date with fucker97. I'll get a gin and tonic. THE SHIT: SORRY YOU GOT UPSET. SEE YOU LATER SO I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I mean, we're booked up for three months. Super. Wait. Weren't you staying out last night? Something wrong? No, you were right. We were moving too fast. We've decided to take it easy and start going out with other people. Mm. How long has she been crying like that? Quite a while, actually. Where's Asia? Asia? Hello? Everything all right? Asia? - Open up. - I'm going in. Hey. "I'll be back in a few days." What the fuck do we do now? I'll call the police. No, wait. What if they put her in an orphanage? What if Asia comes back in a couple of days and doesn't find her? No, no, no. We can't do that. - Okay. What do you suggest we do, then? - I don't know! Okay, come on. Okay. Asia said she'll be back in a couple of days, right? Let's wait until Thursday, and then we'll see. - What's wrong with her? - I don't know. - Maybe she's hungry. - What does she eat? Maybe it's written on there. Asia had that food processor. Here it is. What now? - Like that. - Like that. ♪ When I'm lyin' in my bed at night... ♪ - Like that? No? - No. - You haven't closed it. - It's not working. Ah! ♪ How do you move in a world of fog... ♪ Oh, good! - Want to eat? - Good. ♪ A dog ♪ ♪ When I see the price that you pay... ♪ Come on, baby. Zoe, it's okay. Ready. Good girl. ♪ Seems that folks turn into things ♪ ♪ That they never want ♪ ♪ The only thing to live for is... ♪ Huh? ♪ Want to grow up ♪ Guys, is everything okay? Marta, we've ended up in a horrible '80s movie. - Asia left us her baby. - Left her? In what way? In the only way possible. This morning we entered the room, and she was alone. But she said she'll be back in a couple of days. She will, right? Look, we only have about 28 minutes before the next meal, and we need to find the nappies. - Food for the baby. - And formula. - And that thing for their teeth. - Yeah. I already know it. We are going to kill that poor baby. Guys, you're scaring me now. When she's so calm, she's adorable. Anyway, guys, you're nuts. What if her mum doesn't come back? We are well aware that we can't just keep her. Let's just enjoy this moment. Well, "enjoy". Ah. We have news. Jacopo is in an open relationship. Oh my God. Such a big mouth! Where are you going? I have a date with Dario. Hmm. Will there be many others? No, my dear. You can't go out whenever and leave me alone with the baby. What are you going to do when we have our own kids? Go out every night, leaving me alone? Every night? It's just one. No way. Now make yourself useful and warm up the bottle. Are you being serious? - I... - Guys, guys, guys. You're scaring me. You look like a couple of stressed-out parents on the verge. And he's the irresponsible one. - She's a pain in the arse! - Shh. Okay, now. Aunt Marta will take care of everything. Jacopo, you go out with Dario and his friends. Federica, don't worry. Rest, take a shower. Aunt Marta will take care of little Zoe, hmm? Do you want to take a walk with me? Huh, little one? What about Gabriele? Don't you have to go home? No, he has a staff meeting. He'll come home late, poor thing. Look, I know you're in the house. Please don't call the police. Madam, I'm only asking for five minutes. And then, I promise you that if you haven't changed your mind, I will disappear from your life for good. Same for your granddaughter, Marta. Please. I beg your pardon? You've asked for five minutes. Time flies, young man. Yes, um... Well... Marta and I have been together for a few months now, and we love each other very much, um... Unfortunately, she has a very serious illness, but I guess you already know that. So, some time ago, there was... a complication, but she is well. She has undergone the lung transplant. We recently have started to live together. Look... ...I don't mean to be nosy, but... But you're the only family she has left. I don't know what happened that's so serious between the two of you. But maybe there can be a way to reconcile, to talk again, make things better. Why did Marta send you here, hey? Of course. Marta has no idea you're here, does she? Right? No, she doesn't know. But... But I'm sure she misses you so much. Yes, young man. You really did behave like a real snoop, you know? You thought you could fix a relationship between two people, even though those two people didn't feel the slightest need that it should be fixed. You have to explain to me, who the hell do you think you are? Ma'am, wait. I beg you. Marta needs you. And even if she doesn't realise it, I do. And I'm sure it would be good for you to know that girl because if she is so wonderful, full of life, and generous, it's also thanks to you. Just leave. All right. I apologise for the intrusion. If you perhaps change your mind, this is my number. Goodbye. I don't understand why we're here. Oh, excuse me. It's a patient. So, since it's your turn to choose, what should we watch? I've been undecided between Infidelity and Pigs Can Fly. Next. Two tickets, please. Who was that? Who was who? The guy you just nodded to. I haven't nodded. He smiled at me, and I smiled back. - Look, Jacopo, what's wrong? - Nothing. I'm sorry. I just feel guilty for having left Federica alone with Zoe, that's all. - Thank you. - Next. Theatre two, thank you. He pays. ♪ Come on, we're going for a pram ride ♪ ♪ Broom, broom, broom, broom ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh, what a cutie. She's a beauty. How old is she? - I don't have the slightest idea. - What? Uh, it's a joke. Have a good day. Let's go. Say hi. Okay, look at me now. - Okay. - Oh. - Let's take five. - Lovely. Have you forgotten to tell us something? Oh, I wish. It's your cousin and Jacopo's. Excuse me? Uh, no, I mean they're, uh, taking care of her for her real mother. Ah. - Okay. - Okay. Does she want to come here? - Sure. Do you want to go? - Come here. - Bye. Wow! - Aw. Beautiful dress. Hello. No. Uh... Uh... Uh, try, uh, to bring her head a little higher. - Mm. - Sorry. Can I? Mm. Aw. There she is. Hey, Zoe. No, no. Aw. Here's little Zoe. No. Give her back. Look, it must be a coincidence. You are a real troublemaker, huh? Just like someone I know. Now we have to take you back to Jacopo and Federica, but I know I'm the one you prefer. It's all right. Everything's all right. All right. It was just... It was simply just a cough. It happens, no? A stupid, simple cough. THE SHIT Don't cry. Ah. Hello? It's Becca. Becca, hey. How's Giacomo? I haven't heard from him since Monday. He's in the shower now. Can you explain to me this sudden love for Giacomo? Uh, nothing. I've been a jerk. Actually, he's a pretty cool guy. Coincidentally, only since we've been together, hmm? What does that have to do with it? Look, can you just tell him to call me back? Becca? Hello? Becca, answer me. I've created a monster. And the only solution... Hmm. Is to destroy him. Good. No! What's wrong? Look how afraid he is. You want a punch, you shit? Come on, you pussy. Punch me. Yeah, come here. Guys. He's peed himself. Ugh! He's peed himself. He has! - Oh. - Oh, God. - Oh, disgusting. - What a freak. Oh, what a show! POST VIDEO YES, NO VIDEO POSTED PISS POT! PEEPEE POTTER Lord of the Rings is not gonna save you now. Oh, guys, he's actually peed himself. - Ah. Oh! - That is gross. It's actually disgusting. You make me sick. #PISSPOT LOSER No. Come on. Who... Who would pull such a horrible stunt? Someone who doesn't even have the courage to show their name. It's a fake profile. Arseholes. Poor Giacomo. Um, can you check the bottle? Sure. Hey. Have you heard from Marta? - No, you? - No, not since last night. Ah, 12 hours without messages. She's already forgotten us. Stupid, I'm being serious. I don't know why, but I have a bad feeling. I'll call her. Marta? Open up! Look, we already know you're home. But... - Hello. - You really worried us. Is everything all right? You called me 35,000 times in less than 24 hours. - Don't you think it's a bit much? - No. Well, I think it's time to loosen things up a little bit. I'm trying to build myself a life with Gabriele. I don't think it's healthy to be together quite this much. I think it's finally time to cut the umbilical cord. What do you mean? Meaning that maybe we should just be friends and not... and not some kind of strange, obsessive family. - Hmm. - Hmm. I think it's better for everyone. Hmm? Mm. - How's the baby? - She's finally sleeping. Do you believe this "umbilical cord" bullshit? No way. It's the same old story. She has a problem, and instead of asking us for help, she shuts up like a clam. So? What can we do? What we've always done. Be the pain in the arse. We're there for her, even if she doesn't want it. And we're watchful. Have you heard the baby before? She said, "Dad". She said, "din-din". She was famished. She said, "Dad". Don't ruin this moment for me. Don't you get too attached. - Hey. - Hi. - You're late. - Yes. I've had a staff meeting. Ugh. Today too? No, actually. It was only today. Listen, I have to tell you something. You cheated on me. No. If that was the case, you would have never told me, you pig. No, uh... I... I visited your grandmother. Please don't get upset. I've only done it because I thought that you missed her so much. You shouldn't have done it. I'm not angry. I know what you must be thinking. You, with your movie-like family. You don't understand that there are just some situations that just can't be fixed. Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. But you did. Even if it was for a good cause. I bet she didn't want to talk. Well, actually, she also called the police. Typical Grandma. But you could have told me. I would have saved you the trouble. Sorry to ask, but... what happened between you two? Don't answer me if you don't want to. Don't worry. When my mother died, the two of them hadn't been talking for eight years. I met her when the social workers brought me to her. Ironically, she had never had interest in meeting me, and suddenly she found herself with a granddaughter. And a sick one too. I think she did her best. But, trust me, she has done more damage than muco. We were always arguing. We also argued on my 18th birthday. I told her that the wrong mother had died in that accident. She slapped me. And that was it. End of my family. No. No. She may be your grandmother... ...but I am your family. Hmm? You're burning up. Are you sick? What should we do? Take me to the hospital. Yes. - Aww. - Peek... Peekaboo! - Who is it? Marta? - No, it's impossible. Guys, I'm back! Hey! Ah. Hey, sweetie. Mummy's back now. Hi. Mm! Oh, hi. Oh! Where have you been exactly? We were about to call the police. Um, I know. I'm sorry, but I had to find Ludovico. Hello. I... I'm Ludovico, Zoe's father. We met each other the very first time I was here, and he did not know that we'd had an adorable baby girl. Which is why I couldn't take her with me today. No, it was better to leave her with two complete strangers. But everything went well, though. She's beautiful. She's so beautiful. You're so beautiful. No, you are. Um, I think we should go now. Hmm? - Hey. - Hey. Sweetie, hi. Zoe, say bye to Federica and Jacopo, hey? - Bye, little one. - Ah. Be a good girl, won't you? And so, what will you do now? We'll make this work. I have something to do. Hi. What are you doing here? Come in. You could have warned me. Are you staying for dinner? No. Ah. Dario... ...we have always known that it would end like that. No. We didn't know. I've only asked for more time. I gave you time. I can't believe I'm breaking up with you. Don't worry. You're not the first one. Actually, you've resisted more than the others. This time, I convinced myself that it would end in a different way. Stay here. I'll be right back. Excuse me! We have a patient of Doctor Caponi. - Please. - Sorry. My shift is over. But a colleague of mine is coming over. I'm here. Just a moment. I have to log in. Please, can you hurry up? - I can't log in. - Look, it's an emergency! - Keep calm. - Nurse, help! Can't you see she's sick? A stretcher, right away! - Keep calm. - Marta! Marta, I love you. Sweetheart. I care about you... ...but I risk getting really hurt this time. I'm sorry. It's the hospital. HOSPITAL So, the new lungs are not working as they should. Again, she has a very bad infection. Tell me, what's the worst thing that can happen? Hey, don't worry. It will all be fine. Marta will get better, hmm? Marta doesn't have anything to do with it. I have done a very bad thing. You know the video that's going viral? I'm the one who posted it. Well, it was obvious. You knew it was me? But why didn't you say anything? I was waiting for you to tell me about it. You mad at me now? Yes. I am very mad at you. Um, maybe I even understood why you did it. I was starting to get too much in the way, right? - Yes. - Hmm. I didn't know how to tell you. Why don't you delete the video? Not only am I keeping it, but... I even watch it from time to time. I feel sympathy for that frightened young boy, and... and I'm not ashamed to have been him. Well, not any more. I'm sorry. Having said that, now you have to do one thing for me, hmm? Mm-hmm. Hello, everyone. Surely, you've seen a video online of a guy who gets severely bullied. He is my boyfriend. - REALLY? - I DON'T BELIEVE IT His name is Giacomo. - SORRY? ARE YOU FOR REAL? - POOR GIACOMO! I posted that video. - THAT'S AWFUL. - HOW COULD YOU? I DIDN'T EXPECT IT FROM YOU. DIDN'T YOU THINK ABOUT HIM? I thought that by humiliating him, I would have felt stronger. HE'S THE VICTIM But then I realized that's not how it works. I've never felt more stupid in all my life. So, now I'm here to publicly apologise to Giacomo, on my behalf and on behalf of all the people who made fun of him. - SORRY, GIACOMO! - SO SORRY We are very sorry, Giacomo. I think I'll have to find myself a real job now. Hey. You'll never lose a follower in me. Open up, you bitch! Open the door! Open it! Your granddaughter is dying! You've been a piece of shit all your life! You never gave a damn! At least now do something for her! She needs you! Open the door! Open it! Open the fucking door! Please. Can I talk to you? - No, I don't have time. - Please. Don't you understand that you're letting her die? I'm moving her somewhere else! Marta is sick. Is there a possibility of her recovering? Yes, but it's not very likely. So, if you have a problem with me, I'm sure they can find a substitute here. But transferring her right now would be fatal. And you couldn't be the one requesting it, since you're not a relative. But I am. Have you come to enjoy the grand finale? I'm sorry. It's too late for a bedtime story. Once upon a time, there was a woman who was very selfish. She only thought about herself, as she'd always done. One day, though, she made a really big mistake. She fell pregnant. She tried to be a mother. "A woman who can't be a mother is not a woman," she'd tell herself. But all her efforts were in vain... and she started to drink. She started to hate her own daughter. Once, the little girl just wouldn't stop crying, and in that moment she even thought... So she kept her distance. She'd learn to live with that regret that crushed her, that almost didn't let her breathe, but she managed to push it back under the carpet. But... Then I came along. You came along. You had such a will to live. A positivity, a need for affection. The social worker didn't know that he'd left you with the worst possible person for you. That's something we agree on. I've thought of you every day, Marta. Every day. But that emptiness you felt, well, I simply was not able to fill it. I've never seen you cry. I think it's just my age. Here we are again. I've lost count of the times. This time is different. This time is really different. Can I have some water, please? Hi. Thank you. What were you talking about? Nothing. We weren't talking about anything at all. Actually, we were just silent. You've never been good at lying. Marta. I know. When will you ever stop playing the tough one, hey? Soon, I hope. Come over here. Hey. Hey. No more drawings. I don't want you to remember me like this. What are you talking about? You are beautiful to me. Penny for your thoughts. I'm afraid of losing you. I don't know what to do any more. I feel useless. It's because you already have done everything. I feel a bit tired now. I'll rest for a while, okay? Yes. I'll be here when you wake up again. Get him out. Excuse me. - Out. - What's going on? I'm going back in. Excuse me. She's all right. She's all right. She's all right! She's out of the woods. Oh God! My name is Ludovica Francesconi. I'm 20, and I come from Sora, near Frosinone. Actually, I lived there until I graduated high school. And then later on, I moved to Rome for my studies. My name is Jozef Gjura. I'm 25, and I was born in Albania. I started acting seriously, mm, when I was 18. My name is Gaja Masciale. I'm 22 years old, and I'm Apulian, from Bitonto. I chose to attend an academy. I chose the Silvio D'Amico Academy of Dramatic Arts, and I've just recently graduated. You know all those movies in which the main character has a terminal illness, but... but despite the chemo, ventilators, and dialysis, she's super hot and seduces the hottest guy of the school? Right. That's not my movie.
