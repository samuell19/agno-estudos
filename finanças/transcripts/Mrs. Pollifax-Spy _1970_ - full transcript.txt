[KNOCK ON DOOR]Yes. Mrs. Emily Pollifax. Oh, Mrs. Pollifax, how do you do? How do you do?Won't you have a seat? Oh, thank you.If you're a friend of Senator Murray's? Oh, yes, indeed, close friends. Yes. The Senator says you're very active in community groups, hospital work, civil defense. And that you'd like some information... Oh, that was for Philip's... The Senator's benefit. I had to say something. This isn't the easiest place to get into. Sorry, Mrs. Pollifax. But if we're not careful, we get all sorts of cranks. Just how can we be of service? Well, the real reason I came was to inquire about your spies. Inquire about...Your spies. Well, as a matter of fact, I believe they're all quite well. [GIGGLES] Oh, no, I didn't mean... I was wondering if you needed any. You see, I would like to apply for work as a spy. MASON: You're not serious. POLLIFAX: About becoming a spy? Of course I am. All my life I've dreamt of being a spy. Well, it's sort of like that doctor in England who wanted to conduct the London Symphony, and finally did. I've been housebound for years, happily so. But now that I'm a widow with no encumbrances, no responsibilities... But that doesn't necessarily mean...Oh, I realize that you know nothing about me, so I brought some letters of reference. Still, my only qualifications are those of character. My daughter is married and lives in Seattle. My son is a lawyer in San Francisco. And since I lost my husband and my children moved away, I manage to fill my days. The problem is with the nights. That goes for all of us. It's not just that I want to color the drabness of my life. I'm not any good at women's luncheons. And I would like to feel useful again especially in the service of my country, during these difficult times. I'm afraid you have a mistaken conception of the functions of the CIA. Oh, not at all. I know you have four major divisions Intelligence Collection and Evaluation, Science and Technology, Support and Administration and Secret Operations, known to you gentlemen as "Dirty Tricks." The point is, Mrs. Pollifax, we really don't recruit agents in this way. Oh, we sometimes use volunteers. But that's what I am, don't you see? A volunteer. Surely the CIA can find use for someone such as myself. And I am expendable. Just that fact might save someone. Someone more valuable. I don't mean to sound melodramatic, but I wouldn't have come if I weren't prepared to give my life. We appreciate the spirit in which you came. So if something comes up... Perhaps I should mention that I don't shrink from the sight of blood. I'll make a note of that. MASON: What is your address? 139 Charles Street, Montclair, New Jersey. MASON: Montclair, New Jersey. Oh, and you'll want to take your letters of recommendation with you, in case you want to seek other employment. No, please file them. This is the only work I'm interested in. [SIGHS] Well, uh, give my best to the Senator. Yes, I will. I'm dining with him tonight. I'll tell him I hope to hear from you very soon. She's perfect.

What if he doesn't make it by the 18th? He'll make it.And what about her children? I had her telephone them. She's taking a vacation. She lies beautifully. Her polygraph doesn't mean a damn thing. You should've warned me I was to have my picture taken. Is it for my passport? Oh, no, it's just for our files. As a tourist, you don't need a passport for Mexico. Oh, good morning, Mr. Mason. Good morning, Mrs. Pollifax. Great pleasure to see you again. I'm so glad you took my name and address. It showed such foresight. Well, shall we review your instructions once more?

Three days from now, on the 19th, at 10:00 a.m. I take a taxi for Calle del Siglo 37 to the bookshop El Papagayo Librereria, and look in the window for a copy of A Tale Of Two Cities. I enter only if I see the book, and ask to speak to Senor DeGamez. Splendid! Splendid! Go on. I say I would like to buy a copy of A Tale of Two Cities. Senor DeGamez says he doesn't have one. Then I tell him, "l saw a copy in your window," and point it out to him. That's when I say, "I think Madame DeFarge is simply gruesome, don't you?" Excellent! That last phrase is how he knows I'm the agent, uh, courier. Then he'll give me the book, and I return that same evening to Washington. Just think of it as a simple errand, like making a purchase in a department store. Doesn't sound dangerous at all. Well, you wouldn't want me to make more of it than it really is. There'll be no further contact between us unless there's a hitch. Uh, by that I mean a delay. In that event, you'll be contacted at the Reforma. Oh, how? Do I have a number? No, no.

Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Emily Pollifax, 139 Charles Street, Montclair, New Jersey. That is correct, General what-ever-your-name-is! I am a tourist from the United States of America, and I demand to know why you brought me here. To get for my superiors the same information you went to Mexico to get for your superiors. I don't know what all that gibberish means, but I do know I have a great deal to complain about and no consul to whom I can complain. I have been kidnapped. Which is a serious felony in my country. Robbed of my possessions, another felony. And brought to a godforsaken jail on top of a mountain in Albania. A country, according to a documentary film that I saw, inhabited by two million oppressed people who are trying to survive under the tyranny of the Red Chinese regime. And that is the greatest felony of them all. Mrs. Pollifax, as an agent of the CIA you must realize we wouldn't have brought you and Farrell halfway around the world, without being certain that you have what we want. I am committed to deliver it, and I assure you, I will. Colonel Nexdhet.Yes. See that these articles are examined immediately!Yes, sir. I am not an agent for the CIA. I am an American tourist. So is half your organization. [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING IN ALBANIAN] [LAUGHING] Mrs. Pollifax, you and I are going to do business together, pleasantly or unpleasantly, depending on your willingness to cooperate. For the moment we'll await Colonel Nexdhet's results. Corporal Stefan, return the prisoner to her quarters! If you brought everything from my hotel room, I would appreciate a change of clothes. That you will have. Take off my clothes? I refuse! Please, lady. It's SOP for all agents or suspected tourists. What are those?For feet. Would you mind?I watch. Over my dead body! I don't care about body, lady. I watch. [CHUCKLES] Then watch that! General say, no forget shoes, coat, hat. You, uh, want an American cigarette? Come on. Come on. Have it. Got a match? Tell me, is everybody here in the Secret Police? No. General Perdido, he come from Peking. P-E-R-D-I-D-O?Yah. Yeah. This is absurd! What do they expect to find in my things? Maps, film, diamonds, dope. Everything?Everything. [DOOR CLOSING]Join me, Comrade Pollifax. What is it? Well, it's a goat curd cheese, and Albanian bread, and goat milk with just a touch of saffron. How come you know so much about food? Well, sex and food are my only recreation. It may be drugged. Nope. No, not this time. No, my friend will want me sane, sober and alert. Friend? General Francisco Perdido y Wong, a half-Portuguese, half-Chinese scurrilous son of a bitch. Tried to kill him ten years ago. I missed. They got DeGamez. You know, it's Farrell that I can't figure. And your Mrs. Pollifax? Oh, she's still with us, I'd say. They tore her room apart, so they didn't get what they wanted. Where's Larrabee?Gone under. I had Maxwell wire the Pollifax kids from Mexico City. What, that she disappeared? Of course not! That she's having a wonderful time and decided to delay her return for a few days. Oh, that's nice.

Our comrades at headquarters in Tirana may have a different translation. Farrell? Why did you try to jump off that cliff? Because it was there. Oh, please eat. You've got to get well.For Perdido? No! So we can escape! Escape? You gonna carry me off this hill piggy-back? Don't be such a pessimist. I'm a realist. Now, you be a good little doctor and go make your house calls somewhere else.

There were not born yet, neither yesterday nor today, such men who could frighten the Albanians. The Albanian people were once like that. Fearless and free. It's really quite beautiful, your Albania. Come. I will lend you a book. It will tell you all about the greatness of our people. Oh, thank you, Colonel. Uh, the village below there...Mmm? Is that the one we drove through? NEXDHET: It's the only one in the valley. And the river beyond? That is the River Drin. Oh, uh. Would you, uh, cigarette? [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] That means, "No, thank you." But you may. Oh. Tell me, Colonel. This place, was it always a prison? No, before Perdido, it was a Communist camp under Stalin. Before that, it was a hideout for the Resistance. In the thirties it was a retreat for King Zog. It has been used by the Turks, Italians the Axis, the Allies. [CHUCKLES] Once, a long time ago, it belonged to the Albanians. Now, this way, please.

And complete with a guide to good restaurants, no doubt. Printed in 1919. But the topography of Albania hasn't changed!Yeah. What're you gonna do with that, break windows? We have to knock out some of the guards. And gag them.Yeah. I'll get more rocks tomorrow. Yeah, you do that. They make excellent paperweights. Oh, Farrell, I know I sound like an amateur. I am. But I'm a determined one.Yeah. You're also a pain in the...Please. Why won't you cooperate? All right, I will. I promise you I will cooperate. Now, if you steal Lulash's keys, so we can make a wax impression from the candle, then we can file a duplicate out of the bed leg. And then if you'll borrow a couple guns with about a hundred rounds of ammo, a crutch, and about 9,000 feet of nylon rope with a basket on the end of it, so that we can lower ourselves down to the airfield down below, where we will find a TWA 707 jet waiting, motors all revved up, completely staffed with a full crew and about a dozen gorgeous stewardesses who are going to serve us a magnificent dinner from Maxim's, with three great, vintage wines and a marvelous cigar. Now, if you can accomplish all that before Perdido returns, you waken me. And I will cooperate! Oh, that is good, very good. Very good. How long have you been assigned to this place, General? Too long. Three years. Is a lonely life. Have you any hobbies? I have a mistress. That should help pass the time. But she is not here. She is in Shkodere. It is good there. Very good, the massage. Your back would heal faster if we had some rubbing alcohol. No alcohol. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [BERISHA SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [LULASH SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [BERISHA SPEAKING ALBANIAN] I cured my niece's back.

[LULASH SPEAKING ALBANIAN] You forget that after General Perdido returns tomorrow, there'll be no more massages. Oh, Perdido! You know I am not revolutionary like Perdido. Listen to me, Mrs. Pollifax. You're foolish not to play his game. Otherwise, you will never leave here alive. Oh, General, I assure you I don't want to die. Then lie!Oh! But I'm no good at it. I forget what I was going to say and I get all mixed up. It's practice. Albanians are expert liars. And that's our teacher! Yeah. Yes. Colonel Nexdhet was telling me that my government recognized Comrade Hoxha. That is until he gave your country first to Russia, then to China. Aah! Look, always I salute like this. He say, like this! Aah, he say "Yes," I say yes. He say, "Kill!" I kill!No. It's wrong to kill. BERISHA: Not if it's the only way to remain alive. So, I salute Hoxha. I do business with Perdido, I survive!

Since I may not be with you much longer, you may have my niece. And her cousins. Thank you! That one! No, lady. General Berisha will...I like this one. [GUNSHOTS] Where the hell you been all day? POLLIFAX: Just doing what you told me to do. Making friends.Oh. Well, first I gave General Berisha his massage. Then, after that, we all had a bite of lunch. That's cozy, very cozy. Then, while Lulash went for my clothes, I was permitted to take a shower and shampoo my hair. And now I suppose you're puttin' on your glass slippers and goin' to a ball, right, Cinderella? [SIGHS] They ruined my shoes. Looking for microfilm, of all things. And it's a Christmas party. I could've used a few more pins. The dispensary only yielded six and then Stefan came up with another two. Yoo-hoo, I'm ready!What's that thing on your head supposed to be? Oh, this? Oh, it's the lining from my jacket.Mmm. It might please them if I went sort of, uh, Muslim. Native style. Oh, yeah. Sure. I'm sorry, Farrell. I did ask them if they'd carry you into the guardroom, but they refused. Oh, it's all right, it's all right, I understand, no chaperones. Well, so long as half the team scores. Now, remember, hold up your end, or is that an awkward phrase? Hello.Oh, good evening, Lulash. Don't wait up for me. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Mirdita. Is that a woman's name? No, Mrs. Pollifax. Mirdita is a place. Oh, it's beautiful.

All right, but we have to remove it before tomorrow, when General Perdido returns.Ah. Just a little lie, all right?[LAUGHING] All right. First we tell little lie and then we tell bigger lie and... Oh. Hey, Lulash. [LAUGHING] You jump too high. You losing keys! Help Mrs. Pollifax with tree. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Ah! My knife, please. Mrs. Pollifax! This for you and this for your friend, some cheese and cookies baklava. Oh, thank you, General.And now we drink a toast, to our friend and leader, Comrade Hoxha. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] You will join us, please? No. But I will drink to you, and to the Albanian people! I not drink to him either. I not drink to anyone who give our country away to Russia, to China. Sergeant Lulash, you're drunk. Hoxha didn't by himself give us away. General Berisha no say no. No, no, we give ourselves to China! Oh, why you say "we?" Yes, we.I no say okay. Stefan, he no say okay. Hey, he no say okay. Nestor, Nestor, he no say okay. If we give our country away again, give it to her. Oh, thank you, Lulash. I drink to the brave and noble men of the eagle.

Uh, no, General, please. Remember your back. Colonel Nexdhet will take the tree. Nexdhet? Here is keys. Thank you, General Berisha, for the lovely party. Sure. Music, music. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Can... [SIGHS] Colonel, how long were you in the Resistance? Let's say I still am. Thank you for lending me the book. May I keep the map? It will not save you. No one has ever succeeded. The card? No.Please. I will destroy it. Oh, no! Why? To keep you from doing something both stupid and fatal. So there are men born who can frighten the Albanians. Well, Cinderella, were you the belle of the ball? Since I was the only belle there. Well, what's the scavenger found now? Everything I came for. Farrell, can you sit up? Yeah. Yeah.We've got to celebrate. Celebrate, huh? Well, well, well. Merry Christmas. And a happy new year!Ho, ho, ho! Look! Some tourist. Not a tourist! But I'm not a spy either, I'm just a courier. Ah, ah, ah. Carstairs will spank. You can see now that we have to escape.Yeah. If you'll tell me what kind of a gun this takes, I'll try to get one tomorrow. Now, two men will go down tomorrow night for Perdido. Once it's dark, we can take the donkeys and go down and hide before they arrive. Then when they get out of the car and start up, we'll take it. Head north for Lake Scutari and get a boat there and get across to Yugoslavia. Just one thing. How do we get out of here?Well, we... And where do I find a Walther P38 automatic to fit this clip? I'll try...And three, where's my crutch? You know, I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, you're a hell of a one-woman organization! That means you're not going with me. No, you're going to have to do this one alone. Farrell, I...No, way. No way. [COUNTING IN ALBANIAN] Morning, Sergeant Lulash. No one to leave fort today, lady. General Berisha say you exercise here with men. LULASH: [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Sorry, lady. General Berisha very mad. Somebody steal General Perdido's brandy. He sent Colonel Nexdhet for new bottle. When do I give him his massage? No massage today, lady. Take car and go alone to Shkodere. [SOLDIERS LAUGHING] You get yourself a gun? No.Hmm. Lulash wouldn't let me out of his sight all day. Nice boy, Lulash. Somebody stole my knife. Stole your knife? Really? You all packed and ready to go? You're gonna wear a hole in the floor out there walking back and forth. There'll be another guard back here any minute to pick up the tree. Oh! Oh? What are you gonna do, hit him in the head? I told you. Well, show me how. Like that. Like that?Yeah. Do it again. Okay? Yeah, it won't work. Why not? Well, he'll see you coming through the door. Oh, yeah. That's worse. Here. [GROANS] Watch out.It's all right. It's all right. Try this. That?Yeah. Take it easy. Farrell, your leg.I'm all right. I'm all right. Here, give 'em a good whack with this one, eh. With that?Yeah. Put this down. Give a little whack. Wait! No, you never hit a man in the gut. You hit him on the head. Oh. No, no. He'll still see you coming through here. Stand over here.Oh. No, higher. Higher. That's better, all right. Oh. Shh! Lower. All right? Good luck. You better watch out for him. Anybody coming? No.Good. Then watch this. Now, watch. Complete, with a blanket around me. [SINGING JOYFULLY] I rehearsed. I practiced all night long. I don't know how useful I'll be, but I decided to join your army. Farrell. You're gonna need all the help you can get. [LOCKS CLANKING]Uh-oh! Remember... Remember, hit him on the head, and follow through. Don't stop in the middle. That way.[GRUNTS] Hit him again. Maybe I killed him. Oh, God. Get his gun. He hasn't got one.He hasn't got one? How delightful. Come on. Let's get out of here. Here. [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [BELLS ON DONKEYS CLANKING] The gun. Cut the bells off the donkeys. The what? The bells.Oh! Shh! FARRELL: Damn that moon! Hurry up, you goat herders. [ALARM WAILING] Hold it! Lulash, get your men down to the foot of the cliff. And don't come back without the prisoners! You... You Albanian... All right, get out of here. Go on, beat it. Go on. Hang onto me. We can't climb down there. Let's go. No. Hold it. Careful. Go on down. FARRELL: All the way down. [SOLDIER SCREAMING] Phew! Come on in. You first. Come on in.There. [GRUNTS] Slowly, slowly. Now go slowly, Farrell. Farrell! Well, that's progress. Shh! Look! [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Where you going? Come back! Damn fool! [SHEEP BLEATING] [GASPS] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Beads... You... Pretty beads. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Understand? [SHEEP BLEATING] How's the atmosphere down there? Plenty Western.[LAUGHS] Come on, sheep. Come on, goats. Come on, goats, come on. You wanna know something? Yeah. When can I get up? For a tourist lady from Montclair, New Jersey, you make one hell of a nanny! Thanks a lot! No, I mean it. You're one of the few great broads that I've ever known. One of the few, eh? Don't let it go to your head, honey. Come on. Phew! Are you okay? I would be if I had a gallon of water and a pint of Chanel No. 5. [CHUCKLES] Come on. Fale minderes. [PANTING] Oops!Oh. Keep your head down. [HORSE NEIGHING] Fan me. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Fale minderes. Oh, boy. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Are they coming? Huh?I can't see. So much dust. Lake Scutari can't be too far. It better not be. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] FARRELL: We're out of gas. Hang on. Into the corn field. Hurry. Lulash. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [LEAVES RUSTLING] Wait here. [GRUNTS] [WHISTLING] Where the hell are you?POLLIFAX: Here. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] They've gone. Rest a minute.Yeah, but they'll be back. They'll be back.Oh! Oh, yes. Thank heavens for that bag of tricks of yours. Hey, what's that mess? Goat curd cheese, baklava, cakes from the party. You know, I think I'll just have a little goat curd cheese. Not from Maxim's, but then nothing is as I planned it. Nothing ever is in life, honey. I'm sorry about your leg. I didn't figure on your walking like this, Farrell. Yeah, well...May I? Yeah. Help yourself.Bury this. [YELPS] Farrell, please... I'm sorry. Here, take another drink. Yeah, yeah. Don't waste good brandy like that, woman. [GRUNTS] That leg was coming along just fine and you decide to anesthetize it. Oh, Farrell, I didn't mean it, really. What are you doing with that card? It's safer here than it is in my bag. [SIGHING] [COW MOOING] I must say, knighthood is still in flower. That soldier back there, did you kill him? I tried to. Oh, yes. He played the zither at the party. Oh.[DOG BARKING] Get back to it. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Come on. Come on. Fale minderes.Leave the cow alone. Come on, this way. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] FARRELL: Well, it's not much, but it floats. ROGER: My mother, the CIA? Easy, boy, easy. You're screwy! My mother's Mrs. George Pollifax, housewife, club woman, patriot! Mr. Pollifax... Roger... I've heard about you guys before. I read the papers! Time, Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal. I was afraid it was going to come to this. Hand me that recorder, Mason. POLLIFAX: [ON RECORDER] But that's what I am, don't you see, a volunteer. And I am expendable. But I wouldn't have come if I weren't prepared to give my life. Wake up. Look, civilization. Come on. FARRELL: Shkodere! That's where we are. We're deeper in Albania than when we started. Oh, dear God. Let me see that map. Isn't that a river? Yeah. It flows all the way from the lake to the Adriatic. We'll have a current. Let's take the boat. How's the leg? Still there. We've come a long way. You have. I just limped along. I told you we'd make a good team. [CHUCKLES] Hold on. Hang on. [WAVES SPLASHING] POLLIFAX: How much longer? Farrell, you did beautifully. Yeah, I did, didn't I? [CHUCKLES] [BOAT APPROACHING] General! PERDIDO: Remember, I want them alive. Farrell! Look! There! [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] They're gonna ram us. [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] Lulash, you crazy? To the left, to the left! [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] PERDIDO: [SHOUTING] Lulash! Help! Lulash! Come back! [SPEAKING ALBANIAN] POLLIFAX: [ON RECORDER] When the freighter dropped us at Dubrovnik, I insisted Farrell go to the hospital. He made his usual fuss and refused to spend the night. While I phoned you, he talked to our consulate in Belgrade to take care of Lulash. Later we caught the plane to London and then home. I think that's all. FARRELL: [ON RECORDER] Take your time. POLLIFAX: Farrell, did I leave out anything important? FARRELL: Yeah. You forgot to tell them I love you. POLLIFAX: Oh, stop. [CHUCKLING] Sorry to put you through this, but it's very important to get it all down before one forgets. But I'll never forget it. Not any part of it. Ever! If you happen to think of anything, just give me a call. Mason, give Mrs. Pollifax my private number. I don't know how to thank you. I know how you can. How?Well, I have a niece I'd like Sergeant Lulash to meet. Sure, where do we find her? 1766 Union Street, San Francisco. And her name? Lotus Wong. Get on that, Mason! And clear the sergeant through immigration. Oh, thank you. Thank you so very much. Oh, by the way, I think Colonel Nexdhet would make a wonderful counter spy. Mason! Uh, Johnny, thank you again, and after you drop Mrs. Pollifax off at the hotel, would you give me a call? Why?I have something pending. Let it pend. I'm gonna sleep for a week. Oh, Mason! A little gift...Oh, my! ...from the man upstairs. Oh, thank you. Oh, and, Mr. Carstairs, be sure to thank him.I will. I don't mean to be unethical but the microfilm, was it helpful? Very. It's at the White House. White Hou... [CLEARS THROAT]
