Ah, I wouldn't exactly call it conquering the world teaching a bunch of fourth graders, but I'm happy. How're you liking the city so far? It's... big. A little lonely, I guess. Oh, my gosh.

Well, since Owen and I got married. But it's been the best three summers of my life. And work lets you take off? Well, the McAllister's throw a bunch of dough into the startup, so as long as I bring my laptop I'm golden. Ooh! This. Definitely take that. Oh. Oh, we get to spend the entire summer together. - It's going to be so much fun! - And I get to meet Owen. Yes! You have no idea how much fun you're going to have. Well, I did manage to save some money but I'm on a teacher's salary, so, I just hope we don't have too many expenses. Mm. I think you'll be alright. Whoa. I mean, do you think that maybe you could've warned me that your parents live in an ocean side paradise? I didn't want to freak you out. And I just happen to grow up here. Why didn't you tell me about any of this? Oh, and miss this? 'So what he's crazy rich. Who cares?' let's just have an amazing summer. - Do you want to go? - No. I'm just.. A little out of my element. I'm serious, i-i-if you're uncomfortable w-we can, we can go spend the summer at home or, or with your parents. In a two bedroom colonial in downtown Baltimore? No. I mean.. I think I can make this work. - 'Aaron? Is that you?' - Last chance. - Run while you still can. - 'Hello.' oh, you must be the famous Brandi. - Nice to meet you. - Brandi green. Delta psi beta Rossmore university. A masters in teaching from Tate-Riley university. Impressive. Don't forget the debate team, or track. All conference record in the 200 meter, I believe. Google, my dear. And private detectives. Kidding. Kidding. 'If my son loves you, we love you.' alright? Leave your bags here, let's go outside and get to know each other a little better. Come on. - She's perfect. - She's beautiful. Oh! 'Prodigal son has returned.' - 'oh! Owen!' - Bring on the fattened calf. - 'No need to get up.' - Hey, hey, hey! I'm gonna go get you a drink. - I've heard a lot about you. - Oh, really? Google or private investigators? Jackie told me. Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you. - Welcome to the family. - How was Shanghai? Oh, Leonard, let's not talk about business. - It's Brandi's first night. - Oh, no. I-It's fine. - I'm interested in this stuff. - Really? In that case, let's raise our glasses. To Brandi. - To Brandi. - Welcome to our home. Aw. To you guys. - 'Cheers!' - 'cheers!' - so nice to meet you guys. - Oh! Come in? - In a minute. - I'm counting. 'Enjoying the view?' what? Are you a guest of the McAllisters? - I'm Reid. I work here. - Oh. 'I make sure everything is safe and secure.' 'Kay. 'Please!' 'someone help me.' 'help me.' Aaron? [Intense music Aaron. Please! Please! Help me! Please! Am I dreaming? Sleep walking again. Just a dream. - Good morning, sleepy head. - 'Good morning.' - coffee? - Yes. How did you sleep? Weird. You slept weird? Did I sleep-walk last night? 'You were sound asleep when I came back to bed.' you got up? Well, Owen saw me get up for water. 'He and Jackie got in a fight, so went outside' 'for some night air in a night cab.' were you worried? No, I mean, I, I had this weird dream. It was so lifelike. There was this woman, and she needed my help. And then she was gone. What'd she want? I don't know. But it was so real. Well, you know what they say about your dreams? What? That you're the star of all of your dreams. Even if you look different. Okay, so, then.. What did I need? Well, I'm guessing, the perfect pancake. Which happens to work out because it's my specialty. Coming right up. Enjoying my little home? Oh. - 'Here you go.' - 'Thank you.' it's nice. It's nice to have a place to just... decompress. Well, then, to decompressing. To decompressing. Yeah, listen, I've to get back up to the kitchen. Fiona, you know.. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Hey. I've been looking for you. Hey.. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Fine. It's, um.. Work stuff. Look, I know that you have Owen.. But I'm here if you need anything. Absolutely. Looks like prince charming is requesting your presence. Oh. He can wait if you need me. Oh, stop it. Seriously. I'm fine. Go. Okay, so I know you're about to have a bunch of questions but I'm here asking you to just trust me. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. Turn around. - What are you doing? - Careful. Careful. - Alright. - Are you here? - I'm here. Turn around. - Where? - Where am I going? - Right here. - I got you. I got.. I got you. - Okay. Okay. - Alright. - Okay. - Put your arm around me. - Okay. Alright, just tell if I'm going to fall. 'I will tell you.' It's going to be okay. - Okay. Right here. - Okay. Okay. I going to take off the blindfold. Brandi green.. Oh, my god. I have loved you since the second I met you. You are hilarious weird and smart.. And the only one I want to be with. I can't imagine spending one minute of my life with you. Brandi green, will you marry me? Yes. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! So many yesses. Okay, okay. I got you. 'Let's have a toast.' - to Brandi and Aaron. - Right. 'Aw. Yes, guys. We're..' I've always wanted a sister. Well, I've always wanted a brother. Ah. We are just so happy to have you here. 'Thank you, guys, so much.' I-I can't believe this is real. Have you seen this? - Oh, my god! - 'Well done.' and to my little brother who obviously has exceptional taste. - Yes, indeed. - 'Aw.' and to finally closing that Veronica chapter for good. Oh.. I-i-I'm sorry. Aaron, I thought you told her. Who's, who's Veronica? Some gold digging con artist who only wanted Aaron's money. 'I'm sorry I didn't tell you about her.' she and I dated in college. Apparently, she was more interested in my bank account than me. - You had to say something? - 'She broke my heart.' I had to pick up the pieces. 'It wasn't pretty.' you know I'm nothing like that, right? I know. 'But at the time it really did a real number on me.' Owen was there to see me through the heartbreak and has been a little over-protective of me 'ever since.' 'Well, that's because he loves you.' 'Mm.' just like I love you. You know, I'm just glad that he found someone true. - Shh. - 'Whoo!' - Do it again. - Aw. Do it again. Oh, hey. - 'You're up late.' - Couldn't sleep. 'I don't know why, I've just been tossing 'and turning lately.' here you go. A nice cup of tea fixes everything. - This is perfect. So homie. - I'm so glad. Thanks. Welcome to the family, sweetheart. 'It's just San Francisco.' 'This is gonna be the longest 24 hours ever.' 'I'll be back before you know it.' I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back by tomorrow at noon. And, if you wait, I'll make you pancakes for brunch. Well, in that case, I will sleep through breakfast and expect chocolate chips and strawberries. Brandi. I know something that will cheer you up. - What? - Have you ever been clamming? 'So where're we going for this clam digging adventure?' 'We are going to the perfect place' for a mother-daughter-in-law day. When I was young, this was the family home. And now it's our vacation cabin. I grew up on the muck. Watching for clams on the lake's bed.. Waiting for the water to squirt up leaving a hole that guided me to my treasures. - Ducks. - Yep. They're family too. I didn't even know lakes even had clams. Oh, yeah, freshwater clams are the best, super tasty. Muck is rich, deep fertile soil. And good soil makes for good chowder. Did Aaron and Owen dig for clams too? Kind of. More, like, they used the clams to skip across the water and see how many bounces they could get. Always trying to outdo each other. And now, for the best part. What? Homemade clam chowder. I'm gonna share with you our family recipe. Come on. Let's go. - Yes. Okay. - Alright. Clam chowder, here we come. - Look at all of them. - I know, right? Good girl. - So? - This is so good. - 'Wow!' - you made this? Well, not exactly. I followed Fiona's every direction and managed not to burn the house down. 'No. She's just being modest. - 'She's a natural.' - Excuse me. 'Good evening, Mr. McAllister. I'm sorry to bother you.' 'Uh, no problem.' uh, this is Brandi. Reid, how about some clam chowder. It's delicious. No, thank you, ma'am. - 'We have an issue.' - 'Alright.' let's go to my office. Ladies.. And Brandi, this is the best clam chowder I've ever had. Thank you. Don't mind Leonard, he's always working. Is Reid Leonard's business partner? Hah! Heavens no. Uh, he's Leonard's chauffeur and bodyguard, and.. I guess Jack of all trades. Jack of all trades? Whatever Leonard needs, Reid does. Honestly, he's been with us for so long I don't even remember that he's an employee. Mm. I wish I could cook like this. Mm. Mm. 'It was great. She took me clamming at the lake house.' 'she taught me how to make calm chowder.' 'and it was delicious.' 'I even think your mom was impressed.' good. She took you clamming? - She must really like you. - I hope so. - Come back, I miss you. - I miss you too. - Well, how'd it go? - Good. Easy. I've got one more thing to do tonight and then it's back in the morning. 'I just wish I knew about this trip before.' Jackie's here, but it's, it's just strange that you aren't. 'Family-work obligations come up like this sometimes.' 'I don't, I don't know what to say.' okay. Sleep tight. Hey, is everything okay? Yeah. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. Anything. - You know that. - What's Reid's deal? - Why? - I don't know. He just.. He rubs me the wrong way. He's harmless, I promise. I'll see you soon. 'No!' 'I'll do anything. Please.' no, please! I'll do anything. No! 'If you make a move, I'll kill you.' 'nod if you understand.' 'go back inside and remember nothing.' 'Brandi, I’m.. Look, I'm so sorry about last night.' we'll, uh, we'll keep looking. - 'Absolutely.' - 'thank you.' I'm so sorry, baby. I got the first flight back this morning. I was so scared. And you don't know who did this? Well, we searched the grounds last night and the first thing this morning and nothing. And what about the security cameras? I went over them all, and the only thing they picked up was some damn cat and, of course, Brandi outside later. Are you okay? Yeah. Your family's been great. Just please don't go away again. - I won't. - Hey, you're back. - How did it go? - Did you know about last night? Reid and I did a sweep, but we didn't find anyone. 'Honestly, I figured it's some homeless guy.' there are a bunch of 'em down by the lake they keep wandering down here. - He wasn't homeless. - How do you know, honey? Shoes. 'His shoes were black.' 'it was dark, I didn't see much, but the shoes were..' they were leather, and it looked expensive. Which could include about anybody in this zip code. - What did the police say? - We didn't call the police. Look, son, I know these guys, okay? The only thing they're gonna do is come out and file a report. What're we gonna tell 'em? Brandi was attacked? By whom? Where are the tracks? The evidence? 'I'm telling you, I searched and found nothing.' still, we should make a report. Son, this could really blow up in our faces if the press get wind of this. Now I'd hate to see you brought into 'the public eye in this way.' Brandi? Sure. Where's Jackie? She had to, uh, go into the city on business. - In the middle of the night? - Of course not. This morning. Oh. Right. 'She wouldn't leave in the middle of the night.' 'that's crazy. It's-it's-it's just..' she-she didn't say goodbye. - Yeah. - That's Jackie. Yeah, right. Come on. This has been a lot for anyone to process. We need to get out of here. 'Let's make an escape, and go for a run.' 'that'll clear the fog out of this nightmare.' Brandi, I promise, we're gonna keep looking. Why didn't she say goodbye? 'Hey, Jackie. It's me. Didn't say goodbye.' 'give me a call.' 'Wait up.' 'slow down.' 'I knew I could cheer you up.' I just didn't know it was gonna kill me to do it. Oh! Whoo! - I win. - 'Oh!' I need to get to the gym more often. - Oh, you look great. - You're sweaty. - So are you. - I know. But I'm sweaty and out of shape. You're a machine. Are you okay? Yeah. Just.. I was freaking out. I know. I'm so sorry. I guess I just wish they call the authorities. I suppose you should get used to this if you're going to be a McAllister. What? Random assaults? Well.. Kinda. With this kind of wealth comes a lot of attention both good and not so good. What do you mean? You'd be surprised that how much the press loves a scandal especially at this level even if it's untrue. But this was an assault, not a scandal. I know, but you'd be shocked how the media and outsiders can twist things back on you. I know my dad and Owen are just trying to protect you from this kind of exposure. It's brutal. That's why they didn't report it. Hm. You're one of us now, so.. I suppose you should know this is not a glamorous aspect of it. - Hm. - But, please understand, okay? We will do everything we can to protect you. Of course. Anything that they need, anything that you need I'm here for you. 'Hey, I'm missing you.' 'where're you? Text me back. Bye.' Hey, I'm kinda.. Kinda worried about you. Will you please call me? Please. Bye. - Need something? - Oh! You scared me! Sorry. I was just, um.. What is this place? - Extra storage garage. - Oh. Why is it locked? Well, remember the homeless problem? We once caught a few of 'em squatting there. Made sense to lock it. Makes sense. I know. Do you want to look inside? I-I think mom keeps her extra holiday decorations in there. It's okay. It's just.. I saw Reid coming out of there. He crashes in there sometimes when he doesn't want to drive home. Anything else? Do you know where Jackie is? I told you, she's in the city for work. It's just, she hasn't replied to any of my messages. You think she's mad at me? No idea. Do you want me to try texting her for you? No, no. - That's okay. - Yeah? - Mm-mm. - Okay. Am I overreacting? - It's only been a day, Brandi. - I guess. But, when I asked Owen about Jackie, he seemed a little off. Off? What do you mean off? Nice? I think he knows something about Jackie he's not telling me. Brandi. Well, what if she's in trouble? Trouble? What kind of trouble? I-I know this sounds crazy.. But I saw someone dragging something. Looked like a body. And then today, I looked in the fire pit where I was attacked and found a burned ID that.. I'll show it to you. It's, it's in our room. And then Jackie all of a sudden goes on this business trip? And she's not replying to any of my text messages. - I mean.. - Brandi, you can't be serious. I don't know, Aaron, but something is going on here. And that Reid guy... He really rubs me the wrong way. I'm just scared for Jackie, okay. And you think Owen knows something about all this? I don't know. You want me to talk to him? Yes. That would mean a lot to me. Okay. Done. Anything for my fiancee. - Hey. - It's.. - Your okay? - Yeah. I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explanation for all this. Hello? What do you mean there's a problem with the shipment? It's not a problem. I just don't like holding on to the merchandize longer then I have to. Hello? 'Of course, complications occur.' anyone there? It was a complication. Fine. Yeah, I understand. Hey little brother. Is everything okay? No. But it will be. - Work stuff? - Always. You got the better end of the deal. I'd like to be the one giving the the money away instead of making it. Join me. Sometimes, there's nothing I'd rather do. But... won't happen. You know I crave excitement. You always have. You always have. So, how can I help you? Spit it out. This is gonna sound a bit convoluted... Oh, is this about Brandi being a little paranoid? You know how people panic when they can't get ahold of someone 24-7. It's only been one day, Aaron. I love Brandi but.. - But what? - I mean. It's been a day. How many times have we not been able to get ahold each other? You're right. I know. Plus, Jackie texted me 20 minutes ago. She's fine. Do you want me to show it to you? Show it to Brandi? No, it's fine. I'm-I'm sorry. Come on, what is this really about? I don't understand? - Does it seem Brandi.. - Brandi what? I mean, is she uncomfortable here? She did say Reid was a little off. 'I mean, yeah, she's upset, she thinks she saw a dead body' being dragged across the backyard. 'And she found a woman's burned up ID in the firepit.' - it's a lot. - I see. 'Well, I don't know about a body and a ID' but of course Reid is a little off. We've known him since we were kids. He's always been a little odd. Who knows what the dude does in the night. Like I said, I love Brandi, but.. Come on, she's overreacting. It's me, Aaron. Your brother. Trust me. I know. You're right. I got work to do. You try to relax a little, brother. Owen, please. Yup. Oh, my god! - 'Owen?' - yeah? Reid is loading up the last run, you wanna help him out? I have to help your mom in the kitchen. - Hurry up. - Yeah. I'll do that. 'Hey, don't forget to grab the thing from the room.' 'Yep.' - Right? - That was great, mom. - Thank you. - Of course. Hey, you know what? You know what I was thinking? Maybe we could all go for a walk. It's going to be such a lovely evening. Yeah, that sounds perfect because then I can burn off some of that pie you forced me to eat. Oh, so she forced that third piece on you? Her powers run deep, son. You'll understand those power soon enough. Oh, I already do. This one forced me to run three miles today. Told you, it's powerful stuff. I hope you don't mind me asking. Where's Owen? Oh, uh, he made his apologies. He had some work stuff come up. But maybe he can meet us a little later for a drink. I'm sorry. I'm just concerned about Jackie? I wasn't sure if you guys have heard anything bad. I already told you, she texted Owen earlier. She's fine. Did Owen show you those text messages? Don't. Hey, um, why don't we just go for that walk now, okay? Okay, so we can just ignore the obvious? Or so you can stop being rude to my family. Oh! Oh, okay. 'I'm so sorry.' Fiona... Leonard. I don't know what just came out of my mouth. - That was... - It's fine, love. It's understandable after the incident. I think I'm just overly tired or.. I keep waking up at the night, you know. I haven't been getting enough sleep. It's fine. We'll go on the walk and then get you to bed early. Perfect, the night air works magic. Sure. Pretty soon, you'll be good as new. Remember the first summer when we came here, huh? Aaron came running into our room almost every night? - I was five. - And afraid of ghosts. Well, in my defense they were enormous ghosts. - Oh-ho-ho. - Boo! Oh, wow. - 'Where are you going?' - 'I just need to go for a run.' 'And think.' - Brandi, look out. - Oh! Oh, it's, it's you. Um, I, I was just, I was out for a run. So.. Jogging? Just trying to get to know the area. 'Well, you seen one family country estate' you've seen them all. Right. I was actually trying to escape this enormous mansion. 'Well, you aren't the first person' 'who want to escape.' yeah. Okay. 'Be careful out there. See you soon.' I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I can't find it. That ID isn't here. - Are you okay? - Sure. It's just seems like since the attack everyone's been so quick to dismiss everything that I'm thinking or feeling. And I was the one who was attacked. Brandi, I'm sorry. It just seems like nobody else is concerned that I was attacked or that Reid gives me the creeps or that Jackie doesn't reply to any one of my messages but she conveniently replies to Owen's? I'm not discounting your feelings and I'm so sorry my family isn't stepping up more. Brandi, please, just stop. I love you. I love you. Where's Jackie? She had to go into the city on business. Don't. Aaron! Help! Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Take it easy. It's gonna okay. I'm here. I'm here. 'That ID might be missing but I can show you the body.' 'it's just up here.' 'I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.' It's fine, I'm just glad I have proof. We'll find out who's doing this. I promise. - But I searched this area... - Owen, stop talking. Aaron... We're gonna search again, okay? Yeah, sure, I might have missed something. - What if it's Jackie? - It won't be. But what if it is? I wouldn't be able to forgive myself. - What if my dream was true? - Dream? Brandi thought she saw a woman in the hall who needed help. I really hate that this is happening to you. Thank you, Leonard. Hold on. Reid, go up and make sure it's safe. Yeah. - I don't see anything. - Keep looking, Reid. I'm telling you there's nothing. It was right here. - Are you sure? - Yes! Maybe it's somewhere else? No. It was here. It was definitely here. Please. I told you. Oh, god, I can't look. You can look. Nothing here, except that ol' stump. What? - You moved it. - Oh, come on. You know I'm about done with this nonsense, Brandi. I know the difference between a stump and a dead body, okay? Are you trying to make fools of us? Brandi. Stop. Aaron, I need you to believe me. - I'm going back to the house. - Shoes. - Shoes. - Brandi, please, stop. - No... - You can't be serious? The shoes will solve this. Come on. It's very convenient. The ID. I told you. I'm too busy for this. What's going on, Brandi? Brandi, what are you doing in my room? - You'll see. - I'll see. No one else has a problem with this? You seem have some pretty distinct shoe wear, Owen. You've been going through my things? Brandi, I'm on your side, okay, but that's just.. Okay, what is going on? Brandi. Brandi. You should probably apologize to my family. They were there. I swear to you, Aaron. - I am not crazy. - I know. But you did practically accused my brother of murder. Maybe he was set up. Maybe-maybe.. Maybe it was Reid. Maybe, Reid, he-he killed Jackie and then he buried the body and then he moved the body and then he ditched the shoes... Do you even hear yourself? Aaron, I'm just saying, I swear. Jackie is missing and I saw a dead body last night. Jackie is just fine. She's in the city for work, Brandi. It was dark out last night and you were upset. - You don't believe me. - I want to. I do. It's just, you don't have any evidence. Evidence? Our relationship is based on trust. And if we don't have trust.. We don't have a relationship. I'm sorry, bro. I really am. - What are you talking about? - I'm just sorry. - About everything. - Owen... Trust me, little brother. I wish it was different. - Hey, guys! - Where were you? I was, I was texting you. Oh, sorry, I, I texted Owen and then immediately dropped my phone in the sink and then I had business meetings all day and didn't get a chance to get a new one. Is everything okay? 'Aaron.' Don't move. Relax. No. No. No, no, no. Don't do this. Please. I don't want you to go. I know, but it's probably better that I do. At least until... Look, we can work through this. I just gotta calm my family down. I understand. I love you. Brandi, I.. Baby, I'm gonna drop her over at the airport and get a massage and I'll be back later. - Bye. - Okay. Bye. Have a safe flight, I'll see you at the end of the summer. Bye. Jackie, what's that? So, are you gonna.. What is this place? Why couldn't we talk in the car? - Two coffees please. - Sure. Okay. - Okay, first of all, I'm sorry. - For what? For getting you involved in this family but... when I introduced you and Aaron I honestly, I didn't know. - I, I had my suspicions but.. - What suspicions? Oh, god, I can't believe I'm so naive. Jackie, you're freaking me out. I had to get more information and I had to get you out of my car. Because? Because I'm pretty sure they're bugging it. Owen's probably having me followed right now. What? Jackie. What are you talking about? Mm. Hi. Thank you. What's going on? It's why I ditched my phone last weekend. They were bugging it. It's why I pretended to have a business trip because I needed to find more information. So I drove to the airport and I parked my car and then rented a car with cash and I... Hang on. Hang on. Slow down. - Okay. - Jackie, what is going on? The McAllisters. Leonard, Owen, maybe even Aaron, I-I don't know.. They're dealing in illegal trade. What are they trading? People. They're trading people. - Trading people? - Shh! Yes. I found this woman's ID burned in the firepit in the back of the house. Where is it? Can I see it? It's gone, someone stole it. I found a pile of women's clothes last month and someone that tried to burned them but there were still some left and I asked Owen about it but he just yelled at me laughed in my face, but then a couple of days ago I found a bracelet so I confronted Owen about it thinking maybe he was cheating on me but he just said it belonged to his mother. But the thing is, the bracelets had initials on it 'd.D..' I mean he didn't even bother with a clever lie. Oh, my god! It wasn't a dream. She's real. It wasn't a dream. She's.. - I saw her. - Denise Dameron. She's been missing for weeks. She's all over the Internet. She was so scared.. Please. There are more of them. - There are many more of them. - No. What else could the burned clothes and Denise's bracelet mean? So, I started looking into things on my own. Following him, watching him, his dad. It doesn't makes sense. Leonard's a multimillionaire. Why would he be involved in something like this? - Or Owen. - For the power. Or the control. I don't know. Jackie, some of these flyers are dated five years ago. Have you talked to Owen about this? I can't until I have enough proof. But now, with your sighting and testimony... The shoes... from my attack. They were in his closet and suddenly they go missing. He's all over this. You've gotta get away from him. I have tried. He always finds me. And I have nothing to take to the authorities. I need you to help me get evidence. Because, if, if we both come forward with evidence they have to listen to us, right? Owen has a ledger in his desk. It has all the names of the girls and the prices he got from them. I saw it. That's when I knew for certain. God, I don't know what to do because if he goes down he's gonna take me with him and I, I can't go to.. No, no, no, no. Hey. We are gonna stop them, okay? We will find that ledger and we're gonna find out if Aaron is involved. He's not, it's not possible. I really hope you're right but we have to be prepared for anything. I mean, I don't know if those girls ever.. We gotta go. Hi, you see that sweet looking fella over there he just offered to pay for our bill. Said I should just let you know? That's so sweet. Well, have a good one. Let's go. Who was that guy? That guy works for the McAllisters and we need to get out of here. How do you know that? Because if he didn't, he would've caused a scene about paying that bill but that guy he, he wants out fast 'cause he's on the clock. And, hey, remember, the car is probably bugged so I'll find somewhere else for us to finish this conversation. - That guy was following us? - Yes. And the McAllisters ordered this? Don't know if it was Leonard or Owen but... it was one of them. Why? Well, clearly they don't trust one or either of us. We both have been asking questions they don't want asked. Okay. - Are you okay? - I'm fine, I'm just.. I'm thinking. Okay, here's what we're gonna do you're gonna go back and you're gonna tell Owen that we stopped at the diner. What? But I already told him that... I know but the guy clearly saw us so why lie? Just say that I was distraught I-I couldn't get on the plane. We had to have girl talk about Aaron you know, I was upset and you had to calm me down and then you drove me to the airport. Okay. Then you're gonna go back to the house and you're gonna tell Owen that you're you're sick of me and my drama. Why? You need Owen to see your loyalty. He needs to think that you're all in. This way he'll trust you. Okay, well, what about Aaron? - Aaron, Aaron's not involved. - But what if he is... He's not involved, I know it in my heart and if he is, our relationship is over anyway. Do you have a tarp or a coat or something in the car I can use? I have a blanket in my trunk. Perfect. I'm gonna hide in the backseat. When it gets dark, I'm gonna find out what's going on. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for believing in me and confiding in me. It's nice to have someone in my corner. I know. Let's do this. Come on. Let's go. Here. Hey, be careful. You too. 'We're almost there.' - How is she? - Gone. Fine. I mean, no, she's not fine. I couldn't even take her right to the airport. What do you mean? Well, she's there now, but she was kinda hysterical so I had to talk her off the ledge first. - I should go to her. - Why, Aaron? It's not gonna change anything. She just doesn't fit. She's not part of this family. Honestly I think it's more than she can handle. I think she was just in it for the money. You were supposed to be her friend, Jackie. And you're supposed to have a little common sense. What the hell is that supposed to mean? What it's always meant, family first. Hey, don't take it out on Jackie just 'cause you trusted the wrong person again. Jesus, Owen. Hey. I know I've been a bit extra lately and I'm sorry. Truly. I think, I think talking to Brandi tonight just revealing... and I don't ever wanna do that to you. - I'm so sorry. Okay. - Okay. Wherever you go, I go. Whatever you do, I do. For better or for worse. Sweet pea, you okay? Yes. No. No, not really. Is there anything I can do? I'm sorry, baby, I-I-I so hoped that you two would work but she might not be the.. Might not be what, mom? Aaron, it's family first, no questions asked. Oh, honey, you always were my sensitive one, sweet pea. Which is fine. It's lovely. Just remember your place. It's here, with your family. The ones you can always count on. Are you listening to me? I need to go for a drive. I need to clear my head. Of course. Brandi, call me. I'm... I'm sorry. I love you. Talk to me, please. Who's there? 'Hey.' 'hey!' 'hey.' We've been a lot though.. No, remember the Eden rock hotel that we went to.. Oh.. - Hold on. - Oh, not at the table. Hey. Yeah, I think we have a problem. 'You've been misinformed.' 'didn't Jackie say Brandi was gone?' - yes. - She's not. Just chased her in the woods but I lost her. Yeah, I see. - 'What should I do?' - Just come back to the house. - 'I'll take care of it.' - Alright. Is everything okay, honey? Just a logistics issue. Nothing I can't take care of easily. Jackie. Can I have a word with you? Of course. I'll be back. Where we going? Well, I gotta take care of something but first I wanna show you something. Okay. Ow! 'You're hurting me, Owen.' 'babes.' 'ow, you're hurting me.' oh, really? Am I hurting you? Really, Jackie? You know what hurts, hm, or causes a lot of pain? - Owen. - Betrayal. Oh-oh-oh! Sit! My trusted wife, whom I love have broken a sacred vow between us. The ultimate deception. Do you know what happens to people who deceive me? Owen. I didn't. I would never do.. I invested years into you. Into our bond. - Into our agreement. - Owen... We, we were going to built an empire together. We're gonna rule everything. You were going to provide me with an heir. The good thing about being rich is I can get anybody to do that. The next shipment goes out tomorrow. - Shipment? - Yeah. I know how much you loved to travel. You sure about this, boss? I want her in so deep her own mother won't be able to find her. Hey, Owen? I need... - What are you doing here? - Uh, I was just... Stop. I'm going to ask you for that once politely. Now, if we wait for Owen, it won't nearly be as civil. Uh-uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't go out there. Those people out there aren't as kind as me. Now, you stay right there. 'Hey, Reid? Reid, I need you over here.' 'Bitch!' Brandi, you scared the daylights out of me! Fiona, I have no time to explain I just need, I need a phone or a car, alright. There are some really bad things going on. What are you talking about? Are you okay? Where's Jackie? Or Aaron? - Where's Aaron? - Aaron went for a drive. - He was upset. - I know. I need to find him. Sweetheart, just take a nice deep breath and calm down. Okay, I need to find Aaron. You need to calm down and fix your tone! Come on. Sit down. Let's go. Walk. Walk! Right here. 'Sit!' but how? Good girl. - I need to talk to Aaron. - Oh, yeah, really? I think you gave up that right when you lied to him and to us. Goodness, gracious, what a disappointment you turned out to be. There are women... I thought that my Aaron had finally found the one. I was so hopeful. But then you get all caught up in your own judgements and... Women are being kidnapped! I already told you once watch your tone. Okay. We're just doing business. It's supply and demand and we're very, very good at what we do. Hey, honey. Oh, sweetheart. You lose something? Would you do me a favor? 'Could you get Reid over here, please.' of course, darling. Goodbye, Brandi. Good luck. Fiona. You're all crazy. We're business people, Brandi. Yes, we trade in an, an unorthodox product, but so what? As you can see, we've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living. And Aaron? He knows nothing. He keeps us legit by continuing to showcase the McAllister name with our generous contributions. Now, Jackie.. Jackie would probably get us six figures. You're crazy. And rich. Oh, it's a deadly combination. What do you want? I want you gone. Permanently. Aaron won't stand for that. Aaron will never know. You see, Reid has got this gift for erasing problems. - The girl in the grave... - That was my fault. She got feisty. I had to get rid of her immediately. I didn't know you had planed on going on this midnight expedition. I got rid of her the second you went whining to Aaron. Denise Dameron. Cost me $35,000. You know it's a shame that I have to get rid of you 'cause I'm sure you could fetch me a pretty penny. You'll never get away with this. Ah! You silly girl, I already have. Now we're gonna take a little trip. Okay? Move! Okay. Okay. Don't you try anything stupid, okay. Because I have no problem shooting you. - You're not my merchandise. - Help! Ah! Get Reid! Where do you think you're going, huh? You are all out of options. Brandi! I got your text. Owen! Don't! It's over, okay. - I called the police. - What? Why did you do this? Everything was fine until she spoiled you. Now look what you're making me do. Why? Why? Sometimes, Owen, you have to choose your family. I got you. It's okay. It's okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm so sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I love you. I've got you. Thank you for all the lies. - Can I ask you a favor? - Anything. Next time, can we go on vacation with my parents? Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I promise.
