If you burn this Burger King, we will never build again another restaurant in this neighborhood. Say goodbye, to our nuggets and the buffalo sauces, ranch, mustard and barbecue. Goodbye strawberry sundae, chocolate vanilla, with cookies. You consider the possibility never to take caramel sundae, strawberry and chocolate, forever! Free food! Nice! Where is it...? Where is the damn hospital? Hey, hey, excuse me! How do I get to the hospital? William! Go back to Hoover. South of Hoover. Where is Hoover? Turn left. Please open your eyes! William! William! My God, William! I don't feel his heart. What? I do not... What? Not! I don't feel his heart. Find someone! That! And then we saw two people, two drivers, who entered this area. Both drove trucks. They were taken of vehicles and beaten. Then they were robbed. When they got up... When they woke up, covered in blood and tried to escape, were beaten again. There are no police officers at the police station nor on King Avenue. The Los Angeles Police, has been ordered to leave this area. And the Tom's liquor store, near Normandie and Florence, It was totally destroyed. People came in empty handed and left carrying liquor boxes... It was almost, as if the store owner had opened the doors and let the crowd take it all... Two? Yes. Where do you live? Right here. Why did it? Do not know. Because it's free! It's free? It's. Are they back yet? Do not. They are nowhere! I searched all over the city! Are here! What? They are here! I can use this. Have you seen something like this, United States? These leather shoes? Check out my shoes, folks! How much time, will this continue? Until the jury changes its mind. Well, there it is. Alida Van Tijen, Los Angeles Live, at the corner of Western, with Santa Monica.

We came here because I saw them doing it! Not! Pay attention! I'm telling you to do something. I am giving an order. This is crazy. What is it? They were looting before to rob the bank? Okay, okay. I asked them to be quiet. I asked, with education, to close the nicks. All right? Now you are under arrest. Let's get out. What? A policeman needs reinforcement. Let's go there. No, no! No, no! Shit!
