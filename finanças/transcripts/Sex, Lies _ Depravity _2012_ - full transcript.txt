Arran: Dear Jake, I'll begin by saying sorry that it's been so long. As you may know yourself life can be hectic. Max is growing ever bigger and driving his marvelous antics but we don't mind. His recent discovery of football is his major obsession. We go and watch at the local club on Sundays while Julie cooks us splendid rice. girlfriends and kids in a normal mundane life. If I say nmundane I'm saying it in aay good way. Honest what we like for the world. We're off on a holiday next week. It's going to be great to spend some time on the beach with the family. onGet so used to travelingly. on my own for work osometimes we actually getting around holiday Julie deserves it just as does Max. She works so hard looking after him. How are you and Hannah? Still looking for a new house? I can't believe we've not all met up since the kids were born - madness in a distance and getting time off to meet does make it hard. I'm sure that Carrie and Max will get along great too. Well, better write off here. All the best to you my friend, Arran.

Hannah: We're fine. We're great. Is this going to take long, Annie? I need to go to Carrie's school. Annie: Hannah, as part of social services it's my job to come around and check on anyone any time. I don't think you understand the severity of the situation. You're a young mother with a repeated history of problems with your spouse. It's my job to make sure that Carrie is healthy and happy. Hannah: It's not really your job though, is it Annie? It's my job. I'm her mother. Annie: We're not going to go away until we see some improvements. Hannah: I don't have time for this. Annie: Well I suggest you begin to make time. I'd hate for this to become a more serious issue. mHannah: So would I. Annie: Will Jake be joining us? Hannah: He's not here. Annie: That's usually the case when I Thcome around. I really wouldI like to see Mr. Harris. I hope that we can start sorting out these issues until you're both present.

Annie: Hello Carrie, how are you? Carrie: I'm good. Mom, I need to go to school. Hannah: One minute, I'm just speaking to Annie. Hannah: I really need to go to school. Is there anything I can do for you Annie? Maybe you'd like to check Carrie for signs of abuse or psychoanalyze her before you leave? Annie: I'm just doing my job, Miss Miler. I really would like you to. speak to Mister Harris and ask him to be present. We need to sort out a family meeting soon. Hannah: Well at least you're set. We need to set up another meeting rather than turning up uninvited. Annie: Well I'll be on my way then, Hannah. I'll see myself out. Hannah: Hey. Lisa: Hey babe, are you all right? aHannah: Got a bit of time? Lisa: Always for you. Come in. So? Come on then. Out with it. Hannah: Out with what?

Hannah: Lisa I'm being serious. I haven't seen him since one am. Lisa: You never know, maybe he's left for good, happy days. Hannah: He had a bad dream Lisa: Oh, so last night he decided he was Mike Tyson and gave you a word and now he's having a Almstreet moment. You've got yourself right past that, babe. Hannah: This is serious. He's getting these bad dreams all the time, lashing out, talking to me like shit. Lisa: Why do you say then? He's cleaning up his fucking nuts. Hannah: Because we've been together since we were 18 and we have a daughter. It's more complicated than just upping and leaving. Lisa: No, you should have stayed around me mum. I would have shown you the right path to 18. shoHannah: What's that, bed 18. hopping? Lisa: Cheeky bitch. I'll have you know I may have seen a few mor beds than your but I ain't got a kid or ayour psycho for a longterm boyfriend Hannah: Maybe he's seeingfriend someone else. Lisa: Hopefully. soYou can ditch the dick andy. find yourself a real man. Did you just do that? Hannah: Yes, I did. Lisa: This is on now. Hannah: No, I'd rather go home after tea and see if he's arrived. Lisa: You're coming to the party or if you don't or she'll never forgive you. Hannah: Ooh, what a scary prospect. Lisa: Fuck off. Get up, get your coat on we're going to get pie eyed. It's only 10 in the morning How 'bout if it's 11, and by the way get up Jake: To Arran, I hope this reaches you in time before your holiday. I had a dream the other night, well more of a memory. wMe and you were about 14 and playing in the fields like we used to in the summer. It was strange looking back and thinking how we are now. Great to hear that you, Julie, and Max are well, we're fantastic as well. Hannah and I are thinking of maybe get married. We just mknow it's the next step we want to take. We barely have any arguments and you know how arguments can be. Carrie's still in school play at the moment and I'm continuing to be the good old salesman I am. bDoing really well at work,am. sold 23 cars in the last two soweeks,sure a promotion iso in the cards soon. I'm sure your job is amazing as ever. It would be nice to get away for the weekend, I haven't seen you and Julie in years now. I know me and Hannah would love to visit you. Enjoy your holiday and don't forget to send me one of those regular postcards. Take care, Jake. Hannah: You only had to ask. Jake: Just go and turn on the shower for me, would you? Hannah: How about do it yourself? Oh and one more thing what's so wrong with me? Than rather than wait for me to get back last night or spend time with me you had to go in the bedroom and went the minute you got here from wherever you've been last night? One thing I know is fuck it's to do with you? Hannah: You're sick. Jake: I've been sick of you since the day I met you. Hannah: I'm going to pick up our daughter. oI'm going to come home, put dinner on, do lunches for tomorrow, wash clothes, the usual stuff. Jake: You got to be good for something haven't you. Hannah: Well, it seems I'm the only one doing something around here. You can always try getting a job. Carrie: Mommy. Hannah: Yup. Carrie: Why are we not walking home the right way? hHannah: Because I'm going to let you stay with Auntie Lisa tonight. Carrie: Won't Daddy mind? Hannah: No, Daddy never minds. I dropped Carrie off at Lisa's. They're going to a party tonight. Lisa's nephew is having a party. She asked me earlier today if Carrie would like to go. CShe's about the same age as Greg. Greg is having a dinner with fireworks after. I thought it would be good for Carrie to meet some new Carrpeople, maybe make some friends. It beats being stuck in her bedroom all day, huh? I'll make dinner then. Lisa: Oh, you look like a really beautiful princess, Carrie. Carrie: I like my hair being done. Lisa: And I like doing your hair, sweetie. Are you ready to party? Carrie: Yes. Lisa: Good girl, I'll get our coats. Carrie: Why do cosometimes Daddy shouts at Mommy? Lisa: Because sometimes they just get angry when they're not having a very nice day. It doesn't mean they don'tay. love you though and it doesn't mean they don't love each other. Female Speaker: That means you're a woman. Ethan: Yes, fucking right, I do. Hey beautiful. Kyle: Don't do this to me again. Ethan: Don't be a fucking pussy and get me a lighter. Kyle: Where did you go the other week? Ethan: What? Kyle: When you left me here after promising me all sorts.

Ethan: Shuck time for the oyster Female Speaker: No, you're not going out. Jake: But everyone's going out. Everyone's going out on his own. Please I'll be good. Female Speaker: You're not going. And let me tell you something else. If your father was still alive, if he saw what I saw the other day he would whip the skin off your ass. Jake: I'm not doing anything wrong. Female Speaker: Who said you were doing anything wrong? You're a child trying to be an adult. adBut it doesn't work, you're too stupid to be an adult. Jake: Someone's got to be an adult. Female Speaker: And what do you mean by that? Don't start lecturing me you little shit. Fuck knows why I kept you. You're the spawn of your father. You are never going to turn out right. Jake: Mom, don't. Female Speaker: Don't what? Tell the truth, you're too young to be carrying on the way you are fucking littlee shit. Bottom line, Arran's going alone, you're staying in.

It's been two weeks. I doubt he's coming.. I hope not anyway. Lisa: If he does come back just run, dget out of the house and come to mine. Hannah: Yes. Lisa: Do you still love him? Hannah: I've been with him since we were 18, that's seven years. He's the father of my child, of course I love him. Lisa: I don't get that though after everything's he's done. Hannah: I don't get it either. HHow do you stop lovingeither. someone? Lisa: I never asked what the fuck's the use there. Hannah: What am I going to do about Carrie? Lisa: She'll be fine, she always is. And about her - you need some time. You're stressed out babe. I'll take Carrie for a pizza and sleepover. How about it? Hannah: She'd like thatt it? you're great. Lisa: All right youthen, I'll get her fromght school. Hannah: Amazing, you're a real diamond. Lisa: I know. dI'll have to drop her back in the afternoon, I've got a house party in the evening. Hannah: Oh God, messy times ahead then. Anyone I know? Lisa: He went to school with us, you wouldn't know him. he's a couple of years younger. I only know him because my I mom used to know his. my He's a bit of a troump out. Hannah: Fair play. Well have fun with your dropout mates. Lisa: Really I intend to. Jake: Arran, you should be back from your holiday by the time this reaches you. It's been about three weeks, not one bit of contact. I was thinking the other day about the old days when we were young. You remember what happened that night in my house. What was that really about? I try to work out even now, the mates really do that. My mama certainly didn't think so. I still have to live with that haunting memory of her every day. No one should have to live with that. Where's the postcard? Not like you to forget. Maybe all this time since you've been a way of keeping up with your old friend this time. I like to think not or maybe Julie's keeping you away. She never did like me. And to be honest maybe we can drop the act now. I didn't fucking like her either. heI'm surprised you've been together just as long as me and Hannah. From the age of 16 Julia drop her I suppose you never saw the video of her touching your vimate Ben's cock in theur youth conf in 2005. She had only been 17. Shes got seedy little past madam maybe you should ask her about that one day. Well I'm sending her one big fat fucking regards. Maybe then you could also man up and tell her you're coming to visit me and shut her mouth before you teach her a good lesson and show her what a cunt you really can be. Because let's face it Arran, you are one, one massive lie and sanctimonious cunt, sending me your letters about your fantastic home life, showing off and being holier than though in each and every one. So let's cut the bullshit, Hannah's a drag, a big old fucking drag. I find her about as attractive as a piece of shit. She leaves in my house, she eats my food, makes shit dinners, and all I've really wanted to do is die so I can have my peace and quiet. Without columber carry off from someone else too and be the person I want to be. I mean I'm no family man but neither are you really. nYou spend most of the year travelling far and wide and the big off with girlfriend and child. I suppose this arrangement suits you all well. Because let me tell you bezzy when you run out of the big bucks your misses most deeping cocks most nights but you know mit's the perfect day today. I'm sure your business trips to Thailand must be your favorite. What did you do? Work and spend the rest of the trip on some stereotypical store and getting noshed off by Thai guy. You're a fucking shit, Arran, and I'm fucsure your wife wouldd I'm relish and trip if she knew it. So I reckon within a week I'll get your reply. Well, I'm going to stop doing some talking. Sincerely yours and fucked off, Jake. So subtle you are. Start talking or I'll slice your fucking throat. Carla: What do you want? Jake: Why are you following me? meCarla: To see where you worked. Jake: Why? Carla: Because I am. Ethan wanted to see where you worked. I told him about the picture in your wallet and must have gotten him thinking. Jake: I need you to go quietly, you're going to go home, you're going to pack your bags, and fuck off. Carla: I'm not leaving. Jake: You're going home, you're going to pack your bags, and don't say anything to Ethan because if you do I've got your number. All the clubs you set foot in right up to the hilts. Do you understand? Carla: Yes. Jake: Fuck off. Hannah: Who's this? Annie: Hannah, could you open the door please? It's Annie. Hannah: Annie, can you come back another day? I'm not very well. Annie: This won't take long. wOpen the door please. Hannah: Please. I'll ring you and we can set another day. Annie: Open the door, Miss Miller. We will come back later and open it by force if we have to. What the hell's happened? Hannah: I had an accident. Annie: Oh Hannah, you think I haven't heard that before? Hannah: Well you can believe whatever you want. wHave you seen my cut site? Annie: Well no, I can't say I have. Hannah: Well that's because it's written up so you carry it's on making your wildarry assumptions. Annie: Do you want to talk about it? Hannah: Not really. Annie: Is Carrie around?ally. Hannah: She's in school, you know, that was one of the targets you sent me, to make sure she's attending. Annie: Is Mr. Harris around? Hannah: We split up. Annie: Oh really? Hannah: Yes, really. Annie: What brought this on? AHannah: Things haven't been working out and he's met someone else. Annie: You expect me to believe that? I come around here you're covered in bruises, some wild story about an accident, and you're telling me you've split up. Hannah: We have, asked around. None of our neighbors would have seen him for two weeks either. Besides, they can usually hear the arguments. thI bet they'll tell you it's been quiet as anything. They're having a wonderful time. Annie: Well I'll have to take some more information from you, Hannah. Hannah: Go ahead, I'm all ears. Ethan: Carla. Carla. Carla did you follow Jake? Carla: Yes, it's alright that we woke em up then. Ethan: What are you doing? Carla: I'm going to my Mom's a bit. I'm taking the jeep. The police are on to me, I've got to take it out to be safe. gEthan: You ain't taking oure. whole supply. Carla: Well the police will find everything here. Ethan: So go ahead, who's on to us? Carla: Ethan, I haven't got time for this, just let me go. Ethan: You haven't got time because you're fucking lying. Carla: Okay, fine, I'll take my half and go. Ethan: What's the rush? Carla: Ethan, I'm going, just leave it. lNow don't tell anyone where I'm going especially your fucking bum buddy. Now I didn't say this but he's got a locker on the industrial stage that's where he went today. Don't ask him about it because he'll know that I fucking told you. Hannah: Why did you turn up this morning? I needed to shoot myself Lisa: What? She actually bought your story? Hannah: Yes. Lisa: Bullshit. I can't believe she did for a minute. Hannah: Well she left after she took some notes. Lisa: Why did you tell her, Hannah? Hannah: Scared I guess. Lisa: Scared of what? Hannah: They'll take Carrie away. I look at her and actually I feel I achieved something in life like most parents do I suppose. I've been spat on, beaten down, used but after all that I have my little girl. Lisa: And you always will, gorgeous. Don't forget your friends either. Hannah: Of course, I would be no one without you. I'm going to make a move now. aYou okay to have Carrie over? Lisa: Of course it is, any time babe. Hannah: She loves seeing you. Give me a chance to sort the house out. Lisa: Yes. Go, relax, stop worrying all the time, woyou're a free bird now. Hannah: Okay. Carrie. Give Mommy a hug. She's going now. Be good to Auntie Lisa. Lisa: That I am. So Carrie what do you think of fish and chips? Carrie: Yehey. Hannah: Let's go. Ethan: looking pretty good out there Kyle: What do you want, Ethan? Ethan: Just came to see how you were shaping up. Kyle: Well I come here to get away from everything including you. Ethan: Thanks. Kyle: What do you want me to say? You pick me up and put me down as you please. You know how I feel and you just don't care. Ethan: I never said I didn't. care. Kyle: Why do you what you do if you care? I don't know who put it in your head that made you think you're so desirable. You live for the drugs, the potties, the showing around, living in some shit flat basically going nowhere int life yet you think you're this great person, the life and soul of the party but you're not Ethan, you're a mess. And the only one who sees past your bullshit façade is me. So you're just walking away again instead of giving me an answer once and for all? You always want to start this but you never want to finish it. I know you want me really but you told me to forget it a long time ago. Ethan: You don't know the shit you talk about. Kyle: I know you feel for me. What are you doing here? You're here to keep the piece of string I'm hanging on going. Ethan: I came here to watch a friend and how the friend was doing. And if you must know I've met someone. I may not have a lot but at least I'm not some fucked up poor little lonely rich boy. Kyle: I'd rather be lonely and a good person than popular, a liar, a thief, and a junkie. Hannah: Where have you been Jake? Jake: Out, stayed with some friend. Hannah: What are you talking about? You haven't got any friends. Jake: Okay. Hannah: Look I don't want any trouble. Jake: You got in trouble when you opened that big fucking mouth of yours. Hannah: I think I paid my dues for that. Jake: You're only just starting to pay. I need money. Hannah: I haven't got any. Jake: You lying bitch. Hannah: So what are you going to do? Rob me and leave Carrie Jake: Carrie's at Lisa's, isn't she? Hannah: No, she's at my Mom's. Jake: You're lying, Hannah. I told you to stay here and leave everyone else out of it. Hannah: Stay here?

Thanks for telling me though. I just want Ethan to be okay. ILisa: Sorry babe, just give. yourself two months to stay there. Carla: It's a pretty small world, ain't it.

Ethan: Did she? Is she all right? Lisa: To be honest Ethan and no offense Jake I don't think she gives a dick about you. Ethan: Yes, well that'st you. fucking too bad cuz none of us fare about to here he fuckings child ass some off. Lisa: So what do you do for a living Jake? Jake: I'm unemployed at the moment.

Julie: You doing all right. Arran: I'm fine. Julie: Arran please talk to me. mIt's not like you mopping around and being all secretive. Arran: I'm not the one being secretive Julie. Julie: And what's that supposed to mean? Arran: You had it off with Ben. AJulie: Sorry? Arran: Ben, myn. friend who works with books fyou hit it off with him.ks Julie: Have you completely lost your mind? What are you talking about? Youth club? Arran: Just tell me. Julie: I haven't been to a youth club in eight or so years. Why are we talking about it? Arran: Because I want to know. Julie: I wasn't even with you when I was 17. What does it matter? Arran: So that's a yes then? How many other guys did you fuck before we met? Julie: Don't swear at me. Since when do you do that? Arran: Since I got pissed off with the lies. I bet you even have guys up here when I'm away on my trips. You do, don't you? Julie: Of course I don't. Arran: Until today, Julie, don't you ever, ever do anything against me. Slapper! Julie: How dare you. Hold the fucking just a minute. You think I'm some mindless little housewife and mother? I've seen more than you think and I sealways have. Jake wrote youI and told you this, don't deny it. He never could stand me, stand our happiness. stHe hated me from the day we. met at the club. He latched on to Hannah because she was my best friend and he knew that he could stay close to you by being with her. Arran: Finished? You know nothing. What you think you know you don't. You know nothing. Julie: Arran, I know, I've always known. He was the bastard who comes out of the middle of nowhere. Julie: Please. Arran: He's the bastard you fuck his brains out! Fuck. Where did you do it? Here? Here? Are you quite happy to suck him up in our bed, fucking bed? Ethan: Roll over. Heather: Ethan, hi Ethan, I've got a bit of a problem thing. Ethan: What's that? Heather: I've got a really itchy punnit. Ethan: Yes, I loved the way you scratched earlier in your fucking crops. Jake: Get out, we need to chat. Lisa: I'd be delighted. Jake: Go home, Lisa, go home and you won't be a part of this. Lisa: I am a part of this Jake. Carla told me everything. She told me you wereg. gay, and you bullshit about your secret locker and how you bullshit your way past Ethan. I didn't take him for no muff I but you played him alonguff perfectly. Jake: Go home. Lisa: Carrie's back at home and wondering why her mom's got a black eye. You never think, do you? Jake: What did you tell her? Lisa: Nothing, I told her nothing. Back off Jake, I told her nothing. I bloody should have though but I knew you'd break her fucking heart if she knew you had fucked your way into another house. Jake: Fuck off. anoLisa: What's your problemf. Jake? You bloody bent? Is that why you go around beating up women because you can't deal with the fact that you've got nothing more than a cock up your ass? You hit me, you even try, and I'll scream. I'll scream this fucking street down and everyone inside will know. I'll tell them, you know I will. Jake: Shut your fucking mouth you jumped up little whore. Then I'll give you Ben and. I'll fuck you right here now. Your mate is trying to come on to me, she's undone my belt. Ethan: You dirty fucking cunt. Lisa: Bumf now aren't you Jake LisEthan: Will you fuck off?ke Lisa: But - Ethan: Fuck off. Let me tell you, you better have your fucking bags packed and fuck off out of my house, you stupid cunt. Heather: You all right, Ethan? Ethan: Go. EtHeather: Ethan, I'm staying the night. Ethan: Go. tHeather: I've got all my stuff. Ethan. Ethan: Get out. call me back if you get this. Jake's fucking lost it and Hannah's not in a good way. Hannah: I thought I heard voices out here. What the fuck is going on? Why are you shaking so much? Lisa: Is Carrie in bed?? Hannah: Of course she is, it's nearly midnight. What's going on? Lisa: I haven't been telling you everything. Hannah: About? Lisa: Look, we haven't got time for this. Get Carrie and we're going. Hannah: Would you slow down? I'm not getting Carrie out and I'm not going anywhere until you talk to me. Lisa: Let's do this now. Just get Carrie and a bag. Hannah: I've got time Lisa, I'm not going anywhere. Lisa: I've seen Jake. Hannah: Where? Where? Lisa where's my boyfriend? Lisa: Have you got a drink or something? Hannah: Lisa. Lisa: Don't hate me. I had to make sure it was the right Jake. I had to make sure it was him before I told you. Hannah: Told me what? Lisa: He's living and fucking some bloke and to make matters worse he's already kicked the other lodger out of the house. He's manipulated everyone. He's just thick. He's been fucking some bloke and feeding him bullshit to keep all of this a secret. And to make matters worse the bloke he's with is only 21. bHannah: You're lying. Lisa: What? Hannah: I appreciate that he's not perfect. In fact he's a womanizing violent shit bag. But he ain't gay, I appreciate that you're trying the best, I mean trying to get me to leave him but there's just no way. Lisa: Lady, would you see fucking sense. He's beating you black and blue and now he's off taking out this shit every night and if that isn't enough for you, if Ethan hadn't been listening to our conversation Jake would have raped me tonight. Jake: Ethan. Ethan: Go back to the block, get your stuff, and fuck off. Jake: Everything's a mess, you don't understand. Ethan: Oh I understand too well. Jake: You can help me, the anger, it's always been there, I can't help it. Ethan: Oh you want my help? Jake: Yes, everyone that's ever cared about me is gone. As far back as I can remember I've never ever had anything I've ever wanted. Ethan: Oh woe you, we all come from nothing, how are we ever meant to achieve anything but we get by and we will spend our lives getting by. I don't need you and I don't need anybody. Fuck off. Lisa: I rang Julie and I left a message. Once they know they'll be down here sorting all this shit. Hannah: You rang Julie? YoHow much did you say? Lisa: Enough Hannah: You just killed me. Lisa: You what? Hannah: Out of everything Jake didn't want Julie and Arran to know about our problems. Lisa: Aren't they? Fucking ashamed is he? Hannah: You were mad at me, they'll fucking flip. Lisa: It's about time someone did something to stop this all. Hannah: Please leave, Lisa. You've done enough. Ethan: Who do you think you are coming around here staying my place and then taking the fucking piss out of me like that? Well you can get fucked. Get fucking fucked. And Carla, where the fuck are you Carla? Where the fuck are you... How'd you know who I am? You may be fucking Jake but you know who I am, huh? I'll tell you who I am, [screaming]. Hannah: How did this all happen anyway? Lisa: Hannah, I thought I was doing what was best. Hannah: Oh yes, how the fuck did you become so involved anyway? Lisa: Involved? How the fact did I ask to be involved you mean? Who's been helpin the kid Hannah? Who's been at your beck and call worrying, wondering when the day's going to come when I find out that he's killed you? Involved? You involved me. Hannah: Just get out. getI don't want to see you anymore. see Lisa: This is far from over girl. You'll realize that soon enough. You think Jake's not coming back? He'll be back soon and you'll take him back like the monkey you are. bHe the father of my child,e. something you'll probably never understand until you get your own one. Lisa: You're talking like a real beaten housewife now. Hannah: Get out. [1 week later] Arran: Jake, I know you're not at home right now, I'm not sure when you're coming back. We've been in touch with Hannah, making sure she's okay, checking on Carrie too. I don't know what's happened down there, I'm still finding out digest her myself. Since your letter arrived it seems my life has been turned upside down. You can be satisfied with one thing -- Julie and I are not getting on well. Much more has surfaced since your letter and much as I hate to admit it you turned out to be right. You don't have to be scared of me Jake, it isn't you anymore. mI don't know how you got into this most trouble. Lots of people are getting caught up in this, so far maybe even more than that. You've risked a lot of people's safety, you've turned everything inside out. In fact Jake I'll never forgive you for it. In case this is the first thing you pick up when you get back I'll spell things out. You're not the only one gone, so is Lisa. Hannah in spite of everything stood by you and the night you left Lisa left too. God knows where she's gone. I hope she's safe. She's probably running because of fear. I hope this isn't the case. You already know where she is. Hannah told me what Lisa had said about where you've been staying, if that's true, if that's really how you felt, if you actually did really liked this guy. Why didn't you just say? you've strung her along. just be honest with her. Maybe I feel a certain amount of guilt too. I remember when we were young and maybe I'd acted different andthen this wouldn't haveent happened. It really isn't too late to make things right with Hannah, Lisa, maybe if you have any friends too. But for me sadly it's too late Jake. I love Julie so, so much, and I want to try to make things work. I don't want to spend the whole of my life being bitter and holding the mistake against here. I don't think we'll ever see each other again, Jake, if you become to unpridictable I hope you try and work out if we came face to face with each other. Unfortunately I don't think I can ever face that. All the best Jake, please make things right, Arran. Carla: Be over to come cry again? Ethan: You look fucking different. Carla: I'd say the same thing to you. Ethan: Can I come in then? Carla: This is my mom's house, Ethan, I don't even know if she's in here. Ethan: Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle in my eye, [mumbling] Wow, Miss Hart, you are looking hot. Carla: Ethan, you promised. Ethan: All right, don't get menstrual. Carla: Jake been back? Ethan: Yes. YCarla: Have you seen Kyle? Ethan: No. Carla: When are you going to sort all this out then? soEthan: I'm working on it. Carla: How's that? Ethan: I'll need the address of that locker. Carla: Ethan let it go. Don't you want to go have a look at the place. Once I've done that I can put all of this behind me. You're a star. Carla: Well that's my name then. Ethan: Looking different, I'll give you that. Carla: Is that a joke? Ethan: Yes, who are you kidding? Carla: I'm serious, Ethan, I don't want to live how we were living anymore, waiting for the next party or the next batch to come along, wouldn't have been long until one of us was dead. You're my best friend Ethan but even you are showing the signs. Ethan: What signs? WhCarla: The signs that somebody's washed up your shadow of what you used to be. sYou should make your peacebe. with Kyle and then he'd give you what he's always wanted to give you. Ethan: What'sd that? Carla: Don't joke Ethan, I'm serious. You need to clean yourself up, clean that place up, and go report to Kyle. Ethan: You didn't really like Jake, didn't you. Carla: Yes, I didn't. Ethan: Anyway, I'm going to crack off but well done. You've done well. Say goodbye to your sexy assed mama for me. See you. Adam, I need a favor. I need you to run some figurative elect row for me. A guy named Jake Harris, lives in Milton Kings. iCool. Yes, I know, just text me. mI'll be around all day. All right, cheers baby. Arran: Are you okay? Julie: Yes, I'm fine. Arran: I finished the last letter today. I'm not communicating with Jake anymore. Julie: Good, we'll just keep an eye on Hannah for a while, yes? Arran: Yes. Julie: Hasn't Lisa's phone call changed your mind about him? Arran: Changed a lot. Julie: I can't believe that it all happened. I can't believe I wasn't there. Arran: It's not your fault. Julie: It's my fault. I hadn't even called Hannah. Not once, not even once. Arran: The friends you had then are not the friends you need now. Julie: I didn't have Hannah. Arran: Don't feel -- Julie: sometimes change me Arran: It's not your fault. What could you have done? What could you have changed? Julie: A lot. Arran: We didn't know Jake was bad. We didn't know this, maybe this bad. Julie: Did you know? Did you know that he was bad? Arran: Of course I knew that he was bad but I didn't know he was this bad. Julie: You always defended him. Arran: I'm not defending him. I didn't know it would turn out. Julie: I told you. I always said it, you never listened to me. You never listened. Arran: Yes I cared, I know that you cared. I thought he might work his way out, I thought he might come through, I thought he might change a few things but when I saw that he wasn't I knew we had to get away. We don't need people like that to take our path. tI know this is horrible, this had to happen. Jake had to break free, Jake had to become whatever he was going to become. He can change. Julie: It doesn't make me feel better. dArran: It mustn't make you. feel better. It's a bad thing but one that he deserves. We're going to be okay. Julie: Are you sure? Arran: Yes, I'm sure. Come here. I'm not going to let Jake destroy our lives, okay? Julie: Okay. Arran: Okay. We're going to be all right, me and you and Max, we're all right. This is our destiny. I'm so sorry. Julie: I know. Female Speaker: Jake? Jake: What are you doing? Mom? It's just one bottle. It makes any difference a few other times. How can I trust you can get there? Female Speaker: I'm going to do it. I know I've said it. I know I've said it before, I mean it this time. What I said to you the other day. I'm sorry. Jake: It's okay. Female Speaker: I'm going to need your help though, okay? I can't do it on my own. Jake: Love you. I'm going to stick with you all the way. Female Speaker: Okay. Will you help me do it? Jake: Let's stick together. Female Speaker: Cheers. Ethan: Hannah, right? Hannah: Ethan I presume? Ethan: Can I come in? Nice kid. Hannah: She doesn't have a father. Ethan: How'd you know who I was? Hannah: Lisa told me I didn't know what to believe but then you show up so I suppose it must be true. Ethan: I didn't know about you or about the kid or that anyone knew Lisa. I just thought Jake was some gay guy at the club worth picking up. Hannah: What can I do for you Ethan? Ethan: Have you seen Jake? Hannah: No, I haven't, and I wasn't expecting us to meet. How did you know where Ieet. lived? Ethan: I've got a mate that does the electrical work. thI ran it by him. Hannah: So. you're after him? Ethan: Not after him to search but I'm not going to take an injustice lying down. I want to know where he keeps his locker? Hannah: His what? Ethan: Did he ever used toat? leave the house a lot in the day, during the middle of the night? Hannah: Carry on. Ethan: I had someone follow him one day to an industrial state not far from here. He has a locker there and that's where he's spending every day. Hannah: That's all new to me. Ethan: Do you have the key for it? Hannah: I don't have one. itEthan: Do you think Jake's. coming back? Hannah: I don't think it, I know he'll be back. Ethan: You need to get the key from him when he comes back. He keeps it in his backpack. Hannah: How do you know that? Ethan: Because he's left mine every day with the backpack and he had it with him the night he left. iThere's a key in there and I. need your help to get it. If he comes back you grab the key, get out and come to me. Hannah: What about myme. daughter? Ethan: Has she got somewhere she can stay? Hannah: My mom's but I'm not going to bring her there waiting for Jake to come home. Ethan: I need your help withe. this. It's the only way we can find out what's going on. Hannah: Why should I trust you? tYou were fucking my boyfriend for three weeks, putting him up, while I usually laid in a puddle of my own blood. Ethan: You know what? I don't think you've got a lot of choice but to trust me or you are never going to know the truth. nHannah: I don't trust you at. all. I'm only going to go along with it because I'm curious what I'm going to find. Lisa told me all about you. You're just some low life, jobless drug dealer with a very sick attitude. Ethan: Yes, you're probably not far wrong there. Hannah: Fuck off. Get out. Kyle: What happened to you? Ethan: Nothing happened to me, I feel real good. I Kyle: That's not what your hands and face say. Ethan: Don't worry about that. Come around. Kyle: What? Ethan: Tomorrow come around. We'll have a cozy little kiss, I'll make some dinner, it will be good. Kyle: You've lost me completely now. Ethan: Show up. I fucking love you. What the fuck are they doing? Kyle: It's horrible. He's a back coach right now. Ethan: I can see his nuts through his trousers. You've got to be fucking joking. Kyle: Stop being mean. Ethan: Somebody needs to tell him to put it away because I'm getting horny just looking at it. Kyle: Why are you always so mean? yEthan: I'm not mean. Look. Kyle: You are. Ethan: I can see his fucking helmet. Kyle: What happened in your childhood that made you so corrupt? Tell me. Ethan please, please Ethan. Ethan: You want to know? Kyle: Yes. Ethan: You know what? I always grew up in the city and my mom she didn't have a lot of money so all the kids would come in with their trainers and they're all so cool and me I was just dressed like a shit all the time. And you know they were fuckers a lot of them. a There was one day I walked from school and I just got beat on every week and shit like that. Shit happens and they used to spit on me, push me around, throw me to the ground, and I remember one lunch time I was just standing out in the park minding my own business and they just stopped me, called me queer, threw me about once again, same old same old shit. And there was this one guy, fucking George was his name. fYou know what I did? Kyle:. What? Ethan: I just struck at him. I just had it that day. jI just stuck the shit out of him. And I said from that day forward no one was ever going to see me at my weakest again, not you, not Carla, not my prick Jake or anyone. myI'm getting back. No one's ever going to make me look like a mug again. But you seem to do a whole lot of asking. You don't seem to do a lot of telling. How come you're down here every day and not in front Kyle: It gives me a sense of relief. When I have tough times, when I have troubles in my life I come here and just let myself go. I just - the feeling when you're in the ice is just great. You forget the whole world, you just - theverything is in your own little world and it just relaxes me. Ethan: What do you hope to escape from rich boy? Kyle: It's different. Out there you just - it feels like you're flying. Nothing and no one can hurt you, you just feel with one with yourself. It's just amazing. Ethan: Fair enough. I reckon we need to go and get some dinner before that guy gets a stiffy. Kyle: Stop that. Stop it. Come on. Female Speaker: Jake where are you going? Jake: Just out. yoFemale Speaker: With Arran? Jake: Yes. Female Speaker: I'd rather you didn't. Jake: Mom I've got plans. Female Speaker: I'd rather you didn't leave this house. dJake: Please don't shout at me. Female Speaker: I'm your mother, you will listen to me. If I say you're not going out you're not. Please go back upstairs. Jake: You've been off the booze for Ya couple of weeks you decide you're a mother all of a sudden. Female Speaker: Upstairs. Jake: No, get back come away for a couple of months then I'll start taking orders. Female Speaker: Just like your father, you know that. fJake: Don't start with this again. Female Speaker: Fine, fuck off then. If you want to repay me for my hard work by going out with that stupid old shit friend of yours then go ahead. Jake: I was planning too anyway. Jake: Surprise. Hannah: Not really. I knew you'd be back. Jake: Where's my letter? Hannah: Very impressive Jake: I wasn't. Arran: I don't think we'll ever see each other again, Jake. You've become too predictable and over and over in my mind I'm trying to recount what it would be like if we came face to face with each other. Jake: Mom? Drunk as a skunk again. Arran: You're just going to leave her there? Jake: Yes, she'll sober up, start again. Jesus, just wat she dropped Arran: Sandra. Jake? Jake: What? Arran: She's not breathing. Jake: What?

Kyle: Ethan this is all I've ever wanted you know? It hasn't been easy with Mom and Dad lately. wIf it wasn't for the ice skating I'm sure they would have given me the boot. I don't know what the problem is with everyone. I'm just trying to be me and I end up being blamed for it. Ethan: You're not lonely anymore, are you? Kyle: You sure? Ethan: Sure. Can I get a fucking hug? Arran: You're not into this, are you? Julie: No. Arran: Not right now. Julie: I'm afraid not. I'I'm still thinking of my friend you know. Arran: You've got to stop. They're not our responsibility anymore, you know? We've got to get on with our lives. Julie: What about their daughter. Arran: She'll be fine. Julie: I really want to forget this all but it's difficult. thArran: I'm not going back. there. I'm not going back. Don't know what I'm going down to Julie: I'm not asking you to. I don't want to go there myself. Arran: We've got to forget. Julie: I'm trying. I'm trying, okay? I'll try. Ethan: This is about the queerest thing we've ever done. Kyle: Nice there, huh? Ethan: You not sure how to split You're not doing drugs in my house. Ethan: call up a sports thing ma EthanKyle: Like what? Ethan:g ma Anything. Kyle: Well all I've ever wanted to be was an ice skater. Whenever I'm hurt or someone hurts me or I argue with mom I always go down to the rink and skate and all mye troubles just seem to go away. Like I become this powerfulay. person and no one in the world can touch me. Does that do? Ethan: Yes. Kyle: What about you? Ethan: What about me?

Kyle: Ethan, don't get into any trouble. Ethan: This is something I've got to do. I want you to remember - Kyle: What? WEthan: I love - Kyle: I love you. Ethan: I fucking love you too. Remember that. What the fuck is this? Hannah: All I know is it started when Jake found his mom dead when he was 15. She was a serious alcoholic. Everyone knew it. She was always running to shops embarrassing Jake when she just fell out of some pub or another. Jake had to live with everyone knowing their business. Ethan: Well it's just some fucking shrine. Hannah: Maybe we should leave you know. Ethan: Hannah do the fucking job at hand. Something's going on and I've want to get to the bottom of it. Hannah: Why can't you? Ethan: Because I don't know who Arran is. We're not leaving. Hannah: I'm getting a bit pissed off taking some orders from some lousy man... Ethan: No wonder you just let your boyfriend beat you. So get on with that. How is it going? Hannah: You know he's kept a copy of every letter he wrote to Arran as well. Ethan: Shit, that's fucking wrong. Hannah: Well I think it's clear that Jake feels a little bit more emotional about Arran than I thought. aboYou know there neverght. round here but this fucking stuff of Arran's do Ethan? Ethan: probably leave and never come back. Hannah: He's not fucking well. Ethan: Well done, Einstein. Hannah: He needs help. Ethan: He needs to be checked into an asylum. Jake: This is where it ends. Now you know. NoEthan: Now we know you're fucking psycho. Jake: Why are you sneaking around, Ethan? You got your wrist stamped on, you got dumped. I don't think you're important to this story. toEthan: I'm not important to this story? Well the fact that you stayed with me for three weeks and fucking rump me while you left here beaten and the kid home not important that you're taking the piss. Jake: Let me tell you how I. look at it. You're not clever or smart or streetwise. You're just a condescending mouthy little prick and if you thought for one second I looked at you at that club and thought how stunning you were you're fucking wrong webecause I can't stand the sight of you. You're everything that's plain and boring about this world. Ethan: What did you do Jake? ETurn me around, do me from? behind - did you think this now, did you call out in your head while you were giving it to me? Jake: You fucking cunt. Hannah: Jake, I don't want any trouble. trJake: You've got fucking trouble. You fucking ruined everything. Arran is never going to speak to me again and it's all because of you. That's it, fucking postcards all fucked because of you, alfucking queer, shitty ass whore of a girlfriend. Ethan: You know what? I nearly fell for you but I can't believe I nearly fucking fell for you, you little fuck. Jake: You want to watch your mouth you dirty time wasting pot smoker How about I tell you you're an asshole? Would you like that? assEthan: You fucking little? repressed fuck Jake: Arran was there for me when my mom died and then you and Judy came along and fucked everything up. Hannah: Do I truly deserve all of these confusing names? oDid I have thought to deserve all of these? aThat Ethan neither deserved this. What was going on with that Ethan anyway? Jake: It was the day I needed somewhere to crash. someHannah: I don't think you all in musty Jake: I don't give a fuck what you think? Hannah: Do you know where Lisa is? Jake: No, but I know she called Arran. Hannah: You know no matter what I would have never ever Jake: But your stupid big board mate did though, didn't she? Ethan: Come on. Hannah: What the fuck are we going to do? Ethan: Look, we're going to get out of here. It's nearly daylight. Come on. Hannah: Jake please don't hurt me. I want to be there for Carrie, I want to go with her to her wedding day and tell her how beautiful she looks. Don't take that away from her. DoDon't give her bad memories. please. We can sort this out. Please. Jake: It's funny how we all end up, isn't it? Here one day, next six feet under. Never breathe fresh air again, see the sunset, full human embrace. Arran: Jake, what happened to your mom it wasn't your fault. yoJake: Then why does it feel. like it was? Why do I feel so selfish. She was trying to give up booze. And I was just being a bastard. AShe was my mom, not what shed. did, what she said. She's my mom. I loved her like I love you. You're the brother I never had. She even thought I was meant for you. Arran: What? Jake: She was obsessed of that but she doesn't get me like you do. You know how I feel, I was hurt, and no one else gets her. You're my brother, Arran, the brother I never had. Arran: And you'll always be mine Jakie Boy Jake: Arran, things haven't been good and they've only just got worse. By the time you read this letter none of this will be relevant anymore and I even know that by now you weren't - I'd like you to think back to the days we were drinking beer in the fields near my house, that's how I remember us. I never got to make up for the things I've done but now that they're done I seem to be thinking more clearly than ever and I csuppose it's time for the honesty. I've missed you so much for these last few years and I've done some terrible things. How I've managed to become obsessed with what I have I will never know. A long time ago I told you you were my brother, you always have been. Just recently people tried to turn this into something else, tlike some homosexual fixation with you, but it isn't, it never has been. My life has been spent living for you because you were my strength, my friend, the keeper of my darkest secrets. Nothing would describe how much of a part my soul left that day you did. I felt like every bit of strength I've ever built would blow away. You gave me the courage to meet Hannah and build a life with her in the early days and the courage to make it past my mom's death. The guilt I felt ever since no one could ever truly understand. Still as I write this today I know that if I hadn't left that night my mom would have actually made it through. I've had no one but you my whole life, that's the reason I've made it by. What I've done is terrible, you won't understand, no one will understand, and maybe I myself won't ever understand either. The rays that burn inside me never seems to leave and I'll never figure out why I do the things I do until they're done. I can't apologize to Hannah now or to my daughter who I've loved through everything. I've hurt a lot of people who never needed to be part of this situation. I can't even tell you what's going on with Ethan but if you should speak to him send him my regards. senI'm simply envying him in every way. He may have nothing but one thing he does have is fight and determination. I can never be as strong or as loud or as sociable as him and his talent's very far and wide as he'll ever understand. Hannah was always weak but I admire her for standing by me. adIt hasn't done her any good. but I'll always love her although I've never shown it to her and what I've done is another thing I should never figure out. And that's why being the selfish person I am I'm never going to try. And you Arran, my friend, my brother, I felt betrayed when you left, maybe even a little bit jealous but you're a successful guy and you did everything you ever dreamed of. In spite of how selfish this is, the one person I truly never wanted to hurt was you. nYou stood by me since Day 1. and tried to help me past everything I've ever gone through but you can't help someone in my place no matter how hard you try. Please check in on Carrie time after time for me. Her future's uncertain now and I'm not going to worry about it. I've confessed everything in this letter and when it's found out this circle of lies and violence and dissent can now end. I love you my brother. Jake.
