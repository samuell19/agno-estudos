[MUSIC - DAVID KREIGEL, "LOVE DON'T COME EASY"] THEME SONG: What's not to love? Well, I wonder if I'll ever get the hang of you. I used to think that I was something 'cause I've been around the block a time or two. I used to not have a care in the world, till the day I was caught chasing all the pretty girls. Because love, love, love don't come easy. I never knew the places where hot monkey love could take ya. Was a train I did not want to ride. It always looked like fun for just a little while. -Good evening. -Hi, I'm Nikki Shore I'm here to meet the Global Water people. -Right this way, Miss Shore. NIKKI (VOICEOVER): Oh, shit It's only me and the ferocious Fifi. -It's just you and me tonight. The others had to fly back to Europe to circumvent some crisis or other. Champagne? You know, uh. It's not easy parting ways with an agency after 20 years. -Well, I understand that, but they have consistently kept you at number two. If you come with Wiggin and Nori, I will personally guarantee Global Water will be number one worldwide. -Really? And how do you propose to do that? -I will eat, sleep, and breathe Global. -That's what we're counting on. Congratulations. -You won't regret it. -I better not. Delicious. Isn't it? -Mhm. -Business aside, let's get to know each other better. Is there, um, anyone special in your life? -No. -Give us a moment, Michael. -Certainly, Ms. Taylor. -I, um, took the liberty of ordering for you. I hope that's all right. -Oh, it's fine. -Now, where was I? Oh, yes. What do you like to do for fun? -I work. -Don't worry about it. You've got the account. I like your smile -Thank you. -I've always been so insecure about mine. -Why? You have a great smile. -So sweet of you to say that. -It's true. -You know, you-- you have a little bit of something right-- -Oh. -Oh, you don't have to be coy with me. -No, I'm sorry. I just think you misunderstood me. -Oh, I don't think so. You're driving me crazy. -Ms. Taylor, please. I'm not gay. -Oh, right. -Ms. Taylor, please. You know what? This is really very awkward, and I, I think-- -Just, just let me rub up against you. It will only take a moment. Just put it down, Michael! I'm sorry. I've just been a little horny lately. -Oh, no. It's fine. I completely understand. -To Global? -To Global. -How are you doing today, Nikki? -Couldn't be better. -Great. -Hey, Chloe. -Hey, Nikki. -Hey, Duncan. -Hey, how'd it go last night? -How do you feel about a view of the Charles? -Sweet. -Hey, would you grab me a cup of coffee? -How many have you had so far? -Five, six. -Oh, OK. -Thanks. MR. WIGGIN: Where's Nikki Shore? -Mr. Wiggin? -If you were a guy, I'd tell you to keep your dick in your pants. -What? -I don't care if you want to diddle every woman in this city-- just don't do on my time. -I, I don't know what you're talking about. You're scaring me. -You damn well ought to be scared. I just got off the phone with Fifi. She's ready to sue both of us. -Uh. It wasn't like that! She's the one that hit on me. -All I know is we lost a $50 million account last night. -What was I supposed to do? Sleep with her? -For $50 million? I'd have my own mother go down on her. You're done. Out of the office, and clean your stuff out. -Y-you, you've gotta be kidding me. -Do I look like I'm kidding? -No, but-- Mr. Wiggins, I mean, I have busted my ass for you. You can't just-- -Boo hoo. Go. Go play it on somebody else. NIKKI (VOICEOVER): Do not cry. No tears. For God's sake, be a woman Why does he have to look at me like that? Shit. Keep it together. BRIANNA: I so need your advice. So-- tonight's the night we're doing it. You have to tell me how. -With Justin? -Of course, with Justin. -Well, you have had ten boyfriends this year. -Not like Justin. -Does your mom know you're planning on doing it? -She doesn't care. Now I need specifics. So-- now, when I put my tongue in his mouth, how far do I go in? -Inch, inch and a half. -An inch and a half? Do I poke it in and out, or swirl it around? -Why don't you poke it in and out once, and then do that swirly thing? -Now, what about moaning? Do I want a lot or a little? I heard guys like to know you like. -Getting them off. You know what's the most important thing, though? Is the block. You gotta keep your elbows down at your sides. You can move your hands, just make sure your elbows remain locked at all times. Wandering hands, you know. -Oh, good. Yeah. I need you to me a big, big favor. My mom has a date tonight, and my uncle is staying the weekend. I told you how strict and uptight he is. I want to get rid of him for an hour, so Justin can come over. So would you let him come over and give you a massage? -Ha! I'm not going to let your uncle give me a massage. -That's his job. -I'll pay for it. -With what? -Please. -Fine. I can use a massage. Just tell him to come over at six. -Thank you. Thank you! -Love you, bye bye. -Love you, bye bye. -Be careful. -I will. [SIGHS] -Oh, sorry. NIKKI: Hey. Hi. -Hi. I'm Thadius, Bri's uncle. -Come on in. Do you, uh, need help with something? -Oh, no. I'm all set. Thank you for asking, though. It's very kind of you. -Sure. -Any particular place you'd like me to set up? -Right there is good. Can I get you anything? Something to drink or-- -No. No, thanks. I'm all set. Here. -What's this? -Case you're modest. Some women are self conscious about their cellulite. I personally think that the Lord gave women cellulite for a reason. -And that would be? -Well, some things are known only to the Lord. Soon as you slip out of your clothes, I'll be ready. -Oh. OK. -I always like to start a session with a prayer. I hope you don't mind. -OK. -Oh dear Lord, let us feel your presence as we embark upon this journey of healing. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, bless this massage. [CHANTING IN LATIN] -I'm sorry. What, what-- what type of massage is this, exactly? -It's a non-secular, full-body tension release. Now relax. Now is the time when you tell me what's on your mind. Just, just release all your anxieties and confess what ails you. -I, I'm fine. -No, no. No, no, no. No, I feel it right here. I mean, did something happen to you recently? Your body is screaming. -I got fired today. -Good. Now breathe in, so you can say it again. -I got fired today. -Ah, one more time. Take a deep breath. Breath in, exhale, and say it louder. -I got fired today. -Yes. Yes! Oh. -Look at these phalanges. So strong, yet supple. Now just relax. Oh, ticklish. I'm sorry. Just relax. I'm just going to relax your legs, and-- -What the hell are you doing? Why are your pants off? -Most of my clients request it. I, I could put them back on if you wan-- -You do that. What kind of clients do you have, anyway? -Exclusively female. I've found that all women hold their tension in their clitoris, and, once released, the healing can begin. -What kind of a whack job are you? -I don't know what you mean. But you know what? This is good. Let it out. -I don't need to let anything out, just you. Go! -No, no, no. Bring it on. Give it to me. This is what I'm here for, to heal, to love, to make what is wrong with you right, through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, and massage. -Would you please leave? I think there's more work to be done here. -No. You know what? I actually feel much better now. I think I can handle it from here. You are really very good at what you do. -Really? -How much do I owe you? -Oh, no. No this one's on me. NIKKI (VOICEOVER): -Great. My first time in two years I'm in my underwear in front of a man, and he's the deacon of the Church Oh, Come, Cop A Feel? Fuck me. I need to get a life. -Well, I'm pretty much booked for the next week. But why don't you call my office on Monday? And we'll set something up for the following week. -OK. Here you go. Ready? -Thank you. -Here you go. -Peace be with you. -Yeah. Buh bye. Here. -Thank you. -Buh bye. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello? -Is Ted there? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Who's calling? -It's Nikki. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Yes. -Nikki Shore. WOMAN (ON PHONE): May I tell him what this is in reference to? -We used to date. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Well, he doesn't date anymore. I'm his wife. -Oops! ALAN (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Alan. Can't come to the phone right now, so leave a message. -Hi. Sorry I never got back to you. This is Nikki. Nikki Shore. You, um, you called me a few months ago, and you asked me to go to a, um, um, game. And, um, shit. Sorry. I'm, u-uh, I-- I was just really busy then, but now I just got fired today. I've, I've got lots of time now. And I'm not sure if baseball's still on or anything, but I thought maybe we could, um-- [DIALTONE] -Hello? MAN (ON PHONE): Oh. Hi. Is this Nikki Shore? -Alan? MAN (ON PHONE): No, this is Billy Bob from Rathers Telecommunications. -Oh. Hi. BILLY BOB (ON PHONE): I'd like to tell you how you could save money on your long distance. -Sure, that'd be great. I've been in the city about eight years now. I had a job until I got fired today. But this really nice woman, she just wanted to sleep with me. So stupid. What's the big deal? I should've just let her rub up against me. What's the big deal, right? [DIALTONE] -Hello? Hello? Billy Bob? Uh. Hello? CLAY (ON PHONE): Nikki, it's Clay, your ex-fiance. -Shit. Did I call you last night, too? CLAY (ON PHONE): No. Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm fine. CLAY (ON PHONE): Um. I don't know how to tell you this, so I just will. Your aunt Nicolette died last night. -[SIGHS] CLAY (ON PHONE): Nikki? -Yeah, I'm here. I'll be there as soon as I can. NIKKI (VOICEOVER): Why do I feel so alone? God, it shouldn't be any different. I can't believe I'll never see the only mother I've ever known. Well, I guess I haven't exactly been the stellar daughter. I haven't been home in, what, eight years? My whole life Nicolette's flitting around the world and dropping in at my boarding schools between break-ups from her latest beau. And then at 70 years old and she decides to be a stay at home mom. God, I just couldn't stay there. I knew she was lonely. I should've known how desparate she was when she gave my fiance the money to start a brewery. Anything to keep me at home. TRAIN CONDUCTOR: Weyerhaeuser fair, my dear? Next stop-- Weyerhaeuser fair. NIKKI (VOICEOVER): Clay must hate me. He has every right. I split on him without even a note. I just wanted him to have his brewery, and I wanted my career. That worked out well. -Hi there. -Hey. -Is that all you got? -Yeah. -Let me take it for you. -Excuse me. How was your trip? -Pretty swell. -Good. -Hey, I've never not made a deadline. Yeah. -You're awfully short. -I'm three. -Three? Ah. Well, that explains it then. Come. Let me show you to your room. Come on. Careful. -My mommy and daddy are dead. -They're in heaven now. You'll be living with me, Nikki. Maybe we should have a bit of gin, just to calm our nerves. Hm? -OK. CLAY: Nikki. You all right? -Yeah. Sorry. Whose stuff is this? -Mine. After Nicolette had her stroke, she was pretty bad off. So I moved in to take care of her. But I-- I'll move it out. -No. No, that's fine. I'll just-- I'll go stay in her room. -Nicolette hated getting old. -Figures. -I'm gonna go into town and get some supplies. You want anything? -No, thanks. -Mkay. You hungry? -More like ravenous. Here you go. -Oh. Thank you. -You're welcome. So what happened? -Well, I found her in bed, so she must have died in her sleep. Strange thing is-- she was wearing a wedding dress. -Who knows? -You know, I was thinking-- a nice thing might be to spread her ashes out around the waterfall. -Sure. -Is that all right with you? -Yeah. No, that'll be good. -All right. -Thanks. -You're welcome. You don't like it? -No. It's good. -Since when don't you eat meat? -For, for a while now. -They don't eat meat in the city? -I don't know what they do. I just don't, I don't like it. -Hm. That's odd. -Why is that so odd? -Well, you used to slam burgers with the best of 'em, bro. -Well, so things have changed. -You on drugs? -Excuse me? -Well, Nicolette said the last time she talked to you, you sounded different. We thought it was drugs. -Oh you did. Did you? So the two of you, what, sat around here, and ate your meat, and talked about me smoking crack in the big, bad city? -Thought you didn't eat meat. -Mm. I'll eat your damn meat, If that's what this is all about. -This is about. caring about somebody else. -Who? You or Nicolette? -Don't flatter yourself. You know, you could have at least come back to see her once. -You know, I have a job. And I can't just come back here every two seconds. -Well, I'm glad you could break away from your busy schedule to come and bury your aunt. -Well, that's nice. That's really nice. You know what? Thanks for the delicious meat. Forgot what I've been missing around here. -Hey, Bucky. Good morning. -Oh, morning. I got your report. -Great. Thank you very much. Hey. Good morning, everyone. EVERYONE: Good morning. EDDIE: Good morning, Mr. P. -How're you doing, Eddie? -Hi, Clay. How're you doing, young man? -Oh, I'm doing great, Dottie. How are you? -Good. Thank you. -Hey, Jeanine. How'd it go last night? -You wouldn't believe it. Maddy threw two touchdowns. -Oh! I'm sorry I missed it. -That move you showed her, it made toast of that other team. -Oh. That's great. Good for her. -We're still on for today. Aren't we? -Oh. I'm sorry, Lissie. I've gotta-- -He's a wicked awesome crawler, so we won't get skunked again, like last week. -I can-- I can't today. -Is it because of Nikki? -Yeah, we've got some things we've got to do. -OK. So we'll do it tomorrow? -OK. BUNKY: Oh my god, Eddie. What have you done? -What happened? It's OK. It's all right. -It's all right. What time are the hops supposed to go in? -Like o-o-over 2 minutes, 40 seconds ago. -I'm sorry, Mr. P. -Don't worry about it. Here. Just clean it up. -This isn't going to work. It, it's, it's not gonna match the other batches. This is-- -Bunky. It's-- -This is-- -Gonna be OK, Bunky. -No, it's not. -What, what should I with this? -No. -Just throw it out. -No. -Oh. OK. -Clay? Clay? I need a lift to the store. Or actually, if you guys have coffee here-- -No. Sorry. -Oh. Uh. Nikkie, this is Bunky, our brew master. Bunky, this is-- -Hi. -You'll have to excuse o-- -How can an office not have coffee? -Well, Dottie already has the shakes, so we had to nix it, 'cause we couldn't keep her away from the coffee. But I'll take you out to breakfast. -Well, but what, what am I supposed to do here? -Uh, listen. Five minutes is not going to hurt the beer. OK? -Yes, it is. -You'll figure it out. - We, we could just let ferment for two more days. You know? Five weeks, six years. Just-- doesn't matter. -Hey, there. -Hey, Stewie. -Sorry to hear about your aunt. -That's sweet. -Hey, Stewie. How are the fish biting? -They're outwitting me, those little suckers. -Ha, they'll do that to you. -And-- there you go. -Oho. That, my friend, is not a word. -It is, too. -I'm afraid not. -Clay. Clay! Is "fraud" a word? -Fraud? -Fraud. -Well, that depends. -Depends on what? -Whether you're cheating or not. -He's the lawyer. -Uh huh. -Well then fraud's definitely a word. -Thank you. -Easy, easy, guys. All right. Clay, good to see you. -Good to see you, Lyle. -Oh, Nikki. My condolences. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Lyle. -Oh. I'm going to be dropping around in a few days, so we have to, you know, go over some things. -OK. Sure. I'm gonna get some coffee. -I'll be right there. You watch out for him. -Hey, Nikki! -Stacy. -How are you holding up? -I'm doing all right. And who is this? -Mikey. He's all mine-- at least I think so. -Uncle Clay! -Hey, Mikey! What-- did you get kicked out of school today? -No. Ms. Sanders has the cramps. -Mikey! -Hm. -Well, that's what she told Mrs. Rogers. -Well, good for you, bad for her. -How long are you staying? -Just until I get things settled. -Nikki! You look great. You guys coming over for a beer tonight? -I don't know if, um-- -We'll see how it goes. -I'm sure they have a lot to do. -Oh, right. Of course. -Are you hunting now? -No. Roadkill. -Hey, can I get you two something to eat? -My dad makes wicked good egg sandwiches. -The best. -Egg sandwiches, it is. -OK. -Clay! I was just headed up your way when I saw your boat. -Ah, Nikki. I, I've got your aunt right here. -What is that? -It's an ash shaker. I invented it myself. It makes it really easy when you spread around the ash-- oh. Ooh. Excuse me. Uh. Yep. O-oh. -Ash shaker. -How's it going? What? -An ash shaker. -Huh. -Yeah. An ash shaker. It makes it easy when you spread around the ashes. And she liked the yellow roses. -OK. Well, thanks, Max. Thanks. - You, uh, you two kids have a good day. Huh? -Whoever coined the phrase golden years ought to be plied with laxatives and tied to a walker. -Nicolette? -I look really good. Don't I? -Really young. -So I shaved off a few years. -A few? -Listen, don't be so insolent. You like? -You're getting married. -Fortunately, you won't have to suffer through it. You won't be missing much. The guest list is comprised of a bunch of stiffs. My whip came with me. -And the groom would be? -Clay Parker, of course. -You're marrying Clay. My Clay? -Oh, your Clay. No, silly. Clay Parker Senior, his grandfather, love of my life. -Since when? -Since always. -Oh, god. -You should have relations. They'll definitely relax you. -Relations mean fuck all. Please! -You're a very uptight person. -I think anyone would be uptight who had their dead aunt hanging around, giving post-mortem sexual advice. -I would have given you advice sooner if you just would've come home every once in a while. -Go away. I don't need advice, especially from the UN ambassador of spread eagle come see my world. -Oh. If you're suggesting I have ever been other than sequentially monogamous, you are sorely mistaken. How long has it been since you've had sex? -That is none of your business. -Oh, that's what I thought. -A girl your age really should be active. -Don't you think I want to have sex? -I don't know. Do you? -Of course, I do. Haven't had so much as a roll around in a bazillion years. Hi. -Hi. You're home early. -Early? It's 9 o'clock. I haven't been home this late in a bazillion years. -Ugh. -Right there. Right there was the first time I ever saw your titties. -You did not! -Oh. Yes, I did. -Shut up. -1981. Yup. I think you were, like, over there somewhere, and that little tiny green bikini top was floating way over here. -I am so sure you didn't see anything. -Oh. Yes, I did. Yep. You did a cannonball in there, and if I'm not mistaken, there was a lot of extra room in that bikini top of yours. -Well, that is because I was being optimistic. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. And rightly so. -Hm. -Well, I think we should talk. Say some memories about Nicolette. -You know, I, I don't really have any memories that are appropriate for this situation. -Are you forgetting your 13th birthday party? -My 13th birthday party? You threw me a Bat Mitzvah. -I simply wanted you to be culturally aware. -You were dating Marvin Simon, and you wanted him to think we were Jewish. -What about India? We had a nice time. -Oh, yeah. India. You left me in some barren ash room with a bunch of undernourished kumbayars. And you, you're off on an elephant tour with Prince Rajeef Ik Hounansti Kumastella. -It wasn't inappropriate. You were a child. -It's not appropriate for a ten-year-old to be fasting. -I cannot be around you when you're this negative. -OK. Go then. -OK. Well, that wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but it's a start. Oh, come on, Nikkie. Don't be like that. Nikki! -That was nice. -Mhm. I'm really sorry about pushing you today. -No. You know what I was thinking? Maybe we'll just leave her here. You know? -Sure. So when are you heading back? -Well, as I can. I do have to get back to work. -Right. Of course. -You know what? I had this really weird dream that Nicolette was hanging around. -It's probably normal. -If I saw something, and you didn't-- Do you think it's in my imagination? -Nah. I just think you're crazy. I'm just kidding, Nikki. You're probably exhausted and just need some sleep. -You're right. I am exhausted. I'm going to go to bed. -OK. -Night. -Night. -Morning. -Hey. -Mr. uh, Fairbanks, he's up at the house. And apparently you have to be there for the reading of the will. -Oh. OK. -Oh. Hello, young man. -Hello. -Can I get anybody anything before we get started? -No, no, no. Thank you, dear. All right. This is the last will and testament of Nicolette Ann Davis, God love her. Dated August 25th, uh et cetera, et cetera-- uh, details. Oh, here it is. The 5,000 acres, livestock, castle, brewery-- essentially everything she owns-- she leaves to, uh, Nicole and Clay, to be divided equally. And provisionally-- -Provisionally? -Yes. The provisions are that you must reside, together, in the castle and work full time, side by side, in the Lucknow brewery, for a time not less than one year from this day forward. -Is this some sort of a joke? -Should either party fail to adhere to these provisions, both parties shall forfeit their inheritance. -You've gotta be kidding. -That's not right. -Let me simplify it for you. Both of you have to live and work together or get nothing. -OK. Is this even legal? -People are entitled to leave their belongings however they wish. -Did you witness this thing? Uh, no. Arthur Finkel signed as witness. -OK. Fine. Here's what we do. Clay, you stay here. You run things. I'll go back home. And then in a year, we sell it. We split it. And it's done. -I'm afraid, uh, that's not possible. You see, I'm the trustee, and I must monitor provision compliance on a random basis. -What if we don't comply? -Well, then the entire property will be turned over to the Hare Krishnas to use as they see fit. Well, that concludes our business. Goodbye, and, uh, good luck. I'll see myself out. -The Hare Krishnas. -Don't just stand there. Help me. -Help you what? -I can't walk down the aisle like this. It's ripped. -What kind of an insane game are you trying to play here? -I have no idea what you're talking about. -Even from your grave, you're still trying to manipulate me. -Did it ever occur to you that I may know best? -No. Never. -This time, young lady, you're not running. -Is everything all right? -She's driving me insane. -Who -Nicolette. She's standing right here. Oh, god. -OK. Come on. Let's go-- -No, she really was here. -I'm sure she was. -Right here. -No, I know. It's OK. Come on, let's get to sleep. It'll all look different in the morning. Come on. -Somehow I doubt that. -You're late. -Don't push it. -I hear she's staying. -I hope they get back together. -He'd be a fool. She would just leave them at the altar again. -Oh, they didn't quite make it to the altar, dear. -I don't know what Nicolette possibly thought you could do here. -Well, I do have a master's in business. I'm sure I can come up with something. -That's right. You're gonna have to quit your job. -I already have. -I think Clay is such a catch. -Yeah, and that big fish is mine. -Have you learned nothing? -So we're really going to do this. -You know, at this point, I don't see any choice. -She chased that Simons boy straight into the next county. What was that all about? -I happen to like four-wheeling. -Oh, yeah. It's just like you like fishing. Don't you know? You have to settle down and act more like a lady? Now don't get me wrong. I'm all for women libby, but just-- not when you're courting. If Clay wants you, he'll come to you. LISSIE: There is only one thing standing between me and Clay. Is it true that you're staying? -I'm not really sure. I actually need to talk to your father. Is he around? -No. He's out hunting. -When's he gonna be back? -When he either shoots himself or his limit. -Well, can't you get in touch with him? -What do you want with daddy? -Well, he witnessed the s-screwy will that my aunt left, and I need to talk to him about her state of mind. -Well, he always said she was crazy as a loon. Are you Clay getting back together? -Oh god. No, Lissie. I just wanna get this will business taken care of, and get the hell out of here. -I think maybe we could help each other. NICOLETTE: Men like that. I think you really should consider wearing a skirt. -Ugh. Oh, I'm sorry. -Oh. No, it's OK. I'm almost done in here. Um, do you want me to wait for you? Or-- -No. No, I have to take a shower. I'll just meet you on down there. -OK. -I saw you peek. -I did not. -Yes. You did. -Yes. You did. -Shut up. -You don't have to get so mad at me. It's nothing you haven't seen before. -Not for a very long time. -Apparently not for a very long time. -Ha ha. -Not bad, huh? -It is never going to happen. -I wouldn't be so sure of that. -Nikki. Nikki? -Lyle. What're you doing here? -Uh, I came to fix something. -Fix want? -Anything that's broken. -Where's Nikki? -Aren't you a little overdressed, Lyle? -No. -Well, nothing needs to be fixed right now, Lyle. -Well, uh-- maybe Nikki needs something fixed. -Now that's a definite possibility. I'll get her to call you. -Think she will? -She might. -Yeah? -You never know. -Oh, good. Good. O-oh, uh. Could you, uh, give those to Nikki for me? -Sure. Well, of course. -Don't forget. All right? -Nope. I won't forget. -So, uh you really think she's gonna call? -Did you talk him yet? -Well, no. Not yet. -Well, do you think he'll go for it? -I'm sure he will. He doesn't even know you like him like that yet. -That's true. -Did you get a hold of your father? What is it? -Excuse me? -OK. What is it? -I-- I, I, I-- -Eddie, I'm in the middle of a conversation here. What do you need? -The idiot probably just dropped something again. -Eddie, what? What is wrong with him? -Oh, he's just stupid. So what's next? -Just come over tonight, and I, I'll come up with something. -Morning. -Hey. -Oh. These are for you. -Thank you. -They're from Lyle. -Hm. -Oh! -Everything all right? -It's fine. -Yeah? -Yep. -So a party in here without me? -No. -There has been a snafu in today's delivery. -Oh, no. What now? -I'm afraid I did not witness the incident. You should have a look see. -Eddie. -Nikki! -What? -Nikki. -What? -What did you say to him? -Nothing. What's wrong with him? -Well, you must have said something to hurt his feelings. -Why do you think it was me? -Because everybody else here knows not to. -He's extraordinarily sensitive. -If he's been drinking, we should just fire his ass. -Nikki, he's a good kid. He just has a little problem coping with adversity. You know what? When he sobers up, you've go to say you're sorry, too. -Well, I am not apologizing. -Come on. You know what? If you're gonna work here, you've got to get with the program. -No. The program needs to change. This is ridiculous. -Come on. You and me, let's go. -Are you sure this is going to work? -Oh, trust me. This is foolproof. -All right. -Hey, Nikki. Lissie! Ha! My two favorite girls. Hey. How you doing? -Sorry, Nikki. -How you doing? -Oh. It's nothing to me. -Oh, sh- tequila. -Roger started some drinking game. -Roger? Was Roger there? Now why didn't you tell me? -Whatever. -Maybe we should just get you to bed. -No. No, no, no. Let's have a drink. Come on. -Oh, I'm out pal. I think you've probably had enough, too. -Later-- I tell you about Lissie. Come here. Did you know that Lissie, here-- she's the best friend a guy could have? She's the best friend. Do you know? She's the best fisherman that ever lived. You look really good. -Thank you. -I don't think this you-na-key. -All right. Come on, you. Let's go. -Where are we going? OK. We're gonna go fishing. -Maybe tomorrow. -Let's go right now. -Good night, pal. -Let's gets the gem! -Good night. -Good night. -I heard about the will. That's whacked. -Huh, see what we can do about it. -Would it be all that bad to live here for a year? -You know I couldn't do that. -I remember thinking that when Stacy and I fell in love, and she wanted to live here. I never thought I could do it. I don't know exactly when it happened, but I just fell in love, you know, with the people, their idiosyncrasies. -Hey, I am glad you're happy here, but I just want to go home. -OK. I hear you. We just missed you is all. Good night. -Good night. Take care. -Uh. May I please have a word with you? -Sure. Come on in. -Uh. I know you're a creative business person, and, um, I can sense that you would like to see some changes around here. So would I. This is a finished product. Lucknow means me. Uh-- I'm the brewery. -Does this happen often? -In the six years we've been open, 436 times-- that I know of. W-- we've got really great people here, but as employees-- I, I just don't know. Lissie's boat is out there, but where is she? She's not on the line. Jeanine, poor dear-- even with her glasses. -I, I-- I'll come up with something for you, Bunky. -Great. -OK? -Thanks. Um. It's, it's nice to be heard. You know? -OK. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Good morning, honey. -[GROANS] Hi, Lissie. -Get to bed, sweetheart. -No. Listen. Look, look, look-- I, I, I really don't, uh, really don't know what happened last night. -Yeah, I don't know either, but it was magic. Wasn't it? -You know, I, I don't feel so good. -Well, I know something that could make you-- -Oh, uh. ---feel better. I could just rub your head. [COUGHING AND VOMITING SOUNDS] [TOILET FLUSHING] -What? -No. Look, look. No. I'm sorry. -Oh. That's OK, baby. I'll just make you some breakfast. -No. I can't. I'm feeling better. Look, I just-- I just need to get cleaned up. OK? -Oh. All right. -Great. Thanks. Oh, g-- [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] -Lissie, not here at work. -Lissie, not here at work. -Well. It's nice of you to join us. -I had permission. -What's up with you, girl? -Clay and I are officially a couple. -Oh! I'll believe that when I see it. Jeanine! -What? ---you can see this? Oh, look. L-- Lissie just kissed Clay right on the mouth. -Ooh. Such a tickle bunny. -I've got such a headache. -Oh, Mr. Tickle Buddy? I'll get you an aspirin. Here you go. -Thank you. This water is amazing. It, it's right out of the faucet. -Yep. That's what makes the beer taste so good. -Is it from our springs? -Yeah. We pump it right in your to the brewery. -Well, why haven't you bottled it? -It's too expensive. -It's a $50 billion business. -Is that right? -Don't you see? We're sitting on an absolute fortune here. -Fortune or not, we're not going into the bottled water business-- if that's where you're going. -Oh. Come on, clay. It's not as scary as you think. -It has nothing to do with being scared. We're a brewery, and everybody's happy. -And why is that? Because they don't know any better, that's why. -No. Yo-- you just don't get it. You don't get it. Do you? [BUZZING SOUND] -What is that? -Lunch. -Everybody eats at the same time? -Mhm. -Of course they do. Are you coming? You want a soda? -Sure. -Thanks. That's quite a, quite a meal you've got there, Bunky. -Yes. My culinary skills are quite developed. In fact, this meal would go perfect with our last year's gold medal winner for India Pale Ale. Of course, we don't partake of alcoholic beverages at work-- most of the time. -Hey. My mum made these. Do you want to try one? -No. Oh, sure. Thanks. DOTTIE: Oh. How sweet. Oh. -What did he give you today? Smells like a sunflower. -Sunflowers doesn't even have a smell. -Sure they do. Everything has a smell. -Dottie. I forgot to put your napkin in. -Oh. -We have napkins here, Max. -But not like his napkins. Thanks, honey. -Have a nice day. Oh, Nikki. How'd that ash shaker work out? -Oh. Fine. Thanks, Max. -Good to hear it. I, uh, got a patent on it. Could mean big bank one day. See you at home, honey. -Bye, Max. -When are you going to marry him already? -Oh, I'm just taking my time. -How much time do you think you've got left? -I've got plenty of time left. -Where's Clay? -He's out there. He just walked by. -Oh. Honey? Aren't you gonna have something to eat? -Nope. -But you need your strength. -I'm not hungry. -Men. Anyway, I know that Halloween is still a few weeks away, but I just wanted to tell you that, uh, Clay and I are going to be having a party. And that you're all invited. DOTTIE: Oh. Great. -That's nice. -Boston, Mass, please. Global Water. Yes. Yeah. Uh, Ms. Taylor, please. This is Nikki Shore. Oh. Um, I have a water sample that I'd like to send out to her, so I just need to confirm your address. Great. Thanks. Solids and stripes? -You're on. -Talked to Bunky today. And -Oh. Is that right? -Clay, you have people working in jobs who aren't even qualified. -Oh, yeah. Like who? Well, Jeanine's in quality control, and she can't even see. -Jeanine is a single mom, whose husband brought her up here and then left her. She needs the job. -I'm confused. Is this a charity or a business? -Nice. Real nice. [DOORBELL RINGS] -Don't answer it. -OK. I mean, have you even seen how Dottie puts on the labels? [DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN] -Look-- for your information, Miss MBA, most of our beers go out in kegs, which, by the way, Eddie can lift several of. -Yeah. When he's not drunk. -Look-- [KNOCKING] ---if you don't like the way that I'm doing things, why don't you just go home? -Oh, nice try. It's half mine now-- or it will be. Look, you know, I am just trying to help. [MORE KNOCKING] -For your information, the brewery's been in the black ever since it started. -Yeah. But you could do so much better. [MORE KNOCKING] -It's a microbrewery, Nikki. -Won't you just let me come up with a little reorganization? -OK. But nobody loses their job. -Fine. -Hey. Didn't you hear me? I was ringing the doorbell. -Hi, Lissie. -Brought some decorations over. I think we should get started. -We're having a Halloween party. -Oh. What do you think of them? Are they cute? I thought that he'd look really good on the front door, and I got some fake spider webs for the ceiling. And I got hay to put on the floor, and flowers for the living room. A-ah. What do you think? --[SIGHS] I think I don't feel so good, and I'm just going to go upstairs and go to bed. Good night, girls. -Night. -I talked to daddy today. And, uh, we didn't get around to talking about Nicolette yet, but he is going to call back. -OK -And I think I'm going to have to move in here, because, well it just doesn't look right otherwise. -How is Clay going to feel about that? -Well, that's your problem. -You have got to see this. -You have absolutely no sense of decency. -Well, I've never seen the point, really. Oh, my. -Move over. -Lissie, look. I'm sorry, but I, I can't. -You can't, or you won't? You said you loved me. -L-Lissie, I, I, I don't remember, but look-- we've been friends for a really long time. Come on. Let's not blow it. All right? -You begged me to make love with you, and I believe-- [GASPING] -OK. [GASPING] -OK. -[GASPS] --and I believe [GASPS] -Al- all right. W- I- Why don't you just lay down here? Come on. Come on. -[GASPS] -Just lay down. That's good. Just relax. -[GASPS] -Relax. -[GASPS] -All right. That's it. -[GASPS] -Al-- -Will you lay with me? [GASPS] -OK. -Please. -OK. OK! OK. -Oh, that is so pathetic. -I thought that she was pretty good, actually. -Oh, but the girl's in love with someone who doesn't even like her. -Oh, you're not buying into that crap. Are you? Loving and fishing are two different things. -How would you know? -Excuse me? -What do you know about love? -I know. NICOLETTE: Don't make the same mistake that I did. NIKKI: You loved each other so much. -I know. He didn't even get my last letter. It was just too late. -He'd already married somebody else. -Yeah. He sure did. -That's the saddest thing I ever heard. I'm so sorry for you. -I know. So am I. MADDY: I couldn't believe it went straight to it. It had to at least be 45 yards. -I'm going to have to steal him for a bit, little one. Honey, we have to mingle with everybody. -Oh. Here, let me get that for you. -Oh. Thank you. -I, I don't think we've met. I'm Bunky. -Bunky? -Oh. Jeanine. Wow. Y-you're, you're beautiful. -O-oh. OK. -Did I miss something? -Well, cupid just came to our doorstep. -Oho, nice. -Isn't it, though? Is that Mr. Fairbanks? Mr. Fairbanks! -Doesn't mommy make a great Cleopatra? -Yeah. Sh-- she does. -Clay said you'd call, but I guess you got busy. Uh, I'll fix anything you got broken for free-- I mean, no charge. -That's very sweet of you, Lyle. You really deserve a woman who loves you. -Yeah, but you love Clay. I, I can tell by the way you look at him. He loves you, too. -What makes you say that? -I heard him talking with Danny at the bar the other night. -Well, will you excuse me? -Yeah, go ahead. -Oh. Thank you. She's been driving me nuts for weeks now. I forgot all about this room. -Yeah. -That's a cute little outfit you're wearing. -Oh, this old thing? -Yeah. -Remember that luau? -Yeah. -You couldn't wait to get there. -Ha. What I remember is that hula dancer who looked like she ate a couple of her coworkers. -I think she wanted to no-ne, no-ne you. -Oh, I think she wanted to have me for lunch. But you saved me on that one, too. -Yeah. Well, just that kinda gal sometimes. -Yeah. You are. LISSIE: Everyone gather 'round. -I think we better get back. -Yeah. -Everybody, we have a big announcement. Oh, there you are. Come here, honey. -Go ahead. -Well. So everybody knows-- I love this lady standing next to me. I, I asked her six times for her hand in marriage. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell ya, the seventh is the charm. -Everybody, we have another bit of good news. The love of my life, Clay Parker, and I are expecting our first child. I'm preggers! -I beg to differ. -What's wrong? -Her. -All I said was it smelled like it needed more chinook. -Can you believe that? -But it does! And maybe a touch more haletile? -Work with me here, Bunky. Just try it. -All right. Hm. -It's perfect. -Oh. It is. -OK, then. -Jeanine, thank you. -You're welcome. [BELL DINGS] -What was that? -Dottie just got a sale. So is congratulations in order? -Honey, look at what Jeanine brought us. -That's nice. -Are you feeling better? -Uh huh. -Oh, good. I can't believe this happened. -You ever hear of birth control? -I don't even remember sleeping with her. -Oh, how special. -[SIGHS] -No way, man. I'm not letting you do it. -It's not about me anymore, Dan. -But I don't even see how it could have happened. You were shit-faced that night. -Doesn't matter how. The point is it happened. -Listen, how about this? Just sit on it for a bit. The best decision right now is to not make one. You hear me? -Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right. --[BURPS] We're going to need more milk. -Oh, I'll put that right on my list. -Look, daddy won't cooperate. -Excuse me? -Well, with the baby coming and all, we need all the money we can get. Of course, that means you'll probably have to stay, but I don't think that's gonna be a problem. -Oh. You don't? -Um. Will you excuse us for second? -Sure. -What is it, honey? -I think we should get married. -Yes. Yes! I would love to marry you. -[SCOFFS] -Morning. -Morning. -Morning, Bunky. -Good morning. -Good morning, Jeanine. -Good morning. -Good morning, Dottie. -Morning. -Morning. -Morning. -Can I get you anything else? -No. Thank you, honey. -Come on, Eddie. Let's get these cases out. -What's with you? -He's going to make a wonderful husband. -Aren't you jumping ahead of yourself a little bit? -He popped the question last night? -What? -It was so romantic. -Oho. -That's wonderful. -I know. -Yes. It's wonderful. -When's the wedding? -Very, very soon, and you are all invited. Huh. Excuse me. -Did you hear that? -I can't believe he asked her to marry him. -I know. How could he? -It is amazing water. I'm glad you feel the same way. Two weeks. No, I was hoping we could do this sooner. All right. Well, when you come up, I'll, I'll just show you around, and we'll just sign the contracts then. No. Thanks, Fifi. Yeah. I look forward to seeing you, too. -Honey. Dinner's ready. -I'll be right down. -Hurry before it gets cold. -I'm coming. -I've never known you to be such a quitter. -It's your game, and I'd say it's over. I mean, you can't quit something you weren't playing. -Ugh, there is no baby. -How do you know? -You have to have sex to have a baby. Did Clay Tell you they had sex? -No. He said he didn't remember. -Well, they didn't. -What do you do-- like lurk around and watch people in intimate situations? -Basically. It's my only form of entertainment. You really should tell him. -No, I'm staying out of it. -You know what? They haven't had sex yet, but they will. If you're not going to do for yourself or for Clay, think of the child those two might bring into this world. I mean, for God sakes, it could have that girl's hair. -Give it up, Nicolette. Nicolette? Mr. Finkel, how'd you get in here? -Don't move. We'll get it. -It's just a little one. It's fine. -OK. -Look, I asked you here to talk about my aunt. -Your aunt. Did you know, young lady, that I lost my virginity to your aunt many years ago, when I was just a young buck? -No, but thank you for sharing. It's fine. Just leave it. -You know, it was a never ending rutting season with that woman. Oh, thank the Lord. Oh. Stay. Take this. Keep your eyes open. I'm getting it. -I know that Nicolette had some crazy notion about playing me, but she's with your daughter now, and they're having that baby, and-- -Baby? She can't have kids. She's sterile. Hands off. -I need you to say that Nicolette was insane. -This is your lucky day, pal. -Mr. Finkel. -Nicolette was as crazy as a loon. -Thank you. -Oh. Couldn't sleep? Thanks. Clay, I don't think there's a baby. -Don't start. -No, really. I mean, you don't even remember having sex with her. She could be lying. -For your information, we did make love. -Oh, he was smashed that night. -Not that it's any of your business, but we made love in the morning. -No. No. We did not make love that morning. Lissie, are you or are you not pregnant? -Well, I mean, she's the liar. Yeah. Did you know she's been trying to get me to get daddy to change his testimony, so that she'd get everything? I heard you on the phone. Clay, she is selling the springs and everything. -What? -No. It's not like that at all. All I was doing was I set up a meeting, and that's the end of it. -You never cease to disappoint. -Maybe your expectations have always been too high. -Apparently so. -Honey? Clay? Wait. Sweetheart, you can't just walk out on me! -Watch me. -Uh huh. You mother rutting cow. I'm gonna kill you. -Stop it. Calm down. Calm down. -You want me to calm down? I'll tell you when I'll calm down. I will calm down when you are dead. -Nice one. Was that the good champagne? -No. I put the nice bottle on ice. Maybe we should have a little, just to calm our nerves a bit. Hm? -OK. -OK. [DOORBELL RINGS] -Here. Oh. Hi. -Where's my little snuggle buggle? Oh, daddy. She made up all these lies, and now Clay's gone. -Oh, no. Not this again. It's all my fault. You know? I taught my little girl how to hunt. I guess that just doesn't work in the romance department. -But I loved him daddy, so much. -Oh. I know you did. I know you did. Just like all the others. Well, let's get you home. -I'm sorry. -No. I'm sorry. We'll find another young buck for you, one that isn't so particular-- uh, skittish. Skittish. It's all right, dear. Don't worry about it. -Oh. Hey. Come on, tiger. Time to get up. Let's go. [SIGHS] -Mikey, honey, sit up. -It smells really good, sis. Thanks. -It's delicious, honey. How you doing today, bro? -I'll live. -You going into work? -No. -You know, uh, we could use some help at the store. -That's a great idea. -No. I, I was thinking that maybe I'll, uh, just take some time out on the boat. -No. We could really use the help. I insist. -I need some time. -Clay. -OK. Sheesh. -All right. Thank you. Hello, dear. -I hired some new people to keep up with you. -I really love it. -You are an amazing saleswoman. -Thanks. -Oh. Here are some expense receipts. Uh, there's no worry on them. I know where you work. -Thanks. -Anchor? -Stace, hi. It's, uh, Nikki. Do you know where Clay is? -Yeah, he's here. -Well, I have a bit of an emergency. Clay has the key to the strong box, and Dottie desperately needs to be reimbursed. -Clay, the phone's for you. -I'm not here. -It's Nikki. -I'm not here. -She needs the key to the petty. -Tell her it's in the bottom right-hand drawer of the desk. -Did you get that? -Yeah, great. Tell him thanks. Bye. -Just a half cup more of the Vienna, and try a dash of the chocolate malt. -Um. Mat-- Maddy has a game tonight. Doesn't she? -7 o'clock. -Would she mind if I came? -I think she'd really like that. -Well, may-- maybe we could, uh, get a bite to eat afterwards. -Maddy loves pizza. -Uh, well, what do you like? -Me? -Yeah. Um. Pizza? -Sure. -You are not allowed to speak to me like that. -Hey. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. -Two burgers, medium well. Are you OK? -Hey, Nikki. -Is, uh, Clay here? It's OK. I, I just wanted to give him this. It's the deed to the brewery. I'm heading home in a couple of days. -We're gonna miss you. -Thanks. Will you tell him that Dottie is up to 22 new accounts? Oh, and Bunky's made four new types of beer, thanks to Jeanine's help? And Eddie-- he defended himself yesterday. -Great. -They all miss him. -What about you? -What about me? What? -Do you miss him? -Yes, Danny. I do. -See you. You get all that? -Yeah. -The brewery is going to have to have access to the springs. -Absolutely not. The brewery will just have to find another source of water. -Excuse me. -We're in the middle of a meeting, here, sonny. It'll just have to wait. -What do you need, Eddie? -I just wanna let you know that the eclairs with the maple sprinkles are here. -Thank you. -OK. -I, I'd like to thank you all for coming, but I'm afraid it's not going to work out. -You're crazy. We're offering you a fortune here. -You know, that just doesn't sound quite as good as it used to. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an eclair to eat. -You two have completely and utterly exhausted me. The springs are yours, and she's yours. Don't screw this up. -What the--? -You're such a good boy. You're such a good boy. What the he--? What do you have here, laddie? -Does that mean yes? -I love you. -I love you. -Well, funny thing about that ring. You're never gonna believe it. -Oh. I think I will. -Oh, yeah? -Excuse me. Can I have everybody's attention? I'd like you all to take a beer. Eddie, you get water. My lovely wife and I would like to thank you all for a job well done. As you know, we set our estimates this year at $10 million. -12. -$12 million. Bottom line-- we blew the lid off of those projections, and we ended up grossing over $20 million in revenue. Congratulations. And thank you all very, very much.
