Sh, sh, sh, sh. Come on, Lu. Sweetie, can you get the door. Seat belt, baby. How's school? Lu. Really? Pardon? I said, how's school? I'm on probation for two weeks. You think that's funny? No, I just haven't thought it through yet. Well why don't you explain it to me. You just missed - the turn off. - That was the turn off. Okay. Luana, we made a deal. That's rude, - y'all can't just... - Just put it away or I'm taking it away, I'm serious. Hey, about school, I'd very much like an explanation. Can we please discuss it at Grandpy's? How long will that be? If we don't stop every hour we'll be there before dark. Is someone gonna tell me? Does your mother know? Marty, I told you I, wait, are you talking about Luana? Yes, of course. No, I don't wanna give her anything else to worry about. Please, that's not what I'm talking about. Did you ask Luana? What if she was to say... I didn't ask Luana. What if she was to say you don't say anything about us separating? You wanna make her a part of this? Now what the hell did she do? She made a stupid choice. Is somebody gonna tell me, or do I make a stupid choice? Hey. What did you do? Marty, I said, let's discuss it at Grandpa's. What did you do? Marty! Marty! Dad! Oh my god! Pull over, pull over! Oh god, pull over, pull over. Oh Jesus. You know what, I'm gonna keep it a secret that you snuck out of the house last night, how's that? What? What, who were you with? Were you with Jalla? Who else? Dammit, Luana! It's not that big a deal. It is a big deal. You don't go anywhere for a year, do you understand me? Nowhere. And don't you say anything to Grammy about us separating, do you understand? Keep your eyes on the road. Okay, so I'm taking one dress and one pair of pants, and your old dirty green KONG. Maybe Daddy will play with you. Do you remember Daddy's place? Two dresses? Do you remember Daddy is the question that we are asking today. He may be very sick, Aubrey. So be mindful of that if he doesn't wanna play, or if you don't wanna play, old man. My god, he may be , please in your mercy, I know he hasn't been observant but he's a good, good man, and one of your children, albeit a lying little piss. Forgive him. Two pairs of shoes? What do you think? Yeah, oh what the hell, why not? Why don't you want her to know? Duh. Grandpy's really sick, he might not, just remember, we're still together, okay? Hi mom. Hi, honey. Oh, it's so great to see you all. You too. Mm. - Hi. - How are you? Oh. Bettye Sue, you look wonderful. Oh thanks, Marty. How is he, is he feeling okay? Uh well, he may be a little hungry. Mom, he'll be fine. We'll grab a bite when we stop. Okay uh, are you hungry, can I fix you something? - No, no, no, no, no, no. - No, we're good. Pretty long drive, six hours. Yeah, if you speed. Let me help you with Aubrey. No, I'll just put him on my lap, honey. Well, you know, Luana can keep him on her lap. She loves dogs, right Lu? Come on baby. Come on, big boy, oh, there we go. There we go. Hi, Aubrey. Graham Dietz, Hillary Post, and Nelson Mahone send their love. Marty, you look at little tired. How are you, honey? I like your hair. Aubrey? He thinks your hair is beautiful. Weather's been frightening. I don't scare easy. You look beautiful, how are you, honey? Thanks. You know, I dreamed about this last night, just last night. Of you and me and, you know, autumn splendor, colors, leaves drifting down, softly, gently, slowly like little lives. It was 80 degrees on Tuesday. Prodigious, fine, you don't have to do this. Yeah well I said I would, so. I said a thousand things I said I'd do. Never felt actually compelled to do them. Not all of them. You have to make astute decisions. No, no philosophy or I definitely won't do it. Well, I appreciate your effort, means a lot to me. See, and that is why I'm doing it. Okay. They'll get a huge kick outta this. And you won't? You'll be in seventh heaven. Is Hugh in pain? He's hinted. What? Very strong prescriptions. I'm not sure he wants to take them. Hugh? What's wrong with his kidneys? They're shutting down. Is that for sure? Did he tell you, or... I got a from a Dr. Belmaraz. His doctor? I guess, or the nurse, how would I know? I haven't seen him in three years. Oh honey, honey, he's peeing. Oh my god, - shit, shit, shit. - No, no, no. Luana, do not use that word. Look what he did! Okay, I see it. - I'm sorry, honey. - Just pull over, Marty. - I'm so sorry. - Right here. - Just pull over right here. - Okay, okay, okay. - Ah! - Leave the window - down a little bit. - Look at this. Ew. Hun, it's just a little pee. - Oh, it's the worst. - Get you cleaned up. Wash the dress. It's fine. - Thank you. - Let me have him. Okay, come on baby. Thank you. Hi, we need uh, bathrooms. Right down there. Mom, I can do it. Okay. Uh, table for four, please. Okay, right this way. Great breed, y'all take care now. Thank you, bye bye. Yes, what a nice man, isn't he? Are you feeling a little better? Yeah, a little calmer. That's it, just breathe, breathe. Hey, do you know who she was with? Jalla and some kid. I think it was one of Belamy's sons. Who? They own the dairy, whatever, the ice cream place. Do you know how old he, nevermind. So, you don't want her to know? Definitely not. It was good last night. I'm having second thoughts about including her in our little charade. She likes being in on it, sharing with us, anything. Anything. You know what I mean. Was it as good as Gretchen? Did you? Did you? Whoa. Hi, what can I get for you today? Um, I will have the um, ooh yes, the country ham and biscuits and gravy, - and unsweetened tea. - Okay. Yeah, no um, I'll have ice tea sweet. Okay. Oh, speaking of sweet. Um, on the mirror... Honey, order something. Give her a chance to look at the menu first. Yeah it's just... Rush, rush, rush. Forget it, forgive me, Luana, read. Um, grilled cheese and root beer. Okay. What, honey? Nothing. We met the nicest man out there, he has a corgi. Oh, save your leftovers. Are you wearing lipstick? What? Oh, it's very subtle. Nice. It's, wipe it off. Oh, it's just... - Just leave it. - She's just... Just leave it. Aubrey, country ham. Mm, mm, yes little doggie. - Where're your other clothes? - Country ham. Luana. Oh, yes. We're making good time. She's upset. Mm, mm, mm, oh yes. Luana, come on baby. Where's your stuff? Don't look down, and don't get tangled. Don't look up and I won't spit in your eye. I'm serious. I am too, daddy jacker. Language like that'll get you tossed off the mountain. Oh, I'd like to see you try. Chill, Captain, I'm just pullin' your chain. Pull my heartstrings instead. Stay alert, do your job. Hey, you wanna come up here? Okay. Superb. Lu, do you remember Grandpy? I think you were only about six the last time you saw him. Five. You remember him, don't you Lu? Remember what he looks like? Kind of. Well he's gonna be very happy to see you. I'll be happy to see him too. How long till we get back to his house? Probably be dark. You could have a drink, go to bed early. You can text Jalla and let her know I'm gonna be calling her mother. Actually, dancing, we all danced. You and Grandpy danced. Am I right? Yeah, impeccably, we danced, always. Until we danced away from each other. So Marty, you think it will be dark when we get there? I do, yep. I think maybe we better stop so I can walk Aubrey again. I just don't want him to have another accident in the car. Okay. He's all she's got left. What about us? As a companion, honey, you know what I mean. Would anybody else love an ice cream? Um, yeah, I'd love one. Tell 'em the other vans have left. Thanks. Two cherry? Grandma wants cherry. - Hi. - Hi. Um, two cherry. No cherry. Uh, okay, two vanilla cones, one chocolate milkshake, and let's see, one strawberry cone. - Awesome. - Thank you. How old is he? Oh, he's a rescue. You mean Hugh? Oh well, this one's old, Hugh's 76. How much did he tell you? Is he, is he scared? You know, I believe so. I never would've thought so before. He's so cool, I mean, you know him. But he wants me there, he wants all of us there, so. I'm sorry. Yeah. Luana. Bathroom. Oh. He wants the ice cream. It's right there. So you said you haven't seen Dad in three years? When was the last time that you saw him? Mom. Yeah? Listen, listen, when we stopped at the other restaurant before I lost my clothes. - Yeah? - What? Some girl wrote, "He broke my nose, he broke my teeth," with lipstick on the mirror, "crazy." What do you mean, what girl? I don't know, that's the point. Who broke her nose? How would I know? But she wrote again on this bathroom mirror at this place. It said, "He's gonna kill me, help." The same song was playing. Mercy. What're we gonna do? Luana, why didn't you say something? Mom, right now, we need to help her. Well, what do you think we should do? I don't know, call somebody, the police maybe. You know, I'm just saying, it's 4:15, your dad's expecting us, just take that... - Marty. - Hey, stop! Okay, okay, take this, show me. Come on. I'm sorry, there just wasn't any other place. Oh, that's all right, don't be silly. Been there, done that, this one's my baby. Did you wipe some writing off the mirror? - Huh? - Honey. It was written in lipstick. Luana. It said, "He's gonna kill me." I'm sorry. What are you doing? It was there two minutes ago, Mom, I just saw it. Honey, it's okay... It's not okay. Somebody wiped it off, some girl's in danger. She's gonna be killed, Mom, murdered. What are you, hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Luana. - Luana, listen! - What? Don't shout, what is, calm down. Oh god. Hey, Luana, hey. I'm not your baby, don't treat me... I know how you feel about your father and me. What? This has nothing to do with either of you. I know. I keep thinking it's gonna get better as well. We're trying, we're hoping. I want it to, but honey, I can't do anything right now. Mom, I, just don't, please. Listen to me, just... Don't. Why did you sneak out? Dad spent the night. Honey, I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean that you sneak out, okay? Who's the boy you were with? You don't know him. I don't want Jalla and some boy that I don't know to be who you listen to, okay? Who should I listen to? Luana, hey, honey. Hey, hey, hey. You okay? Mom, I'm fine. Oh my god. Hey. Hey, don't hog all the hot water. Come on. Did you solve the mystery? No, and I don't wanna talk about it. Somebody washed the lipstick off. I know they did. Okay. It was there. Do you think I'm making it up? Did anyone else see it? There was a girl at the first place, she thought it was messed up too. Did she tell anybody? I don't know, how should I know? But I saw it again just now back there. I'm not saying you didn't. Did anybody that worked there know anything about it? Or did anybody say anything? Whether you think so or not, I'm on your side. Okay, we ran out of there so quickly, we didn't get a chance to ask anything. Oh shit. Lu. Are you listening to this? You okay with this profanity? No, I'm not. Don't ask me to go back. There comes an end to summer. To spring showers and a hoar rime. His mumming to each mummer has somewhere end in time. Hm. I think it's right here. No, no, no. Are you sure? Yeah. You've been here before? Mm-hmm. You have been here before? Yes. Really? Yeah, three years ago. Right before he left for the holy land. Dad went to the holy land? Yes. Come on, you're kidding. - No. - Why? He was searching. For what? Nay, sweet, let's leave unspoken, the vows, the fates gainsay, for all vows made are broken. We love but while we may. You are lucky they're running late. Lucky, my middle name. Oh yeah? Well what if they don't show up till really late? Or what if they don't even show up till tomorrow? Oh. What pleasure do you derive from all that endless pessimism? Bugs you. That's a perk. So, how long were you there? Two days. Was it pleasant? I mean, you know what I mean. Does he have wifi? Oh, goodness no. Cable, satellite? Grandpy wasn't even sure he wanted a phone. It was classic, you know, hopelessly pleasant. Ah, there it is, there it is, we're right up there, yep. Mom, was he sick the last time you were here? No, well, the usual, nothing different. You know he used to write to me? I mean, he never mentioned the holy land, but. No, he wrote to you, he did? Ah. I'll be doggone. He was finally doing what he wanted to do. DJ to the universe. Good for Hugh. What's the music? That's our song. Mercy, Mom. Hugh, you look great. You look tired. Come on out. Do you remember him now? Yes, we're here. Hey, baby. You remember Daddy, don't you? - Hi, Daddy. - Hi. Got him? - Oh yeah. - Okay. Yeah, she's unequivocally a young lady, a beautiful young lady. Just like her mother. And so much like her grandmother. Come on in, I'll show you your rooms. Place looks different. Well, we've been working. We? Oh yeah. Looks good. Oh , do you have a dog? I'll introduce you to the captain and her dog. Oh, okay. Come on. - This is Jimmie. - Hi. Jimmie, this is my wife, Bettye Sue, my ex-wife. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - And this is our daughter, Tasha. Hi there, hi, how are you? And this is her husband, Marty. - Pleasure. - Hi. And this is our granddaughter, Luana. Hi, it's so nice to meet all of you. I've heard so much about you, and Luana is a wonderful name. Thank you. And this Aubrey. Hi, Aubrey, hi. And this is Sybil. She's having her second birthday tonight and she's thrilled to have all of you at the party, as am I. Well, grab a drink. Champagne? Sparkling apple cider. Sorry, Tash. Happy to participate. Luana, you can drink all you wanna drink. Cheers. Here's to the people and the dogs that I love most in this world, and in the next. How long? Both two years tonight, celebrations galore. Well, congratulations. He looks like he's hanging in. How 'bout you? You've done a lot. There you go. Okay, here you go. Which is your room, Jimmie? I am on the house on the hill. The old hunting lodge. Place looks great. - Yeah. - Um-hm. Well, you guys have a good evening. Oh, you're not gonna join us? No, it's family night. I am into the woods, but I'll see you tomorrow. Come on, girl. Thanks, buddy. Of course, come on. Uh Hugh, you want any help? Sit down, relax, be at home. Red beans and rice, got gumbo, fried okra, cornbread, pineapple. Um-hm, looks great, Luana. I can do it. Okay honey, just be careful, it's hot. If you guys wanna pass your plates around. It sure smells good. Mm-hmm, it looks great too. Oh great spirit, we are ever so thankful for our swell provisions and dwelling, and beyond bliss to be brought together in this, our family circle. Amen. Okay. Luana, have you ever had gumbo before? No. I hope you like it. Me too. That's really good. What a treat. Did Jimmie cook? No, Jimmie's the captain, I'm the cook. You? Yeah. When'd you start cookin', Dad? When no one else would. I heard about your expedition to the holy land. Is that where you learned to pray? Never completely forgotten, or lost. That's new. People change. Okay. A good day to uh... Mm, not at dinner. Thank you, Hugh. My greatest pleasure. Mm, coconut, Mom's favorite. Mine too. Yeah, well you gotta come back. I don't know how you lost weight, eating like this. Nevermind. Hugh, how'd you find this place? On the job, '62 or '63, I can't remember. Anyway, it was the biggest deal in Appalachia. They used to move maybe hundred barrels every week by mule train, thousand gallons a run. It was a family business, back to the '20s. It was New Year's Eve, the good stuff was being served. Allegheny moon, snow piled high, beautiful. Anyway, 2009, the property came up for sale. Well you've done a wonderful job with it. Looks very different than the last time I was here, well done. Jimmie helped a lot. Was Jimmie um, ATF? No no, no, we uh, we met at a meeting in D.C. She had met me at another one somewhere. Do we get to meet the doctors? Is there a hospital nearby? Oh, world class. Dr. Bellmaraz? Yeah. Dad, what's the prognosis? While we're having dessert? I'll tell ya later. Good? Chickens, rabbits, and even if I do say so myself, a decent, very serious garden. Vegetables, herbs, flowers. Oh, look at that. A little uh. What? Nothing, honey. Yeah right, what? I just, I broke up, thinkin' of Hugh raising chickens and rabbits, that's all. Since when? Year and a half. Rabbit meat's the leanest there is. Wait, you eat them? Yeah, tomorrow night we're gonna have stifado. Ooh, I'd go anorexic before I eat a rabbit. Lu. Dad, is, is that for your condition? No. Well um, can we discuss your health now? Shoot. What do you know? What do you wanna do, I mean, what should we know? That you're loved. Hugh, we're all worried. Don't worry. That's why we drove here, together. Mom said you called, um, that a doctor had suggested that... That I'm getting old. That's not exactly how we understood it. How did you understand it? That your kidneys are failing, that you're on strong prescription medicine. Sometimes it hurts, I don't feel good. Dialysis? No, not yet, Marty. Dad, are you dying? Honey. Are you? Every day. Tasha. What? Dad, can you just tell me, how you're feeling, how you're doing? Dad, can you just tell me how sick you are? Okay, that's enough. We're all exhausted. You had me on check anyway, you checkmated me, see? Oh, I did. Come on, come on old man, let's go beddy-bye, sleepy head. - Come on. - Here we go. Come on, okay. I don't know if he's gonna make it up the stairs. I'll help ya. Dad, I really hope you come back down so we can understand this better. Every time. Why are you angry at your father? Sweetheart, your grandpa was a much different man when I knew him. We just need to get to the bottom of his condition, the truth. He's got a way of slowly but surely avoiding the truth. Um, when can I go to get online? Not tonight, honey. I'll drive you tomorrow. You know what, why don't we get you ready for bed, come on. Now? You can read a book, you've got a whole library. Can I ask you a question? - Mm. - Sure, honey. Don't avoid the truth. Are you two getting back together? Sweetheart, we're workin' on it. Yeah. You just need to know that we love you. Hey, more than anything in the world. Love you too. I wanna know what's gonna happen. Of course, come on baby, let's get you to bed. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. He's breathing's gotten poor. Oh, I know, I know, I'm scared for him. I know, B. Tasha and Marty are having troubles with each other. It's conspicuous, I noticed it immediately. I mean, she said they drove here together. What about Luana? She's reacting a lot of different ways, not all of 'em good. But Tasha has been just seized by the furies, that's why she so. Why does everything happen at once, huh? Huh? I have something I wanted to say to you. What? Oh god, oh Hugh, - oh no. - No, no, no, no, no, I'm okay, I'm fine, in fact, I'm better. I've been craving this moment and I just didn't expect it to materialize so quickly. What are you? I want you to come back, I want us to be together again. Oh god, you are much worse, aren't you? Oh, it has nothing to do with my health, I just, with whatever time we have left, I wanna spend it with each other. I love you. I've always loved you, always. Whatever has happened, whatever will happen, I have never and I never will make a fool of you, but I won't let you make a fool of yourself either. Is that what you think I'm doing? You're still drinking. Two years, I've not... Don't, don't. Do you know how many times I've heard that? I mean, I'm happy for you, if it's true, I hope it goes on and on. Thank you for the prayer at dinner, from the bottom of my heart. And from that same place , no, thank you. How sick are you? God willing, I'll tell ya tomorrow. She's so sweet. Marty. We can't, we can't. You want me to sleep on the chair? You want me to tell you where to sleep? Jesus Christ. What I want is for you to remind yourself that what you say and do has an affect on my daughter. Our daughter. Our. Thanks so much. I'm aware of that. She sounds like trash, it's embarrassing. What do you think my mother is gonna think... She's imitating you. Marty, she was sneaking. In the street with who knows who all hours of the night. And I'm to blame for that? Sure as shit didn't seem to bother you at the moment. You didn't even mention it to me. More importantly, you didn't say a word to her. She's you daughter, and you just ignored it. Then, the ever Mr. Clever shows up, and what, you decided to use it to cut a deal with her. Like you were selling real estate. Which you went along with. I'm not gonna fight. 'Cause even you know when you're wrong. - Wrong? - Yes. Wrong, what a bitchin' tattoo on her back. You're doin' such a bang up job - with our daughter. - Oh, nice. Teaching her. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, it's okay. - Right. - You got it. Guess what, Luana is still suffering, she's still confused. Why do you think that is? Her delirious mother. No, Martin, face it. It is her lying, cheating... Bullshit, blinded, one-way mind, just shut it. Oh, you are in my dad's house. He is dying. Luana's having some sort of breakdown. You're having a breakdown. Fuck off. Calling me delirious, no, no, no, you don't get to do that, you don't, not this time. You don't get to just wave your hands and walk away not talking because things get tough or uncomfortable. You deal with it, Martin, deal with it. You're driving us away. You're driving our daughter and me away because you can't make a choice. Make a choice. Make a choice. Make a choice! Stop. What are you gonna do, huh, huh, Martin? I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna quit. What? I'm gonna leave. We should, I know. I know, baby. Honey. It's okay, sh, sh, sh, sh. Bad dream. - Bad. - What, what, what, baby, what, what, what? It was um, it was the guy with the truck, and the tattoos around his eyes, he killed her. The girl who wrote with lipstick on the mirror. What'd she say? Dad, please. I'll warm some milk. It's okay. It's okay. What's all that stuff about a truck? Oh, it was something that happened on the way. She saw something, said she saw something, it was alarming. She's hurting, me and her. Tasha will get her to sleep. Do you think this is about that lipstick on the mirror? No, no. It's about Tasha and me. We've been separated for a couple months now. Three to be exact. And we weren't gonna, we were gonna not talk about it under the circumstances. But, Luana knew. Yeah, Luana of course knew. And I stupidly talked her into not telling you because of something that she did. But we're broke it off and, looks like it'll probably be permanent. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry. Kiddo. It's over. It's really over. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Hugh, at the risk of being even more of an asshole than I've already been, do you have anything to drink? You sure? Sure, I'm sure that if I was young enough I'd probably try to kick your ass. That was pretty ugly up there. She was hitting me, I, never again. Go ahead, open it, it's good bourbon. I'm not young enough. It has nothin' to do with you or Tasha, I'm two years sober, man. You got a lotta nerve asking me for a drink. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Well tell that to Tasha. Ah? You're sober? Once a week I go into town and shop, get a haircut, see a doctor. And the last thing I do is I go by the liquor store and I pick up a pint of booze, I keep it in the cabinet right there. And it lives with me here, three, four days, and then one night I take it out and I smash it against a tree, a rock, tractor, I destroy it. And as I do that, I howl at the moon like a dog, and that coordinated effort proves to me that I am in control of my life. I don't drink alcohol. And I know that may sound like some demented ritual of an unbalanced individual, but then stupidity is the most natural of all human qualities. Like body sweat. That's your message from the holy land? Amen, sister. Since we're doing revelations night on the mountain, why don't you just tell us how sick you are, Dad. My kidneys are in a permanent state of anarchy. My liver, however, God only knows why, is steadfast, my ticker's strong. So basically, you lied to get us here. No. When can we meet with doctor um... Belmaraz. Belmaraz? When she's back in town. She, I thought it was a, oh, when is she back? Any day now, I'll call her. Well, at least one purpose was served. Hugh, I can leave now if you... Brilliant, that's good. Why don't you do that, Marty? Why don't you drink and drive at night in the mountains. - Sh, sh, sh, sh. - That's a really - good thought, smart. - Sh! Could you guys stop this. How's Luana feeling about all this? Luana wants to go into town and text her friends, that's all she wants, period. She obviously knows about us breaking up. She honored it by getting a tattoo on her back. Of what? Oh, you know, I would never say that I liked you better drunk, but... What, it's on her back, what is it? A bird. What do you mean a bird? What, an eagle, a parrot, what... - Dad, what does it matter? - A seagull. 12-year-old girl. Well somebody oughta go to jail. Who, maybe Luana? Mom. Well, it's her back. She's 12 years old. It's her back. Okay, well, she also snuck out last night. Last night? Yes, she and her friend and some boy I don't know snuck out and they snuck back in. You caught her? She's already on probation for foul language. And the lipstick on the mirror? I don't know, that's even, that's even more disturbing, - I, I don't... - Mystery truck and lipstick. No good. Shut up, Marty. She was wearing lipstick. Well maybe, could it have been in her purse or maybe in her suitcase? Yeah. I'm not gonna go through her things, I'm just gonna ask her. Goodnight. Will I see you in the morning? Son of a bitch. Here you go. Okay. Edward, Ed, Eddie. Come on Sybil, come on girl, hey. - Hey, how are ya? - Hey there, Aubrey. Good morning, Sybil. Here you go. Oh. Hey, good morning, Luana. Hey, beauty. Good morning. - You hungry? - Yeah. Um, is Dad okay? In the pink, he's fine. Wanna scramble some eggs? Yeah. Yeah, I told you that you could scramble eggs. She said, "No, she can't, "but even if she could, she wouldn't." I hear you wanna get online. Yes. Okay, so at the bottom of the drive, you're gonna turn left. And after awhile there's a Mexican restaurant all by itself on the highway called Mona's. Thank you. Morning. Hi. Sweetheart, were you able to get back to sleep okay? Yes, I'm, I'm sorry for... Oh, honey. Nothing worse than a nightmare in a strange bedroom. Well, I beg to differ. Yeah? Yeah. Scramble, scramble, scramble, scramble. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. I think um, maybe you should go. I can drive Luana and my mom back tomorrow. Rent a car, take a bus, catch a train. I know how. Goodbye, Bettye Sue. Take care of yourself. I'm gonna pick up some. Hey. I know you're upset. I just want you to know how much I love you. I know, Daddy. Hey, you've never ridden a train before have you? No. No. Well, you know what? I used to love to ride. I can't wait to take a trip with you. When Grandma Marcie and I, and Dad used to go from Eugene to Los Angeles, I would sleep in the upper bunk, it was so much fun. And I would go to the last car, stand there and I'd just watch the track disappear. The conductor would let me stand there and I'd just watch the tracks disappear, around a bend or on a straightaway, and think about all the places that I'd been and, I couldn't wait to see where we'd land when the train stopped and we all got off. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. You're gonna see me a lot more now than you have in that last few weeks, I promise. By phone, text, Skype. We'll take a train trip. Good. You are my angel. You're the only one that I've ever met, the only one I ever will meet. Promise me you'll be good, always. - I promise, Daddy. - I love you. Thank you. You okay? I'm fine. You wanna go home, I mean to my place? Um, I wanna go to Mona's, get online. How far is it? Do they have wifi? Yep, hang on. Look at how they strut. Hm, and some of 'em look lost. Where am I? Where am I going? I know you like chicken, buddy, but some of 'em seem to love life so much. Hey. Oh, hi. I asked Tasha if she wanted to check out the place but she just wanted to hang out in the house. She's pretty much a city girl. Yeah, me too before I met Hugh. Where, where did you meet him? AA, D.C. and Charlottesville. Ah, we lived in D.C. a long time. That's pretty much where we raised our kids. Yeah, Hugh told me all about it. And, I know how much he misses you, and family. How's he doin', Jimmie? He's superb, how 'bout you? Good. Is your last name Belmaraz? No. How are you doin'? Do you know the password? Cantina. Thanks. Please, I need to make a call, it's an emergency. No, no. It's a matter of life and death. Si. Hugh,. Si,. Si, si, si. Thanks, Grandpy. We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in use. Guys, put the vehicles in position, trucks and police cars. Come on guys, we gotta shoot. Thank you, come right out. John, are you ready, we gotta shoot. Guys, talk to me, are you in position? Guys, we got vehicles in position. Bring the back hooks in. All right, guys, put yours up. Very good, let's roll sound. Let's roll sound. And roll camera. Let's roll camera. Rolling. We're set then, call it to her. Action. Action! Let me see your hands! Drop the weapon. Drop the weapon! Drop your weapon, now! - Drop the weapon, now! - Do it! Do it now. Back off! - Drop the weapon. - Drop your weapon. Back off or she's dead! Drop it. And that's a cut! Well, we still have it though. Did you write on the mirror with lipstick? What? Did you write on the mirror that he broke your teeth and nose? Luana. Super. Worked out great. Was he gonna kill you? Is this a gag? Mistaken, mistaken identity. Hey, are you following me, hm? Are you following me, huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're old friends, remember me? I'm an actor. Well, that's weird. Don't leave her. I won't. Who? Everybody's going away. I'm not, I'm here with ya. What's going on? Oh they're making a movie, sure, great, but I, I wanna know, I wanna know why my parents are breaking up. I can't tell what, I don't know, I don't know anymore. It's not easy, Luana, it's not graceful, and they're making a movie but, the girl's the nose, her teeth aren't broken. I mean that guy's not gonna kill her, he's just an actor playing his part. My friend, Jalla, is going away. She's really leaving me, really. My best friend in the whole wide world and there's nothing I can do about it. My parents are really breaking up, and I can't do anything about it. You can't control other people's lives. Why? That's just the way the world is made. I mean, there's no guarantees, you never know, ever. You know, I, I wanted Bettye Sue, Grammy, to come be with me. I could see us, I can see us together forever but, she can't, she doesn't, she won't. I mean you just, you never know. That's sad. Well, it's not happy. I want things to be happy. I wanna know what that would be like. You'll make things so happy, so groovy. How would I? Well it's not even a question of how would you, you just, you go with the flow, which you learn to love. I mean, when you're young, you dream of the future. When you're old, you dream of the past. Hey, making a movie, huh? Yeah, you saw what I wrote on the mirror? Uh, yeah. Props or set dressing didn't wipe it off. It's just a flick, girl. I'm so sorry for the confusion. Please accept my apologies. Yeah, I hope we didn't ruin the take. No, we got exactly what we wanted. Well, if you wanna come back we've got a couple more scenes. Yeah, and then come to the wrap party, eh? Uh, we're, we're, we're gonna go home and see what the family wants to do and then, or see what Luana wants to do. And, thank you. Thank you. That could be a lot of fun. Yeah. Thanks. You kept saying back there, "Don't leave her." Who is that, her? Is that your friend, Jalla? Listen to me, you have things inside of you, nobody knows what you've got but you. That's the one thing you can be sure of. Me too, I got things you don't know. I mean, you, my granddaughter, don't know what I got inside of me. Maybe I'm not that sick. Maybe I'm not quite ready to ride. We all keep secrets, we all hide. But if we hide all the time and we pretend to be somebody else all of the time, how can anybody find us? Nobody knows what I got, except a lot of love for Luana Cole. Wow, a movie. I feel so stupid. Oh. Honey, will you forgive me? I completely doubted you, I hate that, I'm sorry. That's okay. I once believed the moon in the river was real. Trust me, you may be a lotta things, darling, and you'll grow up to be a whole lot more. But stupid, isn't one of 'em. Maybe the moon was in the river. Tash, don't put my stuff in the car for tomorrow, um, I think I'll stay, for awhile anyway. What'd I tell you? What did I tell you? Oh my god, oh my god. Everything okay? Uh, perfect. Grammy, could I ask you a favor? You can ask a favor of me. Could you say something, could you say something to Mom so I could go to a movie on Saturday? By yourself? With a friend. Boy? Boy. Mm, maybe. Maybe we'll introduce him to your mom. Hi. Would you like to come dance with everyone? It's okay. You've come a long way for this flood of pain, all shared. I have to get back to the looney tune that I love. And you didn't drown, but you have told many, many lies. I was very sick, love sick. Now I'm better. All's fair in love and war. Well, I'm glad to hear it, and I'm proud of you. But precious man, if you ever decide to quit me, don't throw me up against a tree or a tractor, okay? I won't. And I won't. If I ever decide to quit you, I'll keep it a secret. - Bye-bye now. - Bye, Grammy. - Now you got reason - Love you. To come more often, love you. - It's great to meet you. - Thank you, take care. Bye sweetie. - Bye, take care. - Bye. Come on, Aubrey. All right, drive safe. How old is he? 13. What's his name? Edward. Edward.
