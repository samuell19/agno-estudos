He loves that old camera. Come on, Yang. YANG: One second. Don't forget to join us. YANG: I will. Look here for a second. What are you doing? Come on. Come on, gege. -(CAMERA CLICKS) -(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) JAKE: Yellow Equinox. Is that a new blend? WOMAN: I think so. I'm sure I can make you something close to it. Do you know what kind of tea leaves? Oh, no. No, no. It's not this kind of tea. I'm looking for your crystallized teas. Ah. Sorry, I... I don't carry tea crystals. How can you be a tea shop and not carry tea crystals? (SIGHS) How frustrating. Why don't you let me make you something that might be close? No. No, no, no. This is... I have to go. Thanks for coming in. MIKA: When's Daddy coming home? KYRA: Soon. He's always late. Well, I'm late sometimes, too. And, you know, I've got a busy few weeks coming up, so... I know. Yang will be here. So will Daddy. Mika. Mika? Don't be too hard on him. He told me there was a rush of customers towards the end of the day. That's good news for Daddy. He needed that. KYRA: I loved that meal. Did you like the gochujang sauce? -JAKE: I did. -I made it. JAKE: You mentioned that. It was her first time. So you put the ingredients in the bowl and you mixed them all together? -Yeah. -(JAKE CHUCKLES) It's good, huh? It was really wonderful, mei mei. Thank you. Next time, I'm gonna Juliet the carrots. Julienne. And no, you're not. (VIOLIN PLAYING) Mika's growing up so fast. (MUFFLED VIOLIN CONTINUES PLAYING) She keeps asking why we're always busy. She understands. -And Yang is... -No, she doesn't. (SIGHS) I feel like... I don't know. I... I don't want to regret. Um... Um, I'll make more time. I will. I promise. You know I'm not putting this on you, right? Hmm. Sort of. -I'm not. -I'm teasing. I just want us to be a team. A family. -(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) -Starting Ignite Starting Reset Starting Ignite Starting Reset Starting Starting Starting Starting HOST: (OVER SPEAKER) Welcome, families of four, to our monthly dance-off.

MIKA: Yang! JAKE: Yang? JAKE: It looks like we have three years left on the warranty, but they're not answering, so... KYRA: Can't you just go there? JAKE: Yeah, I'm going to, but I don't know if the store is even there anymore. I did a search. I can't find them anywhere. Did you call Brothers &amp; Sisters? We didn't buy from them directly, so... KYRA: They won't honor the warranty? No, the warranty is with Second Siblings. (SIGHS SOFTLY) I told you we should've just bought a new one. He was new. I mean, practically. He's refurbished. Certified refurbished. And he'd only been in use for five days. Five days. -And we saved... -But now he... Never mind. Let's just get him fixed. Yeah. You need to get Mika to school. Mika, come on, we need to go! Mika? -Mika? -What happened to Yang? Oh, hi. Um... I don't know. He... He shut down last night. Won't restart. -Has this happened before? -No. You got a technician? He's still under warranty. I wouldn't take him back to Brothers &amp; Sisters. They're just going to try to get you to recycle him for a new model. You know why. I'm not taking him there. The warranty's with another store. You didn't buy him direct? No. No, uh, he's certified. I have to go and get Mika. Oh, Mika's still here? Did she see Yang all dead-eyed? -I bet it freaked her out. -Yeah. Listen, I got a technician in Woodbury. It's worth the trek. I'm going to send you his info. No, I'll just... I'll take him to Quick Fix if I can't figure it out. That place is for morons. Don't take him there. My guy will fix him for a third of the cost. You tell Russ I sent ya. Okay. Okay, got to go. Thank you. Mika? Mika? Come on, kiddo, we gotta boogie. I don't want to go to school. I want to be with Yang. Mika, the longer we wait, the worse it's gonna be for Yang. What do you mean? He'll start decomposing. What? Come on, we gotta go. Mika, now. FYI, Mika's going to be with me for the day. KYRA: Why? What happened? JAKE: Well, you know, she just refused and I wasn't gonna drag her inside. KYRA: Mika? (MIKA GROANS) KYRA: Answer me. Mom, I can't. I want to be with Yang. KYRA: It's okay, darling. I just wanted to hear your voice. You need to listen to Dad and be good and calm, okay? MIKA: Is Yang going to be better? Yes, he's gonna be... KYRA: Well, we don't know for sure, but... What do you mean? Yeah, what do you mean? KYRA: We can't make any promises, but, Mika, listen, if you can be good and calm for the rest of the day, I'm gonna bring you a surprise. What? You just promised her a surprise. MIKA: What is it, Mom? KYRA: That's different. Mom, what is it? KYRA: I wasn't trying to... I appreciate you taking the day off. MIKA: Mom? KYRA: Honey, be good and listen to Dad. Oh, I need to go. I have to get ready for my presentation. We'll talk. (CALL ENDS) What is she gonna get me, Dad? I have no idea. MIKA: I think I know. Just don't get your hopes up for anything specific. (WHISPERS) Gege, I know what she's gonna get me. JAKE: Excuse me? -Excuse me? -Can I help you? Yeah, I was wondering if you could... I purchased a... This used to be a store where you could buy, uh, an older sibling for Chinese adoptions. It was called Second Siblings. We sell fish and tanks. Yeah, I can see, but do you know what happened to that shop? Before my store, they sold memory. Memory-balia. Is that how you say it, memory-balia? -Memorabilia. -Memorabilia. Yeah, memories. But no technos? No, I'm not sure what it was before that. All right, thank you. Mika? Mika. Mika, come on, let's go. I want a fish. (WHISPERS) Gege? Meet Puffy. Uh, it's a black box issue, okay? Uh, so by law, we're not allowed to tamper with the, uh, core interior, unfortunately. So what is it that you do here? Uh, well, we are certified with Brothers &amp; Sisters, Incorporated, to repair or replace up to 12 parts most commonly in need of service. If you want to take a gander there at the 12-point diagnostic. Yeah, but your diagnostics is just... Um, well, we hooked up Yang to our certified analyzer, and, uh, all 12 parts were in working order, however, the readout did indicate that there was a core malfunction, unfortunately, so... So what? So there's nothing you can do? Oh, there's a couple things we can do here. Um, we can have him recycled at Brothers &amp; Sisters. Uh, if you do so before he begins to decompose, you'll get $1,000 off on a new model, which is great. Uh, if you don't want to have him recycled, which I completely understand, um, we are equipped to turn his head and his voice box into a virtual assistant, and we'd salvage the remaining parts for ya. What? But we would have to send the core to, uh, Brothers &amp; Sisters. No, no, no. That's not gonna happen. Now, just give him back to me, and I'll get a second opinion. Oh, sure. Of course. Uh, so that'll be 250 for the diagnostics, please. You're kidding me. Unfortunately, no. (INDISTINCT, ANIMATED CHATTER) KYRA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) That doesn't sound good. JAKE: I know. What did you tell Mika? I said we were getting a second opinion. It's already taken longer than I expected. MIKA: Daddy? KYRA: Hi, Mika. MIKA: Hi. KYRA: Are you okay? No. I got a fish. KYRA: You did? -She did? -MIKA: Yeah. Yeah, it's a little... I'll explain later. We're almost there. KYRA: All right. Keep me posted. Okay. KYRA: Bye, Mika. Bye. Say bye to Yang. KYRA: Bye, Yang. RUSS: It is an interior core problem. JAKE: Yeah, we knew that already. I need your permission to break open the core. -It's against the law. -(LAUGHING) It's just... It's a bunch of corporate bullshit. Do you know who made that a law? Brothers &amp; Sisters. They're just trying to protect their spyware. You recycle that, they will have so much data on your family, it'll make your head spin. JAKE: I'm not interested. Your loss. You promised to fix him. Mika, I said wait outside. You said he was gonna be fine. Come on, man. You gotta make a decision. KYRA: Maybe this is a good thing. JAKE: How is this a good thing? Yang has been... Yang has been wonderful. And we'd all miss him terribly, (SIGHS) but we've been over-reliant on him. We bought Yang to connect Mika to her Chinese heritage, not to raise her. Yeah, but we spent a lot of money on Yang. I mean, I'm not gonna... ...you know, feel bad if he does more for Mika than teach her Chinese fun facts. He does a lot more than that, but you're missing the point. What's the point? If we can't fix Yang, we're not gonna buy another sibling for Mika. That would just be... strange. And we can't afford it anyway. So we need to be more involved. More than we are now. And not just in raising her, in connecting Mika to her culture and heritage. Like, that will be on us. So we need to be ready and willing. (TRANQUIL MUSIC PLAYING) YANG: Mei mei, what's wrong? MIKA: Nothing. YANG: Your face says something different. MIKA: Just some kids. In your class? No, kids at recess. They were asking about my real parents. I see. And what did you say? MIKA: I told them about Mom and Dad, and they said, "No, your real parents." They said Mom and Dad weren't really my parents. Not really. Do you believe them? I mean, they're our parents, but... we're not, you know, they're not... Not really. YANG: Mei mei. Here it is. Take a look at this. Is the tree hurt? No. Something wonderful is happening here. What? You see, this branch is from a different tree. It is? Yes, but now it's becoming an actual part of this tree. Not really, though. It's just pretend. Why do you say that? Because it's just taped to the tree. Oh, right. It looks like that, doesn't it? Here, let's find one that's already attached. Mei mei. See this branch? This branch is also from another tree. But look, you're connected to Mom and Dad, just like this branch. You're a part of the family tree. For real. Then so are you. Why do they do it? Why do they move branches to different trees? It's called grafting. They do it to make something new. Some of the apples you love were produced by combining different trees. It's an ancient technique that was used in China over 4,000 years ago. -A Chinese fun fact. -YANG: Yes. But you should know that both trees are important. Not just this one, but the one from this branch, too. Your other family tree is also a vital part of who you are. Do you understand? MIKA: I want to go with Dad. No, kiddo, you need to go to school today. MIKA: But Yang! I wanna see Yang! Hey, what about your Pup-Pup? Don't you want to show your friends? MIKA: Yang. Yang's gonna be home soon. MIKA: Is he better? We'll see. KYRA: But you need to go to school. Yang would want that. Do it for gege. He'd want me to show my Pup-Pup. -KYRA: Mm-hmm. -All right, I'm heading out. Okay. Let me know how it goes. JAKE: Will do. KYRA: Your bag. Come on. (CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) (TRANQUIL MUSIC PLAYING) RUSS: We've always known that some bots are equipped with spyware. Especially the foreign ones. And now we have proof. Now? So you've never seen these before. What does it matter? It is what it is. Have you looked at the recordings? No. No! I'm pro-privacy. Can I see what's on here? You'll need a special reader. The connectors, they're nothing I've seen before. (CHUCKLES) This is some high-level shit, man. I mean, this is... Sorry, I'm... I'm just trying to wrap my head around it. -It's disturbing. -Yes. It is disturbing. It's time to wake up, man. (JAKE SIGHS) So how do I buy a reader that I can see what's on this? No one's selling a reader for that. You'll have to have one specifically modified for those connectors. Great. Okay, I'm gonna give you a name. There's no number, but this is where you find them. How much do I owe you? Like I said, I get paid to fix things. Thank you. I guess I'll take Yang back. I'll tell you what. Why don't... Why don't you look what's on there first? If it's something bad, disturbing, (CHUCKLES) you might not want this bot in your house anymore. You can take him, but also, he's gonna start decomposing. You won't get as much value for him. I can keep him hooked up on the simulator until you know more. You're a friend of George, right? Yeah. MAN: (ON SPEAKER) Sorry, she's in a meeting, but I'd be happy to pass on a message. Yeah, could you just tell her... Uh, hello? Are you still there? You know what, it's all right. I'll talk to her later. Great. Should I have her call you back? No. No, it's all right. Thank you. (CALL ENDS) JAKE: I was told I could talk to you. I was looking for Max Walker, but they mentioned... WOMAN: Oh, I'm not interested. JAKE: Sorry? WOMAN: Are you here to talk some conspiracy shit? JAKE: No. No, Russ told me that I could... WOMAN: Russ? Oh, man, you're one of them. I can't believe they let you back here. JAKE: I'm not one of them. I... I have this. I was told Max might be able to help me with it. WOMAN: What is that? Russ said it's spyware. Where did you find it? It was inside Yang. And... he's our... (INHALES SHAKILY) We bought him after we adopted our daughter. She's Chinese. Mm-hmm. And my neighbor recommended Russ after Yang shut down, and Russ broke in... Can I... Sorry. Can I? Yeah, sure. Holy shit, this isn't spyware. I'm pretty sure it's a memory bank. The memory banks allowed the technos to record a few seconds each day. The labs were trying to understand what technos considered memorable. But the research was uncovered, the whole project was shut down immediately for violating privacy laws. JAKE: So what do I do? Oh, I'm not gonna lie. This... This is a big deal. If it's the regulator, then Russ is right. He's not gonna turn on. I'm just being honest with you. But his existence, Yang's existence would be an invaluable contribution to this museum and just to the whole understanding of techno-sapiens. So I guess the real question's gonna be, what do we pay you to have Yang and his memories in our collection? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) JAKE: Could I have another one of these, please? (AIR ON THE G STRING PLAYING ON SPEAKER) (ELECTRONIC CHIMING) JAKE: Answer call. -Hey. -JAKE: Hey. How's Mika? She's next door. Next door? At George's? KYRA: Yep. Why? Because you're not here, and I have work to do. I'm taking care of Yang. KYRA: Is that what you're doing? Yes. So you just dropped her off over there? No, his daughters invited her over to play. You need to stop being so hard on George. He likes you, and he's being really helpful. His kids are clones. I don't want to talk about this again. And he paints his face for sporting events. -What is wrong with you? -What's wrong with him? You need to stop. Okay? (SIGHS) How's the ramen? It's, um, soothing. Yeah, I can see that. What are you having? Ramen. Really? That's funny. KYRA: Is it? Sort of, don't you think? Are you any closer to getting Yang fixed? This is the third place you've taken him to. Well, he's actually still at the repair shop. I'm, uh, having a part examined. By a specialist. So is he gonna be up and running again soon? I'm not sure. You know, it's... it's complicated. (DOOR THUDS) That's Mika. I got to go. Functions like any other reader. Should be intuitive. Do I need a code? Yeah, there should be a certification card that came with Yang. There's a serial number and a pin on it. Also, per our agreement, you'll need to bring Yang's body here tomorrow. -Sooner the better. -Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if Russ is trying to replace parts and steal the originals. We will keep Yang's body preserved here in a bio-state while you go and review the memories and decide what you want to do next. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I've dedicated my life to understanding techno-sapiens. This... This is a gift. (DOOR THUDS) MIKA: (SINGING) I want to be Just like the wind Just flowing in the air Flowing in open space KYRA: Yang taught you that? MIKA: Uh-huh. It's his favorite song. -Do you like it? -(KYRA CHUCKLES) KYRA: I love it. Hey. Mika's up late. She couldn't sleep. You going somewhere? Brenda's meeting me at the office. We're gonna stay overnight and work. We're behind. JAKE: Sorry I wasn't here earlier. It's fine. You'll need to take Mika to school and get her ready for the day. Do you think you can do that? Yeah, of course. All right. (SIGHS) I need to go. Are we... Are we okay? So what did the part reveal? The part? The part. The specialist? Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. Um... You... We should know something soon. I need to go. JAKE: Try and get some sleep if you can. (DOOR SLIDES OPEN) (DOOR CLOSES) Serial 733951137CM99. Pin 279321.

(WHISPERING) Is it boring you to tears? (LAUGHS) Hey... Let's get you some water. MIKA: I'll do it. JAKE: Okay. Is this something you do? Do you get yourself water in the middle of the night? Gege usually comes with me. Is that right? So you'd wake him up? Does he sleep? JAKE: No, I don't think so. I usually just say, (WHISPERS) "Gege." Not very loudly because he can hear me even when I whisper. I say, (WHISPERS) "Gege, I want to get some water." Then he joins me in the hallway, and we walk quietly to the kitchen. (JAKE LAUGHS) Why don't you just ask him to get you a glass of water? Then you can stay in bed. I like getting my own water. RUSS: What do you mean you want him back? JAKE: I mean I want him back. Did Max make the reader for you? Max isn't there anymore. -Where is he? -I don't know. I bet they took him. Ah! I can't believe they finally got him. Please, just let me have Yang back. -(TOOL CLATTERS) -I want an explanation. (RUSS BREATHES HEAVILY) Yang belongs to us. I... don't need to give you an explanation. (LOW SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) It'll be all right. CLEO: God, I love cultural technos. And since they're used for adoptions and language learning, they haven't had to change much over the years. No need to be faster or stronger. There's some damage here. Damn Russ just hacked his way into the core. There's a proper way of opening it. So if you don't mind, we're just gonna do a full check-up, and we're gonna restore Yang as best we can. Oh, that would be great. It won't help with his off state, but it should help with his preservation. (INDISTINCT ELECTRONIC CHATTER) JAKE: Play. Repeat. Play.

JAKE: Do you mean the taste of tea? YANG: Maybe. Is the taste why you like tea? JAKE: It has something to do with it. YANG: Is it why you've given your life to tea? JAKE: Given my life to tea, well, that sounds pretty serious. Is it not serious? I guess I've acquired a taste for tea. But it's not why I became interested. Interested. I think what I was really drawn to at the beginning was... I think what I was really drawn to at the beginning was the idea of tea. The idea of tea. The idea of tea. Yeah, I saw this old documentary when I was in college. It was from the 20th century. And it was about this man searching for the best tea in China. It's about a man searching for the best tea in China. China is where tea started. Yes, I'm sure you have lots of interesting facts about tea in China. I do. Would you like to hear some of them? Maybe another time. I'm sorry, you were saying about the man searching for tea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, actually, I think that's it. I think it was his searching that compelled me. You know, the pursuit of this illusive thing, this process that was connected to the soil, to the plants, to the weather, and to a way of life. To a way of life. So that's what you like about tea? The search, not so much the taste. No, no, no, the taste, too. (LAUGHING) There's this, uh... There's this part in the film, it's a great part, where the man is explaining to his German friend why it's so difficult for him to describe the taste of tea. He says, "There's no language for it. "There are no words to adequately express "the mysterious nature of tea." And his German friend, who's just standing right beside him with a cup of tea, says, (IN GERMAN ACCENT) "Yes, but I imagine things "like you are walking through a forest, "and there are leaves on the ground, "and it just had rained, and the rain has stopped, "and it's damp, and you walk, "and somehow, that is all in this tea." (IN NORMAL TONE) I mean, I loved that so much. (LAUGHS) I loved that so much. "Somehow, that is all in this tea." "Somehow, that is all in this tea." God, I watched it over and over again. God, I watched it over and over again. I would like to watch this movie. Well, maybe we can do it together. Yes. That would be nice. So do you believe it? JAKE: What's that? That a cup of tea can contain a world? That you could taste a place, a time? JAKE: Let's put it to the test, shall we? So you want to smell it first. You know, there's not just flavor and the aroma, there's history, too. You know, traditionally, tea shops that were family businesses passed down from one generation to an... Were passed down from... ...generation to, you know this, from generation to generation. Maybe it's time I started teaching you the trade. Let's see if we can taste the world together. Drink it all at once. What did you think? I'm not sure if I can taste the forest. YANG: Do you taste anything? (CLICKS TONGUE) Maybe I haven't the language for it. I wish Chinese tea wasn't just about facts for me. What do you mean? I like watching the way you make tea. It's very beautiful. The way the leaves bloom and float and fall. I wish I felt something deeper about tea. I wish I had a real memory of tea in China. Of a place. Of a time. I think this would... What? Sorry. I lost my train of thought. Are you happy, Yang? YANG: I don't know if that's the question for me. I don't know if that's the question for me. JAKE: Repeat.

No. And you don't know her name. No. Yeah. Then I don't either. Sorry. GEORGE: Hey. JAKE: Hey, George. GEORGE: What do you need? I was wondering if you'd ever seen her around the house. I... Who is she? I don't know, but Yang knew her. Really? Huh. I... I didn't know that bots, uh... That techno beings could make friends on their own. -They were just... -I... I don't know anything, I just want to find her. GEORGE: Hmm. Let me ask the girls. Maybe they know something. Please. Thank you. Ladies, I need to see you. VICKY: What is it? Just get over here. And bring the twins. Vicky just made the all-star softball team. You gotta come watch. I mean, she's just great. Nice. What is it? Mr. Fleming wants to know if you've seen her around. Are you sure? Can we go? Yeah. Go ahead. How about you? Is she in trouble? -I don't... -No. No, not at all. How's Yang? He's not so good. You know, I think finding her, it might help. Yeah, I've seen her. You have? A couple times. At your place. Did you ever talk to her? Once. Yang asked me not to say anything. Why? You don't like clones, right? -No, no, it's not... -Come on, Vic. No fastballs. I just... I've never had the... -It's... It's fine. -No, it's not. GEORGE: Vicky. She's a clone. JAKE: She is? Yeah, but she's really cool and nice. Like most of us. I'm sure.

Jake, do you hear me? If we can't get Yang fixed, we just... we need to move forward. Okay? Now. Now. JAKE: I need to tell you something. JAKE: No, it's... it's frozen. That's interesting. Try command "memory reveal info," and it should tell you if it's corrupt or not. Okay, I'll do that. Also, I was wondering, is it possible for cultural technos like Yang to want to have romantic potential? Do you mean for humans to use them? No, no, no, I mean, for Yang to be interested in... There's a girl, and she showed up in his memories, and, you know, we didn't know anything about her. Really? That's fascinating, because I've never heard of cultural technos having that capacity. I cannot tell you how much... -(DOORBELL CHIMES) -...Yang and his memories... I should get that. Oh, all right, okay. But we'll touch base soon? -JAKE: Yeah, let's do that. -Great. (DOORBELL CHIMES) WOMAN: You've been looking for me? Yes. I'm Jake. I know. I'm Ada. Ada. Well, come in, please. I knew something was wrong. We usually meet, and he wasn't answering my messages. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know Yang loves being a part of this family. Can I ask how you met? At the coffee shop. He approached you? He was a regular customer. He used to buy things all the time, which, you know, was funny when I found out he was a techno. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) But, yeah, we started talking, and... eventually, he asked me if I wanted to do something. Were you and Yang... Were you guys... (CHUCKLES) Well, we never really talked about us in that way. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Sorry, that's... That's my wife. I need to... (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) -Yeah. -Sorry. Please... don't leave. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING CONTINUES) She's freaking out. You need to pick her up. What's she doing? They said she punched a kid, and then she started screaming at everyone. -Holy shit. -Are you able to get her now? Yeah. Uh, yeah. I'm on my way. (SIGHS) Thank you. I want to see him. ADA: Mika... Yang loves you so much. He always talks about you. (MIKA CRIES) JAKE: Thanks again for this. CLEO: Oh, I understand. I'm sure everyone misses him a lot. Mika. MIKA: Gege. Gege. JAKE: I'm sorry, baby. MIKA: Gege! (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) He would have his own area. We could put some of his memories on a loop, projected, or on a set of readers that visitors could wear. Of course, any memory would have to be approved by you. (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Yang. KYRA: Play. (SIGHS) KYRA: Your collection is growing. Oh, hi. Yes, it's getting bigger. Do you want me to stop now? I can put some away. No, no. I'm not complaining. (CHUCKLES) I like them quite a bit. Do you know butterflies were one of the favorite subjects of Chinese trade art in the mid-1800s? No, I did not know that. YANG: The Chinese love butterflies. There's also a famous folk tale about two lovers who die of broken hearts and reemerge as butterflies. Also, the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, "What the caterpillar calls the end, "the rest of the world calls a butterfly." (LAUGHS) I like that. I like that. (LAUGHS) Is this something you believe? -Hmm? -That the end... That the end is also a beginning? ...is also the beginning? For the caterpillar... For the caterpillar, yes. But do you believe it's true for all things? I don't know. I'm not programmed to believe in that way. What about you? I'd like to believe that. -Do you? -(LAUGHS) YANG: Do you? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Sometimes I think humans are programmed to believe in such things, but... I don't know if it's really in our best interest. May I be honest with you? Yes. Wait, is... Is not being honest an option for you? I don't think so. (LAUGHS) Hmm. Go on. I'm fine if there's nothing in the end. Are you? Maybe I was programmed this way as well. Does it ever make you feel sad? (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) Um... There's no something without nothing. Does it ever make you feel sad? There's no something without nothing. KYRA: Lao Tzu? I'm not sure. JAKE: Did Yang ever struggle with being a techno? What do you mean? I mean, did he ever... want to be human? (CHUCKLES) JAKE: What? Nothing. It's just... That's such a human thing to ask, isn't it? We always assume that other beings would want to be human. What's so great about being human? So he never struggled with it? He never... Questioned it? ADA: Not to me. I see. He did question if he was Chinese. JAKE: He did? Yeah. What makes someone Asian? He'd ask that all the time. Maybe he just wanted to help Mika understand what it means to be Chinese. He was dedicated to his little sister. Yeah, Yang was a good brother. He's a great brother. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (RAIN FALLING) JAKE: Reveal file info. READER: Wrong command. Try again.

(BABY CRYING IN OTHER ROOM) JAKE: Zoom in. Coordinates. Hello. JAKE: Hi, uh, could I speak to the owners? Uh, yes. One moment. NANCY: He wasn't just quiet. He seemed despondent. Broken. We took him back a few days later, and they let us make an exchange. Brothers &amp; Sisters? No, it was, uh... Well, I can't remember the name. We didn't buy him new. You didn't? No, but he was certified. Second Siblings. Maybe. Is that in Chinatown? Yeah, it used to be. I assume he was on when you bought him in a sleep state? That sounds right. (JAKE SIGHS) JAKE: Extract alpha. READER: There is not enough space. Would you like to compress beta or gamma? Compress beta. Beta compressed. Extract alpha. READER: There is not enough space. Would you like to compress gamma? Compress gamma. Gamma is compressing. Gamma compressed. JAKE: Extract alpha. (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) (BABY CRIES) (BABY COOS) YANG: Di-di. Ni hao, di-di! Di-di, wake up. Di-di. Is everything okay? WOMAN: We're going to miss you. (CRYING) ADA: Hi, we're here to help Emma Davidson. YANG: Yes, come in. ADA: Slowly bring it down. Side to side. Good. YANG: Your niece is going to like me. Hey. Let's go get Yang. Come here. Go get him. -YANG: You better not. -(LAUGHING) (LAUGHS) Can I tell you something? Come on! (SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) ADA: She was my great aunt. JAKE: Your original? ADA: So Yang knew her? JAKE: Yes. He never told you? No. But I always helped. Sorry. (CRYING) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) I wish he would have told me about her. Us. Do you? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) He found you. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (KEYPAD CLACKING) JAKE: She's asleep. I don't want Yang to be on display in the museum. Neither do I. But... We should let them study his memories. -Do you think so? -Yes, his existence mattered. And not just to us. Yeah. (JAKE SIGHS) Gege. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) (IN ENGLISH) Daddy. Hey, what are you doing up? MIKA: What are you doing? You want some water? Want to sit beside me? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (JAKE EXHALES DEEPLY) Can't sleep. Me neither. Don't want to say bye to gege. Me neither. MIKA: (SINGING) I want to be I want to be I want to be just like a melody Just like a simple sound Like a harmony (SOFT INDIE MUSIC PLAYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DISTANT CHATTER) (ENGINE HUMS) (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) (METALLIC CHIMING) (MUFFLED THUNDER RUMBLING) (WATER GURGLING) (TICKING) (DISTANT SINGING) (BIRD CALLING) (METALLIC CHIMING)
