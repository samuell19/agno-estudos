Hello? Hello? Is this Mr. Luís Rovisco? - Speaking. - I’m calling from AutoLima. Sorry I’m late, I’m on my way out. On your way out? Don't worry. Take your time. I’m sorry. We just finished the previous job, we got behind. Don’t worry, I mean it. I’ve got all the time in the world. Okay, I hear you. Sorry about that. Thanks. No problem, see you soon. Do you mind if I smoke? As long as you don’t burn my trousers. What about my car? It’ll be ready tomorrow night. How’s it going, Mr. Rovisco? All good. - New wheels, huh? - I won it in a contest. - Which one? - The one in the cereal box. I collected the coupons and finished the sentence: “The best thing about Agadir Club Med..." "... is going and not coming back!” - And that got you a car? - It sure did. And a weekend at the resort. I might go there later this year. Right. They don’t make these anymore. Too bad, they last forever. But they don’t have the inputs we need. Tell you what, we’ll replace the old cameras with a new 12 camera system and put some new monitors here. Won’t this be crammed full of televisions? No, my friend, it’s just three. The image keeps skipping but everything is recorded. The camera back in the warehouse will turn on only when the door opens. - How does that sound? - Good. Great. I’ll send Fábio over, Wednesday or Thursday. - Is that okay? - Later is also fine. I’ll walk you out. How about a sensor on the road? So water would only come out whenever a car was passing by. We’ll see about that. - Hello. - Hi. Have a safe trip. Thank you. Hello Napoleão… How are you doing? MAIGRET AND THE SATURDAY CALLER Model B22, exactly. No, you see, that other one is wrong. We sent the form over on March 19th. Fábio, come over here. This again. How hard can it be? Mr. Luís has been quite distracted lately, that’s true... Joana, you always look prettier on Mondays. That’s because you forget about me on weekends. I messed up the invoice for the alarms, didn’t I? Well, these things happen, boys. They happen to the best of us. Nothing happens to the worst. Sure, these things happen. But it also happens that to accept the new invoice they’ll have to get permission from this and other so there's no money this month. So thank the heavens and me, it also happens that… - The elevator payment... - Which was due last month... - ... is coming in this month. - It already has. And that being the case, there’s more than rotten fruit in our harvest. - How was the weekend? - It was good. I went karting with some friends. There were a few network glitches but then I ran the detector and the problems have been flagged. It was because three of them were… kind of… poorly set up. The scanners were configured by Friday, and I’m supposed to go there this week to finish the job. I’m going there today to install the three missing RFIDs. What about training? You know talking… is not really my thing. But I manage okay. Sometimes clients can be a bit… annoying, I mean, not annoying, but kind of picky. They ask a lot of questions... That's okay, Fábio. This Wednesday you'll go to Fátima to handle Galhardo’s cameras. Actually he’s called to ask for an extra sensor. Replacing the clocking terminals in the Loures cafeteria. This is for Teixeira. Does it also include training? They bought it all by the book. Including maintenance. - But they’re nice people. - Is Saraiva still there? - Wasn’t his name Noronha? - Right, Noronha Saraiva. Peter calls him Mr. Carrot. Did he say anything? Not that I know of… nothing so far. I’d forgotten all about this... Some people in Olhão want seven barrier gates for a camping ground. Who needs seven gates on a camping ground? They want me to go over there to "assess, advise and budget”. If it’s gates I can go there. Or Fábio can. The hotel in Alvor keeps asking us to fix the motion sensors. - We could take care of both. - Hotel in Alvor? - That’s it. I’m too old to sleep in a tent. - I'm not sure you can work with the new sensors. I’ll go. You don’t know how to speak to those people. - Luís... - Algarveans and hound dogs... ... first you raise them, then you kill them. So it goes... The road goes by So it goes... The day goes by It goes by It all goes by. Alcácer goes by Aljustrel Almodôvar It all goes by The cold goes by The rain goes by It all goes by So it goes This wind goes by It all goes by, and what remains? In the countryside There are little yellow flowers On the pastures There are shepherds and cows In the air, flying by The pretty swallows This wind goes by It all goes by, and what remains? Hello, you’ve reached Peter Vale. Try again, it can’t be that bad. On the road There's a line I follow strictly A car overtakes me Neglecting to use the blinker This wind goes by, it all goes by… Hello, Mr. Teixeira. Hi. I’m calling to give you the code to the hotel terminals. Shoot. 7885363. Goodbye, Mr. Teixeira. - That’s a deal, then? - Sure, all good. I used to have a cage here full of parrots. One of them was Carla. - Ok... - They made me take them away. - Does this make you feel safer? - Sure it does. Some camping grounds around here… - What? Thieving? - They came around, because of the foreigners. - We’ll put one up here, with lights.. - Exactly, that's right. It’s a deal, then. Take care. How senseless are God’s lambs. How senseless. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Oh… Sorry. - That's ok. Thank you. Hi there, good morning! Carlos Antunes, the manager at your service. Luís Rovisco, SegurVale, Integrated Systems of Access Control. I’m sure you expected to meet my colleague Paulo Rodrigo. He honored us with his service, but everything comes to an end, he retired three months ago. - There you go. - Change is good, Mr. Rovisco. I learned a lot from him, but here at the Almadrava we’d love to take this opportunity to update certain procedures in the hotel management. Enhance our ratings. You know, Mr. Luís... Can I call you Luís? Our client influx is in constant transformation and nowadays being ready to adjust to the challenges the market presents to us is a major asset. - Overbooking. - Sometimes it happens! But it doesn’t at all define our policy. - What’s wrong with the sensors, then? - We’ve been detecting a few malfunctions. - Maybe they should be retiring too, right? - Maybe. You’ll be the judge of that. Our business model values the specific skill sets in the various areas within our activity. Mr. Luís, I see suppliers as partners. This way, this way. Our "all inclusive" philosophy doesn't just apply to our relationship with the clients. This way. These doors lock the security perimeter of the surrounding area where the pool plumbing goes through. And in terms of control? Inspections happen more often, and they’re stricter than ever. I’m sure you’re aware that security services have developed a lot, fortunately! I’m a strong advocate for inspection by all competent authorities. Our hotel fully cooperates with all initiatives towards greater efficiency and anticipation in the guidelines, allowing for the necessary adaptation and flexibility. Well, it's a challenging business. Very challenging, indeed. What do you think, Mr. Rovisco? They’re old! Duck crap! Of course. Hello. What? Nothing. Just checking in. Everything's great. We value specific skills, here at corporation. Goodbye! Hey there! Hey you, lazy bones! Coo coo ca choo! Come and see this damsel, trapped down here for years and centuries!… First used, then abused, switched, broken to bits and at last forsaken! All cut to pieces... Come on! Anybody home? Wake up! You got locked in. So I did. I didn’t follow the standard procedure, this is what I got. You’re in charge of surveillance too? No, those have been broken for months. But it wasn’t hard to find you after all that noise. - Promise not to tell anyone about this? - Don't worry about it. Luís Rovisco. No, no... This gentleman got locked in here… and I just… - Mrs. Lucinda... - Sousa. ... surely knows that things aren’t always what they seem. Oh, I’m racing by, I’m racing by I’m racing all the way No one can stop the beast inside me My tailpipe is growling Full speed ahead, I’m zooming by, zooming by And trust me You don’t want to stand in my way My tailpipe is growling Full speed ahead Until I burst, until I burst Oh, I’m going to explode I feel the fire rising A volcano inside My tailpipe is growling Full speed ahead Whatever comes, whatever comes What will be will be The roaring of this engine It will never die My tailpipe is growling I know sometimes Sometimes it’s weakness And I play tough Against my very nature My sensitive nature So kind So soft! Oh, if she wants me to slow down My tailpipe will cry... Oh, if she wants me to slow down My tailpipe will cry... If you’d seen what I saw… Now what? You can sleep here tonight. But not tomorrow. It’ll be alright, dad, you’ll see. Ana's been a nervous wreck so we thought it was better for a while. To see how it goes... I think it's going to be fine. I hope so. I hope you live happily ever after, and have beautiful blond children. Sometimes you need distance to find out. And Miguel? What are you telling him? You’re working and you'll be home tomorrow. You'll be home the next day, or the next? Do you think he won’t get it? If you’re going to leave, just leave. This new Acess Pass works at 320 millihertz, right? No. 400. Okay. And does it connect to the central server? - Of course, Luís, it’s 2018. - Is that so? Then how can I integrate it and create user lists? To integrate you use SV385. You create control areas for the lists. It's not going to end well. The interface needs to be perfectly set up. And it will be perfectly set up. Beyond perfection. Luís, you couldn’t even activate the cards. Duck crap! In 37 years I forgot a code for the first time! - It never happened to you? - That’s not the issue. It’s just that Fábio might get it done faster... And he’d also sell them 15 extra cameras? Of course. "Mr. Luís, Mr. Teixeira." "I’ve sold 15 cameras to the Almadrava Hotel!" "I mean, I didn’t really sell them, they asked for them." "I mean, I helped a little..." I’m the seller here! Hey! - Didn’t you go to work today? - I did, but I left early. Your parents are at the tenants’ meeting. Today I got a yellow card, but it was very unfair. That happens, sometimes… Did you ever get a yellow card? Oh… so many. What about red cards? Don’t you have homework? Miguelinho Please, milord The catalog on the dashboard This one? If you please I’ll answer all the questions in your quiz You’ll see how hard I’ve studied the lesson If that’s how you want to play it Let’s see how well you do Grandpa dear Won’t you tell me How many retractile gates do I see? - In which series? - "Privê" That’s four options, if you count "guichet" You’ve won fifty points But you want to be the champion - You’ll have to get every single one right - Let’s get on with it, then - Who knows it all? - Grandpa knows! He can’t miss! - I’m going to get it right, get it right - Otherwise you’ll flunk I know, and I’m going to ace the test. I don’t want to put up with those tedious guys They’ll stop at nothing to mess with my dreams Grandpa knows Yes, I do - Grandpa knows - I do, very well - Grandpa knows - Oui oui, my Michelle... - Aren’t tenants’ meetings later at night? - Sometimes. You be good now, and help your parents… - … set the table! - Set the table! Hello? Seven gates for a camping site? I'm sure we need at least seven more. Peter! I can’t believe my ears! So, how’s my friend doing? I hear he came south for a taste of the sun… You dog! What about you? Better than you. It’s not difficult. - How’s business? - Everything paid on time, as always. - And that leg of yours? - Eh. Eat some bananas, why don’t you? They make your tendons brand new. That’s what I do after playing golf. In fact, that’s exactly what I was calling about... Get that hotel business over with, and come play a few holes with me. - I can still teach you a thing or two... - Impossible. I have to replace these access terminals... Terminals? It's a bore! Peter, we need to talk... I was thinking next year... Another day, my friend, another day. Time flies. Damn you, Peter Vale. Good morning! How are you doing, my friend? TechnoBoss, Mr. Antunes. TechnoBoss! Three integrated paths, assuring the best circulation and data handling available. Access terminals, surveillance cameras and safe deposit box system, reporting back to your computer through an app developed exclusively by SegurVale. Access via RFID cards, cameras that eliminate empty data, and an option to expand up to 200 users. Everything certified and guaranteed through our constant improvement management system. I’m sure your hotel is also run to meet the very same standards of maximum quality and full control. Of course, Mr. Rovisco. Of course. Can I help you? No. Hello… - Luís, you have to go to Portimão. - I don’t have to go anywhere. The dead man in the nursing home is dying. The Englishman keeps calling. Damn. Can’t Fábio go there? Fábio is in Fátima, and you’re just around the corner. And the nursing home pays for maintenance. Just my luck... Get it done, please, will you? Let me know if you need anything. He called. Really? He wanted to play golf. You see? It doesn't sound at all! Peter would never approve of this! I mean, you've been lying there on the floor now for ten minutes and no alarm, nothing! If this happens for real how will I know if these good people need my help, huh? I tell you, this "dead man system" is bloody rubbish! Take it easy my friend. Take it easy. There's no need to worry. It still is the best system so far, that I can guarantee you. Christ! Look. It can be all sort of things: batteries of the sensors down there, poor connectivity with the central alarm, an informatic bug... God knows! God knows?! Is that it?! I didn't say it was it. Give me a week and everything will be alright. A week? A week?! A week! Now what Little goldfish, little goldfish I’m running in circles And I can’t catch you Now my dear boss Your dear little boss Now what, that damned Englishman Led me on a detour That won’t do, boss That won't do, boss Now what Are you going to make me pull over? Now what Go ahead and check if I’m drunk Now what Don’t you have better things to do? - Are you going to lock me up? - That won’t do, boss That won’t do, boss All the better. First you raise them, then you kill them. Now what Little goldfish, little goldfish I’m running in circles And I can’t catch you Now what My dear boss, your dear boss Oh yeah The damned Englishman led me on a detour All sorts of things That go beep Or don't go beep And here I am Sweating my ass off You know dryness all too well You know how it feels to sweat Every drop out of your skin Is just like a drop of rain That waters and colors the grapes And makes your thirst go away You’re nothing but a chicken She’s waiting and you do nothing You just stand there, unbelieving Trapped inside your own head And you know how it goes It’s now or never more That won’t do, boss. I’m nothing but a chicken If I don’t find out when you get off work… WISHING WELL Man, it's fuzzy again. It sounded better yesterday. I need it a little tighter. More high end on the bass. Ruben! Check mine out now. That's more like it. - Kind... - More high end! More high end? - Is that ok? - Almost. We're getting there. - Whisky, please. - Now what?! - Can’t I sit and have a drink? - Now what? - Can’t I just sit down and think? - Now what? Soon I’ll be lying in a nursing home... You are not eating boiled fish - Now what? - Seeing Miguel on Sundays - Now what? - Playing bingo with the old ladies That won’t do, boss Life goes by, it all goes by, and what remains? You’ve got to hold on to the fire within - C’mon, stop your whining - That won’t do, boss, no way You are far from being done rocking There are servers and gates to install - I want to hear your tailpipe growling - That won’t do, boss Your song is really very pretty But I don’t have that fire in me - I used to have it, now I don’t. - That won't do, boss I was wanted and loved as a young man If I was your age she’d be kissing me by now - My glory days are long gone - C’mon boss, that won’t do Come on, you’re a very classy dude Your brand of elegance never gets old - You're a volcano, running hot with charm - That won’t do, boss, no way You’re intuitive Wise, perceptive Sweet, kind Witty Natural, so fine - You're intuitive, wise, perceptive - Goldfish, little goldfish Goldfish, little goldfish My dear boss, your dear little boss If I were a woman, I would make you mine You would see You’re amazing You have a gift, so divine! - Now what? - I'm too old to keep up with you - Because of time, time, time. - Now what? - A voice went silent inside. - That won't do, boss! - To hell with me, to hell with me! - Now what! - To hell with me, to hell with me! - Now what! - To hell with me, to hell with me! - That won't do boss! To hell with me! Now what? Yes, Mr. Antunes? Mr. Antunes? I'm coming, Mr. Antunes. Mr. Antunes is out for tea. Come on, will you? Someone has to approve my work. It looks fine to me. Congratulations. You haven’t seen anything yet. I’ve seen too much. Well, I’ve seen too little all these years. When did you move here? So, just because he found me again, Mr. Luís thinks he is entitled to ask about my life? Mr. Luís never stopped trying to find you. Well, thirty years ago Mr. Luís never stopped trying to hide me... Don’t you remember? I haven’t handed out the access cards yet... You’re still a kid. Go open the door for the boy. Napoleãaaaao!! Are you alright? Yes, don’t worry. I was passing by and I heard screaming, I was worried to death. It was just a nightmare, it’s all over now. Thanks for your kindness. Sleep tight, Mr. Luís. Thank you, you’re an angel. I use to have a cage full of parrots here, you know. I even had one called Carla. I don’t have them anymore, ‘though. They made me take them away. Anyway, thanks for coming by and cleaning up this mess. - It’s much appreciated. - You’re welcome, it's my job. Have a good day. See you soon, my friend. - Who assures the installation? - Technoboss, Technoboss - Always makes a big sensation? - Technoboss, Technoboss Who can rise up the dead man? When the crap has hit the fan? Who just kills at marketing? Who fixes what’s not working? Who keeps it all running smooth? And who sells behind my back? Who won’t go the extra mile? ‘cause he’s about to retire? Can you believe this, pal? Napoleão. Is all Luís can say seeing his cat, cold and motionless, on the living room floor. Hello? Napoleão died. I don’t get it. He was fine, just yesterday. Really happy I was home again. What are you supposed to do when a cat dies? Duck crap! It was your cat too. Don’t be silly, Luís. I can’t even remember his face. Take him to the vet. But he’s dead, Clara. I know. I got it. But they’ll know what to do there. You think so? I do. I’m sure many have died there. Pet him for me. Nothing is eternal like the pain I feel It’s been here since before I was born An echo of static in this void An infinite cry Uh oh What’s the meaning, uh oh? My little kitten, uh oh? Oh this sad pain Uh oh That will silence me This is Júlio. He’ll keep you good company. How are you, dad? It looks like he has feathers. Napoleão would eat him for breakfast. It was the damnedest thing. He was in such high spirits yesterday. What did the vet say? Nothing. He’d have to open him up to find out. It wasn’t worth the trouble. Right. With Napoleão gone you could have that chair fixed. What’s the point? That armchair isn’t proper anymore. Proper for whom? I don’t know… Aunt Rosa is coming over in two days. Damn. I’d forgotten about that. You’re bringing Ana? Yes you are. I’m stupid. I’m stupid. I’m stupid. Right. Now it's okay up to number 14. - And this if for the new equipment, right? - Right, systems first and then alarms. Luís, the hotel in Alvor called again. Oh! I have to go there and fix the gate. The gate? What gate? They told me the vault doesn't close. Algarveans and hound dogs... I too have lived through travels and travails. Apparently, I spoke too soon. That thing went bananas soon as you left. It’s a delicate system, you know? Don’t I know it. That’s all I know, in fact. The truth is should be simpler. User-friendly it is not. There’s no fool like an old fool. How have you been storing things? It's a pain. We manage, don’t you worry. Do you want to give me a hand? No. I don’t and I can’t. I have guests to check in. In order to perform the repairs requested upon me, according to the procedures that certify SegurVale, Integrated Systems of Access Control, as a company committed to the highest standards of quality I’m going to have to ask you to present a full report of the sequence of malfunctions at this hotel’s security vault room. Being as the end of your shift is approaching, and to avoid any further delay in the repairs, so as not to disturb the hotel’s operation, I hereby propose an informal meeting, ninety minutes from now, in a restaurant in town. All expenses, of course, will be charged to SegurVale, Integrated Systems of Access Control. You’re crazy. Again, I must remind you that, without the information I’m asking for, I won't be able to perform maintenance as I am bound to with your establishment. As you’ve stated earlier, my working hours are indeed coming to an end. Let's be precise, if it's precision you're after. I shall be off the clock in seventeen minutes. I’ll wait in the lobby. You can meet me tomorrow at 3pm, in the manager’s office. I’ll report all relevant information regarding the process. I know sometimes Sometimes it’s weakness And I play tough Against my very nature My sensitive nature So kind So soft! I've got your number. MAIGRET AT THE GUESTHOUSE Good morning, sunshine. Hello, Mr. Luís, how are you doing? Happy to hear your voice. You’ll be even happier with the news I bring. Mr. Vale is in Seville, closing a very big deal with a supermarket chain. Of course he requires your presence to evaluate the contract. Olé. Mr. Luís? Mr. Luís? Tell Mr. Vale... Don’t tell him anything. Such a messy situation The fucking corporation The fucking corporation Such a messy situation Such a messy situation, The fucking corporation The fucking corporation Such a messy situation Mas que grande confusión La puta de la corporación! Of the days Luís spent in Seville, and the abysses he visited there, very little is known. The scarce information available becomes even less solid after my careful examination. Such attention to detail reflects the doubts and distress the Andalusian episode raised in me. Moral weakness sets in slowly, insidiously. Luís and Peter’s meetings in Seville become somewhat mythical and are landmarks in SegurVale’s shadier history, the part of history that can’t be backed up by invoices. According to Peter’s will, such meetings are never scheduled in predictable intervals. Besides excessive amounts of alcohol the only constant in these gatherings, as far as I know, are immature visits and raids to El Corte Inglés department stores, thus turned into an insane playground for two grown men. What they steal is always irrelevant, mostly locally sourced cured meats. This one looks tasty. Lomito Joselito, high degree of pure fat. - We’ll take it. - What a treat! The goal is to deactivate the store’s alarms and to leave before anyone notices. Peter distracts the security guard. - Excuse me, friend. - Can I help you, sir? Can you tell me where the restroom is? It’s an emergency. A major one. Meanwhile, Luís, pretending to tie his shoelaces and armed with a precision tool, sabotages the alarm. All sorts of things... ... that go beep or don’t go beep. The two men gather by the door, excitement in their eyes. - May the Macarena Virgin be with us! - Go!!! Run, buddy, run! It wasn’t the perfect rehearsal but it did make Luís recover his professional composure. - Peter, this is very poorly written. - Oh, come on! The omission of articles in section 12 is a serious matter. - They can screw us over. - C'mon man, he will eat it up. He can’t get those precios this side of the Pyrenees. Speaking of which, it must be way cooler than here. Drink up, hombre! Relax. It's just another day at the office. You should know that. Pussy. Next time we order you some tea and biscuits. Peter, we have a little problem. These prices are not the ones we agreed upon. Well... Who do you think you’re dealing with? Don Ramiro, with all due respect, those prices include the maintenance clauses that were missing in the previous version. And why are they here now? Look, Don Ramiro, the choice is yours, you either want them or you don’t. You want them. If you want my advice, you should keep them. They’ll buy you a lot of peace and quiet. It's true, Don Ramiro. Go for it, man. If he knew the jewels shining on Don Ramiro’s assistant’s neck were a gift from Peter Vale, Luís might have not been so eloquent. One way or another, they had closed the deal. And SegurVale - Integrated Systems of Access Control was now in charge of all security equipment in Don Ramiro’s supermarket chain. Another one bites the dust. Almost there. Look boy, with my eyes closed. Watch and learn! You’ve got to focus, muchacho! Just you wait ‘till I retire. I’m going to practice everyday. Oh yeah, right... Here we go again… Don’t get your hopes up. I need some fuel in my tank, boss. Okay, okay… Damn you, Peter Vale! Dance, you prick! Who's your daddy? Let's go! Jump Peter! Not easy man, not easy! All the ladies in the room, baby! That's my boy! Damn it. Where’s Lucinda? - Sorry? - Is Lucinda here? Mrs. Lucinda Sousa is not in. To whom am I speaking? Luís Rovisco. I’m with SegurVale... It’s about the vault. Your partner left earlier this morning. My partner? Mr. Ricardo Teixeira. The vault is now working properly. Luís’s face, which had been growing ever more pale, turns to ice. Through that thin and transparent ice, we can see a heavy and painful sadness. Our man realizes that the trip to Seville was only a diversion orchestrated by Peter. To himself, deeply hurt, he says: Damn you, Peter Vale. Tollbooth girl where’d you go? I was passing through But I didn’t see you And the machine That takes your place Says: "Please try again" I’m travelling on To try and find Somewhere that’s good for me Somewhere I can just be Without the machine That takes my place And tells me to Try again Tollbooth girl If somewhere I find a better world Where they know what we’re worth I’ll promise I’ll come back for you And we’ll start all over again That's my boy! Would you like to go for some shrimps and milkshake? You bet, Peter, you bet! How senseless. Luís… I’m sorry for disturbing you, can I… ask you a question? Don’t take this the wrong way. I mean, you don’t even have to answer. - I’m just asking because… - Shoot! What are you doing over there? I’m working. Teixeira and I switched places. Teixeira is inside, in my office. I mean, it’s his office now. Go see for yourself. Mr. Teixeira is on vacation, Fábio. Oh! Speaking of vacation, the Almadrava called again. They want you to go there and fix… I too have lived through travels and travails. However, we couldn’t be more different. Whereas I sigh in resignation, Luís curses it, offended. Fuck. And next, he gladly accepts his fortune, while I curse it with all I have. Man’s contradictory nature is a commonly accepted fact of life. Very well, but what is it to me? Hello, Mr. Rovisco, how are you? I’m fine. And so is the gate. So it is. But this one has always been, the one on the entrance is the problem. In that case... I have nothing to do with it! Mr. Rovisco! Just a moment, Mr. Rovisco. No, wait. There. That’s it. Now, this won’t be that hard. Feel better. For the first few days, you should always use the crutches. I could say “that’s life”. But no, it’s just A small piece of it. Front desk, hello? What. I want room service. - I see. And what is your request? - A special sandwich. Is there an extra ingredient you are after? Yes. - Pickled cucumbers. - Okay... - Manchego cheese... - Okay... - Arugula... - Okay. - Cherry tomatoes... - Sure, why not. Boiled egg, turkey breast... - And Dijon mustard. - Right away. Come on in. Room service!! Why are you looking at me like that? Isn't this what you ordered? Cornichons and manchego? Your stomach will be upset. It’s my head that’s upset. Tell me something new. At least you got yourself a nice room. Nice view! What are you doing here? Isn’t it obvious? I came over to feed you. Did I ever leave you without a little treat? You’re something else... Those things look ancient. - They’ll do just fine. - Maybe. If you behave you won't need them very long. Get well and come play golf with me. Early retirement, my friend! Isn't that what you wanted? I never left a job unfinished it’s not going to happen now. Oh, the gate! My friend, I’ll send for Teixeira right away. If you call him back here again, I’ll break your nose! Made in Rovisco pride. How could I have forgotten? What’s keeping you here? - Just let me finish my things. - Okay, okay... Even if I didn’t let you... I hope you know what you're doing. The offer still stands. But you don’t. Well, I've got some clients to please. Someone has to do the dirty job. Eat some bananas, eat some bananas! Come in! There’s the sandwich. You can take it. This came for you. - Who sent it? - How should I know? It was at the front desk when I came in. They didn’t leave a name. Sure you don’t want this? It would do you good... Go, and take that thing away from here. No wonder you have nightmares... Hello? Hi, dad. It’s Jorge. What. What? - Aunt Rosa isn't coming for dinner after all. - All the better. - When are you coming back? - Whenever I please. Hello! Hello, I’m calling from the front desk. Oh... Go ahead. The sandwich you ordered this afternoon, wasn’t it delivered? It sure was. And very quickly too. Well... In that case... Wasn’t it to your liking? I don’t know. How can you not know? I could not eat it. Was there something wrong with the sandwich? No... In that case, I bid you good night. Lucinda... What. Won’t you come upstairs? I work at the front desk. I don’t do room service. Lucinda, I can’t walk. Sorry. I’m not a nurse either. Well, as long as you won’t come upstairs, I won’t eat. Is that what this is, a hunger strike? Well, aren’t you creative... It won’t last a day. It’ll last as long as it takes. Nothing. Nothing. A gift from Mr. Vale. Could I ask you for a favor? Sure, go ahead. Will you take this to the front desk? By the way... You wouldn’t, by any chance... Happen to have some food? If I can’t be of any help to you now it’s not because I don’t want to or because of any resentment. I know what your spirit can accomplish and I’m even more aware that like everything else, it’s not constant. The tiniest of all the fig parrot gorges on fruit bigger than its head. The general rule for the males here is to be as colourful as needs be to attract a mate, without becoming a neon lure to predators. The king parrot is brash. There was an old woman who had a cat She kept him under her bed The cat would meow And the woman would say I’m alone, I’m alone I’m lonely as can be I’m alone There was an old woman who had a dog She kept him under her bed The cat would meow The dog would bark And the woman would say I’m alone, I’m alone I’m lonely as can be I’m alone There was an old woman who had a rooster She kept him under her bed The cat would meow The dog would bark The rooster would sing And the woman would say May you all rot down in hell For I can’t stand you anymore! MAIGRET AND THE CROSSROADS The little ant has no liver. She put her liver in her hips. How beautiful is her love. I always put the cart Before the horse I jump in And ask questions later I must have been born From Beelzebub’s horn No one can stop me Because I am A dog with a bone You have nothing to fear. I’ve got a thousand years Under my skin My poison is sweet My kiss is cruel I’m going to go wild On the danger zone No one can stop me Because I am A dog with a bone I make my own bed And the sheets are always dirty I’ve got cowboys and Indians under my belt Age is just a number Well, I just want to be naked No one can stop me Because I am A dog with a bone I’ve got a past Call it good or bad But there are roads To travel ahead And so I push on Like the crook I’ve become No one can stop me Because I am A dog with a bone! Hello! Is this Mr. Luís Rovisco, certified business representative with SegurVale, Integrated Systems of Access Control? Speaking. This is Lucinda Sousa. If you would be so kind as to meet me in thirty minutes in the nighttime leisure establishment by the marina so I can present a detailed and comprehensive report on the sequence of anomalies.

I had to park three cars outside already, and one of them was a Jaguar. To think something could have happened to it. Did you try the card Mr. Antunes gave you? I did, I tried every single card. - Can we park? - In a moment, sir. In a moment. All due respect, shouldn't we call Mr. Teixeira? Teixeira is off on vacation. Oh... So that’s why… So that’s why what? Nothing, Mr. Rovisco, nevermind. Oh my... Can we help? Such a bore. - Try with the other hand! - In a moment, sir. In a moment. Here, try these. You left them in your other coat.
