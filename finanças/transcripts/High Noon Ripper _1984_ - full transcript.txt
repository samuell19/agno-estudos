Focus on the eyes I told you zoom in Get a lower angle! Take a side profile of the face! Shut up! This is my business. What are you doing?! You're annoying me. Why don't you develop the film by yourself? You were supposed to print them! I got tired of it. That's a breach of contract! So fire me. I don't need this. What?! Hey, where are you going?! So you think you're a blue turtle, then. Don't you have to go to work? I Will. You got money? That's how I got this room. But I'm having a hard time right now. It was better just being the other woman. I had no problems before I met you. What a pity. I'll be rich before I turn 30. Only one year left... I still have a year. Peace! I'm tired of that pose! How are they? Great! You two are good at crime scene photography. But he never listens to me. Don't fight with him, okay? Try talking to him more. Your work could save our magazine! People love gory photos. I don't think so... Maybe you don't understand because you women bleed every month! Well, you should keep in contact with him. Alright. Oh hey, I'm pretty busy. Do you think you could attend this with Makiko? - With Makiko? - Tell her I'm sorry. - No problem. - Thank you. See you. I liked that movie. It wasn't my cup of tea... Oh, so it was his choice. You're a cute couple. I don't know. Why don't we go for a drink? I have a bit of a headache, so should probably head home. - I see. - Sorry. These are very rare photos! I love this shutter speed. Don't be stubborn! Come on, I just want to talk a little. Thanks! Give me a second! I'm ready. 2,0,9... 3, 8, 8, 0... Shun Tatsukawa. See you soon. Thanks! This is Kaji, the one who just called. Come in. There's no one else here. That's a nice telescope. Staring at your neighbor's ass? It gets boring just looking at the stars. I guess so. As I told you on the phone, I'm a photographer. I'm interested in your photos. Where'd you take them? Why do you want to know? I just thought it might be the exact moment of the murder. I have a friend, her name is Handy. For 1,000 yen, she'll jerk you off. That's why they call her Handy. But if I give her 10.000 yen, she becomes Pussy. Understand? Are you kidding me? 1/4000 of a second... That shutter speed will be the theme of the next photo club project. And the culture club will focus on background music. I talked too much last time. I wasn't feeling too well. I envy that you women can bring up that excuse a few days every month. I'm serious when I say you should think more while working with freelancers. We all liked your photos. We're currently writing an article called Who is the Ripper? Why not offer a reward? We're originally a literary magazine. We don't want a sleazy reputation. You should do whatever it takes to survive. Oh, right. You're a voyeur. You wouldn't understand. I think you're pure at head even if you pretend to be a badass. And you try to be pig-headed. So you want to team up with me? I hope your writing is on par with my photos. Oh well, guess we'll find out. I don't know about this part... It should be more abstract. But the first part feels very real. It's not very effective. What do you think? I think that's fine. - Hello. - Yes. This is Eatsukawa. I can't reach my phone right now At the end of this recording, please count 1, 2 and 3. You may then leave a message. If you're enjoying the music, you may enjoy it free of charge. You're welcome. My name is Noriko Okumura. I have a question regarding your photos. My number is 372-1411. I'm available anytime after 8 p. m. Late calls are fine too. Please get back to when you can. Thank you. Did you reach the photographer? I left him a message yesterday but he still hasn't called back. Why do you like this one? Call it intuition. I see a big story here. You should focus on the Ripper. Readers gave good feedback on our Ripper article. The sales department is busy for once! Is the pilot for the commercial done? Yeah. Can you hand me the cutter? Hey, that's dangerous! - Aren't you going to use it? - Yeah, but still... I'm going for some beef soba. You have unique tastes. This desk is kind of cold... Let's put in some overtime. I can't reach my phone right now. At the end of this recording, please count 1, 2 and 3. You may then leave a message. I brought a present for you! When did you get here? Here, Happy Birthday! But it's a lonely one, huh? You think you're a golden snake then. Why is no one ever here? Where are your parents? You here to ask about my photos again? Of course. One day, my father found himself another woman. Soon after, my mother found herself another man. I don't care either way, so long as they send me money. - Yeah? - Where were you? I've been calling! - Bitch, don't bother me! - Makiko got stabbed! - Who? - Makiko! Go and take pictures! How did you take them? I just snuck past the cops. He cut open most of her belly. He's a freak. We don't want to call him that just yet. I think you should. Vague articles leave them wanting more. Is that how it works... Noriko wrote this script for our commercial pilot. Please take this copy and watch it. I want you to shoot the poster. Sure. Where is my writer, by the way? The police are interviewing her. She received a threatening phone call. That's awful. Who are you? 300 yen. What do you want? I take girls pictures for a fee around town on the weekends. It's the same price as a coffee. Won't you buy it? Not interested. I see. Then... How about this one? You want me to buy the negative. You want to sleep with me? Not a chance in hell, you little shit! How about you got back to learning your ABCs, kiddo? It was pretty funny, though. Try to be more romantic next time. Can you help me? With what? I told you about that photographer kid. You did? I want you to follow him. Why? I need to know more about him. Do you think you could ever cut? Cut what? A person. I don't know... Hey! I want to know more. - About me? - Yeah. Not knowing is better. I'm nosy. That's why I became a photographer. No! Stop it! No! No! No! No! Stop it! What's your problem? - I can't... - What? I was once raped by three men. - That's why... - You're scared of men? - I wasn't one of the guys who raped you. - Screw you! No matter what you say... You'll never understand how I feel. Do all men scare you? They beat me to within an inch of my life. I was hospitalized for three weeks. How could you ever understand how I feel? Hello, this is Okumura. I can't reach my phone right now Please leave your message after the beep. Thank you for calling. It been a while since you first came here for counseling... I didn't know that this physical treatment scared you. Hey, it's Kajii! The kid is the Ripper! Got it. Go get a picture! Where is he? Where is the knife? I don't have a knife. Those two pictures in the magazines... My rape? A lie. Hospitalized for three weeks? Another lie. Being scared of men? The biggest lie! I'm a woman and yet I'm not a woman. I have neither penis nor vagina. Seriously? Yes, I was born deformed. However... Once a month I'm irritable, though I don't have a period. I was seeing a psychiatrist. But... The first picture... We did it together. This is the place where we killed her. I met her while walking in this ven/ park. I had the sudden urge to tell someone my secret. But that woman just looked at me funny and laughed! I can still hear her laugh. I was following my own shadow When I killed Makiko, that guy took my picture. Happy Birthday, she said! What should I be happy about? - Did you also kill Miki? - Not a good one. - Did you?! - She followed him. But when I heard about it at the office, something was different. You killed her to get the pictures, even though she was still alive. What are you talking about? Do you know where this picture was taken? From right over there. KODAMA 256 departed from Tokyo at 14:16. He took my picture by accident. 1/4000. Can you love me as a woman even if I'm not a woman? You're insane. Not at all. I'm giving you the chance to take a once-in-a-lifetime photo. Get your camera. Look through the viewfinder. Hello, do you know Parallax magazine? I'm the editor and he's my assistant. - Can we interview you for the magazine? - Wow, sure! How exciting! Then let us take your photo first. Can you come with us? Don't be nervous. Relax! Good! Good! And smile! Just like that! You're very cute! Okay, one more!
