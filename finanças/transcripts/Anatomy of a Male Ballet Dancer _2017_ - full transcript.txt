[MARCELO] It's Marcelo with one L and Gomes with an S. Are you ready? - [MAN] For what? - I'm ready. I'm gonna fix my name here cause... It's spelled wrong. It's with an S. You may call me Marchelo, I'm fine with that. It's okay. I've been called Marchelo for years. And so, I'm used to it. Um... but it's... Gomes? Then I have a little bit of a problem with that. Well, really, it's Marcelo Gome-sch. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [MARCELO] More than anything I love to partner a ballerina on stage. When you're partnering a ballerina, you have to be in total control but you also have to let her shine. I am not there for myself. I am there for her. You have to make sure that you're breathing with your ballerina. It's being connected in that moment. That's why I have such good relationships with so many ballerinas because I do enjoy sharing that moment with them. [VERONIKA PART] I love to dance with Marcelo. It's not so many great guys who can really dance and act and partner ballerinas. I'm a big and tall dancer. The high standard of Marcelo's partnering is when you don't feel how much your weight is. [SLOW CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [MARCELO] I'm guesting the Kremlin ballet production of Swan Lake. Usually, I wear my costume but for these shows in Athens, I've had to borrow from friends to see what the best option is. [VERONIKA SIGHS] It's okay. Here, a bit right. Yeah, I mean, I feel a little bit like that and look. [VERONIKA] Short? Like baby gap. Like, I'm trying to fit into my childhood clothes. Well, but for second act you have to be in black. [VERONIKA] Well, black swan. It's okay. It's gold. Well, if you feel more comfortable in this, definitely... Well, I don't wanna look like a peasant in the middle of all the guys. Cause they all have like really nice shirts. [VERONIKA] Yeah, it's too simple. Yeah, it's too simple. [VERONIKA] Yeah, okay, we have to look from a distance. Oh, okay. That's too bad. Go there. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] No, it's good. [MARCELO] Really? [VERONIKA] Yeah. [MARCELO] Okay. I think the thing that is unique to Marcelo is that he does everything well. [KEVIN MCKENZIE] He is Mr. Versatile. [CROWD CLAPPING] He has a remarkable ability to cross genres, and characters and type of dance from Kylian to Petipa [VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING] [ALEXEI] It's never about himself, It's always about his partner or the choreography or the role. He is just an example of how a ballet dancer should behave, should act, should be in a studio and should be on stage. [CELLO MUSIC PLAYING] [CLINTON LUCKETT] The one dancer to see an extraordinarily gifted partner, an amazing actor, and also, an extremely fine technician. To have all three of those qualities in one dancer is very, very unusual. [MARCELO] I've watched tapes of Rudolf Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Fernando Bujones and Julio Bocca. Those are all guys who have really influenced me when I was in Brazil. Somehow, my teacher had tapes of them. After ballet class, we'd go to her house and watch them. I needed to have those guys to watch, in order for me to... ...be inspired about my own career. I can't imagine not having them, you know. [CROWD MURMURING] [MARCELO] I think when you are young you dream of doing certain roles. You know, Siegfried in Swan Lake, Basilio in Don Quixote, Albrecht in Giselle, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Solor in La Bayadere. Those are roles that you really feel like you want to tackle at one point in your life. The big classical roles have a deadline. You can't do these forever. The career is short. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC EASES DOWN] [FIDDLE PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [CROWD APPLAUDING] [WATER RUNNING] [WOMAN] Hello? [MARCELO] My mother, every time she can, she's here in New York visiting me. Anytime I can, I want to go to Manaus and spend time with her. Mm-hmm. Even though we don't speak every day, there's that immediate connection that we get when we talk on the phone or Skype. [SKYPE MESSAGE SOUND] Since my parents divorced, I've been a lot closer to my mother. I don't feel like there's still a father figure in my life. I think that my parents divorce was a lot for him to take. It could be just all to painful. He has wife now, another wife and a son... ...with her and... It's a drastic disconnection from being the greatest father... ...you know, to... ...to being Just Haroldo. My father hasn't really been up to New York to see me dance, probably, in ten years. I started making myself very depressed and miserable. If I was expecting for him to be in the audience. [MARCELO SNIFFLING] The approval from your family is something so special. [SNIFFING] I want him to see me here and for him to hug me and say, "Yes, you have made it. All that stuff we went through from the age of five years old, that you were able to play Romeo today." That would be the ultimate gift. [MARCELO] I joined American Ballet Theatre in 1997 when I was seventeen years old. ABT is such a big part of my life. [DOOR BUZZING] [CLINTON] He's one of the first that I have witnessed really, really grow up from a child to a full-grown adult with his own identity and make his own mark. [MARCELO] I see myself dancing as long as my body can take. I think there will be one point where it'll speak to me and say, does this not what you want to be doing anymore? Or it hurts too much? [MARCELO] Go up. Good girl. [CLINTON] Really high at the back of the knee. Ta, tee, easy... Now, really high at the back, yes. Now, get you up on your left hip. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLINTON] Left turn, left turn. Yes, two, three, four... Yee-yes! [MARCELO GIGGLING] That would be cool! [CLINTON] Most dancers feel, physically, at their highest peak, I would say, in their late twenties, maybe their first couple of years in the thirties. And usually around 32 to 34, you start to feel the body can't do everything that you're asking of it. [CLINTON] Left side, That's it. Left arm. Yes. [UPTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] Good. [MUSIC PICKS UP] [CLINTON] Marcelo is right in that golden moment where he has matured as an artist. And his body is still completely responsive and available to him. [MUSIC STOPS] [MARCELO EXHALES] [MARCELO] Um... I think... I'd like to do a third double tour there. [MARCELO] What do you think? [CLINTON] I'm an advocate of the third double tour just because nobody ever does it anymore. It's just a question of negotiating those years. Navigating them carefully. The norm for any ballet dancer, especially, male dancers, is forty is about the limit that the physique can take that kind of high impact. However, he has a very strong body and he has a very intelligent mind. He could beat the odds and go beyond. [MARCELO] Thank you, that's so nice of you. Daddy is working real hard. Sugar Loaf. Where? Sugar Loaf. Oh yeah. [MARCELO] This is first time I'm dancing in Rio in over ten years. It's a big homecoming. I'm dancing Don Quixote with a ballerina I've just met. [TRAFFIC NOISE] [MARCELO] My ankle woke up a little swollen this morning, so, I was worried. When I get on stage it feels okay. It's after, when I close off. [SPRAYING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MARCELO] The role of Basilio in Don Quixote is all about the pirouettes and all about the jumps. We've seen many Basilios do some really impressive tricks. So, when you don't give them all the tricks, some audience members may feel like they are not getting the full value of the role. The tricks get harder as you get older. [MUSIC STOPS] [CROWD CLAPPING] [EXCLAIMING IN PAIN] As soon as I get home I ice my ankle in an ice bucket. It's excruciating but it really helps. I can do what I can do with it. I know that there is something kind of funny about it. But... I didn't think I could do even one show and now, I've done three. I grew up with my uncle, Paulo, and his partner, Wulf. So, they're both my uncles. [WOMAN] Okay? [EXHALES IN PAIN] [EXHALES] [DALAL ACHCAR] He has a quality that is very rare. Very special. He dances like a prince and a gentleman. He really knows that a pas de deux is a pas de deux, it's a dance for two. He is very generous and he communicates as an artist. And this has no price. He looks to the eyes, he gives something, he receives and he builds from just a simple pas de deux, a great ballet. [MARCELO SIGHS] [CLICKING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD APPLAUDING] [UPTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [CROWD APPLAUDING] It's like, almost, your whole life flashes before you when you are bowing for a house that excited. You know, and you're just like, "Wow, I've just worked so hard to get here and this is why." It's the applause. The recognition. Especially here, especially at home. [CHURCH BELL RINGING] I was born in Manaus, Brazil. In the heart of the Amazon and I moved to Rio when I was five years old. For as long as I can remember, that was me. A young boy, no shoes, just my black trunks. And I would run all the way to Copacabana and jump right in the water. So, this is where it all started. At the Illumicube, which was at the end of my neighborhood. The streets at the end of my neighborhood. Going up to a favela. And in this studio my sister was taking gym class and I came to pick her up. And I ran right up there, and there was a musical theater class happening and I just jumped right in. In the middle of a bunch of girls, I told the teacher that I could do whatever they were doing. So, after two years of musical theater, Helena Lobato, she was an ex ballerina of the Theatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro. And she saw me in a performance that we had and she told me I needed to try ballet. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MARCELO] The fact that my family didn't blink twice that I didn't wanna go to gym class, that I didn't wanna play soccer, and I wanted to be, with my hand on the bar, doing plies, is very unusual. They could see, I think, it was my calling. Six months, when my brother was six months, she started raising him and then she saw my sister be born and then myself. She used to take me to ballet class every day. Yeah, yeah. [MARCELO] After school, I didn't even go home, and I would change and eat in the car on the way to ballet class. And she would be there. [CHUCKLES] Bringing my lunch. I didn't know anything about ballet. I was challenged. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [HAROLDO] I was called at the school to ask me if I need some therapy. A Brazilian wouldn't accept to leave his kid to dance. Dance is for girls. I said, "I don't need therapy." I know what I'm doing and he knows what he's doing. I'm just supporting him. [MARCELO] Being the only boy was a bit of a challenge. I definitely got bullied in school for dancing. Girls do ballet and boys do soccer, especially in Brazil. But I knew ballet class was where I needed to be. I didn't let all those voices from the young boys hurt me. Something about being in the studio, listening to music and dancing was everything. I was in heaven. [MARCELO GIGGLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [BOTH] Ooh. [MARCELO] My dad was an incredible influence in my life when I first started. I don't think I would've kept going when I was a teenager if it wasn't for my father. I promised him a lot of time to go to New York, I didn't go because of these personal reasons that I had. And he lost faith about me. When I say I'm going to New York, I'm gonna see you, he doesn't believe it. He is right. One day... Maybe, this year or next year, I will go to the Metropolitan to see Marcelo again. You know, it's crazy, it's like, all these feelings come back because when I was dropped off here at 13, I was with my mom and dad and I didn't speak any English, and it was really scary. It was like jumping into, like a dark abyss. Really. I remember driving down this road and uh... Yeah. Just praying that everything was gonna go okay. I think. From there on, I knew that I was saying goodbye to Marcelo. [BOTH LAUGHING] [MARCELO] It's good to see you. You look good. Thanks, the school looks great. [MARCELO GASPS] [MAN] I think you were thirteen. Yes. [MAN] You were half the size you are now. There is Robert and Philip. Here's your first white swan. Well, that's a good one there. [MARCELO] This is amazing. [GIGGLES] Already had that feeling. [MAN] There you go. The feeling was there. The technique. [WOMAN] All right, so... [MARCELO] There were only two before me. Now look how many people have graduated. [DOOR KNOCKING] [MARCELO] Wow. Yeah. Oh, my God. They have TVs? They have full on TVs. We did not, we were not allowed to have TVs. The arabesque is not gonna go up as high. Anymore. Is it because of these pants maybe? - [WOMAN] Oh yeah. - It needs a change. [LAUGHING] I was, sorta, like this. Little bit. Maybe I was trying to hold a balance. I was like that, no? I think so. [GIRL] What're you dancing tonight, Marcelo? Today I'm dancing [INDISTINCT]. - [GIRL] Oh, you are? With Sara? - Yeah. Real Merry Christmas. That's not beautiful. It's cactus... [LAUGHS] [WOMAN] Marcelo, there were other Brazilians when you were here? Or no? You were the first? There were girls that were Brazilians. But no boys. No boys. You were the first boy. Hey, sorry. [MARCELO] Is this your room? [BOY] Yeah. Oh, come in. No, no, no, Please, this is your room. Are you kidding? [WOMAN] Then we have to tell in English. That makes me feel great. [WOMAN] Yeah. The year I graduated, he was born. Yeah. [BOTH LAUGHING] [WOMAN] One, two three. Beautiful. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [WOMAN] One more, just in case. One, two, three. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MARCELO] My parents saw that I couldn't grow any further if I had stayed in Brazil. Technique-wise, culturally, seeing different ballets, seeing different dancers, seeing different art forms, that I got when I came to America. As much as it hurt them so badly, I think they knew, looking at this campus in Florida, that they were doing the right thing. [BALLET MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [OLIVIER] One of the best ambassador of the ballet in the world, Mr. Marcelo Gomes. [CROWD CLAPPING] Thank you, let's take class. [PIANO PLAYING] Fifth position, please. I didn't say you can relax. Lifting, shoulders down, chin up. Keep your position. No bar. Right. Remember everyone. This is very important. Why do I ask you to hold your position at the end of the exercise? Because if you can't do it at the end of every exercise, this going to happen on stage at the end of evaluation. Right? Thank you. You can relax, everyone. This is very important, guys. This is ballet. Nothing else. [MARCELO] Listen to him, he knows what he is talking about. It starts in this place. And it may not matter to you now, but it's incredible how many times I think, "Ah, Olivier used to say that to me all the time." And it's after the fact. And so, enjoy it now. Really do, okay? All right. [CROWD CLAPPING] Gordon Wright asked me to prepare Marcelo for Prix de Lausanne Then things change a little bit. You become a coach, you become a mentor. That means you don't help your student only technically but emotionally. Which is, maybe, the most important part when you go to a competition. Right away after a few classes, a lot of people came to see me, and they all said the same thing, his stage presence is unbelievable. When he's on stage, even at this young age, they say, "We cannot take our eyes off him." [MARCELO] I was extremely scared to go to Prix de Lausanne. I had never been exposed to dancers from the Royal Ballet, from Russia and I saw that they had incredible technique. So, I had to really step up my game. [CROWD CLAPPING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] That's the great thing about Prix de Lausanne, it's not the dancer that's ready right then and there, but the dancer that will give hope to the future of ballet. [CROWD CLAPPING] The whole price at the Prix de Lausanne did change my career because it allowed me to go to the Paris Opera ballet school. American Ballet Theatre was on tour in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. And I just happened to be there to take a little vacation in between United States and going to France. They were doing a... Bayadere, you know the ballets that need extra boys. So, I offered myself, my services as a super, as an extra on stage. [KEVIN] At that time I had an associate director, his name was David Richardson. By the time I arrived, he said, "You know, I've got a super here for this ballet who wants to take the class, the company class." I thought, oh great. Sure. [MARCELO] I was doing this petit allegro combination across the floor and Kevin looked at David, he was standing near the door, and he nodded his head. And I just remember thinking to myself, "Could I be offered a contract from American Ballet Theatre today?" And it was exactly what happened. Marcelo was very excited about this. I was too but before his vacation, he had won the Prix de Lausanne that gave him a chance to go to Paris. I knew that I had to join ABT. I knew that I had to go but I had this scholarship ready to go to Paris Opera Ballet. So, I had very wise parents at that moment that turned down the contract. And he said, "No, I appreciate it but I'm going to go to Paris Opera for my last year of training." I thought, "Wow, that's smart." [MARCELO] I experienced so many things at the Paris Opera ballet school. I not only grew as a dancer but I also grew as a man. They focused so much on my technique. They were very particular, had very strict teachers. Most of the time I didn't understand what they were saying because they were only speaking French. And so, I had to learn that very quickly to be able to communicate. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] It was important here, for me. Over all, an experience of a lifetime. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [CROWD CLAPPING] [PIANO PLAYING] [MARCELO] We're going to be learning a Nutcracker pas de deux by Alexei Ratmansky. It's probably one of the hardest pas de deux I've ever had to dance. There is a bit acting, a bit of lifting, partnering, a solo for the ladies and a little solo for the men. So, there is everything compact in one thing. So, she's in plie and I offer the hand. And I can see, I have space in between her. And she is on her leg to do the penche. I'm over here. Are you guys watching? Yeah? She goes up. To attitude. I have her here. You can do with one hand, if your'e very comfortable. If not, just two. Then, you're gonna lean her out a little bit off balance, then you're gonna put her back. I switch my hands before I have to do that turn. There's no way that she's gonna turn by herself. So, I have to have some kind of whip here, you know. I do the whip. Then, she is on her leg for me to switch to the hip, so, she is in penche. Yeah? I'm gonna do the same. This is already gonna turn her. One time this way and then up down. You guys are the one driving the car. Yeah? And she's the one that can get all lyrical and do her thing. So, let's hear from ta-da-da-ra... [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] One, two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight, on one. One, two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight and one, two, three, four, penche, over, seven... [JULIE KENT] It's been a natural gift for him since he was a young young dancer. He loves partnering and he revels in it. It's a joy for him. So, it's a joy for me to be the recipient of all the effort. The enigma is that the sign of a really good partner is that your invisible. If you can see that guy making it work, it's not a great thing. I can do whatever my body feels and wants to do and I know he's going to be there and make me look good. So, I'm fearless with him. He does sacrifice all of his ego, you know, in order to serve his girl. It's rare. He has a moral, emotional support that he brings to his partnering, which is truly exceptional. You can't be selfish. I think that's the best advice that I can give you. Everything that you do is in order for your ballerina to feel comfortable. People are not really looking like, "Oh, how is he doing that switch of the hand?" If she falls off-point, then it's something that they're gonna notice. Yeah? So, for me, it's the most important thing, a hundred percent, it's her. You have to be able to be completely humble but also, you have to be completely confident. So, it's an opposition that a lot of people don't think about. It's a tough thing to grasp. But when you do, it feels really, really good because then, you dance together. I never think about partnering as something that I will do before I dance my variation. I think about it as one. [MARCELO] How are you? [BLAINE HOVEN] Good. [DOG BARKING] Are you okay? [MARCELO] Blaine is a dancer with ABT, and he's one of my best friends in the company. Why do I love dyeing my hair? [MARCELO HUMMING] [BLAINE] I'm thinking of getting a perm. [MARCELO] Do you? [MARCELO] I like your hair curly. [BLAINE] Well, I'm accentuating the curl a little bit, so, it's gonna let you get more pronounced. Sir, would you like some champagne? Please. [HAROLDO] He's always different. Very different from any other boy. He was different from my older son. I came out in a very big way. I was on the cover of The Advocate. I didn't think that it was gonna be such a big deal but I guess it was. I saw principle dancers that were older than me, look at me wide-eyed, saying, "Oh, my God, aren't you scared of the repercussions that this might have with your fans, with the people who are coming to watch you?" I said, "Absolutely not." I'm still going to be a man on stage. I'm still going to play Romeo and Onegin and, you know, Conrad the Pirate. And I'm not going to be a homosexual pirate. [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna be a pretty straight one, you know. It's a role. I'm acting. Everybody go, one, like, altogether one cause sometimes, it's a little slow for some of you. And, hup! That's good, alright, nice. Good good. [MARCELO] Sergei Danilian asked me to choreograph a piece for the Kings of the Dance, which is a tour of the top male ballet dancers. I still have a big dancing career ahead of me, but being creative and inspired in the studio with dancers is definitely something that I want to do. I'm certainly not the choreographer that I will be in five years. I have to start somewhere. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] I think that for me, what really is important is to show the softness, and how masculine both of those things can be shown as a male dancer. [DAVID HALLBERG] Marcelo has this instinct of knowing how to carry the room. When I see him choreographing, it's not murky, it's not cloudy. It's a clear vision. It's amazing to see how he has developed his own vocabulary. Kings of Dance, we're gonna rock the show in Kiev, on October sixteen. Kings of Dance, we're gonna rock, rock, rock, the show on October sixteen. The date's kind of lame. Gonna work with it, ♪ Kings of Dance, we're gonna rock the show in Kiev ♪ ♪ on October sixteen ♪ ♪ Kings of Dance, we're gonna rock, rock, rock, the show ♪ ♪ On October sixteen ♪ ♪ On October sixteenth ♪ ♪ Piece of dance ♪ [GUILLAUME COTE] His concentration is so present because he's so clever. He's always one step further than everyone else and I do think that it's a quality that every great choreographer needs to have. And it's a quality that he was born with. So, I think he is born to be a phenomenal choreographer. [ALL HUMMING] [HUMMING RISES AND STOPS] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING] Yes, I do want to fall in love. I would love to get married. And I love children. I think it's in me to be a father. I think I would be fun but yet strict. I would teach my kids what ballet and dance has taught me about commitment, about passion, about going for something like that in your life. I, perhaps, wouldn't lose track of my family. I would want to be present in my kid's life as they get older. This is something that I do not experience right now. There is this incredible void to know that your father is alive and here, but he's not present in your life. That's really tough to deal with. I've had some really incredible performances here, in Russia. The audiences, they... They appreciate ballet. They know ballet. They are ballet fanatics. Which is great for us. But there is a certain amount of pressure when you dance here. [GRACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DIRECTOR] Marcelo, would you like to take some rosin into you palms? [MARCELO] Yeah. [MUSIC RESUMES] [POLINA SEMIONOVA] Marcelo partnering? This is the gift. He knows, sometimes better than I know, where I should be. He feels the woman amazingly. This is the most raked that I've ever danced in. It's pretty alarming, even just looking at it. When you look at it, it's wild, it's a really big ramp. When you're in the middle of the stage, you don't feel it as much, but when you're down by the orchestra or up high, then that's when you feel it a lot. Dancers that live here are trained in raked stages and the studios are raked and so, they don't know any better. Or they don't know anything different. So we tried it a couple of times and what we need to do is just take our time to go up into the life. Instead of rushing it. Usually, it's not a problem but I think, because of the rake, it's a little bit more challenging. My costume is a little bit uncomfortable. I can't quite stretch my arms. I can't lock my elbows, so, I'm partnering her like this. Which is harder to hold. Also, her skirt has a lot of tulle. I'm not used to that much tulle. So, it's a bit slippery in my hands. So, that's why I went to put rosin on. So, I just have to grab her where I need to grab her before it goes up. Because then, once it goes up, and I'm not in the right place, then that's where we land into trouble. I would say that boys will always, in all countries, will be more difficult to teach dance than girls. Honestly, it's my opinion. I know how hard it is to find a good boy. Right. To teach them correctly, and to keep him in ballet, and to graduate and then to help him go further. They're very fortunate to be here. Thank you. ...Baryshnikov's costume ...and Nureyev's costume, he also graduated from the school. [WOMAN] Nijinsky's outfit. Nijinsky, Balanchine also graduated from here. [MARCELO] Wow. The Swan Lake, the Nutcracker and the others were created here. And they were rehearsed here, composed here and produced here. In this building. Forty-three ballets of Marius Petipa. It's too much. I can't. It's only ten minutes in. So, the ballet stars like Nijinsky, Nureyev, Baryshnikov... They would come here for rehearsing. Pushkin's lesson with Baryshnikov, It was in this room. Right. [INHALES] Breathe in some inspiration. Oh my God. I am opening the 180th season of the Mikhailovsky, on a really raked stage. What am I gonna do? [MARCELO] For me, Giselle is the ultimate ballet. It's perfect. It's a heart-wrenching story. I care so much about this role. Out of any classical role and repertoire it's the one that I'm most dive-in. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] If I had to choose a role to dance for the very last time, it would be Albrecht in Giselle. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] In that moment, in second act, Albrecht is dancing for his life. [CROWD APPLAUDING] As Albrecht, I choose to do the entre six, when Myrtha tells him to. To keep dancing. I know how difficult they are but I think its adds to that overall feeling, of not being able to stop dancing. [ORCHESTRA MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CLAPPING] [CROWD CHEERING] I'll see you in a bit. [EXHALES IN PAIN] [MARCELO] That was really scary. I heard like a crack. Like, during the show. I think, maybe I'll just ice it right away. Yeah, last time, It was this one on the rake. In Don Quixote, remember? [MARCELO] I've had two surgeries. The first one on my ligament on my right ankle. The second because I had chronic tendinitis in my left knee. I danced with both injuries for a while before surgeries. In order for it not to trigger, so I'm much more aware. Right. So, then, in fifth position, is it worse in the back, than it is in the front? Or does it...? [JULIE] About the same? [MARCELO] Fifth is worst in the front. Okay Have you sprained this one? More than the other one? No, I sprained this one a year ago. But that one's different anyway, because of your surgery. [JULIE] And there? [MARCELO] I feel a little bit there. So, that's more the deltoid ligament. Right. A cortisone injection if you can't get rid of that pain. That will take the inflammation down and, sort of, give you a chance for that to go away. And the other thing we can do is the PRP type injection to try and get it to boost that healing process to make it swell up again and then that starts the scarring down. Right. If you're really not able to get over this next phase, - into full jumping... - Okay. Then we would consider doing that. [MARCELO] Injury is the main thing that affects a dancer's career. What kind of injuries and how serious they are. It's amazing how much you can push your body to do what you love. In ballet, you have to learn how to manage pain. [JOEL PROUTY] Can you please give me 20 push-ups. [MARCELO] I'll be dancing La Bayadere with the Tokyo Ballet in Japan. [MARCELO] The role of Solor in La Bayadere, it's an extremely taxing role to dance because it has big dancing. Big jumps, multiple pirouettes, big leaps, the double saut de basques, the pas assemble, double tours, going all the way down to the floor, on the knee, and then partnering to ballerinas. [JOEL] I think that weight's good. I think you gotta get in front deeper. [MARCELO] Uh-huh. [JOEL] Okay? If you were to life a girl from down here, you're not gonna wait till here to do a dead shoulder press. Especially, at the end of the pas de deux. Come on. Pick it up. It's too late. It's too late. You're not gonna make it through. I can pick ten guys in this room that can do this, and no one can do what you can do. Come on, let's go. Bring it in. All the way up. From the bottom. Flatten this out. Up. Yeah, baby. Good! [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Okay. I think we should start, guys. Okay? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC BEGINS AGAIN] [MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY] [MUSIC STOPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MARCELO] As you get older, it takes more time to recover. You can probably do the performance but it's the toll that it takes on your body. My father will never get to see me dance this role. But I hope he will come to the Metropolitan in New York to see me dance other roles before I retire them. I told Diana about it being the last one, so. Yeah, no, I'm excited. Here we go. Tomorrow. Let's do it. Go out with a bang. This foot can just fall off. I think, in the middle of the show. Break, doesn't matter. No, God forbid. For me, the role of Solor in Bayadere is the most difficult role to dance. It's a beast to conquer. Every male dancer will tell you that. It's a beast. It's like, mentally prepared, physically prepared, everything. Oh my Lord. Just Bayadere, you know. [EXHALES IN PAIN] It hurts too much. [MAN] Your ankles? Yeah. Hurts my ankles a lot. [MARCELO] Because it's all in one leg. It's all either pushing up from the left or landing on the left. Turning on the left. So all the whole ballet's... [MAN] On your left foot? Yeah. Feeling a bit emotional about it, for sure. Just 'cause... I wanted to do it for so long. You can't have fasted rehearsal process and that's what takes the toll. You have to practice the jumps, you have to do the maneges, you have to do cabrioles. Once you've proven to yourself that you can do it that way, then, why take a step back and make this a little bit easier? Part of it is that my standards are high for myself but think that's a good thing. I'm officially retiring La Bayadere.

Definitely. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Definitely. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] Definitely. That's why. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [CROWD APPLAUDING] Yes! It's a good way to tie everything up. Thanks, Helga. You taught it to me first. I know. Remember? - I remember. - Yeah. I remember. It was a good one. A good one to go out with. I think. It was very nice. Diana and I are very connected. That was the most important thing for me. It's bittersweet. It's definitely bittersweet. But I think I'll... I'll leave with joy. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [MARCELO] Being the only boy was a bit of a challenge. I knew ballet class was where I needed to be. More than anything, I love to partner a ballerina on stage. When you're partnering a ballerina, you have to be in total control. But you also have to let her shine. The big classical roles have a deadline. I see myself dancing as long as my body can take.
