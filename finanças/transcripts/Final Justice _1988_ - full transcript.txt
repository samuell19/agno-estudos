-Hey, recently... -Take this, I'll call you up next time. Wow! I think I'm going to faint. The buildings are all made of glass and could easily collapse! Judge, count me in if you have any good gigs. Count you in? Forget it! Hey, do you like it? -You son of a bitch! -Hey! Leave no trace in the car, kid. -Okay! -Got that? What does the word on his back mean? A foul word. Let's go get some whores. What the hell? Attention! Good morning. -Sergeant. -Morning. -Hey, Seven. -What? You signed in for the boss? Yes, that's because I'm smart. Times have changed. The new boss doesn't like that kind of practice. So, don't blame me if it comes up. It won't as long as you keep quiet, Chiu. How can you say that? I'm just giving you sound advice. Sergeant, we'll all go down if they know about this. You signed it last week. Shut up! I don't need your advice. Don't say that I didn't warn you. The new inspector Lo is strict when it comes to rules. He's notorious for scolding people. I heard that too, while I was in training. I'm not too worried about him. How dare you! You're still new and you simply refuse to learn! Good morning, Inspector Lo. Where's the sign-in book? It's right over there, sir. Why is it over there? Who's on duty today? I am, sir. Where are the other guys? Unit Six is in court today. Units Three and Five are out, and the others are all in. Sergeant Cheung signed in five minutes ago, where is he now? -He just went out for work. -Work? Where is he now? I've been here for a week but I've yet to see him. I want to see him in 15 minutes. Get him over here! Are you all listening? No discipline at all. What's so funny? Get back to work! Chiu, you talked too much this time. What are we supposed to do now? Who told you to rub the boss the wrong way? I didn't tell you to talk. It's your own fault. Listen, Kong, you're the only one who knows the boss' number. Please contact him now. Please! You should beg the sergeant. It's none of my business. Help me. I'm only helping my own boss. -Hello. -It's Kong, where are you? I'm making love right now. The new CI wants you to come back to the station. Quickly get over here. Get over there? He must be crazy. You have to be back in 15 minutes. I have things to do now. We'll talk when I come back. You've finally decided to show up. PUBLIC TRUCK PARKING AREA Damn! Hey, you motherfucker, why did you stop the bike so suddenly? Are you crazy? I'm sorry. You could have been killed. What's going on? -Are you crazy? -Hello, the road is for public use! You can swear at me, but not at my mother. Fortunately, I was quick! Move that away immediately! You've put other people's lives at risk! Is that truck yours? Yes, so what? Come here, I want to talk to you. You're under arrest. Let's go check what Gi is doing. Don't get all quiet all of a sudden. Swear at me some more. I didn't mean to swear at your mother. What? Hey, what are you doing? Don't run! -Get him! -Yes, sir. -He's going in that direction. -Leave me here! Beat him up if he tries to escape! Don't move, or I'll hit you. Why did you hit me? -I told you not to move. -Why did you hit me? You dare hit back? Run! Run, don't stop! Run! Run. Keep running. You can't be any faster than my bullet. You're going to run back to where we were. Go back to where we were now! Go! Wow, what a lucrative return. -Check how many bikes there are. -There are a few boxes of spare parts too. Give me the total amount. -To you? -Of course. Check with the owner of the tow truck after taking their statements. Sergeant, come here. I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know that you were a cop. -You swear that you're a good citizen? -I am a good citizen. How did you catch those three suspects? These three suspects-- Can I get a good citizen award? If not, I'll give you one myself. These three suspects stole that truck. I went down to catch them. Inspector Lo. What happened? The district sergeant was smart and caught three guys, and retrieved a truckload of Yamaha motorbikes! He's right over there. 105663. -From which department? -Regional Crimes, Unit One. Boss, this is our new head of department. How are you, sir? -Hey, man. -Sir. The suspects said that they have to-- Forget about them. Help my friend out first. Thanks, sir. This truck was stolen. What should we do about it? Find the owner, what else? You're Sergeant Cheung. Return to the station immediately. Write me a detailed report on this case. Sir, some reporters want to interview you. Tell them to wait. Go right away! -What do we do now? -Go and wait in the car. Inspector Lo was in a rage this morning. He found out that you didn't come in for a whole week. But I was working in the field! I have been in the field for over ten years. I've seen enough fierce bosses! But he's really ferocious. Lock him up first. Watch out. Sir, you didn't write down my address. Inspector Lo. Why are you writing here? Is this your office? No discipline at all. Sit down. I am used to standing, sir. My report for today. What is this? Was this written by a child? Rewrite it. I spent two hours writing this up. You can understand it. I've read over your file. You've been working for over ten years, and you've got over a hundred complaints. Right, but many commendations as well. Didn't you read that? It's over here in this file. Here in this file. Do you know what this means? I know all 28 letters. But, it's difficult when it's put together. Sergeant Cheung, don't be impudent. You're so cocky! And you treat your superiors rudely. Inspector Lo, I've always respected my superiors. And I'm always responsible. I haven't even seen you for the whole week. Do you call that responsible? I've been watching those guys for the past week. Can I catch robbers if I sit in the station all day? What are you implying? I am the one in charge here and you must listen to me. I'll sack you if you don't! From now on, you must abide by the rules. And sign in every single day, understand? Where are you off to? Weren't you done? If so, I would like to write my report again. You don't want me to stay here, do you? Concise, fluent and accurate. If he still doesn't understand this, I have no idea. Sergeant, how did the CI reward you? Damn him, it took me a whole week to catch those suspects. Now he wants to fire me. He's a hard boss. Be patient. He's a smart officer on the fast track. Don't simply compliment just anyone. Even if get sacked, you're still not qualified to replace me. Go to hell. -Hey, sir! -You're still here? What about my good citizen award? I'll call you when it's ready. Be patient. Thanks. Boss, the report. I want to complain about him. He hit me for no reason at all. Shut up, don't say anything at all. I gave him permission to hit you! I've received over a hundred complaints anyway. He hit you, right? Remember my name. Lock him up, no bail. Follow me. Why are you so happy? Sit down. Good, thanks. What did you write here? "Check" means to investigate. Why didn't you just write it in Chinese? What does this word starting with "L" mean? "Location", it means where the scene is. Why didn't you just write it in Chinese? If you're so good at English, why don't you write the whole thing in English? Rewrite the whole thing by referring to this. What is it? Boss, I can't read scribbles. Do I have to write it in English? Use it for reference. Then, let me sign it. I know all the alphabets and about a hundred Chinese characters. I have been an officer for a long time. You're so brilliant. You're the district sergeant, right? Of course. What do you think of my office? It's very big. I don't come here often. You've been here all afternoon. You can go home now. Sure. Thank you, sir. Don't forget my award. Time for a tea break! Judge, what's the background of this old man? He owns these two buildings. Yes? Hey! Judge. Chicken. Where are you? At the whorehouse. Get to the pier immediately! Okay, I'm coming. Hey, room checking. Present your ID cards. What? My penis has retreated. I've tried her before. Hey, Bull! You must be in a good mood now. Yes, I feel so much better now. Man, don't go anywhere. The stuff will arrive tomorrow. We need to find some capital tonight. Chicken, go to Bill's gambling place. I'll win for sure. Judge, what do you think? There's a good business opportunity. Let's finish off the gambling joint first. We've got millions of dollars to pocket. Then, we can call as many prostitutes as we want. Remember, you can do all that next week. But tonight, we need to work and all be alert! I'll get back what I have lost. L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. There are 29 letters altogether. There can't possibly be one more. I just don't have the talent for English. -Sergeant Lo and Seven, come on over! -Yes! I'm going out to patrol and you two will take charge of this place. But... Just pretend like you don't know. Just call me if anything happens. I'll be back in 15 minutes! Boss, but... Hey! Hello, what is it? -Hey. -Hi, Judge. What's up? Get me a car. Okay, when do you need it? I need it quick. I'll see you at the old spot in 20 minutes. No problem. Don't be late! WORLD TODAY CRB. I'm a district sergeant, 105663. Please check on this for me. A Volkswagen, Function 60, plate number Delta-Fox-5654. It's a private car, silver in color. Check if it's a stolen car. Wait a minute. Damn you, motherfucker! What did you say? I'm sorry, I wasn't cursing at you, ma'am. Repeat the license plate number. Delta-Fox-5654. The owner is Mrs. Johnstone. Her address is at Lot 66, Repulse Bay. Judge. It's great. Judge, take me with you. Next time. -The car was not reported as stolen. -Thanks. Hey, smartass. What are you doing here? Stand still! I asked you to stand still. Don't run! Hey, watch it! -Hey! -You'll regret it if you run again! Stand still! What is it? Stand still! Why should I? I told you to stand still. You're crazy! Don't run! Motherfucker. -Let me go. -Why didn't you just stand still? You didn't listen to me. Let me go! I'll break your skull. Let me go, or I'll beat you up. Let go! Don't move! Move an inch and I'll shoot. I'm not going to, really. Don't run. Okay. Move aside. Don't be impulsive, you might misfire. Cuff yourself. -Cuff yourself! -Sure. No problem. Cuff yourself to the railing. Quick. It's locked, okay? If only I knew! -Hello. -Chicken. -Speaking! -We'll be arriving soon. What time? -Around one o'clock. -No problem. Okay, let's go. All right, I'll go. Sergeant Cheung, what time did you arrest him? I almost lost one of my balls because of that asshole. Luckily, I've found it now. Sergeant Cheung, I asked you what time you arrested him? Half past twelve. Okay? You're going to get it. Where has that car gone? Come with me if you lose. What can I do for you? How about it? Please, come on in. How much have you lost? About 250,000 dollars. You've got to be kidding me. Please, come on in. Sir, how many chips do you want to exchange? All of them. Boss! Don't move! Get down! How dare you come to gamble. So much money! Kill! Get down! Don't even breathe! Don't come after us. Or you won't be so lucky. Let's go. Why don't you try fighting back? Chicken, we can go now. You're a rich man now. Give me a few thousand dollars. Don't move. This was their car. What's going on? The joint was just robbed! If I become sterile, I will kill your whole family! If so, I'll help you. Where did you steal that car? Did you see me stealing it, sir? DE 5456, 5546. Be careful of what you're accusing me of. Do you think that I'm stupid? I have all the records at the police station. Don't try to trick me. Move! Here, don't go walking around. Is it true? Sit down. Sit properly. What's going on? Boss, this is a school headmaster. The girl said that he molested her. He said that you bumped into him yourself. Of course, he would say that! What a pretentious scum. Such a beast. Lady, I've seen you with Saboman. Are you one of his girls? Who's Saboman? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't act dumb. You failed to pick his pocket. So now, you're framing him. Pick his pocket? Don't go around accusing me of such a thing! He molested me. Why are you questioning me instead? -What's the matter here? -Inspector Lo. I don't know what this guy is about. Shut up and sit down. -I have been molested. -Sit down! Don't I have a right to talk? -Stop bullshitting. -Inspector Lo. I suspect that this girl is from a pickpocket gang. After a failed attempt, they're now trying to accuse this guy of molesting her. Who is in charge of this case? Chiu is in charge. That's me, sir. I really didn't do anything like that. -Speak only when you're questioned. -I'm a teacher. It's Chiu's case. Why are you here then? I caught a car thief. Hey, don't say that yet. I didn't steal any car. What car did he steal? The car was driven away. I was walking along the street when he hit me and accused me of stealing a car. You are so unprofessional. Don't you have anything better to do? Come with me! Stand straight. -Chiu! -Inspector Lo, I'm all ears. Someone has been injured. -Go check out the case at the scene. -Okay. Seven. Lock him up and go to court tomorrow. I thought that I could get off duty. Come here! You've got the wrong guy. You're way too optimistic. Take him down as well. Watch out for him, he's cunning. Hey, don't mess around, man! Just go! Working... -Inspector Chan, what's the matter? -Sir. -The gambling joint just got robbed. -Is that right? What are you doing here? The boss told me to have a look. The case was handed to homicide. -Two dead, one seriously injured. -It's that bad? The big boss is here, too. Don't play around with him. Hey, Delta-Fox-5654. Sir, is this a stolen car? Yes, the owner is Mrs. Johnstone. Right. What is it? Is it something to do with this car? Could be. Do you have anything for supper? Since the homicide unit has taken over, we can go home early today. Are you the one who decides? Go stand beside the car. Go, Chiu. Damn, he only listens when I speak in English. Many superiors are here, and I don't want to say anything wrong. I'll be going, bye! Where's Boli? Where are the goods? How much? Twenty thousand dollars, including your watch. You're a thief. Don't move! Do you want me to shoot? Don't! Come on, don't play tricks. Just give me the watch. Here. One gun is not enough. Are there any more? Yes. Bring me the long one. How much? Forty thousand dollars for one, eighty thousand dollars for two. It's solid. Chicken, give them the money. I'll pay you another 200,000 dollars for your men's guns. What do you think? What? Two hundred thousand dollars? Come on, guys! Give them all of it, sell them all of it. We'll sell them the bullets as well. Great, give me the money. Give it to him. Give me the money. Pack it carefully. Ten thousand dollars for each of you! You make up your mind fast. Here's a gift! Why did you keep one from us? Do you want to get slashed? I've paid you in full. Don't rip me off. This is Hong Kong. I won't take advantage of you. Let's go. -Good morning. -Morning. How was the case last night? Homicide has taken over the robbery case of the gambling joint. Two dead and one seriously wounded. Do you have any idea who did it? The owner of that joint is Bill. I think he knows who did it. But, they won't talk. Any other leads? The car that the robbers left. It is the same one used by the guy I caught last night. I suspect that the two cases are related. Good, then go and get the paperwork ready. And charge him with car theft, robbery, and murder. Sir, isn't that a bit too much? I didn't mean it that way. I mean, that kid was caught and put into a cell in a different location. So, we don't want to charge the wrong guy. Sergeant Cheung, we enforce the law. We don't judge whether he's guilty or not. That's the duty of judges, not you. Anything else? We've got the right guy but the wrong charges. Let me out, do you hear me? I won't give you any water if you keep on screaming. Don't go. Come over here. I'm not done yet. If I pass out, I'll sue you. Damn you! Sergeant, let that monkey out. I'll teach him a lesson myself. God, my wrist. Now you show up. What have I done wrong? You can't lock me up for more than 48 hours. You're up to your neck and you're still mouthing off? Stop bluffing with me. You can't do that in court, you need actual evidence. All right, let's see if the judge will trust you or me. I'm frightened, really. Someone's committing suicide. Sergeant, open the gate! What's going on! Stand over there, kid. Help. -Call the ambulance. -Okay. What is up? Tell the DO that a prisoner has hanged himself. What a huge mess. Wake up! He's okay. Quick! Come! Stand aside. What's going on? I didn't molest her! Hey, Inspector Lo is here. -Step aside. -What are you doing? -The prisoner tried to hang himself. -Hang himself? You said that you're innocent but now you tried to take your own life. Why didn't he just die? Then the school kids will be safe at least. The guy's in there. Right. He's better dead than alive. Then, there will be no one to rebut the allegation. If cops can be trusted, then pigs can fly. What did you say? Why are you here? I took him out to get a statement. Inspector Lo, I have his file. He's unemployed and probably involved in the robbery. Don't try to frame that on me! Since when was it your turn to speak here? Chiu, lock him up. I want to see my lawyer first. -Go! -Don't push. -Don't push? -Go! There's no smoking in here. Get me his statement now! Thanks. I'm no luckier than you. Let's go. Let's go. Now. You won't admit to stealing the car? What a stupid question. Why are you treating me so well? I don't want to see you starve to death. I want to avoid the trouble of having to take you to the hospital. You must cooperate after this meal. That dirty trick again. Your boss is quite harsh! Who are you talking about? Sir Inspector, he would frame just anyone. How dare you insult the Royal Hong Kong Police! I'm right. He almost made the old guy kill himself. And, you got scolded. Don't talk so much. It will be worse if I wanted to frame you! But you won't. Do you know what I'm charging you with? Maybe "attacking your penis"? Don't act so arrogant. I'm charging you with car theft, robbery and murder. You're even worse than your boss. Don't look at me like that. I've found the car that you stole. That car was proven to have been used for a robbery. Two died and one was wounded. But I was taken here when I got out of the car. How could I have robbed a place when I'm locked in the cell? So you admit that you stole the car. Sure. I won't get hanged for that. Tell me, who did you hand the car over to? I'm not bluffing. I don't know anything. I expected that you wouldn't confess. You'll be in prison to take the fall. You should have a bright future in Stanley Prison. Bring that chair over. -Come on, help me out. -Don't touch me, you've got germs. Boss. What are you doing? Have you got nothing else to do? -No. -No. Come with me for a ride. We're taking him out? -What's going on right now? Tell me! -Go. Go. Go where? What do we have to do? Whatever. Do I have to report to you? You're crazy. I gave him the car here last night. They live on the top floor, but I don't know which flat exactly. Take me up there. Are you crazy? I'll get killed. If they're in the house, I'm dead. Are you bargaining with a cop? What do you want to do? Just let me go up alone first and check what's going on, then I'll report to you. I would have to be a moron to let you go up there alone. All right, I'll let you go. -Let him go. -Come on. Should have done this earlier. Boss, this guy is playing us. I wouldn't be a cop if he escaped. Come over. Go on up. Wait here for me. Don't play any tricks! I wonder what's he up to. You watch at the end of the street, and you watch the corner. I'll follow him. Should I tell Inspector Lo about this? Are you ass-kissing again? You're right, I like kissing ass. Placed any bets on horses? Yes, I have taken my meal. What an answer! These horses are odds. Where did you go last night? Don't bow out. Go! Charge! Not this one, faster! Damn! Faster! Damn you. Judge. Who's there? It's me, boss. Don't shoot. What are you doing here? Looking for you guys. -Come up here. -You are acting suspiciously. Thanks. -I almost killed you. -Unexpected. Bull, why did you shoot? It was just an accident. I heard that you robbed a joint last night. You're smart. Are you checking up on us? No, they're looking for you. I came here to warn you. I'm not afraid even if an army comes. -You're a fool! -Of course. Right. -Wait for me outside. -Okay. Bull, even the kid knows about it. Don't think about it, we'll take it as it comes. No. Let's pack up and go. With these many guns, we can go anywhere. Go away, they have machine guns. Go. Quick. -Let's go. -Okay. Excuse me. Come on. All right. I'll bring the car over. What car? Can't we take a taxi? What should we do now? The boss is still not here. Let's go and see. Let's go. Go. Go. You're so talkative. Let's deal with it. Stay composed. Excuse me. Step aside. So you finally decided to show up. You're Judge. My nickname is Dummy. How dare you rob my joint? Let's check it out. So many guys! Mother... I'm the marksman! Help us out, kid. I'm Judge, come out now! Where did they all go? That's enough. Don't come out! They have machine guns! Stay put. Give me that. Stop. Listen to me. How can you bargain with a cop with a gun in your hand? How many shots did you fire? I can find that out later anyway. Where did you get the gun from? After you stole a car, robbed and killed, you cause a shoot-out? What else are you involved in? I don't know. I only stole a car. Sir, I need to tell you something. Wait for me in my office. Chiu. Take him down to the cell. I'll charge him personally. You think you're Rambo, don't you? You didn't inform me of such a big case? Do you want me to take the blame? Had I known that they possessed such massive weapons, I would've informed you, sir. All right, what's your relationship with that kid? How dare you let him out to kill people! I don't know how you got promoted to this rank. I got promoted for my contribution to the resolution of cases in my ten years of service. I am now in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department. I know that the kid didn't kill anyone, so I took him out to assist with the investigation, sir! What are you yelling for? I was afraid that you wouldn't hear me, sir! You... You're no longer handling this case. From now on, you will stay at the station. Thanks for looking out for me, sir! Sergeant. What did Inspector Lo say? He told me that I'm off the case. What? I was the one who caught the guy. Now, he will be accused of murder. I know that he is innocent. You can't fight with a chief inspector. I don't care. I don't feel bad for any of that. -I have no regrets. -Yes. I will fight. So what? Boss. Make it quick. Damn you! You and your boss framed me! If I wanted to frame you, you would be dead by now! Don't mess around with me! Go to hell! Stand straight. Bastard. I'll kill you if you move even an inch again. I wanted to help you. Had you just cooperated, we wouldn't be in this situation. Cooperate with you? You're asking me to be a traitor! You just want to get promoted. And I'll betray my friends for you? Don't ever expect any information from me! Don't worry. That's not what I'm here for. I've come to tell you to prepare for a life sentence. Don't bluff! I just stole a car! And now you are held liable for murder. Please don't make me laugh. Listen! This is what they are charging you with now! You were seen holding the gun from which four bullets were found in a corpse. How do you explain that? Judge threw the gun to me. I didn't fire it! How can you prove that? If you want us to believe you, help us find Judge. But even you cops can't find him! I want to know where he frequents. Their house had already been destroyed by you guys. Listen, I'm not handling this case anymore. If you don't cooperate, even if you can afford the best lawyer, you will be kept in custody for at least six months. Thanks, Sergeant. You're the one who will be in prison. Mr. Cheung! What do you want from me? Hurry up! Walk faster! -Boss. -Hey. -Needless to say, thanks. -Sure. But he has to be in court tomorrow at 10 a.m. He would better be back by 9 a.m. Good, don't worry. Not at all. We're in this together. If you're not scared, why should I be? -Good, I'll be going now. -All right. Hello. Where are you now? At the whorehouse. There are some problems. Come back now. -Now? -Now! All right, I'll be quick. Where's the foreign girl? I've called her. I don't have much time. Speak of the devil. Wait here. She is here now! -Come! -Wait. So, where is it? Judge brought me here once. I can't remember which block but it was on the 13th floor. What's the background of the other two guys? One is named Bull, the other is Smut. Both of them were just released from jail. You won't accompany me, then? Relax. Where can I possibly go when I'm all cuffed like this... I'll give it to you. No need to search for it. Don't play any tricks on me. Just stay put over here. Let's go, Smut. I'm just trying to make a living. You brought so many weapons, you could expose us easily. Don't tell me how to do things. How much? Never mind. You said it. Want a girl, Mister? No. We have nice ladies here. Are there men? You want to get AIDS? I didn't have time to check out the color of her pubic hair. Any foreign girls? No, get lost! Jenny, there's a gun. What gun? Haven't you seen a gun before? Shut up, you bitch. We're all going back up. Don't step out of the elevator. They will really use it. Don't come out, go back up. My friend, 13th floor, Block D. Don't be afraid, I'm a cop. Call the police. Let's get a taxi over there. Judge is waiting for us. Can't you walk any faster? Taxi! Across the harbor. Why didn't you stop the car? Don't move. Put your hands on your heads. Get out of the car. Move! Not that way! Here! Stand beside the car. Take him down! Shoot! Did you take him down? I'll get a car! On your toes! Are they after us? Go away, bitch! Don't move! Get in! Go away! Now what? 999. We're at Freedom Road. There has been a shoot-out. Two suspects have fled in a red Jaguar. They've escaped to Argyle Street. Who are you? I'm a citizen. Listen. One of them has been shot. -Thank you, please tell me your name-- -No time, call an EU car to intercept him. -What now? -Let's go. You're going too. If not, I'll be taken to the police station too. Go now, the cops are coming. -Where did the shooting occur? -Where did the shooting occur? Keep it up. Stop the bleeding yourself. Help. Bull! Bring him inside! He's wounded! What happened? I don't know! We were ambushed by the cops! Step aside. How is it, Smut? Quit talking, bring him in. Smut, who shot you? Quick! Don't die! Tell me! Who shot you? I'll avenge you. Don't faint yet! Smut! Answer me! Smut! Smut! Answer me! Call a doctor. Are you crazy? You're not the one who's shot! Don't argue now. You're the one who said that. Why did he get shot? -You're fine. -Shut up! Can you save him by yelling? Smut, stay awake. The bullet is inside. He needs a surgeon. I'll try. Stay silent now. Come over. Do you trust me, Smut? All right, I'm going in! Rambo used this kind of knife to operate on himself. Why can't I find it? I found it. You're fine now. Smut will be okay. Judge, I found it! It was inside the bone. The bullet was stuck inside. Smut is gone. Smut! I'm willing to burn pretty girls for you. Tell me if there's not enough. I only wanted to save you. Please don't blame me, Smut. Tell us if it's not enough. Actually, it was not me who caused your death, but it was due to him pressing on your body. Don't say things like that to the dead. With the way you were digging, even a cow would have died. Why were there so many cops? Smut was always so cool and clever. Why couldn't it have been you who got shot? He wouldn't go when the cops appeared. If I hadn't found a car, I wouldn't even have been able to bring back his body. You're really something else. You can always ask Smut. Stop fighting. I think you pushed him out to be shot. Don't say that! That sounds like the truth. Do I look like such a person? You are known for doing those sort of things. Just let me know if you need anything at all down there. We'll move tomorrow morning. As quick as that! Get the kid first. Eat and tell me where I can get them. They blew it again. They wouldn't dare come out now. You have to make them come out. Or else tomorrow, you will be framed with more charges by the CI. Then, you're dead! Honestly, will I be kept safe if I help you find them? Yes, that will mean that the case is solved. Then I can prove that you're innocent. What is it? Excuse me for bumping into you. I'm not always right, but I'm never wrong. Sit tight. Stay put. Buddy, come on over. What is it? Where's your wallet? Where is it? Call the cops. Are you trying to frame me? -Take the wallet out. -What? What do you want from me? Don't fool around, stay put. Stay put. -I'll say that you've molested me. -Stand straight. What? Shut up! Bitch! -I caught you red-handed now. -You... Sir, over here. Why are you beating me? Sir, this girl is a pickpocket. -Is this your wallet? -Yes. You beat me. Take her to the station. Hey, buddy. What happened just now? That gentleman knows. Please show me your ID. I'm busy right now. It will save you a lot of paperwork if I don't give a statement. -Right, saves me a lot of time. -Right? Let's go. She looks decent but works as a thief. Are you any better than her? Where are we going now? Where to? A shower, a massage parlor, and a disco. -Why did you let them go? He hit me. -Shut up! I didn't see anything. -What would you like to order? -I don't have any money. I've found you, you bastard. You ruined my car in the last car race. How are you going to compensate for my losses? What did you say? I was hospitalized for a month. Are you bluffing? Give me 30,000 dollars and I'll let you go. Why don't you go and rob someone else? Who are you? I'm his boss. My name is Spade. Just shoot me. Rubbish! Mr. Cheung, if you cuff me up like this, people will know that I'm an informant. I'll be crushed if Judge even sees me. Trust me, I won't run. Boy! Where did you go the last time? Nowhere, I went for dinner with a friend. Dance with me. I'm not in the mood. You haven't seen me for two days. Come on. I'm tired. You really don't want to dance? I'm not in the mood. Then, I'll dance with somebody else. -Go on. -Come on. Hello, Regional Crimes, Unit One. Sergeant Lo! Boss, I've checked all the hospitals but no patient with a gunshot wound. What about clinics? I haven't gotten any reports. And the red Jaguar? We have a report of a Jaguar that was burnt. There was a corpse inside. Tell me when you know more. What are you doing? Nothing. Where are you going? What a coincidence. You've come to dance? Damn you! I don't want to dance. What hard luck I have. Let's go for supper later. So talkative. Let's set things straight. Definitely talking. Where's Boy? I don't know where he went. Why did you hit me? Because of your bad look. Did you double-cross us? I don't know anything. No? I'm not so sure. Don't beat me up. Don't beat you up? Get up. You look like an informant. You can tell Judge to come here. I have not done anything. Is Judge your father? Don't hit me again! Are you threatening me with Judge? I'm the Secretary for Justice! You ate too much. That's enough, Chicken. Do you really want to kill him? Did you spill our secrets? I can't make you trust me anyway. If I didn't trust you, you would be dead by now. I need a car. I'll call you tomorrow. We'll call you, bastard. Remember, don't try to escape. I've wanted to beat him up for the longest time. You were quite ferocious. I didn't even show my real strength. Careful! He almost died. The guys returned and attacked you? No, just some loan sharks. That's nothing? Let's go. Follow me. -Where to? -I won't take you to hell. Let's go. Take that off. It stinks. Why did you take me here? Are you scared that I'll rape you? This is my home. I'll take you back to the station after a shower. Boy, some new clothes. If you went to court in your old clothes, and with those two dolls? You'll get two more years. Hurry up, it's almost dawn. You will be dead if you keep hanging around with those guys. Kid, I've tried my best to help you. There's no better cop than me in Hong Kong. Mr. Cheung, can you help me out? I'm risking my career for you! Have you helped me at all? You lied to me that you were beaten up by loan sharks. I know that it was Judge who beat you up. So what? I'm doomed anyway. What else do you want from me? Sneak on them. I guarantee your life. If I do that, I will get killed. Every hooligan talks this way. You're the one who will go to jail, not me. Hurry up, I'll take you back after your shower. They asked for a car and said that they will call me later. And? Nothing else! Stop crying. You're a man! What's the use of crying? You look worse when you're crying. I was born like this. Why are you still helping me? I know that you're not totally bad. Because I was the one who arrested you and I don't want you to get framed. I will feel guilty. Those pigs beat me up the moment they saw me. Cops frame me when they see me. Why me? Because you hang around with the wrong people. Don't touch my bullet-proof vest. It saves my life. What should I do now? You better pray that he calls you before 9 a.m. tomorrow. If not, even God can't save you. Go and take a shower first. And stand straight or lie down on the sofa. I'm alert even while I'm sleeping. If you try anything, I will shoot you in the penis and you will become a girl. Go and take a shower. Hey. Thanks, Judge. Is that you, kid? Yes. Get the car to Caroline Hill Road at 9am. Don't be late. All right. There's still a lot of time left. If they show up, you won't even have to go to court. You'll be the bait. I'll be responsible for the arrest. No criminal has ever escaped from me once. Didn't you lose Chicken and Smut at the whorehouse? That was an accident. Mr. Cheung, I would be dead if you have an accident this time. Who can guarantee against accidents? Guess how many car accidents happen in a day? Number 23116! How did you even guard the cell? You know that the kid has to go to court. How could you let him out? But, Sergeant Cheung signed him out. We only wanted to crack the case, Inspector Lo. Bring Sergeant Cheung here. If I don't see him before 9:30 a.m., bring him back here with a warrant. Let's go. You're the best at stealing. The Royal Police is helping you steal a car. What's going to happen later, Mr. Cheung? Do whatever he tells you to do. I'll send people in to protect you. Are you scared? What should I be scared of when I have you around? How do you feel after last night? Where's Judge? Why do you want to know everything? Get to the Harbour Centre by 9:15 a.m. Go! Why are you always looking for Judge all the time? -Hello. -We're at the Harbour Road. Got it. Circle the area first. Regional Crimes, Unit One. Can I speak to Sergeant Lo? Is that you, boss? What's up? We're in trouble. Bring the kid back now! Let me talk to Inspector Lo. I've already put in a good word for you. Where are you now? Let me talk to Kong. Kong, it's for you. -Hello. -Hello. Inspector Lo has signed an arrest warrant out for you. Now what? Never mind him, I'm around Harbour Road. I suspect that there are three armed men. Bring the squad over and stay vigilant. Don't let Inspector Lo know about it, or we're screwed. Keep your spirits up. Follow me. Inspector Lo. Where's Sergeant Cheung? About this housing project, it's ready to start. We've invested 2.1 billion and we will get a 50 percent profit in return. Let's have breakfast first. Who are you looking for? Mr. Cheng. He's in a meeting. You can't go in. I'm the one who's meeting Cheng. Get out! Move! You can't go in there. Sit down. Go near the window. Shut up and listen to me. I want money, not your life. I want 50 million dollars in the next 15 minutes. There are many banks here. You can call the police if you want. -But Cheng will be the first one dead. -No! Cheng, you earn billions a year. You don't care. I want 50 million dollars in the next 15 minutes. Do you hear me? Give him the money. Don't beat him up, he's old. Bring the money. Give it to him quick. If we go to the bank for that amount of money, the bank will get suspicious. What if we give you all the cash in the company? Then, you can go immediately. Take them all out. Nancy, how much cash do we have? About 20 million dollars. -Bring it up here now. -Yes. -Don't call the police. -We won't. Go. Drive the car here and wait for us. Got it, loud and clear. We'll be right there. Drive back. Nothing is in Chinese! Hello? Stay here. Hello? Judge? We're here. Can you hear me? Hello? Quicker. Harder. More. Hello. Hello. We're coming down soon. Make sure it's clear everywhere. The money is here. Come on. Don't cry, I won't touch you. Another bite, quick. Kneel down. I have money. I can buy ten of you. You, take us downstairs. Go. The army is here. Control, we've arrived. Send EU to block all the exits on Harbour Road. I suspect that they're armed. Tell them to be careful. Got it. Check out the situation over there. Check out the situation over there. Check the building. Boss. Why is Inspector Lo here? Chiu ratted on us. Even the Consul knows now. When those robbers come out, they will know there are police. Keep track of that tall guy. He's armed. Send more men to help out. Come with me. Keep an eye on that guy. POLICE Do you want to die, old man? Then don't frown. If they resist, shoot them. Got it. Smile. What are you doing, Sergeant Cheung? Don't do this to me. I only owe you money. -Let's keep this to ourselves. -What are you doing? You bastard. Those two guys have guns. You're catching cops instead of robbers? Either shoot me or let me go arrest them! Don't move, police. You called the police. Drive. If I'm caught, you're dead. After them! Attention! The robbers' car is heading in the direction of the pier. Be careful. Get away! Shut up. No. Stop the car. Drive! This is so much fun. Drive faster. Get closer! Don't let them get away! I'll demote you if you lose them! BMW, DV 7234, pull over right away! They're still chasing after us. These guns are useless. Why did we come here? I don't know the way! This way! If you don't die, you'll be promoted. Get out of the van, quick! -Damn, there are so many cops. -Calm down. How can I be calm? Move! Attention! Siege the yacht club, over! Where do we go? Go! I'll cover you. Now what? Go! I can't take it any longer. Calm down. Bull, what's going on over there? It's bad. We can always just surrender. Don't talk. Get up! Listen, don't come any closer! Or I'll kill him! Come over if you dare. Bring the car over! Don't shoot. You are surrounded! Surrender now! What do you want to say? You talk too much. Get me the car! I don't have much patience left. Attention! The robber has a hostage, over. Get the car! Hurry! The hostage is his partner. Why did you open fire? Do I have to ask for your permission? Don't shoot. This is an oxygen tank. Or else, we'll all get blown up together. Retreat. I want to talk to the highest-ranked officer. Get me a car right now. I want to talk to the one who just yelled. Sir, he wants to speak to you. Didn't you hear that? The highest ranked! Come out, turtle. Go out and shoot him! If you're scared, I'll go. You'll be the first to die. You're bluffing! Come out, or I'll shoot you with this machine gun. Don't shoot! I surrender! You're crazy! How can you shoot at an oxygen tank? I don't want to be in this anymore. Many against one. Don't shoot, or you're indeed just a bunch of wimps! If you're heroes, don't shoot. Arrest him. All right. How are you? I won't die. Don't fool around. I didn't notice you just now. I know how to walk. I don't need you to carry me. I can walk. Now you're suddenly so brave. You've done it all alone. Was it fun? -Sergeant. -No more nonsense. You're indeed the toughest. I'm glad that you were the one who got me. You just have more people than I have. Take him in! -Stop arguing! -Let me go! Why did you shoot him? Hand back your warrant card and gun. You're suspended. My gun has been a part of me for over ten years. You're not qualified to take it. Why did you kill my informer? He's your informer? He's an accomplice. Did you see him in the robbery? Did you see him murdering people? Could you have cracked the case without him? You idiot! What did you say? I have a right to say anything! How can you talk to your superior this way? If I was any good in English, I would have been your boss! What? Arrest me! No, forget it. I will sack you! I'm the one who will sack you! Come to my office! No! Sir, don't argue with him. I will sack you! -Keep calm. -I'm so mad at him. He can say anything, having cracked this big case. Studying is the most important thing to becoming a police officer. Yes, sir. We'll go in next week. Is he crying? It's not that serious. I told you to cooperate with me. Now, you're dead! What did you just say? He's not dead. He just fainted. He got shot, right? My bullet-proof vest. My head hurts. Wait. Are you crying? Damn you! Why did you hit me? You stole my bullet-proof vest. I won't tell you if I am stealing it. You idiot! I hate foul language. Damn you, I'll beat you to death. You taught me that kind of language. How could you beat a patient?
