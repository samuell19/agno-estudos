Oh sorry. Waiter! Excuse me. Good evening, Louis. -Congratulations, Doctor. -You heard? All Paris knows. Your engagement was announced in the paper. -You don't approve. -On the contrary. But I thought your husband would be… the steady sort. Come on, quick! Hurry up, girls! Late again, you ninny! Why can't you be like the others? -It takes talent to be different. -Up you go, Charleston girls! Quickly! I fell in love as soon as he walked into my consulting room. -He came for analysis? -He was having nightmares. He dreamt a boa constrictor was suffocating him. -You found out what it meant? -Immediately. The snake represents a bond, the bond of marriage. Jean longs to marry but he's afraid. -And you cured him? -Yes. The second time, the boa had glasses. Very impressive. My only fault as a woman is to know what I want… and how to get it. Excuse me. Table eight want to pay in dollars. -Forgive me… Good luck, Doctor. -Thanks, Louis. Sorry! -Hello, darling. -Look at me. You're over-excited. That routine wears you out. We'll close a few days before the new show. -Then I'll have you all to myself? -Yes, dear. -My best wishes. -Already fulfilled! It's not every day you find the ideal woman. -I like that Louis Dubreuil very much. -Yes… -You're not so keen? -I prefer the boss, Paul Latour. -He's rarely here. -Unfortunately. -Who are those two by the bar? -Don't know. They've come often lately. Morning, Inspector. My condolences, sir. I heard the news this morning. Thanks, Lemoine. -What's this five-dollar bill? -A fake. -A forgery? -The same batch. Lincoln's nose is crooked and the watermark is very faint. Inspector Leduc here. Tell Dupuis to come to the lab at once. I see. Thank you. Rémy, the telephonist asked me to send you her condolences. Suzanne… Tell her I appreciate it. The inspector… I see. Thank you. Rémy, it's the other telephonist sending her condolences. -Tell her thank you… -Come in! Thank you. I just heard about your mother-in-law. -Please accept my condolences. -Thanks, Dupuis. -We're working on the Mississippi case. -The forged dollars. Exactly. I'll be taking some time off for my mother-in-law's funeral. The formalities… all there is to do. -I'd like you to work with Leduc. -Fine. What's the latest? A waiter's giving change in forged bills but it's Latour we're interested in. Lemoine, get me the Latour file. -Latour is back today for the new show. -Rehearsals. It's a shame for you. Such a fine case ruined by this funeral! Well, that's life. -It'll come to us all one day. -It's terrible. Yes, it's terrible when you think about it. -What are we in the end? -Nothing. -Nothing. -Nothing. We're here today, but tomorrow, who knows? Just look at my mother-in-law. Only yesterday she was eating her cassoulet… -Cassoulet? -She was a past master. -Really? -Better than any restaurant. Really? You amaze me. There's a place, Le Petit Bernard… In Rue Guénégaud? It's a speciality from Toulouse. -You don't know Rue Guénégaud? -No. -The cassoulet is wonderful. -It’s marvelous. We eat cassoulet. -What is it? -The Latour file. Right. Let's have a look. Arrested in 1942 for currency trafficking, current owner of the Mississippi. He must be the culprit. We'll bring him in, if we can find him. He disappears every so often and no one knows where to. -Have you seen Miss? -There, sir. -Where? -There. -Shit! -I see, thank you, Fernand. What are you doing, Brigitte? We should have left an hour ago. I'm trying to mend the damned pump. Language! It's not worth you going to France's best school. -Don't be old-fashioned, Daddy. -Wipe your face. It's oily. -If you heard us in the dormitory… -I can imagine. Get dressed and we'll be off. -I should be in the office. -I'm more important than work. A shipment's come in and I have to deal with Customs. -What are you doing? -Swimming. You're being naughty. I don't have enough time. Be good and hurry up. He's watering the swimming pool! Brigitte! Brigitte! Come out of the water or I won't let you spend next weekend with me. Brigitte, you're impossible. Hurry up. Brigitte! Your hair's soaking. We'll be terribly late. -The headmistress will be furious. -I don't give a fig. -Mind your language while I'm around. -I promise, Daddy dear! Blast, you're wet. Dash it, I said "blast". Sorry, Daddy. -She's a big baby. -A baby like that… What a dream. Leg, body, arm. You're not dipping deep enough, sir. -You sweat when you do it wrong. -I'd like to see you try. I trained the Duchess of Kent's eldest son in London. He never sweated. Of course not. It's cold in London. It's not climate that counts but economy of effort. Move your leg, body and arm separately instead of all at once, and there's no sweat. At least, less. -Sorry? -At least, less. Sorry. -Good morning, Doctor. -Morning, Jérôme. -What were you doing, Jean? -Trying not to sweat, my love. How awful! Try a different sport. Golf, cricket, pigeon-shooting, something more refined… less exhausting. Nice of you to come. You forgot the banns are published today? -Today? Impossible. -What? I've a rehearsal at the Mississippi. I can't keep Paul Latour waiting. -But our wedding can? -Of course not, my love. That's not what I meant. You're such a child. It'll take us half an hour and then you can rehearse. Daddy, stop! -What is it? -Let me drive to impress the girls. -I need the car in Paris. -I'll be careful. -Can I have it if I pass my exam? -I promise. Then you can give up work and we'll live happily ever after! -Agreed. -Is first gear like this? Look out! Brigitte! Mind all those people! Slow down! Brake! Brigitte! Look out! Brigitte, really! Headmistress. -You brought Brigitte back? -Yes. -Good weekend? -Excellent. She looks in fine fettle. Brigitte, say hello to the headmistress. She's a big baby. -Come on. -My jacket. -How's things? -Could be better. The banns are posted, the chain's around my neck. Today's the day! -Mr. Clary? -Yes. Inspector Leduc wants to see you. -What for? -A few questions. Did Paul Latour say he wasn't coming? He may simply be late. Let's hope so. Jean, it seems we've been handling forged notes… Thank you… Allow me to explain. Inspector Leduc. -Delighted. -You know Paul Latour? My best friend. I owe him my career. -You're close. -Yes. -Where is he? -No idea. -Latour doesn't confide in many people. -So it seems. -Want my opinion? -Go ahead. I may be wrong, but I think he has a daughter. -I've heard him phoning. -Where to? I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps a school. -Did you know Latour had a daughter? -No. No… Eleven forty. What time was he due to arrive? -Ten o'clock. -Right. We'll wait. -May I use your telephone? -Please do. Thank you. We can't twiddle our thumbs all day. -You can continue rehearsing. -Come on, girls! What an exciting job you have. Hello? Yes, it's me… Yes, darling… -Thanks for calling. Listen… -This is a silly joke, Jean. Don't be angry! I wanted to call, but the police are at the club. The inspector's keeping me busy. Nothing a pretty woman need worry about. Let's meet after my rehearsal. -At your place? -No. I'm engaged, remember! -What about Rue des Martyrs? -Don't be silly! -Not the Eiffel Tower? -Good idea. I'll be there in two hours. Bye, sweetheart. -It was the little Lefèvre girl. -Ah, women! The only photo I have with me. She's changed a bit now. Her mother was a dancer. She left when Brigitte was three. I've kept her well away from the world of music hall. She thinks I'm a shipping magnate. When she knows the truth… It will sort itself out. I fear it may not. The culprit must know I was arrested for gold-smuggling under the Occupation. So if anything went wrong, I'd be the suspect. He may have fabricated evidence. A Japanese camera. Very good equipment and not too expensive. Really, you're too kind. -He wants you to take a photo. -Oh, yes. Ready? Don't move… Smile! There you are. Thank you. You can prove your innocence. But there'll be a scandal. Brigitte will be thrown out of school. The police will question her. I can't let that happen. -What will you do? -Go to Switzerland. I'll contact a man I know in Lausanne. He's a crook, but he may be able to find out who's behind all this. They want our picture now. We can hardly say no. Ah, ah, yes, yes. -And if they find Brigitte? -They mustn't. -She'll find out sooner or later. -Later. And not from the police. She's still a baby. -Jean, will you do me a big favor? -Of course. Brigitte is in the studio with her friends. The dear girls are rehearsing their Greek dance for the charity ball. -I hoped my niece would be ready. -She was determined to rehearse. She's passionate about dance. -It runs in the family. -Sorry? -Our father invented the tango. -How adorable! In that case, you should watch them rehearse. -They're charming. -I'm in rather a hurry. Just a few minutes. Prince Igor Igorovich Gurinsky, the Marquis de Ste Foie. -Most honored. -Delighted. -She's grown into a big girl! -What's the old fool on about? -Mlle Delue. Mind your language! -He was pawing me. She's rather bright, but very sweet. Well, Brigitte… Won't you kiss your uncle? She won't remember. She was in her birthday suit when I saw her last, 15 years ago. He's an old goat! Come along, Brigitte. -My compliments… -No, Marquis. I want your opinion of our Greek dance. Igor, please continue. One, two… -The headmistress. It's urgent. -Come in. -Enchanting! My compliments… -You haven't seen the best part yet. Show us that lovely circle movement, the prayer of Thetis. Yes, ma'am. Places, please! One, two… You'll have to excuse me. Don't go. I'll be back in a minute. -Musical arrangement by me. -Excellent. Impossible to judge. Piano rubbish. Do you have a pupil named… -Brigitte Latour. -Yes. -Someone may try to contact her… -Her uncle is here. Where is he? He's a wanted man. -He'll stop at nothing. -He may be armed. Yes. Madame! Where is he? -There! -This way! You should knock before entering! -Don't worry, girls. -Out, or I call the headmistress. One, two, three… Out, I said, by Saint Nicholas! -Look out! -Don't be scared, girls. I am Prince Igor Igorovich Gurinsky! Stop! You're making a mistake. He's the killer! Come on, don't be scared. -What's going on? -Your dad's in Switzerland. He told me by phone. But why the police? -No idea. -So it's just as I thought. -What? -Daddy's in the Secret Service. He sent you to get me, but they found out. They sent fake cops to stop us. Come on, that door will break. -My clothes! -Where are they? The changing rooms. Follow me! -It's impossible, Sergeant. -Impossible is not Russian. -What's that noise? -Look out! They're coming! In here… Sorry, Miss. In here! -There he is! -No! Forget your clothes. Take me to the garden. I left my car behind the wall. Go on. -I'll go this time, boss. -Go on. Stand back! They killed him! -Can I sit up now? -Not till we're through the village. -You look like Jean Clary. -That's me. Fantastic! Kidnapped in the moonlight by a singing star. A dream come true. -Are you romantic? -No more than most. But it's enough to make anyone fall in love. You're not kidding. You look worried. What are you thinking? -My doctor and Jérôme. -Never heard of them. -It won't be easy. -My bum! -Sorry? -I've got a sore bum. You can sit up now. -Where are we going? -My place. We can't cross the border. You're half naked, with no papers, and hunted by a pack of ruthless spies. Don't make any noise. You should sleep now. I'll explain to Jérôme later. -Up already, Jérôme? -It's 7:30, sir. I was visiting my aunt. She's in hospital for an operation. Is that where sir found this striptease artist? -She's a young lady. -Her attire suggests she's very young. With your Hawaiian dancer's costume, you can hardly comment. -She's a relation, sir? -No, I found her. -She should return to her parents. -She doesn't know who they are. -An orphan? -She has amnesia. -She knows nothing about herself. -You should take her to the police. -I found her in Rue Pigalle. -She's from a circus? -Don't be rude! -Quiet! -In 24 hours, it will all be over. -I hope so. Prepare my room. She needs to sleep. -And you, sir? -I'll take an armchair in here. I'm reluctant to put this person in sir's bed. It's unhealthy. She may have fleas. -Hey! Grubby-face! -Prepare the room, Jérôme. Hawaiian dancer, maybe. But grubby? Never! She will apologize. -That's a good start. -The word flea always makes me itch. Menservants like Jérôme are a dying breed nowadays. Good! He's worked for the Duke of Windsor and the Duchess of Kent. -No reason to say I've got fleas. -He said you might, that's all. His mother is a companion to the Queen of Sweden, you know. Try to be nice. Tell him you're sorry. I will, for you. Miss may go up. The pajamas are on the bed. I'm sorry. Should I get down on my knees? No, get to bed. We mustn't forget to buy her some dresses. Waist 19 inches, chest 36, shoe size 4. -You'll remember, won't you? -Yes, sir. -Hello? Yes… -It'll take all morning, sir. -Yes, that's me. -You won't mind eating at 3 p.m.? I won't be here. Yes, I'm here. -I'm rehearsing. -I need stockings and suspenders. And a nightdress. -A nightdress? -The inquiry may take time. Let's hope the police do their job. Hello? Is that you, Paul? It didn't work. Yes, she's here. I got there too late. They were on our trail. Did your friend know anything? Who? Milord? Doesn't ring a bell. It's an interesting lead. Absolutely adorable. Good luck, Paul. -Was that Daddy? -He told me to kiss you. -Is he coming? -Once he's got a passport. -Will the spies come here? -Unlikely. -You never know. -We'll shoot them. Go to bed. I told your father you were very good. -Good night. -Good night. If anything happens, just call to me for help. OK. Good morning, Mr. Clary. Sorry to wake you. -Theatre folk aren't early risers. -I was doing my exercise routine. Yes. -You're alone? -Yes. Yes. -What I mean is… Can we talk? -Yes. You're engaged and I wouldn't like to disturb a lover's tryst. -I know what it's like. -My fiancée's not here. -Do you know a man named Milord? -I've never heard of him. The documents found at the Mississippi yesterday, which we have studied, include several letters addressed to a certain Milord. -I'm sorry. The smoke bothers you? -My vocal chords. Vocal chords… I see… Thank you. I am certain that this Milord is involved with the rest of the gang. The maid is running my bath. I'll tell her to stop. It'll only take a second. No news from Paul Latour? -No. -No. You never heard anyone call him "Milord"? -No. -No again. Think hard, Mr. Clary. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Go away, go away Don't ruin my life Go away, go away Don't ruin… When I get an idea for a song, you know… It's not bad. Very rhythmic. Slightly too high for me. Where shall I put the clothes, sir? On the stairs. I don't know this Milord, Inspector. The inspector has come to take that girl off our hands? Ignore him. My valet is very good but he drinks. I'll leave you now. If you think of anything, be sure to get in touch. -I will. -Call my office. -Direct line Laborde 12,34. -Thanks. -Easy to remember. 1, 2, 3, 4. -That's right. Sorry. My hat. -Blast! -The maid. Why shouldn't you have some fun? After all, you're not married yet. No, I'm not. Goodbye, Inspector. Goodbye, my dear Mr. Clary. -See you soon. -I hope so. Who was that? I didn't understand you. -A policeman. -A fake? -A real one. -Thank heavens for that. -Jérôme. -Yes, sir. Lay out my tuxedo. I'm dining with the doctor. -Well, sir. -My bath! My parquet! -Can't you be more careful? -I'm sorry! Does sir think I'll have time to scour the fashion houses, mop up floods, feed the amnesiacs that sir has brought home… and iron his shirt? I can do that. As the Queen of Sweden says to my mother, "Each to his own, and leave well alone." She can help you. Well then, I'm off to Mississippi. I'm late for rehearsal at the club. Don't let her out. The police said to take care of her. -On top of everything! -I'd like to be useful. -Tell me what to do. -Very well. We'll see. Two pounds of rump steak. -Poker game still on? -Yes, sir's out with the doc. Thanks, Doc! I'll be back with Ernest and Mimile. -OK. -Hello, Mrs. Pâquerette. Evening, gorgeous! I came to say hello on my way home. That's nice but I'm rather busy. Why don't you come tomorrow? Aren't you going to kiss me, naughty boy? Don't make that face, son. Mother, I've told you not to call me that here. -Your boss isn't here. -Yes, but… You have a very charming son. Send my regards to the Queen of Sweden, the dear old thing. -You've a sweet face, Miss. -Your son doesn't think so. -You wouldn't hurt my boy? -Not at all. I confess that the Duke of Kent, the Duchess of Windsor, the Queen of Sweden, it was to make me seem… -You understand. -Don't make him lose his job! Such a position. What would happen to me? If sir knew the truth, he'd be so disappointed. Faster! Faster! Faster! What a racket! Stop! When I stop singing, they should copy my moves. I'll show them. Watch me. -They questioned Emile all night. -And? Nothing. Will you be ready? -We open tomorrow? -Of course. OK. From the top. Places, please. Hello, Jérôme. It's me. I'll be later than I thought. If the doctor calls, I'll be round at 9 p.m. Very good, sir. How is Miss Pigalle? Very well. -She ironed my shirt? -Yes, sir. -The pleats? -I'm not sure. -It's not scorched? -Not scorched, sir, burnt. -Tell me the truth. What happened? -A silly mistake. The iron burnt the shirt and the ironing board. -So? -It burnt the Turkish rug. The flames spread to the chair on which your tuxedo was hanging. How is my tuxedo? -Burnt to a crisp. -And now? Everything's fine now, sir. They've arrived. -Who? -The firemen, sir. -Ought I to offer them something? -I'm on my way. His house must be on fire! -I'm in trouble now! -I had to let him know. You're right. He would have noticed anyway. Probably. Would you care for a drink? -We're not on the water-wagon! -It's the least we can do. Thank you again. Ciao. Jérôme! -Jérôme! -You called, sir? -You're an ass! -Sir is losing his temper. An ass, I said. I'll dock your wages. When we ran aground in the Gulf with the Duke of Windsor, the duke did not deduct the price of his yacht from my salary. -Excuse me. -It was my fault. I'm so silly, I'm sorry. Don't cry. Everyone makes mistakes. -We shan't talk of it again. -We must! What I did was dreadful! Dreadful! Hi, Doc! We're here for the poker. The boss is still here. You're so kind. And all I do to thank you is burn down your house! Those curtains were horrible anyway. New ones will look much better. And your tuxedo! I've ruined your evening. -It would have been a chore. -You're just saying that. I swear that's not true. I was invited to dinner by some very snobby, boring people. A bit like this: "Darling, such a pity we didn't see you yesterday." -So? -I'll see what's going on. "Let's see… Your Excellency, still keeping busy?" "My friend, I'm 85, I have three mistresses and all of my marbles!" Well? Things aren't too good. "Who's that enchanting young lady? Good enough to eat!" I don't know… Maybe it's Cinderella. -I've never seen you before. -Never? -Why aren't you dancing? -I have to leave the ball at midnight. We still have five minutes. You can tell me. You're Cinderella. No, I'm a pirate's daughter! This is no place for a pirate girl. I need a man to end my seafaring. -You've found one? -They're too scared. -Of you? -They think I'm cruel. But on my father's ship, after the pillage, I always kiss those about to die. I think I'm going. My heart is failing. You're lying, sir. Your heart is healthy. Tip tap, tip tap. -What time is it? -One more minute. It's almost over. A young man had to take my hand, kiss me and say the magic word. -Before the final stroke of midnight? -Yes. Midnight. Farewell, sir. Hello? Yes, I had a few problems, Doctor. My house was on fire. Why call you Doctor? I don't know. My house was on fire, but I'm not making a meal out of it. I said "a meal". Strange? It's not strange. We won't go to Loulou's. Don't be cross. I'm coming. -Jérôme, lay out a dark suit. -Right away, sir. Sir should know I invited a few friends round. OK. -Who's the doctor? -My fiancée. -What's she like? -Her photo is on the table. Oh, that's her. She's pretty. She must be intelligent. It's rare to find a woman with both qualities. I'm a real dunce. I passed my O-levels at 17, but I cheated in the written paper and made eyes at the oral examiner. Lili, how old were you when you passed your O-levels? Fifteen. -Did you make eyes at the examiner? -What do you take me for? -I wanted to know if it was usual. -It's not recommended practice. You're right. -You'd sleep better at home. -Not really. -Don't be rude. -That's not what I meant. My house is impossible. It's a disaster zone. In that case, you can sleep here. You're not scared of me? When I'm in your arms, I'm on fire. -Oh, no. -What's the matter? -You used a sensitive word. -You're impossible tonight. Let's eat. It'll do you good. Good idea. I'm starving. Where shall we go? I heard about a charming little place. It's called The Pirate. -What is it now? -Did you say "pirate"? -Can't I say "pirate"? -Yes, you can. -But why did you say it? -Because I did. What does it mean? Nothing. Right, let's go. -I want to play too. -Poker is a difficult game. -I know how to play. -If sir knew that… He'd rather know that than some other things. No matter. Jérôme, lend me 1,000 francs. -Straight beats three-of-a-kind? -Yes. -Blind bets allowed? -Yes. Maximum bet 1,500. I'm going to make you suffer! Nothing left? Cleaned out, and yet… 100 plus 50. -Plus 200. -And 100. And 50. -Your stack. -OK, I'm out. -It was a bluff. -You should have called it. -Can you lend me another 1,000 francs? -Of course. -The orchestra was first class. -You dance like an angel. -What is it? -Just a premonition. You and your catastrophes and premonitions. -Leave it. -It may be for me. -It doesn't matter. -Hello? It's me, Jérôme. One second. -I was right. -Back in a minute. Yes. -What's happened now? -It's Miss, sir. She's in jail. -Are the police looking for me too? -No one asked me where you were. I'm telling you as quickly as I can. As they were leaving, my friends were rather rude to some policemen. Miss went to their defense and called the police some names she shouldn't have. God knows what they're doing to her. The police station phoned to check if she was really your sister. It was rather… Sir must understand I have to start at the beginning! Yes, I replied that sir was indeed Miss's brother. It must be awful for her. I won't lose a second. -What was all that about? -What? Who? My aunt Renée. You've never mentioned her. What's happened? -She's having a gall bladder removed. -Poor woman. Relax, darling. Don't think about it. We're so happy together. Lili. How can I be happy while they're removing my aunt's gall bladder? What do you take me for? -Where are you going? -To the hospital! Get 'em off! -I'll wring its neck! -You can't, you coward! Leave it. We'll send it to the pound. Shut up in there! I'm Jean Clary. I've come for my sister. -About time! -Your papers, please. We know you, of course. It's a formality. I don't want that parrot to go to the pound. I'll find his owner myself. -Good riddance! -Come on, Jacquot. -Lucky for her she's your sister. -Thanks. Next time, she could end up in court. -That'll teach her. -Brute! -What's that? -A stray parrot. I'm taking him. -Out of the question. -I won't go without him. Come on. Gentlemen… -Bye! I'll try to invite you over. -Goodbye! -Bye! -See you soon! I'm sorry I slapped you. I was very angry. -Don't make excuses. -I feel bad. You'll get a sausage! -What's that? -A stray parrot. -With amnesia? -I don't know. Sir shouldn't get into the habit of bringing home strays. -You shouldn't have let her out. -Sir should hire a nanny. Don't worry. She'll be gone soon. -Where will she go? -I don't know. -Poor child. -She's rather lively. -But she's a good girl. -Heart of gold. I agree. She improves on further acquaintance. -Yes. -Yes. Call me when you want breakfast, sir. Thanks, Jérôme. I will. -Jean, I think-- -No… -Don't play that game. -I'm not playing. -Jean… -Be quiet. Go to bed. -Why did you come downstairs? -Why did you kiss me? I've been silly for the last two days. -Are you in love? -Yes. With my fiancée. Your eyes don't lie. Go to your room and stay there until your father arrives. Jérôme, breakfast! -I was afraid you'd be at the hospital. -I've just got back. -Your aunt? -Out of danger. -I'm glad. The mysterious fire! -Your breakfast, sir. -The cup is for the lady. -Good idea. Doctor, I didn't see you there. So why the second cup? -By chance. -By chance for which lady? -Well… -My little sister. Your aunt, your sister. You kept your family hidden. I've spoken of her often, darling. Look, here's her photo. She's still a child. She's unhappy. Father beats her. -Your cup. -Poor girl. -Shouldn't she have breakfast? -She's sleeping. Jérôme heard your voice and thought it was hers. Toast? My little… sister. Doctor Rocher Viledieu. -Delighted to meet you. -Thank you. I brought you a mattress. -I wasn't planning to sleep. -I see. -Now go to bed. -Why? You're not sleeping. I'm not a little girl. How old is she? Thirteen, but I'm very advanced for my age. -Now go back to bed. -Carry me. -Don't be silly. -Carry her if she wants you to. -Bye, Doctor! -She's lovely. She's a big baby. -You'll pay for this! -I love you. Do you take me for an idiot? Your little sister? -She's the eldest. -I'm telling you calmly. You've gone too far. Don't try to see me. -Let me explain. Lili! -Let me go! -Listen to me. She's not my sister. -You admit it. She's Paul Latour's daughter. No one must know she's here. -Tell me the truth. The fire? -Her. -Your aunt's gall bladder? -Her. Please don't tell anyone. Are you in love with her? -That detestable child? -Answer me. Lili, that's very hurtful. Get 'em off! -What's that? -A little parrot. You'll get a sausage! -I can't stay here a minute longer. -Jérôme! Phone France Soir. Place an advert offering a reward for the owner of the parrot. -Make sure it's published today. -Yes, sir. -Will sir lunch here? -It's the show's first night. -Then you have my best wishes. -Sorry? -You know. Good luck. -Thank you. And don't let the girl out! -No rehearsal? -Not before a first night. -We'll go to the faculty. -Why? A conference. You might learn something. You think so? It's you and me now. That horrible woman! Damn her! Too bad! This science has a particular place in the history of psychoanalysis. As Aristotle said, dreams are the work of the soul whilst we sleep. Why do we dream? Firstly, the subject needs to sleep; secondly, the subconscious wishes to express itself; thirdly, separation from the external world. We should not hesitate… …repression, and blocking it out enables us to… Have you heard of a man named Milord? The symbol of the wedding ceremony offers another example. In the Bedouin tribes, the bride wears a veil known as an "aba", under which she is completely naked… It enables latent thoughts to be expressed in images and visual scenes… Thanks to the dream process, the product of this action is revealed in a harmless, hallucinatory phenomenon, thus enabling… sleep to continue. -Rémy! Good to see you. -Any news on Latour? -He's vanished. -Blast. -Is your prisoner still silent? -As the grave. Talking of which, how was the funeral? -Fine. Very successful. -Very good. I met an old army friend I hadn't seen for 15 years. We had lunch in an excellent little bistro opposite the cemetery. I thought of you. We had coq au vin and all the trimmings for 500 francs. -Really? For 500 francs? -For the whole menu. -Generous helpings. -Really? -Really. -I always go to Rue Balard. They've a lovely white wine from Alsace. -Oh, yes? -Not expensive. -It's not expensive? -About 180 or 190 francs a bottle. Not expensive. What is it? -The photograph you asked for. -Yeah. If I can find Latour's daughter, it will be simple to find the father. -Well, yes. -That’s it. -Which one is she? -Third from the left. -I don't believe it. -What? I've seen that girl… Where could I have…? Heavens above, where did I see her? He'll remember, you'll see. He has such a good memory. He's a walking filing cabinet, that man. Where is it? Where could I have seen that girl? Sorry, Miss. He could have invited me. I'm dying to see him on stage. It's that awful woman's fault. He's like a child when she's around. He doesn't love her, it's obvious. She's… -The ladder! -Hold on! -Would Miss be so kind… -Here it is! -Whoever made this ladder…! -Quick! -He should be sent to jail! -Hurry! I no longer need it. OWNER OF PARROT LOST YESTERDAY, PLEASE CONTACT MR. CLARY Come in. -What's up, Milord? -This. "Owner of parrot lost yesterday, please contact Mr Clary, 16 rue de l'Étable." -It looks like the signal. -Of course. -But why did Clary place the ad? -Coincidence? No. Latour must have told him to place it. -A dirty trick. -And how! If they take the forged notes to Clary, we've had it! -How did he know about the ads? -No idea. But if one of you squawked, you can book your place at the morgue. -I feel great. -You slept all day. -Hello, Louis. -Evening, Clary. -My compliments. -Come to my table later. Until tonight, then. Sorry… Careful! It took me an hour to get it open. Sorry… -So what do we do now? -Tell them not to go to Clary's. Idiot! If I could contact them, I wouldn't put ads in the paper! -Maybe. -Dédé and Curly, it's up to you. Clary doesn't know either of you, so watch his house and intercept the guy with the dough. It's usually in a small brown case. Be quick about it. He's nuts and could wreck it. -Have found parrot. Stop. -I'm sorry? -Have found parrot. Stop. -Sir's come about the ad. Come in. -The parrot, Miss. -Have found parrot. Stop. -He doesn't say anything else. -You can leave us now, friend. Leave us. -You'll get a sausage! -You've got a parrot. Very clever. Of course I have a parrot. That's why you're here. You're right not to trust me. People are too trusting these days. -I could be a policeman. -What? Joke. You're only young but you've a great future. -You think so? -You're something of a Mata Hari. -You're… -Why do you say that? Because I can size up a man at first glance. Milord was right to change the rendezvous, after what happened last time. Tell him everything's fine our end. Little Mata Hari. Goodbye, now. There we go. Aren't you taking the parrot? But he's not mine, you know. He belongs to Milord! Quite a little Mata Hari! Mata Hari. My feelings exactly. He forgot his suitcase. He'll come back for it. That's rather strange. Hello? He's at the Mississippi. Yes, it's me! I've got so many things to tell you, Daddy! I'm very well. How are you? Where are you? You'll be here in an hour? Tonight? Why? OK, I'll be ready. Yes, Daddy. Miss has regained her memory? -My father's taking me home. -So everything worked out fine! I don't think so. That madman must have come back for his suitcase. Look! That must be it. No point hanging around. The cops could be back. Jérôme! -Have they killed you? -I fear so, Miss. The duke always said I had a thick skull… Not with me, Jérôme. Sorry, I hardly know where I am. Help! The police! Call the police! -No, not the police! -What are you doing? It's a top-secret spy operation. Jean will tell us what to do. -Why the note? -To tell Daddy we're at the club. -We'll leave the key in the door. -OK. The suitcase. OFFICE I have an idea. Well? The spies who hit you. If we could hear… They'll be talking about this and that. Let's go. Wait. OK, you can forget the suitcase now. You did a good job but it's not over yet. -I want to know how Clary is involved. -We can ask him. -Curly always gets answers. -Fine. -Find out exactly what's going on. -Shall we do it now? He'll be off stage in 15 minutes. -Take him out the side door. -I'll get the car. -Take him to the villa. Keep me posted. -Child's play, Milord. Don't waste any time. I'm going out front. I'm going to call the police. -Then I'll tell Jean everything. -No, no. -I could call my friends as back-up. -Good idea. Jean! No one's allowed backstage. Move, quickly. -Come to the Mississippi right away. -What? You have to help me and Miss. -You can count on me. I'll call Jojo. -OK. Carnot 1319… -Hello, Jojo? -Pépé? -…to the Mississippi? -Miss needs you. -As soon as you can. -…to the Mississippi. -I can't go dressed like this… -Listen to me… -…a minute to change your shirt… -Hello, Mother… -Are you coming or not? -What? -In Pigalle… What? -What do you want? -Not outside, inside… -What for? -Did you spend the day with Jean? -He's behaving rather oddly. -What do you mean? -He's agitated, nervous… -But… -Odd, that's the word. -But… -Really! -What's wrong? -That girl was at his house. -You know what he told me? -What? She's Paul Latour's daughter, and she's hiding at his place. -I believed him! -Latour's daughter? -He'll be sorry. -Excuse me. -You're crazy. -Your enemies are going to kidnap you. -And take me to your pirate ship? -They came to the house. Look! -That's Louis, the manager. -No, it's Milord. -Are you sure? -That's what they call him. Get the girl, too. She's Paul Latour's daughter. They'll come off now. It's over. -We can go out by the front. -Look. -We'll have to force them off. -How? Send on the next act. I remember! I saw her at Jean Clary's place. -In a bath towel. Very pretty. -Let's go! I knew he'd remember. He has a phenomenal memory. Believe me, she's a sight for sore eyes! We've got to get them off! Brigitte? Brigitte! -You're in a hurry. -I know you. -It's Paul Latour. -Got you! -I've a lot to tell you. -Out of the question. -Let him speak. -My daughter is in danger. Now they've had it. What shall we do? What's happening? Help! -Jean, where are you? -Over here! Hands up, against the wall. Finish your number later. Listen… -Not now. -It's now or never. -Are you in love with that girl? -Not now, for God's sake! -Answer me! -Call the police! You're trying to get rid of me. Do you love her? Yes! You beast! Goodbye. Jean… Brigitte! -Get up! Quick! -Did I hurt you? I don't know, but we're in a fine pickle. This is far too dangerous. Wait… We'll do this properly. When I say, you hit him. Now! Oops. You! Courage, sir! Here we are! Get the girl. Jean! Help! When I say, you pull. Ready… -Oops. -Sorry, Jean, sorry! I'm sorry, Jean! Look out! Get Clary! What a state you're in, sir. I should have called the police but I was a coward. -What? -I was afraid Miss would tell. -Tell what? -Well, you see, sir… Let me out! -You never served the duchess? -Oh yes, sir, once. On the boat between Dieppe and Newhaven. Excuse me. I brought her a glass of water. I was a cabin-boy. -Jérôme… You're fired. -It's what I deserve. Jean! Help me! Help! -The Japanese from the Eiffel Tower! -Excuse me. So this is the photo… Bravo! Jean! -Brigitte. -Daddy! So now you know everything? -You're a secret agent. -No, I have to disappoint you. I'm the owner of the Mississippi. -Well, Milord. We get the last word. -He'll have time to think. Let me out! Open up! I think Jean has something to ask you. Ghastly. It was ghastly. I heard people shouting and banging but I couldn't see a thing. Paul! I didn't expect to find you here. -Is this your daughter? -Yes indeed, Doctor. I'm sorry, I should have believed you. Seeing her on stage was a shock. I almost broke off our engagement. But you mustn't hold it against me. -You're the image of your daddy. -Come to me. Come! -Mr. Gérard's milk. -No, Jean. During the first attachment phase, the mother must feed the child. I’ve already told you. Darling, it seems I'm not allowed to give him his milk. He's sensitive. If he cries in the dark, don't worry. I worried it was bad for him. Don't let him sleep with the light on. I'll remember. Thanks for coming. What would we do without you? Brigitte is a wonderful mother. You're right. The big baby has become a perfect housewife. THE END
