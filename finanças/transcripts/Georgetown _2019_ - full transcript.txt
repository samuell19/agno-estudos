It's your first time? Yes and yours? I am already a veteran. I attended two dinners and a cocktail. Y? It is hard to describe. They are always memorable. Eleanor Price. I come from Reuters. Ted Parsons. Well, why do not you say so before? - Congratulations. - Ditto. Thank you. It's an important night for you. - No thanks. - It is. Sure you're happy. Rather relieved. And grateful. As it did? I have not the foggiest idea. What Mott know? Ulrich knows all Georgetown. A person indispensable in the embassy. No, the word is not indispensable. It is impossible to ignore. It's like Lawrence of Arabia with a Blackberry. The last time I was here, I sat at the side of Scalia. Officiated the wedding itself, what do you think? Do you know his wife? -I did not know you were married. -Of course he's married. This house is hers. - Where is Elsa? - I'm glad to see you. I sent the invitation of the Department of Defense. I do not know anything. What do you work on? I do not know. In the apparently works miracles. I've only seen a couple of times. Have you heard what Iraq? No. We sent reports from there over two years. And that's not asked. In life he had seen such a thing. At the end I was forced to say: "You are crazy. Meteos plan that stupid ass." Always diplomatically, of course. I said, "Ulrich, can not speak well to the director of the German intelligence." And I said, "because I just did." It is normal. If we have to place a microphone in a hotel room or someone's car, no problem. But in the bath Madeleine Albright? Please... What a stupidity. Of course. Then I went home and went to bed. At the next day I called to make an offer. What did they say? Ah, yes, I could not refuse. And what happened? When you go home from Madeleine Albright I'd better not say anything important in your bathroom. - Please go ahead. - Thank you. Oh I'm sorry. I did not want to scare you. You have not done it. Usually it takes a nap before dinner. He came to wake her. Forgives. He could have hired an caterers, but prefers to do everything himself. Sorry join the party so late. Hi. -Ulrich promised to wake me before. -It's her? Yes. I needed rest, dear. This man consents me too. You know I hate to miss the cocktail. Well, you're forgiven. Sure you get get a day away. Well, before you say anything else... Ulrich and his wonderful achievement. Nerd. I was just one more player within a game very complicated. It really is... Sorry, I'm trying to make a toast. Forgives. By a woman and her freedom. And by all who have come to celebrate with us. - Health. - Health. It is hot. I'm so hungry. - Let's start with the soup. - Yes. Yes it's correct, They arrested one of our employees in Iran. A wonderful woman, married with a daughter in the nursery. We had been several days without knowing anything about it. They had been arrested and were arrested for espionage. Was spy? No, we dedicated ourselves to collect data. He was an economist. It was a lie. However, the government did not respond to us. You were all too busy with the affairs of Iraq. We could not communicate with anyone. We were virtually alone. Without any contact. And meanwhile... Thank you, Mott. Meanwhile, the poor woman He was locked in a cell Teran. Soon after, a friend of mine, a former ambassador, He introduced me to our illustrious host. For God's sake, Ted. I'm a second, and you're embarrassing me. No, Ulrich. Let me tell the story. We were introduced and then told me he would take care. No no no no. I said I would do what he could. - Y? - Y... Released 10 days later. All thanks to him. - Mott got it. - How? Still she not told me. A magician never reveals his tricks. Come on. - Please. - Nerd. Stop. Stop. Please sentaos. What? I hope you are good. I can not. I can not keep listening to this. In the middle of dinner? I do not care dinner. I not even know there was a dinner. I came to see you, mother. I said you wanted to let us pass time together. No longer we do anything together. When I come, it only matters, their celebrations and their pathetic stories. He has done something exceptional. Yeah right. Well let me know when you win the Nobel Prize. -See you in Stockholm. -Do not be childish. After all you've been through, you're leaving here alive. He's my husband. It's our house. Yes, I know I know. Please, I want to know. Trying to punish me. Â¿Castigarte? Look, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I will move to Washington. I have no problem. I will give classes here. Or you could come to Boston. I'll do anything to help you if you stop doing this, please. You do not understand. Go if you want to be with us. Can not you do this morning? Yeah right. But I'd rather do it now. You stay up until two o'clock and you wake me when you upload. Sorry to disturb your sleep for wanting to pick up after our party. Our party? As if I'd let choice. That's Amanda, right? She has put you in a bad mood. I do not know why you keep inviting the bitter bitch. Do not talk about my daughter. And do not you dare smoke in my house. What will this guy? I have no idea. Go crazy. Mola your beret, man. Say it? It was good. He ate well. He seemed to be enjoying. When was the last time you talked to her? Before I left home last night. What time was that? She went to bed and I went for a walk after midnight. How much do. Does not like... fumase did not like at home. At the back, I found her on the landing of the staircase. Was that when he called emergency? Yes. I called immediately. I have the hope of... How old was his wife, Mr. Mott? 91 years. Now we have to be brave. I know that you left after arguing with her. I'm sorry. That does not matter anymore. You want to talk about the organization? I would like to be buried in Arlington. I want to be buried with my father. I think Arlington would be the most appropriate place for it. Why? While I understand perfectly what you tell me. There are other issues. We need to talk over the house, the will and property. They are already dealing with that. I'll be in touch with you soon. And we mourn and remember as they should. I promise. But now we have to do something very important. What? I have to find to the man who murdered your mother, my wife. Over here please. Come here. We're about to enter a sanctuary. The nerve center, a sacred place. This information is stored, the options are weighed and decisions are made. Decisions that affect our lives, both yours and mine. Even the fate of nations. Ah, no, I ask them not to make any photographs. A matter of national security. No, no, nothing happens. Do all the pictures they want. Where they are? - Akron. - Cincinnati. Come visit your congressman's office. A 50-year trainee should know that is not so. I owe it to my constituents, okay? I think that if they do see the importance of the work we do here, We will serve them much better. How long have you been in the United States, Ulrich? Just one year. But I have passed the university entrance and just accept me into the doctoral program. How good. But I begin to wonder If this job is best for you. Gordon, it's funny you say that. I could not agree more. I missed making guide or selling tickets for the Smithsonian. My true passion is the history of diplomacy. Kissinger, Bismarck, Talleyrand... Often genius. Talleyrand. Have you read something of yours? Anyway, I had happened I could write political speeches of Congressman. Could you discuss this issue with him during lunch? No. I was referring to this site. It may not be your place. Am I being laid off, Mr. Nichols? I encourage you to find a better where you develop all those talents work. - Gordon. - Dime. - Can we review the agenda? - Yes. Sorry. Nichols. Office of Congressman Guyer. I am your chief of staff. Will give something like not see me when they start speeches. - In agreement. - Thank you. Yes, exactly. So is. When I told him what happened, He left me absolutely surprised with your answer. Sorry. Yes? Go. Thank you. I guess it's Elsa Breht, journalist. Yes. I'm Ulrich Mott. It is an honor. His work is brilliant. Religiously read the newspaper Handelsblatt. Wow, really? Thank you. Work on Capitol Hill while I finish a doctorate in International Relations. We could be one day for lunch. Sure you could teach me many things. Thank you. To you. Sorry. Here's the car. Thank you. Can we meet again? Clear... Mr. Mott, you know I'm married. Yes and what? Well... thank you for this lunch so nice and have much luck. Let me know if your situation changes. What? I dont know. Nothing. It's lovely you. Not responding to my invitation. Before he saw her every week in the choir. But he has stopped going. Hello mother. Who has come? I hear voices. Katherine. Well, the rescue team. It takes weeks without knowing anything about you. You should not have brought. What you wanted to do? Â¿Sit there looking like that of listless? I'm not apathetic. Do not be ridiculous. I just do not want you to treat me like a baby. Nobody is trying you as a kid. - Just... - Hi, honey. Come on. We have an appointment to nail us. And then Brzezinski will speak at the National Press Club at 3. And then we have dinner at La Chumiere. Without question, dear. I have already made the reservation. Please, Mom. It has arrived. It has arrived. New Year and the new millennium. Many thought that this day will mark the end of the world. Say it? It is a historic day. - What? - you Are not watching TV? Attentive everyone. It is a historic day. Who? Ulrich Mott. We left after taking a schnitzel. Ve wheat, Ulrich. Mozart, Schuman... The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra at the Kennedy Center, on Wednesday night. They are all tickets sold, but I've done with two entrances. Do not ask me how, because I will not tell. Call me in an hour. Please welcome the new millennium. The future is here. Your mother never ceases to amaze. If only got half as good at her age she. Ditto. - May l? - Thank you. There is. Queen of the Society of Georgetown. Hello, how are you? Party seems to take one week. Care, Sally Quinn. What is your secret? If you find out, tell me. Your father was very glad to see her well. Heaven, I have to tell you something. - What? - Remember when... you told me I had to get me company? At that time I said no. I'm sorry. You were right. I also have to tell you something. I have given the square and Harvard. Great. Professor and respecting seniority. -They just make me the offer. -It is wonderful. Yes. They do not know how lucky they are. Is everything signed? Well, I have to... -No no no. -No, I wanted to talk to you. CÃ³gelo. There's nothing more to speak of. - Well... - It's wonderful. And maybe meet someone there, sky. Yeah, but it's not what I'm looking right now. I know things you have not done very well in this area. Mom, please. He had thought the same You could come with me. I know you have a lot of attachment to Georgetown, but it could help you much if you were there with me. Sweetie... I do not need help. But if you said you wanted... Here I have everything I need. - What? - Good afternoon friends. I want to announce something. Today this festival has a special reason. We do not want to give much hype, but we do want to share our happiness with you. Please raise your glasses with me to celebrate the good fortune I had to commit myself in the marriage with the extraordinary and wonderful Elsa Breht. - Congratulations! - Health. Since I when you know him? Lower your voice. I'll thank you not hablases as if it were a virginal teenager fresh out of a convent school. But if it could be my brother. Or you had no choice. Sure you have other suitors. They are old and boring. Mott is young and interesting. I think it has a lot of potential. In agreement. Can we now stop playing these things? I am, okay? You only daughter, Amanda. Do you know something about him? Amanda, I need your approval. I managed to survive the war. Got survive in this country and learn the language. I got to raise my daughter and have a profession. I think I will wonder marrying with a fascinating man, delivered and, yes, a little younger than me. Thank you. Thank you. I want you to leave my house. You go now. Mrs. Breht, let you explain. Detective, I teach constitutional law. So stop talking to me in a condescending manner. Explain to me why he let a possible suspect continue to live in a crime scene. This is not a criminal investigation. So far, we have only one woman more than 90 years died. I will question tomorrow morning. And what the coroner said the cause of death? Head trauma that fits with a fall down the stairs. That I do not know. No, we do not know. And so we will carry out a full autopsy. They only take a couple of days. Mr. Mott, I want to remind you again you can ask a lawyer. I'm aware of that, but I do not need a lawyer. Well. I wonder what happened after he found the body of his wife. I returned home hoping to find her asleep in her room. I did not imagine it was to see her before the next morning. So I was petrified when I saw there. - They slept in separate rooms? - Yes. Why? He was 91 years old, detective. Have you ever had conjugal relations a woman over 90 years? No. Well, me neither. Did you touch the body of his wife after finding her? Maybe, to touch her for a pulse or something. Can I say one more thing? Please. As you know, I left for a while just after my wife lie down. I was out for several hours. And where was it? For a walk. During several hours? I have little time to exercise during the day and after eating so much, I need to move. I have pretty clear that... It was at that time, between 11 and 2 am, when someone entered the house and killed my wife. Mr. Mott, the lock was not forced. That is normal. He does not believe? I do not understand you. No, I see no. You do not understand what you are facing. What do you mean, Mr. Mott? I can not believe I have to tell you this. People able to carry out such a crime It is too sophisticated to leave as useful clues to the police to find. Mr. Mott, you know what this is? It is a complaint. Exact. Filed a complaint that his wife against you for assault. Is there anything you want to tell us? This is an incident He held in New York a while ago. My wife and I started to argue. It is painful and I am ashamed to remember, but it was the typical discussion that has any married couple that takes a long time. That'd just made our marriage, although we had the good fortune to fix it after two years very complicated separated. Well... because this story since there is no evidence that an intruder entered... We need to open a murder investigation. I get it. Am I going to stop? Not right now. However, we have granted an order to close his house until the investigation continues. You can not go back there. And I ask you not to leave town. Soy Ulrich Mott. Can we see each other? It is urgent. Mr. Mott. Thanks for meeting me. You're welcome. Can we take a walk? We have heard about Elsa by the news. Sorry for your loss. I'm having a hard time and I think it can get worse. What does it mean? I hope they are just days away but... The report of the coroner arrives at 11. I give you more information then. Thank you. -They left this at reception. -Thank you. I assure you I have no desire to stay longer than necessary. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. He has made 250 thousand dollars. In addition to other 50K if liquid assets They exceed 600 thousand dollars. I understand that refers to the house, it must be worth... about one million. Even more. And that is also what is it? Yes. Do not worry, detective. We appreciate it. I see. Oh no. Communicated it now. In agreement. Many thanks. The coroner has determined that Elsa has wounds that fit with a non-accidental trauma. They have opened a murder investigation. Where is? -Excuse me, ma'am? -That bastard. He killed her. - Madam, please... - Do not touch me. Here is Mott. Do not tell me you're not? There is no one here. Do you have any idea where he might be? How do I know? It may be gone from the country. They should rescinding his passport. Hey, hey, hey. Do not move. - Ulrich Mott? - Yes. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against them. You have the right to an attorney. If you can not afford it, you will be assigned a public defender. Soon we go with the news of the day. Just get the mail. And here's my latest acquisition. It's the most ingenious I've ever seen. - Bye dear. - Goodbye. See you. Will we see you on Sunday at the Scowcroft? Go for the car. It's lovely. Truth? Have I done something wrong? Not everything is perfect. Thank you. You are the perfect butler. Is that what you want to be? You know not. And what are you waiting for? An opportunity. I try. Really? And I am that opportunity? You are my woman. Vladimir Petrovsky. It's a very good friend of mine. He was a diplomat in the Soviet era. Now she works at the United Nations in Geneva. Each creates opportunities. Mr. Petrovsky, I think we have a friend in common, Elsa Breht. Oh no. Sends memories. Of course, I will tell you. The motive of my call... is that... I was wondering... I wanted to know... Some time ago I quit my job on Capitol Hill. Directed study groups members of Congress. In international relations. Now I have my own company, an advisory firm in which I myself served as a consultant. We took two years running and we have customers with a similar profile to yours. People need to have a representative informal style Washington continuously. Yes. If there is a conference, a meeting or even a party that may interest but which can not go, we take care to be their eyes and ears in Washington, so to speak. Yes. Of course. It's amazing that no one has gone before him, yes. Ulrich Mott and Associates. I will give you my private number. No need to contact my secretary. Can I interrupt the conversation? - Of course. - Voucher. Ahead. Well. Good night. Ulrich Mott, representative Vladimir Petrovsky, United Nations in Geneva. Mr. Petrovsky them sends greetings and feel unable to be here today. If you please, I read his notes. Then I will answer all the questions they have. I should talk to my husband on that subject. In Mott and Associates They are dealing with those things. I'll leave my card. -Call me anytime. -Ulrich Mott and Associates. I do not like. Â¿International Symposia Solutions? Shorter, shorter. Global Solutions Group? Group of prominent people? No no no. Almost... Eminent Persons Group. Eminent Persons Group. Eminent Persons Group. FOUNDER PRESIDENT: ULRICH MOTT Yes, it's gorgeous. Look, here he comes. I'll start preparing it. What a beauty. It's a very intelligent young man. It is fortunate. I wish I had had a grandchild. Agency works in the Defense Threat Reduction. It is an excellent contact. It could be of much use. Well. Okay, begins preview of the US case contra Ulrich Gerald Mott... Your Honor, there are some problems that Mr. Mott would comment before the trial. What kind of problems? Mr. Mott did not give me details. I made it clear that it would comment only here and there before me. In agreement. Thank you, Your Honor. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. I would like to bring the following complaints. The United States has openly violated my rights under the Geneva Convention. I'm still an active member an army abroad and because of this, I am honoring my uniform and insignia, I have the right to address to me with my full range. Brigadier general Ulrich Mott. Excuse me, said Brigadier General? It is right. Where does the United States Army? No, Iraqi special forces. Because according to this drawback legal, I am obliged to inform the government. In agreement? Are you ready to go? Yes, Your Honor. Do you have any document to support it? The court will want to see. You mean a test of my rank? - Yes of course. No need to ask. I will provide it immediately. Mr. Mott, would have been helpful if we had said before about his military rank or whatever you call it. Tell me, Why should it matter to you my work? I have not asked them to represent me. And do not give very good impression that something as basic as my work the army has caught unawares. I participated in the international community for years thanks to the GPE. Does the GPE? Eminent Persons Group. My NGOs. A non-governmental organization. I understand. Is there anything else we should know and still you have not told us? Absolutely. I've always been a commendable person. I even went to the police when they said it was suspicious. I gave up with dignity when they came to my house to stop for a brutal and revolting crime. I did it because I am innocent. Why he left his house the night when his wife died? I went for a walk. Yes because? Why people out for a walk? To give me air. To do exercise. To smoke a cigar after spending all night sitting at the table. I have this habit. Do you want to continue? Mr. Mott, where did? I wandered around the neighborhood. And is there anyone who can corroborate? If you are able to find a passerby able to remember a man ordinary strolling, Yes, someone can confirm this. If not, I seem to you and the Supreme Court of Washington They have to accept that people go out for walks without further. That is our mission. Thank you. It is absolutely necessary we move on and that we include everyone. - Excuse me. - Prime Minister. Excuse me. Excuse me one second. What can I do for you? I was very impressed by everything you said. Especially its emphasis in the reform of the Security Council of the UN. You have all the reason, It is essential. Especially for those we care about non-proliferation. Thank you very much sir... Mott. Ulrich Mott. Work on the Eminent Persons Group. I'm sorry... Right now we are dedicated anti-terrorism matters. Maybe we could talk some issues on which we could work together. Maybe. Do you have any gap next week? Embassy brings me the agenda. I do not know if... Let me give you my card. Call the Embassy. Sorry. As I was saying... Yes. With Monsieur Michel Rocard, please. Ulrich Mott, of the Group of Eminent Persons. Ulrich Mott. Well, I'd like to talk about it personally Monsieur Ro... Yes, we are good friends. I asked him to call to arrange a lunch. Is there? It would be better if I could talk to him directly. Okay, I'll leave my number. Where did you live when you came to America? As was? Â¿Nebraska? The whole story. Coming here after the war. Your home ended up knackered and had to leave. It was exciting? Did you have fear? Both. You were an adventurous woman. When Tom left the army and I suggested that we mudÃ¡semos here, I thought he was crazy. This was very different from Bavaria. I liked. People... did not treat me as if I were German, either as an enemy or as a foreigner. Everyone was extremely friendly. That's what I like about America. Yes. It is a very small state on Nebraska, right? All its inhabitants fit in Georgetown. Â¿You knew everyone? We all had relationship. Ya. Â¿You knew Chuck Hagel, Senator? Â¿Elsa? I'm Chuck. How are you dear? It is a pleasure to hear from an old friend After so much time. It would be a pleasure to attend your party in honor of the French Prime Minister, of course. Great. I hope the caterers will match. Motti do not understand anything. Is the guest of honor will Senator Hagel or Rocard? Both of them. And they know that? Yes. Stop asking me questions now. Estate get dressed and ready in time. Otherwise I take care of myself. - Will you come Michel Rocard? - Yes. Hagel is the director of the Armed Services Committee. Will come. Still you are taking the dog? - Does the dog have? - Yes. He became very famous for the Oregon Trail. Our home is not always the place where we come from. Well, not everyone is suited to the climate. The winters are bitterly cold and the growing season is very short. My father grew corn. Seriously? I think we can go past. -Did I do the favor to pass? -Come on, sky. Please. Dear, you sit here. It's the best place. Excuse me. Amazing. It is the first thing that occurred to me. Have you cooked? Sorry, Not wearing a patch last time we met? A patch? Well, I'd say no, no. I think we should make a toast. The person to whom we honor, Elsa Breht. I know it's not what I promised, but I've noticed that we would not be here and enjoying dinner This wonderful evening was not for her. And that's the most important thing, do not you think? Health. Health. Sorry to interrupt. Are you a gentleman of refined taste. Thank you. Wonderful. As you know, only 110 of more than 190 members of the United Nations They have designated these agencies. And only about 30 They have established a mechanism for national change. And that's precisely where GPE comes in. To generate the progress we need. CO-PRESIDENT: Michel Rocard It's a very interesting presentation. And more coming from a friend of Michel. It will be a pleasure to help in anything in which it is involved. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mott. Or should I call Conde Albie? Did you use my assistant my family title? I told him not to. Not very democratic, is not it? I'll talk to him the subject. Thank you. Thank you. University of Michigan. A good center, but not the best. Very little experience. Contactless. You do not know anyone in the White House? Not even your father has friends on Capitol Hill? Good... just I moved from Michigan. You remind me of the young Ulrich Mott. You are hired. Michel Rocard and Ambassador Mason I was recommended to speak directly with Mr. Soros. I hope you do not mind, but I have taken the liberty to bring my own materials. I did not want to send them to any employee. I want you to take a look. So I said: "That alone would have worked at the time of Jackson". - Mr. McNamara? - Yes. We do not know eachother. Ulrich Mott, of the Group of Eminent Persons. Excuse me, but this is an extraordinary chance. This morning, Mr. Soros He recommended me to put me in touch with you. Do you have a second? Â¿George? Of course. Sit down. Board Members President Bush, We are at a historic moment that will mark... Now begins a new chapter for our countries, we would like to deem our home a second Embassy. A few years ago, when I stepped away from the service... Were you in the military? You are right. In the French Legion. But I'd rather not go into details. Better not. A fine, I was exhausted, really. Burned. But after I created the GPE. Not only the best cricket captain in the history of the sport... You know what cricket? He is also a member of parliament fucking Pakistan. Therefore we can not sit him to the side of the baths, dammit. The only thing I like is that. Diplomacy, he said Winston Churchill, is the art of telling people to go to hell so you ask for directions. With permission from the prime minister, I prefer to think What is the art to help people find the way to heaven. Does the Ponzi Scheme? One name the next, the next, and the next is removed. It seems very unfair. Ponzi stole money. He is ruining people. I gave lectures. I is true, started from below. And that? Is that a crime? It may be so in Washington. I had no companion at Yale no senator's son. I just went ahead. -What about Elsa? -What's wrong with her? The used. Your money, your contacts... I did not use to Elsa. How can you suggest such a thing? She gave me everything for love. He gave me the courage to believe in myself. She owe everything. Which it makes the accusation that has brought me here even more ridiculous. Mr. Mott, It was ever I violent with his wife? It was? Violent? No. Did I do things that I am ashamed and much? Of course. Think of a marriage where none have made a mistake. Think of a marriage unapologetic. The situation in Iraq is unacceptable for Americans. Our troops in Iraq have fought bravely. They have done everything we have asked them. We have made mistakes, but all the responsibility is mine. I consider the GPE is well positioned and could have an important role in rebuilding Iraq. Let me tell you first of all how grateful we are, Mr. Mott. You and your wife have organized wonderful events. -We really enjoyed... -Yeah, yeah, yeah... but it's time to go further. It's great to enjoy with friends at parties, but the time has come for action. I get it. And what kind of action has in mind? It's all detailed in this proposal, but mainly, the idea is to gather In one single place all enemies of the United States and liberate Iraq. The Taliban, El-Sadr to, to the army of El-Mahdi, jihadists... To all the world. We may be at a neutral site, such as Kurdistan. And there we organized peace conference most impressive of all. A kind of mediation. Assistance, guidance, whatever you call it. Thanks to the GPE. Thanks to you. You are right. As director of the GPE, I am oversee the process. I have sent an identical proposal to Kofi and... Sorry, the office of the UN Secretary General. We discuss the issue on Thursday. What are these medals? Sorry? Badges bearing. I not stop looking at them, but I'm afraid I do not recognize any. Good, are several honors accumulated over the years. Any is the French Foreign Legion? I remember he said he served there. No, they are something else. Ah. I see. Let us return to the issue at hand. Mr. Mott, I guess you already know that we do not want any relationship with the Taliban, the Sadrists, or other groups mentioned. In addition, an ambitious plan, if it is possible to carry it out, He would have to be supervised by the United States Department of State, the League of Arab States or the United Nations. Read the proposal, okay? Perhaps the French Foreign Legion to help us. Thanks for your time and concern. If you have any other ideas, please please let us know. Have our doors open. Mr. Mott, how has he gone? What did they say? I see receptive. I have hopes. Are we now to the office? No, you go. I'll take a fucking drink. Where have you been? Working. Liar. Reek of alcohol. And you reek of death. Â¿Motti? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They laughed at me today at the embassy. They've had a magnificent proposal and they have laughed at me. Is, Motti. Sometimes I think people laugh at me. The whole city, everyone. "Who does he think he is? A simple nobodies from nowhere ". "His parents were unsuccessful and he is not one. Just a joke with legs that laugh." Hey, Motti, I believe in you. I never laugh at you. PromÃ©temelo, please. I promise you. Elsa. And here we have the suite of the ambassador. Ah, no, no, no. We booked a regular room. So is. But I changed the reservation. I hope you do not mind. We deserve it. Is, Motti. What you are naughty. I'll call you after the meeting. Are you sure you're okay? - Of course. - A taxi. I came to New York and before you were born. Where you'll go? Bergdorf, Bendel's, Chanel... I have everything in six blocks. And then I take tea with a friend. - Behave well. - I shall return to 6. We do not ruin. Tell me honey. How about for Boston? Listen, I'm in New York and I just saw the perfect Chopard watch Ulrich. No no no no. Listen, listen, listen. He deserves it. It will give a conference at the United Nations on behalf of the GPE. I'm so proud of him. I thought you'd be shopping. And I'd be at the United Nations. I'm done. Who is this? A friend. Fuck, are you crazy? Your! How could you? Ungrateful. -Do not mount a show. -Why have you done this? Did you think it would be many years without sex? In my nostrils. Only you had to avoid me this, and I put it in my bed under my nose. There has been no meeting of the United Nations, right? How would there be? Who would I want to meet with you? Do not ever talk to me like. Liar. Liar. Liar. Everything you've told me are lies. I'm sorry. If I had said that his mother was staying here, I... The next time you could call mother. Come on, bitch. Do it. Outside. Outside. Go away. Worthlessness. You're just a liar prostitute, depraved and disgusting. Oh boy. You are going to take ages to get it all. Let 'me help you. -Or better, let's get your stuff. -What do you say? For now. For. The suite is in my name and you're no longer welcome here. You do not have any idea where he is? Did you have problems? Typical of any normal couple. And do not say that we were a very normal couple. No. I wish I knew where it is. Did you file a complaint the deceased, Mrs. Breht, in 2006 against Mr. Mott? Yes. He said the cast your hotel room aggressively. In addition, Mr. Mott threw a bowl of soup on top Mrs. Breht. - Protest. - If admits. Please forgive me. The report says I had soup in her hair and clothing. When the police arrived, Have you found a lady over 80 years outside your room with all your luggage? Yes. No more questions. Exhibit presented No. 4, the document was given the daughter of Mrs. Breht the day after finding it dead. Yes. According to the testament which have submitted, Did he win something? Yes. Between 250,000 and 300,000 US dollars, besides the house of Mrs. Breht. The test number 24, helpful and presented by the defense, confirms that Ulrich Mott Gero He was named brigadier general of the Iraqi army Nouri el-Maliki, Prime Minister and Defense Minister Iraqi. And this here confirms I have named the Sexiest Man of the world. Certifies Her Majesty the Queen of... Protest. England and has sent through... Protest. It was a fucking disaster. We have destroyed. He has been looking at doing nothing. Well, tell me what you think you should have done. He has assault charges. Already they have a probable cause. Is something that mortifies me and embarrasses me. That's why I left the country for two years. Why not let them tell you? Sure, and also how he ended up being Iraqi brigadier general. My credentials are totally authentic. Despite this bizarre staging. How have they been able to let it go that way? It is reason enough to declare a mistrial. He thinks someone murdered his wife, but you have no idea who. And let's not said where he was the night of the 11th. I have said a thousand times I went out for a walk fucking. Is not sufficient. I'm sorry. This sucks. Yes, indeed. Is right. The thing does not look good. If you have another theory about what happened, It should tell it. We're running out of options. I did not want to do this. It could jeopardize many innocent people. People should not be involved in this disgrace, but if you want to know my theory what happened, as you call it, I advise you to talk as soon as possible with Mr. David Weatherford. - Â¿Weatherford? - Weatherford. It is the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs of the State Department. I trust him fully. It has a number of materials, After analysis it properly, they will demonstrate Who is to blame for the death of Elsa. I warn you to be prepared. Result information, disturbing. And putting ourselves in the worst, It could cause geopolitical conflicts. Ask him for my statements. Ask him by Zarathushtra. Let's go there. Is he. - Â¿Weatherford? - Â¿It Volker? She is Durant, my companion. - Hi. - Hi. Have you read this? Yes. Y? You'll see. Say it? Say it? - Hello? - Hi Is Elsa? Motti. Motti, are you? Where are you? I'm busy. I do not think I go see in a long time. Yeah, but where are you? There is not much coverage. Anyway, I do not know if you want to know about me, but I'm doing the most exciting work, frightening and important thing I've done so far and I can not enjoy it without you. I miss you so much. I just wanted to tell you that. Yeah, yeah, okay. But where are you? And? Have you heard of such Ulrich Mott? Should not? - Yes, I think we should. - Why? Because it seems that he alone He is trying to stop the insurgents. "Urgent. Ulrich De Mott, Villa Zarathustra, Sadr City, Iraq. Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs alone. Not spread. 14 November 2006. Baghdad. I am one of the few that is contacting with the two leaders of the national insurgency, al-Sadr y Hakim. Also with the jihadist Abu-Ayeeb to el-Masri, leader of El-Qaeda ". This just arrived. He is the director of a small NGO. But he has on the board to Soros, Robert McNamara... It seems that you are working as a kind representative of Muqtada el-Sadr. Wait to? He says he intends to alienate the Madhi Army of violence to achieve a state of peace. "I am thinking in accepting the offer of on-Sadr enlist. I hope to reach a ceasefire. Ulrich ". Who the hell has authorized the enlistment a German army Madhi and given permission to negotiate on our behalf? No one. It seems that he is doing on its own initiative. Well, leave it, dammit. "December 7, 2006. Villa Zarathustra, Sadr City. Dear Mr. Secretary, thanks for the message of encouragement. Sorry I could not talk to you, But the brothers are very strict. Do not accept secular intrusions let alone during prayers." Is there no way to contact him? Are you running Mott this organization or not? It takes a while without getting in contact with me. All I know is that it is in the Middle East. If they give him, you can ask him when I get paid? You will not believe it. The weirdo-Sadr leads to the teeth. It does not fit very well and sometimes lisp. He meant the word "murderer" and he ended by saying "corned". When angered, they pass those things much. I'm working on me to leave two things clear. Must securely hold dentures and sign peace with the Americans. Though not necessarily in that order. Mrs. Breht, what her husband is doing is amazing. It seems that runs a diplomatic mission alone and on her own from an enemy nation. This is terribly counterproductive and dangerous. Moreover, it is an unprecedented act. Not understand how Could you make something happen. Ulrich do not know. "December 26 2007 Villa Zarathustra. As you know, I made a proposal to capture Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias. The memo sent it to Secretary General Annan in 2004. The document reached the Iraqi embassy. That was the basis of my mission in Iraq when I arrived in Baghdad in 2006. A mission that still work, although sometimes afraid not live to finish it." We have analyzed your mail from Iraq. I knew that David would help us. He is a good man. It is being played. They are classified documents. In fact, we wanted to ask you about that. You sent those messages. Why do not we handed them over to the beginning? It was a small test, Mr. Volker, He has passed with flying colors. A test since. He speaks several missions... Wait. A second, one second. You're not recording this, right? No, we just understand this. Very good. Continue. The missions carried out on behalf of el-Sadr... My friend, yes. He wrote that came to antagonize some of the insurgent factions, groups allied el-Qaeda in Iraq. Groups who did not want el-Sadr came to a peace agreement with the United States and they would have blamed to have reached. Yes. Okay, Mr Volker. He has done very well. Already he has his nose in the matter. Move on. Vale. Mr. Mott, Why do not we account directly who believes who murdered his wife? We are their lawyers and just we want to help. But you only presents conundrums. We have done a huge research and he tells us to follow up. We have spent hours studying these things. Oh boy. Do we have to go through all this again? Safety, classified information, disseminate only what is necessary... Do you think you've got all that releasing insider like that? God, you two are hopeless. I'm afraid I'll have to defend myself from now. Have a nice day. You will receive the order Greengrocery every week. - I have fix it. - Voucher. And if you want to change something, the number is in the kitchen. - Voucher. - I'll come back next month. I have vacations. Call me if you need anything. -I could return sooner if... -Enough. I'll be fine. I've left a few casseroles in the freezer case. But if you hate stews. My God, my God. What? Sometimes he called me. What? It notes that it is far, but also it seems to be close. He did not pick up the phone. Please, you deserve better. You know what? -I give a fuck where you are. -He's in Iraq. Iraq? He's doing extraordinary things. I not stop thinking about that day in New York. No laps I miss him. I do not understand how you kept her composure. That's already happened. And it was not always easy. When I go from here could ...? No better not. Nerd. Talk Talk. Knowing that you would give me another chance I give me strength sufficient to withstand what is ahead of me. Is there any chance that let me go home? A Georgetown. With you. No no no. Good... Today I experienced one of those moments loftiest and exquisite in all my life. I spent all night watching at Camp el-Sadr. In the desert it gets very cold at night. Tension and doubt Calan you to the bone. I wondered why he was doing this. If there was any real reason for me to be here. And I heard music. El-Sadr found, God knows how, A recording of the Prussian military march and he puts it through the speakers of the camp. I have no idea how he knew I love that song from childhood. And let alone where he could find her. The men were put into training and I paid tribute. I said I belonged there. My efforts They had not been in vain. Who had made a difference. And I thought that... It was at the time that it was me home. Ahead. Sorry, I was getting the mail. One second. TAX RETURN Okay, so better. Yeah, come over here. I have said dozens or even hundreds of times. I am not guilty of murder my wife, Elsa Breht. I have understood that no longer represent to Mr. Mott. Where is the defendant? Your Honor, Mr. Mott refuses to talk me and my partner for several weeks, so we can not follow. What you are happening literate? Mr. Mott has begun a hunger strike. Now is very weak and they have admitted to the hospital. Therefore, we have sent a request to declare him unfit for trial. The court will have to make a decision in respect. Of course. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Do you really going to help you get away with? We have to wait for the evaluation. -If you are found unfit... -he is faking. It's obvious. I pretended everything. That does not know. I do not even know. The more I know about him, the less I understand. Everything he says is a fucking lie. Can be. But what about what Iraq? How the hell did what he did there? Can you explain it to me? I do not know. Can not you do this morning? Yeah right. But I'd rather do it now. You stay up until 2 am and you wake me when you upload. Sorry to disturb your rest for wanting to pick up after our party. Our party? As if I'd let choice. That's Amanda, right? She has put you in a bad mood. I do not know why you keep inviting the bitter bitch. Do not talk about my daughter. And do not you dare smoke in my house. If great. We can talk? By phone no. Is not safe. It has to be in person. Who? Who are you talking about? Silence. Well, as you can. We can see us now. No, that's nothing. Shut the fuck up. Can not you give me a single breath? Do please drag you to your bed. Go to sleep. Sorry. See you where ever? Yes, excellent, excellent. What? Who was? That's privileged information and is not within reach. You're late. Already Halloween? I should have dressed as a cowboy. Which majo. Drink something. I'll ask another. How old? If you're still with her. Well, if she's still with us. Elsa is fine, thanks. And yes, our relationship is going great. It's a great woman. Genial. It would not be who I am if not for Elsa. I am aware that I owe to her. Although I have clear now I'm much better than her. It's not his fault, of course. Each takes its way. She gave me wings with which I learned to fly. I have big projects. Great adventures. Vast horizons to explore. And it would take me a good soldier beside me. What do you say? Like old times. Good, I did not know that mediocre powders I had become a good soldier. I know it took a long time no sign of life and I'm sorry. I understand how difficult it must have been for you. He was doing a job difficult but necessary. -I could not get in contact with you. -Do not. Of course not. But I warn you. It can not be like before. From now on we have to be extremely discreet. You may need to give you a couple of classes respect. Even on surveillance detection. Now I have a lot to lose. Not only Elsa. Many people might be at risk if my reputation is compromised. You know what? He'd better not take the risk. Wait. The old woman was right. You are pathetic. - Where have you been? - Working. Ah, yes, trabajÃ¡ndote one of your little friends. Shut. One of your friends filthy Sodomites. Shut the fuck up. Amanda was right. I should not have left back. Â¿Amanda? Do you have the courage to mencionÃ¡rmela tonight? He is having had the courtesy to invite and allow it codease with very powerful people in my triumphant night? And on top before you go try dinner, as niÃ±ata American malcriada it is. Outside. I do not want you here. Go away. This is my home. I live here and you'd have to take years and in the cemetery. -But you're here. -You should not be here. And all thanks to the charity of Ulrich Mott Gero, Count Albie and Brigadier General of the Republic of Iraq. Brigadier general, of course. What? The great general brigadier, the star man in the ass. So sad. Denigrating to feel better. The wonderful American rescue. What a coincidence, right? Often lucky. You do not know what I went through. I am more important than you think. You are not able to understand. Nor endure you no longer need. I'm better than you. You can not stand it no longer your fucking butler. I know you're not my butler. You know? You're a fucking motel receptionist. Yes, a receptionist at a seedy hotel. What? You spent two years in a crummy hotel TV, breakfast and heated pool. Yes. I've found everything. I've seen all your documentation. I have seen your tax returns. All. Moron. You gave them the address of this house as your permanent residence. Poor fool. Two years working in a seedy motel. I do not know what you're talking about. Ah, excuse me, in Villa Zarathustra, with your leader and all those troops. Moron. You're an Idiot. Do you hear me? Moron. Moron. Crazy. The men were put into training and I paid tribute. I said I belonged there. That my efforts had not been in vain. Who had made a difference. You should have come home with that uniform. ---oOo---
