It's my wedding anniversary next month. What do you do on yours? I look up restaurants she might like, maybe get her a small present. I hate shopping. Wouldn't Nami- san like it if you took her to see a play? Or contemporary dance. How did you know? You're amazing. She loves that stuff. She would. Been a while. What's this? Take a look. What's going on? This is where I work. Private detective? Having to investigate you was a surprise. You want money? Oh no, I'm an upright investigator. But since it's you, it's hard to be impartial. Though I did hesitate. You won't tell her? I'm in two minds. It's business. Can't you let this slide? Well well... You won't tell her? What do you want? I'd like you to think of it. For now, tonight... I know a great place. Did you eat raw fish? Is it sushi? I love it. Let's go then. About your wife, Chikako- san. You had a thing for girls like her in university. Really? Cute but feisty, girly girls. Yeah, maybe. Why did you decide to get married? I dunno. We'd been dating for two years, so it kinda... That's a reason to get married. If you're too picky, you'll never get married. It's not mandatory. You haven't changed. What's your problem. I want to be good to Chikako. My actions may seem strange to you, but the emotion is totally different. I was so stupid. But as a man, surely you can understand. Why do you want to be good to her? Because I love her. Goes without saying. Love? Not just kind of? I love her. I'll fix this. Please. Thank you for the dinner. You won't tell Chikako. You smell. Have you quit smoking? Chikako doesn't like it. Hey. I said only kissing. You don't want this to get wrinkled. Sorry. What are you sorry about? I can't. Even though it's just a kiss? It's not that easy. Are you in love with me? I love you. No tongue. Beggars can't be choosers. Let's go somewhere to eat next weekend. Anything you'd like to eat? Why? It'd be nice to go watch a movie. We could go shopping afterwards. There's a movie I want to see. Let's watch it. It's a horror movie. Horror? Sounds good. I was planning to go shopping. I'm excited. Me too. Hello. - Hello. Come in. What are you doing? The hell? Did you break up with her? If your wife finds out on her own, it's gonna look bad on my CV. Are you still snooping on me? I've told your wife I have proof of your cheating. She asked me to continue. I'll break up with her. Why not go back there and say it? Or you can text her right now. Fuck that. You choose your wife as soon as things get inconvenient for you. Doesn't matter how you end it, it's cruel anyway. Yeah, but she doesn't... She's the one who said it's okay. She doesn't care that I'm married. I didn't know how to turn her down after that. That's what this is. I've only been here three times. I won't see her again. But how would she feel if I texted her now? I think there's a proper way to end things. I'll report this. Why? You know why. This is business. Imagase. Hey. Only kissing. Doesn't matter where I place it. I'm home. I'm home. What's the matter? Came to say I'm home. I could use a shower. Okay, I'll get out. Ootomo- san. - Yes? I've edited my proposal after last meeting. Could you take a look? Show me. Are you in the mood for coffee? Shall I fetch some? I couldn't sleep last night. Wanna go together? Good job. Thank you. I'll submit it then. Do that. You do look tired. I've had trouble falling asleep. What about you? When do you go to bed? This is embarrassing, but usually I'm in bed by 10. That's quite early. But a good routine. You think so? Note: Please try this if you'd like. I'm ready. I'll take this one. Shiba shrimp in chili sauce. Please enjoy. Thanks for today. No problem. I'm sorry for not taking you out lately. You work so hard. We could go on a holiday. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I want to... separate. Wait, let's talk this out. It's a misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? I'm sorry for not telling you. I hired a private detective to investigate your affairs. You are... the perfect husband. Nothing came up. I hoped you'd be cheating on me, so I could get a hefty divorce settlement. I'm seeing someone. It's been going on for over a year. Did you not notice? I trusted you. Trusted me? Our relationship... You bring in the money, and I spend it. That's all we ever had in common. Surely not just that. The way you're always waiting for me to say something... I can't stand it. For him... I want to separate. Hello. Did you know? About what? The reason Chikako hired you. Reason? Sorry. I'll call you later. Did something happen? Nothing. Do you think a client would confide in me like that? Nah. Sorry. I'll call you later. Wait. You called me because of her. Told you it's nothing. Did she want a divorce? None of your business. Are you separating? We are. I see. The divorce is definite then. That means my investigation is over. Who're you talking to? Sorry. I've interrupted something. I'm hanging up. Take care. Who was that? Someone I've loved for a long time. Are you a freshman? - Yes. Interested in our tennis club? Would like to you join our club? I kinda like it when a girl acts difficult. I see. You like it. You know my address? A house warming gift. A little late. Coming in? Loneliness getting to you yet? I'm enjoying myself. I'm free to do what I want. Look at you cooking. What about you? All well with the boyfriend? Pardon? We broke up long ago. Would you date me? Why should I date a guy? Let's have drinks every once in a while. Maybe go to hot springs over the holidays. Hot springs you say... Sounds nice. Stop that. Hokushou High School Reunion Attend / Do not attend Get out of my bed. Are you going to the class reunion? Why do you ask? You might find an old crush has become quite the milf. A few flattery words, and you're up for anything. What's your problem? Don't. Fucking stop doing that. Let me sleep. You're a sore loser for a man. Who says I'm losing. I won't go to the reunion. Following our last meeting, we have reconsidered the presentation of the product. The creative department will walk you through it. May I ask you to take a look at this clip. Ootomo- san. - Yes? It's been a while. Is it true that you divorced? It's true. Is it my fault? It's not. Okay... You were so good to your wife. Why did you ghost me? Sorry. I was busy moving. Do you live alone now? I do. Are you eating well? I am. Stop worrying. You look like you've lost weight. Do I? You look different. I have to go. See you. - Later. Kiss me. Go away. Asshole. You're heavy. - Pick my ear. No. Shall I pick yours? Would you? I'm a pro at this. I can't see. Hello. Are you home? Yeah. About to go inside. Sorry for calling you so suddenly. Is something wrong? I feel awkward about how we left things off earlier. Next meeting has already been scheduled, hasn't it? I'd hate for it to get awkward. I missed you. Do you hate me now? Sorry, it got late. You must have eaten already. I have. What was for dinner today? - Gratin. I kinda want some. Greedy. Save it for tomorrow. You'll gain weight. Right. Sorry. I'll have it tomorrow. How about bath? Is it ready? I just ran it. I'll go in then. Stop that. You still haven't cut that woman off. Thought you said you don't even love her. I ran into her at work. She wanted to see me, I couldn't say no. As if you couldn't. You're a pussy. You're not my boyfriend. True. So why lie? I'm sorry I lied. I thought you wouldn't like the truth. I'm not as good of a person as you think. I'm aware. You're the absolute worst. But do you think we're all just looking for that perfect person, a pretty face to make us feel good all the time? That's not how it goes. Imagase. What are you doing? Are you still mad at me? Why did you call? Figures. Bye. I've been all over the country looking for a missing person. Where are you now? At home. Alone? Yes. Want to grab dinner? Right now? How have you been this past week? Same as always. What's the occasion? Got late- night cravings and couldn't bother calling up a lady friend? And you? Why did you come? I'm a man who comes running for the person I love. Your missing person? A man or a woman? A woman. What about it? Did you find her? She was dead. Aren't you coming in? May I? Of course you can. Will you let me fuck you? Just get in. Here. How did you know? - I just do. Have you found a new girlfriend yet? Kyouichi? Natsuki? It's been so long. Your divorce comes as no surprise. Did Drifting Samurai cheat again? Drifting Samurai... Brings back memories, doesn't it? It does. Are you still in contact with the gang? I went to Asami- chan's wedding. Did she get hitched? I see Yoshikawa and Tsuchida from time to time. Invite me too. I'll let you know next time. Oh? Natsuki- sempai? Imagase! Long time no see! How are you doing? Ootomo- sempai. It's been a while. Long time no see. May we join you? I'm with a friend. Sure. Nice to meet you, I'm Takasugi. Imagase is an old friend. Sorry for interrupting your evening. Did you come just now? - Yes. What would you like to drink? Ootomo- sempai, isn't it? - What of it? I've heard so much about you. Are you and Ootomo- sempai still together? God no! We ran into each other the other day. You look pretty as ever. Stop it. I've aged a lot. - Not at all. Are you married? Oh no, not even close. What about you? I'm... desperately trying to get the person I love to look my way. Tell me more. Mind if I smoke? - Go ahead. Have you been snooping on my phone again? You read my texts. Why are you seeing her? Who's that guy with you? He wanted to catch up over dinner. Wouldn't he be a better fit for you? Stop. I don't give a shit about what you do with whom. But you and him are the same, it's a totally different world from mine. Sorry. I phrased it poorly. Imagase had somewhere to go. Okay... He sent his regards. Imagase has had a glow up, don't you think? Huh... Yeah, maybe. I think he was in love with you back then. Why? Now that I think of it, he was often looking our way. I thought maybe he had a crush on me, but the lighter gave him away. Lighter? Do you remember the fight we had, how you were still using the lighter from your ex? Doesn't ring any bells. The pink Zippo. The one that screamed lady friend. Do you really not remember? I gave it away. Imagase asked to have it. He was still using it. Knows how to take care of his things. Later. I'll get off here, too. No need, I've got this. I can see that. Natsuki. - What? Long time no see. Yeah right. Do you have the keys? Why did you drink so much? The keys. In your bag? Where in here? - Dunno. Hey now. Help me out. You said in the bag? You're home. Huh... You're back. Thought you fucked off with that guy. You're wasted. Can you stand? Thank you for bringing him home. Would you like to come in? No thanks, it's so late. Good night then. Back in university... I was pretty sure you hated my guts. Hey. Alright. Yeah. Bye. From Natsuki- sempai? She wants to meet me tonight. I see. You fine with that? Go ahead. There he comes. - Sorry. Where you you wanna go? You didn't pick a place? - I told you to pick it. I'm home. That was quick. Was it? Where are my PJs? Creep. You're not drunk this time. So what? What did she want? Nothing. I'll go take a walk. Don't go far. So scary. Who knows what this vindictive homosexual wants from me? That pumped up look on your face leaves me petrified. I got a lot of relationship advice from you when I was with Kyouichi. You did it on purpose. You knew how I felt about him. You tried so desperately to break us up with your "advice". Excuse me. One Singha, please. Carlsberg, please. This is on me. Let's order. I'll pay for myself. Back off. Excuse me. These two please. I've finally reached this point. I've had to hustle for this. How long have you loved him? Since I first spoke to him. What's so great about him? You know there's no reason. Eight years... I salute you. Well persevered. You're only hurting yourself by continuing. Set yourself free. Kyouichi is like a Hamelin rat following the Piper. I can't have him drown in the gutter. Gutter. Gutter. What do you think you're doing? Why the hell did you call Natsuki? I called him. The more the merrier. You haven't said anything weird to her? Say something. What weird thing? Now that we're here, make a choice. Imagase or me. Who will you be taking home tonight? What's your deal? Carlsberg for me. Hey. Could it be that you can't choose? What do you want? Do you get it? It's girls or guys. I get that. How far have you done it? Wait. I don't want to hear it. Aren't you just going with the flow? Ahead is a point of no return. Show no mercy as you drive him into a corner. A womanly approach. You have to leave a man a chance to escape or he'll die. Especially a man like him. Perhaps you're so hung up on him because he was your first. How was your first time? I'd like to hear. - Cut it. Has he told you? The fuck I care. Freshman year in high school, a club sempai made me stay for extra rehearsal. A guy? - Of course. After school, in the shower, from behind. Cut it. I don't want to hear any of that shit. What the hell... I could never choose you. No straight guy would. You get it, don't you? Yes. That settles it. Let's go. I don't want to make him sad. What's making me feel this way... I don't know. What are you trying to say? Making excuses for not getting it up? Miss me with that. Have you ever truly been in love? I'm out. TV: They are here. I'm home. I heard you and waited for you. Where shall we hide? Watching a movie? Yeah. You burn like ice. You still have a human warmth... I love you. I love you. Will you obey me? Sleep with me. If you refuse, I will not touch you again. All you have to say is no. This is why you get cornered. Do not try to understand what I am going to do. For in truth it would be difficult to understand even in our world. Bath is ready. I'll get up. Shall I wash your hair? Let me go alone. I'll make us lunch. Still gonna keep your lease? The rent is a waste. Saturday next week. Know what day that is? Mr. Imagase Wataru turns 27. Any requests? Go on. I want to eat Peking duck. Okamura- san. Do you know your wines? Not really. I'd like to give someone a birth year wine. But I have no clue about wines. My friend is a wine expert, I'll have them make a list for tomorrow. Could you do that? - Yes. Thanks. Is it for your girlfriend? Not a girlfriend. Here. - What? It's your birthday. It's past midnight. As for for Peking duck, I've made reservations for tomorrow. That alone would be lame, so this is a little extra, a surprise. Come on. Thank you. This is too much, what's gotten into you? Oh? It looks fancy. I won't open this. Let's open it. Then I'd no longer have it. I'll buy you a new one next year. Problem solved. I forgot to buy snacks. Do we still have dry- cured ham? Okamura- san Stay here for a sec. This is it. - Thanks. You came on your day off? - Yes. Is that alright? - No problem at all. Hello. Hello. He's a good friend. My name is Okamura. Ootomo- san is always helping me out. My name is Imagase. Thanks for helping him. I bought this cheesecake, please share it. Thanks. You don't mind? - Of course. I'll better get going. - Thanks a lot. Couldn't have waited until Monday? She needed a quick review. Wonder what that cheesecake was for. How so? Perhaps she was wishing you'd invite her over to share it. That's crazy. She's just very considerate. Let's go, Peking Duck. What? Where are we going? Just around the corner. I'm hungry. Ootomo- kun. - Yes? I believe you saw us this morning. What did you make of it? I didn't think much of it. Surely you found it improper for my age. Did I look like a sugar daddy? It's a free world. Free world... She's my daughter, Tamaki. I didn't want you to get the wrong idea. I didn't expect her to be your daughter. Will you keep this between us? Tamaki is my illegitimate daughter. But I didn't get her the job. She did it on her own to surprise me. You see... She's very dear to me. You're all she talks about these days. How long this time? I'll be back in four or five days. Safe travels. Get some pears while you're there. Do you like them? - I do. Pears have quite a feminine form. Do they now? Bet you'd like to regain your old self, sleep with a woman for a change. What makes you say that? Back then, I wanted to be your cigarette. I envied it, pinched between your fingers. You're such a fool. Okamura- san? I'm all right. It would look strange for a mere employee to cry too much. I know standing here also looks strange. But I couldn't leave him. It's work- related. I wasn't asking. Cheers. This is what we've been doing. Looking great. - Good to hear. A long day of work. - Indeed. Tired? - Not at all. I'm a tough cookie. You're late. Who were you with? At work. What about Okamura Tamaki? She was there. She's my subordinate. The cheesecake girl. Daughter of the director. Could tell she knows nothing about the real world. Think you know her after saying hello? You're getting sick of me. I've become a burden. The fuck? Your mourning clothes. Why didn't you have them dry- cleaned? Was it intentional? Wanted me to take the hint? What? - The make- up stains. Couldn't have been accidental. Nothing's going on with her. Consoling her for her loss was the least anyone could do. I don't know. Was it not because you're screwing her? Don't. How far have you done it? Come on. - Tell me the truth. I told you already. You're not right for me. Since I'm not right for you. What do you mean? Are you serious? I am. Yeah, maybe. If you say it's not working, then it must be true. Let's end this. You've been hurting. A guy like you, you know. You should be with a woman who'll drop in to prepare a long cook stew. You're funny. That's the kind of a woman that suits you. I don't know about that. As for you... Find someone who's more affectionate. More affectionate? Someone who'll appreciate you more, who'll love you. Someone who'll love me... That's something you would say. Are you a smoker? My ex left it. Told me to keep it. As if I needed that to remember them. What were they like? A woman who smokes. Cool and mature, I'd imagine. But lonely on the inside. I'm sorry, it's none of my business. Why did it end? It ended unceremoniously, with them saying I'm not right for them. I could see they were hurting. I was happy with them, though. I'm self- centered. I should have let them go sooner. - I'm sorry for asking stupid questions. I'd hate to repeat the mistakes of your ex. Come here. If you love someone too much... ...you'll lose yourself and shatter. Hey there, waiting for someone? No. - Do you come here often? First time. - Would you like to chat? Cheers. What's his problem? Everything okay? Something the matter? I'm sorry. What's wrong? What do you think? Mom. Wonderful. He would always try to fix this. He'd use just about every trick in the book. I think that won't be needed anymore. Thank you. I also have some jars that won't open, would you be so kind? Of course. So beautiful. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Let me see. So lovely. I'm happy for you. Wait. I said wait. Who's paying you? You've been watching me. Since we broke up. You wish. I'm not that bored. Did you steal my bike? It'd been gathering dust. Don't worry, I'm taking good care of it. You wanted me to notice. Your hiding place was shit. Maybe you already know, but I've decided to get married. Is that so? You'll make a wonderful couple. I won't stand on your way. How have you been? Doing okay? Keep me near you. I'm not going to stop you from getting married. Just once a month, once in six months, I just want to see you. I don't need sex. I won't cause you problems. I'll do whatever you say. I don't need that. I don't need you anymore. That's it. From the beginning. You could have told me that when we first met. I'm making burger patties. Mom taught me the trick to make them juicy. What flavor? - Is Japanese ok? Sounds good. Were you vacuuming? Are you into slow cooking? Slow cooking? Do you like stews? Wasn't really implying that. I'll ask Mom for the recipe. You've received the curtains. When? When did you receive them? Last week I think. Okay. I'll open it. Beautiful work. Just like you said, blue was the right choice. I'll clean up the table. Thanks for the food. There's pudding, want some? I'll make a long- cook stew next time. I'll take over. You don't have to. I'll leave once I've finished. You won't stay over? I'll see you off. You can leave the dishes. Is she gone? She's not staying over tonight. Let's go. - Ugly curtains. - Yeah. - You're a terrible man. Break up with her. Can't do that, can you? I'll do it. When? Tomorrow. Liar. It's not like you. Why not continue without getting caught? You won't do it. - What do you want? There's a billion things in life more important than suffering for love. We're too old for this. Come live with me. - I'm sorry. My ex came back. - I see. So they came back. Are you getting back together? Will you marry them? - I... Even if the road is hard... ...I want to make it work. But they left again. - In that case... Can't I stay with you? If she comes back, I'll step away quietly. Can't we do that? Why aren't you saying anything? Are you thinking of someting nice to say? If you want to break up, you have to speak up. No matter if it makes me hate you. - I was going to keep up this arrangement. I don't mind at all. - I really am sorry. Sorry. I couldn't help myself... I'm sorry. Maybe this is finally the time they won't come back. But I want to wait. I want to spend time alone, doing what I can to prepare. - You trust they will come back. - You'll have anyone who'll love you, but ultimately you can't trust that love, so you sniff about the feelings of whoever comes near you. Right? I despise guys like you. - My bad. - To truly love someone, is for them to become your only exception. Not that you'd understand. - I do understand. I'm sorry. Thanks for everything. - I truly... ...did love you.
