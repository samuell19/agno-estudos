Well fix it. Oh anything you said lover. Gotcha that time you little worm. So this is how they do things at the famous Saturn Theater. ♪ Just one look ♪ ♪ And felt so oh oh oh ♪ ♪ In love ♪ ♪ With you ♪ ♪ I thought I was dreaming but I was wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh but I'm gonna keep on feeling ♪ Who are you? Who are you? Neil Allan, Willy Loam. Hi. Nice to meet you. The best stage manager in the business. Hi nice to meet you. Now, where the hell have you been? I just got off the bus. I needed to see a friendly face. The bus? I seem to recall that you left in a Rolls Royce. Well things happen in two years. The place folded. Colin Beverly bought the lease and closed us down. Really? Well you always got a job here darling. I think someone else has got my job. Me? It's okay. Through with the business anyway. Did I hear you correctly? Through. You're through with the business? You'll eat those words, that's how you're feeling tonight darling but this is our 15th anniversary Willie. This is new year's Eve. It's just another concert Max. No Willie no. From that stage they all look the same. Willie I'm surprised that you, this is where the magic happens. Come on. Max Wolfe is a piss ant and the Saturn Theater has got to go. Disappear. Evaporate. Personally, I like Max. Nice guy. Sweetheart. But I've got a business to run. Major industry. An empire. And Max Wolfe stands in the way of progress. Obstinate. Pig-headed and that's costing us money. We can't have that. Gotta stop. His time has passed. A has been. History. Take it down. Land it. On the ground. Collin Beverly, you're here. That's fantastic, fantastic. You're going to see my uncle. Wonderful, wonderful. Here. Let me get the door for you. This is an honor Mr. Beverley. You're my hero. You're rich, you're powerful, you're famous, you're ruthless. Nobody fucks with you, you fuck with everybody. I love it. Do you need tickets? Your should have called me, you know I can work miracles around here. You're going to see my uncle, Max Wolfe. You know he's a big fan of yours so talks about you all the time. Colin Beverly get out of my theater. Max, you're beautiful. What a sense of humor. Funny man. Laughs. Every time I set foot in this place, I'm awestruck. The stars, the tradition, the magic. It's like a- - A shrine. - A temple. - Like coming home. If I was your mother I'd have drowned you at birth. This man is a prince. Do you know that he gave me my very first job 10 years ago. Imagine me an usher here at the Saturn Theater. An usher. He lasted a week. I fired him because he scalped tickets, sold bad dope to the kids and drilled peep holes in the ladies room floor. Those were the days Maxie. Max you're beautiful don't ever change. You know because I respect you as a human being Max I'm gonna make you another wonderful offer. Fantastic offer. Fabulous offer. I'll give you a million dollars cash up front and you sign over the lease to me. The answer is still no. Get out of my theater. Max you put on good shows, think of what you could do with my auditorium, 22,000 seats. Out. Think of my stadium, 84,000 seats. Out. Four days at each place, free rain. Out. Uncle Max, people would kill for a deal like that. Yeah? Well let 'em. I put on shows at the Saturn so that the kids can see the stage afford the tickets and hear the music, so screw stadiums. Now you come back and talk to me in 15 years my lease will be over, you talk to me then. Okay I'll make it a Million two in six days and when the building goes up, right they're chiseled in granite, right in the corner of the building, "Max Wolfe, a man of integrity."

This place got to be like living at home. I had to find out if I was any good or if it was just the Saturn. What'd you find out? I was fine. My partner was a jerk.
