Bring the glass closer to your lips and take a sip. It’ll give you a refreshing flavour. Then slowly gulp it down. Ok. Pour one more dude. We’ll do it this time. This guy won’t drive steady! What? You’re spilling the drink brother. Oh, is it spilling over? What a fragrance. Cheers. What dude! If you guys wanted to gulp it down like this… You could have had some local brand. Give me the glass.

Sir...He has some health issues. That might be true, but we are helpless. You know it is in section 302. Murder. You know the procedure right? We can’t do anything about it. There is solid evidence. We have to proceed with that. Sir, what if we could use some influence? As I’d already told you, this is a murder. We’ll move according to procedure. Alright then… We’ll talk later. Alright then sir.

Saying the same thing over and over again. You explain. I transferred my property in my daughters name after her marriage. She has nowhere else to stay. He’s been troubling me ever since. Now you explain. Sir, he’d given her a fair share before marriage. Brother in law’s alcoholism destroyed everything. Dad promised me the house and made me refurbish it on a loan. My family will be homeless if he gives her property. I’ll make one thing clear. Issues in your family should be sorted in your home. It shouldn’t be a nuisance for the public.

The kids these days. We won’t have to face anything. Sir, one minute. What? I am Rameshan’s friend. I don’t know who those kids are to you. Rameshan is an innocent person. He wouldn’t have done this. My friend, I don’t know who you are. If you have anything to say, the concerned authority is sitting inside. Go on and talk to the S.I. Why are you telling me all this? Sir, over there is Rameshan’s wife. A mother of two girls. Rameshan would never have done it. They said there was evidence, that your kids have shot some video. Rameshan would never do such a a thing sir. He wouldn’t kill anybody. What are you blabbering? You guys are rich. You could easily erase this case if you want to. You would easily save your kids too. We wouldn’t even get the benefit of doubt from this station. What is he talking about sir? Stop, stop, stop. Who is this guy? Go on, walk away. We are just poor people. Sit down sir. What was the use of telling us all these? Sir this is the F.I.R of Rameshan’s case. This is the F.I.R of Rameshan’s case. Are the statements by the kids clear? The accused Rameshan Drove with Vineeth the victim, and his friends from Thiruvanthapuram to Ponmudi in the car in which he was working as a taxi driver. In between an argument broke out between the accused and the victim. Due to this with the intention to kill, the victim was taken to Mangayar water falls And was drowned and murdered by the accused. And found guilty as per the above mentioned sections Do you want to be specifically told. Sit down. Why do you have to enquire about unnecessary stuff You just had to drive. Drive the vehicle. He’s no more Brother, hiring the car around let’s go. Rameshan, you are under custody. Stop the car, I said stop the car. Sir is calling you. Go. Brother, there is no such thing as God. No matter how much angry you are, always react with a smile on your face. Don’t just wander around here. Go and brush your teeth. Dad, did we buy uncle’s car Judging by looks he wouldn’t have done this murder You don’t have to think about that. Produce him in court with the evidence that we have. and.. Make those kids sign the papers and let them go. 4 of you can put down your name’s and signature’s and go. Ramesha, get up and come. Go Sit down over there. As he’s ready for a one time settlement, What is the maximum time bank can give? Not more than 3 months. That’s the maximum Bank and party is ready for settlement, your honour The honourable court can decide on the timings. Are you ok with 3 Yes sir. Else, action will be taken against you. CC1623/2017 Accused- Ramesh Balakrishnan Proceed Rameshan Did you go to Mangayar on the 15th of August 2017 Yes I did. How did you go? Sir, I was an online taxi driver. I went there because, all of them booked a ride. Around what time did you reach Mangayar? I don’t remember the time exactly It would have been between 2pm and 3pm 2 or 3 ? How much time did you spend there? How much time did you spend at Mangayar region? After I dropped them off there. I snoozed off sir. Afterwards when they came back and woke me. Probably 45minutes. As per you You say you weren’t at that spot when the incident happened? No Then , aren’t you the one on the video clip produced before court? Aren’t you the same person on the video? Yes Sir at the time of incident He say’s he was not there. But He admits that he is the same person in the video produced before the court as evidence. From this The prosecution fully convinced that Rameshan has committed the murder. Objection your Honour. Objection sustained Do you know that, all 4 of them have given statement against you? Yes The first witness Devan Shot a video of Rameshan murdering Vineeth And has produced it before the honourable court Do you know that? Yes According to it, did you kill Vineeth? No sir. I haven’t killed anyone. Are you sure? Yes sir. I was trying to save him. Are you telling us that you are innocent? Yes I swear Your honour Rameshan insists that He is innocent And has not committed To understand about the further details of this case I humbly seek permission to cross examine the first witness Devan. Permission granted. Is devan your original name? Yes sir. The Relationship between you and the deceased? We were friends. What was the intent behind your journey? It was a holiday sir So we friends decided to go on a trip Everybody went on a trip to enjoy holiday right? Yes Did you drink? Did you drink? A little While drunk did you have an argument among each other. No sir. Then between whom it happen? The conflict occurred between this driver and Vineeth. For that conflict to occur was the driver drunk? The driver wasn’t drunk sir. Should the court believe it? But sir? All of us were drunk. But it was between them that the conflict happened. Between whom? Vineeth and this driver The hastle between the deceased Vineeth and Rameshan Yes Sir Then? It resulted in a small exchange of blows. Then we had to separate them. Then we continued our journey Then what happened? Then we all went to take a bath He said, he will stay back and did not come. So Vineeth stayed back. You guys went for a bath. Then? After a while. We heard loud noises What we saw when we went there was Vineeth and the driver were fighting each other in the water. Oh is it? What you saw was Vineeth and Rameshan fighting in the water. Yes Then Rameshan was forcefully trying to drown Vineeth in the water. Rameshan forcefully drowned Vineeth in the water. Yes sir. The video that you submitted was of that. Yes When your friend was in danger Instead of trying to save him, why did you shoot the video? Sir, that was because none of us knew how to swim Aren’t you a youngster. Yes While you learned to drink Didn’t you learn a basic trait like swimming? That’s because No Sir Didn’t you know even a little bit of swimming No So you are saying Rameshan is the one who drowned and murdered Vineeth Yes sir Did you hear Devan’s statement in front of the court? Devan says In between your journey You and the deceased Vineeth Had a verbal argument And for taking revenge for it Rameshan took vineeth to the waterfall And drowned and murdered him Is the statement made in court. It’s an absolute lie sir. They are absolutely lying. After they got in the car Everyone was drinking. All the argument and hassles happened between them. I saw them for the first time sir. The argument happened them. Yes. Nothing had happened between you of any sort. No. Your Honour Rameshan repeatedly emphasis that No argument of any sort had happened. But Devan says An argument did occur And for taking revenge for it The murder was committed. Since these two statements Are contradicting each other To the Honourable court. For submitting more evidences And to cross examine other witnesses, I humbly plead to be allotted more time. On behalf of producing more evidences This case has been post ponded to August 14th Vineeth murder case is having a decisive turning point As the strike for justice by Rameshan’s wife and kids reach 327 days We know that the protest has led to big discussions among Keralites The incident which led to the case happened on 15th August 2017 Family is protesting to prove the innocence of the accused But there is no development in the case yet Sir I ask permission to cross examine ASI Gokul Das Who had prepared the charge sheet Permission granted. Thank you sir ASI Gokul Das right? Yes sir. Does Mangayar come under your jurisdiction? Yes, Mukkatussery Police station Did you personally go the place of the incident? I did What did you see there? Sir, we went there based on an information we got What was the condition when you reach there? The dead body was kept on land. We immediately sent the body to a hospital in an ambulance. Was Rameshan present there at that time? He was sir. What was his condition? When we had reached there, he was wet and tired Oh is that so Yes By tired do you mean? It could have been after a physical struggle. You could interpret it like that. What were the other aspects Which persuaded the police to convict Rameshan? Sir firstly, the evidence obtained from the preliminary investigation Secondly the similarities in all their statements. Then the video clip obtained from them. Apart from all this The contradiction in Rameshan’ s behaviour between incident spot and police station Sir, he wasn’t answering to questions we were asking That’s all your honour Do you remember this bag? Do you remember this bag? Isn’t this vineeth’s bag? It is This is Vineeth’s bag. Isn’t it? Yes As in the bag used by Vineeth on the day he was murdered. Yes Do you know from where I got this bag? Do you ? I don’t know I got his bag from top of the waterfall. Let it be. Did you go on top of the waterfall? Did you go on the top of the waterfall? First we did go the top of the waterfall Nothing specific happened there. We simply went there It did not look like appropriate spot to hang out. We right away. Isn’t it? We came back right away sir. So you went on top of the waterfall? Disposed of the bag there Came back quickly. Isn’t that right? That Your honour Regarding this case In none of the statement given by these 4 people Haven’t even once mentioned that they went on top of the waterfall As the first evident for the case Only after seeing the bag that I have produced before the court They admit that it is Vineeth’s bag and they did go on top of the waterfall It should be understood that the statement made till now were contradictory It is clear that they are hiding information regarding this case from the court Regarding this case The second evidence I am producing before court is Vineeth’s post mortem report The post mortem repost and the police report is heavily contradictory According to the post mortem report The time Vineeth’s death is 3.30pm On the video produced by the witness’s to the police The time of Vinneth’s death is between 4:07 and 4:11pm That is The time of the death on post mortem report The time of the death on the video clip Is differing by 30 minutes. The court should note that a big contradiction is present here. Objection your Honour. Mobile is just a device for us to set the time accordingly Even then Difference of 30 minutes Cannot be considered as a valid point Medical science can only give a discreet idea of mans time of death If we want to know minutes and seconds accurately We should be asking the medical god himself Objection overruled. One fact remains which even god cannot deny sir. In Vineeth’s post mortem report A critical wound behind his head was stated. For having a such wound Somebody should stab him with a stone Or beat him with a log. Or he should have slipped down and hit his head on a rock. Anyone of these could have been the reason for the death. Honestly Not Rameshan They killed Vineeth Isn’t that right? No Sir. I saw this guy killing him. It was him. From the start of the journey All 5 of you were drinking. Getting really drink, you guys fought with each other As a revenge for that A deadly wound behind Vineeth’s head was stated in the post mortem report Because of the fight which happened when you were drunk I say Vineeth was beaten to death and thrown into the water. Can you deny it? No sir. That’s not how it was Then how did Vineeth die? How did it happen? That was how we told It was him I certainly say that It is not Rameshan who killed Vineeth Resulting the fight between you guys I repeatedly say it was you who beat up and killed Vineeth Can you deny it? Else tell us. How did Vineeth die? That… Say how did he die? What happened that day? What happened that day Bro we shall try trekking too.

Then what are you talking about Just do as I say Or else, everybody will be trapped Understand? Shall we go then? Let’s get out here immediately Else there’s going to be trouble Lets call somebody who know’s swimming There is nothing we can do, he fell off Will anybody survive such a fall ? Try to understand that Still isn’t he our friend How can we just abandon him Not abandoning But he Weren’t you the one who fought with him I don’t have any issue It was all of you that beat him That driver knows about all this If he hears about any of this. He will say we killed him I won’t get caught, but you guys will You guys were the ones who beat him up Right? I didn’t do anything anyways I’ll escape from this You know me right Let’s go then Come on Fast You come Take those stuff Take it, take it fast Don’t take that bag Just take out stuff Fast Come on, come fast I’ll take my bag Bro help me out Climb up fast I am getting really scared Come fast Get in I’ll talk to him Don’t you say anything Remember what told you right None of you should talk Its our life Brother I am submitting a crucial evidence regarding this case to the court These are some pictures taken on Vineeth’s mobile before his death The time on the last picture But on he video produced before court The accused seems to have used physical force. It is true sir That thought might seem true up on seeing the video I have produced a medical certificate before you During the time that Ramesh worked in Dubai He met with an accident Because of that accident Hearing sounds above certain frequencies Can make him start behaving abnormally. He is facing such a disease When he dived in to the water to save Vineeth Up on loosing his hearing aid, the abnormal behaviour was triggered Rameshan had conveyed this to the police But the police hasn’t recorded this in any of their reports Abnormal behaviour was recorded by the witnesses and produced before the court And framed as Rameshan trying to kill Vineeth Sir, when all other photos and videos are deleted from phone And when only video was submitted as evidence There underlies a big lie in it sir We are living in a country where lot of legends have lived And I am bound to say helplessly that These 4 youngster’s are an example of how our society should not be Rameshan is not just a name sir A lot of such people are entwined in our judicial system like this To conclude Based on the evidences and witnesses produced This case should be re examined And since my client Rameshan been prove innocent before the court I humbly plead that he may be excused from this case That’s all your honour Does the prosecution have anything to say No sir Prosecution rests Vineeth murder case is having a decisive turning point Rameshan’s family is positive about the direction of the case After hearing both the defence and prosecution arguments The court understands that This case was fabricated by the witnesses to convict Rameshan Up on creating circumstantial evidences And by misleading the prosecution The court has lost its faith in them Since the prosecution has failed to prove Rameshan is guilty This court is setting Rameshan free And for misleading the court with fake evidences The witnesses are fined 1 lakh rupees each And for misdirecting the investigation The police is hear by criticised in a serious tone by the court The court orders this case to be re examined Prasad you don’t have to rush and come here We are coming over there You stay right there Yes, yes Here take this Come Start the car confidently Take Dad Start it Start the car
