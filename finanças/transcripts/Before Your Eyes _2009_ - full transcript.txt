BEFORE YOUR EYES Are you tired, sweetie? - You walk too fast. - Come on. Put the bags down here for a second. Firat, your bags are really heavy. You two wait for me here. I'm going to that shop over there. Gulistan, take care of your brother. Stay right here. - How much is a bunch of parsley? - 500. - I'll have one. - Take a plastic bag and serve yourself. - You haven't given me the money. - Here you are. - How much did you just give me? -10 million. How can I change so much money? Zelal! Zelal! - Sorry, but I can't wait. I have to go. - No problem, you're welcome here anytime. Zelal! Where are you? - Whom are you looking for, sir? - For my granddaughter Zelal. She must be over there. See her? No, there's no one. I don't know. She said she'd come back soon. Firat, stay here. I'll be right back. Okay, I'll wait here. Go away! She's still staring at me! - Are you Zelal? - Yes. So what? Your grandpa needs you. Didn't I tell you to stay here? Come on, move along. How you've grown! Did you miss me? I missed you, too. Let your aunt breathe. Firat, get us something to eat. Gulistan, help him. Sister, is something wrong? I'm just tired. Look what I have for Dilovan. And you? You're like the moon behind the clouds. We hardly see you anymore. Are you being careful? This city is full of Turkish soldiers. Shouldn't I feel safe? - Don't be afraid. They won't get me. - Yekbun, don't put your life in danger. Somebody has to. - How's school? - Fine. - Where are you going afterwards? - I'm going to the town hall. - Is Salih conning? - Salih? - Haven't you heard? - What? The police arrested him yesterday at a demonstration. - He'll be in jail at least three days. - Poor guy. - Incredible! - What? There aren't many police stations that Salih hasn't been in. I'll get my bag. - Where's Gule? - Over there! - What's this? - Photos of people killed in Xane. Send them to Istanbul for tomorrow's edition. Hello, Asmin. How are you? FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN XANE. "NO SUSPECTS" AGAIN! So the farmers gathered and tried to find a solution. They decided to trap the big bad wolf. All the village men took weapons and began the wolf hunt. They eventually spotted the big bad wolf. As some aimed to quickly shoot it, an old man shouted "Lay down your weapons!" The others were so surprised. The wise old man climbed down from his horse. He took a piece of meat out of his bag... and slowly, slowly approached the big bad wolf. Everyone watched him intensely. The feared wolf had become as tame as a pussycat. Did I wake you up? I'm sorry. Just as well... otherwise I never get to see you. How's Dilovan? Still feverish? Her fever's gone down. She probably had a slight cold. Your daughter's just like you. Always at my breast. I'm so tired. Sehmus will lend us his car for Saturday. That's great. The kids will be so happy. - What time are we going? - Midday. I met my sister Yekbun today. A boy from our village is hiding from the police. She asked if he could spend a night here. - Wait here, I'll get him. - All right. - I'm Memo. - I'm Vedat. And I'm Yekbun! Get going! Gulistan, what's the answer? I don't know. - And this one? - Firat, solve it yourself. - Having difficulties with the Turkish? - Yes. - Read it. If you can buy three suits for 360 liras... what is the price of one suit? What must you divide 360 by? Three. So divide. And the answer? - 120. - Good! Look, your dress for the wedding! Like it? - Isn't it pretty? - It's beautiful! Thanks so much! Got a light? Pardon? Fire, fire. Here. Thank you. Put that down. It's dirty. - What's that? - Go on, read it! - Have you called this girl? - I'm going crazy I call day and night But nobody answers. - I must know who she is. - Maybe it's a joke. That's what I thought So I called again yesterday. - Did someone answer? - Yes. But guess who? An old woman's voice... They just drove by. We'll block the road for you. Message dear. Just a traffic control. Don't worry! Good evening. License and ID. Do whatever they ask. - The car belongs to a friend. - Where are you going? To Diyarbakir. We attended a wedding. This headlight is bad. And your tires seem low! You can't drive like that They're low? Place these. I'll be right back. Mrs. Songul, Dilovan's refusing her milk. Pretty little baby! I'll help you. Come in. - Don't want to eat, pretty girl? - No, she doesn't. I'll show you how it's done. First put your pinkie in her mouth. See... Then, the bottle. The more she drinks, the better. Will one bottle be enough? She'll let you know when she's had enough. Are you here? Which side? I see you. I'm coming. This is the address when you arrive in Istanbul. This is the address in Sweden. Here's your ticket. Only one ticket! And the children? Only one? I don't know... That's all they gave me. Firat! Gulistan! I brought some dinner. Go and set the table, please. - Baby! Did she eat? - Yes. - Did she have a nap? - No. Then I'll rock her to sleep first. - She won't sleep that way. - Why not? Because Dilovan only sleeps when she hears Mom's voice. "Once upon a time, when God was great... there was a little village cursed by a terrible plague. The wolves in the area wouldn't leave the village in peace. At night, they crept in to devour livestock..." Gulistan... Gulistan! Here's some money, dear. 10 million. That should last three or four days. If you need something urgently, go to this address. Aziz will help you. Okay? - Where are you going? - To try and get tickets for you. As soon as I have them, we'll visit Grandfather in Stockholm. To Grandfather's village? - How much did you spend? - Ten million. I'll do that. You watch Dilovan. My heart... my love... Do you know what this is? There are bigger ones, too. We tie bells around the necks of baby goats and calves. Do you need one, too? Why not? It's so pretty... - Mrs. Song Ql's family is moving away. - Where to? I don't know. I just saw them loading up. Leave the TV there. Now put the dresser up. Sister! Look, these clothes belonged to my daughter Berfin. In two months they'll fit your baby sister. Where are you moving to? - To Istanbul. - Why? To work. Take care, precious... Is there nothing left for us? Is Aziz at home? Who are you? What is it? My aunt sent me. Who is your aunt? Yekbun. Aziz is my brother. We haven't seen him for a long time. - When will he come back? - Don't know. Listen... If you see Yekbun, tell her to stay away. The police raid us every day. Run along! Slowly, slowly. Careful. Give me that paper. - I'll pay you 35 million for the lot. - Okay. I'll give you another 15 million for the TV and the tape recorder. We're not selling them. As you want. Hold on! Don't close the door! Is your aunt back? Are you making fun of me? You haven't paid rent in three months. Cemai, please! Don't complain to the kids. Listen, Nazmiye... Their aunt has been gone for two weeks. - Tell it to her when she returns. - How on earth will we pay all our debts? Fine, you've gotten that off your chest. Now let's leave the children in peace. Who knows if she'll even return! - You really think we'll ever see our money? - Calm down. That one. 375. Firat! Firat. Here. Don't cry, Dilovan. Dilovan, please stop crying! Please... My sister is ill. She won't sleep. She has a fever and cries. - How old is she? - She's still a baby. - Is she vomiting? - No, but she's sweating. All right. This syrup, three times a day. As soon as you get home. Understand? 15 million. This is only 8 and a half? That's all I have. Tell your parents that the medicine costs 15 million. I'll pay the rest tomorrow. I promise! This isn't my shop. I can't. But we need the medicine now. Enough! Go get the money. - Good evening, - I have a pain in my throat. - Are you coughing? - Yes. There's no electricity. How's Dilovan now? She cried until she finally fell asleep. - What did the pharmacy give you? - Nothing. Why? I didn't have enough money. Dilovan... You know we love you! And you love this rattle. I'll leave it here for you. Dilovan, my love... You want cookies? Firat, what are you waiting for? Come in. It's very dark in here... And it stinks. Tonight we'll sleep here. Sleeping here is better than sleeping outside. Look, here are some cartons. We can use them to sleep on. Come on, Firat. Please, Firat... No, thanks. Do you know the big shopping mall? Take these cards and put them on the cars. Do it and I'll pay you. - When will you give us the money? - After the work is done. Now go. I'll wait here for you. Hurry up. What's written on the papers?

Watch me with these tissues. - Need some tissues, ma'am? - No. Please, ma'am, please, ma'am... I said no. Please, ma'am. A gift for your sister or brother! For the love of God, please, ma'am. Ah, right. See how I did it? Now it's your turn. Firat, a lighter costs 500. Gulistan, tissues are 500. Go for it! If somebody asks you if you're in school, just say yes, okay? You go that way and I'll go there. Tissues, sir? Mister? You son of a bitch! How dare you call me, you shit! I'm going to kick your ass. Shut up! Need a lighter, mister? Please, mister... Hey, boy!

My brother, my father and my mother were asleep in the same room. Mikail got very scared that night. He still has nightmares about what he saw. Where were you that night? How did you escape? I was at my grandfather's. They burned his house down, too. But we managed to escape. Here's the soap. Wash up! Come in. This used to be an Armenian church. What happened to it?

All the village men got weapons and started hunting for the wolf. They eventually spotted the big bad wolf! As some aimed to quickly shoot it, an old man shouted "Lay down your weapons!" The others were so surprised. The old man climbed down from his horse. He took a piece of meat out of his bag... and slowly, slowly approached the big bad wolf. The old man carefully put the meat in front of the wolf. While the wolf ate, the man tied a bell around its neck. Then he stepped back slowly. The wise old man jumped on his horse and said: 'Let's go!' Everyone was puzzled. 'Did we come here to feed the wolf? Why don't we kill it?' But the old man said: 'No. This wolf will never ever harm anyone again. Whoever hears the bell can run away.' From this day on, the wolf desperately roamed around. Whenever the wolf approached sheep, the ringing woke the shepherd. When the wolf approached a deer, it would run off to safety. Days passed and the wolf grew hungry... Hungrier and hungrier. Then, one day, the wolf fell near a rock and died of starvation." What are you doing? Go away! - Buy a tissue? - Hold on. Buy one, please. 3-6-22. Yes, this is Dilara. Right now? Okay. Where?
