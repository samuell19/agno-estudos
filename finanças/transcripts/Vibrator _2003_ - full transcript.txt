A Vibrator Production Committee Presents March 14th? Japan's extra Valentine Will your boyfriend buy you chocolates? The day for men to show their love Don't be fooled by the hype, you morons! What did I come here for? Wine? White, white wine Not French, but German So sweet! Wine, wine? So sweet, so fine! Why is there no red German wine? They must make it But it's usually white Almost always Madonna, lovely Madonna Why is there no red German wine? They must make it But it's usually white... Shut up! What must people think of you? They can't think you're normal A secretary after a party? No, a secretary doesn't dress like this Much too casual, or am I worrying too much? I want to touch someone But sometimes I need a reason I'm scared of people I can't touch And I'm scared of people who don't know how to touch When I feel threatened I become threatening My self-defense instinct is so strong I'm worried I might kill someone What did I come here for? Wine? Booze is my friend It helps me sleep The voice of my conscience or other people's voices... They melt away when I drink I fancy some aniseed vodka but there's none Alcohol and eating disorders are rife but they're not in the magazines Teenage gangsters? That I can relate to I knnow how the girls on smack feel They're nno different to me Even they want boyfriends But what about me? Am I completely alone? You can feel it, can't you Those subtle changes under your skin Many women experience skin damage But it isn't simply decay! It's caused by an imbalance It isn't your fault You're not withering! Oh, please! "Are you tired?" "Is your skin too dry?" "Did you gain weight?" "Are you losing weight?" Look at the bags under your eyes Frustrated? Are you getting any? You never hear men talking like this Why do women have to listen to this crap? I don't care I'm me Maybe it's too late to do anything about it Let's get ice cream Looks Like a fisherman Tasty, though! I want him Good enough to eat! I wonder what shampoo he uses Smells nice Take me, take me! I'm still alive Where are you? I know it's you Never mind whistling, come and get me! I have to go to him I have to satisfy my appetite Grab that handle Welcome Were you watching me? From way up here? Not all the time I thought you weren't coming Drink?

How about you? 28 I thought you were younger You were buying wine and gin Some friends are coming this weekend But I don't need it yet It's only Wednesday... No, it's Thursday Do you want to watch TV? OK I'm afraid someone complained about the noise of your truck's engine But it's freezing? I suppose you can't turn it off Is there a park or something near here? I've got a morning delivery Mr. Okabe? How do you say your first name? It's TAKATOSHI It's a bit unusual You can park behind the station Do you mind moving? OK Thanks So you get along with policemen We're both just doing our jobs How long have you been a driver? About 7 years And before that? Building contractor's office Then I bought my first truck, and now I do pickups with this one Pick ups? Like freelance But why be a truck driver? I've got no diplomas I hardly even went to junior high So much for compulsory education If I'd graduated junior high I might have got a certificat e But I didn t even attend the ceremony When I first saw you... I was really taken by your boots It's always snowing in Niigata so I need them It only snows a little bit in Tokyo What's special about Nigata? There are lots of furniture factories I go to Shizuoka too But mainly Niigata See that apartment under construction? I'm delivering doors there You leave the engine on all night? Yep Why not use a kerosene heater It causes less oxygen here Well, an electric heater Or a heated rug Then I'd need a generator I want to touch you Be my guest I'm scared Sorry, it sounds stupid I worry someone I don't know might turn nasty on me I'm sorry I don't know why It's ridiculous No one ever hit me You must think I'm an idiot I want to touch you I want to touch you Do you want to come closer? There goes my contact lens You're beautiful Mr. Takatoshi Okabe Do you want to know my name? Just call me Takatoshi Don't make me sad REI. It's Rei Ha yakawa You're beautiful Call me by my name Rei. My ray of sunshine You're so beautiful In what way? Like a rosebud Show me how you touch yourself I can't do that Go on, show me Can you touch your breasts? Suck it I love you, I love you, I love you... Have you got a condom? Make love to me If you do that, I'll come too soon That's OK Liquor and corn chips Nothing else to puke up Take me with you With me? Yep OK With a travelling companion The world smiles upon you Are we going to Niigata No, Kawaguchi Kawaguchi? I have to load some tires Can't run empty Do you find the work yourself? No, a company assigns it I thought it was your own business It's not like being an employee But it's easier to get the right papers if you sign on under a company All of these? Of course it's all of them Here Put this behind you Show me your dick No, it's soft So what? I'll show you when it's hard Why? To see it at its best Hard or soft, it's still you Are you serious? Love me, love me, love me... Are we off to Niigata now? Yep On the expressway? No, we only use regular roads If we use the expressway we have to pay ourselves I see I know you said you want to come with me... Yeah...? Actually, I'm married So? I don't care But there was a little hesitation there! I was once with a girl who ended up nearly stalking me In fact she's never given up It's a bad situation And she's so intense What do you do? Me? I write Articles for magazines and stuff Do you work for a company? Freelance A bit like me So you only get paid if you write? What's so good about truck driving? It doesn't tie you down Well, now the economy is in trouble But before it was easy money Freelance truckers used to carry smack hidden in frozen tuna You couldn't ask a big company to carry stuff like that The dirver must be someone you trust They get to know you through friends of friends And they make sure you're all above board If not the goods could end up stolen The stuff arrives frozen somewhere in Kyushu Even the sniffer dogs can't find it when it's frozen After it comes ashore the dealers step in By dealers I mean the Yakuza And they tell me where to take it They pay for the expressway I got 500,000 cash When I get to the drop off I hand the stuff to the customer Do they tell you what you carried? Yeah, they say do you want cash or do you want the smack I took the cash I don't do smack Do some people choose the drugs? Of course A lot of the Kyushu truckers do It helps them stay awake on the road When did you get married? 3 years ago Any kids? Yep Boy or girl? Girl Is she cute? We're not so close I'm hardly ever home Is that so... Not very often Haulage jobs come one after another so they clash with going home You call it "haulage" That, or "on the road" If you make a round trip you're in Tokyo half the time Where do you stay? There's a place at the company HQ But I hardly ever go there My truck is my house What do you call this space? That's the bunk Can I try it? If you want You can really stretch out here! It has to be big enough for me I suppose your stalker knows that you're married Makes no diff erence, she's in a world of her own "I'm the only one who understands you" Who does she think she is? Someone always on the move like me can't figure out a person like that I might meet someone really cool here but then someone in Sendai Then I might go to Kyushu and meet an even better person Can I use this? Yep An office worker gets married and that's the only person they see They start fooling around at the office and thats called "an affair" But they don't know anything except work and home I got a call from an ambulance the other day The stupid bitch had slit her wrists! She said she wouldn't get in unless the paramedics contacted me! So I told her on the phone "Go ahead and die" To someone who just slit their wrists? I was the victim! I think she should have put her hands in a bucket of water That would finish her off quicker Did you date her? Of course not Well, I gave her a ride in the truck because she wanted to I thought it might keep her quiet But it made her worse, and she got my phone number and address After that she never stopped calling I was furious so I called her old man And he says 'I'm so sorry, you can punch her lights out if it'll help" But if I did that I'd get thrown in jail Did you hit her? Certainly did With your fist How else? Where? At her house If you hate her why'd you go there? Watch where you're going, asshole With a travelling companion The world smiles upon you Mount Akagi... Is this Route 17? No, 353 Even at night Maebashi gets jammed because of the traffic lights So we'll go over Mt. Akagi and avoid the crush Any body listening, over? Big Blue hearing you loud and clear We're heading down 353 to Niigata How's the snow looking? Roads are iced over at Numata Radio? Yeah, I want to check the best route This is Northland from Hokkaido That's unusual What? It's hard to pick up signals from so far when the weather's like this Summertime is clearer because the signals bounce off the ionosphere It's amazing They're so far, and yet right here, entering our perception If the signal's strong it sounds even closer And in a good location normal signals can travel miles I said "perception" but he heard 'reception" And if y ou ask "Who's out there? ' You get replies like 'Tokyo Buddy" or "Off-Roader here" all at once What's 'A offroder?" Oh! "Off-Roader" You can choose the strongest signal So someone says ' Go ahead, Tokyo" but there are loads of people And you get a bunch of replies again So you pick out the strongest signal Hey! Narita Sightseer here Good evening to you, Narita Sightseer He's a radio buddy, another driver Why "Narita Sightseer"? It's his handle, a radio nick name But he's a truck driver Yep Northbound on Route 17 Can you hear me, Minakami, over? Merit 5 southbound on Rout e 17, over But why does he use that handle? Most peop e use illegal wavelengths so they can't use their real name Illegal? Up to 0.5 watts is legal Anything else is illegal I use 2 kilo watts! 0.5 watts? Like a walkie-talkie, and very weak Most people use a booster system What other kinds of radio are there? There's Amateur and Personal Such a lot of snow in Tokyo this year It snowed again today Amateur radio is called Ham, right? Yeah, "CQCQ this is 1212" and so on My truck's electrics packed up today The lights, the heater, everythinng I had to use the expressway What does CQ mean? Yeah, but they all start working the minute you go to get them fixed! Some people say it's short for "Seek you" Others say it means "Come Quick" It's the code for finding a buddy I was going to drive the Miitsubishi but it isn't fixed yet Mitsubishi? Yeah, Mitsubish Fuso That happened to me once The ignition key causes a short It's one of their weak points I thought Fuso was a separate company No, it's Mitsubishi Is this truck a Mitsubishi No, Hino Sightseer, it said there's a big party near Akagi Making a rocks lade barrier You better hurry A party? Road construction So it'll be down to one lane More than likely Do you only use the CB? The CB is fun In what way? People strugging for a strong signal It's a bit of a power game Its not the same with Persona Thats just like talking on the phone Hey there, this is a rendezvous with Narita Sightseer Rendezvous? Talking with 3 or more people Who can I hear in the background? Another channel It's stronger than this one They're not so close but the signal's strong Or we might be blocking them Damn! I wish I'd brought a porno mag That guy's a laugh! There's a lot of stuff like that Sounds lik e a drunken conversat on I want to watch you I don't want to go out for the bathroom Just a second Yeah, it's OK It's OK, I was washing the dishes Look, a boat It's a Russian ship Is this a port? Yeah, I have to drop off the tires It's still early Let's get some sleep My body was willing... But my heart was holding back All right then, do it yourself You're wet enough Why are you ignoring me? He noticed I can feel your asshole squeezing I've got a lump in my throat Just like when I throw up my food It's freezing When I worked for the Yakuza I was the boss' assistant I did all sorts of work for them Answering the office phone Checking up on the clubs My pager would ring and I'd go to one of the bars Then I'd squeeze money out of the drunken cust omers How did you put the squeeze on them? First I fooled them into thinking they just needed to pay us of f Then I d take their name card out of their wallet Take a few snapshots of them with some hostess and demand 100,000! Then next time they're out on the town We make use of the photos Threaten them to show the pictures to other people "We know where your family lives" "We're not threatening you" "500,000 will take care of it" That s as far as we'd go When did you leave the Yakuza? I did it less than 2 years It doesn t take long for me to lose interest Then I was a pimp for some call girls That was boring, and we got caught What for? Prostitution What kind of operation was it? The punter sees a flier in a phone box and they call us We ask what kind of girl they want 'OK. Be waiting in the coffee shop' Where we operated the coff ee shop was the Half Moon "The girl will have blonde hair" ' You'll soon recognize her" Then they'd meet Hello Yes, thank you You like her? OK, we'll need a cash advance Remember the time If she's not back after 2 hours we'll have to come and get her We don't want that to happen, do we? It wasn't me who was arrested It was the person below After that I was asked to run a bar But I wanted a proper job You were about 19 then? You said you worked in a building contractor's office That was after leaving school Maybe earlier I wasn't at school much Spent more time in hospital! Did you never sell drugs? No never Did you ever do them? Maybe once or twice But they never did much for me I was out of my tree on glue Ah, a glue head! It wasn't that I liked it Just couldn't give up At that age I had no money for drugs We'd break into the rubber factory and steal 2 or 3 drums of thinners We could sell it for big money You've done it all! You never know what's interesting if you don't try it Mind you, doing glue is a fool's game But I can say that because I tried it What else have you done? What else? Nothing special You're not exactly normal And you? What? What did you get up to? Only drinking and puking up food Puking? People who starve themselves are called anorexic And people who gorge themselves are called bulimic I interviewed one girl and she described herself as "bulimorexic" She would stuff herself and then puke A combination of the two conditions So I asked her why she did it I suppose I have no self-confidence I have a lot of stress and instability That's why I overeat But I don't want to gain weight and be called fat So I started making myself sick I started thinking that if I vomited it wou d be OK in the morning I was so relieved I slept like a baby But I was fooling myself I started drinking to help me sleep That made me gain weight So I started making myself sick It was awful at first But I really slept wel that night You were insomniac? The voice inside my head disturbs me There are three advantages You eat and it tastes good, then puke You'll be slim and sleep well It became a sort of hobby You're strange But I haven't puked since yesterday Please wait at the Half Moon You'll recognize the girl She has bright red hair So they meet You like her? Great! We'll need a cash advance Excuse me, sir I told you we'd come looking if she didn't come back You won't believe what he did Oh yeah? What exactly did you do to my girl? We're not running an S&M club What do you mean It was hard for me too She was saying "More, more!" But you'd know about that Give me the key to the handcuffs This isn't violence I have every right to do this You didn't treat her nicely You didn't keep your promise You understand? Fucking bastard Do you want to go for desert? I'm thinking of giving up the CB Why? I was asked to become a local Club Leader I've been doing it for years and I have a lot of contacts So why not do it? The organizers are all Yakuza It's such a pain Can I have a smoke? They like to all get together Parties at hot springs I can't be bothered They ask "How's things in your neck of the woods?" Who cares? They think they're in ' The Godfather' If I did go I would borrow a truck But they'd all be in Mercedes Dressed in tasteless suits "You look a bit out of place What do you drive?" ' Actually, a truck" "Oh! A trucker?" I can't stand them Let's buy a drink In the summer they go to the beach And the Club Leaders go round letting people have a go on the CB Why do the Yakuza get involved? It's the competition for the airwaves There's power struggles even with CB There are all these fractions And the strongest wins The Yakuza like a finger in every pie They're like leeches Are they people not in the club? Not for CB You have to be a member And everyone is in a different channel People are friendly in my club That's channel 15 Some channels, lik e channel 6, have a kind of inner circle Lots of hardcore members Some people shoot up on the air Their handles are strange too "Nick the Needle" and stuff Can you hear the police? No When I was in a bike gang we stole one from a police car That and a flashing light We sold them to a Nationalist group Hotplate check ahead Thank s for the report I'll make a detour Hotplate check? Weigh bridge checkpoint This is a 4 ton truck but I m carrying 6 A report" means a checkpoint We have to use code words A speed trap is "S meter', a patrol car sa 'panda", stuff like that I see Do you want to try? Pretend you're me How? Use this and no one will know What s this? A voice converter I don't really like them It' s on permanent loan Switch on and put together with the mike But if they don't know who its they'll be worried They'll know by my handle They'll think I'm fooling around What's your handle? "Storm" Go ahead This is Storm I feel like I' ve disappeared Hows it going? Sorry, can't hear you! He was still talking Breaker, breaker Can you hear a really faint signal? What? Can't you hear it?

I'm 31 years old I'm going to be sick Listen, I'm not f eeling so good so I'm signing off Why did you do that? To cut transmission By whistling? There are a lot of methods It stops others from worrying Are you OK? Don't touch me! Can't throw up. How come? I feel like shit I feel hypersensitive So don't touch me Please I feel like shit Stop it I feel like shit It's ready Is it too cold? Just right I've got sensitive skin now I can't stand hot water I wonder... Why this man... Understands me His kindness isn't just sympathy It's the real thing He's even kind when he doesn't feel sympathetic He touches soft things with care Like you would handle a peach Cold shoulders We're like animals Acting on instinct Some people don't know how to handle something softly He's so nice If I stayed with him he'd be mine If I fall in love I'll cry Don't be stupid Who cares about his wife I like him Just let me drown What are y ou doing?

It's so bright That pachinko parlour's closed down Old men having their morning coffee Jesus! Watch where you're walking That was a bit of a shock You should eat You wouldn't want me to be sick again As long as you're not sick in the truck If you don't eat, there's nothing to puke up You're saying things like "It's bright" or "This is route 5" Looking at the people and saying "The old men having morning coffee" I know You'd say those things even if I wasn't in the truck I suppose so So I don't have to answer every time No You said you liked me Yes, I like y ou How about you? Do you like me? Yes, I do You can stay with me if you want Thanks But there's a man waiting in my apartment I told him I was just going to buy wine You're joking He's been waiting all this time?
