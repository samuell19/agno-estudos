EYES THAT SEE You found what we needed. Hello, everyone. OK, fine. Plus zero, comma, four hundred, sixty two, six, dot, fifteen, zero, dot, zero, dot, zero, dot, zero... It's me, sir. Your new assistant. Michaël, I'm not deaf. I heard you knock, open the door and come in. Er... Yes. It could have been someone else. Wearing wedge heel trainers that squeak when you walk? And you say "er" each time you start talking. Look, Michaël. I don't know if you're talented, but you're already quite distracting. Ophthalmologist, calling. Ophthalmologist, calling. Hello? Ah. Hello, Doctor. Professor Landowsky? Really? At least tell me why. Right. OK. Bye, Doctor. Bad news, sir? No idea. You need to change key. Or we don't harmonise. You're right. - Shall I stay where I am? - Sure. OK guys. Take two. Wait. François is here. - The spy with winged feet. - Sorry to interrupt. We're nearly done. Paul's coming to dinner. - He's cooking. - That's good. Hi, bro. Hi, Paul. How are you? - Fine, and you? - Fine. - Will you have a drink? - Yes, please. I wonder why they're still rehearsing. Aren't they ready? This jazz festival has a very high standard. Sautéd veal will do no harm. Will you help me peel the carrots? How's it going with Myriam? Don't tell me it's already over. You know, she wanted us to live together. I'm not ready. Let's change the subject. OK. My ophthalmologist wants me to see Dr Landowsky tomorrow. Who's he? The department head. And don't ask why. I hope it's nothing serious. What are you two plotting? We're just chatting. You're very quiet, for people who are chatting. I heard about keratoprosthesis. I thought it was still being tested. That's true. But we've just improved the technique by reducing the risk of rejection. That's why we have a special protocol. Meaning? We've selected 10 patients on the basis of their records. While most of them have a 60% or 70% chance of success, in your case, the chance of success is 90%. But my cornea has been burnt and opaque since I was 7. You could partially regain your sight. My wife is blind. From birth. I know, I saw her file. Congenital atrophy of the optic nerve. - Inoperable. - Yes. So. Think about it. Talk to your wife and children. You have two, I think. Yes, a girl of 16 and a boy of 10. - Ten? - He was a surprise. One of life's gifts to us. I'll give you two weeks to think about it. OK. It's not long, but you understand, places are in demand. Hello. So? If I do the operation, I've a 90% chance of seeing again. Hell, François, that's... That's the best thing I've heard in 40 years. I can't believe it. - Shall we call Anne right away? - No, Paul. Not so fast. Come. A small step. It's like going back in time, mending things. Chair. It's amazing news, isn't it? Paul, order me a strong coffee, please. How come your skin's so soft? Before she died, Cleopatra told me her secret. What nonsense. - So what if it's nonsense? - So what... I don't see what more I could ask for from life. Do you think things'd have been different between us, if one of us could see? Why do you ask that? I just wondered. I think we'd never have got together. Yes... Clémence is in the Caribbean with her parents, scuba diving. They have monitors for blind people. I'd like that. Yes. Why not next year? I'm up for it. - You're too small. - Rubbish! Lucien, get off that boat. You'll break it. - Mum, I love your cake. - I know. Your girl's beautiful. I wouldn't break it. Never mind the Caribbean, we could walk by the sea now. Have a paddle... Coming, mum? I'll watch you. I can do it any time. Louise is leaving the sea to us. Isn't that kind? - Don't take it with you. - Right. Your husband's touchy. The two of you... So what do you say to that? - You're the strongest. - Right. Bow. You didn't tell me about Anne. - What? - How did she react? She said nothing, because I haven't told her. Hang on. I don't understand. I don't want this operation to disrupt my life. I'm used to being blind. I'm settled. I don't want to risk changes in my life. Don't you want to see Anne's face? Your kids' faces? Clara's growing up. Every day something changes in her. - Don't you want to see that? - It's not that simple. You've the chance not to be disabled. This disabled man wants to be left in peace, OK? The truth is, you're scared of getting your sight back and you won't admit it. You piss me off, Paul. You really do! You don't care about me? The guilt I've felt for 40 years. You don't care? J.-P. points at the sky, looks at his friends cheerfully. He glances at the bill, which is for 5,773 euros. - Isn't it funny? - Sure. - You're not laughing! - Sorry. - You're not listening. - I am. - Something wrong? - No. The possibility of the star collapsing into itself... Its mass... Oh, François. This is Hélène Scott. My assistant, stolen from me by the Hawaii Observatory. I'm honoured, you know. I've read all your work. I'm working on supergiant stars. There's one that intrigues me. Its speed's accelerated, its luminosity is now unstable... An inexplicable anomaly. I've never seen that. That's exciting. Why have you come back to Lille? So you can help me explain the phenomenon. Me? Yes. I'd like to show you my observations. Well? François, what do you say? - Hello, darling. - Hi. - Mum. - What? Your shoes are different colours. - I lost the Colorino. - It's here. Dad brought it down. Thanks, darling. Dark blue. Yes. Red. I'll start a new fashion. Any coffee? Hello, Anne. Paul? François's gone to work. - I came to see you. - Me? I'm sorry. It's really urgent. Urgent? OK. Come in. - Your latest measurements? - Yes. The speed's increasing almost exponentially. That's the mystery. Maybe a giant black hole? Of course, but the star's falling too fast. I've a hypothesis that might help. Show her my work in the file "Black holes and dark matter". Of course. There. A giant black hole surrounded by dark matter? That theory's never been confirmed by observation. Imagine it, if you're right! This could be the death of a star swallowed up by a black hole? Exactly. Our star, swallowed by a black hole. - What a scoop! - No. "Your" star, Hélène. It's your star. ...his two companions moved away, giving room for all these knights who, in a crowd, went to see the boat and what was in it. Hello, darling. What's going on? Why didn't you tell me about meeting Landowsky? Oh, so Paul... The bastard. Why didn't you tell me? Because this operation is a dangerous idea. For who? For us. Don't tell me you don't understand. Listen. I was always blind. I don't know what seeing means, but you... You used to see, you know what it means. Don't you want to get that back? I like our life as it is. I don't want anything to change. You'll regret it. We should at least consider it. Listen, darling, please... I've made my choice. I won't have the operation. There's nothing more to say. - OK? - OK. Go up, quick. That'll be the delivery man. I ordered some wine. Will you get it, Clara? Check there are 6 bottles in the box, sign the slip, and give him this. Clara? I don't want to. I'll do it, Dad. Can you tell me what's going on, Clara? We heard you talk about the operation. I don't agree. - With what? - Dad should do the op. I don't understand. It would be great! Imagine... I imagined and I decided. Sorry, but that's how it is. Come on, Mum, say something. Darling, it's your father's decision. Not yours or mine. François. François. Are you OK? Yes. I was dreaming. I was dreaming. It's OK... - Clara. - Yes? I'm expecting my concert contract. Can you see if it's come? Well? *Saint-Antoine Hospital Ophthalmology Just bills and bank statements. I'll handle the bills tonight. OK, darling. Thanks. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - What's that letter? - It's not for kids. - I'm not a kid. - Shut up, idiot! It's a letter from the surgeon. "During our conversation... Since you haven't replied, "I interpret your silence as declining the operation. "I respect your reasons... "It's a one-off chance to take part in a test "which, given its cost, "will not be repeated for years." What does it mean? That Dad can't change his mind. It's serious. What can we do? We keep quiet. Are you crazy? It's your favourite prelude, right, Julien? - It was. - "Was"? Before my accident. When I wasn't blind. You know, Julien, music is a straight line from your heart to your fingers. You don't need eyes. Forget your eyes. Never mind them. Here. Touch. Touch the notes. Can you feel them? C, E, G, C, E, G, C, E... You know it. You've played the prelude. E, G, C, E... Same again, from the C. Just four notes change. Yes. Go on, Julien. Look. Come on. Come here. Your third finger goes here. Go on. Yes. What's the best sight a telescope offers? - The best? - Yes. The small nebula of Lyra. My favourite. A circle of green smoke with bits of yellow and red. And in the centre a small star shines like a diamond, with blue reflections. Do you know colours? No, it's been too long. I lost my sight in an accident. Playing with my brother. He was clumsy and I got caustic soda in my eyes. François, the timer's gone off. I can't find the switch. I can't help you. François, I can't find it. In the dark, you're the disabled one. Imagine that, for 40 years! Sorry. I had a nightmare. You have them every night. It's not really a nightmare, it's... pictures. Pictures? What do you mean? My father... My mother... Paul in tears after the accident. I'm not sure it's really them. Do you realise what you're saying? What? You never dreamed in pictures. Don't say that. Don't say that. François, for the first time I see how you suffer, not seeing. We can't go on like this. I never realised that, all these years, you still wanted to see. - Stop it. - I don't want this sacrifice. I want you to have the op. Or else... Or else what? You'll stop loving me. But do you realise, nothing will be the same? True, but you won't be like others who can see. Know what I think? If you see, I'll see too. Through your eyes. You'll tell me what you see. You'll be my eyes. Ah, here he is. How is he? Don't worry. - And the op? - The doctor's coming. - You know how it works? - Yes. Bye now. - Bye. - Goodbye. - What's wrong? - Don't worry. Sit down. Thanks, Paul. Hello. Hello, Doctor. It all went well. We'll remove the dressing Wednesday. It hurts. He moaned. He's waking up. - And Wednesday? - If all goes well, he'll have blurred sight till the transplant settles. Wednesday's good. The kids can be with him. That's not a good idea. Your husband will be tired, anxious... They should wait till he goes home. But I'd like to be there. If there's any problem, Anne and François will need me. Yes, that's s good idea. Yes, thanks. If you want, yes. Shit. Shit. Sorry, we'll try again. We'd better have a break. You're not with us. - It's OK. Let's start again. - No, we'll have a break. It's a mistake. It'll be bad if it fails, even worse if it works. Why? It's not the same philosophy. Some mixed marriages work well. Exceptions that prove the rule. 80% of blind people marry blind people. Why does François want to be different? If he can see, it won't change his marriage. - It'll strengthen it. - Why? They'll have weathered this together. I hope you're right. - Stop annoying me. - Sorry. Some things are better left unsaid. Yes. Anne, all that matters is your happiness. Thanks, Alex. Thank you. 12:15 pm. I can't wait any longer. Let's do it. If we're disappointed, it had better be just us. There. Don't move. Thank you. Open your eyes very slowly. There. Count my fingers, please. One, two, three. Perfect. Can you see my face? A vague shape. That's it, I can see you. I can see your face, Doctor. I can see it. It's worked. Hello. Anne? I... No. Hélène. Come close, or he won't see you. Very close. A nurse will put drops in for you. I'll be back later. Thanks, Doctor. I came to give you the whole team's support. Can you see me? Yes. Yes, I can see you. I'm so happy for you. François? Well? If you come a bit closer, I'll finally know how you look. I'll leave you. See you. We're all eager to have you back. Where's Anne? That's why I'm late. At the last minute she broke down... She's waiting for you at home. But she'll call you. Come close, so I can see your face. Come close. Closer, closer. Closer. I can see you. I can see you. My brother... There. - Hurry up! - Done. My turn. Go on, up you go. Be careful. Don't take any risks. - Do you have your drops? - Yes. You must put them in your eyes every two hours. Don't worry, Doctor. You can't buy those drops in the chemist's. If you lose them, call me. OK. You know you don't need that any more. You're right. - Do you feel OK? - Yes. I want to get home. So? Do you think we look the same? I don't know. I haven't seen myself yet. - Really? - No. Go ahead. Oh no, no. It's too soon. It's too soon. Clara, mum! They're here! Lucien! - Clara! - Dad! - Can you see me? - Yes, I can! I'm not little. No, you're big. And handsome! And you, Clara... You were right, Paul. You're beautiful, wonderful! This is amazing, Dad. And your mother? Will you fetch your mother? We did all this, and it's raining. It doesn't matter, Clara. It doesn't matter. - Shall we go in? - Yes. I don't understand. She's not here. She's there. - Really? - Yes. So, you can... You can leave me, now. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Don't you want me to...? - No. Leave me, please. Anne? Say something. You're very beautiful. - I don't believe you. - Why? - I'm sure you're disappointed. - I swear I'm not. Remember when we met? I feel like it's happening again. My heart's beating almost as hard. Mine too. Tell me. Can you see? Everything? Can you see well? Close up, yes. Far away, it's blurred. At the side, nothing. I can see... volumes, colours, shapes, but I... I can't judge distances. It's wonderful. What are you doing? I have to put drops in every 2 hours. - OK? - Yes, fine. You know... I'll need your help to get home. I'll be happy to be your white stick, my love. - You're really not disappointed? - No. No, on the contrary. You're lovely. Don't look at me too much... I will, I will. Tell me. I want to know everything. Tell me... The sky, for example. What's it like? It's blue... deep blue. But what's blue like? What can I say? Blue is a colour that's... - I'd say peaceful. - Yes, that makes sense. - And yellow? - It's joyful, gay... And red? It's a bit garish, really. Ah, more aggressive. Why "white lies"? - OK? - Yes. I didn't see it coming. Keep your blind skills and you'll be the ideal man. - I'm not the ideal man? - You have to work on it. The curves. 293 grams. Oh, the Inca... Oh, wow. So? You're rediscovering the world? I have to touch things. Or I don't know what they are. I knew that your skin was soft, not that it was golden like honey. - Stop it... - What's wrong? We're back. We're back! - Dad! - So? How was the film? - Great! - Really? That's good. We left before the end. Lulu wanted to get home. What's that? Show me your tongue. What's that? A nail in your tongue? No, it's a piercing. It's the fashion. You knew about this? As it's the fashion... What's that noise? What did you do? I turned the lamp on. No, I can't. Really? Forgive me. I'm sorry. Don't worry. We've all the time in the world. Thank you. Will you put the light out, please? Of course. Are you cross with me? Of course not. - Thanks. - My darling... No. Michaël, leave it plugged in. But it's a braille printer. I still need it, till I learn to read. I didn't realise. You're a research director, senior lecturer, and... you can't read or write. Hang on, Michaël. I can read and write, but in braille. Yes, of course. But even so... It's amazing. Right. Go on then, son. Off you go. Thanks a lot. I got the information I requested from Hawaii. - So? - The measurements don't fit. I'm trying to understand. Can you take a look? No mistake. I really can take a look now. It's OK. It's all right. Thanks. - Not hungry? - I used to love red meat, but now when I see this flesh bathed in blood... I'm disgusted. Excuse me. If you don't want it, I'd like it. Sorry, but it's... Thanks a lot. - What a revolution for you. - That's the word. But I have to wait for answers to my questions. What questions? What's mist like? It's always fascinated me. It smells different in autumn and winter, but does it look different? I've never noticed. And is snow all white? No. Snow's amazing, it takes on the colours of its surroundings. It's a bit orange at sunset, bluish when the sky is clear, brownish on top of dry earth. You know what? We won't wait for autumn or winter. We'll save time. Coming? - Thanks. - Not at all. This way. Come. Lille Art Museum I saw a painting for the first time. Incredible! I saw snow in the painting. I could feel it in my hands, under my feet. I almost felt cold. It was amazing! Watch out if you see a Picasso. You'll think your head's crooked. That makes you laugh? Silly. - Hi. - Hi, Paul. How are you? Hi, Paul. Lots of laughs. Your brother's colleague had a great idea: she took him to the art gallery. It's ready. Clara, can you call your brother? Clara mentioned Picasso. Cubism fascinates me. An eye where a cheek should be, a sidewards mouth on a front-facing face... Crazy. - What's fascinating? - The contrast with reality. Shit. My fault. I forgot to close it. Sorry. It won't happen again. Forgive me. - You OK? - Yes. That's us two, right? Yes. Just before the accident. Let me see! Look, that's your dad. And that's me. And that, wait... Our parents at the Villefranche house, in summer. Yes, I remember. Look at Mum. - Notice anything? - Yes. The beauty spot. A little triangle. - Right. - I told you. Can you help me? Don't you think I'm like your mother? Yes. The same shaped face, the same eyes. - Don't you think so, Paul? - Yes, a bit. - Who am I like? - We can't tell yet, Lulu. We'll soon find out. - Right. I'm off to bed. - I'll join you in a minute. Here, look. Wait. Recognize him? Tell me, isn't he... - The neighbour's dog? - Yes. - What was his name? - Pheasant. - Pheasant? - Odd name for a dog. He looked like a pheasant. Don't you remember? "Come here, Pheasant." He could fly too, yes? - I know. - You know what? I know you want the light on. We can make love in the dark till the end of time. - Yes, but you'd like to see me. - Yes. OK. Now? The more we wait, the more I'll panic. So yes. Now. Right away. Are you sure? Yes. - OK... I'll put the light on. - No. No, no, no. That's too strong. - Shall we wait till morning? - No, that's worse. - Well, unless I use a lighter... - Yes! That's good. - A lighter? - Yes. Bit by bit. Well? I didn't know seeing was so exciting. What are you doing? Give me a cigarette. - I deserve one, no? - Yes. Here. There. What's the sky like? Magnificent, full of stars. I've seen your body. And now, the sky... I'm very happy. "'I don't like that', says Mum. - "'We must go to the doctor.'" - I don't want to go. - Hush! - Sorry. "'Why worry?', replies Dad." He's right. "'Lozenges will cure it. "'I'll go and get some from the pharmacy.'" - Wait. Let's see. - What? - Show me the word "pharmacy". - There it is. - There's a mistake. - Where? Ph. - Isn't it with F, like "François"? - No. Well, I say... It's difficult. - I don't know if I can learn. - Don't worry. You encourage me. Already up? So early on a Saturday? I'm teaching Dad to read and write. That's good. This afternoon, we're off to see Picasso. We have to ask Mum. Of course. It's a good idea. No problem. - I'll ask Clara to... - Clara wants to come too. - I told you. - No problem. Where were we? "Little Louis agrees with Dad." "Little Louis... "agrees... "with Dad." "He doesn't want to go to the doctor's." "He doesn't want... "to go to the doctor's." "He prefers cough syrup." "He prefers... "cough syrup." - No. - What? - Mistake. - Why? There's "gh" at the end. - Why is there "gh"? - That's the way it is. OK. I'll write it with "gh". Slight inflammation on both sides. - A sign of rejection? - I hope not. But your eyes are tired. You're asking too much of them. - You're using the drops regularly? - Yes. OK. Nothing serious, but take it easy. You're still adapting. So be careful, don't do too much. I'm counting on you. So we calculate the angular speed of the star's fall. Omega equals d phi over dt by d phi over dt over plus or minus gt phi over g phi. There. Shouldn't g ph be squared? Well done, Michaël. I'm impressed at how fast you've learned to read, even mathematical symbols. My son and you are good teachers. Progressing? At the speed of light. Hawaii confirms our scenario to the last decimal point. The star should disappear in a few days. Great. What about the space telescope? NASA has agreed to focus it on our star. You got NASA to do that? Sometimes we beg them for months. Hélène convinced them. It's a very rare occurrence. The pictures will be seen worldwide. Surely now the research centre will give our lab a loan. It wasn't sure. Oh shit. I didn't know the lab was in such trouble. It's now 9:25 pm. It's me! Sorry. I didn't see the time. I was worrying. Isn't Clara here? She's gone out with friends, and Lulu's asleep. OK. Keep listening. I'll find something to eat. - You turned it off for me? - Well? You seem excited. A big star is being swallowed by a black hole. It'll be a sensation. Brilliant! Did you discover it? No, a colleague. - Do I know her? - No, no. She's come from Hawaii for a few weeks. This discovery's crucial for the lab. You told me a colleague took you to the gallery. Hélène. The same person? Yes, yes. What's she like? Very competent. Is she pretty? Not bad. What's "not bad", to one who can see? Why all these questions? I'm just curious. Before, beauty was an abstract concept for you. But now that... that you can see, it's something concrete. I just want to know how beauty affects you. Take you, for example, your beauty affects me. Here she is. Hi. - OK? - OK? And you? Had a nice evening? What did you do? What's this outfit? What, my clothes? I don't want you going out like that. Everyone dresses like this. Nail in your tongue, bottom exposed... It's not possible. Call me a whore then. When he was blind, he left me in peace! What did you say? Say that again! Hush! You'll wake Lulu. - See how she talks to me? - Why humiliate her? All for a piercing and short shorts. Does sight make you stupid? In these pictures, we see exactly what's just happened 4 million light years from here. The star is pulled off its path, and sucked into the black hole in just a few days. The disc of gas reaches several million degrees, and in the centre, the jet of particles moves at a speed close to that of light. Michaël. - Well? - Well... I say bravo. Bravo, it's an amazing discovery. I did nothing. It's her discovery. François... You did a lot. I couldn't have interpreted my observations. Others would have beaten us to it. What you did was very valuable. The credit's for the lab, and Michaël, our future Einstein. The lab will make headlines. The research centre's delighted, and I hope we'll work more together. We'll mention you in the interviews, starting with Nature, which will have your discovery on its next cover. By the way, François, the Hawaii lab's inviting you for 2 months to study the X rays emitted by the black hole. - When? - Right away. It has to be studied now. You know better than me. Are you tempted by 2 months in an observatory? It was my dream... until now impossible. You'll see. Hawaii's like paradise. That's it. It's an offer I can't refuse. You'll go with your colleague Hélène? Yes, for 2 months, to continue our work. What do you want me to say? Enjoy your life. What do you mean, "enjoy your life"? Nothing. I'm tired. This discovery will transform my career. And open the world's observatories. You're not being fair. Why? Because I regret your operation? Anne, this trip to Hawaii is an accolade for me and the lab. - I can't say no. - Say yes. Anne, please. When are you going? Wednesday. Let me go! My work's not as important as yours, but tomorrow's the last rehearsal. So forgive me but I need peace and quiet, and tonight and the next ones I'll sleep in my study. Shit! Such a nice mood. We must go. See you tonight. OK. Coming? See you later, darling. - Clara. - Yes? - Look at me, please. - What's wrong? Look at me and tell me if I have any grey hairs. grey hairs? No. You don't have any. - Sure? - I swear. Wait. And this, here? Is it a wrinkle? Listen, Mum, when you're old and ugly, I'll tell you, I promise. - Excuse me? - Yes? I'm off. Bye now. - What time is is? - 9:30 pm. I must go. François, I want to show you something. Is your name François, young Michaël? No. No? Bye then. Yes, bye. I'm coming. Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - Oh? - You've set it up? - For you. Come. Where shall we start? M13? Saturn? The Andromeda Galaxy? The moon. The moon. It is now 10:18 pm. François mobile. Calling François. Anne calling. Anne... The Lyra Nebula! Your favourite. You remembered. It is now 11:40 pm. Observatory. Calling observatory. Hello, Karim. It's Mrs Fryedman. My husband hasn't come home. Is he still working? In the dome? Is he all alone there? Miss Scott. Hélène Scott? You gave me a wonderful present. Thank you. You've seen nothing yet. Wait till we're in Hawaii. Hello, darling. Sorry for last night. I got your message late, and you were asleep when I got home. I was given a surprise. Seeing the stars through the big telescope. Amazing. Who gave you the surprise? My colleagues. Bye. - Hello, everyone. - Hello. Hi, Anne. - Hi, Gilbert. OK? - Yes. It's fine. Everything's ready. We even have a visitor. A journalist. Hello. Sorry. Sophie Latour, Musique Première. After rehearsal, I'll interview you, and all the group, if you agree. - OK. - Thank you. Mind the steps... There. Let's go, chick. The sooner we start, the sooner we finish. Call me chick and I'll make you swallow your double bass. There's an energy. Yes, there's energy. Ready? 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. Sorry, it's me. Just a second. We can start again. Florent, take it up right there. No, no, Gilbert! I have the high and low notes, but nothing between. I'm doing my job, honey. I'm adjusting things. Go on then, adjust! Start from where we left off. What's going on now? Am I solo? What's the idea? - You're out of time! - Me? - I'm out of time? - No! If I'm not in time... - What's she doing? - She's leaving. - Anne... - Leave me alone. Let me go! Let me go! Anne... Anne! What are you doing? And the journalist? Who cares about the journalist? - We haven't finished. - I have. OK, Gilbert? Oh, shit. You get on my nerves. Alex? I'm here. I'm here. Are you feeling that bad? - Let's go. - No. The adjustments. Gilbert will sort it out, with Florent. Come on, let's go. You were right. It's difficult. We don't share anything now. He shares with others... I was sure it would happen. I'm sad to be proved right. Thanks, Alex. For what? For being here. I've always been here for you. You know that? Yes, I know. If you like, we can go boating. That always causes a stir, a blind person hiring a boat. I love seeing the guy's panic. He can't say no, it's not politically correct, but he panics. He thinks: "Oh dear. "He'll go off course. "I'll have an accident to deal with. "Does the insurance cover blind people?" Of course I put it on. I pretend to fall getting in the boat, wave my arms around... It's great fun, believe me. Fancy trying it? Anne? Anne? Anne? You're nasty. That's nonsense. I'm not nasty, it's true. I can see the difference. She doesn't bother about us any more. She won't bother me about clothes. It's not true. - You're the spoiled baby. - I'm not a baby! - He's going away for 2 months. - Where? Hawaii, for his work. You know that. Hi, darling. Already back? Was it OK? Ready for Sunday? Grandma called. She fell in the stairs, she got 3 stitches. - What? - That's all, nothing broken. She's back home. - How was she on the phone? - Normal. Mum, what happened? Yes, I'm worried. Of course I am. I'll get the 6:00 pm train. Don't argue, I'm coming. It's a fuss about nothing. The day before your concert, you didn't need this trip. - If you say so. - Yes. Watch out, there's a step. I'm here. Wait. So that's nothing? It's nothing. 3 stitches is nothing to worry about. - What? - It's you who's not OK. I'll say no more. - Mum, please... - Go on, get in. I'm closing the door. We'll go to Jeannette's for dinner. - Take my bag. - Oh, great. - Is there some sun? - Now and again. Jeannette, that was delicious. - As usual. - Take care. - Thanks. - See you soon. Bye, Jeannette. It's good you came. For once I can have you all to myself... - So do you feel better now? - For the moment. Meaning? Mum, this house is too big for you. The stairs are dangerous. This time you're OK, but next time... - You should sell it. - And live where? In an apartment. In town, with a security guard. At least you'd be safe. The only one who can keep me safe is your father. And your father's here, in this house. All around me. If you think I can leave your father among strangers... No way, my girl. - Why don't you talk about yourself? - There's nothing to say. - How are things with François? - Don't want to discuss it. It's complicated. Don't look like that. - What's the star's weight? - Ten times our sun's. It's mindboggling. We're used to that. One in Hawaii, the other in Lille. How did you meet? Sorry, you have an urgent call. Can't you see I'm busy? Your wife... had an accident. Well? She's out of danger. What happened? I only know she went beyond the buoys. She never did that, even as a child. I'll go and see her. May I? Go on, but take it easy. She's exhausted. Where am I? In hospital. Do you remember what happened? The current was too strong. I didn't realise. I was scared. I was so scared. You can't imagine... - Here, Mum, I've made some tea. - No, thanks, darling. - Sure you don't want anything? - No. Come here. Come, I... I need you. I just want to feel you near me. I don't like seeing you like this. Don't worry. It's nothing. It'll pass. - I hope so. - Yes. She'd never have gone so far by accident, right? I don't know. I shouldn't have had the op. Or flirted with your colleague. What? Hélène and I have a professional relationship. Stop it, François. Not with me. You think I don't know? That's nonsense, Paul. - Nonsense? - Yes. You have a night stargazing, then follow her to Hawaii. You're annoying me, Paul. - I tell you it's nonsense. - I tell you to stop. I'll admit something. You always beat me at judo because I let you win. Not any more. Hélène, can I have a word? Yes. What's up? I'm not coming to Hawaii. I'm really sorry. I know how important the project is for the lab. I'd be grateful if you'd take Michaël as assistant. He'll represent me. Of course, we can still continue to work together by email. Did I do something wrong? No, you did nothing wrong. Far from it. So? You're beautiful, competent. You understand me. We share the same passion for our work... You affected me. But I love my wife very much. And now I may lose her. I have to make a choice, and I'm making it now. I'm asking you to understand me and forgive me. And I'm asking you to leave me alone. - Excuse me, sir... - Michaël, not now. Landowsky, calling. Answerphone I'm so ashamed. Of what? Of taking a swim at the wrong time or messing up the concert? Both. That's what insurance is for. We'll do Berlin in 2 months. We won't miss Berlin, Anne. Agreed? Agreed. Florent, fancy a cigarette in the garden? Now you mention it... - Why did you do it? - Do what? You're right, there are many things. Why did you leave my place? Why didn't you give call me? Why that accident, at rehearsal time? Why didn't you leave François? Why are you running away? Is that enough, or shall I go on? I don't have many answers. Give me what you have. Listen, Alex, I'm sorry I ran away from your place like that. I was ashamed. I didn't sleep with you for love or desire. I was just lost, and you were there. Understand? I don't know if I'll leave François. Whether I do or not, what happened between you and me will never happen again. Fuck. Thank God you didn't have all the answers. - Have I hurt you? - Well... you left me a good memory. Thanks. Stop it. That's enough. - Why not? Between friends... - No, stop it. François, this is Landowsky. I left messages on your mobile. You didn't come on Monday, or today. What's more, you must be out of eye drops. Call me back. You're taking foolhardy risks. You have one message. Message deleted. How about renting a riad in Marrakech? I've found something quite cheap. So cheap that I can pay my share. - OK. Forget Marrakech. - No. It's a good idea. It'll be a change from the beaches here. - I'd like it. - Me too, I'd like it. - We'll be all together. - Yes. No, as your father will be in Hawaii. I'm not going. Michaël will help Hélène, and we'll work by distance, by email and video conference. - You gave up your project? - Yes, I told them this morning. I think you should have told me first. I wanted to give you a surprise. Mum, he wanted to surprise you. That's cool. I'm off to bed. I'm still very tired. - Are you getting divorced? - Why do you ask? You don't love each other. Your mother thought I loved her less. I disappointed her. - Do you love her less? - No. I promise it'll all be OK. How do you know? I'm going to prove how much I love her. Time to go to sleep now. - When I've given Paul a kiss. - Yes. I'll fetch him. Oh. You're here? Are your eyes OK? They look very red. No? Put your drops in. Yes, you're right. Hi, little man. Stop it. Right... I'm off now. Please could you bring me my red Indian shawl from our room? Your red Indian shawl? Sure. Thanks. It's working. Is this my red shawl? Isn't that what you wanted? Yes. Yes. François, my red shawl is made of wool. My blue shawl is silk. What I'm touching now is silk. You're going blind again, right? I threw my drops away. Why did you do that? - So we could be like before. - Before? Yes. But I never asked you to give up your eyes. - Why did you...? - Because I love you. I don't want you to doubt me. I miss you, I miss you... I miss you. I miss you too. Professor Landowsky. Call Landowsky. What's...? You did the right thing. - Where is he? - Here. Come with me. François, you've been very stupid. What are you doing here? Can you explain? Anne? You wanted to prove your love for me. I understand, but I don't want this proof. What, then? Can you save his eyes? I don't know. It's too soon to tell. I want you to be able to see. I just want to find my place in your life. You can talk later. I'll take you now. My love... You'll see, it'll be fine. Mum? What's going on? A problem with your Dad's eyes. Look after your brother. I'm going with him. Don't know for how long. - Your presence is not necessary. - Try and stop me. I'm with you. Will Dad's eyes be OK? Don't know. We must believe. My little Lulu, they still love each other. I'm not little. - What are you then? - A kangaroo. A kangaroo's big. It can't be small. - I'm a big kangaroo. - Yes, yes. That's right. Subtitles: Eclair Media
