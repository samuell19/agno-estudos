(film whirring) (exalted music) (cacophonous music) (exploding) (gunshots firing) (man grunts) (men screaming) (gunshots firing) (men screaming) - This village is the perfect location for our new missile base. It's centrally located within striking range of our prime targets. Now KGB command wants that village secured immediately. If not for those damn guerrillas, I would've succeeded by now! - General Karpov, they don't call themselves the Untouchables for nothing. It's too damned hard to locate them. - General, are we any closer to locating their headquarters? - No, Simmons, we are not, but I did find out where their financial backing is coming from. A Mr. Johnson is coming to the village tomorrow. - It's a good chance for us. - Yes, after tomorrow they won't be playing cat and mouse much longer. Let's see how far they can get without any financial support. - General, I'd like to lead a squad to handle the bank. - No, that won't be necessary. I've already told Orson to take care of things. I think he can handle it. For the time being, we just sit back and wait for the results. (glorious brass music) - Well Sergeant, anything? - No, sir. - Good. Have something to eat. (march-like brass music) - I don't know, not great here yet. - Yeah, we have to keep looking. - Later. - Mm. (cows mooing) (people cheering) - Hey, Domingo, how's it been, huh? You're looking well-fed. I gotta talk to you later on. We got a lot of catching up to do, don't we? So see you later on, huh? - Okay. - I'll talk with you soon. - Hey, you don't remember me? (laughs) - Of course I do. I just didn't recognize you with that thing on your head. - You forgot me, didn't you? - Yeah, see ya. - Okay, catch you later. - Okay, bye. - Domingo, how are you? - Mr. Johnson, hi. - How's it going? - Very well. - Real nice celebration. - Too bad it's only once a year. - Yeah, I know. Get ready of the oxen and we'll go have a drink and talk for a while, okay? - Sounds real good. Juan, here. Take care of these for me, will you? - [Juan] Yeah, no problem. - All right, go. - Hey Domingo, see you later! - Okay, so long. (suspicious music) - I still have to find a place to stay tonight. - Wait here, I think I know someone who's got a room. (unfriendly music) - Mr. Johnson, you're not welcome around here. - [Man With Hat] We're not gonna hurt you. Just move. Go on. (dangerous music) (gunshots firing) (woman whimpers) (gunshots firing) (crowd shouting) (frantic music) (grunting) (gunshots firing) (man screaming) (frenzied music) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (gun clicks) (exploding) (gunshots firing) (man screaming) - Commander, I haven't seen you for a long time. How are things going? - Hm, not bad. Some trouble though. You know, Karpov struck us, and this time he has kidnapped Johnson! - That Karpov, he knows what he's doing. Without someone to support you financially, you can't go on fighting for much longer, can you? - [Commander] Well, Brian, that's why I called you in. We can just neutralize Karpov's operation, then we have a good chance of maintaining the balance of power in the region. - I think it's too late to save Johnson now, but I'll see what I can do about Karpov. Sounds good? All right. (threatening music) (gun clicks) (gunshots firing) - You sure? Johnson's been killed? You men are useless. - But that guy Kent turned out to be Orson's man! He's the one that killed Johnson. - That Karpov is real clever. Let's hope that Brian O'Riley can deal with him. - [Curly] Brian O'Riley? - [Commander] Brian O'Riley is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran. After the war he became a member of the Elite American Force. His skills in guerrilla warfare and martial arts are unsurpassed. Given the choice, he prefers to work alone, although for particularly dangerous and complex operations, he will call on his longtime friend, the White Tiger. (exaggerated music) - Be careful! (aimless music) (Brian shouts) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (Brian screams) (men grunting) (stabbing flesh) (man cries out) - Huh? (rapid whooshing) (Brian grunts) (man groaning) (mystified music) - Curly, here's your relief. Domingo, this is your first night's duty. I do hope you will try to stay alert tonight. - I will, sir. - Hey Domingo, you better not fall asleep. - Don't worry, Curly, I won't. (Domingo yawns) (mischievous music) (thudding) (grunting) (chilled percussion music) - Domingo, don't worry about last night. - Thank you, sir. - There's your new partners. Patrolman Lemur and Patrolman Agastor. This is Domingo, your new partner. Show him around and teach him all the routines, okay? - [Lemur] Nice to meet ya. - Hello. - Hi. - All right, boys, you try and teach him everything you know. (sneaky music) - No one here. - Nothing. - Hold it! (mysterious music) (men chattering) - Yeah, I hope so. (suspenseful music) Here. (men screaming) - You have been seen with a member of the Untouchables. What do you know about them? Talk! - Nothing! (man moans) - No! (gunshot fires) (man cries out) - Please, you are mistaken! - Am I now? You better talk if you want to live. (man cries out) - Don't shoot! (dreadful music) - One. (gunshot fires) (men scream) (gunshots firing) (thrilling music) Over there! - Yeah! (gunshots firing) (clattering) (man cries out) (body thudding) (gunshots firing) (galloping music) (moves into tense music) - Don't worry, I finished him off. - Now that's being really considerate of you. - Don't worry about it. (Brian laughs) (old man gasping) - Hey! Hey! - I'm not working for Cobra! You're mistaken, mistaken! Please stop, please stop! Let me go! (grunting) Honestly, I hate the Russians! I wouldn't work for them! Please listen to me! You're mistaken, let me loose, please! Let me go, let me go! - Shut up! - Hold it, you men! - Get out of the way! - Listen, this has nothing to do with the police! If you know what's good for you, you better just leave us alone. You understand what I'm saying to you right now? So get out of here. This guy works for Karpov. He's ours! And we'll take care of him! - Let him go! Every man is innocent until proven guilty. Don't take the law into your own hands. - You're helping the enemy! Is that all you're good for? - You know better than that. You're only assuming that he works for Karpov. He probably loves this country as much as you do. Try thinking about that! - Just let him go and there'll be no trouble. The police will handle the investigation. - And you policemen, you're not doing much for this country. Have you thought about that? The Russians, do something about them! Why don't you drive them out? Don't just talk now. Because talking will never be enough to do any good. Let him loose. Come on! (unfriendly music) - Thank you. Thank you very much. - To have all of you present here is a pleasure, General Karpov. - Orson, I didn't come here to socialize, although I do want to congratulate you for doing away with Johnson. You handled that very well. The main reason I'm here is to warn you about Brian. - Do you mean O'Riley? I've heard about that guy. I think our men should be able to take care of him. - Don't be overconfident. He's the best in his field, a special agent from America. Don't think too lightly of him. Now the gun deal is set for tomorrow night, right? - Everything is set for tomorrow night. With more guns coming in, soon the Untouchables will be quite finished. I can assure you of that. - Good. (motor roaring) (energetic music) - Is it all clear? - Oh yeah, come in, come in! Right over here. (exciting music) - You better check them out. - Hm. (thrilling music) Okay. (high-spirited music) - See ya later. - Yeah. Come on. (energetic music) - You two, hold it! What was in that box that you delivered back there just a minute ago, huh? - Hey buddy, it's none of your business. - You're wrong about that! It is my business! - Oh, a tough guy, heh? Mario. - Tough guys don't usually live very long. (gunshots firing) (men grunting) - All right, you're coming with me. Move! - Okay. All right. - Well now, is everything here? - Yes, boss. - Domingo? - Sir? - What's the story on these two? What happened to them? - Rotten cops. I caught them dealing in stolen weapons, and they resisted arrest. - Oh really? Nice work, Domingo. - Thank you, sir. - And their contact? - I saw him too. - Get these two to talk, right away! - Right. - Move! Rotten bastards! - First, Mac was killed! Then Orson's men were captured while making that gun deal! We must be more vigilant! - General Karpov, it was Brian O'Riley who killed Mac. - I know that. Things have become more complicated now that the Americans have decided to interfere. - I don't understand why they only sent one agent. - Because that one man can do more damage alone than 20 men together. Simply put, he's the best! - We have to get rid of him then. - Good idea! Of course we have to get rid of him, idiot! Hugo! - Yes, sir? - Arrange it! - No problem. - Now Samson, I want to send a squad in to take care of those cops. We must teach those villages who they're dealing with. - Yes, sir. - Hm. (menacing music) - Listen! We've heard that you people are supporting the cops and the Untouchables! You'll have to pay for that! (troubled music) - Watch them, men! (gunshots firing) (men screaming) (warlike music) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (body thuds) (wild music) (gunshots firing) - Major Regas. Captain Enriquez. The victims include my wife's kid. The culprits are policemen. - That true? - Yes, I have witnesses to prove beyond doubt it was Domingo Yona and his two police companions who caused all the slaughter, who mercilessly massacred and gunned down those poor defenseless villagers. - I'm sorry about what happened. I'll personally look into this case. Legal action will be taken against Domingo and his partners if what you say is true. - No, no long investigation. I have witnesses here. Pat? - All right, we're ready now. - Bring them here. Major, Captain, this is my administrator, and they are my witnesses. - All right then. Mr. Orson, now I want to assure you that I'll handle it. Any wrongdoers will be punished. It's a law. I assure you, the police force and the military are here to serve you. Captain, see that appropriate actions are taken against Domingo and his men. (blasting) (gunshots firing) - Ow! (man groans) (gunshots firing) (men shouting) (man groans) (knocking on door) - [Domingo] Agent, open up! - Coming, coming. Hey, Domingo. What's the matter? - My partner is hurt. - Oh my god, how did it happen? - It's not too bad. - Let me get you something for it. Come and sit down. And close the door. (enthusiastic music) - You're Brian O'Riley, if I'm not mistaken. - And you are? - I am your worst nightmare. - I guess Karpov sent you to kill me, huh? - That's right. You don't look so tough to me. - Don't judge a book by its cover! You'll be needing some weapons. (zealous music) (grunting) (whooshing) (Hugo screams) (thudding) Hm, what a useless guy. (wrathful music) - Let's rest here for a while. An army patrol! Everyone get down, quick! (bewildered music) Get down! (crazy music) - You just joined us! Who are you to order me? - I'm not ordering you around! Listen to me! I just don't want you to get killed, that's all! If you stand up, you'll draw their fire! And not only that, they'll know our position! And we're in a bad position right now! We're not prepared for a fight! Let's not argue about this now! Easy! Get down! Okay, if that's the way it's gonna be, when we're moving, you're dead. Stay cool! (weird music) Listen up. Bessie, Hannah, you know what to do. Everything goes according to plan. - Yes, sir, Commander. - Gary, Allen, we'll split into groups as planned. All right, let's go. And good luck. - Domingo, I'm sorry about what happened before. - Don't worry about it. - My friend, listen. You were right. You saved my life, and I owe you. (serious music) - Domingo! These are for you guys. - Army clothes, huh? - Yeah, nothing but the best for us out here! These are latest style! (laughs) - Any bullet holes? - No. - Very good. (laughs) Okay. Here. (unpleasant music) - Listen, Orson. You should've gotten rid of this ex-cop Domingo Yano before. Now that he's joined the Untouchables, it won't be easy for you to locate him. - [Orson] But he's a nobody, General! - Don't give me that shit! If he's a nobody, how can you explain what happened to him? Now, locate them and finish the fucking Untouchables once and for all. - [Orson] We'll do that, General. - Good! Hugo's death should prove to us once and for all that O'Riley is not to be taken lightly. Samson. - Yes, sir? - Go tell Nero to finish him off, and don't make the same mistake as Hugo. - I won't. - Hey, hold it! Slow down there! That's it. Hm. (foreboding music) - Karpov sent us. - Yes, sir. It's okay, let them through! - Thanks, sir. - Come on, quick! (sparse music) - So you see, that Domingo is not a problem at all. (creepy music) - But Karpov is getting angry with us! - We'll think of something. (random music) - Orson's right over there. (dumbstruck music) - Isn't that Brian O'Riley? - Karpov will get him. (booming music) (gunshots firing) (men groaning) - Okay, let's get rid of the jeep now. We'll take the boat from here. Right here's fine. - Where is it? - Just over there. There's a guy there, and he's waiting for us. You ready? - Yeah. - Come on then. Up. Come on. There you go. Yeah. - Come here. Hm. There you go. (uncertain music) - Hello there, Sam? - What's up? - Sam, we need to use your hut for a little while, okay? - Why sure, come on in. (laughs) - Come on. Hurry up. Come on up, quickly. (dramatic music) (feverish music) (determined music) (exploding) (gunshots firing) - Hey! (gunshots firing) (thrilling music) (man screams) (thudding) (weighty music) (ominous music) - Excuse me, is your boss here? - He's inside. Tell Mick someone wants to see him. What's up? - It's Untouchables. Great news. (suspenseful music) - Yeah, what is it? - The Untouchables are at my place. I just left them. - Good work, my friend. Listen, you two. Get some men together. We're gonna have a war. All right, come with me. (water flowing) (mystical music) (gunshot fires) (people screaming) (malicious music) (gunshots firing) (people crying out) (splashing) (exploding) (gunshots firing) (splashing) (man screams) (gunshots firing) (man grunts) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (gunshots firing) (man groans) - Congratulations, you're very brave. - I thank you very much. - You're welcome, but don't let it go to your head. Pride causes carelessness. Carelessness causes death. I'd hate to see that happen. - I'm aware of that. - Even though Wilson is dead, your work is far from finished. There's so much wrong in this country, so many evil men, and it's your duty to put a stop to it all. - I believe in our country's future. - I know you do. Just keep up the good work. - Congratulations! Everyone's proud of you. You know, you have that quality of fearlessness and great dedication to duty that everyone should have. - Thank you, Commander. - I'm very satisfied with the way you've been handling things, Domingo. Listen up, people! Attention! I am now making Domingo a commander! Commander Domingo! - Long live Commander Domingo! - [Everyone] Domingo! Domingo! Domingo! - I take this oath. - [Domingo] I take this oath. - To fight for the cause of righteousness. - [Domingo] To fight for the cause of righteousness. - And my life will now belong to all of the people. - [Domingo] And my life will now belong to all the people. - I will not rest until evil has been totally destroyed! - [Domingo] I will not rest until the evil's been destroyed. - From now on. - [Domingo] From now on. - All that I ever want. - [Domingo] All that I ever want. - Is what the people want. - [Domingo] Is what the people want. - Congratulations, Commander. A symbol of your leadership. - Don't worry, sir. I won't let that happen. I will. That was Moscow. They're not happy at all about the situation here. - If it was just the Untouchables, things would be simple, but the American agent! - Brian O'Riley has been on our blacklist for too long. It's time we crossed him out. - But we don't know where he is. - I think we don't need to look for him! I have been checking his files, and if I'm not wrong, he'll be coming soon for us. - In that case, we should prepare for him. - Yes, notify the welcoming party. - Yes, sir! (ominous music) - They're in that house. - Commander, an army patrol's coming for us! - Goddammit to hell! - Now we better get out of here real fast. - All right, we'll go to the hideout. (fretful music) (knocking on door) Okay, men, it's safe now. You can all come out. (knocking on door) - Is the commander here? - He's not here, come in. - We have a very important message for him. - He's needed at headquarters right away. - I'll see that he gets the message. - Okay then, we'll be going now. - See ya. (emotional music) - The end has come. I can't carry on. No one can escape death, so I die without yet completing the work. (croaks) All of you must, must continue. (croaks) Domingo, you must take on the command. - I won't let you down, Commander. I'll carry on for the cause. That I can promise you. Don't worry about anything now. - Thank you, Domingo. If you need help, ask the American O'Riley. He'll help you. Don't, don't be too proud to ask for his help. - Don't worry, Commander. Domingo will lead us to victory. You can rest easy knowing that. - I'm sure he'll lead you to victory, and now you must give him all the support that he needs to reach the goal. Work together, because your strength lies in all, not just only in one man. History has shown it to be true. (sad music) (gunshots firing) (people screaming) (vigorous music) (exploding) (gunshots firing) (men screaming) (surprised music) (moves into perplexed music) (gasping for air) - The police killed our men last night. They're working together with the military. I don't know why, but lately they've really been trying hard to get us. - Maybe we should go somewhere else. - Think so? - We can't go on hiding and running scared. - Commander. We in the military shouldn't be fighting each other. It's plain wrong. - I know that, but I also know that we didn't instigate the action against them. We'll all continue just as we are. We're the Untouchables. They won't find us. We're still safe. - You keep thinking like that, then we're all in trouble. Come to your senses. Anyone opposed to us should die, including the army! - Be careful of what you say. Karpov and the Communist Rebels are our only enemies. Haron, your problem is that you assume too much. Not doing you any good at all. Understand? The commander told us to work together. Don't go astray from the group, because in unity is our strength. - Things have changed, Domingo. Ever since the commander died, now we just sit around on our asses all day. That's no way to fight the enemy! - Enough! You cannot fight successfully without a plan and without the opportunity to fight. Four years now we've been fighting. You want it all to go to waste? If you want to be the hero that dies, be my guest, but I hope that you're not that stupid. (water flowing) (sneaking music) (White Tiger screams) (grunting) (whooshing) - You've still got it, Tiger. - So do you. - Yeah. I guess you know why I'm here. - Who is it this time? - [Brian] Dmitri Karpov. - [White Tiger] That bastard. He's a real menace to mankind. I'll be happy to help you. - [Brian] Thanks. I knew you would. - [White Tiger] (laughs) What are friends for? - [Brian] Yeah. (laughs) (water flowing) (foreboding music) - This time we're gonna do it my way. - Are you sure that we're doing the right thing here? Huh? - Come on! - No! Shit! (gunshots firing) (people screaming) (serious music) (gunshots firing) (people screaming) (splashing) - What are you doing? You murdered the man! And now you're dead too! And you took your brothers with you! We in the army are fighting for the same cause! Damn you! (gunshots firing) He did a stupid thing. Now we're really gonna be hunted. We're not safe here. Right now we must relocate. Get everyone together! (abrupt music) - Commander, grenade! (people screaming) (exploding) (Domingo cries out) Commander, are you okay? - Yeah. - You were hit! Commander! (weighty music) - What happened? - It's Domingo. - Are you sure? - Yeah, they ambushed us. (groans) (wondering music) - He should be all right after he gets a good rest. Hope he won't need a doctor though. - What do we do now? We can't relocate. With the commander like this, he can't travel too fast. - Sir, some of those people are Untouchables. - Follow them. - Yeah, they might lead us to their base. If we're lucky, we'll catch Domingo. - Get going. (gunshot fires) (cries out) (gunshots firing) (dramatic music) (man in car cries out) (gunshots firing) (men screaming) (grunts) - Leave me here. You gotta get back to headquarters quickly. Now go! - But Ron, I can't just leave you! - Just go now! Go protect the commander, go! Take care, all right! (gunshots firing) (serious music) (gunshot fires) (man screams) (gunshots firing) (grunting) - Sir, I'm afraid he got away. - Where is Gamino? - He's right behind me. (Gomino coughs) - Whoa, man! Why didn't you wait for me? You run too fast. - You'll lose a lot of weight. - Come on, boys, let's go. Come on. (vengeful music) - I'll be all right in a little while. We have to move from here. This isn't safe enough now. Go find a place. Outside of this village, where we can all go. (foreboding music) (Domingo grunts) - Commander, there's no way you can travel in your condition. I think it would be best if we wait for you to get better. To wheel a kite now is bad. - Karpov shouldn't know. He can't find out that we're on the run like this. (unfriendly music) Karpov would surely take this opportunity to wipe us out. I think right now we can use some help. See if you can locate the American. He should know our situation, because right now he's the only one we can trust. (malevolent music) Go now. Get O'Riley. - All right, Commander. I'll do it now. (sentimental music) (gunshots firing) (Domingo cries out) (dramatic music) - Hey! (gunshots firing) Go now! I want you to go! Don't worry about me! Try to split up and regroup later! Go now! - Commander, we can't leave you here! - If we go, we go together, Commander! (gunshots firing) (crazy music) (Domingo cries out) - Hannah! (frenzied music) Come on, move it! Come on! I'll cover you! - Right, go! Go on, hurry! (frantic music) (gunshots firing) (people screaming) (Hannah screams) - Commander Domingo, let's go! (wild music) (Domingo grunts) Let me help you! - No, go without me! - Come on! - Go! (men grunting) (fast music) (gunshots firing) - Cease fire! Cease fire! (perplexing music) (moves into questing music) - Hey! So you're the killer! Damn you! (gunshots firing) (man screams) (dramatic music) - Freeze, creep. (gunshots firing) (men shouting) (mysterious music) - Hold it! Hands up! Come on! (malevolent music) (gunshots firing) (women screaming) (splashing) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (helicopter roaring) (grunting) (gunshot fires) (eerie music) - A little further! (perplexed music) - Let's go! (questing music) - I'll deal. The deuces are wild. Today's gonna be my lucky day. (upbeat dance music) (laughs) (suspenseful music) (laughs) I win. (men laughing) What a sore loser! - Check out that. (card players laughing) - You guys can deal me out, for now. - [Card Player] He said deuces were wild! (laughs) (engine whirring) (uncertain music) - That's it! - Huh? (Samson screams) - Huh? - Huh? (gunshots firing) (men screaming) (splashing) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (thrilling music) (White Tiger grunts) - Come on! Move it, go, go, go! Get them, go! (galloping music) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (menacing music) (grunting) (thudding) (flesh squishing) (Samson cries out) (gunshots firing) (man screams) (exciting music) - Watch out! (gunshot fires) (White Tiger screams) (grunts) (thuds) No! (gunshots firing) (shooter screams) (dramatic music) (Brian screams) (gunshots firing) (man cries out) (splashes) (awestruck music) Tiger, I never thought I'd see you die. You saved my life many times, and I've saved yours more than once. I guess our luck just ran out, old buddy. (bittersweet music)
