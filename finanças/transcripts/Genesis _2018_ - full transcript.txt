No, seriously. Bonnet! You owe me five bucks. You'll get your measly fiver, you retard. You promised a week ago. The richer they are, the greedier too. Muscle, money, but no brains. Me, my name's Asselin. I can't think good 'cause I headed too many balls in soccer. Looking for trouble? L-low much is it worth'? Your pants! Tuck your shirt in! Geez, Gauvin! Tuck it in! Massicotte, upstairs. - Get a slip from Mrs. Moreau. - But, sir, I just... No! Shirts tucked in. Your third time this week. Another slip, Massicotte? Walk! Good night, girls! Fuck you, asshole. Who said that? Just like I thought. Scaredy-cat girls. It's beautiful. Yeah. Take pictures of me always. It's the best photo I've ever taken. Will you always look like that? Always, that's a long time. Don't you want to be together always? Yeah, maybe. But, actually, I don't know. We're young. What do you mean? All I'm saying is... We don't know What's going to happen. We have to be realistic. Who knows if we'll stay together? I didn't say I don't love you, just that... Then What do you mean? I'm just saying... if ever we want to hook up with someone and that helps us stay together... We shouldn't say we can't see other people. You Want an open relationship? - You mean it? - Yeah. It's no big deal. What I'm saying is no big deal, it's... Do you realize What you're saying? You Want to sleep around? Not really. All I'm saying is... if some day it happened, I wouldn't mind. Plus it means you can too. I sure hope so. If it means we stay together because We're attracted to someone... I'm not attracted to anyone else. But apparently you are. Well... Maybe, at some point. Maybe. Hypothetically speaking. But it's maybe. If that's What you Want, fine. I'm going, it stinks. Fine, I'll turn on the light. You'll see, guys. You're going to get older. You'll become interested not just in Women's breasts, but What's between their legs. Don't get me wrong. Breasts are worthy subjects. I'll come back to them. But What's between their legs... constitutes a world that's incredible, varied, colorful, infinitely subtle. It is the chalice from which one must learn to drink. Not just drink, but to delight in, to linger over, with intelligence and delicacy, sometimes with vigor, inspiration. Not like us guys, all the same. Shake it a bit and bang! No, each Woman is different. From one extreme to the other. Personally, I'm attracted to Women with long legs. You know, those long stems, their slender contours. Legs up to here. Big green eyes. Delicate features. Picture a Russian model... That's my thing. And it's with them I have the most success. But success... is something our pal Vandal will never know. Not with tall girls or short ones, not with Russian girls or Uzbeks or... Seriously? You should learn to speak Homo Sap/ens. Erectus had a somewhat limited vocabulary. You see, a Homo Sporticus like Vandal who reaps medal after medal. That works in high school, it's cool. But Wait for university. There, it's harder. Why's that? Because intelligence always triumphs in the end. And why'? Because over time intelligence sharpens, Whereas muscle, overtime, softens. Write that clown. Muscle turns to flab, as will our poor Vandal. He'll wind up... In the suburbs, sedentary, complacent, obese, all alone with his many trophies from high school. You know who will have success with women? The smart asses. With the gift of gab. Like Bonnet. That's right. Come on, do your imitation of me. Do us the honor, come on. Up front, imitation! Come on, dude. Go for it! Don't pretend you don't enjoy it. Get up here! Bonnet! Bonnet! Meanwhile, the 13 Colonies seethed, and the tiresome and, to be honest, boring history droned on of Upper and Lower Canada. With its deadening lack of spirit, blood, violence... Write that clown. Brunelle? What's wrong? You haven't asked your stupid question. Usually after five minutes, you Wave your hand to interrupt me, blather, spout utter nonsense. Which idiot said there are no stupid questions? There are stupid questions. And every day, Brunelle honors us with one. Right, Brunelle? Know What you are, Brunelle? Pathetic. Yes, pathetic. And blithely unaware that you are pathetic, condemned to live pathetically with your pathetic kind... pathetically conceived in your pathetic mother's pathetic womb. That'll do. Go sit clown. Enough for today. Let's begin. Lord Durham's Report. We're teammates, so we talk hockey. I admit we don't talk politics. Can't be very lofty... - No, but he's fun. He's nice. Empty, you mean. Mom? Mom? - I'll put her in bed. Right. Can you help me? - Take her legs. - Sure. - I'm so sorry. - No, it's fine. It's okay, I'll do it. Coming? - It's locked? - Yeah, my dad has the key. So we don't empty it tonight? No, so my mom doesn't get into it. Nicolas, I'm going. No, stay. No, I'm tired. Is that new? - What? - Your telescope. Yeah, my parents bought it for me. Just like that, for no reason? I asked dad for one and he said yes. It's amazing. You can see Saturn, the Moon. I'll just be a sec, okay? I hacked the school system. I could change my grades. I didn't. Whoever's in charge of security sucks. It's an open door. I could change all my grades. - You have to take off the lens cap. - I know. - What are you doing? - Taking your picture. - Great picture. - Sure, you're handsome. Aren't you a bit close? Not too many. It's real film, it's expensive. Want me to pose for you? Great, will that do? Okay, please stop. The lens is busted. Shit. And it's my dad's, too. I'm really sorry. - I can buy a new one. - It was an accident. You'd never be able to afford it. I told you I was sorry. It's the situation, not you. Saying you're sorry Won't fix the camera. What's so funny? Nothing. No, nothings funny. - Did you break his heart? - No. Are you still together? Yeah, but it's no fun anymore. Better you break his heart than vice versa. - L-low sweet. - What happened? - Why didn't you invite Maxims? - I'm not talking to you. I like Maxime. I'm not your mom, but if I may say, he's a very nice boy. Come on, Madelaine. She was talking to Guillaume, not you. We'll talk later. I can say What I think. Just because you think it doesn't mean it's appropriate. That's the problem. - And you? How's school? - Fine. Your teachers? Can't you answer anything besides mmm-hmm and fine? Can you give us a more coherent and elaborate reply? Can you do that? Mmm-hmm. Okay, fine. Australia! Australia! 100%! You've got the beach, it's... We new. The sun. Here we never get sun. There are sharks, you can't really swim. You're as likely to be bitten by a shark as crushed by a container machine. - A What machine? - The machines that sell food. - It's true! - A What? A vending machine. - It's true. - Come on! That's so random! They're curious. They don't have hands, so they bite to see What it is. Otherwise there'd be hundreds of attacks daily. On Reunion Isle you can't swim, people die every day. - Yeah. - Not true. It is! The coral reefs gone. Swimming's forbidden because of shark attacks. They're hungry so they hunt close to the shore. So why do they bite us? They don't eat humans, they don't like it. They're scared. If they bite off an arm, they spit it out again. They don't eat us. But now they're used to attacking. They're curious. "Hi, What are you?" - l-low cute! - It's not to eat you. If they Wanted to, they could swallow us whole. Not just bite off an arm. Seriously! They still bite off people's arms. - Hello. - Hi. - You okay? - Yeah, fine. - Hello again. - What's up? Things are fine. You? You seem chill. Yup! Come on! Keep a low center of gravity. Head up! You have to know Where your opponents are. That's it. Low center of gravity. The wing leaves his zone, break out! I Want the two other forwards to support the Wing. Make sure he has a clear passing lane... Lachance! Walk! Hey. Hi. - I'm Guillaume. - I know. Sorry, I don't know your name. Alexis. What are you up to? - I'm reading. - What? - Catcher in the Rye, Salinger. - I know it, I read it. You read it? - Did you like it? - Yeah. Holden Caulfield is like my idol. But I prefer Franny and Zooey Know it? Yeah, but I haven't read it yet. The Glass family is, like... sick. How old are you? Fourteen. Cool Smiths poster. Yeah, thanks. You like Morrissey? His lyrics are funny and smart. Who doesn't? Yeah, I like him too. I got that. Okay, girls! Lights out in five! - Well, I gotta go. - Okay. It was a pleasure. Me too, really. - Good night. - Good night. Late again. Yeah, sorry. I overslept. Don't you board here? - Yeah, my alarm... - it's 200 meters. You live there. What's it set at? - It's... - Well? At What? One minute to? Next time jerk off faster. You okay, Mr. Perrier? Careful What you agree to. I was on a radio show just now. On the subject of terrorism, I found myself... surrounded by lslamophobes. I was trapped. They figured, "With a name like Perrier, he's fizzy like champagne. Give him a shake, he'll pop his lid." In short... be careful What you agree to. What happened? "Wut happined?" Like I said, it was a trap. Did you straighten them out? Yeah. But you can only say so much. Understand? Do you know your Islamic history? What would you have said? Enlighten us. I don't know, but... if I'd realized they were morons, I might've walked out. Walk out? You can't do that. You have to stay cool. Or you're the one who looks dumb. You see? Then you've lost. Open your notebooks. You may look dumb, but you uphold your principles. Poor Bonnet. Defending your ideas, right? Surprise test! I said I could give one anytime. So, anytime is now. Take a sheet of paper. Notebook or paper? I just said a sheet of paper. Paper. Put away your notebooks. So, in a few Words, summarize the Durham Report. What's that, Bonnet? - I need paper. - No, you were talking in an exam. I need paper so I can write the exam. You didn't talk? You didn't use Words? Yes, but only to ask for some paper. Get out. - I asked for paper. - Get out! They Want to build a team to take gold when they host the Olympics. And force kids to play? They don't play hockey. Or watch it. They've got ice. Sure, but... And a huge population. Bingo! Excuse me. I Want to join the hockey A-team. Our lineup's full. I know I missed training, but I'd like a chance. I didn't know you play hockey. Nice catch. - You're Bonnet, right? - Yes. I learn fast. I'm a good skater, too. I see you got 55 in volleyball last year. Fifty-five, quite an accomplishment. Failing volleyball. I had problems with my serve. I hate volleyball. Hockey's my game. A completely different sport. So give me a chance. Can he even skate? Be at practice Tuesday. Tuesday? Thanks. - Fuck! - Who is it? Maxime. Maxime! Maxime's calling me too. He's going to call each of us! Maxime's alone! I'm not hiding. - Mute your phone. - Th?o may call. "Th?o may call!" That's so cute! Hello. Hello. You okay? Yeah. And you? Top shape. - Sleep Well? - Not much. Yeah, we didn't sleep much. You're so beautiful. Come have a look. Come look. Before clouds cover it. Have a look. High up on the left. A spot that's brighter orange than the rest. - No. - The upper left. It's Jupiter. No, I don't see it. - Look, on the left. - I said I don't see it. Do you need glasses? It's there. Let's go to bed, I'm tired. Stop. - What's up? - I don't Want to. - Why not? - I just don't Want to. Is something wrong? Do I have to justify myself? I said no. Plus I have my period. Doesn't bother me. - Well, it bothers me. Since when does it bother you? Fine, I get it. I Wasn't raping you. What are you doing? What's up? Are you going home? It's after 11:00. The trains don't run. What's up? Come here. What's wrong? I don't know. I don't know What's wrong. Is it What I said about an open relationship? Is that it? If it is, it was stupid. I didn't mean it. I just said it... It's over, Maxime. I don't love you anymore. I didn't mean What I said. I felt you were growing distant. - I can't lose you. - It's over. I don't Want see other girls. I just Want to be with you. I can't really talk now. Yeah. Yeah. Tomorrow, good. I'm sending a kiss. Is there someone else? Is there someone else, yes or no? No. Go on, forecheck! Come on. - Forecheck! Put me in? Harder! Coach? Back to the bench! No, stay here. I need a line change, come on! Okay, go. Hold on. - Hello! - Hi. - How's it going? - Good, you? Damn, you're beautiful. Ready? - Yeah. So... for tonight, my idea, I don't know if you feel like it... I Wanted to keep it simple, like, watch a movie at my place and order in. - If you want. - Totally. - Yeah? - Yeah. Perfect. But I have to make a little detour first, it Won't take long. It's nothing complicated, but... I have to see this girl because... Actually, I have to see my ex 'cause she owes me money and I need it. - She owes you money? - Yeah. Not you who owes her'? Maybe. So with you, it's Women who pay. Yeah. Can you support me? Nope, not a chance. Certainly not. I spend lots of money for the ladies, so... Sorry it took so long. She has a new boyfriend, a guy I know. She needed to talk, they have problems. It's super intense right now, so... I'll have to talk to him. All you did was talk? You're worried, huh? Don't worry about it. There's a reason she's my ex. Come on, give me a smile. Thanks. - All done? - Very kind. - A true pal. - Glad to help. Mikael lent me his class notes. Not like Massicotte. That princess, unwilling to help a friend. How so'? - I asked him yesterday and he send no. Seriously, he went, "No, I Won't lend my notes." A total lack of generosity. - He always asks me. - A total lack. It's all one-Way, he's never there for me. And here, I keep trying to reach out. I try to create ties, but you sabotage my efforts. It's sad! - By not lending my notes? - You'll die rich but lonely. Without me, you're gonna fail. Greed with your notes is a capital sin. - So's envy. - No, it isn't. What's going on? Nothing. Making fun of others again? Have you noticed how Bonnet thinks he's better? Superior. He loves to belittle, humiliate, tease, torment those different from him, those Weaker than him. Surprise! Less sharp-tongued. Not very admirable, Bonnet. Pretty cowardly, in fact. This haughty attitude, snobbery, arrogance. Your attitude disgusts me. He despises you all. So... this handout covers an interesting chapter in US history: which helped slaves flee north. Bonnet wouldn't have gotten involved because it required courage. Think it's true? What? What Perrier said in class. Like What? About me, that I think I'm better than others, arrogant. - Well? - Well What? Did you ask if I made the team? Anyway, I know the answer. Then why do you ask? Because I'm not 100% sure. It's in my nature to hope, even when it's hopeless. You didn't make it. Come on, you knew. You can barely stand on skates. It's that jerk who told you? Unbelievable! He could have told me himself. Asshole! Let's go! On your feet! That was an easy 5K. You were way too slow. Burpees. Right here. Make three rows. You okay? One last shot? - No. - Yes! Yes! I had enough. It's locked. Do you have any booze hidden? Yes. It's a treasure hunt. We'll find it. We know it's here. We'll find it. Over there, or maybe right here. We don't know. What the fuck? What are you doing? It's not cool! Relax. - Relax? Do you realize What you just did? Yeah. What the hell? Fuck! - Did you set this up? - No. - Or is it 'cause you're drunk? - I don't know. What is it, then? - Do you love me? - No. I was just curious. You were curious, but What makes you think I might be? Answer me! Nothing, but if you never try, you... You dreamed of kissing your best friend? Not really, but I wouldn't have tried with anyone else, with another guy. Is that What our friendship means to you? We're best friends. It doesn't change our friendship. If you think it lessens it, it doesn't. It would be really sad. But are you attracted to me? Tonight I was, yes. Why are you disappointed? I'm disappointed that... that We're best friends and this totally... What? It ruins everything! This isn't just friendship! Yes. It is just friendship. Like I said, it just happened, I never felt that Way before. Okay, that's enough. Enough. Let's stop. Let's stop talking. We'll talk about it another time. We'll see. Want me to go home? Yeah. I think it'd be better. Maybe it Won't change our friendship, but... But I need to digest What happened. Charlotte! Hey. We came to buy smokes. We're headed to the Fungus. Wanna come? You Want me to come? Well, yeah. What? We were only gone five minutes, to buy smokes. And before? What do you mean? I was Waiting for you at the Casa. Okay, but I don't get it. We said 11:00, didn't we? No, we saw 10100. It was a misunderstanding. It Wasn't on purpose, I'm sorry. I kept calling you on your cell. That's really funny, 'cause... We Went to this Weird, Fanny and I, we Went to do some... I don't know, it was like meditation, with chanting and stuff... Fanny, what was that meditation stuff we were doing? Anyway, we didn't notice the time go by. - Are you fucking with me? - No. Absolutely not. - Come on. Come with us. - No, I'm going home. Wait, no. You can't... Don't go like that. It's all good. No, it's not good. Not at all! Charlotte, come with us. Get up. You're being ridiculous. You seem to think it's funny. Get over it. It'll be fun. No, I don't feel like it. Seriously? Got a problem with that? No, I think you do. But... Come on, come with us! Come on! Charlotte? Isn't Th?o here? - Where is he? - His place. Hello? Who is it? It's me. Charlotte. It's late, Charlotte. I'm in bed. Can I come in? Look... when you took off before, I think you were right to. I changed my mind. Look, I really think you should go home. I think that... I don't know, I think I'm not good for you. You deserve better, really. You're young and / don't want to hurt you. I think we should stop seeing each other. Charlotte? Hello? Okay Have a good night. Guillaume? Guillaume? Are you asleep? No, I can't sleep. I can't either. I have something for you. A book? It's Franny and Zooey. Thanks. I'll give it back. No, keep it. It's a present. Good night. Good night. He was doing his PhD, but something happened. Nothing happened. He flunked his thesis. The economics teacher? Yeah. He's the Worst. He's always repeating himself, sputtering, supply and demand, supply and demand... Anyway. . . I really blew it. Good wine but no corkscrew, cheese but no knife. That's all right. I'm sure we can borrow from a picnicker. I'll go on a mission. I can go, I don't mind. This is really sweet. What is? All this, What you prepared. My pleasure. Be right back. Hi. Excuse me, but could I borrow a knife and corkscrew? Thank you. - Here. - Thanks. Charlotte! - Hi. - Hello. What's up? - I'm good, you? - Yeah. What are you up to? I'm having a picnic with a friend. Cool. Do you guys Want to chill with us? No, I'm going to go back. Okay. We'll be here if you feel like it. That was a long mission. Took a While to find. - Who lent it? - A couple, there.

So, will I see you soon? You'll miss your train. Guillaume? Hi. Hi. - You okay? - Yea h. Could I sleep with you? What? Could I sleep with you? Yeah. Yeah? What's going on? - Holy shit! - We're sleeping. Turn that off. What are you doing? We're sleeping. He'll go back to his bed. It's okay. Alexis, go back and sleep in your bed. It's all right. It's fine. Don't tell. Please don't tell. Don't tell my parents, okay? Seriously, don't tell them. - Alexis. Jesus Christ! Alexis, it's all right. Please, don't tell! Please! Please! Alexis. Alexis! - Don't tell! - It's all right. Don't worry. All right my ass, Bonnet! - You'll wake everybody up! - .Just wait, Bonnet! You're in deep shit! Very deep shit, believe me! Why? What did I do? Think I'm an idiot? Do you think I am? What are you doing? You shut up! - In deep shit! - Why? You raped a younger boy in my dormitory! You fucking pervert! Shut the fuck up! Christ! Guillaume? Are you okay? You came for a refill? You getting me drunk? I'm just offering, it's up to you. Anyway, I Won't empty this alone. - What? - I Won't empty it alone. I guess. So Where were we? Th?o's band. Do you like their music? Yeah, I like it a lot. - Do you play? - Yeah, I play guitar. I'm in two bands. Possibly three. It's going good. Last year I played with Leloup. Guy's fucked up. He's cool and smart. But... He's fucked up. My roommate brought me this from Poland. It's amazing. He's gone for a month. Nice change. Sharings cool, but a month by yourself... Strong stuff. Yeah, having the place to myself for a month feels good. But still, I don't know, I'm glad he... Want to kiss me? You okay? Are you all right? Want to get some air? - (C) Kay - C) Kay'? You okay?
