(reverent singing) That's the word that comes to mind when you look at Mecca. For over one thousand four hundred years, its story has captured the imagination of millions. From here, a messenger named Mohammed (peace be upon him), was born. From here, he commenced his prophet-hood, and the religion grew. A religion that came to dominate the entire Arab world. The prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Allah had made this city sacred, the day he created the heavens and the earth and it's sanctity shall remain, until the day of judgement." The preaching of Mohammed, and the founding of Islam turned Mecca from a local place of pilgrimage, to one of worldwide significance. Although it's true that only Muslims are allowed to enter the city, all practicing Muslims everywhere in the world are obliged to travel to Mecca at least once in their lifetime and perform the Islamic pilgrimage, known as the Hajj. Mecca is truly a city that never sleeps. A city that is in a continuous state of flux, expanding and contracting. Here construction work goes on all year round in preparation for the Hajj. From the air, you can see the way the city has literally been carved from the mountains, and developed over the years. At the centre of Mecca is the Haram the Haram, or sacred mosque, is considered to be the holiest place on earth by Muslims. Enclosed within the vast structure are not only the Kaaba, but the ZamZam Well, the Hijr, and the hills of Safa and Marwa. The Haram is ringed by seven towering minarets and sixty-four gates. The structure covers an area larger than 356,000 square meters and can accommodate over one million worshippers during the Hajj period. At the centre of the Haram is the black cubical structure, known as the Kaaba. Muslims throughout the world turn and face the direction of the Kaaba for their daily prayers symbolising unity in worshipping one God. Here in the Mataaf, the area immediately surrounding the Kaaba, the sense of awe is palpable. The yearning of the people to be close to the Kaaba and their sense of love and devotion to it, is so tangible it feels like an other worldly experience. Imagine, that from childhood, Muslims around the world are seeing images of this wondrous place in pictures, on prayer mats and hung on walls. Subliminally the image of this majestic black cube in a land far away creates a feeling of awe and admiration. And as they grow, they develop a sense of wonder and feel an inexplicable calling to this mystical place. So naturally, that moment when a worshipper sees the Kaaba for the first time in all it's magnificent glory, is one that they will never forget. Now for the first time in history, we have been granted access to the inner workings of the Haram as seen through the eyes of the people who work here. We followed these employees over the course of their regular duties, intersected by the five prayers that make up a full days cycle in the Haram. And who better than the General President of the Haramain, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman Sudais, to introduce this concept. It's dawn time in Mecca. The sun has not yet risen, but the streets as ever, are busy with the hustle and bustle of the pilgrims and locals making their way to the Haram. Mecca truly is a city that never sleeps. (prayer singing) It is the time for the Fajr prayer, Fajr, translates to "dawn" in the Arabic language. For Muslims, their is no better way to start the day. Here one of the Imams, or prayer leaders, Imam Bandar Baleela, takes his customary walk from the Imams' quarters on the outskirts of the Haram. All the way down to the front of the Kaaba, to lead the Fajr prayer. The Imams of Mecca are mostly appointed by royal decree by the custodian of the two holy mosques of Saudi Arabia. The criteria for selection is mainly their way of recitation and knowledge. The Imams of Mecca hold an esteem position with great responsibility. Their Quran recitation must not only be accurate, but also inviting. Satellite and online television now broadcast the prayers of Mecca live around the world and their voices become synonymous with the awe inspiring feeling of the holy city, and the diversity of the believers present. As spiritual leaders, people from all around the world seek their council Mecca is the holiest place in Islam, and to be the Imam of the Grand Mosque (Masjid Al-Haram) is the pinnacle of an Imam's career and an honour they have trained for their entire lives. The Fajr prayer is the shortest of all the prayers and consists of two Fard Rakahs. Fard means that it is an obligatory prayer. Rakahs refer to a single unit of the prayer with the prescribed movements and words. Of the five daily prayers, Fajr is considered the prayer most favoured by God. This could be because worshippers who attend this prayer do so whilst most of the world is sleeping. A powerful saying of the Muslims is, "prayer is better than sleep". Ayesha, the wife of the prophet reports that Mohammed (peace be upon him), said "The two (sunnah) Rakahs of Fajr are better than this world … and all it contains." This is Bandar Al Hitlabh. Bandar is part of the new social media division at the Haram under the supervision of the Riazah department. This department heads all media initiatives at the Haram, including responsibility for updating the social media networks. They are based in this office, just a stones throw away from the Haram. Like many of the workforce at the Haram, for Bandar the opportunity to work at the most important of all Islamic institutions were for too great to resist. Today, Bandar is organising a meeting with the rest of the Haram social media team. They will discus ways in which they can best utilise the Haram's popularity on social networks to spread the positive message of Islam. The social media team is relatively young, and they bring fresh ideas and impetus to an institution that is steeped in history and tradition. Many of the new recruits have studied abroad, primarily in the UK, USA and Canada. They are tech savvy, multilingual and skilled across a range of media disciplines. This is important within the context of Saudi Arabia, where many people rely on social media as their first port of call for updates and information on the Haram's activities. We joined the team now at the brainstorming meeting where Bandar is trying to organise the various departments of the Haram, in terms of importance for social media exposure. This is no easy task, considering that there are over 65 different departments, and every department within the Haram is important and has its own merits. After their brainstorming meeting, Haram social media manager Bandar, and photographer Mustafa arrive at the Kiswah Factory, located opposite the finance ministry in Mecca. This is the first time Bandar has visited the factory, and he is keen to find out more about the Kiswah cloth and how it is manufactured. He meets with Abdul Aziz, one of the mangers at the Kiswah Factory, to gain a better understanding. In 1927, Saudi king Abdul Aziz ordered the establishment of a factory dedicated to manufacturing the Kiswah, in Mecca. The Kiswah is the iconic black cloth that the structure of the Kaaba is covered with. It is adorned with specific verses from the Quran, which are engraved with threads of pure gold on it's black cover. Traditionally, the engraved verses combine praise to Allah, with the Islamic profession of faith (the Shahada): "There is no God but Allah, and Muhammed is the messenger of Allah". The Kiswah cloth of the Kaaba, has become one of the most distinguishing characteristics of the grand mosque. For this cloth is part of the sanctity and uniqueness of the holy site. Throughout the ages, it has been made from the most luxurious quality of material available, making it one of the most highly recognised and revered sacred textiles in the world. The factory employs around two hundred people, and uses the latest technology to create the Kiswah. Today the design of the Kiswah is computerised, allowing for faster results. There is also a frame for the entrance to the Kaaba. It is 23 feet high, and thirteen feet wide and it also contains Qur’anic verses, and other embroideries made from the gold and silver thread. Dyed black, and padded with white cotton fabric, it weighs more than 650 kilograms. The Qur’anic verses are skilfully embroidered in different calligraphic forms, by more than 200 talented artisans. While the materials used to be sourced from Egypt and surrounding countries, the finest silk threads are now imported from Germany, Switzerland and Italy. The Kiswah is easily the most expensive cloth in the world. The Kiswah is a great labour of love, taking an entire year to complete just one cloth. The amount of work, detail and design reflects the great importance of the Kiswah in the Islamic world. Whilst Bandar is speaking to some of the workers, Mustafa is busy taking photos which will be uploaded to the Haramain social media pages. Both are impressed with what they have seen. As well as producing the cloth, it is also the role of the Kiswah factory workers to maintain the shape and cleanliness of cloth once it is up on the Kaaba. With so many millions of devoted pilgrims touching and moving the Kiswah every year, it is of course subject to wear and tear. Therefore, it is customary every Hajj, to fold the Kaaba cover up to protect it. After the Hajj season is over, the cloth is dropped again to it's usual position. This only happens once in a year, and this is the first time that the process has been allowed to be filmed. We spoke to Mohammed Bajuwda, the Director General of the Kabaa Kiswah Factory, on the ground in the Mataaf, as this process was taking place. First, the supporting threads that are holding the Kiswah cloth up, are cut, all around the sides of the Kaaba. This allows the cloth to drop to the ground. The sides are then skilfully, and meticulously sown together by the factory's team of dedicated tailors. These tailors have been working at the Kiswah factory for many, many years and quite often the job of preparing and maintaining the Kiswah runs in the history of a family, with skills being passed on from father to son for many generations. These tailors are amongst the most experienced in Saudi Arabia, having undergone rigorous training courses to hone and sharpen their skills. Once the sides are secured, then the bottom portion of the Kiswah is folded, stitched and attached to rings at the base of the Kaaba, holding it firmly in place. One of the most difficult jobs in this process, is to cut the doorway of the Kiswah cloth. Once the space has been cut, the sides are then sown together neatly. The doorway of the Kaaba is, in itself, a wondrous site, it is made of pure gold, and is widely referred to as the door of repentance. Once the stitching on the sides is complete, the heavy embroidered cover is dropped over the doorway, and also sown firmly into place. Finally, with the rest of the Kiswah cloth secured, the team begins to fix the excess cloth around the black stone. First, it is cut to shape, and then thickened around the perimeter. Once this is done, the team apply the finishing touches, and sow this portion of the Kiswah into the circular shape required, to allow pilgrims access to the black stone. This is important because the black stone is one of the most revered of all the Islamic relics. It's colourful history predates even that of Islam, and according to Islamic tradition, it was originally set in it's place on the Kaaba by the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him. This dedication to the maintenance of the Kiswah again, reflects the importance of the Kiswah in the Islamic world. Indeed it is seen as a great honour to be among those who clean and maintain this cloth. It's a very special career field, and one that not just anybody can enter. Upon their return to the Haram, social media manager Bandar has arranged a meeting with a representative from the ZamZam water department. He approaches through the main gate in the Haram courtyard This is known as the King Fahd gate. Upon entering through the King Fahd gate, one is struck immediately by the elegance of the interior design of the Haram. Huge chandeliers adorn the high ceilings, and the archways and marble columns represent the major talents of Islamic architecture. The architectural design of the Haram is in itself, a framework to help facilitate the worship of the pilgrims. So with exception to the walkways, all areas of the Haram can be utilised for prayers and are facing the right direction to the Kaaba. One of the amazing things about the design of the Haram, is that whichever gate you walk through, all roads lead to the Kaaba. Bandar approaches the Kaaba now, to meet with one of the supervisors of ZamZam water department. Bandar wants to experience himself what it is like to actually distribute the water to the pilgrims. To this end, he's persuaded to try on the heavy water jacket. Distributing the ZamZam water to the pilgrims in the Mataaf is the job of a special group of ZamZam workers. Their sole aim is to provide refreshment for the pilgrims to ease their journey of Umrah or Hajj. But what exactly is ZamZam? And why is it so revered in Islam? The well of ZamZam, is a well, located within the Haram, just 20 meters east of the Kaaba. It's approximately 30 meters deep Up until around 1953, water was drawn by bucket, but electric pumps now pump water into tanks. In earlier times, the well was accessible for pilgrims who would go to view the well, but now it is underground and only a few select employees of the Haram have access to it. The water of ZamZam is distributed by water fountains, and dispensing containers built all around the Haram. All traditions agree that the origin of the well occurred when Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) created a spring of water to provide Hajira, the wife of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him), and her baby Prophet Ismail (peace be upon him) with water in the hot, dry valley they were in. The area around the spring, which was later converted to a well, became a resting place for the caravans, and eventually grew into the trading city of Mecca, and hence that start of the Meccan era in human history. For 4000 years, it has been quenching the thirst and providing nourishment for the pilgrims and this testifies to the sanctity and holiness of this land. Here in the courtyard, it appears as if suddenly the Haram got very busy. That's because it's the time for Jummah prayer. Jummah prayer occurs once a week on Friday, and it replaces the Dhur prayer on this day. In any given week, this is the busiest time for the workers at the Haram. Footfall can increase tenfold, and with it the level of safety and security concerns for the team managing this huge weekly event. Jummah is the most important prayer of the week, and this is visually reflected by the sheer numbers that are drawn to the Haram at this time. The worshippers flock into the Haram from all sides, the Mataaf is packed. To understand the significance within Islam the Jummah prayers, one must first seek to understand the significance of Friday. For Muslims, this is no ordinary day. The prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him), is quoted as saying on it God created Adam, on it he was made to enter paradise, on it he was expelled from paradise, and the day of judgement will take place, on no other day than Friday". This shows the significance of Friday, ultimately it comes down to the reward points system. Aws ibn Aws narrated that prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him), said “Whoever performs Ghusl on Friday and causes (his wife) to do ghusl, then goes early to the mosque and attends from the beginning of the Khutbah and draws near to the Imam and listens to him attentively, Allah will give him the full reward of fasting all the days of a year. And observing night vigil, on each of it's nights, for every step he took towards the mosque". So when the rewards for praying on Friday are magnified by such an extent, it's no wonder that Muslims prioritise this prayer. In Mecca, everybody wants to maximise the reward for their worship, but more on the rewards system later. The workers in the Mataaf are now busy preparing for the Jumah prayer. They have to clear the front of the Mataaf, which can be quite a challenge with thousands of devoted worshippers trying to touch the Kaaba. Once it is clear, they lay down the mats that the Imam, or prayer leader will stand upon to lead the actual prayer. Firstly the Minbar is brought out to be placed at the front of the Kaaba. It is similar in function to a lectern in a church, and usually it is characterised by 3 steps leading upwards. It is from here that the Imam will stand to deliver the sermon. The Haram has invested in one of the worlds best sound systems and it is tested meticulously. The Haram has round the clock technicians monitoring and mixing the sound. This ensures that wherever you are in the Haram, even in the courtyard, you'll have a perfect listening experience of the sermon. The Friday prayer is exactly like the 5 daily prayers, performed during the rest of the week, except that on Friday the imam, or prayer leader, delivers a two-part sermon known as the Khutbah, with a pause between the two parts of the sermon to allow for a time of personal prayer, or du’ah. In the sermon, or Khutbah as it is referred to in Arabic, the Imam usually reads and explains Qur’anic verses relevant to community at the time, and offering guidance and advice on how to live as a true Muslim in daily life. These reminders are an integral part of the Friday prayer. People come to the Haram from all corners of the earth, from many different cultures and countries. For this reason, the Haram has integrated a series of additional services for Jummah, to ensure that everyone, regardless of their situation, can benefit from the words of the Imam. Among these services, are provisions for death people. The Haram reserves and special area within the prayer hall, for those who are hard of hearing. Here, qualified signers translate the Khutba into sign language. The language barrier is also addressed, with many of the visitors to the Haram unable to understand the Arabic dialect. A team of translators work during the Khutba to translate it in real time, to many different languages. The Haram has also invested in radio technology and smart phone apps so the Friday Khutba is carried out across the airwaves worldwide. The messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), said "Prayer in congregation is superior to praying individually by 27 times". (sounds of prayer) Praying in congregation is all about unity, and Muslims see themselves as all part of one body, or one unmah, regardless of race, nationality, rich or poor, powerful or weak. During prayer, all stand next to each other in collective obedience to Allah. Once the Jummah prayer and the following Du"ah have finished, the Aman leaves the Mataaf and the circumvention of the Kaaba continues. But suddenly there is a huge number of people wanting to exit the Haram all at once, crowd control become the main issue. How to disperse of so many people quickly and safely. Most places of worship are not designed to handle such huge surges in capacity, and the crowd management department at the Haram has made huge strides in recent years on this front. Through carefully planned and adjustable walking routes, they have managed to improve the traffic flow, increase capacity and maintain clear sight lines, all without compromising the emotional experience of Jummah at the Haram. The result is that of a carefully regulated experience, with a huge team both monitoring CCTV for crown build-up, and on the ground ensuring the safety of the pilgrims. Over the years, the Haram has increased it's capacity in terms of both the numbers of worshippers, and also the services it provides to these worshippers. Naturally, the number of departments within the Haram has also had a corresponding increase. To see the Haram in the modern day, is to see an organisation with a fully functioning infrastructure that caters to the every need of its visitors. In all, there are over 66 departments within the Haram. Each department varies in size and function depending on the needs of the Haram and the worshippers. One of the areas in which there has been a massive increase in department size and employee numbers, is with technology, and the Haram is keen to utilise all the latest technology trends within it's infer structure. The I.T. department is one of the quickest growing departments, and has a staff of over 100 people. As well as maintaining the servers and monitoring all the systems within the Haram, this department also produces innovative mobile apps that add further value to the experience of the pilgrims. The I.T. department also helps connect all the Haram departments together, making communications between the departments easier and allowing for powerful online project management tools that help identifying isolate potential issues. Through these systems, project managers can communicate with different departments to solve any issue quickly and efficiently. Some of the departments, such as the library, have been around for a few years, but have been modernised from time to time to incorporate new systems, and technologies. The library of the Haram has different sections including a digital library, a selection of audio books, and also rare manuscripts. It is located on the second floor of the mosque, in an area of around 540 square meters. It contains some 30,000 books and 200 CDs The library is open to the pilgrims and visitors from 8am until 10pm every day. One of the busiest departments within the Haram is the maintenance department. Not surprising considering they are responsible for all the electrical components for the Haram. These include the lights, the air conditioning, sound systems, the escalators and the lifts The maintenance department is notified immediately if something is not working by the I.T. departments online checking system. So at any time of day or night, it is commonplace within the Haram to see members of the maintenance team repairing chandeliers, or getting an escalator moving again. Theirs is an important role within the Haram, as they need to always move quickly and work efficiently, because with so many visitors continuously moving through the Haram, the smallest detail can soon become a huge health and safety concern. Another innovative department that is gaining popularity within the Haram is the online Koran teaching facility. Here, qualified Tajweed teachers train people internationally on the correct pronunciation on the Quran. There are big plans to expand this department so the outreach of the Haram will extend to all four corners of the globe. The online Quran teaching department is another example of how the Haram is extending it's support for Muslims far beyond the confines of Mecca. The internet is enabling the Haram to exert influence and leadership for Muslims, all over the world. There is a driving force behind the efforts of all the workers in the Haram. Yes, they do everything for the love of God, but beyond that, they also do it for the worshippers. The worshippers come from every corner of the world. They come in their millions, and the workers in the Haram take a great pride and responsibility in their welfare, and hospitality is something of an art form, here in Mecca. But it's not easy for the workers, especially those on the ground, as the pilgrims speak a multitude of different languages. There is no common tongue around the Haram. This is the unique mesh of cultures and backgrounds, possibly anywhere in the world. Some have spent their entire life savings to come here, so you can understand their need to gain a maximum amount of spiritual blessings. And around the black stone, add to that a further, a quickening of the collective spirit. For some you see, it's a desperate last chance for salvation for a prayer to be answered, therefore it must be taken. The black stone must be touched. And the pilgrims can be most over zealous about achieving this. But for the most part, the pilgrims are tranquil, respectful of each other and moderate in their desire to touch the black stone. Merely, the best things come to the who are patient. Contrary to popular belief, and fuelled by the inaccurate reporting on the policies of the Haram, photography is not banned for the pilgrims. This is evident by the ever increasing phenomenon of social media in and around the Haram. The most famous example of this was in 2015, when social media giant Snapchat released Mecca live, a live streaming event that went viral on social media platforms. Worshippers want to remember the occasion. In Islam, Muslims say they pray each prayer as if it's your last. They may never be invited to Mecca again, so wouldn't you want a personal memento of the occasion? To really understand the mentality of the pilgrims in Mecca, you have to understand that for each pilgrim who comes, he carries with him the prayers of others. Here a worshipper is reading out a prayer, or du’ah, that he has prepared for a relative, requested specifically by name. This is a scene that is played out all over the Haram, especially in front of the Kaaba. A common phrase amongst the Muslims when meeting someone who is leaving for Mecca is, "Please remember me in your prayers", and making prayers for others who may not be fortunate enough to ever visit Mecca themselves, is paramount in most pilgrims minds. But the biggest smiles, and the warmest welcomes, are always reserved for the children. So amongst all these different nationalities, and this melting pot of cultures, what is it that these worshippers actually pray for when in front of the Kaaba? We decided to ask them. I did one prayer, just one prayer only, that I should be in heaven whenever I die, and that I die with the belief that there is only one God, and Mohammed is the messenger of God. For the workers in the Haram, these pilgrims are the cornerstone of everything they do, their ultimate reward is from God, but it's nice to know there is an earthy appreciation too. This is Waheed Mohammed Nah-has, he is the head of the Imam department of the Haram, we asked him to show us the office from where he operates. These 2 rooms are integral to the smooth running of the Haram, because this is the place where on of the most important functions of the Haram is carried out. This is where the call to prayer, known as the "Azaan" in Arabic, is made. When making the call to prayer, the Muezzin faces the Kaaba. We spoke to one of the Muezzin's to gain a deeper understanding of his work. The professional Muezzin is chosen for his good character, voice and skills, to serve at the mosque. He is someone who can recite the call to prayer beautifully and melodiously. Many western commentators have marvelled at the beauty of the Islamic call to prayer, sometimes without even knowing what it was they were hearing. Historically, the Muezzin would have recited the call to prayer atop the minarets in order to be heard by those around the mosque. Nowadays, the mosques often have loud speakers mounted on top of the minaret, and the Muezzin will use a microphone, allowing the call to prayer to be heard at great distances, without climbing the minaret. It's the time for Asr, the afternoon prayer. This is generally one of the most difficult prayers, as it takes place when the sun is directly on top of the Mataaf. This is the third of the 5 daily prayers. It's interesting to note that the prayer times for Muslims are not set, but changed slightly everyday to take into account the movement of the sun from any particular season. (call to prayer) (reverent music) At any time of day or night, it is common to see the cleansing of the Kaaba and the Haram. Throughout the ages, Islam has placed a major emphasis on cleanliness, both spiritual and physical. This is one of the common traits that Islam shares with the worlds other major religions. The difference is that in Islam, purification and cleanliness have been incorporated through direct commandment, into the core of the religion itself. It is obligatory for all worshippers to cleanse themselves thoroughly as part of the preparation for daily prayers. This process, known as "Wudu", is an important ritual part of the prayer. The water, used to wash the Mataaf area, is mixed with rose perfume. A mixture of disinfectants are used for the marble floor. And beautiful smelling ouds, and musk perfumes are used all over the structure of the Kaaba. Muslims take the cleaning of the Haram very seriously. Because to sanctify his house, is a direct commandment of God. Therefore, it is considered a mighty honour to be amongst those that work in the department of cleaning and furnishing and this department is granted unlimited resource to fully actualise this commandment. Having considered the importance of the cleaning department to the Haram, Bandar is on his way to speak to Abdul Majeed, who is one of the shift managers at the cleaning department. Abdul Majeed has been working at the Haram for 4 years, and his role is to supervise the team of cleaners around the Haram. Abdul Majeed gives Bandar more details on the duties they perform in front of the Kaaba, even though Bandar has been working at the Haram for over 2 years now, this is the first time he's witnessed the cleaning of the Mataaf up close and personal. The cleaning department is one of the largest in the Haram, in terms of man power. It is organised with 200 official and seasonal employees. In addition there are 2,700 workers, 260 controllers and over 100 supervisors. These employees are organised into 4 revolving shifts, enabling 24 hour coverage. Their duties include washing and cleansing of all areas of the Haram. The cleaners work with military precision, and their positioning and teamwork is a sight to behold. The cleaning of the Mataaf area of the Haram would be a straightforward task, the reason there is so much planning, precision and technique involved in this process is because in the Haram, there are always thousands of worshippers moving around the Kaaba. The cleaners have to be very, very organised, because logistically they cannot disturb the worshippers or impede the flow of the people before performing the Tawaaf. This is one of the great considerations of all the departments of the Haram, and it is evident in small details anywhere around the Haram. The extent of the planning, the precision of the execution and the unlimited resource used in the cleaning, is part in parcel of the sacredness of this holy city, and another means of honour in the Haram. So from the management view, the motivation of such a unique system of cleaning is evident, but if you really want to understand something, ask the people, doing the work, on the ground. What is it that so motivates these cleaners, often referred to as the heroes of the Haramain, to take such care and pride in their roles? You certainly don't find cleaners who work like this in other institutions. We spoke to one of the cleaners on the ground at the Haram, as he went about his daily duties, to try and find out Sajid Ahmed has been working as a cleaner in the Haram for over 15 years, and originally hails from Bangladesh. We asked him how his journey brought him here to the Haram This is Ali Jabber He has been working at the Haram for 4 years Ali works for the religious affairs department This department is relatively small, but the play an important educational role in the life at the Haram. They are usually scholars who have an in-depth understanding of Islam, and gentle personalities, they are instantly recognisable around the Haram by their distinctive brown robes, which helps give them an authoritative air amongst a sea of worshippers. In the Haram, you'll find people of all different cultures and countries, they come from all corners of the earth. With this they sometimes bring cultural baggage with them. By this we mean they have sometimes picked up customs and practices that are born out of their own cultural understanding of Islam, and are not backed up by the actual practices of Islam. This department's role is to guide the worshippers from all the different parts of the world, to a more educated and proven practice of Islam. This is a role that requires a great deal of understanding, patience and diplomacy, especially when worshippers are so fervent in their beliefs. After praying his 2 customary Rak'at, Ali Jabber joins the rest of the religious affairs team as they undertake some of their specific duties in the Mataaf. Ali Jabber tries to keep the crowd organised and moving along, so as not too become a hazard to the pilgrims performing the Tawaaf. It's a difficult job, and it's only from the air that one can truly appreciate the enormity of this task. We asked Ali Jabber to describe the best thing about working in the Haram. The sun sets over Mecca, this denotes the time for the Maghrib prayer. Maghrib has 3 compulsory Rak'at, or 3 units of prayer. The first 2 units are prayed aloud by the Imam in congregation. And the third unit, is prayed in silence. The time for these 5 prayers is the only time you'll hear relative silence in the Haram. The hustle and bustle of the place stops, all movement stops the walkways and spaces become empty and deserted. Remember earlier we spoke about the reward system? And how every person here in Mecca wants to maximise the value of their worship. Well, one of the astounding facts about Mecca, is that every prayer here in this holy place, is equated to the value of 100,000 prayers elsewhere. This is the level to which the Haram is elevated in the eyes of Islam. Over the years, the Haram has been expanded several times to facilitate the ever increasing number of pilgrims. The current expansion, is the single biggest expansion project in history. The expansion will complete it's first phase in 2020, and the construction work on the Haram is non stop around the clock. The late king Abdullah had laid the foundation stone for the expansion of the grand mosque at a ceremony held at Mecca on August 19th 2011. The holy mosques expansion include the Massa expansion, which has already been opened, and the expansion of the Mataaf. Added to it will be external parks, flyovers, a new complex of central services buildings, service tunnels, security buildings, a hospital, pedestrian-used tunnels, transportation stations, bridges leading to the mosque, and the first ring road that will totally surround the area of the Haram. A complete infrastructure, which includes power stations, water reservoirs and flood draining systems, will be built to support and maintain and power the expansion. The Haram has a team of international experts looking after every aspect of the expansion. They work through day and night and manage to plethora of smaller construction projects based off of the bigger landscape changing designs. Amongst the construction, great consideration has been given to the comfort of the worshippers, so huge new prayer halls have been constructed. The elegance of the design is consistent with the rest of the Haram's internal architecture, and is quintessentially Arabian in look and feel. Impressive looking chandeliers adorn the area, and huge domes will eventually add to the finishing touches. The Mataaf, before the expansion, received around 50,000 per hour, and 188,000 worshippers. After the expansion, the Mataaf will be able to receive 107,000 people per hour and 278,000 worshippers. That's an increase of over 50%. The expansion is an immense project, a grand vision that is slowly becoming a reality. It is a massive and complex international effort, but it demonstrates the immense measures that are taking place within the Haram to increase the safety, and comfort of the millions of pilgrims. The majority of visitors who come to the Haram, both locally and internationally, are coming for the pilgrimage. This consists of the Hajj, which can only be carried out between specific dates of the year, and the Umrah, which can be carried out all year round. The Hajj is the single largest gathering and movement of people in the world, and the Haram is in a continuous state of preparation for the Hajj, all year round. The Hajj is compulsory as part of the religion of Islam, and every able bodied Muslim, male and female, is obliged to carry out the Hajj at least once in their lifetime. It is known as the major pilgrimage and it is one of the 5 pillars of Islam. The Umrah is known as the "minor" pilgrimage. We joined one of the thousands of pilgrims who were performing the Umrah, to gain a clear understanding and a step by step visual account of the rituals involved. This is Abdul Hakim, Abdul has travelled to Mecca from Nigeria, with the intention to perform his Umrah. This is the first time he has ever visited the Kaaba. The first thing that is noticeable about Abdul, is what he is wearing. Two simple white unstitched cloths, this is known as the "Ihram", meaning a sacred state. A pilgrim must enter into this state before crossing the pilgrimage boundary, known as the "Miqaat". By performing the cleansing rituals and wearing the prescribed attire. Once a Muslim has entered into the state of Ihram, he agrees to abide by certain conditions. You see the state of Ihram goes far beyond ones clothing, and it is considered most important to enter a spiritual state of mind. There is also no gender segregation during the pilgrimage. This is to remind everyone that on the day of judgement, both men and women will be standing together, side by side, in the same rows. Now Abdul is performing Tawaaf, this is the first part of the Umrah. Tawaaf consists of circumventing the Kaaba, anti clockwise, 7 times. Men are encouraged to do this 3 times at a hurried pace, followed by 4 times at a more leisurely pace. During the Tawaaf, pilgrims can recite passages from the holy Quran, and also pray for the things that they want, and ask Allah to forgive their sins. On each of the 7 passes, the aim for Muslims is to kiss, or at least touch, the black stone, but this is often not possible because of the large crowds, so it is acceptable for them to simply point, or hold up their hand to the stone on each circuit. They're also to make the prayer 'Bismillah Allahu Akbar' each time they approach, as Abdul is doing now. Having completed his 7 cycles to make up the Tawaaf part of the Umrah, Abdul now proceeds to the next ritual, the Say'ee. Before he makes his way to Safa Marwa for the Say'ee, he stops to perform 2 Nafl prayers, and to take a drink of ZamZam. As he arrives at Safa Marwa, we're reminded again of the purpose of this ritual. Remember the story of the ZamZam well? This part of the Umrah is a literal re-enactment of the scene, where Hajar is frantically searching for water, for baby Ishmael and Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala), provided a spring of water for them. This is the same source of water, that is today called, the well of ZamZam. To perform this part of the Umrah, Abdul walks seven times back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwa. He increases the pace of walk to a brisk run, when the green lights in the Haram indicate. This is representative of Hajer running for a portion between the 2 mountains, where she could not see her son. One of the astounding things about Safa Marwa, is that those 2 hills, which Hajer ran between all those centuries ago, are still perfectly preserved here within the Haram. This means that these pilgrims today, are literally walking in the footsteps of the blessed. The final part of Umrah is to cut, or shave the hair. A partial shortening of the hair is acceptable and typically reserved for women, who cut a minimum of 1 inch or more of their hair. Usually men will perform a complete shaving of the hair, both of these signify the submission to the will of God, over glorifying physical appearances. The head shaving/cutting signifies the end of the Umrah. It's the time for Isha, the night prayer. This is the fifth and final prayer before the cycle starts again with Fajr. In Mecca, everything is set by the times of these 5 prayers. If you are going to meet a friend for coffee at night, instead of specifying a time, you would simply say, "meet after Isha". Or, if you had to make a daytime appointment, you would say, "book it for after Asr". These are common phrases used by Muslims, not only in Mecca, but all over the world. It's swift approaching the end of the day, as Bandar and Mustafa return to the Riazah offices. They are exited to share with the rest of the team what they have found in the Haram. The Haram in Mecca remains one of the most important and respected institutions of our times. It significance only increased by new modern day technologies, and the ability for pilgrims to arrive with ease, from all over the world. In these increasingly dark times for humanity, the Haram shines as a beacon of moderation and leadership for the Islamic world, and Muslims everywhere. But this ancient land is rich with the sacred history of Islam, making it conducive to humidity, and worship. For millions of Muslims, that first vision of the Kaaba and the holy mosque is an unforgettable moment, a moment that transcend all things into the life of this world. For truly the Kaaba is a magnificent structure, it stands serene and majestic as thousands circumvent it. Sure, there are many challenges ahead, balancing modernisation with tradition, increasing the safety of the pilgrims, crowd control, completing the ambitious expansion plans, but with the sense of awe and awareness that the Haram inspires in the individuals who work here, there is a strong belief that all challenges will be overcome. That this place, and this city, most beloved by God, will rise above any obstacles. This is after all, the centre of the world of worship. The most important physical space on earth for Muslims, and the oldest pace of prayer, to the God of mankind.
