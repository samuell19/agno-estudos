How's it going, sir? - How you doing today? - Doing all right. Doing all right? Have you met Jesus Christ? No, not personally. - Sir, do you believe in Jesus Christ? - Yes, I believe in Jesus Christ. I got ten for ten, mix and match. You want an egg? No. What time you get up? Just a second ago. Well, you better start practicing waking up like normal people. Salmon. Tuna. Beef. Hello? Uh, this is him speaking. Officer Banks? Yeah, I appreciate your returning my call. Um, I was actually hoping you would be able to grant me exemption to travel out of state. It's my niece's birthday next month, and my sister is having a birthday party. On the... 30th of July. Um, in Arlington, Virginia. Yes, ma'am. Um, 3550... Nelly Curtis Drive. Um, it starts at 3:00. Um, probably 6:00 or 7:00. Yes, ma'am. I know. I'm getting my days mixed up. Yes, ma'am. I understand. You too. I got you your salmon. - It's okay. - Hey, Dad, did you get milk? - What? - Did you get milk? Use the creamer. I can't fucking drink creamer. Hey, what's up? Going crazy. You gonna come? Yeah, another week and I get this shit off. You know, the same. He can't say five words without a nag. Yeah, I called her, but, I mean, you know. She said it's not enough time to process and a whole bunch of other bullshit. Nothing. I just lost track of the dates. I'm gonna miss you too. I'm gonna make Kara a card, all right? Next week? All righty. Well, I'll be here. Nothing. I just wanted to let you know that I tried to make it to the party, but it is what it is. He's in the garden playing with his cats. Yeah, yeah. I love you more. Hey, Dad. It's Kate. Hey. Yeah. Well, I told him not to bother. He shouldn't push it, especially now. I don't know. You're gonna have to ask him yourself. Beats me. Volunteers of America or the Job Corps. Ah, I think he's too old. I mean he's supposed to be studying for his HVAC exam now, but... No, I don't know. Huh? He's too impatient. You know that. Hey, yo. Oh, shit. Hey. Hey. We have a medium to medium-high heatgrill. - Who was that? - Courtney. She says "fuck you." That's the great thing about a tenderloin. Hey. Courtney, huh? Yeah.

Some things of mine. She say anything? Yeah. She said hi. Hi to you. Hi to me. Happy this bullshit's coming off. And she gave me a letter. You read it? No. Why didn't you read it? Why would I? You know the problem with you, Keith? Yeah, and what's that, Dad? You don't wanna hear anything that makes you feel guilty. Yeah, I don't think that's my problem. I don't have a problem with guilt. I have a problem with knowing that I let everybody down. Well, then don't! Ha ha ha! - Who let the dog out? - It's good to see you. - Yeah, man. Son, you remember A-Rock? - Yeah. Where's your sister? - Yo, this is Busy. - What's up, man? Yeah, we heard you got your box off a couple of weeks ago. We know it's gonna be difficult.

What you been cooking the last six months? Nothing, man. Just trying to get back on my feet. Baby steps. You ain't no baby. I've been born again. What? Shit. I was about to say, man. You trying to work? Not really. Come on, dawg. This ain't no buffet. You don't just dip in and dip out. Remember your family, dawg. We was there for you on the inside. We here for you on the outside. Yeah, I know. And I appreciate that, Gary. But I need to be there for my real family right now, the one inside this house. - All right. - It is good to see you though. - Mm-hmm. - Peace out. You too, man. Hey. Tell your sister I said what's up. Man, shut the fuck up! Get in the van and ride bitch, man! All right, we're gonna talk about heat transfer. This is a topical outline of what we're going to do. We're gonna talk about how heat, which is energy, moves. We're gonna talk about heat transfer coefficients‒ U values. HTM's‒ heat transfer multipliers. And we're gonna define sensible and latent heat. We're gonna tell you what to measure. Walls. Gross, then net. We'll talk about that. Partitions. Knee walls. Floors. Slab, elevated, below-grade floors. Ceilings and roof combinations. Windows. Glazing, fenestration, whatever you wanna call it, and direction become important. Doors, people, and appliances. All those things we're gonna talk about. All right? So if somebody will hit the magic start button, we will get going. Thank you. Hey, hey. What's good, Mr. John? Kale. Lettuce. Leafy greens. Waitin' on the beans. I see your dad out watering twice a day. Yeah, he is. Tell him to grow something he could eat. He doesn't really mess with vegetables. You know he's not a real practical man. Hey. I actually came over to ask you a favor. I was hoping maybe I could borrow your truck to run a few errands. Tank's empty. Maybe I could borrow 20 bucks to fill it up for you. I plan on getting paid. I just need a little help getting back on my feet. You ask your dad? I'd like to avoid that situation. Sorry to ask. You gonna return the favor? Yeah, anything you want, Mr. John. - Let me borrow your riding mower? - Yeah, absolutely. - Go see Candace about the keys. - All righty. She probably layin' around the house somewhere. All right, cool. Thank you. And hey. Welcome back. Thank you, Mr. John. Hey, yo, Candace! Candace! - What's up? - What you want? I need to borrow the truck. Okay. And what's that got to do with me? Your dad said you had the keys. - Hey, you miss me? - Hell, no! I can't fuck with you no more. - Yeah, and why's that? - You owe me an apology. Yeah, for what? You've been out for a year and I haven't seen you. Candace, I've been on house arrest for a year. What do you want me to say? You could've called me. You're not my girl, Candace. I know that, motherfucker. - You need to stop playing, Candace. - Hmph. Here. - Catch you later. - Deuces. Hey, boy, I was wondering when you were gonna show. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. What's new? Nothing much. I was talking to your sister. Are you back in the swing of things? I'm trying. - How's your dad? - Same as ever. - You haven't killed him yet? - You know he's the man of steel. Hey, you want a beer? I'm good right now. Is, uh, Ladybug in? She's cooking supper. Supper? What time is it? Hey, you know she cooks all day long. You know that. Hey, what's up, Mama? Who's that? Oh, my God. Oh, Keith. Oh, my baby. I missed you. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ah, ah! - How are you? - I'm good. It's good to see you. - You hungry? - Yeah, sure. I'll eat. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah? - Go sit down. - You need some help? No, no. You sit. I got your letters. I read your letters, Mama. But you didn't write back. Would you like a crab cake? Yeah. How's your father? Good. Same as ever. And Kate? She's actually coming by this afternoon. Thank you. So, I heard Uncle Rick's working that Fort Howard site. Yeah, he's making a lot of money now. Yeah, I bet. You guys got any extra work for me around here? I don't want you anywhere near the liquor, Keith. Come on, Mama. You already have enough temptation. I've been thinking a lot about your mother. Her birthday was last week. Did you remember it was her birthday? - Yeah. - Did you‒ Did you visit her? I haven't got the chance yet. It's always hard for me around your mother's birthday. You two did all kinds of things together. You'd take long walks around the neighborhood. You had this little ice cream truck and you'd stop all the time and pick up little things and put them in that truck. Little treasures. She was very devoted to you. She believed in you. But at 26 years old, you can go one way or the other. You can pull yourself out of it, which I think you're on the way to doing, and try to figure out some plan for your life. Or you can go right back into it. You got to go back to school. That's the only chance you have. You're not too old. You can start again. You can go to CCBC. You already have a year. I'll help pay for your books. I've got your grandfather's pension. Plus, I've got my social security. Plus, I have a little money left from your mother's insurance. Who knows how long I'm gonna last? I'm not taking your money. I don't want you to waste what you've got. I know how smart you are. Mama, I don't know if I'm ready to go back to school. I just need to find a job. Well, where are you gonna work? What are you gonna do? I don't know yet, but I'm gonna figure something out. You're the most important thing in my life, Keith. Don't say that. Finish your‒ Finish your supper. Eat. - What's up, Uncle Rick? - What's up, Keith? - How you doing? - Good. Good to see you. Good to see you. - Yeah, Ladybug called. - I was hoping. I got a haul for you. It's only about 50 or 60. - It works. - All right, cool. Pull the truck over to the dock and we'll load up. - Right around here? - Yep. - All right, cool. - All right. Thank you. Hey, Rob, you got a pair of gloves for him? Come on back. Keep going. All right, you're good. - You probably want these. - Thank you. Ah, this looks good. Hell, yeah. - What's up, man? - Not much. What's going on, man? - All steel? - Yeah, it should be. - Okay, you're good. - Yeah, thank you. No problem. - Hey, what's up? - Hi. - I just dropped a load off. - All right. You've got, um, 45.80. - Damn, that's it? - Yep. - Thank you. - Have a good one. You too. - Watch your back, nigga! - You fuckin' kidding me? You're getting real fuckin' brave! What the fuck, motherfucker? You're lucky I don't have my gun! I guess it's time for you to start learning how to use those fuckin' hands! - I will fuck you up! - Yeah, bet. Pussy-ass bitch. What's up? I'm late. Can you please take these kids away from me? What's up, Jack? How you doing? - Uncle Keith! - It's good to see you. - Hey. - Hey, Grandpa! Come here. - Can we play out back? - Can we play out back? No luck? What's that lawyer good for? He's not my lawyer. He's the state's. He's not answering my calls, and probations isn't budging. It's like they only care when I'm fucking up. So, why aren't you having this party in Maryland? She wants her friends there, Keith. - Why did you even move to Virginia? - Keith. - I got some stuff. - You didn't have to do that. It's inside the truck. I made a card too. Ah! Jesus, Keith. You should not be spending all your money on Cheetos. Yeah, I didn't have an envelope. Oh! - She's gonna love that. - Yeah? Here, let me help you with this. - All right, I'll pop the trunk. - All right. - Is that all of it? - Yeah. I was gonna tell you this Sunday, but we are getting a new car. Yeah, it's about time. Oh, I didn't realize you were so fancy. I guess I won't give it to you then. - Seriously? - Yeah, I'll find somebody who wants it. Stop playing. You know I want it. - When can I get it? - As soon as the loan comes through. - Nice. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. You and dad doing okay? When we're in separate rooms. He's a lot easier than he used to be. Believe me. Just try to be patient. I need to get out of here. Where are you gonna go? I don't know yet, but I can't do it. Just relax. Please. You're so impatient. You're just like Mom. You ever think that's why he hates me? He doesn't hate you. Do you think he would be doing all of this if he hated you? - I gotta go. - All right. Mmm. - All right. Thanks for all of this. - I know. - I wish I could be there. - I know. I wish you could too. She would rather have her uncle with her than all the snacks in the world. Next year. Promise? I swear. Keith! You good? All right. All right, you ready? Pull it all the way to the right. Thanks for getting the spot, Jess. No problem. I know it's been a while. When I get my money up, I'm gonna come see you at the club though. I'm at the Gold Club on Thursdays. You should come by there. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. It's nicer than the Russian. Getting fancy? - I'll save up, all right? - Yeah, you better. - You ready? - Yeah. All right, let's do this. Hey. I'll see ya. I'll see ya. Hey, go make that dirty money. I'm going to school, you asshole. Okay, don't forget. 2:50. Okay? For lunch. Yes. I'll talk to you in a few‒ Could you hold‒ Oh, just‒ Could you hold just a moment, please? Thank you. Yes. May I help you? Um, I'm looking for the HVAC workshop that I signed up for. Yes. You're a little late, but they may let you in. Um, you can go in that room over there and see Mr. Monte. - Mr. Monte? - Mr. Monte. Yes. - Thank you very much. - You have a blessed day. Yes. Excuse me, sir. I signed up for the HVAC class. - What's your name? - Uh, Keith Cohill. - Forget it. - Forget what? I have a note here that you didn't show last week, and you're 45 minutes late for week two. It would cause a disruption if you join the group now. Sir, I'm on probation. I can get a note from my PO. Nope. I'm sorry. It's policy. You'll have to enroll in the class the next time it's offered. Well, when's that? I won't know until September. You serious? What'd I say? All right, man, thank you. Yo, Marquis here? - Who's askin'? - It's Keith. Now's not a good time. Yo, did I stutter? Yo, just tell him to come to the door. It's Keith. Marquis, it's Keith! - I got it, man. - All right. - What's up, man? - Damn, yo, what's up? - Chillin'. How you doin'? - Damn. The fuck is you geekin' for, man? Look, like he told you, we're a little busy right now. Tryin' to get a hold of you. I know. Check this out though. Hey, yo, turn that shit back up. Yeah, boy. Hell, yeah, we gonna get on the radio with this shit. - It's you? - Hell, yeah. Man, this ain't no hobby no more. We gettin' on with this. - Sounds good. Sounds good. - Hell, yeah. What about you? Just tryin' to get back on my feet, make some money. Mm. Let me guess. You need some help with that? I got a car now. And I know Northeast. Okay. And I know bars you can't walk into.

No. Riha's downstairs. - Downstairs? - Downstairs. - What do you need? - Are you Riha? Yeah. I left my mower a while back, and I was wondering if you still had it. - What color? - It's orange. - You push it? - Yeah. How long ago did you bring it in? Uh, over a year ago. It's electric. - Ah. I got one here that's been sittin'. - Yeah? - Come on. I'll show you. - Thank you. Seven-inch wheels and side discharge, no mulch? Yeah, that sounds about right. That the one? Ah, yeah, that's her. I got it. I got it. Don't worry about it. I replaced the battery cord and cleaned the air vent. It might still need a blade, but it's cheaper to do it yourself. Just be careful. Yes, ma'am. What's the‒ What's the total? I'll never find that receipt. Just give me 40 bucks. - Forty? - Yeah. Thank you. There you go. Appreciate that. I got your mower. - What are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood. You should have called me before you came here. I thought you might need it. I could have got that myself.

Yeah, well, I talk how I please. You know, you're real fuckin' stupid. Why you always trying to find trouble? - I'm not. - Yeah, well, why are you here then? I'm just here to talk to Jessie.

You bitch! Get the fuck off me! - Get the fuck off‒ - Keith! - Get the fuck off‒ - Keith! Keith! - Get the fuck off me! - You don't mean it. Yo, ain't nobody playin' with your dumb ass! Bitch-made-ass motherfucker! - Stop! - Are you okay? Fuck. Why did you come here, Keith? I came to see you. - Come with me. - Are you drunk? - Come on. I'm lonely. - I'm working, Keith. - Yeah, he's working too. - Shut the fuck up, Kelsey! - Why the fuck you even out here? - Come on. Go clean yourself up. I just wanted to see you. You should go to the hospital. I'll hit you later, all right? Stupid-ass motherfucker. Come on. I saw that. What'd you see? I'm staying up at Patapsco and Willow Spring Road, on the corner. I got some heat if you're thirsty. Right on the corner. Just ask for Wasp. - Me and you, motherfucker! - You're a fuckin' punk! You hit me from behind in a crowded bar. If they ain't pull me off, I'd have broken your fuckin' nose. Now's your chance. Go back to your mom's day care, you fuckin' runt. Don't talk about my fuckin' mother. Yeah, I'm gonna fuck your mom. Fuck! What the fuck! Hey, yo. What'd I tell you? I told you to stop dealing with them corny motherfuckers. - Is you all right? - Yeah, I'm good. Shit. Good thing recycling didn't come around today for real, 'cause they would've got they head hit. Hell, yeah. Shit. Look, man, I don't know what you was fuckin' with when you was locked up, but around here, we don't fuck with them boys. Yeah. - Stop talking to 'em. - I know. How long you lived in this neighborhood? - Fifteen years. - All right then. You should know better. Your father used to work at Bethlehem Steel with my father. This our neighborhood. This ain't up top. - You got a broom, yo? - What? Fuck. Clean this shit up. Stupid ass, man. That's my nigga, but he dumb as shit. I'm tryin' to spare his ass, man. That shit was funny, though, right? Hey. Big man, what's up, baby? - What's up, dawg? - Yo, I need to see Mom. All right. Hey, yo, he's here to see Mom. - Yo, what's up, man? - Who the fuck are you, man? Keith. I need to see Mom. I don't know you from Adam, man. As far as I'm concerned, you might be Five-0. State the oath. On my honor, uh, I swear to keep myself physically strong, mentally agile, and spiritually awakened. I'm honorable and loyal. I'm respectful, helpful, shrewd, and straight. I have self-discipline, self-respect, and endurance. I have dignity, morality, and integrity. You a little rusty, homeslice, but come on. Have a seat, bitch. Have we met? Yes, sir, uh, briefly in Jessup. Oh, Jessup dawg. - Who did you associate with? - I was assistant to FA. - Moneyman. - Yeah. - Smoke? - No, I'm good. It's rose petal and some marshmallow. Natural. How long you been out? Just got done nine months home detention. You need work? Yeah, but I got mixed up with the wrong people, and I want out. Who? Little G was my FG, but I know him as Gary from way back when in Dundalk. - Does he respect your decision? - I don't know. He came to my house uninvited with a couple of soldiers. - And? - I was hoping maybe you could tell him to stop flexing and let me get back on my feet. Are you a white man? As far as I know. That's good. Then remember... these inactions are a mirror. They reflect the character of the individual defined by dignity, morality, and integrity. Okay, that's the eye. The eye is a radical fucking thing. Separate the honorable from the dishonorable, conflict goes away. True virtue is based on what is morally right. The truth conforms to reality, but it can only be found, right, in the conscience. In the consciousness. Now, if you choose a falsehood based on preference rather than true truth, you give yourself to a lie. And when you give yourself to a lie, you commit yourself to destruction. And your life... simply comes to destruction. Yes, sir. Power in teachings of the eye changes men, right, into great men, and it alters completely. The whole moral a-a-and mental outlook - Mm-hmm. - of those who walk within the eye. Those who enter the eye. - Do you understand what I'm saying here? - Yeah, I do. Listen to me, okay? This is a science. I walk like this and talk like this to reach you in your fucking mind. When you see me, you say, "What the fuck?" Because I walk with "what the fuck." I want you to walk with "what the fuck." - Hmm? - Yes, sir. Remember it. The wise and honorable always keep their kingdom and their land... and their house clean of foolishness and dishonor. So you can help me with this? A true man walks a lonely path. ♪ Yeah, inside you got the club ♪ ♪ Chicks and drugs ♪ ♪ Inside, outside ♪ ♪ Outside you got the money Whips and thugs ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Kara ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Whoo! - Yeah! - Yeah!

Getting in? I missed my bus. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Oh, it's hot. - How much you need? No, baby, I'm headed down to the clinic. - Down on Sinclair. - Oh, you on a program? Three weeks. Congratulations. Thank you. - Can I bum a cigarette? - Yeah. Shit. You probably need it. You got it. Mmm. Yeah. I had to get off the dope. My son is living with me now. Too much going in and out of the house, you know? - That's good. - Trying to set a good example. I want my boyfriend and my son to come with me to the clinic, but they don't got no patience. They can wait all day to cop, but they can't wait 30 minutes for the bus. How much you payin'? 160, but I'm on reduced disability. No, for the methadone. Oh. Uh, ten dollars, two bottles. - Yeah.

You were staring at my drawing. - Do you go here? - No. - Thinking about it though. - For art? No. I need to make a living. What were you doing in the art building then? I was lost. - Where's your car? - Right down there. Drive me home? Take your shoes off. They're dirty. It's like a museum in here. - Oh, yeah. My parents are fans. - What do they do? - Do you want some salami? - Yeah. Thank you. My dad works for Aberdeen. My mom doesn't. - Where they at? - Miami. Yours? My dad's retired, and, uh, my mom died a few years back. Oh. I'm sorry. It's all good. I've been watering these down too much already. They're beginning to notice. Do you wanna get high? - How old are you again? - How old are you? Take a guess. Mm. I don't wanna know that bad. A'ight. Now the second left. There's some parking at the front. You can park in one of the handicapped spots. - Who's handicapped? - Me. - Are you fucking kidding me? - What? You're a real classy guy. Come on. It's nice on the inside. Come on. What? Oh, yeah? Like that? She good. You can't come in here. Why is that? - 'Cause Tommy said no. - Why? Because he can't have no trouble in here, man. Because that fucking clown jumped me? He broke a fucking bottle over my head. I could've called the cops. Really? You like the police? - Fuck you. Let me in. - Yo, move on. - Hey. - Don't fucking touch me, man. - Yo, too late. - Let's go someplace else. Forget it. Hey, wait up. - Where are we going? - I need to go talk to somebody real quick. - Why? - Don't worry about it. - Should I just go home? - No. All right. I'm just gonna say hi real quick. Is Wasp here? Mike's upstairs. - Who? - Wasp. - How do I get there? - Around the corner, straight up. - Cool. - Uh-uh. She stays here. I'll be right back, all right? Well, make yourself comfortable. Come on. Have a seat. Hey, look who came for a visit. - What's up, man? - Come on in, bro. Make yourself at home. - You want one of these? - Yeah. Come on. Sit down. Take a load off. Fuck. Yeah, I had a parole violation hearing this morning. Had to go up to the Bronx and take care of some business and this fucking Lojack ratted me out. So I wrapped it up and took it with me just in case the hearing went south. Thank God it didn't. Here I am rolling cigarettes. I had to pay ten bucks each for these in the joint. Yeah, I know. Wait, this was up your ass this morning? Yeah. It was‒ It was wrapped up. You think I'd be licking this shit if it was wild in my rectum? Just smoke the fucking thing. It's free. - Am I charging you for it? - No. No. So you've been inside. You know about these things. Yeah. Remember that conversation we had? Yeah. I remember the conversation. What do you need, bro? What you working with? Right now all I got is a Beretta. Give me a week, I can get pretty much anything you want within reason. Yeah, I don't think I can wait a week right now. Youngblood's in a hurry, huh? I got ya. Come on. I'll set you up. Follow me down to the basement. That's where I keep my tools. Yo, where'd that girl go? - She left. - Why? Yo, what'd you do to her? Hey, this is my house, motherfucker. - I'll do whatever I want. - You fucking touch her? You know what? Get the fuck outta here. Hey! You step to this guy, Karl? Who the fuck are you kidding? Sit down. Sit down. - You wanna do this or what? - Yeah. Let's be quick, huh? Come on. Yo, Aurora! Get in. What are you doing? - Come on. What happened? - Fuck you, man. I don't even know you. A'ight then. I thought you were down. - Who are you? - Kelly. - Who else lives here? - My mom. And my brothers. - Aaron? - Yeah. Sometimes. - Is he home? - Yes. Why don't you go get him for me? Fuck. - Come on, motherfucker! - Get that motherfucker, man! Put him in the fucking van! You're lucky I didn't blast your whole fucking family! Bullshit. - Motherfucker! - Fuck off, bitch! Ooh. I'm not fucking playing with you! - Think I'm playing with you? - Stupid-ass motherfucker. Bullshit! Bullshit, Keith! What's that smell? There's some smoke. I think it smell like somebody cooking shit. Yo, what's he doing? Yo, look at that shit. - Oh, Fuck! - Fucking shit! Oh! Motherfuck! Get that motherfucker, man! Yo, put that shit out! A-Rock! Fuck it, man. Fuck! - That shit's out? - Yeah. All right. Get the fuck in the van, man. Yeah. There's my Scout. What's up? How you doin'? Come here. Scout. Come here. Still out? - Yes, sir. Oh! - I'll take it. All right. Spades are still out, right? Don't you growl now. That's yours. All those hearts you have, huh? Come here, Scout. Come here. Good girl. Good girl. Oh, you miss Daddy, huh? Hey. How you doin'? Scout, lay down. Lay down. Lay down. Mom ain't teach you nothin'. "Dear Keith, I tried writing this letter so many times." Scout, stay. "I tried writing this letter so many times, and I still don't know what to say. Do I need to say anything? Nobody has known me longer than you, known me better than you. And I know it's the same the other way around. In one way or another, almost half my life was spent with you. You were my family, Keith. Can you understand what it did to me when you went away? I spent the last two years getting used to living in a world without you. And now that you're free, you can go do whatever you want. I expect you to do the same. You need to adjust to a world without me, Keith. Please do not stop by unannounced. Please do not call me for no reason. Please do not come up with any excuses so that you can violate these terms. We can't pick up where we left off. You can't depend on me to be your friend or your family or anything. I really can't handle it. I hope you understand this. Please keep yourself out of trouble. Courtney." Scout, stay here, baby. Quiet. - Yeah, why not? - Mmm. You got that one. Whoa. - You're out of spades? - Really? - Bam. - Oh, you! - Shit. - You got a handful of spades. There you go. Damn it. You're out. All right. All right, all right. - Go back to clubs. - There he is, the prodigal son. - Hey, Keith. - How you doin', fellas? - Where you been? - Out. Hey, Keith, you want in? Yeah, sure. You know, I'm gonna sit the next hand out. - I need a smoke. - No, w-wait. No way you're leavin'. No, no, no. Let him go. He gets dizzy when he smokes. Don't try and stop me. I got my e-cig. - What flavor, Gilbert? - Grape. What else? C'mon. - Are these washed? - Yes, sir. Washed and cleaned. All right. You know the rules of the game? Yeah. Well, you're dealing left, but remember, we're passing right. - No, we just did that. - It's a new game. Why are we starting a new game? - Got the kid in. - Two of clubs lead? No. Left of dealer. That's not the way I learned. - House rules, baby. - And I'm the house. Yes, you are. So how's that Rocket 88, huh? Rocket 88's movin' and groovin' along in style. Love that damn car. Big-ass thing. - Yeah. - It rides nice. It's got those big back seats, big front seat, no console. You know what they used to call those? - What's that? - Baby makers. You ain't makin' no more babies. - Goddamn right I'm not. - Let's hope not. You know, I remember when I bought my first new car. I'd been working at Bethlehem Steel for six months. Bad pass. - Why is that? - You want me to shoot the moon? Well, anyway, I bet that dealer saw me coming and thought, "Here's a loser. What the fuck does this kid want?" - I didn't have any credit at the time. - Of course not. He looked at me like I was a piece of garbage. I was about to leave with my tail between my legs. And then he asked me, uh, where I worked. - I told him I worked at the Point. - Yeah. He got all excited, asked me about my brass check. - Ah, the golden ticket. - What's a brass check? Well, that's what I said, you know, but he said, um, "You know, your work ID, from the Point, where you work." So I pulled my work card out of my pocket and showed it to him. He took it, went and rubbed it, just like they did at the plant, you know? Came back with his supervisor and said I could pick any car I wanted. Nice. Man, I tell ya, working at the Point could get you anything. Except an honest retirement. - Oh! - Seriously? - Ouch. - Happens to the best of us. - What just happened? - Keith just ate the queen. - Who threw it? - Take a wild guess. - Asshole. - Yeah, no fucking kidding. What? What do you want me to do, take it easy on ya? Hold your hand? Come on, I saw the opportunity and I took it. - Stop cryin'. - Who's cryin'? You're acting like a little boy. What the fuck does that even mean? What did you just‒ - Shit. - What the hell's that? It's Scout. Scout? What is her dog doing here? It's not her dog, and it's none of your fucking business. This is my fucking house. It is my goddamn business. Whose dog it is anyway? It's my fucking dog! It's not your dog! - It's my fucking dog! - It's not your dog! Goddamn it! Give me that! Hey! Fuck!

Stay. - What happened? - I don't know. Oh, Jesus. Hi. I don't understand 'cause he doesn't have keys to the house anymore. If he broke into my house, I'm gonna have to press charges.
