I am asking, did you have lunch at mom's place? Why you silent? What? "Natasha suddenly died one week ago... and left after her... - Daughter Svetlana age of 8. -Svetlana, 8 years of old. When we had arrived at her place... Natasha said the truth about that... she'd beed burdened 5 months already. Svetka was born here. She has got Natasha's surname but... but... - But patronymic is Pasha's patronymic is Pasha's... I could adopt Svetka, but haven't confidence in my health and my own children. I have got a lot of children. And to take her to orphanage, when... when... When father is there when father is there - I cannot do this. So, decide according to your... - conscience. - according to your conscience. We'll wait for your reply for two weeks. If you don't reply... the fate of your daughter will be decided by other people. Your old friend Nikolai Melnikov. My god, you scared me. - Where is he? - He's gone. He didn't say, where. What a mistake! Her man gets some letters and she keeps them unread on the table! You supposed to read and fire it! I thought it is from sister-in-law. I need to lie down Do you understand what you ask for? Harvesting is not a meeting. And cannot be postponed. You want me to be punished? - I'll not let you down. Can you explain at least why do you need to go? I cannot. And don't want also. - Why so? I'll be back in three days. -Light up a cigarette. - Hi guys. - Hi Pavel Egorovich. - Hi Mikhalych. - good evening. You'll not go there 'coz I will not accept her If baby was yours, why didn't you go before? She would easily lure you. It means that baby isn't yours. - You don't understand. I made a proposal to her many times, even before her pregnancy. She didn't agree. Because she was elder and bad in health. and she hidden the fact of pregnancy \and left. -And if she didn't hide, then what would happen? You would leave me and marry this fright? Have you loved her? - Yes. - What "yes"? -have loved? I thought you just had fun... So what then? have loved, you say... And now want to put her girl on my neck? It will never happen, Pasha. - Where is the letter, mother? - There was no letter ever! Enough. See what the condition you put her in! What is my fault before her? I didn't know about my daughter. She isn't your daughter. And nobody forces you to call her daughter. What will we tell to people? If only you would be childless... but you have your own kids! Of course... These are mine. That one is stranger... And how can you match even? If Shura only would be cleverer and stronger in character... otherwise how she can be step-mother? My daughter needs mother. Not step-mother Alexandra is not 17 She isn't so stupid as you think. and you, mother... just like a heavy stone on her legs. Don't worry. I'll not bring my daughter here. I'll ask other people to help Did you hear that? I'm not good enough for step-mother!? Mama, listen. Tomorrow make kasha for Alyonka. Don't allow Yurka to go to river side alone. Where are you going? -With him, mom. What the people he's going to go to? So... what's this? no light, didn't lock the door..? Move a little... Listen, why to be so nervious? Not a big deal! People adopt orphans from orphanages... and she is not orphan she is not stranger. Listen... you know... I had a presentiment about it - I withdrew money today morning. for our journey. Don't want to oversleep. We won't. Ok then. Let's go. - Sveta, what year are you in? - Second year. - Do you study well? - Well. You have so beautiful purse. Show me? I knew that you'll come. I had no doubts. Listen, Mikheich... She lived all time alone? One asked for marriage. Single one. But independent. Good man. But she refused. She lived with Svetka alone... like she used to live before you. Natalia was ill often. She got poor heart after the War. All her relatives dead before her eyes. She loved Svetka. There are no words to describe her love to daughter. But she intimidated her too much... "Nobody needs you, except me"- she said. "Only own mother can love a child." They lived here. Natalia worked in post office. Pasha! We will not take anything from here. Let's go dear! Dear passengers! Please pay attention to the information about the flight. Our altitute is 10 000 m. The speed is 850 km/h The outside temperature is -35 degree. Thank you. I'll make two dresses for her. From that motley staple, remember? We will buy sandals for a while. I will quilt the blanket. Ah, listen... here... What to do with her surname? -She is my daughter and will have my surname. -That's right. But birth certificate isn't here. They didn't give me this document. - Maybe it's in her purse? - Ask her. Sveta, give me your purse. There are documents. Mother's. It is required by school. Sveta, it is required by school. It's ok. Later. Something precious is in purse. Some toy maybe. Put your bags on luggage rack. They shouldn't stand here. - I'm sorry. - Please. - All of them? -Yes. - Thank you. - Welcome. Polina! Take it. I gift it to you. I've not space enough. Put it on the sun. It likes the sun. - Hold it. - You are crazy. Such a beauty! You took 5 years to grow it! - It doesn't matter now. - Where's the girl? -She'll live in drawing room. In my drawing room. All the beauty went to ruin. Want to see? See, how it is now... Good. Sveta has her own corner. Her own room, you can say. and cannot be better... Sveta! Hello! Why are you standing here? Come, join the girls. They're going to take bath. Shurka..why did you hang a millstone about your neck! You'll not be able to manage, you have different character... and small intellect... She's not a child. Keep quiet. She doesn't look at anyone. She doesn't talk. Now he realized whom he brought. but there is no way back. It'll take long time to cast off this yoke. God's gift... -Don't stand here being all ears! Mama. What could I do? To know that there is homeless child.. when her father is alive? - You're such a fool! Could you listen to your mother if you have lack of mind? Grandma, let's go from here. Sveta! Come here! That's it. I've finished. Let's try it on! Take this one off. Just look how beautiful it is! We have to go out now. Hold it. Means, you dislike it What will you wear then? So, you disliked it... - Hello! - Hello... Together with you we'll be able to carry 5 pieces! You'll take 2 small. And I'll take 3 big. Dad will get surprised and will ask, who helped us to bring so many watermelons!? This is my teacher... Hello, Ekaterina Alexeyevna! - Hello, Shura! How are you? -We are fine. No reason to be sad. Better than others, I'd say! Will go to school. Good. Drop in, don't hesitate. Thank you. We'r going to get watermelons. And breast, and tummy... we'll wash everything... so that clean girl will walk here and there... so clean girl... so good girl... oh! Come here! Do you want to wash her? Say "Come! Join us!" She doesn't want, it means. - Hello. - Hello. - Ok, let's see later! - Of course. - Say my hello to your wife. - Thank you. - So, how's she? - not bad, getting accustomed. Pasha, I've noticed that she admires Alyonka. So I've bought this. Let's act like you've bought! - Go and put it. - What? -Doll. Where? On her bed. As it's from you. - Does it matter, WHO will put? - Put, I said! You are fool, Shura. - Really? - Yes. You're lousy bastard! Hide it wherever you want, I'll find anyway. - God's gift. - What are you saying How dare you! Who tought you these words? You are so malicious and hurting Sveta. Any other girl would complain to father about you. He will be right to beat you. She is girl. You are boy and... should protect her. She is your sister! Your blood sister! And your dad is her own dad also. - And you? - I'm mama. -But grandma says that you are step-mother. Sonny, don't listen to this. It's bad word. - Foul word? - No. Not foul. It's simply bad. -Listen, I'll tell you everything... When your dad was young. So young like... student Sasha Sotnikov. But your dad was a tractor driver already - Where have WE been? - You were not born yet. -But where have we been? -You weren't born yet. Dad didn't know me - You weren't born too? - What? Why? I was born. But dad didn't know me. But he met Sveta's mom. Then we got the letter after her death. We came there, Sveta was crying. But your dad said: "Don't cry... Don't cry, Sveta. I'm your own dad. You've got sister and brother who'll not hurt you." That's what he said. Stand in the corner! Mom, we don't need her. Ask dad to bring her back. Mama! Come here.. Mama, why do you teach Yurka such bad words? He hurts Svetka. - I do not teach him. -Really? -Well, if you sweet daughter doesn't want to accept you... it is not my fault! You can pour oil on her head - will be no effect. For her and for people you'll remain step-mother, villian. -Ok she doesn't want to accept me. But I know my Yurka very well. He's not wicked. And don't teach him these words. - Take her to orphanage... - O my god... -Or somewhere else! It's a yoke on your neck for whole life! I'll not take her anywhere. - Polina! What you dressed up for? - I'll go to the city. - Did you see Svetka? -No. - She's ran away. Let's search -Wait Mother's right. I've put this yoke on my neck myself. Maybe she didn't run at all. Everything's packed and purse isn't there! -But you said that she sleeps with purse and goes out with purse... -But I didn't ask her to go out - Shura! Look! - Oh she is here! You can go Polina.. O my god... You are my poor child. What do you want from me? Tell me... what do you want? What do you miss? Tell me and I'll do. Tell me for the god sake Well.. Let's go. Let's go home, my dear. Take your purse. Well... How are you? Good. Better than anyone else. Have bought everything? - And paints? -Paints also. - Give them to her. Give them yourself. - But for me? - Ok take this. Here are paints for you. And sketch book also. Thank you. - Keeps silent? - Yes she does. I try in different ways. But in vain. -Maybe to give her some home work? To do some shopping... -Not at all! People will say "step-mother has got the maid" - Don't listen to them. - No, Pasha, She doesn't speak to anyone. People will misunderstand... and call her "mentally defective like her mother" They laugh behind my back So then let them wag their tongues We live good, no? Better than enyone else. Sveta darling He is your dad... but you... are so shaggy-haired. -Let me braid your hair -I can do it myself. Ok fine While at home, you can manage. But you need to comb your hair when you go out. -Kolesnikova Natasha... -You have father's surname now: Olivantseva You have to respond, when teacher calls you Olivantseva Sveta. Go, my dear Maximov Alexander... Matyushina Luba... Ovchinnikova Galya... - Hello Okayomov Kolya... Olivantseva Sveta... -Hi girls. We want to eat. We're awfully hungry. - How is your daughter? - Not bad, Lyosha. Slowly gets accustomed. And your mother-in-law, Grumbles still? Why she'll grumble? My daughter isn't burden for her. She'll also get accustomed. - Didn't wait for me? - I did. But not today -I've been sent for the spares. Otherwise I wouldn't come. -That's great. Take bath and I will serve lunch -How is Sveta? So... how are you doing in school? Not bad Ok. But how to understand this? It means good or just so so? Good. Listen Sveta! Why do you behave like this? You are not small and must understand... when father's asking you... - hey it's too much! Pasha, I forgot to tell you our morning incident! -Wait, Shura! Me and Svetka... We had lost our kitten Tuzya We searched everywhere. And then I tell her: "let's check on the wardrobe". I lift her to see there, And kitten is there in the clew, got tangled with threads... Lunch is ready. Let's go - It'll get cold. - Let's go. Here is what I don't understand.. Why are you so happy? Why do smile in front of her? She doesn't want to know you. But you continuously laughing. That's truth that nothing can affect or brake you. It seems, you mother's right to call you "easy minded". Wait a moment. -I can't get it, Pavel Egorovich, by my silly mind... whom are you growling at? Was it me, who made child before marriage? Was it me, who brought her here, and put on your neck? Was it me, who said "grow her up and I will watch"? Who are you? Father or stranger? Have you asked me at least once, how do I manage with her? Have you advised something? Have you helped in something? I cannot force you to take them to cinema... what did you do for her to accept you as father? "here are paints", "here is the book" Unbelievable! It isn't true that she doesn't get accustomed. She does! I also thought that she's showing her attitude. Then I noticed, she is not happy with herself Her character is not my fault. - Then it's all my fault? - Then yes. -I work hard. Days and nights. When will I go to cinema with her? It's home it seems... Our own flat. Furniture. Television is here. Mother-in-low is not here. But she... looks at me... that I want to run away. Seems, her mother instilled something that she hates us now. She hates you and me. - Pasha, she tries! She tries as she can! -No. It is you only who really tries! All your crazy ideas... dolls... gifts... kittens on the wardrobe... instead of... You are indulging her. Can't handle this. I'm going. - Where? - Just going! - What do you mean! Fine then! Go! Hello What happened, Shura? I need... to... to talk. Come inside. Ok guys! My gongratulations for implemented plan ahead of schedule! But we have to help the neighboring farm. So, Pavel, take your team to Petrovsky region. They have technical problems. - Galya! Serve one more person. - go on your own. That's it You are free till 6 p.m and can go home.
