We won't make money even for water. Why rush? Don't you see how the village is? - We have nothing to eat. - How come? - Eat shit. That's what you'll eat. - Your mouth should be... Shut up, why are you arguing? My shoes are full of mud. I'm shaking like a tambourine. Shut up! Oh, boss... Nice calf. Where did you find one like that? And where did you find that bear? How much to sell it? I'm not selling. But I want to trade it for the bear. I agree, but the bear don't want you as a boss! I almost forgot... - Jova sends his greetings. - Which Jova? Jova... the tinsmith. - From Kutlovo village. - Huh? He said... to do that thing to me too. - Did he think of the salt? - What salt? - Do you have tin? - I don't. Do it for me, boss. For those little gypsies of mine... Five died, six are left. They're hungry, they're naked. Do it for me, boss. Give me tin. I ask you as a matether. I'll pay well. I arranged a job in three villages. Well, I can't work with a candle. I don't have any. Let me go finish the job. Don't just say that to me, boss. No one will know about this. Here, may the bear Marko die if I lie. I tell you, I don't have tin. - Don't make a scene. - Don't shout, boss. I'm not the boss! I work here. Get out of the courtyard! - Don't push me! - Get out! - Leave me! - Don't force me... - What's wrong with you? Come on, boss! Come on! You're chasing me from the courtyard? Shame on you, you black marketeer! I'll tell this to Jova the tinsmith! Shame on you! Jova the tinsmith, fuck you in the ass! - May you drop dead! - May your house be destroyed! - You gypsy... - Run! Get out of there! Gypsy business. Let me... Let me go... Let me go... Let me go... Don't... - Let me... - Don't... Let me go... No... No... Don't... Don't... Don't... Cila! Cila! Where is your calf, God damn you? Where's your calf? Where's your calf? It's not mine, you know, it's the boss's. I'll find him, I swear. That's not it. How do you know he took it to market? What else would he do? He wouldn't feed it at home! Don't worry about anything. I'll find it for sure. It's here. It must be here. He came to sell it. I know gypsy business. Can you recognise the calf? I can... I can recognise it by its eyes. - Then let's go to the office, mate. - I can't. - You must report the theft. - Please don't. I'll recognise it myself. Here it is, here it is! That's mine! Come on, let go! Let go... Hey, he's taking my calf! What, your calf? You fool! - Let go! - Let go! - Give me the calf! - But stop! Is that your calf? This is not his calf! His is... black and white. - This is a black calf! - Yes... black as if you made it, your gypsy mother! Give me water! Give me water to see! Give me water! Is it black now? Thief! Radomir... you are an old and honest man. I respect you like a father. But if it turns out your ?ivko to be in the Partisans, by God, I'll kill you. Not even a dog will be left to bark in front of your house. Is that clear? I won't lie to you, Krasic. I don't know where he is. Then... is this him? Yes, it is, by God. - No, it's not. - It is, if I say so. Who else would it be? Katic... you see if this is him. - What? - This. Yes, it's him. Priest Grujic from Kutlovo. I'm telling you nicely. I know priest Grujic. He comes to my house. He cut my patron saint's cake. Why is priest Grujic's picture in your house, Radomir? We are some kind... of relatives. Relatives? And is he one of those Grujics from Studenica or from the Grivacka side? - From Grivacka. We're related to him by the late Dobrica, Bo?a's uncle. Alright, alright... Let's go. Come on. Separate the large cattle from the small ones. Take them straight to the train station for loading. Mr. Housekeeper, do you have livestock? Sheep, goats, cows? Do you understand? Do you understand me? In the barn. Faster. Is that all the livestock you have? Is that all? Do you understand? I don't have any more. Just that cow. That's all I have. What's that over there? Something strange about that. What do we have here? Get it out. No, leave it to them, to have something to eat. Search the whole house. Chetniks say the house is suspicious. Don't leave any surprises. - How far is it from here to U?ice? - At least 25 kilometres. - What? It must be more. - We'll come back by truck. - How do you know? - I don't know, I guess. That's not certain. - What is this, Housekeeper? - Mr. Housekeeper is a collector. - He collects weapons. - But his collection is incomplete. We should add to it. That's for his son in the Partisans. Isn't that right, Mr. Housekeeper? Out with the women! Out with them! We can't do anything about it, my housekeeper. You signed the death warrant yourself. Inform headquarters that we found a weapon in this village. - Let them search the whole village. - Yes sir, Captain. Come on, move faster! Faster! Faster! Forward! Faster! Forward! Forward! Faster! Dana... Dana! - Forward! - Faster, dogs! Faster! Voco... Voco! Guard! Guard! Come here! Get these children! Go away... What the... Hey, you, you... come here. You, you! Come closer. What are you afraid of? I won't bite you. Bro... And... what does it say above you? What does it say... It says I'm the most beautiful guy in the village. THIS BLACK MARKETEER AND VILLAIN OF THE SERBIAN PEOPLE SOLD GREASE IN A BUCKET MIXED WITH LIME I don't really think so. You got a knife? Do you have a knife? Do you hear what I'm asking, are you deaf? Then untie me with your hands. Faster, what are you looking at? Come on! Hurry... What are you doing here? I come to sell the calf. Is today Friday, market day? Why? I don't know. Untie faster, God damn you. What are you doing here? Stop! Stop! Stop! He's running away! Guard! Guard! Stop! Stop! I'll shoot! Stop! He's running away! Stop! Instead of your two hands, An ammo belt squeezes me now. Instead of your two hands, An ammunition belt squeezes me now. Instead of your slender figure, My beard goes to my waist. Instead of your slender figure, My beard goes to my waist. Hey, where are you? Voco... Voco! Voco... Where are you? Voco... Voco... Stop. It's me. - Anything new? - There were gunshots over there. You go down. And... they say to hurry up. Bread... Where did you come from, damn it? Come... Here. Take it. Wait, slowly! - How many days haven't you eaten? - I don't know. Then you have to take it slowly, crumb by crumb. Chew well. Chew well, it should melt, then swallow that juice. Swallow the juice. If you swallow the hard... you'll die on the spot. Like that... Where were you going? I don't know. You're running away? I'm running. Running from who? I don't know. - You're not joining the Partisans? - No, no. - The Chetniks? - No. How come? So you have to pick a side. And you? Whose side are you on? Why are you mocking me? Because of the cockade? I'm... a simple man. A housekeeper. They ordered me to go on guard like the others in the village. I say... I'm a simple man. I don't know how... to judge which is the right side. Who knows if that even exists? OK, what to do with you? I can't let you go. If I bring you down... you'll get a bullet in the head. That's how they treat tramps. It's war. I have to bring you. You won't do that. What won't I do? How do you know I won't? - I know... - What would you do? Let you go, and then I lose my head? Hey, where are you going? I'm going... May the devil take you! And... don't go this way. There's another guard. Don't go there either... There are Germans. And not along the stream, you'll run into Partisans. But... this way. This way you'll get out somehow. Hello, boss! It's nice that I met you! Let me through. - Don't hold me back. - You're a strange man, boss! You don't want company? My legs won't hold me any more. Where were you going? - Let me go... - Don't you care about old friends? God bless you. Hey, wait! Stop! Don't rush, boss. The wife isn't waiting for you. I told you nicely back then... we'll buy that calf of yours... and you said... let's trade for Marko. Come on... we'll give you Marko, - and you give us the calf! - No. - Where is Marko? - Here's Marko. Come on, Marko... Come on, Marko... introduce yourself to the boss. Marko! Come on! - Voco... - Come on! Hey, stop, boss! Run, boss! Boss! Boss! Stop, boss! Hey, boss! - Give me the rope! - Let go... Don't ... No, don't! He hit me! Get up, he wants to run away! Hold on! Hold him, run! Hurry! Why are you dragging like an old woman? Come on... hurry. Where is he? - Where is he? - He's somewhere. Maybe he hid under a log. I don't see him. Right, right... Huh? - He's nowhere to be found. - Stop! Stop! - Germans! - Germans! - Mr. Commander... - Gypsies! Schultz, shoot them now! Mr. Commander, we're Serbs, we're not Gypsies, Mr. Commander. Please, Mr. Commander... I kiss your boots, I kiss your hands, Mr. Commander... We are poor people... We're Serbs, Mr. Commander. We're Serbs! Serbs! Don't, please... Don't, please... Shoot them with rifles, not the machine gun! Quickly! Gypsy grief is too great Nobody knows what's in store for the Gypsy Gypsy grief is too great Nobody knows what's in store for the Gypsy Fire! Where are you from? From Veliki ?evar village. Did you meet the Chetniks? I didn't. And the Germans? Nope. Where did you get that calf? It's mine. Will you give it to us? No, I won't give my Voco. - I won't. - Then we'll take it from you. Huh? - What's its name? - Voco. Did you name it? I did, who else? Hey, where did that veal fall from the sky? - Leave it. - Actually, we'll buy the calf. Here, I'll write you a receipt to have in black and white that we took your calf. So when the war is over, you go to the municipality, show the receipt and choose what you like: calf or money. Fuck that. The calf isn't for sale. I don't need your receipt. Why won't you sell? Am I supposed to beg you? These people are starving and you're haggling? - Leave it! - What? - Leave it! - Get away, mate! - You want to take the calf by force! - Enough! Enough! - I won't! Enough, let him go if he won't. We won't take by force. Come on, break it up! Not another word about the calf. How are you not ashamed, you blockhead? Can't you see the people's eyes are white with hunger, mate? Where are you going? - I'd like... to go. - You'll go, don't be afraid. But not now. When we tell you. Congratulations, mate... You're a force, mate! Is it greasy? You're a force, by God! Can I... water the calf? - You, are you thirsty? - No. Thank you. Are you coming from the town, son? No. And is this your calf? Yes, it's mine. Mine, mine. Are you going to the market? No. Well, thank you and goodbye. Are you hungry, son? - No. - Come to the house. Come to the house! Leave the calf. Come to the house. Warm up. Come on. Come in. Sit there. Come on. Sit down, sit down. Give him some milk. We're waiting for news from the city. My son was imprisoned. He was wrongly accused. May their flesh fall off, by God. They say he joined the Partisans. They took him... His young wife remained. The children were educated in the city. Here she is... My daughter-in-law Smilja... She just arrived near the end of school year... when the war mateke out. Do you want more? Eat, eat. Where's the calf? You eat. I'll see to it. And so the children dropped out of school. They took refuge here with me but it didn't help. They found him and took him away, innocent. Since they took him, we haven't heard any news. Not a letter, nothing. If only I knew where he is. To bring him some clothes. Winter is coming, and he was taken in light clothes. I put it in the barn. I laid hay for it. It's very hungry... Poor man... Take him down. Let him lie down. Let him rest. Voco... Voco... Get away! Come on, Voco. Come on. - Brother... - Huh? What is it? Bro... Give this to Jela. - Do it yourself. She's in the house. - No, no. I won't. Come on, take it. Here, a man mateught this. - Read! - I can't. You read. "Announcement. This informs that the Bolshevik bandits..." Oh, Dra?ko! My Dra?ko! My Dra?...! Son... ANNOUNCEMENT THEY WERE SHOT IN RETRIBUTION Thank God, we finally arrived. - Let's go inside, please. - Thank you. Hello, Landlady. It was decided that the gentlemen officers stay here. Make sure they get settled upstairs. Don't worry, Landlady... you'll be paid for everything. You don't lose anything. Full comfort, like at Baden-Baden. Let's get them settled in the house. Let's go inside, please. Is this all you have? They will sleep here... and a radio station will be set up above. And you must move to the barn. They'll set up tarps for you. How long will they stay here? Well... until the bridge down at the tunnel is repaired which the Partisans mined. These are engineers. Goodbye. Balkan comfort. But, Captain, each dog finds its own tree. Shall I set up the antenna? Of course. We must listen to London this evening. Who is he? Who is this gentleman? Do you understand me? Son... That's my son. This is his wife. Oh, I understand. He is your son. Come here, son. Go on. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Don't. - Let me go. Mother! Mother Jela! You want to leave? What can I tell the Germans? Where is my son? Voco... He doesn't want to? But why not? You must drink. Today is my birthday. Try it. Yes? It's great, isn't it? What did I tell you? Real cognac. Mr. Housekeeper, why aren't you with the Partisans? Partisans. Do you understand? Why aren't you a soldier? Mobilization. The army. Do you understand? The army. Understand? I am disabled. I don't have a kidney. They removed my kidney. What does he say? He says he's disabled. He has only one kidney. Luckily, they left his bladder. Mr. Housekeeper, would you sing us something? - Serbs sing very nicely. - I didn't know. Sing. Do you understand? Watch this... Sing, Mr. Housekeeper. Don't be ashamed. You must sing something for us. They tell you to sing. Black mountain Saves my sheep So I can go down, oh mountain Down to the girl Black mountain Saves my sheep So I can go down, oh mountain Down to the girl So I can ask her, oh mountain Would she go for me? Or for me, oh mountain... Nice, nice. Very nice. - Let me through. - Please. Hold on. The old lady will stay here. - You will stay here. - You'll sleep here in bed. You don't understand at all? Please... Otto, imagine a night ... with his wife... in fresh hay. - Good night. - Good night, ma'am. You'll get yourself killed. Don't cry. Calm down. - Did you make contact with the centre? - Yes. But the old code doesn't seem to be valid any more. I'm telling you, it all went to hell! These cigars smell horrible. Mother Jela! No, Mother Jela! Don't go so fast! I can't... Where are you going? What's your name? - Cila. - Where are you from? From Veliki ?evar. What do you do there? I worked around the cattle at boss Radomir's. Why are you dragging around someone else's calf? It's not someone else's, it's mine. It's mine now. Shall we go to my village? - Where is it? - The house is big, and empty. My father and matethers went away. It's war. Do you want to? Hey... Sit there, I'll go water the calf. I'll be right back. - Don't leave me alone. - Sit there. Patrols come by here and shoot right away. No, I beg you. Is the calf more important than me? It's thirsty! Come on, wait here. I'll be right back. Don't come get me! But why? I don't want to go with you! The calf is enough for you! Smilja! Stop! Smilja! Smilja! Smilja! Smilja! Are you the one with the calf? ?arko, come, by God, I'll show you something. Well, you're the one, damn you! Come, let's kiss each other, mate! Where have you been, mate? Look what a man he is. He fed the calf for us to this day. Come on, Voco! Come on, Voco! Let's go! Comrades! I invited you to the city today where we will buy livestock for the needs of our Army and the Red Army. The quartermasters of the Red Army will pay immediately. Our quartermasters will take the livestock and payment will be made at a later date. Those whose livestock is taken will get a certificate guaranteed by the State. Is that clear? No one should hide livestock. A commission has been appointed to visit the villages. Whoever is found to have hidden livestock will be punished. We know, comrades, that it's difficult for everyone now. But it is our duty to help our Army. Let the purchase be done. Stay in your places and the quartermasters will work. Hi, ?arko. What is this? You've arrived, Comrade Captain. Hello, hello. Hello. - What's this? - We're purchasing. We started. No, it can't be that way, Comrade Captain. You must make a commission. Then you're the chairman, Comrade Captain. Thank you, thank you. And you're the vice president. What kind of market is this without money? Give me... Here's the money, Comrade Captain, here. - That's money? - Yes. Money? It's good. And here are the young ones. It's good. It's good... Come here. They gave a receipt. - They'll pay. - I guess they'll pay. It wouldn't be nice if they happened to not pay. If you get a receipt, they will definitely pay. Hello! Hello! Is that the City Command? Give me Ne?ic. Ljuba Ne?ic. Yes, yes... Where is he? Who? I can't hear! Is that Ljuba? OK, whatever, but fix up hay carts for the livestock. The cattle will starve to death! Who? No, he hasn't! He hasn't, he hasn't! Let them bring the hay! Who? Desimir! Are you deaf, Desimir? Good! Hey! Hey! Comrade Captain, we mateught these for theft. This one stole a calf. ?arko... Look, for God's sake, what will you do with this? I saw it with my own eyes when he took the calf. Tell me where you hid the calf. I didn't steal it, it's mine. It's better to say now than to go before the Military Court. All right, I hid it in the lime kiln. - Go get the calf. - Understood. Hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute. You stay here too. Hello, mate. How are you? What are you doing? Do you want a cigar? Come on. - No. - Here. - I can't. - Why are you so out of sorts? Because of the calf? Huh? See the guy over there... The Partisans took his shop and his house, but he doesn't cry like you. And... see the one over there... He kept a matethel for the Germans in the tavern. Business as usual... What is that? And this one here... is unjustly held in the prison. - Go away! Guard! Hey, guard! Guard! What is it? Why are you shouting? Go tell them to take the calf. It's in the cemetery. Just so it doesn't starve. It's true, I swear by my life. I hid it in the cemetery. Go tell them to get it out of the earth. Let them take it wherever they want! Just so it doesn't starve! You cheated us once with that calf, you won't do it again! Comrades! Friends! Victory! Belgrade is liberated! Victory, victory, friends! Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory... Victory over the German devil! Mr. General, my husband was wrongly imprisoned because of a calf. Let him go. - Let him go. - What did you say, girl? My husband was imprisoned. He's in jail. Let him go. Why are you begging me, girl? There's your captain. He will solve it. - Run away. - Who fired? Run away. Don't go there. Not there, you fool! Mr. Captain, I'm sorry about this misunderstanding. We are the 208th platoon of the 4th Division. I and my lieutenants come to surrender. Do you know... that your division capitulated? - Yes, I know, Captain. Then why did you... shoot at us? The members of the Waffen-SS who joined our unit fired. They opened fire without my order. They were provoked by your mood. Mr. Captain, order the guilty to be punished. Order your men... to lay down... their arms. Put down your weapons! Voco... THE END
