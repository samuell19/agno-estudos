(suspenseful music) - [Brian] Oh, no. (engine chugging) (groaning) (insects chirping) (wolf growling) (suspenseful music) (wolf snarling) (tense music) (glass shattering) (Brian screaming) (exciting music) (sirens wailing) - Have Ernie call me when he checks the body. - Will do. All right, come on, let's get him on the stretcher. - Find the registration? - Yeah. From Los Angeles. - Let me see. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Hey, Vern. Come on in, glad to see you. Hey, you didn't, uh, come all the way out here because of that parking ticket I got the other day, did ya? Have a little coffee, it's fresh. (Vernon sighing) - John, there's been a murder. - [John] Who? - A man called Hammond. A salesman from Los Angeles. - [John] Where'd it happen? - Out on Vasquez Road. He must have made a wrong turn last night and ran out of gas. - Yeah? - Something attacked him in his car. - Something, what do you mean something? - That's it, we don't know what it was. But it practically tore off the roof, broke through the windshield, and mangled his body his so badly, he didn't even look human. Now, we found some tracks. I'd like you to take a look at them. - Sure, come on. - Well? (siren wailing) - The way you describe the killing makes it sound like a leopard. - These aren't leopard tracks, are they? (dogs barking) - No, no. They bear some resemblance to the tracks of a wolf, but it'd have to be enormous. Look how deep that claw mark is. - Yeah? - No, no, it can't be a wolf, because even allowing for the possibility of size, the pads are different. You see, that's not a wolf pad. Listen, I think we oughta get Byron in on this. Why don't you give him a call? - Mr. Byron is busy. - You asked him? - Yeah, I asked him. (dramatic music) Joe. What's the matter with 'em? - I don't know. It's just as if the animal changed its scent. - How can an animal change its scent? That doesn't make sense, does it? - No, there isn't any water around here that it could have crossed. - Hey, what kind of an animal are we lookin' for, anyway? First, it nearly rips the roof off that car, then it breaks through the windshield and tears up that guy like it did. Now its scent disappears. What did it do, fly away? - Charlie, go help with the dogs. - [Charlie] I'm sorry. - Well, what did it do? (people chattering quietly) - [Sandy] Thank you. - Hi, Sandy. - Coffee, sir? - "Coffee, sir"? Um, no. Dinner, Friday night. - Sorry, that's out of stock. - [John] Oh (chuckles) you're angry at me. - No, I like not hear from you for weeks at a time. - [John] Oh, come on Sandy, you know I'm working on a book. I haven't been out of the house in three weeks. - I didn't know that paralyzed your dialing finger. - Oh, uh... I should have phoned, and I didn't phone. However... - I'm busy Friday night. I have to grind coffee beans. - Dinner Friday night, that has got to be more interesting than grinding coffee beans. Just a little bit, hmm? (both chuckling) - I don't know why I let you do this to me. (insects chirping) (leaves rustling) (suspenseful music) (wolf growling) (tense music) (wolf barking and snarling) (man screaming) (exciting music) (sirens wailing) - [Vernon] I want to show you something. (suspenseful music) - His whole face is gone! - Yeah, I know. Again. - They've changed. - What do you mean, they've changed? - The animal ran to that point, and then it started walking, and when it walked, it walked on two legs. - [Police Dispatch] Mission's going from across from 3933 24th Street to 915 at the northern range-- - They're gone. - From 3933 24th Street... - Wait a minute, are you trying to tell me that thing flew away again? - Well, take your choice. Would you rather believe it erased its own tracks? Vern, any way you look at it, the tracks go from four feet to two feet to nothing, period. (suspenseful music) I'm sorry Vern, I haven't been much help, and I know it. - You did the best you could, and nobody could have followed those tracks any better than you. - I don't know. I think maybe this afternoon, I'm gonna take a drive out to Byron's and see if he has any suggestions. - Good luck. - Ah, he's not that bad. You just have to know him. - Uh huh. Well, if he tells you anything, let me know. - I will. Thanks for the lift. - John... You're absolutely certain you don't know what kind of an animal it was? - No. But there is something else. - But what? - When the animal was walking, its tracks were deeper than they should have been. - [Vernon] I don't follow you. - Well, look, when it was running on all fours, it left the track of an animal weighing 100 pounds or so. - [Vernon] So what? - When it walked upright on two legs, it weighed more than I do. (birds chirping) (soft thudding) - I thought you might be around. - I should have known I can't sneak up on you. - John, how are you? - Fine, Byron. - So, Bell has persuaded you to join the hunt, then. - How'd you know? - Why else would you be here? (chuckling) Besides, I saw your name in the newspaper. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm uh, in on it. - Good. At least you haven't entirely lost your urge to action, then. John, it's good to see you. Come on inside. - It's been a long time, Byron. What have you been doing with yourself? - Well, I'm getting ready for my trip to South America. - I thought you were going to Africa? - South America's better. It's less familiar, more demanding. I plan to cross the Mato Grosso country there. - Mato Grosso? A lot of people have disappeared in there. - Yes, I know. - How's the hunting business? - Lucrative. How's the, uh, story writing business? - It's a living. - I see. How about a scotch? - Sure. Hello, Grant, how are you? - Very well, thank you, Mr. Wetherby. It's been a long time. It's good to see you again, sir. You're looking quite well. - Thank you, good to see you. - So, tell me about this killer animal. You've seen its tracks? - [John] Yeah. - [Byron] And? - I don't know. Thanks. - [Byron] Couldn't identify it? - Well, the tracks look something like a wolf, but I don't think it's a wolf. - [Byron] What do you think it is? - (chuckles) You tell me. It changed its scent, Byron, so the dogs couldn't follow it. It ran on four legs, walked upright on two, and then erased its own tracks. - But that's fantastic. - Then help me find it. - I can't, I've got too much to do to get ready for my trip. - You can't find time for something like this? That's hard to believe. - I'm busy, John. So, what else? Have there been further signs of this animal since the killing? - Make that plural. They've got its second victim last night. - Where? - [John] About a mile from the first killing. - Same method of kill? - The same method of mangle would be a better description. - If both killings occurred within a mile of each other, that narrows down the field. Undoubtedly, the animal's got a cave within that area. That limitation should help you to find it before it kills a third time. - A third time? - You know that once an animal starts killing humans, it never stops. (suspenseful music) (man and woman laughing) (quiet rustling) - Oh, no! Do you see anything? The front door's locked, isn't it? - [Man] Yeah, it's locked. I'll go check and make sure it's locked. - [Woman] I'm coming with you. (insects chirping) - Who's out there? You better not have any funny ideas. I got a gun in here! (suspenseful music) I know someone is out there. (woman screaming) (glass shattering) (wolf snarling) (man screaming) (suspenseful music) (pleasant jazz music) (people chattering quietly) - [John] If it keeps up like this, they're gonna have to close the place. - It's always jammed here Friday night. - Thank you. Yeah, not now. Not now. - No one has any idea where this animal comes from? - Sandy, nobody has any idea what this animal is, much less where it comes from. Now, in 20 years of hunting, I have never run across a predator even remotely like this one, and it's driving me nuts that I can't run it down. - Then why doesn't your friend Byron help you? - I don't know. I don't know how he can resist the challenge. (people chattering quietly) - You know, I may go to my grave not understanding how the two of you could be so close for so many years. - You have to understand that he's a-- - Speak of the devil. - Hmm? - Here he comes. - [John] Byron. - Good evening. I came into town to get some supplies, but the stores are closed. Thought I'd drop in for a drink. Don't worry, I'm not gonna join you. - Oh, sit down. Yeah, come on, sit down. - Was I right? - About what? - The animal killing again. - Yeah, yes you were. - Fascinating creature, whatever it is. - You find it fascinating that four human beings have been slaughtered? - Some people are saying it was a werewolf. Did you know that? - Yes, yeah, I heard that. - Now, don't scoff. Remember that wolf we went after in Canada? How the Indians say that it wasn't a wolf at all, but a trapper that turned into a wolf? - Mm-hmm. - Now there was an animal. - There was a man-killer. - You never could accept that the life of a predator is superior to that of its victim, could you? - What? - I said he could never appreciate-- - I-I heard what you said. It's believing you that I'm having trouble with. - That's a lovely dress you're wearing. (John chuckling) - Well, Byron and I never really thought too much alike. - We almost did once. But you preferred to wait in the trees. - Yeah, well the, uh, the allure that mortal danger holds for you always left me a little bit cool. - But only in mortal danger are we alive, John. Only by risking our lives can we truly appreciate. What kind of a life are you leading now? What kind of a life is anyone around here leading now? Emasculated by society and safety? - Well, uh, we're enjoying it. (John chuckling) - I give life, as well as take it. The animals I kill are never more alive than in that instant before my bullet strikes it. - Come on. - I'm never more alive than in that instant, when they could kill me just as easily. - I couldn't help overhearing you, sir. You're a hunter, aren't you? - Why do you wanna know? - Perhaps you could tell me what the pleasure is that full grown and presumably intelligent men get from murdering defenseless animals? - Now, look, I think you better just, uh-- - I didn't meant to intrude, of course, but tell me. Is it a sense of power? A sense of accomplishment? Or is it a regression to the past, when killing animals was a way of life? Sir? - I couldn't tell you that. - I thought not. I thought not, sir. - I could show you, though. - I beg your pardon? - The pleasure I get from killing. I could show you what that is, though I'd doubt you'd die with the nobility of an animal. Shall I show you? Shall I? - Byron... (chuckles) Hey, you're good, you almost had me convinced. - It would have been so easy. (Byron chuckling) (suspenseful music) - He's crazy, I'm telling you. - He's always been like that, Sandy. He's got a strange sense of humor. - That's humor? - If were up to him, it is, yes. You don't know him that well. You haven't seen the things that he's done. You know that wolf he was talking about, the-the one in Canada? - What about I? - Well, in order to kill it, he waited for it all night on the ground, beside some bait. The killer wolf's a real terror. I waited up in a tree. - That's where anyone in his right mind would wait. - Well, not according to Byron. See, the wolf had to have the same chance to live that he did. - Him, with a rifle? - With one bullet in it. - Oh, am I suppose to admire that? - Well, not admire it maybe, but respect it. And he got badly bitten by that wolf. We were so close together, I couldn't get in a shot. Byron finished it off with a hunting knife. He came very close to dying. (insects chirping) (water running) (waves lapping) (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) - [John] Hello? - John... I think there's someone crawling around outside. I thought I heard something when I, when I was in the bedroom, and I went into the kitchen, and well, I looked out the window, and I-I thought I saw something. No, I'm not being silly. John, you've gotta come over. - [John] I'll be right over. (loud crashing) (tense music) (wood breaking) (wolf snarling) (Sandy shouting) (wood breaking) (Sandy screaming) (sirens wailing) (police radio chattering quietly) - We came as soon as you called, Mr. Wetherby. She's in the bedroom. - She was very lucky. You must have scared it away before it got through the door. She never saw it. Now tell me, what could have done this? - [John] Let's look outside. - [Officer] Sheriff? Come here a minute, will ya? Can you believe it? Look where they go. (waves crashing) - [John] We're wasting our time trying to follow that animal, Vern. We're gonna have to attract it. - [Vernon] You mean, set traps? - No, I'm not talking about traps. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sandy. I want you to get some things together. You're gonna stay at my place for a while, okay? (suspenseful music) - [Vernon] Correct me if I'm wrong, John, but I got a feeling you're going out looking for this animal yourself. - [John] What else is left to do? - I'm putting out a curfew. No one in the hills after dark. I expect you to abide by it like everyone else. - I'll see you, Vern. (insects chirping) (night birds calling) (tense music) - [Vernon] Evening, John. I guess you forgot about the curfew. (dramatic music) - [John] Sandy? - Well, I was worried about you. What did you want me to do? - Well, I didn't want you to call the sheriff. I'm very capable of taking care of myself, Sandy. - Then I'm sorry, I didn't realize my caring about you would be so upsetting. - It's all right, I'm tired. I'm going home to get some sleep. I'll see you later. - John? - Hmm? - You're not gonna like this. - Well then, don't tell me. - I think it's Byron. - What's Byron? - I think he's behind the killings. Well, why was I attacked right after we saw him in the restaurant? Well, you told me he was badly bitten by a wolf in Canada, and you also said-- - Oh, you're not gonna start that werewolf business, are ya? - Well, I don't know what I'm starting, or what I believe, but he said that the wolf had-- - Hi. Am I interrupting anything? - No, no, no. Now, I'm gonna get some sleep. Do not go back to your house. - Goodbye, Sandy. What was that all about? - Uh, nothing. - It didn't sound like nothing. What was that about a werewolf? - She said that she tells you everything. She's decided that Byron's a werewolf. How about that? You're not laughing, Vernon. (suspenseful music) - John, I wonder if you'd ride out to Byron's with me this afternoon? - What for? - Just to talk to him. I'll pick you up about two o'clock, all right? - Whatever you say, Vern. - Interesting. - That's all you've got to say? - What would you like for me to say? - Well, how about you'll be glad to help us? - It's not my concern. - I don't get you. Four of your neighbors have been violently killed in the last 10 days, and that is not your concern? - Ah, you're angry. That's good, I like to see a man in anger. It's a living emotion. - Living emotion? What the hell are you talking about? Are you gonna help us or not? - I'm not. - Thank you very much, Mr. Byron. That's all I wanted to know. I'll be seeing you. (chuckling) - Doesn't any of this bother you at all? - No, I'm enjoying it. - Enjoying it? - Yes, enjoying it. I'm enjoying seeing people feel anger, fear, agitation. It means they're alive, John. Maybe for the first time in years. John. Just in case you're thinking about going after that animal yourself, a good hunter is never sure of anything except that his prey will do the unexpected. (suspenseful music) - That is some friend you've got there. - No, he's not my friend. I wonder if he ever was. - Who's the guy that works for him? - Grant? What about him? - The whole time we were there, he was watching us. - Yeah, he's a little odd, but then so is his master. You know how Byron hired him? - Uh uh. - They met in a bar one night and they got to drinking, and Byron pulled one of his old stunts, he was gonna arm wrestle him for the drinks. Always had a big thing about arm wrestling. Well, it took him 10 minutes to put Grant down, and that impressed him so much, he hired him. - Your weird friend doesn't know it, but I'm gonna keep a close eye on him from now on. (suspenseful music) - [Charlie] Well, what's the matter? - [Vernon] Charlie, are you crazy sneaking up on me? (Charlie laughing) - [Charlie] Getting a little edgy in your old age, huh? - [Vernon] That is not funny. - [Charlie] Anything happening? - No, nothing. Look, keep an eye on the place. I'll see you tomorrow. - [Charlie] Right. (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (soft clattering) (gun cocking) (chains rattling) (door creaking) (wolf growling and snarling) (gun firing) (Charlie screaming) (wolf howling) (suspenseful music) (exciting music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (exciting music) (sirens wailing) (people chattering quietly) - All right, any further questions? - Yes. Why don't you answer the first question? Somebody's got to know what's killing these people. - Gentlemen, you've been told what it is. An animal of some sort. - An animal outmaneuvering your entire department? How big a fool do you think we are out here? (people exclaiming loudly) (gavel banging) - I just received a wire from Sacramento. The governor's declared this area in a state of emergency. The National Guard will be brought in. - Armed with silver bullets? (people laughing) (gavel banging) - Now, some of you may think this situation is very funny, but we don't. There have been five brutal slayings, including one of our own men. We don't find that very humorous. Now, the National Guard will commence operations within three days. End of report. (people chattering quietly) - [Reporter] Is it true you heard the howling of a wolf last night, Mr. Wetherby? - Yes. - [Reporter] Do you think the killer is a wolf? - No. - [Reporter] A werewolf? - Look, you got everything you need inside. - [Reporter] Look, I just want to have a word-- - I told you to get out of here! This town is really stirred up. - It sure is. - Well, I'm glad the governor called the Guard in. - Yeah. - What's the matter? Don't you think they'll be any help? - No, I don't. - [Vernon] That's good news, John. - [John] Yeah. - Well, I'll see you later. Goodbye, Sandy. - Bye, Vern. - Quite a turnout. - What are you doing here, Byron? - Since seven o'clock this morning, I've been answering your Sheriff Bell's questions. - I gotta tell you something. Before this is over, you're gonna be answering a lot more. - You know where I live, sheriff. But next time, I suggest you bring a warrant. - John, I've gotta go back inside. Will you wait for me? - Sure. - Look at those faces. - Yeah, don't tell me, they're alive. - Alive with fear. Alert to the possibility of death hanging over their heads. - And you think that's just marvelous? - It is marvelous, John. When is a man more alive than on his way to the gallows? What cigarette tastes as good as that last one while the firing squad is waiting? You know, in a way, these killings may be a benefit to everybody. Well... Good seeing you again, John, Sandy. - It's him, I know it's him. - I almost wish it were. - Can't you admit that it's even possible? - What, that Byron's a werewolf? - I never said that, I said-- - Well, what did you say? What do you want from me? - A little common sense. If Byron isn't involved, and he's such a good friend, why does he keep refusing to help you? - I guess there's only one way that I'm gonna satisfy you. - Oh, Mr. Wetherby. How are you, sir? Come in. - Twice in one day? To what do I owe the pleasure? - It's time for you to help me find the animal, Byron. You can't tell me it's not your concern anymore. - Excuse me, sir. - John, can't you understand why I haven't involved myself? - [John] No, I can't. - Well, I guess I'll have to tell you. Because I hate to see you so much less a man than you were. Because I was hoping that letting you work on the problem unaided might help you to regain some portion of your once consummate skill as a hunter. - That is why you haven't helped? - You sound surprised. - Byron, people are being killed. The deputy sheriff has been killed. Now what the devil difference does it make if I regain my hunting skills or not? The whole area is in panic, and you're talking to me about hunting skills? - You're too involved, John. That's why you can't locate the animal. All you're concerned about is finding it before it kills again. - How foolish of me, how very un-hunter-like. Now, are you gonna help me find it? - The last time we tried this, it took me seven minutes to put your arm down. Well, and of course, that was years ago. - I don't understand you. - Of course you don't. Can you still last seven minutes? Five minutes? John, if you can hold my arm for one minute, I'll help you. - Byron, we are talking about killings, not about children's games! - Basic games, John. The way in which I choose to judge my fellow man. - That's all these deaths mean to you? - You matter to me, not those drudges who got themselves killed. Well? Can't you even hold me for a minute now? Is that how far gone you are? Good, John. Tell me when you're ready. - Now. (stopwatch ticking) - 20 seconds. (John struggling) 45 seconds. 55 seconds, John. Forget about that animal. Even if you found it, it would only kill you. (suspenseful music) - Well? I presume he said no. - Damn well he did. - [Sandy] And? - And I am going to have a drink, and a nap. And... - But not consider for a moment he might be guilty? - [John] No, no more, Sandy. It's time to go. - John, please, don't go. (doorbell ringing) - I changed my mind. I thought it might be fun, like old times. - Okay. - John, don't go with him. - What's the matter? Don't you want me to help him? - Just a minute. Come here. Now, what is the matter with you? You've done nothing but ask him why he wasn't wiling to help, and now that he is willing, you want me to turn him down? What is that? - John, I'm afraid of him. Why'd he change his mind? - I need his help, Sandy. - No, John, it's more than that. - What are you talking about? - You'd go with him, even if you knew he was the killer. - Now, don't you worry. I'm gonna take real good care of him. (suspenseful music) - What would you do, John, if you found out it really was a werewolf you were after? (John chuckling) No, I'm serious. Would it explain the tracks? Think about it. A wolf-like creature running on all fours undergoes a transformation. Now, it's a heavier two-legged creature, but it hasn't changed completely yet, so the tracks are still unfamiliar. Finally, the two-legged creature turns into a man, who, in order to protect himself, obliterates his footprints. Doesn't that make sense? - It makes a wonderful story, Byron. - Yes, doesn't it? - [John] Let's get outta here. - Shall we separate now? - [John] Mm-hmm. - I'll make a sweep through those hills that side of the creek, meet you farther down where it runs into the road. - All right, I'll take this side. - Good luck, John. Don't forget what I told you. A good hunter's never sure of anything except that-- - Yeah, I know, except that his prey will do the unexpected. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (wolf growling and snarling) (tense music) Byron! (suspenseful music) Oh, Byron... (wolf howling) (suspenseful music) (soft clattering) Grant? Grant, listen to me. I know. I found Byron's body. - [Byron] Did you really? Put the rifle down, John. On the table. Now. Back up, John, against the wall. Thank you. - That was Grant's body in your clothes, wasn't it? - He threatened to tell the police about me. And it did provide for a stunning moment, didn't it? Aren't you at all curious as to how I did it? - All right. How did you do it? - The basement stairs, John. Erasing the tracks was nothing, of course. Changing the scent, obvious. There were two of us. The switch is on your left, John. And uh, watch your step, it's a little steep. The two-legged tracks, I made myself. A simple matter of borrowing claws and footpads from some of my trophies, and placing them to the bottoms of the pair of my boots. Most perplexing to you, naturally. You were correct about the four-legged tracks, though. But what you didn't realize was that I'd burned and scarred them to make it more difficult. In there. (wolf growling and snarling) Easy, boy, easy. Easy, fella, easy, it's all right. - What have you done to him? - I taught him how to kill another kind of prey. Of course, I gave him a little help with windshields and doors, making sure not to leave any tracks. - But why, Byron? - I've already told you why, John. To give these rustic clods some reason for existence. To fill their empty minds with so much terror that even they come alive. And to bring my old friend back to me again. Maybe he's not the man he used to be, but we can work on that. Revitalize old muscles, bring back old instincts. - Byron, don't you realize you have murdered six human beings? - I could have made it seven, John. (wolf snarling and barking) But I didn't want to kill your lady friend. I just wanted to arouse you. - And now? - You remember where you found that deputy's body in the clearing nearby? - [John] Yes. (chucking) - It won't do you any good, John. It's empty. (rifle cocking) (Byron laughing) There's a shell box lying on top of a log in that clearing with two shells in it. I put 'em there earlier this evening. One for him. (wolf snarling) And one for me. We're going to give you a five minute head start. Unless, you'd rather go to the Mato Grasso with me. It'd be just like old times, John, you and I. Think about it. The choice is yours. - Byron, there aren't any choices. We're not going to the Mato Grosso. And I certainly am not gonna give you the satisfaction of pretending you're still a hunter. (suspenseful music) No more games, Byron. (wolf growling and snarling) - Still think I'm playing games, John? Pick up the rifle. You've got five minutes. (tense music) (wolf growling and snarling) (rifle firing) (wolf yelping) It's hand to hand now, John. (suspenseful music) (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (both struggling) You lose, John. (gun cocking) Why didn't you use that before? - I doubt that even you would have stopped me if you'd seen a pistol in my hand. - You wanted me to stalk you. - Let's just say I didn't want you to leave. - But I am leaving, John. You won your life, cheaply and dishonorably, of course. But then every man places his own personal value on his existence. - Stay where you are, Byron. - You're breaking the rules, John. - Am I? Or did you just forget the more important rule of all. Remember? The prey will always do the unexpected. Byron... - You're civilized, John. Humane. You wouldn't shoot a man in the back. - I can't let you go, Byron. (tense music) Byron! (gun firing) (Byron yelling) (gun firing) (dramatic music)
