I am here... at the door. Are you OK? What's wrong? See? Still like a worm. Nervous? Is that because you write erotic novels? Oh, so you feel nothing "erotic" in real? What kind of stories do you write? Those fucking dirty ones. Well... Let me tell you one. I was a military instructor in a boys' high school. Watching those young boys playing basketball was my favorite thing to do. Every time, when I saw those sweaty young bodies, it always made me fucking hard. One day afternoon, I went to the sports equipment room. I found our school basketball team captain sneakily jerking off inside. I suddenly shouted. He was too shocked to put his clothes on. That fat dick was just sticking right out of his pants. What a fucking treasure. Then, I commanded him to strip off all his clothes, and did sit-ups towards me. I pulled out my fucking hard dick, and made him suck it every time he sat up. Just like that. One, two... And I remember, I gave my blue jacket to that boy. He covered his head with my jacket and started crying. That was my first time lending people my things. Since then, that boy's smell has been lingering on the jacket till now. Why don't you stay with them? Then who'd stay with you? I'm... fine. So am I. I prefer staying with you. I feel like coming. Help me. SODOM'S CAT Are you still a student? Good. It's nice to be young. Your watch. And I'll keep your phone for now. Have you got fat recently? Have l? I went to the gym just yesterday! Are you guys together? Are we? - They are fuck buddies. - Shut up, you asshole. Don't listen to his rubbish. What about you? Did you guys know each other before? And you're both single? You two make a nice couple. I'm going for lunch now. You guys wanna come together? I think I'd just leave, thanks. - I'll go with him. I have to go back to work. - Ok. And you? Uhm... We will go with you. I... Are you in a hurry? Have you been using it for a long time? What? Oh, you mean "The Taipei Orgy Club." Only for a couple of months. Many times? Not much actually. Though there are lots of guys in the club. Not many of them dare to show up. You guys know how to get back? Yes. Well, I've got to go. - Bye. - Bye. Are you still a student? Yes. I just graduated. Waiting to be enlisted for mandatory military service. Where do you live? Near... near the train station. Really? So you know there's a restaurant with great fried rice, right? Next to... the juice stand? Right! How did you know that? - Do you remember that... - I remember every time I was there, I'd always get a delicious green bean milkshake at that stand nearby. But that's only available in summers. So after I finished the intensive course nearby, I never went back again. Um... There's my motorbike. Got to go. - Will you... - Huh? - Will you come again? - Where? Oh, you mean "That". Probably not... One special experience is enough. Bye. Have you eaten? Yes, I have. How's the interview? Is everything okay? Maybe. I don't know. Get yourself together. It's been so long after you demobilized from the military. Be more active, okay? Duke quits the group, I have no choice for him. Are you coming to Beijing for six nights? What are you doing? Just checking hotels in Okinawa for our trip. It's done. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Will you go to the hospital with me tomorrow? Me? I thought mom is going with you. You live nearby? Me too. I can't sleep. So I'm out walking around. It's separating. These two things won't be together forever. They take sides in the end. Goodbye.
