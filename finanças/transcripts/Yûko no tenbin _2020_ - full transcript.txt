Ogi. Ogi! Train time? 4:42pm. The station? 7 minutes away. Go get the car. Yuko won't give up. Just go get it. Written, Directed, & Edited by Yujiro Harumoto. A BALANCE How many times have you come here? I've... lost count. When you practice here, what do you feel, and think about? Well... The view. The coldness of the air. The things Hiromi saw, and felt. What do you think this place meant to Hiromi? One last question. If you could go back and say something to Hiromi, what would it be? Okay. That'll be all. - Are you sure? - Yes. Thank you for persevering. I'm sorry. Ms. Kinoshita... She messed up the same part. She kept playing it over and over. I got mad and told her to practice outside. "Mess up all you want." "Practice at home all you want." That's what I'd say. Mr. Hasebe... Would you mind us using that too? Ogi, get there in 5. Tomiyama, we'll make it. You distracted me. You gave me no choice. Your watch is 2 minutes fast. Yuko's watch is never wrong. Got the footage. Yuko wins? - Yeah. Your treat, Mr. Tomiyama? - Why should I?! Tommy! Tommy! Shut up. Alright! Alright, alright! "Hiromi's father Hitoshi Hasebe (45)" I went to her school because she was bullied. "Hiromi has been dating her teacher Mr. Yano, and engaging in lewd behavior on school grounds." Or so I was told. That there were witnesses. Hiromi and Mr. Yano said... Of course, they'd denied it. But I was told there was proof. "We recommend she leave school." "She won't be able to progress." They were smirking. I'll never forget it. "That night, Hiromi plunge into a river, and ended her own life." The school's press con goes here. Bullying was denied. Witnesses and photos confirmed the relationship, and Hiromi was expelled from school. They denied responsibility for her suicide. "The next day, the school's response was criticized, "and media coverage increased. "Unfounded articles appeared about the school, Mr. Yano, his family, "and even the late Hiromi... "resulting in another victim. "Mr. Yano committed suicide, leaving a note. "This is what he wrote. "I am not in a relationship with Hiromi Hasebe. "The school and media have arbitrarily spread false information. My death is my protest." The media killed him. I lost my chance... to learn the truth. They took it. Pause for a moment. This wasn't in the script. No. The victim's families were hurt most by the actions of the school and the media, in my view. That's not what you wrote. Why change it? To omit lies. Mr. Hotoda's problem is with the choice of wording, correct? Yes. And the structure. Media criticizing media. You're creating enemies. News division will object. No positives, only negatives. Right, Tomiyama? I think we need to self-correct... Admitting mistakes is admirable. Excuse me. Play the pre-title. The media killed him. I lost my chance... to learn the truth. They took it "The media killed him." "They took it." Cut them. He said "the school" somewhere. Put it before "They took it." "I lost my chance to learn the truth. The school, they took it." Okay? Fine. Here. Cut all of this. Restructure it. Hello? Yes, yes. Monday? No problem. Yeah. Oh, from here? See? Yuko. That's how it is. So, having a kid made you lose your balls? No pay if you quit. Hey there. 20 donuts. - Hey, mister. - Oh, Yuko. - Fried rice and gyoza. Large. - Got it. "Kinoshita Cram School New students welcome." Miss Yuko! I'm your pinch hitter. Really?! I brought snacks! One each! Yuko. Blame whoever fell off the train platform. A pro prepares herself for anything. A pro could teach on his own. Hey you guys. Get over 80 points, or no donuts for you. Go! No complaining! Do your best! If it's too hard for Nana, just make up something easier. Got it. Daichi! Kenta! Come here. Daichi. A sophomore. - Basketball captain. - You knew? - Can I? - Sure. Anyone new? Mei. Same school as Daichi. This is trig functions. - Okay. - Thanks. Come on! Let's study! Sit down already. Private lessons too! Starting now! Go in. Wow. Mei? I'm Yuko. Howdy. Let's go. Let's go! Sit down! This is too hard! Just try it. Everybody sit. Got your assignments? Okay. Meditate! Now go! Why not "New school year"? I think I won't recruit. The lease renewal? I'll find the money. If student fees can't cover it, it's time to quit. You mean that? The local kids need this cram school. So do we. "Shoot place where teacher died" Next, I'll interview Yano's mother. She'll be the focus. The family of the "victimizer." Yano's. Hasebe's. The school. Each perspective. Staying impartial. Differences will come to light, exposing underlying issues. The network wants a routine piece on bullying. Liar. Then why use a nuisance like me? No time for this. I'll make time. Think I'll fall for that again? I can always go with plan B. I'm coming in with the crew now. Alright. She's behind the screen. I'll introduce her. This is Toshiko Yano. Hello. I'm Toshiko Yano. Also, her daughter Shiho is with her for support. I'm Shiho Yano. Wait. I'm the director, Kinoshita. What's going on? Sorry? This screen. Yes, and? You can't tell who's behind it. Our duty is to protect the family. We can't risk exposing their identities. Mr. Mutsu, you didn't say so in your email. No, I did mention the screen. I presumed it would obscure her face, not her whole body. You should've said that. Mr. Mutsu. We should've been clear. I'm sorry. However, I think this situation won't help Toshiko at all. How can she open up to me without seeing my face? If she can't speak her mind, this will be a lost chance for her. Could we please shoot it with only her face obscured? Please let me talk with Toshiko eye to eye. I understand. Nevertheless, protecting Mrs. Yano is my priority. - Kinoshita! - I'm done here. If my face won't be shown... it's alright. You don't have to. He's right. Please decide for yourself what you want to do. After transferring to the school, he was always exhausted. Also, he even went to work on his days off. Club activities? Or work? Both. "It's an endless cycle." "Everyone pushes work on me." "I tried to tell the head teacher, but got ignored." and, "I want to quit this school." How did that make you feel? I felt relieved. It wasn't worth ruining his health. But, my husband was strongly against it. That job wasn't easy to come by. Kazuyuki said he'd quit? He told me on November 4th. When did you learn that the school suspected Kazuyuki was dating Hiromi? After Hiromi committed suicide. The day before the school's press conference. November 25th. The school called. "Has your son told you anything?" We had a family meeting. With my husband, Shiho, and Kazuyuki. The four of us talked. What about? If there really was a relationship, or immoral conduct, like the school said. What did Kazuyuki say? "There wasn't." "The school set me up." What did you think? What? "Think". Your impression. That he didn't do it. Kazuyuki often had shouting arguments with the school. "I'll expose your deceit," he'd say. I expected some kind of retaliation. Actually, on the day Kazuyuki said he'd resign, the head teacher questioned him about his relationship with Hiromi. Why do you think he didn't tell you? The school framed him. On the day of that serious development, he told you he'd resign. How do you think he felt? Defeated. I think they broke him. Do you think there was anything you could've done as a family? Stop. Are you alright? Let's break. Ogi, bring water. What if you broke her? She'll pull through. Can't extend our hotel stay. But it's getting interesting now. Don't push your luck. Tommy... Oh, Yuko. I need to ask you. Mrs. Yano can't do more today. Can we continue on another day? That's from Mrs. Yano? Yes. To be honest, I wasn't expecting this. She wants you to come to where she's living. Gladly. How about tomorrow? I'll ask. I'll pay for the extra night. And work the camera. Ogi, drop me here. - See you in Tokyo. - Where are you going?! "Die" "For sale" The old Yano home. The old Yano home. You a relative? You're press. Got permission? I'll call the police. Leave us alone! You've done enough harm already! I'm sick of this! Honey! Call the police! It's the press! "December 27th. "Mr. Yano was found by his sister beside a river near his home. "He died of hypothermia. "He had taken an excess of a sleeping drug. Police called it suicide. "A note was found next to his body. "It asserted his innocence, criticized the school and media... It asserted his innocence, and intensely criticized the school." I became a hairdresser in Tokyo, got married and had a daughter, then came back. I was just about to open a salon. Then those wild rumors spread. Everything fell apart. My salon, and people too. - Damn, you're all wet. - Shut up. The building on the right. 2nd floor, apartment 206. It's unlocked, so just go in. And absolutely do not shoot the exterior. Understood. Thank you for having me. I'm sorry about yesterday. Please, don't be. Thank you for coming. Thank you. I you don't mind, could you please keep your voice down? May I have a little more light? I want you to show me living like this. Thank you. What is this for? I pretend I'm not here. No matter how many times I've moved since then, someone finds my address, and puts it on the web. All this may seem silly to you, but without it, I'm too scared to go out. I hardly go out during the day though. I don't have many things. So I can move again at any time. When I wake up, first I check whether my address has been posted. Mine, and Shiho's. I spend about two hours searching. If I find nothing, my day can begin. "I have a daughter. And a grandchild. So I'm happy. Rely on no one!" Actually, I sleep lengthwise here. One can a day. It's the greatest indulgence I allow myself. Hello! Delivery for Mrs. Kato! Absurd, isn't it? It only took one news story... Please ask everyone else. Everyone else you shoot. Who is the real victimizer? Toshiko. I can't take anyone's side. But I can shine a light. Paper edit by tomorrow? Today. Go! All pencils down. Invalid test. Redo next week. - Cheating? - Who? Nana, Rio. Printouts. Why? I was on a roll. Sorry Kenta. Oh man... This sucks. Give me one. Choc chip's so good. Listen. I used to study here too back in the day. Dad caught me cheating. At our cram school, in front of everybody. Horrific, right? Math is hard? I hate it. I'll teach you how to like it. I'm too dumb. It'll work. Dumb old me guarantees it. Bath's ready. Oh, thanks. Hey. Remember when you caught me cheating? Yeah. You scolded me in class. Thanks for that. Mei cheated. Her dad raises her? Her mom died when she was little. I'm teaching. What? Your changes were approved. - For real? - For real. They love Toshiko's POV. Great. Shoot more? We need it, so yeah. Next is Kazuyuki's sister, Shiho. Thought so. Thought so. I'm asking Mutsu. When do we meet? Tomorrow pm? Fine. Sushi. No cheap stuff. It's a meeting, dammit Miss. - Where's Mei? - In there. She has heavy periods. Thanks. Go back. And this? There's a hanger on my desk. And a bag under the sink. Got it. Mei. It's Yuko. I'm coming in. You okay? Got medicine? Taken any? We'll go to hospital just in case. Her father? I left a message. Keys. - Sir, we're done. - I'll be right there. I'll let you know. Dad works till late? Yeah. You do all the housework? Not all, but most of it. You always eat alone? Yeah. I see... You hate being alone. Even if it's hard, you force yourself to go to school. Then you feel worse. If you end up collapsing, at least you don't have to think. Why do you know? I was the same. I sucked at drawing though. Your insurance card... Want me to come? What? What? What's wrong? I might be pregnant. Who's the father? Mr. Kinoshita. When? Two months ago. He forced you? I'm behind on my fees. He said he'd waive them. Home pregnancy tests? At the back. Top left. At the back. Top left. Where? The back top left of what? Use this. Do it one more time. "Year 2 Group 3 Mei Obata." Miss... Help me. Please... Help me. Nobody can know. Not the school, or my friends. My dad most of all. Oh. Hello. Good to meet you. I'm Yuko Kinoshita from Kinoshita Cram School. Tetsuya Obata. Sorry for any trouble my daughter's caused. I heard your message. She shouldn't make a big deal out of her period. You took her to hospital? I didn't. Oh, okay. Sleep it off. You made it up to get out of school? Huh? She's such a liar. Screw you. Hey. What's your problem? We're talking about you. About you. - Mr. Obata. Mr. Obata... - You hear me? Mei really is feeling quite unwell. You must be busy. I can give you a ride. I drove here. Oh, right. Okay... Mr. Obata. Well... About Mei. Please go easy on her. Let her rest for a few days. She has heavy periods, so... That's beyond me. It does that to her? At worst, she could collapse or vomit. Miss Kinoshita... I'm behind on my health insurance payments... If Mei gets worse, what should I do? Contact me anytime. I know a good doctor. Thank you. I appreciate it. I mean it. Contact me anytime. I will. Thank you. Oh, Yuko. You made it back. How's Mei? Phone problems? I called several times. Got something to say? Go ahead. Oh... Thanks. Try again. Well? Look. Closely. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. For what? For having relations with a student. I'm sorry. Why? - I'm sorry. - Why'd you do it? Because, I was weak. Quit being so abstract. Explain in concrete terms. You came on to her? No. She came on to you? No. It just happened? Neither of us initiated it. Her fees. You said you'd waive them. I said that later. Not before. She's behind... - We talked, then she cried... - Enough. When? Two months ago. Where? Here. Just once? Don't you get it? A 17-year-old high schooler knocked up by a teacher 40 years older. Everything's ruined. What about the school? Our students? Mei wants it kept secret. Let me... think it over tonight. Defeated. I think they broke him. Do you think there was anything you could've done as a family? Yo. Sorry to bother you, doctor. How can I help you, director? It's a new project, so keep this off-record. Sure. What it's about? Child abuse. Sexual abuse in particular. A girl carrying her father's baby. She wants to abort it right away. Does her father know about it? He doesn't. Only I do. Her father's her only family. She's afraid he'll beat her more if he finds out about it. Police? Word would get out she was raped by her father, so she doesn't want the police involved. Remember that drug you told me about? The one illegal Asian immigrants use to abort pregnancies. You said it's easy to get. No surgery. It violates the Maternal Protection Law. It's criminal. Of course, but it would solve her problem. Forge consent and see an OB-GYN. Secrecy is crucial. That's why I'm asking. Is it truly her best option? It doesn't solve everything. What's moral isn't always what's best. I think this option will be the least painful. You know, this is all topsy-turvy. I'm saying things you should be saying. Wait... I can get the drug, but... it'll be quite risky. I'd never rat you out. Where should we do it? I'll need to keep an eye on her condition, and I'll need to prepare. I'll be in touch. You profiled that novelist Shuichi Murakami. I'm a big fan. An autograph'll do. "To Mr. Kobayashi." I'll be waiting. Hi. Hey! You guys! Where's your focus? Carry on with self-study. Sorry. Whoa, this is foul! It's gone stale! - Mouldy! - Whose is it? Knock it off. Don't be dicks. What's going on? They act up with no teacher. Lighten up. You need to warn them. Come on, sit. All of you, sit down. Sit. Want to fool around? Leave. Here. Thanks. Just eat what you can. It's hot. Yum. Really? May I join you? "Join me"? Mind if I eat too? Dad doesn't say that? I don't know. We don't talk. Is the gas still on? Yeah. By the way, I couldn't find your chopsticks. They all look like your dad's. That's because... Never mind. There's a cute spoon and fork though. What? How come? So what? Why? I'm curious. I drop food with chopsticks. I drop food. Hey. You're trolling me. You're mean. - I'm not. - Yes you are. I am not. I use chopsticks when I go out. I know. Part-time job? Yeah. But my school bans them, so I had to quit. Miss... What? Can I go back to the way I was? You'll be fine. Don't you worry. I want to go to college. You're good at drawing. Art school? No way. That's why Dad's how he is. Anything'll do. I just want a regular job and regular pay. "Long live Mr. Kinoshita" So anyway. I talked to a doctor. He says he'll help, but I'm not sure yet. It's way more punchy now. A really raw POV. I want to hear from Shiho too. Hello? Mr. Hasebe, sorry it's so late. Kinoshita here. Apologies for playing phone tag. I've been busy. Sure. How can I help? As well as your family, I want to learn more about Mr. Yano's. I'll reveal what they couldn't say, and how they live, contrasting your claims with the school's. Well, that's... I'd like to believe you, but... My words have been misrepresented before. I'm sorry. Nobody buys, but I keep baking. Every single day. Know why? If I quit, they win. Omitting Mrs. Yano would be the same as the social indifference you've suffered. I pretend I'm not here. No matter how many times I've moved since then, someone finds my address, and puts it on the web. I don't have many things. So I can move again at any time. Absurd, isn't it? It only took one news story... You and Mrs. Yano share the same predicament. I'm going to see her. I'll visit later to update you. Ms. Kinoshita. Mr. Yano... was fond of these. He stopped by. On his way to school. Sorry I didn't say. I'll deliver them. Thank you. I think she's not comfortable with her child appearing on screen. But photos alone aren't enough. She was very much against me appearing, at first. She only took part before reluctantly, in the spur of the moment. Shiho is... desperate to protect her daughter Arisa. I know all too well. I'm sorry. A gift. Not from me. Kazuyuki liked them. He often visited Mr. Hasebe's bakery. Don't worry. I only told him I was going to visit you. May I have one? It's good. I'll make tea. Would you like some? I would. Excuse me. Miss Kinoshita's father? Who might you be? Mei Obata's father. Thanks for teaching her. Oh... I'm director Kinoshita. It seems Miss Kinoshita's been cooking for Mei, and even paid our gas bill. Thank you. Oh, no need. No, please take it. It's not for that. When I got home, she was studying. Rain's more regular. Sorry for coming so late. I'll go now. I need you to let me apologize. I'm truly sorry. What I did was inexcusably senseless. And thoughtless. And irrevocable. I've let you down more than ever before. I can't regret it enough. I know I'm asking too much... but as your father, I want to start over. To do that, need to do the right thing. I'll talk with Mei's father. What if you can't settle? What if he tells the police? As it stands now, only I'll be charged. You don't get it. That's just the law. Society isn't so forgiving. It won't be only you who suffers. Mei will too. And our students. And me. And my crew. We'll all suffer. Just for one lousy bit of sex. B-But... You'd have to lie for me for the rest of your life... I know what I'm doing. I've got too much to lose. Dad... You just want to free yourself. That's not true. Then shoulder the burden. With me. So that's it! Thank you. Sir? Will the school close down? What? You stopped recruiting. My sister wants to enroll. You'll quit? We're short-staffed. We'll do what we can. Do this. Off you go. Problematic records are said to be "discarded and unavailable." When they're discovered, it's "I cannot recall." The ruling party obscures the truth! Correct information must be released and debated. Constitutional democracy is being subverted! Japanese democracy is an endangered species! Mr. Kinoshita? I thought so. Shopping? Oh. Yes. So much for rain, huh? Is Mei paying her fees? She promised to pay herself. Don't worry. I'm being paid. Oh yeah? Good. She's dumb like me, but please treat her well. I will. Hey, let me know if you need contact lenses. Cut price. Oh. Sure. What the fuck? Are you crazy? You made me drop 'em. Pick 'em up. Quick. Those too. Not even once? It's never slow. It never lies. Want it? Really? Isn't it precious? Promise me then. What? My mom promised she'd buy it for me, if I got full marks in a test. Huh? I could never do that. So you decide. Think and decide for yourself. Forget it. Too hard. What? You've done it. You studied? Schools for studying art. Go for it. Hey, cut it out. Midnight snack. Fried rice. Tea. Miss Yuko'll take me to hospital. You don't have to go to school. Okay, we're done. You can wash off the jelly now. It's over? For today. You can take her. Watch your step. Your feet. That's it. Let me know. The blindfold too. How is she? Not good. Could be an ectopic pregnancy. Which means... She might need surgery. At a hospital to handle a transfusion, or an emergency. If she suddenly started bleeding heavily, it could endanger her life. No. Isn't there another way? Not for her, unfortunately. Miss? For her own safety, she needs treatment as soon as possible. Sorry, I got a call. I was a little worried. Watch your step. Where's the doctor? Gone for a smoke. What'd he say? He'll check your data and let us know. But it looks okay. Oh. 70 points. In that test. No good? It's good. Yeah? Hey, when's the on-air date? - Your doc? - Yeah. Um... Two weeks from now. Got it, thanks. While I've got you, good news. What? Just heard from Mutsu. Shiho agreed to take part Toshiko talked her into it. It's looking good. Damn, you don't sound happy. Sorry. Email me. That crooked mouth. Faces reflect souls. Look at those saggy eyebags. His froggy mug screams corruption. "Froggy mug"? So where do we add this? Anywhere'll do. Right, Yuko? Yuko? Where's good? That was a death stare. This whole country's apathetic. What kind of work do you do now? In the next prefecture, cleaning in the day, and part-time goods sorting at night. What do you make in a month? Two jobs, 15 hours a day, five days a week, I make just over 200,000 yen. Why give up being a hairdresser for that? Peace of mind. Lots of staff turnover. People keep to themselves. I can quit anytime. Have you ever been recognized. Before my divorce, it got out at my part-time job that I used to be a Yano. I had to move three times. You'll see my mom tomorrow? Yes. We'll mainly shoot her place, and other scenery. Thank you for today. Oh, sure. - Tommy, can you do it? - Why? There's a shot I need. She's lying. Faces reflect souls, huh? "A family of foxes is collecting nuts." 1, 2, 3. Minus 14 is? Five. Five nuts. - I did it. - You did. "There's an apartment building with 13 floors. Yoma's apartment is 10 floors down from the top." You okay? What's "stock"? What's "stock"? I was told, "I know what stock you come from." When? I'm not sure. About a month ago, I think. By who? A boy in my class. You told your mom? I didn't. I'm home. Foxes! - Hello. - Hi Mom. Here's yours, Arisa. - Dig in. - Thank you. Bless this food. - Yummy. - Yummy? It's yummy! - Egg paradise. - Egg paradise? 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Wrong order! I've got none! I've got none. That's not fair! Take this. Why?! Show us. No way, no way! No interview this time? Arisa... gets comments from classmates. I thought so. Something seemed odd. She didn't want to worry you. Thank you. I'm alright. I got mad and told her to practice outside. "Mess up all you want" "Practice at home all you want." That's what I'd say. Tomiyama. They want a new project from us. Also, they hired me full-time. Way to go. Thanks. - Don't cause a scandal. - You too. Wanna grab a bite? A toast. You go ahead. - The usual place. - Sure. I'll be a dad next month. Huh? That's what you should be celebrating! - When? - Next month. What about Mei? She'll wait for her test results. Let's go. To see her father. I can't. Not till my piece airs. I can't let what I'm working on get pulled from broadcast. When will it air? In two weeks. Can Mei wait that long? Her life's at stake. So are the lives of the people I interviewed. But... Even if it gets pulled, nobody will die. Somebody already has. I'm trying to resurrect them. If Mei... gets worse, what do we do? We make her our priority. So close. No deal. Right? It's good enough. Impressive, right? Right? Right. First time in my life. A consolation prize. Try them on? I'll make tea. Oh, hi Miss. I just dropped by. What's this? Hands off. What's this? Tickets. For the movies. For two. Really? Hey, have you had dinner? No, but I'll go now. Why? Stay. Yeah. Try some of this. I got given it. I'll make soup then. - Soup? You? - Better than yours, dude. "Dude"? How dare you! - Where's the pot? - You used it last. - Oh, I did. - See? "Morning." Why'd you run? You dating Mei. Huh? What the hell? - You were at her place... - I wasn't. I'll ask Kenta. He'll talk. No, dammit... It's the truth. We did it once, then she stalked me. Then why go there? I sent her a DM saying "Die." Now she skips school. I'm not the only guy. She does it for cash. Miss, don't believe her. She's always lying. 'Morning. Weird? What? What's on your mind? Nothing. Yeah? Busy? Got a minute? What? Shiho came. She really wants to talk to you. At the office? Yeah. She's talking crazy. Wants us to cut her part. Anyway, can you come? She wants you. Shiho? Conference room. Angry? Doesn't seem so. Scared about the broadcast? Talk her around. The producers? As if I'd tell them. Hello. Sorry to bother you at such a busy time. You came so far. I would've gone to see you. Please. How's Arisa? For now, she's taking a break from school. My mother's taking care of her. It seems Arisa really enjoyed her time with you. She kept asking when you'll come back. I see. If I was able to be her link to the outside world, I'm glad. I hope I was for you too. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. What for? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm being punished. Don't make a sound! Okay. Stop it, Mr. Yano! Hiromi. I'm the only one who can save you. Don't do this! Keep it down, please! But the note they found... I wrote it. I... stole his chance to atone. I was scared. I couldn't bear to be attacked any more. Put it away. Kinoshita? Can we talk? Maybe we can cut Toshiko and Shiho. It's nothing to rejoice over, but Hotoda says we have to re-edit it. He showed it to management. Word from the top. Why? It doesn't suit the show. They want it made simple. Good Mr. Hasebe vs. bad school faculty. "Faculty"? Kazuyuki Yano too. It's not like that. Then make it like that. How's she? I'll explain when you're done. We can't go to air. Due to a major misunderstanding. Isn't that right? Misunderstanding? About what? Many reputations are at risk, so I can't say. But I guarantee it. I need to know. I know, on behalf of us. I can't accept that. No need to. It's a misunderstanding. We're in too deep for this. In too deep? You want me to twist the truth. Hey. Say what you told me. One more time. Go ahead. Dammit... Whose side are you on? "Whose side"? What's a "side"? I'm... still a documentary director. If it goes to air, we'll be the same as the media who hounded Kazuyuki. Scum who spread lies as truth. Stop being so naive already. Whatever we put together is the truth. Hello? Oh, right. Yes, I explained by phone. Let's go, Shiho. Mr. Hotoda, now's not a... W-Wait a moment. Hey! Kinoshita! Kinoshita! Kinoshita! I'll let you do it your way next time. Think I'll fall for that again? Sorry. We won't make it. We can try again. Have dinner at my place. We got to teach. Come over after. Don't worry about me. Actually, Dad gave me money. So we can eat together. You can't? Okay. Great. Anything you can't eat? Drop me at the station. Your baby's father... Who is it really? Huh? The doctor said you need a proper checkup immediately. Might be an ectopic pregnancy. No way. It's important. Tell me the truth. What does that mean? Not hiding anything? I'm not. Look at me. You're not? I'm not. Daichi. He told me a rumor. About you. Great. You're just the same. Mei... Wait, please... That hurts! Mei! Let's go. Hello? Miss Kinoshita! How is Mei? They operated. She's in there. Is she conscious? What happened? She fell from the sidewalk. A passing car... She fell? The driver said she stumbled into the road. Somebody who saw her... said she looked really sick. Miss... Mei was pregnant. I just found out. Did she say anything? Mr. Obata? Go back. You shouldn't be here. If you need... money, please let me know. I think she... was selling herself. But I couldn't ask her! I'm sorry... Don't be. Miss, please go in and see her. But I'll... get in the way. You won't. Please. See her. Mei. Miss Kinoshita's here. Mr. Obata? Sorry about that. She spoke to me yesterday. "When I get 80 points, it's mine. When she does, I'll buy it. I'll drive you. There's a bus. I'll drive you. Please focus on Mei. It was my father... who got her pregnant. I tried to cover it up. Hey... It's not going to air. Just so you know. Bye.
