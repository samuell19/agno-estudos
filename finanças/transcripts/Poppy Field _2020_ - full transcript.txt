POPPY FIELD Big boy! Really? How are you? Good. Nice. Thanks for letting us park here. My pleasure. Make sure to leave me your phone number, just in case... No, my brother isn't home this week, the spot was empty anyway. - Yeah? - Yeah. No, really, at least let me give you my number. And then give me a ring. Hadi? Yeah. It's even. OK? It's a joke. I'm kidding. OK. I was thinking we could go somewhere together. Take the car, stay someplace overnight... English, please. I thought we could take the car, go somewhere, stay the night and come back the next day. Go where? I don't know... the mountains. What do you think? I don't know what to say. I don't think I can. I was just thinking that it would be nice to go somewhere, just the two of us. I know, you told me that before. And? It's complicated. Come on, and it's crowded, you know, it's weekend, and the roads are crowded, we don't have highways. You don't have to justify yourself, it's not worth it. What? - You don't have to explain yourself. - No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. Come on, don't get upset. - I'm not, you are explaining yourself. - No, you are. No, really, I'm not upset. OK. You don't have to justify yourself. I can take the car and go around the city while you're at work. OK? I can keep busy. Do you want something from the kitchen? No, nothing. I hope I didn't make too much noise. No, it's OK. Nooo. Please, please! - It's good. - Very good? - Very good. - Thank you! You know... Did you put onion inside? Yeah, so I think you will not kiss me anymore. Why? I didn't take my toothbrush. No problem. You can take mine. Really? Oh my God. - The smell? - Yeah. - It's like... - It's your fault. - Want some? - No. So, bon appétit. Bon appétit. Come on, just eat, please. Oh my God... You're spoiled. What does it mean? It means... It's something OK. Am I something OK? Yes, you are. You know, when I was little... Wait. Were you ever little? Yes. My God... Well, when I was a kid... Me and my sister would go every time at my grandmother and she would tell us stories about a lot of stuff and one of the stories it was about her and how she went to prison. Did I tell you that my grandmother went to prison? - Did she really? - Yes. - I think I told you that. - Maybe, I don't know. - You don't remember? - OK, maybe I forgot. - Fuck you. - You fuck you. OK. Yeah... Oh my God. And she made the best loaf cake ever. It was so good. And she had this thing, you know... She... When the cake got older and hard, you know, she put it in a cup and on top of it she poured milk and then three spoons of sugar. Oh my God, it was so sweet. It was very, very sweet. It was like diabetes in a cup. Tell me more about your grandmother and the story of the prison. Well, you know, it was in the sixties or seventies and it was the communist regime. My mother, she was a child and they lived in a town where everybody knew each other. And she was a school teacher. I know I told you that she was a school teacher. What are you doing here? I told you not to come. Oh, come on. Give me a kiss. Was that so hard? I brought you the food from Mum, I don't have any room for it in my fridge. Wouldn't hurt to call her now and again. - Hello! - Hi! - Hadi. - Cătălina. Nice to meet you. - Me too. - Cristi told me about you. Yeah. I guess this is the part where I have to say in a good way. Yes. Sorry for coming like this, but I have something for Cristi from our mother. - I'm sure it's something good. - Oh, yes. How do you say “homemade food” in English? I don't know. Whatever... There's cabbage rolls, cake, beef salad. “Homemade food”, you loser. It's more pork, you don't eat pork, isn't it? Oh for God's sake... - How was I supposed to know? - It's OK. - Well, take some. - Thank you. Our mother makes this for us since we are kids. Bismillah. Sorry? It means “in the name of God”. You have to say that when someone give you a gift or you begin a lunch. Anyway... Kind of like saying grace. Well, Bismillah then. Have another. Leave it there. Good, no? - Yeah, it's very good. - They're my favourites. It's the first sweet... I learned to do. Oh... I cannot cook desserts. Why? They are so complicated to make. - Well, I'm not an expert. - Come on. - No, I'm not! - I'm sure you are. I swear I'm not! But these are very easy to do. So, what do you do? Not much. I just arrived a few hours ago. Yes, Cristi told me that you will come today. But how long do you stay? Tuesday evening I have a flight to Hamburg. Nice. No? And how is it to travel so much, Hadi? I'm scared to fly, so... Well... I don't know, like any other job, no? I mean, if you enjoy what you do, it's nice. Yes, of course. Yes. Do you have plans for these days? I don't know... You know better. [in Romanian] I don't know, I leave for work in one hour. Say it in English. He has to go to work in one hour. Normally, no? What else? Yes. Why are you so boring? Why don't you do something nice these days? Take him somewhere nice. Take him to the mountains. Take him to the castles, Bran, Peleș. Oh, come on, Cătălina. Cristi! And how is Paris these days? Not good, no? I'm barely there these days, so... Yeah, I suppose life goes on everywhere, no? Yes. You have already been here? Yes. Yes? [in Romanian] How do you say... Four? [in Romanian] Four times? Nice. I suppose you learned alone, not from my boring brother. OK, I'll leave you two. Wait, you sure you don't wanna stay? No, no, she has to leave. Cristi, please. I swear this is not OK. Why are you acting like this? He likes to be the boss. It's your sister visiting us. What's your problem? Come on. Nice to meet you. Yeah, me too. Hope to see you again soon. Have a nice trip. Bye. Bye. - So what was this about? - What? This whole thing, your visit, your attitude... - What attitude? - Oh, come on... I was nice, he was nice, you're the one with a problem. - I have a problem? - Yes, I was just curious. I wanted to see for myself this phase you're going through. - What phase? - Your gay phase. After I get home tonight I don't plan on getting out of bed until Monday. I heard the weather's meant to turn bad anyway. Yeah, but you're so old. Oh, I forgot, I can't tomorrow. I'm going to the mountains first thing in the morning. With whom? My girl, her brother and his girl. Can't wait to have some mulled wine when we get there. Are the slopes already open? Yeah, man, it's been snowing for two days, that'll do. How about the roads in those parts? Are they snowed in? Who cares? I'll clear the snow with my bare hands if I have to. Yeah, well we might just have to do that, the weather's meant to turn bad. Yo, Gym-boy, I think Cristi wants to ask you nicely to take him along. If you behave, maybe I will. He could also take that Mirabela girl... Or whatever her name was. Anca. We don't talk anymore. We broke up. Really? Man, are you incapable of being with a girl? What's wrong with you, do you beat them or what? Why did you break up? Whatever, some bullshit. Why am I never home, why do I work so much, that I'm never there, that sort of stuff. Man, I hate that shit. I don't get it. Mine gets pissy about that stuff too, so I ask her: do you want food on the table, shoes on your feet? Stop talking nonsense, man, it's not the same. It's not like they were living together, he had only known her for... what, two months? Yep. So it's not the same with you and your girl. He's just a moron. Doesn't know how to act around a girl. Listen to me, you call her and tell her “Mirabela... how about coming to the mountains with me and my colleague, Alexandru?” She'll be on her knees, I bet. What am I, stupid? I don't beg. This one will die alone, man. He'll call us to go wipe his ass when he's old. No way, I'm not touching him. And if we have to, we'll just send Claudiu. Claudiu! Don't be such an idiot. - Hey, listen. - What? What do you want? Nothing. - Why are you making fun of him? - Well, well, look who's up. Look out the window, how lovely the city is, cars, manhole covers. Stop pushing into me, move over! - You're a fucking fat-ass, that's why. - Move the fuck over. You're a disgrace to the Gendarmerie. Boss, let's take him home, he doesn't fit in the van anymore. Shall I pull over here? Claudiu, your hand is on the gear stick, right? He's closer to the boss, you know. You, as a citizen, are required by law to show us some ID... - Only if I've committed an offence. - Is he under any suspicion? Nobody here is under any suspicion. This is just a procedure we have to follow. You interrupted a screening, people bought a ticket to be here. And you are? The projectionist. I'm going to ask you as well to show my colleague some ID. Of course. I've got nothing to hide. What do you think about this movie you're screening? What do you mean? Well, you're the projectionist and you don't know that this movie is filthy, it shouldn't even be screened. This is a movie with women mating with each other! Let's stay calm, we're not here to review movies. Shame! People bought tickets! People paid for this show. Exactly, for a cheap and dirty show! Easy, please keep your calm. The deputy manager will be here soon. Great, I'd also like to talk to him. You'd better ask those from the Gay Association for some ID as well! Yes, we will. Ma'am, the police will talk to everybody, so we can find out what happened here. Yes, we will. Lord, save your people and bless the heritage... Quite the commotion they made here. More or less. They made a fuss, yeah. A few said they're calling the press. And the NGOs just got here. Great. So here's what we should do: ID everyone who's already here and then let them go home. I don't think so. Let's just get it over with, they're already filming. Both the guys with the icons and the ones in skirts, if you get my drift. So let's just send everyone home and that's that. - Weren't you in the mood for a movie? - Oh yeah, I was dying for one. I'll go see what the boys are up to. You'll stay here, right? Where else? I'm going for a piss. Keep an eye on them. Be back in two minutes. Gays out of this country! Can you believe this? I asked for your full name. We've got nothing to hide! We want to know the legal framework. The quicker you show some ID, the faster we get out of there. You interrupted a screening, that's what you did. Why? Who gave you the right? So, what's the offence? How is it not an offence to stop people from watching a movie they paid to see? You know what? The police should find out who this organised group is. Man, what organised group? Please, stay calm. Look at him, a man your age to get involved with the likes of... Aren't you ashamed? You wretched man! That's why God punishes us! Lower your voice, please. I hope you realise that the police need to find out who interrupted the screening. You know that, right? So you have to show them your ID. But why should I give you my ID? I'm a free citizen of this country, I bought a ticket to see a movie. Are you with me so far? OK. You should ID these fine people who came to chant the national anthem. How about that? You are free to do whatever you want. Exactly. For example, to leave, since the authorities can't handle this situation. You can't leave right now. - Why not? - You have to show me some ID. Just show some ID and then you're free to go. Why? For what reason? - Will you show me your ID? - Why should I? Will you give me your ID or not? I'm not giving you my ID, just showing you. - Take your hands off me! - Please calm down! - I want to know why you're touching me! - Calm down! You are defending a bunch of filth! Filth! - Why filth? - Because that's what they are! Ma'am, please stop! - Why do you call it filth? - Please, show me your ID. The Romanian man put by God on this Earth is not a homosexual. The Romanian peasant would never... What? The Romanian peasant? Listen to me, please, for a second. I was raised in the countryside, OK? The Romanian peasant is much more complex than you could ever wrap your head around. I'm sorry. And he has the right to love whomever he wants. - Are you a sexo-marxist, miss? - A what? - Sexo-marxist! - Such big words! That's what you are! Ma'am, you're dreaming of orgies in factories. Maybe you should read that Bible you keep mentioning. It says you should love thy neighbour. [Romanian national anthem] Wake up, Romanian, from the sleep of death. Into which you have been sunk by the barbaric tyrants. Hi. How've you been? - Don't you remember me? - Beat it. What are you doing here? Bored already? It was too hot inside. Yeah, it is. - What's wrong? - Nothing, why? I don't know, you're making me nervous. - Want a cigarette? - No. Man, how crazy can you get... Who? These people inside. Oh... Lucky we have Oancea. She saves the day and gives us something nice to look at. - Yeah, she's hot. - Yeah, very. Sorry, can you spare a cigarette? Thanks. And a lighter? - Don't you know her? - No, how would I know her? Thanks. Let's go. Come on, I need a drink. Beer, wine, half a bottle of vodka, whatever. Chill. Let's stick around for a bit. What for? I don't know, see what happens. What's gonna happen? I might start punching people, that's what. I can't stand them, I swear. Chill. Really. Just wait another 15-20 minutes, and then we go wherever you want, drink whatever you want. What are you doing here? - Can't you see? - Come inside. Oh, for fuck's sake... They have to stop these homosexuals. Youths these days are all a bunch of leeches... I do mind my own business. This is my business. Why do you let them? Aren't they ashamed? Watch your language! You have no reason to yell. This is strictly police work. Did we break any laws? Did I say you broke the law? We're only asking people for ID. So you're not kidnapping us. Of course not. Please, just show us some ID. No, you're keeping us hostage. You're not letting us leave. - No one's taking you hostage. - Yes, you are. Just show me your ID. Did I do anything? Why can't I leave? Shame on you for watching that filth. Ma'am, enough with this nonsense. What filth, ma'am? Is it not obvious? You're ruining our children, shoving dirt down their throats. I have a small child at home, but when he's older I'll show him this movie. Are you not in your right mind? - God will punish you. - Why me? Because you're reckless parents raising reckless children. Watch your language! I didn't talk to you like that. Watch it. I didn't insult you. Please watch your language. Excuse me? I asked you to watch your language. Me? What about this lady? What is the gendarmerie here for? To defend us, honest citizens, or these people who committed an offence? Why would they defend you? Didn't you see your colleague grabbing that young lady? Yeah, this one! My colleague didn't harass anyone, he didn't grab anyone. The police will write a report... Come on, what report? Can't you see what these people are capable of? Sir, I was trying to be polite, OK? I've had it. You bunch of assholes! You should be ashamed to talk like that, considering your age. You're one of those strutting around the streets with feathers up your ass for all mankind to see. Shame on you! So what, did I come into your home or what? That would take the cake! Leave me be. Listen, lady. I hope you'll have a gay grandson. Then we'll talk. Gay? Can't you speak Romanian? You homosexual! Lucky you're straight! Ladies, enough! You've been yelling for an hour! How can a serious man like you associate with all these... - All these what? - All these faggots! Why use a word like that? It's the truth! Let the authorities to do their job! You're really gonna pretend you don't know me? What kind of education are you giving our children? This is a disease! Stop defending the homosexuals! Do we all have to have sex on the streets? Don't provoke us! Please come with me, I need to see your ID! You're just an employee here, stay out of it! This is a state cinema! It belongs to the state! The Romanian language! Romania! Not 'gays' and other crap. What the fuck do you want? Wow, hypocritical much? Not that I had any expectations from you, but this is too much. Piss off. Lame. Are you ashamed your colleagues might find out? Get the fuck out of here. So why are we here? I thought you wanted to talk. Talk about what? I don't know you, you followed me here. What? You beckoned me to get in here. What the fuck are you doing? Get the fuck out of my sight, you hear me? Listen, fancy a threesome? What? I was wondering if you and your lover wanted a threesome. What are you doing? You fuckin' faggot! Fuck you, you ass-fucker! Get off him! What the fuck are you doing? Hitting him in the face, are you crazy? Fuck him! I caught him jerking off in here. - What do you mean? - Are you an idiot? Stroia sent me to see what's in here and I caught him on the last row, dick in his hand. Who are you texting? Calling Mircea in here, you moron. That guy is going straight to the cops and everybody will see his fucked-up face. Go where? I scared him off, he's gone, I'm sure. Scared? With everybody outside, all those who can't wait to blame it all on the gendarmerie? OK, I'll go take a look. What are you doing? Cristi, stay put. I kept my eyes on you today as if you were my girlfriend. You left the unit like you didn't give a fuck. Cigarette breaks and whatnot. You idiot, I saw you coming in here. I thought to myself, look at Cristi, going to see dykes banging in a movie. I told you Stroia sent me here. So what? Are you trying to aggravate things with him? Acting all hysterical? Are you on your period? Fuck you. No, fuck you! You dickhead, always getting us in trouble! How could you hit him in the face? What are you doing here? Fucking? Talk some sense into this moron! He's a lost cause. I'll go outside, see what's up. You're bad news, listen to me. Shut up already! Fuck him. He's ratting us out to Stroia like he damn pleases, I'm sure. So what happened? I caught some guy jerking off in here, that's what happened. And I kicked him out of here. Fuck me. Did you hit him or what? Just a couple of slaps. I wanna go see what's going on. Hey, hey, Cristal, where are you going? Don't you start with me too, or I'll lose it! Start what? Cristal, don't you know me? Why do you wanna get out? Stay here, it's warm, take a break. It's worse if you get out. He'll recognize you and rat you out. I'd say that's worse. He has nothing to say. What could he say? I bet he's gone. Really? What makes you so sure? Like Alex said, the guy may very well still be outside, talking to Stroia and the cops, right? Did anyone else see you? Fucking nobody. Didn't you hear only Alex was here? Who else is here? What are you looking at me for? And this wanker... Who is he, what does he look like? The one from outside who asked you for a cigarette. Do you have any on you? I want one. I just wanted to let you know that the guy is talking to the cops. And Stroia knows, he asked me. He saw the guy with blood on his face. Yeah, I bet he asked you. - Sit down. - What did you tell him? Wait a second. What blood? Yeah, he kicked him in the face, fucked up his lip or nose, I didn't see up close. Come, let's see what the fuck's going on. - I'm coming too. - Stay here. Didn't you hear me? What? Have you all lost your minds? Hey, calm down. It's all good. Mircea, listen to me. I want to know what that guy is telling Stroia. I just wanna talk to him myself. You stay here. Isn't it enough that you embarrassed us today? Us and the whole institution. One gendarme equals the Gendarmerie. Shut the fuck up, are you three years old? - Cristal, you're risking your job. - Fuck my life, risk what? What am I risking? I don't know why you're acting like this. Really now. You have the caution from last year, Stroia's got his eyes on you all the time... Why the fuck are you acting like this? Understand that if you go outside, this whole thing blows out and everybody finds out. Finds out what? This thing that just happened. Cristal, you hit somebody. Mircea, listen to me, this one's a lost cause. I swear I won't hit him. I won't do anything. I just wanna talk to him. I swear. I know you wouldn't do anything to him, that's not the point. What the hell? Listen. We'll go first and see what's going on and then, I promise you, I'll personally talk to Stroia. I swear. OK? OK. So, just to be clear. From this moment on, you no longer exist. Yes. We don't know what happened. He was walking, fell down, broke his nose. We didn't see anything. Easy, right? No need to worry so much. Be right back. OK, so where did you say your seat was? I'm not sure. Around here somewhere. Have you seen a small, black waist bag? - A what? - A waist bag. Have you seen a waist bag? I haven't seen anything. I can't remember where I sat. Maybe you didn't leave it here. I had it on me and I only just realised it was missing. With all this commotion... I don't think I left it at home. And I had everything in it. I doubt it's here. Maybe you should look somewhere else. So what do I do now? I don't even have my ID. Go to the nearest police station. We looked everywhere, it's not here. Maybe I left it at home. Maybe. OK, thanks. Have a good evening. You too. - What the heck are you doing? - What does it look like? Are you out of your damn mind? I can't stand being in here. Oh, you can't? What about your colleagues who're trying to clean up your mess? I have shit to deal with, too, you know. Worries, problems, call them what you like. I swear. But... I keep it to myself. I don't lash out at work. Let me tell you something. When my father was in the Gendarmerie, in the nineties... One night they were all at the command post, some cards, booze, you know what it's like. And my dad goes to take a piss. One colleague follows him to the toilet... And tries to kiss him. In a flash. No idea how my dad managed to keep calm, but he did. And told his colleague 'I won't tell anyone, but if this happens again, I'll report it.' Give me a break. How's that guy? Is he badly injured? He had some blood on his face. Gym-boy was saying how the guy got all worked up, but the cop cut him short, saying no gendarme could've hit him, since they were all there and the theatre is closed now to the public. But that's all I know. So what does he want now? How should I know? And Mircea? What am I, the encyclopedia? Yellow Pages? How the fuck should I know everything? I had to watch those idiots so they don't poke each other's eyes out with those icons and whatever the hell they're holding. You think I've got no other problems? We're wasting time, instead of just taking care of things, sending all these idiots home, since they're all the same anyway, minding our own business, going for a hot meal... It's nice in here, I like it. It's a long time since I've been to the movies, never been here. Listen, Dan. Why did you come in here earlier with that guy? What do you mean? The guy looking for his bag. - He was looking for his bag. - Yeah, I know that. Did he need company, why did you come along? Did he personally ask you to escort him or what? Why didn't he come in alone? What do you mean? That's what I'm asking you. And I'm gonna answer too. You were at the door, making sure I won't go anywhere. What the fuck are we doing here? Is this what we've come to? Tell me why. Tell me why. What did that guy tell Stroia? What? Why won't you let me talk to him myself? Jesus... You've lost it completely. I've lost it? So why shouldn't I talk to him myself? He can tell me what his problem is. Be patient, let's see what happens, what the cops talk to him about... Why aren't they done yet? I'm sick of waiting in here. For fuck's sake! Mircea won't answer my texts, same with Alex. What the hell is there to talk about? His life story? How he came out of his mother's cunt, what? I'm going right now to talk to him. Jesus... Just go, leave me the fuck alone. Cristi! Don't do anything crazy. I must've sent you like three texts. Really? Didn't see them, bro. What's going on outside? We're getting worked up for nothing, there's nothing else to do. We'll wait and see what Stroia and Oancea say to the guy. What did Stroia say? I told him what we talked about. He didn't say anything. Is the guy okay? He's fine... He can stand, talk, fuck him. It's so stuffy in here, it's making me sleepy. I barely slept three hours last night. Mihaela cried all night long. Can you imagine what that's like? Why did she cry? She's upset with me, that's why. Why? About a week ago, maybe... After the match. Mihaela and I found a dog in front of our building. A Maltese, I think... Whatever. Black and curly, a Maltese. He had a rash on his skin, covered in that blue healing lotion, you know. And Mihaela was like, let's take him inside and feed him. OK, let's. You can't imagine how quickly that dog entered the building when we opened the door. In a flash. It went straight to our neighbour's door. We have this crazy old lady next door. And the dog started scratching at her door. So I go ask her if it was her dog. She opens and I'm like, 'Hello, is this your dog?' I hadn't seen her with a dog before, but I figured I should ask anyway. When she saw the dog, she went ballistic: 'Why did you bring it here, go away, I tried to get rid of it and you brought it back, take it away.' And slams the door in my face. We were shocked, both me and my girl. So Mihaela insists we take the dog in and feed it. I didn't want to, of course. With that skin... I also felt kind of sorry for it, but I didn't want any disease in my house. But in the heat of the moment, I said OK. We fed it and it went to sleep on the couch. And then Mihaela starts pleading. 'Let's keep the dog until tomorrow, take it to the vet...' I said OK. We took her... it was a female. She had a little tag that said 'Lola'. We took her to the vet... The doctor said she was very old, had no teeth left. And that the rash will go away and that other than that she's fine. And Mihaela was like, that's it, we have a dog now and we're keeping it. For a couple of days, I tried to convince her, you know. We couldn't keep a dog. I'm working all the time, she's working all the time. How the hell could we keep a dog? I finally convinced her. And after a couple of days we took Lola to the park and tied her to a tree. Mihaela packed for her a bundle with some food, with the special shampoo we bought for her rash... And a note saying: 'My name is Lola, I'm old and I'm looking for a home'. Something like that. And we left her there. And you can't imagine what I went through with Mihaela after that. She couldn't stop crying. With hiccups and all, all red in the face, I thought she was going to choke. Really, in the end it got so bad that we had to go back where we left Lola, who was no longer there, obviously. And yesterday was just the icing on the cake. What? Listen to this. I get a call on my landline. Get this. I had even forgotten I had a landline. A lady calls. Says she is a friend of Mrs. Lăcătuș, the crazy neighbour. I don't know how she got my number. Even I don't know it. Says she's a friend of Mrs. Lăcătuș, that she left her the dog to look after while she was abroad, and that Mrs. Lăcătuș told her she had lost the dog and we had found it. How could the crazy hag make this shit up? This lady asked us to give the dog back, because her nephew, who's in a wheelchair, is crying after it. That sucks. Man... Of course, Mihaela told her the whole truth, everything. You can't imagine what I had to go through the whole evening. Actually, the whole night. She complained that we abandoned the dog, that who knows what happened to it in this weather... What if a car ran over it? Yeah... She drove me up the wall. That sucks, what can I say. She'll get over it. Yeah, she will... But what if she doesn't? Come on... She'll get over it. How could you have known? About the dog and the lady... You couldn't have known. You wanted to do something good, right? Yeah... I mean, yeah. Listen. Lie low for a few days and she'll get over it. Yeah... I mean, yeah, sure. I might go outside, have a cigarette, maybe it will wake me up. Go. You think that guy will leave? Come on, screw him. He's probably already gone. - If anything happens, I'll text you. - OK. Mircică? Thanks, man. What are you doing? I wanna see what's going on. Why the fuck are you lying that I sent you here? Is that why you beat that guy up, because I sent you? Stroia! Don't Stroia me! How much longer do I have to cover for you? You asshole, how many times have I covered for you? Answer me, fuck-face, I can't hear you. I don't know. How come? Are you calling me a liar? Answer me. Where the fuck do you think you are? Doing whatever the fuck you want? Tell me. I have 50 people here and one of them tells me a gendarme of mine beat him up because he thinks he is not only smarter but also more of a badass than all of us? If I fucking tell you to stay here, then stay here! I wanted to see what was going on. You wanted to see what was going on? What the fuck could be going on? Now you see the gendarme, now you don't. If I've been trying for an hour to convince him that the gendarme who beat him up doesn't exist, why the fuck do you act like you do exist? Tell me! You know what? Why won't you let me talk to that guy? What did he say? I want to go out and talk to him. So he can tell it to my face. You dimwit. Are you retarded? Where do you wanna go? Stroia... I don't care what he told you. He's a liar. He's a faggot. He takes it up the ass, sucks cock and lies. He touched my dick. Did he tell you that? There's no talking to you. If you move, you're done. You stay here. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Claudiu. How long have we known each other? - Why would you do this to me? - Cristi, calm down. - How could I? - Just chill. Don't sweat it. What, because you smacked that guy in the face? Big deal. You know what? I'm glad you did it, fuck that faggot. Fucking pansies. Snowflakes. Always playing the victim. If you asked me, he deserved it. Do you know what he said about you? What? That you're this, that and the other... That you knows you personally. That you had some dates. That you like boys. Crap like that. He might as well have said that the whole gendarmerie sucks cock. A degenerate. And you go and make all this fuss for a little slap. You should've knocked him out, that fucking piece of shit. Now I'm angry. I swear, I don't get all the fuss. Let's just plant a bag of dope in his bag and arrest him for drug use and that's that. It happened to me once. Exactly like this, with one of his kind, in a toilet. I swear. I was in a club one Saturday night, drinking and that. I go take a piss... and while I'm pissing, I see this guy watching me. Looking right at my dick, you know? And I was like, yo! Just to scare him a little. Like, what the hell is this? He instantly freaked out, obviously. Whatever. But I respect that. Whoever you are, win or lose, might as well try your luck, right? Any man owes it to himself to try. But then don't ask why I smashed your face in. So I totally get you, man. I swear it. And anyway, I sniffed you out. But it stays between us, don't worry. You just wanted to kick his ass, didn't you? Why would he jerk off at a lesbian flick if he's a fag? You set him straight anyway, so fuck him. Mine doesn't have any dressing, I hope. Yes, princess. Are you worried you're going to spill some on you? Make a stain? Here. Take half. I don't want any, thanks. Yo, Gym-boy, eat slower, it's not good for you to eat that fast. Let me tell you what you could eat very fast. He's buying time. He's not in the mood for a trip in the hood. Where did you get those nice boots you were wearing today? Got them on Black Friday. You like them? Black Friday is a scam. Yeah, I never buy anything on Black Friday either. They're for hiking, right? Not streetwear. Boss, they're good for anything you want. They were massively reduced. From 350 to 100. Where from? Directly from the store. In St. George Square. Sportswear store. And is the sale still on? Boss, do you know what Black Friday is? Hello. What's up? I saw boots like that. At Miniprix. I'm OK. - Which Miniprix? - Otopeni. Did you get some sleep? Yeah, I'm not fucking going there. If you want to eat, we have in the fridge the things that my sister brought. Stuffed cabbage, yes. Well, I have to get back to work. I'll tell you when I get home. So, you need anything? OK. Yes, I can't wait. Yeah. OK, so... OK, bye. Something sweet would go down a treat now. I'll go buy something sweet then. Does anybody else want anything? I'm fine, thanks. Get some teddies. - Gummy bears? - Yeah. Actually no, get a chocolate croissant. What the fuck? A thrashing. Really now, don't ever do this again. I mean it. Whatever happens, come talk to me. Any problem you have, any trouble, any heartache, you talk to me. Don't go and do whatever you want, like today. You were lucky. The stars aligned for you. I mean it. He could've hit his head falling. Lucky we had the cop, Oancea, she's a good guy and understood the whole situation. That guy was lucky too. Had I been there, I would've knocked him out. I mean it. Just kidding, man. But for real now, anyone messes with you, you tell me. Got it? - Say yes. - Yeah. There you go. When you can, just pull over. - We're not there yet. - No, I just wanna walk for a bit. There, on the corner. OK, whatever you want. So, football tonight? I don't know, don't think so. OK, champ. Kisses.
