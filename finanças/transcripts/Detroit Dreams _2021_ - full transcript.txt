(siren wailing) (ambient music) (bright upbeat music) - Detroit, good morning. It's your boy, Nick Money, and I'm talking that cash on What's Real Radio. Listen, I got your chance to win these Kodak Black tickets, May 14th. Wake up, then call me. (313) 298-1075. Until then, man, I got some of that Lil Baby, (indistinct). - [Bobby] This is Detroit, the land of the haters, and have-nots, with the core fabric of a hustler, if you're built right. - Call and talk to me, (313) 298-1075. Don't forget I got some of that Lil Baby, (). And of course, Detroit's own, Marsh. Hey, shout out Bobby, man. Cooper Street Records, I see y'all, man. We are Detroit, man. What's Real Radio. - [Bobby] They say the only way to make it out of Detroit is with a big ass gun, and a bigger bag of dope. I didn't graduate from Cass Tech, or get a scholarship at Wayne State. But I always had the mind of a hustler, mind of a businessman. For some, it was drugs. But for me, it was parties like my father, then it came to music. I've been in this music game for five years managing every little upcoming group. (upbeat music) - Y'all better stop motherfucking playing with me in this bitch, before I pop the shit outta one of y'all ass. - What the fuck is y'all in here doing, man? - I'm working. This nigga always asleep. - Man, y'all supposed to be in here making music, man. - Man, these motherfuckers won't stop fucking with me. - [Bobby] People think being the manager is easy money, but it's far from the truth. You have to be their parent, their bookkeeper, even their supplier sometimes. Look at that drive here, that's the only thing I fuck with. (indistinct), you're gonna make a hit. - This is all I know. - What is you saying? Why you keep blowing my phone up? (indistinct) I'm your fucking manager, not your daddy.

I mean, your ass out the country every different week with a different nigga. I'm watching your fucking Instagram.

That's what y'all need to do. - Nigga, fuck you. (upbeat music) - Make it tenfold, nigga. - [Bobby] Now with more flyer, more cooler, and definitely more stubborn than Flight ass. One arm in the rap game, two legs in the streets. (indistinct chatter) (tense music) (door banging) - Get on the fucking ground. (indistinct chatter) - [Police] Put your hands behind your back.

It's all I can get. - Fucking back killing me. Doc won't give me shit else. - I would appreciate you handling this shit for me, Blake. - Let tell you something, Bobby, I'd rather have your money than your suck ups. Shit don't spend well at Mattel. But anyway, you do know even if I get these charges dismissed, he'll be violated by your PO. You do know that, right? - Yeah, I know. They ain't find shit on me though. - Shit. I seen your record. Three felonies, all drug related.

You guys want anything? - I'm good. - No? - I got another question for you though. - What's that? - Can you get that court date pushed back for me? I got a picture coming up, August 7th.

Detroit music ain't been shit since (indistinct) packed up and left this motherfucker 30 years ago. All right? You wanna go to the record industry? You gotta go where the record industry is. LA, Atlanta, New York. - This shit comes back around. You need to invest with me. - Invest? - Yeah. You need to invest in my label, Cooper Street Records. - Bobby, I called you down here to tell you your fucking retainer is over. That was my last- - But Blake- - No, no, no, no, no, Bobby. I help you out because I knew your father, but now you got me helping out your drug head friend. I'm sorry, young man. But lemme tell you something, if you ain't got no money, and this fool right here ain't got no money, you two motherfuckers gonna need a new lawyer. - Listen man, listen, man, listen. Just invest with me. You gimme 50 grand, in 12 months I give you your 50 and extra right on there. - Do I look like I got a Chase Bank written on my motherfucking forehead? Come on, man. It don't. Check please, Maggie. Bobby, listen to me. I need you to take a moment, and figure out what it is you want to do with your life. You wanna be a big music executive, break Detroit records? - Hell yeah. - Nice. But you ain't gonna do it on my motherfucking dime. I'm sure you'll come up with something clever. - Ain't shit to do in Detroit but to sell some dope. - Now you sound like a boss, boy. That's what the fuck I'm talking about. Boss up and get this money nigga. You fellas do me a favor, reach in your pocket and pay that motherfucking bill, all right?

I need you to throw a party in here, man, and tear this bitch up. You hear me, Bobby? - For sure. (indistinct) (upbeat music) - [Bobby] This is Detroit, home of the ghetto superstars. We never had a voice outside of what we created. (upbeat music) - Bitch, get the fuck out my way. Yo Bobby, man, what's up nigga.

Nina (indistinct) reporting live on the east side of Detroit. I'm currently at a restaurant where a shooting has just taken place. We have one woman dead and others have fled the scene. According to sources, I was told this was due to after a concert with Flight, the young rapper, here in the city of Detroit. According to sources, I was told- - Ay, yo, yo. What the fuck, man. You're in this bitch watching TV? Can I get my car up in this bitch for 45 minutes? - Man, fuck your car. - No nigga, fuck you. I'm outta here. - Man, it's just another tragedy in the black community. I came here to get something to eat. I seen the little young... - (indistinct) dawg. - -[Witness] It was a little altercation going on over here. - Damn. Dumb ass young niggas, man. All that damn dope. (indistinct), mollies and shit. - We don't need no more of this violence. It's real unfortunate. - Yes, it is very unfortunate here today. This is a horrible scene we have. I appreciate your help. Thank you today for telling us what you've seen. Again, this is Nina (indistinct) reporting live. (somber music) - Hand. That way, thank you. Next. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Hand. Hand. That way, thank you. - [Bobby] Man, I try to stay low from all the crazy rumors and all the shit going on on Instagram. But I had to stand up for Flight. I know he didn't do it. - What's up? It's your girl Sierra Jay, the sexiest voice in the city. In Detroit I got some piping hot tea for y'all. Word on the street is, Flight got into a little scuffle last night. Well, I wouldn't call it a scuffle y'all, because it was a downright shootout, and a young lady got killed. Now, you know how I feel about that y'all. I don't like that type of mess. So, I had to bring my boy Bobby in the building. So Bobby, why was Flight in that alleyway alone? - I don't know. - And where was his security at Bobby? And the most important question, why weren't you there? How did this happen? I'm not understanding how you're putting your artists in these type of situations to be alone. Now we got shootouts, people getting killed. Aren't you tired of it? So why would you put him in a position, leaving him out there alone? No security, like literally really, no security. This doesn't any type of sense. We got babies dying, we got young ladies dying. Next, it's gonna be your artist. Do you want him to pass away? You want situations like Proof? You want stuff like that going on? I know you're tired, 'cause I'm tired. - I couldn't speak. I got froze. - That's fucked up, Bobby. Real fucked up. - Wait, I ain't do that shit, man. - Bobby, if the press get a hold of this shit, they control the narrative. - Fuck, man. - Bobby, somebody shot this girl. And if it was a robbery gone bad, they don't have no robbers. They don't have no suspects, Bobby. I might even get a cop on man slaughter. Push this shit back, get the press off our ass. Five to 15. You can serve four on good time. How do you do it, Bobby? - To be honest, Blake, I don't know how to feel, man. - Bobby, what's really going on? - To be honest, man, I got myself into some shit I don't know I can't even get out of. - Such as? - What's up, y'all. It's your girl Sierra J, sexiest voice in the city. As we all heard, baby girl lost her life this weekend. We are going to be holding a special candlelight and balloon release for the family. Come with your donations, come with your prayers. Come whatever you can to make light of the situation y'all. We have got to stop the violence. So I need y'all to come together. Detroit, we gotta do it. - On my way right now. I got everything. Yes, let me call right back though. - Where are you going? - Bobby, I gotta get outta Detroit. I gotta go. - I told you I got this handled, Easter. - I killed a man. I fucking killed a man. - My God. Come on. Baby, I'm sorry. We did what we had to do. I told you I got rid of the body. - Bobby, please can you just come with me? Please just come with me back to Milwaukee. I packed everything, let's just go. We can start over. We can do it. - I can't go nowhere unless I can pick the city up and take it with me. I ain't leaving. - Typical ass Bobby. You don't never know when to fucking fold. - Hold on, old on, hold on. Don't leave. - Bobby, if you stayed in Detroit, your ass gonna be in jail. They're gonna fucking kill you nigga. This place is not for music. It's for killers and drug dealers. And I'm leaving. - I fought too hard for this dream. - Stay in Detroit if you want to. Carry this city on your back, do whatever you want to do. Just don't get killed while doing it.

It's time for me to get this shit a real run. - Cooper Street (indistinct). - This nigga been going. - If I can get him to take a plea deal for involuntary manslaughter, hell, I can get him out in three years. But the boy gonna have to keep his ass outta trouble, Bobby. (indistinct) And he'd already turned this back on you anyway. Look son, why don't you take that money you have and get the fuck out of Detroit? - I can't do that. - It ain't all of it, but it's a start.

Funerals are for those who are living after the one who has passed on. This funeral is not for our brother, Bobby. This funeral is for those of us who are still alive, that we may learn from our brother, Bobby. That we may learn from the life of our brother, Bobby. We gotta understand that we're still here, and the message he gave us, we must take into consideration. And we must live our life in accord to the message. The scripture says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word word was God. And the word became flesh and dwelled among men." Will you take the word into your heart? Will you take the word into your life? Will you live the word? We gotta understand that right now we're living in an hour where you gotta make your word your bond. Your word is your bond, and your bond is your life. And you should be willing like brother Bobby to give your word and give your life before your word fades. Our brother Bobby influenced not only the individuals in the city of Detroit, from the West Side, the East Side, Southwest, North side. Bobby affected not only Detroit, but he affected the entire world. We don't want you just to simply affect your block. We want you to affect 57 million, 255,000 square miles of land on the planet earth. You gotta understand that you're living on this planet, and what effect will you make on this planet? Will you take his message, and become a messenger of the message? Will you simply hold it in your chest, or will you take it and work it through your hands and your feet? We have to do this work. Not just simply to please ourselves, but we should do it in honor of our brother Bobby. We're out here in the world as an example of what our brother wanted us to be. And so if you are going to do this work, and you're gonna show him and have him smile down on you, then be courageous and bold in your stance. The scripture says, "Be fruitful and multiply." - How long we got? We ready? Oh, I'm sorry. Come on, everybody smile. (upbeat music) (bright ambient music) - I got more fan mail for you. It's piling up every day. - I really don't want this shit. Just don't feel the same. - That man made y'all nigga stars. Y'all put on for the city, and you should be proud of yourself. Take these two years and think. Get back out there and stake your claim. Bobby would want that. And remember this, you are Detroit Flight. (somber ambient music) - [Bobby] You know what I meant when I told you, "We is doing it for the city." I want you to continue doing that. Detroit is yours. Carry the name. And remember, the dream is to make it out. - [Fans] Flight, Flight, Flight, Flight, Flight, Flight.
