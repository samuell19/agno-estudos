(car alarm ringing) - [Woman] We're gonna be late. (car engine revs) - Going. Going. Gone. (car door bangs) (car door bangs) We'll be right back. - God forbid college boy gets his hands dirty. - He probably has homework to do. See anything, you know the score. (alarm beeping) Guard dog, guard dog! (dogs barking) Get it off, get it off! Hello, hello, gorgeous. - Ugh, I hate dogs. - [Vix] What you doing? - [Leon] Let's just get it done. - [Tod] Who buys junk like this? - Rich pricks. More money than sense. What you doing? We're here for the painting, nothing else. Go see where Leon is. - [Tod] That's worth 25k? - That's what we'll get. Worth 10 times for the right buyer. Bag it up. (suspenseful music) - Oh, shit! (car engine revs) - [Leon] Yeah? - [Chaz] They're back. The fam is back. - Gig's up, go, go, go! - [Vix] Shit. (dogs barking) - [Husband] I knew we'd be late. - [Wife] It's upstairs, I think. (dog whimpering) - [Husband] That woman would forget her head if it wasn't screwed on. Good girl, come on, in the kitchen. Come on. (car horn beeping) - [Wife] Actually, it's in the sitting room. (door bangs) (car engine revs) - [Vix] That shit was close. It's self-defense. - Not when you're in their house, it's not. Way I see it, it's a choice between knocking some chump on the head or doing a stretch. Ain't no choice at all. - My gig, my rules. If you don't like them, you can walk. (dogs barking) - [Tod] Someone get this thing off me! (car door bangs) - [Chaz] We good? - Now I'm good. Get us of here, bro. (car engine revs) (suspenseful music) - French, 19th century. The lizard represents new beginnings, a shedding of old habits. (bell dings) A symbol. (bell dings) A symbol of a true survivor. It teaches us that we can be transformed and transcend our wounds. - You'll have them shipped to the usual address? - Of course. A pleasure doing business with you. (bell dings) - [Chaz] What's her problem? - Aristocracy. They fear what they don't understand. Is that for me, Charlie? - It's Chaz. - Ottoman Warriors. Mid 18th century. Outstanding! I do have more work I could put your way. - Not interested? - Are you sure? - What's the gig? - This is easy money. - We're done. - See, you later, old man. (doorbell rings) - [Vix] Yeah, what was that? (all laughing) - Shut up. - That is a total fluke, man. Are you joking? Nice one, man. - [Tod] Yes, my friend. - [Vix] The old man say anything about the next gig? - Yeah, I turned it down. - [Vix] What? - Look, this was only ever about putting my brother through uni. You two knew that. This money's going to get him through uni debt free. Get him off the manor for good. - Yeah, and what about us? - You ain't my responsibility, Vix. - I can't believe you're shutting us down, man. We got a good thing going here, something we're good at. - You could get a job. - What, go legit? Doing what? Fucking zero-hour contracts? I'd rather be a thief than work for one. So that's that. After all, we've been through? I thought we were blood. - What, you agree with her? - He said it would be easy money. Yeah, easy by him, we take all the risk. Look, you're supposed to be the smart one. You're better than this. Better than us. - I'm not better than anyone. - So what you saying? - I'm saying we do the gig. We get the money and we move off the manor together. - Come on, man, let's do this. (suspenseful music) All right, knobhead? (door banging) (car engine revs) - - [Tod] So what is a ceremonial hunting knife? - What do you think it is? It's a knife used in a ceremony. - Okay, then what's a ceremony. - How long you lived in this country? You still dunno what it means. - It's a special occasion, like a wedding. - Then why I call it a wedding knife? - Does that look like it's used to cut a cake. It's an antique, you div. - It's a wedge in your pocket, Tod. That's all you got to worry about. (electronic music) Big man, you're up. (chains clanking) - Whoa, this is massive! No way! (car engine revs) - [Vix] Are you sure there's no one home? - [Chaz] My guy says the family's away. Off skiing, apparently. - [Vix] Sounds about right. - [Leon] Wow, I wonder who lives here? Prince Andrew? - [Chaz] Probs his cousin. You know, these lot are all related. (Tod laughs) - It's gonna take all night to search this gaff. We could use an extra set of eyes. - Yes, she's right. - We'll manage. (door banging) - Come on, bro, I'm done waiting in the van. Lemme help. - You stay by my side. - Yes! - Hey, it's about time you popped your cherry. (Chaz chuckles) (owl hooting) (door creaking) (alarm beeping) Who are you expecting? Dracula? - Relax, we're miles away from any village. No one can hear us. (owl hooting) (eerie music) - Whoa! - Right, me and Chaz will take the second floor. You two start down here and we'll meet in the middle. - [Chaz] What the fuck? - [Leon] Keep moving, bro. (door creaking) - Keep looking. - [Leon] Imagine bumping into that in the middle of the night. - [Chaz] Can't be worse than some of the girls you brought home. - Yeah. - [Chaz] What is it with rich white folks and having dead animals on the wall? You want me to get Tod? - Nah, we'll check the rest first. - [Tod] This lot ever heard of a Kindle? - [Vix] Like you ever read! - [Tod] Hey, I have an iPad. - Yeah, scrolling through Pornhub don't count as reading. - Look, I can read, you know? It just needs to be something I'm interested in. - What? Like this? I heard it's got everything. - Vix. - Love, hate, sacrifice, betrayal. - Vix! - Vix, don't mess with that, it ain't right. - You're the one who ain't right, mate. It's only a book. I'm gonna check upstairs. (suspenseful music) (eerie music) - Tod! - Screw that. (eerie music) Leon? Bro? Yo, what's good? Bro. We're not alone. - [Vix] Bingo. (mobile phone ringing) What's up? - [Leon] Get downstairs, we're bailing. - What? Why? - [Leon] Just do it. - Man needs to chill. - Vix, Vix! - [Tod] Shine torch. - [Chaz] Come on, let's go. - That's what I'm talking about. - Hello, suits you. (iron clicking) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Oh, what's going on? (eerie music) (Leon screaming) - Looks like you picked the wrong house. (punch thuds) (gentle music) (guys screaming) - Let's get on with this, shall we? I understand you're all a bit disorientated. But bear with us and everything will become clear. (guys crying) Last night you made the unfortunate mistake of breaking into my ancestral home. Now I could have called the police and had you arrested. But as I'm sure you are aware, our criminal justice system is at best ineffective and at its worst, a total embarrassment. I've always said that when a job needs doing, one must do it oneself. (guys crying) You see, there is a natural order. An order which has guided the people of this small island to the very peak of civilization. There were rulers and there were the ruled. But then you people, the working classes, huh. There used to be a nobility in your struggle. Now all you do is beg for handouts. And when you don't get what you want, (eerie music) you feel you have the right to take it. No, don't worry. This is not an execution. Where's the sport in that? - Careful, ma'am. (Leon groaning) - Oh, come on now. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Well, I think that's it. Good luck and Godspeed. (birds tweeting) (guys crying) (car engine revs) - You said the gaff was empty, man. - I was given bad intel. - We walked right into that shit. How did they get you? - They tasered me in the dark. - I never saw 'em coming. - They took my phone. - Oh, shit, mine, too, and my wallet. - So they know who we are. Perfect. - Piss, they sprayed us with piss. - What the? That's rank. (suspenseful music) - This doesn't make any sense, bro. Why did they let us go? Why did they wish us luck? (birds tweeting) - Oh, this is messed up, man. I really ain't about this Bear Grylls shit. - Huh, I love Bear Grylls. - All we need to do is find a road and head out. - Yeah, I don't see no roads, Chaz. - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. We could build a compass. - We'd be better off letting you pray for help. - No, look, look. You take needle, okay? You rub it on forehead. You then place it on a leaf and it tells you which way is north. - And then what? - Well, then you know which way north is. - And which direction is London? - I don't know. - Then think. What good is it having a compass if you don't know which direction you're going in the first place? - Let's keep moving, guys. (sombre music) - [Vix] They'll be having us drinking our own piss in a minute. - [Tod] There's no way I'm drinking my own piss. - [Vix] I'll make you, fucking nettle! - [Leon] Let's roll. (cow moos) - [Chaz] That might be a river. - What? - Did you hear that? I was pretty sure I heard something. - Wait, I can hear it. - Sounds like a car, right? - Yeah, we might be closer to a road than we thought. - Wait, I hear bass. - It's not bass. - What's that? (bugle calls) - It's a fox hunt. - Hey, hey! - What're you doing? Shut up. - They might know a way out of here. - Wait, I thought fox hunting was banned. - It is. (dogs barking) - So what they hunting? (bass heavy music) - Run! (dogs barking) (horse neighing) - Hurry up! - Oh, shit. (water splashing) Guys, I can't swim. - You have no choice. I've got him. Just go, go! - I can't. - Look, it's the river or the dogs. You decide? - Let's go, hurry up! (water splashing) - Come on, give me your hand. - Lovely day for it. Oh, don't tell me you're tired already. - Fuck you. - This is what we like to see. - Boys, get the fuck out of here. - That's right. You run along, we'll catch up soon. - Let's go. - [Remington] You're not wrong about the quarry, hm. - I told you they'd be good sport. - Their kind were born running. - What do you think, Aunt Kat? I'm told red is my colour. - We'll find out soon enough. The hounds? - They're all good, ma'am. Good to go. We'll cross the river about half a mile up and pick the scent up again. - I don't see the logic in giving them a head start. - Patience, boy, that's the thrill of the chase. - And trust me, they won't get far. (bugle calls) (dogs barking) (dogs howling) (all groaning) - What the fuck is going on? I mean, can you believe this shit? - You all right? Do you see anyone? (breathing heavily) - Don't give me that rules shit. - Fuck the rules, tool up. - They ain't gonna stop. - Then we don't stop. (sombre music) - All right, let's head towards the trees. - That ceremonial knife, we weren't supposed to find it were we? - They knew we were coming. - So the old man set us up. I'm sorry, bro. This wouldn't have happened if it wasn't. - Hey, don't even go there. The old man's going to get what's coming to him, trust. At least we're off the manor. - I was thinking more Notting Hill. (both laughing) - Ah, you motherfucking piece of shit. - Whoa, I think that's the first time I've ever heard you swear. - Whoa, wait, my crucifix is gone. - [Leon] Let's keep going, guys. - It ain't like he's helping us. In case you hadn't realised, we're being hunted. (metal thuds) (eerie music) - What the? What the fuck is this? - That's a bear trap. (metal thuds) Bro! - [Leon] Nobody move. - What the fuck is wrong with these people, man? - All right, eyes on the ground floor, follow my steps. (bugle calls) - Fuck this! - Tod, Tod, Tod, Tod! (Vix screaming) (suspenseful music) (dogs barking) - I told you they wouldn't get far. (dogs barking) - Hurry up, they're coming! (all groaning) (dogs barking) - [Vix] Come on, get up! (Tod crying) - Oh God! (dogs barking) - Come on, come on! (metal cracks) - [Chaz] Come on, let's go! Let's go! - Come on, give me your hand. Give me your hand. - Go, go, go, go! Aargh! (dogs barking) - Leon, give me your hand. Give me your hand. (teeth crunching) - Aargh! - Leon, come on! Pull yourself up, Leon. Leon, come on. Leon, pull yourself up! - You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. - Pull yourself up. Leon, no! Leon, no! (both crying) No, no, no, no! (gentle music) - I'm gonna kill every one of them. (Tod groans) We find some proper weapons and we go back. Slaughter them like the pigs they are. - I don't want to murder anyone. - It ain't murder, it's revenge. An eye for an eye. You've heard of that, right? It's in the Bible. - Well, I just want to go home. - What, and let them get away with it? - Tod's right. - Don't tell me you don't want to rip their heads off! - Of course, I do. There's too many of them. - And Leon? - Leon would have wanted us to get out of here. We get payback on our terms, not theirs. (gentle music) - One down, three to go. - Ugh. - What's wrong, boy? - Nothing. - Spit it out, boy. - Truth be told, I expected things to be a little more hands on. - You'll get your chance. (eerie music) (Leon groaning) - It looks like we've got a live one. - Wait. (Katherine clicks fingers) Miles - Why? - This country used to be ruled by lions. Now it is led by lambs. As far as we're concerned, lambs are only good for one thing. - Slaughter. (Leon groans) (blood splattering) - Don't you dare waste a moment like this looking through a lens. - [Katherine] Your father's right. - This is tradition. - It's tradition that makes us strong. Wear this blood with pride. It is your birthright. He was right. Red is his colour. - Congratulations, son. May it be the first of many. - Hear, hear. - Hear, hear. (sombre music) - Go on, give me your hand. Wrap that round the back. All right? - Yeah. - I told you it was a road. - At last. - Yeah, but which way do we go? - Let's get the fuck out of here. - Wait, someone's coming. - Thank God. - Wait, Tod, it could be one of them. - The fucker in the 4x4. (car engine revs) (door slamming) - Red one, red one. This is Mallory. Looks like we found one of them. I'm over at Bench Hill. A girl, looks like. Don't know where the others are. - Good, we're heading your way. - Yes, milady. (suspenseful music) - Right. Well, well. What happened to you, my lovely? - Boo! (metal thuds) - Come on, let's go! (Mallory groaning) - Vix, let's go so that we can get the fuck out of here. - Vix, Vix! (Mallory groaning) - Come on, bro, punch it. - Where the fuck are the keys? He must have them. - Can't you just hot-wire this shit? - Yeah, I need to open this. - We need those keys. - He's not gonna give it to us. - I'm ain't planning on asking nicely. (suspenseful music) (bugle calls) - Fuck, fuck, bro, come on. We've got to run. (Mallory groaning) Come on, come on, let's head over to the trees. (dog whimpering) (horse neighing) - You okay there, Mallory? - Yeah, ma'am, I'm fine. Smart ones, these bastards. One of them played possum, the other blindsided me. - Bloody ambush. - We're lucky they didn't take the car. They'd be long gone by now. - No, sir, that'd never happen. - Good man, now get yourself patched up. The show must go on. - Look, they're tyre tracks. There must be a farm near here. - They might have car. - Yeah, or a phone. - Who you gonna call? - The fucking Ghostbusters. Who do you think? The police! - Leon's dead, what good is it bringing feds into it? - But we have no clue where we are. - Listen, you may be clean but we have priors, yeah. They gonna start asking what we're doing up here and we end up doing time. I won't let them lock me up, Chaz. - They'll have a car or something. We'll make our own way out. (bugle calls) - How do they keep finding us? - Shit. - It's me. Look, I'll lead them away. - No, look, we should just stay together. - No, no, no. I'll double back, I'll follow the tracks. I'll meet you at the farm. Trust me, I can do this. See you there. - All right, you'd better. - Go, go! (dramatic music) - Ah! (dogs barking) (metal clattering) I don't think anyone's home. - Reckon you can start that motor? - No, I'm gonna need some keys. Where did you learn to do that? - Stepdad used to beat the shit out of us growing up. Then he'd lock us in until the bruises cleared. One night after God knows how long trying, I managed to spring the lock in my room. - Did you run away? - The fuck I did. I poured boiling water on his balls whilst he slept. That's the last time anyone ever laid a hand on me or Mum. And the last time anyone ever locked me up. (grass rustling) (water splashing) (Tod groaning) (dogs barking) - Right, ma'am, I reckon their trail split. - Then so must we. - Miles and I will head east, travel light and fast. Fetch me the hound with the finest nose, will you? - We'll head west and circle round. - Ready when you are, sir. (dogs barking) (eerie music) - Let's find those keys. (dramatic music) That's what I'm talking about. (gun clicking) (door creaking) - Whoa. (Vix chuckles) Relax, Charlie, there's no shells. - Don't call me that. - What's wrong with Charlie? It's your name, innit? - Only my mum called me Charlie. - This is all my fault. Leon was done. He'd paid my fees. He was ready to walk. Now he's dead 'cause of me. Tod's somewhere out there because of me and we're stuck here, because of me. All of it is on me. - Listen, I ain't all about rubbing your back and telling you that everything's gonna be okay. Yeah, that just ain't me. We're in the shit here, bro. And I ain't sure how we're going to get out of it. One thing I do know for absolute certain is Leon didn't do shit that he didn't wanna do. We all knew the risks. Well, not crazy motherfuckers on horseback level risk, but you get me. This ain't on you. Thinking it is only gonna put a weight on your shoulders that you can't afford to be carrying right now. You hear me? Hm? (door creaking) (dogs barking) (dogs whimpering) - They've found something. Go on, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it. What the devil? Well, Uncle, we seem to have been led astray. Now that's downright sly. - What the fuck? - Chaz, get your arse in here. (suspenseful music) - This is good. (birds tweeting) - [Katherine] Mallory? - Oh, ma'am. (phone beeps) - [Katherine] The trail has gone cold our end. Any luck down river? - Oh, no, I'm as far as Peel Bridge. They can't have got this far. - [Katherine] Agreed, make your way back to the rendezvous point and we'll catch up with my brother. - All right, ma'am. (phone beeps) Oh, bollocks. (eerie music) - All right, you little bastards! (car engine revs) - Tell me what you see. - Fresh tracks, heading right inside. - [Hugo] Tremendous. - [Miles] So now what? - Now we've located our quarry, we must flush it out here. ♪ Three little piggies ♪ - Shit. ♪♪ In a house made of bricks ♪ - These guys are whacked. - It took you till now to figure that out. ♪ So they wouldn't have to worry ♪ ♪ About the wolf and his tricks ♪ I think that got their attention. You hold here. I'll go around the back and chase them out. You have the blade? Good. Whistle, if they bolt, you blow hard. - Shouldn't we wait for the others? - Share the prize? They're nothing. You're worth a dozen of every one of them. - Forgive me, Father. - Listen, you're turning into a man before my very eyes. I couldn't be more proud of you. - He's going round the back. - Is the door locked? (eerie music) - [Vix] Grab the gun and watch that door. - But it's not loaded. - [Vix] They don't know that. (dog barking) (dog growling) (door clattering) ♪ Little piggies ♪ (spray splashing) (dog whimpering) (Vix gasps) ♪ Little piggies ♪ (sword scraping) Let me in! - [Vix] That door won't hold forever. - What's that for? - To confuse the dogs. - Turn on the gas. (paper rustling) - What you doing? - Confusing the humans. We need to take cover. - Storeroom. (door banging) - Close it! (metal clangs) (door creaking) - You know what happened when the wolf became impatient? He huffed. (Hugo grunts) - Father, I'm in. - And he puffed! (Hugo thuds) (flames sparks) And he blew the house down! (whistle blowing) (explosion bangs) (eerie music) - That came from the farm. (Vix exclaims) - [Hugo] Miles! Miles, Miles! (Chaz and Vix coughing) (dogs barking) Miles! Miles! Miles! (Hugo panting) (Hugo groaning) (Miles thuds) Miles. Oh, my God, Miles, Miles! Miles! - That was insane. - I never meant to. That was supposed to be a distraction. - Yeah, consider them distracted. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. - Holy shit! Did you see that? - Jesus Christ, see it? Meet the twisted fire starter. - Wait, that was you? - Yeah. - You made it back then? - Man of my word. - Yeah, right, come on. Come on, bro, come on, bro! (sombre music) - Dear God. - I underestimated our quarry. It won't happen again. (birds tweeting) - Relax, the spray covers your scent. - Did they not have Lynx Africa? Oh, wait, look, I just remembered. - Where'd that come from? - It's one of theirs. - Does it still work? - I don't know. - They must have some sort of emergency channel. - When are you going to get it into your head? We're on our own. This is fighting to survive here. It's kill or be killed Whatever it takes, man. Wake the fuck up, Jesus! - Hell of a thing to lose a son. Is this going to be a problem? - Hugo, this is a dog hunt. - Listen to your sister, Hugo. - I loved Miles like a son. - This was his day, and they killed him. - Remember the code. - Fuck the code! - Mallory, leave him be. There will be consequences. Always are. - No excuses, that was bad form. So, what now? - Wait, I recognise this place. Where all the signs? - They took 'em down. - Fuck, oh, for fuck's sake! Man, we're going to die out here. - Don't say that, all right? We're going to get out of here. - [Katherine] Can you hear me? We know you have Mallory's radio. Oh, don't be shy, say hello. - Maybe they don't have it? - Oh, they've got it. - You made quite the mess of things here at the farm. Was that your idea of getting even? - [Vix] Oh, we ain't even started on getting even, lady. - There you are. - We called for help. Police are on their way. - Oh, please, there's nobody within range who could possibly be of assistance. - Bullshit. I have no reason to lie. - Why are you doing this? - You came into my world, not I into yours. You broke into my home and now you are paying the price. But fear not, it will be over soon. - This isn't over until you pay for what you did to Leon. - [Katherine] You still don't get it, do you? This is my land. All of it. (eerie music) You are trespassers and you live or die by my hand. There is no refuge. There is no escape. There is only the hunt. - [Chaz] You're one sick bitch, you know that? - See you soon, Charlie. - This shit is so fucked. - Just calm down. - Calm down? Did you hear how crazy that bitch is? Are you joking? - Took you this long to figure that out? - So now what? - Yeah, he's right, you're the smart one. Now what? - Okay look, we've been running around with no sense of direction. If we get high enough, we might be able to see something. (eerie music) - Are you sure about this, Chazza? - Only one way to find out. - No, look, you got a busted leg. I'll do it, unless. - No, you go for it. When it comes to stunts of death-defying stupidity, I consider chivalry alive and well. - Okay, can you give me a boost? - Yeah. - Right, cool. - Put your foot on there. - Ready? - Yep. - Can you see anything? - No, not yet. I need to get higher. - You thought about what we're going to do when we get out here? Is he gonna be able to keep his mouth shut? I just hate the idea of surviving this shit only to fall foul of his guilty conscience. You know what I mean? - I see something. It's beyond those woods. I think it's the village that we passed. - How far? - Couple of miles. - Hm. - Chaz get down quick, they're coming! - Shit. - Get down here. - Come on, we need to get to those trees. Come on, bro, move your skinny arse. Come on! - Come on. - Quick! - All right, let's go! (car engine revs) - Come on, come on. - Stop, stop, ah. - Just go, I'm slowing you down. - Fuck that, man, we're almost out. - That don't look right, Chaz. - I can't put weight on it, just go! You think we're leaving you behind? After everything we've been through? - They know we're here. Come on, let's get him up. - Go, go, go, go, go, go! - Come, come on. No, I'm too slow, just go! - Listen, just keep heading in that direction, okay. The village is on the other side of these trees, all right. We'll catch up. - No, no, I'm not leaving you behind. - Listen, we're making it out of this together. You're just going ahead. - Yeah, what about us? - We're done running. (dogs barking) - If they make it through the forest, they'll land on top of the village. - Hm. - Amused? - Impressed, I never thought they'd make it this far. - Hm. - What the devil is that? (both screaming) - Come get us! Come on, you inbred bastards! - Come on! You want us, you come and get us! Come on! - Come on! - In all my days, I've never heard anything like it. - Well, they've got heart. - Come on! - I'll give them that. - Your running days are over. It's an uncivilised weapon for an uncivilised age. (Tod grunts) Something amusing you. - Is it true what they say about you people? You all marry your cousins. No wonder you're so fucking insane. - You have the audacity to look down on me when you're not even from here? - No, I'm from Peckham. (both grunting) (gun fires) - Tod. - Hugo? Damn fool. - I'm sorry, ma'am, the dogs are getting a bit snappy. - They're tired. - I know how they feel. - I think it's time for you to call it a day, Uncle. - And our quarry? - From now on, I hunt alone. (eerie music) - Come on, chop, chop. - Sir. It's been a while, sir. Do you think ma'am is gonna be all right? - Of course, she's a Redwick. - Right, sir. - Dear God, this is barbaric. - This is justice. They're animals, nothing more. - When we abandon civility, we become no better than the animals we hunt. - They killed my boy. - You turned your back on the code. On history, on tradition. - Takes one bad dog to ruin the hunt. - That's the difference between a hunter and a fisherman. A hunter lies in wait and a fisherman waits and lies. (all laughing) Don't do anything rash. - On your knees. All of you. Hand behind your heads. - You are in a lot of trouble. - What's up, you don't like the taste of piss? Tie 'em up. All of them. - So, what's your plan? - Shut the fuck up. Have you any idea who I am? - Yeah, you're an antique. I mean it, old man, get back! - You're not going to shoot me. You ever fired a gun? Pulling the trigger is much harder than it looks. - There's more guns on my estate than there is on yours. Why won't you fucking die? Release the hounds! - We're almost out. - We're not almost out anywhere, we're surrounded by trees. Watch where you're going. - Come on. - Watch the tree! - Aargh! We're nearly there. We're nearly there! - Chaz, slow down. - Hold on, hold on. - I'm holding on. - Look out for the lights from the village. - I'm looking for the lights but I can't see them. - We're almost out. - You're going too fast. Chaz, I can't see where we're going. Will you slow down? Shit! - Fuck, hold on, hold on! (Viz screams) I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, this is gonna hurt. Let's just, don't move, don't move. We're almost there. We're almost there. (gentle music) No, come on, come on, come on, Vix, come on - Let me go, let me go, let me go. - Come on, Vix, please. - Not me, man, I'm done. I'm done. Chaz, listen, I'm done, man. Go, go. - I'm not going. - Not just from here, go. Get off, get off the manor, be good. Swear you will, Charlie. Swear that you will, Charlie, swear it. - I swear, I swear, I swear. - Come on. - Get out of here. Go, fucking get out of here, go! - The boy got away? This stuff is older than you are. - Tastes rank. - I agree. - Where've you come from? You're half frozen. Are you okay? Are you injured? - This is not my blood. - I'm gonna call the police. Eddie, get the boy a drink. - Who did this, son? - They chased us. - Who did? - With dogs. - Dogs, we'd better lock this door, Jude. - Come on, drink up, you're safe with us. You hungry? - How about a bacon sandwich? Yes? Now, that'll do nicely. - Hey, don't you worry lad. You'll be safe in here. - Wait! - Oh, shit! - Help me, help me, please help me. - [Officer] It's all right, everything's gonna be okay. Let's get you back, see if we can sort this bloody mess out. I'm going to get you home. It's all over How many of your friends did you say they were? - Three. - [Officer] Shit. What you doing up here, anyway? - Hey, you've gone the wrong way. - There've been a lot of robberies around here, lately. - Where the fuck are we going? - Where are you taking me? Let me out now! Get me the fuck out of here, now. Get me the fuck out of here, now. No, let me out now! Let me out now! Let me out. Don't take me back. - Can I get you anything? A drink, a bite to eat? - I don't want anything from you. Last night you were happy to take what belonged to me. But what's done is done. You survived, I'm impressed. - You earned it. - That's blood money. - I understand you're upset, you lost friends today. - They're not lost, they're dead. My brother is dead. - We both lost a brother. - You're just gonna let me walk? - You have my word. - I ain't leaving without Leon. - Well, then you won't leave at all. - People are gonna find out about this. - About what? - You could go to the police and tell them your story. But who will they believe? - You think you can cover this up? - How adorable. You don't think this hunt was our first, do you? And it certainly won't be our last. (car engine revs) No one said losing was easy. But it's dealing with the loss that makes the man. (suspenseful music) (door banging)
