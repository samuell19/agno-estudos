They're showing the original "Omen" in the park on Saturday, wanna go? - I have to tutor Gabriel Saturday. - All day? - And I wanna look over my MIT questions. - Again? - Don't give me a hard time, this is important. - Lanie, I so get it. But I don't want you to obsess over it to the point where you miss out on life, okay? - Yes but they have to be perfect. - You don't have to be perfect. - If I get into MIT, I need to be good enough to get a scholarship. - You're only young once, sweetheart. Thus, why I should take advantage of this opportunity. - One movie isn't gonna make a difference. - I don't wanna spend the money on it. - I'm buying tickets. - I don't want you to spend the money on it. - I can afford $12 to spend an evening with my daughter, honey. I want to. - But it's not important. Thank you for my card, by the way. - I know you miss him. - Not much anymore, actually. - Really? - Well, you remind me of him every day. And he would have loved that puzzle. - How long did it take you to open it? - 20 minutes. - I'm glad you liked it. - I love you too. I miss you already. - Thanks for driving me. - Have a good day. Bye, Mom. - Hi, Lanie, how was your weekend? - What? - Did you have a good weekend? - Yes, I finished my programming demo for the Protean Automation internship, rebuilt my mom's old computer and completed all of my homework. I was just going over the notes for my trig test when you so rudely interrupted me to ask a completely mundane and innocuous question that I'm now forced to reciprocate. - God, I was just being polite. - Being polite means not bothering someone who's clearly reading. - Sure, whatever, bye. - Did you have a good weekend? You missed our session Thursday. - I know, this is to apologize. - Steven, you're not gonna get better at math if you don't practice. I have offered my services and it's up to you to take advantage of them. - I will, this Thursday, promise. But, muffin, it's chocolate chip. - What could be more important than your studies? This is your future. Gross. Would you please try and restrain yourselves? This isn't a cheap motel, have some self respect. - PMS much? What do you know about the 1854 cholera outbreak? Another of your research projects? Seems interesting. - As far as I remember, it was the first time science was clearly used to solve a medical problem. - That's all? - I don't know everything. How's your application coming? - Well, I think. I have a bunch of random questions to answer for the honors portion, personality stuff, you know. What's my most treasured possession. Do you think I can say my brain, or is that weird? - I think that's probably not what they're looking for. - Right, something like my dad's old tie. - Exactly. - My dad never wore ties, do you think my mom did? Wasn't that a big thing, power suits and stuff? - Why don't you help me get ready for class and you can think about it some more. - Wait, what? - Sex ed today. - No, please, no. - Yes, please, yes. We had to fight the school board to allow me to teach, so be happy about it. - I am, I am all for knowledge and education just maybe not on this exact day. - Today's the day, according to my calendar. You wouldn't want me to ignore my calendar, would you? - No, of course not. Follow the calendar and the guidelines. But maybe-- - Maybe what, Lanie? - Can I skip class today? - No. - But I'm not having sex, probably ever. - I don't need to know your sexual history, Lanie. I need to make sure you can take care of yourself when you change your mind. - I do. Condoms always, birth control too, get tested for STDs regularly. - And go to the bathroom afterwards. - What? - Urination is a proven method of clearing out the bacteria that can accumulate-- - Okay, I'll pee. - Good, then you're all set for the pop quiz I'm giving at the end of class. Bananas, please. - Yes! Oh, sweet. - All right, yes, yes, yes. Who can tell me what we're doing today? - Sex. - Exactly, today we're going to discuss what happens when a penis goes into a vagina. - Cool. - There are other sexual orientations and methods these days but this will be classic sexual education. Intercourse is a-- - A beautiful thing. - Between two consenting adults, maybe. It can lead to... - Oh god. - Some nasty complications if undertaken lightly and while not thinking clearly. - She means drunk. - In the case of sexual congress occurring, you need to take care and be aware of how to handle yourselves. - That's what she said. - Now, you should all have a condom and a banana. Tear open the packet and you'll want to use two fingers to slide it over the tip of the banana. Everyone got it? Not quite. You gave yourself a pretty big banana, try again. - Do robots even use condoms? - What is love? - Here, it's more like this. You grab it with the two fingers and keep rolling it down and you're good to go. You know, you just, you'll get better at it. You just gotta keep practicing. - Seriously, does senior year make everyone turn into rabbits? - Hey, we're just saying good morning. - Good morning. - Whatever. - You know, maybe I should tutor you. - I have a perfect GPA and tutor seven students besides you. I think I'm fine. - On friendship, you could use a little help. - I don't need friends. - What am I, chopped liver? - Oh, not to me. - Hi, excuse me, can you tell me where the principal's office is? - What did you do? - Move here? I just gotta pick up my class schedule. - Down the hall, take a right, one more left, two rights, on the right. - Uh, thank you. - Thus, while he is mostly remembered for the theory which bears his name, Pythagoras can actually be claimed as the father of both modern philosophy and mathematics. We owe him a great deal. - Thank you, Miss Burroughs. Class, anyone wanna go next? - I didn't know it was possible to make English more boring than it already is. - Joey? You seem very eager to talk. Presentation, please? - Oh, um, it's... - Can you even make full sentences? - I can make out. - That's not a relevant comment. - I saw you watching us out there. - Joey? Are you ready for your presentation today? - My dog ate it. - Your dog ate your presentation? - No, ate it. He's dead. I'm just so heartbroken, I can't focus on my schoolwork. I think I need an emotional day. Little fella got into the chocolate cake and he ate too much. I know, I know we've all had it happen but it was like, he went too far, you know. I just miss him so much. - Anyone else ready to go? Thank you, Jordan. - John Snow.

Really, it was fine. History, fine, math test, fine. Biology was all sex ed today, gross. - Sex isn't gross. - The pictures we saw were. - Scare tactics. Lanie. When a man and a woman, or whoever, are attracted to-- - Mom, I, I, Mom, I got the picture. Plenty of detail, trust me. - Sex is a basic human need. Look it up. - Is it really? - Definitely, yes. - Hello? - Hi, Steven, it's Lanie Burroughs from school. - What can I do for you, Lanie from school? - Were you serious about tutoring me? - No, that was another stellar example of my humor. - Right, good one, okay, that's all. - Lanie, I'm teasing. But, if you'd let me tutor you, you would know this. - So you would tutor me? - In friendship? Is there somewhere for me to sit? - I can get you a chair. - Rule number one, always offer a place to sit and a refreshment. - Are you thirsty? Do you want water, juice, milk? - No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just saying it's nice to offer. - Understood. - What are you doing? - Taking notes. - Why? - Well how else am I gonna learn? Or keep track of my progress? - What exactly are your goals here? Are you okay? - So... You know Jordan Wiser? - Yeah. - I wanted to sleep with him but didn't know what to do. - Oh my god. - Could you help me? - Friendship and sex are very different, Lanie. What the hell, you hated watching me and Philip make out and now you're into it? - I've been doing some research. - Oh god. - And it turns out that sex is actually a biological need, like, the hierarchy at needs has it at the very bottom so if I wanna become creative or moral or problem-solving then I have to do it, right? - That thing's really old. - 1954 is not that old. - It's older than my dad. - Steven, I am the smartest person in our class. If this was a dumb idea, would I be doing it? - I don't even know how to answer that. - I have a perfect GPA. - I know. - And I'm on my way to MIT, I just need to do this one tiny little thing, becoming a fully rounded person, completing my moral growth, and moving up the pyramid. - Just don't call it a tiny little thing. - What? - Jordan wouldn't like that. - You're referring to his penis. - I can't believe I agreed to this. - You haven't yet. Did I mention I'm paying you? - Oh god. Have you ever thought about wearing nicer clothes? - What's wrong with these clothes? - Have you heard of Target? - I dress for comfort. - What about makeup? - Girls who wear makeup are so-- - What? Strong, confident, ready to take on the world in heels? Putting on makeup is hard work, Lanie, trust me. - You put on makeup? - Eyeliner is the devil incarnate. - Fine. - Good, and get your mom to help with the makeup. - Why can't you do it? - I'm gay, I'm not Sephora. And for the record, looking nice for someone you like is not stupid, it means you care. Can I ask a question? Of course, I encourage verbal engagement and feedback. - If you wanna just have sex with someone, why not ask somebody on the football team? - Do you think that would work? - I don't know. - What would I say? - No matter who you ask, you better go on a date first. Or actually, three. - Why three? - The third date is when it's most acceptable to sleep with someone. - My mom slept with my dad on their first date. Outlier. - How do you know this? - The same way that I know that the only people who wear these shoes are - life. - Can I ask Jordan out? - Why not? It's the 21st century, be a nasty woman. And wear these, they're the best things in your closet. You could probably just burn the rest of it. Start from scratch. Aren't you cold? - Do I look bad? - No, I'm teasing. Not bad, just different. - Hi, Jordan. - Hey, Steven. - If you were looking for the opportune moment... - We could get food! - He's gone, he's gone. - But that's what I could say, right? - "How are you doing" might be a nicer start, just ease your way into it. - Understood. - You might wanna start with a movie. There's less pressure to talk. - "Would you like to accompany me to the cinema?" - Not so proper. - "Wanna see a movie?" - Just be you, Lanie. - "Wanna go to a movie?" - No, maybe don't be you. - A single cell splits by tearing off a piece of itself, thus creating a new cell. One cell division is equivalent to reproduction. An entirely new organism is created. Lanie. I called Lisa last night about your application. - Thank you so much. - Absolutely, I told her to keep an eye out, that she'd be lucky to have you. That you're a straight-A student. - Thanks. - Don't make me write you up for a dress code violation. - Thanks. - Bring it back tomorrow. - Okay. It doesn't look bad. No, it does. Yeah, no, Dr. G gave it to me. - She looks like a pillow. - But a sweet, cute pillow. - You look like a-- - You can pull it off, you don't look so terrible. He's just helping, trying. - Oh! Are you okay? I'm sorry. - Hey, it's okay, I'm good, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, you're good. I'm fine, I'm totally fine, are you fine? I didn't hurt you, right? - I'm okay. No, I'm okay, I'm good. - Yeah, yeah, you're good, so good. - You look nice today. - That was your opportune moment. - Did you get that from every movie ever? - It always works. - It made me forget about the movie thing. - This is gonna be harder than I thought. - No, I got this, I totally got this. Did Rose freak out when she met The Doctor? No, she knew what she had to do, she ran. - I don't know what you're talking about but you can't run from your problems. - No, running is the best course of action. - Oh my god, not in heels. - Lanie. - Jordan. Do you wanna see a movie? - Like, now? - No, in the future. At a chosen specific time and place, with me. - Are you asking me out? - Yes. - Okay. - Is that a yes? - Yes, an affirmative. - I knew I liked you. - You like me? - Do people go on dates with people they don't like? - I don't know. - If they do, that's really dumb and completely antithetical to the point of dating. - Yeah, I guess. - But you'll come? - Yeah, I'll come. Name the future time and place. - Tomorrow night at the mall? - Sounds good. - Okay. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, what time? - 8 p.m. - Okay. - Don't talk to me. - I did it. - I can't believe that just worked. - Me either, oh my god, I'm so excited. I feel like I'm tingly all over, I think I might pass out. Is this what being turned on feels like? - Whoa, okay, let's get you ready, come on. Literally. - Literally, not literally, figuratively, hyperbole. - Bae. - Before anyone else. - Use it in a sentence. - Philip is your bae. - Yes, good. - Low-key. - Low-key probably evolved out of down low, keep it down, it's saying something secretive that you don't want everyone to know about. - Right. YOLO. - YOLO, you only live once, so just do it. - Yeah, this one's a little outdated. - What do people say? - SYTL, say yes to life. - SYTL, say yes to life, SYTL, say yes to life, SYTL, say yes to life, got it. - Three conversation starters. - Where are you going to college, what's your favorite class this year, where do you see yourself in five years? - Yeah, good, also something normal like, what's your favorite TV show? - What if he says something I don't watch? - Then you say, "cool!" And as him about the plot. It shows that you're interested. - Okay, that's good, interested is good. - All right, last one, Jordan's best friends. - Andrew and Lucy, been friends since second grade. - I think you're ready. - I think I'm gonna throw up. - Stop twitching. - I'm sorry, you're basically poking me in the eye. - That's how eyeliner works. - This is the devil incarnate. - This is my job, honey. - You're a hairdresser, not an ophthalmologist. - Okay, I have a question. - Okay. - I found box of condoms under your bed. - Said as worded or expressed so as to elicit information, I guess I'll let that qualify as a question. - Do you know how to use them? - It's a first date, Mom. - You're the product of a first date. - I know. - And you taking this long to answer isn't making me feel any better. - Yes, I know how to do it but I'm also not gonna do it. - Sweetheart, you're 18 and this is your first real date. Get ready for your body to do all sorts of things you didn't know about. - Can we finish in silence, please? - I just want you to have fun. And be safe. And I made an appointment with Dr. Blake. - Why? - She's a great OBGYN. Birth control? - Silence. Hey. Hey. You look good. Thanks. So, what do you wanna see? - Something with robots? Would you like a refreshment? - Yeah, let's get some popcorn. - So, where are you applying? - I'm not. - Oh. - I'm gonna go on a cross-country motorcycle trip with my older brother. - Cool. - Yeah. - How are Andrew and Lucy? - They're good, they're fine, yeah. - Good, it's nice to have friends. - Yeah, it is. So why did you ask me out? Because, you know, girls don't usually do that sort of thing, so-- - Right. I just figured I'd give it a shot. YOLO, right? - Sure, yeah, YOLO. So you listen to Drake? - What, who? - YOLO. - Do you know what you want? - Yeah, can I get a popcorn and a root beer please? - Same for me. - Sure. - I like root beer a lot, it's a very underrated soda. - So is lemonade. - $18.64, please. - No, you got the tickets, I'll get this. - I don't think you know how this whole date thing works. - The guy always has to pay? - Well, yeah, usually. - Yeah, but I asked you out. - Is this like a trick to... - No, this is the 21st century. - Okay, yeah, I like it. - Cool. - Great. Here you are, enjoy your movie. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Yeah, here. - You know, you're gonna have to use the restroom if you keep chugging that whole thing. - Yeah. Good point. Oh, I can't wait to see this. - Yeah, me too. - It looks so good. - Yeah. - You don't like horror movies? - It's not that I... They're just scary. - It's over. - Okay. - Now I'll rescue someone in a burning building in the rain so it looks truly epic. - Truly epic. No, that's what guys do, though. We just wander around the city looking for burning buildings just to rescue girls. - Really? - Yeah, the easiest way to get a kiss. - Well, you know, secretly all girls wanna be rescued and carried out of burning buildings. - Oh, they do? - Yeah, we definitely prefer it to burning to death. - Oh, that's true. - You know, I'm having a lot of fun right now. - Me too. I should go the root beer's getting to me. - Hey, um. - Ouch. - I'm sorry, I'm just nervous. - You're fine, you're doing okay, okay? - I'm gonna go. - Yeah. - But I'll see you at school? - For sure, yeah. - Sounds good. Have a good night. - You too. - I can't do this, I laughed in his face. I'm not a normal person, that's not what you do. - I bet he thought it was cute. - I bet he thinks I hated it. Or that he was a bad kisser, which is not true. I don't think. - Well, you could ask someone else out, compare kisses. Make it a scientific exploration. - Well, for that to work we need some sort of control group, like a baseline. Who's the best kisser that we know? No, they have to be average. Average kisser, is that a thing? - Wow, I was joking. - Could work, though. Just science the shit out of it, round up like 20 guys and I could make out with each of them. Now only would I get better at technique, we could compare notes. - You wanna make out with 20 guys? - Well, how else do you gt better at this stuff? - You take it slow and practice with those who matter. - Philip? - Exactly. If Jordan is your Philip, he won't mind if you make a few mistakes. - I don't make mistakes. - Sometimes in life, you have to. - What are you doing? Oh my god, what? - You have to make, stop, let things be messy. Make mistakes, Lanie. - You're making a mess, Steven. Stop it, this is crazy. No, those are, I need-- - Leave it, Lanie. - No these are all the things-- - Let things be what they are. - No, no, oh my god that's gross, those are dirty. - Yeah, and they're hideous too. Look, sometimes life is messy. So you laughed in a boy's face, so what? - So-- Come in. - Everything okay? - Just backing up my point with evidence, Miss Burroughs. - Steven, how nice to see you, may I? Lanie didn't tell me you were coming over. I would have made hot chocolate. - Oh, that's alright. It's be so long, how are you? - I'm good. - He's great, Mom, super, awesomely great but we're in the middle of a tutoring session. - Oh, gotcha. Come for dinner sometime, yeah? - Sure thing Miss B. - And Lanie, door open, remember? - Mm-hmm. - Door open? - No boys in here with the door closed, house rules. - Really, I thought your mom was cooler than that. - She is, hormonal teenage boys aren't. - But I'm okay? - You're gay, I think I'm safe. - Fair. - You were making a point? - I think I made it. - As you can see, it's time we perform a little surgery. You and your partner will dissect and classify the frog and fill in the worksheet before the end of class. - Got it, cool. - Yep. I can call out the parts if you wanna write them down. - I think we're supposed to take turns, right? - Sure. - Okay, do it, do it, do it. - Okay, just hold it down. - I've got it. - Hold it down. - I got him. - Is this where the testes are? - No. - Let me. - Sex is female. - Sex is male. - Nah, see the ovaries right there? Definitely female. - No, see the testes? Male. - No, maybe they're something else, but definitely female. - Maybe those are something else. I have a perfect GPA, trust me. - My parents are doctors, trust me. - What seems to be the issue? - Dr. G, the frog is male, correct? - No, I think it's female. - Hmm. Well, you're both right. It's a hermaphrodite frog, carry on. - Shall we? That's with an F, right, hermaphrodite? - P-H. - Hi, so, I almost vomited seven times in class today. Could I have a look at your notes later? - Yeah, of course. - Okay, thank you. Oh, say yes to life. - Jordan, hey. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm a little bit nauseous right now but I'm okay. - Yeah, gross, right? - Totally. - I had a really good time at the movies. The kiss was good, it was great, it was-- - It was good, it was good. - What are you up to this weekend? - It's homecoming, are you gonna go? - To the game? - Yeah. - I don't know, I've never been to a football game. - Well then, you should go, you know, we're seniors. Scratch it off your list. - Yeah, okay. - YOLO, right? - Or SYTL. - What? - Say yes to life. - You're funny. I like that. - Thanks. - So I'll pick you up Friday? - Yeah, okay, cool. - Do you mind if I pick you up? - No, that sounds great. - All right, cool. Say yes to life. - Those things not good enough to get you on the team? - I have a knee injury, which you would know if you had been to more than one game this season. - Yeah, I'm sure that's what they all say. - Jesus. Shut up, penis wrinkle. Oh. - Hi. - I got you a water bottle. - Thank you. - So how do you like it? The high school football game. - It's great. I hope we line up in the slot a lot tonight but if they start putting much pressure on the quarterback hopefully we can get out of the pocket and avoid the sack. Of course, we do have our special teams defense and they should be able to off any returns for touchdowns tonight and hopefully their secondary isn't very good so if we throw downfield we have the chance for the long play. - Whoa. That is a lot of hopes. - I like to be informed. You've never played football? - Nope. - Me either. - I did do gymnastics though. - Yeah? - Yeah, when I was like, eight. I was pretty good, too. - This I've gotta see. - No, you don't gotta see, actually, no. - Yeah I do, yep. - Look, thankfully smartphones weren't a thing back then so I've burned all the photos, there's nothing left. - Really? - I don't know, actually. My mom probably still has them somewhere left in a basement. - My mom has pictures of me with food all over my face. - That doesn't sound as bad. - I just refused to use a knife and fork until I was five. - That makes sense, you'd fit right in. - I guess I just figured it was easier to use my hands than to use some foreign metal objects. - Exactly. You know, I can still do a cartwheel. - So can I. - No way. - Yes way, PE. - Okay, prove it then. - You prove it. - You first. - I just ate. - So did I. You ready? One, two, three. Oh, nice. That was still pretty good. - No, that was, yeah, that was fantastic. - Thanks, oh my gosh. - Hey, Lanie, you know Gatorade is a great post-sex drink? You gotta rehydrate after all that work. Hmm? - No thanks. - Suit yourself. Rip it up, okay buddy? - The game's starting. - Yeah. Hey, do you wanna get hamburgers tomorrow? No metal utensils involved, so... - Yeah, that sounds fun. - Don't laugh. - Hello, how did you get here? - I know where you live. You haven't moved since sixth grade. - How did you get inside? - Your mom let me in on her way out the door. I needed to see you. You didn't answer your phone last night. - Yeah, I was busy. - Doing what? - Performing my nightly duties as a vigilante named Toastman. - Teasing? - Yes. - Focus, third date, tonight. So we go out to dinner then we go back to his place. - Or you ask him back to yours, 21st century. - And then we just do it? - What have you done so far? - We've kissed, twice. - Yeah, he might not wanna have sex tonight. - Don't guys wanna have sex all the time? - That's a terrible stereotype that needs to die. - But it's the third date. - Okay, use this as a beta test. - Go on. - Third base, hand jobs, fingering, stuff like that and then if he wants more, go for it. - I thought you said third date was the rule. - What I'm trying to say is that there are no rules. The third date is when it's generally more acceptable to sleep with someone but if you've only kissed twice that's a big leap. - I want more, though. - Really? - I was totally fine on my own and then he had to go and do a whole presentation on science and mess up all of my plans. - Yes, be messy. Okay, you ready? Pretend this is Jordan. Mm-hmm. Don't actually do that, no. I'm just getting it ready. Just go up and down and up and down. All right, easy, easy, it's not a glow stick. Don't squeeze it like that, do not, okay. Just stroking it gently, okay, gently. Not like a dog. - Okay, it's just getting sticky. - Yep, it'll do that. - Home sweet home. - This is your place? - Yep. - Cool. I should probably be heading home. - You know my parents aren't home tonight. They're at a concert, they won't be back for a while. If you wanna still hang out. - Yeah. - Yeah? Do you wanna see my motorcycle? - Yeah, okay. - Alright. - You built this yourself? - Yeah, I've been working on her since freshman year. - This is so impressive. - Thanks. Do you wanna climb on? - Am I gonna break it? - No, you're not gonna break it, Lanie. There you go, and look at you, woo! Very, very, very hot. - What are you doing? - Rescuing you. I have trouble reading you. What you're okay with, physically. - Sorry. - Is this okay? - Yeah. - I'm just-- - Nervous? - Yeah, exactly. But I like it. - Good. - I feel like I should say thank you. - Why? - I don't know. - You're welcome? - Can I do you? - What do you mean? - Aren't I supposed to, like, return the favor? - Sure. - Oh my god, is it twitching? - Take it as a compliment. - Okay. - I'm close. - Really? - Yes. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Do you want me to try you again? - No, that's okay, I have school and homework and tutoring and so I should go. - Bye. - He just came, like that. What the hell? - What? - Third date, right, beta test? I think I'm broken. He was touching me and it sort of felt good but it kinda hurt and I couldn't make up my mind and he just stopped, and I did him like the bread dough and he just ejaculated everywhere. - Everywhere? - Like, I didn't come anywhere close to that. Can all men just do it right away, can women? What do I do? - I'm a man. I mean, yes I've been helping you with all this but at the end of the day, I'm a dude. I don't know what to tell you about your body. - Just masturbate. - No, gross. - Hey, if you wanna learn, you gotta practice. - Yeah, but not here because friends don't interrupt friends date nights. - Good luck, Lanie. Kylie! - What? - Do you have a second? - For you, in that outfit? I've got 69. - I understood that reference. - So, what's up? - Come with me. So, like, what do you do with it. Are you asking me for masturbation advice? - The best scientists go to experts in their field. - Okay, what have you done? - On myself or with someone? - Both. - Not much. Also, is it supposed to hurt? - Sex? - Fingering. - Maybe, if you're really tense. Look, you should use a vibrator and plenty of lube, okay? - What? - Oh, come on, robot girl, embrace the technology, it's right at your fingertips. - I don't have a vibrator. - You have a single mom. I am sure you have access to one. Oh, no, no, are you taking notes? - Mm-hmm, I need specific tips, area, pressure, style. - Okay, babe, you gotta sort that out yourself.

I wish he were around more. - Why are you being weird? - I'm not. You guys have just been hanging out again, it's nice. - Mom. - So? - Mom, he's gay. - Oh. Really? - Yep. - I feel like I'm so out of touch these days. - I fixed your computer. We can set you up on all the social media, you can search for stuff. - I don't know, that totally freaks me out. - It's totally normal, Mom. Literally everyone is doing it. - We'll see. - Morning. - Morning. - Let's go. - Wait, hold on. - Hey, Lanie, I hope Joey didn't ruin your night with Jordan the other night. - Nah, it was all good. - You don't really need Jordan anyway, right? - Right, thanks for the advice. - She had one? - Yeah. - You enjoyed it? - Yes. - Go girl. - You told her? - Yeah, why not? I thought it made you seem cool. Plus, she needed some cheering up. - Friends tell each other things. - You guys are friends? - Yeah, why? - I just didn't expect people from different social groups to interact so thoroughly. - You're the one that doesn't have any friends, Lanie. You decided you were better than the rest of us. - Yeah, you created your own social group. Lanie Burroughs can you please come to the principal's office? Lanie Burroughs to the principal's office. - What is it, sir? - I never thought I would see you sitting here, Lanie. You might wanna keep this to yourself. - What are you doing here? - What is this? - How did this get online? - So this is real? Yeah, in the flesh. - I can explain. - Yeah, you better because I'd really like to know how my name and everything we did ended up online and all over the school. - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? This isn't your handwriting? This isn't your notebook? - It is. - So what is this, Lanie? - It was a stupid plan. - Yeah, it was stupid. - I wanted to have sex, okay? - You don't get sex by lying to people. - I wasn't lying to you. - So when we're you gonna tell me about this? Before or after we banged? - No. - No what. - No, I wasn't going to tell you. - That isn't lying? - I was withholding the truth. - Same freaking difference. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it's too late for sorries. - I don't know what else to say. - Just stop. Don't talk to me anymore. - What are you doing here? Just kidding, I already know. Okay, grab a mop. And tell me everything. - I think everyone already knows everything. - Yeah, you really went all caveman with the pen and paper thing, didn't you? Less likely to get hacked, how ironic. - Have you done it? - The sex? - Yeah, like with a guy. - I've had sex with a guy and a girl. - And? - And which one was better? - No. How was it? It was like 30 seconds and then it was over. I don't feel any different. - What did you think was gonna happen? That you were gonna get a big old badge of adulthood? - I don't know, more than nothing. - Look, a penis isn't so powerful that it's gonna make you into somebody you're not. It's funny, I thought you'd be smart enough to realize that. - Yeah, you missed our session. - I needed to talk to Kylie. - But you could have texted me or something. My math test is tomorrow. - You'll do fine. - No, I need your help or I'm not gonna pass. - I'm really not in the mood. - Well, I'm not in the mood to be your slave but I'm doing that, so-- - You're not my slave. - No? Certainly feels like it, constantly at your beck and call to answer all your relationship drama, I have a life. - I'm paying you for those services, therefore not a slave. - And I'm paying you to tutor me so suck it up and teach me numbers. - You're mean. - Yeah, I'm mean, and I'm nice, and I'm funny, and I'm a lot of other things if you actually spend time with me. - I spend time with you. - Only when one of us is paying the other. That's not friendship. You get an F from me. - An F? - Yeah, for failure. Life's not all about numbers, Lanie. - Sometimes it's messy? - Sometimes it cares enough to listen and actually relate to another human being. - Did you steal my notebook? - I told you from the start to let things be what they are and not take notes. - So you're a logical first suspect. - The only notebook I care about is my math one. - So I'm just here to teach you math? That's all anyone ever thinks I'm good for. - I'm not the one who stopped hanging out in ninth grade. - I know, I'm a freak wanting to work hard and have a good future. - No, you're a freak for trying to do it alone. - Here's what I owe you, hire another tutor. I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. I'm sorry. We should have talked about all this a lot sooner. - No, I don't wanna talk about it with you. - I know, but we should've. We're creating a nation of prudes and it's making everything a lot more confusing and difficult than it needs to be. I signed that letter requesting the full sex education in school, I should have asked you about all of this. - You did. I didn't wanna talk about it with you. - That's gotta change, okay? - I know. - I'm really proud of you. - Why? - For pursuing a need in a smart way. - Thanks. - Besides, maybe you've convinced me to start dating again. There are some good tips in there. Will you get me one of those app things? - Yes, I can get you a dating app. - And we could compare notes. I know it's weird but sex is nothing to be ashamed of. Okay, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But you need to get your own vibrator. - Fine. Oh! - Oh. A classic. - Sorry, I just wasn't paying attention. That was not on purpose, sorry. - No, I meant the book. - Yeah, my copy's totally falling apart so I had to come get a new one. You've read it? - Yeah, it's like my favorite thing I own. - Really? You seem too cute-- - You wanna finish that sentence? - No, not really. Do you have any pets? - What? - You just moved here, right? - Yeah, yeah over the summer. - Where did you move from? - Foster. - Where's that? - It's about 30 minutes outside of nowhere. - Why'd you move? - My mom got a job at St. Barbara's. - Oh, cool. - It's been alright. - You might have to graduate with no friends. - I think I just made one. - Whoa, look at this. - We have seven copies at home. - Really? - Yeah, doctors. - Oh, yeah. - It's really interesting, though, the human body. - Yeah? - The brain, especially. It's an incredible feat of engineering. - Exactly, I mean that's the tricky part of building AI right now, the mind is just a huge unmapped space. - Yeah, exactly. - Do you think the human body has needs? - Like food and water? Yeah, of course. - No, physical needs. The hierarchy of needs has sex at the bottom, right? But sexual intimacy isn't until the middle somewhere so what's the difference? Does the body have a purely physical need for touch? - Yeah, we have to be connected to our fellow species. I guess, it's kinda what makes us human. ♪ Me and you will be ♪ ♪ Me and you together will be ♪ ♪ Me and you will be ♪ ♪ Me and you forever ♪ ♪ Cut down by the trauma written on the centerfold ♪ ♪ Will they ever know me ♪ ♪ Is my name beyond control ♪ ♪ Have I ever told you ♪ ♪ What my life could be ♪ ♪ It's a lie they sold you ♪ - Ugh, these just make me hungry. - I'm terrible at baking, too much math. - I have to go see a friend.
