[Geraldo Azevedo & Alceu Valenca's Mister Mist√©rio] * [cheers and applause] Ari: Thank you, guys. Jesus. Thank you very much. Thanks, you guys. Uh, appreciate it. Thank you, Jeffrey. [piano playing] Uh, all right, Jeffrey. Thank you. That's enough. [piano playing] All right, Jeffrey. I'm starting now. [piano playing] Thank you--all right. Thank you. Jeffrey: * Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew Ari: No, that's not part of a song. Jeffrey: * Jew, Jew Ari: Please stop that. Jeffrey: * Jew Ari: No, that song's done. How are you guys? You all right? [cheers and applause] Thank you for coming to my special. I really appreciate it. It's beautiful in Los Angeles, you guys. We live in paradise. I moved to New York last year, It's gross every day of the year. But I like it warm. I like doing outside shit. God. Some people, like, when you ask them what their favorite season is, like, winter. I'm like, "You're an idiot." I like going to outside concerts. I like going fishing sometimes. Camping, anybody ever go camping? It's funny shit. I just got into it the last few years. It's so much fun. The only problem with camping is they never really tell you the real experience. Like in the movies and stuff, it's never, like, the movies they always tell you, like it's gonna be you all alone in nature. Won't that be great? Just you all alone in the woods. You're like, "That would be great." It's never that. It's you in a tent. And you're nine feet away from another tent. And I don't know about you guys, but that close next to a single father trying to reconnect with his son... It's not the best place to do mushrooms right over here. Makes it very uncomfortable. I'm assuming that's how everybody goes camping, right? Are we all--are we all on the same page? There's no other reason to be out there if you're not on mushrooms. It's just dirty otherwise. Don't go there. It's so, so dirty. Stay inside where there's less dirt. But I guess if you're on mushrooms, the dirt goes away or something. I don't know how the science exactly, but, uh, I was on 'em once, I was with my friends. We were camping on mushrooms and I wandered away from my group for a while. 'Cause this deer came and he looked at me weird. It was like he had an attitude about it. You could tell he thought he was better than us. So I was like, "Whatever, deer, fine. You take it," and I left. And as I walked away, I came across this fork in the path, it went two different directions. On the left hand side was this really wide path. On the right hand side is this really narrow path. And I was like, "Huh," and I couldn't decide which way to go. And while I was deciding, all of a sudden out of nowhere I just--I remembered that-- that Robert Frost poem from high school. You guys remember that? Two roads diverged in the wood, and I took the road less traveled. And I'm like, "dude, I'm in the wood right now. "And there's two roads. I'm doing this shit. It's been 20 years, time to do it." And so I saw the narrow path, the road less traveled. And so I went that way. And it turns out, it's horrible advice. The road less traveled is full of thorns, first of all. It goes inside a creek for, like, 15 feet for no reason. And then it just ends in the middle of the woods and you get lost. Always take the road more traveled. It's a way better road. That's why more people travel on it. Robert Frost was a fucking idiot. You should trust most of the people that came before you. That's how Yelp works. Are you better than Yelp, Robert Frost? Are you, like, "I'm going to go to the restaurant "with only one star. 'Cause I march to the beat of only one drummer." Like, you march to the bathroom with diarrhea. Always go to the five star place, if the money's the same, always go to the five star place over the one star place. Unless it's only got one review. Yeah, then you can't trust it. Those are my favorite when you're, like, ooh, look at this-- oh, wait a minute." I always read that review. It's always, like, "My son is a good cook." Just biased journalism. It works that way with the ratings for Yelp and for porn videos. You ever get, like, "Ooh, four out of five stars. Don't mind if I do." And then you're, like, "Oh, wait. "No, five ratings, not enough. "I can't trust it. "I'll wait till there's 1,000 ratings. And then walk on the path they paved before me." And whatever, and jism, I guess, or whatever. Jism? No. Jizz. No, neither one of those is the right word. Jism. [chuckles] Does anybody still say "jism" anymore? No way, right? It's fucking creepy now. Jism. What would you do if, like, if, like, if your-- if your whatever--whoever the guy is sitting with you, if you guys were, like, doing it, and he was, like, "I'm going to jism on your belly." Would you be, like, "What-- what are you going to do? What are you going to do to my--" I'm, like, "no, on your belly." They're, like, "no, no. "I heard where. Give me the verb. What was the verb you used?" Jism. That's how you talked in the olden days. In the Lord Of the Rings days, that's how they used to talk. But they'd be all--they'd be like, "M'lady." I mean really, "M'lady. I'm about to jism upon thine belly." But they'd be about to come, so they'd be, like, "M'la-- [shivers] It's a true story. Look at Lord Of the Rings 2, the director's cut. It's in there. It's all a real thing. You got to wait for it to be rated high enough, and enough in there. Go by--what did they do in the old days? In the dark days of porn? 2007? Can you imagine living in those times? You're better to just look at the picture and be, like, "All right, I'll trust it." It's crazy how the other generation used to live. No, now we have a whole rating system set up. We can use that for our benefit. Robert Frost wouldn't. He'd be jerking off to one-star porn. He'd be like, "Oh, it's someone having lunch. All right, uh, well, I've committed to it." Blaze my own path. Here's my question: Who's rating porn videos? Like, who's finished with that act, and then instead of immediately leaving the scene, in disgust at your mid-day decision, who's returning to the scene of the crime like a fucking arsonist? For what? Why? You're like, "No, I care about my community. And I want others to know that Becky does like it hard." Why would you do that? It's not even that simple. A lot of times you got to register a profile first. Do you know how detailed a process that is? Just to give your opinion on co-ed naked anal. You're like, "I didn't care for the anal at all. There was just barely any of that." That means you got to give them an e-mail address. To a porn site. And just trust that they're gonna be cool with it. And then wait for them to e-mail you a verification code, which you take and go back into the system, sign up for a whole profile and then be like, "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Read it, yep. I'm into it." Why would anybody do that? Here's why I do it. [chuckles] I just know what I know. It's 'cause it keeps track of all the videos you liked. It keeps a record of all that, that you can access. So at the end of the year, when Chanukah comes around, my--my gift to myself is I have a best-of week. I go back and visit all the girls that got me through the year, you know. It's like a greatest hits. You guys, I'm gonna give you a fun prank you guys can all play on each other right now. Uh, here it is, you have to play with homeless people. What else are you gonna do with them? Let them into your hearts? I don't see that happening. So, here it is, when you're with somebody you like-- Uh, are you guys dating or anything? No, not at all, just some girl you say next to. Your sister. Oh, gross, dude. You fuck your sister. Eww. That's disgusting. All right, works with your sister too, if you care about somebody. You care about her? I guess, if you brought her to this thing. Yeah, man. Get that. Oops. Do what you got to do. So let's say you're driving, she's in the passenger seat. You know how homeless people come in between the lanes and, like, look for charity from cars? So here's what you do. When the homeless guy gets right up towards the passenger-side window, you hit her with a roll-down on that window. And then watch the sparks fly. It's a 100% win every single time, 'cause neither one of them expects to hear the window sound. The homeless guy or your sister. It's just like a--you're just all of a sudden... [buzzing] And the homeless guy's like, "What? Yeah. Sounds like a sale." And he'll--he'll lean forward. And then watch her just panic. Watch her not handle the pressure. Just be like, "Yeah, and what-- [screams]" There's a homeless guy right there. They'll be like, "No, I'm so sorry. "There's no money for you here. I'm so, so sorry. "There's been a horrible misunderstanding. "There's no money for you here. "Oh, my God, you smell so much worse "than I thought you'd smell. "And I thought you'd smell terrible. "There's no money for you--let go of the button, please. "Let go of the button. It's not funny anymore. He's playing a joke on us. Go away." You guys can all do that, you don't have to give me credit. For the betterment of humanity. I just want that out there. You guys watch that show Walking Dead? I like it. It's realistic. That's what I like about it. Not the zombies. Whatever. But I mean the way they handle zombies. Because in every other zombie show or zombie movie they always do this scene that I fucking hate. You know how you'll see somebody and they've been turned, you know, somebody you knew from before like your next door neighbor or your wife or something. And then they're coming up, but they're zombie version. They always do this and I fucking hate when they come at-- And they're like, "Margaret! I know you're in there. "I know a part of you is still human. You got to fight it, Margaret." It's just--it's dumb. It's dumb. If you're a zombie, you're a zombie. That's the end of it. And plus, here's the deal. I don't have a wife. So if I was a zombie, what would my last piece of humanity be? I think that my last piece of humanity is that I'm a comedian. And so it would result in me, like, just eating people, um, dick first. I think that's the way I'd express my creativity. In the apocalypse, you know? I'd be like, [groaning]. And you'd be up against a wall, you'd be like, "Oh, no." And I'd be like, [groaning]. And then I'd--I'd unzip your pants. Just to watch you struggle to understand what's happening. Just be like, "Wait. Wait, what do zombies do?" And then I would bend over and slowly pull it out and like wipe it off, and, like-- And then you're friends would come running in to help you. You'd be like, "No, no, no. Leave him alone. "Let's see where he goes with this. "I haven't met all the zombies, maybe this one's cool. Maybe this one's really, really cool." And then I would, like, I would eat your dick. I'm, like, a zombie, man. I'm gonna eat your whole body eventually. That's going to happen. But nobody said I can't start with dessert. That's not a rule. You guys, true or false? If you were a zombie, the dick and balls would be the best part of the human. man: True. Ari: "True" is the right answer. Yes, absolutely, you got it right. It'd be the delicacy, guys. It would. Like if you were a father zombie, you'd be, like, "Hey, I get the dick and balls." "When you kids are old enough to put humans on this table, "then you can have the dick and balls. But until then, I work very hard--" All right, whatever. But I tell you, it'd be refreshing. That's the thing. Like the balls, when they popped in your mouth. No, don't say "Eww." You're thinking like a human. You can't think like that. You're a different species now. You'll never survive in this world. It'd be very refreshing. It'd be like that gum that has the juice on the inside. You know, that you're not expecting, you're like, "What's the--Oh, wintergreen." True story. [chuckles] True story. Hey, um, uh, do you guys-- How many people by round of applause ever do mushrooms? [applause] Oh, wow, a bunch of you. That's cool. How many people do not do it, or acid or any sort of psychedelic? [light applause] A few? Fucking my crowd. I love it. You guys are all hippies. They're the greatest. I've heard a couple people give reasons why they shouldn't take mushrooms, or any sort of psychedelic. There's two reasons I've ever been given for mushrooms. Well, three. Jesus is one. You're not gonna argue with that. Like, if he's in your life, fucking, do what you want I guess, but... The other one I've heard is, uh, is they're afraid the taste of the mushrooms will be too bad. They'll taste too bad. And I'm here to tell you, that's 12 seconds of the 9 hours. You should not let that affect your decision at all. And then the other reason I've heard is people go, "Well, I'm scared. I'm scared something bad's "gonna happen to me. You know, I'm gonna freak out. Something bad." And I'm here to tell you, nothing bad will happen to you. The universe will look out for you. Like, I'm not talking about God or anything. I'm just saying that the universe has a way of protecting everybody that's on mushrooms. So nothing ever bad, ever happen-- All right, once every 10 years somebody tries to hug a bus or something, but... Those are outliers. Those people just exist to make your trips more exciting. And generally, just make sure you're okay. Like, I took them once in San Diego-- They have this comedy club-- Comedy Store has a comedy club in San Diego and they put you up in a condo. A lot of clubs will do that instead of a hotel. And they're always disgusting. They clean them, like, every two years or so. We always think about, "Ew, Roseanne fucked here." [chuckles] That's what we always say. I don't know why our minds go straight to that. That we assume it hasn't been cleaned since then. "Ew, Roseanne fucked here." Why Roseanne? I don't even know. No, I do know. I know. Um, so, uh, I stay there a bunch. The location's great. That's the cool thing. It's like you got back porch, then boardwalk, beach. It's right on--in P.B. It's fucking amazing. And I've stayed there 100 times, nothing's ever been off the back porch before. But this one time, we're all there taking mushrooms. And right off the back porch was this mother and son, and they were selling glow sticks all night. And I don't know if you know how to sell glow sticks, but this is how you sell glow sticks. We would just go out there and just be like, "Wow. This is amazing! Thank you, universe." Just staring, for like 40 minutes at a time. We would just go out there and stare. They probably thought they were real close to making a sale. They were not. We got all we wanted for free. I'm telling you, it looks out for you. I think on any sort of psychedelic drug. 'Cause there were these campers that were in California last year. Do you guys remember them? They got lost, they found them. Maybe you don't. but they got lost for, like, a few days. They didn't mention drugs in the story at all, but, it was, like, obvious. They asked them when they rescued them all-- They asked them, like, why they wandered off. And they go, "We saw a pretty cloud we wanted to touch." Like, how is your next question not, "What were you on?" They found the first girl after a day, and uh-- Where'd you go? There you are. And her mouth was so full of dirt from eating dirt, It's more than hunger, it had been 17 hours. That's how long it was. She was fucking shoveling dirt into her mouth. They couldn't even give her water. They had to shovel the dirt out of her mouth, 'cause if she had drank water, she would have suffocated. They found the second guy after two days, and he was fine--100% naked, but fine. And then--no mention of drugs at all. And then the last guy, they found him halfway down a cliff after five days, which nobody seems to understand what that means. That means, like, if those whole thing is a cliff, that means he was just, like, here... where, like--even mountain goats don't go there. Birds were flying by, going, "What the fuck is that? When did they move in here?" They ask him how he got there, he goes, "I don't know." This is his real answer of how he got there, he goes, "I sort of remember scooting down an embankment." I'm like, "Dude." And my friends are, like, "See? What about those people? They weren't fine." I'm like, "No, they were fine. "Nothing bad happened to any of them. "Wake up on the side of the cliff, unhurt? Dude, I'm telling you, the universe will look out for you." Don't be scared. Well, do be scared, I guess. But that's fine for it. How many people like acid more than mushrooms? [scattered applause] Yeah, a few of you guys. I don't know what you're talking about. Acid is so much scarier. It's so--I'll still do it. But it's super frightening. I've taken them, like, three times. I took them at a UFC one time. [chuckles] Yeah. It was so much fun. It was me and two friends. One of the friends didn't want to take it. He was like, "Really? You guys want to take acid at a UFC? "In front of 15,000 screaming fans and people punching each other until they're bloody?" He was like, "This sounds like a horrible place to take acid." And I was like, "You sound like a boring person "to take acid with. Problem solved. More acid for us." It was so much fun. It was so great. All the lights were going out, everything was exciting. This guy Anderson Silva is like the best fighter in the world. Probably of all time. He kicked this guy in the face and knocked him out. Like, they were just standing there and he just kicked him in the face, knocked him out. Everybody started cheering. I just screamed for about 4 1/2 minutes. Just full volume. [screaming] Just unstopping. God, it was fun. Great experience. All the lights would go down at once. It looked so cool. And then, uh, a couple fighters, they had for their entrance music, they used Black Sabbath. Which I was never really a fan of before. But when I heard that on acid I was like, "Who the fuck is this band? It's the greatest band of all time." Yeah, case in point of the universe looking out for you. At that fight-- At that UFC fight. I remember in the middle of the fights-- I remember in the middle of the fights I got really cold. 'Cause on certain drugs, your relation to temperature just goes out the window. Alcohol is one of them. If you get drunk, you can lay outside in the snow. And be like, "I'm gonna lay here." "You're gonna be cold." Like, "I've got shorts on! I'll be fine." You just don't feel it. It starts raining. You're like, "It's raining out here." They're like, "Whatever. I need a bath." What's-it-called is one of those things. Uh, acid is one of those things. So I remember shivering cold at this UFC fight. Turn to my friends, like, "You guys cold at all?" But they were both, like, "No, I'm really hot." And I was, like, "Yeah, totally." So I was looking down. So I didn't notice that the T-shirt cannon girls had come out. And they start firing off T-shirts into the crowd. With those T-shirt bazookas, you know? I looked up and I saw them, and immediately I figured out everything I needed to figure out. I was like, "Oh, I have one T-shirt on now. "And I'm cold. "If I were to get one of those T-shirts, "Well, that would double the amount of T-shirts I have. I'd be a lot less cold." I turn to my friend, I'm like, "Dude, I want one of those T-shirts." And he goes, "That's cool. "But why did you just say all that about the one T-shirt and the two T-shirts?" And I was, like, "What? No, I was just thinking all of that." And he goes, "Okay, maybe. Maybe. "But if you were just thinking it, then how did I know about it?" And I was like, "Yeah, how did you know about it?" But I was like, "But I can't deal with that right now. 'Cause I'm fittin' to get one of them T-shirts." But I'm 30 rows up, there's no way I'm gonna get one. But I swear to God this happened, I swear to you. This one T-shirt girl, she already cocked, so I'm like, "I want a T-shirt." She goes... She turns right at us-- I swear this happened! It did, I swear to you! I was on acid, my memory's not the best probably, but, like-- And she fired one up and it goes up and off my friend's hand and right into my lap. And I just undid it, and I put it right on. And I was like, "Thank you, universe!" And I went back to doing this for like 4 more hours. Do more drugs. Woman: Yeah! Ari: Audible scream from that girl, "Yes. More drugs." I just moved to New York by the way. Like a year ago. man: Whoo. Ari: Thanks, one dude. You don't have to cheer, you know, it's okay. You're like, "I've heard of it. Does that count?" No, don't worry about it. It's weird. It's been pretty cool. I lived here for a long time then I moved to New York. It's been fun. I play this game. I just walk around the streets playing this game called, "Why would I have touched that?" Oh, so fun. You guys got to do it if you're ever there, you just walk outside on a sunny day, you just see anything--any object and you look at it, and you're like, "Oh, that's so interesting." And then you decide to touch it. And that's when you notice that it's far more moist than you thought it would be. You pictured no moist, but it's far more than that. And so the next move is you recoil in horror thinking about the Ebola that's on your hands right now. And then you look inwards and you go "Why would I have touched that?" And that's how you win. I'm really good. It's fun, New York. Only problem with New York is the weed situation. The marijuana situation is horrifying. I didn't realize. I started smoking pot here. I didn't realize how spoiled I was... until you go somewhere else. God, it's fucking terrible out there and it's hard to find. Like if you guys, right now-- let's say you guys finish the show and you all want to go outside and nobody has any weed--which is definitely not the case. But, like, uh--with my crowd. If you were out, you'd be like, "Let's go to the store and buy more weed." That's what you would do. Like a grown man would do. Those are you errands, "I got to get trash bags, light bulbs and marijuana." If you're in New York and you run out of weed, you just have to be without weed. Like a fucking immigrant. Or you wait until someone in, like, a shitty part of town walks by you and they go like this, they'll go, "Weed." And they just keep walking. And then it becomes your responsibility to go, "What did you say?" And then they go, "What did you hear?" And that's the way you buy marijuana. And the reason they say, "What did you hear?" Is the because they've actually been saying the name of, like, four or five different drugs. But the only one your brain let you hear is the one you're addicted to. So to other people it sounded like, "[mumbling] Percocet, [mumbling]." And it's all terrible. First of all, they don't even sell regular amounts. They don't sell grams or eighths. They sell these things called "50s." Yeah, which is however much weed they want to give you for $50. See, that's not a measurable amount. I'll be like, "Hey, man, this seems really light today." And he'll be like, "Well, how much did you give me?" I'm like, "I gave you $50." He'll be like, "Well, perfect." It's fun there though. I just take my shirt off and walk around all day when it's warm. It's weird when you take your shirt off in the city, people leave you the fuck alone. You've become part of the problem. Which I love. I can just be by myself. They'll start like, "Hey, man, do you have the time-- uh, hey, do you have the time?" It lets you just observe. It's pretty fun. Here's something I noticed. You ever walk down the street and pass by a really hot girl? Like really hot. Like Kelly Bundy hot, you know? There's this thing that happens, it's a social construct where as you're walking--as you pass them everyone will sort of turn and look at the girl as they walk by. That's it. You don't fucking grab a tit or anything. You just, you know--just look. They're hot. Girls will look too. Guys will look because they'll be like, "Wow, she's so hot." And girls will look so they can be like, "Skank." Like that. Nobody hates girls more than girls. But at some point, I realized hot girls want you to look at them. That's why they're wearing a black mini-skirt dress at 4:00 p.m. on a Wednesday. They want the attention. I don't like hot people, because they have life better than us. So I refuse to give them the attention. When I pass by a really hot girl, I look straight forward, I don't blink, I don't flinch. Like, "Oh, here she comes." Am I looking? Nope. No attention. Choke on it. And I let her go. But then--but then here's what I do, 'cause I like women. So right when they pass by, really creepily, I'll just sniff in. You guys ever do one of those? That's some good creepin'. That's fun. As they go by, like, "No, I'm not looking at all. I'm interested in other things." And then I, like, [sniffs]. [exhales] That's how you own a bitch. That's what I'm talking about. New York is cool though. Best part of New York? No actors. Yeah, I mean, there's a few, but they don't run the city like they do here. They fucking run this town. They think they're so fucking important. Actors are the most overrated people in the world. They don't do anything for society at all. And by the way, it's not even that hard. Any of you, with like a month of training could be like a really good actor. You couldn't be the best of the best, you couldn't be like that guy that died in the hotel room of heroine. But you could be pretty good. You could be David Duchovny good. You could definitely be that good. Well you've heard about the awards shows and stuff, they think they're so fucking important. They're like, "You know, I'm just trying to change the world and make a difference." It's like, "Shut the fuck up! "You play pretend for a living. "You're entire job is an extended recess, all right? Fucking get over yourself." Who keeps yapping over there? Which one of you guys keeps yapping? What, are you kidding me right now? Whoever it is, just fucking stop. It's really--Oh, nobody said anything. I was just acting. That's how easy it is. That's how crummy their job is. They just play pretend. People are like, "Really?" No, not really! It's a skill I mastered in kindergarten. One of you guys just told on the other one too. Someone was, like, pointing. Like there was no noise, but somebody was fully telling on somebody else to get the heat off them. You would have been horrible in the Holocaust. They were like, "No, officer. I haven't seen them here "around here in a long time. "I think you got rid of them all. "Really, no, I haven't seen any. None of them around. "Get them. Get them all. Get them all! That one has a diary. Leave no legacy." Fuck actors. And there was a moment too, where I realized they took themselves too seriously. There was a moment where it came to me. Where I was in the acting class-- I'll do it for money. Whatever. It's easy money. You just catch a beer and go, "Oh, Bud Light?" $10,000. That's an entry-level position in acting. And so I was in the acting scene and I had to do this, uh-- I had to do a scene where I had cerebral palsy. Why do you guys laugh at that? That's not the funny part. By the way, if you guys want to know what cerebral palsy is, they're like the king of the retards. I'm saying, they're the best of something. It's a compliment, if anything. Unless you don't think they're the best ones, then I think you're wrong. What's the problem? There's a clear order in the retard community. You don't think someone with Down syndrome looks at someone with cerebral palsy and goes, "Oh, I wish that was me." Down here. The only one that comes close to competing with them is those guys that count jelly beans good. They might be the king. You know what the bottom rung of the retard ladder is? It's too much. So here's when a hot-- Fuck it, I'll just tell you. Here's the bottom-- Here's the worst of the re-- The guy who's just like all head and, like, a little Mr. Potato Head body. They can't do anything but blow and move. [blowing] Those people make you feel good about yourself. I was with my friend Lawrence. We were playing in a poker tournament in Las Vegas, and I passed one of those guys. I was bitching about some bad beat. It wasn't--I wasn't even out. It was just at a break. And I was like, "Fucking 10-2-- Who the fuck plays a 10-deuce? It's ridiculous. The luck I have." As one of these guys is just wheeling past me. I was like, "Nobody has more bad luck than I-- "Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. "I'm cool. Let's just walk. "Let's just walk around for a little while. Let's just enjoy that." So here's when I realized actors took themselves too seriously, this is the scene I did. I had to pretend like I had cerebral palsy. So if you know anything about it, for real, your mind is completely fine, but your body just gets fucked up. Half the muscles in your body, left side or right side. They'll all at the same time they'll clinch and then let go. Clinch, let go. Clinch, let go. Like, legs, chest, arms. All--it just never stops. So at the end of this 5-minute scene I was really tired. And the teacher was like, "It's tough, huh?" I'm like, "Yeah." And he goes, "Well, now imagine what it would be like... to be Daniel Day-Lewis and to have to do that every day, for three months, like he did in the filming of the movie My Left Foot." And I was like, "Um, I think what you should have said-- "If you didn't take your job too seriously... is, 'Now imagine what it would be like to have cerebral palsy!' "What are you talking about? Be Daniel Day-Lewis? "First of all, that sounds awesome. "I would love to be that guy. "He probably has a hot tub inside his house. "That guy's fucking cool. I would not love to have cerebral pal--" All right, you get it. Hey, um, I discovered something recently about racism. Tell me what you think. It's not racist, don't worry about it. Everybody gets weird when you bring up racism. But you ever go to a party and have somebody talking to you-- Like somebody you just met and they get, like, way too racist? You know, especially for someone you don't even know. We all talk about other people, but when you know everyone around you. You don't just whip it out in the middle of nowhere. And then it's like not even funny, it's just like, racist, racist, racist. And you're like, "Eww." And I don't know about you, but I get this weird empty feeling in the pit of my chest. Where it's just like, "Eww," and you just get grossed out and you have to leave. You don't try to get them fired. You just fucking leave. But then, I thought that feeling was 'cause I was against racism, but then I saw this comedian onstage recently. This comic--and he was really awful. He was just terrible, Doing jokes I've heard 1,000 times before. Totally unoriginal. And I got that same empty feeling in the pit of my chest. And I was like, "Wait, that's the racism feeling." And that's when I realized, "Oh, it's not racism I'm against. It's the fucking unoriginality of racism." It's these stereotypes that are 40 years old that they're still throwing down our throats. Like, when I moved to L.A. they told me Mexicans were all lazy. But every Mexican I met had nine jobs. And I'm a Jew and I have zero jobs. Like, I'm not saying don't be racist, I'm just saying update you're shit. It's a whole new world out there and watermelon is delicious for everyone. But, with that in mind, here's a couple new ones I observed. Here's the most--Uh, you ever get off, like, a subway or an elevator or bus--Any door that opens up like that. From side to side. If you're trying to get off and before you can get off someone else tries to push their way on, that person is a Chinese person. 98% of the time. 98% it's a Chinese person. 2% they're blind. Those are the only options. Anybody, like, "Ari, don't even--You have to say Asian, not Chinese." I'm like, "No, no, you're being racist. It's specifically Chinese people." The other ones get it. Japanese, Koreans are, like, "Yeah, obviously. You get off first, "and then when you're all out, then we get on. How else would it be?" Not Chinese, that's a whole different breed. I see them too, the Chinese people through the door of the subway. When the subway stops, before the doors open up, I'm like, "Hey, you. You. We go first. "You're to the side. We're one, you're two. "Get over. Look at everyone else. Get over." And they're just like, "Not in my culture." Fucking mainlanders. Here's another one. Here's another racist or racial term that I've heard. Uh, how many black people in here right now? By round of applause? No way, just one. Come on. All right, just one. Get her. Let's get her. [laughter and applause] Really? Nobody else? All right, fuck. I got a specific draw, huh? All right, please repres-- Where the fuck were you? You're right behind her. You just left her in the lurch. He's like, "I'm not joining in this. I don't know where it's gonna go." You're Chinese? You ain't Chinese. So two black people, whichever other ones are too cowardly to fucking say it right now. By a round of applause, you two, how many of you guys, um, take--how many of you guys take mushrooms? Yeah, black people don't like mushrooms. That's a new thing, black people do not take mushrooms. I have no idea why. I asked my friend Michael Che about that, and this is what he said, he goes, "Yeah, you're right. I didn't take them either. Neither did any of my friends." He goes, "I think--I think maybe it's because mushrooms are too adventurous for black people." I was like, "Dude, crack is way more of an adventure. I don't think that's the answer." I think it comes down to this--and it's a real thing. You guys got to tell your community. Let them, like, spread it out. It's a wonderful drug. I think it comes down to this. I think it's because mushrooms are typically associated with camping. It's just not a black experience. I think that's what it comes down to. I think that's all it is. Hey, you guys--Okay, here's the deal. So that's a lot of comedy so far. But I wanted to do a quick public service announcement. 'Cause I'm gonna do a lot. I'm gonna do over an hour. They're not gonna use all this so I just wanted to, like-- I have a cause I like to share with people because it can't all be about jokes, you guys. You know, you got to get serious once in a while. Um, here's the deal. The morning blow job. What happened to it? Thank you a couple chuckles from frustrated men. The rest of you--the morning blow job used to be a staple of our society. And now it's becomes like the humpback whale. When's the last time you gave him a blow job first thing in the morning? Laughing! I tell you, it's ridiculous. Fuck you! It's the greatest moment in a man's life. And you guys, you have the power to give that to us. You don't understand, if that's the way we start the day, nothing can hurt us after that. We're just champions the rest of the day. Impenetrable to pain. And I mean start our day that way. Like wake up, like, [yawns]. " Hey, what the fu-- Yeah! All right. We're gonna smile for 24 straight hours. Someone else gets a potion at work, we're like, "Hey, man. Whatever." "I got a blow job this morning so I'm fine. It'll take a lot more effort on your part." And I get it by the way, from a woman's point of view. I understand. I get it. First thing in the morning, you don't want to have a blow job-- fucking penis in your mouth. You have a blow job in your mouth. I don't know what that means. That means you have to completely swallow up two people. [muffled] "Guess what's in my mouth." You're like, "Uh, I don't know. Marbles?" [muffled] "No. You're never gonna guess. It's a blow job." You're like, "What? I thought you said there's a blow job in there." [muffled] "There is." And you fucking pull out two people having oral sex. I understand. First thing in the morning, you don't want to have a penis in your mouth. Sure. Absolutely. That sounds like a horrible morning to be honest. Honestly, I can't think of a worse way to start your day. I can't think of a possible worst way to start your day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping. You're eyes flutter open. It's a new day, anything's possible. Nope, dick in your mouth. Sure, I get it. I get where you're coming from. Absolutely. But we really want you to do it. So not every day, but once every fiscal quarter, it wouldn't fucking kill you. It's the greatest thing. And if you do it, by the way, if you decide to be cool and do it, don't do it tomorrow 'cause they'll be expecting it. But, like, sometime soon do it. And if you do it, if--and, uh, and, uh, don't start making demands at the end like you're Mother Teresa and you changed the world. Just let us have the moment. Don't start going, like, "Well, you know, I did that for you. "So it wouldn't kill you to empty the dishwasher once in a while. Take out the gar--" No, you shut the fuck up. Do it and then you leave the house. Let us have the moment. Just get your briefcase and just go, "Your honor," and you fucking go to work. Not every day, just sometimes. What time do you set your alarm for every day? Woman: About 7:00. Ari: Fucking unemployed Los Angeles. You just wake up whenever you wake up? Woman: I work at night. Ari: You work at-- So you just still-- you wake up, like, 5:00 P.M.? Woman: Yeah. Ari: [groans] That girl just--just had a disgusted sound at you. She literally goes, "Ugh." Like you're beneath her. What do you do for a living? Woman: I work in room service. Ari: In room service? Woman: Yeah. Ari: Oh. Prostitute? [indistinct] not connecting. 'Cause that makes you a prostitute. If you connect with a high five, that definitely would make you a prostitute. It was very smart to pull away. Well, let's say you wake up at 7:00 A.M. every day. Most people wake up-- whatever time it is, it's the same time. And every day, 7:00 A.M., the alarm goes du-du-du-du, and you're, like, "All right," and you get up. But sometimes your eyes pop open early. Just randomly on their own. And you feel like it might be time to get up. But you look at the clock and you got all this time. Sometimes you wake up at, like, 3:00 A.M. And then you look over, like, "Oh, fuck yeah. Four more hours of sleep, bro." That's a great feeling. But then sometimes you wake up and look over, and it's, like, 6:56. And you're, like, "What the fuck? Four minutes? What the fuck am I going to do with four minutes?" You can't go back to sleep. That's not even a full snooze cycle. You will oversleep. And nobody ever in the history of work has ever just "gotten up" four minutes early, and just started, like, "Well, I'll beat traffic today. All right, let's do this." Nobody--"So what are you doing? Stan, what are you doing?" You just lay there. For four minutes. Just hoping that today's the day that time stops. And then, of course, 7:00 rolls around, like, du-du-du-du, you're, like, "All right, shut up," and you get up. And you've wasted four minutes. Do something productive with that time. Make your husband or boyfriend love you more. Oh, that's allowed, by the way, just so you know. That's a side effect of morning blow jobs. We will love you more. "There's no more my man could love me." Yes, there is. Try it and you'll see. Don't do it early. Wait till 7:00. He didn't wake up early. You know, don't punish him, but, like... Be ready right at 7:00, like, hand over the alarm clock. When it--du-du-du, you're, like... And you're, like, one motion, like, your neck should already be moving. Like a short-stop, you know, you want action in the legs before the hit comes. So you go by the direction. Yeah, I've had girls say this too. They're, like, "Well, if he wants to go down on you "first thing in the morning, how about you go down on us first thing in the morning?" That's a fair comparison. "You want a blow job first thing, We want a slurp job, or whatever." I don't know what it is. Is there a term for that? There should be a term for that. And to that, I say this. I say, one, you're absolutely right. Guys, you should do that once in a while. Lean over and just slurp away, especially if you have a dry mouth. That's the perfect time to do it. You absolutely should do your part too. But--but it's not the same thing. It's not the same thing, 'cause there's about two or three days every year where I don't know what happens, but the blankets just trap the air in to your area. And the fucking smell that's coming out of that thing smells like a-- like a urinal cake in a Tijuana asparagus factory. Noxious fumes. Should be researched by Syria for chemical warfare. Open it up like a grilled cheese sandwich. "Ew" is right, you're getting my point. I would rather eat chicken left in the sun all day than ever go down on you one of those two or three days of the year. So it's not the same thing. it's not the same thing at all. And they're, like, "Well, your balls smell too." "No, no, they don't! No, they don't." Our balls smell a little bit every day. You guys have flowers and sunshine. Flowers and sunshine. [yells] Back to flowers and sunshine. You don't know what you're walking into. The movie Backdraft was based on. So it's not the same thing. But--but, we'll still do it if we want to get a blow job in the morning once in a while. We'll hold our breaths like Navy SEALs, and we'll do our duty. We'll be, like... [inhales deeply] [gurgling] [gurgling and gagging] It'll be like two magnets turned the wrong way, you know? Like... And if you guys decide to do it, if any girl in here decides to be cool, fucking strengthen the bond of marriage, whatever. For whatever reason, your husband or boyfriend, if he stops you, he was just startled. Give him another chance. That means it had been too long. He didn't know what was happening. I've been there. I've been there. It's a horrible feeling. Once you understand what you missed out on, it's a horrible feeling. You could wake up, and be just, like... [yawns] "Hey, what the fuck? What are you doing down there? "That's--oh, no! No! "No, please! No! "I mean, no! "No! "No! "Oh, please! Wow, you're really strong by the way." And that's my public service announcement. Now back to comedy. How about that? I was reading the Ten Commandments recently. I was bored one day, whatever. I was masturbating, and I got bored in the middle. No. I was just Web surfing. You know how Web surfing starts. It's just that you go anywhere. You don't know. It's not like I was looking for the Ten Commandments. Start with, like, shark attacks, and you go to "who invented the pencil," and then you go "why did someone invent the pencil," and then you just-- all of a sudden you end up at the Ten Commandments. And that was--yeah, I hadn't read them in a long time. I remember when I was little. Have you guys read them? Do you guys know what I'm talking about? "Thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal." All those. So it was the first time I came to them with, like, a really fresh, clear, adult mind 'cause it had been so long. And I realized what they were. Ten Commandments? That's just a list of rules. Like that's all it really boils down to, like, "Here's how you should live your life." From God to us. So you would think that the first rule would be what? What's the worst thing that you could do to somebody? Kill, absolutely. So that's the first one right up top. That's number one. Except that's not the first one. Here's the first rule, the first rule is: "I am the Lord, your God." And I was reading it, and I was, like, "That's a weird rule, man. That's a very weird rule." And plus, everybody already knows that if they're reading the list. It's the only reason they're gonna read the list is that they already agree with number one. No one's just finding it in the woods one day. No one's just walking along, going, like, "What the fuck? "Is that a list? Did you leave a list here? Anybody leave a list here?" And his friend's, like, "What does it say? You read that letter." And you're like, "I don't know. It's probably some fucking Letterman wannabe. Let's get the fuck out of here." And it's like, "Well, what if it's important?" And you're like, "Why would it be important "in the middle of no-- fine, fine, fine. "Let's compromise. I'll read the first one. "And if that's important enough, then we can read the other nine. "That's the only way. No way. "What a fucking waste of time. Hold on. "Number one. "Oh, fuck, it's God. I was way wrong. "I was way wrong. This is the most important list "that's ever been discovered, actually. "Call everybody you know. "Call a bunch of newspapers. "Get 'em over here right now. God wrote this." So fine, whatever. Maybe in case the shit was lost somewhere and somebody found it. That's why it was at the top. But the second rule should be: "Don't kill anybody." But that's not the second rule either. The second rule is: "There are no other gods except for me. And the third rule is: "Don't even carve a tree to look like another god, 'cause there's totally no other gods." But at that point, I was, like, "Dude, it sounds like a bunch of other gods that you don't want us to know about." Being kind of obvious about the whole situation. We're, like, halfway into the list. People are shooting each other in the face, and you're worrying about your reputation? Like, quit being so needy, bro. Why is your shit even in there? If you have to--if you have to, save it for the end. I have, like, top seven, and then eight, nine, ten should be, like, "By the way, a little about the author." You know, that's when you have your Twitter, and your email, and stuff. They didn't even get to it after that. Then they have, like, "Don't talk shit about me. Don't take your name in vain." But that's what they're saying. And then, "Give it up for me one day a week." Like, relax, bro. And then, "Give it up for your mom and dad," and then, "Don't murder." No, the whole list is out. There's some double-ups too. There's some that don't even need to be there. They have, "Don't covet your neighbor's wife." But they also have, "Do not commit adultery." But, how are you supposed to fuck her if you don't covet her? It's two for one. She'd have to be so ugly... to be able to covet that-- to fuck somebody without coveting them. She'd have to be a one. A one. And not even the kind of one you would joke about in high school. Like, "Ha-ha. Look at Mrs. Whitwell. She's a one." She's a four, and we all knew it. I mean a one. I mean, like, "Look, I'm not "attracted to you at all. "This--this quarter of a chubby you feel inside you? "That's the result of seven Viagras. "I just--I don't covet my neighbor's wife. "That's just how I live. "I don't covet my neighbor's wife. "What? Oh, yeah, I'm an adulterer. "Absolutely I do that. "I love doing that. "Your husband borrowed my lawnmower a few months ago "and hasn't returned it, "so I thought I would send him a message. "And now that we're here, I realize this is way too strong "of a message to be sending. So, good-bye." It'd be a great way to stop sex. "Good-bye." That'd be baller. By the way, coveting is such a hard-- you can't even help that. It's not like stealing or murder or anything. You just do it. As soon as you do it, it happens. You can't decide. You see somebody, like, covet-- I covet you. Covet. Covet. Covet. Covet. Covet. Covet again. Covet again. It just happens like that. Covet again. Covet. Covet. I'm not gay, but I've coveted dudes before. As you're, like, whipping by, like, "You--you have long hair." So it's, like, "Do I covet? "Oh, no, fuck. It's too late. Too late. Too late. The covet was there." I've coveted so many transsexuals on fucking Santa Monica Boulevard driving in from behind them. And we're, like, "Oh, yeah, who's this little-- oh, motherfucker! God damn it!" Too late. Covet. Total covet move. I just got my--I'm done with the Ten Commandments now, so... Change your minds, I guess. I just went to my--my-- what's it called? What's--orthodontist for eyeballs? - Optometrist. - Optometrist, thank you. Come on, marijuana. Give me some words back. They say pot has no negative side effects, but I'm, like, "Really? I can't spell effects anymore. I'm sure you're right." I spent a week in February trying to remember what the word for grapefruit was. Like, a full week, I was actually trying to remember it. How do you find that out without carrying a grapefruit with you. I'm going, "What's this?" How do you find out what the word for grapefruit is? Or just go to my friends, I'd be, like, "Hey, what's that-- "what's that shitty orange? It's like a big shitty orange. What is that?" My one friend was like, "Is it a pomelo? Stop shopping at Whole Foods. You're getting weird." Yeah, I went to my--my-- what did you say? Optometrist, yeah. And when did they all turn into fucking salesmen? They're not doctors anymore. They all try to upsell you on Lasik eye surgery. When did doctors stop being doctors? Just do your fucking job, man. Don't try to get more money out of me. Yeah, but they try. Like, at first, the guy was, like, "Do you want--" I don't even mind offering once. When he's, like, "Do you want to get Lasik surgery?" I was, like, "No, that's okay. I don't want it. But then he keeps pushing it. It was, like, "You know the whole procedure takes seven seconds. It's just lasers. Seven seconds, you'll be done." I was, like, "Dude, I have ten minutes. That's not the issue." It was, "I don't want to do it." But he kept trying. He was, like, "You know, it's way safer than not having it done." He's making shit up. You can't make shit up. You're not allowed to do that. Everybody just makes shit up. Like those girls in the mall that sell the hand cream from the Dead Sea. You know? By the way, I've tried it. I haven't used-- I haven't bought it, but I used it. It makes your hands so soft. Like, it definitely works. Masturbation after that was, like, oh. It was like fucking a cloud. And by the way, I've been all over the country, those Israeli girls selling hand cream, they're all over the country. And the world. They're definitely spies. You should watch out for them. But they were, like, "Hey, you should buy this." I was, like, "No, that's okay." And they're, like, "It's got vitamins and minerals from the Dead Sea. And I was, like, "It's got-- it's got vitamins?" And she goes, "Well, minerals." It's not the same thing, then. You can't just make shit up. And getting Lasik eye surgery is not safer than not getting Lasik eye surgery. How--how is it safer? How is it safer than this? When nothing can get in there? How is it possible safer than that? Impenetrable. I can lean back and watch the rain. You should all do that, by the way. Get high in the summertime. Get high and just lean back and watch the rain. It's so much fun. You'll trail, like, one drop all the way down. It's so scary. You'll be, like, "Oh! [indistinct] Wow! Wow!" I don't know how-- how do you guys feel about the government right now? [audience boos] Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's gotten more and more of that. It's weird what--a relationship will happen when you lie 30 straight years. It's weird how it strains a relationship. That and shooting unarmed people. Really get a weird taste in people's mouths. We lie too much. Remember when they--they're spying on everybody, and we're like, "Can you not spy on everybody?" And they're like, "We're not spying on anybody." And we're like, "What about this piece of paper that shows how you're spying on everybody?" And they're like, "Oh. Fine. You happy now?" "No, I'm not happy at all. Just stop doing it." "We'll talk about it later." Fuck the government. Any time I feel the thumb of the government on me, like, any sort of slight impression, I'm like, "Get--get off." I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. I'm from the Don't-Touch-Me Party. Get-Off-Me Party, you know? Yeah, well it's, like, "I'm going over here. Unless I'm doing something wrong, get the fuck off me. You're not supposed to touch me." I do it all-- Any time I feel them, Any time I feel the government. Like, if I'm flying, the TSA-- Oh, I hate the TSA so much. God, I fuck with them hard. I don't know if you guys know this: You don't have to listen to them. If you're fly-- they don't have any real authority. They're less trained than a Starbucks employee. Like, as long as you don't use the word "bomb," or the word "terrorist," you can just fuck with them, and there's nothing they can do. It makes it a lot more fun. Like, if they're patting me down, if they're at my knee or above, if they're ever at my knee or above, I'm always, always just pushing my dick right into their hand, and just taunting them, like, "You love it. "You love for my dick. "Yeah, touch that d! "Oh, well, fuck, then. We'll do this on my terms, not yours." They're the priest of the sky. You don't have to listen to them. God, they're fucking awful. My friends, like, "You know, they're just trying. They're doing their best. You know, they're catching terrorists. They're not. They've never caught a terrorist. In 13 years, they've never caught anyone ever even trying to do anything. They've let two people go. That's their record. The shoe guy and the underwear guy. It's over two. That's their entire record in 13 years. I'm, like, "You're not even doing anything. So what are you doing? All they do is steal iPads all day long. That's how they get a living. They steal iPads. And don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm any better than them. Like, if I was a TSA agent, I'd guarantee you I'd steal all of your iPads. I would never see an iPad I wouldn't steal. I'd do it right in front of you. I'd just be, like, "Fuck yeah, iPad! Whoo!" I would steal thousands of them, you guys. I wouldn't even sell them or use them. I would just hoard them in my apartment. Just piles and piles of iPads. Every night I would lay on top of them and pretend like I was a dragon. That's my right as a TSA officer. Of course I would steal if I was in the TSA. I'm just saying people like me shouldn't be in charge of people like us. Should have better people. I've stolen from every job I've ever had. I've not only done this. I've done, like, nine other things before. I've stolen cash money from every single one of those jobs, including when I worked here at The Comedy Store. That's not above it either. Don't tell the owner, all right, guys? I had a one day job once I stole money from. It was only supposed to last for one day. Inside that day, I managed to locate money, and steal it. I was working--my aunt was a party planner in Washington, D.C. So she got me this job working an inauguration ball for the new mayor. You guys remember Marion Barry? man: Yeah. Ari: If you guys don't remember, Marion Barry was the Mayor of Washington, D.C. for, like, a long time, for, like, a decade or something. Most powerful city in the world politically. And then one day he got caught on camera smoking crack with a prostitute. You know, weekday shit. And they put him in jail. His big quote was, like, "Bitch set me up. Bitch." Me and my friends said that every day for, like, six years after that. "Bitch set me up." So much fun to say. But she didn't set you up, man. I mean, you hired a prostitute to do crack with. How did she set you up? But anyway, he went to jail for, like, seven, eight, ten years. And then when he got out, the prison was like, "All right, you got to find a job now." And he goes, "What should I do?" And they were, like, "What'd you do before?" He goes, "Well, before, I was the Mayor of Washington, D.C." And the warden was like, "Yeah, whatever. Do that. I don't care." And he ran for mayor again, and he won. He won easily. Like, it wasn't even that close. He got, like, 80% of the vote. The people of D.C. were like, "Hey, man. "It was just a little bit of crack. "You were great at balancing the budget. "We don't care... "if you have more time to concentrate on it "because you were up all night doing crack. Either way, welcome home." So I served drinks at this inauguration ball, and there was this giant jar that had people put money into it, like, donations and stuff for the campaign. At the end of the night, they're, like, "Okay, you can stop serving drinks. Go up to this room that people had hung out there a little bit." And they're, like, "Go up there, and count the money, and let us know how much there is in there." So, yeah, for anyone who missed that opportunity, let me just, uh, slow it down for you. "You said, 'Count the uncounted money, "'and tell us how much uncounted money there is in the pile of uncounted money.'" Spoiler alert: It did not all get counted. Of course I would steal if I was in the TSA, fuck them. Resist them whenever you can, guys. Every time you feel like it, just like, "Ah! Get off me." I never take my shoes off anymore. When I'm flying, I just don't do it. You know you're supposed to, but I just don't. I go through security, they're, like, "Sir, your shoes. You have to take your shoes off." I'm, like, "Oh, I can't take them off." They're, like, "What? Why not?" I just go, "Medical condition." It's like diplomatic immunity. They can't say shit after that. The most they can do is ask you what your condition is. And my friend Brent Weinbach taught me this: you just make up some Latin-sounding syllables. It always sounds like a really deadly disease. She go, "What's wrong?" "Oh, mytosis filibopsis." That sounds real as fuck. And it's super rare. You can't even Google it. That's how rare it is. I've had guys apologize, like, "Oh, yeah, I know how that can be." "Do you?" Fuck them. Fuck them. I farted on one of them in Boston. I farted right on him. It was so rewarding, you guys. It was so rewarding. It was my best fart since-- do you remember when you discovered crop-dusting? You know? I don't know if girls got-- little boys are very inquisitive about the world, and they make these observations. And one of the first observations they make is, like, "Oh. Farts smell." And then after a while, you're like, "Wait. "But they don't smell right away. It takes, like, seven or eight seconds for them to smell." I'm like, "What happens to them, then? Do they go train and then come back?" And then you realize, like, "Oh, no. "It's just got to work its way out of your pants for a little while. Just takes about seven seconds." But then you realize, like, "Oh. That means if I fart "quietly enough, and there's a good enough friend, like, right nearby me, you can have a lot of fun with it." If you're, like, [blows] and go, "Hey, man. How are you doing?" And then you just wait. And they'll be like, "What are you doing? "Why are you walking so close to me? "Oh, fuck! Fuck! No! No! No!" Since then, I have never had as rewarding a fart as when I farted on this TSA agent. I was going through, and the first person was like, "Sir, your shoes." I'm like, "Medical condition." And then the second person was like, "Sir, your shoes." I'm like, "Medical condition! Don't you communicate?" And then he goes, "I don't understand. You can get your shoes on, but you can't take them off?" Yeah, excellent question. That's an excellent question. If I really had a disease, I would have an answer for that question. But the only thing I was suffering from was freedom. So he asked me that, I go, "How about this? "How about you just do your fucking job for once and shut your fucking mouth?" Zero respect, whatsoever. I'm telling you, you guys, Fuck them. And some of my friends are like, "They're just doing their job." Like, don't take that job. You can get a job in the mafia, doesn't mean you're supposed to do it. My father was a Holocaust survivor, and he always taught us that just doing our job is not really an excuse for your actions. Too far, right? That's too far. I agree with you. I agree with you. That was too much of a comparison. So he goes, "Okay, I'm going to search your bag again." And he starts to unzip my bag, and I just took my hand, and I slammed it right on there. I'm, like, "No, no, no. You don't get to search me again "'cause I don't like you. That's not the rule. "I don't have to like you. And, just to be clear, I do not like you." I'm telling you, black people, if you ever want to yell at a cop, this feels just as good. There's no repercussions. So immediately he calls his supervisor over. He's just, like, "Supervisor." And look, here's the deal. I've had, like, 40 supervisors called on me at this point, I'm a complete cunt when I fly. He did not--it takes, like, an extra 40 minutes every single time. You don't want to go-- My friends all know. My friends, like, "I'll see you up there at Pizzeria Uno." I'm, like, "All right. I'll catch up with you. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! I got work to do. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Here's the deal about supervisors: They always think you're gonna be more scared of them because their walkie-talkie is up here instead of down there. And they think that's their special X-Men power. So this guy was, like, you know, the regular guy was, like, "Supervisor." And I immediately I was like, [mocking] "Supervisor. Supervisor. Supervisor." Fucking rat bitch. You gonna tell on me? [mocking] "Supervisor. Call your mommy." Supervisor comes in eventually, and he's, like, "Yeah, is there something I can help you with?" I was, like, "Yeah, we're trying to figure out "how many idiots this is going to take. So far, we're up to two." And he was, like, "What's the problem?" And that one guy starts to talk. I'm, like, "I'll talk 'cause you're an idiot. "He's searching me again 'cause I don't like him, "and that's not the deal. I didn't do anything. "You're not supposed to search me. "That's the deal we made. I'm an American. I'm white, and you leave me alone." So he was, like--he saw that I was just trouble, so he was, like--he was, like, "Sir, if you don't like the rules, don't fly." Which is very dismissive. I'm not the enemy. I'm just some fucking guy who wants to fly. But the cool thing was, I'd heard that logic before, so I was kind of ready for it. So he goes, "If you don't like the rules, don't fly." And I go, "Isn't that what they told Rosa Parks?" And he was, like--he goes, "That's different." And I go, "Shut up, racist!" It's so much fun to fuck with them. You guys know who Rosa Parks was? [voices of approval] All right. Hopefully you all do. You should all know. So I told--all right, I'll just tell you. Rosa Parks-- You should know this. You should read something. Rosa Parks is a really influential figure in the Civil Rights Movement. She would--she took slaves by way of Underground Railroad over the border into Canada. It's embarrassing, you guys. You guys should really read something. It's embarrassing. Yes, that was the other one. Whoever said that. That's true. Was the other one. [mockingly] That was the other one. So the supervisor guy, he was just done. He was like, "Sir, you have to listen to me." And right when he said the H in "have to," I got this gurgling in my stomach from last night's Chipotle. It was like... [gurgling] Hey, look, here's the deal. I don't believe in God, okay? I just don't. But us atheists, every once in a while, we get these gifts. And they kind of make us wonder. Like, in this case, like, who else but Jesus would have known that I wanted to fart so badly right now? No one. Who else had the power to grant me that wish? Nobody but Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Is that how you say it? I really have no idea. Whenever I say that, I feel like everybody can see through it. Like a clearly in-the-closet gay guy who's taking about women. And they're like, "I love pussy, you guys." "I don't think you do." "What do you mean? I love it! It's my favorite thing." "Yeah, you keep saying that, but I don't believe you." So then he goes, "Sir, you have to listen to me." And I go, "You have to smell my fart." And I just cut the longest, loudest fart. It was, like, 14 seconds long... and so loud, cartoonishly loud. People from other aisles were turning around just going like, "Did someone sneak in a lawnmower? What's happening?" One fart the whole way through. I was careful not to chop it up at all, 'cause I didn't want them thinking, like, "Oh. Some of these farts are from other people." No, one fart all for you. But I didn't want it to come out too fast either, 'cause if it came out wet, then he would win. You really got to finesse it in these high-pressure situations. And we're like... [imitates farting] And that pitch, that's how long it was. It went down and then back up in bass. It was like... [imitates farting] the whole time looking at them right in the eyes. [imitates farting] Just didgeridoo noise fucking being thrown at them. [imitates farting] And he had zero emotion on his face the entire time. Just like this. And then when I'm done, when I finish it off, he just goes, "Really?" I'm like, "Yeah, man, really. We're getting sick of you. We don't want you here anymore." "Bob Dob, lock the cockpit gate--door." That's it. Metal detector, that's all you need. Yeah. Here's what I want to do from now on. This might go too far. This is what I want to do. I want to take out my cell phone camera when I'm at the airport. Every TSA agent I pass, I'm gonna, like, really obviously take a picture of them. Like, really obvious, you know? I'll leave my flash on, like, I'm not trying to hide it. And if they stop me, if they go, "Sir, what are you doing?" I'm gonna go, "When the revolution comes, we're going to want to know who's side you were on." I'm telling you guys, try it. Try it. Try to resist them in some small way. Just try to be, like, "No, get the fuck off me." Just curse 'em out, or don't do that thing where it looks like you're being sent off to a concentration camp, getting arrested. Or just don't take your shoes off. Just try that. You'll be nervous at first. I was too. When I first did it, I was so nervous. You'll be nervous too, but when you get through with it, you'll feel like George Washington. You guys, that's my special. Thank you very much, everybody. You guys are cool. [cheers and applause] Thank you. All right, all right. Thank you very much. [Geraldo Azevedo & Alceu Valenca's Mister Mist√©rio] *
