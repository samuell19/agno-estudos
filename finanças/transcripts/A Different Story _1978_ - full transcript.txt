(airplane roaring) (dramatic classical music) (all clapping) (brakes screech) - Sorry I'm late. Hi, Douglas. Well, sir, you've set the record this trip. You're off the plane at five, you call me by six and you expect to rent a castle by noon the next day. - [Douglas] No, doesn't do anything for me. - Hello, Jeffrey. - I had to let Jeffrey go. Albert, meet Stella Cooke. - Albert. - This one I like. How much? - I never would have taken you for Tudor, Douglas. (classical music) - Why don't you clear up some of this mess from last night at least? - Yes, sir. Immediately, sir. You ready for your rub? Hmm? (glass clinks) - Do you want some help? - Sorry, no, no. (glasses clinking) Your rub. (gentle classical music) Hold that. (classical music) - Congratulations on your house, Douglas. - Congratulations on your 3250. - I'm sure you're gonna have a great season. - Ah, here! - It's on its way to gold. - Oh! Fantastic. Thank you. Huh. That's a great picture of you. - Thank you. - You and Albert, I'm sure, are going to enjoy your stay. - Oh, er, Albert's not with me anymore. Justin, meet Stella Cooke. - Hello. - Hello. Justin? Justin. (car door bangs shut) (motor revs) Ciao! With a guest apartment above. Here we are, your formal entry. One of the nicest features of this house is the hardwood paneling that runs... Oh, I guess they turned off the electricity. Anyway, the hardwood paneling runs throughout the house. There's oak in the living room. This right here is pine. It's really a very nice feature. There's lots of closet space in here. And uh, there's the wall to wall carpeting and... (water running) - Someone's living here. - Oh, no. No, there really shouldn't be. Um... It's coming from the bathroom. - It's stopped. - Why don't you just wait right here and I'll go check this out, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. - Come on, Teddy, let's get out of here. I don't like hardwood paneling anyway. - Hello? (knocks on door) Hello in the bathroom. I'm an agent with Bev-Air Properties. I was, uh, gonna show the house. I didn't realize that there was gonna be somebody here. (knocks on door) Hello? (clears throat) (door bangs shut) Hey! Hey! Wait a minute, who are you? - What? - What are you doing? - It's Albert! I didn't have any place else to go. - Albert. Oh, my God, what's the matter with you? You're foaming at the mouth. - Nothing, I was brushing my teeth. Can you get off me, please? - Albert, you don't belong here. (water running) I really am sorry you can't stay. - I'll get by. - Don't you have any friends in L.A.? - I'll get by. -$12.42. I'm gonna put this money in your pocket. Is that all you have? - Mm-hmm. - I can't believe that Sills would just let you go like this. - Well, I'll report him to the union. - Hey, Albert, if you want to you can spend the night at my house tonight. What do you say? You don't have to worry. - About what? - I'm not gonna touch you. I'm just a nice person. Mm! Well, it's not the Hills. But then again, I'm not Sills. (chuckles) (Stella laughing) Oh. Oh, would you get the door? Hit Chuck! (laughs) Meet Albert. Albert, Chuck. He's not really mine. He's an independent. No, don't close the door. He's claustrophobic. He'll show himself out when he's finished. (Stella clears throat) So what's next? - What do you mean? - I'm just trying to make conversation, Albert. - You sound like a social worker. - Well, you know, you're not much of a talker. - All right. Yes, I have. Several and not particularly. - What? - Have you ever been with a woman? How many? And did you like it? - Do you mind if I ask my own questions? - Why, did I skip some? - No. I think that about covered it. Thank you. - I'll get a job, probably. - [Stella] What? - I said I'd get a job, probably. Some man who can afford it. -Hmm. Did you say something? - I said that I'd get a job. - Oh. Mm-hmm. Okay. This is the other bedroom. Uh, it's a mess. You could wade through and sleep on the bed or uh, you can crash on the couch. - The sofa's fine. (Stella speaks foreign language) - Why do you keep calling me Albert? (Stella laughs) - Because you're French, right? Huh? - Very good. - Ah. - Yeah. Belgian. - Uh-huh. - How did you know that? - 'Cause you sort of speak through your nose a little bit. But you don't have an accent, how come? - Because I don't want one. - Right. (Chuck yowling) Chuck! Chuck! Chuck is the Casanova of this neighborhood. (laughs) Goodnight. Oh, I forgot. That's the toilette. (door thuds shut) - [TV Announcer] Is Williamson. There'll be no icing call because they had a chance to play the puck. And it goes to Nelson, he dumps it in. Garceau coming out of his... (dish clatters) That's young Mr. Nelson, number 32. The young man scored four points in his league debut. -18. - [TV Announcer] Right out front Garceau goes to... -19. - [TV Announcer] As Allen tried to change he direction... - 20. - [TV Announcer] A check over there thrown on Jones by Nelson, this puck picked up behind by Jackson. Land goes down, held at the point by Porter. The shot goes high. Nearsight has taken over here. Backhanded into the zone by Berger. Alan carries up, Alan being trailed. Alan starts. Alan taken off with a loose puck and then to be cleared off the zone by Berger. Porter comes back to get it. Porter now challenges. Almost got it right on the stick to Jones. (crowd cheering) Coming back. He goes to the right side to Porter. Porter, Porter, his shot goes wide! Comes all the way back out to neutral ice. Nelson waits there...

I produce television commercials. My name's Roger Stock. - Nice to meet you. (bright music) - My uh, hotel isn't far. Maybe you'd like to come over and have a drink with me. We could talk about not being from L.A. (laughs) - Maybe you could give me your phone number and I could call you. Okay? I don't, my phone's not hooked up yet, so. But not tonight. - Sure, yeah. I'm at the Sunset Plaza. I have 10 be in I A. every other month for work, you know. Well, maybe we'll talk again sometime. Oh! Hope the water's cooled off by now. (bright music) - [Stella] What kind of wine do you want? - [Chris] Red wine. - [Stella] You do? - [Chris] Yeah. - [Stella] Okay. I'll get you some red wine. - [Chris] Okay. - [Stella] This way. - [Chris] Oh. It's dark. - [Stella] There's a light by the door. Front door on the wall. - All right. Stella, it's um, your friend. - [Stella] Albert. - Uh, well, things didn't work out and you said that I could stay. Never mind, I'll get out of here. - (laughs) No, it's all right. - No, no, no, I'll get out of here. - No. - I'm sorry. - No, pour Albert a glass of wine, Chris. - I'm doing it. - How did you get into my house? - Uh... - Huh?

I'm staying on the sofa. - Where's Stella? - She's... She's... - Oh, my God. - [Albert] Who are you? - Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I knew it! - [Stella] Phyllis... - [Phyllis] I knew it! - [Stella] Phyllis, wait a minute. - Oh, my God! Oh, my... - [Stella] Phyllis! Phyll, Phyllis! (door bangs shut) Phyllis. - Oh, my God! - [Stella] Put down the pots! (crockery clattering) Goddammit, Phyllis, not the toaster! - Would you just tell Stella that I'll uh, I'll call her later. Bye, Al. - What? Bye. - [Stella] Let's talk, come on. - I don't want to talk! Talking doesn't do anything. Who is he? - He's nobody. (Phyllis crying) Phyll. Phyll. We've got to stop doing this to each other. How'd you find out? Huh? - Gayle saw you. - Didn't we decide that we were gonna see other people if we wanted to? - Yes. - We did. - Yes. - We decided that. - Mm-hmm. (Phyllis crying) - Excuse me. - Who are you calling? - I'm calling Dr. Saunderheim. - No, I don't want to talk to him. - Phyllis, you're not talking to me. - My session's tomorrow, I'll talk to him then, okay? - Okay. (gentle music) Look at me. Look at me. Everything's gonna be all right. (Phyllis sobs) You're very important to me. And it's gonna be okay. - Oh, Stella, I'm sorry. - I know. (Phyllis sobs) So, who came before Sills, hmm? - Well, who came before Phyllis? Herbert Comstock. Before Sills was Herbert Comstock. - The writer? - Yeah. I designed two book jackets for him. Then Carlo Juan Francisco Montoya. - [Stella] Ah! And who is that? - The Brazilian tin king. - Oh. - Did you know that 30% of the tin cans in the world are Carlo's, hmm? Did you know that? That's where I met Sills, actually. Sills was invited by Carlo to one of his big yearly events and Carlo insisted that I design this spectacular centerpiece, so I made his family crest with 400 tin cans. (laughs) Everybody loved it. When he left, Sills suggested that I give up the old tin kingdom and put a little music in my life. Sills is actually really an incredible man when he opens up and you get to know him. - So what are you gonna do when you grow up? - Listen, you brought it up. (Stella laughs) - Hi. God, what a day. Where'd you find that? - Underneath some stuff in the spare room. - (laughs) I forgot about that old thing. You know how to fix sewing machines, too, huh? Albert, my mother should have had you. She always wanted me to cook and clean and do all that kind of stuff. Rooker. Rooker, Rooker, Rooker, Rooker, Rooker. Rooker, Rooker, Rooker. So I told her, I said, "Mom," I said, "Ma, the only mistake you made" "was making me a person instead of a girl." - Mm-hmm. - Something smells real good. I'm hungry. (dish clatters) You okay, Albert? - [Albert] Mm-hmm. - What's bothering you, huh? - Nothing. Just that you could have let me know that you'd be late. - I'm sorry. I was showing a house. - Well, there's such a thing as a phone. - There wasn't a phone. - Mm-hmm. - It was an empty house. I said I'm sorry. I can't plan my life around your meals. I can't. - Mm-hmm. - If I hear one more mm-hmm. Please. - My Swedish meatballs are all dried up. My beans are shriveled. (Stella laughs) - Well, I'm not gonna say I'm sorry again. Nobody asked you to stay and if you don't like it, you can always leave. Who needs this? (car horn honking outside) Albert? Why doesn't Roger come in? I wonder why he never comes in. I mean, you've known him for three weeks. He never comes in. It'd be nice, you know? Well, maybe he's shy. (doorbell chimes) - [Albert] Hi, Rog. - Oh, um, am I interrupting something? - Oh, no, no, no, no. Stella just wanted to check you out, that's all. - Oh. Hello. - Hi. - Goodbye. - Oh, well. - Check it out. - Huh? - Check it out. See if it's like, you know... - All right, but do you think it's right? Do you think salmon... Albert said the shirt should be salmon colored and it looks very pink. - This is deeply salmon. - It is? - Yes. Can you have dinner tonight? - Chinese. - No, Mexican. Please, just once. - Oh, but Phyll, I don't... - Phyllis. - What? - I don't think I should tonight. - Why not? - Because Albert didn't come home last night and I think he's probably making up one of his great big surprises or something, so... Let me call you, okay? - Sounds serious, you two. - Yeah. (Phyllis laughs and clucks tongue) - Yeah. - Bye-bye. - Albert? Albert. (light clicks on) (telephone ringing) Hello, Albert? Oh! Hello, Mrs. Franklin. No, I'm sorry, that house has been sold. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Look, though, call me tomorrow at 10. I've got another house and, uh, it's in the same price range. That's right. I'm sure you're gonna love it, it's really perfect. All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Yeah, bye-bye. (rotary phone dialing) Hello, Roger? Albert told me that you lived at the Sunset Plaza and uh... Oh! Oh, excuse me, this is Stella Cooke. Yeah. By any chance is he there? Oh, I see. I'm sorry that I bothered you. Yeah. Bye. - [Man On TV] Jack! Jack! (thrilling music on TV) (door rattling) (door thuds shut) - Hello. - Hi Hey, Albert? You hungry? - What? No. I've had dinner, thank you. - It's really very good, you know. You want a bite? - No. Thank you, I'm sure it's terrific. (dishes clinking) (funky music) (telephone ringing) Hello, Stella Cooke's house. Can I take a message? - [Woman] Uh, this is her mother. Who's this? - This is... Her answering service. - [Mrs. Cooke] I didn't know she had an answering service. - Well, it's new, so she's trying it out. - [Mrs. Cooke] Well, tell my daughter that we're on our way and we'll be there in about an hour. - That's too soon! - [Mrs. Cooke] Too soon? - I must be confusing one of her other messages. (funky music) Oh, God. (rotary phone dialing) (men speaking foreign language) (telephone ringing) - Stella Cooke. Albert, not now, I'm on a... What? Oh my God, Albert, that's too soon. (men speaking foreign language) Albert, let's just forget about the whole thing. Let's take them out to dinner. (men speaking foreign language) Al right. All right, I'll buy some. I'm on my way home. (men speaking foreign language) Sam. Sam, you handle this for me, hmm? (men bickering in foreign language) You can do it, Sam. Handle the whole thing for me. (men speaking in foreign language) Albert? Albert. Albert? Chuck, in, out. Whatever, I don't have time. Albert! - Here I am. - Yeah. - Here I am. Now, look, I've written down all the instructions. - Yeah. - Here they are. - Okay. - Okay? Just follow them. - Add half an egg and butter mixture, you cook the yolks... (Stella reading quietly) Albert, I don't understand any of this. Albert, this is all French. Albert, I don't understand anything of this. - Okay, look... - Mix with sweet basil... - Just pay attention. Pay attention. - To a butter mixture. - I'm turning this two quart pan to medium heat, right? - [Stella] Uh-huh, okay. - [Albert] Now, when the lid starts to flutter... - What's a flutter? - You just turn it to low. A flutter? - Yeah. - Aflutter is a flutter, - like that. - Uh-huh. - And that timer is for that pot. This timer is for this pot. - This timer's for this pot. - When you hear them go off, listen. - Yeah? - When you hear them go off... (timer dings) - Right, I'm setting it back. - Right, right. - You just turn it off. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, that's okay. So what's in this pot, hmm? - Never mind, just follow the instructions. - What am I cooking? - Don't worry about it. - Albert, what am I cooking? - Just follow the instructions, okay? - Right. (doorbell chimes) Ah! - Jesus. - It's them, Albert, they're here. - Okay, okay. - Okay. - How do I look? - I have an egg, but... - Hmm? How do I look? - You look cute. - Okay. Here. Here, here, here. Here, here, here, here. (doorbell chimes) - I'm coming! - Here, here. - Be right there! - There. - Okay. - Give me your coat. - Coat. Coming! Okay. - Geez, this is nice. I'm gonna wear this. All right, I'll be back in 20 minutes. Good luck. (laughs) Chuck! Come on, Chucky. - [Stella] Mom, come on, Mom, I know what I'm doing, really. - What'd you think of the Dodgers game? - What game are you talking about? Season's been over for almost a month. - The last one. - The last one? - Messersmith can really get 'em in there, huh? - [Mr. Cooke] I don't think Messersmith pitched in that last game. - Yeah, I know. It's too bad, 'cause he can really get 'em in there. - [Stella] No Mom, there's nothing going out of order. That timer looks about right. - [Mrs. Cooke] It's done? - [Stella] When it dings. - Excuse me, I'm just, I'm gonna get a glass of water. - Go on, sit down, Al Mother! Bring a glass of water for Al. - No, I can... - And a beer for me! - I can get it. - No, come on, come on, sit down. She'll get it. - Here you are. - Thank you. - There you are, dear. - Thank you. - I'll take this one back. - I'll just get another one, thank you. Excuse me. - It's burnt to shit. - All right. All right, the rice is gone. Um, no, Stella, this is not supposed to boil. - Oh. - Wrong. Let's see there's no time for noodles. But that's all right, there's plenty without it. So in five minutes I just want to- Why did you turn this off? - [Stella] It dinged. - What dinged? - The timer. - Fuck the timer, did it flutter? Look, I've turned it up to high, right? - Yeah. - So when it begins to flutter, turn it to low. Low, right? Okay, you're doing fine. Really, you're doing very well. They're going to love it. (all laughing) - You know, I can't believe this. (Albert laughing) If I didn't see this with my own eyes! You know, she couldn't boil water a year ago. (telephone rings) - It's true. - Excuse me. - I'll bet Albert had something to do with all this. - Hello. Hi. Yeah. Just a minute. It's for you. - Me? - Mm-hmm. Is everything all right? - Oh, yeah, fine. - Delicious. - Can I get you anything else? - No, no, no, no, no. - You sure? - The cake is great. - Hello? - I'm glad you like it. - You make it? (Stella laughs) Huh? - I can't lie, Pop, I didn't, but I did defrost it. (Mrs. Cooke laughs) - Listen, that's something. You defrosted it very nicely. - What do you want, Douglas? - Oh, please, don't be unfriendly. I'm having warm little thoughts about you this evening. - [Albert] Listen, Douglas, I really... - Let's not talk like this. I got a new case of your favorite Cabernet Sauvignon. Why don't you come over and share some with me? - I wouldn't waste the time or the wine. - I miss you. I do. Can I expect you before 10? I'll open the Cabernet so it can breathe. - [Mr. Cooke] Remember when you were a little girl? - Look, Douglas, I'm not coming over tonight or ever again. And you just gotta get used to that idea. - Albert, please. Albie. I know you don't want any trouble. Neither do I. So be a good boy and see that there won't be any. - Why don't you just go play with your baton instead? - By 10, Albie! (slams receiver) (line beeping) - [Stella] Thank you for it. - [Mr. Cooke] Oh, you're welcome. - [Mrs. Cooke] Ooh! - [Stella] Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right. (laughs) - Watch yourself there. - You were a pretty bad cook, honestly. You've come a long way. - Oh, it's all been just delicious. - [Mr. Cooke] Yeah. - It really has. You know, that's the best beef stew that I have ever had. - Thank you very much. (Stella laughing) - Come on, now, say goodnight. - Oh, ouch! (laughs) - [Mr. Cooke] Oh, I'm sorry. Come on, let's not take all night. - Okay, goodnight. - Bye-bye. - Goodnight. Drive carefully. Mm-hmm. (both laughing) - You looked right at her and said thank you. (both laughing) You did it. You know what she said to me? - What? - When you were on the phone with Toscanini. - Who? - My mother. - What? - My mother. - Yeah? - She looked right at me and she says, she says, "Stella," she says, "Stella, your man, what a find." (both laugh) So I said, "Mom you should only know!" (both laughing) But she's right. (laughs) You are a find, Albert. That you are. - Well, thank you. (both laugh) I'm glad that you found me. (both laugh) - Well, thank you. I'm glad that you cooked dinner. - Well, thank you. I'm glad that you're gonna clean it up. (both laugh) - No, I'm not! Albert. Give me a break. Mm. You could not tell the difference. (laughing) - Excuse me, miss. Yes, you. Do you live in that house? - Yes. - Do you know an Albert Walreavens? - Why? - Is he staying here? - If he's here, you better tell us. You're harboring an illegal alien. - Oh, you mean a person not of this planet? (laughs) (Phyllis laughing) - Listen, miss, this is a very serious charge. - It sounds very serious and I'm sorry I can't help you, but I, I really don't know this person. - Come on. - I know, I gotta go to a film. Excuse me. (car doors bang shut) (motor revs) Albert, I still don't understand why you're not a legal person. - Because the bastard promised that he'd pay off the immigration authorities. - Who's that, Sills? - No, Harrison. - Harrison. - Yeah, let's try and keep the socks neat on this side. - Who's Harrison? - Harrison is, I told you, he's an American who smuggled me into the country. - Oh. So he's the one that fouled the whole thing up. - Yes. He told me that he liked my designs and that he had friends in the garment industry who would help me and then two weeks after I got to the States, he didn't even know that I existed. - But Albert, that was years ago. Why didn't you do something about getting some kinda legal papers? - Well, I didn't because I didn't. Here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Well. - Try to put them... - You know what I think you should do? You know what I think you should do? - You have to turn the picture upside, like this. - Okay, we'll do it like that. - Good. - You know what I think you should do, Albert? - Uh, can you zip that? -Hmm? - Can you zip that now? - I think you should get yourself a hotel room some place. I think you should sit down and I think that you should... - Wait! This sweater. - Think about this for a while! - This sweater, here. No. I don't want to do that. I've got to leave it. - So where are you gonna go? -Um... New York, I guess. I have friends there, you know. Here, let me pull and then you can... Here, let me do that. - I'll do it. - I'll do it! - I'll do it! (passengers chattering) Want some soup? - No. I don't want any soup. - You sure? - It's chicken. - Mm-hmm. I don't want any. - You okay? - Yeah. - How come you're not talking? - I don't know. - I'll call you when I get there. - [PA Announcer] Attention, please. Will all passengers please have your tickets ready for the Chicago-New York City bus loading at Door 2. Door 2, please. (melancholy music) - This is it. - Let me say goodbye to you here because I don't like to see people ride away. - Okay. - There's your stuff. (melancholy music) Bye. - Bye. - Are you sure you've got enough um... - Yeah. - Yeah, I've got plenty. - Yeah? Okay. - And I'll send it to you as soon as I can. - Sure. You take care. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - I'll write to you, okay? (melancholy music) (dramatic music) - [Man] Or unadvisedly, but discreetly and soberly. Now, are all the witnesses present? - [Stella] Yes. - [Albert] Uh-huh. - All right. Albert Paul Walreaven. - Walreavens. - Walreavens. Uh, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? - I do. - And um, you, Stella Jean Cooke, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? - I do. - Then by the authority vested in me by the State of California, I pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. It's the lady on your left. (both giggle) (upbeat music) - I can't believe they painted just married on the car. - Listen to me. There is an old American custom. Here. And now that you're legal, sir. Oh! (Albert laughs) (both laughing) - Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! All right, my turn. My turn. I played the bride now I get to play the groom. - What? - Here, here. - Huh? Oh!

(both laughing) Get the door. - [Stella] (singing) Get the door! (door bangs shut) Albert, you better stop. (Albert laughs) - Why? - Put me down, you're gonna hurt your back. Your poor back, Albert! I'm heavy, I'm heavy. - I'm fine. Here, get the light. (both laughing) Ah, my back! - Are you all right? (both laughing) - Here, let me take your coat. - Oh, thank you. (laughs) (Chuck yowling nearby) Chuck! - You go, Chucky boy! (gentle music) Goodnight. (gentle music) (Stella speaks foreign language) - Goodnight, Stella. (gentle music) - I should have taken my own car. - Honey, I like to drive you to school. - I know. Listen, I'm sorry, I know how it sounds. I know it's ridiculous. I mean, I know it sounds paranoid, it is. I mean, it's justifiable, all right? - How's here? - This is good. I like to walk, I do. I mean, it's fine. - Yeah. - Listen, those kids, they pick up on everything. I mean, they notice any little thing, do you understand? - Okay, Miss Pearlman, you have a good day. Mwah! - Don't do that. (car door bangs shut) (funky music) - Oh, good morning. Are you the lady of the house? - Why? Oh. He's tied up. Somebody here to see you! Bye-bye. Have a good day. - Yes? Oh! I'm sorry, but we have all the brushes we need, thank you. (motor revving) - It's the usual 2.50, how about the usual three bucks? (telephone rings) - Mm. - Money, yeah. - You gotta get here quicker, it's getting cold. One, two, three. - I'll try. Thanks a lot. Take care, Stella. - Bev-Aire Properties, Stella Cooke.

I want to open my eyes. - Hold your arm up. No, I don't want you to see it till it's done. - My back itches. Who taught you to sew like this? - My father. - Oh, your father? - Close your eyes. Come on. - In Belgium? - Yeah, he was a tailor. - Oh. (laughs) You know, you should do this. You should do this full time. - Uh-huh? - Mm-hmm. Find somebody else to stick. (Albert laughs) (telephone rings) - Oh, saved. - Keep your eyes closed. Come on. Keep your eyes closed. - Oh, Albert, this is ridiculous! - Come on! - Stand still, please. - The phone.

Hi, Phyll. Hi. - Yeah. - Oh, Jesus. - I know, I know I haven't. I've been really busy. Yeah. When? Oh, yeah, let's do that. Let's. Yeah. You know, I... I really can't talk right now. No. I've got my eyes closed, right? (laughs) Albert's pinning this dress on me and it's... Yeah, it's purple. Yeah. No. No, no, no. No, I'm not trying to avoid you. I'm not. I have not seen Chris. Phyll. Phyll, listen to me. No, I'm not... I don't lie to you. I've never lied to you, baby, I... No, I'm telling you I haven't seen her. I really can't talk right now, huh? Al right. We will. I do. Yeah. Okay. All right, bye-bye. - Stella, you've got to tell her. - I will. - You really do. I know why you're not, but it's mean not to. - Albert, I'll tell her. - It really is mean not to do it. - Albert. I'll tell you something. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, it's all messed up. Don't, no, no, I wanted to... - Hold me. Hold me. Hold me. (car door bangs shut) - Phyll, hi. What are you doing here? - Oh, just one of the ladies who lunch. - Ah! - I thought I would treat myself while I grade some papers and Stella told me you're working here, so I thought, - you know. - Yeah. Yeah, well, it's not exactly creative, but, you know, the tips are okay. The food's not bad. But don't eat the catch of the day, 'cause they caught it last month. (Phyllis sobs) Phyll? Are you okay? What's the matter? - I'm sorry, I do that sometimes for no reason. Dr. Saunderheim told me not to try and stop it. Once I did that in the middle of my uh, my third period, so I um... I threw some things down on the floor so I'd have to bend over and pick them up so my class wouldn't see me. I think they knew. I mean, the way they looked at me afterwards. Maybe they didn't know. Maybe I was just imagining. I think they... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm interfering with your parking. I'm sorry. - No, no. It's all right, the lunch rush is over. It doesn't matter. - Well, if I'm bothering you, please just tell me, okay? - No, you're not. Not at all. Let me just pull you over to the side, okay? - Okay. (car door bangs shut) (motor revs) How's Stella? - What? - How's Stella? - Oh. She's fine. - I hardly see her anymore. I think it's good for us, this period. I think we need it. Stella hates it when I cry. I mean for nothing. You know, sometimes I feel like going up to my mother, going right up to her and saying, "Mother, I'm a lesbian." "Now you can put all the pieces together" "that you've been trying to figure out." "See how all the pieces fit now?" She's still trying to find me a nice Jewish boy. (laughs) (Albert laughs) - Well... - Yes, sir! - I think we uh, I think we can work it out once I've pulled myself together, you know? I think we can uh... I think we can try it again. Living together, I mean. (motor revs) - You lived together? - Oh, for about a week and a half. I was so paranoid, so crazed, thinking everybody knew, everybody was talking. (chuckles) Nobody cared. Nobody was talking. What do you think, Albert? - About what? - Well, do you think we'll get back together again? I mean... I mean sometime. - I don't know. - Do you know what I mean? - Well, not really. - You're not involved or anything like that. I just want to know if you think it'll work out. - Well, I can't tell, it's... It's hard for me to say. - You think I'm crazy? - No. - I am handling it, Albert. - You're avoiding it. - I'm not! - That's how you're handling it! I spent 10 minutes parking cars with her and I can tell that you're not handling it. - Lookit, I don't want her to wrap her car around some telephone pole. You don't know Phyllis, she's gonna start popping pills like they're jellybeans. - (sighs) What the hell did I do? Jesus. Look, it's tight in the bust and here. - I think it looks all right. - I don't believe this. - I think it looks really neat. - Here. Take it off, try this on. (door creaks open) What happened? What happened? What did he say? Did he say anything, huh? - I'm pregnant. - God. Just like that? - Three months, three months. - Wow, I can't believe this. I don't believe this. Are you sure? Is he sure, huh? Is he sure? Want a cup of coffee? - No, thank you. - How about a doughnut? - No. - How do you feel? - I don't know how I feel, I don't know. I mean, I never... I never thought of this, you know? I mean, I never... - Me either. - I never, ever thought of it, Albert. - I never really remember ever thinking about this. I mean, I never, ever, ever thought about this. Ever, I... (Stella laughing) What? (both laughing) - I like it, I think I like it. - (laughs) Yeah? - I do, yes. (both laughing) - Wow! (both laughing) I gotta tell... I gotta tell somebody, I want to tell somebody! Hey! - Oh, no, come on! Oh, Albert! - I'm pregnant! I mean, she's pregnant! She's pregnant, she's pregnant! (Albert exclaims) Oh! Cigars! Cigars is what happens now! - Cigars! - What? Oh, no, no, it's too soon, it's too early! - It's too early. - A baby! (gentle music) (vacuum whirring) - Oh! - You gotta go all the way down. -I am. - Yeah? - I'm down there. - Are you all the way down? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. (Albert whistling tune) - Albert, do you have to do that right here, right now? - Okay, no vacuum. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Uh, you hungry? - Mm-hmm, starving. - Great! Lobster bisque. - Oh! - Coming up. - I think I'm gonna call in sick again tomorrow. - Good. I told you, you should forget about working for a while. Anyway, you know, if we need to I can always get a real job job. - Nope. I can't, I got sales pending and I got about eight new listings. - Oh, you can do all that by phone. Don't worry about it. Listen, we'll cut down. You know, you're gonna have to quit pretty soon. - And who's gonna do the housework? Don't even look at me, Albert. - [Albert] Here. - Thank you. - Huh? - Oh, I don't want this. - Oh, come on, it's good. - I don't want it. - Oh, gee. - Thanks anyway. - Okay. - I think I'm gonna make myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole wheat toast with butter. - Oh, great. - Mm. You want one? - No, thank you. (slurps bisque) - Albert, don't eat my lobster soup. - Ooh, you want it? - Here. - No! No, I don't want it now. Maybe with my sandwich, though. - Ugh! God, now I don't want it. (car horn honks nearby) (motorcycle revving) - Phyllis, now listen. Honey. No, there is no blame. No. It's not your fault. If there is any blame, Phyllis, it's mine. - (whispers) Does she know? - Now, calm down, slow down. Slow down. Just take a breath. Yeah. Now, listen, good. Listen to me, okay? Listen. Listen, Phyllis, I want you... I want you to do something for me. I want you to call Dr. Saunderheim as soon as we're through. That's right. Will you do that for me? Huh? Phyllis, will you do that for me? That is just, what are you trying to prove by talking like that? Huh? Phyllis? Phyllis? Oh! - [Albert] Found out? - Yes, she did. (rotary dialing) (knocking on door) Phyllis! (knocks on door) Phyllis, open the door. (pounds door) Phyllis, open the goddamn door! - Shh! - Albert, she's not gonna open it. I know she's not gonna open the door, I know she's not! (pounds door) - What are you doing? - Huh? Please be here. - Yes? - Yes? - Hello. Can we use your apartment, please? - What for? - What for? - To walk through. - What? - What? - Don't you have adjoining balconies? - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - Oh! - Excuse me, sir, this is an emergency, thank you. - Stella— - It's an emergency - in my apartment? - Stella! Don't you go out to that balcony, Stella. - Hey! - No, no, it's all right, I'm with her. - Oh, what's going on? - Well, it's just, it's a suicide. We'll explain later, okay? - Oh, my God, stop her. - Oh, no, no, no, not her! Her. Stella! - Stella! - Albert, Albert! - Albert, Albert! - Let me do it. Let me do it. - No, Albert, I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing! I'm being careful. - Turn around, at least. - Don't do that, please! Be careful, be careful. - Careful, careful! - Shh! - Oh, my God, no, please, please. Ah! Watch it, watch it. - [Stella] Help me push it. (door squeaks open) Phyllis. She's in the bathroom. - [Albert] Yeah? - Phyllis, are you okay? Open the door. All right, Phyllis. I'm gonna get on the phone right now and I'm gonna call the police. I mean it. The police. The fire department. And your mother. (door clicks open) - Oh, Jesus. - Where'd you get that? - Jesus Christ. - Phyllis. Please don't play with it. Is that loaded? - You brought him here. - Well, no, not really. Actually, I came along by myself. Listen, you two just want to be together, I'll just, I can go. - It's a toy, Phyllis. - Is it a toy? (gun clicks) - Let's find out. - [Albert] It's not a toy. - Yes, it is. - Phyllis, don't pay any attention to her. Come on, Stella. Let's... - It's a toy. - Shut up. - Where'd you get it, Phyllis? Did you get it at school, huh? - What if it's not a toy? - Did you? - Is it a toy? - It's a toy. - [Albert] (muffled) It's not a toy. - All right. Believe me, it's a toy. - But... Listen. Phyllis, we're just gonna turn around and go. We're just gonna get out of here. Come on, Stella, let's go. - It's all right, Albert. - Stella, come on. - Albert, it's all right. - Stella, come on! - It's all right, dear. - Stella, look, wait a minute, wait a minute, I just want to... (gun clicks) (Phyllis laughs) (Phyllis crying) - I got you, Phyllis. I got you, I got you. Okay. (gentle music) (Phyllis crying) (gentle music) Hi, there. - [Albert] Hi. How is she? - [Stella] She'll be fine, Albert. - [Albert] Ah, okay. (gentle music) - All right, boys and girls, I've got some pattern changes for some of you. Who's not real busy? No, Al, I've got something special for you. Uh, Freddie. There. Edie. -Hmm? - You can handle two, honey. Okay, Al, here's Norm's new design. See if you can have a pattern for me by the time you go home, all right? - Okay, Ned, but that's only an hour. I could stay late, though, if you want. - No, that's all right. You can have it to me by 10 tomorrow morning. - Okay. - All right? - Yeah. - Have fun, kids. (paper rustling) (bright music) - Oh, here he comes! - He's such a fine baby boy. (gentle music) - Look at his hands. - We did it, Albert. We did it. (Albert giggles) (gentle music) (Albert laughs) (baby fussing) (baby crying) Mm. - [Albert] Nom-nom time. (baby crying) I'll do it. (baby crying) (Stella moans) - All right, little Albie, here's Daddy. Here I am, yeah. Oh yeah, don't worry about a thing. Yes, little thing, yes, little honey. (Albert murmuring to baby) Good morning. Little Albert's gonna get some yum-yums from Mummy. Yes, yes. There you go. - Oh, Little Albert just shit in his diaper. - Oh. - Didn't you, baby? Didn't you? Don't you worry, though, your Daddy's gonna change that for you. - Oh, give Daddy just 30 seconds and he'll do that. - Snuggle up. - Oh. - Snuggle up. - Maybe 60 seconds. - So sweet. Shh. (telephone rings) - [Woman] Style Design of California. Yes, thank you, hold on, please. Style Design of California. Yes, hold on, please. - Terri, if Harry calls from Gauvot's, you can reach me in the showroom, all right? - And uh, when you have a chance, make me three copies of that. (sewing machines whirring) - All right, Armando, let's see what you have here. Yeah, I like this size stitch in the white, all right? Don't let it get any bigger than that. - Yeah, what if we did that in black? - Instead of the white? - I'd just like to see it. - Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Let's see that stitch in black, all right? No bigger. Ah, Peter! Peter, yeah, give Armando those things and he'll do them in black, all right? The black was an interesting idea. You know, it's going to settle into gray and I think... No, no, no, no. See how it bunches up here at the waist? That's not good. And these silk buttons, I thought I'd changed that. Chastity, are you wearing number 513 with the changes? Yeah, come on down, hon. Thank you, sweetie. Oh, now, look, this is how it's supposed to look right here. And look at the difference that the Lucite makes. Isn't that something? - Yeah, that part's great. - All right, now I want us to make sure that we have the silk buttons changed to the Lucite in time for the show. Al right? Make sure you take care of that. Yeah, Al, unfortunately our market is for suburban cows with big boobs. Make sure you change the silk buttons to the Lucite and can we do something about those shoes? - Okay. - That color just doesn't work with that dress at all. All right, next! Come on, girls. (baby crying) - Well, do you think we have everything, Albert? Huh? (baby crying) - [Albert] Yeah! I don't see anything else! - I know, I know, we'll give you lunch in a minute. (baby crying) - No, I think that's it. We got it all. - Yeah? - Yeah. (laughs) Oh, aren't you excited? (baby crying) Oh, Albie, don't you weep. - It's okay. - Yeah. - Let's go. - Bye, house! Bye! (car door bangs shut) Albert, where's Chuck? Huh? - Right back here. - Where? - Look in the back window. - Oh. Okay. - [Albert] I'll see you there, right? - [Mover] Okay. (motor revving) (car rumbling off) - You eat bananas, I'll eat you. Here you go. Shh. What's down there? Oh, what ho! It's dessert! No, it's time to eat. (baby fussing) (Stella laughs) Open up. (telephone rings) Hello. - Hi. (disco music playing) - Oh, it's, hold on a second, talk to Albert. - [Albert] Okay. - Here's your Daddy. - [Albert] Hello, kiddo! - Who is that? - [Albert] Hello, kiddo. - Huh? Hello. How did it go? - Oh, it went fine, it went wonderfully. Yeah, it was terrific. - Let's you and me go out alone together tonight and celebrate, okay? I've got a babysitter all lined up. -I can't. Look, I really can't because Ned is having this, oh, he's having this little thing here, you know, a little party. - Well, why don't I join you, hmm? - You could, but it's only going to last a couple of hours. By the time you got here it'd be over. - You're really in a funny mood for somebody who's just had a great triumph, I'll tell ya. - I'm in a fine mood, dammit, I'm in a perfectly fine mood. I was when I called you up. It's just that it's a business thing and I have to stay for it. - I just miss you, that's all. I'd like to see you. - I miss you, too. - [Ned] Where've you been? - Look, it won't be more than a couple of hours, okay? - Come on. - I promise you, just... - Let's go. - I will, I will. - Okay? - They want you out there. - Lorenzo's here. - We'll talk in a, in a little while. - Okay. Would you come home soon, though? - Come on. - Oh, okay. Stella, I gotta go. - Okay. See you later. - Bye-bye. Wait, wait, wait, that's my drink there. My drink. Okay. - [Ned] Hurry, buddy. You're a big star. - Want anymore banana? - Hiya, kiddo! Hello, kiddo! (Albert chuckles) How are ya? There we go. 'Morning. - 'Morning. - [Albert] Hiya, Chuck! Oh, I don't have a lot of time, Stella. - Yeah. I didn't hear you come in last night. - Yeah. Well, I didn't make a lot of noise, did 1? - Mm-mm. What time did you get home, Albert? -Um... I don't know, about 1:30. One maybe. - I was up with the baby at 2:30, Albert. - Okay, three o'clock. Why are you making such a big thing of it? - I'm not making a big thing of it. It's just that it's been happening awfully frequently and I was just wondering why. - Nothing has been happening. - That's right. That's right, nothing has been happening. You're right. We haven't been out at all alone together, Albert. I mean, not in weeks. We haven't gone to a film. We haven't gone to dinner. We haven't... - Stella, I'm bringing out the spring line. That's a hell of a lot of work. - But it's not just that. - [Albert] Well, what? - It's when you're home. - Maybe you should go back to selling, you know? Full time. - That's no kind of an answer. Now, look, I understand, I understand you don't like it when I bring things like this up, but... - There's nothing to bring up. Look. We're taking over the sportswear division. Now, that's over twice the line that we have. Ned and I are supposed to consolidate it from out here. Oh, it's the most exciting thing that ever happened to me. - Oh. - Look... Uh, come by the office around 12:30, okay? And we'll have lunch. Just you and I, okay, baby? - Mm. - Hmm? Okay, now I gotta go. - Bye. - Can you get that, Burt, if she moves that much? (camera snapping) That's right, that's right. Wait a minute. Okay. - [Receptionist] Design of California. Oh, yes, Aunt Mary, hold on I got another call. - We're gonna go to a restaurant. You're gonna sit at the table in a little high chair, with a booster seat. - [Receptionist] Yes, thank you, I'll ring. - You excited, aren't you? What? (baby fussing) - [Receptionist] Aunt Mary, I can't talk to you. I'll call you back soon. - This is the one that drove us crazy. - Well, it was worth every minute, it's lovely. - Yeah. (gentle music) - It's so lovely. This is going to be a great season. You know, Harry's gonna love this stuff. You've done some very good work. - Ah, thank you. - It's a wonderful season. (Albert babbling) - You know, I felt jealous when I saw you two together? - Who? - You and Ned. - Ned? - Yeah. - (laughing) Stella, come on, he's my boss. (Stella laughs) (both laughing) Geez, Stella. Oh, you got a crazy mother. (melancholy music) (car door shuts nearby) (melancholy music) (door creaks) What are you doing up? - Roasting chestnuts. - God, Stella, it's three o'clock in the morning. - It's time for me to turn over my hourglass, isn't it? - Oh, God. - Where are you going? - I'm going to bed. It's three o'clock in the morning and I'm not in the mood for one of your chats! - Well, get in the mood! - Stella, I asked you to come along with me! What do you want? - "Come along if you want" is not my idea of an invitation, Albert, you know what I mean? I thought it was a cocktail party. - It was a cocktail party. - Most cocktail parties that I've ever been to were over by 10 o'clock at night. - You're eating junk food again. I thought you gave that up. - I thought you gave it up, too. Hmm? You and Ned. You've really become a Batman and Robin, haven't you? - Stella. It wasn't Ned's party. It was a business party. - Am I interfering in your life, sir? Listen to me carefully, because if I'm interfering in your life, your son and I can go very easily to the Y and get a room! - Oh, come on, you're talking silly and I'm not in the mood for an argument. - Better yet, why don't you go to the Y and get a room, huh? With Ned. And that way you and Ned can go down to the gym any time, night or day, and you can sit there and watch each other's muscles ripple! - Okay, maybe I will! (gentle music) 'Morning. Hiya. Stella. Stella. Tomorrow's the buyers collection and tonight we're having just a little pre-party thing, - you know? - Mm-hmm. - And I want you to come. You coming? - No. - Okay. Bye. (melancholy music) (Albert laughing nearby) - Oh, shit, put that all over you. (laughs) Wait, wait, wait! No! Okay. (Albert laughing) Wait a minute. Don't get it in my eye, come on! It's getting into my eye. Is it In yours, too? (laughs) Okay. Oh, God. Oh! Uh... Stella, wait a minute! Stell, wait, Stell. Uh, listen. Uh, Stella... - Excuse me, Albert, - for interrupting you. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me just tell you what was happening... - I'm so sorry. - Because it wasn't what it looked like. - Did I embarrass you, Albert? - No, no. - Is that it? Did I, you're embarrassed. - No. - You're embarrassed, Albert? - Stella, please. - Is that it? Are you embarrassed? - Before you say anything! - Are you embarrassed? - Stella, just let me... - Am I embarrassing you, - Albert, is that it? - Wait a minute! Ow, ow! - Am I embarrassing you? - Stella, wait a minute! - Huh? - Stella, will you wait a minute? - Wait? - Please? - For what, Albert? For me or for you? For us? - Forget it! - Come on, Stella! Cut it out! - Forget it, Albert! I've had it up to here with waiting! Well, I've had it with waiting! - Stella! I want to talk to you for a second... - You want! You want! You want! You got what you want! This! This is what you want, right? (girl screams) Well, go get it! - You want it, take it! - Stella! - Wait a minute, please. - Take it, Albert! Take it! - Cut it out, will you? Owl Ow, come on that hurt! Stella, listen to me, will you? Listen to me for a minute! Stella, goddammit! Ah, shit! Stella! Stella! (bangs door) (melancholy music) (telephone rings) Hello? - Oh, my God, you're home. I thought you had an accident. Now, that I could understand. Albert, it's past 10 o'clock and Bloomingdale's is gonna be here at any time now. (line buzzing) Albert? (dramatic music) (telephone ringing) (dramatic music) (doorbell buzzes) (doorbell buzzes) - All right. (doorbell buzzing) Hi, Malcolm. I want to talk to Stella. - She doesn't want to talk to you, Albert. (door bangs shut) - Stella! (raps on window) Stella! (raps on window) Stella! (pounding on door) - She's not gonna... - Malcolm, I want to see my wife and my son! He's my son, too, I have that right! - They're not here. - Damn! - Oh, that does it. I'm gonna call the cops. - Malcolm, you don't have to call the police! All I want to do is see my son and my wife. - Stella, your father's going crazy in here. He's going to call the police. You come in here now. - [Albert] Stella! Stella? Stella? - You son of a bitch. - See, they're talking. Don't dial. - Operator, get me the police. - [Stella] I have nothing to say to you anymore, Albert. - Stella. I love you, Stella. I just want to talk to you. Please, just listen to me for a while. - Don't you have a show today? - Hello? Yeah, there's a crazy man attacking us over here, we... What? - Please, just listen to me now... - I have nothing to say to you anymore. - Look, whatever I did I have a right to explain it. - They put me on hold. This is your last chance not to get a record. - Malcolm, it's none of your business! - Albert, I'm getting a divorce. - Not a divorce. Stella, that's ridiculous! That's absurd! - Did you hear that? They're getting a divorce. - [Albert] That's unreasonable, listen... - Oh, see what you've done! Give me that. - I'm seeing a lawyer tomorrow. Move your foot. - What? (door bangs shut) - Hello? No, officer. This was a crank call. (car rumbling) - I miss you, but Grandma's allergic to cats. - [Albert] Stella! Stella! Stella, look! Look, Stella, I quit! I quit! - Ow! - Stella! Stella, wait a minute! Wait a minute. Stella! Stella, talk to me, come on. Stella, wait a minute! Wait, will you talk to me? Come on, yell at me, hit me! (music blaring on radio) (car horn honks) Do anything you want, but don't ignore me, Stella, please! (music blaring on radio) Stella, come on, I'm not gonna let you go. (car horn honking) Stella, I love you! Stella! Stella, will you, Stella! Just please, come on... (tires screeching) (music blaring on radio) - You all right? - Yeah. - Good. (tires screeching) - No, wait! I'm hurt! I'm hurt! Stella! Wait, I'm hurt, I'm dying! (motorcycle roaring) - [Receptionist] Could you spell that for me, please? M-Y-♪-H-R-A-L-L Agency. All right, yes, I'll have him call you. Bye-bye. - Will you give that to Stella, please? - Uh, yeah, but... - She'll know what it's about. - [Receptionist] Okay. Stella. - Yeah, yeah? - There's something here for you. (telephone ringing nearby) (Stella laughs) What is it? - (chuckles) It's a cake in a purple box. (both laughing) - Aw. - It's got jimmies on it, too. - Yeah. (laughs) (Stella laughs) - Didn't really puff up too good, did it? (laughs) (telephone ringing) Hello. - Hey, hey, Stella, huh? - Hi, Sam. - [Sam] Hey, Stell, you know that guy from Saudi Arabia? I just sent him over to the Maulia mansion. I told him you'd meet him there. - (sighs) I can't. I can't, I just put the muchacho in for his nap and there's nobody here to muchacho-sit. - Stella, it's a very big deal. Look, I'd go myself. All he needs is one more look at the house, huh? - It better be worth a fortune, kiddo. (toy clatters) So there's five bedrooms upstairs and there's four down. And then, if you remember, there's the uh... (motorcycle roaring) There's the apartment... - How much are the taxes? - The taxes, um... Let's see, the taxes are uh... - How much? - $12000, Mr. Hashmoni. - Oh, thanks. But I don't know anything about this neighborhood. - Oh, it's a very nice neighborhood. It's very quiet and stable. I'm sure you'll like it, this is very nice. Look, perhaps you'd like to see the... - Stella, wait a minute, I want to talk to you. - Albert, I'm working. Albert, I'm working! - I don't care if... - Please, I'm working! - Stella, I want to talk to you. - Albert! - I want to talk to you. Stella, I'm gonna talk to you, whether you want to talk or not. - Excuse me, please. - Sorry, she's my wife, it's okay. Now, come here. Here. Sit here and listen to me and after that you can do anything you want, okay? First of all, I'm an idiot, okay? I admit that. What I did was stupid. I never loved that girl, I... I guess that for months that I've been trying to prove something, you know? Trying to be somebody I'm not and, and you told me that. And that's over and that's finished and I understand that. Uh... I don't know how to say what I want to say, but I know, look, I know that we can't throw away everything that we are to each other. Stella, you're the most important thing in my life to me. You're my best friend. And I love you. And I need you. And that's it. That's it, that's all I want to say. Now, you decide if you never, ever want to see me again. If you think that that's what's best for you and the baby, okay, that's what I'll do. Yes or no? (gentle piano music) Just give me a nod, you know? You just need to nod. If you don't nod to me, that's it. I'll never, ever see you again. Never. Ever. (dramatic music) Was that a nod? (dramatic music) - Excuse me, Mr. Hashmoni, I didn't uh, mean to keep you waiting. Uh... I'm very sorry to involve you in my personal life. Can I walk you to your car? - Yes, please. Thank you. (dramatic music) (motorcycle crashes) (Albert screams) - [Stella] Albert! Albert, are you hurt? Albert! Albert! Albert, are you all right? Albert, what did you do? You better be all right. Huh? - Was that a nod? - You son of a bitch, Albert.
