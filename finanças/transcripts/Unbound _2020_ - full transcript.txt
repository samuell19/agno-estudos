(dramatic orchestral music) (bell chiming) (soft piano music) - Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. - Confess your sins, son. - I can't. You told me not to tell you things that I can't take back. - Julius, I understand. What is bothering you today? - Everything. I'm having a hard time trying to understand how to deal. My daughter hasn't come home. I'm not quite sure if she ever will. I'm having terrible thoughts, Father, terrible thoughts that I just can't understand. - Your daughter will find her way. The Lord will give you strength. Let me read you a verse, Proverb 29:11, "Fools give full vent to their rages, but the wise bring calm in the end." - I know in my heart that I have to forgive, but I don't know who to forgive. I'm gonna do something bad, something real bad. - Think, before you do. May God bless you, son. (Julius sighs) - Oh my God. I'm heartily sorry for having offended thee and I detest all my sins because I dread the laws of heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all, because of having offended thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy Grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen. - Amen. (Julius sighs softly) - I never showed emotion like the others. 'Cause they were weak. My heart may have skipped a beat, when I heard she went missing. She wasn't so perfect. In fact, in my eyes, she wasn't perfect at all. I loved my daughter. But I knew, deep down inside, the girl never loved me. They say, what makes a woman an angry woman is another woman who destroys her family. You have made me very, very angry. (somber, dramatic music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic music) Mary Louise, it is Marcia. Your appointment was at 11, and it is now 11:45. You know, I have three people waiting on your turn. Three people, just dying to have a reading with Madam Marcia. So kindly call me back, woman, or I swear on the baby Jesus, I will never, ever give you a reading again, bitch. Stupid bitch. Everybody wants a reading. Oh, tell me your fortune. What's my fortune? Am I gonna be rich? Am I gonna be pretty? How the hell do you do this shit? Answer, quick. What does tomorrow hold for... What the hell? (gentle dramatic music) - Good morning, Julius. - Joel. (knocking on pool table) Can I help you with something? - I was hoping you heard something from the police. - You know, how these boys work. Louisiana time, slow as shit. I ain't heard nothing, so you ain't gonna hear nothing. - Don't you think this is a little odd? - What is? - Not a single word. It's been three weeks. It doesn't look good, I don't have a good feeling about this. We gotta do something! - Well, shit, Joel. Maybe you should take your ass and look for your son yourself. What the hell do you want from me? My daughter is missing too. The law ain't gonna help us. The town ain't gonna help us. But I'm gonna help myself. (pool ball thuds) (pool balls clashing) (blues vocal music) ♪ As I woke up this morning ♪ ♪ Looked out the door ♪ ♪ Yes, I know my mother milk cow, baby ♪ ♪ By the way she lowed ♪ ♪ If you see my momma milk cow ♪ ♪ I said, please, drive her home ♪ ♪ I ain't had no milk and butter ♪ ♪ Since my cow been gone ♪ (Stan groaning) - I'm gonna remove your hood. You scream and I'll chew your face off. Don't scream. I wanna ask you a few questions. I just want answers. Make it quick and simple and we can move on. Agreed? (Stan groans) (tape ripping) - Help! Hel- (punch thwacks) (Stan groans) - I told you not to scream, you little prick. Why would you ever wanna make this hard? (Stan groaning) I hate people like you. You see? I'm giving you a chance! A chance to talk, to plead your case. (punch smacks) (Stan groaning) (Stan coughing) - I didn't scream. - [Julius] I know. - Then why'd you hit me? - [Julius] Reflexes. - I didn't scream. - [Julius] I know, that's why I didn't hit you again. - [Stan] Sir, I didn't do anything to your daughter. (fly swatter swooshing) You got this all wrong. - You lie. (chuckling) I don't make mistakes. Well, I do, but in this case, I ain't. (sighs) You see, my daughter's gone missing. It's been four months now. The police haven't found nothing. That private-eye I hired hasn't found nothing. This leaves you, the last person her mother saw her with. (Stan sniffs) You must understand the situation. I mean, what would you do? - Sir, there are people looking for me. My mom, my dad, I know, and when they find out what you did... - No they won't. No one will. See, I has a note typed up to your parents. A note that states that you were taking off, moving to bigger and better places. I had that private detective on your school records and so forth. Nothing higher than a C, but tons of D's in school. (Julius laughing) He found out, your school. And your parents, Edna and, and, and... - And Joel. - Joel. (chuckles) They were contacted multiple times to come in and work out your suspensions, but nothing. Word around town is, they haven't reported it yet, or just ain't asking. No, I'm pretty sure they don't give a shit about you. - What are you gonna do to me? (fly swatter clatters) - Well, that depends on you. In turn, I'm depending on you. Now tell me, where is my daughter? - I don't know. (chains jangling) - See, that's not gonna help me. - I don't know how I can help you. - I'm trying to be nice here. I'm giving you opportunities. We're negotiating. There's gonna be some give, there's gonna be some take. (dramatic music) (Stan whimpers) Did you kill my Annabelle? Where is my daughter? - I don't know. - I'm running out of patience, fast. Soon, Stan, very soon, I'm gonna kill you. - No. (punch smacking) (Stan groaning) (Stan coughing) (kick smacking) (Stan groaning) (hand slapping) (Stan groaning) (Stan growling) (chain jangling) (Stan breathing heavily) (slow dramatic music) - Baby, ain't you gonna eat your food? - I'm not hungry. - Well, I made, I made all your favorites. - I'll put it away, have it later. - So how was work today? - Didn't go. - Well, where'd you go. - Does it matter? What is it with all the questions, woman? - You went back, didn't ya? You went back to the goddamn cemetery, hmm? She is not even there. (sighs) When are you gonna stop with all this, huh? You keep putting her there, in your mind, and that ain't good. - (sighs) What is wrong with you, huh? Why can't you leave me alone? I just wanna grieve. I just want this thing, this feeling to pass, so I can go on with my life, and you with yours. - It doesn't make sense. It doesn't. You are ruining us. Okay, whatever it is we have left, you are destroying it. (sighs) Hell, you think we are the only family that this has ever happened to, huh? - What a horrible, evil thing to say. We may not be the only people that this has happened to, but this has never happened to me. - Babe, we're gonna find a way. Okay? - A way to what? Bring our daughter back? Could be dead, rotting in some ditch somewhere, with some asshole, who killed her, pissing on her grave every day, just for fun. How could you not be furious? - Don't, don't say that. Okay, don't you talk like that. - I can't take it, Marcia, I just can't. The world is full of scum. I just can't stop thinking about it, thinking about what our daughter might've gone through. - It's gonna be all right, okay? I promise you, it is gonna be all right. It's going to be all right, okay, I promise you. I promise, it's going to be all right. - [Julius] Oh, thank you. - Gonna be all right. (knocking on door) - They are always on time. Please, Lord, let them have a lead, an answer. John Mcglone. - Good evening, Julius. Good evening, ma'am. - John. - So what's the story, Detective? Please tell me you have some news for my wife and I. - Well, I haven't found your daughter yet, but I did stumble on a few leads that might help. Now, apart from what we spoke about last week, about the boyfriend, you know, Stan, the one that went missing, I did get to speak to his parents and, unfortunately, they haven't heard anything. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even seem like they care. (Julius scoffs) And your daughter's bag, her ID was found, along with some cash. - You found my daughter's bag? What the hell, man, when? - Well, take it easy, it was just yesterday and we had to run the routine. You know, we had to do fingerprints, and forensics, and so forth. - Well, what did ya find? - Unfortunately, nothing. - How could there be nothing? - Well, it looks like the bag was basically untouched and nothing was taken out. It was as if the bag was just dropped. - Are you ever gonna find our daughter? Hmm? - Ma'am, you gotta believe me, I'm doing the best I can. Are you okay? Is there something you need to tell me? - Oh no, I'm, (chuckles) I'm fine. I'm fine. - So what happens next? - Well, what'll happen next is, I'll be back, of course, if I have more to tell you. In the meantime, I just need you to sign the forms. You know, let's the department know I was here, what we discussed, and that you understand. - Of course. (pen clicking) - If you could sign right here, please. - [Julius] Thanks. - Thank you. We'll be in touch. (Julius sighing) - [Marcia] All right. You have a nice night, now. - John. - You too, ma'am. - Thanks, Officer. - You're welcome, sir. (Marcia sighing) - Okay. Whatever. (stairs creaking) (soft, suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) - Jesus, Julius. Did you wait for me? - As I always do. - It's getting hard to cover for you, down there. Everyone's asking questions. - Yeah? Like who? - [Phil] Like everyone. - [Julius] You're the manager, you make those decisions, correct? - I, I make decisions, but I don't make every decision. - You know, I shoulda had your job. - Somehow I knew this was gonna come up. - I fought 10 years, 10 years to get that job, and baby dick walks in and takes it. - [Phil] Give him a cocktail. - You went and you walked your little frat boy ass into that office, and walked out with the title, bank manager. - Bank manager. - It's all right. You're a good kid. Yep. You're like the son I never had. - I guess you're the 50-year-old grandpa I never had. (Julius laughing) - You gonna go there, huh? (sighs) - Where were you today? Julius. I don't think you're gonna find what you're looking for at the cemetery, man. I think that's the last place you're gonna find answers. - You know what I been thinking about, Phil? When I was a kid, my buddies and I, we'd shoot basketball, down at the old Recreation Center on 5th and Robinson. That summer, I met a girl, Rebecca. They'd just moved here. She didn't talk much. (chuckles) I don't know, one day, she decided to come up, and say hello. She walked right up onto the court and she told me that she would kick my ass in basketball, any day. - No? - Yeah! And walked right out the door. - I bet she did. - She waited for me outside. I wasn't mad, I couldn't get her out of my head. She was beautiful, innocent, and those eyes... We were together for months, kissed once or twice, but it wasn't about that. We, we were like soulmates. One night I was upstairs, looking through my car magazines. Saw the light outside my bedroom. I watched through the window for hours, 'til the sun came up, 'til all the cars left. Her mother and father cried for hours on their front porch. Someone killed their daughter. It's happening to me now. Why Phil? Why would God do this to me? - I don't know. (slow dramatic music) - My momma didn't want me to go to the funeral. (sighs) She said it would stay with me forever. That sadness never goes away. - They're gonna find your daughter. They will. Then you can put all this behind us. Hey, what do you say we get started, huh? (fire crackling) (sad piano music) (photograph ripping) (soft, dramatic cello music) (Stan groaning) (chains jangling) (Stan groaning) (chain thudding) (Stan sobbing) (light switch clicks) - I'm begging you, Stan. I'm begging you. Please. Just tell me where she is. - [Stan] Please. - I don't get it, I just don't get it. Why? Why would you let this drag on for so goddamn long? It's killing me inside to do this to you. I thought you were a good kid, an honest kid. I let you come over, made you sandwiches, let you watch movies, saw you put your greasy fucking arm around my daughter's shoulders and didn't say a thing. Now, do me the courtesy, and tell me where my daughter is. - [Stan] I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. (kick thwacking) (Stan groaning) - Don't touch me, Phil! - You're gonna kill the kid. - [Julius] If he dies, then he dies. - If he dies, you don't get the answers you wanna hear. Yeah, think about that. - Okay. - [Stan] No. - You gotta understand, kid. I'm Annabelle's father. My Belle is all I have. My Belle is my life. I will not let this go. I refuse to let my baby die this way. (light switch clicks) (mallet and door clattering) - Well, well, well. What have we here, huh? I know you was fired. Mm-hmm. I called for you last week. I called and someone else picked up. Young kid, barely a man, said he didn't know what I was talking about. Said he was the replacement for the guy that never came back. (laughs) The guy that never came back, well, you know, that makes perfect sense, since you ain't brought home no paycheck. - Shut up. - [Marcia] They had to let you go didn't they? Can't blame 'em. - [Stan] Please. - Look what our lives have become, huh? You don't give a shit. You don't give a shit about us. You don't give a shit about me. - Shut up. - They took the car, you know. They're gonna take the house. And then what, huh? Then what, Julius? You gonna let some man come on in here and take a little bit of me too, huh, is that what you're gonna do? That's what you're gonna let happen, huh? - Shut your goddamn mouth. Not another word outta you, or so help me, I will shove my fist down your throat, and out your ass, and strangle you with my shitty hands. (mallet thuds) - You have become a disgusting, despicable, drunk fool. I have no use for you. I hope you drop dead. - You were always disgusting and despicable. I hope you drop dead. I hope you drop dead, right now. I'm planning on setting the house on fire. I don't care. All right. (Stan panting) Wait a week to do the laundry, that's what you do. It all piles up. Take it there. And that. (door clatters) (Julius murmuring) (door slams) Why can't this bitch leave me alone? No wonder she left. (object thuds) (Stan whimpers) It's because of you. You! This is your fault. You turned my life upside down. You ripped my soul, my family apart. I will make you pay. You won't give me answers, I won't give you your life back. Simple as that. (dramatic music) (Stan groaning) Open up. Take it, boy. (Julius laughing) (Stan spluttering) You getting what you deserve, boy. (Julius laughing) (chains jangling) That's what you get. Maybe I'll read you a bedtime story. (hand thuds) (chair thuds) Tonight, I'll be back to visit you. How do you like that? Huh? Come on, answer me or something, huh? - [Stan] No. - Here's what I'm gonna do, about that. Make you something really nice and special. You know what I'm gonna do? Maybe I'm gonna take a shit, I'm gonna cut that up, and serve it to you on a cracker. Hmm, what do you think of that? - Hmm? - [Stan] No. - You brought this upon yourself, remember that. Eventually, Stan, you're gonna talk. (dramatic music) Okay. - Oh, hell, no. Oh my God, Julius, you stink. No, no, you know what, you know the rules, okay? Now go take a shower if you finished playing with your pet in the basement. Go on, go on, get outta here. You ain't coming into bed with me like that. God, you smell. God, disgusting. Asshole. What's wrong with you? Go take a shower or something. (Annabelle sobbing) - No, no. Don't you love me, Daddy? Why won't you help me, Daddy? (sobbing) (Julius humming) - (chuckling) What? What do you want? - What you gonna do about him? - Who? - What do you mean, who, asshole? That piece of shit in the basement. You know, the one that you kick the shit of, every day, before you climb your sorry, dirty ass into bed with me at night. - Don't you worry about that, that has nothing to do with you. (Marcia sighs) - Nothing to do with me, huh? - No. - You leave me here with him, every single day. He could get loose, he could break free. You know, he could kill me. He could easily kill me. That's what I have to worry about. - I'm gonna take care of him. (suspenseful music) (door clicking) Yeah. But I need you. Just come. (light switch clicks) (plate clatters) Eat. Eat the shit. You're gonna need your energy for tonight. I don't plan to go easy on you. Soon, very soon, Stan, I'm gonna kill you. Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. (soft dramatic orchestral music) (door clicking) (gentle piano music) (Stan scrabbling) (Stan grunting) (chain jangling) (Stan chewing) (Stan breathing heavily) - [Stan] Son of a bitch. - What, you going to work today? You know, we can't keep living on what we got left. All right? We are scraping the barrel here, Julius. You know, I can't go nowhere, I can't do nothing. I gotta stay here all day long and make sure your little science experiment don't run off. What kind of life is that for me, huh? What kind of freedom do I get, huh? - Marcia, please. - [Marcia] No, no, no, this is not a good think. - For you, it's not a good thing, but for me it's justice. I'm doing what's right for this family, my family. The hell with the law. They can't do what they're supposed to do, I will do it myself. You have to understand. They have to understand. You fuck with my family, I will make them pay. I'm sorry. - How long is this gonna go on? - As long as it takes, baby. As long as it takes. - (sighs) Oh, Jesus. - Baltimore, San Francisco, who won? - Didn't watch it. - You didn't watch it? That's your team, buddy. What's the plan for today, boss? We're gonna have to talk about him. - [Julius] Who? - [Phil] The kid. - You've been talking to Marcia. (chuckles) - [Phil] No. Why? - She asked me the same thing. I'll take care of it. - How? - I'm trying to figure it out. It's not an easy process. - You've only got one option. You can't let him go. - I never killed a man. I don't think I can. How the hell did it get to this? My life was good. Not incredible, but good. Not great, but good. She was going to school. She could have been a doctor, (sighs) maybe a lawyer or a teacher. Shit, she coulda been something. (sighs) It's not fair, not to me, not to her. It wasn't supposed to happen to us. - Who was it supposed to happen to, then? Can't you see this is all bullshit, Julius? You have to kill the kid. Get rid of him, kill him, do whatever you have to do to end this shit, or we all suffer the consequences. (bird chirping) - My lady. - Oh, Antonio, thank you for the coffee. That was so thoughtful of you. - You're welcome. Oh, what a beautiful day. - I know. (chuckling) - You know, there was a man in the coffee shop and he was just angry at the world. - You don't say. - He was mean, ignorant, downright nasty. - No way. - In my country, that would be a joke. Life is about passion, embracing the inner love and sharing it with the world. - Oh, I know. I know. - Look at your eyes. Your eyes are like the Eiffel Towers and spring. I just wanna bathe in them. My darling, I hate to ask you. By any chance, did you bring the money? - Yeah. This should be the last of it, correct? - In a perfect world, it would be, but I will make do. Oh Lord have mercy, look at the time. My darling, I have a very important meeting and I must fly. You know, I seek fast-paced intensity. Action, action, action. - When am I gonna see you again, though? - Soon, in time. - You want action? Well, I could show you action. - Oh my darling. - Well... - Please, not in front of the flag. - Not that kind of action. It's a secret, and it's something that nobody can know. - Show we now? - Soon. In time. I'll call you. Thank you for the coffee. I'll call you. (Stan sobbing) - I didn't do anything. (sobs) Help! Please. (sobs) Please, help me. - I had a great night. - That's it, just great? - Perfect. - Okay. I know with you going out East for college, and I'm due at university. I wanna find a way to make this work. I've never been with somebody this long. Never felt like this, never. - I feel the same way. I never met a boy like you. - I just wanna tell you that... - What? Tell me what? (Stan sighs) Stanley Peters, do you love me? - I do. - How much? - Enough to wrap this planet 10 times. - Is that it? - Just about. And do you love me? - What a silly thing to ask. Oh Stan! Stan, what is that? (gentle, hopeful music) I do, I love you. (knocking on car door) - Well, well, well. What have we here, huh? What are you kids having like a little sexual picnic? Annabelle, get yourself out of the car now. Get out. Get out and go upstairs, and stop acting like a whore. And you, Mr. Stanley, well, you may wanna take a little bit of advice, okay? You may wanna sow your wild oats with somebody else's daughter 'cause you ain't gonna do it with mine. Now you keep your hands to yourself before you end up not having any hands. You understand me, boy? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. - Yes, ma'am. - I said I can't hear you. - Yes, ma'am, I understand you. - That's a little bit better, now. Now you get yourself outta here. Drive safe though. Have a good night. - Thank you. (car door slamming) Oh, shit, oh my God. Oh, what did I do. What did I do. Stupid, stupid. (Stan sobbing) I didn't do anything. (sobbing) Help! (soft dramatic music) - Hey, Antonio, hi. It's Marcia. Julius just left so I'm at the house by myself. I was wondering if you wanna come over. Remember that thing I was telling you about in the park? Yeah, well, I was wondering if you wanna see what I was talking about. Yeah, no, I'm here, I'm here. Okay, great, I'll wait for you. All right, (laughs) I can't wait to see you. (knocking on door) Okay, bye. Julius, what the hell did you forget now? (knocking on door) - Marcia. - Joel. - I hope I'm not outta place, but, I, look, I sincerely, I apologize for the intrusion. Have you heard anything? - What? About your boy? - Yeah, it's been weeks. The police must have said something, anything. Look, my wife and I are going crazy. I'm sure you can understand. One parent to another, it's a lot of sleepless nights. - We ain't heard nothing. Hell, all I know is, maybe your boy, my girl, maybe off in some hick town in Georgia. You know, maybe they're drinking, maybe they're drugging. Maybe he's making her have sex 'cause, you know, he is a disrespectful piece of shit. - Oh, you don't have to talk that way about my boy. - Best be on your way, Joel, hmm? - Look, I'm sorry for the interruption, but damn, woman! Come on! - First of all, Joel, don't you ever yell in my house. And secondly, like I said before, I think you best be on your way. (door slamming) (knocking on door) - Hey. - Hey, hi. - Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine. - I came right over. - Oh, thank you for coming. No, I'm fine, really. - Can I come in? - Oh (laughs) my goodness. Please excuse my rudeness. Absolutely, please, come on in. - And I take it that your husband is not here, is that correct? - Correct. In fact, he won't be back for quite some time. (laughs) - All right. You said that you had something you wanted to show me? - Yeah. But you can't tell nobody. - All right. - You can't tell nobody. - Okay. - Okay. You can't say a word. - All right. (soft dramatic music) Shit. Shit. Oh my God! This is crazy. That is some crazy shit. - This is, you wanted action, right? - No. No, no, not this, I wasn't talking about this. - Did, you said this what you want, you love this kind of shit. I mean you made a whole production about it, out in the park. You wanted action, you wanted adventure. - I was not talking about this. I was talking about travel, sex, a blowjob, maybe, with a little teeth. - Well then, maybe you should have been a little bit more clear. - But tell me something, Marcia. What are you doing in there? Are, you kidnapped that kid to harvest organs? Is that what you're into? I gotta get the hell outta here. - Oh, hell no, you can't go. You can't tell a soul about this, okay, you can't go. - Listen. Just, just level with me, all right? Are you kidnapping people, trying to impress me? - You know, sometimes, sometimes, people just do some crazy shit, baby, crazy shit. (kissing) - Get off me, you crazy bitch. - You can't tell a soul. You can't tell nobody about this. - All right. 10,000. - What? - 10,000. I'm gonna need 10,000. - Have you lost your mind? Are you crazy or what? - Well, you're right, I think I am a little crazy. I think, I think I underbid myself. 20,000. 20,000 cash to keep my mouth shut. I'm gonna need 20,000. - Oh, goddamn you, I should have known better. Fine. - Fine. - Fine, I will get you your 20,000 or whatever it is you want, and in the meantime you can take your sorry ass and get the hell out of my house. - Fine. - Go, get outta my house now. - Fine. - Fine. - 5,000 cash- - Whatever, go, just get out of my house. - All right. - Get out. - After you. - Asshole. - Asshole? You're the one got a man chained to the wall. - I don't believe you. You have some pair of balls, you really do. I am so aggravated to leave you. - Hi. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm a, I'm a friend. - Speak your face. - I'm a friend. - Marcia, who is this man, and why is he in this house, my house? - I'm a friend. I'm a friend. - A friend of who, my wife? Does he know? - Know what? - I don't know anything. Nothing. - I knew she was gonna mess this up. - What do you wanna do? - Nothing. You leave him alone. Don't you touch him. - How long? How long have you been sleeping with this man, Marcia? - Wait a second, I have not slept with this woman. - Oh, well, not yet, anyway. - You lousy bitch. You bring a man into my house, you show him the situation in our basement, and you tell me that nothing's going on? How stupid do you think I am? He's gonna go to the cops. - No he's not. - Yes. - No, Julius. - He's gonna rat us out. - No he will not. - You and I are going to jail. - No, you're wrong. - You hear me? Tell me, how could you be so careless? - Julius, just take it easy, okay. - What a shitfest this is. - He ain't gonna say a word. - How do you figure that? - You shut up. - We made a deal. - A deal? - Yes. - What kind of a deal? - I'm gonna pay him a little bit of money, help fund his venture. - [Julius] How much is a little bit? - 30,000 - [Marcia] We agreed on 20. - And how, better yet, where are we gonna get this money? - I don't know, Julius, maybe I wanna sell a couple of things. - I'm gonna kill him and bury you up his ass. - You're nasty. (doorbell rings) - How many goddamn boyfriends do you have? - You want me to get the doorbell? - You shut up. - Look, before the shit gets any crazier, do we have a deal? - No. - Yes. - Fine. Deal. - 40 grand - You son of a bitch. - Take it easy. (doorbell rings) - Okay, just shut your mouth and let me talk. (doorbell rings) Phil, go down to the basement and make sure that the kid keeps quiet. (door slams) Officer Mcglone. - Good afternoon. Can I come in? - We were kind of in a family discussion. - Good afternoon. - Of course, you know Marcia. - John. - And this is... - Antonio. - Yeah, Antonio, her gay friend. At least, I think he's gay. (laughs) - I've told him a hundred times, I'm not gay. - It's fine. All right, I just wanted to let you know that I am working on a few things, but I didn't find anything to alert you with. All I need today is just the usual signature. - A signature, may I inquire as to why? - He doesn't know? - No. - I didn't think this was something you'd keep a secret. - Oh, it doesn't concern him. Like I said, he's just a friend of the wife. Just give me the paper. - Has there been a crime, officer? Should I be alarmed? - Absolutely not. - He was just leaving, John. He's not important. I'll just sign the papers, huh. - Can you explain to me, this relationship between this gentleman and your wife? - Coworkers. - But I thought you said Marcia was a homeworker, a stay at home wife, is what you said. - Ex-coworker. You know, they worked together at the, you know, at the goddamn supermarket, I don't know, why don't you ask her? - Spin class, actually, he's the dog walker. (chuckling) It doesn't really even matter. Sweetheart, why don't you just sign the papers so that Detective John can be on his way, huh? Just sign. (soft dramatic music) (light switch clicks) (Julius sighs) - Okay. Anything else? - No that is it. I'll be in touch. - [Julius] Sure. Thanks. - [Mcglone] You're welcome. - [Marcia] Have a nice day. - Bitch. - You whore. - I feel bad for you kid, I do. But he's a father. That's what any father would do in these circumstances. You understand? I don't blame him. Best thing for you to do, now, is confess. Do the right thing. Just do it. It may be your only chance. Just do it. (ax dragging on ground) (light switch clicks) - What the hell was that? No one told you to speak. - This is getting juicy. When I asked you for a little action and drama in my life, I never thought it was gonna be this good. - What the hell's he talking about? - Nothing, okay. Nothing. - Obviously, you know. You fucked this up. - What was that price we agreed upon? - I just wanna kill you both. - You know, you got too much on your hands, pal. Your choices are limited, almost non-existent. You're gonna pay me. You're gonna pay me, boy. I own you. I own you good. 50 large. - We agreed on 40,000, okay. - 50. - 40,000. - 10, that's all you're gonna get. - No, you're gonna pay me 50 and I'll tell you why. Because- (Marcia grunting) (dramatic music) (Marcia grunting) (flesh squelching) - What did you do? - Just getting rid of the problem, baby, okay? - Are you outta your goddamn mind? - He was trying to extort us. It had to be done. - Well, if you didn't bring this asshole into our house, we wouldn't have had this problem to begin with. You just killed the man in our kitchen. - So? - Are you kidding me? What are we gonna do? - Tell me something, Julius. What were, what were you gonna do with your little experiment in the basement, huh? What, you were just gonna let him, let him go free, huh? If he told you what you needed to hear, what you wanted to hear, what were you gonna do? Just let him go, and let him live? Now, I know you are stupid, but I don't think that you are that stupid. - I'll get rid of the body. (Marcia sighs) - You need to kill that kid. - [Julius] I know. - He leaves this house, baby, you and I are done. We are done, our lives are over. - I know. - And you, you need to let go of Annabelle too. - Just shut up! (Marcia breathing heavily) ♪ Somehow you found me ♪ ♪ When life was not so kind ♪ ♪ I believe that you saved me ♪ ♪ And you gave me peace of mind ♪ (Marcia laughing) (Stan scrambling) - [Stan] Come on, you son of a bitch. (object dragging) (Stan groaning) (rope bind rubbing) - Pretty girl. (soft dramatic music) Who's a pretty girl now, huh? You're the pretty girl. You're a whore. You are a goddamn whore. You are a goddamn a whore! You're a whore! You're a whore. As usual. (breathing heavily) (cards flicking) Oh my. - What do my cards read today? - Child, Madam Marcia sees some really good things in your future, your near future. In fact, I see a new hot love interest coming your way. (Marcia laughing) Oh. (gasps) It's gone. - What's gone? - My premonition. Gone, boom, gone. - Why? - Well, you know, Mary Louise, sometimes you need a little help, getting the message to come through from the other side? You know. (laughs) - You need some help with my scarf, right? - Seriously, woman? (Marcia humming) Oh. You know, that's nice, but I'm still a little fuzzy. (laughing) Thank you, thank you. Ooh, well, all of a sudden, I see clearly now. All righty, all righty, well. Ooh, child, he is tall, he's good-looking, he's dark, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, he's a little pale, a little pale. - Is he a doctor? - Well, of course he is, sweetheart. Of course. - Ooh, I like these games. (clapping) - Games? These ain't games, Mary Louise, okay. These are my premonitions. You know what? Your time is up for today, mm-hmm. - Okay. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. - Well, Mary Louise, nothing's for free, is it? Nothing's for free. Now, why don't we go have some tea in my garden? Okay? Come on, darling. (Julius sighs) - I don't know what to do. (laughs) Not a clue. I guess I'm just gonna have to... What I'd like to... Wait. I have come to the conclusion that you must die. I didn't wanna do this. I thought you would just tell me where my Belle is. Did she run away? Did you hurt my Annabelle? This, right here, this is the most I've ever gotten out of you. This is good. Why did it take so long? Did somebody kill my daughter? - Unbound me. - Did you kill my daughter? - Unbound me. - Answer my question. - Unbound me. (punch smacking) I know. - Know what? - Annabelle. - What the fuck did you do? - No, I won't tell you. - Why? I could kill you right now. - [Stan] That's why. - No. No. Now is not the time to play the bigshot. Your options have run out. - It'll be worth the wait. - When? - I want food and water. Yeah, a nice, deluxe cheeseburger with a side of home fries. And maybe some kindness from you, just a little bit. - Fuck that. You're lying to me, and I know it. I can feel it. I don't trust you. - You don't have to trust me. - What game are you playing? - No game. No game. (Stan sighs) But now is not the time to be a bigshot. Your options have run out. (whistling lightly) (chain jangling) - If you're lying to me, Stan, I'll kill you. - So I bought this down on Bourbon Street. They had a good sale, good sale, I tell you, girl. - Make me a burger, bitch. - How dare you? Never gonna make you no goddamn burger. Maybe I should make you a burger, maybe you'll choke on it. Redneck bastard. (car keys jangling) (car door creaking) - I got him. - Jesus, Julius, what are you doing here? - I got him. - Who? Make sense. - The kid, he confessed. Well, something like that. - You gotta keep it down, all right. This is my place of work. - The kid told me that he would tell me everything. - Wait, I don't get it. Except did he say he did it or not? - Well, not exactly. He asked for food, for a burger. Those were his conditions, negotiation. - All right, I'm not quite getting this. Did the kid say he did it or not? - Well, not exactly, but he's gonna tell me everything that went down. That's what he told me. (laughing) - That don't make sense, Julius. He's just telling you what you wanna hear, all right. - No. - He's gotta have some sort of- - No. - Yeah. - No, I don't believe that. I don't believe you. - Julius, kill the kid. - What if he knows what happened to my daughter? - He doesn't know. - What if he knows the people who were involved? - He doesn't know anybody. - He's gotta know something, this kid. What if he leads me to- - Julius, kill the fucking kid! Goddamn it. - I can't kill him. I know that killing is murder. I can't, I can't do it. - If you don't kill him, then I will. God. I got a meeting to go to, Julius. All right, get the fuck out of here. Go on, go! We'll talk about this later. I'll come by the house. - [Julius] You come on by. - I'll be by. - [Julius] All right. - And don't come out here again. (car keys jangling) (car ignition error beeps) (hand banging) Fuck! (car keys jangling) Goddamn it! (soft dramatic music) - Julius. - Joel. - Want me to buy you a beer? - No need. Mike, let me get the usual. - Sorry, Julius, I can't. The manager says you're bill's too high. - What the hell's going on, Mike? What are you, are you snitching on me? - Mike, it's okay. Give him what he wants, it's on me. You don't look so good. - Well, you know, life is kinda being a prick, right now. - Any news from them cops you have on the trail of our kids? - No. - I'm starting to get a real weird feeling about all this. - How do you figure? - Lack of communication, lack of info, all around bullshit. - Well, you know, Joel, I'm in the same boat as you. - No you're not. - Think I got secrets, Joel? - Yeah, yeah, I do. (Julius laughing) - And you don't? - Look, I don't know what it is you think you're trying to say. - We're from the same parish. Shit, I think we were even in love with the same girl. - What? - I'm not talking about your wife, I'm not talking about Marcia. I'm talking about a young girl, barely 14, didn't even start her life. - (laughs) What the hell are you talking about? - (laughs) It's okay. Take it easy. I'm past that. The whole town is past it. Tell me, Joel, where did you bury her? - What the hell are you... Julius, you're out of your mind, man. - I knew that you were jealous. I'd watch you. I took pride in knowing that you were jealous of the attention that Rebecca would give me. I know you killed her, Joel. I lived with that. I never said a word. Yeah. Good evening. - I swear to God. I swear, you spread this rumor around town, I swear I'll... - You're gonna what? You wanna kill me too? We all got secrets, asshole. Some worse than others. I know that your boy killed my daughter. I guess it runs in the family. I suppose God will give him what he deserves. (laughing) (gentle music) - [Marcia] Well, let's see what the cards have in store for you today. Can I tell you something, Mary Louise? - Sure. - You realize that all this card playing nonsense, it's all bullshit, right? - I know. - The devil. (laughs) The devil is real. Oh yeah. Makes you do crazy things. - Well, I, I don't understand you scaring me. - Am I? Well, sweetness, why don't we take a look at what the cards are saying, and maybe they can clear things up for you a little bit, okay? Dead, dead. Dead, dead, dead. - You okay? - No. No. I see things. - Like what? (Marcia sighs) - Like my daughter. - Is she alive? - No. No, she's dead. - Is it her ghost? I don't understand this, you said it was bullshit. - I don't know if it's her ghost, or if it's my guilt. I've done some terrible things. Some really, really bad things. - Like what? - I killed a man. - What? - I killed him, right upstairs, in my kitchen. Put a knife right in his back. Oh, everybody saw, everybody was looking, and he was saying things, and, well, I had to protect my family. And you know the funny thing? (chuckles) He was almost my lover. Yeah. 'Cause Julius, you know. Julius is, he gave up on me and us, a long time ago. Well, I needed someone. You know. I needed someone to love me. - Why are you telling me this? Marcia, I think it's time for me to go. - Yeah, I think you should go. I'm afraid I might kill your sorry little sweet ass as well. - God will frown on you. - Really, darling? Well, I guess that means you're coming to hell with me! (Mary Louise screams) - Forgive me, Father, for I'm about to sin. I don't reach the last level of sanity. I know my daughter's dead. I've accepted the fact that someone murdered my daughter, but it's time- - Julius, don't do what I think you're planning to do. God has his ways, they will be punished. - That I do not believe, Father. I must take this to the end. I have a man tied up in my basement. He's been there for four weeks. - Julius, please don't tell me that you're planning to- - I have to. This has to end. I know in my heart that this man killed my daughter and I demand before him blood runs in this family. I couldn't dig deep enough to kill this boy, but tonight I will. Now you may do whatever it is that you think you might need to do when I leave here, and I will forgive you. - Why would you tell me this? - If there's only one person smiling at me at the gates of heaven or hell, I'd rather it be you. (door clattering) (Julius sighing) I see you there. You look like you did something wrong. (laughs) - Nothing more wrong than what you've done. You know we can't fix this Julius, okay? And there comes a time in every man's life when he has to do what he has to do in order to save his family. - To avenge his family. I know he killed Annabelle. I see it in his eyes, he just won't confess. I never wanted to take a life. But you were right, Phil was right. He must die so that I can rest. - So that we can rest, baby. So that we can rest. - Our lives are over, Marcia. - No, no, no. - There's no turning back. - No, baby, don't say that, okay. No, listen to me, look at me. Look at me, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry for letting another man come between us. I love you. I love you so much. I'm sorry, baby. - And I did love you. (Marcia sobbing) We are over. - Baby. - We are done. - Don't say that, baby, please. - I have nothing. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe, forgive me. I'm sorry. - But you are my family. - (sobbing) Julius. - I will avenge my family. - Please. Please. (Marcia sobbing) (kissing) - I'm gonna see you in hell, Marcia. (Marcia sobbing) - Julius, please. Julius, I love you. Baby, please don't go. Please, please, Julius. Baby, please don't leave me here, okay, baby? Baby, please don't leave me here. Please. (Marcia sobbing) (sobbing) Baby, please don't. Don't leave me by myself. Baby, please, I beg you, please. Don't leave me here, Julius, please. (sobs) Baby, please come back. (sobs) Julius, please. I'm so sorry. (soft dramatic music) - Oh. ♪ Someday you'll thank me ♪ ♪ When life was not so kind ♪ ♪ I believe that you saved me ♪ ♪ And gave me peace of mind ♪ (Phil sighs) (Phil humming) ♪ I believe that you saved me ♪ ♪ And gave me peace of mind. ♪ - Oh, Julius. I have always loved you, Julius, and I will always love you, no matter what. But you (scoffs) gave up on me. Yeah. You just went ahead and just gave up on me. I need to know why. Why? Why would you give up on me? (punches smacking) (Marcia groaning) Oh God. (groaning) (sniffing) (sighing) Oh my God, I'm heartily sorry, for having offended thee and I detest all my sins because of thy just punishment. God forgive me. (sobbing) God forgive me. (sobbing) (gunshot bangs) (gentle piano music) (door clicking) - Well, you're out of luck, boy. You ain't getting shit. What the fuck? (Stan yelling) (punch smacking) (Julius groaning) - I won't let you kill me. - Take it easy. - What, just like you did with me? - Are you kidding me? (punch smacking) (glass smashing) (punches thwacking) (Stan groaning) (Julius grunting) I did not wanna kill you, I just wanna know the truth. - The truth, you'll never know. - Did you kill my daughter? - I loved your daughter. - Who, who took my baby? - I don't know the answer, I don't know the end of this story. - I hate you! I hate you. - Julius Fonteneau, I forgive you, but I pray you burn in hell. (Stan screaming) (ominous music) (eyeball flesh ripping) (Stan groaning) (Stan coughing) (Stan screaming) - [Stan] No, no. God, no. (Stan coughing) No, God, God. (light bulb glass smashing) - You did it. You finally fucking did it. Amen, brother. It had to be done. You had to do what you did. I'll clean up, okay? I'll take care of the body. You get yourself together. (laughs) Fuck, yeah. (soft orchestral music) - How did this all happen to me, Lord? Now you've gotten to see how I feel. For four months, now, my life has been one continuous torment, one continuous torture, the torture of not knowing. But now I've found peace. Now, I know. I've come to believe, through all this, we make our own heaven. (flame roaring) (dramatic music) But today, we're all burning in hell. (dramatic choral music) (flames crackling) (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh. Okay, thank you. (car keys jangling) (car engine starting) (soft, grave music) (police siren wailing rapidly) (police siren wailing) (Joel sobbing) - God is with you. - No! No! No, no, no! (garage door clattering) - Miss Fonteneau, I guess your daddy will never know who killed you. (somber orchestral music)
