"We cannot always find the things we are looking for But sometimes, when we stop looking... ...those things come looking for us" Pod! Mark my words If you ever get a job in Bangkok... ...you'll wake up the next morning... ...with a tail wagging out of your ass! Ha! Ha! Ha! "Pod, a man without a dream" This is Pod, our hero Pod is your average country bumpkin... ...the kind of guy we won't waste your time trying to describe All his life, Pod has made the wrong decisions For example, when he wants to switch on the fan... ...he'll plug in the iron instead And when he wants to iron his clothes... ...it's a cinch he'll plug in the fan Moving to Bangkok was a bad decision too That's when things really started getting strange "Citizen Dog" "Before the sky had turned to blue Before the sun began to shine Before the flowers starting blooming Before sweet dreams set me free My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on Before the stars had filled the sky Before I knew my life's worth Before my heart lost faith Before my final breath ran out My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on In a world that's oh so cold... "Dog and Helmet Brand Tinned Sardines" Pod works in a sardine-canning factory It's his job to cut off the sardine's heads... ...and pack them in cans on a conveyor belt Everyday, Pod has to work faster and faster Faster And faster He can't believe the citizens of the world... ...could possibly be consuming sardines so fast Pod has a few compulsive habits He enjoys tapping his index finger... ...when he's got nothing else to do And he often feels that the food on other people's plates... ...looks much more mouth-watering than his own One day, the air-conditioning shuts down Overcome by the heat, the supervisor accidentally sets... ...the conveyor belt to run at maximum speed The workers have never been forced to work so fast Before he realizes what's happened... ...Pod's finger has been sealed in a can... ...packed in crate... ...loaded on a truck... ...and speed off down the Expressway The truck stops at a market and the can are put on a shelf Following his accident, Pod makes daily trips to the market... ...looking for his finger After a long separation, Pod is finally reunited with his finger Lucky for him, it still had that nervous habit of tapping... ...when there was nothing else to do Hey, you wanna get us killed? What do you mean? If you don't wanna die, stop poking your finger in my ribs It tickles! Shortly thereafter, Pod starts to suspect... ...that the finger he found might not really be his He's right... Pod's real finger is right over there No! Hey, what do you think you're doing? Help! Help! He's trying to steal my finger! Shameless bastard! Right in broad daylight! Don't you have one of your own? "Yod, the finger-buddy" Yod works at the sardine factory with Pod Yod believes that... ...while we can't always find the things we're looking for... ...if we'd just stop looking for them... ...they'd probably come looking for us Like the way Yod's finger came back to him And how, though they say good friends are hard to find... ...it was Yod's new friend Pod who came looking for him Look Pod... ...the thing is, somebody's finger ends up in a can every day The lucky ones manage to get them back, but some never do Some of them end up with their fingers swapped... ...just like me and you That's why I've stopped eating canned sardines I'm afraid I'll eat someone else's finger! "I've no desire to leave you Let's stay together forever..." Pod quits his job Yod does too. Because he'd never want to swap fingers... ...with anyone other than Pod Pod gets a new job as a security guard for a large company Everyday, Pod has to take the elevator to the top floor Pod gets nervous every time whenever he rides with someone else Except when he's riding with... Jin "Jin, a woman chasing her dream" Jin is a maid at the same company Jin is different from the other maids She's obsessed with cleaning... ...and can't stand the sight of the tiniest speck of dirt Jin has a few compulsive habits of her own She likes eating fried rice with basil... ...but she always picks out the basil before she eats the rice She's also got a mania for absolute orderliness The other maids regard Jin as a misfit... ...carrying that mysterious white book around with her all the time ...even though it's written in a language she doesn't understand... ...and she can't read a single word Jin got the book when she was still living in the country It just fell out of the sky one day From that day on, Jin's life began to change She believes that the book has chosen her... ...that it wants to tell her something She's been trying to read it ever since The white book changed her life so much... ...that Jin decided to move to Bangkok... ...to look for the meaning of the book she can never read Don't be discouraged, Plub Plueng The Count doesn't despise you I'm sure one day he'll see how good you are... ...and you'll find happiness with the Count During breaks... ...Pod often sees Jin talking to the characters in romance magazines The other maids think Jin's a nutcase "Why did you leave me..." But Pod sees the other maids crying for the women on radio soap operas, just like Jin They look the way children do when they're talking to their dolls Love is torment, Plub Plueng... The difference is that Jin's voice is so lovely... ...and there's a sparkle that comes into her eyes as she reads And the way she shakes her right leg when she's happy Everything Jin does seems magical to Pod You'll be awake all night... ...drinking so much coffee like that It's true, Pod doesn't sleep that night But it's not the coffee Everywhere Pod looks, all he can see is Jin's face Even his fried rice looks like Jin Pod dares not eat it, afraid he might be eating Jin alive Nor does he dare close his eyes... ...afraid he might lose sight of Jin's face So Pod doesn't eat anything, and he doesn't sleep a wink The next morning, Pod tries not to look at Dang, his dog He dreads seeing Jin's face on it What happened to you? You're as pale as a dead man That's because I'm dead! "Kong... motorcycle-taxi ghost!" Kong tells Pod about the day it rained so hard... ...that helmets started falling from the sky Kong was killed on the spot But because he loved his job so much... ...Kong returned to work... ...unable to leave his beloved motorbike Looks like it might rain again today Wait for me. Wait! That was the day that Pod spoke to Jin for the first time Though she isn't really much of a talker... ...Jin doesn't mind talking to Pod Besides, no one else would talk to Jin Pod decides to tell Jin a story he's never told anyone before Only special people have tails Celebrities, singers, politicians, rich people... ...or those who graduated from schools overseas Only they have tails. Ordinary folks like you and me haven't got a chance But my Grandma warned me that... ...if I ever got a job in Bangkok, I'd surely grow a tail You haven't grown one yet, have you? If you think you're going to grow a tail, you're dreaming Don't you know what a dream is? Well, take me for example. I dream of being able to read this book one day That's my dream. Though I still can't read this book ...I know that one day my dream will be fulfilled The day when I'm able to read this book... then I'll really be a special person I might even grow a tail like those celebrities It might be impossible right now Pod doesn't have a clue what Jin's babbling about But now he knows there's a difference between people... ...who live for their dreams, and those who live without "Dreams"? He must have been listening to Jin! Ridiculous! Dreaming... what nonsense! If someone told me I had to buy a dream... ...or a story about a gut-sucking ghost... ...I'd stick with the ghost Why's that? Back in my village, lots of folks have seen a gut-sucking ghost... ...but who's ever seen a dream? Only dreamers! Nobody buys that stuff You can't believe anything that girl says. She's nuts You see that book she carries around with her? The other day she went around asking everyone to tell her what was written in it But nobody knew She even asked the boss He just flipped the pages back and forth and shook his head He's a foreigner and even he couldn't read it! For those maids, a country girl carrying a book she couldn't read... ...was just about the oddest thing they'd ever seen Not too long after that... ...Jin realizes Bangkok isn't just a city of signs and shopping malls It's got a lot of language schools as well That's where everyone goes to learn new languages So Jin goes too But after a few weeks at the school... ...Jin still hadn't learned the words she wanted to read Plub Plueng has run away... Without Plub Plueng, I've lost my will to live Plub Plueng was the reason I kept believing that one day my life would get better Now what am I supposed to do? Hmm. If Plub Plueng is the heroine... ...then the only one who can bring her back... ...is the hero Count! Count! Why have you called me here? "The Count and Plub Plueng" Pod starts to believe that maybe gut-sucking ghosts really do exist The women in the radio operas, too Maybe dolls really do talk to children And even though he'd believed that story about the tail... and he'd seen a lot of weird things since moving to the city... ...he started thinking that Bangkok had its good points too I'm headed home so... bye Jin... wait Er... You look really nice in your blue dress Are you nuts? I wear this blue dress every day. As if you've never seen it before... The sight of Jin in blue that day seemed so captivating to Pod... ...even though it was the only color he'd ever seen her wear With Jin in that blue maid's uniform... ...Pod felt as if he could gaze at her forever "I dream of a lady in a blue dress I cannot sleep, longing to see that blue dress once again Who bought that dress for you? I've fallen for that dress I long to wash it clean You're as bright as the stars at night In that dress as blue as the moon My heart skips a beat Might I borrow your blue dress To keep me warm on cold and lonely nights? Catching a glimpse of your dress My heart pounds for days I'd love to touch it I promise not to crumple it And if I do, please take it off And let me iron it for you..." Pod has no idea how to express the things he's feeling Then Yod introduces him to Muay "Muay, the Emperor's daughter" Muay is a young Thai-Chinese woman... ...who believes she's a descendant of an Emperor If she were in China, she'd surely be a princess But here in Bangkok... ...she gets by as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant In her slinky Chinese dress... ...Muay is the best-looking waitress they've got Whenever a customer compliments Muay on her looks... ...she always tells them it's because of her imperial blood Muay first met Yod on a bus packed tighter than a tin of sardines Squeeze in folks! You heard me... squeeze on in! Squeeze on in! You too, Aunty... squeeze it in! Squeeze in any tighter and we'll be husband and wife! That's just what happened to Yod and Muay... They became husband and wife right there on the bus From that day on... ...they'd only ride on jam-packed buses... ...just so they could squeeze together again They began collecting bus tickets as souvenirs Muay said that the more ticket they had... ...the more they love each other Pod, why don't you start collecting bus tickets too... and we'll see who can get the most? Jin... - Yes? Shall we take the bus home together? I can't I'm allergic to buses Let's take the Skytrain instead Pod was disappointed that the Skytrain wasn't as packed as a bus But he was delighted to take Jin home just the same He prayed that Jin lived far, far away. He wanted to spend all day with her "Before the sky had turned to blue... Before the sun began to shine Before the flowers starting blooming Before sweet dreams set me free My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes..." I break out in a rash whenever I take the bus I get it from the Skytrain too, but not as much Even if I take the Skytrain every day... ...the rashes never clear up I think... ...I just wasn't born to take a bus One day... when I have my own car... ...I'd probably feel better And maybe these crazy rashes will stop tormenting me They itch like mad For Pod, Jin was such a fragile creature... ...that those little rashes seem like barbaric wounds on her arms Pod began to feel even more like scratching Jin's arms... ...than squeezing together with her on a bus This is my house You live here? -Yes My rent's only 500 baht a month I wonder if the Count has found Plub Plueng Would Plub Plueng mind if she knew that my house is so shabby? If Plub Plueng's really your friend, she won't look down on you It's getting late, so... Thanks for taking me home Pod realizes that the only way to conquer Jin's rashes... ...is to drive her around in a car But how can he get a car? The next day Pod resigns from the company... ...and takes a job as a taxi driver Driving the taxi helps Pod get closer to Jin... though she's still indifferent to his feelings But seeing Jin's unblemished arms... ...helps keep Pod's hopes high "Mam, a girl... or a woman?" I'm 22 years old why shouldn't I be allowed to smoke? But most adults treat me like a child My parents are the worst... cooing at me all the time... as if I were on 8-year-old Can you believe that my mom still makes bottles of powdered milk for me? It's true. Don't believe it? See? So, uh, young lady, where would you like to go? To the mall And don't call me "young lady." That's so irritating! While I'm in there, take care of Thongchai for me, okay? Who'd believe that... ...a cute little Teddy Bear like me would be smoking like a chimney? Why's this seat so fucking high! Shit! Sorry to smoke in your car, bro. I can't help myself After living with Baby Mam for 20 years... ...it's a habit I just can't quit Are you really going to wait for her? I bet she'll take all day You'd have time to go home, take a shower... go bang some hooker, and still be back before she's done Thongchai tells Pod that... Baby Mam comes to play computer games at the mall every day Her favourite is a shoot'em up. She can't get enough of it Thongchai says that Mam's house is too quiet She needs to get out and play computer games every day She's become addicted to loud noise But now that Mam's started going out every day... ...her parents have stopped speaking to her Now she's got no one else to talk to I'm the only friend she's got I'm sure Mam's parents mean well If they're worried about her playing those games with guns... ...it's only because they're afraid she'll become a violent person What a load of crap! They're totally over-reacting! Baby Mam may like to play bloody video games But she'd faint on the spot if she ever saw a drop of real blood What a joke! Thongchai! What have I told you about talking behind my back? Baby Mam, I... uh... Pod doesn't really understand the relationship between Mam and Thongchai But he hates seeing a little girl who doesn't know how old she is... fighting with her Teddy Bear in the back of his cab Many times, Mam's dumped Thongchai out on the road But she always goes back to rescue him Thongchai! I'm sorry. I won't leave you again They're not crying because they've had a fight They're feeling sorry for themselves for not having other people to talk to Pod thinks that... ...maybe someone has stolen all of their friends... ...to teach the two of them a lesson... ...about the meaning of love Tell her you love her, before it's too late What are you saying? Tell Jin you love her before it's too late You never know when it's going to start raining helmets again Pod agrees with Kong Not that he needs to buy a helmet... ...but that the time to tell Jin he loves her has finally come How could two poor people like Pod and Jin get married? We'd never be able to give our children tails Dreams either I couldn't stand that A life without dreams And I don't want my children to blame me... for giving them a life without dreams That would be even crueler than not giving them tails Pod! Pod! Don't remember me, huh? Ungrateful little shit! Moves to Bangkok and forgets all about his Granny "When I died, they set me on fire They spread my ashes in the river... ...and catfish gobbled them up A farmer caught the fish and grilled it up for dinner His kids stuffed themselves, ate it all but the bones When they got the runs, they took a dump in the field Then the rains came down and soaked into the ground Fertilizing the rice paddies with the run-off of men Hungry grasshoppers swooped down on the fields And they ended up in the farmer's net Tough luck for them, they got fried in a pan Young people like to eat'um, snacking from a bag When the geckos saw it, they stuffed themselves too Oh! The chaos of reincarnation No one knows how the whole thing began But when the egg was hatched, you little brat... ...out came your Granny in a brand new form! And that's the story Believe me yet? Grandma? At last he remembers me Now, I want you to get these silly thoughts out of your head I'll be seeing you Grandma? - What is it now? Don't worry, I'm not going far I'll just be catching bugs here in your room But who knows? Tomorrow I might be reborn as something else If I see you again I'll tell you about it I gotta go now After turning down Pod's confession of love Jin meets someone who'll change her life again "Peter... the activist" Jin doesn't really know what the foreigner's name is She calls him Peter... ...because that's the only foreign name she knows No matter who he is, Jin's sure he's the one... ...who will help her solve the mystery of the white book "Yesterday in Washington D.C. Activists staged a protest against the construction of a chemical factory... claiming that environmental damage would result The protesters clashed with the police, leading to multiple arrests..." Jin becomes convinced that... ...Peter was one of the activists in the news And that the white book must have something to do with his environmental beliefs The police probably don't share Peter's beliefs Neither did Jin's boss Jin realizes she'll have to be more careful... and not go around showing the book to just anyone Take me to The Nameless Island. Sorry... where to? The Nameless Island Don't you know it? What is this... your first day on the job? Come on, let's get going Tik's lost all his memories except for one: His name... Tik Tik likes taking taxis But he can never remember where he wants to go He just says "Take me The Nameless Island" All the cabbies just drop him off right where they picked him up Tik has a disgusting habit: He likes to lick everything he sees Pod thinks Tik was once a man who loved sending letters... but that he once licked a poisonous stamp... ...and it left him an amnesiac Pod doesn't know where to take Tik... ...so he takes Tik home with him Soon Pod's room is squeaky clean... ...thanks to Tik's restless tongue Tik says his licking is a statement of love... ...but Pod doesn't want his face washed that often Pod, just let me lick you a little bit Pod takes Tik with him when he goes to work... ...hoping one of his passengers will recognise him But nobody does Most of them jump out of the cab after a minute or two Crazy bastard! Are you descended from dogs or what? One day, Tik disappears without a trace "Peter" "Yesterday in Washington D.C., activists staged a protest rally against the building of a new chemical factory..." Jin sees a report on the news... ...that an activist was shot during a protest She's not sure, but she fears that Peter was involved "Your horoscope this month predicts that... the movements of Venus and Saturn... ...may have dire consequences for someone dear to you" Jin becomes convinced that Peter is dead Though she's sad to think she'll never see him again... she's glad that knowing about Peter has taught her something new about life We can all play a part in saving the world The Greenhouse Effect has caused rising global temperatures One day the polar ice-caps will melt and we'll all be drowned Why is this happening? Because we overuse plastic bottles, plastic bags... ...foam boxes, and other plastic products We should all be recycling plastic bottles... ...to reduce the amount of garbage on the planet Remember, no more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! "If I were as free as a bird My wings would carry me far far away I'd be a white dove Leading the way to freedom If I was a cloud in the sky I'd bring shade to cool the fields If I were a grain of sand I'd join other grains to make a paths for the masses I'd give up my life for the cause..." We all have to do our part by recycling plastic bags It's essential that we conserve our environmental resources We have to give meaning to Peter's death Peter? Yes, Peter's spirit can rest easy knowing his cause isn't lost Pod... pull over! See, plastic is poisoning the world Pod contributed to Peter's death when you ordered fried rice in foam boxes... ...and noodles in plastic bags From now on, I'll never touch plastic again Luckily, Pod's car isn't made of plastic... ...or Jin might never ride with him again Pod feels sad knowing that Jin had a lover named Peter... and he's glad that Peter's already dead But knowing that Jin hasn't forgotten Peter... ...makes Pod sad all over again He wonders if suicide might be the answer after all But he's afraid he'll see his Grandma's face again Jin, are you OK? Aren't you going to work today? I quit that job already I wanted to have more time to save the world Peter would be glad... ...knowing someone is taking up where he left off I'm just sorry I can't save the world all by myself There's just too many people overusing plastic to stop them all So where are you going now? To march in another demonstration Let me give you a ride That's okay... I'll walk It'll help conserve the world's energy supplies Pod feels Jin drifting away from him It's like she's living in another world... ...one that Pod knows nothing about Muay... has gone... Yod tells Pod that Muay has gone back to China She decided an emperor's daughter like her... shouldn't associate with commoners anymore... ...and that she's tired of squeezing onto a crowded buses with Yod But Yod can't stop thinking about Muay He starts taking a Chinese language course Muay! I... miss... you... Muay... come... back... Yod believes that if Muay still loves him... ...she'll hear his cries all the way in china But will she understand his terrible Chinese accent? Muay... "Thongchai's Tragic Tale" Thongchai tells Pod... about the mobile phone Baby Mam got as a birthday present Ever since she's got it, all she does is talk to her phone Thongchai was abandoned like a worn-out old appliance Then one day, he was dumped out with the trash Mam, how could you do this to me? Thongchai became a homeless Teddy bear Each night he stares at the sky and dreams of Baby Mam Did you get my smokes? Pod tries to help Thongchai to be happy... ...hoping that one day he'll be happy with Jin as well He's glad to know that at least someone truly loves Mam Hello? Hey Pod, take a look at this tree I'm potting Come on in and have a seat All the activists have started planting trees Plants and trees are the only things that will help us save the world So, what kind of tree is that? I'm not really sure, just a tree But let me show you my favourite tree It's a Peter Tree The Peter Tree will help us fight the war against plastic But Jin, that's just a corn plant No. It's my Peter Tree Where are you off to now? To the demonstration. I go everyday If I stop going, the world will just sustain more damage I'm afraid we won't be able to save the world in time Excuse me, is this Jin's house? No more plastic! No more plastic! Jin, Plub Plueng's come back! Jin, Plub Plueng came back! See, the Count has brought Plub Plueng back I've got no time for that nonsense now I've found my mission in life Now, I've got to go. I have to catch up with the group No more plastic! No more plastic! Now that Jin's stopped riding with him... ...Pod sees no reason to keep driving a taxi Pod still waits for Jin every day, but Jin never comes back The heap of plastic bottles in front of her house... has become the size of a mountain Jin... Where are you? Jin... Where are you? Muay... where are you? I miss Muay so much Whenever I run into a group of Chinese tourists... I ask them to take bus tickets back to Muay, so she'll know I miss her I don't think she ever gets them though There must be a few million Muays in China What about you, Pod? I haven't seen Jin for a long time now She's left home to go to these demonstrations and never seems to come back I even don't know where to look for her It's like I told you before The more you look for something... the more hopeless you're likely to feel But if you stop looking and stay put... maybe Jin will come looking for you You little shit! Running after your fucking daddy or what?! Dad! Dad, where have you been? Are you OK? Let me take you home Even though he misses Jin so much he can barely stand it... Pod decides to do what Yod advised He stays put And sure enough, he finally sees Jin again "I think plastic was invented to destroy the environment But plants are just the opposite. They're beautiful And they help to keep the world clean If plants are the heroes... ...plastic is the villain We must rid the world of plastic! Thank you That's a comment from a demonstrator at today's rally against The march is now moving into Silom Road" Taxi? Can't you go any faster? You asked for it... No more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! No more plastic! And just at that moment... ...Jin saw the man she'd thought was already dead No more plastic! No more plastic! Peter... wait! I'm so happy you're still alive Peter, you've changed my life so much Because of you... I've joined the cause for building a better world Whenever I'm desperate about the state of our planet... ...I think about you how much you've sacrificed for your cause Look at this tree, Peter. I carry it with me everywhere I've named it the Peter Tree You're an inspiration to me I think you've misunderstood My name's not Peter. It's Andre. Andre? Yeah. And this is a... corn plant, not a "Peter Tree" Wait! No more plastic! No more plastic! You have got a book just like this one, don't you? Peter, you're the only person I know who can read it... ...and I've waited so long to find out what's written inside You really want to know? No more plastic! No more plastic! Jin! Jin? When Peter... or Andre... tells Jin that the white book is actually a pornographic Italian novel... ...about a homosexual tryst... ...Jin's world comes crashing down She never mentions the white book again She stops going out and refuses to speak to anyone Not even Pod "What I see is all have Sometimes real, sometimes false Sometimes strong, sometimes weak Sometimes fragrant, sometimes filthy I have only these two eyes And all I see is filth and waste Other people look far and wide And gaze into the stars But I just can't see the dazzling lights Of all those stars so bright Still I'm happy deep inside I can see the stars within the filth" That day, Jin sees the white book again She thinks it must be looking for another innocent girl's life to ruin... ...just like it ruined hers "What I see is all I have All that's false, all that's true" I... I want to stay away from you for a while Jin wants to stay away from Pod for a while Jin wants to stay away from Pod for a while Unable to see Jin... ...Pod decides to go back home for a while Everything seems to move so slowly there Pod... ...finally come back home, huh? His dad says everything just seems slow... ...because Pod's been in Bangkok so long The clocks in Bangkok run faster than the ones in the country Pod just needs time to readjust But days later... ...Pod still feels like the world's moving in slow motion It's torture It takes him half a day just to let out a sigh of longing for Jin So Pod decides to go back to Bangkok He wants to tell Jin that it's OK if she doesn't love him... ...but he never wants her to tell him to stay away from her again He can't stand missing her so much "Bangkok, City of People with Tails" Since Pod's been away, Bangkok has changed a lot Having a tail is no longer considered special Now everyone in Bangkok's got a tail... ...even if they keep them hidden So Pod has become special after all... since he's the only boy in Bangkok... ...who doesn't have a tail Is that Pod? Yes, yes. That's him! Pod! Pod! Please let me feel your ass How do you account for your-tail-free status? "Pod... the man without a tail" "Though it seems unbelievable... ...there's still a man in Bangkok who doesn't have a tail According to reports, the man... Pod... was born tail-less..." Who's there? It's me, Yod So, you're quite the celebrity now Let me take a good look at you You haven't changed one bit Same cheap clothes Same not-so-handsome face And you don't even have a tail! Don't tell me you've grown a tail too Of course I have And a long one it is I have to stuff it way down in my pants or it'll come waggling out It's completely obscene Hey Pod, we've been friends for a long time now Can I ask you a favour? What is it? I've forgotten what an ass without a tail even looks like Would you let me... feel yours? Are you crazy? Come on, just once. Nobody will see us Yod... no! Come on, just a quick grope No! Knock that off! Listen. Have you heard anything about Jin? Jin? Why, yes. I've heard something... Want to know what it is? I'll share it with you... ...if you let me touch your ass a little Desperate for news about Jin, Pod grants Yod his wish Yod tells him that Jin has grown a tail too She tried to cut it off several times but didn't succeed Unfortunately for Pod, Yod doesn't know where Jin is... and Bangkok is too big to just go out and start looking for her "Every night and every day Every night and every day I can make it through lonely nights and days Because of you Because of a dream so out of reach I should have known that those dreams were illusions Illusions I made for myself They were the hope that kept me going Through those nights and days I could make it through lonely nights and days Because of you Because of those sweet dreams I should have known that those dreams were illusions Illusions I made for myself..." Jin! Pod? I must have changed a lot so you couldn't recognize me No... ...In fact, you haven't changed at all You either You still look so pretty in your blue dress No, I've changed a lot... unlike you You're famous now Your arms... No more rashes. They went away when I got my own car But I'm not really used to it yet When I've got an itch, there's nothing for me to scratch Jin, I've been thinking... ...there are too may bad things in life... ...so many sad things... so many that we become blind to all the good things that we have in our lives My feelings for you have never changed Even if you still like to spend hours mopping the floor... or shaking your leg when you're happy... ...or picking the basil out of your fried rice... ...even if you want to dream... ...or want to have a tail... ...everything you do is still magic for me And at the very moment... ...Jin feels herself as happy as when she's shaking her leg But she doesn't need to shake her leg The happiness she'd been trying to find... ...through having a tail, or a dream... or learning to read that white book Really, it's the same feeling... ...that's been with Jin ever since the day she first met Pod But because she never stopped looking for it... ...she was never able to see that it was already there But if we get married, you'll grow a tail, and... and you'll become an ordinary person like the rest of us... ...and our children will have tails, and... And from that moment on... Bangkok never saw another person who didn't have a tail "Six Months Later" Pod and Jin's happiness together... finally convinced Yod to forget Muay... ...and give himself another chance And when they learned that... there was no one else in the world they wanted to talk to... Thongchai and Baby Mam decided to get married too They continue to talk happily ever after The Mountain of Plastic has become a popular Bangkok spot Young lovers come here... and leave behind plastic bottles as monuments of their love The Mountain now reaches all the way up to the moon After marrying Pod, Jin started working in a plastic bottle factory She was so hard-working that she was soon promoted to management But Jin tries hard to be a lousy manager She wants the factory to lose money... ...so that eventually it will be forced to shout down She sees her job as the fastest way to save the world Pod likes to argue that plastic will never disappear from the earth and that people will keep on ordering fried rice in foam boxes But he understands that this is Jin's dream... and he starts having his own dream, too Let me tell you about my past lives Once, I was born as a dinosaur Pod dreams that his dead grandmother... ...after coming back as a gecko... ...was reborn again and again In her last life, she was a pig... and she ended up as a plate of pork fried rice that Jin ate before Now she's somewhere deep inside Jin's womb See you in three months! Grandma? "Before the sky had turned to blue Before the sun began to shine Before the flowers starting blooming Before sweet dreams set me free My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on Before the stars had filled the sky Before I knew my life's worth Before my heart lost faith Before my final breath ran out My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on In a world that's oh so cold..." My heart and my soul Belong to you I promise on my life That I'll always keep fighting for you My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes My heart was empty Till you took mercy on me And gave me strength to carry on" My heart was hollow Until your love came in... ...and opened my eyes "Goodbye"
