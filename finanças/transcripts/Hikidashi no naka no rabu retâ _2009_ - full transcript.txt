Please come again It's really nice! So cute! Manager, he's here again I'm not a... Looking for something? No Mother Why didn't you tell me? I wasn't trying to hide it I shouldn't have raised you to be so independent What's that mean? You know, nothing would surprise me So tell me who the father is We don't think the same way Marriage can happen any time But there is a time limit to having children That's why... What are you saying? Who's the father? Well, I wonder who it is Yuri! One parent is enough Can we drink today? Great! They have a good wine list Welcome I'm sorry, but only counter seats are available Okay? Sure Is that acceptable? Yes Please be seated Thank you Sorry not to contact you No, it's my fault too A columnist wrote, When feelings are at odds resolve it quickly, but it's not easy Is that sarcasm? Mai! Kanako! Hello Hi Dinner? Sounds good. I'm with the fun Ladies Club Or the Desperate Club You have that young boyfriend We split up. Young guys are unreliable and vague We both have to find happiness when marrying at this age Don't you agree? I agree I bought this strap as a good luck charm Sorry to interrupt you See you around Full of confidence, as usual Let's order You're a lively one! Don't surprise me! And you like working? What the...? Lousy driver! I'm very sorry You're not from Tokyo. I see it in your face Right You're driving in circles! I'll turn into a donut! Let me out! I'm sorry Just 2,000 yen is fine Obviously! I won't pay more! I'm sorry. I'm running there now! Express Service! I'm very sorry! If you don't know streets, learn to use GPS! I'm on my way! I'm sorry Good, you're still awake How's Shota? Is he sleeping? I tried to call by 9:30 P.M., but was too busy Huh? What's that mean? I work at this lousy job for you! If it's so bad, I won't call again! Do I seem to lack confidence? Huh? I don't think so You think too much and hide your feelings but that's just who you are Mai, did something happen with your father? Well, the memorial of his passing No, not really I see I have a business trip to Shanghai next week I may transfer for 2 or 3 years If that happens, will you go with me? What do you intend to do? You're almost 30. Be responsible, come home Find a nice partner, like Miki Marriage is a woman's happiness Stop fooling around and be responsible Fooling around? Since junior high I followed my dream, I'm heard on radio... Can you do that job until 40 or 50? You can't make a living from a dream Mai? Sorry, I can't I see I'm sorry It's okay, it's not decided that I'll go And you have a job In TV dramas you often hear " I'll make you happy" but if they can make you happy won't they just naturally do it without saying so? On the other hand, those that can't make loved ones happy surely cannot make anyone happy Big sister's home She'll relax here for a while I knew you'd run back home Dad! I told you it would happen What's that mean? Your dream wasn't worth much Dad, stop that Must be nice to run home whenever you're tired Dad! Enough! Sister, had lunch? Let's... I made my dream come true, but... I tried! Don't make excuses! Dad! Can't you say something kind? Are you listening? Can't you... Sister! What's wrong? Eat up I have something to say About what, the hospital? It's not that I... I want to marry her That older lady? Her again? Don't talk about that, it's settled Won't you at least meet her? Just once, please meet her I sincerely ask you Will a woman over 30 with a job and her own life make you and this hospital a priority over herself? You must be able to understand at least that Focus just on work for 2-3 years then I'll find you someone That's not necessary Leave it to your father. You don't need to worry about it Everything has worked out well so far Don't worry Why are you here? I talked to your Dad. I'll stay here until it's born No, I'm okay on my own You can't do it yourself It's tough even after it's born Someone should be here when you bath the baby My company is doing well, I can afford help Such services are common now You're so stubborn You're the stubborn one If you want me to leave, contact the baby's father I don't know who it is That's not true It is true I'm your mother I know such things You should contact the father If he really loves you, he would want to know It's not so simple Mom, do you want to hurt me? Please, just leave! Mai! Naoki Hayami? It's Class 2 Hayami! Wonder if Grandpa smiled? Maybe Thanks! Ms Mai Kubota thank you for everything However sorry, but... please stop gathering ideas It led to Dad and Grandpa arguing Grandpa collapsed it's not the right time to make him smile I'm sorry to request this after all your efforts I look forward to your program I'm sorry to have troubled you "How to Make Grandpa Smile" going okay? What do you think? I want your opinion! Even a late starter can't always ask others clearly state your own opinion! Begin to realize that being distinctive could make you a top program host I've had an old radio since junior high Dad gave it to me for English study but I just enjoyed listening to other things I wonder if my voice is heard by others Kubota, you're a good host What's wrong? I shouldn't have asked for " How to Make Grandpa Smile" Why is that? It doesn't resolve matters Resolve? Things like making someone smile was not what was required I always get things wrong Don't drink so much Um... I'm sorry To be honest, Mai... Ms Kubota, I don't know much about you I became a listener recently. My classmates like you So why, that... That's fine Did you take the trouble to visit because of my letter? I didn't intend to blame you That's fine, too I regret the simplistic suggestion of making Grandpa smile So why did you come all the way? Your Dad and Grandpa don't get along, right? Right Do you mind if I ask you why? I'm not sure, but think it's about my Grandma Your Grandma? Seems Grandma left when Dad was four years old, but I don't know Why do you ask? Grandpa! Are you okay? Come in Thank you She's my acquaintance. Actually, a Tokyo radio host Come in I'm Mai Kubota From Tokyo? Please excuse my appearance Would you like tea? Please don't bother. Sorry to trouble you Grandpa, I'll make tea So, what brings you here? I came to apologize Naoki sent me a postcard and on my program I requested ideas to make you smile Because of that... Naoki wanted you and his Dad to get along better and sent the postcard, right? I thought perhaps I could help You don't need to be concerned about it A conflict with your son There is none Maybe radio people have to exaggerate things for interest but don't meddle in my family affairs just for fun! Please leave! I understand Sorry to have intruded Excuse me I'm sorry I regret writing that postcard What's up? You again Your girlfriend? Stop that! Hello. I'm Naoki's stand in Uncle, Urabe Hello Will you join me for tea? Get out of here! You're not my stand in uncle! Hey, don't say that, Naoki! Sure, let's have tea Really? See! See! This way please. You stay here! My truck is just a two seater As for my character people around here refer to me as " Urabe the Know All" but of course that's not really Is that so? Wait! It's not impossible He's like that at first This often happens With the Guarantor Guarantor? Kyozo is stubborn, but he is kind hearted A man asked Kyozo for help and he foolishly signed for him The man took off and Kyozo was stuck with his debt Kyozo is bad tempered His wife put up with him for a while but it was too tough for a high class woman from Tokyo She came here from Tokyo? She loved jazz, so came to this place often She brought Kyozo with her, they were so close Hard to believe he hit her and she ran away Hit her? Just a rumor! Never mention this to Kyozo, okay? He would fly into a rage Megumi, don't tell anyone Okay Of course I don't believe he would hit a woman As Kenichi became older, he had trouble with his father also That matter came up but Kyozo isn't the type to explain or make excuses, and kept it inside That made things worse Since then they've become even more distant They should both talk more frankly In that respect, I freely say what I want That's my Latin blood! It's so difficult What is? Parents and children It's because of that because they don't eat together They'd meet when eating, even if they hated it Somehow things might improve It probably just needs a little nudge To my daughter, struggling alone in Tokyo I was a terrible father who never said a kind word to you but I am filled with pride that you're pursuing your dream I've been encouraged many times when hearing your words on the radio I think you do wonderful work Please believe in yourself and don't give up Take care of... your health From your Father "Miss Mai Kubota" Any more questions? Please give further consideration to the title of the program Then each department will evaluate it Okay, Director? That's fine That concludes our meeting Let's go eat! Sure! Can I have a moment? What's up? I have a plan for a new project How to Make Grandpa Smile 2! Be quiet! A Kubota project? Yes Please wait, everyone Thoughts From the Drawer? Please pass these around Sir Everyone has thoughts they wanted to express, but didn't I want to gather those thoughts to present in a program Families or lovers that don't talk, and their relations fell apart To express those unexpressed words, something is needed, a nudge This program would be that something But to work, the one they want to reach has to hear the program I think that's okay Radio really has a special power It seems more one to one than TV So it's easier to express things Thoughts they wanted to express, but couldn't Right Of course The opposite of our modern world, where everything's too frank. Great! Thank you However the title is not so good Well, let me see We'll call it " Love Letters From the Drawer" Only for love letters? Love letters aren't addressed only to lovers Letters to family, friends, even to mentors are wonderful love letters! Yes! But who should we have as the host? Please let me do it! Can you handle it? I think I can Please let me do it Well then, you are in charge, Ms Kubota Yes! "Love Letters From the Drawer ", Not bad at all It is good! Don't push it Are there things you haven't expressed That thank you to someone dear to you that you live apart from Or if close by, that sorry you're too embarrassed to say And there are times when you can't find the right words to say Don't you also have words deep in your heart that you want to express? Holiday special, " Love Letters From the Drawer" will gather those words held in the drawer of your heart Write down those thoughts, send that letter with a related song I hope to receive lots of love letters Leave a message after the tone This is Kubota. Did you hear my program today? I have a request Could you have Grandpa write a letter to your Dad? It's necessary for them to express their true feelings Are you worried? No You told me not to worry, so I stopped worrying Well, then? I'm happy about it I'm happy you'll have this baby Mother In the end, parents always accept what their children want I'll always be on your side All right! Today we'll get Grandma to buy you lots of things! Thank you We'll be back Thanks! I'm so happy Enough of that, some guy's watching Whenever you like Yeah! 46,500 yen! The manager's out! What'll I do? I'm your Loving Warrior! I'm sorry! Did you wait? It's fine, I suddenly asked you to come Welcome Rosehip tea. Certainly Sorry to intrude the other day, at the restaurant Oh, that? It's okay I guess things didn't go too well after that Can I assume something like that? Something like that? Daisuke is a great guy If you don't want to marry him, maybe I'd be interested Just joking But my situation is so different than yours I have few chances to express my feelings to people That's why I always say what I want to say You express yourself at work, so may feel you don't need it I don't think That isn't good for you Mai, you said that yourself Don't hold back your thoughts, you should express them He's not home That's okay, I'll wait here Sorry to bother you All right Um... I know! When Grandpa has troubles, he comes to listen to the bells Listen to the bells? Yes, at the monastery Dad I know what you mean I've invited him to move to Sapporo with us many times However he has never listened to me The scenery has changed so much Since when I was a rebellious youth and I too am a father It's beautiful We're a fishing family so I've never thought of the sea as being beautiful Dad Whether we leave here, or whether we stay here we must have strong will Forty years In the 40 years since that day my father and I have probably seen this scenery very differently Nothing can be done about it However regardless of that you also come to listen to the bells Mr Hayami, I have a request Even one line or word, something held in your heart I have no one to write a letter to After my mother passed away, my father raised me on his own I argued with him and for a long time we didn't talk, I avoided him He passed away during that time That was three months ago Without resolving things, without expressing my gratitude I should have talked to him, even if in anger I'm a fool My work involves expression in words but I said nothing to someone so important to me Mai I'm sorry You wrote your Grandpa doesn't smile, saying " Please advise me" but I had no answer It's none of your business Perhaps I'm just selfish. I'm sorry But living alone, with no connection to others must be terribly lonely Perhaps things can't change, but just expressing feeling might help I hope so, and believe it can Grandpa, write something! Nothing to write Even if you don't go to Sapporo, parting like this will ruin us Kids should be silent! But I really am worried! Shut up! Naoki I'll wait until just before I go on air "Special Program" " Love Letters From the Drawer" Mai, check these. Thanks Only 24 hours left! Tanaka! Yes?

I'm grateful to you both But from now on I can't follow the course you planned I will live my life in my own way What will you do for work?

I'll get the requested song! And now the final love letter We're almost done, but here it is It's from Kyozo, in Hokkaido To you, whom I haven't seen in 40 years Dad! How have you been? Forty years have passed since you left this house Kenichi, who was just four years old, is now aged 44 He completed college and now works for the government He married a lovely wife, and has a son in senior high school He's asking me to go live with him, regardless of the hurt I've caused It is thanks to you that he grew up to be such a kind son Every day I've thought about how much you'd have wanted to see Kenichi growing up beside you I drove you away with my foolishness robbing you of your child, and your child of his mother Every time I hear those bells while looking out to sea I think of you having to leave this town all alone Even now my heart breaks at the loneliness you must have felt Back then I thought only of myself and by the time I considered you I could no longer find you Regardless of all you did for me I didn't say a word of thanks which I deeply regret I sincerely hope that you have now found happiness The song I'll play now is Kyozo's request Smoke Gets in Your Eyes I pray that these thoughts reach her The important thoughts held in your heart can't be expressed there Even if someone important to you is living far away please muster the courage to take that first step I'm sure you can express your thoughts to them I pray that the thoughts of this evening's love letters reached their loved ones Also, to all of you who listened to this program a very sincere thank you Mother, are you crying? Seeing my grandchild's face overwhelmed me You finally became a grandmother Right. At last I am a grandmother Thank you If you and Dad hadn't met, I wouldn't have been born or this child either Mother thanks for giving me the chance to bear this child Does he resemble me? He'll be stubborn too Come on! Kohei! What are you doing here? I asked at the store Kanako Why didn't you tell me? Your parents were opposed That doesn't matter, I threw it all away If I had to choose, I knew that I'd choose you I chose only you but now I have this cute baby Excuse me, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Kohei Nakakura You probably think I'm irresponsible, but... actually I'm serious about Yuri It's all right It's fine, Daddy! I had little time to choose I'm sure I've made you unhappy so far but if you're willing to forgive me Please marry me Yes Here you are Your program gave me a real surprise I thought I'd forgotten everything but I recall even the scent of that town Saltwater and fish You've been there? Yes I thought if I remembered, it would be only painful memories But it wasn't so I recalled only the sound of the bells which was so nostalgic Thank you Not at all Actually it's a bit different than he wrote in that letter Two years after leaving that town I secretly went to meet Kenichi I intended to bring him back with me But Kenichi said he'd stay with his father Is that so? Won't you go and meet them? Just knowing that they are happy is enough However Yes? Well, If you have that program again would you mind reading this letter? A reply to the previous lefter All right, I understand I will hold on to it Hey, Naoki! You seem happy Today is special Special at your age is nothing special A girl? You can tell me Ignoring me?
