Taylor! ♪ It's a love story. Baby, just say yes ♪ Real life is a funny thing, you know. I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life and looking back, regretting the moments we didn't speak out. ♪ You belong with me... ♪ When we didn't say I love you. When we should have say I'm sorry. So there is a time for silence and there is a time for waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say, you know it. I don't think you should wait. I think you should Speak Now.

My name is Taylor. And welcome to the Speak Now World Tour. You know, I was sitting in my dressing room a little earlier today and... I heard you guys screaming through the concrete walls of this arena and I thought to myself... I thought to myself, nothing says this is going to be an amazing crowd like being able to hear them screaming through concrete walls. Man, I just... I get so fascinated standing here from this view point. It's an excellent view of everybody here tonight. And, I can see everyone. I can see the best friends who came all laid up over there. I can see you all the way up of the top with the "Swift" light-up sign. I can... And, I get... I get so fascinated by the individual stories in this room. You know I mean, I just think about the fact that you guys who made the "Long Live" sign back there. That must have taken hours. And everyone here who waited in line and piled into the same room to be here tonight. It's just so fascinating to me. And, I am so thankful because the main story of it all. The main story line here is that... Thirteen thousand five-hundred of you decided to spend your friday night with me. And I was hoping you would be alright with you if I would tell you some of my stories. Are you ready? Go!

Like for example, for me, a cello sounds sad, and a ukulele I'm playing right now, that sounds really happy, don't you think? I got this in Hawaii, a few years ago and, I've always wanted to play for you in a concert But it felt like if I was gonna play it for you, I'd have to play it on a very happy song, don't you think? You know like a song about falling in love or having a best first day of your entire life. You know things like that. Because I feel like... I feel like those things not only make you feel happy but they also make you feel... Fearless.

And then, it became something that was like a daily after-school activity. And then, it became all that I ever wanted to do. All I ever thought about, dreamed about, it became absolutely everything to me And I, thank you from the bottom of my heart for making something that means that much to me, a career path. I... I tend to write a lot of songs about love and relationships that tends to be "the main topic" covered. And... I think it's because we need music the most when we're feeling things really intensely. And I think, the most intense times in your life are when you're either falling in love or losing it. Don't you think? And I think... I think I fall into the category of the hopeless romantics and I think you do too because you're here. And see, the thing, the tricky thing about us. The tricky thing about the hopeless romantics is that, when we fall in love with someone, when we say hello, and it's magical. We never imagined that hello could someday turn into a goodbye And when we have first kiss with someone and it's magical. We never, ever... Imagine that someday that could turn into a Last Kiss.

But one thing that inspired the song was we were on our very first headlining tour, a few years ago And I used to stand there before I would go on stage and listen to the crowd, making the most amazing magical loud screaming sounds. That is the exact sound I'm talking about And I hear it and... I, first of all, I would sit there and think I can't believe I get to hear that sound one time in my life. And... And then, I would get a melody stuck in my head. And... And I could never get this melody out of my head until I finally wrote it into a song. And I called that song, "Long Live". Thank you so much for screaming for us This song is so completely a hundred percent for you.

I think... I see some of you brought things that light up But what if what if everybody who has like a cellphone or a flashlight. I don't know who carries around a flashlight. But if you do, could you put it up in the air for me? Oh, that's pretty. You know the thing... The thing about life is that every time you learn a new lesson, There is just another one right around the corner. You know, you never know everything. I think you know for me, I just kind of giving up and I'm like I know nothing compared to what I'm going to know some day And... I stopped thinking I knew everything a while ago I think last time... I thought I knew everything I was... Fifteen! Fifteen.
