(dramatic music) - BG, A-84. Yeah, listen. Give me two dimes on the Cowboys, all right? What do you mean, my credit's no good? What are you talking about? I don't understand! Yeah, all right, fine, fine. Listen, I gotta call you back, all right? - Put it there. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Don't be stupid, Jim. There's no place to go. - I know, I'm sorry. I'm just having a little trouble getting it together. - It's light. - It's a lot of money. It's tough to come up with. - It wasn't a lot of money when you bet it. - I kind of got carried away, I guess. - I asked you if you could afford it. What did you say? - I don't remember. I was a little buzzed, I guess. - You said, "No problem." - [Jim] I said that? - You said that. - You're late. You gotta pay a penalty. Get the money today, okay? - [Jim] Right, today. - Oh, and Jim? You have a nice walk home. - Walk?

(groaning) - Hey, champ. How about a cold one? - You could have helped me out instead of buying me a beer. - What, and ruin this shirt? Cost me a 150 bucks. It's one of a kind. Hey, you know, you looked great. You could turn pro. I've got this fantastic evening set up for us, brought to you by yours truly. - Is this gonna be another one of those nights like in Barstow where we spent a week in jail? - Hey, forget about that. It's at this rich guy's house. He's having this party. My cousin Jeff got us in. Let's get out of here, man. - Bar, it's been a pleasure. - Okay, guys. Stay out of trouble. - [Dale] Thanks, B. (waves crashing) (slow bluesy music) I'm just gonna get cleaned up a minute. I'll grab you a beer while you're waiting, huh? (seagulls squawking) Hey! - [Matt] Hey, does this thing come from your house? - What thing? - I don't know. This flamingo thing. - [Dale] Oh, yeah. - What did you do, steal it? I know Michelle didn't give it to you. - No, she didn't take it. I gave her everything. She and Kate needed the house and the rest of that stuff. - Stuff? Your business? Your house? All the stuff you busted your ass to get. - I mean, I want all that for her and Kate, you know? - You're crazy. You know that. - I hang out with you, don't I? - Let's take your car. - Nah, it's running a little rough, man. - Give me a break. The thing runs like a Swiss watch. You tune it up twice a week. - [Dale] All right. - Besides, we're going somewhere classy tonight. - You? Classy? (slow bluesy music) - Good to see you, Mr. Z. How are you doing? Name? - I'm Jeff Langston's cousin. - There are no guests in his name. - Well, look. I'll go inside, I'll bring him out. We'll straighten this whole thing out. - Keys? - I gotta park it myself. - No, I gotta do it. - Look, you don't understand. If something should happen to this car, my friend here is gonna have to kill you. Here's the man himself. - Hey, watch these guys. They're liable to eat all the food and steal all the women. - Hey, cuz, just get us past Checkpoint Charlie here and maybe we'll leave you some scraps. - Hey, these guys are okay. - So, let's go party! Nice shirt! (gentle piano music) (guests chattering) - This is incredible. Hey, look, there's Congressman Fulton over there. Over there by the fireplace, that's the mayor! - Wow, look at her! - [Waiter] May I get you something? - Who is she? - [Waiter] That's Julie Weaver. - How about if I order up a Julie Weaver? - I'd offer you something more your speed. - Hey, buddy, tell me the truth. Is she out of my league? - Can you hit a 100 mile an hour fast ball? - Not in a million years. - She's going 110. - We'll see. - Matt, leave her alone, man. Matt! (guests chattering and laughing) - Senator! - Julie Weaver! Westlake High, right? - No. - I mean, I didn't mean that you went there, but didn't you go out with this guy, uh ... What's his name? From Westlake? - You tell me. - Um, you know, it's been so long, I can't remember. So, how have you been? - He's not always like this. Just most of the time. - Honesty will get you nowhere. - I'm going nowhere, so that's okay. - Matt Sheldon. And this is Dale Hartwell. - I don't recognize your names from the guest list. - We're late additions. - Oh, well, nice meeting both of you. Keep him out of trouble. - Wait a minute. You haven't heard my rap yet. - Yes, I have. More times than I care to remember. - Ouch. - Friends of yours? - High school buddies. - Pay attention to the important ones. I want them happy when they place the bets. - Must it always be business? - Don't ever turn away from me like that. I just want to thank you all for coming and let you know that I have an exciting afternoon of entertainment planned for you. I'm trying out a new fighter today and, as usual, the only betting limit are the depths of your pockets, so let's move on to the lawn and let the fighting begin. - Ladies and gentlemen! In the blue corner, fresh from his dojo in Okinawa, fighting for Peter Gallagher's All-Stars, the challenger, the mean lean fighting machine (growling) Hiroshi Tanaka! (audience applauding) And in the red corner, from the mean streets of Compton, the tenacious, the ferocious Jimmy Biganer! (audience applauding) - You know, a good fighter can make a bundle here. - Yeah, you know any good fighters? - I might. I just might. - Don't forget, folks! Please see the girls in the flowered vests to place your bets! Today, we are offering six to five odds in favor of Mr. Tanaka! (audience applauding) May the toughest man win! Let's get ready to rumble! (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (screaming) (thudding) (grunting) (audience applauding) (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) (grunting) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) (audience applauding) (screaming) - Yeah! (growling) (screaming) (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - [Man] Big winner today. - Did you see that? - Yeah, I wish I hadn't. I meant the fight. That guy just made a lot of cash. - Yeah, and the other guy's out cold. - Hey, what's with you? You get in there, you kick ass, we clean up. - Tell you what. How about, for once, you go in and do the ass-kicking and I do the cleaning up? - Ladies and gentlemen! It's time for the challenge round! Any one of you can step into the ring with Peter Gallagher's All-Star Champion, Victor "The Destroyer" Bragg! (audience applauding) A recent and most deadly acquisition from the old Eastern Bloc. $2000 for any man, woman, or child who can last two minutes with Victor "The Destroyer" Bragg! - I could last two minutes. All you've got to do is bob and weave. All right, old buddy. I'll do the ass-kicking. - Hey, Matt, this is dumb. - Come on, Matt. Don't go in there. This guy's gonna kill you. - Matt? Hey, Matt, come here, man. - We have a challenger! (audience applauding) What's your name? - Matt Sheldon. - Ladies and gentlemen, can we have a warm welcome for young Matt Sheldon! (audience applauding) - Matt, this is stupid, man! Get out of there! - Fighters, center ring. Let's get ready to rumble! (audience applauding) - Okay, Tarzan. Now, let's rock and roll. (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (audience applauding) - Give it up! Matt! - Come on, buddy! Get up, man! Just get off! (grunting) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - It's not worth it, man! - Get out of there! (grunting) (thudding) - 15 seconds! (gasping) (screaming) (grunting) - 10 seconds! (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thudding) (suspenseful music) - We have a winner! (grunting) - Matt! (audience applauding) (dramatic music) - Okay? Now, let's rock and roll. (screaming) (grunting) (audience applauding) (dramatic music) - Come on, breathe, man. Breathe! That's it. - Here you go. It was worth it. - Hey, I'd get him to a hospital. - Let's go. (crowd clamoring) - Okay, old buddy. I'll have you at the hospital in a couple of minutes. - No, no. Let's go back to your place. I'm okay. See? Two fingers. I'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah, I've had my butt kicked before. (lush orchestral music) - Hey, Matt? Hey, Matt, I'm gonna make some oatmeal. You want some? Matt! (suspenseful music) Man, what are you doing out here? You'll get sore sitting in that thing. Hey, Matt? Matt? Matt! (slow sentimental music) Matt! (sobbing) Matt! When Matt and I were kids, we used to play here all the time. I always remember him being a little funny kid. He would always tell jokes and stories and stuff. He really wasn't afraid of anything or anybody. We all loved him. I'll miss him. - Come on, Dale! (soft sentimental music) - Another one? - No, no. I gotta clear my head. - [Barry] Coffee? - Yeah, black. What would you say about a man who let his best friend get killed? - I'd say you're probably lucky you're still alive. - Gallagher could have stopped it. He knew Bragg was gonna kill Matt. - So, what can you do about it? - I'm gonna go fight Bragg. - Even if you could kill Bragg, Gallagher won't care. The only thing he cares about is money. Don't get any crazy ideas. You have a decent left hook, but Gallagher's men are pros. - I wouldn't be putting too much faith in that left hook of yours, either. - Please tell me you've come to pay your repair bill. - You're a real funny guy but you're right. I am here to pay you what I owe you. - Can we wait til this song's over? It's one of my favorites. - [Barry] Easy, easy boys. Come on. Free drinks. - Let's just forget this, huh? (grunting) (scuffling) - Come on, come on! (grunting) (scuffling) (grunting) (thudding) (scuffling) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) (glass shattering) (grunting) (thudding) - Still don't think I have a chance against Bragg? - Not a chance. You owe me a beer. - Blocking punches with your face isn't gonna get you anywhere but in the cemetery next to your friend. - Get up. - Slow down, Dale. You don't want to fight this guy. - Barry, stay out of this, man. Come on, get up. - Take your best shot. I'm not getting up. - If that's the way you want it. - You see that? Any good fighter, any one of Gallagher's fighters, could get out of the way of that punch. I knew where it was going before you knew you were gonna throw it. - Hey, man! I have never lost a fight! - You just lost to him. Take our advice and stay away from Gallagher's place. Hey, you owe me a beer! - Barry, get me some ice. Make that a bucket of ice. This kid's got an iron fist. Oh, man! (chuckling) (suspenseful music) - What do you want? - I'm the special guest of honor. - Sir, you're going to have to leave. (grunting) (thudding) (scuffling) (thudding) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) - All right, hold it! Let him in. (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (audience applauding) (grunting) - Why did you come back? - Did you hear about Matt? - Jeff told me. I'm sorry. - Yeah, well, sorry's not going to do much for him. - And you're here to do something for Matt? If you get into that ring, you may die, too. - Yeah, well, I just can't let it go. - I stopped fighting losing battles a long time ago. You ought to try it. Makes life a lot easier. - I've seen you with Gallagher. It doesn't look easy. - That's my problem, not yours. - You're right. (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) (audience applauding) - Gallagher's fighters are pros. He only pays them to win. - What's he pay you to do? - Nothing you can afford. - I hope his money keeps you warm at night. I want him. (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) - It doesn't matter. You're gonna end up the same way. (screaming) - You have to earn respect here, Mr. Hartwell. You beat a lesser fighter, maybe you'll get a chance to fight Bragg. (thudding) (grunting) (audience applauding) - See you in 60 seconds. - Pretty cocky. - Ladies and gentlemen! We have a challenger! Hey, kid. You got a name? - Dale Hartwell. - In the challenger's corner, will you please give a warm welcome to Dale "Pretty Boy" Hartwell! (audience applauding and cheering) You will be facing Olympic Gold Medalist and All-Star team member, Butchie "The Butcher" Tahata! (audience applauding) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (audience applauding) (grunting) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (audience applauding) (sentimental orchestral music) - You show up here again, you won't walk away. Understand? (sentimental orchestral music) - Well, I guess you were right. I hope you bet on the other guy. Does it look bad? - Well, don't enter any beauty contests. - I got to take my daughter to the pony ride tomorrow, so I guess I gotta come up with an excuse for my new face. - Yeah, what will your wife think? - Ex-wife. She'll think what she always thought, that I have bad judgment. - She might have something there. - Don't tell me you agree with her. - Well, you're standing here flirting with me. I'd say you enjoy taking risks. - Anything worth having takes risks. - I'd better get back to our guests. - Yeah, I wouldn't want your boss to dock your pay. - Do you have to be such a prick? - No, I just don't understand why you're with that guy. - Well, there's a lot of things you don't understand. Go easy on that face. - Yeah. (sentimental orchestral music) (knocking) - You're late. What did you have to do? Go buy that disguise? - Where's Kate? - She'll be down in a minute. Who hit your face? - Does it have to be the Spanish Inquisition every Sunday morning? I mean, I thought I traded in everything for a truce, sort of a land for peace deal. - Does it have anything to do with Matt's death? Why do you have to take every wrong turn, Dale? It's like you have to take the hard way every time. - [Kate] Daddy! - Hey, baby! How are you, hon? - Fine. It looks terrible. - Yeah, Dad cut himself shaving this morning. - Yeah, did you shave before or after the fight? (chuckling) - Bring Kate back on time, okay? Kiss? - Bye, Mom. - Bye, hon. - I'm sorry about Uncle Matt. - Yeah, me too. Things don't always go the way you want them to but he's in a better place now. - That isn't going to happen to you, is it? - Honey, I'll always be with you. (sentimental orchestral music) - She's awfully cute. - Yeah, she takes after me. You're an awfully long way from home. - I had business in the area. - Ah, I must leave a good impression. - Don't let it go to your head. - I'll try not to. Hey, honey, come here. That was good, sweetie. Come on. Alley-oop! (giggling) Watch yourself. - I don't think we've ever met! - Hi, I'm Julie Weaver. I'm a friend of your dad's. - A close friend? - No, just a friend. - Oh, are you married? - No, I'm not. (chuckling) - Oh, good! Then, you can come with us on our picnic! - Honey, she might be busy. - You're not busy, are you? - I guess not. - [Kate] So, do you cook? - I'm a super cook. I used to own my own restaurant. - I love osso bucco! - Osso bucco? (chuckling) (gentle orchestral music) - Mr. Green? You asleep? - No, I'm meditating on a world without stupid questions. What do you want? You come here to take another shot at me? - No, I want you and Mr. Lee to train me. - Train you to do what? - To fight. I want to go back to Gallagher's and fight Bragg. - The only chance you'd have would be to buy a gun. - A big gun. - I'm serious, you guys. - So are we. - I could take him, you know, with a little training. - You've got about as much chance of beating Bragg as you do of moving one of those boulders over there. - Which one? - What? - If I move it, you're gonna train me. - You're not gonna be able to move it and you're not gonna be able to take Bragg. Like I said-- - Buy yourself a gun! - Yeah, a big gun. Maybe two guns. - Two guns! - Yeah! Two big guns! What the hell is he doing? (chuckling) Maybe three big guns. (chuckling) What's he doing? (lush orchestral music) Stay down! It's a lot safer! - So, that's the kind of trainer you were, huh? Down for the count? - Oo! (lush orchestral music) Hey, hey! We don't need a gardener! (triumphant orchestral music) - So, do we have a deal? - Come back tomorrow. - Yes! We could start today. - Looks like you've already started. Tomorrow. - Okay, okay. Okay! Tomorrow! - Tomorrow. - Yeah! (suspenseful music) - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. - You can't be thinking about nothing. - I can think about whatever I want. - Okay, what is with you? - It's just that I feel like a prisoner here. - Look around you, baby. This is hardly a prison. A castle is more like it. - Yeah, for me and the Black Knight. - What does that mean? - I don't want to fight. I need to make the decisions about my own life. - Like you did when I first met you and your restaurant was going belly up and you were practically in the streets? - At least it was my business, my debts. - So, this is what I get for being kind. - Somewhere, kindness turned into control. - Does this have to do with Dale Hartwell? - No. - Don't even think about leaving me. You can't make it on your own. - Oh, really? - You walk out of there, you'll go right back to where you came from. The bottom. - Okay, okay, stop. - Stop what? We haven't even started yet. - Not exactly. He hasn't done anything, yet you've started without him. - I didn't do anything. I can't hurt you from here. You are over-reacting. - Good! You see? That is the first real reaction you've done yet. You don't do anything until your opponent comes into your range. You gotta stay relaxed then. Let him wear himself out. You stay cool. Save your energy. Attack, relax. Attack, relax. Mix it up. - All right. (intense dramatic music) - Great job! Hey, amazing! I don't know what happened! I'm sorry about that. Next time, better luck. There's a lot of fights coming up. (grunting) - Stop! Just watch for a second. Okay, simple. Simple, right? Basic. What's the difference between your approach and mine? - You're stopping between your combinations? - I'm not stopping. I'm watching. I'm learning. I'm learning from the effect of my attack. You just come in. You just barrel on in there. You don't learn a damn thing. - I'm putting pressure on him. - Pressure? You only have one chance in a fight. You gotta be patient. You gotta learn his weaknesses and use it to beat him. (crowd clamoring) (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (intense dramatic music) (screaming) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) (intense dramatic music) (screaming) (intense dramatic music) - Try to hit him. Hold it. Now, what did I tell you before? - Daniel knew where it was going before you knew you were going to throw it. - Yeah, maybe he's psychic. - No, you're just trying too hard. You've got to relax. You're telegraphing every move. (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (screaming) (thudding) (intense dramatic music) (crowd clamoring) - Hey, all right! Place your bets. The more you lose, the more you win! (chuckling) - Put your guard up. You're going to get hit. (grunting) Hello? - Yeah, I noticed. - Stop. Learn. Change. Strike. - You got it? Okay. See you later. - Okay. - I'll just wait in the car. - You sure? I don't mind if you come with me. - That's okay. Go ahead. - [Kate] Mom! - Hi! Did you have fun? - [Kate] Lots! - Your face looks better. - Thanks. - Who's the blonde? - [Dale] Her name's Julie Weaver. - Girlfriend? - I don't know. - Let's go in. - Goodbye, Daddy! - Bye, honey. - Breathe with your abdomen, not your chest. Imagine the air you take in as a fog. See that fog spread through your body. Get a visual-- (snoring) I don't believe this. (lush orchestral music) - Nice place. - [Julie] I guess so. It's not mine. - Yeah, I know. - Don't judge me, Dale. - I'm not. I just don't understand. - What's to understand? Gallagher has been good to me. - So, what? Now you owe him? - No, I just never had a reason to leave. - I could give you one. - You don't want me, Dale. You just want to get back at Gallagher. - Is that what you think of me? - Gallagher took from you. Now, you want to take from him. - Julie, I am here because of you. - I guess I just look for the worst in people. - Maybe it's the company you keep. - Well? What do you think? - That is good. That is really, really good. Where did you learn to make that? - It's my own recipe. - You're just full of surprises, aren't you? (romantic orchestral music) - Put your hand up. I'm gonna hit you. - Ow, man! - I didn't hurt you. You hurt you. You're like a stiff oak. You break, not bend. Absorb the blows. Up! Good! Good! (whistling) (suspenseful music) - Oh, come on, guys. I'm really not in the mood. - Well, get in the mood! - Wouldn't it be easier if you just paid me? (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (sentimental orchestral music) - Peter? Peter? - [Peter] That's it, baby. That's it. Now, turn around. (sentimental orchestral music) (waves crashing) (grunting) (thudding) (chuckling) (grunting) (thudding) How's the book? What do you hear on this Hartwell kid? - Looks like he's training with your old friend Tyler Green. - [Peter] Any idea how he's shaping up? - No, I haven't heard. - All right, look. I want you to get over there. Take a look around. See how he's coming along. See what Green's getting him ready for. You never know. You might find a way to make some money off the kid. - Right, boss. - Yeah. - Okay, let's pony, guys. All right! Come on, guys. Let's see some green here! Come on! Even money, even money. - I remember this guy. I saw him at Gallagher's. - Yeah, that's Hiroshi Tanaka. He used to fight with Gallagher. He's good. I don't want you to take this guy lightly. - I'll say. He creamed the last guy I saw him fight. - That's not your focus, okay? That's not your worry. Just get in there and do it. (suspenseful music) Go, guys! - Tyler Green! Long time. I heard you were back in business. Mind if I take a look? - Suit yourself. Mix it up! (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (crowd clamoring) (screaming) (grunting) - Don't get cocky, Dale! (intense dramatic music) (thudding) (grunting) (crowd clamoring) (screaming) - Whoa! (thudding) (grunting) (screaming) (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (laughing) (grunting) (thudding) (intense dramatic music) (thudding) (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (screaming) (groaning) - Excellent! Go there. - You did good once you got going. Now, go over there and warm up a little bit. Take a few breaths. - Okay. - That was pretty good. Kid's come a long way. - Looks like we've got some competition for Bragg. - Big tournament's coming up. - [Tyler] We'll be ready. - Really? - If the fighter's good enough, why not? - No reason. It's just that, Tyler, it's been a lot of years since you and Daniel have been over at the house, not since that unfortunate accident. - Maybe we're just waiting for the right time. - Good luck. Good luck. You look good, kid. - What a dick. - So, what's with this tournament? - Don't worry about that. You just focus on Victor Bragg. - Are you saying I'm ready? - I don't know. Daniel? - Ah, I knew it! - You've still got a lot to work on, okay? Your face is still a punching bag. Try to get some movement out of you. (laughing) (sentimental orchestral music) (knocking) (romantic orchestral music) - [Dale] I hate the thought of you going back to him. - Don't ruin this, Dale. Take it for what it is. - What is it? - Something good for right here and now. - What about tomorrow? - I try not to think about tomorrow. (gentle piano music) - [Peter] Have a nice evening? - [Julie] It was quiet. - [Peter] Really? I heard you had company. - You son of a bitch. You've been following me. - What do you think? You think I'm gonna let you walk all over me? - Don't start with me. I came by here the other afternoon. I saw you with that girl. How long has that been going on? - Oh, so you're trying to get back at me. - No, I wasn't thinking about you at all. I want out of this. - Now, you see, it doesn't work that way. You leave when I tell you to leave. Oh, and Julie? You see that piece of shit again, I'll kill him. (upbeat country western guitar music) - How can you listen to that slop? - That is great music. - You've got a phone call. - Yeah? Who is it? - I don't know. Some girl. - Why didn't you tell me? - Hi. - [Julie] Dale, it's me. - You don't sound so good. - I can't see you anymore. - [Dale] What are you talking about? - Gallagher knows. He has someone watching the house. He'll kill you, Dale. - Hey, slow down. I can take care of myself. - No, you can't. He can get anyone. It's hopeless, Dale. Stay away from me, Dale. - Julie! (dial tone humming) (busy signal buzzing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (explosion) (intense dramatic music) - Yeah. What do you mean it didn't happen? Do I have to do everything myself? (suspenseful music) - Well, well, well. Tyler Green and Daniel Lee. What a surprise. - This is nice. It seems a bit smaller than I remember. - Is this a social call? - Business. - Okay. What can I do for you two? - We want in the tournament. (laughing) - How would it look like if we let a cripple fight in the ring? - Danny. You keep your mouth shut. You know what I'm talking about. Dale Hartwell. - What if I say no? - You won't. There's money to be made. - Eight man tournament. Single elimination. $25,000 buy-in. $200K if your man's alive at the end of the tournament. - You know damn well we don't have this kind of money. - It's not my problem to keep up with you two clowns. Show or don't show. As far as I'm concerned, you're both just minor leagues. - Daniel was the best before we got involved with you. - Ancient history, Mr. Green. You come up with the money, you get the match. (chuckling) All right, let's go. Ready? We'll burn 'em. There you go! (grunting) - What's up? - Looks like the fight's off. - What do you mean, the fight's off? - Gallagher wants 25 grand for buy-in. - I got nowhere near that much, man! I mean, I got maybe two at the most. - We can put up five but we're still way short. - I'm sorry, kid. Man, you worked your ass off. I wanted this more than anything. - How come you haven't been back to Gallagher's? - What do you mean? - The manager. He said you haven't been there since the accident. What accident? Come on, you guys. Level with me. - About eight years ago, I was training Daniel and Gallagher wanted us to throw the fight. - We didn't do it. - You're damn right we didn't do it. So, we said no and on the way to the fight, we were getting in our car. Another car jumped the curb and crushed Daniel's leg. We never found the driver and Daniel never fought again. - We couldn't prove it was Gallagher. - Oh, it was him. It was him. - I knew you weren't in this for the money. Well, we're gonna make this happen. I promise you that. - How are we gonna do that? - You just meet me in the bar in two hours. - I love this kid. (chuckling) - Sorry, old buddy. It's the end of the road. - Hey, Max. - Hey, Dale. You know, if you're running a little short, that job offer's still open. - No, I need the money now. - Well, she is a beauty. - I did all the work on her myself. - Did you? Well, you do good work. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 10 for her right now. - Max, she's worth twice that and you know it. - You might persuade me to go 14. - 17, she's yours. - [Max] 16. - I can't. - Cash. - Cash? We're 2000 short. - What the hell did you do? - Sold my car. - You sold your car? I don't believe it. - Yeah, but without the two grand, we still can't fight. - It's not much, but I got 42 bucks. - Richard, I can't take your money. - No, really. It will give me a piece of the action. Good luck. - I got 110, Dale. There you go. Good luck! - 58 bucks, Dale. Knock 'em dead. - That's great! (triumphant orchestral music) - 97 short. (cash register ringing) $25,000 even. Drinks are on the house! (crowd cheering) - Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to Peter Gallagher's Tournament of Champions! (intense dramatic music) - I want you to fight smart. I don't mean think. React. Just let it flow out of you. You listening to me? Don't be thinking about her. The man in front of you. - Maybe you should think of her. It makes you fight harder. - Hey. (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (audience applauding) - Do you have the money? Good luck. You're up next. - I'm gonna win this $200,000. - Hey, what did I tell you? - I know. The man in front of me. - Come on, come on. You can do this. You can do it. (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) - Move! - Come on! Bring him home! (grunting) (thudding) (audience applauding) - That's it, boy! Stop it before you hurt yourself! - That was great! - That wasn't too bad. - Look, this guy's history. Just empty your mind now. Get clear. - Hey, you did great. - One more time, kid. Then, it's my turn. (suspenseful music) (intense dramatic music) (screaming) (grunting) (thudding) - Come on! - See what I'm talking about? Don't let him get his hands on you. (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) - He's fast for a big guy. (grunting) (audience applauding) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - You gotta stay out away from him. (intense dramatic music) (audience applauding) (dramatic music) We know this guy. Remember: Stop, learn-- - Change, strike. - Change, strike. - Yes. - Absorb the blows, just not too many. - Thanks. I'll try and remember that. (suspenseful music) - Begin! (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) - Oh, come on! (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (groaning) (audience applauding) - Get up! Get up, Dale! (grunting) (thudding) - No! (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) - Yeah! Get over here! Come on! - Good job! - Take it easy. You're hurt? - Here, right here. - Easy, easy. - Your ribs are broken. - What are you gonna do? - I want to fight. - Okay, then concentrate on the fight and forget about the pain. - [Tyler] You hear what he said? - Yeah, concentrate on the fight and forget about the pain. - Not here. Here. (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (groaning) (grunting) (groaning) (thudding) (intense dramatic music) (grunting) (grunting) - That's it! Way to go! (audience applauding) - You're up again. You need a break? - Are you kidding? Get him in here right now. How do you want it? Fast? Slow? - Don't make it look too easy, but I want him dead. (audience applauding) - Ladies and gentlemen! And now, for the main event! The finals, being billed as the Grudge Match of the Century! For the winner, $200,000! For the loser, nothing but pain! Can we please have a big round of applause for All-Star Team Champion, Victor "The Destroyer" Bragg! (audience applauding) In this corner, ladies and gentlemen, can we have a warm welcome for the favorite with the ladies, Dale "Pretty Boy" Hartwell! (audience applauding) Begin! (intense dramatic music) - That's it! Move, baby, move! (intense dramatic music) (crowd clamoring) (intense dramatic music) Yes! (crowd shouting) (intense dramatic music) Get up! Get up, Dale! (crowd shouting) (intense dramatic music) (screaming) Cover up, Dale! Cover up! (intense dramatic music) (screaming) (intense dramatic music) Come on! (intense dramatic music) Watch your back! (screaming) (audience applauding) - Come on, Dale! Let's go! Get up! - Dale! - [Matt] Come on, Dale! (triumphant orchestral music) - Bragg! (audience applauding) (intense dramatic music) (audience gasping) (intense dramatic music) (audience applauding and cheering) (triumphant orchestral music) (dramatic music) - Take it and get out. As far as I'm concerned, you're still small-time. I never want to see you around here again. (grunting) (screaming) - Major mistake. (intense dramatic music) (screaming) (grunting) (screaming) - Three days in Disneyland! - Put your bag in. - Let's go, let's go, let's go! (suspenseful music) - Great. Not again. - Relax. We just gotta meet the man who kept kicking my man's ass. Yo, pay him, hoss. (bluesy guitar music) - I would have taken 'em. (sentimental orchestral music) (waves crashing) (triumphant orchestral music)
