Hey cool, isn't it? You wanna try it? Got it? Thank you. Lowen! Come this way. - We are mortal. We need rest. Physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Life is a constant state of unrest. A constant fight against sin, temptation, sickness, and pain. Then death. Yes, death is our sleep. A time for renewal, reflection, and eternal peace. This is for you, Mama. Thank you. - I'm so sorry. To lose him like this. Oh God, Beth, you're so young. It just isn't right. Look at this orange flower, mom. - I've spoken with some people who can help with Lowen. Beth, you've got to know you can't take care of him. - Beth. Breaking down these flowers, grandma? Oh. Don't touch him. - I understand if you need to be alone right now. Why don't you spend some time at Shoal Harbor? It would do you good to get back there for a while. Both of you. - I'm selling your house, Mom. No one's living there, there's no point in hanging on to it. - I understand, sweetie. Just think about our little boy right now. You have to keep a level head for his sake. I know you're hurting. - Honestly, Mom, I don't feel anything at all. I did. Come on. See a boat, the boat. Yeah. Come on. We're going to the beach, pal, this way. This way. The 52! 52 come by yet? What? - The 52. No, sorry, I don't know. - Mommy, he's not. - Now man, I've been waitin' here over an hour, nothin's come by. - You can't get out, hmm? They took her. I know they took her, Jerry. And believe me, the helicopter came down and took her. - Come on, Jerry. - Did you? - Come on. - Did you see? - No, sorry. - Come on. - No, sorry. - No, we don't know. Did you see it? The 52. - No, we don't know. No, come, look. Even they kidnapped Jerry, oh my God. They kidnapped her! I know that, that's what happened. - Thanks, one for you. Good throw, one for you. Hey. Again. Uh oh. I'll bring it. - How would you like to take a vacation, pal? At Grandma's old house, just you and me. - That tickles. - Why not? Jerry, the 52 may be comin' any minute. Oh my. She's gone now, I'll never get her. 'Cause I can't swim, and she's out there. Oh. - We're goin' to Grandam's house. Remember Grandma's house? This is the way. Gettin' there. We're here! All right. I can't wait to go in the sand. It'll be fun. Ya. - Come. Come on. Come on. - What's that? - Oh, we're gonna go inside for a sec. No, we'll go to the beach later. Come on. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Oh, that's the sea. I screw this. No baby, nope, don't do that. Where's Dad? Daddy's gone, honey. - Daddy's gone? - Remember what happened to Black Fly? Meow. Black Fly got lost. - Hmm. - Yes sweetie, Daddy got lost. When will he come out? He won't come out? Will he come out? Hey, you eatin' your dinner? Mm mm. I wanna play. - Time to get into bed, hey.

Why do you call it the Crescent House? - That's the Crescent, way out there. It's a rock shelf under the water. Goes all the way around the whole ville. It caused a lot of shipwrecks in the old days. Keeps the water warm, though. - Aah, Mom. - And do you live around here? - Close by, but this is my favorite spot. Thought I'd pick up some trash today, I sometimes do that. - Lowen. - I think you'll like it here, the people are nice. But there are a few you should watch out for. - Watch out for who? - Dead folk who don't wanna stay dead. They've been watching your son. - Who's been watching us? What are you doing? Lowen, dinner. No, I want dinner. - Lowen? So tasty. So. - Hello. Yeah. I'm playing with Black Fly, Mom. - That's not Black Fly, sweetheart. That's not Black Fly? Hello?
