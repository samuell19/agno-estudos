♪ AUGUST 15, 1939, ENGLAND I can't go back! The camera is gone! - Now calm down! - Maybe you didn't understand, they stole it! - It's your assignment. - They know everything! - They know they're being watched! - You have to go back! I can not! - You have to do it! Now! - Hello? Germany attacks! Poland is in crisis! Britain prepares to fight the war! AUGUST-VICTORY COLLEGE OF BEXHILL-BY-THE-SEA SIX MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT Is this your first time here in Bexhill-sur-Mer? Yup. Is the first time. I hope he lasts longer than the other gentleman. See you later. And one, and two Come on! Hands on the ground. Keep your arms straight. And one, and two, Roll out. Very well. Well, girls. You go on, Astrid. Gut, Màdels. Also... Astrid! In English. Thanks. Five, six, seven, eight. - Can I help you? - I come for the teaching position, I'm Thomas Miller. Ilse Keller. - Welcome to Augusta Victoria. - Thanks. This way, please. - One! - Mr. Miller? Come on! Shoulders, arms out, and down. One, and two, and up. As you know, England and Germany have been allies for many years now. This is Augusta Victoria. The last German empress. If she wins the teaching position, her room will be on the top floor. Her modest room, but facing south. She looks perfect. Mr. Wheatley found her welcoming. Please, sit down. I don't have to fear the competition! She fide et Patientia. "Faith and perseverance". This is the college's motto. You better know. Good luck. Thanks. Wonderful, don't you think? - Eleanor Rocholl. - Thomas Miller. Thanks for coming on short notice. - Do not mention it. - Follow me. MONDAY 21 AUGUST I see it was recommended by an agency... And that he has taught in many different schools. Thanks. It wasn't a compliment. Here it says that he is a musician. I manage to play the piano. Helpful. He's married? I have been. Spanish influence. I wouldn't normally hire a temporary teacher, but his predecessor proved unreliable. My girls need discipline. We will soon introduce them to the members of the Anglo-German brotherhood. I guess they will be impatient. They don't talk about anything else. These are the last days of summer. We hope not. What brings you here, Mr. Miller? Which Englishman would accept a teaching position... In Herr Hitler's League of German Girls? My father was German. I don't like surprises, so he will do a probationary period. Thanks. When can I start? Good morning. I am Mr. Miller... And I'll be your new English teacher. Mr... Miller Good morning, Mr. Miller. - Good morning... - Astrid. Astrid. - We welcome you. - Thanks. Then, what did you study during the summer? Oh, please, sit down. Is there a book in English that you liked? Mr. Wheatley was not used to using books. Exact. He told us the stories. But really? Here, I'm not very good at public speaking. It doesn't have to be Shakespeare, Mr. Miller. Please tell us a story. Alright then. How about a story... How about a romantic story. That speaks... of a young man who misses his lover? Are you talking about you, Mr. Miller? No. The Fijhrer would say that he is not enough of a man. Would the Fiihrer say this? Please, tell us the story. Of the young man who misses his sweetheart. All right. Once upon a time, in a place called... What are they singing? We will have to keep an eye on him. Very well. Go in time. Not too fast. Grace, poise, Mastery. Remember, girls, that you will be the representatives of Augusta Victoria. Straighten your shoulders, Sigrid! Security in the eyes leaves an indelible mark. Gretel! Go on, Mr. Miller. The morning swim. Whether there is sun or rain, Ilse always insists. Why doesn't she join us? You know, Ilse was in the reserve team at the Berlin Olympics. Amazing. We are lucky to have it again. Their morning swim is all they will get to see of England. I want to protect girls from the dangers of the world. Have they never left this place? England can be a very hostile place when you are born a German. I think you know what I'm talking about, Mr. Miller. I almost caught up with you today. Yes, yes, in your dreams. I'm freezing, hurry up Paula. You are the last. No, I'm not the last. Gretel is always the latest. That toad didn't even get wet today. - Who are you talking about? - Gretel didn't swim! Use '.! Use '.! See you later. Courage! I know you are there! I can hear you breathe! Oh, finally someone laughing! Did you like it, my dear? Very well. You are really nice, keep it up, please. Oh, if this continues... My dinner is going to get cold, right? But it will never be as cold as marriage, will it, sir? She is really lovely. Now listen to me, I want to tell you a story that you will like. Well, at least I hope so, or I'll never work here again. Then? Officially they speak of suicide. Wheatley wouldn't have the courage to commit suicide, he was terrified when he called me. Someone got to him first. His information was right. Twenty girls, one governess, - a waitress, a cook... - I need something more! How's it going with the governess? And with Ilse Keller? My German helps. At least it's useful for something. You keep searching the house. We don't have much time left. Hitler is allied with Stalin and has carte blanche in Poland. The War Council claims the Germans will take the girls before the end of the summer. An early exit only means one thing. He'll have to block them before that happens. But if he intervenes too soon, problems could arise. What kind of plan is this? These are strange times, Miller. And every chess game needs its pawns. They're just girls, sir. They are the daughters and goddaughters of the Nazi High Command, so... Remember which side you're on, Miller. We will soon commandeer the boarding school and detain the girls. You hold on. Do you want to imprison them? He must wake up, Miller! The next war will not be like the ones we have experienced. Oh, these are the words I've been waiting for for twenty-five years!" SATURDAY 26 AUGUST because you are flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood. The same spirit that governs us burns in your young minds. When the pillars of our movement will cross Germany today... I know you will join them. We know that Germany is around us. That Germany marches within us... May Germany follow us! DG II Q0 DG II Q0 Forward. Miss Rocholl. It means "Salute to Victory", Mr. Miller, that's all. We must not apologize for excess of passion, or for pride. Should we criticize a country that strives to be great? Bexhill was a beautiful city to grow up in. Its sea, its landscapes, its community. As a child, I felt safe. My father loved me very much and gave me a sense of pride. My teaching and my college are dedicated to this. These girls they are my life. They give me hope. That's why I join them when they say "Salute to victory". “Sieg Heil”, Mr. Miller. I don't expect you to understand me. Who knows she doesn't know, she knows her. But who doesn't know that she doesn't know, she doesn't know. Only who knows that she knows nothing, she knows more than who knows." Good. "In a well... "Once a wolf was reflected in a not so gloomy well..." Here you are. Were you looking for me, Mr. Miller? I was worried about you. - And the girls were too. - He's not a good liar, Mr. Miller. Girls don't like me. But that's okay. I'm smarter than them. Yes, I really think so. But you don't seem very happy. Gretel, what happened to Mr. Wheatley... Fraulein Keller says... That I have to overcome my fears if I want to be strong. Gretel... Do you think she is right? Gretel, it's normal to be afraid. Really? Yup. What scares you, Mr. Miller? Astrid. Time to go in, girls! Choir rehearsal will start in ten minutes! I am still not convinced of this tour. After what happened, maybe girls need a change of scenery. Yes, but we must not go too far. Some recreation is just what you need and Fràulein Keller said the view from the castle is magnificent! I would like to say the same for the choice of transport. - What does Ronnie want now? - Girls, stay seated. - Guten Morgen. - I can't say the same. - What is happening? - First line of defense. We need to get the claws out. There is a lookout post in Eastbourne. In Eastbourne? What do you think Hitler will do? - What are you stealing our fries? - You need to be ready. As you say, Ronnie. See you. RENT CHARLIE'S BUS PHONE BEXHILL 4290 Damn eat sauerkraut. Come on guys! Resume! We also needed a tour. From here I can almost see Germany! Be careful girls! Mom, save me from this horrible food and... - from swimming caps! - And from bad weather! Girls! Now calm down! Mr. Miller is right! You will wake up the sleeping giant. Are there giants here? Ask Miss Rocholl. A long time ago, they lived on top of the hills... - and they saw all of England. - What happened to him? They scared someone, I guess. Like Sigrid. One of the giants protected the castle. They gave him bread, mustard and a pig's head of beer. He slept down there on the shore. Why is the sand so flat there? - Because the giant was heavy. - Heavier than a steamer. It is said that he was able to swim to France without getting his head wet. But look at it, Mr. Miller. A true gentleman. You are very elegant tonight, Fraulein Keller. Thanks. - We want to go? - Sure. Let me say thank you. ANGLO-GERMAN ALLIANCE. The girls will be happy to meet you. It will be a real honor for me to meet them. This way. I shouldn't do it without asking Frau Rocholl's permission first, but I know how much she loves Reuther. Look. She is very proud of this piece. Enchanting. She finds? The dance of fire. There are only seven examples. Tomorrow night. Tomorrow? I need more time. I got orders. The girls have to leave before the war starts. Do you know a place? - Yes. - Are you sure? Safe enough to allow a plane to land? Yup. - What is that? - A film. A list of British agents working in Germany. There are all the names. Do you think the Fiihrer would authorize this trip if he didn't get something out of it? He wants them back. All of us. She wants you to do your duty. Girls can't just be caught. Where is that place? Use? Is everything all right? I was just showing the minister his Reuther. Do you forgive me. I am a private collector. I had to see it with my own eyes. Of course. Get to know Lord Brocket. He is a close friend of Astrid's father. Certainly. The "if! Have you seen Mr. Miller? Oh, Astrid, here you are. Can you round up the girls upstairs? They say that the success of a great agreement is based on two aspects: The first is to appreciate affinities; and the second is to respect differences. Tonight we will join with the other side of the sea to celebrate a very special bond. Representing the Anglo-German Alliance, let me introduce you to the “Augusta Vittoria... HOG GOD THE FATHER - Ouch, how bad! - Focus, Sigrid! Before grace, there is strength. And before strength, there is... - Pain! - The training. Belly inside. And dance as light as a feather. Do you think you are better than us? I'm organizing the meetings, Miller. I don't like her to take initiatives! - The girls are about to leave. - When? Tomorrow. - How do you know? - Ilse Keller. Tonight at the Anglo-German party I heard her talking to her contact. - And how will she take them away? - With an airplane. Where is it? I have to inform the War Council. Can you assure me I haven't been caught? - Yup! - Are you really sure? Damn! Call Whitehall. One-one-five-four. He has to sound the alarm. Colonel. Colonel! Colonel. Hey! Stay where it is! He doesn't move! - What did he do? - It wasn't me. George! Come here now! He is running away! Stop! Stop! Police! He is trying to hide! - I saw it! - Get it! Scatter yourselves! Search the beach far and wide! Reinforcements are about to join us with the dogs! - Watch! And he! - Yes I saw it! He is running away! Police say he is a dangerous man. A killer. Why would he do such a thing? Did we really know him? He was our teacher and we liked him. It can be difficult recognize the disposition of a person. There are those who are good, and those who are bad. What is the difference? It is not always easy to say. How do you tell the difference between the wasp and the bee? Wasps can't make honey. Exact. Who wants to give another example? - Gretel? - Alligators and crocodiles. And how do we understand the difference? - From their teeth. - And...? From the shape of their skull. The Jew is... The Gentile. We have been duped by Mr. Miller. At first it may seem difficult to identify a "Jew". But there are ways to figure it out. I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt. After what happened, I was wondering if the girls would like a break. A cup of tea. Maybe at the end of the lesson. You have to forget about her. Forget about this place. Germany is your home. Where do you think you are, in Shangri-La? In an hour we will play at the Winter Gardens. Get moving! And Bill, don't send sand into your flugelhorn. Come on, Jackie! Hurry up! But, sir, I just got here! Now! And fix yourself, if I don't ask too much! If you get on the bus before Hitler invades Poland, I'll buy everyone an ice cream. Very funny! Very funny! Which of you stole my clothes, huh? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN? Gas masks at Woolworths? In short, where will the world go? She said to me: "You better get used to it, dear, because soon there will be a real catastrophe." It will be here somewhere. This is scary news. No, but when I think of that terrible teacher, I get goosebumps. How, haven't you heard? He killed a colonel! He is said to be a Nazi spy. I... - I need to make a phone call. - Wait your turn. - Anyway, I was saying... - It's really urgent. I have to do it now. Stan! Stan, this man wants to get into the cabin! - What is he doing? - I need to make a call right away. You have to wait for her turn. It's a government matter, I have to do... Yes, yes, and I'm Charlie Chaplin. Go away! - What is happening? - He wants to taste a punch? - I am not joking. - Ok, ok. Bravo, he goes away! He entered an occupied cabin. - Come on! - Are you OK? - That way. - Are you OK? Hey! Ehi you! Hey! Hey! Hey, you're wearing my uniform! You are blind? Hey, look at me! He took my uniform! It's my uniform! I tell you! You think you are... Jackie! Where do you think you're going? Hey! It's my uniform! Get it! JEW - KIND Boiled eggs and vinegar. They are used to heal bruises. So my mother said. - Sergeant... - Sir? Captain Drey. Cabinet Office. I like his uniform, old sport. - It's not mine. - Which makes you a thief... - He's a killer. - And a spy. Corporal Willis is a meticulous man, don't you think he is? Yes. Let's not forget that he is a spy. - A German spy. - What did I tell you? I hope you know why you are here. He is accused of killing Colonel Smith, esteemed citizen and hero of the Great War. Contact my superiors in Whitehall, they'll tell you I worked for Smith. I didn't kill him. You call them. - The number? - One-one-five-four. "Six minutes to midnight?" I haven't used that number since Cable Street. Whitehall, one-one-five-four. I do not have much time. Can you pass it to me or not? We are on the same side. Whitehall. One-one-five-four. MAN HUNT FOR MURDER Then? He hasn't been active since Uncle Stanley's time. Nice try, Miller. Call again. But nobody answers. - Shall I start the car, sir? - Thanks, Willis. Call them again. If he wants answers, he has to call that number again. Make up another story, Miller. That's a piece of shit, right? Give me the key to the handcuffs. I know who killed Smith. I found out the escape plans. I am not a German spy, but a British agent! I collected the evidence. A list of Nazi conspirators, British traitors. Get me out of here so I can prove it to you. Show them to me. Get off. This is Miss Rocholl, I guess. Yup. What is it, why did you bring him here? I need to gather evidence. I don't want you to disturb my girls. They are German, right? My girls are not the enemy. We will be discreet. Fraulein Keller? Can I help you in any way? First, you don't have to move from here. Nobody leave this place! - I don't like her tone. - The "if! No problem. They often tell me. Her room? Lead me through. Go into the garden, until those men leave. Ok. So? I'm in the fireplace. Look inside. Found something? Give us a moment, Willis. It's an order, corporal. How careless, my corporal has the keys. But don't worry. If in here is what he told me, we will free it in the blink of an eye. Please excuse me for the music. After all that fuss, I needed to calm down. It does not bother me. How much more time will you stay there? The time it takes. Would you like some tea? Thanks. Use? I'll tell the girls. Excuse me. How long have you been working in this school? A little over a week. Tell me about Miss Keller. She-she Killed Smith. - Because? We compromised your operation. The Germans were about to take the girls and she found out we knew that. So his cover was blown. Was it just her and Smith? Nobody else? What is he doing? She cannot enter. - Why is he here? - This is none of her business! If he has any questions, he can ask my corporal. He is getting impatient, so hurry up! If I had thoroughly searched his room, I would have had no reason to come here. First Wheatley, now him. Are they ready for tonight? Yup. And you? Are you ready... To do what is necessary? Nothing will be left unfinished. Yup. I believe the word you are looking for... Let \ be dankel: Now leave us. - Gretel, what are you doing here? - I was looking for you, Brother Keller. Out. Get out of here. A war with Germany would mark the end of England. An alliance is the only hope of surviving, and to live in splendor. Salute to victory. Save your energy. You will have to be ready. Yup. Give me, leave it to me. My mother brushed my hair. She passed the brush a hundred times. And if she found a knot... The hand. The hand. What were you doing outside Herr Miller's room? What a cute girl. Always there to observe. So you are not a teacher! No. She is English? My mother was! So is she a spy? So it seems. Is your name Thomas? Yup. Good. This chaos will kill her. Get in! I have to make a phone call. Not here, man. I'm afraid my phone isn't working. Let's see. It should be fine. I'm going to get her some clothes. Move, dude. - Do the clothes fit you? - Yes thanks. This will help her relax. What do you need the phone for? My job is to prevent Ilse Keller from taking the girls and information to Germany. Information? Details on the British agents operating in the rear What are you telling me? Is war about to break out? What will happen to the girls? They will be held as prisoners of war. The carefree years last too short. Quick, she goes into hiding! - I'll keep them busy. - They are dangerous men. Don't waste time. Look inside the bus. Whatever happens, you don't come back inside, do you understand me? At the right time you run away. Those girls deserve better, like all of us. - Charlie! - It was a pleasure! Can I help you, gentlemen? We have to go in, Charlie. Just a moment. Old habits. My wife will kill me if we ruin the carpet. Where is your lady? As I said, "old habits... Did Thomas Miller hurt you? Actually no, sir. Good for you. She took some clothes and then ran away. Single malt. "Old habits... Something like that. Would you like some tea? Good idea, Charlie, I can take care of it. Sit down, Charlie. Helping a foreign spy is a betrayal. You will be hanged. Already. It is not a smart move. So, are you a traitor, Charlie? I'm not a traitor, sir. He is half English, that's why I helped him. Very well. Then, where did he go? Astrid! Beatrix! What are you doing? The "if! The" if! What is happening? I demand you give me an explanation! Are you taking my girls away? They were never "his". The "if... Don't you dare to go out! Stop immediately! Don't you dare to go out! Stop immediately! The "if... What happened to you? I grew up. Contact center. Number, please. Whitehall. One-one-five-four. Excuse me, can you repeat the number? Whitehall. One-one-five-four. I put it in connection. Ready? Ready? - Can you hear me? - I hear it. Loud and clear. Tell me the exact time. Six minutes to midnight. - Repeat, please. - Six minutes to midnight! You have permission. This is Thomas Miller, send a TX-84 to Bexhill-on-Sea! - Miller! - Hello? Put it down! Agent Miller! - Please repeat! - Get out of there! Agent Miller! Please... What happens now? - We're taking her inside. - Where is it? Where they will hang her. Corporal, ask the captain how you know Fraulein Ilse Keller. Useless attempt. You tell the corporal what information you gave you. Should I handcuff him, sir? No, it won't be necessary. It's his fault, Miller. If you remember that. The German girls will depart from the Suffolk Coast tonight, location unknown. Send a plane to intercept. There is no more time! Message received, Captain Miller. They are about to leave! Alert the air defense fleet! They'll take them away on the plane, so you'll have to find an airport, Miller! Yes but where? He arrived late. He took them away. All of them. My girls. Stop! Please! No! Keep walking. There's no time. Always you, I would have bet. Sorry, it's an old suitcase. It's not her fault. My suitcase is too heavy. Shall we walk to Germany? Or is it another of her stupid exercises? Don't make things harder, Astrid. Stop! Keep walking! Astrid, don't do this... We will not follow it. Your family needs you at home, Astrid. Who gives you these orders? Who gave her the power? It's not about power. - No? - No. England doesn't want us. Don't you understand? I'm trying to protect you. As? What do you want to do, Fraulein Keller? We go back! I admire your strength, Astrid. Start walking now! Get moving! Get up! Come on, come on, move! I have to find the girls. I'm in danger. They will take them away by plane. Ilse told her about a place... Isolated, flat where a plane can land? She'll serve her bread and mustard and a beer pig's head. Beyond Pevensey Castle! Along the beach. I was there. Corporal Willis? I'm dying. Go. Go! Wait! If you thought for a second that you could leave me here, you are wrong! Walk, girls. Walk. How many bullets are there? Who are you, Thomas Miller? How many bullets? Five. - She won't hurt them? - I'm a secret agent. A spy. - Do you work alone? - Whitehall is coming. - What are they going to do with the girls? - You don't have to fear for them. But if Ilse's mission fails, no one will survive. I can not understand. If Germany cannot catch the girls, she will kill them. - But Ilse is one of them! - Not anymore! Stop! Turn around! Divide! Stop! Turn around! Turn around! I trusted her. I lived in a lie. “Salute to victory”. But there is nothing to win here. Wait! Prepare yourself! Now! God have mercy! We are late. We approach the location. Visibility is good. Prepare for landing. - We're under attack. - Let's go up! No! Fraulein Keller? - Fraulein Keller? - You shut up! Drop the rockets. Come closer. Use '.! It's over. Give up, it's over, Ilse! If only she was right! Turn around. Turn around! Ilse, don't do this. Use '.! What are you doing? Use '.! Use '.! It doesn't have to go this way! Gretel, get away! Gretel, you're freezing. I... was scared. You were brave, more than any of us. SUNDAY 3 SEPTEMBER Where will he go, Mr. Miller? The War Department is waiting for me. It seems my work is not done. The girls will remain under his tutelage until we make a decision. Not bad for a “recommended teacher... Faith and perseverance. Exact. Girls! One two Three. I'm talking to you from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street. This morning, the British ambassador to Berlin handed the German government an ultimatum... In which it is stated that in the absence of a confirmation by 11 this morning the immediate withdrawal of German troops from Poland, the two nations would enter a state of war. I have to communicate to you that we have not received any acceptance of the request made, Consequently... Our country is at war with Germany. THE AUGUSTA VICTORIA FEMALE COLLEGE IN BEXHILL-ON-SEA IT WAS THE FIRST AND LAST COLLEGE OF THAT KIND IN ENGLAND. IT WAS OPEN FROM 1932 UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 1939. SIX MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT
