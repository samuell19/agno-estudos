A man has committed murder... locked, trapped in a room, he recalls how he became a murderer. Daybreak - like to hear more? - Shut your trap, will you? You did yourself a lot of good! You, too! What happened? Did someone fall? Someone... someone fell! Help! Is anyone there? - What's up? - Dunno. - A blind man was shot. - It was suicide! I'd do the same in his place. Someone fell... why did he shoot? Who is the dead man? I never saw him before. He was found on the stairs. Shall we go up? Yes, ok. Police! Open up! Go to hell! Police! Open up! Lf you don't... no, I won't. I have nothing to see you about. Go away. I want to be left alone. I don't want to see anyone... ever! Open up or else... I won't! Beat it or I'll shoot! What's wrong, fran?ois? What type of chap is he? A brawler? A drunkard? An alcoholic? Mr fran?ois? He's the nicest chap here. Meaning no offense... you're right. He's a good lad. A good lad who fires on my men. Enough! Let's go upstairs. I knew gerbois was a bad lot. It's not him, but the chap next door. Gerbois still looks a bad lot. No one must stay on the stairs. - Where are you going? - I won't stay with criminals! There is no danger, madam. So you say... my spoons! You can't stay here. - But my spoons... - blow your spoons! - Come along. - My spoons! "Police! Open up!" What could they understand? Nothing. You suddenly do it... and that's that. Talking to yourself now... flowers... how nice! On my saint's day. So your name's fran?ois! How did you guess? Easy! My name's fran?oise. So we celebrate together! - Who are they for? - Not for you. I was delivering them and I lost my way. Where are you taking them? To mrs legardier. I see! She's the assistant manager's wife. She never comes here. I'll show you. Go straight on. D'you see that hangar? Go round it... and you'll see a house with a garden. It's there. Still here? You'll grow roots... you look pretty with your flowers. Like a little tree! This place interests you, eh? Some job, eh! Well, work means liberty... and good health! They look after our health here! We're always drinking milk. Like some? No, thanks. I don't care for it. Nor do i... but I drink it. So do i! He'll drink milk when cows eat grapes! Cheers! You work near here? - Where? - At briquet's. The market gardener. Are they relations? I come from an orphanage. How odd... so do i! What ajoke! We've the same name and come from the same place. And today is our saint's day! I said this was a healthy spot! You've a sweet mouth. Coming out? Not tonight. Come in, but be quiet, everyone is asleep. I'm allowed in! No longer shy? I'm not really so shy. What were you thinking of? You know very well... why ask? We've not known each other long... not long? We met 3 weeks ago, that's 21 days... almost a month. That's a long time... if you like someone. Do we need a wedding with a hired car and all our pals invited? A wedding? You really are silly! A wedding! We'd have kids, dozens of them... and put them into homes! I was only joking. But kidding apart, I like you. I really want to marry you. My iron! You know, it's funny being here... while everyone else is asleep. They might all be dead! You know, it wouldn't be so bad if they were... and only us two left alive. Yes... perhaps... people in love are said to be more alive than others. Is it true? I don't know. You shouldn't smoke if it makes you cough! Lt's the sand, not the smoke. There, I've finished. Pretty, isn't it? I'll fix it on my dress. Wait a moment... I'll call you. If you'd told me, I'd have worn my dinnerjacket. It's bad manners to leave your guests in the kitchen! And I don't like being left alone. You didn't say, "come in", but I will. Do... I wasn't long, was i? Did you dress up for me? Your room's nice... even if it is rather small. And your bunk is... a bit narrow. It's wide enough for me. For you, maybe... me! And several of them too! Nice of you to have me here. A familiar face in a strange place makes you feel at home! Who's he? That's bolop, my bear. I've had him ever since I was small. One ear's missing, but he's cute. He's like you. There is a family likeness. You are alike. He has one twinkly eye and one a little sad. You're right. I have one twinkly eye and one sad eye. - How did you notice it? - I watched you. It's funny... you collect postcards! Monte carlo... villefranche-sur-mer... nice... the "promenade des anglais"... that's a very smart spot... you pay for a deckchair and watch... the english go by! Why laugh? The riviera's lovely. Ever been? No, I've been told about it, so I know a little. There are big red rocks and the sea... and casinos all around. Casinos! The sun shines and there are flowers even in winter. Mimosa... you and your casinos and mimosa! Lt's an airy fairy dream... maybe, but sometimes it's so drab here. Because you live alone. But if you lived with me... you're so nice... of course I am... don't laugh! I'll buy you a bike one day, and then if it's fine at easter, we'll go and pick lilac. Lilac... - what's wrong? - I pricked my finger. Let me see. It's nothing. Want me to stay? I'd leave early... no one would see me. - Not tonight. - Why? Don't you like me? Yes... but I have an appointment. At this time of night? They let you go out? Everyone is asleep. I can go. I'm in charge of the house. "Ln charge"! You're not jealous? Not at all! You're a free agent. So am i... we all are. Let me know if you want to see me again. - I'll take him with me. - Oh no! Why not? I don't like leaving empty-handed. Clever! I did it on purpose! Valentin knows his stuff. A better trainer doesn't exist. He was here before, 3 months ago. Clara's not bad, but she's not in the same class. The swine... women are fools, but I top the lot. I must have bats in the belfry to stay 3 years with him! Just tell me when your housework's done. "Housework"? You come along and wash your dirty linen in public. What's it got to do with me? Don't get annoyed, I just didn't want to talk to myself. You don't know how happy I am this evening... freedom is quite something! You're not very friendly... - you could offer me a drink. - Ok, what'll you have? I was joking. I'm celebrating today, I'll invite you. Naturally, you can't know... but how that man can talk! He has a way of using his hands... as though he kept his spell up his sleeve. He can talk you into anything. Take the riviera, for instance... he starts talking about it... and you're right there. That's how he got me... with mimosa. What's the matter? Nothing. You could say something nice to me... what? That you're beautiful? I can't tell with all that make-up. I take it off before I go to bed. It isn't every day a woman is free and meets a man she likes. You've got blue eyes... they're quiet and restful. At least you don't talk much. Shall I say I love you? I'm sick of men who talk of love. It's true. They talk so much, they forget about love. I'm not so absent-minded. Hey, you're not going to desert me now! I wanted to see you home, but I can't. Do you mind? I'm old enough to go home alone. You're not angry? But my evening's spoilt. What's one evening at your age? Run along home, like a good girl, and I'll be round tomorrow. See you tomorrow. I like ajoke, clara... when I make it. - But quitting the act... - the act! Don't make me laugh! I'm through. The act's over for me. No more dogs, no more touring. I'm on my own now. We leave tomorrow! Steady, the lady's with me. Temporarily... not at all! Lt's for life, isn't it? What's your name? Mine's clara. You're ridiculous... you're the one who's ridiculous... and rude! I've my own way of dealing with rudeness: A good swift kick... if you think vulgarity settles the matter... sailing dates... ships due at boulogne... the 6th, ss veendam from new york... the 13th, ss noordam from new york... sailing dates... it's all very sad. He said good evening to me and even stroked the cat. The cat? I wonder what he's doing now, all alone... it can't be much fun. No, it can't be. It gives you the creeps... where can I sleep? I can't afford a hotel. You can't do it! Fran?ois isn't a crook! He's just an ordinary man! You can't kill him! He must've moved a wardrobe. That's all we need! Hey, you down there! What? Is there a wardrobe in the room? What? I asked if there was a wardrobe in the room. Of course there is. A big one? Big? How should I know? Lt's just a wardrobe. Just a wardrobe... made of solid oak or something... like any other wardrobe. Everything all right? We've got to make the best of it. Everything all right? We've got to make the best of it. Come in! Are you alone? Silly! Of course I am... as you never come near me. It's sunday today. Complaints are not accepted. You look lovely. Truth rising from out the well! The truth! Careful... or I'll tell you a few home truths. Not this morning, I'm not curious. I'm in love. In love! What next, I wonder... I've been here 2 months now... why? And for whom? A brute like you... but I'm a nice brute, aren't i? A nice brute... who drops in occasionally... when he feels like it, like a tourist. You must admit I travel light. That's the trouble. You never bring your things. That was never intended. I know. You promised nothing and I asked for nothing. All the same... what? - I get bored at night. - Can't sleep? - I can. - Well? I have nightmares. I dream you're not there and then wake up with a start... and you're not there, so it doesn't help. Call that a love life? Love life indeed! You're silly! That's all right in books, for chaps with nothing to do. But I slave away all day. I need my sleep at night. But during the day... it depends... sunday morning, for instance... doesn't the light worry you? The winter sun is kind. I prefer a bit of shade. Well, I say! - What's up? - Look! The trainer! What a time to choose... what's he want? - Nothing good. - He's come to see you. More likely come to see her. I told you never to mention her. He won't hesitate to do so. What's he doing all this time? What's he doing? Well, isn't that nice? I listen at keyholes! But I've no principles. Does that shock you? Lt's odd, but it's always honest folks who can't bear eavesdroppers. So they've something to hide! Don't listen, or he'll never stop. He's a doctor of philosophy. I always was very intelligent. Can I help that? I hope I'm not disturbing you. I can see you're so happy together. Mind, I'm not jealous... I'm a nomad. Here today, gone tomorrow. But it warms the heart to see the birth of happiness. Have you finished your oration? What do you want? I don't know... I just dropped in. It's amusing. I'm back like a ghost. Like to see the dogs? Women forget quickly. Poor little creatures... not women, the dogs. You can't make us jump through the hoop! Come to the point! - What do you want? - He wants to talk to you. And you want to talk to him. You'd better go... he'll go with you. What you've got to say doesn't concern me. You know, clara, it hurt me when you left me. Hurt you? Really! You must be growing old. You're growing old. - Coming? - Hang on. What'll it be, gentlemen? - Glass of white wine. - Brandy spritzer. We can't stay here forever. You're back for fran?oise? I've been here since yesterday and I've learned quite a lot. For instance, that you're still chasing her. None of your bloody business! You can't avoid explanations by vulgarity. - Explanations? - That's right! I've tolerated your affair with clara. I could have put a stop to it. But I let it go... I'm broad-minded. Maybe, but your brain's too tiny. So ideas just tumble out anyhow. First it's fran?oise, then clara. You're muddled-headed, tired... clara's free to do as she likes. But fran?oise... it's time I told you something. Try me. I'm interested in her. Because she is... my daughter. It may seem odd, but it's a fact. Fran?oise is my daughter. A brandy spritzer and a white wine. She's an orphan. Children from orphanages don't have parents? I'll be honest with you. You see before you a poor wretch. I have my faults, like all men. My vices too... but at heart, I'm no worse than another. I did wrong, I admit it. As for her mother... we mustn't be too hard on her. When we had this child, I was young. I didn't understand. A youthful peccadillo. Ajoke. But as you grow older, you realize it wasn't ajoke. It was a crime. It haunts you. Stupid perhaps, but that's what is known as remorse. You start to think of nothing else... you search... you'll never know how I searched! I checked and rechecked... when I saw her, the image of her mother... what a woman she was! A beauty! The same green eyes continually changing... what a world! Lt's a small world. We each go our way. But the wheel turns and we're back where we started. It's my duty to intervene. Your duty? Duty! Forgive me, but I want only one thing: The child's happiness. It's a simple, natural reaction. And frankly, she can't be happy with you. You're unbelievable! There's no other word for it! Playing the father! What a nerve! He deserts his daughter, and 20 years later, he creeps back... tears in his eyes... to do what, I ask you? To moralize! What ajoke! Listen... I'll tell you something: I come from an orphanage too! And if my father or mother dared preach to me, I'd tell them off! Anyway, what's it all got to do with me? I love fran?oise, do you hear? What do you say to that? - You do? - Yes. - And her? - Never you mind! After all, my dear fellow, think... I've a right to know exactly what there is between you! A right! I'm fed up with you! What do you hope for? Tell me that... you wouldn't... you don't hope to... not fran?oise. I have a responsibility to her. You have no money, no future, and bad health. You have an unhealthy job. What? What did you say? You're lucky you're her father! Now listen. Get up and go. Go quietly. Hop it. Get me? - It's odd. - What? We meet every day, but you live with her. You know I don't live with her. - It's the same thing. - Not at all. Do you love clara? No, I want to live with you. Would you like that? We'd be happy... but you know, there is... something that's worrying me. Or rather someone. Someone? Come! You know who I mean. So you're still jealous? Lt's not jealousy. Now I know who he is, but you should have told me. - What? - That he's your father. My father! But he's not my father! - He's not? - No. He loves making up stories. You should have heard his yarn! He's mad! What does he want? And why do you go on seeing him? I told you. He's been kind to me. The only one who was kind to me... until I met you. He brings me presents, he writes to me... the picture postcards! He's traveled and knows a lot. He hasn't and he knows nothing. He's a maniac and a liar! He makes me sick! Lf you'd heard him: My daughter this, my daughter that... I tell you, he's nuts! I won't see him again if you want. Really? And I won't see clara again. Don't you hate a guy who lies all the time? We all lie. I've lied myself. It'd be a lie to say I hadn't. I don't like liars. I'm not a confirmed liar. I love you, so you can't be. It's nice here. - Remember what you said? - What? We'd pick lilac at easter. Haven't you enough flowers here? They're hot-house plants, not like the country. The country's so lovely. I do love you. You're so lovely... so delicate, like a young animal. The first time I saw you, I knew what happiness meant. I love you. It's sweet of you to say so. Sometimes when I'm alone, I think about love, too... I'm happy and I feel like laughing. But listening to you right now, I'm happy... yet I want to cry. I don't understand it. I don't like pain. Pain? D'you think I do? But we two will be happy. I've never been happy before. When I was alone, I didn't care. I've always been unlucky. Unlucky in all kinds of ways... once I had a new cap. A puff of wind caught it... gone. Same old story... unemployment, lousy jobs... the jobs I've had to do! All kinds ofjobs, but all the same. Spraying paint, red lead... that's bad for you, too. It's like sandblasting. After a bit, I had to give up. Things were going badly. I set up on my own. It's like waiting for a tram in the rain. It doesn't stop... it's full up. And so is the second and third. You stand there, waiting... like a fool. But now, I've got you. You want to keep me for always? Of course. Do you love me? This is for me. I really care for it. I've always worn it. Do you love me? Yes, I love you. There's nothing to explain. I knew it when you walked in. You looked like an undertaker. I'm not in the mood forjokes. What about me? But it's not a tragedy. Luckily we're not in love. If we were and had to part, that would be terrible. - You angry? - Why? I've been very happy with you. I didn't want to end it, but I lived here and you over there... we were too far apart. Don't pull such a face. I'm not pulling a face. You are! You'd think I was dropping you! So sensitive, so touchy... you all make me laugh! What'll you do now? Look for ajob. I know people in the business. I once worked for a seal trainer. Are seals nice? The trainer was nice too... to me. He was brutal to the seals. I left him to join valentin. He used gentle methods. He trained a dog in 3 days. D'you know how? He shaved the fur off its paws and burnt the skin with a hot iron. Then during the act, he tickled the wound with his whip. Enough! He's disgusting! And mad! He's not mad. He's rotten. Like a bruised fruit. He knows it. So he hurts others, as consolation. He destroyed something in me too. Still, I mustn't grumble. I had a break with you, a rest cure! I didn't want to hurt you. I want you to remember me as a friend. I shan't forget you. If I could, I'd forget you at once. Memories... do I look as if I live on memories? But I'll give you something. A present to remember me by... what? Valentin gave it to me. Shocked? He had a stock of them. I took them to make him buy more. Like to see them? Nothing easier! Lt's a scoop! A bargain! They're very pretty... from italy. Here... look. Aren't they nice? All his mistresses get one. She has one too, hasn't she? What are you staring at? What are you all waiting for? Has he gone mad? He'll jump. - What's up? - He's at the window! What? I'm not a freak! What are you waiting for? You expect me to jump? A murderer's interesting. I'm a murderer, yes! But killers can be met in any street... everywhere! Everyone kills. Everyone! Only they kill... by degrees, so it's not noticed. Like the sand that gets into you! Beat it! Go home and read about it in the papers. It'll all be in print. You'll read it and believe it! What else are the newspapers for? They know everything. Beat it, or you'll catch cold. Scram! Let me alone! Alone, d'you hear? All I ask is to be left in peace! I'm so tired... I don't trust anyone anymore. It's all over. Give up, fran?ois! Others have killed and are alive! Come on down. Listen, boys! There'll be quite a good job going... with overtime! Go after it! Lt's a piece of luck! Fran?ois, come down! There's hope... who is fran?ois? I don't know him! He doesn't exist anymore. So leave me in peace! Go away! We all know you. You're a good chap! - Don't be stubborn. - We'll stand by you. Come down! - What now? - We wait... we have orders. Clear the square! She fell. She must've hit her head. - We can't leave her here. - Take her to my room. Where are you going? - She's hurt! - This is no clinic! What d'you want? I must talk to you, man to man. Beat it! Beat it! I won't go till you've heard me out. I've listened enough to you. Get out! Fran?oise won't see me. I know you put her up to it. Then why ask me? I know everything. You can't hide things from me. - You're lucky. - I am... am i? Deceived... a laughing stock. What a lucky man! You had a good laugh with clara! I don't care, I've no false pride. But what are you up to with fran?oise? Don't start again! You've played the father once already. Melodrama bores me. I was about to turn in. I work all day and every day, see? So I set my alarm and get to bed. Then tomorrow I start all over again. Now, get out! Get out! - I'm unhappy. - Who cares? Men can talk to each other, but you're not human. - Aren't i? - No, you're not! I did spin a yarn the other night. I'm not her father. Are you shocked? You're revolting! I've imagination, I'm a dreamer... I invent exactly what I like. I couldn't bear that she... stop fidgeting! You're like a cornered rat! So keep still! Keep still, dammit! I haven't moved. It's odd... I thought that manual workers... had no nerves. Shut up! You're on the edge... because you're uneasy. Because you can't understand certain things. Women are so complicated! And girls so mysterious! I'll make you shut up! I'll make you! - You don't scare me. Hah! - Laugh away! Go ahead and laugh! Lf I threw you out, you'd laugh! Stop it! You're crazy! I'll let you go, but it's a pity! Lt's silly, I feel all dizzy... dizzy! I feel dizzy all the time. Clara's right, I'm getting old. I can't control my nerves. It's not so easy to kill a man! I know something about it. That's what I came to do. Yes, I wanted to kill you. Just an idea I had. I often have wonderful ideas, but I never follow them through. I'm ajoke. A rotter. Yes, you are. For tuppence, I'd burst into tears. What a man I was once, though! Lf you'd known me when I was young, you'd have liked me. Everyone liked me. I expect you were as disgusting then as you are now. Disgusting? Me? Disgusting! Well, why not? Lt has its advantages. You aren't! You're honest, straightforward and trusting. What a fine thing trust is! This is nice too! A pretty trinket. A pretty present for a little girl! What d'you mean? What do you want to know? Nothing. Hold your tongue. It's funny how simple people get strange ideas about women. Love... romance... of course, they love you! Lt's wonderful to be loved, eh? They don't love me, but I attract them. That's the whole secret. And as I attracted her, she and i... silly of me - I adore youth! Interested? - Like to hear more? - Shut your trap, will you? Will you shut your trap? You did yourself a lot of good! You, too! Gas... where is he? What have they done to him? I love you. Don't move! Try to sleep! I shouldn't have said I loved him. He's changed, he's not the same. Explanations, always explanations! We love each other, fran?ois! I trust you. Not so loud. She's feverish. What is it? Gas... they're not going to suffocate him? No, it's tear gas. It'll make him cry and cough. It's unpleasant for a while. The sand has made him used to it. What does it matter? He doesn't love clara. That's all. He can't help not loving her. You love me, fran?ois. Don't excite yourself, try to sleep. I can't get up. - You remember what you said? - What? At easter, we'll pick lilac... remerciements au minist?re des affaires ?trang?res.
