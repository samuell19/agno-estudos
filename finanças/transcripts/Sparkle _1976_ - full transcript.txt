Just a tune, I'm working on. 'Come on, girls. It's almost dark.' I don't want you hanging around those steps. Come upstairs to your own house. Momma, it ain't even dark yet. Just get on up here and don't sass me, miss. - See you later, Stix. - Goodnight. Later, little girl. You make me sick. Honestly, I can't see why those girls spend so much time out there in the street. Only a good friend can say what I'm about to say to you, Effie. And you can say right back to me "It ain't none of your business, Miss Waters." But I think you better keep your eye on that oldest gal of yours 'cause she's busting at the seams. - Sister? - Hm-mm. Oh, she's just high-spirited. Always has been. She takes after her father. Well, Sister, how pretty you look tonight. - Are you here again? - Mind your manners, young lady. - Hi, Miss Waters. - Sparkle, take off that dress. Delores, have you done your homework? - Almost. - "Almost" ain't done. - How about yours, Sister? - 'Oh, I'm finished.' Aww, let me see it. - Let you see it, huh? - 'Uh-huh.' Alright. Oh, mom, you don't have to iron our clothes. We're old enough to iron for ourselves. You iron enough at your work. You ain't our maid. 'Well, I enjoy ironing clothes for those I love.' Suppose, you love them crackers you work for on Long Island too. You better hush your mouth. Go get your homework before I give you this iron in a place you won't forget. Yes, ma'am. Honestly, uh.. ...I don't know who teaches her such things. You know it ain't right, her talking to you like that. All you've done for those girls. Hi, Sparkle. Let me help you. You play real fine, Stix. Just working out some new ideas for when we start the group. You sure smell good. I used some of Sister's cologne. You look real pretty too. Sister fixed my hair this morning. How come you're always talking about your sister? 'Cause she's so fine. I love her so much. I wanna be just like her. Uh-hm. What about you? What about me, what? How old are you? Fifteen. You sure are pretty for a girl. Oh, I gotta go. Uh.. You ever been kissed? - Don't. - Why? It's a sin. Well, does it feel like a sin? Feels so good, it must be a sin. - I gotta go. - No, you don't. I do. I promised. I've gotta straighten Sister's hair tonight. I did. I promised. Okay. This better be something worth my time and my trouble. Now, would I lie to you, sugar? I don't know. I must be crazy coming down here with you. For you, baby. Where did you get this car? Friend of mine loaned it to me. Since when you got such friends? Well, I know it might come as a shock to you, girl but there's some things you don't know. You stole it. Woman, you is the most suspicious thing I've ever seen. Go ahead, get in. Go ahead. These seats are soft, ain't they? Hm-mm. Almost as soft as you. - Keep your hands to yourself. - Come on, now. You know I'm dying of love for you. Levi, where did you get this car? - It's only the beginning, baby. - The beginning of what? Of me and you. Shortest story known to mankind. Goddamn, baby. I get you this car and I tell you how crazy I'm about you. - And what more do you want? - I want the big time. Well, you're sittin' right next to it. - Come on, give me a kiss. - No. - Come on. - No. Open your mouth. - Come on, open your mouth. - No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey, baby, you something else. Why do you keep on doing that to your hair? It wouldn't hurt you to get a little glamour, honey. You don't see no kink on Marilyn "S-for-Sexy" Monroe, do you? Marilyn Monroe is a cracker. If you keep on doing that to your hair, it's not natural. - It's not natural. - Would you hold still? - You want me to burn you? - Sorry. Sparkle, I heard something on you. Miss Waters told me she seen you on the roof with Stix. Ain't nothing wrong with me talking to Stix on this roof. Heard you was doing more than talking. Heard you was messin'. - It ain't true. - It is so. - It ain't true. - It is so. - It ain't. - It is so! You want momma to hear you and ask what you're talking about then you wanna tell her? Ain't nothing wrong with messin'. Just make sure who ever you're messin' with stops down to the drugstore and takes care of some business. - Oh. - Hmm. - You hear me? - Mm-hmm. Don't come around here with no big belly, crying talking about you didn't know what you was supposed to do. And pick out somebody nice.. ...with enough money in his pocket so you can stop down to the Busch Jeweler at 125th Street and buy you something nice. See what Levi got me? - Levi Brown? - Mm-hmm. - You kidding. - Cost $17. Real diamond chip. Levi Brown hustles with nickels. It's about time Levi got some good luck. Sure is a mighty small stone. You're late. Did you play my number, yet today, Shimmy? How can I play your number when no one's here to watch the store while I go use the phone on the corner? Well, the reason why I am late is 'cause, uh.. I was having a dream and I didn't want to wake myself. Yeah, yeah. Just unpack this box. And in the middle of this here dream there was this blinding flash. Just unpack the box. And right smack-dab in the middle of this blinding flash there were, uh, there were three numbers. You dreamed three numbers last night? - Uh-huh. - Well, what is they? I just got time to call them in. Shimmy. What's that sign on the window? Oh, fellows from Lotus Records here this morning. Gonna give free passes to Brooklyn Paramount to the first ten who buy The Moonlights' new album. Here, write those numbers down for me. What's it to Lotus Records if you only give away 5 passes? What are you talking about? Let me have five passes. I never asked you for no favors. You ain't supposed to. You is an employee. Now, what's those numbers, boy? - What's the matter? - Uh-oh, ah.. I-I think I'm having a memory attack. The numbers just-just flew right out of my head. Well, they better fly right back in there. You know, it's a funny thing about my memory attack.

You know, trying to get us into clubs and everything. Why, man? Why? I-I can't be no part of no singing group, man.

Levi, help me show Miss Taylor to her taxi. - You son of a bitch. - I'll meet you outside. 'You son of a..' 'You dirty, rotten bastard!' Get her out of here. Give me this damn coat. Hold onto that, man. It belongs to me. - Mr. and Mrs. Thompson? - Yeah. No luggage? Uh, we're in town just for a wedding. We didn't plan to stay over. Miss Thompson, over there, how old is she? Eighteen. - You got a marriage license? - Sure. - Here it is. - Mm, I see. Oh, here. Thank you. I ain't never been in a hotel room before. We're getting too big to make love on the roof. Besides, it's getting too cold. Look, Stix, they got the toilet wrapped up. And the glasses. And look, Cashmere Bouquet soap. 'Hi, Mrs. Thompson.' Alright, alright. Who is it? 'I wanna talk to you, Satin.' - Too early in the morning. - It's almost noon. Alright, what's on your mind now? I've been working for you a long time now. - A few months. - 'Yeah.' I've been a real good worker too, ain't I? Yeah. Got no complaints. So far. Yeah, well, I need more responsibilities, man. - 'Like what?' - Hey, I ain't makin' no money. You're doing alright the way I see it. I got plans, big plans for the future and I need big dough. Now, I'm ready and you know it. Levi, let me decide when you're ready, okay? Yeah, okay, Satin. Effie. Miss Waters, how you doing? I didn't expect you to come by tonight. I just thought I'd see what all the carrying on was all about. Well, you shoulda let me know sooner. I'd have had a special table for you. I...I mean, we just decided a few minutes ago to come down. We can sit anywhere. 'Course, if you don't have room for the mother of the stars. Well, there's room. Wait just a minute, okay? Levi, Effie's here. I'm saving these seats for Satin. - Miss Williams, how you doing? - Hello, Levi. - Miss Waters. - 'Stix. Stix.' Where's Satin gonna sit at now?

This is my dressing room too. It's my dressing room too and I said get out. Hello, gorgeous. I thought the exterminator was here last week.

No, you haven't. I want you to crawl for me. - You want me to what? - Crawl. - Bitch, crawl, bitch. - Ow. Bitch, crawl! Crawl! I heard the prettiest girl in Harlem used to work here. I guess she must have moved on. Don't start with me, please. Alright. Oh, Sister. Don't touch it. You're gonna let that nigger kill you? It ain't nothing a little make-up can't cover. Sparkle went to get it. - A little make-up? - Hmm. What else is that nigger pushing into you besides his fist? Nothing. Why don't you go out now and leave me alone. No. No, not this time. Did you get it, baby? Yeah. - Let me see it. - Give me that! Give me that, give me. See what you did? 'Do you see?' I'm sorry. Your sister can't fly on one wing. Good evening, gorgeous.

Working so close with Satin and all. He must trust you with everything, huh? Everything. So...what you doing after the show? Just free as a breeze. Hey, where you going, baby? I'm-I'm just gonna go downstairs in the lobby and get some cigarettes. Okay? Okay, hurry back. - I'll be back. - Alright. - 'Operator.' - Hello, operator. Would you give me the police? - 'Is this an--' - Please, operator. - It's an emergency. - 'One moment, please.' '25th Precinct, Sergeant Riley.' - Police? - 'Who's this?' Never mind who this is, just listen to what I gotta tell you. There's gonna be a big pickup tomorrow morning 2:30, on the Manhattan Bridge. A man by the name of Satin Struthers. 'Thirteen-362, Roger William' 'Six, Paul, John, Zebra.' '692.' 'Containing a male, 45 years, 5'11, 190 pounds.' Get on the radio. Pick up that car. Halt! Halt or I'll shoot. Levi's gonna be alright. You okay? - Yes. - You alright? - Yes. - Okay. - Did you see Levi? - No, they wouldn't let me. 'He got shot in the leg. Stix got him a lawyer, though.' 'I just don't know what it's gonna be this time, Delores.' How could this happen to Levi? Somebody blew a dime on me. I think it was you. Hey, you crazy, man. What you talking about? Somebody blew the whistle on me to the bulls horn. - I think it was you. Now, talk. - Look, you crazy, man. Don't you know Levi Brown's my best friend? Whoever blew the whistle thought they would get me. I'm the only one that knew Levi was gonna make that pickup. Now, talk. You're losing your touch, Satin. You been beatin' up on women too long. 'You're finished, you know that?' Fellas you work for, they're gonna bust you up. And you gonna be right where you belong. 'In the gutter with the rest of the shit.' I didn't drop a dime on you, but I wish I had. - Delores? Is that you? - Yeah, momma. Where you going? - I'm leaving, momma. - You're leaving for where? I'm leaving and I'm going away. What do you mean? I mean...I can't live like this anymore, momma. I got to find another way. Well, whatever troubles you got here are going right with you in that suitcase. You-you don't understand, momma. Like...like there's education like there never was before. Momma, we don't have to be slaves to the white establishment anymore. 'We don't have to live off what the white man throws our way.' Thanking him for his lousy pay and lousy jobs. We don't have to run around shining his shoes and driving his cars and cleaning his floors and being his maid. Go on now. Say it. Being their maid. Huh? Yeah, momma. Being their maid. Momma...I've seen you ever since I was a little kid. Getting up in the middle of the night to take the subway to ride for two hours to go to their house to do their cooking and to do their ironing and do their cleaning and wash the shit out of their toilet. And for what, momma? For what? Bye. 'Then he says to Benny' 'I only got two left.' 'Funny story.' 'Funny story, Moe.' 'But you should have left Benny in Vegas.' I'd do it. But seriously, friends. Let's have a toast to our gracious host and hostess. Moe and Lee... you're the tops. 'Hey and while we're toasting, let's not forget' 'why we're here tonight.' 'I'm sure Moe and Lee will join with me' 'in toasting the Lorenzo brothers' 'and our new business venture.' 'To the success of Amerikas Enterprises.' Hey, Effie, more champagne. Just one week, Mr. Daniels. Stix, I have to put another act in. Just put someone in temporary. Look, I know we can get it together in a week. Okay, one week. Ow! I can't be no singer. Oh, Tune Ann, you're the best singer in church. - C'mon. - But that's church. That ain't being on stage before all them people. Why, I'd shit in my pant-pants. Come in. She's not here yet? Did you call the house? The phone's disconnected. She'll be here. She always has been before. I would like to pay you for tonight anyway, Stix. I'm awfully sorry. You are welcome here, anytime. Goodnight. Thank you, Mr. Daniels. Goodnight. Stix, Stix. Stix. Wait, Stix. - Wait. Stix, wait. - I'm finished. - No, please don't. C'mon. - I worked my ass off. But nobody gives a damn. Delores goes off, don't tell me nothing. And Sister, what did I ever do but try to make her something special? - Stix, we could start again. - Yeah, I'm going upstate. What do you mean "upstate"? A friend of mine working up there in construction. Been making five or ten dollars an hour, he tell me. What, what about us? Will you come with me? I can't leave, Stix. What's momma gonna do now? Delores is gone. - Stix, what about Sister? - What about her? I'm the only one who cares about her anymore. Then you stay. What do you mean? What do you mean? Look, I gotta go. Now, you're free to come with me or stay. Please, please don't make me choose between you and my sister, Stix. I ain't making you do nothing. Stix. Stix, please, please, please don't leave me. I gotta go. 'If I stay around here, I'm gonna kill somebody.' Stix!

You're sure a comfort to Effie in her time of trouble. You're a nice girl. But I think you better stay away from that cake. - Hey, Stix. - Hey, Tune Ann. - How you doing? - Okay. - Is, uh.. - Everybody's in the kitchen. Hi, everybody. Would you like some coffee? Uh, no, thanks. I was, uh, wondering.. - Well, I was hoping.. - Sparkle is in the bedroom. 'Thanks.' What do you want? I'm looking for a girl singer. Didn't you know? This family is fresh out. - Sparkle-- - When did you get back? A few days ago. - My granny's been real sick-- - A few days ago. I must have been out when you called. Sparkle.. - Look, I know how you feel. - I know you do. It's funny. One brain in this room thinking for two people. Since when you know how anybody feels about anything except yourself, Mr. Stix Warren? Look, Sparkle, we got a lot to talk about. But unless you talk about it, you know, just give me a chance. Give you a chance? Wanna hear something funny? When you first left.. ...I wasn't sure if I would be able to live without you. Yeah, I used to sit in this room and wonder will I get through another second. Can you imagine a person so unhappy they don't know if they'll live through another second? I got through the seconds, Stix. The minutes, days, months, weeks. I'm doing fine without you. 'Just fine.' Sparkle, no matter what you think of me I came back 'cause I want you to sing. Why you think I've been so busy since I've been back? Got me a job at the record company. Lined up all my old contacts. You were always so good at business, Stix. - Business. Business. - Baby, it was for you too. And it is now. - I want you to sing, Sparkle. - What have I got to sing about? Stix, what have I got to sing about? I loved Sister, too. What happened to Sister happened to Sister, not to you. 'You got your whole life. I mean...I want you to sing.' 'Don't bury yourself with your sister.' Get out of here. Get out! Nobody ever understood Sister except me. Don't you ever, ever use her name again. - Sparkle, listen. - Get out of here. Get out. ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Livin' in a world of ghetto life ♪ I heard Stix put his grandmother in a fine home where she'll be taken care of real good. That's nice. Some folks think he's a fine boy. I'm one of them. Momma, do we have to talk about this again? Well, honey...it ain't like you being so...so unfair. I told you a long time ago, I said "Spark, a man's got to do what he's got to do." Now, I know he ran off and left you but he came back, didn't he? Just to make records. Stix is right to want you to sing, honey. Why, I hear you in church singing for Sister. You like to break my heart, the glory of what God gave you. I don't feel like singing, momma. But just go see him, so you give yourself a chance. ♪ Baby I love you ♪ ♪ Yes I do ♪ Do you feel like doing it again? I'm tired. Well, how does your voice feel? Okay. You know, I think you're ready to make a record. - The demo? - No, the real thing. Finished product. Background singers. Big orchestra. Everything. - Makes me nervous. - You're nervous. You know, how much money I gotta come up with for that? How much? Ten thousand dollars or more. There's only one man I know who got that kinda money. - Mr. Gerber. - Sit down. Sit down. - You want some soup? - No, thanks. - You ever had matzo ball soup? - No, I don't think I have. I knew you never had it, because if you ever had it you could never say no. Another bowl of soup. I heard a lot about you from Sparkle. And I heard a lot about you from Effie. Now that's outta the way, how much money you want? Ten thousand dollars. If she's so good why don't you let a record company finance her record? That's their business. It's also their business to sign her up for life. This way what we make belongs to us. What're you putting up as collateral? My word that I'll pay you back any interest you name. Thank you. Nobody's gonna give any money with that kinda collateral. Listen Mr. Gerber, Sparkle's got more talent than anybody that I know, she's gonna make it big. And I'll find somebody, some place who'll give me the money. Sit down, sit down. All I said was that you ain't gonna get the money from anybody. I'm gonna get the money...if I like her. Like her? You'll love her. She's fantastic-- If I like her, this will be the deal. I'll borrow the money from my business associates and you will pay me very handsomely for the use of that money. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Eat your soup. Okay, do it one more time. Try to do that one again. And Sparkle, just relax baby.

The next stop, Carnegie Hall. There it is. All back, plus 16 percent interest. Now how's that for a business man? You should feel real proud of yourself, Stix. I am. I'm really proud of you too for takin' a chance on us. I'd like to talk over something that would be kinda, what I'd call a sticky situation. Well, my turn to help you. I'm real glad you feel that way about it, Stix. See, the business associates I borrowed the money from.. Well, they're very quick to recognize a good business investment when they see one. And you're doing very well. You mean they want more interest on the money? No, it's not like that. They would like you to keep their money. - Keep their money? - Keep their money. Consider it an investment in the future. - Future of what? - Sparkle. You see her having a big hit record so young. They feel with the record business growin' the way it is. - And you know, Vegas, TV-- - No, w-w-wait a minute. You mean for a measly $10,000 they wanna take profits from me and Sparkle? Now, don't get excited. A deal is a deal. I made a deal with you, Mr. Gerber. I paid you back every cent, plus 16% interest that you asked for. You know, our business is finished. It's not as simple as that, Stix. A deal is a deal. Listen, you weren't born yesterday. I didn't just walk up to some nice banker and ask for $10,000. 'You've been around. You know what we're dealing with here.' And you're a nice man, Mr. Gerber. I really liked doing business with you. But who you do business with is your business. Wait a minute, Stix. My associates...if they let you off the hook then they look weak and they consider it very bad business to look weak. Wait a minute. Stix. Stix. Stix! Stix. What a surprise. What're you doing here so early? - Can we talk? - Yeah, what about? Well uh...Lee Gerber came to see me last night. He found out about Mr. Gerber's business affairs and the people he's mixed up with. Stix, she asked me to come here and talk to you because she's afraid. Those people will get you unless you do what they want. Don't you think Stix can take care of himself? Don't you know they're messing with a boy from Harlem? What you worrying your pretty head over nonsense for anyway? You know what you should be worried about? Is what you're going to be wearing to the concert tonight. Besides, Mr. Gerber don't know everything. I got it all under control. Look, go and get yourself together, okay? - Where could Stix be? - Oh, you know Stix. He's out there telling the orchestra how to play. Or he's showing people to their seat. Or he may be selling tickets at the box office. Ah, it's one thing, he ain't doing. - Because it's all sold out. - Yeah. Hey, how's your parents, Tune Ann? Ask me in an hour. Better see if the other girls are ready. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Ray Charles at Carnegie Hall. And to start the program off, a great favorite of Ray's.
