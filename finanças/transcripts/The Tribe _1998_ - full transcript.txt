[mellow rock music] [metal jingles] [upbeat theme rock music] [footsteps thud] Oh Jesus. Jesus Christ. [coughs] I thought I was late. -Thank god for it. -You got about 45 seconds? Okay. You always managed to be first. I don't know how you do it. You probably have been sitting here for half an hour -haven't you? -That would be too easy. I see nobody is nearly ready as usual. This is Dietrich who will be helping me to acquire some properties in Europe. Now, I hope you got a couple of surprises for me, because I certainly have one for you. [upbeat rock music] What you make of him? Yes, it look liked people on the most wanted list. I didn't know the Amish had started a branch in London. Bennett took these, the next week he ran off to New Zealand. He couldn't handle it. This is a group of buildings we have acquired south of the river. That's right on the edge of London. South of the river. It's a very daring. What is this area like? [Jamie] Sorry, why are we buying down there? Because it's the pit of the universe. No, no, no, no. These buildings are on a hill, Lilac Hill, staring down right over the inner suburbs. From a distance actually it looks rather fantastic. Certainly, when you get closer- Then you realise that it is in fact -the most violent part of town. -At the moment. The front of this building is empty but the flats behind these crazies have lease on three flats, a legal right to be there. We have to get them out otherwise we won't be able to sell any of the bloody apartments. Jamie, I want you to take care of this. I want you to interest them in the generous offer we're making to them. -You look surprised. -Oh, well, I was, I... I just thought I'd be involved with the Cressey building. -No. -Oh. There is a trip to outer darkness for you Jamie, do you think you can manage it? Yeah, sure. Of course I can. Certainly bring back some better pictures. Yeah, well don't worry, I'll be back. You reckon? -Yeah. -Yeah. When he lets you go, you get the tap on the shoulder so just keep watching for it. [clicks tongue] Yeah, well that's not gonna happen. Yeah, and another piece of advice. Just don't take your car down there. -Yeah? -Yeah. They will strip it of everything. You're going to the bad lands. -[eerie electronic music] -[train rumbles] [suspenseful music] [boys jeer] [sombre music] Who are you? -I've come with an offer. -An offer? What kind of offer? I'm from Gold Lee's Holdings. This is our property now. I've come to discuss terms. [train rumbles] I didn't get in. Can't go back to Kanahan and tell him I didn't even get in to negotiate. You got a refusal. They said no. You got to report that. No, that's not the answer he wants. I was assigned to this mission to that God forsaken place. I was rejected in 45 seconds. Do you know I got a feeling I should go back and make them a better offer but without consulting Kanahan -first. -Really? Shouldn't you check with him? I know he wants results and, I can get results. [men jeer and shout] [Man] Where are you gonna park it, mate? -Nick it, rip it. -Rubbish. You're not going in there are you? [men jeer] [mellow music] I've come to bribe you. That sounds promising. You don't need to lock it. Nobody will touch it while it's in here. [mellow music] [footsteps thump] -Hello Mr. Gold Lee's. -I'm not Gold Lee's. I know that. So you've come with a better offer have you? I hope you think so. How much better is it? It's what I would call a substantial improvement. [Emily] And you've got approval from your boss, -have you for this? -Yeah, of course I do. No, thank you. Just like that. No, thank you. I really would urge you to give this some thought. -No, I'd just like to- -Buy a little time. No. I just like to find out something about you to see if we might be able to find something to interest you in. If you don't mind. Are you a religious group? Do we look like a religious group? [Jamie] Yeah, you do a bit. No. No, there's no particular religion here. And do you follow any other beliefs like a sect? -A what? -A sect? You mean a cult? Ruled over by some terrible charlatan getting money out of defenceless young people? Yeah, something like that. Could I inquire about your source of income? Not today, no. Well, if I was to make a small cash advance? I mean, not to acquire the lease of course, but maybe to encourage you to dismantle the walkway outside, which we're almost certainly legally entitled to do ourselves anyway. I mean, if... I think this interview is over, don't you? How much more did you offer them? -Another 19,000. -And you still didn't go anywhere. You wanna see the nightmare file? Look at this, properties that have become infested. New age colonies, cults that have barricaded themselves in. See us having the siege of Lilac Hill. Well that won't happen, I'll see to that. Yes. Jesus, you fly into almost any airport in the world and you see little knots of these people selling revolting handwoven baskets and pseudo ethnic knick-knacks. What sort of sect are we dealing with anyway? -I'm still finding out. -Well find out. Yes, I will. And then we're gonna get them. I don't enjoy doing it like this, but it is the only way. You sniff around them. And as soon as you discover the slightest signs of them breaking the terms of their lease, -drugs- -Right. Unlawful sexual activity, et cetera, et cetera, we send the police in and hit them without warning. -Okay. -Okay. [melancholic music] [Emily] So there you are. I knew you'd come back. -But of course. -Come to spy on us? I've been sent to spy on you, yes. You wanted to see how we made our living. -Yeah. -The source of our income? -Hmm mm. -Come with us, you can take a look. I was hoping you'd say that. I'm sure we'll find we can do a deal. [car door bangs] [footsteps thud] Never seen rubbish bags like that before. Where did he get them? [melancholic rock music] [truck rumbles] What are you selling, some sort of ethnic knick-knacks? [melancholic rock music] All right, phones near the front. We want the phones to be the first to go today. The mobile's always -go quick. -They don't have replacements. They're one offs. 35 yeah? [people murmur] They know it all. I've got all of this at home. Nothing here I haven't got. Nothing you can show me I haven't seen. There's always one total crazy. Stealing tournaments all perfectly legal. You didn't believe me, do you? No, I don't, not yet. It is unbelievable the prices you're offering. Have I got another one? What's that? Smells good. Does it tastes as good as it smells? Hmm, that is fantastic. Jesus, what did you put in that? Hey, you got no idea what you're missing. It's great. [metal can clangs] [mellow music] [Boy] It's a nice camera you got there mate. Have you been pointing that thing at us? Now let me have a look at it? -What? -Do I need this suit, innit? You got nothing to -be worried about. -I only wanna look at your -camera. -Come on lets have a look. -Its a new camera innit? -Oh great. [Boy] Are these your mates, are they? -Bunch of freaks! -Weirdos. Freaks! [group of teenagers mumbles] Come on, we got some work to do. -You weren't frightened? -No. -What's this, more sauce? -No, something even better. So what have you find out? -I don't know how you do it. -Oh, you're not meant to know how we do it, but what's your best guess? Well I... Hmm, what are these? They're delicious. I'm sorry. You, are either you're some kind of modern day Fagin and you're using these kids to somehow steal all those highly desirable goods. [Emily] Or? Or you're some kind of a witch. [chuckles] You think we're all witches, oh my goodness. Do any of you do any of the kind of work? [Emily] Adam does, but you find it difficult to guess. So what keeps these kids here? What keeps them here? You mean what hold do I have? How do I terrorise them into doing my will? I don't know, Lawrence. How do I terrorise you to make you stay? I terrorise her. I deprive her of sleep. Mm, sounds promising doesn't it? Maybe an opening here. You could get us for what, being an unruly house, immoral behaviour. Hmm, what are we not allowed to do? I must look it up. [melancholic music] Do I get shown around? You're not allowed in here. Sorry, I was just- I know what you were just doing. You were curious. How did I get to look around? That's very difficult. We have an open day once every three months and outsiders invited. Do you want to come? How can I apply? You just have. -[phone rings] -[people murmur] [Man on phone] Yeah, well... Told you so. His references are going right out across the world, but he will be dead everywhere. The cult, got anything yet? Yeah. -One or two leads, yeah. -Right. Keep pressing hard. Now Jamie, listen, things are changing very fast, right? Technology, work patterns, the office becoming redundant. Are the inner suburbs of the future, where the middle-classes will wanna be, or is an absolutely crazy idea? A guaranteed way of losing millions and millions. I want you to answer this question, Jamie. -Me. -Yes you. We have a seminar for our prospective partners and some very important architects, just a small group of people. I want you to prepare a major presentation on the inner suburbs of the main cities of Europe and Tokyo and New York. Property prices, population movements. Violence, is it it moving more and more to the centre, fashion, which areas are regarded as sexy and which aren't. This is bigger than you realise. There are very few chances to reshape cities. We have to get ahead, don't we, to catch the moment? Great. That's exciting. You thought you were on your way out, didn't you? No [laughs awkwardly] [upbeat music] [Teenager] Hey, next time. [Lawrence] Delairo's mom. We are the only cult on this patch. Bastard. Dykes who thinks they're women. That's the only way you can get out... [people murmur] Oh, I hate this phone. Why is it this colour, I hate this colour. More than anything I hate this little button here. This fat little switch here. I mean, why can't it be round like the others. And it's got no business calling itself a phone. And what's more it's got no business being in my hand. [phone clangs] [loud thud] Now don't argue! That's great. It's got more respect for me already. Four sausage, beans and chips, please. [calm music] You see, you always turn heads when you arrive. Well, it's not difficult, right, in these clothes. Are you well? You look terrifically well. -I'm fine. -And the supplies? They are still arriving okay? Yes, you'd certainly hear if they weren't. Maybe soon I could get you some of these, our latest. Portable security. You can get a picture of your house, your car, your wife's bedroom. Make sure nobody's breaking it. That's great. [melancholic music] [traffic rumbles] They've gone out mate. -I saw them go. -Yeah, they went to do whatever they do. They went that way. [loud thumps] [women shout and jeer] Christ what a dump. This place is gonna become fashionable? [melancholic music] [Emily] That's a very successful piece of spying. You found us. It was an accident actually. -I was doing some research. -Of course. [Jamie] Well, you might not believe me, but I was. I do believe you. See, I have to give a presentation. It's kind of a lecture on how places like this are gonna become the sexy places to be -in the very near future. -Good. It sounds like a sensible topic to me. Trouble is, it's complete bullshit. No, no, no. No, there are things here I could show you that would amaze -and stun you. -Really? Show me that when. And I will when you come to our open day. Still waiting for the invitation. -Oh, you'll get a call. -Well call me then, tomorrow. I can make any day except June the fourth and fifth. Those are my big days. Someone will be in touch. -But there is one other thing. -What's that? If you haven't had an AIDS test in the last three months, get one. Well, there's no arguing with that is there. That's certainly brutally direct. Well, there's no other way of saying it is there but the open day won't be brutal. I assure you. -No, I'm sorry- -Weird isn't it? You find yourself looking at all these people and thinking about their sex lives. You just can't help yourself. Yeah, I know what you mean. I know I'd be thinking if I saw myself, I'd be thinking who on earth is he sleeping with? [chuckles] As for the doctor, he seems pleased with himself doesn't he? Lucky bastard. Judging from his age he probably had all the sex he wanted, totally unrestrained. What fun they had. [Kanahan laughs] [Forester] It raises the question [mumbles]. -You all right? -[phone rings] Sorry, I thought I switched it- Go ahead, we're almost finished here. -Yep. -I'm ringing with the date -if you still wanna come. -I'm in a meeting. -You wanna come or not? -Of course. -Right, the day's June 4th. -She would pick that date, -naturally. -Is that a yes? -Yeah. -They day begins somewhere different. Have you got a pen? I'll give you the address. It's 14 Pomeroy Road, Woolwich. Oh and one other thing. Don't eat anything for 24 hours before. Am I gonna have an operation? [Lizzie] If you want to come don't eat anything. Oh, just family, you know. Family matters. [hard rock music] What is it? It's D day. Oh. If that's how you're thinking at it I'm glad I'm not coming. Wait a minute, I thought you presentation's tomorrow, isn't it? Oh yeah, it is. But you know the whole 48 hours is important. Kinda watches everything. It's all building up to me. [men murmur] Here he comes. You're late. Very unlike you Jamie. Its quite ever seeing him late before. -John Foyer -Hi. Peter Salmon. -Debbie May. -Hi, Debbie. Jamie is our star turn for tomorrow. We took the liberty, we've ordered for you. Oh no. I should have explained. I can't eat anything. Oh. I've got a bit of a... Well, I've got a slight bowel problem, and it's best not to eat anything. Drink? You can drink can't you? I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to drink. Better not hey. She said... [everyone laughs] -Here we are. -Thank you. -Well, anyway- -Who's having the tebit? -And the guinea fowl? -Are you sure you're not gonna eat anything? I mean, who's to know. I mean, who ever is giving your medical advice, -they won't know. -No, but I'd better not. In fact really in order that I should be fighting for it, I think I'll just retire, just for the moment of course but I'll see you later without fail. [people shout] This is the open day. I leave an important power lunch for this? That's right? Fried bread. Well, maybe things are looking up. It's the best smell in the world. -Fuck I could have some. -No. What do you mean no? I've obeyed instructions so far. -Not now. -No, I said don't eat anything yet. I promise you it'll be worth it. [Micky] Do what she says, mate. I'll be disappointed. Don't say trust me because I'd don't. I know, I know you don't. But it's going to be good. I'm not that special, but it's still the best day you'll ever have spent. Talk about raising expectations. You'll never live up to that. -Just need to start with... -A portion. I don't suppose I have to do I? Well you'll have an even better time if you do. I know what it is that you're trying to do. You're trying to make me feel as welcome as possible and see what that gets you. But I'm afraid it won't do any good because I'm still gonna find a way of getting you out of your home. [Emily] We know this. I'm going to show you what's beneath the bland suburban street. Caves. I'm not sure if I'm much of a cave person actually. These are the Chislehurst caves. Are those the Chislehurst caves? [Emily] This is one of the most romantic places -in the whole country. -Oh come on. [Emily] No, the Romans lived down here. And in the civil war, the Cavaliers galloped along here. It's an escape route, they're torches burning the roof. We're off the public path now there's miles and miles of this. There's over 25 miles I think. 25 miles. [mellow music] That's the smallest meal I've ever had. -Just eat it. -Look, this isn't gonna start turning into "Alice in Wonderland," is it? I mean, I'm not gonna start shrinking suddenly or falling down a hole. You are falling, but enjoy it. [mellow music] [Jamie] What is this place? [Emily] This is Darwin's house, right in the middle of suburbia. Some would say he was the most important man that ever lived. And here he is. What else are these? You don't wanna know. But it is the safest meat you'll ever have. Safe food, but incredible food. No, come on. Tell me. Well, it's various forms of insect life from wood lice, the little tiny ones, to the real delicacy, the great diving beetle. That's the big crunchy one. It's absolutely ferocious when it's alive. And then there are several species mashed together. It's just like crab sticks. I think I'll choose to forget I heard that. Taste is phenomenal. I work for a man with an ego the size of Texas, who hates anybody having any better ideas than he does. He's a gambler. It's guys like him that build all the great cities. From New York, Paris. And I'm rubbish as two of of course [uplifting mellow music] First the Seattle Room, homage to the coffee city. I really ought to get back. [coffee rumbles] so, what's this room called? What do you suggest? Sexy Japanese room? Yeah, that will do. Must've travelled an awful lot. I mean, to be able to do all these different rooms. [Emily] No, I've never been out of the country. Really? -Not even a Spanish beach. -No. I bet you didn't get permission from the previous owner to knock all these flats together. -Yes we did. -I can get you on that. You just try. [Jamie] I need to get back. Yeah, do you want to go back? [footsteps thump] Well, we do have one rule. But it's more habit than a rule really. We gorge ourselves on telly sometimes and then we have a total fast for a whole month. And then during the month we programme the video totally at random so that at the end of the fast, -like now. -Oh right now. Yeah, see what we've caught. [TV Presenter] It's your skills that it takes to make -the quintessential piece of- -And do you know the Japanese wear bowler hat? [Jamie] Always have. Yamataka boshi. Yamataka boshi. [TV Presenter] Handcrafted hats for gentlemen. [upbeat music] And that's fucking brilliant. [upbeat music] Guess Adam and Lizzie are a couple. And occasionally Adam and Katrinna. And Megan and Katrinna are in a couple though, occasionally Katrinna is with Colin. And Colin is usually with Diana and Lawrence. And Lawrence is with Judith and also with Micky. Micky is with Lawrence and no one else. Jesus, everyone is having everybody else. No, I told if you had been listening properly. Everyone who's in a couple has one main relationship. [TV Presenter] These young people see themselves not as outside of society. So what about you Emily? Who are you with? I'm untouched. Do you have a favourite? No, don't obviously. Free love, it's a really funny expression when you think about it, isn't it? Oh so that's what you're up to. -What? -Free love. Do your own thing, whatever the phrase is... -Dropout. -What? -You're reinventing 60s- -Catchphrases. Jesus, I hope not. [Jamie] With attitude and you're right. -Of course. -Why should they have had all the fun and stop everybody else now that they're running the world. Exactly, the fucking hypocrites. [Jamie] I think, I think this is your creed. I keep telling you that we don't have a creed. But you're insisting that we do. I mean, if we do maybe it's that, maybe it's that we eat differently. [Jamie] In every sense? I think it's your bedtime. [door creaks] What are you doing here? I just come to see you. Look, I'm... I'm not expecting you. I think you got the wrong room. It's okay, relax. We don't need to do anything. Did Emily send you, is that what this is about? She doesn't make us do anything. I'm not sure if I believe that. No problem. I just wanted to be with you. You know I work. Do you? Good. On a clamping van. Clamping people's cars. Great work. I'll bet it is, it is. * I remember * * In the bell blue * * From your winter * People sound just like you do now, really pissed off. Even if it's not their car. Sometimes they come to you pointing right at eyes. You're vermin. Absolute vermin. Oh, come on for... What is this? Piccadilly circus. All right where's the camera? You're taping this for my boss, aren't you? Where have you put it? Oh yeah, it's being taped all right. The camera's there inside the anteater. Click, shock horror young executive rampant sex fiend. That's okay. Don't say you don't need to do anything. You were expecting Emily. Well, I'm not sure I was expecting anyone. Come off it. You've been sitting there all day like the boy about to get the cream. I thought it was the cat that was about to get the cream. I love watching you guys have sex. You'd do great Jamie. Not completely freaking out, just stuffing them in ever so casually. We decided then that you were okay. And I can see you using this day. Young people from the outskirts of Rome to the suburbs of Detroit have created a whole new lifestyle. I've seen the future. -I'm not a journalist. -But you're a creative thinker remember? I know I'm being seduced. So I won't be able to do anything about getting out of this building. I could be very offended by that but, I'll let it pass. I'm here because I like you. Any other effects of what happens is purely a bonus. We have a protective ring. We stop people from getting in that we don't like, we control things. But one mistake and we're probably finished. [romantic music] It's good feeling you're safe, isn't it Jamie? [romantic music] [water trickles] See... It was the best day of your life. No one seems to suffer from modesty around here. So you don't think I'm capable of much. I think you're very capable Lizzie. Very capable. It'll be okay. What will be okay? Your big presentation. -Completely unprepared. -Don't worry. What do you mean don't worry? I've hardly written any notes which I don't have with me. Shit, don't even have time to go pick them up. I haven't even prepared the slides. Don't shout, it's not my fault. Bullshit them. They won't know the difference. What do you know about it? You didn't even know these people. -You know nothing about it- -Who the fuck are they anyway? Multi-millionaire film producers or rock stars? Sorry rock star? No, they're not rock stars. [Lizzie] Then what you are worried about? You can do it, Jamie. They'll meets us there. [footsteps thump] Morning. Just need to check the slides. It's too late, mate. You should have done that already. I just switch on. I should go and sit up front. Oh Christ. This is the worst day of my life. [projector slide hums] Thank you. Could I have the first slide, please? This is the suburbs of Frankfurt. -No. -No, Cologne. -No. -Hanover. Sorry, Hanover. It's Hanover. Next please. This is Naples... I think. Turning into a spot this competition. Anyway, the important thing is... The really important thing is... Yamataka. Yes. Yamataka. Boshi. Boshi and Yamataka Yamataka boshi. That is the Japanese for bowler hat. Now why, you may well ask is that important? It is important because it is the name of the latest theory on property movement from Japan, the Yamataka boshi principle. The commuter is dead, symbolised by the English bowler hat, the maternal sign of the travelling businessman. Nowadays with everybody increasingly working at home, they don't need to commute. But what about the areas that they use to commute through? The Bronx, Queens, South London? Is it fanciful to imagine that these places could become fashionable, that theatres, that opera houses could be built there? This is what lies at the heart of the Yamataka boshi principle. Because these places, even in this city have an allure, a hidden charm. You look at them, ladies and gentlemen, look at them, and you look at the future. Come here, I wanna show you something. Look at this. Fucking hell, he's making a whole new city. This is just the beginning. Everything goes well with the building, and after listening to that... After listening to that, you and I need to talk Jamie. Sure, of course. Will tomorrow do, because I got a doctor's appointment in 15 minutes. -[car honks] -Oi, move. Move over you wanker! Fucking matter with you hey? [angry driver shouts] Move over you... Come on, pull over, wanker. [tyres screech] Right, you're fucking dead. Get out of the fucking car! [suspenseful music] -Wanker! -Another time. [melancholic music] -Where are we going? -We've never tried to get into this place before. -So why now? -For your benefit. We've come to discuss matters of mutual interest. This is a bog standard cult. The end of the world is nigh. Everything is connected to the movement of the seasons, you know so they're only allowed to call their families in the spring. The only way they can guarantee their salvation is by giving all their money to Mr. Delario. When we meet them in the street, it's a really weird scene. It's so serious. They're never quite sure to send them up or not. [water splashes gently] I hope we're not intruding. We've come to make an appointment, -matters of mutual concern. -Yeah, the likes of us, we're thinking of starting cult news, a cult appointments agency, maybe even a cult cricket team. And of course, more serious matters to discuss as well. Francesco says, will you have tea with him? [Jamie] Why are most of them looking at me. Because you're the only normal one here. Has anyone ever called you that before come? Come on while all these creeps are right here lets go and have a look and see what they're hiding. I believe Emily, if I may call you that, we set the standards. We are the future. There's corruption everywhere. The politicians, the financiers, we alone have purity, courage, and that word that outsiders find so obscene, discipline. [Lizzie] You're missing tea. So Emily, do you agree with this? It has echoes for us, definite echoes. -It sounds chords. -Chords? Yes, sustained chords. [Lizzie] What's this? Fucking hell. I hate to think what these are used for? Maybe every cult comes complete with it's own poison gas now. Jesus, Jamie, we're so far behind in every way. [footsteps thump] I found these two in illegal areas. Really, and what were you doing in illegal areas? -My fault. -We were spying. She will be disciplined. Without a doubt. They could see you were pissing yourselves in there. [Lizzie] No, they couldn't. They've got no idea at all. They're never gonna touch us. It's a big moment you realise, you're gonna see her room. Is it that much of a honour? [chuckles] It's like winning the lottery. -What you expected? -Yeah, pretty much. She gonna neutralise him over. What are the odds do you think? -Hmm? -Neutralise? That's one way of putting it I suppose. It's gonna be difficult though. After he had what he came for. I don't trust him. I mean, he's not gonna run off to New Zealand like the schmuck is he? It's a brilliant idea Emily. Really is brilliant. Thank you but which particular idea of mine are you talking about? The group. You take on a form of a cult, it's fantastic. Like all animals do. [chuckles] Thank you. Well you know snakes, insects, of which are so fond, Lizards, that sort of thing, you know. The point is some of them pretend to be poisonous when they're not. Great, stops you from getting eaten. I love it, I love it because it's really, it's really audacious. You get freedom, you get power, but it's genuinely dangerous. I think that you're the only danger to us actually, because you're the one trying to get us out of this building. I have to get you out, that's right. -Do you? -Yes. Or I'll never work again. My boss sees this building as the beginning of something rather colossal. And even if you do manage to deal with me, he'll only send somebody worse. Someone who will be merciless. How can anyone be merciless? We have a legal right to be here. I can get you out on moral grounds tomorrow. They are several young people here indulging in various sexual practises. Now some of their ages will be very interesting to check. I mean, that boy with the dreadlocks, what's his name? -Colin. -They'll never get us out on that. It wouldn't be difficult to portray you as some kind of monster. You think I'm a monster? No, but I think you're a little frightening. I wish all life was here. Where are your parents for instance? I bet they're sort of bohemian literary types aren't they? Disowned you by now I should think. Probably wanted you to work on some posh Sunday newspaper. I'd love to see you in office, [chuckles] refusing to a bail authority like you do. Have you ever been in an office? [woman speaks in a foreign language] [people murmur] Get to know all your secrets. [melancholic music] [birds chirp] Do you think he slept with her? It's possible. He's quite attractive, for a property developer. Can I be very old fashioned. I want to get you some breakfast. So you wear those clothes even when there's no one around? Yeah. Why not? Get to love them. Anyway you're here. -How old are you? -Old enough. -Where do you come from? -I come from Oxford. Take these. -A present. -Thanks. Something I don't understand. I mean, how did the four of you join? I mean, I can understand her Katrinna, -but how about- -What, you think I look -crazy enough do you? -Yeah. Emily was the only one who didn't think I was crazy. I was in a really bad way before I met her, working in a filthy hotel in Kings Cross. All right. And the rest of you? You're a bit conventional aren't you? 'Cause we're not all drug, crazed teenagers with syringes sticking out of our arms. What are we doing here? [Jamie] Couldn't put it better myself. Met her at a bus stop. I lived in South London all my life, never met anyone like Emily. If you take any railway carriage, have you ever been in a railway carriage? Yeah. -Once or twice. -Well in any railway carriage you find at least two people with the most amazing life stories, I mean stuff you can't even imagine. Me, my small business when it was swoony so they say, but Diana there, oh good, now there's a story. [chuckles] Not really. It just involved Oxford and a lot of drugs. An affair with a psychopathic don who wanted to kill his best friend and a mini bus. You can stay as long as you like today. Excuse me. [melancholic music] [car door bangs] [footsteps thump] [door bell rings] You've gone back to spying? Well I'm not having a scene now so you better come in. Well, we better make tea for your young man right now Emily because your father has things to do soon. Okay, mom. Have you seen the new shopping mall in Denver Street? It's built just like the old crystal palace. It really is a glass castle with this big dome. And on certain days, from a distance, you view from a real distance, it looks magical. I must organise an outing for us, you know, like new attractions of the district. I don't like going out, the streets are filthy. Everything's filthy. So how long are you and your young man staying because your father will be hungry soon? [footsteps thump] -Emily? -What right have you to follow me here? I was curious. Well, of course you were curious, but it doesn't give you the right to- Well I don't know, I got the idea that you might be going to meet your source. My source? What the fuck is that? Your source, where you get your money from or the equipment that you sell. Listen... Listen, Emily before you get really angry. -I am really angry- -Okay, all right. You're angry. I'm sorry. I can't get used to wearing that. Is this the only time you didn't wear black? You ran down in the street to ask me that? No, I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna stall them, delay my boss. I'm not gonna let them evict you. Fuck it, you take risks all the time. Why the fuck shouldn't I? Now I'm gonna take the bastard on. You weren't here this morning? No, I'm sorry about that. You know I had to go and get myself better so. Made a couple of calls about this yamataka, yama, -yamataka. -Yamataka boshi. Theory of the bowler hat. You know, nobody's heard of it. No, well it's a very new, it's recent academic paper so... [Kanahan] You got a copy you can let me see? Sure. At home, sure. I love it anyway. -Good. -I love it. The yama... -[chuckles] the- -Yamataka. Yamataka principal. I'm gonna use it myself, refer to it. Great. And your whole talk, you can let me have a copy -of that too. -Well, you didn't record it? No sure, I'll try. You've had a good look at what I've really got in mind. Yeah. Well, I think it's amazing. I decided to throw a lot more money at it. This is a major gamble. Jamie, a great deal could depend on it. My presentation wasn't responsible for it going through was it? [chuckles] It certainly contributed. Well. Right at the time has come Jamie to get these weirdos out, okay. Flush them out. Well, I've got that in hand. I've discovered that they are a religious sect, a very austere religious order following a set of beliefs, tied to the seasons. When we get to Halloween, we'll find that they'll move of their own accord to find another resting place. Halloween, are you out of your mind? We can't wait till Halloween. But it's just that they will move like a bee's nest or whatever. No. No, it's out of the question. I need to see how quickly these flats go. I refuse to wait, all right? All right, we'll get some people in and start doing the buildings up right. That will make so much dust and noise, we'll try them out that way. Well I wouldn't do that because the risk of the group vandalising our work would be too great. I mean, if we provoke them, if we do that, -it would cost us money. -Then we must find something on them, all right. Nobody is that clean. Fine, I will. I mean, I'm just saying that because of their austerity, they, things have a natural rhythm and well, they only talk at certain times so. [Kanahan laughs] No more bullshit? Bullshit, what do you mean? About Halloween. Seasonal crap. -Don't let them bullshit you. -No, no, absolutely. [Kanahan] Good. [traffic rumbles] That was amazing. I mean, your talk. I mean the sheer chutzpah. Actually I have to confess that, I don't remember a single I said no. You know what, whatever you're taking, its obviously working. [footsteps thump] Aren't these some of the women from the building? Yeah, yeah, I think they are. Either of you fine gentleman want a camcorder. No, thank you. Yep, yeah, let's have a look. This is, yeah, well this is a time I haven't seen before. Sorry, you have all met. -We met once. -Yeah. So, are there any famous people in here? What about them? They worth knowing? Come on, let's go. Lizzie, come on. Right so, what is an obscure religious sect doing -with all that equipment? -Well, I didn't know. I've never seen them with that stuff before. Will you excuse me? [water splashes] [Lizzie] You didn't want a camera, sir? What the fuck are you doing? It's okay, you can relax. There's nobody here. [door bangs] -Shh. -See, I told you, there's nobody here. What, I never [mumbles]. If you wanna talk, we'll do it outside. Well why do you suggest we talk, huh? Why can't you be seen with me? Are you gonna invite me to your table then? [people murmur] You see, well it was a good idea, wasn't it? Lizzie, what are you doing here? Christ sake, I spent half my time portraying you as practically a group of nuns and you turn up here looking like that for God's sake. Well, it's just a short visit. -Aren't you pleased to see me? -Yes. Or do you think I should stay where I belong? -No, I didn't mean that. -Didn't you? No. You think you can have both don't you? After all you've found something close to paradise. I'm sure it's ever young executive's fantasy, isn't it. You can lead a double life, it's terrific. Come and tuck in any time you feel like it and then get rid of us totally whenever you want. And of course, we aren't allowed to put in any inconvenient appearances on your territory. Or are we? Lizzie... No, I'm not gonna do this. I'm not gonna start having sex with you in the line cupboard at my local brasserie. -You reckon? -Yeah. Why? Clean school gets dirty cupboards. Yeah. And the door won't lock. We have a protected rule remember? Nobody crosses it. You're safe. Hardly. [mellow music] You think I'm capable, remember. I'm not just capable of this. If I showed you some of my work, -would you look at it for me? -Your work? Well, yeah. You didn't just think we flogged Japanese stuff did you? Of course I don't. Yeah, right, of course. [Jamie whispers] They are sending new management from Japan, but if I can get away with it, with those new people, we can go on for as long as we can. Forever. -Or until you go back. -Yes, one day, I will go. But till then you can build a bigger group. I have to keep seeing you, I love seeing you. I know. I know that. Sometimes in the middle of a meeting, I find myself thinking of you. And big, stupid grin appears on my face. People look at me. They have no idea why I looks so happy. I need those moments. Those are the time when I feel free, thinking of you. You have no rules, you are free. [uplifting music] -Come on attend Jamie. -He's been on another planet ever since his presentation was such a triumph. Not true. Come on Jamie, you can chop these. [upbeat rock music] [people shout] [Rowdy Teenage Boy] Just wasn't the right moment, -you know what I mean? -Yeah, yeah, you're right. -It wasn't quite right. -We'll get them. -Sometime. -Yeah, next time hey. What are these? -Oh, those are nothing. -What do you mean nothing? I haven't seen those before. -They look- -Yes. -They almost look- -They are what they look like. They were given to me by foreign client. And we ought to eat them before they go off. We could have them with the Parma ham tonight. Oh, but... -Go away. -[women screams] [mellow music] Maybe we should you go back another way. Don't be stupid. It's only the kids. No, something is not right here. Emily, listen to me. Don't! [Emily] Come on you guys, get out the way. You know us, you know who we are. Yeah, we know you. We know who you are. You're just shit, that's what you are. Shit. [loud thud] [sticks clatter] [dramatic rock music] So what the fuck is up with you? Don't ever, ever think... [dramatic rock music] [footsteps thump] This time we got them, we really go them this time. They can't do anything. They can't hurt you, don't you see? They can't do anything to us. They can't hurt ya. -Oi, assholes. -Oi, what are doing? Don't you dare, don't you dare come any closer than that. [people scream and shout] Come on, get them. Get the little turds, smash their tiny faces in. Come on, get them. Come on, come on. Come on. They deserve it, the little bitch. Come on. Crush them! Whack them crush them! Come on! Get off me! [loud thud] [Rowdy Teenage Boy] You gonna die you fucking bastard. [people shout and cry] -We can do it one at a time. -Come on. -Come on. -Mate, you take this. [Man Grey T-Shirt] Next time I'll get inside you. [train rumbles] [men shout] [men exclaim] [suspenseful music] Micky? Micky? Micky, you gonna be all right, okay? [doors rumble] And that is what makes the weather warmer. Oh, not the weather again. -[phone rings] -Or is it colder? -Anyway- -Please switch that off. -Sorry. -If it's Kanahan, tell him where he can go. Jamie? You've got to come. -Something's happened. -Tell him to bugger off. Yeah, all right. [Emily] Please don't give me that next of kin bureaucracy crap. Will you just tell me how he is? Just write it down. You know what happened, I've told you so many times. I know what you said. Yeah, you pushed him and then kicked him in the head. Oh come on. [people murmur] [sombre music] [Man In Blue Jacket] Were you at the match darling? Did you see anything? Are you sure you weren't there? -No, I wasn't. -Pity, she'd have made a good picture. [camera hums] [sombre music] You okay? How are you? Are you hurt? No, we're fine now. Everything's okay. Micky is in hospital, he's okay. Lizzie, they've just told me that Micky is okay. Good. That's good. Why are you here? It wasn't necessary to send for you. -We can manage things. -I sent for him. It was a crazy thing to do, I admit it. Well there must be something I can do now that I'm here. I mean, how are the police behaving themselves? Have they found the people who did it? No, of course not. Lizzie, where are you going? What do you mean where am I going? I'm going to sample the attractions at the hospital. Isn't that allowed? I told you didn't I? I told you not to go near those boys but of course you wouldn't listen because you always know better, don't you? You think that you can stop anybody from doing anything. Lizzie nothing's really changed. You'll see. You sure you're okay? Yes, everything's fine. You should get back to what you're doing. I don't want to that. [people shout] They'll go away, don't worry. You know when it doesn't work, it's worse than... [Emily] Worse than what? It's being what it was before we met. Unemployed female, qualifications nil, social skills nil, attitude bad. Part time fucking junkie. Just this once it didn't work, okay. It won't happen again. What you thinking about? Nothing really. I know this can't go on forever. What we have is always on the edge. But we have a chance right now to have one of the best times that we've ever had. How? You'll see. [people shout and chant] [suspenseful music] [birds chirp] [Lizzie] I guess they did realise we're taking the piss. Now, they've come in once. Will they do it again? It's not very imaginative is it? We'll get rid of it soon enough. [sombre music] She just won't listen will she? [melancholic music] Lizzie, is it? Hello. It's a funny place to choose. Well you think your new mates will see you here with me in case I turn out to be a real nutter. -Is that it? -Well I now you're not a complete nutter. You just managed to track me down. So you're an important journalist, are ya? She's like nobody I've ever met before. I mean, the group was, is a fantastic idea. I mean, keeping the world at bay, all the shit and the violence by giving out conflicting messages. That's how Emily puts it, both sex and not available. Come on and puritanism, it frightens people. Yeah, but Lizzie you have to give me more about what goes on there? I mean, could Madonna happen again? I mean, in the same way now the sex is more dangerous. You didn't expect me to philosophise, did you? Emily's taught me everything I know. And maybe that's the problem. I mean, just think about it. All the equipment we've got is fantastically valuable. And nobody's robbed us or attacked us. Not till now anyway. Because we scared shitless. [boxes rumble] Sex Lizzie, tell me about the sex. Wanna know about the sex? Jesus, that is a surprise. You all slept with each other? Not all, no. And everybody did everything? Men with men, and girls with girls? They very young, the not so young? Yeah, why not? The ultimate safe sex? You know, we all knew we were disease free. We all knew we weren't having it anywhere else. She encouraged you, she recruited you? Well, she didn't seduce us if that's what you mean. No, it was quite the other way around. Lizzie I need more. -More? -The ages of some of the kids there, and the drugs. Well, there were plants and food from all over the world. Look, I know what you want. [melancholic music] You can use some of these. I could be a model, don't you think? This is about my future after all. Oh sure, of course we can use them. Yeah, well you better mean it. See if you ask the right questions... Crazy girl. Oh, you got new supplies? Great. Yeah, make the punter's hair stand on end. Emily, I'm just gonna nip to the shops. There's a few things I need to get. -I won't be very long okay? -Okay. This Madam sin of the 90s preys on the young, under the camouflage of heading a austere religious group. -It isn't- -She procures young people for selling goods in the street and for sex. -Take a seat- -It isn't true. -The story is not true. -How do you know? I know. She does not recruit or prey on people. She's in her own way a very creative person, a role model. -A role model, really? -Yes. On how to live in one of the most violent parts of the city. Did you spend a night there, Jamie? -Yeah. -You did. And you still think it's not true? But it isn't. I can tell you the real story. No, thanks. For our purposes this is quite true enough. Am I fired? Why should I fire you, Jamie? That'd be too easy. By chance you've pushed me into the biggest gamble of my life. I quite like your unpredictability. You might have an interesting idea one day and you might persuade me to let you carry it out. Things have been taken care of now with the building just so long as you don't interfere with that. Don't even think about trying to help them. Some of these weirdos are really rather attractive, but just ever so slightly decadent, hey Jamie. It's very irresponsible. Well, you must have had some pretty wild times back in the 60s. I mean, you must have had lots of partners. I imagine you really picked yourself, didn't you? Oh you're dead right Jamie. And weren't we lucky sods. Oh, that's the barrel. It's from Madagascar. [phone beeps] [people murmur] It's great coffee here. How old is the youngest member here? -Youngest member? -How old? I don't know, we could go and ask him. [Forester] Jamie? -What? -Jamie? Felicity for you here. [Felicity] I thought we might all go for a drink. Christ, what is this? National watch Jamie day? I mean Christ, how can you stand working here in the centre of town? This isn't where the future is. Future is somewhere else. Somewhere that will take your breath away. Jamie, what's happened to you. I got to go. -Jamie? -Look, I'm going. -Jamie? -I'll see you. -Jamie, for fuck's sake! -Jamie! -Did they hurt you badly? -No, I'm okay. -You tell her. -Tell her what? -Tel Emily not to do this. -She's going after Lizzie. You're just in time. You've got a habit of doing that. Leave her alone please. This will go badly. Don't go. No, it's okay Jamie. We're just gonna pay her a visit. I know what I'm doing. She's gone, all right. -She's gone. -Yeah, but things aren't that simple with Lizzie. Have you seen what she did? No, they twisted her words. And besides, it was only a local paper. It's not as if we're besieged by hacks from all over the country. Anyway, she's always wanted a little bit of fame. What, for sticking pictures up on her bedroom wall? No, no, no. She's quite talented. Sometimes very talented. Here's the room you've never seen [hopeful music] [metal squeaks] This is her work, and Lawrence's. I'm sure he thinks how passe, how first year art school. I don't actually. I think it's great. [Emily] We've got some unfinished business, both with Lizzie and to make sure we're never attacked again. He looks okay. [melancholic music] [car doors bang] [Emily] We'll go in the main entrance this time. I'm sure they'll be glad to see us. [Jamie] Looks like we arrived at party time. -This is a private moment. -Good, then I'll keep it simple. We have come with a peaceful solution. You entered our space and defiled it. There was no sanction from me to do that. Of course not. There never is. But for now we wish to demonstrate our goodwill. We have these tokens to show the resources we command. We want you to rejoice in these gifts. [Francesco] All gifts are always presented directly to Francesco so we can share equally. Oh, that's the kind of sharing I really understand. All these things and you... You can take them out. You can keep it all to yourself, but the door is over that way. Do you know what these are worth outside? You could live for months and be worth a fortune again. [people murmur] Go on, take it, please. It's yours, take it. Go on. I won't tolerate this sort of behaviour. Nobody is allowed to come in here and stir up feelings. I will to be provoked by this! All these things are not be collected and brought here now. Right now! Just bring them here! And get this scum out of here! [soft thuds] [mellow music] Let's not go to town. Let's not go after Lizzie, please. Oh no, we've got to go. Besides we all know where she is. When we turn back. [upbeat rock music] [truck rumbles] [people murmur] It's working now. As long as you stay up here. What, you're trying to give me lessons now? No, I wanna join the group? No. Yes. Here and now, complete membership. [chuckles] No, it wouldn't work for you. You wouldn't last a week. I promise you you're better off staying at Gold Lee's and trying to subvert them from the inside. No, I'm going to join. We could run a very successful operation. I mean it Emily. It's because of you. You've converted me. To hell with what happens to my career. Emily, please don't go down there, please. Please. -I'll just be a moment. -Please. [people murmur] [cutlery clangs] What are you doing here? No, don't make a scene here Emily, you understand? [Emily] Is that what you think I'm gonna do? Yeah. Can I sit here for a minute? No! No, Emily you can't. In case you hadn't noticed, we're actually trynna have a meal. I'm sorry about this guys. [Man] Yeah, well just excuse me. No, you don't have to go. Well don't be long. Now Lizzie, listen to me. I understand about the paper. -I know that they- -No you don't. They didn't twist my words. I knew exactly what I was doing. The only thing I didn't realise is that it was only gonna appear in the local bloody paper. Well, I just want us to complete- Complete? Emily, what is there to complete? I mean, for God's sake Emily, you practically had to fuck that Japanese guy every time to get us more product. You tell me how is that any different when you're going out into the street right now and you're up against the wall with some passing trade? That is rubbish, he never wanted anything from me. And don't want to tell me we were free because we weren't. It's not possible to live any different. That's what our experiment proved. It was a great trial, I'll give you that. You know we had our fun all right. -I'm sorry about this. -It's all right. Listen to me, Lizzie. Those four dirty words. How many times have I heard those? I am not telling you how to run your life, -but you must- -Just think of me as some stupid bimbo who wanted the bright lights. I don't care. I know you think I'm your protege, well I'm not. -I really am not. -Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry. -I'm just gonna move the- -Only way you can continue now is to bully and to bullshit. That makes you no different from Delario now- I'll promise never to be like that. Look, can you just stop it. Leave us alone for Christ's sake! I have to talk to my friend. Get away! Fucking get away from me. Aren't you ashamed? Aren't you really ashamed of what you've just done? What are you gonna do, spend your entire time making it impossible for me to go into places? Well I can tell you something. -You're fucking not. -Don't you dare -talk me like that. -No, just get away from me. -Christ's sake- -Don't you dare talk to -like that! -Back to where you belong! Just look at you in these clothes. Don't you realise how pathetic it is. You're nothing, fucking nothing. And I don't ever, ever wanna see you again, do you hear me? Don't you ever fucking, ever come near me again. It's over. Emily, just leave me alone. -It's over. -Lizzie! What are you gonna do? I don't want you. She's right, it's fucking over. [Emily sobs] Emily, just let her go. [sombre music] [melancholic music] Well, they created this world which was safe and imaginative and romantic. Oh, Jesus. You really have got it bad, haven't you? I'm telling you I was never as happy -as when I was with them. -What? It's just I realised too late of course. Jamie, you have to let it go otherwise- Otherwise what, I'll go crazy or something. Is that what you're saying? I'm not letting go. No way. [loud thud] [people murmur] Jesus, you guys don't hang around do you? [loud thuds] [sombre music] You shouldn't be here. Well I am. What are you gonna do? You going to take me in your manly arms and carry me off. I hardly think so. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Come on. [soft door knock] Kiss me. -You don't want to. -Of course I do. -I was a bit surprised. -That I gave the invitation? Yeah. [romantic gentle music] [Emily pants] So you finally got to sleep with her. When her resistance was lowered. [chuckles] That's right. Was it worth it? No don't answer that. Let's get some proper clothes once it's light, if I'm gonna stay here for awhile. Oh, there you are. I've been waiting for you to be awake. Jamie, now listen. Well, maybe I shouldn't say that anymore. I've got to go now. -Already? -Yes. I can't live like this even for a few hours. What do you mean, I'm so irredeemably middle class. so hopelessly bourgeois that even one day is enough? No, no, no. No, it's just that, I'm just seriously crazy. No you're not. The least crazy. No, you don't think that I am and that's why I like you so much. But I can't be what I'm not and neither can you. -But we can try. -No, we can't. No. No, I'm sorry about that scene in the restaurant. No, I'm not, I'm not. Love makes us behave foolishly and there it is. I can't be that different, can I? I'll see you. Just like that, you'll see me. You can't be as abrupt as that. Yes, I can. I'll see you. How? Well, you know. I hope it will be like this. I really hope. But, you'll be going along the street, some fairly ordinary street. And you'll see these silver rubbish bags. No one ese I know will make rubbish bags seem so romantic. [Emily] You're in a taxi and you're going along this street past some hamburger place. And you look up in the window because you think that maybe you see something. [romantic music] And? [Emily] And... [romantic music] [door bangs] You will Jamie. [upbeat music] [melancholic music]
