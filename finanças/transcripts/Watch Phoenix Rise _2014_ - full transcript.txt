(pop R&B music) * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise * Growing up I never had much * That didn't stop me from chasin' dreams * In my mind I always knew that I could fly * There will always be someone around to bring you down * And something in your way * Just focus and one day you'll find your wings * You must reach high and touch the sky * Stand tall let the world the know * That you can have it all * The only thing stopping you * Is you * Work hard and do what you got to do * It doesn't matter where I come from * Or what other people do to me * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise * It doesn't matter what I've been through * There are people who believe in me * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise - [Voiceover] My name is Pheonix and for as long as I can remember I had a best friend named Angel. I guess I should start from the beginning. Angel and I both grew up in the flatlands of Oakland, California. We didn't grow up in the projects or anything like that, but we damn sure were in the hood. My mother passed away when I was real young so I lived with my grandmother and my cousin Sasha. Angel lived next door with her mother and her mother's boyfriend. I had to protect her from the older boys in the neighborhood, they were always trying to talk to her and touch on her. Where we grew up, girls weren't allowed to be all girly. We used to steal from the corner store and be just as aggressive as the boys. Angel's mom and her boyfriend were always fighting when we got home. She used to say it was time for round one when his 40-ounce bottle was empty, so Angel and I spend a lot of time together at my grandmother's house. Since I was named Phoenix and her name was Angel we kind of figured we could fly out the ghetto with our wings. So we made up a poem that we could recite to ourselves. - [Both] No matter how bad, or how hard the times, I will have faith in what's right and the power of my mind. Work hard and success will come in due time. These are my wings and with those I will rise. (sighs) - I wish I didn't have to take this stupid algebra test tomorrow. - That's why we're studying now. Hope after I go tell Keisha to leave me alone in English class. - Are Keisha Big Behind messin' with you? Man she a punk. Want me to come to your class and hit her on her belly? - No, I'll just avoid her. - It's just like out her in the streets when we see some dope fiend or some shady-looking dude, you know, carry yourself like you ain't no punk. So next time she say something to you, you gotta get your mean mug on and tell her kick rocks. Deep East on mine, brah. - Watch your mouth, young lady. I don't wanna hear none of that street talk in my house. - Sorry, Grandma. - Alright, Grandma, the baby's in the crib, I'm out. - Hold on, Miss Thang. I've already had my babies, that little boy is your responsibility. - Grandma, stop trippin', I'm 'a be back when I get back, kay? - You... - Okay? - I swear, that girl's gonna be the death of me. Onto the streets and bein' fast. So, what are you girls doin'? - Oh, we're studying for a math test. - That's my girls, Phoenix and Angel. I can't wait 'til you both fly out of here and make your mark on the world. - We're gonna take you with us, Grandma. - Yeah, who else is gonna make us banana pudding? - [Grandma] Oh, that reminds me. I got food cookin'. - Is your cousin droppin' out of school? I haven't seen her in like a month. - She hang out with those grown men, like those dudes that be sellin' crack, but don't tell anybody or Grandma. She took one of those at-home pregnancy tests. - But she just had a baby. - [Grandma] Phoenix! (Angel gasps) What did I tell you about leavin' the milk out? Baby, what's wrong? - You startled her. - [Grandma] Girl, hush. What's that on your arms? Where did these bruises come from? Angel, is somebody hurtin' you? I swear, it's bad enough he does it to you-- - [Phoenix] Grandma, don't trip. But, can Angel spend the night? - Of course she can. I'll let you two get back to studying. (church bells ringing) - Hey, ugly girl. Where my Nelly CD? - Boy who's you callin' ugly? I'm prettier than anybody in your whole family. (laughs) - Somebody lied to you, you ain't half as pretty as your light-skinned partner. - Yeah, whatever, that's why you're not getting your CD back. You don't need it anyway, your granny don't let you listen to rap. - Man, my granny don't run me. I'm only 12 and I'm out here gettin' money. My cousin be on the spot every day after school. - Boy, you stupid. You gonna end up in juvie. You a church boy, you need to be in choir practice. - Man, I need to get my skrill. Watch in a few months, I'm gonna come through with some hella clean, bump it. Yeah. And I'm 'a park right in front of your grandma house and pick up your hoochie-ass cousin. - First it's my best friend, now it's my cousin? Make up your mind, dummy. - I'm a pimp, I can have both of them. And next time I see you you better have my CD, punk. - Shut up before I talk to your granny, buster. (screaming) - Woman, have you lost your damn mind? How you gonna tell me I can't have no money? I want me a drink, get me a drink! Gimme this. - [Woman] Here, take it, take it! Just leave us alone! - Stop, you can do that to my mother. No, stop! - You little slut, How y'all nothin. - Get off her! - You worthless. - No! - Just like your-- (smashes) (panting) Hah, you see that there? You see that? That's what I'm talkin' about. I'm gonna have to teach your homegirl a lesson, too. - Come one step further and I will blow your woman-beating ass off the face of God's great earth. - It's like that? You and your granddaughter, get the Hell out of my damn house. This ain't none of your business, no way. - It's my business now. So look here, young blood, I already called the police. So you can leave now before they here, or test me at my word. (panting) - [Voiceover] Angel and her mother stayed with us that night. By the time I got home from school the next day they were gone. My grandmother told me they had to leave for their safety, and that was the last time it came up. I did it. I graduated high school, I got accepted into UCLA and I wasn't pregnant. That's really an accomplishment where I come from But then the reality of poverty hit and my grandmother told me that we couldn't afford the tuition. I thought I was too pretty to get a job, I wanted to be a model and get in some music videos, and maybe marry a basketball player. My cousin, Sasha, had already been featured in some local videos, and I begged her to help me get in one. - Girl, I can't waste it and do my makeup in here. I ain't never been in a music video before, and you know I'm gonna show it to all my hair. - Girl, I can't wait to see who the artist is. You know I never met a famous rapper before. - Mm-mm, I don't care who it is, once they see me move, they gonna make me wifey. - Sit your fast ass down. (lauging) And save some of that energy for tonight. (laughing) - Alright. Dang, it's about time, Sasha, can we get this meeting started already? - Oo, don't worry about me honey. The meeting will start when I start it. So, Phoenix, look. We want you to do this video with us tonight. - For real? Oh my God. Who the artist? Too Short or E-40? - Uh-uh, girl, this a new video for Tony Macaroni and XXL New Joint. Yeah, all be comin' Trap Spot. (rapping, hip hop beat) - Tony, Tony, XXL, that what good right there. Assistant! Eh, let's take a break while we light up the next shot. Hey you, go get your makeup touched up and come back for some close-ups. - Oh, hi, the director wants me to get my makeup touched up. Can you do it for me? - Uh-huh. Have a seat. I meant to tell you, you got some nice hair. You didn't ask but my name is Eileen Fonteneaux. I was raised in the country but I got all my guys in the city. You know how they say keep it one hundred? Well I keep it like a hundred thousand. (laughs) All day, every day. - You're a trip. How long you been doing makeup? - Mm, I've been doing makeup for my mom and my aunties since I could hold a mirror straight. Then I started doin' hair, eyebrows, nails, toes, I have a whole outfit if you need it. - Dang, what don't you do? - Girl if there's something I can't do I haven't found it yet. You should come down to my shop. - Oh yeah. - I have purses, weave, girl, whatever, it's down on McAurthur like when you're going towards the San Diego border, I'll give you a card. - [Sasha] What's up, Eileen? - Hey, girl. - I need to come by the hair shop and change my hair color next week. - It's good, just let me know, okay. - You know this my little cousin, right? - Oh, this one? Here I am thinkin' you're a good girl. - I am a good girl. - Not if you hang out with this one and her crew. - Now don't hate. Look, Phoenix. I need you to get your mind right, 'cause I got Boss Beat coming over here to talk to you. (mumbles) - Who? - Boss Beat, girl he a dope dealer slash rap label owner. I worked on a few of his videos. He a cool dude. As long as he get what he wants. You get what I'm sayin'? - [Boss] Sasha tellin' me to come on home, what's good? Eileen, Eileen, girl you know you too caked up to be doin' this. - What's up, Boss. I'm gonna go get my other brushes. - Yeah, who you is? - Oh, hi I'm Phoenix. - Yeah I'm Boss Beat, you already know what it is. Yeah, I like the way you was lookin' out there. - Oh really? Thank you, you know I tried. You see it's my first video shoot. I'm just thankful for the opportunity. - Okay well check this out, man, I got this new rap group, the Turf Gods, and they got this new single called Blist and Blop. They're shooting a video next week, and I'm gonna try to get you in to feature, yeah. Yeah, you seen that black Hummer? That's all me. Meet me in the back in five minutes, we'll see if you can drive it low. - Meet you in the back in your car? - Yeah. Get them panties off, that ain't the axle. - Sasha, Sasha! Come here, hurry up! - [Sasha] What girl? - Girl, Boss Beat just told me to meet him the back of his Hummer with no drawers on! - Damn, girl. - [Phoenix] I know, right! - Your first day on the job and you hooked the big one. Mm, you make me proud. Here, take this. And tell him it cost five hundred. Just bring me back 150 and we straight. - Damn - Phoenix. Where you goin'? (hip hop music) - [Grandma] Hey baby, what you doin'? - Nothin', watchin' music videos. - [Grandma] Mm-hm, and eatin' all my nuts I see. - Sorry, Grandma. - What song is this? - Oh, this that new video by Young Ludva Ludva, ah ah. You ain't heard this on the radio? This is my jam. - It sound kinda nasty. Who's that girl right there? She looks kind of famliar. - [Phoenix] Oh her? That's my hero. Her name is Essence. She been in all the biggest videos. Trayson, Luda, Jay-Z, Kanye, and she from Oakland, alright, I'm saying. - Hm, I know that girl. And her name ain't no Essence. That's Aisha Stevens. I used to babysit her all the time. Her mother was a member of the church for a while. - Granny, you lyin', oh my... You gotta hook it up so I can meet her! Oh my God, she can introduce me to all the rappers, the ball players, the actors, she know everybody! Oh, she even in this month of Kiss Magazine. Look, see, they got pictures of her hosting this party in LA. - Huh, looks like little Aisha's doin' good for herself. Huh. What happened to you and your cousin bein' in music videos? (sighs) - I don't even wanna talk about it. I'm not even talkin' to Sasha or any of her ugly partners. - I'm not even gettin' the middle of that. You're grown, and she's grown with two kids. But whatever she's doin' is payin' the bills. She came in here the other day, gave me some money, and brought some outfits for the boys. - Good for her. - Well yes it is good. It's always good to bring home some money. The water, lights, food, clothes, ain't none of that free. - Are you tryin' to tell me something? - Yes, baby, I love you, but since you're not goin' to school, you need to get a job. - Granny, don't you watch the news? We in a recession. There ain't no jobs out there. - Phoenix, quit bein' all dramatic. Now there's a man at the church, a nice brother named Marcus. He's got his own business and he needs a receptionist. he left his information in the church bulletin. Let me go find it. - Grandma, wait. You don't gotta go do that. I don't even know this man, and I don't know anything about being a receptionist. - Hah, as much as you run your mouth on the phone and be on that computer, you'll pick it up. Now I'm gonna go find his information, and you're gonna call him for an interview. - So you're really gonna sit there and act like you don't see me? - Sasha, I don't have anything to say to you. - Whatever, Phoenix, you're my little cousin. You can't ignore me forever. I practically raised you, okay? - No, Granny raised me, boo. - Really? So did Granny walk you to school every day? Mm-hmm. Where was Granny when them girls was tryin' to jump you back in junior high school? Or when you wanted your first weave? - Look, Sasha, we were both young then, okay? But we grown now, and I ain't about to get down with what you do. - So what you mean by that? You can't get down with gettin' money? Check this out. I had my first baby when I was 14. So I didn't have the luxury of gettin' an education. I ain't got no momma just like you ain't got no momma. So I had to figure it out on my own, Phoenix. Shoot, Granny had people at the church givin' my baby clothes and food. Do you know how embarrassin' that is? When I had the second baby, I promised myself I wasn't gonna take another handout no matter what I had to do. So at 17 I went over to San Francisco, and start shakin' my ass at the strip club. Yeah, do you really think I enjoy shakin' my ass for dirty old men? Hell naw. But my babies got new Jordans on they feet and they ain't never gonna go hungry. - Okay, I understand all that, Sasha, but I don't want to go down that road. I have a dream, okay? I want to be something. - So what you sayin'? I ain't nothin'? You know what, honey? I used to have dreams, too, and then guess what? I woke up in the real world where both of my baby daddies left me at. I woke up in the real world where I was a pretty black girl with a nice body and no education. So that only left me with a couple of options. I don't know why I'm talkin' to you. Your silly ass still living in the world of lollipops and ponytails. You might look down on me and my friends, honey, but guess what? I go to sleep just fine every night. And when I wake up in the mornin' and look in the mirror, I know I'm the shit. I got hella money in my pocket and more men callin' me to put some more in it. So fuck you, Phoenix, and the high horse you rode in on. - You know what? I ain't scared of you. - So what? You don't need to be. - What I told you about using that type of language in my house? - Sorry, Grandma. - Phoenix, what happened? - Nothing, it's okay, Grandma, just give me the number, I'll give him a call. - Are you busy or do you have time for this interview? - Oh, oh my bad, what's good, brah? My name's Phoenix. - Marcus Ram. Come on in my office. In the future, if you ever get another interview with a prospective employer, never refer to him as "brah," and never chew gum. - Oh. I'm sorry. This is my first job interview. I guess I'm kind of nervous. - That's understandable. So does that mean you have no previous job experience whatsoever? - Oh, yeah, I used to, you know, charge girls to braid they hair all the time. But I guess that's... - So do you know Excel? - [Phoenix] Ex-who? - The computer program, Excel. Never mind. Do you have any computer experience? - Oh, yeah, I'm online all the time. Twitter, Facebook, Skype, I do it all. (laughs) - Can you answer phones and make coffee? - Oh yeah for sho' I can do that all day, too. I can't make coffee though, but I can run down to Starbucks and get you some. - Did you really just say "for sho' I can do that all day"? - Okay, sir, look. I know I'm coming off a little immature, and maybe a little inexperienced, but I promise you I'm a hard worker, and whatever you need me to learn, I can pick it up really quick. I just really want a opportunity to learn something from such a professional, handsome, well-groomed fella like yourself. - Well thank you, but I'm very aware of your potential, you don't have to sell it so hard. Listen, if you want the job, just come in Monday at 8 a.m. - That's kinda early, but okay. I can do it. I'll be there. Um, can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Uh, what kind of business is this anyway? - I am the owner and CEO of Modern Marketing Solutions. I advise and create marketing materials for high-end tech companies. Anything from brochures, training DVDs, commercials. With all that said, Phoenix, when you come into work on Monday, I expect your dress and your speech to exude professionalism. Here, fill out these forms and bring them back to me on Monday at 8 a.m. - [Phoenix] Oh my God, thank you so much, Mr. Ram I promise I will not let you down. I'm gonna be the best receptionist you have ever had. - We'll see, we'll see. - Eight o'clock. Take care. (pop R&B music) - Where you goin', P.? - [Phoenix] Off to go get my hair did at this shop in the hunnys. This your car? Give me a ride. - Now this is a lot car. Stole this G-thang like three weeks ago. Me, I be just smashin' it. - Ooh, uh-uh, never mind. I'm better off on the bus. - Why you gettin' your hair done anyway? You goin' out this weekend? You's crankin' or somethin'? - No, I got this new job and I'm tryin' to look professional, you know. - Ah, I just seen you on that video online on World Star, thought you was gonna be the next video vixen. 'Sup with that? - You did? How was hair, did you like my outfit? How many times did you see me? Was I looking fly? Tell me, tell me, tell me. - Hella conceited. - [Phoenix] Dante. - My name Tay. - Boy, please. I'm the one who gave you that name in the fifth grade, when we said we was gonna be rappers. So don't play with me like that, Dante. It is nice to see myself in a picture, in some videos and then maybe a magazine and some movies. - Slow down, Beyonce. - Quit hatin', anything's possible. - [Dante] That's true. But, I'm about to dip. - Okay. - See you girl. - Dante. Now you know you ain't got no business ridin' around in this car with those dummy friends of yours. You already got one case, is you tryin' to catch another one? - Don't worry about me, supermodel. I'm good. - [Phoenix] There really were no words that needed to be said. I mean, I ain't that old, but I know when a man is feeling me, right? It's all in the way that he looks at you, and look at me, can you blame the brother? - Girl, don't step on the stage and do too much, okay? - [Eileen] Didn't I say she was a mess? - I see. - Don't be mad 'cause I'm a five-star checkin' y'all self. - I'm gonna bust you upside the head if you keep talkin'. Keep it to your own, girl, you cute. You got that little model shape. If I was your age I would model. You know, I thought you said you had direction. No one can work on modelling on the side. - Mm-mm. I tried that modelling thing. I'm cool. - Oh, quit tellin' stories in my shop. That's right, what you did was appear in a little local video, you took a couple of picture with a shady photographer, you saw the ugly side and then you quit. If you're talkin' about really modelling, like gettin' a portfolio together. A resume. Gettin' your face out there. I mean, the world is bigger than the Bay Area, boo. Now that you got yourself a little job you can get the stuff you need, stack up your chips on the side. You know I got stuff in the shop you can borrow all day, shoes and purse for yourself. - So if I do decide to take this modelling thang seriously, does that mean you can be my own personal hair stylist? And you know I'm gonna need you to do my makeup, too. - If I see you really takin' it seriously, you not just on Facebook tryin' to be one of these little bathroom in the mirror picture modelling, then we can talk. - [Phoenix] Oh no she didn't! (laughs) - Oh yes, she did. - I'll get started on a new logo, I'll send you a rough draft, you can give your input and we can go from there. - Cool, cool, now you know this is the Raider nation, man, so it's got to be intimidating. - [Marcus] I know, I got you. I got you. - Marcus Ram. - [Marcus] Good to meet you, brother, good to see you. Take care. Phoenix. Aren't you supposed to be off by now? - Yeah, I know, but I really needed to ask you something. - What's up? - Well, I know I've only been working here for two weeks, but I really need the day off. - When? - Wednesday. - Today is only Monday. - I know, but there's this photographer in LA and he really wants to work with me, and he's really, really good, and I think this would be great for my modelling career. It's only one day, and I would really appreciate it if you can give me the day off. - Phoenix, I think we need to have a talk. Have a seat over there. First of all, as your employer, I'm very disappointed in the tone of this conversation. I mean, the way you ask for a day off, touchin' on my face? - Oh my God, I'm sorry, I just... I just thought that well, you know. - No, I don't know. - I thought that you liked me. - Listen, if I said or done anything to lead you on, I apologize. - [Phoenix] But, you gave me this job and I know I'm smart, but come on, me and you both know I'm under-qualified. And what about the way that you look at me? - How do I look at you? - Like how most men look at me. With desire in their eyes. - [Marcus] That's not the look that I'm giving you. - Well what kind of look is it then? - It's just a trip seeing you all grown up. - Huh? - Your grandmother. She used to babysit me when I was younger, and at the time you were a little baby. I used to help her feed you and change your diapers. - Yeah, well, I didn't know that. I just feel so stupid. Ugh, I just, I just feel so stupid. - Look, don't feel stupid. Just know that just because a man looks at you and shows you some attention, doesn't mean that he desires you. And it doesn't give you the license to try to play him based on that. Oh yeah, don't think I didn't peek in. - Hold on, I'm not tryin' to play you. I just wanted the day off. - Well go ahead, take the day off. Good luck with the photographer, and if modelling is the career that you choose to take, just let me know if you need anything I can do to help. - Thank you, Marcus. I will take you up on that offer. Did you used to know my mom? - Yes, I did. She was a beautiful person, inside and out. You remind me of her a lot. - Wow. Thank you. That, that really means a lot to me. Thanks for everything, I'll see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - [Dante] What's wrong with you? Your granny finally told you you're retarded? (laughs) - Heh heh heh heh. I'm not in the mood. - What's wrong? You trippin'. - Well, I got this photo shoot lined up with this photographer, and I thought my granny was gonna let me borrow the money for my flight, but she's talkin' about she don't got it and I called all my little boy toys, and asked them for it, but they acting like I gotta give them something in return for it. - Well, why you askin' people for money, anyway? Don't you got a job? - Well I spent my little pay check on outfits for the photoshoot. - If that's the case, how much is the tickets? - Well, I just checked online and roundtrip gonna hit me for like 150. I don't got that kind of money. - Take it. - Oh my God, Dante, thank you so much! I promise, as soon as I get my paycheck next week I'm 'a pay you back. - I want my money back, too. I'm not one of them sucker tricks you be dealin' with. - I promise, Dante, as soon as I get my paycheck next week I'll pay you back. - Mm-hm. - What you doin' with all this money anyway? - Shh. That's my 60 stash. - Your what? - I'm stackin' me some loot on the side so I can throw some 26s on the wheel. (laughs) Gonna be standing out here and you put me in the truck. - Oh, boy, you know you don't need no big old rims. - No, we all can't be on the cover of magazines, supermodel. (laughs) Some of us gotta shine a different way, you feel me? - Well, I'm 'a go in the house and purchase the tickets for my flight. Thanks again, Dante. (plane soaring) - I know all the editors for the hottest urban magazines. I play it smooth, I love your look. So what we're gonna do today is some glamour shots. I got this killer dress from LA's top designer. - Oh, that's what's up. I've always loved high fashion, so what else are we doing? - I figure we go to the Santa Monica pier, you know, get you in the beach, swim suit, do some nudes, then we head back here. - Hold on, did you say nudes? I ain't gettin' undressed for you, I don't even know you. You know what? Oh, hell no. You must have me confused with somebody's stripper or whore but I ain't either one, okay? - Hold on, baby, this the big time. This is LA. Now if you're really serious about being a professional model, you can't be self-conscious about your body, baby. Plus you ain't got nothin' to you I ain't see before. - You know what? I ain't nowhere near self-conscious about my body. Like I said, I don't know you and I don't trust you well enough to be having naked pictures of me! - [Woman] Work hard and success will come in due time - [Both women] These are my wings and with those I will rise - Oh my god! You look so good! How've you been! Angel! - What are you doing here? - I know! - How's your grandma, your cousins? - So cool, oh they good. Yo I was just out here tryin' to get my little modelling career started and stuff, and this so-called photographer had me come up in here and take some pictures, but anyway, that doesn't matter. What are you doing here? Do you live out here now? - Girl, yes. Me and my mom lived out here ever since we left Oakland. - Really? - Well since you two guys know each other, let's turn the game up a little bit. Let's do something to get both of you guys noticed. Matter of fact, I call my body paint guy, get a couple bottles of Moscato, and really get a party. - Mm-hm. I see you're still tryin' to get girls out to the pier to get 'em naked huh, Trevor? - Wait, Trevor? I though his name was TR. - Girl, if you was tryin' to impress hot models, would you tell 'em your name was Trevor? (laughs) I don't think so. - I probably wouldn't. - Ha ha, I'm glad to be a source of amusement for you two, but I'm a professional that's been published worldwide. You two ain't nothin' but a bunch 'a wannabes. Get out my studio, I got real models to work with. - Oh somebody's butt hurt. - TR, come on, don't be like that. Don't I make sure you got a VIP table every time we go to the club? - Yeah. - Okay, and didn't I hook you up with them three blond chicks the other night? - Yeah, you did. - Okay, alright, so just make sure that you know that this is my best friend, Phoenix, okay? She's off limits. - Anything for you, baby. But what brings you by? - Actually I just came to get some pictures from that music awards after party. - Okay. - So can you run and get those for me real quick? I'm gonna go catch up with my girl. - Okay. - Deuces. - Deuces, Trevor. (Angel laughs) Man, I missed you so much when you left. - Girl, me too. I cried myself to sleep every night after we left Oakland. We stayed in some safe house for a couple months and then we transferred to some housing out in Fresno, and I went to that old high school, graduated, and then moved here to LA. - Woah, I'm surprised you ain't at Cal Berkeley or Stanford or something. You were always so smart. - Thanks, yeah I got accepted into a bunch of colleges, but you know my mom's just workin' at Denny's at the time, so we couldn't afford all that. My dad wanted to help, but you know I still hate that dude. I just been bartending and waiting tables, working at a club part time, I just been really trying to work on my "modelling" career. I tried to go to these agencies to talk to them about runway modelling, and they tell me, oh, you're too thick, or you're too ethnic looking. So, I just been trying to like urban print work and maybe a few music videos, but don't get it twisted. 'Cause I'm not tryin' to be no Karen Stephans part two video vixen, you know, chick, and all that. - You don't even have to explain yourself. I already know what you talkin' about. Man, I can't wait to tell you what my cousins and them tried to have me do, ugh. But it sounds like me and you are trying to do the same thing. But they ain't gonna play us like we's some suckas, 'cause me and you together, man we could have this industry on lock, believe that. - Yeah, sounds good. But, I mean, the odds really aren't in our favor. Okay, we don't got a manager, we're not with an agent, we're literally at the bottom of the totem pole. - Well, if we're at the bottom, then we just need to do what we've always planned to do. Rise. - [Voiceover] Angel wanted to devote all her time to our dream, so she decided to move back to Oakland and we didn't waste any time putting our team together. Marcus and Eileen were true to their word. We came together and formed It Factor Models. - [Woman] Hey ladies, you must be Angel and Phoenix from It Factor. You look so much better than your pictures. I think so, I remember what sizes you guys wear, so I hand-picked a few things for you, and I wanna get you two into the first scene of the day. - I like her already. - Action. * Girl, you got it, you got it * Don't ever let them take it * You the baddest and I'm watchin * I see I gotta be patient * I need it and I want it - I need more energy, ladies. Give me a little bit more energy. * Give it to me * Just do it like the songs says * Give it to me, give, give it to me (Man giving directives) * Do it like the song says * Give it to me, give, give it to me * Do it like the songs says * Give it to me, give, give it to me * Do it like the songs say * Give it to me, give, give it to me * Do it like the song say * She gotta be at least a nine for me to f- with her * She get the job done so you know she go to work * Mommy's so bad, she know that we don't - Yeah, that's nice, so like, TI, like you're the greatest rapper of all time. * I'm losing my mind, she got me goin' berserk - Yeah keep goin', keep goin'. * See I'm known to flirt * First to have class, but I'm not a nerd * Shrimp said it, boys, so you gotta do it first - [Man] Let's cut, let's cut that, nice. Good job, good job. Action. That's nice. * Girl, you got it, you got it, * Don't ever let 'em take it * You the baddest and I want you - Keep goin, keep goin', keep goin'. * I see I gotta be patient - Dance, don't stop, we're making a video here. * I need it and I want it, give it to me not the wrong way * Just do it like the song say * Give it to me, give, give it to me - I like the girl from the first shot. She is beautiful, who is that? - That's Phoenix. * Give it to me, give, give it to me * Do it like the song say - Yeah, yeah. Keep doin' your thang, girl. * Do it like the song say * She gotta be at least nine for me to f- with her * She get the job done so you know she go to work - You know what, y'all two are not workin'. Move, move, hurry up. Get that, get that, beat it girls. * Losin' my mind, got be goin' berserk * This shirt's sticky, baby, see I'm known to flirt (girls laughing) - Hey, hey, hey, how all you doin'. That was a killin' over there. Y'all want some of this? - [Angel] Oh, no, no thank you we don't drink while we're working. - Hey, how you doin'? You look like you could be my next baby momma. - Oh, get in there, girls. - Better make off the other way. - Excuse you? - And I should beat your ass right now for stepping on my toes. - Oh, no, I'm about to beat the tracks of this one. You don't know me. - No, no, no, no. We're here on business. This is not the club. - And this hottie over here better get out my way before she catches this ass-whooping. - [Phoenix] What did you... - Oh did she just put her hands on me? - [Phoenix] Yes, she did put her hands on you. (girls shouting and arguing) - [Woman] Keep it movin'. (girls murmuring) - Oh what! Nice shoes. - Oh, okay. - Hold up, hold up, I'm not tryin' to harass you but, uh... - I ain't tryin' to harass you. I just love messin' with drunks. (laughs) - That's cute, but, uh, I liked how you handled that situation back there, too. - Thank you. - Uh, you don't work for that director, so who are you? - Eileen. Eileen Fonteneaux, It Factor Models. - Yeah, that's good. In fact, wait, wait. I got a boy Marcus that's been pumpin' up It Factor for the last couple weeks. - Mm-hm, that's Marcus Ram, he's my business partner. And you just met our two young starlets, Phoenix and Angel. - Yeah, they got attitudes. Nix that, I don't like that. But they cute, okay. But you cute, girl what you... - How can I help you? - Oh, well, uh, It Factor, yeah I see them being like next it girls, you get it like It Factor, we put it all together. Put it in a pot, stir it up, I mean we could do that. (laughs) - I know you're a really nice guy and all, but we're a serious agency and I ain't got time for all this, man, so... - Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, I'm sorry. Look look, I'm Lloyd Loyal. You know I'm probably not making a good first impression at you, but take my card, see I'm Lloyd Loyal with a... Loyal Publicity. Okay. 323 get seen. You like that? That's catchy, huh? I came up with that. - Alright, well, I can put a private investigator on retainer, so I'm a check you out. - Check me out, okay? - Okay. - Alright. Thank you. - Nice to meet you. - Alright. - Don't worry. - Checkin' you out right now, girl. (laughs) Yeah. How y'all doin', do I know you? - Girl, I almost gave that girl a country ass-whoopin'. I almost pulled my shoe off. (laughs) Overall we had a good day. I mean the director apparently liked y'all a whole bunch. So, it's a good start, y'all. - [Angel] That because of Phoenix's superstar performance! - No, no, no, I did have a little help. (girls laugh) - This is unacceptable. We agreed that you would pay me 200 dollars to help you shoot this video and now you handin' me 50 dollars? - Shana, Shana, look. The video went over budget, okay? I'm sorry. But I mean, on the real, what do you do anyway? - Well first of all, I casted the video, dealt with the label, damn near hand-picked the wardrobe, found the location, hired the crew, and all you did was show up and flirt with the models. - You know what, see that's another thing. I thought I made it real clear that in order to be a feature, the features had to be... Extra nice to the director. - It's not my fault you ain't got no game. - Look, keep your voice down, alright? - [Shana] What? - [Man] Be professional. - [Shana] You worried about someone finding out how shady you are, huh? Did you forget? I did the budget for the video, dummy. I know they paid you 7500 to shoot the video, and I only spent 4500, so where is the rest? - It's in my pocket, okay? Look, I'm tryin' help you get on. I'm tryin' to do you a favor. You ain't even actin' like you appreciatin' me. - Well you don't have to worry about helpin' me anymore. Lose my number, scumbag. I was wrong for that, I'll pray for you. Scumbag. (clapping) - [Phoenix] Girl give me a hug, that's right. Give him the lip, huh. - I apologize, I usually don't talk like that. - [Angel] Girl, you do not have to apologize, he deserved way worse than that. - You ain't lyin'. But you know what, this may be a blessin' in disguise. We just started our company, It Factor Models, we can use an over-achiever like yourself on the team. You may be a good fit. You should call us. - [Shana] Oh, thank you. One more closers, right? - [Eileen] That's right. - Talk to you guys soon. - [Eileen] Nice to meet you. Be a good look. Y'all ready? - [Voiceover] That's when things really started to take off. Eileen made sure Angel and I kept doing videos. Shana and I started to recruit other models. We would pick the girls, train them, and put them straight to work. I didn't think he could do it, but Lloyd pulled it off. His job was to spread the word about It Factor Models. I even went and found Cherry so she could have the opportunity to really get into the business and quit being influenced by my cousin. Our faces were really getting out there. We built great relationships with artists and directors. On top of that, we were making real good money. Then we got the news that we were flying out to New York to do a photoshoot with Essence for the cover of Kiss Magazine. - Mmm. French fries. You taste so good right now. But you're so bad for me. (knocking at the door) Nobody's here. - [Dante] Quit playin', it's me, D. - [Phoenix] Oh, what's good in the hood! I hope you brought me something to eat, 'cause you know, I'm starving. (laughs) - Nah. But I could slide down to Quick Way though if you want me to. - Mm-mm, okay. - But I thought models was supposed to watch they weight? - Mm, you right. I should put these greasy ass fries down. But they taste so good. - P, you, you drunk? (laughs) - Whatever. I think what happened was, me and Angel we went out for drinks with this really obnoxious director, right? Then we went to this bar and we got some more drinks, then some dudes, they bought us some more drinks so, yeah. I'm pretty wasted right now. (laughs) So what's up, brother? You stayin' out of trouble? - Yeah, you know me, I'm good. I was hopin' it on the black post with my peoples I seen you got dropped off, so I said, y'all lettin' my little celebrity find us, I don't get to see you no more. (laughs) - Well, you know I be on my little grind. Speaking of grinding, what is you doin' out there up on the spike? You know you ain't got no business out there. That's why you on probation now. One day you gonna learn, these streets ain't got no love for you. Like that. - One day, you gonna learn that this glitz and this glamour and all these cameras ain't got no love for you like that neither. (laughs) - Is that right? - Yeah. - You know, the more I learn about this game, the more I just feel so used, you know. Even though I'm in control and makin' money, and all that, it's just, it just feels so, so dirty. - Well you see, that's 'cause they only lookin' at what's on the surface. It's gonna take somebody that really know you to really appreciate what you got to offer. - [Phoenix] Is that right? - [Dante] Yeah. - Can you help me to my room, D? (giggles) - I love it when you wear your hair like that. - Boy, what is you talkin' about? - Your hair. You know I liked this in that Baller Boy video, and in that new model spread in the new XXL. - You paid attention to that? - I know it's kinda sad, but, uh, I pay attention to everything you do. Every video, every flyer, every magazine. I even bought that boozy jackhead ass Little Boss CD 'cause you was on the cover. - You know what Dante? I really don't want to sleep alone tonight. - P. You know how long I've been waiting to hear you say that? What about your granny, though. - Come on she won't be back until tomorrow. She took a trip to Reno. She ain't gonna be back. - I'm saying though, you drunk. I ain't tryin' to take advantage of you. - Boy, you is not takin' advantage of nobody. I know exactly what I'm doing. Come on. (dance music) - [Man] That's it, that's good, that's good, I love it, I love it. Give me the Charlie's Angels pose. There you go, that's it. Miss Essence, good job as usual. Here's some water for you. - Aren't you the best assistant ever? - You know I try to be, I try to be. - That was outstanding as usual, Essence. So I'm gonna see you and your man at the club tonight or what? - Maybe. We're talkin' about going out to Saint Crois, but I don't know, we'll see. It was a pleasure working with you as always. I will see you soon. - So, what's up with you? You're going on a date with the photographer? - Oh hell yes. He's one of the best in the country. It's always good to have one on your team. - Hey ladies, I just came by to say hi, and great job. So, I hear you girls are from my home town. - Oakland, California, born and raised. And we are such big fans of yours. - [Angel] She's not even lyin', we've seen every photo, every video you've ever been in... - Oh yeah, and we even watched every episode of that video reality show you was on. - Oh no, not that show. - [Voiceover] It's Timmy Tim's Search for his Gem, brought to you by menthol cigarettes, cognac, and blunt wraps. And here he is, swaggin' all day, Timmy Tim. - Now, ladies, y'all know Timmy Tim has had a taste of the finest ladies from Japan, to Amsterdam. Ain't that right, Big Rob? - That's right, my man Timmy Tim has some of the finest ladies all over the globe. - And why is that, Big Rob. - 'Cause you's a playa. - I'm a playa. And a what? - A boss. - I'm a boss. I've made my decision. The one who I've chosen to be my precious gem, to walk down that red carpet of life with me is... Essence. - After I gave it to you all that, god damn? After I gave it to you all that? No, I'm not leavin', I'm not goin'! - Hoo. Now then, Essence. Will you wear this ring and stand by my side and be the envy of all haters swaggin' around this world? Help me get this, baby. - I will, Timmy Tim! (applause) I look back on that and I cannot believe that I was kissin' on that old ass geriatric rapper. But you know what? It sure did open up some doors for me. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure, baby. - Um, is your name Aisha Stevens? - How you know my real name? - Well, I'm not no stalker or anything like that, but my grandma says she used to babysit you. - And who's your grandma? - Miss Griffin. - Momma Griffin is your grandma? - That's her granny. - Girl, come over here, give me a hug! We may as well be family! (laughter) Let me tell you a little something about your old grandma. I used to think I was so cute. (laughs) And your grandma would bring out that big old Polaroid camera, and I would just pose and smile. And then I would trot up and down the kitchen like it was my own personal runway. Your grandma was the best at finding out what a child was good at and pushing them. Man I loved that woman. Now let me ask you two a question. Why are y'all doing this? - Well, I guess besides the money it's for the fame and attention. - [Angel] Mm, access to the finer things in life. That status, maybe a rich husband and a mansion, a yacht and a clothing line and maybe a perfume named after myself? Hmm? (Essence laughs) Sorry I got caught up in the fantasy. - Well, let me tell you a little somethin' about my life. I've been in the game for what, nine, 10 years now? And I'm struggling to pay rent on my beautiful overpriced condo in Malibu. You would think that with my resume I can go onto any video set and be a feature, but half of the directors won't work with me because I won't sleep with them, and then the other half are mad because I'm still not sleeping with them. - But you've dated so many famous men. - I dated rappers, label CEOs, men that make 20 million dollars a year just to play a game. They offered me money just to be on they arm. They offered to take me on trips and on shopping sprees, but in the end all they see is this face, this chest, and this beautifully sculptured ass. (phone ringing) Girl are you gonna get that? - Oh that's just my boyfriend, he'll call back. - Let me see your phone. Hello? Oh, she stepped out for a moment. With some six-foot-eight-lookin' brother. (laughs) I think he name was Lebron or somethin' like that. Oh, I'm bad, girl. I'll be sure to tell her that you called. Bye bye now. (laughter) - Oh my God he is wanna kill me next time I see him! - Girl, you can't keep no boyfriend in this game neither. They wanna get all jealous and insecure and they figure they can't turn no video ho into a housewife. And you can forget tryin' to keep your female friends around. They get jealous, just because they don't get as much attention as you do, or they gonna turn around and call you all stuck up. - Mm. - Why are we doing this again? - Mm, mm. - That's the question that I aksed you. If I knew then what I know now, I would've stayed my black ass in school, married me a nice church boy, and had myself plenty of babies. All this, beauty fades. What is what you do with this, that lasts forever. Anyway, I have to go now. We told the paparazzi that we were meeting them at Mr. Chow's at around 8 p.m., so give your grandma my best, and tell her, next time I'm in town I will stop by and visit her. And I will see you ladies on the red carpet. Bye. - [Girls] Bye. - I guess all that glitter ain't gold. - Mm-hm. Well you heard what she said, we just need to step our game up. (phone rings) - Hey baby. (laughs) No, I'm not back in town yet. Yes, I'll hit yoiu up when I get I get back and we'll kick it, for sure. I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye bye. - So who's that? Your little director friend? - Oh, no that was Boss Beat. He is so sprung off you girl. - Oh hell no. What the hell is you doin' hangin' with Boss Beat? Do you know what type of guy he is? - [Angel] Girl, the dude got money and power. And he don't mind sharin' it with your girl. But wait, you should see the way people look at us when we go out to the club, you cannot pay for that type of publicity. Mm-mm. - You know what? I kept my mouth shut for too long. Angel, you're doing too much. You're just gonna make a bad name for yourself and we don't need that. - We? Who is we? We're not little anymore, okay Phoenix? I do what I do and it ain't none or your business who I do it with. Are you just mad 'cause your man ain't a even a factor? Or is because I'm gettin' more shine than you? (laughs) - Now let me tell you somethin'. Ain't nobody jealous of you. I'm just worried you're gonna try to sleep your way to the top everywhere we go. - Well you don't got to worry about me, okay? I've been takin' care of myself ever since me and my momma left Oakland, and I've been doing just fine. So you ain't got to worry about Angel. (pop R&B music) - Naw, you just keep doin' what you doin'. (phone rings) - See? Right when I'm ready for round two. Your phone start goin' off like a high school bell. - Hey, Dante, that ain't cool. - Now who is Nathan? - Give me my phone. - So you keepin' secrets? So you hidin' stuff from me now? That's how we rockin'? - Oh my God, calm down. Ain't nobody keepin' secrets from you. And if you must know, Nathan is Essence' assistant, see? He just texted me her number and told me to give her a call. - Mm. Well, don't let me hold you up. Out of all these little "video vixens" that you be with, that's the only one who's really out here bustin' power moves. - Yeah, I know. That's why I'm thinkin' like, what does she wanna talk to me for? I mean, I know I'm doin' my thang, but I ain't nowhere near on her level. - You say she on her way out, right? So who's to say you're not gonna be her next successor? - Oh. I'm impressed. That's a big word. What books you been readin' lately? - Play on me if you wan to, but you need to go play with yourself and soak up some of this game. Man, call Essence. - Hello? - Hey, Nathan, this is Phoenix. - Phoenix, hey, how you doin'? - I was just callin' to speak to Essence? - Yeah, she's right here. One second. it's, uh, Phoenix. - Okay. - Hey, Phoenix. How's everything goin', boss lady? - I'm doin' fine. - Well I just wanted to give you the heads up that I'm 'a be down in your area. i'm going to San Francisco to shoot a infomercial and I was hoping that you can come down, hang out and have a cocktail. - Really? Yeah, sure. I wasn't doin' nothin' but hang out with my boyfriend. - Uh... Well, you can bring him. What I'll do is I'll have Nathan, my assisstant, text you the address and I'll see you around 11 a.m. tomorrow. - Okay, I'll tell him. Alright, bye. - Alright then girl. Bye bye. - This is the one for you. - This is the one for me. But all y'all out there remember, it's not magic, it's Madrid. - [Man] Cut, you, guys take ten. - I wanted to say thank you for being part of this video today. - Well thank you, and it really does help, that's good. Thank you for your time, you look fly. Hey, momma! - [Phoenix] Hi! How you doin'? - I'm good. Thank you. - [Nathan] Look at you, it's lookin' like you gonna have your own line of hair products one day. - I know, I can see it now. Wigs, by Essence. - Actually, Madrid and I already have a deal in the works. - Oh, okay. - Yes. - I want you to meet my boyfriend, Dante. - Hi, Dante, it's lovely to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Essence. - Well Dante, I hope you're not still mad at me for having a little bit of fun with you on the phone that day. (laughs) - Naw, that's good. I was ready to get on a flight and come see somebody about my female. - Oh, please don't. (laughs) - Essence, you did a great job. - Thank you, it was lovely workin' with you. - Who's your friend? - Oh. - I'm sayin', you really feel you can just get at me like you don't see me standin' right here? - No, I didn't mean it like that, man. - [Dante] Then what you mean? Come on, man. I oughta break your jaw. I know what you're doin', man. - [Nathan] Hey, he just want what you got, that's all it is. - Okay, just y'all go. - [Dante] Okay, alright. - [Nathan] Okay, let's go get a drink. - God, girl. - Essence, I am so sorry, I did not know that he was gonna-- - You know what? I don't even wanna hear it. I already know what's goin' on. You two grew up on the block, and you two are just so in love, right? - Yeah. Wait, I mean, how could you tell? - I had one of those just like that. And his name was Jay and I loved his dirty drawers. But I had to let him go as soon as he started to mess with my money. This fool had the nerve to get into a fight with the artist just because he felt like the dude was holdin' me a little too tight. You know, some men just can't handle their women being in the center of attention. You know what I'm sayin', ma? - Yes, I do get what you're saying. - [Voiceover] Essence took me under her wing and introduced me to her industry insider friends as the new "it" girl. (dance music) My only competition was Angel, and she continued to step her game up. The business was doing real well despite the fact that me and Angel weren't talkin, but you could feel the tension. - Girl, they just like credit cards. Except for they Visa gift cards. Shoot you could use 'em anywhere they take a credit card at, and that's real talk, I'm serious. - How many did you get? - Now don't worry about all that, just know that I got all day. - [Eileen] I'll spread the word. - Mm-hm. - But you know I gotta get something out of it. - Now girl you know I got you, you know how we get down. - Just wanted to make sure. - Ooh, uh-uh. Here comes the diva. - Boo. - Let me get up out of here before I catch a case. - The only thing you gonna catch around here is a ass-whoopin'. - Is that right? - You can go run and tell your little cousin that, too. She can come get some if she wants it. - You know what? Hold this for me. - [Eileen] Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. - Hell no, you ain't gonna thing you're talkin'. - No, uh-uh, uh-uh. Call you tomorrow. - Yeah, you lucky. - Girl what's your problem? Since you got back from New York you've been trippin' hard. I don't know what the problem is between you and Phoenix, but y'all better figure it out, it's bad for business. - Yeah, it's Phoenix. She's really on one. She's jealous. She's mad 'cause I'm gettin' more work than her, okay? She's messin' with some lane from the block and I'm messin' with bosses. She can't stand it. And then she had the nerve to tell me the other day that I was doin' too much because she found out I was kickin' it with Boss Beat. - Oh really. - Yeah. It's like, you trippin'. - I've known Boss Beat for some years and if you've been movin' like that, somebody should pull you to the side. - Now you sound like a hater. - Now you wait a minute. You had your little turn to speak and now it's mine. Now I already heard plenty of rumors about you sleepin' with rappers and directors, and here I am defendin' you, telling folks that you not that type of girl. - I don't believe you. - Tamika. - Huh. - [Eileen] What you hear about Angel? - I heard that you did a sex tape with three of the Baller Boys, baby. - Wow. I only let one them take me to dinner. - It ain't about what the truth is, it's about what people believe. And keepin' company with Boss Beat is not going to improve your image. They might be paradin' around, chillin' with you, but I bet he's tellin' his people that you looser than drunk hoozie and easier than a fresh pie. Don't you know men lie and gossip worse than women? - That's the truth. - The bottom line is it reflects badly on the agency. But even more so, you know, Phoenix looks at you like you her sister, she'd never hatin' on you. - I know. - [Eileen] What'd you say? - I know she wouldn't do that. I was just mad that she thought that I was gettin' down like that. - About time you got over it and got back to business. - Hey, ladies, I got some good news. - [Eileen] Came to get permed? - No. - [Lloyd] Hah, that's funny. - Go ahead, go ahead. - Look man, we came 'cause we have some good news. We want to let y'all know in person right? Here you go, why don't you read this. Go ahead, girl. - [Angel] Now why you so quiet? Let me see that. Is this for real? - You know, it's probably gonna come with money, girl. Tell your sister the good news. - Thanks, guys. - Alright. - Psh, please. She can't whoop me. Girl, you is not gonna believe this. Why is she walkin' up to the house right now? No, you ain't gotta come here, I got this. Alright, bye. - So I hear you're gonna whoop my ass, huh? - [Angel] Wow, your cousin talks too much. - Oh so you're not denying it. Well, run up then. - Hey, don't let the light skin fool you. - Oh, well don't let this pretty girl swag fool you, because I will still give you a deep East Oakland ass-whoopin'. - Hey, I wasn't in Fresno for that long. It's still deep East on mine. (laughs) - Oh my God. I'm the one who talk you that. How you gonna use it on me? - I know, and it works every time. - Man. So did you really say you was gonna whoop my ass? - I've been sayin' a lot of dumb things lately. And you know Phoenix, I'm sorry. - It's cool, I ain't trippin'. But you know I'm just tryin' to look out for you, right? - I know, but it just really hurt me that you though that I was sleepin' with all these dudes. - [Phoenix] I mean, well what else was I supposed to think? Every time I look up, you're talking to a different photographer, or rapper, or singer, or label executive, or dope dealer or... - I get the point, P. - [Phoenix] Sorry. So really, girl, what's goin' on with you? - You know, when I started going to school in Fresno I was labelled the new girl, and all the girls wanted to talk shit and pick on the new light-skinned girl, and all the boys gave me the wrong kind of attention for the same reason. And you know how I made it through all that? - How? - I would go into every situation and think to myself, what would Phoenix do? You know? If a group of girls tried to test me, I would just act like you. And if a boy ran past me and grabbed my booty, I would chase him and beat him down. (laughs) - Like I used to do with Dante? (both laughing) - Exactly. And after a while I got the reputation of being the tough mixed chick from Oakland, and all the boys would kiss my ass 'cause they knew I was no punk. And then when the girls blossomed they really did everything I said. And when I moved to LA I took that same attitude and drew all my strength and determination and toughness from thoughts of you. You may not know it, but you brought me though some of the toughest times in my life. And you weren't even there. I mean like, I guess you can just say that tough girl came out when I thought you were attacking me. - No, I wasn't tying to attack you, it's just that I don't want no one thinkin' that we get the opportunities that we do 'cause 'a any funny business, you know? - Now you know my mother's story. She's been used and abused by men all her life. Now I told myself that would never be me. And I may let these guys take me out and buy me things and show me off, but they get no nana. I'm serious, I'm really stingy with the goodies and if anyone's running around here tryin' to say they hit it, they're lying. I guess you can say I try to play guys before they get a chance to play me. Because I refuse to let any man hurt me again. - Yeah, I... I'm sorry. You know what, come here girl, give me a hug. I, I just want you to know, Angel, that you don't have to do all of that. Your quality of your work is good enough. It just makes us all look suspect. - I know that now. Eileen, she really broke it down to me when we were talking earlier. Eh, speaking of business, read this. - What's this? What? Does this say that Essence wants to sign with It Factor Models? Is this real? - Girl, this is more than real. It's already happening. Marcus and Lloyd flew down to LA to get the paperwork finalized today. And we're gonna have a party to celebrate next weekend. - Wow, we have one of the most iconic models in the the game working for our agency! - Yes. - This is, this is... - This is what happens when two girls from the hood dare to rise. - Oh my God, Angel, stop. I'm just tryin' to soak all this in. - We don't got time for all that, girl. We got to go get outfits for the party! - Ah! Come on, let's go. I knew this was gonna happen. (dance music) - Eileen says she's gonna do your hair and your makeup at the club, so hurry up. - Okay, I'm fine, I'm just determined to find these pumps. (phone ringing) - Hey Sasha, are you okay? Is Granny cool? - Girl, Phoenix, Granny is fine. I was just callin' to make sure me and Tammy was on the guest list for tonight. - Look, Sasha, I'm just gonna keep it real to you, I don't think you should come to the party. It's gonna be a lot of models and photographers and people I wanna work with there. - Little cousin. I know you not sayin' what I think you sayin'. - Sasha, come on, it is not like that. You wouldn't even have fun anyway, it's not that type of party. - Naw, cuz', just keep it real. You ashamed of me 'cause I'm a escort and a stripper and you think you too good for me to be at the party with people you do business with. Just say it. - What? Maybe some things are better left unsaid. - Oh, okay. It's good. - Bye. - Oh yeah, it's good. Come on, girl. - Hey what's up, how you doin'? - Hey, what's up with you, girl? How you doin', what's your name? - I'm good. Alindsa Rishan. - Oh my name's Swagg, where you from? - Hey, what up, Swagg? - I'm gonna catch you later. - It's all good. Hey, what's up with you, girl? - Hey little momma, you ready to get some of that money, holla at your girl. - Hey Tammy what's up with you girl? When you gonna be ready for some of this swag daddy? - The only thing I'm ready for is the money. Let's talk about that. (laughs) - Hey, Dante, let me get one. - Thank you. Mmm. Dang, boy, you looking good. You must be goin' to that party tonight, huh? - Nah. I ain't trippin' off that punk-ass party. - Yeah, your girlfriend act like she ashamed of me, don't want me to come to the party. Like I'm too hood for her new friends. (laughs) - Is that right? - What's so funny? - I mean, you are hella ghetto. And grimey, and ratched. And some of everything else. So... - Like that? - [Dante] Come on Sasha. Don't be like that. I've known you my whole life. Hell, I know how you came up. And I ain't mad at you. But you know Phoenix be around them squares. - Well if I'm too ghetto, what you think that makes you? Boy, you ain't nothin' but a street dude and you been to jail way more times than I could count. So if I'm too ghetto to go to the party, what you think they think of you? (laugh) Better yet, how long you think Phoenix gonna keep you around once she meets Essence's ballin' ass friends? (laughter) You better be lucky you got something while you could. We all know Phoenix way out your league. - Now you trippin'. Phoenix lucky to be with a young boss like myself. Ain't that right, Swag? - [Swag] Yeah, bro, you already know that's right, bro, but you know what I'm sayin', you know I'm your partner, right? Now you know, but your girl Phoenix, she's bad, bro. I seen her in her video with Young Sticky the other day, on my phone, you feel me? You know what I'm saying? But hey, no disrespect. I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin' she bad. - She ain't that fine. Only reason why dudes be on her is because she be in videos and magazines. She ain't nothin' but a ho. - I know you ain't talkin' 'bout hoes. You will wanna be easy, Tammy. 'Cause you been about. - You can say whatever you wanna say about me, but I saw your girl at the Marriott with some rapper the other night. I was at the bar and she was on her way with dude hugged up all the way to the penthouse suite. - Man, brah, you know it ain't solid you know that ain't true, brah. You know that ain't true, brah, you know your girl. - Swagg, brah, you hand me that bottle? Think I'm'a slide, I'll be back. Don't do nothin' crazy. - Hey, before you go. Look, you know Phoenix is just young, sprung, and tryin' to be seen. But when you get ready for some of these grown woman goodies, holla at your girl. (laughs) Woohoo. So, um, did you really see Phoenix at the Marriott? - Girl, no, I was just tryin' to make her dude mad. She messed up our party. - Huh. Dang. - [Shana] You guys are takin' way too long. - Okay, Shana, let me just go put this dress on and I'll be ready to go. - You know she's gonna take forever. Why don't you just go down there and we'll meet you there? - [Shana] Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure, I still gotta look for these pumps. - Okay, Phoenix, I will meet you two down there, but please, don't take too long. Hello Dante. Oh that's what happens when you an't got no home trainin'? - Babe, have you seen my red pumps? - Shoes. Don't ask me about no shoes, Phoenix. - What? - What's this I hear about you hugged up with some rapper down there at the Marriott? - Dante, what are you talking about? Are you drunk? - Eh. Just 'cause I'm not on TV and I'm not in these magazines, that don't mean I'm stupid, Phoenix. - Dante, baby, look at me. I don't know who you been talkin' to, but when I'm out working, that's what I do when I'm working. I'm not worried about being hugged up with nobody but you, okay? Now, I have to go to the party, so just chill. - No, not tonight. You ain't goin' nowhere. - Dante, stop, what are you, stop! Dante! Stop it, Dante get off of me! Dante, let me go! (screaming) - Dante what are you doing? Get away from her! What the hell, we've known each other all our lives! You know Phoenix isn't a cheater! Man. - Forget that! She probably picked them little hoish ways up from you. Everybody know Angel the number one little industry slut. - Phoenix, let's go. Get your stuff. We're leaving. (gun cocking) - This ain't none of your business. - Dante. - Go get your little punk ass up out of here. Phoenix, she ain't goin' nowhere. - No, Phoenix is my business, she's my sister. You know what, Dante? I never knew that you would turn out to be a drunk and a punk. I thought that you would turn out different than the rest of everybody else out here, but look at you. You ain't shit. You ain't never gonna be shit. (Phoenix gasping) (gunshot) (Phoenix screams) - [Phoenix] No! No, Angel, get up! Get up, Angel, no! No! Angel, no! Somebody! - [Man] We are gathered here today to lay to rest the earthly remains of Angel Bates, a beloved daughter and friend. Angel was a rising star in her chosen profession, and she truly did touch the hearts of each of us who were blessed to have her in our lives for just a brief moment. We say goodbye to Angel today, but not to her spirit. That will live on in every smile brought on by her memory and in the hearts of all who loved her, until we go to meet her in the next life. (crying) Amen. - I'm so sorry, I never meant for this to happen, please forgive me. - It's not your fault, baby. (crying) It's not your fault. It's not your fault. - Phoenix, you have to get up, baby. Do you want me to fix you something to eat? - No, I'm fine. (knocking) - I'll get it. Baby, do something with yourself, you look a mess. Phoenix, get up, baby, you have a visitor. - [Phoenix] Do I know you? - Hello, Phoenix, it's nice to finally meet you. I'm Laurence Bates, Angel's father. - [Grandma] I'll let you two talk. - I knew I'd seen you before. I remember you from the funeral. I, I'm sorry about what happened to Angel. - No. Don't apologize. What's done is done. And the one responsible is in jail. I don't know if she ever told you, but I was abusive to her mother. I have a drinking problem. That's no excuse, but Angel never forgave me. She didn't want nothin' to do with me. But I stayed in touch her mother. She told me about the agency, about the potential for growth and how she loved her best friend, Phoenix. Help me honor my daughter's legacy. - I mean no disrespect, Mr. Bates, but I feel like I lost both my best friends that night. I just don't want nothin' to do with the agency, it would just bring back too many memories. - Well then do somethin' else. My daughter had a dream to empower women, and I know you got the same dream. Phoenix, help me honor my daughter's legacy and carry on the work that you two were doing. I'll be here for you if you need me. Just call me. - Phoenix, it hurts me so much to see you in so much pain, but you have to move on from this. I know you wanna close your eyes, lay down, and pretend like nothing bad ever happened, but you have to find a reason to live. - I'm trying. But it's like I have all these questions running in my head, like what made Dante do that? - There's a reason for everything, and we can't question what God's plan is. Everyone from Angel to Dante, Eileen to Marcus, Shana, Lloyd and even Essence were put in your life for a reason. Sometimes these people are there to help us soar above adversity, their support allows us to rise us to heights we couldn't have reached on our own. You think about that. - [Voiceover] I opened the envelope and read it. Angel's father set up a trust fund for her to use when she turned 25. He transferred the trust fund to my name in the sum of 75,000 dollars. - That story is so moving. Are readers are really gonna be able to identify with you. So after you got the money, what did you do? - Well, I used the money to start We Rise Inc., and since then we've become one of the most successful agencies in the industry. We represent everyone from models, actresses, makeup artists, writers, graphic designers, you name it. Oh and Eileen has taken over as Essence's business manager, and in conjunction with Marcus Ram Enterprises and Loyal Publicity, they're producing a talk show for her, which should air on network TV next quarter. Oh, and Shana, she has become one of the most sought-after video directors of her time. And we also plan on opening Angel's House, a shelter for women and children who have been affected by domestic violence. - Phoenix, I want to thank you once again for granting us this interview. I'm sure our readers will find your story very inspiring. Do you have any parting words to share with the world? - No matter how bad or how hard the times, I will have faith in what's right in the power of my mind. Work hard and success will come in due time. These are my wings and with those I will rise. *Growing up I never had much * That didn't stop me from chasin' dreams * In my mind I always knew that I could fly * There will always been someone around to bring you down * When there's something in your way * Just focus and one day you'll find your wings * You must reach high and touch the sky * Stand tall, let the world know * That you can have it all * The only thing stopping you is you * Work hard and do what you got to do * It doesn't matter where I come from * Or what other people do to me * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise * It doesn't matter what I've been through * There are people who believe in me * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise * Some people gonna talk, some people gonna hate * Some people don't even like themselves * Misery needs company, too * We really wanna go, what you really wanna say * Trust and believe there's no limit * To what you can achieve * You must reach high and touch the sky * Stand tall let the world know that you * Can have it all * The only thing stopping you is you * Work hard and do what you got to do * It doesn't matter where I come from * Or what other people do to me * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise * It doesn't matter what I've been through * There are people who believe in me * Watch me rise, watch me rise, watch me rise - [Voiceover] As the phoenix rises form the ashes it is reborn. It flies high, brimming with new life. The phoenix emerges from the fire stronger than it was before. Much like the human spirit, the will of the pheonix is immortal and invincible. No matter how bad or how hard the times, I will have faith in what's right in the power of my mind. Work hard and success will come in due time. These are my wings and with those I will rise.
