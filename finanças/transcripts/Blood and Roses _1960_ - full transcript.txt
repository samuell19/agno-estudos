You are now flying aboard a Caravel. Our average speed is 800 km/h. We'll reach Rome; our next stop, after 95 minutes in the air. We'll fly at 11,000 meters high and will be offering you a meal during the flight. We hope you'll have a pleasant trip. - Why are you knocking on wood? - You never know. You Italians, "Che confusione" I thought you were a true materialistic person. "Material has its reasons which reason knows nothing of". I know you well, doctor. I bet you have a story to tell us. - Me? - Please, don't make us ask twice. Thank you. I do have one. A strange story. So strange that even today, I still doubt what I've seen. I'll only change the names of the persons involved. As some of them are still living and you could come across them tomorrow, or today. Most of the year, I'm working in one of the most secluded parts of the Roman countryside. It's a place that inspires daydreaming. And melancholy, as well. Martha! Martha, come back! Come back at once. There are vampires here! Come back! I didn't see them. I must have frightened them! Leopoldo of Karnstein! Here's your fiancee. I'm bringing her back to you. - You know, it's a miracle that I'm still alive. - What happened to you? I wasn't riding a horse but a ferocious beast! Who? Romeo?! He's calm as a sheep. Kiss me. Ah, Carmilla. We have a new drama in the kitchen. Go calm down Victoria. We have guests tonight. - ...Thy will be done... - I'd like to see the vampire. Just one time. ...on earth as in heaven. Give us our daily bread. And give flu to Martha. Make her be confined to bed for two weeks for having stupid ideas like this. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us. And make Marie break her leg tomorrow in the staircase. Bless us, Mary, full of grace, but not Martha, she's too nasty. Make her have such a huge pimple on her nose that she could never get married. Amen. The Count is expecting me. The engineer Ruggieri. - Ah, the man of the day! - Pleased to meet you, Count. The famous fireworks manufacturer. Judge Monteverdi from Venice's court - who is the father of my fiancee Georgia. - Good evening. - Dr Valeri. - How do you do? Guido Naldi, one of our neighbors. And Carmilla von Karstein. The last descendant of the Austrian - branch of our family. - Good evening. Here's my plan: I will give a big costume party for Georgia Monteverdi. At midnight, I want fireworks to be the star attraction. - So, something great. - The greatest you can do. To make successful fireworks, it involves geography, mathematics and theatre. I've spent my afternoon exploring the area. I've found the ideal geographic place. It's 450 m from here. You can see it from the village and the castle. On a clear hill there remains the ruins of a medieval abbey-church. So I have my place, my successive stages and an old tower I will Transform into a luminous fountain. Our specialty. - Are you confused, Lisa? - Oh, sorry. A cemetery is a nice setting for fireworks. I'm so sorry! It's awesome, Ruggieri. We'll blast the rockets from our ancestor's tombs! A cemetery... I'll need the dioceses authorization. No need, the graves have been empty for two centuries. - Is there any other problems? - No, no... Oh, yes, I'll need a few men - for the excavation work. - Giuseppe. - Giuseppe! - Giuseppe, we're speaking to you. - Ask some men in the village. - It won't be easy, Count. - Why? - They are afraid. - Afraid of my rockets? - Afraid of the Karnstein. Afraid of vampires! So you have some of these giant bats here? No, we're speaking about real vampires. - The Undead who drink the blood of the living. - Carmilla is right. When you open a Vampire's grave, his body is intact. A slight breathing raises his chest, a lukewarm blood is flowing in his veins He is identical to the living, except in his cruelty. I love dark tales. Carmilla loves them too. A bit too much. I'm lost. Fireworks, Karnstein family, vampires... What's the connection? My dear judge, don't you know that all Karnsteins are vampires? When you asked for my daughter's hand, you concealed this detail! Don't worry. We've ceased being vampires since 1775. - 1775? - That's absolutely correct, we kept the statements. This year, the peasants who were fed-up feeding the Karnstein invaded the cemetery, opened the graves, stuck wooden stakes in the Vampire's hearts and burned the bodies. A priest was there. Everything was done by the book. - They destroyed all of them? - No. There's one left. It's contested. She. Don't you think I look like her? I'm sure she looks like you. That's what must be done to win me. Tell us her story, Carmilla. She was called Millarca. She was a Karnstein from the heyday She means from the time we were vampires. She passionately loved her cousin Ludwig von Karnstein. She died before the wedding in Ludwig's arms, who swore her an everlasting love. And how did this charming vampire manage to escape the massacre? When the angry peasants arrived at the cemetery, Millarca's tomb was empty. Ludwig managed to save the body of his beloved one. And nobody ever found her'? No. She's still sleeping in the secret tomb her lover gave her. What happened to Ludwig? He was unfaithful. He had been engaged three times. And all three of his brides died. Millarca got revenge. The rose is faded. Flowers always fade in a vampire's hand. Would Millarca like me if she came back? She's coming back... She went through the olive tree woods... She half-opened the door. She kept her white dress. She's coming in. She's looking at unknown faces... without seeing them. She's looking for somebody. Suddenly, she stops in front of Leopoldo. Would Leopoldo not be alike Ludwig von Karnstein? - And you're here; Georgia, the bride. - She'll kill me like everybody else. Kill you? You're so sweet, so young, so confident. Tonight, she might come back for Leopoldo. Leopoldo is mine! - Weren't you afraid? - It's good to be afraid! - Where is Carmilla? ls she upset? - She's been living in this house since - she was thirteen. She grew up here, and suddenly... - And suddenly? Nothing. - She'll probably join us. - You really think so'? - Put yourself in her shoes. When Leopoldo has a child. The land... The land'? Carmilla is much richer than Leopoldo. 50,000 hectares in Austria, plus the family jewels... - Where is your Carmilla? - She doesn't like dancing. Don't you want to keep her company? She doesn't like my company. - Still not here? - No. What can I do? One day enthusiastic, the next one prostrate... The party fell on the bad day. Leopoldo! You've come to my party? How nice of you! I'm having the time of my life. I was just looking for a dance partner. You're drunk. I drank to the future spouses! You really look great. - Are you dancing, my lord? - You'll be whimsy another day. Tonight, I ask you to dress yourself and to come down. - I can't, I have a headache. - Take some aspirin. There's some on the dressing table. - Here it is. - I don't want to see anybody. You have ten minutes. I hear and obey. - Part six. - Part six ready. - Part seven. - Part seven ready. - Part eight. - Part eight... Shit! I've got no more power! It's ten to midnight. Everybody get ready. Miss, Count. On this solemn day... I come to wish you Miss, that the princess legends... That... the princesses... That... the legends... I'm sorry... Please meet my final guest of the hour, Millarca. In the old days, she use to devour the brides of the Karnstein. Tonight, she's only come to kiss me. Let's see what you can do Ruggieri. Leave me alone! - You really want to stay alone? - Yes. I'll tell you your future. In two weeks, bridesmaid. In one year, godmother of their first child. And in ten years, the nice auntie Carmilla. You're showing off. You don't want to admit it. You're in love with Leopoldo. You've always been. And it's killing you. Wait for me here. - Nobody's hurt? - No, no. "To my love, Millarca" Millarca. - Aunt Clara looked beautiful tonight. - But she kept her mask on the whole time! That's what I said. Are you as bitchy as the other girls? I'll never be bitchy with you. Who's the tall redhead girl the doctor stayed with all night? The daughter of one of our neighbors. I think the doctor has some kinky tendencies. Why?! Leopaldo! Look. Carmilla... Carmilla... She can't wake up. I'm not surprised, she was totally drunk. I'll take her to her room. How beautiful she is. She looks like a child when she's asleep. It's funny, I should be jealous. But for some reason, I can't be. Come. Let her sleep. Carmilla. - Your hands are frozen. - Yes, they are. - I feel very cold tonight. - But it's daytime already. It's daytime? - So? - I've told you sir, somebody hid explosives up there. During the retreat in 1944, the Germans buried several landmine stocks in this area. We didn't know about this one. One of the rockets must have caused the blast. What are you going to do? Call the army who'll send bomb experts. Landmines are not fireworks. They kill when they explode. - So what would will you do? - I'll bomb the whole place, with the regular cares, once and for all. Beautiful ruins like this... Ruggieri is right. They aren't worth the risk. The army will decide. Until then, I'll keep out of the entrance. "Danger! No trespassing" I've never seen you laugh like this, Carmilla. It's nice. What was so funny? - Just a foolish thing. - The Karnsteins are charming people, - but a bit disconcerting. - You think so? I never know what to think, here. - Where is Georgia? - In the park. A fox was trapped in the pheasantry, last night. - A fox? - Yes. - I want to see. Hello, miss. - What are you going to do? - Kill him. - Oh no! I want to domesticate him. - Foxes are nasty animals, Miss. This one was eating our pheasants every night. But that doesn't matter! Look at his eyes. He already likes me. Be nice, catch him for me. He's biting you. Give him to me. - Georgia! - Come here. We caught a fox. I can't even put the lead on him... Look... He's nasty... He could bite you... - Look at that. - He's so cute. You'll see if he's cute when he puts out one of your eyes! He doesn't want to go out... Here. Look how nice he is. - What's wrong with you? - I haven't run in a long time. Don't you like the sun? The sun is burning hot. I like to be burnt. Why are you pretending to be asleep? I'm not pretending. When I'm happy, I close my eyes. Hello, girls! I'm back from the abbey. No more mystery, that was German - ammunitions that exploded. - I'm sad, Leopoldo. We caught a fox but he escaped. How dreadful! We'll try to catch him. Giuseppe? - Yes, sir? - We need to catch a fox for Miss. Set a trap. - I want him alive.- Yes, Miss. -The same one! ...are unbearable. If the prince didn't abdicate in 1749... - 1759. - Excuse me? - He abdicated in 1759. - I don't think so. Try to recall, the year of cholera. I didn't know you were so accurate towards history. Play a record, Carmilla. Leopoldo is going to make us dance. Gosh, she's right! It was 1759, indeed. It's the first time I've been wrong about the Habsbourg. I'm going riding tomorrow. Do you want to come with me, - You're not afraid anymore? - I am, but I'm jealous of Carmilla. I just want to ride as good as her. Change the speed, you're on 78 rpm. What's that? You've played us crazy music!? - Can you make me dance? - With this? Come on, Leopoldo. Don't make me ask twice. But I don't know how. I can't. Dance, Leopoldo. This is an order! What am I doing here? Carmilla. Are you feeling well? Just a bit tired. Good night. - She's unpredictable. - You're tolerant. Perhaps she's tired. She's mostly capricious. A trap for a fox. Does he think it's easy? And on top that, for a specific fox! - Hey, it's Giuseppe! - "I'm a bit late! I'm expected at the castle!" - There's nothing funny! - The castle is the other way. I know. Giuseppe! The Count and Ms Georgia have been for a ride but they'll soon be back. Hey, Moby Dick. What's wrong with you? Easy, Moby Dick. Carmilla! Our honour is in jeopardy: like her father, she only believes what she can see. She says it's impossible to jump over the wall. He didn't even try it. Carmilla's the great horse rider of the family. She'll show you. - Go ahead. - No. - See? You liar! - Go ahead Carmilla, saddle on. - No. Not today. - Why? I don't want to ride. One more whim? - Is that a challenge? - No... Go ahead, Carmilla! For Christ's sake, leave her alone. Don't you see she can't. Carmilla! Carmilla! It was a stupid bet, I know you can jump over it. Did you see that? My horse was afraid of me. You know we didn't want to hurt you. And you, are you afraid of me? I'll never totally understand the Karnsteins. It was torn up, Ms. A beautiful dress like this. Should I maybe send it to the dressmaker? No, no. At what time do you finish your shift? When the table is cleared away. Where do you sleep? Ms already knows that: in the small guesthouse. You forgot the milk for Ms Carmilla. Soon she'll only feed herself with fresh water! She was so fond of good food before. If you don't keep quiet, I won't tell you what I saw in the park the other night. What was he doing in the park the other night? Sitting under Georgia's windows! Aren't you ashamed? Skin on Ms Carmilla's milk! What a big deal! When she saw that, she turned pale. I thought she was going to beat me. Strange things are happening in this house. What did you see in the park? I was setting a trap when a white figure came towards me. I asked: "Who's there?" It didn't answer but kept on walking. I repeated: "Who's there?" And suddenly it was behind me. I think it crossed through me. If I were you, I'd sleep in the castle tonight. He will make some space in his bed for you! A nice space, if your nose isn't too sensitive! Ghosts are like that. They cross through you like the wind in the trees. - A ghost? How was he? - White. That's all I saw. I think it's because of the fireworks. When you don't respect a cemetery... We won't be talking about this cemetery for long. The army will bomb it the day after tomorrow. It won't stop anything. Wait for him to come! I'm in charge of stopping the traffic. What's wrong with the milk now? The time I went back there, she was sleeping. When you're asleep, you don't feel hunger. Everybody is worrying. Ms Georgia says: "She's out of breath too quickly", "She must see a doctor" answers Ms Georgia's father... They'd better marry her off! Good evening, Ms. Ms, you'll catch a cold. I'll lend you my shawl. Good evening, Ms. Ms should not walk-around with this beautiful dress. Ms. Will tear it apart. Ms. Please answer me. Why don't you answer me? Lisa. Go away! Go away! It's nice. Yes. It's an air I have in my mind, tonight. Is it what Carmilla was playing the other night before the ball? Yes, it is. You have keen hearing. Who scored it? It's a sonata scored by a Karnstein 200 years ago. He never finished it, but it's an air we like very much. I've often tried to figure out how it might have continued Good night, my Beethoven. I've tried to find that for such a long time! You think you'll remember that tomorrow? Where do you plan to go after the wedding? To the Caribbean Sea. And you? I don't know... I'll probably go back to Austria. - To the castle on the lake. - In wintertime? Better stay here. At least the house is warm. - I always feel cold. - Why don't you come with us? - On your honeymoon?! - Why not? It's going to be summer time, there. Clear water, white sand... Actually it's black, but it doesn't matter, it's beautiful anyway. There's swordfish, who force through the waves! Suddenly, the fishing line is tightening. If you weren't fastened, you would fall to the sea! The battle starts! The swordfish is struggling. You're losing some line. It's a great swordfish. He's jumping over the waves! - Is your swordfish big as this? - No. Bigger! - Like this? - Still bigger! - Like this? - That's a sardine! Here's your swordfish! Oh, Leopoldo. We haven't laughed together for such a long time. Like before, when I was a little girl. You impressed me with your motorbikes and hunting riffles. Can you remember the night of the fire? You saved me. I was just wearing a shirt and was a bit ashamed. You were mostly afraid. Tonight I recognize the true Leopoldo. The true Karnstein. Why did you change? The Karnsteins are not a naturally happy family. I don't know who I'd be today without Georgia. With her everything is straight. - She's setting me free. - From whom, Leopoldo? From myself. From myself. Maybe you're right. It would be great to go there with you, to the middle of the sea. It's only up to you. Carmilla. - What's wrong with you. - Nothing, nothing. Oh, Leopoldo. Pardon me. I can't love anymore, Leopoldo, nor give pardon. She's dead. Yes. It's the vampire who killed her. - How do you know? - Giuseppe saw him. Remember? The white shape... So, you found the body at around 2 pm. - I found the body! - We ran to get Giuseppe. - He didn't believe us! - I know, I know. Sign here. A simple formality, Count. Lisa was your handmaid; you have to identify her. - Dr, what did you find? - Fractured skull... Broken spine, numerous bruises. She must have died instantaneously from her fall. It's now your job to determine why Lisa fell down. I think we all agree on this point, it could only be an accident. What did you think of this mark, doctor? To drink the blood, he opens the veins of the neck with his sharp teeth. - That's what made those blue marks. - Yes. - Where does he live? - Could be anywhere. In the forest, in a house... But every night, he has to go in his grave for a while. That's what I thought, she fell from 30 meters, her rosary got stuck in her neck. For the three of us, it's a regular bruise. But for the villagers, that's a vampire's brand. That's how legends begin. Legends run fast in this area. - Does he kill only women? - If it's a female vampire. - Why? - Because there's nothing to argue with! That's their law. - Is it true they're frightened of animals? - Yes. And they're afraid of sun. All their strength is in the wrist and if you hold a clove of garlic, They can't come close to you. - And it's not possible to kill them? - There's only one way: a stake in their heart The most terrible thing is when the vampire loves his victim, they will turn into a vampire after they're killed. Can you sign here, Count? Thank you. Giuseppe. Giuseppe. How did your ghost look? - My ghost, Count? - You know! The one you saw the other night. - Oh ! I didn't see much. - But you told everybody about it. - It was white. - What was white? - The ghost. - Why do you call it a "ghost"? - What was this white thing wearing - was it man or woman? I would say woman. Was the white thing a dress? Of course. If it was a woman, it was a dress. A long or short dress? - I can't say. - Come on, my boy. It stopped at the knees? At the ankles? It crossed through him! So it crossed through you? It could have... - Anyway, she was tall. - How do you know? She had to duck to pass under the olive tree branches. A ghost doesn't have to duck, it would crosses through the branches. Then, it was not a ghost. It can rain all night, Carmilla. Let's go to the house. Georgia, don't leave me alone! Of course I won't leave you alone. Are you unhappy? I don't know anymore. I feel so old. We can know how old a tree is. We can count the wrinkles of a woman... - You have no wrinkles. - You neither! - I have so many deaths behind me. - What do you mean? You look like a sphinx.. He ask riddles, and devours those who can't answer. I knew from the first day... that you loved Leopaldo. That's a heavy secret to carry. It's hurting you. I can help you. You just have to talk to me. Carmilla, can you hear me? Carmilla, talk to me. Answer me! Carmilla, answer me! Carmilla is dead. I don't know what you think but I'll always be your friend. We've been looking for you everywhere! - Why? - The storm, Ms. Leopaldo! It's nothing. I cut my finger with a thorn. Go change yourself quickly or you'll catch a cold. In one week, all the village's bells are going to ring. You'll be my wife and I don't want you sneezing! Thank you. - This house is bleak when it's raining - Excellent. My dear judge. You'll think I'm an eccentric. But I don't know if I was right to choose this manor to celebrate the wedding. - Where do you want to celebrate it? - Why not Venice? At your place. Poor Lisa. I still can't believe it. Carmilla, it's our last evening here. I got a telegram. I have to chair on a court of appeal. - We have to be in Venice tomorrow night. - What about the wedding? To avoid postponing, Leopoldo and I thought we'd celebrate it in Venice. I'm afraid. Giuseppe said if we have garlic, the vampire can't hurt us. - Where do we go? - Near the fox trap. That's where Giuseppe saw it. Carmilla. lam Millarca. Carmilla's dead. I killed her the night of the ball. - Leopoldo. Did you hear that'? - It's Georgia. Georgia. Millarca. Where is she? She's going to die. Millarca. Stay with her. I'll call the doctor. Georgia. What's wrong my dear? Georgia, speak. Millarca. She's going to die. Millarca. Carmilla... Carmilla... Carmilla... Are you here? Carmilla. - Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. Wait. It's not finished. Here's the line and detonator. We're ready, sir. OK. Go ahead. Thanks for coming so fast. She's better now, but I was very afraid. - Are you sure about the blue marks? - The same that Lisa had. Luckily, she screamed. That saved her life. - Carmilla? - Gone. I've looked for her everywhere. First Lisa. And now Georgia... How could she have done that? The announcement of your wedding must had been a terrible shock for her. Maybe you told her too suddenly. - Why didn't you tell me that before? - Tell you what? That she loved you? I thought she understood. That we can't always live like daydreaming children. She never stopped dreaming. She didn't want to suffer. So she escaped from herself by neurosis. Traumatism, neurosis, split personality... The defeated Carmilla became the uncompromising Millarca; the one who hurt people. When she killed Lisa, she didn't only obey the legend. She also Identified herself to the woman you love. Martha, Marie, come here! What are you doing outside? Where are you coming from? - Speak! - We saw the vampire. -Where? Near the fox trap. She was totally white. - Where was she going? - To the cemetery. We were too afraid to follow her. Millarca. - My dear. - It hurt me. Georgia married Leopoldo in Venice. They spent three months in the southern seas. A plane is bringing them home. They'll be there in a few hours. I gave you the medical explanation of an unusual phenomenon. But for those who believe in vampires, the legend didn't die with Millarca. It continues with the last female Karnstein: Georgia.
