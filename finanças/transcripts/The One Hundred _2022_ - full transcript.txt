Hello, everybody! Welcome to Kat's Vlog! Can you guess where we are today? Right, we're back on the road, but I can't seem to find the campsite. Where is it? I've been looking for hours. Well, excuse me then. No. 3 MONTHS AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19. On March 25, 2020, the government declared an Emergency Decree to contain the spread of the virus. Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, Prime Minister and Defense Minister, invoked his special administrative power to declare an Emergency Decree to prevent the outbreak of the new coronavirus, or Covid-19, to be in effect from March 26th, 2020. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Driver. Look at your costume. Fancy. And this is the hotel where we'll spend our next 14 days in quarantine. It looks pretty beat up from the outside, but maybe it's better inside, let's take a look. Thank you. Dear guests, I'm Prawit, the manager of the Srichanpen Hotel. For your own safety and to comply with the authorities' measures, our hotel mandates a strict social distancing rule. According to the quarantine procedure, once you've checked in, please remain inside your room. You're strictly prohibited from leaving it. Your social media account, please. In case we need to contact you. COVID-19 PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE CONGENITAL DISEASES - SMOKING HABITS Hi, take this thermometer. Check your temperature every morning and evening, and write it down here. Our staff will come and collect it. This is your thermometer. Check your temperature every morning and evening and write it down here. Our staff will come and collect it. Miss Tevika, do you have any congenital diseases? No. If there's any problem, inform us right away. So we can handle it in time. Are you done? Pond. Clean up every room on every floor. We're going to take more quarantine guests. I can't possibly do that all by myself. There's too much work. - June, recruit more housekeepers. - Yes, sir? I put up an ad days ago. - But no one has applied. - Why? We were in the news for being a Covid cluster site, it has scared people away. Right, then give her a hand. I'll go check the 7th floor. Come, now. Shit! Pond! - There's some animal here. - Where? - Let's push the bed. - It's right here! - Help me. - Okay. - Shit! - Centipedes eating a rat? Disgusting. They're coming! Kem, you must be vigilant. Make sure everyone stays in their own rooms. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Wait... Sir? What are you doing? Hey! Sir! Mister, what are you doing? Come on. Stealing prawns? You can't do this. It's not... - No. - What? - What are you...? - My son is allergic to prawns. I'm so sorry about this. We'll get you another one. - Kem, take him back to his room. - Yes, sir. Please come with me. Take him now. Lena. Yes? Can I ask you something? Sure. Does your brother always have a quick temper? Well, he has this chemical problem in his head. But it's nothing serious. Let me show you something. Leo just competed in a Taekwondo match in South Korea. Won a gold medal too. Let me show you the clip. Look, he's super-cool! Not only cool and talented, my brother is also single. Just say it and I'll hook you up with him. Peddling your brother to a stranger, huh. Go back to your room now. Okay. Why do you have to have an operation? Can't you just take the medicine? I don't want you to get hurt. I won't get hurt. The doctor will make me sleep first. Will you become strong again? Of course. One of the guests is severely allergic to prawns. I want an explanation. I'm really sorry. I'll check the menu again. I won't tolerate a mistake like this again. Is that clear? Yes, Mr. Wit. Is there anything else I should worry about? Yes. After this clip went viral, the resort was forced to shut down. Fiew, isn't this pretty disgusting? I bet they never cleaned this thing up. Like chewing an eraser. It looks good, but it should taste good too. It's an F. Hey. Did you take your medicine? Is it time already? So what about the treatment? Forget it. I've seen too many doctors. None made me any better. - I think... - Stop it, Fame. I disagree. As your brother, I'm worried. We only have each other. - Besides... - Stop, stop. Enough with the drama. Have you started editing? The customer wants it on Monday. Send me the clip first. Right away. Bye now. INFIRMARY Kat, did you see today's registration file? Oh, it's not on your desk? Yes, Mom. Tonight? I can't. I'm on shift tonight. Okay, I'll let you know. Bye, Mom. Do you need to be at home? I can cover your shift, don't worry. Are you sure? Thank you. Boss Sompol, you came all the way here. What can I do for you, sir? Sit down. Oh, okay. Thank you, sir. - Wit. - Yes? I'll stay here tonight. Oh... right. Not a problem, sir. I'll put you in a suite. - Good. - Sure. - And your friend... - Oh. - She's negative, don't worry. - Oh, okay. - And I'll do another test too. - Right. It's just a common cold. Are you scared? No! It's just a cold. Nothing to be scared of. Just treat the symptoms. I'm relieved! After you authorized my hotel to take quarantine guests. I breathed so much easier. You're like a brother to me. I do what I can. No problem at all. I'm so grateful, sir. - It's nothing. - Thank you so much. Thanks, Kat. See you tomorrow. See you. Oh, one more thing. I think Miss Fame in Room 711 has some kind of serious blood disease. But she denied it. Can you take note of it? Sure. - Mr. Wit! - Woah... - We have a problem. - What is it, Pond? I saw... What? - You saw what? - Hi, Mr. Wit. - So? - Nothing. What? What's wrong with her? And who are you? Take off the mask. I'm Kat. I've just started working here with May. Kat? Since you're here, can you get me some pills? What pills? Stress... relief. If you can't find them, just ask May. May's just left. Her mother needed her at home. Great. But I'll take care of it. I know what you want. Guys, there are several genuses of centipedes. Each of them has a varying number of legs from dozens to hundreds. Their body segments grow longer after each molting. The largest centipede ever recorded is this big guy called... a "Tabongplum." Ancient legend has it that Tabongplums survived by possessing a human body and sucking its blood dry. Then it would discard the old body and seek a new one to possess, and so on, to extend their body segments and grow more legs. What's going on here?! She's going crazy. Is she possessed or what? So scary. I can't stay here. Shit! Shit! Leo, the tap water looks like blood, so gross. Not a corpse in the water tank, I hope. Yeah, same here. I'll call them. You're not allowed to leave the room. Look who's talking. Sick of the four walls? I suppose. Hey, wait! Hey, my lighter! Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing here? Okay, let's take a look. Where is it? Where's the body? Your dead body, where is it? But I did see a corpse here. That's impossible. But we both really saw it. - Let's call the cops. - Whoa, wait a minute. You've got no evidence, nothing. And if there really is a corpse, you are the suspects. And if the hotel's reputation is ruined, I'll sue both of you... What now? What the hell is going on? Kem, go check on it. - Are you hurt? - I'm fine. I have a tolerance to poisonous animals. The figures today have risen... - More fatalities every day. - 400 deaths. They said we'd be drowning in vaccines. I haven't had even one shot. How about you? I have. How lucky. I'm a nurse. We're a high-risk group. So are taxi drivers. Aren't our lives worth saving? Damn, what does he want? Hello, May speaking. What do you take my hotel for? You are a department head! And you switched your shift with a trainee? Is that acceptable? For what you did tonight, let me tell you, I can fire you right now. Please don't do that. I promise it won't happen again. Please give me a chance. Maybe... I will give you a chance. But it depends... on how obedient you are. Kat. Where were you? The boss just lashed out at me big time. Kat, wait! Hey, Leo. I heard something going on outside. What happened? It's nothing. How's Dad? How would I know? I'll ask him then. But Leo, when will you stop being mad at him? - You know Dad... - Lena. I told you we won't discuss this again. Why do you always think for me? Just like Dad, right? He made decisions for all of us without asking. You are so unreasonable. I'll hang up now. Mom. Mom. Wake up and talk to me. Mom. Don't you miss me, Mom? Hey! You okay? Help! Hey! What's going on in there? So what you're trying to say is someone attacked you and jumped out of the window from the 7th floor. Do you think your joke is funny? We're not joking. Didn't you see my room? And look at his face! Miss Fame. You're a YouTuber, aren't you? Maybe you're creating a situation to use in your video. Right, maybe you got paid to discredit my hotel. Nonsense. We can sue you for libel. But do you have any evidence that something happened? And who will pay for the damage? Let's check the CCTV images. Sir, the system isn't working. We need a technician, but they already left. We have to wait until tomorrow. Exactly what I expected. I came out to smoke. Your stupid cameras didn't even flag me. I want to move my family to another hotel. Please arrange it for us. Take it easy. We... Do it now! My family and I want to move out now. Okay, but... it has to be tomorrow... by protocol. I'm okay, go look after her. Right. I'm fine. You should be very careful. Your condition can be fatal if you are injured. How do you know about her condition? I saw her medicine labels. I used to take care of a patient who had the same illness. Don't worry. I'll live. There's still a lot more I want to expose. Thank you. Fiew, so what happened exactly? They said there was a corpse but it vanished. Then some kind of monster came out. Scared? Nope. Your room's a mess, you can't sleep in there. Fame, come with me. Are you hurt? Lena. Tell me what happened. Fame's brother said there was a corpse but it vanished. And there's a monster too. Really? I told you, it's nothing. Come on, why can't you tell me? Because I'm not sure what happened. Go to sleep. Bye. Wait! Damn it. DAD, CAN I GO SLEEP IN YOUR ROOM? WHY? I'M COMING OVER NOW This way, Miss May. It came it here, be careful. Is it here? IS LENA IN YOUR ROOM? NO, WHY? SHE SAID SHE WAS SCARED AND WANTED TO COME TO MY ROOM BUT SHE HASN'T SHOWN UP Hey, stay in your room! Lena. Lena. My sister's disappeared. Have you seen her? No, I haven't seen anyone. - Open the door! - What the hell? Okay, coming. - What is it? - Is Lena here? No. - Why? - She's disappeared. - Not in the room? - No. Lena! Lena! Be careful, Fame. Lena! Lena! - Found her? - No. - Can't find her. - Let's check the basement. Okay. - Lena. - Lena! Lena! Lena! Lena! Le... What the fuck?! Is that your sister? Why didn't you take care of her? - Why did you let her wander out? - You. Huh? - Why did you let her out of her room? - Hey! Hey! - Why did you tell her? - What are you talking about? - Hey! - Why the fuck did you tell her? - I didn't do anything! - Why did you tell her? Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! That's enough! Stop blaming others! Isn't this bad enough? Fighting won't help. - What's wrong with you? - Pull yourself together! What's going on here? You all right? Leo. Fuck! What is this shit? Whose body is this? What should we do, Mr. Wit? Let me think... I'll talk to the cops myself. Don't tell anyone about this. Someone died and you try to cover it up? You still have no idea who the killer might be, and you expect us to spend the night here, huh? This is my hotel. I'll handle it the way I want. Stay the fuck out of it. Fine. Then handle the social media mob yourself. Wait! Okay, I got it. Well... I'll move you to another hotel. Okay? Happy now? Close that thing. Lena. Say something. Or just make a sound. Lena. Lena. What's wrong with her? Physically, nothing's wrong with her. But it looks like she has PTSD. She must've experienced something horrible or extremely traumatic. Her nerves are still in shock. - May. - Yes? - The manager's calling an urgent meeting. - Okay. Excuse me. - Yes. - Yes. I have something to tell you. Something to tell me? It may be hiding inside one of the guests. The monster. This place is not safe. Do not trust anyone except our own family. I will find a way out of here. Don't go anywhere. I will come back. I am so happy that you are talking to me again. Leo, be careful. I will. Dear guests, we have an emergency situation. A dead body has been discovered in the hotel. I've already contacted the police. They suspect that the murderer is still inside the hotel. Therefore, you must remain in your rooms. Do not leave your room, not for a second. And one more thing, please hand in your cell phones so we can give them to the police as evidence. Thank you. Yes, Mr. Wit. I'm on my way. Mr. Leo, I've been knocking. - What's the matter? - Your phone, please. The manager wants it for the police. Thank you. Now go back to your room. - Okay. - Excuse me then. Lock all doors and exits. Don't let anyone out of the hotel. Yes, sir. Yes? Hey, what's going on? Who died? We don't know yet. What we know is... it's a murder. What? A fucking murder? Shit! I'm out of here! Make sure my name never comes up. The reporters will eat me alive. Selfish prick. Hurry up. Hey, get me out of here. Shit! Hey! Hey! Hey! Gotcha! - Fiew, we have to run. - Yeah, go! Your medicine. Thank you. Centipedes! Run! Fiew! Fiew! Fiew! See you in the lobby. Come! INFIRMARY Lena. Lena. Lena. Le... Leo. Lena. Where's Dad? He's looking for you. Help! Help. Let me in. Wait up. Get out of here! I'm okay. Let's take the fire exit. Follow me. This way! Hurry. What's that? Leo. Come this way. What do we do now? Fame. Ready? Go! - Shit. - This way! Have you seen my children? I don't understand it. - What? - My children? Just run! Go! - Fame! - Fiew! - Dad. - Where's May? Get over here. - What the hell? - You, come here. Not you. Her. This handsome dickhead is your brother? - Yes, I'm her brother. - Good. Come here, or your brother's dead. I fucking mean it. Come! - I'm not joking, bitch! - Fiew! - Bastard! - Stay still! - Don't move! - Don't hurt her! - Hey, I've got her for you! - Ouch! Hey! - Come and take her now! - Let go of me! - You promise to let me go. - Fiew! Don't forget that. - How come that thing only wants me? - Shut up! How could I know? - Why don't you ask the fucker yourself? - Ouch! Come on. She's all yours. Let's get it over with. Now! Mr. Wit, let them go. It's none of your business. Or I'll expose you. Useless piece of shit. - You're fired. - Ouch! Let me go! Come and take this bitch! - Let me go! - I want to get out of here! You're a bunch of troublemakers! You're driving me crazy! You're nothing but trouble. Assholes, you're the end of me! Come on! I want to get the fuck out of here! What? What are you looking at? You can't fool me. - Shit! - Fiew! Shit! Go! Run! Lena, come on! Don't shoot. I didn't do it! How do we know you didn't? I really didn't. She was breathing a minute ago! How do we know you're not that monster? What monster? What are you talking about? The monster that caused all this mess. What is it? All I see is centipedes crawling everywhere. Not them. It's this monstrous thing... that can live inside anybody. If it can live inside anybody, it could be any one of you. When I saw it in the laundry room, I heard it cough, it sounded exactly like Fame. Wait. Wit said I'm its target. So it can't be me. How do we know it's not you? If it were me, I'd have shot you all dead and kidnapped Fame by now. Maybe it's your father or Lena. They were always sneaking out. I don't think it's any of us. Or we'd all be dead already. It's not me. Then how do you explain this? When I got here, May was already like this. I didn't do anything. May? Yes. But before she died, she tried to say something. Someone's name. It's... Fiew. Run! Enough. That's enough. Stop it. I don't know why you want this sick body. But if you want it alive, let them go. Are you in there, Fiew? Are you in there? Are you? Fiew, my brother. Are you in there? Let me have this body. I'll return it later. Let me go! Let me go now! Let me go! Asshole! Let me go! IF I DON'T WAKE UP, DON'T TRY TO KEEP ME ALIVE TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS FOR ME I LOVE YOU AND OUR CHILDREN WITH ALL MY HEART When you get out of the hospital, let's go to the beach together. After the surgery, your wife's body is not responding to the treatment. She's now brain-dead. A moment, please. I'm afraid of the operation. Don't be afraid. Wake up, Mom. Let go of me. Mom! Mom! I'm tired. You can't die now. Take your pill. I won't. Until I see that Fiew is still alive. You'd better hurry. My time is running out. Fiew... Fiew... Dad! Dad! Dad! What do you want? I want Fame's blood. Why her? Can't it be someone else? No. Her blood is different. It will let me live for a long time. Fame. You okay? Here's your pill. Take it. Come on. Take it. Now swallow. Swallow. Good. Fiew! Can you get up? Hang in there. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Let's go. Go! IN CASE OF LEAKAGE, TURN OFF THE VALVE See you in hell. Lena! Leo! We have to go now. Let's go this way. Dad! Hurry up. You know where we're going? Ouch! Fiew! Fiew! Welcome to my hotel. A suite... Leo! - Lena. - Leo. Leo! ONE YEAR LATER After that night, I'm no longer the sick girl I used to be. Its poison somehow cured my blood disease. I've survived long enough to see the centipedes crawl their way to the top of the food chain, where they used to be. Stop. Wait. What's your name? My name's Jae-gun. Did you call for help? Yes. Please get me out of here. - A tiger-striped centipede. - Wow. You can tell at a glance? Just guessing. Wash it with warm water. Give me your lighter. I quit smoking. I have one. Where did you get this lighter? From a guy who rescued me. Are you Fame? He asked me to return it to you.
