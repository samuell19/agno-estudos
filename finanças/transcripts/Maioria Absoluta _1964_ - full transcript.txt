LEON HIRSZMAN PROJECT ABSOLUTE MAJORITY "HIGH RESOLUTION PICTURE(2k) AND SOUND DIGITALLY RESTORED FROM A FINAL COPY." RESTORATION SPONSORED BY THE PETROBRAS CULTURAL PROGRAM ...i, o, u Give me an A Hail Mary Give me a B, Bountiful and Beautiful ABSOLUTE MAJORITY Give me a C Corfim of Grace And a D Divine Star This movie is not about teaching people to read and write. It's about the illiteracy that marginalizes 40 million of our brothers. We decided to look for its causes by getting opinions and testimony from people who deal with this problem on different levels - My God! - Explain that! - Come on, say it! - Come on, say it! - Say what? - What causes this problem? - Just to keep the sound level. - Say it. Are we recording this? What's the cause of this problem, Fernandinho? - There's no crisis. - There's no crisis. The big Brazilian crisis is a moral crisis. And parodying an old Brazilian writer and politician, I'd say that our Constitution should have just one article and one paragraph: "Every Brazilian should behave ethically." But not everyone agrees with that it's just a problem of morals. The thing is that our people are very lazy. Sometimes they don't know how to accept the things they're given to help them get ahead. If they don't start by providing an education for those - who are born, above all... - Right. ...teaching them how to write... There are other worries. The person who only knows how to write his name, this guy can't vote, he's not qualified, he can't read the papers, he can't... he can't get informed enough to vote correctly. And that's a disgrace. I have the impression that this country should import people: 20,000 Germans, 60,000 Englishmen and Americans... and that would be a large group, a whole lot of honest people: British, German, Dutch and even American people. ...sexual weakness, diseases and pain, compressed aches, rheumatism, syphilis, inflammation of the eyes, headache, constipation, people who have constant headaches, all they have to do is drink this beverage, grab one of these packages... So many problems, and so many opinions. Against syphilis, belly ache and baldness, they recommend the same medicine: the beverage. What about illiteracy? Diseases, like social illnesses have causes, and because they don't know them, people look for miraculous cures, absurd solutions, just to escape from the oppressing reality. Illiteracy doesn't happen by chance. In the big urban areas, where income is higher and diseases are not widespread there are fewer illiterate people. It's in the small villages where life expectancy is lower, that illiteracy reaches a high percentage. Can that he a mere coincidence? Of 3,500 Brazilian municipalities, 2,700 have no medical assistance whatsoever. In the Northeast, where 25 million people live, 60% of the families don't eat meat, 80% don't eat eggs and 50% don't drink milk. Let's hear from the illiterates, they are the absolute majority. It's like that all the time, he's been shaking for the last 11 years. He hurt himself working on a sugarcane plantation. It seems that he cut a nerve in his wrist and he began to shake. It began on the tip of one finger then moved on to the others, then to rest of his body, and there he is. When it got to his head, he bit his tongue, he swallowed his food and his tongue. I gave him some purgative made of German liquor and he calmed down. One gives me 10, one gives me 20, another one, 100, another one, 50, another 2,000 “réis", another 10 cents, another, 500 “réis", and I get by, as God wants. That's my life. I have no father, I have no mother. My son left for São Paulo and forsook me. I've been here for 13 years, that's my situation. My life consists of asking for help from citizens, majors, colonels, lieutenants, no matter who, that'll be my life till Jesus calls me. 8 million children like these don't have schools. Illiteracy lives here. Not in the open, breezy homes, not in the concrete and glass buildings of the big cities. It lives in the huts with wet floors, in the houses made of clay, in the huts made of tin. That's where it lives. Under that straw roof, on this earthy ground, among these ruined walls, that's where illiteracy lives and thrives. It eyes its victims in the dark, like the Chagas disease, worms and hunger. Here in the Northeast we use straw roofs, I don't know if they use them in the huts too. That straw can last three years but sometimes it takes them four to five years to change it. So they believe it becomes a sieve that lets them see what's happening in the sky: if there's rain, sun, dew, stars at night, the moon, whatever, we can see everything. Man can't understand, Man can't study, Man can't manufacture, Man can't manage, Man can't make, Man can't love, a hungry man can't love! A hungry man is not interested in women, he can't love. He can be right next to the most beautiful woman on earth, if he's hungry. He'll tell the woman to back off. I'm going to look for food. He'll leave her no matter what. I mean, what's really useful, necessary for human beings, for an animal, is food. Food. We only plant food in 3% of the cultivated land in Brazil. That's because the bosses just want sugarcane. One can't see a plot with manioc, corn or cotton plantations in a sugarcane mill. But you see a lot of naked people. Naked... a lot of people in terrible conditions. A lot. That's what you see with workers in the sugarcane industry. ...and we're worth nothing. If I had more land, a larger piece of land, a valley, I'd plant and I'd have crops all year long, I'd have a better life, I wouldn't work for the owner of the mill, just for the sugarcane mill. When you work for yourself your life's more complete, more relaxed, longer, it's not like the life we live. Our life's painful. We leave early, at sunrise, no matter if it's rainy or sunny. Those who work their own land, when morning comes and it's raining, they have the right to have breakfast, wait for sunrise, and then go to work. But not us, no matter if it's sunny or rainy, the guy has to go. Under the rain, under the sun, under the dew. What I mean is that it's like forced labor. It's as if we were prisoners. It's forced labor. Our life is just like the life of a prisoner. No freedom at all. That's what our life's like. I've worked for these men for uncountable years. I vote, I have my papers and I vote every year but I can never buy anything. Not even for my five children, I never had the right to register them, so they could get their rights from these men. But I did better than the weak ones, I had a chance to be heard, but nobody was interested in me, and I'm still suffering from hunger, nudity, suffering with my family. This woman lives with me, she works every day to earn her bread and feed our children. If we want to survive. Brazil was discovered In the year 1500. In the year 1534 D. João III of Portugal divided Brazil into provinces that were given to members of his court. From 1535 on, the owners began to distribute their land among other nobles and rich men. They imported slaves to work the land, and these slaves had no rights at all. Since I learned how to count until today I've worked hard. - How many children? - I have five. - How many miscarriages? - Three, two live ones, one dead and two abortions too. And I've never had what I needed, I lacked everything, but I've always given my best at work, worked a lot, and I'm always free. In 1876 there were 10 million inhabitants in Brazil and only 20 thousand landowners. There were 80 million Brazilians in 1964, and just 70 thousand owned 60% of the land in the country. 12 million peasants don't own any land. 6 million never touched money. After work, I cultivate my piece of land. I'm going to cultivate my piece of land so that next year I'll have the manioc to make flour and sustain myself. I hardly rest at all after lunch and keep working till 5. I feel like going to fetch some firewood to make flour, dig up manioc to make some flour. I'll do that if I have time, if not, I'll do it tomorrow. No money, no comfort, no salary, a street artist makes one "conto" and 200. I've made 600 thousand "réis" in the last 15 days. 500 thousand "réis". I'll sit here for a while. Look, I built that building, that little house. I built my house on the inside lot. I built that garage behind the church. There's another house over there that I built myself. I do everything: I paint, I clean and I never get behind schedule. I support myself with my work. My time is up but I'm still strong. What can I do with a 600-thousand- "réis" salary in times like these? They'll starve to death, you know? The needy peasant, deprived of everything, never sleeping well, not eating enough...with nothing to eat. He's going to buy... If he owes 10 "tostões", he's happy if he doesn't get beaten. If he says something, he gets shot. See, he's like a prisoner because there's no food for him. He can't buy a shirt for his son. His wife is naked, sleeping on the floor, no clothes, she can't travel, you hear me? How can a person live like that? He can't, right? I bought a pair of shoes but I can't wear them, either my feet grew or the shoes shrank. These are my only trousers. I wear them to dance, to go to the market, to cut sugarcane. I won't lie about what I have, you know? I never stole anything. I didn't have the courage, but I wanted to just to get some food. Yes. Right. You've got to see that, boss. I have red beans at home donated by the government. I ate a lot of beans, that was all I had yesterday. I had no breakfast today. No food. And I didn't miss it. They created a situation to expel him from the house, that he wasn't registered, that he had no rights. He said, "Do I have to leave the house now? No problem, I'll leave now." He said, "All right, I'm leaving." "Right now!" Then he said, "I can't leave now. I can't leave now." And the men gave him 30... 90 days. They gave him 90 days more to stay in the house. He said he wouldn't leave the house before 90 days, before he straightened things out. And he went to the union. I was starving. The money I make is not enough, I'm happy about my dedication, I'm always willing to work, I cultivated a piece of land, I forced myself to do that. Last year, I cultivated a little lot, and Galvão, a foreman, tried to destroy it. He said he'd come with some guys to destroy my field. And I waited for him to do it. I wouldn't say anything. After he did it, I'd do something about it. I would never fight him, but I had to look out for my rights, because that field was supposed to feed me, my children, my wife. Why would the foreman of the mill destroy it, in that no man's land? Because that's what it is, the woods. That's our situation here. Now we're asking the authorities to give peasants their rights. We don't want what belongs to the boss, we want justice. That's what we need. A father of seven who lives here has to go to the cooperative, a farmworker has to buy his flour to eat at lunchtime. That's hideous, that's a shame for me. That's a shame, that's hideous. All these peasants, all this land and I can only buy two pounds of flour! Only city people can buy stuff, blue collar workers that don't work the land. But peasants? Who's to blame? The landowner. He keeps the land for himself and doesn't let peasants work the land. Of 40 million illiterate Brazilians, 25 million, above 18 aren't allowed to vote. But they produce your sugar, your coffee, your daily lunch. They give the country their lives, their children's lives, and what does the country give them? - Attention! The movie ends here. Out there, your life, like these men's, goes on. THE END
