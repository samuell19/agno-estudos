My baby! My baby! Captain, there's an open gas line. It's not safe. Theo! We are not leaving a baby to die. Let's go! ...who was killed in a tragic car accident last night when the vehicle lost control, crashing into... Theo? Theo? Theo? No, leave me alone. Angie? - Hello? - Mikaela... What? Now, Mikaela, go! Sam? M-Tech’s systems are supposedly impenetrable. But you hacked them three times in the last six months. Sensitive stuff that you stole. Highly classified intelligence. You only get your hands on documents like those if you know exactly where to find them. So... who’s your source? Do you know what happens when a human body burns? Hmm? Do you? Your muscles melt first and that exposes your nerve endings. It’s so unbearably painful that your brain goes into shock and your heart stops, and within seconds you’re dead as a doornail. But... Yes, this stuff keeps that shock at bay. Shh! Hey, hey, hey, hey! And you feel everything. And best of all, the best part is that we can do it over and over again. As long as it takes, until you start talking. Come now, come, come... Please! Please, don't do this. Please! Please don't do this. Mikaela, listen. I’m going to be honest with you, okay? There’s no question of you leaving here alive, okay? The only question you need to answer is how much pain... you’re willing to experience before you die. Okay. Hey! Samuel Isaacs. He worked for M-Tech in the '90s, doing research and development out of Joburg. He’s the one that wants to expose everything, the one we’ve been looking for all along. Where’s he now? We’re on his trail. Jesus, Ernst, I thought you had him. What does he have? Enough. Doesn’t matter. He won’t have a chance to use it. Wes... eat your breakfast. Otherwise you’ll be late for school. I don’t mind. Just give me the money, that’s way easier, isn’t it? That’s not how it works, Wesley, and you know it. Come on, Mommy, I know the Tooth Fairy is a hoax. Says who? Says everyone and if she’s real, where was she last night? Maybe she’ll come tonight. I’m too old for that stuff. I mean, a real Tooth Fairy would be fair, and leave at least R20 for a tooth. R5 is peanuts. Hello? Are you saying the Tooth Fairy is stingy? No, I’m saying you are. - Wesley, go brush your teeth. - Already done. Please, drop it now, Angie. Not all of us can afford that attitude. - Be good, my baby. - I always am. I know, that’s why you’re my number one, my champ. Hmm? Do you know who just popped in while you were in the bathroom? Do you? The Tooth Fairy. - Don’t spend it all at once, okay? - I can’t make any promises. Let’s go. Theo... good luck today. Okay. Yeah? Eddie, I'm gonna call you back in a minute. Theo Abrams. You look like shit. You got fat. Bloody hell. - I've missed you. - I've missed you too, man. Looks like you're managing just fine without me. Eh... I, um... I just saw two trucks heading into town. Yeah. Flare-up on the mountain, so we're relief support. Did you say howzit to the guys? Hmm. How are things? I'm good. I'm fine. I, uh, took the time off as I was asked. But now I'm ready to come back. You know my hands are tied until psych clears you. Ugh, come on, Moses, you know I don't need a shrink. You still getting those blackouts? I'm fine. What does Angie think? You're not gonna wanna hear this. But I've been asked to find a permanent replacement for you. The District Chief's been informed that you're... you're resisting treatment. Yes, because it's a fucking waste of time, Moses. It's not weak to ask for help. How many times have we seen this? Guys who'd rather sit back and watch their lives fall apart instead of getting the help that they need. We soldier on, even though we know we shouldn't. Now, ask yourself, how does it always end up? If you're as fine as you say you are... then get the doc to give you your clearance. Theo! We have a civic responsibility to ensure our ability to help others. How am I, how is anyone supposed to help you if you won't help yourself? It's good to see you too. Chief. Hello, this is Angela Abrams. - Hello? - Can I speak to Theo Abrams? Sorry, you just missed him. He left his phone at home. - Can I take a message? - When will he be back? I’m not sure. Anything I can help you with? - Hello? - You’re a journalist for the Cape Atlantic. That’s right. To whom am I speaking? A friend. I have a lead for you. - It involves your husband. - What about him? He needs our help, Angela. Can you and I meet? It’s urgent. Okay, take down my email address, then we can... We don’t have that kind of time. You have to trust me. Meet me at 11:00 a.m., Pier place, on Adderley, and come alone, right? - Your husband’s life depends on it. - Who the hell are you? I’m glad you phoned me, Theo. Thank you. I should be thanking you, Doc. I know it’s short notice. How are you? How are things at home? The last time I saw you, you were ashamed, because you felt you didn’t deserve to live, that you should have died in that fire. I know what I said. That’s why I lost my job, isn’t it? Do you still feel that way? What do you think? I think you’re here... and that’s a good start, at least. You know how this works, Theo. The computer sends signals to your brain that stimulate your subconscious. Okay? The sensors do all the work. All you need to do is relax. Okay? Theo. Breathe. You’re safe, I’m here. You’re safe. You have to relive this trauma. That way, over time, your brain can minimize the emotional pain. Then we can manage it. But it won’t work if you fight against it. Trust my process, Theo. Let’s go this way. Sir, I hate cloak-and-dagger stuff like this. And once someone threatens my family... Listen, Angela. You can trust me. Your husband needs my help, and I need yours, so... So, take a seat. Please? Who are you? My name is Sam. I’ll get straight to the point. I have proof of a huge government conspiracy. I’m talking about the higher ups’ higher ups. - You’re familiar with M-Tech? - An army contractor? Not a contractor, the contractor. Murder, treason, you name it. And they’ll do anything to stop me, because I have proof. And I’m at the end of my rope. But we shouldn’t actually be talking here. It’s not safe here. - What’s your ETA? - We’re almost there. Do not lose them. Please, start from the beginning. You said my husband’s life is in danger. Yes. A long time ago, I worked for M-Tech. Research and development. The things I saw during those two years. Some people will do anything in the name of national security. I’m talking about assassinations, biological weapons, extreme defense initiatives. The type of stuff that would give you nightmares. Fourteen years. That’s how long I’ve been trying to expose them, but they’re always one step ahead of me. Last night. They killed my partner last night. What? The woman who was helping me find the classified documents. The last thing she gave me, right? Is a list with a bunch of detailed profiles of people all across Africa. They’re seemingly unconnected, except for this, they’re either dead, or in jail. Your husband’s name is on that list, Angela, and I promise you, it’s not a mistake. Our time’s up. Check out that black BM, they’re looking for me. Listen, I haven’t been able to work out the connection with your husband, but only 11 of the people on that list are in the Cape and he’s one of them. I’ve tried contacting the rest. Two are behind bars, three are already dead, and the others have just disappeared. Your husband is a target. Why and for what reason, I don’t know. All I ask of you now, Angela, is to trust me. Daddy? Wesley, shouldn’t you be in bed? Where’s mommy? Okay, mommy will be here soon, okay? Okay? Come on, go back to bed. Hi, you've reached Angela Abrams, please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Angie, it’s me again. Where are you? Let me know where you are, please. It’s getting late. - You scared me! - What are you busy with, Angie? - Hi, Theo. - Hi. Where were you? - I had something important to do. - Angie, I’ve been phoning you all day, but apparently my own wife doesn’t answer my calls. Angie? Angie? Angie? What are you doing? - Where’s Wesley? - Wesley’s sleeping, has been for ages. Angie, where were you? And what are you putting in that box? Angie! Come. I got a call this morning. He was actually looking for you. To let you know your life is in danger. What? He asked to meet with me, so I went to see him. Wait, wait, who? What’s his name? Sam. Samuel Isaacs. He worked for M-Tech a long time ago. Samuel... What is M-Tech? The big defense contractor. Sam showed me a file, Theo. The file that M-Tech has on you is full of personal info. Okay, like what? Your whole life, our life, it’s all there. Inside the metadata of an account that’s linked to M-Tech. I don’t understand what you’re telling me. I’m still trying to process everything myself. That metadata has the same kind of info on 463 people. People with no connection to one another, completely random, except... Except what? About half the people are either dead... or in jail. Okay. For what? Murder. Attempted murder. It’s not always the same. Sam thinks it’s linked to a program at M-Tech. Something to do with assassinations. If it’s true, it’s beyond horrifying. And a massive story, so I’m preparing to publish all of it, the government will have to investigate. - To me, the whole sounds... - Totally crazy, - yes. - Yes. I know, Theo, but I saw the evidence Sam has. He used to work for M-Tech and he has solid inside info. Names, accounts, testimonies. It’s all there. It points to a conspiracy at the highest levels. And if we don’t do something now... What does this whole thing have to do with me? I mean, I... I don’t know yet. Okay, Angie, what if all of this is just a bunch of nonsense? What if this is just some crazy guy... Of course, that was my first thought, Theo. But what about the alternative? - Okay, what’s the alternative? - What if all of it’s true, and they come looking for you? Theo, just go take a shower, then we can talk, once you’re sober. Angie, Angie, Angie. Don’t be judgmental, please. All right? You’re not the one that lost their job today, I am. I lost my job, not you. Right? After I was forced to see the psychiatrist... - Forced? - I was forced, Angie. Theo, your PTSD is only getting worse, I can tell. - Oh, my PTSD, is that right? - Every night it’s more nightmares - and more blackouts. - Yes, yes... The guys want you to open up about what happened... - Oh, the guys... - Talk, so that you can heal and be my husband again! I am your husband, and I’m standing right in front of you. - No, no, Theo, you’re not. - Where am I then? I’m all alone and you’re drinking the day away. - Like that’s an original solution. - Oh, I drink the day away? I do nothing but drink? - Yes, Theo! - Fuck you! Yes, fuck you! Mommy? Mm-hmm? Are you and daddy getting divorced? Of course not, my dear. Adults argue sometimes, but we still love each other. And you. Why is daddy always so angry? Your dad is going through a very tough time, Wes. But he’s doing his best. Close your eyes now. I love you. Angie, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. You have to believe me, please. Trust me. Do you even trust yourself, Theo? We are not leaving a baby to die. You’re up early, Angie. Angie? Angie? Angie! Come on, Angie, come on, come on! No! No! No! No! Daddy? Hey. Hey. Police! Open the door! Open this door immediately! Police! Open up! Where’s your wife? Stay where you are. Step away from that child. I’m going to tell you one more time, get away from that child! Now! He killed his wife. Give me the child. Let go of the child! Give the child to me. - Leave the child alone! - Let go of me! You are arrested on murder charges. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you... Mr. Abrams? I am Detective Williamson. Can you tell me what happened? Mr. Abrams. I don’t know, I... I can’t... - Where’s my son? - He’s speaking to another detective. Is there anyone we can contact? Wesley, everything will be all right, okay? Don’t worry. Everything will be all right, Wesley. Where’s he going? - Where are you taking him? - Mr. Abrams... I didn’t do it. I didn’t do anything. I’d never hurt my Angie, you have to believe me. I’d never hurt Angie, please. You have to believe me! Why would I hurt Angie? I love her. I love Angie, please. Please. Please. Psst. No, hey, no! No, hey, no! Help! Help! Jack! Stand back! Stand back! Stop moving! Hands in the air! Hands behind your head! Stay where you are! I want an APB across all channels. I want units patrolling every hospital, every clinic in the area, because if he's injured, he's going to need medical attention. Lock a perimeter around the city. How the hell did that happen? Theodore Abrams. Deputy Station Commander at Salt River fire station. Now, we received a tip-off this morning about some suspected domestic violence at his home. When our units arrived, we found his wife has been murdered. Theo was arrested as a prime suspect, but he has since escaped custody, killing four of our men. And one more person, who was in police custody. Now, the man is considered to be armed and dangerous. Not only is he the deputy station commander, but he's trained in emergency operations, search and rescue. He's done three years with the SANDF fire academy and he volunteers, self-defense training in some of our own units. The man is an impressive target. On any other day, we'd be celebrating him. How are we going to approach this thing? No, sit, sit, sit, sit. General Shard, I didn’t think you would... Relax, Williamson, relax. Mike Richards and Julian Tsepe were two of my captains. I’m doing this for them. I understand the victim was a journalist, yes? Yes, the online reporter for the Cape Atlantic. That means the media will want to ride this thing, long and hard. We have to keep them at a distance. Hello, Captain. I heard you popped by yesterday. - Didn't even come and say hi? - Sorry, man, I, uh... You guys looking after Archie for me? It's us that need looking after, you must see the man's latest squeeze, Cap. A granny from Crawford. I told you, she didn't even look 50. And it's Rondebosch East. Anyway, you back, or what, Cap? No, I... I’m going to have a quick chat with the Chief, okay? See you guys later, okay? You know, your mom never really loved you, huh? Bro, what the hell? Talking about my squeeze looks 50, - you mad? - Hey, hey! Theo, what the hell happened? Car accident. Tobie, please give me a minute. Yeah. One of his neighbors phoned this morning, anonymously. Apparently he heard the woman screaming, around 6:45. Two of our units were sent out to the house. - Where’s the coroner’s report? - We’re still waiting. But she was clearly strangled, it’s asphyxiation. Is that your expert opinion? - General, it’s a slam-dunk case. - It’s a manhunt. Every little mistake we make now leads to another murder. From now on, all leads are to be reported to me directly. You have got to tell me what's going on. I can't help you if you don't tell me what's going on. Trust me... It's better if you don't know. ...the Pretorius street area around ten o'clock this morning. Theo Abrams is considered armed and dangerous. - What did he say? - Wanted in connection with multiple homicides, including four SAPS officers. Anyone with information on the suspect can report to Central or call the SAPS emergency crime hotline. What’s wrong? Wait. What the hell are you doing with a gun, Theo? I... Moses, stop. Moses. Please, stop. What is going on? Someone tried to kill me, Moses. Call that crime hotline. What do you mean, someone tried to kill you? Theo, talk to me, please. Hey! No one needs to know about this. - We can call Angie... - Angie's dead, Moses! She's dead! I had no choice! Let me help you. But first you have to let me have the gun. - No. - Please, give me the gun. I'm... I'm sorry. Hold it there, hold it there, hold it there. Shit. Fuck. Hey! Hey, Moses. Hey, hey. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey. Hang in there, okay? You hang in there. Hey, help is here, help is here, okay? Whoever did this, I'm gonna find them. Okay? I'll see you soon. Are you done? Hey, you. Who are you? Hey, speak. 141 Ferndale Road. 141 Ferndale Road. The station commander is in a critical condition, but he’s alive. This is a massacre, nothing less. We need to catch this guy today, you hear me? Theo Abrams saved 198 people in four years. And another 25 since he became captain. - His colleagues see him as a hero. - So, what are you trying to say? He’s been on mandatory leave for five months, after he lost two of his friends in a fire. And, according to his file, there have been two incidents at his home, apparently domestic disturbance. And his neighbors, they say he’s been aggressive lately. They don’t know him to usually be that way. - All since that specific fire. - What are you getting at? It’s obvious, General. PTSD. That’s why he was on mandatory leave. Perhaps even why he murdered his wife. General, the guys from the fire department. They see the same horrors we do. Probably worse. - How is that relevant? - It is relevant, because they have to power through. Because the public relies on them, just like the police. General, here it is, black on white. We can use it to expose this cycle of trauma. Perhaps put systems in place to ensure... No one gives a wit about PTSD. You should know that. The public expects the police to protect them. They don’t want to know that we can’t even protect ourselves. Theo Abrams is not a victim. He’s a murderer and that’s that. I found out who his psychiatrist is. We have to go see her. Maybe she can help us figure out what’s going on in his head. All right, all right, make the appointment. But send out a press release. I want Theo Abrams’ face on every TV news channel, every radio station, on the front page. If he tweets something, I want to know about it. This bastard isn’t going to hide from us. I thought you wanted to keep the media at a distance, General. It’s too late for that. Excuse me, sir, can I help you? Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm actually just visiting a friend, that's all. All guests are required to sign in for security purposes. This way, please. Who are you visiting today, sir? Um... I'm, uh, I... - Uh... - Sir? Ma'am, put down the phone. Uh, Sir, I have to call the staff you're visiting so that he or she can come fetch you, we don't allow visitors in unattended. - Security... - Okay. Put down the phone, now. So, in every way that this ends badly for me, it ends badly for you, do you understand? Good. Now... The security control room. Take me there. Now. Fourteen hours ago, okay. Black BMW. Damn it. Okay. Where's that? Service entrance. There are hallway cameras. Okay. You clever bastard. This feed's on a loop. These timecodes don't add up. Okay. Okay. I need a list of every person living on the 16th floor for the last week. Okay? Can you get me that list? Yes? Or this ends badly for him. No, no, please, okay, it's fine, I'll go. But, um... I need to get it from the front desk. You have two minutes, okay? Two minutes. And bring a master key with you, you understand? - Okay? Go, go, go. - Okay. I have great appreciation and understanding for you, Doctor... as a volunteer who does so much good work with people in the public service. Your work is highly regarded, - but... - But some people don’t believe in the process. Do you know how many times I’ve seen it happen? I’ve lost friends, good friends. And the problem wasn’t a lack of support, or systems, or trauma counselling. The problem was pride. Who wants to be seen as a weakling? And here we have Theo Abrams now. How many more people need to die for his pride? He’s had opportunities for counselling, yes? And he refused. - Correct? - Trauma isn’t rational, General. And you’re confusing pride with shame or fear. I understand there’s much at stake, but... But the bodies are piling up. No one wants another death. Just help us find Theo. You want me to discuss a patient. It's... it’s not only unethical, it’s illegal. And if your patient kills 15 people in cold blood? Confidentiality is nonnegotiable. Captain, you were in this chair yourself, only recently. How would you feel if I told a stranger your deepest, most painful secrets? With all due respect, Doctor, Rene didn’t kill 15 people today. - Give me the key. - Give me the key. You... It's okay, don't worry. Hey, it's okay, don't worry. - No... no, please. - Get in, get in. Get in. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. It's okay, it's okay. Okay. Shit. - Yes? - Uh, sorry. - What’s his name? - Samuel Isaacs. He worked for M-Tech a long time ago. I got a call this morning. Saying your life is in danger. Authorities are still searching for Theo Abrams, a fire fighter from Cape Town. Abrams leaves behind a trail of carnage that started with the gruesome murder of his wife, the respected journalist, Angela Abrams. Four police officers and nine firefighters... Sam thinks it’s linked to a program at M-Tech. Something to do with assassinations. Where’s the laptop? Where’s the laptop? Who the fuck are you? Who? Who the fuck are you? Was it you who killed my wife and tried to frame me? Do you work for M-Tech? Thought so, stupid bitch. I’m going to find out who’s responsible for this. Then you’re all going to pay. Take the stairs. Out the way, get out of the way. It wasn’t me. The whole thing is a setup, someone’s trying to frame me. It doesn’t seem that way to me. But let’s assume you’re telling the truth. Put down that weapon, then you explain it to me. Mr. Abrams, please. Too many people have already died today. It can end now, if you help me. Your choice. Theo. We met at your house. I just want to tell you something. My husband shot at my daughter and I. He wanted to kill us. But he only managed that with one person, himself. And I know. I know he’s in a better place. And that he regrets what he did. He was a good man. He just couldn’t protect himself from himself. But you, Theo, you can protect Wesley. All he wants is his dad. And if you try to flee again, it can only end one way. What becomes of your son then? Theo, please. Don’t make an orphan of him. You know all too well how that feels. Open the door! You can’t get away, open up. Theo, open up! Bastard. Fuck. Could we get anything from the CCTV? All the cameras stopped working at once. A system failure, apparently. That’s convenient. Well, at least no video of us will end up on social media. Yes, and the guy in the elevator, the injured one. Did he have anything to say? He has four broken ribs and a stab wound in his leg. According to him, Abrams just attacked him. - What about this guy? - Dead as a doornail for 12 hours already. The first thing Abrams said was that someone is trying to frame him. That means he came here looking for something. Proof. We have to find out who this guy is. That might tell us what Abrams is looking for. Williamson. Hmm? Go home. What? Why? You placed yourself and a senior officer in danger. There in the hallway earlier with Abrams. You weren’t focused on the case, only your own agenda. I’m taking you off the case, effective immediately. General, that’s absolute bullshit. I have the best chance of anyone to solve this case. Or fuck it up. Sussex Industries. Relax, Captain. I want to help you. Theo Abrams. Only survivor. "Believes himself to be responsible for his parents' deaths." Mm-hmm. "Displays extraordinary resilience to childhood trauma." - Come on, let me see. - Leave it. Leave it. I never liked that mirror. It’s always been a pain in my butt. How would I ever survive without you? You’re a survivor, T. That’s what you do. Since long before you met me. - What the fuck? - Samuel Isaacs. The corpse at the hotel. I ran his fingerprints myself. The guy is a freaking ghost. This is literally all we have on him. I really hope I drew the wrong conclusions about you. Sit. Where are we? FRS picked him up on one of the street cameras. - I’m on my way. - We’re too close to the end, Ernst. Finish this thing now, I don’t care how you do it. Colonel Marquez, thank you for meeting me at this hour. You don't have to thank me yet, Minister. I don't know why I'm here. Well, I'll get straight to the point. After your president's untimely death, China began lobbying hard to ensure your vice-president becomes the country's successor. His loyalty to the East is no secret. With him in power, it will ensure their military stronghold in the region for decades to come. But we have the opportunity to ensure that doesn't happen. You're the strongest opposition leader in Angola, so my question to you, Colonel, is, do you want to be the next president? African Union Summit stalls... My name is Samuel Isaacs, and this testimony relates to an ongoing investigation into M-Tech, an experimental program, known as Indemnity, and its creator, South Africa's Minister of Defense. You don't have that kind of power. What if I did? What if, together, we and others like us - can take back this continent? - How? Back in 1996, I was tasked with testing the psychical effects of advanced psychoplasma drugs on volunteers, mostly men and some women from the military. Guinea pigs for experimental procedures that would supposedly advance treatment of extreme post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Shock therapy, coercion, cognitive manipulation techniques were routinely demonstrated on South African citizens to study the body's response to trauma using powerful serums. But what I later discovered was that the program wasn't designed to treat PTSD, but to manipulate it. To use it to create unwitting soldiers who would obediently take the fall for crimes they didn't commit, by forcibly rehabilitating their memories with powerful medication. The program was tested in various African countries where M-Tech had set up training facilities, a front for secret military outposts. Outposts that were a cover for the planning of, and systematic elimination of powerful political leaders on the continent, who all had one thing in common, interests that weren't aligned to the politics of David Gordon. We traced Samuel Isaacs’ tax number. His last official salary came through 14 years ago. He did freelance investigative work for us for about two years, from 2004. We do a thorough background check on everyone. Company policy. - This guy was part of Special Forces. - That’s why we hired him. Our best investigators are guys with military experience. Makes them ten times better than the rest, if you ask me. Can you remember if he ever mentioned a Theo Abrams? He didn’t say much. Never asked questions. So we didn’t either. Until he disappeared in 2006. Vanished off the face of the Earth, it seems. Back when I began leaking intel to the press, M-Tech was investigated. It didn't take long for some staff to defect or turn state's witness. But I knew better. I resigned quietly, went off the grid. And today, I'm the only witness still alive, but I needed help, I needed proof of this conspiracy. Mikaela Morris helped with that. She was an expert at information retrieval. She found that M-Tech had infiltrated the highest levels of African governments. David Gordon has murdered countless African leaders and framed unwitting suspects using this illegal, experimental programme, which itself is a violation of the Geneva Convention. The question we need to ask ourselves is, to what end? You made me work for my pay today, hey? But that’s okay, that’s okay, I actually enjoyed it. Now I’m going to kill you. Get the car, I need to get to M-Tech. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Kill me. - No. - Kill me. - No. Please. Please, kill me. Theo, please. What exactly do I need to do? Keep the phone, It will ring when the time is right. Did you hear? Moses Tweste passed away in the middle of the night. Yes, it’s awful. Just yesterday, the doctors were telling me he’s recovering well. I was hoping to see him today. So yes. Look here. This is the hospital, close to the ward where his bed was. The cameras stopped working. Sounds familiar, hey? But this hospital has another generator on a different site for things like ICU, so the CCTV kept working. Now, only staff and family members are allowed in here, no one else. Fucking hell. Is that the guy from the hotel elevator? - Did he murder Tweste? - Possibly. Come again. Yes. Not registered? Okay, thanks. The guy’s cell number is fake. His address, too. It’s all bullshit. He’s the only one we haven’t identified yet. Am I right? I think I’m going to vote for him, this one, this Gordon guy. I think he’d make a good president, even though he’s a White guy. Tell me. How soon after your husband’s death did you return to work? Three miserable, unpaid weeks. Because it was suicide, life insurance meant nothing. He took everything from you and left you with nothing. You’re trying to bribe a detective. I should lock you up. You’re welcome to, if you’re that determined to keep losing. Wait. Yes? I have a new lead. Come on. I... I need to fetch my daughter from home. Or school rather and drop her off at home. I’ll phone as soon as I’m done. Theo. The internet is an amazing thing, Doc. If you search hard enough, you can find anything. Like, for example... who developed Torvidep? The medication that’s supposed to correct PTSD patients’ chemical imbalances? Advanced psychoplasma drugs. And you were a resident with Avark Pharmaceuticals. But that name didn’t last long. M-Tech bought out the company. Then it became Rotterscope International. And they’re the ones... who made these pills. Yes. And you helped kickstart the Sancore Foundation. And Rotterscope is your biggest investor. But the foundation helped offer psychological care to members of the navy, the army, police... and firefighters. And that’s how you got access to everyone. Which computer? You gave me the pills. You messed with my head. You sent someone to my house to kill my wife and made me believe it was me. But how? How is it possible that I can’t remember anything? But I figured it out, Doc. It’s the pills and your hypnosis. That’s how you make us forget. Turn us into unreliable witnesses. Yes. And that’s the key that was just out of Samuel’s reach. There are 400 names on that list. And let me guess, they all got some of these pills. Yes. And they all received the same hypnosis therapy as me. Ready to be framed, or killed, or whatever David Gordon needs that day. But that’s... that’s what Indemnity is, isn’t it? Yes. Sancore’s founding statement. Beautifully worded by you-know-who, David Gordon. But there’s only one thing I can’t figure out. Angie started digging around two days ago. So when did you program me? Was it during all of our sessions? So that you can use me the day you need me? Well, you have two options, Doc. Either you tell me what you did to me and why. Or everything comes to an end for you, right now. Hi, it's Detective Williamson, please leave a message. This is a post-hypnotic triggering mechanism. It synchronizes with the electrical currents in your brain to take over. All I need to do is press this button and you’re activated. What do you mean, activated? You were programmed to kill your wife, Theo. What? Why? That’s not why we originally selected you for the program... but she started digging in the wrong places. She forced us to move things along more quickly. - You’re messing with my head. - That’s how the program works. People become weapons. Theo, you are Indemnity. The hypnosis by itself wasn’t sufficient. That’s why we created Torvidep. It makes the patient more receptive to instructions. Listen closely. The instructions speak to the primal components of the brain. And it works because it connects to instincts that are already there. No matter how you look at it, it’s still your hands that strangled your wife. You’re here because you’re looking for redemption, something to free you from that burden of guilt. But I can’t give it to you. You think I’m mad. To be able to program a person in this way isn’t madness, it’s brilliant, it’s innovative, the future of warfare. I could use your pain, your trauma, because you allowed it. You made yourself the ideal candidate. You’re looking for proof that you’re innocent, but that’s the one thing you’ll never find. That’s what makes my process perfect. If Angela had published her story, it would have destroyed this country. There’s honor in what you did. A higher purpose. This program, believe me, it’s our big chance to change the world. Why are you telling me all this? You have about 30 seconds to decide. Either you can keep your trap shut about everything you just heard or soon you can visit your son in the morgue. I’ll kill you. Then you’re also killing Wesley. That I can guarantee. They might ask questions you don’t want to answer. You think that I’ll let you get away with this? - After everything you’ve done to me? - Abrams... leave her alone. Abrams, stand back. Don’t shoot. On your knees and put down the weapon. Williamson, wait, wait, wait. Mr. Abrams, you said there’s a conspiracy, false evidence against you. Please, I want to hear your side of the story. Is there a reason you don’t want to talk to me? Look, you can trust us. I’m guilty. I did it. Come on. Excuse me, guys. Thank you. What happened here? Why was he here with you? My guess? He was looking for help. Therapy. After everything he’s caused. Please drop my car off at the station, thank you. How did you get here so quickly? I... I happened to be around the corner when the alert came through. The Commissioner wants us back at the station for a press conference. She wants us to capitalize on the arrest. As soon as possible. You should do it. You deserve it, you’re a good detective. You’re the future. I’m retiring. That stuff you said about your daughter is true, isn’t it? Then you’ll understand, the only thing that matters to me now is Wesley. And he doesn’t have anything to do with this. - Where’s his son? Where’s Wesley? - That’s none of your business. No, wait, you said he’d be safe. Hey! What do I tell my superiors and the media? You’re clever, you’ll think of something. Listen, please, you can do what you want with me, but leave Wesley out of this. Please, he’s my child. Stop whining, he won’t know what it’s like being an orphan for very long. Get up and run. Sorry, Wesley. Give me your gun. Give me your gun. Was it you who gave Wesley to them? Is that why you helped me just now? So I’m only going to ask you this once. What did you do with my son? Tell me now, or I swear I’ll blow your brains out. M-Tech. He’s at M-Tech. Get in. Theo, please. I can help you get him out. You can’t go in there alone, that’s just crazy. Theo! Luckily for you, I’m already crazy. - Wake him up. - Sir? I said, wake him up. Mr. Abrams. It seems like the two of us were destined to meet today. Where’s my son? You need to stop this lone wolf in the eleventh-hour bullshit. This thing certainly isn’t going to end the way you want it to. But I know men like you. You hide behind patriotism. But the truth will always come to light. You know absolutely nothing about men like me. You use trauma, innocent people’s pain, as weapons. This situation is a bit larger than the loss you... What’s the point, you wouldn’t understand. I know you have an agenda. You kill people all across Africa. And I don’t care what the reasons are, all I want is my child. Take him to the laboratory. Where’s Wesley? You’ll see him again soon, Mr. Abrams. What do you want? In a word, freedom. The Chinese and the Americans have stolen Africa’s most valuable resources, taken over our economies and run our democracies for their own benefit. Not anymore. I’m going to take back what’s ours. So you want to start a war? Kill millions of people. Perhaps. But Africa is finally united. Thanks to my weapons. If it takes a war to get the colonial powers off our continent, then that is what will happen. Please, you don’t care about the people of Africa. All you want is power. So show us what your true motives are. You almost threw a spanner in the works, Mr. Abrams. But in the end you were quite useful. We are very close to the finish line, thanks to you shutting up your wife. We are very grateful to you. So I’m going to do you a favor. Your own hands will determine what happens next. Will you prepare, Doctor? His son, Wesley. No. No, no, no, no! No! Do it or must I take over? I’m going to kill you. - Let me know when you’re done. - I’m going to fucking kill you! No! Please, please, you don’t need to do this, please. Please! Shit. Think very carefully about what your next move is going to be. Okay? Where is he? Where’s Wesley? I trusted you, Doc. And you turned me into a murderer. So what’s happening to you now is your own fault. Where’s Wesley? The western corridor. Substation three. Wesley! Wesley! Wesley! Wes! Wesley! Wesley! Wesley! No! Wesley! No! Wesley! Stand back, Wesley. Stand back, Wesley. Wesley? I’ve got you. Daddy? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy? Daddy! Daddy! Dad! The horrors that have come to light about M-Tech's gross abuse of power left all of us traumatised. But justice will prevail. As we look at fixing the missteps of government, we must usher in a time for healing, in memory of those countless lives lost, by those who were simply misguided. Thank you. That was a mere two hours before Minister of Defense, David Gordon, was implicated on charges of terrorism, racketeering, murder, and conspiracy, in connection with the breaking M-Tech investigation that sent shockwaves around the world. How are you holding up? I’m doing everything to get you out of here. But it’s going to take a few more days. It’s a unique case, to say the least. What does it matter? It doesn’t. You’re a brave man, Theo. You’re stronger than just about anyone I’ve ever worked with. But you’re punishing yourself unnecessarily, for something that’s not your fault. You have to learn to forgive yourself, no one will do it for you. Otherwise you’ll end up a bitter old man with only regret for company. You say it doesn’t matter. Tell him that. Daddy, when are you coming home? One of these days, okay? - I promise. - Good. We need to talk business. Hi. My name is Theo Abrams.
