Domashniy TV Channel Star Media presents Tatyana Cherkasova, Ilya Noskov Boris Mironov, Yulia Kokryatskaya, Victoria Poltorak ROSE OF FAREWELL WINDS based on a novel by Tatyana Tronina The Rose of the Farewell Winds Created by Maria Vaksman and Alan Khurumov Directed by Dmitry Sorokin Hello! Director of Photography - Vyacheslav Krasakov Music by Vadim Yefimov Yes, Kira. Thank you. Thank you for the greetings. I'll tell that to Kolya. No, he hasn't come yet. He is a bit late. I don't know. He must have gone to buy the flowers. It’s our 15-year wedding anniversary, after all! He can't leave me without a bouquet. General Producers - Natalia Bilan and Vlad Ryashin It’s better this way. Your hands are so tender. A bit higher, please, a bit higher. Yes, yes, yes! Rose! He has come. Bye! Rose, we have visitors. This is Peter from Germany. He came here for a symposium on human rights. Hello. I'm Rose. I speak Russian. Nice to meet you. How was your flight? The flight was excellent. We landed on the second attempt, though. But... Moscow! What a windy city! He is pretending to be a foreigner but in reality he is our compatriot. Petya from Ryazan! Here you go. Hello, Rose Vitalyevna. Good evening, Georgiy. It smells so good! You work miracles! How did you get to know that we'll have visitors? Will you sit with us? No. I still have some homeworks to correct. I'll go to the summer cottage this evening. I need to water flowers. Have fun! Kira, hello, this is Kostya. Hello! You're disappearing somewhere. Hello? Kira, look, I have a request for you. "May I spend a night at your place? Nothing has happened; " I just want to spend some time alone. What are you doing in Sochi? Oh, the festival! Very good. What do I do? Where should I go? To the summer cottage? A summer cottage is a good thing, it'll suit me. You rented it together with Rose, didn’t you? All right, tell me the address, I'll put it down. Hey! What are you doing here? I'm looking for a key. What key? A spare one. I'll call the neighbors now. No need to call the neighbors. I've found it. What are you doing here? I know you. You're Rose. Kostya? I'm sorry. I called Kira and asked her to... I needed a place to spend the night. She let me stay here. It's all right. It looks like my crazy friend - to call her former husband to a summer cottage without even warning me. You changed. You used to be a redhead and now... The redhead is gone. So... don't smoke. I don’t smoke. Don't make any noise. I hope I have nothing to fear about. What do you mean? I hope you won't get any thoughts concerning me. Oh, this... No, no. Everything will be fine. Good night. “I hope you won't get any thoughts concerning me”. Who needs you apart from your own husband? What did you do? I asked you not to make noise. I just wanted to drink some tea. I'm thirsty. You won't be able to boil the water in this one. It’s broken. I have no time to buy a new one and I’m too greedy to throw the old one away. I'll clean it. Thank you, kind woman. I'm sorry for bringing you so much trouble. It’s all right. I can’t sleep anyway. Tell me, how did you come to such life? Kira should have warned me, though. She invited you but said nothing to me. She forgot. You know what her life is like. Meetings, discussions, a war with that... Gantelin... Gireyev. Yes, that critic... When did you last see Ivan? Recently. He grew up so much. He is so tall and lean now... despite his 11 years. 12. Yes, he is almost 12. Kira told me he already has a girlfriend. Are you going to marry yourself? I see. What about your work? Are you designing aircrafts? You used to study in the Aviation Construction Institute when you and Kira were married. I don't design planes, Rose. I work for a firm that washes them. You dreamt of designing them, didn't you? Life changed. I got an offer and I couldn't refuse it. How did you end up here? Looking like this? Has something happened? Nothing. I dropped in the bar, started to drink. Then I drank too much. Everything is fine. Wait. Why are you here? This summer cottage is Kira’s. We rented it for two families. Wait. Why are you here alone, without your husband? You are married, aren't you? I am. He got delayed at work. Who is he? He is a lawyer. He has lots of work. He defends everybody, helps everybody, sympathizes with everybody… What about you? What about me? I have my pupils, the school, their homework. Such crazy days... Yes, but... you like it, don't you? You always loved children. Right. Where have you been? I called all our friends, all the morgues, all the hospitals! I'm sorry. Do you remember the Kolganovs? They started the move and asked me to help them. I helped them, and later... You know. Why didn't you answer your phone? I almost got mad from worrying! My phone got discharged. I never forget to charge it but... It just happened so. Forgive me, please. A drunk! One can't even quarrel with you! All right... Take a shower! You smell like a trump! How is the summer cottage? Everything is fine. Shall I make you some coffee? No, thank you. Maybe tea? I don't want anything. Tell me, how was your morning? It was all right. I got a call from a radio station. I refused them. Why? They are weird guys. I was there once. They didn't give me the opportunity to talk. The host was interrupting me all the time. He was clearly in love with himself. It was a bad program. Look, I have a terrible headache. I don't want to listen to that nonsense. Take some aspirin. You asked me to tell you about it yourself. You're right. I'm sorry. I have a headache. What were you doing yesterday? Nothing. I was sitting at home taking pills. Then Kurakin dropped in. And? Nothing. He spent some time with me. Are you jealous? How can you? How can you be jealous of Kurakin? He is... He is a poet. Lermontov was a poet too. But it didn’t present a cheated husband from killing him at a duel. Stop! Don't you dare kill Kurakin. He won't take it well. Besides he is very good. When he got to know that I fell ill he sat with me all the evening, brewed me tea, told me about physiognomy and even showed how one can determine one's roots by the face traits. Look, I didn’t know that you were such Othello! Liza, marry me! Will they stand for long? For two weeks at least. Oh, sure! Two days at most. You don't give any guarantees and one can say anything. If they wither fast you're in for a trouble, Yes? I'm opening. Valya, get ready. Mum, I haven't finished! You'll finish that at your granny. Hi, beauty. All boys will you yours with such hair. This is what I tell her, and she wants to do a haircut. Don't you dare, do you get it? Valya, why don't you say hello to Uncle Kolya? Hello. Hello! Go! Granny is waiting for you. My Nefertiti. Thank you, my pharaoh. Nevolin, look how beautiful it is! Yes, it is beautiful. But it's good for a melodrama, for a movie. It's too much for real life. You know, I got an invitation from the Design Bureau of Sobolev. You know that I always dreamt about designing planes. That idea again? We’re going to marry. We shall somehow get our life in order. We wanted to buy a larger apartment. You dreamt of an home office, didn't you? I still dream about it. Do you remember how we met? Of course. Dad was conducting negotiations. And then you appeared. You were so funny. You offered to dedicate a plane to me. You must have thought that you were irresistible. Such a romantic lover... Yes. I used to be funny indeed. A real madman. I was obsessed with an idea to construct a new kind of plane, to design airliners. Who am I now? I'm a plane-cleaner. Nevolin, you're not a cleaner. You don't stand there with a hose, do you? You're working for a respected company that washes planes. You’re not just any employer. You’re the owner's right hand. Really! You may change your job any time. But let’s marry first, go for the honeymoon and think about that later! Yes, Kira. What has happened? Kira, I had some plans for today. Meet him yourself. All right, I'll bring him to you. Bye. What can I do? What? We wanted to spend the weekend together, didn't we? We did. What if we go to look for a dress all together – me, you and Ivan? How do you like this idea? Will we look for the shoes too? Of course! Do you know that you're very handsome? You have eyes of most incredible color. You’re flattering me. Your eyes are incredible. Like the eyes of an Egyptian's princess's. What color are your wife’s eyes? They are grey. You found great time to talk about my wife's eyes. I'm sorry. I want to know whom I'm sharing my man with. Do you love her? Yes, very much. What a bad manner to ask silly questions and then to get hurt at the answers! She is a great person and a very good friend. Again? This is a very good variant. Do you remember Svetlov? He is the director of a radio station and he needs an assistant. This is a very good job, really. I like my job. What kind of job is that - to flirt with the passengers? What are you doing during your flights? You're jealous, aren't you? Do as we agreed. When you leave Rose I'll leave my job and be with you all the time. You know I can't leave her. I can't. We have been together for 15 years. She won't live without me. And I won't live with you. What do you need that for? You could live on your own. It's good to be on your own... for a year or two. And after this time one wants to die because of being alone. Why don't you like Liza? She is good. She is kind and reliable. When you were marrying mum did you say that she was kind and reliable too? I still think so. It’s just that... we didn't manage to live under one roof. You only lived together for a year and a bit. You have lived with this girl longer. Stop talking about Liza in this way! She has no connection to the problems between your mum and me. I'm an adult. I have a right to have private life and... a bit of respect. How do you like it? Wow! You're the most beautiful bride in the world! This is true! Vanya, tell her! I think this dress makes you look fatter. It's not a fault of a dress, though… Go to the car and wait for me there. Go, go! I told you to go! Look, don't get hurt. He is just a boy and he has no sense of humor. Let me take him home and get back to you. I'll go with you. What for? You'll quarrel again. Stop talking nonsense! He is teasing me all the time. I treat him well, by the way. Plus it doesn't matter whether your son likes that or not, but I'll become your wife all the same. So he'll have to communicate with me. What do you have to go with us for? Let me take him there and go back. I love riding! I'll stay in the car. Look, I don't understand. Are you afraid of showing me to your ex? Maybe you're shy of me? Liza, eat salad. It’s our house specialty, cooked in accordance with the granny's recipe. It was the first dish that I learned to cook. Kostya's mum taught me. By the way, Kostya likes it very much. Kostya is not very choosy. How weird! He used to pick at his plate for ages. The years of bachelor life must have influenced him. What are you doing in life, Liza? I'm a freelancer. I write articles on fashion, on modern trends... Rose, sorry for intruding. It's all right. Go, or they'll notice your absence. They won't. They are trying to outtalk each other. Rose, I wanted to tell you... Say nothing. Consider that nothing has happened. I can't stop thinking about you. You’re saying - the West, European education, European cinema... Gireyev... do you know Gireyev? He is a famous critic. He is bowing to the West as if we had no Eisenstein, Romm, Tarkovskiy, as if we don't know how to make cinema ourselves. Will you ever calm down? Auntie Rose, she'll never calm down. Don't interfere in adults' talk! And stop snatching bites! Take a piece, sit down and eat properly! You became absolutely uncontrollable, Ivan! What was I talking about? About the West. I don't know about the movies but the West is very good at making clothes. Let’s stop talking about the art, girls. Let’s talk about the meat. I don't know. It seems to me that they’re poisoning us with their ideology. You have a real banquet here! Kolya, you came right in time. Kostya made great meat for us. Sit down. I'll bring you a plate. Nicolay. Konstantin. This is Liza, my fiancee. Hello. Kira. Hi. What are we going to drink? You're saying that you have been living with my husband for a long time. But it is physically impossible. Why? Do you doubt your husband's abilities? I didn't mean that. But Kolya is busy all the time. He has endless symposiums and business trips. And in the evenings he is always at home. Women's shortsightedness never seems to amaze me. Shall I remind you all his business trips? Why are you saying that to me? We have a good family. Rose, stop it. You don't even have children. What kind of family is that? Kolya and I love each other. He feels sorry for you. Frankly speaking, a man like Kolya needs a bright woman. Like you? He doesn't need a housewife for sure. I'm not a housewife. Yes, you're teaching from time to time. Kolya is not interested in you. Do you remember him leaving for negotiations in February? I was with him. Look. This photo was taken when we were in Italy. He told you that he was going to a symposium. Do you want to see some more? I have photos from Spain and England. We went there with Valya. What Valya? Valya is my daughter. Kolya loves her very much. Rose, dear, don't stand in the way of our happiness. Let him go! Hi. Hi. Are you going somewhere? Yes, I'm leaving. Where to? Nowhere. I'm leaving you. Can you explain what is going on? Nothing is going on. Marina came. What Marina? You know what Marina. Will you deny it? No, I won't. Rose, forgive me, I did wrong. You see, I work so much... I don't want to understand anything. I'll correct my mistake. It was just an infatuation… Infatuation? You were living with her behind my back. She showed me the photos. How could you, Kolya? I wasted half of my life on your comforts. I was cooking soups for you and ironing your expensive shirts. I forgot about myself for your sake. Do you know something? I wasn't doing nothing all these years. Do you know how hard it is to perform well in courts? All right, I made a mistake. Yes. But you can give me another chance, can't you? No. I owe you nothing. Have you forgotten about how we used to live after the wedding? We could hardly make the ends meet, but all this time I was by your side. Though I could have left you. I was beautiful then. You don't remember it now. Now you're handsome and successful and I'm just a pitiful housewife. You're defending everybody, Kolya. Who will defend me? Why? What should one defend you from? From loneliness. And from your terrible indifference. It is not indifference, Rose. Please understand. Sometimes one has to hide, to escape the usual world... You’re free. You may go to that world forever. What shall I do? Forgive me! What else shall I do? You've always been a loyal friend to me. This is right. I used to be your loyal friend. A loyal friend, a cleaner, a personal secretary – anybody except for a woman. You forgot that I am a woman, Kolya. You forgot about that to the point that I forgot about that myself. Rose! I understand the situation with the Aeroflot. But it's an interesting case with the Siberia. We shall negotiate it. Hand this case over to Sergey. He is a smart guy, he'll sort it out. You know, I'll work on it myself. I don't get it. This is your last week here. I wanted to tell you that I changed my mind about leaving. What do you mean - you changed you mind? You dreamt of designing planes, didn't you? I thought that... Liza and I are going to marry and to have kids. A dream is a good thing, of course but... this is not the right time. Kostya, when will the time be right? When you retire? I think it's not your idea but Liza's. These are her words, am I right? Alexei Ivanovitch, I've thought it over well. I shall go. Sit down! Sit down! Why did I hire you? What do you think? Do you think I did it because you're my daughter’s boyfriend? If I hired all her admirers I'd have gone bankrupt long ago. I hired you because you're like me, just 20 years younger. I dreamt to design planes too. It didn't happen. First it was hard to enter the faculty, then... the Soviet Union collapsed and the industry went down with it. They paid kopeks in the Research Institutes. Liza's mother persuaded me that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush. Maybe she was right. You have a prosperous company. The sphere of activities is the same. Yes. But I still feel bad because I didn't try it. Kostya, I know my Liza. I love her. I worry whether you'll love her in ten years, when you realize that you buried your dream because of her. Mum, may I go to Yulya? You better do the dishes. You’re so lazy! Why are you like this the second day in a row? Like what? Like this. Will you explain? What is there to be explained? I don't understand it. What did you want to achieve? What right did you have to interfere in my private life? What rights do I have? You’re treating me like your favorite toy. Don't you see what I really want? Hello, Uncle Kolya. Valya, you wanted to visit Yulya, didn't you? Honey, we have already discussed it one hundred times. So what? You're saying that you feel sorry for your wife. Who will feel sorry for me? You're jealous of me. You won't let me go anywhere without you. How many years shall I wait for you? Five? Ten? Fifteen? Your color was not beautiful. The tone was a bit... unpleasant. No, I didn't do anything radical. I just added some color and volume. It’s good now, it seems to me. Right? Let me tell you how to make a hairdo. Look, spray some conditioner on the wet hair, massage it with your hands and... Yes, yes. I remember everything well. I'll get my suit at seven. No, no. I'll take the invitations from the printing house. Yes. And go for the suit at 8. Yes. Yes, yes. I remember. Kisses. Bye. Look, I don't know if she agrees but... My friends are looking for a private English teacher. I thought about Rose. Give me her phone number please. One second. Hello. Hello. You're very beautiful. Stop it! People are watching. Let them watch. Did you want to say something? Yes. Yes. I designed the wings. You see, I designed new wings. Yes, but wings have been invented long ago. No, no, these are my wings. They are the wings of my future aircraft. They are beautiful. Why do they face the opposite direction? They are sweepforward. They optimize the pressure distribution. It’s simple though it is rather difficult to explain. I'd drink some coffee. You see, you're doing well. It’s not very difficult. It’s a bit like dancing. Do you like dancing? I can't dance. Really? I'll teach you. We'll regret it, won't we? We won't. You have a fiancee. And you have a husband. I have a husband. Plus I'm older than you. For two years? For five. You’re lying. You’re so beautiful! And one more thing. I know nothing about you, Nevolin. What do you want to know about me? I want to know everything about you. I'm your friend's ex-husband. I'm an aviation designer who is currently washing planes. Why are you washing them? You dreamt of designing them. I got an invitation but... I refused. Why? The time hasn't come. When will the time come? When you retire? You know, one very clever person said the same to me. It means I'm very clever. Rose? Who is it? Kira. I forgot that she was to come. Rose! Move it! Damn it! Rose! Why didn't you open at once? I fell asleep, can you imagine? I understand. After all that... What do you mean? Stop playing up, Rose. I know everything. Kira, do you know about me and... Yes. How did you get to know? He told me himself. He called and told me. He was crying too. I think you should have told me about that at once. Do you think I would defend that bastard? Why is he a bastard? One could see at once that he is a stud. Really? Is that true? Of course it is true! So you're not mad at me, are you? Why would I get mad at you? He is not my relative! I don't want to see that womanizer! My poor girl! How did you live with him? With whom? With Kostya. With Kostya? With what Kostya? Nevolin. Nevolin? What does Nevolin have to do with it? You said yourself that he was a bastard. Who? Nevolin. I was talking about Nicolay and you! What does Nevolin have to do with it? I don't understand! Kira, thank you. I needed your support very much. Right. What is there? The cats, I think. Nevolin is a real angel. He is so pedantic! When he was leaving home he was already running back! Guys, how are you? Is everything all right? Very good. We're starting in 15 minutes. The performance is about to begin. I feel very uncomfortable, but I still don't know what a performance is. Oh, God! I'm going to marry a savage. Listen to me attentively. A performance is an artistic action in which the artist is using his body to... Wait, wait! Will Kurakin perform a striptease now? Nevolin, you're incredible! The dawn. Insomnia, you won. You have been taking me along dark and empty corridors all the night through. Insomnia, open the door for me. The beast will wail feeling the dawn... Lyusya Chigis. She is a very talented artist. Look, why are they crawling there? They are drawing something. What are they playing? A beast that feels the arrival of dawn or the insomnia itself? Find the solution, oh, man, find the solution! Find a question and guess an answer! I'm ready to serve you too, to tell fortunes with my dry jealous lips! It's great, isn't it? Robert is a genius, after all! Do you like it? It's all right. But I don't understand what Mandelshtam has to do with it. What Mandelshtam? Osip Emilyevitch. The Russian… I mean the Soviet poet. He wrote these lines: "I'm ready to serve you as well". I don't know. It must have been the idea. What's the matter? It's hard to satisfy you. You're a real wild man! Your Kurakin is a plagiarist. Bravo! Confess that you understand nothing in art. I confess. But your Kurakin is still a plagiarist. He should have taken something simpler. And he took a Mandelshtam’s poem! Try to understand that Mandelshtam is a form. And Kurakin is a... content. Really? Yes. This is the only case when a form is more interesting than the content. You're a real savage indeed. A word can't satisfy my thirty lips. Without you the air is empty for me again. God, you should have asked me to marry you earlier. Dresses shaped like bells are in fashion now. But they don't become me at all. I have an idea, though. What if I have a trousers suit instead of a dress? I could decorate it with nice fabric and add a hat! Yes, maybe. Liza... I'm a bastard, a real brat. You'll be right not to forgive me. I've already forgiven you, Nevolin. Liza, I... I can't marry you. Stop it! Did you get hurt that I called you a savage? It was a joke! Do you have another woman? Who is she? She is married. She will never leave her husband. It doesn't matter. I was not talking about that. Wait. What about our wedding? Liza, I won't be able to make your happy. You see, we're too different. We are not compatible. You're so bright, you like parties. I am thinking about a family and I want to have children. You never wanted children. You never offered me to have kids. I'll want them with time. No, Liza. This is it. You see, it’s some infatuation but... I'm thinking about her all the time. I love her. Rose... Kostya. Kostya... I've been waiting for you. I left my fiancee. I left my husband too. Wait. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to spoil your life. It's beautiful, isn't it? Do you know what I found out? I have no friends. Can you imagine that? I have been defending people all my life. But I have no friends. At all. Are you my friend? Right, you're not. Where are my friends? Take Rose. She is not my friend anymore. Do you remember Rose, Gosha? She is not my friend anymore. What will you say about that? I'll say that you're a big boss, Nicolay Sergeyevitch. Well... I'm a big boss indeed. But where are my friends? I have no friends too. But you have a brilliant mind. You'll think of a way to get Rose Vitalyevna back. I will get her back. Why not? Wait for me in the car. I'll come down in some 20 minutes. That’s it. "You had some rest; now it’s time to go home. " Rose, start packing. Where are your things? Let’s go home! Stop playing up! I won't go anywhere. Why? Because I don't want to. What do you want? Do you want me to prostrate at your feet begging to forgive me? No. What do you want, then? I don't want anything. Just leave. Yes, I'm guilty. Rose, I made a mistake. But you're a clever adult woman. You must forgive me. I forgive you. But I won't come back to you. I love you. We've been together for 15 years. How can you just simply break it up? Yes, I had an affair but it’s in the past now. That’s enough. Forgive me and let’s go home. I need you. Kolya, I filed for divorce. What divorce? Are you a fool? I'm a lawyer. I'll leave without any money and the apartment... Moveover, I earned it with my own work. Do I ask for anything from you? What do you hate me for so much? I'm a fool! I have been a real fool not to value you. What shall I do to make you forgive me? What else can I do? "Do you want a baby? Let’s find a surrogate mother; " she'll bear your child. Do you want a girl or a boy? Do you have somebody? Who is he? Do I know him? What difference does it make? A big one! You're my wife! I want to know who is sleeping with my wife! Look, Kolya, let’s not talk about that. You're not in a position to reproach me. I had a little affair that came and went. And you're openly living with somebody! I hate you! You’re behaving like a whore. You wanted to revenge on me, didn't you? You did well. What a whore! How could she? Calm down. Where did I see that jacket? It was on a chair when I last came there. And there was... Kostya! Kira's ex-husband! That scum! This is who she is sleeping with. It was before Marina. What a whore! I wish I found him and... Calm down. Beating him up won't help. I could try it, though. What will I say to him? What can one do in such situation? You can offer him money. You're a genius. I'll give him money. What if he doesn't take it? What if he is a man of principles? It'll be even simpler. Men of principles easily succumb to pity. Let’s go. Where are we going? Home? To Marina. I must talk to her. Valya! Get ready to go to granny. Uncle Kolya will come soon. Mum, may I stay with you? When Uncle Kolya marries me you may stay with us. Get ready. Honey, has something happened? Yes, it has. Rose filed for the divorce. But this is good. This is not all. She has a lover now. It hurts so much. I hope it’s not my ulcer. You drank, didn't you? What did you drink for? The doctors prohibited you! Marina, I didn't come here to listen to your advice. Do you hear what I said? Rose has somebody! So what? I don't understand why it irritates you so much. It's because she is my wife. Men are so predictable. If she begged you to come back you wouldn't even look in her direction. But she decided to be the first to file for the divorce. And she got you mad. Look, you started thinking that you love your Rose only after she filed for the divorce. You don't need her in reality. This is not true. I always loved her. What about me? Who am I for you? Stop it! It’s your fault! You broke my family. You did it yourself. You're losing your close ones because you don't love anybody. This is not true. I love people. I defend them. Do you know how many people I helped? You weren't helping them because you loved them. You're a Narcissus. You love yourself so much that you can't see anything around. You're ready to defend anybody except for your loved ones. I don't understand one thing. I'm a respected man. Half a country knows me. I'm an independent rich man. Why am I listening to some stewardess? You're an independent man, aren't you? Stop lying to yourself! You're a boy other boys didn't want to play with. That’s why you're full of bile. Yes, you grew up, you have an expensive suit and a good car but you're a still a boy from the Soviet past. Rose won't come back to you because you can't love. And one shall love a woman, one shall tell her so. Otherwise she would either stop being a woman or leave for another man. Your Rose went through both stages. First she stopped being a woman and then she left you for another man. By the way, I respect her for that. I hope her new man will be much better. Mum, has Uncle Kolya left? He did. He'll never come back again. Well, princess? Do you still want to cut your hair? Yes! Well... we need to keep the aerodynamic compositions of mutual positioning of main units. We won't change the edging of the wings. We'll change the main part of the fuselage, strengthen the wing, make vertical empennage but without the combs. Air intakes will be here. The boss said that will make the construction heavier than it should be. We shall think it over. We shall think it over. Yes. Who? Nicolay? Yes, I remember. You were in Rose's and Kira's summer cottage. I'm listening. About what? All right. You see, Kostya, Rose and I have been together for 15 years. Yes, Rose told me so. Not everything was all right. But I wouldn't call our marriage a failure. I'll tell you one silly thing but you'll understand me. Are you ready to spend all your life with her? I'm ready. Are you sure? What if you're mistaken? When you were married with Kira, her friend, you must have thought that it would last forever. Am I right? Yes, of course. Do you see? I lived 15 years with her and I'm ready to live twice that time. How long have you been together? Half a year? A year? A month and a half. This is not much. The main thing is for her not to get disappointed in me. But I won't let it happen. We'll have a family. We'll have kids and bring them up. We'll love them. You want to have children, don't you? Yes I do. Then you're in for a problem. Rose can't have children. Didn't she tell you how much time and money we wasted on her treatments? Of course she told me about that. We'll adopt children. You must understand that you're just strangers. You met accidentally and you'll separate eventually. And we have been together for 15 years. If you have strength, leave her. All right, I'll think your words over. Thank you. You have enough pelmenis for a week. You won't stay hungry. Don't get delayed. You're leaving me for an entire week! Honey, don't break my heart. You know that I don't want to go anywhere. Do you want me to stay? I do! I'm staying, then. No, you shall go. What? Eat! I love you very much. I've never loved anybody so much. Be my wife. Nevolin, are you asking me to marry you? Yes, I am. But think it over well. Will you be able to spend the rest of your life with me? I am. Wait. Think it over well. I'm not a present. Really? What's wrong about you? First of all, I was your friend's husband. So what? Bad nature isn't contagious. You might hear that I used to live with one girl, and when it didn't work out I diverted my attention to her girlfriends. I'm all right with that. Is that all what worries you? "I'm not rich; I'm just a common engineer. " And I'm almost 40. What has happened? If you decide to go back to your husband I'll understand. I won't get hurt. Wait. Did you talk to Nicolay? Nevolin, for 15 years I had been married to a right-defender who was extremely good at lying. You're a baby in comparison to him. Did you talk to him? Yes. What did he say? That I won't be able to make you happy. Is that all? More or less. He told you that I can't have children, didn't he? Am I right? He said something like that but I wasn't paying attention. You know that I have Ivan. I don't need more children. I'm a bad father. No, I tried being a father but it didn't work out well. Look, I love you very much. I need you. Fish! Fish, fish... Why is that? I had a dream interpreter here somewhere. So... fish. If a woman sees a fish in her dream it means that she is pregnant. This is impossible. Good bye. Four weeks. When did it happen? Good morning. Come in, Gosha. Good morning. Coffee is on the oven, sandwiches are in the fridge. Here is a newspaper and a letter. What is this? From the court? It must be on Tyurin's case. No, I won't let you have Tyurin, guys. Be present in the court for... The divorce! Damn it! How could she? And that... I'll think your proposition over! Nicolay Sergeyevitch... Let's turn to plan B. Hi, this is me. Is Ivan ready? I've thought of a great program. First the carting and then a cafe. Kira, why are we standing on a threshold? May I come in? What’s wrong? What has happened? Nicolay called me and told about Nevolin and you. This is not true, right? This is true, after all! Kira, I'm sorry, it all happened so fast! What did happen fast? Did you start sleeping with my ex fast? Or did you get used to your husband's unfaithfulness fast and found another man fast? Kira... What? There were 11 mln people in Moscow. Did you need my ex-husband? Kira, this is not so. How is that? You have always been sympathetic with me, but I'm living my own life. Did I ask you about that? Kira, this is not true. I always supported you. Yes, you were supporting me. You were giving me money when I was broke. But you never believed in me. I'm your friend... such an inexplicable and crazy girl! Kira, why are you doing that? Why? I’m the one who should ask “why”! What do you hate me for? Did you need Nevolin? Kira, we have been together for so many years! What are you talking about? Go home. You have no friend anymore. Yes, Liza. Hi, just a moment, I got a call on the second line. Yes? One minute, Nicolay. I have a person waiting on the first line. Yes, Liza. Look, this is not urgent. Live there as long as you want. I’ve just come down from a plane. I’m terribly tired. Let’s do it tomorrow. Tomorrow after dinner. Bye. Yes, Nicolay, I’m listening. Look, Nicolay, I thought your offer over and I won’t leave her. I’ve just come down from the plane. Let’s discuss it over the phone. All right. What did you want to discuss? Any problems with the divorce? There is only one problem. I am not going to divorce. This is your problem. You’ll have too. We’re not living in the Middle Ages when the Church prohibited divorces. Let’s talk openly. I’m a serious man. I know what I want. I have a business offer to you. Wait. Let me talk to the end. Don’t interrupt. Maybe my offer will seem awful to you, but believe me, this is not so. If you agree to my offer you’ll get many new opportunities. You will be able to buy a new suit. A new modern car. Or go abroad, see the world. You’ll have many new impressions… and women. I think I know what you’re talking about. How much? 50,000. Dollars, of course. This is not serious. Not serious? All right, let it be 75,000. But this is all. You’re so greedy! Damn you! One hundred! Consider me a bankrupt. Do you agree? No. Do you want me to tell you a secret? I talked to Rose before our meeting. I offered her to marry me, and she agreed. She couldn’t have agreed. She is still my wife. She is my wife. And I don’t sell wives. Are you teasing me, boy? Will you take the money or not? Go to hell! First! Come here! We have a fight! There you go. They’ll isolate him temporarily. He’ll spend some time away from Rose. It’ll give me time to think of something. And now I need your help. Georgiy, hi. Hello, Rose Vitalyevna. Your husband has problems. What has happened? Nicolay Sergeyevitch is sick. His ulcer must be bleeding. Is he in the hospital? He doesn’t want to go to the hospital. He wants to see you. He says he’ll die if you fail to come. Gosha, I can’t. You know, I really can’t. He’ll die. You know how stubborn he is. All right. Good. I’ll get ready now. What’s the matter, Rose Vitalyevna? What’s wrong? My belly… it hurts. It’s all right. I’ll take you to the hospital. Please find Kostya. Kolya? What is with the baby? He is all right. This is so unfair! We tried to have a baby so many times, and now you conceived from another man. This is useless. I talked to him. He decided to go back to his fiancee. This is not true. This is true. I talked to him. He asked not to call him not to disturb the girl. This baby will be ours. Just ours. I’ll be a very good father. Kolya, I don’t love you anymore. Honey, sometime will pass, and you’ll forget it all. Let’s go home now. Everything will be all right. Here is the taxi. A taxi? Where is Gosha? I don’t know. He disappeared somewhere. Kostya? Kostya! Don’t do it, Nicolay Sergeyevitch. Will you stop me? I will if need be. You better let her go yourself. Can’t you see? It should be so. We’ll have a baby. I know. Are you glad? Or aren’t you? Why do you think so? I’m very glad. You said that you didn’t want to have more children, that Ivan was enough for you. What else could I have told you? That I didn’t need an infertile woman? Kostya, you’re so good! Gosha! Thank you! You’re welcome. Thank you. Be careful, it’s heavy. Really? I didn’t notice. You’re a sportsman, aren’t you? I used to me. Kira! Kira, I’m so glad to see you. Rose! Rose, forgive me, please. I’m such a fool! I had to wish you happiness, and I… It’s all right. Don’t worry. Let’s go. Kira, watch it to the end and then argue. The last movie by Woody Allen is a masterpiece! Gireyev, you’re wrong. I won’t agree with you. Tell me please… First of all, people of our country don’t understand such humor, and secondly… Do you argue about cinema at home too? Stop arguing. Cinema is individual art. Everybody sees something for himself in it. Am I right? Let’s drink! I’ll have a walk. Don’t go too far, Vanya. If you fall in love with a woman for real, her social status, profits or age won’t concern you. One loves not for money, apartments or career possibilities. One just loves a woman. Otherwise it’s not love.
