You know how your tuition goes up every year and your dad's salary isn't following it. Hey, Mom! Mom! Can I have a Music Helmet? I want a Music Helmet! Those things were banned at the last parents' meeting. They're too dangerous. But everybody has one! Even the kid next to me in school. You never listen to me. Your grades stay the same.

I heard they were in bed with the higher-ups. Five minutes to roll call! Everybody come to the hall right now. No discipline, no victory! Every day we have to give it all we've got! Shoot and blast with all your strength for our nation. ...and thus, we can calculate the theoretical location of the target by using the trigonometric functions... of Sine, Cosine and Tangent. However, to achieve even greater accuracy... we must take into account the external factors which create aberrations... weather factors such as wind speed and direction which may affect the trajectory of the shot... as well as the temperature and humidity... which determine the condition of the gunpowder's combustion. This will be covered in your chemistry class. Dispatch from H.Q., as of 09:20 today. Target data follows: Direction: 2 o'clock and 15 minutes. Launching angle: 42 degrees. Everybody in line.

Eat as quickly as possible and get back to work! There is no lunch break in the enemy's attack. We demand they use nontoxic gunpowder! We deserve the right to work under safe and healthy conditions. However, the gunpowder we now use contains harmful substances. Here, take one. The chief really did that? That's right. That's why he was transferred to this section. I heard it was because his wife is getting ready to have her baby. It might end up with a mustache! That's okay. His other kids don't like anybody anyway! I've never seen brothers as unlike each other as that. And besides that, his wife is unbelievable! Yeah! Barrel cleaning completed! Get ready to load the third shell! Lower crane! Lowering crane!

It'll be lights out soon. Dad, can I ask you something? Who are we fighting? You'll understand when you get bigger. Now go to bed. Yes, Dad! Fire! All right! Ten-hut! Forward! When I grow up, I want to be the one who fires the gun. Not just a cannon loader, like my dad. Ten-hut!
