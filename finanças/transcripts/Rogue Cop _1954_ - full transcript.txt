Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Are you blind or something? One side only. Big slob! You're through working my territory. Hold it, mister! You overparked, fifteen minutes. - Let me see your license. - Give me a break, will you, officer? I gotta get to the hospital to see my... There's a dead man in here! Hurry, officer, he was stabbed. - Hi, Rudy. - Hello, Syd. I guess you'd better talk to Ferrari about that. He's handling the case. All right. Nothing. Homicide up on your kid brother's beat. - Open for a half. - That folds me. - Raise once. - Okay. - And me. - Was Eddie around? He had the guy with the meat in his mouth. Only he didn't know he was the killer. Give me three. Two. - Can he identify the guy? - He says so. - How many to the dealer? - Uh, three. Who owns this? You do... for thirty-five cents. - Is Eddie in the building? - They're showing him the mugs now. - Opener still bets. - Once again. Up five. - Two's the limit. - Who said anything about a limit? - It's always been the limit, Dirk. - Not unless it's said. Nobody established a limit tonight. You won't get rich changing the rules in the middle of the deal. Is that how you got rich, by following the rules? Six bucks to me. Up ten. Pleased to have met you, Sergeant. - You're bluffing. - Find out. Thirty-five cents. And I hope you need it for car fare. No man with a fat pocketbook don't scare me. Let's go all the way. Forty-three bucks. You were made for me, Dirk. Four nines. Kings. Four of them. Well, that does it. I'll be downstairs with Lt. Atwill. - Eddie. - Over here. - Hello, Serg. - Who's that? Garrett, identification. - How are you, Ed? - Feeling pretty stupid right now. Yeah, I heard about it. Had the fence right in my hand on a traffic violation. - Didn't even get the license number. - Think you'd recognize him again? Sure. A little guy, sort of squarish. - Thick head, old-looking. - Could be lots of guys. Except I'd know that kisser anyplace. Squeezed-together face, wrinkled up like a little old lady's. - Wrinkled? - Like venetian blinds. - Hold it, Garrett. - Hold it. Ask him to pull a jacket on George Fallon. Pull a jacket on George Fallon. Comin' up. - Nice score if he's the one. - I'll make the book on it. Next mug after this one. - That's him. - Alright, hold it. Hold it. If you change into civvies, we'll pick him up. Let me check out first. I've got an errand to run. I'll meet you at my car in fifteen minutes. Want me to call homicide? No, thanks, we'll keep this one in the family. Okay, Serg. Okay, that's it, wrap it up. "Wrinkles" Fallon, Selma, where can I find him? Um, he hangs out in the pool room over on 6th. Card game in the back. Looks like a bad steer. Your help should be so good. I wish Pop could see us now. Remember how he used to say his two boys could... Pull your gun out. - Against the wall, everybody. - What's the idea, Kelvaney? - Have you got a search warrant? - Yeah, here. Wrinkles. Shake him down, Eddie. - What's this all about? - Forgot your parking ticket. I haven't been out of the place all night. It's time you got some fresh air. Get me the police, operator. This is Sgt. Kelvaney. Send us a car down at Joe's pool room on 6th. - Get 'em in. - Yeah. He takes a good picture. Handsome family. Quit shoving. Quit shoving already. That jeweler store squealer over on Market. Nice collar. Put him up. Come on. - Ever been inside? - Me? You're crazy! - How many times you've been arrested? - Never. Bet there's a sheet on you as long as my arm. For you, Serg. Preference. Kelvaney. No, I can't, I'm tied up. Won't it wait till tonight? Okay, about the third race. The horses are now on the track for the running of the third race. - Hello, Nancy. - Hi. - Where's Dan? - Down on the paddock. Waiter, fill it again. - Chris? - No, it's too early for me. I'm trying to remember when it used to be too early for me. I really hate to drink by myself. What's a girl supposed to do when she's alone? You have to drink, I guess. You should explain that to my keeper. Glad you could make it, Chris. The horses are at the post. Mind leaving us for about ten minutes, honey? - I'll buy a ticket on something. - Sandy Don to win. No more, sweetie. And be a nice girl and stay away from the bar. Don't be dull, Dan, you'll spoil my afternoon. There's a lot of refined people here. Friends of mine. You get out of line and I'll spoil more than your afternoon. - I'll behave. - That's my girl. I'll see you later. Horses are all in the gates. You know something, Dan? Loving you gets tougher all the time. The flag is up. Skip to it, Dan, what's the trouble? It's that arrest your brother made last night. They're off! What about the arrest? He can't go through with the identification. When did you people start doing business with lice like Fallon? I didn't say we did. But he can cause a bit of trouble. A punk like Fallon able to hurt you? Don't talk to me about being hurt. I don't like that kind of talk. Fallon gets off the hook because your brother doesn't identify him. - That's too raw. - We've been sweetening you a long time. Too long for something to suddenly look too raw. Well, Sandy Don the winner. Looks like I made myself a nice buy at 4 to 1. If Eddie changes his story, he gets booted off the Force. Is that bad? We'll take care of him. Offer him ten grand to start with. Offer another five if he holds out. A bit of trouble? Fifteen grand sounds like an awful lot of trouble. That's not like you. Asking questions you won't get answered. Ackerman and I want this thing squared away. Ackerman, huh? How come it's big enough for you and Ackerman? I don't get it. You don't have to. I put this on the line for your sake. We don't usually handle things this way. It's a little too expensive. - I'll talk to him. - He's your kid brother. He'll listen. I don't know. We don't see much of each other. How come? It's not like you, asking questions you won't get answered. The difference is when I ask, I already know the answer. - Your brother doesn't like your friends. - Lots of people don't. Not smart people. See him tonight. Get in touch with him at the Fanfare Club around 10 o'clock. - He doesn't go to work till midnight. - How would you know? We keep in touch. Didn't you know he had a girl? Nice looking. Walks with a bit of a gimp. Sings a pretty fair song. I'll be home all night. Let me know how you made out. Okay. Chris. You forgot something. - Help yourself. - Thanks. Not this time. - Hey, boy! - Chris! - What are you doing this far uptown? - Looking for you. Rumor's around you haunt this place. - Just about. Buy you a drink? - Yeah. - Scotch on the rocks. - How about you? Okay. - How about a table? - Why, sure. - Thank you. - You're welcome. They tell me your girl works here. Yeah, Karen Stephanson. I'm waiting for her to get into street clothes. We'll grab a sandwich outside before the late show. Sounds serious. This is all the way with me, Chris. The trouble is I don't know if it's mutual. Don't let any female think she's too good for you. Tell her about the Kelvaneys and the kings of Ireland. Show her it's a matter of pure history how we Kelvaneys owned a dozen of castles. There must be castles every square yard over there. You know, I never met a mick whose family didn't own one or two. - Thinking of marriage? - Twenty-four hours a day. Ever since I met Karen. They tell me marriage is tough on 65 a week. Maybe things will break. The Precinct captain hinted I might be in line for a commendation. That'll buy you a pound of nothing. Now you have to make your own breaks, kid. A setup like that Fallon squeal. He's in a position to embarrass some big people. They want to square the beef. Take good care of him. You came to the wrong store, Chris. You wouldn't be getting this kind of treatment if you weren't my brother. They'll step on you like a bug. I get a reprieve because my brother works for the big boys. Fifteen thousand dollars. More than you could save in a lifetime... ...pulling police boxes. I can almost feel Pop turning over in his grave. Oh, shut up. Don't pitch that kind hogwash at me. Okay then, let's skip it. It don't make sense, kid. Thinking of marriage turning down fifteen thousand dollars? Maybe so. Maybe you're the smart one and I'm the dope. Either way I don't like fighting you. It gives me a charge to see you, Chris, to kid around about the kings of Ireland. Let's stick to things like that and stop talking about the other business. If we do, you get killed. Get that through your stubborn head. What about your girl? Are you gonna be able to marry her from the cemetery? Forget it. I can take care of myself. You and Pop. Two babies hugging each other in big windy world. You think they'll let you be a good cop? Sure. If you don't bother them, you can be as efficient as you want on school crossings. Stick your nose in their business and they'll break you in two. You gotta think of the percentages. Comes a day you have to make up your mind which way to go. I'll stick with the ribbon clerks. - Buy a lady a drink? - Karen! - This is my brother. - Hello. Hi. Al, all around. Eddie told me what you did for him last night. It's pretty tough to do things for Eddie. He tries to talk you out of the doing. I'll get your coat. I've only got another hour or so. You, uh, live uptown? Midway, Empire Apartments. What about you and Eddie? Do you like him? You're not going to ask me my intentions, are you? No... It's my way of leading up to more questions. Thank you. We've met before, haven't we? I don't think so. Miami. Two years ago. How about having a drink with me after the late show? The Miami phase is over and done with. You'd better get that straight. You got the wrong picture. I want to talk about Eddie. I bet. - All set? - Yes. He's a pretty selfish guy. Hardly gave us a chance to get acquainted. - You're welcome to come along, Chris. - I'm sure. No, there's a fellow at the bar. I'll have a drink with him... ...then chase back downtown. - Don't forget the kings and castles. - Oh, cut it out. Let's have that nightcap. What's with you, mister? I don't know you. I'm a friend of your aunt Mathilda's. Give my friend a drink. And when it comes, drink it nice and slow. If I catch you tailing Eddie again, I'll break both your legs. Gesundheit. - Hello, Mr. Kelvaney. - Johnny. - Hi. - Hi, Nancy. Dan's tied up with Ackerman. Come on out and see our little village. Like living high up in a castle. Did you and Dan get things patched up this afternoon? That's never a problem. I just apologize to him, promise to stay sober, subdued, and act like a lady. And Dan decides not to throw me back in the gutter until next time. Tough way to make a living. Isn't it? At least I love the guy. What's your excuse? Wait for the bell, Johnny. I have to check in soon at headquarters. It's all right. How did you make out? - He'll go along. - That's fine. He's s smart boy. - Runs in the family, I guess. - That's right. Kelvaney, have him up here tomorrow night. I'd like to talk to him. - He's working the late shift. - He can call in sick. Someone sees him coming up here, it'll tip off the play. Chris, Chris, don't teach us our business. - Make it about eleven. - Okay. If there's nothing else, we won't keep you. Um, just one thing. You said you wanted to keep this thing friendly. That's the best way to do things. Then stop walking Eddie around. Keep a tail on him, Eddie's liable to whack in his teeth with a night stick. See you tomorrow night. Do you trust him, Dan? That brother angle bothers me. I'm like a guy on the banking business. Nothing on trust, I look for sound collateral. We got enough on him to hang him three times over. - What's he do for us? - A little bit of everything. Keeps an eye on the bookies, does a bit of collecting. Mostly settles beefs for us. Well, we've got a beef. You think he's the best man to settle it? Tell you what. Let's play it safe and hedge the bet. I'll bring somebody in from out of town to stand by in case we need a fast job. Best kind of collateral I know. Uh, calling Miami, Florida. Hotel Sunside. Anthony Lugacetti, person to person. No, that's c-e-t-t-i-. This is State 7661. That's right. Hello, Tony? Chris Kelvaney. Yeah. I'm fine, how's it with you? Yeah, I'll get back down there again one of these days. Look, Tony, I need some information. A girl named Karen Stephanson. Club singer. Average height, blonde. Walks with a little limp. She was down your way a couple of years ago, sometime in January when I was there. Yeah, that's the girl. Give me the whole picture, everything you know. Who is it? Chris Kelvaney. - Don't you know it's 2:30? - Yeah, I can tell time. I have to talk to you. Not at this hour. Let's not live for the neighbors. I said I have to talk to you. It concerns Eddie. It'll have to wait till morning. Don't make me kick that door in. Thanks for letting me in. Is that how you get what you want? Kicking people around. When I have to. It's a cozy place. You said you wanted to talk about Eddie. We'll get to him. Look. Look, it's been a long day for me. What is it, please? It's that arrest the other night. Eddies's got to refuse to identify the killer, otherwise he's in big trouble. Do you understand that? I think so. Some important people want it that way. Exactly. And you're a friend of the important people. I'm Eddie's brother. I don't want to see him killed. - Is that what they'll do? - Like that. That's why I need your help. What can I do? Tell Eddie you need money. Lots of it, eight or ten thousand for an operation. A whole series of operations to keep you out of a wheelchair. I couldn't do that. I couldn't make Eddie turn liar and thief. He's straight and decent, he's not the kind of guy... Okay, okay, I don't want a litany. Don't you love the guy? I don't know. What are you waiting for, butterflies in your stomach, stars in your eyes? Who do you think you are? What gives you the right to barge in here and cross-examine me? - Get out! - Just relax and talk nice. I know who you are and what league you played in. You were Frankie Nemo's girl, weren't you? - Yes. - Yes. Yes. Is that all you have to say? Where's the cute story? Didn't he hold a mortgage on the old plantation? Wasn't he threatening the virtue of your little sister, that kind of routine? I go for cute stories. There's no story. No plantation, no sister. I liked Frankie, that's all. That's not all, let's have the rest of it! - Let me go, take your hands off me! - Is that what you used to tell Nemo? Did you tell him to take his hands off of you? Oh, quit the act. I know you too well. We're the same kind of people, the same kind of dirt. Eddie is all that counts. I'm going to use you to keep him alive. You'll go along just like I say. Let me go, let me go! Does that prove it? Does that prove we're the same dirt? - You can't say that, you can't! - Take it easy? It's a little late to start fighting for your honor. Oh, won't you go? Won't you please go? Go! I'll give you till noon to call me and say you've talked some sense into Eddie. Tell him about the operations, he'll go along. Keeping Eddie alive is all that counts. Don't make me tell him about Frankie Nemo. Or what happened here tonight. Come in! Chris! Hey, this is great, great. No kidding, Chris, I'm glad you finally made it. Everything is still the same, isn't it? The only thing missing was you. And now that we got that fixed, how about a beer? - Sounds great. - Wonderful, I'll get it, ice cold. Make yourself at home. Pop framed them all. Everytime you made the newspapers, he'd put together another frame. Held on to your school trophies, too. They're all upstairs. - You want to see them? - That isn't why I came here. I didn't figure it was. But it's still no, Chris, and it won't change. I gave Beaumont and Ackerman my word you'd save them tonight. - You had no right to do that. - No? Should let them shoot your brains out, huh? I think about you a lot, Chris. About you and the old man. When the two of you had that blow up it near tore up my guts. Pop used to mope around the house and cry, way down inside. A hardest kind of cry. Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging you. - You cant judge someone you love. - Oh, turn it off. You remember me, Chris? I'm the kid used to hang around... ...when you were on traffic and watch you blow the whistle and wave your arm. I wish you'd been smart enough to stay out of the department. There was a day I wished it too. Back in the old 27th Precinct in the locker room. One of the cops was talking about some creep... ...who'd clipped a drunken driver for a lousy ten bucks and he wound up by telling me, "'Kid, your brother's got the right idea." "Take it big." I don't take it at all. They had to pull me off the guy, I pretty near killed him. - You sound like a recording of Pops. - Is that bad? No, great, if you like living in a dump like this, going through life being grateful to the gas company for fifty bucks a week. That's all you ever saw, isn't it? Well, Pop enjoyed his food. He slept a solid eight hours every night. And when he died, grown men and women cried. - They still miss him now. - Okay, okay, let's get off the old man. Why? Because you're still scared of ghosts? You're scared of Pop and what he stood for. What did he stand for? Do good, do everybody good! Honesty is the best policy, the preaching smelled up the house. Look, Eddie, I'm trying not to blow a gasket, I'm doing what I know to keep you alive. Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me finish. Go along with Beaumont and Ackerman up to the trial... ...then take the stand and identify the punk. The pressure will be to big for him to touch you. Okay? I've got to clean up and get going. I'm due to talk to Father Ahearn about Karen and me. You, uh... you're going to marry her? I'm hoping to. You're dumber than I thought. Better check the merchandise carefully before you buy it. - Get out. - Ask her about Miami and Frankie Nemo. She told me all about it. I'll bet she did, and made it a sweet bedtime story. Everything in the world is twisted and dirty to you... ...because you're always looking in a mirror. And everything is lily-white to you. Get all the details, sucker. Ask her about me, about the scene we played up at her place last night. It might save you a trip to Father... Wait a minute, kid, I don't want to fight you! Then beat it. And don't come back. Look, Eddie, I didn't mean what I said about... - Go on. - Sure, sure, I'm going. I just want you to know I was lying about Karen. That's on the level. She's straight. She wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole. I don't need you to tell me that. I know it. Now get out. # Tanto fatto bene il mio pupetto... # - Quanti anni ha suo marito? - Trenta quattro. - Avete litigato ieri sera? - Non, signore, no litighiamo mai. You're four years old? - Sa dove ? andatto suo marito? - No, no lo so. I've got something for girls who are four years old. - Avete parente? - Nessuno parente. In Italia si. - Hello, Christopher. - I'm tied up, Father. I just stopped by for a minute. When I wait this long for someone, I feel I've earned a small talk. Okay, how about the end room? Missing person. Husband took a powder on her... ...and the kids. - Anything special? - Nothing. What's the trouble between you and Eddie? - It's personal. - None of my business, is it? What was it about? The girl? I suppose you can say that, yeah. And just what makes the girl any of your business? - I'm his brother. - Oh, his brother, is it? His keeper, you are. Isn't that a new role for you? What's between Eddie and me doesn't concern you or the church. Just who is it you're talking to, one of your prisoners? When I have something to say to you, you stand still and listen... ...and give me none of your angry words. I'm sorry. But there's no point in talking. I can't spare the time. I'll get you a cab. You'll get me nothing. Get on with your important business. But stay away from Eddie. And stop interfering between him and his girl. The Father was sure breathing a storm. That Madison assault case gets arraigned this afternoon. Do you want me to take it? Yeah, I'd appreciate it. I have a stop to make at the city jail. - Okay. - Oh, Syd, are you, uh... Are you going to be home tonight? I promised the wife we'd see a movie. Could you switch it to tomorrow? Tell you what, I'll get you seats for the new musical, how about it? - Sounds pretty fancy. - I... may need some help tonight. - One of our squeals? - No, no, it's personal. - Personal? - Yeah, I'll call you before eleven. Don't bother, I won't be home. What's that mean? It means that you asked me to do you a favor and I said no, that's all. You meant more than that. Maybe so. Look, I've been in this business long enough to know... ...the world isn't run the way Father Ahearn would like it run. But I still got some pride in my job. In the department and in this squad. I'm tired of the fix. I'm tired of the cops who do business with lice. I'm tired of you, Chris. Go on, hit me. If you think it'll make you feel any cleaner. - Hello, Sergeant. - Hi, fellows. Could we save these a minute? I'd like to take a look at cell block 5. Not very sociable, is he? Okay, that'll do it. Thanks. Let's wrap it up quick, Kelvaney. By advice of counsel I don't even know what day it is. Constitutional privilege, he calls it. Word's around you're gonna be sprung. Got a match? You got some strong friends outside. I'm a friendly fellow. Beaumont and Ackerman tell me they're friends of yours, is that right? You talked to them, I didn't. They wouldn't be in the same tub with a creep like you. What's the squeeze, what are they scared of? I'm an eagle scout. I tie special knots and build fancy fires. Get your laughs now. Then figure what happens if you're sprung. You won't live ten minutes. Don't make a book on it. I figure to die in bed. Of old age. How far back do you go with Beaumont and Ackerman? I'm bored. Guard, take me home! What have you got on them? Why do they have to get you off the hook? Drop in again, Sergeant. I'll try to be in when you call. - Hello, Nancy. - Hello, company. Where is everybody? Don't I count? Yeah, sure, but I had a date for eleven with Dan and Ackerman. They'll get here. They always do. Just like Judgment Day. Don't go intellectual on me. Just keep it simple, I got too much on my mind. Then you need a drink. One for me, please. Sometimes you're a lot like them. Unlike other people, I mean. It's what frightens me about all of you. You don't care. Everything in the world is here just so you can use it. A girl, a car... a drink. It's all the same. What started this kick? Too many of these, maybe. That's how Dan analyzes me. You're a lush, you lush! Trouble is I don't feel like a girl anymore. More like a faucet. Dan turns me on and off, on and off, on and off. I love to dance. Even when it was my work, I loved it. How about taking me on a picnic, Chris? Sure, right out on the terrace. We'll have it catered by the Park Club. No, not the Park Club. They'd send over ants in tiny cellophane packages... ...to give the picnic a realistic touch. - I can't drink without ice. - No more for me. How come you don't wind up drunk like the rest of us? I don't know, I guess I just don't want to be anybody else. I do. I'll go get some ice and be somebody else. Maybe I'll be an ant at a picnic. You're a lush, you lush. - Mr. Kelvaney. - Hi, Johnny. Where's your brother? He had a date he couldn't break. Didn't he know we wanted to talk to him? Sure, he takes his social life seriously. We can get together later in the week. - He hasn't changed his mind about the deal? - Of course not. There's your answer, Dan. Yeah... there it is. I love you, Danny Boy. You are my Danny Boy. Get out, you lush! - You said it was alright today. - And now I'm telling you different. Don't, Dan, please. Clean it before I send you back to the gutter. - Your manners stink, Beaumont. - You butt out of this. Relax! Everybody relax. Okay. We're relaxed. Let's get back to business. Why did you lie to us, Kelvaney? You didn't make a deal with your brother. - We know you didn't. - I'm working on him. He didn't buy the proposition right away, but I'll bring him along. The point is that you lied to us. All of a sudden you couldn't take orders anymore. Even went around to see Fallon. This organization is not big enough for guys like you. - Get out. - You're not talking to a bellhop. I don't come and go when you push buttons. No? You'd better think it over. I got a file on you that's a foot high. And when it goes to the commissioner, you go to jail. Keep that in mind... bellhop. Johnny, Kelvaney is leaving us. - Don't make any trouble, Mr. Kelvaney. - Oh, relax. Didn't you hear him tell everybody to relax? Um, just one thing. About my brother. I'm tired of talking to you. Just a little more talk and both of you listen good. Nothing happens to Eddie, nothing! - Blow him out, Johnny. - Wait a minute. Remember what I said. Figure some other way to get off the hook, but leave Eddie be. Alright, Johnny, start throwing me. You and me don't want to fight, Mr. Kelvaney. You leave and there'll be no trouble... You shouldn't have done that. Now I'm gonna hurt you. Come on, stumblebum, you're no street fighter. I'll give you a lesson for free. Ackerman fixed all your fights for you, stumblebum, didn't you know that? It still goes. Nothing happens to Eddie. You got the brains of a two-year-old. No stupid jerk like your brother's gonna louse us up. That was only an expression, a manner of speaking. It's a manner I don't like. Danny got a tummy ache? Did the big man kick you back in the gutter? Let's everybody have a drink! Can't drink without ice. You're a lush, you lush. I didn't mean it, honey. Honest, I swear I didn't, sweetie. Mr. Ackerman, he caught me in the apple. I'd have taken him if he hadn't caught me in the apple. You couldn't take him with a tank. Find yourself another home. You're fired. I was only joking, Dan, you know that. You do things like that to me sometimes, don't you, sweetie? - Johnny, give me a hand, will you? - Yeah, sure, Mr. Beaumont. He sure can hit, can't he? I drank too much, but no more. I'm going on the wagon, I swear it. - You're going back to where you came from. - Dan, please. I told you it was only a crazy joke. I love you, honey, you know how I love you. Johnny, you know where Fanzo's place is? - Yeah, sure, Mr. Beaumont. - Take her there. Take her if you have to carry her. I'll phone Fanzo so he'll have the welcome ad out. Dan, no! Not to me, honey, you wouldn't, not to me! You did that to me in front of Ackerman. It was just a gag, a crazy gag. - I'm gonna pay you off good. - No! Fix you up so I never wanna touch you again. - Take her! Take her out! - No, Dan, please! Stop, it's a joke, just a crazy joke! Dan, it was a joke! Dan! Dan! Dan, please! Please, Dan! # I should know by now # - Are you expecting Eddie? - Why? Telling him more stories about me won't help. He knows you too well to believe them. As far as I'm concerned the two of you can get married any time you want to. It's nice of you to give your permission. Let's stop the knife-throwing. - You want a drink? - No. Whether you believe it or not, I'm glad Eddie feels the way he does about you. I wish you didn't. Look, don't start jumping down my throat. I think Eddie's the nicest human being I've ever known. But I'm... not in love with him. Oh, come off that routine. On you it looks silly. As far as you're concerned I'm just some breed of tramp. Not the type to wait for stars in my eyes or butterflies in my stomach. - Is that it? - Look, I didn't come here to argue. I've had a bellyfull of that. Right now I've got to find Eddie, time's running out on me. - Shouldn't he had been here by now? - Not till closing. He said he'd pick me up and drive me home. I don't know where you can reach him. This is Sgt. Kelvaney, Central Squad. Put me through to the 23rd. The, uh, the lieutenant's desk. Lieutenant? This is Sgt. Kelvaney, Central Squad. Yeah, I'm fine. Lieutenant, could you do me a favor? My brother will be checking in for the midnight tour. There might be a little trouble brewing for him. No, sir, the details aren't important now. Just tell him to stay inside until he calls me at the Fanfare Club. That's Crestline 3174. Thanks, Lieutenant. I hope he calls. - He will. - I'm not so sure. I haven't been very good at impressing Eddie. - Sure you won't have a drink? - No, no, thank you. I've got Ralston, one o my men staked out at the house in case he comes by there. What will happen if you reach Eddie? How will you stop these people? I'm not sure yet. The important thing is to find Eddie. I don't understand you, Chris. You're a detective, aren't you? Why don't you arrest them? Some of Eddie's philosophy must have rubbed off on you. What would I charge them with? It's their word against mine. My word isn't worth much, Karen. Even if they went to jail for a while, forty dozen of their thieves... ...would be outside gunning for Eddie. Fanfare. He's right here. It's for you. - Hello? - Hello, slugger. You're a tough man to reach. Nah, this is strictly business. I don't like getting belted around. But there's other kinds of trouble I like less. And Ackerman feels the same. The point is, how do you feel? Oh, I'm all for keeping things peaceful, you know that. That's the way we've always worked, isn't it? Do you still think you can get your brother to change his mind? Yeah, I'm... Well, it'll take me a couple of days. That's the time limit, Chris. Two days. With the same payoff. Look, Dan, I'm sorry about tonight, I didn't mean to blow my top. I'll talk to you tomorrow, next day at the latest. Sure, so long. Reprieve, forty-eight hours. Look, Karen, I can't swing this without you. No matter what you think of me, or things I've said and done, this is Eddie's life for keeps. - I know. - Then talk to him. Tell him... tell him you'll marry him if he'll listen to reason. You can make it sound right. Will you do it? I don't have much choice, do I? Not if you want to keep Eddie alive. - I'll do what I can. - Thanks. Maybe that sounds phony coming from me, but it isn't. I never figured to go shaking in the knees over someone else's life, but Eddie's done it to me. I feel like I've been put through a ringer. I guess I'll have that drink now. Nancy! - She insisted on coming up. - It's okay, come on in. - Take it easy. - Got a drink for a cast-off? We can sure find one. What happened to you? He kicked me out. Gave me to Fanzo and some friends of his. They're real gentleman, Chris. They gave me cab fare back to town. Here. I know I shouldn't have come here. I don't know why I did. Maybe it was seeing you on the fight. You're the only one they're afraid of. Did they say anything after I left about me or my brother? No. You don't know about him? What? Who? No. No... Please, no... I just heard about it on the cab radio. What is it? What? Your brother's dead. He was shot down in the street. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I'll be there. Two bullets in the back. There's a witness saw it happen. I think she was a freind of Eddie's. Karen Stephanson? - Where is she? - Headquarters, looking at mugs. I got here as quickly as I could, Christopher. We were all too late, Father. Oh, Sergeant, the lieutenant's waiting for you. Sorry about Eddie. They killed a nice boy. - Thanks. - Sit down. Ralston tells me that you had him staked out at Eddie's house last night. - It didn't help. - You phoned Lt. Winer too. Told him to tell Eddie to stay inside, trouble was brewing. That's right. DA's office sent this over for you. The grand jury subpoenaed you day after tomorrow. Questions and answers. A nice fat record full of nothing. Then another grand jury goes back to sleep. I've got a feeling this one will go all the way. - That'll be the day. - I'm not waiting. I'm through telling myself that my suspicions are all cockeyed... ...and that you really haven't been on the take. Today now I'm telling myself the truth. I'm getting rid of my rottenest apple. This is an unfitness report on you, Chris. Wait a minute, you can't boot me out now. I have to. For your good as much as the squad's. Are you worried about my soul, or do you want Eddie's killer? I've got an interest in both those deals. Okay, Vince, but you're not stopping me, just making it tougher. It's a little late for me to put on sack cloth and ashes. I'm a crooked cop. Those are dirty words but they fit. They're stuck to me with glue. Can't get rid of them by crossing myself and saying Hail Marys. Are you going to freelance on this squeal? He was my brother. Eddie had five thousand brothers in this city. - Brother cops. - Don't sneer about it! Five thousand or fifty thousand cops won't break this case. If you think they can, I'll give you the killers' names for a headstart. Beaumont and Ackerman and some hired gunman. And a hundred assorted goons, bagmen and politicians. Now you and your five thousand brothers go ahead and try to make a case. You won't, not in a million years, but I will. I know them, know the spots to hit. Hold it. Maybe working together we can crack it. With you on the inside, it'll help. - What about that report? - I've waited two years. I can wait another few days. All right, put some people on Beaumont and Ackerman. Somewhere, probably years back, Fallon got something on them. I don't know what, but it was big enough for them to rub out Eddie. It's pretty vague, but we'll try. - Is the witness back yet? - Yes, sir, about fifteen minutes ago. - Did she make any other implication? - No, sir. How many men are on this detail? Well, there's one in the alley, there's somebody on the roof... ...and there's a man outside the door. Thanks, Mullins. You ought to ask people for identification. Well, I've seen your picture in the paper lots of times, Sergeant. Okay, but stay on your toes. If the guy she spotted gets up here, he won't give you a chance. She's the only one who can push him into the electric chair. Don't worry, Sergeant, I can handle myself. Oh, sure. For sixty-five a week you're supposed to be able to handle anything, aren't you? All right, let's have. The whole story, everything. He was killed, that's what happened. - Just the way you said it would. - You saw the killer. I want to know about him, every detail you can remember. - I've told the homicide men everything. - Tell me. You? You're a friend of the men who killed him. You said we were the same kind of dirt, didn't you? But we're not. Oh, no. You let them kill your own brother, I'm not in that class! I don't want speeches. There'll be enough of those. The mayor, the commissioner, newspapers, priests, ministers, all kinds of speeches. And when they're through, Eddie'll be just as dead. So don't waste my time. Start from the beginning. He drove me home. It was about 2:30. I told him I'd marry him. He was very happy about that. We said goodbye in the lobby. He went out, I rang for the elevator. And that's when it happened. Two shots... Take your time. Okay? I ran outside... ...and he was in the gutter near the car. A man was running past with a gun in his hand. He stopped under a streetlight and fired a shot at me. I guess I started screaming and people heard me... ...or they heard the shots, I don't know. Anyway, the man ran down the street and around the corner. Tell me about him. He was big, not fat, but tall and broad. Dark bushy hair, he didn't wear a hat. Young? - Less than thirty. - What about his clothes? He wore a sports jacket, with a sports shirt, no tie. His jacket was some sort of light color, beige tweed or camel's hair, I think. They must have imported him. Kept him on ice until they needed him. But I'll get him. Oh, what good will it do? He can't bring Eddie back to life. They promised me 48 hours and I bought it. They wanted me out of the way so they could get to him. You'll go after them not because of Eddie... ...but because your pride is hurt. Not because they're cruel and evil people. Their crime is they made a fool out of Christopher Kelvaney. I told you to skip the sermons! You don't want to hear anything about right or wrong, good or evil. - It hurts to listen, doesn't it? - Shut up! You don't want anyone to tell you the kind of man you are. You laugh and sneer at the whole world... ...yet you're too sensitive to listen to its judgment on you. Well, one day you'll have to listen. Because you helped fire those bullets that killed Eddie. Don't say that! Don't ever say that again! Sorry about your brother. - Hear anything? - Everybody's nervous. Word's out Beaumont's looking for his girl. She knows some answers. Thanks, Selly. The guy I'm looking for is a big fellow. Dark, bushy hair, 25 to 30, wears sports clothes. Doesn't sound local. Yeah, but I don't think he's had a chance to jump town. A cockroach couldn't crawl out. Cops all over the place. It's important to me, Selly. There's five grand in it for anybody who locates this guy... ...and gets the information to me. - Who's paying out that kind of cabbage? - Me. I'd make it more, but that's the bankroll. I'll ask around real hard. How are you feeling? Feel? - Can I have a drink? - Yeah, a little while after we talk, okay? Why did Dan do this to me, Chris? I was as good to him as I knew how to be. I tried my best to be what he wanted. He must have liked me a little. All the time he never went with another girl. He used to laugh about it. Say he was getting old. But that wasn't the reason. He liked me. You've gotta start thinking about other things. Beaumont and Ackerman are looking for you. They're afraid of you. What's the reason, Nancy, what are they scared of? I don't want any more trouble, Chris. I couldn't stand any more trouble. There won't be any for you, not if I get to them first. They killed my brother, you know that, don't you? I don't know anything, nothing. Nothing at all! Tell that to them, Chris, please. Even if I could, I wouldn't bother them, never. Promises won't stop them, Nancy. I don't know anything, I swear it. But you must. Think about it. Something you overheard, something Beaumont told you. Nothing! Nothing! I gotta get out of here! Wait. You can't run around like a headless chicken. They'd pick you up in five minutes. Staying here isn't any good either. I'll get you to a safe place. Come on, fix yourself up. We're moving. Sergeant. - Everything quiet? - I can almost hear myself think. Yes, ma'am. Visiting someone? - I live here. - I've seen the young lady before, Mullins. - Third floor, isn't it? - Yes. - What's going on? - Just routine business. After you, miss. Nice going. Just remember. Wait at the foot of the stairs until I call you. Go ahead. Hello, Sergeant. - Anyone been here since I left? - No, sir. I'll be here for a half an hour, why don't you go grab some coffee? I'd like to, but I'm supposed to stick right here. Oh, I'll take over. If anybody bellyaches, just tell them I gave you an order. Thanks, Serg, I'll make it on the double. Come on. - Who is it? - Chris Kelvaney. This is Nancy Corlane. She needs a safe place to stay. She's in trouble with the people who killed Eddie. Come in. There's plenty of room. Thank you very much. Nancy's a bit shaky. She'll pick up after some sleep. I'll get you something comfortable to put on. I think this will be all right. - You can change in there. - Thank you. Do your talking with the radio on. The cops won't let her stay if they find out she's here. If homicide comes up to see you, just put her in the bathroom. - I can manage. - I'll be back after she's had some sleep. If she feels like talking, listen to her and try to remember what she says. She knows something about Beaumont and Ackerman that might be important. All right. Maybe you'd better give her a hand, she's pretty wobbly. Who is it? Who's there? Father Ahearn. Seeing you in this house would make the devil himself believe in miracles. Eddie will be needing his new uniform. There are things to discuss about the funeral arrangements. Do whatever you think is right. The wake will be at the funeral parlor starting at eight tonight. Thursday morning at ten I'll say the requiem mass. And his District is supplying fifty honorary pallbearers. The superintendent is coming, the mayor too, if he can get away. - That's great. - It's very good of them. Now, about the actual pallbearers. I've chosen five of his good friends from the neighborhood. And I left a place for you. Better get somebody else, I'll be busy. Too busy to come to your own brother's funeral? I'll be looking for his killers. - Who is it? - Chris. She only got to sleep a couple of hours ago. Must you wake her? - Please don't. - Lay off me! I've had enough don'ts for one day. I understand. I'm sorry. Well, I'll give her a few more minutes. - How's she been? - Not too good. She cried a lot, so I gave her a couple of drinks. They help calm her down. She had a rough time. Yeah, she told me about it. What kind of men are they, Chris? - Big and tough, the world in their pockets. - No, thanks. They don't believe in anything except a fix. Like a lot of people, they've never heard of Judgment Day. She told me about your break with Beaumont and Ackerman. About the fight. She thinks you're the greatest guy in the world. Well, she's a minority of one. Maybe not. I wouldn't have said the things I did if I'd known. Last night he was full of health, hope, big plans. Now, nothing. Oh, it's been a ghastly day. A long, long day. You need some rest. Please don't. I don't want you to touch me. Karen. You left Nemo almost two years ago, didn't you? Yes. Can I ask you why? I guess my automobile accident broke me up. In the hospital I had plenty of time to think about... ...myself, and Frankie. Try to understand why I got mixed up in that kind of life. When you think enough, a lot of truths come home and stay with you. So, I told Frankie it had to be finished and... ...when I left the hospital I kept right on going. Is it that easy to get out? The way you did, I mean. Easy? Try it if you think it is. Just say, forgive me, I've been wrong. That's all. But keep a stiff drink handy. The words may choke you a little. Forgive me. The only two people I could say that to are gone, Pop and Eddie. There's nothing left. There's you, Chris. Say it to yourself. It'll help. No... I didn't... You're safe, Nancy, you're safe. I guess I had a bad dream. How are you doing now? Pretty good. Look, baby, we've got to have that talk. Mother told me a man could get anything from a woman if he called her baby. Don't play around, please, this is too important. Beaumont and Ackerman are all out to get their hands on you. I'm scared, Chris. I don't want to get mixed up in it. What happens later? They'll keep on trying to get you, you know that. Should I tell him what I know? It would be the best thing to do, wouldn't it? I guess so. It's Fallon, Chris. He used to be one of those street photographers. He got a picture of Dan and Ackerman 15 or 16 years ago. That's all I know about it, I swear, that's all. - How did you find out about it? - Dan told me one night. He was the drunken one for a change. Could I have a straight shot instead? They just paid off Fallon a lot of money. Dan was cursing mad. I asked him why he paid him. He said because we want to stay alive, baby, that's why. He used to call me baby all the time. Thanks. He must have mentioned the Fallon setup to somebody. Last night, I was half-crazy scared, I told Fanzo and the others I was going to put Dan and Ackerman in the electric chair. And so they didn't waste any time telling them. Try to get some more sleep, Nancy. I could use one more of these first. I'll start checking the homicide files tonight. - Okay if I call you later? - I wish you would. I'm going on the wagon tomorrow. - Promise? - Honest. Rudy. I got some work for you. Thanks a lot. Go down to statistics and have them make a run. Pull all the unsolved murders, male or female, ...by any cause from 1939 through 43. Stick to the daytime squeals. What I'm looking for probably happened on some main street in town... ...some place where a street photographer would be working. Gotcha. - Anything, Manny? - One of your stoolies called in. - A woman. - Did she leave a number? No, just said to drop by at eleven sharp. To pick up that magazine you ordered. He's up in Inspector Cassidy's office. Ralston too. The DA's with him. We had a tip he might be the guy. I was sick in bed when it happened. I couldn't do a job on a fly. I got the bug in my lungs. - But you know who did it, don't you? - How many times do you want me to swear? Wrong number. They wouldn't use a creep like that. Can I see you a minute, Chris? Okay, let's take it from the beginning again. Not again! They want you upstairs, Cassidy and the DA. What did they want with you? To ask me how much you knew about the kid's killing. Why you staked me out at the house. They're out to throw the book at you, Chris. They should have tied a can to me long ago. Looks like a courtroom. I'm not interested in your wisecracks, Kelvaney. Just your resignation. I've been through that with the lieutenant. All I'm asking is another two days. Not two minutes. I never could stand the stink of a crooked cop. Hold it, Inspector. The district attorney's office has a stake in this too. Why the two days? I'll have a case against Beaumont and Ackerman. Do you think we're fools enough to listen to a man... ...who's carrying their money in his pockets? How else are you gonna score? Not through honest sweet-smelling citizens. Okay, Kelvaney, how much can you tell us now? I'm having a run made on all unsolved murders. Some time between 1939 and 43, Beaumont and Ackerman... ...took part in a murder. I think they were photographed in the act or in the getaway. Is this theory or fact? The picture will make it fact. "Wrinkles" Fallon... you're, um, holding him on that penny arcade killing, ...was the photographer, one of those street photographers. He's been putting a bite on Beaumont and Ackerman for 15 years. - And they did nothing about it? - What could they do except pay off? Fallon's probably got the picture in a bank vault somewhere in the hands of his attorney. Do you mind telling me how you got hold of this? No, I'm going all the way with you. Beaumont's mistress gave me the information. When can I talk to her? I'll bring her up to your office tomorrow sometime. Why not now? I don't like putting it off. Look, Kelvaney, you can't blame me for not going out on a limb just on your say-so. I've got to satisfy myself this information is kosher. That's sound arithmetic. I guess I can make it. I've got another lead to run down at eleven. Eleven? That's nearly three hours. Okay, I'll have her here by ten. Uh, what happens to the rest of the Beaumont Ackerman syndicate? If this works out, they'll run for cover. And grow another head. But I've got a witness who can give you every name, every date, every payoff. He knows he'll have to serve time after he talks but... ...he doesn't care. - Can you use him? - I most certainly can. Who is he? Me. Bardeman. Put somebody on his tail. I'll feel better knowing where he goes and what he does. - Sergeant. - Mullins. She didn't get back yet. Back? Miss Stephanson? No, homicide took her downtown to look over some suspects. - Carland went with them. - There's nobody upstairs to guard her? What for, nothing to watch. Nancy. Nancy! Kelvaney, Inspector. They caught up with Beaumont's girl. Drowned her in a tub after homicide picked up Karen Stephanson. - The whole detail... - Never mind the explanations. Just get in here and bring your badge and gun. I'll come in but not until I wrap this up! That five thousand still go with the answer? As soon as the bank opens in the morning. I wouldn't take the whole bite, Chris, except I gotta cut it out three ways. - That's how I got your information. - What you do with it is your business. A guy named Joey Langley from the West Coast. Holed up on Baker Avenue 6722. Waiting for the big fellows to pay him off and get out of town. - Thanks, Selly. - Watch yourself, Chris, he's a bad kid. Yeah. There's something else you can do for me. - Sure. - Do you know any of Beaumont's stoolies? Are you kidding? Stoolies Incorporated, we're practically one big fraternity house. Can you get some information back to Beaumont? Like Western Union. See that he finds out I've got Joey Langdon located and I'm on my way to pick him up. - Are you nuts? - Just in a hurry. - Can you set it up? - What about my money? How about an IOU? Something happens to you and I'm stuck with five grand... ...right in the middle of my partners. - Nothing'll happen to me. - That's an awful lot of cabbage, Chris. This'll keep me clean with my two partners. You better make it yesterday's date, the 14th. Give me twenty minutes to half an hour to contact Beaumont. I don't like anyone on my tail, Syd. Inspector's orders, Chris. He said for me to find out where you go or bring you in. - One or the other. - Nobody's bringing me in. You don't think I'm much of a cop, do you? - I never said so. - You didn't have to say it. I could see it in your face. Syd Myers, another dumb cop who'll wait around in his thirty-buck suit of clothes... ...until it's time to collect his pension. Maybe I felt that way once, but no more. Maybe I even wish I was the cop in the thirty-buck suit. We'd better start in. Let it lay. I'm not ready to go in. I don't figure to be able to take you, Chris. But if I have to, I'm sure gonna try. I don't want to tango, Syd. I've got a pretty positive lead on Eddie's killer, a chance to clean it up. - On the level? - Yeah. I move up a couple of notches when it comes to getting a cop killer. How about it? One more stop to make first. Beaumont's basement. Let's go. I think Bardeman will go to bat for you. Underneath he's not the worse... - It's the tip-off. - Is he calling Ackerman? Not yet. You sure they'll both come out? Figures that way. He's dialing. They can't afford to take enough time to find some hatchet man. They'll have to try to handle it themselves. It's Ackerman. - We're full up. - Just talk as natural as you can. You know of any vacancies in the neighborhood? He's a big guy, dark bushy hair, wears sports clothes. If he's here now, just nod your head. Uh, they might have a room across the street at 6723. I'll try them, thanks. Who is it? I've got a message from Beaumont. There's a gun right in your belly, mister. - Yeah, I can see it. - When I open the door, walk straight in. - Don't move your hands. - Okay. Up to the window. And don't turn around. Now lift up your hat. Slow, and with both hands. You know your business, don't you? Okay, now let's have a look at you. Beaumont wants you to clear out. I'm setting it up for you. I work for Dan, I'm a cop. Cop? Hey, I don't like this, mister. This setup stinks. Now blow it. Don't get nervous, sonny. You act like it was your first job. I'm just making sure it ain't my last, that's all. Now, let's see your potsy. And bring it out slow. Better take a look at the identification card too. This stinks worse by the minute. You'd be spending your payoff in Vegas about now... ...if you hadn't fumbled the job letting that Stephanson girl see you. Go on, take a look at the card, let's get going. Christopher Kelvaney. Kelvaney? Hey, that's the name of the... It was your last job, sonny. I'd cut off my hands and feet for another chance at you. You're not big time, you're old mouth. You'll find out how much when I turn you over to my brother's friends downtown. - I don't scare. - We don't scare, sonny. Both of us, we're big and tough. That's why we wind up like this. Little men begging for a break. Who's little? You're little enough to fit in the chair, that's all that matters. Open it up. Let your friends in. Let them in! - I'll get it in the belly. - Or the back. Chris? Yeah, Syd. I got worried you ran into trouble. - Is this the crud? - Yeah, says he's a real tough boy. Beaumont didn't fall for the gimmick, nobody showed up. I'll bet you don't last thirty seconds in the sweat box. Do me a favor, will you, crud? When homicide questions you, get stuffed, show them how tough you are. Make them beat it out of you, huh? You'll make me very happy. He oughta make you happy, Syd. He's gonna be a real quick talker. Hey, Syd! Syd! - Syd. - Take it easy. There's too much to think about. All the things I'll never get to tell Eddie. You're a lot like him, Syd. A better cop than I could ever be. Shut up and get some sleep. - Syd, I'd like to ask you. - Sure. What is it? To forgive me. Could you do that, forgive me? What? For letting me in on the biggest job of my life? Go to sleep.
