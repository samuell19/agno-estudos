(SIM?N LAUGHS) WHAT? DID YOU SEE IT? THOSE KIDS THAT ARE COMING... WHY CAN'T THEY STAY AT HOME? DARLING, BECAUSE THEY'RE SPECIAL CHILDREN... AND THEY NEED A LOT OF SPECIAL CARE.

(AFFIRMATIVE GRUNT) Carlos: WHY ARE YOU DROPPING SHELLS, SIM?N? Sim?n: IT'S A PATH FOR MY FRIEND TO FOLLOW... SO HE CAN COME HOME AND PLAY. Laura: HE MADE A NEW FRIEND. HOW'S THAT? Carlos: ANOTHER ONE? WE WON'T HAVE ROOM FOR ALL THESE KIDS. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (THUNDER CRASHING) (CAR APPROACHING) (KNOCKING) HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON. SORRY I DIDN'T CALL, BUT I COULDN'T GET YOUR NUMBER. I'M BENIGNA ESCOBEDO. I'M A SOCIAL WORKER. I'M SORRY YOU'VE COME SO FAR... BUT I HADN'T ARRANGED ANY INTERVIEWS FOR TODAY. INTERVIEWS? NO, I'M HERE FOR SIM?N. WHAT A SITTING ROOM! IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE. HOW DID YOU FIND IT? I GREW UP HERE. IT WAS AN ORPHANAGE. I ALWAYS WANTED TO RETURN, SO WE THOUGHT OF THE HOME. HOME? FOR SPECIAL CHILDREN. THAT'S NOT WHY YOU CAME? YOU'LL NEED A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR THAT. IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF A HOME. WE'LL BE HAPPY WITH FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN. MORE WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED, RIGHT? WHAT ABOUT SIM?N? YES, YES. OF COURSE. I RECEIVED HIS FILE YESTERDAY... AND THOUGHT, "I SHOULD VISIT THEM "IN CASE THEY NEED ANYTHING." (THUNDER) WILL YOU MAKE MANY CHANGES IN THE HOUSE? SORRY, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE HERE. (BELLS CHIMING) THIS INFORMATION IS OLD. I KNOW, BUT I RECEIVED IT ALL. THERE ARE NEW TREATMENTS, AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM... THAT REQUIRES AN APPLICATION, AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED. AS YOU MIGHT KNOW, MY HUSBAND IS A DOCTOR. WE'RE AWARE OF ALL TREATMENTS FOR SIM?N'S DISEASE. NOW PLEASE LEAVE. SIM?N DOESN'T KNOW HE'S ADOPTED, OR ABOUT HIS ILLNESS... AND I LIKE TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES WHEN MY HUSBAND IS AT HOME.

(THUNDER RUMBLING) (THUNDER CRASHING) WHAT ARE THEY HOLDING? TREASURES. TO PLAY WITH. I SEE. YOUR INVISIBLE FRIENDS PLAY TOGETHER? SURE. THEY STEAL YOUR TREASURE... SOMETHING YOU LOVE, AND YOU HAVE TO FIND IT. THAT'S THE GAME? FINDING WHAT THEY TOOK FROM YOU? YES, BUT FOLLOWING THE CLUES. IF YOU FIND IT, THEY GRANT YOU A WISH. WELL, NOW. AND YOU HAVE A TREASURE? SPECIAL COINS. AN OLD MAN LEFT THEM IN THE PARK. I THINK THEY'RE GOLD... AND VERY VALUABLE. WANT TO SEE THEM? (HEAVY RAIN) (SHUSHING) DON'T LOOK YET. Laura: WHERE'D YOU GET ALL THIS? Sim?n: I FOUND IT. WHAT'S THIS? THE FIRST ICE CREAM I HAD AFTER MY TONSIL OPERATION. THE SPECIAL COINS. THEY'RE NOT COINS, THEY'RE YOUR BABY TEETH. WHERE'D YOU FIND THEM? CAN'T YOU SEE? THEY'RE THE FIRST CLUE. THEY'VE GOT MY COINS. YOU WANT TO PLAY TREASURE HUNT? (SIM?N TUTS) THE GAME'S STARTED. REMEMBER WHERE YOU KEPT MY BABY TEETH. IF I FIND MY TREASURE, I CAN MAKE A WISH. SAND.

YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER, YOU'RE A LIAR! (DOOR SLAMS) (SIGHING) WE WANTED YOU TO BE A BIT OLDER TO TALK ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS. IF YOU WANT TO ASK US ANYTHING... IS SANTA CLAUS A LIE TOO? LISTEN, SIM?N... YOU HEARD MOMMY AND THAT LADY TALKING... SAW THE ENVELOPE AND INVENTED THE GAME... BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID TO ASK ABOUT IT. WHAT IF I DON'T TAKE THEM? NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.

(SOBBING) (SPLASH) (WATER DRIPPING) EMERGENCIES (PAPER RUSTLING) Doctor: CARLOS IS HERE. HE SPOKE TO THE POLICE... AND NOW HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU FEEL BETTER. (BABY CRYING) HOW ARE YOU? HE'S NOT IN THE CAVE. BUT I SAW SOMEONE, CARLOS. YOU MUST HAVE IMAGINED IT IN ALL THE CONFUSION. BELIEVE ME, HE WASN'T THERE. I'M PILAR. I KNOW IT'S HARD, BUT YOU MUST KNOW WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN... TO LOCATE YOUR SON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PILAR IS A PSYCHOLOGIST. SHE WORKS WITH THE POLICE. THEY'RE WORKING HARD TO FIND SIM?N. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. YOUR HUSBAND TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADOPTION... AND YOUR SON'S ILLNESS. AS HE WAS ADOPTED... THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES WE MUST CONSIDER. WHAT POSSIBILITIES? HE COULD HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A RELATIVE. I HEARD YOU RECENTLY FOUND... A WOMAN INTRUDER ON THE GROUNDS. BENIGNA ESCOBEDO, A SOCIAL WORKER, CAME A FEW DAYS AGO. WE CAN'T FIND A SOCIAL WORKER WITH THAT NAME. COULD YOU DESCRIBE HER? MM... SHE WAS ABOUT 70, WITH WHITE HAIR... PALE EYES, VERY THICK GLASSES. DON'T WORRY, WE WILL FIND HER. YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT. (POLICE RADIO) (CAR DOOR SLAMS) (DEEP BREATHING) (BOTH SIGH) HOW CAN THEY TRUST ME WITH THEIR KIDS AFTER THIS? (SIGHS DEEPLY) LET'S DO SOMETHING. WEAR MY GRANDMOTHER'S SAINT ANTHONY MEDAL, YOU KNOW I'M VERY FOND OF IT. TO BRING US GOOD LUCK. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT. EXACTLY. IT WILL WORK IF YOU HAVE IT. BUT IT'S NOT A PRESENT, I AM LENDING IT TO YOU. GIVE IT BACK WHEN WE FIND SIM?N.

THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY DISAPPEARED FROM HIS HOME SIX MONTHS AGO. THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DESPERATE... BECAUSE SIM?N IS ILL AND NEEDS DAILY MEDICATION. HIS PARENTS... Laura: MY SON DISAPPEARED SIX MONTHS AGO. HIS NAME IS SIM?N. THERE ARE POSTERS EVERYWHERE. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THEM. WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING... BUT NOT ONE CLUE... NOT EVEN A TRACE. MY SON HAD IMAGINARY FRIENDS. WE NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION... BUT I HAVE THE FEELING THEY'RE IN THE HOUSE. Woman: I SAW MY DAUGHTER. A YEAR AFTER HER DEATH. IT WAS AT NIGHT, WE WERE ASLEEP. I WOKE UP... AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHY, I WENT TO HER ROOM. AND THERE SHE WAS. SMILING. CALM. I THINK THAT WAS HER WAY OF TELLING ME... "I'M FINE, I'M SAFE. "DON'T SUFFER FOR ME." IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FEEL, IN SOME WAY... THE PRESENCE OF A LOVED ONE AFTER THEIR DEATH. ALL OF US IN THIS BEREAVEMENT GROUP COULD TELL YOU SIMILAR STORIES. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. MY SON IS NOT DEAD. HIS FRIENDS TOOK HIM. I SAW ONE OF THEM THE SAME DAY HE VANISHED. HE WAS AT HOME. I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO RECOVER MY SON. I'M NOT CRAZY... BELIEVE ME. I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. Woman on radio: ...CITIES ON STATE OF ALERT DUE TO GALES, RAIN AND SNOW. THE HEAVIEST SNOWFALLS WILL BE RECORDED IN THE NORTH. Man on radio: NORTH OF ASTURIAS. TONIGHT, IN SOME CITIES... 20 CM OF SNOW ARE EXPECTED IN THE CANTABRIAN MOUNTAINS REGION... CITIES THAT USUALLY END UP ISOLATED DURING THESE STORMS. AND... (? MUSIC PLAYING) (FAINT ECHOING LAUGHTER) (INDICATOR TICKING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) IT'S HER. THE WOMAN WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE. BENIGNA? (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING AND SHOUTING) SIM?N! (GASPING) Woman: HE DESTROYED HER. HE DESTROYED HER. Second woman: SHE'S DEAD. Pilar: WE WENT TO BENIGNA'S HOUSE. WE FOUND SOME PICTURES... AND OLD SUPER-8 FILMS. I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE THEM. ARE ANY OF THE FACES FAMILIAR? ANTONIA, THE PRINCIPAL, AND THESE ARE THE ORPHANS. MY FRIENDS. THIS IS MART?N. SHE LIKED TO BE CALLED MART?N. RITA. V?CTOR... I THINK HIS NAME WAS GUILLERMO. THAT'S ALICIA, SHE WAS BLIND. AND THIS IS ME. BENIGNA? THE WOMAN THAT WENT TO YOUR HOUSE... WORKED AT THE ORPHANAGE. Laura: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I'D REMEMBER. Pilar: SHE WASN'T THERE VERY LONG. SHE HAD A SON. TOM?S. IT SEEMS THAT THE CHILD WAS BORN DEFORMED... HE WAS KEPT AWAY FROM THE OTHERS. NO ONE KNEW ABOUT HIM. IT WAS A TOTAL SHOCK FOR THE VILLAGE WHEN THEY FOUND THE BODY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT SEEMS HE DISAPPEARED WHILE PLAYING. CHILD'S BODY FOUND ON BEACH SHORTLY AFTER YOUR ADOPTION. ONE OF THE ORPHANS LATER CONFESSED... THAT THEY HAD PLAYED A TRICK ON HIM. THEY WENT INTO THE CAVES WITH TOM?S... AND TOOK HIS MASK OFF TO SEE IF HE'D COME OUT. BUT HE NEVER EMERGED. HE DROWNED. THEY FOUND HIS BODY AT LOW TIDE. THE CHILDREN WEREN'T BLAMED. THEY WERE ONLY PLAYING. THAT BOY WAS IN MY HOUSE. WE ASKED EVERYONE AT THE OPENING PARTY. NO ONE REMEMBERS A CHILD WITH A SACK OVER HIS HEAD. (TICKING) (? PLAYS SINGLE NOTE) (SOBBING) (PLAYS NOTE) (TICKING) (DISTANT SQUEAKING) (DISTANT CREAKING) (CREAKING) (SIGHS) I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT. I CAN'T STOP THINKING. REMEMBER WHAT WE CALLED SIM?N WHEN WE MET HIM? "TWO LITTLE KILOS". YOU USED TO SAY, "MY TWO LITTLE EXTRA KILOS." THAT'S ALL HE WEIGHED. THE DOCTORS SAID IT WASN'T ENOUGH. BUT IT WAS PLENTY FOR US. ALTHOUGH WE KNEW THAT... THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE HE COULD EVER BE NORMAL. BUT WHEN WE SAW HIM... SAW HIS SMILE FOR THE FIRST TIME... HIS EYES, HIS BRIGHT EYES... SIM?N MADE US STRONG, CARLOS. TOGETHER, WE'RE STRONG. TOGETHER. FORGIVE ME IF I GET UPSET, BUT IT'S HARD. CARLOS, SOMEONE'S IN THE BATHROOM. (CREAKING) Carlos: WHAT IS IT? SOMEONE WAS HERE. CARLOS, DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK. FEEL, IT'S STILL WARM. SURE, I JUST GOT UP. SOMEONE GOT INTO THE BED. I'M CONVINCED. (CLOCK TICKING) Man: THAT'S WHAT JUNG MEANS WHEN HE SAYS... IT'S IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS THAT THE LIVING COEXIST WITH THE DEAD. THE GERMANS HAVE ANOTHER NAME FOR "THE HERALD OF DEATH". DOPPELGANGER. A BEING THAT APPEARS IN ONE'S OWN IMAGE. A DOUBLE. TO GLANCE AT HIM... OR AT ANY OF THE OTHERS I'VE SHOWN YOU... MEANS, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT... A PASSPORT TO THE OTHER WORLD. HOW LONG HAS YOUR SON BEEN MISSING? NINE MONTHS. STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. THINGS LINKED TO HIS DISAPPEARANCE. I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TURN TO. IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. YOU WON'T FIND AN EXORCIST IN THE YELLOW PAGES. I TORE IT FROM MY SON'S KIDNAPPER'S CLOTHES. THE POLICE SAY HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR OVER 30 YEARS. SOMEONE HAS MY SON. I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT I WON'T SIT AT HOME AND WAIT. UM... THERE'S SOMEONE IN THIS FIELD, SOMEONE I TRUST. I'M TALKING FROM THE HEART. WOULD YOU ALLOW A MEDIUM TO VISIT YOUR HOME? THIS WASN'T A CHILDREN'S ROOM IN THE ORPHANAGE, RIGHT? NO, THE BEDROOM WAS BACK THERE. THEN WE SHOULD START HERE. ENRIQUE. PERFECT, GIVE ME AN HOUR. I WANT AN OLD OBJECT FROM THIS HOUSE... SOMETHING RELATED TO ITS HISTORY, AND, IF POSSIBLE... SOME CLOTHING FROM THE PAST. (FOOTSTEPS) WE'RE NOT ALONE. (DOORBELL) THERE'S A POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST, PILAR... WHO WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ATTEND THE SESSION. IF YOU DON'T MIND. PERFECT. PERFECT. COPS ARE COOL! (WHIRRING) (CRACKLE) Pilar: WHAT DOES SHE NEED THAT DOLL FOR? AURORA NEEDS AN OBJECT TO FACILITATE HER TRANCE. CLOTHING AND OBJECTS GET HER INTO IT... AND BEGIN THE REGRESSION. Pilar: REGRESSION? Man: A PSYCHIC SUMMONING. PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ARE SUPERIMPOSED, AND CROSS. LIKE A SORT OF TIME TRAVEL. Man: IT MAY SOUND LIKE WITCHCRAFT... BUT YOU MUSTN'T FEAR PARALLEL PERCEPTION. IF THERE'S ANYTHING, AURORA WILL SEE IT. IF THERE'S ANYTHING, I HOPE WE'LL ALL SEE IT. Man: EVERYTHING'S READY, ENRIQUE. (CRACKLING) READY, WHENEVER YOU WANT. (WHIRRING) (CREAKING) (FEEDBACK WHISTLING) AURORA, CAN YOU HEAR ME? PERFECTLY. I'M READY. Man: HERE WE GO. Man: EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS BEGINNING TO FADE. DARKNESS IS FORMING A CIRCLE AROUND YOU... IT'S CLOSING IN ON YOU. EVERYTHING IS FADING. WE'RE NO LONGER HERE. NOW YOU'RE ALONE IN THE DARKNESS... AND THE DARKNESS BEGINS TO DISAPPEAR. I'M GOING TO COUNT DOWN... FROM TEN... AND ONCE I'VE FINISHED... YOU CAN GO WHEREVER YOU WANT... AND WILL BE ABLE TO SEE... ANYONE WHO IS HIDING IN THIS HOUSE. TEN... NINE... EIGHT... SEVEN... SIX...

IS THERE ANYONE WITH YOU IN THE ROOM? I CAN HEAR SOMEONE. I CAN HEAR... (FOOTSTEPS THUMPING) (CRACKLING) I CAN HEAR SOMETHING. I CAN HEAR SOMETHING. THE SOUND COMES AND GOES. (WHIRRING) I CAN'T HEAR IT ANYMORE. I THINK I'VE LOST THEM. I CAN HEAR SOMETHING. (CRACKLING, FAINT VOICES) Child's voice: ALL ALONE. ...ALL ALONE. Aurora: CHILDREN... I'M SURE IT'S CHILDREN. AT THE END OF THE HALL. I THINK IT'S THEM. (FEEDBACK WHISTLING) (CRACKLING, FAINT VOICES) (RADIO STATIC) I CAN'T OPEN IT. IT'S CLOSED. (CRACKLING) BUT THERE'S SOMEONE. (FAINT CRIES) WHY ARE YOU CRYING? Child: WE'RE SICK! WHO'S SICK? I WON'T HURT YOU. DON'T BE AFRAID. OPEN THE DOOR. (FAINT SHOUTS) DON'T BE AFRAID. OPEN THE DOOR. Child: WE WANT YOU TO OPEN THE DOOR! (ECHOING VOICES) (DISTORTED SCREAMS) (SCREAMS CONTINUE) WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU? (CRYING AND SCREAMING) WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Man: AURORA... TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE. FIVE CHILDREN. THEY'RE VERY SICK. THEY'RE CRYING. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED? (CRYING AND SCREAMING) THEY'RE DYING. WHO WOULD WANT TO POISON YOU? (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Child: SOMEONE'S GOING TO KILL US. SOMEONE'S GOING TO KILL US. IS MY SON THERE? AURORA, IS SIM?N WITH YOU? IS SIM?N HERE? (DISTORTED SCREAMS) (STATIC) (CRACKLING, INDISTINCT NOISES) (FAINT VOICES, SOBBING) (CRACKLING DROWNS VOICES) Man: AURORA? AURORA, CAN YOU HEAR ME? LET'S GET HER. AURORA, STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. I'LL COUNT FROM TEN. TEN... NINE... EIGHT... SEVEN... SIX... FIVE... FOUR... THREE... TWO... ONE. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Aurora: I WAS IN THIS HOUSE, BUT... EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT. THE BEDS, THE TOYS, THE D?COR, EVERYTHING WAS MUCH OLDER. THE LIGHT FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE CAME THROUGH THE WINDOWS. ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE SIM?N? IT WAS TOO DARK, I'M SORRY. I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE ANYONE. BUT THE CHILDREN WERE THERE. YOU SAW THE CHILDREN. IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GHOSTS. Man: AND WHAT IS A GHOST, CARLOS? THERE'S SOMETHING HERE, AND WE ALL SAW IT. WHEN SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS... SOMETIMES IT LEAVES A TRACE... A WOUND THAT ACTS... AS A KNOT BETWEEN TWO TIME LINES. IT'S LIKE AN ECHO... REPEATED OVER AND OVER, WAITING TO BE HEARD. LIKE A SCAR... OH, I'M SORRY. LIKE A SCAR OR A PINCH... THAT BEGS FOR A CARESS TO RELIEVE IT. LAURA... WE WHO ARE CLOSE TO DEATH... WE ARE MORE RECEPTIVE TO THESE MESSAGES. HMM? YOU MEAN MY SON COULD SEE THOSE CHILDREN... BECAUSE... WELL, LAURA... I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH. PLEASE TAKE YOUR THINGS AND LEAVE. CARLOS, WE CAN'T LET THEM GO LIKE THIS. Pilar: LAURA, THIS IS A FARCE... A SIDESHOW TRICK. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. WHY? FOR WHAT REASON? THEY'RE RIGHT, AREN'T THEY? THEY DON'T WANT MONEY. NOT YET. Laura: WHAT SHOULD I DO? TELL ME, WHAT SHOULD I DO? IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, AND THE POLICE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A SINGLE CLUE... NOT A SINGLE CLUE... AS TO WHERE MY SON CAN BE, WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE. WHAT DO I DO, JUST SIT AND WAIT? CAN IT HURT TO LISTEN? LAURA, STOP! NO, YOU STOP! TELL ME, PILAR... HOW MANY SIMILAR CASES HAVE YOU HAD IN THIS DAMNED VILLAGE? GET ANOTHER DISTRACTION, I DIDN'T INVITE YOU HERE. (ENGINE STARTS) WHAT SHOULD I DO? MY DEAR... YOU ARE A GOOD MOTHER. YOUR PAIN GIVES YOU STRENGTH, IT WILL GUIDE YOU. BUT ONLY YOU KNOW HOW FAR YOU ARE WILLING TO GO... TO FIND YOUR SON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU HEAR, BUT DON'T LISTEN. SEEING IS NOT BELIEVING. IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND. BELIEVE... AND YOU WILL SEE. THE SEARCH FOR SIM?N CONTINUES WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE CAN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER. WE SHOULD GO, AT LEAST FOR A WHILE. THE CHILDREN ARE HERE. AURORA SAW THEM. I CAN'T LEAVE. YOU HEARD THE VOICES. ENRIQUE WAS UPSTAIRS FOR ONE HOUR, PLAYING AROUND WITH THE CABLES. CAN'T YOU SEE IT COULD BE A SET-UP? THAT'S PILAR'S THEORY, A SET-UP? HER RATIONAL THEORY? PILAR IS PROTECTING US. FROM WHAT? THINGS LIKE THIS EVENING. PEOPLE ENTERING OUR HOME AND FUCKING UP OUR LIVES EVEN MORE. THEY JUST WANT TO HELP. HELP? DIDN'T YOU HEAR THEM? DID THEY MENTION FINDING SIM?N? NO. THEY JUST WANT TO CONTACT THE DEAD, LAURA. IF SIM?N'S ALIVE, I CAN'T SEE HOW THEY CAN HELP US. IF HE'S NOT, THEY WON'T RECOVER HIM. I'M NEITHER WILLING NOR ABLE TO KEEP TAKING THIS SHIT. PLEASE, LAURA, LET'S LEAVE THIS HOUSE. CARLOS, YOU CAN'T ASK ME TO GIVE UP. NEITHER YOU NOR PILAR. LAURA, WE CAN SURVIVE THIS. MANY COUPLES LOSE A CHILD AND PULL THROUGH. I JUST WANT TO BE WITH SIM?N, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IF YOU WANT TO GO, I CAN'T STOP YOU. I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM, CARLOS... THAT'S ALL I WANT!
