[rain splashes] [plane flies overhead] I must make my return journey in 30 minutes. Quite simply, if we are to win the war with the Japanese, we need the help of you and your rebel forces. What do you offer me in return? Officially, you are still supporting Chiang Kai-shek. Yes and the Pentagon attitude is that we've already thrown away more than enough lend lease on him. We're not able to offer any more in the way of arms and ammunition. Which are the only things I need in my struggle. But my hands aren't tied behind my back. And I'm sure we can find a way for the RAF to fly weapons and ammunition to you over the hump to Kunming. Say... 10,000 tons a month. But what would I have to do for such munificence? Something. We'd have to have something and something that would have a currency for us, if you and your forces eventually win and control China. Ah, I can see you already have that something in your mind. Slightly more tangibly so. The Hong Kong treaty. The lease to Great Britain. It expires on July the first, 1997. So? I'd like you to extend it for, say, another 100 years. [laughs] I think the rains have made you lose your senses. Chiang Kai-shek rules China. The Japanese permitting, Mao Tse Tung permitting, I think I know my man, Mao. I've drawn up a covenant for us. A covenant? I'll explain. The Christian God made a promise to the Israelites, and they made a commitment to him to worship him alone. That is a covenant. And this covenant? Does it worship me alone or you? It binds His Majesty's government to supply you with all your military needs. If you agree to extend, should you ever control China, the Hong Kong treaty, by another 100 years. I think it's easy for me to say yes, Lord Mountbatten. Have you got a pen? Ah. Thank you, Corporal. One for you. One for the Prime Minister. And one for President Roosevelt. And, uh, one extra, sir. Just in case of accidents. Good man, Ian. [dark orchestral music] Mountbatten and Mao both signed this so-called Chungking Covenant. You cannot imagine the power of the Chairman's signature on such a document, even today. And there's no official record of this document? It was... Chungking China. 1944. There was me, and the major, my late Ian Campbell. Top secret, Jack. Only you and I know it's there. Your highland oath on it. You have it, Laird. You know you have. But maybe the Chungking Covenant can help. If you can find it. What? Do you have any further confessions to make? No, Father. I can aim to have them justified. I'm glad to hear that. For your sake, my son. [gun fires] [guns fire rapidly] [helicopter blades whir] [guns fire rapidly] Remember me? I oughta kill you now! I'd think about that! Things change! That was another country, another time! I've got a proposition for you, better jump in! [guns fire rapidly] Meet Detective Inspector Hannah Bernstein, Special Branch Terrorist Unit, succonded to me for the duration. Sean Dillon. I know a great deal about you, Mr. Dillon, and I can't say I approve. You don't have to, just work together. If he doesn't behave, we'll just take him back to where he came from. If you were so fond of these people, then why did you quit the grand cause? Who said I was fond of 'em? All right. You wait here. The hell I will. This pub's IRA. I walk in there with you, they'll take you around back, blow a hole in your head and I won't get anything. But you're the boss. I swear by all the saints. Something tells me that's a great, big- Dillon, for God sakes! Lie. [gun fires] You're dealing with China, but not getting very far. It won't be long. I've arranged to have someone taught a lesson or two. [engine roars] [glass shatters] [patrons scream] [gun fires] It'll be a bomb! Right, but this is how it goes. No! Billy boy. This is how it goes. â™ª Pop goes the weasel [gun fires] [suspenseful music] [thuds] [grunts] [rapid thuds] [Sean groans] [rapid thuds] [thud] [thuds] [thugs groan] [muffled chatter] [explosion roars] It was one of his best, too! [explosion roars] [gun fires] [groans] What do you think his chances are? Bellemy is the best surgeon in the country. That's how good his chances are. Tell me. I've seen worse, but- But? They were dead. I'll help your uncle any way I can. Thank you. [ominous music] [tense music] [somber music] [thuds] [tense music] [door slams] [muffled thud] [thud] Where am I? A safe house. Where? London, Holland Park! Please, I hate guns. Then you should change your clientele. [gun fires] [distant laughter] God bless all here. God save you kindly, Dillon. [gun fires] I know you're a bastard, Dillon, but for all you knew, you could've killed us. I knew they were blanks, there was no recoil. [sighs] Well, it's been more fun than Euro Disney. Listen, you could've saved yourself a lot of trouble by just asking me if I was ready. I had to be sure you still had your appetite. Oh. Welcome back. You listen to me. If I work for you again, it's on my terms. Which are? You pay me, up front. You drive a hard bargain, but if you insist. All right. What've you got this time? We don't exactly know what yet, but the who is the Sicilian mafia and a gentleman called Carl Morgan? There's one more person involved in this business, Mr. Dillon. Carl Morgan. At his best, Morgan is a wonderful front man for the mafia. Goodness knows how much money's been laundered through his world leisure empires. At his worst, some kind of enforcer. What's he got to do with the investigation, or me? I understood that the Sicilian mafia was one of your sources for buying weapons for your clients. That's right. Why, you'd do anything, if the price is right. Perfect credentials for getting in the good graces of Morgan when we can locate where he is. That is his step-daughter, Asta. She's somewhere in England, so he won't be far away. Attractive, isn't she? Hm, looks like he agrees with you. Why do you say that? Look at him. Can't keep his hands off of her. What about the wife? Dead. Drowned, a year ago, diving. Off a Greek island. Here's the autopsy. Faulty tank. What do you think? This is no accident. This is it? This is the report? Morgan wasn't even questioned, I got that from the dead file from a friend in Greek Intelligence. Somebody put a stop to the investigation. You think he killed her? Or arranged to have it done. Maybe she knew too much. Or maybe it was something else. Maybe he wanted Asta for himself. [melancholy orchestral music] Hey, there! Hey. I wanna talk to you. I was just thinking of you. Why? Because I worry about you. You're being torn in two. You're too smart for me. Isn't that why you like me? Oh, by the way. You haven't talked to me yet. [Sean chuckles] It's nothing, really. I have a lead on Morgan. Your uncle should be happy. Employment aside. No matter who's involved, no matter how dangerous. Yeah, but that's what you like, isn't it? The danger. Morning, Nigel. Any news overnight? Another coded communication from the Sicilian source, via Hong Kong. Seems we have confirmation of the original source of information. I've just been translating it for you. I admire your dedication, Nigel. But I think you're overdoing it. You're working too hard. I can't bear being alone at home, Charles. It's that simple. Helen was ill for so long, I still make two cups of everything. Put too much water in the soup. Can't you find a friend to spend some time with? Loneliness is a trap in our business. I know, uh, don't worry. And, uh, thanks. The source was New York? Yes, a young doctor, but related in some way to the Luca clan. Surprise, surprise. Get Bernstein. I want her on the first plane to the States. [engines roar] [upbeat dance music] [computer bleeps] [muffled upbeat dance music] [upbeat dance music] [distant boat horn blows] Dr. Jackson? Yes? I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may? About what? About something called the Chungking Covenant. I don't know anything about it. This is a transcript of a conversation you're reported to have had with the Don Giovanni Luca. Do you deny that? You can't lock me up for making a phone call. But we could make life very difficult for you with the Board of Trustees. The New York Medical Association might even tarnish what could be a brilliant future. And all because I need a few extra details to help fill in the missing pieces. [smooth pop music] You like dancing alone, don't you? Excuse me? Looked like you could use a dance partner. [chuckles] Who do you think you are, Fred Astaire? I'm Sean Dillon. Very nice. But I have to go. Why wouldn't you dance with me? [groans] I can tell you've had a lot to drink, so I'm just gonna let you go. I was only having some fun, that's all. You video all your patients? Sure. I'm funded by the Bates Foundation to do a study of latent aggressive tendencies in terminal states, such as we find in the patients here. You're very lucky, Miss Bernstein. You can see exactly what you say you need. Or does that offend your delicate nature? I take it with me in my flying jacket. [rain splashes] [thunder rumbles] Piece of history, Jack. Aye, we'll make sure it stays safe. Pass me my Bible, will ya? Cheers. [tense music] [plane flies overhead] [thunder rumbles] Top secret, Jack. Only you and I know it's there. Your highland oath on it. You have it, Laird. You know you have. Right. Let's go! So he had it with him on his person, when we flew out. What happens next? He isn't too clear about it. He figures Mao went back on his deal when he came to power. As for the copy in the Bible, he and the major got into enemy interference on the way back. The major was wounded badly. They made it back to Scotland, he lived on. But kinda shellshocked. But what about the Bible? Did that make it back? I asked him about it. He kinda chuckled. It got back too. In a matter of speaking. [chuckles] "In a manner of speaking," what does he mean? That's all he said about it. And that's all you told Don Giovanni? Is it really that important? Well, they seem to think so. So we have to think so, too. And one more thing, Dr. Jackson. Let's keep this conversation a secret. [suspenseful music] [door slams] The 23:55 overnight sleeper service for Glasgow and Edinburgh. This train is built from two portions. The front portion for Glasgow, calling at Carlisle... [computer bleeps] [computer bleeps] I'm sorry but the signals just keep getting fainter and fainter. Where the devil is he going? [train horn honks] [helicopter blades whir] [helicopter blades whir] Well, here they are. Now we can get the rest of the new tiles for the roof. This Carl Morgan says he might be interested in more than just a vacation. His company's in the leisure business. Golf courses and the like. Oh, you'd not sell, would you, Kate? I don't know how much longer we can survive, hand-to-mouth, the way we do. And neither of us are getting any younger. Some impressive history around here, huh? Ought to be soaked in enough blood, even for you. Don Giovanni's estate is older, Carlo, and in its history, much more blood was shed. Come on, let's put on some Highland smiles and give them good value for their lovely dollars. Hi. I'm Carl Morgan. My associate, Marco Tavianni. And you must be Lady Katherine Campbell. I am, indeed, and you're welcome. Though Lady Kate's enough of a mouthful for anyone. My factor, Stuart Murdoch. Aye, welcome to ya. Surely it's not just the two of you? No, my stepdaughter's coming up by train. She is due to arrive at Shiel Station at noon. Bring the cases, will you, Murdoch? [brooding music] Shiel! Shiel station! It must've been wonderful to be born here. Born and bred these thousand years, as my father used to say. [phone rings] Oh, excuse me. Hello? Oh, Carlo. I don't know how they know, but eh, a British police officer has been talking to Tony about the Covenant. Be careful. [Carl speaks Italian] But I'm here on my business, too. I have trips to make, people to see. A schedule of meetings. Marco's here to take care of that kind of business. I'll hand you over. And how long has it been all yours? Quite a few years. And no laird to share it with? Technically, I'm the laird, but yes, I live alone. How did you know? [dark orchestral music] It's a business habit I've gotten into. Finding out everything I can about my arrivals. [chuckles] And of course, potential partners. So I've come to know a lot about you and your family history. Oh, there's plenty more I'd like to know. Might I suggest then that you join me for lunch? There's nothing I like better than to entertain new friends in traditional Highland style. We'd like nothing better, would we, Marco? But I have to pick up Asta at the station. [brook babbles] [bird squawks] You can reach the track around the loch from here, but it's 12 miles or so, she could easily get lost. We'd better go look for her. We could try. [brook babbles] [suspenseful music] Well, well, well. Would you look at this now? Who are you? Who am I? [tools clang] And you're the one that's trespassing here? What do you want? I'll give you three guesses. What're you doing here? My father is a tenant of Lochdu Castle as of today, and I have a perfect right to be here and to ask who you are. I couldn't give a shit about your father. How dare you waltz in here and talk to me like I'm shit. [groans] You little... [Asta screams] [thud] [groans] [groans] [glass clinks and shatters] [thud] [thud] [screams] [Sean pants] Thank you. Why did you follow me? Asta? I told you. I wanna talk to you. All right. Asta! Oh. [footsteps clack] Asta. Carlo. Thank God you're here. What happened? There was no car at the station and I walked. You walked over that mountain? And then I got lost, I'm sorry. I saw a man running out there. He attacked me and... Mr. Dillon helped me. I'm Carl Morgan. This is Lady Katherine Campbell, the laird of Lochdu Castle. My daughter, Asta. I don't know where you've sprung from, Mr. Dillon, but I think we owe you some hospitality. Of course we do, Mr. Dillon. [ominous music] [footsteps clack] So what's so important? I've gotta get back on schedule. You must follow Don Giovanni's wishes. Find the Covenant. I told him I would, if I could. That takes time and diplomacy. Look at the size of this place. If it's hidden here, somewhere, it could take weeks to search everywhere. The police and British Intelligence are also on the trail of these documents. We must be very careful, but we must be quick. I don't like this Dillon. Well, such good timing. There you are. And look who've just arrived. An old friend of my father's, Brigadier Charles Ferguson, and his niece, Hannah. [ominous music] God bless all here. Brigadier Ferguson's one of my family's oldest friends. It's been years, though, hasn't it? Indeed, I know that my niece would love to visit Lochdu on her way north. It's kind of you to invite us at such short notice. I don't think we've heard just what you're doing here, Mr. Dillon. I was on my way through as well headed north. We met in a club and he followed me. How romantic. I saw him in Glasgow changing trains. In the case of war, lying is an indispensable ally. Is the same true of love? I've never been sure. I think it might be. You followed my daughter? To be honest, Mr. Morgan, I came here to meet you. Well, you've met me now, and I'm sure there's a reason for it. But usually I don't meet with anyone, without being scheduled. And if it's Asta you're after, I thank you for coming to her aid, but I don't take kindly to wayfaring strangers. Let me give you some advice, Mr. Dillon. No, let me give you some advice. Never wear brown socks with black shoes. Aye. I've heard that, too. So, Senor Tavianni, is this your first trip to Scotland? It is. Are you here for the hunting? Oh, are you an expert? Let's say I'm always trying to improve. It can be very frustrating when one is not a complete expert. In the mind of the beginner, there are always so many possibilities, but in the expert's, there are few. Do you mount your trophies, Mr. Tavianni? [guests chuckle] So Lochdu Castle's just a base for you for making trips throughout the Highlands? Searching for what, exactly? Oh, I've plans for a big private sports club for the rich and famous. And I'm looking for the right locale with enough land for a golf course. Carl's dreams and ideas are just simply wonderful. [gasps] Why not right here, Carl? [Carl chuckles] Sorry, Kate. Everything I do has to be in a hurry. Up here you'll find the pace gets slower every day. What is this, another one of your games? Well, how was I supposed to know you'd be here? I was cultivating the girl. What're you doing here? We had additional intelligence. Yeah, well, now you've got Morgan, you don't need me anymore, but Charlie, if that fee isn't in the bank by tomorrow, I'll come for you, I swear it. I'm afraid that's not possible. We have one last objective. No, deliver Morgan. That was the deal, no extras. I don't think you're in a position to negotiate, do you? There's a document, a Covenant, and it's hidden in a secret compartment in a silver Bible that once belonged to the late laird of Lochdu Castle. It's been missing since the war. We have reason to believe it's here somewhere. What do you want with it? It's classified. I bet it is. Well, here we are. We thought you'd like adjoining rooms. Yes. Thank you, Kate. That was very thoughtful. [suspenseful music] [fire crackles] I should've known you'd be here. It could take weeks to look through all these. Why would the laird want it hidden? I understand it was out of loyalty to Mountbatten. To his country. This is his country, not England. Same difference. During that particular war, anyway. They told me you took out Norah Bell. I just wanted to say that... I'm sorry that it had to happen because of me. No, I'm sorry. I mean, if I'd been faster about it, you probably wouldn't have been hurt so badly. It's a hell of a thing to kill someone. I can live with it. I know you don't like me. [melancholy music] But thank you. Okay. [phone rings] [fire crackles] [phone rings] [phone rings] Hello. [chuckles] So, old friend. You are working late, huh? And you are up late. Oh, I don't need to sleep at night. I need to be aware of every passing minute. You'll see, when you get older. [chuckles] I hope I will. You have a problem for me? I need more authority from you. You don't even need to ask. Just do whatever you have to do. [Marco speaks Italian] [phone bleeps] [bird squawks] What are you fishing for? Shh. Pike. They keep eating the trout. There's no money in pike. But it's hard to keep them down, now they're established. So much tradition in here. And the land. And the water. All those wonderful things in the castle. You must be very heavily insured. Yes. It's a burden. It's all a burden. Even all the treasures feel like it sometimes. I did the research before I came. There's one thing I'd especially admire to see. Oh, what? The silver Bible. That, for hundreds of years, went to war with your lairds of Lochdu Castle. It was always recovered, even when they died on the field of battle. Must be extremely valuable. Beautiful. [reel clicks] I used to love to play with it when I was a wee one. There was a secret compartment in the cover, and I'd hide things there. Secret messages for Daddy. Or if I'd been naughty and couldn't bear to tell, I'd write out the guilty secret and let him find it there. [chuckles] Yes. Yes. He took it with him when he went away to war. When he came back, he was twisted and burnt and broken. Nothing came back with him. In fact, he didn't really come back, either. The daddy I knew just flew away one day. He's still out there, somewhere. And the Bible's still out there with him. What makes you so especially interested in that Bible, anyway? [Carl chuckles] Just sounds such a beautiful treasure. She's lying! I'll leave you to find out. I have to take care of my own business. Carlo! You are not taking this seriously enough. What the hell do you want me to do, eh? First, talk to Murdoch. It's Stuart Murdoch, is it? Yes. It's blank for the moment, Murdoch. How much you fill it in for, depends on various things. Like what? Like loyalty. And greed. You see, I like greedy people and I think you are one. But you don't get all you want from Her Ladyship, do you? And you never will. Loyalty, greed. What else? I want your eyes and ears. And expressly, a silver Bible, which we think is here, somewhere in the castle. Have you seen it? It's an heirloom, a treasure. Oh, surely Lady Katherine would know better than I? She knows nothing, so it must be hidden somewhere. Discuss it with the servants. Tell them there's a reward if anyone finds it. Very well, what else? Just to show you I mean business. Carlo. Look at this. First class pilot. Expert diver. He worked for the Israelis in Beirut. Sinking PLO boats, apparently. Not choosy, is he, your Mr. Dillon? He's worked for just about everyone. That includes the KGB in the old days. Yeah and he was an enforcer for the provisional IRA. The English seem to be the only people he hasn't worked for. But you know how unscrupulous they are. Maybe he's working for them right now? Oh, he does want to meet you, in order to get an introduction to Don Giovanni. Well, in any case, he was just using me. [brooding music] Were you falling for him? Well, how can I fall for him if I have you? [Carl laughs] [bird squawks] [gravel crunches] Where you going? Just want to explore. I'll drive you. Can we join you? Oh, yes! Mm-hm. Obviously they know as much as we do, and are after the same thing. I suppose you wanna take them all hostage, so we can search the whole place. Or kill them all, preferably. If Don Giovanni says finding the Covenant is vital, it's what we give our whole attention to. That's the man who attacked Asta. And he's still walking? The trouble with you, Carlo, is your desire to be respectable. You've gone soft. In Sicily, we would have sliced his nuts off. You are an animal, Marco. Does an animal defend his daughter's honor? [thuds] [grunts] No, no, please! [thuds] [groans] Please! [thud] [groans] [coughs] [water splashes] [water splashes] [peaceful music] Shit. [tense music] I've lost the brakes! [tires screech] [tires screech] [tires screech] [tires screech] [tires screech] [tires screech] [hood slams] The brake fluid line had been cut. We could've all been killed. It was your stepfather, Morgan. He wants us dead. Why? Why don't you ask him that? We know he's killed already. Whom? Your mother. No. It was an accident. We don't think so. Look, I've been on 100 dives. Your mother was murdered. No. No. He loves me. And he loved my mother. Why would he want to do it? We think she knew too much about him. And we're beginning to be worried about you. What am I to do? Will you help us? Will you keep us informed about him? You want me to inform you on my own stepfather? That's right. [birds tweet] [melancholy piano music] Morning. Hey, Bernstein. [chuckles] How are ya? Didn't sleep much. Is something bothering you? Do you ever have bad dreams? Nope. I sleep like a baby. Lucky you. Tell me something. When you get the Covenant, what're you gonna do with it? Obviously we hand it over to the Prime Minister. After that, it's none of our business. [water splashes] You never knew my father, did you? What exactly is your game, Brigadier? Astute of you to guess. Well, for one thing, you'd surely have been too young. But why did you want to pretend some familiarity? To keep your other tenant at his ease. But you are a brigadier? You do work for the government? In a manner of speaking. And are you also looking for my father's silver Bible? Also? Was Morgan asking you about it? Yes and making quite a big thing of it, too. I've been wondering why. Do you know where it is? It never came back with my father. But why suddenly all this fuss about it? After all, it's been lost nigh on 50 years. Lost? [suspenseful music] Or has it simply never been found? Why, maybe. In a manner of speaking. Here it is. The Covenant? Not quite. My father came back by troop ship and by train. His possessions, his effects, were on a separate movement order. They came back by plane. So what happened to the plane? A crash. In the loch. The big plane went down one night in a storm. When I was about six years old. That could be where the Bible is buried. Down there. [fire crackles] Still. You remember, don't you? Another time. Another body in the water. Yes. Another time. You're about six years of age. There's a storm. Lightning, thunder. [thunder claps] I could hear the sound of the plane. I looked and looked, but the rain made it hard to see. And the lightning's very very scary. [thunder claps] It swooped down over there, right out of sight. I thought it too was afraid and was going to fly away. But it was turning round. Coming in for a new approach. It went down, and down, and down. Like a top, round and round. [explosions roar] Slower. Slower. It was like it was... Sucked in by a whirlpool. There. Right there. Where the shoulder of the hill meets the line of trees. It still is. [helicopter blades whir] Curiouser and curiouser. [fire crackles] [somber orchestral music] What's wrong? [sighs] They are gone. Carl and Marco. Why? They are afraid of being questioned about the murder of that man, Angus. Did they do it? Carl is very possessive about me. And Marco can be an animal. Are you gonna leave him? [hissing] So, what are you going to do when you find it? Find what? [suspenseful music] You don't want to give it to them, do you? [bird squawks] [boat engine hums] [oxygen hisses] [oxygen hisses] [water splashes] [brooding orchestral music] Where the hell is he? [boat engine roars] Sir. [boat engine roars] [boat engine roars] Have you found it? Found what? The Covenant! You were planning to keep it for yourself, weren't you? Give it to me. Now. [water splashes] It's for Morgan, isn't it? Yes, it is. I love him. Mountbatten and Mao both signed this so-called Chungking Covenant. You cannot imagine the power of the Chairman's signature on such a document, even today. And there's no official record of this document? How do you know that your information is correct? That's just the point, Mr. Dillon. I need you to confirm its existence and get it for me. [boat engine hums] [water splashes] [gun fires rapidly] [boat engine roars] [tense music] [boat engine roars] Have you got it? I had it! She's got it! How does she think she's gonna get away? [boat engine roars] [helicopter blades whir] Get down! [gun fires rapidly] [gun fires rapidly] [guns fire rapidly] [bullets ricochet] [gun fires rapidly] [gun fires] [water splashes] [gun fires] [gun fires] [boat engine roars] [tense music] [helicopter blades whir] [gun fires] [guns fire] [gun fires] [Charles groans] Back off! Or I'll finish him off! [Hannah sighs] Get in! [helicopter blades whir] [footsteps clack] [muffled chatter] [footsteps clack] I'm afraid we'll have to forego the tiles for the roof, Stuart. It's all become a bit of a nightmare. Aye. Well, this might help us wake up in a better mood. I can see why Marco doesn't want to be caught in this country. He's rented a citation jet. It's routed to Oslo. But once it leaves our airspace, we have no way of tracking it. He's going to Palermo. Don Giovanni Luca. [brooding orchestral music] What the hell are we gonna do? He has judges killed to order. [Volonti speaks Italian] Senor Volonti, I'm told we can trust you. What do you advise us to do? You know what the situation is like here. Mafia everywhere. And the citation isn't booked to land at Palermo. But surely that's where they're headed? Of course, my friend. Just listen. There's an old farm house in -land at a place call Valdini. They laid rest there last year, probably for drugs. It's grass, but open meadow, about a mile long. That's where the flight plan says Morgan's going. What about customs and immigration? [Volonti scoffs] All taken care of by Luca. Well, can we get to it? It's family country. Every shepherd boy on a hill is like a sentry. Police movements are like troop movements. Impossible. What do you want me to do? Wait till I get to Palermo. [speaks Italian] Okay, ciao. [phone bleeps] [plane engine roars] [tires screech] They arrived at Valdini two hours ago. The plane went to refuel at Puntaraisi. The palace left the airport. We believe Morgan thinks he's safe. Good. All right, give me enough time to get in there, and I wanna see you in the door, all calvary guns blazing. Best of luck. See you there. [plane engine roars] [dramatic orchestral music] Welcome, Mr. Chiang. Proudly delighted, Senor Don Giovanni. I understand you've got something we are looking for? It's Mr. Morgan who did it. Well, Asta played more than her part, too, believe me. And of course, we have another guest. [Giovanni chuckles] The redoubtable mad Charlie Ferguson. A great pleasure. Pleasure's all yours. Lee Ho Chiang? I'm surprised. Seeing you like this rather makes up for having my plans wrecked in England. I always thought of you as a sniveling arse-kisser. I overestimated you. [slap] Why don't you just get it over with? I don't think that's quite what Don Giovanni had in mind. [plane engine roars] [suspenseful music] [distant plane engine roars] What the hell is this? It seems so low. Thought it might land. [gun cocks] It's a capitalist world all over now. I'll put you on the market and I will get some good offers. Perhaps I'd better bid for myself, I'm flattered. Don't be. Any British Intelligence officer as senior as you would satisfy them. They're gonna take the skin off your body, inch by inch. Don Giovanni, where is the Covenant? Yes, Carlo, the Covenant. Asta, you do the honors. The Chungking Covenant. [Giovanni chuckles] Imagine the trouble I can make with this, huh? Ah, ah, ah. [chuckles] Now that you know it exists, you're going to have to pay me plenty. [grenade clacks] [explosion booms] [footsteps clack] Charlie! Sean! Put that gun down, Dillon. Or I'll serve his brains up on your shoes. Put it down. Now! [wood clacks] I wonder what you are worth on the open market, Dillon. Your friends with Mr. Borga in Caresha would pay handsomely. Let me kill him now. I'll match any offer! Did you tell him about us? What? What're you talking about? She's playing you. She's settin' you up. She cut the brakes on our car and she told us you did it. Yes, I did. I did it to get information. I had to give them a reason to believe that I would turn against you. I did it for you. Your mother. Did you do that for him? What do you mean? If she had a bad air tank, why wasn't Asta's tank contaminated as well? Shut up. It was filled at the same time, the same dive shop. I've got the receipt. Asta picked up the tank! [suspenseful music] Her convulsions were so violent, her skull was shattered. No. You didn't. That's not... I- It's not true, is it? Is it? I tried to tell you. She did not love you. My mother, she did horrible things. I loved you, I always- There was one woman I loved, and you killed her. But I love you. I did it all for you. You are mad. I love you. I love you. I love you. [gun fires] [bodies clunk] [gun fires] [gun fires] [guns fire rapidly] [Volonti yells in Italian] [guns fire rapidly] [guns fire rapidly] The Covenant, where is it? [distant guns fire rapidly] I never thought I would see the day. They won't believe he's gone in Palermo. You oughta put him in an open coffin in a store window, like they did in the Old West. [Volonti chuckles] [plane engine roars] [seagulls squawk] Mr. Ferguson, the Prime Minister- Brigadier. Sorry? I'm Brigadier Ferguson. If you plan to address me formally again. Yes, of course. I'm Roland Lesaux with the PM's internal security unit. He sends his apologies but he's unable to see you right at this moment. He wanted me to report personally, the moment I was back with the Covenant. Yes, you've been traveling. You evidently haven't heard. Foreign Minister Chao Lin died this morning. The document's usefulness is questionable until the new regime is clarified. So, if you'll leave it with me, I'll- I'm sorry, Lesaux, I'm not empowered to hand it over to anyone below ministerial rank. Anyway, it's perfectly safe with me. [peaceful orchestral music] He's got a girlfriend here, is that it? The niece of quite a high-powered player. Someone we probably ought to be cultivating. Oh, what better way? [suspenseful music] [footsteps clack] Move. Down there into the alley. Don't do this, someone else- Shut up and move. Don't do it to yourself. Dillon! Do you love her? Say goodbye. Go ahead and do it. Okay. [flesh squelches] [gun clunks] "An eye-witness reported that the murderer of Asta Morgan was a white middle-aged male. Although certain developments suggest otherwise." Terrible tragedy, that. Well, I must congratulate you, Mr. Dillon, on your successful acquisition of the Covenant. Well, thank you but the brigadier and the inspector were instrumental. [plane engine roars] [speaks foreign language] Safe journey! Take care of her. How long will you be gone? In Hong Kong? How long it takes to make the best deal for our people out there. Would the Covenant have been of use to you? Of course. I could've used it to bargain with. Made a deal to free the dissidents, perhaps. But you've given it to your government. I don't think they appreciate the trouble it took to get it. I think you'd better have it. [brooding music]
