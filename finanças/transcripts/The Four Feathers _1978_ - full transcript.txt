[trumpet tune] [dramatic instrumental music] [dramatic music] [somber music] - If I were the French army, I'd flank your left and collapse the whole brigade. Protect it for your calvary. Good, good. Now which regiment do you hold? - Ours, sir. - Which his ours? - David. He's not one of your leftenants. - The more he knows now, the better. Are you ready, dear? Shall we go? - Yes, dear. Show your father the picture you drew. [chuckling] - That's no uniform I know. [laughing] - [Wife] He's drawn you. - Not in that uniform. That's no regiment I know. Study the uniforms, Harry. [military drumming] [somber music] [thunder rumbling] Harry? Harry! You've been sent to bed. [thunder rumbling] - Can I light my candle, father? - To bed. [enchanting music] [thunder rumbling] Harry. [thunder rumbling] - The troops were paraded, always ready. You could see the Russian on the hilltops. He was waiting, we were waiting. At that moment, before the first shot, before the order to advance, in those hours a man ages years. The minutes ooze by. - Nonsense. It's a good time to study the terrain. See where the pits are. The rocks. - And say your prays. [men laughing] - I remember those moments of waiting at Sevastopol, how they broke a man down. Wilmington. - Disgraceful coward. - The man trembled all the while we waited and then refused the order to advance. Refused. Ruined him, of course. - Sneak back to London like a whipped dog. All doors will closed to him. Finally had the decency to shoot himself. All this talk of cowards put me off my port. [laughing] - Good port it is. - Gentlemen, a toast. To the General and his hospitality. And to the youngest Feversham. May Harry serve his country as well as all the other Fevershams before him. General. - [Man] To General Feversham. Harry. [ominous music] [dramatic music] [exciting music] - I refuse. I can't follow that. Bloody saber's apart of your arm. If we ever see any action, I'm going to be just behind you and let you clear the path for me. - I doubt if we'll ever see action. - What about Egypt? The Dervish rebellion spreading. Do you smell that? It's war, man. War is in the wind. - That's the stable, Jack. [laughing] No, it's a peacetime crew ahead. That's why I'm resigning. - Of course you are. You're always bloody resigning. - This time I am. - I'll believe that when you go before the old General and tell him his son has decided to become a civilian. "What?! "A Feversham a civilian?! "Unthinkable! "Uniform's all wrong." - I will, Jack. I'll do it this time. I'm getting married. - Ethne? - Yes. - You've asked her and she said yes? - Yes, I thought she might have written to you. She intends to. [yelling] [suspenseful music] - Bravo, Harry! But you'll a hole in the North Surrey and you'll miss so much. I wish you both the very best. - Thank you, Jack. Wait. [pleasant music] The summer house. [giggling] You owe me a shilling. You said it wouldn't rain. - A lady can be wrong. [thunder rumbling] - We could be trapped here all day. - I'm not going to miss our engagement ball. My engagement present? - Do you like it? - Yes. Will your father be coming to give his blessing? - No. - You told him you're leaving the army. - I wrote him. - Harry. - I'll see him when it's finished. So he can't. There will be nothing he can do. - I told you. I'll be a soldier's wife. - No. - A regimental wedding. - I'm finished with the regiment. - Walking beneath an archway of swords. The officer and his lady. - Can we stop talking about the army? - I don't understand you, Harry. You're the best officer in the Royal North Surrey. You and Jack Durrance. - Let Jack lead the glorious charges. - And now this talk of war in Egypt. - No, thank you. Not for me. [dramatic music] - I don't understand you. - Then don't. Just love me. [dramatic music] - Jack! You're the first. Welcome. - Hello. - Always so punctual, these army chaps. - Mmmm. Been practicing for the country life? - Dreadful long hours, Jack. Re-valley at noon. Then we have the inspection of the flowers, the fruit trees, the lawns, the checking of the wine cellar, the flogging of the servants, the exercising of the horses, the-- - Shut up. [laughing] [pleasant instrumental music] - Colonel and Mrs. Eustace. I present my brother officers, Captain William Trench. - How do you do? - How do you do? Sir. - [Colonel] Good evening. - And Mr. Thomas Willoughby. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? - Oh and both so splendid looking. I wanted Harry to wear his uniform just once more. - Threatened him with arrest but it's not good threatening a civilian. - Well he isn't a civilian yet, sir. Harry, we must have a talk. - Where is your fiance, then, Harry? - She's in the music room with some friends. - Will you excuse us, please? Mrs. Eustace, sir. - Sir. - Egypt, Harry, the Sudan. The North Surrey is certain to be called. - My resignation becomes official tomorrow. - We could be called out at any time. - There are always rumors of war. - You couldn't stay behind if you were called. - Rumors, Tom. I'm not going to change my plans because of rumors in the mist. - It's in the bloody papers. These Dervishes, they're fanatics. They're just spoiling for their holy war. - I become a civilian tomorrow. Six months from now you'll still be in England grumbling, waiting for war to break out on the South Pole. Now come and drink and dance. Forget your soldiers for one night. - That's easier for some. - Oh, come on, Will, it's the man's engagement party. - All right, Feversham. Lead me to the brandy. - At the far table. Quick march. [pleasant piano music] [upbeat instrumental music] [upbeat instrumental music] - For you and the other officers of the regiment, sir. Marked, "Urgent." [upbeat instrumental music] [applauding] - Thank you, I'll see to these. - Yes, sir. [people chattering] [joyous instrumental music] [clock ticking] [joyous instrumental music] - Ah, looking for you, Harry. Where's? Are you all right? - Yes. - I can't find your Ethne. It's my dance with her. - Come. Come, Tom, we'll find her. [fire crackling] [steam hissing] - Wembol's here. - Isn't that the Sergeant Major with him? - Welcome back, sir. - Gentlemen. - Oh, a carriage. Well done, Jack. - Captain Trench, sir. - Sergeant Major. - I must inform you and the other officers, sir, you're reporting two days late. - What? - Regiment's been called, sir. - Called? Well then why weren't we informed? - Wembol knew where we were. - It was all telegraphed, sir. - We certainly were not. - Better hurry, sir. - Yes. Carry on, Sergeant Major. - Sir. - Egypt? - Yes, sir. - You hear that? Egypt. - Feversham burned them. - What? - I saw Feversham burning several envelops in the fireplace the night of the ball. They looked like telegrams. - Oh, Harry. - [William] But why would he do it? - So he could say he had no word of the alert. So he could leave the regiment. - Well he's dishonored himself and he's dishonored Royal North Surreys, damn him. - What a low thing to do. Can you believe it? - Coward! And I shall tell him so myself. - Harry! Harry, have you heard? North Surreys have been called to Egypt. Well? Have you rejoined? - Rejoined? I'm out of it forever. - Well I thought and father thought that you changed your mind now. - Why? To go and fight the Dervishes for the glory of the Empire? To plant the flag in the Sudan? - Don't make a joke about it, Harry. - I want to be with you. - Excuse me, Miss Ethne. There's been an urgent delivery for Mr. Feversham. A package. - Where is it, Carson? - On the table in the garret, Miss Ethne. - Thank you, well get it. [clock chiming] What is it? [ominous music] Jack Durrance? Willoughby? Trench? Is this an ugly joke? Feathers of cowardice for you? For what? For resigning? This is an outrage. They must take them back. - [Harry] For desertion in the face of the enemy. - What enemy? We weren't at war when you resigned. - Yes. During our party. Telegrams came for all the officers present. I knew the regiment had been alerted. - But you? - I burnt them so I could resign. [dramatic music] - How could you do such a thing? - I didn't want to go. - You didn't want? As a solider you had no choice, Harry, no choice. - I wanted to be with you. - I told you I want to be a soldier's wife. - No, I don't want that for us. - You want? You want. Can you only think about what Harry Feversham wants? - Please, Ethne. - And now you want, you want me to support you. I have to turn my back on family, regiment, the country. - What has that to do with us? - It is us. It is, it's in our blood, it's what we are. And all along you've decided to throw it all away without even a word. [dramatic piano music] Then you live alone with that decision, Harry Feversham. Take it. Please, take it and go away. Leftenant Feversham. Best officer in the North Surreys. [dramatic music] I thought we had no secrets. None. Wait! Here. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] - Would you wait over there, please? - [Driver] Go! Giddy-up! - [Man] Evening, sir. - Good evening. - Will you be staying, sir? - No, John. Is my father at home? - Just back from the troop reviews, sir. Shall I tell him? - No, thank you. - Very good, sir. [somber music] [knocking] - I can never tell if it's a slight draft of if it's my son opening that door. Now that you've sneaked in, you can sneak out. No need to bring me the news. You've resigned and your regiment is off for Egypt. All London knows my humiliation. Leave me now. - Father? That's not all. These. - I must ask for satisfaction! - Satisfaction? - Call them out, man! This is a scandal! - I deserve them. I knew about the alert before I resigned. I said nothing. [thudding] [glass shattering] - I knew you were weak. I knew. - Yes, you knew! You always knew! So why are you so surprised, father, and beating about with your cane? You knew. You tell me stories of cowards in battle. You knew those stories were my nightmares. You heard me crying up there, alone with my nightmares. Didn't you hear me? I would sink my teeth into the pillow to catch my cries. And still they came out and you heard them. Didn't you?! - Lower your voice. Oh dear God. Out of my sight! You will not return to this house ever. You will not return. [door slamming] [crowd commotion] [military band music] [crowd cheering] [military drumming] [piano tune] [military band music] [piano keys ringing] [military band music] [cheering] - Good luck, my boy. - Thank you. Thank you for coming to see me off. - Look after yourself. [women crying] - Where's Jack? - I need more of a kiss to last me through Egypt. I care for you, Ethne, I always have. I love you. - Harry is dead to me, Jack. But I feel like his widower. I feel I should mourn him awhile. And you should give me time. - Will you write to me? - Yes. - Hurry up! Fill the trains! Say goodbye, soldier. Come on, get a move on! Pick up that rifle. Come on, hurry up! Hurry up, get on the train! - I'll bring you back the head of a Dervish, sir. - Bring me a basket full. Good luck. - Jack! Take care. - Care? Let the Dervish take care. - [Mr. Eustace] Bravo. [whistle blowing] [military band music] [train whistle blowing] [train chugging] [ominous music] - [Father Voiceover] Finally, he had the decency to shoot himself. [ominous music] [clicking] [whistle blowing] [train horn blowing] - I'm bound for Egypt! [train chugging] [crowd commotion] [exotic Egyptian music] [people chattering in foreign language] You are Abou Fatma? My name is Harry Feversham. I've been looking for you. - Why? - You know the people of the Sudan. You move among the Mahdi and his rebels. I want to be able to move freely among them. - Sit. Why have you chosen me for your education, Mr. Feversham? - You scout for the British, I've seen you. You bring information to the officers of the North Surreys. I've been watching you for many weeks and I want to serve with you. - This Mahdi came to me three years ago. He wanted my people to fight with him. I told him to leave us in peace and for this refusal, he took my hand. But I have another. And with this, I wage my humble war against the pretender who calls himself Mahdi. Now, English man, why do you make war? Why? - Because I've been a coward. [chuckling] - At least an honest coward. Mr. Feversham, what do you intend to do? - Make three of my brother officers take back these. - But there are four. - May I serve with you? [horn blowing] [hooves thundering] [men yelling] [horn tune blowing] [horse hooves rumbling] - Parade! Attention! - A Dervish army is reported on the march near Tokar. Before we can fight them, we must find them. This we intend to do. Reconnaissance groups of horse, camel and foot contingents will move out in six hours. The Royal North Surrey Regiment will provide infantry columns to probe the plains west of the mountains. Gentlemen, good hunting. [ominous music] [boots stomping] - Sergeant Major. - Sir! - Fall out! - Shall I give the order for the men to drink? - No. - But it's been hours. - Steady. Let's see if we have news of the well. Straighten up a bit. - I feel as if I'm melting. - Just don't fall off your horse. It looks damned undignified. - Afraid the well is dry, sir. - Then there's no point in marching to it, is there? - No, sir. I thought the same. - Any sign of the enemy? - Not a sign, sir. - Very well, we'll camp here. Let the native scouts know, Sergeant Major. - Sir! Sergeant Major says we'll camp here for the night. Tomorrow you will lead us to the next well. [speaking foreign language] - Will he fortify the camp? - Only with brush. They're too hot and tired to dig a trench and Jack will let them rest. - But he will send out patrols. - Guards will be posted but only inside the brush. - Then we will move to higher ground. There. Where we may better watch over your friend. - He won't need much watching tonight. No sign of the Dervishes. - You have still much to learn, Mr. Feversham. [crickets chirping] [horses neighing] - [Jack Voiceover] You best pack a bag, dear Ethne. For I shall dream you here tonight. Needn't bring much. Just yourself and a chilled bottle of-- [flute playing somber tune] - Do you hear that? - Pardon, sir? [crickets chirping] [somber music] [ominous music] [gasping] - The Dervish. When I brought them I heard nothing. - How many? - Some hundreds surrounding the British. They will close the circle slowly. Come. [horse neighing] Right towards the garrison. There will be a mounted patrol. Look for their dust in the sky. Bring them, I will warn the British. - Abou! I must warn my friend. - You will have to ride through the Dervish, Mr. Feversham. - Yes. [ominous music] [foreboding music] Stand to! [gunshot booming] - Sound alarm! [gunshots booming] [trumpet blowing] [Dervishes yelling] - Move back! [yelling] Check your ammunition, wait for it. [Dervishes hollering] - Company! Ready! Commence fighting by command! [hollering] - Ready! [gunshots booming] [yelling] [booming] [hollering] - Present! [gunshots booming] Present! Fire! [gunshots booming] [barking orderings] - Form a square! - Form a square! Come on, Rollins! [gunshots booming] [Dervishes hollering] Ready! Fire! [gunshots booming] Present! Fire! [gunshots booming] - Present! Fire! [gunshots booming] Present fire! [booming] [hollering] Right present! Fire! [gunfire commotion] [men yelling] [yelling] We're going to the rocks! Ready! [groaning] [gagging] [gunshots booming] [grunting] [booming] Fire! [gunshots booming] Down here! [gunshots booming] [men yelling] [dramatic music] Fire. [gunshots popping] [suspenseful music] [booming] [booming] [yelling] [gasping] [booming] [groaning] [suspenseful music] I can't see. [groaning] I can't see! [men yelling in foreign language] [thudding] [speaking in foreign language] [ominous music] [foreboding music] [flies buzzing] [somber music] - Water. No, don't! - Bradley? Sergeant Major? - They're all dead, Jack. - Who are you? - It's me. Harry. - Harry Feversham? Oh my God. Am I dead? - No, Jack. - Why, Harry? Why have you come here? - To help you somehow. So I could give you this. [crickets chirping] - Oh, God. Yes, I take it back. - Leave it. - No, I want to see you. - They're burnt, Jack. Let them heal. [sighing] - Will I see you again, Harry? - Them them heal. - The North Surrey's fought well. Did the Dervish take the colors? - They killed everyone, Jack. 50 men and lost hundreds themselves. - Did they take the colors? - Yes, the took the blood flag. - We'll get it back. - You'll go to England. You'll take the feather. - Yes, I'll keep it. - No, take it to Ethne. [dramatic music] - Harry, you're dead to Ethne. - I'm going to give each one of them back. And one day, her's too. [horse neighing] Listen. The relief column. Jack. Call to them when they're close by. - And you? - Let me stay just a shadow, Jack. Except to you and to Ethne. [horses neighing] - Harry? About Ethne. Harry? [horses huffing] Harry?! Harry! - "And now I no not what to say to you. "Father is trying to sway Parliament "towards an all out campaign "to retake the Sudan. "I'm sure he fancies himself "leading it on a great white horse "with you at his side. "I am against it, for I want you home, Jack, "so that I can repeat the following in person. "Yes, oh yes, I will be your wife. "I put all indecision behind me. "All doubts, all of my past, "all of my ghosts. "Finish with your Dervish and your glory "and come home to England and to Ethne. "We wait to welcome you. "Will all my love, Ethne." [rain pitter-pattering] - We formed a somewhat hasty line. Volley fire. And they came at us through the smoke, screaming. We formed a square. I saw at least two of them go down and right up again. Couldn't stop them. - Enough. Must we talk of war? - We ran for the rocks. Flying column. Bayonets fixed. And I was the lucky one. I was shot. Fell among the boulders. Hidden unconscious. I was the lucky one. - Three steps. - Was that a shooting star? - I didn't see it. - Sometimes I see light. They tell me it's only memory, phantom lighting. I really believe I see it. - Perhaps there's still a chance then. - Yes. Ethne, your letter caught up with me in a field hospital on the Nile. A nurse read it to me. The letter where you agreed to be my wife. - A nurse? I hope she gave you the proper feeling. - You wrote it to a different man. - Jack, don't. - A whole man. I don't hold you to that letter. - No letter holds me, Jack. My feelings hold me. [dramatic music] - You should run from me. - I did run once. From a man who loved me and needed me. I failed him. Now life has given me another chance. I want this chance. And I want you. [dramatic music] I'll never fail you, Jack. - Officers coming. - If he deserts the Mahdi, then we've broken the Dervish grip on this territory. Or so I'm told. - You trust him? - Well, he's come to talk on our ground. - This isn't exactly our ground. We're far outside the zone. - Yes, the meeting place wasn't my idea but you know the Colonel as well as I do. "There's nowhere in the Empire "the Queen's uniform can't go." [sheep bleating] [faint exotic music] - Okay. - Another bodyguard of Omdurman. - That's the third one. Your information must've been correct. - Yes. It's going to be today. I hope your friend realizes the danger he is in. [people chattering in foreign language] - How do you do? [people chattering] We shall have to do this the old way. [people chattering] [ominous music] - Willoughby! [suspenseful music] [gunshots booming] [fighting commotion] [men yelling] [suspenseful music] [men yelling] [groaning] - You! You spoke my name. - Yes, Tom. [pleasant piano music] - Miss Eustace, I was your guest here almost a year ago. - Yes. Well you may dance at still another of my engagement parties. Captain Durrance and I are to be married. Though we've not yet set a date. - Jack Durrance? I didn't realize. I've just arrived from Cairo. - If you hope to find Jack here, I'm afraid he's back in London. - I've come to see you, actually and to deliver this. - How did you come by that? - From him. He turned up in Suakin, of all places. Risked his life to save mine. I thought he should be decorated but he said, "Just take back your damn feather "and delivery it to Ethne. "She knows." - I know? - He means to give them all back. All three. - Four. [somber music] All four feathers. Oh dear God, Harry. - You wouldn't recognize him. I took him for a native. He's... I'm sorry, shall I leave you? - Did he say anything else? - No. - Something? - I saw him for just a few moments. [dramatic music] - Shall I ever see him? - If he lives. He's gone to find Trench and Trench is a prisoner in Omdurman. - Omdurman? - It's in the very heart of the Dervish Empire. Just getting there would be a miracle. I told him that. Well, I'll be leaving now. - Yes. Thank you, Captain. You'll be seeing Jack in London? - Yes. - Don't speak of Harry Feversham. Please. - Goodbye then. [dramatic music] - So he's after regaining his honor. His name. There's still a spark in him. He's still a Feversham. - Stop it, please. He's a tormented man. We drove him away. - I doubt if a woman could understand. - Please, General. He came to each of us and we sent him away, closed our doors to him. His father and the woman he loved. It is our shame. Not his. - He was a soldier and there is a soldier's code. - Is there a father's code? - Aren't we by the shrub roses? - Yes. - We must be finished. [somber piano music] - Well listen to that. - It's been a good while since she played. [somber piano music] - Will you excuse me? - Can I help you? - No, thank you. [pleasant piano music] [door opening] It's been a long time since you've played. - Yes. My fingers are a bit stiff. - It's lovely. Go on. I'll sit here. - I hear a captain of your regiment is back in London. - Willoughby. Yes, I met him. - Did he have any news? - News? No. Oh yes, yes. Poor Trench. A prison in Omdurman. Probably dead by now. - Is that a terrible place, Omdurman? - A nightmare, so I'm told. Play. - Yes. While you were in Suakin, did ever... Did you ever hear word of Harry Feversham? - Feversham? - I hear he may have gone to Egypt. - No, I never saw him. [pleasant piano music] [piano music mutes] [children hollering] [chains rattling] - So, there. We will slip out of the line there and go down that alley. - Yes. There will be horses at the end of the street, tools to break off chains and guns at the Oasis of Sudan. One day's ride. - So all that's left is for me to be arrest. I hope I shall see you again, Abou Fatma. - I'll be waiting at the end of the street. It's as sure as the sand. [flute music] [flute music] [thudding] [groaning] [people groaning] [chains rattling] [men grunting in foreign language] - Fight to stay alive. Fight. Don't move. Fight. Fight to stay up! Fight to stay alive. Don't think of the stench. Fight to stay alive. - Trench. - Stand up. Fight to stand up. - Trench. - Stay up. - Look at me. Trench! Look at me. Trench! - Trench? - Captain William Trench. - Captain William Trench. - Remember? Remember, damn it! Remember me. - Feversham? Feversham. - Yes. [crying] [men speaking in foreign language] - Keep moving. Get to the front. [men speaking in foreign language] [grunting] Get to the water. [men speaking in foreign language] [splashing] [chains clinking] Don't sleep yet, Harry. I want to hear it again. Tell me again. - On the march back from work, I'll show you the alley today. In six days, we'll slip out of the line somehow and we're going down the alley. My friend will be waiting there. - Could you trust him? - As I trust myself. - If he's not there, they'll catch us and they send us back here. And I don't think I could stand up anymore. I've been standing up for seven months, Harry. [pleasant music] - [Ethne Voiceover] There's a package for you, Harry. White feathers? For what? You burned, burned the telegram? You were that much afraid. I am so sorry. Let me hold you. Yes. Just hold on to me. Stay with me. [dramatic music] [baby crying] [chains clinking] [men yelling in foreign language] - Abou's work. [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [men speaking in foreign language] [whip cracking] [suspenseful music] He's not there. - Where is he? [ominous music] [yelling in foreign language] Horses! The horses! - Feversham! Feversham, we must leave! [men yelling in foreign language] - [Trench] Our chains! - [Abou] No time now! [crowd yelling] - [Harry] Hurry, Trench, hurry! [gunshot booming] [suspenseful music] [yelling in foreign language] [yelling in foreign language] [hooves rumbling] [suspenseful music] [yelling in foreign language] [suspenseful music] [crowd commotion] [hooves rumbling] [horses huffing] - How much further to the oasis? - Another eight hours. If they don't catch us, Mr. Trench. [somber music] [horse neighing] - Harry! [ominous music] - Leave it. Mount behind me. Go on! Go on! [horses neighing] - If they catch us, Harry, you must kill me. - [Abou] Mount! - You must. - Mount! [ominous music] The oasis! [dramatic music] Give me the ammunition, quickly! - Trench. [clinking] - Come on! [gunshot booming] [clinking] [horse hooves galloping] [booming] [clinking] [gunshots booming] - They won't get me back there now, Harry. [gunshot booming] [yelling in foreign language] [guns clicking] [gunshots booming] [suspenseful music] [booming] [groaning] - Back! [booming] [groaning] [booming] [booming] [dramatic music] - The three. We... We... [ominous music] - We're free, Harry. [dramatic music] - No, I'll do it. You read me the news. - Very well, sir. What should we have, sir? - The races. - Here's a dispatch from the Sudan, sir. - Good. - It's Captain Trench, sir. - Will? What does it say? - "Captain William Trench of the Royal North Surrey Regiment "arrived March 2nd in Cairo, "after his recent escape from Dervish prison in Omdurman." - Bravo, Trench. - "He was aided in his escape by a civilian, "an Englishman, who entered the prison "in order to free the officer. "The man was identified as--" - Harry Feversham. - "Formally an officer in the Royal North Surrey." How did you know, sir? [dramatic music] - All the feathers are gone now, Harry. All but one. - Pardon, sir? - Is there anything else there? - Just that the men are returning at London, sir. The dispatch is a week old. [dramatic music] - I want to see her. - Sir? - I was supposed to meet Miss Eustace today. - Yes, sir. - Get word to her that I would like her to come here, to visit me here. - I'm going now, sir. - Yes. [horse hooves clapping] [church bell ringing] [horses neighing] - It's her, sir. - What's she wearing? - A purple dress, sir. Silk, I think. - A hat? - Purple, sir. - Is everything in its place? - Yes, sir. - Leave now, Wembol. - Sir. [knocking] - Let me guess, it's the girl from the laundry. - I can't fool a fine gentlemen like yourself, sir. And why didn't you come meet me in the gardens? Where's Wembol? - Wembol is out. I function very well on my own now, dear lady. That's part of my news. - News? - Stand here in the window light. - What is it? - Purple. The color of your dress. It's very dim but I do see it. It is purple, isn't it? - Jack. That's wonderful. - I've known for days but I had to be sure. I've been consulting with Parker and the German specialist. - And? [somber music] - I'm going away. Germany. Long series of treatments and operations. - Jack, what? - You have been a great treasure to me, Ethne. But I have to chase this possibility. I may be chasing it for years. And it's going to take over my life for awhile. It's best that I remain free. I should never have committed us to the marriage. [dramatic music] - Are you sure? - I believe that it is best for both of us. - Leaving so soon. - Yes. Don't come and see me off. I wouldn't be able to say all this again. [dramatic music] [paper rustling] - I do love you, Jack. - I know. And I love you. Now, please. Back to the park. Walk among the gardens in your purple dress and I'll think of you there. I'll see you there. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] - Master Harry, sir. - John. - So good to see you, sir. - Is the General in his study? - Yes, sir. Shall I tell him? - No, thank you. [footsteps clicking] [knocking] [door closing] - Well, you are expecting me to be waiting at the front entrance, waving and embracing, I suppose. - No, I didn't expect that. - Huh? Well you did do wrong by the name you carry. That's a fact. But I believe you have redeemed yourself and I forgive you. - I haven't come to be forgiven. - What is it, then? Praise? I'll not praise you for behaving like a soldier. That was expected from the start. - Not praise, either. Praise for what? For risking the life that wasn't worth keeping? No, I came to see you, father. To look at you. To find out what I feel. - What do you feel? - All the terror of you is gone. There's not much else between us, is there? There never was. - You were born to a soldier. Cry about it if you wish. They're going to offer you a commission in the North Surrey. A captaincy. - I refused. My sons and daughters will not be born to a solider. Goodbye, sir. - This is your house. - Is it? - Yes, by God. Been empty as death for a long time now. Perhaps. - Perhaps we'll get to know each other now. [door closing] [enchanting music] - Excuse me, Miss Ethne, there's a gentleman. - Captain Trench. - Yes. - Well? Give it to me. I thought he had come. - He has. He told me to tell you he'll wait for awhile in the summer house. If you don't come, well he'll understand. [pleasant music] [dramatic music] [rain trickling] [footsteps thumping] - It rained the last time, didn't it? - I know you never wanted to see me again. But I had to give you this. - Oh, Harry! You can't give it to her because she isn't here. That awful girl that gave you the white feather. She's gone, Harry. Gone forever. [dramatic music] [pleasant piano music] [whooshing]
