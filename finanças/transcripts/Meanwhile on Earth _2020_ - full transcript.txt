Shall we start here? - You take that one and I'll take this. - Alright. - Hello. - Hey there. We're looking forward to unsettled weather this weekend with lots of rain. Inner Norrland will see some snow. The best chance for sun will be in Lapland. And now a forecast until Sunday evening. South and northeast Götaland and Öland cloudy and chances of precipitation. South Skåne, Blekinge, and the coast of Småland may see some sun. Tonight 12-6 degrees, tomorrow afternoon rain from west and 7-11 degrees. Count on precipitation in northwest Götaland and southeast Svealand. Sunday afternoon wind from northwest and the clouds start to break up. Tonight 1-4 degrees, tomorrow 3-7. Bless you. We need to get that valve fixed. We can see to it later. - They're bringing the lift already at 1 pm. - Right. - We'll have to see to it tomorrow. - Yes. - I'll bring in the last two. - Yep. Thank God it's Friday. Long weekend as well. Right, you're off on Monday. Lucky you. - That's nice. - Really nice. And your missus has the day off as well. It's a good day to be home. - Yeah. We're taking a trip to Trelleborg. - Alright, OK. - Do you often go to Trelleborg? - No. - Only if we need something. - Of course. - The closest supermarket is there. - Alright. Is it a big one? - Ica Maxi in Trelleborg is pretty good. - Alright. OK. I never go to Trelleborg... I never used to go there, but now that she lives down there... - Of course, you go to the closest one. - Right. Right... I wonder... What the... I think we need to change the sheets. Is she the one that has been bleeding? - No, it's a leaking chest drain, I think. - Then we'll change. - But there's one more, right? - The skin is very fragile. - We'll have to wait with this one. - We'll keep this patient on the stretcher. We'll take care of that when we've finished. There's one more that needs changing. Right... - So there's no one left in there? - Yes, one. I think. Yes. - Is it the one from Lund? - No. - I've already handled that one. - OK. Right, that one. - Let's put this one in there. - Aren't we changing? Yes, my bad. Should we bring this one in as well? - We'll put this in there too. - Alright. Since we need this space. Let's see if we can find a patient in the storage instead. Exactly. - I ate at a buffet yesterday. - At the Chinese place? - You're a bit of a pig, aren't you? - It was great. I can imagine. But I got so damn full. You eat like there's no tomorrow. Why do you always eat so damn much at a buffet? Because you're afraid you won't get your money's worth. - It's the greediness in human nature. - Yes. I think 79 kronor is cheap. - Yes, and then you eat for three. - Exactly. I had the fried banana for dessert. It's so damn good. I think most of us function that way. The value gives a sense of satisfaction. The value of paying 79 kronor and eating as much as you want. - And you try to maximize it. - Yes, that's true. Almost everybody thinks like that. It's like winning the lottery and then shopping like crazy. - I wouldn't know. I've never won anything. - You haven't, right? Money, no. - Maybe 10 kronor here and there... - Right. I don't buy that. Goodness me... - Look at those guys. - Just honk and drive. Here's a little pick-me-up. - Here you go, Saga. - No, I don't want any. - Alright, cheers. - It's good. - I went fishing yesterday. - Is that so? Yes, Ahmed and I biked to Limhamn and fished for Northern pike. And of course, Ahmed caught the most fish. You know he got Johanna's fishing gear. So I had to take him fishing. I only want a small piece. Bring the rest home with you. The dog can't eat it and Karin has diabetes... - I'll give you a small one. - Just a small piece. One orange. Robin, they're done. - They're at the last prayer. - Great. Why is he backing in there? Maybe he thinks it's in here. He sees us and thinks it's here, but it isn't. Call him instead. Call him. Why is he doing that? I mean, come on. He thinks they're done since we're standing here. Robin here. There are still people inside, so wait a bit. We're waiting on the other side. Yes, that's why I called. There are still people inside. They're at the last prayer. They should be done in 5 minutes. They've done the soil part and everything. Yeah, perfect. We tried waving at you. Alright, sounds good. Great, bye. - He got it? - Yes. - He didn't see us. - I understood as much. I was wondering why he started driving. I thought he would see us waving, but nope. - Whoopsadaisy. - Oh-oh. Let's see... - Do we need one of these? - It's probably best. - I'll remove... flowers and stuff... - Do we have any sheets left? - Yes, they're out there. - That's good. Whoops. - So we haven't run out yet. - No. - What was I saying...? - I don't know. No, me neither. I don't dare touch this. Her skin is super fragile. Should we get... the bin for the sheets. Poor thing, I can see that. This does not look great. - We should turn her instead of lifting. - That's probably best. I don't dare to use any sharp ropes on her. - Let's try gently removing her shirt. - Yes, absolutely. - Must be a lot of cortisone and stuff... - Exactly. - Jesus, they're really been tearing here... - Ouch. We need to be careful. Receive the Lord's blessing. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face toward you, and give you peace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Then I'll have that. - It's 125 kronor. Sole with remoulade. - I'll have the sole with remoulade. - Alright. And some salad and bread? - Yes. Hello Malin, it's Jan Thunell. How's it going? You didn't float off in the ran? - Hi there, Scanian! Greetings from Bågen. - Hello, Bågen. What was that? Yes. Yes, that's clever. Otherwise, you'll need to put the rainhat on. Listen, I visited Saga just now and the bathroom sink is jammed. I cleaned the trap, but it didn't work, so I removed the tailpiece and it was completely stuffed. So I flushed it with water down the toilet. And then it worked, but... I can only think of two reasons for it to jam like that. Either Saga washes too many socks in the sink or the cleaning staff empty their dirty water there. I've tried to explain... Yes. I've tried to talk to Saga about it. She just says that nobody cares about the elderly anymore. I've tried to explain to her that if she wants laundry done she needs to put it in the laundry basket, and not try to wash old shirts and... Washing them will only cause a lot of lint. It would be nice with a longer trip. I thought I was going to Croatia. - That would have been nice. - It sure would. - Four days down south. - Damn nice. - These long trips are really fun. - Yes, they are. There's no time pressure like when we work around here. Even when you drive to Helsingborg or Ängelholm, you feel the pressure. When you get a trip to Stockholm you have the time it takes. Or a trip to Oslo. Or like when we went to Finland. That trip was damn nice. I'd like to do that again. It was a blast. - Just the ferry, it's so crazy. - Yes, the ferry to Finland? Yeah, it was really nice. Entertainment, troubadours... So much fun. - And you sleep well too. - Yes. - Yes, you sleep well in hotels. - Oh, yes. - Did it feel awkward? - No, it works. So you can start from there? And... A short delay on the "buff", all three times but particularly on the third. - So you sense the ending. - Right. I'm sorry, my niece's daughter is at Gatwick on her way home... And some idiots have... She's my godchild. She's 17, and has been studying in London and now she's on her way home. I've promised to pick her up at the airport, but some loonies have been flying drones over Gatwick so it's all closed. - So she can't get home? - No. Alright... Oh my... Gosh. - How old is she? - She's 17. Her parents are in Thailand, and she was supposed to go there tomorrow with her older brother. What bad luck. - At least it's softer now. - Yes. - So we don't have to struggle with that... - The power drill? - So you're a grass widower now? - Yup. - Is it nice? - At least it's quiet. - Just you and the dog. - Yes, there's some work with the dog. She has problems with her eyes and needs eye drops. She's got three different types of medicine that she needs at different times of day. It's a lot to keep track of. Poor thing. She's a really good dog. Sits all still when I give it to her. She comes by herself when I bring out the bottle. She knows the drill. Oscar 62. Six two. Oscar 64. Six four. India 21. Two one.

Are there two buses before the train? There's no train in the morning. In Karlshamn I change to the 600. - So when do the trains run? - They don't fit my schedule. But coming home... - I'm too tired today. - Alright. Pathology Department, this is Marcus. Hi there. Damn, that's hot... - Let's go for lunch now. - Yes, let's do that. - It's really good, this one. - Yeah? - This is a proper smoothie. Have some. - Hell no. - Don't you like it? - No. - Is it one of those fitness smoothies? - There's nutrition in smoothies. - Nutrition? - Yes, nutrition. - There's nutrition in a smoothie?! - Yes. It gives the body all the vitamins and minerals it needs. You just walk around like... As fit as a fiddle. A minute ago we were falling asleep... Oh no, the phone's ringing. Hello Mats-Ola, Lasse speaking. - Hi, how are you? - There's still hope. Hi Mats-Ola, Micke speaking.- Right, hello. Maybe I should apologize to Helen for screaming at her yesterday. I haven't really gotten around to it, so... Well, let's see. He was tall. - Do you need help? - No, I'm fine. Tall fellow. God damn, it's starting to rain again. Soon we'll have to go to the morgue too. Yep. It's almost time. - Look at that cat in the window. - That's cool. Damn beautiful animals. It's a pity I'm allergic. Yes, you should have an animal. A big heifer. Hell no... It's nice without animals. - They come with a big responsibility. - It's a really big responsibility. - Walk them, make them happy... - That's what I mean. Sure, you could have a bird but you still need to take care of it... Get a fish. Maybe I will. - A fish doesn't need as much company. - Nope. - This tasted good. - It sure did.

If you're many people you can make reservations ahead. Then everybody picks what they want from the buffet. We've been talking about a night out with all the gravediggers. We could eat here and then go bowling across the street. Yes, the could be loads of fun. I wouldn't mind that at all. - Let's talk to Micke about it. - Is this... spinach? I think it's meat. It's a Vietnamese spring roll. It's tasty. Really yummy. It sure hit the spot. It's a strange feeling. All of a sudden you no longer need to take her out for evening walks. Usually, I wasn't the one to take her out, but still... I miss it anyway. The company. It gets really quiet. We still have one dog, but... - It's not the same. - It's not my dog. - I get it. That's how it is. - Yes. Ronja belonged to both of us, even though she was primarily mine. - It feels strange. - It really does. - That's how it is when you have pets. - Exactly. It's the price you pay. - In a way, yes. It all happened too fast. - Yes. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face toward you, and give you peace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. We will now conclude this service by singing hymn number 235, "Love divine, so great and wondrous." We then conclude today's service by listening to a piece of music. When the music has finished we leave the chapel at our own pace.
