Is it a long way, still? We will get there soon. Do we really have to watch a nude show on a hot day like this? But I've heard Akiko’s show is good. Mitsuko said so, anyway. Isn’t it weird for a woman to watch a nude show? Nude Show The show will be starting soon! Hey! - Here. - This is the place. What's next? Next, it'll be Akiko’s show. Who is that? Chiyo Aoi. Apparently, she is the most popular star right now. She sure is pretty, isn’t she? Without touching or seeing, The hot blood of soft skin, Are you not lonely at all, Preaching the way of ethics? Without touching or seeing, The hot blood of soft skin, Are you not lonely at all, Preaching the way of ethics? Spring is short, Nothing has eternal life - With these words, I made his hands seek out my strong breasts, I made his hands seek out my strong breasts, My strong breasts, In my bath, Submerged like some graceful lily, At the bottom of a spring, How beautiful, This body of twenty summers, Well, we have done everything we had to do today. Let’s go back home tomorrow. I am starting to get tired of living in a ryokan. If you eat too much of this red beet, you see it in your poop. Goodness, such an unpleasant talk... Well... I saw the toilet water turn red the other day after taking a poop, and I thought I had a gastric ulcer. So, I talked with Dr. Fuse from Osaka University, and he said that the bloody stool from gastric ulcer should be black. Stop with that talk. I can't eat like this! From my excretion, a truly beautiful red color started to spread. But he explained to me that the toilet water would be the color of manganese peroxide. And he also said it must have been from what I ate, so I started thinking about it, and found out that the vegetable in this salad is the cause. Sister-in-law, was yesterday’s movie fun? - Did you go to a movie theater? - Yes. Mitsuko made me go. - What is the name of the movie? - “Witch in the Bathtub”. It was great! How was the ending like? Magazines aren't writing about it because they don’t want to spoil the ending. The main character, who is a painter, mistakes a guy in the bath for a woman and ends up killing him. Apparently, the incredible nude scene attracted a lot of people. I was attracted by its beauty, too, despite the fact that I am a woman. Who is the actress in that nude scene? Mina Yanagi, a newcomer actress. She is a voluptuous woman. I think you would fancy her. Brother, would you like to go there with me now? No way! Oharu will perform a dance at the theater today. This Oharu girl... Can she perform such a complex thing? Apparently, she is going to perform a new rendition of the Dojoji noh play at the theater. Why don’t you go there as well? Well, I have some business to take care of later. Since that’s the case, let’s meet later at Tsujitome in Ginza at 8 pm. Goodness, Tsujitome? I haven't had a pike eel soup there for such a long time. “Daydream”, screening since the 22th of June! What you've been waiting for has finally been released! It will become a masterpiece! Played by Mina Yanagi! “Witch in the Bathtub” That’s right. That’s how a criminal mind works. Who are you? Doctor! That’s ridiculous. How are you going to solve this? He is right. Do it properly. Who do you think you are? This is not a game. Bring the girl. Bring her here. I can’t do that, though! Hey, give me a tri-colored ice cream! I want another one! I might have committed the grave sin of murder or I might be having an illusion. I want you to prove that for me! I don't even know where to start from. I am but a poor painter. My wife, Ruriko... used to work as a geisha. Ah, Ruriko. I get jealous easily. When I think about you doing this kind of thing with other men, I really cannot stand it! Please... Don’t hang out with other men... Please, marry me! Let's run away together! - All right. - We will run away together, right? That's fine with me. We will really get married, right? That's fine with me. Hey, what happened? - But I... - I know your body is tired. The deadline is approaching. Be more patient, will you? All right. That's not how you do it! You are trying to kill me, aren’t you? I will never let my guard down. You damn whore! Ruriko... I am sick... This beautiful body... covered by oil, camellia, and the paint... is glistening! Ah, Ruriko! Oh, welcome! Thank you very much. Here. Hey, what is this? What seems to be the matter? Nothing, it seems I stepped on something slimy. It must be an ointment or something. What's up? There is a female body inside. It’s my wife’s dead body. A corpse! What seems to be the problem, huh? There is a female dead body in this bathtub. She must be my wife, no doubt. That's ridiculous! Stop joking around, will you? Such a thing is not... I definitely touched it! It’s as thick as raw seaweed. It’s as slithery as an eel. That can't be anything else but the feeling of Ruriko’s skin. He must have stepped on a puddle of oil or something. Okay now, come here and calm down. Come on! Come now! Oh, welcome home. How was your bath? My, you're acting strange. Ruriko, am I weird? Am I really a weird person? The side dish for tonight is your favorite, konjac. Ah, konjac... In order to show me that you won't leave me, step on me with the sole of your feet. You mean, like this? Hey, Ruriko. - Ruriko! - Yes? My, such a big canvas. I’ve been working on it for a while. I have finally finished it. You see, Ruriko, with this, I can become a great painter. The miracle of women. It's a good subject, isn't it? I will be recording your flesh. Now... Please, take off your clothes as usual. But... What is it? Get naked right away! Don't stand up! Move! Keep moving on the canvas! Roll! Roll around! Come over here! Keep rolling! Roll around more! Keep rolling! Roll around more! Move over there! More and more! Roll around more! That's it! That's it! That's it. This is the record of your body. It's the miracle of women! What a marvelous scene! That's right. Hey! Ruriko... I met your doppelganger at the public baths yesterday. I might be killed by you. I'm fine with that. I am... entirely satisfied with that. Until you finally kill me, please do not go away from me. I beg you. Huh? She's here again... Hey, are you all right? There is a female dead body inside this bathtub. Huh? Right now... with my own hands... I’ve just strangled her with this. A murderer! A murderer is over there! Don't say such ridiculous things! Calm down, will you? - Come! He is there! - You have to come! What the hell happened? It's this guy! You again? What a nuisance! Don’t make a scene once more. It's true this time. I actually saw her with my own eyes. Not only that. - I strangled her with this towel! - Huh? That's just absurd! Hey, Mr. Customer, hold this for me, will you? There's nothing here. That can't be! Drain the bathtub and you will definitely find her. It can't be helped, huh? I am serious... it's true! I guess we have no choice, then. This is today’s last session, anyway. I will drain the bath, but if there’s no corpse, what are you going to do? You are interrupting my business... - Please watch carefully, everyone. - Yes. Did someone ask you to do this to me? I am being serious. It’s not a lie. Look at it closely, everyone. My wife's body is right there at the bottom! Can you see it now? There's nothing inside! That was uncalled for. Oh my, it has already started. The Dojoji play. Oharu sure is a beauty. I ate a lot today. We ate the best Chinese food for lunch. Here, we ate pike eel sushi, puffer fish sashimi and duck. These taro buds are tasty. It's really delicious. Ah, pike eel soup. Recently, we've been eating a lot of this, right? It looks pure white, like a woman's fair skin. It has a slimy, muddy and thick texture, right? By the way, have you watched “Witch in the Bathtub”? Huh? Erm... My goodness! How was it? You liked the main character, Mina Yanagi, didn’t you? Well, she is kinda chubby. I think she is not my type. Really now? - Wow, it looks so yummy. - Yes, they are fresh sweetfish. This is one of the best dishes out there. Here, serve yourself. This is the tastiest way to eat sweetfish. The cook at Tsujitome told me that. They're still bringing more? I cannot eat anymore. My belly's full, as well. - Good evening. - Huh, yes... - Please excuse our tardiness. - Let me carry that. Much appreciated. Is something wrong with you? I guess I ate too much. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Yes, yes. Yes... I think... I ate too much... H-hey! Hey! Hey! THE END Hold me.
