He was an engineering student and I was a law student. We got married and returned to Nigeria. As the best in his engineering class it was, Easy to get a job with a prestigious oil company. We were so happy and comfortable. Then he spoilt me with the good things of life. He was also a passionate lover. Sounds like you had it all. I did. But I wasn't getting ahead as a lawyer. Found myself falling in love with fashion instead. You look fashionable when I saw you earlier. Thank you. So did you explore your fashion interest. I didn't just explore I excelled. And he sent me back to London to. To study fashion. He even pulled a multi million naira fashion line for me. Your Femi sounds like quite the man. I had the best equipment in hands.
