Glory to the weaver's mastery. Glory to the potter's mastery. Glory to the blacksmith's mastery. Glory. Glory. Glory to the Craftsmen's Town. Go away. Go away to the forest, or you all will be killed. Road to his Highness, duke De Moricorne, conqueror and subduedor Former free Craftsmen's Town, his squares and streets, guilds and stores, and also fields, forests, villages that lie adjacent to it and ravines. Down with foreign sholdiers. - Did you hear the screams? - I heard, you majesty. - Seize and bring to me. - But... Down with foreign sholdiers. Down with foreign sholdiers. Ouch, who is that? Karakol, you scared me. - How did you turn out to be here? - I was passing by and decided to call on. - What's the latest news, granny Tafaro. - What's the latest news? - Snatch and catch. - Down with foreign sholdiers! Revolter has climbed onto the roof. Follow me. Ohh sonny, sonny. Times have changed. I've taken the last rooster to the market. - And why didn't you sell him? - Nobody buys. People say: "Granny Tafaro, We can't buy when if it's too cheap We have conscience, and when it's too expensive, we can't buy as well, we don't have money". So I've brought him back. Down with foreign sholdiers. It should have been done fairly, why are you screaming, but it turned out to be another - Down with foreign sholdiers. - He sure has guts. - He is not here, Mr Baron - There he is. There he is, on the pipe. A parrot. Down with foreign sholdiers! Who has taught him to do that? I devised it myself. I will tell you the same under oath. Down with foreign sholdiers! Golden to one who catches him. Golden-big money. - Golden to one who catches him. - What? - Golden to one who catches him. - Golden to one who catches him. - Where is he? - Where is he? There he is. - Give it to me. - No. Golden. - Wouldn't it be too much? - If you don't want, then I'll let him go. Quiet. Let's do it. Catch him. A talking parrot was seized and brought back by my group. Turn on the light, jester. Let everybody see this miracle of nature. A customer was found even on your bird. How can I thank you? You must look not for a bird, but for a man. - Call the secret police chief. - I'm here, Mr Gilmon. You were overhearing again. His lordship will dismiss you, if you'll not find the person, who has taught this bird to talk. I was not overhearing, I was just listening to. I've heard that you failed to hear. - What did the parrot say? - Down with foreign sholdiers! - Not sholdiers but soldiers. - What's the difference? Down with us. Sholdiers. Instead of "s" - "sh". What does it mean? It means that the person, who has taught this parrot to... talks like this, lisps and whispers. And today we'll arest all people who lisp and whisper. And so we'll find the criminal. - Good morning, uncle Temale. - Good morning, Karakol. - Good morning, Karakol. - Good morning, uncle Nenosh. Tell me, man - an elephant sucks a pacifier. Does an elephant suck a pacifier? 40 houses and noone who lisps. What a town. - If we'll not find the one who lisps we'll be fired. - Who? - The Chief. - He won't do that. - Why? - If we'll not find the one who lisps, then the Duke will dismiss him sooner. So, tell me very fast. - An elephant sucks a pecifier. - An elephant sucks a pacifier. Ahh? An elephant sucks a pacifier. It would be better if they asked you something about a camel. What do you hide in your hump? Gold? Or wine? Damned humpback. Don't pay attention. They are not worth of it. Maybe their hump is even bigger than yours. - Come here, I will tell fortunes. - People usually conjecture for happiness. And my happiness is always with me. - As well as a hump on my back. - What is right, is right. But I've got nothing to thank you except my fortunetelling. Let me, an old woman, tell you your destiny. You'll be handsome, You'll be happy You'll get married to the most beautiful girl in a whole town. Don't laugh, or the fortunetelling will not be fulfilled. I would rather laugh than cry. And she will fall in love with me, humpback, the most beautiful girl in a whole town. But you are not humpbacked forever. Believe me. You won't have a hump. - And when will it happen? - So when you rescue the town from the hump. Listen. Listen. Listen. Everyone, in what the town is rich - in goods and manufactures, in jewels and delicacies, everything should be taken immediately to the table of his Highness Duke de Moricorne - The conqueror and subduedor... - How long will we endure this more? We maybe for a long time, but there are people whose patience is over. Who are they, granny Tafaro? - Did you hear screams last night? - Screams? Last night I was sleeping, what screams? Last night somebody was screaming... Let's wait for the night, uncle Nenosh. It's not time to say out loud in the daytime, what one cries out from the darkness. - Nobody listens to us. - Kliklak is comming. - Two men assembly is the limit. - Why? That's the order. Haven't you heard? - And who will assemble-quickly to prison. - Can we assemble only in prison? - He lies! How can he know? - I found out it from my father. I, burgomaster's son, know this better than anyone. Master, Gillom trusts only two people-me and my father. He trusts me. He trusts me. He trusts me and my father. Good morning, Karakol. Good morning, Veronik. Who are you laughing at? We're laughing at your fiance. I see. Who is he? Do I know him? Kliklak. He goes here and there, and tells everybody that he wants to marry you. You must be joking, Karakol? No, I'm not in the right mood for joking. This is the first time, when I hear that Karakol isn't in the right mood for joking. What's the matter with you today? It seems that you have lots of things to say but you don't know how. Don't know... I know. Listen. The bird is free to sing at night, But I can tell you guys, I'm scared to sing at night And I'm telling no lies. Let sun shine, Let sweat leak, Let crystal gleam, and let me... - Only Kliklak sings it the daytime. - And I, and I, and I. Uhh, vile animal. Fool. Don't disgrace. Don't disgrace. Fool. - I'll make you shut your mouth. - Fool. - Come here. Come here. - Fool. Come here. I'll beat you. You'll shut your mouth. Fool. Where are you going, vile animal? Tell me, Karakol, when and where did you see your brother? Yesterday, by the riverside. And how is he? Without house and fire. - I can't even think of it. - Living there is just the same as living here, in a town. In a forest, any shrub will cover you, and here... - The walls don't give the protection. - Am I right, Karakol? In a forest I have a fear for my brother, And here, in a town... Listen. Listen. Listen. All residents of this town must remove their hats before his throne and himself, Duke de Moricorne, conqueror and subduesor former free Craftsmen's Town. - His squares and streers. - At first they will remove their hats, then their heads will be removed. - Yup. - Hey. If a man has brains, instead of straw in his head, then he'll think up what to do. And. So what esle can you get from me? He who wears no hat, has nothing to remove before Duke. Here take my hat. And my. Put it on the top. Catch. What's going on here? Why are the hats hanging on the tree? This is an old town's custom, your majesty. To give your hats to birds for future baby birds. Your majesty, that jester on the tree is laughing at us. Seize him. Down with foreign sholdiers! Down with foreign sholdiers! - Down with foreign sholdiers! - He'll replace Jake. Poor Jake. He was so good funny, amusing, cheerful. - And my. - Do away with Duke. - Do you like it? - Very well. - But I have to retrain my parrot again. - Why? He was living with the drunkard and he speaks in a woman's voice, and says every time the same sentence. - And what does he say? - Damn you. - Who are you looking for? - Miller. - And what do you want from him? - I've got grain for him. - For what? - He'll work up it-there'll be flour. - Here, I've got a parrot. - And what can he say? We'll see. - Long live the Duke! - What did he say? - What? What? - I didn't know. He has deceived me. - Who? - Kliklak. He gave this parrot as a gift to me. How did he get to know about us? Did you tell him? Yes, but took an oath that, he will tell nobody. - How could you do that? - I took an oath too, that I'll tell nobody, I thought, it was right. - Traitor. - Chatter box. - Girl. - You've believed KLiklak. Now you see, you've babbled enough. Hold it right now. Mr Burgomaster with his son. What do you want to get from his Highness for you as a reward? - I have only one wish. - What? To marry. My respect to his Highness is tremendous, but my love to Veronik is enormous. What do you mean? Without his Highness order she'll not marry me. Certainly, without an order, she won't. - Dad. - Long live the Duke! Great. Repeat, little fool, once again. Long live the Duke! Why did you bring me in here, now, at dinner time? I insist on it, Mr Baron. - On what? - I want you to test the next. Okay. Open up... this one. Listen. Long live the Duke! Do the others say the same? - The same. - So what can you say now? - I don't believe these people. - But you should believe you ears. I don't believe people and my ears. I believe only in accusations, in accusations. - Test the next. - Open up this one. - Long live the Duke! - Long live the Duke! Long live the Duke! Long live the Duke! Do you undestand? This is what an example mean. I'm sure that in one year, with the help of your soldiers All inhabitants will be saying the same. Take it. I'm taking this miracle of nature with me. - Why? - Because I want to show it to his Highness. You're doing you job very well young man. Ohh, yes, what's your name? - Ohh, Mr Baron. - No, don't be excessively modest. I have to report to Duke, that there is a man, who holds up the new order who has taught the parrot to say - Long live the Duke! - His name is Kliklak. - Kli... what? Kliklak. - Kliklak? - Yes, Mr Baron. What a strange name, but I'll try to remember it. Kliklak. Kliklak. Kliklak. Kliklak. Maybe you know, who can rouse the indignation of blacksmiths, shoemakers? Of course I know, your Highness, it's a humpback Karakol. - Hold your tongue. - How is that, to hold? And the sweeper, that was sitting on a tree. Yes. He is the first agitator. And he has thought up that think with the parrot. He made up that thing with the hats. Do you know what hump does he have? Like this. Your Highness, I'm sorry, I didn't know that you look like him. What do you mean? You mean the Duke de Moricorne looks like that sweeper? Of course no, your Highness, your legs are thinner, and hump is bigger, you're nicer, and I just came into the wrong view. Why do you so dislike that sweeper? Because he laughs at me and Veronik. - Do you want to marry her? - Yes, in any moment your Highness. Begin to prepare for the marriage, burgomaster. So when can I marry her? When you get rig of that sweeper. And how can get rid of him? Kill him. Your Highness, if I'll try to kill him, then he'll kill me sooner. Don't you know how shrewd he is? Why don't you decoy him into trap or push off into a pit. Easy to say, trap. Where I can find that trap? Dig. I'm scared. Well... Then Veronik will marry Karakol. They will be a great married couple. - What is this? - This is a talking parrot, your Highness. Why did you bring him? This amazing bird can say: Long live the Duke. Yes. - Who has taught? - I. Yes, yes, your Highness, his name was said. Your Highness, how can you reward me? I will be present at your marriage Open up. And, why is he silent? One moment. Popochka, how did I teach you? And. One moment. Repeat after me. Repeat. Long live the Duke! - Long live the Duke! - Damn you. And. Will you kill the sweeper? You offend me, your Highness. My sword will cope with this problem better than he. You're devoted and brave, Gillom, but old-fashioned. A man worshipped by the mob Shall be killed not by a stranger, but by one of... the mob. I can't hold on any more, I'm tired. - Tomorrow I'll join your people in the forest. - There is already lots of people there. - Lots of people but for nothing. - What can they do without arms? - They're hoping to get them from you. - They are waiting for nothing. - I don't understand. - You will now. Do you see? When you finish to forge, you'll give us everything. - Now you undestand? - When do you finish the fence? - I'm not going to do. - What fence? Iron, around the castle. I won't do that, and won't forge shackles. And jail bars, I won't do anything. Enough. Beware, blacksnith, I'll report about this immediately to his Highness. I don't know exactly about the shackles and jail bars, but fence you will make. Uhh. And who will make me do it, Duke de Moricorne? - Lift higher. - So who? I. Gentlemen. Hand over to Duke that the building of the fence will be started today. People say that Karakol has composed this song for you, Veronik. And also for you, and for all, who are holding a needle in their hands. What a boy, if he hadn't had a hump, he would be the best fiance for any our girl. - I don't notice that he has a hump. - Really. So what are you waiting for? Don't you see that he's in love with you. Stich after stich, Saw on my needle. Though shall not sleep. Blue sky, bright sun. And flowers red On silk you've embroidered. - Where is he being carried? - I hope far from us. They're coming here. For what? Maybe thay want to find out, where our brother is hiding? - Maybe he's already seized? - No. They're coming. - It seems that he is not a deputy. - He is ugly. Good morning, madams. Which of them is your daughter, master Ferren. However, I can tell this myself. And these beautiful women? They are my daughter's friends. No, madam, I ask, please, stay. - I don't want to interfere in your conversation. - I want to say something and it touches upon you. Master Ferren, don't you think, the time has come to marry off your beautiful daughter? Even if knew Mr Musherone and his son Kliklak less than I know, even then I wouldn't talk to him. I ask. I have come here with his Highness and I'll leave only with his permission. You may believe that you got it. Gillom. Walk Mr Burgomaster to the gates. Master Ferren, can you accord an honor to a dear friend. - If you're a man... - Am I not? I don't know, if you have a heart, then let me stay with my father. Show me your face. I want to see how you cry. Don't laught at me. You're still in my house. - And you're in my town. - I know that. From the time when you became a ruler it's impossible even to breathe here. I can give back to the town his liberty and freedom. - All depends on you, Veronik. - On me? What can I do? - Put this on. - What this? Engagement ring that belonged to my mother. Put it on. Now it's yours. - What for? - You'll become Duchness de Moricorne. - What? You must be joking. - No. You will be my wife. Go to hell, vile spider. Ahh, you don't like me. But I like you, and that's enough for me, for me, the ruler of this town, to make you my own maid, and I want to marry you!!!!!! Nice goldsew. You ask for my hand? Here you are. I'll answer for this little prank, but later. What's the matter with you, Veronik? Don't worry. Musherone will never enter your house. That's true Mr Ferren. And no one else. Your house and your beautiful daughter will be guarded. (sings) It seems that he is walking here. So he is digging this pit not for an animal but for a man. - Nowadays a man is worse than an animal. - You may think so. It's immaterial to us, master. Dig here. - Hi Karakol. - Hi Ferrek. - Hi Karakol. - Hi Millik. Hi Temale. - Did you bring the letter, Karakol? - Yes, I brought for all of you. - And for me? - Give it to me. Dear son, when you come back home? I mean not home, because it was burned by strangers... Dear brother, how are you there in the forest among wild animals? Without home and fire... Dear sonny, we are waiting for the time, when you come back to the town, and blockheaded will run away in fear... Forget it, everything's going to be allright. No, you don't have to accompany me. There where new roads begin, strangers can be met. Goodbye Karakol. Hand over my greetings to your father. - Goodbye Ferrek. - Say that we'll meet each other soon. Soon. I've already made arrangements with blacksmiths about fence. Today I'll have a talk with, bell ringers and when everything's ready - they can ring. And you wait. Listen. Beware, today the Duke is going hunting. Pay attention. Your Highness. Here. I ask. Come back, Mr Gillom. I'll go alone. Take a look on new areas for hunting. - Here. Here. - Are you sure that we'll have big game? - I'm sure, your Highness. - So. So. So. So. So. - Show me. - Okay. 5 steps ahead from here. 1, 2, 3, 4... 5. 3 steps to the right and you're in the pit. Where? - I mean that you're on the right place. - You go first. Amm. 1, 2, 3. No. One can cram a hump this way. I don't need that, because I'm going to marry Veronik. (sings) Karakol. If he'll fing out that we're here, he'll kill us. There is someone here. Shut up, Musherone. It's me. His Highness servant, the keeper of the seal, - Get me out of here, I'll pay. - And me. I don't need anything from you, sir. Keep the seal in this pit, the better place for it cannot even be imagined. Wait. Get me out of here, do you hear me? I'll give you this seal for 3 days. You'll rule this town for 3 days. During this time you'll have time to do many things. You can send people to the execution block, you also can save people from it. - Throw me the seal. - Do it, your Highness. One moment. Right. Ring set with a seal. If we can arrange it without cheating ...Okay. - Faster, sweeper. - Suffer. Faster. Go. - Go. Pull. - Away. Pull. Karakol. Karakol, and me? Wait. - You'll lose the ring. - No, I won't. I was thinking all the time, about his Highness's seal. Hold that man. - He has stolen the ring set with a seal. - Seize him. You're a liar, your Highness. Seize him. Your lordship. You'll never find it. Your Highness. Will you order to execute him immediately, your Highness? No, Gillom. We'll execute him as a thief, that has stolen my ring, on the square before the very eyes of people. Listen. Listen. Listen. The next morning here on the square an execution will take place. The criminal and thief will be executed, the criminal, that has ingringed upon the property and the life of his Highness Duke de Moricorne. The conqueror and subduedor former free Craftsmen's Town. - Who is being carried, uncle Temale? - I don't know. Now all people are criminals and thiefs. Get up. I want to talk to you. People usually sit in the jail, your lordship, but not stand. So sit down and speak. Why animals and birds are friends with you, sweeper? You can ask them about it, your Highness. Why do people love you, sweeper? Because I love them. Why does Veronik... love you? She loves me? It's easier to say for me, why does she hate you. She hates me? Because I'm a humpback. Don't you see that I'm a humpback too, your Highness. There's a secret. Tell me, what's it all about. I'll free you, will you tell? Why are you silent, humpback? I'll give you gold, everything you want. Look, Veronik will never be yours, fool. You'll be executed in an hour, and I'll marry Veronik. You and Veronik? Yes, sweeper! You'll not leave! Help! Sweeper! - You'll pay for this with you life! - Be qiuet, your Highness. We should keep quiet in the darkness. Or an enemy, when he hears your voice, can sneak up to you behind and squeeze your mouth with your own cuff. Goodbye! Let's go and see his Highness's bride. - Let's go. - Take off the clothes. Your Highness, you've lost your right cuff. You'd better tell about this my valet. To the Ferren's house! Road to his Highness, Duke de Moricorne! Road to his Highness, Duke de Moricorne! Road to his Highness, Duke de Moricorne! Nonsense - Now they have marriage, now they have funerals. Veronik would rather die, than marry you, damned spider. What did you say, blacksmith? I said that the fence around the castle, for his Highness is already done. the fence around the castle, for his Highness is already done! - My arm hurts. - Stand it, we'll execute the sweeper and then we'll go on vocation. Look, humpback! Humpback! Do you hear? He hears. Look how he spins. Now, you will die! Ohh, your Highness! Your Highness, she shatters dishes and pots with flowers. Don't pay attention! She beats them over my head. - Can I use my force. - Don't even think about it! Faster! Away! Torch! Where is he? Where is he? I can't understand. Where is he? Come here, all of you! Quickly! Bouquet! I'll go alone! His Highness Duke de Moricorne! - One more step and I'll kill you! - Hold it right now, Veronik! Veronik! Yield to the bride of your lord and master! Lower! Lower! Let's go. I was late and couldn't alert, the ringers. Seize that man! I'm a lawful ruler of this town! Get off the way! Seize the sweeper! Seize him! - Run, Veronik! - Seize him! Seize! Seize him! - Where did he go? - Faster. Come on. Seize him! Hold him! Seize him! I need him alive! - Where's Veronik? - I'll bring her back your Highness. - Where's the sweeper? - I'll kill him, your Highness. Or I'll kill you. In half an hour all will be back with victory and Veronik, your Highness! Death to the sweeper! Cruel death to the sweeper! Entering password for the castle guard: " Victory and Veronik ". - Did you hear the password? - " Victory and Veronik " Shoemaker, shoemaker, blacksmith, come out. The forest is far, and misfortune is near. They didn't ring the bells, there's no need to wait for help. Death to the craft! Death to the shoemakers and blacksmiths! (The solemn hymn sounds) The bell! The bell! Why aren't they ringing? Damn it! Ours are waiting for the ringing in the forest! Victory! Where are they? Why don't they ring the bells? Messenger to Duke de Moricorne! - Password! - "Victory and Veronik"! Let in! Victory, your Highness! flawless Victory! - Where's Veronik? - She is coming. - And the sweeper? - Killed. Glory! Glory! I've brought great news. Ask want you want. I wish that in honor of your victory all bells ring. Everybody to the square! Ring the bells! Do you hear? Drink for my marriage, messenger. - For your death. - The sweeper is inside! (The bells are ringing) - Your Highness! - What, the sweeper? Defend yourself, your Highness. The sweeper is here! Here! Your Highness. Come here. That will do. - Pray, the sweeper! - Ahh, aren't you tired? Where are you going, your Highness? Come back, we'll have a talk. So what do you want to say at last, your Highness? Die, bitch! And so! (Karakol's laugh) Damned sweeper has died! Died! Died! Damned sweeper has died! What's going on granny? You told me that he'll spread his wings. Handsome and happy he will be. Hasn't he spread his wings darling? Got rid of humpback. Cry. Cry people. There's nothing in a whole world hotter than woman's tears. They can raise even dead. The sweeper has died! Died! Get up! Get up, sonny! Don't you see our tears? Damned sweeper has died! Don't you hear the laugh and joy of your enemies?! Get up. Get up. (Sweeper's song) Where's your hump, Karakol? Till this time it was with me, and now... Here sonny my words have come true. It seems that you had wings instead of hump on you back. Just as birds have. You've killed the villain, and spread your wings. Hold on iron-headed! He breathes! I was just pretending. Are you okay? Yes. - Do you know how does Veronik look like? - How? This like! And Karakol? This like! And we have a present for them. - What present? - Here, take a look. There was a man who loved a girl they married and lived happily to the end of the world No one could tell then and where But it happened a long time ago. The manuscript's letters were faded and blurred But know. Time will never be able to blur, the courage so strong and unbending, And this tale of love, Mixed with grief and struggle, will always be told with a happy end.
