Come on. Got a nice fire out here. All right. I built this nice fire... just for you. Come on. Kneel. Come over here and kneel. Come over here. Swear to God, because that's what I'm gonna do to you. After I kill you, I'm gonna burn you like that. I'm gonna burn your head in a fucking fire, and I'm gonna watch it. I'm gonna watch your pretty face melt. I'm gonna watch your eyeballs fall out of your fucking head. No! I want you to look up at the stars. Look at the stars. I want you to see the stars while you're dying. See how beautiful they are? Aren't they beautiful? God. Look at 'em. Look at 'em. All right. All right. We'll do this another way. We'll do this a different way. Where are you now, God? You gonna strike me down? Where are you now? Where's your-your thunderbolt to strike me down? Where's the crevice in the earth that's supposed to open up and swallow me? Where is it? Nothing? Nothing? Bundy, I wanna talk to you. So nice of you to visit. It's always good to see a familiar face. Cut the bullshit. Did my appeal come through? Doesn't look too good this time. Three's a charm, I guess. Yeah. Looks like your luck's runnin' out this time. Some say "luck." Others say "fate." Yeah, fate. That's right, you're a Christian now. I'm amazed how many of you assholes don't find religion till you get to Death Row. Yeah. Must be fate, right? Right. Yes. What do you want? Of course. Haven't I already confessed enough? You can provide details right till the end, Bundy. - Right until the moment of your... - My execution. "Execution" is the word. Families of your victims are owed a lot more information, Bundy. Now, if you're goin' down that hallway for the last time, what would it hurt to give a little bit more? Now, haven't I always been straight with you? I suppose. Take the recorder. You owe me. Yeah. It's quite a sight down here, Barbara, as everyone's come down here in anticipation of the execution of Ted Bundy, convicted killer... who began his killing spree in Washington, was twice convicted in Colorado and twice escaped from Colorado prisons and continued his killing spree down and in through Florida. These people... I've never seen such a frenzied, morbid celebration of hatred for one individual. In fact, I want to interview one man just to find out what it is exactly that he's feeling right now. Sir, what is it that you feel about this man right now? I'm feelin' angry all over because he's taken advantage of innocent people. He should be doing something else with his time. Do you feel like he's getting what he deserves? I do. You guys feel like it? Well, it seems like that's the general consensus of everyone here. To fully comprehend all of this, you gotta go back a few years to understand Ted Bundy, what he did, and who he was. Isn't this just peachy keen? I'm sure Eleanor will tell us sooner or later why we're here. Sam, please be nice. Fine. Well, hello. Guess who decided to show up. You know, I told you guys again and again that once you moved out, I wasn't gonna help you anymore. Hey, Sam, we're not looking for your handouts. The hell you're not. Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I just came into town with a load of hay on my back? Look, enough... - Stop it! The boy is gonna hear you! I don't give a rat's ass! I've had enough of this charade. Teddy? Daddy, Daddy, you promised me! You promised you would never say anything. It'll destroy him. It's not right. Enough is enough. Teddy? No! No, no! Please, no! Please, Dad, no! Stop! This ain't gonna happen. Get out of my house. And it's not gonna happen in front of my wife! You're not getting the top hand! You are not opening that door! No, you're not! Don't touch that door! I can open that door. Bastard. Enough! Look. I mean, I am his father, right? Since when can a father not talk to his son? Look what you've done. This isn't over, Bundy. Nobody does this to Sam Cowell and gets away with it! It's okay, Teddy. I'm here. It's all right, Teddy. Everything's gonna be all right. Don't you worry, okay? Stephanie. Hey, what are you doing later today? I'm not really sure. Well, we're gonna have a study session in the library, if you wanna stop by. Um... You know, can I catch up with you later? - Sure. See ya. - Thank you. How long you been standing there? Where? Over there? Yes, silly. Over there. I wasn't just standing. I was, um... watching also. Watching? Admiring your beauty from afar. Um... "See how she rests her hand upon her cheek. That I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek." I might've got it wrong. Stupid Shakespeare. That might be... the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me. No, I was watching you, too. No, you weren't. Yes, I most certainly was. So... have you told anyone about us yet? It's supposed to be a big secret. Sometimes secrets are meant to be broken. No, that's promises. What about you? Just my best friend. Told her I was seeing a younger man. Guess this, "younger man" has a lot to learn? Walk you to your next class? Yeah. I'd like that. You read Shakespeare? Sure. Yeah? As You Like It.

What about you? I had a... stepdad. Sort of a stepdad. I was, raised by my sister, who... Well, I mean, I had a real dad. Sam Cowell, who... little bit of a drinker. But my sister raised me. Yeah. She moved us away from there to Tacoma when I was really little. She's, like, 15 years older than me. And then that's when she married Johnnie. Was he good to you? Johnnie? I mean, he wasn't around very much. My sister was, though. She loved me very much. Like a mother. She doted on me. Did he do all right? I mean, did you have a nice house, car, all that? No. No, Johnnie was a cook for hotels, stuff like that, and didn't make very much. And then my sister started getting pregnant. I mean, it was very difficult to make ends meet. Sorry to hear that.

Are you gonna give me the silent treatment? Hey, Stephanie, I don't know what's going on here. Seriously. I've absolutely no idea. Did I do something? Come on! You're a flake, Ted. You're immature. You need to grow up. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so sick of your behavior. Stephanie, what are you talking about? Come on! My behavior? My parents, Ted! You stood us up! We were waiting for you at the restaurant for more than an hour! Of all the people, you stood up my parents! You know what school is like for me right now. I've been so busy, I haven't been able to keep track. You could've reminded me. I could've reminded you? Yes. I specifically reminded you yesterday. I specifically reminded you last night! How many times do you need me to remind you? - It's obviously not important to you! - Yes, it is important to me. - No, it's not. - It's very important. You don't care about me or my feelings. Yes, I do. You know what? There's something about you that bothers me even more. What? What? You're jealous. You know, since I'm being honest... you ooze jealousy, Ted Bundy. I'm sorry that you had a crappy childhood. I'm sorry that your father didn't love you. I'm sorry that you had to be raised by your sister.

Wouldn't it be under your mother's maiden name? No, I have the feeling it'll be under my father's. That's odd, but they are public records, so... feel free to have a look. I'm gonna leave you alone.

Well, folks, it's time that we clearly impart our wisdom on America. And I think it's time that we spread out to neighboring states, set the record straight. It's time to let every American know that here in Washington state it's not going to be politics as usual. Mr. Davis, I say we start letting the Dems have it on the Roe versus Wade issue. Ross, don't you think it's time for a debate? I say we go local first, and then we attack on a neighborhood level. - Let's let the people of Washington choose. - It's all about the numbers. Okay, look, we have a lot of work to do before the numbers mean anything. In fact, I think it's imperative that we let the Democrats in Washington state know that we not only plan on taking this state, but we are going to make our stamp on Oregon, Idaho... - California. - Nevada. - Utah. - Texas. I've always liked Florida myself. We are going to change this great country state by state by state. And we're gonna get our asses out of Vietnam. We're gonna make sure the Russians don't have any nukes. Yes, sir, but you're just running for governor. Marti, he may just be running for governor now, but he's also laying the foundation for his future presidency, right? We all know it's a natural progression to go from running a state to running the Union. If we all rally behind Mr. Davis here, give him 100 percent of our support, we may just find ourselves walking the halls of the West Wing with Mr. Davis. It's President Davis, Ted. President Davis. All right, now we are going to give some assignments, and I'm gonna start with you, Ted. I want you to go to Sacramento. And I want you to tear into their house of representatives and their senators and let them know that Ross Davis is not going to stand idly by. No, sir, the Davis campaign is about bringing Washington state to the forefront of the American psyche. We're gonna do it with hard work, dedication, determination. What do you say? - Right on.

He escaped twice, but Florida authorities have... There he is. Let's see if we can get a comment. Mr. Bundy. - Mr. Bundy, what is your case? - Mr. Bundy, Mr. Bundy. Mark first. Mark first. Mark, how can I help you? Who's going to be your attorney? Well, I'm going to be going with the only man that I trust, and that's me. - You're going to be acting as your own lawyer? - Of course. Why wouldn't I? I'm law school-educated, and I know my case better than anyone else. - Mr. Bundy... - Please, "Ted." Call me Ted. Guys, come on. Quit being so formal here. Have you ever physically harmed another person? I have answered this question many times over. - And? - Again, no. Not in the context of things you're speaking of. - What does that mean? - Are you guilty? I know that you're all going to be paying very close attention to the case. In America, we all have the right to self-defense. Okay? And soon I will be defending myself, and the truth will come out. Now, gentlemen, ladies, I have to leave you now, but it won't be the last time that you hear from me. Mr. Bundy? Ted, I... Well, there you have it. Theodore Robert Bundy will be representing himself in the first of two major cases against him. He is charged with the brutal murder and rape of Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman. All right, Mr. Bundy. Now that our stomachs are full and we're back in the cool air conditioning, we're gonna proceed with your counter of Detective Jennings. Detective Jennings, you may find your place back on the witness stand. And may I remind you, you are still under oath. That's very mature, Detective Jennings. Very mature. Yes, Your Honor. May I continue, Your Honor? Certainly. Good afternoon, Detective Jennings. Hello, Mr. Bundy. How was your lunch? Fine. - Objection, Your Honor. - Sustained. Mr. Bundy, please. Stay on track. Just trying to make things comfortable for him up there on the stand. And I'm just trying to say, "Stay on track." Of course, Your Honor. Detective Jennings, I would like to start today... by taking the court back in time just a bit. Describe for me, in detail... what you saw when you walked into the room... of Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman. Detail. Well, I was one of the first detectives there that morning. It was a gruesome scene. The sorority girls who lived in the house were screaming, crying, yelling. They didn't know what to do with themselves. I tried my best to console the poor girl who came up to me, but I had to get upstairs to see what had happened for myself. And why were you in such a hurry? It was my understanding that there was girls dying in the house. You understood that there were girls "dying" in the house, but right here, on the, police report... that you were informed hours earlier that the two victims that survived the attack were already transported to the hospital, and the only two people left at the house were already dead. Well, yes, but it... I don't understand your point. My point is, Detective Jennings, is that you were not in a hurry. You were trying to be a hero, showboating in front of a bunch of college-age sorority girls... - Objection. He's badgering the witness. - Sustained. Mr. Bundy. Keep your personal opinions to yourself, please. We're only interested in the facts here. Of course, Your Honor. The facts. The facts. Yes. So, Mr. Jennings, if you will then, please... tell me in detail... what you saw when you went... into the upstairs room of Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman. In detail! Well, I walked down the hall to an officer standing at a door, and when I got to the door, I could see that the officer had tears welling up in his eyes. So I knew it must be a gruesome sight beyond the door. The officer stepped aside. Neither of us said a word. Please continue, Detective Jennings. Well, I opened the door gently with my elbow, making sure not to touch anything with my bare skin. - And... - And? And when I stepped inside the room, I was shocked... by the most gruesome, heinous sight I'd ever seen. Um... I'm sorry, Your Honor. I-I just don't... I don't wanna disrespect the court or you, but I don't understand why it's necessary for me to go into the gory details. Your Honor, it is necessary because I am defending myself against false accusations of murder in the first degree, - and if I believe that it is necessary for Mr. Jennings - Your Honor, objection. To testify about what he saw in that murdered woman's room, in detail, - Mr. Bundy! - Then he must continue! This is my courtroom... and only I will decide what is necessary. Now, we're all givin' you the benefit of the doubt here, but you will stop with the outbursts, or I will hold you in contempt of court. Now, Mr. Bundy, I will let Detective Jennings continue, but I am warning you, though. Watch the antics. Of course, Your Honor. May I apologize to the court for my outburst. I will... try to curb my behavior. Now, Detective Jennings, please continue, in detail, what did you see when you entered the bedroom of Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman? When I stepped inside the room, I saw Miss Levy's bed first. Her bed was closest to the window. Her arms and legs were twisted in strange positions. Her white sheets were almost entirely red from the blood that had seeped from her head and from between her legs. Where her weight was heaviest on the mattress, the blood had pooled and dripped into a puddle on the ground. And then I looked left to Margaret Bowman's bed. I didn't, of course, I didn't know the girls' names until later. Miss Bowman's body was lying in a prone position, with her head upside down resting backwards over the bed. I leaned into Miss Bowman's face, and I saw what appeared to be multiple major contusions to her skull, her eye sockets and her jaw. She was a mess. Objection, Your Honor, I... I-I-I-I-I-I move that the word "mess" be stricken from the record. It's subjective. It does not accurately describe a crime scene. Mr. Bundy, you asked the detective for his description of the scene. Court believes that the word "mess" is part of the detective's description that you asked for. Please continue, Detective. She too had blood all over her sheets and her pillows. Blood had puddled underneath her head on the floor, and she seemed to have a large amount of blood between her legs. It is ordered that you, Theodore Robert Bundy, be put to death by a current of electricity and that that current pass through your body till you are dead. Take care of yourself, young man, please. And I say that to you sincerely. Take care of yourself. It is an utter tragedy to see such a total waste of humanity as I've experienced in this courtroom. You are a bright young man. You'd have made a good lawyer, and I'd love to have you practice in front of me, but you went another way, partner. So take care of yourself. You ever seen an execution, Withers? No, sir. I heard it's not a pretty sight. Ha! No, it is not. But they all get what they deserve, right, sir? They didn't get here by being Boy Scouts. No appetite? Can't say I blame you. Well, after years of eating my meals off the floor, Warden, I've developed an acute distaste for prison food, thank you. I didn't think that I was going to be able to hear them from here. And they all want me to fry. Every last one of them. As if this is all my fault. Well, whose fault is it, Ted? Society. Society made you murder all those poor women. Society and pornography. Yes. That's a load of shit! You know it and I know it. Well, what do you think it is? I saw your interview with Dobson. You really think that in your final hour you can lay down your entire legacy? I was trying to help society... by explaining to them how I became so... demented. You became so demented... because of you. You made every choice along the way. You could've stopped anytime, but you didn't. I'm not fallin' for it. You're not mental. You're not deranged. You're the most normal, intelligent man I've ever had on death row. You know what you are? What am I, Warden? You're a whiny, immature little boy that never had the balls to become a man. You stop talking into this thing, and I'll make sure you and old Sparky get to know each other real well. Got it? Theodore... you asked for forgiveness? Yes, Mom, I've asked for forgiveness. I... I have repented. I took my, my First Communion last night. Well, then God will accept you. You'll be just fine. And you be a good boy. I will see you soon. You don't have to rush. I'm not going anywhere. I love you, Teddy. I always have. I know. I know. I'll be fine. Everything will be fine. Bundy! Come on. Get up. It's time. What time is it? It's 5:00 a.m. Did my appeal come through? Nope. In fact, the governor just gave his go-ahead. Sorry, Bundy. It looks like this time's the real deal. Come on. We got a lot to do. We gotta shave your head, we gotta prepare your final meal... I'm not hungry. Well... we'll make something. You can eat it if you want to. Come on. You know the deal. No, turn around. Do it in front today. God! God... God.
