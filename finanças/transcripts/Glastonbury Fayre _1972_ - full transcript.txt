[audience cheering] - Alright, quiet. Ladies and gentlemen, special announcement. It only happens one time a year. Tonight is Arthur's birthday, so would you all join me in singing Happy Birthday to him? ♪ Happy Birthday dear Arthur ♪ Happy Birthday to you [spooky music] [laughing] [moves into drumming] - I had a vision on the south coast of Glastonbury tour, such a strong one that I drove without navigating. It was so unnecessary, I'm sure of it now, around halfway to the sign - seven miles to Glastonbury. [humming] [drumming] Two days later, driving again, a picture of Andrew with a telephone book behind him. I pulled over, stopped, and dialed him. He was waiting, "Fluvial come 'round, we have the farm." [drumming] I can't tell you my version of this. - [Voiceover] You're an architect right? - I'm an instructivist. [pounding] - Yeah, yeah I know. - Lovely. - Is it lighter yet? - Yeah just about. - You up there, you see those yellow things over there? Could we have one? - Sorry. - Oh well, we'll have to go ourselves again.

The middle of Shepton Mallet we'll pick you up and bring you straight into the site. Okay? It tends to be a bit muddy. Have you got any boots with you? You too, bye.

Okay, sleep well, bye. - [Voiceover] What'd he say? - What? - [Voiceover] What'd he say? - That wasn't him, it was Melanie. - [Voiceover] Was it the manager? - The manager, he hasn't called.

And of course you can feel it at Stonehenge too. If you go just behind what they call the rock of sacrifice, you get this same kind of powerful magnetic field there. I expect that these people who built these places knew how to douse for them. It doesn't require a special instrument, as you can see one's own body is the instrument. ["Dirty Linen" by Fairport Convention] [people chatting] - Can you press up here? [drumming] - If you take it as a special happening, I think you will then think on the terms of what is going to happen at this particular event. But I don't think you ought to approach it that way. As a Christian, all of time is God's time, and therefore, you expect a happening all the time. ["Glastonbury Fayre Jam" by Michael Magic] [screaming] - Thank God mother, and I could be insane in this world! [screaming] [drumming] [howling] - I was surprised you know. thinking about the thing later, I was amazed how there was nothing of suggesting indecency and pornography and that sort of thing. And yet there they were, all in the nude. And behaving perfectly natural. And I as part of the crowd, too, didn't feel awkward at all. I was amazed at myself really.

And my chicken from France, his name is Fricassee. No, I'm just kidding, he's a lousy, dirty Englishman five miles from here. He's got the fleas, he gropes around on the ground picking his nose. He's so dirty he's even got a case of the crabs and he is stoned. And he not only is stoned, but he's been talkin' to me. And he said that the sun was having a gigantic orgasm today. Today it had a giant orgasm, making love to Mother Nature right here underneath our feet. And from Mother Nature we all came. We sprang from the womb, we sprang from the grass and the flowers, and in this beautiful love process came chickens, lambs, little pigs, and little children. And a bunch of stoned freaks like ourselves. - I was actually wandering through the surrounding cornfields before, and there's still one or two people doing it. Probably they're all out of their heads anyhow, tripped out completely, but it'd be rather groove if you could avoid the cornfields and not fuck up the corn because we want to keep the people on our side and we want to keep the corn in good pick as well.

You will perish someday, you should know such a thing. That is imperishable never will perish and that is the holy word, holy knowledge of God, and that is within you. But if the true God is equal for everyone, life is the [mumbles] indeed. God in English who died for you. If God is the same thing, God is not you be all the same. If the formula H2O is a formula for water for everywhere, that means the flavor that is the water will be the same everywhere. If the God is equal, if the God is one, and God is same, that is not also equal. And it cannot be akin by going to different sects and religions. That is within you and if you want to go you can only within your bodies look. Different sects and religions not the knowledge. But to go anywhere, you need some money, some pounds. To go to the Jahad you need some pounds for the tickets, or for anywhere you need some pounds. My pounds are the love and the devotion pounds that can only be attained by a bank. You have a bank, in your sense of it, the money of love and devotion. Because I've got that word, I've got that knowledge, I've got that thing, and I can say to you all that I can help mankind and every onr of you by giving that knowledge.

Brothers and sisters... - Good. [instrumental music] In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. The Lord be with you. - And also with you. - My dear people, it is a great privilege to come here. I believe where the Church is, where people are, the Church should be. And so I've come here in this wonderful moment to be able to do the Mass and ask for Almighty God's blessing on you all. - And you see the archetypes of all things before thee become frozen into matter. The universal face of all people behind their physical face. You understand the meaning of all events behind the actual happenings. Experience, envision yourself as being a consciousness. A luminous consciousness. - You are all of you, sons of God through faith in Jesus Christ. All baptized in Christ and there are no more distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, but all of you are one in Christ Jesus. [singing in foreign language] [clapping] - The message of Christ in this reading from the gospel is very very simple isn't it? If we want to live we must die. [clapping and chanting] - He was crucified, died, and ascended. He ascended to Heaven where he is seated at the right hand of the Father. I believe that the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life who proceed to the Father and the Son. Together with the Father and the Son, is adored and doted by. Let us pray for Almighty God's blessing on us all. We should show a community feeling so that the whole world may be one community. Lord hear us.
