The film is based on a true story of gang warfare in okinawa. However the characters and the organisations are fictitious, and are not related to existing institutions. ToEI okinawa - Otherwise known as Koza The year after okinawa's reversion to Japan (1972). Welcome! Welcome! This is the chain restaurant "Drinkers' Heaven". We're proud to have 450 stores all over Japan... And we hope to satisfy the demands of the people of okinawa, too, with our service! Quality service! We bring you the cheapest and the best food. With the grand opening of this store, we are holding a special promotion! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! This way, please. What are you doing? Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! -- out of my way! -- Stop this! Chief! Chief! Are you alright? Ichikawa! Why didn't you stop him? You think he'd stop? Shut up! Brother... It's an important time for the Kunigami group. Just imagine what would happen if we fuck this up. This place will turn into a heaven for the Ryuseikai gangs. I don't care about the Naha people. (Naha is okinawa's Capital City) I just can't stand the Yamatos. (The Yamatos' are a Mainland gang) -- What can we do? okinawa has reverted to Japan. -- I never agreed to anything! The reversion is their problem. It must've been a good deal for you. You've certainly benifited from it. Brother, haven't you told the young ones why I went to prison? Ishikawa. Apologise to brother. Apologize! Wait! Wait. I will tell him. Sit down. Seven years ago, I killed two men. The reason you are able to comfortably make a living without worries... is because of those two murders. -- Right, Bro? -- Yes, that's true. You guys remember that. That's why I... When I got out of prison... I was looking forward to half of Koza being mine. I understand, Bro. Leave it all to me. Bro... It's been 2 months since you've said that. I have 30 young ones working for me. I can't make them starve themselves any longer. Hey, Bro... Could you give it some thought? Koza City holds the biggest American Military Base in the Far East. It's a nightlife mecca. It is the embodiment of post-war Okinawa. Hiroki Matsukata Tsunehiko Watase Megumi Shindo Jiro Yabuki For many years, The Kunigami, Chadan, and Nakaguku gangs shared the territory, but in 1 968, Nakazato and his disciples, including Seizi Chihara, eliminated The Chadan and The Nakaguku gangs, and captured Koza city. Nakazato took the entire rap and he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. But, as okinawa reverted to Japan, a gang from mainland Japan began to emerge. As a result, the Kunigami gang from Koza and the oshiro gang from Naha... formed a grand alliance against the mainlanders. This is how the okinawa Allied Ryusei Group was formed in 1 97 1. However, this irregular institution, headed by Seigo Kunigami and Chogo oshiro, was inherently unstable, as if it were a volcano that could explode anytime. okinawa Yakuza War Naha City How's Mommy? Pissed off. Write to her once in a while. Meh. Been too busy. Hiroshi, be good when you're in front of the father. Eh, I beg of you. "Skeletal remains found under Cenotaph" It's Seiji. I went to the police station to look at his belongings. His Iimbs were mutilated. And his skull was plastered. Seiji was tortured to death. Ishikawa, you said someone saw Seiji in osaka? Well, that's what the one of young ones said... I must speak to him. -- He died last year. -- Ishikawa... Is there something you're not telling me? I don't know anything. Couldn't it have be an accident? You think someone can "accidentally" be ripped apart like that? Brother... There won't be a funeral until his death is avenged. Could you help look for the suspects, too? Yeah, sure. I'm against splitting up the territory. Nakazato is a scary man. You know this better than anyone. -- Move! -- Sister! Are you okay? Jeez... oh, jeez. Ishikawa, was it you who killed Seiji? Be honest with me! Chief... Let's get rid of Nakazato, too. otherwise, you two will end up killing each other! Ishikawa... I don't care how many petty criminals like Seiji you kill, but don't do anything to my brothers! -- Hey, water! -- Yes. I won't let you get away with it. Understand, eh? "Ice" our brother... was killed by Ishikawa. There's no question about it. We were in hell when you weren't here, and... Boss... Let's kill Ishikawa. We can't beat them. They have 200 men. We have 30. But... I can't just sit here and do nothing, knowing that he killed my brother. And we can't earn at this rate either. We have no choice but to trust our brother. Just wait a little longer. I Iearned to do that in prison. Welcome back! Good to see you back. Ryo has a guest for you. Boss, this is Hiroshi Kategaru. We've known each other since elementary school in Kumejima. He said he came here to become a man. What were you doing back on the island? Bakery factory. He was always the best street fighter. If I told him to climb a tree, he was the best at that, too. -- He also has a drivers' license. -- It got suspended. Any family? You are from Kumejima, too, eh? That makes four of us from the islands: Boss, me, Jiro and you. Hey! When you said you were from an island, you meant the Philippines, right? -- No! I meant Kumejima! -- oh! Ya, right... Damn it, you idiot! Thank you! -- Hey. -- oh, jeez. Hiroshi! Work hard, start a family. Apparently, Jiro's wife earns $30. Listen, $30 a night! -- Hiroshi! -- Kill him! Kill him! Stop! Cut it out, guys! She's Nobuko. She works at the same shop I do. Hiroshi Hasegawa. My buddy. Cute, isn't he? -- Use the bed. -- Hey! C'mon let's go. My house isn't far away. Hey... Weren't you actually after someone like Sumiko? Hey, wait. Pay me up front. I mean money. You take money? What do you think? Were you hoping to get lucky? This isn't the island, you know. Here. You're hopeless. Sorry, you have to go. I don't wanna be cheap. Get out. Go. Go! Wow, are you ok? Should I call the doctor? I just need a little rub. To the right, yeah... ouch... What is this? Hiroshi, I heard that you slept with a girl yesterday. -- You're pretty sneaky, aren't ya? -- Nice. Who is she? Hey! -- What do you think you are doing?! -- Cut the crap. That's our question. -- Can't you see? We have business here! -- Shut it! Your territories are on that side of the street! -- We recently got 2 contracts on this side. -- That's not our problem. You know what would happen to you if the Chief finds this out? I'II risk it! I'm not as patient as my brother! Satoru, fuck this. Run the car. Yes! Brother... Shut up! They monkey around with us if we look scared. If we act with confidence, they really aren't worth sweating over. Gushikawa, does my husband know that you are doing business up there? No... Be careful, there's no way Kunigami will keep quiet about this if he knew. They asked for it. our man is supposed to be controlling the area anyways. That's right! It's obvious. -- Exactly! -- Yeah! Gushikawa! -- Come with us. -- Now! Damn you! -- Stop! -- Yo! Stop it! Ishikawa, tell us what this is all about. This has got nothing to do with you. Well, I'll get Nakazato then. -- Ryo-san, please. -- Yes. Alright! I'll come with you! Chief, I'm sorry for making a quarrel with them earlier. But at this rate... I... I have a family to feed! I'm in a fix! You do know... what happens to those who violate the territory, don't you? I don't care what happens to me. Chief, think of me as standing up for my brother, and the young ones. Brother! This is our rule! We have to take him out. Killing won't be enough... No! open up! Nakata! Please, open this door! -- open it. -- open the door! open it! Stop him! Brother... Did you know about Gushikawa's territory invasion? Answer me... Gushikawa! Boss! It was so... mortifying. I couldn't let this be. Idiot! Gushikawa! I'm ashamed of myself. I didn't know that you were such a good-for-nothing. Brother... Sorry. I don't know how else to apologise. They don't understand you. I... I should have talked more with them... told them to have faith in you. Alright. Take him. Ishikawa, sorry about that. I owe you one. Chief, now you should know what to do. Ishikawa, give the brothers the Nakanomachi district. Chief! I wouldn't regret it even if my brother killed me. The strongest ones protect our land. That's how it should be. You might be ok with it, but I won't approve of that! Nakazato is just a murderer. I'm the one who led the group, and I'm the one who brought it up. I won't Iet Nakazato treat me Iike this! Chief! You have to make a choice! Me or Nakazato. If you can do this without me, kill me here now! You said it. Boss! Don't! Ishikawa! I'm the chief of Kunigami here. If you have any problem with the way I handle this, get out of my territory now! Hey! That asshole! -- Hey! -- Wait up! -- Dear, shouldn't you contact the office? -- No! Don't tell anyone about this. Boss! Testuo... Boss... How's Ishikawa! Did you do it? Boss, I just couldn't stand it. Forgive me... The police are after him. Tetsuo. Run to the North at once. No! I don't care what happens to me, but let me stay here. I have to finish him off. No! Your selfishness would just lead everyone into trouble. -- But, Boss... -- Tamotsu! Yes! Take him home. Yes. Listen. Stay on your island, untill I tell you to do otherwise. Now, go. How is Gushika-san? He is in stable condition. That's good to hear. I wonder what will happen to us now? No clue. Both my brother and Koza city have changed. I feel like I'm struggling in the dark. Dear, can't we stay this way? I'll work very hard. What about the young ones? They'll find their way. No, I can't let that happen. They were waiting for my return all this time when I was in prison. They are relying on me. Don't worry. I won't fight a match that I know I'll lose. Well, at the end, onaga is the one who will benefit the most from the Singing Competition. -- These events make good money. -- Give me a break. Chief, you own 3 hotels. Now how much profit are we looking at there? I would love it if the both of you held back this time, so that we can finally make some money. This is a God-given opportunity, for the deprived ones like us. Kunigami, do you have anything in mind for Koza? I'm not like you. I'm not skilled in making money. Oh, come on. You have the brain, Ishikawa. Why don't you build a hotel or two in Koza? Are you telling me to build hotels to accommodate the Yamatos? The speciality of the Shimizu Port... Who's he? He is someone from the mainland yakuza group. He's been bumming about, staying at the Royal Hotel for the last 5 days. He's famous for his Iavish use of moolah. He's famous for his Iavish use of moolah. -- What's he after? -- oh, I'm sure he's just here for tourism. Did you see, did you hear, the way he started a fight... Ishikawa, tell him to pay us a visit. Don't be so immature. I said, go! Kunigami-san, It's not the place nor time. Shut up. This is our land! You are being too loud. With my skill and my nerve, I never lose... Hey, what are you up to? Cut it out, Kunigami. Someone play the Sanshin. No! Ishikawa! Make him stop. At least they aren't actually fighting. Let him be. Who do you work for? Let me go! Kunigami-san. He's not just a no one. He is an executive from the Kansai Asahikai. Let the young ones turn themselves in, and we could fool the police, but Asahikai won't buy that. or worse, it could turn into an outright war with Asahikai! Then let's get on to it. I Ioooove wars. Are you out of your mind? They have 20 thousand people working for them. It's one of the biggest yakuza groups in the Mainland! In what world can we win over them? of course we can win. We had an actual war with few hundred thousand American Soldiers! Eh? Getting wasted in the bright sunlight, huh? Why don't you... Why don't you let go of that bottle already! Huh? Be happy! I finished Asahikawa to sober you guys up. The Singing competition and everything... you guys are becoming gutless! Where have the souls gone that made the Ryuseikai? Will we ever let the Yamato yakuzas set foor on our land? We made a vow! But Kunigami-san... The world is moving on. Bullshit! Are you happy with the Yamatos fucking over our lands? Huh? Not over my dead body... If I see the Yamatos put one foot into my land, I swear I will kill them all. That's messed up. Messed up? Huh? Huh? Huh? All I want to do... Do you have a problem with that? Do you? Have you problem with that? Have you a problem? If you do... you can come kill me anytime. That man is a little deluded I'm sorry to say this is front of you. When I asked him, if the Yamatos are so evil, what does that make the Americans? He answered that they've been enemies ever since the Battle of okinawa. He is just too messed up. So, how was it? Kudo-san... He passed away in osaka. No... I don't know about this. I'm not involved! So, I talked to Miyamura-san in Fukuoka, and he proposed that the only way is to beg the Kaizu Vice-chief. Nakazato-san, can you go to osaka as the representative for the Kunigami? Me? We'll pretend that Kunigami is sick or something. And you, as his little brother, have to go make an apology, or else we'd look bad. -- Who else would come with me? -- Well, the Head Chief would come, of course. No! That won't do. I'm not good with formalities. I have a doctor's order not to go on airplanes. I have high blood pressure. Blood pressure has nothing to do with airplanes. Plus... I was thinking of resigning the Head Chief position. Are you being serious? of course! I have decided to let the next in line take over my place. I leave you to deal with the osaka problem. Hideo! You should go. Go and become a man. I have no problem with that... but what are we telling my Brother? Don't say anything! He's a lunatic! Nakazato-san, we are fed up with Kunigami. He's old fashioned. Some say even Ishikawa is abandoning him. You shouldn't hesitate. If you accomplish this, all of Kunigami's men will follow you. Eh? This is a great chance. Don't you think? "osaka" About our misconduct... I don't know how we could pay for the loss. We understand that it's customary for Seigo Kunigami himself to pay the visit, but unfortunately he had a sudden seizure and... we brought Hideo Nakazato, his associate. I'm Hideo Nakazato. As I am a hick, I am not familiar with the manners of formal apology... but I have heard that we have to cut our fingers in these circumstances. I am prepared to have all 1 0 cut off if you wish so. Please do as you wish. For now we have 5 million yen. Please accept it. onaga-san, what are your plans after this? Um, nothing much. Then could you stay in osaka for a few days? We will find you accommodations. Good evening. What do you want? I've been sent here by Boss Kaizu. I was told to stay with you until morning. oh. come here. This way. -- oh my! Kaizu-san! -- oh. please, stay seated. I have been to the bereaved family of Kudou, but they wouldn't accept the money. -- So, I will return this to you. -- Heavens no! This belongs to you. So have you given any thoughts to... Kunigami's head. They say that's the only thing they want. onaga-san, if you get rid of Kunigami, you can unify Ryuseikai. If you become the Head Chief, then we can resume our relationship. I want you to become the Chief of the okinawa Branch of the Asahikai. The Branch Chief? Ryuseikai would become the okinawa branch of Asahikai...? onaga-san. You do realise that one of our execs was killed. Normally, we wouldn't be negotiating with you. You have two choices: to bring us Kunigami's neck, and be a part of Asahikai, or have an outright war. I need your reply now. Well, I personally have no problem siding with the Asahikai, but Kunigami is worse than what you imagine him to be. What if you used Nakazato? Nakazato? He is a man at heart. Isn't he the best man you have for getting rid of Kunigami? Welcome back, Boss! Welcome back. Dear, Kunigami-san is here. Brother! I heard you went to see the Chief of Asahikai. Why were you sneaking around? Eh? Were you plotting against me? Brother... Do you need the filthy hand of the Yamatos to kill me? Brother! That's not it. I went there as a scapegoat. I was prepared to die for you. I went to apologise to Chief Kaizen. Shut up! You apologised to Kaizen? Shame on you! Shame! Boss! Boss! Calm down! Say something! -- Stop! Please! -- Keep out of this! Stop! Stop! Brother... I never thought that you would become the dog of the Yamatos. It's to survive. Dog or pig... if that's the only way to survive. Nakazato! Get out of Koza within 24 hours with all your boys. If I find any of them around after that, I will beat them to death. Get it? Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! It's a 45. Hold it with two hands, Go up to Kunigami and fire. I chose you guys because you are both from the island. We have been looked down upon by the mainlanders on many occasions. Represent us... The Boss and I, and show them what we've got. Hiroshi! Come with me! Hey. Kunigami is at the bar street, drinking away. Make sure to contact me every 1 5 minutes. We will finish Kunigami off. Give me a drink of water, too. No matter what you want to tell us, there is no way for us to survive unless we bring him down. If you must, break off ties with me at this instance. Gushikawa... If you decide to act, don't fail. or else we are all going down. I will go to onaga. To Onaga? If we give Koza city to anyone else, my brother would turn over in his grave. Hiroshi! Kunigami's car is a Lincoln Continental. Be careful! Lincoln Continental... Lincoln Cont... Lincoln Con... Sorry to call you up like this. No problem. There was something I wanted to talk to you about, too. What is that? Well, I'll listen to your story first. It's about Kunigami. Well, that's exactly what we wanted to talk to you about. Nakazato-san, so, you are finally ready? Welcome? Miss, where is he? -- I think he's gone to play Pachinko. -- Hm, could you look for him? Don't worry. I just wanted to have a drink with him. Nakazato-san, if you are going to kill him, you've got all the support you need. Guns, money... you name it. You should do it. If you kill Kunigami, you will be the chief of Koza city. I need no guns or no money, but there is one thing I want from you. What is it? I want you guys, including oshiro-san, to not attend Kunigami's funeral. -- Not attend his funeral? -- What do you mean by that? I want you to show the public that it's the collective will of Ryuseikai to kill Kunigami off. I don't want to dance by myself. on that note, remove Ishikawa's name from our family. We need this sacrifice... to commemorate the death of Seiji, and the other young ones. Nakazato-san, you've got us. You are a truly scary man. Got it. No one from Naha will attend Kunigami's funeral. You have my word. I can't seem to get a hold of him... That's too bad. What about this? I will be at 'Universe' around Ginnnouan. Could you tell him to drop by, if you get the hold of him? There is something I want to give him. Miss, I got frustrated earlier today... but I'II take care of him and his brothers. Thank you. See you then. Ah, Gushikawa-san? Kunigami-san really wants to see him. I think he... Thank you. 'Universe' at Ginnouan... I'll make sure to pass on the message. Hiroshi! Hey! Hiroshi! That idiot where the hell is he? Hiroshi! Hey! My brother is coming soon, so leave him a seat. You guys go drink somewhere there. Hurry up! Your faces make my drink go bad! You seem frustrated. Yeah, I'm excited for the feast with my brother. Hello. Hey, dear, why don't you sing us a song? -- A Song? -- Yes! Alright, then! The "Hachikusa" flies high, flies high above Iwate Mountain... then we became the captives of the Americans. How pitiful is a P.O.W... What is this song? It's a song called P.W (Prisoner of War) It's about the prison camps. A while ago, okinawa became a battlefield. Look at the tears of the Okinawans... How pitiful is a P.W. Who the fuck are you? My brother... You filthy... Boss! Boss! Come! Brother! Brother! Dear... Who is it? Is it you, dear? What the hell? Not Iike this. Bite the bullet. It's a good bye. What? Why? I killed a man. I have to turn myself in soon. Honey! Honey... Cremation of Seigou Kunigami Damn, it's so hot out there! -- Get me a glass of cold beer. -- Yes. Hello, this is onaga Construction. Wait a moment, please. It's Hideo Nakazato. He's been calling for a while now... Tell him I'm not here. Hideo! What are you talking about? It's natural for I as a boss to attend another boss' funeral. What? From onaga? No, onaga didn't say anything about boycotting the funeral. Plus, onaga, too. He was there, too, looking sad. Where are you anyways? Northern Area: Nago I tell you, Ishikawa and the cops will be after us. You damn traitors... How can I trust you! Damn it! onaga is playing with us. The rumours are true. Everyone from the Chief and down attended the funeral. Have no worry... We'll start with Ishikawa... and kill women and children. Everyone! Welcome Back, Boss! Share this among you guys. -- Thank you, Boss! -- Thank you, Boss! I can't become Chief, unless I avenge our brother. It's in your interest, too. Fight till you die. Yes, Boss. Everyone is a part of the Suicide attack units from today. Find everyone from Nakazato on down and kill them all! Gino Port Police Station Break a leg! Is it really going to be alright? Won't they be suspiscious? It won't be if you... Iook sexy enough. Hey. It's for you. Administrator? I need to shit! What? Shitting in the middle of your dinner? What? Shitting in the middle of your dinner? You nasty piece of... Can't you see the gun? Yuji! Get in! You went too far. But... thanks. It's for not selling me out to the cops. Plus you have guts. our boss can use the help. That's my line. Where is he now anyways? He's at the house of Tetsuo Nagao. Listen, I will slow down. Jump out of the car, and go to Nagao's. I will take care of the rest. We have a case here, of a man named Hiroshi Kategaru charged for murder. He escaped from jail as he fired a gun at the police officers this afternoon. Kategaru escaped with an accomplice who handed him the gun... He did it, eh? It's Jiro! It's got to be him! ...has evolved into the tragic car accident between the car and the 2 pursuing police cars. However the bodies of the suspects have not been found. The police are looking into the possibility that suspects are still at large. They did it! The police seem pretty flustered. Mom! We need more drinks. Beat it down... Kill it... Ishikawa... Kill him. Kill... He's right. We take him down or we're dead. We need money. We need cash to get weapons. Show me what we have so far. Beat it... Kill... Kill... Kill... We'd be lucky to survive 5 days. -- At least we won't have to worry about food here... -- Hey, no. We can't keep causing your mother trouble. Pay them back from the money we have now. -- But we're family. -- No. Don't talk. Who is it? Hiroshi! Hiroshi! -- Are you alright? -- Hiroshi! Hiroshi! Give me food... I'm... starving. -- Give him something to eat. -- Mom! Food! -- Give him a drink. -- Okay. Where's Jiro? I don't know, but from now on, I'II work... for Jiro, too. Ishikawa or whoever. I'm beating them up. So what was it that you wanted to tell me? Good bye. Bye? Where are you off to? I decided to sell myself to the Tokyo Brothel. I called the place. I'll send Tetsuo with 300 thousand yen. No! I haven't plunged as far as to sell my wife. But I've already made my decision, and I'd only be a drag if I were here. But... you... But you need money. If you don't buy the weapons, you.. and all of you... will be killed, right? 300 thousand yen won't change the tide. Stay out of it. But... I've really made my decision. Tokyo Brothel Get in! Where is Nakazato? Speak! I don't know! I don't know anything! You are going to remain silent, huh? Idiot! Killing isn't the way to get information out of him! -- He was being so stubborn... -- Damn it! What's done is done. Find someone else! Wow. Hey! I'll buy you some hotties today. Don't tell Ishikawa. Yes, Boss! Can I use a mirror? You shouldn't. Your skin is all peeled off. I see. I guess that won't make me any whiter, will it? Bye! No action for a long time, huh? By the way, That money in the jar... Can I borrow it? That money in the jar... Can I borrow it? -- No. That'll be the end of it. -- oh, don't say that. No! It's the next most precious thing, next to my life. C'mon. -- Hey! -- Move away! It's mine! You whore! You son of a bitch! Hey! Chase him! Kill him! Idiot! So what about him? The owner of the Gaijin Bar. The gay guy called Kaera. -- Yeah. -- That fag owes us money from before. -- How much does he owe us? -- About 200 thousand yen. We can buy some vehicles with that. Collect it from him tomorrow. Hey! Hello! Hi! It's our Iast scotch. Want some? -- C'mon, sit, Sit down, sit down. -- Dancho, you will pay us the full amount. ok, ok, yes. Give me a glass. Someone is getting it for me now. Here. It's a dull time for you guys, huh. Don't be shy. Drink away! Take this as the interest I owe you. Run! Throw away the gun! It's about time. Isn't it too big for a tomb of three? Hey! Where's Nakazato? Where is he hiding? Don't tell him. He'II kill us no matter what. I won't kill you guys if you tell me where he is. If one speaks, we'll let all three of you go. No! No! Kill us now! Help me! Help me! Help! Hey. I will give you one last chance. -- Where is Nakazato? -- I don't know! You bastard... Help me! Help me! Help me! I'II speak! Help me! Speak! Tetsuo Naguro... Naguro's home! Hey, help him out. Hey, where are they? Where did they go? Don't. He wouldn't have told them. Hitoshi! It's just as we thought. All three of them were killed. Some people say they've seen the scene. What? Is it something about Nakazato? -- Yes. Someone has seen him around here. -- Don't worry. I asked him to come here. What? Why do that? He made a call to Osaka. I see, now he's begging you, huh? Kaizu-san, don't take him seriously. He's as good as dead. Depending on the situation, wouldn't it be interesting to bring him back to life? But as the war prolongs, the police could become pesky... And we as Ryuseikai wouldn't be too happy about it, either. Hey. Kaizu-san... Spare some money for me. Please. I beg you! I will get weapons, and kill Ishikawa and all. onaga-san, as you said... If I become the chief and get my hands on the North from Koza, we can stabilise okinawa. Kaizu-san. I promise this won't be a bad deal for you, too. I approve. I will give you the money. on one condition... That you will put your plans into action. Understood? Thank you. 'Munukyuusugowaushuu' There's a saying in okinawa that the one to follow is the one who gives. What that really implies is that the follower will never be truly loyal to the master. That's a universal truth. Ishikawa must be as equally as bothersome as Nakazato is to you. -- Well that's... -- Which means... that 5 million yen acts as an investment for you too. This is a fine jeep! What about the weapons? We bought tons. The Americans are losing in Vietnam, so they can't care less. They'll steal anything for us if we pay them. Boss! You look exactly like Kunigami-san, our dead boss. You... That's not a thing to say. Kill them all! Kill them! Kill! Kill! Gincho! Hitoshi! Gincho! Etsuko! Get the gun! Wait! Wait a minute... Killing me won't do any good. Someone will get to you one day, too. Spare me! Now with Ishikawa dead, and the ex-Kunigami group in shambles... we don't need the Chief for the Northern, and the Middle part anymore. We should abolish the system and I want you to be the Chairman. Forthat, I couldn't care Iess. But I... -- I just want to resign. -- You're kidding! You are the one, with the wealth and the reputation, who can lead Ryuseikai. Don't have an old hag like me as a chief. You can take the position. Anyhow, I have talked to all the other Chiefs. It's our final decision. Yes, yes. oh, Nakazato. Yeah, I was waiting for your call. You know what happened to Ishikawa. Call the meeting at once, and make me the Head Boss. Say what? Cops? You can't seriously expect those dickheads to get me? We can attack your office anytime. You've gone mad! Your group is almost in shambles, too. And all you have are two, three petty criminals! So much for becoming the Head Chief! Plus, we don't need a Head Chief anymore. Oshiro-san has just accepted the offer to become Chairman. We will unify Ryuseikai under his rule from now on! -- I haven't said anything yet! -- Either way, once we get rid of the violent ones from Koza City, Ryuseikai would become equivalent of an economic institution, and if you became the chairman of that institution, that's an honourable post! -- Hold on a minute! -- To realise this, we should call an emergency meeting, and we need to expel Nakazato's name from the book. -- In reality we must get rid of him. -- But then he will make me his target! He is more of a mad dog than Kunigami ever used to be. Yes, but he's one mad dog. He can't do any harm to us. -- The cops will get him soon enough. -- But I... If you are still worried, we will secure your home safe and sound. Really? onaga, you are all I have. -- I'm counting on you. -- Sure, sure.

Chief, the area is clear. -- For real? -- For real. over! Alright. C'mon, George. Let's go for a walk then. C'mon. This way. George! George! George! Where are you running to, George? George! Hurry. Chairman! George! George! George! George! This should be enough cash. Pay them back and quit the job. And what if I do? It's alright. I'll be alright. What are you talking about? Take it. You still haven't stopped killing. You probably never will... Even if it costs your life. And even if you survive, the cops will be after you. Buying me back won't change anything. If... If they don't get you, come see me... Just as my visitor. oshiro-san was very unlucky. It's as if he was sent to the guillotine with the Chairman's badge. Who would have expected that? okinawa... is such a scary place. I hope this friendly association will continue between us. I want our relationship to be... what's the word again? Ah, 'convivial'. That's what we'd say. Please, show us mercy We defer to the mainland people in these matters. Hey! It's him! That Bastard! What's happening?! Shit... That kid... oh my good, old Okinawa... Turned into a battlefield... Turned into a battlefield... The Okinawan sacrifices... Those tears flow... Those tears flow... End
