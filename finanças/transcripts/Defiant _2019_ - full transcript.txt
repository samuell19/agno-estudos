Take a deep breath. Is that getting worse? I don't know about worse. It's certainly not getting any better. You always wear your mask? You're around 'em a lot, the more you breathe that in the worse it's gonna get. You can't keep breathing the same air as them and not expect to be affected. Take a puff. It's been about three and a half years since the Taking. I don't really remember much before then. They say the amnesia wears off eventually, but I don't feel it yet. Just some weird dreams here and there. How's the head? Still nothing. I had this dream. You had giant eagle wings, you were carrying me upside down by your talons. Which is a super weird thing to say to your doctor. It's not even the weirdest thing I've heard today. I know very few things for sure. I know my parents died in the car crash that took my memory. I know our world is just finally beginning to know peace. Our sovereign leader came to us when we needed him most. I know my name is A51-317. It's in our best interest to try not to remember the old world. The hate is contagious. Well, keep your mask on while you're working. We need you guys in the field. If he's for us? Who can be against us. I know we must protect our new world at any cost. I know the Taking purged much of the old world filth. But others rise up in their place. Many are left that would destroy our peace if they could. The forbidden book teaches them to hate. That's why we do what we do. Someone has to keep the evil out. I know for sure I'm no different than any other citizen. I trust our sovereign leader when he says that if he is for us, who can be against us? Do we make ourselves clear? That's right. You didn't even know. I fooled all of you. Red, shut up. Is that it? Anybody else with a weapon? I asked a question. I take it he's with you. Please don't. Please. He's her brother. He's her brother. Red. Shut up. A brother? It's always nice to see families sticking together. Uh-oh. What do we have here? Looks like somebody's been naughty. It's okay, buddy. It's gonna be okay. Don't do that. Don't give him hope. You people don't deserve hope. Beg. Please. He's all I have left. Shh. He's not all you have left. You... have... nothing. Burn the books. I don't care what you do with the women. But make the men watch. I demand execution. What did you just say? C55. I have nothing illegal in my possession. The only thing I'm guilty of, is association. I am entitled to execution by him. We bring her. You think you're real smart, don't ya? You know we're gonna have to search you, right? To verify that you don't have any contraband on you? And we're real thorough. Paul. You didn't have to get me anything. You've hardly been gone. Kill them all before they talk. You will not regret this. What was that back there? She demanded execution. We do what he sees best. Is that understood? Hey. You know I love you, right? No matter what. You didn't have to get me anything. You know I love you? Hardly been gone. No matter what. No matter what. I love you, Paulie. You're gonna be a messenger. You're gonna bring people good news. Paul. Sacred father, may our sovereign leader live forever. That he shall, my child. I can't believe it's you. How am I so privileged to have you in my presence? Be encouraged, he is with you. Mighty warrior. I come with glad tidings. - I'm so sorry, sacred father. - I see region housing hasn't lost any of its charm. Bit of a cooking mishap? Yeah, I was attempting a new recipe. Be not ashamed, child. We've all burned things we desired to try. You are A51-317, yes? Yes, your grace. And you live alone? Yes, sacred father, most of our teams do, to help maintain focus on our task. Which I'm sure you already knew that. I'm sorry. Very wise, my son. Lust of this world only distract us from our unadulterated worship of him. Must take the kingdom first. All the rest will be given to you as well. It's what we aim for, your grace. I hope you don't think we've fallen short. Of course not. We know you're a good and faithful servant. As I said, we come with glad tidings. Your time has come. He has requested your presence. Who? The king of kings and Lord of Lords. The sovereign leader is here. A51-317, I presume. Come. Follow me. Do you thirst? I'm fine, your sovereignty. Thank you. Drink, son, you look parched. I have many great plans for our new world. Plans that prosper us, to give us a hope and a future. And the way I desire for my plans to unfold is with the involvement of my people. Only the people called by my name will prosper. And my people must soon be sealed in my name. You understand what I mean, A51? No, your sovereignty, I don't. You will. Soon. As you know, I'm a very hands on man. I prefer to do all the executions myself, but sadly it's not a possibility. Which is why I need the dedicated. It's why I need men like you. On this current execution tour, I've been traveling throughout all of the regions asking a few of my elect to step up into their rightful roles in the coming days. We'll need to work together more than ever in the next hours of our world. Anything, your sovereignty. Absolutely anything. Good. Perhaps I'm stepping out on a limb here, but I summoned you here to offer you a new position in my administration. I'd like for you to take over my world preservation operations in all the region. Everyone who is opposed to peace in the five surrounding cities will be dealt with by your team, chosen and led by you, and as you succeed, the opportunity for advancement is limitless. Your sovereignty, I-- I am beyond honored. I'm no one. I don't deserve a place in your leadership. I see so much potential in you, A51. Do not doubt yourself. My power is made perfect in your weakness. A power that has yet to be displayed to the world. Do you believe that? Do you believe in my power? Don't feel like you have to answer right away. We'll be in touch. Take heart, my son. I am for you. I wouldn't accept his offer if I were you. Dr. A6? Put the gun down, Paul. What are you doing here? I'm glad to see my makeup and fake cough has fooled you all these years. I guess you can call me Harold now. You're defiant? Why? That question has so many answers. But it boils down to a true understanding of a few certain words. Peace, hate... love. To believe in a word is not the same as knowing and believing in its meaning. Don't move. I swear to God I'll kill you. I don't know what you're doing, but I am required to kill you if you don't help me understand right now. The girl, Esther, that you took this morning, is part of a special group of defiants I lead. Her brother is the young boy you watched die. I need you to help us get her back. Your memories, they're getting worse, aren't they? Shut up. Just shut up. So you were just spying on me the whole time? Oh, it's much more than that. - We think it's time, Paul. - Stop calling me that. Tell me, did you remember the entire book all at once? Or is it coming back to you in pieces? Not our first rodeo, kid. It's not our intention to hurt you, despite what you might believe. You ready to talk? Got nothing to say to you. Traitor. Except I hope you thought through every angle of this, 'cause they're going to come for me. They don't want you, Paul. You are in so over your head. The sovereign leader offered me a promotion, personally, to kill all of you. I know. It's not for why you think. They found out things about you. They know who you really are. They know that your memory's beginning to return. We want you to join us, Paul. That's what this is about? Oh, oh, this is my welcome party then, huh? Tell me, what would possess you to believe that I would join you? You recognize her? I'm gonna kill you! Let me out, you have no idea what you're doing. You're the one with the forbidden book and the illegal old world photo in your house. Oh, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you, and I'm gonna make it slow. I'm gonna find your wife and kids, I'm gonna make you watch. Did you ever have a dog? Did you ever have a dog? Do you know where you lived before they moved you to region housing? - What was your favorite color? - Let me out. You know about you what they tell you about you. So far that's been your greatest asset. Your sovereign leader wanted you because you're a clean slate. You're the perfect follower because you have no idea who you are. But all that changed when you began to remember. They're trying to contact him. We need to get him back. Oh, no. We were just getting to the good part. Very soon, your sovereign leader's gonna be murdered, through a fatal wound to his head. Probably a gunshot. We believe he may even arrange it himself. Three and a half days later, he's gonna rise from the dead and claim to be God. We'll see you soon, Paul. This is A51-317, I lead Peace Team Gallica 3 in Region 5. Password you're about to ask for is rainbow scepter. I have reason to believe that there will be an attempt on the sovereign leader's life in the very near future. What... Do you hear me? I believe the sovereign leader of the new world is gonna be assassinated. Hello? This will just be our secret. I promise not to tell Dad if you don't. And when you come and dig this up someday, always remember, it's for you first and then the rest of the world. It has to be in that order. You first and then the rest of the world. You have got to be kidding me right now. Ma'am, I don't think you understand the gravity of what you're doing right now. I work for the sovereign leader and have reason to believe his life is in danger. Let me use your phone. I know who you are. A51-317. You're not using the phone. You're not going anywhere. To be honest, I'm afraid if I move, I just might kill you myself. What? We're gonna wait right here for the government men to show up and give me my reward and give you what you deserve. Ma'am, I don't know who you think I am, but you are clearly confused. People of the new world I'm back. Ma'am? - I hear a lot has happened the last three days. - Ma'am. - Quiet. - Sorry I've missed out. Obviously I don't mean to make light of what has happened. I know it's been a very trying and burdensome time for many of you. I'd like to tell you that one of our own has betrayed us. But in reality we've been infiltrated by impostors. As many of you know, three days ago I was shot in the head and confirmed dead by several physicians by the defiant terrorist known as A51-317, assisted in the completion of his treasonous act - by Dr. A6-RB19, a local peace team physician. - How'd that work out for you? These men pretended to be like us so that they become a part of our system, all the while plotting against us. So many of these hateful groups have remained in our new world far longer than we should've allowed them to. It was only a matter of time before they did something drastic. So for the security of our new world, it is in our best interest that true citizens of the new world from here on out be distinctly identifiable. No more of these hateful murderers getting into our stores and our hospitals, our schools, and our homes. From here on out, those who choose to live by peace will receive my seal, on their right hand or their forehead. In an effort to expedite the process and ensure your safety, you will unfortunately not be able to buy or sell without it, but region peace teams and police will be available at every major retailer, hospital, and world preservation center, allowing for quick and simple access so that those of you who choose peace can get on with your everyday lives as quickly as possible. And as some of you have suspected, I am the God of all creation, the long awaited savior... ...will rise from the dead and claim to be God. And I have come up to my people because I saw your pain. I have come so that you might have abundant life. Let me release you from your pain and your death, my people. Let the God of all comfort comfort you. - For I so loved the world... Region 5 Police, ma'am. Open up! - ...whoever believes in me... - I hope they televise your execution. ...shall not perish... I want to see you pay for what you did. ...but have everlasting life. I have brought you everlasting life. Thank you, ma'am we'll take it from here. Defiant scum. Hey, what about my reward? As soon as you receive your seal, ma'am, it'll be deposited into your account. I didn't do this. You're making a big mistake. It doesn't matter. You're defiant now. You? Why are you doing this to me? We didn't do anything. And you're welcome for busting you out. You were minutes away from a televised beheading. They know it wasn't me. I'll just tell them it was you. It wasn't us, we took you back to your house that night. Everybody wave. Just kidding. Please don't. Look, you don't have to do this. - Let me out and I promise not to pursue you. - Paul. - I'm not gonna come after you. - Paul. The whole world thinks you killed him. The only one who can prove you didn't is the guy you supposedly killed. If they ever find you, he will execute you on live television, knowing full well you're innocent. You don't make any sense. Why would he frame me? To make defiants look like terrorists. To have a reason to push the seal. Defiants already look that way. If that's all he needed, he could've blamed any one of you, the whole world would've believed it. But if it came from the inside, he could call it a security breach. He could scare them into thinking that everyone around them might be defiant. It's all about the seal. You're a scapegoat, kid. Doesn't make any sense. Just identifying citizens is not that important. Oh, it's much more important than you realize right now. Do you all actually believe this garbage? Or do you just not like following rules? It's not about rules, kid. It's about history. It's about being on the right side when it's written. What if you chose wrong? What if we're right? Either way, you'll just have to trust us. You're in no position to make demands. Not to mention you've been off the grid for three days. Your Region 5 rifle was used to kill him, and they found that book in your house with the picture of your defiant mother inside. Where? Where what? The book, where is it? Unless they burned it already it's still at your house, where we left you and it. It's still there, but there's a few guys camped out at the house. We may or may not have bugged your house. Just being honest. We have to go back. Did you miss the part about not making demands? Look, you hate me and that's fine. But I have to have that book. We're not going back there, that's a death wish. Please. The picture. I'll do anything. Please. Will you read it? If we get the picture, will you read the book? Yeah. I don't hate you, kid. But you better have a good plan. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, we got you. It's just up here. Ok, I didn't bring my full bag of tricks, because this kind of got sprung on me, so I hope you're fine with winging it. What are you doing? All region housing has an electronics override outside the house, just in case. In case of what? In case we want someone in the dark. See? If somebody would've told me ahead of time, that this was the plan, I have a perfectly good EMP back home. - A lot less digging. - Caden, how do you use this thing? Very carefully. Don't point it at anyone you don't want in serious pain. As soon as it's turned on, their ears are toast, as well as their balance. Hopefully. Okay, there's one in the house and two parked outside. Here we go. That's far enough right there, sir. Oh, absolutely. You can never be too careful around here. Reggie. Don't, buddy. Come on, it's not worth it. Paul. I'm okay, I just tripped. Pretty impressive, right? It almost completely disguises my thermal image from your stupid little drone. C55, I didn't do it. You know at first, I'll be honest, it was really hard for me to believe. Three years. Three years we raided together, and never once did I question your loyalty. And then it hit me the other day. Never do I remember you ever pulling the trigger. Not once. You always found a way to have one of us do it. C55... Shut up. I stood by you for three years, and the whole time you were just plotting your betrayal. You were so quick to help them when they demanded execution. You were trying to save them. Think about this. I didn't save any of 'em, they were all executed. I don't know that. I didn't see that happen. I'll take the seal right now. Does that sound like defiant to you? They think that's the end. I know he'll believe me if I can just talk to him. He doesn't want to talk to you. Best case scenario, you can say sorry when his machete touches the back of your neck. C55, I'll do anything. How many? Two. Are they armed? Not lethally. Kill them. Kill them, and you get to spend one more day in our world. Don't touch it, Reggie. Whoa, kid. What are you doing? Whatever I have to do to clear my name. You know that won't work. You're dead as soon as they take you in. What's it gonna be, A51? Paul. Don't do this. Hey, what did your dad say? Don't do that. We don't shoot people, even if we're pretending. A51? Paul, don't do this. Make up your mind quickly, or else I'll kill all of you with a smile on my face. Kid, you don't have to do this. Everyone just shut up. You don't have to do this anymore. Sorry I'm late, I thought you just needed a little extra time. Why'd you do that, Reggie? It was a stupid thing to do. We have to go, they're almost here. I saw the heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called faithful and true. In righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has names written, and the name written which no one knows but he himself. He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is called The Word of God, the armies which are in heaven follow him on a white horse, clothed in white, pure, fine linen. Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp double-edged sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the almighty. He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. We have plenty of firewood. Do you like ravioli? You've got to eat something, Paul. It's been a long day. You know I killed him, right? Did you gather that from all the holes in the story they fed you? Yes, I understand that. Harold has a hard time telling a complete story at times like these. He tends to try to protect the heart rather than tell the full truth. Do you like pasta? I've been trained to recognize poison. Just eat. So what's with the tree? It's dying. Carpenter ants in the roots. How can you tell? They leave sawdust behind. Okay. I'll leave you to your tree. It's... How long were you and Reggie married for? We were actually at our wedding reception during the Taking. Do you have children? I had a son, and Reggie had two daughters. They were in the raid with the boy and the girl. Reggie, for what it's worth, died honorably. I was aiming for Harold and he jumped in front of it, to try and protect him. I know my Reggie. And I don't think he was trying to protect Harold. Paul. Caden. Oh, scared the crap out of me. What do you want? Scared the crap out of me, what do you want? Caden, go to bed. That was the plan till you pumped me full of adrenaline. Paul. Caden, this is not funny. Not even close, bro. Paul. Paul. Paul. I am for you, Paul. Paul. Show yourself! Not yet. But I'm not going to hurt you, Paul. It's time. Oh yeah? What's it time for? To remember. Do you want to remember? What do you want from me?! I make all things new. Remember, Paul. Remember. What do you see? My mother. She's getting us dressed for something. I'm just a boy, about six or seven. Who was with you, Paul? A little girl. About the same age as me. And a baby, boy. Paul, only I am for you. Remember that I am for you. Now we're driving, it's more recent, like a few years ago. I am for you, Paul. They're arguing about something in the front. We're about to crash. I reach over to help. The boy and girl. It's okay, Paul. I am for you. Who are you? I am, Paul. I am. You're gonna bring good news. You're gonna bring good news. How could you not tell me? You got some serious anger issues you need to take care of, kid. How could you not tell me? Oh, so you're actually gonna shoot me this time? Harold, don't push him. Paul, you need to relax, talk to us. I swear my nightmares are better than real life lately. So what exactly did I not tell you? The boy and girl from the raid. The last two people I sentenced to death. They were my brother and sister. Well, look whose memory's coming back. So you knew? Is that all you remember? Why, am I missing a few details? You're missing the fact that you're pretending to all of a sudden care about something you think you know. I saw them! I remember! Maybe they were at one time. But not anymore. Now they're defiants, and you're A51-317, leader of Peace Team Gallica 3 of Region 5, isn't that right? So why do their lives matter to you? What makes now so different? Who are you, kid? Only you can make that decision, but don't make it for them. You make that decision because you know that I Am called you by name. I deserve to die. Harold. If that's what he said to you, then pull the trigger. I know you don't think I'll do it, but I have nothing. Everyone I have is gone. Then you should probably pull the trigger. Harold. Would it ease your pain? No, Paul. He's always gonna be gone in this life, and I'll always have to face that. Please don't. Paul. What do you believe in, Paul? I honestly believe I deserve to die for the things I've done. You do. But you don't have to. That's the beauty of it. I'm so sorry. It's okay. You didn't know what you were doing. I don't understand. You never will. Just please don't kill any more of us. So what now? We get your sister back. Wake up, Esther. Bend your arms. Wake up, sweetheart. Bend your arms. I can't anymore. Yes, you can, come on, don't give up on me. How can you still do this? I need water. When was the last time we ate? We just had those steaks last night. That's not funny. Thank you, Lord, for another day. Come on, Esther, take a deep breath. Thank you, Lord, for another day. Thank you, Lord, for another day. Thank you, Lord, for another day! Thank you, Lord, for another day! Shut up in there. Thank you, Lord, for another day. We are blessed to have been counted worthy. I had an incredible dream last night, Esther. They're coming. I believe they're here already. Finish strong, sweetheart, finish strong. What, who? ¶ When peace like a river ¶ ¶ Attendeth my wake ¶ Rachel, who's here? ¶ When sun rose like Sea billows ¶ I said shut up! ¶ But ever my light ¶ - Rachel. - ¶ Thou has thought me to say ¶ Rachel. ¶ It is... ¶ What did I say about singing? Another week without food. I had food to eat you don't know about. Search the cell. What do I do with him? He can take her spot. She's not coming back. What are you doing? Sovereign leader isn't here yet. ¶ And Lord haste the... ¶ Rachel! You understand, I'm not gonna have an uprising on the day we're understaffed. ¶ When the faith Shall be sight ¶ Walk. Where is he taking her? Rachel! You. Here to finish what you started? What are you doing, don't touch me. I'm so sorry. I know this doesn't make any sense, but I need you to trust me right now. Why would I ever trust you? 'Cause you and I are the only family we have left. You can join us or you can stay. The choice is yours. I'm in, what do you need? To leave, now. Come on. Backup could show up anytime. We can't leave Rachel. They just took her, we should get her. - There's no time. - We can't leave her, they're gonna kill her! Keep your voice down. It's too late. ¶ It is well ¶ ¶ It is well ¶ ¶ With my soul ¶ ¶ With my soul ¶ ¶ It is well ¶ ¶ It is well with my soul ¶ Eat something. What's your name? Adam. I'm Paul, that's Harold, Christina, that's my sister Esther over there. Hi. Thanks for rescuing me. Not fully rescued yet. What's your story? My parents were survivalists. We've been hiding out, living off whatever we could. Where are they now? Dead. We ran into some old friends recently who had shifted their loyalties. Apparently that's legal now. They took me instead. Where do your loyalties lie? What do you mean? Why haven't you become a citizen? My father never really trusted him, I guess. The leader. I mean, you've heard some of the stuff he says. Or does. Something's not right with that. Right? That's not normal behavior. Have you seen their eyes? And what's with their masks? Their leader tells them that they're allergic to us. The serum in their mask makes them cough, convincing them that they're allergic to us. Their eyes are what you look like when hope has been ripped from your soul. It doesn't feel good. You still never answered his question, though. Where do your loyalties lie? I guess with whoever has answers. Like real answers. But until then, with you guys. I owe you my life, and I have no one left. Look, this isn't a survivalist group. We have a very specific mission that we've been preparing for for a long time. We feel like you're better off not being with us at this point. This is the safest I've been in years. I'll do anything you guys want. Adam, trust me... Do you have any special skills? I'm not gonna throw an orphan back on the street. Do you have any useful skills? I like to make stuff. Cool. Okay. Let's get started. Not you. Read this first. What is it? Answers. You want to be friends? I can't imagine how you must feel. I feel angry. Annoyed that you expect me to believe you couldn't recognize your own family. I recognized you that day. As soon as you said my name, I remembered. Something. Just not enough. Well, I suppose now that you remember, we can just be one big happy family again. - Es-- - Don't call me that. I don't know how to forgive you. I know. I'm not expecting you to. I've been beaten and tortured, more times than I can even count. Today was the first time in almost a week that I've eaten anything. And it doesn't even compare to how it felt to watch Jacob die. I couldn't remember his name. What was he like? He was funny. Weird. The only one who ever got your awful jokes. And he looked up to you way more than he should've. You did a great job looking out for him. All alone, I can't imagine. Just sucks, you know. Feels like they've won. Didn't Mom used to say something about losing? If you pick the right team, you'll never lose. Yeah. And then Dad would say, "unless you picked the losers." Do you remember him? No, not at all. What was he like? You're not missing much. You're not so bad. For a little brother. Are you the oldest? I could probably convince you of anything at this point, couldn't I? We have a problem. - Well, he's back in town. - So what's the problem? All the authentication for the notification systems changed after the seal. We didn't account for them switching the system that fast. - You didn't account for it. - I'm sorry, again. - Meaning what? - Meaning we have no way of notifying the public when it's live anymore, and I have no idea where to start hacking, because none of us have the seal. So I don't even know what technology they used. Caden, that's still not English. We can put it up, but nobody'll know about it - before they take it down again. - So what are our options? Short of him stepping up to the podium on live TV and telling the world he changed his mind about us? We're pretty much up a creek. Caden, after it goes live, how long do we have before they take it down? Maybe three minutes, five tops? So we just get to the podium, would that work? Yeah, 'cause they rent that out on the weekend. No, if he had me. You said yourself, if he had me, he would want to do it on live television. Paul. Yes or no, would it work? Kid. Would he do it live? The world would demand it, but you can't. Would it save lives? This is some kind of penance? That you can risk your life and earn forgiveness? I'm not doing it to be forgiven. I'm not losing another m-- Kid, I'm not losing another member of this team. Maybe you all don't remember, but it's still really fresh for me. I know what it's like to live blinded by hate and think I know love. To kill and destroy and think you're doing the work of a god. Don't they deserve a chance to know the truth? Was this only the plan if it didn't put any of us in any danger? Do we value our lives so much that we're gonna stand here and watch them walk off the cliff? Or do we jump? Do we jump and hope to God we can fall fast enough to get there first and soften the blow. Look, if everyone does their job right, I'll be home for dinner. - Do we still have that watch Reggie used at my house? - Yeah, I've got it. - Can you and Adam add more power to it? - Oh, yeah, like a lot. As soon as I'm done giving my speech, I need to get out of there. - Yeah, I got it. - Caden, have you charged my phone since being back? Yeah, but as soon as you turn it on, they'll swarm. I'm counting on it. I need you to get as far away from here as you can. In the opposite direction. As soon as you have, turn this on. We play our cards right, it'll buy us a few extra minutes before they get here. Everyone should start packing now. Even if this works, they'll find this place. Nobody's safe here anymore. Es, it's gonna be okay. I have to do this. I know. I hope you know what you're doing. I'm proud of you. Jacob would be too. I'll see you soon. Hey. You know I love you, right? No matter what. Thanks for not giving up on me. I'll see you later. Thanks for everything, guys. Please don't let my brother risk his life without telling him the truth. I'm sorry. For everything. Don't be. How close is it to being uploaded? I'm not exactly working with broadband out here. If we can't get this up it was all for nothing. I understand the stakes. Guys. That's not our only problem. You have a visitor. Hello, Paul. It's immensely good to see you. Did you know this was his plan? No. I'm not surprised though. Let's get right to the point. I am nothing if not a god of mercy. I'd like to offer you your old life back, in full. We'll let the past be the past. What will you tell the world? The truth. That you were framed for my death by my administration to create an opportunity to explain my power to the world. And if I refuse? Don't. We have to help him. Esther. We can't leave him. He'll never make it out. There was a time not long ago where I would've done anything for you. Would've given my life without thinking twice. All I wanted was my old life back. That was before I understood who you are. And who am I? Do you know why I chose you, A51? I didn't choose you because your mother was taken. Or because you climbed the ranks of the peace teams. I chose you to be the face of my immortality because you have known nothing but the new world. And that youthful naivety is what I knew would keep you faithful even when the whole world turned its back on you. You chose me because I was broken. Yes. But only to display my power. To show the world how I can fix you. I'm not broken anymore. We'll see about that. Before you make your decision, can I show you something? We'll give you a few minutes. What are you doing here? Figured you'd miss me. I'm not making it out of here alive, Harold. Never was. I know, Paul. Do you remember burying a little wooden box with your mom when you were a boy? I don't have time for this. We can still get you out of here. Paul William Wooden. Answer my question. Yeah. By a big oak tree. A soy bean field behind the house. Do you remember what you buried in the box? No, not everything's come back to me. I need you to remember. I can't. Don't you think I've tried? Paul. Think. The key? To this day, I could never understand why someone would bury the key to a box inside the box. That woman would do the weirdest things. Man, I miss her. You knew my mother? How could you not say anything? I tried to stay close to you, to look after you. I did. I found any way I could to insert myself into your life. I didn't think you were ever gonna remember anything. Until you mentioned that dream. I had this dream. You had giant eagle wings. You were carrying me upside down by your talons. Every time I wore that eagle sweatshirt, you would ask me to pick you up and spin you around upside down, and screech like a bird. Every time I came to your house for a checkup, I thought my heart was going to leap out of my chest. To see you in so much pain, to watch you being filled with so much hate. Just wasn't the boy I remembered. Who are you? I'm the person who's failed you the most, son. But I had to know that you were defiant for yourself first, and not just to have a family again. You don't have to do this anymore. You're... I'm so sorry, Paul. Aren't family reunions beautiful? I was gonna mention the connection between father and son after my assassination, but the public tends to sympathize with family, and that wouldn't really help me any. Have you made your decision yet, A51? Eternity awaits. We have another problem. - We've got company. - Do they know we're back here? I don't know, but if they keep coming, they're gonna know really quick. - What can we do? - Adam, they're jamming my signal. I'm almost done. See, Paul, I would never treat you like that. I would treat you like a prince. Like a son deserves to be treated. If I join you, what's gonna happen to him? Paul. What happens to him? He would be given the option to join us as well. All are welcome. We only want peace. Why do you even want me back? Because getting the rebel who betrayed me to come back, it's the ultimate display of my redemptive power. If you join us, the whole world will see that I have the power to change even the darkest of hearts. He couldn't get Judas to come back, but I can. See, you don't want peace. You want submission. They're the same thing. Only if you choose the right side. News flash, Paul, I win! To me, every knee will bow, every tongue confess. So what's it gonna be, A51? Will you join us? Or does daddy die? The key inside the box, she told me the way in is what needs to be protected. If you don't protect the key, anything can get inside. It's for you first, and then the rest of the world. You did what you had to, Dad. I'm so proud of you, son. You're gonna bring good news. You can do this. I'll see you soon. We need to get this as close to them as possible, and them as far away from us as possible. Is it on? Es, I love you like you're my own. I'm so proud of you. If we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord. If we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord. If we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord. If we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord. Caden, we have to go, now. Guys. I've got it. I figured I'd give you a second to enjoy your defiance. Let you feel like you might just win. For if we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die... Why, Paul? I was so good to you. I offered you everything you ever wanted. I can redirect the domain's IP. Explain quick. Okay, when this first started, we bought server space all over the place not knowing what we'd need. Meaning I can change the IP address to each of the servers as they find them. Whatever site we send them to will always be the same, - but behind the scenes it's constantly changing! - Caden, that's brilliant. It's basic DNS, how did we not think of this before? How much longer will that keep the site up for? Minutes, maybe days. It's completely in his control. This is the last thing we can do. Now, what he wants the world to know, they'll know. Paul. You've done well. I will hold them back. I am for you. - Go. - Caden. There's no use in them getting all of us. Go. At the very least I have to see if this works. Tell everyone you can find how brave I was. My name's Paul Wooden. I'm not the killer they say I am. That really doesn't matter. What matters is that there's nothing to fear. What matters is that there's still hope. The same hope that was written about thousands of years ago exists today. My friends and I have risked our lives to try and give you hope. We've been working for a long time... ...to put the forbidden book online God willing, it's live right now. As long as the site's up, they can't track your download, but it won't be up for long. They'll take it down because they don't want you to have hope. They'll take it down because your leader quotes this book as though it's his own words. My name's Paul William Wooden. And I am defiant. Who are you? They don't have the seal. Who are all these people? What are you doing here? He told us to come here. Who? The man with holes in his hands. He told us you'd be here. You're the ones who released the book. I was told to give you this, when the time was right. I know very few things for sure. I know my name is Esther Wooden. I know the peace this world claims to have is a lie. I know the man with holes in his hands well, the one who came to many of you in dreams, the one their leader pretends to be. The one the forbidden book is written about. If you're standing here, I know you've been through a great deal. You've fought, you've lost much. You've barely scraped by. But your fight can be for something. Can you teach us? How to fight. No more fighting. I can teach you how to surrender. It's how you win the fight. Surrender to the one my brothers died for, the one my father died for, my friends fought and died for. His name is Jesus. And this book, it's called The Bible. It's the true story of the old world, and the new. I'm not gonna lie to you, if you choose to live by it, you will lose a great deal more. Perhaps everything you have will be taken from you. But you'll have everything. I don't know much, but I know that. I know that I have everything. He who didn't spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all thanks? So who are you? You'll have to make that decision at some point. Decide now for yourself, but don't do it for anyone else. It's for you first, then the rest of the world. It has to be in that order. I am defiant. So who are you? I am defiant! What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? We are defiant. We are many. And we win.
