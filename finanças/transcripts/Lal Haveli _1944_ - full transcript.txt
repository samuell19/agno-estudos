You Tube - Video Running Time 01:53:19 You Tube search name - Lal Haveli India. Our India. India, where the valor of Rajputs... love stories of Emperors... and poets' eloquent poems still inspire Indians. Where Agra's Taj Mahal still testifies Mumtaz Mahal... and Emperor Shah Jahan's love. Where Delhi's Kutub Minar still... tells the tales of the bygone Emperors. Where Jhansi fort still stands tall... depicting Queen Laxmibai's heroism. There are many other places where... such tales of love and bravery are left undisclosed. Common people don't know about them. We are talking about the place built by Emperor Humayun... 400 years ago and which he gave to a Rajput soldier. It's called Lal Haveli. He is Emperor Humayun. He made Chittor's Princess his sister... and set an unforgettable example of Hindu-Muslim unity. But the Emperor's story would have remained incomplete... if our ancestors had not laid down their lives... and saved Humayun's life in the Chittor war. This is Jahangir. Once upset with Queen Noor Jahan... he came to this palace. Here is Shah Jahan. He gave his wife's palace a chance to welcome guests... and bestowed honor on us poor people. Here is Emperor Sher Singh. He saved Emperor Humayun's life... and laid the foundation of this palace with his blood. That's why this palace is called Lal Haveli (Red Palace). Mr. Thakur, why are you quiet? You didn't tell us anything about this picture. Thakur, tell them. Mittu. Mr. Thakur, perhaps this picture makes you sad. We don't want to hurt you. If you don't want, then don't tell us anything about this picture. She's a stigma on the splendor of Lal Haveli. When I see her, I have to bow my head. I wish I could erase this chapter from the history of Lal Haveli. She's my elder sister. Mittu! Mukta, handle your parrot. Or else I'll kill it. - Mukta! - Anand! Mukta! Mukta! Let's go to the fair. It's so much fun. They have dancing tigers and bears. Yes. Great sages have come. Someone stands on one foot. Someone stands on his head. They have dancers. Yes. Come, beloved. Let's go to the fair.

You've won the argument You've won You have killer eyes Killer eyes Take me to the fair, beloved I'm tired of telling you I'm tired You have killer eyes Killer eyes Take me to the fair, beloved I'm tired of telling you I'm tired Master, this fair has been going on since your ancestor's time. It's held annually. Is that why you came here from town? In that case, Girdhari, I'm the King of this village? - Why not? - So let go of me. Mukta! Why did you come here without telling anyone? I'm fed up looking for you everywhere. Come. Come home. Mukta. Mukta. Mukta. Hey, blind fellow. Can't you see? You're blocking the road. You don't even answer me. Don't you know I'm the King of this village? King? You're the king? Or am I? Beat him! Beat him! - Well done! Well done! - Beat him! Long live, child. Beat him! Beat him! Keep on beating him! Look, you'll be beaten. You'll be beaten. - Well done! Well done! - Amazing! Don't forget your uncle's tales. Beat him! Beat him! - Beat him! Well done! - Move, move. - Amazing! Amazing! - My master! My master! What master? If you interfere, you'll be beaten. Yes. He's Mr. Laxmi's son from Mumbai. So what? If you come forward, remember. I'm also a priest, belonging to a great family. Yes. Beat him! Where are you going at night? Talk to me for a while. Where are you going at night, uncle? Talk to me for a while. I swear. She is another Lal Kuwar. For sure. Mr. Tiwari, why are you staring at me? I'm telling you, she's another Lal Kuwar. If you get into trouble, don't complain to me. I swear, another Lal Kuwar. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Uncle! Mother, I'm going out to play. I swear, sister-in-law. Another Lal Kuwar. Same features. Same saunter. I swear. Exactly the same. You've gone crazy. Don't you have some work to do? Day and night you only indulge in quarrels. Sister-in-law, since the time brother was killed in the German war... you only lost your husband. But my life was ruined. But he died famous. Yes. Look, does anyone in the village have a gun besides you? He was so brave. His fame spread far and wide. Now forget it. Why did you remind me? - Tell me. Where's Anand? - He went out to play. He's also becoming brave. Of course. A brave man's son will be brave. Will you serve me something? Tell me. - Yes. I'll just get it. - Bring it quickly. Sister-in-law, don't bring it. Don't bring it. I'll return another day. I swear. I'm a celibate. Uncle, you are sweating? You've come. Come. I swear. These nephews have made my life hell. Bhima. Sir. Where did the mangoes go? Sir, there were just a few mangoes. The village boys ate them. The village boys ate them? So why have I hired you? Ordinary village boys can't eat Lal Haveli's fruits. Mr. Thakur, why are you getting angry? It's the effect of Lal Haveli's atmosphere. This palace's greatest offspring was Lal Kuwar. Priest, I've told you so many times... not to use Lal Kuwar's name in my presence. Mr. Thakur... No one can subvert God's will. If it's His will that ordinary people eat Lal Haveli's fruits... then what can you do? And what can this priest, Kanhaiyalal Chaturvedi, do? Why can't I do anything? My ancestors did it for honor. I will do the same thing. Sir... Laxmi Singh has called you. He's called me? Fine. Bhima, get the vehicle. He's lost everything, but not his attitude. He's still proud. He says he'll do everything for honor. In that case, why didn't he stop Lal Kuwar? Uncle, who was Lal Kuwar? Yes, uncle. Who was Lal Kuwar? Yes, uncle. Who was Lal Kuwar? Have patience. Have patience. Tell me, uncle. Who was Lal Kuwar? Tell me too. You, too? Then listen. Adjust your loin cloth. You're so small. And you want to hear Lal Kuwar's story? Get lost! Get lost! - Uncle, tell us! Uncle, tell us! - Get lost! - Uncle, tell us! Uncle, tell us! - Get lost! - Let me capture my breath. I'll tell you. - Tell us. - Oh God! - Tell us. So, listen. Lal Haveli's Thakur, her father... was a proud man. Lal Kuwar was his elder sister. She was so beautiful, so beautiful... that there was no one as beautiful as she... in this village or in the surrounding villages. But she fell madly in love. With whom? With an ordinary man. Soldier Ajit Singh. - And then? - Then, my foot. Ask what happened next. All the boys thrashed him. I left the village and settled down in town. That doesn't mean that poor boys thrash my affluent son. I'll look into the matter, Mr. Laxmi Singh. Thakur, when I safeguard your honor... you also have to safeguard my honor. I can slander your ancestors. But I have safeguarded your palace's prestige, Thakur. I know, Mr. Laxmi Singh. Water. Water. - Jamuna? - Yes. Fetch water. We'll return to town today, son. And then? And then Ajit Singh... eloped with Lal Kuwar. - What happened after that? - What else? Mr. Thakur and his men pounced on Ajit Singh. And a terrible fight broke out right here. There was bloodshed. Finally, Mr. Thakur's men hacked Ajit Singh to death. What did Lal Kuwar do? She picked up Ajit Singh's dagger... thrust it into her chest and died. And made her love story immortal. But that's what Mr. Thakur says. Not priest Kanhaiyalal Chaturvedi. Yes. I even know... what was cooked in Lal Haveli 500 years ago. Understood? I say they didn't die. But they went far away and lived happily as husband and wife. Yes. I am Lal Kuwar! I am Lal Kuwar! Anand, let's play Lal Kuwar's game. Mukta! What commotion is this? Anand and I were playing Lal Kuwar's game, father. Lal Kuwar, you silly girl! Who told you to play Lal Kuwar's game? Beware if you play it again. I'll thrash you badly. Come here. Anand, listen to me carefully. If you come to Lal Haveli again, I'll break your legs. - Understood? - I understand. You fool! You argue with me? Forgive him. Mother, Thakur hit you. Thakur, you raised your hand on a woman. Are you a Rajput? - I'll kill Thakur. - No, son. - I'll kill him. - No. - Mother, leave me. - No, son. - Let me go. Where's Thakur? Anand. Anand. Mukta, don't get in my way. Leave him. For my sake. Mukta! Mukta! Mukta, move. - Thakur! - Anand! Scoundrel! How dare you hit a Thakur! I... Thakur, is this the prestige of Lal Haveli's brave Rajputs? You hit women and children. Priest, I don't want to see this rogue's face. Anand, leave. Go! You also leave. Go! Thakur. Go and bring him. Go! Sing, bird The bird sings songs Go and bring him Sing, bird This youth won't last for long Don't regret later Sing, bird The path of love is new I am a traveler and the path is arduous Show us the way Sing, bird Mukta, look. This looks so beautiful. Poor one! Why? Because it must also be in love with someone. Must be. Anand, listen to me. Today come with me to the palace. Mukta, don't force me. I don't know anything. You'll have to come. Come. Come on. I am helpless. I can't enter the palace, Mukta. Anand, what are you saying? My honor and pride prevent me. - I can't come inside. - Anand. Anand. Fine. Don't come. But remember... I have respect too. Now you'll never see my face again. Uncle, tell me the truth. How do I look? - I've bought these clothes from town. - Amazing! Wonderful! Even your ancestors used to wear such clothes. Stay within your limits. You drank again. I swear. I'll break your other leg too. I've told you so many times not to drink. But you don't listen. Uncle, she's come. - Where? Where, son? - There. Langu, now leave. See you later. Go. I swear. I'm a celibate. Uncle, you're sweating? Yes, son. Son, you're a true man. You don't miss a chance. Uncle, when I see you and Anand... I can't stop laughing. God, Your play is divine. You've made women so lovely! Well done. Make your ancestors proud. Uncle, I told Anand... Look, he's come. Uncle, since yesterday Mukta's been upset with him. So he's wandering on the streets. Uncle, should I enter the palace like a shameless man? Listen, you're a brave man. But I swear. You don't have any brains. Did you hear, uncle? What will he hear? I'll tell you. - Thakur told you not to set foot in Lal Haveli. Right? - Go on. Look there. Are you worse than the donkeys? Right, uncle? - You're talking sense. - Yes. Great. Come with me. Look, jump across the wall, without setting foot inside. But, Manglu... I swear. In love and war you have to use your brains. Come on. You're very heavy. - But, Manglu... - Yes. She's here. Amazing! Now begin. Since last evening I've been perturbed I wander in the streets of damsels Since last evening I've been perturbed Seeing the agony of my heart... she will come to me Since last evening I've been perturbed The moon has descended to earth Poor people will celebrate today Since last evening I've been perturbed I don't care whether anyone asks me or not I am safeguarding my beloved Since last evening I've been perturbed I wander in the streets of damsels Mittu, tell him I have nothing to give. So go ahead. Manglu, tell her I'm a Rajput fakir. I won't leave empty handed. Mittu, tell him Rajputs don't beg. Manglu, tell her I haven't come to beg. I've come to find my lost heart. Mittu, tell him not to talk to me. I don't know him. Mukta, you've forgotten me. But your eyes and your heart know me well. Eyes can be deceived too. And my heart is broken. Don't say that, Mukta. Don't be stubborn. Anand, you always think about your own happiness. My happiness means nothing to you? You will be happy. But Mukta, don't insist on calling me inside the palace. I promise you... you'll come to my house very soon forever. Say you're not angry with me. Say it. - Is that so? Now I can't wait. - My Mukta! Okay, Mukta. Now you... Great! You're so engrossed. You're going far ahead. Manglu, now you leave. Go. I showed you the way. And you're going far ahead. Manglu, she'll again get upset. If she gets upset, I'll give you another idea. Please leave. Fine. Give me 25 paisa. - 25 paisa? - Yes. Take this. Now leave. Go. Manglu. The night is dark, beloved. Don't go. - Manglu! - What? You always stop me. - Do you have some money? - Why? First tell me if you have any. - I have 25 paisa. - My work will be done. I have a penny. I'll buy a drink with it. Get lost! I asked for 25 paisa and got it. And I should buy a drink for you? Get lost! Go away! Look, I'll spend the evening somehow. But I'll hold a grudge against you. Listen, Langru. Where are you going? Shame on your life. Come, I'll buy drinks for you. You'll always remember this wealthy man. Manglu, you'e so generous. I've been telling you for the past 20 years. Don't drink. It's bad for you. But nobody listens to me. See their plight. They get some money and come here to drink. Uncle, you also come here to drink. You point fingers at me. I come here to drink? Come on! Leave! Get lost! Go! Bhola, give me a drink. Bhola, do I reek? Priest, has your breath ever reeked? Langru. Uncle, did you call me? You've come here again? Day before yesterday I forbade you. Come on! Leave! Uncle, I swear. We weren't coming here. The doctor said to sprinkle warm liquor on his leg. He'll be absolutely fine. That's why we came. Great! You're duping me. Manglu, I used to adjust your loin cloth when you were a kid. You know? Uncle, turn your face. You reek. My breath reeks? You mean I'm drunk? I'll break your face. Yes. If you misbehave with me. lnsolent boy. Priest, pay me my money. I swear. You guys have a very bad habit. Very bad habit. Do I have a treasure? It's just a few pennies. Credit goes on between acquaintances. Take this. Give me change if you have it. But don't interfere. You guys have a very bad habit. - Uncle. - Yes. There she goes. Okay. Today you can drink, Langru. But don't drink again. Okay? Go! Don't drink again. Yes. I swear. I'm a celibate. Uncle, you're sweating. Yes, son. I'm sweating. Priest Girdharilal, listen. Listen. - Hello, priest. - Hello. Hello. - Priest. - Yes. You call yourself a priest. Why? You smear sandalwood on your forehead. You wear the sacred necklace. And you became a priest. You conducted a few marriages. And you chanted a few mantras. And you call yourself a priest. Great! Priest Kanhaiyalal Chaturvedi is a true priest. I give sermons to the world. Got it? I attend venerations. I give sermons in beer bars. I talk to dancers. - But my heart... - Priest. - is clean. Listen to me. Did you understand? Yes. A true scholar is the one who experiences everything... but doesn't go astray. Yes. Priest, you reek of liquor. If you don't experience foul smells, how can you sniff sweet ones? That's why I say you don't have a clean heart. Understood? Go. Go your way. Do your work. Reeking. Mukta, a horse is happy only in its stable. Look, it's so much fun here. I feel delighted when I come here. Mukta. Mukta. Enchantress, show me your beautiful face Show me your beautiful face Enchantress, show me your beautiful face Don't play the flute and dance Enchantress, show me your beautiful face How will I console my heart? You are near and yet I am craving My beauty is priceless Show me your beautiful face Enchantress, show me your beautiful face My plight is the same as yours We are sailing in the same boat Let's romance Enchantress, show me your beautiful face Here, see my face. - Did you see? - Nope. I see. Are you going blind? Here, see. Did you see? So, even I say no. Mukta. Mukta. Do you remember the days when we used to come here everyday? But you must remember the day... we stole mangoes from Pandey's garden. Okay. You must surely remember the day... you married Manglu. And he sped off with you on a donkey. You cried inconsolably. That day I was so scared. I was so nervous. Were you really scared? Mukta, Manglu... I was really scared. Maya. Yes, father. - Did you write the letter? - To whom? You don't remember? To Lal Haveli's Thakur. Who else? Only 10 days are left for the marriage. And you're not concerned? Father, is it my marriage or sister's marriage? I'm getting married... but how can I write the letter, father? Why doesn't brother write the letter? Jawahar. - Yes, father. - Where are you going? - I was going on a picnic. - Come here. Going on a picnic. Do go. Tomorrow is 'Bhaidooj' (Festival). You'll have to give your sisters a gift. Not true, Maya. Nothing doing. Go and write a letter to Lal Haveli's Thakur. If you want to go somewhere, wait two days. Got it? Don't turn away after stealing my heart It's heartless The world is heartless Don't turn away after stealing my heart Oh sweetheart Yes, beloved I feel restless without you I will fulfill my promise You fulfill your promise Don't turn away after stealing my heart Your soul dwells in my body My soul in yours You thought it's your shadow When in fact it's my shadow You're the flame and I'm the moth Don't turn away after stealing my heart Oh Goddess! Your words are potent! - You are fair, but your heart is black. - Anand. Quiet. The Goddess doesn't speak. I'm praying to Her to make Mukta mine. I don't want to be the soldier who enticed Lal Kuwar. But if I get the chance, I won't back off. I'll elope with you. Why are you laughing? Fine. I won't laugh. But I'll think about it. You'll think about it. You do that. Why don't I strangle you before that? Anand, leave me. Leave me. Look, my eyes are watering up. - I won't leave you. First say yes. - Yes. I'm yours. I'm yours. Leave me. - Okay. Shall you give you an idea? - Yes. Go to uncle priest and tell him to talk to father about our marriage. Honestly, father will agree. Wow! What an idea! I'll convince uncle. Did you see? Goddess gave you a superb idea. Only after I strangled you. Uncle, a friend in need is a friend indeed. It's a trivial matter. I don't want to tell you. You had fever the other day. Can anyone run and fetch medicine? Manglu and I are the only ones. If we won't help uncle, will strangers help him? I swear. It happened yesterday. I didn't even tell uncle. - Why discuss trivialities? - What's the matter, son? - Nothing, uncle. Hathilal Patwari's son Kalwa. - Yes. He was taking your horse to slaughter it. I saw him. I gave him a tight slap and he fell down. I said, "How dare you take uncle's horse to slaughter?" He replied, "The horse ate the food grains." I said, "No problem." As long as I'm there, uncle's horse will eat... food grains of the entire village. And nobody can say anything. It's been three months since my horse died. How can it die, uncle? It died? It died? Uncle, the horse died. I'll go and wear my coat. But coat... Uncle, I don't have anyone. After father's death, you're everything for me. If you want, you can conduct your nephew's marriage. - Otherwise, uncle... - Yes, son. Why not? - Do you like any girl? - Uncle, why do you ask that? You know, uncle. I've known for 15 years. But son, they are affluent people. No problem. My name is also Kanhaiyalal Chaturvedi. - Great, uncle! Great! - Son, massage here. Priest, think before you speak. Mukta and Anand can't get married. Thakur, remember. If the marriage doesn't take place... she'll be another Lal Kuwar. Priest! Leave my sight! As long as I'm alive, this will never happen. Never! Mukta! Mukta! Mukta! - Father. - Mukta, so what if I'm unwell? But you'll never succeed in your ploy. You are Thakur's daughter. This Thakur has faced every hardship. But didn't give people a chance to point fingers at us. Laxman Singh's daughter is going to get married. Go and make arrangements to go to the city. But father, I won't go to the city. You won't go? You'll have to go. Do you want to slander Lal Haveli's honor? And our ancestor's memento that makes us proud... you want somebody else to own it? But father, I don't like city people. I hate them. You hate them? Because they helped us keep the honor of this palace intact. Do you know? Since your grandfather's time this palace... has been mortgaged to them. They never say anything. And you refuse to attend their marriage? Go! Make arrangements to leave. Porter, put my luggage inside the train. - I'll buy the ticket. - Sir, you won't have time. The train is leaving. - You're a porter, right? - Yes, sir. So, take the luggage. Keep the luggage. I'm coming. Why do you push me? How did you enter in this carriage? Can't you see it's for ladies? - Hello. - This is the ladies' compartment. Forgive me. I'm hard of hearing. I said this is ladies' compartment. You've recently got married. Your good name? My good name? My good name is, go to hell. Ms. Satyawati. Pleased to meet you. Yes. I'm also pleased. But what to do? Now I understand. You act in movies. You're a good actor. I've heard you even earn good money. Foolish guy. But why are you sitting so uncomfortably? Rest. Rest. Pleased to meet you. By the way, thanks for abusing me. But you're deaf. I'm sorry to hear Mr. Thakur isn't well. You didn't face any problem during the journey, did you? Mona! Look who's come. The village Thakur's daughter has come. Mukta, how are you? Maya, she's so grownup. Yes, sister. Brother! Brother! Look who's come. Greet her. She's the village Thakur's daughter, Mukta. She's grown up to be so beautiful. Just like a rose. Yes, but there are many thorns in this flower. It pierces from a distance. If someone touches her by mistake... he won't be spared. I swear. I'm a celibate. Manglu, you're sweating. You even eye your uncle's woman. Uncle, I swear to you. I was recommending you. Whether you believe me or not. Bless you. Very good. Uncle, you don't trust me? No. You're my most honest nephew. I swear, uncle. You can search the whole world. - But you won't find a nephew like me. - Bless you. - You get angry for no reason. - No, son. - She's coming. - Coming. Now you leave. Go. Go. - Manglu. - Yes. Why are you staring at me? I'm seeing that in olden times... people suffered from coughs and fevers. But now this ailment of love is so rampant... neither a doctor nor a physician can cure it. Manglu, again you talk nonsense. You silly fellow. I'm waiting for uncle. Is that so? Very good. Very good. Only you and uncle will free India. He's busy with his woman and you with yours. - Manglu? - Yes. The entire world is prospering. But you don't gain any sense. - And it's not sold anywhere that I can buy it for you. - True. - Manglu. - Yes. You think I'm waiting for Mukta? No. You're waiting for me. Right? - You fool. - Yes. I've come to ask uncle what you should do... if you miss someone immensely? Buddy, whether you feel indebted to me or not. But I swear. Only I will give you advice. Hear the lover narrate the tale of women. - Manglu. - Yes. - Now go home. Go. Go carefree. Go! Go! It's true. Lovers and owls love the forest. Silly fellow. You fool! You don't know what love is. Again, I'm missing you, beloved I feel anxious, beloved Again, I'm missing you, beloved Beloved, I tell you I tell my beloved stories all the time I have given my heart and bought this priceless memento So why do you torment me, beloved? Again, I'm missing you, beloved Both are waves of the river We clash against each other A gust of wind blows... and unites the both of us I will get my beloved Again, I'm missing you, beloved I feel anxious, beloved Again, I'm missing you, beloved The night is dark. Don't go, beloved. - The night is dark... - Manglu! What's this? You're going for work? I swear. It will surely rain today. I was going. I won't go now. You've hurt my feelings. You're very bad. Manglu, Mukta is coming. She has sent me a letter. - Read this. - I should read? I'm illiterate. Had I been literate, would I have gone for farming? You tell me. What's she written? She's written, I've been delayed. I'm returning soon. Forgive me. You're a fool. Tell me. What did you learn? I'm a fool. I swear. You should never trust a woman. They betray you. Listen, once my aunt went to the city. Understand? When she returned, she asked me... Where is Manglu? Tell me. What should I have told her? But she is my Mukta. Listen, if Mukta has not changed, then drink liquor... and spit on my face thrice. Manglu. - Do you know where you have to go? - To the fields. So go there slowly and quietly. - I see. - Go. - I see. I wrote so many letters. But you're so busy with Manglu. May I come in? Yes. Why not? You haven't finished writing letters? How many letters will you write? People are waiting on you to go to the club. Mr. Jawahar, it's better if you excuse me. That's not possible. You'll have to come. You have your whole life to write love letters. Maya, where are you going? Nowhere, brother. I'll be right there. Look, get her ready quickly. Or else we'll be late. In a jiffy. Come. Tell me, Nana. What's going on? Come. See, I took this handkerchief... from Ms. Chandni. And it's a special memento of her love. I'll tear it up. What have you done, Mr. Nana? I'll tear it to pieces. Mr. Thakur, please. Give me the handkerchief. - Give me. - I don't have the handkerchief. Here, here it is. How was it? - Enough. It's enough. Just leave it. It's fine. - Just a little more. Now it's perfect. Honestly, sister, I don't like all this. I just like sarees. Or this monkey's face... What do you know of the city? You're an illiterate. Now, put on these shoes. - No, no. I hate these horse-like heels. - Come. Ever since Mukta has arrived here... Mr. Jawahar's been in high spirits. Please come. He's the doctor. We stayed together. And she is Ms. Sarojini. - And he... - Please don't bother. I'll introduce myself. Madam, I am Nainaji. I'm the dust on everyone's feet... but I see the world with just one eye. Pleased to meet you. Did you like the dance? I didn't. But I did feel sorry for the villagers. Sorry? Why sorry? Actually, the innocent villagers are considered to be... idiots by the people from the cities. You glorify us townies. - Or what are you? - Shut up, Nainaji. Shut up, doctor. Why not? You'll like everything about the village. - Because of your beloved and those letters. - Brother... Brother, let's go to the village. It's been so many years we've been there. Yes sure. And be our guests. So nice of you. If you invite, I'll come back from the grave. - Nainaji. - Doctor. Damn it. See, these are 2 annas. Got it. See Langdu, you've lost. You got anything else? Get lost. Brother Manglu, will you lend me 1-2 annas? See Langdu, I've told you a thousand times not to... gamble with borrowed money. But you don't understand. I swear on God, I'll hit you so hard with the stick that... your head will burst. See that, brother Jaggu? It's these people that defame gambling. You tell me, is there anything more reasonable than gambling? - No, not at all. - Yes. But, it should be played sincerely. - Bid cash and give cash and get back cash. - Really? - Manglu. - Yes. Gambling again? Manglu, its only me who'll kill you. Brother, brother. I swear on God, can I gamble? Oh God! This Langdu, always keeps asking to gamble. Do good men gamble? Get out of here. Here are your 12 annas. Let's go, brother. Let me see. Manglu, hurry up. You know Mukta is coming? Mukta. - Mukta? - Yes. Do you know who Mukta is? She's a woman. Woman. Come, please come. After all, it's your own village, your own house. Manglu. Ms. Mukta, the station is here, so is the station master and... also the coolie. But, where is your Mr. Beloved? Yes Mukta, didn't he come? Forget it, sister. If he doesn't come, then so be it. Manglu, you were right. Mukta seems so different. - Let's go back. - Brother, let's at least talk. I'm telling you to leave. Let's go. Mr. Jawahar, will we go to your bungalow or will... your bungalow come here to receive us? No. You'll all come to the mansion. You, please don't bother. Your mansion or... my bungalow is the same thing. And, eventually we are your guests, after all. Please come. Yes, let's go. Don't get trapped in the web of damsels Don't fall in love, my dear. Don't fall in love Don't make eye contact with these beautiful-eyed Don't fall in love, my dear. Don't fall in love No guarantees of the promises. The darlings are liars They speak innocently but their hearts aren't Nature has taught them to steal hearts Don't fall in love, my dear. Don't fall in love When they stroll wearing their plaits in the market... the hair is a disguise. They have nurtured two snakes They'll bite you, friends. Don't get too close Don't fall in love, my dear. Don't fall in love Don't get trapped in the web of damsels Don't fall in love, my dear. Don't fall in love Mr. Jawahar, very nice. The bungalow is very nice. Who builds such a bungalow in the village? - It's only your big heartedness. What say? - Yes true. - But, the one we're here for isn't to be seen. - Who? I know what your heart beats for. Ms. Mukta. Shut up. - Anand, Mukta is yours and will always remain. - No. The lipstick on your lips, the powder on your cheeks... your shoes, your saree are all saying... - that you are no longer mine. - Anand! How do I make you understand? There's a mystery about the mansion's honor in all this. - Anand, I can't upset them. - But, you can hurt me? - Go away. - Anand, don't say that. Forgive me. Please think of my reputation. Please come along for awhile. They're waiting for you. I won't go there. Anand, you want to disgrace me over a petty issue? You can't force me? Of course I can. Aren't you mine? Aren't you? You'll surely come, won't you? Won't you? Swear that you'll come. No, I don't want to learn dancing. I don't like it. Maya, why force her? She doesn't want to. Forget it. Mr. Jawahar, just excuse me for 10 minutes. I'll be back. See, that's not possible. You don't want to dance, it's fine... but you'll surely have to sit here. Mukta. Oh, this is your beloved? Come, come, welcome. Sit, help yourself. You must drink local liquour here... but today I'm offering you imported liquour. Nanaji. Please sit. Mukta, this place is not for us. Are you coming or not? Anand! - Drink. Drink a lot. - Anand what are you up to? - Everybody drink. - What's happened to you today, Anand? - Manglu, I'm very happy today. - What happened? Drink a lot. Today is the biggest day of my life. Today even Anand will drink. Anand! What have you done? You're drunk. Yes, I'm drunk. What happened? Anand, are you drunk? Father, you were brave. I'm no coward, either. I've scored a point over you. You never drunk liquor. But, I have. Son, leave this gun. Leave it, Anand. Leave it, Mother. I won't give this to anyone, mother. Son, where are you going? Leave me, mother. Anand. Anand, open the door. Anand. Anand. Anand. Love letters. Anand. The color of the crops will be turning yellow. Right now, I am wearing a crop colored cloak... but without you, this seems yellow to me. I've thrown it away. Now, I'll come to you and I'll make you do it with your hands. Sure, I'll do it. Sure, I'll do it. Sure, I'll do it. Mukta, your silence is troubling us. Yes, everything seems silent. - At least smile once. - Wow! - If she smiles, then our world will change. - Lalaji! Mukta, don't get upset with Lalaji's opinions. He just... My Anand shot a bullet? Anand shot Jawahar? - Anand shot a bullet? - Doctor... ls his life in danger? Will my brother survive? Will he survive? Why aren't you saying anything? Tell me. Tell me, that he'll survive. Brother, brother. Doctor, save him somehow. - There's only one way he can survive. - What? If somebody gives him blood, then... - because he's lost a lot of blood. - Then doctor, save his life. Give him blood and save him. Lalaji, you people are Mr. Jawahar's best friends. Can you give him blood? Why have you lowered your heads? Doctor, I'm ready to give my blood. But, that'll jeopardize your life. No problem, doctor. I'm ready to give my blood, but save his life. Thakur, Thakur, Mukta is donating her blood. Mukta is giving her blood. What are you saying, Pandit? Speak clearly. To save Jawahar's life, Mukta is giving her own blood. Are you aware, Thakur, she's putting her own life at risk? - She'll die. - That cannot happen. That can never happen. I'll never let her give her blood. Never. Where is my daughter? Mukta. Who is taking her blood? You leave me. Where is my daughter? Who has taken away her blood? Anand. Anand. Brother Anand. I've gone crazy looking for you. What have you done? Anyway, whatever you've done was for the good. But you should have given Manglu a chance. I would have showed some action. Manglu, I've nobody apart from you. What are you saying, brother? I can give my life for you. Catch this wretched guy. - Who are you? - We are here on behalf of Mr. Jawahar to capture him. - Really? - Yes. Brother, they've come to capture you. Should I count to three? You please come over here. Come. This shouldn't be resolved with violence. You've come to capture me? Slowly. Had I known of your hospitality... I never would have come. Lift your head up, lift it. Friend, you are one big coward. I don't feel like raising a weapon against you. Get up. Oh, you're wearing a tie? - Then you should be taken care of well. - Let me go, sir. - Let you go? - Let me go. - Okay, go. Where are you going? Come here, come here. Let me go. For God's sake let me go. Want to go? Okay son, go. But, if I see you here again, then nobody can save you. Get lost! Are you looking back? Lalaji? What's your condition? Today, I saw such action, such action. Don't say anything. All villagers on one side and I was all alone. - But they realized my strength. What say? - Yes, true. - No doubt you're injured so badly. - The wounds will heal... but thankfully his second eye is fine. Or... What is an eye for Mr. Jawahar? The only sad part is that the fellow got scared and ran off. And I never chase any person running away. But how do you know he was the one who shot the bullet? Is there any evidence? Evidence? Here is the evidence, this bullet. His bullet, his gun. And he's the one who shot it. Well said, doctor. I enjoyed it. But, Mr. Jawahar, one should be born as lucky as you... or there's no point in being born. Why? It's a little masculine talk. Ladies, excuse me. Mr. Jawahar, you are so lucky! Can you please tell me what's the matter? - When you were shot, Mukta yelled in anguish. - So? Then the doctor said your life was in danger... - and you wouldn't survive without receiving blood. - Then? She instantly agreed to give her blood. Giving blood is not an easy thing. She's a kid from the village. She didn't realize she was giving her blood. She suits you perfectly. You make a good couple. Why don't you propose marriage, Mr. Jawahar? I surely will. Actually, dad will do it. Thakur, as you are aware, I've never asked you for my money... and I've kept this mansion's honor a secret. I very well understand, Ratansingji... but Mukta's ailment has me worried. If you wish this secret to remain a secret for the upcoming generations... - then there is only one solution. - What is that the solution? Mukta and Jawahar's marriage. - Mukta, did you hear that? - Yes, I did. - But this will never happen. - You want to live your whole life like this? What else can one ask for? You're getting a boy from such a good family. - He has, name, money... - Father, you don't understand. I understand everything. But do you want to take the blame for Lal Mansions's ruin? That mansion whose foundation was... laid down with your ancestor's blood. For whose honor our family members laid down their lives. - Daughter, this is a question of the mansion's honor. - But... Daughter, now its honor is in your hands. Either save it or destroy it. Okay, father, if Mukta's ruin can keep her... ancestor's glory alive, then I'll go ahead with this wedding. My sweet daughter! Uncle, I'm telling the truth, Anand can't tolerate this shock. Manglu... I've raised him like my own child. But look into my eyes. My soul is weeping. I've raised him like my own child. Uncle, you know... apart from you, he won't listen to anybody in this village. You please make him understand or he'll kill himself. - Or he'll kill someone else. - Manglu... don't let that happen, son. Or this village will be finished. Manglu, he is the only one after his father who is a lion heart. Manglu, aren't you his friend? Friend, friend. Uncle... I am the son of a father who gave away his life for friendship. Uncle... if Anand needs Manglu... do you think Manglu will back off, uncle? Then go, son, please go. Make him understand. Go. What does this heart search for? The one who is to sink, has already sunk The one who is to sink, has already sunk Of what help will be a small wooden log? Why does this heart search for love by the river's shore? Betrayed by its own people, all became enemies I belonged to the world No one belonged to me Why does this heart search for love by the river's shore? The one who is to sink, has already sunk Of what help will be a small wooden log? Anand. Anand, I am helpless. This is what I expected from you... and I was alive to see this day... to see my own house on fire right before my eyes. Anand. My heart is burning for your love's desire... and it'll keep burning till I die. Not love, sweetheart. lnstead, say cheating and backstabbing. Remember those days, when you used to stand under this tree... and say, Anand, you are my life's dream. My world will be shattered without you, I'll be finished. Anand, for God sake, please have mercy on me. Please don't remind me of Lal Kunwar's stories. Lal Kanwar's name does not suit your tongue. She was the Goddess of love. But the Lal Mansion is begging me for love. Even my love begs you. Anand... if it makes you happy... then hit me, hit me more. - Anand, what are you doing? - Leave me, Manglu. This hand deserves to be chopped off. Today this hand was raised on a woman. So you'll chop your hand for that? Anand, you're the son of a father... who took six bullets right in his chest and... didn't sacrifice his life for women. No, Manglu, now I won't live in this village anymore. Where will you go? - There, where my father gave up his life. - I'll accompany you. Uncle, nobody can understand God's wishes. If Anand was getting married today, then it would have been... so much fun. We would have been so happy. Yes, son. It's all destiny. - Uncle, won't you go for the wedding? - Why not, son? I'll have to go. How will the marriage take place without... Pandit Kanhaiyalal Chaturvedis's presence? This wedding cannot happen. Thakur, this wedding cannot happen. Pandit, have you crazy? Thakur, you haven't yet got rid of Lal Kanwar's ink marks... on your forehead. Now do you want your entire face to be painted with ink? - Pandit, what are you saying? - I'm saying it right. This wedding can't take place... because they're siblings. Siblings? Siblings? They can't be siblings. That guy is a rascal. Throw him out. Pandit, how can they be siblings? They can't be siblings. Why not? Didn't Mukta give her blood to save Jawahar's life? Isn't Mukta's blood running in Jawahar? Hasn't her parent's blood mixed in Jawahar's blood? Children can be verbally different but this... is a question of blood relationships, Thakur. And these priests, they've drawn three lines on their heads... and have come here to marry them. Get on with the wedding. Get the siblings married. Now, I won't let this wedding take place. Mukta. Mukta, this is disrespectful to me and my family. Mr. Jawahar, I'm helpless. Mukta, this is childish. Such things happen every day in the city. But this is not a city. It's a village. Then the consequences will be even worse. I'll tarnish the image of the Lal Haveli. Mukta cannot marry her brother for the honor of the mansion. Then listen to me. Now, in place of the mansion... there will be a stable for cows and horses. As a reminder of your inherited pride, of which you are so proud... there will be nothing but ruins. Mukta... the fire of my vengeance will... turn this mansion into ashes. I'm sorry. Brother, what did this madam say? Come on, stupid. What good will knowing it do? Hey, watch where you're going. She laughed. Brother, she laughed again. Brother, if she laughs again, then it means she's trapped. - See. - See what? Didn't you see? She's trapped and very well trapped. You wouldn't understand that. Swear on God, Mutka is married. She'll be about to deliver a boy now. But, you're always dreaming about her. Come. Come along with me. That's true. But, brother, I swear on my youth... I can't believe whether she laughed looking at me or at you. Your things be yours. Very good, Brother. Swear on God, one should have such intentions. But brother... See, she's come. Everybody fall in a line. Now, remove your clothes. Remove clothes? In front of a woman? He's asking you to remove your shirt. Yes, really? - Madam, just check here. - What happened to your heart? God knows. Ever since it saw you... it's been misbehaving. - You'll be alright. - Madam, will you give me medicine? Why not? Surely. Nurse. Yes, sir. - Admit these two to the hospital. - Alright, sir. Brother, hey, brother... She's short in stature, but... I swear on God she's spicier than a chilli. What are you looking at? Put on your clothes. Get ready. I won't go. If I die then... poor madam will remain a spinster all her life. I won't go. I'm going to the hospital. Manglu, you'll have to come. Get up, come. I'll not go at all. Even I'm a Rajput. My words are final. I won't go. Take it. Kill me, kill me. What are you waiting for? - You're Rajput, too.. - Manglu, that won't happen. Anand, you'll regret it. Kill me, I swear on Mukta. Kill me with this knife. Well done, Anand brother. Very good. This one thing happened in life. Mr. Manglu, why did you injure your hand for me? Madam, I am a Rajput. That is how we love. Forget the hand. I would behead myself for you and lay it at your feet. - But there is one regret, you won't ask me to. - No... - I don't want your head. - Just ask for it once. Say, say. Tell me, why do you love me? - Should I tell you the truth, madam? - Yes. - You are very fair. - And you are so dark. Madam, you didn't understand. Lord Krishna was very dark... and Radha was very fair. But, their love was... Didn't get it? Madam, you can't understand... as this is Indian mythology. I understood. Tell me the name of your village. My village? My village is very different. Hot air in summer, cold air in winter. It is so much fun. And during the monsoon the girls play on swings below the tree. Keep the palanquin below the mango tree, hey passerby! It's monsoon time, it's monsoon time. - You are such a jolly man. I like you a lot. - Madam! Doctor sir, will Anand survive? Doctor sir, will he survive? Mother, I want your blessing for my lifelong prayers. Tell me I won't become a widow. Please say, mother. Mukta. Mukta. My fate has never changed... for the better My fate... I can't see any fate even for a moment My fate After I die, this fate will rise My fate My fate has never changed for the better My fate The mad wind comes and annoys me Reminds me like lightning strikes My heart is broken, my property looted My property My fate has never changed for the better My fate I feel like setting the globe on fire... and burning the whole world Burn the whole world There is no patience left in me Patience left in me My fate has never changed for the better My fate Until you satisfy my heart, I won't let you in peace. I keep getting anxious while you live a peaceful life. That can't be tolerated. After all, even I have a heart. Mukta, you are my life's goal. Now, come and enter my heart. Mukta. Mukta. Who is Mukta? Doctor, this is all about love. You know, love, love, love. - He was to get married to a girl in our village. - Marriage? Yes marriage. And due to some situations... his wedding with her couldn't happen. - I understood. - Doctor sir, understands. Why are you packing, brother? I'm going to the village. I won't let you go alone. If you want to go, then take me, too. - No, Maya, I'll go myself. - No. The sibling festival is coming... and brother wants to leave the sister alone. It's festival time again? Yes, brother. Take me along. - Please. - Okay. Hello, how are you? How are you? How are you? Hello, Anand. We congratulate you. You fought very well. You've been promoted to Lieutenant. Doctor, I swear on God, swear on God... even I would have fought the same. But, doctor, at the end time my hand betrayed me. Oh yes! Sure, sure. Mr. Anand, you're very weak at the moment. You've been granted leave to rest. You can go home. And you'll be happy to know that we've won this war. The enemy has fled. The enemy has run away, doctor? They won't return? But, doctor, I don't want to go home. I don't want to go home. Doctor, he's lost his mind. If your limbs aren't healthy... then will you shoot with your head? What say, Madam? Doctor, then I'll have to take leave for him. He's so very weak, he can't walk at all. Yes, sure, sure! Listen, wherever you go I'll accompany you. I'll take leave, too. Oh yes! Sure, sure, sure. Why have you dressed me up like an ape? See Madam, you should dress like the place you are in. Both the lovers should feel the heat. And, madam, over there... during childhood we used to play cowries. - Cowries? - You know, gambling. - You mean gambling! - Yes, sure, sure, my dear. Aunt, hey aunt! Who is it? Manglu! Anand! Brother Anand. - Brother, aunt passed away. - Mother. Brother Anand, control yourself, control yourself. While she was dying she said, Look, Langdu... whenever my Anand comes, don't tell him I'm dead. Tell him I've gone on pilgrimage. Yes, we've heard that. Will you shut up now. Come on! Come on! Look darling, take care of Anand when I leave. And shut the door. - Alright. - Light? You'll not get light here. There's the kerosene lamp. Come on! - Boss, Anand has returned. - He's back? He's wearing a uniform. Anand is back. - Uncle, you're sweating. - Yes, I know, son. - Manglu, you're back? - Yes, uncle. When did you come, son? Hello, uncle, how are you? Swear on God, uncle. Tell me the truth. - Aren't I looking handsome? - What to say, son? Today all the village donkeys will sing in rhythm. - But, where is Anand? - Anand, he's become a Lieutenant. Become a Lieutenant? But, where is he? Uncle, they also offered me the promotion... but I said get out, out. I won't accept anything below General. The commander told me, kill more 2-4 Germans... and I'll make you General. I said forget 2-4 Germans. I can blow away 10-20 of them. - But, let me return from my holidays. - Very good, son. - Uncle, I've got a fair. - Fair? - Yes, a fair Madam for you. - Well done, sir. - But has Anand come or not? - Sure, sure. - Son, tell me has Anand come? - He has come. He's come? - Who is it? - It's me, Mukta. - Open the door. Truly, it's become very late. Come, come in. I... just wanted to see him. See, look at me properly. Now I'm worth seeing. Because I not the innocent villager Anand any more. See this. I wear a jacket and trousers. Did you see that? - Anand. - Not Anand, call me Lieutenant Anand... because I don't drink local liquor. Now I drink imported. Anand, I won't let you do this. Leave it, Anand. It's really much too late. Now what's the point in coming back to me? The villagers will defame us. Go, go away. I wear a jacket and trousers. Mukta, I don't drink local liquor now. I now drink imported. Anand, I won't let you do this. You did a very wrong thing. This is like hanging yourself. You insulted her. She who waited so long for you and... who prayed for your safe return by lighting... thousands of lamps to the goddess. Who is still awaiting you dressed up as a bride. Uncle, then didn't she get married? She's still waiting for you and hasn't married anybody else. Mukta. Mukta. What are you doing, Mukta? I'm setting on fire... that place of love where false love was conceived... - where false hopes were born. - Have you gone mad? I was. Now, I've come to my senses. - What do you want from me? - Nothing. I've just come to ask for forgiveness. So, you've come to rub salt in my wounds? Mukta, I was under the impression you were married. Hope, I was married. And even you would have suffered like me. I'm already suffering, Mukta, Why? The new bride's love couldn't quench your thirst? Who are you talking about, Mukta? Even that, Mukta has to explain? City women are better than the village women... because they can stop you from drinking. You're talking about Manglu's wife. She's your sister-in-law. - Sister-in-law? - Yes. So, you aren't really married? I am already married just below this tree. Forgot that? - Mr. Jawahar? - Yes, well recognized. The same Jawahar. Mukta, that day it was your turn... and today it's my turn. That day my dignity was at stake... and today the mansion's dignity is in my hands. And you? Good, I met you, too. I'll take my revenge today. Mr. Jawahar, he didn't shoot at you. You don't have any evidence against him. Evidence? I've got the evidence. Look at this bullet. That isn't proof. For God's sake please don't tell him anything, Mr. Jawahar. He's ill. Mukta, if you lure one with your charms... you should be ready to face his wrath as well. Jawahar! When you can play with people's honor... then even you'll have to gamble with your dignity. Coward, watch your mouth, watch your mouth or else. Anand! A worm should behave like one or he gets stamped upon. - Mr. Jawahar. - Mukta, if you want the mansion's dignity... and your lover's life then... tonight come to my house. But, all alone. - You pervert. - Anand. Father, your Anand will make your soul happy today. He'll get himself killed but won't let the village's pride tarnish. Anand, what are you doing? Have you thought about it? What am I doing? I'm going to save the honor of mine, my village... - and you shameless creatures. Leave me, Manglu. - Anand. Sister, for God's sake stop these two mountains from clashing. This is a question of two lives. You don't remember about the life when you... play with people's dignity? When you break one's heart? Don't say that, sister. You're a woman, too. Tell me the truth. What would you have done if you were in my place? I would have never done such a stupid thing. I'm stupid, but can give my life for my honor. What's that mean? It means Anand has made up this mind. He'll kill Jawahar. You think my brother is a coward? - He's a Rajput. - Okay. If that's what you mean, then I'll sob all my life for Anand. But even you'll have to suffer for your brother. Mukta, Rajput women are destined to live a life full of suffering. But they never surrender. This is a Rajput distinction. No Rajput has ever sent anyone empty-handed from their home. Even this is a Rajput attribute. Mukta. Mukta. - Let me go. - I won't let you go. - Let me go. - I won't let you go. - Let me go. My brother, my brother... the sisters have come hoping Your sisters have come to bless you My brother, my brother... - Brother, brother. - I'll wear bangles in my wrists Brother, it's time for the ritual and you keep hiding yourself. You are hiding because you'll have to give a lot of gifts. But who is bothered about your riches? I'm just hungry for brotherly love. You don't want to give me that? Forget it. Brother, get me the thing from Chambal My brother, my brother Enough. Stop this singing. Sister, you've become upset? Today on brother's day celebrations, I'll give you what is your right. Here, go ahead. Mukta, what do you want? Today on this auspicious day... what can a sister want from her brother? Then why don't you say what you want. I don't want bangles or sarees Nor do I want your riches Just say a word, oh my brother Call me sister with love My brother, my brother Your sisters have come hoping Your sisters have come to bless you My brother, my brother Jawahar, if you're a man then come and fight a man. What revenge can you take from women? If you have any pride, then come out. I won't let you go. You don't know he has a gun. He'll kill you. Please don't go, I won't let you go. Brother, don't go. This is a question of our pride. Today we'll show you how we villagers sacrifice for our pride. - Mr. Jawahar. - Brother. - Coward! - Don't do that, Anand. - Manglu leave me. - Brother. - Anand, today witness this Rajput blood's passion. Maybe you think that living in the city... has turned this blood cold. Come, shoot me. I'm standing with a broad chest before you. - Shoot. - Jawahar, if you want a manly fight then fight like a man. Even you get a gun. Just by picking up a gun a man is called courageous? Then, is a man called courageous by... scaring women? The one who scares women also has the courage to challenge lions. He knows how to retaliate. - Brother Jawahar... - But I'm helpless. Don't try to hide your cowardice behind the veil of helplessness. If you have courage then get a gun. A bullet can't do anything to a brave man's chest. Today I'll shoot you that bullet... which you'll never forget. - Take. I give you my sister's hand in yours. - Brother. Night by the river, will you stay or leave? Manglu. Just listen a bit. How much I've pestered you. Had I pestered the river goddess... then she'd be flowing from my hut by now. But you remained stubborn. See here, I am drying up. Now at least pour some water. - Panditji? You've performed many weddings. - Many. But, you didn't understand a woman's heart. Does she agree by herself? You should hold her hand. Uncle, you are sweating. Yes, son, I sweat and I will sweat till I die.
