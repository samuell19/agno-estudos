CBS is proud to bring you this special presentation. 9/11. It is an historic eyewitness account from inside ground zero. This intimate portrayal of a life-and-death struggle for survival contains some, strong language. 9/11 is presented by Nextel and will have limited interruptions. Good evening I'm Tim Donahue president and CEO of Nextel communications. Welcome to this special presentation of 9/11. Tonight we'll see a remarkable film that captures the extraordinary bravery of, the firefighters that fought desperately to save lives at the World Trade Center. At nextel we've had the privilege of working with police, firefighters and, other rescue workers at Ground Zero and the Pentagon. We've witnessed firsthand their courage and conviction. It is our hope that sharing this presentation with the rest of America will honor, these heroes as we remember the many victims of this tragedy. And so we present the next two hours commercial-free with only three short breaks, that will allow all of us to reflect on the contributions of the millions of, public safety professionals across America, who dedicate their lives to our safety. On behalf of Nextel Communications CBS and the Uniformed Firefighters Association, scholarship fund we invite you to remember their courage their bravery and their heroism. Tonight a new chapter within the most important story of our time. One firehouse. Get everybody out, let's go! Three filmmakers. I saw the second one hit the other Tower. In a place you can never see. On a day you'll never forget. ...Tower 1, evacuate de building. 9 / 11. Six months ago, tomorrow, these streets of New York changed forever. We all remember where we were that September morning. We remember how we heard the news, what we felt, what we saw. Tonight you're gonna meet three young filmmakers, who also witnessed what happened that awful day. Only they saw it from the inside and it's a, view the rest of us haven't seen until now. I'm Robert DeNiro. Last year two french brothers Jules and Gideon Naudet set out, to make a film about a rookie New York fireman. They had no idea they would become, eyewitnesses to the defining event of our time, but that they would capture the courage of those who faced hell on earth. And the miracle of a lucky few who survived. A story begins last summer, with the help of a friend and firefighter James Hanlon, the Naudet, brothers were allowed to follow the men of Engine Seven, Ladder One. It's one of the oldest fire houses in New York just a few blocks from here. For months the material they shot was routine, uneventful. September 11th was no different. Until 8:46 that morning. Engine Seven Ladder One was one of the first to arrive at the World Trade Center. Jules Naudet was with them and his camera never stopped rolling. It's the only footage from inside Tower One. What you're going to see has been edited with great care, still some of the languages are rough, after all, these men have never been tested like this before. This is the story of how the city's bravest, rose to the greatest challenge on September 11. When you work in a firehouse seven blocks from, the two tallest buildings in New York, you get to know every step every staircase every story. I'm James Hamlin. I've been a New York City firefighter for nine years. At Ladder One downtown. Last summer the summer before 9/11, there were days we'd go to the Trade Center five times in a single shift. My point is: we knew those towers as well as anybody. But nobody, nobody, expected September 11th. Going to Trade Center. On that day guys from my firehouse my best friends was some, of the first firefighters in the tower one after the plane hit. What they did that day, what everyone there did, was remarkable. And almost as remarkable it was captured on videotape, inside the tower. Beginning to end. And tonight you'll see all of it. The tape was shot by two brother. Jules and Gideon Naudet. There're documentary filmmakers and old friends of mine. I don't know. They always say there is always a witness for history I guess. Or that they were chosen to be the witness. The strange thing is the tape the whole story, it kind of happened by accident. I mean, Jules and Gideon didn't mean, to make a documentary about 9/11. We wanted to make a documentary about a firefighter. That's how the whole thing got started. JUNE 9 More to the point, the plan was to follow a Rookie. On the job we call them 'probies'. The idea for us is to show our kid almost, Becoming man in nine months. Which is their probationary period where they have to prove themselves. We teamed up and by last June the three, of us were out at the Fire Academy shooting the training. And trying to decide which one of the 99 new probies, will be the perfect Probie. -My name is Paul Denver. -John Cara. Antonio Benetatos, Tony for sure. -I was a police officer. -For a while I was a pizza man actually. Manesh pizza man. This is my first job sounds kind of cheesy but I always kind of wanted, to be a hero and this is really the only thing you could do that. Immediately, quicked, we said this is the kid, this is the kid, let's go. We got Tony assigned to my firehouse one of the biggest in the city. It's Ladder One, part the whole other company, Engine Seven. So glad I took this job. Can't be. Are the greatest. Incredible guys. They're guys who fought some of the worst fires you can imagine. They'd face the unthinkable. Question one was: would Tony be ready? JULY 2 I'm terrified. This is what I want to do. But it's it's scary. I just hope I can I can do everything that I'm supposed to do. You know I'm still worried about how I'm gonna, actually react when there's fire flying over my head. Here goes. -What's your first name? -Tony. -You come in on Thursday, right? -There's that. -I wasn't sure of that. -Thursday night. -I am not saying... -You need to sit down? -I'm a little bit nervous. -All right. I just I want to make everything, I'm supposed to do. Thing is, when you're a Probie what you're supposed to do. We got do the sheets, we change the sheets in the morning. It's pretty much everything. More news and traffic coming up. Its 6:22. ...we start at the top and we wash the break down. -I assure you I do not well be in... -A lot of trouble? I think I'm doing decently. You know, I'm still waiting for a fire that's all. Ready for a fire. And I think, that'll, you know, make a pretty big difference. JULY 10 Engine...fire. Thing is, guys say there's two kinds of Probies. Black clouds, white clouds. When a black cloud comes to the firehouse, that Probie, he brings all the fires in the city with him. White cloud just the opposite. No fires. Don't get me wrong there were fires. Jyst not when Tony was on duty. The kid was one very white cloud. Tony was nervous, of course. Very nervous. And as the days would pass Tony waiting for his first fire. Wanted to prove to the other guys and even more to himself, that he was going to be a real great fireman. Tony... So guys were not going to make it easy on it. What we set with Tony up, we do it to every probie. But before you can love it, you've got to learn it. Now say you got up there, now got your helmet, your bunker gear you got to get your mask on, how you gonna do that without let go? Don't look bad. Okay thank you. For two weeks I got 672 dollars and 25 cents. It's starting pay you know, iIf I want to get rich I would have become a lawyer. But, I wanted something that I'd be able to live with for the rest of my life. This I can live with. -A lot of the guys feel that way. -You need to get up in the, morning and look yourself in the mirror and say you're doing something with your life. You do your job you risk your life to help people . And to be part of a family at the firehouse. Just making some onions and mushrooms. For stakes. Tell me one other job where everyone sits down to dinner together. Every night. Now Steve you thought you got to be tired now? It's been four weeks I think five weeks, something like that. And I'm still still no fire. But it'll come. Probably when I'm asleep and not ready for it, that's when it'll come. -...to tell you in the morning Bro, you can't sleep? -Yeah. -Trust me when the alarm goes off they'll come and get you. -Ok. There you have Antonio, your first fire. It's was a car fire, at least. That all right. My first fire was in a garbage can. Listen Tony was getting closer, but for the record that was a 'flame'. It wasn't in a real fire. Go like that, it's gonna be fun 20 years. It's a fire over here. It's a fire. You see? Start your line put out the stakes. By the end of August we knew that we had the great cooking show. And there were no fires. Waiting for a job that was a very big concern but every time we would talk with, some of the senior guys they always told, us well be careful what you wish for. Yesterday 27 year-old firefighter Staten Island station, went to a job and he passed away. Well we'll go to the funeral on Saturday, and what can you say? I look back to last summer and doesn't just seem like a different time. Seems like a different world. At the time we didn't think there could be, anything worse than losing a single firefighter, and looking back we were all just kind of innocent, especially Tony. A bunch of the guys were talking about what different parts usually, get them at the funeral when the coffin went past, that was at least, was a little, uh, you know, I don't like... I hope it's my last one. It's a lot of thing going on all time, you konw. ...you got to get off. You know you got a really improvise. -Right. -You know I mean? -Right. Basically you have to be on the top of your game. -It's no a joke to show -All right. There is a lot of things to think about. ...beacause that gonna keep you alive, and that, -gonna give you the opportunity to save anybody else. -Right. Ready for that? Fire or no fire, Tony had learned a lot that summer. Sure he had a ways to go. But we'd teach him. Far as we know, there was plenty of time. A few days later Jules cooked a French dinner for the guys. At least he tried to. Decided to cook leg of lamb which I told, him for a long time one of my specialties. -I think I cooked one and we really needed at least five. -Miss Frenchy. One more meals like this and we're gonna be able to share... Alright, alright, get smokey, so what? We stayed up late just telling jokes and busting chops. -Is the best part to me. -Even though the guys, were making fun of us, because we didn't cook enough, we're all having a great time. We're getting accepted. World joke all night long. Was really a great night. Little did we know. It was the night of September 10th. 9/11, presented by Nexttel. Good evening I'm Tom Ridge. You're about to witness a remarkable display of courage, faced with the worst. The firefighters of Engine Seven Ladder One gave us their best. But the heroism shown on 9/11 happens everyday, and in every corner of America. Our firefighters, law enforcement officers and EMTs are doing, their duty to secure our homeland. It is our duty to support them. President Bush working with Congress is moving, forward on a national homeland security strategy, to give first responders like these firefighters, the equipment training and communications they need. We will build up our public health system to combat bioterror, use technology to help secure our airports and borders, and work to get law enforcement the information, it needs to stop a terrorist attack before it happens. The best way to honor the victims of 9/11 is for all of us to show our best. Contact USA Freedom Corps to find out ways to serve, thank you. Every day, thousends of public safety professionals dedicate their lives to preotecting us. Nextel is honored to bring you a few of them. Fireman live to help others live it's that simple. Everyday they wait for the call, every day that, passes without that alarm is a blessing and a burden, they know it's only a matter of time, until they'll have to put their lives on the line. So they wait and they wonder. For the men of Engine Seven Ladder One the waiting, and the wondering had lasted all summer. By early September the filmmakers had captured so much, about life around the firehouse except for one thing: a big fire. There's a superstition among firemen. When you go too long without any fire, be prepared. Something big is coming. What you're about to see is how brave men, work under stress surrounded by chaos. They trained all their lives for this moment but nothing, could have prepared them for what was about to happen. To be a beautiful day today, sunshine throughout, low humidity really a splendid September day, the afternoon temperature of 80 degrees great weather, for the primary election tonight clearing clouds... Begun to sound like some sort of a cliche. But really September 11th started out like every other day. Eight o'clock in the morning. The day guys were just coming in. I was off that day. Thirteen guys from my firehouse were on. Around 8:30... Engine, fire. One alarm came. In the run for, the gas leak or an odor of gas in the street actually. ...in the church odor of gas. Yeah, I don't think anything of it, you just hear on yhe radio, it's an odor of gas. Jules was riding with the battalion chief joseph Pfeifer, videotaping. Is just another call. Running with the battalion chief. It was basically camera practice. See, Jules had only, been shooting for a few weeks. Before that Gideon was the main camera man. Every time the battalion goes, I go. Youn konw, just practice. Why shouldn't? We checked the area with meters, and it was kind of routine. It was 846 in the morning. That's when this stopped even resembling a normal day. Right then and there, I knew, that this was gonna, be the worst day of my life as a firefighter. Immediately I knew this wasn't an accident. Chief Pfeifer made the first official report. We have the repor of fire. It looked like the plane was aiming towards the building. Transmit a third along, we'll have the staging area. Was probably a two minute ride but it, seemed like it was forever because there was a lot of things going through your head. People was passed and just looking up. It's like the world just stopped. We are just currently getting a look at the World Trade Center. We have something that has happened here, flames and an awful, lot of smoke from one of the towers whatever has occurred has just occurred. Within within minutes and we are trying to determine exactly... Go, go. As we scroll around in front of World Trade my mind tells me: wow, this is this is bad. What do we do? what do we do for this? We park right under the awning of One World Trade Center. Chief Pfeifer on putting his pants on it. Remember asking him: chief, can I come in with you? I want to come in with you. He say yes. -Stay with me. I go. And I hear screams and right to my right. There is two people on fire burning. But I just didn't want to film it. That it was like, no one, no one should see this. Pfeifer was the first chief into the building. Right away a guy from the Port Authority, told him the damage is somewhere above the 78th floor. But all you had to do was look around. It was obvious something had happened right there in the lobby. You just you just saw that all the windows in blow out. The lobby looked like the plane hit the lobby. Then they figure out the flaming jet fuel, had shot straight down the elevator shaft. All of this damage was done already people was all over the place. So you konw it's going to be of worse. When we got upstairs... My main concern was we had 20 floors people above. And we had to figure out a way to get them out. As it turned out we had no usable elevators. But with the elevators out, there was only one way to get up there. Walk. Companies come in. You see them with a concerned look on their face. And they send them. COMMAND POST A firefighter in full gear carrying sixty something pounds of poles and equipment. Takes about a minute to climb one flight of stairs. These guys were looking at 80 stories, just to get there. Then they'd start working. I felt the mood that we were gonna put the fire out. Everyone seemed to be confident, I know I was. You basically looked at it and said okay we got 1020 stories of fire. You know, we'll deal with it, we'll get up there. You know we'll get to it. There are fire crews just screaming into this area from every conceivable direction. By this time some of the top Chiefs in, the department had joined chief Pfeifer. Running the command post. Sending guys upstairs. Every time I looked around to, new faces Something that I recognize, is chief grunting, great guy. The perfect grandfather. Remember seeing lieutenant Fogui who was there working with 9th. And then started going up. Another of the men who went up was lieutenant Kevin Pfeifer. He was in charge of Engine 33, and he was the Chiefs brother. I just remember who we both looked at each other said a few words and, but it was more the look with it. A real concern, and this was a gonna be something tough. That's going to be a tough job it's going to be a long job. They'll put it out. That's what they do. The last time Jules had seen his brother, was an hour ago, at the firehouse. Far as Jules knew, Gideon had followed Tony, the probie, into the tower. When we had left for the odor of gas in teh street, he was with me, then. And the we arrived to the Trade Center. It went up immediately with the guys. So for me my brother is going up the stairs. It turns out Gideon was with Tony. Engine Seven, Ladder One. This is firefighter Benetatos. -But Tony was still at the firehouse. -No, I was out of duty. -And now he'd been ordered to stay there. -Everybody's been recalled. All available units must come back to the firehouse. Antonio tried to keep up with the phone. This fireman Benetatos. Gideon took his camera and started walking down towards the Trade Center. He was sure his brother was inside. And he wanted to get to him. Remember slowly walking down to the World Trade Center. What's really sticking in my mind is passing byes people in, filming them and feelings astonish. Eyes saying this's not happening. Remember tilting the camera back and forth between the people in the tower affordable. Both towers in the World Trade Center have been hit by aircraft both are in flames. Black smoke coming from both of the towers it's a horrific scene here. There's some debris flying through the air. There were two planes I saw the second one hit. They hit the other Tower. Well we knew that there was a second plane hit, and we had a lot of people trapped. Now the Chiefs would have to set up a, whole other operation over in tower 2. But when the second plane hit, that's when you feel fear. You could see everybody's eye. There were people from all over the world in the streets. Different colors, different language. A few blocks between the firehouse and WTC the entire world was there. Two aircraft, the first one on one...The second one... And they were all looking at the same thing and, talking about the same thing and reacting the same way. All the other elevators have blocked out. This a catastrophy, right? Says, were crowded. People were coming down burned. Upstairs in tower one the guys from my firehouse, are're now 10 floors up and climbing. If we did talkm there was to the people coming down. Trying to comfort them, tell them this all right get out stay calm. I run to find in a woman in the sea staircase. Her arms were all burned. She was just sitting there basically in shock so I picked off on the arm and, I put her in with a group of guys and I said: guys you know, take it down. I knew we had to get off to help people, they had to get up there. People pretty much said: why are you going up there? Get out. Their concern was to get everybody out. That was the key. As much people out as possible. Most of the people in Tower one came out on the mezzanine above the lobby. Then they'd get out through another building. The Chiefs didn't want anyone going through the lobby door. First it was because debris was falling outside. Then, it was people falling. You don't see it but you know where it is and you know that every time, you hear that crashing sound it's it's a life which is it to extinguish. It's not something you could get used to. And the sound was so loud. Just remember looking up thinking how bad is it up there, that the better option is to jump. The FBI is now investigating before plane hijacking before these crashes, were telling you about at the World Trade Center towers this morning. Pieces of the building and the planes actually landed blocks away. Gideon was walking with his camera when he found a chunk of, the plane engine that had crashed completely through tower 2. Just get out of here. Just go. It's evidence. You can't kicking this stuff. That was as close as Gideon would get to the trade center, without a firefighter anyway. So I decided that the smartest thing to do, was to slowly walk back to the firehouse. And find a way to go to Jules. Just getting word now one of the two planes was hijacked after takeoff, -from Boston. -This is... Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center, in an apparent terrorist attack. We have reports of a fire at the Pentagon, fire at the Pentagon being reported this morning. I was just saying that the officials are calling this an, act of terrorism and saying that clearly what it is clearly not an accident. Arriving back at the firehouse and Tony still alone. And he has no clue of what to do. Pentangon was set on fire. War, this is war. And just by listening to him, freaking out and swearing, and behaving like I've never seen, behaving. Tony was expressing what we all felt. At that point I saw the fireman in him taking over. Somebody has balls. A few times is just putting is gear and back rush to the door. Realizing that he is the only one in charge of this empty firehouse. And going back to the house watch and looking again and, there's this picture on TV, to just to make sure that it was real. Tony just wanted to go there. In the lobby the Chiefs were trying to run the, largest rescue operation any of them had ever seen. Next to no information coming in from outside. I've seen the entire world knew more than we did. Everybody had seen the attacks. Wverybody had seen the tower burning. Had seen the Pentagon. For us, we didn't have a clue wat was going outside our lobby. It's like a beehive that place. Everybody's working on the phone, everybody's working on the radio. Everybody's getting information, sending guys up, getting reports. And just trying to get this thing under control. At one point there was even a rumor a third plane was heading in. You got to remember: at that moment anything seemed possible. On top of everything, else just talking to the guys in the stairwell was tough. The towers internal communications setup had been knocked out by the crash. That left fire department radio. Suddenly you have hundreds and hundreds of firefighters in that radio. Seems to become more and more difficult. One guy in the WTC who was trying frantically to reach anyone on the elevator. And going through the rest. There's about 98 innovators in the WTC. On the middle of all this, suddenly, an elevator opens up. And you see people not having a clue of what's going on. They've been stuck in there since the first plane hit. I was seeing the look on the firefighters. It was not fear it was, what's going on? This belive, that made me panic over. Maybe panic. The first time I had seen father Judge the chaplain, this is called. He was in the lobby with us, and I could tell that he was praying. You know, father Judge would at least make eye contact, with you and kind of give you a reassuring look. That wasn't occurring almost like he knew that this was not good. Back at the firehouse, off-duty guys were starting to show up. - We're just waiting right now. -What you said? - We're just waiting right now. Tony was...just had one thing in his mind. This is bad to go there and they couldn't. And that's when chief Burns arrived. Larry Burns join the fire department in 1957, retired as a battalion chief three years ago. I couldn't wait I'd had to get down there because, you know what? they're my firefighters it's my building, it's my city. -...let's move together, get a flashlight. -Okay. Total probie, get your gear, let's go. Remember to me asking me to bring him some gloves, medical gloves. Go grab a box of gloves. By the time I found them and rush back they were gone. The Probie and the retired chief were lost in the crowd. Headed down to the Trade Center. I think at that point the lobby was pretty empty. There were just a few of us in the lobby and we were discussing tactics. Some of the outlying companies didn't know what Tower One was or Tower Two. So we're just trying to help them out by writing it on the destiny could obvious. Just before ten o'clock a little over an hour since the first plane hit, firefighters from all over the city were inside those towers. Hundred of them. I remember I'm filming chief Pfeifer, and he's on the radio. A situation that started bad just gets worse and worse and worse. The World Trade Center South Tower which was hit by a plane and racked by an explosion, approximately an hour totally collapse. If you're just joining us this morning of horrific surprise. ...right with people walking around, with sounds of tears holding their heads, looking up at what's left of the World Trade Center , just shaking their heads and disbelief. Out on the street, everyone knew what just happened. The South Tower was gone. The sword collapse and bran. -Everybody all right? -Yeah I'm okay. How's the way out of here? And then realize okay I'm not dead. Yeah right here. So let's turn on my floodlight on top of my camera. All right come on down this way. Inside the Trade Center all, Jules and chief Pfeifer knew. All anyone. That something had gone terribly wrong. They asked me: you with the light, help us out. We got to everebody out. Let's go. Pointing my light wherever they needed. Remember seeing chief Pfeifer. Evacuate the building. ...call all units. He gave it right away very calm. Dean White an interest for him it was a precocious, it's okay something wrong is happening let's get everybody out. From the tone of his voice I knew that there was no normal thing, I knew it, was time to leave. I remember saying to the guys well it's we're on our own now and, for the first time I looked in someone else's eyes and so fear. -Whoof... -Which you don't see with fire. Totally evacuated, was such a long walk. It was: 17, 16, 15, 14, 13... I was going down the stairs I can remember firemen resting on the landing and, telling them, you lknow, before the May, get out of the building. I don't think they... a lot of...I know for a fact that not taking serious. Light...? I was not even consciously filming oh it's just had my camera by my side, and pointing to the light for everything. I like to, to to actually help someone and then I realized it was father Judge. We saw him lying at the base of the escalator where we were. And I removed his white collar and I opened up his shirt, and I remember checking for his pulse. I realize in that time, he was gone. After that we had to figure out how to get out, oh boy we were. We go out this way. Right where we are now. People are still jumping. Debris is still falling that it's too dangerous you cannot go out this way. Chief Pfeifer tells the people carrying father Judge. "Okay stay here". I told him that I'll be back and wait here and I'll see if the bridges is still here. Chief Pfeifer want to check one of the foot bridges. Leading out of the Trade Center. If it was still standing, it would be their best way out. Did you hear what happened to North tower? South tower collapse. Now I wonder for the first time if if Jules is still alive. I realized that Jules could be dead, that very moment. And I was feeling, so responsible. I was the one who put it in this situation. Had to find Jules. Gideon hitched a ride with three off-duty fireman, determined to get to the Trade Center the only way they could. In a pickup truck. Battalion wants Division One. There were may days, being given and we start to figure out okay. It's the worse thing because you cannot have that name it with all that dust and that noise. May day, may day, may day. That's when I feel danger. For the first time. Was all around you, I mean, every single cell of your body is telling you, shouldn't be here. The air was radically different I mean it was this white powder everywhere. Take this mask. Get masked, we're gonna extras all that, and we going in. Just a few people here and there. And it's kind of silence. -The ambulance are straight down. -Of course so there's no word on casualties... The ambulances are straight down. ...but it's suffice to say the loss of life presumably... Amulances straight down. I was around at that point everyone's concern is just getting north, getting away from the World Trade Center as well as finding out where their families are. The South Tower of the World Trade Center just minutes ago collapsed to the ground. Only one tower is standing at this point. And the direct line of sight to what is left of the World, Trade Center the fire continues to burn, I can see the flames... By this time she Pfeifer had found a safe exit. And tried a radio the men in the lobby. No answer. We walk to bridge back towards the Trade Center. Still trying to call on the radio. Nothing it's good. The guys have been left there, they're not there. They had already gone out another way. Carrying the body of father Michael Judge down the street to st. Peter's Church. They laid his body on the altar. Father Judge's death certificate is number 00001. The first official casualty of the attacks. The chief, and Jules walked outside, underneath the footbridge they just crossed. and into a scene that none of them could even comprehend. And there's a corridor there's dust covering the entire place. And we look and the tower is here so it's okay, probably, for something else the towers are extending, the other one we can't see it but it's probably just, you know, on the other side and no one tells us. We walk north, just trying to figure out what, to place here and then try to gain some control. It was it just a sense that this wasn't good place to stay. Chief Pfiffer priority was to set up, a new command post and find his men. Right now, they were coming down the stairs Some point I started to run. I don't know if I was touching stairs on my way down. When I got about to three or two is when I started to think of my family, you know. So I gotta get out of here. When we reached the lobby, I joked about it I said the command post was abandoned. The Board was set up and nobody was there I said oh this is not a good sign. I knew there was nothing I could really do I mean, I was, not a fireman I had absolutely no medical expertise at all. As just a civilian. but as a cameraman, yeah, I was something useful. And it was to document what was happening. So the cameraman took over just him. Gideon had made his way as close to the tower as he could. Strange enough, the only thing I was... my preoccupation was to choose to clean my len. Jules was with chief Pfeifer who was plotting his next move. The firefighters for my house had reached the lobby and scatter. ...walk at this point, we knew we, were added a building, felt we was safe. Unfortunately there are people jumping out of windows. You can see them hitting the ground or around you, debris hitting the ground. Basically everybody was standing right in the shadow of Tower one. It was 10:28 in the morning. And this huge roar. And I don't even have time to think at that point, I just I just run. I feel someone jumping on top of me and, then the dust. At that point I realized that, well I was going to die. And the only thing I could think about was Jules. And I remember telling myself that if I would survive. I mean I would be a better brother. Let's go before the car blow up. And it's dead silence. It's nothing, no radio calls, no, no sound, nothing. And I feel the person was on top of me get up. And I recognize Chief Pfeifer voice. And I just realized just, you know, it jumped on top of me to protect me from all this. He say: okay let's go now. We get up, the dust starts to clear because, the wind was blowing in the opposite direction. After that was, just trying to literally walk around the block and, recoup and walk back to the scene, to see what we could do. Jeff, some water. In your mouth, open your mouth. I had been in this street three times in the last hour, first time it was full of people. The second time everybody was running away from there. At a third time, getting out the last collapse, there was just nobody. And everything was white. Everything was covered by the dust. The most surreal scene I have ever seen I cannot describe what took place. It is a scene just not to be believed the smoke still billowing what we do have, is a lockdown you can't get in you can't get out you can't go up you can't go down. I see that I'm still in the middle of the street, and I see there is a little deli it seems to be opened in the corner. A lot of people injured. Firefighters, a lot. And then it hits me. You know, where is my brother? I start realizing I probably lost my brother. So I tried to go back to the World Trade Center, I need to go find my brother. And I'm in the middle of the street walking and a, cop approached me and says you know, who are you with? With the chief, Batallion One. -Oh yeah? Battalion One? -Have an ID? ...take your camera and get out of here, all right? Go. So I go back up, walk north not really knowing where I'm going. No. we're making a documentary on the fire department. Well this ain't fuckin Disney Land, let's go. And after a while I said you know there's nothing I can do here, I need to I need to go back to the firehouse, maybe they have some news and mayb,e maybe, he's already back there but at that point I just, I think is that. And becomes, it becomes too overwhelming. Walking back to the firehouse. And not trying to think for one second about Jules. That was too much. They asked me what happened? What happened? I said: hell. Hell is what happened. It just came down and it wasn't supposed to come down. It's not easy being a survivor. Little to little the guys started to come back one by one. I can't explain why I'm here and there's so many dead, very emotional. My guys are crying. So many thoughts and emotions. -They told us to get out. -Too far I get. We got to call our loved ones. Tell them we were okay. It was fucking sick. Well we just got out, we just got out, and we have up two blocks, and I'm like I'm still not far enough. I just needs to be with... with the guys, you know. I was never so glad to see firemen in my life. It was it was it was a great thing to to know that, that people were surviving this. I put you guys were death. That was a scary thing I ever... Oh my god am I glad to see you. -We're the lucky ones. -I don't think it's luck, it's a miracle that we're here. Miracle, isn't a word to hear much from firefighters. Especially not on that day. But what else could you call it one guy after another was making it back, safe. Oh my god. I can't believe we all made it out, how did we make it out of that building? Thirty seconds, a little two floors higher... Again the cameraman just filmed them coming back, and asking them they had seen Jules. And nobody couldn't answer this question. It was extremely frustrating and annoying. One guy from the firehouse came to me. Then I asked him: you know, I've said, you seen Jules? I mean, you lnow where he is? And he look at me and he said: yes, he's behind you. And I turn over, and Jules was there in the firehouse. I didn't even seem coming in. And make me tear for the first time. Are you feel all right? He tells me yes. Tells me that it was all that time in the lobby. And...I know now, it's like to think you're going to die. And then, and then I tell him I got the first plane, and I filmed and, do you have enough tape? -You feel ok?, you get close? -Yeah, under. -Yeah okay, close. And definitely was miracle, you know? -...to know what happened to you guys. Everybody's okay? -Everybody right here. Everybody come back one by one to the firehouse, except one. Did you see Antonio comes to the house? He aware all accounted for except for Tony. Everybody was wandering about Tony. 9/11 presented by Nextel. Hi my name is Steve Buscemi. Before becoming an actor i had the privilege of, working alongside many heroes when I was a, New York City firefighter for four years. A scholarship fund has been established for, the families of New York City firefighters. Your gift can help shape the future of children many of whom, have suffered the tragic loss of their fathers. So please join me in making a contribution to the firefighter scholarship fund. The next time you see a firefighter, police officer, or EMT please thank them for their service to us all. There is not anything recognizable of where were the Trade Center... Oh that day, that day had change everything. Thanks God your fibers are here. When I came back that day to the firehouse one firefighter came to me, and said you know yesterday he had one brother today you have 15. It's hard to even describe the emotions in the firehouse that day. From one hand you celebrate. Somehow the guys from our house, they got out. We lost so much that in that two-hour period. We felt like we got the hell kicked out of us. I don't know what to do. Go back down there or waht? At the same time we knew hundreds of firefighters, thousands of people had to have died in those towers. And every hour that passed we were more certain. Tony Benetatos was one of them. Hey guys deputy chief Hill called first division, he doesn't want anybody else down here right now. Everybody was wondering about Tony. James just put his gear and went by himself to look for Tony. I come in from home, and yeah we were all in the stay at the firehouse. but after six hours somebody had to go and look for this kid. It's gone man. I got down there, just the seven World Trade finally collapse. No sign of Tony anywhere. It had to be only six o'clock. Nine hours after everything started, Tony Benetatos... that Tony just walked in. I walked in like your days, they were all like: hey it's been a tireless, you all right? -Throw your hand anything? -No. -You all right? -Yes. -You okay? -Yeah, I'am all right. I was in the building. Is everyone from the house? Everyone? I just asked did everyone get back, and they were like yeah that felt pretty good. You motherfuckers man I was so sure you all were death. And dig into a new...fuck is he chilling here even oranges? The last one that went out there came back. And we're all okay. I left here right after the first collapse. Turns out Tony had been with Larry burns the whole time. The Probie and the retired chief. They were right there when Tower one came down. I checked all the rigs. There were rigs crushed, paramedic trucks covered with, rubble flipped, fires burning everywhere, huge fires. That whole day I just searched the rubble, lifting things up, checking underneath. -Just very harmful. -It's only being a firefighter for. You know a couple of months, but he proved himself that day, To all the guys, you know. There was so much that we didn't know about that first day, who would attacked us? How? Why? All we knew is that nothing would ever be the same. And then of course do you the images, of the replay that never stops of the planes hitting, the towers coming down, and it was like...okay enough TV. Thankfully the power went out about that time so I just who's a relief. I got two more sets of lights coming. It's the entire downtown Manhattan loose power. It was really this feeling that we're going to be there for a long time. Most of us stayed at the firehouse that night. Trying to take it all in. ...on the roof of the... was parts all over the fucking place. ...feet, was nasty. You all right? -Yeah, I'm all right. One of the things that sticks with me more than everything I saw, as I sat down next to Ted, you know is real bad. He said: Tony man, it was... it was raining bodies. I just...the way he said it man, it's just, the man had been through hell. Good evening, today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack, in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts, It's a very depressed, like this, more miserable...mood. Hundreds even thousands of civilians are gone. As much as quickly you blow on electric switch and gone. That's it. Gone. It's hard to believe they're not there. They're not there. -First reaction? -They're gone. -Is no more WTC? -No. It did happen, right? It's not something that I'm going to close my eyes and, and, open them again and I'm going to see the tower, alright? It's not there. You know and the only thing you have really anyway really, kept it all together with us, as a group, as a body, as a firehouse. Around midnight we sent Tony up to lower the flag to half-mast, again. It's gonna be a lot of pain to deal with in the future. I have a pretty good friend. Well it was in my academy class in my squad. It was among the best sight. A lot of guys we all lost friends and family. ...to put that thing at half-mast again for the rest of my career. ...call Ids it's 24 on 24 of 21-24. We got word that we'd start digging in the morning. Some of the guys with wives and kids went home. Just for a few hours. They knew it might be days before they'd see their families again. And the kids came out and we just kind of all cried, and one big hug and, it was a, we just, we just cried. Probably the best best entrance I've ever made to a place. And I got home about two o'clock in the morning hop in the jacuzzi with my wife. But that's another story. A need more guys that I have, a couple... Came back to the rirehouse next day I couldn't wait to get back actually. Because I want them to get down and I figured well we're gonna, have plenty of people to that are gonna be trapped, for sure. We're gonna get them out, you will have to as you always do. I don't know if anyone's really pulledthemselves together. Focus on what you're doing today. I mean timing up in a couple of weeks, really taking what happens a lot, well guys but today you must focus on what you're doing. Calling teams in two. One guys called to go home, and probably you want to go home... We're all alive that's that's more than we could have possibly hoped for. So our job now is to go and do whatever needs to be done. And do it as much and as hard as we can for as long as they'll let us. Some of the guys took the city bus down, to what the media was already calling Ground Zero. Some firemen called it the pile for us it was still the Trade Center. Even if it was gone. Hey guys, here three ones, that means something might be coming down. So keep your eyes open when you're walking around down there. And I just realized, something that I always wanted to deny, is how evil, evil can be. We went down and formed up companies five men and an officer. We went to work right away trying to look for survivors. Guys were digging fast passing those buckets quick. Digging frantically. We'd be digging and and all of a sudden everybody would say quiet. And the whole place would get quiet and people would look. And then slowly they would go back to work and start again. And that was that's how things went down there. I remember the first time when there was like, you know, gateway to hell. Technically Jules and Gideon shouldn't have been anywhere near that sack. It was dangerous enough for us firefighters. Every step you took we could fall 30,40 feet to a void. Jules and Gideon said they had to be there but not to film. We would only take the camera and film for a few minutes. How we force ourself to take the camera down, because we just wanted to go there and help. We clear what we could by hand. And the ironworkers would come in cut the steel beams and lift them out. Then we just start digging again. You have 210 storey, office buildings. You don't find a desk, you don't find a chair, you don't find a telephone, a computer, the biggest piece of a telephone I found, was half of the keypad and it was about this big. The building collapsed to dust. How are we supposed to find anybody in this if there's nothing left of the building? Find a little spot, and you just keep going and digging and digging, trying to find something. You find a foot and then they said the building's gonna collapse. You run away. Go, go, go! And then we will go back, and, mostly just dig. We found, found a body, it was a girl. She was dead. She was she was definitely dead. All her clothes had been burned off her. She looked to be pregnant some people thought maybe she was just, bloated but I don't think so she was she was encased in rubble. And we had her about halfway uncovered. And you have a body bag already and then they told us to run. We ran. I never got to see if they got her out, ...saying are at least I got one person out. One family will be able to have a decent funeral. Our first shift was 24 hours and in all that time, there was one person pulled out alive. One. It was beyond discouraging it was even hard to understand. It was weird in a way, walking back to the firehouse, people were cheering us. But we sure didn't feel like heroes. Every day the whole of, strangers was showing up with supplies. -...you could use this towel. -Thank you. Thank you very much. They open up the doors alone behold, the deliveries were coming by the ton. Let's go right around the corner just dump on the floor. You can't eat all the cookies they're giving it. I know it's early any operation here but I just want to, thank everyone for all the hard work that they've been doing. How we're here? Only God knows. But, ok guys, thank you so much. I really, you don't have idea... Something special, you know, when guys are relentless. And just call it back and forth guys with nails, in there and the head taping it up gashes, blood everywhere just taping it up and saying let's go back, let's see what we can do, to make this situation a little better. There's got to be people down there still alive there has to be. Listen, we try to keep hope, and we look everywhere. We even crawled down into the stores, and the subway tunnels underneath the site. But the days turned into weeks, and we began to accept, it just wasn't anybody to find. But we never stopped looking. -Hey chief... -What's up? -We get another body over here. Firemen deal with ugly things every day. It's part of the job. But this was worse. Bring the body back. Day after day, it push guys to their limit. Maybe past it. Other guys don't know they're gonna do the job anymore. I know it's either this, or the army now. But I like saving lives I don't like taking them. Bbut after what I saw if there is my country decides to send me, to go kill, I'll do it now. Every night around dinnertime the fire department, would put out a list of fire fighters confirmed dead. And every night that list got longer. We regret that the department announce the dead of the following members: Battalion chief John T Williamson. Firefighter William Henry. Firefighter Eric T Power. Firefighter Emanuel Gornica. Firefighter Lorence J Virgilio. firefighter Timothy Asco. We lost so many people that everybody has lost, dear friends and I just wanted to... but the dozens. Most days there was a memorial service for some guy you knew. Some days two or three some days four. One of those services was for Kevin Pfeifer the Chiefs brother. He was last seen in the stairs of Tower one, directing guys to the fastest way out of the building. I would say that chief Pfeifer's brother saved my life. Saved a lot of lives. And I remember walking down West Street, and just remembering saying, you know, how much my brother and I used to love being downtown, and, in doing this job, and, and, and how now I didn't love it anymore. A few weeks past, and we got new rigs, well, used rigs, to replace Engine seven and Ladder One. They're still buried in there somewhere, under the pile. Eventually we started going on runs again. Playing pranks again and trying our best. To love the job again. But things will never be the way they were. Every now and then still wonder is it is it really true, you know. I know it happened but, I don't know how do you deal with something like this. It's the eleventh every day from when I wake up. As for Jules and Gideon it's strange how things work out. In the beginning they came to me and they said, let's make a documentary about a boy becoming a man, during this nine-month probationary period. Turns out Tony became a man in about nine hours, trying to help out on 9/11. You know how you can tell that? He's not bragging about. Do I feel like it's given me more of a sense of self-worth? Yes. Does it make me a man? What's a man? And I'll still watch cartoons and do my stupid things. I'm just a person who tries to do good, just like every other person in the fire department. For the fire department now it's about rebuilding, somehow. At our firehouse we've already got new probies to break in. Two guys fresh out of the Academy. It's strange to think they'll never know what it was like, to be in New York City firemen before September 11 And they'll never really understand what we lost that day. All we can do is tell him the stories, and show them the tape. A scholarship fund has been set up to support the families of New York City firefighters. Your donation can help shape a future. 9/11 presented by Nextel. In the end it's hard to weigh what happened on September 11. You can measure some things the height of a building the, size of its floors the number of people who work there. Bricks and steel are one thing but human lives you can't calculate that. Nearly 3,000 people died here on 9/11. Nearly 200 more at the Pentagon. Still more in the plane that crashed that day in Pennsylvania. You can add it up but numbers don't do justice to what was really lost. Fathers and sons, wives, mothers and daughters... A lot of us watch stories like the one you've, seen tonight and wonder what we can do. A scholarship fund has been set up to help the families of all New York firefighters. In a moment we'll tell you how you can help. There are many people still working here at ground zero. It's now hallowed ground. So every day 24 hours a day seven days a week, the work goes on and the hope that it'll give, the families, of those who were lost, some peace. People have asked us why we wanted to show this material? Part of it was history but the other part is personal. The men who shot this material wanted the world, to see this moment in history as they saw it. Not a moment of terror but one of strength. When good men did great things, tens of thousands were saved by simple acts of courage. We hope that will be the true legacy of the men from Engine Seven Ladder One. It's the legacy of all those who are on duty tonight. And every night men and women waiting for a chance to answer the call, in tribute to all those who lost their lives in 9/11. I'm Robert DeNiro, goodnight. THE FILM IS DEDICATED TO ALL THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE ATTACKS ON 9/11 LET US NEVER FORGOT They lay down their lives for strangers. They were inspired by their sense of duty. And their love for Humanity. They did not live to know who had caused the destruction, or why. They only knew their duty and that was to go in to follow the faintest cry, to search for the trapped and helpless. And to save those who can be saved.
