Hacker. Yes, sir? When you're done here, we need to talk. Is a... Is everything okay? I said we'll talk when you're done. I have it right here, Mr. Tana. I have one of my best men here to deliver the case to you. You should have it very soon, and once you do, I'll wait for your reading. This case in invaluable to me, Duvall. You are to deliver it to Mr. Tana without incident. Am I understood? Well, yeah. This? This is gonna be the easiest assignment you've ever given me, boss. Consider it done. It better be. Now take care of it. You incompetent idiot! I gave you a simple assignment and you fuck it in the first five minutes! Unbelievable! Calm? I have a very important assignment for you. I don't know much about art but one thing I don't know is any rich artist. I'm probably not gonna be rich doing this but that's not the point. What is the point? For all that hassle, I best be pulling in some bank. How're you gonna get away with it? Get away with what? Chet. I don't see how someone as superficial as him could even stand to be seen in public with a lowly little art school chick like yourself. Chet knows when not to cross the line. There's a line? When did that happen? So what's Chet gonna be? An attorney. Which is something that turns my stomach. It's just what this world needs, another lawyer. Not all lawyers are bad. Now you're defending him? I'm not defending him. I'm defending the good name of lawyers. It doesn't matter what Chet thinks anymore anyway. It's not like we're gonna be together forever. When's the marriage? A couple months once we're out of school. I may be wrong but that sounds like the opposite of breaking up. You don't have the guts to tell him, do you? I don't know how to. And there is someone else. Who? Billy? Ew, no. Then who? I don't know his name! Let me get this straight. You don't even now his name? Where did you meet him? Yeah. Funny story. I haven't, actually. So you're stalking some guy? Yes. No, not stalking. He's just this guy I've seen around campus. Oooh, my girl's creeping on some dude. I'm not "creeping on some dude." Is the butt nice? Tell me the butt's nice. I am not having this conversation with you. Just fucking with you, chill. So how long have you been side-eyeing with the intent to stalk this guy? Nine months. Nine months? You've spent nearly a year infatuated with some guy and you haven't even found out his name yet? I haven't had the opportunity. Are you waiting to have something to do on your wedding night? Have you at least made eye contact? Well, I did look at him once and he may or may not have smiled at me. Ugh. You better hurry up and get the wedding planner on the phone. What do I do? Stop gawking and do something. It's not as hard as you're making it out to be. Just talk to him. He's probably not your true love or anything but you'll never know until you at least get to know him. What if he says no? He's a guy. What do you think the chances are of that happening? Do you think you could tell me why we were almost just killed? They had a gun, we didn't. Who was it that gave you that thing anyway? Hacker. Have me get this bitch open. I think you need to get rid of it. Who knows who's after that thing. Are you fucked up? I don't think so. I don't think this is such a good idea. What else are we gonna do for the rest of the day? If this guy's after this, it could be worth a fortune. Dead women can't spend money. I can sure as hell try. How do you know there's money in there? For all you know, it could be severed body parts. Ew. Doesn't smell like body parts. I can't do this, I'm going home. To who? Chet? I know you're curious, Amanda, just admit it. I'll admit that had I known that I was gonna threaten my life today with this little reunion of ours, I would've kept walking. Come on. I'm willing to bet you haven't had this much fun in a long time. Our idea of fun have always differed. I can't do this. Don't walk away from everything, Amanda. Not unless it's something you need to walk away from. And why not? Because I know who can open this. Who? This is the place. Well, what if he's not home? He's home. All the shades are down. Foster can have this thing open in a few seconds. Foster? Don't I know him or something? Probably. He went to high school with us. A couple years behind us. Can you trust him? Yeah. There is no place safer. Do we knock? Are you sure he's home? He's just checking to see if it's safe. Safe from what? Who is it? It's me, Lynese. Are you sure? I'm too good looking to be anybody else. Who is she? This is Amanda. She's a friend of mine. Is she cool? No, she's not cool. But you can trust her. Come in. Come on. You give them something to look at, they might see something. You weren't followed, were you? By who? It's whom. You know? Them. Now Foster, we're cool. Yeah, that's what they want you to think. Let's just hope you're right. We just need your help with something. What do you need, wiretap? Video surveillance? No, nothing like that. We just need this open. That's a nice case. Can you do it? What's in it? I don't know, we found it. Let's see, shall we? It's a simple lock, it shouldn't be too hard. It's not wired, at least. You say you found this? We were thinking that maybe there was something in it that could tell us who it belongs to. How noble of you. Are you sure this wasn't planted? What do you mean? I mean, left particularly for you to find it. I know what "it" means. I don't know why you asked. Can you do it? Yeah. Let me get my tools. Appreciate it. I'll be right back. Don't you think this guy's a little off? Isn't that kinda like the pot calling the kettle quiet? I'm quiet, I'm not weird. I'd definitely call you strange. Don't be insulted by it. What would you rather be called anyway? Strange or normal? I don't know. I'd trust Foster with anything. Okay, he's not quite what you think. Don't you think he's taking this whole conspiracy thing a bit too far? It's been done to death already. Chill out about it. All right, he's gonna get this case open for us and we can see what all the trouble was for. What if there's money in there? What're you gonna do with it? Buy myself a new man. I'm serious. So am I. Maybe you should do the same. Well, I'm certainly not going to do that. I could always ask out what's-his-name. What's his name? Do you hear yourself right now? Is that what we're gonna call him? Stand back, I'll have this thing open in just a second. Let's see. Yeah. Okay. Somebody lose something? A lottery ticket? We were almost killed for a lottery ticket?! Calm down, Amanda. Is it worth anything? Yeah, yeah, it's a winner. It came up last week, I think. How do you know? It has four double digit numbers. I remember everything. What's it worth? 500 thousand. Or, well, three hundred and 70 thousand, two hundred and 53 dollars and 89 cents, after taxes. Are you sure? Barring deductions. Now, you say you found this? Practically. Practically? - Hacker gave it to me. - Hacker?! Who was that man that was chasing you? I don't know, some big dude in a black Hummer. Oh my gosh. That man was Calm. Calm my ass, all right, he seemed more like hostile. His name is Calm. Who is Calm?! He's a myth, an urban legend. Well he seemed pretty real to me. That means this case is your boss's. Your boss? I thought you were an independent contractor. You don't need to worry about that right now. What do we need to worry about? We lost this Calm guy already. What else could happen? Besides, with a name like Calm, how tough could he be? If Calm was after me, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head. That's just a word of advice. Or, well, a few anyways. Do you have a bathroom around here? Yeah, upstairs to the left. Be right back. What have I gotten myself into? Do you know where Hacker got the case from? All he said was it was worth some money if I held on to it for awhile. Look, Calm's the one who came after us. Calm. Well, Hacker does small jobs for organized crime. This could be our in. I'm so sorry. You mean this is for him? Yeah, so I'd keep that fact quiet around Amanda. So we finally have something on Vito. Well, maybe. If Calm was after it, then he must be involved. I'm not sure where this leads you. It's a jumping off point. What have you been up to? I think we better get going. Yeah, my thoughts exactly. If Calm was after you, he'd track you here to me. You're talking to me. You want in on this? No, I don't want any part of a lottery system. Instead of using that money for schools, it could really be used for secret government alien research. I don't believe in aliens. Why not? Cause there's no such thing as a black alien. I don't buy that the most highly advanced species in the entire universe is just a bunch of short, skinny, bald white dudes. They're gray, you know. Whatever, we're out of here. Say hi to your brother for me. Here, take this. In case you get into trouble, you'll know how to call me. Sure thing. Just remember, be cool. This world is an unhappy playground full of crazy cartoon characters. That's deep. Watch your backs. Who's Foster's brother? Harrison. That's one fine pare of bluejeans. That's the kind of guy you should be hooking up with. That's him. Him who? That's the guy. Foster' brother, Harrison? How do you know it's him? I saw his picture on the wall. It's a start. At least you know his name now. You shoulda kept hanging out with me. You might've hooked up with him sooner. Did you ever? No, not with him. Harrison's one of the good ones. I never play 'em like that. But there is one thing about Harrison you should definitely know. In fact, I don't understand how you don't already. And what's that? Damn it. What is it now? I left my sketchbook inside. Then go back and get it. Unless you're afraid of running into bluejeans. I'll be right back. Make it quick or I'll take this money for myself. I think you'd be doing me a favor. Time's up. I'm sorry, could you please excuse us? I'll see you again next week. Vito, what can I do for you? My case has been stolen. And who would steal from you? An ex-employee of mine. I need your help with this matter. What are you going to do about it? I've got Calm on it. He should have it back shortly. I know it's been handed off to a couple of kids. Hmmm. Yes. I see your man watching the two artful dodgers. I'm going to need some more time meditating on this. Notify me immediately if the ticket changes locations. It is imperative that you let me know so we can dispose of it properly. Or otherwise, grave things could be coming your way. I promise, you'll be the first to know when I get it back. I have a job for you. I need you to do something for me. Yes, I love you too. Now listen to me. I wanna know who they are! Sorry. I can't help you with that. Yes you can. Why were they here? They were Jehovah's Witnesses. They tried to convince me into being born again but, well, I told them I was born right the first time. Debatable. You like lying to me, Foster? Let's see how you like lying in a shallow grave. Not lying, it's sarcasm. Didn't you notice my smug grin? Besides, you wouldn't want to burry them in a shallow grave aways. It wouldn't take long before the earth would turn up their bones back up to the surface and then some kid who's about to get some from his girlfriend for the first time finds them. She freaks out, he can't get laid. She's in the mental institute from the shock, and well, he's at home setting the world masturbation record. Then, of course, the police find them, trace the DNA and they trace it back to you. Of course, there wouldn't be any hair samples at the scene of the crime. By the way, did you get that thing wax or polished? I mean, it looks good, you know? Kinda like a Bruce Willis, you know, a real man's man. You love to hear yourself talk, don't you, Foster? I love the way you put emphasis on each little grunt. You talk so much because I make you nervous. No, I talk so much because I know how much it pisses you off. I love to see the little veins on your forehead throbbing. You know, for a guy with the name Calm, you sure have a lot of pent up anger issues. You ever thought about seeing a therapist about that? Maybe while you're at it, check why you're still nothing but Vito's lapdog. You have any idea how easily I could kill you? I'd just come back as a poltergeist and at the most inopportune times, shove things up your ass. Anything you have on me, it's not gonna keep you alive forever. It will. For long enough. We'll see. Since when did you take up drawing, Foster? It's a pastime. Who's A. Ross? That's a pen name. You know, if you're gonna get those people, you should probably get going. "Those aren't the girls you're looking for." You always think you're so clever, don't you? I have to admit, sometimes you do surprise me. I'm just full of surprises. Oh, don't hurt yourself thinking with that big brain of yours. I know one of their names now. You keep the book. Do you think Foster will be okay? We basically led that guy right to him. Believe me, Foster can take care of himself. Someday I'll tell you some stories. I just remember him being this weird guy from high school. You never knew him. And how did you? I may have been your only friend in high school but I knew everybody. I had other friends. You were my best friend though. Man, we had some crazy times. Some of the crazy shit you would put me through. What happened? You know what happened. You just don't want to admit it. Did you ever think that maybe it was my decision? Maybe I didn't want to see where you'd end up. I'm right here. I always hate it when you would never say what you actually meant. Just say it! Okay, maybe I didn't wanna be friends with a drug dealer for the rest of my life, okay? Things weren't like this before your mom. Don't! You know, you used to be the one person I could trust to tell the truth to. Now I doubt you'd even listen. I'm going home. I'll mail you half of the ticket. Agent Julie Franklin? You must be Foster. I am, at least, that's with my mother. I'd prefer something more sophisticated. You can't pick your parents. Well it's nice to meet you, Foster. Thank you for contacting me. But I am curious, how did you get my... You helped investigate the murder of Dian Watson. Correct? I did. Local law enforcement asked for our help. How did you know that? We kept the FBI's involvement in that case pretty low key. I can find anything. But she was my friend's mother, so I considered it personal. I see. Is this a vendetta then? I don't believe in vengeance, Agent Franklin. I believe in doing what's right. Sometimes that means stepping out of your comfort zone. Which is why I'm here. Worried about someone, Foster? We can protect you. Always worried. Only the paranoid survive. Not sure if I can trust you completely yet. So I'll take care of myself. I did hear good things about you after your investigation with Dian's murderer. So I felt like you were the person to bring this to. You weren't very specific with the information when you contacted me. But the names you dropped intrigued me. That's because this won't see a computer. Too easy to get hacked. Kids these days just don't understand that old tricks work in a new world. You're my personal research. You do your review on this and you'll find them. You don't hurt for confidence, do you? Not confident, just thorough. I want him to go down almost as badly as my friend does. If Dian was your friend's mother, you must referring to Lynese. That's right. Didn't she become a drug dealer? That's just her front. She's been going after him ever since her mother was murdered. No better hiding place than in plain sight of your target, right? Besides, she's used her money she's made to put herself through law school. Impressive. Also very dangerous. You both should let us handle this. No offense but we have and where's that left us? Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands to get things done. No offense taken but I do my time. Well that's why I'm here. I have access to most of the people in Vito's circle. Most of them can't stand him. I think you can use them to turn on Vito. Maybe offer immunity. I'm not offering any immunity to murders, Foster. That's where it goes too far. I understand that. You have a trio of hit men that either work or have worked for Vito. Let them take each other out. Then whoever's left standing, you take them down. Save these tax payers a lot of money in the long run. I take it this is what you meant by "step outside your comfort zone." I'm glad you're paying attention, Agent Franklin. Be in touch. Time to get things in motion. Go a little more to the left. Oh, yeah, that's it. Duvall. Well, well, what do I have the pleasure of your company? Oh my God, cut the fake accent already. I know you're a fraud. Aren't you so smart. So what the fuck do you want? You know, Vito might buy into all this crap, but I'm sorry, I just don't. Listen, that man will cut you in an instant. So, Regina, ask yourself, is it time to kill or to be killed? Sounds like a business proposal. Oh my God, you know, that's exactly what it is for you and your boyfriend. Bradly. Come join us. Duvall. Little brother. What, you couldn't afford a room? I have a client coming in soon. Just taking advantage of the time. Hey, I'm not a hater. You get you pickle tickled whenever you can, okay? Okay, listen, I'm sure you two are aware of a certain case has been stolen. Yeah, wasn't the case stolen form you and aren't you Vito's best man? You're right, you're right, I am. That's funny, that's funny. You two have no room to talk here. But hey, I'm here to talk business. Let's put all that aside, okay? I know what was in that case. Color me interested. Oh, Regina, I'll color you anything. Hey. I wouldn't push from where you get your honey from. She makes a good point. - She makes a good point. - I know. So what do you need from us? I'm gonna get that case back. I have intel that it was taken to a couple young ladies who needed a little bit of help getting it open. The help they went to is a contact of mine. So I need from you two is to use no stress that he has on the both of you to put him six feet under. Yeah, I'll do it, yeah. God, he's adorable. Isn't he cute? Isn't he cute?! That's what I tell everybody, he's the cute one. Listen, I love the enthusiasm. Being a hired killer is just a little bit more involved than just pulling a trigger. Look, I just wanna be like my big brother. Our mom and dad would be so proud. As much as I love this little family reunion and all, how do I know I can trust you not to run off with the case? If, if we do our jobs right, there's a whole lot more to be had then just what's in one stupid, little case. Think about it. I'm surprised you hadn't thought of this already. You think he kept his entire fortune in there? No, he didn't. It's scattered about and we can get to it but, now this is key, we have to play the loan game on this one. This is not a quickie. Y'all picking up what I'm putting down? God, I've never been that patient. Well, I guess that's why you've never had a big payday. So, listen, I will get back to letting you two discuss things, how you're gonna take Vito out and all, I will focus on the aftermath. Deal? Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Shut up. Howdy. We're not buying anything you're selling. You're right, she is sassy. Lynese, it's okay. He's with me. Foster? What the hell is going on? Meet us in the alley over there and I'll explain. What the hell else could you possibly be involved with? Wait, wait, you found out the George Bush Senior was actually the second gunman on the grassy knoll and you just had to tell someone. Well, he was in Texas at the time and he did work for the CIA. Oh my fucking God. Conspiracy theorists everywhere. Oswald acted alone. Moving on. I don't think we can work together after this. Hello! Can we please get back to the situation that has us standing here with this man we don't know. My apologies. Ladies, this is Duvall. Duvall, Lynese and Amanda. He used to work as a hit man for Vito. Great, perfect, exactly who we should trust. My thoughts exactly. He'll need the ticket. Uh, no. We've been through hell with this ticket. We're not giving it to you. We can all appreciate what you've gone through. Let's be honest here, you don't sell drugs because of the lifestyle, do you? What's he talking about? I didn't want you to find out this way. Vito's behind my mom's murder. She's been peddling drugs so we can get closer to his enterprise. Wasn't getting any closer than me. Wait, so all of this has been happening in our little town of Syndicate? Consider my mind blown. And here I thought you were just being lazy but you've really been trying to take down the man that killed your mom? Why didn't you tell me, Lynese? You would've thought I was crazy and try to stop me. Well, damn right, it's too dangerous! And look where we're at. We have one of his former hit men standing here with us. He needs to be brought down. What'd you two have in mind? Well, I've been gathering some important research and I passed it on to an FBI agent you might remember. Agent Franklin? That's the one. You said FBI. Sorry, habit. The point is, she's working with us. She's gonna get him from the outside. We've got Duvall working from the inside. And between what I've got going on and what Foster's got going on, we could actually get this guy and we can get him with our guns. So, what do you get out of this? Finally, a good question. I get immunity, I get a much needed fresh start. Listen, I want out of this life. I cannot do that with that fucking ticket. Why don't we hang on to it? Besides, what do you need it for? I don't think it's just a ticket. Vito's way too superstitious. I think the numbers actually mean something. Besides, when I give him back the ticket, that's when he lowers his guard. That's when we can take him down. I don't know you, so I don't trust you. Lynese, I understand. But he's not just gonna give away his chance for immunity. And if he doesn't follow through with what we want him to do, he is never getting out of this. Ooooh. Please, everyone just take a breath. We all want the same thing. So as far as I'm concerned, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Good enough? I'll give it to you. What you decide to do with it, I'll trust you. Other than that, let's get the fucker. Now we're talking. Shit. What is it now? Don't let him know about the ticket. We're not giving that back, we earned that shit. Tell me about it. Lynese. I need to talk to you right now. Let's talk. What's going on then? I need the case. Case? Where is it? Oh, that case. What the fuck is wrong with you?! What?! What kind of shit are you trying to get me into here? I'm not! Where is the case, please? It's gone. What do you mean, gone? I mean, gone. That big son of a bitch in the black car took it! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the hell is going on, Hack? Who? Who is gonna kill you? All right! I can walk by myself without you grabbing me! Your beard is stupid, your gun is stupid, your face is stupid. Just get in. Asshole! Come on, pick up you raging lunatic! Oh. Hello? Yeah, it's me. Say whatever it is you need to say. I scrambled this line for any wannabe listeners. Yeah, anyway, I need some information. You came to the right person, I have information. Did you know that the moon landing was faked? I have striking evidence to support my theory. Yeah, I'm sure you do but right now I need to know where Lynese is. Where Lynese is? I thought she was with you. Listen, Foster, she was talking to some guy named Hacker and then some car pulled up and took them both. Looks like all this is finally coming to a head. I know where they've taken them. You'll find them at Dominick's. I'd hurry if I were you. Dominick's? That's great. What is Dominick's? Great. Thanks for the help. I owe you one. What have you got to tell me? Members only. This is my membership card. I don't see any backup. It's called technology. We're always tracked. So if something happens to me, you pay the consequences. Let here through. Let's see what a waste of time this will be. Hello, Agent Franklin. Would you like a drink? I don't drink. Of course you don't. Straight-laced and clean cut, just like an FBI agent should be. No, I just don't drink with you. That hurts. You can see, I'm very alert about your feelings. Let's get to it. What information are you going to pretend to have on me that you really don't, therefor this is not going to go anywhere. You're just wasting your time. Who said I had any info? Your greatest fears are coming true. You don't know me well enough to know my greatest fears. Oh, I know you better than you think. Your crew despises you. Everyone of them is turning on you and you're too caught up in your ego to see it. What crew do you speak of, Agent? You seem to make me out to be so much more important than I am. I'm just a small business owner trying to make an honest living. Honest living, right. Those businesses are just covers for your money laundering, drug running and anything else that will make you buck no matter who it hurts. I'm very offended you have such a low opinion of me, Agent. What could I have possibly done to offend you? You know, I started off as a local cop before I joined the FBI. So when I see a fellow officer get murdered, you could say it hits home. But you, I came across you after helping with an investigation into Dian Watson's murder. It was absolutely despicable. Whoever murdered her was brutal. Made her suffer. Almost punishing her because she was a cop just doing her job. No empathy for her as a human being, a mother, nothing. Carved her up like a butcher with a piece of meat. Whoever did this, whoever ordered an attack, they're not human, they're a monster. Hunting monsters is exactly why I joined the FBI. So I'm back in the sleepy town of Syndicate, Ohio to hunt that same monster. I'll be seeing you soon. You want me to take her out, boss? No, she's harmless. She has nothing or she wouldn't have approached me with that half-assed story. I don't now, boss. She sounded pretty dead on to me. Don't remind me. That one definitely got out of hand. It was supposed to look like an accident, not a goddamned dismemberment. Nothing we can do about it now. Let's go. Hello, Foster, have a seat. I've got a little present for you. Duvall, Dominick, Foster, I have brought each of you here for a specific reason. As you know, Vito's days are numbered and I'm here for a new beginning. You'll be getting him to sell more power to you. I'm not interested in that. Foster! Foster! I'm not done yet! I've never disrespected you and I expect the same! Sit down! Thank you. I want to expand my business and Syndicate is prime real estate. You want us to come and work for you? You got a problem with that, Dominick? Depends on what you're paying. I pay very well. Mr. Judge, allow me to say that I'm humbled that you'd ask me to be a part of your expansion plan. However, unlike these two, I'm not from Syndicate, so where do I fit in? We know each of you has a specific talent which I feel could help me in my organization. You know, I'm not interested in selling drugs, owning cheap bars, living separate lives. Those main things that government has good control over, the religious beliefs, and the prisons that has imprisoned good people. This all makes me sick. I want to legalize marijuana, prostitution and gambling. I've seen the big picture. And as for you. So I'm guessing you're planning on paying off politicians to complete these plans. You know, Foster, that's exactly right. It's still corruption. That's just your version of it. Sometimes we have to break the rules to reset them. People think the world is bad. It's not. But first we have to deal with Vito. And I need your help in this. So I'm gonna let you think this over. Okay. Anyone else notice that he didn't have a single drink today? Yeah, I did. That's a confident man right there. Duvall, we've never had the best history of working together but I can let go of the past and look to a brighter future if you can. Vito has to go. You know what, I don't blame you. I've never like that motherfucker anyway. Seriously, we need to make this quicker. We don't offer him a lot of details. That's your job, all right? We just take our cut as they come. Speaking of which, come on. It's too good to pass up. Nothing to think about if you ask me. Next question is, how do we do it? Oh, I have thoughts. Nice to see you again, Gilbert. What's kept you away so long? What is going on here? Jesus. Don't talk out of turn. That was for just being you. Who is she and what is she doing here? She was with Hacker when we picked him up. You seem like an intelligent young woman. How did this piece of shit drag you into this? You're mostly right. He is a piece of shit but I haven't been dragged into anything. You sure know how to step on your dick, don't you? Am I gonna get the same treatment? Would it do any good? Didn't do Hacker any good. That's because Hacker is an idiot. I got the money. But it was stolen. I swear it. That's right, it was stolen. Vito? Do I know you? Why would you know me? Is this a friend of yours? What? I thought that... You thought what? First you lose money gambling in my club then you steal from me to try to pay me back? This place... This place? This place is owned by me. Didn't you ever wonder who you were doing computer work for? You're a dumbass, Hacker. Where's the briefcase?! I don't know, okay? I gave it to her. So you have the briefcase? Do I look like I have whatever case he's talking about? He's a crack head. He doesn't know what he's saying. He runs up to me tweeking for some dope and the next thing I know, we're being jumped by a bunch of gorillas. No offense. So, nobody knows anything, huh? What do you think? I think you should kill them. I foresaw this deceit. Are you sure? This could be the chain reaction. Okay. Kill them both. Waste no more time here. Wait, wait, wait, wait! What about the case? What about the case? I know where it's at. I can get it for you. I know the girl who has it. You need me. All right. You bought yourself five more minutes. Are you all right? It's been a very interesting day. I'd love to tell you all about it but right now I really need to find Lynese. Have you seen her in here tonight? Actually I have. Her and a couple guys came here earlier and went to the back. Thanks. Whoa, where you going? I have to find her. You can't just go into the back without an employee. I'll go and find her. Hey, Jill, cover for me. Yeah, sure. I can find it for you, okay? I'll get you your money. You need me. Yeah. The thing is, I don't really have a lot of options here, Hacker. No, you can't kill me. You can't kill me! Oh, shit. Seriously? Nobody locked the goddamn door? Amanda? You know this one too? What the fuck was that? You don't wanna know. Are you two crazy? I'll explain later, I promise. Hey, not the face, not the face! Let her go. Honey, help me! Those two are in it together. She's lying. Her too. No, Vito. I've seen bad things for you if you let this persist. No more fortunes from you. Clear everyone out of here. Make sure those three stick around. I need to check available funds in an account. Account number is 0-5-3-6-7-8-1-3. Amount, 100 dollars. Thank you. And we were shot at and this big guy in a black car has been chasing us ever since. Sounds like Hacker's gotten the two of you into a lot of trouble today. Where's the case at now? We threw it at the big guy when he was running us down. I guess he has it. So he has the case. I would assume. You're going to have to forget that any of this ever happened. I mean that too. Do not give me a reason to hunt you down. I completely understand. Thank you, Vito. You're a good kid, Amanda. Don't worry about Calm, I'll call him off. Now the two of you better get out of here. Don't worry about them. Your job is to find the case. Now just do your job and bring it back. I have my reasons. What are you still doing here? I wanted some answers. To what? Don't give me any of your bullshit stories, Lynese. I know you better than that. Easy boy. What do the two of you got going on with Vito? We aren't involved. Don't you think you're in over your head with Vito? Hustling them is a far cry from what you're getting into. Me? It was all a big misunderstand. I'm sure. It was her idea! Son of a bitch! You were supposed to wait until he had the ticket! Bring the car around front. I need to get out of here fast. Yes, sir. Make sure the place is spotless when you're done with them. I'm just gonna give you two a little privacy. So you work for Vito? No, I work for Dominick's. Vito just happens to own the place. Not too big of a fan. But the money I can't beat. School is just too expensive. What are you studying? Journalism. Another month of school and I'm off to New York. New York? Why? Why not? You plan on staying in Syndicate after school? I hadn't really thought about it. What do you do again? I'm an artist, I guess. Nice. Thanks for giving us a ride. So do you think I can call you sometime? You mean, like, later? Yeah, unless you have a boyfriend or something. Oh, no. I mean, yes, well, sort of. There was something but it's nothing now. Yes. Here, put your number in my phone and I'll text you. Talk to you soon? Yeah. Text you later. Drop them deep in the river where no one will find them. Yes, sir. Hold on, you two. Those two aren't the only ones hitting the river. You. You're gonna turn on me? You better kill me. I'm gonna lay it out for you, Vito. Your treatment of those loyal to you is about to cost you. But I'll let you live if you give me all of your accounts. I want it all and I'll let you live. I'll drop you both off in the middle of nowhere because by the time you return home, I'll be long gone. You won't have access to resources to hunt me down anymore. You think I'm gonna turn over all my accounts to a lowlife criminal like you? I'm holding two guns on you and your choice of words is to insult me? Not a wise move. You know what? I'll find them myself. Duvall? Howdy, boss. Where the hell did you come from? Word on the street is that Dominick and Calm might flip, so thought you could use the help. I guess this makes up for the briefcase. Well, almost. Put him in the back with the others. Do you believe this fucking guy? No thank you, no welcome home, no nothing. What'd you expect, a hug? Foster, what's going on? Hey, Amanda, it's Foster. Yes, I know, I have caller ID. Of course you do. Listen, this is an emergency. Calm has Harrison. What? How? Where? I don't know the details yet. He's taking him to Vito's. Our plan may have backfired a little bit. I think Calm believes Vito set him up. We need to help Harrison. I'm going to get Lynese. We'll meet you there. Calm, what're you doing here? Where's Vito? Why are you doing this, Calm? Shit. I'm here. I thought I was gonna have to shoot this kid to get your attention. There's no need for that. What do you want with my son? I don't want him at all. I'm after you and the case! The case? I know what's inside, so don't play stupid. How about you just let him go and then we'll talk? I've had enough talk from you over the years. Exactly what did I ever do to you? You've been getting sloppy old man. That stupid psychic was one of your biggest mistakes but trying to sell me out was worse. And I hate that fucking jacket! Okay. I think I have a plan. Where the hell did Foster go? Fuck. Sorry about that. Had to make a phone call. How are we supposed to get in? Relax, I got a key. What're you doing here? Relax, I'm not here for you. I'm here for my brother. I see you brought your little buddy with you, Foster. Where's the other one? What other one? The little blonde girl. A. Ross. I'm here. Are you okay? He's fine. This is what you're after. Lay it down. I'm taking it with me. That's what all this is about? It's worth 500 thousand dollars. It's yours if you let us go. You're an idiot. I am holding a gun on you. What the hell is she doing up there? Trying not to get killed. Couldn't stand you anyway. Everybody lied to me. Do it. Do it! Oh no. Oh no, wrong way. Just give me the damn ticket. Promise you won't kill us. If I wanted you to be dead, you'd be dead. Don't tempt me. You want her, you gotta get through me. That's it, kid, give me the ticket. I don't have it. Hey! The ticket! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck. Who called the Feds? That'll be me. Of course it was. I wasn't about to let my brother in the hands of your hired goon squad. You don't have anything on me, just like all the other times. That's where you're wrong. How about a secret bank account? I'm sure the IRS would love to hear about that one. I did some checking after Amanda and Lynese left my place. Those numbers were more than just blind luck. They are the numbers to your secret bank account. No one knew the lottery ticked worth 500 thousand dollars was really account numbers with more than 10 million. Once again, Foster, I think your imagination's run way with you. What account are you talking about? We'll see. I've been looking forward to this for a very long time. And who are you supposed to be? I'm Diana Watson's daughter. Vito Martino, you're under arrest for suspicion of tax fraud. Let's just hope your boss doesn't find out about this. Don't worry, I won't tell. Try not to get shot over it. Thank you for your help. Thanks for the account numbers. You beat up a hired killer. I didn't actually beat him up. Location's disabled. Can't have anyone tracking me, now can we? Only the paranoid survive. Vito's gone the way of Capone but your former rival's still out there. Vito got what he deserved. The information you requested. I think this will complete our deal. Nice doing business with you. Keep an eye out for Calm. I have a feeling he has some unfinished business. It's only a matter of time before he realized it wasn't Vito who set him up. Do I look worried? I'm not, he has to find me first. See you, Foster. Stay out of trouble.
