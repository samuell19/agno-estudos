My feet. Pablo, did I fall asleep? You didn't miss anything. -Your bag, my lady. -Thanks. -Are you tired? -I'm OK, but my legs... -The shopping? -My legs don't feel like mine. -My bum... -Are we leaving the food here? -I think so. We'll bring it in later. -OK. -Have you left anything in the car? -No. -Fresh air! -Awesome. -I'll lock it up. -There's no need. I've not been here forever. -This was a great plan. -Wait, we've only just got here. Wow! It's beautiful! Very nice. Oh wow, they've completely renovated it! I don't know what it was like before, but now it's... -Tip top? -Tip top. Alba, did you bring walking boots? Well, no... I told her at least a million times. -Let's look at the rooms. -OK. -The biggest is for me! -No! �Alba! -Wait! -Come on. We'll draw straws. I won! A beer. Are they all the bags we have? Water? Who brought water? What water? Bottled water. What for? There's spring water here. There's no water. Now I see why we got a discount. Alright, sorry. Communication error with the landlord. Maybe he mentioned it, I don't remember. I'm sorry. I'll take a look for the stopcock. OK, thanks. Why don't you try calling the guy? I think he's on holiday in Croatia. I think... Dude... It's no big deal, we'll shower at home tomorrow. I want a shower today. -We've got beer. -That's the attitude. -Sod it. -I don't mind. There are alternatives. Put that in the fridge. The sauce is delicious. It tastes great. Did you make it? It's really easy. Very traditional. With leeks... Your father. I'll call him later. Alba, great plan. Fuck, I needed it, I was up to here with the city. You say that as if we live in the centre of London. Some people were hard to convince. I won't mention names. With everything I've got going on... I needed some fresh air. Working peoples' problems. I don't know if selling coffee pods is a job or a prison sentence. Look at us two. On the dole. -Well, you're a youtuber. -Yeah, but I don't... -You're a youtuber? -Youtuber? -Yes. -Seriously? But, does it make any money? For now, they're sending me free boxers and yoghurts. Man, if you knew what they paid me. And you two? They create infrastructure for the Death Star, for a company called the Dark Side. -Forever the fool, Alba. -What a geek. We work for a renewable energy company. We analyse the technical and economical viability of projects, optimization, management of installations, energy use... There's lots going on. Lots of work, lots to do, it never ends. Haven't you got it wrong? Well... Not you, I mean everyone, suddenly, it's as if work... and stress, at any cost, is OK. And no, it's not OK. I mean... I prefer... I prioritise life, live for the day, because things are crazy out there. But you live with your dad. I care for my dad, it's different. The labour system is screwed up. Well, technically, the... Yes, technically it's shit. It's a piece of shit. I've got a plan. I'll get my driving licence, important. And I'll find a fantastic job because you guys are all fried. That said, let's start drinking, which is what we came to do. -Drink! Yours is empty. I'm going. -Shall I help you? -OK. Hey, explain to me about followers later. It sounds like a good job. -You? Youtuber? I see myself as a youtuber. -Silence. -Time! Pulp Fiction . -Let's go. -Next. -Come on. -OK. I'm on it. A dice... It's a game. This is... It's... Jumanji! Come on, the next one.

Fire at will Knives and guns and bad mood You prefer me absent today That would be too lucky I don't want your understanding I don't want you to hug me out of compassion Do you think I'm getting a fat face? Well, a bit... You're more like your mother every day. What a bastard! Kid, your hair is starting to recede... but I like it. Thank you. Let's go back down. Why don't we go down for one last drink? We can continue with this later. No. You bastard! You can't do that. No, seriously, come on. Stop, they're waiting for us. Fuck them. I'm here. Seriously, Pablo, Pablo. Later. Later, OK? Patience. Seriously? Seriously what? We've rented the house, we're with friends, there's time, don't be impatient. Grab the bottle, let's go. Come on. Do you know my boss wants to promote me? I don't know what to do. Well, say thank you. What else? You know I hate my job. Don't take it then. Come on, let's go. You're always like this. Like what? You don't give a shit when I tell you something. Of course I give a shit, Pablo. I just accept your decision. It's your decision. -Maybe you don't care about me? Or my troubles. What's up with you? You only care about these parties. Sorry, you've lost me. I don't understand. We've been together three years. Three bloody amazing years. No, three years and nothing's changed. Well, yes. Yes, I've not changed and I'm happy... -I know you've not changed. What's wrong? No, tell me. It seems like... Are you trying to leave me or something? No. Forget it, we're just drunk. Forget it. -Are you leaving me? I'm going to do... -Come on. -The next YouTube trick. By Mancha. Hello. Did you know I'm YouTube's new psychic? I can predict your future. Don't believe me? Choose a card, OK? Any card. Choose the one you want. ...what time? -I don't know. -Don't you remember? -We we had such a good time. I know we had a good time... Between what we ate yesterday... Virtually nothing. -And what you drank. -What you drank. -That too. -All that together... -You don't have to eat it. I've not been like that for ages. Claudia, are you coming to celebrate my birthday Thursday? Both of you. -Your birthday was two weeks ago. -But I'm celebrating Thursday. No, I think I'll pass. What do I say when the others ask? No one will ask about me. It's Thursday. No, I go in to work early on Fridays, so no. You guys are a bit tiresome with your work. -Talking of work, have you told her? -No. You know we're not very happy with our working conditions. Yes, I know. I've been offered a job at one of the best energy companies in Germany. Oh wow! That's great. It sounds good. -It's in Frankfurt. It's a huge salary. Permanent. It's a steal. -That's how it should be here. Have you made a decision? Yes. We're going to live there. You're both going? It's decided? When? In September. So like, now. Yeah. Well, that's cool, right? Yes, I just hope I can find a job quickly. -But... -You will. -I hope so. -I'm sure you will. I'm really happy for you. It's cool. Right, are we going to look at the pools I told you about? What pools? On the other side of the bridge. 20 minutes walk, more or less. -The rope bridge? -Yes. -I'm not going over there. Don't be a chicken! I'm not a chicken. That bridge is ready to fall down. The second Indiana Jones . No thanks. It's a classic, my love. Indiana Jones and the guy who's like a Latin Darth Maul. Haven't you seen it? Indiana Jones cuts the bridge, it falls, there are crocodiles. They hang on to it. The blonde woman and the Chinese kid... You guys go, I'll stay here. -Sure? -Yes. We won't be long, then we can get going. You're dicing with death. -Do you remember? -No. I'll put it on later. OLD WEAPONS FACTORY Shit. Alba. -What? -Where were you? Are you OK? You said five minutes, you were 40. Your phone is off. Calm down. I went to the river for water. Did you bring some? Please, it doesn't matter, we're ready to leave. Do you need anything? No. Sira? No, right? We can get drinks on the way, let's get going. Yes, there's a match. We're leaving for a bloody match. Honestly... -It's Real Madrid and Barcelona! Thanks. What's wrong with that guy? Let's lock the house. -No! -Fuck! Damn it, shit. -Shit. -Are you OK? I cut myself, damn it. Let's tidy this up, then I'll... Now they're cleaning the house! -Alba, we're late, come on, please. -Alright, Mark. Calm down, they're here. -Share the videos. -Yes, please. Have you got any? Yes, I filmed one. Claudia, you've got videos, right? What are you doing? Mark. Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. -I told you she's awake. Mark, what are you doing? Mark, have we left something? I haven't. Did you bring water? -It's obvious she was awake. -Fine, you win. Honestly, guys, my head's killing me. Hello, how are you? The house keys. What keys? You've got the keys, right? Come on. Come on. Alba. -Alba. -Alba. -The door. -Alba, come on. What have you done? There's lots to see. There's an old factory ruins. It crosses a river. -I've got a horrible hangover. What's all this? -You went out last night? You're crazy. So you went out last night, bad girl. You could've told me. I watched TV all night. Who was bringing water? There's none here. Alba, but she forgot. Go on, laugh. We'll drink tap water. The tap doesn't work. I'll take a look for the stopcock. I'll go with you. If a relative had cancer, what would you do? -What would I do? -Yes. Take them to an osteopath. Seriously? Before going to the doctor? Food is the future. The pharmaceutical and the food industry... But they gave it to you. Alba? This is Claudia and Mark's room. Look what I'm doing to their room. Seriously? Come on, Alba, let's go. Alba. Shit. Hey! You're up! What a surprise! -How are you? Did you sleep well? -I really did. Do you want a shot? No, you drank them all last night. Poor girl, give her a break. I didn't even realise there was a bank holiday this weekend. What? I always forget when they are. There's coffee there, in case you... How did you make it without water? We put milk in the coffee pot. It's disgusting. But it does it's job, so have a few cups and get moving, we leave in an hour for the match. At your command, captain. -So, how was it? Good party? -Ugh... We could have tried harder. I had a great time. Two days in a row, Mark. I'm impressed. Did you tell the landlord we're staying another day? What do you mean? An extra day. What don't you get? -The match. -She's still wrecked, so plastered... Hello. What was that? Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. -I told you she's awake. Yes. I swear I thought she was asleep. It's obvious she was awake. Fine, you win. Right... My bag. My feet! That's mine. The red one? -Mine. -This one? It's somebody's. -The shopping? -I'll leave it in the... Alba. The keys? What's that? Jam or something? Here's your bag. Alba! Alba! -Alba! -The door! -Alba, come on! Alba, the keys! I've got them. I'll open up. Wow! -This was a great plan. -Wait, we've only just got here. I don't know what it was like before, but now it's... Tip top. Alba, did you bring walking boots? Can I have the car keys? I've left... Alba? Alba! Alba! -For fuck's sake, start! Alba! Alba? What are you doing? Alba? -Fuck! -Alba! -Pile of crap. -Alba! Alba! Shit! What's going on? Breathe. Look at me. Look at me. Here. Alba. Here. Alba, look at me. Alba. Breathe. Good. What's wrong? What's wrong? Breathe. Alright? Alright? Are we OK? Good. Don't be silly. What a fright. You gave me a fright. -Yeah. -Are you with me? -Yes. Yes? You're with me. It's over, breathe. Come on. It's OK. It's OK. I'm going to sing. As this YouTube thing is so popular these days... I'm karaoker for life. My love. There's a queen among us. This is for you. My love, my baby, for having me, you're the best in the world. We've got lovely photos of the river. We'll send them to you. This is lovely. The silence. It's as if time's stood still. Alba, is this where you came as a kid? Alba? What? Is this is where you came with your parents? Yes. What did you do all summer? I don't know, usual stuff. Bike rides, pick fruit, bury treasure. -What? -Bury treasure? Why did you bury treasure? For someone to find, I suppose. Like some kind of time capsule? Well... Wouldn't it be awesome to find those things? What? Come on, Alba. Where are they? Around here? -It's just childhood crap. -We love your crap. Where are they? -Do you have a map? Is there an X? -I don't know. It was ages ago. -It'll be fun. Hang on. Hi, Alba. How's it going? Did you get there OK? -Dad? Did you get there OK? Alba? Yes. Yes, we got here OK. Have you been there long? What? Have you been there long? -Dad, didn't you...? -Alba! Did you have a doctor's appointment today? Yes, I thought you'd forgotten. How was it? Well, they told me I can stop taking the tablets. -Really? -Yes. I suppose that's good. Yes, it's good. Dad, it's great news, you should be happy. I don't know. You know how it is. You know I was going to the theatre with your uncle? I told you, right? Well, he called to say the tickets are for next week's showing and not for today. I don't know where his head is. He's a disaster. Dad, sorry. I'm a bit busy, I need to go. He told me it's the website's fault. -I'll call later. Bye. -OK. Speak later. Treasure! -Come on. -Let's go. -Come on. -Let's go. I've got no idea. -Where to start? -Is there a map? I put crosses on the trees. The house keys? Alba, did you bring walking boots? I told her at least a million times. But you live with your dad. The labour system is screwed up. Well, technically... Yes, it's shit. To old friends. And to new friends. Remember you guys are the best. The future? To all of us. Another. -Let's go. -Let's go. Where did you buy this? Are you OK? Yes. Good morning, early bird. Pablo. Good morning. Sorry, I didn't know if you were asleep. We're leaving in three hours, OK? -OK. What a hangover. Is something up? You're up so early, dressed and everything... I think we need some time. Time means breaking up. Just tell me if you've met someone else. It's not that. I don't understand. I'm getting fed up of your attitude, always treating me as if I'm a disaster. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong. -No. -Tell me. No. Seriously, now? Alba, are you asleep? Listen, have you showered recently? They can smell you at the back. -Shit... -You smell too, handsome. -You're a strange girl. -Why? Because... when I think I've got you figured out... you go and surprise me. Is that good or bad? Pablo. Are you OK? I need to talk to you, I can't do this anymore. Yeah, me too. I need to tell you something. I think we've been... I don't know... I think we need some time. We've been together three years and nothing's changed. Pablo. I'd like to talk to you before we go in. I don't feel like this is working, we're not good together and... I think we should split up, OK? I'm going. Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. I swear I thought she was asleep. Listen, Pablo. Well... Dad. He told me it's the website's fault. My turn. You bastard! Damn it. Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. -Shit. -What are you doing? She always misses. -There's none left. -There is! Drink. Whose turn is it? Nothing changes. I want to go out, you don't. I want to travel, you don't... You're a mess. What have you taken today? Oh! Awesome song! Let's not get too intense. I'm getting bored. I'm bored. Alba, are you asleep? Treasure! Mancha, get down. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Shoot, leave me alone. Can you move back a bit? More that way. Not too much. There. The sun was on me. Do you want some? -What's with the liquorice? -It cures my hangover. Don't you go a bit far? With what? I'm just saying maybe you should pace yourself a bit. -Has someone filed a complaint? -Well, yes. Your liver called, it said it's turning into pat�. -That was good. -Alba... We're 30 now. No way... Thirty already. Time flies. Know what I think? -What? That now is the ideal time... to... That's disgusting! Don't laugh, damn it. Sorry. Yes. House paid for, food, clean clothes... It's all so easy, right? What do you mean with that? -Nothing. -No, go on. -Nothing. -Go on, tell me. It's nothing! Right. Mancha, pass me the ball. This is a ball. I'll explain it, so you understand. Right, you throw it... -It bounces. Very good. Well, now... this... doesn't bounce. Because you burst it. Because it's deflated. It bounced before, now it doesn't. -It didn't bounce before either. -What? It doesn't bounce now because you burst it, but before, inertia stopped it. -What do you mean inertia? -What's up with you, Alba? Ant�n Verd�a is 32 and lives in Barrio de las Letras in Madrid. Last February, whilst he was clearing the house of... What time are we leaving? What's the rush? What are you doing? -A photo, we haven't got one. -Don't, we're all sprawled out. What up with you? What's up with her? -Is it a video? -Yes. Your friend's a bit hyperactive. Alba? Hyperactive? Yes. Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. -I told you she's awake. It's an hour shorter. Of course. Each time is an hour shorter. Claudia, does your face hurt? My face? Why? Pablo. -What? -Well... I've been thinking that... That we should... get trashed. Right, let's go to sleep. Do I look like I want to sleep? No, right? -No. Have you seen what you've drunk? Pablo. Sorry. -Fuck me... No. No. -Go to sleep. No, listen to me. I have to tell you something important. -What? -You have to stay. -I have to stay? Yes. It's going to be a no. I've spent nights trying to get you to stay... and I think you should stay, because... It's important. -No way, go to bed. Pablo, you're a spoilsport. Come here. Don't go. -You're a pain in the ass. Please. Look. Be careful. I'll bring you this bowl. You used to be cool. I'm just putting it out there. Sleep on it. Process it as you will. Alba, are you OK? Just wonderful, dad. Do you know what time it is? Why are you calling so late? Because we haven't spoken today. You gave me a fright. I was asleep on the sofa... Listen, Alba, you sound a bit... Dad, I'd forgotten how incredible this place is. I want to live here. -What nonsense. Hey. Alba. I've already decided. Sure, Alba. You haven't even asked about my appointment. 2 MISSED CALLS MAR�A GP Are you listening? We'll talk tomorrow when I get up. You're taking your time. What are you doing? That was for both of us, lunatic. I deserve it, I'm not well. What's up? Why are you not well? I don't know. I've got no fucking idea about anything. You drive yourself mad. Yeah, just a bit, right? Am I driving you mad? -No. -Am I? -No. I'm driving you mad, say it. Sorry, sorry. If I am, just tell me. And I'll go and leave you in peace. Alba. Alba, mate, where are you? I've been waiting for you both in the garden and here you are... And you're taking the coke, you bastards. You could've said, I can't believe it. What's going on? I'm at a loss. These two are all over each other. You, Alba, seriously. -What the hell is wrong with you? -Nothing's going on. Nothing is going on, chill out. -No way, I don't know what's going on. Pablo. Who the hell is "Mar�a GP"? She's called you loads of times. I've seen the calls, tell me who she is. Get out! Right, let's see. The house keys. Where's mine? Mancha, come and see this. Coming. TOTAL LOOPS UNTIL THE END = 10 See you later, eh? Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. -I told you she's awake. I swear I thought she was asleep. Pablo. Pablo. What? What do you want to do? Lots of things. But first, a shower. I want a shower. Why? No, nothing. What dad? Alba, did you get there OK? Fine, everything's fine. Are you already there? Is that seriously why you're calling? Yes. Why? What's wrong? Is there a problem? OK. Dad, I need you to give me a bit more space. Alba, I don't know where this is coming from. I'm moving out, dad, I'm moving. What? I'm leaving. I don't think it's the right time. It may not be, but I'll make it work. I'll get by, like you did. Alba, it's just that I had bad news from the doctor today. -But they stopped your tablets. -No, they told me to carry on. Dad, the doctor said to stop them. Why are you insisting on being sick? Maybe it wasn't a good idea to stop so soon. Alba. Fuck. Fuck that hurts. What are you doing, dude? I'm messing this up. Thanks. Can you search YouTube for how to make a homemade water pump? What are you on about? Really? Yes. -So, I'm searching YouTube... -Just help me, don't ask. Please. -OK, OK. This could help. The signal isn't very good. Yeah, it sucks. I'll leave it to load. You have to watch Mancha's videos. He's good. Honestly, he's creative. It's cool. -So creative. It's the truth. OK, OK. I'll have a look. What? Nothing, so what's going on between you and Mancha? Nothing. We're friends, we go to parties, have a good time... But no. -Silvia, I know your no's. "No, no", but yes, yes. -No. -No... You're right. What a disaster. Yeah. I'm also a disaster. But hey, it's no big deal. Hi everyone. We're going to make a water pump. Look. It's loaded. ...we'll be using the following materials. Four PVC tubes A rubber hose. -Great, I've got that. A cutter. Tape. And of course... A bucket of water. To start, we should take the longer tube and connect it to the next one like this. Well, let me know if you need anything. OK. ...we need the diameter to be wide enough. Alba. What are you up to so secretively? What's this? Wow, look at that. -Take that! I'm amazed. That's awesome. I won't deny it, this is ridiculous, but I'm going to take a shower. I feel like new. You didn't want a shower, did you? -No. Pablo, do you...? Are you missing something? Clothes. Right, no. I mean, recently, are you missing anything? Money. I'm missing you and a romantic meal. Pablo, how are you? I've been making plans for this weekend. I'll tell you later, OK? -OK. Don't you want a beer? -No, later. OK. -What are you up to? -Nothing, making a water pump. Do you want one? Alright. You're a nerd. I feel like new. You're like MacGyver. Do you want a shower? No. Come on, get dressed quickly, dinner is ready. -Dinner? But... -Well, yes. -Really? You and me? -You and me. -Me and you? -Me and you. -Dinner? -Come on, hurry up. Hello, how are you? I'm off! How was dinner? Well, you know that I love tuna omelette. Nouvelle cuisine is not for me. I wanted to do something you'd like. Thank you. A toast? What did you want to tell me? Well... I don't know, you know we don't... we don't talk a lot. I mean, we're not into talking. -No. I guess this is the moment for me to find... a coherent way of saying something that... will improve things. And... I mean, I'm happy I met you and all that. All that? What do you want to say exactly? -It's pretty clear. -What is? -What I'm trying to say. And what are you trying to say? Tell me. -This is serious. It's great that it's serious, but... I'm listening. -How are you? OK? -Fine. I'll be right back, OK? -Don't you want a beer? -Later. Get dressed, we're going for dinner. Come on! Can I turn around yet? No. -Can I turn around yet? -I said no! Is it done? Is there time for the factory? -Yes, we'll go now. -Can I turn around yet? -No! Can I turn around yet? OK, yes. Now. Oh fuck, fuck... Bloody hell. What's wrong? Dude, this is a classic. A real classic. Was this Claudia's idea? -Idiot. -So... This is a cave painting? This is a declaration of love that I've done for you. A declaration of love in every way. In every way. I mean, in every rock. Idiot, you should appreciate it. I appreciate it. Look, let's appreciate it. Appreciation done. Fuck me, it's just... It's nice. I like it. I mean, the... It's well formed. But it's nicer to say it than to carve it. But, carved lasts forever. -Forever? -Yes. Shit, damn alarm. How are you? I'll be right back, eh? Get a move on, we're going out. Do you know a good place to eat? I know an amazing restaurant. Come on then. Come on. Can't we go to a closer restaurant? No! This is the one I like. Do you trust me? Yes. What are you doing? No, no... I don't want to die. Right. Let's do this. Let's go! Careful. Careful with the... Good. Fuck. Careful. What's wrong? Why did you stop? No, stop! Seriously, please, Pablo. Careful of the caimans. Second Indiana Jones. Please. -Kali Ma! -Pablo! Kali Ma! Kali Ma! I don't want to die! Let's go. Let's see, do that again. Your hair has grown. -No way. -Yes. -No. Yes, yes. You worked hard. It was all great. That's why this restaurant has a three-year waiting list. In three years, some people go vegan. Have patience with the new restaurant, it's inexperienced but it tries hard. Also, I think this weekend... has been worth it just for this. Eating here? No, to tell you I love you. What's wrong with your omelette? Does it bite? I'm allergic to parsley. What? Since when? -Since birth. That sucks. And... Well... At least the shower worked, because what a disaster. What? It broke as soon as I got in. But I had a wash with the water in the bucket. No problem. I appreciate it. It's getting dark. Who's Maria GP? What? Who's Mar�a GP? My psychologist. Since when? And what for? Why are you seeing a psychologist? Ah, of course. She said leave me, I'm not right for you. It's not that. Why don't you just give me a chance? I need time. Time... I'm out of bloody time. Hey, Alba? Stop the car. Do you know Claudia has the same shirt? Can you stop the car, please? What? Stop the bloody car. -Are you OK? -No. Can you stop? -I'll stop now. Stop, damn it. I said stop. -OK. -Stop! Alright, I've stopped. -Hey! -I've stopped. -Fuck, man. -Alba, what's wrong? -Leave me alone. -Alba, what's wrong? I didn't get much sleep. You went out, right? Leave me alone, I'm sick to death of you lot. Calm down. Shut your fucking mouth. What's going on? -Stop! -Shut up. Why go to Germany? You fucking retard! That's enough! Why go to Germany? Because he's got a job, right? What will you do? Wait around until you get a job you don't fucking like. Don't kid yourself. I swear I don't recognise you. That's it. My love, my love, are you OK? Are you OK, my darling? Sure? What the hell are you doing? Don't touch me, now you too? Have we all gone mad? If you're on edge hit your head on that tree. Don't touch Claudia again. You don't get it. She's pregnant. What? I'm sorry, man. Alba, leave it. Alright? Leave it. Leave me! Calm down. Calm down! We're here. You haven't got a fucking clue. No, I don't. But, calm down. OK? I'm here. We're together. OK? -Hello. - Hello, Alba. Did you get there OK? -Yes. Have you been there long? Fine, everything's fine. How was your appointment this morning? You sound serious. Is something wrong? Dad, why...? - What? -Would you lie to me? Why are you asking that? Have you lied to me? I don't know what's up with you, but... Why did you lie to me? You know I love you more than anything else in the world. I don't need to tell you all the ti... Alba, are you asleep? No, she's awake. I told you she's awake. I swear I thought she was asleep. Here we are with another entry in the diary of summer 1992. Indur�in won the Tour de France again, and I think he won the Giro too. And I want Cobi to win the Olympics in Barcelona, even though I don't like sport. Mum says that Cobi is a fox, but I've told her he's a dog. In a fight, a dog would beat Curro, because he's a bird. This summer is the same as the last. Mum and dad cook on the barbeque, they won't come to the forest. They don't listen to me. It's so boring. But I've got a plan. I've decided to explore the forest and bury time capsules. They laugh, but I'll be a famous archeologist. An explorer with no fixed address. They'll all want to be like me! Alba, stop recording rubbish and come for lunch. Mum won't care when I go to look for sacred relics because she's pig-headed. But my father, he'll be sad. But mum says he's really strong. Today he cut himself and it bled loads. But he didn't care. I would have fainted. He's stronger than me. Who are you talking to? Didn't you hear your mother? Alba. Alba! Alba, you're not... Ah, you're recording, sorry, sorry. Let me see. How does it work? Where do I talk? - Here, dad. - Let's see. Alba has to come to the table to eat salad and ribs before they go cold. Now, turn that off. It's off. It is? Sure? Come on then. I love you lots, Alba. I love you too, dad. Well, go, to the table. I love you too. Alba, are you asleep? She's awake. I told you she's awake. Yes. I swear I thought she was asleep. It's obvious she was awake. Fine, you win. Pablo! Where'd you like to go with me? -With you? -Yes, where'd you like us to go? I want to see the weapon factory. What's that? Me too. We could go together. What's on Alba's face? I don't know. It's a mark or something. This was a great plan. We've only just got here. Fuck me! This is amazing. This is lovely! I love it. It's enormous. I don't know what it was like, but now it's... -Yes, yes, it is. A little bird told me you're going to Frankfurt. Did you speak to my mom? I wanted to tell you this weekend. It's OK, Claudia. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. I'm going to miss you a lot. All 3 of you. Let's see what they say. I'll ask Alba. Shall we see the bedrooms or what? Let's go. You're so silly! You! Youtuber! You, with me. I'm taking him for an hour. Ah, there's no water! The house is enormous. Gigantic. There's no water. What? Nevermind, let's bring stuff in... -Yes. -Get settled. -OK. -OK, darling? -Beers? -Beers. Let's go. Are we in a rush? Come on. This is spectacular. It is. Let's go. Wait. What? Stay here. You're so strange. I don't know how to... What? I don't want to be someone who has everything... calculated, measured... I'm not like that. I know. Me neither. But I also... I don't want to live with a... constant hangover. I know. I know and, what's more, I think... that you've not been having the best time and... And I'm sorry. Recently, I've been through some... strange things, I'd love to tell you, but ... Tell me. It doesn't matter. It's not important. What's important is that I realised that you're incredible. And that I love you. I love you a lot. I want to live alone, visit when you want. We'll do it our way, at our own pace. I just need you... to give me a chance. I... ...need time. No. Forget time. What? What? What's up? -Fuck! I don't understand. -What? What are you looking for? -Nothing. -What's up with you? -Fuck! -What? -You're here. -Where else would I be? -I don't know. You're mad. You know that, right? Are you going to explain this? Over a beer. I've missed you. And me you. A lot. THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WKND
