YES, I'M, UH-- DELIA TYNAN, I KNOW. I RECOGNIZE YOU FROM THAT QUINTUPLETS SHOW. SEXTUPLETS, BUT WHO'S COUNTING? ANYWAYS, UM, COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES? YOU KNOW, NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME. [CAR DOOR OPENS] OH, UM, WELL, WHEN WOULD BE A GOOD TIME? BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER? SHE WANTS TO INTERVIEW ME, OR, US, ACTUALLY. WELL, IT'S MORE OF AN IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW. OKAY, WELL, I'LL TALK TO SARAH ABOUT IT, BUT, HONESTLY, I REALLY DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD GET GOING. OUR RESERVATION'S AT 7:00. OKAY, SURE. OH, ARE YOU TWO, UM, GOING ON A DATE? I WILL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THE INTERVIEW. OKAY. EXCUSE ME. SURE, BUT WOULD YOU-- WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN ME SHE WAS COMING? I HAD NO IDEA MYSELF. WELL, I JUST DON'T LIKE HAVING REPORTERS SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED ON MY DOORSTEP. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M SORRY. I'M JUST A BIT ON EDGE, I GUESS. I JUST WISH EVERYTHING COULD GO BACK TO NORMAL, LIKE BEFORE. YOU AND ME BOTH. I'M NOT QUITE READY TO BE THE NEW MESSIAH. YEAH, MUST BE A LOT PRESSURE. JUST CAN'T GET THAT WALKING ON WATER THING DOWN. WELL, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. [CHUCKLES] UH... SO IT'S ALMOST 7:00. WHERE ARE WE GOING? [CLAPS] BOWLING, ACTUALLY. [RUBBING HANDS WITH GLEE] BOWLING? I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE HAD A RESERVATION SOMEWHERE. I SAID THAT TO GET RID OF HER. NICE. IT'S HALF OFF PIZZA TONIGHT AT REV'S IF YOU BOWL THREE GAMES. I'M A TERRIBLE BOWLER. I'M NOT. THERE'S BEER IN THE FRIDGE, OR YOU COULD TURN SOME WATER INTO WINE, IF YOU'D PREFER. BEER IS FINE, THANK YOU. HEY, JACK. AH, SHE LIVES. HAVE YOU LOCATED OUR MIRACLE-WORKER? GOT HIM, AND GET THIS, HE LIVES IN A CHURCH. WHAT IS HE, A RELIGIOUS NUT? NO, NO, APPARENTLY, HE'S UNDER FINANCIAL STRESS. HIS MOTHER'S ILL-- RYE AND GINGER, PLEASE. ON THE ROCKS. SO, HE'S LIVING IN AN OLD ABANDONED METHODIST CHURCH ON THE CHEAP. HE GETS TO LIVE IN IT WHILE HE'S RESTORING IT. ANY DIRT? NO, HE'S CLEAN AS A CHOIRBOY. EVERYBODY HERE THINKS HE WALKS ON WATER, GOOD. SO WHY HAVE YOU BEEN SO HARD TO GET A HOLD OF? YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK, IT'S TERRIBLE RECEPTION OUT HERE. A WORD OF WARNING. GIL GRAHAM'S IN BETHANY. KEYNOTE IS LOOKING TO DO A SEGMENT. COMPETITION DOESN'T FRIGHTEN ME. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO TELL THE CHAIRMAN THAT THIS STORY SLIPPED THROUGH OUR FINGERS. I WANT YOU TO LOCK THIS GUY DOWN. I HAVE HIM LOCKED DOWN, JACK. WELL, NOT YET. APPARENTLY, HE'S GOT AN EXCLUSIVE ABOUT SOME KID WHOSE DOG WAS CURED BY OUR MIRACLE WORKER. YEAH, NO STORY THERE. THE DOG'S A GIMP. I GOT IT ON TAPE. LISTEN, JACK, TRUST ME. YOU'RE GOING TO GET A GREAT STORY, OKAY? GOOD. BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT UNCONFIRMED REPORT ABOUT OUR FELLOW CURING SOME WOMAN'S ARTHRITIS. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I'VE GOT TO GO. I'M CLOSING IN. WHOA. WAIT-- [SIGHS] OKAY. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY MEMORIES OF MY DAD. HE DIED WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWO. AND YOUR MOTHER NEVER REMARRIED? NO, NO, IT'S JUST BEEN THE TWO OF US. AND YOU'VE LIVED HERE EVER SINCE? YEAH, I WORKED FOR A WHILE IN FLORIDA, BUT THAT DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG. I MISSED THE MIDWEST. YOU ARE... A VERY GOOD BOWLER. [CHUCKLES] WELL, I WAS JUNIOR LEAGUE'S HIGHEST SCORER. WHY DO YOU THINK I SUGGESTED THAT WE GO THERE TONIGHT? YOU KNOW, YOU'LL NEVER BEAT ME, EVEN IF YOU COULD BOWL. [SCOFFS] WOW. [SIGHS DREAMILY] I'D LOVE TO GET OUT OF THE MIDWEST. I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO CANADA. WE CAN GO TO CANADA TONIGHT. YEAH, I'M GAME. SERIOUSLY, WE COULD-- [CAR HORN BLARING] TALK ABOUT SERENDIPITY! I WAS JUST ON THE PHONE WITH MY BOSS IN NEW YORK TALKING ABOUT MEETING YOU BOTH. WHAT A COINCIDENCE! WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE? THE STARS ARE ALIGNED. WELL, THEY NORMALLY ARE FOR ME. I'M JUST KIDDING. HEY, HOW WAS BOWLING? NOT THAT I'M PRYING. I CAN'T STAND GOSSIP. FOCUS POINT IS NOT A TABLOID. I TAKE MY WORK VERY SERIOUSLY. NOW, THIS IS REAL JOURNALISM. CAN WE DO THIS TOMORROW? NO, WE CAN'T. NOT IN A 24-HOUR CABLE NEWS CYCLE. I'D LIKE TO SAY OTHERWISE, BUT THE SHARKS ARE CIRCLING. DID YOU TELL SARAH ABOUT THE OFFER? WHAT OFFER? DELIA IS OFFERING US A LARGE CASH PAYMENT AND A BOOK DEAL-- WELL, A POTENTIAL BOOK DEAL, I CAN'T ACTUALLY GUARANTEE THAT YET. IF WE DO THE NATIONAL INTERVIEW. AND, IT WOULD INCLUDE MATTHEW, WHICH IS REALLY COOL. I'M SORRY, WHO'S MATTHEW? HER SON. MY SON'S NAME IS LUKE. LUKE. LUKE. SORRY. LISTEN, IF YOU'VE MADE A DEAL WITH SOMEBODY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. NO. NO, NO, WE HAVEN'T. WELL, I DO KNOW THAT GIL GRAHAM FROM KEYNOTE HAS CONTACTED YOU. NOW, IF YOU'RE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM, THAT'S FINE, I UNDERSTAND, YOU NEED TO TAKE THE BEST DEAL. YOU NEED TO SERVE YOUR OWN SELF-INTERESTS, AND, BELIEVE ME, I WOULD DO THE SAME THING IF I WERE IN YOUR SITUATION, BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, I AM AUTHORIZED TO SEAL THIS DEAL RIGHT NOW, AND I WILL DOUBLE WHATEVER HE'S OFFERING. WE DIDN'T MAKE A DEAL WITH ANYONE. [CELLPHONE RINGS] "FOCUS POINT" DOMINATES THE 18 TO 49 YEAR-OLD DEMOGRAPHIC... HELLO? NOW, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR DECISION... OH, MY GOD, YES, I'LL BE THERE RIGHT AWAY. OKAY. UH, MY MOTHER'S HAD A STROKE. WHAT? IT'S AN EMERGENCY. NO, GO. GO. I'LL BE FINE. I CAN GIVE SARAH A RIDE HOME. GO, YES. [P.A.]: DR. FROST TO THE NURSES' STATION FOUR. DR. FROST TO THE NURSES' STATION FOUR. DOCTOR? HOW IS SHE? HOW'S MY MOM? SHE'S STABLE. SHE'S STABLE FOR THE MOMENT. OH, THANK GOD. NOW, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SWELLING IN THE RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE, AND IF IT'S THAT PRONOUNCED IN THE MORNING, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO OPERATE. IS SHE IN PAIN? THANKFULLY, NO. I KNOW THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A CONSOLATION, BUT IT'S SOMETHING. CAN SHE HEAR US? NO, SHE'S IN A VERY DEEP COMA. [JOSH SIGHS HEAVILY] [NURSE]: DOCTOR? [WHISPERING] OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. PLEASE, GOD, PLEASE... I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO PRAY FOR. I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS. I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS GUY. [SIGHS] IF THIS IS HER TIME, THEN IT'S HER TIME, BUT PLEASE, DON'T LET HER SUFFER. PLEASE, GOD. DON'T LET HER SUFFER. WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, SHOW MERCY. [MONITOR BEEPING] DOCTOR? [BEEPING RAPIDLY] JOSH. DID SHE JUST SAY SOMETHING? YEAH, SHE DID. SHE DID. I HEARD IT. THE SPEECH CENTERS OF THE BRAIN ARE COMPLETELY COMPROMISED. [WHISPERING] JOSH... IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE. SHE SAID SOMETHING. SHE SAID MY NAME. SHE HASN'T SAID MY NAME IN OVER TWO YEARS. SO, HOW DID IT GO? WELL, LET'S JUST SAY I HAD DINNER WITH A REPORTER. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DATE? [SIGHS] LIFE INTERVENED. YOU LIKE HIM, DON'T YOU? YEAH. YEAH, I DO. ME, TOO. ANY CHANGE? NO, NO, I'M AFRAID NOT, JOSH. I THOUGHT MAYBE WITH HER SPEAKING, THAT THERE WOULD BE... YEAH, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT. THAT DOESN'T CONFORM TO ANY PATTERN I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. BUT, UH... THE SWELLING ON YOUR MOTHER'S BRAIN IS VERY SEVERE, AND THE ONLY WAY TO RELIEVE IT IS THROUGH SURGERY. OKAY, SO DO YOU NEED ME TO SIGN A CONSENT FORM OR ANYTHING? IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROCEDURE, JOSH. I'LL FIND THE MONEY. OH, I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S JUST... I JUST WANT TO CLEAR. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. I MEAN, EVEN WITH SURGERY, SHE MAY NEVER COME OUT OF THIS COMA. OKAY... OKAY, OKAY... [CELL PHONE RINGING] DELIA TYNAN. MS. TYNAN? JOSH, I'M HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU. I, UM, I WANT TO TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER. NAME A TIME AND A PLACE AND I'LL BE THERE. SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOSPITAL. NEAR THE ICU WARD? NOT A PROBLEM. I HAPPEN TO BE NEARBY. I'LL BE THERE IN FIVE MINUTES. [BEEPS OFF PHONE] [WHISPERS] GOT IT. [♪♪♪] MAY I? [CHUCKLING] WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU UP ON YOUR FEET, HONEY. YEAH, ONLY ONE PROBLEM, THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO DANCE WITH. NONSENSE, YOU'RE JUST NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH. YEAH, EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. ONE DATE, AND YOU TWO ARE ACTING LIKE LOVE-STRUCK TEENAGERS. [CHUCKLING] HE IS PRETTY SWEET, ISN'T HE? YES, HE'S VERY SWEET. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT... YOU SHOULD DANCE WITH CHARLIE. HE'S A GREAT DANCER! NO. NO, NO. PLEASE! NO, NOT NOW. I WILL ONLY LET GO OF HIM FOR A MOMENT. -JUST FOR YOU. -YOU GUYS, GO. AND THE MOMENT'S GONE. [♪♪♪] HOW'S YOUR MOTHER? CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? YEAH, OF COURSE. SO, UM... MY MOTHER NEEDS AN... SHE NEEDS AN OPERATION. OH, NO. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? I-I AGREED TO DO THE INTERVIEW WITH DELIA TYNAN, BUT THE THING IS, IS THAT SHE WANTS ALL THREE OF US, SHE WANTS YOU, ME AND LUKE. OF COURSE. OF COURSE. WHATEVER IT TAKES. THANK YOU. I MEAN, SHE WANTS TO DO IT TOMORROW MORNING, FIRST THING TOMORROW MORN-- I'LL MAKE MYSELF COMPLETELY AVAILABLE. OF COURSE. OKAY. UH... SARAH? THANK YOU. THANK YOU, SARAH. IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME. DID HE TAKE OUR OPENING OFFER? YEAH, HE TOOK THE LOW END OF THE DEAL, AND THAT INCLUDES THE MOTHER AND THE KID. HE DIDN'T EVEN HAGGLE. YES! GOOD JOB, DELIA. I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL KIND OF BAD. WE'RE TOTALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIM. IS THE DEAL SOLID? YEAH, EXCLUSIVE NATIONAL BROADCAST RIGHTS, SIGNED AND NOTARIZED. COOL. WHEN'S THE INTERVIEW? TODAY. I'M GOING TO SEE THE MOM AND THE KID, AND THEN RIGHT AFTER THAT, I'M GOING OVER TO JOSH'S HOUSE. THE CHURCH, RIGHT? YES, JACK, THE CHURCH. I'LL SEND YOU THE FOOTAGE TODAY. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL MAKE THE AIR DATE JUST BEFORE EASTER, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WHOLE NEW MESSIAH THING. WELL, ACTUALLY, JACK... I HAVE AN IDEA. HI, JOSH. SHE'S DOING AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED. [SIGHS HEAVILY] SO, UM, WHAT NOW? WE WAIT. WE WAIT. [P.A.]: WOULD MR. JUAN GONZALEZ PICK UP THE WHITE PHONE? MR. JUAN GONZALEZ, PLEASE PICK UP THE WHITE PHONE. [SIGHING] OKAY, GOD. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PRAY FOR THINGS... BUT PLEASE LET MY MOTHER LIVE. [SOBS SOFTLY] I NEED HER. JUST... PLEASE JUST GIVE HER A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. LUKE? LUKE! HEY. LUKE... HEY, YOU HAVE TO GET UP. WE HAVE TO DO ANOTHER INTERVIEW. [GROANS] I'M SICK OF BEING "MIRACLE BOY." IT'S GOING TO BE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. HEY. WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

THAT YE MAY BE HEALED," AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JOSH DONE FOR YOU. MM-HMM. [DOG WHINES] YOU KNOW IT, BUDDY. YOU CAN'T EXPECT PEOPLE OF NO FAITH TO RECOGNIZE A MIRACLE. YOU KNOW IT. HEY, BOY? LET'S NOT LET THEM PUSH US AROUND. COME ON, WE GOT WORK TO DO. JOSH, HI. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH, SURE. WOW... THIS IS INCREDIBLE! OH, WELL, IT'S GETTING THERE. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE? YES.

WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS UPLOADING AND SENT BACK TO NEW YORK. GET ME A C-STAND AND A FLAG-- GOOD TO GO, GUYS? YEAH, ALL GOOD. OKAY. HI, JOSH.

MM-HMM. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A WALK DOWN HERE. I'LL ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR INCREDIBLE HOME, BY THE WAY. IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY? SURE. YES, PLEASE. INCREDIBLE.

JOSH, HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN YOU'VE HAD THE POWER TO HEAL? UM, EXCUSE ME? HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN YOU'VE HAD THE POWER TO HEAL? I, UH... I DON'T KNOW. I-I NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THAT. NEVER? NO, NEVER. YOU-YOU ALL, UH, SAID THAT. WHO IS "YOU ALL"? UH, YOU, PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA. AND THE PEOPLE OF BETHANY. ARE YOU SAYING THERE'S SOME SORT OF MEDIA CONSPIRACY? OH, NO. NO, NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT. NO-NO CONSPIRACY, JUST... LIKE, A MISUNDERSTANDING. ABOUT WHAT? ABOUT THE MIRACLE. OH, SO YOU DO BELIEVE IT WAS A MIRACLE. NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT, YOU DID. UM...ME? [STAMMERING] NOT-NOT "YOU" PERSONALLY YOU, BUT NEWS PEOPLE. DO YOU FEEL PERSECUTED? PERSECUTED? NO. NO, I'M JUST, I'M SAYING THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED, AND THE PRESS CALLED IT A MIRACLE, THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN CALLED IT A MIRACLE, BUT I NEVER DID. SO YOU NEVER CLAIMED TO BE A NEW MESSIAH? OF COURSE I DIDN'T. JOSH... WHY DO YOU LIVE IN A CHURCH? IT WAS A CHURCH. IT'S NOT A CHURCH ANYMORE, NOW IT'S JUST MY HOME. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A CHURCH TO ME. IT... [SIGHING] IT WAS A CHURCH, BUT IT WAS, UM... DECOMMISSIONED, OR DE-SANCTIFIED, OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT. NOW IT'S-IT'S JUST MY HOME. DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF CHRIST COMPLEX? EXCUSE ME? DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF CHRIST COMPLEX? JOSH? GET OUT OF HERE. WHOA, WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE INTERVIEW, MR. CAMDEN-- YES. YES, WE HAVE. NO, YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION-- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? WHAT? WHAT IS IT? DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT I'M THE RISEN LORD? THAT I-I WALK ON WATER TO AMUSE MY FRIENDS? TURN WATER INTO WINE BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN SHOPPING AT WAL-MART? IS-IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? DO YOU BELIEVE ALL OF THAT? [SIGHS] TURN THIS OFF. TURN IT OFF! WE'RE NOT FINISHED, THE INTERVIEW. WH-WHAT DO YOU-- WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT? I WANT THE TRUTH. DON'T INSULT ME. I AM A SOUND BITE TO YOU. NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE, JOSH. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE-- GET OUT! GET OUT! I WANT YOU OUT. GET OUT. LOOK, LET'S JUST ALL CALM DOWN HERE, OKAY? WE CAN-- GET OUT. [WHISPERS] GET OUT. GET OUT NOW. [SIGHS] OKAY. OKAY, CUT THE CAMERA. --THANK YOU, DAVID. YOUR SON'S ON TV TONIGHT, HELEN. ...A SLEEPY, RURAL COMMUNITY OF 9,000. A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS THEIR NEIGHBORS, AND PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR DOORS UNLOCKED AT NIGHT, AN IDYLLIC PLACE, NESTLED FAR AWAY FROM THE BRIGHT GLARE OF MEDIA LIGHTS. BUT ALL THAT CHANGED WHEN TRAGEDY STRUCK. JOSH CAMDEN TELLS THE STORY. HERE'S JOSH! [EVERYONE CHEERING] I WAS FISHING BY MYSELF AT FRYMAN LAKE AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF SOME BOYS SHOUTING, AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST PLAYING, BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG. [TYNAN]: 12-YEAR-OLD LUKE QUINN HAD BEEN PLAYING DOWN IN THIS AREA WITH HIS FRIENDS, SWINGING ON THAT TIRE BETWEEN TWO TREES. NOW, THIS TREE DOWN HERE BROKE, AND LUKE ENDED UP TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE WATER IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. JOSH CAMDEN, WHO HAD BEEN FISHING NEARBY, TRIED TO RESUSCITATE LUKE, BUT HE WAS UNRESPONSIVE. LUKE WAS RUSHED TO BETHANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, WHERE DOCTORS AND NURSES DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO REVIVE HIM, BUT THEIR EFFORTS FAILED. AFTER SHOWING NO VITAL SIGNS FOR OVER AN HOUR, LUKE QUINN OF BETHANY, WISCONSIN WAS DECLARED DEAD. THEN, SOMETHING OCCURRED THAT MANY PEOPLE CHARACTERIZED AS, WELL, A MIRACLE. [NURSE]: IT WAS A MIRACLE, I'LL TELL YOU. OH, LOOK, HELEN, IT'S ME! THE BOY HAD NO VITAL SIGNS FOR OVER AN HOUR. NONE. AND MR. CAMDEN PUT HIS HANDS ON HIM, AND HE CAME BACK TO LIFE. WELL, IF THAT'S NOT A MIRACLE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. LYDIA, DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT JOSH CAMDEN CURED YOUR ARTHRITIS? OH, YES. YES, I DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LAKE THAT DAY. ALL I KNOW IS, I HAVEN'T HAD A TOUCH OF ARTHRITIS SINCE JOSH TOUCHED MY HANDS, AND I'D CALL THAT A MIRACLE. [TYNAN]: I SPOKE NEXT TO LUTHER FROEBLER, WHO CLAIMED THAT JOSH CAMDEN HAD HEALED HIS DOG-- HEY, THERE'S LUTHER! [EVERYONE CHEERING] ...IT SEEMED HIGHLY IMPROBABLE, BUT IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS, I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE. AND THERE'S TOBY! WOW, UH, LUTHER, CAN YOU MAKE HIM RUN? [LUTHER]: YES, MA'AM. TOBY, LOOK WHAT I GOT FOR YOU. GO GET IT, TOBY! SEE? ALL HEALED. AW, HE STILL LOOKS LIKE HE'S LIMPING TO ME. [TYNAN]: ...HOWEVER TO THIS REPORTER'S EYES, MR. FROEBLER'S DOG EXHIBITED A VERY STRONG LIMP, AND SEEMED ANYTHING BUT CURED. AMONGST THE CRITICISM OF WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED HERE IN BETHANY ARE HIGHLY RESPECTED SCIENTISTS,AND DOCTORS EVEN RELIGIOUS LEADERS. DOES THEIR SKEPTICISM CONCERN YOU? [SARAH]: YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE RELIGIOUS OR MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WHOLE ISSUE. YOU KNOW, I'M HIS MOTHER. BUT LUKE'S COMING BACK TO LIFE, WELL, TO ME, AT LEAST... [SIGHS] IT WAS A MIRACLE. [TYNAN]: BUT NOT EVERYBODY BELIEVES IT WAS A MIRACLE. WE SPOKE WITH DR. PETER NAKATOMI, HEAD OF THE CHEVELDAVE RESEARCH INSTITUTE. DR. NAKATOMI, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BELIEVE THIS STORY. WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO BELIEVE AND WHAT WE CAN VERIFY AS MEDICAL FACT. [TYNAN]: SO, UH, DIFFERENTIATION-- WHAT'S THIS? FOCUS POINT. THEY'RE DOING A SHOW ON MRS. CAMDEN'S SON. I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT LIKE TO WATCH. YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO HEAR IT, KAREN. YOU NEVER KNOW. I SUPPOSE. ...SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT HE SHOWED NO VITAL SIGNS FOR OVER AN HOUR? IT'S A PHENOMENON WE CALL THE MAMMALIAN DIVING REFLEX. IT'S RARE, BUT THERE ARE OTHER, SIMILAR CASES IN MEDICAL LITERATURE. WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING IT FURTHER? WHEN THE CONDITIONS ARE EXACTLY RIGHT, AS THEY WERE IN THIS CASE, IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE HUMAN BODY TO GO INTO A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION, MUCH THE SAME IDEA AS A COMPUTER GOING TO SLEEP. NO OUTWARD SIGNS OF LIFE, BUT THE BODY IS STILL FUNCTIONING ON A BARELY DETECTABLE LEVEL. THAT'S FASCINATING. NOW, ONCE THE BODY TEMPERATURE IS RESTORED TO A NEAR NORMAL STATE, THE BRAIN REACTIVATES THE VITAL FUNCTIONS, AND THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT OCCURRED IN THIS CASE. THE DATA SUPPORTS THIS. [TYNAN]: SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS, THIS WAS NOT A MIRACLE. NO, IT MOST CERTAINLY WAS NOT A MIRACLE. WE SPOKE WITH MR. CAMDEN AT HIS HOME, A DECOMMISSIONED METHODIST CHURCH. SO YOU NEVER CLAIMED TO BE A NEW MESSIAH? GET OUT OF HERE. WELL, WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE INTERVIEW. YES. YES, WE HAVE. DO YOU FEEL PERSECUTED? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY? DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT I'M THE RISEN LORD? THAT I-I WALK ON WATER TO AMUSE MY FRIENDS? I CALM STORMS, OR I TURN WATER INTO WINE BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN SHOPPING AT WALMART? IS-IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? [TYNAN]: IS THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE? JOSH WOULD NEVER SAY THAT. [HEART MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY] --WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE INTERVIEW. [JOSH, SHOUTING]: WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT FROM ME? DON'T INSULT ME. I AM A SOUNDBITE TO YOU. GET OUT! I WANT YOU OUT. GET OUT. LISTEN, OKAY? LET'S JUST ALL CALM DOWN. GET OUT. MR. CAMDEN REFUSED TO CONTINUE THE INTERVIEW, AND-- SHE'S FLATLINING. IT'S A CODE BLUE. COME ON, HELEN. [TRIGGERS ALARM] GOT IT. --YOU DECIDE. DELIA TYNAN, FOCUS POINT, NEW YORK. [TURNS OFF TV] SO... DID I DIE OR NOT? MOM? WHAT? DID I DIE OR NOT? [SIGHS] APPARENTLY NOT. THANK GOD. MIRACLE OR NO MIRACLE, YOU DIDN'T. SO, I GUESS WE WON'T BE FAMOUS ANYMORE. [CHUCKLES] I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BEING FAMOUS IN THIS LIFETIME. ME TOO. I'M TIRED OF BEING THE AMAZING UNDEAD KID. [LAUGHS] BUT WHY DID THEY MAKE HIM LOOK CRAZY? HE'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BECAUSE IT MAKES A BETTER STORY, EVEN IF IT ISN'T TRUE. [♪♪♪] [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] SORRY, MOM. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD TURN OUT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. RIDICULOUS. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, GIVING THAT INTERVIEW? [BED HYDRAULICS WHIRRING] MOM? WHO DO YOU THINK I AM, A GHOST? BUT THIS-THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE. ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR MIRACLES, I GUESS. [GROANS] WHERE ARE MY GLASSES? REALLY? OF COURSE NOT. DIDN'T YOU WATCH THE SHOW? IT'S BEEN PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED THAT YOU'RE NO MIRACLE WORKER. THAT'S TRUE. I'M STARVING. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE FOOD AROUND HERE? I'D KILL FOR A STEAK. NO... A PIZZA, LARGE. WITH PEPPERONI. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET HER A PIZZA. BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THE OVERNIGHTS? WE HAVEN'T SEEN RATINGS LIKE THIS SINCE THE SEXTUPLETS SHOW, NOT EVEN CLOSE. OKAY, WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT? WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WHAT? ONE VERY IMPORTANT VIEWER DIDN'T CARE FOR THE SHOW SO MUCH. THE CHAIRMAN'S WIFE. THE CHAIRMAN'S WIFE, OKAY. SHE HATED IT. WHAT? WHY? [SIGHS] THE SHORT VERSION IS MRS. CHAIRMAN IS APPARENTLY QUITE RELIGIOUS. WHO KNEW? SO? WELL, SHE THOUGHT THE CARPENTER'S MIRACLE SEGMENT WAS MAKING FUN OF RELIGION. IT WASN'T. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NO, I TOLD THE CHAIRMAN, BUT IT SEEMS HE WAS TAKING A LOT OF ABUSE FROM MRS. CHAIRMAN. I'LL HAVE A SPICY CHEESE TERIMAYO, PLEASE. SO, YOUR JOB IS SECURE? YES. BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES WITHIN THE SHOW. YEAH. I'M PUTTING YOU ON THE CELEBRITY BEAT. COME ON. JUST FOR A WHILE. AND IF I DON'T AGREE? THAT WOULD BE VERY UNWISE. JACK, COME ON, I'M A JOURNALIST, I'M NOT A GOSSIP-MONGER. I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT THE CHAIRMAN WAS ADAMANT. I-I UNDERSTAND IF YOU... IF YOU DON'T WANT... NO, THAT'S NOT GOOD. [REHEARSING AND STAMMERING] ...I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME. I JUST... I-I WANT-- SO, ARE YOU COMING IN OR NOT? I HAVEN'T MADE MY MIND UP YET. I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD. WELL, I... I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO SEE ME. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. [MUTTERING] OKAY... HI. HI. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME-- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE WHOLE INTERVIEW MESS, THAT-THAT WAS MY FAULT. NO, IT WASN'T YOUR-- AND WE LOOKED LIKE IDIOTS-- NO, YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT. POINT TAKEN, I LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT, AND I-I UNDERSTAND IF YOU MIGHT BE MAD AT ME. ONLY MILDLY-- [STAMMERING AWKWARDLY, TALKING OVER EACH OTHER] MAD WOULD JUST BE AN OVER-EXAGGERATION-- YOU KNOW WHAT, FORGET ABOUT "MAY" BE MAD AT ME. IF YOU WERE REALLY DEEPLY ANGRY WITH ME, I WOULD GET THAT, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME OR TALK TO ME AGAIN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'D UNDERSTAND, I WOULD. WELL, YOU ARE THE MOST UNPOPULAR MAN IN AMERICA AT THE MOMENT. [CHUCKLES] YOU KNOW, A FAKE MESSIAH. ONLY THING LOWER WOULD BE AN IRS AGENT, OR-- I'M SORRY I GOT YOU INVOLVED. I'M SORRY. BECAUSE I... I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. I WANT TO-- I WANT TO TELL YOU THINGS. IS THERE ANY WAY THAT I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU? YEAH. YOU CAN BUY ME DINNER. I'M STARVING. OKAY. OKAY. [CHUCKLES] LUKE. UH... WE WERE JUST, UM, TALKING ABOUT GETTING SOME DINNER, AND, UM, SOME PIZZA. DO YOU WANT TO GET SOME PIZZA WITH US? IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, MAN. I'VE GOT SOME HOMEWORK, AND I THINK I'D RATHER HANG HERE. BUT, UM, YOU TWO CAN GO. OKAY. WE'LL BRING YOU BACK A SLICE. THAT'D BE GREAT. COME ON. OKAY. I'LL GET MY RAINCOAT. GET YOUR RAINCOAT. SO, WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW? I DON'T KNOW. THE LAST FEW DAYS REALLY SHOT MY FAITH-HEALING BUSINESS TO PIECES. NO, SERIOUSLY. WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE? SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW. TO YOU? TO YOU AND LUKE? IF YOU'LL HAVE ME. OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S... NO GOING BACK TO THE LIFE THAT YOU'VE LED. THAT I'VE LED. EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO, YOU COULDN'T GO BACK TO THAT LIFE. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK, I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. I WANT TO CONTINUE FORWARD. WITH YOU. [TIRES SQUEALING] [CRUNCH, DOG YELPS] WHAT? WHAT WAS THAT? OH, NO, I THINK I HIT SOMETHING. OH, NO, NO, I KNOW THAT DOG. THAT'S... THAT'S TOBY. THAT'S LUTHER'S DOG, TOBY. OH, MAN... OH, NO. NO, I... AW, POOR LITTLE GUY. HE'S DEAD. [SIGHS] WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? [SIGHS WELL, WE'VE GOT TO TELL HIM. WE'VE GOT TO... TAKE HIM TO LUTHER. I'M SORRY, TOBY. [TOBY WHINES] [BARKS] [RUNS OFF, BARKING] [WHINES] [BARKING EXCITEDLY] OKAY, HE WAS DEAD. LET'S NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS, OKAY? WELL, I CAN-- NO, NO, NO, PLEASE. NOBODY. OKAY. [♪♪♪]
