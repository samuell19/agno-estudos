Dad... are you okay? Come on, let's hurry up and go. Close the door behind you, please. Oh, we're always late. Ah. Hey! You comin' to church with the rest of us holy people? No, I got too much to get to today. Yeah, your daughter said the same thing. Suit yourselves. Maybe we should stay and help you, Dad. Nah, you boys go on with Sadie. Nice try. Come on. Gotta get there in a hurry. I saw you ridin' back to the barn with her last night. Thought that wasn't gonna happen no more. It's not. All right. You can let her out now. I'm gonna ride you, Belle! Where did you go off to so early this morning that you had to miss service, huh? North pasture. I found a cedar that would make a nice Christmas tree if anyone wants to help me chop it down. Yeah? Yeah. It's Christmastime, Dad. There's this thing people do with decorations. Ellie... We're the only ones I know who don't have a... I don't think so. Not this year. Do you at least wanna know what I want for Christmas? I wanna ride Belle, like you promised. Ha. Don't look at me. You said when I turned 14. -I don't remember any such... -You did. You did, and I'm 14. Since when? November? We had a cake. You can't ride that crazy horse, Ellie. She's a couple beans shy of a good chili. Outta all the horses on this ranch, why you gotta ride that one? Because she needs to be ridden. Because Mama rode her and she'd want me to. No. You might look just like your mama, but she was the only one that could handle her. At least I thought she could. I don't trust that animal one bit. Nile is right, she's skittish and unpredictable. You could help me. No. Ellie, that horse is not fit to ride. Not at 14, not 15, not any age. That's all I'm gonna say about it. Ellie... Whoa. What do you aim to do with that? I dunno, hug it. Don't worry, I'm takin' it to the barn. Does she look different to you? I ain't trying to get in your business, Will, but... maybe celebrating Christmas would do everybody some good. Ain't the worst idea in the world, you know? What happened to not gettin' in my business, Eric? Well, sir, since I've worked this ranch with your granddad, your dad, and now you, I consider you and your kiddos my business. Come on, Will. Claire's been gone two years. If you don't do it for yourself, at least do it for them kids. Do you guys wanna help me bring the tree to the barn? And by the way, Dad can hear y'all playin', y'know? What? Your hair, what happened? Really? Oh, no. How do you like my hair now? I love it! It... it's beautiful! You're a thing of beauty. A beauty queen! Noah, help me! Aw, heck, no! Come on. Go. You happy? Merry Christmas, Mama. Come on in. William Brown? Yes, ma'am. I knew it. You just look a little different in person, is all. I'm Sarah White and this is my sister Lydia. I think our kids go to school together. Do they? Pleased to meet you, but would you excuse me? I have an appointment I've gotta get to. Oh, we haven't heard a thing from you in ages. You have such a pretty voice. I appreciate that. Could we snap a picture with you? Would you mind? I really gotta get on. I'm sorry. Would you ladies excuse me? I know he's gone through a rough patch, but that was downright rude. He don't look good, neither. Will, you don't really wanna subdivide and sell the land that's been in your family for over four generations, do you? 50 to 100 acre plots. That should give everybody some room. Will, come on, for pity sakes. You don't need to be doing this. You need to be out there writin' songs and making some money. If you want the deal, Ed, I'll give it to you. If not, I'll take my business and my land someplace else. You're gettin' sweeter and sweeter every day, aren't ya? All right. I'll start the paperwork. Bowl, bowl. Stew? -Is there a problem? -Ingredients. -What about 'em? -There's too many. Oh. Well, take out what you don't like and be thankful for the rest, okay? I'm gonna need you kids to help get things picked up around here on Saturday. May be having some people drop by next week. We were hoping to go... Fishin' on Saturday. Not till the work's done around here, you're not. We'll help ya, Dad. Who's comin' by? Just some folks wanna take a look at the place. And by the way, boys, don't ya think I can hear y'all playin' way up here at the house? Told ya. When you're supposed to be studying or doing your chores? There's somethin' I need to tell ya. -About Belle? Because I know I can... -I put her up for sale. Wait, what? -William... -That was Mom's horse. I know that, Noah. I bought it for her. You can't... you can't sell Mom's horse, Dad. I already did. Wiley Keller bought her. He's picking her up in a couple days. No! How could you do that? You said it yourself, Ellie Claire. She needs to be ridden. And nobody in this family's gonna ride her ever again. It's time for all of us to let her go. Dad, it wasn't Belle's fault! Maybe it was, Ellie. Ever think of that? That's got nothin' to do with it anyway! Dad, please... No. And don't cry, girl. It's not worth your tears. It's okay. Pass the salt, will you? Eat your food. Hey, girl. Looks like the Grinch is trying to give us all a lump of coal for Christmas. We can't let that happen. Do you understand? Whoa. Hold on, girl. Hold on. Hold on, girl. Whoa, whoa. Easy, Belle. Belle! Easy! Hey, little girl. How ya feelin'? Just a little sore is all. Dad, it wasn't Belle's fault. I dropped the reins. It's okay. What in the world were you thinkin'? I was thinking Mom would want me to have Belle. Not some stranger. There's more important things in life than a horse, Ellie. Not to me. She belongs to us. I can't take the thought of you riding her, and you know the reason. So why would you even ask that of me? 'Cause she's the only part of Mama I've got left. Hey, Noah. Check it out. Hey, Deb. You still got a thing for her? Yeah. She was all about me when Dad was still singin'. Won't even look at me now. She was just using you, Noah. Yeah. I miss that. See you, Ellie. Hey! Oh, that was a mistake. Can I help you? Yeah. You can tell me why your daddy's such a rude pot-licker. What? My daddy's not rude. Rude as can be. My mama said she saw him in town the other day, wanted a picture with him. And he just walked away. I'd say that's pretty rude. I'm sure he had better things to do. Look who's being rude now. Must run in the family. Mama said he looks real bad, too. Whatever. Like he'd been drinkin' or on drugs or somethin'. Says that's probably why he quit singin', you know, because he's all strung out on drugs. You talking about your better-than-everyone mama who's got horns holdin' up her halo? Why would William Brown wanna take a picture with that ugly hornet? What did you just say? Oh, I'm sorry. I take that back. She's not better than anyone. You okay? Doin' great. Can't you tell? Is Dad in there? Y'know, you don't gotta defend him all the time, Ellie. She in trouble? Suspended three days. The other girl, too. It just means a few extra days of Christmas break for 'em. I heard she had a few choice words to say about Sarah White. That should give this town some fat to chew on for a while. Yeah. Yeah, maybe, but that's the last thing we needed was for her to bring more attention to this family. There's only one person whose attention she's tryin' to get. What did you expect, William? You won't let her celebrate the season. You sold her mama's horse. You're about to sell this ranch, which is the only home she's ever known. And you... and you talk to her about a whole lot of nothin', you know? What do you want me to say, Sadie? Somethin', anything. I mean, you can start with that haircut. Yeah, yeah. All the talk in the world won't change a thing that's happened. Forgive me, son. It's one thing to grieve. But, mijo, you're wallowin' in it, and none of us know why. She lost Claire that day just as much as you did. As much as all of us. But we need to move on. Your children are changin', Will. And you are missing it. Wait! Please, stop! I didn't even get to say goodbye! Please, stop! Please, don't take her. Thank you. Now, girl, don't you even think about gettin' on this horse again till we figure out what we're gonna do. I won't, Dad. I promise. I think this job came at a good time for both of us. Lord knows he could use some time away from me. No, Ma, we didn't break up. I don't think. He just needs some space, is all. Yes, again. Look, it'll be fine. I'll be home in a few weeks. I'll be... yeah, I'll be back before Christmas. I promise. Okay. Okay, I will. I love you, too. Okay, bye. Would you look at this, Finn? We're not in the city anymore. This is it, Finn. Christmas Mill Ranch. Are you seein' this? Who would be crazy enough to let this place go? Hey, David, it's me. I'm not stalking you. I know what we said, but you know how you're always looking for great properties to show your clients? Well, there's a listing you need to see. Whoa! I'm not kidding. David, this might be the most beautiful place this side of heaven. So I just wanted to let you know. You can call me back or not. That's it, nothing more. Okay. Moving on. I mean, hanging up, bye. Idiot. Good morning. Mornin'. You here to see the property? I'm here to help a horse. But I wouldn't mind a tour sometime. Sure is a beautiful place you have here. I'm Sam. Sam Lin, from the horse training co-op out of Houston. You sure you're at the right place? A Ms. Eloise Brown set it up. That your wife? Please, come in, Ms. Lin. Finn, settle. Settle down. I can assure you, I'm much better with horses than I am with dogs. Let me get Eloise for you. Hey, Ellie. Would you mind comin' downstairs for a minute, please? This is my 14-year-old daughter, Ellie, Eloise. Ellie, this is Sam Lin, the horse trainer you apparently hired. Somethin' you forgot to tell me? You're Eloise? But everyone calls me Ellie. And I did tell you, Dad. On the couch? I said I found someone and you grunted. And then I said, "Do you want to follow up or do you want me to?" And you grunted again. So I e-mailed and set it up. Then I'm guessing you didn't tell him I'm scheduled to be here two weeks either? As in stay here? The whole time. Can't send her home after she's come all this way. I don't mind. Now, Will, I'm sure we can figure something out. Maybe we can set her up in the cabin. You'll be comfortable there. She ought to be able to at least look at that horse and make up her mind, see what she thinks. Fine. Couldn't hurt, I guess. I'm Will Brown. Have we met before? I don't believe so. You look so familiar. He is... was a country singer. Oh. Anything I'd recognize? "Tailgate Church Pew"? "Still Find You"? Sorry, the only thing I know about country music is it's songs about girls, pickup trucks, and cold beer. Well, that depends on who's singin'. These are my boys, Nile and Noah. This here's Eric and Sadie Shepherd. Oh. You've met Finn. Hope you don't mind, he goes everywhere with me. What are we all standin' here for? Let's get you unloaded and set up in the cabin. -Yes, ma'am. -Hey. You got some apologizing to do, Ellie Claire. Sorry. Not to me. I don't even know this woman. I mean, is she even any good? Her reviews were great. She was a world-class barrel racer when she was my age, so I think she knows what she's doin'. You already said yes anyways. What choice did I have? That was an ambush up there. You let me do all the talkin'. I don't want a total stranger knowin' all of our business. And I don't grunt! Okay. It's open. Whoa. Looks like those two are becoming fast friends. Looks like it. Ms. Lin, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward situation. No harm done. I'm glad it got worked out. And you can call me Sam. I was just admiring the cabin. Looks like the exterior was made out of local red-heart cedar. It was. You have good eyes. Thanks. I mean... I mean, you have a good eye. My grandfather built it from timber and limestone he found right here on this property. I saw you've got it up for sale. Yeah, times change. Look, I appreciate you comin' so close to the holiday. I hope it's not too much of a hardship. No, not at all. As it turns out, it's a good time for me to be away. Well, Ellie wants to ride that horse by Christmas. Well, Ellie, I can't promise miracles in a few weeks. It takes the time it takes. Figured. But I'd like to get some background on your horse before we get started. Belle's not my horse. She was my mama's. She passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. Is this her right here? Those two had some kind of connection. Belle was always spirited and... that's what Claire liked most about her. Does Belle get ridden at all? She was injured a couple years ago. And after she healed, we never rode her again. So she's been out to pasture, so to speak. Yeah, and over time she's become more unpredictable. And isolated. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go meet her. Come on. Let's go. I like to work with horses in their own environment to see if there are any issues here that might be contributing to the problem. The only problem here is the horse. I've been around horses my whole life. Trained a few of 'em, too. Why did Ellie call me? I hate to admit it, but I don't care much for the animal. I don't think I'd bring the right energy to the process. And why's that? There was an incident recently. Ellie went to mount Belle, she dropped the reins. They got tangled around her hooves. Horse panicked and threw Ellie into the fence. Ellie, that must've scared you to death. But I'm super impressed you want to get back into the saddle. Thanks. Well, since you've been around horses all your life, you know as well as I do, we can't truly overcome a horse's natural instincts with training. Belle felt trapped, tried to escape what she perceived as a life-threatening situation. Well, that life-threatening situation could'a killed my daughter. And I can't have that, can I? No. But it does no good to blame the horse. I'm not blaming her. I just don't trust her. Will, you need to know, it's my belief that horses are innocent creatures, no matter what. And any behavior to the contrary is more likely fear than guile. Ellie. She's a beauty! I know, right? How old is she? Almost five. She looks strong and athletic. Dad says she has a mean streak. Nah. She might not be the easiest, tame, or most predictable horse right now, but just like human beings, the great ones usually aren't. She just needs a clear purpose to match that fiery spirit. So, we've got a lot of work to do. All of us. Including you. I'm only asking for an hour, twice a day. Think of training Belle as a long-term venture. Once I'm gone, you and Ellie will have to take over. Does that work for you? Do I have a choice? Not if you want this arrangement to work. Well, then, I guess it's whatever you say. Let's get started. Now? You want to ride her by Christmas, don't ya? You gonna train that horse with a little stick and string? I guess we'll find out in a few minutes. Hey, I'm gonna have you stay out here for the time being, okay? Let me get a reading first. You know I'm not a beginner. I know, but Belle is. She's having to learn things all over again. We need to have a healthy respect for what she could do to us. In the wild, a horse's survival depends on it trusting the herd leader. So now we're the leader and we need to gain her trust. How? She talks, we listen. She talks? In her own way. Then we get her to move. Horses chase each other around all the time. That's how they learn. When we get control of her feet, we gain her respect. And when we gain her respect, she'll start to trust us. And, Ellie, when we have her trust, there isn't anything we can't do. Thanks. Good girl, Belle. Easy, girl. You're safe. No one's gonna hurt you. See this, Elle? This is what we want. We want her to look at us. Pay attention to us. Good girl. That'll do for now. We'll meet back here tomorrow morning. She did good, right? She'll get there. But we've got a lot to do first. Her two instincts are fight or flight. She's definitely got some trauma issues. Some things we need to reprogram. Help her heal. We need to get her back to a good place. Good. Yeah. You wanna set spatial boundaries unless we invite her in closer. Good girl, Belle. Trust equals safety. With horses, there are no shortcuts. If you're confident, Belle will be confident. A horse will tend to mirror our emotions and they can read us like a book. I'm beat, so I know she is. Let's keep going. Leaving her alone is her reward. She's done good for us. Are these actual seashells? Yep. This whole place was once underwater. They're everywhere, if you know where to find them. I can take you sometime if you want. I'd like that. They're like little glimpses into the past. Mom used to love to go shellin'. It was one of our favorite things. Anybody ever tell you you're the spittin' image of your mother? Everybody. Before I chopped my hair off. You cut it yourself? Can't you tell? I did that once. My mom didn't speak to me for a week. My dad didn't even notice. Ellie, I'm sure he did. Well, I can tell you from experience, men don't notice half the things we want them to. Yeah. Just thought if I cut it, I wouldn't look so much like Mom, and he wouldn't get so depressed every time he looked at me. Have you talked to him about this? No. He's never in the mood to talk about Mom. But I want to. Well, you can talk to me anytime. And you know what else? I'm a pretty good barber. Want me to work some magic? Might save me from a fight or two. Let's go, then. Hey, missed you this mornin'. Yeah, well, I had a lot to get done today. How'd it go? It went good...with Belle. And Ellie? All right, I think. Yeah? Yeah. I don't wanna cross any lines, but can I level with you about something? I guess. Ellie doesn't think you notice her. She said that? Not in those exact words. But I think she's dealing with the loss of her mom and doesn't feel like she can talk to you about it. That couldn't be further from the truth. That's what she thinks. And you might want to ask her why she cut her hair. Look, I appreciate what you're tryin' to do here, but I hired a horse trainer, not a shrink. Wow. Okay. I, I just thought... And I don't need a total stranger tellin' me anything about me or my family. I just figured you'd like to know what was going on with your daughter. That's all. Guess I was wrong. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to the work I was hired for. And speaking of hair, you could use a trim. Wow. I believe so. Yeah. Hey there. Sam, can I have a word? Yeah, sure. How about you grab Belle, meet you in the ring. Y'know, a wise person once wrote that people are always trying to make horses into something they're not. What, did you Google me? And that a horse only knows how to be a horse and they don't think like people do. She sounds brilliant. According to her, they don't have the same ego and pride as humans and they're more forgiving. So, maybe in the future, I could be more like a horse and a little less like a horse's backside. That sounded like an ill-fated attempt at an apology, and if so, I accept. But only if you accept mine. You could be a white dove In a cotton field A summer breeze through a windmill Girl, it don't matter how close or how far Ain't nothing gonna keep us apart I thought you didn't know anything about country music. I can Google too, you know. Actually, I know that song. I got my first kiss to it, my first and my last. I'm not that old. This was just a week ago. I used to get a ton of kisses, but Finn's been a little stingy lately. I... I do appreciate you tellin' me about Ellie. I overreacted. How about we call it even? Even, it is. So? It looks way better. Not half bad. Not half good either. Man, Nile, you do have a way with words, don't ya? What do ya think? Looks real good, El. How 'bout you? You ready for that trim? Come on, Dad. You got somethin' against barbers? Sit on down. I used to cut hair in college for some extra side money. And I'd cut my brother's hair, so just to keep up my chops... Get it? Chops? I gotta go. I'm not... I'm not finished. Where'd he go so fast? I guess he doesn't like haircuts. Guess not. Hey. Remember the first day you got here, you mentioned you wouldn't mind taking a tour of the place? I remember. I'm ready to be your tour guide, if you're interested. Thought you'd never ask. So, what got you into training horses? Well, first off, I love everything about them. Turning fear into trust, timidness into confidence. They're honest and straightforward. It's people that trip me up. Yeah, lately, I'm not so good with either. This is beautiful country. You ain't seen nothin' yet. This land... It's more than just land. This is our life. My great granddad homesteaded this ranch. So, I've gotta ask. Why in the world are you selling it? That's a long story. But the short version is, I have to. This ranch doesn't run itself. It's gotta hurt. If by hurt, you mean losing a piece of yourself one acre at time... yeah, it hurts. Couldn't you just... you know, write a song? Do you remember that song, "The Day the Music Died"? When you lost your wife? I lost my will. After Claire passed, nothing seemed much important after that. How about you? You married? In a relationship? Yeah, I'm in a relationship. Or I was, I am... I don't even know. We're taking a little break. A break, huh? He's a really great guy. You would like him. Everybody does. We're just very different people. They do say opposites attract. We're living proof of that. He just needs some time to figure things out. Figure out what he wants in life. What do you want, Sam? I want him. But it's beginning to feel like he wants something else. It's hard to let go, ya know. Yeah. Yeah. That I know. It's getting dark, we better head back. Hey, look there. Is she...? Dead? No. But she won't last long out here. It's tough when a heifer calves in winter. She's ice-cold. Eric's the best calfer around. If anyone can save her, he can. Thanks. Well, if she ain't too sick, she ought to come around after a couple days of tube feeding. And the quicker we can get her on a bottle, be a lot better for her. All you can do is keep her warm tonight. And I'll check on her in the morning. Thanks, Eric. We'll take it from here. Mighty fine. I can hunker down with her, if you wanna get some shut-eye. I'll stay here and keep you company if you don't mind. Sam... the other day when you asked me why I wasn't a fan of Belle... Yeah? Claire was riding her the night she died. Will, I'm so sorry. From what we could tell, a storm kicked up while she was riding on the south ridge. The grounds were wet from the rains a week before, and the dirt just gave way, sending her and Belle some 50 feet down the ravine. Somehow Belle made it out back to the barn. She was covered in mud, and... knee all tore up. But... by the time we found Claire... Think they have a thing goin'? Sam and... No way. He's too ugly. Maybe she's into ugly guys. Doing good, Belle. Whaddya think they were doin' in the barn all night? What do you think, Noah? Playin' spin the bottle? Eric was out there, too. How romantic could it be? Besides, it will never work out. Why not? Because Sam's not Mom. Good girl. So, maybe she's just what he needs. Nah, I don't see it. But ya gotta admit, Dad's been way better since she's been here. Yeah, I guess. And she is a fan of our music. Our biggest fan. Noah, she's our only fan. What are you thinking about? I was thinkin' this is the first time we've had dinner out here since Claire passed. It was nice. It was. My dad always said there are some things in this world that words can't get to. And this place certainly qualifies. That sounds like the beginning of a country song to me. It's a gift. Maybe you're in the wrong business. What? Nothin'. You need to take that? No, I'm good. Okay. Night, Will. Good night. Like holey knees in Levi's Or my favorite pair of boots Granddaddy's rusted 12 gauge I still love the way it shoots Like a muscadine bottle of wine This heart of mine gets better with time Don't it? It ain't broken It's just broke in Hear that? He's still got it. Like holey knees in Levi's Well, I'll be. Or my favorite pair of boots Eric, listen. Granddaddy's rusted 12 gauge I still love the way it shoots Like fallin' off a log. Like a muscadine bottle of wine This heart of mine gets better with time Don't it? It ain't broken It's just broke in It's just broke in Amazing Grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me I once was lost But now am found Was blind But now I see Amazing Grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me I once was lost -Thank you, sir. -There you are, young fella. -Hey. Good to see you. -Thank you so much. -Ellie, how are you? -Hi. -Enjoyed your sermon. -Eric, thank you. Always a pleasure. Sadie, it certainly was good seeing Ms. Ellie here today. You know, I sure do wish William would come on back. Me too. I'm afraid he's not quite ready to let God off the hook yet. Yeah. Okay. That looks like fun. It is. Dad used to sing at it when he first started. Did he? Sure did. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I wouldn't hold your breath. Will, good news. We got our first offer on two plots. Two hundred acres. And they're offerin' full price, buddy. Full price! Will, this is... this is good news. Okay. Aren't, aren't ya happy? Yeah, I'm happy. Happy my dad's not here to see this. Yeah. You're good. So are you. Did you know the world record for stone skipping is 88 skips? The fact that you know that is impressive. Strange but impressive. I heard you singing the other night. Yeah. It's been a while. I'm a little rusty. That did not sound like rust to me. I'll take that as a compliment. Do you? It made me want to give up rock for country music. I didn't hear a single reference to girls, pickup trucks or a cold beer. I told you, that depends on who's singin'. Read it. What would it take? It'd take you skipping that rock in your hand 89 times. I don't have the fight left. That's what you need in this industry. It isn't a life sentence. It's just one gig. That's all. My band's all moved on. I know a couple of local boys you could use. Lemme guess. Thanks. Yeah. Good job. You did real good, El. Are we ready? Ask her. You mean, ready for the saddle? More than ready. Both of you! Just you and me dancin' To a Texas moonrise Tomorrow I'll be draggin' But you can't say nothin' good Ever happens after midnight Hey. -Thank you for doing this. -My pleasure. Oh, I did as you asked. All right. I didn't advertise. I didn't tell a soul you were comin'. I appreciate that. They are surely gonna be surprised. I can't wait to see their faces. -Ready to go? -We better be. I'll introduce you. Folks, have we got a big surprise for you tonight. Country singer Will Brown is with us here tonight. How'd you all like to hear him sing a few songs? Yeah! Me too! Will, come on! It's good to be here. You got me feelin' Top of the mountain, Mile High City Soakin' up the glow Of your small-town pretty Takin' in the sights, breathin' it in Takin' me places that I've never been Got them Gold Coast eyes, girl Bluer than the water And a farm-town boy Still wonderin' how he got her The Tennessee sun down on your skin You're takin' me places That I've never been I've never been I can go round and round This town all night Circle it forever while I hold you tight The first-time feelin', girl, it don't end Keep takin' me places that I've never been Takin' me places that I've never been I can tell you right now I don't really care if I ever see the purty little lights In Paris My picture-perfect worldwide view Is right here lookin' at you I can go round and round This town all night Circle it forever while I hold you tight The first-time feelin', girl, it don't end Keep takin' me places that I've never been Takin' me places that I've never been A half a karat diamond and a platinum band I hope you let me slip it Onto your left hand I never knew before what true love meant But you're takin' me places That I've never been I've never been, yeah I can go round and round This town all night Circle it forever while I hold you tight The first-time feelin', girl, it don't end Keep takin' me places that I've never been Takin' me places that I've never been We can go round and round This town all night We can go round and round This town all night Takin' me places that I've never been Thank you. All right. Yeah. Yeah! Thank you. Go, Dad! You did good, Dad. Come here. How was it? Just like fallin' off a log. A big log! How 'bout these boys? We were so proud. Yeah, I'm afraid I won't be able to afford 'em next time. That's how good they were. Did I look nervous? Not at all. Looked like you were in your glory. All of you. Well, it was a little of both. That's for sure. You kiddos mind if I dance with your daddy for a bit? No, ma'am. Suit yourself. Hey, Noah. Wanna dance later? I mean, only if you want. Yeah, sure. Cool. She's just using you again, Noah. I know. I can live with that. Are you happy about tonight? Does it show? You're hard to read sometimes. That was good. Real good. I mean, for the first time in a long time, I felt the music again. We all did. It felt like maybe I have something left to sing about. You know, you still have two good eyes. William Brown, did you just make a joke? Maybe I did. Excuse me. May I have this dance? David? Surprise. Who's that? Not sure, but it looks like she knows him. Ya think? Will, this is David. David Greer. David, this is Will Brown. Everyone knows who Will Brown is. What are you doing here? Well, I just came to see the most beautiful land this side of heaven. That's how Samantha described your ranch when she first saw it. And, Will, looks like we're gonna be your neighbors. I put an offer on 200 acres on the lower pasture. It's a beautiful place for sure. What are you talking about? Do you mind if I steal the lady from you? No, no. Not at all. You two have fun. I'm gonna go. What for? Who is that guy? You kids ride home with Eric and Sadie. I'll meet you back at the house later. David, what... what's going on? What do you mean, we're gonna be Will's neighbors? I've missed you. And when I couldn't reach you the last few days, I... Sam, you've always been there and when you weren't, I got scared. Dave, what are you getting at? I put an offer on Will's land because I want us to move here someday. We can settle down, you can raise your horses. Is she gonna show today? I dunno. We're so close. Yeah, well...things don't always go the way we plan sometimes. What happened last night? Was that her boyfriend? Ellie... Dad, what's going on? Do you want me to leave? I figured when you didn't show this mornin', that's what you were thinkin'. After last night, I assumed you'd want me to go. No. Not at all. And Ellie'll be disappointed if you did. I paid you through the week so you might as well stay if you want. Okay, I can finish out the week. Yeah. I wouldn't wanna disappoint Ellie. Will, I didn't go behind your back. I told him about the property before I knew you, before I knew what it meant to you. It was a surprise. -A gift. A... -A wedding gift? Yeah. He's smart. I'll give him that. You're a fine woman, Sam. You deserve to get everything you want from this life. Looks like it's all working out that way. And you're okay with that? We need the money, what does it matter who buys it? Might as well be you. Congratulations, Sam. Are you nervous? That's okay, but Belle is gonna pick up on your emotions... I don't know what I am. And forget about my emotions. What about Dad's? How can you play with his heart like that when you know how much he's been hurt already? That was not my intention, Ellie. Not at all. I never know what your dad is thinking or feeling. I mean, how can you tell with him? I can tell. It's written all over his face every time he looks at you. And at first I wasn't okay with that, because I didn't want to believe that anyone could take Mom's place. But the truth is he's better with you here, Sam. He's happier. Ellie, I don't know what it is you're seeing on your dad's face, but I do know this, he adored your mother. Still does. And no one can ever take her place. No one. Don't worry, you've got this. I'll get her warmed up for you, then I'll hand you the reins, okay? Okay. Good girl. I think she's ready for you. Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay. What's wrong, girl? Belle, whoa. Whoa, Belle. Easy. Whoa. It's okay. It's okay. Nope. You're not getting on that horse. Not today. Are you kidding me? She'll settle down. No, Ellie, I agree with your dad. Now y'all agree on something! Hey! Ellie Claire! Ellie! I know you're disappointed. This isn't about me riding Belle. It's about you! Yeah, it probably is about me. I don't want you to get hurt again. Why can't you understand that? Because you're the one that got thrown off and is afraid to get back on again. You're afraid of me riding. You're afraid of singing. Of the boys following after you. Of falling in love again. Well, is she gone? Not yet. Son, I know you didn't ask, but I'm gonna say it anyway. You got to let one of 'em go. You got to. And since Claire's not with us no more, it might oughta be her. Everybody keeps telling me that, Eric. But I'm not sure I know how. Well, I sure hope you figure it out before it's too late. Hey. Hey. Looks like you're heading out. Yup. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow, so I got to head back. Sorry, things didn't turn out exactly as planned. Wasn't your fault. Good ole Texas weather. So I guess we'll be seeing you around from time to time, now that we'll be neighbors and all. I don't know. Maybe I don't wanna be your neighbor. What does that mean? Maybe it's wrong to let this majestic piece of land slip away when you could be using your God-given talent to keep it. And maybe I don't wanna have to see you every day. You think I wanna see you every day? Riding your horse on my back pasture with a man who took his sweet time deciding if you were what he wanted outta life? That's not what it was. You sure about that? Says the man who keeps taking moonlight rides with a wife who's been gone for over two years. I'm sorry. That was just... that was... True. It's true. I guess Ellie told you. She's just worried about you, is all. I was out of line to say anything. What? Will, talk to me. Please. Is that it? That's how we're gonna leave it? You asked me once what I wanted. What do you want, Will? Okay, then. Will, please tell Ellie I said I'm sorry she didn't get to ride Belle before Christmas. I'll tell her. Sam! Thank you. Thank you for everything. Don't go. Not tonight. Please! She's not out there, Dad. Come on! Easy. Come on. Come on. Easy. Belle, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on, Belle. What is it, girl? What happened? Easy, girl. Easy. Take me to the road. Take me there. Dad! Are you okay? I couldn't find her, Ellie. I wasted a big full moon that night, thinkin' there'd be another. There will be. I called her from the show that night, told her I'd be right home, we'd take our moonlight ride. But I didn't go home. I stayed, caught up in the moment. I traded some cheap applause for your mama's life. No, Dad. I can never forgive myself for that. You didn't do anything wrong. Why did she take that ride, Ellie? If I had been there, maybe she'd still be here. But she's not here, Dad, and neither are you. I lost you too that night. And so did the boys. You left us when we needed you the most, and for the last two years we've been bearin' this alone, and we can't do it anymore. We need you to come back to us. What you're lookin' for is not out there on that mountain. Oh, Ellie, I'm so sorry. Do you think you could ever forgive me? I do forgive you. You've got to forgive you. I'm so tired, El. I've blamed myself, blamed Belle, and God forgive me, blamed Claire for so long. But I've got to be better than that. I've got so much to live for, so much to be thankful to God for. You, the boys... Sam? How can I even think about movin' on when your mama can't? She has moved on, Dad, and she'd want us to do the same. I want that. I do, too. More than anything. It's okay if we cry. It's okay if we cry. I wish Mom was here to see this. She sees it, Noah, she sees it. It's okay, girl. No one's gonna hurt you. It wasn't your fault, and maybe it wasn't mine either. I've carried this around the past two years. What is it? A present I found under the Christmas tree that night from your mama. Haven't had the courage to open it. Maybe you can open it for me. A nautilus. There's something written on it. Forever forward. Do you want me to read it? Her handwriting. "My dearest Will. Years of digging up fossil shells on our ranch, I have never come across a nautilus. Not until today. This is a unique and rare find, just like you, my love." Just like you, my love. The nautilus is a symbol of strength and beauty. Its spiral shape is really a series of chambers, where it lives for a time before adding a new space for the next stage of life. No room to ever go back, only forward. This wonderful creature reminds me of you, Will, strong, resilient, and continually growing. I'm so proud of you and what you've accomplished. Keep this shell as an ever-present reminder to continue on the path God laid out before you. Always growing. Forever forward. All my love and Merry Christmas, Claire. What? Forever forward. Our stories like tattoos Like a scar on our heart It's still a part of you For so long, I was ashamed of mine But I don't have to move on I write it down in the words of a new song Like silver or gold heated by a fire Yeah, I'm better and better with time For every fallin' star For every broken heart For every minute That I'm in it and I fall apart Breathin' the next breath Don't listen to regret My story's not finished And I'm not done yet I can build up a wall And try to shut it out It's just a matter of time Before it falls down All out of order It's just brick and mortar I've gotta keep movin' forever forward The journey down life's road So many curves and swerves And broken potholes But there's beauty in takin' the long way Yeah, I've seen it enough to say For every fallin' star For every broken heart For every minute That I'm in it and I fall apart Breathin' the next breath Don't listen to regret My story's not finished And I'm not done yet I can build up a wall And try to shut it out It's just a matter of time Before it falls down All out of order It's just brick and mortar I gotta keep movin' forever forward No, the past don't define me It refines me The smiles and the tears Put the life in the years And now I finally see For every fallin' star For every broken heart For every minute That you're in it and it falls apart Breathin' the next breath Don't listen to regret Your story's not finished And you're not done yet I can build up a wall And try to shut it out It's just a matter of time Before it falls down All out of order It's just brick and mortar I gotta keep movin' forever forward So keep on movin' Forever forward Forever forward You guys are getting good at this. Hey, I'll be right back. You came. Will, I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't respond to your calls or texts. E-mails, faxes, smoke signals. I had a lot to figure out, and it's taken me a bit. I can understand that. Too well, I'm afraid. Will, that song, it was beautiful. I had some good inspiration. We neighbors now? Not yet. You didn't sign? There was a problem with the language. How so? How could I enter a binding contract with someone when I'm in love with someone else? Who is he? William Brown, did you just make another joke? Maybe I did.
