I went through the experience.. ...about four years ago. I was with my college friends. We were there for the Community Service Program. But... The village that we chose... ...wasn't an ordinary village. What we were thinking about was how to make... ...our Community Service Program work. But it turned out... ...everything that happened next... ...wasn't what we had imagined. At that time... ...the deceased had asked me to come. To do a survey. City B……. Nur. What are you looking at? Nothing. Come on./ Yeah. Do you think it can? The car can't get through the bridge. Let's go, sir. Come on./ Let's go. The ground is slippery after the rain. We're here./ Right. We'll get off here. Please./ Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir./ You're welcome. District of K…..li.. Yeah, thank you, sir. Excuse me. How are you? How are you?/ Good. Good. Yes, bro. This is my younger sister, Ayu. I'm Prabu./ Ayu. And this is her friend. Nur./ Right. Mr. Prabu is the village head. He will be the supervisor... ...of your community service activities. Okay. Keep Mas Prabu's trust. Okay? Don't make trouble. Yes, Brother. Let's talk about this in my house. Come on. Come on. Nur? What's wrong?/ Nothing. Bro. Why not, bro? Poor Ayu. She and her friends need to do... ...their community service activity here. Please help her. I beg you, sir. We have come from so far away. We intend to contribute something good... ...for the local people. Please consider it, sir. This is the first time for us as well. No one has ever asked... ...to do the community service activity here. That's why we can try it, right, sir? We will not be a burden. Our project will help the people. Whatever the problem is in this village... ...we will try to solve it. We want to help the villagers. This activity will benefit the community. Will you allow us, sir? Ms. Ayu. Ms. Nur... I am going to show you a location... ...which could be suitable... ...for your program. Thank you, sir. This place used to be... ...the bathing place for the dancers. But... ...they don't exist anymore. There are no dancers in this village now. And then... ...it was used as... ...a source of water for our village. But in the last few years... ...the water has dried up. So, the villagers... ...have some difficulty getting water. Because the river... ...is quite far from here. We can make a stream and a small dam. We can help, sir. We will make a plan... ...to channel the water to this place. Well... Please do your best. Okay?/ Okay, Sir. As long as the villagers get the benefit. And I hope this place... ...if it's possible, can be used again. Yes, Sir. Thank you for giving us this opportunity. Okay. Thanks, Brother./ Okay. Brother, take care of my sister, okay? Isn't there any other place? Why do you have to go to that place? I've told you, Mom. Ayu thinks the place is suitable for the program. That place is only forest area, my daughter. It's not the right place for people to stay. Nur and Ayu have checked out the place. The village head has given his permission. He is an acquaintance of Ayu's brother. I just don't want anything to happen to my only child. Mom... I will be with Nur and my other friends. So, you don't need to worry. Give me your blessing, please... ...for me to go for the Community Service. Mom... Okay, then. Take care of yourself. Mind your manners. Mind your words. There's a Javanese saying... The water always flows to the east. In the east, everything gathers. From the good things... ...the bad things... ...to the worst. Ouch... I have a flat bottom from sitting for too long. Nur. Is it alright? Is it still far away? About half an hour away. Alright. Might as well go to Bali. Come on, let's go. Keep your spirit up! Ayu... Are we walking? Damn it, are we riding on motorcycles? You want to walk instead? Sir./ Please. Sir. Thank you, sir. Mr. Prabu./ Miss Ayu./ How are you, Sir? These are my Community Service group members. Oh, right. I'm Bima./ Okay. Guys, this is Mr. Prabu. He's the village head here. Is this everyone?/ Yes, Sir. Come. Follow me./ Come on. Come on. Our village is a little behind. We don't have electricity yet. But I hope all of you can adapt. No worries, Sir. I'm used to it. Here there's no electricity. Where I live, Electricity is cut often because we don't pay the bills. Relax, Sir. The houses here... ...don't have bathrooms. So, if you want to take a bath... ...the boys can go to the river. And the girls... ...can use the one bathroom stall at your work site. What if we need to poop? Poop? The river isn't that close from here... ...so what we do in order to poop is... ...we dig a hole in the ground./ Crap. That I'm not used to. Excuse me, Sir. On the way here, I heard the sound of gamelan. Is there another village nearby? Gamelan? Yes, Sir. It sounded like a traditional ceremony. When did you hear it? On the way here. You must have misheard. Pay no attention to it. Okay? Now let me take you to where you'll be staying. Okay, Sir. Okay, Sir. Ma'am? Boys. Girls. This is Mrs. Sundari. For now... ...the girls will stay at Mrs. Sundari's house. The boys... ...will stay next door until a bigger place is ready. You'll move there later. Okay?/ Okay, Sir. Ma'am. I'll leave the girls to you. I can't say no, can I? Let's go, boys. I'll take you next door. Excuse me, Ma'am/ Yes. Thanks, Bima. I'll be going, Ma'am. Thank you, Bima. Come in. Widya. Why did you say that you heard the sound of gamelan? Did you not hear it? Think before you speak. We literally just got here, don't start with strange questions. I gave my word that we will behave well. That's why he gave his permission for our program here. If anything happens, I'll be the one taking the blame. Ma'am. Almost all of the houses here... ...are made of woven bamboo. So, we can hear... ...everything that you say... ...and see anything you wear. Nur, you heard it, didn't you? I'm going to bed. I'm sleepy. Can't you hold it? Are you really going to dig a hole? Help me, Ton. I've held it since yesterday. My stomach doesn't feel good. It's going to come out soon. There. Dig, Ton./ What? I'm only accompanying you, why should I dig? Ungrateful. You will go to heaven. Hurry, dig./ Rubbish. You dig. I'll hold the light. Damn you! Shit! It's a fresh one! Disgusting. How unlucky you are. Ton, what's wrong with him? He's scared he still has some left on his butt. Morning. Morning. How fragrant! Are you wearing perfume, Bim? Not me, it's Wahyu. So people think he has bathed. So he doesn't smell bad. Damn you. Widya... ...have you taken a bath? Widya would still be beautiful without a bath. Just like the meaning of my name? Beautiful? Good morning, boys. Good morning, girls. Good morning, Sir. I thought I'd be the only one who smells good this morning. You smell better. Have you taken a bath? I have, Mr. Prabu. I have been smelly, I mean. You're funny. Come on, let's go around the village again. Okay./ Let's go. Ton, come on. Is this our main program? That's right, Bim. Well... If your program succeeds... ...this "Sinden" would regain its function... ...as the source of water for our village. "Sinden", Sir? Yes. That's what we call this place. So, Miss Ayu... ...our villagers are ready to help. You just need to organize the groupings. Okay. Pardon me. What is that? Oh, that.../ Widya. The villagers remain respectful... ...of the traditions of our ancestors. That's one of our ways... ...to worship the universe... ...and its inhabitants. I thought it was for summoning the devil, Sir. Wahyu! There's no need to summon... ...when the devil is already standing in front of me here. I'm joking, Wahyu. Don't take it to heart. But you're accurate, Sir. He is the devil of our campus. Haunting the place for years. Don’t know when he will graduate. Okay. Come with me. Okay. Let's go, Bima. Watch your steps. Nur. What's wrong? Nothing. This is our burial ground. Even a dumb person would know that this is a graveyard. Wahyu. Watch your mouth. Excuse me, Sir. Why are some of the gravestones covered by black cloths? Nothing special. That just means they're... ...less than 10 years old. I see. Nothing else to be said about this graveyard. Nur! Are you okay? Miss... ...maybe you should go back. Yes, Sir. It's okay. I can take Nur. Bima, do you remember the way back? I do. Are you sure?/ I am. Be careful, Bima. Take rest, Nur./ Come on. Be careful. Let's go. Most of the villagers... ...plant corn. That's why every day... ...they spend most of their time here. Sir. Where does that go? That is the way towards the woods. That monument marks the boundary... ...between the village and the woods. Please... ...do not go near that monument. All of you cannot pass that boundary... ...and must stay away from the woods. Why's that, Sir? We call that area... ...Tapak Tilas. It's not our territory. Let's go. Nur? Are you feeling better? The others are out front. They're going to discuss the group assignment. Come on out. Okay. Have you been waiting long? It's okay, Nur. Come here. Let's split into groups for the smaller programs. The first group will be Widya and Wahyu. Second, Nur and Anton. Third, Bima and I. Why don't we just divide into two groups? Widya with us... ...Wahyu with Nur and Anton. No, Bima. More effective with just two people in one group. So we can have three separate groups for three different programs. Nur, aren't you going to take a bath? I don't want to. It’s a long walk. Come on. Doesn't your skin feel sticky? We haven't taken a bath since yesterday. You go. I'll do it tomorrow. I'm scared to go alone. Accompany me, please. Okay, then. But I will take a bath first. Okay. Have you noticed there isn't anybody our age here? Maybe their children have gone to the big cities. All of them? Not even one stayed? Excuse me. That's strange. Just walk. Do you need a shower kit? I don't. Nur. Don't take too long, okay? Okay. Widya? Widya! Widya! Widya. Widya, open the door! Forgive me, God... Forgive me, God... Forgive me, God... Forgive me, God... Forgive me, God... There is no deity but God... Forgive me, God... God, I ask for your protection from the cursed devils. Nur? You haven't started? Nur? Nur? What happened, Nur? You did not take a bath? Don't take too long, okay? Okay. Widya? Widya. Are you done?/ I am. Let's get out of here. Quick. Bima said... ...that he heard a voice from the monument. But when he went there to see where the voice came from... ...no one was there. Didn't Mr. Prabu tell us not to go there? Don't ask me. Nur. Does Bima have a girlfriend? So that's why it's just you and him in your group. Nur... Where are you going? I'm going to Mr. Prabu's house. There's something I want to ask him. Let me accompany you. You don't need to. Here's the coffee. For whom is the third cup of coffee? Miss Nur? Why have you come at this hour? Come in. Sit down. Here. Sorry to bother you, Sir. No worries. Excuse me. How can I help you? There's something I want to ask you. Yes. This is Mbah Buyut. He lives on the other side of the village. But he's an elder here. So please don't hesitate. You can ask me about anything. So... Ever since I arrived at this village... ...I feel there is something... ...strange. At first, I thought I was just seeing things... But... Drink the coffee. It's not polite to refuse the host. This coffee was prepared for you. Sorry, I don't drink coffee. Please, just drink it. Please. Is it sweet? What you saw... ...is a creature... ...that rules this place. He is one... ...of hundreds that inhabits the village. The village that not everyone can see. He's angry... ...because of what you brought to this village. What did I bring? She doesn't know... ...that you've been looking after her all this time? Miss Nur. He has promised... ...to not bother you anymore. Don't worry. These students are my responsibility. Nur? Nur! Widya. Widya... Widya. Widya. Nur? Nur! Nur! Nur, what are you doing? Snap out of it, Nur! Snap out of it! Nur, please! Nur, snap out of it! Nur! Nur, snap out of it! Hey. What are you doing, Bima? Hey! Why the hell are you dancing at this hour? Hey, Widya! Why the hell are you dancing? Widya, hey! Why the hell are you dancing? Hei! Hey! Ayu. Widya! Get up. Widya, hey! Widya! Widya. Widya, hey! What is wrong with you? Hey! Who the hell dances this late at night? Widya! Hey. That's enough. Get inside. What are you doing out here? It's like she's possessed. Come on. Are we... ...going to discuss what happened last night? You think Mr. Prabu didn't hear about yesterday? I've told you... Don't do anything weird. Ayu, you're with Wahyu. Wid, you're with me. Let's go. Come on. Ready?/ Ready. Let's go, Wahyu. Ladies first. Is this coffee or herbal medicine? It's so bitter. Don't just stare at your coffee. Come on. Drink it. I'm sorry, Mbah. I don't drink coffee. My stomach can't take it. Just one sip. Drink it. You are... ...warm blooded. Someone like you... ...is well liked by them. This... ...might help to keep them away. You can stop worrying now. Why did only Widya get it? You want it?/ Of course. Finish the coffee first. Forget about it. I don't want it anymore. Thank you. Ayu, help me. Okay. Sir. Why did the coffee taste sweet only to me? That black coffee... ...is usually used as an offering to our ancestors. Spirits love that coffee. To them, the coffee tastes sweet. I've had that coffee a few times... ...it's always bitter. Maybe... ...something is following you... ...and is interested in you. But you don't need to worry. Okay? Mbah Buyut is here to help. Well... Now... ...you go home. If anything happens... ...you tell me. Okay? Okay. Let's go, then. Nur, Bima has been acting really strange lately. Strange how? How do I explain it? I often hear Bima moaning at night. The weird thing is... ...I hear female moaning too from his room. You're talking nonsense, Anton. I'm serious, Nur! I didn't believe what I heard too at first. Until I found offerings in his room!/ Anton. I've been friends with Bima for a long time. I know what kind of person he is. That's impossible. Come with me. Hey, where are we going? See? Do you believe me now? Watch your steps. Please come in. Come in boys. Starting tonight... ...all of you will stay here. So you won't bother Mrs. Sundari anymore. Okay?/ Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. The boys' room is over there. And the girls' room is over there. Okay? Remember. Behave yourselves. Okay? Yes, Sir. Okay. Then I'll head home. Please rest. Thank you, Sir./ Okay. Night. Bima. I need to talk to you. Nur, we're going to look around. Come on. Don't forget to close your eyes when you’re going to sleep. Excuse me. Widya? What are you doing? What is it? Where are the boys? In their room. What is it, Widya? What's wrong? What's wrong, Widya?/ Calm down. Wait. Calm down./ What's wrong, Widya? Calm down. Sit down. Get some water, now! What's going on? Come on, Anton. Drink first, okay? Calm down. Calm down. Drink first, okay? Wid? Wid? Wid? Widya. Widya. Widya. Somebody's doing black magic on you! Widya. Drink this. How are you feeling? Better? What Anton said... It's impossible, isn't it? Don't think about it. You should rest. Okay? Sorry, Bima. I lost it. You lost it? How could you lose it? I asked you to give the "Bangle" to Widya. Sorry, Bim. I really forgot where I last put it. Why are you giving an old bracelet to Widya anyway? What's wrong with you? I trusted you with that. And now you lost it! I was wrong to trust you. You don't understand. What the hell is this? Mr. Prabu! There was a huge snake inside! But we can't find it now. Miss Ayu. Was there really a snake in the kitchen? I didn't see any snakes, Sir. But when I was in the kitchen, these men came barging inside. I swear, Sir! I saw a big snake there! Okay. Listen. Miss Nur and Miss Ayu. Let's talk at my house. In the past few days there have been a few incidents. Maybe it's best to end your community service program now. Sorry? We haven't finished our program yet. What happened earlier was just a misunderstanding. Miss Nur, you understand why I'm saying this, right? Nur. Nur! Why did you agree with Mr. Prabu? You're so selfish. I did that because I'm thinking about all of you. Just think about Widya. She's been fishing for attention from the start. What are you talking about? Yu! Yu... Nur and I... ...saw a snake in your friend's room. Gibberish. My friend? He's your friend. Baloney. Hey, do you realize it? Bima is getting stranger. That's what I'm talking about. I don't get it. Peace be upon you./ And upon you. What's up with her? Hey, Nur. What did Mr. Prabu say? Where are Widya and Bima? Widya's in the room. As for Bima, God knows where he is. He's probably busy with his program. Yeah right. Every time I pass by their work site, They are not there. God forbid they went to Tapak Tilas. Tapak Tilas?/ Yes, Tapak Tilas. He's misbehaving. The place is forbidden. Mr. Prabu has warned us. Anton. How much more time do we need to finish the Sinden program? Are you thinking of going home earlier? Would the campus let us? If they found out, we might not graduate. Nur, I'm going to the city tomorrow. To buy pipes. Do you want me to buy you anything? Yu, I'm coming with you. My head's spinning here. Oh, dear. Sorry, Anton, my dear friend. I've asked Widya to join me. I'd rather be with a pretty girl than you. But you ask for my company when you're pooping. That's because you look like shit. Poor guy. Peace be upon you, Bima. Where were you, Bima? Have you prayed today? It's been a while since I saw you pray. My spiritual life is my own business. Not yours. Mind your own business, Nur. Hey, Nur. Don't you want to ask about my spiritual life? Let's go. Ready?/ Yup. Nur. A lot of villagers aren't working today. Do you think Wahyu and Widya will come back late? Ton... Where is that Tapak Tilas you were talking about? Why are you asking? No reason. I just want to know. I was absent while you were going around the area with Mr. Prabu. Do you know there's a corn field there? Near that corn field, there's a gate. The gate is the border between the village and the woods. The area beyond the gate is called Tapak Tilas. But I don't get... ...what Tapak Tilas is. One thing is for sure, Mr. Prabu gave us a warning... ...not to go there. Why? You said it yourself. We have to respect the villagers' belief. Right? Nur? What are you both doing here together? Forgive me, Nur. We can explain everything. How do you think... ...your father would feel... ...if he knew what you were doing? Nur, please.../ Shut up! I'm not talking to you. Forgive me, God. Ask God for forgiveness, Bim. Ask God for forgiveness. It's as if you don't have a God. I don't know what to tell the others. Nur! Nur, please. Nur! Nur, please! You got the pipe?/ Got it. We got everything?/ Yes. How many?/ Six please. Okay. Mixed with chilli or separate? Separate, please. You don't look like you’re from around here. I knew it. So where are you staying? Far from here. Deep into the woods. A village called... Wait. Into the woods? Listen to me. I suggest... That you find lodging... ...to stay here for tonight. Don't go into the woods at night. Even the locals here... ...don't dare to go into the woods at this hour. Let alone you two who aren't from around here. Strange things might occur. What about it, Widya? Just kidding. I can't ask a good girl to spend the night. Unless she wants to, then I'm game 100% percent. It's fine. I'll drive really fast. All right. If you must go back tonight... ...go ahead. But remember this:... When you go into the woods... ...be careful. Don't let your thoughts be empty. Yes, Sir./ And always pray. If something weird occurs... ...just ignore it. Just keep going./ Yes, Sir. All right. What's the total? Fifteen thousand rupiah. Hey. Talk to me, Widya. So I know that you're still behind me. Drive faster. It's already late. Hey, just imagine if this motorcycle suddenly broke down. That'd be the end of us. In the middle of the woods like this, where to find a repair shop, right? What happened? Don't joke around, Wahyu!/ I'm not! Hang on. Oh, dear. The light's on, but the machine's off. So bizzare. How can it be broken? How do I know? Damn it! Wid, what do you think is happening? Let's not stop. Just walk. Hey, Widya. Wait for me!/ Come on. Widya, wait! What if I see something strange? Watch your words! Your big mouth caused this! Still, wait for me! Is there a party around here? You hear that too? Yu, do you remember... ...what the man said earlier? If something weird occurs, just ignore it. Pretend like nothing has happened. Okay?/ Okay. You see him too, right? His feet are touching the ground. Then he's human. Not a ghost. Come on. Wahyu. Come on!/ Wahyu! Don't be scared. I'm here. Your motorcycle broke down? Could you help us? Please help them. Just wait at our place. There's a party going on. Yes, Sir. Let's go!/ No. Just come along. Come on./ No. Stop saying no. Come! There's a party going on, then there must be food. Come on! Thank you so much, Sir. Come! Stop saying no. What's wrong with you? Yu, no! Come on. Don't be afraid. You have me here. Here, eat. It's delicious. Eat. Wid, eat. Come on! Control yourself! We're not exactly guests here. It's rude to not eat here. Eat! Greetings for audience... Come on. Let's leave. Leave. Now. Why do you want to leave? They're not even done fixing the motorcycle. Your motorcycle is fixed. But just stay here for a while. Enjoy the food. Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir. But I think we'll leave now. Then take some food with you. Wrap them with this. Really?/ Of course. Go on. For the others too. For my friends, too. Thank you, Sir. There you go. Come on. Hurry up! Let's go. Do you not understand... ...that we're only visitors here? You should be ashamed. We could be banished. What were you thinking, Bima? How could you follow your lust? Sorry, Nur. We made a mistake. Now I believe what Anton said. He often hears female moaning from your room. What do you mean, Nur? Bima. Bear the consequences yourself. Get up! Where's everyone else? I come with gifts. I thought you two got lost in the woods. Where's my snack? Our return journey was so exciting! Unforgettable for sure. Right, Widya? Come on, let's go in. Let's eat while I tell you all about it. Come on. Nur, Ayu, Bima? Have I got a story for you! Why are you guys looking so weak? Hey. I know. You all must be starving. What's the story, Wahyu? Listen. On the way back, in the middle of the woods... ...our motorcycle suddenly broke down. But suddenly, an old man helped us. And he invited me and Widya to a party! I am so full. A party? Yes, a party, with lots of food. Delicious food. And there was... ...a dancer there. She's beyond beautiful! Her body looks like a Spanish guitar. I wanted to play her. I'm full. It's your loss that you didn't come with me. Is there another village in the woods?/ There is! Nonsense. There isn't! As far as I know, this is the only village in the middle of the woods. For real, there's another village nearby. Yu... Mr. Prabu also said the same thing. That was what Ilham said too. Widya. But it was there, right? It was there, right, Widya? Widya, nod yes. Alright. Let's show them what I brought from the party. You'll see we're not talking nonsense. Where is it? You will believe me later. Monkey! This isn't monkey's meat, right? Yu... There's something else I don't understand aside from what happened earlier. Stop what you're doing, child. Widya? It'd be better... ...for you not to get involved. Or else... ...you will pay for it. I suggest you... ...to stay out of it. Stay out of what? You don't need to know. I respect... ...who is behind you right now. But I wouldn't hesitate... ...to hurt you... ...if you got involved. Do you understand, child? Bima? Bima. Time for morning prayer. I made a mistake, Nur. Did you really, Bima? I swear to God... ...I just realized it now. Don't include God's name in your mistake. Hear me out. I beg you. That night... ...I had a dream. It felt so real. Widya. Widya! Widya! Widya! Widya. She won't be able to escape... ...from the grip of the snake. Who are you? Call me Dawuh. Your friend... ...is ensnared in the ancient ritual of this village. I can help her. If you... ...do everything I tell you. What do I have to do? Go to Tapak Tilas. In the hut near the gamelan hall... ...you will find this Bangle. Give it to your friend... ...for her protection. This is the only way... ...to save her. And every night... ...you have to meet me. I will look after your friend. And if you do everything I say... ...you will get what you want. Anything you want. That's my promise. Oh, my God. She's a jinn! How could you believe a jinn? Nur. I swear to God! At that time... ...I only thought about Widya. Your lust took control of you, Bima. Istighfar. Forgive me, God. I caught you with Ayu yesterday. Who was the female Anton heard in your room? I only remember... ...Dawuh's temptations... ...haunt me every night. Where is the Bangle now? I don't know, Nur. I'm afraid... ...Widya is in danger. I also saw Widya with a snake in my dream. This must be a sign, Bima. I beg you... Don't let anybody else know. I'm prepared to pay the price. Bima's here. Another helping hand. Ungrateful person. Don't think... ...you won't pay the price. We were the ones... Nur!/ ...who were being made human sacrifices. But you... You! Find Mr. Prabu./ Yu. Go! Don't disturb. I'm already fine. I'm already peaceful. This is my area. We don't understand. When Bima and Nur came... ...the villagers suddenly got possessed and attacked us. Where's Miss Nur? She's resting at the post. Suddenly she was worn out. Hey!/ Yu. What's happening, Ton? Everything's ruined. Yu, where's Widya? Where's Widya? Yu! Nur? Ayu? Anton? Bima? Nur? What are you doing? Pretty child. You like it here? So? Have you met Badarawuhi? Why are you crying, pretty child? Please don't cry. It's not good to cry. Even that handsome boy... ...has met Badarawuhi. You don't know who I am, child? You think... ...if I wasn't here... ...your friends who caused the disaster... ...who are stupid enough to commit sins... ...won't bring harm to my granddaughter? I won't let my granddaughter be harmed... ...by anyone here. Do you understand, child? What do you mean by "harm", Mbah? Pretty child. Two of your friends will not stay alive... if they don't stop committing sins. Listen to me. Tell them... ...before they fall even deeper. They have crossed the line... ...that will make the situation worse. They might cause harm to the whole village. Nur! Nur! Nur? I'm scared, Nur. I have failed to look after you, Widya. I failed. Yu. I need to talk to you alone. Tell me. What are you trying to do? Tell me everything now. I don't understand. What are you saying? I found the Bangle in Widya’s bag. I also found a green shawl in your bag. You put the Bangle inside Widya's bag, didn't you? Where did you get that shawl? You stepped over the line, Nur. Why were you going through my stuff? That shawl is mine./ The Bangle is from Bima, isn't it? Bima got it after a dream. And do you know who was in his dream? She was a jinn, Ayu! Where did you get that shawl? From the same jinn! Come with me to Mr. Prabu's house. You have to tell him everything. Alright! Alright! I put the Bangle in Widya's bag. Not because Bima told me to. Then who? Bima did ask me to give it to Widya. But I didn't do it. And then a dancer came to me. She told me to give it to Widya. In exchange... ...she gave me a green shawl that could make Bima fall for me. You're crazy! You made a deal with a jinn! Meet me at the house. I need to talk to all of you. Let's go home. Our community service here ends tonight. Why? Why can't we finish it first? Ayu. Why are you crying? I know I made a mistake, Nur. But I'm begging you, Nur. We have to finish this community service, Nur. It's not fair to the others./ We all could be in grave danger, Bima. There's something wrong with this place. Why are you crying, Ayu? You chose this place!/ The place is not at fault! It's our fault! So we're going back tomorrow, Nur? Bima! Bima! Bima? Bima! Bima? Bima? Bima? Bima? Bima? Bima. Bima. You're the Dawuh that I've been waiting for. You smell really nice. Stay here, child. Stay here, child! Stay! Ayu. Wake up. Widya is gone. Ayu? Ayu. Ayu. Ayu. Ayu. Ayu, wake up! Help! Help! What is it, Nur? What happened now? Widya is gone. And I found Ayu in this state! Let's get Mr. Prabu! Where is Bima? Have you seen him?/ I don't know. Ayu, wake up! Wake up, Ayu! Greetings for audience... Ayu! How did this happen? Man! Bring Mbah Buyut here now!/ Yes, Sir! Ayu. Sir. Ayu and Bima were intimate at Tapak Tilas. God, no. But Bima wasn't his normal self. They followed everything the jinn said. Her name is Dawuh. I know my friends made a mistake, Sir. But I'm begging you to save Bima and Ayu. You, stupid! Why didn't you tell us earlier? Damnit! How could they have been intimate here! That's enough! Your friends are in danger! Now! Everyone, search! Everyone! Bima! Widya! Bima! Widya! Bima! Mbah... They broke the most important rule. Here. Do you know what these are? Both belong to the Dancer... The Goddess of this village. Dawuh. Dawuh... ...is not a name. That's the title... ...given to the dancer. Her name... ...is Badarawuhi. This Bangle... ...can only be worn... ...by the Dawuh that she has chosen. This green shawl... ...is used to captivate anyone... ...that she wants. What's going to happen with my friends? I'm begging you, please save them. Their souls... ...are in Angkaramurka now. Forgive us, God./ I can only hope she will let them go. You all wait here. Slowly. Slowly, sir. Careful. Move. Careful. Slowly. Oh, God. Oh, God. Widya. Widya. Widya. I followed Bima, Nur. I saw him there with the dancer. They were surrounded by so many snakes. Ayu was there too. She was in tears. She was forced to dance. She was helpless. Miss Nur... Miss Nur... Stop. The souls of your friends... ...are trapped in Angkaramurka. The snakes that you saw... ...are the offspring of Bima and Badarawuhi. And Ayu... ...has been made the new Dawuh. She has to keep dancing... ...every inch of the land in these woods. They're being punished... ...for what they did. For that matter... ...I can't help you. I'm sorry, child. I have failed to protect them. A long time ago... ...our ancestors believed... ...that by sacrificing our daughters... ...our village would be safe from misfortune. The gravestones covered in black cloth... ...are graves of those who were sacrificed... ...when this village was still under the devil's temptations. The gamelan hall at Tapak Tilas... ...was a venue for dance performances. Not for our villagers... ...but for the spirits that inhabit the village. I have failed to protect you all. It's my fault, Sir. I couldn't keep an eye on my friends. I have failed to keep your trust. Nur. Let's go home. Goodbye, Sir. That afternoon... ...I left the village with so much guilt. That won't go away even until today. Bima died four days after they returned home. Ayu died three months later. That was the last time I saw Mr. Prabu and Mbah Buyut. We... ...never went back there. I'm sure Miss Nur has asked you the same... ...to respect Bima and Ayu and their families... Please. Do not use our real names... ...and do not reveal the name of that village. Okay, Miss. Peace be upon you./ And upon you too. Kyai. Do you know that someone has been looking after me? Her name is Mbah Dok. She has been following you for a long time. I have asked her to leave you before. But she promised to look after you. In that village... ...she really kept her promise. You must be feeling heavy sometimes in this area. That means that Mbah Dok... ...is fighting the creatures that are trying to bother you. Peace be upon you. And upon you. Thank you for being willing to do a ritual. Please, listen carefully and follow all my instructions. Don't screw the order. You also have to remember... ...to treat my granddaughter... ...like a real human being. In front of you... ...there's a clay barrel. Put some water into the basin. After that... ...take the seven types of flowers. Put a pinch... ...of each... ...according to the sequence. First, red rose. Then white rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang... ...tuberose... ...white champak... ...and gambir jasmine. Now... ...walk toward the bier. Before opening the bier... ...make sure the hands and feet have been tied. Start tying from her left feet and hands. After that, her right feet and hands. Don't open the bier... ...if my granddaughter isn't tied yet. Open the bier's covering... ...and put it on the right side of my granddaughter. Now, start washing from her feet... ...to her abdomen... ...to her face. And then, her back. Follow my words. Humans are in this world... ...for a reason. Listen, you inhabitants of the world... This is my reason I serve my master. Humans are in this world... ...for a reason. Listen, you inhabitants of the world... This is my reason I serve my master. Humans are in this world... ...for... Listen, you inhabitants of the world... This is my reason I serve my master. Humans are in this world... This is my reason I serve my master. You can untie the rope on the left hand... ...when you wash her back. But make sure she's tied again... ...when the ritual is done. Humans are in this world... ...for a reason. Listen... ...you inhabitants of the world... This is my reason... ...I serve my master. Humans are in this world... ...for a reason. Listen, you inhabitants of the world... This is my reason I serve my master. Humans are in this world... Humans are in this world... ...for a reason. Listen... ...you inhabitants of the world... Sister... What, Jum? Come on, I don't.../ You don't what? You don't want to bathe her? Jum, why are you, a Kliwon girl, scared? You were born on a Kliwon Friday, weren't you? Listen to me... Stop it! Enough! I'm sweating. I'm cleaning the house wearing this over the top clothing. Let me change my clothes. Sister, the recording's broken. What should I do? What did you say?/ The recording's broken. But have you finished the ritual? I haven't. Not everything. Oh, dear! Come on! Hurry! Let's go, Jum. What should we do, Jum? Jum, come here. Turn it back to how it used to be. Hurry. Lift it. Sister, her hand's stuck. Oh, dear. Her feet. Put it in. This one?/ Yes. Hurry. Sister! Sister Ranti! Sister! Who are you, child? Who are you, child?
