[???] JILL: comes from the Greek word "meaning city of brotherly love. "We celebrated our 300th birthday in 1982. Today, Phila--" Jill, would you just look out the window, please? DAVID: that place over there? That's Independence Hall. Who wants to go take a look, huh? SUSAN: let's just keep driving, okay? JILL: is more than a city "of historical treasures. It is a modern city. A city on the move. A city reaching for the future!" [???] Now, look at that, 15 minutes from the center of downtown, Ooh, it's nicer than I remember. Hey, lady, where do you want it? SUSAN: in just a minute. Where's Trevor? Uh, I better go talk to him. Let me go show you your bedroom. Come on. I can't wait. Well, what do you think? Does it matter what I think? Oh, come on, bud. Give it a shot. [SEATBELT BUCKLE CLACKS] [???] Oh, honey, you can't wear that. That doesn't go with your uniform. I'm wearing it. If this was Grandpa's favorite tie, how come they didn't bury him in it? 'Cause Grandma wanted you to have it. Grandpa used to tickle you with this tie. You'd curl up in his lap and laugh yourself silly. But you were probably too young to remember that. I remember. [BELL RINGS] [CHALK SCRATCHING ON CHALKBOARD] Some of you have already come up with an idea for your American history project, but for those still deciding-- Well, Derek, good of you to grace us with your presence again today. Please, have a seat. Sorry, sir. MUHN: I expect each of you to prepare without fail a one-page outline on some topic relating to Philadelphia at the time of the American Revolution. Now, the final paper will be due at the end of the term. Ten to 12 pages, typed, double-spaced, with proper margins. This paper, I might add, will count for one half your grade this semester. Questions? Okay. Now turn to page 27. [WHISTLE TWEETS] [BOYS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Go! BOY: Wide open! Wide open! [GRUNTS] [WHISTLE TWEETS] [PANTING] Nice move, new boy. [WHISTLE TWEETS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, new boy, I was just wondering, is that a chicken or a duck on your tie? I said... is that a chicken or a duck? Okay, I guess there's just one way to find out. Let's see if it can swim. [LAUGHING] MAN: Hey, hey, whoa! Break it up. Break it up. It was just a tie! It was my grandfather's, jerk! So buy him a new one! [BOTH PANTING] He's dead. [???] I'll take it to the cleaners tomorrow, okay? This is more of a dress tie anyway. You probably shouldn't be wearing it to school. Who said I wanted to? So, uh... What do you need to get started on that report of yours? I don't know. Encyclopedias. History stuff. Well, uh, I'll tell you what. I've got to run by the office. What do you say I drop you off at the library? Sure. I guess. That's the spirit. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] American history's right over there. Did you have anything particular in mind? Not yet. Fine. Here's your temporary card. Okay, we'll meet out front in exactly one hour. All right? You all set? I guess. Can I borrow a buck for the snack machine? Sure. I think I still owe your allowance anyway. Heh. Here. Hey, don't forget. One hour. [???] MAN [GRUFFLY]: No. You can do better than that. [MAN CHUCKLES] [???] Need a little help? No. American history? Follow me. Term paper, correct? And you haven't got a clue as to what to do it on. Tell me if I'm getting warm. Look, mister, if you're trying to panhandle me, forget it. Didn't anyone ever tell you not to talk to strangers? Well, now, that's a valid point. On the other hand, if a person never talked to strangers, how would a person ever get to know anybody? Classic dilemma, wouldn't you say? Hey, pal, why don't you leave the kid alone? First of all, sir, I am not your pal. And secondly, it's none of your damn business. Is this guy bothering you, son? Go ahead. Speak up. It's under control. Thanks. Damn bums. Cleveland Meriwether, Minister of Education, at your service. That guy just called you a bum. A matter of opinion. What do you think? Yeah. [SIGHS] Well... Maybe... That's what I like. An open mind. Ha! My friends call me Cleve. Trevor. Trevor... I knew a Trevor once. Ballplayer, played shortstop. Did you ever play shortstop? Sometimes. Oh, heart of the team. Ah, here we are. Richard Saunders... Interesting fellow, this Saunders. Quit school when he was just about your age. Ran away from home to see the world. This was one of his first books. It's got some pretty good jokes in it. What's the matter? You don't like jokes? Yeah, but I think we're supposed to pick more of a heavyweight. Go on, go on, go on. Give it a try. I don't think so. [SIGHS] You're making this tough. All right. How about something on a famous American statesman, world traveler, musician, inventor, philosopher, all rolled up into one? Might work. Saunders was just his pen name... Otherwise known as Benjamin Franklin. Now, Franklin wasn't the only big thinker of his day. He was just the best. Like all brilliant men, he had the knack of taking something complicated and making it look simple. Like electricity. I mean, without the... Are you getting this down? Yes, sir. Which is not to say that the man didn't struggle. He came to this town without a nickel or a friend. And without a break here and there, he could've ended up that way. It happens. You can quote me on that. Yes, sir. The name is Cleve. Save that "sir" crap for the army. Well, you did say you were the Minister of Education. And don't you forget it. [CHUCKLES] Now... That library card you got there... Franklin's idea. He started the first subscription library right here in Philly. You could write a whole report just on that alone. But I don't want to leave you with the-- How do you know all this stuff? Pay attention. I don't want to leave you with the wrong idea. Ben Franklin was no saint. He loved his women. He loved his wine. Loved his nights out with the boys, but most of all, he loved his freedom. And that brings me to the single most important thing he ever did in his whole life. What's that? He-- He and a bunch of his drinking buddies told the King of England to go to hell. I can't write that in my report. You don't have to. They did it for you. Did you ever hear of a piece of paper called the Declaration of Independence? Well, no one says "Go to hell" in that. [LAUGHS] That's what you think. Have you got a set of encyclopedias at home? Somewhere, in a box. We just moved. Oh. Well, then you better give me some money. Why? So I can make you a copy of this declaration. You can't write about something you haven't even read, can you? I don't have any money. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hand it over. [???] You don't trust me, do you? [SIGHS] Here. You were supposed to meet me out front. I'm sorry. I forgot. Who's that you were talking to? No one. Just some guy. Trev, this is a tough city. it is not a good idea to go around talking to strangers. Fine. Who can I talk to then, Dad? Everyone's a stranger around here. [BELL RINGS] I'm sorry. MUHN: history project selections. Who'd like to go first? James. JAMES: My report will be on the Second Continental Congress of May, 1775. Is that okay? Very good. Larry? Uh, Paul Revere. He's the guy who rode around yelling, "The British are coming!" "The British are coming!" [ALL LAUGH] Very impressive rendition, Larry. Thank you. Derek? My report's going to be on the secret life of Benjamin Franklin. That's fine, Derek. Trevor? Uh... I, uh... guess I don't have one. You don't have one? I used to, but... Somebody already took it. I was gonna do Benjamin Franklin. I see. Well, if I'm not mistaken, Benjamin Franklin lived well into his 80s. So I suppose there's enough of him to go around. You can both do him. No problem. Now, gentlemen, I'll be available in my office this afternoon for any consultation you may need. Hey, new boy! Wait up! About the tie. I didn't know it was that big a deal. Oh, so to make it up to me, you steal my report idea. Hey, I was in a jam. But guess what? We're partners. What are you talking about? I talked it over with Mr. Muhn. I told him that if we work together, it might help you fit in better. He thought it was a great idea. Told him you thought so too. I think it sucks. Hey, come on! Wanna be the new boy all your life? Taking the train? Maybe. Ever done it before? What's it to you? Lighten up, would you? If we're gonna be partners, we can at least ride together. You want the Haverford stop. It's 90 cents. Go on. Put your money in. [CLINKING] [BUZZING] Sometimes it screws up, so you always have to check it. So far, so good. Pretty flowers for your sweetheart. There it is. Come on. [BUZZER SOUNDS] That buzzer means you got Okay. Whatever you do, don't lose this ticket. They collect them after you get on. Okay, okay. Hand it over. One last thing. If you ever miss your train, remember, you can always... [GRUNTS] walk! [LAUGHING] Hey! Hey! Hey, that's all the money I got! [???] [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] [COINS CLINKING] Leave it, or I'll break your wrist. I wasn't gonna take it. I was just gonna put it back. Yeah, sure you was. I was. Just let go. Don't lie to me, boy. I've been watching you. Real close. Now let it go! [???] [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] That you? It is you! Hardly recognized you in that fancy getup. What did you do, join the damn stock exchange? They're just my school clothes. Trevor, wasn't it? The shortstop? Yeah, and you owe me a dollar. Hey! You disappeared on me. There you go. The Declaration of Independence. We're even. How's that report coming, anyway? Fine. How much did this cost? Twenty-five cents a copy. Well, then you owe me 75 cents. Seventy-five cents is my consulting fee. We're even. Well, I need it. Come on, I need it to get home. Well, that's a problem, see, because I've already spent it. You could call home. Have you got a quarter? Normally, this would be no big deal, but you just happen to have caught me a little short of funds. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Guess what? I'm just on my way to the bank. [CHUCKLES] Isn't that just like life? Eight bucks a pint. Dollar a minute. Not a bad deal, huh? TREVOR: I guess. Only problem is, you can only come here every so often. You have to learn to discipline yourself. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Relax. You'll be out of here in no time. How far is home? Gladwyne. Ooh, ooh. A very august community. Where do you live? In town here. Where's that? Oh. No place you'd know. I only need one. Interest. All reputable institutions pay interest. Thanks. So... How's our friend Ben Franklin? Not so hot. Well, if you ever need any help, you know where to come, don't you? The Minister of Education. That's me. See you around, shortstop. Well... bye. Bye. [???] So, how's our report going? Our report? I'm not doing any of the work for you. Come on, man. You're not still mad about the train thing, are you? Shh. [SIGHS] It was just a joke. When I came here, they did the same crap to me. That's what guys do, that's all. We don't have to be enemies. Great, first, you dump on me, and now you wanna be my friend? You're brilliant, Derek. Let me tell you something, new boy. The kids here, they're fake. I've been in this place a year now. And they still don't talk to me. I wonder why. You want it that way? You wanna be on the outside your whole life? Stick it. MUHN: Derek. Trevor. [SIGHS] Just think about it, new boy. [???] [SIGHS] I need you. CLEVELAND: Okay, try reading that back. "Ben Franklin was what you call a free thinker. "He spent as much time studying cabbages as he did electricity, and that's a little known fact." Here. You do the rest. Write it for you? I can't do that, son. Wouldn't be right. Well, I'll pay you. Sorry. It's against the law for the Minister of Education to write somebody else's report. [SIGHS] Something troubling you? No. You sure? Oh. Speaking of trouble. Act like you don't know me. [HUMMING] What are you talking--? Shh. You don't know me. [HUMMING] Okay, Cleve... what'd I tell you about bothering the patrons here? I'm not bothering anyone. And what did I tell you about this being a free country? Is there some new law or something that says a man can't conduct research in a public library? Is he bothering you, kid? No. Okay, let's see this research. When hell freezes over. All right. Let's go then. [STAMMERS] No. I can walk. I can walk. GUARD: your social worker. Cleve, my report. [???] So you're back on the streets? I still got a couple of brain cells left. I know how to take care of myself. I don't understand it, Cleve. If anyone's got a chance of getting off those streets, it's you. It's just the natural order of things, Mr. Benedetti. If it weren't for guys like me, you'd be out of a job. And before you know it, you'd be down here taking my place. I'd say I'm doing you a big favor. BENEDETTI: So, what happened, Cleve? You didn't like that halfway house I got for you? [CLICKS TONGUE] Well... I only halfway liked it. [CHUCKLES] Come on, let me walk you home. Whatever happened to that fella... What's his name... Leonard? You know, the one those punks torched. Did he ever make it out of the hospital? Oh, yeah, he made it out... Feet first. [SIGHS] Cleve, you know, I'm gonna have to write up some kind of report today. So, what's this about you hanging around with kids? CLEVELAND: Kid. Kid. One. Anyway, what difference does it make? I wouldn't hurt anyone. You know that. Sure, I know it, but the rest of Philadelphia doesn't know it. Look at yourself, Cleve. You are exactly the type of person that every parent warns their kids to stay away from. I know. [???] [SIGHS] CLEVELAND: half a cup of wine. A dry white is good. Not too much. Just enough to moisten the cornmeal. The wine and the sausage. That's the secret. See you later, gents. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Time for a little beauty rest. Hey, you rotten punk. [RINGS] Listen, they got my uncle coming in here at 3:00. And he's not gonna be real happy. If he finds out we didn't turn in our outline... I told you, I don't have it. Trevor, he's going to kick my butt. Over a report? You don't know my uncle. Look, I really need this, okay? [???] Hey! It's you again? Get off me! I sai-- I said let go! No, not this time, boy. CLEVELAND: Hey, hey, hey! Scorpio, leave him be. Hey, man, I caught him going through your stuff. That's okay. We got no secrets. Have we, shortstop? You know this boy? Trevor, meet Mr. Scorpio Warfield, Minister of Music. Well, at least say hello. Hello. Cleve, man, you're nuts. Nuts. I see you found your report. I was sort of hoping you wouldn't. Thought maybe you'd like to do it over, put a little more effort into it, more imagination. You know what I mean? It's fine. I gotta go. So, uh, wait-- Who's this Derek? You put his name on the top of your report. He some sort of friend of yours, or what? Ah, I see. But not really. [CHUCKLES] got your number, eh? What's that supposed to mean? Look, son. I'll make you a deal. You come back on Saturday, I'll help you turn that report into something special. Okay. What time? Oh, around noon's fine. But there's a catch. You bring this Derek character with you. Uh. No way. He won't come. That's the deal. Why? If he's gonna have his name on that thing, he's gotta do some of the work. Well, forget it, then. Trevor. No secrets. Not if we're gonna be partners. Hey. Who's keeping secrets? Trying to pass yourself off as some kind of genius, the Minister of Education, give me a break! You're just a bum. [???] [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY OVER HEADPHONES] [SIGHS] [???] You know, you're wasting your time. Quarter say he don't show. You're on. Fine. Well, I got to go make a living, but I will be back later to collect my money. [CHUCKLES] Oh, Mr. Warfield. [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [LAUGHING] Well, well, well. Right on time. Hi. Oh, this is Derek. Hello, Derek. Well, let's get going, then. Uh, Trevor. Trevor, what are you doing? This guy's a bum. Looks like he's gonna croak any minute. So are you coming or not? No way. Here, then. Just take it. I'll do my own. I never wanted to be your partner anyway, jerk. Fine with me. Sorry about what I said yesterday. I didn't mean it. That was yesterday. Right now we got work to do. What about him? It's your paper. [???] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Here you are. "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Great way to get a country going, don't you think? Yeah. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind taking a photograph of me and my young friend here? [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [BOTH LAUGH] Funny, isn't it? The bigger the man, the harder it is to describe him. Now... look here. You make a wish. Like this: [SPITS TWICE] And throw it on the grave. [SPITS] It doesn't count unless it comes up heads. Now close your eyes and concentrate. [???] Heads. So it is. That was 20 years ago, now. Heh. I just sort of gravitated toward this place. Felt at home here. Still do. And you never got another job since? Oh, I've had jobs, all right. It's keeping them that's been tricky. Well, how come you left Indiana in the first place? You a nosy one, aren't you? No secrets, remember? [LAUGHS] Here we go. [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] They just toss these out. One day of glory and out they go. Doesn't seem right, does it? You know something? Sometimes, you remind me of someone. Yeah? Who's that? My grandfather. [???] He died a few months ago. Come on. It's getting late. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] What happened? Did someone get killed? Who was it this time? It's the little guy. It's Jake. Found him in a garbage can. Damn jackals. Who are you? I said, what's your name? Trevor. Trevor Atwood. Cleveland, I tell you-- Now, I know, I know, but-- Save it. Where you from, son? Gladwyne. You get your little butt back to Gladwyne. I ever catch you around here again, I'm gonna have you down to Juvenile Hall faster than you can recite the alphabet, understand? Well, last time I checked, it was a free country. Damn it, kid. There was a man killed down here today. This isn't a playground. He's right, shortstop. Anyway, you got enough material for your report, don't you? Yeah, I guess. Write a good one. [BELL TOLLING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, Susan. Thanks again for taking on the clothing drive. It's been a big help. And we'll get another load out to you in the morning. Another load? It's just for a couple weeks. Thought you're volunteering, not running the whole thing. Well, they asked me. What could I do? Where are we sending the clothes? I think they said Romania. All of it? Why can't we give it to people here, in Philadelphia? I just help collect it, honey. The church decides where it goes. That's stupid. What was that? [SIGHS] Never mind. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Trevor, what's this? None of your business. Who's that man with you? Nobody. A friend of mine's grandfather. What friend? A kid at school. Derek. Now just get outta here, okay? Excuse me. TREVOR: Bye! Don't you want breakfast? No time. See ya later. Did you finish your report? Yeah, all done. Gotta go! REPORTER [ON TV]: the offenders. Sir. What happened to the team? Done. I turned in the report. You're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble. Hope you know that. My mom was gonna give these away. [GASPS] Phew. Oh... That is cold. Pretty soon, it's gonna freeze up altogether. What makes you think I'd be interested in somebody's old clothes? Well, you won't take money. [SCOFFS] Come on, look. They're all washed and everything. Here, what do you think? Green's not my color. [SIGHS] [???] [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] She like it. She say it will be warm for a new baby. And she say thank you. Don't thank me. Thank Trevor, here. Thank you, Trevor. Their whole family lives out here? In the streets? A lot of families do. Funny how people become invisible. When you keep your eyes closed. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Sir? Would you like these? He won't say anything. Never has. Just put them down on the table in front of him. Let's go. CLEVELAND: Here's your pal. Last pair, Mr. Warfield. You sure? You actually like him? What's not to like? Mr. Warfield, by the way, won two Purple Hearts in Vietnam as a medic. Everybody has their story. [???] Wanna come with me? I got an extra ticket. [ANNOUNCER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] My mom's got some extra clothes at home. We can bring them back here-- Trevor. Benedetti wasn't kidding the other day. Lucky for both of us, he didn't catch us today. [SIGHS] I better go. Wait... I got one more thing. [???] It was my grandpa's. [CHUCKLES] It's beautiful. But I can't take this. Best keep it in the family. I want you to have it. Please? I'd be honored. But it doesn't change what I said. Stay away. Please. Okay? [BUZZER BUZZES] Tell you what. Soon as I get myself situated, I'll give you a call. NURSE: I'm afraid there's a note against your name in our records. Your blood isn't acceptable anymore. What do you mean, my blood isn't good anymore? I've been giving blood here for years. I know, and I'm sorry, but your samples from last time tested way too low in iron. What is this? A scrap yard now? Mr. Meriwether, I-- I'm sorry. Describe yourself, Mr. Meriwether. I, uh, I'd say... earnest. [CHUCKLES] No, I mean professionally. You've indicated here that you've had a variety of jobs. Dishwasher. Various messenger services-- Don't forget the fly bills. I bet I've given out a million of those fly bills. What I'm trying to ascertain here is do you have a preferred career? As I said, I was a carpenter for 23 years. That was before I hurt my back. Uh, Mr. Meriwether, um... A park ranger's work is not for everybody. It can be very physically demanding, and there's a great deal of training involved. That's why we usually hire young people for a-- That's the beauty of it. You don't have to train me. I've done more of those tours than you can count. I can do that Liberty Bell tour in my sleep. Matter of fact, some of my friends say that I have. [LAUGHS] For instance, did you know there's a word misspelled on that bell? No. It's Pennsylvania. They forgot one of the Ns. You know that? Actually, no. But I-I don't see how it relates. Oh, oh, it relates. It relates. It just goes to show that nobody's perfect. People have to know that too, right? [EXHALES] Yes. [SIGHS] Well, it-it also says here that you've been hospitalized a number of times for alcoholism. Now, that's a rather frank admission. It's just a fact. But I'll tell you this: I've been sober now for two straight months. And if I get this job, I'll stay that way, I give you my word on it. [INHALES DEEPLY] I, uh... I got a feeling the job's taken. Well, I can't say that we have anything for you at this time, Mr. Meriwether. [???] Okay. I understand. What'd you get? A. A-plus, actually. I got a fail slip. You gotta help me. Well, I tried to. I know, but... You gotta. My uncle will kill me. [SIGHS] I have to go. I'm not kidding. He'll really come down on me. He says I'm just wasting his money here. Well, what's your uncle have to do with anything? He's my mom's brother. Military dude. She pawned me off on him, right after she got married again. What do you mean? I guess her new husband was allergic to kids. What, your mom just dumped you? [???] Where is she now? Colorado. Somewhere. Tell you what. Meet me in the school library tomorrow afternoon. We'll ace the rewrite. I'll pay you back, man, I swear. Don't worry about it. Everybody's got their story. [???] Hey, Cleveland! Cleveland, get up. I got something to show ya. Just leave him be. Cleve, check it out. Hey. [GROANING] G-g-go away. I got an A. A-plus. CLEVELAND [GROANING]: G-go away. I said, leave him be. He don't wanna see you. It's our term paper. You okay? [GROANING] What's wrong with you? [CLEVELAND COUGHING] [CONTINUES GROANING] SCORPIO: What's the matter? You never seen a drunk before? Or maybe he just forgot to tell you that part. Shut up. You don't know what you're talking about. And that ain't all he forgot to tell you, I'll bet. He tell you he had a car accident once? Hmm? Huh, boy, he tell you that? So? He tell you he killed someone in that accident? A kid? And that he's been a bum and a drunk ever since? Did he tell you that, boy? Or maybe he just forget. [???] [???] My man. DEREK: Hey, Trevor! Let's go! Come on, Trevor, let's go. You, you. You, you. You. Can you lift your own weight? Oh, absolutely. Heh. Oh, okay. You. Let's go. All right, that's it for today. Line up and get your pay. Hey, gramps, you, uh, wanna join us for a beer? Some other time. Buy yourself a couple on me. Thank you. [???] I gave this to you. I figured you'd want it back. Well, I gave it to you 'cause I wanted you to have it. Here. [SPUTTERING] Hey. Hey. I got a job now. Won't be long. I'll be back on my feet. That's good. Yeah, practically rich. Heh, heh. C-can I buy you a burger or something? No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Cup of coffee, then. [SPUTTERING] Damn it. Then just come and watch me eat. Okay? [CHUCKLES] Scorpio said you killed someone. A kid. In a car accident. Well, they said it wasn't my fault. I don't know. Were you drunk then? No. That came later. Just something I can't seem to control. I don't know why, really. Just a weakness, I guess. Now, I'm-I'm sorry. Hey. I tell you I got a new job? Yeah. A couple times. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, miss. Freshen up my friend's root beer, will you? Oh, I should go. I'm supposed to meet some guys at the station. Finally got yourself some friends, huh? That's good. Keep you out of trouble. Who let him in here? He's got money. He showed me. Tough. I want him out. Last time he was here, he stiffed me. Says who? We flipped for it, fair and square. Out. Hey, come on, mister. We're paying customers, just like everyone else. Out. The both of you. [SIGHS] That jerk. Oh, forget it. Woods are full of guys like that. Hey, what's this? They said it wasn't gonna snow till after Christmas. That'll help. Nothing like a nice, fresh snowfall to clear the air. Eh, shortstop? Come on. Let's go. [???] [JINGLING] Ho! WOMAN [OVER PA]: and Merry Christmas. There is a special going on now in the ladies department... It's really soft. Oh, it's 100 percent cashmere. Ooh, yikes. Look at the price tag. Aw, you think Daddy will like it? [SIGHS] Okay, we'll take it. [BOTH WOMEN CHUCKLE] All right, Mom, I'm gonna take off. I got my own shopping-- Okay, just take your sister with you. Mom. Aw, Trevor, come on. Sorry, pops. You just aren't cutting it. I gotta let you go. Hey. I-I just got a little hitch in my back. I mean, I can do it. I can do it. I-- There ya go. Just call it, uh, a Christmas bonus. [???] TREVOR: they're sitting on. [BAND PLAYING "AWAY IN A MANGER"] Let's go. No, I want to stay. Mr. Scorpio, the baby. She's coming. She's coming. Please, come now. Lupe. The baby, she's coming. Where? There. Well, tell me the name of the hospital. Not in a hospital. Mr. Scorpio, he will do it. What? I have to go and help. Let's go. Trevor. Trevor, we're gonna be late. [PLAYING "SILENT NIGHT"] SCORPIO: Push. Push. [???] [SCREAMING] [WOMAN LAUGHING] SCORPIO: Aw. Yes. [BABY CRYING] [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [EXHALES HEAVILY] Trevor. Mom's gonna kill us. I want to go now. Wait. Just wait a second. [???] What's wrong? You mean you knew this was going on, and you didn't even bother to call us? They weren't breaking the law, Mr. Atwood. Like I said, I thought I put a stop to it. Well, I'll put a stop to it. Where is this, uh, Meriwether? SUSAN: just terrifies me. You read so many things in the newspapers. The man has his shortcomings, Mrs. Atwood, but nothing like that. Compared to everything else out there in those streets... he's really pretty harmless. Harmless or not, he's still a drunk. Why aren't these people in hospitals? Laws have changed. People aren't automatically hospitalized anymore. It's more...humane. And a lot cheaper. Of course, if Meriwether committed a crime or something, that'd be different. But, uh, as far as I know, there's no crime in being friendly. Careful there. A good doctor is hard to find. Getting cold. Yes, sir. By the way, I've got a bone to pick with you. Yeah? What's that? Danny... Ah-- I mean Trevor. I wish you hadn't told him about my accident. I kinda like that kid. Bad luck. I just ran into him. He's doin' okay. Still, no point in puncturing his dreams. Dreams? [SIREN WAILING] I came back from the 'Nam with a million of 'em. Hm. I was in a band before I went there. You ever hear the Detroit sound? No. Real big in the '60s. Sax Man, they called me. Yeah. Big car. Big money. Real nice lady. Then I went in... By the time I came back, the whole scene had changed. Disco was the thing. Heh. Didn't nobody know who the Sax Man was. Not even me. That's when it hit me. The fact that I had changed too. Guess I had just seen too much ugliness. Too much blood. I had a million dreams, all right. Now all I care about is staying dry. [???] [SOFTLY] Trevor. You asleep? Hm-mm. [SIGHS] What did they name the baby? I don't know yet. Are you gonna get in trouble? I don't know. But they did say if I ever see him again-- Will you? JILL: So that's him. He looks like someone. Who does he look like? Grandpa. Yeah... MAN: when you got nothing to give? Wakey, wakey. Who is that? Wha-- What do you want? Take a wild guess. Come on, gramps. Give us the money. [???] You're not gonna get a dime outta me! Whatever you say, pal. Woo! [GROANS] [GROANS] [ALL GRUNTING] Oh! Aah! Oh! I look in the window, and there's old lady Shemlick standing there totally-- And I mean totally-- Hey. Pretty flowers for your sweetheart, mister. Trevor! Trevor, guess what? We gave the new baby a name. He's named Phil. That's a good one. I like that name. And Trevor, we are sad about your friend. I hope he will not die. What do you mean? What friend? Your Mr. Meri. He was hurt. Mr. Scorpio was there too. The police came. Everybody came. What? DEREK: Trevor. Trevor, come on. Where is he? Trevor, we're out of here. LUPE: I think. [???] BENEDETTI: more than your money. A buck's a buck. Damn jackals. So as soon as we get your ribs healed up, I'm gonna show you your new room. You heard about the Savoy? Oh, yeah. A real pleasure palace. [LAUGHS] You-- You sure got connections, Benedetti. Yeah, right. Any sign of Scorpio yet? No, huh-uh. Word is he left town. Probably the best move he's made in a long time. Excuse me, Mr. Meriwether, you've got a visitor downstairs. A young man, he says he's your grandson. [SIGHS] [CLICKS TONGUE] Oh, Lord. Tell him to go. No, please, send him up. All right. Huh? End it, Cleve. I don't care how you do it, but end it. [???] Hey, shortstop. How's tricks? They said you might be dead. Hell, heh, they hardly scratched me. I can take care of myself. What about Scorpio? Busted him up. Busted his horn up too. He's just...disappeared. When I heard you might die... I was thinking. I really miss you, Cleve. I want us to be friends again. Well, now that's a problem, see. Because I really don't. Not after all this. Scorpio was right. I mean, you're just nothing but bad luck. Why? What did I do? I-- It's just too much trouble trying to keep my nose clean with you around. And now, they got me fixed up with a room at the Savoy hotel. And if you don't blow it for me, I can stay there all winter. You wanna blow that for me? No! But-- All right, then. Get. [???] Look... You remember asking me about the accident I had? Whether it was true that I killed some kid? Well... It wasn't just "some kid" who died. It was my kid. My own son, Danny. He was 13 years old. [CHUCKLES] How old are you again? Fourteen. Well, don't you see? I've just been using you. I thought maybe you could help me. But you're not Danny. It's him that I love. It's him that I care about. Not you. WOMAN [ON TV]: it's a cotton mill. Well-- Won't you look pretty, standing up with the head man? MAN [ON TV]: Hold your-- SUSAN: Trev! There isn't a more profitable undertaking. SUSAN: Honey, there's a phone call. [CHANNELS SWITCHING RAPIDLY] MAN 2 [ON TV]: You gangsters. Throw my body in the ditch, will you? Well, I'm just as alive... Trevor, where are you? The phone's for you. It's Derek. Hello? Hello? [HANGS UP] I guess he hung up. Oh. Well, call him back. Well, I don't have to. He wants to know if he can sleep over Friday. Oh, that's fine. Except it's our Christmas party night. You guys will have to get a video, or something like that. Whatever. Hey, I baked a batch of those for you to take to school. Trev? Merry Christmas, Trevor. Thanks. You too, Derek. What is this? Mr. Muhn's present. WOMAN: Hey. Hey. Wanna go out? Wanna go out, honey? Anybody? Come here, cutie. Hey. Chicken? [TV DRONING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Another winter. [MAN COUGHING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Stamp your feet. [STAMPS FEET] Sir, is there a Cleveland Meriwether here? Who wants to know? I have something for him. No, no. No kids allowed in here. Out. Beat it. Sir? Merry Christmas. All right. Third floor. Last door on your right. And make it quick. [TOILET FLUSHES] [???] Oh, God. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [LAUGHING] [CRYING] [GULPS] ALL: With boughs of holly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ? ? 'Tis the season To be jolly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ? ?

Restoring power and water to several sections of the city could take until tomorrow... Hold it. Let's hear this. MARK: Let's go downtown for a report of those areas without power and water. Shauna James, just how cold is it out there? It's really cold, Mark. I'm standing in the mission district, where workers have been making a valiant effort to try to restore heat to this crowded and very vulnerable neighborhood. One official I spoke to said they simply do not have the resources to take care of the problem any time soon. And while they're attempting to bring in emergency crews, most city workers are already on leave for the holidays. Let's just watch the video. I said leave it on. SHAUNA: for several hours now. Scores of residents have been forced to seek warmth elsewhere. Unfortunately, Mark, that's not easy. Not tonight, at least. And there really is no place for the homeless to go. Workers say they'll do everything-- What are you doing, man? Come on, get dressed. We're going downtown. Are you crazy? I guess. How do we get there? The trains stop at midnight. We still have time. How would we get back? We'll figure something out. Forget it. I'm not going out. [TV DRONING INDISTINCTLY] Fine, stay here, then. I'm going. You're crazy, man. You could die out there. Here, use this. If anyone come in while you're up, tell them I'm asleep. Just tell them anything. Whatever you do, don't tell them where I went. ALL: ? ...partridge in a pear tree ?

Lupe, what are you doing here? Where's Cleve? Mr. Meri? He give us this room for Christmas. He say too cold for baby Philly on the street. Wait, he left? Why? We tell him to stay, but you know Mr. Meri. He's stubborn. You like to see Philly? He fat now. Lupe, this is important. What did he say? Did he tell you where No. He just go. Wait, I think he said he going home. Home? And he say if I see Trevor, he say thank you for the cookies. He say he love them. He say he love you. [???] [BABY CRYING] [WIND WHISTLING] [SNOWPLOW HONKS] Kid have anything more to say? Still working on him. Okay. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] TREVOR: Cleve. [PANTING] Cleve. Cleve! Cleve! [VOICE CRACKS] Cleve! I told you, I don't know. Just downtown. That's all he said. Look, son, this is a very serious business. Think harder. DAVID: This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna sit around any longer. I'm gonna look for him. He could be anywhere. Check in every half hour. I don't want you going out in the freezing cold. It's okay. We found him. [???] Stay away! Come on home, son. No. Everything's going to be okay. No. It's not gonna be okay. Ever. Trevor. TREVOR: No! You wanted to help people that you didn't even know. People that you've never even seen. But you wouldn't help him. To you, he was just a bum. But he wasn't a bum. He wasn't. [SOBS] No! Just leave me alone. Go home and leave me alone. I wanna stay here. I wanna stay here with my friend. My friend. Go away. DAVID: It's okay, Trev. [???] [???] [SIGHS] Are you okay? My dad used to say, uh... he lost everything in the Depression, except his life. That could've been him out there tonight, Susan. That could've been anybody. I know. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Mm. Smells good. Okay, yeah. Just step down... [???] That smells good. [???] Merry Christmas. [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] Excuse me, one sec. Oh, okay. Merry Christmas. Got a new horn. Yeah. [SIGHS] That your car? Yeah. Got a job playing music. Why'd you come back here, then? Say goodbye. It's too late. He's gone. I know. I came back to say goodbye to you. [PLAYING "AMAZING GRACE"] [???] [SPITS] Know what I wished, Cleve? I wish I could see my grandfather's face when he sees you wearing his tie. [???]
