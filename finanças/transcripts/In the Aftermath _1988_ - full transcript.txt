'I was nine years old 'and they said I was ready for travel and experience. 'And I wondered, when I rendezvoused with my brother, 'of all the places he'd seen 'and whether he'd ever carried an egg. 'Because my brother... oh, my brother, he had plenty of advice for me. 'And I didn't want to hear it.' I won't do it. Why did you call me here? I want to go swim in the clouds. Because, Angel, it is time for you to run. Run through the many rooms of this constellation you're standing in. What? Find and save a group of special creatures and the land that they live in. What if they have sharp fangs and want to bite me? I'm just a little angel, I don't know if I should be doing this. But it is the duty of all angels to be angels. Angel, we do fly in the face of all peril. - But I'm not ready yet. - Oh, you are. You'll need to judge who needs your help and who shouldn't have it. Remember, the devil lurks. So go nurture your egg and when the time comes, save only those creatures who will blossom from your energy. How will I be able to know who's deserving? Wouldn't it be better if you did this? I don't want to mess things up. Because the force that makes the starts shine and the planets spin around will send your heart on the proper course. Hey, Frank, look at this. It looks clean. Do you think it's from an eagle? Not unless the eagle has a gas mask. Come on, Tonto, let's find some air. ♪ I was strolling on the Earth one day ♪ In the merry merry month of September... ♪ October.

Goose, get your arse down here. I know I didn't scare the piss out of you. Yeah? What makes you so sure? Cos I haven't pissed for days. Have you? Nope. Haven't got much to do with the old boy. Yeah? Well, it's a good thing Dave is not here. Shut up, Goose. What's with the John Wayne? Just follow me, soldier. Check over there. Nice tune, soldier. What can I do for you? We're running out of charcoal filters for our air pack. How long have you got left? About six days. Six days... Six days of pure oxygen? Where did you get the air-purifier unit? It came with the recon unit. God... I could kill for six days of pure oxygen. Well, I gotta move. Where are you going, buddy? I didn't mean anything personal. - Hey, don't worry. - It's just a figure of speech. It's just a figure of speech. I said, "Nothing personal." Hey, buddy, I didn't take it personally. Why did you do that, buddy? Come on! ♪ I was strolling on the Earth one day ♪ In the merry merry month of May ♪ A roguish pair of eyes, they took me by surprise... ♪ Hey, Frank. I found another empty. I'm good at finding empties. Did you have any luck? I said, "Did you have any luck?" Who are you? Give me your backpack. - Identify yourself. - Give me your backpack. Bloody typical. 'There weren't many creatures left with breath, 'and this one looked dangerous, 'and fiendish and beastly strong to me. 'I was still a little angel, 'more suited to find some gentle creature to save with my power. 'But then he showed me a sparkle I had not yet seen in men.' Goose! 'He was the only one left of his gang so I ventured to him with timid hope. 'But I was too afraid. 'This creature staggered with dizzy thoughts. 'I'm sorry he had to drag his bones after me 'but I didn't know what to do. 'I held everything he desired 'but I was wary of evil grabbing hold of it 'and I didn't know if this was a man who could sing harmony with us angels. 'I tested him with a sign and he fell from confusion. 'I needed advice and wasn't about to ask the creature. 'I didn't know what to do. 'My parcel trembled at the idea of wicked hands taking hold of it. 'It told me to run. 'And the faster I ran, the more I saw the grey world. 'I think my crafty brother planned it that way. 'It was though I stepped through a tiny door 'and on the other side was a vast galaxy of grey. 'And somehow I had to make use of it. 'I felt I was the only one present at a carnival of ghosts. 'It was filled with everything but vastly empty. 'So I attended to my duty as custodian of the egg. 'But then I thought, as I sat in this carnival of shadows, 'that he too might be lost, bewildered in his world. 'And that if he would seek me with his heart 'I would seek and save him with mine.' 'My brother... I had something most important to tell him.' Jonathan! I have something for you. It's over here. Hello. How are you feeling? Who are you? I'm Doctor Sarah Fallsburg. You're at Green Acres Memorial Hospital. I found you about a hundred yards from here. I thought you were dead. Why did you lock me in the operating room? The reason the door is closed is because this is the only room in the hospital that has a constant supply of clean air. Those supply oxygen tubes are connected to air-purifiers in the basement. Contamination level is very high. Did you find anybody else? No. Why? Who else is here? Just you. Here. Drink this. I'm fine. The reason you're fine is because you've been hooked up to this. Now, you've got a slight infection. Now, here. Drink this. 'What a big question this constellation was, 'and I was to show my brother that step by step, 'I was untwisting its mysteries. 'I, all by my little self, had discovered a grand something. 'But those same young years hadn't yet realised 'that my brother had been here before, 'as had all other angels.' Angel, have you heard the Tale of Tessaria? Once there was a great traveller who knew many planets. He talked of them wherever he went. And people were eager to hear his stories. Was Tessaria one of these planets? - It was his name. - Did you know him? I met him once, and he told me this story. There was a most unusual planet and on this planet, fish flew in the air, and performed dazzling feats of acrobatics. They used clouds for trampolines and they were as big as whales. These fish were never seen anywhere else. In the meantime, people begged the planetary traveller to take them there. But he discovered that some who wanted to go had evil motives. He couldn't decide whom to trust so he took no one. One day a man pretending to be his friend got him drunk and stole his chart. The chart of all the places he had been. The evil man rushed to the planet. With his ropes and hooks he pulled all the fish off the planet. And where can I find this planet? If you put your ear to the heavens and listen to the sound of a man crying, that is Tessaria sitting alone on a planet with no fish. Now I have something else to show you. Does Tessaria sound like this man? 'And from that sign of hopelessness I turned to see a sign of hope. 'A beautiful sign. 'But my brother cautioned that it could mean anything. 'He's a doodler, perhaps. 'Or maybe the devil sketching a scheme. 'I truly hoped he wasn't. "'But if you're wrong", he cautioned, "this could happen." Cheers. Who's the girl? I thought I saw her running around in San Pedro. Er... She was carrying a giant egg in her hand. I know it sounds crazy. A giant egg? Never mind. There's no way I can go back out there and risk finding her. Right? No, I don't think so, Frank. Here, I've got something for you. What are you doing? Just hold on a sec. Where are you going? You'll see. What's the matter? Didn't you like it? You were great. I just felt a bit dizzy, that's all. That was a very beautiful tune. We can't stay in this room forever. How much longer do we have? Hey, we're gonna be all right. 'Well, this was the beginning of a tragic part of my life. 'When sleep had crept up and mugged me. 'It was my fault. I allowed it. 'My brother had warned me that angels don't sleep. 'So when I awoke I was frightened. 'I had to ask myself, "What am I?" 'And later I found out something much worse. 'Not only was I derelict, 'but I was asleep after their music had called for me. 'It was a velvet sleep, 'more pleasant than looking wide-eyed at galactic forces. 'But the slumber was stupid and dangerous. 'Had my brother not carried me to safety, I might have drowned. 'And if I knew what was to follow I very well might have chosen drowning. 'But that would have been a colossal mistake.' 'When I awoke I felt inside me the flames burning of a thousand stars. 'The egg was nowhere. 'Yet I had a very ignorant dream of finding it 'and little me was dreaming that I'd find it safe.' 'All the fears I once had of the hurricanes and floods, 'of wild animals and flying fish, 'that I should have been most fearful of my own sleep. 'And I vowed that I would never be negligent again. 'And my insides felt like they'd been battered by a flood. 'What remained of me had to face my brother. 'Oh, my brother... he was lenient. 'He should have spanked me with asteroids.' Jonathan, I have a little problem. You are without the egg. 'Damn it. He knew everything.' Angel, you are the fairy of second chances and you failed. But don't despair for I am a fairy of second chances too. 'I waited vigilantly 'but I did wonder if anybody on that planet would ever give an appropriate sign. 'And if I didn't use the egg for good there I would have taken it somewhere else. 'Perhaps a galaxy far, far away. 'But then the man approached deservingly. 'He believed that I was a frail little girl and he ventured out to rescue me.' I've been looking all over for you. You're a hard one to catch. Would you like some oxygen? Frank, I've come to assist you with something important. This world is not the true Earth. Where did you come from? I came from far away to bring you this from another world. I don't know how to explain. You wouldn't believe me anyway. Hey, if I can believe this mess I can believe anything. But my words won't convince you. What use are words? Words didn't prevent the ruined nation. Words won't convince you of my power. Look at me, Frank. I am glowing while everything else withers. Don't wander, take this. It's your chance to shine again. Take care, Frank. Frank? Frank? 'Oh, they would be all right. 'In time they would find out the egg's power. 'Those humans didn't know what they had 'and now it was my turn for a revelation.' Angel, I will say goodbye to you now. You have no need for me to be handing you eggs any longer. Go and grow. Take flight. 'And on some shore of the wide universe, 'my brother stands alone and watches time in the planets race by.'
