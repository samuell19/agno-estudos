You have to live. Somehow. Who is there to live for? She who brought meaning to my life is gone, now whom should I live for? You still get moved to tears when you see others in pain. Plenty of people are dead inside even when they're alive But you are not totally dead yet, Ravi. Ravi Kishore ji, please come in. Go buddy Or else I'll miss my flight. With great difficulty I managed to land this job in Ranikhet. You should get yourself admitted to our mental hospital. Mr. Ravi, you are a danger to yourself. Nobody listens to me. I need to go somewhere else, Doctor. Tell me, if your house is on fire and I try to douse the flames, won't you help me? No, I will pour more petrol onto those flame till the whole house burns down to ashes. I cannot live in that semi-burnt house without my Pooja. Thank you, Doctor Nandini! Careful Nandini!!! What happened, Yogesh? Daddy, I know you will be very worried about me, but I will be back. I will come back. You have to be saved from Gyaan Prakaash and Nandini Maa. She's the disease you need to be saved from Daddy, I love you very much, take care of yourself and I will be back soon. I promise. Oh Lord, she ran away even from the hospital? Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you to stay the night with her? Just one night? Didn't I tell you? Aryaa is right. You are a disease. A disease. Don't say that Yogesh, don't say that. Now stop your drama, stop it. Stop. Stop. I don't know where to look for her now. I don't know what to do, where do I look for her, where.. Shh..calm down, calm down.. ..here, see this. Come Let's go see Bhagwaan. Jai Guruji He alone can get us out of this darkness Protect my child, O Guruji, Jai Guruji Jai Guruji Jai Guruji Yes? Look, I have shut down my business I don't understand why nobody reads the board outside Mindlessly banging on my door in the middle of the night Here, take this What? I made a Booking for Kailash from here. You will find plenty of other drivers in this city Please excuse me. I don't want to talk to you. Call her Whom? The owner of this place... ..who had assured me while taking my booking that.. ..you would take me wherever I needed to go, from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari. Call her, and ask her if she said this or not. Look Then what's the point of making a booking 3 months in advance? You tell me! It's impossible There's one thing you can do. You will find a row of cars parked outside. Just pick any one of them and go, you don't even have to return it. Okay? He's crazy. Do you expect me to drive all the way to Kailash by myself? Call her, please, call her. Didn't I just tell you I can't call her? Now go on, leave. Hey! My bag.. I was all prepared to come to you. Why did you take a booking from this crazy girl? Now keep waiting for me! What is it? I don't want your money And I don't have anyone else to turn to You don't understand, I have certain obligations. What kind of obligations? I can't tell you that, but I really don't have time. Please. Oh, you're running out of time? You've run away from the hospital, right? Wait, I'm going to call the hospital One prick of a needle, and you will be right back there Don't move. If you don't disconnect the call right now, I will cut myself. Go on, what's stopping you? Hello? City Care Hospital? Hello? Are you crazy? You cut yourself? It's your fault You said go ahead so I cut myself But why are you standing there like a statue? Do you want to just stand there and watch me die? No, no! Then do something! Oh ho, this looks like a suicide case. I will have to call the police. Police..police! Why are you calling the Police? Stop the bleeding first I need to notify the police in a suicide case PLEASE Hello, this is Dr. Dastoor. Why do you keep calling this a suicide? Look, she got angry because her father was getting drunk. She tried snatching the bottle away and cut herself. Simple. Is she your daughter? Yes, she's my daughter. Name? Ravi Kishore Not yours, your daughter's Misha. Misha. Misha, Ravi? Misha. Yes, I got it Pooja, Misha Kishore. Nurse, prepare a dressing Nothing happens in the Universe without a purpose. How did she escape from the hospital despite being sedated? Yogesh, this upheaval means the Lord himself is trying to tell us something. Where were you at that time? Be still Rajesh, be still. Let me focus Rajesh, we are all connected through our past lives. Help your brother. I beg you, please help him Look how he's suffering, help him find his daughter. I will find her. I will find her. Yogesh, get a hold on yourself. It is impossible for Aryaa to survive now. She is racing towards her death. One of her own will kill her. Sit here, let me get you some turmeric milk. Thank you. I am sorry, I'm a bit messed up with my problems. it's alright, it's not your fault. Let it be, we can eat something on the way. Can we leave? See, if I don't reach Ranikhet on time, my helicopter bookings will go to waste I will be 21 in 7 days And my mother wanted me to offer worship in Kailash as soon as I turned 21. You have a tattoo of Lord Shiva on your arm, right? She told me If you are going to Kailash, take my husband with you. If he had his way, he would have Shiva tattoos all over his body. But if you don't want to honour your wife's last booking, I can't do much about it. Keep this safely. She had lovely handwriting I'm off POOJA KISHORE I am here Can we leave? Namashkar Pooja Travels and Tours. Service with Security 24/7 is our motto. Have a nice day. Tell me something.. Hm Aren't you scared of death? No, let me finish this last duty. Then, I'm off. Straight up there to my lady Our love story began on these streets, but it will end only up there. Wow! Nowadays people start and end their relationships on Whatsapp. But Vishal also loves me like this Who is Vishal? We will pick him up on our way. On our way? Yes, up ahead But from where? Central Jail What? Who are you? And who are you running away from? You've made a booking for Kailash, but you're going to the jail? Tell me your real story, or I will take you back to the hospital. Why should I tell you? Because you have no option. Wait, I'll tell you. Have you heard of the Desai Group of Industries? I am the only daughter of Shakuntala and Yogesh Desai And the sole heir of Desai Group of Industries. Two years ago, my mother got lung cancer And then she died a year ago But my mother did not die of cancer. My aunt, Nandini, and Gyaan Prakaash together killed my mother. And I am sure about that. Just a week after my mother's death, Nandini married my Dad. And since then, Gyaan's fraud Ashram has been running on my mother's money. What about your father, doesn't he know anything? He himself has become a disciple now He knows nothing, he is too innocent. Why haven't you told this to the police? Because Nandini has had me labelled mentally unstable. They all think I am hallucinating. Nobody believes what I say. Do you know they wanted to give me shock therapy? This is my story. And how did your criminal boyfriend land up in your story? Just like a Hindi film hero! With a song on his lips Thank you! Amazing! But it is not necessary for a great artist to be a good human being. I will come straight to the point. For the last few months, you have been continuously abusing me on my 'India Fights Fake Gurus' account. Why? What is your problem? You, and affluent people like you, who sit in your AC rooms and think you can rescue the country from the chains of blind faith Arrey, you people are more dangerous than these fake Babas and Gurus You're doing this for publicity and to increase your followers. You're the fake. We all look at the world from our own points of view I have lost one of my own because of these fake gurus Here, meet my friend Naina Das She went to learn meditation from a Baba, and ended up being molested by him This cause is my life. Now apologise for badmouthing me earlier ..in public. Otherwise, face the music. The point I am trying to make is, we can make fools of ourselves much more easily than others can make fools out of us. To these fake Gurus our suffering is a gold mine. Every morning when the sun rises, it shines equally on both the rich and the poor. But Gyaan Prakaash claims that only he can hear God's voice. What kind of God talks only to him and not to us? We want His contact too, we want to talk to Him too. Please speak to us too. Yes? I have come to apologise. What I did was wrong. I did not know your story, please forgive me. Like you I too have lost a lot. My grandfather came under the spell of a Guru, and signed off our ancestral property to him. And that Guru sold it all, and flew off to settle abroad. We were ruined. I have hated these fake Babas ever since. I want to join your Cause, I want to make a difference. I understand. So come, join our army of one lakh ninety six thousand followers. Welcome to the gang. India Fights Fake Gurus, please contact us Sir. Ma'am, India Fights Fake Gurus, just contact us. Thank you Ma'am, India Fights Fake Gurus, just contact us. Just contact us. Just contact us. Please contact us Aryaa your words are always on my mind. My words or me? Can I ask you something? Hm? Aryaa, don't you think it's a waste of time to keep distributing handbills in this digital age? Vishal, there's a whole universe outside social media too. You know that, right? We have to escape from this darkness together, all of us My heart says that one day these handbills will lead us to that one person who knows of Gyaan Prakaash's criminal activities and who will be willing to testify against him. Here, what are you gaping like that for? God is on our side, here on the streets, now get out! Back to work, guys. Aryaa, I worry about you. Don't be scared, Vishal. What do you mean, don't be scared? Those who bark, don't bite. It's okay. Vishal? Vishal? A man came and gave me this address And asked us both to be there at ten, He said there's a girl who wants to testify against Gyaan Prakaash. Are you serious? Oh my God, Vishal! We.. we were supposed to meet a girl at ten. Lets go Thank you. Vishal, stop drinking. Arrey chill naa. What kind of a place is this? Hello? Hello? You, get out, get out! What's going on? Vishal..Vishal? Vishal? Vishal? Vishal? Who are you? Aah.. No Vishal, he's dead.. But this seems to be a case of self-defence, then why is he in jail? Because Nandini and Gyaan Prakaash are very well connected with the Police bigwigs. Vishal was drinking that night, They got him on those grounds. They threatened all our Activists into silence, and then came after me. But as soon as I turn 21, I become the head of Desai Group of industries according to my mother's will. And thereafter she won't even be able to swipe a credit card without my permission. Just let Vishal and me reach Kailash, then see how, with God's blessing, we go after them. So young, yet so brave! Don't you feel scared? Yes I do, but my mother used to say, real courage is when you persist despite the fear. Should we leave? Please! Vishal! Ohh Kumbhkaran! Kumbhkaran? Hello Kumbhkaran? I've heard so much about you. Where's Gaurav by the way? I couldn't get in touch with him, Vishal, and I had to throw away my phone so that they can't track me. But why didn't he come? I don't know, we can call him on the way. We should leave, there are too many cameras around. Come! Okay. Driver Saab, please look after him, this is my son, Kumbhkaran. He sleeps all day... and all night too He was injured, we'll leave him in the forest. Kumbhkaran, something is not quite right with your Father. What? Let's take another cab, man! No. Aryaa, I cannot go from one jail straight into another, - What do you mean No? - Yes, please, I am a little old fashioned, please take another taxi. - Yes. - No no, no, we want to go with you. Please let's go. Hello, Pooja Travels and Tours. Service with Security 24/7 is our motto, have a nice day. Vishal you know he is suicidal? He feels that if he kills himself he will be reunited with his dead wife. He still loves her intensely. Are you serious? That's insane. Aryaa, on one hand we are fighting against blind faith and yet you're encouraging this kind of thinking? You are sympathising with this nonsense? Can we just please get another cab? Oh God God knows when with a twist of his steering wheel he will decide to go meet his wife and take us along. Vishal, so what are you saying? We leave him here? Yes, why? Is he family? Okay Vishal, you don't know this, okay? If he wanted he could have handed me over to the Police He didn't do it, he knows everything about me and he understands me. I don't know why the heart does what it does but I trust him, like I trust Daddy and I trust you. I don't want to get another cab. -Whatever What? Nothing Okay, you sulk while I go change. Munna? Jai Guruji! He hasn't touched even a grain of rice since she disappeared. And look at her! What is she doing in the middle of the road? Even if you manage to find her, don't bring her home. She cannot be the blood of such a noble man. Nandini! What is wrong with you? You're just saying whatever you feel like. I knew this video would make you two uncomfortable. When our daughters disrespect our culture like this, and take to the streets in this manner, it makes our blood boil. But what I am going to tell you now will make it clear that our Lord indeed is privy to divine instruction. My informer has just told me that this boy, Vishal, whom Aryaa considers to be a hero, is no hero at all.. In fact, he's a close accomplice of the gangster Dilip Hathkataa, and is now escaping with Aryaa in a taxi. We've got the details of the taxi and its driver, but I have no idea where this boy is taking Aryaa. But this can't be Dilip's doing.. Then who is instigating this scoundrel? I don't have an answer to that now, but most certainly this is the guy who, as our Lord warned us, will be responsible for Aryaa's death. Can I ask you something? Yes, of course. What happened to her? Years ago, we prematurely lost a baby whom we had decided to call Misha. Last year we decided to adopt a baby girl. Three months back, she came and told me that the Adoption Centre had asked us to come collect our Misha. I've never refused her anything. God knows what happened to me that day I said, you go, I will get the house ready for her. Twenty minutes later, the phone rang. She had met with a fatal accident. Why didn't I die instead of her? Ravi, the truth is, despite all our attempts, sometimes it is impossible for us to stop those we love from leaving us. Even I couldn't save my mother. Please stop feeling guilty, it was an accident. Here's some good news for you! In a very short time, we will be parting ways. Then you can go your way, and we will go ours. - Vishal? - This is final Aryaa. There are too many rules to follow with him, I can't do it.. And let me be honest.. After what you told me, about him, I don't feel safe. Okay? So sorry. I am sorry I've spoken with Gaurav, he's getting us another taxi. So we'll carry on, Sir? My friend is waiting for us. Can you give me your phone so I can set the location on your GPS? I don't need a machine to tell me the location. Tell me the address, I'll take you there. There's Gaurav! Here we are.. Bro, how have you been? Where were you man? I am very sorry for Vishal's behavior. No, it's okay. I thought if I went with you, I would reach Kailash. But I suppose one can only reach Him when He calls one. But thank you, I feel lighter after talking to you. I want to say something to you. Sure, go ahead This body - it belongs to Him. You have no right to harm it, okay? Ravi ji, this world needs more human beings like you, not Godmen like Gyaan Prakaash. Aryaa? What? - What are you doing? - I am coming. Let's go! Please take care of yourself, okay? Thank you. Okay, bye. You've gone mad. - What? - You've lost it. Let's go guys. Why is your taxi parked over there? Some problem. What problem? - Why were you so rude? - I was rude, or he was rude? Please, please, please. What a guy! How did you find him? Did you see the sign in his car? Vishal! Vishal? - Let me go! - What is this Gaurav? Who are these people? Sorry yaar guys. Gaurav! I will attend to you later. First, let me finish her off. My name is Dilip Hathkataa, do you know the story of my hand? Once Guruji gave me a task, and I failed. I hated myself so much for failing, that I cut off my hand and placed it at Guruji's feet. Now it's our turn to post your photo on the internet. One before offering you to the fire, one after. You can set me on fire but you can't douse the fire which we've lit in people's hearts. Let Nandini and your fraud Guru know this. Let's offer you to the fire now Hey, now pour petrol on her. Get my mobile. Go Kumbhkaran, it's time you showed what you can do. Kartaar, get rid of this beast. Chase it away. What are you waiting for? Get rid of it. And who's he? Throw him out. Hey you, get out! Hold it, where's this guy's other hand? He uses this one hand for everything? Should I shoot you? Should I? Why don't you? Shoot! Shoot! Untie them. Kumbhkaran, handle this. Ravi, why are you doing all this? After all, I am just a passenger. How will I face my beloved up there if you get even a single scratch on you? As long as I am here, nobody can harm you. Whether it's an outsider, or an insider. Service with Security 24/7, we'll spend the night close by, okay? Vishal! What happened? Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - Wait, give me a hug. Come here. Aah..ughh.. Vishal, you scared me! Come, lie down. What happened? Aryaa.. What? Say something please, I ummm Aryaa, I am not Vishal. You are not Vishal? Then? Who are you? Munna.. Munna Chavan. After winning a reality show, I came to Mumbai to become a star but ended up becoming a drug addict. Hello? What happened, Sir? Are you ok? I'm okay bro Sir? If Gyaan's followers hadn't picked me up from the streets, I would have died. Pick him up, pick him up Jai Guru ji, Jai Guru ji I was reborn in Gyaan's Ashram. You've given me a new life. From this moment, every drop of my blood is yours. Be patient, you will get your chance to be of service to me. Come here.. And then, one night I got my chance. So Gyaan Prakaash, your days are numbered, we are coming to burn down your Lanka. Didn't that make your blood boil? Of course. Then stand by us. We want to bathe our Lord's pure feet with her blood. And for this, we need your help Just use your beautiful, innocent face to trap her. Then his men will take over. That night, I was all set to kill you. But I fell in love with you the very first time I saw you. Every morning when the sun rises, it shines equally on both the rich and the poor. But Gyaan Prakaash claims that only he can hear God's voice. What kind of God talks only to him and not us? Your innocent questions turned the image of the Lord into ashes inside me. That was the most beautiful morning of my life. I was about to confess everything to you when the bell rang.. So how's the romance blooming? Sir, I won't be able to do it. Why? Have you fallen in love with her? But you are misunderstanding us. Do you think we will kill our daughters? You just bring her to this address, that's all One of my lady officers will talk to her, explain the consequences of her actions, and then let her go. Then you two can continue your romance! That night, by saving you, I became Gyaan Prakaash's lifelong enemy. Sooner or later, they will kill me. And I am ready to die, but I had to tell you the truth Aryaa. It takes two to make a truth. One who can tell it, and one who can bear it. He has confessed his truth, now what will you do? We don't let go of those close to us even after getting to know the worst about them. He had come to kill you, but now his own life is in danger I had heard that love can turn even garbage into gold. Today I have seen it with my own eyes. Do something. Either hold him close and forgive him. Or, take the gun, and shoot him. Because this bond between you can't be erased by pressing a delete button. Aryaa, say something. Your silence is unbearable Aryaa, please say something. Just kill me. Kill you? How brave, Vishal! Vishal, it takes courage to live, not die. Didn't you hear what he just said? You had come to kill me, but what did God do? He made you fall in love with me. Why? Because my cause is true, and so is my love. And you want me to kill my true love? Do you remember what you told me the first time you came to apologize to me? That I want to make a difference. Then make a difference! You fool, don't you see it? You are the witness who can bring Gyaan Prakaash down. You can make us win Vishal!.. What? You still love me, Aryaa? Yes, I love you, and you know what? I will love you till the very end, because now I alone have a right over you. Fool, come here. I love you, Aryaa. I love you too. Ravi, you have grown attached to this child. You are seeing your Misha in her. Ravi, this is too big a game for you, my friend. This is out of your league now. I could not save Pooja, how do I abandon this child? You want to save her, right? Now listen to me, she is suspicious about her step mother right? Not her father, right? MISSING You just lie to them, and bring them here somehow. Then call the poor father, and ask him to pick up his child. Does that sound good? Take down this number. Hello? Coffee? Ravi? Take the number. Hello? Namastey, Sir. Namastey, who's speaking? Sir, I need to tell you something about your daughter Aryaa Aryaa..yes, tell me? Please pay full attention, and note down this address. One second. What have you done to yourself? Why this pistol? We need this now Yogesh, we need this now. What? We make our plans down here, but He has his own Super Plan for us. All the sins began with me. I used to be so jealous of Shakuntala. It started with stealing her lipsticks and make up, until one day, I stole you from her. To tell you the truth, Yogesh.. Guruji had instigated me to push you to kill Shakuntala. But despite committing this sin, I got no satisfaction.. See how he has made our child a roadblock on our path God knows how she found out that I killed her mother. I am the only path through which Yes, hello, Rajesh bhai? Yes, I had called you. I've got Aryaa's address - Yogesh, - I'm sending it to you. I overheard your conversation with that taxi driver And yet you're giving Rajesh Aryaa's address? Don't you want to bring her home? No What? I am not interested in bringing Aryaa back home. Yogesh, come back to your senses God is giving us a chance to redeem our sins through this taxi driver. Tell me something. When your sweet sister was howling in pain, was He able to give her any relief? Hmm? Did you hear any voice from above? No, right? How will you hear a voice when there is no one up there? Huh? For me, God died when I was a child And along with that went ideas of Good, Bad, all of it. What remained was the hunger to become the world's most powerful man. The world only bows to power, Nandini, right? When you introduced me to Gyaan, I realised that there's no greater business on this earth than the God business . Spin a web of words, make promises in this lifetime, and assure their fulfillment in the next. There's no business like the God business. Jai Guruji! And yes, Gyaan provoked you to kill Shakuntala only when I asked him to do so So I was only a means to an end for you? Of course, just like your sister and every other human being on earth. Man cannot own up to the truth that he loves himself and himself alone. Let's get back to the point. If Aryaa stays alive, she will ruin everything we've achieved so far. Now you need to decide if you are on my side or not. You are a demon, a demon! I will not let you kill my child. Sunil.. Sunil..Sunil shoot him, shoot him! He will kill Aryaa, Sunil! Shoot him.. shoot him, he will kill Aryaa. No! no! Sunil? No! no! Aryaa..Aryaa!! Where have we come? Hmm? My friend John works here It's your birthday tomorrow, right? We can rest here for the night and start off tomorrow. John! What happened? Sir? Pooja. She's stopping us from going inside. But Ravi ji, I can't see anyone over there. I have seen her. Hold this gun and shoot only when I tell you to. - But Sir.. - But why should he shoot? And whom will he shoot? You are tired, let's rest here for a while. Yes Sir, Aryaa is right, you are tired.. Now you two stop playing doctor-doctor! I take orders only from my Pooja. Now come on, take the side entry. Go. John? What was that? Don't know yaa He saw his wife. John? Did you hear that? Brother, stop it! Stop it now Brother, stop it! Guruji says if we can achieve our ends through gentle means, we shouldn't resort to violence Otherwise, what's the difference between us and the rest of the world ? Who's that? Rajesh! Jai Guru ji. Listen, we have nothing against you two We are here to simply follow the instructions of our Guru. Now tell us where Aryaa is. Spit it out. If you don't, I will shoot. Should I be killed? Or set free? What is to be done with me?.. Phew! What kind of a man is this? You pull a gun on him and he starts singing! But what about his friend? Don't worry about me Ravi, - don't say a word.. - Shut up. Listen, I will ask one last time After that, I will kill him Tell us where the two of them are. Where is Aryaa? Spit it out, or I will kill him. Shoot..come on Shoot.. Shoot, I say! Jai Guruji Aryaa!!! Vishal... Vishal! Sorry How did they come to know that we are here? I was the one who phoned, for your safety, I am sorry. How was I to know that in this Kalyug children can't trust their own fathers? What? Wha...What is he saying? I am the only path through which humanity will benefit.. To protect me is to protect life, I am love, an ocean of love. Jai Guruji. Nandini's last rites are being performed. Is the Aryaa job done? Daddy? I love you Pooja.. I love you.. Ravi, let's take the kids and leave this place. Ravi? Remember, you said I will have to live, somehow? Remember? Yes And you also said that I am not meant to die such a death? Yes, Pooja too wants the same thing I kept wondering... In this big city, why did this child come knocking on my door, of all places Do you know why? Because I had to live for this moment Now Pooja will have to wait, because I have to live for this child. Will you do something for me? What, Ravi? Ram Naam Satya Hai. What? Ram Naam Satya Hai. Yogesh, even if Aryaa knows the truth now, how does it matter? Who will believe that mentally ill girl? But the screenplay we had written together in which Nandini was supposed to be the villain has been ruined by you. What's done is done, Gyaan. Now we have to set up a new villain on whom we can pin Aryaa's murder. I am worried about that taxi driver, what if he blurts out the truth? So? So what, Gyaan? Anyone can tell the truth But only we can fool the whole world with a lie cunningly disguised as truth. Breaking news. Joint Commissioner Rajesh Puri, who was investigating the Aryaa Desai kidnap case, has gone missing. According to Aryaa Desai's father, Yogesh, she was kidnapped recently The police has filed a case against Ravi Kishore and Munna Chavan in this matter. And here's what Aryaa's father Yogesh Desai has to say about the case. That boy is a criminal He and his taxi driver called me a while ago, demanding 20 crores as ransom for my daughter. Now it's up to you whether you want to trust a father, or a couple of criminals. But the truth will triumph in the end. Jai Guruji. Umm.. Do you want coffee? Hmm? Phone. I need your phone. I am the only path through which humanity will be served. Hello? Thank you, Daddy, thank you so much. What a father you are! Please don't disconnect the phone. Don't be a coward. I marvel at you! You've changed the whole meaning of fatherhood. What a strange world it is, where fathers have to kill their daughters. And for what? For Money? For power? You could have asked for it all, Daddy. I would have given it to you. I always thought that at least your family is your own. Which is why I left home to seek revenge on Nandini Maa. How could I know that my own blood is tainted, that my own father wants me killed? And what will you do with all the money? Do you too plan to remain immortal like your Guru? The world will have to know the truth, because what you are trying to tell the world is nothing but lies. You have killed both my mothers. Don't think that I will do nothing about this because you are my father. Don't think I am broken and crushed. I haven't given up. I will destroy you completely. Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday Dear Misha, Happy Birthday to you. Is everything alright? Have I walked into the wrong house? You idiot, I wanted to give the kids a surprise, but you spoiled it. Did you get the name written correctly on the cake? Yes, of course. I followed everything you said to the T. Come on kids, it's party time! Come on! My new life begins today. And in this life, all I need is Vishal and you by my side. If you had not been there.. Thank you! Ravi, you remember you used to say that you are master of the journey before it starts.. ..but once it starts, it's the journey that becomes the master. Look how this journey made you a father! Now swear on God and make this world as clean as a fairytale for these kids. Who's this bugger? Hey, get out! Nobody died here. Now they will! Hmm? Ok, Guruji's chartered is ready, Sir. Hmm Why are you staring at me? Nothing new happens in this world. Even Arjun had to disguise himself as Brihannala. We have security. Om, take him to the airport through the back roads, okay? I will be there soon. Guruji! Hey, who are you? Who sent you here? What are you doing here? I am His messenger, I have been sent by Him. You all have made a mess of things here. Now you will have to answer to Him. Are you crazy? Get lost, or get ready to die. Heaven! Heaven is opening its doors for me. But before I go there, I will finish you all. Ram Naam Satya Hai. Ram Naam Satya Hai. Prashant? Satish? Anyone there? Can you hear me? Ram Naam Satya Hai Ram Naam Satya Hai Ram Naam Satya Hai Ram Naam Satya Hai Ram Naam.. Ram Naam Satya Hai Did hearing the name of Lord Ram send you running to hide in darkness Bhagwaan ji? Where are you? Die! Die! Die! I..I..don't kill me..don't.. Ram Naam Satya Hai. Ram Naam Satya Hai Ravi.. Ravi, wake up, we have to save Misha, Ravi? Why do you want to kill me? Why? That crazy girl Aryaa has sent you, right? To kill her own father? How much money did she give you? How much? Huh? I will give you much more, how much do you want? How much? Tell me How much do you want? How much more? How much? Pooja Travels and Tours. Service with Security. My Misha will not die again. No, no, please, I have made a grave mistake. I have made a grave mistake. I fell under the influence of my Guru, and committed a grave sin. What I did to Aryaa --forgive me, I made a mistake Just let me pay homage one last time, Then I will do whatever you ask me to, whatever. Just once, please, let me offer homage just once? No no.. you can't die until you hear me out! Just tell me, why did you do all this? Huh? For love, and God? I wonder who spread the rumor that love and God exist! From darkness we come, and to darkness we shall return There's no sin, or goodness. There's no heaven, or hell There's no one up there. And if there is a God, it is I. Har Har Mahadev! Ravi, lets go! The stranger who gave his life to save mine was no murderer, he was my savior. That stranger saved me from my own father, that father who first killed my mother to grab her wealth, and then, with the help of Gyaan Prakaash and his so-called army, tried to kill me too. He is a witness to that. A country doesn't change overnight. Bringing electricity to every corner of the country will not wipe out darkness. We will have to join hands to fight against blind faith, as one. I request the Government to take action against those who have exploited innocent people in the name of God, and driven them to wrong practices. Those who have turned God into a business. One more thing, I want to let the body of Yogesh Desai rot in the government morgue. Because I will perform the last rites for Ravi Kishore only. This journey has made one thing clear to me. Fatherhood is an emotion. Ravi Kishore is the father I never had. Thank you, thank you. Om Namah Shivaye Om Namah Shivaye Om Namah Shivaye Misha?
