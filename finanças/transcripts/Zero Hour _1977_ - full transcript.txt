Zero Hour July 1945. The IIIrd Reich has been defeated for eight weeks. In exchange for the West section of Berlin, the Americans give up Thuringia and Saxony, won from the Soviet Union at the end of the war. The inhabitants are waiting for their second liberation. I spit on the squadron commander! Pennsylvania! California! I spit on the squadron commander! You've won the war. You were better nourished, you had better weapons, better logistics, but admit our aviation was well over yours. We had Stuka, I spit on the squadron commander!. On certain nights our pilots brought down 80 of yours. Our secret weapons were hardly used. V1, V2... OK, bye. Captain Schluesselmacher? - Can I tell you something? - Please. Doenitz's offer... You should have taken it. That's bullshit! Germans and Americans. With your organization' and your stuff and our combat experience against bolshevism ... I'd have given the Russians 14 days... Listen to me carefully! What was left from my family in Germany was massacred by you Nazi. Get lost! Is that New York? I know where a treasure is buried in Leipzig. And this cord here... is the key to i t. Do you need the grenade? Take it. I'm giving it to you. What are you doing here? Can I have a little water? When will they be arriving? I don't know, but I have this for you. Put it on your door, so that everyone passing by can read it. We won't get to that point. Stalin likes little people. "Citizens of Leipzig! Under the American occupation, the Nazi are coming back. They are allowed to lie and wage propaganda campaigns. They pretend that that the Red Army, in the occupied territories, steals, robs and kills. That is an odious lie! Ever since the retreat of the American army of the Americans, the Red Army is in front of your city's gates. Don't listen the Nazi lies..." Where do you think you are? You bum! "There will be food and briquette distribution. To those of good will, we'll extend our friendship. Don't be afraid. The... anti-fascist tomity." It's really nice around here. So? What's that to you? How is it called? Leipzig-Gohlis. Here's the switch post number 25 and, back there, the graveyard. That's all there is. You've got guts. Why? D'you want to get killed? Since May, they haven't killed anyone. I'd love some coffee. Coffee! There's Konig Cafe and Schmoerlemeier Cafe. They are open and are only waiting for your sugar rations. If they ever see this... a true barricade. Who's "they"? Who do you think?... The Russians. The Russians, the Russians... What do you know about the Russians? I have seen your like, guarding the waste water plant. And the only thing they did, was flushing the toilets! Can you read? Hey! Isa! Where did you get the bread? This morning, the Yankees forgot a food storehouse. It surely smells nice. Aunt Grete! I got American bread! It smelt so nice, I almost eat it all on the road. Here, touch it. It feels so nice. I ate a bit, a tiny bit. You made me worried sick! What if the Russians had got you? Look how greedy Paul is! Go spread the manure! Right away. Come on, let's go back together. We'll have some really thick butter sandwich. You'll eat when you'll have finished your work! Get back on your scooter and get out of here. Recently, some guys from Banat, deserters, like you... they had put into their heads to gobble up our gooseberry during the night. Bad idea. They had the right to a kangaroo court. We've gotten tired with this kind of stuff. Consider yourself warned. Listen... are you a railwayman, or a bicycle merchantman? You snotty bastard! This is about food stuff, about briquettes, and the good will of those you'll stretch your hand to. You can't find that just with the snap of the finger. Listen... Food and briquettes when they don't have anything. You're making me laugh! I'm telling you: my ass they'll give you something to eat! Ask one of our German soldiers. Now that they've been brought down a peg or two, they'll tell you. If these hygiene freaks suspect typhus, they'll go around a long way to avoid this place. Put the basin down. Must be careful with the gall. if it spreads, it'll wreck everything. Show me your chew. - Where's the dog? - Dead. The old woman wasted it three days ago. It was sick. And she sold the meat, I know it for sure. But, when Stalin's armies will be here, I'll go in the barn to see how they treat the women. He does what, Stalin? This! And he puts his heart into it! Don't you say! The nurse girl is a little gone. She stays for hours in the shithouse howling like someone was flaying her: "Mummy! Bombs!" She's not the only one having gone through shelling. I can hardly wait for these Russians to come. Just to put some people in their place. We'll at last have some justice. And me! I'll watch them do the broads That I'll do. Don't hang around here! I've told you one hundred times! You have no business being here! Just wait I tell your mother. I'll show you, whistling in a graveyard! Can I stay here tonight? Have to think about it. It's already better. Even better. Hello? Yes. We've had to cases of typhus. No, nothing serious. Can you make a detour? You don't have to. Wroclaw, would be alright? Fine. Send my best to Joseph Stalin. He shouldn't be too disappointed he didn't end up with Saxony. "Send my best to Joseph Stalin"? He won't have too many friends around here! Where are you coming from? From Plauen. I crossed the American lines. And the BMW outside? I stole it from a peasant. Do you know why I like the Americans? - No, why? - They look smart. Their pants and their shirts have a well defined pleat. - So what? - So, they look smart. Have you ever heard of Saint-Louis blues? What's that? You don't know?! Don't you have a radio or what? Where would you want me to find a radio? Look at this fool. - He feel asleep. - Is he mad? I thought so two minutes ago. It's the heat. It's becoming unbearable. We're used to another climate. Where did you go see heat wave, besides Leipzig? I was in Greece, if you can remember. Here, have a Lucky Strike. I can tell you that, when I was in the tanks, in Arcadia... Well, just on the eve of Christmas, We fried eggs on the armoring. Yes, my dear sir. The Yanks, have red gasoline. Can you imagine that? Red gasoline! You'd say raspberry syrup. And tin cans that can take half a turkey. With feathers. Such stuff, dear sir. And they don't smoke their cigarettes up to the stump, like we do. No. They only smoke them up to the middle. That's how they do it. When I was repatriated, because of my injured leg, we had been eating in the cave ever since the end of '43. 289 air-raid alerts. I put down everything on the cave's door. The hour, the date, the length Everything is written down. I drilled a hole through Bergwein cave's wall. 20 centimeters thick. Just like that, with my arms. It was nice living in the cave. We all sat there. There was no animosity. And the kids... They behaved so well. When the English went away, to Berlin or Eisenach, we were able to breathe. Bergwein painted watercolors. Some cows... with bells hanging from their necks. We were going along fine. That's funny... Now, there's peace. I almost miss those chats. And outside, everything crumbled. We had never been hit hard. Until that night, just before the end, when everything finished. Bergwein's kids were killed. I took all my stuff and came here. I've never left since. At the end of '33, there were lots of us who thought the specter of Nazism would have soon disappeared. We only gave Hitler a couple of weeks. But the syndicate leader of the Railwaymen Association, Hans Jahn, had no illusions. He knew what was in store for us if the Nazi came to power. So, in the winter of '32, we simulated an alert in order to evaluate the time we needed for starting a general strike. In other words, how much time did the railwaymen need to paralyze the railway network? Signaling, shunts, the engine drivers and the freight trains, too, if a Nazi offensive took place. I can tell you it was a total success. In a couple of hours only, we blocked all the trains. We said: "Today, we shout. "Tomorrow, we hit." And then? Nothing. The big shots vetoed it. They wouldn't go along, having put their blind trust in the government. - And then? - When Hitler came? It wasn't something that depended on 50 railwaymen in Saxony. It went all the way to Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Spain, even! You know... in Greece, there was a town called Kalavrita. We had to sort things out so we, at last, would have calm and peace. Everyone of us had received a square, white house, and a wine barrel. Everything went smoothly until the day when... Night had fallen And it smelled like... I can't say. We were going around without our uniforms. Then, we got shot by concealed snipers. The scum! We were all hit. I found myself without a leg. Bullshit. 8h:30. Power came back. You've at last found what you wanted. I didn't kill anyone. Anyone. At least, anyone I know of. The girl, I built a hiding place for her. For when the Russians would come. Do you believe in briquettes? I'd lose my sleep if I didn't. My cord! There wasn't anyone, so I took it. Tell me everything, as you promised. - This is Arabia. - Looks big. Yes, it is. Really big. Tell me a story. An adventure story. Every day at noon, a sandstorm begins. Exactly at noon the sky darkens as if it was night. And these storms sweep the land. You should consider yourself lucky to be living here. Does it stop? Yes. It goes on for about an hour and then it brightens. What do they eat? They eat mutton. They don't eat pork, because pigs roam through garbage. They also have rice, beautiful yellow rice. And dates. And, above everything else, there's pudding every day there. They invented it two hundred years ago. Tell me, were you aware? I've never eaten dates, nor leg of lamb. Stop it, already... I'd rather not think about it. If only I had one here, a well roasted leg of lamb... Not during a storm. Otherwise you'd be eating the Arabian desert. Take this, kid. A cup of warm malt coffee. Thank you. - Have you got typhus? - Why? Oh, your leaflet... They say typhus, is always better than you. It smells of coffee! Say... d'you think Russian soldiers are idiots? - Well... - Don't interrupt me! For one, they don't understand our language. And then... who do you think you are? I know what you are. A propaganda peddler. You are one of those described in here. I should have seen right away you were an informer, even a spy for the Yanks. The jacket! The jacket! Look at this jacket. And you accommodate such lowlife! You are beginning to smell trouble. My advice for you is to scram. Things will change. Slow down! How do you know it's true about the coal? How do I know? I just know it. The anti-fascist committee knows it. By the way, if you want a red flag everything is ready. Why would I want a red flag for? Why? You are asking me that? To salute, of course! To wave it! When our liberators arrive. Thank you, Mr. Franke. I've already been liberated. We've been liberated for some time. We won't be liberated until the red flag doesn't flow everywhere. Mind my words! Do you believe in God? No. I knew it. Only an atheist would bawl on a Sunday. Will you let me have your party badge? You don't need it any more in the anti-fascist committee. I've been watching you for some time. You've been watching me since 1933. It's not about that. I really want your badge. You've only got it four months ago. When I named my roosters Joseph, Adolf and Hermann, you went to the police. And when Richard's letter came, without even knowing if he was dead, you put your arm around me and said: "May the certainty that your son dedicated his life to the Führer console you through the pain that afflicts you." You said that. In those times times, you were wearing the eagle on your jacket, I saw you! And what happened to the little mustache? You sacrificed it too on the eighth of May? You jerk! He used to hand out the food coupons like if the Führer himself had personally given them to him. He fulminated and got mad if you didn't salute him with "Heil Hitler!". I was forced to. I had superiors. I had problems too. Problems?! You, problems!? You've never had any. Not then, and not know! You are again beginning to mock us. First"Heil Hitler!", then "Red Front". Our most eager anti-fascist committee recruit. Don't make me laugh! When the Yanks came, you waved three white flags and now you're unfolding a red sheet. Three days ago he came to see me: "Dear Mrs.Unterstab! The new government will assuredly entrust you, with the up-keeping of the graveyard." Do you know what he wanted? Something to eat! This infidel! Always prowling around my rabbits' cages! Then, he gives me a bucket with coal, token of friendship... And I packed him a thigh. I really did! He thought he was eating one of my Flanders giants. D'you know what it was? A bit from my dog's thigh! He died from canine de la parvovirus. And besides that, he also had worms and scabies. Mangy dog for the first communist in our village! What are you looking for by the graveyard? Nothing. What would I look for there? That's funny. Him, I can understand. But you and this Franke you prowl around there as if you were looking for something. I'll go take a walk. A man sang in the woods They have guns And then There is what to drink And, all this time, We were drinking like a hole And the hole got bigger and bigger And the bottles got empty And we started crying In the wine vapors Our watches look at one another Everything alright? This morning, in Weissenfels, I climbed a little hill. I saw the beautiful German land destroyed. Where are the fascists? I looked around. Nothing. Now, I can do business with the Germans. There're some decent blokes here. You can see this right away You really are ogling him! - Nonsense... - Admit it. Ogling someone it's not bad. Grass everywhere. Like back home. Not I. - Not you? - No. I don't eat too much. Are you hungry? Yes, I'm hungry. I'm always hungry. With the old woman there isn't much to eat. D'you want it? - Can I take it? - You can. - It does you good. - Can't say no to that. Why do you go on staying with the old woman? What do you want me to do? I've been there for... let me see... I've been there for an year. And then, I sleep here, I live here. I have what to live on, and then... what else can I do? Where can I go with the mad foot I have? And your head, is it mad too? The head is alright. First drink. Then think. Yesterday is not all there is. Today is important. And tomorrow. Come with Motek. I can't leave. Why? Are you married to that? - No, I'm not married, but... - Well, then...? I have a horse. You love horses. I have a carousel. You're looking for work. There. "Railwaymen, hold on! " Are you nuts? Hide that! - Why are you afraid of? - Stop snooping around! The war is over. Listen to me carefully. Times ago, there was a signal, here, down there. Trains would stop for two, or three minutes. And the leaflets were printed in Amsterdam. When the train came, I'd take a bundle and spread it around. When trains stopped at the signal. It was hidden in the airing pipe, under the toilets' window or between the partition walls. And this... was my secret weapon. This key. Show me. It's only tracks, nothing more. Yes, that's how it looks, but... Everything going through here went to Kiel, Dantzig, Wroclaw, Wuerzburg, Nuremberg, Ingolstadt... And you were doing all that by yourself? No! I had contacts everywhere. All the way to Spain I had them! When we realized, back then, in 1935, that the material for the Franquists was transiting through Dresden disguised as lignite, we contacted our comrades in Spain. Contacts everywhere in the world. - Without setting foot outside the house? - Absolutely. Look at this bench. We'd sit there and talk. High treason talk? Troop movements, armament, centralization of equipment, workers' moral, organization, everything mattered! You are a real human torpedo! Heroic dead men don't exist! Surviving it's what matters! - Mattiske. - Yes? My mother has a flat tire. If you fix it, she'll give you carrot juice. Give it to me. Hey, you! I think she's interested in you. She said: "The one with the winner's jacket." What could you know? She said right now that she could leave tonight! - Just wait! - Are you happy about the Russians? Why? At last, we'll be having entertainment again. She said you should go see her. Should have said that. Won't you go? Of course I will. Shall we walk a little along the track? When I was in the war, I had some girlfriends. - You were in the war?! - Not for long. Where were you? In Greece. We razed everything back there. In Greece?! If I tell you. And, imagine, at Christmas we... ...fried eggs on the armoring. How do you that? Paul always tells this story. Oh well... Yes. - D'you know jazz? - No. Listen. - D'you like the Americans? - They're alright. I know everything about them. D'you know what I like about them? What? They smell nice. They don't resole their shoes. Once bust, they buy new ones. A regular waste, can't even imagine it! Damn! And the radio stays on all day long. Nice jacket. It's a pilot jacket. Kid skin. Feel it. It smells... - D'you live around here? - Yes. I came from Munich. I'm staying with my aunt. - D'you know what it means? - No. Why have you come here? - Got something I have to do. - And then, you'll be leaving? I'll go back to the Yanks. Schluesselmacher will adopt me. They do that in America. There's nothing left here. Here, everywhere you look, ruins... But there... I saw photos in the captain's tent. Wild horses, big avenues, a joint every street corner. They have so much food that... that... they only bite once from a chicken thigh. I swear. I saw it. And, listen, it's paradise. If it's so good, what are you still doing here? There's something I have to cake of. You wouldn't understand. And then I'll go see my grandparents and I go to the Yanks. I'd have loved being a pilot, saving people. Who would you have liked to save? Well, those in need. You come in your plane, you see the smoke and then you talk through your radio. I would have liked being saved. That too isn't bad. You have to parachute yourself above a field, where people gather potatoes. Your cheek is wounded, you hobble. Because you've twisted your ankle. They dress your wound, they give you a tap on the shoulder... Will you take me to the Americans? What if the Russians come? They don't scare me. Besides... I'm armed. It takes your knees out. But it's forbidden. So what? I'm an exception. An exception! Right after the armistice, a guy fired a bazooka into a jeep. Three Americans killed. They executed him. He wasn't older than you. We were all forced to watch. Youngster! Have you been in combat? Yes! My Richard fought too. He got not far from Moscow. Have you really fought? Well, not really, but it was going to happen. There's lots of empty houses around here! Don't you even think about pilfering! I've got my eyes on you. I'm warning you! I bet she's all for snooping. Look. Is it yours? I took my wages for six years' work on the fields, with a German gentleman. A ruddy short bloke. He almost looked like... a two-legged sow. The owner's wife used to say that old Poles had a venereal disease. All of them! And the carousel? Ah! The carousel? I got to a German barrack. Well, everything had been destroyed and the Fascists had left... And there was lying my little carousel... the sole survivor of the Wermacht's rout. Alright, but why here? Why?! For business, of course! What else for?! But here... Why here? Why not? Everyone took refuge in the towns afraid of Russians. There's no one left for your carousel. When Stalin will be here, people will get used to it. Everyone will come back... to my little carousel. Well? Peace has become, so let's make presents to each other. Look. Nice, isn't it? Here, take it. I also have beautiful German music. Hey! How did it come out? Damn! You look like coming from a film. Turn around! Is it nice? It's not well to be that nice. Not at all. Why? Here, I made it for you. It's been a long time I've been wanting to show it to you. What is it? - A hiding place. - A hiding place?! Yes. For you. I've even put some apples. Why would I hide? Well, when the Russians will come, it'd be better for you. They could find you to their liking and then they won't be making you any favors. So, here it is. As soon as they'll arrive, you'll hide in here and you'll wait for me to come and get you out. Understood? Even if I have to force you to get in here. My God! What a thick head you can have! With the jugs you're carrying... Did you really think peace had come? You make me laugh! Friends! We are free! From now on we can turn the light on without being afraid of punishment. D'you understand what this means? Good evening, Mattiske! Good evening, Mme Schleppe! Nice, isn't it? Nice installation. Lots of light. And here's more. That's nice. That's good, right? Good evening, everyone. Good evening, friends. Have you seen this? Unfortunately, there's no more bread. I've brought two bottles from my '37 vintage. I was saving them for Richard once the war would have been won, but Richard is not here any longer, and the war is lost. Let's dry them! - Will you open them? - Alright. The wurst, we'll cut it into the soup. I'm at peace about the drink, seeing Paul's gluttony. Where're the children? The children? You're closing your eyes. Because it's good. It's no poison! That's all that's left. I hid the rest. Yes! Just in case things got worse! How stupid they can be! I'm saying this... How stupid you are... When we'll get to America, I'll buy you lipstick. I wouldn't want it. Why not? It's made from bedbug blood. Bedbug blood?! Hey, kid! Get lost! He wasn't there at the last reunion. We're short on young people. Mr. Mattiske, for instance, has a very youthful hand. Isn't it so, Mr. railwayman? It hasn't yet lived, or only did so little, this hand! The wine is going to my head! Calm down. Here's your head line. There, under the curve, it makes an unfinished downward arabesque. No, there's something else in store for you. Adversity! It can be seen very well! But... Do you really see all this? Yes, everything. Absolutely everything, my dear sir! I'd like to know if this guy is still alive. Who? Who?! But the German boss! Adolf Hitler. Well, listen, this is a little too much. I've stopped wondering about him since April. With Franke we only swear by que par Thälmann, I'd like to see Adolf in Moscow, taking anti-fascist courses. He's in Spain, with Franco, and is doing just fine. They've only cut him from newspapers and radio, but besides that... - You bet he's not starving! - Oh yes! I'd really like to know how one becomes a Nazi. Come on! Enough with the politics. Let the music play. Motek, play a record for us. Turn the sound down. I don't know what to do with Paul. Paul built me a hiding place. Are you getting it on with him? Not at all. He did it because of the Russians. If you need someone to protect you, that should be me. He meant well. He even put some apples there. Come on... What? How stupid you can be... Isa! Robert didn't work in the hothouse. He was better than that. He was a in house detective with the big Brenningmeier store. Now, with everything burnt down, he must be unemployed. But, during the Nazi regime, the number of thefts was frightening. When, while patrolling, Robert came across someone he knew, that totally threw him off balance. He turned up his collar, put on dark glasses and noiselessly came behind the guy. Then he shouted with a sepulchral voice: "Open your bag right way!" You can bet the guy was scared stiff! He didn't know where to hide. In front of all the customers! Go and bring me my jacket. He only recognized him when he burst into laughter. Oh! He had a stupid laughter, Robert did. He was a phenomenon. Good evening, Frieda! Come sit with us. A funny thing he was. Always joking around. Good evening! Died so young. He stumbled on the carpet and he was gone. That was quick. Wasn't it, Frieda? Wait. Come with me. I'll bring you something. There's something I must do. Are you coming with me? - Where to? - The graveyard. What for? You'll see. Just come on. I'll go everywhere with you. My Richard, he was 13, we grabbed him by his feet and by his arms. We put him on the couch. He had fallen and was bleeding from his nose. I first cleaned him up, then I called. His family came. We were all around him in the room. We said anecdotes from Brenningmeier. At eleven I made coffee for everyone. For Pieritzens Rudolf, my brother-in-law, too, I had to make fried potatoes, and marinated meat, that's how hungry he was. Robert was there... Where we were sitting. It's been now 12 years he's at the graveyard. Speaking about this, Franke went there three times today. What's he up to? No idea. - Will we find them? - Whom? The Americans. Yes. We have a powerful engine. And then, I can smell them from 100 km. I don't feel safe with your weapon. I need it just in case that... To protect you. Come on. They can't see us. What's this all for? Wait. Feel it. Knots. Untie them. They're important. It's a secret. What's the spade for? Listen. It must stay a secret between you and me. D'you swear it? Yes. Running away from the Russians, a S.S. officer and his fiancee came here. came here. To avoid the Americans, they drove with no headlights and slept in barns. And they arrived here. And, in this very graveyard, they buried all their valuables. Hoe do you know all this? An inheritance. Take this. Go ahead. Are you sure it's here? I'm certain. I surveyed it carefully. Back there there's the angel, there Dieckmann's grave. And here Professor Wilhelm Schmidt. Give me some light here. Put this knot on the margin of the grave. Is it straight? No, more this way. Hold it tight. It's sticky. Let everything go. Take your lamp and come here. You like this, don't you? On the right after every knot. That's where we must dig. If we leave, she'll cry. Not when she'll find out we're going to America. Give me the spade... Why are you waddling? I have to take a leak. Well, go somewhere and do it. I can't. You can't?! Why is that? It's a graveyard. I can't. That does it! Me I shit. She won't piss in a graveyard! Lord, Isa! It was worth it. I can't believe it. There's something under. These are figures. Is there a key? No, we'll have to force it. But not right away. D'you know what's inside? It doesn't weigh too much. Come, we have to leave. Put this away. Don't make so much noise! What do we do if they notice something? I've got an idea. Come! Come, everyone! Damn! Where have you got these from? These are my old radios! I fixed them. You're something else. Come here, children! We'll celebrate! Madam! They've arrived! Come on. Come on... The clock is ticking! The time has come! Welcome, gentlemen. We thought you wouldn't come any more! Real faces. This is a real army! A peasants' and workers' army. You can see that right away. At last! Come with me. Let her go. Paul made a hiding place for here Don't be afraid. Go where you know. My bike! My bike! They took my bike! Come, kid, come. Get in. Get in! You'll get out only when I'll tell you. Beautiful madam. German madam. Can I kiss your hand? You've given me so much love, so much potato soup. Name? Name... Name! Your name? Torsten. Me... Me, my name is Vassya. Typhus. No, not there. Here. Good, good! There. No! The girl is sick. Typhus. No! Help! Isa! Joshi! - Stay away. - Let me go! Joshi! Are you nuts? Damn maverick! He brought us bad luck! I told you he was a spy. The jacket! I knew it. A good German doesn't shoot his liberators. Go talk to the officer. You know Russian. I'm Polish. My Russian is very bad. He'll understand you! Go talk to him. - What has he done? - Acted without thinking. He's just a kid, and he's in love, that's all. - What has he done? - Fired a shot. On the Russians? I won't talk to him! - They'll kill me! - Go. It's dangerous. Firing a shot! Jesus, Mary! What a nasty story! Motek, they're bringing down your carousel. Your business. Because of Nazi like you, we're in trouble. Me? Time of truth. I saw you modifying the date on your husband's tombstone. - You don't know anything. - He was not a detective when he died, he was with the Gestapo! - That's not true. - I know everything. Women! Men! Go! Go home. They're nice. They let the Hitler Youth go. Peace at last, I hope. What does peace mean? It means a new beginning. We'll apply our peace. Now, everything will change. D'you understand? Yes, yes. Have you understood? Then say it loud and clear! Tell me... Do yo know Cologne? Yes, I do. My brother owns a electronics store back there. Maybe you could start with tinkering radios. A radio technician! That would be nice. Let's go, then. Come on, you winner's jacket. Come on. Go through the garden. Nobody will see you. I can't go on any longer. Alright. Take a rest. Nobody can see us here. - Will we ever get to Cologne? - Cologne... Cologne, it's like Leipzig. We'll soon be on the American side. 20 kilometers left. Something like that... I'd really like to know what's inside. I'll go find something to open it. The forest is littered with scrap metal. That's too thick. I won't make it. - I'm really hungry. - Me too. No, not now. It doesn't break. No, it's no good. Wait. I'll find you something else. Isa! I've found something. With this, I'll open it. I've already opened it. How? - With my clip. - Impossible. - Yes. - No! - Yes. - Stop it! Look. The box is open. - Silver cigarette case. - Golden chain. A swastika. A golden party insignia. He surely must have been someone important. And this. A silver cross with ruby. Look at this. This will pay for our round trip to America. I don't know what to think about the Russians. Really?
