Nobody's gonna believe me. I killed him. I killed my husband. But it wasn't him! It wasn't him! Sporting event, a volunteer or church activity, - I'm recording here. - Hi honey, look! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But look, I'm so excited. I got my new phone. Cool. Isn't it great? Yeah it's great. So listen, I have this great idea. So our 25th anniversary's coming up, right? Uh huh. And I'm gonna take lots of footage and your present to me is you're gonna string it together and put a video so that we can give it to the kids. Are you recording right now? Yeah. Okay, first lesson is you want it to be, there, so it's like landscape instead of portrait. That's better. Second lesson is, why don't you just use the camera that I already have that you know how to use already? I don't really know how to use it. It's big, it's very complicated. I'm not gonna just - do a - Now honey look, - this is portable! - Video for you for our anniversary. I mean I'm gonna do something more than that. Look, this is all I want, okay? This is portable, I can take it wherever we go, I can just be spur of the moment. And I get to work for our anniversary? Oh come on honey, please, for me? - Fine, okay. - Thank you. No. No, I'm serious, thank you honey. Sorry I interrupted you. You're thanking me now. Wait until you're a client. Oh come on. You get two revisions! Oh stop. All right, it's on. Whoops. Okay, All right. Hi kitty. Oh my god! What?! You scared me. Honey, what do you want to put, a trip to the emergency room in this video? Well don't sneak up - on me like that. - I wasn't sneaking up on you, I was just watching you. Well say something next time. All right. Well, look, I just came up to tell you that I ordered your webcam for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey hon! Hi mom, how's it going? This is so cool, I can actually see you. - Dad got me the webcam. - I can see you too, mom, yeah. Yeah. I have a really cool idea. Okay? I want to do a V log. A V log? Are you talking about a vlog, mom? Yeah, V log! Hold on a second. So anyway, I wanna do this thing but I can't figure out how to get it you know, out there. Are you talking about? Because I can, I don't know, like I want lots of people to see me, you know? Okay, so, were you thinking about going, Like can you hook it up? I mean what do you hook it up to, I'm not sure. Did you want to just post videos on the internet or do you wanna stream your vlogs or V logs? I don't know. Never mind. How about this, mom? Why don't I send you an email with the instructions on how to get all that set up? And have dad help you out if needed and yeah you should be good to go. You got a hip mom, hon. All right, sweety, I'll talk to you later, love you. All right, I love you too, mom. Have a good one. Hi, I'm here to do my first V log. This is kind of, let me do it from the beginning 'cause I wasn't looking at the camera. Hi, my name is Vicky and this is my very first V log. Why am I doing a V log? Well, you know my life is, I've got a new chapter in my life. And I sort of wanna document it, you know. The changes that I'm going through. And I hope there's somebody out there that I can share this with. That you know, we can sort of do this journey together. My kids left home so I've got a new chapter of my life, I'm an empty nester. And it's really, it's kind of hard to adapt to. It's exciting but it's challenging. It's like, you have to develop new habits, you know. There was an ancient Roman, his name was Seneca. And he said count each day as a lifetime. All right, so all I gotta figure out is how. Joe, okay, show me again, show me again. Well I was just telling you that, all right. You want stable. You want stable so I put this together. Why are you laughing? I put this together. Look, it's beautiful! Why are you laughing? Do you wanna do this right? I'm not giving up. You get this stable, I guarantee you, what you're shooting right now, I don't know why you're shooting this, but what you're shooting right now is gonna be a lot less stable than this is. You got your camera here, your phone and then the light, and you can adjust it. Look, you wanted me to do this, I'm gonna do it right. All I need to do is figure out how to get from the XLR to the USB-C. Kevin? To put the audio into the phone. - Kevin. - What? I am not carrying that thing around. Vicky, this is what I do for a living. I am not walking around with that thing. It's really pretty light. Look how stable this is. You're married to a professional video person. You should use professional gear if he's got it. Kevin, look at me. What? I am not carrying that thing around. I bought a phone. You're complicating things, honey. Honey, I'm not complicating stuff. It's just the way, if you're gonna do it, you do it right. I am not carrying that thing around. It's a lot lighter than it looks. See? Oh hey. There, see? This is ridiculous. You probably have to hold it up just a little bit further so you can see the screen clearer. Why are you laughing? I'm not carrying this around. I'm blind. I can't even see if you're in focus. Oh you're in focus here. I am not carrying this around. And that just tightens that down like that. Why are you recording this? That's the whole point of this. Like doing behind the scenes? Of the 10 minute anniversary video? I am trying to capture our everyday life. Okay, okay, okay. So still, I mean I picked this up, like 20 bucks, right. And then we still got lights, all right. Look, I know you think it's ridiculous but you're gonna be glad that the picture isn't all grainy and that stuff if it's low light. Okay. And if we wanna record both of us you can just set it down there. I like that. - All right? - Okay. And then I also got a clip on wide lens adapter. It's just, it's gonna be a nicer, larger picture which will come in handy especially if we do stuff down at the park or something. - Just to look nice. - All right, Kevin? Fine, I will use your new rig. Are you happy? I'm happy. - I just want it to look nice. - Okay. I said I'd use it. - Okay. - All right. So you just started up. You gotta light them both independently but that's, now you can do something at night. Take it, take it, take this! - Take it, take it! - Oh god, what? Kevin! Here's something for your head. I don't think I need, I don't need this. Well. Really, I'm feeling, I just don't want pills. I actually think we need to go see a doctor. No we don't need to see a doctor. I feel fine now, I feel fine now. I don't know what it was. I feel fine now. Really. I appreciate what you're doing. Just, I don't need this. I'm probably just gonna put on a movie or something. Yeah I mean, that was pretty violent. I'm worried about you. Have you ever had a migraine before? No. I've never had one. Maybe it was just a migraine or something. People have migraines all the time. Kevin, I don't think this is working. All I can see is myself. Like your reflection in the screen or something, or? No, all I can see is my face. Well it's probably got the front camera. You need to switch it around. You need to turn it around. You need to spin it around, - the camera. - Okay, okay, okay. No, not like, all right well, that's one way to do it but now you can't see. No, you need to, there's a button. There, now it's, you had to flip it around. - It's working now. - Okay. So this is the park. You should be in there too. Let's get you too. It's about both of us, right? So there. I don't have any makeup on. You look fine. And our little fake lighthouse here. It's not fake. Does it work? Well I mean I'm sure it could, it's just what are they gonna protect, fishing boats from Myer's point? Those lake pirates? Do you miss it, Robin? I miss you, baby. Definitely. I miss all my kids. Yeah. Yeah still, all of this used to be underwater. But summer's under way. Oh, speaking of that, remember when we used to bring the kids down here to swim? Remember we used to bring them down every summer? I remember. Yeah I kind of miss that. But things change. Yeah, things change. Are you still recording? Mhmm. I just, can we just turn, turn it off? What's wrong? Don't be so grumpy. I'm not being grumpy, I just wish you would, all right, no keep rolling, keep rolling. Here's me getting into the car. Oh come on, Kevin. Here she is, hard at work on her clicky clicky keyboard on her amazing 21 nine monitor. I'm working. Compliments of yours truly. I'm working. Well I thought this is what it was supposed to be, is like us in our daily lives so that we can remember back when we were drooling in a cup. Okay, no yes. This is what we used to do when we were - of full facilities. - That is what I want. But right now I'm in the middle of something. Well maybe I'm trying to get in the middle of something. Kevin, go away. I thought we were going to dinner. 'Cause I was in the middle of something too and, We are going to dinner. - If you give me... - I quit 'cause you told me that I had to put on a shirt. They usually appreciate that at restaurants. I had a shirt on. Just give me 10 minutes and I'll be down. Well then I'm gonna get back to, I'm gonna get back to what I was working on. 10 minutes, I'm almost finished. 'Cause it's not gonna be 10 minutes, Vicky. It's gonna be half an hour. I'm almost down with scene, give me 10 minutes. I'll be down, I promise. All right. Now go away please. Well then I'm just gonna set this down. You can do whatever you want to do. Kevin. God. Find your way out of that dark cloud and then change your life significantly to find your way out of that dark cloud and then change your life significantly to find your way out of that dark cloud. What? Kevin? Out of that dark cloud and then change your life significantly to find your way out of that dark cloud, What are you doing? To find your way out of that dark cloud and then change your life significantly to find your way... Hello? Kevin, I'm ready. To find your way out of that dark cloud and change your life significantly. Kevin. I wanted to ask you something. What? I was looking at your video. Uh huh? My kids are finally gone, left the house. And so I'm a, talk about the days without the kids around. And if you empty nesters miss the kids, but it's kind of exciting too. You keep talking about like the kids gone but you're just so bubbly about it. I mean is that, Well, it's my first V log, I'm trying to be cheerful, happy. But you're cheerful about the kids being gone. My kids are finally gone, left the house. Finally gone? Well that's a good thing right? Without the kids around. The days without the kids around. Miss the kids but it's kind of exciting too. Kind of exciting. I mean really? I mean it was really exciting. I'll give you that, it was really exciting, really exciting. Specially when one of them left, it was really exciting. I just, I don't get it. I don't get how you can be so just flippin' about it almost. Kevin, you know I didn't mean that. Kids are gone! Kids are gone, empty nesters. I was talking about Robin and Michelle. I know you were talking, well you know, but there's another one too. So I looked up Dick in the dictionary and there was a picture of me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm working on this, I have my good days and my bad days, and I just had a bad moment, that's all. I'm sorry. You have got to stop taking this out on me. I'm not taking anything out on you. Look, look. I'm sorry. Let's just put it behind us. Let's go to dinner. - We were gonna go to dinner. - I'm making dinner. I'm making dinner. You're boiling water. Look, you've gotten dressed up, let's go to dinner. I don't feel like going anywhere. You don't feel like creme brulee? 'Cause I won't go buy it for you this time. You have to go to the restaurant in order to get it. Creme brulee, creme brulee. You know what? You are a dick. And you need a haircut. We're back. I see that! Oh Brian, did she like it? She loved it. I couldn't get her off the slot machines, I gotta tell you. I'd love to have seen that. Yeah you would have liked it. She had a good time. We did a little bit of Lake Mead and Mt. Charleston, some driving around too, but mostly Vegas. And it was a blast. Ah, I wish we could have come. Yeah, you got good color there. I wish we could have come but you know, things, you know. I get it. But you know, you guys were dealing, it was a tough year this year. You look good though. You look like you're coming along. Thanks, thanks. Yeah and this is awesome. Welcome to the 21st century, you with the webcam, huh? Yeah. I'm with it, right? No, it's good. Did Kevin set it all up for you? Of course. Yeah well, it's good though, I like this. This is really good. So how's he doing? He's better, you know. The little recoup involved but he's doing a lot better. Good. I think it's gonna be okay. Good, glad to hear it. Hey, I'm heading out. I'm gonna attempt to get a round of golf in, - it's a little wet, but, - How can you do that with all this rain? It's not as bad as you think. I gotta start sometime. Season's just starting to crack open here and I'm getting the bug. But I'd like dinner. Can we do dinner sometime? Sure, let's do it at our place this time. Okay, sounds good. Okay well tell Becky I said hi, give her my love. Okay, love you. Love you too. You know I hate doing this, I'm not a hairdresser. - It's not a big deal. - All right. Just do around the ears. Well, be still. - I'm being still. - Okay. Ow, don't kill me, god. Hold on, I gotta fix something. What do you have - to fix? - Just be still! - What do you have? - Be still! - But you... - Ah! What do you have to fix? You keep moving, it's like, What are you laugh? Look at me, honey. Look at you, look at you? How many hoops it's gonna take to realize? I tried to fix it, and you... How do you fix? Fix it, how do you fix it? You made it more. Maybe you can comb it over. Comb it over? What, like this? Did you really just say comb it over? Check out his new look. Oh, it looks nice. I used to wear it almost this short a while back. It's just weird, it's like, It's like somebody else looking back at me. Hi honey, - how are you? - Hey! I got a new webcam, we can talk now. Yeah, it's like you're here but you're not. I'm gonna do a V log. Are you gonna watch? V log, a vlog? Vlog, what's the difference? Never mind, yeah, that sounds good. I will watch your V log. Okay good, good, I'm just starting. You know, we'll get there. By the way, I love your haircut. Thank you. I actually cut it the other night. How about this haircut, huh? Look at baldy. Your mother scalped me, scalped me. Can you believe that? How many glasses of wine did it take to get to that? None. He was being cheap and he made me cut it and I told him I couldn't. Yeah so don't be cheap around your mother or she'll buzz your head. Well, Dad, you get what you pay for. Well he moved. I told him not to move. Anyway honey, I won't keep you. I just wanted to tell you about my V log and wanted you to be sure and watch it. All right, yeah no. Send my love to baldy and good luck with your V log. More people in the middle of their lives find themselves without a significant other. All right, handsome. Ready to go down? Can you give me like an hour? I can't, sorry. I got that guy coming to give me an estimate on the roof. Told them I'd be here. Okay look, don't worry about it. I'll go down by myself. Now I feel like a dick. Don't, it's ridiculous. Look, it's okay, go back to work. Oh, the cap's on. I can't see anything. Spring time! Saw my first Robin the other day, I'm ridiculously happy. Last time we were here it was overcast and windy and gross. This is a beautiful day so I wanted you to see the park as it should be seen. Over there is the creek, and the basketball court and of course our beautiful lake. So this is the southern end of the lake, of Cayuga Lake. And down at that point is Ithaca. And it's our Myer's Point lighthouse. And this is the northern end of the lake. Around that point it actually goes for 40 miles. It's the longest one of the finger lakes. And it is such a beaut... Kevin? Kevin? I thought you didn't wanna come. Oh jeez. Kevin. Hello? When we have beautiful days like this, spring days like this, you just gotta come down here. The simple fact is you have a lot to give to the right person. The simple solution is, single over 40. Single over 40 is a new service that... How did you do that? Do what? How'd you get back here so fast? What are you talking about? You were just down. You were just down at the park. No I wasn't. Yes you were. Honey we talked about this, I got, I saw you down there. It wasn't me. Kevin, I swear to god. You were wearing a different shirt but it looked just like you. Okay so I changed my clothes, raced you down to the park, was down at the park and then raced back home, changed my clothes again and now I'm here? This for 40 miles. The guy up on the point there? That's not a guy, that's a buoy. It's somebody walking a dog. That guy. Kevin? Am I that fat? Oh stop, would you? We're not here to talk about your physique. - Honey, it's, - Kevin? I thought - you didn't wanna come. - That's not me. That's not me, look. Wow, he went behind the thing. Right. - And I go looking for him. - Right. And watch. Hello? Okay so he walked back the other way. Yeah of course he jumped into the water. I would have heard that. Honey, he's gotta be circling behind you. Well look. Do you see the shadow of the lighthouse there? Hold on. I'd see his shadow. I don't see a shadow of a person! I know I saw somebody. And I would hear him if he were walking. I didn't hear any footsteps. Well he's gotta be on the other side of the lighthouse. He's messing with you. He's messing with you! That's undeniable because he disappeared. You don't see a shadow, do you? No. All right, I'll give you it's weird but there's an explanation for it because people don't just disappear. But that was not me. I was up there working on that first video. Well I see you again later. Now hold on. Forward it or whatever. Gotta come down here. See, right there. Just staring at me. You were being so creepy! I'm not that. All right, zoom in. It's just some guy that was messing with you. Zoom in. You can't do that like they do in the movies. You can't just like zoom in and see a crystal clear picture. - From here, - Zoom in. Even at 4k it's gonna, all right, hold on. Well it's not very clear, is it? That's a bald guy and it looks like he's got a goatee. When have I ever worn a long sleeve shirt under a short sleeved shirt? Okay, all right, all right. And I'm not that fat. I mean that's not me, Vicky. Well it looked like you, it really did. Probably some motorcycle guy like they get down there hanging out. It's a guy who's messing with you. All right. It was weird though. It's not me. So spring came on a Tuesday this year. Come on. Oh come on. It's been raining and cold and miserable so it's still been winter up until yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be 95 degrees. Stop being such a pessimist. It's a beautiful day. Can't you just enjoy it? It is pretty. It's gorgeous. You know Kev, you need to learn to live in the moment a little bit more. Why are you laughing? I think you're mugging for the kids or whoever you think's gonna be watching this, this video of yours. - Hey, come on! - Hey look, it's hey, - Look, look at it. - It's upstate New York. Look at it, it's beautiful. It is beautiful. I will give you that. It's gorgeous, I mean look at that sky. I saw it. It's like a painting. You mean like one of Andy's paintings. It's time to talk about Andy. Our son Andy died a little less than a year ago. He committed suicide. He was at art school. I remember that call like it was yesterday. Course Kevin and I got down there as fast as we could, but there's nothing we could do. Except the stuff you do after somebody's died. We talked to the boy who lived in the room next to his. And he said he thought that Andy was talking to somebody the night he killed himself. And he thought it was Kevin. It's not possible, Kevin was in Philadelphia on a shoot. So it couldn't have been him. Always wonder what could have gone through his mind to make him do something like that. It's been really hard, but I think it's been especially hard on Kevin. He just... I guess I don't know. We'll never get used to it, either of us. It just found a deep place in Kevin's heart and he just hasn't healed. It's so weird. Sometimes I catch myself looking at the front door. And thinking that Andy will just come breezing in like he used to. But that's never gonna happen again. The thing that's really cool about these lights other than them being small is that they match the daylight temperature. You know what? Yeah I know what, you got a cat on your head. I don't feel like cooking. We are going to dinner. All right, we can go to dinner, that's fine. Okay great. You know what, you take that stupid hat off. And I will go change. Turn the lights off. Okay, so I thought I'd bring the camera and film us on the way to the restaurant. Hey, how come you're not... What is this? What is this? Why did you do this? I didn't do anything. Why did you do this, Vicky? Why did you bring this back upstairs? I put this away for a reason, all right? I didn't. Put it in my chair. Look, I'll tell you something. And I know what you're thinking. That I just wanna forget him, all right? I don't wanna forget him, okay? I'm going to deal with it the way that I need to deal with it, all right? It's what I told you in the hospital, and I'm trying. But I can't just be surrounded by this. I can't be surrounded by him and reminders and you wanna turn this whole place into a shrine! I don't, that's not fair. This is mine. He did it for me, and if I wanna put it away for a while or forever, that's my business. I didn't do anything. Well what do you think, I did it? I didn't do it. You had to have done it! I didn't. Somebody put this in my chair! It was in the trunk with the rest of his things! I know it was! Where I put it, where it should have stayed until I decided to bring it out. Not you. Not you because you don't agree with the way that I'm processing this, the way I'm dealing with this. Drinking myself half to death and all that stuff and whatever, okay fine. Fine, that was a mistake. But I still need to process it the way that I need to process it. And I just sit there and just flagrantly put this... I didn't do that! I would never do that! Who did it then?! I don't know. Oh jeez. You know. You know I'm right about this. You can't let this go. Just different for me. But you can't let it go either. And this is horseshit. God, I really miss him. I so miss him every day. Kevin, he just, I know he feels the same way but he just wants to, it's like he just wants to get rid of him. I can't do that, he was my baby. I still need him around even if it's just the picture or an old shirt. And I can't even bring up his name! But I also understand. I still have two children here and they need us. And we have to go on for them. It's not fair to them otherwise. When things like this happen, I don't know what to do. I have nobody to talk to. Oh god, I miss him so much. I miss him. Looks really good. Thank you. Look, Vic. I know I'm not always very good at demonstrating how much you mean to me. But you are very important to me. I just don't show it the way I should all the time. While you were making dinner, this is the footage of that party from last summer of him. I'm sorry I made you cry. Whatcha doin'? I just wanted to mow but it's still so wet. It's cold too. Hey listen, you know, it just feels like things are getting a little tense around here, you know? I'm not tense. Look, I think, we've been in the house too much. I know we've been working but I think we should just get out of here for a while. Let's go to dinner or something. No, I mean get out of here for a while, just get in the car, No, I don't wanna do that. Kevin, it would be good for us. - I got things to do. - Let's just get out of here for a while. I don't wanna go anywhere. Why? You're between jobs - right now. - I'm not going anywhere. Kevin, I think it'll be - good for... - I'm not going anywhere. Okay. It's beautiful. Yes, it is. Part of having a dog. Best part of this, for sure. Thanks. Reminds me of when we, I don't think I ever told you this. The boys and I were out here walking along the tracks one time and we got to the bridge. And there's this loaded diaper on the bridge. And of course Andy doesn't pay it any attention. Robin goes and investigates it then being Robin, he's like, "Dad, do you think there's a baby? "I mean, were they changing a baby "on the bridge, on the train bridge?" and then turned into like, "Is there a homeless family out here "or is there a baby lost out here?" I mean just all of that and then quiet for a minute or so and then Andy all of a sudden turns around and he says, "Bro, sometimes shit just happens." Sounds like him. You think the dead ever think about us? What are you doing? I'm putting on a cover for the game. No, we don't need that. Why are you taping this? You're not gonna film us playing cards, are you? Yeah. Honey, nobody, this is for us and I don't care about watching us and Jody and Lonnie - playing cards together. - I care. - First of all, - Could you help me here? No, I don't want that on. That's stupid-looking. It's a top for, it's a gaming top. It's so it protects your table top. It's stupid. It's not stupid. Right, laugh, that's fine, that's just funny. Could you help me here? - It's going on. - No! I don't want it there. Kevin? Ow! Oh my god. Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. What's wrong? Honey, what's wrong? It's just that headache again. Oh my god. Kevin, we've gotta go see a doctor. I'm not going to see a doctor. Then let's go - to the hospital. - People get headaches. - This might be serious! - Like I told you, it's just probably a migraine or something. It's not a big deal. Migraines don't work like this. The other one went away, this one will go away. Just stop. Kevin, this is important. You need to see somebody. Kevin! Stop it! Kevin, cut it out! Dammit Kevin, this is pissing me off, quit it. What's wrong with you? He has been really behaving strangely. And you know what, it's not the first time. When Andy died, Kevin buried himself in a bottle. Many bottles. He went on a drinking bender like you couldn't believe. And you know what, he ended up in the hospital. His behavior was just so erratic during that time. And he's starting to remind me, I'm starting to see some of those same behaviors coming up again. And it's really scaring me a little bit. I don't think he's drinking again. I don't think that he would ever go back there. He knows he'd die if he did. I don't think he's there yet. But he's behaving like that. He's reminding me of those days. And I really don't know what to do. I thought you said dinner was gonna be special tonight. Well what do you want? Steak? Steak? Yeah. Honey, you don't eat beef. You haven't had beef for months. Since it's special, I thought steak. Steak is usually pretty special. I didn't know that. I mean, okay, we can have steak tomorrow night then. This is fine. Sorry. Steak tomorrow. I gotta talk to you about something. Yeah. Well, it's about Kevin. He's been behaving really weird. He's been doing some bizarre things lately. Well you know, I mean, he's just processing things I'm sure still with Andy. You cope with it differently. You talked it out and he's internalizing a lot of stuff, so. I know. I know but Brian, last night, he shoved a bowl of pasta in my lap. I mean, it's weird behavior but I'm starting to detect a little more anger than is normal for him. I've known Kevin almost 30 years. I mean that just doesn't seem like him at all. Why don't you guys get away from things? You know, maybe take an overnight, go up to the falls or something? Thing is, I tried that. I tried to get him to go away for a weekend and he was adamant. He refuses to leave. It's like he's attached to the house and won't leave it. I can barely get him to go to the store with me. All right, well. I don't know. I think it would be good to get away from there. I think there's reminders. I just think he needs a fresh, maybe start smaller, you know. Go down the lake or something. Try again. But let me know if this continues 'cause I mean, this is atypical for him. So I don't know. Well maybe you're right. Maybe since he's so opposed to it, instead of going away for a weekend or something, we can just take, I don't know, an afternoon, go to the falls or something maybe. It's a good idea. Okay. I know, I'm kind of dumping stuff. No, no, no I get it, I get it. It's good, you can. Hey, I still like this communication with the webcam so feel free to reach out to me anytime. Okay thank you, I appreciate that. All right. Love you, sis. Love you too. Hey, Kevin, listen. Kevin. Hey hon, I wanted, Kevin? Kevin. How does he keep? Kevin! Would you stop? Kevin! You're freaking me out here. What are you doing in the dark basement? Kevin! Would you please answer me? This isn't funny anymore. How'd you do that? Dammit Kevin, I have been chasing you all over this house. Why didn't you answer me? Honey, I've been here for quite a while. Wait a minute. Hey, look at me. What? What? Nothing, never mind. Kevin? What are you doing? Kevin. Hey! Oh god. What are you doing? Watching TV. The TV's not on. Kevin, the TV is not on. Look, it's late. Come on, let's go to bed. Okay. I've got your water. Come on. Here, here's the water. Hey you, let's go to the park. I don't feel like going to the park. What's wrong? Just my shoulder's hurting again. That knot of yours? Yeah. All right, sit down. Sit down. I'll rub your shoulder. It's not gonna hurt. It won't hurt. Come on, it'll might make you feel better. There, right? Yeah, now it's the same. It's the same thing that I had right before we got married where I couldn't even move my neck for two days. Oh god, I remember that. I also remember that's when you started drinking. Why would you say that? Because that's what happened? Why would you suggest that I have a drink? - I didn't! - You were there when the doctor said I could never drink again. Remember my whole new list of nevers that I have to deal with? Kevin, I wasn't suggesting... I'm serious though, why would you do that? I didn't! You know how sensitive that is for me. I didn't suggest - you have a drink! - I can never drink again, - why would you say. - I know that. You just sat here, you just sat here and said that I had. I am not doing this with you. You suggested that I have a drink! Like I did back then, yes you did! I did not. You know what, what does the doctor know, right? Fine, fine. The hell with him. - Make me a drink. - No. Make me a drink, is that what you want? Make me a drink. No! Make me a drink! Make me a drink right now! Make me a drink! Like one of those big tall ones that you sucked down every night! Five or six of them! - I do not. - While you're making dinner! You exaggerate. Make me a drink! And while you're at it, while you're checking things off, my list of nevers, why don't you give me five more minutes with my dead kid? Kevin! Conjure that one up! Let's just take care of the whole list of nevers all at once. Can't believe you just said I should have a drink. I can't believe you just said what you did. I mean look at him. He just, he doesn't do this. He doesn't garden, he never does this kind of thing. Maybe he's just getting some exercise and you know, wants to garden now. Brian, no, this is really out of character for him. Is he drinking again? No, no, I know that. Well I mean, after Andy passed, did he get some medication that he started to take? No, no they didn't give him anything. Is he taking anything though, - something else? - No, I don't think so. I really don't. Hmm, I mean could be work, you know? A lot of stress from. Nothing unusual's going on. I don't know, I mean. It's still maybe just a process. Okay well, look. Do me a favor, would you go talk to him? Yeah, yeah. I mean he's not just really communicating with me these days. I don't know what's going on. Maybe he'll talk to you. All right, I'll go out. Do me another favor, would you take the camera, I would like to have this. You mean, and record him? Yeah, just film the whole thing. Yeah, it won't hurt, all right. - Hey Kevin. - Hey. What you doin', man? Not a whole lot. She's got you doing that too, huh? Yeah, I. It's like you gotta have it. If you're related to me you gotta have a camera before you can talk to me anymore, it feels like. She's always got that thing on me. Ah, she's into it, I don't know Like a neat little hobby or something for her to do, right? Yeah I guess so. What are you putting a flower bed in? No I'm just, I'm gonna plant something, I'm just not sure. You, know, just felt like digging and planting something. But not, I said not sure what I'm gonna do. I mean, I just felt like four of something here'll probably work. Just to fill this in 'cause this is all, can't dig over there 'cause that's, I mean there's about six or seven pets buried over there, but. Over here is just sort of dead. Just thought I'd plant something. Four seemed like the right number. I mean I've got room for a fifth one here if I decide to depending on what I wanna plant. So you're staying for dinner? Yeah. Good. Let me know if I can help you. I think I'm good. What? Oh god. Where are you going? Kevin! Oh jeez. He doesn't even have his keys. Hey Kevin. How do you start this thing? How'd you do that? Do what?! You were just in the car! No I wasn't. How do you start this thing? What is the big deal, what? The big deal is that you were in two places at once, Kevin. This again. Vickie, I wasn't in two places at once. You were there and then you were over there. Where is there? Here in the kitchen? You were in the car and all of a sudden you're by the tree. Vickie, I was just in the garage and I was trying to get, Okay, we're gonna look at this footage and I'm gonna - prove it to you. - I'm not looking. I want to get the lawn mowed. We're looking at this footage. Fine. You know it's the first day in three weeks that it hasn't been raining and I'm in here doing this crap instead of out there mowing like I should be. Okay so I'm in the side yard. You've got the camera on me all the time these days so what's the big deal? All right, go to the end. I'm in the side yard! Go to the end. See? Look, maybe your app has a stitch feature to it. This is a different day. That's today. - I'd give you that. - No, it's all the same day. - Vicky. - Go back and fast forward. All right, I don't remember doing this - but still, it doesn't mean... - Fast forward. Fine! Really? Kevin! Oh jeez, he doesn't have keys. Now watch. Hey Kevin. How do you start this thing? See? Explain that please. Hey Brian. Hey Vickie. I have to talk to you about something very, very strange that happened. The other day I was taping Kevin. He was in the driveway, gesticulating wildly and talking to nobody. And then suddenly he was there. And almost no time elapsed. He was here and then he was there. It was like he was in two places at one time. Right, well I mean, we know somebody can't be two places at one time. And I'll grant you, I've seen him acting strange. He's almost doing a little bit of a bipolar thing. I mean you look a little worried though. Well, what I really would like to do here is show you the footage. But he went in and he got my phone and he took it off. So that I don't even have any proof anymore. I don't know where he keeps his stuff so I can't even show it to you. And I know you're not gonna take my word for it Brian but this really happened. And it's scaring me! No I believe something's happening. I see that. Just, I mean you still have your camera and all your gear, right? Why don't you document some more? I don't know if you remember Tim, he's my neighbor. He's a psychiatrist. You do some documentation and then we'll meet up and maybe we'll show it to him and just see what his professional opinion is. 'Cause I still think this is some sort of a bipolar episode. Maybe something to do with the loss and the coping he's still going through. You know what, I get that. And I thought that. I thought that maybe he should see somebody. But Brian, I'm telling you this is just really hard to describe, but there's something more going on here. Something really weird. Vickie, you're worrying me. I mean do we want to call the authorities? No, you mean like the pol-, no. I mean, I'll come over. Let me come over. No, I don't think so. Honestly I don't think that would help right now. I appreciate it. All right, well look. I'm 20 minutes away. If you ever feel like you need me, you call me and I'll be over. In the meantime, just document everything that's going on. Hide it so I can take a look at it this time. Well I have to hide my phone but I'll do that. - Thank you. - Well yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Thank you. All right, be safe. Nobody's gonna believe me. Well I'm here now, right? Who knows where else I am right now. I am trying really hard to figure this out. I mean two places at once, it just, it doesn't. I went online and I've been doing some research. I keep looking at it. I'm in the side yard and I don't remember that at all. Don't remember out there carrying on like that. Kevin mentioned once to me this kind of off the cuff remark about maybe at the park I saw his doppelgänger. Looking it up, it also means evil twin. That's me. I came across this medieval legend, the legend of Gwenyd. And she lost her lover in battle. And it says heart broken, she longed to escape this world. Her double from another world was drawn by Gwenyd's grief. For that sorrow was the key that could unlock the door between their worlds. She called to Gwenyd, and she said "I'll change places with you." Thinking that she would be reunited with her lover, Gwenyd happily agreed. She opened that door. I mean it's been six months ago when I was drinking for breakfast. Yeah, that's me and I don't remember it but sure that's me. But I remember everything now. I remember everything now. And that I don't remember. But once there she decided it was very evil. It wasn't what she thought at all and her twin was truly evil. You know, the lighthouse, I looked at that again and maybe that could be me or not me, but I just know I was up here. I know I wasn't down there. That's not definitive, but it's me in the side yard. That's me in that side yard. She wanted to come back to her own world but it was too late. You see, Gwenyd's sorrow was the key but only the doppelgänger could control the door. I can't. I can't explain it. The reason I just keep thinking about Kevin being in two places at once. You know, like this made me think of him. But I know you can't be in two places at once. It just, that doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen. Brian's right. People can't be in two places at one time. I know that. You can't be in two places. You can't. You physically cannot be in two places. At once. Okay. So when I got up this morning, Kevin sent me two emails last night after three in the morning. Here's the first one. And it makes no sense. Okay. And then, right after he sent that one he sent this. I don't even know what to make of this. What did you want me to film? Okay so I actually want you to film for the first time. Okay. So this is gonna be part of our video and it's an introduction to an amazing weekend. What? I figured it all out, look. I've had a difficult year, you've had a difficult year, we've all had a difficult year. - Right. - And so, I finally figured out a really special thing that we can all do together. And we're gonna do it this weekend. Both of the kids are gonna be involved. - What? - Robin's coming. Robin's coming from out of town. You didn't tell me. - How come you didn't - And Michelle's got - tell me? - the day off. Well because I want it to be a surprise. I didn't wanna tell you until I got it all figured out. And I've got it all figured out. I've got it all arranged. Well what is it? It's something that's just gonna bring us all together again. - What? - I really think, I really think that the kind of year that we've had, specially me, and so I'm trying to make up for, you know, for not always being there for everybody. Just bring the five of us together and have an amazing weekend together, and it's really gonna turn things around for this family. It's gonna be amazing. What is it though? Honey, it's a surprise. I'm telling you that we're gonna have a surprise but it's just gonna be really, really special. Really amazing. You're gonna love it. It's gonna be incredible. Shh. Oh shit. You reached Kevin, I'm not available. Please leave a message. Kevin? Where are you? You didn't even tell me you were leaving. Kevin, please call me back. I really need to talk to you about your special weekend. I was in your office and I saw, where did you go? You didn't even tell me you were leaving. I really need to talk to you. In fact, what I really want is I want you to come home wherever you are. Call me and then I want you to come home. Kevin, please call me. Hey mom, how's it going today? Hi honey. Listen, the reason I called, we have to cancel this weekend. Really, 'cause I just talked to Dad a couple of hours ago. I know. Did something come up? - Is everything okay? - Yes. Yeah, no everything's fine, we just, just we can't do it this weekend. What's going on? You're acting weird. No. Dad ate something weird, I don't know, he's got a stomach thing. So let's reschedule. All right. And you're all right, everything's good? Is there anything you need me to do? No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Just stay there, I'll take care of things. Just promise me, you're not gonna come anywhere around here this weekend. Promise me that, okay? Are you sure there's nothing else wrong, mom? 'Cause I can come home even if Dad's sick. It's not a problem for me. No, no, please don't. I want you to stay there. I'll handle it. Mom, you're kind of freaking me out. I don't mean to freak you out, I'm sorry. This is just a terrible time. And you know, we'd love to see you but, Yeah I'd love to see you... Not this weekend, okay? I will call you later. I need to get... Definitely call me later. I will. And we'll reschedule for some other weekend. Absolutely. I love you. Love you too. Tell Dad I love him as well. I'll do that. All right. Okay. I'm documenting everything now. He says the five of us have to be together. It's funny I didn't catch that the first time. But then I saw he was looking up poison. Who does that? I mean, we just, we lost a kid. And now you wanna take away my remaining kids, are you? I obviously can't trust him anymore. At least my kids are safe. But I gotta do something. Call the police... Kevin? He's not home. Kevin? Just what I need. I don't know what to do. Brian can be here in 20 minutes. I just made a mistake, no big deal. See you soon. What?! Who are you talking to? Robin. About what? About this weekend. I canceled this weekend. Well, change of plans. After all, a mother can be very persuasive when she wants to be. Oh Jesus. Oh god. Vickie. Oh god. Oh god, oh god. Oh god, oh. Oh god, oh god. Oh gosh. No, no. Oh! Mom? Help me! Michelle? - Mom! - Michelle! Mom? Don't you love us? Robin. Oh gosh. Mommy! No, no. Vickie? Vickie, are you down there? It's not you. No, no. No, no. No! Get away! What are you?! Ouch! Stay away! Vic? Vickie, are you down here? The lights aren't working. It's not you. It's not you. - It's not you. - Vic? - Vic? - Get out, get out! Ouch, ouch! Vickie, wait! The eyes. Kevin? The eyes! Oh my god, no, no, no, no, no, no! Kevin! Oh my god, Kevin, Kevin. Oh my god, Kevin. I killed him. I killed my husband. But it wasn't him. It wasn't him. Nobody's gonna believe me. Oh god. Nobody's gonna believe me. Oh god, help. Death doesn't close the door.
