[fanfare] [drum roll] [cheering] [whimsical music] [Ryan Seacrest] Grab your Santa hats... Merry Christmas! ...because tonight we come together and unite in holiday song and spirit, and share in the joy of Disney... I just love it! ...with some of your favorite stars. -Are you serious? -Yes! So gather the family around the tree, put a log on the fire, and get ready to sing your festive little hearts out to some of the most beloved holiday classics of all time. 'Tis the season for the Disney Holiday Singalong. Come here, guys. [all] ♪ Christmas... ♪ Merry Christmas, everybody! -Merry Christmas! -Whoo! -Merry Christmas! -[laughs] [blowing kisses] Happy holidays, and welcome to the Disney Holiday Singalong. Ryan Seacrest here. Thank you to Michael Bublé and the family for kicking things off and getting us in the festive spirit. This is my absolute favorite time of year, and I'm so happy to be back with you for this very special singalong. The holidays are all about generosity and sharing joy, and I promise there's gonna be a lot of both here tonight. So gather the family around. Moms, Dads, dogs, cats, come one, come all, and let's belt out our favorite holiday songs together with some extra Disney magic sprinkled in for fun. Tonight, we've asked some very talented stars and their families to make a gift especially for you. They've each created an inspired homemade singalong performance, and as you'll see, "home" can mean many things. The roof over your head, the people you're with, a city that you love. And because it's been a while, you may need a little help getting those vocal cords ready. We have Hollywood's hottest couple here with a little vocal warmup. The tabloids and paparazzi cannot get enough of these two. Of course I'm talking about Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. Actually, let me do that again. It's Miss Piggy and Kermit. She gets star billing per her contract. Thanks, Ryan. Okay, everybody, let's all get ready for a night of magical holiday singing with some vocal warmups. [chuckles nervously] Oh, hold on a second. I-I thought Miss Piggy was gonna help me out here. -Piggy? -Yes? It's time to warm up. Oh, then I'll turn up the thermostat. -No, no, no. -Hmm? We're all about to warm up for the Disney Holiday Singalong. -Wait, that's happening? -That's happening. -Now? -Yeah, right now. Oh! Oh! And we're supposed to lead everyone at home in a vocal warmup. -Right. -Right. Uh, Piggy, where are you going? It's cold in here. I was gonna turn up the thermostat. No, we have to do this now. Can I at least get a blanket? -No, no blanket. -Sheesh. Somebody could stand to get in the holiday spirit. [clears throat] Friends, allow us to now lead you in a vocal warmup. Hey, what are we-- what are we supposed to do now? What-what do you mean? You just do a little warmup. I'm a diva. I don't warm up. I just sing. -I know, but you can just-- -I sing! That's what I do! My voice is always perfect! -I don't know how to do this. -[stammering] Okay, okay, everybody, everybody. Why don't we all just do a scale together? Scale? Stars don't work for scale. -A musical scale. -I knew that. Here we go. ♪ Do re mi fa so la ti do ♪ -[holding note] -[glass shatters] Nailed it! Let me know if Seacrest needs me later for a solo. Oh, it's freezing in here. Hmm. That's the third camera this week. [sighs] Back to you, Ryan. [chuckles] I love that she always leaves on a high note. Now it's time for one of life's great questions: Do you want to build a snowman? The answer, of course, is yes, because no holiday celebration is complete without a classic from Frozen. Here to perform it, a pair of talented sisters just like the movie's heroines Elsa and Anna: Chloe and Halle. Now, they've transformed their backyard into a winter wonderland just for you, so put your mittens and your scarves on, because the temperature is about to drop a few hundred degrees for one frosty, fun singalong. [festive piano music] ["Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" plays] [Chloe and Halle] Elsa? Go away, Anna. [vocalizing in harmony] [vocalizing continues] [imitating clock ticking] [vocalizing in harmony] That was stunning. Thank you to Chloe and Halle. I'm starting to feel all kinds of festive already. That was amazing. Hope you're feeling festive too, because tonight we're celebrating all the holidays-- Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa-- however you celebrate and wherever you are in the world, this singalong is for you. And our next gift is coming to us all the way from South Korea. Now, kids, that's not quite as far as the North Pole, but close. It's from K-pop supergroup BTS, and they're joining forces with Kris Kringle himself. So grab the milk and cookies for next to the fireplace and sing along like you've never sung along before, because Santa Claus is comin' to town. [whimsical music plays] [all] Ho ho ho ho ho! -Happy, happy holidays! -[Jimin] Let's go, Disney! Hey! [band member 1] Hey! Whoo! [imitating Santa] Ho ho ho! Hey, kids! What do you wish for this Christmas? Let's see it. It's... BTS! -BTS! -Let's go! [band member 2] Yeah! Hey! Here we go! ♪ Whoa-oh ♪ Whoo-hoo! Whoo whoo! ♪ Yahh-uh-huh! ♪ -[laughing] -One more! Yes! [all laugh] [Jimin] Happy holidays! -Happy holidays! -Happy holidays! -Thank you! -[band member 3] Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Bangtan for you. Oh! That was amazing! Thank you, BTS. Happy holidays. Way to get us movin'! Now, Christmas is all about family, and two members of our Disney Singalong family are Derek and Julianne Hough. Tonight they're each prepared performances, and I've been told there's been some friendly, festive rivalry between the siblings, so I can't wait to see what they've cooked up. First we have Derek and his girlfriend and fellow Dancing With the Stars cast member, Hayley Erbert, with a gift to you from their home-- and their home away from home-- a place you might recognize. [jazzy "Jingle Bells" playing in distance] [music louder] [music softer] [music louder] [jazzy intro to "Jingle Bells" continues] Whoooa! [instrumental interlude plays] Come on, Mickey, let's go! [propulsive beat plays] [sleigh bells ringing in distance] How's all that singing going? Is Dad keeping up, hmm? Is Mom hoarse yet? Well, I hope not, because for this next one, I want everyone to sing so loud that Santa's elves can hear us all the way from the North Pole. It's good to keep them motivated. They've got a lot of toys to make this year. Grammy-winning superstar Pink is taking the reins for this one, performing her family's holiday favorite. It's "The Christmas Song," and check this out, joining her is her adorable nine-year-old daughter, Willow. ["The Christmas Song" plays] [instrumental interlude plays] And merry Christmas to you, Pink and Willow. What a talent. Incredible. And now from one talented mother to another, we have Grammy award-winning artist Ciara joining us from her home in Seattle. Ciara, hey there, happy holidays! Hey, Ryan! Happy Holidays! [laughs] [Ryan] We're curious, what are the holidays like for you and your husband, Russell Wilson, up in Seattle with the kids? Set the stage for us. You know, we're typically in the thick of football during this time of year, and so it's a little bit of football and Christmas. Uh, but it's always the best waking up, you know, as a family and seeing the kids open up their gifts and seeing the joy on their faces. And of course, the good food on Christmas Day is always the best, too. So it's always really special. Well, let me tell you, we are all super excited to have you here tonight. Tell us what's in store, Ciara. Yeah, it's me and my little babies, Future and Sienna, we're gonna rock around the Christmas tree tonight. Okay, well, I understand your little babies would actually like to take over my job temporarily and introduce your singalong, so by all means, take it away. Future and Sienna. [both] Are you ready to rock around the Christmas tree? ["Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" plays] -[record scratching] -Here we go! [hip-hop beat plays] ♪ Rock rock, rock-rock-rock ♪ I like that. ♪ Rock rock, rock rock rock ♪ Go, Future. Go, SiSi. My little babies. -[hip-hop beat continues] -So cute! [note sustains] Ooh! That was fun. Merry Christmas. [sleigh bells jingling] So cute, Ciara and the kids! Delightful! Thank you guys so much. And from one incredible group singalong to another, we're in for a real treat with a performance of the moving finale from the Broadway musical performed by the stars from Disney on Broadway. This is going to be a really special tribute, as it's the first time they've performed onstage since the shutdown last spring. Cast members from Disney's Broadway spectacles The Lion King, Aladdin, and Frozen are back together on the stunning stage at The New Amsterdam Theater in the heart of Times Square to send this message of hope and resilience. Here they are with "Let It Go."

Rudolph's nose started glowing red with all the holiday cheer you're putting out there with your singing, so keep it coming. Earlier, we got a spirited visit from Derek Hough. But, not to be outdone, we have his equally talented sister Julianne next. She has something up her Disney princess sleeve. It's a special Disney medley of the Snow White classic "Whistle While You Work" and holiday staple "Let It Snow." But I'll let three people very close to Julianne explain. It's her three nieces, Ari, Adi, and Avery. What happens when you combine our three favorite things? Disney, holidays, and our Aunt Julianne. This! ♪♪ ["Whistle While You Work/Let It Snow" medley plays] ♪ Mmm... ♪ ♪♪ [smooches, blows] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [whistle] Our next gift of a performance is by Kerry Washington. Here to introduce her is her good friend from Good Morning America, Robin Roberts. Oh, Ryan, thank you. It is my honor to introduce this next singalong performed by the one and only Kerry Washington. Now, you kids at home, you know her as the voice of racing car enthusiast Natalie Certain in Cars 3. She also happens to be a massive Disney fan, known to belt out a Disney classic or four at karaoke. I've heard you, Kerry. So join her now, will you, as she spreads some much needed joy to the world. ♪♪ ["Joy To The World" plays] Up next is a real career milestone for all you budding singers and Hamilton fans out there. Why? Because you're about to collaborate with one of our generation's greatest voices. It's Tony and Grammy-winning star Leslie Odom Jr. Leslie, happy holidays. How you doing? Happy holidays. Let's get this party started. I'm great. [laughs] You're gonna be taking on "What's This?" from The Nightmare Before Christmas. This is not an easy song to perform, Leslie. -No, it is not. -[Ryan laughs] But, um, with the help of our friends at home, I think I can do it. Do you feel any pressure at all? Uh, I feel tons of pressure, and, uh, you're making it worse, so thank you for that. [chuckles] Sorry. All right, then let's stop now. Uh, good luck with the pressure because this one's a total tongue twister, so let's see who in your family can keep up. Take it away, Leslie. ♪♪ What is this? ♪♪ ♪♪ [gasps] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ -[wind whistling] -[bells tinkling] Whoa! [barks] Whoa-a-a-a-a!

Now, because it's so cold and wintry outside, we want to make sure this next singalong will make you feel all warm and fuzzy. It's a holiday staple, and I was even told its Minnie Mouse's personal favorite. So have yourself a merry little Christmas singing along with a gift from the phenomenal Adam Lambert. ♪♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ And now to close us out this evening, a song about the peace and love we all long for and the feelings of goodwill and generosity that unite us all. The song is "Silent Night," and it will be performed by one of the world's greatest vocal talents, the legendary Andrea Bocelli, coming to us all the way from his home in Italy. And although Andrea is on the other side of the Atlantic, this just demonstrates how we can all be together and unite through our shared love of singing and the magic of Disney. Thank you again for singing along with us, and, as the saying goes, happy holidays to all, and to all a good night. ♪♪ ["Silent Night" plays] -Happy holidays. -Happy holidays. Happy merry Christmas!
