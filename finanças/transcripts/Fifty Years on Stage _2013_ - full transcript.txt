So we have got two hours to show the vast range of work that the National has done over the last 50 years by staging short scenes from some of the most memorable shows and there are more than 800 choose from. We have got an unbelievable array of great actors, all of them at some point members of the National Theatre company. And six of them were in the first National Theatre company that started at The Old Vic in 1963. A small part of the show is from the archive recently discovered and we do not think ever seen before. But most of it is going to be absolutely live, live on stage and live on television and we're not sure anybody has ever done anything quite like this before. Olivier Theatre 50 Years On Stage company. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your beginners call, your calls please, Miss Maxwell-Martin, Mr Barker, Mr Jacobi, Mr Lester and Mr Townsend. Thank you. We are starting this evening the same way the National Theatre started in 1963, with the opening scene of Hamlet where the sentries on the battlements see the ghost of Hamlet's father. Playing the ghost this evening will be Sir Derek Jacobi, who played Laertes in the original production 50 years ago. The first voice you will hear is live archive recording of Richard Hampton. Richard spoke the first lines in the performance ever given by the National Theatre. The rest of the scene will be played by members of this year's company. I am one of them. Who is there? Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself. Long live the King! Barnardo? He. You come most carefully upon your hour. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart. Have you had quiet guard? Not a mouse stirring. Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there? Friends to this ground. And liegemen to the Dane. Give you good night. O, farewell honest soldier, who hath reliev'd you? Say, what, is Horatio there? A piece of him. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear. So let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we have two nights seen... Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again. In the same figure like the King that's dead. Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio. Looks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder. It would be spoke to. Question it, Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark did sometimes march. By heaven, I charge thee speak. It is offended. See, it stalks away. Stay, speak, speak, I charge thee speak. It was announced that he was to be the director of the National Theatre. He was very excited by it. He was also very frightened. Larry kind of works, he has an area around him which is quite difficult to penetrate. It got easier. It got easier and more relaxed. Now look here, gentlemen, he that bids the fairest shall have me! My dear, I'd prefer you, I'd make you a corporal this minute! Corporal? I'll make you my companion. You shall eat with me! You shall drink with me! You shall lie with me, you young rogue. You shall receive your pay and do no duty. Then you must make me a field officer! I'll do more than all this - I'll make you a Corporal and give you brevet for sergeant. Can you read and write, sir? Yes. Then your business is done. I'll make you chaplain to the regiment. It was an actors' theatre in that it was run by the greatest actor we had. Joan was very important because she was Mrs Olivier, and she sort of kept us all in check really. Now tell me Mikhail Lvovich, if I had a friend, or a younger sister, and if you found out that she, well - suppose she loved you, how would you take that? I don't know. No how I expect. I should give her to understand that I could not care for her, my mind was taken up with other things. Anyway if I'm going, I really must get off. Goodbye, my dear girl or we shall not finish till morning. I'll go out through this way if you don't mind, I don't want your uncle to detain me. No, no don't trouble please. My voices were right, they told me you were fools and that I was not to listen to your fine words...or trust to your charity. You promised me my life but you lied. You think that life is nothing but not being stone dead. It is not the bread and water I fear. I can live on bread, when I have asked for more? 'Tis no hardship to drink water if the water be clean. Bread hath no sorrow for me, nor water no affliction. But to shut me from the light of the sky, and the sight of the fields and flowers, to chain my feet so that I can never again ride with the soldiers or climb the hills; to make me breathe foul damp darkness, and keep me from everything that brings me back to the love of God when your wickedness and foolishness tempt me to hate Him. All this is worse than the furnace in the Bible that was heated seven times. I could do without my warhorse, I could drag about in a skirt. I could let the banners and the trumpets and the knights and the soldiers pass me and leave me behind as they leave the other women, if only I could still hear the wind in the trees, the larks in the sunshine, the young lambs crying through the healthy frost, and the blessed blessed church bells that send my angel voices floating to me on the wind. But without these things I cannot live, and by your wanting to take them away from me, or from any human creature, I know that your counsel is of the devil, and that mine is of God. In 1966 Kenneth Tynan, who was the literary manager of the National Theatre came back from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with a dazzling new play which focused on two very peripheral characters from Hamlet. It was Tom Stoppard's first play at the National, Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead, in which Hamlet's two doomed school friends ponder The Mysteries of eternity, chance and death. Heads.Heads (and again). Heads. Heads. Yes, one must think of the future. It's the normal thing. To have one. One is, after all, having it all the time. Now. And now. And now. It could go on for ever. Well, not for ever, I suppose. Do you ever think of yourself as actually dead, lying in a box with a lid on it? No. Nor do I, really. It's silly to be depressed by it. I mean one thinks of it like being alive in a box, one keeps forgetting to take into account the fact that one is dead, which should make a difference,shouldn't it? I mean, you'd never know you were in a box, would you? It would be just like being asleep in a box. Not that I'd like to sleep in a box, mind you, not without any air. You'd wake up dead, for a start and then where would you be? Apart from inside a box. That's the bit I don't like, frankly. That's why I don't think of it. Because you'd be helpless, wouldn't you? Stuffed in a box like that, I mean you'd be in there for ever. Even taking into account the fact you're dead, really - ask yourself, if I asked you straight off - I'm going to stuff you in this box now, would you rather be alive or dead? Naturally, you'd prefer to be alive. Life in a box is better than no life at all. I expect. You'd have a chance at least. You could lie there thinking - well, at least I'm not dead! In a minute someone's going to bang on the lid and tell me to come out. "Hey you, whatsyername! Come out of there"! You don't have to flog it to death! I wouldn't think about it, if I were you. You'd only get depressed. Eternity is a terrible thought. I mean, where's it going to end? I don't think you're being very kind. Oh, what makes you think that? You being the cynical author laughing up his sleeve at a gushing admirer. I think you're a very interesting woman, and extremely nice-looking. Oh, do you? Yes. Would you like me to make love to you? Oh, now really, David - I wish you wouldn't say things like that. I know I've knocked you off your plate - I'll look away for a minute while you. Climb on to it again. Oh, really this is wonderful! That's right. Now then... Now then, what? You're adorable - you're magnificent - you're tawny. I'm not in the least tawny. Now, don't argue. This is sheer affectation. Now affectation's very nice. No, it isn't - it's odious. Oh, you mustn't be cross. I'm not in the least cross. Yes, you are - but you're very alluring. Alluring? Terribly. How sweet of you. I can hear your brain clicking - it's really very funny. Yes well that was rather rude. You've been consistently rude to me for hours. Never mind. Why have you? I'm always rude to people I like. Do you like me? Enormously. Oh, how sweet of you! But I don't like your methods. Methods? What methods? You're far too pleasant to occupy yourself with the commonplace. And you spoil yourself by trying to be too clever. Oh you're so inscrutable and quizzical, just exactly what a feminine psychologist should be. Yes, aren't I? You frighten me dreadfully. Oh darling! Oh, don't call me darling. Well that's unreasonable. You've been trying to make me the whole evening. Your conceit is outrageous! It's not conceit at all! You've been firmly buttering me up because you want a nice little intrigue. Oh how dare you! It's perfectly true. If it weren't you wouldn't be so cross. I think you are insufferable! Oh Myra - dear Myra... Ah! Don't touch me! Oh, come along let's have that nice little intrigue. The only reason I've been so annoying is that I love to see things as they are first, and then pretend they're what they're not. Yes words, words. Masses and masses of words! Yes, well, they're great fun to play with. Oh, I'm glad you think so. Personally, they bore me stiff. They're great fun to play with. I'm glad you think so. Personally, they bore me stiff. Myra - don't be statuesque. Yes, let go of my hand! Oh! Oh, I am so sorry. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Wedlock, we own ordained by heaven's decree, But such as heaven ordained it first to be: Concurring tempers in the man and wife. As mutual helps to draw the load of life. View all the works of Providence above. The stars with harmony and concord move. View all the works of Providence below. The fire, the water, earth, and air we know. All in one plant agree to make it grow. Must man, the chiefest work of art divine, be doomed in endless discord to repine? No, we should injure heaven by that surmise. Omnipotence is just, were man but wise. APPLAUSE Peter Nichols' The National Health was the first in a long of illustrious line of what came to be known as State of the Nation plays at the National Theatre. A funny but merciless parody of a sentimental TV hospital soap is intercut with a very realistic portrayal of a shabby, underfunded hospital and a hospital staff that seems intent on doing anything but serving their patients properly. In the second bed from the right is Charles Kay, who played the same role 44 years ago. Good morning, how are you today? GROANS. Keep smiling. You'll soon by out of here. Good morning, how are you today? Morning, Matron, not so dusty, thank you. That's the style. When you consider half my tummy's been? Keep it up. Taken away. GROANS. Good morning. How are you getting along? Eh? Are they treating you well? Not too bad. That's right. Though I'd like to go to a toilet... Sister. You know - toilet with a decent chain. Get this patient a bedpan. Bedpan for Mr Flagg. Good morning how are you today? Lovely, Matron. That's what we like to hear, isn't it, Sister? Get well soon. We need the beds. LAUGHTER You could have waited. What's he brought me this for? You said you wanted to go to the toilet. I said I would like a toilet with a decent chain like I have at home. Mr Flagg don't said he was looking forward to a toilet with a decent chain. The Matron says do this, it's a Royal command. I don't want the bedpan. Come along, Mr Flagg. I have been on duty for 29 hours. LAUGHTER Where's Her Majesty? On the balcony. Who do you feel? Nurse, this patient should have the screens round. They're all being used. Get them in. Coming! Shall I take you off, Mr Flagg. I never wanted to come on here. Now I am on, you better leave me. Oh. Doctor. Doctor! We will aspirate a pleural effusion. Thank you, nurse. He should be on the terminal ward. Ask Strr to arrange it. I will be with the almoner if you want me. Other way if you want to go out. Mr Mackie to the terminal ward. Go for a nice long ride now, Mr Mackie. Chuff-chuff-chuff. Those chairs are anyhow. Put them straight Those chairs are anyhow. Put them straight. The whole ward block is in for a face-lift which I am sure you will agree is long overdue. The walls will be in washable avocado pear, curtains and counterpanes in Cotswold stone. High level louvres on the windows. King's Fund beds with slimline mattresses. Into the jet-age with one big jump. APPLAUSE No Man's Land by Harold Pinter. I remember seeing it with Gielgud and Richardson at the Vic. Then it moved to the South Bank. I can't remember knowing what it was about. But it didn't really matter. You are not supposed to really know. It's Harold Pinter, you just watch it. And when they pause, is it intended? Just long pauses, weren't there? Long pauses. I've done many plays by Harold. If you asked Harold what his plays were about he wouldn't reply. He wouldn't say, I don't know or wouldn't say anything. Just wouldn't speak to you. So you just get on with it and do it. That's all. I don't quite know what Spooner and Hirst represent. I mean, they seem to... Um... Be sort of kaleidoscopic. They can be many, many things at any time you want them to be. One is very rich and one is very poor. And one is a kind of parasitic hanger-on type person. The other is a man who is sitting there drunk. I wish I was playing that part! He never stops talking, your man, does he? Unfortunately, not! I am enraptured. Tell me more. Tell me more about the quaint little perversions of your life and times. Tell me more, with all the authority and brilliance you can muster, about the socio-political-economic structure of the environment in which you attained to the age of reason. Tell me more. There is no more. Tell me then about your wife. What wife? How beautiful she was, how tender and how true. Tell me with what speed she swung in the air, with what velocity she came off the wicket. Whether she was responsive to finger spin, whether you could bowl a shooter with her, or an off break with a legbreak action. In other words, did she google? You will not say. I will tell you then, that my wife had everything. Eyes, a mouth, hair, teeth, buttocks, breasts, absolutely everything. And legs. Which carried her away. Carried who away? Yours or mine? Is she here now, your wife? Cowering in a locked room, perhaps? Was she ever here? Was she ever there, in your cottage? It is my duty to tell you you have failed to convince. I am an honest and intelligent man. You pay me less than my due. Are you, equally, being fair to the lady? I begin to wonder whether truly accurate and therefore essentially poetic definition means anything to you at all. I begin to wonder whether you do in fact truly remember her, whether you truly did love her, truly caressed her, truly did cradle her, truly did husband her, falsely dreamed or did truly adore her. I have seriously questioned these propositions and find them threadbare. Her eyes, I take it, were hazel? Hazel shit. Good lord, good lord, do I detect a touch of the maudlin? Hazel shit. I ask myself: Have I ever seen hazel shit? Or hazel eyes, for that matter? Do I detect a touch of the hostile? Do I detect, with respect, a touch of too many glasses of ale followed by the great malt which wounds? Which wounds? Tonight, my friend, you find me in the last lap of a race I had long forgotten to run. A metaphor. LAUGHTER Things are looking up. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING The next playwright is Alan Ackybourn, one of the most prolific playwright for the National Theatre. I can remember many, among them Sisterly Feelings which I was in, Way Upstream, A Chorus of Disapproval, Small Family Business and Bedroom Farce. He started it on a Wednesday and finished on a Friday. He typed it up on the Saturday. He went into rehearsal on the Monday. Peter asked me to write a play specifically, I said, are you sure you want me to write for The National? He did a Peter-ism, he lent forward as we were having dinner and he said, Alan, ask yourself, can I do without The National Theatre? The answer is yes, but I'll ask you another question. Can The National Theatre do without you? Bedroom Farce takes place in three suburban bedrooms over 24 hours and I think probably that's all you need to know. A damp patch. Definitely. It's getting in from somewhere. I've just been standing on the spare bed in there feeling the ceiling. The verdict is, very very damp. Grub up. Just a minute. It'll get cold. I've just got to take this off. You can do that afterwards. I'm not getting into bed with my make-up on, darling. It may look beautiful in the films but they don't have to worry about the laundry bills. Oh well. Spot of bad news, anyway. Bad news? Sardines were not in evidence. I had to settle for pilchards. Pilchards? Oh. Don't you like pilchards? Well, not as much. Similar. Both fish, anyway. Yes. You had them in stock. I assumed you liked them. I don't necessarily like everything I buy. Those were just stores. For an emergency. Ah, the old siege stores, eh? I bought a little of everything. I think there's even some tinned red cabbage and I certainly don't intend to eat that. Oh well, I'll wolf the lot then, shall I? No, no, leave me a little. Right. Aaah. Didn't put the blanket on, did we? Nor did we. Ah. Down you go. Ah, this is nice. What better way to end the day? Listening to the rain gushing through our roof. It's not raining surely? Metaphorical. These aren't bad at all. You know, I think I could become a pilchard man. I think we're in imminent need of a hot water bottle here, you know. Oh yes. Bearing in mind the normal running temperature of your feet. Not my fault. Most women have cold feet. It's circulation. I wouldn't know about that. I haven't sampled that many. The girls at school did. Well, not the younger ones. Younger girls have very hot feet. Like little boys. But when we got to the sixth form, we all found we had cold feet. I think it's something to do with - maturing. Very curious. Chaps I shared a hut with in the army all had overwhelmingly hot feet. I can imagine. Yes, I pronounce these pilchards a success. Jolly good. Right, here I come. Stand by for cold feet. Darling, you're getting fish on the sheet. Oh, sorry. Now we're going to reek of fish all night. I don't think this was a terribly bright idea of someone's. Oh well. You only live once. What the hell. Well, it's on your side. You have to put up with it. Oh yes, they're quite pleasant, aren't they? Not up to sardines but not bad. They got my vote. At least we're in for a reasonably early night. Yes. Sunday tomorrow, we can lie in. Go for a walk later on if you like. That'd be nice. If unwet. Rather. Otherwise we'll both be crouching in the rafters with buckets. God forbid. That night I heard Mozart's music for the first time. Some serenade for wind instruments, only vaguely at first, too horrified to attend. But presently the sounds insisted, a solemn Adagio in E flat. It started simply enough... Just a pulse in the lowest register, bassoon and basset horn, like a rusty squeeze-box. It would have been comic except for the slowness which gave it instead, a sort of serenity. And then suddenly, high above it, sounded a single note on the oboe. It hung there unwavering, piercing me through, 'till breath could hold it no longer, and a clarinet withdrew it out of me, and softened it, and sweetened it to a phrase of such delight it had me trembling. The lights flickered in the room. My eyes clouded! The squeeze-box groaned louder, and over it the higher instruments wailed and warbled, throwing lines of sound around me, long lines of pain around and through me, ah, the pain! Pain as I had never known it. I called up to my sharp old God, "What is this? What?!" But the squeeze-box went on and on, and the pain cut deeper into my shaking head and suddenly I was running, downstairs through the side-door, out into the street, out into the dark night, gasping for life "What?! What is this Signore! What is this pain? What is the need in the sound? Forever unfulfillable yet fulfilling him who hears it, utterly. Is it Your need? Can it be Yours?" Dimly the music sounded from the salon above. Dimly the stars shone on the empty street. I was suddenly frightened. It seemed to me that I had heard a voice of God, and that it issued from a creature whose voice I had also heard, and it was the voice of an obscene child. APPLAUSE Would any of you gentlemen like to testify? Detroit. We'll hear testimony from? Brother Nicely-Nicely Johnson. Brother Nicely-Nicely Johnson. Get up you fat water buffalo. Well it er, happened to me kinda funny, like in a dream. Tell us in your own words. I dreamed last night I got on the boat to Heaven,.And by some chance I had brought my dice along. And there I stood, and I hollered, "Someone fade me". But the passengers they knew right from wrong. For the people all said, Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat. People all said, Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat. And the devil will drag you under By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat; Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. Sit down you're rocking the boat. I sailed. Away on that little boat to Heaven. And by some chance found a bottle in my fist,.And there I stood, Nicely passin' out the whiskey, But the passengers were bound to resist For the people all said, "Beware!" People all said, "beware, beware! You're on a heavenly trip". People all said, "beware"! Beware you'll scuttle the ship; And the devil will drag you under By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat; Sit down. Sit down, sit down, sit down, Sit down you're rockin' the boat. And as? I laughed at those passengers to Heaven. Ah, ah, ah, ah! A great big wave came and washed me overboard,.And as I sank, and I hollered, "Someone save me," That's the moment I woke up, thank the Lord! Thank the Lord, thank the Lord! And I said to myself, "Sit down". "Sit down you're rocking the boat." Said to myself, "Sit down". And the devil will drag you under. With a soul so heavy you'd never float. Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, Sit down you're rockin' the boat. Sit down you're rockin'. Sit down sit down sit down you're rockin' the boat. Sit down. And I said to myself, "Sit down". "Sit down you're rocking the boat." And the devil will drag you under. Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, Sit down you're rockin' the boat. Sit down you're rockin'. Sit down. You're rockin'. The boat! I never saw Pravda at the National Theatre but I remember it was Anthony Hopkins at the centre of this new play. Everybody was talking about this extraordinary performance. I suppose if I had seen it I would not be comfortable about putting myself in the firing line for this! The play is about a newspaper magnate from South Africa who comes to England and starts to take over various important British newspapers. It is supposedly based on a famous newspaper magnate, we can all guess who. He runs, takes over like a beast takes over the rather genteel and slightly ineffectual British press. You are born into a tragic culture. Tragedy is bred in your bones. A country of almost impossible beauty. From the very moment you are born, the sadness infects you. Like a mist hanging over the veldt. Jackal, giraffe, hyena, lion - the well-nigh unimaginable richness of creation is presented to you every day from the window of your speeding car in scenes of almost post-card-like glamour. Nature is there. In front of you. Childhood, boyhood, manhood. These are special things in South Africa. The hardening of muscle, the sprouting of hair. The coming realisation you are born into a divided culture. No one has tried harder than I through my organisations to untie the knots of the cultural contradictions. Black, white, rich, poor, us, them, but people who come from Europe bearing si police -- simplistic solutions ignore the scale of what we have inherited from Mother Nature herself. What I do is a natural thing. There is nothing unnatural about making money. When you are born where I was born you do have a feeling for nature. What I admire about nature is animals, birds, plants, they f ucking get on with it and don't stand about complaining all the time. We are greatly interested in your mother's share holdings in the Victory. The Daily Victory? Acquiring it. I know what you will tell me. The Daily Victory is one small part of your country you all say will never be for sale. An Everest of probity, unscaleable. An institution like Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London and your two Houses of Parliament and as dismal and dreary a read as it is possible for humanity to contrive It's true, it isn't very good. Your mother owns 21% of the shares. I don't understand, if you want to acquire stock talk to her. It's often hard to speak clearly with Dame Elsa. She's often inaccessible. Her mind is often inaccessible. Her mind is often drifting between one thing and another. Incoherent. Senile. I gather from what you are saying you have already offered for her shares? Dame Elsa seems not to realise the potential of her shareholdings. God, is there nowhere to sit down? Dame Elsa's stock and we own 53% of the shares. Control. Can you just buy a piece of England? You are South African. We have the England cricket Captain. There are trustees with a veto, do you suppose they will let you in What if they did and you are the man that helped me. You are a Member of Parliament. Some backbench lobbying. The right word here and there. You've not much to lose. If we are to succeed a friendly victory will assist your career. I see. As a politician. Not even a politician, no longer a politician. With The Daily Victory behind you, a statesman. Get him a seat. The press and politicians, it's a delicate relationship. LAUGHTER Too close and danger ensues and too far apart, democracy itself cannot function. There must be an essential exchange of information. Creative leaks, a discreet lunch. Interchange in the lobby, the art of the unattributable telephone call late at night, a source close to the Prime Minister, meaning the Prime Minister. Yes. This mutual relationship is a good thing, and if it can be made concrete, formalised by an actual commercial arrangement, if I, for instance, were to offer you my private skill and influence, and in return you were to guarantee me access to your newspapers, if the channels of free expression were to be... Channelled in my direction, if Man Of Steel were to be a regular feature, a column, written by myself, by me, then democracy would be safeguarded. And we would have a very satisfactory deal. What the lock is happening? What is going on here? Christ, I never met such a load of locking shit. It's shit! It's locking rubbish! What do you do? Home affairs, Sir. Where are you? How much have we spent? 150,000 How much does that leave in the fund? 350,000. You're fired. Who wrote this article on Central American politics? Who is it? Is it anybody here. Put your hand up. Sack yourself, please. Spare me the embarrassment no gringo should have to read this kind of stuff. Where are you going? I am going to the lavatory. Use the public toilet. You're fired. Where are you? Have I fired you? No, Sir. Then get over there. Get over that side. All the ones I haven't fired are over that side. Don't confuse me. Where is marketing? They are the worst. Who is this communistic propaganda? All the advertising people must go. Don't even let them take a pencil with them. Search them. I am deputy editor. I have been holding the fort. I trust you find everything to your satisfaction. What is your name? Cliveden Whicker-Baskett. In South Africa there are no men called Whicker-Baskett. The name is totally unknown. Who is this? That's Mack Wellington, the drama critic. Whipper Wellington, he has just been to a lunchtime theatre. What sort of criteria do you use in your reviews? Is it more important the play flatters your personal prejudices or do you make a genuine attempt at objectivity? Oh, God! Did I sack you? No Doesn't make any difference I am sacking you now. Everyone, let's get the news on the street. APPLAUSE I feel very stubborn. I am going to sit it out until that bloody building is alive. I do enjoy a good fight, if I believe it's worth fighting and I am sure I am an adrenalin addict. I like that. APPLAUSE I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony: O, such another sleep, that I might see but such another man! If it might please ye,- His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck a sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted the little O, the earth. Most sovereign creature... His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm crested the world: his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres, and that to friends; But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, he was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, there was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas that grew the more by reaping: his delights were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above the element they lived in: in his livery walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocket. Cleopatra! Think you there was, or might be, such a man as this I dream'd of? Gentle madam, no. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. But if there be, nor ever were one such, It's past the size of dreaming. APPLAUSE The luckiest thing that happened to me when I was running The National Theatre, that I received a play from an American friend and it was a play that had never been performed in America and I started to read it. After I got to page three I realised I had to put this play on. It was a play about living with Aids, about American politics, about religion. It was about sex, love, and death. Which, after all, is the stuff of all good drama. It was called Angels In America. Poor Louis. I'm sorry your grandma is dead. Tiny little coffin, huh? Sorry I didn't introduce you to - I always get so closety at these family things. Butch. You get butch. "Hi Cousin. Doris, you don't remember me I'm Lou, Rachel's boy." Lou, not Louis, because if you say Louis they'll hear the sibillant S. I don't have a... I don't blame you, hiding. Bloodlines. Jewish curses are the worst. I personally would dissolve if anyone ever looked me in the eye and said "Feh." Fortunately WASPS don't say "Feh." Oh and by the way, darling, cousin Doris is a dyke. No. Really? You don't notice anything. If I hadn't spent the last four years fellating you I'd swear you were straight. You're in a pissy mood. Cat still missing? Not a furball in sight. It's your fault. It is? I warned you, Louis. Names are important. Call an animal Little Sheba and you can't expect it to stick around. Besides, it's a dog's name. I wanted a dog in the first place, not a cat. He sprayed my books. He was a female cat. Cats are stupid, high-strung predators. Babylonians sealed them up in bricks. Dogs have brains. Cats have intuition. A sharp dog is as smart as a really dull two-year-old child. Cats know when something's wrong. Only if you stop feeding them. They know. That's why Sheba left. Because she knew. Knew what? I did my best Shirley Booth this morning, floppy slippers, housecoat. Curlers, can of Little Friskies; Come back, Little Sheba, come back - to no avail. Le chat, elle ne reviendra jamais, jamais... See. That's just a burst blood vessel. Not according to the best medical authorities. What? Tell me. KS, baby. Lesion number one. The wine-dark kiss of the angel of death. Oh please... I'm a lesionnaire. The Foreign Lesion. The American Lesion. Lesionnaire's disease. Stop. My troubles are lesion. Will you stop. Don't you think I'm handling this well? I'm going to die. Bullshit. Let go of my arm. No. I can't find a way to spare you baby. No wall like the wall of hard scientific fact. K.S. Wham. Bang your head on that. Lock you. Lock you, lock you, lock you. Now that's what I like to hear. A mature reaction. Let's go see if the cat's come home. Louis? When did you find this? I couldn't tell you. Why? I was scared, Lou. Of what? That you'll leave me. Oh. Bad timing, funeral and all, but I figured as long as we're on the subject of death... I have to go bury my grandma. Lou? Then you'll come home? Then I'll come home. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. The secret mischiefs that I set abroach I lay unto the grievous charge of others. Clarence, whom I have indeed cast in darkness, I do beweep to many simple gulls. Namely, to Stanley, Hastings, Buckingham. And tell them this the queen and her allies that stir the king against the Duke my brother. Now, they believe it; and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey: But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture, tell them God bids us do good for evil: And thus I clothe my naked villany in old odd ends stolen forth of holy writ; And seem a saint, when most I play the devil. My first job at the National was selling ice creams and caring tickets as a 19-year-old usher. But I was in the audience when David Hare wrote his great trilogy in which he examines Britain through the prism of three of its great institutions: The church, the law and Westminster. Absence Of War examines the Labour Party as its volatile leader fights are doomed campaign. Now, let's change the subject entirely, Mr Jones. The policies themselves. And how they change. Let's look at mortgage tax relief. Ah yes. Yes, of course. There is no mention in your manifesto of any plan to abolish this concession. No. No we have none. And yet my understanding is, until very recently you were determined to abolish it. Abolish it? No, that is absolutely not true. You see I've been told, on very good authority, plans to abolish it were there. They were in the draft manifesto. Then at the last minute they were removed. I don't think so. On November 14th, on your instructions, a whole paragraph was specifically removed. No, I don't think you'll find that is so. You mean you're denying it? You're denying this proposition was removed? On mortgage tax relief, it was never my intention-.you ask me, I tell you, I want to be clear?. The truth now, Mr Jones-. This proposal was never to appear in the final manifesto. Ah good yes, now, now we're making some headway, so now you admit it was there for a time. Well? So who took it out? That is my question. Did you or did you not take it out? I did not. Really? Really? That's not what I've been told. Are you calling me a liar? I'm calling you nothing. That is for the public to decide. Thank you, Mr Jones. Walk me away, just walk me away from him - All right, George. What the hell's going on? How did he know? Somebody told him. You tell me, who told him? Who bloody told him? Wait, wait a moment. Whoever told him is going to have to face me. George, Mr Frank would like to say goodnight to you. George, no, George, you're not making this worse. George, oh George, I don't believe it. It's already started, the phones are ringing out there. How could you? He rattled me! How could you do that? I know. You've handed them their issue. LABOUR'S SECRET PLAN TO RAISE TAX. You've handed them their headlines. I know that. Are you calling me a liar? They're all going to use it. Every one! They're going to go for you. He sets the trap and you walk right in. Oliver. Now everyone hold on, let's stop for a moment. I gave you the cards, it was on the cards I bloody gave you, be careful, it said, watch for it, watch for mortgage tax relief. All right. But oh no! You're too vain to do your bloody homework. Oliver. Of course you're standing round wasting time with these bloody girls. You, you're listening to goo-eyed bloody Mary, all these women surrounding you telling you how marvellous you are. Do you not get it? Will you never get it? Giggling with girls who are in love with you. That isn't the job. That's not the bloody job, you idiot. Come on, George, come on, get off him! Get off him! Come on, gentlemen, let's calm this thing down. Feel my belly. It humbles, sir. I had a pair at supper. Two pairs, sir. I will try a Fat. It is hopeless. Lady Townsend came to see me this evening. She wanted to know if she could sit during the drawing room. Sit, what for? She is about to give birth. It is only for two hours. If everybody who is having a baby wants to sit, then it will be everybody with gout and before long the place will look like a Turkish harem. Arcadia is widely regarded as Tom Stoppard's masterpiece. It explores things like maths, physics, literary criticism, the nature of truth, the impossibility of knowledge, horticulture, the cosmos, the behavioural patterns of tortoises. We probably cannot get that into three minutes but here Hannah, a best selling novelist, a mathematician and Bernard, literary critic, determined to find traces of Lord Byron wherever he looks, crossed swords over the nature of truth. Last paragraph, if we seek the occasion of Ezra Chater's early and recorded death, do we need to look far? Without question, Lord Byron in the early season as a literary figure, quit the country and stayed abroad for two years at a time when continental travel was unusual and dangerous. If we seek his reason, do we need to look far? Bollocks. I think it is true. Byron had been banging on about leaving. He was talking back living in February. Geller macro everything moved more slowly than. He was two weeks in Falmouth waiting for wind. Bernard, as a scientist, your theory is incomplete. I am not a scientist. But as a scientist. Nobody would kill a man and then pan his book. I mean, not in that order. It is all trivial. What is? Who wrote what went. Did you say trivial? It is eight technical term. Not where I come from. The questions you ask are not important. It does not matter. What matters is the calculus, scientific progress, knowledge. Really? Why? Why what is? Why does scientific progress matter more than personality? Remap is he serious? No, it is trivial. You're going to zap me with penicillin. Spare me that. Do not confuse progress with respectability. A great poet is always timely. A great philosopher is an urgent need. There is no rush for Isaac Newton. We were perfectly happy with Aristotle's cosmos and personally, I preferred it. 55 years linked to God's crankshaft is a satisfying universe. I cannot think of anything more trivial than the speed of light. Black holes, who gives a shit? Why did these people con us out of money will stop are you against penicillin? I would push the lot of you over a cliff, except the one in the wheelchair will start that would lose the sympathy vote before you had a chance to think it through. This unwieldy sceptre from my hand. With mine own tears are awash away my balm. With mine own hands, I give away my crown. With mine own tongue, deny my secret. The reason why the seven stars are in reason. Monster ingratitude. If you were not my uncle I would have the beaten. Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? Me here at last on the ground, You in mid-air. Send in the clowns. Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve? One who keeps tearing around. One who can't move. Where are the clowns? Send in the clowns. Just when I'd stopped opening doors. Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours. Making my entrance again with my usual flair. Sure of my lines, no one is there. Don't you love farce? My fault I fear. I thought that you'd want what I want. Sorry, my dear. But where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns. Don't bother, they're here. Desiree, I'm sorry. I should never have come. To flirt with rescue when one has no intention of being saved. Do try to forgive me. Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Losing my timing this late in my career. And where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns. Well, maybe next year. The medieval Mystery Plays were written over 500 years ago and they were created by ordinary men and women and the plays basically tell the story of the creation, the fall and the redemption of man. Thou must be slayed... The poet Tony Harrison adapted The Mysteries. Bill Bryden's original production took all of the seats out of the Cottesloe Theatre and his actors playing Yorkshire working people were able to mix with the audience and it was a profoundly religious experience, whether you were a believer or not. Lully lullay thou little tiny child Bye, bye lully lullay. Lully lullay thou little tiny child Bye, bye lully lullay. Hail, comely and clean! Hail, young child! Hail, maker, as I mean, of maiden so mild! Thou has confounded, I ween, the Warlock so wild: The false bringer of teen, now goes he beguiled. Lo, merry he is! Lo, he laughs, my sweeting! Ah! A very fair meeting! I have held to my telling: Have a bob of cherries. Hail, sovereign saviour, for thou hast us sought! Hail, nurseling and flower, that all thing has wrought! Hail, full of favour, that make all out of nought! Hail! I kneel and I cower. A bird have I brought To my bairn. Hail, little tiny mop! Of our creed thou art crop: I would drink of thy cup, Little day-starne. Hail, little darling dear, full of Godhead! I pray thee be near when that I have need. Hail, sweet in thy cheer! My heart will bleed To see thee sit here in so poor a weed, With no pennies. Hail! Put forth thy dall. I bring thee but a ball: Have and play thee withall, And go to the tennis. The father of heaven, God omnipotent, That set all in days seven, his son has he sent. My name could he namen, and on me his light spent! I conceived him full even by God's might as he meant; And now is he born. May he keep you from woe! I shall pray him so. Tell forth as ye go, And mind on this morn. I hope without dread today To see that child and his array. But, methinks, lords, by my fay The star it standeth still. Whom seek ye, sirs, by ways so wild, With talking, travelling to and fro? Here dwells a woman with her child And her husband; here are no mo. We seek a bairn that all shall shield; His certain sign has said us so; And his mother, a maiden mild, Here hope we now to find them two. Come near, good sirs, and see. Your way to an end is brought. Me beseemeth by this place That little treasure his mother has. Therefore to help her in this case Gold present shall I. And I will offer through God's grace Incense that noble savour has. Stink of the stable it shall make pass Where they both lie. And myrrh is best my offering to be To anoint him, as thinks me, The baby's members, head and knee, Yea, all his bright body. Shepherds arise be not afraid, With hasty steps prepare. To David's city, sing on earth. With our blessed infant there. With our blessed infant there. With our blessed infant there. Sing, sing all earth. Sing, sing all earth Eternal praises sing. To our redeemer. To our redeemer. And our heavenly king. Sing, sing all earth. Sing, sing all earth. Eternal praises sing. To our redeemer. To our redeemer, And our heavenly king. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING I have of late - but wherefore I know not - lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises. And indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory. This most excellent canopy, the air. Look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action, how like an angel! In apprehension, how like a god! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING The Allied troops were closing in; there was nothing more we could do. Elisabeth and the children had taken refuge in a village in Bavaria, so I went to see them before I was captured. Out of Wurttemberg, down through the Swabian Jura and the first foothills of the Alps. Across my ruined homeland. Was this what I'd chosen for it? This endless rubble? This perpetual smoke in the sky? These hungry faces? Was this my doing? And all the desperate people on the roads. The most desperate of all were the SS. Bands of fanatics with nothing left to lose, roaming around shooting deserters out of hand, hanging them from roadside trees. The second night, and suddenly there it is - the terrible familiar black tunic emerging from the twilight in front of me. On his lips as I stop - the one terrible familiar word. "Deserter," he says. He sounds as exhausted as I am. I give him the travel order I've written for myself. But there's hardly enough light in the sky to read by, and he's too weary to bother. He begins to open his holster instead. He's going to shoot me because it's simply less labour. And suddenly I'm thinking very quickly and clearly. What comes into my mind this time is the pack of American cigarettes I've got in my pocket. And already it's in my hand - I'm holding it out to him. The most desperate solution to a problem yet. I wait while he stands there looking at it, trying to make it out. Trying to think. His left hand holding my useless piece of paper, his right on the fastening of the holster. There are two simple words in large print on the pack: Lucky Strike. He closes the holster, and takes the cigarettes instead. It had worked, it had worked! Like all the other solutions to all the other problems. For 20 cigarettes he let me live. And on I went. Three days and three nights. Past the weeping children, the lost and hungry children, drafted to fight, then abandoned by their commanders. Past the starving slave-labourers walking home to France, to Poland, to Estonia. Through Gammertingen and Biberach and Memmingen. Mindelheim, Kaufbeuren, and Schingau. Across my beloved homeland. My ruined and dishonoured and beloved homeland. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING A kind of artificial barrier had grown up that musical theatre is something where you kind of check in your brain at the cloakroom, and I do not think that is the case. I have never thought that is the case. I have never seen that there should be any particular division. I think the National Theatre is very well served by doing the whole spectrum. The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. I can't. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. Oh, for God's sake, Higgins. It must be three o'clock in the morning. Do be reasonable. I am always reasonable. Eliza, if I can go on with a blistering headache, you can. I've got a headache, an'all. Here. Eliza, I know you're tired. I know your head aches. I know your nerves are as raw as meat in a butcher's window. But think what you're trying to accomplish. Think what you're dealing with. The majesty and grandeur of the English language. It's the greatest possession we have. The noblest sentiments that ever flowed in the hearts of men are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative, and musical mixtures of sounds. That's what you've set yourself to conquer, Eliza. And conquer it you will. Now, try it again. The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. What was that? The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. Again. The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. I think she's got it! I think she's got it! # The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. By George, she's got it! By George, she's got it! Now once again, where does it rain? On the plain! On the plain! And where's the soggy plain? In Spain! In Spain! The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain! # The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain! In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire? Hurricanes hardly happen. How kind of you to let me come! Now once again, where does it rain? On the plain! On the plain! And where's that blasted plain? In Spain! In Spain! The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain! # The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain! You were a wonderful lover. Such a wonderful person to go to bed with, and I think mostly because you were really indifferent to it, isn't that right? Never had any anxiety about it. Did it naturally, easily, slowly, with absolute confidence and perfect calm, more like opening a door for a lady or seating her at a table than giving expression to any longing for her. Your indifference made you wonderful at lovemaking, strange, but true. You know, if I thought you would never, never, never make love to me again, I would go downstairs to the kitchen and pick out the longest and sharpest knife I could find and stick it straight into my heart. I swear that I would. But one thing I don't have is the charm of the defeated, my hat is still in the ring, and I am determined to win! What is the victory of a Cat On A Hot Tin Roof? I wish I knew. Just staying on it, I guess, as long as she can. Christine. Yes. Must be near daybreak, isn't it? Yes. It is beginning to get grey. What made you jump when I spoke? Is my voice so strange to you? I thought you were asleep. I haven't been able to sleep. I've been lying here thinking. What makes you so uneasy? I haven't been able to sleep either. You crept out of bed so quietly. I didn't want to wake you. Couldn't you bear it - lying close to me? I didn't want to disturb you by tossing. We'd better light the light and talk a while. I don't want to talk! I prefer the dark. I want to see you. You like the dark where you can't see your old man of a husband, is that it? I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Ezra. If you are going to say stupid things, I'll go in my own room. Wait! Don't go. I don't want to be alone. You have always been bitter. Before we married? I don't remember. You don't want to remember you ever loved me! I don't want to talk of the past! I feel strange, Christine. You mean...your heart? You don't think you're going to be taken ill, do you? No! Is that what you're waiting for? Is that why you were so willing to give yourself tonight? Were you hoping? Ezra! Stop talking like that! Wait! I'm sorry I said that. It isn't my heart. It's something uneasy troubling my mind - as if something in me was listening, watching, waiting for something to happen. Waiting for what to happen? I don't know. This house is not my house. This is not my room nor my bed. They are empty - waiting for someone to move in! And you are not my wife! You are waiting for something. What would I be waiting for? For death - to set you free! Leave me alone! Stop nagging at me with your crazy suspicions! Not your wife! You acted as if I were your wife - your property - not so long ago! Your body? What are bodies to me? I've seen too many rotting in the sun to make grass greener! Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt! Is that your notion of love? Do you think I married a body? Look out, Ezra! I won't stand - And I had hoped my homecoming would mark a new beginning - new love between us! By God, I'm an old fool! Did you think you could make me weak - make me forget all the years? Oh no, Ezra! It's too late! You want the truth? You've guessed it! You've used me, you've given me children, but I've never once been yours! I never could be! And whose fault is it? I loved you when I married you! I wanted to give myself! But you made me so I couldn't give! You filled me with disgust! You say that to me! You wanted the truth and you're going to hear it now! Be quiet, Christine! I've lied about everything! I lied about Adam! It was I he came to see! I made him come! You dared! You! Yes, I dared! And all my trips to New York weren't to visit Father but to be with Adam! He's gentle and tender, he's everything you're never been. He's what I've longed for all these years with you - a lover! I love him! So now you know the truth! You - you whore. I'll kill you! Ah! Quick, medicine! Where is your medicine? On the stand! Hurry! Wait. I have it now. Here. Now drink. This street is what the media have dubbed murder mile due to the high number of shootings. It is the world I have decided to set my playing, Elmina's Kitchen. Ash, do you read? They make all the good books into films. You are reading self-help manuals. Reading is for whites? I try to open my mind to different things, what is wrong with that? What you are saying is there is nothing wrong with education? Happy birthday, old man. Thank you. Why did I find all your college books in the rubbish? Why are your books in the bin, Ashley? I put them there. Don't be rude. I do not have time for college. What do you have time for? Garage raise? You wanted to -- you wanted me to take days off to help with locking food. Yellow macro don't swear at me. You want to keep serving plantain burgers, good luck to you. You would like me to punch your lights out so you could walk the streets and say, I told you my dad were in no punk. Why would I say that? I could take you the hell out. You are joking, you cannot touch me. How do you think you are going to live good? Man lives how he can. Put your hand on me now! Put your hand on the! Get off! You know I read one of those white books the other day. The true -- truth is man is a product of his environment. I am trying to change shit around here. It is a dark place which goes nowhere. This is my Jerry Springer moment. Jerry Springer. Jerry Springer. I Lesbians. I don't want this moment to die. Die, die, die die, die, die.

Dance, dance, dance. Seeing someone else All women are whores! Dance! Dance! Take care of yourselves and each other. Dance! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Baghdad tonight, the 19th evening of air strikes. Very shortly after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 I asked David Hare to come up with a response and Stuff Happens was the play he wrote. Freedom's untidy and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. Stuff happens. It was based on public records and eyewitness accounts and only moved into areas of speculation when the conversations that it was reconstructing were necessarily secret. It included nothing that was known to be untrue, it blamed nobody, and it mocked nobody. And it left the audience to make up its own mind, which it doubtless did. My concern is this, Tony. At this moment, just at this very moment, I am finding the subject of Iraq seems to be moving up the agenda. That's clear. It's moving up all the time. Since 9/11 I am getting a strong feeling this is something we can't leave alone. Saddam has to be dealt with. My view is we're moving into a second phase. We did Afghanistan. Now we move on. The second phase. How do you feel about that, Tony? How do you feel about a second phase? I agree with the idea. Good, good. There's no question of leaving him alone. He's been left alone for far too long. This is a guy who gassed his own people. Quite. Quite. You and I want the same things. I am sure we do. The only discussion is going to be about method. Back at home, you probably know, you probably heard, you've been taking soundings of your own? Yes. I am going through one of those periods. You haven't had one yet when political problems come together. Can you give me an example? Well, for example, it sounds silly, but fox-hunting. LAUGHTER Also something called Railtrack. Is that a company... You really don't want to know. My point is this, I am in rough water. There is an accumulation, foreign and domestic, first term is easy, George. 146 MPs have already signed what we call an early day motion. It's a kind of warning. And 130 of them are in my own party. They're expressing their opposition to British support for a US-led war on Iraq. The phrase they're using is deep unease. Deep unease. Now, you and I know we're way ahead of ourselves. Way ahead. Any war, any conceivable war is a long way off. It isn't going to happen tomorrow. Not tomorrow, no. It's an option. That's what it is, an option. To I have to give you my judgment. Please, I welcome your judgment. In the event of considering armed action against Iraq, the British Parliament and I would say still more the British people won't go along without UN support. From the British point of view this has to be approached in a certain way. On Afghanistan you had a coalition, there were tensions, definite tensions, but we agreed on the aim. So it is here. Say more. I have an Attorney skaf General who is advising me that any invasion of Iraq without UN support is going to be in breach of international law. Is that what he says? That's it. That's what he says. In fact, he says more than that. Do I know this guy? You don't. Tell me what he says. What he says is this - even with UN support, any invasion may still be illegal unless we can demonstrate that the threat to British national security from Iraq is what he calls real and imminent. I see. I see. That's putting the bar quite high. Yes, it's high. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Ou voudriez-vous travailler cet apres-midi? Dans un garage. Non, non. Pas encore. Ayez pitie de nous. Dakin. Ou voudriez-vous travailler aujourd'hui? Je voudrais travailler?dans une maison de passe. Oo-la-la. Qu'est ce que c'est? Qu'est ce qu'une maison de passe? A brothel.

Quels preliminaires? Claudine. Quel preliminaires sont sur le menu? A quel prix? Dix francs. Dix francs? Pour dix francs je peux vous montrer ma prodigieuse poitrine. Et maintenant, pourrais-je caresser la poitrine? ca vous couterait quinze francs. Pour vingt francs vous pouvez poser votre bouche sur ma poitrine en agitant? En agitant quoi? Un autre client. Ah, cher Monsieur le Directeur, Mr Hector what on earth is happening? L'Anglais, c'est interdit. Ici on ne parle que Francais, en accordant une importance particuliere au subjonctif. Oh, ah. Et qu'est ce-que se passe ici? Pourquoi cet garcon?.. Dakin, isn't it?...est sans ses?. Trousers? Quelqu'un? Ne soit pas timide. Dites a cher Monsieur le Directeur ce que nous faisons. Dakin? Je suis un homme qui? Vous n'etes pas un homme. Vous etes un soldat?un soldat blesse, vous comprenez, cher Monsieur le Directeur?soldat blesse? Wounded soldier, of course, yes. Ici c'est un hopital en Belgique. Beligique? Pourquoi Belgique? ? Ypres, sir. Ypres. Pendant la Guerre Mondiale Numero Un. C'est ca. Dakin est un soldat blesse, un mutile de guerre et les autres sont des medecins, infirmieres et tout le personnel d'un grand etablissement medical et therapeutique. Continuez, mes enfants. Il est commotionne, peut etre? Comment? Commotionne. Shell-shocked. C'est possible. Commotionne. Oui, c'est le mot juste. Permettez-moi d'introduire M. Irwin, notre nouveau professeur. Enough of this silliness. Not silliness, no?but?Mr Hector you are aware that these pupils are Oxbridge candidates. Are they? Nobody has told me. Mr Irwin will be coaching them but it's a question of time. I have found him three lessons a week and I was wondering? No, Headmaster. Purely on a temporary basis. It will be the last time, I promise. Last time was the last time also. I am thinking of the boys. I, too. Non. Absolument non. Non. Non. Non. C'est hors de question. Et puis, si vous voulez m'excuser, je dois continuer le lecon. A tout a l'heures. Lock. And I'll wager a hat full of guineas against all of the songs you can sing; that some day you'll love and the next day you'll lose and winter will turn into spring And the snow falls the wind calls. And the year turns round again. And like Barleycorn who rose from the grave, a new year will rise up again. But there will come a time of great plenty. A time of good harvest and sun. Till then put your trust in tomorrow, my friend for yesterday's over and done. Ploughed, sown, reaped and mown. And the year turns round again. Get off. You silly donkey. And like Barleycorn who rose from the grave a new year will rise up again. Which one? Which hand? Which hand is it? There! Good boy. Good boy. Hello? What's that? What's that, then? Do that again! Whey up, boy! And whey up, boy! Yes! Yes! And whey up, boy! Phoebe arise. A gleam in her eyes. And the year turns round again. And like Barleycorn who rose from the grave, a new year will rise up again. Good boy, Joe. I am going to find out who killed Wellington. Someone killed her dog? With a fork. Jesus Christ! A garden fork. Ah. I like maths and also I like outer space and I like being on my own. I can create...people. You make sport with my life! In the cause of science! This is your universe, Frankenstein! You need to love! Oh! Oh?! You need to understand what it is to love! You carry on about the future and the great bright world, but you are scared to love. You are horrified by people in all their failings and this, this purity that you seek is a fear of life! What? What is she saying? You are not higher than love, you are not higher than love! You are retarded! That's not a beard it's fungus! Is there hair down there? Or is it all shrunken like a mossy statue of some baby man? Is there anything male about you? This is horrible! Is there a man down there at all? How old are you and not to have had a lover? This is horrible! I can't...I will leave! You're a virgin at your age?! Oh sweet Susie you'll see what you've done, you played in Maddy's arms sweet game and now you've won. I've got two jobs, how did that happen? You got to concentrate ain't ya, with two jobs. I can do it, long as I don't get confused. But I get confused easily. I don't get confused that easily. Yes I do. I'm my own worst enemy. Stop being negative. I'm not being negative. I'm being realistic. I'll screw it up. I always do. Who screws it up? You, you're the role model for village idiots everywhere. Me?! You're nothing without me. You're the cock up! Don't call me a cock up, you cock up! You slapped me!? Yeah, I did. And I'm glad I did. That hurt. Good. You started it. Get off! Come here! Get off! Come here! Get off! Get off! No, you wouldn't dare! Wouldn't I? ! London Road is about a real community in Ipswich that came together and healed itself after a series of murders. It was created from a series of interviews that I did with real people from that community, and Adam Cork set some of those interviews to music by following the real speech patterns of those people. I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets, in this back garden. I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets, in this back garden. And it was a bit of a crazy experiment. I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets in this back garden. Believe it or not. Begonias and petunias and inpatients and things. Marigolds, petunias. We've got busy Lizzie 's and geraniums. There's all sorts in that basket anyway. Petunias in a basket. Hanging basket. And some fuchsia. There is a special name. I just called them lilies. They are a lily type, there is a special name, and for the first time this year I've got a couple of... Baskets. Begonias and petunias and inpatients and things. The going ears and petunias... We've got busy Lizzie 's. Hanging baskets, variegated ivy in there which makes a nice show. And then you've got these... Sky-blue whatever they are. That's a little... Purple one. Rhubarb. The old-fashioned Margarets. The daisies. The roses have done pretty well this year. She gave us an extra point for having basil on the windowsill, didn't she? Hanging baskets. Variegated ivy in their makes a nice show. The old-fashioned Margarets, the daisies. I've got nearly 17 hanging baskets. Begonias and petunias and things. Begonias. And petunias. And things. Inpatients and things. O monstrous! Monstrous! Nay, this was but his dream. But this denoted a foregone conclusion. 'Tis a shrewd suspicion, though it be but a dream. And this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly. I'll tear her all to pieces. Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done; She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. I know not that; but such a handkerchief - I am sure it was your wife's - did I today see Cassio wipe his beard with. If it be that... If it be that, or any that was hers, it speaks against her with the other proofs. O, that the slave had 40,000 lives! One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago; all my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 'Tis gone. Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell! Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues! Yet be content. O, blood, blood, blood! Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change. Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea, whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on to the Propontic and the Hellespont. Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace, shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven, in the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words. Do not rise yet. Witness, you ever-burning lights above, you elements that clip us round about, witness that here Iago doth give up the execution of his wit, hands, heart, to wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command. And to obey shall be in me remorse, what bloody business ever. I greet thy love, not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous. And will upon the instant put thee to't: Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive. My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: But let her live. Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw, to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. I am your own forever. Actors. I never get used to them. They are frightened. But then everybody is frightened. To act is to be frightened. When I used to do it I was always frightened. Throw up before every performance. White -- you were an actor? What happened? Nothing, that is the trouble. Actors are like soldiers. The soldiers fear the enemy, the actors fear the audience. Fear of failing. Fear of forgetting. Fear of art. Olivier ended up terrified. If you sat on the front row you could see him trembling. And besides all that, there is the fear of this building. I worked once or twice with Ronald Eyre, Ron, not Richard. A difficult man but like all the best directors and ex-schoolmaster. He was here not long after it opened. The opening was, of course, disastrous. Ron said they should have moved out straightaway, gone back to the old Vic and rented the place out. Made the Olivier into a skating rink. The Cottesloe billiard hall and the Lyttelton, boxing. Then after 20 odd years of ordinary unpretentious entertainment, when it is shabby and rundown and being purged of culture, and all the pretension had long since been beaten out of it, then with no fanfare at all, they should sneak back with the occasional play. And nobody need be frightened any more. Except, of course, the actors. He was wrong though, Ron. Because what's has knocked the corners of the place, taken the shine off it, made it dingy and unintimidating our plays. Plays plump, plays paltry, plays preposterous, plays purgatorial. Plays radiant, plays rotten, but plays assistant. -- persistent. Plays, plays, plays. A word or two before you go, I have done the stakes on service... Tonight I heard Mozart's music for the first time, some Serenade for wind it instruments. When he met at Quail and shake... Pretend they are what they are not. Words, words, words, masses of words. APPLAUSE. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE.
