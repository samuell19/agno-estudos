What if the rent collector drops by? Will I have to follow you to Davao? I won't stay there for long, so just ask for more time. Ask for about two weeks. The last time you went to Cebu, you said you're off for only a week. It took you two months before you came back here. The two checks you gave me? Both checks bounced. Mr. Echeva no longer believes me. Maybe the next time you return here even my panties are already sequestered. That's why I'm going to Davao, to earn something. Hon, my flight leaves at eleven. What time is it already? Go dress up. I thought you'll drop me off at the airport. Go dress up, hon. I think you're just gonna hide there. You always put me in a compromising position. You don't seem to care about me. You just leave me on my own. You don't even leave a single centavo for me. What do you want me to do? To be a martyr? Sweetheart, are you done? Not yet, just a bit more. Go wait for me there. Sweetheart, did you pass by our house? Yes. They told me you just left before I arrived. For you. For what? Strip down. You don't want to? Strip down now. Here's more. - What's this for now? - Just take it. Thank you. Okay, do it well. Blowjob. I don't do that. What are you? Lucky? I gave you two hundred for a blowjob, so do it. I really don't do that. If you want, I'll just do sensation for you. What sensation? I gave you that money for a blowjob, and now you'll just give me sensation? Fine, I'll give you an additional fifty if you do a good job. What happened? Eden? Hey, Eden, what happened to you? What happened to you? My customer asked for a blowjob. It was just that? I thought you got in trouble. I haven't done that before. Why did you agree to do it? It's what he wanted. You know that I really need money. Alright, alright. Why? Is your father sick again? Didn't he write on his last letter that he was also sick back then? - My, it's getting often again. - No. Plus, Helen also needs money for tuition. I don't know. I keep working hard but it's just going nowhere. Who's it for anyway? Look at me. My mouth and arms are already tired working in that sauna bath, yet my earnings are not enough to even buy panties. Come on, just come out. Miss, some sampaguita? - How much is that? - A peso for one. It's so expensive, and it's blooming already. How about two for a peso? Okay. How many will you buy? - A peso. - Don't, it's expensive. Thank you. You know, Eden, I have a friend who had the same problems as ours. There, she worked in a brothel somewhere in Ma late. Now, that crazy gal is earning. You can earn more in a brothel than in a sauna bath. Isn't that too gross already? Almost like a real whore. I already told you, I'm just doing this job temporarily. Why? How different is that from what we're doing? Isn't it prostitution too? Don't we let our customers touch us too? Sometimes I'm forced into sex. So? If you want, let's try. Even just once. We have nothing to lose anyway. Buy some sampaguita. Sampaguita. Buy some sampaguita. Buddy, slow down. Miss, miss! Why, are you buying? How much is your sampaguita? This? A peso for one. I'll get all of those. Wait, I'll just count them. Just a moment, just a moment. - Hurry up, come on. - Just a moment. How much are you buying? Come on, buddy. No need to be rude. Will that take long? Wait, I still need to count them. Just let her in. Okay girl, get in. There are many - more at the back. - Really? You'll buy all of these? Here. Here's your payment. Get in now. Okay. Yeah, all right! Look who's happy again. - Wow, man. - Yeah! Yeah! Just let me down. Hey, what the? What's with you? What the? Hey, that hurts! Ouch... Ow... What the! I thought you'll buy my sampaguita? Yes, here. Can't you see that? That's fifty pesos. There. - What? Don't I get any bonus? - I said stop! - Don't! I said stop! - Don't be noisy! Just be careful. - Stop it, stop it! - There's a cop. There's a cop. Keep her hidden there. Shut that girl up. - Get out! - Why? - Get out of there! - Get out! - Come on! - Just wait, boss. - Grab hold of him. - Easy, boss. Stop struggling! Do you know those guys with you - in the car? - No. I was just selling sampaguitas there. They tricked me. They got me in their car. Sampaguita? Where were you selling? There, in Ermita. - Sir, are you a cop? - Yes. You came at just the right time. They wanted to rape me. You want me to drop you home? Our place is far. Looks like they're stoned. All of you, take care of them! I'll just send this kid home. Let's just meet at Aristocrat later. - Sure, we'll take care of these. - Come here. What are you waiting for? Let's go. I'm not at fault here, boss. What antics were you doing here? Nothing. She's just our friend. Go ahead, search him. Why are your eyes like that? Had some marijuana, right? Keep quiet. Someone might hear us. Keep quiet. Shut up. I told you to keep quiet. Nothing will happen even if we complain. So it was a cop who raped you. What can we do about that? We're just squatters anyway. Even the fare going to the precinct is our problem too. I won't sell sampaguitas for now. The earnings are not much anyway. What about us? You're the only one we depend on. Come what may. I'll just find a different job. Going already? Don't leave yet. I still want more. You're too much. We've been here for twenty-four hours now. - What's that? - Go ahead, open it. What is this? When will you come back? Well, it depends. If I leave this Saturday, then it'll be the next Saturday. Now, if there's a problem, then it'll be sooner. I'll have Joy come back ahead of me. Your wife is so lucky, she's with you anywhere. Me, I'm just up to Baguio. Oh, stop it. You're being dramatic again. I already mentioned to my client about our damned assemblyman, because he's been asking for a share of my percentage in our casino. - Like it? - It's beautiful. Hey, bring the car here. Hey. Hey, get out of the way! You'll be run over! Are you being stupid? Trying to die? Get out of the way! Of all the places to take a stroll, you chose the road. Idiot! That's right, just stay there! Stay on the sidewalk, don't be stupid! What? If you want to take a stroll, go to Luneta. This idiot wants to commit suicide and is getting us involved. Stupid! Who's this idiot? Buddy, what's with you? That's a woman. Why are you meddling? Who are you? - Picking a fight? - No! Want me to shoot you? Bastard. Go, fight me! - No! - I said fight me! You baldy bastard, go ahead! Want me to slap you with this? Get in! Leave now! Baldy! Buddy, pull over for a bit. Somewhere there. I need to go home now, it's already late at night. Thank you very much for everything. Thank you too, Virgie. The next time I invite you, I hope you'll agree again. Please buy some roses. - How much is that? - Twenty, sir. Hey, taxi! - Thank you. - Taxi! Go ahead. Joy, Jenny, come inside. What were you saying again? Your father needs another operation? My, my. The truth is, I'm getting fed up with that. How many times has he been operated on already? - It's not that. - Don't get mad, but if I were you, I'll let him be for now. Oh come on, Zeny. My father's body is really frail. I've already earned a bit this week, but it's still not enough. That's why I plan to take a sideline. Sideline? What sideline? Some freelancing. Go on solo flight outside, even for just a few nights. Since the percentage in this brothel is heavy, my earnings will be small too. Just like now, we didn't get to work again. What will become of us? Just keep quiet for now. They might hear you. They're strict here. And if mama finds out what you plan to do, she might give you a beating. You know her, goons. That's easy to take right now. And you'll take care of it. Tell her I got sick. After all, it'll be just for about a week. Just until I save up for my father's needs. Baby, wake up now, my child. Your big sister already arrived. She brought many gifts. Come, quick. - Give me. - This is mine. Hey, stop scrambling on those. There are many of those anyway. Go and eat all the noodles. I'll take care of the chicken. Hey, hey, stop fighting. Get plates over there. There are so many plates, yet you don't want to use them. Come here, baby. Come. Let's get some chicken. This chicken dish is what I love. - Chinese dish. - It's good. So, you're also smoking too. Okay children, just keep on eating because your big sis is having some good luck. By the way, Junior has to pay for his tuition tomorrow. Did you bring home some money? I hope we'll have these again tomorrow. It's like Christmas, right? - What the... - So how is this? - Really... - Marta, it will be better if you go to Junior's school tomorrow. Just make a plea on his teacher. You know that I'm already so ashamed at my friends because I need new pants. I always wear the same pair. How about the radio I'll buy? I'm already so bored here at home. You're better off since you're always out. You're always on the streets. Oh, this man's really... Big sis, I hope you'll just come in the mornings so you'll always bring us chicken. That's right, big sis. You're late. - Come and eat. - Maybe later. Don't abuse your body. Men won't run out. Hey, Eden, be careful. Ms. Pearl is becoming suspicious of you. She's been looking for you at the brothel for how many days now. I think someone's spying on you. I've already saved enough for daddy's needs and for Helen's tuition, too. Maybe tonight, I'll go to work. - Is this Excellent Sauna Bath? - It is. Does someone named Eden work there? There is. Josie, someone's looking for Eden. - Why, miss? - She's my sister. Where can I see her? I haven't seen her. We haven't seen her. I'll go now. - Bye, ma'am. - Bye, all right. Beautiful sisters, I'll go ahead. Yes, all right. - Where's our ride? - Here. Hey. Ruben! Ruben, that's enough. Enough already! Ruben, Max, that's enough. Ruben, Ruben, enough. Ruben, enough already. Ruben, Max. Ruben, enough. - Enough already! - Call the cops. Knife! Let's go now! I'll go home now. It's almost nightfall. But you need to have that examined by a doctor because it might get infected. I can't allow you without me bringing you home. You can because just a little bit later, your hands will begin to swell. Virgie. How old are you? Hey, you're not bad. Do you understand English? No understand English. That's a little bit of a problem but it should be okay. Tomorrow, some friends of mine and I are going down to Puerto Galera. Five girls. Why don't you come along? We can have some fun at the beach, get some sun. The whole thing's on me. Yeah, it's a beautiful place. I've been there before. You should come along. I bet we can have a really great time. No understand English. Boss, the one you've been looking for has arrived. Eden, go inside now. Come here. Good evening. So what? I see you're still alive. You seem very tired. Isn't that cough of yours contagious? I had flu, boss. That's why I got to report only now. Is it hard to go solo? What? What do you mean go solo? Yes. Go solo, go freelance, tell a lie, cheat! Here. I listed all the customers you took away from me. There, read it! Read it! Good evening. May I ask something? Why? What is it? I'm looking for my sister named Eden. - There's no Eden here. - Are you sure? They told me that I'll find her here. Isn't this what you call a brothel? This is not a brothel. Look on the other side. Leave now. You're so stubborn. - Go ahead, leave now. - Zeny! Leave now. Your bag. - Helen? - Big sis? I can't do anything. I thought daddy's in really bad shape. And because I want you to finish studies. You know that between the two of us, you're the smart one. I promised mommy before she died that I'll support your studies. I know... I know it's hard for you to accept that your sister's a whore. Helen, if only I knew that even daddy wants to abuse you. Even back then, I should have brought you with me. Daddy's not really bad, big sis. Maybe he's always drunk because he often lost in gambling. I don't know. Promise me. Helen, promise me, Helen. No matter what happens, don't be like me. That'll cause my death. If that happens, I'll die, Helen. Never mind myself. That's finished. We can no longer do anything. What had to happen already happened. We need to survive. That's why you need to finish your studies. Because it's easier to live decently if you finish your studies. I know I'll be able to work now. I'm already in fourth year high school. What's important is that we are now together. I feel better, that's what's important. Good evening, ma'am. - Ms. Montes. - Yes? Boss is having you fetched. He's waiting at the hotel. His trip abroad did not push through. Ruben, what you're asking from me is not easy. Even now, my mind's so confused with what's happening, with what I'm doing. Oscar is not a bad person. - But... - There are things in my life that I want to decide on as soon as possible. But before everything else, I need to know if you'll come with me or not. We've just known each other for only a short time. There are many things about me you still don't know. The same goes about you. Tonight, you will know me. I'll tell you who I am and what I really am. So, it's the Provincial Commander's official report that says there's someone who wants to kill me. Do they know who that is? There's no report about that. Only one person wants to kills me. Sweetheart, why didn't you push through with your trip abroad? I got a report from that damn Provincial Commander that there's a hitman released by somebody who wants to kill me. That's nothing new. There's always someone who wants to kill you, right? Oh my, how many warnings have you received? Keep an eye on that Bokal closely. He's the only one who has a serious reason to kill me. Once you've proven that it's him, kill him right away! That's why, dad, I don't believe that it's the NPA who wants to kill you. For sure, it's Bokal. Didn't you already tolerate that animal in your last transaction? Remember clearly what I'm going to tell you, Johnny. Anyway, time will come when you too will enter politics. In politics, if you have mercy, you'll end up the pathetic one. If I had that Bokal killed last election, we won't have a problem now. Gov, Mr. Fabi wants to talk to you at the bank. I already deposited five million this morning. Let's not talk about money now. What I want to talk about now is who that damn hitman is. Sweetheart? Sweetheart. What do you want to order? Actually sweetheart, I'm full. But I would rather that we take something downstairs. I choose the contracts I accept. One time, it's a priest they want me to kill. Another time, it's a businessman. Since they are not bad people, I decline. Now, governor's my target. But Ruben, you can find another job, right? You can still change your life. This is where I'm good at. I've never failed any of my clients. They give me a huge paycheck. Because I want to save money. - After you. - Take my bags and put them in the taxi. You know, honey, that was really fantastic. There. You know girls where I come from aren't like you at all. I really like to take you back there, you know. May I ask you? I'm looking for a job. May I know who I should talk to? Sorry, miss. But look. No vacancy. - Dennis. - Yes. I'll go now, miss. Please assist the guest on their way out. I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir. Let's go, sir. Thank you. Come again. Yeah, you'll really like it where I come from. What time would you... It's pay time. - Okay. - Yeah, here you go. Thank you, sir. Eden. - Go ahead. - Okay. Get a taxi, okay? Taxi. How about chief? Thank you. Thank you. Miss. I'm looking for a job. I would like to apply as a waitress. I'm experienced in computing. I also know how to serve. It was my job in Olongapo for a long time. - Hello? - Hello, Bess? - Hi, Edgar. - Will our date tonight push through? Oh, yeah, yeah. No, no. We'll go tonight. At last, we'll finally see each other. I'm so excited to see you. Where will we have our dinner? The usual place. You know, you might be avoiding someone. - Will that be okay? - Yes, it's okay. Then I guess I better warn you. We might stay up late. You know, after dinner, I plan to take you out. - All right. - Will that be okay? - Are you sure? - Yes. Pick me up at around seven. - Seven sounds fine. - Okay? - That's okay. - Okay, will see you then. - Okay. - Bye. Please turn on the TV, manang. So, Ma yet, still zero? Still starving. That job of yours is difficult. And it has no assurance. Cigarettes? If you want, come with me. There in my show. My partner split up with me. Went with a German. I don't think I can do that. You can do it. Just a little gall. You'll earn more. And it's a sure thing. So, you want? One, two, and three, four, five, six, seven, and... Maybe the tourists just changed their hangout. That's why you didn't get any customer. You know those Americans. They can't stay in one place. Sometimes they are in Makati. By the way, Rommell ran out of milk. And I also have my period, but I don't have money to buy Kotex. By the way, the son of our friend, - Paking got lucky. - What lucky? Would you believe he was given a big tip by his German boyfriend. Well, that Junior is really handsome. And even when was only nine years old, he already has the looks. Why don't you tag your siblings with you? They might be of use. That's right. Bring them along. I think Mayet's already asleep. Ma yet, are you listening to our conversation? - Yes. - Okay, let's sleep now. Now Edgar, was it okay? Of course. Was it good? Did you enjoy it? Yes, of course. Can you do another round? How long can you last, this time? It's all right Edgar. Don't bother. - I'll see you. - Okay. Good evening. Ms. Montes! Ms. Montes! Yes, why? Good evening, Ms. Montes. I know that you are a friend of Governor Gallegos. May I request you to tell something to him? What is it? Please tell him to be careful. There are people who want to kill him. Why? Why would somebody kill him? Who are you? My name is Virgie. I know that something bad will happen to Governor that is why I need to tell you. Call me, 865-237. Oh sweetheart! I didn't know you were coming. When did you arrive? Did I keep you waiting? Is Edgar the name of your damn boyfriend? What are you taking about? Shit! I don't know what you're talking about. That's what I'm talking about! I like the way you work. You're hardworking. Not unlike others who are lazy. How about you? Do you like your job? You know, employees like you are hard to find. Hardworking and beautiful, too. Have you thought over what I told you the other day? You're wasting yourself on being just a waitress. I'll take care of you. I'll give you whatever you need. So you better decide. Hello! Is this Metropolitan Condominium? - Yes. - Can I talk to Ms. Montes? Bessie Montes please. She is not here. She went to a beauty parlor. Do you know which parlor she went to? But Dennis, we've just met. How can you be sure that you love me? Helen, it's only us who can tell if we really love a person. Right? It's true that I really love you since we first met in our hotel. Is that my fault? Because of the electricity between us even in a place as big as Manila, we still happened to be together in the same bus once on our way home. But Dennis, you still don't know who I am. You're Helen. I also don't know who you are. I'm Dennis. You are always joking. No Helen, I'm not joking. It's only now that I felt this in my entire life. Your face is like a betamax in my mind that keeps rewinding every time the tape runs out. It's good that you came because her sickness is recurrent. I can't leave her. Sometimes she has a high fever, sometimes it's normal. She must eat. Sister, do you still have a high fever? You should take some medicine. I already took medicine, but it doesn't seem effective. Okay then, eat first. I'll just change my clothes, then I'll eat with you. Oh my! I need to go to work now. All right, Eden. I'll go ahead. Hey Helen, I'm leaving! Hey, leave me some food especially the breaded one. Helen, why do you still need to buy these food? There might be nothing left from your salary. It is okay sister, the food was given by Mr. Chiongho. It's free. You know I have stories to tell you. What is it? Do you still remember Dennis, the one I'm telling you about? The one who works at a motel? Yes. You know, he dropped by at the restaurant. Then we went out. Where did you go? Sister, you might already be thinking of something else. We just went for a walk. You should eat now. I think you really need antibiotics. - Oh, why? - Ma yet is looking for you. Buddy, just a moment. Hey, Ma yet! Do you earn much in your show? Oh my God, friend! My boyfriend want to hit me from my behind. He has that big thing. Oh my, it's my type! What did you do? What else? I told him it is not okay. My God, he slapped me with his thing. What did you do? I could do nothing but be upside-down. He even wanted to do it on my nose. I've had a lot of girlfriends Helen, but it's only now with you... I don't know.. I went to bed with all of them but after that it's like... It seems that... I suddenly become fed up. I suddenly lose interest. Maybe I was your only girlfriend, that is of little worth, that is why you're not aggressive, maybe because I'm a waitress only. My feeling is that the important thing is for me to just go to bed with them. That if they refuse, so what? That's how it is with them. But with you, it seems like what's important is like this, being with you, I'm with you talking to each other, happy with each other. It's only now. Do you understand me? Maybe you are gay, right? Gay? That Benjie, The one I often tell you about who visits me at the hotel, he drives a Mercedes Benz car. He wants me to live with him since he's alone in his condom in um. I knew it. You're gay. Doesn't a gay go for another gay? Ma yet, you still need this? No, I'm still okay. I don't really use that. I only use that when we do a show. I'll just leave it with you. I still have to go somewhere. I might be caught with that. Okay then, I'll go ahead. Tomorrow again. Hey Helen, let's eat. Sister! Sister, what's happening to you? I was accompanied by Zeny to a doctor earlier. My illness is not an ordinary one. The doctor said my illness is... a slut's illness. It is already acute. Contagious. How long will you be gone? It depends. I will just call you after my mission. Ruben, are you really going to proceed? It's work. I'll leave this bag with you. I'll get it when I come back. It's my surprise for you, so don't open it yet. Just wait till I get back. If you need anything while I'm away, just call Max. Max. He won't neglect you. His phone is in the bag pocket. Anyway, we will go now. Let's go, Max. Ruben. We'll leave when I get back. We'll get away from here. Take care. Max! Little girl! Little girl, does Ma yet live here? Is this her house? Big sis Ma yet, big sis Ma yet, someone is looking for you. Hey, baby. Oh Danny, good you're here. - Come, let's go upstairs. - No, not anymore. Let's go get some soft drinks. Let's go. - What do you like? - I want Coke. Two Cokes, please. Hey, Ma yet, Aren't you going to finish your meal? Just a moment, daddy. Daddy, this is Danny, my co-worker. Good afternoon, sir. I had a hard time finding your house. Why did you come over? We might not have a show in the club tomorrow. Why? Someone talked to me. The pay is better. If it's okay with you, I'll call the boss of the club. Where are we going to have a show? Two breads, please. Maybe in a hotel. They want a private show. Want bread? What is a private show? Same with what we are doing, but instead of doing it in a club, the show will be in a hotel. Will I just fetch you here tomorrow? Or we'll just meet somewhere? We're not sure yet what the illness of my sister is. But what I'm really sure is that she is not feeling well. Why don't you bring her to a doctor? Maybe this afternoon. I've been nervous since last night. That's why earlier in the restaurant, I accidentally broke a lot of plates. I'm sorry. Don't worry about that. I'll take care of my restaurant. I'll take care of you. Don't worry about your problems. Here's money. Bring your sister to a doctor. Take it. I will take care of you. Just don't forget to bring your sister to a doctor. Just deduct it from my salary. No. It's okay. Just eat. Bring your sister to the hospital. I was forcing your sister to eat earlier. But she was so stubborn. Anyway, I know a doctor in San Lazaro. Free check-up. But she said it's a waste of money to spend it for taxi fare. It's okay, I'll go with her tomorrow. I got money from Chiongho. These might just be leftovers? From Chiongho's restaurant. No, Chiongho had that wrapped. Sister, come, let's eat. Let me open it. Oh Dennis, what are you doing here? I passed by the restaurant. They said you went home early. They were talking about you, that you have a problem. So I immediately came over. It's because my sister is sick. Come in. Sister, it's Dennis, the one I'm telling you about. Dennis, my sister. Is she your sister? Come now. This won't take long. I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? We won't do anything there except the same thing we've been doing before. Bessie, they are here. Come in! Get inside. Good evening, Gov. Excuse me. Where is the room? Here, Gov. You two, stay downstairs. Oh sweetheart, come in. So, Gov, shall we go down now? Go ahead. Happy Birthday! You two, stay there. Let's go, let's go. You know very well my ticklish side, sweetheart. - That's not tickle. - What? Lust! This is something I haven't done to you before. You deserve it. It's your birthday. There's still one thing you haven't given me. What is it? Your ass. Ouch! Dennis, what's with you? Why? I'm getting hurt! - You're too much. Why? - Ouch! Still playing stupid? You may be good, but damn it! Your sister's a bitch! What the hell are you talking about? She's a real bitch anyway. In our hotel, I pimp for her. I told you we'll earn big here. Here's your share. Hide your money now. You might lose it. Ouch! Even if she's a bitch, she's still my sister! She did that for me, for all of us. So I can get to eat, so we all could. So I can study. Think you're better? You think you're better? You think you're clean? Sweetheart, you might be thinking that I've already forgotten about your lover boy. Sweetheart, until now that is still in your head? Don't worry about him. He's just a kid. We cannot dodge that discussion. I know, but not now. - It's your birthday. - When then? Sweetheart, you're such a turnoff. - When? - Whenever. Your watch, your shoes, your perfume, weren't all of those from Benjie? What are you now then? Aren't you a bitch too? We're all bitches! Wait a minute, sweetheart. You wait for me. I won't be long. - Hold it, hold it. - Mr. Lee. Why, Helen? Can I talk to you for a moment? What's your problem? If it's possible, let's just talk in your office. Okay, okay. As long as it's you, Helen. You go ahead to my office. I'll follow. I'll just finish this phone call, but I'll follow. - You go ahead to my office. - Okay. I'll follow. Hello, buddy. I still have things to do. I'll just call you later. Yes, buddy, I'm sure. Dang it, you're so annoying. When I promise to call, I'll call. Okay, okay. Yes, buddy, I'm sure. Helen, sorry if I'm a bit late. But please, take a seat. Sit down. We can talk for a short while only, but we'll solve the problem. So? What's the problem? Tell me, don't be shy. - I'll help you. - Mr. Lee... I'm taking you up on your offer. Martha, please attend to your daughter. She's been throwing up for a while now. What have you eaten that is making you throw up? Maybe you've been drinking cold water even if you're hungry. You're such a stubborn child. Okay, Martha, I'll go ahead. In case Junjun comes by, tell him I've already left - for the gambling house. - Okay. All right children, go eat a lot. Ouch, it's hot. Ma yet, when was your last period? Almost two months, I think. Two months? Don't you think... that you're pregnant? Just put it over here. - How much? - Twenty-five pesos. - Here. - Thanks. Sis? Sis Eden? Sis? Zeny, where's my sister? Go have a bite. Where's sis Eden? On the TV. There's a letter for you. She shouldn't have done this. That lady. She knew that I'll do everything just for her. Will everything be worth it, when she'll just leave me? She's older than me, so she should be taking care of me. It's good that she finally left. I don't care what happens to her. I also don't want to see her again. I don't want to see her again. Virgie, someone's looking for you. You know Ms. Bessie Montes, right? - Yes. - She's there, outside. She wants to talk to you, if possible. Drive. - No! Let go of me! - Let's go! You bastards, stop! Let me go! Hey! Virgie's been kidnapped! Why, you... - Want some more? - Who's that? Hurry up! Go turn to the left! Shoot him! Boss, I can't control it. Just drive straight! Don't stop! Go faster! Okay, get down! Ruben! Oh, my. Run, Virgie. Run! Run! But it's difficult to assure that that's mine, Ma yet. Before you joined me in the show, weren't you out with other men? Now that you're pregnant, you're putting that on me. I was having my periods before I agreed for us to be in the show. You're so stubborn, Ma yet. I already told you, \that's not mine. Look, when you give birth, that might be an American, German, or something else! Danny, I know that this is yours. Damn. Damn it, Ma yet. You've already been told that that's not mine. That's not mine. Why would I have a kid with a slut? Of all the women out there, I had to be partnered with a slut. Son of a bitch. That's enough, Ma yet. Go ahead, go home now. Don't go in the club later. Damn it. I'll just find a different partner. Not an idiot like you! I'm leaving now, mom. Good thing you decided to work again. Your siblings only had bread for dinner earlier. Just bring home anything that can be eaten, okay? We don't get to sleep much just to wait for you. I'll go now. Baby, why are you still awake? My tummy hurts so much because I'm so hungry. Mom, I'll leave now. You go to sleep now. - Let's go. - Sis, bring me home some chicken, okay? - Okay. - Really? - Yes. - Let's go to sleep now. It's already late, let's go. Wait a minute. Shall we? - Sean? - Yeah. Shall we? What happened to her? She seems drunk. She'll wake up later after getting some sense back. This is what Ruben left me. All of that's yours now, Max. But please, avenge him. Here's her picture. Ruben also had my back on many occasions too. Just keep that. You'll just hear of what happened over the news. I'll be off now. Be careful.
