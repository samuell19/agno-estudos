(festive orchestral music) (gentle orchestral music) [Bill] If you're a tourist on vacation, there isn't a more colorful spot in the West Indies than Haiti. You'll fall in love with Port-au-Prince. You'll shop at its famous markets, where you can buy anything from a pair of lizard shoes to a live goat. And you'll sail into the very harbor that Columbus first sailed into on the Santa Maria. But if you've got sunken treasure fever like I have, you'll spend most of your time in Haiti underwater. The San Tam wasn't much of a boat, but she was all mine. Mine! I was over my head in seawater and debts. But we managed to keep her afloat. We, meaning me, and the best one-man crew on the island. Ti Flute and I were bound to strike it rich. That is, if I didn't get involved again with a character like Carl Dexter. Baffles me how a guy who looked like Dexter could have a daughter who looked like his did. She was a New York model who flew down to see what dear old dad was up to. Like the rest of us treasure hunters, he was also chasing the golden mistress. But he was doing it the hard way when he sneaked into the most sacred of voodoo ceremonies, the Dance of the Blazing Iwa. (singing in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (tense percussive music) (groaning) (singing in foreign language) (yelling in foreign language) (rhythmic percussive music) (people clamoring) (upbeat tense music) (soft tense music) (tense music) They only bring this thing out once every five years, but I got it. I'm scared, Ann, scared stiff. What are you talking about? It's a voodoo idol. It'll make us rich. But I had to pretend to be one of them to get it. - That houngan. - Houngan? Voodoo high priest. Kept staring at me. I'll see his face on my deathbed. He knew I didn't belong there. He made me go through the fire ritual. If I hadn't, he might have killed me. Ann, those people put their bare hands on this thing while it was blazing hot and it didn't leave a mark. I did it and... There are tricks to every trade. Look at this. [Ann] Why, these are real diamonds and rubies. [Carl] And the skeleton is solid gold. It must be very valuable. How much would you think a thousand of those gadgets would be worth? A thousand? Or more, probably a lot more. A fortune! Now listen, I need a boat, and a man who can dive. There's a fellow named Buchanan, Bill Buchanan, been diving for treasure around here for years. And he owns his own boat. I want you to go down to the wharf and make a deal with him. Tell him that Carl Dexter has the key to the treasure of the Untamed and can prove it. - Jim. - Oh. Which is Captain Buchanan's boat? Buchanan? Oh, he gone to Devil's Bay this morning. Oh, I wanted to see him. The devil's belly, you mean? Ah, madame, Monsieur DuPuis goes to Devil's Bay, but you must hurry. (upbeat music) Monsieur DuPuis, Monsieur DuPuis. [DuPuis] Madame. Would you take me to Devil's Bay? A pleasure, madame, would you come aboard? (mellow music) Where's Buchanan? He gone on the bottom of ocean. I want to see him right away. You go tell him! [Ann] How long will he be down there? He come up soon. His air is almost gone. (mellow dramatic music) Buchanan. This is the last time I'm gonna tell you, DuPuis, stay off my boat! [DuPuis] You promised to make a payment last week. I can't wait any longer. If you want to talk business with me, find me on shore. Out here I'm busy. I can't wait any longer, Buchanan. [Bill] Get off my boat. Your boat? (laughs) [Bill] I told you. [DuPuis] If I don't get money today, I'll impound your boat tomorrow. [Bill] Get off! [DuPuis] Better come too, mademoiselle. This man's a wild animal. I'll take my chances, Mr. DuPuis. [DuPuis] I'll hold the boat for you. Captain Buchanan. Bonjour to you. You're a new kind of bill collector. You don't understand, Captain. I'm not trying to get money out of you. I'm bringing you business. What kind of business? I want to charter your boat. Does this look like a charter boat? Try the wharf. You've got me all wrong. I want you and the boat. I have a job for you. Lady, I'm not a passenger vessel, and I'm not a fishing boat. And I don't escort tourist sightseeing parties. But this has to do with treasure. Treasure, what treasure? The Treasure of the Untamed. The Untamed? Why, that old wives tale's been circulating around Haiti ever since the Revolution. (scoffs) The Untamed. But he said he had proof. He, who's he? Carl Dexter. Is that thief robbing girls now? Stay away from Dexter. He's crooked and he's sharp. He's even taken me for money, and more than once. It's a good thing he didn't know you were coming to me or he'd have stopped you. As a matter of fact, he sent me here. He wouldn't dare. But he did. You see, I'm his daughter. Why, if it wasn't for Dexter, I wouldn't be troubled by all these wolves. And now he uses a pretty face to try and sucker me again, and with the Untamed of all things. Either he's getting feeble-minded or he thinks I'm a complete idiot. Well, he isn't getting feeble-minded. And may I have your answer? Sure. Hey, put me down. - Anything you say. - (splashing) (laughing) My regards to your father. [Ann] I'll have you arrested. I'll have you thrown in jail. (mellow music) Honey, we've got to have that boat. Then you get it. He thinks very highly of you. Oh, by the way, he isn't at the waterfront. - Devil's Bay? - Uh-uh, jail. - Jail? - Uh-huh. I had him put there for assault. He'll be there and he'll have to listen. (mid-tempo music) (pensive music) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (suspenseful music) (chattering) [Man] American, give me money. (honking) (speaking in foreign language) [Jail Guard] A lady wants to see you, Captain. Well, Ms. Dexter, as I live and breathe. What are you doing here, social work or just slumming? Was my father here last night. No, not to see me at least. But he left for here last night. And I haven't seen him since. Say, maybe he's with one of those friends of his. Friends? - The insane. - (laughing) You're very funny. Sorry to have bothered you. Hey. Wait a second. What is this, the honor system? They made me a trustee. You must come here quite often to inspire such confidence. Look, don't worry about your father. He probably saw somebody or heard something he thought he could turn into a few bucks. He'll show up. You can't get rid of a Dexter that easy. That's very reassuring, thanks. Uh. How about dropping charges so I can get out of here? Why, this seems like a second home to you. But if I don't do something fast, they'll tie up my boat. From what I understand, it's already tied up. Have a nice lunch. (gentle orchestral music) (door clicks) (gentle orchestral music) Mademoiselle Dexter, Mademoiselle Dexter. Mademoiselle Dexter. (speaks in foreign language) [Ann] Have you seen my father? (speaks in foreign language) (dramatic music) (light flicks) (dramatic music) No, no, madam, captain asleep. He won't be in a second. You again? Look, lady, I've had enough of this. Jock! Throw this witch out of here. Wait, I've got something to show you. It's all right, Jock. Where did you get this? From my father. He said you'd be interested. I'm interested, all right. But if your father's playing one of his funny little tricks, I'll... Where is he? He wants us to pick him up off the bluffs at Saint-Marc. - Could be done if... - If what? If I had a boat. Oh, I forgot. Well, if you want to go through with this deal, you'll have to help me steal my own boat. Can we do it? - A cinch. - All right. Meet me on the dock in an hour. Bring enough clothes for a couple of days. Jock! What now? Slight formality. I've got to be released. You are no more the ship the proprietor. It's all right, Toulouse, I have permission to take her out. But I don't have permission to let you. Mister DuPuis is very positive about it. Show him the letter you got from DuPuis. Huh? You know, the order of release you got from him tonight. I'm sad, so I cry, but I can't read. Ti Flute, translate it for him. (speaking in foreign language) This make me happy. She is good ship and you are good man, too, Kapitan. You belong with each other, and I, I belong with my Josephine. She is softer at night than your deck. (speaking in foreign language) I think I see my priest when I get home. (Bill laughing) (gentle orchestral music) That's it, Ti Flute, keep her at 315, and don't let her drift. (speaking in foreign language) (laughing) Hey, what do you think you're doing down there? I just thought I'd hang on and take a bath. Well, get up out of there. Why, am I slowing the boat? Take a look. (suspenseful music) I never heard of sharks so close to land before. They've been known to take a leg off right near the beaches. No self-respecting shark would pass up legs like those. (gentle orchestral music) That's Saint-Marc just ahead. I'm anxious to see my father. I'm worried about him. You should be. He must have stolen that skeleton from a voodoo shrine. I'm not superstitious, but I've seen voodoo vengeance work. (mischievous orchestral music) (axe thudding) (gentle orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Carl screaming) (splashing) [Carl] Help. (tense music) Captain, captain, (speaks in foreign language). [Bill] Let go, Ti Flute. (splashing) (suspenseful music) You don't want to see the rest. The shark wasn't even interested in me. (gentle orchestral music) Have some breakfast. No. Oh, come on. Going hungry's no solution to anything. Well, maybe a cup of coffee, thanks. Ti Flute, a couple of cups of coffee. Get any sleep? Sure. We'll lie in here for a few hours. When you're feeling better, we'll decide what to do. What's to decide? We'll go back to Port-au-Prince. I'll try to find a way to get home. I've got to get back to work. He must have left you a little money, enough to tide you over. No, Dad wasn't exactly what you'd call a good provider. I forgot. I can get home all right. This will certainly bring enough money for that. A man's legacy to his only child. Not much is it? Could be more than you think. There's a very old legend that a tribe of Africans settled in Haiti, and kept all of their primitive African voodoo customs. They were called the Tigri, I think. It means the Untamed. And they acted the part. The Untamed believe that unless they bury their dead with a symbol, their spirits would come back and haunt the tribe forever. And the burial symbol of the Untamed was a golden skeleton. There's actual proof that this tribe existed. They killed and looted, finally disappeared. From that day to this, they haven't been seen or heard of. You mean a whole tribe just vanished in a body? That's right. Well, we better get back to Port-au-Prince. I'd like to make a deal with you? Deal? For that. I'll listen. What do you have in mind? Well, there's a young houngan named Iznard I'd like to talk to. He lives at Luly. His father was the wisest, most powerful voodoo man in Haiti. He probably told Iznard a lot of secrets before he died. What makes you think he'd tell you anything? I'd like to try. I'll split 50-50 with you if anything comes of it. I haven't been raised to have much faith in treasure hunters. Ti Flute, let's up anchor. We're heading for Luly. [Ann] Luly? I'm going to Port-au-Prince. Okay, start swimming. (mellow orchestral music) Would you come here for a moment? (mellow orchestral music) I'm not in a position to carry super cargo. And you can't pay your passage. So, if you don't mind. (mellow orchestral music) Spring cleaning? Some people will sleep on anything, I guess. I warned you this wasn't a passenger vessel. I just want to make sure this mattress isn't carrying any passengers. There, you're holding her nice and true now. It's fun. Lots of things are fun, if you let them be. For instance? (mellow orchestral music) That's it. We'll pretend that didn't happen. Why, it was fun. (dramatic music) (thuds) (slapping) (gentle orchestral music) (soft knocking) Bill? Bill, you awake? How can I sleep with a broken jaw? Oh. Sorry, I slapped you so hard. Forget it. Be something to tell our kids about. Yes, it will. We can tell them that... What did you say? Not a thing. Did you lock your door good and tight? You know there's no lock on this door. [Bill] Oh, that's right. - Good night. - Night. (mellow orchestral music) Captain Buchanan is coming, Captain Buchanan is coming. (upbeat orchestral music) Captain Buchanan is coming, Captain Buchanan is coming. Captain Buchanan is coming, Captain Buchanan is coming. Captain Buchanan is coming. Captain Buchanan is coming. (mellow orchestral music) Captain Buchanan is coming. [Man] Captain Buchanan is coming. Captain Buchanan is coming. [Child] Captain Buchanan is coming. (people cheering) (upbeat orchestral music) Wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave. (upbeat orchestral music) - Is this a welcome for you? - Uh-huh. Why? Oh, they're pretty much cut off from the outside. (people clamoring) Say, you better get the idol. (yelling, singing in foreign language) [Christofe] Captain Buchanan, Captain Buchanan. Captain Buchanan, Captain Buchanan. Christofe. Captain, put me down, I'm a big boy. [Bill] I'll say ya are, you're growing like a maple tree. (mumbling) like you. Yeah, we'll have to have a contest between you and Ti Flute. I win, I bet you. (laughing) Maybe. Please tell me, just what did you do for these people? Well, there was an epidemic here several years ago. I brought some antitox. Nobody come here, everybody died. Shut up, Christofe. My father say you everyone's friend and his. That's enough, Christofe. My father know everything. [Bill] How is your father? He's very well, is with fine now. (singing in foreign language) Always I feel good to see you, Kapitan. I'm glad to be back here, Iznard. This is Miss Dexter and my cabin boy. Oh, excuse me, my first mate, Ti Flute. I am happy. I've got to talk to you. First, eat up and the talk, it will be better. (festive orchestral music) (rattling) (chanting in foreign language) Now, mon amie, you talk what you want. No, Iznard. I want you to do the talking. You steal. Then you steal (mumbles). This belong to... [Bill] The Untamed? You know? I know a little. I know about this. But I haven't the slightest idea what to do with that. We are friend, Kapitan. You will believe me? Yes. Then forget about this. It is better for you. No. You know what it means? I know. Can you tell me? Kapitan, my people owe you much, but I am houngan, high priest. And this secret, it belong to Dombala. Dombala? The snake god? Dombala, the god of air, land and water. The snake is only symbol. You do not believe? Well, do not laugh, Kapitan. I laugh at no man, Iznard. Tonight we ask Dombala. (mellow orchestral music) (chanting in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) You dive now? No. To learn tomorrow. I take note. I'm going to sleep here tonight. When the captain is away, I'm the captain. So, I let you sleep here tonight. (whistles) (boys clamoring) (singing in foreign language) (distant rhythmic tapping) [Bill] With cornmeal ground at midnight under a full moon, Iznard traced the vapor, the symbol of the snake god. The whole night long, they sang the incantations, words with long forgotten meanings that had been handed down from high priest to high priest since their tribal days in far-off Africa. When the Sun rose the next morning, it was time at last for the devil dance, the forbidden dance of the bewitcher, and the bewitched. Good fought evil. And when one had conquered, Iznard would have his answer from Dombala. (rhythmic drum tapping) (chanting in foreign language) (whimpering) (singing in foreign language) (whimpering) (singing in foreign language) (whimpering) (singing in foreign language) (whimpering) (singing in foreign language) (cheering) (rhythmic drum tapping) (upbeat music) (splashing) (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) (splashing) (tense music) (mellow orchestral music) No. No, Dombala (mumbles). (suspenseful music) Dombala give death to those who disobey. Captain, captain. Captain. - Captain! - What's the matter, Ti Flute? Christofe going off alone. It's almost empty. What does the bigshot sent you that night? Captain. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (splashing) (suspenseful music) (mellow music) He's a nice boy, Christofe. Uh-huh. I'm glad he's still alive. Sure. That was a brave thing you did. He's a nice boy, Christofe. And now? I think we're late. Kapitan Buchanan. Come on aboard, Iznard. How's Christofe? He's well. I owe you his life. It is a hard thing to say no to a friend who has saved your son's life. Everybody does what he has to. Yes, that's why I must tell you what you want to know. Iznard, I like Christofe. He's a fine boy. You don't owe me anything, and you have a vow to keep. Kapitan, you are an honest man. Tell me, will you still try to land this secret? Yes. I wish for you. You don't have to do this, Iznard. Yes, I have to do it. We must steer north. [Bill] Iznard told us how the Untamed in need of gold and jewels for their burial ceremonies stole the treasure of Christophe, the slave who made himself king of Haiti. The houngan of the Untamed went secretly to Christophe and brought with him the twin god of good and evil. We needed to find the missing part of the idol, so we sailed halfway around Haiti. Then, by horseback we reached what was once the most fabulous court in the history of the western world, Sans-Souci. (mellow music) It was little more than a hundred years since Christophe had tried to outshine the emperors of France, but now his palace was a deserted skeleton. (mellow music) "Sans-Souci died," said Iznard, "as all things die "that live for vanity and for gold." (mellow music) He told me that when the houngan came here, Christophe was at war with the French. He could spare no soldiers to help regain the stolen jewels. Iznard explained how the two made their bargain. They broke the idol in half, each keeping one of the gods as a symbol of faith. King Christophe hid his idol here, but before he could use it, he became paralyzed. He shot himself on the other side of this court. Nobody knew he had the idol? Yes, no one knew. But by then he was all antsy. His half of the idol, this one, have been stolen. But the thief did not know the secret. Well, then the idol must still be where Christophe hid it? Yes. (mellow music) (banging) (suspenseful music) [Bill] But how did you know? The houngan was my great godfather. Now he must go to the citadel. (upbeat music) [Bill] This was the citadel. At last, I was seeing it with my own eyes. (grandiose music) Christophe's impregnable fortress in the clouds, once the eighth wonder of the world. To complete this one battlement, 30,000 slaves lost their lives. (grandiose music) (dramatic music) (tense music) [Iznard] The houngan made it that these idols sit here. You'll final orient them right between their head. (mellow music) There's no islands out there. It's just mountains and clouds. The island is there. How far? The symbol (mumbles). Here is 10 songs, 10 days travel, (mumbles) beyond 10. 10 days, but for you, who knows? (mellow music) [Bill] Now that I knew the secret of the Untamed, I was anxious to return to the boat and set sail. But it was getting dark, so we decided to stay at Sans-Souci overnight. (mellow music) My friend, I have done what you want. Thank you, Iznard. May I then ask you something? Anything. I hope that you forget this evil thing, and go back home. You will never take the gold. You're sure of that, huh? I believe in the power of Dombala. (grandiose music) (suspenseful music) (mellow music) (hissing) (ominous music) I feel guilty. I feel almost as if I'd killed him. That's wrong. You saved his son's life. He tried to repay you. It was an accident. Do you believe it was an accident? No. Bill, I think we ought to give it up. I'll take you back to Port-au-Prince. [Ann] And you? I've got to go on with it. What's our course? Round the Cape, and we'll head due south, for prints. What's our course? 153 degrees. Ti Flute. Get ready to out bunker. (mellow music) We're making good time, Ti Flute. [Ti Flute] We'll move (mumbles) then we'll have the wind behind. (mellow music) (ominous music) (waves crashing) (mellow music) [Bill] 10 Suns and 10 Moons and still no island. I'm ready to give up. [Ann] Are you sure you stayed on course? [Bill] All the way. [Ann] Why don't we give it another day? I've got a hunch it's right over the horizon. You women and your intuitions. (mellow music) (blowing flute) (dramatic music) There it is! (dramatic music) We've been around and around this island. It's nothing but rock. Solid rock. How about a bit of grog? Oh, I am all ready, my captain. You know me like a book, don't you? (Ti Flute chuckles) Join me in. No, thanks. I think I'll take a swim. Suit yourself. How about a song, Ti flute? We look up then. (mellow flute music) (tense music) Bill, out. Bill, will you hear what I found. It's a big cave (mumbles) wall of rock over there with the strong current running out to sea. It might be an underwater (mumbles). Let's get the (mumbles), let's take a look at it. (dramatic music) That must be it. The entrance to that island is through that cave. We're going in tomorrow. Me go? No, you stay. When the captain's away, the first mate is the captain. And the ship must always have a captain. Okay. Get the yellow wrapper ready. Go pack what we need. Maybe you oughta stay with Ti Flute. [Ann] And miss all the excitement? [Bill] A native spear in your back might be a little too exciting. The Untamed are as savage as they sound, Ann. Better let me go alone. [Ann] Not a chance. Okay. (dramatic music) (splashing) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (mellow music) Let's get into some clothes. We can hide our stuff in there till we find some place to make camp. (upbeat music) (monkey squeals) (mellow music) (squawking) (mellow music) I'll meet you in the clearing. [Ann] Okay. (dramatic music) [Bill] Snap it up, how long does it take you to get dressed? A long time. I'm a woman, now didn't you notice? [Bill] I noticed. (mischievous music) (mellow music) [Ann] Well, what happened to all your savages and their spears? [Bill] Never mind. We'll keep on looking after a good night's sleep. (mischievous music) What do you like? One pillow or two? One will be fine. (mellow music) No goodnight kiss? What, get slapped again? (mellow music) (tense music) (bird twittering) (mellow music) (bird screeching) May I have your pillow back? (mellow music) (suspenseful music) Take your first look at the Untamed, honey. (tense music) (clattering) (suspenseful music) (thuds) (suspenseful music) (screaming) Leeches. The water's full of them. (screaming) (mellow music) (crying) (mellow music) (crying) It's all right. It's all right. (crying) (rhythmic drum tapping) (claps) (rhythmic drum tapping) Looks like they're enacting some sort of a trial. (rhythmic drum tapping) Now I know what it is. It's the dance of the unfaithful. Those two are on trial for their lives. (rhythmic drum tapping) (crowd cheering) (Ann yelps) (rhythmic drum tapping) (crowd cheering) (rhythmic drum tapping) (mumbles) If you can. I'm gonna follow. (rhythmic drum tapping) (splashing) (rhythmic drum tapping) (suspenseful music) I found their burial place. It's a lake. It's just on the other side of the village. There must be thousands of these things. (suspenseful music) Hi, Dracula. Take as many of those skeletons as you can. I'm going after some more. (suspenseful music) I'm right behind you. (suspenseful music) Ann! Run for it! (suspenseful music) (drum tapping) (claps) (rhythmic drum tapping) (clamoring) (rhythmic drum tapping) (gas oozing) (rhythmic drum tapping) (tank clanks) Ann, they gave us a chance. [Ann] How? Try to make a break for it when the oxygen tank explodes. (rhythmic drum tapping) (fire crackling) (exploding) (clamoring) (suspenseful music) (mellow flute music) (dramatic music) (coughing) (mellow music) (coughing) (mellow music) Any better, honey? Oh, I'm all right. Bad luck, Bill. I guess I never really believed we'd get away with it. What'll we do now? I guess that's up to you. I'm tired of chasing rainbows. I chased them all my life. That's strange. One of the things that is not taught me was, wherever Dombala goes, the rainbow goes with it. You mean, maybe we will find it? Maybe we have found it. (mellow flute music) Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. We won't have to rush. (laughing) (mellow music) (flute wedding march music) (grandiose music)
