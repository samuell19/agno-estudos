Sorry we are late. How are you today? You look better. So much trouble fixing this appointment... The secretary said there should be not delay if we are on time. I hope we will not be delayed in traffic. We will be on time, but you'll be late. You'll have to excuse me They are waiting for me. Eveyone has been caught several times in such traffic jams, for which no driver blames hlmself. Meanwhile, no one remembers the hopeless pedestrians, who are in no way responslble for traffic congestlon. Music! -They are still working on it. The baby does not reallze that there is no room for hls pram. And the mother's lot in the mlddle of so many smoke- emltting vehicles is nothing but poisonous fumes. Is the length of the narratlon Ok? -Muslc! Oh, oh, oh... is this real smoke? It's a secret; whichever I say it ls artificial, you'll have to accept as artificial. Telephone call for Mr. Modabber. It must be Kian, my wife. Oh... Her mom is ili. Shall we stop the film? Just two words. Hello! Did you have to walt long? Really? Hold on a mlnute. The only way to save our living space is to cut down on the number of private vehicles, which expanding the publlc transport system. Each private automoblle squeezes out a dozen pedestrians; and as it waits for the congestion to ease, It keeps emltting dangerous chemlcal effluents into the alr. Hello! -Go on. I'm listening. Section four. This is an lmage of the future predlcated for the industrlal world when people wlll have to wear safety helmets and makes in order to walk along clty streets. What? You were saying something. Hello... hello We can't run the film a second time. We finished at five. Who's ili after all? Your mom or your dad? Please spell the name of the medlclne which you cannot find. The main scene. Too late! -Who will accompany whom home? I'll give you a ring when you get back home. We should make a film on how not to mix one's work with one's private life. It has been already done a hundred times. -Then it must not have been done will enough. Was it a bad news? You mlssed several scenes. They say they cannot run the film agaln. Shall we contlnue on the edlting table? We should have done that from the beglnning. Ok, you may stop. What are you looking for? A certain medicine. The scene speaks for itself. No narratlon requested. Ok? Then just music. This smoke is too artificial. -Really? It's the only real one. Section five. The idle running of engines, the deafening cacophony of sounds, the continuous vibrations of thousands engines, not only gradually polson a whole clty, they create a vey strong nervous tenslon... I felt dlzzy. The narration sounds too serious It lacks feeling. Ok. So what? Why not get the professlonal people to deal with the technlcal stuffs? Such as a doctor who is working on pollutlon, or the head of the toxlcology ward. Intervlews? Done a hundred times. With some narration interspersed, you can out from one to the other. I would prefer the lndirect approach too. Ok, we can ty it. We have the means. Then this will put the film on the shelf for a while. Off we go! We will look at it from this new angle tomorrow. t We will need a cameraman a sound recordlst and first of all, a productlon manager. Whlch way are you going? -Dear fellow then you will give me a buzz? -You'll be here tomorrow? Tlll tomorrow then. -Ok. We were not supposed to do that. -Stop it. Take it easy. Yes. -It's as usual. What do you want to do? Hello! -How many times did it? -You make us crazy. Shit... How much? Till' then? Hello! Hello! It is not tolerable. Do you know how much does lt cost now? -Calm down now. The taxi is here. Yes? -Kian. Hello! Where are you? -You were not expecting my call, were you? Why yes. You sald you would call. Are your parents still there? They've just left. Why? Is there something wrong? Perhaps there ls, but I don't know what. Am I not being secretlve? No l'm not. I am looking for a red Paykan. Do you know anyone who owns one? A red Paykan? -Does it sound strange? Why should a red Paykan sound strange? What are you driving at? Come on Modabber! Explain yourself. The magnifying glass that I use for lip - reading of film - frames, I can't find it. Have I left it at home? My God, the mllk is bolling over! Bye, you will be home soon? You are sulking. You are far cy from your happy and smlling self. Shall we go to the cinema? -No. Shall we go out for dinner? -No. Aren't you going to tell me what is the matter with you? - I will. You are sulking. When did you get home? -Just now. So quletly! -Should l have announced myself? The medlclne that you were looking for. For your dad or mom, whichever. I love them equally, one as much as the other. Your dad! But it is not an acute case, is it? It should be contalned after a perlod of treatment. There are worse things that cannot be cured with treatment. Sit down. I didn't know you had a khakl manteau. A what? -A khaki manteau. I have nothing in khakl. Really? Why don't you help yourself to some food? -I am not hungy. You mean the dlsease is fatal? Whose disease? -Whose indeed! Are you ill? Don't be late. Is it bad? Come on. Did you tidy up wardrobe? How come my things were scattered all over? Now I am sure you don't have a khaki manteau. Why is this so important? You would look vey nlce in one. How can you say that before seeing me ty one on? Is there anyone who has? Who has what? Llfe in such matchbox dwellings should be vey boring. Don't you get bored sometimes? Perhaps you need some amusement. There are plenty of books. How about today? I may dellver the medlclne. Ouite a trip! If you had your own car, what color would you prefer it to be? Why should the color of the car matter? Do I bore you? What's the matter with you? - me? With me? Is your headache better? -Wouldn't you want it to be red? How about selling our Jalopy and buying a red Paykan instead? What dlfference would that make? -Oh, yes... Then the dlfference is in who slts behlnd the wheel! What are you tying to say? I don't get it. -Since when? No, I will not say anything now. Not for the time being. When did it all start? When did it all start? When? When did it all start? I thlnk... I thlnk it started on the day when l went to vlslt my frlend where she works. I was looking for a job, which they sald was avallable. But I was frightened by the sound of a baby cying. A baby? It was calling me. Just like some place you have seen in a dream, then you reallze that it has a real place and has exlsted all along. A bad memoy? Memoy? -A bad memoy? Good morning. -This is Kian Modabber. I was supposed to ring at this hour, I want to ask if there was any message for me. -Hold on a second I'll have to ask. Oho! What are you doing here? Llsten Vejdanl, what would you do if you saw something that you could not belleve? I would ty to see it a second time. That's exactly what I did last nlght. I came back and looked at your film a second time. Our film? What do you mean? Please slt down and concentrate. What do you see? -What should I see? Who's she? I don't know? -She's my wife, and this man is someone I don't know. Oh... You have seen my wife. Just once. I didn't have a clear memoy of her. But now that you mention it, yes. It's her all right. I was feeling a sort of anxlety in her, She had become vey qulet and retlcent, even recluslve. I thought this was because of her mother's or her father's lllness. But... now... What can I say? Have you talked to her? When I looked at her, l was no longer sure. That's why I came back here today. But I am sure now. I'm sory I had not notlced her. Perhaps you can help me find out what's going on. t Please let me know the locatlon, the time and the date of this shot. How can I find out these information? Well, these are all included in the scrlpt-girl's notes. Please come here and look at the film. It made me crazy. Before we can see the car's number, plate you cut to a traffic light. The orlglnal footage must be longer. I'll have them find the beglnning and the end of the shot. Hello! What's going here? We're going to view something on the screen, Rahmati. And we must find some materlal in the unused portlons of the footage. -What on earth? I'll go on to the cafeterla so that you may work in peace.

What did you tell hlm? - I told hlm this was in connectlon with a stolen car. But I don't thlnk he belleved me. Don't you thlnk you are over - reacting? Perhaps it will be nothing lmportant. By the way, I also found this. It has been taken at the same locatlon. I have a questlon Modabber. Have you thought of the consequences of your action? If you are proven right, or wrong? Here you are. Do you have a moment to talk, Kian? There is no milk on the stove? Then thlnk well before you answer the questlon l'm going to put to you.

Crimson, Ruby. You are a real expert. The number plate! The M in the number indicates that it was registered towards the end of the year. Hey, what's the matter? I wish she was here herself. You may ask her to come, but then the matter will be no longer confldentlal. I have a feeling eveybody knows already. Who's the lady? Contain your curiosity, Rahmati, our friend is in a tight spot. She's not home. You're an expert in Ilp - reading. What are they saying? I trled to find out. But the wlnd - shleld makes it vey dlfflcult. If you want to check something in the Trafflc Department, I have a frlend there. Really? -In fact he ls some klnd of relatlve. You may stop now. If we give them the partlculars, they will say who the owner is? It will take about 24 hours. -Not for a close relatlve. If you go there in person? Hello, operator.

According to the notarlzed copy of sales papers the car belongs to Mr. Homayun Hagh-negar. But I am not authorlzed to give hls address, Instead of governmental offlces.

But he mlght sell hls car recently. You can also tell him that his car tax is overdue. Hello! Hello! Hello! Yes, a glft, for good - nelghborly relatlons. I suppose you know your nelghbors. More or less. The people opposltes, those with the red Paykan? Are you also interested in antlques? Depends on the price. Secondhand goods and antiques are vey good business these days. Rlch people do this Job more than others. Then they must be doing well. Your package. Serlously speaking, are they reputable people? Excuse me. What do you take me for? Our neighbors trust us. I only told you what l have seen with my own eyes. No one can know that how the others are splrltually. I am not responslble for anything. If you do not requlre the manteau... -No, no, that's Ok. Forget it. Here you are. -Hello, slr! My name is VeJdanl. I'm calling from TV. Yes, what can I do for you? We're making a documentay on antiques, and wondered if we could draw on your expertlse. So klnd of you. But there are more knowledgeable people. What did you have in mind? Oh, such things as how one determines if an obJect is fake or genuine, how old it ls, and lf lt has been restored. And posslbly to shoot some footage in your workshop. I really don't know how I can be of any asslstance. Whould it not be better if we discuss the matter in my offlce tomorrow? Certalnly, if only you give your address and your phone number. What did you say your name was? -VeJdani. It was a pleasure. Good nlght. Oh... You've Just come back, where from? From... Pharmacy. You take tranqulllzers? Yes. Who's calling? Sometimes I thlnk I 'm somebody else. Sometimes I thlnk I am not me. Nobody gives an answer. One has to flle a formal request. The answer they give you is not rellable. Why are old records burned? Who was it? No one. Wrong number. But you spoke with someone. My old schoolmates have found one another. They're going to have a reunion. They also want me to attend. Why don't you? Should l? Perhaps I will, yes. Then what was wrong? The fact that I was born. t Come here and ty this on. -What is it? Oh... Are you surprised? Is it for me? So nice of you. I thought it would please you. Now, let me look you Yes, no mistake. What? I had made no mlstake. Supper? -Can't. Isn't there something you want to tell me? I asked you a questlon on the phone. Have you got the answer? What about? -52 days ago, on the?th of October, at 10 in the morning, somewhere between Zartosht and Karim - khan street. Something happened there? -You were there. Oh yes, you sald so before. I have thought about it. -Well? I don't remember anything. The red Paykan? Not a thing. -But this is not something that you forget. People always remember important things. Important things? What klnd of pills do you take? They give me rellef. What is it that bothers you? My head aches. From thunder and lightning. A dog barks inside my head. I don't know when this has started but my God, what has put you into this misey? Who? I don't know what you are talking about. It hurts my eyes. -I want to change my Job. I want to deal in antlques. I want to change my Job. What do you say? Do you Ilke antlques? I have never owned any. I don't know. Don't sleep Kian. I have to talk to you. Kian! Kian! Kian! What... There was no news about you. We are acting on your advice; we are going around shooting interviews. What have you up to? You will be surprlsed If I tell you that I have had an ldea for making a documentay on the antlque buslness. Does this appeal to you? -Why, yes; but how did you get this ldea? Well, this is one group we had forgotten. It should be an interesting Ilne of buslness. -Yes, at least it is novel for us. I have obtalned a tentatlve agreement from a party at this end. -Leave the rest to us, Ok? If we don't meet in the next few days, you have my number. Yes, l'll leave a message. I have warmed the mllk. I'm leaving now. I won't phone, so as not to dlsturb you. Mr. Hagh-negar? -Please state your buslness. I have an appolntment with Mr. Hagh-negar. -To buy or to sell? Nelther, l'm Just curlous. Imposslble. The master has an appolntment with televlslon. He has given strlct orders not to be dlsturbed. Well, I am the man from TV. So! Who did you say? -Please tell hlm VeJdanl. Master. A gentleman's here by the name of VeJdanl. God knows if he is telling the truth. He says he is from TV. What should I do with hlm? Down. Wich way? You'll find it. Excuse me. -Please. Take a look. I'll be back soon. -All right. You must to be Mr. VeJdanl. Yes? Pleased to meet you. I've been sent by Mr. VeJdanl. You are? My name is Modabber. -Pleased to meet you anyway. Does my name ring a bell? Ah, yes, I must have seen you on TV screen once or twlce. Hardly ever. We work mostly behlnd the scene. I was told you were interested in antlques, and how one can determine their age and genuineness. Cigarette? Usually we do not smoke here. -Ah, yes, it may start a flre. It has happened once, and we do not want it to happen agaln. It would be a great plty if the frult of so much taste and talent was destroyed. Please excuse me. Well... You wonder how so many obJects have found their way to our county. From Safavle times onwards, European kings have sent many preclous glfts to Iranlan courts. Likewise European warehouses are not devoid of our obJects. Besldes, we are an old natlon with its tradltlon and hlstoy. Several generatlons of travelers have bought back the best items they could find. How can you tell a fake obJect from a real one? With my eyes shut. We know the histoy of evey obJect and the number of items it has changed hands. This shleld was made for Shah Ismall; it has changed hands 17 times. This Ottoman musket was captured by the Iranlans in the battle of Chaldoran. This clock was presented to Naser - ed - dln Shah by Oueen Vlctorla. People were beheaded with this at the time of Nader Shah. -Really? What do you think? Some people belleve this ls a graveyard of memorles. Others conslder it a historlcal archlve. -Oh... I'll be back. Is this place sultable for your purpose? Oh, yes, it is. What have you found? No, that is not too old. 15 years maxlmum. The prlce, what would be the prlce? No, price can be set on it. It is not for sale. In fact, this belongs to my wife. Where were you? I sald where were you? Now I understand. The pills l bought you yesterday are still here. The bottle has been opened and some pills taken. You didn't accompany your parents to the doctor. They accompanied you. You are the patient, you! I contacted your doctor. He conflrmed this and sald you suffer from anxlety. What's your anxiety from? What are you hlding from me? Tell me, I can take it. Perhaps this is all my fault. I neglected you and you withdrew from me. What happened to you? Don't bother yourself. If something has happened, l want to know about it. Well, never mlnd. From now on l'll ty to be home mo're often. It's because of this damned Job that does not nlght or day. Come on, let's go for a drlve together to watch autumn leaves falling. Don't you Ilke it? This street is called Zartosht. We are reaching the intersectlon of Karlm khan. Why should a shop - owner resort to a hundred excuses to refraln from selling a plcture. The answer must be here. I want to know if you find anything of speclal interest here. The clnema which is always showing a medlocre film? The dress shops? The restaurant where one can meet a friend? Or the expenslve hotel where a room with a double bed costs a great fortune? Which one is it? Whlch one that I can not guess? Do you have a rendezvous somewhere here? Why did we have to come to this congested place? For a drive! How do I look? Were your eyes uncomfortable? -They are now, ever since l have put these on. Why have you? -To please you. I hate dark glasses. Where are we going? What about here? Does it look famlllar? Where are we? I want to buy you some flowers. Ugh! All my money went for the purchase of the glasses. Who asked for flowers? Hello operator, Modabber here. Your servant. -Like wise. Whould you get me the number now? My phone book is all mixed up. Would you ask them where they are first? Thank you. -By all means. Yes? -Now, what business have you with an orphanage? How is that? -The number you gave is an orphanage. Shall I put you through? An orphanage? -Hey, Hey... No, thanks. Then it must be the other number. I told you that all numbers are all mixed up. -No harm done! An orphanage! Yes? Your number. It is the archlve of the Publlc Records Offlce. Where? -Record Office. I don't get it. Where? -Where they flle all the blrth and death certlflcates. At your servlce during all the prescrlbed hours. Each person, in the course of hls or her life has been given a puzzle to solve, In which someone is shown ln the mlddle of a maze and you are asked to find the way out. Come on Kian, answer the phone! Your servant. -So sory, it's me again. Your command? -Thank you. I cannot get through to our house. I get constantly a busy slgnal. Wlll you ty it? With pleasure. Anything else? You are a real pal. -Your servant. May all nulsances callers go to hell! I want to speak with Mr. Hagh - negar. Who's calling please? - I came to your place from TV yesterday. Then when are you coming over to shoot? Isn't the master in? l wanted to fix a time with hlm. Wlth whom are you going to fix the time? The master should be here. Then what you mean is that the master is not in. The master had a more important engagement. Now when are you coming to shoot? Yes? Excuse me madam. I called the offlce of Mr. Hagh-negar, but he was not in. I am calling from TV. My husband has told me about lt. You are Mr... -Modabber. Do you know where I may find hlm? He may be anywhere. He may have gone on a house call. A house call? -To appraise the objects that are going to be auctioned. Is it lmportant? I don't know how to put it. I saw a female portralt in the shop yesterday. It appears that I need your Ok in order to purchase it. I want to give it to my wife on her blrthday. Yes, he told me that someone was interested and we laughed a bit. But you cannot buy it. -Why not, is it vey expensive? No. in fact it is not worth anything, except for me. It is a part of our personal belongings. It was taken to the workshop to be reframed and it has stayed there. It is not the work of any well - known artlst. It is my own work. -Ah! Begging your pardon. Mr. Hagh - negar should be congratulated for collecting the best of evemhing. Was there anything else? This phone call was really meant to warn Mr. Hagh-negar that we shall be lmposing on hls hospitality We are going to film the lntervlew in your house. Has he agreed to this? -Well, lmpllcltly. We shall drop in early in the evening, so as not to dlsturb hls dally routlne. I'll certalnly tell hlm. -Then untll tomorrow, Mrs. Hagh-negar. Hello operator. No luck? Why is your house busy all the time? Hol on, and l'll let you hear for yourself. Oh, then this is the word! Yes, that's it. Your house. Are you well? The phone was busy all through the day. My old schoolmates. They were calling about the reunlon. Your schoolmates? Did you find your magnlfying glass? -Yes, why? Where were you last week, that is on November 22nd at eleven in the morning? I? -And with whom? That's more important. Why? I don't remember. Then why should I remember where I was 52 days ago? A rlddle! But I now remember. On that day, at 10 in the morning, I was sltting by myself where you are sltting now. I was alone. I am not complalning, and don't look at me Ilke that. That word was auction. The man tells the woman the auction has started. We are going to be late for the auction. Have you ever take part in an auction of valuable obJects? Have you ever used your malden name? What does that mean? -Once you were looking for a Job. I got bored. - I say go to this reunlon. People find dlfferent ways to amuse themselves. I have a frlend called Hagh - negar. Hls wife does painting. If you get bored doing nothing in the house, why don't you find a Job somewhere, for instance in an orphanage? What happened? What happened? Did I say something wrong? A friend of mine works in the orphanage. Yesterday, once agaln l went to vlslt her. Well? You should not have torn that page. The number was that of the Publlc Records Offlce. My friend said that their archive was in good order. Then there is something wrong with you. A husband and wife should have nothing to hlde from one another. Do you belleve in that? Then we agree that both should speak the truth. What's wrong with you? l thlnk you are hlding something. Let me put in this way. Besldes me is there anybody else l'n your life? What nonsense! -We agreed to speak the truth, right? Is there anybody else in your life? I don't understand. -Why? It is vey slmple. Is there anybody else or lsn't there? Well, there is my father. -Apart from hlm! My parents. -No, no. Someone I don't know. I feel there's somebody between us. Between us? -Someone that you are hiding from me. Oh, I apologize. I was not hlding anyway. I was going to tell you. But, just now, I am still confused. No, wait. Don't say anything. Think first. Then there is really someone? Well, yes. A baby, our baby. A baby? They say so. The doctor, the test. They all say a baby is on the way, coming from afar. Oh, the news did not make me happy either. But I am happy. Vey! Only I was not expecting it at this moment. A baby's coming. Nobody is expecting it. Nobody's happy for its arrlval. And the baby doesn't know. I must thlnk. Why aren't stray taken to the pound? I am under observatlon. From all sldes. There is no escape. You sald a glass cabln? Those white uniforms! -Such as ours? You don't want to place the baby in an orphanage. Do you? You are afraid of darkness. I can get used to the light. Go to sleep. Have no fear. I'm here. Were you looking for something among the photographs? What will you do if you find out that I am not who you thlnk I am? Tell me evemhing. Who are you? Are you the person that I thlnk you are? No, I was not being inqulsltlve. I was worrled for you. I was not keeping watch on you. For sometime now I have been thlnking of buying something. I was to know your oplnlon. Excuse me. -Please Hello, Mr. Modabber. I've recelved your message. It's tonight. Isn't it? -Yes. Early in the evening. My wife forgot to tell you that we have a small celebratlon of our own tonight. Really? -No problem. Your coming in a way will be the lcing on top of the cake. -We are a small crew: a sound recorder, a cameraman a lighting technician and the director. I hope it will be worth the trouble. What I mean is that you will not be disappolnted in my knowledge of antlques. Excuse me. Yes. Would it not have been better to shoot the intervlew here? No amount of explanatlon can replace the obJects themselves. -Of course The maln scene will be here. But we would requlre addltlonal equlpments. Tonight we shall discuss the matter with the director and fix a time with you. The helmet of Uzun Hassan. The stirrups of Sultan Mahmud. The seal of Chengiz Khan. The past histoy of whole world is here. Please, excuse me. What is it? Ok, Ok. Please forget evemhing. Where are your pills? Home? What can I do for you? I am the intervlewer with the film crew from TV. You are Mr... How is it posslble? I beg your pardon? -Modabber. -Yes. It seems that I have known you for years. We spoke on the phone yesterday, about the painting that you wanted to buy for your wife's birthday. Oh, you are flnally here Mr. Modabber. Is anything wrong? -I am amused by your place. Yes, the atmosphere is vey dlfferent from the antlque warehouse. Would that matter? By no means. The contrast may even help. Where are the others? -I got in touch with them a short while ago. They are on their way. May I make a telephone call?- Go ahead. Do feel at home. Hello, Kian. I'm going to ask you a favor. Yes. I am all right. Please, jump into a taxi and come to the address l'm going to give you, nothing is wrong. You should know the address. It is where I bought you some flowers the other nlght.

Is the intensity of light unlform all over? This way. What an amazing business. Your voice madam, and your voice, sir. I wish someone would tell me what's going on. Anyway, it doesn't concern me. But l don't understand what's happening. Neither do I. -We were supposed to talk about antiques. Isn't that right? I wish someone would tell me what's going on. Anyway, it doesn't concern me. But I don't understand what's happening. -Nelther do I. Nor I. Well, what are we walting for? Please allow your wife to open the door. Is it the house of Mr... Kian. Kian. Now I know the meaning of orphanage, the meaning of Publlc Records Offlce. Then the old man and woman are not her real parents. I... When I was a child, in very early childhood, I had a sister. Later whenever I asked about her l was told she was away on some tilp. Mother! Father was dead, and there was no bread. No... No... All my life I felt I had taken someone else's place. All my life. All right now, Vida. It was not your fault. I've not taken anyone else's place. I had a place of my own. Didn't I? One too many... One too many... I could have been in her place. Why? Why? Mother labored all her life to bring me up, but she yearned for the child she had lost. Why did she have to choose between her children? There was really no cholce. Do you see, Kian? Winter is already here. It's cold. Shall we go Kian? We are going to call on the man and woman who adopted you from orphanage. Father and mother. Something I haven't had for years. Why are you leaving so soon. This is your own house. We have much to talk about. -Yes, of course. But not now. Perhaps some other time. Your address... you didn't say where we should send the painting. Happy birthday Kian. I had all but forgotten. The end
