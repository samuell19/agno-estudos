What do you say, caxton? Not yet. But it's getting late, and they're going back to the big house in a minute. Stop bellyaching, will ya? I promised to get US out of here, didn't I? Sure. Now, look, you pick a fight with one of the men. When the guards come over to break it up, I'll make my get-away in the dirt wagon. Sure, caxton. Take me with you, won't you? We're partners in this, ain't we? Guard: All right, everybody, line up! We'll go back to the pen. Now. What's the idea of rattin' to the guards on me? Who says I've been rattin' on ya? I say so, you're a stool pigeon! And I say you're a liar! Come on, get out of the way! Come on, move! All right, break it up! Take this guy off me! I said break it up! Caxton: Yah! Hey, caxton, wait for me! ( Bang! ) Eddie, I don't mind telling you I'm worried. This rip caxton is the worst outlaw we've ever had in the west. When did he break out? Which break-out do you mean? He's been in the pen five times, and he's got away every time. I don't get any idea the guards were ever at fault. Caxton's clever as they come. Looks like we'll have to outsmart him. If you can. When was the last check you had on him? We got a report that he was operating somewhere around the town of silver spring. Silver spring... An old friend of mine is sheriff out there now, bill devry. That's right. Bill devry's the one I was going to ask you to see. He sent caxton up the last time. Knows all his tricks, and he should be able to help you. The way you've been talking, it looks like I'll need devry's help don't make any mistake about it... Caxton's mean, ornery, tough, a good shot, and he likes to kill. Got any pictures of him? Caxton has a complete disregard for the law. Even goes so far as to wear a polka-dot band on his hat so he'll be sure to get full credit for all his crimes. An eccentric sort of a fellow, I'd say. Polka-dot head band, eh? Shouldn't be too hard to round him up. Don't be too sure. Caxton can spot a law man ten miles away. You'll have to figure some way to draw him out. I'll figure something out. Good luck, Eddie. So long, marshal. Hope the next time I see you we'll have this caxton back where he belongs for good. What's cookin', Eddie? We got a tough one this time, soapy. Hey, where do you think you're going? See bill devry. Save your breath, Joe spindle. Ain't no lawyer gonna do him no good. He was framed and you know it. And when you've been sheriff a little longer, hutkins, you'll learn that you can't stop a lawyer from seeing his client. All right, go ahead. Hold his hand... 'Til sundown. How're things going, Joe? Not enough time. Well, at least my daughter will be home before... Before anything can happen. I don't know how she's going to stand up under this. I'll take care of tellin' Martha. Who would want to do this to me, Joe? And why? It's got me ripped. A man of forty years' service with the law. A man that's been sheriff, once a judge... A man like that isn't going to turn around and hold up a stagecoach and kill a guard. Everybody knows that. Joe, will you open that window over there? It's awfully stuffy in here. Sure, bill. You... Yeah... Take a good look, bill devry, it's me all right. I took a lot of trouble breakin' out and framin' you. But I swore I'd do it. How do you like being locked up behind bars? And how do you like this? ( Bang! ) ( Bang! ) Whoa! Martha, don't go in... Joe, what's wrong? I want to see dad. It's too late. What's happened, Joe? It was a dirty rotten frame-up. Your father was arrested for holding up a stagecoach and killing a shotgun messenger. And then he was shot down right in front of my eyes. Who did it? An escaped outlaw your father sent up a long time ago. He had a mask on, but there's one thing that makes me certain it was rip caxton. What was that? They say this rip caxton always wears a polka-dot band on his hat. So did the killer. Has anybody ever seen his face? Nobody around here. Then all we've got to do is find a man who wears a hat... With a polka-dot band. * my home is wild country * with rimrocks to the sky * in the solitude * I never feel alone * wild country * I'll ride it 'til I die * for there a man * can call his sole his own * the mountains meet the sunset * * until they meet the plains * rainbow-tinted valleys * green with summer rain * for they're in my country * it's mother nature's best * wild country * my home, the west * where life is well worth living * * and men are really men * where there's less take than givin' * * I'm headin' there again * for they're in my country * it's mother nature's best * wild country * my home, the west Soapy, we've been on the trail two whole days, and you haven't peeped about where we're heading' this trip. Well, Eddie, anytime I ask you, you always give me that look and say, "you'll find out." So I decided not to ask you anymore. You know bill devry? Heard of him, sheriff of silver spring. And one of the nicest old crook spotters I ever met. The u.S. Marshall says there's an escaped convict prowling his section of the country. That I reckon' without too much brain work is why they sent you up here. Ol' soapy Jones, he just goes along for the ride. Not this time, soap. Fact is, I don't expect a real fist fella without you swingin' your share of the loop. It's rip caxton. Rip caxton? Say, that's the man that wears the polka-dot hat band on his hat. So that's why you dressed me up like a fly-trap salesman in these fancy duds, huh? Oh, no, you don't put me out for any hunk of bait. All you gotta do is walk around town behavin' yourself. Caxton'll get curious, show his face and we nab him. That sounds fine spieling it off like that, but will it work? It oughta work without a hitch. It oughta work, but will it work? Or the hitch'll be a noose around my n-n-n- throat! Thought I told you to stay away from here. I was gettin' kinda lonesome hidin' out in that shack. I thought I'd like some company. People are beginning to talk about you being around town... You and that polka-dot hat band. You want to get picked up and have the whole story come out? Nobody's pickin' up rip caxton. Lock the door. Look, caxton, I'm doing all right in this town. And I'm not jeopardizing my control by having you doggin' me around. Sit down. All right. Why'd you kill bill devry in the first place... Instead of involving me in that stagecoach holdup and the murder frame? Because I wanted to do it my way. Make him sweat behind bars for a while, like he made me sweat. Well, he's finished off now. What more do you want? Bill devry's ranch. What are you going to do with his place? Fella could live in clover on that place. It'd be easy pickin's. Nobody'd know I was up to anything but tendin' cows... Maybe churnin' up a little butter. Look, caxton... I'm runnin' this town, and it isn't big enough for the both of US! Look, varney, you're wanted just as much as I am... Only you were smart enough to keep outta sight. Oh, yeah, and change your name. Now, if you don't want to play along with me until I get what I want... You win! What's up? I'm hangin' back. You ride into town and head for the main saloon. But, Eddie, alone? I'll be there in a little bit. Now quit lookin' like an old moss horn with a shake. We've got work to do. Work to do... And, remember, don't let on you know me! Look. That hat band, rip caxton. Rip caxton's comin' in. Look out, boys, rip caxton's comin' in. Watch your step, rip caxton's comin' in. Bartender! Give me a glass of sandwich and a ham of milk! Yes, sir! ( Gasps ) ( Bang! ) Do you see what I see? Yeah, I see it. What do you want to do, go out and yell fake? They think that chump cow hand is me! Get your sheriff and lock him up. What a break! Everybody'll think the law has rip caxton. All right, but -- never mind the talk! Put away that phoney. ( Gargling ) See the fella with the polka-dot hat band? Arrest him. I said arrest him! Hey, that's my gun -- hi, ya, sheriff, my name's -- I know who you are! My name's hutkins, sheriff of silver spring. Get up! Hutkins? What happened to bill devry? I said get up! Oh! Eddie! Oh, Eddie. Do you know this man? Sure, it's rip caxton. I've heard plenty about him. He seems to know who you are. It's me, soapy Jones, remember? They'll hang me! So what! You shoulda thought of that before. Take him away! But, Eddie, you don't understand. They'll break my neck! ( Chuckling ) Oh! Sam. Find out where he's headed. Beg your pardon, mister, but can you tell me if I'm on the right trail to cascade falls? Cascade falls? That ain't where you're headin' and you know it! Hand over your hardware. By the belt. Is this the devry ranch? That's right. I'm looking for miss Martha. This ain't no time for visitin'. Miss devry's father was killed this morning. Bill devry killed? Martha: Who is it, ace? Are you miss devry? Why, yes. I'm Eddie Dean. I was an old friend of your father's. I just heard the news. How'd it happen? He was framed... And then killed in cold blood! Do you know who did it? Well, we have an idea. Yeah, I think I have too. It's just possible this job I'm here to do and this business about your father might tie in. Would you mind tellin' me all you know? Not at all. Won't you sit down? Come on, now, confess. I know your record a mile back -- killin', arson, holdups... Even framin' bill devry. Me? And even killin' ol' bill devry right here in this cell! When the u.S. Marshall hears about me takin' rip caxton single-handed, it oughta be good for a nice reward. Yeah, it should. Say, you got any money on ya? Money? What good would money do me here? Where could I spend it? Well, I know a lawyer in town, smart one too. Thanks. But you have to send him his fee in advance. Yeah, I could use a good lawyer too. How much you think he'd be? How much you got? Oh, uh... I've been robbed! You're doin' the right thing, caxton. Thanks. This lawyer will be perfect for ya. You see, he's the undertaker too. Well, sooner or later, we're all going to need a good under- t-t-t- huh? ( Chuckling ) Sucker! Ah... Must have been horrible. What an awful way for him to die... Bill devry would make a mighty big fuss if he saw you actin' this way. * there's a saddle with a golden horn * * way up high * in the sky * just as sure as you were born * * there's a saddle with a golden horn * * there's a pinto who was my ol' pal * * way up high * in the sky * in the boss's big corral * there's a pinto who was my ol' pal * * settle down, you doggie * day is nearly through * and we have had a long, long ride * * there's a range for doggin' and for cowboys too * * beyond the great divide * rest my pinto in a martingale * * I'll be there 'round the morn' * * and I'll ride the glory trail * * in a saddle with a golden horn * * there's a range for doggin' and for cowboys too * * beyond the great divide * rest my pinto in a martingale * * I'll be there 'round the morn' * * and I'll ride the glory trail * * in a saddle with a golden horn * * way up high * in the sky * there's a saddle with a golden horn * you know, from what you've told me, I think I'll start by having a little talk with varney. For some reason, I don't like his looks. Keep your chin up. Find out what I told you to? He rode off to the devry place. Are you sure of that? Well, he was headed in that direction. What happened to you? My horse broke his leg mm-hmm, must be a pretty smart horse. He patched up his own leg and trotted back here. He's down at the gypsum place four miles the other side of town. Now suppose you walk down there and bring him back. Can I have a little talk with you? Sure. Sit down. How's business, Mr. Varney? Fine. Fine. Good whiskey, clean games. I'm showin' 'em how to run a business strictly on the level and still make money. Got any sideline? You mean like the hotel part of the saloon? I mean like avoiding a sheriff who takes his law from someplace besides the law books. I don't get you. Varney, you knew all along the man you locked up wasn't rip caxton. So somebody must've ordered you to do it. Who was it? Look, cow puncher, you can't come in here and -- I can if the u.S. Marshall sends me. You've got nothing on me. I run a strictly legitimate place! It looks like somebody else has. Maybe when I round up caxton, you'll have a little company on that long trip. How long have you been going under the name of "varney"? ( Bang! ) ( Smack! ) Maybe that'll teach him to keep his nose out of other people's business. What happened, Mr. Varney? Never mind! That cow hand you arrested and this hombre are both working for the Marshall. Tie 'em up good, Sam, and lock 'em in the office. ( Thump ) ( Thump ) I told you there'd be trouble! Now we've got the u.S. Marshall's men on our tail! Cool off, Barney. What's the matter with your sidekick? He ain't scared, is he? Take it easy. We're still in business. Only you're too jumpy to run it anymore. From here on out I'm callin' the plays. Sit down. Now, look... What happened to you? Run into a rattlesnake's nest. Serves you right for lettin' me down! It was a bad deal, soapy, but I couldn't let on I knew ya. Well, you didn't have to put on such a good act! You've got me believin' I am rip caxton. Listen, soapy, bill devry's been framed and killed. Yeah... I know. But what I want to know is... How do I get out of here? I'll get you out as soon as I find the sheriff. You better hurry up and find him quick! All right. Now, you wait right here 'til I locate him. Your darn right I'll wait right here until you locate him. Where else could I go! I tell you I don't want any part of a killing! All you have to do is like I said and leave the rest to me. Count me out! You've got an awful short memory, varney. You're forgettin' I know who you really are. So that's why I couldn't find either of 'em. That Marshall's man got away, boss. Thought I told you to tie him up good! I did. I'll bet you did! You know what to do but watch your step. That Marshall's man is on the loose. We better get out to that shack in cobra canyon right away. Well, you're a free man, Mr. Jones. Your partner straightened me out. You're to meet him at the shack in cobra canyon. Do you know where that is? That's mighty nice of ya, sheriff. Yeah, I know where cobra canyon is, but I don't remember any shack. It's down the first road after you get into the canyon. You can't miss it. By the way, your horse is out back. Thanks again, sheriff. Don't mention it. Oh, sheriff, I'm sorry for the way I stepped on your toe coming out of the saloon. Oh, that's all right. Here's your gun. Thanks. And as I was sayin', sheriff, I am sorry the way that I stepped on your toe coming out of the saloon. I didn't step on it hard enough! Oh! Oh! Something's happened in that jail, and I'm gonna find out what it is. ( Bang! ) ( Bang ) Five. Six. Where's your prisoner? I don't know. He got away. Don't give me that. Varney was just here. You two fixed up something. What was it? He found out he wasn't rip caxton. Said to let him go. Found out? He knew all along he wasn't rip caxton. Now start talkin' fast. Varney made a mistake, that's all I know, I swear! ( Smack! ) Now, what did you and varney fix up? I don't know. Don't ask me. I don't know! ( Smack! ) All right. Rip caxton's fixin' to get rid of the devry girl and frame your partner for it. Where's all this takin' place? At the devry ranch. Varney rode off the other way! In case you were watchin', he figured it'd throw you off. If you're lyin', hutkins... I swear I'm not lyin'. I told you everything. ( Door creaks ) It's him. ( Knocking ) Hi, gentlemen. Say, where's Eddie? He'll be around. Just relax. How can I relax. There's somethin' fishy goin' on here. See that the gent's made comfortable, Sam. Say, where's Eddie? What's this all about? Just a little surprise party put on especially for you. Miss devry. Oh, miss devry! That Marshall man, is on to US! Who told him? He beat it outta me! We're gettin' outta here. You're stayin' here. Rip caxton told US he's giving the orders now, and I'm seein' they're carried out! Where's miss devry? Me and the boys were on the way back from the north 40 when we saw miss Martha and four men ridin' off. Who were the men? Couldn't tell, but they sure looked like they were up to no good. We followed them for a piece, but we lost 'em. Come on! Well, here it is. It ain't like your place, miss, but, to me, it's been home. Looks like you need a little persuadin'. Well, go ahead. That's no toy pistol you've got strapped to your hips. Use it! You won't get a way with it, caxton. There's a Marshall's man in town. He knows who you are! Everybody knows who I am, miss. Only nobody around here's ever seen my face. When they do, they'll see a smart lookin' gent who moved into the devry ranch. You'll have to kill me before you can move into my ranch! Well, that was the original idea, ma'am. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. They must've taken a shortcut. Don't you understand? It won't work! The Marshall's man knows! You told him? But I didn't know -- save it! I'll take care of you later! You ain't backin' out now! Oh, no? Maybe my men will have something to say about that! Your men? Double-crossin' me, huh, varney? Did he tell ya who you were workin' for? Sure, he told me and the boys to ride for him and nobody else. He's a liar. I knew trustin' you was like pourin' good whiskey down a drain pipe. You dirty, double-crossin' -- ( bang! ) Don't tell me you couldn't help tellin' that Marshall man everything you knew! Let me go, caxton, I swear I'll get that Marshall's man I know where he went! You're stayin' right here! I've got some use for you later. Where's Eddie? Where'd ya see him last? Over at the jailhouse. Said he'd meet me here. At least that's what the sheriff told me. You oughta know better than to believe anything he told ya! Miss devry, come 'ere. Caxton: I said come 'ere! The shack! Yeah. And a good place to hide out in. Sam, put her on her horse and let her ride. I'll give her three to get goin' before I draw and fire. Listen, caxton, take this rope off me and let's go at it fair. Those are the men all right. ( Bang! ) ( Bang! ) Watch your fire. Miss devry's in there. Drop your hands and come out, caxton. Eddie: Come on out, caxton. We've got you covered. Don't shoot! I'm givin' up! You're finished, caxton. Come on out, or we're coming in! Stay close to this gun, or you're a dead woman! Start walkin'. Stay close. Make another move, and I'll kill the girl! Ugh! I thought you'd seen enough of that polka-dot head band, soapy, injun's wear scalps in their belt, don't they? Sure... And you had a hard time cuttin' this one down, didn't you? Ah, shucks. It was a cinch! I think it was a little more trouble than you both expected. Things didn't look too promising for a while, but when the u.S. Marshall gives US our orders, why, we try to do what we can. Eddie, why don't you and soapy stay on in silver spring? We'd like to, but we have work to do. Well, you can work here now that dad's gone. Hmm, settlin' down kinda frightens me, ma'am. Especially with a right, smart lookin' girl around the place. I should think some day you'd like to settle down. With a right, smart lookin' girl. Someday maybe, but right now... * ain't no gal got a brand on me * * no, sirree, I'm too smart * ain't no gal gonna get my heart * * yippee ki-yo * ain't no gal got a brand on me * * no, sirree, bet your life * ain't no gal gonna be my wife * * yippee ki-yea * with a pretty little gal * I love to Terry * but pretty little gals * all love to marry * ain't no gal gotta brand on me * * no, sirree, I should say * ain't no gal gonna get my pay * * yippee ki-yo, comma yippee ki-yea * * ain't no gal gotta brand on me * * no, sirree, this I know * ain't no gal gonna get my dough * * yippee ki-yea * yippee ki-yo * ain't no gal got a brand on me * * no, sirree, bet my horse * ain't no gal gonna be my boss * * yippee ki-yea * comma yippee ki-yo * with pretty little gals * I wanna woo so * but pretty little gals * all want a trousseau * ain't no gal got a brand on me * * no, sirree, wait and see * ain't no gal gonna hog-tie me * * yippee ki-yo, comma yippee ki-yea * * with pretty little gals I never mingle * * cause pretty little gals all know I'm single * * ain't no gal got a brand on me * * no, sirree, I should say * ain't no gal gonna get my pay * * yippee ki-yo, comma yippee ki-yea * * comma yippee ki-yo, comma yippee ki-yea * captioned by captioneering your closed captioning resource
