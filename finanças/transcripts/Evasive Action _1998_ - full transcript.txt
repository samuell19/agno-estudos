[music playing] [music playing] MAN: No! Will the defendant please rise. I am truly ashamed of what I have to do here today. Nevertheless, due to the recent developments, the accidental contamination of DNA and blood evidence, I am left with no alternative. Cases dismissed. Defendant is free to go. [gavel pounding] [music playing] [blowing kiss] [music playing] - Hey! - No! No, no, no! [gun firing] [screaming] [music playing] [music playing] [door slamming] [music playing] Mr. Sinclair, would you be seated please? Well, it looks like you've had an uneventful six months. Do you feel like you're fit enough to be released in society? Yes, sir, I do. Do you understand the seriousness of the crime that you committed? I know I killed a man. Do you feel that you've been rehabilitated? Well, sir, I never felt I needed rehabilitation. He didn't deserve to live. Look, Mr. Sinclair, I'm getting tired of going over this every six months. Now why don't you just sign this affidavit admitting that you were wrong, and that you're a changed man, and then your chances of parole will be increased dramatically. Sir, with all due respect, my integrity is the only thing I have left in this world. And I resent you trying to take that from me also. Very well. [music playing] Soup's on. Hey Kelly, come and get your tray. Well, I guess I'll take your cake then. [music playing] [muffled prisoners taunting] Yo, Luke, no go? No go. I'm sorry to hear that, man. I really thought you had it this time. Shit, if they ain't gonna let you out, I'm going to be here till I'm 200. Nah, you got to play the game. Just tell them what they want to hear, you'll be outta here in no time. Look, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but every time you come back, I can't help but to smile. You falling in love, Zim? I know a few boys in the yard will be very disappointed. Man, shut the hell up, please. Black man try to show his emotions and what does he get? Lip, and nothing more. If it makes you feel any better I'm glad you my neighbor instead of somebody like Hector. Oh yeah, that makes me feel a whole lot better. Hector. Jesus Christ. [laughter] Sit down, Hector. Sign this. And you get to go to brand new home. Isn't that nice? Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. [music playing] Sign it, Hector. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. I can't say I'm sorry to see you go. [inmates calling out] Hey man. - What's happening? - All right. OK. Give me some smokes, Charlie. INMATE: Hey Carpone. End of the lines back here. There are no cuts. Excuse me. You heard what I said. I don't give a damn who you are now outside. In here you're nothing what a crook. Put a ring on your pinky. Gets your ass at the end of the line. I'll tell you what, this is a democracy more or less. Let's put it to a vote. Any you gentlemen object to my cutting in front of the line? [group all saying no] See. That settles it. You know what democracy is don't you? They did teach you that at, uh, Harvard didn't they? [laughter] [inmates taunting] Thank you. [music playing] Look out! [crowd cheering] Peel that crook's head like an onion. No. [music playing] How many years you doing, kid? 14, 15, or something like that. How many have you done. 12. 12. What's the matter with you? You should have been outta here three years ago. You're not using your brains. I guess I'm not that smart. Sure you are. You're just cursed with too much character. I like that. What you have to do is learn how to combine character and brains. Terry give me a book of matches, will you? And tell the warden I want to talk to him. Thanks. You see? Life is all about compromises. But only smart guys like you and me know how to take advantage of that. I'll remember that the next time I need a pack of matches. Listen to what I'm telling you kid. You compromise your safety to protect me and I'm in debt to for that. And in here an Enzo Marcelli debt is no small thing. [music playing] Will the defendant please rise. I am truly ashamed of what I have to do today. I am left with no alternative. Nevertheless, due to the recent developments, the accidental contamination of DNA and blood evidence. Hey! [gun firing] I understand the rage in your heart, Sir, at the man accused of killing your wife and daughter but the law is there for a reason, and justice cannot prevail if we ignore it. For your act of bold, remorseless vengeance. I sentence you to 15 years in state prison. [music playing] Oh, here's a whole lot of trouble. WARDEN JACK KRAMER: C'mon in. Sit down. Thanks for seeing me. What can I do for you? It's about that transfer. What about it? I don't want it, seeing as how I've served of most of my sentence here. What makes you think your opinion counts? After 12 years you get used to a place, you know. The routine. How to keep your nose clean. Like yesterday? The word is Redwood is some sort of high tech facility, exclusively for murderers. Well the last time I checked, you still were a murder. Warden, there's a difference between me-- Look Sinclair, you're being transferred to Redwood. It's already been decided by-- well, let's just say a higher power. Besides, I've got a good feeling everything will work out OK. Just don't rock the boat and everything will be just fine. [music playing] [buzzer buzzing] [music playing] Come on. Alex, please let me help you with that. Please, Mommy. I'm perfectly capable. [grunting] So listen. Mom's going to meet you at the train station, and I want you to call me as soon as you get there. So let me give you some money in case you want some lunch or something, OK? There you go. $5.00, I don't see any golden arches. Here's five more. Thanks sis. You're welcome. Hey, would you like to help you with that, sweetie. Hey, watch the Italians. I have an IQ of 143 and a green belt in taekwondo. I think I'm perfectly capable of lugging this suitcase. Don't you? Hey, you got yourself little wisenheimer over here. She belong to you? She's my sister. Lucky you. Ha. Be nice, OK? Bye. Hello. Hi. Oh, I'm feeling in for Andy. Oh yeah? Yeah, yeah, I'm usually on the 1700 line. Joe Manetti. Well, it's nice to meet you, Zoe Clark. Would you stash my stuff for a second? Right back here? Yeah, my collection of toy trains. Got everything in. Got a passenger car, dining car, little red caboose. You know, choo-choo. [laughter] Thanks, I didn't know what you meant until you did the old choo-choo thing. - Want me to do it again? No, that's OK. Thanks. Uh huh. Choo-choo. Hey, Warden. Jack Kramer. Ralph Kantor. How are you, Ralph. All right, let's get this show on the road. Who's who? That's Tommy Zimmer, first degree murder. Killed his wife and the girl she was screwing around with. He's doing life. Luke Sinclair. His wife and daughter were killed. So what does he do? He pops the guy who did it right on the courthouse steps. Can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing. He's a pretty straight shooter. I doubt he'll give you any trouble. That's Hector, The Director, Miller, murdered 11 people about six years ago. Always reenacts a scene from a horror film. Mostly talks in movie quotes. Yeah, I heard some story about when this guy was in county waiting to get transferred. Yeah, pretended to have a heart attack. Yeah. When the nurse came, ole Hector-- I heard he bit her tongue off, right? Yeah. that's Ian Kelly, convicted arsonist an explosives expert. He fashioned a bomb out of a roll of tinfoil and drain cleaner. Killed 14 people at a rent-a-car agency. Said he wasn't satisfied with the service. Apparently not. Yeah, this one I know. Lorenzo Marcelli head of the biggest crime family on the West Coast. What's he serving? 300 years? He's only got 292 left. I tell you Jack, I'd feel a helluva lot better if we were flying. Well ever since that plane load of prisoners went down in Vegas, the FAA doesn't wanna have anything to do with us. Besides, that's the state of New York car. I doubt if the passengers will ever even know you're there. [music playing] You're in my seat. What? We're going to need a bigger boat. Get out of my seat. What? Are you some kind of moron? [music playing] Get him up. Been told you're not a troublemaker, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this one. As for the rest of ya, I don't want to hear a peep unless you're dying or your teeth are floating. Looks like teacher has a pet. Excuse me, do you think I can have something to drink? Well I'm not really supposed to be serving yet, but I think I'll make an exception in your case. A beer will be fine. Domestic or imported? Domestic please. Here you go. Root beer, my favorite kind. [laughter] - I'm Zoe. What's your name? Alex Kittner and I'm traveling all by myself. Wow, well where's your seat. I'll come by later, we can play some cards. I only play for money. Well me too. I paid for my entire college education playing Go Fish. Hey, sweetie, scotch and water. I'm sorry, sir. I can't start serving till the train starts moving. Kid's got a drink. She asked nicely. Gee, I'm sorry. Pretty please can I have a scotch rocks, miss train bartender lady. We're leaving soon, sir. I guess I'll wait. Can I see your ticket there, sir. It must be back at my seat. Can I give it to you later? Sure, how about yours, little lady. You ticket please. [low whistle] Pow. [train whistle blowing] [music playing] Thanks, doll. That man had a gun. A gun? Wow, what kind do you think it was? Maybe a laser gun? Or spear gun? Hmm, glue gun maybe? Zoe, I'm serious. Well maybe he's a policeman. I can check it out. Why don't you go back to your seat, and I'll see you in a little while, OK? Vitamin C. [music playing] [train horn blowing] Excuse me. Excuse me. I have to go to the bathroom. Already. Well we've been the train quite a while. It's, uh, jiggly, you know? Take him back. Hey, can I get a cup of coffee, extra hot? Yeah, sure. Joe, you remember that little girl that was here earlier. Yeah. She thinks she one of the passengers with a gun. Now it was that guy who didn't have his ticket. He's a cop. I was talking to him just a second ago. Hey, can I get my bag. Yeah, that's great. I just get worried, you know. Choo-choo. Please. Nice try. Well how do you suggest I use the toilet paper. Improvise. [music playing] Oh, excuse me, hot coffee. [music playing] [gasping] Got ya. Thought you were that greasy head with the gun. Well you must watch too many gangster movies. He's really a policeman. He didn't look like a policeman to me. Go Fish? Buck a hand. Marcelli, what are you doing there? Giving birth? I'll be right out. [music playing] Sir, this is a restricted area. Somebody told me to, uh, bring you a cup of coffee. It's, uh, hazelnut. I didn't order any coffee. Well, since you're buying. [gasping] [music playing] [suppressed gun firing] All right, Marcelli, let's go. All right, Enzo, pick up your panties because I'm coming in. [grunting] Get down. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. Open the gate. Smells like victory. [gasping] [guns firing] INMATE: Go, go. [guns firing] Attica. Attica. Attica. Attica. Attica. Attica. Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! [music playing] About time you got here. I wouldn't miss this party. The inner door's locked. Calm down. Get a key off one of these guards. And get rid of that gun. Fitz, you go over the top. Joe, work your way through the train. I don't believe it, it worked. No celebrating until we get off the goddamn train. Enzo. Thanks, but I'm OK. Hey, I went through a lot of trouble to get you on this train. You ain't spurning my friendship are you? Know, Enzo. It's just-- Good, because you're either with us or against us. See this guy? He was against us. Don't worry, kid, we won't hold it against you. What about dude? Go ahead, make my day. We'll leave him locked up. Time to get dressed. [music playing] Is there a phone of some sort or radio in here? I'm sorry, sir, you're not allowed behind the bar. Just answer the question. Right, there's a radio in the locomotive. OK, you're really gonna need to find a phone in case i don't make it. OK, see you're starting to scare me-- - Listen to me. - Just a little bit. There's six convicts from Santa Ana Prison back there. They just killed four of my deputies and now they're after me. I need you to call the police. You're kidding me, right? Just do it. Where are you going? I'm going to take control of this train before they do. [music playing] [door opening and closing] [music playing] In less than an hour we'll be off this train into a nice, little helicopter. By the time the train gets to San Diego and they start looking for us, we'll be long gone. It's absolutely important that they don't suspect anything. Capiche? All right, let's get rid of the bodies. [music playing] [phone ringing] DISPATCH OFFICER: Sheriff's office. Yes, hi, please, please listen to me. There, there are dangerous prisoners loose. Do you get that part? DISPATCH OFFICER: Please hold. Now please don't put me on hold. A hell of a thing killing a man. Take away all he's got and all he's ever going to have. C'mon. C'mon.

Wes, we've got emergency phone call from somewhere outside of Brownsville county. Something about a hostage situation? They're on line two. This is Sheriff Blaidek. - Oh good. Thank you. Please just listen to what I'm saying. My name is Zoe Clark. I'm a bartender on the West Rail San Diego train line. There are prisoners loose on board. Hold on, Zo, just slow down. OK, see, now that you're not listening to what I'm saying. My name is Zoe, not Zo. And I can't really slow down right now. Excuse me, lady. Jesus.

I got Warden Kramer, Lancaster State Penitentiary. He's on line three. Now, Zoe, I just want you to act normal, and then call me back in 15 minutes, OK? This is Blaidek. [music playing] Who the hell are you? - Look, it's all right. - You can't be in here. Get out. Look, I'm with the prison transport. The prisoners have escaped and they're armed. Now just drive the goddamn train. [music playing] Those men have been in my custody for years. I know them better than anybody else. All right Warden, I'm going to send someone to bring it down here. But before you go, fax us whatever you have. Photos, profiles, anything that might help. [sighing] God damn it. Notify the state police. And I want to move this to the mobile unit so we can follow that train. Now give me a direct line to Zoe and a direct line to the rail company. OFFICER: All right. OFFICER RALPH KANTOR: Where's your radio? All I got is just one way to the railway control center. They got a guy on watch 24 hours. That'll have to do. Hello, this is Officer Ralph Kantor, and we have an emergency. Hello, is anybody there? look, you sure this thing's working? I just use about an hour ago. You just got to keep on trying.

OK let's move it along. Let's step lively. Thanks very much, sir. Has Anthony reached the conductor yet? No, sir. He's been trying but nobody's answering. Well we'll just have to assume that they have control of the whole damn train. The only thing we got going for us right now is Zoe. That's a very nice blouse, ma'am. VINCE: All right, just move it on through. All right, sweetheart. Thank you very much. Watch your step going out there. OK, watch your step there now. You'll have to move to the rear now. Please, thank you. Please move to the rear. Sorry to inconvenience you. [interposing voices] Move to the rear please. Thank you. Hey, excuse me, uh, Marshal.

Marshal Jay Jacobs, pick up the intercom. Hey, Enzo. Look, I blew that door. It came right off. Unfortunately, so that part of the engineers head. The good news is the explosion killed that guard. ENZO MARCELLI: Idiot. You ever drive a train before? No. ENZO MARCELLI: Well for your sake i hope you're a fast learner. We got to try and stop this thing somewhere we can get to it. Zoe? Look we got another problem. All the prisoners, they've dressed like cops and they moved the passengers to the back of the train. SHERIFF WES BLAIDEK: Zoe, are you in a safe place? Well one of them saw me but-- hold on. [whistling] Oh God. OK, he's gone. Zoe, you have to try to stay out of sight now. It's important we stay in contact. [music playing] Got you, doll. Zoe? Are you all right? Zoe? Look. Hey, lookie. Look what I found hanging out behind the bar, chatting away with the police. I thought you told me you checked the bar. I did. Maybe she was hiding behind a god damned olives. Maybe. So doll, so how about a little R and R? Knock it off, will ya? Leave her alone. Who died and left you boss? [groaning] [music playing] God damn it. ENZO MARCELLI: Hey. - What? What the hell are you doing? I leave you alone for 10 minutes, you act like a couple of street punks. What's going on? VINCE: I caught the dame hiding behind the bar. She was talking to cops on a cell phone. That true? OK, miss, I'll give you an opportunity to redeem yourself. [music playing] [phone ringing] Zoe? Wes, it's Zo. We're worried after that line went dead. Yeah somebody was coming before. I didn't want to find me. Listen, I heard one of the men say they're going to be picked up by helicopter at the Donner Pass. Look, I got to go. I'll try to call you later. All right, and you be careful, Zo. Well done. I think you just saved your life. Hey we're cooking now. You want me to radio ahead and have a SWAT team waiting for them at Donner Pass? No, not yet. Take a look at that map. Say we have our boys set up an ambush at the Donner Pass. Right. If you were those convicts and you knew the cops are waiting for you at the Donner Pass, where'd be the best place to get off the train? There, right after Turner Junction. The only way to Donner Pass from there is by helicopter. So if we're at the Donner Pass, and they get off at Turner Junction, we'd be pretty much screwed, right? Yeah. All right. So you go ahead and radio our boys. You tell them to have the SWAT team set up an ambush at Donner Pass. Well where are we going? We're going to Turner Junction. I'm gonna hedge all my bets. We call the warden, and have him meet us there. Mobile one to dispatch. [music playing] [phone beeping] Yeah. ENZO MARCELLI: Yeah, it's me, Enzo. Listen, get a map. Got one. ENZO MARCELLI: OK, listen carefully. One mile from Target Junction, I want you to start slowing down, understand? Can you do that? I see it. I can do it. ENZO MARCELLI: Great. Hey, Wes, I talked to state. They're sending help, but right now it's just us. SHERIFF WES BLAIDEK: All right. Wes Blaidek, Matt Baker. [all greeting at once] A little bit short on bodies, so we're glad to have you here. Now that train may stop somewhere near here, so grab yourself a rifle. - Thanks for letting me join in. - Right. We're going the rest of the way on foot. MATT BAKER: All right. [music playing] [phone ringing] Tate. Anthony, this is Sheriff Bladiek at Turner Junction. I'm going to stay on the phone with you for a while. Now that train starts to slow down, Anthony, I want you to tell me immediately. Have a piece of paper and pencil standing by. What for? Because if the train starts to slow down, I want you to be able to estimate the location of where it's going to stop. OK. But I've got to tell you something. I got a D in algebra. Hello? [music playing] [inaudible] OK, everybody. Your attention please. I have some disappointing news. We're not United States marshals. We're escaped convicts. [gasping] Zoe. No, it's gonna be OK, sweetie. And we have complete control of this train. So everybody just, uh, what you're told and nobody gets hurt. OK. Now everybody up and to the back. Great. My travel agent's going to hear about this. [music playing] [cpu beeping] Marshal, they're slowing down at the rate of 10 miles every 20 seconds. Which means if we let x be the mileage, and we bring that over here. Then divide. No, multiply, multiply by half. SHERIFF WES BLAIDEK: Anthony. These little interruptions are not helping me. Yes. Yes! I got, I got, I got it! Are you going to tell me? Oh, yeah. If the train continues at this rate of deceleration, it should come to a complete halt approximately 100 yards past the intersection with Lyncroft Road, probably. - Probably Well definitely. Probably definitely. Lyncroft Road. Lyncroft Road. it's about a half mile south. All right, let's go. [music playing] C'mon. Everybody's doing just fine. Go on. Let's go. Let's go. Vince, grab that guy with the big mouth. Hey, why me? What about the broad? You ask too many stupid questions. Move. - Aw, c'mon. VINCE: Shut up. Let's go. Luke, you take these two. OK. C'mon. You're not going to let them hurt h us are you? Shut up, lady, unless you wanna end up dead. For your information we put a bomb on the front door of this car. [inaudible] [gasping] [music playing] Hey, right on time. Everybody out, c'mon. Move it. Could be any surprises. As soon as the chopper lands I'll let you all go. Let's go. If there's any problems, kill the kid. that way they'll know we're not screwing around. Enzo, it'll be my pleasure. [music playing] All units stand by until the suspects board that chopper. Now there isn't enough room for the hostages, so when they clear I want a single shooter to take out the pilot and force the chopper down. Over. [music playing] OK. That's far enough. We're going to release the hostages, except the woman. You're going to Mexico. But you said-- Shut up. Vince, grab her. - Come here mamacita. [gun firing] [yelling] [music playing] What're you doing? [guns firing] Throttle. [music playing] All right, now listen up I want you to put me on that train. You hear me? Put me on that train. Sinclair. [music playing] Aren't you gonna let me go? What'd I tell you about stupid questions? [gun firing] DEPUTY MATT BAKER: Wes said nobody shoots until he gives the orders. I had a clean shot. he was right in my sights. I had him clean. That clean shot just cost two cops their lives, not to mention an innocent hostage. How's that for your clean shot? [music playing] I can't control it. I've lost the hydraulics. You get it together and get me on that train! Now! [music playing] Now. Put me down on that train now. C'mon, put it down, now! Let's get it going! Get me close. [music playing] [loud banging] - Vince, see who's on the roof. - Got it. Zip, find Sinclair. Then what? Kill him. [helicopter exploding] I'll be right back. Where you going? I gotta make sure they didn't get back on this train. Don't leave us here alone. I'll be back in five minutes, OK? Promise? Promise. [music playing] [gun firing] You understand what I'm saying? But, Zoe, I just want to go home. Look, honey, I know you do. So do I. Are you scared? Yeah, a little. But I promise you, you're going to see your mom real soon, OK? [music playing] [gasping] Here's Johnny! Leave us alone. Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? You must be. I don't see anybody else here. Nice going. [music playing] Hold it, home team. Zim, listen to me. Look, I ain't going back to prison, man. You stay on the train and either the cop or Enzo is going to kill you. You stay with Enzo and you're a dead man. You help me, they might parole you. Come on, there's a little girl in there, man. Man, I thought I was going to Mexico. Come on, Zim. Hey. [inaudible] [gun firing] Hold it. You climb on up here. Slowly, I don't wanna have to shoot you too. I'm not one of them. Yeah right. C'mon. [music playing] Baker, this is Wes, do you copy? DEPUTY MATT BAKER: Copy. Matt, two convicts are down already. A third just jumped the train. I want you to notify the local police. Have them send out a search party for the jumper. I'm heading for the engine. [music playing] Zoe? Yeah. I'm Wes. Wes, I'm kissing you. I'm glad to see you too. You all right, honey? Yeah. All right, Matt. DEPUTY MATT BAKER: Go for Baker. Matt, I'm in control of the engine. The hostages are being held in the prison car. I don't think the convicts know I'm on this train, so what I'm gonna try to do is I'm going to try and separate that prison car from the rest of the train. Copy? Copy. All right, what we don't want to happen is for them to retake this engine, all right? So I'm gonna give you this. Now it's ready to fire. Now if that guy comes back, you just pointed it at him, and you pull the trigger. ZOE CLARK: OK. And you keep pulling until he stops. All right? Be right back now. Hang on. I'll be back in five minutes. [music playing] [dog barking] [radio chatter] [music playing] Zoe, didn't the prisoners plant a bomb? Yeah, but won't they be looking for us here? No, no. There are no scheduled stops from there to San Diego. [music playing] So look. [music playing] Can't see it. Look again. Fuck, where's Wes? Who the hell's Wes? [bomb exploding] Oh that's not good. Oh boy. Wes. Wes, do you read me? Of God, no. [music playing] So this must be Wes. how you doin', Wes? Well. Welcome back. Wes, this is Baker, do you read me? Wes, this is Matt. Do you read? Crap. Now what? Let's go grab our gear. Let's go, c'mon. [exclaiming at same time] [music playing] Damn it. [phone ringing] Tate. Anthony, I need you to reroute the train. What? Reroute the train? What are you talking about? What happened? Never mind what happened. We need to reroute the train to an isolated area. Can you do it? Um. Let me get back to you. Reroute train. Reroute train. [music playing] Well hello, sweetheart. Ain't you glad to see me? No, I ain't. Yeah, c'mere kid. [music playing] Yes! [phone ringing] - Anthony Baker, this train is headed for San Diego, right? DEPUTY MATT BAKER: Right OK, then I need to switch it twice. The first switch will put it on the line to Los Angeles. Los Angeles? Los Angeles, what are you crazy? Once it's on that line I can be reroute it to Barsfield. It's an abandoned station. All right, Anthony, you're the expert. If I'm the expert, we're screwed. [cpu beeping] OK, the train is now set to switch on to the tracks that head into Los Angeles. You got to switch it to the Barsfield Line as soon as you can. Duh. [music playing] Look what I found. Oh, thank God. One big happy family. You want to stay that way, do as you're told. Be patient. [music playing] [car exploding] [exclaiming] What the Hell? [cpu buzzing] [music playing] Oh crap! DEPUTY MATT BAKER: Baker here. Uh, bad news. Something just happened. The switching mechanism was disabled. - What does it mean? - What does that mean? On the whole good/bad spectrum, this is unusually bad. That was the last place to switch the train over. Crap. Ah damn. How much longer till it reaches the LA Line. The train will hit Los Angeles in approximately nine minutes. Nine minutes. Looks like I'll be working at the record store after all. [music playing] We'll be back in five minutes. Don't move or you'll be sorry. [music playing] C'mon, this way. What now? Now we put most of the hostages in the front few cars. Then we throttle this thing right into San Diego. About a mile before we hit the station we're going to uncouple the last few cars. We'll be in them. Every cop in the country will be looking for us, but we won't be there. [music playing] Mirror, mirror on the wall. [music playing] I knew you'd come back. Glad you did. Come on, let's go. I need your help. We need to separate this car from the engine. The only place to do that is between the first passenger car and the bar car. Alex-- Just don't tell me you'll be back in five minutes. I'll be back in a bit. Come on. Trust me, you'll all be safer here. Why don't I believe you? Just hurry. That train is going to make Swiss cheese out of that station in about five minutes. Yeah, right. Phone lines at out at Union Station. LAPD's on the way. I don't think they're going to make it. You better step on it. [music playing] Well I'm not going to be here when this thing hits. [music playing] Wait here. [grunting] Sinclair? Sinclair. Sinclair? [gun firing] What the hell are you doing here? I'm still on the clock. You know the kneecap is the most painful place in the human body to be shot. No problem. [music playing] Well you know I'm here. Not too smart, Sinclair. Without hostages you put us all on death row. Shoot me. I'm unarmed, you got a clear shot if you want it. Or you could let me help you stop this thing. It's our only chance. You think after all the trouble you've been causing me that I'm gonna let you live? You should've just let me stay behind like I wanted to. Would've been a whole lot easier on both of us. Shut up. You're not smart as I thought, Sinclair. Do me a favor. Kill this son of a bitch. Love to. [music playing] [gun firing] Kill him, Enzo. [music playing] Don't! [train crashing] [grunting] [radio chatter] C'mon, let's get outta here. [music playing] Holy cow. Check the train. I'll check the station. We need to get a unit to follow line. We're missin' half the train here. [music playing] Let me go, you're free. Shut up and keep moving. TRAIN ANNOUNCER: South 15 to the San Diego and Mexico will be leaving from tracks three and four in 15 minutes. [music playing] Freeze, Enzo. This has gone too far. When did you sprout morality? You said everything was going to be fine. You said no one was going to get hurt. No one was going to get killed. You said nothing would go wrong. TRAIN ANNOUNCER: All aboard track four to San Diego and Tijuana. You here that. We're going to be on that train, and you're going to look the other way. No, it's too late. Let the girl go! You're going to look the other way. Not this time. Let the girl go! You haven't got the guts. Maybe. And maybe not. You want her? You can have her. [gun firing] [music playing] [grunting] Man, you never learn. [grunting] Don't do it, man. Stop! LUKE SINCLAIR: Give me the gun! No! You'll be no better than him. [music playing] [train horn sounding] Police, freeze! [music playing] Mr. Sinclair, do feel remorse for the crime that you committed? The only remorse I have is not being able to be there to protect my family. You know for the past eight years, every six months you've given me that same answer knowing full well that when you said it your parole would be denied. Why? It's the truth. Well in light of what has happened recently and with recommendation of the governor, I'm going to give you that parole anyway. [music playing] And I hope you have some peace, Mr. Sinclair. [music playing] Thought I was gonna have to take a bus. [chuckling] It seemed like the least I can do. Besides, I need to ask you a question. Luke, you were off the train. Why'd you come back for us? I, uh, I let some people down once. I didn't want that to happen again. So where you gonna go? I don't know. But I'm not takin' the train. [laughter] Then hop in. [music playing] [music playing] [music playing] (SINGING) Been so long since I had you-- had you near me. All night long. Think about you. Wish you could hear me. I don't know where it went wrong. He shot. I shot. It was over before too long. Been three years since I've seen the light of your sweet face. Switching gears ain't been easy. My life's out of pace. I don't know who was to blame. These walls surround me, and I know I can't [inaudible].. No excuses. No excuses when you play with love. No excuses. Ain't no use in blaming you, my love. You did what you could. Did what you thought you should. [whistling] MCHENRY: Hey, [inaudible]. Oh, hey, McHenry. How's the hand? Eh, kind hurts. Any problems? - Piece of cake. Great. See you tomorrow.
