MORNING Warsaw speaking, Program One. It's six o'clock and we are broadcasting the morning review. Kielce was visited yesterday by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Edward Gierek. INDUSTRY-PROGRESS-SOCIALISM He toured several leading industrial facilities and met with workers, or in this case miners.

He hasn't prepared it yet. But what kind of work is it? Grip? There is no full set. No, it isn’t set. Lenda and Cyra haven't prepared it for him. They have cards, but they wander around and don't think about preparing it. -You took that much already. But now I'll stand and wait for work. You won't stand here, I'll just heap it on and come back! - How long then? - About one hour for him... - I'll be waiting... - What do you have? - This ones for radiators. - No, no radiators. Mr Kosumek! Communism sharpens your teeth, it will calm down finally and... But what's there to say... PUBLIC MEETING -Let's say it like it is. The rule is: you talk too much - they throw you out. And that's what happened. That's what happened! - Our deputy. - Manager. Sure it happened, he came to... - The Chairman come from the committee. - Mr Orłowski? Yes. He called me here and talked to me. I told him the truth, that we work hard, and we earn little. That we're on a shoestring, that we're soaking with sweat... for high quotas and low wages. They told us, sure. So I told them how things are: that we don't have the coupons we don't know the prices, we don't know how much we earn, we don't really know what we work for. And the next day after that they called me upstairs and gave me a transfer card. But why are you afraid to talk about these things? People are afraid because they're kicked out the door after that. I would’ve been out the door myself if my doctor hadn't saved me. -I'm telling you that's over. No one's kicked out for that. If the doctor hadn't given me the note that I can't be transferred... There are things that if you don't like it, the gate is wide open. And you have to go, don't you? That's why everyone is scared. Please, feel very free to... Please talk and behave the way you always do in any congress. How large the raise is going to be is a matter, isn't it? -Yes. - Well, within five years, no. - But how? When it comes to raises, how are you going to get the raise that you are talking about now. By the guidelines... in the guidelines for the Sixth Congress, it is assumed to be 17-18% through technical progress. By upgrading personnel grades. How? The machine can't put out more, it's already at 1500 watts! How could it, how could it do more? Accidents already happen. Unless we are going to do two shifts. Superiors... After working here so many years, A man is going to die with this group. I'll sit! -But gentlemen, with good machines. This is automated work for you. Yes, it is. But what will be the quota? How does he choose it? Well spoken! The quota will be the same, but the salary per personnel grade will be higher. It's not about the grade if a worker can only go up by group. After a few years can they apply for group VI? Group X let's say? But they're only on hourly pay when groups are entitled to higher day rates! But the reports… If the losses are still bad, it is our duty to fix and regulate them. But if it's bad, then well... I would like to raise one more issue. Our quotas are too high. Each little while he comes by and he raises our quotas. Now it turns out that I work a whole 8 hours for 36 zlotys. Tell me, how can one live with such a salary and how can one keep a house with that? We can hold a grudge against the manager, but he is just as innocent as we are. The actuary comes, each time he notices anything new. Boom - he gives us a new quota. He gives a high quota, we work hard, faster, and eventually there are rejects, because it's not quality that matters, but quantity! So we ruin materials, because we’re running it faster, faster, faster, faster... One group rushes another. It happens that a lot of money is made, but a good part of it is thrown down the drain. I'll explain everything, Mrs. Biegucka. What you are saying... What you are saying, is only partly true. Come on, every woman here will confirm! When you were speaking, I didn't interrupt you, Mrs. Biegucka. And no one has told you that you can't earn more. And please tell me if there are accidents like that when a worker earns 2500 or 3000 zlotys, someone cuts his pay. Please tell me. Were they? Are they? - There were those cases! - Well, when were they? Before the December Events. Well, that was then now is a new period, no? Sure, but one can't tell how things will be in it. No. So far it hasn’t been that way, and it doesn't look like it'll be that if he earns 3000 zlotys... - Cause if you earned 2000, 2800 or 3200, then he came and halved it. - Yes, you're right that that happened. There was chimney regulation, now chimneys don't exist. Unless you were punished for not working! It is just a matter of looking after our components. When they come right from transport, they look like this: Clean legs, elegant, no corrosion on them at all. We unload them here. They lie without any cover, without anything. Outside, it's raining, snowing, winter or not winter. Then those legs look like this: How much does is take to put them to work now? Twice as much. At least! But the price is, unfortunately, the same. No one can do a thing about it then. And this is not about much, it is not about any damn financial outlays. It's just about covering it with something, so it won't rain and snow on them. Then it won't be as rusty as it is now. And twice the work doesn't need to be done when the price is the same. And tons of acid goes on it. Acid is wasted, but labor is paid the same. How much in savings would that be! HANDS HEADS -Here is a finished device again. Molding could be brought to here.. - It's a bit heavy... - What? - Too heavy. - Sure it's heavy, but this... This one can be rolled up immediately. - Look, see... wait. It's stuck now. It's jammed, let's see. What happened here? I forgot the driver. -No, no. Not from this side. You can pull it away from there. Jesus! - It's coming. - Slowly. It got dirty here. A bit. Some scruff got inside. So now. It would lighten your load a lot, wouldn't it? Yeah, it's already running on those routes. Our route is quite overloaded here. You can't unscrew this screw. Unscrew the screw while it stays there. - So there we go... - We had pliers like these ones. And they wasted my day just knocking me out. Because there is no possibility, unless here it is: the pump may be damaged. It may not work. - The pump could be damaged. And now remove it. You may be able to improve this job yourself. Make it easier and faster. - Right away. Twelve minutes for the one piece. And... 10 pieces go to the engine. - 10 pieces. 10 pieces per engine, that is, we would have an hour, One, 10 pieces, 120 minutes or 2 hours. Yes. -2 hours would be down. For an engine. It pays off this way. DISTRICT INNOVATIVE LEATHER INDUSTRY PLANTS CULTURAL CENTER Already, Black? Already? Now there will be a song: In the mountains and valleys, You all know about this, That our factory, Is already famous And we enlist! - You give up today. - To sit down a bit. - So, start, now! In the mountains and valleys, Ey, in the mountains and valleys You all know about this WE WELCOME THE VI PZPR CONGRESS Ey, that our factory is already famous. Ey, that our factory is already famous Though we make shoes, we walk in moccasins, Tatras Mountains above all, Our hearts are with highlanders. Ey, though we make shoes We walk in moccasins… FACTORY COMMITTEE -Zenek, Zenek! I have a letter for him, in the red briefcase. A letter concerning that case? That guard, who... And he asked the chairman not to... - Well, okay. - But I would like to have it... In such a case I must have it in black and white. Otherwise people would get on me. They would say that we give things out to strangers... If... -but us workers of the Jastrzębie Mine can't get anything? The chairman said if you need a note there, it could be added. -Please add it then. Come in, come in! So, I was about to say something... It's a letter left by Wojciechowicz who received a plot of land on District 3. And he was told, that... No mine is only open to 16:00, they are open everyday until 17:00, and then all the shops are closed. It's a very, very countryside town. That's it! The delicatessen is open... He was mangled on the rails, and that's all. - A train. - He was run over by the train? So when is the funeral supposed to be? - Madam, please don't... - We don't know, perhaps on Thursday. They told us in the hospital, that if he didn't... - Which hospital is he in? - In Włodzisław. - In Włodzisław... - Well, but she wants to take him home. - Of course, she has a place to live. - But there is already... - And what was his name? - Bartosz Hubert. -525-526 -That's on GPT, right? If he was an employee, then he's entitled to an orchestra. He was from the GPC department, wasn't he? - Yes. Well, if only I knew, I'll have to find out exactly when the funeral will take place. Then we will prepare an orchestra, OK, well. This is necessary... - Please let me know tomorrow. - Yes. OK. OK, you don't need this personally, you already have more troubles, and then this. Let someone from the family, or someone close let me know here. That is: when and what hour. Only where and what time it will all start. ...it's navy-blue and on top it says “Miners' Trade Union". - Miners. - Yes, perhaps not miners, but... How long have you been having these problems? So speaking precisely, it started even back in April. Do you work here, citizen? Just 6 weeks... Listen mister, there is a thing they are accusing you of, that you are somehow not doing right at work. That you don't want to work, sir, that you are slow, and so on. Well, the case is that I'm working in a mine for the first time. I had my very first descent March 4th, in Mine C. OK. And those scenes started right at the beginning of April. So it was just after I finished the training period. 25 days after that... And next you... you went, after training, you went straight off down. Which branch are you working in now? - I had my training in G15. OK. - And I came to G12 right from the first, didn't I? Yes. - Right after finishing the training. And the case was that I would take a month to practice, right? No experience, besides, people with permissions were lacking a lot on the belt conveyors, or for pacer, or for shearer. I didn't know that stuff. You should always find a common language, somehow. I believe that it is a duty of the factory council to protect workers. And the factory council should settle any troubles in the worker's name. And not the director, everything should be handled by the management. Administration-management will have everything on hand. And that's why the factory council is really powerless on some things. Why? Because the factory council is financially involved with the director. But what about the last workers' council chairman? I say they should have influence. He's remembered because he's no longer with us. He hanged himself after a few months. He wanted to put his foot down. So they told him: "Beware guy, or we'll put your nose out of joint". They did. - Or not exactly that way... -And where was the collective? Where was the collective then? Where were activists, where was the collective? The same fate may be awaiting anyone. Well, what's the general conclusion here? Do we have nothing to say? That we're only here to work, to make promises and nothing more? Then it'll keep being bad until the workers directly have active influence on the management of the plant. On setting the plan, on stating objective possibilities for the execution of that plan. And until those plans flow from below. OUR AMBITION - LEADING RANK. FACTORY CONFERENCE -Party organizations in consultation with delegates suggest for the candidates list the following comrades: First: The First Secretary of our party's Factory Committee, Executive Committee member, Comrade Bogdan Sęk. Second: Comrade Wyrozemski Aleksander. Ship-fitter from the Naval Engines Factory. Comrade Dzieliński Stanisław from Locomotives and Coaches Factory. Do comrades have any remarks or other suggestions? As far as Comrade Zieliński's candidacy is concerned, we... have also proposed it at the conference with our delegates. And this candidacy was adopted unanimously, recognizing Zieliński's merits in both work on the job and in community service. He is deservedly authorized to represent our factory as the delegate to the Sixth Congress. So can I take it that according to your consultation, the proposal is certain? - Yes. - Thank you kindly. Others comments? This is not only my opinion, but in consultation with the secretaries, that all the organizations see Cegielski as a delegate for our party's Sixth Congress. With reference to all three candidates, there are no objections, I believe. All comrades in the commission are unanimous. Thank you very much. Jan Baran, service departments' inspection. Among other things, at a meeting with delegates from our service departments, we have, among other things, discussed the candidates, which could be selected today to take to the Sixth Congress of our party. Concerning the candidacy of the first secretary of our factory committee, Comrade Szajny. It was by all means supported because of his experience as comrades have said here, which has characterized him since his youth. And we as the service department believe he definitely deserves to be the delegate for the Sixth Congress. Regardless, there should be four comrades on the ticket. So, according to the Central Committee election instruction, the room must complete the list with another, let's call it, delegate. Are there any remarks or suggestions on this matter? Please. I don't see any. Is there a need to vote on this? By all means, comrades! I think that the committee's position on this is rather unanimous. So, for the formality, let go on. Who is for it? Thank you kindly. In that case I see that the proposition was accepted unanimously. Therefore we end today's meeting of the committee with that highlight. Thank you very much. It's not allowed to smoke in the meeting room, so we may smoke a cigarette now. We have a lot of time because the paper will last somewhere around an hour. - I was observing the life of fish. - And what have you noticed? I wanted to know if fish speak. And what do they say? They don’t, because they have water in their mouths [polish idiom for keeping silent]. Thank you very much. - Goodbye. What is it? - Who doesn't have a card yet? - I don't have it yet. Wait a minute. I gave out 150, so you already have these cards. The first and the second table would be so kind to cast votes in turns, by row, here, into the first ballet box from the right. And the third and fourth table will cast their votes here, into this ballet box on the left. So in turns please: first row and in. Come on. It was going so well. - Did you write ZMP? [Union of Polish Youth] - Yes, I did. After '48... Which party. I don't know if they monitor which party you were in. Especially in organizations, so write down ZMP, or... ZMP, isn't it? - ZMP. -Well, ZMP then. Since when? - Since '48. - Here, here you put it. - Well, good. - Here put down Giermaszeń. - Give this here. - Is that it? One, two... I will count to 20 and ration them out. Four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten. A day before yesterday one of the party foremen comes to me. He says: What? Did they make a commitment? And then he says: It looks like it, But I remind you they haven't fulfilled that commitment. But still they tried. They went to the construction company, to the manager. And manager lent them four oxygen tanks. So they would make him... But what’s that? A drop in the ocean. 76, 78, 85, 105, 112, 122, 126 126 by 3 We should be in the Tatras Mountains for this? That one already dropped out, Wiśniewski, he's in second, those two are third. Everything is correct. He'll get it soon. I'm finishing. -Isn't this a draft? - I have to rewrite it. - Can I have a card? - A card? Of course. A card. -And can you report it by the way? No problem. WJ3 - But I have to write to him. - Don't you have it counted? No. I have it counted, but you know. So I'm finishing. I am doing the end. - Well. - One moment. The matter is that... Are the seventh ready? It is important. In such a team, come on, Comrade Pumaczowa. Pawełek Waser also thanks you. Returning committee's report. Results of delegates election oo the Sixth Congress of the PZPR. Filipiak Włodzimierz received 40 votes. Sajna Bogdan - 140 votes. Wyrozemski Aleksander -118. Zieliński Stanisław - 132. The returning committee states that as delegates for the Sixth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party were elected: Comrades Sajna Bogdan, Wyrozemski Aleksander, and Zieliński Stanisław. Arise, ye workers from your slumber, Arise, ye prisoners of want. For reason in revolt now thunders, at last ends the age of cant! CONVERSATION It should be fortified in the constitution brother, or if you please in anything else, that no one has the right to order the shooting of a worker or to shoot. After all, if you please, it's a country of workers and peasants. By what right, please understand, it could happened, that someone decides to order people shot! I think... -By what right, gentlemen, by what right? But not everything from here reaches us up there. Well, that's it, that's the matter! -Yes! Go back in your mind, if you please, remember back. There was always, if you please, the sine wave. It was going up, shares were going up, and then, if you please, they were systematically and suddenly falling. You are 56 years old. People who already hardened to their ways... -Wait, just a minute. But it was endlessly believed that it would be our country. But it is also, it is also spread over time somehow. Spread over time. To rise. And slowly, slowly, slowly fall. It's such a serious system, nothing should happen, if that party would respect its laws. If she would maintain some contact with the working class. But when the worker's not allowed to open his mouth, right, it will never get better. That's the point. The worker will also have to voice his opinion. What does he want, and how does he want it. Concerning the work, I'm sure that all of us will go all out, right, to work the best, most efficient way possible. But I think we will also do everything so they won't cheat us, so they won't cheat us, spit on us, like before. And so there would be some payments for that, for the work. Lest December happens again next year. -After all it's just logical. You can't make bricks without straw. We were exhausted for so long, and we still are. We'll feel that pain let's say, another year, another two years. But if the improvement is systematic and if it grows, then you will tighten your belt, do your work, and everything will be fine. All you have to do is make it happen, to see the real desires, to look after it to make it better and to proceed in making it better. I believe that we should stand by this conclusion. Surely there will be people who will start to stroke or spread the honeycomb again, polish the ice-cream, and so on. -Indeed! As for social-pedagogical matters, they still haven't registered us yet, over and over again, haven't they? Yes! That's it. They laughed at a whole bunch of serious matters in management, right, in politics, and so on. - They are covering our eyes! - Other's cases, side issues, right. Work and pay is most important for me. Social and living conditions, are very important, right, But no less is: how will we manage. What will we do, right? Who will do it? - Is it good? - Is it good, or bad, right? Those people, who will take the positions, right, they should feel like stewards. But if they don't, if they lack that responsibility - remove them. And if everyone will think that he won't be punished for that, we will know, that many of those who... - For the honest ones that's really... - When I look at all of this... Honest ones also have to account, so they don't get tangled just by chance. -No, they won't. Perhaps, maybe not. But we all know perfectly well how Edward Gierek started. He hardly had any supporters. The only support he gained was from the working class - from us. - Of course it's in us! - Yeah. But there is one, there is one thing. He ought to keep, to lead that course, an open and honest one. Still honest with the worker. So it wouldn't be a secret. So it would stop being a secret already, at all times, about all actions undertaken. Because, please understand you won't go in. We want to participate normally in the political life, and in social life. There used to be a saying: Nothing about us without us, nothing about us without us, right? Here we are a country of workers and peasants. That's one thing, on the other hand: I don't think, that it must be a rule, that the factory director, department manager, or anyone else, has to be a party member. No, of course, it can't be. - Not necessary. - That's not the point, right. - A qualified man. - He’s nominated and meets qualifications. - They can't put it that way. - No, after all now it’s a conversation. Gierek said it himself. - They can't put it that way, that... he has to be a party member. - That everyone must be practically. That one may have lower qualifications, etc. But he has to be a party member. - Why? - These differences should be erased. Give them the opportunity, talented people, active ones, right. Those who know how to work, want to and can work. Moreover, they were instilled even recently, after those December Events, that in the end we are just the ruling class. So let's say, that we are the hosts of the land, not anybody else. Will this be our province, or our country? - I think I feel that. We must, let's finally feel that way at last. Begin to feel it and want something concrete to do, and to demand that as well. People have learned one thing: That, apart from looking at your own plate, one also looks further past that now. - For sure, for sure, that's... - Simply, if you please, ...that is finally going to change. To be able to use it in the right way, right? And not let people down. Because if they are let down once, a second, a third time, then in the end it can't be counted on, that promises will be made, and it can't be done. THE INTERNATIONALE -Comrades, please, the Election commission has determined the candidate for the Congress. It was decided to present at the conference, Comrade Bartoszewicz. Comrade Ryszard Bartoszewicz works in department U1 - the wood department. He is a carpenter. Rich for poor. -Gentlemen, if you please, -I suggest Comrade Dopierała. Comrade Dopierała, while at the forefront of the union's authority for several years, he kept position of the First Secretary the whole time. But it is our wish, and I think your applause shows it comrades, that Comrade Dopierała should represent us as a delegate for Sixth Congress of our party. At the same time I propose, that Comrade Dopierała, in the same way, is sent as a delegate for the district conference of the Polish United Workers' Party. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please, if any comrades have remarks, to the proposition proposed here by Comrade Pawlak? I want to highlight here that comrades proposing the next candidates should also specify, in whose place they go as. Please, go on. Does Comrade Dopierała agree to run, because that is important? Please answer. Comrades, this is how I feel: There will be Sixth Party's Congress. The Party's Congress has to take a stand in relation to policy pursued and give it a new direction. But it is my feeling, however, that in the Congress the factory should be represented by a comrade who directly stands on the front line. Directly in contact with production. My feeling is that the secretary of the organization these days should nevertheless be on the party organization. Because there will be after all an intensification of political work, the anniversary of the December Events is approaching, and as a political manager here in shipyard, I would rather see myself here, in the factory. In these exact days. Therefore, I would like to ask you to remove my name from the list of candidates. You are supposed to do it according to statutes requirement. The proposition was given, since only two are needed, therefore, we now proceed with the first, proposed by the Electoral Committee. To Comrade Bartosiewicz, that he should state whether he wants to attend the Congress and represent the shipyards. To the candidate. Comrades, my candidacy was discussed at the factory committee's plenum session. When I first heard this proposal... I should say that it was unexpected. In the plenary session and at the meeting with the secretaries... It simply seemed to me at a glance, that, well... I didn't know if I could manage such a thing. However, in the plenum, when they talked to me, most comrades, they said, that nevertheless they see me as a candidate, that I am able to after all. I believe I won't disappoint this confidence, and I will try, if possible to fulfill the needs we have in this moment. Well, I have one more proposal. As we, according to statute and also with the new instructions, I would like an equal partner. And if I am a worker, I feel that in any case, that the First Secretary has a certain superiority over me. Therefore, in that case, I withdraw... withdraw my candidacy. As something informal. It's not for me. Comrade Michalak, please! Please keep calm! Please... I'm asking for a vote. -Comrade Michalak, please. Excuse me. I ask for a vote, comrades. Towards the candidate's statement, which he stated here, it is “not serious” comrades, how do you put it? As an “equal party member”, what, is the secretary not equal to you? An equal party member! Surely the same as you are! And if he is the First Secretary, then how do you put it?! That he has some superiority over you?! You can't put it that way! "I withdraw". “It's not serious!” Thank you very much. Colleague. Comrades will of course express their opinion by voting. I propose we put to a vote the first candidate, Comrade Bartosiewicz, proposed by the Electoral Commission. Who of you, comrades, is for putting him onto the election list? Go on. We vote by mandate. Thank you very much. Who abstained? - And who is against? - 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! -With nine abstained. And who else is against? With one against. The candidacy of Comrade Bartosiewicz is put on electoral list by majority of votes. The next candidacy of comrade... Comrade Linowski. A point of order. I think, dear comrades, that we are making mistakes here. Although they may be not so important, it seems to me that the many comrades who don't know Comrade Bartosiewicz would have questions for him. But if we put him on list, we agree to everything, Then it is enough for us to vote. I, for example, don't know Comrade Bartosiewicz from the point of his social work. I don't know how long he's worked in the shipyard. There was a question, how many years has he worked in the shipyard, because it needs to be asked. So eventually I may know on whom I'll be voting. So perhaps I would like to... I would like to answer some of the questions. So please, ask me them. I am here, in the presidium, after all. Regarding the shipyard: I've worked here since 1960, since 28 October. In eight days I am finishing 11 years of work in the shipyard. Thank you, Comrade Badowski. I have a specific question to put to the candidates. So they should answer yes, or no. Do they want to represent us, or not? Specifically! Yes or no! Don't swim around it or say nothing. Tell us either yes or no. First one candidate and then the second one.. So Comrade Dopierała answers, if he agrees or not. I ask to be crossed out from the list. Comrades, who on that issue please? Comrade Pawlak. -Comrades. It can't be put that way: yes or no. Comrades, if we choose a comrade, it is an honor to be a delegate for the Sixth Congress. It is maybe the most highly active reward which a party member could ever get, to be a representative in such forum that will take place at the Congress. And such attitude, it is rather out of place. And I believe, that he should be put on the list! - Comrade Linowski, please. - Comrade Dopierała, as an old activist, we know each other after all, right? I would say that it was out of place, your statement. So, if Comrade Łazowski has expressed himself badly and let's say capriciously, then let's say, that Comrade Łazowski is not mature enough, expressing himself way that... If let's say we give a mandate to Comrade Dopierała, then I don't think we would discuss it. And Dopierała insisted they couldn't tell us that because since Łazowski expressing himself badly, I resign from mandate. That's not true, Comrade Dopierała! It must be said that what you said at the beginning, comrades here said that if you are not here, then we'll roll our sleeves up and defend what you have gained! Do you understand? And I don't think there should be any excuses here. Let's say it this way: I don't want to be ashamed, let's say. You Comrade Dopierała, as I remember you, you came from production. You worked on production. You were secretary and I believe you should continue to be. So I support the candidacy of Comrade Dopierała for, let's say, delegate for the Congress of our party. - So perhaps right away. - Bring the comrades to Warsaw. The Comrade is for representing us accordingly each day. - Comrade Dopierała, yes, or no? - Yes. I am supporting myself. It is put correctly. Political and organizational motions. Sanction the existence of a workers' self-government organization, workers in the draft of the new constitution. I hope we will discuss it. Our statute must be worked out at the Sixth Congress. It must apply to everyone, from top to bottom and vice versa. It can't be as it was before. Introduce a rule of accounting party members, in front of party organization they belong to regardless of the sanctions applied by a superior unit, in which the person concerned works. It should be clearly committed and consistently required from the provincial authorities to initiate a renewal on every lower level. In our opinion, the renewal of economic and political life is too slow. Most discussants scrutinized the methods and forms of party training. That it is outdated, dull, that it is simply not the need of our times. We are of the opinion that the working week should be shortened, which would ensure better regeneration of workers' strength. Of course it must go hand in hand with the expansion of recreational and cultural facilities.
