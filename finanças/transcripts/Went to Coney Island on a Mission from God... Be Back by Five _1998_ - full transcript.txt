Is this on? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We hear you, Sinatra. You wanna get this going? - Oh, okay. Okay, sorry. - Thank you. My dad once told me that he thought that somehow during the night... can openers turned into wire hangers. Sort of like caterpillars turned into butterflies. When I asked him why, he said, "Whenever I look for the can opener... I can't find it, but when I open the closet, I see 37 hangers that I never saw." So when I told him that I'd be very surprised... if the biggest news in physics was happening in our kitchen drawer... he said, "It's when you don't expect it... just minding your own business, that the biggest stuff happens." And what's weird is you don't even notice it. Like when I met Stan, I think we were 5. Nothing amazing happened, but everything changed. We grew up on the streets of New York City. Literally. Back then, the streets gave you two choices: You could be tough, smart, Streetwise, cool. Or you could be me. I think the first thing I noticed about Stan was that Herman Munster shoe of his. Scared the crap out of me. I wonder, if I knew what I was in for with this guy... would I have looked the other way? Probably not. It wasn't until seven years later that Stan and I met Richie. You wouldn't know it by looking at him, but this kid was a legend with the ladies. Word was he'd already had sex with two of his sitters. He gave me the best advice on women that I've ever heard. Always compliment her footwear. Ah. Whoa! STAN: That's cool. How'd you do that? It's easy, you know. Nothing much. And then Stan met Gabrielle. Who's that? Who? That girl. Rochelle? - No, the one with... - Jennifer? - No, the one with... - Oh, she's new. Man. No, wait. What's your name? I'm Stan. I'm sorry. Please stop crying. Please? Um... Hey, nice shoes. Really? Well, yeah. Thanks. I always looked up to Stan. He could get away with anything. Because of his leg... he could walk the halls without a pass, cut class and I'd follow right along. Come on, we gotta go. I'm working now. Why? We had a code for when he wanted to play hooky. All we had to say was: We're on a mission from God. Oh. Okay. Daniel, Stanley, where are you going? Daniel has a... a family emergency. Oh, really? - Yeah, his grandmother died. - She did? - Stanley. - Oh, my God. She's dead? How can you say it that way? He's very sensitive. Oh. Sorry, man. Come on. Calm down, will you? She's fine. I was just getting you out of there. Usually we cut class to look at this 1964 issue of Swank... that Rob Magnoli stole from his dad, but this was different. - Okay, we'll start here. - What? - Ready? On your mark... - Huh? On your mark. Get set. Come on, get set. Go. Yeah! You always win. - Even with your leg... - They're gonna do it to me. No way. I thought your parents didn't have the money. The doctor's gonna do it for nothing. - He thinks it'll make him famous. - Wow. So how's it gonna work? He's gonna take some bones out of my hip and make my leg longer. That way when I grow up, I won't be a hunchback. - Then that's great. - Yeah. But I won't be able to... The joints will be too fragile. I can't run. I won't be able to run. I won't be able to do anything. I'm gonna be a... I gotta wear a brace. A big metal... For years. Maybe forever. I'm gonna be a gimp. Gabby's not gonna wanna... My doctor's gonna be famous and I'm gonna be a freak. You're not gonna be a freak. You'll be... the Bionic Man. I didn't know it then, but it would be the last time we'd ever race. The operation didn't go well. Where is Stan? He's always so late. - But he is so cute. - Yeah. - So, what about Flock of Seagulls? - Who? - Hey! - Where were you? - Sorry. - I had to take care of something. - Yeah, sure. Here. And I'm sure you all remember the band. The whole thing was Richie's idea. He thought it would be a great way to meet girls. Eleventh grade. We sucked but the girls dug it. I think it was the leather pants. Or maybe it was Richie's Loverboy headband. Stan and Gabby were on and off all through high school. And then she went to City College, and Stan and I got jobs. Well, Stan got a lot of jobs. He sort of had his own idea of what work was. We kind of lost track of Richie after graduation. And since we weren't looking at the clock on the wall of homeroom... the years just flew by. Stan ended up at his cousin Anthony's pizza joint, which wasn't so bad. Stan always said, "if I got free beer, then it's a good gig." - Hey! - Hey! Slice with onions. - What happened to your face? - What? Oh. I got drunk. Fell down. - Stay or go? - Go. Two bucks. See you later. So there he was, just minding his own business. Hey. Hey, Jojo, what's up? - Yo, man, I have got news for your ass. - What? In my job, I got the glamour. Six hundred dollars a week before taxes... a pain-in-the-ass boss and exposure to toxic chemicals. Very old. It's been in the family for generations. They're made in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Liu. How many generations you had them? - It's good silver. - Uh-huh. Yeah, they're plate. There's not much I can do for you. - Okay, I can go $18. - What? So valuable, so old. Yeah, we go by weight here, Mrs. Liu. You know that. There's a pawn shop down the street if you wanna try them. Can you do just a little bit more? Shh. Don't tell Sol. - Huh? - Nothing. Sign here. I lose a lot of pens. Thank you. - Come on. - What do you mean "come on"? I mean move your ass. - Where? Why? - We're going to Coney Island. Stan, I am working, okay? I got a job here. - It's winter. Why? - We're on a mission from God. Oh. Okay. Sol. Sol, hey. - What, already? - You gotta let me take Daniel. We gotta go now. It's a family emergency. - Oh, really? - Yeah, his grandmother died. - She did? - Stan. Jeez, would you take it easy? Oh, my God. She's dead? Call me later. What? Yep. Homeless. Nuts. - Richie. - Yes. - Munoz? - Our Richie, yes. No way. Homeless? Jojo heard it from his cousin's girlfriend. Wait, which cousin? The lesbian one? - How does she even know him? - Hey, Jojo said. - That's crazy. - Hey, crazy shit happens all the time. Sha Na Na played Woodstock, for chrissakes. "Jojo said." For this you pull me out of work. I wouldn't leave if it wasn't important. You'd leave if Cleopatra Jones was playing. - Hey, Cleopatra Jones is a great movie. - My point is Jojo who, in the fifth grade... put a pipe cleaner so far up his nose... that Mr. Crydniarski had to pull it outwith pliers... He was stuffed up. It was a sinus thing. My point is Jojo is not a reliable person. Don't pull me out of work... because Jojo and his lesbian cousin say so, okay? You know, I wanna keep this job. - How do you know she even knew Richie? - Jojo said she described him exactly. She talked to him, he remembered the old building. He looked the same except she thought he hadn't showered or shaved in a year. And he was picking up garbage, crap, all over the place. Jeez. Really? Consuela's been on my ass to buckle down. I can't be leaving... - Whipped. - Bun-monkey. - Dickweed. - What? Because I care what she thinks? Don't you care about Richie? Yeah, but Coney Island? Why Coney Island? I don't know. Huh. Nuts, she said? Like a little strange or, you know: Like I said, I don't know. That's why we're going. We're gonna find him. See, neither of us had seen Richie in 10 years since the thing with his sister. But when we were kids, we'd been so close. - Do it. Come on. - I don't know. Come on. Hey. Hey. You shorted me a box of Pixie Stix. Casual. Casual. Hey! Hey! Stop those kids. You little... Hand over. What? - Gonna call the cops. - Call them. We didn't do nothing. - Please? - Touch us and we'll sue. My father's a lawyer... Holy shit. Richie? You okay? - What's with him? - I don't know. What'd you do to him, you fat bastard? Look, you kids stay the hell out of my store. Never come back or else I swear... Wow. He's gone. You can stop now. You're a genius. - So that was good, huh? - Great. Fooled me, that's for sure. Cool. Let's go. Well, we'll give it a couple of hours, but... No, thanks. So. - Consuela looked good. - Yeah. Yeah. - She usually does. - Yeah. You know, you should marry that girl. How many beers is that? I'm not drunk. I'm just saying. You been going out eight months. You gotta make a commitment, you know? - I see, I see. - What? - Gabby's been giving you shit again, right? - No, no. - I'm worried about you. - Gabby wants to get married. She's 28 years old, she wants to get married. Why don't you have this shit with Consuela? Consuela and I... You know, it's different. You guys been going out for a hundred years. - Nothing left but to make it legal. - You sound like her. - Well, it's not unreasonable. - Well, not when you say it. Some reason, when she says it... - sounds like Charlie Brown's parents. - Wah, wah, wah. Wah, wah, wah. Yeah. Whoosh. - And then she gets mad. - Gabby doesn't get mad. She did the other night. Check it out. I got home. I'd had a few. Big deal. Ugh! Hey, baby. Oops. Shit. I'm so late. Where's my locket? Oh. All right. Honey, I'm gonna be home around 6, okay? Stan? Okay? Stan! You bastard! I'll tell you who I do want to marry. Someone who doesn't mind when you piss on her shoes? The Bock's beer babe. - She's just this big-breasted, happy lady. - With beer. - Yeah, with beer. - Yeah. - And she's just sort of giving it out. - Distributing it. Just so happily, you know? She wants a commitment. Oh, thanks. Skee-Ball. Of course. What? - Go nuts, get homeless, Skee-Ball. - Yeah. It's a common progression. I've seen it a thousand times before. - I think if we're here to find Richie... - Over here. It's a good a place to start as anywhere. Oh, hey, I remember these things. - They're impossible. - No, you gotta have the touch. I won Cindy Goldclang four stuffed animals and a Timex. You went outwith Cindy Goldclang? - Before or after Richie? - Um... So he's really nice and everything, it's just that he's so... Yeah? It's like... Should I be honest? Yeah, but I'd rather you be Cindy. Don't be such a Donkey Kong. I'm serious, Daniel. So go on. Go on. Well, you know, Richie's really smart and fun and everything. Yeah? - All right, Richie! - Oh, God. Come on, just say it. Come on, say it. He won't make a move. I have to start everything. It's like he's afraid to touch me. - We haven't even gone to third base. - That's terrible. All right! And I spoke to Janie Ostrow and Janet Bierbaum... and they both said the same thing. You're kidding. Janet said he didn't even know how to French kiss. That's impossible. She gave him a hand job. Like, maybe. - Oh, man. - I know. - You dog. - I know. But how else am I supposed to get a shot at a fox like Cindy? He ever find out? I didn't tell him. Yeah, but what about Cindy? She had to have. I guess, maybe. - Excuse me, we're looking for... - Skee-Ball. No. Yes, I understand, but we're looking for... You read? - Yes. - Go outside. We just wanted to ask... Uh-uh. Go outside, tilt your head up, read the sign. - Look, you don't have to be like a... - Uh-uh. Go. Read. Sign. Skee-Ball. Says "Skee-Ball." - Not "Information." - Nope. So you came in here expecting maybe, what? - We just wanted to ask you... - Something of or relating to Skee-Ball? Not entirely. Well, maybe if there were some Skee-Ball involved in the transaction... I could help you out. It's a little slow. Good. Okay" First, the Skee-Ball. Got quarters? Another four tickets. Not bad. Going for that Buick. Christ on a crutch. What, you do the national pro tour? My grandmother had a place on the boardwalk in Long Beach... and every year my sister and I would play Skee-Ball all summer long. Th ree-fifty. And we saved all the tickets. Eventually had, like, a zillion. I figured I'd trade them in for, you know, a tank or something. The year that my grandmother was letting the place go... we figured, "Now's the time to trade them all in." Place burnt down first week of the season. - Took half the boardwalk with it. - Oh, the humanity. Gather ye rosebuds What? Gather ye rosebuds while ye may Yeah, right. How many we got? Oh, hey, they got some cool prizes up here. - How much for the clock radio? - Six thousand. We got 30. Okay. Okay. Thirty's good. I want that ring. Maybe I'll give it to Gabby. - She'll get a kick out of that. - Ring's 31. How about that plastic spider? I don't want the spider. I want the ring. The ring is 31 and you have 30. See the problem? For chrissakes, you can spot me one ticket. Uh-uh. House of cards. Whole thing comes crashing down: - Come again? - Say I spot you the ticket. - Yeah? - Then the ticket is free. Yeah? This ticket looks a awful lot like this ticket. - So? - Look, in any economy... currency simply serves as a representation... of the overall strength of that economy... ergo, the promise to pay. The paper, the coins, the Wampum and so on have no inherent value... only that which is put upon them. - So? - So... if there is not universal agreement on the value represented by that currency... that currency ceases to have any value at all. The entire economy collapses. Crash. Boom. We're standing in a field of mud... trading bags of rice delivered by the U.N. peacekeeping forces. - And? - And... your girlfriend's ring becomes a sad and fading token... of a happier time when society was actually functioning. Wow. And also, my boss does a ticket-prize inventory... and if it doesn't all square up, I get fired. - Well, spider's kind of cool. - I don't want the freaking spider! I want the damn ring! It's one damn ticket, and I don't give a shit about the economy! - There's your basic problem right... - Shut up! I hate guys like you. - I hate guys like that! - Hey, it's just a stupid game. It's not a game. Not if you can't win. I'm so goddamn tired of this shit. Hey, it's not a game if you can't really win, right? So I got a new one for you. Actually, it's kind of a special version. I'm curious what you think. Wow. I'll give you a couple of credits to start off with. After that, it's strictly cash, huh? - I want another babe. - Oh, yeah. Have another beer. - What? - Why did you wreck the place? - He pissed me off. - He's just doing his job. He's an asshole. - Shit. - What? We forgot to ask him about Richie. - Shit. - Well, we can't go back in there now. - Doesn't matter. - What do you mean? - We're here to find him. - That guy didn't know jack. You guys don't know jack. It's perfectly safe. See? Man, this bowl is beat, man. - No, it's not. - Yeah, it is. - So describe it. - It's, like, you know, it's... It's pink and wet. Never seen it. - Yes, I have. - I mean, for real, not Penthouse. Your brother's gonna shit when he finds out about his model. - And you haven't either. - At least I admit it. Okay. - I too have so seen some pussy. - You mean besides your mother's? - Hey, hey. No mothers, man. - Hey, man. All right, all right, all right. - Any second. Can't take it, huh? I could set you up with Janet Bierbaum. She'll do anything I tell her. What? - Yeah, right, Richie. - What? What? - I've been with half the girls in school. - Half? Cindy Goldclang, she's got the sweetest... - Please. - What? You don't believe it? Hey, forget it, man. Forget it. - Faggot. - Come on, man. - You're so full of shit. - Richie... I've seen more pussy than you'll ever. - Not according to Cindy Goldclang. - What? And Janet and Robin. They say you can't make a move. Don't do squat. - Says you can't even get a hard-on, man. - Fuck you. How would you know? You lying little... You just wanna... - Oh, shit. - Harsh, man. - Well, he started, you know? - You sure finished. What's that sound? Why do you think Richie lost it? I mean, wherever he is. He had all kinds of... Who knows. Hey, check it out. The Cyclone. It's like school. - No, it isn't. - Yeah, it is. You know how if you go back to school, as an adult, I mean... how it's all weird and hollow and smaller. And you just can't believe that it was the whole world. It's a roller coaster. Yeah, I know. I said it's like school. It's a lot more like a roller coaster than a school. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Fine. Okay, forget it. Forget it. Now, what is that sound? It's like... It's like God blowing into a Coke bottle. No, it isn't like God blowing... Please. What? Son of a bitch. It is. - Remember the day. - Huh? Remember the day with a picture. Come on, boys, just $2. Two for $3.50, one for each other. - No, thanks. We're busy. - What are you doing? - We're looking for somebody. - You found me. - I'm here. Ready to take your picture. - What the hell. Come here. - Come on, give it a shot. Pay the man. - No, I'm not gonna pay him. You wouldn't happen to know where that weird noise is coming from. Sure, that's the wind blowing through the wires on the Astroland tower. So it's more like God blowing into a violin. - You from around here? - Born and raised. I worked this boardwalk most of 7O years. - Seventy years? - There's nobody here. Well, not now. Not since the '70s, I guess. Not since anybody with a buck started going to Long Island. Well, it was nice meeting you. You must of been just a kid when you started. I was 5 years old. I used to brush the sand off the people's beach chairs for penny tips. There were a lot of people in chairs back then. I saved up till I could afford to buy my first camera. - And then the war came. - Bummer. Took some shrapnel in France, they shipped me right home. - Were you hurt bad? - My leg hurts when it's damp. And I don't see so good out of this eye. But I came home a hero. Met Miss Coney Island. - Who was that? - Lrish girl? At the end of every summer, there was this big pageant... you know, at the Steeplechase, where they'd crown Miss Coney Island. And she'd rule until the end of the next summer. Since I was the first local kid to come home with a medal... they let me crown her. And being no dummy, I asked her out on a date. She was like Rita Hayworth, but with black hair. Wow. So you boys ready to take a picture? - Wait a minute. What happened? - When? - To you and Rita. - Miss Coney Island. Is it worth a picture to you to find out? Yeah. Yeah. Sure, okay. She married me. We had a kid right away. A little girl. When she figured out I was gonna be nothing... but a guy working the Coney Island boardwalk, she left. She took off with a guy from Atlantic City. - That was it? You never saw her again? - What about your daughter? - I don't know. - And that's okay? I tried to find her. Why did you wanna stay working the boardwalk? I like it here. They turn the lights on at night. - It's pretty. - But... Listen, you guys wanna take a picture or what? I'm losing the light. Hey, maybe we ought to take one when we find Richie, you know? Why don't you take one now, and another one when you find Richie? Good plan. Come here. - Cut it out. Come on, will you? - All right, guys, smile. Get it, get it, get it. Hey, Richie, why don't you come and be in the picture? Yeah, come on. No, no, no. Allegra, let go. Allegra, let go. Over here, man. Come on. Nice locket, Gabby. Oh, thanks. My morn got it from her mom. Okay. - Wow, it's a long time, man. - It's good to see you. Yeah, you guys too. So you... You've been okay? - Yeah, yeah. - All right, get together. Like Old times, huh? - Yeah, yeah. - All right, let me take another one. Smile this time. Oh, man. - I don't believe it. - What? Come on, guys, smile already. Well, look who's here. Hi. Hi. Say cheese, shit, something. Hi. Hi. - Hi. - What's with him? So who you looking for? A guy about our age, my height, black hair, might not look so good. That describes a lot of people. He lives here? We hear he's homeless. A lot of them live under the boardwalk, near the aquarium. They can panhandle the visitors over there. - Most of them take off in the winter. - Where do they go? - A shelter, probably. - Which one? Christ, I don't know. Do I look homeless to you? Thanks for the picture, man. Thanks a lot. It was good to meet you. Hey, you know something? I saw a couple of folks living over in that empty lot... right across from the freak show. Maybe your friend's over there. Thank you. Thank you very much. I got your cup of sunshine right here. Hello? Hello, anybody home? Richie, you in there? Well, we'd better go in. - In? - The freak show. - No way. - Why? Because it's stupid, that's why. They'll take our money, take us into a dark room... show us a two-headed pig in formaldehyde. It's probably not even a two-headed pig. They probably stuck the extra one on with duct tape. - It's freaks, man, it's cool. - Or staples. - I think they're, like, illegal. - One of us. - One of us. One of us. - Stan. Stan. - They're the only thing open. - The whole thing's weird. It's freaks. Come on. You're a sick fuck. - Hey, I need that 20. - What 20? - The 2O you owe me. - I don't owe you any money. Yeah. Remember that time you were a half-hour late? - No. - Yeah... you were late to the thing that time. - So? - So I had to kill all that time. - So? - So I ended up losing 20 bucks... on the video poker. If you'd have been on time... then I wouldn't have played and I wouldn't have lost. So you owe me the money. - Twenty bucks. - Yeah. No. - Well, give me two. - What for? Interest. For chrissake. Two tickets, please. It's winter. Couple of the freaks are off. It's okay. But the really good ones are here, right? Oh, yeah. Hey. No outside beverages. Enjoy the show. - Hi. - Hi. - Is she the...? - I don't know. - What do you think? - I don't know. I've never seen one of them. Well, she's reading The Bridges of Madison County. Oh, that's pretty freaky. She's got two arms, two legs, normal head... Maybe she's Bad Haircut Lady. What did the sign outside say? Well, she's not Morgan the Monkey Boy. - Let's ask her. - I'm not gonna ask her. You ask her. I'm not gonna ask her. You ask her. - Can I help you? - Yes. We were wondering... - Hello. Yes, hi. Uh... Uh... - Are you...? - What he's trying to say is... Um... Well, it's just that you seem... rather, well, you don't seem... Uh... Well, I mean, in what way. In what special different way are you...? - Freaky. - Thanks. Oh, I'm the Bearded Lady. - Oh, good. We were just wondering. - Ah. Yeah. Yeah. But, with all due respect, you don't seem to... - What? - Well... it's just that there seems to be a lack of... - What? - Well, it's just that you're... I've seen better beards on Puerto Rican women on the IRT. Oh, well, I've had some electrolysis. - It's the off-season. - Still... But, hey, come back in summer, and jeez, Grizzly Adams. - Oh. - It's kind of a rip, don't you think? Sorry, GUYS- But, hey, check out the mustache. Very impressive. Yeah, but anyway, I'm not in the show. I'm just here to tell you the show's in there. Oh. Thanks. Some freak. Next we got the guy with a chip in his tooth. Amazing Nose Boy. He has one right in the middle of his face. Come on, Stan. Chill. Air Girl. She requires it to live. Ladies and gentlemen, no photography during the performance. Thank you for your cooperation. And now a little something for the ladies. Check it out. Ugh! Man. - Ok. He's pierced, I'll give him that. But it's not that freaky. Anybody could just... - Ah! Ah! Ah! - Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, it's just not right. It's just not right. - Oh, the humanity. - Why? Why? Why? Why? What do you mean why? For fun. - People do this shit for... Why? - Ew! Worse than that guy who nailed his balls to a 2-by-4. - You know, I think I heard about that guy. - For fun, mind you. Like, "It's Friday night, got a couple of hours to kill. I think I'll nail my balls to a 2-by-4." Oh, my God. His actual balls? - I gotta assume they were. - He pierces his testicles? - For fun. - Not just his scrotum? What do you mean, "just his scrotum"? I think that would be a little less painful. Just nailing your scrotum to a 2-by-4... is a walk in the park compared to nailing your testicles. - I'm just saying... - I wouldn't be caught nailing my testicles. But I've often found myself just nailing my scrotum. - Drop of a hat. - I thought you could do real damage. The real question is are the nails clean? Please, please. Baby, don't... Don't be like this. I said I'm sorry. I'll do anything. I will, I'll change. No, I can, I can. I will. You can't leave me... Leave me. No, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just... I'm just saying... Look, we've got something here. - You want menus? - Um... - That's just the specials. - Ah. What's good? There's fish-fillet sandwiches, chicken-breast something. Lots of stuff. - "Chicken-breast something"? - Look at that menu. Who could deal? It's longer than The Fountainhead. Look, maybe you can help us. We're looking for our friend. - Yeah. Black hair, 5'10", about our age. - Are you kidding? Do you know how many people come through here? - He's homeless. - Oh. The manager kicks them out as soon as he sees them. They steal the condiments. You know, mustard sandwiches. Ah. Well, his name is Richie. Richie Munoz. He's got black hair. He's used to wear kind of a bandana sort of thing. Sorry. They all kind of look alike after a while. So you gonna order something? Sure. Couple of dogs. With everything. Help yourselves to the condiment bar. So basically her entire job... is to bring the hot dogs from over there to over here. And drinks. Couple of Gel-Rays, please. Sorry about your friend. Huh? It's cold out there. It's a bad time not to have anyplace to stay. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, you live around here? In the projects. Hey, you ever see a guy named...? Named Richie? Might be acting a little strange? Not ringing any bells. - Maybe collecting garbage? - They all do that. Really? He's got black hair. - Good-looking kid? - Well, he was. Maybe I have seen him. Picking up bits and pieces. Sad. There's so many of them around here. Where? Where did you see him? Around. Up and down the boardwalk, on the street. They all come here when they can scrape together a buck. Or they go through the garbage. - Maurice. - Stan. Daniel. Pleasure. Let me ask you boys something. If you've been living with somebody... is it too much to expect they'd be home... when you get back from work at 11:00 at night? - No. - Not unreasonable. If you call the police to fill out a missing-persons report... but they tell you the person hasn't been missing long enough... so you tell the police that the person took all your money? Not really accusing them of anything, just to get the police interested. But then the police arrest the person anyway... and you gotta go down to the station and drop the charges. But it turns out that the police found a controlled substance on the person. So they're in jail for 10 days... and when they get out they're all pissed at you. - Well? - Um... What's the question? Just that... Just that you should be home when you say you will. - Yes. - Yeah. Well, that's what I thought. But I... Instead, I get, "Oh, you're so possessive. You're so insecure." Insecure, what? Because you love somebody? What's wrong with loving somebody? - Nothing. - It's good to love somebody. Well, that's what I... That's what I thought. Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie. - I'm sorry? - Moving out. Won't even talk about it anymore. Wow, what a drag. I should have known. It was too good to be true. - Well, don't be like that. - Oh, it was. It was. We had so much. A life. We were... Julie. - Hey! I'm only here because I love you. - You've been kind, but... - You look great. Thank you. But really... I am so sorry about what I said. I was just mad. - I only... - I can't live like this, Maurice. Really, I can't. It's just too much. - I need my own life, my own things. - I can give you that. But then it's not mine. You working? Here and there. I'll get by. Then stay until you get on your feet. You know? I mean, where are you sleeping? - That's none of your business. - I don't mean... I just mean... I can't be a burden to you. I won't let that happen. I have my pride. Please. Don't. There's... There's gotta be something that I can... - Please. Do you want me to beg? - Don't. I can't... - After all I've done. - There. You wanna own me. Nobody owns me. I'm sorry, baby... but we're just not gonna make it. But thank you. Thank you. I think we found Miss Coney Island. Thanks. Condiments? What can I get you? What? - I'm sorry, is that English? - I can't... - How can I...? - It is a long menu. Hamburgers, hot dogs... fish-filet sandwiches, chicken-breast sandwiches. Is the... fish fresh? Just coffee. And a Danish. So did Jojo give you any specifics about, you know... like, where his cousin saw him? - I don't know. No, just "the boardwalk." MAURICE: Oh, God...! "Wandering, picking up garbage and putting it into a shopping cart." Okay. Okay, now we're getting somewhere. You know, what kind of shopping cart? Was it A&P? Was it Sloan's? I don't know. Well, what kind of hat was he wearing? Was it a long coat? Was it a short coat? I mean, what color? I don't know. I got it second hand, remember? Well, it just seems like we're out here with nothing to go on. Why Can't you just enjoy the day? - You know, "gather ye rosebuds." - It's the middle of winter. - Learn to relax. Take it easy. - Oh, look who's talking. How often do we get to just hang out and just chill for a while? Maurice. You gotta start getting over it, man. - It's time to let go. - You just don't know. Come on. People come and go. That's life. Yeah, you can't let it crush you, you know? It isn't healthy. Love isn't healthy. The air isn't healthy. The water is... Nothing is healthy. Nothing that we need to live. Life is fatal. Man's got a point. But there'll be another Julie. Yeah, he wasn't so great. You can do better. There is no better. He is not a carburetor. He is not a carburetor. You don't just get a new one. You don't. Just saying Julie wasn't exactly flawless. When you love someone... If you don't love someone... with every single part of you, you are wasting time. You are a thief. Thief. What would you do with the rest of your life... when love is gone? - Go to work? - Have a couple of drinks, kick back. Read "Letters to Penthouse." You must think my life is pretty funny. But you have absolutely no idea what love is. We ought to be looking for Richie. Look in the alley in the back. They search through the garbage for food. Thanks, man. - Man. - You think it's him? You know, it's been so long. Been a long time. Think we'll recognize him? - It's only been a year. I'm just saying... - What's with the flowers? I don't know. What are you supposed to bring to a wake? My mom sent a bottle of something. Oh. - Hey, what's with your pants? - What? Your pants. You expecting a flood? What? I grew, okay? Since when? Well, let's see. I got this suit for graduation, so... I can't believe it's been a year since graduation. Hello. - Do you see him? - Nope. Wanna check his room? - Maybe we should... - Stanley. Daniel. Have you seen him? Where's my Richie? Mrs. Munoz. We thought... Isn't he here? No. L... No. Hey, guys. We are really, really sorry to hear about Allegra. - Thanks. - Where's Richie? We haven't seen him since Tuesday. He waited up all night at the hospital with Allegra until... The doctor thought she was gonna come out of the coma, but... He just took off. We don't know where he is. My two babies. Where are my babies? - Excuse me. - Leave me alone. I'm not doing nothing. - Hey, take it easy. - Yeah, we're just looking for a friend... Get your hands off me. Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I said get off me! Trying to get something to eat. Well, here. Get something inside. What, are you kidding? I wouldn't pay for this shit. Meat is murder. You coming, Richie? Come on. Holy shit. - Richie. - Huh? Richie, it's us. It's Daniel and Stan. It's me, Stan. You remember us? Oh, hi. Hi, guys. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - We were looking all over for you. You can't just go. Don't. Wait, let's go get a bite to eat or a cup of coffee. You know, sit down a second, okay? Oh, okay. I'm gonna stay here, all right? Whatever. Coffee, huh? What about Jimmy Hong? Remember? "Hong Kong" Hong? Broke his hand on a cinder block? Nope. Janet Bierbaum. You've gotta remember Janet Bierbaum. She had those tits. I mean, in the eighth grade, she had tits. - And you said that you and her... - Really? What about Cindy Goldclang? Look, man, the thing about Cindy... Now, I wanted to... For everything. What we did, what I said... It was out of line. Uh-huh. If I had known that you... I mean, we were kids, you know? I didn't know. I didn't know it was gonna be such a big deal. - What? - Well, you and Cindy. Or anybody. The girls, I mean. - What are you talking about? - You're not making much sense. I let you down and I'm really, really sorry. And I'm sorry that I hurt you. You didn't hurt me. You got me coffee. No. No, I mean... So... you're okay? Sure. Fine. You got everything you need? Oh, yeah. Place for everything and everything in its place. Mm-hm. Look, I gotta ask you... what are you doing here? Why Coney Island? It's winter. Isn't everything closed? No, Skee-Ball's open. And at night they turn on the Wonder Wheel lights. It's pretty. Yeah, we've heard. So I guess... we'll see you around. - Stan? - What? Well, we should... We gotta... You need some money? Yeah. Yeah, you need some money? Not really. - Here. Here's... - Wait a minute. - Seven dollars. - Yeah, here's a five. Oh, thanks. Wait, wait. Richie, wait. Why don't you come back in to the city with us, you know? Maybe wash up a little, hang out? - Maybe see your morn, you know? - No. No. - I'm gonna... - But, Richie... Good seeing you guys. Keep warm. Cup of sunshine. You too. - Gonna be cold tonight. - Yeah. - Be dark soon. - Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Gabby gonna be worried? No. I left her a note at work. A note? What did you say: "Went to Coney Island on a mission from God. Be back by 5"? No. It was a nice note. - She'll be okay, she's a big girl. - Yeah. Christ, I could use a drink. You got any money left? So you got any money for me? - What? - You know the hole you're in? - Maybe 200, big deal. - No. Counting today? Two grand-seventeen. Jesus. Don't mess with me, man. You know that's not true. And no one's gonna front you because they know you can't make the vig. You were a lousy kid, Stan. You're still lousy. Two grand-seventeen. You got a week. Two bucks, that's it? I need my token to get home. All right. All right. Give me the Night Train. Oh, Jesus. What? It's cheap. Oh, look, there's lighter fluid on the top shelf. It's quicker and cheaper. Your health. Man, he looked so... Yeah. He looked different. But okay. - He had all his teeth. - He was so skinny. - Kind of smelled a little too. - Yeah, think? Well, at least he's not dead. He's doing okay. Didn't seem that crazy. So, what do you wanna do now? What, that's it? What? That's it? It's over? He was our best friend. We should do something. His mother doesn't know if he's alive or dead. I mean... - Hey! - What? Bumper cars. Cool! What the...? Stan. Excuse me, we were talking about something. Say, mister. The cars running today? - In theory. - What is your problem? - Now, look, I'm not really open yet. - Daddy, can I bump them? - Bump my kid? - Sure. Plenty. Okay. Hop on. Excuse me, we... You are a goddamn 4-year-old. So is your old man. I cannot believe that I let you drag me all the way to Coney Island for... For what? Look out. You don't give a shit. You think this is fun. Yeah, this is fun! Good one! Richie is a real person. He was our best friend. We gave him 12 bucks, what do you want? - Well, I wanna help him! - He doesn't want any help. Better get on the stick. I mean, you know, what if he's sick? What if he's in trouble? I mean, he could freeze to death out here. It's, like, 13 degrees below zero. And there is something wrong with him. He didn't remember anybody... Whoo-hoo! Goddamn it. Watch you get drunk, talking shit all day. I am goddamn sick of it! Come and get me, Danno. Come all the way out here on a wild goose chase... We actually find Richie and you just walk away. You know, I am gonna get fired. You don't give a shit. Blow off my girlfriend... Damn it. All you wanna do is have a half-dozen beers and forget about everything. Whoo-hoo! Psych. Hey, pick on someone your own size. - Moron. - Dickweed. You can't just do every stupid thing you wanna do. People... You can't just... You gotta... You gotta pay rent. You gotta take care of people. You gotta show up. You can't just be a lazy, dumb-ass loser drunk! Who are you? You sit in a fucking cubicle all day with your stupid tie. I'm a loser? Right. You got your fucking pen nailed down to a fucking chain. Who gives a shit if they steal your pen? It's a goddamn pen. What the hell's the matter with you, you pussy? Your job is shit. Your girlfriend's ugly. Your life is shit, you piece of shit. Hey, mister. Don't fight. It's just bumper cars. Oh, Jesus. What the hell happened? I mean... I think I'm bleeding. Oh, man. We were the shit. Remember the Removes'? Man, we were the shit. We were kids. But everything looked so good. I had money, I had... Remember that leather jacket with the collar? I had that. I had Gabby. You still have Gabby. No. I don't. I gave you a week. A week. I made an exception for you. You give me nothing. What am I supposed to do with you? - I can. Tomorrow. - What? - I'll get you something tomorrow. - How? I swear. Shit. I'll give you 90 bucks. What? That's a family heirloom. Oh, okay. Eighty-five. No, no, no. You don't understand. My girlfriend's grandma gave her that. That's old, man. You keep talking and the price goes down. This girl, she's... She'd rub my forehead when my leg got really bad. Down. My head would be... And all I could do is cry until the pain would make me black out. - And she'd rub my... - Down. Forehead and all I could see around her neck, all I could see was... - Down. - Was this. Sixty bucks. Take it or leave it, all right'? Fuck you! Fuck you! - It's worthless. - Huh? Your grandmother doesn't give a shit about you. - What are you talking about? - Ninety bucks. That's it. - Stan. - I'm in trouble, all right? So I need some help. But this... You said this was worth something. It ain't worth shit. - You tried to sell my locket? - Ha! What is wrong with you? - What happened to your face? - Leave me alone. It's not there, I threw it out. What? You said you were gonna stop drinking, so I got rid of it. Goddamn you. Bitch! That's it. I'm leaving. I fucking can't believe your ass. So I guess I'm gonna be at my mom's. You... Do you have any idea how screwed I am? Do you? I am so fucked. So don't call me. It'll be just... It'll be easier. - He'll kill me. - Who? Honey, he'll kill me. He doesn't care. - What is this, Stan? - Look at me. He did this. I owe him money. Two thousand. He hit me, baby. He beat me with a bat. I'm gonna give you this money. It's $1300. But after this, no more. And I don't want you to find me. I don't want you to call me. I just... I've waited so long for you... and you just... You just get worse and worse. - If I thought you... - I can change. I'll change. This is... This'll fix it. After this... Remember that picture of me looking like the Jerry Mahoney doll? Yeah. Yeah, you and your dad. With the bow tie. Yeah. Sitting on my Dad's knee. Before the operation. With my sister. You know what I realized? I'm already older now... than my Dad was in that picture. I mean, he had a wife... two kids... and what the hell am I doing? Working in a pizza shop. Drinking too much. That what you mean? Yeah. That. Well, I guess it's been better. At least you're not wearing that stupid Jerry Mahoney outfit. I still feel like that kid. But Mommy and Daddy aren't here anymore. Stuck in no-man's land. Or living on Coney Island. Oh, shit. Yeah. We gotta go get Richie. Maybe he's at the aquarium catching the new Sea-Monkeys show. My Sea-Monkeys died. Everybody's Sea-Monkeys died. Yeah, they're probably closed by now, anyway. I wish these guys were open. I could use a cup of sunshine about now. Hey. - What? - You think...? You think he's...? - I can't see anything, can you? - Just garbage. A lot of garbage. That could be him. Why don't we check it out? - Go down there? - You got x-ray vision? Jeez. - Creepy. Oh, boy. What? Jackpot, I guess. Look at the dates. The newest one's three years old. Maybe he has the new ones with him. Yeah, and maybe he lives here because he likes the view. Hey, guys. Good to see you again. Yeah. Yeah. - This is where you live? - Right now. Sometimes they make you move. So, Richie, what's with all these toys? Oh, a place for everything and everything in its place. It's something to do. There's all these broken dolls that need to be fixed. Look at this one. See? All he needs is insides. They took his insides out. Richie, why did you leave? I needed to get some supplies. No. No, I mean, back then. Back when... We went to your mom's house, back when Allegra... Yeah, you know. Oh, I killed my sister. I thought I should go. - What? - Yeah. I killed her. - But Mom said to wait at home. - No, she didn't. - But I wanna watch Rainbow Brite. - You'll see it tomorrow. Rainbow Brite, Rainbow Brite, Rainbow Brite. Look, stop! I'm telling. If I buy you a piragua, will you shut up? - Two flavors? - Sure. Stay close and don't say anything, okay? .. Anything." Hey, Darcy. Hey, Richie. Hey. So... Yeah? - How's it going? - Okay, you know... last day. - What? - I leave for Rhode Island tomorrow. College. But I... - Wow, college. - Yeah. Yeah. Stay here and don't move. Like this? You think you're going to Great Adventures? - But you promised. - Just don't move. But you promised Great Adventures. Well, I promise if you move, you're not going. He promised. You make a promise, it's a promise. So college. You gonna...? Will you be back ever? Oh yeah, you know, Christmas, Easter. Oh. Hey, you look good. Thanks. I got this at Morris Brothers. Hey, looks tight. Well, you know. Man, Celia Cruz is fat. Oh, yeah, but she can sing good. Yeah. She's at S.O.B.'s a lot. Maybe one time we can...? No! Allegra! Are you still taking your pills? No. Why not? Because I felt okay. You're okay? - Yeah. - What are you talking about? Your mother doesn't know if you're alive. You're living in a garbage dump... and you don't even know who you are anymore. Stan. You were a regular guy. Now you're acting like a crazy person. - Stan. - What? Look. These pills... they made you feel normal, right? You felt okay. Yeah. - So you stopped taking them. - Yeah. So how do you feel right now? Do you really feel okay? - No. - I'll say. - These freaking dolls... - Stan. "St. John's Mental Health Clinic." Remember where that is, Richie? Um... Yeah. Lithium, Dilantin, Depakote, had seizures. Your friend's manic depressive? We don't know. He's messed up. He hasn't been taking his medication for three years. - Are either one of you relatives? STAN: Nope, old friends. Well, we can keep him here 10 days for evaluation. They'll probably prescribe another round of medication. Look, he thinks he killed his sister. I think that's what drove him crazy. No, it didn't. It doesn't work like that. Your friend is ill. He has a chemical imbalance. He's probably always had it. - Yeah. I guess so. - Look, does he get a phone call? This isn't jail, honey. There's a pay phone right back there. Hey, how are you doing? Okay. I'm okay. You Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Richie, is it all right if you stay here for a couple of clays? Yeah. We were thinking you ought to call your mom. Yeah, that'd be good. No. No. She... I'd better not. I'm sure she'd really love to hear from you. She misses you, man. ' 'Ii She doesn't even know you're alive. I can't. I can't talk to her. What do I tell her? I can't tell her. Richie, you didn't kill Allegra. You just didn't. It was an accident. They happen all the time. I can't. I can't. Let's just call her. All you have to do is say "hello." Jesus, don't you remember anything? Remember going to Playland? Remember the neighborhood? That fat kid With the... - What was his name? - Who? - The fat kid with red hair. - Oh, flinched every time you went like this: Yeah, that guy. With the thing on his ear. - Tommy Westerfield. - That's it. The guy... I'll be damned. You are in there. Look, Richie, you're sick. You're not thinking right. No matter what you think, your mom loves you. - I know she wants to hear from you. - She told us. I can't convince you about your sister. You believe what you're gonna believe. But there's enough of you left to remember us. And the Richie we knew would do this thing. Just this one thing. We can call your mom. Just this one thing. Hello, Ma? I'm okay. No, don't cry, Mom. I miss you too. I'll see you soon. - Think he'll be okay? - I don't know. I guess. Yeah, why not? At least his mom is happy. - She knows he's alive. - Yeah, that's something. Look at him. He was one of us. Just like us. Now he's... There's nothing left of him. We did all the same shit. Same school. Hung out. Yeah, he just went off somewhere. Yeah, but doesn't it scare you? Doesn't it scare the shit out of you? He's got nothing. He's got nobody. Maybe that's the difference. We do. Yeah. Stan. Stan? Hey, wait up, man. Hey. Hey- Stan? I'm telling. Fuck it. I'm telling. Get off of there! - What the hell are you doing? - I'm calling the cops. That's cheating. I'm no different. How many screwups am I away from where Richie is right now? Give me a ball. - Hello? - I already lost Gabby. Work is shit. "A place for everything and everything in its place," right? I want the police department. What's the number? - I hope you don't think I'm gonna... - Stop talking. Here. Here's 47 tickets. Give me the 31-ticket ring. Keep the rest. - You still don't get... - Nothing you say matters to me. - But... - Nothing you say means anything. - But... - Stop talking! - But... - Stop talking... or you'll be doing the ticket-prize inventory out of your ass. It's stupid. I know it's stupid, but maybe she'll take me back. Maybe if she takes me back, I can straighten out my life. A little bit. At least a little bit. It's the household magic of ordinary days. The whole world turns and doesn't make a sound. Caterpillars become butterflies. Can openers turn into wire hangers. When you're not looking, just minding your own business... the biggest stuff happens. What's weird is you don't even notice it. We went to Coney Island on a mission from God. Nothing amazing happened... but everything changed. To Stan and Gabby. Long life and happiness. Cheers. Nice going, Daniel. Good speech. - Nice going, man. Daniel. Oh, that was very beautiful. Thank you. Mrs. Munoz. Where is he? We held a place for him. Oh, he checked out of the clinic. He hadn't been taking his medication for a few weeks. He had the doctors fooled. He always was the smart one, huh? Where did he go? I don't know. I can only hope that God is watching over him. I am so sorry. - If there's anything you need... - Oh, no, thank you. You've already done so much. So, Gabby, where did you find that dress? He's gone again, isn't he? To absent friends. Absent friends.
