Goodnight, my child. Goodnight, sweet child. The balcony is still open! What anguish! Doesn't your affection give you words? Why are you so sad? Father - my lord - The quiet country air once soothed your heart. You have fled here to escape the unworthy foreigner. Leave the future to me. Confide in your father, who loves you so. Ah, father! What troubles you? Do not weep. Oh, remorse! I leave you now. Ah, my father! God bless you. Goodnight. Goodnight. I feared he would stay until tomorrow! I'll open the balcony window again. All's ready, let us go. Can so loving a father oppose my wishes so strongly? No, no, I cannot decide. What are you saying? His words were like daggers in my heart. Had he not gone out, I should have confessed all... And then tomorrow Don Alvaro would lie in his own blood or else be imprisoned in Seville, and then, perhaps, hanged. Silence! And all this because he loves one who doesn't care. I not love him? You know well how I love him my country, my family, my father am I not leaving all for him? Ah, my misfortunes are too great to bear! An orphan and a wanderer, far from my native land, a pitiless fate drives me on, to a foreign shore; tortured by fearful dreams, broken with remorse, this poor one's heart is condemned to eternal weeping, I leave thee, alas, alas, in tears, sweet homeland! Farewell. Alas, so great a sorrow has no end! Farewell. If you can help me, milady, we can leave sooner. And if he doesn't come? It's late. It's past midnight! Ah no, he will not come! What's that? The sound of horses' hooves! It is he! I knew he would not fail! O Dio! Ah! forever, now, my angel, heaven has joined us. As I hold you in my arms, heaven itself rejoices with me. Don Alvaro! Heaven, what's the matter? It's almost daybreak. A thousand things have kept me, all night long, from getting to your home. But the charm of so pure a love as ours overcomes all obstacles. It was God who willed that our yearning should bring us to this present joy. Throw these things down into the courtyard... Stop! Follow me, leave, at last, your prison... On heaven! I cannot bring myself to do it. Horses are ready below; a priest is waiting at the altar - come, my dear, take shelter in my love, and God, from Heaven, will give us the blessing. And tomorrow, when the sun-god of India lord of my royal race bathes the earth again in his splendour, he will shine on our wedded joy. It is late... Come, be quick! Wait a moment... Eleonora! Tomorrow... What are you saying? I beg you, wait. Tomorrow! Tomorrow we shall leave. Once more I want to see my father, my poor dear father and you are glad of it, are you not? Yes, because you love me you'll not forbid it... And I too - you know it - I love you so! And that makes me happy, oh heaven, how happy! My heart is bursting with joy! Let us stay - Yes, Alvaro mine, I love you! I love you! Your heart is bursting with joy - yet you weep! Your hand is as cold as death! I have understood, my lady! Alvaro! Alvaro! Leonora! I alone shall suffer. God forbid that your weakness lets you follow me. I release you from your promise. To marry would mean death for us - if you love less than I, if remorse... I am yours, with all my heart and all my love! I'll follow you to the end, the farthest end of the earth; with you, unafraid, I shall face the evil fate of war, and for me there will be nothing but the constant joy of love. I shall follow you - let us go, for fate shall never, no never, keep us apart. You are the breath, the light, the soul of this heart which loves you; so long as the breath of life is in me, my sole, unchanging desire shall be to give you your every wish. Follow me - let us go, for fate shall never divide us. That noise! They are coming up the stairs! Let us leave Follow me/I shall follow you, let us go, for fate shall never, never divide us. It is late. Then we must be calm. Holy Virgin! Hide in there. No. I must protect you. Put it back. Would you, against my father? - No, against myself! Horror! Vile seducer! Shameless daughter! No, father... I am your "father" no more. I alone am the guilty one. Strike - have your revenge - No, your conduct shows the baseness of your origins - Sir! Stand aside... Arrest the scoundrel. Whoever moves shall die. Alvaro - heaven, what are you doing? I yield only to you. Strike! Die by my hand! Such a life as yours is for the hangman. Signor di Calatrava! Pure as the angels is your daughter - this I swear; the guilt is mine alone. Let any doubt which remains be dispelled by my death. You see me unarmed. I am dying! Oh, cursed weapon! Help! Away from me! The sight of you sullies my death. Father! I curse you! Heaven, have mercy! Hol?! hol?! hol?! Welcome here, o muleteer, for a fine night's rest. Hol?, hol?, hol?! Here is the place you'll find a glass to build up your strength once again. Welcome here, o muleteer, for a fine night's rest. Dinner is ready. To dinner, to dinner! In vain I seek my sister and her seducer... Faithless ones! You shall bless our meal. Let the student say grace. Willingly. In nomine patris, et filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. What do I see! My brother! Good. Excellent. It asks to be eaten. "Tu das epulis accumbere Divum" She knows no Latin, but she can cook. Long live our hostess! Aren't you eating, Master Trabuco? It's Friday. You are fasting?Exactly. And that little one who came with you?... Hurrah for the war! Preziosilla! Brava, brava! Here, next to me... Here, next to me... Who wants to make his fortune? All of us, all of us! Then go as soldiers to Italy, where war has broken out against the Germans. Death to the Germans! Eternal flail of Italy, and of her sons. We'll all go, we'll all go. And I with you. Hurrah! To the sound of the drum, to the dash of the steed, to the blue swarm of the soldier's steel; to the rustling of the field our thoughts now rise! How beautiful is war! How beautiful is war! Hurrah for war! Hurrah for war! The one who dies as a coward is forgotten but the corageous soldier is full of glory and honour. How beautiful is war hurrah for war! If you will come, my brother, you shall be made corporal, and you a colonel, and you a general; and the little god with the winged bow will reward you in victory. How beautiful is war, hurrah for war! And what is in store for the student? Ah, you shall pass through most horrible woes - What are you saying? My lips have never lied... But you, dear lad, I do not believe you... You are no student, I shall not betray you, but no one can make a fool of me, tra la la la! Tra la la la! Hurrah for war! Eternal Father, Lord,have mercy on us. Holy Son, Lord, have mercy on us. Holy Spirit, Lord, have mercy on us. One and Triune Lord, have mercy on us. Who are they? Pilgrims on their way to the jubilee. If only I could escape. Let's wait for them to pass. Then let us, too, kneel in prayer. Yes, let us pray. Over us, who humbly pray Thee, extend Thy hand, O Lord; from the suffering of hell, save us in Thy goodness. Lord, have mercy on us! Ah, save me from a brother thirsting for my blood; from the suffering of hell, save us in Thy goodness. if Thou dost not will it, then nought shall save me, O God! Lord, have mercy on us! if Thou dost not will it, then nought shall save me, O God! Lord, have mercy on us! Hurrah for our goodly company! Health to us here, eternal glory later... So be it. Are you already with the angels, Trabuco? What - in a hell like this? And the little one who came with you, why? For the Jubilee? I do not know. By the way - a cock or a hen? A traveller's money is all I ever notice. And a wise man you are! You saw them come. Why didn't the stranger join us for dinner? They said the stranger asked for vinegar and water. Ha, ha! As refreshment! It might be. The stranger is gentle and beardless, right? I know nothing, I know nothing. He won't talk! I'm still speaking to you. The stranger straddled the mule or rode side-saddle? What a bore! And came from where? Sooner or later, I know, I'll get to Heaven. Because Purgatory lies in talking with you... Where do you go now? To the stable, to sleep with my mules, who know no Latin, who aren't Bachelors of Arts. Ha ha! He's escaped! Since the stranger is beardless, let's paint him a moustache - a good joke for tomorrow. Bravo, bravo! I must protect all travellers; I'm against this joke. Wouldn't it be better if you told us where you come from, where you're going, and who you are? Would you like to know? This is my story. I am Pereda, rich in honours, Salamanca made me a Bachelor; soon I shall be, in utroque, Doctor, for only a few studies are left to be done. Vargas took me from there a year ago and brought me with him to Seville. Pereda refused no challenge, his heart spoke out for his friend. A foreigner, his sister's lover, had murdered his father, and the son, like the brave knight he is, swore vengeance against the killer. We followed them as far as Cadiz but could not find the guilty pair. For his friend, Pereda suffered, for his heart spoke out for him. There, and every place else we went, we heard that the girl had perished with her father, and that in a fight with the servants and guards only the seducer escaped. I then went away from Vargas, while he swore to track down the killer. He sailed then for America and Pereda returned to his books. Pereda's is a grim story, showing his nobleness of heart! Well told. This Marquis was killed? Well? And the lover carried off the daughter? Yes. And you, gallant, faithful friend, went to Cadiz from Seville? Ah, no one can make a fool of me - Tra la la la! My children, it is late; let us give thanks to God for our meal and let's be off. Let's be off, let's be off. Good night, good night Hol?! Hol?! Time to go to rest. Good cheer, muleteers! Hol?! I am Pereda, rich in honours... Ah, tra la la la! But no one can make a fool of me. Good night. Let's be off. At last I am here! I give thee thanks, o God! This is my last refuge! I am here! I am trembling! My horrid story is known at the inn - told by my brother! If he had discovered me! Heaven! He said that Don Alvaro has sailed to the west! He did not die that night when I, wet with my father's blood, followed him, only to lose him! And now he leaves me, he flees from me! Alas, I cannot bear this anguish! Mother, merciful Virgin forgive my sin. Grant that I may cleanse my heart of his memory. In this solitude I shall expiate my sin. Have mercy on me, Lord. Do not forsake me, O my God "Venite, adoremus ante Deum et procedamus" Ah, this heavenly song... The organ's sweet tones, rising like holy incense to God in Heaven! May this music bring comfort, comfort and peace to my troubled soul! Now I shall go to the holy refuge dare I at this hour? But they might take me by surprise! Oh, wretched Leonora, how you tremble? The pious monk will not refuse you shelter. Do not abandon me, succour me, O Lord, in thy mercy, Ah, do not abandon me! Have mercy on me! Who are you? I wish to speak to the Superior. The church opens at five o'clock If you have come for the Jubilee. Please, call Father Superior What an hour for asking mercy! Father Cleto sent me. That holy man? And for what reason? An urgent one. But why? An unfortunate soul - The same old tune!... but I'll open for you. Come in. I cannot. No? Are you excommunicated? You had better wait outside. I'll announce you, and if you don't come back, then good night. But - if he refuses me! He is said to be merciful; he will protect me. Holy Virgin, help me. Who asks for me? It is I. Speak. It is a secret... You may leave, Melitone. Always secrets! And only these holy men must know them! We are but so much... Brother, what are you muttering? I was saying that the door is heavy and noisy. Too many screws. We see who's head man here! Now we are alone. Now we are alone. I am a woman. A woman at this hour! Great God! An unhappy, disappointed, rejected woman, cursed by heaven and earth, who throws herself in tears at your feet and begs you to bring her back from hell. And how can a poor monk do that? Has Father Cleto written to you of me? You come from him? Yes. Then you...are Leonora de Vargas! You shudder! No. Come, trusting, to the Cross. Let the voice of Heaven speak to your heart. My soul is now at peace, since coming to this refuge; the fearful ghouls have ceased to war upon me... no longer does the bloodstained ghost of my father haunt my sight; no longer does the frightful curse of a father torture his daughter's mind. The daring of Satan has always been powerless here. That is why I seek my tomb here, among the rocks, where another woman lived. What! You know of her? Cleto told me. And you wish - To give myself to God. Woe to him who is deluded by a moment's delirium! For one so young as you the punishment would be all the worse. Ah, my soul is at peace Woe to him who is deluded! Woe! Who can read into the future? And can tell your heart won't change? And your lover? Unwillingly, it was he who killed my father. And your brother?... He has sworn I shall die by his hand. It would be better if you sought refuge within some convent's holy doors. A convent? A convent? No! If you send me, repentant, away, I shall wander through the mountains calling for help, asking refuge from the cliffs, food from the woods, and moving the very beasts to pity. Ah yes, here I have heard the voice of Heaven saying "Save your soul at the foot of this Cross" You send me away? You? This is my haven. Who can take this solace from me? Glory to Thee, o merciful God, Omnipotent Father of the sorrowing, who livest among the spheres! May Thy will be done! Your decision is final? Yes. Then God will welcome you. Divine goodness! Only I shall know who you are. Among the rocks you will find a cave; there you will stay. At a nearby spring, each seventh day, I shall leave a frugal meal for you. Let us go. Melitone? Let all the brothers come, with lighted candles, to assemble in the temple of the Lord, at the High Altar. At dawn you will go alone, on foot, to the hermitage; but first let the holy bread bring comfort to your soul. Go now to put on your holy garb, and may your heart be strong, ah! upon the hard, new road the Lord will send you help. Eternal God, thy mercy shines upon the rejected one! A strange new joy has told me - I am blessed once again! Within my breast I feel a new birth of life in my heart; sing praises, o ye heavenly choirs, for the Lord has forgiven me my sin. Thanks to Thee, O Lord. Go now put on you holy garb, and may your heart be strong. The Holy Name of God our Lord be blessed A soul has come, repentant of its sin, to seek salvation in these hills. For this soul, we open the holy grotto. Do you know where it is? We know it. That haven is sacred, inviolate. No one shall approach it. We shall obey. Nor shall the humble barrier which separates us from it ever be crossed. We shall not cross it. On him who dares to break this rule or tries to learn the name or secret of this soul - a curse shall fall! Maledizione! Maledizione! A curse, a curse shall fall! Let Heaven hurl its thunderbolts to strike such a man to ashes. Let all the elements be loosed upon him, let his vile ashes be scattered in the winds Arise and leave us. No living person will see you again. From your cave the bell will warn us if danger threatens you, or, if your last hour has come... Then, we shall hasten to comfort your soul, before its return to God. May Our Lady of the Angels shield you beneath Her mantle, and may the Holy Angel of God keep vigil to protect you. May Our Lady of the Angels shield me beneath Her mantle, and may the Holy Angel of God keep vigil to protect me. Attend to the game, attend to the game.. Un asso a destra.Ho vinto A three-spot on the right... Five on the left.I lose. Life itself is hell to the sorrowful. I seek my death in vain! Sevilla! Leonora! Oh, the memory! Oh, night when all I love was torn from me! Ch'ogni ben mi rapisti! My sorrow shall have no end - it is written so. My father sought to free his native land from its foreign masters, and, by alliance with the last of the Incas, he hoped to win back his crown but all in vain! I was born in a prison; the desert was my only school; I am alive today only because my royal birth is known to none! My parents dreamed of a throne; the axe awakened them! Oh, when shall all my sorrows come to an end? O you who dwell among the angels, forever pure, lovely and untouched now by mortal sorrow do not forget to look down on me, who, exiled and nameless, defying fate, seek battle, like a wretched man, hoping to find there death. Leonora mine, help me, take pity on my anguish! Have pity on me! Betrayed! He shall die! What shouting! Help! I am coming. They have fled! Are you wounded? No. I owe my life to you. Who were they? Assassins. Inside the camp? I'll tell you the truth; it was a quarrel over cards. I see - off there to the right? Yes. But how did you, so noble of bearing, come to such a den of thieves? I'm new here. I arrived with orders from the general yesterday; without you I should now be dead. Tell me to whom I owe my life? To chance - ... First, I shall tell you my name. He must not know the truth! Don Felix de Bornos, aide to the chief. Io, Capitan dei Granatieri, Don Federico Herreros. The hero of our army! Sir! I have longed for your friendship I ask it now, hopefully. I shall be proud to have yours. Friends in life and death the world shall see us. United in life and death, men shall know us together. To arms! To arms! Let us go! - to arms! Going to the field of honour with you, I shall learn from you brave example. And, as witness of your courage, I shall admire your brave deeds. To arms! To arms! The battle is raging! Bravo, those grenadiers! Herreros is leading them... My God, he has fallen wounded! His men are yielding! His aide is rallying them - leading them in a charge! The enemy's on the run! Our men have won! Glory to Spain! Long live Italy!Victory is ours! They're bringing the captain here. Gently - put him here - prepare my bed. Silence! Is he in danger? I am concerned because of his chest wound. Save him! Where am I? With your friend. Let me die. Our care will save you. You will be rewarded with the Order of Calatrava. Of Calatrava! No, never - What! You shudder at the name of Calatrava! My friend... If you speak - One word only... Please, leave us for a moment. You must swear to me in this solemn hour, to carry out my wish. I swear, I swear. Near my heart, look A key! There you will find a package. I entrust it to your honour. Within, there is a secret which must die with me. Burn it when I am dead... I swear to do so. Now I can die in peace. I embrace you with all my heart. My friend, trust in heaven! Now I can die in peace. I embrace you with all my heart. My friend, trust in heaven! Farewell, farewell, farewell. To die! What a tremendous thing! A man of such courage and daring, yet he will die! An extraordinary man! But he shuddered at the name of Calatrava! Does he perhaps know of our dishonour? Heavens! What a thought! If he were the seducer? And in my hands he is alive! But if I am wrong? This key will tell me. Here are the papers! What am I doing? And the oath I swore? To him I owe my life? But I saved him, too! And if he were the cursed Indian who soiled my family's honour? I shall break the seal. No one can see me here. No? But I can see myself! Fatal vessel of my destiny, leave me now; you tempt me uselessly. I came here to redeem my honour I shall not lose it with this new shame. An oath is sacred to a man of honour; these papers shall keep their secret safe. May the evil thought which spurred me, to an unworthy act be put away forever. But if I might find some other proof? Let us see. Here is a portrait. It has no seal - he did not speak of it. I made no promise - let it be opened, then. Heaven! Leonora! Don Alvaro is the wounded man! Now may he live! Then, by my hand, he shall die! Good, news. He is saved. He is saved! He is saved! What joy! Ah, he is saved! What great joy I feel in my heart! At last I shall wreak my vengeance on the villain for his betrayal. Leonora, where are you hidden? Tell me - have you followed here the man who reddened your face with the blood of your father? Ah, I should be wholly happy if this sword of mine might dispatch both in a single blow down to the Lord of Hell! When the sound of fife and drum deafens the very earth, then we are glad, for war is life and joy to the soldier. A lively, adventurous life; tomorrow, like yesterday, counts for nothing, for every thought of ours is centred on today. Come to the fortune-teller, who has come from far away, for she can read the message of the dark, mysterious future. Come running, gather round her, reach out your hands to her, for she can tell if sweethearts have been faithful to you. He who longs for paradise must burn with valour and prepare to drive out the barbarous invader Ah! Come, come, come, you shall hear me predict what prize you will win from your fighting. Avanti, avanti, avanti. Here, girls, a a drink. To our health! To Spain and Italy united! Here's to our hero Don Federico Herreros! Hurrah! And to his noble friend Don Felix de Bornos! Who wants to buy? My prices are cheap - scissors and pins and wonderful soap. I buy and sell whatever you want, cash on the spot for all kinds of deals. Here is a bracelet - what will you pay? Here is a necklace. I'll sell if you wish. Here are some ear-rings, what will you pay? We want to sell - It looks to me like a lot of trash, a lot of trash. But let's make a deal for every piece. thirty pennies. We're dealing with a thief! Hey. what tempers! Let's talk about it. Maybe I can add a penny or two. Let me have it, now or never! First, right away, give us the money, shiny and ringing. First the goods, here, that's the way Here you are. Here you are. Good! To the devil with you! What a deal! What a deal! Who wants to buy? My prices are cheap! Bread, bread, for charity's sake! The war has destroyed our homes, our fields. We are starving. Give us bread, for mercy's sake. Our poor mothers wept as we left them, snatched away by cruel war. They have torn us away from all we love, our only wish is to go home again. Weep no more, young men, for your mothers and your sweethearts. We shall love you like sisters, and we know how to make you happy. Don't be frightened - we're not devils. Come now, dry your tears, for now it's plain - it's useless to think about the past. Shame on you! Shame on you! Come, be brave! Handsome lads - have you gone mad? If you blubber like babies your comrades will laugh at you. Take a look at what's around you, I'll bet you I can guess - you'll see lots of pretty faces which will comfort you tomorrow. Come now, courage, courage! In war it's only gaiety that can keep our hearts rejoicing; hurrah, then, for this madness which can flourish only here! Ho! Ho! What's going on? What an uproar! Fine goings on! And I'm in the midst. I came from Spain to bandage wounds and to salvage souls. And what do I find? Is this a Christian camp or are you Turks? Where was such derision of the holy Sabbath ever seen? In this army there are more bottles than battles! You're more concerned with bottles than with battles, and instead of donning sackcloth and ashes, here you're involved with Venus and Bacchus. The world has become a vale of tears; every monastery now is a den of empty air! The sanctuaries have become the lair of cut-throats; and Christ's temples are a sorry sight indeed. Everything's topsy-turvy, topsy-turvy and do you know why? "Pro peccata vostra", because of your sins. Ah, Holy Brother! You profane the Feast Days, you steal, you curse... Infamous friar! Go ahead, Reverend. And all of you are of the same stamp heretics, the lot of you. All of you, you are sewers of sin. And as long as you befoul the earth the world will know no peace. Give it to him! Give it to him, on the head! Let him go. Fighting with a monk! What brave sport! They can't hear me? Then the drum must save him. Rataplan, rataplan, rataplan Rataplan, rataplan, the love of glory burns brighter in the soldier; rataplan, rataplan, the beat of the drum promises victory in battle! Rataplan, rataplan, the ranks are forming; rataplan, and they're off to war! Rataplan, rataplan, the enemy's flag will soon be in retreat! Rataplan, pim pum pum, and fight onward when the foe turns his back and flees; rataplan, your glorious wounds will be rewarded by your triumph. Rataplan, the victory of one's country shines brighter for her sons' gallantry. Rataplan, rataplan, victory wins every heart for the soldier. will conquer the hearts of all. Voi, che si larghe cure mi prodigaste. Is your wound fully healed now? You are strong? As before. Could you fight a duel? But with whom? You have no enemies? We all have... But I do not understand... No? No? You've had no message from Don Alvaro, the Indian? Betrayal! Traitor! The secret, then, your oath, was broken? The papers were never opened the portrait told me. Tremble, for I am Don Carlo di Vargas. I am not disturbed by threats. Come out with me. Soon one of us will die. I am not afraid of death, but it grieves me to fight with one who offered me his friendship. No, no, no, do not profane the name of friendship. It was not I, but destiny, which killed your father; nor did I seduce that lovely angel. They both look down on us from Heaven, they tell you in your heart that I am innocent. And she? That fatal night I fell, with a double mortal wound. When I was well, I sought her for a year. Alas, I found that Leonora was no more! You lie, you lie! An old relative gave my sister shelter; I went to her, but it was too late ? My father from heaven cries: Revenge! Revenge! "Recupera l'onore della familia nostra" An old relative gave my sister shelter; I went to her, but it was too late. And she has fled. And lives! She lives, thanks be to God! Yes, she lives. Don Carlo, my friend, let the joy which moves me now tell you that my soul is incapable of baseness. She lives! Great God, that angel... But soon she will die. She lives, but soon she will die. No, let the hope of a marriage seal the bond between us. And she is still alive let us look for her together. Fool! I swear that a noble origin makes me your equal, and that my family's crest is resplendent, is resplendent as the sun. And she is still alive let us look for her together. Fool! Between us there gapes a bloodied tomb. How, can I greet as a brother the man who took all from me? Whether your origin is noble or base, my duty is to kill you, and, after you, the unworthy woman who betrayed her flesh and blood. What are you saying? What are you saying? Do not say it. I swear to God, she shall die. First you shall die in mortal combat. Death! If I do not fall in my own blood I shall find Leonora and I shall kill her with this sword still coloured with your blood. Death! Yes! With my sword I shall kill an assassin; turn your thoughts to God; your hour has come. and I shall kill her with this sword still coloured with your blood. Turn your thoughts to God; your hour has come. To death! Let us go! I killed him and I loved him! ...for Leonora! He was my brother! I killed him! Have mercy, oh, Lord! Give us charity, Give us charity, We must be on our way, we must be on our way, give us charity! What? Do you think you're at the inn? Be quiet... Here, quick, give me some Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. How many portions they're getting! They want the lot for themselves. Maria's had three helpings already! Four for me... Four for me... Yes, because I've got six children... And why have you got six? Because the good Lord sent them. Ah, yes, the good Lord... the good Lord. You wouldn't have them if, like me, you whipped your back with a rough scourge, and spent all your nights reciting rosaries and Misereres... Brother... But these beggars are really dreadfully fertile... Be charitable. Give us a drop of that swill. You rascals, you call this manna from heaven swill? Me, Father, me, me, me.. Oh, go to blazes, or I'll give you one on the head with this ladle right now! I'm losing patience! I'm losing my patience! Be kind to them. Father Raffaele was kinder to us. Yes, yes, but in a week he's had enough of the poor and the soup. He stayed in his room unloading the burden on to Melitone's shoulders. And now, how can I treat such a rabble kindly? The poor suffer so much... Charity is a duty. Charity for people who make a living out of it? The sort who'd knock down a church steeple with their fists, who call this manna from heaven swill.. Rogues and vagabonds! And who call this manna.. Oh, Father Raffaele! Don't pester me so! Don't pester me so! Here, take what's left, no more argument, etc. Get out of here, leave me, yes, out you go into the sunshine, leave me alone You're beggars worse than Lazarus, sacks of wickedness... Away with you, to the devil, you knaves, take yourselves off; you're beggars worse than Lazarus Oh, Father Raffaele! He was an angel! He was a saint! You have no patience Facendo carit? un dover s'adempie da render fiero un angiol... Che al mio posto in tre di finirebbe col "minestrar" de' schiaffi Tacete; umil sia Meliton, n? soffra se veda preferissi Raffaele. Io? No... amico gli son, ma ha certi gesti... parla da s?... ha cert'occhi. It's the prayers and the fasting. Yesterday in the kitchen garden he was working so furiously that in jest I said,,. Father, you're working like a black". He glared at me, and clenched his fists, and ? Well? When lightning struck the belfry, and he went out into the storm, I called after him, "You're like a wild Indian!" He let out a howl that froze my blood. What's worth repeating in that? Nulla, ma il guardo e penso, narraste, che il demonio qui stette un tempo in abito da frate... Could Father Raphael be a relative of his? Rash judgments; I spoke the truth, but it was revealed to the Father Superior then ? not to me. ma n'ebbe il Superior rivelazione allora... io, no Ci? ? vero! Ma strano ? molto il padre! La ragione? Disillusionment with the world, assiduous penance, vigils and abstinence trouble his mind. It'll be the disillusionment assiduous penance, vigils and abstinence that have addled his brain. Someone has come. Open. Are you the doorkeeper? A weird one, this. I just opened for you; I should think so - Father Raffaele? Another one! We have two Raffaeles - one from Porcuna, fat, deaf as a post; the other is lean, dark, his eyes... Heaven! What eyes! which one do you seek? The one from Hell. That's him, that's him! And who is calling? A gentleman - What manner! A nasty kind. In vain, Alvaro, have you concealed yourself from the world, and hypocritically made a monk's habit a shield for your baseness. Brother... Recognise me! Don Carlo! You - alive! For five years I have searched for you; at last I've found you, at last ah! at last I've found you... With blood alone can the disgrace and the crime be wiped out. That I should punish you is written in the book of fate. Once I lived among men - so I understand; now this robe, this retreat, show that I am making amends for my misdeeds, and that my heart is penitent. Leave me, leave me. Neither that garb nor the hermitage will be able to defend you - coward! Coward! What a word... No, no. Help me, o my Lord! Fierce words and threats, be carried off by the wind. Forgive, have pity, have pity, brother, have pity, have pity! Why offend in this way a man who was only unfortunate? Come, let us bow before fate, brother, have pity, have pity. You soil the very name of pity... Ah! When you went away, my sister remained, abandoned and betrayed, to infamy, to dishonour No, she was not dishonoured. It is a monk who gives you his oath. On earth, I adored her as only one in heaven can love. I love her still; if she still loves me, my heart cannot ask for more. My anger will not be quieted by base and cowardly words. Take up you sword, and come. do battle with me, o traitor! If now it is too late for either remorse or tears to speak for me. You shall see me as none has ever seen me - prostrate at your feet! Ah, the stain upon your crest is proved by this act! My crest shines brighter than a jewel. It is coloured by your half-breed's blood. You lie in your throat! - give me a sword! A sword! Lead on! At last! No, the devil shall not triumph. Go, leave me. You mock at me? Go. If now, you coward, you lack courage to measure swords with me, I condemn you to dishonour. Ah, now you have sealed your fate! Death to both! Ah! Morte, vieni, a morte andiam! Peace, peace, o my God! Cruel misfortune compels me, alas, to languish; for so many years have I suffered, as bitterly as at first. Pace, pace, mio Dio! I loved him, its true! But God had blessed him with such beauty and virtue that I love him still, and never shall I be able to efface his image from my heart. Ah, destiny! destiny! A crime divided us here below! Alvaro, I love you, and in heaven it is written that I shall never see you again! Oh God, God, let me die: for only in death shall I know peace. My soul sought peace in vain in this world, my soul, the prey of eternal sorrow. O wretched bread, which lengthens out this sorry life. But who comes now, daring to profane this sacred refuge? A curse upon him! A curse upon him! Cursed is the earth on which you walk! This is the devil's night! We are here! I am dying! Confession! Save my soul! This, too, is the blood of a Vargas. Confession! - I am damned; but nearby there is a hermitage... Come quickly, to console a dying man... I cannot. Brother! in the Saviour's name! I cannot. You must. Help! Help! Ah, come! Rash man, flee from the wrath of Heaven! A woman! This voice! Eleonora! Alvaro! - Leonora! So you were living near me, my love This moment will cancel all the moments of pain. They were living together! Sorella! What do I hear? Don Carlo, my brother, hold me near I am revenged! What have you done? Horror! I forgive you, brother! I am dying, you see, it's my destiny! I leave you.. Alvaro, I love you! We will meet in Heaven Leonora! I found you at the end! Yes! I found you dead! Great God! Blood! Corpses! The woman who made pennance! A woman? Great God! Imbecile, look for father Raffaele The hell sent me! I always said so Open, earth, the hell will swallow me! No mercy for the human race! Horror! Have pity, Lord!
