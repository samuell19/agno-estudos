THE FUTURE ANGLO AMERICA DEATH AND DISEASE ARE COMMONPLACE AIDS HAS OVERTAKEN CANCER AS THE BIGGEST KILLER OF THEM ALL THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR ANGLO-AMERICANS AT RISK! THE WORLD HAS NOT YES SEEN A HUMAN CATASTROPHE OF THIS SCALE THE GOVERNMENT SUGGESTS METHODS OF QUARANTINE AND STERILE CAMPS THE PEOPLE RIOT BUT OUT OF THIS LIFE OF VIOLENCE AND DECAY THERE COMES AN ANSWER HEX LABORATORIES ANNOUNCE THE IMMINENT RELEASE OF A TOTAL CURE TO AIDS A NEW DRUG TO SAVE HUMANITY SEROCAINE THE ONLY ANSWER When was the last time you told someone you had an affair? When was the last time you boasted about your sexual prowess without being dissed and distanced by your friends, shunned by your family and generally hated and ignored by the rest of society? How long? Too fucking long! But now there're radically bodacious & futuristically beneficial discoveries in the field of medicine! Those gnarly guys at the HEX Laboratories have found the answer. The only answer for AIDS, HIV and related diseases. It's called SEROCAINE, dudes, and from April 23rd it's available worldwide so I want all of you babes and babettes to order your bottle early! It's time for us to have the kind of fun our grandparents had, dudes! So remember, babes and babettes, dudes and dudettes, on April 23rd fucking is no longer a dirty word. SEROCAINE THE ONLY ANSWER Brian? Brian? Brian? Brian, are you listening to me? I'm sorry, Tara, I was just thinking. Do you really think they have found the answer this time? It's been so many years, hasn't it? So much shit has happened to the world. It's difficult to believe it will all change overnight. Brian, you've got to be positive. You can't worry about anybody else. Besides, your father says the cure's genuine. My father's a doctor, not a prophet. Suppose they do find a cure for AIDS? What about the poverty, the crime, the killing, the injustice? Who's going to put a stop to all that, eh? Aren't any superheroes left. There's no-one to stop the rot. Dr. Hex, this is Dr. Bosch from laboratory 36, section 9. We've been observing the SEROCAINE sample 0054321. Age 366 days. I ought to read to you my report: at this stage the SEROCAINE seems to be rapidly disappearing and dissolving. Its stable configuration in the infected sample completely falls apart, and it's resulted in an immediate reversing of the healing process. Well, SEROCAINE at this time seems to cause the death of the cell, the tissue and the sample. I'm very sorry to have to tell you this but you have to know that now. I'm sorry, Dr. Hex, but it seems we need a lot more time to perfect SEROCAINE. Interfering old fuck! No-one stands between Hex and his vision! - Right, boys? - That's right, Dr. Hex. Yes, that's right. Dr. Bosch will have to have an early retirement... from this lovely planet. Along with his miserable wife and stupid kid. All of them! Okay, Vaughan? Right, so we kill the doctor... ...and his wife... ...and the kid? Is that right? Yes, you kill them all. Good. Don't let me down. Go now before he tells anyone else. Before anyone knows. When that is done, we will go to a safe place. And while the sick masses die in a triumphant orgy of mutilation and depravity and death, we will plan the future of the world! Hex's world! Planet Hex! Oh, it'll be a fucking riot! Well? What are you doing standing there? Go kill the fucks! You see, the problem is the unstable structure of the core molecule... It's quite amazing, really. The speed and ferocity of the cellular metamorphosis is something I've never read about in all my life. Absolutely amazing. And Dr. Hex is so pleased! He says it's a miracle I discovered this before the launch. And he's given me a substantial pay increase. Which means you and I and Brian can leave the city and go and live on one of the reservations Oh, that's fantastic! I'm so proud of you. Oh, there's the doorbell. It could be Brian I'll go and answer it, but I'll leave you to tell him the good news. Brian will be so happy! Good God! Leave my wife alone! Good evening and welcome to your death. Leave her alone! I don't think you should have been so nosey! Please... Doc! Oh no! Surprise! - Hold the hammer. - Thanks! Now hold him. Stay still, sonny! Right. Let's see how tough his skull is. Oh, that's nice. Say goodbye, son! Brian Bosch, the young innocent, survives the brutal attack. However... inside of his head rests a piece of metal. Drill metal. The metal causes madness. The metal rots his brain and now he has CHANGED! DRILLBIT Haunted by disjointed images of the lost past, nightmare visions of extreme violence, his very soul was undergoing an agonising change. His only goal: revenge. At any cost. His target: Dr. Hex whose drug SEROCAINE would soon cause devastation beyond belief. There's a space missing... ...in...up here. No feelings. I remember...I... I try and remember... those thoughts. Like love...and caring...but... but...they're not there. Tara... I have changed. Brian, no, you haven't. You still remember me, you remember our love. You can love me again like I still love you. No! No, Tara. Do you see? I'm not the same person. I'm not...Brian. Brian died. Don't you see? I... This... fucking thing in my brain... tells me to kill. To revenge. And I don't know anything else. No, Tara. Go. Go on, leave me. Find someone who can feel for you. Brian, I don't want anybody else. I want you. No! I am not Brian. I'm this thing! I am this drillbit! Medical news: today marks the first anniversary of the release of SEROCAINE. The drug that cures AIDS and related viruses. Reports point to remarkable success rates in all users. The creator of the wonder drug, Dr. Hex, is reported to be over the moon with the public's response. And tonight, all over the country, people are celebrating a year... of SEROCAINE. Rushing, man! Sweet! Pukka, nice one! Ruuuuuuuush! Dr. Hex, the news is coming through: the mutations have started on Thameside. On gut-striven streets necrophiliac biker gangs enforce their own brutally perverted and inhumane justice. Twisted by uncontrollable rage. Driven to abominable acts of slaughter and atrocity. I love you loads, baby. Don't decompose on me! Come on the, you fuckers! Fuck off! Fuck off! Come on! You bastards! Fuckers! You bastards! Come on! Alright? This looks a good place, but it's a bad part of town. There're gonna be ape-fuckers about. We're looking for food, we're looking for things to fuck. If we don't find anything to fuck, who's first? Well, not fucking me again! Raymond, man, it's your fucking turn. It's fucking not! It's always my turn. Don't you fucking argue! You wanna be in this gang? You want the protection that we give you? You do what I say! Yeah, do what he says, right? Don't fuck with him or you fuck with all of us, right? This film will take you over the edge...and further. A savage trip into humanity's bleak future. Anybody home? Anybody to fuck here? Fuck you in the face! Do what I fucking say! Ugly is the depraved and awful disgusting future, where violence is the only language. Feel the steel! Let's fucking do it! Hex has the streets filled with biker gangs after my blood! To get to him, I need help to get the bikers and mutants off my back! There's no law up there on the streets. Only death and mutilation. We are the law. We are the future and we must fight on their terms! No forgiveness! No mercy! We must spill a lot of blood! To ensure that future generations are given a life... we...never had. Help me! Because either you kill... or you die! Hideous mutations in a nightmarish world of screaming terror! - Joe, get back! - Get out the way! Move! Joe! No! Please help me! Help me! Do something! No, Sam, come back! Sam! Sam! Sam, lookout! Sam! Christ! Sam! No, please! No, please! Please, no! Please, no! Ape-mutants with a ravenous craving for blood seek out and kill all the non-infected. Fucking love it! The SEROCAINE fuckers are coming! Will we kill a few? Alright then, kill a few but save two of them. Come on! Come on you fuckers! - We got one! - Alright... Die, motherfucker! Don't worry, I've got it covered! Fuck! And her! Do her, Joe! - Who is it? - Louis sent me. Yeah, let him in. Okay. And so...the one eyed freak has finally arrived. Come on then, you fucker!

Is he the saviour of the world? Or a sadistic killing machine, with the force of a ten-tonne tank? Yeah, right, we'll fucking take his other eye out! Definitely! Drillbit. His brutality is legendary. No-one can stand in his way. Drillbit: when the bad meet the badder. No matter how bad it gets. It can only get worse! An orgy of blood-letting which is incomprehensible... to those with weak minds. Drillbit. He knows how to party. Yeah! I'm fucking ready for you! Come on! Come on you bastards! I fucking love it! I fucking love it! Come on! It's all in a day's fucking work for me!
