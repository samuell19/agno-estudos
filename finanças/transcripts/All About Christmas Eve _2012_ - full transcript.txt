Great party. Oh, thank you so much. Well? I told you that a Christmas-themed bar mitzvah would never work. Just look at this disaster. ♪ [CONTINUES] I'm going to have to decide how to properly punish you. I can assure you that it will never happen again. Good, because if you keep this up, there'll be bigger things on your plate. Hug rule. Table four would like to know if their wassail is kosher. You can tell that it is. Okay. Will you excuse me? I have to go do some of my trademark obsessing and compulsing that you've learned to love and admire about me. Obsess and compulse away. We'll continue this in my office tomorrow morning. Nice work, Wright. Thank you. Wait, so the Dragon Lady actually gave you props? You have no idea how lucky you are that you work for yourself. Lucky? Okay, my boss makes me work long hours, overtime every night. She never gives me a raise, plus I've got to find an artist to do the bar's Christmas mural. It just never ends. I think I'm gonna head home. We've paid enough homage to my little triumph today. No way. You're about to ditch me for ten days in Vermont with your hipster prince. This is our night. Fifteen minutes. Twenty. [LAUGHS] Fine, but you owe me. What you drinking? Oh, it's a little embarrassing, actually. Couldn't be more embarrassing than a pineapple daiquiri. Hey, back off, okay? That's like my favorite drink in the world. Cheers. I see you've already passed my man-of-taste- and-refinement test, not to mention you're so clearly comfortable with your manhood. Wow. Five minutes, we're already talking about my manhood? [CHUCKLES] You're bad. I've been called that and many other things, but my friends call me Aidan. Eve. How about a refill? You look thirsty. What are you doing? I put myself through college behind a bar. So, what do you do? No, wait, don't tell me. Let me guess. Uh... Artist. Artist, huh? Or female professional golfer. That was my second guess. I actually was the captain of the mini golf team in high school. I did go to art school, though. Aha! In the real world, I'm an event planner. Hmm. I actually just came back from a Christmas-themed bar mitzvah. Go figure. That's quite an interesting combination. What do you do for a living? You mean other than whip up girly drinks for complete strangers? Besides that. Tech stuff. I'm actually in town meeting with some venture capitalists. How long are you staying? Out first thing in the morning, unfortunately. Hmm. You know what? I'm gonna let you get back to your friend before she gets the wrong idea. Yeah, I'll probably go home. Gonna watch It's a Wonderful Life and hit the sack. Well, it was very nice meeting you, Eve. It was nice meeting you, too. And if you ever have any party planning needs in the greater New York Metro area, you should give me a call. Absolutely. Well, well, well! I cannot leave you alone for one minute. I have a boyfriend, remember? Funny, I didn't hear you mention that to him. He's leaving tomorrow. I'm probably never gonna see him again. Mm-hmm. Mmm! Just like that, okay, bud? Heard the bar mitzvah went okay. You'd probably tell Michelangelo he just did okay with the Sistine Chapel, too, wouldn't you? Heard the news? You finally got a mail order bride? No. Buzz at the water cooler is Elizabeth is planning some sort of big announcement. Such as? Opening an office in Los Angeles. Really? Question is, which talented up-and-coming protégé is she going to get to run it? I don't know, Matt. You? I'll put in a good word for you if you want to come work for me. What would I do without you? I need you. Now. Right away, Ms. Cole. No. Wright. Come. You've heard of a company called Gobble? Yes, of course, the next generation social network. Well, they are throwing a no-expense-spared Christmas Eve party with the hopes of attracting some important investors before their official relaunch. Guess who they want to plan it. No expenses spared, huh? This account can propel us past our annual target. If we do it right, we can own half of the tech sector next Christmas. Well... You know things have been tight. We need to meet our quarterly goals if we want to expand, Wright. Wait a minute. This says that they're based in Los Angeles. Beverly Hills, to be specific. I can't go to Los Angeles. I have my trip. I told you about my trip. The CEO of Gobble requested you personally. That's ridiculous. I don't know who the CEO of Gobble is. Aidan Green, this is Ms. Wright. Ms. Right, huh? Wright with a W. Well, I've heard fantastic things about your work, Ms. Wright with a W. My friend says your Christmas-themed bar mitzvah was amazing. Clearly your friend has very good taste. Three years ago I'm having lunch at this bistro on 38th Street at my wit's end, trying to plan this impossible book launch, when here comes this starving artist out of the blue, just hands me a sketch. Just went for it, huh? Hired her on the spot. My first and only impulsive move in 17 years of owning a company. Very impressive. Your event is in excellent hands. Oh, um, I'm so flattered that your friend recommended me so highly, but I'm actually unavailable. Mr. Green, would you mind if I had a moment alone with Ms. Wright? Yeah. I'll wait right outside. May I remind you that, at the moment, you are still in my good graces. So I suggest you choose your next words very carefully. I just... I can't do it. Darren's taking me to Vermont for Christmas. Have I not made it clear how important this is to the future of my company? No, you have. Christmas happens every year. This account... only happens once. But I suppose I could get Matt to run point. It certainly would give him a boost in running my new west coast office. It's a shame. I really thought it was gonna be you. Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. Smart girl. Would you ask Mr. Green to join us again, please? Excellent news, Mr. Green. Eve will be able to plan your event after all. Ah, that is fantastic. You"re really helping me out of a bind here. I can"t tell you what a relief this is. Don"t worry. Your party will be the must-see event of the year. Won"t it, Wright? It will be spectacular. Great. Well, I have a plane to catch, but I will see you in Los Angeles tomorrow. I"m looking forward to it. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Wright. Mr. Green. Elizabeth. I suggest you go home and pack. This is gonna be the most important two weeks of your life. Yes, ma'am. And you will need help. I'll send Matt. That would be great. Hey. Hola. Picked up some dinner. Just put it on the table. I'll get some when I'm done with this level. I got some kinda big news today. Darren? Huh? Oh. Yeah? Hey, what's up? So, you know how I'm always trying to get my boss to notice me at work? Yeah. We signed Gobble as an account today. Wow. That's... That's like huge. Yeah. They want this like super big Christmas Eve party, and they want it planned kinda quickly. That's... That's awesome, baby. I'm... I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Could you grab me some of that Chinese? Smells great. Um, so the party's in LA. I leave tomorrow. For how long? Till Christmas. [VIDEO GAME GUNFIRE] [SHOUTS] But we go to Vermont on the 19th. I was thinking that maybe we could go to Vermont for New Year's. I promised Andy I'd go to Atlantic City. We've had this planned for months. This is kind of a big deal for me. And I'm not? But this trip could be my big break. We could finally afford to buy a place. So you're choosing work over me. No, of course not. I don't have a BFA in studio art from NYU like you, but I know what making a choice is. I promise to make it up to you when I get back. Hey, maybe you should still go on the trip. It could be kinda relaxing. I do have a buddy that would like to go skiing. And a little time apart could be good for us, you know? I'll make the best of it. For you, okay? Thank you. Mwah!

I missed my flight to LA this morning, and I have a really important business meeting this afternoon. Let me see what I can do, okay? Thank you so much. Sorry, there's a major storm in the Midwest, and all of our flights are delayed. I can get you on a five o'clock that'll get you into LAX at... 7:30 Pacific time. [BUZZING] I'm sorry. It's the next flight out. Excuse me. Wright? Are you still in the airport? I thought you'd be on the plane by now. Was it delayed? Actually, I missed my flight. Excuse me? My alarm didn't go off this morning, and then I had trouble getting a cab, and I broke my heel on the way to the gate. Shh, shh, calm down. Everything's gonna be okay. It is? Yes. I've been taking this new yoga class that focuses on inner peace, so... deep breaths. Okay. Deep breaths. Okay, okay, okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm going to drop my three New York holiday projects, cancel my trip to Aspen, charter my friend's Cessna to get me to Los Angeles later today so I can save what's left of the Gobble account, along with my company's reputation. I don't understand. No, you don't. Otherwise, you would've made that flight. You would've hired a car to get you to the airport. You would have gotten there three hours early. Clearly I misjudged you, Wright. Look, I'm gonna just take a later flight today, and I'll there in time to have drinks with the client. Life does not wait for missed flights, at least not on my team. Now I suggest you use whatever money you have left to take a bus home and hope your parents can use your help in that bookstore of theirs.

Enjoy yourself, but bring your "A" game to the meeting today and every other day. When I "m not there, you" re me. Remember that. I took the liberty of sending over some more appropriate attire. "Warmest regards, Elizabeth." Evelyn Wright, welcome to the big time. This is it. I"m not going back to New York. I"m just gonna stay right here. May I help you? Evelyn Wright and Matt Hamilton for Aidan Green. Hey! Glad you both made it safely. Welcome to Gobble. It's a beautiful building. Thank you. I like the scooter. Oh. Gets great mileage. This is my project assistant Matt Hamilton. Like the pitcher? The Rangers? Of course. Yeah, I love baseball. Well, let me show you around. You don't know anything about baseball, do you? That's not true. What city do the Rangers play for? Cincinnati. It means a lot to me that you guys got out here so fast. Like Elizabeth said, we make it happen for our clients no matter what. While you're here, you're going to meet my rainmaker Tino Costa. Thanks to him, we're gearing up for a major relaunch of the site in the first quarter. Not to add any extra pressure, but this Christmas Eve party is our last chance to attract some serious investor attention, so it better be pretty amazing. Well, lucky for you, "pretty amazing" happens to be our specialty. That should be your slogan. It's pretty good. Actually, it's "pretty amazing." Well, I know it's a little last-minute, but Tino's assembled a guest list of 300 heavy-hitters, and we're going to have it at the old Hugo Sable estate. Hugo Sable, the movie star? Wait'll you see it, It's great. So I'm guessing you'll want some kind of live entertainment. I'll put together a roster of some available talent. And then I'm just seeing a really solid visual thing, something that really ties everything all together. I got as far as the DJ and a chocolate fountain and realized I needed help. We can have a chocolate fountain, too, if you'd like. She is good. Oh, yeah. ♪ [LOUNGE MUSIC] Men. W-W-Wait. Hold up. You're saying that he had that little tramp in your bed? Mm-hmm. She was mostly little, except for her big, fake... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yours are more natural. Thank you, sweetie. I'm just giving up on men. They're not even worth the trouble. Now, don't talk like that. Not all men are dogs. Really? Really. Really. Honey, look, you are way too young and pretty and smart to just be giving up. And I totally agree. Cheer up. I'm absolutely certain things are gonna get better. Good night. Good night. Good night. I just feel like I wasted two years of my life. And I was ready to put on the white dress for this guy, you know? And the craziest part is that I probably would have if I hadn't have missed that flight. Fate can be a powerful drug, baby girl. Oh, sweetie. Why can't I find one nice guy? Like just one guy who's not gonna wring my heart out like a ShamWow. Trust me. This is for the best. You were way too good for that d-bag. This is a sign. A sign? What sign, yield? You know, maybe it would be easier for me to find a guy if I had a job or if I had just even a shred of self respect. Stop it. You are the nicest, smartest, prettiest and coolest girl I have ever known. Preach. Preach. The best things are yet to come for you. All right? You're just sayin' that 'cause you have to. All right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good! Next round's on me. Okay, Lila! Yes, let's make another mess. It's gonna perk you right up. It's the holidays, Eve.

Uh, these are from a girls' trip last year. [WOLF WHISTLE] [CLICKS TONGUE] Matt. Uh... Here. So, um, as I was saying, we are designing the space to reflect the Golden Age of Los Angeles. What about the entertainment? That's the best part. We just secured Diana Degarmo from American Idol. Diana Degarmo? Unless you would prefer a DJ. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you what. I like this very much. I like the concept, I like the idea, and most of all, I like you. And I'll tell you what. You pull this off, you're gonna get offers from Facebook, from Google, from Yahoo, not to mention... Al Kim. Is he coming? Yeah. I've got him coming in from Korea on the 23rd. Evidently, he wants to find an American tech company to invest a few billion wons in. Ms. Wright, I gotta hand it to you. Excellent work. Fantastic job. Thank you. Save some time for me on that dance floor, huh? All right. My work is done here. That's Tino. Happy? Fantastic. Thank you. Thanks. Eve. Eve, hold on. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened in there. I knew that you wanted the LA account, but I didn't how far you were willing to go to get it. We are on the same team. Really? Are we? Because if you pull anything like that ever again, I will fire you with a smile, do you understand? Yeah, I understand. I'm gonna look at lighting bids in an hour. Go. Yes, ma'am. Sound just like Elizabeth. I'm sorry about what happened in there. No, no. It wasn't exactly a Kardashian tape, but... You seriously like the plan though? I love the plan. I want to marry the plan. And Tino can't stop talking about it. It's probably the bikini pictures. He was serious about getting copies of those. Why are you so nice? I built this whole company out of my parents' garage with five bucks in my pocket and a dream. I guess I just know how to appreciate hard work. Do you wanna... grab a drink tonight? [CELL PHONE BUZZING] After work? Is everything all right? Yeah, no, it's fine. Um... I should probably work. We have a long road ahead of us. Right, so rain check. Definitely. Okay. I'll see you then. Okay. Later. Bye. Worst hangover ever. Great. I can't believe I'm about to do this. Hi. You've reached Ellen and Wesley. We're not here right now so leave a message, and we'll call you back. Did you get it? Yeah, I think so. I think it's off, honey. [BEEP] Hi, Mom, it's me. Um, I know it's still like a week before Christmas, and... things just haven't really been going all that well here for me, so I was wondering if I could come spend time with you guys. Maybe you need some help in the bookstore, and I could lend a hand. Uh, call me. Love you. They said they can only do hydrangeas at that quantity. Well, Aidan specifically requested asiatic lilies. What is his deal with asiatic lilies? Does he know that's a grandma's flower? Maybe you need to think outside the flower box. They're a retailer. They use the same suppliers as most of their competitors. Call them, ask them to do something about it. If they don't, we drop them and do it ourselves. If they say no? They won't. Anything else? Catering wants to charge an additional $18 a head. Something about the fires. I don't know what that means. So what's the difference come to? 3,600. No. Get a manager on the phone, put him on hold and then get me exactly a minute later. Done. [PHONE BUZZING] Evelyn Wright. Evelyn Wright. Wow. Sounds so grown up. Hey. What's up? I was just in the car, driving to Vermont, and I wanted to say hi. There's nothing wrong with that, is there? Vermont, right. I'm kinda busy right now. Can I call you back in a little bit, maybe later tonight? Sure. Was Cole excited about the trip? Oh, yeah. Super excited. I hope our room has a hot tub. Shh. I'm on the phone. So I will talk to you later then. Drive safe. Will do. Sorry about that. Uh... [PHONE BUZZING] Darren, I told you, I'm really busy. Hello. Is this the party planner who's insisting on asiatic lilies? Yes, it is. May I ask who's speaking? My name is Garland McAdams III. I'm the customer relations specialist who's responsible for problem accounts. Well, I'm hardly think that I'm a problem account, although that might change. You know, you sound kind of sexy. Would you mind telling me what you have on right now? Excuse me? I picture you wearing a smart business suit, small diamond studded earrings, hair down around your shoulders, stylish shoes, but nothing too formal. Okay, well, first why don't you tell me what you have on right now. Ma'am? You heard me. I want to know what you have on right now. Well, I don't see what... Because I'm picturing a casual look. You know, brown sweater, navy jacket, slim fitted pants, I think you're the kind of guy who wears sneakers with his suits. Classic and understated. Expensive, but not crazy expensive. And you try just hard enough to look like you're not trying. Plus you probably ride around in one of those little scooters, too. Actually, I... Actually, um, um... I'm not wearing anything right now. That's crazy 'cause neither am I. Yup. I'm just sitting in my office, supervising, naked as the day I was born. Is that so? Am I interrupting anything? No, no. It was just a wrong number. Yeah. Me, too. Crazy, huh? So... How are things shaping up? You're gonna be blown away. Wow. And she's humble. Knock on wood. Naw. I'm sure that won't be necessary. You're gonna do great. It's kinda weird not being in New York for Christmas. I was there last year with my parents on Long Island. Well, sometimes it's good to be out of your comfort zone. I am so totally outside of my comfort zone. Good. [PHONE RINGING] You should probably get that. [RINGING CONTINUES] This is Aidan. Yeah. [DING DONG] Evelyn! What are you doing here? Honey! Hi, Mom. Oh! Wesley, get down here! Look who's home! Honey, what are you... I thought you were in California for Christmas with your job. Didn't you get my messages? Oh. I'm sorry. I still haven't gotten the hang of that voice box thingy. It's voice mail, Mom. Whatever. The world was a better place when all we had was answering machines. Wesley, where are you? So my LA trip got canceled, and I have some free time. Ellen, check out... Butter chops! [LAUGHS] I thought you were in Los Angeles. I kinda lost my job. Uh, I have some free time, so I was thinking if you guys need help at the bookstore, I could be your girl. Are you guys going somewhere? We forgot to tell you. Your father won a trip to Bermuda! Bermuda? Two-week cruise. He says he wants to rekindle the flame. TMI, Mom. Oh, what? We have needs, too. And if we didn't, you wouldn't be here. Right on. [LAUGHS] Eww. Darling! What? [TEA KETTLE WHISTLING] Honey, what about Darren? I thought you two were going to Vermont. We broke up. What? Oh, no. Sweetheart, what happened? He cheated on me. No! I'm actually okay. I just kinda wanted to spend some time at home. What now? Well, you know how your mother always wanted a sewing room. You guys turned my room into a sewing room? Only half. The other half is your father's treadmill. It's an elliptical. His doctor says his back needs strengthening. We'll be strengthening it this weekend. You guys, I'm literally right here! Honey, I'm sorry. Look, we just thought it looked like things were going so well for you. It is. It was. We have the pull-out couch. It's okay. Don't worry about it, Dad. I'll go spend a couple days with Lila in the city. It's not a big deal. Baby, I'm so sorry. Don't be. You guys go have fun. Not before a big Wright family hug. Come on. Bring it in. Let's go. Oh. Yes. Now, doesn't that feel good? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, so just let me know when the lilies arrive. [PHONE BUZZING] Evelyn Wright. I heard from Aidan that things are progressing very nicely. No, no, no! That tree goes ten feet to the left. Your other left. Thank you. I'm sorry. There's so much to do and so little time. No need to apologize. You're doing exactly what needs to be done. This party must be absolutely perfect. Well, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I really appreciate it. Thank the woman in the mirror. She's the reason you're there. Oh, can I call you back in a minute? Diana just arrived. Sure. Call me if you need anything. But remember, think perfection. Consider perfection thought. Ciao. Hi. Hi! Thank you so much for being here. Absolutely. This is gonna be fun. Yeah. And it looks great. Thank you so much. And, hey, if you're ever in New York, I would love to make this up to you somehow. I just might take you up on that. Okay. Oh, Matt, could you show Diane to her dressing room, please? Yes, right this way, Ms. Degarmo. I'll see you in a little bit. Bye. What do you think? I think I just saw Diana Degarmo in person. And I think this is gonna be the party of a lifetime. Oh. Thank goodness you're not racking up the pressure. Have you taken any time for yourself since you've been here? I've been eating, sleeping a little bit, bathing, occasionally getting to go to the bathroom. What do you think about taking a step back, have a little fun? Fun? Now? Well, I'm the client, right? Yes. So basically you have to do whatever I say. I don't have to do whatever you say. Well, as a client, I am requesting that you have some fun. What are you suggesting? I got it. Oh, no. No, it's a good one. I'm scared. Two hours, we'll have you back to all this. One hour.

And up next we have Aidan Green lining up for what is surely to be the most important putt of his storied career. Okay, there's enough pressure as it is. Think you can back off, Jim Nantz? Hey, if this doesn't work out, there's always caddy school. I might end up there anyway if your party doesn't work out. Don't you worry about me, okay? You just focus. You east coast girls are so cutthroat. Just putt. Oh, yeah. What'd I tell ya? Annoying. My turn. All right. You ready for this? I'm ready. Ahem! I'm sorry to hear about your parents. I'm 30 years old. I shouldn't be concerned if my 60-year-old parents wanna hang out with me. I think you're being a little hard on yourself. That's easy for you to say. You have it together. You know what you're doing tomorrow. Me, I'm like alone, and thanks to Elizabeth, my resume might as well be in Pig Latin. Miss that! Can you stop feeling sorry for yourself and let me putt in peace? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Oh! Thank you! Your turn. All right. You needed this more than I thought. Yeah. I'll bet you a snow cone you miss it. You know, betting on sports is frowned upon by most companies. But winning isn't. And snow cones taste so much better when somebody else buys it. Did you just wink at me? No. The battle-hardened, poised Evelyn Wright just winked at me? I had a bug in my eye. Was it a winking bug? Just hit the ball. All right. Here we go. That's what I'm talking about! Nice, nice. Wait. I have an idea. Why don't you come work for me? Lila... Just a couple days a week. It's not big money, but a go-getter like yourself could make a couple hundred a night, easy. Or I could just strip. I'll take that as a yes. Sure. Why not? Good, okay. Now, your first assignment is gonna be painting me that Christmas mural. I am your boss now, and I want you to paint me a mural on the front of that window. I haven't signed any contracts yet. Come on. You're a talented artist. I left that part of my life behind a long time ago. Maybe you shouldn't have. Maybe you should have been nurturing your God-given talent instead of wasting it inside a cubicle. Okay, fine. What the heck? I'll do it. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah! Okay. Move it, girl. You gonna let me putt? Be the ball. Gonna hit you. Hmm. Oh... You owe me a mural. It's okay. You'll get the next one. So I turned on some of my trademark Wright charm, and the guy had no choice but to let me on the plane. And what if you'd missed the plane? Elizabeth would have fired me, and I would be playing mini golf in Astoria right now with my friend Lila. So the difference between having an amazing, career-defining event and needing a soup kitchen for dinner was this last-minute dash onto a plane? Technically, although maybe that's a little oversimplified. I don't know. I'm a believer in pure destiny. Which is what? If it's meant to be, it will be. Somehow, some way. Simple as that. That sounds like the battle cry of a lazy person, not a successful executive. Do you know I played baseball in college? No. Full scholarship. I was headed to the minors. Wow. What happened? One day I was out there, I was up at the plate, had my bat in my hands and, uh, it just hit me. It's not where I belonged. So I left. In the middle of the game. The coach had a problem with that. I bet. You hungry? Wanna grab some lunch? Here? A minute ago, you're wagering for snow cones, now you're telling me you can't handle a pepperoni pizza? Oh, I can handle pepperoni pizza. Prove it. You're on. All right. Oh, he's so adorable. He is adorable. Do you have any kids? Seven. Really? I was very busy in my early twenties. Let's see there's, uh, Scott, Jackie, Darla, Alfalfa... Not funny. Buckwheat... You're terrible. No, in answer to your question, I am childless and alone. I seriously doubt the latter. That's true. I recently broke up with my long-term girlfriend a couple months ago. She said she wanted space, so I gave it to her. That sucks. I'm sorry. At the time I thought it was for the best, but lately I'm... I'm... even more sure that it was. What about you? Do you have anyone back in New York? More drinks? Uh, yeah, sure. Sure, thanks. Ohh! Oh, I am... I am so sorry. Can I help you? No, no, it's okay. Don't worry. Thank you. I'm just gonna go to the bathroom and go clean off. You can just take it off. I won't mind. I'm sure you wouldn't. What are you doing? This is crazy. You have a boyfriend. He's about to propose to you. "After losing a new client in California, Elizabeth Cole has decided to take her company in a new direction." Eve. Eve, wait up. Hey. I'm running really late. I'll walk with you. You look, uh, different. Good different or bad different? Good different. The hair, the makeup. You look the way you looked when we first met. A lot's happened. I got a job. Bike messenger. It's not great money, but it's putting takeout on the table. That's great. I'm happy for you. Oh, and before I forget... For the last month of utilities and rent. I'm sorry for not being better with that. And look, I haven't had a second go by since that day that I haven't felt disgusted with myself. Good. That makes two of us that are completely disgusted by you. I know, and you're totally justified. There's no excuse, and I'm not trying to make an excuse. But I know how big a mistake I made. And it's one that I will never make again. What do you want me to do, Darren? You want me to take you back into my life again like nothing happened? How could I do that? I'm never gonna get that image out of my mind. I know, but maybe we can make new images together. Good ones. I will literally do anything to get you back. Just name it. Can you go back in time and not cheat on me? Can you do that? I didn't think so. [PHONE BUZZING] Hi, babe. Hi. Just wanted to call and hear your voice. See how it was going. It's going. Yeah? Are you ready for the party? I hope so. How's Vermont? It's fun. We even got a room with a hot tub. That's great. I miss you. Can I ask you something? Sure. Were you gonna propose to me up there? Wow. You don't hold back. I just... I need to know. I feel like we've been together for a while now, and... you know, we should be ready to take that next step. Come on, baby, I mean, you know I love you. I love you, too. I just... I want to know that we want the same things. Come on. The water's not getting any warmer. Uh... Evie, look, just don't think too hard, okay? Of course we want things. It's just, um... I gotta run right now. I-I-I will talk to you later, okay? Okay. Bye. How long have you been standing there? Aidan. Aidan! Aidan! [LAPTOP RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUES] Wright! Why aren't you still in your suit? It's only 10:30 out there. I work better in pajamas. I trust things are still going well. By all accounts, perfectly. If I didn't know better, I'd say I've created a monster. What can I say? I learned from the best. Excuse me? I mean, I... I didn't mean it like that. I don't think that you're a monster. Of course you did. But I didn't get to where I am today by being a lapdog. Now, I don't say what I'm about to say with any frequency. But I promise I'll either deny it, blame it on wine or both. But... I'm proud of you. And in 20 years, I expect to see you exactly where I am. Wow, that's... Let me finish. Sorry. I've thought hard about your future with my company. And if you pull this off the way I know you will, the west coast office is yours. That's... really nice of you. Nice has nothing to do with it. It's about what's in the best interests of my company. And the best thing for Elizabeth Cole Events is to have Evelyn Wright running the show out west. Elizabeth, it means a lot to hear you say that. Well, this business takes a lot of sacrifice. But look at me. This Christmas, when most people are sitting at home by the fire, wiping snot off the faces of their little ones, I'll be on the red eye to Aspen, into the strong, capable hands of Hans, the best Swedish masseuse in the Western Hemisphere. Clearly, you have it all figured out. Well, we all have to decide which choices are worth it. I did what was best for me as I'm sure you will do what is best for you. I don't wanna keep you. You have work to do. Ciao. Oh, no. No. "Ciao" is mine. You can have "auf wiedersehen" or "sayonara." Au revoir? Fine, okay. You can have "au revoir." Testing 1, 2, 3. That is absolutely beautiful, Eve. That is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. What's wrong with him? He hasn't said a word all day. Oh, well. Maybe he's just nervous. Well, I don't know what you did, but you certainly did a number on him. I just want to tell him I'm sorry. You know, I'm the kind of guy who goes out there, and I ask people for money. I mean, anybody can do it. I happen to be really good at it. But Aidan, he looks at a blank computer screen, and he creates something totally original, new. Now, that is a talent that I envy. He's a good man. Mm-hmm. And since you've been here, I have never seen him happier. It's like he's suddenly excited in our company again. Now it's all gone. Good night, Ms. Wright. Good night, Tino. Hey, baby. How you holding up? Darren, I don't think things are gonna work out between us. Oh, really? I don't think our hearts have been in this for a while, and I think we might be holding each other back. Oh. Don't let me get in the way. I'll be home in a couple days. And I think it'd be better if you were gone by then. You are such a good boyfriend. Thank you. Finished? I remember you. Oh, yeah? Yes, I do. You're the girl with the broken heart. You working here now? No. I'm just helping out for the holidays. Well, you look a lot happier than the last time I saw you. That was a rough night. Oh, I hope you don't mind me asking, but I simply adore that mural in the front window, and I was wondering if you might put me in touch with the artist. Uh, it depends, I guess. Well, I run a small gallery in the village. Could you make sure and give them this? Yes, I will. Many thanks. Cheers. Bye. Did you hear that? Girl, you are going to the big time now!

I will have you know that I've already received several requests for your business card. Good. I'm glad that everyone's having a nice time. Yeah, well, you're a very lucky lady, you know. You have a job that you really love to do. Which I really love to do. A little advice. May I? Maybe you can spend a little less time with the centerpieces and maybe a little more time with our host. Yeah? Aidan... Al Kim is here, and I overheard him speaking to his assistant, saying that he thinks Gobble is about to take off. I'll say hi to him in a minute. Good. It's gonna be a very Merry Christmas, you two. Now if you'll excuse me, I noticed some models by the punch bowl that might be interested in some new hardware, if you know what I mean. How do I look? Don't answer that. I know. Um, look, I'm sorry if you feel like I led you on. I know how it works. You wanted a new client, so you turned on the charm. That's not what this was. Well, congratulations. You're gonna make your new company a lot of money. That's not what I want. None of this was what I wanted. I went to art school. I wanted to paint. I did have a boyfriend when I came here. But he's unemployed and lazy and could care less about any of this, so... Well, it sounds like he doesn't deserve you. I'm the one that doesn't deserve you. And the truth is that this is the happiest I've been in a really long time, and it has nothing to do with the job or the party. It's you. I want another chance, and not as your client. What about your boyfriend? I called him last night. It's over. Is that the truth? Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. I'd love to give a big shout-out to my girl and my sorority sister Miss Evelyn Wright! You are an amazing party planner. Thank you so much for putting this all together. [APPLAUSE] And I have a little special surprise for everyone. Hey, babe, are you out there? Oh, hey, please welcome up my honey to the stage, Mr. Ace Young. Hi! We're gonna do a special little duet for you all, so I hope you enjoy it. ♪ ["SILENT NIGHT"] Do you remember this song? It was playing when we first met. Do you wanna dance?

How long has this been going on? Look, you've got it all wrong. Long enough. Wow. At least I don't feel bad for breaking up with you anymore. Evie, can... Please, can we talk? Don't. Just don't. Can you give me one second, please? You can take that with you. No, I don't wanna talk to you! I want you to leave! Get out. I'm sorry. [DOOR CLOSES] [BEEP] Hey, it's Aidan. Why don't you ever answer your phone? You're giving a guy a complex. Um, I heard you flew back to New York. Listen, I don't know if you meant what you said, but I'm... I can't get you out of my head. Call me back. Oh, Merry Christmas. [PHONE BUZZING] Hey. [LILA] Looking out your window? It's gonna be a white Christmas after all. I, um, caught Darren with another woman in our apartment. I kicked him out. You're kidding. On Christmas morning? Yup. It's over. It wasn't really the most pleasant way to end it, but... I feel like he did me a favor by getting caught. You did what you should've done a long time ago, and I'm proud of you, girl. For real. Thanks. Now you can get with Mr. Right. Who? You know who I'm talking about. That beautiful man in LA who wants to jump your bones. I abandoned him on the most important night of his life. I'll be lucky if he doesn't sue me. Well, I saw the way he looked at you the first time you two met. No one's ever looked at me like that. See you soon, okay? Okay. Eve, is everything okay, love? Have you ever had an experience that you thought was real, but it was just a dream? Well, not since the 70s. It's Christmas. Don't you have somewhere else to be? I don't know. Maybe. [PLAYING "SILENT NIGHT"] Hey, it's, um... Aidan Green... who you left heartbroken in Los Angeles when you missed your plane. How'd you find me? Your friend the bartender. She also showed me the painting you made. Very, very nice. Thank you. What are you doing here? Well, after the party was a complete disaster... Thank you for missing it, by the way, and sending your crazy, crazy boss... I'm sorry. She fired me. I needed to to get away. And I love this city in the winter. It's perfect. You do not get that in LA. [ PLAYING SILENT NIGHT ] How impressively impulsive. Slightly out of character, but what the heck? People say amazing things happen every day in New York. Something told me I should be here. So the party didn't go well, huh? I don't know. Maybe it's for the best. I didn't want to be the next Facebook anyway. I want to be the first Gobble. I'm just sorry that we didn't have an opportunity to work together. You know, I missed that flight by about ten seconds. Seriously? Ten seconds was the difference of me being out there with you, doing the party and probably getting a big promotion. I'm a big believer that things happen for a reason. So instead of a big promotion and a fancy new client, I was supposed to lose my job, get a job bartending, show my art at a small gallery, and catch my boyfriend cheating on me. Can't forget that one. If it's meant to be. Maybe you were meant to be a great artist. Maybe you were with the wrong guy. I don't suppose I could interest you in a bite to eat, maybe a hot cocoa? A guy that drinks hot cocoa, huh? I'm just... I am... I am freezing right now! I really should've packed more layers. Come on, what do you say? You know, there's a rule about that. You did that on purpose, didn't you? Maybe.
