Occasionally, not often, heaven or destiny or both grant an ordinary person a life far from ordinary. I've found myself in uncommon places and situations and taken part in historic events. I've never been a statesman or a politician, an author or a star or a champion. This will be the life story of an ordinary man who saw much, heard much and experienced much. I was lucky. Very lucky. It's destiny. We're all subject to destiny. True, sometimes you can try to help destiny along, fix a little, push a little, but it's up to destiny, not you. How did I make it through? I don't know. Hello. -How are you? Very well. -I'm happy to see you. Likewise. You look in good shape. This is your home, that's your picture. I know, it's true. -Noah, along with all the sports legends. I always say that L'Equipe is like my apartment. How long have you been writing for the newspaper? 62 years. 62 years! Since 1953. Noah means a lot to us. He's always like a fresh breeze coming from Tel Aviv. Here are the pictures from your visit. I come here once or twice a year. They're always happy to see me because to them I'm... a novelty. How can someone work for the same newspaper for 60-something years? It's impossible. I started getting interested in boxing when I came back from the camps since I met Young Perez and I boxed... "Boxed," I boxed for my life, it's true, but I was never a great boxer. Was Perez Tunisian? -Yes. He was a champion, very famous. Perez? -Yes. -Very famous. And nobody knows what happened to him? -No. No? -No. Nobody cared, either. After all, he was a French world champion. One day I was in the editorial room with the basketball writers when I heard the boxing writers from the other room. They wanted to do a retrospective on world champion French boxers and one said: But we don't have anything on Perez. What happened to him? We know he was deported by the Nazis but no one knows what happened then. I went over to them and said: I'll tell you what happened to him... They asked me to write about him for the paper and I did. That's when I told the story of the boxers for the first time which nobody knew, nobody knew the story of the boxing team in Auschwitz. As someone who survived Auschwitz it was not because I was stronger, not because I was smarter, I survived mainly because I was lucky. More miracles happened to me than to others, that's all. Miracle after miracle. Otherwise I wouldn't have survived. On January 15th, 1943 the Germans sent me to Auschwitz. I was 16 years old, alone, parentless. We traveled for 3 days and 3 nights in outdated freight cars. The crowding was horrific. The bitter cold and deafening roar of the train wheels dulled our senses and made us numb to our surroundings. If I'd known what awaited me I'm sure I would've tried to escape. Eventually the train started to slow down. I glanced outside and saw we were approaching some kind of prison. I saw prisoners in striped uniforms doing various jobs. I had no idea that it was a camp for Jews. They took us out with kicks and blows, with rifles and dogs. They stood us on a ramp, on a platform. They separated the women from the men and the women disappeared somewhere, this was at 5 a.m., it was dark out. Freezing. And we stood there. I'd like you to meet Noah Klieger... He is the real story of triumph. 18 months ago I lost the use of my joints here. I can hardly walk, that's why they're driving me. When we came through the gate and I saw your group with two Israeli flags, I said... How many times have I seen this? Thousands of times. I've seen thousands of groups walking with flags. And every time I see people carrying an Israeli flag it's like the first time and it makes me want to cry. They took us into the camp and stripped us. The women vanished and about 650 of the men remained and they put us in a hangar. When they shut the hangar gates we realized the hangar had no roof. So we were standing outside, naked. And we stood there for 22 hours. And over those 22 hours we lost two thirds of the men who'd come in, they froze to death. The next morning two SS officers came in and one shouted: Any boxers among you? To this day I don't know why I raised my hand, I wasn't a boxer, of course. Boxing was definitely the biggest miracle that ever happened to me. Naturally, I knew nothing about boxing, I was only 16. Still, I was an aggressive kid and very strong, I had no choice. As a short Jewish boy among gentiles I got in a lot of fights and became an expert street fighter. I was born on July 31, 1926 in Strasbourg, France. My father was an author and a journalist, a great intellectual with a PhD. My mother was a housewife who loved music, dance and theater. My parents were very different from most people I knew. I don't think my mother knew that she was one of the first feminists in the world. My mother insisted that women didn't exist just to cook and raise children. When I was seven my father sent my older brother Jonathan to study at a yeshiva in England. I was too young and I moved with my parents to Belgium. "Nazi Army Invades Belgium" In 1940 I was 14 years old. Our whole lives changed when the Germans invaded Belgium. Like many other Jews and Belgians we tried to flee from the German army into France. We were sure the French army would stop them. We were wrong... We ended up in the French port city of Dunkirk. Tens of thousands of refugees lying on the beach at Dunkirk, it was like a movie. 1940, the German army outflanks the British Expeditionary Force and the besieged French army in the beach town of Dunkirk. The allied soldiers trapped on the beach manage, through a heroic effort, to rescue some 200,000 soldiers and take them across the English Channel, all before the eyes of hundreds of thousands of Belgian refugees lying on the shore and looking on in horror. I went up to a red-haired British corporal and said: I want to go with you. He looked at me and stroked my hair, he was tall, and he said: You're too young to fight. We can't take you, but don't worry, it's going to be a long war and you'll get to fight the Germans. Of course he didn't know where I'd end up. And the British didn't take civilians. Why should they take my father or my mother or the women and babies who were with us? I went back to my parents and we lay on the beach in Dunkirk for four days. We went back to Belgium, to Brussels. By then there were anti-Semitic laws and yellow patches. I wasn't going to school anymore and like all Jews we started looking for hiding places. Trying to survive. Is it that way? It's behind the church as I recall. It's the same door. They haven't changed the door. This is one of the apartments we lived in. By then they were used for hiding. I think I lived here in '41, '42, so that was 73 years ago. Not bad... For months we felt safe until we got the feeling that someone was onto us, then we moved on. If we hadn't attracted attention we would've lived out the war here. It didn't go badly. I was sure we'd make it through the war without incident. I was wrong... I'm sorry my parents aren't here to see this. In Brussels we started a Jewish underground group disguised as a scout troop. We smuggled Jewish children from Belgium into Switzerland. I was a blond, blue-eyed boy, I spoke both French and Flemish, so I was put in charge of taking the children from Brussels to French smugglers waiting in Mouscron, a border town between Belgium and France. We looked for children and teenagers and persuaded their parents to let them go with us. I did that for many months. Twice a week I'd take three or four kids to Mouscron by train. There we'd sit in a cafe, a different cafe every time so as not to attract attention, and wait for the smuggler to come pick up the kids. True, I was only 15, but I wasn't a child anymore. I really had no childhood. I went from being a child to an adult in two or three years and looking back I've always regretted not having a childhood like almost every other child in the world. But what could I do? I was born at the wrong time. These are beer-drinking towns. If you drink coffee here people look at you askance, "What's he doing, drinking coffee?" I don't like beer but I drank it anyway and waited for the smuggler. We took 260 or 270 kids across until no one else wanted to go. Then we decided to move to Switzerland as well. There were seven of us in the underground group. We split into two groups and drew straws. I was to cross the border with the first group. But then, little Maurice, the group commander, asked me to switch with him so he could go with his girlfriend who was with me in the first group. I said "no problem" and we switched. They crossed and the three of us sat and waited for the smuggler. And the smuggler didn't show up. Three Gestapo agents came and checked our papers and our papers checked out completely. And as they were about to leave one of them said: But they must be here. I realized they were onto us, someone ratted us out. He said to me: Come to the bathroom with me. I asked him: What for? What's the matter? He said: I want to see if you're a Jew. Then I knew it was all over. There was no way out. You look back on when you were 16, a boy who wanted to live, and here you are, an old man. An old man at the end of his days and you see these places, naturally it hurts. It has to hurt. It hasn't changed at all. We got off the train here. Except that the train is more modern, nothing here has changed. And... when I was here after I was arrested I'd never have believed that I'd ever come back to Mouscron. When I was caught in Mouscron my parents were in the hideout in Brussels. I lost all contact with them and I didn't know what became of them. So instead of Switzerland I ended up in Auschwitz. At dawn they took those of us who raised our hands when they asked who was a boxer to a nearby camp. There they put us in a block that looked just like a gym. You could forget for a moment that you were in the heart of a death camp. A boxing ring... sandbags, punching bags. 27 or 28 men working out. The commandant of Auschwitz III, Heinrich Schwarz, is an avid boxing fan. To amuse himself and his officers he picks out Jewish boxers from each transport and starts a boxing team in the camp. Every Sunday boxing matches are held before all the prisoners for the Nazis' entertainment. We were greeted, if I can use the term, by a prisoner who said: My name is Kurt Magatanz. I'm in charge of the boxers. You say you're boxers? Show me what you can do and woe to you if you lied. You'll go straight to the gas chamber. A boxer or boxing expert can tell from a few moves if the other is a boxer or not. A boxer always has both feet on the ground and his arms are either like this or this. There were two professional boxers among us and Sally did a few moves... To him it was absurd, and Sam did a few moves. At that moment I thought: They're going to send me to the gas chambers, I know nothing about boxing. But luckily another miracle happened, Kurt Magatanz was a total idiot because when the two boxers did their moves he said: "I gather you're all boxers. "All right, get dressed and start working out." In the corner of the gym was a short boxer working on... punching rapid-fire, like a machine gun. I'd never seen such speed. And when Kurt saw me watching him he said: Oh, you're watching him? He's a world champion. Victor "Young" Perez, a Tunisian Jew, earned the nickname "Young" when in 1931 he became the youngest world champion boxer in history before his 21st birthday. I went over and spoke to him. Like any self-respecting Frenchman he only spoke French and we spoke. And as we were talking a slightly taller boxer joined us and introduced himself: "I'm Jacko Razon." He was from Salonika. "I'm the Greek and Balkan lightweight champion." And he looked at me and said, "Are you even a boxer?" I said, "Of course not." He said, "That's very bad news. "The first time you fight "they'll realize you're no boxer and they'll send you straight to the gas chambers. "Let's do something else, "I'll join you in the ring for your first fight "and we'll stage the fight. "They'll see that you're no great boxer "but you'll pass the test. "You'll make the team." And that's just what we did. Jacko saved me from certain death and Jacko also helped match me up against men who were either lighter than me or not such great boxers so I'd get through the other fights, too. I had 22 or 23 fights and I didn't win a single one. Which makes sense, they were all much better than me, but by then I had some idea about how to box. No one cared about winning or losing, the idea was to amuse Commandant Heinrich Schwarz and his men. It was a real show. Young Perez was a great man. He worked in the camp kitchen because he was the commandant's favorite. After all, he was a world champion. He worked in the kitchen and every evening at around 6:00, after roll call, he came out with a 50-liter pot of soup, horrible soup, quickly gave everyone a liter of soup and went back. He saved hundreds of lives. And when we told him: Young, if they catch you they'll hang you, this is sabotage, he said, "No problem. "Man isn't born to help himself, "man is born to help others. "Family, friends, that's what man is born for," and he did it, too. A liter of soup, decent, nutritious soup, made the difference between life and death in a camp like Auschwitz. So when I got too sick to go on I became one of the comrades who got extra soup from Young Perez. He saved me, too, for a few months. Being on the boxing team didn't exempt me from work. I had to do various kinds of forced labor every day of the week besides training day. The Kapos didn't favor us, in fact they gave us extra burdens to prove we weren't getting special treatment. I eventually broke down. I contracted a severe lung disease, I lost 24 kg in three weeks and was on the verge of death, a walking skeleton. Luckily, my block commandant liked me and sent me to the camp infirmary. The infirmary was run by a prisoner, Jewish doctor Prof. Robert Weitz from Strasbourg, my hometown. I was hospitalized for three weeks. One day I heard shouts: Seleccion! Seleccion! Selection. I knew I was in big trouble. In came Mengele, one of his doctors, if you can call that a doctor, and Robert Weitz, the infirmary director. Mengele went like this... left or right. He didn't even say "left" or "right," why waste his breath? And I show up and of course he goes like this, left, straight to the gas chambers. I start walking and I say to myself: Noah, you're a dead man. You have nothing to lose. I turned around and stood at attention in front of Mengele. I have to say, sometimes I think about the situation, it had to be the most grotesque situation imaginable. A naked skeleton standing at attention in front of someone. I stand at attention and say at a dizzying pace: I'm still young, I can still work. He looks at me and doesn't say a word and I say: I come from Strasbourg and my father is a very famous journalist and author. What does Mengele care about my father... a famous author? But I didn't know what to say. Then he turns to Robert Weitz and says: Do you know his father? He says "of course." Weitz had no idea who my father was. Then Mengele says: Weitz... Weitz, do you want him? Weitz says to him: "If... "Herr Commandant wants to give him to me, I'd be glad to take him." He says: Fine, take him. I had... if there is such a thing, which of course there isn't, a guardian angel, then he guarded me well. He showered me with miracles. In '63 there was a doctors' convention, by then Weitz was one of France's greatest specialists, and they had a special press conference with him at Sokolov House in Tel Aviv and I sat in the front row and three or four sentences in he said to the audience: "Just a second. Excuse me, "I have to find something out." Then he looked at me and said: "Aren't you the young man from the camp "whom Mengele gave me?" He recognized me, even though then I weighed maybe 42 kg and now I weighed twice as much. He recognized me and I said yes. And we hugged and kissed. He really was a great man. I'm not the only person he saved, he saved many people. On June 6th, 1944 the allied forces invade the beach at Normandy, France and start to advance toward Germany. In January of 1945 the Germans evacuate the Auschwitz death camp, blow up the gas chambers and take the 60,000 surviving prisoners with them on a death march into Germany. I, like everyone else in Auschwitz, was sure I wouldn't survive. There were also many who gave up hope and grabbed the electric fence. Two seconds later... they were black. Totally burnt. That was easy. I put off going to the fence from day to day. I figured I could always go to the fence. I'll wait another day. On January 22nd, 1945 they marched us out of the camp. All of us French-speakers walked together, Young Perez, Alfred Nakache and many others, so we could help each other. We're a few km from Auschwitz. I don't remember this specific place but I went through many places like it. You can't imagine what it was like. I know this was here, I walked on these paths. Maybe tonight I'll dream about it, it's very likely, but just sitting here now it's hard to imagine. The Germans were fleeing. They were in trucks, cars, on horseback, and they were in a hurry so they made us walk faster than we were able. Almost all of us were skeletons by then. They simply shot anyone who couldn't keep up and left him on the road. We walked for three days on all sorts of paths and sideroads. We were given no food or drink, and people around me were dropping like flies. They let us rest for the first time and let us sleep a few hours in an abandoned camp. The next day they told us to line up again to continue the march and Young Perez was missing. Then suddenly he showed up with a big sack, bigger than himself, and he called from afar: I found bread, there's enough for all. He wanted to join us. The SS guard said: You're disrupting, wait for the last column and join the last column. Perez said to the SS man in the few words he knew in German: My comrades... And the SS man turned his back to him and said: Stay here and join the last column. Perez figured, what will he do to me? and jumped over the ditch to join us and laughed: Bread, friends, bread. The SS man was fed up. He took his machine gun and shot him. He died on the spot. Of course there's no grave, nothing remained of him. A minute or two later we were ordered to keep marching. Here, you must understand... You have to understand prisoners. They're no longer human. Firstly, they're just numbers. Secondly, to the Germans they're less than human. Lower than cockroaches. They'd step on us like they'd step on a cockroach. We had very little feeling left. The death of a prisoner, for us, was... an ordinary occurrence. Not of one, of dozens. Anyone who wasn't there can't possibly know, can't understand, can't comprehend it, you can hear about it for hours, days, read books about it, but you'll never understand. After a long, exhausting journey on foot and in a freight train we reached the Ravensbrück camp in Germany. The SS men made us build barricades and anti-tank obstacles and dig trenches. All over Europe they're celebrating the victory over the Nazis while in Germany, the Germans decide to evacuate Ravensbrück. The prisoners are ordered to set out on another death march. I decided: I'm not walking anymore. I was sure I couldn't take anymore. This is the end, and since it's the end I might as well die sitting down, why die marching down some road? And a few others said the same thing. Shells started whistling over the camp and the SS made everyone hurry, they closed the camp gate, about 100 of us stayed behind and the others left and not one of them survived that march. Day after day passed and the shells flew from both sides. Then we suddenly heard the sound of tanks. The camp gate opened and in came three officers, we didn't know who they were. We were afraid the Germans were back. One shouted to us in German: Comrades, you're free. We're the Red Army. And we wanted to run but we didn't have the strength, so we walked quickly toward them and suddenly two of them stepped aside and vomited and the third was green in the face and had tears in his eyes. We ask them: What's the matter? And he points... behind us. We turn around and don't see anything. He says again: Over there. He pointed at the piles of corpses. We were used to seeing them. It made no impression on us. We didn't notice the stench, either. We were used to it. When I realized I was free I didn't know how to react. How do you react? Now I can do whatever I want. I can eat, I can walk around, I can go back to France and look for my parents. But at first it meant nothing to me, it was an abstract concept, it seemed like it wasn't me, it was someone else. It took me a few days to get used to the fact that this is me and I'm free, I've survived it all and now I'm free. All those months in the camp when I had no food, I was always hungry, I had hallucinations and dreams. I dreamt I was sitting at the breakfast table, with coffee... I could even smell the coffee. And I'm eating two rolls with butter, with cheese, sometimes I hurried back to the block in the evening so I could lie down and dream about my rolls, about my breakfast. I ate my first breakfast with rolls when we were in the British area. That was the first time in years that I ate a decent meal. From Ravensbrück they sent me to Paris. They asked if we wanted to go by train which took 24 hours or by plane. Of course I'd never flown so I asked to go by plane. I flew in a DC-3, a Dakota, the best plane that ever flew. I didn't know what to do because when I was liberated... I found French POWs and they knew what to do, they went back to their families in France. I had no idea about my family... if there was even a family to find. I tried to locate my parents in Paris but they weren't there. From there I went to Belgium, to Brussels, in search of them. I hurried to a neighbor's house, a non-Jew, who was in the underground with my father and me. When he saw me he embraced me and through his emotion and tears asked: Have you seen your parents? They left here about half an hour ago and went to Mr. Moses' house. I understood that my parents were alive. I boarded the No. 5 streetcar and went to the third carriage where there was a balcony and a man and woman stood there and I stood a few meters away from them and after a few seconds I hear the woman whisper to the man: Isn't that our Norbert? They were my parents, we were going to the same place. And that's how I met them. My mother fainted, of course, when she realized I really was her Norbert. That's one of the most amazing stories I've ever heard even though it's about me. I couldn't believe they were still alive. How did they survive? After all, I didn't know what became of them. My father was in Auschwitz I, among other things he was in charge of manpower lists in the camps. Every day he was given forms which listed who was still alive and who wasn't and my name was among them. He erased names every day but my name always remained. First there were 45, then 32 were left, then 27. And on the day Auschwitz was evacuated there were two names left, someone else and me. So my father knew I was alive almost to the last day. He knew what became of his son. When I was in Auschwitz I said to myself: If by some miracle I should survive this hell, I'll be an active Zionist and I'll move to Palestine. I realized that if the Jews don't help themselves they have no future. The minute I was back in Belgium I started to look for ways to attain my goal. Noah arrives in France where he's recruited as a crew member of a refugee ship. On July 10th, 1947 Noah boards a refugee ship on its way to the Promised Land. The ship is named - Exodus. Not only was I part of the odyssey of the Exodus, I was even a crew member, and that was really... No one could aspire to more. The British decided to put an end to the Second Aliyah (wave of immigration). They put us on three prison ships. At the prow was an actual cage. 1,500 people on each ship. They told us: You're going to Cyprus and when we awoke in the morning we were heading back where we came from, either France or Italy. We decided to ask the 1,500 refugees what to do and their unanimous answer was: We won't disembark in France. We'll stay on board. Either they take us to Palestine or we die on board. The deputy commander of the Exodus, Micha Perry, said that the decision to stay on board would be pointless if the refugees on the other two ships disembarked. We must find a way to tell the people on at least one of the ships not to disembark. The question was how to contact the other ships that were some 300 meters away. Then an idea came to me. Why doesn't one of us fall into the water? He'll swim toward one of the ships, and since they won't leave a person to drown they'll pick him up and that way we can deliver the message. I wasn't even 21 yet, I was an ardent Zionist, I sat on the prow as if I were tanning myself, and Micha, who was in the cage, gave me a sign, and I fell back. It took a long time to reach the water because it was a 13-meter fall. I dove very deep until I started swimming back up, I surfaced and said to myself: Here, Noah, you did it. Now you're a hero. You've saved the Zionist enterprise, the Second Aliyah, the Jewish state, you'll be in the history books. Like they write about Herzl, they'll write about Noah Klieger who singlehandedly saved the whole enterprise. You're a hero, forever. I floated on my back and waited for the Ocean Vigour to stop, lower a boat and all would be well. And what happens? The Ocean Vigour doesn't stop. Not only doesn't it stop, it changes direction and sails away from me. And I'm stuck in the middle of the Mediterranean. How do I get out of this? I said: Idiot, why did you say you're a swimmer? I told some girls I was to impress them. Not only won't you be a hero, you've done nothing. You're a total failure. What will your parents say? He survived Auschwitz and ended up drowning. No one will tell them the real story, that I tried to do a heroic deed, instead, "He fell in and drowned." Then I hear a siren. I figured I was hallucinating. I lower my arms and I feel something there. The British sent a minesweeper to find me. It was a miracle that I survived. They just happened to find me. They almost ran me over. They didn't think they'd find me. "4,500 Jews Refuse to Leave Ships "for Shelter Offered by France" I was one of the few kids who, when they were asked: "What do you want to be?" said: "A journalist," and really became a journalist. I've worked at Yedioth Aharonoth since 1957. That's 58 years if I'm not mistaken. I'm a journalist, the oldest member of the editorial staff of a daily newspaper in the world. No one is older. I should be in the Guinness Book of World Records but I don't have the ambition, I'm not cut out for that. It's the greatest compliment a man can receive, being kept on when he's almost 90 since they consider him useful. That truly is flattering. My father was a great author and journalist. When he moved to Israel he had a "parliament" that met every day and he'd show them the newspaper that said "Noah Klieger," "That's my son." He was proud of me! It's incredible, all my life I was proud of him, and here he is, proud of me. My life has been a mosaic of sadness and joy, disappointments and gratification, pleasure and pride. I've lived the life I've chosen and if I had to start all over I'd choose the very same life. Except, of course, the years of horror that the Nazis gave us. But there too I was lucky because heaven or destiny or both allowed me to return from hell and start a new, fascinating life. That is... a normal life.
