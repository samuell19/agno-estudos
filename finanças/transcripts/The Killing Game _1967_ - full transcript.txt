I hate dreams. I believe in what I can touch, I'm not ashamed I'd give all the dreams and illusions in the world for a glass of great wine. Or some old leather. Or a woman's smile, or body, Or a swim in a warm and clear sea. I thought the same thing a year ago but didn't admit it. It's nice to dream. Everything is possible. People want a big orgy, instead they prefer to dream. Tell me your dreams.. I'll read your mind. I dreamt of power, luxury, money and all the pleasures of the earth. All within reach without knowing it. Yet, I held the ultimate weapon, the secret. But the occassion.. never occurred until Bob appeared. Where is he now? Right here - or lost in another galaxy? I'll never know for sure. When he stared with his wide eyes, were they empty? And Jacqueline?... Jacqueline is another story. Jacqueline...Jacqueline is the one who pretends to sleep while I'm watching her. "He buried his head in his long red hair..." "...and he whispered.." Hello? Yes - It's that bore.. - Let him come around midday. - Mr Meyrand? - Yes? - Robert Neuman.. - Come in 'Bob' to my friends. My wife... Please sit down. Mr. Meyrand, I'm very pleased to meet you. I felt I had to... after reading all your novels and serials. They're wonderful! - Oh, come on! - Yes..yes they really are wonderful. Even spectacular I'd say. I've lived all of the adventures in your books. I was spoiled when I was a kid in Neuchatel however when I reached seventeen, I got fed up. I needed to meet people from other countries, other continents so I joined the Foreign Legion. That sound familiar? Yes, Destouches in "Lost Legion", I lived all his exploits. In Indochina, the fear, the glory of combat the buddies that you make. Schmidt, the German who joined after the war - I knew him But he wasn't Schmidt, he was Schumacher - my friend. We shared the best and the worst when we were on leave with the lovely girls from Saigon. Sorry for this military talk.. We were patrolling the jungle, monkeys screaming, when suddenly a more frightening scream arose.. The Viet Cong.. ..mowing down our best men. [Renacts scene of the battle] Schumacher got hit.. I crawl over to him.. ..I say don't worry baby, I'll never let you down. I played dead...and at nightfall, I carried my friend. We gradually headed to a friendly post, we only moved at night When rations ran out we ate roots and drank stagnant swamp water I was determined... to save my buddy. But just half a day's walk from the friendly post... ..Schumacher died in my arms. And this... the only thing left of him. Mr Meyrand, it was awful.. Try to forget it, Mr. Neuman. You're right... Then I drifted to the Caribbean.. ..and like your hero, Paul Saurez from your book 'The Treasure...' I searched for sunken Spanish galleons.. I fought several revolutions in South America.. But now...now.. it's different..I'll tell you later. I do hope to see you again. ..Madam. Here's my address. I'll be in Paris a few more weeks. I wanted to write but instead I kept thinking what Curel said. Curel was my editor. "Make the masses dream" that's our motto! One of my luxuries was going to the barbers. Even when broke, I'd go to very chic ones on the Champs-?lys?es My poverty seemed easier to bear. A good scalp massage and no more worries. The barber and I were friends. We'd laugh at the fussy ones, old rich snobs.. And that day - 'You know him?' 'No' It's Neuman's son. An idle rich Swiss. His mother owns a candy factory, filthy rich! Mr. Meyrand, nice to see you again. - We must dine together - Sure, I'll call you - Sorry to bother you, dear. - Are we broke? Yes - and there isn't even anything to eat tonight. Look. Can't we sell something? - What's up? - I'm calling the Swiss for dinner. - Salmon Fum? - Lobster Thermidor - Lamb with truffles - Washed down with good red wine We hadn't had a feast like that in ages! Of course we had to bear Bob's chatter but it almost became an agreeable hum. I can't reveal my activities to you... ..or give details. It's a professional secret. I travel a lot.. I was in Bolivia last week. I like it a lot there, though the altitude tires me. Bolivian girls are delightful, but I had to be careful they tried to bump me off. But what for? That's a professional secret Mrs Meyrand ..a professional secret. Ah! Now I get it! You're a secret agent!? Please speak quietly Madam.. Next week I'm leaving again.. ? I wish I could end my days in a quiet cottage by the lake. My taste for danger is waning. Death passes by too closely to be aware of it. Haven't you seen.. that man over there watching us? We must go! Fifty others in the restaurant can see us too? Please, I have my reasons. - They've found me.. - Who's "they"? I'll tell you later, don't worry. I can fight back.. Eleonore! Eleonore! Eleonore, you won't escape from me! Eleonore! Artemis my sweet, Protect me! - Peter! - Yes, Count Galino? Eleonore, don't be afraid. Vampire's blood will spill.. Come on I love horror films, I'm staying. - It's a matter of life or death! - I don't care! This eternal race haunting the night of the living! Eleonore.. Your teeth! Your teeth! We've eluded them... It's the organisation. They have agents all over. The old lady will get me. [Together] The old lady? Yes, the old lady. She's the boss. I cannot say anymore. - Phone me. - Ok, I will. So long. - What an evening! - What an evening. Thank you Mr Curel Of course I'm working! Yes.. You can rely on me. Great! He agreed to lend 200,000 Francs! Jacqueline come here. Doesn't he look like the man from the restaurant? Don't start me on that! You're becoming like that Swiss. - What's wrong!? - Nothing, sir. - You tailing me? - No sir, are you mad? There you are. Kindly sign here. - Thank you - Goodbye Madame Lucette And they say that money isn't everything... I'd like to speak to Mr Robert Neuman please. Hello, it's Pierre Meyrand here. Hello my dear. I must see you Seems difficult now You must. I'm very busy. I'm being tailed. You must explain to me. I'm coming Come in What do you want with my son? - Your son? - Yes, my son! - What do you mean? - I'll explain Answer me! You've been seeing my son for a week - Ah, so it's you! - What do you mean? Let's make this clear Madame, it's your son who's been after me! - Don't mind him, he's ok. - Please mother You be quiet!... So, why have me tailed? If you only knew how I suffer.. Be quiet, mum. As you can see, my son is good and kind.. ..but absolutely defenceless. But why tail me? Because my son is surrounded by leeches.. Mother, stop! They take advantage of his age.. ..I try to help him and pay off the bums. I fear his new encounters and yet.. And now get out of here.. Get out! You see how he treats me? Ok, well we've said all we had to say. Wait for me! Wait for me! Pierre... May I call you Pierre? Why not? Don't drop me. Do you think I'm crazy? Pierre, I'll explain to you later. I must work now, leave me alone. Pierre I have a great idea, come with Jacqueline and work in my Swiss villa, I'll treat you both well.. Don't answer right away, think it over.. And your mother? The old lady? She'll agree! Two weeks later we left. First trip in three years.. ..it came right on time. I hope you'll like it here and you'll stay a long while. Bobby... Can you finish your soup? You think you'll stay here long? - Good night - Good night Madam Care for a game? - Good night - Good night Pierre! Pierre, no! No! There you go! - Another round? - Ok Excuse me Bob?... Have you seen my son? - Yes, he went there. - Ah, thank you! Bills. Bills. Unpaid invoices. Bills.. Dear sir, We haven't received the script nor the cartoons you'd promised despite our advance on royalties... - Trouble? - No more than usual. You leaving us? No but I must work, I'll be right back. My life has been full of deadlines with bills to pay on time The tempo has slowed up, now it's ticking again ..the bills grow bigger and bigger. With no inspiration, Love-making is my only interest I thought of cartoons.. A guy landing on a planet, a planet with women only. Stupid... No science fiction for France. - Smile a little - I'm fed up Look at the fool, while I.. What are you writing? A comic strip text. - What's it about? - I don't know yet.. Pity that I can't write, with my exciting experiences I'd write a fine novel. Stop telling me about your stories. Yes, ok.. What would you write about? I don't know. There are so many amazing tales. It started as a game... which I wanted to lead. I must first find a popular character ..a hero. Yes, that's it! Still a young man.. ..not so good looking but intelligent and strong First no one notices him but soon he is THE man from whom no one resists. He can get anything he wants ...no matter what. Madam, do you have any ideas? Me?... I don't know.. - Me, I only like love stories. - I see. A great passion. Two handsome youths.. ..a voluptuous novel. Now that I've reached..my age what matters the most is voluptuousness. Your father knew it well! What a man.. He always said to me: "Genevieve, when all is spent.. voluptuousness remains!" Voluptuousness!... Mother, please! Pierre, let's go for a boat ride. No thanks, I'll stay but you can take my wife. Oh! Poor little Freddy! Come here. He's wicked, he doesn't like you. He hates you. - Mr Meyrand.. - Call me Pierre Thank you Pierre He worried me a lot, I sense trouble ahead. - Maybe he's nervous? - Oh no, it's more serious.. My son is a bit odd and as restless as a child and he's capable of anything. - Like what, for example? Silly antics..Oh, you could be so helpful to my son Yes..you amuse him, really! Thank you madam - What time is it? - Six thirty Pierre, I want to leave. - What!? - I'm fed up - What's wrong here? - That guy scares me - But he's nice - Let's go back to Paris Now that money is no problem, that we enjoy life? - Pierre, what'll you find here? - We'll see I'm worried.. What happened? The son of a bitch!! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Bob! Bob, stop! Bob! BOB! Stop it, please! Bob! Look at this nut! Son of a bitch! That was fun wasn't it!? Don't say that it wasn't! It was fun, no? Now take me back... and slowly! - I'm sorry - That's alright I didn't mean to slap you but.. ..I don't understand. Usually you're so nice. Sometimes I'm fed up with life, I feel so lonely. Don't you have any friends? No..girlfriends? Don't play modest, I'm sure you're successful! It's true.. Women never leave me in peace. I've loved five women. One was called Flora. A dark and mean girl. Then Helene, a pretty blonde. Then Martine...Angela... and now Lisbeth. What's she like? Big... ..sweet.. ..and she adores me. She loves music too. She also has the sexiest body in the world! The most beautiful girls in Europe await you. Striptease. A whiskey please. Why, it's Pierre! Brigitte, what are you doing here? Do you sing? No, I own the place now. A rich old Swiss left it to me. Don't you miss Paris? Not much. I dash there every now and then as a tourist. - You married? - Yes I get it, that's why you like striptease? Careful now, what would Mrs Meyrand say? Do you know a Robert Neuman? - Bobby? - ..Bobby. He's our best customer. Why, do you know him too? I'm his house guest. What do you think of him? He reminds me of Americans. Yeah, he's nice like them. Sentimental and salacious! Does he like women? You kidding? That's Flora... ..he fell in love with her. Then all the others... ..he calls them Goddesses. Helene....Martine... ..Selah because she resembled Dracula's daughter. Angela... He chased them all. Gave them presents. He just wants to sleep with them. And does he succeed? First the girls tease him then, sooner or later they give in. Otherwise he turns nasty. Right now it's Lisbeth. She's been here for two weeks. Look at her. - Lisbeth - Yes, darling? Come here! What is it? I want to speak to you... seriously. Ok, I'm listening. Lisbeth, do you want to marry me? Sorry, I couldn't help it! - Say yes? - Yes..No!..I meant no! - What am I saying!? - But I'm serious. That's what's funny! Long live the newlyweds! Lisbeth, my love.. Of course, your mother will bless us we'll travel around the world and we'll have lots of children. Poor Bob, you're dreaming! - But dear, I can.. - That's enough. I've my own problems and I don't keep men. - I can earn my living - Of course, of course You'll see what I'm able to do. If one dares, money can be found.. and I'll dare.. ..what no-one in Neuchatel has dared. Now, shut up! [Genevieve to Bob] The police came because of you. Jail!...Scandal! They wouldn't listen! It was hard to fix things. - Next time, no boat. - Next time no car either! I'll never have any peace. Bobby! - What do you think? - About who? - About Bob of course. - He's nuts. My God, the bomb! We must hide it. I'm fed up being after him. I thank you. I'm Adonis Lepoutre, Ado for short. - You know who I am? - Yes, Mr. Meyrand. You often in trouble? After ten years of watching Mr. Bob, it's not bad. - Fancy a drink? - No thanks... ..I must see where he is now. See you soon. - Goodbye madam - Thank you sir, thank you Ah, you're informed too? And I own half of that bank's stock. THE KILLER... ...OF NEUCHATEL I'm beginning to get it. Will it work? - I hope so... - Calling him Bob? He isn't smart but... shouldn't be underrated. My Desire... My Desire... M.... D.... M.... D.... Michel D... ..Michel D... The Killer of Neuchatel? The Killer of Neuchatel - I like it - And you Bob? I don't know. I must read it. THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.1 Michel D was about thirty years old Tall, blond - with a magnetic glint in his eye A kind of man no one could resist Tall, blond - with a magnetic glint in his eye a kind of man no one could resist. He lived in danger travelling around the world but after a few years he felt like resting he came back to his villa by the lake. But Michel D. wasn't made for this life his boredom turned into a form of hatred. - Meaning? - Alright! The mystery Nothing like mystery to impress people. Let me continue.. Michel D. tries to win friends but finds no one of interest. This uneventful life where the great problems consisted of purchasing lawnmowers cars, washing machines made people as dull as death. They forgot friendship, love and passion Michel wanted to wake them up from a sleepy existence. That's how he committed his first murder. The choice was hard, he hated his fellow citizens Especially.. - Delachaux is ok! - Who's he? The bank manager..a shrewd.. I think the counsellor is worse. - How about killing both of them? - What? THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.2 He aimed his gun the fat man trembled. Mercilessly, Michel pulled the trigger. The banker slumped heavily. THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.3 With a blue lightning, the counsellor's head fell on the desk Blood streamed from his left ear with an unusual gurgle. Bobby, really you have such marvellous ideas. And now who should we kill? - I don't know.. - We've plenty to choose from! THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.4 Soon he realised that murder was no solution A banker replaced another banker A counsellor replaced another counsellor To materialise his hatred against society he needed the only true weapon.. ...money! He decided to hold up the Neuchatel Bank - That's impossible! - Not if you prepare the operation. - I'm sure there's a way. - How? Take it easy, I'll tell you tomorrow. I'm tired of waiting. Five years of plans, I'm fed up! Haste is risky.. I'll do it! From now on, not a word about 'the Killer', ok? - You promise?..Promise! - Yes Tell me, shall I draw the comic strip? Sure, as usual. - Is Pierre there? - No, he's working. - Rub hard.. - Won't he come? Rub harder! - Leaving already? - To see Pierre. He hates to be bothered while working. Come here, I need you. Don't move so much. - What's that? - Your portrait - May I? - Yes, you may if you sit there. Take off your glasses. Look at me. Get up. Step back a little. More...more... Spread your legs. Fold your arms. Look at me without smiling. Which do you prefer? This one - It doesn't look like me. - I think it does... ..too bad. Maybe we can use it as Michel D in the cartoon strip? Ok? Ok.. It's an old pear brandy from the estate taste it. So, Pierre... will you read us the rest? Sorry I've worked all day and I'm tired. How unfortunate.. I promise the rest soon. Well then, I guess I'll go. Good night. - What's he doing? - He's pacing around. He's sat down. Now he's back up. He's hitting his punchball! Now and then he looks up here.. He's furious! - He's furious! - You're happy, eh? Have you got a photo of that girl Lisbeth? Yes, in the pink file. You sure follow through! May I? - Did the robbery work? - What robbery? - The bank robbery? - Pierre is still writing it. But how can Michel enter the bank? Seeing as you're the artist you must know the story? He knows the alarm system I think. How? - I don't get it? - What do you see here? - Michel and a bank clerk - She helps him Why? Because he charms her.. Jacqueline...tell me where he keeps the script? That's very serious. You're asking me to betray my husband. I'm dying to know the story. Will you be careful?... And discreet? I promise. We'll go to Neuchatel for the first episode he leaves the script on his desk. - He's had it long enough. - I'm going. - Take it easy. - You hesitating? THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.6 He was emptying the safe when he sensed something Michel barely escaped As the police arrived, sirens wailing he thought he knew the traitor What a surprise! I wanted to know the rest... it's excellent! Yes..I like it a lot. I recognise your style.. your eloquence.. Your spirit... What I like in your books is their strength..their brutality.. Surprised to find me here? You know why don't you? I'm a fan of your work. A fan who snoops in my private papers! - Just for the last episode! - Of course.. If you want my private mail I can give you a pile of it! Pierre, forgive me. I should never have come. I'm leaving. No! No, you can't do that! I'm treating you as a friend and this is what I get? I won't accept it. I won't accept it, you hear! Pierre, if you leave beware! I need you, don't do it! Listen, calm down. You're a big boy. Have some water. I won't hold it against you but leave me alone. No Pierre, stay here! stay here! - What's happening? - I'll explain later.. ..get packed, we're leaving. I'll wait in the car. Pierre! Listen to me! Don't let him leave! - Leaving? - Yes, I must go back to Paris. - Mummy, please! - Be quiet.. May I speak with you? Yes mummy, yes! You wait here, it won't take long. - Want a drop? - No thank you, madam. So, my little Pierre, you're leaving? Yes, I have work to do in Paris. I must earn money. I understand... ..my little Pierre, may I ask you a delicate question? Please do madam. Sorry to be personal but how much do you make? That depends... the royalties on my novels and then the translations. For example.. "No Rest For The Dead" was a bestseller in Japan. You see Pierre, I was expecting this discussion A few year's ago I took over my late husband's factory I was forced to make important deals which gave me experience. I like straight talks. So, let's talk straight please. But madam, that's what I'm doing! - Here's your income. - I'm sorry but.. Come and sit Pierre. You earn about 2500 Francs a month. 3000 during fat months. You're full of debts. Don't say you're dying to return to Paris. But this vacation has to end. Why a vacation? Stay here Keep writing your story, I'll pay your debts and a salary let's say double, that's 5000 Francs.. Madam, there's no reason? There is.. I'm very fond of you Pierre. That still doesn't explain the deal. Maybe your influence on Bob is good. Don't be surprised, you worked hard... To obtain this result, you help him to dream at home he doesn't seek escapism elsewhere, which was costing me far more. So you see, this deal is good for both. And opportunity strikes..but once. Do you accept? Yes Excuse me I'm very happy. You'll have my cheque tomorrow. If you have any questions about Bob just ask. You can also ask Ado, I guess you know him? I've told him you can go tell him the news. - Are you staying? - Yes Bob I'm very happy.. Who betrayed Michel? You are stubborn! Worse than my wife.. So, who is it? It's Monique...the bank clerk. He trusted her too much. But next episode Michel gets even. Yeah, you bet he will. He must for revenge. - You going to follow him? - I must justify my salary. One goes, another comes, what did you do to Bob? We haven't seen him in a week. The bodyguard's in trouble. Are you ok Ado? Are you hurt? I'm fed up with your stories what happened this time? It's o.k. Mme Brigitte, he hates being tailed. What's his mother afraid of? That he'll lose his virginity? Get going now! - Feeling better? - Not bad sir. Bob still gives you... so much attention? Lisbeth messed up this evening. He realised what she was after. - Like all the others... - What? Mrs Neuman pays all the girls. Lisbeth told me about the hold up. Since when has he acted like that? As a kid he often took off all by himself.. If I had his money I know what I'd do First I thought like you, then I realised that it wasn't so simple. I wrote down a sentence somewhere.. Here it is... 'When a life is empty, it is difficult to fill it..." "..with money or not." Funny, I just noticed that Ado's eyes were like Bob's.. ..just like a dog's eyes resembles it's masters'. Where are you taking me? - Move! - I don't want to - Poor Bob, you've the look of a killer! - Shut up! I mean it, move.. Get undressed! No! Bob don't leave me! No! That's the fate of traitors! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.7 Michel chased the girl into the woods.. ..he found her and pushed her hard up against a tree.. She was fighting back and screaming 'No, No..I beg you!' No, no have mercy... Michel took his knife and hit the young woman twice She slumped as he struck again..and again!..and again!.. Blood was spilling all over.. ..he kicked the corpse which rolled down the slope. Then he felt peaceful and laughed with triumph and joy. - Isn't it too brutal? - No... No. She fooled him, she had to pay. I'm sure Jacqueline understands... THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.8 People were terrified and Michel was happy A dragnet was set. Cars circled his house one night Michel barely escaped through the neighbours' garden and slipped into an open window. Pierre go and work. - Your skin's different. - It's just softer dear. Michel saw a girl sleeping half-naked on the bed.. ..her long black hair covered her shoulders. The sheets wrapped her shapely legs, her mouth had an inviting smile.. - It's impossible! - Yes, that you're so lovely. - It bothers me, I feel nude. - Sketch yourself if you want to? - What should her name be? - I don't know.. Be nice. I'd like Helen.. Helen's my favourite name. As you wish. Give her bigger breasts. I see a very pure woman. Romantic and art minded. - Art minded? - Yes, she'll be a pianist. Ok, for purity she'll play the piano. But why can't she be a broad? What a surprise! What a surprise.. I'm no longer alone. How nice to be here. Helen... Helen, what a good idea. Your name fits you well. - Though one thing bothers me. - Tell me? I don't see why, on this particular drawing, she has too much chest! I quite agree! Now she's as nice as you! THE KILLER OF NEUCHATEL No.10 Helen hid Michel, she didn't ask any questions For the first time Michel met someone truly pure.. ..romantic, generous, unselfish. Helen was fascinated by this man full of hatred and love. Bob, I need a hideout for them to escape the police - Do you know one? - Yep! - Can we go? - Yep! - Bob! Wait! - We're almost there, look! It's exactly what I needed! - Do you like it? - Yes, a lot. It's funny. - I'm glad that we're alone. - Oh yeah? If you only knew my feelings, I'm so glad to have met you.. ..you're an angel. Don't exaggerate, ask me to dance. If you only knew my feelings, I'm so glad to have met you You're an... You're an angel. And this lover excites Madame? Shut up slut! Jacqueline... Pardon.. - Bob.. - Leave me alone - Bob, please? - Leave me alone I did nothing wrong, I am Pierre's wife. What? You took them? It's so nice of you. You followed me! They're really very good! You mean a lot to me too... I don't want to hurt you. Bob, let's stay friends? Get out of here. He buried his head in her dark hair and said: 'I'd like this to last forever ... and ever .. and ever' Jacqueline outdid herself, her best portrayal of joy and lust of two people in love. I felt the warm and clear water on me I felt so far away from these absurd images, with absurd words But each finds one's own joy. - What's so funny? - Nothing..nothing.. - They never part. - Yep Your comic strip is a great success.. - Why do you say that? - No reason..no reason.. I'll take you far away..far away! They'll never get us.. We'll explore new cities... new countries..unknown lands.. we'll swim in warm seas, with vibrant colours - Not saying anything? - Continue...go on, Bob. I'll love you as no one ever has I'll find you flowers... and the rarest jewels.. ..we'll have a sailboat and follow the sun - Not saying anything? - Continue...go on, Bob. Your joy will be my joy, if we go broke, I'll steal.. I'll kill for you, I'll give my life for you - Not saying anything? - Continue...go on, Bob. If you ever stop loving me... I'll kill you. - Not saying anything? - No, Bob I light the match... ..pass the flame slowly.. ...slowly.. under the cigar.. Just like that.. ..the wrapping gets warmer.. the tobacco comes to life.. The operation is very delicate. I must light evenly... ..I said evenly.. ..the tip of the cigar so that it can burn with regularity. I put it in my mouth I inhale... I inhale.. the smoke goes through me and I glide into happiness... - That's all? - Right now I'm in paradise.. - Do you want a puff? - No You're wrong, not to appreciate a good cigar. It's the beginning of wisdom... ...or senility! You're like a doddering old man believing nothing, not even your writing. - Fortunately! You avoid questions, clever... Alright...What should I say? That I'm an idealist? That I'll fight for my art? For Hindus? Or for Sacr?-Coeur? Or maybe I will, well...no.. If I'm capable one day. But we don't talk of these things, we just do them. Now, I'm catching my breath. Coasting. I sip a glass of wine.. ..I swim, make love, get a suntan. Without thinking of bills and daily worries. I live from day to day. I'm convalescing. - Then we'll see. - Some ideal! And you? Come on, tell me what you're after? Tell me, come on! That's all? Good, be nice.. ..and let me finish my cigar in peace. The smoke has calmed me... After all, it was our first fight! No, not like that Genevieve, watch. Try now You're a gifted girl! My dad said to beware of women who don't like to eat it didn't apply to Mme Neuman... She was so sensuous! Ah, Genevieve! Genevieve! We'd get along marvellously had we met before. If you were just a bit younger... Yes? What is it? It's Bob, for you. Here you go. - Hello - Hello Pierre - Yes? - I've kidnapped Jacqueline - Really! - I'm not kidding Ok, don't get back late or she'll wake me up. Listen Pierre, we won't come back at all. And don't try and catch us, you'll never succeed. I'm stronger than you all and a rebel against the establishment! Bob? Bob , where are you? Here we go again, Here we go again.. - Quiet, I'm sure he's just joking? - No, he's not, I know him.. I can tell from the tone of his voice. - Call the police? - Heavens no,I don't want any scandal! Something bothers me.. Something bothers me, I'm sure.. Number 10..number 11...number 12... Number 13, here we are... ..and they say that 13 is lucky! Michel and Helen fled, Michel mocked the police, his voice was cutting... And don't try and catch us, you'll never succeed! I'm stronger than you all! Etcetera, etcetera...he knew a hideout for the first night. Open up, open up - it's me. - Do you know this? - Yes, it's Mount Aubert.. ..he knows it well. So does Ado. Good, I'm going. I'll call you. Lights off! What are you doing? "No certainty without proof" My dear police professor from Zurich said that. No uncertainty here, they're off. Come on let's go, let's go! - Hello Genevieve? - Hello Pierre, the police just called.. ..Bob's car was found wrecked at the bottom of a ravine. And Jacqueline? - They couldn't get near it... - So was it an accident? They don't know... God it's awful, it's awful.. Where is it exactly? On the road to Bern at the 74th kilometre. There's Ado.. Your boy's been at it again! Bob and your wife were seen fleeing after ditching the car in the ravine. Give orders to watch the Jaguar dealers throughout Switzerland. - Why? - Take a look Number 16. Michel and Helen enter a Jaguar showroom. I trusted him, I knew his father! He was our best client. Mr Neuman loved cars! So, he arrived with a beautiful brunette who had gorgeous eyes too.. It must have been 10 am. We had just opened. He said that he wanted a car but he didn't know what kind. I knew that he liked sports cars, I showed him a magnificent model His mother is loaded, right? But he ignored the E-Type and pointed to the Mark 10.. ..I was surprised! He seemed nervous and sloppier than usual. I point out the car and the lady steps in. He liked it alright, he asked many questions - mileage per gallon, brakes, maximum speed. Then he turns the switch, I asked him to turn it off because of the fumes He said to her 'watch out!' The damage is frightening, I still wonder how the car resisted. - What's next in the comic strip? - Lots more for him to try. It was about 2:30 p.m when I noticed the two entering the shop. It was the man and woman from the photos. Their attitude immediately disturbed me. They both of looked worried. The man asked for single diamonds, we are cautious people by trade and it proved I was right to be cautious I was ready with my pepper blower, an old trick of my father's. The lad put an enormous pistol under my nose but he was an amateur I blew the pepper, they sneezed and ran away, I sneezed too but stayed there. Today at 5 p.m, the undersigned Paul Bertrand, Fernand Montsablon Gendarmes from Saint Blaise In our uniforms and under orders We set a roadblock for the grey Jaguar and saw it about 500 metres away We blocked the road and ordered it to stop..it didn't slow down.. We noted down the number plate, probably false.. The car - 12,000 The window - 15,000 The Jaguar 22,000 Let's hope 10,000 for the jeweller to stay silent. Mmm...59,000..at least! Plus the cop's bribe. You forgot my wife, he's such a nut that.. Pierre, I forbid you to deride my son! My darling, I'm in a small house near Rothenbourg a few kilometres from Lucerne. He's back, I must stop. Come and get me quick, I'll mail this today - Kisses, Jacqueline Wait..wait..a blue Jaguar? A man and woman, a beautiful brunette? Yes, that's right. - I waited on them two days ago - Is there a hotel in the village? No! Funny, they asked me the same question! I suggested they go to Madame Inckerman who has a guesthouse at the end of town. Alright, I'm coming, I'm coming! Pardon Madame, did you rent a room to this man and woman? Pierre! Pierre!...Pierre! - Who is that? - The killer of Neuchatel! No.20. Michel took Helen to Thun airport. Let's go home. - Did you have a nice vacation? - You're mean, Pierre. And you? Stop it... Stop it... Stop it, I beg you! So it's over? No more romance? I wanted to die...I was frightened to death for three days.. Darling, you're a big girl. I don't buy this 'kidnap'. - You liked it a bit, no? - Yes, a little.. - I hope you did it. - Never, No! So what did you do between time? - Sex is all you can think of! - You can talk! Sometimes a girl needs a flirt, a warm hand, some sweet talk, words that she believes... - She mustn't feel like a soulless body - Yes, that's it I was so scared but I don't regret it. I was a girl again, dreaming of marvels ...too deep for you. - So you're a young girl? - Yes, and why not? It's terrible... I should've married a whore. - Where's Bob? Where's Bob!? - Ado will catch him. Get changed. Jacqueline come here! Come Come Come..don't be afraid. - I love you.. - Bob, come home - Your mother's waiting.. - Yes, yes..just sit down down there. There you go, now what do you want? You betrayed me... I warned you Jacqueline. I'm going to kill you - and then myself. - No, no Bob!... - I'm going to kill you! Pierre are you here? He wanted to kill me! - Did you see him? - That way, quick. You saw how he loved me, how he wanted to kill me It was simply marvellous. Would you do the same? Yes, it won't take long. It's your son madame! He's charming..passionate.. ..but charming! A hostile mob forced Michel into the fortress of Neuchatel. Where is he? Bobby! Bobby! Go on Bobby! Go on Bobby! Hello Brigitte! My Goddesses too! Good evening! He is a Neuman alright. What a shame... ...he missed being as great as his father. You're not laughing now, eh? You're scared! Don't try to corner me, neither the cops, nor you watching. You'd love to jail me, you'll fail, I'm the strongest! Don't laugh! I can kill any one of you! Poor guy.. I wanted other things. I dreamt of a pure and beautiful life.. You're to dumb to understand. Only thing that matters.. ..is that you won't get me. You won't get me. This is my revenge. To hell with you all. Yes, you too Lisbeth... and you Angela.. ..and all my Goddesses. I dreamed of real love and got bodies. With you Jacqueline, it was worse. You didn't show up... The Neuman's son! The clown! I've had it. You'll see how a man dies! Jacqueline.. Jacqueline, my love! Mother, forgive me... I'm flying! I'm flying!!!!... Michel defyingly jumped into the void.. Bobby! Bobby! - Release him! - No, not this time Madame Neuman. He needs a rest in jail. - Go ahead - Won't you come with me? No, you go alone. You're right Morning Bob Morning Pierre, How nice of you to come. - It wasn't too hard? - Oh, no... - Your comic strip got good reviews. - Great, I'm glad. We are together again.. Madame Neuman, Jacqueline, Bob and me are beginning to form a family. Madame Neuman is happy that her son won't leave her again. Jacqueline is happy now, her dreams of virginity have gone. She's chosen security and she's chosen me. This life can go on, I'll invent new games for him but he won't live them. One day my wife will have a child. We'll call him Bob. Our friend will be moved. I like Bob... He helped me find my power and realise my hold on a reader. Readers who can only dream. Even Jacqueline! I'll write stories for them, all sorts of stories..adventures.. I'll take full advantage of it. It's only fair.. ..they love dreams, and I love life. Pierre, where's that comic strip? I've a surprise Bobby.. Jacqueline, show it to him. Look at the last page. It's a pity he kills himself. You've got to know one thing Bob. Heroes never die... TO BE CONTINUED
