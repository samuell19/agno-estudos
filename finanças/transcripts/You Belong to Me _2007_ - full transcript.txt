Jeffrey! Yeah. That's it. Jeffrey! Shh! You have to take him. I can't get anything done. Hi. Hi. Sorry. No, it's cool. I gotta go. I promised you my special pancakes. I have some work to do. Maybe next time. Stop. We could hit the cafe on the corner. Move, Max. How about Saturday? You can come over. I'm just not feeling it. We can go to your place. Look... you're a sweetheart, but I'm not-- Not what? A sweetheart. Ciao. I'm sorry. He was driving me crazy, and I need to get them proofs by noon. He's an asshole. He should be lucky to be with you. What is this? The silent treatment? I said I was sorry. He's a jerk! How do you know that? Maybe because he never invited you over. Or because he never wanted to see you outside your bedroom. Don't you think that's a little sketchy? It felt good. Come on, Jeffrey. Why tie yourself up in knots over someone who is just so wrong? Why every time I meet someone I like do you have to tell me he's not good enough? Because he's not. Are you here for the apartment? Excuse me? The apartment? Uh...is it yours? The whole building. Would you like to see it? Or not? I don't want to twist your arm. Okay. I'll see it. I suppose he's included? You do take pets, right? Only if they're well-behaved. Definitely. Max. Charmed. Gladys. No. He's Max. I'm Jeffrey. Hi, Max. Hi, Jeffrey. My son's Jeffrey, too. This floor is mine. The one for rent is upstairs. - How much is it - $1650. For a real floor thru? For a real floor thru. Imagine that. It's a small building, and the key thing for me is finding the right tenant. So far I haven't found him. What do you do? I'm an architect. Roth, Stanley. Oh...a starving architect. Great. Actually, I just made partner. You're very young to be a partner. I'm very impressed. You want anything? My last guy took off pretty quickly. That's okay, thanks. Not really my style. See that? Looks like water damage. That's old news. The previous tenant clogged the tub up and the pipe burst. But my super fixed it last year. Doesn't look so good. I'd have to check under the carpet. I'm right below you. There's never been a problem. Come look at the living room. That is nice. And this is the bathroom. I've had some young couples come by, but I don't like that. They break up, break the lease... I really need someone dependable. I'm dependable. Oh, gosh! Here, let me get that. The oven's a real workhorse. I have the same one in my apartment. I don't cook. Me neither. Oh! I guess I'm gonna have to fix that, too. I have two applications now, so if you're interested I'd make up my mind quick. Hello? Yeah. Hi. Oh, right. I'm actually here with someone right now. Good. I'll go check... I'm gonna be here until about two anyway. I want it. It's perfect. Fine. But I can't make any promises. Like I said, I've got two-- Two applications, I know. Look, I'm stable, I have good credit. I can help you with your apartment. Help around. I'll give you a deposit right now. Oh, you're sweet. - Is something wrong? - No...Nothing. I'll give you my card. Wow, that's great. Why aren't you wearing it? Let me see. It's very nice on you. You're masculine enough to pull it off. Thanks. - Here's the application. - Okay. I'll get it to you by the end of the day. Very good...Jeffrey. Hey, I thought you had a meeting. I do. What happened? I...um... I stumbled on an amazing space. What? Yeah. I was thinking... Mario could move in... You guys could live together. But that's why I live with you - so he can't move in with me. If you'd just waited till René left. Oh great! So this my fault? You need your privacy, too. You've said it three million times. I'm sorry. I just-- I feel like I need my own space. Go away. I doubt I'll get it. A lot of people want it. Leave me alone. Have you seen my wife? No. I'm Jeffrey. I just moved in. I should find her. What does she look like? She's beautiful, with long golden hair... but very delicate. You haven't seen her, have you? No...I can help you look for her. Max, stay. Hi. Easy. It's down there. Everything's labeled. Bedroom's down there. Just be careful over here of the boards on the left. Please watch the wall on the left - my right - it's fresh. No sweat, dude. Hi. This is incredible! It's not done yet-- I brought you a housewarming gift. That's nice. Shit! - I told you to watch out! - What the hell were you doing? - Ah! - It ain't that bad. Ain't that bad? Look at it. I just did this. Well, I have to say - You have better taste than my previous tenant... All the bad carpet and the ugly furniture and the crazy drapes. And then the poor thing got sick. I tried to help him the best I could. I brought some doggie treats and some people treats. Oh, and an extra set of keys to my place. I think we should swap in case either one of us gets locket out of our apartment. And you. You guys need to be more careful. He's creating a beautiful space here. Movers screw up everything. I can send the super over to fix that when he does the window. You don't have to do that. Stuart's great. It's okay. I'll do it. Okay. Well, back to work. When you have a chance, I'm gonna take you up on that offer to take a look at my place. I need new eyes. Sure. - Welcome home. - Thanks. Comin' through. Oh, I almost forgot. I called the locksmith. He's gonna be here first thing Monday morning. Is that all right? - Yeah, sure. - Good. - Excuse me. - It's okay. Thanks. Please be careful here. Hi. How's it going? Why are you here? I live here now. Here? What do you mean? Number 2. I saw the sign a while ago. This is my building. Really? I had no idea you lived here. You're in 2? Geoff moved out? Ah, yes. You're J-E-F-F, right? He's G-E-O-F-F. He lives here. You can come check. I haven't seen him. That was a joke. Oh, you've met. I was gonna introduce you. Where is Geoff? Geoff's gone. But you should see what this Jeff did with the place. He didn't say he was leaving. Where'd he go? Beats me. You should come by - check it out. No, no. I think they're all the same. - See you later. - Ciao. Ciao. Have you two met before? Uh...Not really. A friend of a friend. It's so hard. You deserve better. I do all right by myself. I'm sorry. I was just trying to be honest. Geoff! Shit. All right. I'm coming in. Geoffrey. Hello. Hey! - Geoffrey! - Can I help you? I know you're in there. What the hell! Stop it! What are you doing? Who the hell are you? Come on. Let's go. Let's get you up. That's Geoffrey's ring! You took it! Where is he? Why'd you take it?! If you want it, you can have it. I found it when I moved in. I really didn't know it was his. Where's my Geoffrey? I want my Geoffrey. Stop it! Ouch! Fuck! Jeffrey, are you all right? I'll make it better. Get off him! What happened? Let me see that. I've never seen him before. He has a set of keys. I didn't mean to. I just want to see Geoffrey. Where's my Geoffrey? I don't know! Ask her! This is all my fault. Let me take care of this, all right? Michael, sweetie. He doesn't know that Geoffrey. Come downstairs with me and have a little tea and I'll tell you the whole story. Okay? You'll be OK? Yes. Sorry. I said I'm sorry. Hello? Hello? Max! Shh! Hi. How's your new dream palace? It's coming along. Well, can I see it? C'mon. Here...so you don't forget me. Please. Yes, I know. I shouldn't have. But I did. Thank you. What happened to your face? Oh...long story. What are you doing? Just working on a few things. Why didn't you do it before? Because I wanted to move in here. We need to eat this. What is it? The sweetest stuff you'll ever have. How'd you get in, anyway? This guy let me in - Handsome, dark hair, blue eyes... I almost went to his place. René. The guy you walked in on me with. Remember? Are you serious? He lives here? Is something going on? Not yet. Hey, there's chocolate sauce in the fridge, if you want it. Okay. What's wrong? A man at the window! What? Call the police! Jeffrey, call the police! I'm not gonna call the police. Nicki, put the knife down. No! There was a man at your window. What was he doing? - He was looking! - He was looking? He was looking! Shit! Max, stop eating that. Get away from that. Stop it! I'll get it. Hello. Can I help you? Is Jeffrey here? Hold on. - Hi. - Hi. Stuart thinks he might have scared you... The super. - That was Stuart? - That was Stuart. I'm Gladys. This is my building. I'm Nicki. I'm his friend. It's nice to meet you. He said he wanted to fix the window. So I said, well, I think you'd better ask him before you do that. But, you know, he's so methodical and he hates to leave things undone. So...are you guys okay? Yeah, we're fine. It just startled us. I felt bad so I thought I'd bring a little peace offering. Oh, you didn't have to do that. It's nothing. I made so much I just thought I'd bring you some. I made some nice pork tenderloin, and some haricots verts, and a little Georgia peach pie. Did you cook this? Well, me and the microwave. Would you like some? No, thanks. Here, Jeffrey, try this. So are you a partner, too? Huh? In the firm? Are you an architect? No way. - It's good. - I'm glad you like it. I've been asking Jeffrey to look at my place, but he's too busy for me. He's brushing me off. - That's not true! - He's always too busy. You're the one who has the boyfriend. Barely. You can never hang out any weekend. - You always go away. - Oh, please! - You said you were going away. - I had to work. Last weekend, this weekend. Okay, I'll leave you two to your fun. Enjoy this. And I'm really, really sorry about Stuart. No problem. Nice to meet you, Nicki. You too, Gladys. Last weekend, you said you couldn't, and then this weekend-- I had to work. Anyway...you told her you made partner? I really wanted the place. She's a piece of work. She's okay. She means well. And she didn't have to give me the place. She had two applicants. Yeah, you're right. Come here. Does it taste good? Really good? Have some. - No. - Really, it's good. I wanted ice cream. Fine. Hi. Hi. Is René-- Is Rene here? Sure. René, it's for you. Hi, Jeffrey. Hi. I brought you a reverse housewarming present. Have you met my boyfriend, Robert? Jeff moved into the apartment and we met earlier in the hall. Come in. We're just having a few friends over. No, really. It's okay. Really, Robert-- No, no. Come on...join the party. This is Eduardo, Lance, the bachelor, David, the whore, and that's Alberto. You watch out for him, okay? Who wants a Pomo Cosmo? - Jeffrey! - Gladys! You have to have one. I make them with pomegranate juice instead of cranberry. Pomo...get it? He brought your favorite wine. - I'll pour you a glass. - I'll do it. Okay, gentlemen, have at it. Act fast. Everyone loves a good Margarita. Oh, sorry. Any takers? No. No, thanks. We could be friends tonight? I just need to use the bathroom. You're no fun. She's a riot. Robert can't stand her. Says before I moved in she was always lurking around-- Hey, I was wondering. How long have you been here? About a year, right? The place looks great. Can I get a tour? Let me get that. We meet again, huh? Will you excuse me for a second? Oh, hey, Jeffrey. Having fun? Yeah. Great crowd. Listen, I wanted to explain-- Jeffrey! René! No worries-- René, you're supposed to smile! Let me take one of you two. Okay, a picture of me and Jeffrey - my new tenant and my new architect. You're right - I can do better. Hello. Are you okay? Can you hear me? Gladys? - Hi. - Hi there! How's your new home coming? It's great. I was wondering if you wanted me to look at your place now? Yeah... I was thinking I want to start everything from scratch. Open it up... New color, new walls. Everything new, new, new. I saw these translucent screens in Elle Decor and I wanted to run those by you - tell me what you thought. I just have to have a better look at the space. I'm assuming it's broken up into boxes like mine. Like pure white. Clean, simple lines. I'm willing to do just about anything - open up the walls, knock down walls, whatever. Well, I'm ready when you are. I have to go somewhere right now. Maybe we can do something tomorrow. Sure. You're perfect. I knew you would be. What are you doing? Gladys wanted me to look at her place, help her rethink the space. Did you find your wife? Why? Do you know her? No. It's just last time... Well, sorry. I think Gladys mentioned her once. Excuse me. Hello? Hello? Hello. Gladys? Good. You're awake. It's okay. Here, take this. It'll make you feel better. There we go. That's a boy. Good. What are you doing up so late? I need to go home. Oh, no. What you need to do is rest. Can we talk about this in the morning? I'm fine. I just need my clothes. I need to go home. I'm washing your clothes. What? Yeah...you dirtied them. Well, you did. Jeffrey. You're not well. I need to walk Max. I walked Max. He's fine. You went into my apartment without permission. I need permission to go into your apartment, but you don't need it to go into mine? Is that really fair? - C'mon. - Don't touch me. Jeffrey. Please don't do this. Max was barking uncontrollably. You have to rest. That's all there is to it. I'll rest in my own home. Open the door. - Open it! - No. I'm sorry... but I need to go. Perfect timing. You've met Stuart, right? Stuart brought us oatmeal and eggs for a healthy morning. Thank you, Stuart. You like oatmeal, don't you? Be right back. Can you please move? Hey! Listen! Actually, he can't. He's deaf. He doesn't speak either. Well, not like you and me. He makes grunts and noises like that. He can lip-read though. He's actually quite communicative. Give me my clothes and let me go. What do you say? What? What's the magic word? Well? Please. And? Thank you. Please and thank you. Please. Thank you. I'm leaving. Hey! Let me go! What are you doing? Let go of me! I don't like this attitude, Jeffrey. We'll talk about it in the morning. Fuck you! That language is unacceptable. Come. What is this?! Gladys, open it! Dammit! Let me out! Help! Help me! Gladys! Let me out! Good morning. Time to get up. I picked these out for you. I am making you a delicious breakfast, so hurry up and get dressed. It's almost ready. Jeffrey... Your breakfast is getting cold. Come sit down. Good morning. Are you ready for your oatmeal? Come here. What am I going to do with you? What are you doing? Playing hide and seek? Why's he here? Come out of there. Why? Why is he here? Look, Jeffrey. It's time for your breakfast. Fuck you! I don't want your food. There is no swearing in my home. You're upsetting him now! Me?! What'd you do to him? This is your last chance. Are you coming out or not? You're being very disrespectful. Now he's upset with me! See what you've done? Michael. Michael, what happened? Hey, baby. Michael, what happened? Are you ready to come out? Look... René's gonna STOP by this afternoon and he's gonna get suspicious if I'm not there. Don't lie to me. We both know René is not interested in you. Michael needs help! Okay? Let me out! What is wrong with you? I'm gonna... bust down the door. Well, if you try that, then you'll stay in there till supper. Ow! Fuck! Are you hungry now? If you promise to be good, I'll unlock the door and leave you your breakfast. No, it's not available. No, I have someone new. The other guy wasn't working out. Shh! Shh! Michael... Michael. Oh, my God. What are you doing?! Don't you ever stop? He's not breathing! He needs a doctor. He hurts you and this is what you do? - He's dying! - Get away from him! Hey! Jeffrey! Let go! Gladys, let me out now! What is-- Let me out! Hey! Hello! Help me! I'm in the basement! - Hello? - Help! Help me! I'm looking for Jeffrey in apartment 2. This is apartment 1. Gladys? It's Nicki. We met last week. Oh, yeah. How you doing? Can I help you? I'm in the basement! Yes. Can I come in? Sure. Welcome back. Have you seen Jeffrey today? No. When was the last time you saw him? The day before yesterday. Help me! We were supposed to get together today and he never showed up. Did he say anything to you? No-- Oh, you know what. He did. He said they were going upstate for a few days. That's right. I'm in-- René? Jeffrey said he had a new friend. What? That jerk! He was supposed to call me. Help me! I can tell him that you came by, if I see him. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Good night. Gladys! Let me out! Now! Jeffrey, you need to go to sleep. It's very late. Gladys. Let me out...now. Jeffrey, did you hear me? Gladys! Let me out!! Hi, this is Jeffrey. Please leave a message. Hey, it's Mia. We're a little concerned here. Give us a call at the office when you get in. Stop! Stop! Tell him to stop! Stuart! Slow! I'll break your fuckin' neck! Tell him! No! Make him move over there. Go there! By the wall. Slowly. Okay - slowly. No, no. We don't want to hurt you. Shut up! You're sick! Make him stop! Stuart, stop! No, Jeffrey. Please don't leave me. Jeffrey! Get him! Get him! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Hey! Hey! I need you- Oh, my God! Get off me, you freak! Good morning. What happened? You're in the hospital. I'm Maria. You need to call the police. I promise not to hurt you, okay? Do you hear what I'm saying? You have to believe me. Are you on any medication? Do you hear what I'm saying? Any dizziness? Headaches? What are you doing? Relax. This will make you feel a lot better. The medicine is gonna kick in in a few minutes. I can't thank you enough, doctor. His father and I were so worried about him. We'll do exactly what you say. What's a matter with him? He's been sick. We're bringing him home. He had an accident. We're his family. Everything's fine. He doesn't look so good. We'll, he'll be okay. There. C'mon. Upsy daisy. So you ready to get out now? Okay. Stuart. Don't pay attention to him. He's just being grumpy. All right. Let's go. Just you and me. Good night, sweetheart. Hey, are you there? Pick up. Pick up, dammit! Who's ready for breakfast in bed? Okay. Good. Sit up. That's a boy. What's wrong? - Gladys? - Yes. Why doesn't Stuart like me? Oh, don't say that. He loves you. And he's loved you right from the beginning. - No, he doesn't. - Don't say that. Don't you know how important you are to us? Look at me... Aw, angel... I'm gonna fix everything. Stuart can get very nervous sometimes. People used to think he was mentally disabled, but that's not true. He's just doesn't get along with other people. He can be gruff... but you need to give him a chance. Deep down inside he's really a tender, sweet man. You just need to get to know him. Jeffrey... I'm gonna prove to you how much he cares. - Hi. - Hi. Hey! Can I help you? - Looking for Jeffrey? - You're a genius. No need to be rude. Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Where's Jeffrey? What are you doing with Max? He's deaf. Why were you in there?! What did I just say? I don't fuckin' speak sign language! What are you doing with his bag? I gave him that bag! Let go of me! You're out of control, don't you think? Why didn't you help me? Come. Just relax. Here. Hold this. Be careful. Look what Stuart's done for you? I told you. I'm trying to keep this family together. I know you care about me... but he doesn't. Please don't say that anymore. He does. He doesn't. I can see it. He does. We are a real family here. Come sit down, please. - I'll take Max then. - No! Then let's go. That's it for today. If he's not back by tomorrow, we call the police. Okay? Shit! Why did you do that? Watch out for glass. There is a problem with the floor. A real man's breakfast. Will you cut mine for me, please? Oh sure, honey. Here you go. Oh, no, no. That's people food. Max needs to eat, too. Enough! Stop it! That's the door. Gladys! Where is he? Who? Jeffrey? Where is he? That idiot has his bag and Max. Jeffrey asked us to watch Max while he was away and he gave us the bag for his food. Bullshit! Would you like to come in? No, thanks. Enough drama for today. See you later. Jeffrey would never put Max's food in that bag. Jeffrey! Jeffrey, where are you? How do you know he wouldn't put food in that bag? Because I'm his best friend and I know that bag's special to him. Who are you? I'm his mother, and I'm more special to him than you, I think. Please! Just tell me where he is. Gladys? Gladys? Here. This is for you now. Take it. My Jeffrey ran away from me. He never called me. I begged him to come home - I begged him. And he wouldn't. He came home when he got sick though. He came home to die. You won't die. I won't let you. You can't take care of yourself. You come home night after night with a different man. Your life is empty. Shut up! I saved you... I gave you that apartment. I nursed you back to health. You can't leave me. You can't leave me! No! Don't! No...No! Enough! Help me! Stuart's gone. Don't be afraid. It's just us now. It's just us. Jeffrey! Nicki?! Jeffrey, where are you? Nicki?! Jeffrey! No! Jeffrey! Don't leave me. Are you there, Jeffrey? Jeffrey? I'm here.
