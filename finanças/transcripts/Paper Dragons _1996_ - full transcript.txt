(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) - (groaning) Please! (groaning) (thudding) Ah, wait, ah no no! (groaning) - See you in hell, (stammers) fucker! (thudding) (peaceful music) - It'll work, man. We can do it. - We rip off Tank's supplier, we'll have half of China after us. - We'll be in an airplane before they even knew what hit 'em. They won't know it's us, we can do it. (upbeat R&B music) - Too dangerous. - It's not too dangerous. I know exactly, I know when and where the drop takes place. We can do it. It's a peace of cake. - He's right, you guys should be fine. I mean, we can just take it. (laughs) (snorting) - I'm a businessman, not a thief. (giggling) How do you know where that went, man? - We weren't. Look, now we are. Let's just give it a shot. Yeah. Beats playing the game by their rules. - You know, the coke is going to your brain. You're not thinking. - Come on. Gotta try it. Gotta get off your high horse and join the high life. - No no no no. - And I'll be driving the car. - I'm allergic to this stuff. - No, you're not allergic This shit's the best, man. Come on, try it. Come on, look. Look at that. (sneezing) (laughing) (smacks lips) (laughing) (peaceful Chinese music) (laughing) - Oh man, we're cooking now. (laughs) Oh, I love it, I truly love it. Ah, thank you, sweetie. You sure you ain't gonna eat nothing? - Nah nah, Sammy we gotta go. - Yeah Sammy, we have a meeting to go to. So, uh, you, we'll bring the stuff. - Man, don't rush me. I'm trying to eat my motherfucking fries, alright? Got the best damn fries this side of Idaho. You want some? - No man. Some other time. Paul's right, though. We gotta go. - Shit, you gotta go, you gotta go. - I'll have some. - You can have all you want, sugar. Something for your boys. Two nines with sneakers, that's what you asked for, right? Sammy delivers. - That you do, Sammy. That you do. We owe you, man. - You goddamn right. You know how hard it is to pick up that shit at the lat minute? Mmm? Hey hey hey, don't forget the tip. (laughing) - [Jack] Yeah. - That fool grab a coat. (laughs) (peaceful Chinese music) (gun firing) (shouting) - Alright, nobody move, nobody fucking move! (gun firing) I said nobody move! - What the fuck did you do that for? - Well, he fucking moved! - Jesus, you're a maniac, man! - Get the fucking briefcase! - Give it to me. - Do you know who this is for? You're dead men! We'll find you and tear you apart. (laughing) - You're absolutely right. (gun firing) (gun firing) - Jesus, holy shit! You killed three people! Shit man, you killed them all, dead! That's not the way it's supposed to go down! - So I ad-libbed, so what? Do you wanna stand here and argue about it, or do you wanna split? - That's it, man! You are a maniac! - Pick up the fucking briefcase and let's get out of here! - No! - Pick up the fucking-- - Hey hey hey hey! (shouting) (guns firing) - Go man, go man, go go go go! (gun firing) (peaceful Chinese music) (dramatic music sting) We have enough here to set up shop in Lum for six months without having to make a buy. - That's all you can think about? You lost your mind! - [Jack] What's your problem, man? - My problem, we killed people! Kate, we killed them all! Kate, Kate, can you believe it? - That's nice, be a good boy, nice. - Nice, nice! Nice, fuck! We killed three people and she says nice! - Well that's not entirely true. I killed three people; you watched. - Oh yeah? I'm just as guilty as you are. - So what? They're drug dealers, they're scumbags! (laughs) - What are we? - [Jack] We're expanding, baby! (peaceful Chinese music) (dramatic music) - Don't move. Death and taxes. - [Greg] Time to pay up. (chanting in a foreign language) (peaceful Chinese music) - Get the fuck in the car. You ripped off the wrong guys! They (stutters) pay us plenty to make sure this kind of shit don't happen. - You made us look bad, baby. Big fucking mistake. - Oh. - He was a talky little (stutters) fuck for the first 20 minutes. (laughing) - I don't think that one's necessary. Just make this one deeper, like this. There, that's enough. Just relax, relax. (water trickling) (birds chirping) (fists thudding) (gasping) (grunting) (heavy breathing) - Who are you? - Drink this. - No, no, who are you? - I'm Master Tsai of the Yung Dao monastery, drink. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Ow, I need a doctor! - You don't need a doctor, drink this. - I need a hospital. (groans) (sighing) - [Chang] Is he awake? - He was, for a short while. Tell me when he can talk again. - You wanted to see us? - You wanted to see us? - Sit. - That man you killed. They found him today. What's wrong with that statement? - I'm not following you? - One man was found in a shallow ravine yesterday. One man. Where's the other one? - Search me, we killed them (stutters) both. - Maybe the coyotes dragged one of them off. - A full grown man. - What? - A full grown man! - What! - A full grown man! - Hey, there's all kinds of things roaming around those hills. Anything could've eaten him! - I want details! I want proof that the pieces of shit that dishonored me and killed my men are dead! Do this or you will find yourself being fed to the coyotes. Do we have an understanding? - Yes sir. - I hear you. - Do it now! - (groans) Caucasians. (car engine humming) (gong ringing) - Who's in charge? - Master Chang is in charge. - Well go and get him. Go and get him! Go and get him! - I will, I will. (groans) - Come on, (stammers) hop to it! - Hey man, check this shit out. - (stammers) What are you doing? - [Monk] Two men came up. - Okay, I'll take care of all of it. (murmurs) What can I do for you? - We're looking for this man, Paul Marcos. - I have not seen him. - Well if you do see him, notify us immediately, you got that? - And if you see him, notify us immediately. - What did he do? - He's a drug-dealing scumbag, okay? Is he here, or isn't he? - I told you, I've not seen him. - Well if he's here and you're not telling us, we can (stutters) book you for harboring a fugitive, you understand? - Let's go. - Hey, which one of you broke the vase? - It's a shame. - Look at that. (peaceful Chinese music) (sighs) - Where am I? - You are in good hands. We will take care of you. - How long have I been out? - Time is of no essence. - I've gotta go. I've got things to do. - Eat, slowly. - Welcome gentlemen. Please, sit, sit. This feast is for you, my friends. To celebrate the good and the bad. The good, we have food to eat. (laughing) - Food is good. - The bad is that Tang lost some drugs and some men. Fortunately, one of Tang's informants got our merchandise back. Thank you, Tang. And we killed the people who killed our people. Thank you Vincent, Greg. They clean up the mistakes that we make. Mistakes that we cannot afford to make. (laughs) Dear Tang, now I know you are a loyal member of our family. Unfortunately, loyalty is not enough! We cannot make these kind of mistakes! - [Tang] No mistakes. - We cannot! - No mistakes! - We cannot! We cannot! (grunting) (screaming) Do you fucking hear me now! Huh? Do you fucking hear me? (screaming) Do we understand, huh? (screaming) Now we can eat. - I'll just have the rice. (water trickling) (wood thudding) - Ah Paul, I see you are well. You are walking again. - Oh, you call this walking? - It's better than when I first discovered you. You were almost of another world, so be happy that you are well again. - Yeah, but I'm still fucked up. - Hmm? - You know, fucked up, hurt. Probably will never walk right again. - Good, then you shall join our training for tomorrow. - Are you crazy? No, I can't do that kung fu stuff. - Do not fear. It will make you regain your health, heal you. - You're gonna crack your nuts there, wacko. See you later. I don't think I can do this. - This is the slow form. It's called tai chi. Breathe in, deeply breathe out. Very slowly. Breathe in. Put it down, breathe out. Bring your left hand up and watch the waving clouds. Now the right hand. Once more. And let it come into you, relax. Good. (upbeat music) (singing in a foreign language) (laughing) - Paul. You are restless. - I can't do this. - Close your eyes. Let your mind go blank. Relax. Think of nothing. Let your anxiety and your anger go. (sighs) - This is bullshit. (peaceful Chinese music) - [Tsai] He's well enough. He should leave by the end of this week. - I think he should stay. - What? You want him to stay? No no, he's not Buddhist. We've never seen a man like this in our temple. - This man needs help. I think you can train him to be a useful monk. - I know he needs help, but we cannot cater to him all the time. I say he must go. He's too big a risk to our temple. - Are you referring to my other risk? - Well you know what happened last time? I don't want to mention it, but this man should go. Could create too much of a problem for us. - I say he stays. - No, I disagree. - It's not for you to say! Master Tsai! (speaking in foreign language) (thunder roaring) Hello. - Hey. - I'm told you're about ready to leave. - Yes, as soon as I get my legs back. - Where are you going? - I don't know. I'll find a place. - The police came while you were unconscious. They were looking for you. - What did you tell them? - We told them that we have not seen you. We don't know where you are. We lied for you. You owe us an explanation. - Those are the bad cops, the ones who tried to kill me. - They're very determined, and they won't stop until they find you. What did you do? - I messed with a pal of theirs. I didn't know what I was doing. - You're welcome to stay, but if you remain you have to contribute like all the other monks, committed to work and to the temple. - You mean, turn monk and shit? - You can become a monk. - Hey, I appreciate what you've done for me, but I can't become a monk. - Uh huh. You think about it. - I'll think about it. (thunder roaring) (upbeat rock music) - [Victor] It's on me! - Oh, it's my turn to pick up the check. - No no, it's my turn to pick up the check 'cause I covered you last time, and now if you-- - (stutters) No, it's my turn to buy. - It's my fucking turn! - It's my turn! - It's my fucking turn! - On the house! - What? - On the house! - Oh! - Hey! Alright! - It's on the house! - [Victor] Hey man, you look after us. - We look after you. - Come on, let's go. (groaning) - Hey hey, what the, what the fuck are you doing? - Fucking guy got in my way! - How 'bout a couple bucks? - Fuck off! - Give him some money. - What? - Give him some money. - He does look a little down on his luck, huh? (upbeat rock music) - Hey. Come here. What's your name? - My name is Liu. - Hey Liu, I'm Paul. - They said you were almost dead, but you look okay to me. - Yeah, your masters have helped me very much. What have you got there? - Rocks. - Rocks, for what? - To toughen my fingers. Try it. - No no, show me. Ouch, don't do it anymore. - You have to do this everyday. There are a lot of rules They are very strict. But I can get away with many things. - Like what? - Like food. Good food, bad good food. And sometimes, I sneak out and hunt fish in the river, too. Shh, don't tell the masters! - Oh. It'll be our secret. Okay, alright. - Let's hunt fish in the river, I hear you got a lot of them. - You must've been talking with Liu. - Oh, I'm not allowed to say. - May I ask how you came to be here. - It's complicated, you don't want to know, - We have all the time in the world. (peaceful Chinese music) - [Paul] I came to this country a while ago, after my parents got killed by the government. - [Cook] The government? - Yeah, there was a military dictatorship. My parents just disappeared. One night we were home, and the next morning, they were gone. So I was gonna be next. I came here thinking I could become a businessman. But it wasn't so easy. I couldn't find a job anywhere. - You did something bad, didn't you. - Yeah. Nobody wanted to hire a poor immigrant. So I got involved with the wrong people, worse than my own country. I did something stupid, things got out of hand, and here I am, half dead, half alive. - What do you mean? - Once I leave here, they'll find me and kill me. - So you should just stay. - And do what? - Live. Here. (peaceful Chinese music) - Paul, Paul, come on! Master Tsai's looking for us! - Ah, beautiful day, Molly. Ah! That's a good girl, keep walking Molly, keep walking. That's a good girl, good girl, good girl, Molly. Good girl, Molly. Well, hello Paul, how are you? - Good. - Feeling well today? - A little sore in my chest. - Oh there? Well, put on your hat. Let's do this. Breathe in deeply. Back, push all of it out from the bottom above your stomach. Do it again. Breathe it out. Ah. - Ow. - Good now, all clear. Four phases make up our system. (speaks foreign language) Only when the four are in harmony do we reach the fifth phase, and that is earth. This will make you very strong. - Good huh? (laughing) (laughs) (speaks foreign language) (grunting) - Have you considered what we discussed the other day? - Yeah. - And what is your answer? - I'll be leaving soon. (door slamming) (peaceful Chinese music) (heavy breathing) - Paul, are you still hungry? - I'm starved. May I have some more. - I'll get it for you. - No no no, I'll get it. - I want more, too. (monks grunting) - [Paul] Whoa, fanatics. - You see, there's nobody here. - We'll be the judge of that! - They're gonna kill me. - Don't worry, Master Chang will protect you. - [Paul] He can't protect me from those guys. - [Cook] If you stay here with us, he can. You should stay. - Let's go. - Okay. - [Cook] I don't know why, but he chose you. You should stay. (tense Chinese music) (grunting) (laughing) - Shut the fuck up. - Paul, there is no fuck here! This is a monastery! Paul, stay! Who notice what student Paul did wrong? Oh. (grunting) Those who notice him were not concentrating on their training. His concern is not yours. We are all equal here as students and still learning. Am I right? (laughing) (speaking foreign language) If you want to be certain not to make the same mistake again, talk to me privately. Wu! Give me that. Finish this chore for student Paul. - [Paul] No, I can do it. - You need your rest. Kung fu is very tough on beginners. Wu! (wood cracking) - Paul, come here! Bring some ginger. Now, the vegetables can't be steamed too long or they'll get soggy. You'll know when they're ready when they look something like this. Good, huh? - Yeah, but where's the beef? - What? - Beef, meat, carne, chicken, poutine. - Unfortunately, we eat only vegetables here. - Don't you get some fish every once in a while. - I wish we did. But we can't eat any kind of meat. That is an important rule. - That sucks. (grunting) (clapping) Jesus. I didn't know anyone was here. - You wanna practice with me? - Okay. (thudding) (grunting) - Too slow. Keep practicing. (bell ringing) (speaks foreign language) (knocking) - Huh? Come in. - You said to come to see you. - Yes, sit down, please, sit down. Would you like to learn a new form of martial art, a kind that takes a new kind of skill. I've been watching you, and I know you can do it. - Hey, Chang, I got nothing but time. - You'll need all the time. This is an artform I created myself in China. It is not taught here in the monastery, and I can only bring you into it if you swear to secrecy and dedication. - Sure, no problem-- - Do not take it so lightly! For instance, why is one leg white and one leg black? - Oh, I-- - And when you see me, call me Master Chang, and you bow. And meet me here five in the morning tomorrow. - Five? Whoa. (shouting) (laughing) - You must keep this a secret because this is a style not for everyone. Understand? - I understand, Master Chang. - You see this rock? I want you to hit the rock. Harder! (grunts) Harder! - (groans) Ow! Fuck! - There is no fucking! This is a monastery! (speaks foreign language) Here, give it to me. Put it down here. - Ow, why did you do that? - The knuckles must be broken and allowed to heal. You must make it rough and flat around it because it is the flatness that gives power to your punch. I want you to hit this rock 100 times a day. - Hey, my hand is broken. - The hand is not broken! The knuckles are broken, and they will heal swiftly. We'll continue tomorrow. (dramatic music) - Ow! - What is wrong with your hand, Paul? - I burned myself in the kitchen. - Ah, let me have a look at it. - No no, it's okay, I took care it already. - Come on, I'll look at it. I took care of it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. (upbeat pop music) - Hey Sara! Where you (stutters) been? We been looking for ya. - What do you want? I don't have the money! - Where's Jimmy? - What Jimmy? Let go of me! - Jimmy the spic. - [Greg] We been looking for him, so where is he? - He was around, but he's not here anymore, you (speaks foreign language). Don't touch me-- - Don't you call me a pinchy thing. - When you use, you gotta pay. So where is he? - I don't have the money, and I'll give it to you soon, alright? - Soon? Soon my ass. - I said I don't have it. I need more time. - More time. Well I'm gonna take mine out in trade. - [Vincent] Well what are you waiting for. - [Sara] Oh God! (speaks foreign language) (coughs) (speaks foreign language) - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah, what about my blowjub, huh? - Fuck you, your blowjob, you fucker! - Come on, break it up, book her! - [Sara] Fuck you, your blowjob, fuck! (grunting) - I said book her, not beat her! - Pick up the jars. No no no, not like that. Grip them by the mouth with your fingers like this. - I've done it. - Now take it to the river and fill them with water, then walk back and empty them into the well. Hurry. Hey, maintain the grip. Dip the jars into the water, into the water. Hey, hey! Mmhmm. That's it. Come on. Come on. (sighs) Good, now continue until the well is filled. Go. (upbeat music) This exercise is more than moving water from here to there. It is to strengthen the fingers which is the foundation of tai chi praying mantis. - That's it, I'm finished. - You've filled the well? - Yes. - Now, bring the well water back to the river. (sighs) (humming) - Hey, careful. Sorry. Why don't you go get the herbs out? - Paul! What are you doing here? - I was picking up the herbs, that's all. - Alright, so you got the herbs! Get out! Get out! ♪ I'm crossing you and ♪ Thanks. - What was that? Master Chang just yelled at me for nothing. - What were you doing? - Nothing. Pick up the herbs, look at the freezer, that's it. - I don't know. Maybe the masters keep their food in that freezer, the really good stuff. - Like that? - A Chinese meal can sometimes be priceless. (grunting) (peaceful Chinese music) - Now, Wu and Paul. - Bow to each other. (speaks foreign language) (tense music) (fists thudding) (grunting) - Hey! Paul, come here! Wu defeated you fair and square. Your first instinct was for revenge and attack. Your first instinct should be to think. Self-discipline and control is the main thing in martial arts, do you understand. Now you will take five hours to meditate and think what you have done. Wait! Before you go, apologize to Wu. (sighing) - Sorry. (tranquil Chinese music) - Student Paul. Why are you sitting? - Master Tsai punished me for hitting a student. I have to meditate for five hours. - Oh, you have done enough. I want you to get some rest. Tomorrow we have a big day. Get up. I will explain to Master Tsai the situation. Go, go. - Finished already? - Master Chang excused me. - I do not believe this. What makes you so special, Student Paul? - I was born lucky, I guess. - No, you're rude and insolent. - Anything else? You know, you've been up my ass ever since I got here. What's your problem? - Um, I don't like you. - Fair enough. (knocking) Come in. Master Tsai. - Paul, you are not meditating. - Master Chang excused me. He told me I needed rest. - Oh. Meditation is important, rest is important, and fighting is important, but there is a time and place for all these things. They must be balanced, Paul. You meditate too little, and you fight too much. Being a good monk means being non-aggressive. - I understand Master Tsai, and I try, I try to be non-aggressive. - You can not try to be non-aggressive. You can only be non-aggressive. - How could I just be? How could I be anything without trying? - Try to take these beads from my hand. - You've been watching too much Kung Fu. - You failed. You took the necklace. Try again. Very good, you either take the necklace or you don't. There is no such thing as trying. Meditation is not about fighting an outside force. It is about being attentive. Just being. Once you have learned that, everything will come easy. Being non-aggressive will come naturally. (peaceful music) (upbeat pop music) - [Greg] What are you doing with those chilies? - What do you think I'm doing? I'm eating 'em! What the hell you'd do that for? You broke my hearing aid. Look at that, you know how much these things cost? - Isn't that for your left ear? Which ear are you deaf in? - I'm deaf in my right ear. - Isn't that a hearing aid for your left ear? - I'm not deaf in my left ear. - Then why do you have one in your left ear? - It was on sale. - [Greg] We gotta go back out to the monastery. - Ooh, I got it to work! I don't wanna go back out there. Fucking monks always ringing that gong. - We gotta go back out there. Lee Hongpo wants us to go back out there. - Makes me deaf. - He thinks Paul (stutters) Marcos might still be out there. - How do we know that he's out there? - Hey. - We have no evidence indicating that he's out there. - Hey. - [Vincent] I don't wanna go out-- - Hey! - What? - We gotta go back out there. Lee Hongpo wants us to back out there, end of story, we go back out there. Now eat your food. It's a good thing you're my brother-in-law. - It's a good thing you're my brother-in-law. - (stammers) Brother-in-law. - The exercises I've been teaching you is the grab and strike method. It's the foundation of the tai chi praying mantis. With the fingers you grab, with the back of the hand you strike. Praying mantis shows no mercy. (groaning) (tense music) - You know if we get caught, we're in big trouble. - Really? - Fishing's a bad thing. - But I love fishing. - Me too. (grunting) (shouting) - Are you hungry? - Yes, I'm hungry. - Ah, let me take you to a fantastic place. - [Paul] I haven't had food like that in a long time. - [Man In Plaid] Hey, check them out. (laughs) (laughing) Sissy boys in dresses! - [Man In Hat] Sissy boys! - [Chang] You know, you haven't eaten a. - [Man In Hat] Is that your sister! (laughing) - [Chang] American food for a long time. - One hairy one and Hari Krishna. - Whatever you want. You miss your Western food? Here, take anything you want! My treat.

(grunting) (groaning) ♪ My trail is a freeway ♪ ♪ Yeah I'm a shooting star ♪ - Paul. Paul! I heard from Wu what you did to those men in the convenience store. Is that true? - Yes, Master Tsai. (grunting) Why are you hitting me? - Martial arts is only for self-defense. I know, I know, Master Tsai. (grunting) - Where did you learn that? (shouting in foreign language) - Master Tsai? Master Tsai? Master Tsai, you wanted to see me? Master Tsai? - Paul. How long have you been waiting? - Not too long, Master Tsai. - Come, sit beside me. - Why do I teach you patience and to meditate? These things may seem incompatible to self-defense and martial arts, but they are not. I know kung fu always emphasize motion, speed, and strength. Motion is preceded by stillness, and slowness precedes speed, and softness precedes strength. To know one is to know the other. You must learn stillness, slowness, and softness, and then you shall gain motion, speed, and strength.

(laughing) (peaceful music) - [Chang] The praying mantis is a killer with his quick, deadly strikes, he finishes his opponent now. Go for the throat, end the fight! - [Tsai] When water and rock meet, it is the water which wears away the rock. Tai chi, the words are about the symbol yin and yang. Yin and yang are complements of each other. Yin is dark, cold, soft, and feminine. - [Chang] Yang is active, horrible, and frightening. - [Tsai] Together, they form a wholeness, and the wholeness is tai chi.

Listen to the song of the crickets. - I went to see Master Chang, and he was drinking. He was breaking everything in the room. He's gone crazy. - Well, he gets that way once in awhile. - But why? - Paul, when Master Chang was in China, he was considered one of the greatest martial artists. Many students want to learn from him, but he chose just a few. Unfortunately, one of those students turned out to be a leader of a mafia. - He trained a guy who went mafia on him and people thought it was his fault? - Well, it wasn't his fault? But people had to blame someone, and they blamed him. - That's terrible. - Yes it is. Now, no one in this temple blames him, but since he lost face, it's a disgrace to him. So when he gets that way, just stay out of his way. - Just one more thing. I saw Master Chang and some men carrying out fish out of the kitchen. I thought we don't eat fish in here. - No, we don't eat fish. We're just storing it for someone. We're the middleman for a small fishing industry. It makes enough money to keep the temple going. (siren blaring) - How's everything? - No problem, everything's cool. - Yeah? - Show him. - Let's check it out. (upbeat music) - So how's the old man? - Same shit, you know how he is. Tell Hongpo this the last time. - You mocking him? - I think it's time we paid the old man a (stutter) visit. - More of that Chan shit. (dramatic music) - Why were you not at my practice? - I am finished with that! - What do you mean by that? - I'm leaving, that's what I mean. - Where are you gonna go? You are criminal! Police will kill you, remember? - Well, I guess I came to the right place. - What do you mean by that? - I know about the drugs. - How? - What difference does it make? - Are you mad? - Yes, I'm very mad. - Are you mad? And are you angry? I need somebody mad and angry to do something for me. - To do what? - You're... You were a drug dealer. You can walk in and out among them. And you can find Lee Hongpo, and kill him. - Kill Lee Hongpo? I don't kill! - Lee Hongpo was my student. He became a fallen angel. Ran drugs through my monastery. Disgraced my order. - Monks don't kill, I'm a monk. - You are just a toy monk. You are my tool! You owe your life to me. I need you to save my monastery. Listen. You are the perfect decoy. They all know us. You can get close to him, and you can kill him and save the monastery for us. - (sobs) You used me. (crickets chirping) - Shall I open it? - I love it when you use two hands. (laughs softly) (dramatic music) (sighs) - Do you wanna try some? - Mmm, (stutters) no thanks. - I'll try some. (snorts) It's okay. - Obviously my shipment has met with his approval. Gentlemen, you know what to do. When everything is done, bring it to my office. Angel, come with me. I have yet another job for you. (laughs) (mysterious music) - Paul, Paul, where are you going? - Into the city. - Are you coming back? - Of course. - What are you doing here so early? - See you soon, Paul. - I'll come back. - Lee Hongpo is a very powerful man. Operates behind the butcher shop on Spring Street. (dramatic music) And he's always guarded. You must use all your strengths to do the job. How do you white boys say it? Good luck. (upbeat Chinese music) (speaks foreign language) - What do you want? - A chicken. (speaks foreign language) - Hey hey! Okay, you pay there, not in here. (speaks foreign language) - Thank you. - You go, you go! (shouting) - You. You. You. You're one of us. You. That's it. The rest of you can try again tomorrow. If you give me a chance, I'll prove that I'm good. - I told you, come back tomorrow. You said that yesterday. Please give me a chance. I'll show you. I'm fast and strong. - You don't look fast and strong. I am, let me prove it. Alright, two hours. I'll take you on for two hours. - Thank you. - But no pay. If you're good, I'll keep you on and pay you. - I'll show you. - Yeah, we'll see. - Now get those crates and haul 'em up there. - Master Tsai! Wu, good morning! - Wu has told me everything. - Ah! - I'm sorry, Master Chang. It just didn't feel right. - How could you bring such shame to our temple? - Hmm. (laughs) (midtempo blues music) (knocking) - Hey, easy baby, what's the hurry, huh? Huh? Just a second, huh? - Kate, stop it, it's me, it's Paul. - (laughs) Paul's dead, huh. You're bald. (laughs) Hey, (mumbles), can you help me out with this thing, huh? Just a second. - Enough of this! - No! (sobbing) - It's over! (whimpering) We're gonna get out of here, it's over. - [Kate] No! (sobs) - It's me, it's me, Paul. - (gasps) Paul! I thought they killed you. - They tried, but I'm alive. - How did you find me? - Sara told me you were working for Gino's big. It wasn't hard after that. - Paul. Is Jack alive? - No. (sobbing) No. - No, no! They swore to me they wouldn't kill you, but they lied, they lied! - Kate, you turned us in? - I had to, I had to! (sobbing) I had to, I had to. Nicky saw us with all that shit and he told Tang. And Tang sent some guys over and they fucked me up. Sorry, I had to, don't you see, huh? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Please, it's okay. (sobbing) It's okay, it's okay. - Sorry. I'm sorry. - I'll take care of you. - My cotton ball's over. (gun firing) (siren blaring) (upbeat rock music) - Take 'em down over there. Hey what are you looking at? Get back to work or else you're not gonna come back! - No no no, I'm sorry. - Ah ah ah, allow me. - Sorry. No, no! (shouts) (grunting) (groaning) - Hey! I told you not to stack those cages that high! - I'm sorry. - Get down here. You wanna get paid, you work! - Okay. - Hey Greg. How ya doing? - Hey, how's it going? - Good. - Is he in? - Yeah, he's upstairs. Hey, what are you doing still up there? I told you to get down. - Just a second. - Now! - I'm gonna go on up. I'll talk to you later. - Yeah. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Sorry, my shirt got stuck in a cage. It won't happen again. - It better not. You did good work before. That's why I'm gonna give you another chance. (humming) - Hey what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up? Hey, sit down man. Hey, what's going on. How's it going, man? - Not so good. - Yeah, I can tell that by looking at that poopoo haircut you got. (laughs) Hey, but I like the zoot suit. So what can I do you for, baby? - I need a big favor, Sammy. - (laughs) Hey, that's why God put me on the green earth. I'm the favor savior, baby. (crowd chattering) (upbeat Chinese drum music) (crowd chattering) (fireworks crackling) - Hey, what are you doing there, baldy? - Going to work. - What's wrong with the front door? - Too many people. - Didn't I bust you last year? Don't I know you? (stammers) (grunting) (groaning) (grunting) (choking) (chickens clucking) (grunting) (upbeat Chinese drum music) - Ben? Is that you? (sighs) Bail. Who are you? - I have a delivery for you from Master Chang. - (laughs) Master Chang, hm? Master Chang! Hah, what are you, one of his toys? - Yes, I am. - Well what is it? Toy one? Toy two? A, B, C? (laughs) Toy who? - I am Paul Marcos. - And what do you want? - I came here to stop your dirty business. - Dirty business? My dirty business? (metal clanging) You know who I am? (metal clanging) (maniacal laughing) Huh? Huh? (shouting) (gun firing) (grunting) I don't die! (shouts) (gun firing) (choking) (gun firing) - What do you want? - Master Tsai and Master Chang, they want to speak to you. - I have nothing to say to you. - Why is that? - Your work is done. I owe you nothing now. Here, that's what killed Lee Hongpo. Not the kung fu training. A gun I could've fired when I was healthy enough to leave the temple. - No, you couldn't. Not the gun or preying mantis. But your heart, your head, and the inner strength you learned from the temple. - But you turned me into a paper dragon, beautiful and strong on the outside and empty and cold on the inside. - Paul, what's done is done, let it go. Come back to the temple and fill yourself with brightness. We'll care for you. Come back. - No. I can't come back. I gotta go on now. - I never meant any of those things that I did to you. I only did that out of respect for Master Chang. - Let him go. (tense midtempo music) (speaks foreign language) (tense midtempo music) (upbeat Chinese music) (MultiCom Jingle)
