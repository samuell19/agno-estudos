I want a strong opinion from the other side. I'm not making up my mind. I want to present opinions. - Okay, speed all around. And, Sarah, go. - I'm here with members of a local organization called GMO-Free Kauai. I'm standing here with Ed Coll, A college professor and activist here in Hawaii. - It's a fallacy that science belongs to these chemical companies. - This is giant corporations specifically own those seeds and patent them. - People became concerned that all this information, they could use it for purposes that are not necessarily in the public good. - In a fishing village, you always take only what you need, and if there's any extra, you share. - They talk about the corn or the corn spray. What about what the sugar used to spray? They used to spray. Who knows what they used to spray? - Long term, nobody has the wisdom to conduct this thing safely. - How you doing? - I'm here with Doctors Ing and Croft, who are overseeing some of the research being done on Joe Howard in terms of his tooth regeneration. - They regenerate.

Unfortunately, last night Celebrity Sperm was broken into, and celebrity sperm was stolen. [laughs] It was right here. Everything was totally staged. - Who's sperm did you want? - Dylan. - Dylan? - Yeah, this man here. - I decided Bob Dylan. So I dressed like Bob Dylan, and I went there looking for Bob Dylan's sperm. - There was nothing there. It was a friend's apartment. So I kept them out by saying, "Oh, sperm's been stolen, auction's canceled." - I want to introduce Sunshine. Sunshine is an artificially inseminated child. She was told that she was artificially inseminated. Well, my task was to appear in videos protesting Joey's celebrity sperm bank, to be a believable lawyer. Since then, she has been looking for her father. She has been on the verge of catatonia. I don't remember any rehearsal. I met the young woman who was playing my client. I might've had a conversation with her about the circumstances. - It was really an improv. It was really like Second City. Everybody had their own part. And that was all they were told. - I want to know about this because it's very dangerous, what's going down here, very dangerous! - He controlled things from a distance. But he let the actors-- he really let them have their way with the script. There was no script. There was never a script. - I'm trying to, you know-- what's the best way of looking at this? You can turn to the camera and say, "We're about to examine..." - We're about to or we already have? - No, we're about to, I guess. That'd be nice, about to examine. - My only thing is that we've got better questions to ask if they've already had the examination. - I'm here with Doctors Ing and Croft, two of the professionals who are overseeing some of the research being done on Joe Howard, specifically in terms of his tooth regeneration that's going on. I'm sorry, you guys, I am out of--I need to-- This is, like, out of nowhere to me, and I don't know what I'm talking about. - The way that was, that was, you know. - Oh, well, it was, but I figured-- I thought that this wasn't the first time. Is this the first time you're ever going to see him? - Yeah, that's what I thought. I mean, that's what I thought. - [sighs] I'm sorry, guys. I'm losing it. What do you want? Any other...? - Coming right from the beginning again. - Mm-hmm. - Well, I was hoping to be the scientific advisor. [chuckles] And so I started thinking all sorts of elaborate ideas about-- And Joey told me what the basic idea was, that there was shark teeth. The guy had grown teeth, yak yak yak yak yak. So I started thinking, "What's the most plausible way of explaining that scientifically?" And I came up with some nice scientific papers. Yeah, this is possible. Yeah, it's kind of on the edge of plausibility, it's a bit wacky, but, you know, it'll probably pass. Then when I told him, in Hawaii, this is what the process is, he was horrified. It was just-- it wasn't silly enough. We use sharks as a source of sustainable and renewable stem cells. - Stop for one second. Do me a favor. - Yeah? - Lie. You're too honest. - [laughing] I'm lying-- I'm lying my ass off here. - I know you're lying. But here's a lie that I think-- - Larry, don't mess with your hair, please. - The lie is, if we can regenerate our teeth like a shark can regenerate their teeth, then we can revolutionize the whole dental industry. - Yeah. - And the point of what we're trying to do is to make it so that humans can now regenerate teeth. That's it. - Forever. - That's what it's about. Fuck the shark. I mean, it's the ability to regenerate teeth constantly. - Oh, okay. - You're doing a good job. You are. Dr. Croft, talk to me about the addition of shark stem cells in your research. - The teeth re-grow in sharks, and once a tooth falls out, another one grows back. So if we can harness the ability that sharks have to re-grow their own teeth, we could do the same thing in humans. And so this would revolutionize the dental industry and would be a fantastic thing for many people. [giggling] Sorry. - There's such a thin line between, you know, what's plausible and what's, like, "Get out of here. I don't believe any of this." - Yeah. - Is it too much ham? - Yeah.

There's a time when you do the performance, and it's going out there. And then when you do the exposé, and you think it's over. Well, there are people who don't ever get the exposé. So I get a phone call from an Italian journalist. "Dr. Schlafer?" So I go, "Hello?" "My name is Sylvia Kramer. I work for 'il Giornale.' I'd like to do a story about your operation." - I said, "Well, look, come to my home, and I'll tell you a story that you'll really enjoy." I was gonna tell her the truth. She calls me back 10 minutes later, "Dr. Schlafer, I'm running late." I said, "Fine, no problem." Then she calls me again, "I'm running late, I'm running late." And then finally the last time she calls, she says, "Dr. Schlafer, I'm sorry, but I can't make it. Can we do the interview on the phone?" Lazy bitch. You know, I was gonna tell you the truth but, you know... I'm not gonna tell you the truth, I'm just gonna continue the hoax.

You think you know when it's over, and it's not over. It's not over. Because the truth is really the hardest thing to get to. - Okay, so, what do you think of this? - I would make the conflict between morality and science up front, more up front. And then get into, "But open-sourcing science has its own issues," you know? I mean, I have to think about this, because... - Can we do it again? - Yep. - The operations and implications of this research and its open-source methodology. - Is this a news report? - It was. - So maybe we don't even need that? - That's what I'm thinking. I think that this intro is so specific. - Yeah. - Taking you directly into something. I mean, that's what we thought it was earlier. - Right. - There's a great big difference between doing what I do, which is a prank, and doing a film. I have to be improvisational. I have to go with the flow. So whatever it is, I've got to be able to make it happen, and so it's different than a film. You have a script, you know, you have the actors, you're paying these people, you know. It's all lit, takes hours. Improvisational theater, guerrilla theater, culture jamming, hoaxes, different ball game. So... - I'm having a difficult time seeing if that's where we're going to end up.

Are you a willing guy to talk about the possibility or the hopefulness of having reconnective nerve tissue done through stem cell research? Warren, who broke his back in a horrible accident in the ocean and he has spinal cord damage, he comes in, and he's the savior for the piece, because he takes the attention away from my shark teeth. I want everyone to have a piece to say, especially Warren. And he says, at the table... - If stem cell research can make it possible for someone who has been in a wheelchair for 20 years to be able to stand up and walk to the bathroom... I can't tell you how wonderful that would be. - Warren carries that whole conversation. It's all about that. Forget about the ethics of doing the research. I need it. - This is heartfelt and the truth. This particular hoax, for me, is personal. It's not just Joey's art. - He's brought a lot friends together who have heartfelt thoughts on these subjects that originally were just the setup. Now they're the topic. - Now, to me. it's more plausible. And I have to have an element of plausibility. I mean, it's so fucking far out anyway. But, you know, now it's concealed. They've got it. And we convince them the next 10 or 15 minutes to accept it and move on, and see the bigger picture. We got it. This particular piece really is a stand-by-itself piece.

It's, you know, a bunch of people talking about serious issues, which could be made, I guess, into a great film by a great filmmaker. But I don't consider myself a filmmaker.

"I wish I hadn't done that. If I could do it over, I would do it this way." I think he really has a lot of self-confidence. He trusts his instincts, and he knows that he can pull a rabbit out of a hat if he needs to, and I've seen him do it. He'll enter into a project because of very strong beliefs about it, even if they are conflicted beliefs or if there's no way to know the actual truth or the actual outcome of what's gonna happen.

And for him, that's hugely exciting. - Have you ever pulled something that's failed? - No. - No, really? Is it that easy? Is there a-- I mean, is there any kind of surefire thing you can do? - It's like producing a theater piece. You conceive, write, produce, direct, stage, act in it. It's very complicated. There are many techniques to gaining access to the media. If you know how the media works, it's kind of easy to give them the hook. - I know that he will never stop being creative, doing projects, coming up with outrageous, outlandish, hilarious ideas.

It has to do with stem cells. - My stories may take off and be an instant-- everyone has to read it. Or they may be a slow, in the back burner, you know, takes time for this to come around.
