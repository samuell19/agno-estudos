Answer me I'll answer you tomorrow. Now please have the food. No, I want the answer now itself. Don't shout. Please have the food first. I will definitely shout if you don't answer my question How could I obey that? No woman will be able to obey that. Why not? Cant's a wife obey to her husband? No, if the husband doesn't care for the respect of his wife... she willn't obey him too. You wanted me to dress like... those whores, wanted me to go around with other males & drink How can any wife tolerate this? Can't a wife even do this much for the sake of her husband? See, I am your wife. And my disrespect will bring bad name... to you too. Why don't you try to understand? Don't you care a little about the sacredness of our relationship? Keep your sacredness to yourself. Cook food and worship the idols But this god of yours who as life, hwill go away for good No, I'll not let you go away. I'll obey whatever you order to me - Will you obey me? - Yes Will you sing & dance -Yes Will you drink? Tell me, will you drink? You are my husband. If you give me poison, I'll have that too. Now let's have the food. Now tell me, what do you want me to do? Oh! You are beautiful You have never even looked at my face. How I pity myself! Again the same drama. This habit makes you look ugly. - Don't go, I'll not cry. - Then sing a song. The cool breeze of spring is blowing in, my dear and so don't keep your window open again. Or else the maddening wind will affect you The light of the lamp is striking the eyes And taking away the sleep in our eyes, my dear Please don't keep the lamps burning today. The cuckoo has doused the flames of my heart But my love remained thirsty - Stop this. Do you call it a song? - Don't you like the song -No You consider yourself to be quite clever. Whenever I feel like... talking to you, you start giving lectures. And now I ask you to... sing a song, you started singing prayers. Then tell me what kind of song should I sing? Sing such such a hit song which has a good rhythm & is lively I don't know how to sing those kind of songs But we have a record player & I bring new records everyday... now you are telling me that you don't know how to sing that - Have you heard that 'Lucy wow wow' song? - Yes Then sing that song. Come with me. Sit here and sing. You spoiled my mood. All the bottles are vanishing. Now I'll not let you go. Excuse me for now, I'll sing the song some other time No, you have to sing it now -I am having a headache Don't make excuses in front of me. You want to fool me. It's okay then -No, I'll sing I can't really sing -Then dance, like the one in films What is her name? Wear this dress and dance. What do you get by insulting me? What pleasure do you get... by giving pain to my soul? As per the scriptures, there is no soul in woman. Then why cry over something which you don't have What are you doing? Wait, I'll change the dress and dance Now you only can tell me. I have already done enough. How much will I have to fall? What should I do? Why are you taking so much time. Come soon I am putting on the record. I'll count till three and if you don't... come, I'll break the record. Won't you come? Okay! One, two..., here you've come! What are you doing by standing there? Come near me Let me have a look at you. Come near me. I am only one and lovers are many! They attack my heart together See, what a problem I have got in my small heart My cheek is of pink colour and have blue eyes People think that I am shining like a thunderbolt when I smile Where have you vanished? Oh! You haven't worn your clothes till now How dare you stand naked in front of me? Get out Go off and never come back! See some rascal has kept the drum in the middle - They are not at all sincere. - Let's take it away Why are you making the noise? Have you caught the thief? Not the thief, but the drum -Whose drum is this? You have kept the drum in the middle & asking us whose it is! This drum actually belongs to the rascal opposite my room He is not at all sincere. He keeps even the garbage... in front of my door. You are all strong. Go & complain to him. What's the matter-Why have you kept your drum in middle - That's his drum, not mine. - But he is saying that it's yours - How dare you? - Can't you identify the owner of this... drum with a hole even by looking at the whole in his vest?

Have I told you a lie -No Have I mixed poison -No The people are becoming richer by taking money from the poor I am calling it theft and people call it your good fortune Be careful & stay away! I have seen many scholars taking God's name & give alms But in real life they enjoy the public money I have seen the honest ones getting hanged And the guilty are enjoying freely Am I telling a lie -No The thief should not run away while we are busy in singing You go that way, we'll go this way Sardarji, come this way and have a seat What is your name? Why don't you tell me your name? Answer me Who are you? See, he died as he was laughing too much. Please bring some water It is not going to help this way, let's take him to the hospital This entire hue and cry about the thief is baseless Actually someone must have considered one as a thief.. In his intoxication. Everything is false But is there anything true in life? You are your father's son... & you are son's father. Then in reality are you a son or a father Seen this picture of Mr Ram? He trades in fake notes... still people call him Rambabu. I have never gone to the... medical college ever, still I am a doctor. Don't laugh like that. Have you ever seen your face in the mirror? Girls will faint... seeing you. Still your name is Madan. So whatever is going on... - in the world is true. - All your arguments are scientific. What is this? Where are they taking Kumbhakarna? What is the matter? Why don't you tell me? Tell Rambabu that I'll be back soon after solving this problem Silence! What happened to him? He became senseless while laughing-Speak in turns. He again became senseless after gaining consciuousness Let me examine him Not a serious problem - Is he caught? - Don't make noise in the hospital - But there was a thief. - Go & catch the thief outside, not here Why've you taken the trouble to come here? I was going anyway His condition is so serious that he has to be admitted in hospital - Who? - My employee, he got a cardiac arrest following... - the noise about the thief. - I'll just join you But why are you looking so worried? If you want to work under me, don't argue Go and make all the arrangements and wait for.. My signal. As soon as you get it, carry all the money... to the safe place without stopping anywhere in the middle Open it We will bring the stretcher soon. Ask Madan to give all the money - Is there anything left? - No Disconnect the machine, I am coming downstairs Give me the key of this room Do it fast. Make him lie down in the bed and cover him Let's take him to the hospital first Come fast Don't gather here, please go away There he is dying and you are having fun by gathering here Go away Take away the stretcher and bring in the bed Spread all the notes on the bed Doctor, it's all now your responsibility - Mine? - Of course As soon as you get my signal, carry the bed on your shoulders.. And don't stop anywhere in the middle till you cross the gate Baralbabu and Pranbabu is here -Bring them in No, not here. They may also have similiar business. But why should I show them my privacy? Go & keep them busy... in talking. I'll join you Both of you go out & stand on guard on the road -Ok Rambabu will join us, let's have a seat there We have come to meet you, not him -Me? Doctor, we need the bed urgently - The bed is highly in demand this night. - How come? Rambabu is sending his goods in the bed tonight. I have already... issued a death certificate for him. How can I do it again? Whenever we are in need, you always say Rambabu is... - sending his goods. - Then how will we run our business? We also donate a lot of money for this hospital Baralbabu, it was my idea to open the hospital, and I put... my money on it at first. So my goods will always go first Then what's the use of putting our money in it Stop this rubbish now. I want to know from the doctor... whether we will get the bed or not Keep your cool in this trying time. It's no use losing temper What are you saying, Rambabu? You are our elder & learned too Excuse us for speaking like this out of anger. But please help us Please do something as there is danger around Why should you be worried as your goods are minimum So what? The danger is not minimum OK, if you have faith on me, bring all your goods to my house I will take care of them. Sometimes you really talk funny This is not the time to laugh. Carry the bed out. So the bed is already loaded Yes, go and bring your goods here as fast Why are you bringing yourself to all these troubles? Doctor, you are my employee not I am yours - Can you tell me the reason? - Because you are more intelligent Yes. As I scolded them I had to bring them back to me... otherwise they will tell everyone after going out Now come and let's take Mayeed out No, first spread the news of his death outside, then I'll carry him Is it so? Then take this. Now all the responsibility is yours. - Where is Chandubabu? - He has gone that way Go & tell him that if he wants to catch the thief... he should meet Gopichand immediately. - Meaning? - I want to bring down the heat in Rambabu What happened Rambabu? How can I say! He was my old employee from the village. He got fever suddenly and died He is our Rambabu. He has announced a reward of a... - gold medal to the thief catcher. - Please make some space - Gold medal... - Listen to another news. One of his old employees... was having a weak heart and he died few hours back Can you please show us the dead body There is the bed. Let's see it We have to take a photo. What's the noise? This is a hospital. Go away from here - Why are you troubling the others? - What do you mean? We have seen the thief in the hospital. Go there with a force... - and check all the covered things well. - Are you sure? If you don't find the thief there, I'll give you a gold medal Remove the cloth from his face It'll not be removed. Lift him and carry him outside We want to take a photograph for Press, why're you objecting? - Objecting? - Actually, You want to have fun with the dead body No, I'll not allow you to take my brother's photograph We don't get peace even after death -See what have you done! Listen, it'll just take one second, & it'll be published in newspaper No, we don't see dead man's face in our community Why don't you leave, as he is objecting - But what is there to object? - Why not? You have no right... to play with people's sentiments and beliefs But will you object if we take a photo of the covered dead body? OK, take it I'll count till three and you uncover the face by that time Halt your search. Come with me I had given all the responsibility to you. Then how could that... - person get in there? - I don't know anything about it, Rambabu Don't try to fool me, you know that my name is Ram Mullick Please believe me. I swear, I don't know anything. The news is already spread that Mayeed is dead. And Press also.. Took his photograph. If we get a real dead body... - what's wrong in it? - You are right Sir Poison Come with me soon Somehow we will have to finish him soon. He has seen everything. Aren't you the thief? You need money, don't you? Come, I'll give you money. Bring all the money. Take these money. Madan, hang a piece of cloth there. If we open the door, they will cut you to pieces. Go this way. Thief! Thief! Madan, go to the terrace immediately. You also go there, & finish him before anyone reaches there Take this. But careful, you shouldn't be seen - OK. Beware! If anyone comes forward, I'll break his head. What is my fault that you are following me? I am the son of... a poor village farmer. I came to the city in search of a job. Being thirsty, I get inside your flat to have few drops of water You consider it to be my fault and treating me like a dog... by calling me a thief. But am I the real thief? I have seen different kinds of thieves & thefts in all the flats... I have entered. Right from looting respect of a wife.. To stealing wife's jewelleries, printing fake notes... and making liquor, I have seen all kinds of sinners & thieves. Being educated, you only want to give me the lesson that... one can't be rich without being a thief! Okay, this poor has... learnt today that I should be a thief or a robber and gather... money by ill means and become richer than you all by crushing... your heads. I will do that for sure. Who are you? Are you the thief? The door should be kept open in the morning, otherwise... how will the light come inside? What is this? You hurt your head and it's now bleeding. Let me see it. It's bleeding a lot & you haven't put any medicine - Won't your mother beat you? - I don't have a mother. - What have you stolen? - I stole nothing at all Will you steal my bangles? I'll not tell to anybody. Take these... I am not a thief, child. I have never stolen anything. Wake up. When the light comes and removes the darkness of mind Wake up, my Lord Mohan. Wake up as the world has woken up. Wake up, Lord Mohan. The new age is touching your eyes. Wake up, as all the roads & cities have woken up. Afraid? But you haven't done anything. You will always find the world shining... if you burn the lamp in your mind. The sunlight is making the earth shine. And fills the thirst of everyone yearning for light The sunlight is making the earth shine. And fills the thirst of everyone yearning for light. And the mind's worries go away and it blossoms.
