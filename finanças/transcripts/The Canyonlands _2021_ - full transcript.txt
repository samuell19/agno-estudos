Okay. Yeah, come in. Hey. Sorry to wake up you, but you left your phone out here, and Chief has called you a few times. Thanks, I'll call him. Hey, try not to stay up too late. We're just hanging out. Mm hm. Yeah right. Turn your fuckin' music down, dude. Hey, sorry I missed your calls. I went to bed early. I thought you wanted me to take the Westwater tour? Okay, sure, no problem. You, too. See you in the morning. - There she is. - Hey, there. I brought you some coffee. - You're a lifesaver. - I know. So, what's up? Why'd you pull me from the Westwater trip. Alex is really sick. Food poisoning or something. Is he gonna be okay? Yeah, yeah, he'll be fine. But he can't do the Canyonlands trip tomorrow. And? Well, I was hoping- - That I would do it? Yeah. Look, I know it's not your favorite place. Not my favorite place? I almost died there! A man's in a wheelchair for the rest of his life because of what I- - It's not your fault. - It is my fault! Okay, can't Scott do it? He's not as good as you. It's for those contest winners, and I don't wanna screw it up. This is such bullshit. You know I wouldn't ask you if I didn't think you could do it. The company needs you. I need you. Nice. Way to guilt trip me. Seriously, I need you. I took you in when you were what, six? Now look at you. You know this place better than I do. I just don't wanna let you down. You won't. Fine, I'll do it. Great. Thank you. Be here in the morning and I'll drive the guests over. - How many people? - Five. Okay, I can handle that. I know you can. Hit a few easy rapids, you know, show 'em a good time. I'm gonna go check on the gear and make sure it's all good. Any other surprises? Check in with Rob before you head out. He'll go over some things with you. And no more surprises. Is he in the garage? Yeah. And don't worry, I'll take care of all the important people for you. Only you can do it. Mm, that's hilarious. - Hey. - Hey. Chief says you're taking the contest winners out tomorrow? Funny, I just agreed to that, so he must've been confident I'd say yes. Ah, yeah, you know Chief. It's like he's got ESP sometimes I think. How's your ankle? Ah, it's okay. Easier than dealing with this trip. Bunch of spoiled millennials. You know you're a millennial, right? Yeah and I suck. That's true. But you know I love babysitting a bunch of whiny kids, so. It's one overnight. You'll be back before you know it. That's easy for you to say. You owe me a beer when I get back. I'll buy you two. What else do I need to know about them? Awesome. Hey, guys. I'm Lauren, I'm gonna be your guide. A little bit about me. I was born and raised right here in Southeastern Utah. I've been rafting and guiding in this area since I was 14 years old. - So, you're in good hands. - She knows the river better than I do. I don't know if that's true, but how about you? Where are you from? Hey, guys. I'm Sarah and I live in Phoenix. I'm a social media influencer and I can't wait to share my trip with all my followers. So, what up, y'all, I'm Ryan. I'm out from L.A., training to be an MMA fighter, you know? Super stoked for this trip, you know? And especially the 5k, right? Woo, yeah! Cool, all right, Ryan. Yeah, who wouldn't wanna win a free 5k? That's cool. How about you? Uh, hello, everybody. Uh, my name's Kyle and I'm from Las Vegas. And uh, I am into computer software design and bitcoin. Nerd alert. Okay, no, not on my trip, all right? What up, crew? I'm Dave, I'm from Denver and I'm in the weed business. I'm here to have a good time. You will, you will. Last one. Uh, what's up? I'm Jennifer, I'm from Salt Lake City, and I work at a climbing gym. Dope. All right, well, great to meet all of you. We will be on the river for two days and one night, and then we will meet Chief on the other side of the park. There's gonna be a lunch with a presentation of your checks when we reach the end. That's what I'm talking about. Show me the money! - Yes! - Wow. Uh, any other questions? Uh, yeah, is there gonna be like cell service there? Eh, no. There's not gonna be any cell service. - No, I'm serious. - Wait, what? Uh, but I'll have a sat phone for emergencies. And other than that we will be completely off the grid. Any other questions? Cool, let's head to the raft. So, um, we will be at the pickup point at 10:00 a.m., the day after tomorrow. There's been a lot of rain and with the snow melt all sorts of debris is floating around. So, keep an eye out for logs and submerged boulders. Okay, will do. Trust me, I don't wanna flip again. You should camp near Claret Mine. It's away from the river a bit, so no mosquitoes. Okay, good point. How am I supposed to post with no cell service? Just post your pics after. You know, TBT, Flashback Friday. But I promised everyone live updates. Guess they'll just have to live without you for a days, princess. Just smoke some weed and enjoy the trip. Great, that's all we need is you smokin' blunts all day. Blunts? Hell nah, you think I'm gonna ruin a good smoke with that shit? You think just because I'm black I smoke blunts? Whatever, man, all right. Just keep the smoke away from me. I gotta piss in a cup in a week. Uh, I heard this company dumped a raft here before and people got hurt. What? Where did you hear that? Last night at dinner. I was sitting next to a local. What happened? He didn't exactly know what happened, just that people ended up in the water. Were stranded for days. Oh, shit, we're all gonna die. Shut up. I'm sure it's gonna be fine. And how would you know? Because I've done tons of rafting trips like this, okay? It's not gonna be anything crazy. Whatever, I need to take a selfie, make a post, and video chat my dog. Damn, she's hot. Hm, not really my type. And what exactly is a social media influencer? Come on, bro, you're telling me you wouldn't hit that? I think she means like an Insta model or something. And yes, I would hit that. Damn! So, later, you, me and her can you know, have some fun? Absolutely not. Also I'm gay and if you touch me you die. That went well. - Shut up. - What, what I say? I've learned it's best to shut up when people tell me to. So, maybe you should do as he says and shut up. Why does everyone keep telling me to shut up? All I'm saying is be careful. Keep an eye out from trouble. I don't wanna come looking for you again. Okay, enough already. Let's talking about what happened last time I went out here. Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. I could get used to this. I shoulda brought some more weed. Best to stay alert. The river gets lonely. She will pull you under if she feels like it. So, when did people live out here? Tribes have been here for thousands of years. There's a bunch of cliff dwellings hidden up in the caves and you can see pictographs and petroglyphs. Damn, sounds like a rough life. Yeah, but they ate a shit ton of peyote though. So what? So, peyote's fun as hell. I would totally eat that shit out here. - Trip my balls off. - Yeah, sounds like a blast. Well, I didn't bring any peyote, but I did pack some beers. Woo, ah yeah. So, are most of the native tribes still here? Yeah, well, there's five native tribes to Utah, two in Canyonlands, Navajo and Ute. But most of the tribes didn't make it out when the miners and the ranchers moved in. Manifest destiny. Hey, Sarah? Sarah? Can you grab your, can you grab your oar? We need you. - Okay. - Thanks. Yeah. You guys did awesome - on the rapids. - Woo, that was sweet! - Fuck yeah it was. - Yeah. The campsite's not too far away, so we got a little bit of a hike, but it shouldn't take long. Yeah and we got a dark cloud rolling in, so let's keep moving. Hike? Yeah, it's just about quarter of a mile or so. It's a real cool stretch and... Keep paddling. Keep paddling, Kyle. Uh, I thought this was like a rafting trip, not a hiking trip. Well, you'll be glad we got away from the river 'cause there's tons of mosquitoes down there. Lovely. - Oh, my God, I got a bar. - That's not- - Are we almost there? I need to make a post. Are you gonna be worried about - that this whole time? - It's my job, okay? Just saying you'd have more fun if you put your phone down. You guys, there's a storm coming in. Let's speed it up. This is not working on my face. Guys, I made a game. You wanna play? Nah, you know I'm really, that's uh- Maybe later. - That's okay. - I drew a circle and you throw rocks in it. God, it is so beautiful here! Just all the colors. It's pretty killer for sure. Are you gonna be on a phone that doesn't have service the whole time? Are you gonna be smoking weed the whole time? Hell yeah. I'm organizing my posts for later. OMG, okay. If you guys need to go to the bathroom just go a little bit away from camp. There's a bunch of old mines back there, so watch your footing. Are you kidding me? That's cheating. Yeah, so what? Could you like help me? You know like, girls are really good at like being like sporty and stuff. - It's like a really cute look. - Totally. So, that would be like so much fun. Yeah, that'd be so great. Like we could have like slumber parties and stuff. - Totally, yeah. - You know? I would love that. Oh, my God, I haven't done that in like forever. So, yeah, years. Yeah, I was like modeling for a car or something, and like that was really cool. And that's when I was like, you know what? Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out, check it out. I bet you I could climb that. Yeah, right. You can't climb that. I could do it a blindfold on it's so easy. Dude, those steroids have gone to your head. You cannot climb that. All right, well, if you're the expert. Let's see you do it. Yeah, no, I'm gonna pass. Look, we'll make a contest out of it. Whoever gets to the top wins. Wins what? I'll think about that while I'm waiting for you to catch up. You guys are crazy as hell. It's gonna be dark soon. You won't be able to see shit. Yeah, but you're a pussy and I'm not. - You sure about that? - Burn! Yeah, I'm sure, all right. I like pussy, but I'm not one. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. So, what happens if a girl beats you? That can't happen. Okay, look, it's getting kind of dark right now, but first thing in the morning if we have time, I'm gonna kick your ass. Who's the pussy now? So, whoever wins gets a kiss from me and I'll post it. That works for me. I really think you guys should wait for Lauren to get back. Why, we don't need her. We're gonna be right back, all right? Play your game, shut up. What do you say? Are you in or are you out? I guess we can go down there and check it out. Y'all wanna smoke some weed before you go? Just sayin'. You ready to lose? Lead the way. I'll be right back. This should go well. They legalized it in Vegas. That's my next stop. Hey, where's Lauren at? I thought she was bringing beers? She went that way. Some guide. She's supposed to be taking care of us. Hey, everyone doin' okay? I will be once I smoke this bowl. Where's Jennifer and Ryan? Um... Uh, um, they went to climb that cliff. What? When did they leave? Maybe five minutes. Shit, I left it at the raft. Hey, Dave? Listen, I need you to go back and get my red bag. What you mean me, why me? Why can't you go? Because I need to go find them and. Okay, fine, I'll go. But for the record you should just wait here for them to come back. Thank you for your input. Yeah, whatever. Hey, you guys stay at the campsite. Don't move. You hear what I said? Yeah, don't move. Where are we? I think we just need to go a little bit further. I'm not sure about that. I think maybe we should head back. Giving up so soon? No, I'm just not stupid. What the fuck is that? It sounds like gunshots. Maybe we should get back. Is that... - Are you okay? - Where did she come from? Wait, wait, wait, what's going on? This can't be good. What are you scared of a little girl? Maybe she needs help. Hey, wait. We don't know where we're going. Who's the pussy now? Shit. I hope they get back soon. Did you hear that? Hear what? I coulda sworn I heard something that sounded like horses or something. I didn't hear anything. Haven't you been smoking weed with Dave? I didn't. I mean, I'm not high anymore. Hm, boo! Oh, Kyle, relax. At least the moon's comin' up, we'll have a little bit of light. I need to take pictures and videos of all this. Is that really all you can think of right now, posting shit online? It's how I make my money, okay? Do you have over 82,000 followers? Didn't think so. You didn't have to be so mean. Wait, I just heard something. I didn't hear anything. Listen. Did you hear that? I told you I heard something. You should go check it out. Me? Why me? I'm not going down there. Well, neither am I. Didn't you say you had to go the bathroom? Just go down there and do it. Okay, but I'm not going too far. It's scary as shit down there. Okay. Uh, uh, uh. Back so soon? Kyle, quit playing games. This isn't funny. Kyle. Kyle. Who are you? No, please, no! Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. I thought heard like a voice. A scream or something. Are you losing it? No, not yet at least. I did hear something though. Maybe someone fell. Let's just go back to camp. You just wanna bang that selfie princess. So, you do too. Yeah, but right now I wanna find that girl. Wait, do you need help? Jesus, this is some stupid shit. Jennifer? Ryan? Can you guys hear me? Fuck. Jennifer! Ryan! Goddamn it. I can't believe that shit. Oh, go send the black dude to go fetch the shit. I gotta get the fuck outta here. I didn't see or hear anything. They come back yet? Sarah, you go to bed? Sarah? Sarah, are you okay? Sarah? Jesus Christ, what happened Sarah? Who did this? I did. Stay away from me. Jesus fuckin' Christ, dude. - What the fuck? - She's dead! He killed her! Oh, fuck that hurts! He killed her! What are you talking about? She's dead. The guy appeared outta no where. Who's dead? - What guy? - Sarah at the fire. The hottie? What happened? I dunno. I heard some sounds and then I went to take a piss and when I came back... And? What the fuck are you talking about? She was lying there dead. Blood everywhere. Then he was behind me. Who was behind you, Ryan? No, not Ryan. It was this crazy looking weird guy who appeared outta nowhere and just said he did it. You still high? - What else did he say? - Nothing. I mean, I just, like I just ran outta there as fast I could. Well, let's go back to the campfire and see what's going on. No. Not me. I'm not going back up there. Well, what the fuck you gonna do then, stay here? I dunno. I'm not going back up there. I'm going back to the fire. It's gonna take me a while. Sorry. Sarah? Oh, shit! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What the fuck's going on? Hey, where are you? Up here. You find that girl or what? Yes. Well, does she need help? Who the fuck is that? I dunno, but I think we should leave. Good idea. Hey, it's you. Glad you could make it. What the fuck happened to Sarah? Oh, shit, he was right. - Who was right? - Kyle. Kyle, I ran into him or he ran into me on my way back from the raft. What'd he say? Nothing that made sense. Just that he killed or some shit like that. What the fuck is going on? How do I know you didn't do this? Me? Hell nah, I went to go grab this. When I left she was alive. This is so bad, this is really bad. Yeah, no shit. All right, so he saw what happened? What did he say? No, he didn't see what happened. He just said he went to the bathroom and he came back she was gone. That's it? No, no, he said he also saw this crazy guy who said he did it. - Crazy guy? - Yeah, that's what he said. Gimme my bag. Oh, hell yeah. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. No answer, he's supposed to be on call. - Who? - Rob. I'll call back in a bit. Rob? Who the fuck is Rob? Call the damn police. Call 911, she's dead for Christ's sake. It would take hours for anyone to get out here right now. Where's Kyle? - I need everyone together. - Down by the raft. I don't know where he was going though. I told him to come back here. Okay, listen. I'm gonna go get him. Grab a t-shirt, wrap it around your leg. Try not to freak out. Yeah, too late for that. Oh, God. These are our footprints. We've been here before. This whole place is like a fuckin' maze. I have no idea where the fuck we are! I think the campsite's that way? It can't be that far. Yeah, I think if we just head in that direction we'll get back to the campsite. What if we never get out? I just wanna get away from, from whatever the fuck it was we saw. Yeah, for once I agree with you. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened up there? - I didn't see what happened. - Yes, you did. I, I didn't see what happened. We heard some noises and I went to go check it out and I pissed. When I came back she was dead. You're fucking lying to me. I am not lying to you. Why is there blood all over your fuckin' hands? 'Cause I, I was checking out Sarah. She's dead! Are you kidding me? She was bleeding, of course I'm gonna have it on my hands. I swear to God I didn't kill her. There was this creepy guy who said he did it. Can you look at me? I'm not capable of doing something- Sarah's dead, Lauren. - Come on. - Let's get back to the campsite and get the others. I'm not going back out there. I'm staying right here. We need to stay together if we're gonna get outta here. He's out there. I'll just stay with the raft. You gotta come back here. Fine, stay here. And don't fuckin' move! I won't. What the fuck was that? I dunno, maybe a bird? A bird at night? Didn't sound like an owl. What the fuck is going on? I'm starting to not like this. Just now? This place is crazy. It's like we've been dosed. Seeing and hearing fucked up shit. I gotta get the fuck outta here. I gotta get the fuck outta here. I gotta get the fuck outta here. Hey, it's just me. - Did you find him? - Yeah. He tell you what happened? Uh huh. He didn't come with you? No, he's gonna stay at the raft. I think we should get the other two and get outta here. Well, maybe he did it? It was just the two of them. I don't think he did this, okay? - And he said he didn't do it. - Oh, well, as long as he said he didn't do it. You said you didn't do it and I believed you. Yeah, he did look a little scared when I saw him. Okay, maybe he's telling the truth. Look, listen, I heard a lotta crazy shit when you were gone. Crazy shit, like what shit? Like horses running and gunshots and shit, and weird ass yells. You've been smoking weed. Look I'm serious, okay? What do you think happened? Sarah tripped and fell on an ax? There's something going on here. I don't know what happened, okay? I didn't see it! I don't know! Oh, shit. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay. Define okay. We shouldn't stay here. What, no. We have a fire, I can find more wood, and I can't move that far with my leg. I'm gonna go try to find them. You should come with me. With that killer out there? Are you crazy? I'd rather be a moving target than a sitting duck. - Fuck! - Come on. We never should have tried to go this way. You wanted to go this way. It can't be this hard to walk like half a mile. Apparently it is. I'm gonna climb up and see where we are. I can climb up if you want. Look, I know you're like a manly man, but just because you are doesn't mean you can do this shit better than me. We can make this the bet. Now? You wanna do the stupid bet now? Let's just get the hell outta here. I usually have an easier time with women. I am sure you do, but I'm not interested in your dick, so get over it. I'm gonna get as high as I can and see what we can see in the moonlight. Shit! I don't think I can go any higher. And I can't see shit up here. What'd you say? I said I can't see shit! There's like a faint glow over there. Over where? It doesn't matter. We can't get to it from here. We're gonna have to find another way. I'm coming down. I'm freaking out. We're fucking lost. Well, we could sit here and wait for the sun to come up and then find our way out after. Or we could go back over there and stay in the cave. No thanks. I wanna get back to the fire. We could keep each other warm. Dude, how many times do I have to tell you to fuck off?! Okay, okay, calm down. Calm down? You want me to calm down? I am in the middle of fucking nowhere in a fucking desert, in some kind of godforsaken maze with some douchebag who won't stop fucking hitting on me, and you want me to calm down?! Just sayin'. Never tell women to calm down! Don't you know that? Maybe we should just start yelling. Yeah, 'cause that's gonna work. Hey! Where are you guys? Can you hear me? Keep it up. I think it's working! Thanks, asshole. I think I will. Hello! Are you finished? I'm gonna yell and scream as much as I want to, okay? I don't think it's helping. You know what's not helping is you. Whatever, I coulda left you out here alone. Wow, such a gentleman. And newsflash, I don't need you. Hello? I'm trapped with an asshole. Hilarious. Thanks for yelling that one. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, yes, we can hear you! - Not helping, huh? - Whatever. - Is it them? - Yeah, it's them. Where are you? Down here, we're down here. Can you guys climb up? No, we can't. It's too steep. They can't climb out, so I'm gonna go down. Down there, how'd they get down there? I have no idea. It's easy to get lost out here. I'll find a way to come down to you. Yes, finally some help. We'll see. How is she gonna get down here? Hopefully not by gravity. Yeah, good luck with that. - How's your leg? - Feels like shit. All right. You should stay here. Alone in the dark? I can't risk you getting hurt anymore. I'll be back soon. She's coming down. I'm gonna stay up here. - I told you. - Whatever. How long? Not sure. She has to find a way down. Could be a while. Yeah, but at least we're making progress. Hey, is Sarah with you? Who? You know, Sarah, the hot girl from Phoenix. Always thinking with your dick, huh? Whatever, at least she likes dick. Is she with you? Oh, Sarah, yeah. Uh, well, the short answer is no. What's the long answer? Um, you know, I'm gonna let Lauren break it down to you. What the fuck does that mean? Maybe she's not interested in you. Yeah right. Oh, you handle rejection really well. Whatever. - Where are you going? - To take a piss. Glad you could make it, but do you mind? Unless you want some action. Okay, let's get- Who the fuck are you? I'm warning you bro, I fight in the Octagon. I'll kick your ass. Fuckin' talk goddammit. Fuck! Dude, took you long enough. We gotta go. - We gotta get outta here. - Why, what's going on? We gotta go into the cave. We're waiting for Lauren. No, no, no, there's no time for it. We gotta get outta here now. I told you I'm not going in that cave. What is going on? Seriously? Seriously, why? Who the hell is that? I dunno, but he swung his ax at me. What are you talking about? Hey, look, man, we're just, we're just kinda lost. Can you tell us how to get outta here? We gotta go, we gotta, we gotta go, we gotta go! I can't see shit! Come on, just keep moving. Fuck, I need some goddamn light! Shit. Stay behind me. Run! I said, run, now! Come on, bring it. Let's get the fuck outta here. Ryan, what's wrong? Run, save yourself. Dave, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. It looks like they went in this cave. I'm going in. Stay where you are. Somebody help me! Help! Help! Somebody help me! Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Come on. Wake up. Shit. Wake up, come on. Wake up! Please, please, wake up. Please wake up. Please! Stay away from me! Oh, what the fuck? Hey! Are you still here? Hey, yeah, I'm here. What's going on? Everyone okay? You have to get me out of here. You have to help me. Jennifer? You okay? I, I, I, I, I can't really climb that well. I hurt my leg. Please you have to! He's coming! Everyone's dead. You have to help me! Everyone's dead? Yes and he's coming! You have to help me! I'll come find you. I, I, I don't have a rope or anything. Shit. You gotta climb out. Come on, you can do it. I can't! You have to, come on. You can make it. You're a badass rock climber. Come on, Jen, you can do it. You can do this, you can do this. Are you climbing? I'm trying! Come on, you can make it. Just come on, you're almost there. Grab my hand. I can't, it's too far! Yes you can, you've got this! Just grab my hand. No! Jennifer! No, no. I'm so sorry. Hello? Is someone down there?! Dave, you still up there? Yes, I'm up here! You're alive?! So far. How do we get outta here? I can't climb up from where I'm at! You're gonna have to come down! It's a little ways down on the right! I'm not sure I can do that with my leg! We have to stay together if we're gonna get the fuck outta here! So, you want me to basically fall down a cliff? You can slide down! - I did! - I can't do that. Listen, we need to get outta here. I'm not leaving without you! - Shit! - All right, so get down here! Get your fucking ass down here, pronto! All right, all right, fine. Where do I go? It's a couple hundred yards down on the right. I'm gonna go grab the sat phone and I'll meet you there. - You're almost there. - This fucking sucks. Oh! Oh, shit. Easier coming down than going up. Yeah, I guess. Thanks. What the hell happened to you? A rock I think. So, uh, everyone else is... Mm hm, yeah, I think so. Kyle's still at the raft. This is fuckin' crazy. What's going on? I don't know. But I think we should head to the raft. Have you tried calling someone again? Oh, shit, I forgot. And I'm the stoner. - Dammit! - What now? - Oh, it's not charged. - What? What the fuck is wrong with you people? Rob was supposed to charge it before I left, but I don't know what happened. Okay, fuck. Chief, Chief, you there? Lauren, yes, I can hear you. Chief you need to come get us with the boat right now. I know, I know what's going on. You know? Yes, but I can't help right now. Something's happened here too. What, what do you mean? Rob's dead. He, uh, he hung himself. Lauren, listen to me. Find him. You know who I'm talking about. Find him. What? Look, Chief, Chief. Chief, are you there? Chief! - Fuck! - What the hell was that? Is he calling the police? Or better yet, the fuckin' army? No, he isn't. Call 911, now. - Enough with this horseshit. - It's dead! Oh, of course it is. So are we, fuck! I need to find him. Who? The crazy guy? I don't know, but I'll know when I see him. And what if he finds us first? I got this. And if that don't work? Then run as fast as you can. Is this the way out? Yeah as long as we come out near the raft. We're gonna fuckin' die out there. Dave, listen to me. We're not dying out here, okay? We're getting to the raft and we're getting outta here. What the fuck is this place? Stay with me. I don't know why this is happening. Am I missing something? Uh uh, I just keep seeing people in my head. That doesn't sound good. - Yeah. - Here, let's keep moving. Okay. Fuck! I think we're getting close. What's going on? What's that, that light? This is just like a dream I had. A dream? I thought I was the one with the fucked up dreams. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely the same. What happens in the dream? I dunno, I always wake up. Who's that? Welcome, Lauren. You have nothing to fear. What about me, do I got anything to fear? I was supposed to find you. Yes. - Welcome home. - Home? Who are you? I am a leader of a forgotten tribe. The white man drove us from our fertile lands to the east, took our game. Scoured the land for materials precious to them, dammed the streams that gave us water. Right here in this very place many moons ago, we took refuge from the white man. Uh, sorry to interrupt. Uh, there's a crazy ass guy here killing people. We cool here? You have nothing to fear from us. We are peaceful spirits. Stewards of the land. What happened here? I've seen things in my head. Let me show you. It was sunset when they came; miners. They wanted the land. And the gold was worth more than our lives. What did you see? She saw her end and why we are here. Why are we here? Why is this happening? The miners were unbelievers, but they didn't know what they did. But this is our land and when they murdered us, a blood debt was created. Our spirits could not entire into the spirit realm without retribution. You mean you have to kill them first to release yours? In a way, yes, but they were very effective. There was no one left to fight them. And only a few of my tribe remained alive, and they were powerless. So, you've been here this whole time? We are part of the land. And only involving innocent people can release us now, but I will not allow it. We will not hurt innocent people even if we must sacrifice ourselves. So, who was the crazy guy killing people? And why? When the blood debt was created it also tied their spirits to the land. And they need to end every bloodline in the tribe to be released. So, so, the people he's killing are a part of the tribe? They seem hella white to me. No, they are part of the miners' families. Five miners, five families, five contest winners. Why would they kill their own families? That doesn't make any sense. Not they, him. After he murdered many of my people, he turned on those that helped him. Gold can drive a man to do terrible things. He killed the others for it, and their spirits joined ours tied to the land and part of the debt. He needs to eliminate all their bloodlines, too. And he needs one of them for his plan. You have seen him. And he used people to set it up. To make sure the right people won and to place his weapon of choice. Rob, he helped? Well, I ain't seen the motherfucker yet. You will. It's me. - I'm the one he wants. - Yes. You are the last blood of our tribe. Yeah, but which one does he need? Hey, guys. It's just me. Dude, you're alive! Oh, that's some scary shit. I just wanna go home now. Let's get to the raft and get the hell away from here. Wish it were that simple. You see, it has to happen here. What has to happen? The end. He has to do it here to release his spirits. You have to do it here to release ours. Well, that's a buzzkill. Why would you let me come here if I'm the last one? You should want me to stay away from this place. I will not allow innocent life to be taken. We are an honorable people. You are here because you're the only one that can help them and us. I had a premonition. I heard a voice from the sky that said our pain would end on this day. I had to bring you here. Well, I hope that's true. I still don't know what to do though. You've helped me and Dave. We're still alive and so are you. Not for much longer. Well, well, well. Lookie what we got here. That's him! He killed Sarah. Did I? Or did you? I didn't do anything. You sure? What the? Oh, shit did you just. You just... That never gets old. I don't know what the fuck you just did. Seems like we need to make this a more private affair. I've been waiting 150 years for this. It would've been sooner if we'd gotten you the last time. What do you mean the last time? You don't remember your last trip out here? Seems like you should. You flipped the raft? That was you? Surprise. Let's make this a fair fight. Give it up. It's over. You know you'll never kill an innocent person. Yes, you speak the truth. I cannot harm him. What just happened. Am I dead? You will be soon enough. No, you are still part of the world of the living. I used your body like he used his. Used my body? What does that mean? Don't be stupid, boy. You really don't know? We's kin. You're my blood, so my spirit can use you in this world. So, I was the one that killed those people? You ain't as dumb as you look, boy. And I'll get you. You can be sure of that. Just like I got your parents. You killed my parents? Is this true? Again, he speaks the truth. I won't let you get away with it. I already have. And there ain't nothing you can do about it. Unless you wanna kill him. Right now. If you kill him right now then your parents go free. Your relatives go free, everyone! Go on. Do it. Go on! No. I won't do it. I won't spill innocent blood. That's not my way. Didn't think so. I think it's time for everyone to leave. We'll pick this up a little later. So, if I kill her, we win? Well, well, well. Look who's growing himself some balls. Yeah. If you kill her right now, we win. We get to leave this world. If she kills me, they win? You better not get killed by no girl, boy. That's right. All my life people have been telling me what to do. And I'm gonna do what I want. Two Rivers: I cannot help. You must defend yourself. Kyle, listen to me. You don't have to do this. We can figure something out. There's nothing to figure out. - I'm so sorry. - Stop. It'll all be over soon. You're not so innocent now. No! What have you done? I sent you to hell. My vision has come to pass. And you have proven yourself worthy. We can join our ancestors in peace, and when you are ready they'll be a place of honor for you there. Can you take me home? - Hey. - Hey, there you are. I was wondering when you were gonna get up. Are you feeling any better? Feeling better? Yeah, you were sick in your room all weekend. All weekend? Yeah. I heard you coughing. Don't you remember? Not really. Maybe I took too much medicine. Yeah, done that before. Makes you feel all loopy. Oh, um, Chief stopped by earlier. He did, what'd he say? Oh, he was just checking in on you. Wanted to see how you were doing. He said to give him a call when you get up. Okay, I'm gonna take a shower first. There you go, girl. That'll make you feel a lot better. A crazy dream. Can you like move away from him? I do, don't you think it would look better? It's backwards. I getting it, I'm picking up the talking. Oh, I see. - Yeah, okay. - Yeah, that's not right. Do you wanna get closer or this good? That's good right there.
