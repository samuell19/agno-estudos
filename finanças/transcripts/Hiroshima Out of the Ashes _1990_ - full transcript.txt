Forward! Forward! Forward! Other side. Forward! Forward! Attack! Forward! Forward! Forward! Other side! Forward! Forward, forward, stop! Why are you smiling country boy? You think this is a game? Attack! Hjah! Now you country boy. He's an American. Kill him or he will kill you. Don't hold back. Attack. Harder! Harder! Harder! Hjah! Good, again. Thank you for not holding back, country boy. Americans are on their way. Are you ready for them? Be ready! Get those shades. This time we got movies. Lights, sit down. I'll keep this short, so pay close attention. Take off's at 0900. Our flight plan takes us over Iwo Jima. To our IP, the Bungo Narrows, across the inland sea to Hiroshima Bay. Our target gentleman, the city of Hiroshima. Hiroshima? This mission's a little different. We're flying solo, no escort this time, so gunners stay on your toes. Hopefully, we'll avoid any enemy fighters. But I'll tell you this, we'll probably catch a hell of lot of flack. Now before the war, Hiroshima was a cultural and religious center, population 350,000. The peacetime economy has now been adapted to the Japanese war machine. Naval shipyard, munitions factories, major military installations, all of Japan's steel. We're targeting Hiroshima castle in the center of the city. Hey, I thought we were gonna hit Tokyo. Japanese divisional headquarters for any of those of you who might be interested. We deliver our load and then we head home. Lights. Any questions? I'm sure you all know that we have a new crew member. Stand up Reese. I was just afraid this war would be over before I got a chance, you know, to really do my bit. There's plenty of war to go around. - Yeah. - Yeah. Special briefing bombadier, navigator, the rest of you guys, don't get sunburned. You're a healthy woman, Mrs. Tokawa. I'm very fat. Can anyone get fat in Japan today. But perhaps Mrs. Tokawa is sent special food packages from her family in the United States. If I am, the package would never get past the military police. Maybe we should check them. There's no word of Shawagi? He was on Iwo Jima and the reports of the casualties from there are very high. Can anyone consider their life wasted when it is given in the service of the Emperor? You fight a very brave war with slogans, Dr. Hara. I'll be outside. Please remember me to your father-in-law. Thank you. When the American troops come crashing ashore, and you know they're coming, where do you think her sympathies will lie? Izumi, when your mother and father are fighting, who do you want to win? Amen. Amen. Tachi, you still don't know the proper responses. No Father. It sounds as if you're just uttering nonsense, it's distracting to me. And offensive to God. Learn the Latin. Until you do, say nothing, hmmm? You clean up. Yes father. What have you been saying? The town's on the main road from Tokyo to Kyoto, Thank you. Father? Yes, what is this? Ashes, ashes of my grandson. He died training to be a soldier. Why have you brought this to me? For your blessing, Father. So your grandson was a Catholic? If he had lived, who knows. You may certainly pray for the repose of his soul. He was such a good, kind boy. There's nothing I can do. She raised the boy herself. The law of the church is clear, Brother Shiro. But spirit? You have my report? May I ask once again whether it can wait until tomorrow? Father General in Berlin is still quite particular, about the updates, so I shall expect you back tomorrow afternoon? Yes sir, can I take that for you? Yes. The Americans are making their morning run. Lately it's morning, and night. Open Bombay doors. Over target area, two degrees right, axis of attack 242 and holding. How long til drop? I have acquired target, synchronize release point in five four three two one. Now. Let's get the hell out of here. Feels like we're flying 3,000 miles to deliver newspapers. Bonsai. We're coming into flack. Chief what happened? Engine three's been hit, losing oil pressure. The left wing is gone! Mayday Mayday Mayday! Fire on the starboard engine! I can't control it anymore. You still want to go to Tokyo? Bail out! I think I'm gonna be sick. Bail out, everybody out! This bridge's coming apart! See you guys on deck. Remember to arch and don't open until you get to 10,000 feet. How will I know when it's 10,000 feet? When you wet yourself, let's go! Hey wait a minute. Okay, I surrender. You understand? I'll wait for you. Mrs. Todawa? Yes. This is your house? Yes. Come with me. Today, the Americans again dropped their poison paper, did you pick up a leaflet? You know I did. And you know that it is strictly forbidden. I threw it away. We cannot allow our visiting aliens to treat our laws with such contempt. I have no defense. To preserve your soldier husband's good name and to protect his child that you are carrying, it has been decided to give you a warning. If there is one more such criminal act, you will be imprisoned immediately. Mrs. Todawa, yours. You still receive many letters through the Red Cross. What does my mother say? These Americans still think they will win the war. What do you think? I am a woman. I have no opinion. We have spoken with your doctors. If it is necessary to intern you, the government will take responsibility for the child. I will not be separated from my baby. Don't try to take my baby away. Pow pow! Ha, bom bom bom! Auntie, can I come see you in prison? Sure you can partner. Maybe you can even help me break out. Masa, don't say such things. How can I help? I've done all that needs to be done. You found some flour? I made some flour. I ground acorns. My bread may not suit your refined taste, but it might keep us from starving. Do you and I have to fight the war every day in this house? Shogi wanted us to be friends. Don't speak of my brother. My husband. Who was killed by Americans. Don't say that! We don't know. You'd rather be interned in wonderful California than be free in Hiroshima with us. Grandpa! Oh Masa. Mom and Auntie have been fighting again. Again? All the time, eh? Mom and Auntie are both women, you know women, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. I'm sorry. You two never change. Come now look Seiko, look, I picked today this special just for you. You bring this house so much peace, happiness. I remember how I would come home from work anxious to see your smile. Now I come home everyday fighting, complaint, argument, but not their fault, nobody fault, must blame everything on this stupid war. Pong pong Grandpa. Masa. Masa, come sit by Grandpa. I think now good time to remember your Grandma favorite prayer, mmm? There can be no sickness like hate, no gift like health, no faith like trust, no joy like peace. Hey, close the curtain! Hurry up. Close the door. You freeze, no lights! You know there's a black out. We are taking the sacrament to a dying woman. You are in Japan. We are still fighting the war. Put it out. Why are you out in this district? German church is in Noboricho. Yes, the main church, but we come from the novitiate in the valley, near Nagatsuke. Don't use that lantern again. No sir. That man just doesn't like foreigners. Father? Yes. Does everybody speak the same language in heaven? I don't know. Hey. Hey! Take it easy, whoa, take it easy easy easy! Mama? You are very tired. You stay here and get to bed. Mama no. Yoshi? I wanna go with you to honor Papa. You are as stubborn as he was. Toyo, I'm doing this wrong. Do you want to rest? No, just a little tired. I'm not sleeping very well. Bad dreams about Shogi. Do you remember on our honeymoon-- Of course, it was me who made the arrangements. You went to Kamakura shrine. I heard that the goddess of that shrine becomes jealous of a newlywed couple who visit her together. Either the husband or the wife will soon die. That's superstition. Yes I suppose. But I wish we hadn't gone. Toyo, if they do put me in prison, help me to keep my baby. Prison is no place for a child. I can take care of her. My brother's baby will have proper attention. Howdy partner. Hi. Mama. That boy brought this for you. It's from peasant Katiko, the youngest girl is very sick. Please trust me with Masa. It's a long ride on the trolley and the child has an infection. I'll be home early to prepare dinner for Yoro. Sit down. What? Sit down! Hey, what are you doing? This man needs medical attention, do you understand me? He should be transferred to a hospital immediately. Ignore it. Ignore the siren? Such advice from a senior air raid warden. It's just the weather plane. Always obey your air raid warden. Akira, wait for me. Get in formation Yoshi. Where are you taking them? Are you taking me to Tokyo? Why am I being separated from my men? I demand to stay here in Hiroshima with my men! I'm never going to see my men again, am I? Give it. It's mine. Sorry. Give it Yoshi. What's this? Soldiers must be dedicated and sacrifice all to the country and Emperor. Soldiers shall always act in a noble and obedient manner. Soldiers shall be strong and brave at all times. Soldiers must be pure and always maintain faith. Concentrate, sit up straight, close your eyes and unite. Look Yoshi, it's just one B-29. Yoshi. Izumi! Sachiko, Sachiko over here! Are you hurt? No no! I waited for the sirens. I want to stay with you. I want you out of the city. Please, I want to stay with you! They'll come back. But you're my husband. Go to your mother's! I will leave you Satchiko. Father. Father. Father Siemes. Are you hurt Father? What? No, not seriously, but-- Are you, either of you? No Father. No Father. Good. That was close. Well get your brooms. We've got cleaning to do. Yes Father. Yes Father. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! What about the others? They're dead Reese. There's nothing we can do. Reese, hold it together. You're an airman. This is the war you wanted. Stay close. Why is it night already? I don't know Masa. I'm thirsty. Thirsty? My face hurts. Let me see. Where's Mama? I don't know. She'll be home soon, though. Why don't we clean up the house before she gets home, okay? I feel hot, Aunt Sally. I have a cream that'll take the sting out. Wait here, okay? - Lieutenant, Lieutenant, - Let's go. O'Neal's on fire. Throw him down, throw him down! Okay, let's go. Why is it so dark all of a sudden? Over there, over there. It's a cesspool. Get in, get in. You're okay. I got him, I got him. I got him. Ahhh! Partner, where does this one go? This is easy. Mama? Toyo? Water, if I may ask. Mama. My notebook. I told my mother-- Help me, Father. Yes, I'll come. I'll take care of everybody. Very good. We must go into the city and inquire after Brother Shiro and Father Superior. We'll take care of everyone. Get the cart ready. We'll have to go to the main church as soon as we can. Excuse me Father. Yes? May I have some water, please. Water, Kanji. Thank you Father. Kanji. Yes Father. Kanji, help, please help. Take care, take care of him. Sensei? Yes. Please could you help me? In a moment. I feel sick sensei. Why don't you sit down, sit down and I'll come as soon as I can. Alright? A soldier must be dedicated and sacrifice all to the country and Emperor. A solder shall be strong and brave at all times. Yoshi, be brave. Black rain. What are you staring at, country boy? Come help me with the cart. Yes, teacher. We must find some water. Now, what seems to be the problem? Why? Why? I'm so sorry. No it's not my son. My Akira is much smaller. Your boy Akira is my son's best friend. Mrs. Kawamoto? Please help me. How many burned victims doctor? What happened, doctor? Dr. Hara. All these people. And more keep coming by the minute. All our medicines have been destroyed or used, supplies or gauze or disinfectant have already been exhausted. Even the dressings for the burns are running out. Only cooking oil remains. We must arrange to have these patients transferred to the Red Cross hospital, Shima Medical Center. All destroyed. I'll speak with Dr. Fujita. Where is he? Is he injured? He's not-- There were hundreds of fragments of glass. I did what I could. Dr. Fujita's microscope destroyed. Doctor, they need you out there. What does Dr. Hiro recommend? Dr. Tuwosawak? Dr. Ogawa? You are the only doctor here. No, this is impossible. We do what we can. I was running away from the flames when I saw a dead baby lying in the ruins of a house. Not far away was the mother. Her back had been broken and she could not move. I did not want to stop, but she was screaming for her child, so I picked up the baby and put it in her arms. The mother died almost immediately. I continued towards the river. Suddenly, one of the large walls of a building collapsed in flames in front of me. If I had not stopped for the mother and child, I would have been crushed. It was their deaths that saved my life. Sleep if you can. Reese, we can't stay here. I feel like my mouth's on fire. Okay well let's go find some water. Come on, buddy. Give me a hand with him. What's wrong? He's dead. What are we gonna do? We have to move on. Let's get out of here. Let's go! There's only you and me now. Let's go. Papa! You're safe! Papa, are you okay? She went into the city and she hasn't come home yet. Masa's sleeping. Papa are you okay? Do you want a massage? You want some tea? Oh Seiko. Papa, I'm so glad you're safe. Do you want some tea? Papa? I'm sorry. I'm sorry today no flower. I haven't failed to now. Papa. Papa. I need your help. Papa. Stop you're hitting children, stop! Stop, do not shoot. Father they think you're an American. Father wait! Stop, do not shoot! - He's a German priest! - Friends we are here to help! They are not Americans. Go forward. Father, I think we should return to the chapel and pray. Why don't you put this pitcher in the handcart and go back. I'll find Brother Shiro. I won't desert you Father. What? What is it? Maybe it's cramps. Here, sit down, and put your feet up, breath normal and relax. That's what I used to do in track. What's that? They're blind. Boy boy boy! Here, here, help me! Please, you're hurting yourself. Akira, Akira! - I'm so sorry. - No it's not him. All my family gone. I'm the lucky one. I was visiting my Auntie in Gorchu, I wanted to take Akira with me, but he didn't want to miss school. You know, our boys may not have been here. Yesterday Yoshi told me that half the students were sent up to build fire breaks. Akira take his shovel. Yoshi may have gone home. With your home destroyed, Akira may have gone with him. Can I come with you? I would like you to. Let us pray for our brothers. Hello, can we help? No wait, don't run away, we won't hurt you. I'm Father Siemes and this is Kanji and Goro. What does it say? Father Mother, we are alive. Gezu and Wakako. Which one of you is Gezu? Which one of you is Wakako? I am. Oh hello, then you must be Gezu. Would you like to come with us? We live in the country, you would be safe there. No. No? Oh, are you hungry? Come with me, we'll take care of your eye. Maybe if we helped you hang your sign, then we could write that you are with us and your mother and father would know where to find you. It's not far, I promise. Can we ride in your car? Yes of course, come on. I treated a woman with the pattern of her dress burned into her skin. I also saw shadows of trees engraved onto stone. Please forgive me for having no burdens like yours. Doctor, you need to rest. The nurse will finish up here. Each one tells me their story, where they were when the bomb fell, how many in their family have died. Please go to Dr. Fujita's office. I'll find some rice. Dr. Hara, I know how busy you are, but please, can I ask you to examine my son? Of course, what is the matter? He has no strength, he eats so little and what he eats, he loses. Seiji, how are you? What happened doctor? We don't know. All the military tells us is they believe a new type of bomb was used. One bomb? You've no burns or cuts. I escaped the building before it collapsed. Where were you at the time the bomb fell? Near Yokogawa bridge. The army says the center of impact was Shima Hospital, less than a kilometer from where you were. Tomorrow, I'll try to get up. No no no, stay with us. Let your mother spoil you. You'll be fine, I assure you. Thank you doctor. Doctor Hara, What? A package has just arrived addressed to Dr. Fujita. What is this? It may be some medicine. Doctor, there are patients in the nurse alcove, I cannot stop the bleeding, would you mind? There is nothing to be done for them, nothing. They will die. Work with the ones who have some hope. Which are they? I don't know. Oh. Now, through this microscope, I can relate a patient's blood count to where they were when the bomb exploded. Let's see, Seiji was here, epicenter was here. Now I might discover what is causing these strange symptoms and if there is a way to heal the victims. Take it easy boy. Oh I got rid of that. You never felt a thing. Hey hey, settle yourself boy. Please sir, I must go back for the notebook. I have to keep ahold. That notebook is good luck for you boy. Will I see you again? Only if you live. Water. Water here please! It is dangerous to ignore the grandson of the last samurai. Stop stop! Stand away! These men are my prisoners! Come with me, quickly! There can be no sickness like hate, no gift like health, no faith like trust, no joy like peace. Mrs. Kamamoto? A soldier wired our station, your son's been injured. How badly is he hurt? He's been taken to a hospital. Which hospital? Military, on an island in the bay. Where? I told you what I know. We need a boat. Yoshi's on a hospital on an island, I believe my Akira's with him. And then, Imashi said to the evil samurai but I don't know how to get into the oven? The evil samurai suddenly got very angry and said oh you silly goose, it's simple. I'll show you. And as the evil samurai bent over to show her how to get through the little door, he pushed him into the oven and then closed the door on him. Oh look at this, that's what I thought. There's a little girl under here. What happened next? Well, then Imashi hurried to her brother, Tajiro, and rescued him. And he was very happy to see her. And now that they were safe from the evil samurai, you know what they did? What? They started to eat the veseros, because you remember? It was made of gingerbread. Father? Thank you Wakako. Impossible, do you know how many islands there are in the bay? It would take days to search all of them. My son may be dying. What will you pay? Coins are useless. Sir. Follow me. There's only one guard, we can take him. It sure looks different from the air. Well they started it. So what? So what? It makes no sense. What? Why did he save us? Who knows? If the Japs bombed New York City and I see a couple of enemy soldiers walking down what's left of 34th Street, I know what I'm gonna do. It's your favorite Mssa. I put some ginger in it. Just one bite? Mama! Masa! My Masa. Where were you Mama? Mama was lost. There are no streets anymore. I didn't know where I was. Ottosan? What the Americans did! Ottosan, why? Why? Toyo, I have some cream for your burns in my room. Your room? All these little hemmorages, most of our patients have them. It was the poison that was dropped. Everyone breathed the poison. Doctor, may I speak to you a moment. Over at the department, they have electricity now, a radio. They say a mysterious weapon has been used to bomb Nagasaki. Nagasaki? It's the same as here. A young navy man was listening with me. He heard the Americans are using an atomic bomb. It's radiation sickness. I never heard of it. Yes because until now it was very rare. Only occasional overexposure to x-ray. The military also says we have dropped such a bomb on New York and Washington. Haven't enough people been injured? Haven't enough lives been lost? It's useless. Please, I cannot give up now. No one knows where this hospital island is. Tomorrow we'll look again. We'll find some way to pay. If you want to go on with the search, go ahead, without me. Little samurai, what is it? I lost Akira's notebook. I made a promise. It is good to cry over this. I would cry over this too when I was your age. Of course that leaves you only one course of action. What? We must find Akira's mother and tell her of Akira's intention of giving her the notebook. No. That way, you've fulfilled the spirit of your friend's wishes. Between friends, it is not the deed that is truly remembered, but the spirit that made the deed possible. Do you understand? Akira's mother will know her son's last desire was to please her. A mother would enjoy knowing that, I think, much more than possessing some notebook and only you can give her that. Toyo? It's only a little bit. I don't want food. I feel terrible. Do I look terrible? I can see it in Masa's face. Poor Mama. Let me have a comb, please. And a mirror. Once, I wanted to look like an American movie star, Ginger Rogers, a blonde. Papa found the peroxide and burned all the movie magazines. For me it was Carole Lombard. Toyo, Toyo stop. Please stop Leave me alone, leave me alone, get out, leave me alone! I'm sorry. Excuse me doctor. The Emperor is about to speak. All listeners please rise. His majesty the Emperor will now read his imperial rescript to the people of Japan. We respectfully submit his voice. Despite the best that has been done by everyone, the war situation has changed to Japan's disadvantage. Moreover, the enemy have begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power which to do damage is incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. For these reasons, we have ordered the acceptance of the surrender terms today. The hardships and sufferings to which our nation will subject to hereafter will certainly be great, however, it is according to the dictate of time and fate that have we have resolved to pave the way for grand peace for generations to come by enduring the unendurable and suffering the insufferable. Hey, on your feet. I'm moving you to a camp for prisoners. He needs a doctor. I'm telling you he needs a doctor. Japan has surrendered. What? You will join other Americans. Pete, Pete, did you hear that? We are going home, we've won. We're going home. Tojo! Where are we going? Where's the hospital? Pull over. Do you hear me, pull over. This man's dying dammit, he needs a doctor. Listen to me! The war is over, you people surrendered and you guys lost. Now you get him to a doctor now. You out now! What are you gonna do? You're not gonna kill me, are you? Walk! Listen, killing me isn't going to prove anything. Kill you? I want you to live. Turn around. I want you to see what one bomb did to my city. Go back to your people and tell them, this must never happen again. Enough killing. No, you're not my enemy. War is our enemy. Mr. Tanako was here, now anyone within this perimeter was instantly-- Mrs. Seiki. Dr. Hara. Fujicha, the best tea. Enjoy it. So you see, the closer a person was to the point of impact, the lower his blood count, and the less his chance of survival. Now you know who will recover. Yes to some extent, but what we don't know is the effect the radiation will have on us for the rest of our lives, maybe even the lives of our children. Dr. Hara, Captain Fuguta, military police. I brought two very sick prisoners. They were in Hiroshima Castle when the bomb fell. Yes, we're very crowded, but bring them in. They are Americans. No! There's no room for Americans in this hospital. Doctor! Dr Fujita once told me, medicine is the art of compassion. Tom? I'm right here. Hell of a way to end a war. Yeah, maybe you'll see more in the next one. You hang on. Doc's coming. They must've thought dropping paper wasn't doing the trick. You got that right. Just hold on Pete. It's you and me. Dr. Hara will examine your friend. There was nothing you could've done. Thank you. Hi guys. Looks like you'll have to get better without me. Where are you going? The Americans are coming, occupation forces, everybody's scared. Not me. They've disbanded the army, so I'm going to look for my family in Kawasima. Your arm is getting better. The doctor was going to amputate. I told them, this boy needs both arms if he's going to work for the future of this country. Hiah. Sergeant, I want to go home, they say no. It will be a very long swim, even for a strong boy like you. Goodbye Sergeant. Take care of that arm. Some day I hope to see you pitch a perfect game. Now that is something American I do like. And the next one. Father, Mrs Sato's here. Oh. Wakako, Mrs Sato is accompanying you to your new home. If your relatives are looking for you, they'll got to this place where she's taking you, you see? Can we stay here with you? Please? I promise I'll visit and I make a very good promise. Mrs Sato, I know he was not a Catholic, but I think we'll say a mass for your grandson. Maybe we ought to do it in Japanese. Mama! Mama! Yoshi! Akira? This is Akira's mother. My son? I'm sorry Mrs Ota. Akira died in our classroom. His last wish for you to have his notebook of drawings, but I was not worthy. I lost it. I dishonored our friendship. My son has a very good friend. Your labor has started. You should go to the hospital now. Masa will stay with me. Go on Sally. Out of the way! You speak English? I should, I was born in California, Oceanside. You're a long way from home. Maybe you can help us. We're looking for the communication center, Dr. Hara? Maybe we can help each other. It's a girl. Is she alright? Well she has all her fingers and toes. See for yourself. Excuse me, Dr. Hara, the American radiologists are still waiting to talk to you. Yes I know. What should I say to them? There is a haiku, you can say to them, now that my house has burned down, I have a much better view of the moon.
