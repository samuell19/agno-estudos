Father! Father! To sleep... to die... No, to sleep! Perchance to dream! There's the rub! To be, or not to be: That is the question... Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer... The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune... Or to take arms against a sea of troubles... And by opposing end them? To die, to sleep... No more! And by a sleep... - And by a sleep to say we end... - Father... - Father... - That's strange... The ones returning from war... ...usually have the names of women on their lips. This one's got nothing better on his mind than calling for his father. Right. And who knows if he even has a father. I mean a real father. Who fosters and protects you, who gives you a home. I don't think he has a father like that. Otherwise, he wouldn't be sleeping under the wagon of some performers. Ah, war only harms. And you? Have you learned this damned role already? I'm rehearsing it right now! Listen, if you blow your lines tonight I'll cut your meals! Hey! Soldier. Wake up. You've been sleeping since last evening. Where are you from? Who are you? Don't you want to tell me? A secret... You're strange. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time. The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely... The pangs of despised love... The pangs of despised love! For who would bear the whips and scorns of time... Why did he shoot? I don't get it... Who are they? That's Butch Warren, isn't it? - And what did he want from us? - Those rogues hardly rode that far... ...just to rob some poor performers. Thank God, that soldier is a good shot! - Thanks a lot, anyway... - Look, he's leaving! Now what? You're running off? Hey hero! JOHNNY HAMLET Hey. There... The dream didn't fool me. "Willfully murdered". But who did it? Who? Maybe someone he hated. Relative of yours? My father. All the tears on earth aren't enough to cry for a man like you. And me? Why wasn't I here? Where was I when they killed you? So far away from my home, from my land... for such a long time. Defending a flag, a piece of honorable cloth. Instead of protecting my father, my own flesh, my own blood! Did he call my name in that very moment? Like in that dream? A good man, Hamilton. A man of honor. Hey! Watch out, gravedigger! If you soil my shoes, I'll make you clean them with your tongue. And try not to make any noise when you dig! Can't you see, you're disturbing the pious souls who come here to pray? Am I right, Ross? Hey General! What are you doing here? Are you looking for a grave? Huh? Yours? I have to warn you, my friend doesn't like uniforms that much. Am I right, Guild? Even worse! An uniform like this one could make me angry... ...like the red rag to a bull. Ol?, toro! Hey Guild. What do you think about those heros... ...who instead of dying on the battlefield... ...end up on the cemetery, draped with medals? Huh? Hey you, gravedigger! Come on, let's go! Dig a grave... for this heroic general! I'll take care... of the corpse. Hey! What should we engrave on the tombstone? You've laughed three times already, my friend. The next laugher could be your last. Don't you see that I'm trembling with fear? Damn it, I've never seen you shaking like this! Get lost, you two! I don't like talking to someone who shoots from behind. You're right, Ross. My father used to say... ...amateurs never confront you with the muzzle. Then get lost quick before I... get to the professional part. Very good, yes. Make a nice face. Hey, no! Not on the grip... It's more hygienic on the barrel. Exactly! Very good... Hey you! Get out! Can't you see that they're two good boys? Too bad... That was a wine that could have awoken the dead. That's what they say. Until next time, my friend. - We'll see each other again. - Whenever you like. Thanks, Horaz. You're welcome, Johnny. You always show up in the right moment. Like back then, when I was a little boy. You've become a man, Johnny. And you seem to be alright. It was about time for you to come back. I need your help. I want to know who killed my father. - And you have to tell me. - I don't know. I was told, it was Santana. That's what they said. But I... ...I don't know. They also said your uncle avenged him. Santana lies over there. I wouldn't have even wasted a grave for a bandit like him. And my mother? She suffered. She's still on the ranch. Gertie! Are you over there? What are you doing? I'm there in a minute. Satisfied with the party? Ah, good. You're an outstanding landlady. What? No, fool! Come here! I command you to! The wife has to obey the husband! And if she doesn't listen... ...the husband beats her up! - No! I obey! I obey! Oh sweetheart... Who's there? Johnny! Johnny! Oh Johnny... Two years... Two years of that horrible war. Why did you marry my uncle? Do you know what happened to your father? When they killed him, I felt like I had to die of pain. A short pain. You didn't let his bed cool down! You mustn't talk to me like this! That's true. You're the landlady here. You're the wife of your husband's brother. And you're still... my mother. Yes... your mother. But Johnny, you're not a little boy anymore. And I'm a woman. And so alone. If your uncle hadn't been there... ...they would have taken everything away. Do you understand? Everything! Sure, sure. So... uncle Claude saved everything. And in exchange, took everything for himself. Yes... - Also the caresses of my mother! - Johnny! You're embittered of pain. Why don't you want to understand me? Your mother is right. Johnny! Welcome home. Johnny! Hello, Johnny! For how long have I been waiting for you? Too long. Don't talk now. Emily... What are you doing? Emily! You shouldn't have left, Johnny. You shouldn't have left me. But now... Now I'm here. And everything will be the way it used to be. A lot has happened. Lots of bad things. And nothing could be the way it was. What do you know? What can you tell me about my father? Don't ask me, Johnny. I'm begging you. I don't want to talk about it. And it's also better for you. But I have to. Did you tell your father that I'm back? No, Johnny! I'm also not the same person I was back then anymore. - That's enough! - Johnny! - Tell me what happened! - No! I want to know what they have done to you! - Johnny, go! - Come on, talk! Tell me who killed my father! - Save yourself, Johnny! Go away! - What do you know? What did you see? - No, I don't know anything. - Talk! I don't know anything, Johnny! - Talk! - Hey General! Is that the way you treat the sheriff's daughter? Her father's the sheriff now. And you're asking that girl too many questions. How can you demand that she answers you? - If she can't answer... - Go, Johnny. ...somebody else will answer my questions. - Is that so? - Go! But that wouldn't be good for you. Did you see, my lovely? You've been warned. These are dangerous acquaintances. Even for the daughter of the sheriff. Want some help? Whoops! Get up! Ol?! That's for you! Come on! Let's go! Stop it! Get lost, you two! It went well for today. - Until next time. - And watch out... - Next time will be the last time! - If it's the last time... ...I'd hate to miss it. Let me know where. So this must be the keeper of order. But he rather calls out for order than keeping it. Don't provoke me! And keep in mind: I'm representing the law around here. Well... and the criminals elected you sheriff. I don't think there's someone else in this world... ...who started out as low as you did... ...and succeeded in going even lower. Fine, you'll pay for that, too. And when it comes to you, Johnny, my daughter's already told you... ...that she doesn't want you around her anymore. Go away from here, before it's too late. - My return seems to bother everybody. - Well... Listen... This might interest you. I kept it for you. It lay next to your father's corpse. Someone said it's the signature of his murderer. Of Santana? If it belongs to him - it belongs to him. Horaz... I must know... Must know why Santana killed my father! If Santana really did it. Six times the bull's eye. You're relying too much on your skills. Now your gun is... empty. And you, Johnny... ...rely too much on the appearance. There could always be someone who's been making precautions. And it's... the last shot that counts. When you expect it the least... ...you meet someone who's quicker and smarter. My father... must have met someone like that. Don't you think? But I doubt that Santana was quicker than my father. Even more so: I refuse to believe it. And what are you trying to say by that? Someone like Santana doesn't act without an intention. What reason did he have to kill my father? Listen... This is a very dirty story. And I wouldn't want to be the one to tell you. I want to know. The war had also changed your father. - Come on, keep talking. - As you wish. When the south was about to lose... ...the townsfolk here in Texas... ...collected a contribution of 300,000 dollars. Only your father knew the transportation route. But instead... ...Santana attacked the convoy. Don't you think that's strange? Don't stop. He killed the escort, but he didn't find any gold. And then he went to your father. Don't spit on his grave! These are facts. I don't want to know what kind of relationship these two had. But as I heard that Santana killed your father - ...don't forget that he was my brother - ...I avenged him! Santana was a bandit. And I butchered him like a dog. Everybody in this colony who has a feeling for honor and justice... ...agreed with me. And what happened to the 300,000 dollars? Everbody who knew is dead. Santana. My father. But this gold is missing. Well... Whoever did that job, did a good one. After all, Horaz, the world's a less awful place... ...if you look at it through a glass. And that's one more reason for always keeping it full. Cheers. My father... He always lived a righteous life... ...to finish it with a disgraceful death. Nobody chooses... his death. The life... that's what you have to choose. And it's a difficult choice. - Landing! We're there! - Are we stopping here? Finally! We'll stay in a guesthouse for a night! Unload everything and make sure that you don't beat a drum! Et voila. Who are you? You're dead. A no-good, that's what you are! Couldn't you have dug out your witty jokes... ...on stage in Denver? They wouldn't have kicked us out of the theater then. - I already sent you packing twice! - I only do pantomime! Just get lost with the amateur who always blows his lines... ...on "to be or not to be"! - And Ophelia? She always goes with everybody. Only in Denver... ...she had to play the picky one with that judge! The boos were directed at her, not on me! Also on you, windbag, also on you! I go to bed alone. Hey soldier! Who had ever imagined to meet you here? Have you gone mad? You've hurt me! - Who gave that to you? - Why? Are you jealous? - I want to know where you got it from. - Ah, I don't know. About a month ago. From a Mexican with a dark voice. A really handsome man. - The name! - I can't remember. He had a big belt full of those tiny things. And then I ripped some off. - And if it doesn't go well? - Come on, what are you afraid of? Someone who's been buried for two years doesn't walk around... ...and gives earrings to actresses. - Did you hear me, gravedigger? - But I don't account for it. If the girl told the truth, then this grave is empty. - Empty? - Come on, dig! For 100 dollars I'll dig as far as hell! 5 to take them six feet under and 100 to bring them back. - We're there. - Open up. Stinks even worse than the other killers' corpses. Right, Mister? It's a damn shame, letting this here rot next to the worms. That thing is worth something! Bury him again. Johnny. What are you doing here? Are you ransacking the graves? Why are you watching me? It appears to me that you're beginning to overdo it. You're acting like a jackal. You're snooping around everywhere just like a dirty, hungry dog... ...and you insult everyone with your suspicions. What the hell are you looking for? I wanted to look in the face of my father's murderer. In the face! Do you understand? In the face! Johnny! I did what I could for your father. And I couldn't save him. But if you still don't believe me... Shoot! Don't you think your mother suffered enough? Hey Guild. Look, who's coming. Jump, donkey! Jump! Well, was it of use for you? Have you been in the cemetery? What was in the coffin? Santana. Nevertheless, I don't believe that two different Mexicans are running around here... ...collecting and giving away the same little things. So then, who's buried there? Not the murderer of my father. But he will end up there, too. Whoever that is. Hey... Are you running around with an empty gun? I'm loading late... ...but I'm shooting first. Hey, wake up! Oh, look... But these weren't the ones that belonged to the actress. They killed her, Horaz. Obviously, the one who had her disposed didn't want her to talk. One witness less. But he confirmed the suspicion. And he also made an even bigger mistake. He didn't manage to knock me off. He tried - and he'll do it again. Nobody is perfect in this world. You wanted this one? Yes, his! Thanks. Johnny, you must remember... ...that it once belonged to a good man. I know. Your father only used it to defend himself. And to protect us and our land. I hope that you'll do the same. Johnny, will you come back? Will you promise me that? Maybe. I don't know. Stop! Pedro! What are you looking for, amigo? - Santana. - Santana? Are you chasing phantoms, hombre? - Santana is dead. - No! I don't believe so. What is it that you don't believe? Freeze! And now you'll accompany me to the phantom. There it is. - Usually he's there, in this house. - Ah, fine. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Santana! Now I had enough of these games, boy. I just let you fool around with my men... ...because it was fun for me. Hey hombre! - Easy, man! - Stay calm, Santana. The young ones are always impulsive. You shouldn't lose your head that easily, understand? Understand what? That you robbed everything? The life of my father, the love of my mother, our land! Sometimes, pain and anger are very bad advisers. I've already told you that the war changed everything. Johnny... You have to accept these, henceforth, final events. The death of your father... ...my marriage... ...and my adherence to this land. You're blaming me for this, right? Come on, Johnny, just listen to me. Try to curb your antipathy. Life goes on. Why shouldn't the two of us become friends? Don't touch me! It doesn't help you to play this dirty comedy. There's still one thing I need to know about you. And it's something that doesn't interest only me... - Where did you take the gold? - What? Did I mishear something or did he say "gold"? Yes! The gold of the convoy. What? I think, I know where this gold ended up. Don't believe these fooleries, Santana. He's making up stories to save his skin. It doesn't make any difference to kill him here or somewhere else. You forced me to play dead for two years. You said the gold was missing! In fact, you know where it is! I want the gold, the gold! Let's go! Of what use is this fraud to you, Johnny? If Santana realizes that you've been lying... ...he's got one more reason to kill you. You lied as well. But the last shot's the one that counts. Remember, your coffin is buried in the cemetery, too! Ah, you know, gold wakes up the dead. I'm revived again! Let's go, Guild! Stop! Can you see something, Ramon? - Didn't you hear anything? - Nothing. Watch out! Everybody down! On the ground! Come here, Johnny! Damn it! Ross! Stop shooting! Go after them! Hey Guild! Come! We're off! Your uncle is strong. And maybe you revealed your cards too early. Now your life isn't worth that much anymore. And yours not more than mine. I'm sorry. It's dangerous to be my friend. I'm too curious. If I don't count my enemies, I don't have my peace. I'm coming with you. No. That's my business. And I have to sort it out by myself. Okay. We'll see each other in one way or another. If not here... ...then up there. Or down there. Goodbye, Horaz. Come on, quick! Come on, nobody saw you! Johnny's waiting for you there. Thanks! That's all. Johnny! Where are you? Johnny! It's me, Emily! I warned you. No! No! I'm begging you, no! And you couldn't keep your mouth shut. Me, no! No! That's not true! I didn't say anything. I swear! - I swear! - Shut up! - Believe me! Believe me! - I believe you. I'm even absolutely sure that you won't say anything at all anymore. No! No. No, I don't want to part with my son. - It must be done. - I don't want to lose him. You still regard him as a boy. Johnny is ungrateful, a bullhead, up for everything. - Without a touch of understanding. - He's been away for too long. Would have been better, if he'd never gotten back. He needs help. Why should I stop helping him? You promised me, with his return... Because it's not easy. I'm the man who took his mother away from him. And he won't forgive me that. Listen. If somebody is in a hopeless situation... ...he must go his own way. And the sooner he goes... the better for everyone. Gertie... it's better for everybody. If Johnny leaves me... If I can't meet him again... Forgive me, Claude... But I'll regret it for my whole life. What? What do you want? That's Johnny's! - But this was the gun of his father. - Yes, but I gave it to Johnny. - What happened to him? Where is he? - Where did you find it? - It lay next to my daughter's corpse. - No! Johnny... Emily... No. Oh no... No! That can't be true! It's absurd, it's not true! Oh no... It's not true... It is not true... No... Back again! Are we going to dig someone else out? - Half the price, 50 dollars. - No. This time for 5 dollars. And you have to dig the deepest grave of them all. And on the gravstone you'll engrave: "Claude Hamilton. Murderer of his brother." I'm always on duty. But for the digging, I need his measures. Ah, too bad. She was so young. Poor Emily. And so beautiful. I knew, he would come back here. - What are we going to do with him? - Crucify him. Vamos! Ride at gallop! Pull him up! Pull! Look! That's Santana! We better warn Mr. Claude. Barricade the gate! You there, quick! Hurry up with the cart! And you, help us! Come on! Leave it up there and get the ammo! Come on! Boss, Joe gave us a signal: Santana will be here soon! Ah, come here. Listen. Tell the men, they shouldn't show themselves. Santana! It must happen as fast as lightning. Understood? He thinks he'll surprise us. But instead... - Let everybody know! - Alright. Claude! What's up, sweetheart? - What's wrong? - Santana. You said you killed him to avenge your brother - my husband. You lied, he's alive! Why did you lie? - But Gertie... - I want to know where Johnny is! Tell me. Tell me! - Gertie, sweetheart... - What happened to him? Talk! - I'm begging you! - Who shot my husband? - I want the truth! - Listen, put the gun away. No. What are you scared of? Are you afraid of me? Talk! Who shot my husband? - Very funny, stop it! - Stop this masquerade, Claude! - You don't scare me! - What's wrong with you? - Have you gone insane? - I want the truth! Gertie, you will regret... ...what you're doing right now... - Too late! - I'm already regretting since Johnny... - Gertie! Step back, Claude! Or I'll kill you! We arrived just in time, boss. Boss! Boss! Santana is here! To the windows, you two! Move, knucklehead! Move! Attention, he's coming! Let them come closer! Come on, guys, let's go! You brave men! Folks, here are 300,000 dollars! They're ours! Go! Come on! Come on! - Attention! - Go! Back into the house! Cover the other side! Gertie? Gertie! Stop! Ramon! Go upstairs! Oh no... My son didn't do it. What are you planning to do here? It wasn't him. He loved Emily! - He didn't kill her! - He's a murderer! And he must die. Up there. Like all murderers. That's enough, sheriff! - Leave this woman alone! - And her son, too. - What do you want from them? - I thought, I told you... ...you should go out of my way! And I told you to go to hell. So leave, because he's innocent. What are you waiting for to free him? Would you like to take his place? It's reserved for you. Johnny... Johnny! Claude! Come on, get out, Claude! Damn... Ross, Guild! Santana is dead. Now we can leave as well. Get the horses ready, quick. This dirty bastard made it. But on his own, impossible... Look for him! He won't have come far. What are you doing? Are you stopping? And what about Claude? What will he say if he finds out that we stopped? Where else do you want to look for him? Someone must have given him a horse. One more reason to go on, right? What does it help to ride on, anyway - in the middle of the night? Yes, yes. You're right. Ross, I'll have a drink. Are you coming with me? Let's assume he came here and he's not alone... We better watch out, Guild. But who should have helped him? His friend? That one's even more worthless than him. I'll take a short look around. Give me a whiskey. Enjoy every sip. Because it's the last one. What are you waiting for? Drink. Ross! Stop! This fool... Do you want to end up like Guild? Come here! Are you looking for me, Ross? Damn it... Claude! 300,000 dollars, Claude! Too much for that tiny bit of life that you have left! And too little for so many dead people. Damn! And it's all gone with the wind... Very good! They're rummaging the earth... Rivaling the moles... They rob themselves... They hate themselves... They shoot... They maul themselves... And now, it's all gone with the wind. Hello folks! Nice day, isn't it? Yes! Great! - But the wind's not too shabby. - Ah, you have to be contended. But as long as there's work, there's enough of everything. It was a day like this one, Horaz. Do you remember? You taught me how to ride. And there was this voice coming out of the house: "Don't lose heart, Johnny!" - Your father. - "At Gallop!" "I want to see you run like the wind." Yes. Like the wind... Let's go, Johnny. ...15 and 16... Fine. And we only have four coffins. Right, good boy? We'll have to go on a lot of tours today! Yes, yes, yes, yes. Hey! Hey! Hey folks! If you clean up another place, remember me! The best gravdigger in Texas! The best! At gallop, Johnny! Just like the wind! THE END
