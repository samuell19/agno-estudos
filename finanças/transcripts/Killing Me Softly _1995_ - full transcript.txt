And then he looked right through me As if I wasn't there But he was there, this stranger, Singing clear and strong Strumming my pain with his fingers Singing my life with his words Killing me softly with his song Killing me softly With his song Telling my whole life With his words Killing me softly With his song Martin, I've just killed your father. Dad? Dad? Dad! Shit! Oh, shit! Accident emergency. Hello, good afternoon. I've just killed my husband. I stuck a six inch carving knife in his belly on the left-hand side. Where are you, love? Bring an ambulance and the police straight away. Where are you? I'm at 112 Blossom Lane, Stonewater, Warwickshire. My name is Mrs Sara Thornton, and my husband is called Mr Malcolm Thornton, and I think he's dead. 112 Blossom Lane, Stonewater, Warwickshire. Shall I pull the knife out, or leave it in? Leave it where it is, darling. Leave the knife in? That's right. Thank you, good night. Oh, shit. Whoops. I think the leather bits on this might shrink in the machine, don't you? He's really bad. He's alive, just. Excuse me, please. I stabbed him here, you see? Were you trying to kill him? Yes, I wanted to kill him. Pulse 120, very weak. Infusion. - Which one? - Hartmann's. He's going to need oxygen. Excuse me, will you? I've got to get a photo of this. Mrs. Thornton. Malcolm? Malcolm, Malcolm! - Mrs Thornton- -Malcolm! You cannot leave this kitchen, do you understand? We're trying to save the life of your husband. Don't know why you're bothering. Let him die. Do you understand what you're saying? I know exactly what I'm saying. I sharpened up the knife so I could kill him. You know what he's been doing to me in the last two years? When did you sharpen the knife? I said, "You coming to bed love?" And he told me to piss off out of his life and go and find some bloke who'd screw me for money. So I just walked in the kitchen, got the knife, sharpened it up, and stuck it in his belly. Had he beaten you? No. Did he threaten you? He would have. One, two, three, lift. You should be locked up. It's important that we know how you stabbed him. Which way did the knife go in? Like this. Get me my guitar, would you? All right, I'll get it. Mrs. Thornton, you clearly don't understand, do you? Your husband may die. Now, you're under arrest so either you behave yourself, or I'll have to handcuff you. Okay, okay. You only have to say "please." This sort of thing's never happened to me before. Hi, it's Sara here. Hi, Sara. Listen, I'm sorry to trouble you, but would it be possible for one of the drivers to get me a packet of fags? Oh yeah, no problem. John Player's or B&H. Okay, whatever you want. Okay, thanks love. - See you. - See you! I've got to get changed. You've got a lovely bum. Your B&H, Sara. Thanks, love. Just remember my advice, okay? Just try and keep calm. John! -Sara- -Is Malcolm going to be okay? Sara, please come and sit down. John used to work with Malcolm. Thank you. June 14th, 1989, 0400 hours. Malcolm Thornton died shortly before half past three this morning. I have to tell you that you're now under arrest on suspicion of your husband's murder. Oh my god, Malcolm. Oh no. I'll come in if he's dead. Are you sure? Sara, Malcolm, Malcolm, Sara. Now I noticed you the moment you walked in. I thought "Hello, something different about this one." They tell me the same could be said about you. Oh, pay no attention, darling. You don't know the half of it. Secret half, isn't it? Looks like someone's lucky day. What are you drinking? Cointreau and ginger, please. Jack, Cointreau and ginger. Make it a large one. I'll have a scotch. He's an ex-copper for Christ's sake. Maybe I'm going respectable in my old age. Your granddad will be pleased. You'll like him, Sweetpea. What do you want? A mother who's a nun? Why can't it just be the two of us? It'll always be you and me, baby drawers. God help the man who dares try and come between us! -Hello. -Hello. -Sorry -Excuse me! What you having? No, it's my round! What do you want? All right, I'll have a pint. Sara, I'll find a table. Hey, all right, Sara, you're looking nice tonight. So are you. What are you having? No, it's okay, I'm with someone. Can I have a pint and a Cointreau and ginger, please? Three two, three two! -Bloody brilliant! -Thank you very much. Thank you. See you later, lads. I, er, bought you one anyway. All right? Three two, three two, three two, three two We won the cup, we won the cup! No, no! All right! Just leave it, would you? The fact is, Sara, that your friend- Yes, Malcolm, my friends. I do have male friends. Sara? Malcolm. Sara look, I know you don't want to speak to me at the moment, but the thing thing is okay, Malcolm. I just want to say, look, I'm sorry. Okay, I behaved like a complete dickhead, I know that. Malcolm. The fact is that if I hadn't so spectacularly blown it, I was going to ask you and Luise -if you'd like to come over -Malcolm. -for the weekend. -Malcolm, yes. You try and stop us. - Really? - Really. Oh, well, that's great. Let's try again, shall we? Yes! Come on, we'll be late! Hello. Hello. Hiya. Malcolm, this is Luise, and Mr. Moppet. Hello, Luise. Hello Malcolm, lovely to meet you, Malcolm. Can I show you something? Go on. It's all yours. All for me? Ah. Especially pigeons. Her neighbour, Rose, like birds too. But not pigeons. Brilliant. Thanks, Malcolm. And he's doing some decorating. Do it yourself, he always said. But he's not very good at it. We're making curry! Ouch! What? Nothing. It's just funny. What is? Life. Thank you for being so kind to Luise. Listen, I've got two kids of my own. Well, they're big strapping lads now. Tell you the truth, it was you I was worried about. Since I knew you were coming, I suddenly realised what a dump I'd let this place become and I ran around, you know, lick of paint here, new lino there, and fix a wobbly table leg. Oh, they're coming, you should have seen me! They'll be at the top of the road by now! Just knocking in the last nail when the doorbell rang. Here I am. And here you are. Do you need any help? No. Oh, blimey, you've been in the wars, haven't you? You are lovely, you know that, don't you? When he was lying on the floor, I tried to take a photo of him. Thought he was just pretending, you see. Thought we'd look at the picture one day and laugh. Thank you, Joan. No more calls for the moment, please. So, would I be right in thinking this case is a bit of a one-off for you? Well, yes, indeed. Murders in this town are very few and far between, if that's what you mean. Now I have explored all the different options- Look. It's important that you understand. I never intended to kill Malcolm. I just wanted to frighten him. Why did you tell the police that you sharpened the knife? I couldn't believe it. Do you understand what I'm saying? I couldn't believe I'd stuck a knife in my husband. I didn't mean it literally. Well, the only complete defence against the charge of murder is either accident or self-defense. It would be difficult to argue that it was an accident given that you stood over your husband's body and plunged a knife at least four inches into his stomach. On the other hand, to plead self defence would also be problematic. So what we can do is to try and reduce the charge from murder to manslaughter. And that will give us the advantage that the sentence is left at the judge's discretion. So if we plead manslaughter, we would also be given two other possible defences. We could argue that you were provoked, or that your responsibility was diminished. The definition of provocation would require us to show that you acted in the heat of the moment. -Exactly, that was exactly- -But by your own account, you went into the kitchen to fetch a knife. Now that's not very sudden, I think you'll agree. For two years that man had beaten me, abused me, squandered our money. And there he is, again, drunk again, threatening to kill me again. And I stepped outside of the room for one bloody minute- Legally, we wouldn't have a leg to stand on. Sara, my advice is that we enter a defence of diminished responsibility on the grounds of mental disorder. You want to tell them I'm mad. If we can get the prosecution to reduce the charge to manslaughter, it would spare you the ordeal of public scrutiny. I want you to think of Luise too. So if life doesn't fit your legal definitions, rewrite it, is that it? Listen, I don't care what the law says. Provoked, yes I was provoked. In the heat of the moment, yes. I just wanted the misery to end, but that doesn't make me mad. Nobody's suggesting that you are. Okay. So we can proceed with diminished responsibility? I don't have much choice, do I? Auntie Billi, Auntie Billi! Hey. Oh! Oh, you're so heavy! Oh! And one-hander! -Oh! -I'm gonna do a hand stand. Okay, I'll catch you. Very good girl! I can spank you from here! Cup of tea? I don't, I don't want one. Can't tempt you to a sandwich? No. -Hi. -Hi. Sara won't be a moment. Right. Sara, I'm sorry to report that the prosecution are insisting that we, you, must stand trial for murder. Sara Elizabeth Thornton. You are charged with murdering Malcolm Thornton on June 14th, 1989. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. We're no strangers to love You know the rules, and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you what I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Mum, turn it down! Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it Morning, love! Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game, and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Welcome to your new home. Hiya. Hello, shorty. You've gotta sleep in the basement, is that all right? Come on, quickly, come on. Thank you. All right, lads? Stand back. All right Stuart, come on, out the way, Lee! Looks like it's gonna take a woman of experience to show you how to play this game. There. Andrew, where's Malcolm? Dunno. Billi, hasn't Malcolm come home? No? Malcolm? Malcolm! Shit, here we go. What are you playing at? Comes to something when a man can't have a drink in peace. Who the hell do you think you are, walking out on me? Malcolm! You like playing with the boys, don't you? You were doing your thing, I was doing mine. Yeah, so the old dog slipped his lead. There's a cab outside, are you coming home now? Opening up of exchanges between our two countries. Tony Benn? Well, I think something very important has happened. And I think one wants to distinguish between that and Mrs Thatcher's, erm, visit, I think, incidentally, Gorbachev would get a very warm welcome. And I think we'll see the effect- Someone to turn to Don't play with your food. It's Adam Mountford with the lunchtime programme on 94.8 Bill, this is Sara. Hiya. Afternoon, Halfpint. Any chance of any lunch, love? Help yourself, there's eggs in the fridge. Sara, what's happened to your face? Stupid, nothing. I turned around this morning and walked straight into a cupboard. Sweetheart. You see, that's what happens when I'm not around to look after you, innit, hey? Thanks for lunch, seeya. So. Go on. Well? What? Remember? Rather a big thing to have slipped your mind. Remember walking out on me at the pub. I remember seeing you playing pool with those two young lads. And? Nothing. Really, I'm sorry. I swear, I can't believe I did that. I swear. Where are you going? I need to think. Have you come to any conclusions? You're a bastard. I'm a bastard? Bully. I know. You hurt me. And I will never do it again. My life would be nothing without your love. I still can't believe you did it. Life is too short To play silly games I've promised myself I won't do that again It's got to be perfect It's go to be worth it Too many people take second best But I won't take anything less It's got to be perfect All right, come in, come in! Look at the two of you together! I believe it's called PFL. Meaning? Partners for life. When you bite your lip you're gonna flip your flip but I luv you When we're miles apart you still reach my heart how I luv you I just like the things you do, Mm Don't you change the things you do, Mm Only time can tell if we get on well coz I luv you All that's passed us by we can only sigh-igh-igh coz I luv you I just like the things you do Don't you change the things you do -Malcolm. -Yeah? -Come on. -All right. Come on, come to bed, come on. Come on. Ah, shit! Ah, ah! I'm sorry. I don't wanna have to lose you. I'm sorry. No. Just hold me. Would you please take the Bible in your right hand and read the oath. I swear by almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Could you tell us why you spent your early years in the Pacific area? My father was in the civil service with the British consulate. In those first 14 years of your life, would you describe your father as a loving, caring man? He was very stiff upper lip. Couldn't show emotion. What about your mother? Mummy worked very hard too, so she was quite similar. Looking back on it, did you feel they were capable of showing you affection? No. Would you say your childhood and adolescence were happy times? All I can say that my doctor put me on Valium when I was 17. Are you able to say now why it was you were taken to the doctor who prescribed Valium for you? I think because my moods were a little erratic. Did the death of your mother have any particular effect on you? No. What about your father? Did he remarry? Yes. How old was the woman he married, in relation to him? 20 years younger. You were first married when you were about 23, weren't you? Yes. By that marriage, did you have your child? Is it Louise or Louisa? Luise. Was that a happy marriage? To begin with, yes. But did things change as time went on? Yes. What was the principal difficulty in the marriage? My husband went to south America and when I followed him with Luise three months later, he started drinking very heavily. What happened after that? I divorced him. How old were you when you went to Millfield School? I was 15 and a half, I think. You were obviously a successful pupil. You passed a number of O and A levels? Yes. What did you get? Do you want me to list them all? Oh, not the subject, but how many Os, how many A's. Seven Os, three A's. And you left school at about 18? Yes. What happened then? I had a series of jobs. I worked as a pub cook for a while. It was part time work mainly. Well, you were rather overqualified, if I may say so, with seven O levels and three As. I think we'll adjourn now. Members of the jury. I'd like to say something. I'd like to admit and apologise. During lunch, I was thinking I lied, and I should not have done. I lied about passing my O levels and A levels. Were are you at Millfield school at all? Yes, I was. But what was the purpose of telling those lies to the jury? I've always felt ashamed about going to such a good school and not having done as well as I should have done. Mummy says can we go home now? It was great, slinging scotch down his neck. Malcolm, Mummy says- Mummy says, Mummy says. Just tell her I'm busy. She's soaked. Take us home, and then I can get her changed and into a hot bath. When I'm ready. Now, Malcolm! Otherwise it'll be four more pints and pneumonia will have set in. Will you stop buzzing round me like a blue-arsed fly, woman? Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! She needs to be taken home now. I don't mean to be funny, but isn't that our security manager? I don't know, but whoever it is, he's off his head! Listen friend, I don't think that company will be too amused to see one of their security stuff done for breaking and entering company cars. Especially in the staff car park. I know you, you're a bastard! Why don't we take a stroll, eh? Well, I don't know what we're going to do with him, but we can't leave him here, that's all. Thornton! Where the bloody hell do you live? Is that Mrs. Thornton? Stay there. All right. Come on, Malcolm, get inside. Mummy! Mum! Mum! Mum, Mum! Mummy! Why didn't you leave him then? Because I loved him. Did you not love your daughter? Yes. Was the fact that you might be injured or killed by this man in a drunken rage and leave your daughter an orphan, not a greater consideration than your own affection for him? No. Why not? I don't know why not. I just loved him. I can't keep patching him up, Sara. There are no magic potions for Malcolm's predicament. The man's an alcoholic. He needs specialist treatment. He needs to learn that only he can save himself now. I'd like to book him into a clinic before the end of the week. God knows I've let myself down along the way and abused your trust on too many occasions. But I'm facing up to my responsibilities, and I'm beginning to come to terms with my guilt. The object of this course is for it to work for life, and that is my ambition, Sara. If I can ever make up the past to you love, I will. I pray that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Malcolm! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home. I'm home. It's got to be worth it Too many people take second best But I won't take anything less It's got to be perfect It's got to be, yeah, perfect What are you saying? It's a traditional Saudi greeting the husband makes to his new wife. It means you so much as look at another man now, may Allah strike you dead. What was that? It's what they say what I come from. It means man was made to pleasure woman. Now go forth and get to it. Clearly, when you decided to marry things were improving. Yes. I was taken on by Ashnorton's and Malcolm then lost his job there. I know that was really difficult for him. But then he began running the electrical shop, and everything seemed to get a lot better again. It's great. I'm going to make it work, Sara. I know you are. Always wise to celebrate a sunny day, don't you find? Never know when the next one's going to come along. Come on girls, food. Come on. -That's it. -There you go. You want some salad, darling? Ah, you'll be all right. Oh, come on. Daft cow, giving me that Mother Teresa teetotal crap. Have a drink. April, Laura, come along girls. Let's get our things together, shall we? No, no, please don't go. Well, it's getting a little late. Right, well, I'll see you out then. No, please, stay where you are. Say thank you, girls, for a really lovely day. Thank you. And say bye bye to Luise. Bye, Luise. See you Monday, Luise. We'll see ourselves out. Off you go. Thank you very much, dear. Take care of yourself, won't you? You bastard! Sorry, what was that, love? How could you do that to Luise? Oh, you're off again, are you? Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak! Well, I'm off to the pub. No! I hate you! You fucking bitch! Mum, Mum, Mum! Mum, Mummy! Mum, Mum! Are you sure you understand the gravity of pressing charges? Yes, I'm sure. Right. Then it might be advisable if you could find somewhere to stay outside of Stonewater until we can sort this out. All right, Dad? Martin. Good to see you. You called, I came. Look, I wouldn't normally ask, but things are a bit rough at the moment. I need somebody to mind the shop. She's left me, you see. Well. I'll sort it out, Dad. Thanks mate. I owe you. Right, it's all yours. Gotta see a man about a dog. What was Malcolm's reaction to seeing you arrive home? He was absolutely thrilled, and he told me how much he loved me. We went to bed and, I held him all night in my arms. He was like a lost little boy. How did he behave following that night? The next morning he said "I'm really going to stop drinking, "can you find the number for Alcoholics Anonymous?" So I did. And he made a phone call, and I left them talking. Did Malcolm drink, or not? No, he did not. So for how long did he remain off the drink? Two whole weeks. What about the court proceedings arising out of the matter which had happened in May? He was due to appear in court that June the 21st, and he didn't mention it for the whole two weeks until the Friday night. Before you went to the conference? Yes. What was said about that court matter, on that Friday? He said as he'd been dry for two weeks, would I please drop the charges? How did you react to what he asked you to do? I agreed. I'm leaving you in charge of the crown jewels, Malcolm. If you let me down- You worry too much. Go on. Sara, look at you! You'd make a fortune if you could bottle it! -You look gorgeous. -And you, Amy, love. Uh oh, we're up. I'm just going to make a call. - Don't be long. - No. Malcolm, it's me. Is everything all right? Yes, great, she's in bed. - Is she? - Yeah. That's good. And Martin's on his way back? Yeah, he'll be back in a minute. You're all right, are you? Yeah! Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine, fine, no problem. Okay then, love, bye. Hello? Hello? You know, I've been thinking. The night is young, stars are shining, there you are, here I am. Why are you looking so sad? Excuse me, I need to make a phone call. Sara? Well, it's nothing I said. You lying bastard. Sara? Bastard, bastard, bastard! Are you all right? No, I'm not all right! I trusted him! Lying bastard! He's out of his brains! Martin's nowhere to be seen, Luise's hysterical! Fucking kill him! Let's try and be sensible about this, Sara! "Promise, love!" Promised that she'd never have to see him drunk again! -Do you think you should- -What? Well, won't they need you at home tonight? No. There's nothing I can do now. Luise's safe, Mary's picked her up. She's staying with Mary tonight. I'll pick her up first thing in the morning. He's not going to destroy everything, I'm not going to let him! Well, if, if there's nothing else, I'll say good night. I'm gonna bloody, bloody well enjoy, Aren't I here to enjoy myself? And what happened then? She said, I'm going to kill him. I can remember saying something about you can't look at it like that, you can't do that. She was very angry and upset. Did she give any reason or explanation for this statement, saying that she was going to kill him? She did point out that she wasn't prepared to lose everything. She wasn't going to let Malcolm make her lose everything she'd got. I can't remember her saying much more than that. I have no more questions, M'lord. Did you take it seriously? No, not really. Why was that? She was very upset. And I did say to her, you don't mean that, don't talk like that. It's the sort of comment I would make to anybody. So you yourself did not take it very seriously at the time. No, but I was worried. On the night of the conference, did she suggest that she should go home? No. Did you suggest that she should go home? Yes I did. Do you know how old Luise is? I believe she's 10. You were told that night that your daughter had fled from the house in a distressed condition and been taken by taxi somewhere else. Now, which person in the whole wide world would a little girl want at such a moment? Her mother. I'm sorry? -Her mother. -Her mother. On the night of the conference, you had a very good time at that party at the hotel, did you not? I enjoyed myself, yes. Including having a little fling with one or two of the young men who were there. No. Somebody called Bradley Forbes. Did you meet anybody called Bradley Forbes that night? He's one of the men, yes. And you and he went off together for a substantial part of the evening. No, we didn't. Be very careful about these answers. I am suggesting to you that the two of you withdrew from the main area where the party and the dancing were going on and were alone for some period of time, which I cannot specify exactly, but more than a few minutes. Now that is true, is it not? No, it's not true. You're hardly a very modest person about your body, are you? No, perhaps not. By any normal standards, you are a very immodest person about your body. I wouldn't say that. I understand you do not wear knickers or underclothes, that you have a habit of going out in public and displaying yourself. I do not display myself. If you do not display yourself, how on earth do you think I know about it to put the question to you? I don't know. Excuse me, could I have a word? There's something I really think- In all my years at the bar, I don't believe I've ever encountered a client who deliberately withheld evidence that was so vital to their case in this way. If you had told me all of this at the beginning, we might well have succeeded in preventing your case from ever coming to court. Now, however, with this late admission, I'm gravely concerned that as with your lying about your exam results, the court will consider your testimony to be further impugned. I'm not mad. I'm afraid the evidence is too important. You must present it to the court. Did there come a time when you lived in Manchester? Yes. Did you meet a man called Thomson at that stage? Yes I did. Did something happen as a result of your relationship with him? I became pregnant. What happened to the pregnancy? It was terminated by mutual understanding between myself and Mr. Thompson. Could we go on to the year 1976? You met a man called Peters. Yes I did. Did anything happen as a result of your relationship with Mr. Peters? I became pregnant. I started to bleed very heavily, and they took me into the hospital by an ambulance. and through mutual agreement, the hospital offered me, or, I suggested, I can't remember exactly which, I had a termination. Following that part of your life, did you continue living in Manchester? Yes, I did. Did you meet someone during that period? Yes. My first husband, Mr. Glashenning. Did something happen during the period that you were living with him in Chorlton-cum-Hardy? Yes. I, I went to bed and, when I woke up, I was in a police station. I was, had no clothes on, and was clutching a teddy bear, but I don't know who I was, or where I was. and I was very frightened and very confused. Klaus came to the police station. I didn't know who he was. Where did you go from the police station? I believe Klaus took me back to the house. The next morning I went to the doctor. I was very frightened about what had happened, and I told him, and he was very concerned for me, so he had me admitted to a psychiatric hospital. So let us move on to the year 1981. Did matters come to a head sometime during that year? Yes, they did. What happened in that year? My father said I was sponging off my grandfather and yet my grandfather didn't want me to leave him. And I felt torn. I felt that I couldn't satisfy anybody. And I got very depressed and eventually I cut my throat. Were you attempting suicide? Yes, I was. I should like the jury to see those scars. Do you want to see them now? Yes, as I've mentioned it, now perhaps will be appropriate. Would you mind leaving the witness box and walking in front of the council and then standing over there? Following the attempted suicide, did you go into hospital? Yes I, yes I did. Why did you not mention these various incidents during the course of your main evidence last week? Because I feel ashamed. Normal people don't go around cutting their throats and wrists, and finding themselves naked in a police station in the middle of the night. No more questions. My own views do not, of course matter in the least, but I find myself totally mystified. Are you now saying that you did deliberately stab your husband? No, not so. Well then are you still saying that what happened was in effect an accident, in the sense that you intended him no harm whatsoever? I didn't mean to hurt him at all, sir. Now let us have this absolutely crystal clear, because your new evidence suggests that you are claiming diminished responsibility. But you are not saying to my Lord and the jury "Yes I murdered my husband, "but I am not guilty of murder "because there is something wrong with me." You are not saying that, are you? No. Dr. Kingsman, did you hear the tape recording of her telephone call to the ambulance service, the 999 call? Yes I did. How did she sound to you? She certainly sounded calm, but she didn't sound normal. I think she used the phrase "good afternoon" and it was sometime in the early hours of the morning. I formed the impression that at that time she had disassociated herself from the horrible thing that had happened. And it was as if somebody else were reporting it. Thank you. No more questions. Is the effect of your psychiatric evidence then that if she found herself in sufficiently stressful circumstances, she could take human life without being guilty of murder? If she found herself in sufficiently stressful circumstances, if they could be duplicated exactly, which is very difficult, it is possible she might behave in a similar way again. So if we do not find her guilty, what you are in fact saying, and I take your point about stressful circumstances, but what you're really saying is that we will be giving her a licence to kill. I am not going to say that she is likely to kill the next man that walks into her life. I am not going to say that, because it is not true. Nobody would suggest it was likely, but you could not rule it out, if a relationship grew sufficiently stressful. What I would like to stress is this sort of thing does not happen without a lot of warning. There were plenty of warnings in her relationship with Thornton. Well, unless it was a total lie. And the jury may think that it was, I don't know. She was saying that she would not leave him, that she wanted to stay and help him because she loved him. Now that could easily happen in another relationship, could it not? I think she did love him. I am merely asking if it could not easily happen in some future relationship. I don't think I would say easily. I wouldn't deny that it could happen again. But the statistics, if you are interested in statistics, in terms of domestic killings, are that they do not happen again. It is very rare. My lord, there is a matter of law on which I would like to address your Lordship. Members of the jury, would you mind leaving the court for a while? Please be seated. I'm wondering whether I really ought to apply for a new trial. What my learned friend has in effect been suggesting over the last few minutes to the jury is that if they let this defendant go, she may do it again. Whichever way one looks at it, that is the inference. And that is so prejudicial that this jury really cannot contemplate this case now with any degree of objectivity. What we object to particularly are the emotive and thoroughly prejudicial words, "licence to kill" which add a headline, which can only remain in the jury's minds from the beginning to the end of their deliberations. There is in my view, not the slightest risk of this jury, if properly directed, reaching any conclusion adverse to the defendant on an improper basis. I am satisfied that this case will be tried correctly with the jury in accordance with the directions I shall give them. And in those circumstances, I reject the application for a new trial. It's all right. -My head- -It's all right. It's all right, we're going to get you better now. Hello, can you send an ambulance please? My husband's taken an overdose. I only gave him six. Should get the help he needs now. I don't know how many. I found these in the bath. All right. Come on, son. Let's get you turned over. Come on, mate. Hands off me, what's going on? Take it easy, mate. Malcolm, they're here to help you! Help me? I mean, one minute I'm having a kip, the next thing these two buggers in here are trying to cart me off! Sir, is there anywhere you can stay? Well, I suppose the Bears have got a bed, only thing is the bitch has got my wallet! You stop here. I don't want to see the bitch. Mrs. Thornton, in order to solve the immediate problem, I think Malcolm should stay in town tonight, but he says you have his cheque card and wallet. Oh, god. If I give him his money back, he'll spend it all on drink. He'll bankrupt us. With the money, he goes. Without it, he stays. I know you're not a doctor, but I suggest you knew, because it is common knowledge, that the combination of that sort of tranquilliser and alcohol is dangerous. Yes, I realised that afterwards. I was trying to help him. So you were not trying to kill him then? No, I wasn't. I didn't at any time try and kill him. Bye! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Mary's picking you up from school, okay? Got your toothbrush? Okay? -Bye. -Bye. You've taken your wedding ring off. Well, I don't feel married anymore. He's cleaned us out, Martin. What? I can't take much more of this. Right, I'm off. I'm home. Seeya. See you later. Right, gentlemen. Last orders please. Come on now, let's be having you. Get us another of these, Babs? Do you want a cup of tea? Dad? You still here then, are you? Where do you suggest I go, Malcolm? We're broke. Anywhere. Just as long as you get your fucking arse out of my face. Anywhere. Why don't you find some poor sod who'll pay for the ride? Okay, enough's enough. Bed. I'm not going anywhere, you fucking whore. Malcolm, stop this. Stop it. I don't do what you tell me. You know, when you're in bed asleep, in I'll creep, quick as a flash and you'll be history. Malcolm, I can't take any more from you today. Get upstairs. Did you want to kill him? No. Or hurt him? No. I wasn't thinking anything. I was upset, I was a little confused, and I was angry. There's no doubt I was angry. I just wanted him to come to bed. And I wanted him to see how much he was hurting me and destroying everything. Members of the jury. At 24 minutes past three on the morning of Wednesday, the 14th of June last year, Malcolm Thornton was diagnosed dead. He died as a result of a single stab wound to his unprotected abdomen, which penetrated some 13 to 17 centimetres into his body. That fatal blow was inflicted by his wife, the defendant Sara Thornton. The prosecution alleged that Mrs. Thornton is guilty of murdering her husband. The defence say she is guilty. She is guilty of something, but she is guilty only of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. In reality, you now have to decide between these two questions: murder, or manslaughter? Now members the jury, all this early history obviously requires your attention. The terminations of pregnancy can obviously be seen as manifestations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. And there is a question about how and why she made herself pregnant and to have no less than three abortions. One possible view is that it was very selfish of her. Members of the jury, even if Mrs. Thornton had lost her self control, you would still have to ask whether a reasonable woman in her position would have done what she did. If you think that she went out, found a knife, went back into the room, and then as a result of something said to her, stabbed her husband, as he laid defenceless on that settee, then it may be very difficult to come to the conclusion that this was a reasonable action. There are many, many unhappy, indeed miserable husbands and wives, but on the whole, it is hardly reasonable, you may think, to stab them fatally when there are other alternatives available, like walking out or going upstairs. Will the foreman please stand. Members of the jury. On this indictment, have you reached a verdict upon which at least 10 of you are agreed? Yes. On the charge of murder, do you find the defendant, Sara Elizabeth Thornton, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. You find the defendant guilty of murder. Yes. You'll like it in America. But I want to stay with you. Come on, you'll miss your train. Please don't make me go. Billi says they've got 60 different kinds of ice cream in America. I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. Please can I stay with you, Mum? Have I done something bad? No, darling. Please, I want to stay with you. I want to stay with you, I don't want to go. Don't make me go! Come on, time to go. -Come on, now. -No! Don't make me go, don't make me go Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, don't make me go! Mummy, Mummy, please! Mummy, don't make me go! Mummy, please don't make me go! On February the 13th 1990, Sara Thornton was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. On July the 28th, 1995, she was freed on bail and granted the right to appeal. The result of her appeal was a retrial. On May the 30th 1996 at her retrial, Sara Thornton was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter and was released, having served five and a half years in prison. The judge said: "I'm sentencing you on the basis that "your responsibility for killing your husband "was diminished by your abnormality of mind. "Were I to sentence you for manslaughter by provocation, "the sentence would be the same. "I take into account the difficulties you've had "living with an alcoholic husband. "But you nonetheless bear a considerable responsibility "for taking his life."
