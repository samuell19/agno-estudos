Moe, I'm starting to get dizzy. - One second, we are sorting this out. - Okay Moe, I don't want to lose my temper! Don't worry Magdy, It's a small problem, we are fixing it. - The crane driver left. - How? - We can't find him! - How is that even possible? We have no keys. We can't bring him down. What nonsense is this? Would you kindly include me in this conversation? We are talking about that move. Shall we do it with or without the fist? You mean this one? That's it. This works well. Alright, stay there. Two fists for still photography. - Don't loose the playback. - That guy... - I called him in vain. - Well done - What's happening on set today? - Shit is happening. Were you able to see him? No, he was transferred to prison this morning. We need people to talk about this. Especially celebrities. I'm ready to shoot. Let's do it now if you want. Okay, but I also want you to ask Ahmed Magdy. It would attract more attention for the campaign. I'll talk to him when we finish the shoot. - Moe, we're going to bring another kid. - Why? They want options. Okay. - Check it out. - Son of a bitch! You caught a picture? Hell yeah. She wants it. She's here to get photographed. - Hottest booty in media. - Remember the one in the milk advert? - She's the one with the white pants. - Oh my God. The white pants. - I have a separate folder for that one. - Swear to God. I swear, look. - You bastard! - Not yours, dude. - Please. - Shut up! We're at work, man. What are you doing? Relax, we have one shot to go. Let's avoid trouble. - Are we going to shoot or not? - Yes. - There's a corner we can use there. - Let's go. It's okay, you can't change the universe. Action. My name is Mohamed Abdel Hady. I'm a director. Today, my friend is in prison because he used profound language in his novel. - And... - You're hitting me in front of people? I haven't even started with the beating! I'm sorry, one second. There's a fight. - You're doing it wrong. - Let it go. Mostafa, this is unreasonable! I'll drag you to court! What's going on here? - This is the crane man. - We found him. Are you beating him up on my set? No. I'll show him a lesson outside! Man! Let me talk to him. Who is this? He's the driver who brought the crane man. I'm Mostafa, sir. Alright, please don't beat anyone up. - Leave him. - He left him hanging on the crane, sir! Back to work! - I won't have fist fights on my location. - It's not the subject... - Forget it, it's not even your issue. - No, it's a... There's nothing to photograph here. This is not a prank show! Who's the woman taking pictures? Who are you here with? Marwan! She's with me. Not the moment to take pictures. Amazing work man! Brilliant! Really? - Want some water? - Open it for me. You should go see him. Later. I wanted to give him the script but I forgot to bring it with me. I have my copy. Here. Moe, how do you like this one? They wanted a brown kid. - Egyptian and all that. - And the other was Chinese? Not Chinese, Moe, but this is a regional ad. The audience abroad will want to see a typical brown Egyptian. No, what nonsense is this? - Come on, choose your battles, man. - No way, forget it. - Please, It's one shot. - No way. - Go choose your battles. - No. - You're being too stubborn, Moe. - No. He really liked you. This is unacceptable. Unacceptable What's unacceptable, Magdy? Calm down, let's get this last shot over with. Didn't you see me hanging there? And your friend photographing me? I was going to die! She didn't mean to. She is here to shoot with me for our friend in prison. - Why is she photographing me then? - She wanted to shoot with... I got you this gig to get it over with. So please, finish it off. What are you trying to say? You got me the gig? I didn't mean it this way. Look, you haven't been able to finish your film for months. And the whole thing with Mai. You need to get out of this environment. Isn't this a good chance? So, it's all my fault now? With your energy, nothing will go well! What energy? Are you serious? I'm fed up, don't talk bullshit! Fed up with what? We barely started! You want to know why I am fed up? I'm fed up since Mai left me. Since my friend got two years for a novel. Since my best friend, who happens to be my film's main actor is humiliating for getting me a gig. And mind you, it's a shit ad. So please, Magdy, please. Get dressed and let's finish this. - I have to rest for a bit. - No, I'm sorry, let's get this over with. Mr. Mohamed. Nada has a great suggestion. How do you like this boy? - He looks more Egyptian. - Yes, he does. I know you don't like things to be... But it's not an independent film. The kid is really good. What's your name big boy? You'll work on him a little but he is not demanding. Alright guys. If you're fine with this kid, I'm fine with him too. - Yes, we are. - Alright, let's go. This boy is much better people, isn't he? Well done, Moe. - Well done, Moe. - Well done Are you still upset? Not at all. It's fine. Go ahead! We really love your films. I cried watching "Cairo six, seven, eight". Mohamed Diab has very good movies. Him and Moe have very different styles, but I am sure they are good friends. Mr. Mohamed, are we good to roll? I'm ready if they are happy. We're very happy. - Sure? - Yes. - Are you still upset? - Alright Let's roll. Rolling! Four p.m. for the editing? What? I haven't slept since yesterday. Nobody slept, Moe. But I still have to shoot with Dina. Oh, the thing with your friend? Please let's finish our work first... then do your thing. Two hours, man. Squeeze them in. - You know the address? - Yes, in Dokki, sir. Let's go, Moe. Let's go. Thanks Moe! Go. Do you mind filming on my balcony? No. But he still didn't get the script. No, please keep it with you. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to ask him about the campaign. Don't worry about it. Call journalists. Let them write about this. A writer is in prison. What else are they supposed to write about? Excuse me, Miss. Do you mind a question? - If Mr. Moe doesn't mind either. - Sure, go ahead. Are you talking about this guy, whose novel... would you excuse me, insults public decency? Yes. Good job Miss! So people know who's outraging. So it won't happen again. And what won't happen again? The swearing! Kids will read these things. Ah, so you never swear? Miss, where I live, even our "good morning" differs from yours. It depends on your wisdom, education and ability to watch your language. So basically, you swear and you think that's okay. But you think a writer putting this on paper should go to jail? Look, I am not as educated as you. But people have different responsibilities. - So you could swear on the street. - Yes. Imagine someone like you being assaulted. Will he swear or not? Watch out man! Are you sleeping in there? Easy on the glass, I can see you! - Right here, Mostafa. - Okay sir. Wait here, I'll be back in no time. Mr. Moe, if you don't mind, I'll pass by my house in Hadayek quick... - bring my taxi and come back. - Taxi? Of course. It's a comfortable taxi with AC. It'll be less than 15 minutes... It'll never be 15 minutes. You've seen the traffic because of the visit. Don't worry I have my ways, I'm a taxi driver after all. I'll be back in less than a minute. - Be here when I'm out. - Yes, Mr. PHOTOGRAPHY PROHIBITED What's the story, Bahr? Are we a military zone now? No, not a military zone. But a lot of young ones come and take pictures. They look like, you know... Are they bothering you that much? No. But it's the way they dress, their hairdos and their weird pants. Plus, if Hussein Bey hears about it, he'll detain them. But that doesn't apply to me of course. No, of course not. Bring out your camera - Bye, Bahr. - Bye, Sir. Why not have a character in your film reading the novel on the boat? A villager, escaping on a boat with a novel? How does that work? Are you serious, so villagers don't read novels? You never leave your apartment, do you? No, I'm anti-social that way. I'm just kidding. Don't take everything so seriously. - I want to read you part of the novel. - Alright. I feel it really fits the film. Listen and tell me what you think. Look. "It is yet another curse of Cairo's curses. In Cairo, there's no such thing as a relationship ending, once it has begun. Even if two people slammed their doors in each other's faces. They'd inevitably run into each other again, whether at a traffic light, a concert or a coffee shop. What's more, even if coincidence conspired with their decision to stay apart, their large and closely intertwined networks of friends would surely reconnect them... and force them to find new and alternative ways to redefine their relationship." And how does that fit the film? How can't see the link? Our attempts to escape, things we're used to, things that own us. What the hell is this, Moe? Seriously. Nice? I just got it A tent in the living room? I bought it for tomorrow's trip. Thought I'd try it out first. It's nice. - Let's shoot? - Let's. Dina, why did you call it "my film"? Do you intend to leave the film? Moe, there is no film anyway. We haven't done anything in months. Plus, I need to focus on the campaign for now. I can't focus on a million things. You can easily find a replacement for me. As if there is anyone remaining. Ready? I'm ready. It's Mai's birthday by the way. Call her up say Happy Birthday. Nothing wrong with that. Listen, I won't leave now. I'll leave a copy of the novel for you before I go. Okay. PHOTOGRAPHY PROHIBITED Come in Mr. Moe. The whole city is at standstill because of this goddamn visit. But thank God nothing stands in Mostafa's way. Listen, we need to go somewhere before heading to the edit in Dokki. At your service, Mr. Moe. These ceremonies do not concern a regular guest It is a glorious ceremony to welcome a dear guest of the Egyptian people... Good evening. Good evening. - You're a director, right? - Yes. - The movie "Cairo six, seven, eight"? - Sorry, it wasn't mine. What's your name? I'm sorry I have to go. God damn women and their issues. Move, woman! It's a complete standstill on my end, too. We probably won't be able to meet today. Easy, Mostafa. What's wrong? Why don't they stay home and make it easy for us and themselves? You know the worst thing about this country? - Enlighten me. - Women's driving. She's even on the phone! Woman! Move away, for god's sake! Hello, what do you want now? Didn't I tell you I have work, and you know your uncle is a driver? I obviously left her sleeping at faggots'. Slap her on her damn mouth, and make her shut up. Handle it and don't make a scene. Hang up now, I'm coming right away. At least an hour and a half to Dokki. All this is because of the visit, sir. It's been like that all day. Hello. The country is a goddamn parking lot because of the visit! Please drop this attitude with me. I've seriously had a horrible day. If they want to leave, that's fine. Yes, tell them that. I will edit when I come back from my trip. Alright. What's wrong Mr. Mohamed? I heard you lose your temper on the phone. Relax, God's willing everything will be fine. Look, when the streets clear up a bit, take us back to Maadi. Sure. You're with the best driver in town. Please smile, your smile makes a difference to us all. I have a small favor to ask. Can I quickly drop by my nephew's place in Hadayek? He's almost your neighbor. - I just need to do something quick. - What is this, Mostafa? Why should I go to Hadayek in this traffic? I want to go home. Drive me home and then do whatever you please in Hadayek. What can I say, women issues. I don't want to cause you a headache with my problems. Alright, don't then. What can I say? May God protect our women. I just know you're open-minded and will understand me. Are you going to say what happened or you'll just keep talking riddles? Well, yesterday, my colleague returned the taxi to me after his shift. I take a look between the seats to find a naked knee barely covered with a 'Abayah. I don't get it. What did you find? A chick. One of these women. High on Tramadol and God knows what else. Don't say. So she had taken Tramadol or you made her take it? What are you saying, Mr. Mohamed? No way! This car is my bread and butter. Can't do that kind of thing on the road. So what did you do with her? I took her because I'm a parent too. I thought she will be safe, if she passes the night at my nephew's. So instead of driving her home, you took her to your nephew's place? I have a daughter Mr. Moe. I couldn't have left her on the streets. You can't let that happen of course. Now she's telling my nephew that I stole her wallet and took money from it. - What's a "boock"? - Her boock, sir. Her wallet. That's why I want to go figure out the situation. Please, Mr. Mohamed, may God protect you. I know you don't feel comfortable coming to our neighborhood because you can't deal with these people But I'll tell you what? Seeing the neighborhood will inspire you for locations and characters for a new film. God's willing we will congratulate you on it very soon. I knew it. I was sure you would agree. May God protect you. Fine. But listen, I'll give you two minutes. Everybody loves you on set. Obviously for a good reason. Mr. Moe, the AC is all yours. Don't bother about anything happening outside. I'll be back in 120 seconds on the dot. Oh, little one, you're torturing yourself I feel your pain You are being harmed and I feel your pain Oh, little one, you're torturing yourself I feel your pain You are being harmed and I feel your pain You are being harmed... Who is this man? - Let's check him out. - Hit the ball. Leave him alone, man. Spare us the headache, will you? What is this shit and who are you? - Who are you looking for? - All that noise you're making... Are you fucking with me? Why are you raising your voice? Give me my money and let me go! What money you liar? Is this my mistake? Look at all the drugs you're on! You know what, you're an indecent asshole! I am decent whether you approve or not. I won't offend you further because You're a woman after all. Just give me my money already and don't push my buttons more than this! Mr. Moe, I'm so sorry. There, you saw the situation for yourself. Who the hell is this Mr. Moe? Are you having a party, Jimmy? Toutou, what's wrong? This man brought you here when you were ill yesterday. And he's the one taking you home. Right, Mostafa? Do I look like a child to you? Waiting for Grandpa here to drive me? - May God give me patience! - What's your story? Is it the Money? Yes! This guy stole 600 pounds from me while I was passed out in his taxi. He took them from my wallet! Do you believe she even had two pounds in her wallet? Alright, I just really want to get going. I'll give you back your money, Okay? We'll go withdraw from the ATM machine. Can we please get this over with because I really want to go home? Alright. See the high-class people? One second, I'll get changed and come back. You do realize she's the kind who loses 600 pounds in a different house every night... Look at this, there's a dog. Dog? So what do you do, Jimmy? Cinema or photography? Not cinema. You could say a photographer. I am the admin of the "Cairo-Famous" page. - Cairo what? - Explain to him. This is Mohamed Abdel Hady! Director of that movie with the villa we saw together. Jimmy my nephew is the admin of that page for guys with hair bleached in oxygen and torn clothes... No, oxygen is what you'll have stuck in your mouth laying on a hospital bed. Look, man. Here, this is our page. You show some respect, boy. I'm your uncle, and we have visitors. Nice pictures. Can you explain to me what exactly this page is about? No, There's no time. We should get on with your errands Mr. Moe. Can you go ahead and call this corpse inside? And you gave her your mother's dress, you prick? This woman? - Toutou! - Yes Joujou, I'm coming right away. Toutou and Joujou. What were you saying about people hearing you "fight" all night? Shame on you. A woman wakes up to find her money is gone. What do you expect from her? A kiss on the lips? Anyway man, at first it was a hobby. Then it got bigger and more serious. Move and call that corpse inside. I just called her. Toutou! Totta! Tito! Coming. Let's go. Sorry my darling. I was in the bathroom and couldn't hear you. I'm sorry about losing my temper. I saw you all walk in and thought Jimmy set a trap for a special party. Don't be rude. This is my uncle's friend. A filmmaker. I think he has a film with Dorra in it or something. What was the name of the film again? His film doesn't matter. What matters is knowing her film and her story. And who's that tempered uncle of yours? - Here we go! - Oh wait, you must be Danny DeVito! You better watch out. I'm not like these two. - You don't want to get me angry. - Relax Mostafa. Relax, relax. Toutou, get up. Make a round of tea. Easy on him, he's my uncle. He raised me. I don't believe he raised you. Toutou, think. If he stole your money, why would he bring you here? What money, Jimmy? Does this look like someone who has 600 pounds? Yes, 600 pounds. You conscienceless sorry excuse of a driver. I want every penny back or I swear to God... What God? What do you know about God? Your money is cursed, stealing from you is a virtue. But I wouldn't feed my children with your dirty money. Oh go ahead and talk to me about honesty and manhood. By the way, I'm on to you. The moment you walked in I knew exactly what you want. Drink your tea and quit these games. Could've added a little more sugar. Only one spoon. There's a sugar shortage. Oh, the patriotism! Can there really be a shortage of sweetness while you're around? So what's your name, Captain? You can call me Galal. No... Pleased to meet you, Gelgel. Where from? Patience, we'll still get to know each other. What sweet guy. I'll go get my phone from the charger. Wait for me. Waiting. Wait... - So you're handling it this way, Mr.? - What way? Didn't you want to resolve the situation? I resolved it and I'll pay her. You enjoy it, you and Jimmy. I think Galal is making a lot of sense. And his money is clean. His name is not Galal and his money is not clean. You think if he saw you on the street, he would even look at you? No, I will greet him normally. Look, like this. What did you think Moe? You want to come to my neighborhood, all the way here... take the chick and leave? What does that make me? A pimp? You calling me "Moe"? Only charged three percent, shitty Chinese chargers. Why are you standing like this? Let's go. I haven't eaten since yesterday. Jimmy are you not joining us? No, I have to get something done in Maadi. You take care and good luck. And do you vouch for that guy? Well, he's my uncle, but if anything happens call me. Alright, bye. Don't forget to send me the pictures. Pictures? Let's go. Bye, Jimmy. Good to meet you. Listen This girl had a very bad night. Don't add to it. Okay? See what you will agree to and eventually take her home. Don't worry about it man. All the way to her house. Cool. Stop it Sousou. Come in. What the hell, Moe? You left the AC on with the keys inside! - Just "Moe"? - That's better for cooler weather. I'm sorry Mr. Moe. I Just worried about the car. Alright, you listen to me. Take us to the main road. I'll take her with me to Maadi and handle it. You think Maadi is close? I thought it was "around the corner". That's if you're alone. But now you have her majesty... You'll get robbed and end up with nothing. Robbed? Don't you know where I'm from? Where is our princess from? Basateen. The finest people. We are practically neighbors Mr. Moe. What a pleasant surprise. Okay. Drop us off on Road Nine. I'll give her the money... then I'll call an Uber for you. No babe, I don't ride Uber. I only ride Careem. Deal. Uber and Careem? Your life surely got comfortable. All this for the 15 pounds in the wallet? Six hundred, and you know it. Every day 600 pounds? Every single day and even more. Plus I would give him what he wants, by choice and for free. - You know why? - Tell me Cause he's a prince and knows common decency. For the sake of the prince I have to invite you for lunch. In honor of the decent Mr. Moe. Finally! I'm starving actually. Make a wish, our princess. Mombar! I was just about to suggest it. - What do you say Mr. Moe? - Mombar? - Yes, I'm dying to have some. - Fatty and greasy. But I really can't be late, I don't want trouble in my neighborhood. True, Papa might punish you. Let's just go. Come in, both of you! Come in, Mr. Alright, just move a few steps so I can get in. Mostafa, you keep moving further away from Maadi. We won't get back before an hour. I can't go through Maadi, it's full of checkpoints. And Miss Toutou for sure, has no identification card. Well I don't, because a certain someone stole my whole wallet yesterday. We're never hearing the end of this. Why are you taking us through these dark streets at night? Don't worry about dark streets. You're my guest. Watch this. What is this, a festival? Next, Toutou will start Bellydancing you'll get us a few beers. You're joking? I am actually buying beers. Don't count me in, I have a hangover. You're tired, Toutou? Tired my ass. Toutou, the remedy for a hangover is simple. An ice-cold beer or physical effort. Physical effort? Should she start running in the middle of the street? Plus, warm beer is the real deal. - This goddamn thing. - What's pissing you off? It's fucking up my eyes! Sorry about that. Toutou, listen. I have a single malt Whiskey bottle at home. Have you heard of single malt? This malt is in films. You know the scenes with the silk red robe and... the man lying down. It works in your field. There we are: At 'Am Hamza's It's an awesome place. One second. Are you in the cinema field for real? Sometimes. Why don't you show me a movie you made? It's only one film two years ago. That's okay. Show me part of it on the internet. Better not. You'll get depressed. Why? Does your hero die in the end? No, but when I was writing the film I was depressed. Your perfume is very nice Here, keep this with you. Looks like it's going to be a long night. How much did you pay, Mostafa? What are you talking about? No such thing, don't offend me. Just tell me, how much? Why did you turn off the system? I put it in especially for you. - Here. - Thanks. And for you. No, I'll have some later since I'm driving. What's going on Mr. Moe? Why so nervous? Don't worry you're in my neighborhood. That's what worries me. Why, where are you from Gelgel? The man is from Maadi. And I'm from Hadayek. And you're from Dar El Salam. So the difference between each of us... is one metro station. Wow. Only one metro station, yet all this difference. And they call our area "Hadayek" after gardens. What gardens? "Gardens" should refer to your neighborhood, Gelgel. So what does your neighborhood have? If I tell you you'll get upset. What's up, man? Why don't you leave him alone? It's his manners stopping him from responding to you. This "well mannered" man... has a friend who's in jail for verbal sexual harassment. You know these kinds, Galal? It doesn't show on you. Sheikh Mohamad Al Jahlan. Here's the place. Go ahead and I'll park the car and pray first. Just to save time, let me park it while you go and pray. I can't ask you to do that, you're my guest. Oh, drop it. Come on give me the keys I'll park it. - Won't you come pray with me? - I'll pray at home later. Don't worry about the car. So, Toutou. Want to see real driving skills? I'm all ready. He's not very fond of you. You noticed, too? It's my job, Mr. Artist. Your job is to figure out who's pissed at whom? No. My job is to read men. So you can read all the men? You're not really complicated, honestly. If you're so smart, shouldn't we have cut it short and gone to my place? Instead of cruising around. In such a hurry, are we? Since the moment I saw you. Pull yourself together, we're in the middle of the street. It took him ages to park. I told him to let me do it instead. I told her you don't like women driving. Hi, how's it going? Special treatment for my guests, okay? I'll have a mixed boiled plate, I always take and the soup, too. The Mombar, please. The most important item. A plate of tongue, a plate of calf legs. The tongue fried please. I came here for the Mombar. And a plate of mixed head meat. And soup for them, too. You catch my drift. Special treatment. Wait, please! Why didn't you order me the Mombar? When men speak, women like you shut their mouths. Get to work, boy. Get the plates! One boiled mix and soup. - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. Mostafa, hitting a woman doesn't make you a man. Really? You're talking about manhood? You think your 600 pounds buy you the last word? Or is it your filth in my taxi, that I chose to ignore that make you feel like a man? I'll show you how men can ride women. Amen? Boss! Boss! Ramses, Ramses! Ramses, Ramses! Welcome back, beautiful. Here, eat the Mombar with full force. Looks like this little piece of Mombar is the best you can do tonight. Really? Alright eat and don't ruin tonight's mood. Ruin the mood? Me? It seems your wife is wearing the pants and ruining your mood at home. God forbid. I'm not one whose wife can wear the pants. Eat. Just eat and change the subject. Alright, Mostafa. Pass the bread. At your service. I would bake it for you if I could. Mr. Moe, you're only having a soft drink? Come on. We're breaking bread here. No, I'm good, thanks. I'll step out for a smoke. - I'll just take one from your pack. - Take the whole pack. No, I just want one. It's normal. When I'm in a lousy mood or pissed off... I could smoke a whole cartridge. May God forbid lousy moods. Amen. Gelgel! I thought you left. Why leave? The night is young! Didn't Toutou say it'll be a long night? Looks like you'll be the first to fall asleep though. Nope! You need to reconsider your statement. Why would anyone like warm beer. You're probably naive, and might drink it all at once. It's really bitter. Wait, I'll fix you. By the way, I don't buy that you're a cinema guy. Why not? I hear cinema people scream and shout a lot at people. I can scream and shout. But I thought you were able... I wasn't waiting for you to do anything. I've gotten used to people letting out their problems on me. Why do you have to accept it? You don't accept a thing or two every day? Despite coming from a high social class and being a man. Imagine you're a woman living my life. Which is more difficult to imagine? Being a woman or living my life? Lupins Lupins with lime and chili. Here you go. Gelgel, can you handle chili or should I go ask for one without? By the way, Mostafa is a good guy. Not only because he just came in. I'm really convinced. Of course you're not taking money for this either. Can't do. You're in my neighborhood. What neighborhood, Mostafa? We're almost on the bridge. So what? Everywhere is my neighborhood. I know people everywhere. We shall see. The night is still long. Length is not everything. No excuse me. Length is very important. Good one. See how she twists words? Please turn up the volume! Doesn't matter if I seem indifferent while you seem like the angel Hit the road now I've seen enough of you Hit the road now And shut the door behind you Come on, Gelgel! Watch for that dearness Not to turn into animosity While I make you live a drama Darling, don't make me do this to you... Very good, sir! Guys, any of you got the brown stuff? Why didn't you say early on? We were at Jimmy's, he would've gotten us some. Anyway, still doable. Hey, man. What's up bro? Got anything on you? Of course. - Thank you, man! - What are you doing, are you crazy? Have you gone mad, Mostafa? Easy guys, he's a colleague and we're on the road, nobody cares. I don't know where it is. Don't get overly confident, okay? I'm originally a truck driver, okay? I think I might have smoked it, man. Looks like it was heavy stuff. Hard luck. Take care. - I'll be damned! Again? - No, no, no. What are you doing? What is it, sir? You're getting us into serious trouble. The police is everywhere for that visit. Really, don't worry about it. It's all drivers' code. He'll give us a piece and we'll probably pay double. Maybe his stuff is mixed with Tramadol or contraceptive pills. Well, that would come in handy, Toutou. You've gotten wittier since this morning. I've always been witty. You just haven't noticed. Okay, quit this, I have the perfect solution. We head to my place... and I'll have you smoke Afghani hash you've never tried before. You have Afghani hash? What have I been saying all along? I have Whiskey. I have single malt. I have hash. I have everything. Let's just go to Galal, then, Mostafa and enough of this. Some people just like it dirty. Him. Not me. Hey, Jimmy. Where are you? Do you have any what's it called? That's it, yes. Got any? Fantastic you're always ready. Can you come meet me, I haven't gone up the bridge yet. Are you seriously stopping here? There's a beer in my hand, what if the cops stop here? Holy shit. Was he following us? Holy shit indeed. Stay put. I'll be back. My nephew is making me proud. You still haven't gone home? How are things over here, Toutou? - Not so great honestly. - Alright you guys go ahead. - He came with his team. - Of course. If I've known you're into hash, I would have offered some earlier. - But I thought you're into chemical stuff. - What gives you this idea? Isn't your film about drugs called... "On a day like today", or something? I swear it's not mine. Guys, are you into stamps? I'm into anything. We'll do whatever is available. After yesterday's son of a bitch client did what he did, I stole a few of his stamps. But I felt guilty after and wanted to throw them away. I say we all take them and so, the sin will be divided amongst us. Brilliant idea. Park your motorcycle, then bring Sousou and get in. - You look dead-worried. - It's going to be an amazing night. I surely hope so. What are you doing, Toutou? It's my first time I don't know how to take it. You're going to place it on your tongue. Don't swallow it. Good job. - Do you want a stamp, Sousou? - Let her be. Put it gently right there. Nice. Here you go, superstar. I'll take that. Take. Can you handle it or will we have to drag you to a hospital? Are your hands clean? I don't want a smelly high. Smelly? Do you even understand what you're saying? This "Battle in a Taxi" movie is still on? It will never end. Sheikh Mohamed El Jahlen. Hey there, sweetheart. No, I thought you slept and forgot about me. How you feeling? Here you are, sweetie. Like I need you, on top of everything. For your info, this is a respectable place. Listen... how could I get to Mostafa Kamel Square? It's getting late and I have scouting to do. What scouting? Didn't I tell you I photograph the boys? I even showed you the page. So you are the reason they banned photography? Give me directions. You'll go straight... Listen... take me with you... I better go home. Will you be able to go home alone? Leaving? Where are you going, Galal? Going home. Thought I'd leave you to your work and clients. Your energy ruined my business. The guy's mother walked in on him and he hung up. You kept saying the night is young. And now you're taking off? Listen... get off that motorcycle. I said get off. Get off, man. I'll send you a location later. I'll wait for you down there. Thanks. Mostafa! Hot chickpeas. In a while. Okay we're down by the dock. Okay. What are you doing? No thanks, I don't like it. It's hot chickpeas! Nobody doesn't like hot chickpeas. It's a well-known fact: "Chilling by the Nile" means "hot chickpeas". What a tourist attitude? My hands are burning away carrying this and you call this tourism? I know you are here to watch us. Helps you write real "local" characters for your film. Right? I'm in to you. And then you'll just leave, Right? No. For starters, my film is on a boat. The whole film? No some parts on the boat, others close to Qena in the south. It's a cool idea. I'll go watch it in the cinema. Wow! Look! Here. What ruined your mood suddenly? No reason. What is this stamp we took exactly? No clue, I just took it like you did. You look tired, and might go drop dead next to him. No, I'm no amateur. - Alright. - No... Let's take a picture for the memory. Good idea. Let's do it. After today, I know I'll never see your face again. Why do you make me feel like I'm an ass? This way for the view with the boats, genius. Turns out you're a director. You mean you can't remain decent for just two hours? Dirty people. What the fuck, man! Who do you think you are? Come, Toutou. Did you think we're on set here? Have you lost your mind? You really think you're a fucking star? Did he promise to make you famous? He's a nobody! Nobody knows him. No one recognized him all day! - You've crossed the line! - Why, am I fighting Al Pacino? You mother fucker! You are just an asshole. You seem so dreamy, honey. - Get out, girl! - I'm so sorry sir. I didn't hear you. Of course, you're day-dreaming. What are you doing with these men? I'm just taking a taxi home, Sir. So you don't know these two? No, I swear I don't know them. Are you playing dumb? You're coming to the station. Move it! I'm not a felon to be caught this way. I don't want to hear a word! Move! So, help me to get in the car. Move on people! Your phone. - I don't have a phone. - What do you mean? Fine, wait. Mohamed Abdel Hady! Leave him here. - Let's get the food out. - What? - Sir... - Get me the Identity Cards. Sir, I just want to say that this is a misunderstanding. - I didn't do anything. - Of course. - Sir I... - I can't seem to finish this level. Speak already. As I was saying, sir, you arrested us, but we didn't do anything wrong... Wait a second. You're an American University graduate? Yes, AUC. An AUC graduate in a homelessness case. That's a first! Even for me. No Sir, this was just a misunderstanding between two friends. Between what? Or acquaintances. Friends or acquaintances? And how do you know them, from a brothel? - I can't allow this talk sir. - You what, cutie? Say it again! I don't think I am out of order. Okay. So am I out of order, for speaking to you in this naughty way? Or are you breaking all sorts of law with what you just did? If you undergo a drug test now, won't I find a thing or two? What test, the smell speaks for itself. What about the smell of Alcohol? Listen, what you've done brought you here. God has put me in your way at this particular moment... so that I teach you a lesson. You'll get referred to prosecution tomorrow morning. - If you just give me a chance - I'll call you to sign later. Move it now! Hamada, take this guy from here. Go away! Go - I just want to explain. - I said out! Mostafa Mohamed El Kabbani. - Me? - Quick! Did anyone bother you? That's not the issue now Mr. Mohamed. Are you able to get us out or what? So of all the people you know, there is no one important to get us out? There must be a reason why God brought us together today, Mr. Mohamed. Toutou, I saw you tell that officer you don't know us. And it's the truth. Look I'm really sorry. Please don't be mad at me. What do you want me to do? We don't even have a phone. Give me 50 pounds. Come on! That's all I have. Hey Officer! Come here. What? What's your name? Marei. Tall and Handsome like this and still called Marei? I'll call you Hassan. Hassan is nice. Hassan, would you lend me your phone? You know phones are prohibited here. Obviously I am not placing my trust where I should. If Mohamed Bey walks out, we'll all get locked up. - I have an idea. - So? Mr. Mohamed really needs to pee. Take him to the bathroom and let him make one quick call. Alright. - Wait here until I come and get you. - Okay Yes, Dina. Sorry I woke you up, Dina, Can you call your uncle? I'm locked up in Kasr El-Nil Police Station. It's not the time, I'll explain later. Be quick. No, no phone. No, I was arrested on my own. - Speak up... - Thank you. He fucked you up completely. One of them inside was working in the prisons of the earlier days. It's okay. Seems like I've gotten too old for hustling in police stations. Don't say that. You're at the peak of your youth. You're still playing with words? It's all I have. It works sometimes. Where is the Don Juan? I got him a phone call. Hopefully his friends will get us out. You're very naive, Toutou. Tough life, but you seem so naive. - Got a cigarette? - Last one. Thanks, mate. Get us out you said. Drink some water. No, I don't want to. It will sober you up. It's good. He'll leave us behind first chance he gets. They will charge us with theft and drugs. The officer is on to us. I think he's a good guy. I know those people better. The moment you stand up to them, they show their real faces. They turn into monsters. Mr. Mohamed wake up please! The officer says the report is written, and they'll refer us in the morning to prosecution! Can your friends do anything at all? Hopefully, Toutou. And please don't be mad at Mostafa. He's poor and has children. Don't let what happened today... What's the story, Toutou? Why are you acting like you're in jail and I am in Brazil? I'm here locked up like you are. Mr. Mohamed Abdel Hady come with me! Hang up now. Our artist! Hello! How are you? How are you? Have a seat. What happened? I really don't know, but... You've made a mistake. These people are not your caliber, social class, environment or anything. It's your own doing. It's been a weird day from the time I met and interacted with them. Thank God no further damage was done. For Hamdy Bey's sake, we've separated your report from theirs. You were lucky I was here today It could have turned into an uglier night. - Don't worry. - Thank you, sir. Plus, it's an experience! You can use it in a film or TV series. Are you releasing anything in TV for Ramadan? So far no. Why not? TV series are the best. Nobody watches films anymore. Thanks, sir. Sir, what about Mostafa and the girl? Forget about it. You should be thankful with this outcome. The guy had a huge piece of hash. It could have amounted to drug trafficking, for which there's a death penalty. I'll try to push for consumption only. And the girl has a condom on her. I think this is already a pretty good deal. What are the instructions, pacha? Maadi? - Would you? - Thank you! Sorry, drop me off here I forgot something. Sure? Sorry sir. Thanks. Bye. - Wait! - What? The meter. But we just drove 50 meters. But the meter was started. I don't have money anyway. Come back here! Son of a... Mr. Mohsen. Could you let me in again? No way... Didn't you take your Identity Card? I did, sir. And I'm sorry... but I can't leave without the people that were with me. Trust me Mohamed, that's not possible. Sir there's a way to discuss everything. These people raised their voice and were rude to Mohamed Bey. Even if I speak to him he won't let them go. Mostafa had a few drinks. And that's okay? Take it as a price for his drinking then. Listen, I made an exception for you... because you're an educated man with a future ahead of you. It's in my benefit to give you a second chance. But these people are different. They will always come back here. And if they don't, eventually their children will. Son, please mind your own business and take responsibility for your actions only. I never want to see you here again. How do you know I won't be coming back? Everyone in this country has been coming here. What do you want, Mohamed? If you would only talk to Mohamed Bey, and I will go apologize to him in person. I know he wouldn't say no to you. Patience, God. I'm here to apologize to you, Sir... for anything I or they said that might have offended you. Alright, Mohamed. No problem, go ahead. Mohamed! If I ever hear you're back with a similar charge, you have no idea what I'll do. It won't be a walk in the park next time. Remember that you're elite. An artist, an AUC graduate. You won't be able to handle the roughness here. Go on now. Take your friends and leave. I'm sorry Mr. Moe, don't be upset. - I'll replace the phone I broke. - No, forget it, Mostafa. Here, take mine temporarily. Keep your phone. I don't even want one. He can't be seen with this cheap phone among movie stars. I'm trying to apologize. Alright, drop it you two. I don't want a phone. End of discussion. Shall I drop you two off? Okay. Listen, let's quit the favors. Go home. Toutou and I will find a ride. No way! Look at him. He can't go back to his wife like this. He'll lose his prestige. Men leave my company like lions. And what is a man without his prestige. My house is close. Come freshen up and go. Didn't you say there's trouble in your neighborhood? Only when I'm heading home at night. I am going home in the morning in all decency. Nobody can say a word. Good, we're going to yours. I want to talk to you about something. Okay. Don't say. It needs a push. A slight push. Go, Toutou! Looks like he'll leave us and run. - Wait for us. - Hold on, man. Thanks a lot guys. Sorry I exhausted you. - It's a good car though. - Of course. Friendship of a lifetime. I love this song. Would you turn up the volume? Does this ceiling really open? Yes of course. - Open it for me, will you? - Sure. My nights, go to him Tell him about my fire and longing Either he comes or I go to him I can't live in his absence Tell him that's enough And put an end to his distance I want no other with me... Come in please. Rabab! I swear, we could get robbed and you wouldn't even notice. You freaked me out! Who are they? You're bringing clients home? What clients? They're good friends of mine. This is Rabab, almost my cousin. Have a seat. Welcome, "her friends". Hi, Rabab. My real name is Mohamed Abdel Hady. He's a filmmaker! - So very nice to meet you. - Pleasure is mine. Have a seat everyone. You have cameras? This belongs to Rabab. Mohamed Abdel Hady? Yes. Director of "A Cup of Tea"? Oh my God, you saw it? Yes. Didn't I tell you to see it, Tahani? - Tahani? - Tahani? At last someone recognized you. Here. Did you like it? Honestly, it's very boring. But there's also something nice about it. That's good. I see you have better films. You haven't seen my hard disk collection. You're dying to know what I do for work, aren't you? A cheap copy. It doesn't work. Impossible, it's Russian. It never stops working. It just needs a film. I hope that pig's clothes fit you. I've exhausted you, Toutou. Let's forget about this whole night, Mostafa. A lesson from God, so we can stop doing wrong. What wrong, you didn't even do anything. People like us can't afford to do wrong. We're not like Mr. Moe. God. Stop obsessing about him already. I'm not obsessing I swear. He's from a different world. With just a phone call, he can travel to Britain or Argentina... change sceneries and meet different people. With one call he could change his job, where he makes me work so hard. But how would people like us change anything about our lives? We will remain like this forever. - I have to end this Turkish soap opera. - Not for a million-dollar... Are you alright? Listen, Tahani. Let's get married and live in virtue. I can't live without you after all you've done for me today. What do you say? Marry who? Are you crazy? Mr. Galal, haven't you seen where sin has taken us? Galal, who? And what sin? You think all this happened because of virtue and sin? Of course. Why else? Could be for a million other reasons. The circumstances we live in, this country we live in! It's not even remotely related to us. What are you trying to say? - Look, you want to repent your sins? - I wish. Go to Mecca. Apply for the pilgrimage lottery. I can pull some strings for you. Really, Mr. Moe? Of course not! What's the matter with you? Use your head a little! You don't know what happened between me and Tahani. When we were there on the floor, I suddenly got goosebumps. My heart warmed up and... And the rest of your body warmed up, too? - You know what this is called? - No, what? Being horny! And I can tell how to end it. How? - What are you saying? - No way! What happened to you? Have you lost your mind? You want to get into more trouble? This man had a really bad night. Since when are you such a softie? You know what he wants. I barely returned home today. I would never let that happen. You idiot. Shall we bring the marriage official? You really want to marry someone you met today? I thought about everything. I will destroy the old sim card and buy her a new one. So she can have some company and not feel lonely. I have someone who cares for me. That's not a problem at all. I have an idea. Instead of bringing a marriage official... we sign the papers for a customary marriage. - Right! - If things work well, we do the official process after. And that would be halal? - Of course! - Super halal. Of course! A "marriage official" is just a state employee making a living. That's a good point. Alright then. Who can take care of the procedure? Not too different from scripts. Get a template from the internet. You will have matched two people in virtue, as they say. - There's a problem. - What? Witnesses. You're here. And the lady. The law says two men. I'm a woman, which means half a man. What's with the accuracy, Rabab? The marriage has to be fully halal. I'll solve this for you. Call Jimmy. Of course it will be Jimmy... Yes, where you at? At the police station, too? I was there, too. Listen, I want you here in Basateen in exactly one minute. "Whereas the two parties have agreed, in the presence of both witnesses" - You're my dear uncle... - Sign here, Jimmy. - Easy, Mr. Marriage Official. - I'm easy going. How did you come out of the station with this joint? It's the only piece that survived. The government slapped me on the face, man. And you're happy with that slap? What's wrong with a slap? At the end of the day, we do as we please. Plus, isn't all this a slap on the government's face? - For sure. - You see! - Jimmy's brain weighs in gold. - Thanks, man. Where is the bride? Bridey! People! A loud ululation, Toutou! - Congrats, Totto. - Thanks, Jimmy. We're family now. - Come Tahani, sign here. - Enough already. Go ahead and kiss the bride. Kiss the bride? Not in front of you all. Are you going to kiss her or should I? Don't bring up the past, man. - Kiss her for the picture! - Kiss her, man! Let's all take a picture. Alright everyone together. Ready? Let's. Another ululation. Didn't I tell you let the day take you anywhere? It brought you here. It brought me to your uncle. And what a handsome man he is! What happened to your face? I'll tell you later. - A government slap! - A government slap indeed. - I'll take off. - Thanks for coming Jimmy. Keep this between us, okay? - Congratulations. - Stay with us. - Stay man. - I can't, my friends are waiting. - Bye. - May we meet in happy occasions. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Don't talk about this, yeah? - Toutou! Congrats. Bye. Here, have this and I'll leave. I should have left with Jimmy. No, I'll drive you. We're not going to consummate our marriage first? It's like you can't wait. - Nice to meet you, Rabab. - Same here. - Don't sleep. - I won't, get it over with already. I was dying to see Mohamed Bey's face when we walked out of the station. He was so pissed. And that officer, Hassan. His name is Marei. I mean the one who took money. - Yes, his name is Marei. - His name is Hassan. Toutou gave him Hassan as a nickname. - Shit! - What are you doing? This is my source of income! What are you doing? That's not cool man! Don't drag me like this. Take off your shirts. - Okay, okay! - Quick! - This is the shirt. - Fast. - Lean back. - Okay. "For women art but ropes of seduction... Causing the loss of thy traditional honor." - Do you understand the poem? - I don't understand anything. - What about you? - No, boss. What about you, girl? Take this off, too. Alright. What the poet means is the following: "If you have any honor... Assuming you do. Following women will make you lose that honor!" Can we just understand who you are and what you want? I'll tell you more. - Just for that nice shirt of yours. - The shirt? The lady Tahani, is bringing her clients at home, in broad daylight. Like there's no men in this neighborhood. If you think... no one has authority over you, you're dead wrong. She's dead, what you about you pretty naked girl? - Answer! - Dead wrong. Please, just tell us what you want. I want you to know deep down... that hope is non-existent. Hope is what? Non-existent. Look, whatever you want, we'll do whatever you want. Obviously you'll do as I say. "Thee see people... If we walketh, they followeth in our footsteps. If we only nod, they stand still." Whatever you want, and I can bring it for you. Now, he's pissed. Hold this. Pull your legs back. You want to bribe me? Alright let's see. Go ahead. Humiliate me again. - I don't mean to. - How much you want to tip me? I don't have any money on me, but if we go to the nearest ATM... If I hear your voice again, I'll ruin your face. Ruin... your face. Amen? - Say Amen! - Amen. - I didn't quite hear that. - Amen! Stand up! - No, no, no! Please! - Keep him away! What did you just do? You're throwing rocks at me, Rabab? When you want to talk shit about someone... don't pick someone like me, with nothing to lose. What people don't know is that you're making my life hell. Sending men you owe money. Shut your mouth! Shall I tell everyone what you did last Saturday? When you jumped into my bedroom window in the middle of the night. Shut your mouth I don't want to hit you. - Really? - Shut your mouth? When you jumped into my bedroom window in the middle of the night, Bizra. I said shut your fucking mouth, I don't want to hit a woman! Does the rooster know how to please a hen? He barely lasts three minutes. Is that all you got? Will that make people forget what I just said? No actually, now everyone knows why he's being so defensive. Oh, continue, please! Come this way and make a circle around me. - Make a noise about it. - Enough, Bizra! Are you going to beat up the whole neighborhood? These are dirty people and they must be taught a lesson. Enough, message delivered. Get up you two and get out of here. Let's go! - Let's go. - Let's go man! Take your clothes and get out of here, boy. Go, don't look at me. Just so you know, I am not finished with you. Your three minutes are over. - No, Mr. Mohamed, I can't. - I've told you not to. - No, this won't happen. - Please, Mr. Mohamed... - Mr. Mohamed... - That's enough! Get out of here already. Go, Mostafa. Show is over, everyone. Move. Bizra! A beautiful and happy morning to you all. As we welcome the brand-new morning, we hope everyone had a lovely calm night. We're with you during the morning hours. If you want to share your stories, call us, tell us what happened to you. Listen, just drop me off here by the metro station. Why? I can drive you home. It's one station, man. Go home. I never meant to put you through all this today. I'm not upset. Thank God. Hopefully we'll meet on another project. See you soon. Mr. Moe! How are you getting home? Do you have any money? - No! - See? - Here's some change. - Thanks. You know what's really bothering me? What? She was such a tease! "Do the rest of the people feel happy? That's a broader question. The Private reflects the Public. And the Public screws the Private. And the two drown in misery. But sometimes I watch a couple in a public place, or a woman hugging her child, Or two friends window shopping and laughing about an inside joke. I find that others feel happy. So I look at my own situation and ask, Why me? And why not? TO SAMIR FARID... Subtitle translation by Yasmine Shash
