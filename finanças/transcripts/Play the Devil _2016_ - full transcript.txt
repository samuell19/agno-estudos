- And we took the horse to the water, 'cause we knew it was thirsty. An old fool tried to make it drink. No luck. It whinnied, and extended itself. It pranced and it kicked and it bucked. We were in a far place. He also was smooth and moved well, and I could feel myself. We traveled to the other place to meet the other stream, but it wouldn't drink. So I killed it. Because it was this immediate horse. The horse should drink. The horse must drink. Because old fool thought it needed drink. An old fool knows what's best in the world for everyone. - I just wanted to congratulate you on an exceptional performance. I'm James Young. - Oh well thank you sir. Gregory White. - I've invited the cast back for some drinks. Michaela, my daughter, is in the chorus. - Oh, right. - I'd be delighted if you could join us. - I'd love to, but, I have no transport arranged for later tonight. I live quite far, so. - That's not an issue. I can take you home. I look forward to seeing you. Tempting town. It's my local artist, Jackie Hankson. It's part of this series, Christ in Trinidad. I love it. He didn't wanna sell this particular piece, but I made him an offer he couldn't refuse. You say you're from Paramin? - Born and raised. - Aye, you go to school up there? - I'm at St. Matthew's College. - Oh, really? - You sound surprised. - Oh, just that nephew didn't get into St. Matthew's. You must be a bright young man. - Oh. I do okay. - Apparently a bit better than okay. How did you come to star in the play? - My English teacher encouraged me to audition. - Ah, she saw your talent. - I think she felt I needed a challenge, actually. - It's a good thing she did. You were really something. - Oh, thanks. - I'd love to see you dance the Jab. I'll have to come up to Paramin on Monday. Oh, Mel. Have you met our guest of honor? - Melvina. - Gregory. You have a lovely home, Mel. Thanks for having us all. - You recognize him, don't you? He was the star of the show. - Well James and I try to go to the theater as much as we can, don't we, darling? - It's getting quite late now so I should probably be getting home. - Certainly, I'll just get my keys. I won't be long. - This is a nice car. - Yeah, I certainly appreciate it on these roads. - May I ask, what do you do for a living? - I'm a businessman. I run the family business. Construction, mostly, but we dabble in other things. What do you wanna do when you finish school? - I'd love to be a photojournalist, but, my grandmother wants me to study medicine, so. - Oh, you like photography? - I want to travel and love taking pictures, so, it seemed a good fit. - What sort of camera do you use? - Um. I actually just use my phone. - So what are you gonna do? Are you gonna study medicine, or photography? - I don't know yet. I can get a scholarship abroad to do medicine, but there's nothing for photography. - I see. - I live just here. Thank you for the lift. - Oh, it was my pleasure. Hey, don't be a stranger. That's my cell. Give me a call. - Thanks, mate. - I was wondering where you went. - Sorry, Grammy. Went by a friend's after the show. - So, how was the closer night? - It was great. - Yeah? - Everyone loved it. - That's fantastic, Greg. - Grammy, you know you shouldn't fall asleep on the couch. Go to bed. - You coming with me tomorrow? - Why are you asking like I have a choice in the matter? - You're just a good boy. - I know, and we all need more time with the Lord. - We all need more time with-- - The Lord. ♪ You are my God ♪ You are my savior ♪ Thank you my Lord ♪ For guiding me ♪ You are my God ♪ You are savior ♪ You wash away my sins in this here river ♪ ♪ You are my Lord ♪ You are my savior ♪ Your heavenly love will set me free ♪ ♪ Your heavenly love will set me free ♪ Fa-- - Hey, Greg. It's James here. Listen, I'm headed to Central on Saturday. I thought I could bring my camera. You could join me and take some photos. Let me know. Isn't he beautiful? Come on. Hey. - I love your camera, boy. - It suits you. - I got some really good shots, too. - You'll have to show me. - Well, only if you're showing me yours. - I can't remember the last time I took a photo, Greg. I wouldn't know where to start looking. - Why'd you stop taking pictures? - I stopped doing a lot things when I came back here. - Back from where? - England, boarding school. And then, kind of hanging around, trying not to come back here. - Why you come back? Why not stay? - My father. He wanted me to come back and take over the business and there's no arguing with that man. Here I am. - At least your father cares what happens to you. My father don't care. - Don't say that. That's not true. - No, it's true. No matter. I don't need him, so. - I'm sorry. - I really want to study abroad, though. - Well maybe medicine's your ticket. - I guess. It's just not in my heart, you know? - You should listen to your heart. If I could do it all over again, that's what I'd do. You ever been to Balandra? - Actually, I have. Once with my mother, when I was young, yeah. - I got a beach house up there. I was thinking that we could go up there and hang out, spend the night. Look at some photos. It'll be fun. - When? - It'd have to be this weekend. Next weekend's-- - Carnival. - Someone's gotta play the Devil. - I think I could make that happen. - Cool. Give me a call, let me know. - You can just let me off here, actually. This is fine. - Not going home? - No, I think I'll pass by a friend's first. But thanks for the opportunity. The day was real good. - I'm glad you enjoyed it. - Yeah, I really enjoy shooting with your camera. - Why don't you hold onto it? I'm pretty sure I won't be needing it this week. - You sure? - Take it. - Thanks, James. - Gregory. Excellent test. If you keep up like this, you've got a great shot at that scholarship. - Thanks, Miss Williams. - Alright. - Hey Greg. Hey listen, my son just came home. Okay, fine, yeah, yeah. Bye bye. Hey Gregory. - Hey. - How you been? - Fine, and you? - Hanging in there. Just came home from school, I see. - Yep. - Eh, and Grammy's been coming home late these days? - She's working for a new family. Cooks them dinner, so, we don't usually see each other until after eight. - I see. Oh, you're looking good. Put on some height since I last saw you. - Thanks. - Yeah. Playing any ball? - No, not really. - You should. You'd make a damn good shooter. - You're thinking of Fayne, Dad. - Oh, is he still playing? - Less than he used to, but, he plays. - That's good to hear. - Well. I gotta study, so. - Alright, sounds great. - Hey. - What? - Pa's back. - What? - Hello? - James here. - It's Gregory. - Hey, Greg. - I just wanted to let you know that I can make the weekend. - Oh, that's fantastic. Saturday around three pm? Where should I pick you up? - You can pick me up at the junction opposite the taxi stand. - Great. - Okay. Bye. Yes, Gran? - How are you doin'? - Not so bad. Can't complain. - You're not hungry, I see. - No, not really. - You saw your father? - I saw him when I got home. - I understand Fayne had some words with him. - Fayne's looking out for you, Grammy. - I appreciate that. But I'll be fine. He's only staying a short while, you know. - Right. - When you have your own children, you'll understand. With all his missteps, I still love him. - Missteps, Grammy? That's an understatement. - It is what it is. - It's your house, Grammy. It's not up to me to decide what you do here. - I just want us all to be okay. That's my only prayer. - Grammy? - Hm? - I may go to the east coast for a night this weekend with the cast. Just a small line to celebrate the showing. - You're lucky. That's so nice. - I'll be back in time for church, too. - Don't worry. I'm sure the Lord will understand if you miss a mass. - I'll be back. - Good night, son. - Night, Granny. - Grammy, you seen my best shirt? - It needs a press. - Good to go? Here we are. I'm just gonna go put these groceries down. - You want help? - Oh no, it's okay; you relax. Have a little look around and I'll be right down. What do you think? - It's intense. - You gonna go in? - I think so. - You never told me what your grandmother does for a living. - She's a housekeeper in Maraval. She works late, so, I end up doing most of the cooking anyway. - No siblings? - One brother. - That's right, you mentioned him. What's his story? - He farms and smokes a lot of weed, so. - He's older? - Yeah. - So how did you come to be who you are? - And who is that? - Well the gifted, sensitive young man who I have no doubt will go far. Someone's to credit. - My Grammy, I suppose. She's a real bright lady. - You love her a lot. A toast. To the beginning of something special. You could have brought a lady friend. If there is such a person. - Oh, no, there's no one like that. - Why is that? Such a talented, good looking young man. - My focus is in school. Girls are stress, so. - You've have a girlfriend before, though? - Of course. - Ever been in love? - No. I don't think so. - When we first married, I thought I was in love, but, I don't think it was love after all. Certainly not the kind of love that poems are written about. - What kind of love is that? - We haven't been lovers in over a decade. I have no passion for my wife. - So why do you stay? - Michaela's my everything. I stay for her. - Do you want some more? - Thanks. We should have a look at your photos. - I'm nervous to share these. - You're nervous? You're just getting used to the camera. There's no pressure here. - Okay, well like I said, there's only a few strong pictures anyways. - Okay. - Okay. - See? I love that. - Ah, thanks. I should have gotten closer, though. - That's interesting. - Yeah, I asked him to pose like that. Thought it'd make a strong portrait. - Look at those eyes, and those lines on his face. A sign of a hard life. Now that's my favorite so far. Really strong image, Greg. - Oh, thanks. - And who is that? - Oh that's my boy, Dev. - That's right, you mentioned him. - Yeah, we were just mucking about, yeah? - He's good looking. - I guess. - Not a St. Matthew's boy, I can see that. - Yeah, no, not exactly a scholar. I guess that's it. - Your images are really stunning, Greg. More than just a few good shots. - You're just saying that. - Why would I? - 'Cause you like me. - What do you wanna do now? - I'm good with whatever. - We'll watch an effect? You like porn, Greg? - Sometimes. - You uncomfortable? Sorry, you struck me as someone who would be open to this. - What makes you say that? - You ever been with a man? You have. - I messed around with my best friend when we was kids. Nothing serious. I don't think this is a good idea. - Do you want me to stop? If you tell me to stop, I will, Gregory. Morning. Is everything okay? - Oh, fine. - I was gonna fix us some breakfast. - Listen, I really need to get back, okay? - I was thinking maybe of leaving in an hour or so. - Cool. - So, no breakfast for you? - No thanks. Not hungry. - Alright. See you at the top. You forgot something. Don't you wanna hang on to this? - No, thanks. Well out of work this week. Tsk. Come hither, hither, hither. - You want something to eat? - I'm good, thanks. - So how was the line? You never tell me. - Good. - Lots of pretty girls? - Some nice girls, Grammy. - But not good. You need to have some fun. I worry about you, thinking on things so heavy. - Life feels heavy these days, Grammy. - I know. Sorry things didn't work out with your father. - Grammy, you had to start seeing him for who he is. He's never gonna be the man you want him to be. - Alright man, I'll see you later. - You really are forgetful, you know that? - What are you talking about? - Your photos. Don't you want them? - Thanks. - Why don't you let me drop you home? - No, thanks. I'd rather take a maxi. - I just wanna talk. I wanna put all of this behind us. Come on Greg. Let me give you a ride. You've been struggling with what happened. I'm sorry. - I'm not studying it. People do things all the time they regret. The Lord understands these things. - I used to feel that way when I was your age. A lot of shame. - I didn't say I felt shame. - But you do. - What do you want from me, James? Seriously. I'm 18, I'm poor, and I have nothing. So what could you possibly want from me? - You're different. You're sensitive. You don't belong. You remind me myself when I was your age. - James, you are cheating on your marriage. - That's my brooder, not yours. - Well I can't do this, James. I'm sorry. It's not me. - I'm so glad to meet you as a friend of my Gregory. So where do you know him from again? - My daughter's in the same play as him. Michaela. I don't know if he's mentioned her. - You swear? - Yes. - I didn't get a chance. Morning, son. - Morning. - You, um, left this in my car the other day. I was up here on a project and I thought I'd swing by a drop it off for you. - I had no idea that my boy was even interested in taking pictures. He's so talented. I can't keep track. This boy is blessed. - My daughter thinks the world of him. - We've been meaning to fix the roof, but I'm trying to save a little something for Greg for school. He tell you he's trying for a scholarship abroad? - He did. That's fantastic. - They pay for room and board, but he have to get the spending money. And I know that is not easy with a growing boy. - I'm in construction. Why don't you let me get a couple of guys up here to help with the roof? - Mr. Young, thank you, but no thank you. That is a lot to do. - Oh, we do it all the time as charity for our church. It's not a big deal, honestly. I'd like to help. - Well, it's been leaking for a long time. Gregory's room is much worse to be honest. Poor soul. - Oh, could I have a look? - I'd rather you didn't. My room is fine. - Fine? Cover your room leaking like a bust pipe. - Grammy, please. - What you think Mr. Young never seen a messy room before? - Michaela's the worst. I guarantee you have nothing on her. Six sheets of galvanized should do it. - I'm late. - Where are your manners, Greg? You aren't gonna thank Mr. Young? - Thank you, Mr. Young. - It's my pleasure, I'm happy to help. - Okay, time's up. - Mr. Young, there's a Gregory waiting to see you, sir. - Uh, go ahead. Send him in. - What were thinking showing up at my house this morning? - I was just returning your images. - You should ask me first. - I'm sorry. I meant nothing by it. It's good to see you. Darlene did some research on photography programs. There are a couple of good ones on the east coast. I thought you might like to take a look. Maybe we can talk about it, if you'd like. - There's nothing to talk about. I have no money for art school. - Well that's what I wanted to talk about. Maybe I can help. - I need to go. - Whoa, why the rush? You came all this way to see me, didn't you? - I need you to understand how uncomfortable you're making me, James. - You're not the only one with something to lose here, Greg. I'm glad you came. - I want you to leave me alone, James. Please. I'm asking you to leave me alone. Yo Greg. You mind taking guest Stacey tonight, Tamara's staying by me. - Yeah, sure. Where you live? I'll walk you home. - That'll be a long walk. I live in town. - In town? - Nah, I was staying by Tamara's house tonight. I didn't realize that she and Devin were gonna-- - That's okay. You can stay by me. I have a couch. - I appreciate that. - I hope it's okay. - It's fine. - My Gran wakes up early, so, don't worry if you hear she knocking about. - Wouldn't she find it strange to see me sleeping on her couch? - No, she's cool. It'll be fine when I explain what happened. Well. Let me know if you need anything. - Gregory. Why are there sheets on the couch? - A friend was gonna sleep there. - Who is this friend? - You don't know the person. - Who is it, Greg? And where is the person now? - She name is Stacey. She's sleeping in my room. - I hope you know what you're doing, you know. You're far too gifted to get caught up in some young girl's nonsense. You hear me? - Yes, Gran. - You have a chance to do what I would have given my whole life to do. You'll break my heart if you waste this opportunity, you know? You'll break my heart. - You don't have to worry Gran, I'm gonna-- - No. I didn't think so until this morning. It's not like you to be so reckless. Tsk. - Gran I-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I'll call you back later. Fayne. - Here you go, Gran. - Thanks, Greg. You know what he is up to? - Grammy, I had no idea. - I don't know why the boy had to be so damn hard. - He took mom's death real hard. - I know, but, that is no excuse for him to be so hard to us. - I'm just saying that, it wasn't easy for him. - Well jail not easy either. Tsk. Where the hell am I going to find this boy bail, Greg? Hm? I work too hard. I'm tired. - I know, Grammy, I know. - I don't know. I work too hard, Greg. - We'll think of something to happen. Grammy, we'll think of something else. What's he doing here? - He's just showing a neighborhood man around. I was talking to him about Fayne. - What about Fayne? - Well he says he knows a lot of people in the justice system. He's willing to help us with the bail. - What are you talking about? Grammy, I, I don't think we should take that man's money. - Why not? - 'Cause it's not fair. Grammy, nothing comes for free in this world. You know that. You don't think he wants something in return? And besides, Fayne is grown. At some point he has to be help accountable for his own actions. - But the Lord says we must accept the blessings that he bestow. If Mr. Young is willing to help, I can't think of a bigger gift than that. That is the Lord at work this morning, son. - Hello? Yes, it is. Yes, sir. Okay. Friday the 11th? Fine. Yes. Yes, I'll be there. Thank you very much. That was Officer Cross. Apparently they set a court date for Fayne. Friday the 11th at eight o'clock. I guess that's when they will set the bail. - You gonna take the day off work? - I don't have a choice. Somebody has to be there. - Well I can talk to my teachers and ask for-- - You crazy? You are not to miss a minute of school over this. You hear me? - Yes, Gran. - And Greg? I want to give Mr. Young the money I've been saving for you for school. - What? - You were right. It wouldn't be fair to have him pay all of it. - Yes, Gran. - Wait a second Greg, I want to talk to you after class. What happened? - I don't know. - Did you study? - Apparently not enough. - This could really hurt you, Greg. - I know, ma'am. - Can you look at me for a second, please? If there was something going on, do you have someone that you can trust to talk to? - I think I'm okay. - Okay. Well, I'm here. If you need me. - Thank you, ma'am. - Well look who, the devil himself. - Why are fucking with me, James? - I couldn't miss seeing you play. - I asked you to leave me alone. What about that you don't understand? I'm telling you, James. I'm telling you. Leave me the fuck alone. - Leaving you alone isn't gonna change anything. Let me tell you something. No liquor, no woman, no priest, not even God himself, is gonna change the fact that you like fucking men. Stop fighting me! Stop! - James. James, oh fuck, James. James, wake up. James. James. James.
