Oh well wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to touch record? Okay, you're all set, Mama. Look into the camera. This year for Christmas, I wanted to make something very special and fun for you. So I made each of you a scrapbook. And I'm making a video. This is it. I'm making it right now. Merry Christmas, my beautiful family. Merry Christmas, my beautiful family. That's my grandma. And I'm Jennifer. Jennifer Russo. I write for a living. But sometimes I like to talk instead. I have this crazy idea that somehow my mom and grandma... are listening. Saying goodbye can sometimes be easy. Ciao. Arrivederci. Bye. Kevin is a great guy. And a great agent. Between you and me, I'm not really excited about writing this one. Breakfast. Pizza and wine. I know I said saying goodbye can sometimes be easy, but most times... it's not. I miss Grandma. And Mom. I remember our last Christmas together. Grandma and Mom were very close. I wish I could say the same about Grandpa. Unfortunately, no matter what Mom did, Grandpa didn't approve, and they fought all the time. Because of the constant fighting, Mom moved Nat and I 3,000 miles away to New York City. That Christmas was the last time we saw Grandma. Grandma was diagnosed with cancer. Shortly after, Mom died in a car accident. Grandpa focused on taking care of Grandma, and neither could attend the funeral. Made it easier for Natalyn and I to just disappear. Grandma's favorite Christmas tradition was having her four granddaughters sing. And as much as I'd rather not see Grandpa. I miss my cousins. Thank goodness for my sister. This is Natalyn. She's the funny one. Natalyn's always received attention from the opposite sex. Natalyn's confidence and insecurity come from that attention. I think my sister is a goddess. She has this superpower ability to pass out anywhere. Even after four cups of coffee. Thank you, everyone, that's my time. You did great. Please, it was awful and you know it. I gotta get outta these afternoon time slots. It's like happy hour for 40-year-old frat boys out there. Natalyn, I'm gonna be in LA for the holidays, and you're gonna be in LA for the holidays. So, I was thinking that maybe you and I could meet up at some point. I don't know. You know, I'm mainly in LA for my grandmother's funeral, and I don't know how much free time I'm gonna have, you know, with the family and whatnot. Yeah, I get that. Funeral? Totes on the same page with the funeral. That's not good. Oh, and one more thing about my sister, she deserves to find the right guy. Well, hmm hmm, I hope you have a great Christmas. Okay, and I'll see you when I get back. Okay, bye. Bye. Sorry about your grandma. Okay, so do not use any of that salami. I ordered you some more. It should be here by- You're asleep. This is Millie, the oldest cousin. She works for the family business. The Russos own the Urban Press Winery and Pizzeria in downtown Burbank. Millie is also an actress. Well, sometimes. She hasn't booked a professional job in two years. Between part-time driving and working at the winery, who would have the time? I admire her work ethic, though. She married one of the nicest guys from high school. Pete's every girl's dream. Last but not least, Stephanie. A powerhouse attorney in the making. Millie's little sister. Stephanie has always been the quiet one. She likes keeping to herself. The family worries about that, but she's got a good head on her shoulders. If there's anyone out of the four of us who has their life together, it's Stephanie. What does a smiley face mean? Grandpa asked the four of us to sing at the funeral. So Nat and I are going home for Christmas. Hey, Millie. Hey. Here we go. Wow. This is Stephanie's dorm? This dorm is nicer than our New York City apartment. My favorite baby cousin! - Mwa. - Mwa. I'm your only baby cousin. Favorite. Wow, Stephanie, I feel like I'm in a Pottery Barn. Mwa. Thank you, hi. How are you? Good, good. You're all here. Yeah. Hi. I'm just so glad you guys are here. It feels like forever since you left. And everything with school and Christmas and Grandma and. Being around you guys is exactly what I need right now. I miss you too. This is exactly what we all needed. Together again. How's Grandpa? Uh, yeah, ever since Grandma, he, um, all Grandpa does is just shuffle paperwork around. It's driving Mom and Uncle Seb and Uncle Tommy crazy. Yeah. You guys are gonna be with us there, right? I mean, it'll just be like old sleepovers. Yeah. Would not miss it. Hey, you're not gonna stay in your house with your husband? Don't start with me. I see him every day. You guys... I miss. But isn't that strange? Are you guys okay? We're fine, Jennifer. How are you and Devin? Still treating you like a queen? Ha ha, they broke up like a month ago. We're both living that single lady life. You, single? Aren't you always meeting guys on Tinder or whatever the kids use? I may be known to get a free you know dinner now and then, but I'm not having sex with all these dudes if that's what you think. No. Oh my gosh, it's Uncle Seb! Hey, girls. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry I can't be there with you tonight. I'll be back from my trip tomorrow morning. Oh. Hi, Uncle Seb, can't wait to see you. Are you excited for girlies night? Yeah. I'm bringing home a professional collection. - Woo. - Woo. - Okay, I can't wait. - Aw. - Uncle Seb. - Bye, Uncle Seb. Oh, I'm gonna pee. Oh no no no, no, no. It's a mess in there. So? The toilet's broken. So, I picked the song for the funeral, and it's Grandma's favorite, Silent Night. Can I use a printer without being yelled at? You didn't tell her? Tell me what? I'm sorry. I just, I didn't know how. Grandpa already chose a song. You all lied to me? No no no, I mean technically it was just Natalyn who lied. She agreed to be the one to tell you about the song. I'm just clarifying. Hm, thanks, Steph. Look, I didn't wanna tell you because I knew you would react this way. Me too. Okay, of course I'd react this way, and you should too, Nat, after what he did to us. Grandpa pushed Mom away because she got pregnant. Grandpa never liked our dad. Nat nicknamed our dad sperm donor. Mom didn't even tell Grandpa when she was pregnant with Natalyn. The only thing the sperm donor was good for was giving Mom me, so she thought she would get one more good thing from him. And that's... Natalyn. Because of Grandpa, things between Mom and the family were never the same. He's gonna choose the song over my grandma's and my dead body. Geez, Jennifer, phrasing. What song does he even want? Amazing Grace. Amazing Grace? When did Grandma ever play that song? Wait, this isn't right. Okay, my song actually meant something to Mom and Grandma. Okay, he's just trying to control the funeral. I mean, shouldn't he? He was married to her for 50 years. Red wine on the house. Yes, Mama needs her medicine. Hurry, faster, faster. Remember your Mr. Popular quarterback prom king senior who broke your heart when you were a freshman in high school? Well this one is mine. A walking, talking Ken doll. Jennifer, I haven't seen you since you moved to New York. How's the East Coast? Good. Okay, good. I better get back before Tommy yells at me. - Enjoy. - See ya. Thanks, hon. Well, that was rude. Please, I don't care about being nice to the biggest jerk at our high school. Okay, that is last on the list of things I care about right now. You got the better one. People change. Girls, the Uncle Tommy special coming in hot. - Thank you. - Thank you. What's the matter? Jesus H. I don't know. It's the smell. Yeah, but you girls always loved this. Take it away, please, Uncle Tommy. You're right. It kinda stinks, it does. Tony, you screwed up the Uncle Tommy special. I didn't make it. Uncle Tommy's my favorite. He's a simple guy with a big heart. He gets me. Uncle Tommy's special is the best anchovy pizza in all of LA County. To Grandma's two favorite things. The woman had amazing taste. Yes, she did. Where are they? Oh, my babies. Oh, it's good to see you. Oh. You look so skinny. Oh, stop it. What's up, girls, how you doing? Hi. How's that deadbeat dad of yours? Dad. I'm sorry, sperm donor? For anyone having trouble keeping track, let's clear things up with a visual aid. Carlito Russo married Anita. They had four children. Car me lit a, Sebastiano, Thomas and Angela. Angela married Anthony. And they had Millie and Stephanie. Car me lit a and Dad, sperm donor, had me, Jennifer, and Natalyn. Millie married Pete. You're welcome. Isn't this a sight for sore eyes? Oh my goodness, the four of you together again. What is this? Look at you. I can't remember the last time I saw you all together in the same room. New York, for our mom's funeral. Right, of course. I wish she was with us, too, honey. Big sisters are what we all need at a time like this. How you doing, Aunt Angie? Oh, honey, you know, we all made our peace with Mom's passing a long time ago. Tomorrow's just about celebrating and cherishing her memory. Yeah, I'll be right back. I don't understand why you girls aren't staying with us. Oh come on, they don't wanna stay with us. No, they should stay with us. They wanna spend time amongst themselves. They don't wanna hang around with us old farts. You're an old fart, don't call me an old fart. I tell you what. Hey. Hey, you sure we're okay in here, Uncle Tommy? Super, sure. Okay. And here you go, just take four or five of these drops and that should do the trick for the edibles, all right? What? What? I know. Probably not the best idea. Don't judge. Thank you. Don't ever say I never did anything for you. I'm gonna need this to get through the next few days of this family circus. Speaking to the choir. But just, you know, take some of that, take the edge off, nice and easy, this way you can enjoy yourself. No family drama, come here. Thank you. Oh. Hold on, Dad is here, hold on. Hey, what are you doing? I told you that we can do this with the computer now. You don't need to waste your time with these papers. Come on. You know, I don't trust those things, okay. Okay. It's a box with wires. You click a button, everybody knows your business. I like to keep everything up here. I'll take the papers, it's faster. No, please, I've been doing this for 34 years. Okay? I like this. It relaxes me. Okay. At this point in my life, I don't need faster. Grandpa! Excuse me. You're choosing the song at the funeral tomorrow? Everyone may have forgiven you for what you did to Mom. But I haven't and I never will. Okay, if you choose the song tomorrow, I'm not singing. Why did I just do that to him? I'm sorry, Grandma. This place looks amazing. Thanks. Mom and the uncles have been working really hard to get everything ready for Grandma. I'll get some wine. Are you really not gonna sing with us? No. I don't know. I mean, where is Grandpa anyway? If he's home, he's already in his room. He rarely comes out anymore. Are we really gonna sleep in our moms' old bedroom? Millie's a bed hog. Whoa! You steal all the covers. That's true. Come on, it'll be just like when we were kids. Yeah. I admit, this is kinda fun. Yeah. There's no way for me to say this without pissing you off, Jen, but... you are so totally overreacting. Well thanks for giving it a shot, Millie. This is Grandma's too. That's the only reason why I'm here. Everyone else has gotten over what happened between your mom and Grandpa. Including your sister. Don't speak for me, Millie. I don't think you're overreacting. Then get on my side. This isn't about us, though. Or Mom, it's about Grandma. I know, that's why I wanna do this. Look, you guys can forgive him, you know. It's up to you. I can't stop you. But don't think the divide he caused didn't affect Grandma. All I'm trying to do is honor her, okay. She was such an important part of our lives. Doesn't Grandma deserve a goodbye that shows and acknowledges the type of person she was to her children and her granddaughters? This memorial is not just about him. No, we all deserve to say goodbye in our own way. And it's Christmas. Let's choose a song that actually meant something to Grandma. You know, that showed who and what she loved. Not some empty choice that Grandpa is making. Well don't say that. He loved her. If there's one thing we can agree on about Grandpa, it's that. You really think that a song can make this much of a difference? Of course it can. Okay. Okay? I'm not gonna lie and say that of the four of us you weren't the closest with Grandma. And this clearly means a lot to you. So if you really feel like this is the right way to say goodbye to her... then I'm in. Grandma deserves the best. This is about... her? Hmm? Not you and Grandpa? I promise. Then I'm in too. Don't you guys think we should just talk to Grandpa first? He's not going to change his mind. He'd rather me not even sing. Okay, if you guys are really sure about it. That calls for wine for me. The four of us together again. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey, Jennifer? Whoa! I come in peace. Don't sneak up on people. Jesus, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't. Okay, how was the run? None of your business. I mean what are you even doing here Working for your Uncle Seb. We're setting up for later. Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about grandmother. Last couple weeks, I'd bring her her favorite soup. Oh yeah? What was that? Pasta fagioli. So cute. Anyways, she was really proud of you and Natalyn. She told me you were a writer now. That's awesome. She got me to read one of your articles, something about mass shootings or domestic violence. I'll be honest... it was a little bit over my head. Not surprising. But really interesting. I recently just started to find my own passion for writing. Children's books. I don't mean to give Tony a hard time. I have to go. You are my life force today. Do not let me down. Ooh, feed me. Special gingerbread men, you don't want one. Oh my God, you're getting stoned for the funeral? I am not. I just need a little something to keep me stress-free for today, that's it. What's keeping you stress-free. Nothing. Her weed gingerbread men. Jennifer. Ooh, nice, Kathy Bates. Spare me, all of you. I am a grown-ass woman. Well if I can't eat that. This is clean, right? Hello, Millie? Well I hear Pete. Yeah, precious Pete! How are you? Here. - Hi, honey. - Hey, babe. Millie says we're great, we're fine, but that's the coldest hello I have ever seen. Thank you so much. Of course. Hey. Hey, guys. Hey. It's been a minute. You never showed up last night after Millie went to bed. Hilarious. So any word on the audition? Audition, wait, what? No, I was going to wait till I knew for sure. I didn't wanna build it up, but I had an audition last week for a recurring on a soap opera. I don't want you guys to freak out, but I think I may have gotten it. I'll hear later today. My goodness, please don't say anything to anyone, all right? And don't even talk about it. I don't wanna jinx it, okay? Today is definitely not about me. You gonna get dressed? Right. I guess I'll be seeing you ladies later. Okay, bye, precious Pete. Oh hey, sorry, I forgot to put the sign out. We're closed. I'm just locking up. Okay, thanks. It's a really nice place. Yeah, you should come back when we're open. I really gotta lock up here, though. You should leave a pizza out for people to try too. That'd be nice. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Who let you have bangs? Hey, Stephanie? Yeah? What are you doing? Getting some reading done for school. I'd like to rehearse without Grandpa hearing us. I just saw him leave with Uncle Tommy. Good, all right. It's for you. Thanks. You're welcome. There you are. Thank you. Ready? Mm-hmm. One, two, three. Hello, Uncle Sebby is in the house. And, nobody. Hello? Hello? What the? Everything looks nice. Not one single niece here to greet me. This is an outrage. Uncle Seb has impeccable taste. Good at what he does, loves bossing people around. Especially Uncle Tommy. Knock knock. Oh, it's so good to see you. Hello, hello, good to see you. Hello, sweetheart. Oh, oh my gosh. My gosh, you have more style in your pinkie than I do in my whole closet! Well that's just tragic. Oh my gosh, look at my lovelies. Oh, you brought the holiday season, and the East Coast humidity. Good for the grapes, not good for the hormones, you know what I'm saying? Ooh. Uncle Seb lives at home and takes care of Grandpa. He has impeccable taste, especially when it comes time to wine... he was mom's favorite. How was your trip? Good, besides being in the red state of Florida. Splendid, but I did find buyers for the summer edition red wine, yes. So that wine will be sold. Great. Glad to be back, though. Yeah. No place like home for the holidays. Get to spend some time with my nieces. And remember Mom, so. You know what? No, no no no, no. Your grandmother would not want us moping around like a bunch a crybabies during Christmas. It's true. You know. So I have an idea. Grandma used to always love to pamper herself and get gorgeous, especially after chemo. It was one of the only things that she looked forward to and it made her happy sometimes. So I say we have a beautification session in her honor. - Oh. - Yes. Aw, we used to love playing dress-up as kids. To Grandma. Okay, hold on. Almost got it, and then. Hey look, this is the new label. Ooh. Wow. All Mom's idea. Isn't it gorgeous? Yeah? So proud of it. Oh wow, that's beautiful. We're gonna be serving it at the reception this morning. That's nice. But, I think we should do a taste test. What do you think, ladies? Um, absolutely. Duh. It would be irresponsible not to try it. Maybe we should finish what we already opened. All right, I'm on board. Here we go, to Mom. To Grandma. I love you guys. Love you. Who's Casper? Oh my God, invade privacy much? I am a curious person. Nosey's more like it. Okay, we were together in New York, and he just happens to be in LA for the holidays too. Like, it's no big deal. And just happened to text you 10 times today? Is that what the kids these days are calling a booty call? The kids? You're in college. No no no, no, no. It's not like that. We're just friends. Sure. Sure, mm. This was our mom's. Where did you get this? My dad found it a few months ago while he was cleaning out their house. I thought it would make the perfect secret Santa. I thought she'd lost this. I love it, thank you so much. Yeah, of course. What are you doing? I'm not gonna wrap it now. Wear it today. Your mom would have loved it. Aw, it looks beautiful. Perfect, it is just perfect. Who is my secret Santa? If we told you then it wouldn't be a secret. Well, that's true. I'm sorry. I have not been a good cousin or sister since I've been here. You have been awfully judgmental about me and Pete's relationship. I know, I'm sorry. I guess I should apologize too. If I'm being totally honest, things aren't totally great in my marriage. Why, what happened? It's so dumb. It's just, lately I can't help but wonder, if my acting career would have been different if I was on my own? You know, if I didn't have anyone or anything to worry about, just... me. Plus, he's way better at this whole marriage thing. It's really unfair. Well you know he loves you no matter what. No, I know that and it's, this is probably just the wine talking, I just, I, I never pictured my life being so damn predictable. I'm a virgin. My gosh. Seriously? Yeah, seriously, okay. Don't act so shocked. I mean, having a pair of Double D's makes me see how much men have in common with pigs. I mean, come on, Millie? You get it. Um, I... haven't been doing that well in school lately. I, um, I got a B on my last exam. Come on, boring. What is her life? I swear to God in everything. This is where you're hiding. Thanks for leaving me down there. All right, the servers have a few more minutes before they finish setting up, and then I have about five minutes before I have to put out another fire. Who's got wine? We do. Oh, you gave it to her early. Yeah. You remind me so much of my sister right now. You both do. Do you think Mom and Grandma are watching us? If they miss us as much as we miss them, then definitely. Let's honor them right today, yeah? Anybody hungry? Always. Let's go. Thomas, under the rug, under the rug. Someone's gonna fall and break a bone. Or worse, something in the house. Tommy, Tommy, not Thomas. What's your plan for changing the song without Grandpa noticing? Let me handle it. Okay. Hey, you look beautiful, Jen. Thanks, Uncle Tommy. You need some help. No, help? But I could use a little company, though, huh? Okay. Come on, bring it in. Don't you think? Yeah. All right, get this show on the road. So have you talked to Grandpa today? No, I don't think anybody has. Okay, great, so I talked to Uncle Seb, and according to Grandpa, he now wants Silent Night instead of Amazing Grace. Are you sure about that? Positive, I can get Uncle Seb if you want. No no no, it's okay. I can, uh... I'll change it, all right? Okay, cool. Okay. Millie? What? Yours, I presume. Oh, no, it's Stephanie's. Well can you please take it upstairs? Yes, I can. Thank you. Welcome. Nothing out of place for you today, Mom. What? Mission accomplished. Millie? Huh? We're all set. Oh, good. Yeah, but most importantly, did you see Tony out there? Ooh. Yeah, and? I can't escape this guy, okay, first this morning, now here. Don't be basic, Jennifer. He's really a great guy, and he's the best employee we've ever had. And, he's helped your grandmother a lot out at the restaurant when she wasn't feeling good. Hey, Grandpa. I just wanted to let you know, I will be singing this afternoon. That's so good, sweetheart. It's gonna make your grandmother very happy. The kids are gonna sing. Of course they are, Dad, of course they are. Natalyn, hi. Casper, what the hell are you doing? Who's that? I don't know. Oh, maybe it's the texting guy. Hey, listen, I'm sorry that I told them about your audition. It's fine. What the hell are you doing here? You can't just show up to a funeral. It's creepy. No, I was invited. Are you stalking me? No. You never responded to any of my texts. I thought you might need the support. I mean I haven't had the time to look at my phone. Okay, what, why am I explaining myself? I'm sorry. Do you want me to go? Yes, I want you to leave. Oh. I'm sorry. Just stop saying you're sorry. Can I still see you later sometime? Yes. Okay, maybe, I don't know, just, can you just go, please? Just leave, now. Okay, sorry. Just leave. Hi, family. Okay. I wanted to thank all of you for being here today. I know that for some of us it was a difficult trip. Dad has asked me to speak on behalf of the family. I wish that my, I wish my sister and my mother could be here today to see all the family again together, but they can't be. If there's one thing my mother cherished more than family, it is Christmas with the family. Sometimes, we look back and wish that we could do different, things differently. But I know that my mom would have no regrets. Sebby, I can't. It's okay. So, the family would like to invite our nieces up to enjoy their angelic, beautiful voices, invited by their grandfather today. Come on. Thank you. One of our earliest memories is of Grandma singing this song for us. She would always say that, no matter the season, Silent Night was always the song that would keep her calm whenever she would sit still. I know you're smiling now. Do you wanna hang this on the tree, Jennifer? What the hell was that Thomas, Tommy? What, what? The girls were supposed to sing Amazing Grace. Sorry, it was my idea. I thought everyone here would love this. Jesus Christ. Girls, that was beautiful. Thank you. It really was. Took my breath away. Thanks, Mom. I didn't think I could feel so close to Mom again, but I did. Dad couldn't have picked a better song, you guys sang it beautifully, didn't they? Absolutely. Tommy, love you. And the first Christmas I can remember, sitting by the fireplace with Sebastiano, when Mom played that song, it was beautiful. You guys did a beautiful job. Wine, wine, wine. That's the way to do it, huh? To Mom. To Grandma. Oh here, you can have some of mine. Oh no, I'm good. No. Okay. - Look at these. - How cute are these? Yeah, they're a little burnt, but. A cookie, get me a cookie. You're fat. You can't have one. Oh my God, this is so good. Looks delicious. It does. It is delicious. - Millie? - Yeah? It's your manager. Oh my God, the audition. - Oh! - Oh my God. Hello. Okay, so Pete carries her phone for her? God, I wish he had a brother, or two or three, I don't know. Hey, Sean, sorry, yeah, I found a quiet spot now. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you. So what did he say? Oh, girls. Girls, girls, girls. Sh, sh, sh. Mom, are you okay? I feel wonderful. I do. And I don't know why, because I miss my mother and I miss my sister. I miss you girls. I do. It's okay. Do you remember Mario? This is Mario. He is... your great Aunt Amelia's second cousin to Grandma, twice removed. Or was it first cousin? I can't remember. I don't know. Doesn't even matter. Doesn't matter, does it? Oh, sweet Mario. Yep, mm-hm. Hi. - Hello. - Hi. So your mom was just telling me... That's funny. She was just telling me that you're in law school. I was. Yeah, yeah, I've got about a year left. Great, I have a couple of questions. Just legal stuff, do you mind? Sure. Okay, so, let's just say that a friend of a friend finds out that his, her boyfriend is cheating on her. And let's just that friend of a friend wants to take a bat to that lying piece of crap's fugly car. Oh dear. What would the sentence for that be exactly, like if they got caught? You know, like community service? I'm studying civil rights law, so I can't help you, her. Right, right. Oh. Why didn't you get me some salami? What's wrong with you? I'll take one of those. Are you ignoring me? No no no, don't eat that. Girls, look, hey, look who I found. Look who I found. Look who I have found. This is fabulous. There you go. Who are you? It's not that hard. I'm the great great granddaughter of Alphonso, who's your mother's first cousin. Hey, did you know that? Did you know that? No, Mom. Nicolette, what have you been up to? So you do know her? You just introduced me to her. Oh, that's right. I was in a rehab program for the past two years. No. What were you in for? Food. Anchovies are my favorite. Are you okay. Do you want me to take this? Sorry, it's like a bug or something. Hey, don't get us sick, sweetheart. This is Grandma's funeral. Sorry. So, I saw you talking to that guy outside. Boyfriend? No. That's just Casper. We're just friends. Friends, friends, friends. Actually, kind of, I don't know what we are. Boring. Hey, take it easy on the judgment calls over here, because people could judge you for those pants you're wearing, Mario. Wow. So, are you seeing anyone, any rich lawyer guy? Uh. I met someone like a month ago, but it didn't work out. So. Why didn't you tell us about that? Honey, did you know this? Mom, she doesn't tell me anything. I'm going to get a wine. But, I got wine. Why didn't you tell us about him, honey? It wasn't worth talking about. Well, it's always worth talking about, honey, come on. Jen, any boy? No, no one special. I'm hungry. Is anybody hungry? This is the way you wanna deal with this? This is exactly how I wanna deal with this. Nice. I'm so sorry. They're so good. I baked them myself. I haven't eaten all day. No judgment. Um, I was completely rude to you earlier, and I want to apologize. It's fine. You had a lot on your mind. I did, but it's not fine. I really am sorry. Okay, apology accepted. Good. You're great. I mean, you were, you were great earlier, when you were singing. Why thank you. Oh-oh. Little gingerbread men. I already had one of those No, Uncle Seb. So good. Ooh. Little mistletoe. I gotta get back to work. Scare him away. Gingerbread. I'll take that. Jennifer made special gingerbread men, okay. No, no, no no no no. Yes, yes, yes. Probably should have hidden this better, don't you think? Oh shit. It's okay. How many of these did you make? Five. Five, there you go. Two down, and three to find. And I think we found the third. It's all right. - Uncle Tommy? - Yeah. I owe you an apology. No you don't. It's not the first time someone used me. Not the first, won't be the last, but you girls were doing something you believed in. You loved your grandmother. How could I be mad at that? And I meant what I said about the song. Come here. We gotta find one more gingerbread man. All right, let's do it. I'll look inside, if you wanna look outside? Yeah, solid. Cool. Get yourself together! You are stronger than those little men. You have a cookie too? No, I don't like them. You don't like cookies? Those cookies were good. I'm sorry you didn't have any. Well I wanted one. But look at these pants. They're like scuba. They're like a scuba suit, look at these. Just leave the guy alone. Mario, sweetheart, you look fabulous today. You gotta be kidding me. Are you kidding me? Tommy, what is going on? Why am I so hungry? Honey, you're baked. You are baked. I bake. I told you to give me one of these cookies. You want me to bake, I'll bake you some cookies. Somebody put stuff in your mommy's cannoli, oh my God. Hey, give me some of that food. Are there cannolis? Are there cannolis? I want a cannoli. I'm gonna have a cannoli. Are they cannolis? Are they cannolis? Hey, are you all right? The wall's moving. Who are you? Nicolette. Oh, yeah. Don't you see it, Cousin Tommy? Where'd you get that, huh? Don't send me back. Naw, no, no way. I got it, yeah. That's far out, huh? I know that you changed the song, Jennifer. And Tommy was never a good liar. I was just doing what Grandma would have wanted. You're just like your mother. Get out. No. Why? Because Mom had me without a husband? I'm here because my mom loved me. It's not my fault I was born. I deserve to have a relationship with my family. You just let Mom leave. That was her choice. She needed you. She just wanted you to tell her you loved her. And you let her go. I'm not having this conversation. Why did you let her go? Grandpa, tell me why you weren't there for her! For us! I'm sorry. You're sorry? I'm not doing this. Jen? Jen? People make mistakes. Sometimes you just have to accept it and move forward. We all deserve second chances. I don't know if I believe that. I think you should go back inside with me. Absolutely not. It will be okay. I like it here. I like feeling that I'm a part of a family again. Grandma... taught Mom how to be brave. That's why Mom left, and that's why I'm leaving. If you don't stop living in the past, then I don't know how to help you. She didn't get the part. Oh God. How much has she had to drink? Enough. I got it, Dad. You think Jen's okay? She'll get over it. Maybe we should go find her. Natalyn's got it. They're sisters. Maybe you wanna like slow down, a bit? Now you just sound like Pete. Want me to give up on my dreams, too, just to pay some bills? Okay, I understand that you're upset about the audition, but there's gotta be... Oh look, a little angel has come down from heaven to hand out life lessons. Is that what this is? You have some secrets of your own, now don't you, Steph? When were you gonna tell Mom and Dad that you're pregnant? When were you gonna tell me? Oh my, how did she find out? And you're looking at giving it up for adoption. Stephanie, when were you gonna drop that nugget on your family, huh? That's enough, Millie, stop it, stop it. Take it easy on your sister. Millie, Stephanie. Steph. Thank you all for coming. If you wouldn't mind, we're gonna scale it down just to immediate family. Nicolette, thank you so much for coming, honey. Thank you so much, thanks, thank you. Thank you so much. Mario. Thank you, Mario. Thank you, honey. Thank you so much for coming. Bella. I'm so sorry. Sorry. - Ciao. - Ciao, baby. Thank you so much. You know, this? This right here? This is what killed Mama. Sebi! I'm sorry. What's the matter? Why'd you do this to your sister? Let Anthony handle it. C'mon let's worry about yourself here. You know what, you take it easy too. Did she say where she was going? No, she didn't. I'm sorry. I, I don't know what happened. All right, listen, I'm glad that you're sorry, okay, but it's not me you owe an apology to. I know. Look, we know you're strong, okay. We know we don't have to worry about you. We know you can handle anything that life is thrown at your way. But Stephanie on the other hand, she still needs our guidance. And yours too, you're her sister for God sakes. Now, you on the other hand, you're tough as nails. But what you did and how you did it was wrong. Yes, sir. I guess saying something was right. Okay, okay, enough. Enough, look at me. Wipe those tears. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, Mama. No, no more sorries. Okay. I could probably offer up some help. You know, make some calls down to the station. Yeah, I think that's good, yes? Why don't you just be with your wife? We'll keep you posted, all right? Okay. Could you just get me some coffee please, babe? Listen, we're gonna go look for her, okay? Okay, I'll be right there. I love you. I love you too, Mom. Jen won't even talk to me about it. And, you know what? I don't blame her. What kinda sister am I? We'd all like to think we'd be brave and strong in tough situations. But, the truth is, life's not easy. And finding our way in this complicated world, while staying true to who you are and where you come from, it's what we're supposed to be doing at our age. It's human nature to screw things up and say stupid shit. I mean, look at me. You didn't screw things up. Maybe, but I definitely do things without thinking them through. Like the funeral. You coming was actually, like, really sweet. Can I confess something? Uh, sure. That show I said I had was 100% a lie. Why? Why would you lie? To impress you. Oh, that's so stupid. Exactly, it's human nature. But you know, what about? Just don't hate yourself for being human. Please, I make 100 mistakes a day. Granted, they're not as big as yours. But... it doesn't matter the mistake you make. What matters is what you do after. I have seen you and your sister. And siblings, they put each other through so much. And it makes the rest of life like a piece of cake. I've seen what you two have. And I just wish I had the semblance of that. I bet you've been waiting a long time for that. Since the first day we met. Hi. I can't do this right now. Just give me five minutes, please. I don't wanna fight. No, I can't. Grandpa, I just wanna apologize. I'm sorry for, for everything. Don't be mad at Natalyn, Stephanie and Millie. The song was my idea. I learned a lot about myself today. This might come as a shock, but despite your relationship with Mom growing up, your marriage with Grandma was how I judged all relationships. The love you two shared, something I always wanted. I didn't stop your mom because I was scared. After all those years of fighting, I thought I was doing the right thing. I was finally willing to let her go. And the chemo, well it slowed your grandmother down. But losing your mother is what killed her. She stopped fighting. You know how I always say you're like your mother? You're like your grandmother. If you're willing to forgive me for today, I'd like us to start over. There's nothing to forgive. I'm so proud of you. Of all the girls. You did the right thing. I wonder if Grandma is watching us. Oh yeah. You can bet she's right here right now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said. Just enough, enough, enough. You know I'd do anything for us. Yeah? Yeah. I can't do this anymore. I've been nothing but supportive of your acting. Tonight was just... It's not just tonight. It's every night. It's every day. It's the way you look at me. It's the way you don't. Pete... I'm a failure. I'm disappointing myself and everyone I love. And I keep blaming you for everything that's wrong in my life, and that's, that's not fair to you. Because the truth is, you deserve so much better than me. It was just easier to, to push you away than to pull you in. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, and not just for tonight. I'm sorry. I love you. And nothing else matters. I'm not the only one who needs to hear that. I know. Okay. Well. It shouldn't be hard to find Stephanie. You're married to a cop. Everybody, where is everybody? Hey, hey you guys. Sweetheart? Hi. Okay, I know that this is my fault, and I'm trying to make it right. I'm really sorry. Okay, all right. Grandpa, this is my boyfriend, Casper. Nice to meet you, Mr. Russo. Yeah, nice to meet you. Now give me my phone. Let's see if we can- Oh, so, where are we looking for Stephanie? That's a good question, the library? No, the library's closed, come on. The tree house? I was just there. She's not gonna be in the house. She drove off in a car. She's not answering. The church? Parlor, how about the pizza parlor, I mean. What? Why would she be there? Why wouldn't she? Why wouldn't she? Holy shit, Uncle Tommy's right. All right, well there we go. No no no. What? Let me go. Seriously, it's my fault. You do good by your sister, huh? Okay, Ma. I love you. Yeah, I love you too. Natalyn and I are coming with you. I'll drive. Thank you, honey. I'll stay. I'll stay. We'll all stay, we'll all stay. Dad, come here. Who the hell is this guy? Who is this frigging guy? You good? Yeah, I'm good. Good, I'm glad, because I need to talk to you. What? Jennifer and I had a great conversation. I'm so happy, that's good, because I need to talk to you about your other granddaughter. No. No! I'm glad I was the closest driver tonight. Stephanie, Stephanie, please. I betrayed you. And I'm sorry. I was just hurt that you didn't tell me. How did you even know? I saw the email. Look, I understand if you hate me right now. I get it. I kinda hate myself right now. And if you don't wanna talk to me, I brought reinforcements. I'm not gonna tell you what to do. You're the only person that can make that decision. But I need you to know whatever your choice is, I will always be your sister, and you will never be alone. Millie, I'm in the middle of law school. I have a career lined up. Hey. What are you afraid of? Of disappointing everyone. And I don't wanna lose my family the way Aunt Car me lit a did. Your family loves you. I'm sorry, I can't go through that. Will you please just go? You know I'm not going anywhere. On no no no, baby. No. Listen, I'm so sorry if we made you feel like you couldn't tell us. I was just so scared. Yeah, oh, honey. We're all here for you no matter what your decision is. Yeah. Hey, listen, Grandpa was just afraid. We're not afraid, just Grandpa. Yeah, dry those tears, oh, I blew my nose in this. It's okay, we're all family, right? We're all family, right, Pop? That's kind of... disgusting quite honestly, all right. Hey, you keep it to yourself and just go get some water. Want my handkerchief? No, nobody wants that handkerchief. I'll be right back. You're a beautiful girl. This was you? It was all three of us. I love my family. Me too. Group hug? What's your name, Casper? Please, make like a ghost, okay? I don't trust you. Something about you, I don't trust. All right, okay, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas. Yeah, Christmas. All right. My baby. Dad, I love you. I love you. Millie. Uncle Seb! Hey, where's Casper? Where's your Casper guy? Now we do a group hug, okay? Come on, let's do a group hug. Sebastian, get in here, group hug. Come on, everybody, I love all of you guys. I love you. Grandma would be so happy, huh? Thanks, Boss. I love my family. Thinking of Grandma and Mom. Especially this Christmas. Natalyn is happy. She learned to worship what makes her her. Give it your Grandma, that's it. Give him the big one. Natalyn wasn't the one who had to see what was right in front of her eyes. Millie accepted that life is a journey, and sometimes you have to put your time in before that big break happens. Stephanie is a fantastic mom, and a great lawyer. She has the family to help. Faith in herself was all she needed. And who knows? Maybe I found a little something for myself too. Let's get the picture. Come on, Dad. Grandpa and I found our way. Everybody ready? All right, one two three, here we go. Even though Grandma is not here, she still managed to give us the best Christmas, ever. Hey. My grandmother's wisdom. Oh, shout-out to Kevin, my fabulous agent, for his patience while I embraced my voice. See the good. Be the light. Keep the faith. Listen to your inner strength, and don't let the past define you. Merry Christmas.
