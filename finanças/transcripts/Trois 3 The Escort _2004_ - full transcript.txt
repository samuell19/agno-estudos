Your star is a no-show and you didn't have a signed deal? Evidently, you don't know who I am. I'm that motherfucker you don't fuck with. [crowd chanting] Mr. Meyer... we had an agreement. Tomorrow night, at Club Victorian, I want my $20,000. As for you, Quincy, make sure I don't ever see your fucking face again. Yeah, man, not a problem. - Understood? - It's understood. Trent... I'm sorry, dog. [sighs] Wow, you look beat. You may have made the understatement of the year, Mama. Your father's still home. [sighs] I'll be in a minute, OK? OK. [sighs] [beeps] Hi, this message is for Trent Meyer. This is Susan Sheppard from Packer National Trust. We have an urgent matter. Good morning to you too, Daddy. Glad to see some things never change. Stability is a good thing. I just read that some rapper's concert was cancelled yesterday afternoon. It was a big mess. I was glad when you quit that concert nonsense. - [man] This is... It's brand-new. - [man 2] Does it work? Yeah. Of course it works. New flask. I got this from my dad. - Silver? - Sterling silver. You'll thank me one day for making you go to law school. [Trent] I mean, I've got... I've got some jewelry, I mean. Man, you gotta give me something for that. A thousand dollars for this. That's all I can offer you. Sorry. OK. This is a Rolex, OK? It's a real Rolex. - Sixteen hundred... - Come on... This is a Rolex, man. I swear to God, if the title to this car was in my name... - I would sell this shit. - What about asking your pops? - He's gotten you out of jams before. - No way. You know my folks, man. They ain't even trying to hear that. - Let me tell you... - No, man, no. My folks? They don't even know I dropped out of college. You kidding me, man. When you gonna tell them? I don't know. It ain't gonna be now. [chattering] [dance music plays] Can I have a shot, please? That'll work. Keep them coming. [rap music plays] - Hey, man. - Hey, where's Benny? He on prior engagement. Man, I really... I need to speak to him, OK? That's only... OK. That's only $7,000. I can get you the rest. Man, Benny ain't the bargaining type. We ain't here to negotiate. Hey, hey, man. I'd rather speak in a public place, if y'all don't mind. All right? Get off me, man! -Get your ass up. -All right. We got a problem here? [man] Ain't nothing but a little family spat. Get outside with that punk shit, man. Get up out of here, man. With the quickness. Move! Sit your punk ass down, man. Don't move! [rap music continues] [woman] You look lost. What's the matter? You never seen a sunset before? Sunset? The beginning. See, beginnings... they've always been my favorite. You don't know anything about me, and I don't know anything about you. And who knows, anything could happen next. Who are you? Just a woman in search of intelligent conversation. Guess I came to the wrong place. [dance music continues] - How you doing? - Just fine, thank you. What are you, like, some kind of celebrity around here? When you write the checks, respect comes easy. Female entrepreneur. That's impressive. I said I was looking for intelligent conversation. [slow groove music playing] These are a few of my friends. I have to admit that my decision to step to you back there... was entirely premeditated. I'm just... I'm just gonna tell you... if you're trying to flatter me, it's working. Actually, it was a favor for a friend. You see, she's had her eye on you all night. Hey. - What's your name? - You can call me Kyria. I hope my inquiry didn't put you off. It wasn't my intention. I'm Natalie. I'm Trenton. You're not from the city, are you? - Why do you say that? - I don't know. Your energy feels... purified. That's me. One hundred percent pure. [both giggle] [Trent chuckles] [moaning] [both moan] Morning. Want some coffee? No. I've been so stressed lately. But you came just in the nick of time. - No pun intended. - OK. None taken. But I'm afraid you're gonna have to go ahead and go. My husband will be home soon. It's a thousand dollars, right? What are you talking about? Is there a problem? You took care of business last night, right? Hmm-hmm. Good. It's cool, Cognac. What's that? Your girl, Natalie Biel? She gave me that for services rendered. - This shit ain't fucking cool. - [laughs] - That's funny? - Oh, come on. You should be lucky I'm not asking you for my cut. OK. Question: Did you find her attractive? - Yes, but... - OK. No. Did you enjoy being intimate with her? Yes. And did you know she was gonna pay you? Look, I just don't like being hustled. I'm not trying to hustle you, Trent. Go on and take it. There's more where that came from. [children chattering] Careful, watch him, Clark. Watch Jake. Come on, little man. You can climb up there. Don't let him hang on the edge there, baby. There you go. That's it. There you go. He's hanging off the rail, about to fall down. - There you go. That's my... - Mr. Grier? You don't have to... Sit your ass down and don't say a goddamn word. -[girl] Daddy, Daddy! Look at me! -There you go, baby. There you go. I'm here with my kids, man. What you got for me? In my back pocket is a thousand dollars. I know it's not everything I owe you, but that's every penny I have. I just want an extension. I need a chance to pay you back. [bicycle bell ringing] Guess what, Trent. The streets talk. You know what they told me? They told me that your daddy's the district attorney. That's news to me. So now that I know you're good for it... I'm giving you two options. Option A: That thousand dollars can go toward what you already owe me. You can pay me by the end of the night. Or option B: It can serve as interest, and you can pay me by the end of the week. - I'll take option B. - [chuckles] You got seven days. If I ain't got my money by then... I'm gonna break your legs, your arms and your neck. - [girl] Daddy, I wanna go. - OK, baby. All right. You'll be a shoe-in for the Special Olympics by the time I get through with you. Come here, baby. Come here, momma. How you doing? You wanna meet this nice man? Look at this nice man. Say hello. Say hello. Wave at him. Jake! Jake! Let's go, little man. You are his manager, OK? Your responsibility is to make sure that he's gonna show up. No... OK, now you've got me in a world of shit, man, come on... [sighs] No... OK, OK. So call... Tell the label that you need some money. Hello? Hello? Fuck! Care to join me? I think I'm... I'm cool right where I'm at. Suit yourself. You wanted to talk, Trent, so talk. Well, you know I promote concerts. And I was thinking of promoting a series of concerts... intimately staged, of course, to take place at your clubs. You must not know who you're dealing with, because if you did... you wouldn't come with that cheap pitch. Because that's not really what you want. I owe one of my investors some money. Bernard Grier. If I don't get him his money... And you want my help. I wouldn't turn it down. I pull the strings. I call the shots. End of story. You know how to mix drinks? Yeah. Well, then you can work at the bar. [dance music plays] Get a drink? Whiskey. Never pegged you for a brother fit for a job like this, Trent. Hope those thousand-dollar tips get you to the finish line in time. But that's not what I'm concerned with today. What concerns me... is the fact that people think I gave you an extension. How the hell does something like that leak out, Trent? No, no. Now, decide. Am I gonna lie... or am I gonna keep my teeth? You got me looking real soft on them streets, Trent. I fucking gave you a presidential pardon, and you play me like this? Mr. Grier, I would never do anything... Benny! Fuck-up! [Kyria] Benny. Stay out of this. Now, you know I can't do that, Benny. Let's go back to my office. We can work this out. - [chattering] - [dance music playing] [car alarm beeps] You don't have to worry about Benny anymore. You'll be paying me back instead. [Kyria] I've had business deals with Benny in the past. He signed your debt over to me. As part of my arrangement, he won't lay a finger on you. All right, listen, I... OK, I owe you now. I know that. So whatever you need... it's on. How are you doing this evening? I'm celibate. Thank you for sharing. Any time. So who's responsible for the sad mood you're in? Your husband? Noticed your ring. Oh. [laughs] Oh, yeah. This is... protection from bad company. Can I get you another one of those? Sure. Excuse us. Well, I see you're busy. Lady's choice. [slow dance music plays] Hey, man, I got you. I'm at a city fundraiser yesterday... and I ran into former DA Anderson. He informed me that you're no longer enrolled. I dropped out. - But I can explain. - Explain it! Explain how you blatantly lied to me and your mother. It's been months, Trent. I mean, everything's always about what you want. You've been a DA for 10 years. Ten years now. But I wanna be the boss. I want to be the man on top. Everything I've done. All the money I've invested. Better off putting it in mutual funds... Wait, wait. Hold it. So you just wanna waste time peddling concerts? You going against me? I'm cutting you off. Completely, Trent! Trent, please... Trent. - Trent. - I'll come back to get my stuff. [tires screech] Hey, come on, now. So, what's up? Well, work? - What's up, man? - Seriously? - Yeah. - Thanks for letting me stay. Not a problem, dude. I'm just glad you graced me with your presence. No, man, for real. I mean, for a while I was worried, bro. I thought Benny had gotten at you. Put my stuff down. You crazy. But for real. You gotta be relieved, man... that your debts with him are gone now. Man, how you heard about that? You don't watch the news, do you? God. Dude. Benny's dead. [Kyria] I know what you're here to ask me... and unfortunately I paid that debt last night. A debt is still a debt. Come here. Right there. It's time we face the reality of this situation. What do you want me to do? What now? Party at my house tonight? [muffled dance music plays] [hip-hop music plays] Trent. What's up, man? What's going on with you? - I'm hanging in there. - Yeah? Man, come on. - Welcome to my home. - My pleasure. Could I have everyone's attention, please? This is Trent. He's a new addition to our family. Make him feel at home. - Hi, Trent. - Hello. Raven. It's nice to see you again. We met at the club. Second time's a charm. Here's some advice for you: Watch out for Tim. He'll get you in trouble. Yeah, yeah, whatever, Ramon. You're just mad because you want me and you can't afford me. - Trent. - Yes. This is Mr. Curington. He's my chief adviser. Oh, which reminds me. I've acquired a new account. It's gonna be a good year. - Excuse me. I'll be back. - OK. I think maybe that lighter's trying to tell you something: stop smoking. Whatever. - I thought you were celibate. - Oh, I am. Then what are you doing here? [scoffs] You know, you really don't understand any of this, do you? What do you mean? See, you are sweet. But see, I'm trying to figure out if you're... incredibly smart or extremely naive. Maybe I'm neither. Well.... Good luck with your training. My training? [laughing] You see these ladies? This is our consumer. She has her demands. She wants to be respected like a man, paid like a man. And, of course, she wants to climax like a man. Yet at the same time, she yearns to be feminine. And you have to find that delicate balance. [Trent] Is this Etiquette 101? Basically. I'm pretty good with the table etiquette. Growing up, it was kind of like a way of life. Sorry. [Kyria] How many women have never had an orgasm... all because they're scared to say what they want? You have to help her break that fear. Open her up. Show her the world through... a brand-new pair of eyes. In the process, you'll become her psychologist, confidant... lover and friend. You'll be the man that never judges her. You'll be the man who always understands her. But never forget. This is a job. Most people work 9 to 5, and so do we. We just happen to work the other 9 to 5. - [Mom] Hello? - Hey, Mom. - Hey, sweetie, how are you? - I'm OK. How are you? I'm good. Listen, so how do you like your new job? It's OK. It's not exactly my field. [Mom] But it is in entertainment, right? [Trent] Yeah, you could say that. I'm in guest relations, it's kind of like customer service. My job is to make sure the VIPs are always well taken care of. Oh. Well, I'm glad to hear you're making your own money, you know. Well, you sound happy. And that's all that matters. Thanks, Mom. How's Dad? He misses you. Well, I have to go, you know... I'll call you a little bit later. [Mom] OK. Bye. His daddy's Wendell Meyer. District Attorney Wendell Meyer. There's something wrong with this dude. I'm telling you. Now, you gonna start listening to me. You overstep your bounds. [knocking] Hi. Listen, I've been thinking about that idea I pitched you... and I really think you should reconsider. It's a great opportunity for your club. OK, if you don't wanna do a whole series... maybe we can just do one night. You know, test the waters. We'll see. Put the shit down here. What I tell you, dog? You ain't know what you doing. Here you are. - Think you got skills? - Come on. No skills, man. - Watch this concentration. - Come on, pick up your concentration. Shoot. -Where you at? -That's all right. It's still mine. T, you really doing this for a living, man? Word? Yeah. [singing] You a gigolo Making lots of dough Hey, it's not even like that. It's like that, yo. The hell it ain't. You big pimping, bro. You big pimping. Don't believe the hype. But I'm gonna pay for the drinks because: - Pow. - Whoo. Dog, dang. I believe what I see. OK. Man, just don't get caught up. That's all I'm saying. - I always keep it real. - You better. Let's get out of here, man. God, boy. All right, my man. I'll talk to you, all right? Mr. Meyer. I'm Detective Rome. This is Detective Lindo. Atlanta Police Department. Can we have a moment of your time, please? Can you tell us about your relationship with Mr. Bernard Grier? We're investigating his murder. I mean, I knew Mr. Grier, but I didn't know him all that well. But you did business with him. A venture that we understand went quite sour for both parties. Look, he was an investor for my concert, the Kuzzo concert. But I didn't know him socially. That's funny, ain't it, Lindo. Nothing social. That's funny. Hey, one last question: Did you think it a little odd... that your employer, Miss Bynam, and your investor, Mr. Grier... share a little history of their own as well? - What are you talking about? - Why don't you ask her? In the meantime, here's my card. I'm sure we'll talk again. - What's going on, man? - I gotta go right now, all right? - I'll call you later, man. - All right. I see how it is. Crazy. - [Kyria] Hello? - Yeah, it's me. We need to talk. OK. How about later on this afternoon? [door opens] [Trent] Hello, hello. Cool spot. But why you wanna meet me here? Because it's yours. Well, it's mine. I'm offering it to you for a while. A man needs a place of his own. So, what did you want to talk to me about? [Trent] That's a beautiful sunset. It's perfect. I've been thinking about Benny lately. Well, there goes my buzz. Hey. Honestly... I mean, I know you worked with him for a long time. But how well did you really know him? I knew that he wanted to kill you. Check it. Po-po's been sniffing around here all day. I think they be looking for your boy. When have we not gone against the cops? And we beat them at all their little games at every turn. We got rival gangs springing up everywhere. Raven and Timothy being recruited by the Pinellis. Man, that shit ain't right. I'll handle my employee issues personally. And let me remind you. Because of the dirt I have on some of the members of this city... we don't need to worry about protection. And Trent? Trent is a private matter. If you gentlemen will excuse me. So you don't love me anymore. Of course I do. I always have. You know that. No, I don't. Well, just forget it. I gotta go. What are you doing sitting outside the club all by your lonesome? - Hello. - Hi. - Mind if I join you? - Come on. So you probably think I'm always on this sad trip, huh? Oh, nah. Do you know Raven? Yeah, I know Raven. You know she's dead? What? Earlier today she... She died. Just like that. They said it was a drug overdose. Yeah, right. What are you trying to say? I'm saying Kyria is a lot like a terminal disease. What, you think you immune just because you her boy? You know, point of information, I am not Kyria's boy. I ain't nobody's boy. Yet every night she got you selling your body to the highest bidder. [turns radio on] Hey, baby. You have two gigs lined up tonight, right? Well, don't give it all away. Why don't you save a little something for me. The boss is sleeping with the employee. That means I'm stealing from my own company. [Kyria] Your birthday's coming up soon. Yeah, I know. So, what do you wanna do? Why don't you... put some thought into it and surprise me. OK. [giggling] You're weakening my authority. I see you don't knock. I like aggression. What's the matter? You miss me already? - Something like that. - Something like that. Yeah. I don't ever want you to sneak up on me again. OK. - Why don't you take me back to bed. - I think that's a good idea. No, I'm kidding. [dance music plays] Hey, come here. Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot the other day. But, I just wanted to apologize. So, did they... They set a date for Raven's funeral? You know, honestly, I doubt if she'll even have one. It's not like Kyria's gonna take care of it. What about her family? Her parents ain't the Huxtables. You know, most of the people working this set are runaways. And you? I need another drink. Can I get a gin and tonic? Thank you. You know, two weeks ago, Raven was talking about leaving the game. Now all of a sudden she up and dies of a drug overdose? Anyway, I gotta go. Kyria set me up with some special trick. This dude is from out of town. He's paying three times the going rate. Scared of you. Anyway, I just wanted to apologize about the other day. - Well, we'll talk. - OK. Hey, it's my birthday, by the way. Well, happy birthday. Thank you. So... what's all this about? It's your gift, birthday boy. I love my birthday. [laughs] Surprise. Anything you want... I can give it to you. [Kyria] So... how should we get this started? [hip-hop music plays] [door bell rings] Why are you avoiding me? You know, this may... sound crazy as hell... but you scare me. Me? You know, I always been really good at separating myself from a gig. But, um, you know, the other night, when we were together... I couldn't. I don't like how that feels. So, what do you wanna do about that? Shit. There ain't nothing we can do about it. What you think, I can just put in a two-week notice and quit? Ask for a letter of recommendation? Kyria ain't having that shit. So that's what this has been all about? [sighs] How long you been painting? A few years. Kyria thought I needed culture. She said it would raise the level of my clientele. So she told me to choose a craft. [giggles] That one's really cool. - Does it have a name? - No. That's deep. I don't think it needs a name. This one is special because every time I look at it... you know, it reminds me... You know, it's all about the simple things. You know, these are all really good. They should be in a gallery. Serious. You know, my mom has some connections. Maybe she can hook it up. [chuckles] Ow. Why are you here? Came to see you. No. Why are you in the business? Why are you? I mean, it's obviously not what you wanna be doing. Oh, you Dr. Phil now? Gonna heal me in 60 minutes or less? Just trying to learn more about you. Oh, you wanna learn about me? What you wanna know? How I was a runaway at 15? How Kyria found me fucked up at a rest spot in West Palm Beach? You ain't ready for that. So don't tell me you wanna learn about me. I was Kyria's favorite once too. Sometimes I wish she just would have left me there to die. I ain't afraid of dying. What scares me... is knowing that I gotta live the rest of my life like this. No, you don't. - Oh, yeah. - You like the chair? Yeah. Wearing the big drawers now. How you like me now? Let's see. I like you a lot. Why you gotta be weird because you're French? Because, you know... [fakes French gibberish] Stop! - I got game. - Here you go, talking... No, I got game. You ought to eat your pizza like this. - No, how you gonna just cut it? - That's how you stay neat. - That's why... - That's a damn travesty. You got to just pick it on up, and you just turn it and: - OK. - Got to, you know, just: Tastes better like that, right? I'm messing up my makeup though. See, that's what you get. [phone rings] [R&B music plays] So you're getting pretty close to Kyria, huh? You know, I used to taste that too. And not just her either. Back off, man. Where were you all afternoon? I tried to call you. My mom had one of her community service projects. That's her M.O. Pick a cause, any cause. Her assistant fell through, so she asked me to help out. Sounds like fun. How's our event coming? Closing the deal with the DJ. [mimics scratching record] I got the dancers on lock. I even got Joyce Littel from V-103's Quiet Storm to host. Let's rap. So, our friendly neighborhood gigolo. How's business? Caught any venereal diseases lately? Excuse me, is this the Victorian Club? Don't be bashful, dog. Shyness can be a hindrance in your line of work. Hi, I was trying to find my son. His name is Trenton. Oh, Mrs. Meyer. Kyria Bynam. I'm Trent's boss. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Bynam. No, the pleasure is all mine. Well, has my son been a good employee? What's the matter? Dearly departed a friend of yours? Oh, you have no idea what a hard worker your son is? He's the perfect professional. I'm happy to hear that. And what's his name? Timothy. I've heard so much about the work you do in the community. I would love to get involved in any way I can. Well, I wish I had more volunteers like you. It's been a slow year so far. The first event of the year is coming up. Well, everybody's so busy doing their own thing. Kyria got a real knack for employee relations. Most of them wind up in this same condition. You do know about her little black book? I have to get going. I have a few more stops to get in before the day is done. Take care. Whatever you're offering, I'm not interested. I'd hate for a little bird to sing to the press. Can you see it now? DA 's son by day... a gigolo by night. That'll do wonders for your pop's career and reputation. You got the number. Use it. [Kyria] So how long do you think this has been going on? If I had to guess... two weeks. Probably since his birthday. Hey, let me ask you something. What's the thing you want most in life? For people to appreciate my work. This work. And my own business, maybe. And you? Just you. You know, I can't believe we're in this business together. We're together. Yeah, something like that. I gotta go. All right. OK? [laughs] Yeah. You're late. You're a hard worker... but your timing is just off. Now... I do hope... that you plan to make this up to me. Now, close your eyes. [gasps] - Honey... - No! - Jesus... - Get up! Get the fuck up! Get up. Get in there. Go on! - Get in there! - I can explain. - [man] Shut up! - [woman] I'm sorry. [man] Shut the fuck up! I'm trying to think! - Calm down! I'm gonna explain... - I'm gonna calm down, all right. I'll fucking calm down right now! Whore. What do you think you're doing? Yeah, it's me, Trent. I'm at my appointment, and her husband came home. He's got a gun. - Get Cognac here right away. - Cognac, get in here. Trent, why did you lie to me? Where were you when you said you were with your mother? Baby, I need you to focus. I said, where were you?! What's the deal? Just a false alarm. Trent? Trent, tell me! Yeah, I have an emergency. [loud bang, crash] What's the nature of your emergency? Sir? Was that a gunshot I just heard, sir? I need your address. Listen... I'm guilty, OK? But if you shoot me, then you'll be the guilty one. - Shut up. - This is a lose-lose situation. Ain't no way around that! [woman sobs] [sirens blaring] Lena. What happened? I came here right after I got off my job. Baby, you are not gonna believe the shit that happened to me tonight. Whoa, whoa, what happened? - Go home, Trent. - Hey, talk to me. It's not so bad. A little blush here. Presto. Good as new. - Kyria did this to you, right? - No. It was a john. It was a bad trick. Don't worry. - Cognac is gonna take care of it. - Don't you do that. Don't you dare lie to me. She knows. She knows about us, OK? Tell me what happened. She called me into her office. So how long? How long have you been seeing Trent? What? - Trent and I are not... - Get this trick up. You touch him again... and your ass is gonna be six feet under. It's fine, baby, really. I'm OK. [dog growls] So listen, we've been investigating Kyria for years. Her clients have real deep pockets. So we need something that links Kyria to her clientele. Bank records, accounts, transactions. Things of that nature. OK, let's... Let's say I can get you something. You have to guarantee that my father will never... know anything about my involvement in this business. Agreed. I got one more thing. There's always one more thing. When Kyria's business goes down... I have one person that's gonna need immunity. OK. Do you have any idea... how much danger I was in last night? You lied to me. What, that's my punishment? I could have died. I don't like being lied to. This is the point where you say you're sorry, and I consider forgiving you. [water running] I don't mean anything to you. Do I? Just say you're sorry. Fine. I'm sorry. [slams door shut] What you're thinking about doing is not a good idea. Stuff like this has to be thought through. And I have. You don't need to worry about me. [dance music plays] Look, I just need to know that you are cool with it. Are you sure it's gonna be OK? Look, soon you are going to have your own business. OK? That's what I'm talking about. [inaudible] What about her alarm system? I'll have about five minutes. I'm just gonna have to make that work. Hey. - It's gonna be all right. - OK. [alarm blares] You need to get over here. Yeah. You made one fundamental mistake. You may flip the script on Kyria, but when it comes to me... game recognize game. [grunting, groaning] [yells] [panting] [Trent groans] I had such high hopes for you. And you do this? And you're walking around like you're the man? Please. [screams] What? You think because you fucked me one way, you can fuck me another? Open your mouth. Open your mouth! Now I'm gonna fuck you. How does that feel? I like endings. Starting to like them better than beginnings. See, you know everything about me. And I know everything about you. There's nothing that we don't know. [gunshot] [sirens wail] [officer] Can you please come over here? Bring him over to us. [radio dispatch] One male, one female. Male with a gunshot wound to the left shoulder. Make sure the vehicle is secured. My wife and I are honored that you joined us this evening, to explore the passion and promise of Atlanta's young artists. We also would like to applaud our son... Mr. Trenton Meyer... who is becoming quite the promoter. He is responsible for this event this evening. Trenton, would you please come join us? Thank you all for coming tonight. This is my favorite. This one. What's up? What's up, dude. Hey, bro, nice show, man. - Thank you. - No doubt. You and your pops seem to be cool, what's up with that? Yeah, we're finally seeing eye to eye. He's gonna put in his bid for mayor in a few months. You're kidding. Excellent. That means we campaign managing or what? Hey, you know, never say never, right? I won't. All right, man. Yeah. And wait, the Hot 107.9 Birthday Bash, son. Don't forget. - You can count on it. - All right, brother. Hey, how's your shoulder? It's feeling a little bit better. Thanks for asking. Nice shindig you got here. I have to say, I'm very impressed. - I'm trying to make a fresh start. - And that it is. Fresh start for us all. She's something else, isn't she? She knows how to play it right too. [man] So how much? What a difference a little notebook can make. Hey, baby. Cheers. Oh, this is a very nice tie, Officer Lindo. Thank you very much. Hey, baby. Is everything OK? How'd you get the black book? You know, with Kyria gone, someone had to fill the void. So I figured, why not me? How long have you been seeing Trent? What? - Look... - Don't lie to me, Lena. And I know it was you that supplied the drugs to Raven. And Timothy too. Wasn't he your friend? I don't like competition. I don't like competition. - Hit me, Cognac. - Listen, Lena, I just want... Look, hit me, or I ain't gonna let you taste it anymore. - What? - Stop being a bitch, and hit me! - Why? - Just do what I say! That's the only thing you good for anyway. Come on! Hit me! Whoa, whoa, what happened? Go home, Trent. The beginning. Oh, beginnings have always been my favorite. - Hi, Wendell! - Lena. - How you doing? - I'm fine. - You looking good. - Well, thank you. Trent, I need to talk to you. I got a couple of people I want you to meet. In a minute. I'll see you soon. What you gonna do? Your pop's name is in the black book. Bye, baby.
