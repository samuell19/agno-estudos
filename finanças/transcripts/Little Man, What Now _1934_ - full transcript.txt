A new day is creeping through the age. And in huge letters .. To the rising sun is the word .. Equality. A boy from the hilltops. Comes down to talk to the people. And says all men are equal. Do you like the soapbox orator, young man? I can't even hear what he is saying. - Just as well. I heard him. He said that the rich are too rich and the poor are too poor. He's going to fix things. - Yes. He is going to make the rich too poor and the poor too rich. He is going to change God's world. What time is it, mister? You are late, Lammchen. At least 16 people have gone in while I've waited. They've not all come to see the doctor. Besides, we've got an appointment. He says the rich are too rich and the poor are too poor. Does he mean us? - Yes. You are too poor having me. And I am far too rich in having you. Come. The doctor. I am so glad you are coming with me. You're not frightened? Yes. I am frightened too. Why is it that we who came first still wait? While your wife sees the doctor already. Well, that is because we had an appointment. A bourgeois, huh? And we are scum, I suppose? You wait for half an hour while his wife sees the doctor right off. Why don't you wait your turn? - I am willing to. Only .. we had an appointment. Nah. Come. We'll find another doctor. But. Dr Sesam .. is so great. Come when I speak. We'll go where people are more equal. Where each one takes his turn. I seem to have made him angry. - Who? Not you. Him. I saw them stand together in the crowd there. Each time she moved to leave he held her arm the tighter. He wanted to listen to his rights. Equality. It's best to keep one's place contentedly, isn't it, sir? Not too contentedly, young man. Ambition is alright. - Yes, I know. But .. If one is satisfied to accept his life. Peacefully. He is better off, isn't he? Indeed, yes. Nothing very wrong happens to the peaceful man. Yes. That is what I mean, sir. Nothing very wrong will happen. Herr Pinneberg. Yes? While your wife is with the doctor I'd like a few particulars for the record. Here is your check. Herr Sesam. Your son can't see you. Young man. Do you play pinochle? - No, sir. I don't know how. - Ha. You should learn how. You would find it most interesting. When you are tired of everything else. Your age please? Twenty-three. Will she be much longer? Christian name? Johannes. Women do have it worse than men, don't they. I don't know. I am not a man. Occupation? - Nor am I a woman. I am a clerk. Where? Kleinholz. A corn merchant. Where? Ducherau. Have you no doctors in Ducherau? Dr Sesam was highly recommended. We thought that .. He is a good doctor, isn't he? I mean, an understanding .. Have you ever been seriously ill? Only when I was a little boy. Measles and mumps. Your mother still living? No .. yes. Have you decided? My stepmother is alive. Father? No. What did he die of? War. Your wife's maiden name? What is your wife's maiden name? I am sorry. Emma. Emma Merschel. Well. This is Herr Pinneberg, doctor. I believe I received a very long letter from you, Herr Pinneberg. Yes. We are so grateful for the appointment. That's quite alright, Herr Pinneberg. Perhaps I should let your wife tell you the diagnosis. Don't you worry. Everything will be alright. Oh. Thank you, doctor. It will be some time before your child is born. But doctor, I thought .. We both think .. Doctor, I only earn 180 marks a month. I know it isn't much. Yet, people have lived on less than that. But .. how? That is your problem, Herr Pinneberg. Good luck, my dear. Fifteen marks. 180 marks isn't much, he said. But takes fifteen of it for himself. There are other doctors. Of course there are. - Even better ones. More understanding. More human. You are angry with me? Aren't you? - No I'm not, Lammchen. No. Of course not. I am disappointed. Aren't you? I'm hungry. At least I know now why I crave salmon all the time. Look. Oh, darling. Did you hurt yourself? Oh, dear. Joseph. Joseph. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, darling. Couldn't we perhaps manage it on 180 marks a month? Good day, Herr Pinneberg. Good day. This way please. - I've ordered a car. It's much too far for you to walk. - I thought we had to save money. How else will we get into town, Lammchen? You couldn't walk that far. You get in. I'll see about your trunk and things. Oh, can't we have the top down? It's such a lovely day. Herr Pinneberg ordered a closed car. Otherwise it would be down. But if you say so .. - No. Please don't bother. It's alright if Herr Pinneberg said so. I think I am going to like Ducherau. It is really just one long street. Is it nice where we are going to live? - I've already told you. A little cottage right in the country that belongs to the widow Scharrenhofer. Tell me about her. - Oh. She is very particular about her furniture. It is all very old. You will have to sit gently on the chairs on account of the springs. No, I won't. I'll sit on your knees. You are the one to be careful. No. And you can't wind up the clock under the glass case. I won't have to because I'll never care what time it is. They look nice, don't they. - Hmm. They were very cheap. I will always wear mine. Won't you? Yes, Lammchen. Always. Oh, driver. Stop please. Look, darling. Kleinholz and Company. Isn't that where you work? Let's get out so I .. No, Lammchen. Not now. Go on please. Because I must work there tomorrow I don't want to have to look at it today. I understand, darling. Right on the minute. Sure. And I bet old Kleinholz won't even look in this morning. If we were two minutes late that egghead would be standing there waiting for us. Maybe he isn't up yet. Don't worry. He gets up early just to see if we are on time. Good morning, Herr Kleinholz. - Morning, Herr Kleinholz. Is Pinneberg not here yet? No, Herr Kleinholz. It is just 8 o'clock, Herr Kleinholz. It is after 8 o'clock. It is one minute after eight. You yourselves should be at your desks on the hour. Not just coming in. Coffee, Papa? - Yes. Marie, why don't you get your Papa's slippers? Aren't your feet cold? Not half so cold as your coffee. Where are my slippers? Come, come, come, come. I can't stand the sight of that girl much longer. You can't stand no more liquor either. - I am chilled through, Mama. Chilled. Then put your robe on top. Here it is. It is too warm for that thing. You would make a good wife, Marie. - Thank you, Papa. Yes. You are just dumb enough to make a very good wife. What is the matter with Marie? - That's what I would like to know. Then maybe I could fix it so as to get rid of her. You ought to be ashamed of yourself talking that way. Is it her fault that no man can come to see her. Well, is it mine? Didn't I discharge three steady married men? Didn't I hire three lazy bachelors to take their places? Yes. And not one of them has taken her out yet. Haven't I hinted often enough? Haven't I told them that I'm getting old? That I want my daughter to marry so that her husband could be my manager. You told them that? - Yes. Yes, I told. I told Schultz. - I don't want Schultz, father. I told Lauderback. I don't like Lauderback. Did you tell Pinneberg? Yes. I told Pinneberg as well. I like Herr Pinneberg, Papa. There, now. There is a girl for you. You try to find a man for her. And she has a choice. Yes. Very well, Marie. You shall have Pinneberg. Thank you, Papa. - Not because he likes you. But .. jobs are very scarce nowadays. Papa, when I get older .. Will you hire women help? It sounds lucky for you, Pinneberg. He's in a better humor. What do you suppose made him laugh so? The first time in weeks. Perhaps Frau Kleinholz has painfully scalded herself. Or maybe little Junior broke his leg. Or maybe Marie just told him about her marriage to you. That's it. And she favors you too, Pinneberg. Stop it please. I am not interested in Marie. I have no thoughts for her future. Aren't you concerned about your own? - Yes. I am. Say, aren't we always? Yes. That makes me think kindly of Marie at times. I don't want to lose my job. Nor I. I don't dare lose mine. Say. Why don't we all make an agreement? Agreement? - Yah. Let's solemnly promise that we will all three refuse Marie. He can't fire us for not marrying her. Let's agree that if he does fire one of us, the other two will give notice. On our honor. I'll agree to that. I too. Well. That makes things very simple, doesn't it. By firing one. I get rid of all of you. Now, let me see. Which one shall I give notice to? Pinneberg. Why were you late today? It was my clock. You see, the alarm .. - Oh, stop. That is the worst lie of all. Schultz. If I fire Pinneberg. Do you leave also? No, sir. I said .. - Lauderback. If I fire Schultz. Do you leave? - No, sir. So that is how you keep your bargain? Well. One of you will be fired and soon. All of you know why. Schultz. You can go up to the loft and help get five tons of crushed meal into sacks. No, no, no. Let Lauderback go. He looks like his own corpse again today. Lifting sacks will do him good. He will march better tonight. Schultz. You go down to the station and order four 3-ton trucks for tomorrow morning. We must get that wheat down to the mill. Go on. Go on. You are writing about corn inventory? No. Leave that to Lauderback. But we must get busy and sack the corn. The women will help. Tying the sacks. Yes, Herr Kleinholz. Marie is very handy at that sort of thing. She is handy at most things. Not .. Not pretty perhaps. But .. Useful, eh? Certainly, Herr Kleinholz. - Yes. Marie. Marie! Life is a very serious problem for young folks today. Yes? I don't think so, Herr Kleinholz. If one is peaceful and tolerant. And minds his own affairs life ought to be very simple. Yes, Papa? Come down here. Herr Pinneberg wants you to help with the sacks. Oh? Alright, Papa. I'll be there in less than a minute. You speak of peace and tolerance. And the whole world is full of unrest and bigotry. To say nothing of poverty. If you are not prepared. Have you thought of the .. Future, Pinneberg? Yes, sir. And how do you feel about it? I am happy, sir. I have much to live for. Perhaps I don't understand, Herr Kleinholz. What do you mean? I mean the thing I have hinted about. This .. this firing business. There is not enough work for three of you here. Now, which one would you let go .. If you were in my place? - I can't say, Herr Kleinholz. No. I can't speak against men I'm working with. Would you fire yourself? Would you want to walk the streets and starve? In peace and tolerance? Yes? No. Think it over. You are engaged by the quarter. That would mean a notice on August 15th for .. October 1st. Wouldn't it? Yes, Herr Kleinholz. - Yes. Do you really want me to help you, Herr Pinneberg? Why .. Yes. That will be nice, Fr?ulein Marie. Isn't it peaceful here, Lammchen? I can't find a 4-leaf clover. Must you find one? It brings good luck. Come on. Help me find one. - No. I don't need one. I was lucky enough in finding you. You are sweet sometimes. But not all the time? No. Not all the time. I bet there is lots of clover over there. What is the matter, Lammchen? Look. Here we are in the woods with picnic and music. Yet still .. You are not happy. What is it? Suppose you tell me. Tell you what? I don't know what you want to ask. You know. I don't. Please ask. - You know. Alright. Don't then. Remember when we were married? It was only a week ago. I should, shouldn't I? Remember what we promised? - Yes. Of course. What? We promised we'd always be honest and not have any secrets from each other. You said that. Aren't you going to be honest? - Yes. Of course I will. Then why don't you begin now? Why did we have to drive from the station in a closed car? And why did you keep your hand in your pocket so people couldn't see your ring? Why can't I go to town with you at night? Why will people be offended because we're married? Why? - Lammchen. Please. I would rather not tell you. - But darling, you must. If we begin by having secrets now, we'll be telling lies soon. Tell me, darling. Is it something to do with a girl? Yes, Lammchen. Yes. But not in the way you think. How then? Tell me. Okay. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. Tomorrow will be too late. Do you think I can sleep when my brain is all muddled? From the day we arrived my heart has been tearing at me. That's not good for me now. - Lammchen. Dearest. You ask, what's the matter? Well, that's it. That's why I cry and lose my temper. I can't laugh when I am worried like this. I can't cook. I can't do anything. Because you are jealous? No, no. I am not jealous. I'm just bothered about you. That's all. Listen. Now listen, and I'll tell you all about it. Herr Kleinholz. My boss. He has got a daughter. Understand? And in order to marry her off .. He has three single clerks working for him. Now, none of us like her. But all of us know what a job means. Are you listening? Yes. - Alright. Now, the daughter. Her name is Marie and .. She is dumb in everything else except one thing. She likes me best. Do you ..? It's the other thing I'm talking about. So .. Her father has decided that I marry Marie. Do you love her? - Of course I don't. But we need my job. So. I must pretend. Darling. I am so happy now. Lammchen. Look. Look, Lammchen. Look. I found it. [ Car horn ] What is it, dear? You look as if you'd seen a ghost. No. No ghost. Kleinholz. And Marie? And Marie. We had better look out. Come and get me. - No, Lammchen. No, don't jump. Don't jump, Lammchen. Don't. No, Lammchen. No. You tickle me. Let me up. Do you love your boss's daughter or do you love your wife? My boss's daughter. No. My wife. My wife. I love my work. Good morning, Lauderback. Did you have an enjoyable weekend? What happened to you? Yeah. What's happened to the people? They've got too many organisations. Tonight, the communists. Tomorrow night, the socialists. Go the wrong night. Say the wrong thing. Fireworks. So you have been marching again, huh? You were scared weren't you? You thought I was Papa. Ooh .. did you have a fight? No. Go to .. I saw you yesterday. That brat. It isn't his fault that he is like his father. Good morning, gentlemen. You know why I'm laughing today? Why I feel so good? This is the day I give one of you your notice. Schultz, you have been drinking again. Get on the trailer behind the truck and go down to the mills. I don't know which one I am going to fire but .. I give you your notice now in case you are the one. Herr Kleinholz .. - Go on, go on. Lauderback, you're looking very well this morning. I'll be alright, sir. Yes. Yes. In a few days maybe. In the meantime, I am not paying for a black eye and bandaged arm. Go home until are better. - Yes. But .. Go home and stop marking so much. You like the woods, Pinneberg? Yes, sir. They are beautiful. This time of year. Yes? Yes. They're beautiful. Lauderback. Remember, you got a notice too. In case you are the one I fire. If only they were like you .. Pinneberg. Good morning, Herr Pinneberg. Will you clear the table for me? For the washing I mean. Yes. Of course, Fr?ulein Marie. Do you know why they say Mondays are blue? No. It's the wash day. The housewives started the saying. Good housewives, I mean. The kind that are willing to do the washing. Will you get me some water please? Did you have a good time yesterday? Yes thank you. Very nice. You seemed to be enjoying yourself in a vulgar sort of way. I felt sorry for the .. Girl. Because her kind never mean anything to you men, do they? Imagine. Kissing a girl in public. I looked back and saw you kiss her. But I only speak of what I saw. Frightfully overdressed. And so common. I am sorry for you, Herr Pinneberg. I'm sorry for you. If you are insolent I will tell Papa. I said exactly what you said. Oh. So there she is again. Parading herself. How she is made up. Disgusting. The dirty little slut. If you say anything against her again I'll smack both your cheeks for you. Why? - She is my wife. Oh. No. No. Stop. Stop. What is this noise? Father, I am so unhappy. About what? About what? That woman we saw yesterday is his wife. You understand this means your notice, Herr Pinneberg? Yes, Herr Kleinholz. Effective as required by law. - Yes, Herr Kleinholz. In the meantime I expect you to keep that person. That .. Woman away from our establishment. Well, I can do that to your satisfaction Herr Kleinholz by quitting now. Now? You are paid up to last Saturday. Have you so much money, Herr Pinneberg? I have that much pride, Herr Kleinholz. And a good wife. Here. Take those things up there. Stop your crying. You will marry Schultz. - I don't want Schultz. You will marry Lauderback. - I don't like Lauderback. I don't like Pinneberg. I never did like Pinneberg. Good morning, Pinneberg. - What luck? None. And still you smile. Why not? If I'd scowled all the months I've been out of work .. My face would get so set I wouldn't be able to smile even if I got a job. And that would be tragic. Good luck. Good morning. There is nothing here, Herr Pinneberg. You've told me that for three weeks. And for many more weeks I'm afraid. - But .. We are expecting a child, Herr Fredericks. Yes? They are a great blessing, Pinneberg. I have two boys. Girls are useless. But boys can help later on. Be sure it is a boy. - Yes. I'll attend to it. Good evening, Mrs Pinneberg. Are you asleep, Lammchen? Lammchen, come on. You are hiding. Frau Scharrenhofer. Frau Scharrenhofer. I'm sorry to disturb you but what time did Lammchen go out? Lammchen? - My wife. Did you see her? Oh yes, young man. She left before the postman came. She said she was going to the market. She isn't back and it's our dinnertime now. Maybe she is tired of the stove. She doesn't like it, you know. - It may be something else. Yes. I know. Lammchen. Why aren't you home? I was afraid to go home. Why, Lammchen? Why were you afraid? It is way past our dinner. Stop this thing, will you please? I want to talk to my wife. Didn't you go to the market? Yes. Well, did you buy the salmon? Yes. I ate it. I ate it all by myself. No. That is nothing to worry about. Tell me what happened. Well. I had such a craving for it while I waited as she sliced and weighed it. As soon as I got outside I went into the nearest doorway, took out a slice and .. It was gone. You were hungry, dear. That is all. What is a slice? Yes. But I did that all the way home. Whenever I came to a doorway. I couldn't help stopping. First, I divided it exactly half and half. And then. I ate more and more of your share. But one slice I did manage to keep until I got home. One slice? That's enough for me, Lammchen. Yes. I ate that too. In our own doorway. And then I came back to get some more. I would have saved all that for you. But I only had a few pennies left and .. And the woman wouldn't trust me. Lammchen. Dear, just stop crying. We can buy more salmon. So stop. Now look. I have an important question to ask you, so stop crying. Why did you write to my mother? I knew you needed help and .. I thought if .. What does she say? Can I read it? She says we should come. She has room for us and a job for me at M?ndels. That is a big store in Berlin. M?ndels. I have heard of it. Oh, darling. We can go tomorrow, can't we? You want to go, Lammchen? - Yes I do. I do. There is no hope for us here. Come on, darling. Let's get on the merry-go-round. What are you doing? It goes round and round and round and I get dizzy. Oh, it is good to laugh. We want our baby to laugh, don't we? - Yes, Lammchen. Always. Berlin. Are you getting tired, Yacki? So am I. I knew any train my son was on would be late. From Ducherau? - Yes, ma'am. They are here, Yacki. Now you will see your big brother. This is my dear. My boy. Kiss me. Well, I can't very well, mama. Your dog is kissing me. Now give me a nice kiss. And don't worry about my lipstick. It is kiss-proof. You are looking splendid, dear. You haven't changed much. No. The coal business must agree with you. We didn't sell coal. Didn't you write me that he did? - No. Corn. Oh, corn. Corn or coal. What's the difference? So, you are my daughter-in-law? - Yes, mother. You are not what I expected at all. No? Are you disappointed? No. Come on, lovers. Let's get a taxi. I'm a having a party tonight so we must hurry home. Did you attend to your baggage? - Yes, mama. Did you bring furniture? - No. No? It's just as well. You will not need it. Where is Yacki? Hans, find Yacki. I'll die if I don't have Yacki. Here he is, mama. Oh pet. I thought I had lost you. I was so excited. I should die if I didn't have you, Yacki. Well, here we are. What time is it, Hans? No, never mind. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. If I knew, I'd probably get all excited. I told you I was having a party tonight, didn't I? Here, Hans. Hold Yacki. And don't squeeze her. Stop staring. You haven't changed a bit. Always staring at things. Come on. I guess you thought I was still a barmaid, huh? I suppose he told you I used to serve in a bar? Well, I did. Ten years ago when Hans left. It was a large bar, wasn't it Hans. Five girls and a mixer. They always cheated over the drinks. So I took the job to oblige the proprietor. I was sort-of a manager and .. I've lost Yacki. Where is Yacki? No. Here she is, mama. Here. Precious, come to mother. Pet. Did mother forget her little baby? Come on. This is your room. Oh .. mama. Oh. Why, this is much too grand for us. Isn't it, darling? - Hmm. Nothing is too grand for you, Lammchen. Aren't you glad we came to Berlin now? And was there ever anything more beautiful than this bed? It is quite genuine too. It is Louis 16th or Rococo. I don't remember which. You must ask .. Jachman. He gave it to me. - Who is Jachman? Yacki's papa. And a lovely man, Hans. He lives here. Have you married again, mama? No. Look. He is shocked. Hans. You haven't changed a bit. If you think I'm too wicked why do you come here? It wasn't my idea, mama. Lammchen wrote the letter of her own accord. Don't you believe it, mama. He was so pleased with your letter and .. So happy about the job at M?ndels. M?ndels? What job? Well. Mama. Didn't you say in your letter you had a job at M?ndels for me? Did I say M?ndels? I forgot. Anyway, you will have to talk to Jachman about it. He knows everything. I see. Darling, don't look so glum about it. If mama promised you a job you will get it. I love the room, mama. I am sure we'll be very happy here. You should be. I used to get two hundred a month for it. For you and Hans it will only be one hundred. A hundred marks a month? Why, mama. I can't possibly pay that much. I will throw in the telephone. I don't want a telephone, mama. I don't want a grand room like this. Or a bed like that. I don't even know if I've got a job yet, mama. Very well. Stop yelling, Hans. Jachman will attend to it. In the meantime this is your room. Will you help me to get a few things ready? My cleansing woman catches influenza just when I need her most. I would be glad to help, mama. And so will Hans. Won't you, darling? So. He kisses your hand, huh? Well. After you have had them in dishwater for a year or so .. He'll find your lips more preferable. Jachman will attend to it. Herr Jachman. Jachman. Jachman. I didn't know it was I you were calling. Aren't you, Jachman? I am sorry. I am not. - What is your name? Krantz. Hermann Krantz. Have you any identifications? Maybe yes. Most likely no. Why is that of interest to you? I don't know you, do I? I hope I have some. There it is. I have my bank book. - No, no. My mistake. Only you resemble the description a great deal. I look like a thug or a murderer or something? No. I am sorry I troubled you, Herr .. Krantz. - Oh yes. Krantz. No thank you. That's perfectly alright. Hello. Whom have we here? Charming Jachman. Why do you stand and stare? I told you that my son and daughter-in-law were coming today. You never told me a word about, Pinneberg. You never even told me you had a son. And now .. A daughter-in-law. Gracious lady, I am charmed. Tell me. Will you always be here? Washing? Allow me. Well, young man. Even though you are a surprise you are welcome here. With your beautiful wife. Jachman. Stop flirting. Hans would like to hear something about his job. His job? Did you not say that through your influence he had a job at M?ndels? Starting October 1st. Which is tomorrow. Did I say that? Now, how could I say I had fixed a job for your son .. When I didn't even know you had a son. Permit me. Now look at you, Hans. As stupid as ever. You will pay me for it. At least a mark. Yes, mama. I will pay you for it. And for that one too. And that one. And that one. Darling! Why did you say I never told you about my son? Maybe I forgot. Have you forgotten the Stokersons will bring three rich Dutchmen this evening? No. That you were to invite Nina, Clare and Etta? Yes. Have you also forgotten that you were to bring new Ecarte cards with you? I haven't forgotten the cards. - Then get them and put the tables up. And you. Finish the dishes. Come Yacki. Come along Yacki. Yacki. Yacki. Say, Jachman. You can get my husband a job, can't you? I know you must have influence. So? You can tell that by looking at me? Yes. You are much cleverer than we are. I can tell that too. Herr Lehmann, the head of personnel at M?ndels is one of my very best friends. We shall be very unhappy until my husband has some work to do. You'll do all you can for us? I most assuredly will, beautiful lady. We will fix you up in a nice little place somewhere in the west end. Something really unique. And. Out of the way. And I will establish you. Young woman. I will establish you. Firmly. Oh. All we want is a .. A job, Herr Jachman. And if you can get it for us, we all three will be grateful. Three? Yes. My husband, my baby and I. Baby? - Yes. We expect a boy, Herr Jachman. Does Mia Pinneberg know about this? No. I think not. Don't tell her. Take my word for it lovely lady and .. Don't tell her. Good morning. - What is it you want? I thought .. Herr Jachman said .. I'm not concerned with Herr Jachman. What is it you want? I am applying for the position of salesman. At times like these? Well, show me your references. Yes. My school record. Employment insurance. Wage tax. Sorry. This is the card of my last employer. Herr Kleinholz. We don't deal in corn and potatoes. I thought that .. - Nor fertiliser. We are not taking on any new employees just now. In fact, we're laying off the old ones. - Herr Lehmann. You are comfortable. Rich and important. I am poor. I need work. You resent my position? - No. No. I merely ask consideration for mine. I don't want to walk the streets, Herr Lehmann. Many walk the streets these days. Yes. I know. I'm afraid of the streets. Of the streets? Or of yourself? Perhaps myself, Herr Lehmann. Hmm. Report in Fr?ulein Zimmer's office outside. And sign the contract and house regulations. Fr?ulein Zimmer will tell you what to do. Thank you. - That's all. Can we find a place to sleep now? I am so tired. Maybe we'll meet a friend who will give us lodging. Who? What difference, who? As long as he is of our belief and lets us share his household. Wouldn't it be better to find work? Am I not doing a great work now? Yes. Of course. But aren't you hungry? I am. Look. We starve and she gives bread to pigeons. Is it wrong to feed them in the park? While human beings starve? Yes. Oh. You mean you haven't eaten anything today? Nor yesterday. Not even breadcrumbs. And my stomach is bigger than a pigeon's. My wife too needs food. She needs it far more than I do. I have only one left of my husband's lunch. But he is working and I'm sure he would want your wife to have it. I could say you were kind. If I didn't know you would do as much for pigeons. Have you waited long, Lammchen? - It seemed long. How is your first day going? - Not so good. No? I don't know seem to know how to sell. But Heilbutt says I'll soon get the run of it. Heilbutt? - Hmm. A great salesman, they say. He invited me to lunch but I told him I was having it with you. And I'm hungry. What did you bring? Salmon? Yes. But .. - But what? Let's eat. Well, we can't now. - Didn't you make sandwiches for me? Yes. Three sandwiches. - Three? But I gave them away. I fed one to the pigeons. I didn't mean to but they swarmed around me, darling. They seemed so pathetic I just couldn't help feeding them. And the others I gave to a poor man and his wife. If I hadn't fed the pigeons I wouldn't have helped them. But they seemed so poor and .. It's alright, Lammchen. I can buy sandwiches. I am working now. You know. That is one of the reasons I wanted to come here. It makes me feel so superior when I see all these others sitting around. Still. Without my job I would be right with them. But I would be with you. I know. And that makes me always richer. Come on. Let's walk. To a restaurant? - No. I'll get cigarettes instead today. Come on. I would love a dressing table like that. Should I buy it for you on payday? Don't be silly. 130 marks? Of course not. No. Of course not, Lammchen. But if we ever can buy anything like that I shall die of joy. The people who can buy anything like that don't usually die of joy. Kessler. Pinneberg. Sign there. I'll spend that much tonight. Thank you. I think there has been some mistake. This says 150 marks. That is correct. - I expected 250. Move on. You are holding up the others. I am sorry. Heilbutt. Is something wrong? Perhaps not. Only, I had hoped for more money. Don't worry. You will make more in time. You are a born salesman. Now you are being kind. If it weren't for you I wouldn't have any sales to my credit. If I were an employer I would hire you. At more than 150 more? At twice that, because when you find yourself you will be valuable. Then please tell me where to look for myself to hurry on your opinion of me. Just wait, Pinneberg. The world can't change in a day. Yes it can. It changed one day back in 1914. There has been blood in the air ever since. Pinneberg. Are you a pacifist? I haven't any theories, but .. Next to my wife I love peace. I think that the people that want it are entitled to it. I like you very much. I like you too, Herr Heilbutt. Would you come my house one evening and meet my wife? Indeed I will. Where do you live? - Stenstrasse, 92. Second floor. I'll walk home with you now. - I am not going directly home now. I have an errand to do first. I hope you become an employer soon, Herr Heilbutt. That may not be so remote. You too may be an employer one day. No, no. I wouldn't even know what to tell myself to do. Well. Pinneberg. So this is what kept you so late, eh? It was too late for delivery so I hired an express one myself. I wanted Lammchen to have it tonight. Do you like it, dear? - I don't. No? Why not? No, charming lady. I do not like the mirror. It is hardship enough to resist one view of your little face. But three? That's too much. Now, isn't she nice, Jachman? What difference does poverty make? Let them talk on the streets. Let them say what they like. They can't stop me from standing here and looking at my wife. In three mirrors too. I want to see you. Come in. No. I would rather talk to you alone. New furniture? Yes. Do you like it, Mama? - No. But I'm glad to see you are flush today. You get dressed. It's almost 8 o'clock. - I know. Are you forgetting we're having a party? - No, Mia. Hans. - Hmm. Come to my room. - In a minute, mama. Now, Hans. She just wants the rent, darling. - Yes, I know. Dear. She didn't like my dressing table, did she. Well, you mustn't blame Frau Pinneberg for not being over-fond of mirrors .. Sweet darling. [ Loud party noises ] Parties. Parties. How can mama stand them? Was that Herr Jachman kissing that girl? I neither know nor care. It was sweet of you to buy the dressing table for me. But you shouldn't have done it. Not yet. Did you pay mama the rent? I didn't have enough. Darling, why not? How much is your salary? One hundred and fifty. And yet you paid one hundred and thirty for ..? Oh, darling. How are we going to live? We've got to save. Don't you understand that? Lammchen, dear. I know I have been a fool and should not have done it but .. But that is the way I am. And that is why you must help me. Look. [ Loud party noises ] Phew. No wonder mama is in such an ugly mood. Will she come in again, do you think? What kind of advertising does mama put in the paper? Advertising? What? Today I answered the phone. Someone started talking about advertising and mama took the receiver. Maybe she is going to rent our room? - No. Not without telling us. Besides .. She is lucky to have us here at a hundred marks a month. Far too much for this room. Even when she doesn't get it? Oh. Lammchen, why do you pick on me? Isn't it enough that I've got mama worrying me without you helping her? Anyway, I don't like her. I don't like her parties and I don't like her. Here she comes. We are asleep, mama. Are you really asleep? No, Herr Jachman. Please go. Sweet lady, may I stay a moment? Turn on the light so I can see the three beautiful ladies. Because now. There might be six. You've been drinking I know, Herr Jachman. But please get out. Why should I go? When I just came in .. To help you. And to sit .. At the beautiful lady's feet. Those are my feet. My mistake. I'm not going to ask you again, Herr Jachman. To get out. - That's right. Don't. Because I wish to speak to you about the rent. You too? Is that you, sweet lady? Where are you? Turn on the light so I can see you. - What about the rent, Herr Jachman? Is your mother angry. She has been crying and cursing all evening. So I said to myself, Jachman. I call myself Jachman. Come, come. Why don't you do something for poor Hans? I know you can't pay it because you bought the mirror. And I am glad you got the mirror because .. When the beautiful lady looks in the mirror there are three beautiful ladies. One for you. And two for me. So I figure that I'll organise .. Why shouldn't I give some of my money to the children instead of to the old lady? They will give it to her. And it makes everything beautiful. You are sweet, Herr Jachman. Yes. Really kind. But I cannot accept your money. No? And you, dear lady? No, Herr Jachman. But we do appreciate it. Jachman. - Shush. Shush. Don't give me away. She mustn't find me here. Jachman. Jachman? Is Jachman in here? No, mama. He might have sneaked in without you seeing him. He is such a fool when he is drinking. Bless my soul. Two hundred marks. Is it for me? Well .. Yes, mama. We started to give it to you tonight. That is rent for two months. You sweet Hans. Well, what is going on in here? Get out. Get out please. Get out. This is my children's room. Herr Jachman. She has gone. Herr Jachman. Herr Jachman. [ Snoring ] Poor Jachman. We'll let him sleep for a while. We are not satisfied with the results of this department. One or two of you exceeded your quota. A few reached it. Others are far behind it. Today, we are inaugurating a new sales plan. You shall receive a percentage. Equal to your present salaries. Providing your sales have reached the amount of your quota. If you exceed it. Your percentage will be an additional salary. If you fall below it. We will replace you with men capable of reaching it. Why do you scowl, Herr Heilbutt? As our head salesman, you should approve the plan. If I've been successful it's because I enjoy my work. Threats certainly won't encourage me. If I may so Herr Spannfuss, you are using the wrong methods. In trying to scare your salesmen you only confuse them. Have you a better plan? If economy is your purpose I suggest you can abolish all salaries over 400 marks. Thank you, Herr Heilbutt. That will be all. Your quota system creates competition between your salesmen. It sacrifices their goodwill toward each other and ultimately toward you. That is all. It's disgraceful that M?ndels puts the burden of overheads on their employees. And make his job dependent on the business done by your store. We don't share your profits so why must we take your risks? Herr Heilbutt. It's your duty to get the customers in. We will then sell to them. I don't like your attitude, Herr Heilbutt. But I shall bring your suggestions, as well as your actions .. To the attention of the board of directors. I am quite sure they will act promptly on both. In the meantime, Herr Spannfuss, you may accept my resignation. That will be all, gentlemen. You are not really leaving? - Yes. At once. Aren't you being foolish? - No. Independent. Perhaps being a nudist does that for me. Standing out in the sun gives one strength and courage, Pinneberg. But don't worry. Here's my address. You'll always find me there if you need me. I shall need you, Herr Heilbutt. I need you now, to hold on to my job. Pinneberg. - Yes? You live in the Stenstrasse don't you? Yes. 92? Second floor? Yes. How did you know? Well, everybody knows. Are you married? Yes. Any children? What is all this to you? Oh, nothing. Only marriage isn't an easy job nowadays. Yet this percentage business shouldn't bother you, with such a sideline. A sideline? Discrete introductions of lonely men to lovely women. What are you driving at? What do you mean? What do I mean? - Yes. Suppose I told Herr Spannfuss you let your wife advertise in the papers? What do you mean? Don't be a fool, Pinneberg. It will cost you your job. Come on, pal. What's this advertisement you are talking about? I'm sure it doesn't concern Pinneberg. Let's see it. I will gladly read it to all of you. 'Are you unhappy'? 'I can introduce you to a charming circle of ladies'. 'Frau Pinneberg. Stenstrasse, 92. Second floor'. That is not my wife. No. That is my mother. My stepmother. She has parties and they play cards but that's all I thought it was. Just playing cards. Just parties. But I didn't know all. Ah, breakfast. Mia Pinneberg, what a grand idea. Two cups of coffee and we can start all over again. Don't be a fool. That is my daughter-in-law. Is breakfast ready yet? Almost, mama. Hans. What are you doing back so soon? Where is Lammchen? - In the kitchen. Look, Hans. We are having .. But if I'm smart enough to fall asleep in your room, dear lady. Why didn't I wake up and find myself in my own bed? Hans put you there. Come on. Darling. Has anything happened to your job? - No, Lammchen. Just come. We have to get out of here. Alright, dear. As soon as I take in their breakfast. Your breakfast. We're ravenous. Come on, Hans. Pass it around. Pass it around. Here is your food. Eat it .. eat it! Why, you young pup .. Hans. Come on, Lammchen. Let's get out of here. Permit me, darling lady. Oh, I .. I am sorry about the breakfast. You don't expect me to haul this stuff around until you find a place. No. I am afraid that would be too expensive. I hadn't expected so much trouble. I am not thinking of the expense. I'm thinking of the horse. She is a pretty old mare. Why can't you find a place? Because they either want too much money or they don't want children. Have you got any children? No. Then, what are you talking about? I expect a baby. Yes? Is that so? It takes a lot of courage, young woman. I know. I took care of Frieda here. Every time she had a cold. Five. She is a good breeder. You look alright too. What kind of place do you want? A cheap place. Would you climb a ladder to get to it? I would do even more. I would jump up one. Over my furniture shop I have got a place. A room? A bedroom and a bed and .. And a stove there too. I could let you have it for .. For thirty marks a month. Really? - Yes. Providing you take your baby crib from me. I got an old one which I can .. Rebuild and paint fresh. I could let you have it for .. Fifteen marks. If you buy it I will reduce the rent .. To twenty marks a month. Being a landlord .. Is just a sideline. Furniture is my business. Is it a deal? - Oh yes. Providing .. You let me give you twenty marks for the baby crib. And fifteen marks a month for the rent. Is that a deal? Yes, sir. I like that even better. But I tell you something, young lady. I am making a lot of profit on that baby crib. Be careful, Lammchen. Why you rented a place like this I don't know. Now don't go until you have seen it. Here. On your left we have a stove. Not big enough to cook much on but we can't afford much, so big enough. Now, on your right according to Herr Puttbreese, is a Napoleon bed. If you look at it closely you will see why Napoleon slept so often in a chair. Now. This, according to Herr Puttbreese is the gateway to heaven. You can see directly to the stars. Roof garden and orchestra. And all for fifteen marks a month. Isn't that cheap, darling? I think it is horrible, Lammchen. It is like a stable room. A pig pen. And I mean it. I hate it. [ Music playing ] Do you remember that music, dear? No. Not particularly. You should. Why? Because that is the waltz we could hear them playing in the pavilion. That night when we were on the beach together. The first night. Darling, if I should die have that played for me again. Lammchen, why do you speak of death? Do you still love me? - I do. I do. That is why I'm beginning to hate the whole world. Because you love me? Yes. What have we done to life that we should be so mistreated? We met, we loved, we married. We're going to have a child. That is paying the full price for the privilege of living. And for that we can stand out here and listen to that music .. As it plays for someone else to dance to and say how wonderful it all is. But it isn't wonderful. It isn't. It is rotten. It is unfair. - Darling. You are talking just like the man in the street. Yes. Yes. I am. And this morning I found a knife in my hand. Lammchen. Take care of me. Please. What were his totals last month? - My percentage amounted to 45 marks. Yes. And the month before it was 61. And but one sale so far for this month. Herr Pinneberg, I suggest you raise your totals immediately and avoid dismissal. That is all. Had trouble, Herr Pinneberg? A little. Schluter, the screen actor. Why not let him take his choice? Alright. Good afternoon, young man. And may I ask, are you the possessor of a lively fancy? Oh? Fancy clothes are on the second floor. No. That's not what I mean. What I really meant was .. For example. Look at that sack of trousers. Could you imagine a goldfish perched there? Singing? Not very well, sir. Have you ever heard a goldfish sing? No, sir. - It is well. If ever you do, begin to worry. How can I serve you? Why should one man serve another? Yet after all it is the custom, isn't it? Yes. Now supposing a young man were to come in from, let us say .. The wrong side of the town. And being flush should want a complete outfit. Could you tell me the sort of things he would be likely to choose? You mean .. more than one suit? Perhaps a dozen. - Oh. But before you show me these things. I want you to get this picture firmly fixed in your mind. When the young man comes in through that door. This .. is what he will look like. Oh. That is wonderful, Herr Schluter. You know me then? - Yes. I have seen you on the screen. - Ah. What was the picture? Uh .. I can't recall the name. But you were a cashier in a bank. And you stole money. - Ah .. I remember. My wife was ill. And my child was dying. Tell me, which part of the picture did you like best? Where you stole the money. I liked the expression on your face. When you put the bundles of notes into a satchel. Ah. Like this you mean? Yes. Just like that. It seemed so real. You seemed to need it so badly. Don't laugh. It was .. I felt as if I were doing it myself. The voice of the people. I am honored. Now, show me .. Show the young man from the wrong side of the town your suits. Yes, sir. Well, he has shown him everything in the store. Excellent, young man. All your things are excellent. What do I put on your account, Herr Schluter? Account? Ha. My dear young fellow. I am not buying any of these things. You see. In my next picture. I play a young man from the wrong side of town. And I wanted to get a few Ideas. Oh. For heaven's sake don't look so upset about it. I'll send you a card for my next first night. You are married? I will send you two cards. - Herr Schluter. Please. Buy something. You have so much money. If you go away now they'll think it's my fault and I'll be dismissed. Don't be absurd. I can't buy all these things just to please you. I'm like the bank clerk you played on the screen, Herr Schluter. My wife too. She is ill and we expect a child. But my good fellow. Those are your affairs. Not mine. - Then do it for my sake. I have been serving you for two hours. I have shown you everything I can think of. At least buy one suit. This one. It is pure Cheviot. It will wear forever. - For ever? Can you imagine me living in a thing like that .. forever? And besides. I am getting tired. Please, Herr Schluter. There is a quota fixed for us by the firm. And unless we make it we are dismissed. I am behind many marks. Please. Please buy something. Take your hands off me. If you please. My name is Lehmann. I am the general manager. I am Franz Schluter. The actor. You have very odd assistants here. They assault your customers to make them buy. This young man says he is forced to meet his quota. Blackmail, don't you think? Herr Pinneberg. Against the wishes of Herr Spannfuss I gave you another chance. But now you are dismissed. Go at once to the personnel department and get your papers. What he told you about the quota is quite false. Why, only a little while ago I told him .. If he couldn't reach it not to even worry. Tell me, Herr Schluter. What is your next picture? He is going to play a poor young man. Hmm. A poor young man from the wrong side of town. [ Door knocks ] Alright, Herr Jachman. I am dressed. Dear lady. You are beautiful. You are charming. You are magnificent. Will Hans like it, do you think? Sweet child, is your husband blind? How could he look at you and not like it? But he might not like the idea of you giving me dresses and flowers and candy. Well, is it my fault if the police turn up at Mia Pinneberg's .. While Etta and Gretchen are doing .. In their .. Sweet darling. Nothing less. And the poor girls were dragged out. While I .. Absent-mindedly slip through the side window with their dresses and wraps. Figuring one of them .. might fit you. And it does. But Herr, Jachman. This dress has never been worn. It is new. New. Oh .. wear it just for tonight. I loan it to you. In fact, it was I who gave it to Etta. But we won't mention that. Mia Pinneberg might not like it. Herr Jachman, you are such an awful liar. And you are such a lovely woman. Maybe I had better wait here. I'll surprise him first. Your turn comes next. Come, come. Quick. Jachman. Hello Hans. How are you? Where is Lammchen? Lammchen? I don't know. You're as pale as a ghost. Is something wrong? Yes. I've been discharged. I've lost my job. Where is Lammchen? Young man, behold the gracious Queen. Her Majesty is extremely happy tonight. And in no mood for affairs of state. Do you like me? You look beautiful, Lammchen. You may kiss my hand. And now we will escort Her Majesty to some popular caf?. Where she may enjoy good food .. Old wine and excellent music. Not tonight, Jachman. Yes, dear. Please tonight. Herr Jachman wants us to go. - We haven't any money, Lammchen. I don't want to go anywhere tonight. My dear fellow. Jachman's guest. Needs no money. Won't you go? Herr Jachman has brought this beautiful dress just for me to wear tonight. It may be my last chance to go out and I do so want to go. Hans looks tired, doesn't he. A little. - Hmm. He is working so hard. He isn't making much money yet, but he soon will be as he gets more experience. You love Hans, don't you. Oh .. yes. You could never love my kind of man, could you? I am not your kind of a woman. Let's sit down. More wine please waiter. Has it been wonderful, darling? - Oh yes. Quite wonderful. But it must be very expensive, Herr Jachman. Herr Krantz? Krantz? - Jachman. I would like to see you for a moment. Pardon, Hans. Do you mind? - Not if you don't stay too long. It will seem long, sweet lady. If it's only a moment. Do you always sing on your way to jail, Jachman? No. Only when I am happy. You are going to get five years. Do you realize that? Yes. Sure. Do you believe in Santa Claus? Do I look silly? I was Santa Claus tonight. You? Yes. I. Dissipated old Jachman. Brought a bagful of happiness. To an angel. That is why I can sing .. Bring us some more wine please. Where do you suppose Jachman has gone? He will be back, dear. - But it is an hour now. 90 marks. What do we do? I had better speak to the management. We can't just go on ordering. Will they mind very much, do you think? No. They may just put us in jail. That is all. Herr Pinneberg? Yes, sir? This envelope just came for you by messenger. 150 marks. 'Hans. Please pardon my bad manners'. 'And drink another bottle of wine to her Majesty the Queen for me. Jachman'. Another bottle of wine, waiter. Please. He says to drink this to you, Lammchen. No. To Jachman. This is not for you, Frieda. You are jealous. Jealous of Frau Pinneberg. You don't think anybody but you has the right to have children. Onion soup. Smells good, Herr Puttbreese. Smells good? It is good. You have been so kind. I don't know how we'll ever repay you. Don't you bother about it. But I do. I worry about the rent too. We owe you five months now. Your husband is still out of work, isn't he? He tries so hard. He goes out early every morning. Here. Have some of this while it's hot. I bet you were a wonderful husband, Herr Puttbreese. Yes. I would have been. If I ever had a wife. That is the best onion soup I ever tasted. Weren't you ever in love? Sure. I have probably been refused by more women than any ten men living. Well, they were silly. - Sure. That is what I figured. I guess there isn't much sex appeal in just being able to cook. Even when I was in the army. As soon as the girls found out I was a chef .. Then I found it didn't do me a bit of good. You like my dressing table, don't you. A nice piece of furniture. - Hmm. I said you can have it on account for the rent. Yes, I know. But .. I don't like trading rent for things. Furniture is my business. I tell you what I will do. I will swap you a sofa. A Morris chair. And a 3-drawer chest of drawers. Is it a deal? I don't need a Morris chair and a chest of drawers. But I will tell you what. Hans is stopping by the insurance office today. To see about the warranty money. And if he doesn't get it. I'll sell it to you for enough to go to the hospital. I should be there now, you know. How much did you pay for it? One hundred and thirty marks. Of course it's second-hand now, but .. It should be worth .. Seventy. Yes. Maybe. Sure. Maybe even seventy-five. I tell you what I will do. I will give you eighty for it. And throw in the sofa and the chest of drawers. Is it a deal? Yes. If you take out part of the money for the rent. No, no. I don't want to mix up my furniture business with my renting. And besides, I am pretty smart. The reason why I am giving you the sofa and the chest of drawers .. Is just to have some security for the rent. So you don't want any more soup? Not now, thank you. Alright. I'll put some fire under it. To keep it warm for you. I will be seeing you later. Goodbye for a while. Goodbye, Herr Puttbreese. Herr Puttbreese. Come back will you please. Herr Puttbreese! I am Johannes Pinneberg. Number 6-6-6-8-6-7. Again? Yes. We haven't received that commitment yet. When was the child born? I'm waiting for the money to send my wife to the hospital. Have you your membership card? Yes. You have asked me that every day for a week now. And the birth certificate? I can scarcely have a birth certificate until my baby is born. Exactly what do you want? Regulations call for a birth certificate before the confinement check is issued. Yesterday you told me the check was mailed. Have you sent us your claim in writing? - Yes. Yes. Over two weeks ago when you told me to. Just a moment. Your claim has been dealt with by mail. When? - Yesterday. The money wasn't there this morning. - Well, I can't help that. Well, you've got to help it. I am entitled to it. Look here. If I don't find that money at home I'll be back. Will you please look that up? - Yes. Is Herr Heilbutt in? Weren't you here before? - Yes. Herr Heilbutt wasn't in. - I told you then. Herr Heilbutt had moved. And left no address. I remember, but I thought maybe he had come back. No. Herr Heilbutt has left Germany. Left Germany? - Yes. For Holland. He has relatives in Amsterdam. So he has left Germany? I didn't know him very long. I liked him very much. Has he left for good? For good or bad .. He has gone. Coming, comrade? Where? - The meeting. There's a message in it for you. A message from a great leader. Will they show me where to find the money to take my wife to the hospital? He will show why you shouldn't need any money to send your wife to the hospital. Come on. Oh. Where is your wife? They killed her. Who? They. They. The ones we are against. She is dead. She died in these arms. It would have been better for her .. If she had waited to see Dr Sesam. Is that you, Pinneberg? What are you doing here? Why aren't you in the house? What is the matter with you? I can't go in. I can never look Lammchen in the face again. The police. They shoved me off the sidewalk. Knocked me down into the gutter. I am so ashamed. You are not ashamed of your .. Baby, are you? It's here. I got the doctor for her. Nothing new to me. I've been through it five times with Frieda. A boy? Of course, a boy. Poor little fellow. What now? Lammchen. I have been a horrible failure and .. I don't know where to begin again. But I am going to take care of our son. I hoped .. I hoped you would say it like that, dear. Look at him. Isn't he small and helpless? Life can't be any bigger than he is. Because he is life, isn't he. And we created him. Didn't we? We created life. So why should we be afraid of it? Soon his tiny little voice will drown out all the voices in the streets. And instead of just me clinging to you. You will have both of us. You will always have to let us share with you. Even if it is only poverty. Herr Pinneberg. Herr Pinneberg. Heilbutt. Shall I come up? - Yes. You said you wanted me to meet your wife so here I am. Yes, yes. Heilbutt, come on up. You've waited so long, now you'll meet my baby. Baby? Yes. The prettiest baby in the world. He is like you, Heilbutt. He is a nudist. Where have you been? They told me you had left for good. - Yes. For very good. I am an employer now. Yes, Pinneberg. In Amsterdam. - No, Heilbutt. Yes, Pinneberg. And I have come to hire you. No, Heilbutt. Yes. And maybe your son. No, Heilbutt. ..wg..
