But I looked at that house and I started to cry because I was just blown away "Why you crying?" "Honey, I finally understand how the Law of Attraction works. I finally understand the power of visualisation. I finally understand everything that I've read, everything that I've worked with. My whole life, the way I've built companies. It worked for my home as well, and I bought our dream home and didn't even know it." Decide what you want, believe you can have it, believe you deserve it, and believe it' s possible for you. And then close your eyes every day for several minutes and visualize having what you already want, and feeling the feelings of already having it. Come out of that and focus on what you're grateful for already. And really be, enjoy it, okay And then go into your day and release it to the Universe, and trust that the Universe will figure out how to manifest. You know, the Secret was definitely a real transformation for me, because I grew up in a family where my dad was very negative, thought that rich people were people that had ripped everyone off Thought that anyone that had money must have deceived somebody. So I grew up with a lot of beliefs about money that if you had it, it made you bad, you know, only evil people have money and you know, money doesn't grow on trees. That was a big one. "Who do you think I am, Rockefeller?" That was one of his favourite phrases. So I grew up truly believing that life was difficult, that it was hard, you had to struggle. And it was only when I met W. Clement Stone, that I literally began to shift my life. When I was working with Stone he said, "I want you to set a goal that' s so big that if you achieved it, it would blow your mind. And you would know it' s only because of what I've taught you that you would have achieved this goal." Well, at the time I was making about eight thousand dollars a year and for some reason I wanted something that was really measurable, so I said, "I want to make a hundred thousand dollars in a year." I had no idea how I could do that. I saw no strategy, no possibility but I just said, "I'm going to declare that, I'm going to believe it, I'm going to act as if it' s true, and release it." And so I did that. And one of the things he taught me was every day to close your eyes and visualize the goals as if it's already achieved. And I had actually made a hundred thousand dollar bill that I'd put on the ceiling. So the first thing I'd see when I woke up... I'd look up and there it was and it would remind me that this was my intention. And then I would close my eyes and visualize having this hundred thousand dollar a year lifestyle. And interestingly enough, nothing major happened for about thirty days. You know, I didn't have any great breakthrough ideas, no-one was offering me more money. And all of a sudden I was in the shower, it was about four weeks into it, and I had a hundred thousand dollar idea. It just came right into my head. I had a book I had written, and I said if I can sell four hundred thousand copies of my book at a quarter each, that'd be a hundred thousand dollars. Now, the book was there, but I?d never had this thought And one of the secrets, I think, is Now I didn't know how to do that, I didn't know how I was going to sell four hundred thousand copies, we'd never done that. And then I saw the National Enquirer at the supermarket. I had seen that millions of times, and it was just background. And all of a sudden it jumped out at me as foreground. And I thought, "Wow, if readers knew about my book, certainly four hundred thousand people would go out and buy it.' And about six weeks later I gave a talk at Hunter College in New York to six hundred teachers, and this lady comes up at the end and she says, - "That was a great talk, I want to interview you. Let me give you my card." And I said, "Who do you write for?" "I'm a freelancer, but I sell most of my stuff to the National Enquirer." You know, and I had this little theme from the Twilight Zone went off in my head. "Dern-ner ner ner..." Like, whoah, this stuff?s really working. So that article came out and our book sales started to take off But the point I want to make is that I was attracting into my life all these different events including this person. And to make a long story short, I did not make a hundred thousand dollars that year. We made ninety-two thousand three hundred and twenty-seven dollars. But you think we were like depressed and going, "This doesn't work"? No, we were going, "Whoa, this is amazing!" And so my wife said to me "Wow, if it works for a hundred thousand, do you think it'd work for a million?" And I said, "I don't know, I think so. Let' s try it." And my publisher actually wrote me a check, it was a royalty check, for our first Chicken Soup for the Soul book. He actually put a smiley face in the signature cause it was the first million dollar check he'd ever written. And so I know from my own experience, because I wanted to test it, does this Secret really work? And we put it to the test. It absolutely worked. And now I live my life from that, every single day. Well, I can just imagine what a lot of people that are watching this are thinking. And that is, how can I attract more money into my life? How can I get more of the green stuff? How can I get more of wealth and prosperity? How can I, when I love my job, deal with the credit card debt that I have and the realization that maybe there?s a ceiling on the money that can come in, "cause it's coming to me through my job? How can I bring in more? Intend it! This goes back to one of the things we've been talking about throughout the whole Secret. Your job is to declare what you would like to have from the catalogue of the universe. Well, if cash is one of them, say how much you would like to have. I would like to have twenty-five thousand dollars, unexpected income, within the next thirty days, or whatever it happens to be. It should be believable for you. Most people have a goal of getting out of debt That?ll keep you in debt forever. Whatever you're thinking about you will attract. You say, but it's get out of debt. I don't care if it' s get out or get in, if you're thinking debt you're attracting debt. Set up an automatic debt repayment program and then start to focus on prosperity. So many times people say to me, "Well I'd like to double my income in the next year". But then you look at their actions and they're not doing the things that are going to make that happen and, you know, they'll turn right around and they'll go, "Well I can't afford that". Ok, guess what, "Your wish is my command". As you are fussing about not having enough money, as you are talking to your friend about not having enough money, as you are feeling unhappy about not having enough money, you are actually activating within yourself, or continuing the activation of a thought, that is very different from the desire that you have launched. What it just comes down to is, you just can't want more money and focus upon not enough. When I first understood The Secret I was getting bills, every day I would get a bunch of bills in the mail. And I thought how do I turn this around? The Law of Attraction states, that what you focus on you will get. So I got a bank statement, I whited-out the total, and I put a new total in there. I put exactly how much I wanted to see in the bank. What if I just visualized checks coming in the mail? So I just visualized, a bunch of checks coming in the mail. Within just one month, things started to change. And it's amazing. Today I just get checks in the mail. I get a few bills, but I get more checks than bills. I grew up on you have to work hard for money, you have to work hard for money. And so I replaced that with, money comes easily and frequently. Now in the beginning it feels like a lie, right. There was a part of your brain that will say, "Oh you liar, it's hard." So, you have to know this little tennis match that will go on for a while. When it comes to creating wealth, wealth is a mindset. It's all about how you think. I'd say 80% of my coaching that I do one on one with folks, is about their psychology and the way they think I know when people are listening they say "Oh, well you can do it, I can't." Every person has the capability to change the way their inner relationship and conversation with money. I find so many people who maybe make a tremendous amount of money, but their relationships stink. That's a technical term, by the way. And that's not wealth, it really isn't. You know, you can go after the money and you might get rich, but it doesn't guarantee you'll be wealthy. I'm not suggesting that money isn't a part of wealth, it absolutely is, but it's only a part. And then I meet a lot of people who are, quote unquote, "spiritual', but they're sick and broke all the time. That's not wealth either. Life is meant to be abundant. In all areas. Many people in Western culture are striving for success, they want to have the home, they want their business to work, they want all of these things. But what I found in my research is that having those things certainly doesn't guarantee what we really want, which is happiness. And that's when all those outer things come. They don't come from going after them first to get happiness. It's backwards. You go for the sense of inner joy, of inner peace, of inner vision, first, and then all the other things from the outside appear. The Secret means for me actually that we are creators of our universe. And that every wish of what we want to create will manifest in our lives. Therefore it's very important what you wish, what your thoughts are, what your feelings are, because it will manifest. Now, one day I went into somebody' s home and he was an art director, a very famous film producer. And in every corner he had this beautiful image of a woman, a naked woman, dressed with a fabric, kind of doing this, kind of saying "I don't look at you, I don't see you", you know And I said, "I think you have trouble in your romance." "Are you clairvoyant or something?" "No, but look. Seven places, you have exactly that woman." "But I love that kind of painting. I painted it myself." "That's even worse," I said, "because you put all your creation and creativity in it." Now he's this gorgeous looking man, he has all these actresses around him, because that' s the work he does, and he doesn't get romance. I said, "What do you want?" "Well, I want to date three women a week." "Okay, paint yourself with three women, and hang it in every corner." Six months later I see him in Europe, and I said, "How is your love life?" "Great! They just call me, they want to date me." "Because that' s your wish." "Now I have like three dates a week. They're fighting over me." "Good on you." "But I really want to stabilize a little bit. I want marriage, I want romance." "Well, paint it, okay." So he painted a beautiful romantic relationship, and a year later he got married, and he's very happy. Because he put another wish out. But he wished it in himself for years, but it did not happen because his wish could not manifest because the outer level of himself, his house, was just contradicting himself all the time. So if you know this knowledge, you should start playing with it. Inside relationships, it' s important to first understand who' s coming into the relationship. And I don't mean about your partner, I mean about you. How can you ever expect anyone else to enjoy your company, if you don't enjoy your own company? And so, again, the law of attraction or the Secret, is about bringing that into your life, and you've got to get really, really clear. Here's the question I would to ask you to consider; do you treat yourself the way you want other people to treat you? You become the solution for you. Don't like, "Now you owe me and you need to give me more'. Instead, give more to yourself. Take time off to give to yourself, in a sense to fill yourself up to fullness, to where now you can overflow in giving. I got into many relationships expecting my partner to show me my beauty. I needed to see him showing me my beauty, because I didn't feel beautiful. Because when I was growing up my she-roes were Charlie' s angels, or the Bionic Woman, Wonder Woman. And though they were wonderful women, none of them looked like me. It wasn't until I stopped, and I fell in love with Lisa - full lips, round hips, mocha skin, afro- that the rest of the world began to fall in love with Lisa. There's something so magnificent about you. I have been studying me for 44 years, mwa! I wanna kiss myself! Because you're gonna get to love yourself. I'm not talking about conceit. I'm talking about a healthy respect for yourself. And as you love yourself, you'll love others. Sometimes people will say, "Those people at work are so negative," or "The man that I live with is so angry," or "My children are so worrisome to me," and we say, you must orient yourself to the best part of those people who surround you. We encourage that you get a notebook and you make a list of the positive aspects of the people that you spend a lot of time with. There could be someone that you have a terrible experience with, a terrible relationship with, and in the privacy of your own mind, and with quite a bit of work we will admit, as you focus upon the things that you like most, those people will become that, mostly, to you. And even though you can not create in their reality, If they are in a mood or an attitude that doesn't match the mood or attitude that you have about them, they'll zig while you zag. Law of attraction will not put you in the same space together. Your frequencies don't match up. If you knew your potential to feel good, you would ask no one to be different so that you can feel good. You would free yourself of all of that cumbersome impossibility of needing to control the world, or control your mate, or control your child. For no-one else can think for you. No one else can do it. It is only you. Every bit of it you. It's important to recognize that our body is really the product of our thoughts. We're beginning to understand in medical science the degree to which the nature of thoughts and emotions actually determines the physical substance and structure and function of our bodies. We've known in the healing arts, of a placebo affect. A placebo is something that supposedly has no impact and no effect on the body, like a sugar pill or something. You tell the patient that this is just as effective, and what happens is the placebo has the same effect if not greater effect, than sometimes the medication that is supposed to be designed for that effect. So they found out that the human mind is the biggest factor in the healing arts. More so than sometimes the medication. If somebody is in a situation where they're sick, and they have an alternative to try to explore what is in their mind creating it, versus using medicine, if it's an acute situation that could really bring death to them, then obviously the medicine is a wise thing to do, while they explore what the mind is about. So you don't want to negate medicine. Every form of healing has a place. There is only a stream of well being that flows, you know. It is a stream of pure positive energy. And the Universe, all that we know, is abundant with only that. This is a world that is based upon wellbeing and wellbeing dramatically abounds. And when you are allowing that stream to flow, in its fullness, you feel very, very good. And when you are pinching it off a bit, you feel not so good. There is only a stream of goodness or wellbeing which you are allowing or not. And your magnificent emotions are telling you what the mix is. How you're doing in your allowing or your resisting of this connection. You know people who have had terminal disease. Stop and think of the word "dis-ease'. Hyphenate the word. That's a body that' s not at ease. We've got a thousand different diagnosis and disease out there. They're just the weak link. They're all the result of one thing. Stress. And you put enough stress on the chain and you put enough stress on the system and one of the links breaks. Our physiology creates disease to give us feedback, to let us know we have an imbalanced perspective and we're not loving, and we're not grateful. So the body signs and symptoms Are not something terrible. The question is frequently asked is when a person has manifested a disease in the body temple, or some kind of discomfort in their life, through the power of right thinking can it be turned around? And the answer is absolutely yes. On November 23rd I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I truly believed in my heart, with my strong faith, that I was already healed. During the day, all day long, I would just say, "Thank you for my healing." On and on and on I went. "Thank you for my healing." I believed in my heart I was healed. I saw myself as if cancer was never in my body. One of the things I did to heal myself was to watch very funny movies. That's all we would do is just laugh, laugh, laugh. We couldn't afford to put any stress in my life, because we knew stress was one of the worst things you can do while you're trying to heal yourself. From the time I was diagnosed, which was November 23rd, to the time I was healed, totally was approximately three months. And that's without radiation or chemotherapy. We come with a basic program. It's called self-healing. You get a wound, it grows back together. You get a bacterial infection, the immune system comes and takes care of those bacteria and heals it up. The immune system is made to heal itself. Disease cannot live in a body that' s in a healthy emotional state. Your body is casting off millions of cells every second, and it's creating millions of new cells. In fact literally, parts of our body are replaced every day. Other parts take a few months, other parts a couple of years. But within a few years we have a brand new physical body. If you have a dis-ease, and you're focusing on it and you're talking to people about it, you're going to create more dis-eased cells. See yourself living in a perfectly healthy body. Let the doctor look after the dis-ease. Can you feel the difference between having painful arthritis in your hips and feeling fearful about it, or having painful arthritis in your hips and feeling hopeful about it? The difference between fearful and hopeful, is the difference between recovery or not. Happier thoughts lead to essentially a happier biochemistry. A happier, healthier body. Negative thoughts, stress, have been shown to seriously degrade the body and the functioning of the brain, because it' s our thoughts and emotions that are continuously reassembling, reorganising, recreating, our body. Remove physiological stress from the body, and the body does what it was designed to do. It heals itself. I've seen kidneys regenerated, I've seen cancer dissolved, I've seen eyesight improve and come back. I always say that incurable means curable from within. You can change your life and you can heal yourself. Well, my story begins on March the 10th 1981. It really changed my whole life. It was a day I'll never forget. I crashed an airplane. I ended up in the hospital completely paralysed. My spinal chord was crushed, I broke the first and second cervical vertebrae, my swallowing reflex was destroyed, I couldn't eat or drink, my diaphragm was destroyed, I couldn't breathe. All I could do was blink my eyes. The doctors, of course, said all my life I'd be a vegetable. All I'd do is blink my eyes the rest of my life. That's the picture they saw of me, but it didn't matter what they thought. The main thing was what I thought, I pictured myself being a normal person again, walking out of that hospital. The only thing I had to work with in the hospital was my mind, and once you have your mind, you can put things back together again. I was hooked to a respirator and they said I'd never breathe on my own again because my diaphragm was destroyed. But this little voice kept saying to me, "Breathe deep, breathe deep." And finally I was weaned from it. They were at a loss for an explanation. See I could not afford to allow anything to come into my mind that would distract me from my goal and from my vision. Well I'd set the goal to walk out of the hospital on Christmas. That was my goal. Eight months later I walked out of the hospital on my own two feet. They said it couldn't be done. That's a day I will never forget. For people that are sitting out there right now watching this program, that are hurting if I wanted to sum up my life and sum up for people what they can do in life, I would sum it up this way in six words; "Man becomes what he thinks about.' We notice there are so many people who are living life in a very conditional way. They look out and they see things that are wonderful, and they say, "Yes, we want more of those, we would vote for that, we would support that with our time and energy and money". But then they look out and they see things that they do not want. Terrible things, that they do not want to live. And that they do not want to see others live, and they say, "We've got to do something about getting rid of those things". But they don't realise that as they push against the unwanted, they add power to it. In this world there is a war against poverty, and a war against cancer, and a war against teenage pregnancy, and a war against terrorism, and a war against violence and a war against terrorism. Did we mention that there' s a war against terrorism? And all of this pushing against is only adding to, because you can't say, "no" and make it go away, when you shout, "no!" Law of Attraction is lining that up. The reason that what you resist persists, is because if you're resisting something, you're saying, "no I don't want this thing, because it makes me feel this way, the way I'm feeling right now", so you're just putting out this really strong emotion of, "Wow I really don't like this feeling," and it's there, it just comes racing towards you. You know the anti-war movement creates more war. The anti-drug movement has actually created more drugs. Because we're focussing on what we don't want; drugs. People will say, "Well shouldn't I focus upon that? That is true," and we say, that is like saying, because someone gave their attention to something they did not want, long enough that now it is manifested, I should do it too. And we say, we don't really understand that reasoning. Mother Theresa was brilliant; she said, "I will never attend an anti-war rally. If you have a peace rally, invite me." You know, she knew. She understood the secret. I mean look what she manifested in the world. So if you're anti-war, be pro-peace. If you're anti-hunger, be pro-people having more than enough to eat. If you are anti-a particular politician, be pro-his opponent. Often elections are tipped in the favour of the person that the people are really against because he's getting all the energy and all the focus. You want to focus on what you want, not what you don't want. It's ok to notice what you don't want, because that gives you contrast to say, "well this is what I do want". But the fact is, the more you talk about what you don't want, or talk about how bad it is, read about all of that all the time and then say how terrible it is, well you're creating more of that. You know, so many times people say to me, "Well James, I have to be informed". Maybe you have to be informed. But you don't have to be inundated. Learn to become still, and to take your attention away from what you don't want, and all the emotional charge around it, and place the attention on what you wish to experience. I always say when the voice and the vision on the inside, become more profound, and more clear and loud, than the opinions on the outside, you've mastered your life. You're not here to try to get the world to be just like you want it to be. You are here to create the world around you that you choose, while you allow the world as others choose it to be to exist also. One of the questions I get asked all the time and its probably on somebody's mind right now if its not on yours, and that's the idea that if well, "If everyone uses The Secret, and they all treat the universe like a catalogue, aren't we going to run out of stuff? Won't everyone just make a run for it and bust the bank?" What's so beautiful about the teaching of the great secret is that there' s more than enough to go around for everyone. There is a lie that acts like a virus within the mind of humanity. And that lie is, there's not enough good to go around. There's lack and there' s limitation and there' s just not enough. That lie, has people living in fear, greed, stinginess, and those thoughts of fear, greed, stinginess and lack, become their experience. So the world has taken a nightmare pill. Now the truth is, there's more than enough good to go around. There's more than enough creative ideas, there's more than enough power, there's more than enough love, there's more than enough joy. All of this begins to come through a mind that is aware of its own infinite nature. Every great teacher who has ever walked the planet has told us that life was meant to be abundant. And so, just when we think that resources are dwindling, we find new resources to achieve the same things. So even though we say we have lack, it's because we don't open up our vision and see all of what is around us. You know when everyone starts to live from their heart, and go for what they want. They don't go for the same things. That's the beauty of this... We don't want BMWs. We don't all want the same person. We don't all want the same experiences. We don't all want the same clothing. We don't all want the... fill in the blank. There's enough for everyone. If you believe it, if you can see it, if you act from it. It'll show up for you. That's the truth. So let the variety of your reality thrill you, as you get to choose from among it, those things that you're wanting. And when you see something that you want in your experience, think about it. Find the feeling place of it. Get inside of it. Talk about it and write it down. Write a script about it. Make it your reality by becoming a match to it. And when you see those things that you are not wanting in your experience, do not talk about them. Don not write about them. Don't join groups that worry about them. Don't push against them. Do your best to ignore them. Remove your attention from the things that you do not want, while you give your undivided attention to the things that you do want. Most of the leaders in the past missed the great part of the Secret, which is empowering and sharing with others. This is the best time to have ever been alive in history. It's the first time we've ever had the power to gain knowledge at our fingertips. When we look around us, even at our own bodies, what we see is the tip of the iceberg. Think of this for a moment. Take your hand and look at it. Now your hand looks solid, but it's really not. If you put it under a proper microscope, you'd see a mass of energy vibrating. Everything is made up of the exact same thing, whether it' s your hand, whether it' s the ocean, or whether it' s a star. Everything is energy, and let me help you understand that just a little bit. There's the Universe, of course, and our galaxy and our planet and then individuals, and then inside of this body are organ systems and then there' s cells and then there' s molecules and then there' s atoms, and then there is energy. So there are a lot of levels to talk about something on. I don't care what city you're living in, you've got enough power in your body, potential power, to illuminate the whole city for nearly a week. Most people define themselves by this finite body, but you're not a finite body. I mean, even under a microscope you're an energy field. What we know about energy is this. You go to a quantum physicist and you say "What creates the world?" And he or she will say, "Energy." Well describe energy. Okay, it can never be created or destroyed, it always was, always has been, everything that ever existed always exists, it's moving into form, through form and out of form. Okay great. You go to a theologian and you ask the question, "What created the Universe?" And he or she will say, "God". Okay, describe God. Always was and always has been, never can be created or destroyed, all that ever was, always will be, always moving into form, through form and out of form. You see, it' s the same description, just different terminology. And so, if you think you're this meat suit running around, think again. You're a spiritual being, you're an energy field, operating in a larger energy field. We're all connected. We just don't see it. There isn't an out there and an in here. Everything in the universe is connected; it is just one energy field. You are extensions of Source energy. You are here in these magnificent bodies, but your bodies have distracted you for the most part from who you really are. You are Source energy... You are eternal beings, you are God force. You are that which you call God. Scripturally we could say that we are the image and the likeness of God. We could say we are another way that the Universe is becoming conscious of itself. We could say that we are the infinite field of unfolding possibility. All of that would be true. Every great tradition has told you, that you were created in the image and the likeness of the creative source. That means that you have God potential and power to create your world, and you are, you are. And maybe you've created things to this point that are wonderful and worthy of you, and maybe you haven't. The question I'd ask you to consider is, do the results you have in your life, are they what you really want, and are they worthy of you? If they're not worthy or you, then when would now, be the right time to change those, because you have the power to do that. You know, a lot of people feel like they're victims in life, and they'll often point to past events, perhaps growing up with an abusive parent or in a dysfunctional family. And I would add as a parenthesis here, that most psychologists believe that about 85% of families are dysfunctional, so it's like, all of a sudden you're not so unique. My parents were alcoholics. My dad abused me, my mother divorced him when I was six. From the age of thirteen to eighteen I was involved in street gangs. I had a, severe motorcycle accident. I was homeless at one point in Dallas. I lived in poverty for fifteen years in Houston. When I was a child I had learning difficulties and I was considered learning disabled and I was told I would never read write or communicate, never amount to anything, not go very far in life. I mean, that' s almost everybody' s story in some form or not. So that's just called, "so what". The real "what" is, what are you going to do now? What do you choose now? Because you can either keep focusing on that, or you can focus on what you want. And when people start focusing on what they want, what they don't want falls away. And that part expands, and the other part disappears. We are wanting you to come to the place where you are beginning to offer your thought deliberately, where you're guiding your thoughts on purpose, where you are the creator of your own experience because you are the manager of your own thoughts. The beautiful thing about the law of attraction is that you can begin where you are, and you can begin to think, real thinking, and you can begin to generate within yourself a feeling tone of harmony and happiness. The law will begin to respond to that. So now you start to have different beliefs, like there is more than enough in the Universe. Or you have the belief that everything goes right for me. Or you have the belief that, I'm not getting older, I'm getting younger. We can create it the way we want it, by using the law of attraction. And you can break yourself free from your hereditary patterns, cultural codes, social beliefs, and prove once and for all that the power within you is greater than the power that's in the world. Some of you may be thinking, "Well that's very nice, but I can't do that," or "She wont let me do that!" or "He'll never let me do that," or "I haven't got enough money to do that!" or "I'm not strong enough to do that," or "I'm not rich enough to do that," or "I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!". Every single "I'm not", is a creation. Are there any limits to this? Absolutely not. We are unlimited beings. We have no ceiling. The capabilities and the talents and the gifts and the power that is within every single individual that is on this planet, is unlimited. There is no blackboard in the sky on which God has written your purpose; your mission in life. There's no blackboard in the sky that says, "Neale Donald Walsch... a handsome guy... who lived in the first part of the twenty-first century who, colon. And then there' s a blank, you know. And all I have to do to really understand what I'm doing here, why I'm here, is to find that blackboard and find out what God really has in mind for me. But the blackboard doesn't exist. So your purpose is what you say it is, your mission is the mission you give yourself. Your life will be what you create it as, and no-one will stand in judgment of it, now or ever. It took a lot of years for me to get this, because I grew up very much with this idea that, you know, there was something I was supposed to do, and if I wasn't doing it I was like, God wouldn't be happy with me, you know. And when I really got that my primary aim was to feel and experience joy, then I began to do only those things which brought me joy. We have a saying, you know, "If it 'aint fun, don't do it", you know. Joy, love, freedom, happiness, laughter. That's what it is. And if you just experience joy sitting there and meditating for an hour, by golly, do that. If you experience joy eating a salami sandwich, then do that. When I pet my cat I'm in a state of joy, when I walk in nature I'm in a state of joy. So I want to constantly put myself in that state. And when I do that, then all I have to do is have the intention of what I want, and what I want manifests. So inner happiness actually is the fuel of success. Anything that makes you feel good is always going to be drawing in more. You are listening to this program right now. It's you that drew this into your life, and it's your choice whether you want to take it and utilise it. If it feels good, if it doesn't feel good, then you know, let it go. Find something that feels good, that resonates with your heart. Joseph Campbell said, "Follow your bliss." We think those are the best words we have ever heard spoken from a human tongue... and if one could follow one' s bliss, you would follow the trail to abundance and well-being on all subjects. Enjoy life with us. Because life is phenomenal. It's a magnificent trip. You will live in a different reality, a different life. And people will look at you and say, "What do you do different from me?" Well the only thing that is different is that you work with the Secret. And then you can do and have and be things that people once said that' s impossible for you for you to do and have and be. We're really now moving into a new era. It's the era where the last frontier is not space, as Star Trek would say, but it's going to be mind. I see a future of unbounded potential. Unbounded possibilities. Remember we're using at most 5% of the potential of the human mind. 100% human potential, is the result of proper education, so imagine a world where people were using their full mental and emotional potential. We could go anywhere. We could do anything. Achieve anything. See yourself with the good that you desire. Every religious book tells us that. Every great book on Philosophy. Every great leader. All the avatars who have ever lived. Go back and study the wise ones. Many of them have been presented to you in this program. You know what? They all understood one thing. They understood the Secret. Now you understand it. And the more you use it, the more you'll understand it. You may be feeling that it would be easier to be hearing these words if they had come to you the first day of your experience upon this earth. And if we were talking to you on your first day of physical life experience, we would say to you, Welcome to planet Earth. There is nothing that you cannot be or do or have. You are magnificent creator, and you are here by your powerful and deliberate wanting to be here. Go forth, giving thought to what you are wanting, attracting life experience to help you decide what you want, and once you have decided, giving thought only unto that. Most of your time will be spent collecting data, data that will help you decide what it is you want. But your real work is to decide what you want and then to focus upon it. For it is through focusing upon what you want you will attract it. That is the process of creating. I believe that you're great. That there's something magnificent about you. Regardless of what has happened to you in your life. Regardless of how young or how old, you think you might be. The moment you began to think properly, there's something that is within you, there's power within you that's greater than the world. It will begin to emerge. It will take over your life. It will feed you, it will clothe you. It will guide you, protect you. Direct you. Sustain your very existence, if you let it. Now that is what I know for sure. Be easy about this. Have fun with it. There is nothing you are supposed to do, only that which you want to do. 5@y3
