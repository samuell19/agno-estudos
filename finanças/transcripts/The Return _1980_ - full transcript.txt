There will be a helicopter available as soon as we touch down. Sir I think we have dated the star pattern from the rock your daughter photographed. My god. It's today. [jet noise] [Federal Agent 1] Well sir, it's pretty much as you predicted. It appears that the deputy and the scientist has come across certain information sir. Uh, information that could be misinterpreted by the media. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand. [footsteps] [Motel Manager] It's probably none of my business where you've been but your father has been trying to get in touch with you real bad. [Jennifer] When did he call? Oh he started calling this morning but I told him you hadn't been in all night. Thanks. Can you make the call for me now please. Great. What am I supposed to tell my father that my equipment is being systematically destroyed by UFOs? Yeah. I tried to scare you away. I tried to turn the others against you.
