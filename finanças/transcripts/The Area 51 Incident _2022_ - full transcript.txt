5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Doug? Give us a minute, will you? Sure. Doug, sorry to bother you. It's the readings. They fluctuating far beyond the normal range. They're growing exponentially. Albert, you said that last month. I'm sure everything is fine. Just keep a close eye on it and report back to me tomorrow. Doc, this isn't like last month. This is unprecedented. Something abnormal is happening. Oh, there's always something abnormal happening here, Albert. And do you really think today is a good day for your kid to visit the facility? I see no reason not. Besides, this placement has taken nearly a year to organize. He's very excited and I'm not going to let him down. Look, I'll send Nolan across you to discuss your findings with him, all right? OK. Are you nervous? No. I'm fine, actually. Oh, yeah. But you are. I can't believe we are actually here. My dad has been going on about this place for years. Yeah. Well, I worked really hard to get this placement. So-- Sorry. What was that supposed to mean? I just don't think it's fair that you got first choice. What GPA did you get? 4. Same here. Really? You want proof? No. Forget it. I guess you're here on merit too. Yeah, I am. Done. You want some? Hello. Hi. You must be Trent and you must be Jenny. Hello. Hi. Doug's told me a lot about you guys. You guys looking forward to this? Mm-hmm. We don't normally have placements here, let alone two. I mean, this place is so secure that sometimes I can't even get in. No, thank you so much. It's amazing. I heard you went through quite the vetting process. Although, transit does pay to have your old man be chief scientific officer, huh? Well, yeah. He does speak highly of you though. So listen, I'm going to give you a tour. Then I'm going to take you over to see Doug. And I think he's got a surprise for you. These guns are so cool. It's a bit excessive. It's cool. Blisters, these are the placements that Doug told you about. They've been through security already but they only have these temp IDs. OK, head on through to the main gate. What kind of guns are they? No idea. That's so cool. That's so sick. Wow, it's so cool. What is that? Get down. It's the remnants of a safety experiment. I guess it didn't pass safety regulations. It needed a few tweaks. So what do they actually sell in the vending machines? Is it normal-- Nolan. Yes? Requested to see you in the observation room. OK, I'll be there shortly. OK, see you later. Guys, I've been requested. So I'm going to have to cut this a bit short. I think I've got a bit of time to give you a quick stop briefing. That's fine. Shotgun. I was wondering when am I going to get to see an alien purse. I thought that's what they Like I mean, am I going to see one singing, or what's the plan? And you've come to see aliens. So is this where you tell us about all the secrets of you guys get up to? Trent? It could be a bit more nonchalant. Well, sort of. But listen, guys, I am going to have to be brief. But do either of you know what the primary purpose of this facility is? In 1951, a frequency was detected at this site. Upon further investigation, a rift was discovered. A rift? Like a wormhole. It emitted frequencies that were suggestive of something cognitive and intelligence. Intelligent? You mean like an alien? We didn't know at first. But after time, yes, I believe that to be true. You see, this built around that rift to keep it under close observation. And who created this rift? No idea. But on rare occasions, it amplifies. And it is growing stronger year on year. Has anyone ever tried to go through it? We have attempted to put signal emitters through. But on every occasion, except one, the portal disintegrates it. What happened on the other? We put the emitter through, it passed and it didn't come back. So can you still detect it with this device? No. One theory is that it is on Kepler 22B, which is the nearest habitable planet to Earth. But that is over 620 light years away. So that means it'll take 620 years for it to come back? Precisely. If signals can't travel through, then what are you measuring? Well, one theory is that it is the make up of the portal itself. It is building blocks, like a form of radiation. And it is growing stronger day by day. Well, another theory is it's a countdown. Hey, dad. Hello, Trent. Now, you must be Jenny. Pleasure to finally meet you. Thank you so much for this opportunity, sir. Please, call me Doug. Dad, how come you never told me about this place? You, on the other hand, can call me sir. Let's try and keep things a little more formal around here, shall we? Nolan, Albert's after you in the chamber just now. Yes. I'll head over there now. I'll see over there. Sure. We'll be along presently. Enjoy the rest of your tour, guys. Thanks. You all right? Just doesn't mix too well with the liquor these days. I'm good. I'm good. There's a guy out there have been giving you the eye all night. Looks minted. I can't do this shit anymore. That's an eye catching dress. Thanks. What'd you do? It's a secret. All right. In you come. Help yourselves over there and take a look at that. I guess this is the rift. Oh, my God. It's amazing. Isn't it just? Here, listen to this. So is the portal getting stronger? Well, that's Albert's theory. Although honestly, every day, I hear a new one. He was just telling me about yet another revised critical level just now. After 10 years, I think no one has any idea. Critical level? Well, Albert thinks once it reaches that level, an event will occur. Well, the frequencies were amplifying, getting closer and closer. And that's all finished when-- When the last emitter transfer through? Well done, Jenny. Someone's paying attention. I like it. And yes, exactly. What's happened? I don't know. Nolan? Albert? I don't-- that guy's right in front of it. Oh, my God. That is so cool. Trent! Trent, come back here! I think it's at critical mass. You were right. What are we doing now? I don't know. I have no idea. Wait. I think I see something. Nolan, what are you doing? Nolan? Nolan, come back. Lower your weapons. Nolan. Nolan! Get up! Get up! Come. Go! OK, where are we going? I need to get you somewhere safe. Oh, God. I'll explain when we get there. The nearest secure facility is the Withnail base. Well, dead. Why are we going there? It's an old military bunker. We used to use it when the systems were being upgraded at unit 51. And what about mom? What do we do? There are procedures in place to deal with this. Mom will know what to do. But if you need to call her, go ahead. Let her know what's happening. Yeah. Yeah, but what about my parents? Where did they live? They live on Rosemary.. It's the other side of the basement. Look, I'm going to drop you two off. You hook up with Trent's mother, and then I'll go after your parents after, OK? I'll give you folks a call, let them know it's not safe. And they need to stay indoors. All right, see you there. Bye. She's coming. She's coming. Well, there's no signal. Let me have your phone. Where's yours? I'll try, I'll try-- It's the portal. It's interfering with the network. I'll try and help. I'll try and help. Calm down. My dad has one of those old school radios. Can we get one of them? Yeah, sure. We can try the bunker. Yeah. Hang on. Just let me check the radio frequencies. Breaking news. Reports are coming in from across the state of unidentified creatures who have so far killed several people. Eyewitness statements speak of the creatures emerging from a nearby military base. As yet, there are no-- Dad, how can any of this be under control? However, we have been told that-- Everyone, Helen, we've got to go. You got your keys, yeah? No, I didn't bring the car. I got a lift today. Shit. All right. Come on, we'll figure something. Oh, my God. All right, out! Everyone, out now! Get out! Out of here! Hey, you. Think you're funny? Where is it, eh? Leave her alone! What's that? Come on. Go. Holy crap. What is that thing? Who cares? Just drive. Dad, it's mom's car. She's here. She's here. I don't understand. There should be a century here. All right, look. Let's proceed, but stay close. And try not to make too much noise. It seems to attract them. Let's find your mother. Hey, mom. Come on. This way. Looks pretty quiet. Let's carry on. Look. Come on. Open the fucking door! Hey! Keep your voice down, will you? There's creatures out there. It's not safe. We need to get inside now. Help us. Are you all right? Were in town and then she-- It's my blood sugar. I forgot my insulin. This is Sergeant. This is a restricted area. Leave immediately. Sergeant, my name is Douglas Clark. I am executive operations director at British area 51. I am requesting access. One moment. You know what's going on out there. Open this damn door. The civilians with you are unauthorized. Separate them from your group and I'll grant you access. They are in need of assistance. Open this door now. And that is an order. One moment. Come on. Open this door now! Open it! Come on. Move it. Move it. Move it. Move, move. Move it Move it. Jake, come on. Let's go. Let's go! Move it. Let's go, man. Move, move, move, move! Move! Move! Jake, get inside now! Listen here and follow me. What the hell is going on out there? right here. Are you all OK? What do you think? We could have died out there. We thought this place was empty! I mean, we were screaming for help for 15 minutes! Hey. Calm down, OK? I'm sorry. I'm only following orders. We didn't know what to do. Jesus Christ. I mean, he's all for us to enter here, isn't he? No, he's not, OK? Yeah. But what the fuck is that about? You're just going to leave us out there to die. Huh? Hey, we're told you don't let authorized personnel in. All right? Come on. This isn't helping. All right. Who is in charge here because you too sure as hell aren't? Lieutenant Bain. He's in the command center. Yeah, but what about my parents? We will get to that, Jenny. I promise you. I just got to check in with this Bain fellow first. We're going to need his help. All right, Sergeant. Lead the way. OK, follow me. Jake, can you make sure you get these guys to the residential quarters? Roger, sir. Thanks. You better come too. You'll be all right. Oy, come on. Let's go. Oh. It'll be all right. Come on. Why is there so many here? They were let go from an old training program we had. So how much do you know about this situation we have outside? Nothing. So that's down to Lieutenant Bain to tell you. We'll be seeing him momentarily. All right. What sort of state's the bunker in? What's the layer? Well, the bunker's comprised of three floors. The top floor is the living quarters. The middle is the command center. And the bottom houses all the industrial elements as well as the second exit. And how many of you are there in here at present? A handful. We have many more due to arrive, which is why we should not facilitate any unauthorized personnel. With all due respect, Sergeant, out in that chaos I don't think many more will make it here. Capaldi, who's your friends? The young guy's name is Colt. He's a soldier. And Doug here says he's from Area 51, sir. Did you disobey my orders? Sir-- I said, did you disobey my orders? Sir. Yes, sir. Leftenant Bain, I presume? Douglas Clark. Hi, Doug. Peter. But we can forego the formality since we're sidestepping the top secret nature of everything. We have no idea what these things are, where they came from, or how to get rid of them. Is the facility secure? This place? Oh, yeah, man. This place was designed to withstand the end of the world. But that was 70 years ago. That's credentials. What's your deal, Doug? I was executive director of operations at Area 51. Oh, shit. Why don't you open with that? What's going on? A rift like a wormhole reached a critical state today and many hostile unidentified lifeforms swarmed through it. The compound was overrun and completely wiped out. We barely escaped. Unidentified life forms. You got to be shitting me. Well, thanks for the heads up. What's the protocol? What's the plan? There isn't one. It didn't go as expected. Well, guys, it's my mission to look over this facility and protect the safety of the bunker. If you guys help me with that, we'll be cool, OK? But I'll let you in on a little secret. We're a little underfunded. So we really have the supplies for sustained habitation. We'll get to that later. Firstly, I need access to your communications rooms. See if I can reestablish contact with the outside. No. Firstly, I need to know who else is with you. My wife, son, and a graduate from the facility. Two other civilians outside, sir. One of them's wounded. Great. So everybody got a plus 1. Awesome. Jenny? Yeah. Look, I would try and stay calm over it because they're going to go out and get your parents now. I know. It's just that my phone's dead. So if the signal comes back, they can't get to me. Look, I'm sorry that we couldn't go out and collect your parents en route. No, I get it. I'm just freaking out a little bit. Well, they're soldiers. So I would trust them. But I have something that might help distract you. If you don't take it, I'm going to eat it all. So come on. You've got 5 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2-- there we go. Thanks. It's OK. You all right? Come on. Let's get you in there. You're not getting any better, are you? I feel really sick. All right. Hang on. Here. Here. Here, here. I'm fine. Maybe she should go to the infirmary. I said I'm fine, OK? Stop worrying. She's a stubborn bitch. She always has been. I'm going to get you some water. Can I get you anything? No. Hey, Helen, you've never been this bad before. Maybe we should tell him what happened out there. I mean, if you caught something? Absolutely not. Do you want them to throw us out of here? Because that is exactly what they will do. They didn't want to let us in the first place. So stop, all right? I'm fine. I just need to sleep it off. I'll be fine in the morning. Hey, you know how this shit goes. It's everyone for themselves. Do you think you could get me some antibiotics or something? It's really stinging. I think some of that shit from earlier I got into it. Feels like an infection. Yeah, right. I'll be right back, yeah? And when you get through to your folks, tell them to only bring the essentials, all right? OK. All set it up. You want to try and get in touch with them? Dad? Dad, come in. It's Jenny. Dad? Jenny. Oh, dad. Oh, thank God. Where are you? Are you OK? Are you guys all right? Yeah. We've been so worried. It's fine. I'm at a military compound. The officers from my placement, they took me here. I'm safe. Are you OK? There are these things. These creatures. They're everywhere. You know the factory compound unit? Yeah. If you head there, then we'll come and get-- someone will come and get you. Dad? Dad? Dad is not-- the signal is broken. It's not working. OK. I don't think they heard where he needed-- he needed to go. I'm so sorry. It's dead. Well, you need to go and get them now because they're in danger. Well, they can't get here on their own. You're fucking soldiers! You're not going to say anything? You said you'll go and get them. And I believed you. This whole thing is your fucking fault! You promised me. I did. And I shall keep it. I'll keep it. The site's 20 years ago. It was a military base. I know it well. Thank you, sir. I need you to look after your mother for me, all right? I don't want you to go. Come on, dad. Trent. I know this is far from ideal. But it's the only solution I've got. Jenny's parents are out there. I have to try and bring them back. Imagine if it was me and your mother. Just. Trent, please. I have to try and help them. I need you to be strong. You're in charge now, buddy. Look after mom, all right? Trent, your dad used to work there. Don't worry. He knows that place. He'll be fine. Hurry back, all right? Hey, you're not going alone. What about your orders? Fuck them. I'm only doing this job to protect the people. And that girl, she needs us. I'm going to need you more than ever. Clear. Move out. Let's move. We need to be quick. One can appear at any minute. So, working with your dad-- that's got to be tiring. Or it can be testing. I like being around him. I hardly ever see him if I weren't. Well, he's out there with two of my best guys, and they'll have his back. Yeah, thanks. And it's OK to worry. We all worry. Worried about a couple of people out there myself right now. But we stick together, we'll be OK. Yeah. I'll tell you what-- I think there's some cards around here somewhere. Why don't you grab Jenny and take your mind off everything, all right? Sounds good. Yeah. And deal me in for some hold them. Come back and I'll kick your ass. Sure. I like that smile. That's a tell. I got your number. Do you think they're already there? I'm sure they're fine. Just keep an eye out, Jake. It's not safe. OK, you two. We're here. I don't understand. They should be here by now. Or maybe they've gone to the secondary entrance to the site. This is too quiet. It doesn't feel right. Keep your gun up, soldier. Always be ready. You OK? Yeah. I heard what you said. I'm sorry. What for? For being horrible to you before. Yeah. Well, that feels like ages ago now. God, I can't believe this is happening. I know. It's crazy. I can't imagine what's going to be out there when we finally get out. Maybe the military are winning. Yeah. Well, whilst we wait for that, how about I beat you at cards? Give it a go. Where are they? I guess if they wanted to avoid the main entrance, they'd have come in by the service road. That would have put them at the rear of the engineering buildings. So where are they? Whatever we do, we'd better do it fast. Quick. This way. Look, go to bed, mom. Trent, no. I need to go and make contact with your father. Yeah, I will go make contact, all right? If I get anything, I'll wake you up. OK. Yeah. Come on. Oh, this is great. Which way now? I'm not too sure. Lot of these structures aren't the same as they were 20 years ago. All right. I think we should spread up. Are you stupid? Why? That's what they do in movies. What kind of movies? The kind where all the characters die one by one horribly. Come on. This way. Come on. If you can hear me, just tell me that you're OK. Trent, is that you? Look, we're at the warehouse, but we can't find Jenny's parents. Hey. You all right? Yeah. You've-- here. It's for your face. Oh. No. I wouldn't. It's all right. I'm dressed way too nice for an alien invasion anyway. Thanks. Listen, thanks for bringing us here. I mean, if it wasn't for you, then-- well, I don't know what would have happened. There's no thanks necessary. How is she holding up? Yeah, she'll be fine. My name isn't actually Rose by the way. It's Elaine. Well, it's nice to finally meet you, Elaine. Still Colt. Oh excuse me. Let me get that. Please. This is my wallet. Why have you got this? You knew I was a soldier, didn't you? To think I was actually going to ask you out. Wait, look. Please look, I'm sorry. These tunnels, they have a second exit? Yes. There should be one to the rear. So come on, man. What are we waiting for? Let's get out of here, man. Stop, stop, stop. Kevin, is that you? Look, Jenny is safe. She's with us. I have soldiers with me. We've come to take you to her. But we need to leave right away. Kevin? Is Jenny's mother with you? Are you all right? Did you hear that? Fuck! Where's Doug? I swear he was right behind us. Where'd you go, old man? Doug! Doug! Helen? Hey, Helen. Someone help us please! Somebody help! What's up with her? I don't know. I don't know. Just do something, please. Help her up. We'll get to the infirmary. Come on. Come on. I've got you. Come on. Where's Doug? Do you think he died? Where the fuck is Doug? Fuck! Come on. Come in. You got her, you got her, you got her... Put her on bed, put her on the bed! Get the light on. Excuse me, excuse me. She needs oxygen. Here, hold this. Hold this. Isn't a case of not taking medication. What's going on with her? What happened outside? She's been getting progressively worse since we got here. I don't know, all right? We were at the bar when all this started and she just got ill, OK? Look out. Look out. She's going to be all right, isn't she? I need to get some supplies. I'll be right back. We need a doctor. She's freezing. Anybody got any blankets? I'll check the and see if they got any. Colt, please. I can't lose her. I know. Just keep an eye on her. I'll be right back. Do you fancy another game? Yeah. What was that? Is everything OK? I saw something crawling under her skin. What? Yeah. You sure? Mm-hmm. I mean, you've seen how she's been since you got here. She's hiding something from us. They both are hiding something from us. We need to be on guard, OK? What's going on? The lady, Helen, she's having a fit convulsing. Did either of you see anything out of the ordinary? Like what? You know, she's infected and convulsing, and that's not from the insulin. Well, yeah. But she's been getting worse the longer she's been in. Yeah. Well, we'll keep an eye on it. You guys head to the control room. I'm going to find something to combat the infection right away. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Thanks. Fuck! I don't understand. Why would he just leave us out here, man? He's in a fuck-load of trouble when we get back. How we got to get out of here? What do we do now, man? Listen to me. We'll find a car, we're going to get the fuck out of here. Oh, fuck! She's not going to get any better, isn't she? Look at me. Look at me. She's not going to be OK. It's all right. You're doing great. You're doing really great, all right? We're just going to help her get her cleaned up, all right? Yes. Don't tell-- Bastard! Why did you do that? She was infected and she would not have survived. She was putting everyone at risk! You don't fucking know that! I need you to pick her up and get her into the chryo chamber. We need to seal her in to stop the spread of infection. Get out! Get out! She's dead. She's gone. I'm so sorry. What would be without her. What am I going to do? You good, soldier? Come on. I need you to help me with something. I'm sorry but we have to go get cleaned up. We don't know if this is contagious. Pete. Pete! Are we sure we should be doing this? You think I want to be fucking shooting civilians? The safety of this bunker is my top priority, Colt. OK? If anybody gets infected, they get eliminated. That's protocol. Can we not just isolate them? No. Once they're infected, there's no saving them, OK? Listen, there's an incinerator around the corner. I want you to make sure that it's running. I'm going to go up and get her body and bring her down. She has to be disposed of so we can avoid contamination. Got it? OK. OK. Laurie. Oh, shit. Laurie, I'm so sorry. I had no idea he was going to do that. Everything's fucked. I don't know what's going on. We have to do these things to survive. Laurie? God! Fuck! Dad. Jenny, it's my dad. Well, did you see anyone else? Go on, see him. My dad's pretty open. You can come with me. We can go up and see. I said it's OK. Look, I'll come back, OK? Colt! Colt! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Jesus Christ! She's infected. She tried to kill me. The thing I put it. It's in there. It's dead. OK. OK. All right. Get her body in there. I'll go upstairs and bring back Helen. OK. Where are you? Where are you? OK. OK. I got you. I got you. I got you. OK. OK. All right. Where are you? Where are you? Jenny. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Where's Trent? His dad just got back. So he's going to see him. What? Well, we saw him on the monitor. That's not possible. Why? Because I'm the only one with the key in and out of here. Shit. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Where am I? Where the fuck am I? Fuck, fuck. Doug? Doug? Doug? Doug? Doug, is that you? We got to get out of here! Oh, fuck. Somebody help me! Jenny, you know how to handle one of these? Well, all right. Yeah. Jenny, Laurie is gone, OK? She got infected. The facility is compromised. We don't tell him. Trent. We don't tell him about Laurie. We need him to focus on getting out of here. Right. Do you think Helen brought it in? Yeah. There was something gestating inside of her. Well, how do we know that we don't have it? Well, we don't. Let's go. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Hey. Dad. Hey, hey. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? I was so worried I wouldn't see you again. Dad, we should go and see mom. Dad? Dad, you're so cold. It's not my dad. It's not my dad. If anyone can hear me, I am in the communication room, and we need to get out of here. It's not safe. Where is he? Back this way. Come on. It's Elaine. Fuck. We got to get Trent. Come on! Trent. Trent. Trent. Trent, come on. We need to go. Where's my dad? That wasn't my dad. Where's my dad? Trent, we need to go. Trent! Trent, look at me! Look at me! Trent! She's at the bunker entrance, OK? We need to go now. OK? Come on. Come on. It's OK. Everyone's dead. Come on. Up, up, up. Up. Up. Come on. Come on. Where are we Going The facility has been compromised. At the bottom of the bunker, there's some secret tunnels that lead to the back exit. 10, 100. Who gives a fuck? We just got to get to the back exit and get the hell out of here. And the three of us will be OK. What do you mean three? I thought you said my mom was there. Come on, Trent. We need to go. Come on! On me. On me. Look at me, Trent. Trent. Hide. What was that? I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure they're communicating with each other. I think the little one's called out to the big one, and the big one called out to God knows what. Come on. Quiet. Quiet. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about your mom. It's OK. I just wanted you to get out. Come on. Trent? We're going to be OK.
