Ah, Maria, not "fool", right? Fool. Yeah, you're a fool. A fool is not crazy, crazy is not... I can't take this one. Who's the fool here? It's him, it's him! Help! Piconzé, calm down, calm down. It's me he's talking about. You're not a fool, you're a mule. That's right dad, I guess I really am a mule. Don't be like that. Now let's get some water from the river. Yeah, these kids are growing up. And my little granddaughter, Maria, is becoming a young woman. You know, António, I was thinking, I would like Maria and Piconzé... Yeah, he's a nice kid. Grandpa, Piconzé decided to go fishing. What he catches, my child, I'll find with my finger. [Bird and Pig: Inaudible] Uhm, the two of them are there for each other. If my son married her... And she married him. The river's water is so clean that I can see the bottom. And you, Fisherman? Hold on, I'm going to catch the biggest fish in the world. And your grandfather is going to burn all of his fingers and toes. You'll see. How nice it would be if we caught a really fat ham. A ham. Only if it was your ham. A ham? Is everybody crazy? There goes my ham. I got one. And it's a big one. Sardines. It's only an empty can. Grandpa is waiting for the fish you promised so he can cook it. I'm catching it. Nice. Now there's only the other foot missing. What is it, Chicão? Pull the boot. It's a piranha. Stop playing games and bring us our fish. [Inaudible] I'm feeling lucky today, I'm going to catch some more. I'm going, it's getting late. I'm going to prepare dinner. We're going. [whispering] It's settled. Today I'll finish off the fish in this river. [whispering] Grandpa! Look, Grandpa. Piconzé sent this for you. Eh, where did he buy this piranha? What can that be? Leave it to me, I'll check. ♪ It's the Bi- bi- bi- bi- bi- Bigodão. ♪ The King's gang. Bigodão, Bigodão. ♪ Look, it's Bigodão! ♪ Pa- pa- pa- ra- pa- pa ♪ - The King! ♪ Bigodão- dão. Bi- Bigodão. ♪ I'm going home! Look at the chaos in the square. By the looks of it, everyone is losing it. Is no one going to welcome me? Home, home, home. My dress! Chicken soup, chicken soup. Chicken soup, chicken soup! Get back here. Chicken soup! Oh, my! - Hahahahaha. Maria, Bigodão is coming to our house! Let's go! No! Not my little granddaughter! I'm coming! Let me go! Help, Grandpa! Hey! Somebody help me! Ah! Miserable pig! Let's go! [Inaudible] Maria! - Grandpa! Grandpa! Let's go, animal! Who's taking Maria? They took everything. Including my dentures. This can't go on like this, those bastards. They took my husband's dentures. And guess what they took from me. They took my little grandchild, Maria. God, don't let them hurt my Maria. Thugs, morons, murderers. Inconveniences! Who turned the lights off? They'll see! We need to teach these thugs a lesson! We'll teach these thugs a lesson! We'll teach these thugs a lesson. Stop it! You heard it right! And you'll have to help. Got it? Dad, leave it to me. I'll get Maria. But how, Piconzé? We've tried everything and we failed. With my help, it's going to be easy. Easy? I want to see it on the spot. ♪ Pa- pa- pa- ra- pa- pa. Pa- ra- pa- ra- pa. ♪ Pa- ra- pa- pa- ra- pa- ra- pa. ♪ Bigodão- dão. Bi- Bigodão. Bigodão. ♪ Pay attention, little girl. The boss is going to speak. Listen here, everybody. Let's eat and drink till we drop! Party! Doll, let's go inside. The house is ours. Go in, clean your little foot. Go in. Go inside. Ah! Were you also kidnapped? We were washing clothes and Bigodão's gang showed up. It's been a month and a half. And have you already tried to run away from here? It's very hard. This one time, we sent a note in a bottle asking for help. But we still haven't heard back. It's been a while, I think we should try again. Stop talking. There's laundry to do. Right now, the people back in the Village must be going insane. That's right. Extremely right, my dear Bigodão. They work and we eat. Very right. [Piconzé, Bird and Pig:] Bye, bye, bye. Be careful, my son. Hey, where are the clues? Yeah, this just got hard. There are three ways. Where are we going? I have no idea. - [Inaudible] North, northeast, south, southeast. I have a genius idea. I'll throw this stick. The side it falls on is the side we'll go to. Oh, no. Let's use Chicão's tail. Look. Hey, man. Hey, sir. What is it? I can't work in peace anymore. Go away. Don't get agitaded. Hey, old man. Tell me what's your business, sir? Go away or I'll shoot. That's how I work. No one steals my rocks. Even Bigodão went flying out of here. Chicão, did you hear what he said? Bigodão?! - Sir! Sir, you mentioned Bigodão. Do you know where he lives? I don't know, and I'm mad at those who do. I just know that the smoke got out of my gun and I saw mutes talking and cripples walking. That's a nice smell, sir. You think? I got lucky in the hunt today, my sons. If you want to have dinner with me, I'm having snake soup. Snake? It's all yours. - Bye! I really don't get it. When I decide to be nice, they ditch me. I'm better off alone than in bad company. My goodness. That's crazy. That snake thing wasn't planned. Did it rain? Today's not my day. I should've stayed home. The rain is coming from that branch. Hey, hey. It's a storm. Hey, I know that dude! And not from the zoo. It's my uncle! Uncle, look at me. You're Papo, my dear nephew. It's been a long time. How's my aunt? Is she still puffy? Look here, she decided to spend some time close. You mean she decided to spend some time away, right? And where did she go, Uncle? Close, close to a cage. She abandoned me and went to the zoo. After 200 years married. Right now, I just want total peace and quiet. Here's to freedom! Nice. Uncle, you must be around 400 years old now. How's your health? Perfect. The only thing that's bothering me is this ingrown feather. But it must be because I'm old. Look, this here is my group. And all of them are my friends. And you, what are you doing? Are you a boy scout? Almost. We're here to capture Bigodão's gang. Bigodão? I don't know. Hey, have you seen Bigodão? No. And you, have you seen Bigodão? No. Piupiu, have you seen him? No. Have you seen him, Côco? Côco? What time is it? The time? Hey, it's time. It's time! It's not me. It's not me. Hey, Corujão knows everything. You should ask him. He's around here at night. Corujão, wake up! Corujão, do you know where that thug is? Down, down. Do you know where Bigodão is? The thug. I'm not down, I'm like this. You know I don't get enough sun. Almost burst my eardrums! The only thug here is Bigodão. Bigodão! That's right! Do you know where he lives? Where does he live? I know. Let me see. That's it, it's close to the Abandoned Village. Not far from here. I've flown over that village before, guys. Leave it to me, and we'll get there. Nice job, Papo. Say thank you to Coruja and goodbye to your uncle. Let's go! We need to use our heads. That was nice of you, Uncle. Bye! Hugs and kisses. Best wishes. Have a good trip and a good hunt. If you need any help, fly back here. My Uncle is over 400 years old and he's still very intelligent. Mine was also like that, very intelligent. And now he's a ham. Don't say stuff like that. We've just arrived at the Abandoned Village. Let's see. Anyone here?! Maybe they went to church. Piconzé, Zépicon! It's all abandoned. What a sinister village. What a creepy thing. What can this be? A werewolf's foot? Piconzé, come here! What? Wow. - I think it's a big foot. Chico, have you been here before? Are you insane? It's not mine. Let's go. I'm running! Hey, where did he hide? Hey, gang, I'm up here. Help! I'll do it later. What a monster! Hey, you there. The monster that just passed is really not great company! He hurts the forest, scares the animals and also scares the Indians. He's bad! Not this one. Who are you? What are those legs? Are you related to Ganesha? I'm the jungle's protector and you? If you're not here to hurt us, I can help you. My feet are like this, turned around, so that no one can find me in the forest. We're looking for the thug, Bigodão. - Bigodão, the thug? - Did you see him? I know him from around here. He was here before, but the monster kicked him out. He went to the other side, close to the... The pond. Gang, let's go. Thank you so much for the information. The pleasure is all mine, we're here to help our friends. Be careful! He's dangerous! Bye! Let's camp here, scouts. What about the monster? No! Attack! Hey, Papo! Everything is ok! I knew you were going to make it. That's why I didn't even worry! What is that? Maria's handkerchief. It's a clue! Smoke! Wherever there's smoke, there's fire! Keep quiet! It must be the thugs. We need to find somewhere to hide. It's one of them. What do we do now? Attack! I have a plan. You go over there and... Yes, yes, yes. Ah. Good one! Who's there?! Show yourself! Speak or I'll shoot! [Inaudible] Hey, little pig. Come here, animal! Let's make a nice stew with you. It's me, animal. Come here! Stew. Come here, stew! Nice job! You guys stay there looking out. Be careful! If anything happens, call us! It's the thugs hiding place. This leg killed two of our men. I want a lot of music! A lot of music! Joy! Let's have fun! Maria! Where are you? Maria?! Piconzé, you're here! I'll find a way! Hold in there! Ok, Piconzé. What's happening? There's an idiot tickling me! Who are you, little kid? You're trapped! Piconzé, what happened? Piconzé, Piconzé! Well, I'm the Big Bigodão, Mr. Piconzé. Did you know that? The Great Bigodão! Let her go! I came to get Maria and take her with me! Let her go?! Attack! [Inaudible] Take the prisoner to the Bridge House. Let's go! It wasn't this time, Bigodão, but I'll beat you! [Inaudible] Hey, lift the bridge! Now, be quiet and dream with the angels. Cowards! I'll get out of here! I'll get out of here! Piconzé is taking a really long time. Yeah, I think something happened. Hey, look, the guy woke up! Captain, I heard a shot. Where there's a shot, there's blood. Wake up everybody! They have Maria and two other prisoners there! We need to think. Is it possible that there's no man here?! There are men, but we need strength. We need to get together and organize this. Chicão, be an intelligent pig and think of something. - They sent us a note. - Saying they want money and food. How are you going to do that if they took everything we had? I have an idea! We need a leader. A strong leader that can protect the weak! A leader! An outsider. How much would he ask? Maybe the minimum wage? The thing is, we need more strength! Who's going to look for it? Me?! This one is going to be easy. - Let's go look. Son, we're asking you. The responsibility is all yours. Leave it up to us. We'll find a way, Daddy. Let's go, gang. I can feel the smell of rain. I wonder if it's that rain again. That's right, Chicão. You can't run away from this bath. They're going to catch a cold with this rain. My little grandchild, I wonder where you are. They want to trade you with food, but we don't have anything left to eat. Maria! It's you! Here! I was dreaming. Hello! This one only has one leg! Piconzé, Piconzé. Look! What is that? - Hello, friends. [Inaudible] It must be one of his idols. - Don't touch it! This must be worth a fortune! I'm smelling burnt pig's tail. I'm getting scared. This castle looks like it's haunted, Chicão. It looks alive. I think I've seen this before. [Inaudible] Pipe decoration. Come look at these guys' faces. These are the kings that were previously in this castle. What a big diamond! [Inaudible] If it was ours, we could pay for an army of strong men and get rid of those thugs. Be careful! There must be a secret way out. This didn't smell right. Did you see a head anywhere? Guys, I found a secret passage. There's people coming! A treasure! [Inaudible] No more fooling around! Move, fast! My crown. - - She's waiting for you. Go! [Inaudible] Guard, what is happening? Your Majesty! Your Majesty! I found these outsiders around the trash deposit. Ambassadors of the Kingdom! Outsiders, I'm the Queen. Kiss my hand. Now it's your turn to smoke from the Pipe of Peace. No, thank you very much, Your Majesty. I don't smoke. When the Queen commands, everyone must obey! It must be really hard to walk on two legs. Your Majesty, these outsiders must be cripples. With two legs! Your pipe looks nice, outsider. Give it to me. It's a guitar, Your Majesty. Ok, that's it! Guards, lock them up! [Inaudible] Bastard! Where has this been seen?! Not bad, uh? Today we'll have roasted pig with a little apple in the mouth. Don't do this! Piconzé, don't let them do this! I don't even want to look. My God! Hey, calm down, you bastard! He's dreaming. [Inaudible] Are there any news? About the food. There's only a little bit. It'll only last four days. And the booze is already gone too. Hum, yes, yes. We better go look for more. Pass me the booze, Boss. - Go get the ladies! I would like to know what happened to Piconzé. - I don't think he ran away. - I think he did. He's not dumb. You'll see! I'm sure he'll be back to help us. I feel like smoking a cigar. Matador, give me a cigar! Wow! Smoke a little bit there. The ladies. Now let's draw lots and see who gets to go home. Place your bets. Let's go. Not on me, you idiot! You! Look, a thug! Those miserable thugs! Pigs! Not pigs. Come here! Keep it down, Chicão! - Calm down. [Inaudible] Attention! Money and food for the lady. Otherwise, I'll kill her! Oh my God, they're going to kill that girl and we haven't done anything about it! Papo, go look for help! Hekp! I need a man! Where's there a brave man? Attention! Skill and a lot of experience in necessary! We need a strong man! Did you say “man”? I have a whip! Nobody can take me! Great! - - Let's go! This job is mine! This one must be good! And I can throw knives. Do you want to see it? [Inaudible] I'm gonna show you how good I am! [Inaudible] This one is even stronger! My arrow catches thugs! [Inaudible] This is the man we need! Ah, mommy, mommy! Mommy! There's no one left. I'm feeling an abnormal hunger. It's thundering. It's going to rain. That's my belly rumbling. Chicão, you're acting strange. Here they come! The other way! I wonder what they are doing. He- He- He- He- Help! He- He- He- Help Me! How strange. Li- listen, I fell in a ba- bad way. Let me guess, you were with Bigodão's gang and you fell off the horse. Wh- What? I was ru- running away from them. Chicão, give him a hand. - Leave it to me. Now that you're our friend. Listen here, where can we get food? I- I think you can get it in that little hou- hou- house over the- there. Let's go there. Hey, I can see smoke, I think they are cooking. Here I come. Just for me. I'll put my belly out of misery. Anyone here? Well? What a miserable house. My pigsty is much fancier. Where is the kitchen? Everything ok, Chicão? What a pleasure to have you here, my grandchildren. Time to eat. You'll try the soup I made. The smell is pleasing. And it's not pig's meat. Ready, enjoy your meal! A chicken! Oh, it turned into a chick. The next meal is one of my specialties. You're going to love it! It looks like pasta. I'll take my chances. My hunger is not normal! Let's go, kids. Weren't you hungry? Now, eat! What a terrible food. Hey, it feels like soap. What is it? Did you not like the seasoning? Now I'll get it! Piconzé, what's in this meal? Well, dessert is on its way. Chicão, I don't think I'm going for this one. I can't stand it! Be careful! I wonder what happened to my musical wind pastries. Genial! Witchy really! Hey, Piconzé, Chicão is really wild. Right, you should call him. [Inaudible] Chicão, haven't you noticed that the witch has bewitched you? Let's go. Turtle! Go inside your house, close your eyes and I'll solve this! A- A- Alright. 3, 2, 1, now! - Spider! - I'm coming! Come here! How many times have I told you that you have to be careful when building your doors? Right, just because we have guests, you think I'm just going to work and work. Shut your mouth and go work! Hey, Turtle, you have some friendships... Me? No... Oh, you bastard! You'll pay for what you're doing! Turtle! Turtle! Hey, Papo. What happened? I have no idea. Piconzé?! Chicão?! Where can they be? Someone get me out of here! Leave to me, I can get you! Now, Piconzé, Picon... Ah! Give me my pants back! Get dressed. Where's Chicão? I don't know. La- last time I sa- saw him, he was go- going to the river. Hey, gang, I got one! A skeleton! You're getting there, Chicão! Try again! You're saying that like it's easy! Gentlemen, please. Those fish are mine. Can you take just one? - - I want both of them. A tea spoon, Sir. Please. You, Sir, are the man we're looking for. Help us get rid of those thugs! - - Thugs? The ones that kidnapped the girls. I'll give you the fish. And I can get more. Help us. Are you going to help, Sir? I am peaceful. Lover of peace. And I hate fighting. But it's the only way. They're mean and we're weak. That's not my problem. You'll have to figure it out on your own. You're already a man. Go away, young man! Then help me handle the weapons. Handle the weapons? You're crazy. We could give it a shot... Don't you understand we need your help, Sir? I give up! Stop! Ok, young man. Your persistence has convinced me. Follow me. Nice! Very well. I believe you've been through some tough times. Let's go eat something and think about what we can do. We're home! I can't believe this! Real food! I think I'm going to faint. You! You're going to have to eat outside. These kids. Look, the position of the wrist is very important. It requires a lot of practice. This one won't fly again. Now, you try. Chicão, get us more ammunition. Practice, a lot of practice. Now, let's try some new throws. Let's try with a branch. Work and persistence. Now, you'll learn new hits. You're a good student. You're almost approved. Continue practicing. Attention! We're reaching the end of our classes. And now, let's move to another test. The moving target. Now! This is going very well. Let's move on to the last test. I'm ready. Let's go. - Hooray! Hooray! Hey, thank you. I was missing dessert. No, you have to put that on your head. Piconzé, this is the last test. The test of ability and courage. Let's go, throw it. Have mercy, Piconzé. I'm an only child. My dad, my mom! Bravo! Great! You did it. This is yours. You can now defend yourself. Good luck! How great. Thank you. Now we can defend ourselves. [Bird and Pig:] He deserves it, he deserves it! Do y- you need he- help? And don't forget it, my son. Only use my teachings for the good. Goodbye, thank you! The victory will be ours! We'll win the fight! Agreed? We also have to do something! [Inaudible] Piconzé learned how to fight and he got strong! Strength by itself won't cut it, astuteness is also necessary. [Inaudible] Poor Maria. I wouldn't want to be in her place Chicão? What's happening? I'll go change my clothes in a bit. I had an idea. Go get me one of Maria's dresses so I can wear it! For what? - You're insane. I'm not insane, I know what I'm doing! Those thugs are, naturally, interested in girls. We'll set a trap for them. [Inaudible] You look like a doll. - May God be with you. How do I look? - Be careful, my son. Piconzé, there's something missing. What is that? [Inaudible] Now you look nice. Piconzé. They'll never know. Pretty boy! Pretty boy! Wow! Come here. Am I dreaming? This reminds me of my Paris days. What a voice! Am I speaking with Roberto Carlos? Where did you come from and what are you doing? Do I know you from anywhere? If I have booze, will you drink it? This will make a nice lemonade for the Captain. Captain! Oh, Captain! I'm not deaf! Who's the girl? She's selling water that a bird can't drink. It's a nice recipe. Yellow. Buy? Me? I've seen this face somewhere before. Your mustache is getting more and more beautiful. They fell for it so easily. I couldn't stand there. I came to help you. We need to get the girls that are trapped in the back. Go! What's that noise? Women, I'm here! - Chicão! Now follow after me. - Let's go girls. How nice! How nice! Hooray! We're going home! Maria! Is everything ok? Let's go! Attention, passengers. The group is leaving. At last! My hero! Chicão, help us here! I'll tell you when to go. Let's go. Let's get out of here. At full gallop, Chicão! Don't leave me here alone! I'm an only child! Don't do that! Go see what's happening! Captain, that little kid took the girls! Captain! Guard! I think that girl took the horses. Go get the goats. Go! Now Bigodão will attack! Maria, my dear. Thank God. Did you see it, Grandpa? It was Piconzé. [Bird and Pig:] I would like to seen their faces! But the thugs will be back, for sure! So, we have to get ready to go against them! Gather everyone. Even the Village women! - We need to start preparing! - But we don't have any guns. - How are we going to fight? - I'm willing to do it. Attention! I have a great idea! Think about it with me. How? I'm already messed in the head. Get it together! Here. Her. And here. We'll put mines. Here a cannon. The tank will be hidden next to the church. And we'll need a lot of grenades. A cannon? Where do we have that? Shut up. This is what we were able to get. Is it good? Barbarity! This is going to give a lot of work! Attention! They're here! Are they here already? - No, it was just a test. What a scare! Attention! Careful! The thugs are attacking! And this time it's for real! Get ready! Turtle, don't get scared, I'm here! Confirmed! The thugs are coming! It's time, Maria. Help the women. How stupid! They fell right into the trap! Call the priest, I'm dying! They coming from the river! What's happening? They're reacting? Retreat! They're running away! We've won, we've won! Don't go away! Come back, you cowards! They really are coming back! Attack! Cannon! Shoot! Attention! Fire! [Inaudible] Fire! Now! Let's go, gang! Let's go! Piconzé rocks! Oh, but I'm still scared. Women! Bring water to put the fire out! Water! More water! Help! [Inaudible] You brat! Bring the tank! Where did you put the tank?! Chicão, come with me! Piconzé is calling! Let's go! We're coming, Piconzé! We're coming! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Hey, what's happening here? Bigodão, Bigodão is escaping! Oh, you brat! How dare you challenge Bigodão, the King of the Thugs! You'll pay for this! It's no use! You can't beat me! Let's go, brat. Start praying! Let's go, pray! Pray! Go help, Chicão. There's no use. You'll get in here over my dead body! Well, then, let's see! Piconzé! Let go of Maria, you coward. And come fight like a man! Back off. Back off or she'll die! And now what? Hey, Turtle is up there! You two over there, get out of my face or she dies! We need to get Bigodão's attention! Let's go! Get out of my face! What now, you bastard? - He- he- he- help me, Ma- maria! - There you go, Turtle! Well, Sir? Me? What happened to my boys? You win, Piconzé! What a beautiful morning! Let's work, people. Everyone up! Let's work! Bigodão, regenerated, is here and apologizes! With your permission. Let's go everybody. Straight to work! How nice, they're working and are no longer our enemies. Piconzé, you're a sweetheart. - I want to be the best man. Yeah, I think I was right. These two, I don't know. With God's help, there will be peace and love in our lives! ♪ In the Green Valley Village! ♪ The end.
