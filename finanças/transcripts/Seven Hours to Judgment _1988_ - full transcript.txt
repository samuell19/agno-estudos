No! Aah! No! No! No! Aah! Aah! Love you. Hey, if you ran like that in a 100mt relay, you guys must have lost all your meets. Come on! What? Come on! Answer my question! Come on! Answer my question! What question's that? The one the Daily News was asking us today. Oh, that question. No comment. Heh. You're funny. If you're gonna run for public office, let me know. I can raise the rates. Make a campaign contribution. Hey, you raise your rates any more, Sigmund Freud is gonna rise from his grave. No, no, he wouldn't. I'm cutting him in for 10%. Where are you going? You go on. I'm waiting for my lungs. They'll be along any minute. Come on, come on. Where's the old Harvard spirit, the old do or die? Come on! Kiss my Harvard ring. See you tonight. If I live. Good morning, this is Joan Lockhart. As we go into our second day of record-high temperatures in the city, the big story continues to be the gang violence hearing today in the third district court, where Judge John Langford Eden III is the presiding judge. -Look where you're going. -Sorry, Judge. David Reardon, eccentric electronics genius and owner of a national chain of audio/visual stores, is the husband of the alleged victim in this case. Also this morning, a fire broke out downtown in the federal building. Luckily no one was injured, and the cause of the fire is still under investigation. This has been Joan Lockhart withNewsbreak. Okay, get ready. Good one. Hey, guys. Hit me with a pass. Touchdown! Hey, get us a cone. Hey, young fella. It's a nice day, isn't it? I want a... I want a sundae. All right. Take care now. Bye. Be careful. Without knowledge of the ethics of the negotiation, it is difficult to tell when we can expect an answer. Most likely, new information will be available by next week. Jody, what do you have for us? Thousands turned out for yesterday's anti-nuclear demonstration, which ended at the steps of the mayor's mansion. Three people were detained for minor infractions, but generally the crowd was well-behaved. Gang violence has erupted once again on the south side. Four members of the notorious Icemen street gang stand accused in last week's brutal subway attack. Hearing the case is Judge John Langford Eden III. Oh, please, not in my own home! At least they spelled your name right. ...a year ago for lack of evidence. What time did you get up, anyway? I don't know. Early. ...Eden has been considered a likely nominee for the upcoming senate race, but insiders are now saying that the outcome of today's hearing may determine the fate of Eden's political career. Hey, what's wrong? ...has promised a no-nonsense approach. Talk to me. I saw one of them a second ago outside the house. One of who? One of that, uh, gang-- One of the Icemen. What was... What was he doing? He was just standing there staring at me. It's supposed to be their MO. You know, whenever one of them is on trial, the others loiter around the homes of everyone involved, uh, to intimidate them. And then the witnesses develop convenient cases of amnesia. I don't understand this. I mean, uh... You're the judge, not a witness. Why would they harass you? Well, maybe they don't make that distinction. Well, I just hope the DA has some hard evidence, so you can lock 'em up for good this time. Oh, do you? Okay. Wait a minute. Come here. What? I'm sorry. I'm due on the bench. First I want you to preside over my bench. Why should I? 'Cause I think you could use... A complete aerobic workout. I love you. I love you, too. Mrs. Ellen Reardon, victim, remains in critical condition in the intensive care ward at State Hospital, where she's been in a coma since the alleged attack. Mrs. Reardon's husband David is better known to us as Ravin' Reardon, proprietor of the well-known chain of audio/video stores. It's Ravin' Reardon time! Yee-haw! I'm smashing prices! I'm slashing to the bone! That's right, folks! We've got VCRs, portable cameras, CDs, and racks to hold them all! We've got cable switches for you! We've got junction boxes for you... For a complete system, which I'm sure you need! And, you ready, folks? ♪ With prices so low ♪ That you know Why they call me ♪ ♪ Rr-rr-rr-rr-rr ♪ Ravin' ♪ Reardon! And remember, folks, we've got six locations, and we accept all major credit cards! With prices so low, that's-- Strange, isn't it, how a man can seem mentally incompetent and still thrive in his profession. Mr. Reardon. How may I help you? Nice to meet you, sir. I'm sorry if I'm intruding, Your Honor, and please forgive my appearance. I've been at the hospital all night with my wife. I didn't have a chance to shave or anything. I'm sorry. Please. Sir, you got to postpone this hearing. I can't talk to you about the case. I was contacted last night by someone who swears those punks deliberately tried to kill my wife. You have to give me time to speak to the man. I can't get involved. Have you given this information to the police? I'm running out of time, sir. That's why I came to you. You'll have to take this up with the district attorney. Sir, I'm supposed to meet this guy tonight from Spanish Town with the Grand Ds. He's got proof. He has solid proof, sir. Mr. Reardon, the Grand Ds and the Icemen are rivals. Now, most likely they're trying to set you up for a con. I think a much better approach is to-- Your Honor, I've been a salesman all my life. I know the difference between a snow job and the real thing. Mr. Reardon, I'm due in court. Now, if the evidence is sufficient, they'll go to trial. Sir, I just told you where the evidence is. Yeah. Mr. Reardon, when the evidence is before me I will consider it. Now, please, if you'll excuse me. Thank you. Let me ask you something. Why did you put them out on the streets last time? They were juveniles, Mr. Reardon. The laws in this state give me very few options in those circumstances. This time, they are being tried as adults. It's out of my hands now. No, you've done enough. You and your easy laws have turned this city into a hellhole for decent people, but how would you know? You don't even live in it. You look at it through your tinted... Fucking limousine window! Ready, Your Honor? Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry. I understand. We, uh... Thirty years. You know, my mind-- No, no. I just... I gotta get back and take care of my wife. Would you please forgive me, sir? Defense is attempting to characterize her clients in a brazenly sympathetic fashion. Objection. Objection! But-- All right, all right, please. Mr. Kaplan is attempting to-- I want this stopped! Please, if I may get a word in edgewise. Whatever. The witness will answer the question. I could see him... Not every second, but I could see him. Officer... I submit that you could barely see at all. I further submit that what you saw was not my client attempting to push Mrs. Reardon off the subway platform, but was, in fact, their attempt to save her from a terrible accident when she lost her balance. Then where's her purse at? Scattered along 20 miles of subway track. Objection. Objection. This is not the time for a speculative argument. Would Your Honor please admonish Ms. McKay to stop grandstanding and get on with her cross-examination? Sustained. Allow me to rephrase. Please. Mr. Wilton... Is it possible that the struggle you claimed to have witnessed was actually a rescue attempt? I mean, wouldn't the screams and the cries and the flailing arms and legs be the same in both circumstances? Objection. That question calls for an assumption on the part of the witness. Overruled. All right, judge! Yeah! Sit down, man. Officer? The witness will answer the question. You'll be all right, son. Well, yeah, it could look the same, but that doesn't mean that they didn't do it. No further questions. Counsel will approach the bench. Mr. Kaplan, have you pursued all possible leads? Whatever witnesses there are live in the same neighborhood as Ms. McKay's four little animals over there, so naturally, they had an immediate strong attack of memory loss. Have you questioned members of the other gang, the Grand Ds? Your Honor, I have touched on all the bases. Thank you. Witness may step down. The attention that this case has attracted from both the local and national media has been mentioned several times in this court, but notoriety and the harsh light of spectacle cannot alter the stringent demands of the rules of evidence. The defendants are well-known to this court, more than that, I cannot say, except that I make this decision with great reluctance. The prosecution has not met its burden in establishing sufficient evidence to bring the defendants to trial for the crimes of robbery and attempted murder. Case dismissed. McKay, thank you so much for... For what you did. Fuck this bitch! Fuck you. Fuck you! What are you doing? You go to school all your life to learn how to take people's money? What do you think you are? Huh? Get out of my face! Hey! Come on. There's no justice in your game! Come on. Take it easy, boy. Watch your attitude. Sorry about that. Be cool, be cool. I'm innocent. That's right. Ain't that right, Judge? I can't believe Laura. She's getting her eyes tucked this time. She's gonna look 12 years old. Gayle, you're awful. Ooh, look at this dress. Beautiful. Oh, someone stop me before I shop again. You want to share a cab? There is this great-- I can't, I can't. I'm meeting John at the club tonight. I've gotta get home and change. Well, Monday, then. Remember, you owe me a can of tennis balls. Make it two weeks from Monday. We're going to Palm Springs tonight after the party. Well, have a great time. And don't get burned anyplace I wouldn't. Very funny. Oh, my God. There is my cab. See you later. Can I have the Daily Tribune,please? Thank you. Oh, hello. Hi. How are you? How are you? Good evening. Hi, there. How are you? Hey. Oh, there you are, you son of a gun. Heh heh. Ooh, look at that. See that? Good evening. Hi, Colonel. How are you? Hi. Penny for your thoughts. I thought it was $100 an hour for my thoughts. Oh, well, this is a more special evening rate. You look like a man with a problem. My wife's an hour late. That's not a problem. That's normal. Besides that, if Lisa were my wife, I'd wait for her at least two hours. Come on, John. Give. Oh, I used to love my job. And you don't now? I thought I was part of some ancient and proud tradition from the Code of Hammurabi to the Magna Carta to the US Constitution. I was an invisible wall between barbarism and civilization. Now I read the editorials in the newspapers, and I get enraged... And they're about me. Today in the courtroom, John, you did what you had to do. It was not your fault. The district attorney didn't have a case. It doesn't make it right. It doesn't make it any easier to sleep. -Now, suppose... -What? Suppose I had a patient who, uh... Was telling me all kinds of things about murder and mayhem. I mean, this could be just an average citizen with a little problem, or he could be Jack the Ripper. -Exactly. -So, what do I do? Do I violate my personal code of ethics by turning him in to the police just because he told me his evil thoughts? What do you do? Well, how the hell would I know? I wasn't even thinking about it until you brought it up. I think I'm gonna get some food. You're beginning to make me clinically depressed. Care for a drink, sir? Thank you very much. Don't say a word, Your Honor. Just do what I tell you to do. we're leaving now. Let's go. I said, let's go. This way. Easy does it. Easy does it. Let's go. John? Don't turn around. Let's go. Easy. You can't possibly get away with this! Ah, you're crazy! I said get in! Ira, that's enough! Enough! Put him over here. Over here. My job... Is to protect Mr. Reardon. He's fine, Ira. Aren't you, Judge? Are you fine? He's fine. You're full of surprises. Not as deadly as your gavel, though, is it? I can understand why you're upset. He understands, Ira. He understands, you hear that? He understands. As you can see, Ira is very simpatico. Wait next door, Ira, please. Thank you. Mr. Reardon, you may not realize it, but you've already committed assault with a deadly weapon, battery, kidnapping. But if you'll put that weapon down right now and go with me to the police, I promise I'll do everything within my power to help you. You see, I know now that there are extenuating circumstances. Obviously, you're distraught since your wife's death. Any jury could understand that. You are a riot, Judge. Even when you're lookin' into your own grave, you're an incorrigible bleeding heart. you'd recommend leniency for your own execution. That's touching. You want to know who's really guilty here? You. You. Of malfeasance in office, incompetence, dereliction of duty, and above all, coddling the scum of this city. You deserve death. But I'm gonna give you a suspended sentence. "El Pollo Dorado"? It's a bar on D Street. You'll know it when you see it. And I know, I know. For a man like you, it might as well be on Mars. What's there? You do remember the Grand Ds, don't you? That gang I told you had the evidence that would've punished my wife's murderers? The evidence you said didn't exist? Well, I know it's for real. Now you're gonna go out and pick it up. Now, here's your ticket. Us common folk call it a subway token. Listen to me. You've got seven hours to go out and get that evidence and bring it back here. Seven hours. It's... Just before midnight. What the hell. For three minutes, I'll be a sport. You have until 7:00 a.m. This is insanity! No, the sanest thing I have ever done. I played by your rules all my life. Now my wife is... Her murderers are loose in the street. That's insanity! But here and now, I'm the judge... And you'll play by my rules. Let me hire a private investigator. I'll pay for everything. Very considerate of you. It's a little late. Come over here. I said, come over here. I was just finishing when you interrupted me, okay? Look over there. Here you go. There. Lisa! You sick bastard! Relax, Your Honor. She's comfortable. Look. Look! We gave her a little something to calm her nerves. Listen to me. If you want to save your wife, you're gonna need a cool head and a lot of luck. What do you mean? Your keen legal mind hasn't figured this out? If you don't go and get that evidence for me, she dies. You've got six hours and 56 minutes left. Reardon, you gotta listen to me. You gotta listen to reason! Now, why is it that I'm getting this feeling of deja-vu? Could it be that you and I were once together just like this, only I was the one that was begging for his wife? What did you say? You said, "it's out of my hands." Well, it's in my hands now, and I sentence you to spend seven hours in the city you made, or your wife dies. You just wasted 30 seconds, Your Honor. There is a way out in that room you just came from. I suggest you use it. Tick-tock, tick-tock! Oh. Well, I should've expected this! He still thinks the same way he does in court. Lisa! ...the easy solution. There's so much arrogance there! Lisa! He is morally and intellectually superior to me... Lisa! And that a happy ending for both of you is just minutes away. Let it out! Lettin' it out, he plunges on, thinking that his adrenaline can compete with my rage. Hey! Don't you realize that I've planned ahead? 'Cause I know you're already breakin' the rules. Lisa! I know you're already lookin' for answers. Lisa! Let me help you. Tick-tick, tock-tock. Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. Tick-tick, tock-tock, tick-tick, tock-tock. Tick-tock, tick-tock! -Lisa! -Tick-tock! Tick-tock! Tick-tock! Tick-tock! There he goes. There he goes. You just wasted ten minutes, Your Honor. Ten minutes of your wife's life. She's not here, you see. She could be anywhere in the city, and you'd never find her, and just in case you're thinking along those lines, neither would the police. In six hours and 46 minutes, I'll have her brought here, and if you have the evidence, you'll be together. And if not... you'll die together. So, what do you say, Your Honor? Are you ready to take me seriously? You bastard. Tick-tock. You're a sick, crazy bastard. Tick-tock. All right. Remember... If you go to the police, they'll never find her, and you will make yourself a widower. So, I'll see you in six hours and 42 minutes, right here. Hey, baby, where are you going? Wait a minute! Come on! Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? You want to get yourself killed? I'm sorry. I've had a very rough evening. Where to, a dry cleaners? El Pollo Dorado. 1204 D Street. You want me to take you up to sleazeville at midnight? You can kiss my hack license. Out, pal. You can't refuse a fare! O-U-T. Out. I'll give you $50. Oh, yeah? Let's see it. Well? I don't have it on me. I'll give it to you by morning. Out, asshole. You gotta listen to me. No, you listen to this, pal. Oh, damn! Hand it over. I want it right now. Come on, give it to me. Amigo... I'm, uh... I'm here to see the Grand Ds. For, uh... For them. I have money for the Grand Ds. Through there. In the back. Gracias. You lie, you die, gringo. The Grand Ds... Do you know where they are? The Grand Ds? Gracias. You must be the Grand Ds. I'm not here to give you a bad time. Man, what a relief. I was so scared, I was ready to puke. Me llamoJudge Eden. Judge Eden? Reardon sent me. You know what I'm here for. I do, I do. Step into my office, hombre. Start talkin'! Reardon. Uh... He says that you contacted him with facts pertinent to his wife's-- Amigo! Fuckin' talk English, okay? Okay. Reardon... You know him, right? Uh, I want what you promised him. What is it? Um... Uh, evidence, some kind of proof? Sure, we got it, but we don't do no down payments. It's cash and carry! Yeah, but I... I don't have any money. Look, what about, uh... See? No credit cards. Don't fuck with us, hombre! I must've been robbed this evening. I didn't even know it happened. I didn't know it was gonna happen. I'm sorry. No, I'm not fucking with you. Subway token. That's all he got. One fuckin' subway token! I told you, I was robbed this evening. I didn't even know it happened. I'm sorry. Uhh! Fuck! You're gonna know it. You're gonna know it for a week. Okay. Oh, shit. -Tu chica? -Yeah. Muy hermosa. Maybe you set us up with her, no? That's my wife. My wife, she's in trouble. I need to help her. Look, this jacket. It's worth $400. Here, take it. It's yours. This, uh... this ring. Harvard. 1975! It's solid gold! Take it, it's yours. Take anything you want. Just... Just give me the information! Fine! You want information? Why don't you just-- Give me that watch. The watch, too. You got it, you got it. Oh, this look good, too. Yeah, take it. But I need a watch. El cheapo. All yours. Just take whatever you want, but I want you to give me that fuckin' information! -You want information? -Yes! -Information? -Yeah. This is a good-looking woman. I don't know what a good-looking woman is doing with an ugly fuck like you. But okay. The guy you are looking for named Eddie. He's up there on 16th and Pike, northeast corner. You were supposed to have the information. Hey, man. This guy don't like the way we do business. Man, Eddie's up there on Pike. You take it or leave it, hombre! Or maybe we take you, huh? Hey, I'm gonna need that subway token. Subway token? Yeah, you give it to me right now. -You wantyour subway token? -Uh-huh. I'll give you the fuckin' subway token. There's your fuckin' subway token. Eat it! Wait up, wait up. Hello. -Ow! -Oh, Danny, listen. You're home. I, uh... You won't believe it. I need... Oh, shit. Listen, I need... Lisa. Now, where are you? What happened to Lisa? She... I got to go. What's wrong? I better get over there. Do you want me to wait? No. No, no, no. He seemed pretty upset, and I just might take a while. You must be the only shrink in the city that makes house calls. I've known this guy for 20 years. Otherwise, I would not violate my professional ethic with a personal touch. Hey, hey. Hey! What are you doing, man? Hey! John? Lisa? Anybody home? Sorry. John? "Alaska Airlines, flight 110, Palm Springs." "Arrive 6:30." Who are you? David Reardon. The Edens are out for the evening. They asked me to pick something up for them. Do you know where they are? Yeah. I believe I do. Can you take me to them? Sure. After you. Judge Eden! Your Honor. Hey, that's off-limits. Judge Eden! Hey, what the hell you doing, man? -Come on. -He in here? There he is. Wait, wait, wait. Here, this way. You see him? You see him? You go this way. Huh? Hey, what the hell are you doing? What are you doing down here? You don't belong down here. This is where I live. No. Ah! No! No! Let go of me, you bastard! Mr. Reardon says you can't go nowhere. Reardon? Did you say Reardon? I'm working for him now for three years, and he calls me my name. What is your name? Ira. Ira Martin. I'm Lisa. Ira, please... Please let me go home. I'm protecting you. That's what Mr. Reardon said. Oh, no! Let go, let go! Ira... I know you're trying to do a good job for Mr. Reardon, but you don't understand. He's lied to you. He's taking advantage of you, Ira. He's a dangerous man, Ira. He is a criminal. Don't you understand? He's a criminal! Don't say that. He gave me a job. He's a good person, isn't he? Isn't he? Yes! He's a good person. Hey, look at that light! Give me that, boy! Boy's kind of riled up, ain't he? Hey, she don't do that to everybody, you know. Give this man some wine. A sweetie, though, ain't he? Hey, give us some tongue, handsome. Ew! No! He must've run into some ghoulies down there. Did you see some ghoulies, boy? He was down there seeing his parents, weren't you, boy? Always did want me some pants like these. What part of town am I... Where am I? Where is this? We call this hell. Working folks calls it skid row, near Francis and Third. Then I went south. I went the wrong fucking way. Wrong way! Hey, wait, come back. Hey, boy, where you going? Baby, come here. You want to pet it? Thanks. You know, I love birds, too. Do you have any pets? Once I did. But she died. You know, I have a dog. I'll bet he'd really like you, too. You think so? Yeah. Oh. Except for, I was supposed to feed him hours ago. The poor guy must be starving. Why don't we go to my house? And I could feed the dog, and you could play with him at the same time. Mr. Reardon says I'm supposed to protect you. Mr. Reardon wouldn't mind. You could protect me at my house and play with the dog. Come on. Come on, let's do it. Hi, Mr. Reardon. We were just going to go feed the dog. Shh. You don't have to be concerned. I just came back from Mrs. Eden's house. I gave the dog his dinner. That is a lie! You don't believe me? That's hardly fair, Mrs. Eden. Ira believed you. Perhaps you'd like some proof. Here's your address book and your diary-- Give me those! You have some interesting dreams, Lisa. Or should I say Lily? Give me those! Bastard! Interesting friends, too. Powerful friends. Senators, judges, the governor... The ones that turned this city over to the animals. I'm going to make a list, invite all your friends to a party and give them a taste of reality. My reality. Ira, take her downstairs. Hey. Hey. Hey, you. Hey, come here. Hello! Is anybody home? Hello! Who are you? Are you Eddie? Who's asking? Reardon sent me. Reardon, huh? About time you showed up. He said you had something for me. Yeah. Here it is. Just like when Chino and the Icemen laid it on me. Patent leather, credit cards... And all of it full of nice, neat fingerprints of Chino and the boys. Mind your hands. Don't smear it. Yeah, those boys must've thought I was stupid or something. That whole story about the woman they jumped was already on the news when they was in here trying to sell me her credit cards, so I figured I'd do my part as a citizen. Especially when it can be so rewarding. Speaking of which... What? The money. $1,000. $1,000? Don't get dumb on me, friend. I told Reardon that was the price. Now, you got it or not? Now you listen to me. I'm an officer of the courts of this city. That is critical evidence, and I'm empowered to take it. Now, you turn it over right now, or you'll be charged with obstruction of justice, withholding evidence, extortion, conspiracy, or anything else I can think of! Oh, damn, you sure can talk. Me, I'm a man of few words. Now give it back! I'm trying to save my wife, damn it! I'm running out of time! Yeah, well, we all got problems. Give it back! Damn it! Hey, come on back, mister. Okay, we both lost our tempers. It happens, but, come on, it's just business, huh? Look, I'm going to put the gun down, and we can talk, okay? Get up! I find you guilty as charged. The fine is... $15. Case dismissed. Hey. Hey! Hey, Your Honor! Over here! That-a-boy. Outstanding job, but you got less than an hour left, and that's not much time to travel a hundred blocks. Bastard. You'll have to hurry to beat the traffic. -Lisa! -You'll have to hurry to beat the clock. Tick-tock, tick-tock. This is no place for boys. Chino, we've been up all night. Let's go home. We'll go home in a little while, and we sure ain't going to sleep. Stand back. Yo. Yeah, he's here. Who wants to know? Close personal friend, my ass. Hold on. Yo, Chino, telephone. I'm busy. The man say he got to talk to you, though. What man? Man, this homeboy's serious. Is he? Keep your hands off my balls. Yeah. Hello, Chino? Who is this? Let's just say that our paths have crossed in a cosmic kind of way. What are you talking about? I'm talking about keeping you and your friends out of prison. You do remember that woman in the subway, don't you? The woman you murdered? I didn't murder nobody. If you don't believe me, ask the judge. Well, that same judge is walking down Roosevelt Avenue right now, and he's carrying the victim's purse. You know what's in that purse, Chino? Her credit cards. You know what that person's credit cards can do to you, kid? It can send your ass right to hell. Hell is everywhere. Why don't you take a look for yourself? He's heading for the 18th Street subway station right now. Come on, Chino, a bet is a bet. Come on, man. Now, we got to go. The bet is on, and everybody's watching. Where you going? Come on, man. Come get on some of this. Get on some of this, man. This is all you. Come on, get some of this. Oh, no, I see. He's in love. -Where you going? -We got trouble. Go. Go. Hurry! Wait! What happened? Huh? It happens all the time, buddy. What happened? There we are. You got something that we want. Cut him, Doctor, cut him! -Bitch killed Doc! -Now listen to me! Let's get out of here now! Come on! You understand? Move! Move! Come on! Come on. Hey! What? Hey! 728 Orson Street! Hurry! Asshole. All right, that's it. Once is enough. Can't you go any faster? I ain't got wings. Relax, we'll be there in ten minutes. All right, all right! Come on, baby, we got him. I got him, man. I got him, I got him. Got him. I got him. What the fuck? What the hell are you doing? Man, I got him, man. I got him, I got him. Let's kick ass! We'll be all right! Come on, man, take my card. I got a machine. It's on all the time. It's going to blow! Here. Let the game begin. Lily. It's you, Lily. I wish you could see this. Here he comes. Oh, prompt. Right on time. So eager to join you. And you won't be alone, because soon I'll be inviting all your friends. All these important people. I'll be inviting them all to the real world. Well done, Your Honor. Well done. Ira... Go down and welcome our guests. Move this guy. Huh? I hope you found your evening in the real world educational. We're waiting, your wife and I. We're waiting upstairs. That's it... Upstairs. Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't like that? Come on. It's just a little jolt, nothing fatal. Hey, maybe if you're quick enough, you can make it to the top before I fry you. Ah, he loves his pipes. Excellent! Well played, Your Honor. This was the only route to the first floor loft. The elevator. You see, I'm going to try to leave you at least one safe route to your wife, just to be fair. Don't you agree? Please do not fiddle with the elevator roof, sir. It is private property. I would not dare venture any further than the first stop if I were you. Hello. This is the first floor loft. Bath notions, lingerie, perfume, ladies hats and gloves. Step lively. Step lively, sir. Out you go. We are a busy store. Or step to the rear of the... No, no, no... I said do not dare venture further than the first stop. You won't listen. You will not trust. Okay. Okay. Don't be a jerk. Here, I'll even show you. See, I'll give you a little clue every once in a while, okay? Now you better push the down button. I say push the down button. Never mind. Oh, welcome back to the first floor loft. So, we... I asked you not to fiddle with the elevator, sir. Private property. Step lively, sir. Step lively. Welcome back. Bath notions, perfume, lingerie, ladies hats and gloves. Don't be shy. Sail ahead. You see? Yeah. You can trust me. Yes, you can. Go ahead. Go for it. I would never do the same thing twice, believe me. Come on. Trust. Trust. Trust. Ah, you're almost there, Your Honor. You had your night in the depths. Now you're climbing to the heights. Ira! Ira, get up here! Here. Hold on. Okay, hold on, hold on. Okay. Come on, baby. Hold on. We got it. Shit! This way. Wait! This way. All this bloodshed... Give me the bag. I ain't going to hurt you. Oh, God. Why? I got what you asked for. You can put the gun down, Reardon. Mr. Reardon, please! You see? You see? You see a woman begging? You see a woman begging? My wife begged, remember? I begged! Did you listen? No! No! No! Oh, God! No!
