It's another new hopeful morning today. Welcome to 'The FM Morning Show' - This year is almost over. - New hopeful morning? Cold winter weather's no reason to be a couch potato. Now it's time to get up, open the window, and feel the fresh morning air. Yeah... I love this freshness. Here's 'The FM Morning Show' bringing it fresh like the morning air. Why again? Do it quietly, if you want to die so bad. At your uncle's hospital? This is so humiliating. Humiliating? Then, take me to a different hospital. I'll die quietly there. Don't do this to me. You want to see me pass out from high blood pressure? What's wrong this time? Over and over again... You keep coming back alive. Isn't it all just an act? You're not a child anymore trying to get attention. Because you won't die. I'm trying to do it for you instead, OK? You spoiled brat. How could you do this to me? I gave up the piano and even my life for you, you brat! Ma, stop. Stop... - Yu-jeong! - I didn't ask you to have me. - Did I? - What the... - So, why don't you let me just die? - Yu-jeong, please! Ma, go outside for a minute. Uncle, please take Yu-jeong. Yu-jeong. I think you'd better cry... Ahh! You're huring me, Aunty! You always find bad things to do. What's this? You humiliate me! You haven't changed a bit. I got older, didn't I? You're not old enough to die. It's not like I really wanted to die. Just that this fat sun scares the hell out of me. You're not nagging? What, did you finally give up on me? ' - How's your mom? - Same'ol same'ol. She still sucks? I just saw your uncle He says you should be in the hospital for a month. So I demanded they let me take and use you. You prefer counseling or singing the national anthem? Anthem? What anthem? There's someone... ...who wants to hear your anthem. I can't believe someone wants to see a fool like you. You mean, my anthem? Seoul Detention House I thought you couldn't make it? Sorry, I'm a little late. It's an honor to meet you. You looked like an angel at the singing competition I'm not surprised you're doing a good deed, too. Actually, she dragged me here. I see. - Sister, Monica! - Hey, look at you. - How have you been? - Fine, but you, what happened? You got so skinner. I heard Father Kim underwent cancer surgery. Right. Prisoners with red numbered stickers are called, 'Big Timers.' What a sacrifice! We call condemned criminal like that. I'll say nice things to God about you, So, feel free to eat outside food. - My sister came to see me. - Ok. - Let's go. - I'll write you a letter. - Have a good time with your sister. - Thanks. Don't stand there. Come on, have a seat. Sister, he's here. Welcome. You're Yun-soo. Nice to meet you, Yun-soo. I'm over 60, so I can call you Yun-Soo, right? I'm Sister Monica. Did you get my mail? Sit. Sit here. Come and sit, Yun-soo. Hey, officer Lee. I brought some bread, could you remove the cuffs? Sorry. That's not allowed Let's eat. Here. Eat. Help yourself. I got no kids, but I've been coming here for over 30 years. So I'm almost your mother. Mother? Don't ever visit me again and send any letters, either. - I'm not trying to be evangelical. - Don't you get it? I didn't want to come out. I'm only here to say this. Ok, I see what you mean. But it's not that uncomfortable to meet an old lady like me? I just want to spend some time with you once a week. I don't care if you're religious or not. Just meet and talk and look, eat something. Hey granny. Do that somewhere else. If you really wanna do something nice, then send a petition for my death. For my death! I hate... Every minute of this life. Yun-soo. What's tormenting you? What are you afraid of the most? Morning. - Hey, hold on. - Hey, hold on. I know this is illegal, Take these with you. And share them with other fellas. I know it's rare here. You think I'd die without this? I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. - My fault. - Shit... People like you always make me feel like shit, That's why I don't want to meet any nuns or priests. Ok. I know. I apologize. Try some of these though. Once you told me You wanted to meet the former singer Ms. Moon in person. She's Sister Monica's niece. Yun-soo! How could you laugh in a situation like this? He looks like a girl. How many people did he kill? - I don't know. - Why not? You're a member of religious committee. When you meet a person, do you immediately ask 'Have you ever killed anyone? Why? ' I just met him for the first time. That's all I know so far. Right. You're a nun. Exhorting people like him and me to repent and sob. That's what you do for a living. I forgot for a second See? Now you know. You guys are so alike You know I'm impulsive. I'm not doing this. I'm taking back my promise That I'll come here for a month.' Ok, Do whatever you want and keep looking like 'the saddest person on earth'. You just keep living like that if you like. Hey, look who's here. Kids here treat you well because you got a death sentence, don't they? But I'm different from those little shitheads. You scared, kiddo? Then, you better not mess with me. Hey kiddo. Think that you stepped in shit right before you die. See? He can't beat me. - Time's up! - Everybody gather up! - Let's get inside. - Yeah, let's go. Yun-soo, shall we? - Stupid jerk! - Get him out! 3987! You wanna go to hell, stupid!? Get him out. Hold him down! Jung Yun-soo The hostage arrested Jung Yun-soo raped and murdered 17 years old girl Professor, it says 'The End'. That's all for today. Excuse me. You were 20 min. Late and gave a twenty min. Lecture. If you go on like this I'll have to file a complaint. People get what they give, right? Professor! I was at a nearby district office. Let's have lunch. Do you still like Bibimbap? I didn't know prosecutors would have that much of time. There's memorial service for dad today, - did you forget? - How could I forget? Don't skip any more of family events! Event? You call Dad's memorial service an event? Mom's piano recital is. Sorry, you have lunch alone. I'm not hungry. Yu-jeong, Mom's much older now. So do you like her? Look, our joyful home Bright and holy heaven's holy people Thank you God for gathering us all together today and for sheltering us. We honor and praise thee, Forgive us for we are weak and of the flesh and are here for such a short period of time This we confess to you as we humbly ask for your pity. Please console us in our hour of need and grant us peace. Amen. Wow Prof. Moon, you can drink! So, what's up today? You always get away with after-work dinners. I didn't feel like going home. Good for us, then! What else do we get at home except wives' nagging? How about Karaoki, then? Karaoki, everyone? That's a great idea. I heard you used to be a popular singer. Wouldn't that be nice being part of the chairman's family, ex-famous singer, and art lecturer as a hobby? Prof. Park... Stop joking around like that. What, am I wrong? People like us should bust our asses till death. It seems unfair... Hey, Prof. Moon! So you want me to go there alone? Are you out of your mind? The Sister at Dae-jeon prison is sick. I should take care of the kids. What can I do? What is it you want from me, exactly? Why do you keep asking me to meet with him? Do you know what crime he's committed? Does his past matter that much? I don't wanna talk about it. You're not gonna break your promise, are you? Ok. I'll meet him, I'll. I'll ask him all sorts of Qs. Even the ones you wouldn't. Once we had a party, and I played this, in the middle of it I became so emotional I ran out. I feel the same right now just like back then. Yu-jeong's here. Go praying for the Lord first. - Take it easy. - Oh, My... - You're so busy? - I'll call you. - Let's have a meal. - Sir, Drink some. - Call me, often. - OK. Honey, look at her! Yu-jeong! Oh, My God. You must be starving, dad. What's she doing? - Get off of me! - Yu-chan! - Yu-cheol, take care of mom! - I'm leaving! I met Dad, so I'm leaving. - Get up. - How could you... Yu-jeong. Yu-jeong! Open the door! Yu-jeong! Sorry, Minseok. What are we gonna do about your new car? She must be out of her mind! That's alright. Cars can be fixed, but... She hasn't changed at all. Sir! You acted like you would never show up. But then, why are you here again? I was told a woman's waiting for me, not Sister Monica. You know... Do I look like a woman? Aren't you? Yes, you are. Hey, I read every article about you. Excuse me, you're not supposed to talk about crime or things related in here. I'm scared, sitting in front of you. When my aunt said we'd be coming to see you, I felt like shit. Shit, you're straightforward, I like that. Yes, I am. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. Ok. Let's start with the anthem! Which anthem do you remember me singing? You're not gonna tell me? Then I'm leaving. Wait! Ms, Moon, please. Why don't you have some bread while having a talk? Why do you keep visiting me? You said you felt like shit. Do you feel like shit cause I'm here? No, that's not what I said. But it sounds a little strange... Mr. Yun-soo Jung. No... In here I should call you 3987? Why do you want to die so bad? Is that how you feel for real? You're so weird. Why don't you tell me to pray to GOD and redeem myself like everybody else? You shouldn't think of anything else but dying in here. Otherwise, I'd go nuts. Why are you asking me these headaching questions? Let me tell you one thing. I'm the best person to tell a secret to. Why? Cause I'll keep that secret till death. That's funny. Now, what is it you wanted to tell me about? You wanted to see me. I need to know today. Why you wanted to see me... My little brother was... ...a huge fan of yours. He always said you were the best singer. Eun-soo, Come out when I say. Let's surprise her, OK? Ma! Yun-soo. Go back. My husband is a dog. He'll kill you, if he sees you. So, go back and stay at the care center! I'll come and look for you later, I promise! Give me a break, Yun-soo. I gotta live, too. Where do we sleep now? You can't sleep anywhere. I'm scared. Can't we go back to the care center? No, we can't. I'm cold. Sing the anthem for me brother. Is that the only song you know stupid? Yes, I am It gives me strength. Until the East Sea's waves are dry... Aunty, you're gonna hurt them. Hello? - Grandma. - Yes. - Grandma. - Why? After my daughter died like that I was going to smash it on the street. Instead I covered it with black cloth for a while. - You opened it. - I needed to talk to her. I wanted to ask her If I could tear him apart. I thought, If I hurt him more than he hurt my daughter, I could rest in peace in hell. If there's a God... Sister! I have a favor to ask. Go ahead. Let me meet him for once. Please, Sister! Before the law kills him. Nobody knows when these men will be executed... Thinking of his death makes me, feel good. But I know that's not right... Forgiving someone is not that easy. But God has taught us so, And you, too, told us, to forgive our enemies, as many times as they trespass against us. Right? Yun-soo. This is the mother, of the woman you killed. The housemaid's mother. She made some rice cakes for you. Yun-soo. It's not what you think. Come here. Please. Why? Why did you kill her? Why did you do it, you bastard? Why? You son of a bitch! Why my daughter, my penniless daughter. Why didn't you just take the money and let them live. They can't live forever anyway... Calm down. Take a seat, Ma'am. This is not working. Yun-soo, get up. Hold on. I'm sorry, officer. I'm sorry, Sister. I was not going to... I'm sorry, I am so sorry. I'm sorry... I am really sorry. I am sorry. I deserve to die. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. I am sorry... I heard you were an orphan. If I could have my daughter back by killing you, I'd rather be on death row for killing you a zillion times. But I can't do that. That's why I'm here. So that you could rest in peace, I forgive you. Frankly, I can't still wholeheartedly forgive you, But I'll visit you until I can. I am sorry... I can not visit you often because it's far and expensive. But I'll see you every New Year's and Thanksgiving day. Stay alive until that day comes. Make sure you do. Officer! Officer! - What' wrong? - Something's wrong with 3987. - What? - Go and check! 3987, what's wrong? Are you ok? Wake up 3987! I'm sorry, I am sorry. Sorry! Sorry. I am sorry... Happy New Year everyone, We're washing your feet to wash your sins away. Father Kim, did we just witness a miracle? A fish transforming to a human being is a magic, not a miracle. Becoming a different person is a miracle. Aren't you having a hard time? - Hello. - Yu-jeong, mom's sick, again. - Is this Yu-jeong? Let me talk to her. - Just a moment. - I don't wanna talk to her. - You'll come soon? I don't have any appetite. Bring some soup from Sam-Cheng-Gak on your way. - And... - You're in a suite, ma. I'm sure they provide good food there. There are people who eat their meals on the cold floor with handcuffs on. It's already been a week since the New Year began. Is there anyone out there who hasn't done greetings yet? Pick up a phone and give them a call. There's nothing like the excitement you get from an old friend's call. You know what I'm talking about? What a great day to be that old friend! Go ahead, make that call. You've got something right next to your lip... Where? It's really delicious. It must be expensive. Of course it's delicious. I bought it for my mom. She's in the hospital. She checks in to a hospital for everything-headaches, stomachaches... I came to see you because I didn't want to see her. Just looking at her gives me headaches and stomachaches. What? You think I'm too harsh? No. I complain about her all the time But I eat well, live rich with her money. I'm such a bitch, aren't I? You don't sound like a professor at all, though you are the first professor I've seen in person. I'm known more as a loser on campus. Me, too. They know me as 'Cuckoo'. Sorry to interrupt. People don't t notice it cause I'm not talkative but I am the biggest loser of all time, so count me in, too. You're so much more handsome when you smile. Wow! It's snowing. Isn't it time to have a real talk? Until the East Sea's waves are dry She has an awesome voice. The best anthem singer. I feel uplifted just listening to her. Hear this. A lot, huh? Wow we got a lot of money. I'll save lots of money and take you to the hospital soon. I'll get you whatever you want. Get me Nike shoes! Do you even know what Nike shoes are? Peeing! Wow! Awesome! Look at these, man! They are those guys. Blind assholes in Oh's District. Are you mad at me? Just go to sleep! You could go wherever you wanted without me. Yes, you're dame right! It's too cold for spring. I'm shivering. Could you sing the anthem for me? Shut up and go to bed! OK, good night! Get up, It's morning. Hurry up, you lazy ass! Eun-soo! Eun-soo! Is this a game? Huh? Wake up, Eun-soo! Wake up! Eun-soo... Eun-soo... Eun-soo... Such a weak, dumb ass! Are you crying? Yes, I am, Shit! I'm crying cause I feel bad I didn't die with him! I understand how you feel. Understand? What do you know? How would you know how fucked up my life has been? You told me you're afraid of sitting in front of me? What could I do with these on? People like you are more horrifying. You come in here with an angel mask and pretend to know everything, shed that disgusting tears for my death, shit! That's enough. Yun-soo, let's go. Why do you keep coming here? Let me just fucking die! Yun-soo, let's go. He's resisting food. So I sustained him with nutrient fluids. I don't know why he harasses himself and warders. A man on death row should behave himself. Gosh, time flies. I'm so happy to see everybody altogether. Congratulations, mother! Happy birthday! What's wrong with you? You've never cared about my b'day. I don't need your congratulations. Just don't get into any trouble. Why are you getting skinner? Order some more food, will ya? Don't forget about this Saturday! I'm not interested in a blind date! He's a doctor. When will you ever have this opportunity again? I don't want to get married. Is this for me? A girl's happiness lies in meeting a guy who sincerely loves her. Feel that kind of happiness, Stupid! Being loved? What does that look supposed to mean? Do you think you were loved? Dad didn't love you he was scared of you. Hey... - What are you talking about? - Yu-jeong! I'm so like dad, I can tell by his eyes. Do you know what the most terrible thing is whenever I wake up after failed suicides? Seeing your face, Ma. Being your daughter again is the most horrible thing. - Hey, lady! - Don't do this to me. I'm so sick of you Moon families. If I every break down because of high blood pressure It's all your fault! Get the hell out of here! - Ma, you ok? - Mother, wake up! Mom... Brother Operating Room She'll be fine after this surgery, right? They won't know how many blood vessels have burst until they open it up. It's not because of me, right? Don't worry. She's always had the problem. It has nothing to do with you. Right, it's not my fault. Ma, let's talk. I have a lot of things to tell you. What's up? It's not even Thursday. Don't look at me like that. I know I'm embarrassed. You said you could keep a secret till death? I needed someone to listen to me. I don't know... Maybe... I came here to talk... about something... It's so embarrassing. To put it in my real boring and cheesy way, I, Moon Yu-jeong, tried to commit suicide 3 times. I was raped, by my cousin, when I was 15. He had a wife, and a kid. Bastard! I got raped by my cousin. The end. It's nothing, right? This is my first time telling this corny story to anyone. I thought I would feel so miserable and pass out right after finishing this story. I'm perfectly fine. So say something, even if you don't have anything to say. Nah, I'm regretting this. Why did I even bring this up? Sorry. Why? Why are you sorry for me? Because of a guy like me... Blame it on me. Don't be silly. I had a hard time getting this off my chest. Why are You pretending to be cool? You cry-baby, where did that handsome face go? Ugly fool... - It's my seat. - Did you pee here? Sure, I did! Do you know what it's called? It's called thistle, really persistent. Cleaners pulled them out, but they just keep coming back. The more you step on them, the stronger they get. Thistle? I like the name. I feel sorry for the cleaners though. Even grass like thistle struggles to survive... How come are you so quiet these days? Are you tired of beating up people? Maybe I'm ready to go? Yun-soo, I heard they had the 'chamber' cleaned up. Who ever goes first Let's meet at a good place. Hey! Thistle! I had a snow fight today. It was my first time. I'm thinking about what I've done so far... and why there are so many things I haven't tried yet. Maybe it's because of that? I feel like this is the first winter I've ever had. It could be my last winter. I haven't done many things, or been to many places. It'll be Thursday in 2 days. You don't know how much I'm looking forward to Thursdays. I wish everyday is Thursday. And it's only my wishful thinking. Wow-it's cool. I can walk around here all day. It's the best gift ever in my life. Seriously! Maybe you'll pass out when I show you this? Am I being too nice? It doesn't seem fair. I cooked for the first time. This is rice, isn't it? I slept well that night, after a long time. Thanks, Yun-soo. I couldn't sleep at all that night... - Why not? - I felt weird. I never thought that rich people could be miserable and want to die, too. I never imagined, a beautiful girl like you, would want to die. They say, even one tiny thorn feels painful more than anything on earth when it's in you. Wow! Finish it. Don't leave anything! Can I be honest and tell you something? Sure. Anything! To be honest, these rolls are too salty. You are silly... You asked me... so silly. I don't deserve... to meet... someone and have fun. Why not? Do I deserve it then? My friend stabbed her with a knife, And I took, a ring off, of her finger. You feel horny? You wanna do her? Hey, she's so into you. Shut up. Where's your boss? - She's not here. - She's fucking hiding again. She owes me 3 days payment. Let her know I'm raising the interest rate. Hey, Yun-soo! So nice to see you, what are you doing here? I'm done for the day. Why don't we have a few drinks? - They're on me! - Next time. Later? Let's go. See you tomorrow. Make sure you tell your boss about the interest rate. Hey, Yun-soo! - Where's Yun-soo? - Oh, My... What's wrong with her? She has an ectopic pregnancy. It'll cost us at least 3M won. Give me that money back that I lent you. You know I got no money. Shit, it's fucking salty. I lent it to you over a year ago, you asshole! You have an appetite, huh? Don't do this. We are all friends. Do you know Tae-sun, right? He's got this geek... I can't do it with this hand. - Are you interested? - Crazy bastard. You know I promised to Min-ok I'd never do that again! What do we do then? I got no money and your wife's almost dead. Do it one last time. What else can you do? Why the long face, huh? You open the door, I'll do the rest. You better keep your word. I'll give you 3M plus 2M. Deal? This drives me crazy. Whoever's cheated me out of my money ended up crippled. So, pay me back right away! - Let's go. - What the hell! I don't have any place to sit! Damn it. Stop bullshitting and just come over to my house. I gotta go. - Ms, Hong! - Hey, what are you doing here? Yoon-su, we have plenty of time left. I'll give you all the money you need. How many times have I told you? Just relax, chill out, ok? Hong, nobody's cheated you before, right? ' They'll be all fucked up if they did. You remember that girl? She cheated me and so you sold her to an island, remember? How is she doing by the way? You think she's alive? Oh, please! - Cheers. - Yeah. - Yun-soo, cheers! - Drink! Try this, it's a real good whisky! - Here. - For me. Wow, you're a good drinker. I'm so fucked up. Yun-soo, Yun-soo. Take Hong to her room. Hey. Do something for me, will ya? I'm going crazy. What are you doing? I know your girlfriend is sick. I heard everything, I'll pay for it. So do something for me in return. I'm so lonely. Ma! Yun-soo, this is much better right? Shit! Calm down... Calm down! Yun-soo, all we need to do is get her stuff, right? Hey, do yourjob! Move! Move! Don't forget the knife! Do something, stupid! Why? Why did you say, you killed them by yourself? I thought they loved me. My friends, and the girl with my baby. I tried to trust people for the first time... All I wanted to do was die. Bullshit. Aren't you angry? I thought I deserved to die, no doubt. And life has been like hell. But I... want to live. I'm suggesting we only save his life, not release him. All they do is lying. Like you said, killing is wrong. But what about the government murdering people? That's not murder, it's execution. The execution of law. - Either way, it's murder. Homicide. - Let's stop here. I don't understand why you are obsessed with this case. If you have time to care about this, why aren't you caring for our mom? How old are you? Me? 15! - What? - Since that day, I've been 15! Yu-jeong, Wait... Yu-jeong! Did something really happen that day? Mom once mentioned that you got picked on. Okay. Stop. Tell me. Did something really happen that day? Now... ...you're curious? Am I crazy that I write a petition for him, huh? You're asking me to die for Yun-soo? Sure, I'll do it. Do you want me to ask my family to protest 'Don't Kill Yun-soo' in front of the court house? Or you want me to put on an ad that I should be killed first, not Yun-soo? You have a visitor! Is my sister here? Give me a minute. Let me wash my face real quick! Did both of ya come all the way just to tell me that? My lord who gives me real life Maybe I should quit. I can't do this anymore. It is like that when you first start it. Have some barbeque and forget it, man. It was my button that killed him It felt so disgusting when I pushed that button. I did it. I killed a man. Not you. Those bastards killed him! Sit! My wife went to see a fortune teller, The reason we haven't had a baby for over 10 years is because I have this crappy job. The fortune teller said our baby's afraid of coming out. What did I do wrong? Don't I have a right to be a father? It's good that he's gone, though I feel sorry for him. There won't be any executions for a while. Let's enjoy winter. Officer Lee! Yes? You think God will accept a jerk like me? Good job. Handsome girls & boys, let's go! I met Tae-sun. Sorry. I should've persuaded him more... No. Yu-jeong... Can I call you just Yu-jeong? I'm just happy when I think of Thursdays when you come see me. It's so good to be able to smile like this. Good things never disappear. I'll... die anyway, but... my life was not a total failure, right? What are you doing? No, nothing. Very nice. Girls like that. You like her, don't you? Do you like Ms. Moon? - No. - Hey, come on. I'm doing this simply as a token of my thanks... Somebody will be so happy. 'You asked me' 'what I wanted to do the most.' 'Lf I get to pick one thing, I want to go to see the ocean.' 'Would you like to come see the ocean with us? ' 'Lt's just 1 hour away from here by train.' They have no clue about me. From the address, they might have thought I'm a big boss in town. Would you... Do you want me to go with them? I'll do it for you as a favor. I knew you would say. That... So I made this... Let me see your hands. Wow. You're a true artist, not me. I haven't drawn a picture since I came back from abroad. I'm making 1 more for Sister Monica. My hand is cold... Are you bragging you have a warm heart? It's much warmer... My ears are also itching. Somebody's gossiping about you... I don't care, I feel just great nowadays... I can't go out, but I wish I could live on forever even inside these walls, writing letters... ...to kids. You will have a good news... Yun-soo, time's up. Damn, it goes so fast... And Yu-jeong, It's my birthday next week... Really? What do you want for your birthday gift? I'll think about it. Yu-jeong, Get me Nike Shoes! Jeong Yun-soo! Don't you call me Yu-jeong. I'm much older than you. Call me Sis, If I buy you that shoes. Alright? I'll think about that, too. There's no such thing as execution order... Good Morning! Hello? This is Lee. This doesn't taste right. Who made this? What are you doing? Come and sit. Ma, you're not dying right? Why are you doing this again? There's nothing I can do. That's why I'm here. To... forgive... you, Ma! Ma! Ma! - What is it? - Ma! Min-suk said there was something to tell me and asked me to come over to his room. But then... Ma, it hurts so much... I'm scared, ma. Shut up, stop crying! Don't be so silly. What the hell did you do to him? Ma, no... I didn't do anything wrong... Keep your mouth shut around your brothers! You should feel ashamed of yourself! Till my death, I was going to hate you. I hated you even more, than Jung Min-suk. But I'm here now, to forgive you. If there's a God, he would know killing myself is much easier than forgiving you. I wish, if I make this sacrifice, he will show me the miracle! Of saving his life. Ma. Don't die. It's ok you torment me... Just stay alive... 3987, Yun-soo Jeong, visitor! What day is it? It's not Thursday. I'm expecting no one. Don't tease me. Wow! That must be Yu-jeong. Now she's visiting anytime? Get yourself ready. Am I dying today? Shit.
