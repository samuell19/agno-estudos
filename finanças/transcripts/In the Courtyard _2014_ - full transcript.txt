The singer! The singer! Antoine, what's going on? I want to sleep. I want to sleep but I can't. For weeks now. It's hell. I understand, Ok. Insomnia's tough, it's a real drag. You have to go on. They've done the intro 10 times. They're starting to look dumb. Even when I manage to doze off, I dream I'm awake. Enough, Antoine! Cut the crap! They could cancel the tour! Get out there, say "Hi, Guingamp!" and get into it, Ok! IN THE COURTYARD I see that Mr Sagnier at Flying Pizza, your most recent employer, was worried about you. He found you solitary... And? Anxious... And? Bad for team spirit. So he didn't renew your contract. Got anything else? The usual: messenger, waiter... It's not easy without a specialization. I had a request for a janitor but the Job Centre's handling it. They want someone permanent. Where is it? A janitor where? An apartment building. Mail delivery, general maintenance... That would suit you. You'd have a place to live. I don't believe it. This isn't it... Why do I lose stuff? "Experienced", it says. So overdo it a bit. Say you've been a janitor for firms or retirement homes. Say you've always liked the convivial side of the job. Try to smile at the interview. Be motivated. Ru try. You must, Mr Le Garec. Is this important for you? Yes, it's imporiant. Clean, sleep and not think, I'd kill for that. Don't tell them that! Can you tell me the convivial bit again? I'll write it down. Got a pen? I have some Lyxanxia too. I'm sorry? For anxiety. I can give you Lyxanxia. Chrystelle has Lexomil if it can help. It's not strong but it works. That's kind but I have what I need. That's enough now! You can't keep crying! Stop it! We're there to help them. You make them think you're sacrificing yourself. Just think about it. Imagine what they've been through. Sorry. Since she retired, my wife's been doing a lot of volunteer work. When they finally get here, they have to face a barrage of tears. She's training a young woman who's a bit... sensitive. Calm down, make them wait, I'll be there in 2 hours. I volunteer with the union... where I used to work. Yes. I promise. When she bends over, it's coming to an end. All right. Yes, I promise. Yes! Please forgive me. Of course. We were talking about your past experience. Yes... Well... I've mostly worked in... in retirement homes. Excuse me again. Please, go ahead. I have plenty of time. I'm really sorry. Yes, Julie. No idea. Stop crying! It's absurd. Excuse me. Mathilde, give me 10 minutes with this guy without any calls. I think he's perfect. But he's lying all the time! Says who? - He's a bad liar too! He's not used to it. That's reassuring. And he's motivated. Hold on, Julie. You didn't want an outside manager so you see to it. I need your opinion. It's important. I just told you. I like him. I'm bowled over. He's kind, polite and timid. Wonderful. I've always... liked the convivial aspect of the job. Give me one sound reason to hire this guy. One rational argument. He's reassuring. Seeing people, being out and about... With others, I feel I can't pass if my hair's a mess. There, that's my opinion. First the meal tickets. Then accommodation. I've... always liked... the convivial side. Look... He's talking to himself. I like the convivial side. Good! He won't get bored. What is it? Excuse me. I banged your door by accident. I'm the new janitor. I'm really sorry. There was a stain here, hard to get rid of. I'll be more careful. But... - Yes? It's three in the morning. Will you always mop the floor this late? No, of course not. Forgive me. I was working and didn't see the time. I'm really sorry. I'll finish tomorrow. Good night. You're staying here? I'm not going in today. I didn't sleep a wink. There's paperwork to catch up on. It bothers me. We can do it later. Not doing it is what wears me out! See you later. Hello, Mr... Gasmi. You kids are crazy! That's dangerous! It hurts! It wasn't us. Sure! You're crazy! I'll tell your parents next time, you jerks! I'm Mr Maillard. 3rd floor. Serge told me about you. I wanted to say hello. How's it going? Are you managing? I guess. I'm just starting. That was a pear. A Pear? Oran apple... By the way, bikes can't be stored out here. Try to have a word with Mr Ragueneau, 2nd floor. I think they're his. All of them? - Yes. You'll talk to him? Me? You have to enforce the rules here. Yes, of course. Coming from you, it'll seem natural. If I go, I'll look like a jerk. Yes. I mean... No. Hello. Hi. Mr Maillard... on the 3rd floor sent me to ask you to clear your bikes away. Yes? About your bikes. Wanna buy one? No, your neighbour sent me to... Six-month full guarantee. I don't want a bike. Got a cigarette? A wheel for a pack. I don't need a wheel. I don't own a bike. You need a bike! Take your pick from the yard. I have to be going. - No sweat. Take your time. They're not moving. Not moving? - No. That jerk makes me want it. Serge... I threw a plum at the janitor today. I threw a plum at the janitor. From the 5th floor. I hit his shoulder. Why did you do that? He was annoying me. HOW'? He was wasting water in the yard. He was playing with the hose like a kid and I grabbed the first thing I could find. I could have hurt him. You have a short fuse lately. It could've been the nutcracker... You can kill a guy from the 5th floor with a nutcracker. That's true. Serge... Actually, it wasn't a plum. I threw a pear at him. It's silly because water is used again. It's recycled, right? Yes. 70 % is recycled. Hello, Antoine. Everything Ok? - Yes, thanks. It's still early days. You like to garden? - Not really. I just don't like old soil that's grey and dry, shrunken in the pot... It bothers me somehow. Really? Funny, I never noticed but... I don't like it either. It's like old pots left on graves. I never thought of that... Do you have all you need in your lodge? Yes, I'm fine. Because... I have lots of spare things. Loan... A coffee machine, say. I have a microwave. A good one. It grills... I'd like you to have them. All right. Are you Ok? Yes, I'm fine. Who's that? What's he doing here? Hello. Can I help you? Hello, hello. My name's Lev. Be not scared. I very big but I very kind. Sometimes I want be small. Not small... medium. But we must accept us. Fat, thin. Then try to improve. We can do diet, exercise... and always try to get better. Yes? No? Yes. I mean no... I don't know... Of course yes. I member of community Institute of Emissaries of Light. Uniform because I do security with my dog Jos at Porie de Montreuil mall. After work in morning, I visit people to talk about Institute. And offer books. Institute of what? Institute of Emissaries of Light. Very good books. Body-building for soul. Energy. Sorry but this place is off limits to door-to-door salesmen... You can put flyers in boxes? Hurry it up. You want book? No, no thanks. No body-building for soul? No thanks, that's kind. It'll keep it flabby. I can leave books in your lodge? - No. Oh, but please? But please! Look, I put pretty poster for publicity. I don't know... That make nice colourfor you! I come back in one week. If someone buy, you put money in box. I trust you. You have clear gaze. Honest. You don't steal me because you have good aura. "Since the 1990s, several beachings, mainly of beaked whales, coincided with naval exercises that used powerful sonars. The main culprits: low-frequency military sonars used to detect submarines and air cannons used for offshore oil prospection." Do you want the weather? It's not great. No, we'll stop with the whales. Goodbye, Mr Vigo. I left endives with ham on the kitchen table. Thank you. Enough suffering for one day. Shit... What's going on? What'? - What's going on? Nothing. I was thinking... Think I'm stupid? No, I... What's wrong? This cracks bothered me for days now. I wanted to mention it but it seemed so absurd. What's that look? It's 3 AM and you're standing on a dresser... with a kitchen knife. I made a mark to check the depth. Ok... Morning. Antoine... Here... This should be what you need. Deadbolt... And door. See you later. What's going on? What's that? Your husband asked me to paper over the crack in the wall. But why'? He thinks it can't be filled. I'm useless with masonry... You can't see it now! No, you can't see it. Nothing at all! It's there, under the paper. I don't believe this... I'm sorry, he said you wouldn't be back until around 6. He wanted to surprise you. He certainly has. Thank you. You're so pale... I have stomach ache. Cramps... No coffee then. Do you need something? Sure. What do you have? Some rosemary tea... I'll be Ok. Or fennel and liquorice. It'll pass, don't worry. I've been overdoing it lately. Take it easy all the same. This isn't Versailles. Thank you. Lots of papers... These are for Serge, these are mine and these are papers I read to MrVigo. The blind man on the 3rd floor. The poor man... I only read bad things. I can't help it. Reading them out loud is like a way of warding them off. If I stopped, it would be worse. Silly, isn't ii'? It's like praying, I suppose. Does that sound crazy? No crazier than praying. Fuck... THE JANITOR IS SICK THE JANITOR IS A BIT SICK Good morning. Hello. Feeling better? Yes, I'm fine now. I'm sorry. It happens. Mr Maillard was a bit put out. Thursday is glass day, see. Yes, he mentioned it. I'll take care of it. By the way, we forgot to talk about your salary. Yes. There won't be any surprises? No. No stock options? No. No golden parachutes? No. That's Ok anyway. Hello, Antoine. - Hello, MrGasmi. Have a nice day. Hello, Antoine. - Ma'am. Mathilde. Feeling better? Yes, I'm fine. I found this near the bins. It must be yours. Thank you. I have a problem. Could you come up for a minute? Would you like some tea? Or coffee? Yes... I wanted to move the paintings... and the paper was still damp. And it tore. I thought I saw some new cracks so I tried to check... Doesn't the big crack look even bigger? I used spray adhesive to paper over the crack. It's less strong but you can remove it more easily. If you're... worried... and want to look underneath. You peel it back and, before replacing it, spray a little adhesive. It's easy, like a Post-It. It's up to you. You know, if you're still a bit worried about that crack... Yes? See a specialist. A specialist? An architect or a planning guy at the city hall. There has to be someone. What? It's so simple. How did you think of that? My ex... always told me to see a specialist. Deladeuil, that's... No, staircase B. What's he up to now? Hello. I'm Antoine. The janitor. We met the other day. How's it going? Fine, it's still early days. They're selling them off. The recession... You'll leave it here? Yeah but I'm running out of space. Actually... Wanna buy one? It'd help. This one? - No thanks. I don't know if you remember but I asked you to move them. Yeah, vaguely. It's because Mr Maillard is a bit put out. What a jerk. This is my living. I'm self-employed. Where do I stock them otherwise? Sure... No stock, no sales. So how do I manage? Hold on... Hold on. It's cast iron! It's tougher at the bottom. No kidding. It's really heavy. I'm Ok. - Glad to hear that. Is that a Citi Bike? The others are lighter. Good. The real money-spinner... would be winter storage for bikes. From October to May. 5 euros a month. 200 bikes, that's 1.000 a month. Times 6... 6.000 euros! Where do you put them? 200 bikes need a lot of space. On rooftops. On top of buildings. With the recession, crazy shit will happen on roofs. Tents, huts, people fighting for space... I need to talk to the owners' committee. Anyhow... Get comfortable. I'll be back, ok? Have a chocolate finger... I'll be right back. Are you Ok? Yeah. I'm great. Just having a rest. Shit... You're the guy I shouldn't have met. That's not a nice thing to say. It's not nasty either. May I? Fuck... What a jerk. I don't believe it. Why did I do it'? Shit... Fuck! What a jerk. Pain in the ass. Shit. THE JANITOR ISN'T VERY WELL Hello. Are you Ok? - I'm fine. That's beer. I'm afraid I have a problem. I think a squatter has settled in the workshop. I hear noises at night. Mind taking a look? No, not at all. Who are they? They've been here 3 days. Construction experts. They'll finish tonight. No one informed me. Serge must have told you... door-to-door salesmen aren't allowed here. Yes, I know that. I received a flyer, see, from that cult... The Perpetual Light thing... Yes, I distributed them. A guy from the cult asked me to. Yes. Are you a member? - No. It's a free country... Yes, but I'm not a member. I saw a poster in your lodge. He left me books to sell. Really? You can read for free. No thanks. Antoine, please... Well'? Nothing. Your building is probably built on a stable pocket of clay whose density alters with the temperature. What about that crack? The building is old, shifts a little and the adjacent building applies pressure. Slight lateral pressure here. Causing the horizontal crack. Nothing to worry about? No, it would take a huge rise in the water level for the sewers to burst like in the 1910 floods with water seeping via the garage into the clay that would turn soft like a wet sponge... Hold on. It's not working. Here we go. Here... Seepage, with unlikely subsidence meaning the pressure from number 15 on pan of the building while resistance from the other two, the two built in the courtyard in highly resistant concrete, would create torsion and push building A out into the courtyard. Just imagine... Yes. Well, no, of course. So there's nothing to worry about? Nothing at all. We were painstaking and precise. Exhaustive. You'll get a detailed report but everything's fine. Here. - Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you so much. You do a fascinating job. Not always. Yes, really. It's precious knowledge. Very useful. It's tangible. Yes, that's true. You can tell the solid and lasting from the transient. That too, yes. That's true. I'll be back in touch soon with all the details. All right. All right. What did he say about the water seepage... What was this pocket again? No, this is the garage at number 148. Hold on. Look, what's this? The access ramps? Yes, the access ramps. Why's this arrow red? Stop it, Mathilde. But... Stop it! Oh, no! Thank you, Antoine. You're an angel. What are you doing? Seeking testimony. I want information. No one helps me. Others in the neighbourhood must have similar problems. What is it? Nothing... There may be more discreet ways. You look alarmed. Not at all. It's just that... Neighbourhood a! risk of collapse? The numbers aren't pre-cut. People can't take one. What an idiot. Thank you. I'll fetch scissors. - Wait! What a drag... Shit. Fuck... Hello, Antoine. Everything Ok? - Fine. Everyone's very pleased with you. People find you very efficient and discreet. They're delighted. You know my wife insisted on hiring you. And she was right. She's very intuitive. I'm pleased. Thank you. I also wanted to say... Don't get offended, Ok. She said you recommended seeing a specialist for the building? Yes, I did. I have to say that annoyed me a little. Really? Sorry, I was trying to help. She seemed worried... Yes, I know. I understand. But we shouldn't play along with her concerns. You understand? If she mentions it, change the subject. That should be enough. Let's put them all up. You'll get calls... I hope so! What about your volunteer work? I'm fed up of it. But it's important for you. The first time we met, you were really involved in it. You can't be everywhere. This is what I need to do now. I'm very intuitive. Excuse me... Your poster interests me. I have a shop nearby. It's not me, it's this lady. I just do the tape. Hello. I was telling your son I have a shop and I've heard of lots of similar cases. Hear that? Yes, I heard. People are worried. - Really? Let's go, Mathilde. I've often heard that the neighbourhood, 40 % of it, was built on old shale quarries. Mathilde, we really have to... Quarries? Incredible... I spent hours at City Hall, in every office, and no one mentioned that! Maybe they don't know. And they don't care. Silly, but I'm relieved. No, it's not silly. When you're right, you're alone. Have you heard about clay pockets by any chance? No... I run the esoteric bookstore on Rue Massard. Yes, I know it. I could order a few books about it. I must admit I'm worried too. I'll call you and we'll look into it together. It would be a relief. For memo! So let's do that. I'm Colette. - Mathilde. Thank you. Hold on. I startled you, I'm sorry. - It's all right. Listen, I'm sorry to insist, but I keep hearing sounds from the courtyard at night. Really? - Yes. This may sound strange to you, but I hear barking. Don't you hear anything? - No. Well I do. Perhaps it's Mrs Gauthiefls dog. - No, no. It's a big dog. It's very odd. Don't you hear anything at all? Not a thing. It must come from somewhere else. No, I recognize our courtyards echo. It has very specific acoustics. Enjoy! What's he up to? Lev! What are you doing? Exercise for Institute. Exact direction where they come from, those who come to take us, and save us. Right... You have to leave, or I'm going to have problems. I'm sorry but... Please, my salary too small. I can't have place. Can't your perpetual lighthouse you? No, forbidden. All right then. Tomorrow you clear out! What d'you want now? Really sorry. Do you have bit of dog food? I forget at work. No, I don't have anything. Hold on... This is really good. It's all I can give you. Thank you. This for you. Take. No, it's Ok. Not pay. Present. No, no thanks. Take. It do me lot of good. You know, I not always nice. Before, I very hard. Before, Lev bad person. In that case, I'll take it. I can't watch right away. I'm very busy. Fuck... My dog. I know. Go on, hurry! Good night. - Sure... Shit... What's that? Fuck... Laurent, come back to bed. It's ridiculous. I can hear a dog, dammit! You'll wake everyone! I'm calling about the poster. My building's sinking too. The second floors at ground level. I can't open my door! Help, I'm sinking! You suck cock, lady? I be! the walls shake when you screw. You wrecked your building! Any calls for me? How could you do it? How could you put our number up everywhere? I nearly put up my mobile number but it seemed wiser not to. Are you serious? We have a machine. It's ringing every 5 minutes! With jerks making fun or some panicked loser or sex-obsessed teens! It won't stop! - Ok, I'll unplug n. Realize what you've done? You can't just put stuff up in the street. What's happening to you? What are you doing? What I can, with no help. - I should help you go crazy? I feel so alone. No one helps me. Only Antoine! He helped with the posters? No, he has enough to do. You're lying. I know you are. I saw him on the street. He acted odd. Where are you going? To tear them down! Before I go nuts too. Yes? I'm hereto see Mathilde. Someone for you! Am I in the way? - No, I'm leaving. I tried calling but your line has a problem. It's always busy. - No kidding? Hello. Yeah... Serge, I hear a dog barking in the yard at night. And I hear bullshit all day long. This place is a madhouse! Did you hear it last night? Well, no. I... What? I heard you. Me? Yes. You heard me barking? I wanted to see if the dog was going... "J GHSWQT. It may seem odd but... No need to justify yourself. Your barking doesn't bother me. I don't "bark". I just wanted to check something. Mathilde, look. It shows the old quarries. And the hill nearby... The whole area's like Swiss cheese! In San Antonio, Chile... a neighbourhood devastated. Houses swallowed by the bitumen. Swallowed! Mathilde, listen. A landslide in a mine two streets from here in 1882. 27 miners buried alive. The bodies are still there. Incredible! Right under the local supermarket! I receive you. I receive you. I am received. Show the direction to our brother! If no one prays, no prayers are answered. When you love people, you show them the path. To find the way, show the direction. Our cousins from the sky will come from there. Can I help you? - Are you the janitor? I have the chairs. What chairs? 40 plastic chairs and the trestles. The lady said you'd help. Mathilde... There's a guy with chairs. Yes, stack them here for now. Until when? There's a co-owners' meeting tonight. It's mild, so we'll have it in the courtyard. Was it planned? Does Serge know? We have to staple these. Too many loose sheets. At least "Subsidence and Mining". And "East Paris" too. Why is it jammed? There's a slide in the projector. Is Serge with you? Is he helping? Excuse me. Yes, we're shaking too, Mr Gauthier. All right. We'll serve snacks first and then start at around 8:30. I shouldn't be doing this. Doing what? I'm here, spreading Boursin... It's absurd. I should say something to you. But I don't know what. Say you understand me. I understand you. Shit! Hello, Antoine. Someone having a party? I don't know. Sorry to ask you this but I think I saw you barking the other night. We're going to begin. Sit down. Sit down, please. You're an owner? - Yeah. Everyone's here. Good evening, everyone. Who's that guy? I've asked you here... Da Silva, a con man. ...to talk about a threat... facing our building and the neighbourhood. I don't believe it. My wife's mad, Antoine. She's mad. In our apartment, I found a horizontal crack that got bigger and deeper until others appeared... The development... of this crack worried us. So we turned to a specialist. That specialist, Mr Girard, was extremely reassuring and categorical. Everything3 fine. The building's healthy. So? Like any intelligent person, we asked for a second opinion. It seems things are worse than we thought. Let me introduce Mr Da Silva. He's an expert in sounding and filling cavities. When the case arises, we can do it. His diagnosis differs. You have a report in the files on your chairs, along with an estimate and a full analysis. 136.000 euros? Are they crazy? What is this? Please listen to me. Who is this guy? We've prepared a slideshow. It won't take long. Colette... Here's the neighbourhood in 1953... Sorry, that's... It's the wrong way round, Colette. That's Silesia. You've got it backwards. Colette... - It's not me! It's the remote. Excuse me. It's the wrong way round. Sorry, but it's not easy. I have to... Got it! Here we go. Thank you, Colette. No... You've gone too far. No, not that one now! Stop the thing! I'm useless with modern stuff! Antoine, help us! That's sick! Don't look! Go back to your rooms! Right now! It's jammed. I'm sorry, this is terrible. It may seem absurd but... Mr Gauthier, just a minute... Mathilde... Shit, I dazed off. Serge... Can you recap for me? I'm hungry- Any Boursin left? What's going on? Dog banned in hostel. What? No way... For fucks sake... There's a Doberman in my bed. I just got a great stash. I'll go for that then. At 17, Milan bought me. I'd made it. I was gonna get it all. I already had it all. In my first game, my first game, at San Siro... I scored a header in front of 25.000 people. I was in heaven. Sometimes, I'd go out to the supermarket, just to see... Girls would kiss me... They kissed me like a pop-star. After, I'd go home... laughing... I loved my life so much. I loved my life so much. 3 months later, like a jerk, a training injury. I was within reach, so close... and, snap... it was over. The insurance paid for this place. I came back 9 years ago. I bought a big screen, an Xbox and never moved again. Fuck... Shit. Shit. Yeah, shit. I've lost all my super powers. Antoine... Hello. I've brought your dish back. That's kind. Come in. Come in. Did you like it'? Delicious. I don't see you anymore. Are you all right? It depends. In the morning, I'm not so good and I'm scared. In the evening, I feel better and I'm ashamed. I thought you might like to go out. Serge says I made a fool of myself. I'm scared of seeing people. Or scared they'll see me. No one blames you, Mathilde. People understand, you know. They know who you are. We can sneak out if you want. I'll exfiltrate you. Where? I don't know... A museum. Or a park. Or a bar. Anywhere. When I feel down, I go to the park to watch kids playing football. Or I go back to places where I was happy. I don't know... It will do you good. A little walk... Get out and about... Seeing people... You think so? Yes, I'm sure of it. You're talking to an expert in despondency. My sister and I always came here. We built a hut. We got on so well... And you don't anymore. Families are strange things. You're so close during childhood. Almost too much love. Then it slowly fades away. Sometimes, all that remains is sorrow and bitterness. You think everyone betrayed everyone... Do you have any family? Yes, a little. Here we are. That's my house. My God... Shall we go in? I don't dare to. I'll ring the bell. It's all right. Hello. Sorry to disturb you. My friend lived here as a girl and we were wondering if we could look around. It's incredible... When did you live here? In the sixties. Did you fill in the old pond? No, that was done before we arrived. But I've seen photos of it. That's sad... We used to have fish. I had three. Gloomy, Ruddy and Pickle. The bathrooms gone! Yes, it's upstairs now. We expanded the living room. It's handier and sunnier as we often eat here. What a pity. From the tub, you could see the oak. The oak! Why did you chop it down? To get the afternoon light. It was 300 years old! We should be going... It's absurd. You don't chop an oak down, you trim it! I'm sorry... What's wrong? - They chopped down the oak! Who'? - Your parents! Mummy, why did you chop it down? Let's be going, we have a train soon... That'll do now... Where is it? Where's my father's studio? Where's the... I have to go. You demolished it? He built a glass roof with his brother! It was beautiful! It was a ruin and we needed room for the au pair. It's crazy! Look, they put in some Swedish thing! Why's the lady shouting? Because your parents have wrecked my house! My God, Antoine, just think. I terrorized that family. It's my fault. We should never have come here. Look at these houses and buildings... People... want to stay at home. They thirst for calm and normality. Then I turn up and bark at them! What came over me? What's going on? What's happening to me? What a fucking idiot... What an idiot... That's not for you. Let me work. Hello. We're going away for a few days. A runner will pick it up Wednesday. But... Leave me your keys. When he comes, I'll let him in. I don't have spares. All right. Thank you. Careful. Fuck... The dog's eating the model. He is? Shit... Shit! Fuck! Look... Yeah, perfect. Careful. - It's Ok. Fuck! Shit. It's crap. - No, it's sticking. It sucks. He's going to notice. Straighten the... Straighten the people. Raise the dead. The labourer there... I'll put him back too. Perfect. I'd love to live here. The ideal project. Nothing could happen here. You'd be bored shitless. Look. I'll add a dope distributor here. Outside the mall. Available to all. Look... "Oh, I'm tired tonight. I'll buy a bit of coke for Saturday night." Mrs Scarface is doing her shopping. "It's good stuff this week." "It's the sales." OK, Mathilde? He was here first. Go ahead. Thank you. Lev, what's the problem? I good. But now Jos sleep here, he catch eczema. In evening, apply ointment. What? No way. You must. Listen, Lev, I can't keep Jos anymore. Yes. - No! I have problems. He's not easy to hide. And he ate Mr Maillard's model. I can't take him hostel. I pay for modem. What? I can't. Tonight, then no more. Stay here! Last time, Ok! What is it? Are you Ok? I need to stay here a few days. I'm sorry? Just a few days. It's important. It's not possible. This place is tiny. I already have a pony! Serge wants me committed. Mathilde... No... I heard him calling our doctor for advice and asking about a clinic. I swear. Will you help me? Please, Antoine. I haven't slept for a week. I'm exhausted. A few days, no more. I need trust and sleep. But I need calm too and I know you calm me. No one told me that before. Please, Antoine. Is what you said about Serge true? Of course it's true. He's a former Stalinist, you know. They always intern the opposition. I'm making you laugh. It's helping. You do me good. I was right. Why do you hide to do that? I don't hide, I isolate myself. It doesn't bother me. It bothers me. How does it feel? It gives me energy and soothes me. It gives me time to do what I can. It makes me enjoy everything. And, physically, it's pleasant. It makes me talk too. And, above all, I'm here and... when I want, I'm not here. Sounds tempting. It is. And, after, I scratch my skin off for three days. My back hurts, my belly hurts, I have diarrhoea, I sleep all day and I want nothing. No more libido, no desire. Only shame. The one thing that soothes me exhausts me. I think that sums it up. Been using it long? - Yes. Never a lot, always a little. Maybe that's even worse. Not too many endives... You don't like endives. Not really, no. You make an effort for my sake. A little, yes. What is it? You're so kind, Antoine. Well... you're kind too. It's terrible. I can't tell if you move me or if I'm in a totally depressive state. See you tomorrow. Gwen thought she saw you but she wasn't sure. I came on Sunday but... What are you doing? What are you doing here? You're living here? With someone? Why did you leave? You don't just leave like that. Know how often I've read this trying to understand? Don't read that. "The impression of being a dead branch... Of not feeling anything at all." Anything at all? What does that mean? I'm talking to you! Answer me! I'm ashamed. Don't stay here. Come home with me. I feel so sad, Antoine. I envy you. "He slept on his hands. On a rock. On his feet. On someone else's feet. He slept on buses, trains, in airplanes. Slept on duty. Slept beside the road. Slept on a sack of apples. He slept in a pay toilet. In a haylofi. In the Super Dome. Slept in a Jaguar, and in the back of a pickup. Slept in theaters. In jail. On boats. He slept in line shacks and, once, in a castle. Slept in the rain. In blistering sun he slept. On horseback. He slept in chairs, churches, in fancy hotels. He slept under strange roofs all his life. Now... he sleeps under the earth. Sleeps on and on. Like an old king." Mathilde? Know what state the model arrived in? No. I'm not stupid! It was fine when I handed it over! I still hear the dog! There is no dog. There is no dog! Mathilde, tomorrow I'm going to talk to Serge. You're not getting any better. You haven't said a word to me for two days, and I miss you. You're far away, Mathilde, and it hurts me to see you like this. Why won't you talk to me anymore? Because it scares me. We were wrong. I don't do you good. On the contrary... I think I hurt you. You shouldn't stay here. It's not good for you, nor for me. You're made for life. It kills me seeing you like this. Excuse me, I'll only be a minute. No! Enough now. Keep your dog. But I cannot now. I go sleep hostel. Keep him now! Just keep him. Listen, Hired... I tired too. I exhausted! I'm sick of this crap. You not nice, Antoine. You always angry. You not read Zak. Fuck Zak! Understand? Fuck him! There. Not say that! Not say that! Ever! Understand? Got it'? You Ok? Yeah. Wanna come up? I can't right now. Got anything left? Hold on. Antoine! Let me... Antoine, let me... Serge! Serge, answer me! Antoine, can you hear me? Cardiac arrest from an O.D. Let's get him out. Sir, please get out of the way. Pascal, stop, he's having another cardiac arrest. Continue the massage please. Ga?lle, how lung's it been? 42 minutes. Antoine... My poor Antoine... I think he came here to vanish peacefully, to fade away quietly, to feed before dying. He probably felt I! was the idealjob: washing, scrubbing, slowly dissolving in everyday life and pine-scented cleaner. He had chosen the lodge, and I, landslides and global warming. I don't know how long I took to start living again. "Is Greenland melting? Yes..." How many days, weeks or months. I don't know when I started to come back. But if! had to set a date, I'd say it was that night on seeing him motionless, pale, dying... That night I saw I had reduced the world to a whisper. That night, I realized that despite my obsessions, my anxieties and fears, I had to do all I could to return to others. I was afraid to call the hospital, afraid of hearing that Antoine was dead. Serge swore that he wasn't. But we all know that lies told by those who love us are the fines! declarations of love. Subtitles: Ian Burley Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
