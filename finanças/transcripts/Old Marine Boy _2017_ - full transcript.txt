Jeodo Fishing Ground will open on April 1. Please don’t cross the Northern Limit Line. There is a risk of being abducted by North Koreans. Of course, we know you don’t leave the fishing zone on purpose. But the Jeodo Fishing Ground is very close to North Korea, and there are warships around, which could lead to abductions or attacks at any time. So I’d like to remind you to stay alert and try not to cross the line. Don’t try to pass that boat. Slow down! Don’t pass that boat! The fishing ground on the border opens today. It closes in the winter and reopens on April 1. It's small, but on the first day it opens, the catch is amazing. So every boat in the area shows up. -One more! -One more! Cheongjin ship, pass! The area is quite close to the North Korea border. The coast guard, marine police, and battleships come to check the area. Security is very tight. There are only seven Meoguri ships, but around 300 ships with female divers and ships for catching octopus have come. The ocean isn't big enough for all of us. What a crowd! It's like a war! Wow, that's incredible. The number of boats has increased terribly. It’s increasing every year. The female divers don’t have to come so early, but they’re ahead of us, trying to catch everything. Enter the Jeodo Fishing Ground now! We can reach North Korea in one minute if we go fast. This area is the border between South and North Korea. So military tension is high. Many military training drills are done here. The next day, there are traces of military training left on model airplanes in the water. The compressor pushes the air through the yellow hose delivering it to the diver. The diver depends on this hose alone. For the diver to descend, the air is let out to help him sink. When ascending, the air fills back up, and the diver comes up to the surface. Don’t go down too far in front. There are too many octopus boats. Susanho boat is in front of us. In the small area of the Jeodo Fishing Ground, we often run into other divers. If the hoses get tangled up or caught, we would be unable to go up and could die. We must quickly go back opposite ways. Did some of the octopus boats leave? -None have left? Not a single one? -No, they haven't. It's been dangerous since morning. Catching more octopuses isn't necessarily a good thing. There are no spots. Since there are too many boats. Is this spot fine? We have to go further. We can’t do it here. Not here. There’s no open space. Stop the boat. Do you see any open space? -Where are you trying to go? -We have to stop here. Hurry. Pull. One. Put it over here. And bring one more basket. I think we can use two more. CONSIGNMENT SALES RECEIPTS PARK MYONG-HO My daily routine. I leave home at 5:00 in the morning, start diving at 5:30 or 6:00, come up around 12:30 or 1:00, and then eat lunch and rest. After that, I exercise. And my day is over. The day after tomorrow, are you available? That day is Malbok, the hottest day of the summer. Let's have dinner together. I already asked Seong-gwan to come along. Let's have some healthy, wholesome, chicken herb soup. Yes. -That's good. -Come here. -Hello. -Welcome. It's this, right? You made it. -Hello. -Welcome. You're late, so we started without you. We're having a party to celebrate Malbok and I invited all the runaway communists. Pour everyone a drink. Since some of you don’t know each other, I’d like you to introduce yourselves. -Do I have to say where I’m from? -Is my cellphone over there? -Attention! Please listen to me. -Okay. My name is Ok Seong-gwan. I’m 42 years old. I was born in 1973. I live in Geojin and I work as a compressor diver in Sokcho. That’s all. And your hometown? Hometown. -My hometown? -Tell us. My hometown is Haeju, North Korea. My name is Yun Yong-jin. I’m 42 years old, the same age as Seong-gwan. I’m from Chongjin, North Korea. I’m from Hyeryeong, North Korea, and I came to Korea in October 2007, so I’ve been here for seven years. I’m in the process of trying to build a new life here. You know that mountain in Seoul? Bukhan Mountain? If you throw a stone from the top of Bukhan Mountain in Seoul, will it hit a Kim or a Lee or a Park? They say it'll hit a Kim -because there are so many Kims. -There are just as many Lees. That's how it was in the old days, but now… You'll hit a cab! That's a joke. The wife of a diver must always be psychologically prepared to stand on her own two feet. You must be able to support yourself. You must develop yourself. You must have a skill to make a living. When a situation arises, one can get through it. I'd be too worried about you to ever die. I’ll be fine. Life always goes on. Don’t worry. As a diver, if I die while working underwater, that would be a great honor. I’d be the luckiest man. I would be able to pay back my wife who has taken care of me until now. She’d get about two million won in insurance payouts. That would be my last gift. My mom used to say a man's looks don't matter as long as he makes you happy and provides for you. That's why I love my husband. When he was a North Korean soldier, he urged us to defect to the South but I said I didn’t want to run away with my boys. I was scared and said never to speak of it. Since we were born in North Korea we should have stuck it out there. But I couldn't see any future in North Korea. There's nothing on TV in North Korea. So we secretly watched TV shows from here. I felt we could raise our boys and support them with our skills, even in the South Korean countryside. I was in the North Korean military for 20 years, since age 17. I experienced North Korea's ups and downs. So I made the decision to escape from North Korea. It took several years to come to an agreement with my family. It took six or seven years to convince them. Most defectors go through China, but my family decided to get on a boat and sail down the West Sea to South Korea. But we didn't have any navigation equipment, so there was the danger of getting caught in the wrong current and returning to North Korea. We've seen many people get executed from that. We had to avoid North and South military out in the sea. They can shoot because they can't tell. I picked the direction and rowed, and my wife kept watch at the bow all night. The fear I felt then… I thought my heart would explode. My wife's face was ashen when we got to South Korea. She got huge crow's feet overnight. We left North Korea on May 24, 2006 and arrived in Incheon, South Korea on May 25. It was like we died and came back to life. A rotten and corrupt capitalist society. Fierce competition. A place that only cares about money. That’s what I was taught about South Korea. I wondered how we'd make a living there, if we went to that society. Since we knew nothing. I’d do compressor diving, if nothing else worked. I learned it in the North Korean military. JEONGSEON MARKET Let's have a look at the wild ginseng. Wild ginseng. WILD GINSENG Do your hands and feet become numb often? For pain in the arms, legs, back, and joints, these bamboo poria are amazing. Bamboo poria. How much does 300g cost? -It costs 10,000 won. -I’ll take 300g. You don’t know if it’s good or not. -It’s good. -How do you know that? I can tell just by looking. My work depends on my health. So my health comes first. Wild ginseng, deer antler, and even snake soup… I eat these things every year. I try to eat anything that is good for your health. That's how I survive. Yu Woo-sung came from North Korea in April of 2004. Meoguri is such hard work. If I work underwater when I don't feel well, my body aches the next morning. My knuckles and back hurt. Decompression sickness hurts so badly at night. A sauna would be nice but I don't have one at home. So it's better to go to a hotel and stay the night to unwind. You wouldn't able to work the next day anyway. I couldn't work out today. Myeong-seong boat's diver got decompression sickness, and I got a phone call asking me to take care of him. He worked deep underwater for the first time. It was his first time catching sea squirt. He said he had a stabbing pain in both arms. His work probably didn't go well. He never used to dive for sea squirts, but he got injured because he went too deep. All compressor divers get some level of decompression sickness. We call it "Shiberi." He came up to the surface in a hurry. Some die, some have rotting flesh. Some become disabled and can't use their legs. I give them first aid. I bring them underwater again and make them exercise at low intensity. In the good old days, there were around 30 divers here. Some died and got sick and now we have only seven. I've seen six divers die since I've come here. It's like one dies almost every year. Diving suit, nine kilograms. Helmet, 15kg. Front lead weights, 11kg, back lead weights, 10kg. Shoes, six kilograms each. It's around 55 to 60kg total. It's over 120kg including my own weight, so if the hose is cut and no air comes in, there's no way I can float up. What compressor divers fear most is their air hose getting cut. If the crew doesn't pay close attention, the hose can get caught on the propeller, and sometimes the hose gets severed. And that's it for you. You're dead. It's impossible to escape from the diving suit. You work in the netherworld and live in this one. A compressor diver is always standing between life and death. It's 7.6kg. Yong-jin coughed up blood. He's at the hospital. -He coughed up blood? -Yes. -When? -Yesterday. -While diving? -Yes. -It was the water pressure. -Really? He coughed up blood, and he got taken away by an ambulance. They say he needs an organ transplant. Organ transplant? Which organ? His liver is messed up. You need to get surgery? Why are you going home without getting it? I need a liver donor. There’s no donor. You’re done? What happened? After working underwater, I came home and was taking a shower, and I felt nauseous and threw up. And blood shot out. You almost died. Something burst inside because of the water pressure. If the blood hadn’t come out, it would’ve coagulated and killed you. This means you can’t dive anymore. You must not. Poor fellow. Yong-jin and Seong-gwan came to me after they defected. There wasn't much they can do in South Korea. So I trained them as divers and got jobs for them. They are like my brothers in South Korea. Living here is making me more like South Koreans. When the weather’s bad, I don’t feel like working. Whenever I don’t feel like working, I tell myself to remember how I felt when I first started working. If I don’t go to work today, my family will starve tomorrow. That's how we get to work. North Koreans live hand to mouth. That’s true human nature. Humans are most beautiful when struggling to survive. When you run a business, you hit many obstacles. You should hit them. And when you do, you fight, regardless of whether you win or lose. As long as you’re not sick. HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY CENTER PATIENTS IN WAITING You got treatments twice, in August and October. Yes. You didn't feel any symptoms in the meantime? Is there a difference in symptoms when you’re underwater and on land? It doesn't hurt underwater. At all. I feel comfortable. But it starts aching when I’m out of the water. As long as you continue working, you will suffer these symptoms. But you can’t quit working and just get treatment. Come and get treatment whenever you have time. You can go in now. How is that? Can you feel the air? -Let’s start. -Okay. I can’t work like this. I can’t work with such bad air. Look at my eyes. I can’t keep them open, so how can I work? Unless you change the way you pilot, I can’t work. There were exhaust fumes in the hose. The exhaust gas will ruin my eyes and my lungs. How can you drive this boat so badly? You must park the boat so the exhaust faces the back. I knew he'd quit. But nothing could be done. The South Korean crew says that working on a boat for Park Myong-ho, a North Korean defector, is the worst job ever. I know they talk behind my back. Cheol-jun? The driver of the ship quit. He quit. I think you'd better come here again and help me out. Although he's the type to do anything for family, there's no way he would like this work. He must be scared as well. He knows he'll die if anything goes wrong. That's why he called me to help. There is no one to depend on but family. Working alongside his family is my father's dream. Why do you exercise so hard? Every day? Because I use my body… for my work, so it's a must. If I'm not well, work is no fun. If I'm sick, it's unbearable and painful. This is the North Korean People's Army exercise. Before doing this in the morning, we'd chant, "Destroy the Yankee American imperialists and South Korean puppet leaders!" My father and I, both generations… My father spent 40 years in the army, and I, 20. That's it for us. It's time to end the division of the Korean people. No more military life. The end. Race! On the birthdays of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jung-il, kids received candies and snacks. We had to spend Chuseok without receiving anything. The biggest holidays in North Korea were their birthdays, April 15 and February 16. The Chuseok holiday was nothing. -You can’t do it, can you? -I don’t know how. Doing this is how you celebrate Chuseok. Try it. Go wash your hands. If you want to get married, you must learn this. I don't. I can buy them. Pinch hard so it won't split open. It'll split open if you don't pinch hard. Look at this. It's a failure. Father, you're pretty good. Of course. It's okay. Go wash your hands. You got flour on your hands. Cheol-hoon is almost here. Did you put on some weight? He has not! He’s almost as skinny as a zombie. You’ll have to make him exercise while he’s here. He needs to work on his physical strength. Father, I bought you whiskey. -You bought this? -Yes. You’re a better son than I am. Of course. I’m over 20 years old now. They sell this at your university? Of course not. What kind of university sells whiskey? It looks like a college student. Mom's disappointed because you didn't bring wine. Last time I brought wine, so I brought whisky. I bought some wine. -You did? That’s great. -You bought it? I couldn’t rely on you kids. Your brother is making a sacrifice for the family once again. -You're going to work with him? -Yes. When I first bought a boat and became a shipowner, he gave up going to college and helped me, and that’s how I was able to get this far. He hasn’t forgotten how to do the job, has he? Why did the driver quit? Why did the driver quit? He quit for his own work. He is quite old, right? He is old enough. Everyone has their own path in life. Wake the boys up. Cheol-jun. Wake up. Why hang up the South Korean flag on Chuseok? Isn't it weird? People don’t? I thought people did. Here. Move backward. Backward? Over there. Whenever there's a national holiday, I miss my parents and my hometown in North Korea. So I named my ship Cheongjin, after my hometown. CHEONGJIN When I was a kid, I used to dive underwater there. I wish I could go and dive there again. Before I get too old, before I die, I wonder if I could go back. -To unification. -Cheers. Your big brother's making sacrifices again for us. You’ve never done it once. I’ll look after you for at least 40 years. I’m not going to live another 40 years. I think I need to study at least ten more years. -Stop talking nonsense. -Ten years? It's not like you're paying for graduate school. We have to pay for that. I’m sure he’ll pay for graduate school tuition. I should pay for it. Dad promised me he’d pay -for my graduate school. -Of course. -Graduate school is… -That's ridiculous. I should at least pay for graduate school. Is graduate school three years? This is what graduate school is. It’s where the professors make money. If you don't show your good side to the professors, they won't let you graduate. When I think about that, I don’t want to go. University is a business. It’s all a business, didn't you know? You have to be rich to educate your child. Cheol-hoon, if things don't work out, quit university and become a sailor. I’m not you. You think a college degree will give you success? -Do you? -Eat up. Cheol-jun takes after our dad. How he thinks, I mean. And I take after mom. Dad is very decisive. If he makes a decision, he just does it. When we settled down here, the South Koreans here tried really hard to stop him. South Korean people have a web of relations, family and relatives. In a way, those connections are a kind of asset. But we only have each other, the four of us. We have no relatives. We had to build each of the steps we had to climb up. At first, South Koreans pitied us because we were from poor North Korea. And when we started moving forward, running our own businesses… After that, as I wanted more, they tried to stop me. VOTING POLL People saw North Korean defectors as cheap labor. They just overwork us physically. There's an atmosphere of not letting anyone be better than South Koreans. Things you need to survive in this society… Wealth. Intelligence. Power. Connections. We have none of that. Except for physical strength. If we lose this, we have nothing. There is nowhere and no one we can depend on. This is the one. I can only get this at the tax office? You need this one to get this one. CERTIFICATE OF BUSINESS REGISTRATION So I have to get this one first and bring it along? DAEJIN FISH MARKET RAW FISH, CRABS A raw fish restaurant would be perfect for you. It's a real lifelong job. We'll be busy during the summer sea urchin season, and the restaurant will be busy, too. But we can hire part-timers. After Cheol-hoon comes back from taking language courses in Australia, your mom will be familiar with being the boss at the restaurant. Your mom has to run a business. Considering her personality and character, it’s your mom who should run a business, not me. Since I ran a business instead of her, our family hasn’t become very rich. Peace Raw Fish? -Peace. -Peace? Write "Peace" on the sign and… Catching and eating fish is about peace? Listen to me. Write "Peace" and put a map of both Koreas and write "Raw Fish." I'm not really feeling that. Then what do you want? Everyone, come up with something. It should be "Wild Raw Fish." -Wild. It speaks to you. -Look here. Everyone has the word "wild" on their windows. So we should have it on the sign. That won't look right. Ongryugwan. That's the name of a North Korean noodle restaurant. Subarashii Raw Fish. Doesn’t it sound nice? It means "excellent," "splendid" in Japanese. There’s "Diver’s Raw Fish" somewhere, right? They even have "Compressor Diver’s Raw Fish." But we should call ours that. Put it there. Hey, you moron. Slow down! Don’t pass anyone! That guy is piloting his boat badly. Really badly. It’s all sand under there. Pass through here and stop between the boulders. Let’s go. I’m coming up. There are no rocks here. Read the area and stop the boat. If they don't stay there long, they didn't do anything. So we have to go to where they were and get to work. That’s their strategy. If they act as if they already worked there, they think that we won't come. After they go to a different spot, they'll sneak back here and catch everything later. We have to read them. Those boats are reading our every move. That’s what the driver does. -Hey! Turn on the compressor! -Damn! -Come here. -Okay. They were hungry but waited for you. Did you drink? I have nothing to worry about right now. Cheol-hoon? I don’t care about him. But when it comes to you it is not the same. Why? Because I got you into this. It is the turning point in your life. You agreed to do this, so the responsibility is on both of us. That goes for what happened today. What happens on the boat? It’s actually quite simple. What made me annoyed at you was just that. I am responsible for my work. But because you paid less attention than I did, that's what happened. And that's what annoyed me. Isn't that right? Am I wrong? I was quite distracted since it was 4 a.m. I was drowsy and made mistakes. Then, Dad scolds me badly. He said, don't work like that! And don't be sloppy! But, I am doing my best. But, he thinks that it's all my fault. So I feel hurt. I am not that happy about this work either. There is nothing for young people to do here in the countryside. No friends, no girls. I sleep, work, sleep and work. It is so routine. Dad doesn't feel safe, so he always works very hard. But it is too much. I can't keep up with him. I don't know how much longer I can take. Moron. You scumbag. I escaped from North Korea in September, 2007. Then, Cheol-jun's dad asked me to come here for helping him. Because I have been friends with Cheol-jun since I was in North Korea. There is no sea in my hometown in North Korea. Only rivers, no sea. It was amazing to see the sea for the first time and this is my first job too. -It is crooked. -It is. I don't want to learn how to swim. I've got to go to the gym now. If you are working on a boat, you should know how to swim. If it's an emergency, I would do it! In an emergency, you'll drink a lot of water and shout "Help! Help!" That's how you'll be. True. One, two, three! Do you want to come on board? -Hook me up. -Okay. Help me. -Just a second. -Hurry up and grab it. One, two, three! One, two, three! Hey, the water's not coming out. The water isn't coming out. The cooling water isn't running. It's the O-ring seal. That's the problem. It's stretched out, so it doesn't fit. CERTIFICATE OF BUSINESS REGISTRATION FROM THE CENTRAL SPORTS COMMITTEE OF SOUTH HAMGYONG Hello. You didn't go to work today? -I did. -Then? You’re going to be rich. This will be a huge hit. CHEONGJINHO RAW FISH RESTAURANT You should be a success. Successful or not, what's mine, my world, what I've built… Even if it's small, we're more desperate to have it than South Korean people are. Because we've never had anything of our own before. Thank you for coming. I hope you become rich. I wish you good health. -Did you go diving today? -Yes. You’ll get rich very quickly. Abalones, conch, sea cucumbers, sea pineapples, sea mustard, kelp, brown kelp. We catch them all. If you serve this much food, you can't make money. Not true. We make a good profit. We serve what we catch. I just have to bend down one more time. You can blow it all, honey. I’ll allow it for three years. That’s okay. If she still makes no money then, she’ll be fired? That’s just fine. But if there’s never a big break… Lose all your savings after three years and be homeless? Right. You’re just talking big. Your husband is supporting you, so you're lucky. I opened this restaurant because he begged me to. I’m sure your husband has plans. Do I have that many wrinkles? My goodness. You can tell I had a hard life in North Korea from the photo. Of course there are no customers. We have no friends or relatives here. But it's still very stressful. Goodness. Why weren't we born here? If we'd been born in this country, we would've had friends, relatives, and siblings, and we could rely on them when things got hard. But we don't have any, which is sad. Thank you. You arrived here after a great ordeal, but building a life here isn't easy. South Korean prejudice against North Korean defectors leads to poor treatment and lack of concern, and this is causing more and more people to feel dejected. We're going to blow up these balloons. Who's going to finish first? Get ready! I should've told her I loved her I hesitated and lost her You can get whatever you desire You can become whatever you want to be And for this benevolent land We are singing to celebrate it Oh, the Republic of Korea Oh, the homeland of our ancestors Oh, we will love you forever Together! For my family, we're from North Korea. We are now citizens of South Korea. But we were born in North Korea. We can't ignore that. What my dad said before we defected was that he wouldn't do it if it were just him and mom. He said because of me and my brother, he had to do it before it was too late. In North Korea, my dad was a very responsible head of family. He's not very young. What he fears most is not being able to work and what to do if his family was in a dire financial situation. I think he constantly worries about that. Why are you packing so much? The backpack. Didn't you say you have two? I think this is mine. Is it Brisbane, Australia you are going to? -Let's have a drink. -So long. -Just so long? -For Brisbane! Come up. What is it? The cooling water isn't coming out. It's not coming out? Is the engine okay? Can you handle it? Did you turn the motor off? -Did you turn it off? -What? The engine will melt and blow up. It’s almost melted. Almost? -It hasn’t melted yet? -Not yet. When the ship broke down, I felt like I was broken. Ever since I escaped from North Korea, I kept working. Because I feel insecure. Honestly, I am still scared when working underwater. But what I can do? That's life, isn't it? You can't avoid it even if you want to. I am the father. I am the husband. I still remember that dark night when we crossed over from North Korea. Nothing has changed since that night. We're still restless in the South. I'm always in danger underwater. There was a life-threatening accident with a diver, and people didn't know what to do. No one could take charge or decide what to do. Take the helmet off, don't take it off. It was crazy. They did nothing but talk. No one really helped. If that happens, if that actually happens, just follow the instructions I laid out for you. -You have them written down? -Yes, I do. I've already chosen my burial spot. Over there, in that valley. You and Cheol-hoon carry me and go there with a shovel. Don't go to a fancy funeral hall. The funeral should only cost 50,000 won. Don't go to a place like that. -Just lay me down at home. -In a coffin? Why, when there’s my diver’s suit? Just like that, even with the helmet on, you can bury me just like that. -Dad, you're 50 now. -Yes. If we assume you live 30 more years, won't North and South Korea unify in the next 30 years? You have to go to North Korea. South Korea isn't trying to unify with the North. Let's go. When the man named Lee In-mo returned to North Korea from the South, he wrote a nice poem about azaleas. Although not the kind of scarlet red of a rose, in early spring, they hurry up and bloom powder pink before any other flowers. They bloom in bashful powder pink. Azaleas. These are for me? They’ve already bloomed? Aren’t you surprised? -Let’s put them in a vase. -Yes. I’m coming up. IN MEMORY OF JIN TAE-SIK
