Mom! Grandma, Mom is here. - Oh, you've grown so much. - Mom! How are you? Did you miss me? I enjoyed swimming. No one taught me that. Look at your complexion. You'll be darker in no time. You'll be here until the 15th? - You know, - The other day, - Sir Ruben said, - I'm the only one they trust. Whoever finds the one-peso coin - can have it. - One time… Goodness, the kid… - It's hard without me, Mother. - Brother Teng - thinks he's all that. So arrogant. - What? - You just came and you'll leave soon. - He's weak. Wait a minute. You keep talking. What did I teach you? When you're eating… I know. You shouldn't talk. Right. What if… you swallow that first before talking. And drink water. The nerve! He's a peeping Tom. What? Who? Jonathan. Who's Jonathan? That's Ruben's son. He barged in here. Who? Jonathan? No, it's Ruben. But why, Mother? The kid had a busted lip. What? Mom, he's a pervert. What? Your daughter beat him. Well, maybe… I would've hit that kid too. Jeez. - Gosh. - He's a pervert. This girl really took after you. Are all of these gifts? Mother, you know, those are… those are Louise's old clothes. But Mom, short dresses are not allowed. Well… Ruby, this is not short. Look, the length is all right. Hey, miss, you have a lot of scars. That's what I've been telling you. She keeps on riding the bike. No one can stop her. - I'm so good at riding the bike. - Really? And I don't fall anymore. Jonathan is just selfish. He doesn't lend me his bike. You know, Mom, if you had bought me a bike, I wouldn't lend it to him either. Really, Ruby? Can you hear what she's saying? Mom, did Louise make the bracelet herself? I'm the one who tied it. You know, Mom, I made that myself. Right, Ruby. You're so good at it. You're really different. You're still young, but you can be left alone. When I'm gone, this is my only wish, Norma. Take good care of Ruby. Mother, what do you think of me? I'm not sure. Maybe you would put other children first before your own child. Here we go again. Mother, you keep on saying that. I just feel sorry for her. She doesn't have a father. And her mother is gone too. What do you want me to do, Mother? Grandma Tersing, should these be the same size? Well, somewhat, but as long as it's round. What if it's long? I said it should be round. If it's a bit… flat. What are you even doing? I just told you that it should be round. That's why it's called "rice balls". It's round. Why are you angry? Is it bad to ask? Hey, don't be a smart-ass. This kid. Hey, Norma, look at your daughter. Mother, hold your temper. Ruby, it should be round. Is Louise stubborn too? That kid. Goodness. She's so quiet. It's like she's afraid of people. Because everything is forbidden. Nothing is forbidden there. Whatever she wants to do is allowed. Even tong-its? Why are we suddenly talking about tong-its? There you go. It's pretty. Your hair is fixed now. Don't touch it, miss. You might ruin it. Miss? She's my mother. I know. We'll go to the river later. Will you come with us? Swimming? Hey, be quiet. Come with us? My mother is here. You're weak. What do you mean? Why won't you come? Hey, stop talking. Sit here. That's rude. Hey. Please, all stand. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Jonathan, over there. Fine! It's over there! You're so slow! No, it's you. There it is. See. You didn't catch it. There's more. Faster! Mom, do you know Lisa? She's Jonathan's sister. She threw up on the bus. So they said - she should've said something. - Huh? How old is she? - She's five. - Five? So that her vomit is not wasted. So they can put it in a sandwich. Hey, Ruby. You keep learning nonsense. Who told you that? From Jonathan. Mom, can I go with you? Ruby. Please, Mom. We've talked about this. I won't throw up, Mom. Please. It's not about throwing up. We already agreed. You should stop. Ruby, what did I tell you earlier? I can't go with Mom. You already know it. My bus is here. I'll go now, Ruby. Nanny is here! Hey! Did you miss me? Right? What did you do? I was only gone for a while but you became heavier. She has been waiting for you all day. Louise, you're giving her a hard time. Norma, have you eaten? I'll eat later, sir. Hey, you have food here. Come on. Eat it. Don't make your food wait. I don't like it anymore. - What? - You don't like it anymore? Your mom cooked that because that's your favorite, right? This? It's delicious. Fine. Gang up on me. If you don't like it, don't force yourself. Did I say something? Gang up on me. It's fine. Ma'am, shall I cook? Thank goodness, Norma, you're here. - Noel! - Why me? Why did he call? They'll consider me for the regional office. It's true! Really? Come on, baby. Go to sleep. Louise. You're a big girl now. But both of you still call her "baby". She's a big girl now. Norma. Norma. Ma'am? Yes, ma'am. - I'll go now. - Okay. Take care of my daughter. Is your ride already here? Nanny. Mother Nanny. Okay, take care of her. Take care, ma'am. It's Bunnica's birthday next week. Again? How many birthdays does Bunnica have? Cupcakes again? Mother Nanny, please. Goodness. Just promise me that you won't be stubborn. Gosh. Someone is at the door. Hang on. Mother Nanny. What did she say? Mother Nanny? She calls you Mother Nanny? She says that when she's fond. Oh, maybe my granddaughter is closer to her nanny than her mommy. Louise, Grandma Toots is here. Did May not tell you about it? She did. Wait. I'll just get it. Your mommy is gone again. Poor granddaughter, always being left to her nanny. Here it is, ma'am. Tell my daughter to visit me often because my granddaughter doesn't know me anymore. What? You have a visitor. Why would you lock yourself in here? It's because you're short-tempered. These are not leveled. - Nanny? - What? That? You know, she looks like Ruby. They have the same complexion. It's because that kid is always in the sun. Like a wanderer. Wanderer? Wanderer. How can I explain it? She's like a stray. She's always out. She's not at home often. Like that. Oh, is she allowed? Yes. That's how it is there. There you go. We're done. Don't be rowdy, so your hair won't be ruined. Come here. Really? She'll be happy when she finds out. She'll be excited. Hey, you know, miss, you should learn to organize your things. You're a big girl now. And I'm doing a lot of things downstairs. But you're making me repeat it many times too. Can you do this? We won't tell on you. Come on. It's easy. - Wow, that's great! - Wow, that's great! Can you do it with just one eye open? - See that? - Will you be mad if I take Norma from you? You're so lucky to have your nanny. She's caring. Gosh, I might die if she leaves. I wonder why no one stays with us for a long time. If I ask you to choose, your nanny or your wife? Jeez. This one. She'll choose the nanny, for sure. I know that. Believe me. - Kids, what is it again? - You've really grown, even your tummy. - You keep on eating. - Baby? It's ugly. Louise. There's coal in your eye. It's ugly! - We'll take it off now. - It's ugly! - Ugly! - You're ugly! Ugly! May, the kids are just joking around. But that's not a nice joke. Boys are really just like that. It's okay. Okay? Since when was it okay to do that to a girl? - Stop it. - No! - We'll go ahead. - Okay. Call me. What they did is annoying. There's an "N" already. Does Bunnica have two Ns? Okay. Do you really want to help? Answer the phone first. Come on. Come on. Do it, so we would finish soon. Nanny. It's for me? It's for Nanny? I can't hear you. What? Since when? Ruby, stay with Aunt Tess for now. Right. Don't be stubborn. Ruby! You're so… Stay there, Ruby. Yes. Okay. …our prayers. Wash us and cleanse us of our sins… Norma, when will you bring Ruby to us? Maybe the day after tomorrow. Is Ruby okay with living with us? That's the thing. I still haven't told her about it. But Tess, thank you so much for letting Ruby live with you. You're welcome. Ouch! …through Christ our Lord. Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come, thy will be done… Ruby. Ruby. Why are you still there? Why don't you go to sleep? Ruby. Mom, I don't want to live with Aunt Tess. What? Where do you want to live? Ruby. Ruby, you know I can't take you with me, right? Why is it like that? If only I could take you with me. But you know I can't, right? Tess, thank you. But don't hesitate to call me if you need anything. Of course. Don't worry. We'll take good care of Ruby. Ruby. Ruby, I'll go ahead. So, go ahead. Ruby. Your mother will visit you on her vacation. Right, Norma? Mom! &lrm;My child. Mom, please don't leave. Grandma is already gone, but you'll still leave. Please don't leave me. Ma'am, watch your daughter. Mom, are we almost there? Keep in mind everything I told you. We're just living with Louise, so you can't do everything you want. Yes, Mom. Don't forget that. No littering, don't make noise, don't turn on the TV, don't go out, don't take their food, and don't play with her toys. Remember all those things. We're just living with them. Mom, you already said that. I know. Remember that. Don't forget it. Mom, you forgot something. What is it? No farting. Jeez. Nanny. &lrm;I've been waiting for you. - Are you good? - Mom. Ruby. She's Nanny's daughter. Aunt May. Ruby, wait. Don't call her "Aunt May". I already told you to call her "ma'am". Oh, right. Ma'am, thank you. For what? That you let me live with you. Don't call me "ma'am" anymore. It's too formal. What? Call me Mommy May. But ma'am, other people might say that we're too familiar. So what? As if you're not family to us. That's it for now. - We'll sleep here. - Mommy Nanny. What? Ruby. Stay here. I'll just put her to sleep. But Mom, you'll leave me again? It will just be quick. Remove this and change into pajamas. I'll be quick. Come on. Let's go. Hey, it's one o'clock. You said that it will just be quick. Ruby, I'm tired. I'm so tired. Come on. Let's go to sleep. Mom, you gave me this, right? Louise, you said that you don't like it anymore. Norma. Sir? Norma, have you seen my phone? Norma, please open the gate. I'm in a hurry. Yes, sir. Mom, please. I'll just open the gate. Louise, may I borrow this? Sure. But she doesn't look like me. She looks like a black woman. You know, we can dress them up. Louise, the house is really beautiful. I wish we could live here. Did you see me? It's nothing. We can dress them up. Okay. The fairy is mine. She's beautiful. - Norma. - Yes, ma'am? Did you see my scarf? It's here, ma'am. Mine can do this. It's good that they get along well. Eat up. It's still hot. Ruby, did you wash your hands? Yes, Mom. Why are you doing that for her? Can't she do it? Yuck, why are you eating the head of the shrimp? Because it's delicious. Right, Mom? You two, you talk a lot. Let's see who eats faster. Come on. Eat up. Hey, you can do it. - Step on the pedal. - I can't, Nanny! I don't want to. There you go. You almost got it. - Here. - Nanny! Oh no, we're falling. The bike is heavy. - Stand up, baby. - Nanny. You don't have any wounds. - Nanny. - Come on. Stand up. - Stand up. - I don't want to. How will you learn? I don't want to! Nanny, she took my bike. - Stand up now. - Nanny. - Ruby. - I can do it, Mom. Ruby. - I can do it, Mom. - Yes. You're already good at it, Ruby. Stop that. Give it back to Louise. Come on. You're good, but you're making me dizzy. - Come on. It's too hot. - Mom! Louise is throwing a tantrum. - Ruby! - My bike, Nanny. Louise, where did you last put Bunnica? I told you I don't know! I can't finish what I'm doing. Can I do this first? - Come, Nanny. - I don't get it. Why is Bunnica missing? Wait. Let it go. Go. My shirt is getting loose. You left it here, right? You put them together. Did you find it there? It's not here. Where is it? Louise, it's just here. What's this? That's what I'm talking about. When you're looking for something, you should use your eyes, not your mouth. Hold this. Louise, you're hurting me. Yes, but next time, use your eyes when you're looking for something. That's enough, baby. You won't be angry anymore, right? Okay. That's enough. Stop that. Okay, miss, don't be angry. Don't be angry. Enough. Is this authentic? Mom, of course, I won't give you a fake one. There was a sale in Hong Kong. Louise, don't be too rowdy. Is that Norma's daughter? Yes. Her name is Ruby. Noel said that you'll send her to school. And in Louise's school. I've enrolled her already. They will be classmates. Money is hard to earn these days but you let in another freeloader. And you'll send her to an exclusive school. That kid is so lucky. Mom, Norma is no stranger to us. And we didn't pay that much because she's a scholar. I don't care. I'm telling you, they'll take advantage of it. Abuse your kindness. Have you seen the kids? The kids? I haven't seen them. Where are those kids? Where are they? You two, take a bath now! You're giving me a hard time again. There you go. Rinse off the soap. Rinse it. It feels nice. It's so refreshing. Jeez. I knew it. Come on. Let's go. I'll carry you. I'll carry you. Let's go, baby. Have you seen anyone take a bath without washing her face? That's just you. Wear this robe first, so that… Okay, stay here. Wear your slippers. Wear it. Ruby! Ruby. Take a bath! We're done. Come on, Ruby. There you go. I'm the one sweaty now while drying your hair. Ruby, I'll be there soon. I'll just dry her hair. Mom, I can do it. I'm not a baby. Really? Okay. He's Ruby's friend. Louise. - Norma! - Ma'am? Yes, ma'am? Please close the door. Yes, I will. - We'll go now. - Ma'am. We'll also go out. I'll take Ruby somewhere. - Why don't you come with us? - Right. No, it's fine. We'll be uncomfortable. Thank you, ma'am. - Okay, we'll go ahead. - Okay. Mom, thank you for buying me a lunch box. That will be useful when you go to school. But Mom, whose is this one? We will give that to Louise. But it's a secret. Don't tell her. Yes, Mom. - Mom. - Yes. I think I heard a secret. You heard something? - What is it? - Grandma Toots asked why they had to let in another freeloader. But Mom, what's a freeloader? Why did you have to listen to the conversations of adults? I already told you about it. I told you not to listen. Louise, it's taking too long. Can I put my King on your stack? As long as it's a King. You're so stupid. Hey, Ruby! Why did you answer like that? Your tone is different. Tong-its. I don't want to play anymore. You don't know how to play. Hey, stop that. That's enough. Because you cheated. I didn't cheat. You did. I didn't cheat. You did. It's you who cheated. It's you who cheated. I told you to stop it! You're too stubborn. See that? Is it my fault? It's your fault. Mom, are you angry? I don't know about you two. You're like cats and dogs. You don't listen. You're too stubborn. Mother Nanny. With the way you're acting now, will you stop fighting? You, Ruby? Yes, Mom. How about you, Louise? Dear Grandma… Toots. That's too many "O" s. Now, write one for Cocoy and Carlo. Come on. This is the last one. Oh no! Hide that, Ruby. Hide it. Nanny. Cover it. Louise. Why is the door locked? There she is. Okay, move closer. Be seen on camera. - Sure. - Come here, Ruby. Wave at Daddy. - That's it. - It's her birthday. Come on. So cool. You can see even the deepest part of the pool. Louise, try it. Come on. You're so fussy. Nanny will be mad at you. You're so wet. Louise, your mommy is calling you. Come here. You'll blow out your candles. Why are you dressed like that? You can swim again later. Oh no! Louise fell! Louise! Are they okay? Come here! She drowned. She drowned again. She drowned. You're ugly! You're too soft! Ruby! What are you doing? Come here! Ruby! - Louise! - Hey, brat! Stay away from my son. Ruby, come here. Come here. What are you doing… Mom, they pushed her. Come here. Where's my beautiful granddaughter? Blow it now! Hey, you two. Who gave you that? Where's the card? It's not this one. They gave you a different gift. Here we go again. Give me that, Ruby. Tong, tong, tong, tong, pakitong-kitong There's a crab in the sea It's big and it's delicious Ruby, don't play with it. It's hot. Can you see the smoke? Look, it went inside. Don't play with this. You're turning everything into toys. Don't do that. Wait. I have to taste it first. Just right. It's not too sweet. Oh, Sir Noel is here. Ruby. Bring this to Louise's grandma. Be careful. It's hot. Ma'am, Ma'am Toots is here. You're a thief! Give me that! Give it back! How did you get this? How did you get that, you thief? You're shameless! - Give that back! - What are you doing to my daughter? - Why? - Mom, what are you doing to the kid? - She stole my gift. - What? This kid stole my gift. There it is. She's wearing the necklace I gave Louise. - Did you take this? - Give it! Did you take this? Why did you take this? Give it to me! Thief! - We'll give it back. - Thief! Here, take it! Let's go, Ruby. I told you… Stop crying, Ruby. That's enough, baby. Mom, I didn't steal it. I know, Ruby. I know that. Your mother knows. &lrm;lt's all right. You know, Mom, she pushed you because she's defending her daughter. What if I injured myself? - What do you want us to do? - Send them away. - What? - Norma has been Louise's nanny since she was a baby. So what? Everyone is dispensable. Look at you, taking the side of the nanny. I'm the one who got hurt and still, I'm the bad one. What now, Norma? Can't we talk about this? Norma, we just want to clear things up. We know that Ruby is not a thief. But we all know that already, right? Please cut to the chase. We'll just leave. Check their bags before they leave. Can't we talk about it anymore? Ma'am, my decision is final. We'll just leave. There you go. What is there to talk about? Nanny… Louise, you'll come with me? Louise. Among all of us here, Louise is the only one sensible. And baby, no one's leaving. What room will you be in? Take care. Ma'am? They're in Grade 1 now. Wow, adobo! Nanny's adobo is so delicious. My mother cooks adobo really well. - Who's your mother? - My nanny. You call your nanny "mother"? No, Nanny. Why does Ruby call her "mother"? Because she's my mother. You have a visitor? Jeez. That old lady will have dinner at the house. Who? Louise's grandma. Louise's grandma? Are you still mad at each other? If I'm the one she hurt, I can take it, but she hurt my daughter. Poor kid. It already happened. It should be over now. Whatever. I just don't like her. I hate her. Honestly, if she's standing at the edge of a cliff, I'll push her. Hey, that's too much. You're mean. Thank you. You should stop that. Louise, can I have a sticker? Just one. Sure. Louise! Nanny? Ruby! Come down here, you two. Quick! Come on! Mom, why? What happened? Come here, Ruby. Stay here. Keep an eye on her. Just stay here. Mom, why? What happened? - Is she dead? - Call your dad. Wait. Call your dad. Quick! Get the phone. Quick! Ruby, don't leave her. Just keep an eye on her. Nana! Where are you? Come! Do you have a driver? - No. I'm the only one here. - Oh no! We'll just take a taxi. Get out of there. Go see Louise inside. It's her grandma. Just go inside. Quick! Stop! - Are you trying to kill yourself? - Quick! The old lady might die! Please make it fast. Step on it! Open the door. Here you go. I'll stay here. Quick. Hey, call Sir Noel. Call him. Tell him - we're going to the hospital. - Okay, go now. - Mom. - Ruby. Is Louise's grandma dying? No, that can't happen! Sir, make it fast! Go inside now! Will you wake up Louise? Sir. I'm surprised you're already here. Sir, how is Ma'am Toots doing? She's out of the operating room, but… she's still in the ICU. When will she be discharged? We're not sure yet. By the way, Ma'am May called earlier. She'll be back today. Yes. I just forgot. We talked earlier too. Okay, I'll just wake Louise up. Sir, you look so exhausted. Looks like you haven't slept. I just went home to change clothes. I need to go back to the hospital. No one will watch over Mommy. By the way… the doctor said it was good that she was treated quickly. Thank you for bringing her to the hospital. Anyone will do that, sir. No, Norma. Your mother always buys shoes that are a snug fit. Jeez. Louise, is your grandma not dying anymore? She's not dying anymore? The bus is here. Take care. Mom, I can do it myself - What? - Don't walk me to the gate. Are you sure, Ruby? Yes, Mom. Where's your mother? Maybe she's doing laundry. She's doing laundry. Oops. Here's your food. She's doing laundry. Mom. Do you need my help? You can help me. But wait. Are you done with your homework? Yes, Mom. Thank goodness you're finally done. Mom, I'm done. Please have a look. You're done? Yes, Mom. Okay, I'll check what you've done. - Let me see it. - Here it is! Wow! That's impressive. You can find a partner now. Mom. Can you give me 50? What will you do with it? Can I buy stickers? You'll spend 50 pesos on stickers? Ruby, you can't do that. I'm telling you that now. Then I'll just see those scattered everywhere. - Mom. - Ruby! What? I'm telling you that it's expensive. I'm not a bank. You hear that? I can't buy everything you want. It's just 50 pesos. That's wrong. I can't give you everything you want. Remember that. I'm working here. You know that, right? Look at you. Hey, Ruby! Hey! Ruby! Hey! Ruby! You're throwing a tantrum now? Stop that, Ruby. You know so well that I've explained things to you. We're here in Manila so I can work. Right? Everything is wrong! Ruby! Get out of the room! You're making me angry. You're making me sweat. - Norma? - Let's talk... Is there something wrong? Oh, ma'am. It's nothing. It's just Ruby. She's throwing a tantrum. What's her problem? She's asking me to buy something. What is it? Don't mind her. It's just stickers. You wanted me to do something? Yes, Norma. Please change the blanket and the pillowcases in the room downstairs. Do we have a visitor? Yes. We'll pick up Mom from the hospital. - Ouch. - Be careful. It's too hot. Ma'am Toots? - She's staying here? - Yes? Until when? Until she gets better. So, I'll leave this to you. - Yes, ma'am. - Take care of it. - Leave that here. I'll take care of it. - Thank you. Mom, slowly. Does it hurt when you walk? It hurts. Let me help you sit. Yes, I know. You treat me like I'm useless. I had heart surgery, not brain surgery. It's hot. Is the air-conditioner broken? Louise, kiss your grandma. Where's my kiss? But it's really gross. Do you want to see it? I was asleep then. But when I woke up, it was very painful. Of course. Imagine being sewn. It would've been better if I had just died. Mom. Mom, don't say that in front of the kid. Anyway, Mon and his kids will visit you. But his kids are too rowdy. Tell them not to come here. I don't want any visitors. Don't point the air-conditioner at me. I'm cold. Mom, we're just outside the room. Mom, you can rest. Thank goodness you're here. I've been waiting for that. Wait! Come back. Where's my change? I bought tamarind candy. All of it? Yes, Mom. Ruby? What were you thinking? When there's change, give it to me. Don't do this again. You know, you smell bad. I can smell your sweat. Take a bath. We'll go out. We'll go out. Mom! Mom! Noel has already left. I didn't know you were coming. Carlo! Cocoy! - Hello, Mom. - Where did they go? They'll attend Mass, then they'll buy Louise new shoes. What time will they come back? Give her some tea. They might be home late because they'll watch a movie. Wow, what a life. Why are you annoyed? We're here. - It's behind you. Give it to me. Quick! - It's there. What's this? Tamarind candy. Tamarind candy? You're not allowed to eat this. I don't know. I saw it there. It tastes good. Here, Mom. Carlo! Cocoy! We're here! - Hello, Grandma! - We're here! Be careful. - Wow, tamarind candy. - It's mine. - This is mine. - Stop that. - Grandma, just one. - Enough. How much for this one? It's just 3,750 pesos, ma'am. What? That's too pricey. It's almost as much as my salary. Those shoes are expensive. Okay, give me one that's a size 2. Sure, ma'am. Stickers again? You already have a lot of stickers. This is the last time. - Okay, but it's really the last. - You're copying her again. You shouldn't follow suit. Ruby, stop that. - Please, Mom. Me too. - Ruby. - Please, Mom. - What will you do with the stickers? Please, Mom. You'll just scatter it everywhere. But it's expensive, Ruby. Okay, fine. - But just one. - Let's go! You want those two? Mom said I can only have one. How much is this? Okay, I'll buy these for you. Really, Mommy May? - You're getting that, ma'am? - Yes. Wow, are these all yours? Your mommy is so kind. Come. Let's pay for those. And it's painful. It's just at the side. Watch me. It's like this. It's your first time watching a movie, right? I've watched a movie before, just not in the cinema. Like that. Mommy, it's Ruby's first time to watch a movie. It hurts! Pour some water on it. She said it's Ruby's first time watching in a cinema, but Louise is more excited than Ruby. You're right. Your skin will flay. It's there. Mom, Louise is so playful. It's like her first time in a cinema. Just watch and eat. Maybe they're fake. Like "Skeechers". "Skeechers". It has the wrong spelling because it has two Es. Maybe those are "Skeechers". May I see? How about Norma? Will she come with us to Singapore? We have to get her report card. - Your nanny. - Your nanny. Look, this is ours and Grandma's house. - Yes. - And this is you. - You're hanging clothes. - You really included me there. Yes, Mom. Then, this is me. While I'm looking at the sun, I'm swimming. You did well, Ruby. There it is. We're there. She included us, Ruby. Mom, have a seat. I'm Ruby's mother. It's nice to meet you. I'm also Louise's nanny. Ms. Arabit. Can Mother Nanny get my card? It's the school's policy that only the parents can get the report cards. But ma'am, Ma'am May gave me a letter and she asked me to give it to you. Okay, but please tell Louise's mother that they should get the report card next time. This is Louise's. Thank you, ma'am. You're like a mother to Louise anyway. - Thank you. - Okay. Let's look at your grades. Lea! Look at that. Ruby's average grade is higher than Louise's. It's because sometimes, Louise, it seems like she's not from this country. She speaks English most of the time. That's why she has a low grade in Filipino. Norma, what if we lived abroad? What? Then, let's just get a tutor. I said it the wrong way. What I mean… If ever we lived abroad, would you come with us? What about Ruby, ma'am? That's the problem. Don't say that, ma'am. I can't say no to Louise. But I can't bear not being with Ruby. Never mind. Don't think about it now. It's not even sure yet. What are you doing here? - Nothing? - What do you mean? Where's your mother? She's already asleep. She might get mad at me. I'm not doing anything bad. But what are you doing here? It's because you might die. What? Like my grandma. I thought she was just sleeping, but she had already died. She didn't want to wake up. I'm scared it might happen to you. Okay, go to sleep. I won't die. But why did my grandma die? Because it was her time to go. I don't want you to die. What can you do about it? If you're going to die, you'll die. Go to sleep. Don't worry. I'm telling you that I'm not going to die tonight. Leave me now. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Miss, where are the rubber shoes for kids? They're here. We have a lot of new pairs today. - Here. - Yes, that's what I'm looking for. There it is! Miss, I'll get this one. - How much is this? - That's just 250 pesos. Very cheap. That's not cheap! How about 200? I'm sorry, ma'am. That's the final price. Oh no. How about 220? You can have it for 230. Please make it 220. Then the change will be my fare. Please. It's hard, ma'am. You know, that's for my daughter. It's my gift because she got high grades. Fine. Since you're our first customer, - you can have it. - Thank you. - What's your daughter's size? - She's a size 34. This one, size 34. Thank you so much. You know, that's exactly what she wants. She'll be so happy to see it. No, it's for Ruby. Really, Mom? Yes, Ruby. Open it. Mother Nanny. Louise, when your mommy comes home, you always get a gift. Ruby only gets a gift this time. Ruby, what is it? Guess what it is. Very good! I knew right away. Come on. Try it on. That's very nice. Mom, why did you buy "Skeechers"? What "Skeechers"? - This is fake. - What? This? I don't think it's obvious. Come on. Try it on. - It fits. - I don't like this. Ruby, that's all I can afford. I can't buy one like Louise's. That's expensive. I don't like that. If you want, you can give that to someone else, but I don't want that. Ruby, come here. Get that one. I bought it. It's for you. What are you doing? Ruby! The shoes will be put to waste. I didn't know it's fake. Never mind. Nanny. Do you have homework? You know, you should change. You're sweaty. Go upstairs. Come on. It's fine. - Nanny. - Go ahead. I'm fine. Louise, wear your rubber shoes. The bus is here. This kid is too stubborn. Why are you wearing them? Those are mine. Take those off. I said those are mine. Take those off. They were given to me. You said Nanny can give them away. Why? Did Mom give you those? Louise, here's your food. Get it. Come on. The bus is here. Quick! Mom, can you help me? But you told me you can do it yourself. Have the kids left? Yes, ma'am. I made you a sandwich. Thank you. - Norma. - Ma'am? We want to talk to you. What is it, ma'am? Are you leaving? We'll go to Singapore before Christmas. You can come with us. But who's going to take care of Ruby? Don't you have any relatives who can take care of Ruby? Norma, you will earn more money there. You can have more savings. If I don't go with you, who's going to take care of Louise? We'll be forced to look for another nanny. Okay, ma'am. I'll think about it. Mom, Louise and I had a fight. She took my rubber shoes. Mom, tell her to give back my rubber shoes. And why is she greedy? Mommy May already bought her shoes. She wants to have everything. She's so greedy. Mom, please tell her to give me back my rubber shoes. She doesn't want to give those back. Mom, are you mad at me? Don't talk to me now. Why not? I'll leave you alone. You see? I'm still alive. Can I stay here for a while? But you're already here. Hey, kid. Aren't you comfortable there? I hope that's all right with you. You're like Grandma Tersing. You like to annoy me. Does your mother know you're here? She's mad at me. So she likes Louise better now. How did that happen? You're her daughter. Yesterday, she bought me shoes that are fake, so, I don't want to wear them. I understand you. I also don't like fake items. This morning, I saw Louise wearing those shoes. What? Louise wore those shoes even though they're fake? Yes. That's why both of them are mad at me now. You have to apologize. I'll have to apologize? Why me? Why do you think Louise wore your shoes? Because she's greedy. She wants to have everything. She's jealous because she didn't get a gift. Come here. Sit. If your grandma were alive, she would pinch you. You're wrong. What's wrong with what I said? Don't be stupid. Use your brain. Why did Louise wear the shoes your mother gave you? Because my mother bought them. Very good. But if I wear those, Alexa and Margarita will make fun of me. They'll say that I'm the nanny's daughter. Who are Alexa and Margarita? They're our busmates. Are your busmates more important than your mother? Of course not. Hey, don't cry. If you're going to cry, get out of my room. Your mother might think I did something to you. - Ma'am? - I want to talk to you. Are you better now? You should've waited for me. My butt hurts from lying down too much. Give this to Ruby. You almost killed her because of that and now, you're giving it to my daughter. Do you know how much this is? You should be thankful that I'm giving you this. You can have it. Don't give it to her. Why? Why don't you want to take it? Why do you insist on giving it? Do you think I feel guilty, that's why I'm giving it to you? You're something else. You're a nanny but you think highly of yourself. But ma'am, I know I'm just a nanny, you're the boss, but the way you treat us is inhumane. I know you'll let Ma'am May know about this. You'll tell her that I'm too much, but in fact, you're the one who's too much. What? Is it bad that I want to give this to your daughter? If you don't want it, you can throw it away. I just lost my appetite. Ma'am. If you really want to give this crucifix necklace, you can give it to Ruby yourself. Is she really your daughter? Her heart is so pure. That kid was raised well. I've been calling you for a long time. Can't you hear me? Mom, tell Louise to give me back my rubber shoes. What now? Who's this? Louise! Mom, you're wrong. I'm wrong? You're wrong. Ruby! Why? I want to see it. You're cheating, both of you. - You two! - Come here. Where are we going? - Come on. - Where are we going? My bag. Wait. - Come on. - Where are we going? There you go! It's fun, Mom! If I had to choose between Louise and Ruby, who would I choose? If the ship is sinking, I can't save two. Ruby is my daughter. There's a saying that blood is thicker than water. But I treated Louise like my own child since she was a baby. It's almost like I raised her. It's not that I can't choose. For me, there's no need to do it. I love them both. If the ship is sinking, I'll offer my life to save them both. Don't scatter that everywhere. There you go again. Louise! Hey! Louise! Louise! Stop that. I wish I could go there too. She said I can't. Why is it like that? I'm always left behind. Even if you'll have other friends? Louise, I'll miss you. Louise, say bye to Ruby. She wants to stay here instead. Is she staying here? Bunnica? Why are you leaving me? Because… no one will take care of Ruby. Nanny. Stop crying. I told you, you shouldn't cry. Right? You shouldn't cry. Stop crying. You're a big girl now. You shouldn't cry. You should… stop crying. - Right? - Louise. Mother Nanny. Norma. Take care, both of you. - Yes, sir. Take care too. - We'll miss you. Don't forget me. Subtitle translation by: Cyril Dayao
