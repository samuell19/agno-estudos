(gentle music) (Zelzah sighing) (phone ringing) (Zelzah exclaiming) (breathing heavily) - Fuck it. - [Sazerac] Hey Zel, I'm back in town and was thinking, grabbing a bite at our spot. I'd love to see you, if you want to be seen. Okay, guess this is the message. (soft music) - Fuck. If you call me ma'am, one more time, I am going to pull out this palm up and smooge them around your ears so that whenever you digest your food, you'll hear it and it'll make you go mad. - Oh my God, okay. No more ma'ams. Okay. You win, you win. You were saying something before all this. - As I was saying. - I'm sorry, but if you're gonna look so sexy, you can't possibly expect me to pay attention. Ma'am. (soft music) - [Zelzah] Please don't bring up that oxygen mask analogy. It's some bullshit. - What is wrong with ensuring that you can breathe before helping others? - [Zelzah] I don't need to breathe, before I help somebody else breathe. - [Speaker] Why do you think seeing him is such a bad idea? - [Zelzah] Isn't it? I mean, it's not like he's not, not gonna be in New York anytime soon. - [Speaker] Well, seeing him again doesn't necessarily mean you'll get back together. Unless that's something you want. - [Zelzah] I wouldn't want that. But I don't know. (soft music) - You're here. - So are you. - So, that's a no on the hug. Got it. - Yeah. - That's okay. Rome wasn't hugged in a day, or wait, it did burn down one- - Why are you here? - My gravest apologies. I'll be professional from here on out. Ma'am. The gallery wanted me to do another exhibit, so I came, to St. Louis. - Good for you. - We're always trusting our gut. What if our natural inclination towards self-destruction, shouldn't our gut be the last thing we trust? - Then what guides you? Doing the opposite of what the little voice inside your head tells you? - Well, that seems like it can cause problems. - Maybe your intuition is God speaking through you. - I thought you didn't believe. - I don't fucking know, but there's something there that says, this guy Sazerac, he's something. So, see what kind of something. - [Sazerac] What? - Nothing. It's just, you're here. Wasn't what I was expecting when I woke up this morning. So, how was your flight? - It was fine. Not much going on. - [Zelzah] Not fair, we were the fourth largest city in the country. - [Sazerac] Only a St. Louisian would brag about being fourth best. - We have the oldest botanical garden, the second oldest symphony orchestra. I mean the arch is the tallest monument in the country. Forest Park is twice the size of Central Park and we hosted the best world's fair of all time. - Chicago might have something to say about that. - Chicago can eat a dog dick. - You know, New York is pretty cool too. - Well, you're from Long Island so. - Hey, now. (Zelzah exhaling) - I'm good, I just, we get unfairly knocked around. - It's not you though. You're not St. Louis. Someone could say shit about your hometown, but they're not saying shit on you. - It just feels so unfair though. We have shit. Fuck. We have more World Series titles than any other team in baseball. - The Yankees have- - I said baseball. If the pitchers can't hit, that's T-ball. - It's okay. You're okay. - [Sazerac] I love you. Oh, this is not a you treating me kind of situation. - Oh, I thought you were treating me, guy from out of town visiting, but you know what? Sure, straight down the middle. - So, what are you up to after this, fancy cocktail party with the creme de la creme of the St Louis art's scene? - Well, you know, it's 10 in the morning and the cocktail party's usually winding down by now. - I don't know how it all works. I'm down here with the hoi polloi. - I thought the hoi polloi were fancies. - Nah. We're down here in the mucky muck. You're high above. - High or not, I've got nothing going on. You? - I got errands and shit, but this was, yeah. - Of course. Yeah. Do your thing. This was, nice. (soft music) - Shit. - What? - [Sazerac] The newspaper says the world is going to end in eight minutes. - Shit. That is a serious bummer. Eight minutes, huh? - Oui. - What shall we do with the time we have left? - We could complain about how the world is going to end. Or, (Zelzah laughing) (soft music) I want someone who I wanna talk to, who makes me laugh and think. Who I wanna you know what. Who I also like to look at after said, you know has been. You know? Who I can partner with and grow with me as I grow. Who I can also like raise kids with. I gotta find all that in not only one person. - It's a lot, but what's a real alternative? One for, you know, one for friending, one for partnering, and one for rearing? That's a lot of ones. - I'm just saying, why I gotta do things the way someone else tells me they gotta be done? - Okay. You've found a system where you can get everything you've ever wanted and more. Hit me. - No, no, I'm the one who says what's wrong with the system. You're the artist. Build me a new one. - And then can tell me what's wrong with it? - Finally, you're getting it. Come on, build me a system. - I'll be the, you know guy. (Zelzah laughing) - I got some time, but I gotta stop at home first. - Yeah? Cool. Should I? I'll meet you there. Fuck. The man who laid these bricks. What do you think, they were thinking? - You mean like sense of satisfaction, and the job well done, or more like, fuck now we gotta start another building? - I mean, don't you think about the love that would grow here? Fights. The spills. The kids. - Oh shit, our kids. I forgot, do you have to feed those things? - No, the couple that was here before me. Now, they had a kid. I mean, that's why they moved but, for a few months, there was a kid here. (gentle music) - Maybe they passed by while we were here. Smiled to themselves. We had a good time in that place. I hope they do too. (soft music continues) - [Zelzah] No, you gotta wait outside. - [Sazerac] Okay. - [Zelzah] I'll just be a minute, I gotta change. - [Sazerac] Sure, but most people wait inside. - You wanna be most people? - No, it's just that I'm scared of getting mugged, or skyjacked. - Doesn't that usually happen on a plane? - Sure, usually. But these skyjacker are conniving mother fuckers. They're always one step ahead of what you think they're gonna do. - Aha. Well, at least you'll have a really good story. - Fine, but just when you come out, could you just please be better? I just- - Excuse me? - Sorry I didn't mean better. I just, if you wanna be mad at me, or whatever, I get it. I totally understand. If we're gonna go to the botanical garden, or something, I just, I want it to be better. - You've had days to get your head around this. I'm playing catch up. Have you seen tears? Have I thrown anything? Me going to breakfast and now maybe to the botanical garden. That is better. Now, if you can be patient, you're gonna get a better, better. (soft melancholic music) (gently sighing) - Great day, huh? - Yeah. - It's okay to have a bad day. - It's not bad. It's just frustrating. - Why don't you tell me all about your frustrating day? - Honestly, I'm okay. It's over. Done. (soft music) - So, how was your day? - Are you seriously still on this? - I know, it is so fucked up, that I wanna see what's going on with my girlfriend. - We were supposed to present to the city council this Monday and they just pushed it till after the reset. - That sucks. But doesn't it give you more time to prepare? - That is so patronizing. - I didn't mean you weren't prepared. Just trying to help. - Maybe don't. - Right, you're the helper, not me. - I, (sighing) that wasn't what I meant. That was shitty me. - Hey, something we agree on. - Is Unifying St Louis even the right place for me to do the most good? Sometimes I feel like I'm just sitting behind a desk doing Jack shit. I haven't volunteered in forever. I haven't been to a protest in forever. - UST wouldn't have the money to do shit, if it wasn't for the grants you're writing. But yeah, maybe it feels a little sterile. Like you wanna get your hands in it more, but you're not helping anyone, if you work yourself to nothing. - I just wish I knew I was doing the right thing. - That's not how this works. Truth is, you may never know, in part because it probably won't be solved in your lifetime. - What about the kid that starts school in a couple weeks? Just what, sorry? You're born a century too early. Try again. (Zelzah sighing) (soft music) - I forget. What's the street that always has parking on it? - It probably makes more sense if we take the same car. - Okay. (gentle music continues) - [Zelzah] You coming? - [Sazerac] Yep.

I'm good. (gentle instrumental music) (water trickling) - [Zelzah] This is some no bullshit shit. I need you to be honest with me right now. How'd you get to be so perfect? - When I was a baby, my mom held me by the ankle. She dipped me in the river sticks. Wait, or did I have beer dumped on me at a Sticks concert? - Give it a rest. (Sazerac laughing) (water trickling) I can't believe it's been a year. - I know right? It's really flown by. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'm flattered. I'm kind of in shock, but I love it. - I love you. - It's gonna be fun when I'm pretty much the reason you're famous. - I'll be giving interviews 50 years from now, being like, what can I say a muse is a muse? - I'll still be here in 50 years? - If you wanna be. - I do. (soft music) So, did going home get all your creative juices flowing? - It did. I painted some pieces I'm really proud of. Hence the show. I'd love to show you them if you want to. - Oh, I mean, yeah, maybe. Did you ever finish that one? - I did. It's kind of the main piece. How have you been? Busy saving the world? - Just St. Louis. - That's good though. - I guess. Sometimes it doesn't feel like much. - It's hard helping the hopeless. - St. Louis isn't hopeless. - I didn't mean to say that you are. That you all are. - What did you mean to say? - What you're doing is important. St. Louis needs the help, but not more than anywhere else, or less. - Okay.

(soft music) - [Zelzah] I was driving home today, happened again. - [Sazerac] Oh babe. - I just go to call her and then I remember, God, I wonder who has her number now? - Could you tell me about her? - She was, always taking care of other people, like all the aunties that couldn't, or wouldn't go to the hospital. Just all the fucking time in the world for other people. - I wish I'd met your mom. How'd she...? - Heart attack. When I was 20. I took the semester off to settle everything. Missed the deadline for the next semester. Plus there were all the aunties to take care of. So, I stuck around. Went to Merrimack College. - But you Chicago. - I know, but like, it just is. - What about your dad? - He had split up when I was 10. He helped, but like he lives in Little Rock with a little family. - You still talk to him? - Every couple of months. We cool. (soft music) - Without the Mississippi River, St. Louis ain't shit. It made us the king shit trading post way back in the day. Gave us mud that made the best bricks in the brick business. It carved out caves that kept cold the beer of an empire. - You had the caves, but you also need the influx of the Germans who didn't just see caves, but a cooling system. You needed both. - Ah, so many people just got the one. - I see it all the time. My grandma was the funniest fucking woman. - Must have died with her. - But the 50s wasn't interested in her being funny. So, she was depressed all her life. - Was she depressed because her brain was like, well, there's no way to be me? Or because she was a woman out of time? - I mean, probably both. Being in a place where your gifts are not only squandered, but seen as problems. It's fucking hard. - We're trained to make do with what we're given. - That's not a bad thing. - No, it's not. But, how much is too much? - [Sazerac] Are you ready? - [Zelzah] Mother fucker, I was born ready. - [Sazerac] Three. (bottles clinking) Two. (bottles clinking) One, go. (gurgling beer) (bangs beer bottle on table) (Sazerac laughing) (Zelzah giggling) Oh porns. - This is the happiest place on the earth. Fuck this neighborhood. How often do you get to be on a bus, hanging off the side of a building? - [Sazerac] On Long Island? More often than you think. - Oh okay, sure. Please. - [Sazerac] I have. - No, you haven't told me what's going on. If you had, we wouldn't be here. - [Sazerac] I'm feeling off, like that all of me is here. - But why? Please just let me in. - Into the bathroom? - Either, both. (people chattering) - [Sazerac] You ever feel like if you could just get outta your own way, then you'd finally be happy? - [Zelzah] But what would that even look like? Like the Buddhist ego death thing? - [Sazerac] I guess so, maybe. - So, you've got no ego, no sense of self, no desire. Sure, you've got peace, but what the hell else you got? - I felt like when I was young, I don't know, a teenager, I was on the cusp of something like figuring everything out. Like if I only did the right things, then I'd be happy. - Aren't you happy now, on Long Island? Isn't that why you left? - Honestly, I don't know why I left and I don't think I found the thing that I was looking for, but like there was this greater potential of happiness. Then again, maybe if I keep chasing that I will miss the happiness that I have now. - I always wonder if my natural state is peace, but in trying to fix things, I bring on all this shit. Or, if the shit is ingrained in me and if I fix things, I can be better. - It's probably somewhere in the middle. But how do you know the ones to keep, and the ones to leave behind? - [Zelzah] Intuition, I guess. - Is intuition a personal guide, or tailored by society? - My intuition voice, it feels different from my societal expectations voice. - [Sazerac] Any and all your voices sound good to me. - That's funny. They're all telling me not to fall for your crap. - [Sazerac] Don't fuck it up. - [Zelzah] I'm not gonna. Told ya. - Sauce. (Zelzah laughing) - Do you think we leave energy wherever we go? - That sounds like some woo woo shit. - Not necessarily. Everything is an exchange of energy. Heat is atoms moving quickly and shit. - Then, are you asking if energy has a memory? - Sure. Or, if we leave an outlet, so when we return we could plug back in and reconnect. - I don't know about that, but there's definitely places that when I return to, I can feel electricity flowing through me. When I see the arch, I get one of those kinds of smiles where you feel your whole cheeks. - So what's that? Why has my brain decided that that spot without fail, I get overwhelmed with happiness, but not other spaces than have just as much history? - [Zelzah] You must have left some sort of emotional trail of breadcrumbs. - I guess so. I just wish I had more control over it. - There's something nice about being at the whims of the winds of your brain. - Sure. Until it's a hurricane. - Where the fuck where you? - I'm sorry. - We were supposed to- - I know, okay? - No, it's not okay, okay? I texted. I called. I didn't know if you were dead, or not. - You thought I was dead? (exhaling deeply) - You don't show up to the movie. Okay, fine. No answer. Maybe your phone died. But then I come home and nothing. I checked in with Thomas and he said he talked to you two hours ago and that you even mentioned the movie and then you didn't come home. I thought you might have been in an accident. So, I started driving around looking for you. - I didn't die. - What the fuck? Or you're just not gonna fucking say anything? - I went to the movies. I was in the parking lot, but I couldn't get outta the car. I saw you standing there waiting for me, but I just couldn't get out. - Why? - I was thinking about you. I hadn't seen you since this morning. And what if during that time, something in your brain went off and you thought, wait a second, I can do so much better. - Are you serious? - You could go to a movie and you're in it and you hear an explosion in the theater next to you and you realize that there's a room full of people, a wall away watching something completely different, listening to something completely different, feeling something completely different. And you don't know them. They're just a person on the street, or they're your childhood sweetheart. And what have they been doing for the last 20 years? What will you do in your next 20, before you're a wall away from them again? I don't want to die not having done something. - [Zelzah] That's, a lot. - Are you mad? - Yes and no. - But some yes. - Yeah. It can't just be your anxiety, or whatever you felt was real. I drove the route you would've taken home, looking for an accident. That was real to me too. But, I'm also sorry for what you went through. I wish you felt you could have said something. I guess it's probably not as easy as all that. I wish you would see a therapist. - That's your answer for everything. It's always a fucking therapist. Why don't you see one, huh? - You're right. I probably should see someone, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't. - How about you worry about your shit, I'll worry about mine? - Most people don't not see a movie, because they're worried they'll die someday. - Maybe, they should. - Is that what you really believe? - I can't see a world where someone can help. I know what's wrong. I just need to be better. - Okay. - Is that a real okay, or is that a shutting down okay? - I mean, I want you to get help. And you think the help won't help. There's not a whole lot more to it, is there? - No. I guess not. Are you mad? - Yes and no. Are you mad? - Yes and no. (Zelzah sighing) (gentle music) - This area that we're in right now, this was Mill Creek Valley. - A place where- - 20,000 black folks got kicked outta their homes. Thank God we got all this. St. Louis has never known what to make of its blackness. (whirring traffic) You ready for the word? Well, you got the Osage people living and loving here on the river Mississippi. Luckily the chateau and a whole mess of French come. But actually everything's copacetic, till it's not. Once we become the hottest thing on the edge of the world, the city starts to get greedy. Why should the county partake in all our splendor? This is ours motherfuckers. So, they split from the county. My taxes are mine. And don't nobody give a about your taxes and everything's copacetic till it's not. Red lines come down and tell us where we can, mostly can't live. When we do go to those places, the white take flight, or places like Mill Creek Valley are deemed too dangerous. So they kick out 20,000 black folks and sure, violence goes up. But what do you expect when you make us so poor, we can't afford nothing else? And when you kill Michael Brown, yeah, we gonna burn shit to the ground , even when what we're burning is all we got. But I honestly believe if you bring the city and the county back together and spread that sweet tax money around, St. Louis can be a gateway to more than just the west. You feel me? (soft music) So, I'm 18 and I think I am the hottest shit to hit the fan. - I bet you were a heartbreaker. - I have this boyfriend. Ugh, love of my fucking life. Like in the way that you kind of just can't feel after a certain age. - Great, I'm so glad I met you after that certain age. - So, we've had sex a couple of times and I thought it was great 'cause it didn't hurt and I've give him a couple blow jobs. - All at the same time? - Oh yeah, he got a good deal and was too good to pass up. - [Sazerac] A steal's a steal. - And I get this wild and crazy thought that I might just want him to do the same thing to me. One night my mom isn't home and he comes over, puts on his minor's hat. - Please tell me he actually did that. - Can I tell the fucking story? - Sorry. - And he descended into the abyss. Let's just say, he tried his very best, but he did not strike gold. - You did not exclaim Eureka. (Zelzah giggling) - He got so frustrated and yelled that I, I don't know that it was all my fault. I was a slut for wanting it, but also that, something was wrong with me for not liking it. And my mom came home. She was just so shocked. I don't think she realized that I was having sex yet. Just so fucking shocked. And she yelled at me too. (soft music) That really fucked me up for a long time. (soft music) This is where my mama grew up. - What happened? - People move. Then other people come and take the bricks. I mean, they're places like this all over the north side. (whirring traffic) - I bet it used to be so beautiful. - It still is. It's just different. I'm gonna do something with this, someday. Do you think you love me more? - [Sazerac] I hell fucking yeah I do. - Bullshit. I totally love you more and I know that. - Oh yeah? Prove it. - [Sazerac] Now who loves you more? - The Guide Dog Association. How's Ally? - She's good. Finishing up culinary school. Pastrying it up at the patisserie. - Is she happy? - I think so. Seems like she found herself. - [Sazerac] That's great. - [Zelzah] Yeah. - Oh, I keep forgetting to tell you. Do you remember that young couple lived a couple doors down? - [Zelzah] The Bosnian one? - No. Korean guy in (indistinct). - Oh yeah. - Yeah, I ran into the Korean guy in New York. - [Zelzah] What? - [Sazerac] Yeah, yeah we were at a party and St. Louis came up. I was like, "I used to live off Kings Highway". He said, "Me too on Lawn". I was like, "No fucking way, wait". - [Zelzah] What and you remembered each other? - [Sazerac] Kinda. I remembered their setup in (indistinct). - Huh. And where's she at? - [Sazerac] Don't know. They'd broken up. - Babe. What-? - Fine. Please just go back to your party. - [Zelzah] Our party. - [Sazerac] Sure, sure. - [Zelzah] What? - I just can't. Okay? So you should go have some fun. - Please, talk to me, please. Sazerac, I can't help- - Well, maybe you just can't fucking help. Okay? (soft music) - What the fuck did I do that was so wrong? - You didn't do anything. I mean, to get me in this state, but in this moment. - Trying to help, that's what the fuck my problem is? - Fine. You wanna know? - Yes, I fucking wanna know. - You've had this whole life without me. - What? - You've been on this planet for 34 years and I didn't know any of that. All of your friends, they have their own lives. Denise was in Afghanistan. Tiffany lost a baby. How do you even exist after that? All of this stuff has happened and it will continue to happen after all of this. - After all of what? - You'll have a whole life after we're over. - [Zelzah] Maybe there won't be an after us? - There will. There always is. How can two people love each other when they're 36, still love each other when they're 63? - Don't let your anxiety get ahold of you. Push it the fuck away. (Sazerac sobbing) All know is, saying it's too hard now, because it might be too hard later is bullshit. - [Sazerac] I know. - Why do you care? - I care. It's just. - Why can't you just drop the stuff that we don't know, you know? (soft music) I know it's silly, but, I think the city is one of the greats. All it is. All it can be. All it was. All I wish it weren't. - You ever think about what you would've done differently? I know I shouldn't ask that question. - No, it's okay. Yeah, there's stuff yeah. - Like what? - [Zelzah] You go first. - There's just a lot that I'm sorry about. A lot I didn't do. A lot I did. - The dos you did could have been worse. - And the didn't I didn't? - No. That could have been better. It wasn't all you, you know? - I know. Or I'd hoped. But the you part of it, if you'd done the exact same shit, but I had been better, we could have found a way through it. Let's say we flipped it. I don't think there was any more that you could have done to see us through my shit. - The fact that you, (Zelzah sniffling) that means a lot. Thank you. - Hasn't been too heavy on you has it? - A little bit. Trying to figure out my part in things. What was really me and what just felt like me. How to grow, what to change, what to keep. - I hope there's a lot you're keeping. (soft music) - [Zelzah] What if we tried something? - I told you, those (indistinct) strap on's chafe. - [Zelzah] Not like that. But also like nothing I've done for you chafes. What I'm saying is, in the future, when we feel a fight coming on, what if we try one of those cooler heads prevail kind of things, where one of us picks up an invisible telephone and calls the big bad wolf and then the other one answers as the big bad wolf. And the first person lays out all their stuff to this neutral third party. - [Sazerac] The big bad wolf. - [Zelzah] Yeah. - I mean, can't hurt to try. Isn't it a little cold for? - Trust me. - It's so fucking good. How is it so good? - I worked here when I was in high school. I still don't know. - I had no idea this was a part of your life. - I know, right? I would've thought it would've come up. Maybe it did. - What do you mean? - Well, I was just reading something. I don't remember where. - Of course. - About how memory is really more a creation. Like, say you're thinking of an old picture when you were a kid. It's not like that picture is stored somewhere deep in your memory bank. But each time you're like, okay, let me think about that picture. You're actually recreating that picture. - Fuck so what, it's kind of like paint by numbers? There's a blueprint of how it's supposed to be each time. That's why some memories feel the same every time. - I guess so. But it's also how the memories are different. Maybe like building a puzzle, where occasionally you lose a piece and the other pieces have to smoosh in to fill in the gaps. - If you're right, then how can you trust anything? - But what I like about it though, is that it makes us the artist of our own path, which in turn makes us- - Artist of our future as well. Yeah. - Yeah. Is something up? - [Sazerac] No. - [Zelzah] Seriously? - [Sazerac] I'm just feeling off. - Does it have anything to do with your stepdad? - I wish I hadn't told you that. Sometimes I feel shitty because I feel shitty. Not because I was conditioned by a fucking alcoholic. - Of course. And we'll figure it- - It's not a figuring out thing. I just feel empty and that's that. - I mean, you haven't been sleeping well lately. - I don't say anything and you get upset. I say something and you get upset. - I'm not saying it's only that, but sleep, food, and water about those... - [Sazerac] Such a fucking expert. - Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Is the big bad wolf home? - You know I actually have to stop by the gallery. Do you wanna come with, or I could just..? - Nah, I'll, let's do it. What? - Have you seen anyone since? - Are you really asking me that? - [Sazerac] I don't have to be if you don't want me to. - I mean, do you wanna know? - And that sounds like a yes. - [Zelzah] It is. How's that feel? - I mean, fair, but not great. - Good. - Good. - I mean, (Zelzah sighing) I don't know. Part of me still wants to hurt you and then I feel bad for hurting you. You see anyone? - Nope. - Why not? - I haven't met anyone I like as much as I like you. - Well, that's too bad 'cause I met a bunch of guys who I liked better. Oh, I'm kidding. Come on. That was a little funny. - Maybe I should just walk. - If you want. - I don't want. - [Zelzah] Yeah. - Normally I'd be against like a plumb and an apricot getting in bed together. But when the baby is as fun to say as pluot, I am on board. Say it with me. Pluot. Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe. - Pluot. - No. Say it with joy. - Sorry, look the Cubs are up three and the eighth. Can we watch the end of the game? - You say it's stresses you out when they play the cubbies. - If we watch the end of this game, I will say pluot with all of the joy you can stand. - Don't you trade sex for baseball? - What? Happens all the time. That's what Field of Dreams is about. Is there any other way to interpret if you build it, they will come. (gentle music) - Fine. Fine. (Zelzah laughing) Let's go watch a big bird destroy a little bear. - Yeah. (soft music) - This was why I didn't wanna watch the cards game. Who lets off a walk off Grand Slam to the fucking Cubs? They should have fucking done better. - Yeah, I know. Let's just go home, okay? - They fucked it up. - Yeah, they fucked it up. (soft music) - Can we just go home already? - Open your eyes. I love you. - [Zelzah] It's beautiful. - What the fuck is it about? - I wouldn't have added the fuck, but yes. I mean, okay, I spend a few minutes with a piece, maybe an hour, if I'm really enthralled. But you worked on this piece the entire time that we were together. - It's not as cut and dry as that, swipe there talks about my issues with my dad, or that swoop represents my thoughts on what really happened on 9/11. For me, painting is when I feel calm, I like to think that it's when I get out of the way and the universe comes through me. You pick up some of that alchemy, add some of your own stuff. - So, you spend a minute with it now, but maybe it finds a home in my soul and it's with me for longer than the time you spent painting it? - Hopefully. I send it out in the world and I don't know if it's meaning anything to anyone. I want to believe that it sends a report back, even if I don't know the person, or when the person is. - What, like Emily Dickinson felt the imprint of her work, even though she wasn't alive when it was read? - I wanna believe that anyways. It's fuel to keep you going. On those days when she was like, why the fuck am I doing this? Whatever the oomph is that gives her the push in the present, is the reverberations of joy that you experienced when you read her poetry yesterday. (people chattering in the background) - I hope you're right, because that really sounds nice. - [Sazerac] See that flower right there? Boom. That's God. - So, if I crush that sucker, no more creator. - [Sazerac] You toppling the kingdom. No, but that lady's beautiful. Full of grace. - I see the grace. Why is God gotta be a part of it? - Just is. - I don't know. I mean, if people can be good without God, why we need God? I mean, plenty of people who shine in God's light, do so with hatred. - I'm talking about God. You're talking about religion. Actually it's different. In the past, so much of a person's inner life was in concert with God. So much of art as well. Now we don't really have that. Do you honestly think that we're better off? - [Zelzah] Okay. What do you mean when you say God? - I don't know. But there's something out there. Something here that connects all of us, that shines down on all of us. - I don't feel God's shine. So, I'd rather believe there's no light at all, than that she just chose not to aim it at me. - It never really shines on me neither. But, I still like to believe it's out there. (gentle music) - [Zelzah] You wanna go there? - [Sazerac] Yeah, sure. - - [Zelzah] Well? - Fuck you remember when? - Oh, we are not dancing on the table. - I think there was more of you trying your damnedest to fall off the table and me trying mine to keep you on. - Is that not what dancing is? (Sazerac laughing) You know when you have a thing of string and you turn it the wrong way and it just splits and uncoils and then becomes a fucking mess? - I'm sorry. - Don't be, it's good. I'm glad you're here. I just wanted you to know. - Shall we get drunk? - Please. (glasses clinking) You were right. That club would've been too much. Everything feels like it's at its full potential. The couch is at the apex of its softness. - [Sazerac] All you need is a couch. - All you need is a couch. - [Sazerac] What? - [Zelzah] I was just agreeing with you. - Cool. - I just had a crazy thought. What if we went home? (Zelzah laughing) - [Zelzah] All right. I know we're high, but that is some real high top. We are home. - No, home, home. - Babe. You can't fly back to Long Island right now. I don't think they land on your street. - I mean, I think I wanna move back home. - For what, like a while? - I want you to come with me. - But your home's not home for me. - It could be. - Or, you could be home right here. - Could be. But it isn't. - [Zelzah] Maybe you won't let it be. - [Sazerac] Whatever the reason why it isn't home, doesn't change the fact that it isn't. - Well, maybe if you change the why, you could change the isn't. But I guess you don't wanna try, huh? - I can't feel home. - I don't think that's a here thing. I think that's a here thing. We can fix you up right here. Good as new. - We haven't been able to so far. - I can, if you let me do it the way I wanna. Give me three months, do everything exactly how I tell you. I'll even pray to your flower God, I can get your mind right. - [Sazerac] If you could have done it by now, you would've. - I have tried so hard. (Zelzah sobbing) - [Sazerac] No, no. No. It's not can you fix anything. It's a can I be fixed thing? In whichever here it is, as of now. It's no. - I need you. (dramatic music) (Zelzah sobbing) - Oh my God, we just about shut this place down. Where do you want to go next? - You're my guide. You don't hear Virgil being like, yo, Dante, we're gonna spin around purgatory next, or what? - Oh, so you're saying we're in hell are you? - You know what I meant. - Sorry I didn't do this in rhyme. - We just did glutton the shit out of this place. - We barely ate anything. Where we need to go to- - Stop it. Stop. - What? - Stop it. Stop. - You gotta go? - I don't have to go. - You wanna see the old place? - Is it a mess? It's gonna kill me if it's a mess. - Mess is relative. - I'll just close my eyes. - Then you'll trip over everything. (Zelzah and Sazerac laughing) Everyone leaves. I know that. It's fine. - What do you mean? - It's what humans are designed to do. Leave. - [Sazerac] You can't honestly think that. - What the fuck are you doing? - [Sazerac] I mean, yeah. - Fine. Everybody I care about leaves. - [Sazerac] Who left? - She died. - [Sazerac] Your mom? I doubt that was her intent. - I'm not saying she did it on purpose, but she did. I wasn't ready. - [Sazerac] You ever think you would have been? - No, but I hate that my kids are never gonna know the most important person in my life. - [Sazerac] To love you. - Then they'll be fucked. - [Sazerac] I think they might even be better off than you were. - Well then I'll die and then I'll be fucked. - [Sazerac] Yeah. But everything before that will be worth it. (door softly closing) (gentle music) (Zelzah sobbing) - [Zelzah] What do you think? - Looks mostly how I remembered it. - [Zelzah] Good mostly, or bad mostly? - [Sazerac] Only good mostly. (seductive music) - [Sazerac] So, the Yard Institute offered me down. - From New York to St. Louis, that's gonna be one hell of a commute. (Sazerac laughing) - [Sazerac] It probably makes sense just to crash here. - In St Louis? - [Sazerac] I mean more crashing here, here. Here, here. - Oh. - [Sazerac] Oh? - No, I mean... - [Sazerac] Wait. Me not being in St. Louis, that was our big problem last time, right? - [Zelzah] I think that's what we told ourselves was our big problem. - Wait a fucking second. What are you saying? - What are you saying? That you wanna get back together? - Of course that's what I'm saying. That's what today was. - I thought it was a nice goodbye. - What do you mean a nice goodbye? Me coming back here. What did you think would, what did you want to happen? - I don't know. - You do know. - Well, I didn't think you wanted to get back together. - You just wanted a last, you know. - I thought we were on the same page. - Same page, different fucking books. - [Zelzah] I'm sorry. - [Sazerac] Me too. - I'm not saying we weren't good together. - [Sazerac] Then what are you saying? - Maybe I'm not the one for you and maybe you're not the one for me. And maybe that's okay, that we had something really fucking special and that's more than enough. - I don't just wanna leave it there. - [Zelzah] I think the timing just didn't line up. - But I'm better. I'm going to therapy. - Going? - Gone. - More than once? - I didn't like the guy, but I'm looking for another. - [Zelzah] I'm proud of you for trying it. I know that couldn't have been easy. - Look, I know I just tossed this in your lap. I get it. Of course I can't move in here. That was unfair of me. It'll take time to build things back up. - I am building things back up. - Me too. That's what this is. - I don't think your stuff should be based on me. - I guess yours isn't on me, huh? - It's not an on you, or not on you thing. It's an on me thing. - I know I had a hard time letting you in before, but I'm ready for it. - Me to take care of you? - Don't say it like that. - I don't mean for it to hurt you. It is what I wanted back then. - Bullshit back then. It was a year ago. - I'm trying, okay? I'm trying to be better. - Then let's try together. Look how I've grown in a year. Can you imagine the old me coming to you this open? - I honestly can't. And I am happy for you and proud of you, but we are not on the same trip. - So, you're on this growing journey. But what happens if you don't end up where you wanna go and you slide back into being you? Then you could have missed this amazing thing we have. Why not try both? - You're right. I'm not there yet and I don't know if I'll get there and if I don't and I threw away all that we had, I will be devastated. But this is the first time I am focused on me, and I feel like that's probably something I need to do alone. - Do you ever feel like your whole life is hanging on a moment? And if you don't do it right, then everything thereafter is just, please, I need you. - Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Ring ring. - Big bad wolf speaking. - Hello Mr. Wolf. - Oh, Mr. Wolf. That was my father. You can call me big bad. How can I help you? - There's this guy, who I love more than I have ever loved anyone, and he's asking me this question. Every time he asks me, it gets harder and harder to breathe. I don't think he realizes, that say no to him is killing me. If he asks me again, I'll say yes and I'll be able to breathe for a moment, but that yes is gonna drown me. - Even if you love him? - No. Because I love him. I wish the timing didn't work this way, but I can't take care of him until I fix me. And I can't fix the bus and drive it at the same time. - You want me to tell this guy all that? - No. Just ask him what matters more to him, loving me, or being loved by me? (gentle music) (door gently closing) (Zelzah exhaling) - Okay. (smooth music)
