Do not re-post this subtitle! This subtitle is free. And ok to translate. Ow! Huh? It's not that funny. Hi guys! Sorry I'm late. Huh? It looks like you wearing an apartment on your back. My mom said I had to come prepared. Well, she may be right about that. But did she ever consider how it might make you look? What did you pack in that enormous thing? Hopefully a microwave. No. But mom did pack all kinds of other stuff. Like my school work, I'm supposed to catch up on. Science, math, social studies. Oh, and this weird machine that's supposed to make me smarter while I'm sleeping. Let's see what else do I have in here? A desk lamp, can food, flashlights, bug spray, shampoo, a fan, some pots and pans, a night light, a PDA, chopsticks, chewable vitamins, toilet paper, aspirin, bandages... Oh, those are for you Oolong. And let me open this other section. Zzz. Zzz. Uh? Ah! Bulma! Ah? Aah! The whole forest is on fire! We've got to stop it! Woah! Gohan, do you think you can power up here? - Right now? - Yes! Do it! Err! ‎ ‎ Err! Haa! Haaa! Haa! ‎ Haa! Haaa! Haaa! ‎ Haa! Yrrrrra! Yrrrrra! There, now you're free to fly away. Haaa! ‎ Haaa! Haa! Haaa! ‎ Aah! It's all gone. Where are all the animals gonna live? So uh, what now? I wish there was something we could do to help. Humm... Poor little guy. This stinks. Hey! Bulma! Do you think your dragon radar is charged up? Ah!? Why didn't I think of that? - You mean? - Mm-hmm. Yeah! We've got a lot of work ahead of us. Well, I'm ready when you are. Subtitles by: MightyMike77020. Dragon ball² Z (1990) Tree Of Might WAAH! STOP! WAIT! HE'S NOT GOING TO HURT US! ROAR! ROAR! Hold on! He's a really nice dragon. And we called him here to rebuild the whole forest. Alright? HMMM... I don't blame him. I wouldn't wanna see that face in a dark alley or a well-lit police station for that matter. ROAR! SPEAK! WHY HAVE YOU SUMMONED ME AT THIS TIME? Please restore the forest and make it as beautiful as it was before. IT SHALL BE DONE. Aw. YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED. THE FOREST IS RESTORED. FAREWELL. You know, I'm still having trouble figuring out what to name you. Uh... how about Icarus. Oh, you like that name do you? Alright. Aw, earth, the perfect planet for The Tree Of Might. It's crawling with life. It seems Kakarot has not been doing his job. Perhaps he perished when simply a mere child. Nonsense, he is a Saiyan. Saiyan's never perish. Hmm? Yes, look at that, power reading. Kakarot is on earth for sure. We just don't know where yet. Are you sure it's not too hot in there Goku? Na, the heat loosens sore muscles. Daddy, I bet I can hold my breath longer. Oh yeah! Huh? Grr! Ahh! Goku! get out of there! Hey, no fair! Huh? Err! Err! Icarus! It's a monster! No mom, this is Icarus, my new friend. Friends are usually human, Gohan. Huh? So, do you like him? Big. Gohan I have had it! What were you thinking bringing that thing home!? I figured you knew better than that. You've been hanging around your father's friends too long. Gallivanting around the world and not studying! Go easy on the boy, Chi-Chi. Zip it Goku, your next. And in case you've forgotten you and your pals are the reason he does things like this. I'll be better from now on mom, promise. Good because we need a lawyer in the family, Gohan. You know Icarus is an outdoor dragon. He won't come inside. Well, you're off to a good start. But you still have to take him back to his home. Someone might be missing him. But mom! Don't talk back to me young man! Take him home now! Mmm. C'mon Icarus you heard her. I gotta take you back home. Now move it. C'mon. All right fine. Don't be mad at me. I wanted to keep you. Oh. I'm sorry little fella. Gohan, over here. What do ya' think Gohan? This is great! Thanks, dad. No, stop it. So, what do you think of my new ride, Puar? - It's pretty sweet. - You'd better believe it. I bet Bulma would love to go for a cruise in this mean machine. Except that she still mad about you standing her up. Well, she'll forgive me the second she sets her pretty little eye on my stick new ride. I just can't wait to see the look on her face. Yeah, me too. Huh? What is it? Something's not right. I sense an evil energy in the air. As if darkness approaches. Ah, there's the spot our tree you will grow. Uh~~~. Uhh! Ahhh! It's ok! It's ok! Minor damage. It won't be long now. We simply wait for the foot. Some behind the horns. Gohan your lunch is getting cold. K'. I gotta go, I don't wanna get in trouble. See ya'! Hmm? Earth is proving to be the ideal environment for The Tree Of Might. Soon the fruit will blossom and we will reap what we have sown. We can finally set this planet right. Sorry about your new cruiser, Yamcha. Yeah, I didn't even have insurance for the thing. Hope it wasn't expensive. Uh, well kinda. I pretty much spend everything I had. What! Why'd you blow a bunch of cash on a car, huh!? Trying to impress all the ladies I assume! - Well, uh, my other car died, I had to you know. - So you think your friendly stars, and fast cars are going to get you, girls? - No. - You're wrong! I'd just... There's nothing wrong with a little showing off. Well, men will be men. I learned that a long time ago. As long as being around them doesn't distract Gohan from his studies. Come on! I could totally help Gohan with his schoolwork. That's exactly what I'm afraid of. Uhh. And thanks a lot, you guys. Icarus no! Gohan, I thought I told you to get rid of that thing. He had to... uh... Um... Uh... he's just a lonely dragon. What! Goku, please tell me this wasn't all your idea. Uh... pets are character building. You have to go away. I'm getting in trouble. What do you want? Gohan, you get in here this instant! I'm not finished with you yet young man! I'm coming! Icarus! I can't play! No! I'll be grounded if you stay here! Now go! The little fella seems bothered by something. He's not the only one. Goku! King Kai, is that you? Yes! And you must know, an awful thing has taken place. What kind of thing? A wicked tree called The Tree Of Might, has planted a seed and taking root on your planet. Tree Of Might sounds serious. Its fruit was originally intended only for The Eternal Dragon. The tree has also been known as The Tree Of Death. Because it burrows far beneath the surface to find the nutrients it needs to bear fruit. If it is allowed to grow, it will feed on the soil sucking out everything it would need to survive. And the fruit would be rich beyond imagination. We must stop it from bearing this fruit. Why would we have to do that? It takes so many nutrients and so much energy to produce this fruit that everything the tree touches is destroyed. If this process is not stopped immediately the tree will suck all that it needs from the earth and she will be left as nothing but a wasted and depleted desert. I refuse to let that happen. Huh? Then you must go and face the warriors who planted the seed. I'll show them not to mess with my home! It won't be long until the fruit is ripe. And after that, no one will be able to stop Turles. Once he eats the fruit his power will be off the chart. Not that Turles needs more strength to battle Kakarot. The poor weakling couldn't even conquer earth. All of our powers will grow. We'll out shadow every fighter in the known universe. The first thing is to wipe out this filthy planet. Don't worry, from what I've seen that won't be very difficult. Yes. You men focus on that. Leave the weak excuse of a Saiyan to me. But none of this makes any sense. Yeah, what kind of tree is it? It's time we all gather together and fight as one. Sounds great to me, Goku. It should only take us a day or 2 to get ready. No. We'll put an end to this today. And make sure it doesn't happen again. Well, I'm with you. Come on! Who's in?! We are! - Me too. -Let's go! - Let's fight! Gohan, just what do you think you doing? Uuh... Uuh... Mom, come on, please? That thing's enormous. If you want to do any significant damage we need to start attacking at the trunk. Ready, power up! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Huh? Aah! Come on Goku, let's hit that thing again. Well, hold on a second. If we do, will end up destroying everything else around the tree instead. What pitiful losers. You actually think you can destroy The Tree Of Might? Their energy level is amazingly high. But I don't know where they came from. You put this tree on our planet. But you never asked. Personally, I think it makes the forest look better. It can stand as the lone pillar of strength on this planet. I bet it was you guys that cause that big explosion. The one that destroyed my new cruiser. Right. These guys don't look scary at all. I'm just shaking because there's a draft up here. Oh, he's not here. I hope you didn't take it the wrong way when I got upset earlier. I wish I had played with him more often when I had the chance to. Hey, Icarus you're still here! You're gonna pay for my busted cruiser. Chiaotzu fire! Aah! Aah!~~~. Rasin and Lakasei. Solar flare! Ha. Destructo!.. Disc! So, I guess we're already up to the fancy moves. Huh? No. You want some of this? Huhyah! Eat that! He had his chance. Now try this! We're not done yet, little clown. Who did that! I did! And you better stop messing with my friends! Just my luck. Stuck babysitting again. Yaah! The child's ability is shocking. Could he be a Saiyan? He is. I think it's time someone gave you a good spanking, kid. Yeaaah! Masenko!~~~ aah! Hiyaa! That kids' power he reminds me of a... Wha..? Where did he go? Right behind you! Haa! Aah! Yeah! Kakarot's son. Of course he is. Oh man, where did Icarus go? He's gotta be around here somewhere. Icarus. Come on out boy. I hope he didn't run into any trouble. Huh? He looks like... Well, it's you. The mighty son of Kakarot. Huh? Hey! You're not my father! You recognize that I resemble your father. We are both Saiyan warriors struck from the same mold. Built for destruction. Hmm. Your power level is massive. You truly are a Saiyan warrior. If you were to join up with me we could rule the universe together. Who are you!? I am Turles. Mightiest of the Saiyan warriors. No! No you're not! Your father is a weak and feeble Saiyan. No, he's not! We sent him to destroy the earth and he failed. You can never learn to be a true warrior under his guidance. Show me you are smarter and join me. The Tree Of Might will leave earth withered up and dry. There will be nothing left here for you. Come with me and we will conquer new worlds. Not even if you were my father! You see... Anger increases your strength. You're just the kind of Saiyan I could use on my team. Unless you're opposed. Aah! The tree continues to grow. and as it does the rich fruit will ripen quickly, and soon after the earth will know... It's end. - So you better make up your mind! - Aah! Something's coming, and its power level is unreadable. Who's there? What are you supposed to be? Yeah! Mr. Piccolo! I'm everything you fear. Stop it you're scaring me. Let the boy go! Haa! Ha, that was close. - You ok kid? - Yeah I think so. Yes, you can feel the same Saiyan blood I have rushing through your veins. Don't deny it. You can feel the power behind the pain. There it is. The Saiyan tail, just as I thought, and since you don't want to play by my rules. What do you say we have a little fun instead. A true Saiyan transforms under any full moon. Moon blast... explode! That's it, get a good eyeful, let's see that monster inside. The blocking cloud will stop me from seeing the fake moon. As for the Saiyan child, I'd say, it's already much too late. I mean, the younger apes are much more violent than the older ones. I think you should worry about yourself. Like that! Try this one. Yaaah! Gohan! Gohan! It's daddy! Beaten up by your own son huh, Kakarot? You might be a sad warrior but I will give you the respect of the Saiyan. And take care of your son when you're dead. WE'VE GOT TO CUT OFF HIS TAIL! Piccolo! That it! Your time is over! Gohan! Gohan! Huh? Now squash him like a bug on the kitchen floor. Huh? Disturbing. The strongest of all Saiyan blood and he has a soft spot for a purple dinosaur. Kakarot you raised this Saiyan too much like an earthling. I've raised him to know the difference between good and evil. Unlike some people. I know the difference I just don't care. Good work. Bring the whole cavern crashing down around you. All right then, come and get me! It's always a shame to lose a Saiyan. Especially when they turn out to be as weak and kindhearted as you and your father. Take that! No! Gotcha. Dead, you caught me. There was a big monkey and he started smashing into things. Gohan! You did a good job today. And now it's time for daddy to take over. Did you hear what I said! I'm done playing games! This ends now! Uh? Kakarot, you are a disgrace to your people. Thousands of years of evolution and you cast it aside for a multitude of weaklings. Mighty Turles, leave him to us. We've already made short work of your friends. Actually, I wouldn't call it work at all. We expected more from all of you. You should have left my son out of this. Why don't you put your money where your mouth is. This isn't a spectator's sport. Haa! Yaah! How does it feel being beaten? Kakarot, I'll give you an out. I know you're a coward, so should you choose there's still time for you to surrender. I promise I won't tell. Not a chance! I will never surrender! But I'm going to destroy you, haven't to put that together yet? I'm absolutely your superior. I'll enjoy beating you, just like I beat your son. You'll be sorry you ever laid a hand on my son! Even now, The Tree Of Might is draining the energy from your planet. Sucking the land dry. Ripening its fruit for me. Once I eat it, I'll be unstoppable! Keep on dreaming! 'Cause that will never happen with me around! You haven't been able to stop me so far. That was a cheap shot. It won't happen again. You thought I was strong before, watch this. With this fruit, I'll become the most powerful warrior this universe has ever seen. And every living creature will come to know the name Turles as their ruler. From this point on, nothing can stop me. Not even Kakarot. Stay down you weakening. It's useless to try and fight against me. Now... Kaio-Ken times 20! Now Kakarot, if you want to live you must kneel and beg forgiveness. I... I don't know any Kakarot. That's... not my name. Don't you lie to me. My name is Goku! Goku! Then die here! fool! When are you going to get it? I can't be beat. If you were smarter... You would have just followed orders and destroyed this puny planet from the beginning. Goku, you have to keep fighting. Get up. Please, your our only hope. Piccolo. Yamcha. I feel too weak. I can't even move. Please Goku, remember us. We're your friends. We're with you Goku. Oh. I'm sorry. We are with you Goku. Dad, I know you can do it. Gohan. I can't quit. Must... stand up. Oh... Back for more. MightyMike77020 My pleasure. Goku, listen to me. The strong. But he's not unbeatable. Nothing is. You can do this. I - must - go - on - for - Gohan and the others. I just can't let them down. Get your strength. From the planet. I have to. EARTH GIVE ME POWER! Kakarot? BRING IT ON! Soon earth will be at my mercy and there will be no one left to stop me. And, thank you. Huh? It can't be. TAKE THIS TURLES! A GIFT FROM THE EARTH! No, there just wasn't enough energy left in the earth. It was all absorbed by The Tree Of Might. And now we're finished. No, I thought we'd make it. And I still have another piece of fruit left in case of emergency. Huh? What is that? It's warm, like the rays of the sun. That's it! If he can just reach that fruit from The Tree Of Might. He could grow strong again. I have to stay focused on the energy from the fruit. Mmm. Turles! Huh? Not you again! How did this happen? I have the power of nature inside. Haa! Yaa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Huh? Oh. Icarus! You're alive! That Tree Of Might has been destroyed. And the earth will live on. Goku drew power from the tree and use its own energy against it. Destroying it and destroying the mighty Turles. By now all of the power that was absorbed has been returned to its source. Goku had the courage to stand up to a fearsome threat. And by doing this he freed up the energy from the tree. It is the release of this pure energy. That restored balance back to the beautiful earth. It's a good thing you finally came around at the end, Goku. For a minute you had us all worried sick. That's true. But you fight like you're in a dancing contest. Is it too much to ask that you just use your dukes and punch it out? You always did tell me that fighting with my head is what wins the battle. You did a really good job back there Icarus, I guess you're part of the group now. So I have to ask, do you mind if I pet ya'? Rroow! That's great! He's just like Piccolo! Everything for Gohan nothing for me. I figured a dragon would like pork. Humph.
