Good. Use your mind's eye. Try to imagine that you are inside an elevator. You are on the floor that corresponds to your present age. Now look to the line of numbered buttons on the wall. They represent your present and past. There are other buttons too, that have no labels. Sometimes the floors can go further back to before you can remember. Pick one of those buttons. (big band music playing faintly) (woman chuckling) - What're you laughing at, girl? - Wilford Charles, you're such a dreamer. - Lady, I wanna tell you, I promise you, mansions in Beverly Hills. How about a private jet, hmm? Limos. I'm gonna buy you nothing but the best of finest of clothes. Diamonds, I'm telling you, diamonds. And how about some of the French negligee? Huh? - [Woman] Hmmm. (lips smacking) Wilford, Wilford Charles, not here, not in the truck. - [Wilford] But I love you, dammit. - [Woman] Oh, oh, baby. (truck creaking) (crickets chirping) (woman moaning) (lips smacking) (signal warbling) - [Wilford] Oh baby! (sperms whining) - [Sperms] Me, me, me! (sperm squeaking) (lightning cracking) (rain sprinkling) (truck rumbling) (keys jingling) (baby cooing) - [Woman] Wilford! Wilford Charles! (baby crying) Stop that! Where is your father? (thunder rumbling) Wilford! (lightning cracking) (baby crying) Just shut up! Wilford! I've been gone for three days. You can't even take care of a little baby. (woman speaking indistinctly) (baby crying) (hand thudding) (wires crackling) (record crackling) Would you just shut up? (retro big band music) - [Wilford] Dear Thelma, you can scream and yell your wretched lungs out all you want, because it doesn't matter. I'm leaving you for good. I wanted to work- (paper crinkling) (record skipping) (baby crying) - Shut up! Shut up! Shh, shut up! Just shut up, you little brat, shut up, shut up! Shut up! Shut up! (baby crying) (woman weeping) (record skipping) (hand slapping) (music fading) (clock ticking) - You know, we're very fortunate this week. Your mother was very kind to bring in some of your most recent drawings, the ones before your trouble. (clock ticking) I thought that perhaps we might look at them and talk about them. Oh, now this one looks very interesting. You know, I've been told that you were once a very talented commercial artist. Are you one of the figures in this drawing? (ominous tonal synth music) It's a very busy drawing. It looks like a family picnic to me. Or maybe a camp out. Oh, this looks like a circus. It looks to be on the beach. (people bustling) (carnival music) (people screaming) (machine whirring) (crowd bustling) (muffled rock music) (playful carnival music) Oh, look at this part. They're cooking hot dogs over a fire. (fire crackling) (waves crashing) (men whooping) - Hey Crystal, want a wiener? (men laughing) (childish carnival music) (waves crashing) (man grunting) (man wailing) (bones crunching) (man groaning) (woman screaming) (man groaning) - Dr. Lang? - Oh, excuse me. - [Nurse] They're locking up now. - Jolene, you know better than to interrupt me during a session. If you have to, you could at least knock. - Sorry! - Shh. - You don't have to whisper. He doesn't know the difference. - I was trying to gain his confidence. - Right, well what do you want me to tell security? - Ah, I want you to tell them that I'll lock up when I'm finished, all right? - Okay. - Two hours. (door creaking) Oh, did someone give him his medication? - Yeah, about an hour ago. - Thank you. (door creaking) (clock ticking) (switch clicking) (ominous twinkling synth music) (zipper rasping) (fabric rustling) (ominous tonal synth music) I bet if you could talk, you'd tell me that you are really lonely. (clock ticking) (ominous tonal synth music continuing) (suspenseful string music) (machines slamming rhythmically) - [Newscaster] The attacker ripped off her t-shirt, held like a wild animal, then fled the scene on foot. The embarrassed, but otherwise uninjured woman went bare chested to a nearby residence where she phoned police. Hey, too bad she didn't stop by my place. I live near the beach. Just kidding. The incident fits the MO of other recent attacks, all involving the Foxy Lady novelty t-shirt. (sinister orchestral music) (keys jingling) (machine slamming rhythmically) (sinister orchestral music) (breakers clanking) (metal doors creaking) (sinister orchestral music resuming) - [Bill] Good morning. - Morning, Bill. - [Bill] Good morning. - Good morning. - [Bill] Good morning. - Mornin', Bill. - [Bill] Hey, Putts. - Good morning. - [Bill] Those mushroom shirts were all returned. See me in my office. Good morning. - [Worker #1] Good morning, Bill. - [Bill] Good morning. - [Worker #2] Good morning, Bill. - [Bill] Good morning. (shoes scuffing) - Morning, Bill. (man sighing) - [Bill] Same to you, buddy. (ominous tonal synth music) (distant objects thudding) - [Woman] Hey Mike. Come here, I wanna talk to you. Why can't you make artwork I can print? If you do your job right, I can make a lot of money around here, get it? Are you listening to me? - Yes, I'm listening. - Good. (body slamming) (heels clacking) (worker chattering distantly) (machines whirring) (doors creaking) (feet pattering) - Bill, Bill, open up! - [Bill] You know the rules. You have to go around through the front. - Aw, open up. (keys jingling) (cheesy upbeat synth music) - Hi Gary. - How's it going? - All right. - What're you printin' today? - Tennis players do it. What you doing? - I got mountain climbers. (machine rattling) (workers chattering) (water spritzing) - Where do you want these, DB? - [DB] I don't know. (water sloshing) (man sighing) (kettle whistling) (water dripping) (spatula scraping) - [Worker #1] When are you guys taking a lunch today? - [Worker #2] Right now. (machine whirring) (workers chattering) (tool scraping) (tool thunking) - [Man] Mornin'. Good morning. (coffee trickling) - Be a sweetheart. Run over to the bakery and pick me up at croissant? - Okay, but first I have to make a call. (cheesy synth pop music) (phone buzzing) - Hello? - How about a nice hot buttery croissant from the bakery? - No, Jennifer. - Well, I'm going over there anyway. And are you working late tonight? - [Man] No, bye. - Good, because I want you to go to this party with me- (receiver slamming) (woman gasping) Foxy Lady, Foxy Lady. (phone buzzing) Foxy Lady, Foxy Lady. (tools scraping) (tools thunking) (machines rattling) (ominous tonal music) (machine whirring) (water gushing) - Set it over here, I'll be done in a minute. You're going to a party tonight? Something's wrong? - I just don't want to be here. - Well, if you weren't here, you'd be somewhere else sweating like a pig. At least you're getting paid for doing what you like to do. The goal of your life and the pride of your mother. - I just wish I wasn't doing it on t-shirts. - [Man] Do it. - I only drew it, I didn't think it up. - Too bad, but take it easy, don't bring your bad vibe into my screen room. I've gotta know that crap from the B O. (workers chattering) (workers laughing) - I'm sorry Louis, I don't know what's wrong with me today. - Oh, that's all right. (knob clicking) (machine whirring) - Look at it this way. More people see t-shirt than see fine art. I bet more people for Foxy Lady and for Mona Lisa. Shit. And you think too much. Both of us are smarter than the rest of the zombie over there. (fly buzzing) It's only a matter of time before something better comes along. - Yeah, right. - How long have you been working here? - 3,142 Days. (Louis mumbling) - [Louis] That's eight years. (machine ratcheting) (machine whirring) (machine humming) (paper crinkling) (object clinking) - [Woman] Bill, I've got your yummies. - Just put it on my desk. - Testing, testing, is this damn thing on? Hey! Testing, testing, testing, testing. Okay, happy munchkins, we have a new tape today. I want everyone to listen and enjoy. (melancholy music) (tapedeck clicking) - [Tape] This is tape six of series one, "Success Motivation in the Workplace," a six-day repeat cycle. Good morning winners. (uplifting synth music) You are in control of your destiny. That's right. You are in command of your life and can become the man or woman of your dreams through the power of positive thinking. Success depends on it. Let us think about how positive thinking breeds success. Take a deep breath and clear your thoughts. - Jennifer, would you come here please? Take this to the back and have those guys come up with some new versions. Just have Greg do it. - [Tape] Let's think about it. - You made a mistake again. - What's wrong with it? [ [Woman] It's supposed to say chess. - [Tape] Some of the most practical success building- - Why'd you print so many of them? - [Woman] I don't know. - [Tape] Biblical quotation which states that faith can move mountains. - [Woman] You can talk to Jennifer. (man sighing) - [Tape] Not many people believe that they can move mountains, so as a result, not many people do. (heels clacking) Those who believe that they can move mountains, they do. - Oh, you've really have done yourself, Mike. - [Tape] Belief triggers the power to do so. - [Woman] Here, Bill wants couple variations. - [Tape] But you can't just wish a mountain away. You have to work at it. Let's think about it. (uplifting synth music) - I'm sure I could get Greg to do the artwork, if you'd go to the party with me tonight. (haunting childish music) Well? - If I pull my pants down, will you both pull your pants down? - Yeah! (girls giggling) - [Boy] Now it's your turn. - No! - [Boy] You creeps! No fair! (haunting synth music) - Well? (shirts thudding) - Uh, I thought Bill said I didn't have to do any more of those. (phone buzzing) (feet thudding) - [Tape] A one-armed man can juggle if he has the right attitude and doesn't resort to excuses. (receiver clanking) Let's think about it. - Yes? - What's your problem? - [Tape] Most of us make two basic errors- - [Mike] There's no problem. - [Bill] Well, I've got a problem. Three orders due today. How are you coming on those custom orders? - Um, they're under control. - Good, you've got a customer up here. - I gotta go up front. - [Tape] It matter not how much intelligence we have, but that we use what we have. Don't sell yourself short. It pays to think big. Think big, and you are big. Let's think about that. (cheesy synth jazz music) - Well, it's good you again, Mrs. Du It. - That's Miss. - Listen, I've got this great new idea for a t-shirt and I want you to work on it. I just love what you did with the last design we did together, but it really didn't sell that well. You know, I need to figure out why. I think maybe it's a little too esoteric, but this one, this one is a great one, I know you're gonna love it. Look at this. See? Chefs do it in hot oil. Get it? (woman laughing) It's a killer, isn't it? (woman laughing heartily) Isn't it a killer? (cheesy background music continuing) Well, what do you think? (Bill clearing throat) - Yes, I think it's a wonderful design. I think a lot of people will wanna wear those t-shirts. Very marketable. - Yeah, I thought so. See, I was thinking. Everybody can relate to food and eating and stuff like that. So I thought, you know, "chefs do it on the range," "cooks do it by the book," "bakers do it by the dozen." And then I thought oil, you know, oil like massage, like erotic, you know? And then hot oil, it's real sexual, but it's in the kitchen so it's clean, you know? So it's like the whole American hypocritical sex dream. (stomach gurgling) You know, like oil? Like cooking in oil? (stomach growling) So, how much is this gonna cost me? I mean, it's just a dumb drawing of a chef, right? With a few lines and a little bit of lettering and stuff like that. And it can't take much time. I know it wouldn't take you much time. And also my rent's due Tuesday. So, how much? - It'll cost about $50, um. (Bill clearing throat) $50, that is, for the positive. Burning the screen will cost- - 200 should cover it. - 200! - I'll take it from here. - [Woman] What's the matter with you guys? - I could do it if you'd give me a chance. - You go back and work on those custom orders. - Oh, those custom orders. - I'll be back to check on you in a minute. - You'll be back! (woman yammering) - I expect you to take the prices down. - Michael doesn't understand about contemporary pricing. - Hey, wait a minute. (both bickering distantly) - [Tape] Just think about how lucky you are to be the victors over unemployment. There is nothing magical and mystical about the power of believing in yourself. - Joni, you're still here. - What do you wanna do about these shirts? - [Tape] The I'm positive I can attitude- - Get rid of 'em. - [Tape] Generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do it. - Oh Joni, do it for me. - All right. - [Tape] Most people do not put much stock in such belief, but the residents of successful USA do. (Mike sighing) Let's think about it. (uplifting synth music) - Hi, Bill. - Hey, where are you going with those? - Mike told me to get rid of 'em. - What's wrong with them? - I can't believe it. - [Tape] For a moment, let us all silently recall- - I can't believe he screwed these up. - [Tape] Pleasant, positive experiences. - It's a dollar 12 a shirts, and it's gonna be $60. Go put those in my office. (feet clomping) - Hi Bill, I've gotta find Joni. - Wait a minute, Joni's busy, I sent her on errands. - [Tape] If a person thinks they are successful and happy- - [Jennifer] I guess you saw the shirts then, huh? - [Bill] Yeah, I saw 'em. Where do you think you're going? - [Tape] Believe, really believe. - Oh, I was just going to turn up the tape because Mike said he wanted it louder. - [Tape] Not wanting to believe in your own success is responsible for most failures. When a mind disbelieves or doubts, it attracts reasons and excuses- - Ow! - [Tape] To support the disbelief. (mite screeching) - Not that, you know what I want. - [Tape] Harness the power of positive thinking. - Oh Bill, not now, not here. - Here now. - [Tape] It's a form of psychological infection. - Someone will come. - No one's gonna come, just do it. - [Tape] Build your confidence- - All right. - [Tape] By destroying your fears of failure. The next big promotion- (fly unzipping) - [Tape] Depends on your confidence that you deserve that promotion. Let's remind ourselves that we are not pulled to high levels of success. Rather, we are lifted there by those working below and around us. Success depends not only on your belief, but also on the support of other people. Fellow workers, likability is your chief asset. (Bill panting) Exercise friendship, and you will achieve likability. Remember, if people don't like you, they won't support you. (Bill groaning) Let's think about it. (fly zipping) - All right if I go turn up the tape now? - [Tape] It really pays to think big in every way. If a person can imagine success, then they are one step closer to success. (uplifting synth music) Paint a picture in your mind of what you look like at the top. Stretch your vision. See what you can be instead of just what you are. Let's think long and hard about that. (electricity crackling) (speaker crackling) (wire thudding) - I'll do Foxy Lady. - [Bill] You think that's real funny, don't you? Maybe you like this sound better. Paul, move one of those jobs to the machine. Move mountain climbers do it with spiked shoes to the machine. (machine whirring) I'm gonna ask you just one more time, move it. - I don't think they want to move, Bill. - Bill, please don't make me design anymore of these. - Isn't that too bad? Hook up that speaker again. We're gonna listen to that whole tape from the beginning. - I'll do Foxy Lady. - I don't care who does it, just do it. Move it. - Move it. (ominous, dramatic synth music) (workers murmuring) - Come on. - Oh no, I'm quittin', I'm gettin' out of here. Come on, let's quit, what can he do? You know, we walk outta here- (workers murmuring) - [Bill] Move it. - Bill. The machine is ready, Bill. - Well then put it on. (electronics squeaking) (machine steaming) (machine clacking rhythmically) (haunting percussive synth music) (distorted voices speaking indistinctly) (bodies thudding) (shirts whooshing) (haunting music fading) (wind howling) (haunting echoes wailing) - Bill, I'm going home. I don't care, I don't care how it inconveniences you. I'm going home now, Bill. I don't know how you expect me to take it in there. I'm not feeling well. I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get outta here, Bill. Do you hear me, Bill? I'm gonna fuckin' go, do you hear me? I got some things to say to you and you're gonna listen to me for once, you got it? You got it straight? Hey, I'm not joking around this time. This time, I mean it. (smooth synth music) - What is it? - Uh, Bill, could I maybe go home? I don't feel so good. - What are you talking about? You can't go home. You didn't show up for work on Friday. You worked a half day Thursday and you weren't here at all on Wednesday. Mike, you're a lazy slug. You are personally responsible for slowing down production on this entire place. It's your fault we're missing our deadlines. - Please, Bill, I'm really sick. - I don't care if you're dying. Frankly, you've been screwing up a lot lately, and if you don't straighten up, you're gonna lose your commissions for an entire month. Look, Mike, you're a great artist. You're one of the best we've ever had around here. If you play your cards right, I can see to it that you stay in t-shirts for a long, long time. - Bill, (tragic string music) I think I deserve some kind of special attention on account of I worked here so long. I work Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays, and I'll work at home for you, and I don't ever complain or anything. I mean, I go all out when there's something that needs to be done fast, and one time, you know I needed some time off. I know you understand, you know I'm no complainer, but sometimes it just gets too much into me and you need some space or you'll just go crazy. (rat squeaking) Bill, I'm asking you for one day. I've worked here for eight years. One day, two days, three days. I'm talking about eight years. I've done a lot in eight years. I've done a lot of good things. (rat squeaking) Major business, big, quality. I don't think I'm asking for that much. I've done so much for you. I mean, I made this place partly what it is. So what's the big deal? What's the big wrap? (rat squeaking) Listen, Bill, I've been so loyal to this place. I can't imagine anyone working as hard as I do for the small wage that I do. So the least you could do for me is to let me have a little bit of time off. - No. (desk rattling) (haunting childish music) (ominous synth music) (metal racks creaking) - George? (heels clacking) (smooth jazz sax music) Where's George? - George isn't here. I left the note because I wanted to talk to you. - You know, you've really got your nerve, Jennifer. - What's wrong with me? - I'm in serious trouble for not working and you're wasting my time like this. - I try so hard to be a friend because I just wanna be close to you. I'd settle for just one kiss. (Jennifer yelping) (body thudding) I'm warning you, I wouldn't do it with you if you paid me. How humiliating. - This is real cute. Is this what I pay you three 40 an hour for? Usually I have a high tolerance for this kind of thing, but this time you've gone too far. I wanna see your progress on those custom orders. Let's go to the art room right now. - Okay, meet me at my desk. I gotta go to the bathroom first. - Those orders better be together. You miserable slimeball. If those orders aren't finished, you're finished. (door slamming) (fist thudding) (water trickling) (haunting tonal synth music) (papers rustling) - What does Mike do all day? Driving me crazy. I work my butt off up there taking these orders and nothing gets back here. (fist thumping) Mike? Mike, are you in there? (handle jiggling) (suspenseful synth music) (keys jingling) (water trickling) (melancholy harmonica music) (cat purring) (cans clinking) - [Man] Is someone out there? Help me man, pull on me, I'm stuck. I know I must look like an asshole to you right now, but, oh god, he's got a crowbar! Help me, man, help! Get me outta here. (man grunting) Argh, I quit, I quit! (man shouting distantly) Run, run! (helicopter whirring) (man panting) - You don't think that guy's gonna call the cops, do you? - My boss, not a chance, he's crazy. - What happened? - To tell you the truth, I don't even remember. But listen, thanks a lot. My name's Rod. - Yeah, I gotta go, Rod. Wait, listen, you really did me a favor. I'd like to do something for you. How about a drink? - Nah Rod, I don't want a drink. - No drink? Well wait. (Rod panting) Lunch then. I know just a great place to go. How about little lunch? - I'm not really hungry. - Well name it then what? - What would you like to do? - He says, "Listen, I've really got something, but I don't want these other two guys to see it." Well, the other two farmers get really mad now. They go over and they grab the suitcase, but the woman runs over there and she says, "I should get to see this first," and she rips open the suitcase and bounds the biggest, most huge, oh man, I'm sorry. Would you like another quarter? I don't have another quarter. - So what was in the suitcase, Rod? - [Rod] Uh, listen, you scared me, that got me. I dunno, I forgot, listen, how about that dinner? (video game music) (Rod laughing) Well that sounds like a fun job. - [Mike] It isn't. - [Rod] Well, as you can see, I dabble with the arts myself a little bit. (mellow sitar music) Well, I just can't find that thing anywhere. - What're you looking for? - A T-shirt that my daughter sent to me. Very funny shirt, you'd really like it. Well, I guess it's lost, but it was a great fun thing. (Rod chuckling) - [Mike] It's okay. - Well, cheers Mike. (Rod coughing) Mike, listen, I've got it. How would you like to go to a party with me tonight? (Mike laughing) (Rod laughing) - Tell you what, Rod, let me think about it. - [Rod] What's eating you, Mike? - A lot of things are eating me, Rod. - [Rod] Hmm, tell me about it. - You're not falling asleep, are you? - [Rod] No. - Did you ever do anything that you thought was gonna turn out real good only to have it explode in your face? - Sure, all the time. But be more specific. Give me some details and I'll visualize them in my brain. (Rod sighing) (mellow sitar music continuing) (ominous tonal music fading in) (water sloshing) (haunting twinkling music) - Shh. Well, what do you think? (indistinct) clearly ready. Don't worry about your clothes, this is going to be casual. Oh, you look so tired. - [Rod] Come on, let's go. Come on. (Rod grunting) (Rod chuckling) (distant rock music) So it's easy to meet new friends. You just be yourself. It's no different for you. - [Mike] Yeah, right. - [Rod] Mike? - [Mike] Hey there, little fella. (dog barking) (dog growling) - Dale, open the damn door. - Who's there? Go away, the wizard isn't home today. (dog growling) Get outta here. (dog howling) - Hey hey! - Hi Drew. - That's my neighbor's dog, a beagle. - Ah, a beagle, that would've been my first guess. (Rod chuckling) - Listen, say hello to Mike. Mike, this is Drew, this is Sylvia. (both chuckling) And Sheila. (all chuckling) - So Mike, what do you do? I mean, when you're not partying. - Yeah Mike, tell us. I draw. - I Drew. (all laughing) (Rod laughing) (doorbell ringing) But seriously, go get a beer. - See you later, Mike. - Who's there? (groovy rock music) - [Rod] Hey, come on. (partygoers chattering) Here she comes. - Would you get me a cookie please? - Sure. - Thanks. (cookie crunching) - I'm gonna go get a beer, would you like one? - Sure. - I'll be right back. - These people are really friendly. - Yeah, I noticed. (exciting rock music) All right, let's go dance. - Got a partner? You don't need a partner to dance, come on, let's go. - No, I don't think so. - Suit yourself. - This is my favorite song, come on, let's dance. - No, I don't wanna dance. - Oh come on, let's dance. - No, I don't wanna dance. ♪ Together we never change ♪ Forever the time slips away ♪ (indistinct) we're not sure ♪ The future is something that ♪ Ooh the fixture is the secret of the age ♪ ♪ Farther than nothing, nothing will care ♪ ♪ The dream doesn't matter ♪ For those that don't believe ♪ Push your seeds clearer ♪ The concepts (indistinct) ♪ Together we never today ♪ Forever the time slips away ♪ After the thunder is gone (beer sprinkling) (partygoers chuckling) - Wanna beer? - No thanks, I'd rather smoke. - Okay, how about you? - Just one sip. - Okay. (Rod chuckling) Hmm. - [Partygoer #1] I'd rather drink wine now than beer, actually. - [Partygoer #2] Yeah, I love flat beer. (upbeat reggae music) - Smoke the end down there. (woman giggling) ♪ Why don't you just smoke another step? ♪ - I'm hot, it's time to take this off. (zipper ratcheting) (Mike coughing) Take it easy. Take smaller puffs. I'll be right back. - Oh, Mike, hey listen. Hey, come on, et's get some fresh air. Let me get you outta here. (woman chuckling) - That guy's Jennifer's boyfriend. It's weird. - [Woman] You're kidding. (Mike coughing) - Oh, you really oughta do something about that cough, Michael. (Rod chuckling) - Very funny, very funny. Hey, what do you say we go? - Oh, you can't be serious, they're just getting started. What about that, you know, what's her name in there?

(upbeat pop music) - I am not winning with the girl. - You look lost, little boy. You wanna come home with me?

(partygoers chattering) - Hey Mike, hey Gary, let's get the beer. (rhythmic synth pop music) - [Man] And I've heard some really interesting things about carp lately, and you know, fish, they're just great. I mean, it's not like I've always, always been obsessed with fish my whole life. It's just something I've been getting interested in the last year. And I'm not all fish either. I mean, some are too big, you know? And some are too small, like goldfish. They're way, way too small. It's just, you know- - Larry, Larry, man, welcome Gary. Hey Gary, this is the guy I wanted you to meet. This is Mike, he created Foxy Lady. This is Larry, he works at Fantasy Shirts. - All right, a brother. - Anybody have an aspirin? - [Larry] I created this one. It's no Foxy Lady, but it did all right. - [Man] I did this one. - What a joke! (woman laughing) (men laughing) (man laughing) - Excuse me, I see my ride. - All right, listen, I'll be back in just a minute. Hey, Michael. - Hey Rod, I've been trying to find you. - Well, I've been trying to find you. Here, have a beer. - [Partygoer] Let's put on some music, huh? - Put on a record. - You sent those girls down to the pool, didn't you? - Girls? Are you loony, man? I didn't send any girls, I went to get the beer. So, you know, maybe it's been a few minutes. - But my head is splitting. Just get me outta here, I don't care where we go. - Listen, wait a minute, you've got a headache, I've got some friends right over here who've got just exactly what you're looking for. I'll be right back in the minute. - I just wanna leave. - Leave? - I have a splitting headache. I want to get outta here. - All right, all right. Here, will you hold this, sit down, relax a minute. I'll be right back, just give me a couple of minutes, I'll get a raincheck, all right? (dissonant distorted dance music) - [Partygoer] What happened to the music? (dog snarling) (dog barking) - Jennifer. - Hi. (woman chuckling) Nice dress. - Oh, so you finally admit it. - What's that weird music that's playing? - What's that on your shirt? - It's a sucker. - [Man] Jennifer, hey Jennifer! - Oh, it's Clarence. - See you later. - Clarence, come here. - [Clarence] I have something for you, here. - [Jennifer] What is it? - It's something special. Don't take all three at once. (dissonant distorted string music) (record creaking) (record snapping) (record pieces clacking) (heavy metal music) - [Drew] Mike, this is Crystal and Debbie. - Hi. - Hi. - [Drew] They wouldn't take no for an answer. (man grunting) - [Crystal] Just dance with me one time. - No, please, really. - [Crystal] Is your friend shy or what? - One dance never hurt anybody, Mike. (body thudding) (women giggling) - Jennifer. Hi, guess who's here. - Mike. (woman laughing) - Where? - Ooh, I think he's over there. (women laughing) (haunting music) (women laughing maniacally) (people laughing maniacally) - Jennifer! - Daddy! (woman laughing) (partygoers chattering) - Oh, psst. Oh my God. (women murmuring) - Jennifer, honey, what's wrong? - Talk to you later, daddy, okay? - Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, really. Here, let me help you. - Do you want to help? Leave me alone for a while. Even a minute would help. - I'll get you an ice pack, okay? - Find me some aspirin. - Aspirin, sure. Does anyone have any aspirin? Does anyone have any aspirin? (foil crinkling) (partergoers chattering) (upbeat rock music) - [Greg] How are you doing tonight? - Fine. - I could tell you an interesting story about that t-shirt. - Oh really? I got this in San Francisco. - Yeah, I know, I worked at the factory that makes them. I probably had my hands on that one at one time or another. - See that guy over there? He invented that for his girlfriend, a special personal gift, and she went and sold it to the factory that I work at and got him a 10 year contract. Anyway, she ended up leaving with one of the printers and all the royalties. - I couldn't find any aspirin, but here's some Tylenol. - Thank you. - Here, wash it down with this. (Mike gulping) (Mike panting) - Thanks. - You know, I'm real sorry for being so childish. It's just that I get a little jealous when I think of you with other women. And you know, when I think of what is and what could be. Cut it out, DB, cut it out! - And he got nothing but 10 years of watching that design printed every day. (Greg chuckling) - You think it's funny? I don't think it's funny. I think it's sad. - They're lighting the candles! (partygoers laughing) (partygoers chattering) (partygoers singing) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Drew ♪ Happy birthday to you (partygoers applauding) (partygoers cheering) (upbeat dance music) (haunting music) (air pumping) (distorted muffled murmuring) - Jennifer, get me a clamp. Hurry up with that clamp. (blood squishing) - [Man] Hey buddy, hey you. You probably don't remember me, do you? I'm Rod's ex-boss. That idiot doesn't know what planet he's on. Don't get your hopes up. I've overheard them say that it's hopeless. You haven't even a slim chance. And even if you had, it wouldn't matter. You're a goner. (man laughing maniacally) (shirts creaking) - [Bill] Jennifer! (shirts creaking) (man laughing maniacally) (air hissing) (shirts whooshing) (man laughing) (ominous tonal music) (man laughing fading) (suspenseful music) - Are you all right? Michael, what's wrong? - Nothing. - Here, let me help you up. - No, no. - Michael! (knees thumping) Michael! What is the problem? - I gotta find a bathroom. (dog snarling) - The bathroom's upstairs, I'll help you up, okay? - No, I'll get up myself. (haunting tonal synth music) (streamers rustling) (haunting twinkling music) (wind whistling) - Aw shit. Is that a rag? - Uh, sure. - Can I borrow it? - Yeah. - Oh wait, is this something you need to use? (suspenseful music) (carnival music) (door unlatching) (switch clicking) - What are you doing here? Get out. - You hypocrite. You make me sick. You're so sweet and such poison. - Don't blame your weird trips on me. Everything will be fine in the morning. - Morning? You put something in that aspirin. - Greg. Greg. - I'm gonna put you outta my misery. You screwed your last nut. The game's over. - It was just a little joke. - Joke? Is everything just a little joke to you? You're evil, cruel. You stink all over. - I never meant to hurt you. - Shut up, I don't wanna hear anymore of your crap. I should have done this eight years ago. - I love you. (suspenseful music growing) (club thudding) (waterbed sloshing) - Is this how you get your jollies? (club thudding) (clock chiming) (clock ticking) (melancholic string music) (woman grunting) (wheelchair rattling) - There. You know, maybe someone will come and visit you tomorrow. Sweet dreams. (lips smacking) Oh look, somebody remembered your birthday. It's late. Jolene can open it tomorrow. Good night. (haunting synth music) - [Rod] Dear Mike, hope everything is fine with you, especially today on your birthday. Bet you thought I'd forget, haha. Thought you might appreciate this. Take care, your friend, Rod.
