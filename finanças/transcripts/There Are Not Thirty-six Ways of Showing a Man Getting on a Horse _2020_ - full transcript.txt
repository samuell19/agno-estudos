There are not thirty-six ways of showing a man getting on a horse. Chapter 1 Chapter 2 It’s Friday, and the professor is arriving late to his second class. Today’s lesson is Classical Film Grammar. As it’s been a while since he last taught this topic, he goes over some ideas to begin the class with on the subway. One. Narrative Clarity. Two. Invisible Editing. Three. Formal Balance. Four. The shot adjusts to the contents of the narration. As being in a hurry and the rush hour prevent him from finishing his reading, he decides to rely on procedural memory. The class goes on without difficulties until, towards the end, he finds, next to some of his notes on “The Birth of a Nation”... by David Griffith, an asterisk he hadn’t noticed before: “Mention that the actor who plays Lincoln’s murderer... is a great American film director called Raoul Walsh.” This information doesn’t seem to impress anyone, so the professor goes through his notebook again... and finds the following note: “Go back to the initial question on classical cinema. Quote Walsh.” But the quote is not written down. Standing before a completely silent class, the professor... finds himself obligated to go off topic, until suddenly, perhaps due to the pressure of time on the brain, he believes the quote said something like: “There are not thirty-six ways of showing a man getting on a horse”. Once home, something starts worrying him. He knows the quote was sufficient for the course learning objectives, but still mistrusts his untimely memory. Conscious of his obsessive nature, he decides to find the quote exactly as Walsh stated it, so as to write it down on his notebook and simply quote it properly. He resolves to begin the search with his most immediate memory: he had read that quote in Cinematógrafos, a book... written by Edgardo Cozarinsky published by BAFICI in 2010. Indeed, in the last essay titled... “Continuity of Griffith. Notes on a living tradition”, he finds, next to an exclamation mark, the quote: “Walsh once stated there are not thirty-six ways of showing a man... going into a room. (Words sometimes quoted in other versions: to show a man getting on a horse).” For some reason, his mind had focused on the parentheses, (the horses), and discarded the rooms which, at this moment, seemed very strange to him… Still feeling confused, he notices Cozarinsky doesn’t mention the source of the phrase. Perhaps in its original source it was just like he remembered it. The professor sits down. “Continuity of Griffith” is dated 1965. Therefore, Cozarinsky must have read this phrase... in some text about Walsh, prior to that year. On impulse and mechanically, he goes towards his computer and asks an acquaintance... if it’s possible to get Cozarinsky’s email address. At the same time, he writes another email explaining his concern... to a group of historian friends, colleagues and cinephiles. While he waits for an answer, he does what it’s accustomed to: he googles it. “There are not thirty-six ways of showing a man getting on a horse... + Raoul Walsh”. The search engine suggests to remove the inverted commas, but still, nothing turns up. He receives the first answer sooner that he’d expected. There it is, Edgardo Cozarinsky’s email address. He writes him neatly and sends the email. When he returns to the inbox, he sees another email. It’s from Lucía Salas,a friend who is a film critic living in Los Angeles. She attaches issue number 154 of Cahiers du Cinéma. It’s a rustic PDF file, a black and white scan... that has turned its famous yellow cover into a plain white. Still, in the cover dated April 1964, a picture of Gunnel Lindblom in Bergman’s “The Silence” stands out. “Maybe you can find something here”, writes Lucía. Although the font is blurred, he starts reading. Page one. “Interview with Raoul Walsh by Jean-Louis Noames”. The professor goes attentively through the interview, Lucía said he could find something there. The interview took place during the shooting of Walsh’s last film, “A Distant Trumpet”, and the dossier is mainly dedicated to him. Suddenly, on a page with a still from “Marines Let’s Go!”, the French film critic asks: - In an American magazine, you stated... that there was only one way of showing a man entering a room… - Yes, that’s one of my principles. Young directors try too hard. To film a man entering a room, they put the camera under the table… They do it in many different ways. But, really, there is only one way of filming it: making that man walk into the room. So... One: The thirty-six ways turn into one. Two: The horses are still missing. Lucía adds a piece of information to this revelation: Jean-Lous Noames was, actually, film critic Louis Skorecki's pseudonym. In the early 60s, when he was only 17 years old, Skorecki had traveled to the US with his friend, the critic Serge Daney, in order to interview a series of American film directors, Raoul Walsh among them. By that time, they were both working for Cahiers... and, at the same time, they start the magazine... Visages du cinema, of only two issues. The professor reads those lines one more time: - In an American magazine, you stated… This means there is an American magazine in which Skorecki... read this statement, and that must be prior to 1964. The professor remembers Skorecki not only is alive, but also writes for the French Magazine So Film, in which Fernando Ganzo, a friend of his, is editor in chief. Ganzo lives in France. The professor figures it must be 2 o’clock in the morning over there. Nevertheless, he writes him an email, and ten minutes later he receives... a five-minute voice message on WhatsApp. Ganzo promises to write Skorecki, although a reply seems unlikely. However, he attaches a screenshot of The Classical Hollywood Cinema... writen by Jane Staiger, Kristin Thompson and David Bordwell, in which Walsh’s sentence appears like this: “There is only one way of filming a scene”, Raoul Walsh stated, “and it’s the way that shows the audience what will happen next.” Close enough. The quote is from “Why Hollywood”, a text by Thomas Elsaesser written... in 1971 for the first issue of the extinct Monogram magazine. Actually, that same phrase is repeated in thousands of academic studies: Douglas Tallack, Frederik Gustafsson, Diane Crane... and even the writer Katherine Pancol. But none of them refers to any other source than Bordwell’s. A dead-end road. The professor writes on a blank corner of his old teaching notebook: Email Skorecki: Fernando. It’s been too much for today. Day's residues suggest he should dream about horses, but he prefers not to look into its hypothetical meaning. It’s a shame: as they say, to dream about horses is related to upcoming success, prosperity and happiness. Even more so, if you dream you are riding the horse. The next day, the professor still has no news from Cozarinsky... and he doesn’t remember what he dreamt about. However, he sees Ganzo texted him again at 3 A.M. in the morning. He mentions Jacques Lourcelles, another living film critic of that time who directed Présence du Cinéma, one of the three mythical French magazines that lasted only a few years. Issue number 13 was, actually, dedicated to Raoul Walsh. The professor writes on his notebook: Look for Présence du Cinéma, issue 13. Perhaps because of those involuntary associations, as he has breakfast, he recalls reading Walsh’s statement in a small book... on classical cinema by the film critic and teacher Eduardo Russo. He grabs the book, goes through it, and nothing. Still, he takes courage and sends him an email... telling him about the situation and summarizing what he found so far. Eduardo Russo replies really kindly, and surprisingly fast: “I remember the equine version of the statement. What has slipped my mind, (which doesn’t mean I ever... stopped using it), is where I wrote it. I went through some of my old articles about Walsh, but I didn’t find anything.” “Based on what you tell me about the way Skorecki asks the question... in the interview on Cahiers du cinéma, I think the most viable reference... is an interview on the Mekas brothers’ magazine, Film Culture, a few years before that. I’m looking for the exact issue. When I read your email last night, I began digging and noticed... the reference to that interview, although now I can’t find it. I have a few issues of Film Culture of that time at home... and some anthologies, too. I’ll look into that. Later that day, another film critic friend called Lucas Granero, answers to the cry for help... and sends him a rough PDF of issue 13 of Présence du Cinéma... with a great discovery: lost among other quotes by Walsh, he finds the one he is looking for, but with a new variation: “There is only one way of showing a man entering a room." "You mustn’t film it in five different ways.” Now there are not thirty-six, nor one; there are five ways. But the true novelty of this text it's not the variation of the quote, but the hint of a possible origin of Walsh’s statement. The quote refers, precisely, to an American magazine. The reference says: “In Variety, February 28th, 1961” Everything seems to indicate this is the American Magazine... Skorecki refers to in his interview. It makes sense: Variety’s article was published in 1961... and, in 1964, Skorecki takes it to quote his statement, although paraphrased, to Walsh himself. So, all he had to do now was to find that issue of Variety in which... that article was published. Who knows… Perhaps that’s where Cozarinsky read the mention of the horses. Although the professor regularly checks his inbox, including the spam, he still hasn’t got any news from Cozarinsky. But Lucía does send him an email. She has begun in L.A. the search... for the issue of Variety published in February 28th, 1961. But there is a problem: the digitize issues of the magazine her University Library has, go just up to February 22nd. Lucía commits herself to look for it somewhere else, even if she has to borrow from another University Library. Just in case, the professor contacts David Oubiña, another friend teacher of Film History, who has also access to university archives all over the world. Oubiña looks for February’s issue 28 with no luck, but his effort is not for nothing, as he discovers something else: the interview on Variety took place on February 28th, 1961, but the magazine was published the following day, on March 1st. That is, there was an error in the reference quoted in Présence du Cinéma... and they had mistaken the date of the interview... with the date of its publishing. This discovery comes along with, finally, Variety’s issue... dated March 1st, 1961 that Oubiña attaches. The magazine looks like a newspaper, filled with notes and almost without blank margins. On page 2, between a column about Elvis’ comeback at a benefit concert... and another one about Paul Anka in Coconut Grove, he finally finds a small column dedicated to Walsh, titled: “Easier to handle actors who never went to drama school”. The unsigned interview also took place during a shooting. Apparently, film directors at that time... were interviewed only when they were filming. On this occasion, Walsh is, oddly enough, in Kyoto, during the shooting of “Marines, Let’s Go!”. The professor stops reading there, and remembers the picture on... page 33 of Cahiers du Cinéma in which Skorecki quoted the phrase, belonged to that same film. After a long pause, he evaluates the possibility of relating numbers: issue 154 with page 33, Skorecki being 17 years old and... Walsh being 74 years old during the shooting of “Marines, Let’s Go!”. But he decides to resume his reading... and to look for a clearer sign that doesn’t involve numerology. “There is only one way of showing a man entering a room. You can’t film it five different ways.” Apparently, Cozarinsky read Cahiers, who quoted Variety, but there is no mention of the horses along that way. There is a reference to Walsh’s skills with horses, or to the importance of actors and horses in his movies, but what prevails in his words is not this, but the almost... logical and natural way of filming a person entering a room. He stops the search for a while. He realizes there is nothing more to look for, nor to find. He begins to accept a small triumph, so as to avoid thinking of a great failure. A little trick that allows him to address other matters... perhaps more urgent: To prepare his third class, which will be in no time. The lesson is “Comedy”, mainly through Buster Keaton's and Charles Chaplin's figures. As he intends to update the teaching materials he shows in class, he discovers several movies by Chaplin and Keaton, along with other thousands of films and books, will be in the public domain from January 1st on. Among them, there is “Lost and Found on a South Sea Island”, one of Raoul Walsh’s first feature-films, of which some sources claim there is only one reel left. Apparently, aside from sharing this occasional list, Walsh and Chaplin shared many leisure moments. For example, Douglas Fairbanks, the main character of “The Thief of Bagdad”, used to invite them to play a game he invented: "Dougledyas", or simply, "Doug". A game that kept some rules similar to tennis, but allowed up to six players. A feather similar to badminton’s ones worked as a ball, and... besides from a racket, one could use any part of the body. In effect, there they are, among others: Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin and Raoul Walsh after playing "Doug". Trapped in a net that linked everything to Walsh’s figure, the professor checks his inbox again. He receives a message from Lucía, who also seemed to be... playing this invented game no one could get out of. Apparently, as she was writing an article for a magazine, she came across an interview Pascale Bodet and Emmanuel Levaufre... made to the critic and filmmaker Paul Vecchialli between 2001 and 2002. The interview, scanned by Lucía, has a suggestive title: “The Movement of the Obvious”. Not only is Walsh mentioned in the interview, but also something that seemed forgotten, reappears: "Are you familiar with the famous phrases by Walsh? Like... There are not thirty-six ways of filming somebody…” And he interrupts: “…but placing the camera in front of him”. The movement of the obvious. The thirty-six ways reappear, but multiplied by a thousand. And as if all of them had faced the same problem, he receives another email from Eduardo Russo, in which he hypothesizes: I believe the original quote probably doesn’t refer to the number thirty-six, which the French use as synonym for “many”, but to something like “there are not so many ways of showing... a man getting on a horse, or walking into a room”. Now that I think about it, this could explain our 36 Billiards… I’ve always wondered about this number, considering there are not thirty-six tables there. This could explain it. By the way... I’d rather stay with the version about the man getting on a horse. That night, the professor gets in touch with a French friend of his, Juan Antonio Herrera, who confirms this hypothesis: “There are not thirty-six ways of…” is a French expression. Thirty-six is a number frequently used to describe an uncertain and... significant amount, in a context in which it is coherent... to consider thirty-six as significant. There is the expression “to see thirty-six candles”, which means “to see stars after being hit”, or “to do thirty-six things at the same time”. Some expressions even use it in contrast, in negative sentences: “this has not thirty-six solutions”, to say there is only one, or “there are not thirty-six ways of doing… anything”, meaning there is only one. So, if the expression is French, the hypothesis of Cozarinsky not having read the phrase in Variety... but in Cahiers, stays strong. However, the phrase doesn’t appear like this in Cahiers. Perhaps he became familiar with the expression in the 60’s... when he was living in France, and therefore translated the phrase in Variety like this. Among several false trails, the professor manages to get in touch with... the film critic Carlos Losilla, from whom he had read a text about Walsh. Maybe he came across the phrase before. Losilla replies: “Yes, I heard and read that legend during my cinematographic development, and I feel the same way: I don’t know to what extent this is true or invented. The only thing I can say, is that I have another source. In issue number 38 of the magazine Dirigido Por…, dated November, 1976, José María Latorre dedicated the first of two consecutive articles... to Raoul Walsh... (“Raoul Walsh, the great forgotten one”) and wrote the apocryphal quote about the doors. He doesn’t mention a source, or anything else.” Lucas sends him a digital copy of this magazine in perfect condition. Just as Losilla said, in the text by José María Latorre appears, among other characteristic phrases by Walsh, the version of the room. Actually, it is literally the statement from Cahiers, but inverted: “To film a person entering a room, young directors exaggerate, they put the camera under the table, they try many ways of doing it. But actually, there is only one way of filming that: making that man walk into the room.” The professor now thinks: Cozarinsky’s text is about Griffith and, towards the end, he quotes Walsh. What if Cozarinsky wrote about Walsh? Under a self-induced hypnosis, the professor searches on the internet again: “Edgardo Cozarinsky + Raoul Walsh”. The first result is, literally, a quote from Cinematógrafos. The second one is a picture of Edgardo Cozarinsky in 1989, taken by Cristina Fraire and on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, next to a picture of another Walsh: María Elena, in 1952, by Grete Stern. But the third result shows a new book, published in 1980: Cinema: A Critical Dictionary, in which Richard Roud compiles... texts by theorists and film critics about every director in Film History. Cozarinsky, in effect, writes about Walsh. To the professor’s surprise, towards the end of this short text, the author quotes a different version of the phrase: “There are not five different ways of showing a man entering a room”. That is, an exact translation of the phrase in Variety, which strengthens the hypothesis that he changed into a traditional... French expression throughout successive rewritings. But where did Cozarinsky get the horses he mentions in his own text from? With a movement that Sisyphus himself would envy, the professor goes back to Cinematógrafos. He starts to believe the answer is in reading again. In the introduction, Cozarinsky mentions the article had been published... originally in 1965 in the magazine Tiempo de Cine, and afterwards in... a catalogue published by the Portuguese Cinematheque in 2004. Immediately, he sends two emails. The first one to Maria João, a Portuguese friend... who organizes Portuguese Cinema Days in Buenos Aires, and the second one to Sergio Wolf, a teacher coworker... who was the Artistic Director of BAFICI and editor of Cinematógrafos. The first to answer is Wolf, who finds among his papers the double issue of Tiempo de Cine, numbers 18 and 19, published in March, 1965. In order to get some fresh air, the professor decides to go over his house... and see the magazine in person. When he returns, he receives an email form Maria João, who tells him she’ll get in touch with Antonio Rodrigues, editor and compiler of that catalogue, and that she’ll write him back soon. Meanwhile, the professor flicks through Tiempo de Cine. Published a year after issue 154 of Cahiers du Cinéma, he can see, on the green cover, the picture of Diego Puente as Polín... in Leonardo Favio’s "Chronicle of a Boy Alone". There, an “extraordinary double issue” is announced: “Red Desert”, Argentine Cinema and its men, Festivals in the world, Interviews to Torre Nilsson, Lindsay Anderson, Jacques Demy and Mario Camus, New American Cinema, Film History in 120 films, Latin American Cinema, and… “Continuity of Griffith”, the original text by Edgardo Cozarinsky. The article, in general, is very similar to the fragments... in the commented version in Cinematógrafos, in 2010. But, towards the end, Walsh’s statement simply says: “There are not thirty-six ways of showing a man entering a room”. Period. When did Cozarinsky include the horses? Evidently, between 1965 and 2010 versions, he read about the horses somewhere... and considered it significant enough to include it, at least inside parentheses, in the updated version. But, where? He gets an email from Antonio Rodrigues, who attaches a scan of the catalogue by the Portuguese Cinematheque. But, once again, the phrase includes the rooms. At least this paragraph is identical to the version in Tiempo de Cine: Thirty-six ways, and no horses. This investigation seemed to end just like the professor ended his class: with Griffith and Walsh. He opens the three versions of the text. 1965, 2004, 2010. He pays attention to what comes after the phrase, to the conclusion. He identifies small but yet striking differences there. In the three versions, after quoting Walsh, the text continues: “His words reveal the classical artist’s attitude towards language: Facts prevail over the way of filming them.” But in 2010, after the phrase, he says: “The critic and the contemporary filmmaker know, however, that there are infinite ways of showing the same action, but that the value of the one the artist choses (or finds)... lies in his ability to persuade that this is the only possible way.” On the other hand, in the version of 1965 and 2004, he says: “The critic, however, knows there are…” It’s logical. In 1965, Cozarinsky was working as a critic and was, through this statement, showing the strong bond between a critic and his or her object of study. He was talking about his own relationship with cinema. He’ll only show himself as a filmmaker five years later, when he releases his first feature film: "...". In 2010, without explicitly stating it, he already seemed to consider his work as a critic had come to an end. He includes the word “filmmaker” because he already was one. Therefore, this quote touched him personally as a film critic... but also as the filmmaker he now was. The professor starts thinking about this and remembers the story... by another Walsh: Rodolfo. In it, a completely insane translator begins to get distracted. He skips words and sentences, and even invents a completely new document from head to toe. At that moment, the translator begins to realize, to fantasize, that he could be a writer himself. The professor thinks that perhaps, just as that insane translator or... as Cozarinsky thought, he could become a filmmaker. At that moment, he receives a message from Fernando Ganzo. It simply says: “Skorecki replied”. He knows the answer will be there, in the person who met face to face with Raoul Walsh in 1965. The one who read the original quote “in an American magazine”. He knows he’ll reveal what magazine was that, what Walsh said, and that he’ll confirm Cozarinsky’s invention, beyond his now unlikely reply. He opens the screenshot Ganzo attached: “I’m sorry, it’s been a long time… Good luck... (by the way, Hawks or Ford also formulated statements like that).” He doesn’t remember, of course. It’s been 56 years. But he does remember something and writes it, towards the end, inside parentheses, as if he was sharing a secret: “The idea is that cinema is simple”. Skorecki, without knowing about the professor’s investigation, the people he consulted with, the texts he read or the screenshots he saw… still knew the problem, or it’s solution, wasn’t there but, precisely, in cinema itself. The professor makes a pause... and starts downloading every movie directed by Raoul Walsh he finds. Between short and feature films, Walsh has more than 140 films. Most of his silent movies are lost. Another one, hard to find. Fortunately, he finds several films. He leaves them downloading and, finally, goes to sleep. Chapter 3 The professor goes back to the classroom for his third class. He opens his notebook where it says: He looks away before he begins, and picks up the thread of the previous class. That’s when it occurs to him to mention the details of his investigation... and cites the phrase by Walsh, just as he remembered it: “There are not thirty-six ways of showing a man getting on a horse.” There is a general silence again. The professor looks at his notebook, and begins the class.
