Hey. Who's that? You can trust him. The uh, the place is under construction, so don't worry about any alarms. If I hear anything go out on the radio, I'll head it off. I got a bad feeling about this, man. Didn't Frank pass in this job? I need the money, Kevin. We're in. Let's go. Jackpot! That's what we came for. What the fuck is that? It's a motion sensor. 43-17. 43-18. Possible Code 5 burglary in progress at the Cash House. Any units in the vicinity? What do we do now? If a call went out, I'm sure Zwick got it. I can't get caught, man. April... I'm all she got. What-- what do we do? Kev-- Kev, it's gonna be okay. Your sister's gonna be fine. But let's get a move on. Pack up that stuff and take it to the van. I got this. Dispatch, this is DC 11, I'm in the area. I'll swing by. 4317, copy? I'm almost 97th. Three minutes out. Shit! Zwick, what you got? This one's dead. What the fuck, man? You shot him! Put your hands up on your head! You piece of shit! Do it now! Come on, turn around. Let's go. Now, listen to me very carefully, Miller. Your friend had a gun. He shot twice at me. And I defended myself. Do I have that right? Fuck you! Think of Beth and the baby. Okay. Let's go. Open two! Welcome to the world. We gonna get you back on your feet. I need a locksmith. Figured I could get you set up. Except I'm a felon. They took my cert. You know that. Oh, we'll put you down as handyman on the books for your PO. Just until you get sorted. Whatever it takes. I just want to make things right with Beth and Lindsay. Did you ever tell them what really went down that night? Say hello to your new accommodations. There's a shower next to the shitter in the back. Man, you have no idea how happy I am to hear that. I think you two have met before. You kidding me? Yeah. What? I thought this thing would be a bunch of spare parts by now. Man, I kept it running for you. Kept it just the way you like it, dents and all. Even added a few new ones. Thank you, Frank. Something else. This is my old phone. I got you a cheap plan. You pay the first every month. And uh, here's an advance. Lock up after you leave. Hey Frank, what's up with April? As far as I know, she stayed in that foster care situation. I took my stab at being mentor material to you and Kevin. You see how that worked out. Uh, after the trial, I reached out to her. She didn't seem interested in staying in touch. Alright. Don't burn down the place. I won't. This is Fisher. Hi Beth. Miller? I just got out. Can we meet? Can I see Lindsay? Hi. Hi Lindsay. You're sticking to me. Say hello. Hi. Let's sit down. Yeah, thanks. Oh my gosh! Lindsay, you're so big. What are you in like, fifth grade now? Sixth. Ah, sixth. Hey Linds, why don't you go over to Rosie, and grab us a few slices of pie. Yeah? Any flavor you want. I'll pick. You pick, you choose. Okay. You look great, Beth. Miller. What? What is this? What do you mean? This is lunch. Right. Two slices of lemon meringue. And what does your dad like? I'm not sure. And what are we doing meeting here of all places? Oh, we used to come here all the time. So, I just had good memories here. Right. Something about those nights sitting up at that counter. Waiting for you to finish your shift. And I remember coming back and having to work doubles after you went inside. I'm sorry. Miller, I'm here for Lindsay. You know... I came to see if I can let our daughter have a relationship with you. I'm her father. Not for the last 10 years. This is no excuse but 10 years ago, I was afraid I couldn't provide for you guys. And so I fucked up. I made a really, really bad decision. A really bad decision. Jesus. Kevin died. Look. I want you to spend time with her, okay? I really do. So, I... I need to know that you're not gonna abandon her again. She can't handle that. What do I have to do to prove it to you? Stick around. A lunch date isn't enough. You got to be patient. It's been 10 years. I get it. You've been in there. Nothing to do but think about who you have on the outside. And then you get on the outside and you realize that everybody else has been moving on. Except for you. Except me? What do you mean except me? You see this empire I've built? No, I just mean that you didn't turn your back on me. No, I'd never turn my back on you. Beth moved on and you fucked up bad. Thanks, Frank. I mean real bad. Yeah, I get it. She bounced back all by herself. She doesn't need you. But if you're patient, if you keep your nose clean, if you're good to Lindsay, and if you take care of yourself, someday she might remember what you two used to have and want just a little bit of that back. Man, when'd you get so deep? I'm just a man who made a lot of mistakes in life. Rise and shine, Good Behavior. You got a job. Okay. Okay. You're the locksmith? You called us, didn't you? That's cute. These digital locks, they're the best, right? Definitely. And I can change the code whenever I want? I guess. You think you could do a few more units? Yeah, I got more stock in here. Great. Let's get it going. So, all these rentals are yours? Yeah. With tenants coming and going, it'll be nice just to be able to reset some codes. Looks like business is good. You know, you came highly recommended. Well, there's not a lock that Frank can't fix. No, not Frank. Miller, right? Miller Graham. Yeah. Someone referred you. I doubt it, man. I just started. No. April Reyes, this girl that works for me, she said you were good and I thought, "good locksmith?" What the fuck does that mean? April works for you? Mm-hmm. And she lives right over here. I give her a break on the rent. She a friend of yours? Yeah. I used to know her. Well, you must have left quite an impression. I'm looking for a locksmith. Think you can help me out? No, sorry I'm just a handyman. But I'll see if Frank's in. What about that job I just got you? April? You didn't recognize me. I just uh... Damn. You're... What... an adult? All grown up, yeah. Thanks for getting me that job. Kevin would have wanted to see you get back on your feet. So, what are you up to now that you're out? You're looking at it. No more safe cracking? No. That's a mistake I won't make again. That's too bad. I heard you were pretty good at it. Yeah, people talk. Oh, come on. You were good. You were really good. I was okay. Okay? Alright. I was pretty fucking great. Well, for jobs like that, it must be really hard to find a good partner, right? Someone you can trust entirely. I wish I never brought him there that night. I'm not talking about Kevin. I need money, Miller. Bad. Are you in some kind of trouble or something? I'll tell you if you say you'll help me get out of it. You know I'd do anything for you. Hey! Hey, wait a sec. No, people always say they'll do anything for you right before they tell you why they won't do anything. April, the shit I was doing, it's the kind of stuff people do, when they're trying to cut corners. And I promise it catches up with you. I did time for it. Yeah, you did time for it. And Kevin? What exactly are you asking me? Oh, I'm not asking you anything. You're not gonna help me, so I'm not asking. Did that do it for Beth? "I did my time". Okay. Just wait a second. Hold on. Let's talk. Sounded good out there. I think April just asked me to help her with a robbery. That's not someone your PO would want you to associate with. Still, I got to find some way to help her. Not like that. Keep your eyes on the prize. You're right. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Hi officers. Is there a problem? Early release, huh? For good behavior. Come out. Let's go! Step out of the vehicle. What do you want, Zwick? You know, I... I don't know what sorts of thoughts go through a man's head when he's locked in a box for 10 years. But I just thought I'd pay you a visit. You know, bring you up to speed on a few things. I'm retiring. I'm gonna spend my afternoons playing golf and getting buzzed on Bud Lights. And I have you to thank partly for that. Busting you and your friend was one of the things that got bumped to Lieutenant. But you know, these gentlemen are not retiring. Miller, please meet Detectives Perez and Jones. Detectives Perez and Jones, meet Miller. Man, you told me to never breathe a word. And I didn't. And I commend you for that. I do. I do. I just... Just hey, come on. Hey, hey... I need you to know something. That if you ever try and fuck with me in any way, these gentlemen can and will make your life miserable. What are you doing? We got something. Well, well, well Miller. He's a convicted felon, Chief. He had his locksmithing certification revoked. Yeah, but did you actually see him use the kit though? I mean, no sir, but you got to understand, is this guy here-- Then what the hell is he doing in my station in cuffs? Are you out of your mind? It was Zwick. Oh, come on. Zwick wasn't anyone near this. I was making a run for Frank. It's a locksmith van. There's equipment in the back. Then, don't drive around in a locksmith van. They would have pulled me over if I was on roller blades. It didn't matter what I was driving. Everything matters at this point, Miller. You're on parole. Another mistake and you're done. Look, next time, detectives, just use a little due diligence before you haul someone in here. Detective Fisher. Chief. Mr. Graham. You can't locksmith without a certificate. I know that, sir. I'm just a handyman. Yeah, you mentioned that. But I don't know if I believe it. But as there's no evidence of any illegal activity on your part, you're free to go. But if I ever see you in this station again, I will call your parole officer, you understand that? I understand. You're free to go. Uncuff him. Okay. Let's start with having you come by two times a week. Twice a week? Late to your first meeting, Mr. Graham. Not a good look. That's not gonna happen again. Good. I'll see you next Monday on time. Oh, and grab the cup on that window outside with your name on it. Bathroom's to the left. When you're done, put your sample on the tray with the others. Yes, ma'am. Frank, you here? Yeah. You missed a job. Guy said you stood him up. Yeah, I'm sorry. Some shit came up today that was beyond my control. Look, I know you just got out. But you can't be missing jobs. They got something called "Yelp" nowadays. Hey uh, you think you could take me on as an actual handyman? Actual handyman. Huh. Okay. No bump in pay. There are some benefits. Yeah? You get your own special mop and bucket. Okay, Indie, paw, paw. Linds, come on! We're gonna be late. I'm almost ready. Shake, good. Yes, good job. Ready? This isn't ready. Is that what you're wearing to the party tonight? I'm not going to the party tonight. Allison can't come over, so I thought you and I could make some popcorn and watch a movie. Why, what's wrong with this? Nothing. It looks fine. Why don't you just ask dad? I think your father needs just a little more time getting settled in. If he's not busy, I'm sure he can handle it. And you can go to the party and have fun for once. Fun? Remind me what that is? I'll think about it. Come on, let's go. Guys, yeah, alright. Alright, alright. Lieutenant Zwick's work with this force has been a deep service to our community and I would like to personally congratulate him on an incredible career. Yeah. Speech! Um, I'm just... I'm happy to have left the streets of Dos Caminos a little safer. And uh, serving with some of the Borderland's finest has been the honor of my lifetime. And so uh, thank you. Um, and... One more thing. Miller Graham, the man I put away the night I was under fire in the line of duty has recently been released from prison. So uh, watch your six out there, fellas. Oh, and of course, attendance at my party later on is mandatory, alright. Fisher, my office. Beth, with my retirement we are down a man on Vice. I'd like you to fill that slot. Wow. Really, um.... Here you go, boys. I'm just a little um... Surprised? Yes. Yeah. I'm not as stupid as I look. And I'm sure it hasn't always been easy having me as a supervisor given what happened between me and that asshole ex of yours. Just consider this my way of saying, I always thought you were good police, Fisher. Oh well, I-- I can't just drop my other cases. Yeah, by the way, I wouldn't worry too much about that. Those will all get transitioned. This is-- this is the real police work here, you know. Beth, these men can't drink their whisky until you accept. Then I accept. Whoo! There it is. Ah, there it is. Alright. Out of here, all of you. Thank you. We'll see you out there, Fisher. Yes, yes. Oh, Lieutenant, um... What is it exactly that you'd like me to jump into? Oh. Yeah, just you know, just really dig into the case files. Get a sense of what we're working on here. Sir. Alright. Hello? Hey. Um, there's this thing tonight at the King of Spades. The cop bar? Yeah. I was wondering if you could pick Lindsay up from her piano lesson and spend a little bit of time with her. I usually ask the neighbor, but she's not around. No, I would love that. Great. Okay, so, you got to go over her homework, make sure she's done it. Hold on. Okay. Homework. And no fast food, real dinner. No fast food. Okay, what else? That's it. Oh. I can drop her off at your house after... Uh no, no, no. The bar is fine. Uh, I gotta go. Okay. Beth, um... Yeah? Thank you. You bet. See you next week, okay. Bye, Miss Dandus. Thank you. Hi, dad. Hey. That sounded so good. Thanks. Got all your stuff? Yeah. Alright, let's bounce. Okay. Do you anything you're really good at? Hm. Not really. What about picking locks? Mom told me you're the best. She did, did she? Mhmmm. Will you show me? I see that smile. Alright. Give me a couple of your bobby pins. Okay. Most people think picking locks is like mysterious. But locks are actually kind of easy to crack. You don't even need a kit like I use. Alright, so this is your tension lever. And this is your pick. So, we're going to take the tension lever and stick it in the bottom of the lock. Okay, now there's five pins in this lock. We're gonna take the pick and put it in the lock just above the tension lever. And we're going to feel for the pins. Now, one of the pins is gonna be harder to push up than the others. It's called the "seized pin". And that's the one we're looking for. So... Okay there. There, there, there, that guy. Right now push him up while you turn the tension lever and guess what? Hey. Hey. Oh, looks like someone had fun. Yeah. We had a good time. We did. Homework is done and we had a nice dinner. Great. And you are my excuse for a quick exit, so... Let's get you home, missy. Okay. That's a lot of people. What's the occasion? Hey, baby? Yeah? Why don't you wait in the car? Sure. Okay. Um... Zwick's retirement. Mm. Miller, come on. I had to go. Yeah, it's your job. Well, with Zwick out, there's an opening on Vice, so. And you're taking it? Yeah. Anyway, thank you for tonight. Yeah. Night. Night. Miller! Did uh, Beth tell you the good news? That you no longer have a badge? Yeah, I'm going home to celebrate. That's-- That's actually pretty funny. You know uh, Vice is a dangerous unit. I mean things happen out there, okay. And all you got are your fellow detectives to watch your back. It's a good thing she's got Perez and Jones. April, what the hell are you doing here? I'm in trouble, Miller. The man I work for... Real estate guy? That's a front. A front for what? He runs girls. So, you're like a... A call girl. Don't you dare fucking judge me. I didn't choose this. After Kevin died, I didn't have anyone. There was no one there to stop it. He won't let me go. Last year, I tried to run and he beat me so bad I was in the hospital for three weeks. And he's still hurting me. We have to go to the police now. No, they're in on it. Beth's not. I'm telling you it is not gonna work. I need to get out of town. I need to go somewhere they will never find me. And I need money to do it. You know I can't. So, you're just gonna let them keep hurting me? I swore to myself when I walked through those gates that I'd stay clean and I'd spend the rest of my life making it up to you, Beth, and Lindsay. Yeah. Just not necessarily in that order. Hey, that's... Look, you don't give a shit about me. You say you want to make it up to me, but just tell me the fucking truth. You just care about getting your real family back. You're family, too. No. Kevin was my real family. He was the only family I ever had. And none of this would have happened if he was still alive. What's the job? A poker game. Easy money. You hit it. I take the cash. And I run. Then you'll have made it up to me. It'll just be a few questions, ma'am. Hm. I know this one. Used to run around with my friend's younger sister. Yeah? Small town. Zero record of prostitution arrests in the last three years. Like I said, Fisher, small town. What, people don't pay for sex in small towns. Yo, I thought you said this was a poker game. It is. Looks like a whole fucking party to me. That's a lot of eyes. It's nothing you can't handle. Garrett does this every month. He dresses up the game like it's some classy casino night. Charges a high buy-in, the buy-in goes into the pot. And then he takes a big cut for hosting, on top of what he makes from the girls working the players all night. And who are the players? Execs. Business types that drive into town just for the game. They're definitely not trouble. So, you take the money, and I'll meet you back at Frank's when I'm done for the night. What's the take? Half a million dollars. What? That's a fucking shit ton of money. Yeah. Enough for me to start a new life. So, what about security? You're looking at it. Why am I not surprised? Three years ago, all these women were picked up on prostitution charges. Then arrests dry up. Okay. So, we booked them, they stopped turning their tricks. Sounds like a win to me. No, no. Come here, look at the files. Each woman gives the same street as their address. The same development. All owned by Garrett Field. Okay, so I'm not following. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe they all just found different forms of occupation. Or, maybe whoever they're working for just got a little bit better at hiding it. Go high, boys. Piece. Where are we going? We should have some privacy. Like that. Yeah. Shit! Fuck. I'm so sorry. Let me see that. Um, let me help you. I'll help you carry it. It was an accident. Do you know how embarrassing-- Get over here and sit. Ow! You're hurting me. Thank you. Come on! Let go! Hey. You better know how to use that thing. You're gonna need it to get out of here. What are you doing? You-- you got the money! Don't be stupid. There are 30 people out there. You pull that trigger, you'll be dead before you reach the door. Who are you? Hey, stop right there! Freeze! Hey, stay calm, man. You! Back off or I'll blow her fucking brains out. Let me go! You don't wanna do this, man. I said back off! Be the smart guy. We can all walk away from this. Come on. Hey, hey, hey! Fuck! Enjoying your cocktail? Useless! And where the hell were you? He overpowered me. Really? You got something to say about that? Just save it. Just find out who he is and get my money back. Fucking... Hey, it's April. Leave me a message. Hey, it's April. Shit! April? April? Please tell me your father didn't teach you that? I saw it on YouTube. Yeah, right! Hand 'em over before I throw you in the slammer! Oh no, not the slammer. Eat your breakfast. Okay. Tanya? Beth. Long time. Yeah. Uh, Linds, why didn't you finish getting ready for school? Uh, take Indie. Come on, Indie. Thank you. Come on in. There you go. Thanks. Um, so April and I, we work together, you know like um... entertaining. At first, I really liked it. You know, I had nice things. A home, car. So, when Garrett asked me to April about it, I just did. You mean, Garrett Field, the real estate developer? Yeah. And I mean I wouldn't have asked April about it, if I knew that it was gonna turn into what it did. You know, the car and the clothes; none of its ours. He even puts us up in these nice places, but he owns them all, you know. If any of us ever try to get out, it would be bad. Here, I want to show you something. I don't know what'll happen if he finds out I took these. April's been having a lot of issues with Garrett. The other day she shows me these bruises on her arm. And then last night I hear what sounds like a break-in at her apartment. And now, she's just... gone. This morning I see Miller going into her place. Miller? Are you sure? It was him. Shit. This is a job April asked you to pull. Are you insane? I can explain... No, that's a serious question I'm asking and I need an answer. Are you out of your mind? They took her. She's missing. Oh. Oh, I'm-- I'm trying to understand, why you would get yourself involved in something like this? Do you want to go back to prison? They're hurting her, Frank. She showed me the bruises. Okay, this girls needs to get out of town and this was the only way she could think of to get the money. The part I'm missing is, you explaining how that's your responsibility. 'Cause I owe her. What am I supposed to do just let her get killed? Look, I know you have a tough choice to make. But you made the wrong one. You gotta go to Beth. She's the one you owe. Take this cash back. Tell her to go find April. And let her do her job. It's not that simple. Zwick's involved. Well, that's even more of a reason why you need to tell her to watch your back. It's too dangerous. Trust me, she's safer not knowing. I gotta handle this on my own. You better hope that you find her before they find you. Just gonna go back to Garrett's. She's there, I know it. Can I please just keep this in the safe for one night? I want it out by morning. Okay. After this I'm done, I promise. What the hell happened here? I caught this one with half her take stuffed in the bottom of her purse. So, you beat her half to death? You want me to protect your money or not? Just not the face, Zwick. Why do you keep doing this? She's worthless to me for what, a month? That is coming out of your end. Bullshit it's coming out of my end-- I don't have time for this. Just take the girls back to the development. Perez and Jones will make sure they get back alright. You and I, we're having a talk. Garrett is nasty. But uh, when he wants something done, it's usually one of those three. So, I couldn't go to anyone else. Beth, can you help her? I'm gonna try. Hey Miller? Yo. You got a sec? Yeah, of course. Can I get you something? Beer, or water? Uh, I'm on duty. Thanks though. Hey, have you seen April at all since you were released? No. No? Why is something wrong? Well, Tanya, you remember Tanya, right? Yeah. Yeah. She lives across the street from April. Thinks she saw something the other night. So, I stopped by April's, no one answered. So... Hm. I'm sure she's fine. You want to tell me what really went down the day Perez and Jones pulled you over? Exactly what you think. I was an idiot. I was driving around with a van that says locksmith on the side. Miller, I know. You know what? I know they're dirty. The reason I fell in love with you, it's because you do anything for the people you care about. That's also the reason I let you go. 'Cause I know the way your mind works, Miller. And I came here to tell you, that if you know anything about what's going on, you gotta stay out of it. Okay. But I really don't know what you're talking about. You gotta stay out of it. Promise. Okay. Oh uh, you taught Lindsay how to pick my handcuffs? Uh, not directly. 'Cause she's really good at it. Well, you've done a hell of a job with her. You know, it's been nice seeing the two of you spend some time together. She missed you. I'll see you. See ya. What's in the envelope? Just some narcotics stats Stern wanted me to chase. Fisher? With this and Tanya Saunders' testimony, we have enough to implicate all of them. Tanya Saunders is a prostitute. Sir, with all due respect-- Now you and I are gonna investigate this. I'm gonna need to bring this to State Police. I wanna be well-armed for that conversation. In the meantime, we got a potential missing person's case. Uh, can you find me another witness, besides Tanya? I mean is there anyone else that might know something about this that you can talk to without kicking up any dust? Let me give it some thought, sir. Okay. Uh, Beth? Yeah? Thanks for bringing this to me. We have a lot of cops on the other side of that door who will not feel the same way. You understand what I'm trying to say? Well, the cat burglar returns to the scene of the crime. You're not big on doorbells, huh? You've got some meaty balls for a coward in a mask. Why don't you take that thing off and tell me where my fucking money is? If you let her go, I'll make sure you get it back. Drink? I said let her go. I heard you. I just have no fucking idea what you're talking about. Where's my money? April Reyes. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy, we're talking. Help me understand. Obviously, you've realized you're over your head. And you want to give me my money back. Where does April fit in? I know you have her. I came here to make a trade, but I'm running out of patience. Alright. Money for April Reyes? The girl you used as a human shield? I can make that deal. I don't-- I don't have her! Where is she? Please... I don't-- I don't know. Stop it. I was fucking lying. I was-- I was just stalling. I don't have her. Then who does? I don't know. Zwick! Zwick! I told him to get to the bottom of this. If she's a part of it, he probably has her. That's your cue. Fuck, Zwick! Doesn't anybody use the goddamn doorbell anymore? What the hell happened to you? The guy who hit the game. The fucking psycho actually came back, was asking about... April Reyes. You believe that? Oh yeah. You uh, get a good look at him? Oh yeah. Some piece of shit locksmith did a job for me over the Heavenly Arches Development. Yeah, Miller Graham. What's with the gloves? What the fuck is this? You know it never really made sense to me. In a way. Why am I working for you? Is this about money? I'll get you more money. Eh. I want it all. Ian, buddy... That's not very reasonable. I know. I thought you were looking for April. What the hell happened to you? He didn't have her. But I think I know who does. Zwick. No, it's time to go to Beth. Just give her the money and hopefully she can get you out of this. I don't think April has that kind of time. Miller. We tried it your way. Your way made things worse. I know it did. But if Beth gets any closer to Zwick on this, he's gonna kill her. We know what he's capable of. I just need to think. I think someone decided for you. You sure it's here, man? Maybe he took it home with him. No, it's here. I'd seen him put it in the desk. He's gonna know it was us, Hector. It's alright, man. We need answers. Let's go see what that snitch was so eager to show Stern. And this one right here. You're very good. I'll move my little horsey... Gallop, gallop, gallop, boof. She needed help. So, you helped her with a robbery? They were gonna kill her. They probably already have. Look, I have evidence on all of them. I can take this to the DA, but I need you to tell me everything. And I need you to go on record. No. Bad idea. Garrett could have half the department in his pocket. Stern's clean. Please tell me you didn't tell him anything. Of course, I told him. Oh, no... Well, then you gotta go to him and convince him to drop it. Oh, what? So, you can keep taking care of things? 'Cause that's working out real well. No, Miller, fuck it! You're out! Beth, that night. The reason why I had to take the deal. Zwick planted that gun. What are you talking about? He murdered Kevin. I swear to God it's true. Did April know? No. Just me and Frank. And I couldn't tell you, because you guys were in danger. Zwick made threats. Okay. You gotta trust me. Do you still have the money? Yeah. Okay. It's material evidence. I can take it directly to Stern tonight. If I cooperate, there's a lot that's gonna come out about me. It's the only way. If you help us, maybe we can work something out. Yeah. ♪ Up above-- ♪ ♪ --the moon so high ♪ ♪ --the moon so high ♪ -♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ -♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ -♪ Twinkle twinkle little star ♪ -♪ Twinkle twinkle little star ♪ -♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ -♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ Bravo!

Listen I'm gonna call in some anonymous tip to the station about a disturbance at Garrett's house. - I need you-- - Did you-- Listen to me! You two need to figure out a way to plant that gun on Miller and get the money before homicide brings him in. Didn't see my texts, did you? I didn't see what? What the fuck are these? Fisher gave 'em to Stern. There-- there's audio, too. Listen. What the hell happened here? I caught this one with half her take stuffed in the bottom of her purse. So, you beat her half to death? You want me to protect your money or not? Just not the face, Zwick. Why do you keep doing this? -She's worthless to me-- - Jesus, fuck! Alright, alright, alright! Alright! Enough! Stern heard this, too? It was on a drive that we pulled from his desk drawer. Motherfucker! Goddamn it! That snake Garrett was cooperating with Fisher. I told you we should have taken him out months ago! What do we do? Well, if Stern's heard this, so it's a little too late, isn't it? Okay. So, uh, you two get over to Frank's shop. Grab the cash. Kill Miller if you have to, but I don't give a fuck. Kill anybody, alright. Just grab the fucking money. We're gonna need it. Meet back here at the motel when you're done. You said that after we took care of Garrett, the money was mine. Yeah, well, plans change. And If you want to see so much as a fucking dollar, you'll help me make sure Perez and Jones get Miller. So, you're a private detective? I didn't know they existed except in books. Or else they were greasy little men... I'm not very tall either. Next time I'll come on stilts, wear a white tie, and carry a tennis racket. I doubt if even that would help. Frank's Locksmith Co. Miller, it's April. Where the hell have you been? - I've been calling-- - It's April. Can you hear me? Miller? Yes, April. I can hear you. - Daddy! - Frank! Get her! Lindsay! Get down here. Be quiet. Give up the money, Miller, this can all go away. It's not here. Frank, where's the other guy? There's another? Frank! Daddy! It's over, Miller. All units. All units. A shooting just occurred at 457 Monte Vista Avenue. Shit! Multiple shots fired. -Daddy, help me. -Shut up! Where's the money? It's not here. Please. Where is it? Beth has it. She's driving it to Stern's right now. Daddy, help me! It's gonna be okay, Lindsay. I promise. For your sake, you better hope she brings it back. Please, man. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Lindsay! Lindsay! Lindsay! Frank! Frank, you still here? -Beth, they took her. -No! -But we're gonna get her back! -No, no, no, no. No, no, no... Whose blood is that? It's Frank's, He's dead. Frank? He's dead? How could you let this happen? It's April's fault. She's working with them and they took her. No. All they want is the money. We get the money to them, they'll let her go. You got my money? I have it. Where do I meet you? Abandoned stone yard off Lohman Avenue. You can't miss it. You can't afford to. We're gonna get her. Oh my God. I promise you, we're gonna get her back. Handcuffs? That's a nice touch. She's 12. Yeah, well, you never know. Wait, Jones? Got you a little present. Where are you going? Huh? Hey! What the fuck is this? She's just a kid. This was never part of the plan. You want to get out of here? We need leverage. God, you make me sick. Oh, don't be so naive. You knew what you were getting into. I'm going for a smoke. Hey, look at this. Day's End Motel. That's down the street from where you're meeting Zwick. Alright. So, you go get Lindsay. I'll try to stall Zwick as long as I can. No. April is the one who got Lindsay taken in the first place. We can't trust her. She was after me. She didn't even know Lindsay was there. Zwick has no reason to keep you alive. If you can save Lindsay, it's all that matters. You haven't heard anything about that bomb, have you? That happened on your side of the border. In a place like this you hear things. I heard the explosion. Yeah. Well, this case is over. Easy now, Miller. Easy. Where's my daughter? Nearby. Don't do anything stupid. You hand her over to me, and the money's yours. Yeah. I think you got your order of operations all fucked up there. How do I know you're not gonna kill me? You don't. Does your intuition also tell you about my wife? Wife? She was accosted on the street a little while ago and led across to some dive on your side of the border. Hmm. The Vargas family seems to be getting into quite a lot of trouble tonight. Can you describe this man? A little. Well, the first one seems... Not exactly. April? April? Zwick? Come on. Let's go. Get the money. It's in here. Well, get it out. Come on. Quit stalling. One phone call, we'll be talking about your little girl in the past tense. I got shot in the leg, asshole! April! Where you at? Let's go. Throw the gun over here. You think I'm a fucking idiot? I think you're out of options. I think we're both out of options. Stern knows everything. I will make this phone call right fucking now. Throw that gun over here. Okay. There you go. Finally. No, no, no. Put your hands up. Up-- up where I can see 'em. Come on, come on. April? Hey! Kid, stop! Come back! Lindsay! Come here. -Are you okay? -Yeah. -Are you okay? -I'm okay. Okay. Stay close to me. Yeah, super tight. Now, I need you to sit down here, baby. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Lindsay, stand up, baby. Okay, come with me. You see that car? Yeah. Okay. -We need to get into it. -Okay. Okay? Get down, baby. Where are we going, mom? To save your father. How'd you convince April to do this? Ah, Miller. It was her idea. You're lying. Why would she work with you? Well, we do have one thing in common. We both hate you. Lock the doors behind me and don't let anyone in here either than me or your dad. Okay? And then faking her kidnapping. Ah, there you go. That was genius. Led you straight to Garrett. Oh, you haven't heard? Garrett's dead. You killed him. That's right Miller. She would keep all that money. And I will take over. But here we are. I never believed what you said about Kevin. But April... My brother wouldn't pull a gun on anyone. No. Jesus Christ. April. I thought that you... You thought what, Miller? Zwick might have pulled the trigger that night, but Kevin never would have been there if it weren't for you. And now you get to walk? You get to start over and have a family. Come on. You don't have to do this. I want to do this. You and the monster that murdered my brother kill each other in a pile of rocks. That's what happens. April! Put the gun down. Put it down. You helped us find Lindsay. You've done a good thing. I'm sorry. I never meant to get Lindsay involved. I know. April, you're right. I did get Kevin killed that night. It was my fault. And I thought about it everyday for the last 10 years. He was my best friend. I can't change what happened. I wish I could. And I know I fucked everything up. Including you. And I'm sorry. Two jobs, Mr. Graham. I'm impressed. Your employers speak highly of you. Gotta get that college fund started. How is she? There's uh, good days and bad days. Mhmmm. It's gonna take time. But she's gonna be alright. Yeah, I hope so. Detective Fisher. Chief? Well, there'll be more pomp and circumstance, but figured I should tell you now. Congratulations, Lieutenant. Thank you.
