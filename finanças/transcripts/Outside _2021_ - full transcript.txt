- Hello? - Hi, this is Ivan. Uh, I have your food outside your place but I can't get in. Would you mind coming down? Uh, it's fine, man. There's a button, you just hit. The guard will come down and get you. Yeah, I tried, man, but no one's there. Can you just meet me down here? Um... No, that's fine, you can just, um, - you can just keep the food. - Huh? No, it's too late, man. I can't cancel. I'll still tip you. - Ah, are you sure? - Thanks. The way this guy's been cheating, there's just no fucking way. Maybe we just suck. Speak for yourself. I haven't finished... Fuck! Dude, whatever. Fuck this game. Uh! I gotta go anyway. Gonna pick up my girl and do a double date with some friends. Really hoping I get to pick the movie this time because she's got the worst taste in film. What about you? Any plans tonight? No, I think I'll probably just stay in here. That's cool. Kinda jealous. Between work and shit, I don't get much alone time anymore. Where are you from again? - I live in Seattle. - Oh, right. I think I have a cousin there. How do you like it? - It's all right. - That's cool. Gettin' sick of Jersey, but you know, work and shit. Yeah. All right, man. I'm gonna bounce. - Later. - Cool, later. Hello? Hello? That wasn't cute. Hanging up on me like that. - Sorry. - It's cool, but if you do it again, I'm gonna have to block your number. I understand. - First time? - Yes. Well, it's 500 roses for an hour. That's a lot of roses. White envelope on the counter or table when I walk in, no exceptions. I'll also need you to text me a picture of your place, a picture of you and your address. Sound good? Okay. Is it an apartment? Hotel? It's, it's an apartment. Will we be alone? - Yes. - Good. When are you thinking? Uh, tonight? Hold on. Give me an hour. Okay. Oh, and what should I wear? Whatever you want. Cool. I'll see you then. Hi. Uh, come in. Hi. Hi. I'm Ramzi. Ana. Right this way. May I? Yeah, of course. It's cash only. Well it's a debit, you'll get your money right away. There's like an ATM one block from here. Okay, um, I can just give you the card. You can go down and... You're not coming with me? I've got a sprained ankle. I'd rather just stay up here, if that's cool with you. So, you're gonna trust me with your credit card? Debit. Debit. For future reference, most girls are gonna prefer cash. Sign. Lead the way. Actually, um, I was just thinking, maybe we could have dinner first. It's like two in the morning. Maybe just a drink. Someone's having a good time. Yeah. Is it always this loud? Sometimes. You know, I was, I was just wondering, um, how long have you been doing this? Not long. Do you like it? Mm... I don't really know yet. Is it like a full-time thing or part-time? Listen, we only have like a few minutes left. Do you want a blowjob or something? Uh, no, um... No, thank you. I'm, I'm fine. Just, just talking, if that's cool with you. Okay. Yeah. You're paying me 500 an hour just to talk. You know, a bar would be cheaper. Well, not really my thing. Your ankle's not sprained, by the way. You practically ran to the door when the food came. I'm sorry, I just, um... I just figured you wouldn't believe me if I told you the truth. Which is? I haven't left this place in five years. This city? This building. Sorry, I gotta get going now.

I understand. Just, uh, just let me know. Mind if I ask about the bruises? Sorry, I couldn't help but notice. Didn't know if you just liked it rough or...

You strange little man. So I go! Asshole. How would you know if it was his? I use protection with every client. I'm careful about that sort of thing. And with him? Catherine, if it turns out that you are carrying, have you carefully considered your options? Options? Well, given the circumstances. I'm keeping it! If that's what it is, I'll figure it out. Oh. Well, we have to stop for today. And I think this is the last time we'll see each other before graduation. So I'm going to give you the name of a therapist in town. If you're staying in the Seattle area, he's a really great guy. Catherine, whatever you decide, just take care of yourself. You're so very young. Don't be afraid to start over. - Hey. - Hey, um, Sorry I didn't respond the other day. I was busy. It's fine, I was just, uh, afraid you wouldn't come. Why wouldn't I come? I don't know, um, I don't know. The card is right there. I hope that's okay again. Um, I have to go pee. - Go pee. - All right, cool. Uh, I'll see you in a second. Okay. Hmm. This you? Yeah, I was, um, working on that earlier today. Do you have more? Yeah. Can I see them? I love this one. Really? Yeah, I mean, they're all great, but this one's got color, life. How long have you been painting? Um, like 10 years. Right, so there's gotta be more than five. What happened to the rest of them? I only keep the ones I like. And the ones you don't? You don't throw them out. That's disgusting. Sorry, I just, where would I keep them? I paint like everyday. I mean, they're like your kids, right? How can you just throw them away like that? Sell them. You want me to sell my kids? Yes. But what I mean, like, if I lost even one of my sketchbooks, I'd be inconsolable. You draw? Yeah. I'm an architect major so it's kind of part of it, but I sketch for fun too. I'd love to see some time. Yeah, maybe. Might charge you extra though. What do you do? Like for money? Um... I mean, this place isn't cheap and you've already seen me twice this week. It's kind of a long story. And if you don't tell me, I'm gonna have to assume you're a fugitive drug lord or something. Okay, drug lord it is. Thanks for coming again. It was great seeing you. Yeah, you too. Uh, thanks for showing me your work. You're really talented. Thanks. Walk me out. What? Just walk me out. Come on, if you can walk your paintings to the trash, you can walk me to the elevators. Why? Why not? 'Cause I hate it. So let's kick its ass. No man, she's still a fucking cunt. It's just like, get a fucking clue. Just send me a text. - Stop calling me. - It sounds kind of mean of ya. Yeah, but still. Block her, dude. Send me a text. Don't call me. That's not what this phone's for. All right. Finally. I think she likes you, man. Okay, so you're good with couples? Yeah, that's fine. Perfect. God, my husband's gonna be crazy for you. You're totally his type. Oh, he loves a redhead and red lingerie if you have it. Sure, got it. Lace, if possible. Yeah, got it. Perfect. Well, thank you Ana. We should be good to go. I'll see you this evening. So excited. Great, bye. When I was your age a trillion years ago, it was an honor graduating from a university like this. These days, kids go into it dreading the student debt, which is a shame, but you are giving yourselves the gift of a higher education. Never lose sight of that. All right, guys, I can tell by sea of blazed expressions, I am rambling like a madman. So, best of luck to you. Go ahead at the door and hopefully I will see you at graduation on Saturday. Hey, I've been sitting in front of you all semester. I just finally thought I'd come introduce myself. I'm Tim. Hi, Tim. Catherine, the Great. Hey, Kels. Did you like it? Yeah, you were right. I loved it. Well, it was weird as hell, so I figured you would. How are you? How are things with, uh... Good. They're good. Still planning on staying here after graduation? Yeah, um, he got, he actually got a promotion, so- - Nice. - Seattle for the long haul, I guess. Yeah. I feel like we barely talked this semester. Um, yeah. I've been busy. You'll have to visit me in New York. No excuses. Sure. First chance I get. You wanna come in? Jen is making a batch of sangria as we speak. Um, I'd love to, but I gotta get to work. Right, um, I'll see you Saturday. Yeah, I'm not going. You're skipping graduation? I work weekends. Right. Um, New York, then. - I'm holding you to it. - Mm, yeah, deal. Take care of yourself. You too. Bye. Catherine! Uh, I, I just wanted to say that if you ever need to talk about anything, you know you can talk to me, right? - You can always call me. - Everything's fine, Kelsey. Last time you said that you had a broken collar bone. We've been over this. I fell. Right. I gotta go. Just take care of yourself. I heard you the first time. - Hello? - Hi, I'm here. How do I get up? Down the hall to the elevator. We can meet. Okay. Be right there, bye. Thank you. Ana? Imogen. Lovely meeting you. Come in. Follow me. This is for you. He's gonna come in a few seconds. May I go in. Sure. Wesley? - Yeah? - Come down. He's gonna love you. Happy anniversary, babe. I thought we had reservations at Dors... Canceled them. Well, you really outdid yourself this year, hun. Well, we had an incredible year, so I think you deserve this. And what's your name? Ana. Wesley. Should we take this upstairs, sweetheart? Upstairs is for act two. So right now, I'd like you to get acquainted. Hmm, well, she knows what she likes. Mm-hmm. - What? - Relax, it's not that big a deal, we can get another one. We already paid her, Wesley! Hey! Hey! We already paid you. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Home. I'm talking to you! I'm talking to you! This isn't our anniversary! You don't understand! You're a fucking selfish slut! I'm not done with you! I don't give a shit! Hey, what the fuck? What the... Hey, are you all right? - Should I call the cops? - No! Come, okay, okay, let me see it. - Let me take- - Don't touch me! - Hey. - Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, come in. Um, I'll go get the card. No, it's fine. I'm retired. I brought this, since you asked. It's my sketchbook. - I'm gonna go change. - Okay. These are incredible. Thanks. I've been in sort of a portrait phase lately. - Like this? - Yeah. It's a little bit creepy. A little bit. You play guitar? Sometimes. My ex-boyfriend used to play guitar. We'd write songs together and I'd sing to them. We talked about starting a band, but it never happened for some reason. You sing? I shouldn't have said anything. - Gotta hear it now. - Here. ♪ Green-eyed bird, you're on your way now ♪ ♪ The storm is gone, the weight is out ♪ ♪ You gotta go away ♪ ♪ You've gotta go away ♪ ♪ Whispering for helping hands ♪ ♪ Or forsaken thoughts, they never come ♪ ♪ Find another way ♪ ♪ Find another way. ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, it's gonna be okay ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, between the night and day ♪ Ana? Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I just started feeling a little sick lately. Nothing serious though. You've got a great voice. Thanks. Sorry I messed that up. Oh, are you kidding me? It was great. Hmm. Uh, I gotta get going actually. Yeah, no problem. It was great seeing you again. Yeah, you too. Walk me out? Maybe next time you'll come down with me. I don't think so. See you. Bye. Ana, wait! I left my keys. Gravehitch resident help desk, Melissa speaking. Hi, I'd like to request assistance with a lock out. Of course. Which property is this in regards to? Uh, First Avenue. Okay. And the unit number? - 201. - Perfect. Well, I'll dispatch someone now and they should be out there in about half an hour or so. Please be advised, we'll need identification and payment for the $150 service fee upon entry. $150? - Yes ma'am. - Oh, okay, sure. - Thank you. - Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's it. Perfect. Have a wonderful night. Thanks. $150 to open a door? Did I hear her right? Yeah. Thanks for staying with me. Ho problem. I don't know how much longer I can take this place. This city or any city. Maybe my kind of fear would feel really good to you. No, it's just, you go outside here and people barely make eye contact. Everybody's distracted and anxious and in a fucking hurry all the time. A week ago, I was on the waterfront and I tripped on a loose plank. and nIt was a bad fall too like not even remotely subtle. And stuff flew all over the place out of my bag. I scraped my knee, and literally everyone just circled around. I mean, everyone, men, women, it didn't matter. Then I just couldn't help but think to myself, "You don't belong here." You're just not meant to live around this many people. I don't think anyone is. Kept telling myself, "You gotta leave this place." But I can't. Why not? It's just how it is. Sounds like bullshit. What about you? Why can't you leave? I can. Sounds like bullshit. We should wait outside. The normal way. Come on. - Lock out? - Yeah. Well, thanks for the adventure. Yeah, um, thanks for staying. You really didn't have to. No worries. I really should get going now. Yeah. Where would you go? If you could leave? I don't know. Sonoma. Sonoma? In California. I'd work on a winery or something. I don't know. Just somewhere quiet. I really should get going now. Yeah. Hey, I'll see you later? Yeah, um... I was just wondering, I couldn't help but notice, um, on your back. Is everything okay? Wait! Anna, wait. I just wanna talk. What do you wanna talk about? - Anything is fine. - I'm retired, remember? So now this is just cheating. - You're married. - Engaged. And pregnant. Goodbye. Ana, wait! Ana, wait. Ana, please. Are you gonna follow me out to the street? Take care of yourself, Ramzi. Yeah, what? What? Guess I could go for a Sloppy Joe. Shut the fuck up! Stop honking at me! Jesus Christ! Big old Sloppy Joe with a side of fries. Goddammit, now I'm hungry. Yeah, just run out in the middle of the road. That's a great idea. You gonna let me in? Ooh, she's kinda cute. Here we go. That does it. Hey, do you guys know where the elevator is? Right. The person you are trying to reach is unavailable at this time. Please try your... I could, uh, try here if you want. I already told you about this place, man. What? It was in the text I sent you with all the names of the smaller galleries I thought we had a chance with. I, I must've missed that. How much do I owe you? Uh, yeah, let's, uh, call it 250? 250? You didn't even finish the job. It was an honest mistake. I spent all morning on this. All right. Do you have like a preferred payment method or? Uh, yeah, I got this, uh, little thing. Do you have a card? Just, uh, sign here. Okay. All right. Think you'll ever see her again? Well, she either blocked my number, got rid of her phone, so probably not. I don't know. Maybe she just needed some space. I mean, you never know. Maybe. I'll send you that list and just please - double-check it this time. - Okay, yeah, - I'll check this time. - Yeah, cool. Uh, so I'm free Wednesday? Yeah, okay. Sounds great, all right. - All right, man, right on. - Of course, all right. Yeah. Bye. That's right, baby, fuck me. Harder. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Remember the Julia Roberts clause in my ad? No lips. Just a little something me and my man agreed to. Helps maintain boundaries. Okay? Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, yeah! Mm, mm-mm. Sorry, Chloe, I didn't mean to. Listen, you're a cutie pie, but I'm only giving you one more chance, otherwise you're gonna get zapped. It's all right, Chloe. I promise, it won't happen again. Honest mistake. Don't sweat it. So, where were we? Mm-hmm. Hi, Catherine. It's Peter. I work with Evan. We met at the New Year's party. Oh, yeah, I remember you. - How's it going? - I'm good. How are you? Great. How are things? I've been swamped at work. I haven't had a chance to catch up with Evan in a bit. I hope he's not being too much of a pain in the ass. Uh, he's great. You guys any closer to a wedding date? We're still figuring it out. Cool. Smart, take your time, do it just right. All right, well, see you around. - Mm. - Do you know what these are? - Mm-mm. - Lateral Logic. - Never heard of it. - All right. Check it out. Basically, they're a, uh, deck of cards and each one has like a little bit of an abstract suggestion. And you use them when you're working on some sort of artistic project, like a song or a painting or a book or something like that. Uh, you just draw a card, read what it says and implement the advice. - It sounds really cool. - Yeah. Yeah, you should, you should try it. Mm. You should try it. It's, it's great. You'll love it. Just one card. Seriously, it's... "How many holes?" What? - That's what it says. - That's... Uh, okay. Let's just try another one. Draw a card. "Fluidity." Is that... One more. I'll do it this time. - Yeah. - Okay. Third time's a charm. See? "Marry the flaws." Okay? So say I'm working on that painting over there, right? And there's a little blotch of paint that I hate, - you know, the blue, okay? - Mm-hmm. Instead of stressing about it or covering it up, I go inwards and I embrace it and I take more blue and splatter it all across the painting. and suddenly you've got a giant blue painting that you didn't even know you wanted. But you didn't like the blue. But I do now 'cause I'm stuck with it. You like it 'cause you're stuck with it? Yeah, like it grows on you. Blue? Blue. Those are awesome. - Thanks. - They're really, really cool. Chloe, I'm sorry, just one second. I'm just gonna go... You didn't mention we'd be having company. - That's extra. - Just a second. Hello? Uh, Chloe, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to cut tonight short. Hmm, perfect. Mm. Okay. Ooh, all right, sweet cheeks. - Okay. - Hmm. All right, okay. Thanks. I'll come walk you out, actually. - No, I'm fine. - No, no, no. - It's okay, it's okay. - No, I am good. Just one second. So, you see, the thing is, you never know - who's gonna be at the door. - I'm okay. We don't know, you never know, it could be somebody... Good luck, sweetheart. - Hi. - Hi. Can I come in? What the hell is this? Did you read the letter? Yes, I read the letter. You don't have to pay me to be nice to you. Ana, that's not what this is. How the hell did you find out where I live? I don't know, your card reader. I haven't seen you for three weeks. I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. I'm sorry, I... Ramzi, do you realize how much is on this? - Yeah, I wrote it. - Fuck you. Most people retire with less money. How do you even have this much to spare? Who the fuck are you? Ana, why does any of that matter? - Because it does. - No. - Yes. - Ana. - What? - Ana, you said it yourself. That you don't belong here. Right? And if everything you said is true, then you should leave tonight. Please. You should come with me. Just promise me you'll figure this out. I promise. You know, it doesn't look half bad from up here. Maybe I should stay.
