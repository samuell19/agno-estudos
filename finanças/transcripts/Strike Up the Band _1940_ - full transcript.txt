James Connors, you are not Cab Calloway. We are trying to play "The National Emblem," not "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Yes, ma'am. Well, I guess that's all we can do for tonight. I think you'd better go home. Rehearsal's dismissed. Turn your music in to Willie. Willie. Here, Willie. You know, Jimmy, I'm getting to hate these rehearsals. The same thing-- -...every time. -Yeah. Say, Phil, would you like to stick around and play records? I'd like to, last time we did, didn't get home until 12. My dad was pretty burned up. We'll knock out a few and get home early. What do you say? That's what you said last time. I've been in the bullpen ever since. Well, we're just practicing. Yeah, but my folks think I practice better at home. Anyway, Annie's waiting for me. -Oh, you're dead. -Yeah. Goodnight. Say,Booper, like to try a little classical swing? Can't do it. My family's out of sympathy with these night sessions you been having. See you tomorrow, Jimmy. So long,Boop. Is that you, Jimmy? Yes, Mom. What time is it, dear? Gosh, Mom, I--I don't know. It, uh... it must be close to 11. Goodnight, son. Goodnight, Mom. -How was I doing? -Swell. Say, I'm glad you're here, Mary, 'cause I wanna talk to you. -Okay. -Well -- You know, I don't go around steaming people up. Oh, no, of course not. We--well, anyway. Remember once I told you that someday we might have our own dance orchestra? -Yes. -Well, the dog is barking. What do you mean? I've been thinking it over in my mind. And, well, a fellow doesn't wanna play with a broken-down brass band anymore. You know, the same: He gets tired of that. Instead of the school having a band play the concert once a year, why, we could have our own great modern dance orchestra. We've got everything we need right here. We've got the brass, the piano, the reeds and you and-- Me? Sure, you could handle all the vocals. Oh, that sounds wonderful, Jimmy. It is wonderful. We could make our own arrangements and specialties and play for all the dances. Mary, we could put Riverwood High School on the map. Now, all we gotta do is to get the school behind us. Do you think we could sell the idea to Mr. Judd? -Mr. Judd, the principal? -Yeah. I thought the last time you saw him-- Well, no, I-I don't think he'd hold my past against me. This is big. Will you go down to see him with me, Mary? -Maybe say tonight? -Sure, I'll go. -It's a date. -All right. Be right there, Jimmy. All right, Mary. I won't be gone long. -Hello, Jimmy. -Hello, Mrs. Holden. I told mother about the band. She thinks it's wonderful. You do? Of course. I think it's splendid. Doesn't your mother think so too? Oh, uh, yes, ma'am. She--she thinks it's great. I guess we'd better be going. Goodnight, Mother. Goodnight, Mrs. Holden. Good luck with Mr. Judd. Thanks. That was a fib, what you said about your mother. Yeah. Why'd you say it? I don't know. You didn't even tell your mother. -No. -Why? Well, I guess I'm afraid to. Afraid to tell your mother? Mary, it isn't as easy as you think. It's not just telling her that we're gonna have a band, have fun, a lot of laughs. Don't you see that I've gotta tell her-- I've gotta tell her that this is it, music. It's my future. It's the thing I want most. -Maybe she'd understand. -No, I don't think she would. She wants me to be a doctor like Dad. But, Mary, look at me. Do I look like a doctor? -No, I guess you don't. -No, of course I don't. But ever since I can remember, she's always talked to me about it. Well, I've agreed with her because it-- I saw that it made her happy, but... now I can't even do that. Jimmy, are you sure you wanna be a drummer? Mary, I was never more sure of anything in my life. You've got to be really sure. Why don't you wait and see what Mr. Judd says about you organizing this school band? If he says it's all right, and the first school dance is a success, and you know that that's what you wanna do, well, go to her and tell her then. She'll understand. Because she'd realize that your ambition is strong and sincere. Oh, mothers are like that, Jimmy. Gee, I never thought of it that way before. But you're right, Mary, and I'll do it. Oh, you know, you're so wonderful. Gosh, it's a great comfort to have somebody you can tell your troubles to. You're always so wonderful about putting me on the right track. -Yeah? -Yeah. You know, you're gonna make some man a fine wife. -Yeah? -Yeah. And, well, I'm gonna envy the guy that gets you too. -Yeah? -Yeah. And, I'll never forget what a great pal you've been to me. -Yeah? -Yeah! Straight from the shoulder, a real pal. Reminds me of a song. What song? "Oh! What a Pal Was Mary." Yeah! Yeah. Jimmy, the band has been a big disappointment. -Are the boys losing interest? -No, sir, not in the music. There are awfully fine musicians in that outfit. They're just not interested in the stuff they're playing. When you start playing anything, you've gotta be hopping inside. Oh, it's wonderful for parades and Memorial Day, but... people don't wanna sit around and listen to that kind of stuff anymore. Jimmy, I've been giving it a lot of thought lately, and I'm glad you told me. The band has cost the school a lot of money. Maybe we better disorganize it and call the whole thing off. We're already enough in debt. Mr. Judd, you just give me 60 seconds of your time and I'll brush that whole burden right off your shoulders. Go ahead, Jimmy. It would be a pleasure. Well, I've been talking to the fellows and we'd like to organize our own dance band. Dance orchestra? Certainly. Instead of a brass band, we'd like to have a modern dance orchestra. -Yes... -Well, you let us go ahead and form this particular type of band and give a high school dance instead of the concert, and I'll guarantee you that within one night, we'll wipe out that whole debt. I know it! I've been thinking it over for a long time. If we don't bring ins as many people at the dance as we have at the concerts in the past 10 years, we'll forget about the whole thing. Just a minute. You're going to organize a dance orchestra, ready to play-- Not only are we gonna have a great dance orchestra, Mr. Judd, but we're also gonna have a great singer too. Oh, I see. You're going to arrange for the whole thing? Yes, sir. Publicity, selling tickets, paying off the debt of the band. The whole thing, all in three weeks? -In a breeze. -In a breeze? You've taken on a pretty large order, Jimmy. -I don't believe you can do it. -He can do it. -I know he can do it. -I'm--I'm sure I can do it, if you'll only give me the chance, Mr. Judd. All right. I'll buy the first ticket. Oh, thanks, Mr. Judd. Mary, the principal shook hands with me. -We certainly slipped it to him. -We certainly did. -There's a great old guy. -He's a great old guy. Vision. That's what he's got. There's a man that can see over the transom. -Yes sir, he's gonna go places. -He sure is. -You know what that was, Mary? -What? That was a springboard and he just launched the biggest ship that ever sailed down the streets of Riverwood. You're absolutely right. -Let's take a shortcut. -Okay. You know, Mary, I misjudged that man. Heart, that's what he's got. A lot of heart. Here, I'll help you. Something's been troubling me lately. What? Well, w--do you think "Our Love Affair" has enough punch in it? -Hm? -"Our Love Affair." Oh, well, now that you mentioned it, Jimmy-- Because I've got a new arrangement on it. Oh. Oh, it's a dynamite love song just made-to-order for you. I'll play it. Wait till you get a load of this intro. I've got some chords that are really out of this world. Listen. It starts off a little flairy. Are you listening to me? Then it softens down here. It's violins, you know.

Oh, I don't know, Annie. I'm discouraged. You know, it does something to a girl's spirit to keep on fighting a losing battle to a snare drum. Well, just keep holding out, Mary. You'll win. Gee, Mary, if I were Jimmy Connors, I'd tell the whole world you were my girl. Well, that's why all the girls love you, Willie. But who wants all the girls? Oh, that's great, fellas.

Look, Phil, are you gonna play a saxophone or keep your mind on the gals? I'm gonna--it's only that Annie-- Somebody else is gonna have to pick her up. I can't take any chances on that, Jimmy, I may lose her. Phil, we're playing for big stakes now, and if we wanna get anywhere, everybody's gotta hang in there.

It certainly was, son. You should've heard what Mr. Judd said about the band. He said, "We are very proud of the Riverwood High School's achievements." Oh, he's a swell guy. Did you ever think he wasn't? I always kind of thought he was a little on the old fashioned side. Mm-hm. Oh. Jimmy, careful. You know, you've been nearly dropping that thing ever since you were six years old. Listen, Mom, I've come much closer to it than that. -Uh, Mom? -Yes, dear? When do mothers stop thinking about their sons as being a little boy? I guess never, Jimmy. That's the fun of being a mother. Mom, look, someday whenever you want anything, all's you're gonna have to do is just ask for it. No worries, no landlords, no store. I'm never gonna stop until you have 10 days of happiness for every one of those tough ones. You know, Jimmy, parents live through their children. When you're happy, I'm happy. When you're successful, then I'll be a success. I guess then I just gotta be a great man. I always thought you would be, Jimmy. But remember, a great man is only the reflection of a great boy. In a larger mirror. Mom. You're worried about me, aren't you? Look, you don't have to worry about me. Because a lot of times a guy does things that people can't understand. Things crawl around inside of him that nobody in the whole world can understand. What is it, Jimmy? Mom...you and Dad, you wanted me to be a doctor. And after we lost him, you wanted it even more so. Oh, I know what you've done, I know what you've had to give up to try to help me to be one like Dad. That's why it makes it so tough for me to tell you that-- that I can't. I'm so sorry I could almost bawl inside. But it's just not there. Why, Dad loved medicine. He loved every little part about it. That's why he was such a fine doctor. And the way he loved medicine, that's the way I love music. Why, when I'm sitting there at the drums, I-- I feel as though I'm in the right place. I feel as though I belong there. That's what I wanna do. You want to be a drummer in an orchestra? Well, that's part of music, Mom. It's rhythm and-- Oh, gee, it's been beating around in my mind ever since I can remember. Oh, I'm sure you'd understand if you'd thought about it as much-- Oh, if you only knew, Jimmy, how much we've thought about it. Why, since before you were born it started. Your father and I prayed you'd be a boy just for that reason. And when you came, I don't believe I've ever seen a prouder man. And to the very end he'd clung to that ideal for you to heal. And that's such a wonderful thing, Jimmy, in a world that's sick and suffering. I know, Mom. I-I've thought a lot about that too. But it's the same way in music. When the music's happy, it makes the people happy. And...and when it's sad, they take things out of their lives that made them sad and lose them in music. And then they feel better afterwards. In a way, Mom, isn't that sort of like healing too? Isn't it? All right, Mom. I'll be a doctor. And I'll be a good doctor. Jimmy? Yes, Mom? I was wrong when I said that a mother never stops thinking of her son as a little boy. Why, there's always that time when a mother sees her son before her with a mind of his own, a will of his own, and a heart of his own. And it's then that she realizes whether she's made a success or a failure of her son as a boy. Just now I saw it. And I knew that I was proud of my boy. You could be a doctor, Jimmy. A good doctor. I know that now. But if deep down inside of you, your ambition to make people happy with your music is as sincere and honest as I think it is, why, that's all that matters. I'm satisfied. Oh. You're the most wonderful mom that ever lived. But remember, son, the top of the ladder is very appealing, and for my sake, be careful how you climb that ladder. Because that's very important too. I will, Mom. I will. And when I get there, nothing they could cook up would be too good for you. You know what, Mom? What, Jimmy? I'm gonna make you a queen. Ooh, wait a minute, you're eating too fast. You're gonna get sick. Yes, you are, you darling. Hey, Mary! Yahoo! Hey, Mary. Give me a mountain, I'll crush it into a molehill. Who's been feeding you vitamins? Remember how I was worried about Mom? We had a long talk and everything's fixed, Mom and me are just like that. Oh, that's wonderful, Jimmy. And I've got the greatest hunk of news since the invention of the wheel. You have? And I'm gonna give it to you straight from the eyebrows. -All right. -I found this in the newspaper and it's been burning a hole in my pocket ever since. Listen to this. "Paul Whiteman, America's number one band leader, now on tour through the key cities of the country, has decided, due to the great wave of interest among the youth of America in modern music, to give auditions to high school dance orchestras in the various cities he is now playing." Now, this is the important part. "Mr. Whiteman's final selection will be guest-starred on his weekly radio program on June 29th from Chicago." Oh, that is something. Oh, gosh, just think what it would mean if our band made that program. It'd put Riverwood High School on the front page of every newspaper in the world. You bet it would. Mary, suppose we got to Chicago on the 28th and we gave Mr. Whiteman the audition. We could stay over till the next day and play on the radio program. Oh, Jimmy, it would cost a fortune to get that whole band to Chicago. No, I've figured it out. To get the band there and back by bus, and two days in Chicago, it'll cost about 200 dollars. That's if nobody eats heavy. Oh, Jimmy, that's an awful lot of money even if we have it. Yeah, it is quite a bundle. But it's not impossible. When's bank night? You're pressing. Say, uh... suppose we went over and we had a little talk with-- Mr. Judd. And the school board'll do anything he says. Besides, he was crazy about our band last night. Well, we oughta get him while he's in a good humor. What are we waiting for? I'm sorry. And I'm still sorrier to have to disappoint you. But I couldn't give my consent. It would be impossible for the school to finance a venture of this kind. But, Mr. Judd, if you'd only tell 'em what it would mean. The publicity for Riverwood High School and how big it was. That's one of the troubles. I'm afraid they think it's too big already. I might as well tell you, Jimmy. There have been some complaints from the parents of the boys in the band. Interfering with studies, late hours. No, I'll have to veto this, Jimmy. Definitely. Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you, Mr. Judd. That's perfectly all right, Jimmy. You come to see me any time you want. -Goodbye, Mr. Judd. -Goodbye, Mary. -Jimmy. -Goodbye. Thanks. Well, he was nice about it, anyway. Yeah, but a kind heart will never get us to Chicago. Well, Phil, there's more than one way of spinning a top. Yeah. Maybe the school board is content with having Riverwood remain a little red dot on an auto map, but not me. Why, we packed 'em in last night. We gave 'em a good time after we got 'em in, too, didn't we? -Yeah. -All right. I've been thinking over all day ever since we left Mr. Judd's house how we can raise 200 dollars. -Yeah. -We've got a terrific band. It's hot merchandise. Oh, we'll get to Chicago if we have to crawl on our hands and knees and blow out every lamp on the way. I think Annie's good and sore. Yeah, she's really burned up, all right. Annie. Annie. Annie! Is that all I get out of you, is Annie? -Aren't you interested in the band? -Oh, sure, Jimmy, I-- Don't you realize we've only got six weeks to raise the money to get the kids to Chicago? This is a terrific thing. There's bands from all over the country. -This isn't just baby talk. -I'm with you, Jimmy. -All the way, you know that. -All right, all right. So we've got to raise 200 dollars. How we gonna do it? How about some punchboards? Punchboards, sure, sure. -And we'll give Annie away as a prize. -Yeah. All right, if you're gonna be a wise guy-- Oh, I was only kidding, Phil. We got--I mean, we got to keep in there punching. Wait a minute. Why couldn't we make a deal with the Elks Club to give a dance at their Milk Fund Bazaar? Well, it's only a month away. Oh, they don't give dances at any... Say, that's not a bad idea. We could put on our own show. That'd be different. We could make up our own specialties, and sketches, and dance routine. Great, I like it already. Say, what's the number one Elk? Who is he? The whatchamacallit? Mr. Mollison. And he owes my dad money. That's our man. -I'll get after it right away. -Mr. Mollison, huh? Gotta make a list down here, we gotta get costumes. Got Mollison. Mollison. You know what, Jimmy? What? I think I oughta call Annie. You're still making Valentines again. When Annie's sore at me, it throws me all off-key. Oh, I can't stand talking to a guy with a one-track mind. Well, wait'll you're in love with somebody. You'll know what I'm going through. Ah, women to me are just...people. Oh, Miss Hodges, I'm sorry to disturb you. It's perfectly all right, Mr. Judd. I'd like you to meet our new student, Barbara Frances Morgan. How do you do, Barbara Frances? I'm delighted to know you, Ms. Hodges. My, what a nice, bright classroom. Mr. Morgan wants Barbara Frances to finish out the term here. I've selected this as her home room. We're happy to have her. I'm sure you won't have any difficulty getting into the swing of things. I'm sure I won't. Thank you, Miss Hodges. Don't mention it. Now, let me see. Where shall we put you? Oh, yes. Suppose you sit in that empty chair over there. Thank you. And if you're happy there, you may keep it permanently. I'm sure I will be. She's touched it up. Yeah. Oh, James, I wonder if you'd take Barbara Frances to the supply room and help her with her textbooks. Would it inconvenience you, terribly? No. Not at all. Have you traveled very much? Uh, me, travel? Yes, travel. Well, a little. Uh, that is, my uncle took me to Chicago three years ago to see the World Series. Oh, no. I mean the continent. Which one? Oh, you must see the Riviera. Must I? Cannes, Nice, Saint-Raphael, Juan-les-Pins. Juan-les-Pins is simply wild. -It is, huh? -Mm-hm. I met the most wonderful man there. Almost too beautiful. But he turned out to be a duke, and you know what they are. Yeah, you...you've gotta watch those dukes. Oh. There goes the bell. We're gonna be late for our classes. Oh, dear. And we were just getting to know each other. You're cute. Are you going right home now, Mary? No, honey, I have to work at the library today. Hey, Jimmy. I had a talk with my dad this noontime and he thinks maybe he can fix an appointment -with Mr. Mollison for us. -He can? Oh, gee, that's swell. Good work, Phil. Well, I've gotta meet Annie. So long. Annie. So long. Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy. Looking for me? Well, no, not exactly. Come on, jump in. NI drive you home. Thanks, anyway, Barbara, I don't think I-- Oh, come on, jump in. Stuck. Hey, Jimmy, how's the weather down there? Get a load of that. Say, that Barbara Frances doesn't waste any time, does she? How about Jimmy? He's doing all right. Just give me the word, Mary, and I'll slug him. Oh, the county fair. Wonderful. Huh? The fair, are you going? Oh, yeah, sure. I never miss the fair. I wish I could go. Well, why can't you? Well, I don't know many young people, and a girl can't very well go there alone. Oh. I wouldn't worry about that if I were you, somebody'll ask ya. Oh, Jimmy, isn't that sweet of you? Oh, no, no, well, I can't-- You're really a dear. You have the cutest way of saying things. Hello, Mary. Hello, Jimmy. Whatcha doin'? Just putting these books away. Gosh, there's an awful lot of 'em, aren't there? Yeah. You read 'em all? Only up to here. Mary, about that fair, uh... Oh. What about it? Well, I--I thought that you and I we had an understanding that we were going together to the fair. Yes. Well, I got myself all tied up and...and... Oh. Oh. Oh, there was really no definite understanding that we were going together. Besides, I'm pretty busy. And fairs, they're just-- just a bunch of livestock and a merry-go-round. I've seen all that. Besides, they're really for children. Oh, you wouldn't like anything like that, huh? Oh, I'd like it all right, but... there are a lot more important things in life than going to fairs with people. Sure, sure, sure, there are. Well, I--I guess I'd better get going. I just thought I'd drop in and explain it to you. I knew that you'd understand. Oh, sure, I understand. You can always count on me, Jimmy. Just the same as you could your own cousin. Yeah, and I--I appreciate it too. Well, well, so long. So long...pal. Mary, where can I find a copy of Romeo and Juliet? It's right back there with the rest of the Shakespeare, -on the last shelf. -Thanks. Where's Antony and Cleopatra? Right back there, leaning on Romeo and Juliet. Mary, have you ever heard of a book called Indian Love Lyrics? Yes. Well, I want to read it. Well, it's all yours. It's over there in the Poetry section. I beg your pardon, miss. I wonder if you could help me find a book. What is it? The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Thanks, brother. It's right over there in the History section. Thank you.

There you are. Change out of five dollars, please. Five dollars? That's the biggest bill I've seen here this afternoon. There's one, two, three, four. -Thank you. -Change in the five. As I said before we have a... He was coming down the street in an awful hurry when I stopped him and told him we gotta see Mr. Mollison in an hour and he turns and says, "Phillip, you'll have to take over I've got some awfully important business this afternoon." "Important business," the guy's gone stark, raving mad. Nothing's gonna keep us from getting the band to Chicago. We'll see Mr. Mollison ourselves, today. That won't do any good. Jimmy's the only one who can tell him the kinda show we're gonna put on. If we could only get him away from that fair. I'll get him away. You'll get him away. Just when everything-- I can get him to leave the fair. You can get him to leave the fair? How, Willie, how? He'd have to, if he ran out of money, wouldn't he? All right, folks. Come on, now. Who's next? Ha-ha! You've gotta do better than that. Missed me again. That curve's not working at all. Oh, yeah? Well, give me six more and keep track of 'em. Thattaboy, Jimmy. You can hit him. -Hold my coat, Willie. -Sure. All right, folks! All right, come on, son. Do better than you did last time. Oh, no, you missed him again. Try again. Oh, no. You've gotta come much closer than that. You're too far away. Here, would you like to hold this for a second? Oh, sure. Son, I got a mosquito in my back yard that hits harder than that. How much do I owe you? A dollar and a quarter. Soon as I get my wallet. Where's my wallet? Are you kidding? Now I'm gonna get that wallet routine? Honest, mister, I had it right here in my pocket. -Willie! Where's Willie? -He was here a minute ago. Hey, Willie! -Okay, we can handle guys like you! -Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, mister. I've got the money. Jimmy Connors. Jimmy! Jimmy, where are ya? Here. Here! Here I am! Get me outta here! -Come on in, and start pitching. -Give him room, folks. Look out. Hey, don't do that! Oh! Ow, look out! Hey, Jimmy. The Elks Club is gonna give us a tryout. They are? When? Tomorrow, right after school! Oh, boy. That's wonderful. Hello. Hello. Can I see you for a minute? All right. Are you very mad? Yes, I'm pretty mad. Well, I--I don't blame you, I... I'm sorry, Mary. Are you very sorry? Yeah. She didn't hit you on the head, did she? It wasn't a she, it was a-- uh, accident. Oh. But--but look, Phil told me how great you were with Mr. Mollison and the Elks Committee. Well, we had to do it today. You weren't here. No, I wasn't here. I was supposed to take you to the fair, but no, I don't do that. I take five dollars I saved up to buy music with and I throw it away like I was a millionaire. I want a great band. I want 'em to be a success more than anything in the world and I go rolling off like a rubber tire just when they need me. Why do I do things like that? Because you're stubborn, that's why. Just because you got a pair of long pants on, you think you know everything. But you don't have to go around doing things like that. -Well, why don't you tell me when I-- -Me? Look, you're gonna have to figure out your own problems. After all, you can't carry somebody around for the rest of your life to keep telling you when you're off the track. Can you? No, I can't do anything like that. It's just that, I thought maybe you and me could work in a closer cooperation with each other, that's all. You mean, sort of like a pal? No, it's-- it's a little more than just a pal. Well, what I mean is that-- well, Mary, couldn't you be my girl without-- without us getting silly about it? Oh, you're-- you're gonna have to work out your own personal problems. I've got more important things to think about. You don't wanna be my girl? Look, from now on, we're business partners. And whatever work we do together is for the success of the band. But, let's keep very impersonal about the whole thing. Sure. Sure, if that's the way you want it, Mary. -Then, we gotta move fast. -Yeah. You remember the day we were up in the attic looking at all those old-fashioned clothes my mother and dad used to wear? Oh, yeah, with the high silk toppers, the long dresses and the puffed sleeves? Yes. Well, remember you thought it'd be a good idea to use 'em in a show? And we went down and talked to my dad, and he told us about all old melodramas? Yeah, he told us how the actors used to ham it up with the broad gestures and the asides to the audience and the business with the cape. Oh, but he said that was really acting in those days. Remember that melodrama we wrote with old things in it, but we never got a chance to put it on? -Sure, I remember. -Well, that's it, that's the show I told Mr. Mollison about. You did? What'd he say? He thought it was great. -That's wonderful. -It's more than wonderful, Jimmy, because Mr. Mollison wasn't just being nice. He was sold on the idea. I know if we do well in the tryout tomorrow, we can get the Elks Club to furnish scenery and costumes. Gosh. You think we could? We gotta knock 'em off their feet. Why, it's laying right in our lap. You could play Nell. And you play Mr. Goodpenny, the one who falls in love with me. Of course, he's supposed to be handsome but you could always use a little makeup. -Sure. -Who's gonna play the villain? -The what? -The villain. Uh... I know. Phillip, with that trick laugh of his. You know, "Bwah-hah." Why, he'd be a natural for Squire Poultice. That'll be great. And who and we gonna get to May La Belle Francais'? La Belle Francais... -She has to be blonde and giggly. -Yeah. Kind of a glamour girl. Thinks all the men in the world are madly in love with her? -That's it. -What's the matter with Barbara Frances? No. No, no. Not in my show. Wait a minute, fella. Our show. Look, she's just the type. She's gonna play the part. -She is, huh? -Yes. All right, but it's gonna be awfully embarrassing. Oh, Jimmy. This is a show we're putting on. It's gotta be the greatest thing that ever hit Riverwood. You're right, Mary. We've gotta have a great show with a million laughs and color. And a lot of lights to make it sparkle. And songs. Wonderful songs, with you out there selling them. Oh, it'll be wonderful. And after we get the people in that hall we gotta start them laughing right away. Can't you just see it, Mary? The people are just packing in. Why, there's not a seat left in the house. Why, the overture's starting, the house lights are going down. -We're ready to go. -On stage. -Lights.

Dad's giving me a party at the country club next Saturday night. Will you come? Uh...why, I'd-- I'd love to. That's if I'm gonna be in town. Oh, I'm so glad. The only trouble is, I haven't been able to make up my mind about the music. You haven't hired a band yet? No, but I must decide before I see my father. Oh, sure, you do. Well, uh, maybe I could help you decide. You might drive home with me and talk to Dad. He'll be there. I'd hate to spoil your evening-- Oh, no, no. Not at all. Hey, kids! I'll see you later. I've got some important business to attend to. Hey, Willie, take care of Mary, will you? Slide over. But, Jimmy. Some birds just gotta be shot twice before they stop flying.

What is it, Willie? There's something I've wanted to ask you for an awful long time. Yes? Whenever I had the opportunity, I never had the courage. Whenever I had the courage, I never had the opportunity. Now I got both. Willie, what is it? Will you marry me? Huh? I don't expect you to give me an answer right away. Oh. But Willie-- It isn't as if I just met you. I remember the first day I saw you. You were wearing gym bloomers. I was just getting out of Julius Caesar and you were laughing. Oh, Willie, you're the cutest-- Oh, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I'll always love you and I'll be true to you and I won't go out with other girls. Oh, Willie. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me in my whole life. And I'm very grateful. But... I'm--I'm much too young to think of getting married. Of course I'm not in any particular hurry. Willie, how old are you? Thirteen going on 14. -Willie. -Yes, ma'am? Your mother phoned and wants you to come home. She says it's time for you to go to bed. Good night, Willie. Night. This is my favorite room in the house. It is? Someday, I'm gonna have an enormous yacht. Wouldn't you love to go to the South Seas? Yeah, it might be nice in the wintertime. There aren't very many good-looking boys in this town, are there? Here, Jimmy, drink this. All right now? Yeah. Just got my pipes tangled up. You know, Jimmy, when I look back and remember the thousands of dates I've had with so many different boys. When I think of the time I've wasted, the empty hours. Oh, I--I--I wouldn't say that. James. Do you really want to kiss me? Huh? Oh, Barbara? Who--who's that? Oh, it's Mother and Dad. They're back. -Oh, hello, darling. -Hello, Mother. -My dear. -Hello, Dad. Hello. Well, what's this? Another young man? Dad and Mom, I want you to meet a very talented musician and one of my dearest friends, James Connors. -How are you? -How do you do, Mr. Morgan? -How do you do? -Mrs. Morgan. What do you play, young man? I kinda mess around with the drums a bit. James has the most wonderful orchestra in the whole world. And he's volunteered to play for my birthday party for only 50 dollars. Isn't that wonderful? Well, that's very nice of you, Mr. Connors. But, uh, Barbara, I wish I'd known about this before. - Why, Dad? - Well, I'm afraid I've made other arrangements. But, Dad, I promised James. We play fine music, Mr. Morgan. We do an awfully good job. I'm sure of that, son. But, uh, I've already signed the contract. Oh, I see. But we want you to come to the party. Especially if you're a musician, then you can bring your whole orchestra. That's kind of you. Mrs. Morgan. I don't know if we can make it or not, but we'll try - I hope so. - How about a Coke? Thanks. We'll get to your band. The market's going up. Going to have a lot of parties. -Sure. -Now, don't you worry about it. We want to have you try and be there. It isn't every day you get a chance to hear Paul Whiteman. -Paul Whiteman? -Oh, yes. He'll be winding up his tour near here and, uh-- Paul Whiteman, here? Yes. We had a hard job getting him. But, I have a lot of good friends. Paul Whiteman in Riverwood? Oh, thanks. Thanks. We'll--We'll be there. Just try and keep us away. Ha-ha! Paul Whiteman! Paul Whiteman! Well, goodbye, every-- Oh, pardon me. Glad to have met you, Mrs. Morgan. You too, Mr. Morgan. I mean, Mrs. Morgan. You know what I mean anyway. Ha! Oh! Oh! Sorry. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Ha-ha! Goodbye. And we'll be there too. Yes, sir! Ha-ha! In behalf of Mrs. Morgan and myself, I want to welcome all of Barbara Frances' friends to her 18th birthday party. We also want to welcome Mr. Whiteman and his band. And tell them we are glad to have them with us. Oh, ho-ho! Oh! Thank you and we're mighty glad to be here too. And now, I want you to have the very best of good times. Paul, it's all yours. Say, your old man's all right. What did you expect him to be? How about this dance, Mary, huh? Thanks, I'm kind of wondering about Willie. You haven't seen him dancing, have you? No. The last time I saw him, he was hanging around the porch. Oh, Thanks. I--I think, I'd better go find him. He's kind of shy, you know. We want him to have a good time, don't we? Oh--oh, sure we do. They certainly are swell. We've got just as good a brass section. Just as loud anyhow. Yeah, only they push the valves down at the same time. Hello, Willie. What are you doing out here? Nothing. Well, come on inside and let's dance. No, thanks. Willie, you've acted awfully funny ever since the night of the show. Is there anything wrong? I got things on my mind. Oh. Well, I won't bother you then. Willie, you're not mad at anything, are you? Oh, no, I'm not mad. -Oh, well, that's swell. -Ooh! Willie, what's wrong? It's just my arm. It hurts something awful. -Your arm? -Don't, please. Don't touch it. Willie, maybe you should go home. I don't wanna miss all the fun. Have you seen a doctor? They don't know nothing. Oh, Willie, that's very foolish. If there's something wrong, you should have it looked at. Promise me you'll go see a doctor tomorrow morning. Okay, I'll go, but it won't do any good. But nevertheless, you promised. Yeah. Well, let's go on inside and watch, huh? Come on. Hey, kids. I just met Paul Whiteman! -You did? -Oh, wow! Swell, Phil. Jimmy, take a load of that tenor sax. No wonder he can make it moan. Yeah, and he didn't win that clarinet at a raffle either. Gosh, I'd sure like to take a feel of those sticks. It wouldn't hurt anybody, would it? No, go ahead, Jimmy. Go ahead. Sure. Go on. Oh, gee, do you think he should? Sure. It can't do any harm. Oh, I don't know. Oh! Hey, Leonard, what a set of skins. Yeah. Gosh, with a set of drums like these, a guy could get in the White House. Boy, if I owned this, I'd-- I'd just sit around all day and look at it. Beauty. Just as easy. Look, Jimmy. Isn't this a honey? Gosh, it sure is. Gee, I never felt more in the mood. -Me neither. -Yeah! Say, it wouldn't do any harm to knock out a couple? No. I don't think so.

Think it over and let me know in the morning. -I'm at the Wentworth. -The--the Wentworth. Well, I don't have to think it over. Why, I'd just have to tell my mom and I could phone you in the morning. Say, about 7:30? That's okay, but I do think 10 would be better. Ten o'clock. Oh, gosh. Thanks a lot, Mr. Whiteman. Gee. You're on the level? I'm on the level, Jimmy. Oh, gosh. Well, thanks. I'll phone you the first thing in the morning. Good night. Hey, Mom. Mom! Mom. Mom, you awake? Jimmy, what on earth--? Mom, it's happened. I told you. We're on our way. I've got a job. Job? Why, Jimmy, what do you mean? Mr. Whiteman heard our band tonight. Paul Whiteman, Mom! He's offered me a regular job with an orchestra in New York. -All of our troubles are over. -Oh, Jimmy! I'm so glad for you, son, and I'm so proud. Oh, gosh, Mom, just think of it. New York. Oh, that's right. You said you'd be going to New York right away. Yeah. Have you told Mary and Phillip? Well, I thought I'd wait until I got the whole thing set. I've gotta see Mr. Whiteman tomorrow morning. I wonder what they'll say. Why, they'll... -Why? -And the band. Everybody's looking forward so to going to Chicago. Everybody's been working so hard. Working for the whole group. I--I know what you're thinking but-- Do you? I remember when you started the band. When you told me that they believed in you, had faith in you to stick by you. And what suddenly happens to them now? They're the same people. But this is my one big chance. I...I can't give it up. Don't ask me to. You'd be climbing the first rung of the ladder by walking out on your friends. Yeah, I... I know it now. I guess I just didn't stop to think. I thought it'd be wonderful for both of us. And so it can be, Jimmy. But not quite so fast. Where are you going, son? You know where I'm going. So I'm afraid I won't be able to accept the job, Mr. Whiteman. I thought I could, but... I just got through talking to my mother and... well, she straightened me out on a few things. Mothers have a knack at that sort of thing, don't they, Jimmy? Yes, sir. You know, ever since you made that announcement about a guest appearance on your broadcast, why-- why, that's been our ambition. We played dates. We even gave a show to raise money to get to Chicago to give an audition. But that's before we knew you were coming here. Jimmy, did you form that band? Yes, sir. I kind of cooked it up. But I can't very well pull out on them now. That's good enough for me. Jimmy, let me tell you something. When I started to be a musician, a band was a bunch of boys with instruments who got together and kind of beat out rhythm for the rest of folks to dance to. But now it's a profession, and a mighty important one. Take the big bandleader of today. He's almost a household word. He's as well-known as your biggest picture actor or your most popular baseball player. Fred Waring, Kay Kyser, Glenn Miller. All very popular. But once they were a little guy called Jimmy Connors who... just sort of cooked things up. But with this popularity comes a great responsibility. Rhythm can either excite the worst in us, or bring out the best. Take that little fellow on the street, Jimmy. Teach him to blow a horn and he'll never blow a safe. You know, rhythm is really a wonderful thing. Sometimes I think rhythm almost runs the world. In a little baby, the first thing that starts is his rhythm. His little heart starts to beat. And every different city has a different kind of rhythm. And in your car, if the engine's missing and jerking or you feel the bump of a flat tire, it's the rhythm that tells you something's wrong. And if you call a doctor, the first thing he does is check your rhythm. He feels your pulse to find if your rhythm is solid and your beat's strong. 80, Jimmy, when we get to the last eight bars of the big tune and the old ticker kind of slows down, no matter what's wrong with us, the last thing to stop is our rhythm. Jimmy, after listening to a lot of young bands all over the country, I don't think it'd be fair to select one band and give them the guest spot on that show. No, there's too many good ones. I've put up a 500 dollar prize and I'm gonna devote my whole program for a high school band contest. And Jimmy, I'm gonna play it safe. I'm gonna let the public worry about who's best. Gosh, that sounds terrific, Mr. Whiteman. I've already selected three bands, but... I think I'll make it four. Do you want to try? Oh, do we? Chicago, Saturday night. Will you be there? Why--why, you couldn't keep us away. Oh. What's the matter, Jimmy? Oh, I... I forgot, Mr. Whiteman. It's gonna cost us 200 dollars to get the band to Chicago. I've figured it out. We've only got 150. Mr. Whiteman, do you think you could see your way clear to give me a loan of 50 dollars? I'll give you my personal note. What have you got for collateral, Jimmy? Well, I... I could put up my drums. And they mean more to me than anything in the world. You'd really do that, Jimmy? Yes, I would, Mr. Whiteman. -It's a deal. -Oh. -There you are. -Oh, gosh. Thanks. Gee, you won't have to wait long for this, not if there's a 500 dollar prize. I wouldn't be too confident, Jimmy. You might get a little competition. Oh, we're not afraid of a bunch of kids from high school. Hurry up, you're late. Is everybody here? -Yeah, but music hasn't been passed. -Where's Willie? -He isn't here. -I'll scalp that midget. -Run over the old ones and I'll get him. -Okay. Jimmy! Mrs. Brewster phoned, Willie's terribly sick. The doctor's there and she wants us to come over right away. What? Let's get going. Oh. I'm so glad you've come. I'll call the doctor. Oh, I'm afraid it's awfully serious. I hope not. What's the matter, doctor? From what I gather, he must have injured his arm when he was swung up on that wire during your show at the Elks Cub. -His arm. -Of course, it's perfectly possible for him to have gone around all this time without knowing the arm was broken. That often happens, you know. Unfortunately, what was a simple fracture then has developed into a serious complication now. And it is serious. He's had that injury for over a week. What are you doing for him? There's not much that I can do, Jimmy. It calls for an operation by someone who is an expert. -Or else... -Or else what? Unless that boy is operated on within the next few hours, I... Well, I can't be responsible for him. Oh, no. Well, we've gotta do something. You're right, son. I've phoned the best orthopedic man I know. Dr. Ganglin at the General Hospital in Chicago. But he's operating today, and can't possibly get away. That leaves us only one alternative. We've got to get Willie to Chicago. Well, all right, let's get him there. Yes, get him there. But we've got to get him there immediately. Well, couldn't we charter a plane? That would cost a lot of money Mary, and, I'm afraid Mrs. Brewster could hardly afford that. How much would it cost, doctor? About 200 dollars. Call the airport. We have the money. Two hundred dollars? Well, what are you waiting for? All right, I'll take care of it. Doctor, could we see Willie now, please? Yes, I think you should. Oh, Mrs. Brewster, could I see you a moment? Hello, shortstop. I heard you. I'm not going. Going where? In that airplane. Oh, but you've gotta go. I know where you're getting the money. And you're not gonna spend it on me. What's money? It's like corny saxophone players, you can shake it out of trees. Look, Willie, I'm your friend, aren't I? Yeah. And Jimmy's your friend too, isn't he? Yeah. Well, have we ever asked you to do anything that wasn't good for you? Look, Willie. Jimmy's the boss. And the only reason we've gotten anywhere with the band is because we've listened to him. And everybody's always done what he's asked us to. Even hard things. Things that we sometimes didn't agree with. But the only reason the band has done anything, the-- the show and the play and the dance. Well, those were little things. And now, don't you see, Willie? You're giving us a chance to do a big thing. Why, to Jimmy and me and every person in the band, you're more important than all the broadcasts in the world. We've got the rest of our lives to do broadcasts. I know you'll do it because I know you won't let us down. You'll do it, won't you, Willie? I always wanted to ride in an airplane. -Mr. Connors is here, sir. -Well, show him in. Yes, sir. This way, please. Thank you. -Hello, Jimmy. -Hello, Mr. Morgan. Had your breakfast? No, thanks. I don't care for anything to eat. -Well, sit down. -Thank you, sir. What time is that Whiteman broadcast tonight? Oh, eight o'clock. Well, think you could win that contest? I know we could, if we were there. How long would it take you to get your band together and get out of town? L-like that. Well, that's too long. There's a special train pulling into the yard in three quarters of an hour. And I want you to be on it. Oh. We'll be on it. But will it get us there in time? Well, this train will. I've been connected to that railroad for 20 years. This is the first time I've ever had any fun of it. Now, get going and strike up the band. D-do--do you mean it? You ain't kidding us, huh? Oh, thanks, Mr. Morgan. Johnson, if you're looking for that pension, you'd better get this train in on time. Don't worry, Mr. Morgan. This one's got to be in on time. Well, hello, everybody. Here we are. Hurry up. Hurry up, Barbara. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, my dear. -Hurry up. Hurry up, Barbara. -Well, here we go. -Goodbye now. Good luck. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Hurry up, Mary. Well, goodbye, Mom. -Do you think we'll be the best? -Everybody in Riverwood thinks so. Oh, I don't know, this is the big leagues, now, everybody will be listening in. New York, Chicago, all over the country. But they all came from Riverwood. -Yeah. -Anyway, I think you're the best. And your father, he'd be so proud of you. Well, then we're gonna win. -You know what, Mom? -What, Jimmy? I'm gonna make you a queen. Goodbye. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye, Jimmy. Good luck. Time's about up. Three seconds to go. -Are you ready? -Almost. -That's it. -There you are. Connect me with the stage. I have the winner. Come on, girls. You can see from here. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for listening, and for your wonderful reaction to our program. I'd also like to thank you for your votes by phone and telegram from all parts of the nation, which has helped us pick the winner of this contest. Which only goes to prove that this country not only has a genuine love for music, but is happy to acclaim the youth of America. This wonderful enthusiasm and fine musicianship demonstrated here tonight makes me feel quite safe in saying that we need have no fear for the future of American music. And now for the winner, a name you're probably hearing for the first time tonight, but which may in the future become a musical byword, Jimmy Connors and his Band. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Jimmy, it's wonderful. Gosh, aren't you thrilled, Mary? Thank you. Here. It's for you. -Me? -Uh- huh. Oh, Jimmy. And now for our final number, performed by a combination of all our contesting bands and glee clubs. The honor of leading this finale goes to our young winner, Jimmy Connors. I'm sure Jimmy's got a few tricks up his sleeve that he hasn't told me about. -Oh, maybe. -Mr. Connors, the stick. Thank you, Mr. Whiteman. Ladies and gentlemen... Well, I--I guess this is it. I don't have to tell you how I feel. If I felt any better, gosh, I couldn't stand it. When something wonderful like this happens to anybody, I suppose you ought to thank somebody. They're not here, but I know they're listening in. Mr. Judd, I was all wrong about you. You'll always be a swell guy with us because you said, "I'll buy the first ticket." And as for you, Willie, you little shortstop, even though you're in love with my girl, I want you to know that we're thinking about you and we want you to hurry up and get out of bed because we all need you. And of all the people throughout the United States who might be listening to this program, there's only one thing I'd like to say... to the most important one of all. Mom. I don't know what I was thinking about when I said that someday I'd make you a queen. Because if... if you hadn't been a queen all the time, I'd never be here now.
