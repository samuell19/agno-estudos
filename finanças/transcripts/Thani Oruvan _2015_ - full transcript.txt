Define your enemy and I will define you. Look at this weirdo standing upside down! Stop! If I catch hold of you, I'll finish you! Listen, Sengal! - Why did you come here? Your wife is going through labor pain. We have to get her to the hospital. Come on! Who will tie the flag then? - Ask your leader to tie it. You are not qualified to talk about my leader! Get lost! Get lost! I regret getting my daughter married to this fool. Look! Our leader has arrived! - Is it? The interview was excellent. That's not enough. - Okay, sir. - Make sure it has my photo standing alongside a party member. - Okay, sir. Seems like our leader has arrived very early. Who here is the most dedicated follower of our party? The one who is approaching, Sengalvarayan. Now, what kind of a name is that? Sengalvarayan! You called out my name! - Come here. Did you just call out my name? - Come here. Sir! - Come on, stop prostrating. Get up. - He worships you, sir. I would've considered myself lucky if I could at least get a close-up view of you. But you just called out my name! That's nothing. You aren't an ordinary follower of the party. Strong people like you are the basis of this party that I've established. Sengal! What happened, Sengamalai? - Would you ever pay heed to me? Why are you putting us through all this in the name of your party? Her water broke. Looks like she'll deliver the child on the street even before reaching the hospital! If we lose her, will your leader take the responsibility? Is this the plight of my follower's pregnant wife? Come here! - Yes, sir? Bring my car, turn on the siren and take them to the hospital! - Hail the chief minister! I am more concerned about my party men's family than the party! Stop the car! Stop it! Come here. Hurry up! Hold on, dear. You will be fine. We welcome the future! Sengal! You are blessed with a baby boy. Look at your boy, Sengalvarayan. He has entered this world in a leader's car! He is very lucky. Thank you for your blessings, sir! Here comes the party leader. Wait and watch what happens if he doesn't allot me a seat! What is he up to? He has come with his supporters. Dad, what is the fuss all about? Our district MLA has expired and the by-elections are approaching. Though our party will win, it's our leader who will decide who the next MLA will be. Hence, all the chaos. What do you mean? Do you think I'll feel threatened by this chaos? Are you trying to divide the party? You will face the consequences if you allot the seat to someone else. - Hey! Listen, as the party leader, I'll make all the decisions. You.. Who are you? - Sengal, sir. Who? - Remember, my son was born in your car? It's him. From Nochi Kuppam, right? - Yes. - What do you want? I came to distribute sweets as my son stood first in the state in junior high.. Stop it! An altercation is going on here and he wants to celebrate it with sweets! Look, don't try to cheat me by allotting the seat to someone else. There will be a proper reason behind every decision I take. My foot! Caste is the only reason behind all your decisions! Better rename the party with your caste's name! You are the reason we've become the opposition party instead of the ruling party. You are crossing your limits! - Yes, I am. If you allot the seat to anyone else other than me I kill him as well as you! If you want to do the people of your caste a favor you better do something else! Don't sell the party! How dare you speak like that! How dare you raise your voice while speaking to me! What makes you think that you can be the MLA.. Rama? Ramalingam? In case he doesn't give us a seat.. We were expecting some good news but look at them fighting here! It's okay, we can capture this as news, too. How can we trust politicians like these? Sengalvarayan. Please take the blame. I hope you understand what my plight would be if I step out now? This isn't my party. It's a party nurtured by you. The party will have no value without me. - Sir.. If you take this blame the world will believe that you got emotional and did it for me! Please accept the blame. Listen, I'll bear the expenses of your son's education! I'll take care of your family, too! It's your leader pleading, Sengalvarayan. Please don't worry. Are you going to take the blame, Dad? I'll take the blame. I'll have to serve a few years of punishment at the Juvenile Detention Center. In return, ask him to give you the MLA post. Bail me out once you become the MLA. It's your mistake that I was born poor but if I die poor, it would be my mistake. I'll never let that happen, Dad. Do you agree? Go tell everyone that you are allotting the seat to my father. Dad, you also go out. 15 year old arrested for murdering a party man. "Look at me, you can call me the mass disaster." "I'm a monster, never ever read my chapter."

"I am an army and its leader too!" "And that's the power of the lone one!" "If the lone one makes up his mind" "nothing in the world can get in the way."

The abduction case of businessman Manickavel's daughter and her friends creates more anxiety as there are no developments in it. Of late, lots of abductions for ransom, are being reported in Chennai. This has created public unrest. Do the kidnappers belong to any group? Or are they outsiders? The police investigation is on. Looks like you have taken him captive! There you are! Sister.. Who are you all? Are you from the kidnappers' gang? Along with us, you have kidnapped her as well! Poor soul! She has been constantly addressing me as her sister. Hello. Who are you? - Here, talk to your husband. These guys have kidnapped us! Don't worry, Sivagami, my brother will rescue you. Don't worry. - Okay. Will you only rescue your first wife? You would always say that I'm your life. Was that a lie? Ammulu? Have they kidnapped you as well? You wretched woman! So, you are the other woman, is it? Stop calling me your sister! Get lost! Mom, she looks awesome! - Shut up! I am done for! - He cheated me.. You said your brother will rescue us? He is lying unconscious here! What? - Come soon and save us. What did you guys do to my brother? Your brother? He provoked me to get into a fight with him. I was running out of time, and so, I knocked him out. Hey, you! - Listen. It didn't take me half an hour to kidnap them. It will barely take me five minutes to kill them. Why are you doing all this? I want you to bring the four kids you have abducted, to the place I say. Or else, you'll see the end of your family. Move! Please come. Sir.. Sir.. - Come. Oh, God! - Hey, dear! You baldhead! I knew you would end up doing something like this. Ask your men to move back! Dad.. - Come on! Quick! Soumya.. - Open that door and round up! The abduction case of businessman Manickavel's daughter and Dr. Ramanathan's daughter along with four other kids, has come to an end. Based on the inputs from an informer, the police nabbed the kidnappers. Shakthi.. - Yes? How much should I set the duration for? Say 20 seconds. We'll manage. Seems like the training has paid off! Okay, bye. - Bye. Good night. Push! Pull! We are relieved now that our daughter is saved. I thank the police and the government. - Sounds great. Isn't it? The kidnapped children.. Awesome, dude! - Shakthi.. What is it? Pal, I am very happy! After looking at the results those sleepless nights rendered.. I feel like doing more of such stuff. - Mithran.. To become a cop, one doesn't require power or the need to take oaths. We become a cop the day we decide to become one. It's your quote and every word that you said is so true! Thank you. - Come on, dude! This wouldn't have been possible without your involvement. We were all like-minded and it worked out. If we keep up this spirit we can make a huge difference. Correct. So, where is the show tonight? Who are we taking care of? Tonight, we aren't taking care of anybody, but us. Get some rest! Mithran, he is here. Please be careful. I involved you in this only because of Mr. Ramalingam's recommendation. Take care. Hello, sir. - Hello. Hi, sir. - Hi. Good evening. - Hello. I have invited you all to share with you an important news. Do you know what this is? The Government Order to bring in generic medicines to our state. Our government and a foreign company are pretty concerned about this. If this gets implemented the pharma industry will witness a huge revolution. Medicines worth thousand rupees will be available for ten rupees. It will be a blessing for the poor and the needy. Are you wondering why I am sounding happy? I'm troubled from within! If we don't stop this immediately you know what the consequences will be. How can you say this, sir? - Sir, please do something. We have pinned our hopes on you. - Yes, sir. We have to bribe a lot of people. The donations you all have collected in your medical colleges the money that you have earned from stolen kidney transplantations.. Get everything! Or else we'll lose everything that we have earned so far. Also, we won't be able to earn like this hereafter. Ten years ago I had met a U.S. citizen. I told him that here, when we fall sick we head to a well-known private hospital. He was shocked on hearing this. He asked me, how a private organization could provide the facilities and the infrastructure similar to the ones provided by the government. It was like a slap on my face. This moment made a great impact on my life. That's fine. Ma'am, I would like to share something. Yes, Janardhan. Mithran is the reason behind my strong social views. I once asked him as to how he had gained so much knowledge. He mustn't have wasted a single moment in his life and that's why it must have been possible. This is what he replied. When Mumbai's Taj was attacked, Ajmal Kasab was 18. The guy involved in Delhi's rape case was 17. Today, all the rogues and criminals in this country are aged between 16 and 17. Criminals don't wait for the right time to learn and commit crimes. But the righteous ones.. Only the ones who want to do good deeds keep waiting for the right moment and situation. These words of his made such a huge impact on me that I've no words to express. Hence, I like him and he is my man. What does he mean by he is his man? Jana, what are you blabbering? Quiet, please. Social views were very well discussed by our various professionals. I know about your night ventures. Tonight, if Mithran doesn't come to the place I say.. What new problem is this? Who do you think could have sent this? If our superiors find out, our posting will be banned. I can thrash 40 of them in no time but the very thought of being answerable to an officer is making me tense. Let's not blow this out of proportion. How about ignoring it? We must finish what we have started. I completely agree with Mithran. Excuse me. You are Mithran? - Yes. Please come in. Hey! Mahima is here. Hey! What is she doing here? Could she have sent the SMS? They seem to be having a serious conversation. Mithran.. Wait. Was she the one who had sent that message? Yes. - What is the problem between you both? Ask her that question. - Hey! I will be waiting at the tea shop. - Hey, come. Come, let's ask her. With the dreams of becoming an IPS officer like my father I cleared my civil services exams and was on my way to Mussoorie. I met Mithran way before I met you guys. "Brush your mustache gently." "Wear your glasses like the boss." "Mix yoghurt with coconut juice." "Build up the mood." - Come on, let's dance. Over to Mahima. "All the Rajini fans.." Come, babe! "Don't miss the chance." "All the Rajini fans." Wow! - "Don't miss the chance." "Loin cloth dance.." Why are you girls creating a ruckus? We toiled hard for two years to complete IPS. Later, we'll be serving you people. Can't we enjoy one day? Hey, a few guys are boozing by the restroom! Come here, first. - Spoilt brats! - Go, old man! - Rubbish! Now, I really want to booze. Do we have any booze? No, right? No matter what, boys are boys! What rubbish are you talking? What do you want now? I want to booze. - Me too! Me too. - Fine, then. Let's go raid them. Come.. - Come on, girls. Come, let's follow them. - Hey, where are you going? Look at him, he has already passed out! How dare you guys booze in the train! Stop questioning us. You don't know who we are! 3 IPS and 2 IAS officers are here. This is a surprise squad. One more word and we'll file charges of rape and eve-teasing against you. Get up! You and you too! Step aside. - Sorry, ma'am. We won't repeat this. - Leave. Okay, ma'am. Clear everything. - Okay, ma'am. - Move aside. - Leave. She didn't mean you. - She instructed us.. We'll take care of it. Now, get lost. Now, don't get all these back to our seats. Finish them here itself. Hello. What is it? Come with me. - Give me the candy. Didn't I already give you one? Get lost! - Give me one more. No, I won't. - Listen, I am an IPS. If you don't give me the candy, I'll get you arrested on charges of rape. What do you mean by rape? I don't know what that is but if you don't give me the candy.. All the fuss you created was not only witnessed by the older generation but also by the younger generation. We should instill only good thoughts in them. Hi! - Give me the candy. - I won't. You guys are playing the wrong way! Is this how a cop behaves? That's how that police officer behaved with the guys. Who is that? You mean that lady? - Yes, her. She isn't a police officer! Excuse me, you aren't a police officer, are you? No, I am not a police officer. See, I told you. Didn't I tell you earlier that you are wrong? You are correct, my dear. A cop defends the nation and fights for justice and also ensures that peace prevails all around. Now, both of you stop fighting and share the candy. Okay? - Okay, sir. - Now, go and play. - Okay, sir. You can have the candy. I promise not to fight. I felt like slapping you for your behavior but then, even that would have set a bad example. Feminism isn't about competing with men in their wrongdoings. It is something else. I become furious when someone points out my mistakes. But somehow, this time I regretted that I left a bad impression on him. By the time the train arrived at Mussoorie Junction I had fallen for him. I looked around for him the next morning but he was gone. I thought that to be our first and last meeting. And with those memories, I started my training. Dear students.. Welcome to the 88th Foundation Course. Governments may change crumble or even topple but the day-to-day life of the ordinary common man goes on undisturbed because of the executives. That's you. The politicians may be the masters but you are the actual rulers. And now, I proudly present before you the topper of All India Civil Service exams. Mr. Mithran from Tamil Nadu. It's indeed a great pleasure, firstly for me as he comes from the state where I belong to. My Tamil has improved, right? - Not better than mine. Dad. - Meet Mahima, my daughter. - Hello. Such a disciplined girl. Excuse me, sir. - Dad. An officer was looking for you. - Is it? - Yes. Okay, Mithran, see you. I thought of telling you more about my daughter. Maybe sometime later.. - Dad.. I think you should continue. The officer can wait. - Is it so? Please tell him about me, in detail. She is the symbol of my pride! Do you know how? She has joined the IPS but believe me, she was very naughty in her childhood and until she joined college. Incidents like throwing stones at the teacher biting off the ears of the boy sitting next to her and what not.. - Dad.. Is this what you've got to say? - Not an issue, it's Mithran, after all. "Love is a universal game." "And I am a goner." "I lost it the moment I laid my eyes on you." "Love is a universal game." "And I am a goner." "I lost it the moment I laid my eyes on you." "This is the time for romance and my life lies in your hands." "As I desperately wander behind you, the world keeps laughing at it." "What do I do to convince you?" "When will you accept me?" "Just tell me and I will change myself for you." Come on, guys, have some booze. "I tried everything, but nothing worked out." "I even tried seducing you, but you.." - Come on, guys. "...didn't even care to turn around and look." - Have some booze. "I get so mad, but I don't reveal it to you." "I changed myself for you, but you never noticed it." "Yet, I will keep loving only you." "My world will revolve around you, no matter where you go." "Love is a universal game." "And I am a goner." "I lost it the moment I laid my eyes on you." A horse is trying to ride another horse! What did he say? He said that a horse is trying to ride another horse! Actually, I understood that but see, I didn't react! "All the beautiful women are not wise." "And all the wise women will cheat on you." "Look at me, I am the only one who is both beautiful and wise." "You don't understand my value as I'm always around you." "Yet, I will keep loving only you." "My world will revolve around you, no matter where you go." Hi. - Hi. Enjoying music? No. It's a news app. Since we are away from Tamil Nadu I just thought of finding out what's happening there. Looks like the trekking plan got canceled. Yes. It's been postponed to next week due to heavy snowfall there. Nice dress. Thanks. Okay, I am out of ideas. I'm used to people trying to impress me. I've never wanted to impress anyone. That's not my forte. I tried changing myself for you and everything went down the drain. I'm not someone who will change for anyone. It's a great deal that I even gave it a thought. You understand everything in a jiffy. How come you are not able to understand this? I think I'm in love with you. I.. I don't know how to propose. So, kindly adjust if I didn't put it across in the proper way. I just spoke my mind. You just said that you don't know how to propose but I've never heard a better proposal than this one. Love. I understand its value very well. But my situation is such that I can't respect it. You don't have to change yourself. I like you very much the way you are. But don't make me hate you by mentioning your love for me, again. Because I'm really not the kind of person who will fall in love. Let's not do this, Mahima. My mind.. It's tuned in some other way. I am serious, so, don't take this lightly. I hope you'll understand. When he is around I know I can't control my feelings for him. At the same time, I was worried that I might earn his hatred. So, against my dad's wish, I discontinued my training there and joined forensic. Why did you guys bring her? What kind of a question is that? I thought of re-entering your life but you just left the conversation midway! Ice-cream! Ice-cream.. - You know that you are guilty! Don't behave as if I've never touched you before. Sit here. Come, sit here. - Hey! - Come, I say. What are you guys looking at? Look here, find out and tell me why your friend left me. If you don't, I'll let your seniors know about your night ventures. Understood? Where are you guys going? - To have tea. Will you keep avoiding me all your life? Is there no end to it? Will you keep chasing me all your life? Is there no end to it? Trying to convince you won't work. I can't believe, he didn't tell us about it. Don't argue. I'm sure Mithran has his reasons. - I forbade you from buying it. We could've saved some money. - You shouldn't compromise on the dosage. - Oh, no! Wait, I'll get it. - I'll get it. It will fetch us quite some money, boss. Hasn't the doctor asked you to refrain from taking any strain? I don't think I ride the bike well. I don't think so. You ride just fine. Thankfully, you saved me at the right time. Look there. Give me that. - What do you want? - What are you doing? Leave him! - Finish him, quick. - Dear! Don't! - Please don't. Let him go! Please don't! Come on. Let's move, quick. Shakthi, follow them. Fine. You take care of them. - Dear! Sir? - Call for an auto. He isn't breathing. Suraj.. What happened? - He is no more. Careful. - Dear.. - Mahima.. There is a hospital right after the next signal. - Okay. Go. Hurry up! - Hurry up! Here is the paper cutting in which they had wrapped the weapon. Darn it! They've got away! Shakthi is on the line. It seems he lost them half way. - Darn it! Shakthi, listen to me. I aimed and hit one of the culprits with my mobile. It has landed in his t-shirt. It's in the hood of his t-shirt. Open the 'Find Friends' app in your mobile. Track my mobile and follow it. It is detecting the signal! - We are on our way. Let's stay connected. They are heading towards Parry's. Go fast. Turn around. - What is it? How did this get in here? - A mobile phone? Whose phone is this? I felt someone hit me in the head. Someone named Mahima is calling. - Switch it off! The signal is lost! - Darn it! Keep it inside. - The signal received last was at a biriyani shop! Let's meet at the next junction. Okay, fine. Guys, we've covered all the directions. That means, they haven't gone past us. They should be surely somewhere in between Mint Street and Chinnathambi Street. There would be around 15 to 20 streets only. Let's frisk all the streets. - Okay. Suraj! Look here. Show me that. It's the same one. - He's trapped! Mithran. We saw the poster. I think, we are very close to them. Where are you? Wait, we'll come down. I have spotted two of them from the crime scene. Apart from them, there are many more inside. Wait, I am coming. There is no signal.. Guys, we have got visitors. Move! Who are you all? Tell me. Who are you all? Are you going to answer me or not? Suraj! Bloody mongrel! Others' lives mean nothing to you, isn't it? Superb! - Awesome! We are solely responsible for all the chain snatching incidents that took place recently in and around Ashok Nagar. In a similar attempt today we ended up killing a person. How could they kill someone so brutally for a chain? Hello! Why did you switch your phone off? - The battery drained. How is she doing? She is still grieving her husband's death. Finally, she fell asleep with the help of sedatives. Fine. I'll talk to you later. - Hello! How mean of him! Come, sir. Please go in. Come in. It's my best friend's place. Hold on. Put your right foot forward first. - Why? That's what he is doing. Why are you confusing him? Come, my friend. Come.. Come. Please come. She is my friend's grandma. Just wait for me right there! Did you hear that? The old lady asked you to wait for her. You are a lucky fellow indeed! Naughty fellow! What is going on? Looks like you guys and that old lady are up to something. Wait. Ma'am.. - Hey, where is he going? Mithran. - Wait. Now, this doesn't look like your friend's house. Oh! So, you saw it? This is my boyfriend. Built to take blows! Whenever I am angry, I take this and stab him. Hadn't I vented my anger on this I would have stabbed you long back. Now, don't invade my privacy. Let's go out. Why did you guys bring me here by deceit? To resolve your love issues. - Look here. I can't forget him. I was away from him for six months, respecting his words. I came to find out if he likes me at least now. But here, the scenario is different. You guys venture out in the night. He goes out alone sometimes and meets strangers. Alone? - Alone? We always go out together. What? Aren't you guys aware that he sneaks out alone at times? Ask him if it isn't true. Is it true? Do you go out without us? Why are you silent? Say something! You guys are right in questioning me but there are few other things in my life which I don't want to reveal to anyone. Mithran, listen. The home minister said that he wants to check out the new block. I've already made the arrangements. - Good. Troop, order. Start music. What is this? Were you looking for me? Are you kidding me? Four days ago, we saw him brutally murder a person. We risked our lives and handed him over to the cops. Now, we see him walking freely inside our campus. How is it possible? I was supposed to salute with pride. But today, out of fear I had to hide my face with that salute! It's even more infuriating to see you behave as if nothing has happened. Tell me, Mahi. I'm stepping out. Do you guys want to join me? Are you kidding? We won't come with you unless you give us an explanation. Yes! We won't come unless you speak up. Remember Ramar who died during the chain snatching incident? His wife attempted suicide and is in the hospital. These are my friends. They were the ones who helped us the other day. What made you take such a step? It seems they won't accept me as the eye witness. They said that the culprit was wearing a helmet and hence, I identified the wrong person. When he walked out of the jail this morning he gave me a vicious look which suggested that I could do him no harm. I felt like a dead person that very moment. None of the cops or advocates came to my rescue. After all this why should I stay alive? What the heck is all this! It takes 40 years before the verdict for a genuine clear cut case is passed. But in a false case the criminal is proved innocent by cheating the law and is released in just four days! Atrocious! After seeing all this, I wonder what we are learning inside that campus! Have you decided not to speak up? You don't even tell us where you sneak out alone. Your girlfriend, who loves you more than anything.. You don't answer her questions as well. After all that has happened you are still silent. Do you have any problem? Yes. I have a problem. Even now, whatever you just said fell on deaf ears. Instead, my focus was on the atrocity that was taking place behind you. That is my problem! There. A couple of minutes ago, the ambulance driver drove down a victim past three government hospitals to this private hospital in greed of earning a few bucks as commission. I noticed that. That is my problem! You guys are feeling bad just because one of the criminals we caught is set free? All the 32 criminals who we had caught so far are roaming around freely. So.. Does that mean, all our efforts have gone in vain? Not even a bit of it has gone in vain. This has been my home for the last ten years. This is my world. No one has come here before. Define your enemy and I will define you. What's all this? Usually it is said that friends are the ones who define an individual, right? Yes. To know about your character, one must know your friends. But to know about your capacity, you must know your enemies. Four days ago, he was our enemy. Ramar, who he had killed was a social activist. I doubted if they murdered him just for a chain. Hence, I was very eager to nab them that day. Based on the information I extracted from there I came to know about the involvement of this guy named Perumal Swamy. No matter how many times we hand the criminals over to the cops he will bail them out. He is the one who hired the killer. But Mr. Ramar.. He got killed because of which one of his many good deeds, no one knows. But I found out the reason when I saw the accused with the home minister today. Perumal Swamy and the home minister had planned to acquire an area on the outskirts of the city for an enormous construction. It was for the same area that Mr. Ramar had staged a protest, citing that it should benefit the public. The area cops put an end to all the chain snatching cases thinking that the culprit has been caught! Now, tell me. Is he our enemy or is it him? You mean.. - Hold on. Look around. Including the 32 crime cases we handled you'll see a detailed analysis of 500 crimes that I doubted and investigated. Behind every crime, there are multi-levels of petty crimes involved similar to that of the chain snatching crime. Here.. Remember the kids we rescued from those kidnappers? They weren't kidnapped for ransom! It was for this. Last month, there was news that 18 children had died due to short circuit in the incubator in a private hospital. Remember? That wasn't the reason for their death. Those children were born with diabetes. I fed them the medicine that I used to feed them usually. But within 10 minutes, all of them died one after the other. I panicked and reported to the management immediately. They said that it was an accident and that it would taint the image of the hospital. Saying so, they threatened me to follow their instructions. The process of testing some new medicines resulted in the death of those babies. The fear of this secret getting exposed along with the other secrets of the ministry and the foreign medical company made them cook up the short circuit story. Mr. Ramanathan, an honest medical officer wanted to report it but then, those kids were kidnapped so that he would keep his mouth shut. To make it look like a kidnapping for ransom they kidnapped other innocent kids along with his kids. This medical mafia is headed by Ashok Pandian. The petty crimes which we look upon as emotional crimes actually has an organized crime carried out in the background. How can we be so sure about that in all the cases? I didn't mean to say that there's always a big crime behind petty crimes. But in the foreground of the organized crimes there is a petty crime which is used as an eyewash. I didn't start this detailed analysis recently. I had started it off when I was just 15. We believe the world is what the news shows us. Looks like I have got to know a lot about such stuff. One fine day I started relating to the news in page 2 and page 6. If there is a news on truck strike on page 2 on page 6, there would be one that states a hike in the price of onions. On one page, if the news is on gold price hike the other page talks about 'Akshaya Trithiya', the festival that celebrates purchase of gold being extended for another two days. On one page, if it's about someone giving donation to a party the other page has news published that one of his men is released. I got furious and started a deeper analysis. We hardly pay attention to the business section of the paper. That is the section that provides news to all other sections. We blindly believe in the news that is in the favor of the businessmen. The brand of water you should drink, the course you should choose to specialize in the charges of a particular treatment.. All these are decided by some businessman. When I try sharing this frustration with someone they in turn, question me asking if it has affected me in any way. That's when I made up my mind. That I should be a lone man. I had to become a policeman to use it as a weapon to vent my frustration. In the current situation it might be the politicians who define the fate of the people. But the fate of every politician is decided by the businessmen. All these 500 crimes are committed with the greedy motive of business. Newspaper cuttings on land grabbing, rowdyism manhandling, corruption and business rivalries. But only 15 people are behind all this. To punish the criminals in these 500 cases, we have 5000 cops. But there is not a single force to punish these 15 individuals. I have an important goal in life. I want to destroy the one who has committed the maximum number of crimes among these 15. The destruction of whom will result in the destruction of 100 criminals. I want to destroy that one criminal. I see him as my qualified enemy! I want to show my wrath on him and finish him nice and slow. In 10 days' time, we will get to know about our postings. By then, I would have chosen my enemy. But then.. How are you going to select him? They are the 15 individuals I was talking about. They have nurtured the idea of doing wrong in the right way and then, get away with it. These three among them are responsible for 80 percent of the crimes. Ashok Pandian. The business monopoly of all the pharmas, medical colleges and hospitals lies with him. He decides which medicine every doctor in the town should prescribe. He is responsible for hundreds of deaths due to medicine testing and organ transplantation. Charles Chelladurai. He specializes in smuggling natural resources. Smuggling of minerals and sand. He tops the list in all the major granite scams. He has robbed the government of billions. Perumal Swamy. The guy who supplies henchmen to all the 15 individuals I had mentioned earlier. The one who does land grabbing, murders and robbery for money. The one and only authority for real estate and contract killers. One of these three.. The one who is invincible.. I will feed my ego and wrath by showing him that he can be conquered, too! In order to stop the inspection in his granite quarry, Charles Chelladurai has arranged a meeting with the resource minister. I'll collect details about that meet and arrive at a conclusion. I can't believe all this. You are just brilliant! Once we get our posting, we all will head in different directions but whenever you need us, remember that we are just a call away. The next moment, all of us will be standing beside you. R. Sengalvarayan, Resource Minister. Greetings, Mr. Land Grabber. - How do you do, sir? Greetings, Mr. Scam King. Greetings, sir. - How do you do? Stop this stupid custom of a human prostrating before another human. I am happy that Mr. Sidharth finally gave us an appointment. He is my son and even I haven't met him in two months. What are you saying, sir? - I meant to say, I was busy. I hardly get enough time to solve the problems of the public. Until the daily crisis of the public is eradicated completely I won't eat or rest. Hope you are fine, dear Siddhu. Did I disturb you guys, Shilpa? What is this? Can't you leave him alone for sometime? All of you are here. Shilpa. I had called them here. A small meeting. Then, I am all yours. I'll be waiting for you. - I'll be there. I don't think she is wrong. You should take care of your health, too. I will, Dad. Since the last two months, these three have been trying to get an appointment with you.. Let me get on with my party business. You guys carry on with the meeting. Is that fine, dear? Looks like you stayed in the lab for two months without any break. I've my reasons. - I thought I would deal with the problem without having to approach you. But I couldn't. Angelina is bent on coming to India. I tried my best, but I couldn't convince her. - I'll take care of that. Sir, I've a concern that I would like to share. Murali got arrested in the Ramar case.. Don't be careless. December 10th is a very important day. Be prepared! Ashok, come here. Ashok, we have to handle this Angelina issue in a different way. Sure. May I? - Go ahead. No, dear.. Don't cry. - Not bad, he seems healthy. He is the reason for our successful medicine testing. It's just that the lives of 18 children had to be sacrificed. Put him back at his place. - Okay. We'll have to review every month. Give some convincing reasons to his parents. - Okay. I'll miss you. I'll miss you. What did he say? - Follow these orders on December 10th. - Okay. Till this master plan is executed make sure you don't get yourself into any trouble. Fine. I'll take care of that. Padmashree Sri Sidharth Abhimanyu, man of chemical miracle. - One can talk.. His innovative contribution towards.. - It's a great honor to welcome.. In the pharma field.. - The great scholar and scientist.. He is well known across the globe. - That's him. What is happening in my life? I thought, I'll choose one of those three as my enemy. Now, I have got one who is equal to those three put together. He is a Science genius for the outside world. But with the help of these three people he is solely controlling the medical mafia thereby ruling the world of crime. Yesterday, our chief minister shows up uninvited to a function, headed by him. Despite his busy schedule, he is attending the function. I am very sure there is some kind of an understanding between those two. He killed the chain snatching criminal whom we had got arrested so that his arrest doesn't create a loop hole. He made use of his body as well by tattooing on its chest, a caste's name sparking a riot in Madurai which in turn, prevented the inspection of his site. Look, what they found this morning. They found a headless body in Madurai. Next, they will find the head. As young scientists.. He talks about the riot he had sparked and earns the applause! December 10th.. He claimed it to be an important day in his life. I will change it into an unforgettable day for him. He might be Sidharth now. Back then, he was Pazhani. I've stood by him ever since his father became the MLA. He was released from jail. He was a kid then. This is what his father asked him.. So, you are back from jail? Now, go ahead and become a gangster. His son got furious and replied I will kill you! You better clear my records and send me to a nice college. I want to study. He is a very intelligent fellow. Education on one hand and crimes on the other. He became his father's adviser. He was an all-rounder, sir! You are always thinking about Sidharth. Suppose.. In four days, we have our swearing-in ceremony. Imagine that you never come across him in your life. Hypothetically.. What would you do? - We both will definitely meet each other. More crimes are committed where wealth is in abundance. His life is all about chasing wealth whereas my life is all about chasing crimes. Hence, we are destined to meet each other. He was born solely to be ruined by me! A passion so deadly to destroy someone! But you are right. I was at the subdirector's office just now. They asked me to handover this invitation to the director. Check it out. Is Sidharth indeed the chief guest? - Yes. Parade march! Parade dismissed! We welcome our chief guest Padmashree Mr. Sidharth Abhimanyu a great scholar and a renowned scientist. His innovative contributions to forensic science.. You lucky fellow.. He isn't pleased yet. He wants Sidharth to present him the badge instead of the home minister. Now, that's too much! - ...the special address. Honorable Minister Respected Officers on the dias and in the audience.. Ladies and gentlemen.. And of course the future of our police force. A question I'm frequently asked wherever I go.. What is the secret of my success? It's actually very simple. In your lifetime, think of one good idea and make that idea your life! Think about it. All the very best. Jai Hind. Now, I request the medal winners to come forward. Mr. Ranjith IPS who has passed with distinction in Cyber Cell Specialization. Next, Mr. Mithran IPS will receive the medal from the honorable home minister Mr. Prakash. Mr. Mithran receives this award as he has specialized in managing activities involving organized crimes such as white-collar crimes financial crimes and political crimes. Mr. Mithran has one more honor to receive. It's the special award for the overall best probationer of the batch which the Chief Guest Padmashree Sidharth will present. I would now request Mr. Sidharth to present the award. Mr. Mithran has topped various drill movements such as weapon training firing, unarmed combat and special tactics. Now, Mr. Mithran receives the home minister's pistol from the chief guest. Beretta.. Beautiful pistol. - That too presented by you. What else can I ask for? Wish you the very best. Do well. - Sure, sir. Even I have an idea. Just like you said I will make it my life and be successful. Congratulations. Usually, a police targets the criminals after taking charge. But I had already set my target even before I took charge. So, there is no time to get introduced. You just have to believe me. - Sure, sir. Because I believe in you not because I'm the ASP of the organized crime unit. I've assembled this team at special request. - Thank you, sir. These three are the big shots of the society but actually, a big threat to our society. Your only job is to follow them 24/7 and collect every possible evidence against them. Sure, sir. It is true that a transaction of 6 billion happened among those three. The amount will be transferred to Swiss accounts and they are heading to Mauritius. We don't know anything else apart from that. On December 10th combining all the three accounts nearly 7.5 billion has been requested to be transferred to our Mauritius branch. I'm revealing all this because you pressurized. That's all, sir. - Thank you. There is no space in the hospital to treat five percent of the patients who are poor. During the waiting stage, the cancer turns severe for the rest of the 95 percent and then, no medicine is available in India, for the severe stage. We have to rely on foreign drugs. Only because of this the foreign companies tie up with Indian companies and play around! The meeting scheduled for 10th December will change everyone's fate for good! You will find the details you asked regarding the same in this file. Once Angelina signs the agreement no one will be able to play around. Medicines worth 2.5 lakhs will be available for Rs. 8000. Medicines worth 50 rupees will be available for one rupee! This should happen, sir. Ms. Angelina is on her way to the hotel from the airport. Sir. - Sir. Please wait here for a while, Doctor. - Sure, sir. Yes? - Sir, ma'am reached here an hour ago. She is in her room. We have been safeguarding her from the time she left the airport. We have informed her that you would like to meet her. Hi. - Good. Hi, ma'am. Last year, when my dad was in India for a medical conference I just came along as a tourist. That's when I learnt about the poor people dying from cancer. The critical cancer medicine KE-27 required to rescue their lives was sold by us at a higher price for 20 years, in the name of patent rights and I felt guilty about it. Once I became the managing director I broke the patent rights for the medicine and made up my mind to make it available for the poor as a generic medicine. Just because of your effort alone people here will be forced to stop the misuse of patents. The rates of the medicines will fall drastically. But the Indian drug mafia won't let that happen. Do you recognize him? He is Sidharth, our Indian adviser. Do you know who he is talking to? Our company's Vice President, James Anderson. This photo was taken when they had met in Switzerland. A transaction worth 13 billion is getting transferred to an account in your country by Sidharth's proxies. Do you see any connection between their meeting and the transaction? There are chances. Sidharth came with a request to merge his pharmaceutical company with mine. Since I refused, I guess, he is teaming up with Anderson to buy 51 percent of my company's shares that will make him the deciding authority. You know your life is at risk. Don't worry. It's my duty to ensure your safety. Thank you. Tomorrow, it's 10th December. A day that will give meaning to the team we have formed. A day that will change the fate of patients who are poor. But this will happen only if Angelina attends the Chennai meeting safely. There is a plan to murder Angelina and to takeover her company. For this purpose, 13 billion is going to be transferred through banks and Hawalas. We will have to follow two strategies. The first one.. We have to ensure Angelina's safety and make sure that she attends the meeting. Secondly.. By arresting these three we'll have to stop the transaction of the 13 billion fund. We must arrest all three of them at the same time! Hi, Stephen. Nice to meet you. - How are you? Good to see you. Shall we? - Come. Why did you bring me here and what's with the new dress? What's up? You bought her the same dress! This is Angelina. - Hello. - The MD of the foreign medical company. She has an important conference to attend today. There is a threat to her life. So what? So, if you travel instead of her in the car, she'll be safe.. When I said I'm ready to sacrifice my life for you I didn't expect you would actually put my life at risk. Mahima, this is a secret operation and you belong to a family of police officers you can think spontaneously and you are pretty talented.. - Fine, enough. You have made up your mind. I'll do it! What is she saying? I'm saying that I'm very happy to do this for you. Thank you - You're welcome. See you. - Take care. Pramod, all set? Mithran. Where are you? I'm following you. Sir, we are moving ahead and everything is clear. Over. Thank you for the warm welcome. - You are welcome. And for the opportunity. I think it's going to be a great value proposition. Sir, I see Perumal Swamy on the road opposite. But nothing looks suspicious. He won't be there without any reason! Something is fishy. Okay, keep watching. Pandian, be alert. - Okay, sir. Guys, be alert. Arrest him. - Take him.. Mahima? Mahima! Mahima! Was that a prank? Yes. - Is this the time to joke? You can make me a scapegoat anytime and I should obey you! I was checking if you were trying to get rid of me forever! Not bad. You do have some concern for me! Now, leave! Has Angelina arrived safely? Sir, she is fine. - Good. Everything is under control. She is in the 4th floor. - Fourth, is it? Yeah. With armed guards. I hope there is no one else there. - No one is there. Everyone else has been asked to vacate. - Be careful. Yes, sir. What's happening? Leave me! Anyway. Excuse me. A call from India? Hello. - Hello. What the heck is happening out there? Are you trying to kill me and takeover my.. - Please, ma'am. There's been a mistake. I've done nothing wrong. - You got to trust me. Once my foot steps on Swiss soil, you are finished. Wait, ma'am! Darn! You said she'll be dead by now but she just fired my.. It's already 10 o'clock! She should have been dead at 9:30. My career is finished! I'm done. - Andy! You got to calm down. I can take care of this. Just give me five minutes. Why don't you go inside and.. - Five minutes! Yeah, I heard you. - Five minutes. I'll join you in five minutes. Shit! Dad. What's happening? Why isn't anyone answering my calls? All three of them got arrested. Didn't you get the news? What are you saying? Won't you keep me updated unless I ask you to? I'm sorry, dear. They have to be in Mauritius at any cost. How will I seal the deal without the money? Are you running out of money? Tell me how much you need and to which account I should transfer it to. You bail them out! Okay, it'll be done. You'll get the good news. Someone, please shut this box! Hello. - Sidharth Abhimanyu. Tell me. - Vicky. You have to complete the job I'd given your brother Perumal Swamy. You haven't given me a job but an opportunity. I'll take care of it. Mithran's team is in control of that area. There is no information on the whereabouts of the foreigner lady! Take right. You don't be here. Head to the station and come when I call you. Mr. Mishra.. How are you? I'm fine, Sidharth. How are you? What's up? I urgently need 13 billion. 13 billion? Are you kidding me? You are asking for it so casually. - Well.. Transfer it from your Liechtenstein account to my Geneva account. What? - I've emailed you my bank details. Why should I give you the money? - You know who I am, right? I've also attached a file in that email. Take a look at it and then, decide. Hi, Ananya. Miss India.. Don't worry, I'll ensure that you get a good profit in your next deal. Fine. I'll transfer the money. We welcome our honorable chief minister to attend the meet for generic medicine with Pixim Company. - Sir. - Sir. The function will start in about 20 minutes. I've informed the chief minister's PA that she will be here in 10 minutes. Fine. I'll be upstairs. I'll get her myself. Sir. You have her mobile, right? - Yes, sir, it's with me. But she made a call from my mobile. Why did you allow that? She can be traced! I'm sorry, sir! Do come in. I can't believe what is happening! Thank you for alerting me. - It's my duty, ma'am. You shouldn't have called him before the conference got over! I know but my own people are trying to kill me! What is the matter, Karna? Sir, Mr. Mithran asked me to get these files. Okay, come. Here it is, sir. What is it? Hey, stop it! Please, don't shoot. No! Hey! Sir. Karunakaran, is everything taken care of? Sir, I executed the plan as per your instructions. Good job! Thank you for the money, sir. Yeah, Vicky? Angelina is taken care of. The ASP who came to stop it is also dead. Excellent! That's not enough. We'll have to finish everyone who was involved in this! Not many. The arrest warrant requested for those three and safeguarding Angelina.. All of it was taken care by a single person. ASP Mithran. All alone? - Yes! "Evilness will prevail, if you think about me." "Evilness will prevail, no matter who tries to stop." "Better think, better go." Considering the good will of Tamilians Ms. Angelina, who had come to sign the generic medicine agreement was killed and I deeply regret it. It's unfortunate. The investigation is on. From now on, whatever you do be very careful. Your life is at risk. I never feared death, not even when I didn't know what it was. Now that I've almost experienced it why should I fear? Good evening, sir. Let me take that. Go home. Give me the key. Why did he send the driver away? I have no clue where he is going to drop me. I wonder why he preponed his trip. I've bailed out both of them including Ashok. I made sure that no LLR was filed against them. FIR. - Whatever. Why are you staring at me? I asked you before doing it. Just because I tell you to ask me before doing anything won't you do anything on your own? Instead of making mistakes by taking decisions on my own I feel satisfied when I make mistakes after following your instruction. That's what you have taught your father. I remember, when you were young, you had taught me three golden rules. First: Wherever you go, raise your head and walk boldly. Second: Even if there is a need to smile, never show your teeth. Third: Unless I tell you, never take your own decision and speak. Only then the world will praise you. You taught me that most of the wise men in Tamil Nadu follow these rules. That is what I have been following all these days. Now, if you ask me to change all of a sudden, how is it possible? Does that mean, you don't have common sense? When did I say I have it? Dad. Even a sparrow has bigger brains. Wear that around your neck. The cops who used to salute and open the car doors for us.. I feel so disgusted when I think about it. Thanks to your father's brains. He bailed us out. Who is he? I was so angry that I could have killed him right there in the hospital. You forbade me from doing so. Permit us to do so now. Until yesterday, even Perumal's brother was unaware that you guys are my proxies. But he knows it. The three of you had no idea as to why I had gone to Switzerland. But he knew it. For the first time, somebody has tried to play tricks on me. This isn't an illegal affair for you to perform honor killing. Sir. I have found everything about him. His name is Mithran. His parents are no more. He is a loner. He became a cop at his own will. There is one place where he spends more time than the police station. Define your enemy. And I will define you. Even I have an idea. Just like you said I will make it my life and be successful. Congratulations. Until now, a lot of people have caused obstacles in my business. I have killed all of them brutally. But he seems to be different. He is waiting to destroy me. He knows where I was born where I was raised what I specialized in what my business is all about.. He has analyzed my past, present and future plans. He has preserved even this. Why has he preserved this? Shocking. And surprising. - My son is feeling really bad. I want to know about him. Tell me about him. I will send the counsel of that area to his house and ask him to disconnect all the basic provisions. I'll seize his ration card and Aadhar card. I will use my power to seize his passport and make sure that he doesn't even travel to Delhi. How is my idea? Imbecile. A small piece of the bullet is still stuck inside. It is better to remove it. Is it necessary to get another surgery done? Of course. It is essential. No way, Doctor. I thought, I would be discharged this evening. This is too late. I have to go. Please understand. It is a minor surgery, Mr. Mithran. I will discharge you tomorrow evening. Hey! What happened? - Sidharth. What are you saying? - Sidharth was here. Don't joke around. It must be the sedative. Please lie down. I saw him! - Lie down. - Mithran.. - What are you saying? Please listen to us. Mithran. Wait. Mithran. - Mithran. Please listen. - What are you doing? I saw him. - Come. - Sir.. - Sir.. Sir, what are you doing? You are on sedatives. You shouldn't strain yourself. - No, Doctor. - Come and lie down. I saw him. He was standing here. - Don't blabber. We are telling you, nobody came. - I am not lying.. Don't keep saying the same thing. - No. I am very clear. I saw him here. He was staring at me. Dr. Ramachandran, this is a GPS tracking device. The moment you implant this, we can monitor the subject 24/7. Also, we can get the audio feed live through satellite. Here. Now, I will get to know of his whereabouts, his plans and everything else in detail. You were the one who said that he is not in India. Then how do you think he could have come here? Even if he had come, do you think he would've left without harming you? Despite knowing everything about him I have spared him alive without shooting him dead, right? Similarly even he must have had a reason to let go of me. There must be a reason. My car will arrive now, Mahima. - You please sit down. I am there, right? Suraj called up from Tirunelveli. He felt bad that he couldn't come to meet you in person. I read his message. Mahima, thank you for everything. Go ahead. You can thank me all you want. It's only between lovers that there's no 'thanks' and 'sorry'. Hi, darling. - But I am not your lover, so, you can say all you want. I will accept it. Your dad is here. He is waiting upstairs. Let's go? - I will be there. What happened? Does it hurt? I feel so uneasy. The doctor has said that only if you have another dose will you get any relief. Okay. I will take it. - In the area.. The next dose is after lunch. I will go home and be back by then. No. You don't have to come. What do you mean? Why are you removing that? I have to go out. Out? Have you gone mad? Where are you going? I have an important work to complete. Please leave. I will call you after I complete the work. Don't have your way always. What important work do you have? When I met Angelina a guy had come there to meet her. When I was in the hospital he tried to meet me as well. His name is Kumar. Last week, near the IT Park a girl was molested and murdered by a few guys from Bihar. Manimekalai.. He is her boyfriend. Manimekalai? Manimekalai. Just before her death, she had sent me an important video evidence. She was a scientist. She was Sidharth's.. Various atrocities have been exposed in that video. I need to handover that SD card to you. Sir.. She kept saying.. I have to research. She was determined to find the medicine. She used to talk to me about it all the time. A girl like her was brutally molested and murdered. They should be punished. I have no clue as to whom to trust. I am afraid of everything that I see around. Definitely, I will meet you. I will get discharged tomorrow. As soon as I get discharged, I will meet you. - Okay. Until then, please don't disclose this to anyone. Okay, sir. - Just one day. I am going to meet Kumar at the entrance of his college. Once I get the SD card I will ruin Sidharth. The world thinks you to be a good person. Sir.. Please, sir. If they get to know that it is a discovery of our country all the medical industries across the globe will bow before us. You think they should bow before us. But I think, they should bow only before me. That's the only difference. - Don't you think this is wrong? Desire for something. Nothing will seem to be wrong. I will not let this happen. I have a bad habit. Let this remain a secret and I will let you live. I cannot say such things. This is unfair, sir. Even if you kill me I will make sure that I expose you before everyone! I placed the bug to know more about him. But I am getting to know about myself. I had thought that the Manimekalai incident was over. But she has a boyfriend. I failed to notice it. I have made a mistake. Sidharth.. - He is not my enemy. He is just a non-salaried servant who finds out and informs me about whatever is happening against me. That is all. Let me deal with it. Oh, God! I will deal with it. Sure. Shall I go and eat now? I am hungry. The number you're calling is currently out of range. Open your mouth and answer. Where is the SD card? Tell me. Don't make me kill you. Tell me. Where have you hidden the SD card? Tell me. Another thing. - What else went missing? Dude. How are you? Jana. You are at Kanchipuram, right? Are you busy right now? Not really. I was dealing with a theft case. Not a problem. Tell me. Okay. Listen. Kumar. 25, medium built. He has got an SD card. It is an important evidence against Sidharth. He has told me that he will hand it over to me. We had planned to meet exactly 30 kms ahead of Kanchipuram. I have been calling him, but no response. I suspect some foul play. I cannot leave this spot. What if he comes? Can you do me a favor? 172/16 Thiruvallur Street. This is his address. Go there by yourself. Don't trust anyone. Thiruvallur Street, right? It's nearby. I will go and check. - Thanks, pal. Call Vicky. Sir. - A police officer named Jana is coming there. He shouldn't get hold of the card. Got it. A police officer is on his way it seems. Search for it quickly. I have been asking you for so long.. Hey, come here.. Raghava. Looks like the police officer is here. Go.. Kumar.. Kumar. Kumar. Leave him. Leave him. Sir.. Please give it to Mr. Mithran. I will kill him. - No. You might be a cop.. - No! But don't you think that I am a fool. Give me that SD card. I'll give it. Give it to me or else.. - I will give it. Please don't give it to him, sir. Shut up! - I'll give it. Leave him. This is Manimekalai's last wish. - I'll kill him. Even if he kills me, it is fine. I am going to kill him. Just leave him. I am giving it to you. - No, sir. Give the card. - Please don't give it. - I am giving it. Please don't give it to him, sir. - I'm giving it. - Come on! I trusted you, sir. Please, sir. Shut up. Leave him. - Please listen to me. Give it to Mr. Mithran. - Give it! Here, take it. Kumar! Kumar. - Open the door. I will kill you if I come out. Yeah, Vicky? - Sorry. The police officer escaped with the card. I will somehow find him. Darn it! What happened? Why didn't you answer my call? Vicky, hold on. A lot happened. Kumar is dead. But somehow, I have got the SD card. Where do I have to come? - Don't you stop anywhere. Come towards Chennai. I will come in the opposite direction. Wherever I meet you, I will take the SD card from you. - Okay. Where is the card? Next week, this factory is going to be mine. The government had it closed, calling it sick. Because I made it so. Had I caught you 2 kms before, I would have churned you in my clinker factory. Had I caught you 2 kms ahead I would have admitted you in my health institute and would have cut you into pieces. This is just 0.000001 percent of whatever I'm involved in. In the last 20 years, more than focusing on my career I've concentrated on not leaving any evidence after committing an evil deed. Then, what made Mithran look for an evidence? Mithran didn't have to look for an evidence. In fact, he is the reason you did everything. To vent his anger on someone like you.. He was born as a boon just for that purpose. Don't value him so much. I will make him lose everything and kill him brutally. No chance. Killing you is his only emotion. Apart from that he doesn't have any emotion. Sir, I checked his bike as well. I couldn't find the SD card there as well. Where have you kept it? Tell me. Are you trying to escape? I will show you. Where is the SD card? - I am not going to say it. I won't reveal it to you. Where is the SD card? Tell me. - I won't! Did you think we Malayalis will easily frame our friends? We'll sacrifice our lives for our friends. He doesn't seem to cooperate. Sidharth. You are finished. I will send a message from his phone and make Mithran come here. Okay. He said he doesn't have any emotion. Make sure his death brings out the emotions in him. Jana! - Mithran. Jana! Jana! Jana! Jana.. No. Let go of him. Jana! Jana! Jana.. Look here. - Jana. I will throw him. Come. No, don't. Shall I? Shall I? I will. Are you playing tricks on me? Come. Jana! Don't you want to see him die? Come out. Your friend is coming. Go. Jana, don't come. Jana! Jana, don't come. Jana. Don't come. Listen to me. Jana, don't come. Jana, don't come. Jana, don't come. Jana, no! Jana.. Jana! Under the influence of drugs a half-naked police officer dies in a road accident. More than his death it's this humiliation that I'm unable to bear. Did he deserve such a death? After this in every plan of Mithran's we will be contributing more. I'm solely responsible for Jana's death. I shouldn't have sent him there. There is no way anyone could have known about the SD card. Then, how did this happen? I'm clueless. I have been doing everything carefully. Mahima. Did you change the position of the pin in the photo? Pin? Why would I change? What happened? Why are you asking that? If you didn't change it.. Do you think somebody would have come here? What if Sidharth himself was here? Don't touch that, Mithran. You have a doubt, right? I will clear it. I am totally free now. In deep thoughts? Hold this pin. Keep it there. If we had Sidharth's fingerprints it would have been much easier. Mahima. Sidharth's fingerprints are there on this gun case. Are you sure? - He had presented it to me. I never touched it. I was wearing gloves when I had received it from him that day. The fingerprints match. Sidharth was here. He has entered my home. He is going to treat me in a special way. But.. Why would he have placed the pin on this photo? She is 2011 Miss India. Ananya. These are the photos of the event. Look at Ananya. It's Shilpa in the third row. Shilpa? - Yeah. She is Sidharth's girlfriend. How is it? - Nice. The one who came first was with him in Switzerland. Shilpa is in a live-in relationship with him now. How is he connected to that event? Check this link that says 'Conspiracy over the event'. Shilpa had more supporters. There are a lot of comments against Ananya being crowned the Miss India. We can confidently declare Shilpa as the winning candidate. Not only that, she has the capability to win the Miss World, too. Nearly 20 leading companies are ready to give the advance. If she wins we won't be able to catch hold of her for a year. That's why, I have decided to let her sign the contract for our company in advance. There's no need for any contract. I have other plans. She doesn't have to roam around the world as Miss World. She should consider me her world and stay beside me always. Before she leaves this place, I should win her heart. Look for some other useful candidate. Ananya might be useful. Make her number one. - Okay. The final round is about to start. Shilpa is all set to walk on the ramp. Before that ask them to tell her that her dad passed away. What? Is he dead? He will be dead. In half an hour, Perumal Swamy will murder her dad. Shilpa doesn't have a flight to leave for Chennai now. Make arrangements for her to come with me in my chartered flight. I really miss him. Kumar 25, medium built. He has got an SD card. - Thiruvallur Street, right? Kumar! - Keep coming towards Chennai. Jana! Sir, your breakfast. Then.. Newspaper, right? Please keep it over there. What is this? What have you done? Why are you bleeding? - Leave me. I'll get to know only if you tell me. Don't ask me anything. Just go from here. I don't wish to see anyone. Leave me alone. We are here to help you. Without Sidharth's knowledge, I have even fixed an appointment with Shilpa. We are meeting at 4 o'clock. We will definitely get some clue. And then? He will find out that as well. What is the use? He is watching my every move. He is taking away everything from me. Dear. What is it? - Read this out. Excuse me. He murdered Kumar. Jana. He took his life as well. I've no idea as to what I'm doing. He's making me feel that way! I can't believe you are doing this. Patience is what I like the most in you. You have lost that as well. If you have patience, you can even get what you lost. But if you lose patience you will lose everything that you have. What else is left to lose? I have lost everything. But I still have one thing. My life. I will kill him even if it costs me my life. This is your problem. When you said that you choose your enemy as per your standards I felt so happy. But that has become an obsession and you are losing yourself. Only if you value your life can you value the life you lead. Even I wish to marry you and lead a life with you. But it's not for me that I want you to live. I want you to live so that you can achieve your goals. You are proudly saying that you will kill him even at the cost of your life. Ask Sidharth to say the same thing. He will not say it. Because you are just one of the thousand guys against him. He is looking at you only as a hindrance. He will carry on undeterred. Only you think of him as your destiny. To you, bravery is killing him at the cost of your life. But you should kill him without losing your life. That is true bravery. I don't know if you have understood anything that I just said. If you have understood, fine. Or else, just do as you please. Patience is what I like the most in you. You have lost that as well. Only if you value your life can you value the life you lead. To you, bravery is killing him at the cost of your life. But you should kill him without losing your life. Even I wish to marry you and lead a life with you. But it's not for me that I want you to live. I want you to live so that you can achieve your goals. Without Sidharth's knowledge, I have even fixed an appointment with Shilpa. We are meeting at 4 o'clock. Hi, sweetheart. Can we go out? - Where? I don't know.. Maybe for a drive. What time? - 4 o'clock? 4 o'clock, is it? I have to go to the beauty parlor. I will come home now. I will join you for lunch. What do you say? - Okay. Sure. I will see you, darling. Love you, sweetheart. Love you too. Bye. I am going to kill Shilpa. Shilpa? Love at first sight. Kill at first betrayal. That's what I believe in. When I first met her my heart skipped a beat. I planned and won her heart. I think, I.. I think, I love her, Dad. But now.. She lied to me. She is going to meet Mahima. That is betrayal, isn't it? Order one cake.. - But still.. Happy Chocolate Cake. One Kg. Cake? - I can hear you. Any occasion, sir? But it is for someone special. Hello. Mahima. Tell me. - Can you come home? I cannot come home. Whatever it is, tell it over the phone. Can you come for me? What is this? There is a change in your tone. Yes. Come. Okay. I will come. Mithran is going to propose his love to Mahima. That's why, he has called her home. I will kill Mahima also the very next moment Mithran proposes to her. - Son.. He should know the pain. He has to know. But for that.. - Only when I talk to you I get a clarity. - Clarity? I am able to decide. Thanks for your help. I helped you to kill two people? When did this happen? Vicky, have you reached? Two minutes. I will be in position. - Okay. Mahima's car is approaching. A small piece of the bullet is stuck inside. Is another surgery necessary? It is a minor surgery, Mr. Mithran. If you feel any pain don't do anything. I will come and check it personally. Sir, she is stepping out of the car. Keep watching. I will let you know when to shoot. Why did you call me? Tell me. Tell me. I have a clear shot of the target. Hold. Tell me. Can you come home? Can you come for me? Well.. Mr. Prabhakar's kid.. It is his birthday. He had invited us. That's why, I called you. What are you saying? Did you call me for this? Yes. Shall I? Hold on. - Right. You sounded different over the phone. You.. You left in anger, right? Only if I speak like that will you come, right? - Tell me the truth. Did you call me for this? - What else for? Why are you asking me the same thing? If you don't wish to come, it is fine. I thought you had called me to propose to me. Don't you have any sense? Don't you have anything else to think other than love? You somehow come back to the same topic! Listen now. I will never fall in love with you. Please leave me. Why are you behaving like this? Everytime, you cheat me after giving me hopes. You could have, rather, killed me. This life is.. - Abort. What happened? Do what I say. Okay. Lucky you. Why are you killing me bit by bit? Sidharth can hear me. Can't you understand it if I say once? First, go from here! Hey. Your lunch is ready. Cool. How was your day? It's been alright. A bit boring. - Why so? What happened? But I have a feeling it's going to get better. I've fixed an appointment with Shilpa without Sidharth's knowledge. Wait a minute! Keep hugging me and say whatever you want to say! Look here. Stop disturbing me with silly stuffs like your useless meeting with Shilpa. There is no use meeting her. Do you understand? First, cancel the appointment with her. Hereafter, mind your own business! Go. I've informed the doctor, as you said. He'll be here in half an hour. Till then, what's the plan? "When love emerges in my heart.." "Why does my eyes fill with tears?" "I planned to mesmerize you with my eyes." "Like the eyeliner moistened with tears.." "I craved to merge with you." "My heart goes crazy" "when you look at me." "A world of our own" "where we live together." "The look in your eyes conveys your love like a blazing fire." "My heart has gone crazy over the words you conveyed in silence." "The look in your eyes conveys your love like a blazing fire." "My heart has gone crazy over the words you conveyed in silence." "You are the beautiful melody of love. I am the song of your life." "I will live forever in love, even when everything leaves me." "My heart never forgets" "to be in constant remembrance of you." "Your heart never melts." "I shed tears every time." "I shed tears every time." "Even now for our love." "When the gentle breeze flows in.." "When my eyes express the love.." "The nature is amazed" "at your beauty every time." "It rains, it rains." "My heart starts racing!" "My heart goes crazy" "when you look at me." "A world of our own" "where we live together." "The look in your eyes conveys your love like a blazing fire." "My heart has gone crazy over the words you conveyed in silence." "The look in your eyes conveys your love like a blazing fire." "My heart has gone crazy over the words you conveyed in silence." Tell me, Mahi. You don't have to come. I'm a little disturbed. I'm on my way to Pondicherry Ashram. I'll let you know once I'm back. Push. Pull. Push. Pull. Push. Pull. Kumar. I'm not sure if you will find this footage. Even if you find it.. I'm not sure if I'll be alive when you watch it. She shouldn't escape. Finish her the very second you find her. They molested me. This is a report from the Miss India organizers. Wasn't it when you were about to walk the ramp in the final round that they gave you the news about your father's death? The time then was 7:15. But Sidharth planned your father's murder and executed it at 7:45. He did that to disturb you emotionally and make you dependent on him. Ananya was crowned the winner instead. He is making use of her in his business in every possible way. This is the FIR copy and this is the postmortem report. Don't trust him anymore, Shilpa. They are Manimekalai's parents. Greetings. - You'll find all the related documents in this file. - Yeah. Okay. Manimekalai would always think about the research. We never expected things to go so bad for her. Only after meeting him, we've gained some confidence. Look at this atrocity. Tomorrow, at CM's press meet they'll declare that generic medicines won't be approved and that the old agreement will hold good. Check the fax I've sent you. - Yes. I've received the fax. I'll look into it. Shilpa. Replace it with this file. Just do this one favor. Ashok. You accompany dad for the press meet. Inform me as soon as the CM arrives. I'll join you. This is a policy that will benefit us. - Sure. I'll reach there along with your dad and inform you once the CM arrives. Ensure a good press coverage. - Okay. Pramod.. We've had a good breakthrough by following Vicky. Inspector Logu had messaged. He has accepted that he had molested Manimekalai and had sketched out a plan to hook the charges against other innocent fellows. He seems to be inebriated. I called up Logu to find out more details but looks like something is wrong. He is not responding to my calls. They are near Vadapalani, but we don't have the exact location. I've an idea. I'll talk to Perumal Swamy mimicking Sidharth and find out about Vicky's location. I'll inform you as soon as I get the details. Until then, you guys head to Vadapalani with the team. We must arrest Vicky today. Tell us the truth. - Come on, speak up! Tell us the truth. - Won't you open your mouth? Call Vicky. The number you've called is currently not reachable. Call Perumal Swamy. Silent, it's Mr. Sidharth. Hello. - Where are you? At Poral Gardens, sir. Where is Vicky? - He is in Vadapalani. Mithran is out to nab Vicky. Alert him. Okay, sir. - Mithran will call you. He'll mimic me and try to get Vicky's details. Don't get fooled. Who me? Come on, sir. Leave that to me. I'll handle it. Pramod, looks like I don't have to call Perumal Swamy. Vicky isn't in Vadapalani. Using his mobile signal, we have traced his location. He is at his ECR guest house. I'm on my way. You reach there with the team. Call Perumal Swamy. Just like sir said, Mithran has called. Hello. - Is your brother in ECR or Vadapalani? Listen, I'm an expert, you can't cheat me! Perumal, it's me Sidharth! Stop your pranks and mind your business! Call Ashok. Hello. - Ashok. I'm on my way, but I won't attend the press meet. Bring my dad out for a moment. Why are you backing out, all of a sudden? The CM is already here. Dad will take care of everything. I'm sure he can handle it. This is an important press meet. You will find the speech in this file. - Okay. Just read it out. - Okay. I'll do exactly as you said. Head. And forcefully, we shoved drugs into IPS Officer Jana's mouth. We left him on the highway and let him die. Leave me. - Inhale it. Don't you love it? Inhale it! Leave me! Now, go lie down. Now, our respected health minister will present a detailed report on generic medicines. Greetings. Last month, when I was instated as the health minister I promised to transform Tamil Nadu into a disease free state. Did that succeed? So far, it hasn't and I don't see it happening in the future, too. Even now I've been ordered to convey that generic medicines won't be available at low rates. I want to bring out the truth. What's happening? When Ms. Angelina decided to reduce the rates of cancer medicines the businessmen here set up a meeting with the chief minister. They claimed that if those medicines were made available at cheap rates their business would incur a huge loss. Hence, they put forward a request to the CM to stop it from happening. A huge amount was exchanged in the name of this shameful act! They made the minority minister their puppet. Leader. Hold on. - What are you blabbering? Shut up! Why are they getting furious? - Just shut your mouth! My son promised me that he would make me the CM one day. I guess, this is the right time for it. The MD of Pixim had signed an agreement before her death. I have risked my life to get it from the custody of the CM. Where is it? - I don't understand. What is he up to? - Show it here. Sit down! - Who is behind this speech? Sit down or else, we'll finish you. Calm down. Sit down. I guess, next, they will abuse and attack me! They will cross all limits. - Arrange a party meet immediately. Sure, sir. - Immediately. What a trap my son has laid! For having fathered him.. Thank you, Lord! - Sengalvarayan! Come fast. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! What have you done? Can't you control yourself? Vicky, they are on their way. Be careful. Don't tell them anything. Hey, Vicky! Listen to me. Come on, tell us! Get lost! Go! Get out. Are you going to come with me or not? Mahima, it's this gate. Drive fast. - They are here and I'm worried that you'll divulge everything. Don't worry, I'll tell them everything. Is the camera on? We had doped Jana and killed him. But I wasn't the one who ran him over with my car. That was Sidharth! Oh, my God! - Darn it! He was a prime witness! Who could have done this? Hello. - Hello. Why do you keep pestering me? This better be important. Instead of reading out the medical report your dad is speaking ill of the CM. It has caused problems. - What are you saying? The press is covering everything. The party men are furious. - Ask him to fake a heart attack. Okay. - Ashok, admit him to a hospital and update me. I'll be there. The minority.. - Stop it. It seems it wasn't your son who had prepared this speech. Who else had prepared it? There has been some misunderstanding. Ashok, what now? - Don't talk. He asked you to fake an heart attack. Sir, I think, I'm having a heart attack. The heart is on the other side. When did that happen? Get me his speech. - Move. - Call the ambulance. Sir, please tell us.. - Move, call the ambulance. Move aside. He is not well. - Please tell us more, sir. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I'll come back and meet you. Take me to a good hospital. I was the one who asked him to read out this good news but I don't know why he altered the speech and spoke otherwise. Strict actions will be taken against him. The generic medicine agreement will be sanctioned tomorrow. Sir.. - Sir, please answer our questions. This is the report that was read out. Come. Had you been late by a few minutes I would have died of a real heart attack. You wouldn't have seen me alive. You are incorrigible. Now, that's something I don't understand. Dad, you remind me of a story. Which one, dear? Once upon a time, there lived a king. He never trusted his men. So, he had a well-trained monkey for his protection. Round the clock, the monkey was beside the king. One day, while the king was asleep a mosquito was disturbing him. The monkey tried its best. But it couldn't get rid of the mosquito. Finally, the mosquito sat on the king's neck. So, the monkey took a sharp sword and slashed at the mosquito that was sitting on the king's neck. The mosquito died, right? No? Did the mosquito survive the slash? So, it didn't die? There was a call from the CM's office asking your dad to resign within an hour. If he doesn't, they are planning on dismissing him. What is it, Mithran? You said it was urgent. I've received information from an informer that Perumal Swamy's brother was killed by Sidharth Abhimanyu and that he has a video evidence of it. I'll get more evidence against him by tonight. So, I need your support in completing the formalities to arrest him tomorrow. What are you saying? We have to arrest Sidharth Abhimanyu? He is a minister's son. He is a big shot. Do you know that? I guess you haven't received the update yet. The entire ruling party is against him. If you want, you can immediately check it. Are you sure? Sir. ASP Mithran is here with evidence against Sidharth. He has asked to act on it if the evidence are strong. The CM has asked you to meet him with the evidence. Thank you, sir. I'll get prepared for the meeting. My brother! Open your eyes. My brother! - Let it be. - What happened to him? Be calm. We received an anonymous call only a few minutes ago. Call Perumal Swamy. What is going on, Perumal? - Sir. They finished my brother. I told you that Mithran was searching for your brother. Did you pay heed? Now, look what happened. Sir. Give me Mithran's location. I'll finish him. Don't worry, I'll help you do that but before that, you have another job to complete. Tell me, sir. Finish my dad. - Sir? You want me to kill your dad? He has landed himself in trouble and I'm afraid that he might get us into trouble, too. Call me once you finish him. Okay, sir. Sir. Just like you instructed, our driver finished your dad on his way from the hospital. Is he dead? Did you confirm it? It's confirmed, sir. He is burning into ashes as I watch. 22 acres out of 370 acres.. - Yes, sir.. Greetings. - Greetings. Tell me. Are you here to apologize? What is the use now? You should have thought about it earlier. Why did you do this to my dad? - What else did you expect? Did you expect me to be a mute spectator? He made a mockery of all the medical schemes! He insulted the government and called me a thief. This was not my call. It was a decision taken by the party. If I were to make a decision, it would have been even worse. What could be worse than this? You killed him mercilessly! Who me? I killed him? I'll talk to you later. Please go. Send them away. - Did you guys hear that? Didn't he just threaten saying he would have taken a worse action? Didn't you hear him say that? - Please leave. - Don't bring shame to the party. - Go! When did I kill your dad? Tell me the truth. Is he dead? This is ridiculous! You killed him and now, you ask about it! I didn't.. - Just because he spoke ill of you, you killed him. He is no more! Don't believe all these rumors! This is not a rumor. The driver whose vehicle ran him over said that the CM told him to do so. Which driver are you talking about? I'll get him here. Why don't you ask yourself? Why would I kill Sengalvarayan? I took him under me, I made him the MLA and I made him the minister! Believe me. I didn't do this to your dad. You are correct. I killed him! I heard that a warrant is being issued in my name. That one? Since everyone around me persuaded.. You will issue one, is it? I also heard that I'll be asked to step down from the party. Let me see that. Try doing it! 57 MLAs in your minority government are waiting for my orders. What can you do? Warrant? - How do you do this? You killed your father.. You are blaming me for that. For a moment, I.. I.. How do you do it? - I've made it a habit. Didn't you get it? Did you think that I took the blame for your mistake, 20 years ago? Wasn't it so? Didn't I slam him on the table and a glass cut through his throat.. The minute you attacked him, I decided to go to jail. I saw my dad as an MLA. But that fellow was holding on to his life. I could have attained my goal only if he died. I ensured his death. I finished him. I know how to create an opportunity out of nothing and I also know how to pull it back when it slips through my fingers! Now, what do you want me to do? Appoint the person I say in my dad's place. Approve the statement I give regarding generic medicine, as a government policy. No action should be taken against me. If someone comes up with an evidence, bring it to me first. I heard that you spoke ill of my dad. Is it true? Take it back and with a 21-gun salute pay your last respects. I'll let you know if I need anything else. People have elected me because they believe that I do good deeds for them. How can I cheat them? Even God can't do good deeds all the time. "I'm evil.." Who are we when compared to Him? Rally, steady, go! Posse, fire! My deepest condolences to you. Every sensation has its end point. Positions! You are under arrest. When I met you 20 years ago, I was shocked wondering what you would do to this country. Now, after 20 years I am amazed to see him. Master of masters will arise someday. You began your life in a beacon vehicle. Now, there is another beacon vehicle waiting for you to write your destiny. Go. Are you even aware of what you are doing? Your questions will be answered by him. Our country tops the list of diabetic patients in the world. A medicinal plant known as sea weed is available in plenty, in our oceans. Medicines for diabetes can be produced from them at a lesser price. It can even cure the disease permanently in six months. Believe me. We have discovered this. It's my effort. I discovered this medicine. Sidharth is trying to make money by selling it abroad. If that happens we may not get that medicine for the next ten years. In the greed to prepare this medicine soon he fed medicines made without proper research to 18 children and killed them brutally. I'll get killed in sometime. But.. But this evidence will be worth all the sacrifice. Honorable Court. This is a rare sea weed found in abundance in our oceans. If the foreign countries get a patent on this our country might have to depend on them. Honorable Court. Mr. Sidharth killed Ms. Angelina and acquired her company in Switzerland. Through this company, he tried selling the medicine's formula worldwide which he stole from Manimekalai. Evidence for this has been produced before the court. Here is Vicky's statement who had helped the accused. And forcefully shoved drugs into IPS Officer Jana's mouth. We let him wander on the highway. We were responsible for his death. Ashok Pandian, Charles Chelladurai, Perumal Swamy.. Having them as proxies he corrupted Tamil Nadu in the name of medical mafia and natural resources. Here are the reports. It includes their personal phone calls and documents. Yes, sir. We checked the reports. Whatever he said is right. - Mr. Sidharth. By tomorrow, if you don't give an answer it will imply that you've accepted all the accusations made against you. The court orders to imprison Sidharth Abimanyu in the sub-jail for today. Mr. Mithran, take charge. You have arrested him. Let us kill him in an encounter. Only if we shoot him brutally will our anger subside. We have even decided the place for the encounter. Tomorrow, when you take him to the court instead of passing via Anna Nagar take a diversion and pass via Thirumangalam. We will take care of the rest. Sir. - Sir. Let's avoid the mic, bug, and these technologies and have a private conversation. What say? You acted well without the bug. Now, you want to act as if there is no mic? Pramod. - Yes, sir. We will wait outside. Come. Sidharth. Shall we strike a deal? Deal? I like deals. How much do you want? 100 crores? 200? - Forget 100 crores. Even if you want to give me 100 bucks, I'll have to approve it. Your national and international funds have been freezed. As we speak your business, real estate, and mafia are being shut down. We have arrested all those who are involved. Even the business that you wished to begin on sugar medicine.. Patent rights have been reserved in Manimekalai's name. Now, those medicines will be available in our country. Patent rights in Manimekalai's name? She doesn't even know the formula. Just because she blabbered something you will change the patent, is it? I discovered it with a lot of effort so that the world would recognize me. I know that. - You know that? She did not blabber anything. I made her blabber. It was first discovered by Sidharth. He is trying to make money by selling it to foreign countries. I fought with him saying that I cannot allow this. He replied saying. This is my hard work. I discovered this medicine. So, he says, it is his wish to make money out of it. I edited 'it is his wish' to 'it is my wish'. She mentioned, it was your discovery but I edited it and proved that it was her discovery. Played smartly. I learnt it from you. You have committed organized crimes behind several emotional crimes. I only needed one emotional crime to put an end to your organized crimes. To punish you for all your crimes, I needed one crime that you hadn't committed. Do you wish to see the response that it earned? He is making a living out of her discovery. He should be killed. If I get a chance to confront him, I will beat him up. He should be beaten up. He calls himself a scientist. He doesn't deserve the Padmashree title. First, seize that title. And hang him to death. He sat next to me during the function. I smiled at him. But I cannot be responsible if you associate me with him. I haven't met him before and I don't have any connection with him. Please don't ask me about him. In the name of organized crime if I'd have said that you have killed many people mysteriously and that you ruined many lives they would have ignored it and told me to mind my business. But now, in front of the same crowd I've labelled you as a thief within a day. That too, the label of a knowledgeable thief. All the ministers who claimed that they don't know you have arranged goons to kill you the moment you walk out of here, the only reason being they know you. Now, it's a big deal for you to reach the court. You never know how and who will shoot you. Suppose you reach the court despite all this I will make sure, you are sentenced to life imprisonment. I hope you have understood now. You have nowhere to go. Shall we discuss the deal now? I was thinking of killing him even if it costs me my life. Mahima told me to kill him without losing my life. But now, I say. I should live and so should he. - He should live? I can't believe, you just said that. We lost Jana. The one whom I destroy should result in the destruction of 100 criminals. I chose Sidharth for that purpose. But if he lives and speaks the truth thousands of criminals will be dead. He is associated with many national and international criminals. That's what we want. To fulfil this purpose Jana lost his life. Just because he lost his life and in the name of revenge if I change my goal it would be equivalent to dishonoring his sacrifice. All these days, you believed me blindly. Please believe me that I would do the right thing even now. This is the bulletproof vest that is going to save your life. The deal is simple. I give back your life and freedom. All the criminals who are fearless of the Indian police department are afraid of you. All their secrets are in your hands. I need them. Wear this bulletproof vest. When we go out, the police department's best shooter will shoot you. But nothing will happen to you. Let people who are waiting to kill you think that you are dead. With the support of the government I take the responsibility of keeping you safe under the Witness Protection Program. In order to bring forward all the VIPs cheating the country I give you this offer to help me. You know you cannot escape. But if you think you can look there. I came to know through Perumal Swamy that you had planned to kill your father. Sir. As you said, our driver killed your dad on his way from the hospital. Is he dead? Did you confirm it? - Sir, it is confirmed. The ashes for which you paid respects with the 21-gun salute.. Do you know whose ashes those were? It was my friend Jana's, whom you had killed brutally. Everybody present there knew that it was Jana's ashes. Except for you. Give me.. Give me five minutes. I hope you'll take the right decision. Are you fine, Pazhani? You've forced me to bring the cops along to safeguard myself from you. By killing everyone and by being alone, what are you planning to achieve? Being with people is happiness. If you aren't aware of that truth, what is the purpose of wisdom? Pazhani. I did everything as you said. This one time.. This one time, please listen to me. Wear this vest. Please don't think too much. He is a murderer! - Hang him to death! Hang him to death! - Hang him to death! Ministers, businessmen and the other VIPs.. Come. "I don't care who it is, nor do I care if you are the Lord of Death." Good choice, Sidharth. "Even if I live.." - Suraj. - Tell me, Mithran. Everything as per plan. Take position. - Okay. "I don't care for the money, nor do I care for the corpse." "For my survival, I'll sacrifice anyone!" Put him inside the van. Can this vest take the sniper? Definitely, it will. This is type 3 A. It has been reinforced with ceramic and metal. Specially for sniper. I see. Arrest him. Sidharth! Down! Down! Down! Down! - Move. Fast. Sidharth Abhimanyu! - Down! Down! Kill him! - Don't spare him! Sidharth! - Down! Down! "Better think, better go." "A human wandering in the form of an animal, that's me." "Better think, better go. A human wandering.." Do you see the line marked near the man standing there? That's your mark. "Do not allow anyone at the entrance." Suraj. Target approaching mark. Take aim. I am at the vantage point. Ready. Sidharth! Move! No. Suraj. Suraj.. No! Why didn't you wear the bulletproof vest? I don't need it. You'll need it. How many times do I have to say? Sidharth! Sidharth! Sidharth! Ambulance! Call the ambulance. Sidharth, stay with me. When a lover shoots you die in the arms of your enemy. It's a common phrase, right? Come. Why are you worried? Are you worried because I am dying or is it because I did not provide you with the evidence? This is not the time. Come. Get up. I gave the evidence you asked for. I gave it to you. Tell me how. Let's discuss this later. - Think over it. Think.. I don't have much time. I don't need it. You'll need it. Bulletproof vest. I did not accept the life you gave. Instead, I gave you the life you asked for. Not for the country. Only because you asked for it. For you. "I don't care if it's injustice, nor do I care for the injuries.." "Whatever it is, I'll turn them in my favor!" "After I win this world, I'll walk up to the top." "I'll set up my reign in a grand manner!" - Sidharth! There is anxiety in the air as there are record arrests happening everywhere. Enough evidences have been received against the corrupt businessmen and ministers. This involves Sidharth Abhimanyu's underground business deals. By threatening several VIPs he had manipulated the agreements in his favor and the evidence proves it. Beyond all this excitement there is another excitement within me. The memories are still fresh about the news I had read for the first time. That of the police arresting a 15 year old boy. Why so? For what? I thought about it. That news made by him at that moment was the news that gave shape to my thinking. In the midst of this garbage do I hold my nose and pretend that it isn't stinky? Or am I going to take my hands off my nose and admit that it stinks and clean my surroundings? A question I raised back then for which my present life is the answer. "If a lone man decides" "there are no obstacles that can stop him." "If a lone man decides" "the world will make way for him." "When wrongdoing arises, I'll stop it." "I'll conquer the flames of evil, everyday." "I'm a lone man." "I'm a lone man." "I'm a lone man." "Crack the whip to clean up the country." "Lead the youth to glory." "I shall rise against evil" "a one-man army against you." "One day, this world shall come to an end, buddy." "I shall destroy you before that world arrives!" "If a lone man decides" "there will be no obstacles that can stop him." "If a lone man decides" "this world will make way for him." "Whenever a wrongdoing arises" "I'll stop it." "I'll conquer" "the flames of evil, everyday." "I'm a lone man." "I'm a lone man." "Overcome fear, embrace manliness." "Destroy evil, defeat your enemy." "Overcome fear, embrace manliness." "Destroy evil, defeat your enemy." "Overcome fear, embrace manliness." "Destroy evil, defeat your enemy." "Overcome fear, embrace manliness." "Destroy evil, defeat your enemy." "Overcome fear." "Defeat your enemy." "Overcome fear." "Overcome fear, defeat your enemy." "Overcome fear."
