Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. I cut the power. We've got about ten seconds before that alarm brings an entire team down here. Here. - We need to go. - Okay, go. Go. Okay, come on. I love you. You tell me now? I love you. Go! No!No!No! Let go. You have to go now. - No. I won't leave you. - Let go. - No. - I promise I'll find you. You have to go. Go! Go! You have another nightmare? Yeah. Baby, what are we going to do with you? I don't know. Do you want to talk about it? There's nothing to talk about. Same dream? Same dream. Same time. I'm trapped, being chased. Can't get away. And then I wake. And that's it? It's just you, nobody else? No. Just me. Is it me? Is what you? I don't know. You're alone. You can't get away. Is it us? - Do I make you feel trapped? - No. Babe, I know this isn't exactly what we had in mind when we were younger, but... This castle? Who gets everything they fantasize about, right? I got you. Come here. It's just a dream. That's all it is. Okay? Well, we're going to have to get you some better dreams. That would be nice. Oh, come on. - Shit. - What is it? Another bombing in the U.F.B. Passenger train. Goddamn Resistance. I'm going to have to catch the 6:30 departure. They're calling all emergency personnel to go up top. I got to go. We'll pick this up tonight, okay? Try and get a little sleep. Sleep scares me. Well, dream of me. Okay. But not in these pants. The bomb went off just moments after the commuters boarded. We are being told rescue teams are still searching for survivors. The death toll is at 144 and still rising. This marks the fourth attack in United Federation of Britain in as many months. And all signs point to terrorist leader Matthias and his Resistance movement. The U.F.B. exploits us. The workers of The Colony deserve equality. The Fall enslaves us all. Chancellor Cohaagen pointed to this as proof that Matthias does not seek a peaceful path to independence for The Colony, but rather a prolonged and bloody conflict. And with overpopulation figures in the U.F.B. continuing to rise, this could not come at a worse time. You'll recall the last attack occurred six weeks ago. Federal police have since attributed that bombing to this man, Carl Hauser, a former intelligence officer turned traitor now considered to be Matthias' right-hand man. No word yet as to whether Hauser had a role in this morning's incident. Going somewhere? No? Well, don't let that stop you. That fantasy that remains forever out of reach? Not anymore. At Rekall, we'll provide you with a complete set of memories all your own. Rekall. We can remember it for you. All passengers, please report to your designated gates. This is the final boarding call for the 7:15 departure. Wake up to the truth! Cohaagen is counting on your complacency. Don't let them ship you across the Earth like cattle. Come on, move. Matthias speaks the truth! The Fall enslaves us all! - Hey, buddy. You look like shit, man. - All section A departures are located... - Thanks. - No offense. I feel like shit. None taken. I ain't sleeping so well, man. Yeah, these new shifts are kicking my ass, too. At least the extra pay lets the missus rest easier. Look at you. Mr. Glass-is-half-full at 6:00 a.m. Hola. Privyet. Welcome to The Fall. 7:21 a.m. Travel time to United Federation of Britain: 17 minutes. Dropping in 60 seconds. Has it ever occurred to you that we always sit in these exact same seats? For years now... Why? I don't know. They're seats. We have asses. Seems like the logical thing to do. I'm talking about us following the same routine, all right, day after day, year after year without even questioning it. Want to switch it up? No sweat. Please make sure all personal belongings are stored below your seat before departure. Oh, yeah. Much more happening on this side. Good call. - Dick. - The Fall dropping in four, three, two, one. Have a nice day. Despite recent talks between Chancellor Cohaagen and The Colony's governor, the Chancellor has announced that he will be stopping all humanitarian aid to The Colony in light of this morning's bombing. As much as I want to focus our efforts on cleaning up The Colony, today's terrorist attacks means that funding will have to go to bolstering our synthetic federal police force. The protection of our citizens will always come first. Approaching core. Please prepare for gravity reversal. Security elevated to level three. Please remain in scanners until cleared. Looks like that bomb set off a hell of a panic up here. Identification documents must be in hand and ready to present to the security officer before entering the screening area. All factory personnel must enter through security gate 12. Hey, what do you know about Rekall? - That mind-altering shit? - Yeah. Do yourself a favor, Doug, stay away from them. Why is that? Remember Travis from shift three? - Travis. - Went to Rekall for his bachelor party. Wanted to be king of Mars or some shit. I'd like to go to Mars. Got himself lobotomized. Any available biometric tech, please report to the... - You believe those stories? -...central office... - About Rekall? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. Come on. You never thought about it, just a little bit? I don't need to think about it. Don't mess with your mind, man. It ain't worth it. All right, all right, listen up. Maybe I need my mind messed with. We're starting double shifts again. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey- - Don't blame me. - Fuck me. I don't want to be here any longer than you do, okay? They've increased the production of police synthetics thanks to that shit this morning, so... So take all your complaints to Chancellor Cohaagen. Now, which one of you fine, upstanding assholes wants to train the new guy? Come on. Hey. Come on. Don't look at me. I trained the last guy you fired. - Quaid. - Yeah. You're up. - Great. Thank you. - Any time. Synthetics coming down! Section three weld scanners are temporarily offline. Don't hold it like that. Hold it here. If you hold it there and the synth shorts, one of those bolts will shoot straight through your hand. No Shit, huh? No shit. Easier ways to get a day off. Thanks. Hey, you know, your friend was wrong, by the way. About Rekall. What, you've done it? Been three times already. Really? Best memories I have. A whole lot better than this shit. Hey. Ask for Mac. Okay? You're going to thank me. Level nine, please report to Human Resources. Strap yourself in. This guy's a laugh-a-minute. Next. Here you are. Please, have a seat. You work on the production line. In activation, yeah. I understand you live in The Colony. Yeah, I make the commute like everyone else. Sorry, who are you? If you don't mind my asking. - I'm with the Cohaagen administration. - I see. Given these politically charged times, there is a heightened concern regarding the, shall we say, loyalty of our workers. - Yeah, but I don't work for you. - But you do. This company was granted the government contract for police synths, and we are, the last time I checked, the government. Okay, I see. So you brought me in here because of where I live. We're bringing in all the employees. Oh, really? Who's questioning the suits? Who gets to question you? Mr. Quaid, in your capacity here, you are privy to police synth technology that is currently classified. I know how to turn 'em on, if that's what you mean. We'd like you to sign this. And what is that? It affirms that you will not divulge proprietary technology to any source, either foreign or domestic. And that you are not actively engaged in any attempt to overthrow this administration. You want me to sign something that says I'm not a terrorist? The document merely affirms you are who you say you are. And if I were a terrorist, you think this would make me tell you? - Is that your guy's big plan? - Mr. Quaid... You catch anyone yet? I have 75 more of these interviews today. Yeah, you know what, pal? I had a long day, too. Well, if you'd like to have another, you'll shut up and do what you're told. Wow. Second page at the bottom. You like your job? I'm a people person. Thank you. Next. Gates nine through 18 now closed. Section A departures will reopen in 40... All right, finally. - Cheers. Salud. - Yeah. Jesus. Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Glad you called. Needed a drink. Lori working tonight? Yeah. Hey, Murray. Same. You ever learn how to play the piano? Yeah, I always wanted to learn to play the piano. What's with you today? What? Yeah, exactly. You've been zoned out all day. I've been having these dreams. Dreams? Yeah, feels like I'm doing something... Something... Something that matters, something important, you know? Nope, not so much. You don't think what we do is important? Really? Come on, Harry. We commute halfway around the world for shit jobs, for shit pay, to come to this shit bar and get drunk on too much shit beer. - No offense, Murray. - Yeah. What? Are you actually happy with how your life's turned out? - Why the hell shouldn't I be? - Are you serious? Is there something wrong with it? No. You know what? You're right. Forget it. I'm just... Forget it. Who's the girl? What do you mean? You heard me. Who's the girl? There's no girl. It's just me. Good. 'Cause women like Lori don't just fall out of the sky. You're a lucky man. You're living the dream, my friend. - Really? - Yeah, man. - I'm living the dream? - Yeah. All right, big guy. Tomorrow. Hey. My advice? Go ahead. Figure out a way to deal with whatever the hell it is you're going through before you mess your shit up for good. It's possible I might have drank too much. Yeah, it's possible, Harry. I'm going to go throw up on something now. - Okay. - And you're going to get your shit together and go home to your wife, you hear me? Yeah, I think everyone heard you, Harry. Night, Dougie. Good night. Seem like you're looking for something. Is it this? Anything goes here. Trust me, baby, you're gonna wish you had three hands. I'm looking for Rekall. You know where I can find it? Stairway to heaven, over there. Sure I can't change your mind? I'm a lot more interactive. I bet. Thank you. Welcome to Rekall. First time? Yeah. That obvious, huh? It's fine. There's nothing to be afraid of. This is a safe place. My friend Marek gave me this card, told me to ask for Mac. - He's right inside. - Thanks. Remember to have a good time. Welcome. Hey. You're a friend of Marek's. Yes. Yeah, we work together. Is that it? That is it. And it feels like real life? What is life but our brain's chemical perception of it? Your eyes see, your brain chemistry reacts. Here, we just remove the middleman and we go straight to the chemistry. Does that make it any less real? An illusion, no matter how convincing, is still just an illusion. That's very good. You're right, objectively. But from the inside, subjectively... I assure you, it's quite the opposite entirely. Listen, I get it. I get it. You're here because you feel like something's missing. You got some tug, some longing for something more. We're going to give you that thing. Is that right? Could be something you could never afford to do. Something secret you've always wanted to try, but you would never, ever dare. What do you mean, secret? Anything. Tell us your fantasy. We'll give you the memory. You want to be rich and famous? Worshiped by millions? Maybe something with a little more adrenaline, huh? Crime fighter? Or world-class athlete? Secret agent. That's you. Right? Clandestine bank accounts, -coded messages. - Secret agent. I could do that. Yeah, as an intelligence operative. You could be working for the Resistance. Maybe you work for Cohaagen. Or why limit yourself? Why not both? One last thing, Doug. As a matter of full disclosure, none of the secret life elements you chose can actually be true. See, the thing is, a lot of guys come in here, they want the secret mistress trip when they already have one, a real one, on the side. We can't do that. It would cause irreparable conflict and confusion. That's how brains get blown. Don't worry, I don't have any secrets. I'm sure you don't, but just in case, we're going to run a psycho-polygraphic panel on you anyway. Marcus, go. You're going to have such a good time, you're not going to want to come back. Look at that. Looks like your wife does have a man who appreciates her. No conflict there. Sorry. Still the best way to get chemicals into the human body. All right. Let's get this show on the road. Get ready to save the world. Happy trails, man. You can tell me all about it when you get... Wait. What? Shit. Shit? What is it? What's wrong? Yank that needle out before it takes. What is it? What's wrong? - You lied. - Lied about what? - Son of a bitch. - Look, I don't have a mistress. - What are you talking about? - Mistress? You're a goddamn spy. Vitals are everywhere. Why are you here? Why? Federal police! - Federal police! On your feet now! - No, wait! This is all a mistake! It's all... I'm nobody. - I'm nobody. - Hands on your head now! Okay. Turn around! Okay. Holy shit. 118.5, code six. 105 north... Go! Move, move, move! Federal police! Team one, have you secured the suspect? Team one, advise. Let me know what's going on in there. Stevens, get an eyeball in there now. Shit. They're all down. He's all alone! Let's punch it. Fall back! Fall back! Cover the exit! In what is being described as a terrorist attack, a solitary gunman opened fire on a squadron of federal police at the Rekall Lounge in downtown Fremont. We are still awaiting word -on precisely how many casualties there are. - Yes. - But officials now confirming... - Okay. ...that at least 20 officers have been killed... Oh, my God, Doug. I understand. Yeah. - Thank you. - Lon. - I'm so glad you're here. - Of course I'm here. I've been going out of my mind. Where have you been? Look, something bad has happened. No, I know. I just got the call. We've all been put on standby. You don't understand. What? Oh, my God. Doug, are you okay? Lori, it wasn't the Resistance who killed those sentries. It wasn't terrorists. It was me. What was you? Lori, I'm the one who killed them. You killed 20 armed men? No. No, it was more like ten. But you killed them? With what, honey, your book? - Lori, look, I'm serious. - Doug, you're scaring me! I'm sorry. This is going to sound crazy, okay? I went to Rekall after work. - And. .. - What? - What did they do to you? - Nothing. Nothing. I sat in the chair, they hooked me up. Before they could do anything, the police burst in. They tried to take me. And I just reacted. And I killed them. Listen, you didn't kill anyone, Doug. Trust me, I killed everyone. No, sweetheart, don't you see? Whatever you think you did had nothing to do with any of this. Those assholes screwed with your mind, and now you're having some kind of a paranoid delusion. Those places are really dangerous. Whatever it is that happened, we're going to get through it. Come here. Come on. Come on. It happened so fast. It's okay, we'll figure it out. I'm sorry. Lori, I can't breathe. Come on. What the hell are you doing? Lori, what the fuck... Lori, what the... Lori, goddamn it, what are you doing? My Job. Are you crazy? Am I crazy? That's a good one, Doug. Considering you don't even know who the hell you are. Do you really believe a factory worker could take out an entire room of highly-trained men? Tell me what is going on. Talk! Or we can skip straight to "Until death do us part." I'm not your wife. That's bullshit. We've been married seven years. I'm U.F.B. police intel, assigned to play your wife. Six weeks ago, I didn't even know you. What are you talking about? It's true. Your memory was replaced. Your mind was implanted with a life you think you've lived. You keeping up, baby? There is no Douglas Quaid, there never was. Are you saying I don't... This... Every... Our marriage... What can I say? I give good wife. Come on. Deep down, did you really believe someone like me would marry someone like you, live in this shithole? If I'm not me, then who the hell am I? How would I know? I just work here. Speculate. If I had to guess, all the trouble Cohaagen's taken to hide you from the Resistance, you must be fairly important. And with your skill set, I think it's highly doubtful you're his gardener. Cohaa... Cohaagen's trying to hide me? Why are you trying to kill me? Talk! Call it seven-year itch, Doug. And by the way, you haven't even begun to see me try to kill you! No! Shit. Team three, break position. I need you on-site now. Glide two seven, understood. Shit. Move! Shit. I want his phone back on the grid now. Hey! Move! Hello? Hello. It's Hammond. I don't know any Hammond. Oh, shit. You said this might happen. Look, find a piece of glass. Put your hand to it. Do it now. Oh, Jesus. They really did a number on you, didn't they? Who the hell are you? You honestly don't remember any of it, do you? No. No, I don't. Remember what? How do you know me? We worked at federal intel together. Look, there isn't much time. You said to me that if you ever pop back on the grid, I was to phone this number. The grid? Your phone. It's been reactivated. How do you think they've been tracking you? Look, you asked me to give you a message, so I'm giving it to you. Get the key. The key? What is the key? You said you'd know. Yeah, well, I don't! So tell me what it is. Look, I know we were close, but this is getting too dangerous. If they find out I've contacted you, I'll be... Just... Just tell me what's going on. All right, who is it you think I am? Henry. Henry, okay, good. Henry, who? Look, there isn't any time. If I were you, I'd get rid of that phone. - All right? Now. - How can I get rid of the phone? It's in my goddamn hand. How am I... Hey, wait. 10549. 10549. Come on. Holy shit. What is that? Where can I get one? - What the hell? - Yo, come on. Hey, Robo-dick, that's mine! Going somewhere? No? Well, don't let that stop you. That fantasy that remains forever out of reach? Not anymore. At Rekall, we'll provide you with a complete set of memories all your own. Rekall. We can remember it for you. Come inside! We have hot food for you. Quaid must've known we'd be tracking it. How the hell would he have known that? Oh, shit. He made you look like a fool. He'd had major tactical training, sir. I wasn't made aware of that. How the hell did he get activated? An agent in place told me he'd gone to Rekall. I sent a team in, but his memory implant had been blown before they could get to him. I'm 15 minutes behind him. Neutralize only, do you understand me? No lethal force. I want him alive for re-implantation. Who the hell is this guy, sir? Take me off display. Line is secure. Are you fucking kidding me? Why is he still alive? Yes, sir. - We kill him on sight. - But the Chancellor said... I'm sorry, say again. - Sorry. - The Chancellor's not here on the ground. Believe me, if that target's given even half a chance, he will end us. If you see him, you shoot to kill. - Is that understood? - Will you lay off, asshole? I keep telling you, that's my phone. The guy gave it to me, I swear. Where was he going? Who? The man that gave it to you. Lady, do I look like a psychic? How the hell do I know? All I'm saying is that phone is my personal property now, okay? I know my rights, so you all can just... Hey! When you've got your breath back, you're going to tell me everything that man said to you, starting from the beginning. Who are you? I'm his wife. Okay. You're good. Can I help you, sir? Yeah, I have a safety-deposit box here. It's 10549. Okay. This way, please. Just need a signature match. - Signature match? - For the account. Is there a problem, Mr. Reed? No. No problem. You can use any one of these client rooms. And I'll just be outside, if you need me. Thanks. Okay. They're gonna be coming for me any second, so I need to make this quick. Okay, you're going to find this hard to believe, but this is not your face. I've been captured and resculpted into this, this person you think you are now. If you're watching this, it means I failed to escape. It means, it means they succeeded in giving you a new name, a new identity and a new set of memories... Everything, everything. Anything you think you know about your life, it's not real. You have to believe me. The most important thing for you to do now, is get to my apartment! Get to my apartment! 549 Hysperion, Block D. I want to tell you more, but I can't trust you yet. My only hope is, if you are me, you found the key and you know what to do with it. You found the key and you know what to do with it! What key? What key? - What key? - Good luck. - Good luck, buddy. - What... Come on, come on. Come on. Passengers may proceed to security screening. Please have your identification documents ready. Hold it! Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step through the scanner again, please. How long are you here? Two weeks. Are you a citizen of The Colony? Yes. How long is your stay? Three days. What is your business in the U.F.B.? Thank you. Excuse me? Three days. Yes. Thank you. - That's him! - What the... Everybody down! Eastside exit! Go, go, go! We have a visual! - Coming through! - Go, go! We've alerted all units outside. How the hell did he get a weapon past the scanner? He didn't. Perfect. Move, move, move, move! Clear, clear! Move! - Alert 6246. - Hey! All units, take position. - He's headed up to I-19. - Copy that. Move it! Oh, God! Oh, God. Get in! Now! I can't believe it's you. You recognize me? I don't know. Wait. Do you know who I am? I have been looking for you everywhere. Suddenly, you show up on all the police scanners. Oh, shit. Hold on. You really don't remember me? No. I've seen you before, but it's... It's okay. It's okay. I can explain everything. Central 99, air support has visual on the suspect traveling north on Interstate 19. Oh, shit. Lori. Who? It's my wife. You're married? It's safe to say we're separated. Here, you drive! Suspect is headed to suspension level three. Repeat, he has headed to suspension three. AV-81, he's headed eastbound on Wellington. I want you there before he is, do you copy? Copy that, 905. All vehicle and air support, proceed to Wellington. Establish a barricade in zone 217. Central, I want all units to maintain their perimeter. Drive him into that barricade. Do not allow him any room for evasion. Is that clear? Copy that, 905. All vehicles, hold position. Oh, shit. Shit. Warning, mag suspension cannot be disengaged while vehicle is in operation. What the hell are you doing? You're gonna need your seat belt on! Warning, mag suspension cannot be disengaged while vehicle is in... They've got a lock on the vehicle. Are they clear to engage? You are clear to engage. - Got it? - No,no! - You got it? - Yes! Shit! Welcome. Operating systems activated. Welcome home Mr. Reed. Did you have a nice day? Great, thanks. The key, the key, the key. This message is being recorded in the event of a worst-case scenario. I'm sure you're desperate for answers, so I 'll just start from the top. My name... Your name is Carl Hauser. Oh, shit. This recording has limited interactive capabilities. So, just try rephrasing the question. You work with Matthias. Yes and no. I've never actually met the man. Hardly anyone has. Look, I know that this is complicated. - Complicated? - But this is the truth. I am a Federal Intelligence operative assigned by Cohaagen to infiltrate the Resistance and assassinate Matthias. But instead, I discovered I was fighting for the wrong side. I met a woman She works with the Resistance. And she showed me that they were worth fighting for. You mean the terrorists. Listen, the Resistance are not terrorists. All right. Matthias' targets are always military installations. If there's anything else happening, you can be sure it's Cohaagen himself. Trust me, all right. The Chancellor and I go way back. He was my commanding officer in the war. I know exactly what he is capable of. Why would he attack his own people? I don't understand. How else could he justify tripling production of federal police synthetics? He is building a private army capable of invading The Colony. Think about it. All right. What is the one resource The Colony has that United Britain doesn't? - Space. - Exactly. He's run out of room. But even Cohaagen himself is gonna have a difficult time selling the forced seizure and mass displacement of billions. So, he created an enemy in Matthias, and he built an army to fight him. And now it is up to me to stop him. Up to you to stop him. What do you mean, me? The synthetics run on a bio-mech brainstem. All right. Which means, it's possible to shut 'em all down. All right, there's a kill code. It's a complex sequence, but it's in my head, it's in your head. Sorry, come again. I went back to U.F.B. territory to try and retrieve the code, knowing full well that if Cohaagen found out I'd turned, he'd erase my memory. But what he didn't know was that I arranged to have a black box imbedded in my brain, in your brain. It recorded everything I saw. So, you're saying there's a little safe in my skull. Yes. And that is why I need you. The world needs you, to reconnect with the Resistance. Deliver the code to Matthias, have him shut down the synthetics and stop Cohaagen while there's still time. The future hangs on what you... On what we do next. Good luck, buddy. You have got to be kidding me. This can't be happening. Shouldn't have come here. Yeah, I know. I had no choice. I know that this is a lot to take. Yeah, it's a lot to take. Yeah, I'm supposed to believe this? It's the truth. Hauser, we have been looking for you. Don't call me... My name is Doug Quaid. I was born August 29th. All right, I was raised by my mother. She died of cancer ten days before my 15th birthday. I married my girlfriend when I was 29! You were born April 29th. You were raised by your father, not your mother. He died before you were 15, but in a car crash. And believe me, you were most definitely not married. I'm sorry. You know what? None of this makes any sense to me. I'm Doug Quaid, that's all I know. You recognized me. From a dream. I recognize you from a dream. It wasn't a dream. It was a memory. That scar on your hand, how do you think you got it? Do you know? I got it at work. I was trying to help you escape, but I was too late. You grabbed onto me and a bullet tore through your hand and mine. You must remember something. And you and I, we were... Yeah. We got to go. We got to go. Shit. Come on, come on. Doug! Harry? Harry, what are you doing here? They sent me in for you. To talk you down. Who sent you in? Doug, you don't get it. I don't mean they sent me in here. I mean, they sent me into your mind. I need you to listen to me. You're suffering what's called a paranoid dissociative break. Brought on by the trauma of a chemical fantasy. What are you talking about? You're not really here, Doug. You're still back at Rekall, strapped to a chair. None of this is real. Back at Rekall? He's lying. He's lying! Just slow down. Harry, what are you talking about? When we were back at the bar, you had me worried. So, I followed you. And by the time I got here, it was too late. You were unresponsive. So they chemically transfused me into your mind. They thought a familiar face might help, to try and bring you back before it's too late and you're trapped here forever. Do not listen to them. They're just trying to recover what's in your head. Doug, I assure you. This is not the Harry that you know. Think... Does he even sound like himself? He is a plant, just like your wife, to keep you in line. I don't sound like me, Doug, because you don't want me to. What do you mean, "I don't want you to"? You need to realize, I'm merely the idea of Harry. The rest is supplied by your own imagination. Even the explanation I'm giving you right now. It's really you. It's really you. Your mind is choosing the words. Because that's where we are, Doug. In your mind. We must get you out before it's too late, and you're trapped here forever. If this is all in my mind, why are you wearing a bulletproof vest? Because you put it on me. - I put it on you? - Don't you see? Explain that to me, how do I put this on you? He's crazy. Part of you wants to protect me. To let me guide you back to consciousness before your psychosis reaches such extreme levels that you slip into a permanent coma. To convince you to free yourself. Hauser... I am real. He is real. He works for Cohaagen. Lori? - What's she doing here? - She's here, too, Doug. What's she doing here? She's in the room, beside you, holding your hand right now, worried sick. It's her presence you're sensing. She's... She's trying to kill me! - No. - Harry! Not the real Lori, Doug. As soon as I told her what was happening at Rekall, she came straight over. I had to call her at work. She loves you, Doug. Lori didn't work last night, Harry. You're lying. You're lying. Why are you lying to me? Only because you wanted me to. You're clinging to the delusion. He's lying! Harry? Harry. I swear to God, put it down. Harry, what are you doing? Harry, what are you doing? This is not a delusion! No? Okay, fine. Tell you what. Is that proof enough for you? Would I have done that if this were for real? You see, I'm not afraid, Doug. You shouldn't be either. That's enough of this bullshit. Now, you are gonna tell him the truth, or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you. Don't... Don't. Hauser... He's trying to manipulate you into giving yourself up! - We got to get out of here. - And go where? There's no getting out of your own head, Doug. But you can escape this nightmare if you let me help you. Help me how? - Don't listen to him. - How can you help me? Don't listen to him. You have to shoot her, Doug. What, now? I know that's asking a lot, but she's at the epicenter of this whole twisted fantasy of yours. She represents all your frustration, all your unhappiness. - Hauser... - Which is why it would mean nothing if we were to kill her. It's you who has to choose reality. You shoot her, Doug, and I promise you, you will gasp awake and find me sitting in the room beside you. The real me. - No. - Your old pal, Harry. Look at me. Turn, and you'll see your beautiful, loving wife. She wants you back, Doug. We both do. That's right, Doug. Come on back. Come on back, Doug. I can't let them take you away. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Of course she can't do it. She's not real. Now you just need to prove it to yourself. End her, Doug. End this nightmare. Shoot her! Kill her, damn it! Shoot! Jesus Christ. God damn it, Harry! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Come on. You still out there, baby? Or I suppose I should be calling you Hauser. I guess the joke's on me. I really thought you were a loser. Turns out, I was living with the greatest intelligence agent alive. Cohaagen still wants you back, you know. Guess he still has faith in you. But then you always were the favorite. But I know what you are. You're a traitor, Hauser. And traitors get put to death! Come on, come on, come on. So you might want to give your little girlfriend a kiss good-bye. Long as she doesn't mind where those lips have been. Oh, that's it, I'm ending this bitch. Shit, I'm out. Come on! Come on! Go! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on. Shit. Go! There. Oh, shit. Come on. Give me the gun. Track him. Grab my arm! Is this going down? No? Level D-14. Shit. Come on. Come on. Wait, wait. Go! You really know how to pick 'em. Come on. Sources close to the Chancellor will neither confirm nor deny... Passage on The Fall requires a current transit visa. If you do not have a current transit visa, please visit the information office. The largest real estate agency has now opened. Be sure to visit... The Resistance leader has been in hiding for over six months. In the wake of these latest attacks, federal police have uncovered alarming new evidence proving what many in the Cohaagen administration have long suspected, that Matthias and his terrorist movement are being funded by The Colony's governor and his district's organization. And we're now hearing unconfirmed reports of military mobilization. Sources close to the Chancellor will neither -confirm nor deny the reports. - Jesus. The Resistance leader has been... We've got to get you to Matthias. How the hell do we find him? There's a way. Come on. Who is he? It's Hauser. Unbelievable. Welcome home. Yeah. - We'll let your father know you're here. - Thank you. So, Matthias is your father? Of course you don't remember that. Yes, he is. That's good to know. Airlock sealed. Cohaagen scours U.F.B. and The Colony every day looking for my father. The reason they can't find him is he's not there. After the wars, no one would be crazy enough to come out here. Everyone stays out of the No Zone. Makes sense. -Hey. -Hey. Almost there. You Okay? Yeah, I'm... Everyone seems to know me, but me. It's strange. Yeah. I can see he meant a lot to these guys. Yeah. He gave us the upper hand. And some of us were really able to see the best in him. What if the best is gone? I'm sorry. Hauser wasn't perfect, you know. Could be a real asshole sometimes. You're just trying to make me feel better. Maybe. It's working. Clear. He wants to see him alone. Don't go too far. Okay. Mr. Hauser. What is it you want? I want to help you. That is not the only reason you're here. I want to remember. Why? So I can be myself, be who I was. It is each man's quest to find out who he truly is, but the answer to that lies in the present, not in the past. As it is for all of us. But the past tells us who we've become. The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present. Look there. You'll find your answer. I am told you have information that may save us all. I am told the same. The firewall to the black box. We're in. There. You see? Jesus. Can you retrieve it? It's encrypted. What is this? Hello, Matthias. You can't imagine how much I've been looking forward to seeing you again. It's been far too long. You know, you're a very hard man to find. - It's a trap. - Shut it all down! Secure all entrances! Move! Move! Go, go, go! Get him out of here! Gun down now! Now! Well done. It's impressive. You'll be interested to know that there is no kill code. It was a fake. You're lying. Sorry. It was the only way to get to you. All this trouble for one man. Oh, never underestimate the power of one man. I know I don't. Father! No! No! We knew this day would come. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. No. Melina! - Lieutenant? - It's all here, sir. Matthias' defensive plans, troop numbers and location coordinates on every Resistance outpost in The Colony. The first wave of attack is already underway. Brilliant. Congratulations, my friend. Get him up, please. Up, up, Up. You did it. You're a hero. What is that? Modesty? No, no, no. Matthias is dead, The Colony is about to fall, and it's all thanks to you. I knew that I could trust you to stick to the plan. What are you talking about? Right. Yours is not the most reliable of memories, is it? It was really rather simple. Infiltrate the resistance, find Matthias' daughter. - No. No. - Get her to trust you. Yes. That's right. Once we discovered he was your father, we knew exactly who to target. Melina, he's lying. I'm afraid not. You see, that was also the easy part. Because seduction has always been his strongest suit. Still, it was Matthias that we needed to get to. He would need assurance far beyond mere words to let a man with your history, shall I say, come anywhere near him. But that is when you came up with the ingenious idea to feign capture and let us wipe your slate clean. Don't listen to him. It was just brilliant. What better way to convince the old man that you had really and truly turned against me. Melina, don't listen to him. Don't listen to him. - He's lying. - No, I'm not. Granted, there were a few hiccups along the way... You popping your cap at Rekall, for instance. That wasn't good. There it is! The old Hauser spirit. You're gonna need that. And then there was your lovely wife, who strayed from her directive. Look at me. She was ordered to bring you back alive. I'll deal with that later. But, you led us here, Hauser. You held up your part of the deal, and now I'm going to hold up mine. What do you mean? - No. - What are you doing? What are you... What are you doing? What you and I had been planning all along. We made sure to back up Hauser's memory before we sent him in there. This is what you wanted. - No. - Yes. Just think of it. In a few hours, you'll awake, and you will be the old Hauser once again. Loyal Patriotic. Ruthless. Now, what to do with you? I think we keep her. Leave her out of this. I'm in the fucking chair! I think the world will be very interested to hear the confession of Matthias' daughter. Denouncing her father and the Resistance. Fuck you! Cohaagen! You'll be very surprised to see how good Hauser is at beating a confession out of someone. God damn you, Cohaagen. You have me. Let her go. Let her go! Melina. Just try to relax. It'll all be over soon, I promise you. We'll be reunited very soon. And meanwhile, I have an invasion to lead. I wish I could forget that easily. Lori. Sweet dreams. Hold him still, Hammond. Do me a favor, asshole. Fight it as much as possible. Hurts more that way. Jesus, Hammond. Suspected reports of military mobilization in the U.F.B. have now been confirmed. But what was thought to be an operation to uproot terrorist leader Matthias appears to be on the scale of a full military invasion. An estimated 50,000 armed troops can be seen boarding The Fall, preparing to deploy for The Colony. The governor has issued a level-three alert to all districts of The Colony. Have the latest mission profiles been programmed into all our troops? Being distributed to all squadron commanders as we speak. Excellent. When do we depart? As soon as you give the order, sir. You have it. And find someplace for her, will you? Bay three access granted. We are a go on Code 310. Citizens of The Colony are to be considered hostile. Program all synthetics to use lethal force. Repeat, citizens of The Colony are to be considered hostile. We are a go on Code 310. Time travel to The Colony: approximately 17 minutes. This is Aristotle 8. Can you give me that rover ID again? You're breaking up. Was that a nine? - Are you all right? - Yeah. We got to get off this thing. Now. Your father... I'm so sorry. - All those things that Cohaagen said... - He was lying. I couldn't have betrayed you. I told you I'd find you. I remember. My whole life, only one memory stayed with me. They could never erase that. Damage report in bay six. - Are you ready? - Yeah. All emergency personnel, please report to bay six. Prepare for gravity shift. Drop your weapons! Now! Right now! Lieutenant, we've secured the prisoners attempting escape on level nine. The prisoner in bay six was just caught attempting escape. She was with a second individual, male. That's him. Deal with it. Come on. And the bag. Do it. Team leader two, team leader two. Seventh level prison... Entering core. It's okay. They're in stasis. Okay. Shit. Attention, emergency hatch cannot deploy -while in zero gravity. - What are you doing? Hauser, these doors don't open for a reason. We'll wait till it passes the core. Then we go. Shit. Gravity reversing. Come on. Take this. Hatch deployed. Commencing deceleration. Go! - Move! - Hatch deployed. Commencing deceleration. They're headed topside. What? I'm going after them. Lori, no. If they make it up top, I will deal with them. Just make sure those troops are activated and off-loaded the moment we arrive. Hauser is not stopping this invasion. Do you understand me? Follow them. Shit. We got to get to the aircraft bay. Come on. Go. No! Hauser! Secure him! Government officials have issued a Colony-wide state of emergency. All civilians are to evacuate their homes immediately and head to the nearest No Zone shelters outside The Colony border. Officials are urging everyone to comply with the evacuation orders. Continued bombings on Resistance holdouts... The Fall secured. Bays three through 87 now armed and active. Let's get them on the move now. You really are a disappointment, Hauser. I'm afraid it's time to erase those memories for good. Good-bye, old friend. Weapon systems activated. Ammo chamber is empty. Come on. - Weapons systems reloading. - Shit, come on. You really thought that would stop an entire invasion? No, but I think this Will. Look at you. You're still fighting and you don't even know who you are. I may not remember who I was, but I know who I am. Say hello to my wife for me. Come on! Run! Come on. Come on! Go! What is it? It'll be fine. Hey, hey. Hey, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Come on. Come on, come on. Hey, wake up. Hey! Come on, wake up. Wake up. Tell us your fantasy. We'll give you the memory. Don't mess with your mind, man. It ain't worth it. Secret agent. That's you. Right? Hi. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. We did it. No! Hey! There's no scar on your hand. Hey, hey! Come on! Did you think I'd let you leave without a kiss good-bye? "Till death do us part," right, baby? That's right. Drop the weapon now! It's all right. It's him. You okay, sir? - Yeah. - You sure? We've got a medic down in here. Oh, my God. Thank you. People are spilling into the streets all across The Colony, celebrating what many hope will finally be a path to an independent nation. A new page in history has been turned as the invasion so many feared ended with the destruction of The Fall, a longtime symbol of economic and political oppression. No word yet on the fate of Chancellor Cohaagen, but we are being told that he perished along with his forces. Jesus Christ. I know. It's hard to believe, isn't it? Hey, what is it? Hey, you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You sure?
