Good rnorning! Welcorne to the studio. We were worried you rnight not get here in tirne. Airports today... You know! My narne's Clara. We spoke on the phone several tirnes. I'rn very excited about this series. It's going very well. Last week a filrn not nearly as good as yours polled about 8 rnillion viewers. Excellent. We've got two rninutes to go. You should sign the release. Have Nichetti sign the release. Just a forrnality. We're rnore bureaucratic than the State, always sornething to be signed. Everyone has to sign the release. As I was saying, the series is really going great. No, Nichetti, this way. The studio is ready. Do you rnind if we get a rnove on? We can avoid rnake up and... Shall we do "L'Arrnée des Ornbres" by Melville or Frankenheirner's "The Manchurian Candidate"? Well, actually we've got Nichetti. - Nichetti? - Nichetti. You want rne to present Melville and Frankenheirner after Nichetti's children? Don't worry, I'll do close ups and they won't even see the photographs. - Is Nichetti here? - Yes, he's with Clara. Ready! Studio 3, ready! On the air in two rninutes! - Corne with rne. - Studio 3, everybody on the floor. Now rernernber, the presentation has to be short. We've got three rninutes, then I start the Arnpex. Studio 3, everybody on the floor. On the air in two rninutes! I'rn always the last one to know. I've studied Melville for ages. I've done rny hornework on Frankenheirner, but Nichetti! Well, I'll just irnprovise. Pull back carnera 2. Carnera 3 rnore to the left. No, I shan't use N° 1. Go ahead with the bars. I don't wanna even see carnera 1! What happens? Oh, you're so funny, like on the screen! Go on! Don't worry, I'll call the dressrnaker. Ready? Everybody out! We're on air. No, I've been waiting since 5, I gotta right to work too! When she's finished with the air spray, we'll begin. We're always the last to be told. What's the title of the filrn? - "The Icicle Thief." - Thank you. - Silence! - Silence! Anna, how rnany tirnes I have to tell you to go to bed! Leave the "rnagic box" alone! "Capitol" is starting. Will you let rne see it this week or not? Darling, they never let us watch "Capitol". Anna, go and get into your pyjarnas and leave the box alone! After the brief outline of the series... There are no cartoons at this tirne of night. Off to bed! This evening's filrn is "The Icicle Thief" by Maurizio Nichetti. The title rnight suggest a parody of a basic rnornent in Italian neo-realisrn, but actually it's rnuch rnore irnportant. Don't be led astray by the title. "The Icicle Thief" is an act of love airned at the Italian cinerna and at neo-realisrn in particular. With this filrn, Nichetti, like other cornic authors, has blossorned in the drarnatic vein. We rnust not be surprised if Nichetti's cinerna is full of echoes, quotes and rerniniscences of a glorious past while being of a self-aware rnodernity. It is enough to rnention the key scene of the filrn. Antonio Pierrnattei, the hero, becornes paralysed after a car accident. His wife, shocked by this tragedy, is forced into prostitution. The denouernent is reached when their children arrive at the orphanage. I would say that... Since we gotta see this filrn why don't you turn down the sound? How can you enjoy it if they tell you the story first? I know what you're going to say, that I can see a filrn 5 tirnes. Sure, because I forget the story, but if sorneone tells it to rne two rninutes before I see it... Never rnind... The question that this filrn poses is: Why has Nichetti rediscovered drarna? Nichetti answers in irnages like a real author who knows that only with irnages can a filrn director explain the past and interpret the present. Arnpex rolling. Thank heavens! The first bit's over. Well done, Nichetti. You did very well. THE ICICLE THIEF Get out! Baldi Ettore. Caluso Nicola. Pierrnattei. Antonio Pierrnattei. Antonio, they're calling you! I'rn Pierrnattei. Sorry, you're the first, but on the rejection list. This rnorning too? They just give rne the narnes, it ain't rny fault there's no work. Is it our fault then? - What are you going to do? - I'rn going horne. I heard the Balani yard is taking on rnen. Girlies, what about the gestures? Just one rnore tirne. Watch rne. Maestro, couldn't you sneeze in tirne? - It cornes and goes, it's hay-fever. - Well, knock it off! Isn't there any work? Not even for a few days? Hey, please! Where's your bike? Morn's using it. Today we're walking. Mornrny! Mornrny! Hi, Bruno! Help your rnother. Carry the shopping. Is this the tirne to corne horne? I forgot sornething, that's why I'rn late. - What did you buy to eat? - What I could afford. Bruno, look for the keys. You have rnade an ornelet! I bought two eggs! They were already broken. Go on up! You and your broken eggs. Bruno, darling, open the door. Bruno, please, wash the cabbage. I'rn very busy. Leave the bike alone and go into the kitchen. Can't you fix the bells after dinner? Antonio, are you tired? I'rn tired of eating cabbage. Then go to the diner, there's no choice here! I know there's no choice, but I'd rather find the cabbage ready on the table! I spend the whole day looking for work and corne horne to a pigsty! I can't pass rny days like this because she wants to go on the stage! My wife's an actress! Maria, corne to your sense. Singing won't buy us food. Does what you earn buy us food? Tell rne how rnuch you rnade today! And yesterday? And the day before? I go to the job site every rnorning. There's no work, it's not rny fault. If you'd been srnarter, you'd have a job, like Penati. But he's a black-rnarketeer, a crirninal. - But he doesn't eat cabbage. - Hush! Not in front of the kids! You know what you are? A good for nothing! Stop it, Maria, or I'll blow rny top! Yes, let everybody see what you're like! - Don't slarn the door! - I'll slarn it! Bruno! Bruno! Good evening, Don Italo! Hello! Are you having supper? No, I'rn still cooking the cabbage. Turn up the gas, we've got the service at 9. Yes, I rernernber. I'rn expecting you, okay? Did you wash your hands? Go and wash thern. And don't waste the soap! When he washes it's like he eats the soap. - It's better than cabbage. - Funny! Enigrna Bath Foarn. Francesco, don't rnake rne say it 10,000 tirnes! Go to bed! Anna's asleep already. Always playing with that building set! That "Splash" cornrnercial again. How rnany years is it, Massirno? 8 at least. We weren't even rnarried and I was living with Angela and Luisa. I rnust call thern one day. Hey, Massirno, I haven't felt the baby since yesterday. Usually he kicks at once when I watch TV. Can you splash? The Director's pants. - Where is he? - Out there in his underpants. We'll have to find hirn sornething. I rnust have sorne suits in wardrobe. Cheap rnaterial. Please turn down the rnonitors' sound in the studio! Ready, action for Melville! "L'Arrnée des Ornbres" dates frorn 1969. Melville directed it 4 years before his death. Don't worry, our dressrnaker can work rniracles. You'll have your clothes before the filrn is over. But... I'd like to see the filrn, just to rnake sure... - There's a cornrnercial break right now. - That's exactly what I want to check. Thank you, Madarn. Paul Meurisse, Sirnone Signoret are at the heart of the filrn. A great exarnple of how one can return to the country's history without being rhetorical but with the courage of one's convictions. This is Jean-Pierre Melville. It's not bad like that. If we hurry, we can still see a bit of the filrn. Corne with rne, we'll go to the studio. Follow rne. Mind the cables. - The cornrnercial break is still on. - It's alrnost over. What's your rnornrny doing and why is your dad crying? Bruno, get changed. Your dad's waiting. Is there sornething wrong in your farnily? Do rnorn and dad get along? Look rne in the eye. Rernernber the eighth cornrnandrnent. "Thou shalt not bear false..." It's a sin to tell a lie. Tell rne the truth: Do rnorn and dad get along? Why do they quarrel? Because rnorn wants dad to be a black rnarketeer. But the war's over! Don Italo, rnay I go now? Wipe over the floor, I'll tell your father you'll be late. Understand? Antonio, corne down frorn there! Good evening! Is Bruno still there? Corne, rny son. I've got to talk to you. Has Bruno been hurt? What is it? - I know everything. - Everything? About what? It's a sharne for your farnily and the parish. For the parish? But... I'rn not doing anything. But you're trying to... Yes, even Maria says try to... - Don't listen Maria. - What do you rnean, don't listen to her? A good father looks for a job. Yes, but no rnatter how I look, I can't earn a penny. Honest poverty is better than the Devil's Gold. Not even the Devil offered rne a job. Don't joke about it. If I help you find a job, will you prornise rne sornething? Anything! We'll rnake a pact. If I find you a job, you give up black-rnarket! What black-rnarket? Stop, thief! Paint it well, Bruno. Tornorrow rnorning I want it with a cross-bar because I'll get on rny bike and go to work. Antonio, I'rn sorry, but are you joking? Get up at 6, clean shirt and off to the factory! Antonio, are you joking? No, never in rny life have I joked about work. - Where are you going to work? - To the Lux. - At the glass factory? - Yes. Just think, we'll have 11,000 lire a rnonth! To the Lux... You're lovely, Maria! - You're lovely. - You're lovelier. I've got to iron that shirt well because Antonio Pierrnattei doesn't go to work in a wrinkled shirt. Make rne an ornelet too! Tornorrow I want a lunch box with bread and ornelet. - We get a lunch break, you know! - Jesus, I thank you. Do you know who we should thank? Don Italo. He put in a word for rne at the factory Just think, 10 days paid vacation, Sundays off and rnedical assistance for the whole farnily. Now we can all get sick! Since you work at the glass factory, rnaybe we can afford a chandelier like the one I saw in a rnovie once. It was lovely, it had 8 bulbs and all round thern were glass flowers and leaves. The glass was so shiny it was like pearl! When you switched it on... it lit up all the walls. I've always drearned of having a chandelier like that, even down in the air-raid shelter during the war. I always thought that the war would soon be over and that then I would have had a house with a big roorn and in the rniddle a beautiful chandelier. I'rn sure they rnake chandeliers like that at the Lux factory. Maria, I prornise that I'll... The artichoke-based aperitif against the stress of rnodern life. They interrupted the line! No, he had finished his line. I ought to know considering I wrote it! Silence! Jean-Pierre Melville was asked to direct "Week-end a Zuydcoote" that was finally directed by Henri Verneuil. If you're sure, you've the right to cornplain. Sure! It's tirne we faced up to breaks for cornrnercials and get respect for people's work! - Respect for people's work! - I already said that. Corne with rne, please. It's "Big-Big". Yes, we are watching the "Big-Big" cornrnercial. Do you like the jingle? It's so silly! Yes, it's a pretty tune... Francesco eats thern all the tirne. I can't stand the sight of thern. Yes, the turnrny's getting bigger. I haven't felt the baby since yesterday. I'rn not worried. I know you didn't feel rne for 15 days. Don't exaggerate. I'rn not worried. I felt hirn just now! What a coincidence! Yes, okay! Don't worry. Bye. Frorn next rnonth on I'll buy you everything you want! Eat sorne potatoes, corne on. Francesco, that's enough! Off to bed now! Stop eating that junk! You never say anything to your son. - Will you buy rne the "Big-Big"? - What? - What did he say? - It's the snack that rnakes you grow. Potatoes aren't enough for the young gentlernan any rnore. #Eat a "Big-Big", eat it. Go on, eat it! # This is one of your songs. I never heard the "Big-Big" before. It's one of your crazy tunes that you sing in the theatre. He rnust have heard it on the radio. - We haven't got a radio. - Your sister has one. We haven't been there for one year. Listen, I don't know this song. Did you take Bruno to the rehearsals? No, but suppose I had? - So it's true. - Only once. One artist isn't enough, you want to ruin rny son too? He's only a kid, he's got to have sorne fun. He's 6 years old! He's got to go to wor... to school, right? Who sent hirn to work at the gas station? Work? Don't exaggerate! He enjoys hirnself when he is busy. Well, try to enjoy yourself too! And don't slarn the door in rny face. You understand? I didn't slarn it, it's the draft! Maria, keep calrn and don't rnake rne lose rny ternper. Keep calrn! I'rn totally calrn! #Eat, go on, eat a Big-Big! # Don Italo, you've corne to pay us a visit. - Have you lost sornething? - I was looking for Paolo. - The baby? - Where's the baby? Why did you corne here? You've two kids and you corne here to waste your tirne! Sandra, corne here! All you think about is lifting up your skirts... Maria, hurry up! Lift up that skirt! I understand, Don Italo, I'rn going horne. No, you're very good. It's a great show. It'll be a great success. Maria! "It had 8 bulbs" "and all round thern were glass flowers and leaves." "The glass was so shiny it was like pearl." "Then when you switched it on it lit up all the walls." Knocking off tirne! Everybody horne! Everybody horne! Mario, corne on! Corne on, everybody horne! #Now your rnornrny's# #got to perfurne you. # #You've got to rnake yourself pretty# #because daddy's corning horne. # You too can plunge into the freshness of... Keep calrn! It's a blackout! Everybody on the floor! We'll wait for orders frorn the Direction. But the presentation of "L'Arrnée des Ornbres" you got all that, didn't you? Do we have to do it over? We'll be here all night! My rnother-in-law was corning to dinner this evening. What's happened? The power's failed in the whole district. Luckily during a cornrnercial. I wouldn't want the viewers... Miss! Miss! There! I've found a torch. I don't want to do Melville again. Get rne Lubitsch! - The paper, right? - Of course, not the rnan hirnself! Miss! - You can sleep at rny place. - What about rny rnother-in-law? She'll sleep with your husband. Where's he got to? Nichetti! We're in the dark here! What about there? Yes, we went out into the street, no lights anywhere. It's back! Sorry I bothered you, but I got scared. Yes, even the television is back. So what's happened here? He's stolen the chandelier? He rnust have been scared of being in the dark too. I'rn sorry, Morn, I forgot. Everybody loved your purnpkin ravioli. Maybe a little bit too sweet? Don't worry. Massirno ate two helpings. All right, Morn, I'll tell hirn. Morn's sending us sorne rnore purnpkin ravioli. We'll give thern to Signora Maria like last tirne. Help! Help! Please help! Dad's horne! Watch the spaghetti! Bruno, where's dad? Didn't corne to get you? Poor dad! First day at work and already doing overtirne! What a state you're in. Let's go and get you washed. You're like a chirnney sweeper! I'll give you a new face! You're a rnasterpiece! When your dad cornes horne he won't recognize you. He'll say: "Who is this child? This rnasterpiece?" Paolo, don't touch the spaghetti! - Antonio! Hi, Antonio! - Hi. What happened to your jacket? Don't just stand there, give our guest a chair. And he has to get a foreigner! And he has the nerve to bring her horne! - Maria... - Half naked, in front of the children. - There's a rnisunderstanding. - Disgusting! Stop! Listen to rne. There was an accident. - I'rn going to do sornething crazy! - Please, listen to rne. I was down by the ditch, so I laid her down the bank... And you are telling rne this? What were you doing by the ditch with a girl like this? Now, don't get rne wrong. - You haven't understood a thing. - I've understood everything. And don't shout in rny house in front of the children! - I'rn talking quiet. - You've been with a sharneless hussy! Where did you find her? In a ditch? You've done disgusting things with a sharneless hussy! A half naked foreigner! Don't tell rne what you did, respect the children! Corne here and please tell her. If you won't listen to rne, at least listen to her. Listen to what she says. Have you heard? I can't understand a word she says. Nor can I, but she says she was drowning in the ditch. I saved her, but I had never seen her before. I don't even know her narne. My narne is Bruno. Maria... I rnade rnyself beautiful, I even put on this cornb. Then I washed Bruno and Paolo because when dad cornes horne we've got to celebrate. I wanted to celebrate with you too. I brought a chandelier. A big one with pearly glass. Really? Where is it? I had it on rny handle bars. Right up to the ditch I had it. I rnust have lost it when I saved the girl. Why do you lie to rne? I'rn not lying to you. I lost it in the ditch. - I don't believe you. - I swear it. I just can't believe you anyrnore. I'll take you there and we'll find it, you'll see, it was a lovely chandelier. It had the bulbs, the drops, just the way you like it. If we find it, you'll have to believe rne. I'rn going to do sornething crazy! Chandelier. - Chandelier! - Chandelier? This is where I found her. I went down here. Here's the stick! I saved her with this! I put it into the water and pulled her to the bank. The chandelier rnust have fallen off sornewhere. Perhaps it fell into the water. Why do you keep telling rne this nonsense? I've told the truth. Look at rne! Don't touch rne! Don't ever touch rne again. I don't like the look on your face. Keep calrn. Now I'll find the chandelier. I'rn going to do sornething crazy! I'rn going to do sornething crazy! Maria! I've found it! What are you doing? Where are you going? Maria! Maria! Don't be satisfied with half rneasures! Today you can ask rnore of your washing rnachine! Away with greyness! Bring colour into your life with Vialblu! Thank you, Vialblu! This isn't rny filrn, it's all been changed. I want it stopped! There rnust be a rnisunderstanding. What rnisunderstanding? You tell hirn the real story of "The Icicle Thief." It's the story of an unrepentant libertine who asks for an interview with Mephistolfeles. Actually it is frorn a play by Laszlo Bus-Fekete... No, that's "Heaven Can Wait", Lubitsch '43. No, Antonio Pierrnattei becarne paralysed, his wife a prostitute and his children inrnates of an orphanage. Sure, the filrn had a tragic ending. No, rny filrn ended up tragically. Is the story very different frorn yours? Totally! This is a different filrn! Stop the broadcast! No, the Arnpex cornes frorn Rorne. Then sornething rnust be done, there's no tirne to be lost. Sandro, shall we all go horne? Clear the floor! What an irnpossible job. A shirt ruined every tirne. Alt! Stop! Get out, corne on! To the station! It's no good looking there. She can't have ended up in the rniddle of the river. Look rnore to the right, here, by the tree. They say there's a hole there. No, there rnust be a hole over by the bush. Here, closer to the bank. She rnust have ended up in the reed, it's logical, well, look. Now, what really happened? I've already told you ten tirnes. Well, I want to hear it for the eleventh. We arrived at 11:30 yesterday evening. What for? In such a lonely place at 11:30? Don Italo, I can't take it anyrnore! Tell the truth. The truth, for the sake of your conscience. What were you doing at that tirne in a place like that with Maria Lo Giudice, rnarried narne Pierrnattei, your wife? We were looking for a chandelier, I already told you. Sure, there are lots of chandeliers in places like that. I love Maria. Where did you buy the chandelier? Were there any witnesses? Sorne wornan, rnaybe? No, we were alone. Did you quarrel often? Never, or at least just like any other farnily. Don Italo knows. Occasionally, but nothing serious. Don't you ever quarrel? Where are they taking rne? I'rn innocent! Ask Maria, she knows everything! I know she isn't dead. Let go of rne! What do you think, Father? Did you know thern well? I'rn innocent! She was a good girl, a bit arnbitious rnaybe, she wanted hirn to rnake easy rnoney, the black-rnarket, rninor crirnes. Perhaps there was an argurnent, a rnornent of anger. I'rn sure that even if he did throw her into the water, he didn't want to harrn her. Poor girl! Taxi! Taxi! There is nobody here? - Only on Sundays. - What about the other days? Factory workers don't take taxis to go to work. - Where do you want to go? - To the glass factory, at 7:30. - I pass right by it, if you like. - Will it stand the weight? - Sure. - I'll steer, though. A wornan was killed here last night. He was a black-rnarketeer. She didn't want to be a whore. Who told you this nonsense? Our landlady has a son in the Carabinieri. Shut up and pedal! Stop, stop! You've been very kind. How rnuch do I owe you? I'll rernernber your character for rny next filrn. - You're not Pierrnattei. - Of course I'rn not. I'rn looking for hirn. Have you seen hirn? Help! I dernand an explanation! You don't know who I arn! - You're a friend of Pierrnattei's. - So you're a thief! Antonio is honest. I've been here 10 years and there was never a theft! - Pierrnattei stole a chandelier. - He's a thief! Where does he live? If we knew, we'd be there right now! Ask the priest. The one who got hirn the job. Don Italo! Why didn't I think of that before? To Don Italo's church. To Don Italo's church! Hurry! They killed a wornan here. I know... Enough of this bullshit already! Keep pedalling. Good rnorning, Don Italo. Who are you? I've never seen you before. On the other hand, I know you quite well. What can I do for you? I'd like the address of Pierrnattei Antonio and Maria, your parishioners, they've 2 children. You certainly rernernber thern. Where do they live? Do you know what happened? Nasty story! No, the story is quite different. Don't criticize stories until you have seen the end. I'll give you the address. Next tirne I'll take a clear shot of the narne of the street, so as I won't have to ask. The Pierrnatteis live, or lived, in Via Ugo Tornrnei 4, in Calvairate. Thank you! What can I do in exchange? You can wipe over the floor. Bruno won't be corning today. I can't blarne hirn after all that has happened. Since you're taller, you can clean the windows too. They're so dirty. Cornrnercials! Who are you? I'rn a farnily friend. I know you as if you were rny own kids. I could rnove around here blindfolded. Here's the bathroorn, here's the kitchen, here's the bedroorn and here... Where's the bicycle? - I sold it. - What? You, with the bicycle wheels, should have rnade a wheelchair for your paralyzed father. My father's quite well. Pity! He should have been knocked down by a truck going horne frorn work with the chandelier on the handle bars and your rnother should be whoring to feed the farnily. What? You wouldn't know, you're too young. You and your brother should have gone to the orphanage. Don't pull that long face. The orphanage was only in the last scene alrnost on the end titles. Are you still here? You should go back to advertising. I'rn in the cinerna and I'rn staying. And you can speak Italian? Yes, Bruno's rny teacher. We have fun together. Don't take the initiative, I'rn the director! - Where's your father? - In prison. How did that happen? Is he all right, anyway? He's okay. He eats, sleeps and doesn't have to work, just like when he was at horne. I've got to sort this story out. Now you stay right here. For the sake of the filrn, you'll end up in the orphanage! Now you stay here! Locatelli Paolo. Caputo's getting rnarried. - What did you say his narne was? - Locatelli Paolo. Caputo's getting rnarried. Pierrnattei, he was arrested by rnistake. He borrowed a chandelier frorn the factory where he worked. He stole it. No, it was just a kind thought for his wife. He was going to give it back, an idea for the screen-play. - Sir? - What? For Caputo's wedding. Can't you see I'rn working? Later, later. He was going to pay for it out of his pay. Antonio is honest. - Yeah! He drowned his wife. - When? - Where? - At Irnbersago. Go to the political rneeting with two cars. I had the Pierrnattei file. No, I'll deal with that, okay? If we can find the chandelier, I'rn sure I can pick up the story frorn the point where it went wrong. - Find it yourself. - Where shall I look? How should I know? Must be in sornebody's house. I can't get in, you have search warrants. I'rn supposed to search the whole city? Have I got to do it on rny own? You've rnade your report, so that's all right. - Sir? - Sir? Caputo. Here you go. A 10,000 lire banknote. It's for Caputo, isn't it? - That's a rnonth's pay! - Don't talk nonsense! You give at least 10,000 lire for a wedding gift, don't you? - Where did you get this? - What do you think? Let rne see. There are rnany... It's counterfeit! I've never seen one of these before! - No! It's genuine! - Take hirn away! What do you rnean, take hirn away? Give rne back rny wallet! - They're all forged! - You're rnaking a terrible rnistake! I'll see you in prison and you'll be charged. They're all forged! Don Italo! Don Italo! Don Italo, I've got to talk to you. Are you sure? Then we can't waste tirne, let's hurry! You can't shut rne here! There's no prison or lawyer in rny filrn! Who's going to defend rne now? Don't shout, it won't do any good. - Antonio! - I'rn here by rnistake too. - What did they put you in for? - They say I killed rny wife. - Maria isn't dead. - Yes, I know. But while they keep rne here I can't go and find her. It'll all be cleared up. Do you have faith in the cinerna? Who has the tirne to go? You're free. I was sure the rnisunderstanding would be cleared up. No, not you. Pierrnattei, corne on. Did you find Maria? No, but Don Italo has had a confession that clears you. - Antonio... - Don Italo! So I'rn free! Brigadiere, what about rne? For you, things are going badly: Prerneditated rnurder. Don Italo has heard Bruno's evidence. You'll get life. You're joking! Why should I kill Maria? She's rny favourite character. Besides, she's got to whore for her children. It's the strongest scene in the filrn. You can send your sister to the orphanage. - Bruno! - Stop! - No! Think of the child! - Follow hirn! The artichoke-based aperitif against the stress of rnodern life. The artichoke-based aperitif against the stress of rnodern life. What are you doing here? Get back into the filrn, you should be in the orphanage! Enigrna Bath Foarn. Don't be satisfied with half rneasures! Ask rnore of your washing rnachine. Away with greyness! Bring colour into your life and that of your children. Vialblu, for a life full of colour! - What are you doing, Maria? - I'rn singing! You'd better go horne, everybody's looking for you. I'rn never going back to that squalid life. But your farnily and your story are on the other side! I want a life full of colour! Bruno! I feel worse doing these exercises. I get rnore agitated. Perhaps I'rn doing sornething wrong. What's that? Filrn or cornrnercial? If it's black and white it's the filrn. If it's colour, cornrnercial. Move a bit.
