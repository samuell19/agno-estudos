I figured you deserve that after six months on the wagon. So I should reward myself for not smoking... With a cigarette? I’m dying here. Al Pacino. Dog day afternoon. No, actually, that’s ray Bennett in... The worst financial mistake I ever made. Come on, man. It’s not that bad. Somebody had to check out all these bad boys. Yeah, I did. Ray, you need a woman, and you need a woman bad. And i’m not talking about this three-day rental shit, man. You gotta get up off your ass, ray. She’s not gonna come waltzing in here any time soon. Yeah, I know. She’s out there, though, somewhere. This whole Sci-Fi thing ain’t working. We should try a porno thing or something. All right. Maybe we could do, like, a two for one... Like the big guys do. Pez, I got somethin’ on my mind. Somethin’ I need to talk to you about. I had an offer to sell the store. Shh, what are you gonna tell ’em? I priced ’em kinda high, ’cause I don't really wanna sell it, but... If they don’t take my offer, i’ll spit in their eye. James cagney, angels with dirty faces. You need to come up with some new material. Well, if it’s good enough for cagney, it’s good enough for me. I think i’m gonna take off. Well, you gonna come back this afternoon? No, I think i’m gonna take a few days off. I need to think about this whole video thing. Hope they turn out to be flakes. Would you miss this place? Hell, no. I’ll just... Just take all the porn. Hey... never know when you’re gonna need it. Don’t forget to lock up. Subject’s name: John Doe. Age: I don’t know. Height: Kinda tall. Weight: Fat as shit. Don’t forget to pick up ground beef on the way home. C.j. My god. Harley Dakota. Holy shit. Well... sorry. What the hell are you doing here? Did you break out of prison? No. No. I got paroled early for good behavior. Can you believe that? Anyone here? You just missed red. He came by to drop off the stiff. Lucky for you. Yeah. I could never get used to this. Guess it’s still working, though? It’s great, man. Gin hooked me up with this bogus coroner’s license. I get to write my own prescription for free drugs and never even finished high school. And it beats turning tricks and giving gin all the dough. Besides, every once in a while, I get some asshole on the slab who’ll fuck me. Makes it all worthwhile. Want a drink? No. No, no, no. I didn’t like this place then. Definitely don’t like it now. So how is gin? More fucked up every day. He’s holed up in some junkyard office. The place is starting to look like some kind of wacko Christmas village. He’s limping now too. Tono broke both his legs. So I guess they know about the money? Yeah. When you got sent up, they dug through all the shipments they still had... And found about two million bucks missing. You better get out of here. If gin finds you, i’m gonna be stuffing cash in your guts. Shit. Well, well, well. The rumors are true. I heard they were lettin’ you out for good behavior, but I figured it was bullshit. Nice shirt. Two years in the slammer, and you’re still a smart mouth. What do you want? This is fate, me running into you like this. Gin’s gonna wanna talk to you. Well, why don’t you tell him you just never saw me? Why would I wanna do that? Because I never rolled over on you guys. Just get in the fucking car. Whoa, hey, it’s cool, it's cool. Yeah, it is cool. Why don’t you tell gin, if he wants to speak to me, he can meet me someplace warm and sunny. Why are you making this hard, Harley? Don’t be a bitch. Things are just gonna get ugly. - Need a ride? - You wanna see ugly? Why don’t you take a look at your shirt. I paid good money for this shirt.

God, you could hang meat in here. Well, what did she tell c.J.? Well... You didn’t think to talk to c.J.? Don’t worry about it, boss. I mean, you know, it’s taken care of, okay? Great.

No. You know, the speed limit’s 55. - Was I speeding? - No, but if you go any slower, we’ll be going backwards. Everybody’s in such a hurry these days. Yeah. My name’s ray. I don’t usually pick up hitchhikers. You know, everybody says they’re con men or criminals. Guess I got lucky with you, though? - Mind if I smoke? - Actually, I do. It’s not good for you. Secondhand smoke’s not good for you, either. Please? Sure. Shoot! Man, something’s the matter with my car. Fuck. I got the tire out like you said. I cannot believe you’ve never changed a tire before. Gosh, i’ve just been lucky, I guess. "Gosh"? Are you a priest or something? No. I own a video store. Same thing. Need any help with them doodads? Lug nuts. They’re called lug nuts. - So what’s your name? - Harley. Harley? Is that your last name or your first name or... Harley. Just Harley. You always this chatty? No. I-I was just trying to make some conversation. Don’t. Hello, c.J. Hello, asshole. This place must be affecting your manners. You treat everybody like a stiff. I call ’em like I see 'em. Hey. What do you know? It’s Louie guianni. I popped him last week. You must be proud. What’s the attitude, c.J.? You know i’m not here to shoot the shit. So what do you want? What did Harley say about the money? What money? Keep fucking with me! Yeah, keep pulling my arm. Love to tell gin how you spilled hydrochloric acid all over tono’s 40 grand. Nah. Gin ain’t gonna like this. I’m trembling beyond control. Gee. Okay, that’s the way you wanna play it. Shit. Look, if you don’t believe me... Here. I can handle gin. Where are you gonna go now? It’s probably better I don’t tell you. You better get out of here. If gin finds you, i’m gonna be stuffing cash in your guts. What do you think of my new jacket? I like it. I look like a fucking doorman. That was the first job I ever had for tono. Did you know that? Yeah. Of course you did. Standing outside all day, frying like a fucking omelet. Worst goddamn gig of my whole life. What about Harley? She’s a smart girl. Always was. You sure this professional knows what he’s doing? He’d better. Yeah. There, that completes it. Yeah. So where are you headed? Williams, Arizona. Yeah? What’s in Williams? More rocks. I’m not going anywhere, really. I’m just taking a few days off. Just trying to kick back and relax a little bit. Yeah, i’m sure the pressure of running a video store is unbearable. It may not sound like much to you, but to me it’s a really big deal. What do you know about someone like me? I read your bag. And you know what they say about hitchhikers, right? Well, you didn’t kill anybody or anything, did you? Why? Would that bother you? Relax, ray. I didn’t kill anybody. - Did you steal somebody’s car? - No, I didn’t steal anyone's car. Listen, ray, if I can’t smoke... You can’t talk. It’s just, i’ve never talked to anybody that’s been in prison before. Let’s just say, it was a victimless crime, okay? Are you hungry? What can I get ya? I’ll have... Um... let me guess. The gentleman will have a hatchet burger, medium, plain, American cheese, French fries, milk shake... Vanilla... and a glass of water. Am I right? Pretty much. What about dessert? Apple pie? Rhubarb. - Very exotic. - What about you? Two meat loaf specials, extra gravy, a very large beer. My daddy always said you gotta eat when you can. That would be your daddy in... In two-way, Kentucky. Where’s your Southern accent? Back home with the inbreds. So is Harley your real name? Stage name. Well, you’re pretty enough to come out west and be a showgirl. Am I? Yeah. Well, I didn’t come out to be a showgirl. I came out to be a magician’s assistant. Ready? Very quick? I sucked. No, i... I came out with this guy. One loser in a long string of losers. Yeah, his biggest trick was hiding the sausage in the cocktail girl. I think she likes me. So if harley’s your stage name, what’s your real name? A magician never tells her secrets. I’ll buy you lunch if you tell me. Ever repeat it, and you’ll be wearing your lunch. Deal. Olive Dee klintucker. - Harley’s a nice name. - Very good answer. I’ll be right back. Where are you going? I gotta pee. She’s quite a handful. That she is. Pretty girl. Girl like that, she could make your head spin, get you so topsy-turvy, you don’t know what's what. Easier to forget all your troubles. Won’t give you new ones. Well, just keep the straight and narrow. You’ll be fine. Okay. Bye. You gotta be shittin’ me! Yes, get the food to go. Where’d you learn how to do that? In the pen. Hey, he’s a big guy. We gotta get outta here. I didn’t scare you or anything? No. I’m just not used to being around women like you. Yeah? Hey, man, how much longer do I have to stay in there and get my ass kicked by this quiver? You lay a hand on her, and the deal’s off. Now she’s hooked up with this numb-nuts. Is he part of the deal now too? Really? Interesting. Look, gin... just keep an eye on both of them. No rough stuff. Yeah, I got it. You have a really sexy profile. You know that? I do? Is it getting hot in here? Um... no. Shit. We’re in Williams. You can let me out here, actually. So, where are you headed now? Well, I think i’ll hang it up for the night. That place over there looks as good as any. Okay. - Hey, um... - Yeah? Nothing. I’ll see you. Good luck to you, ray. - You too. - Okay. In a second. Can I help you? What can I do for you? I’d like a room. I’ll see what I can do. Smoking or non-smoking? Non-smoking. We only got smoking. I guess that’ll have to do. Cash? Charge? I’m particular about certain credit cards I take. Cash. $49.50. $53.46 with tax. Fill out... just one of those. That’s 55. Change tomorrow when you check out? Just, just sign your name. This is 218. Up the stairs, back of the hall. I go to bed at 11:00. There’s a plunger in the room. Don’t call. Ice buckets in the room? No. I got ’em here if you want a bucket. Please. Yeah? Bucket. Let’s see what we got. Hey! Hey. Hey. This place doesn’t look so bad. Yeah, it’s all right. What happened to your mouth? Sssss. I must’ve bit my lip. Anyway... So I was thinking, you know, I don’t really know anyone around here... And, thinking I was gonna get a room. Well, I got the last one. How many beds? Two. Do you snore? I wouldn’t know. Okay. Meet you upstairs. Hey, how tall are you, by the way? Six. Why? Just curious. Leave the door open. - Don’t get into any trouble. - Yeah, yeah. Suppose you heard a lot of crazy shit about gin? Fuckin’ Santa claus. Yeah, listen, it’s tono who fucked him up. A couple years ago, he had a discrepancy about a few thousand bucks. He broke both his legs. Now he just sits in his freezer all day long, pretending like every day is Christmas. Yeah, well, i’m not gonna be his fuckin’ elf. You don’t have to worry. What do I have to do, sit on his lap and tell him what I want? He might like that. Wow. Close that fucking door! I got the new guy, boss. You’re the guy Eddie the macho sent from Jersey? - What’s your name? - Vinnie pipillino. But everybody calls me the pipe. Well, I don’t care if everybody calls you pippi longstocking. You better be as good as Eddie says you are. Tell me what you need; I’ll take care of it. No problem. You got a lot of confidence. I hope it ain’t attitude. No way. I know about respect. You know about respect? - See that? - Yeah. What are you, mute? Do you see that or not? Yeah, I see it. What do you think that is? A hat. Look at that. Fuckin’ genius. Yeah. That... is a reminder of the importance of respect. You know how I started out in this business? As a fucking doorman. Nine fucking years standing in the mojave heat, melting like a snow cone, opening doors for cocky young pricks like you. I swear to god, heat like that can make you want to lock yourself in a freezer. But for nine fucking years... I never bitched, I never called in sick, I never stayed home for a fucking holiday... Not even Christmas, if you can believe that. So one day, tono says to me, "hey, kid, how come you never come to me complaining about your gig?" And I says to him, "Mr. Tono..." notice, I always said "mister." I says to him, "Mr. Tono, "you’re a smart man. "That’s how come you’re running things. "You’re a smart man, and I respect you. "I know that whatever it is you have me do... "It’s for the good of the business... "And I respect that. "So you don’t ever have to worry that any work I ever do for you that i’ll complain about it. ’cause I got more respect than that." And he says to me, "you’ve got a good attitude, kid. Why don’t you come by the office Monday, we’ll talk." And the rest is history. I’ve been running tono's money business for three years now. That makes me the number two guy. But that hat will always stay right where it is... So that it will always remind me about the importance of respect and what respect can get you. Now, you wanna come work for me, you want to break into the west coast end of things, no problem. But you better know what the fuck you’re talking about... When you start talking to me about respect. ’cause I am the goddamn emperor of respect! So... you still wanna tell me all about how you got respect? No... sir. Mr. Gin... sir. Get outta here. Close that fucking door! What the fuck was that? Come on, shit for brains. I ain’t got all day. Comin’ in? I forgot my trunks. Me too. Between rival factions along the israeli/syria border. This young lady claims she’s staying with you. She is. Then I suggest you read the rules listed in the lobby... For swimming pool use, since your guest clearly did not. Rule number two: No swimming in the pool without proper bathing attire. Undergarments are not proper bathing attire. Rule number five: No pool use after 9:00 P.M. I’m-I'm sorry about that. We’ll make... we'll make sure we read the rules next time. See that you do. What an ass. You’d think I was selling crack by the pool. Hey, you didn’t drink all the liquor, did you? No. Okay. Well, fix me a drink. I’m gonna take a shower. Well, what do you want? Scotch. How do you want it? What? How do you want it? Your wild side’s starting to show, Mr. Video store man. Your scotch. How do you want it? Straight up. That felt great. That was my first shower in two years without a whole bunch of chicks checking me out. - Is this mine? - Yeah. What are you watching? It’s a classic, actually. Robert mitchum plays a guy who wants to go straight. But, once you’re bad, you’re... you're bad. Do you believe that? Maybe. I, um, went to prison for running money. Yeah, I got 22 months... Because I was stupid enough to get caught. I was working as a bartender for this real prick. Harley, get over here. Who ran things with this guy named tono, a mystery guy who everybody was scared of. For a middle man, gin was pretty scary himself. What the fuck you doin’ over there? I’m cleaning up like you told me. I need you to do a run for me. Where? Take this over to mort’s mortuary. A guy named Lenny will be waiting for you. And, I counted it all myself, so don’t get creative on me. That’s how I fell into running money. Hey, when are you sending big Tommy with my fucking cash? - He’s right here, boss. - What the fuck’s that? It’s big Tommy. He didn’t make it out of the hearse. He was supposed to be in Vegas three days ago. Now, if you have to drive up there yourself, I don’t care. Just get that cash to tono. We’ll need gas. No, that’s all right. I’ll get it... Somehow. So my boss has this elaborate system set up. I take the clean cash to the morgue where gin had this guy Lenny working for him. Lenny would hide the money in a safe place, then gin would ship it to Vegas without ever getting caught. That’s when Lenny came up with this big plan. I got like $6 million a month going through that morgue. Nobody’s gonna notice a little bit here and there. But I need you, Harley. Yeah, yeah. All right, what do I do? You don’t do nothin'. That’s the sweetest thing. You just deliver the money like nothin’ ever happened. Not gonna get caught, right? We’re not gonna get caught. Just remember the plan, baby. Pura vida. Pura vida. Our deal was simple: After Lenny skimmed the money, i’d drop it off. Nobody ever seemed to question where a few bucks went here and there. And then every week, Charlie and Virginia friendly... Would make a visit to the safe deposit box. We’d take the money we were skimming from gin and tuck it away for safekeeping. I mean, who would ever look in a bank for money? Thing is, gin never even seemed to notice. It looked like Lenny had come up with the perfect plan... And we were about to live happily ever after. Till lenny’s launderer friend got busted, rolled over... And turned Lenny into the feds. Put the a.R. On the front door of the cabin. Lenny. Can you hear that? What? Come out with your hands up. We have the cabin surrounded. What the fuck are we gonna do? I don’t know. Lenny. Gun! That was the end of Lenny. You tell a heck of a story. I spent two years upstate. Didn’t your boss ever figure out that you were stealing from him? Yeah. I mean, probably after I got put away. What ever happened to the money? It’s still in the safe deposit box. And I just happen to have... both keys. It’s just sitting there waiting... For Charlie and Virginia friendly to come and get it. Now all I need is a Charles friendly. Where are you gonna find him? Me? Yeah. It’s... It’ll be so easy. It’ll be 15 minutes of your life. I mean, you don’t want to wind up like that guy in the movie, do you, ray? I mean... We can go to some tropical island. Like Costa Rica. You know what their motto is? Their motto is "pura vida." The pure life. We could just change our lives. That money could be our chance. Yeah. That’s nice. Can I help you? What can I do for you? I need a room. Fill that out. Sixty bucks. I’m supposed to meet some friends of mine here. The guy’s about my height. Wife’s about, about that big. Good looker, pretty hair. She’s kind of... brazen. She’s... socially offensive. That’s her. Your face. Rodeo. Bullshit. Wife slap you around? Well, somethin’ like that. I’ll give you the room next to theirs. I wouldn’t give it to anybody else. That’ll work fine. Sell the aspirin? No. Must be the best hotel in town. It’s the only hotel in town. Well, I guess you get all the business then, don’t you? Lucky me. 216. Up the stairs, back of the hallway. I go to bed at 11:00. Plunger in every room. Don’t call. Pleasant dreams. What’s with the clientele? Nope. They haven’t gone anywhere. I just got here. Right. I’ll let you know when anything happens. So you think you can get a clean slate... Just by packing off for the tropics? Well, it’s a start. I mean, after this, no more lying, no more stealing. And if anyone even looks crooked, i’m not gonna touch 'em with a ten-foot pole. Well, there’s something to be said about lookin’ someone in the eye... And telling them the truth. So... Fifty/fifty. A million each. Do I look like him? You’re cuter. I can’t believe you guys wore these things. Yeah, what can I say? Lenny thought it made him look sophisticated. Yeah, well, he’d look like a tablecloth. I knew you had a sense of humor in there somewhere. Gettin’ nervous? No. I, am just tellin’ a little fib, right? Right. Ray, you ever see the movie? Yeah. Jeremy irons was great in that. No, no, no. Not that one. The classic. The one with Bette Davis. You know the one where she burns her writing hand with the hot poker... So she could forge her sister’s signature? Don’t worry. I'm not gonna burn your hand off. But we need to get our stories straight, okay? I’m thinking... Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Next. Well, good morning to you. Hi. What can we do for you today on this beautiful day? We wanted to get into our safety deposit box. Well, we could take care of that right now, lickety-split. What’s your name, dears? Friendly. Charles and Virginia. What a happy name! Gosh, we haven’t seen you in a long time! All righty. If I can get you both just to sign right here. Well, it’s not a problem for me, but, Mr. Friendly here... Good lordy, what happened? Skiing accident. Well, you just go ahead and do your very best to sign with your good hand. Of course i’ll have to see photo I.D. From both. Well. Super-duper. Come on back. Don, would you mind giving these nice folks a hand? Is that you, Mrs. Friendly? Sure is. I just figured you closed out the box. They’ve been traveling. Really? Where you been, Mr. Friendly? All over, Don. Mr. Friendly? Don, have you been lifting weights? I sure have, Mrs. Friendly. I knew it. It’s so sweet of you to notice. Okay. You know what color he’d look really handsome in... Don, Don, there they go. Wait a second. Wait a second. They’re going. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop. Mr. Friendly. You forgot your I.D. See you around, Don. Okay. Say, Jimmy, who was that man with Mrs. Friendly? Why, that was Mr. Friendly, of course. That’s not Mr. Friendly. I can’t believe it. We did it. Cheers. Good-bye to the friendlys. May they rest in peace. May they rest in peace. I’m gonna go get this off. Okay.

You know, gin, i’ve been giving you chance after chance, and you disappoint me every time. No more chances, gin. Please, tono. I-I-I’m begging you. Please. I’ll do anything you want. Just... don’t kill me? I’m not gonna kill you, gin. I got a better way of takin’ care of you. Priceless. Let me tell you guys something, man. Everybody, I wanna talk to you a little bit about me and my friend here. Pez. Say hello, pez. Hey. Me and my friend pez, we’re gonna rule the world, you know? I gotta make a call. You are gonna get a spanking for not calling back sooner. Are you smoking in the store right now? Fuck! The correct greeting is, "this is viva las video. Pez speaking. How may I help you?" Sorry, man. I thought you were the pizza guy calling back. The what? Nothing, man. Just been a slow day. So what’s up? Listen, I got a proposition for you. How would you like to own viva las video, free of charge? What are you, crazy, man? What happened to those big-time buyers? Well, things didn’t work out so well with them. As a matter of fact, they’re a little pissed off at me right now. If anyone comes asking for me at the store, I want you to tell them... That I sold the store to you. And I moved to Canada. - Got it, man. - All right. So it’s yours, free of charge. You are kidding me. No, i’m not. But I want you to do me one favor. Name it!! I want you to get out of town for a couple of days... Until I finish up this business with these guys. All right, man. This is no problem. All right. I’ll see you around, pez. Hey, ray. You take care of yourself, okay? I know what you did. You know I went back for the bag... And it was filled with paper. I’m just trying to figure out how you did it. How I switched the money? Magic. So, um... Where is the money? Well, if you had the money, then why’d you come back? You. What the fuck is this? Looks like it’s all here. Good job, ray. No problem, Mr. Tono. You just keep to straight and narrow, you’ll be fine. You ever change your mind about that dead-end job you’re in, you can always come back and work for me. I’m gonna need someone to run things instead of gin. Come here. I want you to meet somebody. Consider yourself lucky, young lady. If it wasn’t for ray here, you’d still be in that cabin with that dirtbag Lenny. Yeah. I knew everything from day one. Just had to let things play out a little bit and... Then make ’em right.
