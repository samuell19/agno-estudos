( water running ) Go on, get out of here. Find yourself a decent home. Don't rely on me coming home every night. It's not gonna happen. Go on. You didn't ask for this either. Take a look at these figures. What is this bitch up to? She's not turning enough tricks. What's her problem? Too old or too fucking lazy? Charlie, you and Lena better get back to the club and stash that money. And you, pull yourself together. It ain't good for business. Get her out of here. Want a drink? Not for me. Nick give you that? Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing. Not doing enough business? He's gonna do that one time too many and somebody's gonna stick it to him. I wish. And then some. Come on. Ain't got all night. ( engine starts ) ( gunshots ) Stay put and watch the money in the back. ( tires squeal ) ( siren blaring ) ( radio chatter ) ( bell dings ) Evening, ma'am. Can I help you? Fill it up, please. Sure. Give me a map, too. Continental US is all we got. Mexico. You bastard. ( grunts ) ( pounding ) Man: Come out of there, bitch! Think you could get away, did you? Thought you could get away. Did you? Think you can run off with that faggot and lock me out? Who the hell are you? You stupid load of chickenshit. You got the wrong room. You drunken bum. Get out of here before I call the cops. ( siren blaring ) I want that two-timing bitch. I'm telling you, Nick, she ain't gonna get far. Not if I have anything to do with it. I'll put the word out. I know where her head's at. Don't forget, I've been around her a long time. I'll find her. Well, up till now, Charlie, your record ain't been so good. Yeah, leaving that money with Lena was pretty stupid. So what did you expect me to do? I thought you guys was getting shot at. Ma'am, this is a nice car we have here. Look, I'm in a hurry. How much is it? Very comfortable. Beautiful upholstery. So how much is it? Well, we got 3,000 bucks. Good. Step into the office. Oh, yeah. I think you're gonna like this. I think you made the right decision. Sorry, cowboy. Nick: Tell me where she is. Marlene: I don't know. Get over here. If I find out you're lying to me, I will cut you so bad no man will ever look at you again. Nobody... nobody steals even a breath from Nick Moretti. Capisce? I wouldn't lie to you, Nick. She never contacted me. I don't owe her nothing. If Charlie says he'll see to it... he will. Yeah. But Charlie's taking just a little bit too long. Pretty soon, I'm gonna figure he's made one big mistake. ( bell dings ) You want a refill? No? Okay. ( thunder rumbles ) Looks like it's gonna rain. Could be a dirty night out there. Thank you. You're welcome. Whoa. It's working up to something out there. ( horn honks ) There you go, Sheryl Anne. Sounds like Lenny. Oh, okay. I'd better get out there. That truck of his is sounding pretty rough. Why don't you have him bring it in? I'll look it over. Okay. I won't charge him. You don't want him breaking down on the way to the hospital. Having the kid in the back of the truck. Okay. Thanks, Eddie. I see the price of gas is going up again, Eddie. That sure ain't gonna help your business. Nobody buys gas here anymore. Not even Elvin buys gas at those old pumps we got. The only reason Elvin comes in here is to get away from his old lady. Damn right I do. At least you can cook. Do you think maybe I could get some service here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you'd been taken care of. What can I get for you? I'm gonna have the steak. Rare with a baked potato and sour cream. Sure. Anything after that? No. All right. See you tomorrow, Eddie. Yeah, bye, guys. Bye, Harvey. Give my love to Vi. ( door slams ) God. Gonna be one heck of a night out there. Sure could use a break in the weather. I guess. The rain like this always brings the heat. Makes your blood rise, huh? And it breaks up the boredom. Gives you something to complain about. ( thunder rumbles ) Here you go. Mmm. Looks pretty good. ( chuckles ) If there's anything else I can get for you... So where the heck are you going on a night like this? How is it? I'm impressed. Oh, that's good. That's good. Tastes better than it looks? You want to join me? Seems kind of silly you sitting over there and me sitting over here and us talking across the room. Sure. Be a pleasure. No remarks about the bruise, okay? No, I just... oh, what? The... all right. It's nice to have company. Nobody comes this time of night. What, since the highway was built? Yeah. How'd you know that? You're not from around here. Um... just logical. You said "us." Anybody else live here? It seems pretty quiet. No, just me. Just me. I pump the gas. I fix a few cars. Sheryl Anne helps out, but she got herself knocked up. So she won't be coming in anymore. Maybe I'll just switch off the pumps and cook. I like to cook. ( thunder cracks ) You want some music? Drown out the thunder? Yeah. Why not? Sure. You like opera? My parents were Italian. They played this to me all the time when I was a kid. You from back East? Yeah. You want a beer? No, thanks. Something stronger? Bourbon? That would be fine. A large one. Sure. ( opera playing ) My name's Eddie. Eddie Brusso. Lena. Just Lena? Yeah. Just Lena. No. Here's to Lena. Feel free. It's on the house. Thanks. Your folks, they still alive? Yes and no. My mother died when I was 10 trying to have my kid brother. Was never the same after that. You know, it's... my father, he couldn't cope. Just couldn't cope. So he started boozing. We drifted apart. I've been there. ( thunder rumbles ) Oh, come on. You can't go anyplace tonight. Why don't you just sleep on the couch? I'll get you some blankets. You'll be okay. You've been drinking. You know you can't drive. Forget it, Eddie. I'm fine. I'd better go. Go where? Listen, how much do I owe you? I told you, it's on the house. Thanks. I enjoyed it. It's real nice being with you, Lena. And out you go. ( engine starts ) ( whirring ) Fuck! ( knocking ) Sheesh. What happened? I couldn't get the hood up. I guess it's busted. God, you'd better get out of these wet clothes. ( laughs ) I could use a hot shower. Yeah, sure. It's the first door on your left, top of the stairs. That's quite a talent you got there, Frank. You got to stay sharp. What do you think Nick will do when he catches up with her? What do you think? He's got no choice. What do you mean? Listen, Marlene, you don't make a move like that if you haven't reckoned the odds. Ah, so you got to take the good with the bad, huh? Whatever. I mean, that's the way you see it, right? That's the law. ( motorcycle approaching ) Hey, how are you? Need any gas? Nah. Just come by to see what's shaking with you. Oh? Nice car you got over there. Yeah. That yours? Hi. You want some breakfast? Yeah. Sheryl Anne. You want the special? Yeah. Coming right up. Your car took a real soaking last night. I looked at the top. It ain't busted. There's a part missing. You didn't notice? I just bought the car. I haven't used the top yet. All right. Well, you know, I can fix it, but it might take a while. What are you telling me? Here you go. Thanks, Sheryl Anne. You're welcome. Want cream? Coffee smells good. So, what? You just drifting? Yeah. Heading towards Mexico. Well, your car is pointed in the right direction, but you got a hell of a way to go, though. You speak Spanish? No. So what the hell are you going to Mexico for? You running away from your old man? I'm not married, Eddie. You ever been married? Ha. Well, came close once. It's... ( laughs ) So how come you ended up here? Well, I never did like it in the city. And I was in 'Nam. You know, and, uh... God, it was... it was so beautiful. Really. So quiet sometimes, you know, when the fires from hell weren't all over it. So I... I found me this green place. God, you're pretty. So, you want to ride with me into Bilton? I ordered the part. Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? Listen. ( motor starts ) Hi, Brad. Do you have the part? Oh, I'll probably have it for you by tomorrow. Want me to check on it? Oh, well, there's no rush. Huh? Hi, Chuck. This is Deputy Sheriff Chuck Dalton. Real pleased to meet you, ma'am. It's not often we see a pretty lady such as yourself down here in Bilton. You from around these parts? No. Sorry, ma'am. I didn't quite catch your name. That's 'cause I didn't throw it. Lena. Lena Fisher. Mighty pretty. So you gonna be around here for a little while? Eddie's gonna fix my car. Then I'm moving on. Oh, well, then that must have been your white convertible I saw down at Eddie's garage. I wondered who that belonged to. Well, now you know. It's the policeman in me, I guess. Well, real pleased to meet you, ma'am. You take care now. Eddie. See you around. So... this is why I left New York. I ain't going back. Can't figure you out, Eddie. You seem to be searching for something. No, I... I'm just... I just want to make things go right, you know? I want to forget the past. I just want it right back there, you know? Yeah. A few years back, I got in some trouble. Came out of the army and me and a couple of guys, we stole a car. Driving around like crazy. Drank a lot of liquor. We held up a store. I knew it was wrong. But... it gave you a high. It felt good. We beat up the store guy pretty bad. Stupid, huh? Yeah, stupid. Anyway, we got caught and I did time. ( chuckles ) You never know what's gonna happen to you next, huh? Right? Well, all I know is out here right now, alone, seems like nothing ever happened to either of us before. You know, Lena... you make me feel right. You know? You make me feel good. I never felt like this, you know, in a long time. ( thunder rumbling ) ( water turns off ) I got a lucky break, Nick. Stupid bitch went and bought herself a white Cadillac. I'm out in the middle of nowhere, some godforsaken hole. Sales guy here says he remembers her because she was a real looker. Listen to me good, Charlie. Next time you call, I only want to hear that you know where she's hanging out. You got that? I thought this might help. The white convertible she bought was gonna be our car of the month. You know, we always put up a flyer for sales promotion. All right. Don't make the same mistake twice. You got taken before. Don't let it happen again. It ain't worth it. You worry too much. I'll be okay. Look, what you need is somebody with some roots. Someone's who's gonna stick around and not take off on you again. Trust me, Eddie. You ain't as young as you were. You can get really hurt. And there ain't no sense in that just to prove to yourself you can still do it. Hey, I know I can still do it. What are you talking about? It's nice you care. Thanks. That's real nice. Just don't get yourself into something you can't handle. All right. Just... ( horn honks ) All right. I'm off to the clinic, then. All right. See you tomorrow. Don't forget the eggs. I won't. Want some help? Want to make some fresh coffee? Sure. ( music playing ) So, did you fix my car? I fixed it. Maybe you should put some gas in it, then. So you're leaving? I guess so. Well, I kinda hoped you might hang around a while. Well, I got to admit, I am kinda getting to like it here. Hi, Chuck. Eddie. What can we do for you? Think I might have me a cup of coffee. Sure. What's up? It ain't normal seeing you here twice in one week. Oh, well, I've come by to see this pretty lady right over here. I drove past and saw her car was still out front. Well, it's always a pleasure to see you, Sheriff. So what's new? Not a lot. I see you like jazz. Yeah, you could say that. Eddie's thinking about closing down early today. Don't be long, honey. That's one heck of a woman you got there, Eddie. You ever need any help with her, you just give me a call, okay? I don't need no help. What the hell is the matter with everybody today? ( dogs barking ) ( opera playing ) Tell me something. What do you remember that was good? First time my old man took me to a baseball game. The first time, the only time, he took me to the opera. And, you know, both those places, there was... there was the same feeling. Something was gonna happen. And when it did, the people that were doing it, they knew they was doing something big. I'm glad you got something good to remember. Mine's just a blank. Or maybe I just don't want to see it. Sounds good, Eddie. Don't ever lose that. You know, Lena, we get on good, huh? Why don't you shack up here for a while? Listen, it doesn't have to be a life commitment or anything. Sheryl Anne's about to drop and I could do with some help around here. Thanks, but I can't. Why not? I just can't. I have to move on. Sure. No, listen, I understand. Tell you something, Lena... I can't get enough of you. I can't leave you alone. I just... ( thunder rumbles ) It's me. I found her, Nick. She's laying low in some poky, two-bit diner called Eddie's. Just outside some hick town near Bilton. Don't tell her I know where she is. She'd panic. We're gonna be late for the club. And don't rush it. Just make sure you do it right. I want to see that money again. All of it. Nick, I'll handle it. 32-year-old Gary Evans was described by neighbors as a quiet man who kept largely to himself. Tuesday's tragedy... You're one crazy lady, Lena, to steal from Nick Moretti. That was a dumb fucking thing to do. I like your hair. Why don't you pour me a cup of that nice coffee you got? Making for the border, are we? Now what's Nick gonna say when I make the call to him and tell him that I found you? I always had the hots for you, Lena. Maybe we could work something out, Charlie. What did you have in mind? I don't know. That's a dumb fucking thing to say, Lena. You ain't gonna get far on "I don't know." So is it here? Yeah, Charlie, it's here. First time out, you made me look real stupid, Lena. This time, you ain't gonna get away with it. Ahh! ( screaming ) ( register rings ) ( screams ) It's all right. Lena, Jesus. Are you okay? ( groans ) Bastard. Hey. He's fucking dead. ( scoffs ) I didn't mean to hit him that hard. I didn't mean to kill him. ( spits ) Oh, Jesus Christ. I've got to call Chuck down. Oh, no, no. Hey, what are you doing? No. What do you mean, no? Eddie, no. Hey, did you know who this guy is? If you know who this guy is, you'd better tell me. We've got to dump this guy. Hey, wait a second. This was an accident. What are you talking about? Who the fuck is he? His name is Charlie. He's a two-bit hoodlum who works for Nick Moretti who runs the rackets outside of Pittsburgh. So what's that got to do with you? Oh, Jesus. What? This is hard enough. Would you just let me say what I want to say? You don't just dump a guy. For Christ's sake, will you just listen to me for a second? I used to work for Nick Moretti. I worked in his club. I was trapped. He was always beating me up. Nick loves to slap people around. Hey. Ah! That's just a sample! I've never done anything like that and you know it. I just front the club and handle the customers. I don't even touch the money or make the count. This better be the truth, sweetheart. He had just done this job. Charlie was gonna stash a lot of money. Charlie always did that for Nick. Nick trusted Charlie. And I used to go with him on the trip. Charlie and me were getting into this car in the alley to go and there was all this shooting, and so he runs back in to see if Nick's okay. I just did it. I drove off with the money. And then I realized there was no turning back. I still got the money. But we got to dump Charlie. But if this guy found you, so can what's his name, Nick. No, 'cause Charlie said he didn't talk to him yet. So Nick doesn't know where I am. You can't just dump a body. It ain't that simple. Look, if we don't dump the body, who's to say they'd believe you if you told them it was an accident? You said yourself you'd done some time. They'll put you away for good. There's no getting out of it, no matter what you say. Not with the mob. And this is a small town. The news, it'll spread like... it'll be the biggest thing that happened here ever. Eddie, please. Please don't call the police. Please. If you're right, I'm, you know, finished. Oh, Lena. Oh, Jesus, Lena. What are you doing? Thank you. ( thunder rumbles ) ( grunts ) You said you wanted me to stick around. You still feel the same? You know I do. What's done is done, Lena. You didn't want that to happen. Let's give it a try for a while. That makes sense. Till I get straight, huh? You're real special, Lena. I could really feel something for you. Lena: When I was a kid, I used to lie there staring into space thinking about where I'd be one day. You only caught one fish? No, two. Where's the other one? Its eyes were bulging. It was gasping. So I put it back in the water. Swam free. I don't know. Probably died of fright. ( laughs ) I wish we could stay here. Forever. Just let the world go by. You're dreaming, Eddie. But I guess there's nothing wrong with that as long as you're happy. Got to dream once in a while, you know? Like those home runs, belting the ball into the sky. Or making the plays. Doing something with your life. If that's all you need, Eddie, you're one lucky guy. Rrr. ( shrieks ) ( laughs ) I could eat you all over. All over. Hi, Chuck. Eddie. Ma'am. Quite a storm we had the other night, wasn't it? It sure was. I drove by here, I saw your lights was out. I guess you must have closed early or something, huh? ( bell dings ) What does a girl like you do on a night like that anyway? Wouldn't you like to know? I guess I never will, will I? Sure could use a cup of coffee, though. He's like a bad penny that keeps showing up. He's not a problem. He gets bored, you know, cruising around all day. Yeah? Well, why does he keep coming around? You said yourself he never used to. Just be careful what you say. Don't take any chances. I don't know. Listen. Maybe we ought to get rid of your car. Maybe I ought to do a quick spray job. Couple days, I'll take it down to Mexico. Come on, come on. He ain't got nothing on us. Charlie found her. Said he needed a few days to sort things out. She's hiding out down South with some guy in a diner. Who the fuck did she think she was dealing with? That money is coming back here. ( snaps fingers ) I ain't waiting for Charlie any longer. Something ain't right. I don't know what it is, but I'm gonna fix it. I'll help you. Just tell me what you want done. ( door opens ) You got a room? You could say that. I'll take it. It's $35. Taking it for more than one night? Mm-hmm. Gas station and diner down the road. I reckon it's closed by now, though. You want a stack or half a stack? Harvey: Half a stack. Saw Sheryl Anne's old man this morning driving like his tail was on fire. Guess she's just about ready to drop. Guess so. Morning. So what'll it be? I'll have eggs scrambled with a side of buckwheat, please. Give me a light, will you? I guess you're a local, right? Sure thing. But I can see you're not. That's right. What you doing in these parts? Just passing through? I'm scouting for real estate. Heard there's some cheap land hereabouts. Ha. I'd sure like to find it. So who owns this joint? Eddie Brusso. So who wants to know? You Mrs. Eddie? In a manner of speaking. You don't wear a ring. I don't have a need to. Name's Tad. Tad Mulshaw. Lena. Nice to meet you. Don't sound like you come from around here. You sound more like a city girl. So what's it to you? I was just interested. Of course, bet you Eddie's a real local, though. This place looks like it's been around for a while. Yeah. He knows his way around town. How'd you meet? Came off the highway. Stopped in the rain one night and he had some food. So you're here buying land, but you're just passing through? This isn't the kind of place you just pass through. You have to come off the highway to get down here. Well, I heard a friend of mine was out this way. He's kind of like the competition. You know what I mean? Thought I'd track him down. Seen any strangers around? No, I haven't. Well, I guess I'll catch up with him. Well, we don't get many strangers here. They just stick out like a rose in the desert. Where are you staying? Roadside hotel couple miles down the road. It's run by some strange guy who spends most of his time fixing clocks. Sounds like you could get a bit lonely. So, we gonna be seeing you again? Yeah, maybe I'll hang around for a few days. Who knows, maybe I'll come across my friend. You know where to find me if you need me. I'll bear it in mind. This Eddie, you and him been going together long? You don't seem like the type of girl to hang around a place like this permanent. Figured it out, have you? Well, ain't natural to keep a flower in the shade. Otherwise, it'll wither up and die. Well, don't worry about me. I'll blossom whenever and wherever I'm ready. You know something? I like you. I can see you can make a guy feel real good. Is that so? Mm-hmm. I ain't been close to a woman like you in a long time. If you ever get lonely... So, you're gonna buy some land, then what you gonna do? I got to go. You're just gonna sit on it until you make a good killing? Yeah. Nothing like a good killing. I guess I'll be seeing you then. Bye, Lena. ( machinery chugging ) ( door creaks ) What can I do for you? Yeah, it's the timing on my car. It's off. I thought you might take a look at it. All right. Is it out front? Yeah. All right. Go on. I don't want any dust in here. Well, it's a bit off, but not a lot. It's a real nice convertible back there. Is it for sale? No, it ain't mine. ( engine revs ) It's a 1970, isn't it? Yeah. It looks like it's in great condition. Yeah. Why you spraying it? You from an insurance company or what? No. Sure asking a lot of questions. I never knew a guy who asked so many questions. It just ain't normal. He's a cop. He says he's in real estate, but he smells like a cop. And packs a gun. You're right, you know. You're right. He's sniffing at something. He won't stop. Maybe he is onto something. But nobody knows Charlie's dead, so he's just cat and mousing us. He's probably trailing Charlie to track the mob. He's got bits and pieces and he's trying to put them all together. Trouble is, everything ends up here. He's a threat to us. He's a goddamn fucking threat. ( phone ringing ) Yes? I want to speak with Lena. Yeah, this is Lena. Tad Mulshaw. I figured it must have been you that left a message for me last night. Well, you figured right. So what do you have to tell me about my friend? Well, I don't think we should talk about it on the phone. No? Well, maybe we should meet. Yeah, I had something like that in mind. I was beginning to think about what you said. I was getting a little lonely. Well, I don't mind mixing a little business with pleasure. Well, so why don't you come over? Don't you think Eddie might have something to to say about this? Eddie doesn't have to know. He's out of town. I'm gonna close the diner around 10:00 tonight. Use the back door. ( exhales ) Aah. Appreciate the invitation. Well, you said to get in touch, you know, if I had any information about your friend. Well, looks like it's my lucky day all around. Would you like a drink? Yeah, I'd like a drink. Bourbon? Bourbon. Happy hunting. That's what I do best. Aah. This heat is so heavy tonight. Makes me feel damp all over. Makes me feel tense. All I want to do is sponge myself off, relax, and breathe a bit easier. I don't like being alone. When I was a kid, I used to lie awake wishing it would get light out so I didn't feel so crushed in. In my line of business, you spend a lot of time travelling on your own. Always on the search. Where are you heading, Tad? Seems like neither of us could feel good in one place for too long. You don't have to be alone tonight if you don't want to. Let's have another drink. I can see tonight is going to be a long night. I hope so. I feel so wet. Did you know that when the female frog allows the male frog to mount her, she clamps on so tight they can't get off and then she rides him to death? Are you threatening me, or is that a promise? Let's not rush it. It's not light out for a while yet. You're pretty cool. You know what you want and know you're gonna get it. There ain't nothing that's gonna stop you. It's the chase, Tad. You've got to pace yourself and then strike when you're ready. Bottoms up. And here's to the finish line. It's a beautiful night. Let's get some fresh air. We can take a spin in my car. The top's down. Let the wind blow in our hair. Then you can bring me back and fuck me. Come on, let's get out of here. The keys are in the car. Why don't you back it up? All right. ( engine starts ) What? What's going on? Open the door. Hey! Open the door! Shit. ( straining ) Lena, open the door. Open the goddamn door! What's going on? Open the goddamn door! Come on! Open the door. You're killing me! Open the fucking door! Open the door! Lena, let me out! Lena! ( coughing ) Help me! Help! Let me out! I can't stand this. We can't do this. This ain't right. We got to let him out. It's too late. He knows we're trying to kill him. There's no turning back. We can't stop. Give me the key. Lena, give me the key. Give me the fucking key! Forget it. We are going through with this right to the end. Lena, we can't do this. We're not killers. Lena, why? Why? Open the door, Lena. Ah! ( coughs ) ( shouts ) ( coughing ) ( horn blaring ) Get him off that horn, Eddie, now. ( Eddie coughing ) ( horn stops ) Oh, Jesus. Can't breathe anything. Goddamn. ( engine stops ) ( both coughing ) ( clock ticking ) ( phone rings ) Yeah? Mulshaw. He's got a room here, yeah. Just hold on a second. Yeah. Shoot. Ugh. Oh, Jesus. What's the matter? Jesus. He's not a cop. He's not a cop. We fucked up. We really fucked up. What are you talking about? If he's not a cop, who is he? He's a fucking highway surveyor. He buys land so he can build highways. He was looking for someplace, you know, to put on an on-ramp or something. I thought he was a cop. And that wasn't a gun. Look, it wasn't a gun. It was this. We killed him for nothing, Lena. We killed him for fucking nothing. Hi. There's something going on. What is it? Listen, Eddie... Don't tell me to listen. You think I'm stupid or something? Are you trying to tell me this release bolt did not come out of your car? Huh? You took it out, didn't you? You took it out and you hid it. But you didn't hide it good enough. Were you looking for a reason to stay without me catching on? You had this whole thing planned right from the start, didn't you? Huh? What, do you think I'm some poor sucker you can just con for a while while you hide out? Huh? Nice quiet place, no one ever finds you. It's true. I was just hiding out. I didn't know I was gonna feel this way about you. Everything's different now. I need you. I want to be with you. Oh, yeah? So what about this? What about this? Huh? I'm sorry, but I went snooping. I found this in your purse. I haven't had this design printed in two years. You've been here before. Yes. I've been here before. So what? So what? I've been this way before. I was on my way south a couple years ago. So what? I remember it was really quiet here and it was like the perfect cover. And then we met and everything changed. And what difference does it make anyway? I mean, we're together. I wish... I wish I could believe you. There just seems to be something wrong here. You've got to believe me. Too much has happened to us. Just trust me. I'm not gonna let you down. Not now. You know... Lena, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. But I have to know you're on the level. I'm telling you, I want the same as you. I want us to be together. I don't have a choice here, do I? 'Cause I don't want to lose you. So, I'm just... Hey, Al. I got your message. What's up? Thanks for coming over. I got something a bit strange I couldn't figure out. So I thought you'd be the guy to talk to. What is it? Well, a few days ago, this guy turns up late one night and wants a room, see. He pays in advance, but then he leaves his shaving gear in the room and never comes back for it. Uh-huh. Now, I figure, you know, probably moved on, couldn't be bothered with it. I wouldn't even notice normally, but the strange thing is he left a watch with me to fix. He said his wife had given it to him. It's got writing inside. "To my beloved husband" and everything like that. So I'm thinking, mighty strange. Why? Why would a guy leave me something like that and never bother to come back for it? Well, he said he would be going off for a couple hours that night. So it leaves me thinking what's going on? What was his name? Mulshaw. Tad Mulshaw. I never did ask him what he was doing in these parts. Well, I got to say, it don't seem right to me, Al. But you never know, huh? So many strange people coming around these days. Don't do to trust nobody. Yeah. Never know what they're up to, huh? Yeah. Now, did he say where he was going that night? I think he said he was going down to the diner. I don't know. It was kind of late. It's usually closed by then. ( opera playing ) ( phone ringing ) So how's your ma these days, Nick? Oh, not too bad. Her eyesight's a bit dodgy. Still, what can you expect? She's 80. But, you know, she don't want for nothing. You Mr. Casselia? So? There's a call for you. Oh, yeah? It's out the back on the wall. Come on, kid. I ain't got all day here. Bring me one of them hot towels. So where's Emilio today? He's gone to his goddaughter's wedding, Mr. Moretti. I ain't too good with strangers. Bring it over here. Better not be too hot or I'll have your fingers broken. Relax, kid. I'm only kidding you. ( sighs ) Oh, come on, kid. Get on with it. I ain't got all day here. ( turns up volume ) ( groans ) ( gasping ) ( clucking ) ( bell dings ) Fill it right up. Yeah, sure. Want me to check the oil? Yeah. Driven a long way. Your oil's okay. So let's see, that's 24 bucks. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll get your change. Beautiful day, huh? Yeah, real nice. ( register rings ) $26. Thank you very much. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus. Oh. Hey. ( gasping ) Sure looking good, kid. Lena: God. I missed you, Frank. What took you so long? I was beginning to think you weren't gonna make it. Sure wasn't easy trying to waste a guy like Nick. It's a pity about Eddie, though. I wish you could have let him go. Couldn't. He knew too much. There's no other way. ( laughs ) I was kinda getting to like him. Yeah? Right. We fooled them good, Frank. Even that son of a bitch Charlie, so predictable. All that shooting in the alley sure drew him away. We did it good. You were great. We're here. Pull in through there. It's a nice spot. Can't be seen from the road. You take the money, Frank, and put it in the trunk. It'll be safe there. ( gunshot ) Pretty neat, huh? Mmm, I'll say. Think we're gonna make it? I didn't wait all this time to be disappointed now. ( sniffs ) ( engine starts ) So, how was it? Oh, for a while back there, just for a moment, I thought I was beginning to understand. I kind of had a sense of who I was or who I might have been. I guess it's written, right? There's no changing that. Yeah. That's for sure. Mexico? Mexico.
