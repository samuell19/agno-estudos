I gotta take a whiz but you just lay there and think about how cute you think I am. -Okay. -Ready? Break. [Drew grunts] [punk music plays in distance] [chuckles] Don't mind me first mate, Squawkers. Just make sure he doesn't bite you. [laughing] Are we gonna get scurvy? That's not the worst disease you contracted. -Fuck you. -Fuck me? No ma'am, fuck you. Land ho, ladies. -Excuse me, driver? -Captain. Captain, sorry, um, could you please take us to the roundabout up there and swing back around please? [Captain] What do you think? Aye-aye. Hard starboard. Isn't that your parents? Fuck. Well, no need to jump ship. What could they possibly want? Well, you've been screening their calls, right? Well, yeah, but-- Yeah, okay. So, we can do this. All we need to do is conceal the fact that you're a drunkard now. I can't go in there with pre-spilled wine on my dress. I have some female clothes in the boot. Would you like to borrow them? What? I have some clothes in the boot. Would you like them, Skye? How does he know my name? Yes, she would. Thank you, Captain. -How does he know my name? -[shushing] Just let it happen. [boot creaks open] Yeah. She was about your size. Aloha. Huh. [Drew mumbling] Oh, hey, you know Casey, don't you? Did she come by here looking extremely aroused? Uh, she didn't tell you? She just got a phone call saying that her entire family had been killed in a horrific car accident and she had to leave immediately. Huh. I am sad for multiple reasons. The car crash is none of them, really. [Skye] I cannot believe they're here. Mr. and Mrs. Baker. So nice to see you again here at my home. You're looking great. Have you lost weight? Cram it, Hooper. Did he just last name me? Yeah, everything's great. Keeping busy. That's what you wanted to hear, right? Look, we're just-- we just want to know how you're doing. We don't understand why you broke up with this guy. He was so sweet to you, so nice to you. We just don't get it, Skye. Look, I'm sorry I haven't been speaking to you guys. I've just been going through some things and I needed some time to figure it all out. I'll-- I'll call you after I've sorted things through. I know you think I made a mistake by breaking up with him... but... I didn't. Maybe we can talk about it over brunch? Don't be stupid, Skye. You know perfectly well your mother and I don't do brunch. It's breakfast or lunch. Choose one. [rock music plays in distance] ♪ [car door slams shut] [bottle breaks] [chuckles] And that's why my plan is infallible. So, what are you going to do when Jacob shows up? He'll be too busy trying to climb out of his own asshole before he gets here. A couple of hours. Fuck. Hey, guys, it's your boy. What's up, man? No, it's not your boy. What the fuck is this? An absolute banger of a party, bro. Grab a drink. Dude, how is there a party going on right now? How and why? Well, if you must know, Jacob, since you rudely ditched me at the bar, I had to find my own way back home and the only way to do that was to hijack a party bus that just happened to roll by. It was fate, Jacob. Fate. But naturally, you know, the party went from the bus back to the house. 'Cause this is your house though, this is all-- all this is your fault. Not really mine. Shame on you, buddy. Shame. Goddammit, dude. Anyways, how'd it go with Olivia? -Not well. -Not well, he says. She has a boyfriend now. Well, it's been two years. I mean, she would be mental if she didn't move on after that. I mean, what, she's gonna be single after two years, moping around? Oh, I'm so sad, oh, I can't move on. What? Oh, oh, tell me you don't-- Sorry. No, no, no, I didn't-- -I didn't mean to-- Okay. -[Jacob] Prick. You did this to yourself, man. How the fuck did I do this to myself, Mikey? What, you came up here, you drudged up all of these old feelings again. You absolutely did this to yourself. Like, no one told you to go and talk to her again, man. Should have just hidden or run away like a normal ex-boyfriend. Fuck, you spent so long trying to get over her. What, you're gonna go back to that again? Fuck that. This is a party. There are girls. One, two. One, two. Come on, man, I'm doing you a favor here. A favor? You call this-- My Grandpa's house is gonna be trashed by the end of the night, Mikey. How is that a favor, you selfish fuck? Selfish? [snaps fingers] [sighs] Clearly, you're acting a little bit more sensitive than usual. I'm sensing a lot of negative energy here, man. Don't pretend that you're mad about this party. You're mad that she didn't go back to you. Are you surprised that "date" didn't go well? Of course it didn't. It's your ex fucking girlfriend, man. -Don't be a dumb cunt. -Don't make this about Olivia. Uh, you made this about Olivia. Already one look at her and you're back to where you were two years ago. Look, I could understand if she dumped you. But she didn't. You dumped her. You're just gonna hurt her again. You have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, don't I, Jacob? Don't I? You weren't there for the aftermath, man. She'd call me in the middle of the night asking how I can get you guys back together, or if there was a slither of a chance to get you guys to be together again? Do you really want to go through all that again? Do you really want her to go through that again? Who gave you the right to make that decision for me? Uh, you did when you accidentally bumped into her at the bar. What? I've seen you on your phone. The check-ins. All right? Don't pretend you were here to help your family sell this house. You knew she lived here, all right? You wanted to bump into her. No, no-- Jacob. Come on, come on. All right. Okay. I wanted to see her again. Is that so bad, Mike? Yes. Unequivocally yes. No good's gonna come from this, man. I don't need you telling me how much I fucked up, okay? [scoffs] Clearly I fucking do, because you're fucking things up for yourself anyway. -All right, you know what? -What? -[Jacob] Get out. -Get out? -Get out of my house. -Where the fuck -am I meant to go? -Don't care. What do you mean you don't care? Just get out, take your party and get the fuck out. -Jacob-- -Get out, Mike. Cool. You guys, too. Get out. Out. Party's over. You guys, too. Out. Didn't you hear me? Out. -[girl retches] -Ugh. Nope. Ugh. Fuck! [crickets chirping] [knocking] [doorknob rattles] I'm "sarry." You're "sarry?" It's like an advanced form of sorry. Why didn't you tell me you were the one to break up with him? I just thought it was... easier. Easier than what? I'm sarry. I just-- I don't understand, why you couldn't tell me, like, why... you didn't feel like you could be honest with me. We're supposed to be best "fwiends." [chuckles] A higher form of friends. [laughter] I just... He was the perfect guy. And I don't know what that says about me that... I didn't want him. Well, until you figure it out... my couch will be there for you. I'll be there for you. -Aw. -[laughter] [birds chirping] Morning, sunshine. Max, I'm not in the mood for your usual cheery banter right now. Oh, don't be like that. Do you want me to make you some scramby eggs? [yawns] Sure, yes. No, it's fine, dude, don't worry about it. Wilco, Skipper. Hey, I'm here for you. [mumbled] I want some scramby eggs. [Abby] Bad sleep? Absolute worst of my life. Well, you know what always makes me feel better? The news. [reporter] Tragedy struck on the roads last night when a young woman, now known to have been under the influence of alcohol and Rohypnol, commonly used as a date rape drug, crashed into an oncoming vehicle. It is currently unknown whether the drug was administered voluntarily or if she was unaware of its ingestion. In a horrible coincidence, the other vehicle involved was filled with her entire family, including her dog and mother who only just last week was declared cancer free. There were no survivors. [officer] Drugs, drinking, and driving. The devil's threesome. When this girl was smoking her weeds earlier... she wasn't thinking about the consequences of her actions. And now her... sweet, beloved dog... Pongo... has had to pay the ultimate price. [reporter] Well, one thing is for sure. If that Rohypnol was administered by a third party, -perhaps a blonde... -[Abby sighs] ...then that person is clearly a sick, sick individual. And I feel sorry for anyone who gets in the way of what she wants. Sorry, Drew. Hey, Drew, isn't that girl your beer pong partner? No, no. Never seen her before. Just 'cause she's Asian doesn't mean they all look the same. God, Max, you're such a racist prick! I hate you so much with your deep blue eyes, you think you can just look at me like that! Well you can't, you can't! [reporter] And now a story just came from China. They have been teaching panda bears to... You gotta get over her, bro. Jesus, Abby, don't do that. -[thud] -[Jacob grunts] Mom told me you ran into her. She was at the bar. Man, look at you, stalking her. It's unhealthy to be this obsessed over someone. Yeah, I know. I just don't know what I was thinking. You know, recently, every decision I've made has just been the wrong one. Maybe Mike was right. Maybe I am a dumb cunt. You're not a dumb cunt. You obviously still love her and sometimes love just makes you do crazy things. -[whimsical music plays] -[laughter] ♪ Are you okay, Jacob? You seem pretty blue. And that's not the Jacob I know. -I'm all right, Max. -Great. Can I ask you a question, Jacob? Sure. [sighs] Do you ever feel like there's something missing from your life? -What? -You know, like, there's a big gaping black hole where your heart should be and all that's contained inside is just pain, misery, and regret. On occasion, yeah. You know I-- I haven't told you this, Jacob, but... I was a bit of a sad sack before I found Wynston... and why, I just don't know what I'd do if I lost him. And say he started seeing some other guy, boy, that'd just crush me. And that's why I don't let a single day go by where I don't tell him how much he means to me because that's what you do when you love someone. Right, Jacob? Because if you love someone you gotta tell them... because if you tell them and they don't reciprocate then that just means that they lost someone who loves them. And I know that people hurt each other in this crazy, mixed up world, but gosh darn. We just gotta decide who's worth hurting for. They are worth hurting for. -[Max] Do it, Jacob. -You're right, Wynston. Max. I know what I have to do now. Thank you. ["Loves Me So" by State Line Syndicate plays] ♪ -[car engine sputters] -Fuck!

You're smarter than this, okay? Even back then you tried to tell me what I was doing was wrong.

You know, I really tried to make things right today. For the both of us. What me and Olivia had... look, I'm not stupid. I know that eventually I'll get over her... maybe even find someone else.

Well, I don't know if you can tell, but I actually have a black eye. Oh, yeah. How'd that happen? I made the egregious error of offending... a pretty good guy. Well, he can't be that great if he punched you in the face. Well, he was baking cookies for orphans when he did it, so... This story is making me feel very conflicted. Conflicted?

Okay, okay, even playing field so far. Well, much to the dismay of my parents and literally everyone who knew us... because really he-- he's such a nice guy. Like, absurdly pleasant. Yeah, yeah, I-- I think I know the type. Yeah, well, the feeling... the feeling just wasn't there... after four years. It took me four years to admit I wasn't happy with this perfect guy... and it made me wonder, you know... what's wrong with me? Maybe you just weren't right for each other, I mean, doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. Yeah, tell that to my parents. Look, you seem okay to me. Yeah. Maybe not wrong. But different. I'm... I'm not the same person I thought I was... or who my parents hoped I was. It's taken me a long time to admit that.
