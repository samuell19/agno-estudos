We wake up ? Stop, look at me. Look at me, Avigail. Come here, sit down. It'll be OK. OK '? Can you explain to us what happened? It seems like... At eight weeks, everything was fine on the ultrasound. What could have gone wrong? Iâîirën did not go wrong, but as in any process... If we are there, it is good that something is wrong. Yes, that's what I'm trying to explain. During the embryonic period, sometimes the embryo stops developing. But Avigail has already given birth. She had a pregnancy without problems, she has a perfectly healthy daughter. It can happen, even after having a first child. that recurrent miscarriages occur. What I am suggesting this time, unlike last time, it is to carry out a curettage. What does it mean ? J-'va-iimeznais take an embryo sample to have it genetically tested. - Following curettage? - Yes. If the genetic structure... Haven't we done it already? If there is anything wrong, the next time, in addition to the treatment for fertilization, you will be offered a preimplantation genetic diagnosis. - You listen ? - Did you listen to me ', Avigail'? Do you have to do it right away? If she's bleeding tonight, we won't be able to take anything for genetic testing. Better do it right away, I'll send you to the infirmary. Despite all your pain and grief, you must continue. I'll give you a prescription. BELOVED Over here, to the right. Warning. Here is. - Shall we give you a moment? - Yes. Na'ama, it's better for him. - He's not used to being alone. - He won't be alone. We will come and see him often. Obviously. I'm not going to give it up. Dad f) He knows we're here. - How do you know ? - His lips are moving. - Only her lips? - Yes, when I touch it. I tell you he feels our presence. Touch his hand, you'll see. I know it's hard for you, but it's not possible. . , You need to understand that given its decline I don't think you, his daughters, can cope with his swallowing problems. He wouldn't want to see you cry all day had to change nursing staff constantly. By experiment, I can tell you that one is the best place for him. - We can't handle this alone. - Very well. How often does someone drop by to see him? Listen, like anything, there is a follow-up. There is a follow-up when he has a bowel movement, for example. Do you always check that he is well? Yes, we change his diapers. At what times? You go to 9 p.m., what's next? We go every two hours and we Change it if necessary... - They know what they're doing. - There's no problem. It's a good question. You will get to know us. I know you from Neta. No one would leave a loved one here without asking any questions beforehand. It's happened before, but... Na'ama, Neta is a close friend. I wouldn't have put it in a place that I don't know I don't know him and it's my right to ask questions without getting on your nerves. Its important to me. Thank you ! I don't know who I can trust here. I want clear and precise answers. What's your problem ? I will speak to you from the bottom of my heart.

Enough is enough ! Your 13-year-old daughter hasn't come home, it's 10 p.m., I'm calling: "Oh well, isn't she here?" - What if she was raped? - You're dramatizing. I dramatize? Truly? Do you want to find her dead in a trash can? You shout. - No, I'm not screaming. - I heard you. You came when I lost my temper and where I put it out. I am a police officer and I had to force this kid out. It is an assault. I could be in trouble for this. - So why did you do it? - Because I told them 10 p.m. I was on my way. You are immediately aggressive. She doesn't care what you tell her. It's like that, children, they test the limits. - We have to find a solution... - No, listen. If you want me to get involved in her life and that I take care of her, It will be on my Terms and it won't be like that anymore. It's time to give it some limits. I don't see a solution. I do not know what to do. If I give it limits, it'll pull away from me. - That's what will happen. -No. No, you're the only person she has. It's not going to be easy, but she's going to get used to it. I am tired. How is it going ? - It's us. - Great. Come in. Avigail, Yael. Welcome. - How are you ? - Well. And you, after yesterday?

No, I wanted you to explain it to him yourself. I am a midwife and I also accompany before... So you studied...? The profession of traditional midwife. I don't work in hospitals. Don't you have the diploma? I am qualified for home births. I am that type. It's not familiar to me. Jace accompanies women before birth, during and after. Yael accompanied me in the preparation before getting pregnant through a very deep process. What do you mean "before"? I couldn't get pregnant. It took a long time. We talked about it a bit. Yael made me take a journey that helped me to get pregnant and to evolve towards motherhood. And I thought to myself... that she could help you too. I told you, I think an emotional job could open something... You mean, see a psychologist? As I understand it, are you trying to get pregnant? Yes. How long can I tell him? It's been two years now. With all that that implies. I'm sorry... My beautiful, come in my arms. - No, it's okay. - Come here. My beautiful... It's okay_ Go ahead, cry. Let yourself go. It was a long day.

While relieving it, I continued to pat it. It makes her feel like she's still rocked. Alright, she's going to fall asleep soon. It's nice to hear you laugh. Have you never lay down on a pear?

Good ? It helps me take the rest, I don't know... Then I feel guilty for not being able to stop. // say what, Rashi? I hide it from him. I put that on the back of hormone therapy. E z 'Yasmin, she doesn't feel your pain. She is not... I can not... I am true that she is in pain, but it does not affect me. She would like it to go back to how it was before the wedding. How was it so different? She was free. I let her do it. Maybe she had too much freedom. And now... Rashi puts limits on her and she steers. There is something much deeper than freedom that only you can offer him. How you would like your mother to react in this situation ? I would like her to be there for me.

In the North with a girlfriend. We didn't say you would go. What ? We said that... Did you leave like that? I didn't think it was a problem. It's not every day that a friend invites me. Are you kidding me ? Don't you understand when you are told it's not the right time? But that's not what you said. Do I have to shout for all the neighbors to hear? I do not know what to tell you.

You play the victim. At least what is certain is that I am not alone... Shut up, let me talk. How did you get the nerve to go tell daddy's boss how poor a guy he was and how unhappy you were to have been abandoned and unloved. Stop telling me about daddy. You love to say that I am adopted, that we make the distinction. It's not to distinguish, it's the truth. Who cares? You can't tell the difference between honesty and truth. You're a crooked liar who thinks you're telling the truth. Go away or I'll hit you. That's it, you're just rot, you get upset and you kick.

Maybe it took let her make this difficult journey. - Can I intervene? - Sure. You give men the power to dictate which woman you are. You study their masculinity and their motivations in order to understand your report to them. I want to say... It's the starting point of your artistic quest.

She's been like this for a long time - I just arrived. But yes, I think so. She's been shaken up since she got the news. What news'. 7 I can only hear him cry. She will announce it to you herself. Thank you. What is happening '? They called me yesterday. They told me... that I can go get the little one. - What ? - I can go get my baby. Are you not happy? I am super happy that they called and they accepted. Now it's your decision. We're not very close and I don't know... if my opinion counts, but... You can't let mom run your life. She's done enough damage already. I think you shouldn't be afraid even though I'm glad that you doubt. Of course I am afraid. What do you believe ? You always seem so sure of yourself everything always seems so perfect and obvious to you that the slightest doubt or the slightest fear can ruin everything. You see ? You don't really know me. You also go through things. So let's bring some light back. Light... This is what it is. In her room, she lights everything. You know, little by little, we can make his room in dad's office. Is she going to stay with you forever or can her mom still show up? Being a foster family is not like adopting. But her mother practically abandoned her. Forget his mother. She has a very sad story.
