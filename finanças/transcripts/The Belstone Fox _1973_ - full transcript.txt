Ripped, corrected and synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Get on. Get on. And so began the strange and terrifying story of the Belstone Fox. Glad it's over? Are you glad the season's over? Yes, I suppose I am. Doesn't get any easier. How's your back tonight? Not too bad. How is Mr Kendrick? - He's all right. - I'm glad. - It hasn't been a bad season. - I often think of him you know. Sitting up there in that big house all on his own. Must get terribly lonely without her. So close. Asher. Did you talk to him about retiring? No Cathie, I didn't. Asher, you're not a young man any more. I told you, I'll go on as long as I can and that's final. Oh, come on, girl, it's not as bad as all that. It's just my old bones start aching sometimes, that's all. That sounds like Flagon. Better go and have a look. - Here, give me that. - Ah. You'd be a rich man if Mr Kendrick paid you overtime. Aye. Who's that talking? Who's making all that noise? What are you all doing? Hello my lovelies. How are you doing. Are you well? Flagon? Had a busy day today, didn't you? Hey. Hey! You stay there. What are you doing? All right, that's enough, that's enough. Settle down, settle down. Settle down. Get down. Get down now. Down. That's it. How are you my lovely ladies? Aye. Good night, my beauties. Well, that's that then. - Everything all right? - Yes, they were just a bit excited, that's all. - I'll just wash these cups up. - Oh, come on my dear, - leave 'em for the moment. - Yes. Come on. It's all right, I'll go. It's all right, it's only Tod. Come in, love. You go right through now. Tod. Asher. Hey. What you got there? Poor little devil. - Who did it, d'you reckon? - I don't know. Like to get me hands on 'em. - What about the others? - Dead. All dead. Yeah, this one's dying too. - He ain't dead yet. - Might as well put it out of - its misery. - Asher. Put it in with the bitch, Old Ruin. She only whelped last week. If she takes to it, it might survive. If she don't, it won't be there in the morning. Well, at least it'll have a chance. Hello, old girl. How are you then, Ruin? Eh? Look here, eh? That's it. There's a good old girl. There, good old girl. Now, go on, you get in there. That's it, that's it. There we are, old girl. Asher. What is it? - Oh, it's nothing. - It's that fox isn't it? Yes. Morning, Dad. You're up early. Yes. Where are you going? - Secret? - You wait and see. Oh, Dad! Ruin? But it...? Where did it come from? Tod brought it in last night. Where's its mother? Someone knocked her off, I s'pose. Why? Some people don't like foxes. Stephen had been with Asher for four seasons. Several of his ancestors had been huntsmen. And Stephen was anxious to follow in their footsteps. But for a few seasons more, he would have to curb his ambition. And content himself as whipper-in. Now then, come in and get over. Order. Get in, get in. Morning, Ash. Morning, master. - Beautiful day, sir. - Lovely. - Morning, Stephen. - Morning, sir. - How's he getting on? - Oh, not badly at all sir. Bit over enthusiastic but that's not a bad fault. - Mr Kendrick, sir... - Yep? - About Ruin. - Ruin, what about her? She's nursing a fox cub. - A what? - Ruin, sir. She's nursing a fox cub. - Are you being serious Ash? - Yes, sir, I am. Well, Tod brought it in, it was damn near dead. I gave it to Ruin, I thought she'd eat it. She's fostering it instead. - I know I really shouldn't sir but-- - Well, phww, damn me! What an amazing huntsman I've got. In fact, bloody unique, if you ask me. Ruin nursing a fox cub? My God, what an extraordinary arrangement! - Do you object, sir? - Object? 'Course I don't. Good luck to 'em. Better keep quiet about it, though. Yes, sir. Right, on yer way. - Come on here. - Here, boy. Come on puppies, come on, come here. Come here, come on. There's a good boy. There's a good boy, come on. Proper Rag Tag and Bobtail, aren't they? Tag, that's what I'm gonna call him. Tag? Ah, you can do better than that Jenny. No, Tag, that's it. - Stephen. - Yeah? - Where's Dad? - He's in there, naming the pups. Come on. You named Ruin's litter yet, then? I'm just doing that now. Hang on. Er, dam's Ruin... Pretty fine job you made of it. - Er, sire was, erm...? - Marshall. Marshall! Him from Brocklesby, fine animal. - All names beginning with M, then? - That's right. We've got 'em all too; Millie, Melody, Meanwell, Menacer, Merriment. All except Tag's little friend. - Oh, let me do it. - All right then. Hurry up though, 'cause I've gotta get the book up to Mr Kendrick. Miracle? Miracle! - Magic? - No. - Em... Mercury. - Oh, really, Stephen. Oh, come on. I know, Merlin. Merlin. Merlin it is, then. Oh, damn. Done it again. Er... Now, where were we? Ah yes, the walk situation. Well, there's only one left. We can look after that one ourselves. - And which one's that? - Merlin. Oh, you know the one, from Ruin's litter. - Ah, the one with the foxy friend? - That's the one. Ah, yes. - How about the fox, eh? - Oh, it'll go of its own accord. - You sure? - Yes. Fox'll always go back, unless you chain him up. I'll not do that. How am I doing, Ash? - How're you doing what? - How am I doing? You know, the whole thing. The hunt, the house, sitting up here playing the bloody squire. Tell me Ash, am I getting away with it? Well, I try my damnedest not to let old Belstone down, even if he is only a fixture and fitting. Oh, you know what I mean. Only bloody money put me in here, damn all else. But it's them that worry me. Don't know what they're saying behind my back. Ah, blast it, Ash, tell me what they're saying. I want to know. Yes, sir but why ask me? Because you were the first person round here to accept me for what I am. And that means a lot to me. Hell of a lot. Well, Mr Kendrick... I don't know. I don't know what people say. I wouldn't give a damn if I did. - Hello, Dad. - Hello. Hello, son. You're beautiful. There. I didn't hurt you, did I? Come on Merlin, come on Tag. - Morning, Tod. - Hello Jenny. Hello boy. Tag. It was a time of learning for both of them. The world was a treasure house of fascinating experiences. Some known, some unknown. And all with hidden meaning. The lived through their noses. Their quick young brains sifting and storing the information they gained. And as spring gave way to the richness of summer, the living was easy and always, it was a time for play. The pair of them were inseparable. Where ever one went the other would always follow. Oh, my God, who let them in?! It doesn't matter now, just get 'em out! Go on, out! Go on! Out, out! Go on! - Out, out, both of you. - Get-- Oh, what a mess! Look at this. I mean it's ruined! You must have left the back door open, you know. Jenny, you are a silly girl, I could murder them! - Oh, I'm sorry. I really am. - Yeah...! Now, don't take on so. It's not the end of the world. Certainly looks like it. Dad? What's gonna happen to Tag and Merlin when you start hunting? Oh, I'll just shut him up for the day. If we can get him in, that is. Supposing he gets out? Ah, he's old enough. He can look after himself. Suppose you find Tag one day, and Merlin's in the pack. Will Merlin hunt him too? Ah, it's ridiculous. But it could happen. It could couldn't it? Oh, don't bother me, get on with your work. He left it as late as he dared. But at last he could delay it no longer. Merlin had to go into kennels with the young hounds. It was a time to say goodbye. - Get down. - And a difficult time for us all. Get in. Get back down. Come on. There y'are, Merlin. My beauties. Breakfast time. Go on. Careful. He'll be all right. I know he will. What are you still hanging about here for? Why don't yer clear off? Go on go. Go on, I tell yer! Go on, get out. Go on! Get out! Get out! The first day's cub-hunting was now set for the second Tuesday in September. On the Monday afternoon, Asher drew his pack. He had to take as many hounds as he could. For one of the purposes of cubbing was to teach young hounds how to hunt the fox. But if he took too many hounds, control might be difficult. Seedlling. - Seedling. Ah, get back. - Wait a minute. Pilgrim. Pilgrim? Here, teach the young 'uns a thing or too. Ha. Merriment, come on, Merriment. - Merlin. - Merlin? Yes, Merlin. - Eighteen an' a half couple? - Yes, sir. Put 'em all in. Among many other things, Tod was an earth-stopper. The night before a hunt when foxes were out and about, he would silently find their earths, and block the entrances. Thus denying them a refuge the next day. By now Tod was almost nocturnal. And if by day his eyesight was not particularly good, by nightfall his senses combined to find his way across country even on the darkest night. So it's Burnett's Wood tomorrow, then? Aye. - Or maybe Hantwell Gorse. - You'll not get there. We might. It's pretty thick in Burnett's Wood isn't it? Thicker than ever I've seen it. Oh, we might have to stop there. - How many in it? - Two litter. Three brace and two and half brace. Could be all right. You taking Merlin? Aye. He all right? I'll tell you that tomorrow night. Hey, twenty-one. Tod... Is that ah... fox around? Fox? What fox you talkin' about? You know damn well which fox I mean. - Not where you're going. - No but he is around somewhere? Tod, I mean, he's all right isn't he? He's looking after himself all right? All right? 'Course he's all right! He's a fox, ain't he? - Right Stephen, let 'em go. - Right sir. Come on. Come on, come on. - Right, right, come on. - Come on. Come on now. Come on now, come on up. Merlin, get on, get on! Bouncer, get off, come on, get off. Forward, forward. Be fair, Stephen, give 'em a chance to empty 'emselves. Aye, sir. Get over, get over. - Morning, sir. - Ah. - Thank you. - Thanks. Very well, Asher. Hounds, please. Ah, here they are. Get up there, come on. Get on. Well, get up, get up. Come on then. Right, er, Major, would you take the Busby Girls up the topside with you? - Right, master. - Very good. Cub-hunting always started before the season proper. And in order to make it easier for the young hounds, the hunt usually tried to confine the young fox to a small wood or cover so that it could not escape over the countryside. Keep back, Peter go with Steve. Right, Ash. Leu in there, leu in. Leu on, leu in. Leu in Merlin, leu in, leu in. Leu in. Come on, come on, then. Get 'em up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get on. Come on, then, come on. Get on, get on. Come on, then. Come on. Get on, get on. Get on there. Come on. Get on... come on. Get on. Well done, Stephen, you hang on to it. - Thank you, sir. - Now, where's that young Katie? - Stephen. - Coming. Right, darling, first kill. Come along, Katie, get down. Ah! There you are. Tell your mother not to wash it off. All right? One short. - Ah, which one? - Merlin. - One short, are you? - Yes, sir. - Which one? - Merlin, sir. Well, never mind, he'll probably be waiting for you when you get home. Let's go. Come on, Joseph. Go on. Go on. He'll turn up, Dad. - Yes, I know, love. - No, really, I mean it. You're a good kid. I'll just have another look. I'll have the tea ready. You're a good kid too. What's the matter Merlin, hey? What's the matter? I dunno what I can do. You can't go on mourning forever. Come on then Merlin, come on, boy. Billy. Cheers, Steve. How's about our 'untsman then eh? Hey? Mooning about the place over his favorite. Ha. Waiting for the miracle. Ah yes, a miracle? You know perfectly well what I mean. - Do I? - Of course you bloody do. - Watch it, Steve. - I mean that hound, you know the one I mean. What's he doing taking it out day after day? He ain't gonna enter, not in a month of Sundays. And what would you do about it then? Knock him on the 'ead. Anything. But I wouldn't keep taking him out where he'll have a bad effect on the rest. No, d'you know why Asher won't give up? 'Cause he let a hound chum up with a fox. And he won't admit it was a mistake. Now that hound's never been right since Tag left, and what's more, he-- You listen to me you blown-up young toad. You're working under a man who's forgotten more about hounds than you'll ever learn. What's more, he's straight, straight as a die. One thing you won't find him doing, is talking about you behind your back. He's a good lad Tod, it's only the beer talking. I don't care what it is that's talking. I'll not listen to no one being clever about Asher Smith. He worships him. Funny way of showing it. - Morning, Jenny. - Morning, Mr Kendrick. All right? I'm a patient man, Ash, but if he doesn't enter today you'd better get rid of him. Yes, sir. - Very well. - Sir. Gilly. Stephen. Come on. Come on, my beauties. Come on, my beauties. Come on, then. Come on, lads. Leu in then. Leu in. Leu in, leu in, leu in. Leu in, then. Leu in. Leu in there. Go on. Come on. Watch him go, lad! Look at that, lad! Look who's leading 'em! Come on now, get up! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on now. Better luck next time. - Want to draw again, sir? - No, Ash, we've had a hard day, and there's no scent anyway. I think we'll go home. - Right, sir. - Goodnight. Come on Joseph, come on. Go there, boy. - Hold on, sir. - Go on. Stephen. Here, Merlin. Come here, boy. You just watch that hound go from now on, lad. Yes, sir. Here, come on, my beauties. Come on, come on, my beauties. - Come on then. - Get in. The legend of the Belstone Fox was now starting to take shape. Merlin had at last come into his own. And it was not long before the huntsmen came to rely on him more and more. But although many times he found foxes for them, He would never involve himself in the actual kill. If Asher had a great interest in Merlin, Tod had an even deeper one in Tag. But as Tag often travelled many miles in a single night, the old man had a hard job trying to keep up with him. After nearly two years Tag eventually established his territory in a corner of Kennel Wood. And settled down to the quiet life, except for his excursions with the hunt, which he found pure joy. Slow down at the back there. Afternoon, Cathie. - Oh, hello, Mr Kendrick. - Busy? Yes. Asher about? Yes, he's in the house with Tod. Ah, mind if I have a word with him? Oh, please, please do. How's that pretty young daughter of yours? She'll be back from college next week. Ah, just in time for the party, eh? - She won't miss that, Mr Kendrick. - Ah, good. - Bye. - Bye. Sorry sir, just dozed off. Sunday lunch. Never mind about that. Have you seen this? - No, not yet, why? - Now, look Ash. Have you told anyone about Tag? About him growing up in the kennels I mean? - Of course not. - Tod? No, sir. Just listen to some of these stories, er... Belstone Hunt, et cetera... Ah. "Some of his ploys are indeed remarkable. "On one occasion he made a wide "detour in order to run through a vegetable garden and enter "the back door of a small cottage. "He then left by an open window at the front, ran down the path, "and finally eluded his pursuers by a quick dash over the church meadow. "Other of his tactics are even more amazing. "Finding the hounds too close for comfort, he actually escaped by floating off on a piece of driftwood over the waters of "Wootton Reservoir. While the hunt tried to cut him off by riding "along the top of the dam itself... "but once again, with no success whatsoever. "Another characteristic of this fox is his familiarity with the "appurtenances of what we in the country call 'progress'. "Having been chased into a small village, "he jumped into the back of a baker's van. "And according to reports, although this is not easy to verify, "he was then actually driven away from the scene of the hunt, "while the baker's van was apparently followed for several miles, "by one solitary foxhound." I can guess which one that was. "And on at least two occasions when hounds and about fifty "people have met on the Green, the fox has been observed sitting "on a nearby waste bin, surveying the scene with great interest "and evident enjoyment." Enjoyment! Here, read it for yourself. Pretty close to the truth. Are you gonna try and catch him this season? - Well, I always try don't I? - I don't know. - Do you? - Of course I do. Are you absolutely certain you've never helped him? Just they teeniest bit? I don't think so. - I think so. - Oh, when? Well, let's think now. How about the time you marked him to ground in the stoneworks earth? Why didn't you call the terriers and dig him out? I seem to remember they were a long way off. Oh, come off it Ash, they weren't that far away. Any other fox I reckon you'd have had out of there. Then what about the time they lost his line in Canter's water meadow? You saw him lying up in the willows didn't you? How the devil did you know that? Ah, I've got my spies everywhere. - You, Tod, I ought to wring your-- - Now then, Ash. Tod wasn't telling tales out of school. He only told me because he knew I was interested in his precious fox. Still am, come to that. Well... I hunted him last Friday. I know, and you didn't catch him either cause I seen him come home. Ah, I'm worried. - There's something wrong with it. - Oh? - Hunting Tag. - I wouldn't worry about it if I was you. I reckon young Tag can take care of his self. Well, it's not only Tag, it's Merlin. You know there's something between those two. Oh, stop chuntering, boy! There's nothing wrong. Well, you'd soon change your tune if we killed that precious - fox of yours. - Ah ha, kill Tag? There's only one hound'll ever get the best of that one. And he's no more kill him than fly. I got thirty couple more that would. No. That's no ordinary fox. You can hunt him as much as you like... but you'll never catch him. Never. - Cheers. - Cheers. Excuse me. - Enjoying it? - Hmm. - Seamus! Peter! - Hey. Hello darling. Dad, two of my friends from college. - Drink? - How lovely. - Bloody impossible place to find. - More like a safari. Jenny, come and have a dance. Just a minute. Stephen: Peter, Seamus. - Hey, Jenny! - Coming Gordon. And ah, what do you do in the hunting fraternity? - Whipper-in. - Uh, whipper what? Oh, I know, one of those doggy fellows. - Evening, Ash. - Evening, sir. Where's the birthday girl? Ah. - Congratulations. - Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you Mr Kendrick. Oh, that's beautiful my dear. Thank you, Asher. - Happy birthday! - My darling. Wonder if some of you wouldn't mind going in the other room, it's getting frightully crowded in here. Come on, Stephen, no wallflowers in this one, come and have a dance. Come on Asher, come on. - You never married did yer Tod? - Nope. I didn't have to. - What's going on? - Nothing to worry about, Jenny. Too much booze. Bye, Jenny. Bye! Bye, Peter. Bye, Seamus! See you next term! - Asher? - Yes? - Come and help with the washing up. - All right, my dear. Come on, Jenny, don't catch a cold. You look awful. Happy birthday. Oh, I'll see yer tomorrow at the hunt. Oh, no, you won't. - Why, your horse lame? - No. Things are a bit different now. - Oh, how? - Well, in lots of ways. I'm now what's called an "anti". - Huh, a what? - An anti. Anti-hunting. Huh, fox hunting? Any kind of hunting. Look Jenny, I um... well I, I did want to talk to you about somethin' - tonight. - What? Well, you know I've been with the Belstone now for like seven seasons. Well, the Medvale hunt, they've written to me and asked me to join them. As huntsman. Now, that'd be a big leg up for me. So? Well, you know I'm very fond of your father. I'd... Well, I don't wanna feel I'm letting him down. You can't be number two forever, you'll have to move sometime. Yeah. You see, I was hoping you'd move with me. I don't know. I'll have to think about it. Night night, Stephen. - Get up, get up. - Go on, gon now. No sign of the beggar Ash, that's a surprise. - Yes, sir I thought he'd be there too. - Perhaps he decided to retire? Oh, not him sir. I expect he's sitting somewhere laughing at us. Looks like Robin's Wood, then. - Come on, Joseph. - Yes, sir. Go on then, wooh, go on. All right, my fine, foxy friend. Now let's see what you're really made of. Come on, now! Right there, boy. Get up there! We'll call 999... I'll collect up what's left. Damn him. Come in, Asher. Now look Ash, why don't you sit down. - I think I'd rather stand, sir. - Oh, damn and blast it, man sit down when you're bloody well told. Huh. Well, what's it gonna be? - The usual? - Doctor said something about not - drinking for a day or two. - Horse manure, it'll do you good. I doubt it. Now look Ash, stop worrying about your hounds. We're all upset about it, but after all they were my hounds, weren't they? - I don't see why you should-- - I know sir, but there's a bit more - to it now than that. - Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, what the hell! I've gotta kill that bloody fox. According to you that's what you've been trying to do for the past - three years. - I know but now I've really got to kill him. Now look Ash, I don't think we see eye to eye over this. As far as I'm concerned it was an accident. A bloody unfortunate one but an accident for all that. And I'm not going to have you running a private vendetta against the Belstone fox at the expense of the entire hunt. - I-- - That's pure revenge. I must say I'm surprised. Yes, really shocked. - That a man of your calibre and experience-- - Oh, shut up! Just listen, please. You haven't begun to understand. Now look. I've learned a bit about foxes over the past forty years. I'll tell you one thing I know. If a hunted fox discovers a way of throwing hounds off his scent, he'll use that method again, sure as I'm sitting here. Now, I know it was a accident when Tag ran that railway line. But the result's exactly the same. He'll know that running the line'll get the hounds off his tail. He's proved it, so he'll go on doing it again and again. And we'll go on losing more and more hounds. So now do you see? I've just got to kill him. I'm sorry, Ash. I tend to forget that you know a hell of a lot more about these things than I do. Well, that's that then. Better organise a drive and shoot the devil. No sir, not that way. - Why the hell not, man? - That'd be wrong. I've got to hunt him, fair and square. - Now look Ash, be reasonable. - No, sir. It's gotta be that way. Or nothing. You sure you'll be fit enough for Saturday? 'Course I will, lad. Won't need this on a horse. Game of darts, Gilly? - It was an accident, no one's to blame. - It was my fault. - No. - It was. They were playing a game those two, all these years, and I played it with 'em. Now you know I could have killed that fox once, maybe twice. No, I went against nature. That's why it went sour. Now, I'm gonna kill that fox. You can't do it Asher. Look Tod, I told you, I got to do it. Asher! Look, I'm coming with you. Wait, Asher, I've worked it out. You don't have to kill him. Listen, I've been feeding him now, for a couple of years. I know where he is, where he goes every minute of the day. Listen, it's easy. Before you go hunting, I'll stop him in. Give him some grub. When you get back I'll let him out, he'll soon get used to it. You don't have to kill him, Asher. Look Tod, it's no good - I can't risk it. Asher, that fox and you, it's all I live for. Don't do it, Asher. Asher, please! Asher, give him a chance! - Morning, Ash. - Morning, sir. - How'd you feel? - Very well, thank you, sir. Look, if you're not a hundred percent better say so right now. I'll be all right sir. Good luck. Stubborn old devil. Nice to see you. Asher, hounds please. - Another blank, eh, Ash? - I'm sorry, sir. - Tod stopped all the earths I suppose. - No he didn't, sir. I did. Every one. Right then. Kennel Wood. Yes, sir. Kennel Wood. Leu in lads, leu in. Leu in, leu in. Go on. Leu in there, leu in, then. That's it. Come on, my beauties. Leu in, leu in. That's it. Find him out, then. Go on lads, go on then. Find him. Go on then, go on. Go on. Go in lads. Leu in, then. That's it. Go on Micheal. - That him? - Aye. Over there! Go on. - Go on, go on. - Go on. Lost him again eh? Asher. Gone home. Get up, boys! For'ard! Go on! - He's gone out the back. - Got him? - No sir. - Damn, go on then. Go on. Go on lads. Go on. You all right? Yes, I'm all right. Right. Blast! No, not that way! Can't you see? Go on there, go on. Geeyah, go on, go on, go on, go on. Asher, what's wrong? Why aren't you with your hounds? - Fresh fox; they've changed. - Blast it. Still, can't be helped. Come on then man, get back to your pack. Asher. Get back to your pack. There's my pack sir. For God's sake man, what's wrong with yer? - Nothing's wrong. - Asher Smith, If you don't do as you're told then you're no longer hunting my hounds. - Is that clear? - I'm staying with my pack, sir. Go on then, go ahead, hup, go on... Come on. - Go on. - Go on. Oh, for God's sake, take it, man. You're hunting hounds, Stephen. Sir, where's Asher? Back there somewhere, you're hunting hounds now. No, I must stay with him. You'll do as you're bloody well told, boy. Here. Go on there boy, go on, go on. Found 'is 'orse, o'er by Badge Hill Way. Couldn't follow, frost covered up his tracks. - Oh, well, let's get over there. - No. Black as pitch. Be dawn in a hour, we go then. - Yeah, I'd better phone the master. - You do that lad. Mr Kendrick? It's Stephen. Look, er, Tod's just come back. - What's happening? - It's all right. - What? - We're just going to fetch him. - Morning, Stephen. - Sir. Tod. Think we'd better take Ash's wagon. Wait! All right Jenny, jump in. It's cold as hell out there you know. - I don't think-- - You don't know anything yet. Stephen. -- English --
