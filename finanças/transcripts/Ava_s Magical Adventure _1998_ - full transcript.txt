Girl: Hi. My name is Eddie. When my mom and I first moved to this town called hubble, I thought it was the most boring place on earth. Boy, was I wrong. This is a story of how an amazing insane ringmaster, an escaped convict, my mom's good-for-nothing boyfriend, and a bumbling mayor helped me and a 7-ton elephant become best friends for life. It all started when a funny little circus came to town. [Whistle blows] [All talking] Come on, guys. Come on, guys. Come on, guys. Mom, come on! We're late! Hooner! I-I've lost my cup. My cup just vanished. I was drinking. It's gone. I don't know... where'd it go? My favorite cup. My favorite cup. What might be your second most favorite? Oh, well... The cowboy cup, but I don't... It's probably missing, too, so... Get along, little dogie, get along. Get along, get along. There you go. [Stammers] Ok. What about a tie? Oh, right. That's right. Um, uh, what've we got? What've we got? Too loud. Too blue. Too... ah. This one. Looks good. This looks very presidential. Yeah. I'll wear this. Ok, fine. Whatever looks good. I'll wear the blazer. Uh-huh. Yeah. Right. You take the blazer. Wally, come on. Wally! Wally! Come on, Wally! I won't look... I won't look too rich, will I? Because I don't want to look richer than them. Shoot. Everybody knows you're not rich, Mr. Mayor. [People chattering] It's mayor time! [Cheering and applause] [Music stops] I am the mayor. I am the mayor. What do you think sounds good? I am the mayor. First one. I am the mayor. I am the mayor. That means I get things done. I am the mayor. I am the mayor. Ok. You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. There it is. 5... 4... 3... 2... And one. Good morning... And welcome to this morning's edition of I am the mayor. Today's first story begins where yesterday's last story ended. It didn't really end, but we... The batteries went out on the camera. But the widow yeats' cat is still missing. Anyone with information as to her whereabouts... The cat, that is, not the widow... Uh, would please inform the widow yeats on the phone number on the screen. Do you have the phone number? Well, that about wraps it up, except to say that, uh, next Tuesday is election day. And you know who's running for mayor, because I am the mayor. Cut. Cut. What? Turn it off! [Festive accordion music playing] [Bicycle horn honks] [Honk honk honk] I'm glad you guys could join US. [People chattering] [Chattering continues] [Laughter and chattering] [Chatter continues] Man: This ain't gonna hold me up. This is not gonna work. Second man: Every night. I don't think this is gonna hold me up. Come on! The level of the ground, like, in a 45-degree angle. Hey, Norman! Norman! We're getting paid tonight, right? Of course, stretch. That's what you said 3 towns ago. I'm doing all I can. Listen, you think guys are gonna just keep working... [Elephant trumpets] Oh, wow! So cool. I can't believe this is a real elephant. Hey, what's your name? I wish I knew your name. Wow. Oh, this is amazing. Hi. [Knocks on tusk] Wow. Oh, no, no, it's painted Ava. Rose, who's the kid? Get her out of here. [Man yelling] Get the kid out of here, ok? It's dangerous. [Man yelling] Ok, ok. What is this country coming to? Look at this. Where's my mom? She's at work. Is she working late? She left a note for you on the refrigerator. Yeah, well, I saw the one she left you. Guess you couldn't get to it, huh? Yeah, well, I haven't been feeling very well today, edwina. I see, Jeff-freak. [Circus music playing] Ringleader: Ladies and gentlemen, the incredible Bob slayton and his one ring wonder, a spectacle the likes of which you have never seen before! [Applause] Ringleader: Ladies... Gentlemen... children of all ages... Welcome. Welcome one, welcome all. We who call this one-ring wonder a plethora of frivolities invite you... yes, you, the people of, uh... Norman, hoarsely: Hubble! Hubbleville! Ringleader: Hubbleville... heh heh heh... Hubbleville to sit back, relax... [chuckles] And enjoy the greatest show on earth! [Circus music playing] [Laughter and applause] Hey, hey! Oh, boys, boys! Oh, we've got to get this bathing thing together! Vendor: Peanuts... peanuts, here. Peanuts. Aah! [Grumbling angrily] [Makes gagging sounds] Norman! I was just with that. I heard you call. I wanted to make sure that... my hat. Would it be bad if I... I want to make... Is it a problem if I... I don't care which, Norman, but please, finish one of those sentences! What is this? Slayton ignoring a fan. 5 notices, blah, blah, blah. Taxes! $80,000? Norman! Criminal charges! Norman! This notice I hold in my shaking hand says we haven't paid our income taxes, filed our income taxes in the past 5 years! Please tell me that there's some kind of monstrous mistake on their part, Norman. Please tell me that! Please tell me something! That's ridiculous. I file your taxes every year. Right in the file cabinet. File in the filing cabinet! Unh! You're supposed to mail them, Norman. You're supposed to mail them! Look. [Screams] [Audience chattering] Oh... whoa! Man: You call that a circus? [Faint applause] [Humming] My hat, my hat! [Humming] My hat! Ugh. Bring my hat, Norman. Got it. I got your hat. [Applause] Ava... Trunk. [Trumpets] [Chuckles] Ava... Ava... Ava... Ava... Sit, Ava. Oh, god. Ava! Ava, stand! Ava! [Crying softly] [Ava trumpets] Ava... come. Ava, come. Come, Ava. Come, Ava! [Laughter and faint applause] Oh, get away from me! You want to be ringmaster, too, don't you? And you... I'll have your hide for this if it's the last thing I do, Ava. [Groans] Get away from me! Stop it! [Screaming] [Growling] It was good. It wasn't bad. Must you mock me every time? What on earth are you babbling about? They loved you. They loved you. Listen to them. [Distant applause] They want me. Crowd, chanting: We want more! We want more! Out of my way. Crowd, chanting: Slayton! Slayton! No, I tripped. No, he didn't push me. I tripped. [Applause continues] [Dog barking] Wow. I'd like to see dinner. Is there dinner? I thought you were bringing home dinner. No, no, no, no. Remember when I left for work? You said, "what do you want to do about dinner?" And you said, "never mind. I'm gonna cook Eddie spaghetti." Remember? Yeah. Sorry. Ok, well, I'll just whip something up. No. No. You didn't go shopping, either. No, I forgot. You know what I did remember to do, though? Heh. I made a bath for you. [Gasps] You made a bath? Yeah. I put your favorite bath gel in. Oh, you made me a bath! Yes, I did. [Both laughing] Mom, there's a circus... Sorry. A circus, huh? Oh, wow! That's great! Did you eat? Yeah, I ate at the diner. Oh. Well, that's good. So, how's school? Fine. Did you do your homework? I'm going to my room. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna go check on the bath. Hey, I'm gonna take a quick bath, and then I'm gonna come in and check your homework. Ok? You can explain it. Come on. Right. Jeffrey: Honey, it's getting cold. Come on. Jeffrey: Oh, you know what I wanted to talk to you about? What? You know, I've been thinking a lot about Eddie. [Gasps] Oh, you have been? Yeah. Why? I was thinking maybe you should send her away to boarding school. Boarding school? Yeah. Here. Here you go. Yeah, here you go. You're the most hysterical part of the show. [Ava grunts] Wait a minute. You're not really white. You're not even a girl! How are we doing, boss? Well, we're... Running out of hooch. Almost. [Laughs] Oh, we only owe $80,000 in back taxes, thanks to you. We're broke. Yeah, but with tonight's take... We're broke! Things were never like this when Clayton ran the circus. [All chattering] Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up, all of you. Just shut up. I told you... Never to mention that mountain-tending misanthrope's name again! Do I make myself clear? How about just paying US the money you already owe US? Yeah! Well, how about I call your parole officers? Hmm? Oh, I'm sure they'd like to know where you all are right now. Hmm? Maybe they can come up with a solution to our problem. What do you think, huh? All right, you... you... Clowns! Get out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Norman! Norman. Norman, sit. Norman... What have we got in this blasted circus of shame that is of any value? The camper. My camper? Norman... heh heh... Norman, this is the only place in the entire world where a man of my responsibilities, of my burdens, can rest his weary bones. You really want to take that away from me, Norman? I think not. Well, there's Ava. Truer words were never spoken. You know, sometimes I get lonely, too. You know what? I have an idea. Maybe while you're out here, I could, you know, get you ready for shows and take care of you. [Ava grunts] Uh, let me ask, ok? Hold on. Excuse me. Yeah? Uh, do you think maybe while you guys are in town, I could maybe take care of Ava? Maybe if she has more company, she could behave better and stuff. I don't know. You gotta talk to ringmaster slayton about that. Slayton? Where can I find him? Um, I think he's over by the clowns over there. Uh, he's probably in his trailer right now. Ok, thanks. I'll be right back, ok? Don't go away. [Grunts] Oh, Norman. Old boy. [Chuckles evilly] Ava... otherwise known as Joe... Is almost worth his weight in gold. I knew you'd change your mind, boss. My god. He is insured to the hilt. $1 million. 1 million... say it, Norman! [Laughing] $1 million. I'm talking about my... I mean, our way out of this mess. Insurance! Insurance, Norman! And Joe, a.K.A. Ava, has got plenty of it! You can't collect on the policies unless she's... I'm no fool! Let me rephrase that. Shut up! Let me rephrase this now. They don't want to look like a huge penny-pinching corporation that would try and cheat a small traveling circus out of a few peanuts, Norman. We are part of the vanishing American landscape! Ha ha! [Growls] Promptly after tomorrow's performance, I'm gonna call the insurance investigators, let them know the horrible news that Ava is no longer among the living. [Drawer rattling] At which time, you... Will go to his pen. You will inject him. Inject him with this. There's enough juice in here to kill... well... An elephant. Heh heh heh. Get out of here. $1 million. Ava, come on. Ava, come on. I gotta get you out of here. They're gonna hurt you, ok? You have to come with me. I'm not gonna let them hurt you. Come on. You have to come with me, ok? Can you get up? Come on. Get up. [Grunts] Ava, come on. They're gonna hurt you. Come on, get up. Ok, good girl. Come on. Come on. Get up. Ok. Come on, Ava. Good girl. Come on. Animal keeper: Ava! Oh, my god. I lost the elephant. Slayton is going to kill me. I can't believe we got out of there, Ava. You know, they were gonna kill you. [Grunts] What's wrong with them? [Groans] Hey, Ava. Can I have a ride? [Grunts] Oh, cool. [Grunts] Ok, Ava, here's the plan. We're gonna head due north back where I come from and meet up with some of my friends, and then we could start a circus of our own. Yeah, that'll be fun. [Ava trumpets] [Ava trumpets] [Country music playing] We've got a busy crowd here. Look at that, frank! I'm not joking. Now, come on! Get with it! Put out those cigarettes! Howard, everything ok? Good. Pauline! Pauline, give me the number, please. Give me the number. What? The breakfasts! The breakfasts! How many breakfasts? 17. 17. Ok, we're doing all right. Yep, yep, yep, yep. [Knocks on door] Morning, sunshine! Up and at 'em! Ahem. Wait. I'm making you... a cappuccino. Thanks. You still make the best foam. It's all in the half-and-half. I gotta go. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. What? Don't we make a cute couple? Hmm? Hubba hubba. I'm late. Gotta go. Wait, you forgot... You know what? Right now, I could go for one of Leona's cream pies. [Ava grunts] That sounds great. Whoa. Where are you going? [Ava grunts] Oh, cool. Thanks, Ava. Oh, I can't wait to get one of these. Ok. [Ava trumpets] Ok. Hold on. [Crunch] Move up, and I'll get you another one. Move up. Come on. Ok. Here you go. Here. There you go. Ok, hold on. Move up. Go a little bit more. Here, I'll get one for you. Ok, come on. Gotta go. Here. There you go. Come on, we gotta go. Ahem... moving on. Moving on. A prisoner from the manson penitentiary escaped early yesterday morning and, uh, was, uh... is believed dangerous. Um... Mr. Clayton... uh, should... heh heh. Mr. Clayton should be near the fox river penitentiary, officials have estimated. No one should walk alone anywhere... oh, this is all new. No one should ever walk alone near the river banks or surrounding forests, day or night. Oh, Ava. It's so cool being out here all alone. Just you and me. No grown-ups to bother US. [Country music playing] ♪ I think I might have gave it away ♪ Oh, Leona, not another deputy. George, I don't tell you how to run the mayor's office. Don't you tell me how to run the sheriff's office. What's on your mind? Well, it's just that, well, with the collapse of the record sleeve industry and everyone in town losing their job and all, i'm... beginning to think I... let hubble down. Oh, come on, George. Nobody's gonna blame you for the c.D. Takeover. I know that. It's... it's just that... Well, I should have seen what was happening and led hubble into the future. Maybe you can find a niche for the 90s. That's it! What is it? What is so unique about hubble? Our hospitality? Not really. Your pies. The circus is in town! The circus! Bingo! Bingo? We have a bingo parlor? I didn't even know. George, no. No, no. That's just an expression. But you're on the right track. Come on, Ava. It's time to go. We've got to keep moving if we don't want to be caught. Come on. Up we go. Yeah, that's it. There we go. Come on. Come on, Ava. Come on. Yeah. I'm sure slayton must be looking for US by now. I don't want him to get you. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on, Ava. Yeah, that's a good girl. Yeah, there we go. Come on. Oh, you can eat more on the way. Come on. Let's go. What? You coming? Ava, come on. ♪ Yes, she's gone, gone, gone ♪ ♪ long, long gone ♪ ♪ hell and heaven won't bring her back ♪ Morning, hooner! Leona. You got something on your mind, boy? Oh, no, nothing on my mind. I was just talking to ringmaster slayton this morning, and he said that that elephant of his disappeared. It's missing. That's very peculiar. He said missing, Leona. Missing. That's what I heard. I was just dropping off some feeding. That's what I heard. Maybe I should have a talk with that ringmaster. What's his name? Mister... Slayton. Slayton. Boys! Tell Mr. Slayton to come visit me. Where is he? Where is he? Where would he be? George, I have a pie in the oven. Sure. Go on. Make it. [Ava trumpets] [Trumpets] [Blows] You know what, Ava? I've been thinking. You and me, we make a good team. You see, maybe we can beeline our way down to the airport, hop a plane to djakarta... Isn't that where your family's from? I think it's somewhere in India. And, uh, maybe then we can relocate you, your brothers and sisters, your mom and dad, and I could live with you. That would be cool. [Chuckles] Leona: All right, you replace those 2 fluorescents right there. Now, I want you to go inside and clean the windows from the inside. Outside looks fine, but it's a little foggy. [Whistles] Reach that sign up there. Reach... hey... oh, Mr. Slayton! I'm so glad to see you. I, uh, I understand that you have a missing elephant? Vanished. Gone. Gone from my life. I'm crestfallen. Well, in lieu of those circumstances, I've taken the Liberty upon myself to alert the local media, and here he is now. George, I know exactly what you're trying to do... I'm trying to something, my dear. I mean, I will leave no stone unturned because this is an election year. This is not the time to do this. George, don't think you can fool... Well, I'm not trying to fool anybody. This is not the time to do this. Believe me. This is not the time. Let's not make a scene, shall we? There is no way... please! My elephant's missing. Oh, yeah. The zero crime rate in this city is on the rise. Men! Grab your gear! Prepare for search and seizure. Lose all these clowns. I don't want any faces showing up on america's most wanted. Sheriff, what can you tell US about this area having supernatural powers? Nothing. Ringmaster slayton... Can you tell our audience why you're visiting the sheriff? Because my little beating heart has been ripped from my soul. Mr. Slayton, don't get carried away! I mean, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for this. Maybe she just wandered off. Oh, she didn't wander anywhere. Well, how do you know that? Because... because... Because of the tremendous lengths we went in training this particular elephant not to wander. Heh. And how, pray tell, is that accomplished? Oh, it's very simple, really. Norman! See, when she was just a little calf and she would start to wander, I would just SWAT her on the trunk. And I'd say, "no! No! No!" "No!" I don't think it was as simple as that. Oh, really? Well, you just leave the animal training to the professionals, will you? I don't want to talk about it anymore. I have a missing elephant to deal with! Norman! George: Missing? Missing? Did someone say missing? Oh, that... missing. George, what do you think you're doing? Well, I just want to say that I am not surprised. I am not surprised at all. Well, what's the scoop? Oh, there seems to be a gentleman behind me who has something to say. Let's hear what he has. Yes, sir? Think what you will. But keep an open mind to the possibility that we are not alone in these parts. Uh, thank you. Thank you. From channel 8 news, this is Emilio Hernandez reporting live... From hubble. Oh, mayor? Mayor, can I have a word with you? Yes, Mr. Slayton? Oh, by the way, I was so sorry to hear about your poor elephant. Oh! You don't know the half of it. Interesting thought occurred to me. I'd like to share it with you. I was thinking how this disappearance could actually help bring tourists into this part of the country. Yes, maybe it could, but I have a campaign to run, so it was lovely chatting to you. I'll speak to you later. Now, you listen to me, you little toad of a man. If you don't help me find my elephant, and by 3:00 today, I'm going to the boys over at channel 8. And I'm gonna tell them how you and I planned this whole stunt just to boost your tourism. And... Jeopardize the life of a little bird just to suit your own selfish needs in the process! Ha ha ha ha. You wouldn't. You wouldn't. No, no, no, no. You couldn't, and I won't let you. You wouldn't. [Laughing] You try me. [Laughs] Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, the hubble circus and the wild animal zoo would like to present to you the incredible Eddie and her amazing elephant Ava! [Playing blues music] [Deputy tap dancing] Stop it, sepson! Leona! Leona, I have found the answer to our town's prayers. Look, every place has its something. Niagara has its falls. Bermuda has its triangle. And Arizona has its London bridge. Now, hubble has its hexagon! George, are you swimming in the pool of derangement? You know I can't swim. But don't you understand? People are reporting things missing, and that's a fact! The facts are, we are living in troubled times. Look around you! Those things were either hocked or stolen. Don't say stolen! Say missing! It has such a nice ring to it. And when they find the elephant, your hexagon theory will be history. Shoot, if everything works out, they'll come by the truckload to see our hubble hexagon! [Giggles] Even he knows! Don't you see? They'll come here. It'll be a gold mine. They'll be buying t-shirts. They'll be buying ash trays. They'll be buying even little... Little... even hubble... hubble oven mitts. [Telephone rings] Waitress: Sheriff, can you get the phone? I'm kind of tied up. [Giggles] [Ring] Hello? He got what? He's where? Well, what do you mean, you don't know? Well, get on it, boy! The prisoner is headed this way! The missing prisoner? Escaped! And don't try to tie in that prisoner with your hexagon theory. Oh, my god! A missing prisoner has escaped! Yow! Leona: There you are. There you are. Oops. Pick that up. No, no, not you. Not you. Her. That's it. All right, troops, this is it. We have a missing elephant and an escaped convict! We must remember the missing elephant is missing from the circus. George, we have more serious matters here. You're not kidding. This elephant can do tricks and stunts. Oh, he does this thing with his trunk. You know, like he's taking a shower. George, George, George, George! George, George, George! George! Would you do me a favor? Go and eat some pie. Come on. Get going, get going. Go ahead. It's on me. All right, troops. Left! Face! Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut, 2, 3, 4. All right, deputies! Show them what you're made of! Come on, come on, get going, there! All right, let's have it. Snap to it. Hut, 2... stand up straight! Up straight and search! All right, here we go. I want... by the way, I want you all to report to me every half hour. Excuse me. Is that standard procedure? For search and seizure. Uh-huh. All right, come on, now! I want you to cover the area. Spread out! Now, wait. I know... I know it's not my field, but don't you think it would be better if they all stuck together? I mean, it is getting dark, and... and looking at these deputies, it seems like they could use some rest. Rest? Yes. They haven't even started yet. What are you, a crazy person? No, I'm the mayor, and I'm just... I care about my constituency. You know what they say. A tired voter is no voter at all. Why me, god? Why me? [Pecks piano keys] Hi. How are ya? [Door closes] [Whispering to self] Hey, baby. [Mumbling] Tough day, huh? I was just starting to hear it. Where's Eddie? Uh... [Pecks piano keys] No, that's not it. Where's Eddie? I don't know. Eddie? [Knock knock] Eddie? [Pecking keys] Eddie! Where is Eddie? Where is Eddie? God, she's 2 hours late. It's 7:00. So? What do you mean? She's 2 hours late! [Grumbles] That was part of the deal, right? When you're at home, you look after her. Yeah, well, if she was home, I would look after her. [Sighs] Ok. Ugh! Oh, my god. [Door closes] Hey. Who are you? What are you doing over here? I might ask you the same thing. What's your name? Eddie. What's yours? Call me Clay. Where'd you get the elephant? What elephant? Oh. Him. Yeah, him. You're not afraid of elephants, are you? Well, it's been a long time since... I've... Been around my share of animals. You running from the cops, kid? Hardly. The name is Eddie. Oh. So you're just taking your elephant for a little walk, huh? It's along story. I'll bet. It's dark. You want to share camp? Go ahead. You want to leave, fine by me. But it gets awfully dangerous out here at night. Scared? No. But I could use some company. Yeah, well... I suppose. Here we go, guys. More coffee. Don't you worry. We haven't forgotten you. How are you doing, Mel? You're looking very good today. Oh, Mary, I tell you, that walkie talkie does wonders for your eyes. Anyone I know? Oh, and how are you doing, sluggo? Hey! What the hell is going on here? Well, it was cold outside. I thought i'd bring the troops in. You know, let them recharge their battery, that sort of thing. Stop hindering my search or I'll slap you windy. Honestly, Leona. All I'm trying to do is lend a hand. Why don't you save it for your friends at channel 8? Well, that was meant as an insult. I intend to take it that way. Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! You heard her. Move it! Move it! We haven't got all day. Move it! Move it! My goodness, there's an elephant to be caught. Your feet hurt because you're always dancing. Now, move it. Move it. Go on. Any tips they left, just pick it up. I'll deal with it later. Slow down, girl. There's a lot more. I guess I'm hungrier than I thought. I'll tell you one thing. It ain't 'cause you're a good cook. But thanks anyways. You're welcome. So... What are you doing in these woods? No questions. Rules of the road. Ok. Look, Clay. We'll be out of here first thing in the morning. Ok? So you don't have to worry about US. I'm sure that you'll be able to take care of yourself, hmm? But... I'm sure that wherever you're running to is better than what you're leaving behind? Look, you don't know anything about what I'm leaving behind. But I know about running. I know it solves nothing. Well, how would you like to be sent off because someone wanted you out of the way? That's what my mom's boyfriend wants to do to me. Look, Eddie. Life... Throws you a lot of challenges. You've got to rise to them. You can't run away now... Or you'll always run away. Hmm? Camera man: And roll. Up... Ugh. He's such a nitwit. Updating our top story. A $600 award will... [stammers] Oh, god. Updating our top story, a $600 reward has been offered anonymously to anyone with concrete... Come on. Let's go. Let's go look for Eddie. You have no intention of looking for Eddie. You just want the money. Oh, come on. You want the money for the elephant, don't you? No. Come on, Sarah, that's crazy. Ok. I'm gonna go look for Eddie, all right? And when I get back, I want you gone. Sarah... Clay! I'm right here. Hey. I'm right here. Where were you? What the hell were you doing? I was, uh... I had to go... To the bushes. Yeah? Well... You practically scared me half to death. Well, you're all right now. Besides, you had Ava to watch over you. How'd you know his name? You told me. No, I didn't. Sure you did. Well, even if I did, which I didn't... Couldn't remember my name. So I seriously doubt you could remember his. It's hard to forget. Spill it. Ava and I used to work together. What? Mm-hmm. What do you mean? I am assuming that... Little Ava here is the property of slayton's one ring wonder. Yeah. How'd you know? It used to be called Clayton and slayton's one ring wonder. Get out of here! It's true. Clay is short for Clayton. Holy cow! What happened? It's a long story. I'll bet. Heh. Slayton and I used to be partners. But he didn't want to share half the profits with me, so he set it up for me to look like I was stealing, embezzling. His word against mine. Now, I'm gonna make sure that he pays for my lost time. Whoa. Yeah. So... Go back to sleep. But... Go back to sleep. I ain't going nowhere tonight. Go to sleep. [Birds cawing] Got to wake up! It's Ava, Clay! It's Ava. He's gone. What? He's gone! Ava's gone! We got to go look for him! So, what? Come on! He'll be back. He's an elephant. What are you talking about? Do you want him to be history? Slayton's going to kill him! What are you babbling about? I'm not babbling. All I'm trying to tell you is that if we don't find Ava, slayton is going to kill him for insurance money. I heard him telling some guy at the circus. Come on. We got to go find him! That's why I took Ava. To save him! Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this before, but you got to help me. Ok. Come on! Ok. Slow down. You know what'll happen if slayton finds him before we do? Slow down. We find Ava, we find slayton. Now, you know this area around here pretty well? Like the back of my hand. Like the back of your hand. Ok. Come on! Come on! Yeah. Let's go. Ok. Ava! Ok. Ava! Eddie: Clay! Where'd he go? Clay! Traitor! Clay: Please. Come on. Ava... Come on, Ava. Please, Ava. Pretty please, Ava. Come on. Hey! What's the big idea leaving me all alone in the woods like that? I just left you but 10 minutes ago. What're you doing with my elephant? Me and Ava got business with slayton. You're more like using her to get to slayton. Yeah. But she won't budge! Can I pick my teammates, or what? Good girl, Ava. Still think you're going somewhere without me? Don't seem likely. Ok, Ava. I think he learned his lesson. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Mayor's house. Take one. Testing. Testing. This is a special report from the mayor's house. A circus elephant answering to the name of Ava has recently been reported missing at the fairgrounds. It has now become conclusively clear that our sleepy little town is being rocked by an event of epic proportions, redefining our very existence. I think this map will help further illustrate my point. First, widow yeats' cat was seen to disappear right here. Second, the glasscock bicycle... Gone, right about here. Then, my own tea set that was handed down from hubble's past... Is gone. Missing. Right about here. The sheriff, i'm sure, will corroborate that there are many other missing items right here, here, here, there, and, uh, oh... here. And furthermore, my own private dog checkers... Many of you know him. You've seen the little scampering dog playing in your garbage. He's now vanished, right about... here. No. More like here. More... more... more there. Your house is right there. Is that where it is? Ok. There. Well... If we connect all these dots that have been put here, we will see a very diabolical discovery, far more imposing than that Bermuda triangle thing. We will have our own... Hubble hexagon. I thank you. This has still been a special report from the mayor's house. Whoa. Ohh! Thank you. Hey! [Blows whistle] [Mumbles] [Coughing] Slayton: The good news is, as expected... The insurance company has agreed to pay in full our claim against our dearly departed pachyderm. Ha. Yeah. On a more surprising note, they're sending insurance adjusters here on Tuesday to verify our claim. Of all the nerve. We have until Tuesday to produce a carcass, or I'm collecting on your insurance policies, which means I'm calling your parole officers and cashing in on your carcasses. Do I make myself perfectly clear? All: Yes. So, what are we going to do? You going to run away? You're going to find my elephant! Norman... Come on. You got to let me help. Come on! I want a piece of that rat, too. No! This is between Clayton and slayton, like it always was. I just need Ava to find slayton, and act like a little calling card. Smoke him out of hiding? Something like that. I don't want you near him. Understand? But you can't move Ava without me! She has gotten a little stubborn in her old age. [Grunting] So, we're teammates, then? No. Come on. You and me. It's too dangerous. Oh. I get it. I get it. You don't think your plan's going to work. You got to go home. Is there no honor amongst thieves? [Chuckles] I guess not. Just me and Ava this time. Ok? Ava! Ava! See, Clay? You need me. Sure. Ava! Come on. Go! Go! Go! Don't use the front door! Uhh! Ok. Get ready! Ready? Number 2! I said I'm doing number 2! 3! Number 3! Out! Uhh! 4! 4! Number 5. Number 5! Get out! [Blows whistle] Get out. Get out! To the fat farm. 6! Focus... Number 6! Focus, focus! To the house, focus! [Blows whistle] I don't believe this. [Mumbling] Car! Stupid car! It hates me! You hate me! I hate you! Leona, I can't believe your total disregard for my best intentions. This elephant is our trump card. Let's notify the media as soon as possible, and have them come down here to see that the hubble hexagon is swallowing up our countryside. George, George, George! Don't George, George, George me. Can't you see that there are unexplainable disappearances occurring here? George, there is a circus in town. Slayton: That's right. The circus is in town. And I want to know, immediately, to what lengths the sheriff's department is preparing and executing the search and recovery of my elephant. Well, Mr. Slayton, we are doing everything in our power to find that missing elephant. Man: Tell him, sheriff. Sheriff... Mayor, my child... missing. You mean little Eddie? Wow. All right. All right. Relax. Sit down. Have a cup of coffee. Now, listen. Let's talk about the election. All: Aw! What? George! I'm shocked and appalled. The hubble hexagon. Her daughter. George, you're one in a million, and I must speak out. I am going to vie for control of this town. I think that I would make a wonderful mayor. Now, I love you, little brother, but I'm going for it. Do you hear me? I'm going for it! You understand me. I am your little brother, and I'm also your mayor, and I refuse to allow you to run for mayor. Well, as sheriff of this town, I refuse to listen to you. What about Eddie? What about my elephant? What about the escaped convict? Convict? Eddie's out there. Believe me. Believe me, Sarah, we'll find her. Wait, wait. What about me, sheriff? What about my little Ava? Well, if you were any kind of a man, you'd help me find that little girl. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. If you were any kind of a woman, you'd be baking pie. I have a good mind... I doubt it. All right. All right. We're all adults here. Nobody panic, please. I am prepared to offer $500 to the first person who can disprove my hubble hexagon... All right. All right. $520, since it's an election year and all. I understand that tempers are a little bit high-strung. Her daughter! Can you believe that? Of course, dolt. That little Eddie brat must've been the one that took Ava. This presents an interesting situation, indeed. I don't get it, slayton. Why are we asking them for help? I thought we had to find Ava. No, murph. We merely need to find her first. Works to our advantage. One of these backwater bohunks finds our dearly dead Ava after US, then the whole town could be our alibi. So, then... How do you suppose we secure our success in this venue? Before the hubblites? Beats me. My thoughts, exactly. I got it. I got it. We could use the big Turner girl to help US smoke out the little Turner girl. Eureka! There's been a miracle! Someone is capable of deductive reasoning! Alert the media. Murphy, you can sit in the front. Why do I have to get in the back? Deputy: Sheriff, sheriff, sheriff! Sheriff here. This is deputy Michael. Michael? Yes. Where are you now? Well, I'm at the north end of town, sheriff. Good. I was wondering if I could trade places with Carl at the south end of town. What the hell for? Well, I got to go to the bathroom real bad, sheriff. And I know there's a really clean bathroom at that gas station... Hold your position, Michael. For Pete's sake, keep your eye out for little Eddie. Sheriff out. Man: Sheriff? Yes. Sheriff here. Sheriff, this is Hank. Hank? Yeah. I'm over at the 7-Eleven. Yes? And I got a burrito, but the microwave here is busted. I was wondering if I could go home and heat it up. What are you doing at the 7-Eleven? Well, you told me to stick to the middle of town, so I figured 7-Eleven's just as good a place as any. Sheriff out! Oh, Clay. Do you see any sign of him? No. But he, uh, he couldn't have gone far. He can't move that fast. Ok. Come on, Clay. Hurry. What? Ava. Come on. You go that way. I'll go this way. Ok. Bye. Ava! Like the back of your hand, huh? Sorry. We've been all over this area. Where could that pachyderm have gone? That pachyderm happened to be my only friend. You've got to help me find him before slayton gets to him. Nothing's going to happen while I'm around. What are you, Robin hood? Don't you think that your parents might be a little worried about you about now? My dad died. My mom? Probably doesn't even know I'm gone. Guess I know how you feel. You don't know how I feel. No one knows how I feel. I just lost my only friend, and I have no family. So, you think you're the only one? Want to hear a story? Do I have a choice? My father died, too, when I was young, and it was too hard for my mom to take care of me and my brothers by herself, so we got split up, and I got sent to an orphanage, where I stayed until I was 16. Hmm. Kind of like that Oliver guy. That's right. What happened at 16? I ran away. Did you ever see your family again? No. Can I tell you something I didn't tell you last night? Just so that there are no secrets between US. Sure. I broke out of prison to get here. What was the matter? Didn't like the food? Ha ha. No. Seriously, Clay. What if they catch you? Don't know. I had to. I have no choice. I got to settle the score. Well, you know I meant what I said about helping you with slayton. And I meant what I said. I don't want you near that snake. He'd do more than hurt Ava to get just what he wants. I can't take that risk. Why not? 'Cause I think you're pretty wonderful to think about more than just yourself. Thanks, Clay. Did we come this way? No. We went that way. [Mumbling] This elephant. I know this elephant. If this car breaks down, I'm gonna hit you! Man: Sheriff... Sheriff here. Sheriff, I'm lost. Wait a minute. Is this... is this who I think it is? Yes? The kid... the kid that eats potato chips all the time? Yeah. Evan? Yeah. Follow the crumbs. Colleen... I never hired these guys for their I.Q., but the odds of them all being wrong is mind boggling. Mind boggling. He's big. I mean, really big. He's so big, he's fat. That's it. He's fat. What am I saying? He's fat. And he's got little, tiny, squinty brown eyes. They're knowing eyes, but they're not telling, and what they're telling, they're not knowing. All right. And they also have... oh, let's see. He's got a big nose, like a hose. A hose nose. Ooh. Just a long nose. He's got these big things coming out underneath. They're like giant teeth. And he's got a little, tiny, swarthy tail, right by his hindquarters. He's an elephant. Perfect. That's exactly what I was saying. Great. Ok. Print up 500 of these things, and circulate them through the town. And put them up in the voting booths, too. And while you're at it, be sure to write "missing" all over it. Got it? Got it. Good. All right. Go. Whew. Oh, boy. Me, once again. What am I doing? I should be going to make sure he does it right. Uh-huh. Ok. Trouble in paradise? Well, as far as I can see, 6 of our men are in different states, and 3 don't know where they are, and Brian is having a little trouble with the officials at the Canadian border. Ehh. What's going on outside? I'm arranging a last-minute debate between you and me, this way, the voters will know the issues the day of the election. Are you out of your mind? I'm like a fox. I have more important things to do than worry about your media spectacle. Ha ha. You're afraid. You're really asking for a knuckle sandwich, aren't you? No, but a cup of coffee and a piece of pie wouldn't break my heart. Oh! Colleen... I heard that, Mr. Mayor. Oh, you did, didn't you? You know what I want. I thought blueberry. Ooh. Good. Are you registered? Of course. To vote, I mean. Ha ha ha ha. Sheriff: Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! What's going on here? What are you people doing? Mayor: Can't you see this woman is avoiding the issues? What is the issue, George? I thought it was about a little girl lost in the woods. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? [Whistles] Ladies and gentlemen! I need your help. Help me to find my lost child as well. [Sobbing] Please, help bring her back to the ones who love her. Sheriff, your words last night affected me deeply. I could hardly sleep a wink. I beg your pardon? I want to help organize a search party for both missing children. Well, that's very generous of you, Mr. Slayton. But as we speak, I have 10 trained professionals out there in the field. Yes. I'm aware of that, but I still think my services in this endeavor will be invaluable on your efforts. Oh, Leona, let's give it a try. You know, strength in numbers. One for the gipper, and all that. Well... Plus, I'm going put, uh, let's see. Uh... Uhh... Oh. Uh... no. I'm going to put $60... My own money... Into that $600 reward. And I will hold that $60 in my own pocket, for safe keeping. Is there a reward for the child? $1,000 to anyone who finds my daughter. [Cheering] And I will personally see to it that $1,000 will be kept in safety with that $60. So, uh, 1,560 is the total in rewards? Very good, hooner. Did you figure that out by yourself? No bonus for both? It's not a bake sale. What about the escaped guy? Yeah, well... Any money on him? Don't get too cerebral, hooner. Just... I just thought i'd give it a shot. I understand. And so, in conclusion... Oh! Oh! Let me say, in this election, you and only you have the choice. Like this fork, we are at the fork roads of our town. We can go high, or we can go low. We'll be... we'll be very... come in handy. For the winning of this election. And I thank you. And... what are you doing? What... what? Didn't I tell you I want you to heat that up? Hooner, hooner... Ok. We've looked everywhere. Any ideas? Well, maybe if we saw things the way he did. Eddie... Be careful. Eddie! Eddie! Be careful. Ok. I'm just trying to get his eye level. What do you see? See anything? No. Not yet. There he is! He's heading towards town. Come on. Let's go. Hurry up! Mr. Mayor, i'm sorry to interrupt you. I just thought you'd want to know that... Little checkers is back! Get that dirty mutt out of here! Get out! Also, uh, Mrs. Glasscock called, and she said that, uh, little Kevin's bike is back, too. [Grumbling] I'm real sorry about your hexagon thing. All I wanted to do was put a little energy back into this great town of ours. Disappearing elephant. Everything disappearing. We could turn this into a supernatural wonderland! I was sure they'd buy it. I know I did. You did, didn't you? You really did. [Sobs] Now, look, now, you got to remember you can't be down in the dumps about this thing. You got to keep your sunny side up, huh? Remember, we still have those election results to look forward to. [Mumbling] [Telephone ringing] Hello. Mayor's house. It's the widow yeats. Cat's back. Ohh! [Sobbing] Eddie! Hello, there! Looking for... what's the brat's name? Eddie? That's right. Do you know where she's at? Do you know? Get in the car. I don't think so. I do! Now, hop in. Lady! Get in the car. Norman... Get in the back. Why do I have to get in the back? It's always "Norman, get in the back." "Norman, pay for the pizza." "Norman, Lance the boil on my..." Oh, that's enough! What're you doing this for? What am I doing this for? Look, lady, it was your little brat Eddie that took my elephant in the first place. Oh, sure! Sure! My little 70-pound daughter stole your 900-ton elephant! Yeah, right! Well, she could have. Yeah, and unless we get a dead elephant carcass back to the fairgrounds by today, we won't collect a huge insurance check! Thanks for the update, Norman. [Engine cranking] Problem with the car? The rule is, Norman, you use my car... aah! You put gas in it! I couldn't put gas in it, because I didn't have any money! Aah! I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you later. [Engine cranking] [Engine sputtering] Ah-ha ha! Onward! Into the fog! [Sneezes] [Engine cranking] [Engine sputters] Stop! Aah! Ok. We've been down there. Came from here. We were over there. We've been over there. Where is she? Where is she? If I knew where she was, I wouldn't be out looking for her to begin with. That makes sense. Oh! To someone who's senseless! Can you go a little faster? We haven't got much time. Jesus Christ. There's nothing. Let's go. Look in here. All the way in. [Whistling] Nothing. Nothing. It's not going to be here. It's not going to be here. Why don't you just move ahead? Look in, and let's go. Go. She got some stuff in there. If that's not an elephant, i'm not interested. Come on. Let's go. Keep moving. Keep moving. Time is money. It's taken care of. Taken care of. I'll take it home. I'll let it sleep in my kitchen. Holy smoke. It's an elephant. That it is. How'd that disappear? You're right! What? Oh! Come on. There he is! There's my Ava. [Trumpets lightly] Ava! Told you we'd find him. Eh, Carl. Nice of you to take care of him while I was away. Clayton, is that really you? In the flesh. I came back to settle the score. And take back what's mine. That's the best news I've had all year. Don't you worry about Ava. I'll take good care of him. Well, come on! Let's go! You just take care of slayton. You bet I will. The rules, Norman. Rules! Rule number one, you take-a my car. Rule number 2, you fill it with-a gas! I couldn't fill it with gas. I don't have any money! Oh! You, I swear I'm gonna kill! Cut it out! We got to find my daughter! Kill! Hey, dork ball, pick on someone your own size. Eddie! Hi, mom. Norman! Norman, wake up! Eddie! Aah! No! No! Help me! No! No! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Help! Help! Won't somebody get me out of here? Please! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Get me out of this trunk! How can I get you out of the trunk? Press the button! Press the button! Aah! Thank you. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Slayton: Where are you looking, you idiot? She's coming around the tent. Just tell me when you see her come around the tent. No, don't whistle. Just tell me when you see her, you idiot. It's gonna be a surprise. Don't you get it? I'm gonna jump out and grab her! Shut up and get in the can. Shut up! Shut up, Norman. [Thwack] Norman: Oh! Hi, Eddie. Eddie... wait. Wait. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Eddie... [Whispering] Eddie, come here. Eddie... Eddie, Eddie, it's so nice to see you. Eddie, where is my elephant? What elephant? What do you mean, what elephant, little girl? Where is my Ava? Claude! You looking for something? Oh, that's... Clayton? Clay... Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay. Stop it. Where ya been, baby? [Chuckles] Ow! Jail, Claude. Oh, of course, jail! He's been in jail. Oh! How could I forget? You know we were in a bit of a bind. What would you have me do? Oh, I don't know. Maybe not lie on the witness stand. Me? Lie? Ow. Ok, Eddie, you're out of here. I don't think so! [Grunts] Ow! Let her go. No. Now, don't tell me you acquired a conscience while you were in prison. Oh, no. I find that an awful bore. Yes, a horrible commentary on the state of the human condition. Such a fine specimen of criminal mentality and aggression softened. Why, you've even developed an apparent code of morals. Stop it! Well, under the... Enchanting influence of such a... stop it! Stop it! Infectious little street waif such as her. I said let her go! What a pity. Stop it! Oh! Well, Norman... Get out of the way, or i'm gonna have to shoot you as well! No, slayton. This is between you and Clayton. [Growls] Ha ha! Ha ha! Heh heh. Slayton and Clayton, huh? Oh, yes. Ready to relive the good old days. Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages... Ah! No, Clay! Clay, no! No! Come on. This is one of those challenges that life throws you. You gotta rise up to meet it! Yes. Rise up. A year and a half of my life is gone. Oh, time goes by, and what happens? Clay: The partnership's gone. Eddie: Clay, this is one of those challenges. A year and a half of my life ain't gone for nothing. Eddie: Look, slayton, just tell the truth. Say you planned it out. Be honest for once. Ugh. Ok. Say it! I lied. I lied! I lied, I lied, I lied! Lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied! Ok? I lied. Eddie! Right now, I have 5 trained deputies with their sights set... Right on you. Slayton: Oh, well, folks. It's showtime. Oh, for the love of god! Come on! Put me out of my misery! Oh! Someone... Oh, god, end this waking nightmare. [Toy gun firing] [Slayton crying] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Now, just wait a minute. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I was just fooling. It was just... It was just a joke. A joke. What have I done? Well, let's start with attempted murder and work on down from there. Move it, big boy! Oh, god. Help! Oh, good riddance to bad rubbish. [All chattering] [Slayton shouting] Clayton... I'm sure glad you're gonna be running things from now on. Thank you. Thank you, buddy. It's good to be home. It's good to be home. What's with all the clowns, Leona? Well, after returning all the things they lifted, they've got a lot of community service hours to work off. You better get used to seeing them. You're gonna see a lot of them. What's gonna happen to Clay, Leona? Breaking out of prison is no joke, Eddie. But in light of the new evidence, and my testimony and Norman's, they're gonna review Clay's case. Is he gonna go to jail? Oh, no way. No way, no way. Come over here. Hooner: The results are in! The results are in! The results are in! And I am very happy to say... It is my pleasure... Now, the winner of the mayorial election is... And the winner is... George: Yes? Heh heh. Thank you. Leona hubble. What? Let me... You mean, I... I resign! [Whooping and cheering] I guess I could get used to a bigger booth. [Laughter] [People cheering and chattering] Eddie: Did you see that? Slayton confessed in front of the whole town. And they took him away. Last thing I heard, he was upstate making license plates. The mayor finally decided that helping Leona run the town was better than doing nothing. Yeah, even hooner joined in and helped the both of them. And as you probably guessed, Leona turned out to be the best mayor and sheriff the town ever had. And believe me, she taught the whole town a lesson. Sometimes the best man for the job is actually a woman. And I, for one, am happy to say Jeff-freak finally dropped out of the picture. And mom and I, we went back to being best friends. Colleen took over the diner for Leona and finally tied the knot with hooner. Clayton and the clowns decided to stay in hubble. They turned the circus into a real show. I don't think anything in hubble will ever be the same. At least, I hope not. And as for Ava and me, we're working on our own act. And I got a feeling this is just the beginning.
