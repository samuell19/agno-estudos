Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. It is You we worship and You we ask for help. Guide us to the straight path. The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked Your anger or of those who are astray. Hello, Sermin. I'm at a prayer. I'll be there soon, hang up. What are we eating? We have bulgur salad, stuffing, and Circassian chicken. If they're not enough, I have stuffed goat meat for you, it's great. Just hang up before I get mad. We're praying here. Hang up. -...who can intercede with Him. -I'm so sorry, hodja. Let's continue. He knows what is presently before them -and what will be after them. -Mukerrem, let's go to the living room. What if something happens? Just stay here. You're crazy, we'll be right there. If she dies, we'll hear her anyway. Come on. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. Mukerrem, this is my seventh visit here. Even the mosque is so tired of you that they sent a different hodja. We just goof off. This is not working. Okay, you're right, but what am I supposed to do? I can't believe this. I told you, she was moving like she'd die at any moment. Her whole body was shaking, legs, arms, even her little fingers were throbbing. I saw the whites in her eyes, what was I supposed to do? We know she loves you very much. She made you take an oath to be with her in her last moments. I know, Mukerrem. I'll fulfill my oath. I love her so much, too. She was my milk-mother. But I have paid my debt for suckling! Maybe she can't die just because all you girls gather around her. You just eat bulgur salad and lentil balls, then burp in her face. She's supposed to breathe her last, but the room smells of lentils and onions. How could someone go to the afterlife like that? Please! Yes, you're right. It's very simple. Get a mirror in front of her face. If you don't see fog, call me. -Okay. -All right, I'm out. -Say hi for me. -Thanks. A beautiful day in Güreştepe. My sweet neighborhood! I'm approaching you. Open your arms and embrace me! I hope you enjoy sitting down. Oh, yes. Kids are running, I like the attention. Be careful, don't trip. Peace be with you. Hello, there. Tall buildings! My old neighbors! Hello! -Are you guys fighting? -I'm so tired of him. Don't be, it's not easy to find a husband. If you don't get along, just don't push it. Go on, my lovely people. More power to you. A lonely and unhappy woman. Wait a second, are you going to cook green beans for dinner? Don't be lazy, try to remove the strings. Keep it tasty. Hello, you look like a matching couple. But he needs to wear something ice blue, too. Keep polishing it, that woven shirt will make you sweat now. It's too thick. What is it now? Have you kept that tree since New Year's Eve? What shade of green is that? Zerrin, what do you think about my dress? Is it good? Very good, it looks great on you. Those colors make you shine. Sir, you've gone beet red because of the heat, wear a hat. It's hot. Everything is lovely, except that lady. You know it's not looking good, right? I swear I'll change. You'll never make it, look at those shoes. A lovely father-daughter duo. Even though I have had an urban renewal, I'm still with you. My luxurious living, the life I deserve. Here I come! Wait for me! -Fazil, wait a second. Fazil, stop! -Alright. Sir, do you live in this building complex? -Excuse me? -Wait a second, I'm going there. Can you move your car right now? -I'll be here for just two minutes. -Look, this is my area. Okay? I own 13 flats here. So I have the right to park 26 cars here. Even if I don't park here, why are you taking up this space? -Go back. Go back quickly. -Okay. Pass it to me! Give it here! Kids, play in your own block. Don't make me take away your ball. What do you use to wipe the floors, Mr. Idris? I use Permola, it smells so nice. You have to use something to polish the marble. Talk to the building manager and use something good. Don't make me punish you, I can make all the tenants rise against you. Okay, Sister Zerrin. "Sister"? Mr. Idris, Ms. Zerrin. Get used to the residence culture already! -Okay, Ms. Zerrin. -Obviously, we just have urban renewal. But there is zero mental renewal. You'll never feel the luxury residence vibe, what a waste! God. Don't think that fashion is wearing something that suits you. Fashion is being able to go beyond your style, do you get it? For example, they say you can't wear a zebra print over a leopard print. No way, you can wear them nicely. Actually, the best combinations are done like this, look. The deadly blow. A belt with stones. I'm officially dominating Bakirkoy's fashion world singlehandedly. They talk behind my back, about how Zengo is an old maid. They'd better come see this old maid now. If I ask a married woman to leave her husband and live with me, she would leave her husband and live with me. They're just waffling, anyway. Who cares? They say that money has spoiled me. Yes, it has spoiled me so well. I'm so happy to be spoiled. I wish everyone could be spoiled like this. Who cares? I've been put to the test by money, my life's been so tough. They've been put to the test by poverty. How could you be tested by poverty? That means you don't have anything. How could one be tested with absence? But it's so hard to be tested by money. Get the door, there is someone at the door. -Get the door. -Okay. Also, your existence has been testing my patience. -What was that? -I feel suffocated. Welcome then, come in. Sister, we're exhausted. What's wrong with you? You're all out of breath. The elevator is broken. It's not broken, Sermin. It's under maintenance. This is a residence, we take care of what we have. But we climbed up to the 13th floor, for God's sake. I'm at the peak. It is hard to live here. Come on in, don't mess around. Now everyone will form teams, make a combination, and explain where it'll be worn, okay? Try designing it now. Use your imagination. Go on then, speed up. -Are we ready, girls? -We are. -Go on, Soner, start with the intro. -Here it is. Chickens that wander inch by inch This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Have you ever been lynched? Kiss your style goodbye inch by inch This is the Copper Village Bakirkoy the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Sister Emine, you're first. Where do you plan to go in those clothes? I'll be visiting the British Consulate. -To the Consulate? -I need to get a passport. Sister Emine, do you know what your T-shirt says? It says "fok." -"Fok"? -Fok, like a seal. A fish. Emine, I bought you that T-shirt to make things better between you and your husband. You never wore it when he was alive. But once he died, you wear nothing but that T-shirt. It's so comfortable, my sweet Zerrin. Emine, soon, you'll get harassed because of that T-shirt. It's like an invitation. I'm saying this only because I respect your old age. You don't deserve it at all, actually. -It was squeezed out of me. That's all. -Okay, thank you. Alright, come over, Sermin. Where do you plan to go in that, Sermin? I'm a superhero. Protector of the oppressed, savior of the weak. Sermin, every week, we say you're not supposed to wear tights, right? -Yes. -Why do you keep wearing tights, Sermin? Turn around and show your ass. You really make me mad. Here, let your friends see that, too. Your ass is sweaty. Look, your ass is crying. And it actually speaks, it's saying, "Sermin, don't put me in tights, please! I can't fit in them. I can't live in them!" For God's sake, please go sit down. Every week, the same thing happens. Semanur, it's your turn. Semanur, will you ever behave? What kind of person are you? What's up with those weird moves? This is me being natural. You said I was supposed to pose. Where do you plan to go in that? I plan to go to a masquerade, wear a mask, and walk in a forest. Then, I'll see a big mansion. I'll knock on the door and see a butler. He'll ask me for the password. I'll say, "Fidelio!" Then, they'll open the gates. I'll go inside and see 150 men. And they're all naked, butt-naked. They all have huge beaks. Then suddenly, someone will pull my arm. I'll say, "No, you can't do it!" Suddenly, they'll start to peck. What will I do? Well, I better not tell the rest. Semanur, what kind of psycho are you? What kind of fantasy world is this? What's this estrogen explosion about? What's going on with you? Why can't you live like normal people? You see? -You're completely empty. -Please, now. That's enough, you all bore me. You all totally disgust me! Your turn, Meltem. What's up with you now? Where do you plan to go in that? I'll be going to the court for my sister-in-law's divorce. Is it in the military court, Meltem? What's your role in the trial? Will you be a general or Napoleon Bonaparte? Forget about it, for God's sake. Girls, I don't think I can teach you how to be stylish. I just can't do it. Listen, I'm doing this as a hobby. If I get mad, I might shut down this class completely. You can be stylish with little touches. For you girls to see, I'll show you myself, look. Now I have this, you see? I can feel it now, to the bone, look at this. I can experience a big speculation and fermentation, look. You don't need to spend a lot to be stylish. A little bit of money, like 5,000 or 10,000 dollars, would be enough to be stylish. That doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Now the final blow is coming, look. I'm wearing the shoes. Here. Red stilettos, why? Confidence, look. I'm quiet, but the shoes say, "There is a woman here, a woman is coming." -So, what is it now? Who are we? -We're the people! We're the people, right? The people. And what about my clothes? Extremely stylish. So what do we have now? We synthesize and contrast the people and the style. -Right. -What does it say? Public Fusion. This is my motto. This is how we'll live from now on. -Exactly. -Yes. Public Fusion. Let the jealous ones go and screw themselves. -Excuse my French. Alright? -Yes. Alright, then. Change your clothes. This is the last class. I'm supposed to visit Fazilet anyway, that's enough already! Alright, next week, I want you to show up with something much more fancy. Don't let me down. -Okay. -Okay, Zerrin. The elevator was under maintenance. You see, it works now. Let me take you down on the elevator, so you can feel the luxury. That would be lovely. Even the elevator tries to take care of itself. Come on in. You see how comfy and spacious it is? You just need to push a button to go to the floor you want. -Completely luxurious. -Luxurious. I always say that people should spoil themselves sometimes. My god! Did someone step on something? Sister, my bag! Fazil! Fazil! -Girls, wait a second! -What happened? Wait a second! Is there anyone who can see us? Wait a second! I can't even feel my panic because of you! Stop! Security! Can anyone hear us? We're stuck here, security! They can't see us! The elevator is broken because of your evil eyes! This is jealousy. Idris! Mr. Idris, where are you? What is that smell? Sister Emine? I don't smell anything, Zerrin. What are you talking about? If you don't smell anything, then it must be you! -No, I didn't do anything. -It smells like the odor's -been building up over the years! -I swear I didn't do it. This isn't the time. I swear to choke you before the elevator gets you! Mr. Idris! You were wiping the stairs, where are you now? Are you there? Idris! He heard us. We're stuck in the elevator. Okay! We'll open the doors. -Come on, brother. Come on. -Okay. Listen, in rescue operations, fat ones always go first. To avoid any danger. Come on, Sermin. -I'm just big-boned. -Come on, Sermin! On three! Come on now, Sermin! Move! Move! It's not working! No way, she's not moving. Get down, Sermin. I got her. Take me, then. My life is more precious, anyway. Come on. Try harder. Come on. -You're tearing my clothes! -It's torn up! Just pull me, goddamn you! Pull me! Good, try to tear it up more! Are you happy now? -Help me up. -Come on. I just can't catch a break because of you guys! Let them stay there, don't save them. -Zerrin, what did we do? -Come on, Zerrin! Stay there! What a joke! You're wonderful as always! My dearest friend. Fazilet, I was just wondering where that cheap prostitute perfume spreading all over the neighborhood was coming from. Now I know. Turn on the air conditioner, so we can get rid of the smell of infamy, hypocrisy, and denial. Okay, Zerrin, I already turned it on, but now... Go ahead and turn it on, my sweet friend, you know why? When I came here earlier, it was so fresh inside, but then a disgusting and disastrously sickening smell's taken over the place. I wonder why. -Are you taking a jab at me? -Zerrin, don't. Do you think you're my match? You uncultivated mushroom. Does anyone recognize you in the neighborhood? Nobody recognizes you because of the plastic surgeries you've had. Sweet Zerrin, I'll try explaining how far better I am, okay? Calm down and listen to me. Now, sweetie. You're a high card in poker, and I'm a royal flush. With that look of yours, the best thing you could do is lead a halay dance, but I would be a primadonna in La Scala. You're a fried egg with garlic sausage and I'm a poached egg with avocado. Don't, no. Let me boil some eggs in your head so your brain can get some protein. No, dear. Thanks, I just ate. I almost forgot to ask you this, you know. What happened to your arm, girl? Did a pit bull bite you? Did a rhino chase you? Or did you try to do something stylish? Tell me. This is my new style. People Fusion. But you can't know about the people since you've forgotten about your roots. You're now used to passing judgment and using your husband's money. Girl, you retina killer! At least I have a husband! What about you? All four of your fiancés dumped you. Remember? I remember that I showed no mercy and dragged you by your hair in the city hall. If I beat you up again, not even ten surgeons can fix your face! Hey! No contact! Fazish, take that thing away from me. -I'm willing to use violence now! -Don't, Zerrin. I feel schizophrenic, take me away from here. Either take me away from here or call an ambulance. So impudent. -How many times did I tell you? -What did you tell me, Zerrin? -What was the laughter about? -Who laughed? -You've never been playful, even with me. -Don't say that. Do you have a foot in both camps? You know someone called Graham? Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you tell me she was here? Look, I have always supported you, both financially and morally, okay? And don't get me wrong, I never rub it in. I can help you anytime you want. But don't be ungrateful to me. How could you forget so easily? Don't you remember what she did to us? She ruined our childhood and adolescence. Do I have to remind you of this every time? Just try to remember. Hello, I'm a strawberry. I grow in spring. I taste very nice and my color is beautiful. Everybody likes me very much. Hello, I'm a lentil. I grow all year long. I'm totally useless. I just make you fart. And I resent my teacher for making me a lentil. Hello, my friends, I'm an onion. I'm not happy at all, I cry all the time. Don't cry, stupid. At least you have a buddy. Lentil and onion, we're a team. You see that? If it wasn't for us, she couldn't go up. It's not her fault, the teacher asked us to do that, what can we do? Fazilet, you're so naive. I'll lose my mind. Ma'am, Zerrin won't stop moving. -What? -Tell me the answer to the third question. No way, I'm against cheating. Do it yourself. What's going on there? Ma'am, Zerrin asked me for the answers. Fazo. This is so unfair, Fazo! So unfair! Do you now remember what she did to us? She ruined our lives. Zerrin, goddamn me! Don't curse. Even at yourself. You're a good friend of mine, I may get harmed too. -This will kill me. -Okay? Make a choice. Her or me? -You. -Say it again. -You. -Look into my eyes and say it. -You! -Then you have to appreciate me! -Get her out of here. -Right now. Kick that damned one out of here. -Okay. -I'll be waiting here. Fazilet, I completely forgot to tell you, I just remembered. I need to go right now. I need to be in a fashion show, you know. -I need to prepare for that. -God, help me. -Some of us have harder lives, you know? -Protect my sanity! Successes bring wonderful successes. See you later, baby. See you, too, my past. Let me see you off to the neighborhood, I'm sure you don't remember the way. I'm shaking! Get me some water, Fazo. -Enjoy it, girls. -Thanks. Bless your hands. This is really tasty, by the way. Bless your hands. -Dear Fazilet, this is so nice. -I cooked it with love. Fazo is good at cooking, but I wish she'd only let decent people in her shop. -What do you mean? -Who came? Menkibe came to the shop. What a shameless girl. Exactly. We started quarreling. I hardly contained myself. I was very tempted to beat her up. -But I didn't. -I think you should have hit her, sister. -I agree. -No, it's beneath me. -Fazilet, it's your fault. -Why, Sister Emine? How so? -Why didn't you call Zerrin? -She's right. I could have, Sister Emine. Yes, I could have, but I didn't. Menkibe dropped by so unexpectedly. You couldn't because you are passive, a loser. And you don't have confidence. Your mother was just like you. She was a loser. You have a low IQ, you know? I can't understand how you studied and managed to become a tailor. -Sister Emine? -Yes? -I'm holding a pot of boiling water. -Be careful, don't burn your hand. -So you don't want any more? -No, thanks. You're welcome, Sister Emine. You're most welcome. Zerrin! He's shouting again. Zerrin! What is it, Muzo? I closed the shop and was leaving, but I heard you girls talking. I could bring you some pastrami. Who needs pastrami now? We're having some pastries and tea. -I would like to have some tea. -There is none. -I might bring some sausage. -Eat your own sausage. Well, you know what I mean, you know we're neighbors. That's what I mean. I can see your heart, okay. He's so clingy. Zerrin, he has a big crush on you. He's in a blazing fire. Then he'd better call the fire department. Look at these pictures. Again, I can see who's my enemy and who's my friend. Half of my social circle didn't bother to like my pictures. I couldn't get in the "discover" section again. Enjoy it, sister. Take a picture of me. Look, this is the concept. A rich woman is eating calf ham. -Got it? -Yes. Are you done? Look now, some rich and unhappy woman is having brunch. Got it? Are you taking pictures? -Yes. -Wonderful, let me see. This is so natural, if I post it on Instagram, I'll get at least 32 likes. -May I ask something? -You may. May I stop wearing this? Of course not, Selma! Have you ever seen a housemaid who isn't wearing a lace headband? A proper housemaid should wear an apron and a lace headband. You're lucky I don't make you wear stuff like those Mexican or Guatemalan maids. Try to go beyond yourself, from now on, I want a professional attitude here. -Go inside now. -Okay. Look at the way she walks. Everything about you is wrong. Here, Fazo is calling, a real friend. She can feel what I'm going through. -Yes, Fazo? -What are you doing, Zerrin? You know me. I'm having brunch, eating some ham. What branch? I'm at home, having breakfast, Fazo! Turn on the TV and watch the Fashion Channel. What is it about? Are they talking about us? Just turn it on. Okay, I'm turning it on, wait a second. Just tell me what's on the TV, you sound so nervous. Wait. ...mysterious. Why did you ruin my breakfast for that greedy dog, Fazo? Just listen. Hang up! You're mocking me for fun, just hang up. Empty people, empty words. In short, I call it Public Fusion. What do you call it? Excuse me, can you repeat it? Public Fusion. What a creative and unique name. Did you come up with that name? I did. And you know what? I have had a sketchbook since childhood. Look, I have it with me now. My initial. Pretty modest stuff as you can see. My sketchbook! Is it really yours? Of course, it is. Whose else could it be? She stole my sketchbook! I have been looking for it for two days! I thought I left it in Fazilet's shop! Who do you think you are? You're a thief! You're a worthless dog! You're a lowlife slut! Well, you know, the sky is the limit for my talents, so I couldn't stop myself. Are you talking about talent? What talent are you talking about? Are you unique? Are you the one who is unique? Have you ever done anything in your life? I'll tear myself up! Goddamn you! Thief! I'll break it! But this is too expensive to break for you, it's gilded. I'll beat myself up! My god! Take my life! Don't let me live! I'll lose my mind! Oh, my god! I'll cut myself into pieces! I'm dying! My god, I'm losing it! Let it go, Zerrin, everybody knows what a lowlife she is. Everybody knows, but I'm the one who was robbed. My sense of style got stolen. You just couldn't let me smash her face at the shop, could you? You're a vegetable, Fazo. You were born as a tree and you will die as a tree. You see, now your fruits have been stolen too. May she choke to death on it, greedy shit. She's a thief. She stole your hard work, the designs you created with these legs and calves of yours. I feel abased. I swear I feel like crying, I feel so abased. No more crying! Look, you have the talent, designs, and sketches. She does the sewing. And what does she have? All she can do is steal and show off with her husband's money. Thanks, Sermin. You're wearing tights again. I was in a hurry. That's enough! Enough! I'm done with it! Zerrin! You did the design and I did the sewing, right, Zerrin? Sister! She screwed both you and me! Screwing you means screwing me! Why did she have to screw us both at the same time, Zerrin? Stop it! Don't touch me! -Menkibe! -Don't! -Menkibe! Here you go, Menkibe! -Stop! -Stop that! -Okay, I'm fine! She's always been like that. She's always been a little bit slow. But this is not a problem. Now that Fazo the vegetable has freshened up, I want you all to hear what I have to say. I'll show everyone in Turkey what a scumbag she really is. Mark my words. Menkibe will be exposed soon! Ms. Deniz, can you look here? What would you like to say about the organization? Exelance Magazine has done a great job once again. I think it's a wonderful event. -Mr. Baris, can you look this way? -May I take you here? Good evening, ma'am. May I see your invitation? -Excuse me, what is this? -What is what, ma'am? It's a face, right? My face is the invitation. -Do you know who I am? -No, I don't, ma'am. I'm the wife of the guy who organizes this event, okay? Besides getting you fired now, I could ruin you so badly that you won't even be able to defend yourself. Think with your brain! Cue ball! I'm sorry, ma'am, come on in, please. That's more like it! Be smart! Zerrin, you're really something else. Girl, we're from Bakirkoy, I'm a tough nut from the hood. Zerrin, there are so many people from the press. I hope we're not overdressed. Well, I look really stylish. But honestly, you kind of look like a honky-tonk singer. Do I really? Anyway, come with me, let the exposé begin. Move aside, frilly spangle, you talk too much. -Give me that. -What's going on? Alright, members of the press. Is everyone listening to me? I'm about to give you some explosive news. Are you ready? The woman who is getting an undeserved award right now, who is known as Cansu Ozyollu, is actually called Menkibe Cansu Ozyollu. Here is her high school yearbook. This is proof. We rely on the documents. Alright, the second bomb is coming. -Are you ready? -Stephany is here! Who is Stephany? Where are you going? I'm talking about the facts here. I'm listening to you, ma'am. Get lost! Take this too. It's the same height as you, anyway. Move, Fazilet. We don't need the press. We'll create our own headlines. Let the show begin. Hello, everyone. Behind me, you see the media that loves nothing but show. The thief Cansu Ozyollu is inside. I call her a thief, but nobody cares. Cansu Ozyollu is a thief. She stole our designs. -Ma'am, please move on. -What's going on? Goddamn you all! Corrupt media! Don't touch me, cue ball! I'll kick your ass! -Shame on you all! -Don't raise your hand to me! Shame on you! Girls, what's going on? Do I have to send you texts through WhatsApp groups? Nobody is looking at my face. I'm checking out last night's event. -Is it bad, Fazilet? -No, it's not too bad, don't worry. What do you mean, Fazilet? You disgraced yourselves. Sister Emine, congratulations for always looking on the bright side. Zerrin, that slutty Menkibe posted a story as a response to you two. Let me see. As you know, as I was about to get a wonderful award, I heard the sound of -some unleashed cart horses whinnying. -You dirty greedy dog! And she claimed that I stole her designs or something. Bring it on! Let's see if she can join Fashion Style Days. I'll knock her down to size. Don't bother, sweetie, with your filler lips. Just wait for me, okay? Wait for the champ. You need to have assurance, sacrifice, and self-confidence. So you need to have a tough ass! We have that ass, don't worry. Sermin, turn around. -We have the king of asses! -Bless you, dear. I love you all and I will soon introduce you to my explosive designs. Can't we catch a break from that thief? My dear friend, don't worry, I'll arrange everything. We'll be in Fashion Style Days, you'll see. Sweet Fazilet, you can't even manage this shop, how can you join Fashen Stay Dry? Sister Emine, it's "Fashion Style Days." Well, whatever. We need a qualified, experienced, and professional PR guy. Don't we, Zerrin? She's right. We're facing a slimy hypocrite. We shouldn't be that bad even if we try. We need a slimeball as big as her, but it needs to be a professional. Sermin, you have to find me a qualified and slimy-looking PR guy, okay? Don't worry, I can find one in a second. And don't worry about the money. I have set my mind on it. I'm willing to spend the rent of four of my flats. Fashion Style Days is about to meet the Bakirkoy Copper Village. -Of course. -It is. They've awakened the snake sleeping inside me. I'll be like this from now on. No more Ms. Nice Girl! That's enough! No, I'm not having another fit, don't worry. I'm calm. -Please. -Thank you. You see, Fazo? We're here on time, -but he's nowhere to be found. -Exactly, this is so rude. This is degeneration because of the population. What does degeneration mean, Zerrin? When someone makes lots of money, they think of themselves as somebody. You know I have that, too. But I can control it. I know. Welcome! You know Istanbul is so hot nowadays. I can't live without a pool. I'll be right there. Of course. Is he naked? He's completely naked, Zerrin. He's wearing something but I can't tell what it is. Hello. Hello. This is somewhat unusual. If we knew better, we might have worn something comfier. But anyway. Let us talk about ourselves first. No, you don't need to. Because I already know you. -How so? -The Exelance event. Goddamn you all! Corrupt media! Don't touch me, cue ball! I'll kick your ass! Well, Mr. Advisor, as you can see, I didn't do anything. This is totally a misunderstanding and the media's wrongdoing. Ladies, why are we here? That's why we're here, you're right on the money. We were victimized. That slut Menkibe Cansu Ozyollu stole our designs. And she'll shamelessly participate in Fashion Style Days with our designs. We're here to deal with this injustice. I see, but what do you want me to do? We're here because you can help us. We'll participate in that fashion week. Fashion Style Days? The one organized by Arzuhan? -Did I say something funny, Fazo? -I'm losing it. No way, Zerrin. You guys are serious. Of course, we are. We're the victims. Sweetheart, this is not easy. It's not easy to reach Arzuhan Yabanci. Never mind being able to talk to her, you can't even reach her assistant's third assistant. Arzuhan is the most successful, sophisticated, and wealthiest woman in Istanbul. She dominates the fashion world. No creation comes to life without her approval. She never says anything in vain, she speaks with her eyes. She even got married without the "I do." She goes into a pool and comes out dry. Even the number of breaths her assistants will take is pre-determined, it's in their contracts. My point is, this is not as easy as you might think. But I can bury that mess. God bless your soul, please help us. -But there is this condition. -What is it? I need to check our astrological charts. If there is a match, then we can work. Of course, you can check it, we have been tested and we come out clean. I have a small goiter problem, but it's under control. Tell me your birthdays. April 22, 1986 and April 24, 1986. We were born two days apart. Our mothers made a deal for that. I hope it is nothing serious. It really looks like a zoo, all the animals are here. The Taurus screws the Leo, the Cancer screws the Scorpio. -Everyone screws each other. -Nobody stops them? But obviously, we have a match, so we can work. Thank god, we really hope so. But as you can see on the wall, I'm a pretty expensive advisor. -How much? -3,000. -For a month? -For a week. Zerrin, if it's 3,000 for a week, then that's 12,000 for a month. Is that right? 12,000 Turkish liras for a month? No, 12,000 euros. -Euros? -But I can make it dollars for you. Listen to me, honey, just don't make us deal with euros or dollars, okay? Just fix it at 15,000 Turkish liras so we can work in the future, too. I saw at least 20 advisor's offices on my way here. They have no customers, so they just advise each other. But sweetie, believe me, 15,000 won't cut it. Honey, what do you mean "it won't cut it"? You act like a shark ready to screw us. It's not open heart surgery or anything. You'll just give us a career improvement. We're the victims here, man. Show some understanding. You know what, when you said you're the victims, you hit me right here. You just pulled my heart out. 15,000 Turkish liras it is. Thank god. Now, we need to find you a catchy brand name. -What's your name? Fazilet. -I'm Fazilet. And I'm Zerrin, they call me Zengo, thanks to my wealth. "Zengo" is nice, now we need to get "Fazilet" to match with "Zengo." Fazy and Zengo. How great is this? Awesome! Fazy and Zengo! Lift it a bit more. Keep lifting. -It looks lovely, so luminous. -Make it even with that corner. Stop now. Fix it there now. Zengo, are you getting a new signboard for the tailor shop? Neon and stuff. Yeah, do it. You have a shitload of money, anyway. -I am not jealous or anything. -Who is she, anyway? -He's dying. -Mr. Advisor! Now you see who she is! My brain was pierced! -The whole neighborhood! -What happened to my head? -Is it bleeding? -No, it's not. -Idiot! You should've been careful! -The rope snapped. Let me get you some ice. That thickhead pierced my brain! Look at me! I can see neon lights flashing in my brain! Aren't you ready yet? Hurry up! -Ladies, what the hell is that? -This is our style. Public, Fusion. Public Fusion. Is that what you've been calling design? I swear, my eyes are bleeding. You look like messy gift boxes. Can't you see the combination and understand what I reflect? What is this? The chintz worn by our mothers and grandmothers for generations. I take it and put it on my pocket. What is this? An angel. So what do we have now? Zengo's Secret. Who can think of this but me? What the hell is Zengo's Secret? This is not working. I did the sewing, but she designed them. So this is not my style, it's not reflecting me. -Well... -Listen to me. You trifling advisor. You can't criticize my sense of style, okay? I give you money by the bucket. You're obliged to advertise my designs. Don't be a wise-ass and stop showing off. Fine, then! I won't mess with your style. But you won't mess with my PR strategies. If you want to be a good brand, first, you need to take care of your figures and try to be icons, right? Zerrin? Look at you. Do you eat whales for breakfast? Do you nibble on seals? What have you been doing, Zerrin? How could someone get so fat? What about you, Fazilet? Look at you! You've collapsed into your body! You look like a locust bean. Are you obsessed with grief? What's up with those dark circles? Are you Kibariye's mother? You have a mean tongue now. Sibel Can used to be chubby too. Turkan Soray has never been thin, but she's always been the Sultana. Nope, it can't be like that. I need to send you to Fit and Fit Ercan. What is Fik Fik? We're two single ladies, so don't send us to a weird place. What "Fik Fik" are you talking about? I said "Fit and Fit." Fit Ercan. It's an exclusive weight loss and detox center. -Here. -Thanks, Fazil. It's a lovely place. -Welcome. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello. Welcome to Fit and Fit. -Thanks. -Thank you. It's a center established to help you regain -your health and self. -How nice. It's sugar-free here. Carb-free also. Of course. We knew that already. So we need to search you for the safety of our guests. We're here as fresh as daisies, I don't think it's necessary. Erdal, can you check the bag, please? You'll see nothing but clothes. We just have tatters and rags. It's just professional deformation as she's a tailor. Fazo! -Ma'am, what is this? -Ma'am, what is this? I'm talking to you. Ma'am, what is this? Then you're talking to me. What's this, ma'am? Well, Fazo, we have been saying that we need to go hungry and get fit, but this is disgraceful. Believe me, I want to apologize to you on my friend's behalf. She just doesn't know, if she did, she wouldn't have done it. She just put me to shame. I'm so sorry, ma'am. This is not the first time we've seen something like that. Erdal. Search her, too. Is this really necessary? Just because she hid something? This is such a prejudice. Please take your hands out of your pockets so I can see them. But, come on. Erdal, search her. I wear so much gold, maybe that's why we're hearing that beeping sound. -See, I'm taking off the gold. -Search her again. Erdal, don't go down. Just don't go down. Of course, it's been happening to me since my childhood. On my birthday, I swallowed some silverware because I was too excited. So I hear that beeping sound everywhere. I always get into trouble in malls and airports. -Unzip your jacket, ma'am. -Okay, let me unzip then. See, nothing. Just look. -It's just gas. -Lift your T-shirt too. Lift it. -Ma'am, what's that? -Baklava. It's completely natural. A six-pack. People work out for years to get it. I did it just by myself. Erdal, destroy the baklava now. Ma'am, I guess you don't understand the mentality of this place. If you don't follow the rules, you'll just need to leave. No, it won't happen again. It was just negligence. Now that you're sugar-free, follow me, please. Just stash it somewhere, I'll get it back after your shift. Ladies, get settled. In half an hour, we'll have a Zumba class. Get ready and come down. Are we not getting any coffee or breakfast? We're so hungry. Zerrin, you made a fool of me. You put those in my bag, didn't you? Forget about that, those guys are complete idiots. They couldn't find one of the stashes although they've searched me. Here are the emergency flares. I hid them under my boobs. They couldn't find these fruit leathers They are all idiots! They are all idiots! I have eyes everywhere. Nothing gets by me. What kind of woman is she? She's like the devil around us. Anyway, I don't want to get stressed. This is a nice facility. Three, two, one. Start with the left foot. Yes, the other one. Go right, hands. You're great. Sir, we're late but we can adjust right now. -Zumba! -You're late, ladies, join the group now. You're great, now forward. Fazo, get this. I'll post a story on Instagram, 15 seconds. Get the most exciting parts. Zumba, Fazo! Zumba, lively! Here comes Tarkan! "Kuzu Kuzu!" -Now right, you're great. -Get the leg. Come on now. Ladies, what are you doing there? We're doing Zumba, sir. -You're ruining the group's rhythm. -Sir, isn't it the Latino fire? We let our fire out. That's how I let my fire out. -Keep up with the group, okay? -Okay. Alright, continue all together. Left foot forward. -Yes. -Come on, Fazo. -Fazo, the snake. -Now to the left. Even the dead are dancing in their graves now. What do you think you're doing? -We're dancing, sir. -You're ruining the group. Sir, have you ever checked the group? Half of them are lame or can't move, they don't have any rhythm anyway. -How could we ruin them? -Please, leave my class now. Nobody wants to be criticized. The choreography is terrible. You just can't feel the rhythm. It's not working. Let's go, Fazo. -Zerrin, you go too far. -This is ridiculous. I could eat a horse, Fazo. I feel like dying, I'll eat everything. -Hello. -Welcome. Let's get our share. Okay. Right, the salad is done. Where is the rest of it? -There is no more. -How come? Mister, soup, starters, warm starters, dessert, where are they? Ma'am, the calorie share is calculated for everyone, so you can't get anymore. You have 178 calories on your plate. This is not nearly enough. She doesn't have a big appetite, give me her share. -How come? -She doesn't get to eat, anyway. She's in the detox program. Only freshly squeezed grass juice for her. Is that so? Thanks? -Are we being mocked here, Fazilet? -I guess we are, Zerrin. -What the hell is this? -Enjoy it. They put a big guy there to stop us from getting more food. What a douche. Let's sit there. We're too rich to suffer like that. At least they gave me a meatball, and you're screwed with grass juice. -They make you eat grass. -This is detox. I'm grateful for the grass, Zerrin. -Enjoy the meal. -Thank you. I guess you don't feel like eating. You haven't touched your meatball. I eat slowly. And I eat so fast. Normally, I eat so fast and a lot. This is my nature. I'll buy your meatball if you want to sell it. Sell what? Look, one bracelet for one meatball. Give it to me. Don't be ridiculous, please. Give it to me. Not enough? Here, two bracelets. -Two bracelets for one meatball, come on. -Stop being ridiculous. -Come on. Take two, give one. Come on. -I swear I'll tell the coach on you. Alright, here is a twisted one for you. Now you have three, come on. Coach. Yes, ma'am, what is going on? She is offering bracelets for my meatballs. -Ms. Zerrin? -Coach, this is a conspiracy. She told me nice things about my gold, so I told her to work hard for them. She's ugly, fat, and a slanderer. Listen, ladies, I don't want to hear anything like that from you two again. Just eat your lunch and follow the rules. -Understood? -Understood. Understood, Coach. I've got my eyes on you, Ms. Zerrin. Just hope I don't find you alone, be careful. Are you threatening me now? I'll talk to the manager now. Who cares? Go to the food engineering department if you like. You ugly fatty. I should have punched you. Enjoy your meal. Fazo, this is not working. I have to make a phone call now, stay here for five minutes. Okay. Hello, Fazil. They starve us here. Some of us have died already. Four people have died. You need to bring me some takeaway. Yes, only for me. Write it, seven lahmacuns, four stuffed meatballs, a double portion meat doner, and a double portion chicken doner. Yes. Bring wraps with cheese and onions with sumac, please. Okay? When you get here, on the first floor, find the room on your right with the open window and throw it in there. Thanks, Fazil. God bless you, Fazil. -Thanks. -Ms. Zerrin, what are you doing here? I'm watching the birds, Ms. Selda. They are so free. The manager is waiting for you, come with me. There is no shortage of trouble here. You're welcome, Ms. Tugce, thank you. You snitch. You know what they do to snitches. Don't drop your soap in the bathroom when you're alone. God forbid! Hello Mr. Manager, how are you? You look very good. I wish I was good, Ms. Zerrin, but we have some problems with you. Like what, sir? The food we found on you the day you came to the camp. Today, you tried to bribe a guest to get her meatballs. Yes. And I don't even want to mention the problems you caused in the classes. Yes, sir. Sir, they throw dirt on me, you know. I tell them not to, but they still do. I couldn't explain myself clearly to them. I said that was the wrong room, but they never listen to me. They just put me in the wrong room. I mean, I'm slandered like that. That's it, sir. Thank you very much for listening to me. Ms. Zerrin, are you okay? Well, sir, thank god I'm okay, but I'm being wronged, you know. What's going on? Who's throwing these? Ms. Zerrin? You have a hand in this, don't you? Look, this is another plot against me. Let me handle it now. Goddamn you, you incompetent prick! -Get the hell out of here! -Okay. Please, stop throwing now! Don't throw food in here, we're trying to lose weight. Please don't do this. Please! Well you see, sir, never mind trying to buy food here, I don't even accept the free ones coming from outside. Ms. Zerrin, in these circumstances, I can't let you stay here anymore. -Please leave the camp immediately. -Am I being kicked out? Let me immortalize your circumstances now. Ms. Zerrin, what are you doing? What is this nonsense about? To hell with your camp! I have seen much better camps in the Swiss Alps. Who cares about your lousy camp? My god, what kind of psychos do we have to deal with here? Breathe in. Breathe out. -Breathe in. -I can't believe this. Get up, Fazo. Let's go. We got kicked out. Ladies, they force you to eat broccoli, but they eat lahmacun in their rooms. The camp manager is exposed! Here! Check it out, ladies. I have a whole feast ready at my place, are you coming with me? Let's go, ladies. Come on! Well, of course, you're supposed to eat. What else can you do? Is there any alternative that will give us pleasure in our lives now? -No. -Screw it. Just eat. Well, it's not like Johnny Depp came to me and I told him, "Sorry, Johnny, but I can't live without eating chocolate pudding." Or it's not like Brad Pitt came and I told him, "Oh, Brad, I can't live without eating baklava." They didn't come. You won't die unhappy if you eat. Everybody regrets not eating. -She's right. -Screw it, just eat. Sister. -Sister, they're taking the sign down. -What's going on, Soner? -Which signboard? -Your tailor shop's signboard, hurry up! Who is taking it down? Fazilet, run! Zerrin! Run! -Are we done with the red tag seal? -Yes, Chief. -Officer! -Brother! -Officer! Wait a minute! -Stop! They already took it down. Why are you taking it down? Ma'am, we're not doing it for nothing. We're taking it down because you've put it up without permission or a license. We were just talking about it at lunch, there is still some syrup on my mouth. We think about nothing but those official papers day and night. Okay, ma'am, but somebody made a complaint against you. Who made a complaint against us? We just live and let live. Ma'am, we can't tell you who. The state keeps such information private. Everyone in the neighborhood has known us for years. I don't care who knows you if the state doesn't know who you are. Just introduce yourself to the state, make it clear who you are, get your papers, then we can put your signboard up again. Listen, we can work this out. I've been a civil servant for 40 years. Look at what you're doing now. For God's sake, get your permission and your papers so we can put it up again. -Don't you believe in God? -I do! They took it down Soner, what are you doing? You know my inspiration feeds on pain and suffering. We already have a tragedy now, so I just felt like singing a song. Get the fuck out of here, don't make me mad. Okay. -You don't let me feel the pain properly. -Okay. -Zerrin. -This is not a good time, Fazo. Zerrin, look. This is no time for an untimely fit. Later, please. Zerrin! Just look at it, my friend! Guys, I just heard amazing news. As Coach Fatih Terim said... Fazilet, you see? Obviously, she's the one who made the complaint! That's what I always tell you, you can be a slut, but not a big slut! I'll call the advisor. You know what? This is a blow below the belt. But just wait and see, I know what to do to her. I'll go to a hodja, have him cast a spell, and take her down. That lowlife! What do you mean you'll go to a hodja? What do you two mean, exactly? Welcome to 3,000 B.C. What are we supposed to do? Send her negative energy? Honey, visiting a hodja is so out of date. -Nowadays, everything can be done online. -Can you do it online? Of course, don't you have a device here that can go online? Something like a computer? Wait. Selma, bring my laptop. Give it to me. Put it. -It's on. -Come here. The online support is on. How can I help you? Hello, we would like to speak with Hodja Mehmet. I'm putting you through now. -Did you perform ablution? -Yes. -We'll talk to a hodja. -Cover your legs. -Peace be with you, too, hodja. -What's your problem? Tell me. Hodja, there is this lowlife and hypocrite called Menkibe Ozyollu. We need to place a bad luck curse on her, let's send something to haunt her or even ruin her life. So you need to buy a medium or premium package for a curse, that is not too weak or too strong, but it has to be a triple package. It costs 3,000 liras. Each package is 1,000 liras. -Do you approve? -We do, hodja. Alright then, I'll proceed with the purchase. -Do you approve? -We do. I ask again, do you approve? Do you want me to curse at you, hodja? What kind of approval system is this? But I need to ask you this three times so it can be approved in the system spiritually, too. Get a plastic bottle filled with water. Okay, Selma, bring a plastic bottle with water in it. -Here, we have it. -Put it on the touchpad. -We did, hodja. -Did you? -We did, hodja. -Did you? Yes, we did, hodja. He asks everything three times. Okay, now I'll start the operation. Hide somewhere safe. I can see you, don't do it. Now you can come out. In the name of God. -Are you out? -We are, hodja. Now, tell me who is victimized the most by the person you want to cast a spell on? I'm the one who is suffering the most, hodja. Okay then, you'll be the one to follow the procedures. -Okay, take the bottle now. -Okay. Now, listen carefully. This is how you'll cast the spell. Take a sip, gargle it in your throat, and put it back in your mouth. Then, you'll spit it onto whatever Ms. Cansu's body touches. But, this is very important. If you swallow even just a little bit of the water and it goes in your belly, then the spell will explode inside you. Don't swallow it or you'll burn in hell. Don't swallow it, be careful! If you swallow it, you'll perish. Am I to gargle it, hodja? What if we do it all together, like teamwork? Didn't you hear what I just said, my child? How could you talk to a hodja like that? Just turn it off. He turned it off. I couldn't get an answer. He's a hodja, you can't ask him everything you like. You heard the man. You have to gargle. Let's find out where that bitch is. I wonder when that slut will arrive. Did you get the water? I have it here, look. Don't worry. I mean, look at this place. Like we don't know who she really is. That upstart shit. She's here. -Welcome. -Thank you, little baby. How can I help? I have a reservation for a solarium session. Yes, you can go to room number three, Ms. Cansu. Okay, honey, I'd better change and go to room number three. -Of course. -Kisses. Fazilet, I'll go to the room before her, okay? If the reception lady gets suspicious, just talk about sewing or needlework, keep her busy. -Okay, don't worry. Just go. -May God help me. Hello, honey, the ladies' room is over there, right? Yes, it's there. Alright then, Ms. Menkibe. You get to be the victim this time. Goddamn you! I hope, when you eat, you can't take a shit, you greedy dog! But just once is not enough for you. Sweetie, I always get thirsty in the solarium. You better get me an energy drink. And put some sparkling water in it. I swallowed it! Damn me! Why did I do it? I swallowed it! Now you know my beauty secret, go get the drink. Okay, Ms. Cansu. -It's occupied. -I guess the session is not over yet. I'd better get you to the next door, number four. This is a scandal, but I won't cause a scene. Of course it's occupied, idiot. What's going on? I can't open it. Is it locked? Why can't I open it? I can't open it. I can't stay here, I have claustrophobia! I can't breathe! I can't breathe in here! Can anyone hear me? Is there a button? There is no button, is it a touch-screen? Goddamn it! Damn your fancy system! Wait a second. Try to think logically, Zerrin. Think logically, Zerrin! Think logically! I just can't, my logic is on fire! My logic is burning, too! It'll be pitch-black here! Oh, my god! My last sin is a terrible one. This is happening because of the spell. My god, please forgive me! Where is that hodja, now? I hope you can't breathe again! Sweetie, does it hurt too much? What do you think? Do you think it hurts too much, Fazilet? I think it does. What do you think? How do I look? I look like a chameleon. Look at me. My skin is the same color as the dress. I just need the dots on my face. If you put me as a dress in a shop, people would buy me. And where were you at that time? My phone is ringing. It's Mukerrem, I can't talk to her now, you get it. Hello, Muker. It's Fazo. Fazo, is this you? Mom is really bad this time. It's not like the other times. She keeps saying Zengo's name. You have to come, she's going to die for sure this time. -Okay, wait a second. -I'm waiting. Mukerrem says her mom is surely about to die now, and it's not like the other times, so she wants us to go there. This is what I call timing! You think now is a good time? It's time. She's on her deathbed and saying your name all the time. She has just a couple of hours left. We have to go. I made a wow. She was my milk-mother. I take refuge in God, from the evil of the expelled devil. In the name of God. -Get well soon. -Thank you, Mukerrem. Thank you. -There is no fog. -But she's breathing, I can hear that. Listen, she's still breathing. -Mom! -My child. Fazilet! -Milk-mother! -My child! -Mom! -I'm so sorry for your loss, my child. Mom! -Sorry for your loss, my child. Calm down. -Milk-mother. Calm down, ladies. -Hodja, may I ask you something? -You may, my child. I was the last person she saw, so will I get affected by this negatively? Did I sin? My child, the deceased has obviously gone to the afterlife, but it kind of looks like you pushed her there, with your face and all. But I didn't do anything, Mukerrem. Do you think it happened because of me? I came here seven times and she survived, but she died on the eighth. How could they blame me? Zengo, you're innocent, don't be silly. She would've gone even if she saw Mukerrem. May God bless her soul. -May God bless us with good fortune. -Milk-mother! I'm sorry for your loss! Mukerrem, I'm sorry for your loss. Let's go now, Fazilet. We're so sorry for our loss. Milk-mother. Dear, it looks terrible. But it'll help you for sure. What did you put on my face? Is this harmful? Isn't it too much? Don't be silly, your skin will absorb it. How could someone do this to their face? I left you girls for a second and you bring all kinds of trouble on yourselves. It's because of you. Since we met you, we haven't been able to get out of shit. You keep talking about Arzuhan, but we haven't even seen her yet. Are you schizoid? Is she your imaginary friend or something? You get bucket loads of money from us. But you don't do your job, advisor. I don't do my job? If I don't do my job, what will you say about these tickets? -What are those? -What are these? That's what we're asking, what are those? These are your tickets to Arzuhan! These are the tickets for the fundraising event of Arzuhan's association. It's impossible to find these! You can't buy these! You have these, thanks to Varhol Counselling and my reputation. But if you think I don't do my job, then you can't go. -I'm not giving you the tickets. -Mr. Advisor, we're so sorry, you know that Zerrin has been really stressed recently. Come on now, Fazilet! Always the same story. -I also have a heart. -Did I ever break your heart, chicklet? Why do you get me wrong? If there is an invitation, -then we're supposed to go. -Of course you are! But listen to me, we'll be acting very classy. This is a milestone for us, girls. From now on, we'll go straight up! Dear guests, welcome to this beautiful and meaningful event, organized by the Hand to Need Charity Association. As our guests are taking their seats, I'd like to invite Ms. Arzuhan Yabanci to give the opening speech as the chairwoman of our association. Do you see that greedy dog, Menkibe? She's obviously here to score points. Welcome all to this lovely event. Thanks to your donations, our association has, for 25 years... Zerrin listen to me, when the auction starts, you'll raise the sign when I tell you to, okay? The goal here is to draw the attention of Ms. Arzuhan and gain her favor. After that, we need to stop. Otherwise, we'll be left holding the bag, unable to carry it through. Please be careful, Zerrin. I know that, of course. You think I'm too ignorant. This is not my first time. I have spent years in auctions. All the money we'll raise tonight will be donated to the families in need. I shouldn't talk too long and... I'll hang you on the wall with my fist. Don't look at me. Let's see who'll have this magnificent piece of art. I wish you all a pleasant evening. That unique piece of art that Ms. Arzuhan spoke highly of in her speech is called The Five States of Fertility. And now the auction begins. -We're ready, right? -We are. The opening price is 10,000 liras. 15,000 liras, anyone? I get 15,000 liras. Now we're at 20. Anyone? That gentleman's bid is 25! Anyone for 30,000 liras? I see 35! We have new faces among us tonight, welcome, ma'am. Anyone to raise? We're at 35,000 liras. The bid is 40,000 liras now. The gentleman's bid is 50. From now, the price will rise by 10,000 liras. -We're at 60,000 now. -Baby, we're doing great. All the earnings from this magnificent piece that will benefit the orphans... While I was talking, we got 70,000 liras. It keeps rising, 80,000 liras. Anyone else? Zerrin, we have been doing so well. We got her attention, stop now. I'm the only one she's looking at. Now I see 100,000, of course the bidder is Ms. Cansu. -Zerrin, what are you doing? -120,000. -I know what I'm doing, leave me alone. -140,000, Ms. Cansu raises again. -We're at 160,000 now. -Zerrin, put that thing down. I'm about to leave it at a point where the price will burn her alive. The race is between two ladies now. Ms. Cansu bids 180,000. Anyone else? 200,000! That's what we've been hoping for, 200,000! Ms. Cansu, can we expect -220,000 from you? -No, I'm out. I'm good. -Ms. Cansu decides to withdraw. -How can she withdraw now? 220,000, anyone? Raise it! Why don't you raise it, you asshole? -Me? -Is your husband out of money? Snake! Congratulations, my dear. Enjoy it. To the lady with number 6. I'm not number 6! She's number 6, I'm 90! Anyone else? She's so generous and loves to make jokes, obviously. Blondie! I can give it to you for 180, are you in? -Going for 200,000. -Fat cat, are you in for 160? -Going once. -Don't. -Going twice. -Don't. -Last chance. -Don't do it. And sold! Shit! The Five States of Fertility... She bought it! She really bought it! Thank you, I'm used to such things. I feel proud. My name is Zerrin Civancinar. Zengo for short. I'm the founder of the Copper Village, Bakirkoy. I would like to congratulate the artist, that old guy. He looks like my late grandfather. Let me say it again, my name is Zerrin Civancinar, okay? This detail is so important. It's even more important than the statue. Art and me. Zerrin Civancinar paid 200,000 for it. Don't forget to write that I'm very close to Arzuhan Yabanci. Again. My name is Zerrin Civancinar. Okay? Don't misspell it. I'm on page 23 and my name is not mentioned at all, Fazo, not once. "An anonymous art-lover becomes the star of the event." An anonymous art-lover? You heard me repeating my name, right? I swear I did. Look at the cover. Menkibe didn't spend a cent but she's still on the cover. Is this today's tabloid journalism? -Good day. -Good day. We've brought a statue for this address. Yes, this is the place. Are you the owner of the statue? Yes. So you're that famous anonymous art-lover, then. Sir, I told them my name. My name is Zerrin Civancinar, okay? I bought the statue. Okay, Ms. Zerrin, can you sign here, please? -Have a nice day. -Won't you carry it inside? Ma'am, we're just shippers, not porters. We leave it and go away. -You want us women to carry it, then? -It's up to you, have a nice day. Why is everyone trying to play us? They call me an art-lover for spending 200,000 on a statue, but they see me as a porter when it comes to carrying it. They put the art right in the middle of the street. What are we supposed to do now, Zerrin? Zerrin! Do you need help? -No, Muzo, thank you. We can handle it. -Let me give you a hand. -No, just leave it. -I can carry it. Hello. Can you stop that, Muzaffer? -Hello. -Hello, Ms. Zerrin? Wait a second. Muzaffer, don't grab the ass. Hold both cheeks at the same time. Don't grab the boobs. Don't hold them. Hold both of the lobes. Is this Ms. Zerrin? Hello, ma'am. Just wait a second, for God's sake. Get behind now. Hold the waist, grab it tight, and push it hard. Okay? Try to push it from the bottom. Okay, Muzaffer? Leave it, turn around, grab it, and lift it up. Use all of your strength. Okay. Just leave it for God's sake! Your shop is unattended, just go. -Hello. -Hello? -Hello, Ms. Zerrin? -This is Zerrin Civancinar. Who is this? This is Arzuhan Yabanci. Oh, Ms. Arzuhan! How are you? My butlers just brought the statue to the mansion's garden. Yes, butlers! They're looking for a place to put it. I want to thank you so much for last night. We're having a meeting tomorrow with my friends from the association, for afternoon tea, we would love to enjoy your company, too. Could you join us? Let me check my agenda now, because this week, I'm extremely busy. -Okay. I think I'm available. -Alright then, see you tomorrow afternoon. Okay, thanks. Have a nice day. Girl, it was Arzuhan! She invited me to a tea party. I guess we'll talk about it there. I really hope so, Fazilet. Muzaffer, get the statue off the sidewalk, but be careful. Okay? Cover it with something, it shouldn't stay naked like that. This is a family-friendly neighborhood. Go ahead, come on. Welcome. Ms. Arzuhan is expecting you in the garden. -Please. -Thank you, my dear. -Follow me, please. -Thanks. -Hello. -Hello. -Welcome. -Thank you. Just like the Golden Girls. Dorothy, Blanche, where is Katherine? Ms. Arzuhan, I'll be inside. If you need anything just call out. Okay, dear. It was really hard to find this place, I'm used to visiting waterside mansions. This place seems like it's sitting on a hill to me. I couldn't see it when I was on the boat. But still, you have a nice place. And you have a sea view, too. Though the pool looks a bit small compared to the house. You have kids? -No. -Are you planning to have any? -No. -It seems a bit too late for that, anyway. The fresh air hits me hard! My jokes always get fresher in the fresh air. Ms. Zerrin, to be honest, me and my friends regret not knowing such a generous woman like yourself until last night. We're so grateful to have your generous donation, thank you. Thanks, believe me, I work so hard. When I don't go on holiday, I'm always busy with charity work. Believe me. For example, I spend every summer in Monaco. I admire Monaco. As you know, the sun hits at a straighter angle there. I'm obsessed with those beaches. And I like to sunbathe butt-naked there. I go topless. Fresh and sweet. Besides, nobody cares. If I did that here, with this body of mine, believe me, there would be chaos. How nice. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to introduce our members to you. -Aysel Berkman. -Nice to meet you. -Feride Vandenburgh. -Nice to meet you. -Nurhan Goldstein. -Nice to meet you. And Ms. Gonul Borekci. Well, your surnames make me feel as if we're in the United Nations Security Council. Yours sounds a bit too local, though. Well, you can't choose your family, right? Again, the fresh air! What's your name? -Zerrin Schweinshein. -Sorry? -Zerrin Schweinshein. -What? Civancinar. The original version is Schweinshein. Let me tell you its story. My grand grandfather went to the Siege of Vienna with the Ottoman army. When the siege was over, the Ottomans went home, but my grandfather stayed at the gates of Vienna. And he started to work as a doorman there and eventually passed away. I guess he paid his social security contribution there, so now we get his retirement wage. And we buy perfume in Dutti Frutti with that money. That's all that money can buy. How lovely. Ms. Zerrin is lovely, right? Ms. Zerrin, from now on, our association and I will always be there for you. Whatever you need, don't hesitate to ask for help. Don't mention it. But I'd like you to do me a little favor. Of course, what is it? If I'm not mistaken, you're the one organizing Istanbul Fashion Style Days. -That's right. -Great. Well, we have some designs, too. If you are available, we'd like to present our designs in that event. Of course, why not? Have you ever organized a professional fashion show? An important rule of the organization is to have a professional fashion show prior to our event. Of course, we have had lots of fashion shows. Then send me a recording by tomorrow. Of course, I'll send it with the office boy. I'll pick one of the best fashion shows we've had for you. Alright then, send me a file and I'll share it with the board members. Of course, I make the final decision, but they need to see it, too. Thank you very much, Ms. Arzuhan. We'd better take our leave now. We'll be visiting some waterside mansions as many friends of mine live in the area. It has been a great meeting, thanks. See you. Thanks. See you, Ms. Borekci. You look great in purple, thanks. Goodbye. I'll send the file with our office boy. I'll be waiting. -Have a nice day. -Thanks. Zerrin, how will we have the fashion show that you've been bragging about in there? Girl, where are you going tonight? -To a wedding. -So? So? I'm an aunt and I'm going to my nephew's wedding. You see, obviously, something will happen at that wedding. I have a working brain here, okay? I have an idea. -Leave it to me. Get in the car. -God, please help us. Zerrin! You said you had an idea, but you haven't told me anything yet. Don't worry, Fazo. I'm waiting for the right time. -The plan runs like clockwork. -I see. First, let's talk to the bride and groom. I wish you happiness! God bless, you look like a swan. Snow-white. Yes. May God bless my nephew! He looks so sharp, handsome, -and springy. -God bless. Well, why are we here now? As you know, you're a member of our family now. We're designers. And your girls are so pretty. This is such a great generation. Could they do a little catwalk, so we can record them? Would you be okay with that? Just five minutes. No! I won't. How could you not be okay with that? Fazo? My dear nephew, do something. Aunty, what can I say? She's our family's bride now, anyway. You guys can work something out. Is that so, Erdinc? Is this your final decision? I cleaned your shitty diapers for months! Alright then, Erdinc. Fazilet, just wait. We'll handle it between ourselves. I was going to put some jewelry on you, but I couldn't because it was too crowded. Now, take this and enjoy. Just five minutes, okay? It'll happen in the blink of an eye. This arm feels empty, you can put one here, too. That one too? Let's make your other arm happy as well. Here, take it. This is the second one. Enjoy it, okay? Add some more here, too, go on. Fazilet, I'll strangle her. Okay? Here. God bless her, she's so assertive. If you can find another bride like her, -we should have one, too. -My neck feels empty too. You've got to be kidding me, you damn... How did they find her, Fazo? Is this a kind of wedding gang? Better to be hung for a wolf than a sheep. Just give it, we'll take care of it. Put it on here. I feel like my body's been robbed. The dress is the only thing I have now. Give it to me. Here, enjoy it. My dear Erdinc, you've found yourself a great girl. But be careful, if you get divorced, she might steal your pants off your ass. I wish you happiness, Erdinc, okay? I wish you happiness. -Thank you, Aunt. -You're welcome, my sweet nephew. So are we okay now? Can we make the video now? Okay, but I have one more request. What else do you want? Penguin dance. What penguin? Come on! Come on! -Is this really what you sent her? -Yes. Guys, I worked my ass off to show you the importance of branding. How could you do that to me! What the hell is this? How could you send a video like this? You'd better not be hopeful. Who would let you in the show with this video, baby? What's wrong with it, chicklet? Why are you slandering it? -I think it's pretty as a flower. -Well, I'm sorry, Soner but he's right. It's so shitty. It has the effects of softcore porn from the '80s. You keep criticizing, but I used 1,200 special effects for that video. I pushed the button and waited for the rendering for five hours. What kind of effects are they? I can't even see my designs because of your effects. Were you trying to make a sci-fi movie? Anyway, we can't wait like this. I'd better call them. Let's find out what happened. It's better than suffering hellish torture. You have screwed up my career, too. My god, open the gates of your blessing for us. -My god, I am in the flow. -God, please help us. -Hello. -Sweet Berna. Hi, how are you? It's Semih, from Varhol Counselling. I'm good, Semih, how are you? What do you want to know? Berna, I'm in the middle of a meeting with the ladies now, we would like to know what they think of our video. Let me get you on the hands-free now, honey. Today, a short guy came here, he was wearing something strange. -He was a short-ass, anyway. -It's me, Soner. Anyway, he gave me a video. I got it and presented it to the board. Ms. Arzuhan asked what they thought of it. There was a weird look on everyone's face. It was chaotic. The room was full of negative energy, my god. I'd better not tell you more because the atmosphere was terrible. You're a pain in the ass! Well, Berna, honey, you're saying they don't approve? Ms. Arzuhan had the initiative, and she was like, "I guess this is kind of funny and different, and a colorful thing for our event." She was saying that it was a fun and influencing project. Cut to the chase! Why is she talking too much? -She just talks so much! -So they changed their minds and decided to spare you a very limited time at the end of the event... Hello? I'm not finished yet, but anyway. Bakirkoy Copper Village! -Advisor, Zerrin! -What is it, Fazo? How are we supposed to sew all those dresses? You know the shop is closed. They closed it down. Fazilet, the shop is sealed off. What do you mean? Only the door is sealed off, do you understand? Zerrin, I don't understand anything. You don't have to. You girls need to come to the shop tonight at 10 p.m. Okay? Where are you? -Come here, where have you been? -It took us a while. Someone might see us. Quiet. Come over. Thank god. Where have you been? Now, listen to me. They sealed off the door, but nobody said anything about the air conditioning hatch. We'll use it to get in, okay? I'm so smart! Come on, Meltem. Come on, Sister Emine. Just push yourself hard. I'm tired of your big ass! -Wait. -Get me in, PR guy. Turn the lights on. Okay, we don't have much time. We need to work fast, and don't waste any time, okay? Come on. Very nice. It goes like this. What the hell is that? Team Fatties! Come on! -Ironing is our trademark. -I heard something, quiet. -The officer! He's on patrol! -Be quiet! Ma'am, there was a call. Someone saw people trying to get in. -This place is sealed off. -Don't make noise, okay? Quiet! The state has sealed off this place. How could they get in? Did you see anyone? You've been as fit as a fiddle the whole week and now you decide to catch a cold? I almost caught his eye! Is there anyone who heard or saw something? I might have to take action on you, too. We'll see. He's gone. You can come out. What is he doing? Why can't he go somewhere else? Why are you staring like that? Should I take the stage in Fashion Style Days? I've got you models so we can pick the right ones. Alright, then. Bitter chocolate, since when have you been thin? At what weight do you see yourself in five years? Yes, we're all Turkish. Okay, alright. You're approved. You're okay. Come over, Merileen Moruun. She looks like Seda Sayan. After the show, I'll find a job for you on a daily TV show. Okay? Come over, zebra. Nice, she's as tall as Tulin Sahin. Okay, she looks nice. Come over, leopard. -Do you get sweaty in those pants? -Yes. So you can speak Turkish? -Just a little bit. -You're so sweet. You see, your friend can speak Turkish. So you'll have to study Turkish day and night until the show. -Okay? -Okay. Alright, then. You know what they say. Everything is fine. -Okay? You all need to memorize all that. -Okay. Alright, then. Bravo. Just look at yourself, then her. You see the difference? A woman should have some meat on her bones. 66. Chocolate. Very good. We're doing great. Oh, god. What are you looking at? Mind your own business! I didn't say anything, they said hi and I said hi back. This is nice, Fazo. Take it from here. Well, tonight, when I go home, I'll be alone. Completely alone. Even that greedy dog Menkibe has a husband. She does. You know, Fazo, fortune has evaded us. Can you believe I broke up with all four of my fiancés? It takes courage, Zerrin, okay? You're a brave woman. Well, at least I had some marriage gifts. You didn't even get to commit. I'm cursed anyway, Zerrin. Don't curse. I told you many times, it'll come back to you. -Don't curse. -Okay, I repent. I guess I only like assholes. Don't laugh. I have gold everywhere, but I sleep alone every night. There is a difference between being alone and feeling lonely. We're strong women. We don't need men to feel complete. There is no man around, anyway. I'm willing to be completed, but there is no guy to complete me. You're right. Forget about it. Just watch the stars. Who cares? Tomorrow, we'll shine just like them, too. Our brand will get what it deserves. -I hope so. -I'm a comet. And I'm Ursa Major. You're small, but your bearish star is big. My heart is big. This is Arzu, who has planned and organized everything for this Fashion Week in Istanbul. Monsieur Simon is a giant in the fashion world, a "fashion god" so to speak, so his comments and contributions on the event are very important. Fashion Style Days has been great for me so far. And my designs have been admired. The other designs are just rubbish, don't waste your time on them. Just one hour left, Fazo. Where are those models? I don't know, Zerrin. Will they have time to get dressed? Call the advisor. I called him five times but he won't pick up. Who knows where he's horsing around in his weird robe? Zerrin, hello. We're here as your neighbors to support you. And I didn't want to come here empty-handed, so I brought some gifts like sausage and pastrami. We've been waiting for someone else. Thanks, Muzo, I appreciate it. Put them there. -Sweetie, congratulations. -Thanks a lot. Welcome, ladies. I'm too agitated to talk to anyone now. Get over there. -So leave. -Should I leave? As you can see, we're all women here, you're the only guy here. Just leave. You're right, I wish you good luck, Zerrin, break a leg. All the best. Bless your heart, Muzo. Can you leave now? What the hell is he doing here? Get out! Why is he here? This place smells of pastrami because of him. Forget about the pastrami! Where were you? Where are the models? Is she asking me about the models? Is she? Honey, do you know where those models are now? Do you remember your trustworthy jelly-head guy, Soner? You'll see where Soner and the models are! Hello to everyone from Moscow, I'll continue my musical career in Moscow. As you can see, it looks like a rose garden here. Take care, everyone. Menkibe, thanks for giving me this opportunity. Thank you very much, goodbye to everyone from Moscow. -Zerrin! -She's gone! I'm fine. I just fainted a little bit, but I'm fine now. I'm fine. I said I'm fine, Fazilet! Get well soon! Good news travels fast, I got here as soon as I heard it. What is it, sweetheart? Your lousy pianist-singer's gone on vacation with those models? You're left by yourself? Poor you. My sweet hydraulic acid. Anyway, I came here to say I'm sorry. Carrion crow! Dung fly! You got the smell, right? I was expecting you, anyway. But don't worry, girl. Our show won't be over just because an idiot pianist-singer took away a couple of models. My team is not like your melted filler lips. I don't hire models with money. The Copper Village has my back. You might have forgotten about Bakirkoy, but we have bonds of affection here. Are you with me, girls? -We are! -Yes! Did you hear the sound of Bakirkoy? Now get your shit, sit down, and watch the real version of that style you stole from us. But don't blink, otherwise you'll miss some amazing moments. I sympathize with you, my dear high school friend. Get on the stage and don't forget to send kisses when you do the catwalk, I'll catch them, okay? Alright? Kisses, good luck. Let me kiss you in here first, then I'll continue on the stage. You jealous dog! Are you with me or not? -We're with you! -We're with you! -Who are we? -The Copper Village! Gather up! -The Copper Village! -The Copper Village! Here we go! Bakirkoy! Drabness makes us allergic By being fancy, we never feel lethargic Are you fancy or not? I can't look, my eyes bleed What shitty style you've got Chickens that wander inch by inch This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Have you ever been lynched? Kiss your style goodbye inch by inch This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Go every summer to the beach No meat, only chicken sandwich To carry you, we need a crane Behave, this is the Copper Village Chickens that wander inch by inch This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Good evening to everyone. I guess you didn't like our show. You all look disgusted by it. We didn't get any applause. But that's exactly what we aimed for. That's what we wanted as Fazy and Zengo. Because this is a rebellion. This is an outcry. Against your fabricated world and fictitious women, we just presented you the real women of society. Unsurprisingly, you didn't like it. It's out of your comfort zone. Because that is not a woman. This is a woman. A real woman. Fashion is not just for the upper crust, it's for the public too. But tonight, we just saw your perception of the public. We're simple community dwellers. We're chubby women. And we're happy to be chubby. That's all from us. Thank you. It didn't work, Fazo. You are magnificent, fantastic, sophisticated. Best fashion show ever! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Thanks! What are you doing? Chickens that wander inch by inch This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Have you ever been lynched? Kiss your style goodbye inch by inch This is the Copper Village This is the Copper Village Thank you. Cheers. Hi! This is my favorite style, yes, I like jazz. Very good. Go on, guys. Nice. Have fun. Sweet Ms. Arzuhan, how is it going? It's going well, Ms. Zerrin, thank you. Thanks a lot, of course. That's very kind of you. Thanks. Have fun. I'm Zengo. Born in Bakirkoy, daughter of a blue-collar family. My parents used to sell panties in the outdoor market. I didn't lose heart, I worked hard. When I was 15, I was faced with Menkibe's cruelty and experienced all the pain and suffering of the world, and became old in a single day. I designed tons of dresses. I fought that douche bag Menkibe. And I won. Now, I'm where my destiny changed. In this luxurious villa. The house that I wanted to destroy is mine now. My home. How could I know that my heart which stopped beating for vengeance would start to beat again for design? I'm Zengo. Bakirkoy's source of pride.
