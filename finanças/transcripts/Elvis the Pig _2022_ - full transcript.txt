Meet Elvis, the pig my dad bought me when I was a little girl. The cutest, chubbiest thing you've ever seen. Elvis is my partner in crime. We do just about everything together. My dad loved Elvis at first, but recently, he's been really stressed out or something, but I'm sure once I teach Elvis a couple more tricks, he's sure to impress Dad. A lot of people think of pigs as food, but they're so much more. They have feelings, and emotions, and they're super smart. Did you know pigs are the seventh smartest animal in the world? Smarter than my dad, but don't tell him that. Bye, Mom, bye, Dad! Love you! Bye sweetie, have a nice day. Dad! Oh, yeah. Have a good day, sweetie. Is Dad okay? Yes, why do you ask me that? Well, he's always holding his head in frustration. Make sure he takes his vitamins. It's crucial at his age, you know? ♪♪♪ Let's go, germ. - Remember, keep a distance. - Mm-hmm. Okay, you two, I want you to learn as much as both brains will take in, all right? All right. Okay, Mom. Bye, Dad. Bye! ♪ Okay, you go ahead. But Mom says you have to ride with me! Yeah, I'll watch from back here. Okay. Bye, Elvis! I'd say goodbye, but what's the use? Nobody seems to hear me when I talk. Ooh, what a lovely day! Unbelievable! I've got a 10,000 word vocabulary, and all anybody hears when I speak is "Oink, oink, squealy grunt." ♪♪♪ His shirt was tucked in so tight! Hey, pig girl! Do you want to hang out - with me and Chloe? - And me! - No, thanks. - Okay. Why don't you play with us? Mm, I don't know. I just don't feel like it. All right. Wait up! ♪♪♪ Where's your sister? Probably at home looking for Elvis, as per usual. I hate pigs. Hi, Dad! Bye, Dad! Hi, bye. - Hey! - Hey. How're you holding up? I'm gonna miss this place. Yeah. Me too. When are you gonna tell the kids? Tonight. At dinner. Okay. You know, it's gonna be different. But change can be good. It feels like we don't have a choice. I haven't been making what we used to the last couple of years and... I know. Don't worry about it, kids will understand. - I'm gonna go make some dinner. - Okay. Love you. - Thanks, honey. - You're welcome. So, how was your day, Riley? Good, Teddy fell off his chair in class. Teddy? He's the new boy at school. Oh, the new boy. Is he okay? Yeah, he's really crazy. How was your day, Nylee? Do you really want to know? Okay, well, I have some news. Oh, let me guess. Nylee. What's your news, Dad? Well, you know how money hasn't been the same here for a while and we're a little behind. Well, a lot behind. No, I didn't notice. Please, listen to your dad. I thought you loved mac and cheese. Yeah, I did when I was eight. I love mac and cheese. So does Elvis! What's not to love! Where's mine? Okay... well, the bottom line is that we can't really afford this place anymore, so how would you girls feel about moving to the city? Cool, let's go. Really? Okay. - How about you, Riley? - Okay. Whatever you need us to do, Daddy. Okay. Wow, I totally thought this was gonna be a harder discussion. See? I told you. Elvis would like to move, too. Not so fast there, Riley. See, he's excited. I think there's another shoe about to drop. So, when do we move? Soon, and let's talk about Elvis. What about Elvis? He can live anywhere. This is gonna be good. Nylee. Okay, here it goes. Well, pigs don't live in the city, honey, they live on farms. So, what are you saying? He's saying Elvis has to go. Is that true? I'm sorry, Riley, but Elvis can't come with us to the city. He's a pig, Riley, you'll get over him. He's not just a pig. He's my best friend. Nylee, you need to be more considerate of your sister. I'll go talk to her. What? It started off so well. Where did I go wrong? Probably when you said Elvis had to go. You know, how about when I went from being a part of this family to, "Oh, hit the road, porky!" Riley? You okay? No. Elvis was my best friend. We can't just leave him. But nobody said that you're never gonna see him again. We just need to find him a new place to live. Just like the horses and all the other animals. Look, I know you're upset, but we've got to be strong. For your daddy, okay? Okay, Mommy. Thanks for making me feel better. - I love you. - I love you, too. Let's go talk to your dad together, okay? Okay. Here they come. Can I be excused? Yeah, go ahead. Riley, I'm really sorry about Elvis. It's okay, I understand. And besides, Mom said I could visit him every day. Every day? Mom said that? I did not say every day. - How about once a week? - Only once? Look, I think we can do three times a week, just to start off with and see how it goes, okay? Okay. Okay. Three times a week. So, where is he moving to? Well, I've got a friend who's got a farm not too far away from where we live. How does that sound? Okay. Elvis, how does that sound? You know, it sounds like asking Humpty Dumpty how he was feeling before he fell off the wall. Hello, ladies! How are ya? Now... I... I just wonder if maybe you could take this, and maybe you could take it to your family? You know, I hope you can come out, it's really good food. Here you are, take it, there you are! That's nice! All right, you have a really good day now. ♪♪♪ Hal Dalbrooke, it's a pleasure to meet you! And this is my partner, Dwayne! Yeah, it is real nice to meet you, ma'am. And it's nice to meet you. And it's nice to meet you. Now this here, this must be Elvin. Yeah. Oh, he's real nice, ain't he, Dwayne? I might believe him if he wasn't looking at me like a Big Mac! So, Elvis is moving to a market? No, Elvis is gonna be living with Hal on his farm, not too far from our house. How about we give Elvis a vote? Well, it's not really home anymore. No, I guess not. Well, when are you movin'? It could be anytime. We just have to sell the farm. We're off to the big city! We're excited, right girls? ♪♪♪ Honey, why don't you take the kids to the market, I gotta talk to Hal here. Yeah, okay. Let's go. Come on, Elvis. ♪♪♪ Sorry about that. My daughter's really attached to Elvis. Really? How attached? Oh, like, her best friend in the whole world. You gotta do whatever's right for your family. Can I ask you, is there anything that spooks him? Horns. Loud horns really freak him out, but other than that, he's great. Well, you know, we can come and get him whenever your daughter's ready, you know? Thanks, we really appreciate that. And, you know, your daughter can come and visit him anytime she wants. That's gonna mean a lot to her, thank you. All right. Excuse me. Why Elvis? Oh, I was... Am a fan, it's... Well, thank you, thank you very much. That's just an impression I do. That was good. We'll give you a call when we're ready. All right, well, you have a good day now. Hal, the cookout's in a few days. Yeah, well, he's perfect! Yeah, we'll go, and get Edwin. Or should we call him Bacon? Now, you go get that horn, you know what to do. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. ♪♪♪ Hey, guys! I think it's all gonna work out. Oh, that's good! They seemed really nice. What do you think, Riley? I don't know, Mom. Elvis didn't seem to like 'em. You've gotta be kidding me! I'm betting their faces are on wanted posters in six states. I wouldn't trust them with my food bowl if it was attached to my leg by superglue! Yeah, I don't know either, Dad. ♪♪♪ Here it goes! Elvis, wait, no! - Riley! - Elvis! Too scary, too scary, too scary. Get me away, get me away! ♪♪♪ Move, move, move! Out of my way, everybody! Please, Elvis coming through! ♪♪♪ I can't slow down! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mm! Delicious! I hate pigs! ♪♪♪ So, that was fun. It could've been worse. How could it have been worse? I don't know. It just could've. Remember when Elvis used to chew on the walls? That was way worse than knocking over some cakes. Elvis was a baby when he did that, Riley. He's an adult pig, he shouldn't behave that way. We have to pay for those cakes. He doesn't like horns. Who has an air horn at a market? I'm sorry, Riley, but it's time for Elvis to go. - But, Dad... - No "buts," and that's final. He goes tomorrow, so say your goodbyes, and tonight he sleeps in the barn. But you said he could stay until we moved! That was before he wrecked the market. Maybe it's time to get some real friends. I have real friends, Nylee, so be quiet! Yeah, Nylee, that's not nice. It's not fair, just leave me alone. Well, Dwayne, that was way too easy! Now, all we have to do is sit around, and wait for the calls. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! Now, you don't want to fall into there! You know what that is, don't ya? Poop? Okay, Dwayne, gimme another ball. We're out of balls. All right, well, well. We'll just use one of these. Fore! So, is there anything you're excited about with the city? Nothing. Come on. I know this is hard for you. But I promise it's gonna get better. It always does. Elvis is my best friend. I know. And you're his. But... you're mine, too. Hmm? Don't you ever, ever forget that. - You're pulling. - Oh, sorry. - I love you, sweetheart. - I love you, too. And your dad, well, he loves you so, so much. - You know that, right? - Mm-hmm. Thanks for making me feel better, Mom. That's kind of my job. - I love you. - I love you, too. Now go to bed. - Night-night. - Good night. What? Nothing. I'm just pretty much the best mom in the whole world. Does she still hate me? She doesn't hate you. Thinks you hate Elvis. You used to love Elvis. What happened? I don't hate Elvis, he's just getting older and harder to deal with. I'm getting older, and harder to deal with, are you gonna get rid of me? It's not the same, and you know it. I do know it. She just needs a little bit of time, okay? I'm gonna go to bed. Good night. ♪♪♪ Elvis! I don't remember leaving a wake-up call. Elvis. Wake up, it's time to go. Okay, I'm up, I'm up. Time to get up, sleepyhead. Come on. - Riley's gone! - What? Yeah, she's not in her room, she's gone! - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure! Elvis is gone too. - Relax, just calm down. - My baby is gone. We go find them now! - Now! - Let's go, get in the truck. I'm sorry you have to leave, Elvis. I'll try my best to see you as much as I can. I'll miss our talks, our hugs, seeing your chubby cheeks every day. But no matter what, you'll always be my best friend, Elvis. I pinky swear. And I got a special treat. One of Dad's donuts. Wow, great. He already wants to ship me off with Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee. He's going to be thrilled to hear I'm eating his donuts. Wow, that's really good. Wow. Mm. Mm, mm, mm. ♪♪♪ This is really good. It's sweet. Wow. Mm. Oh, my lord, that is really good. That hits the spot. That's really good. How about one for the road? - Oh, not again! - Elvis, wait! Help, get me outta here! Where would they have gone? - This is all my fault. - No, no. This is nobody's fault. We just need to focus on finding them. Elvis? What's the matter with me? It was just a horn. I'm smarter than that, I... I... Why did I run away? Elvis? Elvis! It's okay. Riley will find me. She... she's my best friend. She'll find me. Holy, talk about creepy places! It even smells creepy. This is where I'd expect to find characters like Hal and Dwayne. Elvis! Elvis, where are you? I knew it! That was Riley! I knew she'd find me. ♪♪♪ Hey, nice backpack! Hang on, Riley! I'm coming! These short legs can only run so fast. Hey, gimme that! No, no! Give it back! No! No! Tug o' war! I just want the bag! - I'm gonna win. - Help, someone! Elvis! I love playing tug o' war! Get away from her, Rusty! Try picking on someone your own size! Or species! Or with more than two legs, and a mean and dangerous disposition! - Like me! - See ya, porky! Elvis, you saved my life! Heck, I'm no Obi-Wan Kenobi, but, on the other hand, you can call me... Super Pig! Just wait till Dad hears about this! Let's go! What's going on? Have you seen Riley? Riley's gone? I didn't notice. Not now, Nylee! I'm calling the police. Okay. Wait, Mom, she's right there. So much to learn, Riley. Well, now that that's settled, I'm gonna go to a friend's house, and try to save a friendship! Riley! Where were you? We were looking all over for you! You didn't check the meadow. Why were you in the meadow, hmm? You know it's dangerous. Well, actually, that was my fault. Well, Elvis got scared by a boat horn so he ran into the meadow. I'm tired of Elvis being a problem. - But he saved... - I don't want to hear - another word about Elvis! - ...my life. He's gone tonight. What? That's not fair! Mom? I'm sorry, Riley. We were just so worried. That's not fair, you never want me to be happy! Hal? How's this gonna go down? What, are you stupid? Maybe. Okay, listen up. That little incident with the horn at the market, now that was pure genius. Thank you, thank you. Not you. Me. - Sorry. - Okay, now, Dwayne, stay with me here. All right, now, they're gonna want to try, and get rid of Elvin at some point. Now, that's gonna be perfect timing for us. Elvis. The pig's name is Elvis. He's actually really cute. The dad called for us to pick him up. - What? - Sorry, I was... Okay, just shut up. Now, why didn't you tell me this? Because I was on the phone taking phone calls for the roast, and I... When can we pick him up? As soon as possible. Tonight! It worked! I am good! How many people have subscribed, and paid for it? 17 have subscribed and most of 'em are paid up. It's gonna be the best scam yet! Maybe, maybe! Now, Dwayne, do you have any questions? Y... yeah. Okay, Dwayne. About what we're talking about? Yeah. How are you gonna be the judge and also cook a pig? Hey, Dwayne, you're gonna enter the contest and you're gonna win the contest. And then the money is gonna go to me! It is pure genius! But what am I gonna get out of it? Well, Dwayne, you get to cook yourself a fine, mouth-watering meal. But I can't cook. You frustrate me sometimes, my friend. Come on, let's go do some good, all right? Hi! You must be Mr. Bell? That's right. And you are? Your realtor. Alyssa. - Alyssa White. - Oh, right, hi. Did I forget a signature or... Oh, no. No. I've actually come here to tell you some great news. Um, did I come at a wrong time? No, sorry. Some of us are having trouble leaving. Uh, what's the good news? Well, we have an offer on the farm. Oh... And the best news? $50,000 over asking price! Oh, that was fast. A lot faster than we were expecting. I know! Aren't I great? Yeah. Great. Okay, well, I'll bring all the paperwork for you to sign tomorrow, all right? Don't you just love it when things work out? Yeah, uh, thank you, I guess. My pleasure. Well, see you tomorrow! Have an excellent afternoon, Mr. Bell! Ciao! - Want some juice? - Sure, thanks. So, are you actually excited to move to the city? Uh, kind of, I guess, I mean it's not really gonna happen for a while, so... But you should come by the farm this week. I know my dad felt really bad about what happened at the market. Yeah, that sucked. That Elvis is nothing but trouble. Well, I mean he's not that bad. He's actually pretty cool. You should come to the pig roast my dad entered. Why would I do that? Here. Wait. I know him. My dad was talking to him at the market about sending Elvis to his farm. Oh, this is awkward. When is this? A couple of days. Relax, Nylee. No, Elvis isn't just a pig. He's my sister's best friend. Listen to how that sounds. I have to go. We have to finish this. Just talk to your dad in the morning. You said it probably won't happen for a while. Okay, fine. Hey, kiddo. It's time. He's all loaded up. Please take care of him, he's family. Yeah, well, don't you worry. Elmo's in good hands. His name's Elvis. My apologies. Elvis. Please take good care of him. Ma'am, like I was tellin' your husband here, not to worry. Once he gets settled in with the other pigs... Oh, did you hear that, Riley? He's got other pigs to play with! She really loves that pig, huh? Yes, she does. Okay, Riley. It's time to say goodbye to Elvis. Hey! It's not goodbye, it's just see you later. I love you, Elvis. I'll visit you as soon as I can. I'm sorry I have to leave. I don't get it. The kid and the pig are best friends. Shut up, Dwayne. I'll miss you more than anything. See you later, Riley. You'll need glue to fix that one. Yeah. Kids. Yeah, I... I don't get that one either. Shut up, Dwayne. All right, well, we best be on our way and we'll let you know when you can come and visit him. Please, make sure that's pretty soon. You can see he's her everything. You have my word, ma'am. Thank you. Okay, Elvis. See you later. Goodbye, Mr. Bell. Thank you for everything. All right, we'll be on our way. Come on, Edwin. Hey. This does not feel good, does it? I promise you... with a little bit of time, maybe a lot of time... it will get better, I promise. It's not just Elvis. This is our home. We have memories here. Memories we'll never forget. What if Elvis doesn't like it? What if he's scared? You know, in the meadow, Elvis saved my life. A big, scary dog came after us and he scared him away. He's my hero. Elvis saving you makes him my hero, too. Everybody's gonna miss this place. I'm gonna miss it and your dad is too. If nobody wants to go then why are we leaving? You'll understand when you're all grown up. Adults make things so difficult. Yup. When I was your age... I had a bird called Ace. Ace. I like that name. Well, Ace was my best friend in the whole wide world. Did you have to leave him? No, but grandpa left the window open and Ace flew right out. Did you ever find him? Nope. That was the last time I ever saw Ace. Your grandpa felt so bad and I was absolutely heartbroken. Just like you are right now. So you know how I feel? I do. And I also know that Elvis isn't gonna live very far away from us. We can go and visit him any time. Who knows where in the world Ace is. Probably dead now. Probably. It was a very, very, very, very long time ago. What do you say you and me go play a game to take our mind off of this? Uno? Uno it is. Miss a turn! Well, go! All right, four. One, two, three, four. - It's six. - That's not six! Hey, mom, do you know where dad is? Hey, Nylee. Um, I think he's in the shed. Okay, thanks. Uh, how's homework coming? Yeah, it's great. I'll show you later. You go. Changed to yellow! Your turn! What? Hey, dad. Can I talk to you? - Hey, Ny, what's up? - It's about Elvis. I don't want to talk about Elvis right now. He just went to his new home and your sister's really upset and... What? He's gone? But you said not until the farm was sold? The farm is sold. What? - Already? Really? - Yeah. Look, I know it was fast, but... we just gotta move on. No, Dad, we have to get Elvis back. - Come on, Elvis is gone. - But... No "buts," Nylee, and I need you to drop it. - But dad... - Enough, Nylee! I don't want to talk about it! Change to blue! Uno! Hey, wanna play? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You girls play, I've gotta go feed the horses anyway. I'll be right back. Riley, I gotta talk to you. Why? What did you do this time? Nothing! It's about Elvis. What's wrong with Elvis? Mom, I can feed the horses. Oh, okay. Thank you. Uh, I'll help, too. Okay. Thank you, girls! So, what happened to Elvis? Well, nothing happened. Yet. This is the guy who took Elvis. I know. We have to do something! Have you told dad? I tried! Okay, Elvis needs us more. What about mom? You know she's with dad. We have to save Elvis. You and me. How are we gonna find him? It isn't too far from here. We can leave early in the morning, okay? But if I leave again, mom and dad will ground me forever. Elvis needs us more than ever, Riley. Why do you care about Elvis all of a sudden? Because Elvis is family. So, are you in? I'm in!

You can't just take him away from his food. Yeah, listen to her, Nylee. It's not nice to come between Elvis and dinner. We can't stay here, they're gonna come back! Well, well, well. Look what the pig just dragged in. Hey, a little respect, that's my family you're talking about. Mm! That is amazing. We're taking Elvis home. Oh, now, I don't think so. Now, a deal is a deal. Yeah, but that was before we knew about the pig roast! The what? Uh, okay, now... Do you have any evidence of this pig roast? Yeah, we do! Show him the poster, Nylee. I don't have the poster. Oh, well, well, you don't have any evidence? He's coming home with us now! All right, now, little ladies, I think you're gonna have to listen to your daddy here. Now, we made a deal, all right?

I didn't think about you guys, or Elvis, or any of the other animals. I'm really sorry for putting you through all of this. I'm really sorry to interrupt this heartfelt family moment. However, if we want the farm to sell, we have to sign that paperwork by tonight. If I gotta work a little harder, then that's what I gotta do. So, we can stay? Can we? Yeah, we can stay.
