HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW HER? SHE'S A REPORTER FOR A SMALL-TIME COLLEGE NEWSPAPER. THEY ACTUALLY PRINT HER PARANOID RAVINGS OCCASIONALLY. SHE'S BEEN RIGHT OFTEN ENOUGH FOR ME TO KEEP TABS ON HER. UNFORTUNATELY, SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE AROUND MUCH LONGER TO WRITE ANOTHER ONE. LOOK, GRAY, WE CAN'T DO THIS. KILL HER. SHE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. YOU CAN'T SILENCE EVERYONE. YOU KNOW THE RULES, MURPHY-- NO WITNESSES. ONE DAY, THE TRUTH WILL BE KNOWN. SHUT UP. DON'T DO IT, GRAY. PUT DOWN YOUR GUN. I MEAN IT. YOU CAN'T KILL ME. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I HAVEN'T TAUGHT YOU HOW.

JUST IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES. YEAH. I SAW WHAT THAT PIECE OF SHIT COULD DO. THINK OF DROPPING A CASE OF THESE SPIDERS BEHIND ENEMY LINES-- EACH ONE LAYING AN EGG IN ITS ENEMY HOST, EACH GENERATION GROWING LARGER THAN THE NEXT. THE GROUND WOULD SHAKE UNDERNEATH THEIR MIGHTY FOOTSTEPS AS THEY LAY WASTE TO EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH. Marci: YOU'RE FUCKING INSANE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE DONE? WE HAD WORLD DOMINATION WITHIN OUR GRASP. OH, WE COULD'VE LED AN ARMY UNLIKE ANY OTHER-- AN ARMY OF LIVING, BREATHING KILLING MACHINES. WE KILLED THAT THING. YES...

THE SUN'S GOING TO SET, AND SPIDERS HUNT AT NIGHT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. GET IN. WE'LL FIND HER WHEN WE'RE AIRBORNE. ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO FLY THIS THING? I CAN FLY THE BOX IT CAME IN. WHAT'S THE PLAN, MURPHY? WE'RE GOING TO SET THE CHOPPER DOWN IN FRONT OF THE SPIDER, THEN TAKE THE SHOT AND BLOW THAT SUCKER TO KINGDOM COME. I WON'T MISS THIS TIME. I NEVER MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] GET UP! GET UP! YOU BASTARD! [SIRENS] I STILL CAN'T SEE IT. IT'S TOO DARK. WE'LL FIND IT. Radio dispatch: 211 IN PROGRESS, SOUTH OF PICO.
