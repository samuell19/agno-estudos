I mean how am I supposed to work like this? Look at these working conditions. He always talking bout he want a "masterpiece, "a masterpiece!" He better let me master these pieces!

You may have grew up with the white people. But that ain't scoliosis on your back, you're black. And another thing, if you think you're gonna make it in this business, you better take a look around. I ain't never seen a supermodel like you before in my life. Fat! Who do you think you are? What's going on here? Did you hear what he just said to me? You better straighten your girl out before I straighten her out. I am not gonna let him talk to me that way. Obh-tuh! And did you see this dress? I am not wearing this. Do you know who my parents are? I want him fired! Calm down, I know you're upset. Why don't you just cool off and go home. No, send him home. Everybody's going home. Once Armad is finished with the girls then we're done. We can not do anything more until the shipment of clothes arrives tomorrow. So go home. You know it's not polite to stare. Huh? It's not polite to stare. You're staring at me. You know, a greater tragedy would be for me to ignore the fact that I noticed you. Wouldn't you agree? Clever and attractive. But just a little too cocky. Well, cocky wasn't what I was going for exactly. More like interested. It's not every day you see a woman in your position that doesn't compromise. I'm Mikey. Alicia. And trust me, that wasn't a matter of compromise. If would of put on that dress I might as well go and work for Playboy. Hey Mike, it's time to go man. I see you met my friend Alicia. Yeah. We were just talking about how we both hate hypocrites. Right Alicia? I'm hungry. Oooh, let's go to Cafe Du Monde. Let's go eat some grown up food, then go to Cafe Du Monde. Whatever. Wanna come?

Something about you. You're not like other girls. You're different. What do you mean? Look, you know, I've dated a lot. I was tired of the girl with just the pretty face. When I walked into the studio the day of your photo shoot, I expected more of the same. Just a bunch of women, beautiful but nothing on the inside. Then I met you. And you're not like that, at all. Don't get me wrong. You are the most beautiful woman I've ever met. But you're so much more than that. You're someone I look forward to being with. I spent all my life looking for Mrs. Right Now.

Wow, this place is beautiful! Angela always did wanna get married on the beach. It really is a blessing. It's amazing. I never knew someone could get married in a place like this. Well you never know. Maybe you'll be the next one to get married in a place like this. I don't think this is in my daddy's budget. You never know what can happen. Well maybe if Mikey decides to pay for my wedding too. Hey Isabel come here for a second. He mighta paid for it, I just wanna know how. Did you say something Mr. Hamilton? No I'm just ready to get out of this suit. Y'all ready to get something to eat or what. Hey, y'all ready for the reception? Look at this dude. Let's go to the beach! All right, get your bathing suit. Wow, I've never seen a more beautiful view. The ocean ain't that bad either. What you thinkin' bout? I was just thinking how beautiful it is out here. Yeah. I can't think of anyone else I'd rather be here with than you. Why can't you just stay with me? I've got business to take care of. You know that. But it's vacation. Yeah but somebody's gotta pay for it. You shouldn't have to work on vacation. Come on. Believe me, I wanna be here with you. That's why I'm taking you shopping. Look, when I get back it'll just be you and me. Deal? Okay. Aight, that's better. Hey Mike, y'all ready to go? Yeah gimme one second. All right. You ready? Yeah. All right. All right, we'll see y'all later. See ya later? I thought you guys were coming with us. Nah, we're gonna hang back. Yeah, we'll just catch you guys later. Mikey; Okay but just so you know, I've got some business to take care of while we're here. Well are you going to be able to make it to David's dinner? That's kind of the reason why I wanted to take everybody out today. All right. Well hopefully we'll see you guys later. What business could he possibly have in Cancun? Man can't believe we gotta stay in separate rooms though. That's not even a fight worth having. Man I don't care what Momma and Daddy say, I wanna be in the same room with my girl, hell. Yeah man, we should be able to stay in the same room. What?! What the hell. You out your mind? That's my sister. Hey guys. Jeremy look what I got. Dang Ginger. How much stuff did you get? Shut up Kevin. It's not like you paid for it. Neither did you. Mikey said buy some stuff not the whole store. Come on Jeremy. Kev it's cool man. It's not a problem. All right. Come on Isabel, let's go. You know, he takes really good care of you guys huh? Yeah, he's always been like that. I'm more concerned about what it is that you got. It's a secret. I can keep secrets. Come on. Michael felt like he had to take care of us. It was hard. I mean you remember. Half the time I didn't know where our next meal was coming from. And then one day I came home to a house full of groceries. All right, so we was at church right? Right. She had a hat. On that head? Shut up. Mikey: You know how big her hats be. Ya hear me, the hat had to cover her whole head so it was blocking the view Who hers? Yeah her hat, she had a hat on. What?! That piece was so big Wait she said she got a whole wig She was blocking the usher board the whole usher board. The whole usher board at church? The whole usher board. How I never knew nothin' bout this? How'd it, how did it get that big? Shut up Kevin. I think, you know what else? Her hair. Isabel I know you not talkin'. That purse don't match nothin' you have on. Ginger was so young, I didn't think I had the right to ask where everything was coming from. I didn't know what to do. All of it? Oh cause you paid for it, right? Well it costs more. Hey guys, guys I've gotta take off early my business meeting was moved up. But... Hey let's go jet skiing. No, I cannot get my hair wet. Oh come on Ginger, it'll be fun. Mikey's always been running. Searching for somethin'. I just hope he finds what he really needs. Didn't expect to see y'all out of the room. Yeah, just wanted to see the sunset. Aww, that's so romantic. Hey where's Mikey? I don't know where Mikey is. See you guys later. You're late. You changed the time. Doesn't matter, you're still late. You should've been more prepared. You know how he can get. But you can relax now, we have a long way to go. Hey what exactly does Mikey do? Cause I don't understand why someone would come all the way out here to do business. I mean, what do clubs in New Orleans have anything to do with clubs in Cancun? I don't know. I think he might have like some business partners down here or something. I guess maybe he's trying to bring a little bit of that, uh, Cancun flavor to New Orleans. But, I just stay outta all that stuff. Let him do his thing. What's wrong with Alicia? I'll go talk to her. Oh, so that's how you wanna play. Wait, you no I can't get my hair wet. A penny for your thoughts. You know I haven't heard anybody our age say something like that. Me and my mom were pretty close. She used to say it when she was alive. I'm so sorry. I didn't know your mother passed away. I'm okay now. It happened a few years ago. So what were you thinking about? You're really lucky to get married in a place like this. So that's what you were thinking about. What? You and Mikey. How's it going between you two? I didn't mean it like that. We're not ready to get married yet. Well why not? We're just not ready for that. Well I'm not ready for that. And why is that? Because, I don't know. I mean, how did you know you were ready? I had a peace about it. I just knew he was the one. I just don't get that. What do you mean a peace? Well I knew what I wanted. I knew who I was. I wasn't looking for David to complete me. I didn't need him to make me whole. But isn't marriage 50/50? Don't the two become one? You become whole when you get married, right? Well, that's what I thought too. Most people think a relationship is 50/50, but how can anyone expect to have a relationship with half a person? You can't. You have to have 100 percent from both sides if you want the marriage to work and be good. And to get 100 percent from yourself you have to be complete and whole. Me and David have that. We both know who we are. More importantly, I know who I am. And I had to learn that from my relationship. And I'm not talking about with some guy. Alicia, I didn't learn who I was until I met Jesus. You see this? This is one of our restaurants. Nice, quaint. Look, a lot is riding on this meeting. You might want to take it more seriously. I am serious. Have a seat Mikey. Have you been here before? The food is great. You were late, so I ate without you. But get something to eat, we'll pick up tomorrow. I'm sure Sasha will take care of you. Get him a room close by. We don't want to be late again. You know it isn't proper to invite yourself into someone else's room. Fabian told me to make sure that your night was comfortable. Thank you. No thanks.

Hola Sasha. You've been gone a very long time. Yes, well I've been away taking care of some business. Fabian's missed you. I see you've brought un papi chulo with you this time. I'm more concerned with his other qualities. Maria? Que? Is he busy? Let me go see. Make sure you change. You know how particular he can be. What type of business could he be doing where he'd have to disappear from a party that he paid for? Just doesn't make any sense. You always did have good taste in wine. And you always had a healthy appreciation for good quality. So... what's so special about this kid? Senor Tamassio, su invitado lo espera. Show them in. Well he's here now. So why don't you be the judge. Fair enough. What are you doing? Now as pretty as you are, where would your face be if I deprived you of those pretty little eyes? It's missing something. Now isn't that better? Why don't you go get Mikey something to drink. Have a seat Mikey. I heard you been enjoying yourself. You like this life, don't you? I can't say that I completely disagree with it. Why don't you and Francesca go freshen up. Those are the properties that you'll be acquiring over the next few months. I really need someone to take over the operation in New Orleans. And I'd like the change to happen quickly. But if we move too fast people will start to take notice. That's why Diluca's here. The transition is going to happen over three phases. First, we're going to make you manager over the properties. This shouldn't raise too many questions, since you already are the manager of your own club. The properties I own are night clubs. But these aren't clubs. If you pay close attention you will notice that each property is a prime location. Making money in this business is the easy part. The question many people fail to answer is, how do you keep it without getting caught. And that's where you come in. You see Mikey most things we do in the drug business are less than reputable. The more legitimate you look the easier it is. I've been watching you Mikey. You have a real knack for business. So if you want you can call this a trial run. Before our dinner arrives my wife and I would like to thank all of you for coming out to celebrate this day with us. And to my uncle and pastor for marrying us, and to my cousin Mikey who's actually the one responsible for us being here today. Though he couldn't make it out tonight. Don't worry about that cuz. To the bride and groom. I'll expect a lot out of you Mikey. But I'd be a fool if I didn't have a little security. There's an old expression, never put all your eggs in one basket. Aww, there she is. To make sure things go smoothly I'm gonna be sending Sasha back with you. Forgive me if I don't trust you completely. But I am Italian. Trust has to be earned and even then I don't trust you. But that shouldn't surprise you. Leo did you know his father's Italian? What does my father have to do with anything? Nothing. I wll be coming to New Orleans to finish up the paperwork. I will need a little time to make sure that every t is crossed. I feel sorry for her. Where is Mikey anyway? I don't know. Here's to a long and prosperous business relationship. And I know you'll see to it that nothing interferes with this.

You're right. Isabel? Ooh hey Ginger, I'll see ya later. Mom? Mom? They aren't home. So they left for the conference this morning? Nope. They left last night. So why was Isabel just here? Cause I wanted her to come over. I don't mean to get into your business but having your girlfriend over while Mom and Dad are out of town doesn't seem smart. Are you trying to get put out? You're right. It is my business. So I noticed you when you walked in the club. Just took my breath. You got beautiful hair. This gorgeous face. We do need to go out sometime, so I can get to know you a little better. All right? What's he doing here? I don't know, but I think he got a message for you. So why didn't he give me the message and leave? So I hear you have a message for me. I do. Diluca said he's coming to town on Thursday. And he wants to meet with you. Kevin's birthday. So you want me to reschedule? Nah, Thursday's fine. Hm, you were right. He isn't as dumb as I thought he was. I got things I gotta go take care of so I will talk to you later, all right? I hate that guy. Why does he keep coming around? Well technically he's still in charge until you sign those papers with Diluca. Well I could live with it.

I just need you to talk to Kevin. I tried but he wouldn't listen. I wouldn't either. You are dating one of your little brother's friends. That means they're about the same age.

That basically means that from the outside looking in the large sums of money that are delivered to you will appear to be perks and bonuses of capital gains of the business.

Tell David I said hello. Okay, see ya next time. Oh and Mikey did you ever get to talk to David? I know he was trying to call you. Yeah I saw that. I'll call him later. Okay I'll see you later. Tony, make sure she gets to her car. I know. Let me walk you to your car. Thank you. Honey, honey sit up straight. Well Michael now that you're here we can have dinner. All right Mom, what about Dad? Don't worry about your dad. He's been sneaking food out of the kitchen for the last 15 minutes. Your dad is so funny. Yeah? Yeah. And he loves you. I don't know about him but I think your mom may like me. Stop. They both like you. They like your entire family. Yeah. Speaking of family, what was Angela doing there? You were busy earlier. So I figured we go shopping. We got a chance to talk too. Well I'm not busy now. Yeah. I think we should start going to church together. There you go with that again. What are you talking about? Look every time you and Angela get together you start talking crazy. What's wrong asking you to go to church? What?! Because you start going to church does that make me so terrible? No! You don't think I know about church? My mom married the pastor. I know. I'm just saying I think we should get our lives right. Try and get our lives right? I don't hear you complaining when I come over at night. If you really wanted to change you would've said something about that. Trying to preach to me. You fake. I know I messed up. But that doesn't make this right. What's wrong with this? Look I thought this is what we both wanted. It's not about that. I just can't live like this. I'll tell you what, when you figure out what you want you let me know. What? Where are you going? Jeremy what uh, BC stand for man? Before Christ Chapel. Lord I don't feel like going to church today. Me neither. But I will. I want to talk to you this morning about the broad way. Some of you may say "Pastor what is the way?" Well that's the way you live of course. I want each of you to take a moment and think about the state or way that you find yourself in. Now for some of you that may be a bit confusing because you don't know which way you're in. You just let your appetite dictate whichever way you go. Or maybe you don't like the way that you're in today. You might sit up at night thinking of doing things to yourself wondering is this life worth living. Maybe you don't see anything wrong with your life. Everything is perfect, everything is good. There's only one problem, you can't stop touching your boyfriend or your girlfriend. Now I want to take a moment and talk to the religious people in the room. Because you see, religion will cause you to believe that this message isn't for you. But I have a word for you, this message is for you. The truth is hard to hear sometimes. Isn't it? But if you never heard the truth how would you recognize the way to life? What you have to understand is today people sin separates you from God. But that's why Jesus came to this world. He died and rose again so that you would able to choose life. All you have to do is believe in him. You see Jesus, is the only way. And I know you feel him knocking on your heart today. So here's the million dollar question. Are you going to answer his call? Are you going to leave him at the door knocking? Because who knows if this day won't be your last. The doors of the church are now open. I notice Alicia was in church today. She asked to come with us this morning. I told you how my wife has been reaching out to her since the wedding. I think they've gotten pretty close. That's good for her. What does Michael think about that? Well actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Mike has been Alicia a hard time. I knew I was talking to somebody this morning. Yeah? I think she really got something out of it. Well, anyway, I been trying to reach out to him. Just invite him over, have him around. I really believe that if he just stays around something might rub off on him. It's not like he doesn't know the gospel. Michael has to want to change. And God loves us enough to let us make the choice. I think this will be good. Just to get away for awhile. Yeah I'm glad you suggested it. Just how far are we going exactly? Seems like we been driving forever. It's not much further. We're almost there. How can you tell? Everything looks exactly, wait... did you see that? It looked like a woman. What are you doin'? She might need our help. Sasha I think we should stay in the car. This is crazy. Sasha! Look I don't have time for this. Sasha! Get away. Stay back. Please stay back. What's wrong? Go back, say you're sorry. You don't have to come here. What are you talking about? Stay away. They won't stop screaming. They won't stop. I hear them. I hear them always screaming. Who are you? You don't know. Has it been that long? Wait, you're dead! No! I can't die, it won't stop! What? The flames. They won't stop. It was just once. I was going to church. I didn't mean to. It was just one drink. He can't hear me. Who can't hear you? Jesus. Only he can save you. Remember. Remember what? I remember every moment I rejected him. I said, "it's just one lie, "a white one. "It's just one drink, "a small one. "I can get right later." But later never came. Sasha what is this? Mikey where do you think you're going? What's wrong? You scared? I'm finished with this. You can't just leave. Watch me. Looks like there's trouble in paradise. Everybody wants the good life, but nobody counts the cost. Don't worry Mikey, if I wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead. I came here to check for myself. To see how the operation was moving. But I see you've been making a few moves yourself. I don't care what you do with your own free time. Just make sure you take care of my business first. I did a lot to get to where I'm at today. And I won't let anybody mess with that. Keep a eye on him. Where are you going? Look I just need to get the hell outta here! Don't you get it? You can't leave. What you mean I can't leave? Listen I don't know what type of voodoo sacrifice stuff that you're into. Didn't you hear him Mikey? If he wanted to kill you he would have done it already. I'm not trying to wait around here to find out. Thanks Maria. Well done Francesca. Just got a couple more packages in. Need you to sign for it. Can I get a drink? What you havin'? Usual. But make it a double. Looks like you having a rough time cat. It's Mikey right? Yeah I'm Mikey. I don't believe we've met. We haven't. I'm just an observer. I like to know what's going on around me, you know. You got some real talent Mikey. But you sloppy bruh. This guy. Look, seems like you're havin a rough night. You ready to start making some real money, come holler. At a club uptown on Magazine street. That's where you can find me. I made you some coffee. Thank you. You know, I've been thinking about something a lot lately. About what? About Kevin and, and Michael. You know they've been spending a lot of time together. Yeah, I noticed that too. I just, I don't know what's going on with Michael. But I don't want Kevin to get caught up in anything. Well Michael's grown and Kevin's growing up. And it's about time he learns to make his own decisions. I know. But I'm their mother and I'll always be their mother no matter how old they get. I have a right to worry about them. You will always be their mother. But instead of worrying what we need to do is pray. Michael's been chasing the good life for a long time now. And that's his choice. But right now he's in a battle. The problem is all he can see is the world in front of him. And this isn't just about what he can see. This is a battle for his very soul. The choices that he makes now and the way that he chooses to follow in this life will determine his eternal destination. What we need to do is pray that the Lord will open his eyes to the truth. Well I pray that the Lord watches over both of them. One thing we know for sure is that we all have the power to choose life and not death, blessings and not curses. And with the first chance I get I think it's time I talk to both of them. You know, you're a really good father. That's why I love you. I love you too. Well I'ma let you get back to your study. Lord, please protect my boys. I know they're heading down wrong path. But today I pray that you would touch their hearts. I pray that you would touch them, and they'll experience your love, your power and your amazing grace. I'm letting go. And I'm giving it to you. In Jesus' name, Amen. I thought I told you it wasn't good for you to be in America. Se non e vero, e ben trovato. Leo you should know better than anyone, that sometimes in order to be felt you must be seen. Un imperatore invisibile e morto. Humph, quel ch'e fatto, e fatto. Precisamenta. So what's so important that you need to be seen? Sometimes your prolonged absence can cause your constituents to grow comfortable. A master often returns unexpectedly just to see if his servants have been faithful to complete the tasks they were given while he goes away. So you like people that you can trust to handle the business as if it's their own while you're gone. Exactly. The key to maintaining the business is never letting your people know where you are. If they know you are likely to come back at any time, they are more likely to take care of business. Michael? Why are you here? Can I come in? No, why are you here? I just wanna talk. So, talk. I been thinkin'. I'm not perfect. I have things in my life that I hold onto. The one thing that I know is right I let slip away. Mikey, I don't get it. Where's all this coming from? I know, I'm sorry. I just... Everything started to change. You started talking differently, and then you wanted to change. I just didn't think you had room for me in all of that. But you left. I'll be real with you. I thought if I stayed around I would have to give up everything that's important. I didn't realize that what was most important was right in front of me. So what are you trying to say? That I miss you. Mikey, wait. I can't do this. Why not? Don't you miss me? Don't you miss us? I do miss you. But I can't do this. I get it. You have changed. I'm sorry I came over. Hey this is Mikey. I'll take it in the other room. Okay. Hello? Mikey? Yeah. Hey I been trying to get in touch with you. I wanted you to come over. I know. You have a minute to talk? Is everything alright? No. When I started out all I wanted to do was help my family. I never meant for it to be like this. I don't even feel like the same person. I feel like someone else watching my life go by. Then I had this weird dream. I saw Jane. Jane? The girl that died? Yeah, she was in my dream. What, is somebody bringing that back up? I thought the cops cleared you of that. Naw, they did. The dream was weird though. It just made me think I need to change some things. It's like I was being warned away from something. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have bothered you. It was just so weird, I didn't know who else to call. Mikey look, I'm at home right now so maybe you should come over. We can sit down and figure some things out. I think God may be trying to tell you somethin'. You're probably right. I've got company over right now. I'll come by later. I gotta go. Hey. Yo it's Kev. Sorry I can't get to my phone. What's happenin' bro? Kevin. I gotta get in touch with, I got this message. Wait, hold on. Hello? Mom? Wait, slow down. All right I'm on my way. Hey we gotta get to the hospital, let's go. Excuse me, Kevin Hamilton, where is he? Kevin Hamilton? He's in the ICU. Sir you can't go in there. Sir you can't go in there! Kevin is unconscious, but he's stable. He's sustained serious injury to his spine. And we think he may never walk again. I'm sorry. I'll be checking on him periodically. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. Thank you doctor. Michael I know you're upset. But there's nothing you could have done about this. This isn't your fault. Yes it is my fault. I was supposed to watch out for him. I understand. But some things are outside of our control. God has a plan for everybody. God? You expect me to believe that this was a part of God's plan? There's nothing that you could have done to prevent this from happening. Whatever. Look... I don't think God would have my little brother laying in there almost paralyzed. And his girlfriend would not be dead. Listen Mike. There's nothing that we can do to bring Isabel back. Well what about you? God has a plan for everyone. What if you were in Isabel's shoes would you be ready? Don't worry about me. I'll be all right. No, I am worried about you. I don't know what you're into, and it's none of my business. Life is short. And the decisions that you make have everlasting effects. Are you finished? Because this is not about me. Well Michael, I only want what's best for you. I need you to understand that life doesn't always give you a second chance. It's precious. I love you Mike. And I'll be praying for you. Yeah? You keep praying for me. Mikey where are you going? Ginger, get outta my way. No. I don't know what you plan on doing but it won't change anything. Where's he going? I don't know. But whatever happened to Kevin, wasn't an accident. I'm sorry sir, you can't stop here. Just trying to see what happened. Well, two kids were involved in an accident. Looks like a drunk driver ran 'em off the road. But I'm gonna need you to move on. Where is he? May I help you? Sir, you can't go in there! SIr! Thank you, Lizza. Yes Mr. Diluca. Where is Fabian? You should have called first. I should've come in shooting first. Be careful Mikey don't let your mouth write checks that you can't cash. Where is Fabian? Listen Mikey, I don't know what's going on. Why don't you just go on home. We can figure this thing out after you calm down. Like I said, go home before I send you home. Well well, look who it is. What can I do for you Mikey? I need to talk to you. Yeah? So I guess you're ready to start making some then, huh? I have a couple things that need to be taken care of first. Couple things? Like what? Like Fabian. Fabian? Yeah? I think we need to take this conversation in my office Mikey. Right this way. Thank you. You're welcome. Did they say anything about his legs? They're not sure yet. We need to be thankful that he's alive. Right now we need to start thinkin' about how we're gonna to break it to him about Isabel. We have to be strong for him right now. I know, I just... I don't know if he's strong enough. I don't know if I'm strong enough. We're gonna make it through this. But this is already so much. What? If we tell him about Isabel, it's gonna break his heart. What's wrong with Isabel? Don't you hear me? Kevin they can't hear you. You're still asleep. Who are you? I was sent by the Father to come to your aid. The Father wants you to know that although you've suffered much pain you will live and you will walk again. And yes, unfortunately you heard correctly, Isabel did not make it. She did not have the chance to accept Jesus as her Lord and Savior. The Father sent his son Jesus to die for the salvation of His children and to return their hearts back to Him. Jesus freely gave his life for you. It's up to you to choose to follow Jesus, Kevin. Mom? Kevin are you okay? Jesus. Jesus, he's real. Yes I know. Mom I wanna change. I wanna do what's right. I wanna follow Jesus. Thank you for the information, Free. You can go. I'll look into it. Give us a minute. So? What? How do you plan to proceed? Well obviously we have to change some things. I agree. This Mikey kid is more trouble than he's worth. What do you propose we do about it? Mikey is difficult. I think it's time you terminate his contract. Well before you do that there's something you need to see. What's this? It's a bit of information I picked up on while doing some research of my own. So what's this mean? I think you know. This doesn't make sense. Nobody understood why I took so much interest in a random kid. But I didn't care. I watched out for him. Gave him a little business. I even took care of some of his business. You know the kid's got a temper. Says the wrong things to the wrong people. So I fixed it. They said it didn't make sense. What they didn't know is I knew his father. Why didn't she just tell me? What? Why didn't she tell you you was Mikey's father? I don't know, maybe she thought the reverend would be a better father. Or maybe she just lost your number. That's your business. I just thought you'd wanna know before we make a decision. So, what should we do? Girls. I'll tell you what Leonardo, I'll take care of it. Well Kevin I guess all we can say is it's a miracle. Congratulations Kevin. We'll let you spend time with your family. We'll be right down the hall if you need anything. Congratulations. I'll be right back okay honey? I'm gonna go talk to the doctors for a minute. What's up Kevin? How you feelin' man? I'm good man. They say it's a miracle. They say I'mma walk again. That's good. Do you remember anything from the accident? Did you see the driver's face? Do you remember the car they were driving? No. It all happened so fast. I don't remember anything. Don't worry man. I'mma be okay. Just tired, man. All right, get some rest. Michael? I'm really glad you're here, son. Kevin said an angel healed him and I'm inclined to believe him. Your brother almost lost his life. But God used that to bring him to salvation. Not everyone gets a chance like that. Listen I know you don't want to hear this-- Look if you know I don't wanna hear it then why are we talking about it? You have to choose which life you want to lead. I can't choose it for you. But just remember you won't live forever, Michael. Michael? So how you been taking all this? Like anyone would in my situation. Doctor says he'll be all right. They're calling it a miracle. How are you taking this? I'm fine. Well if you need to talk, I'm here. I'd like that. Like any good story, mine started with a girl. Kevin said he met an angel and his life was changed. I may have met an angel of my own and I'm thinking about changing some things. The pastor says that life is short and that I won't live forever. But I can't see myself growing old living like this. And then there's always that question. What if tomorrow never comes? Hey Mikey. Let's move team, let's move. We're losing him! Falling quickly. Man it's funny how lasting the effects your choices can be one decision can affect your entire future.
