Lyuzhni factory, 74. Yes, here! Comrades, count up. You are delaying the board. I am telling you for the last time. Labour exchange: 40. Just a minute, Comrade, and you will be at the Professors. Here is today's for you. Yesterdays has been delivered. Thank you. All the best. Good-bye. Are you here to see me? Yes, you. We accept subscriptions from may. Give me a cigarette. I do not smoke, and, actually, people do not smoke here. Where do you sleep? Here. On what? On the table. It is short for you. Yes, short. Hard. Hard. I can't when it is hard. My chest has been shot through I need straw or hay. Otherwise - I can't. Why is it so cold - no heating? We do heat. What do you want? To talk. To talk to you, Aleksandr. So you let me know what is going on. That is what I want. Who am I speaking with? Sorry? I said, who am I talking to? How prettily you speak. Anrei Nikitich. Kushler. There. I will be your boss now. How will we live? How will you live here with your health? People around untill night, like in the market. Meet Sanya, my sister. We died with her more than once, on the battlefields of civil war. Give us Komsomol Easter! We are Godless. Supersitious religion. Strange, look what I can do. Hairpin - Sovchuk. Hairpin. Sovchuk. See that? Look. Call someone else. For example, Syomka Gorodnizki. Syoma. Syoma. Gorodnizki. Wait! Sovchuk. Who are you calling? I won't tell you. Now it is clear. Can a komsomol-member eat keys? If they are very tasty. Even then, I think he can't. This question will be resolved by Semyon Gorodnitski. In my lecture, are you coming? Yes. I need to go home. My brother will be angry. I need to be educated. So Shura, let us go? Let's go. What a warm spring this year, isn't it. Amazingly warm spring, and you are shaking. Do not shake. I am not shivering, it is malaria. What a warm spring. And you have malaria. Let us go to mine. My brother will kill me. I will kill him, despite his hump. Zoya! Do you understand what I am saying to you? Have you calmed down? Well, Shura, will we eat the Easter-cakes? Easter-cakes turned out delicious today, son. What? Are the books yours? They are mine. Yes. These are old ones. Charskaya, Lukashevich. - presents from my dad. This one is interesting - Blok. Ahmatova. There. All works of Vladimir Mayakovski. Campanella. Mayakovski reflects my views most fully at this moment. Listen, where did you get Campanella? Someone brought it. I started reading it, but left it. It is a utopia. What? A utopia? A utopia. That is our future. Come here. Sit down. The City of the Sun - Thomas Campanella. Here... As we aim to improve the breed of dogs and horses. We ignore the breeds of the human race. Care to produce the best offspring. Is it clear? How can I explain to you? We must fight for creation of a new biological type. A human being of the future. You didn't get it? You need to be taken in hand. You know what. I am freeing this shelf. For real literature. The first book here will be Campanello. You will read it by saturday, is that clear? Have you read San-Simeon? You have not. Your fate can be improved. I will bring it tomorrow, ok? Sorry, I will just go see my Dad off, he is going away. Just a second. I am finishing an article now. It will be called &quot;The upbringing of young people away from families&quot; Or I will call it simpler &quot;The collapse of family&quot; In this article, my target will be your little vases, mats, table-cloths. It is all more fearful than Vrangel', understand me! We have to build a new way of living. What? One free from slavery. What is a family? Your family, for example. It is a hidden form of human slavery. For women, first of all. Luckily I grew up without a family. What do you mean, without a family? Just without one. I feel myself free. What? It's nothing. Is it yours? Mine. Leave it. Definitely yours? You are not lying? Why would I lie? The transfer of household from the family to society. Abolishes the need for a man to marry. The family unit is replaced my new higher forms of cohabitation. Men and women together. Care for children is no longer part of family, and becomes a government task. You are talented! I would not be able to write that. Oh, leave it. No way. A boy with a lower form of education studies a higher form of cohabitation. You will be published. Hello! Wait... Speaking. I have not finished it yet. It's allright, you will finish. Maybe no need to do this? Dear Comrade, may I speak to the editor? Hammer and Sickle. Listen, I have only written half of it. Don't be scared. May I speak to Comrade Akapyan. The editor Akapyan. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lord, and her musical chords. Yes, it is better that way. Are you working on subscriptions. Show me. How many forms have you completed at school? Two of the Church Parish school. That is not many. What are you saying? Come on! Move it! Oh, hi. Help her. She got hold of a bed for me, Dear Comrade. Bring it in. Put in in the corner. I told you I would get hold of one. Here goes. I will get hold of everything. Don't talk so much. We need plywood to make a barrier. I will find plywood too. You do not know me well yet. Come on, unfold it. Oh yes, meet Liza. Hello. Hello, Comrade Subscribers. Hi. Do you acknowledge handshakes. We acnowledge. Zoya. Shura. Zoya. Big Zoya and little Zoya. Make a wish, come on! Stand in the middle. Great girls, why do they walk past me all my life. Let us leave this place, Comrades. Where? I am leaving you forever. Old thief. If a person puts on a decent suit, you think that makes him bourgeois? I absorbed it with the milk of my mother, I have to dress decently. So you think I am bourgeois? You are young idiots! Diana Diana. Here is the form. Where is the 17 metres square room here? Yes, there is such a room. Where? Here it is. Thank you. Wipe your feet. Hey you. A sacred home. Enough with the old life-style, the oil stove and frying pans. Down with the press of the old regime! He adores me. You know, Hair-pin can do anything for me. What do you need all this for? You do not love him. What do you mean, why? Have some fresh berries, girls. Thank you very much. Don't you want such love, so that he will jump into water for you? No, that is not love. Real love is when you want to jump into water. Yes. No. Zoya, do not pretend to be selfish. I know you are no egoist. You are not like that, Zoya. Try it on! I know you are not an egoist I am! No. I am a terrible egoist! Excuse us please. We have intruded without any invitation. Congratulations on the new home! Just a minute. We came to you through staircases, some dark corridors. We brought you delicious cherries from our garden. Where are your articles? How old are you? Twenty. Almost. Have you read &quot;The love of worker bees&quot; by Kalantai. Yes. Well, Comrade Kalantai does not have firm positions. In terms of understanding the principles of free love. Finish it off, and we will publish it. You need to study. Comrades, you may sign up for manual labour at new building sites. Come to desk number 5. Zoya! Zoya! Hi! Hi there! Why are you at the exchange? I am waiting for my brother. If a lady has dropped something, the young man must pick it up. Yes, I am like a gentleman and you like a lady. Here. What are you doing here? Collecting boys to sell newspapers, and you? We are waiting for Comrade Pashin. What aquaintances you have! If my brother gets the job as the club household leader, I can be in the ballet group. You want to become even more beautiful. So what? I can waltz well, for example. I walk lightly too, don't I? There they are. Come on. Well, I wish you success. The labour exchange only signs up over-eighteens. Queue at the twelfth desk. Those illiterate are registered in room ten. Who is for wood-cutting? So, there is no such thing as love. No, not as such. There is friendship. There is physical attraction. What is love? It is the tendency of individuals to continue their species. Individuals? That is it. And your parents are individuals? I do not have parents. But you did. I did, but no more. Forgive me. What about happy families? I do not know what a happy family means. Simply a happy family. Only the wisdom of a new state. Can create such a family. Greetings, Vassily Nikolaevich. Hello. What is up with him? He is not well. Well then? They are not here? Can't see them yet. We won't wait. Come on, guys I will run. Here you go, come on. Leave me the boat. All right. I will sit with you. Here. Where does this paddle go? Let's go. Where is Zoika? What a ridiculous manner to be late. My dad is ill. Is that clear? Is this our boat? This one. Here. Why won't you declare your love for me? Shura, they all declare their love except for you. You are the only one. Really. Please. Declare your love. What if my brother sees? So what? If a woman has no right to be in charge of herself, her intelligence, her body. Then she is no longer a human being but an object of use. Kiss me. Stop here please, that is the house. This way please. Where is he? Syomka, hi! It is you? Yes. It's Syomka! Il'ya. Let me give you a kiss Marianna? Where are you, come on. Meet my wife, Marianna. Hello. This is my younger brother. You will treat him well? I will treat him well. She will treat you well. Come on, get ready. To go where? Where they tell you, Senya, you will live with them. You did not want to listen to me. Now your older brother has arrived, and I brought him to you straight from the station. I will not go anywhere, my friend has gone missing. Never mind. Your friend will not be lost, Ilya will find him. So you lived here all alone? Interesting, what would have happened to the Pioneer movement. If you had let this old Bourgeouis feed you up a bit. I told him: Listen, Semyon. Ilya came here as a judge, you must listen to him. Shura, where did you vanish? I am moving to my brothers. She has become beautiful. Yes. It is very hard for her to live. Because she is so beautiful. Aren't you cold here? Can it be that you like it here? I do like it. A lot. Artists have pleasant and interesting lives. So you think one should live for pleasure? You really think one should live for ones pleasure? Shura. Shura, what do you think? Should you live to work? Or work to live? I think you should work to live. What kind of Komsomol member are you if you think that? I do think that. What Komsomol-member are you after that? Girls, those who do not work do not eat. Everyone knows that. Well. The one who does not eat will not be able to work, girls. Enough. Only a philistine can live for pleasure. So you think one should not wear silk stockings? One should not. Patent shoes are also not allowed? Also not allowed. What about suede gloves and lace underwear? Zoya, do not let us think you worse than you are. What do you need all these outfits for? You are perfect as it isB I must go. Do not leave, stay with me. It is so joyfull and full of light here. I will cover with kisses your lips and eyes. I will cover with kisses. Stay with me. Before they used to be afraid to dress too well. And now look, earrings, a gold watch. It is all for show. We are the winners, and are sitting at the back? Having given up the front rows. Let them organise haberdashery shops and grocery, while we develop our own talents. Eventually we will be in the front rows and not them. Because this is the only tactic to escape destruction. Where was I before? Did you exist? You did exist. You were friends with Zoika. What has Zoika got to do with it? Do you remember, you dropped you handkerchief I picked it up. Remember how we met? I asked, then turned around and saw you. I love you. You are mad. I love you. You are mad. Want to hear a secret? You were the first human being on the planet to hug and kiss me. Since childhood? Come to mine. We will live at mine. How? Nonsense. But now I am alone. No. What, why? To love me. Do I not love you as it is? No, it cannot be so. I can't do it like that. I cannot be without you. You see, I cannot. When you leave for your work, what will I do? Vasya. I brought him. Hello, Vassily Nikolaevich. Move up. More. I invited you here for a serious discussion. I dare hope you are a decent person. I can judge that based on how my daughter treats you. As a decent person. I do not know. I think I am decent. Then promise. That my daughter does not find out about our conversation. The main thing is for Zoya not to find out, is that clear? It is clear. Not now, not ever. No matter how we finish our discussion. Very well. I am lying here and thinking. Modern young people marry early. Our previous way of doing things is no matter to them. If you were to marry now, I could go to my operation in peace. Zoya! Zoya, wake up! What is it? You could have fallen. I came to you. You are a good girl. You are perfect. He threw me out. They wanted me to marry Shepakin, imagine! I do not have the right to manage my body as I wish I am not a human being, but just an object to be used. Let us go. Can you imagine? To marry Shepakin! For this fiery tenderness I will reward you with a horse. You know what I will tell you. I have loved a lot. And was loved. I grew cold, and others grew cold to me. Even dumped I was. I was furious. Even shot at a duel. Everything has been. Now I say: you have gone to the fields forever. Let your name be holy. Sings: If I owned mountains made of gold. Yes, Comrade Author. Take it and read. Destroy family. Get lost! Dianochka, you missed me! You missed me, darling dog. Shurik, meet Diana. This is Diana! Hi Dearest! We have to become aquianted? Yes you must meet officially. We missed you all day. We waited for Shura all day. Zoya! Why did you get scared? What is up? Come in. Why are you shy? I did not want to disturb you. You are alone. I simply. Simply wanted to give Shura back his book. He is rarely here nowadays. He is mostly at the editors. I hardly see him myself. I am all alone Liza is at the Birthhouse. Is giving birth to a son for me. Congratulations. Thank you. That is how things are. Why are you like that? I am... I have a great sorrow. Our Daddy has died. Daddy has died. We sat down with her on the windowsill. She told me all her news. As though to a friend. To a friend. You know never fought in the war, what do you know? Can you value feelings the same way as I do? Sanya saw me dying in Velikoknyazheskaya Hospital. She said to me: you eyes are so blue. Where can you hide from that? And she healed me eventually. Not a bad nurse that was. Not bad at all. What about Liza? She said. You have a son. You understand? Dear Comrade. Not somewhere far, but in the Soviet Republic. Not like us, born in slavery. Nothing will stand in his way. No bumps in the road. Hello, Zoya. I have come. Kushlya told me. Well let us go. Let them study. Shura has come to us. Hello. I have been accepted to the Railway school. What about the pedagogical institute? Never mind. I think I will finish it. Now lots of people work and study. Yes. Not easy. Why won't Zoya come? She used to come all the time, and now didn't even attend the funeral. Mummy. For three years she would come. Mummy. Suddenly she stopped. When things are good for us, she is here. When things are bad, she is not here. Mummy. So that is how it is. Good-bye. Zoika, you know what. I really, terribly want for things... For things to be well with you, really well. It is true. Listen. What do you say about us, what do you think about it? You have not said anything. Yes... I forgot to say. I wanted to say that... I am very happy Zoya has finally left her family. I told her to leave that place many times. We offered her to live with us. But. She was never allowed to leave, you know that? I am glad. She is cheerful? Yes. You love her? Lots. She is beautiful. Really? You are so happy. Yes. What else can I add to my wishes? Always be as happy as you are now. Thank you, Zoya Diana! Wait. Go! Well, how are you? I am simply dying without you. So boring. Do you like my mirror? You like all this rubbish - beads, shells. Tell me. Listen, you signed up for ballet to wear all these dresses, yes? Did I guess right? Yes. Only don't tell anyone, all right? You wanted patent shoes, tell me, you did? You never had any. I didn't. We will buy some shoes for you I will work like a beast. Now the holiday season has started. - I will work in place of everyone. Me too. What? I have got a job too. Where? I will work as a waitress in a cafe. What? Yes, things must be bad for them if they invite you to work because you are beautiful. Like to that ballet group. But think about it. I don't need a tram I can walk there. I cross the street - and already I am at work. The money will come in handy. You will see me at once. I get so bored without you. One, two. Three, four. Twelve, thirteen... Come on. Thank you. Comrade Sebast'yanov. Your wife has kindly agreed to work in our cafe. We are very very glad. Well if she has agreed, let it be so. That's right. Of course, so be it. Excuse me, dear. Excuse me, I will just join you for a second. Young man. You really have nothing against Zoya Ivanovna working in a cafe? What is it to you? I simply wanted to warn you. There can be many people in a cafe. Zoya will always be visible. What do you mean by that? What do I mean? Do you not understand? Or are you pretending? Listen, you. It is you who should listen, naive boy. You do not understand what a woman you posess. Take her out of here immediately, right now. Leave today, do you hear me. Now, move to a different flat. Leave town to the devil. Listen you, go to the edge of the world. Do you hear me? Get lost. You've been to the mashine factory? I have. Given them the material? Yes. Tomorrow you will go to the village regarding this letter. Here, from Margarita. It is about the Lakidushnaya operation - sort it out I give you four days. Why aren't you happy. May I suggest another Comrade instead of me. I hear such words from you for the first time, Sebast'yanov. What is up? Due to family-related reasons. Family? Who do you suggest? We need someone with class instincts. Andrei Kushner. He is half-literate. I will help him. We look like Daddy, don't we? Terribly alike. Amazingly. Yes? Hands, feet - a copy of mine. The mouth is mine. Even elbows just my type. The eyes are mine. Andrei Andreevich is asleep. He is 15 days old. Look how it is. Our daddy will eat some herring. Daddy will eat some herring? Have you cooled the beer, Andrei does not like it warm. We cooled it, we did. God, how can it be warm? I have decided everything with Sanya. I am taking her away, to Margaritovka. You know how well people feel there. That is the right thing to do. Other than me, no-one would be able to collect the material. You get ready to go. As for nouns and verbs. You will help me? Now we will have beetroot-soup. See how it is? Smetana. Just a minute. Look what she is doing. Would you like smetana? I even feel the pipe calling. Which pipe? The pipe that calls for battle. Well, where are these people? Where are the people who have enough spirit to protect interests of the poor? Where? You for example Roman Kushler, you are our chairman. Listen, son, everyone is listening. You are our chairman. Tell us, did you grow up in poverty? Who are you friends with now? You are friends with kurkuls. Where is your brother, Andrei? He has gone to town. Due to the class hatred here. Andrei was promoted. He was promoted, why are you saying things in vain I am lying? I have been driven to being afraid to leave my children unwatched even for a minute. I am afraid. All right then. Shush, son. So there is the question. Who got the money distributed to those not owning horses? Who? Show us the documents and signature. Let everyone see, not just each other. Everyone knows, how corrupt you all are. Am I right? Yes! Will Petrechenko speak alone? Quiet. All right, talk. Calm down. Stay calm, citizens. You have scared the child. Come on, move up. That's it. Greetings. Hi, Brother. Hello, Comrades. Do not be afraid. I have an assignment to do here. From the newspaper. Come in Sanya. Don't be shy. You got muddy somewhere, it happens. I need to describe all your outrage. But because I know your troubles very well. Hi, Uncle Ignat. Each of you son-of-a bitches I can decipher even at night. For me to write the article is as easy as to spit. But we will do something different. We will write it together. How? Just like that. Well then. Comrade Mariya Petrechenko. Reveal all the lowdown, in front of everyone. Come on, I will write it down. Tell us. Who wanted to kill you? Give the surname. Kushler has been killed. In Margaritovka. Kolya and I are travelling there from the newspaper. You are going now? Yes now. When will you be back. Agapyan thinks we will stay for about three days. But then there is the long journey. I will go ask for leave. Zoya. Yes. Don't do it I leave immediately. Take care. Zoya Ivanovna. The handkerchief. What? You dropped you handkerchief. Excuse me. It is I. It is my fault. Sanya. You will go with me, Sanya. You will work at the editors. Recently we have drifted apart, but now we will reunite. We will get the guys around us. Sanya. Stop it. Dearest. So young and living alone? Without nobody. What do you mean, without nobody? There is a housefull of people. Where is your husband? What about the husband? You know, he really suffered from poverty. He was very literate. He needed a different kind of lifestyle, a beautiful one. A beautiful life. You know, for example he could not bear the sight of cockroaches. He was afraid of them. I told him, if it is not us, then who. Nor God, nor Czar or hero. For you everything is in the future. Who would marry me? With such a dowry. Just casually... I cannot allow myself, you understand? If I do let myself, there will be shouting and barking throughout Margaritovka-village. For others it is forgivable, but not for me. There will be growling and barking. About me and our whole poor family. Despite the Soviet government, that is not allowed. Not allowed at all. Comrade Sebast'yanov. I need to talk with you seriously. What is up? You have business for me? Yes. Come through here. Well. This way. Here no-one will disturb us. Come in. Be braver. Please come in. Speak. Comrade Sebast'yanov. I will try to be short. And just tell you one thing. We all wish you not to get too upset. Yes, maybe in the future you will be grateful for this happening. I would say, it happened in a timely fashion. Out! Shura! You are in my heart for ever. Do not look for me, I BEG YOU, do not look for me. Zoya. I will return this money to you. It is nothing, just by the way. No the main thing is here is the storekeeper. We will find him through the crime detection agency. Hello. Where is the material? What happened to you? Are you unwell? I am well. Then come on, go work. The life and death of Andrei Kushlya. Good day. I brought the fire-wood. If anything else is needed for the little one, don't be sad. So winter is here. Winter is here. Oh, hi there. Hello. Come in. We are always glad to see Semyon's friends. Haven't seen you in a while. You must be working a lot. Well, I won't get in your way. Hi. We have not seen each other for a long time. Long indeed. I have come to you on business and not for long. Listen. Maybe we should resume our status quo. Huh? I said, maybe. Your books and things should be moved back to mine? What objections can there be? Come here, girl! Where is your group leader? Zoika? Yes Zoika, where is she? Is she gone for long? She will be back soon. What is your name? Marikada. Marikada. Very well. What was your name before? Marusia. Marusia, listen. You know me. Very well. Whenever Zoya is back let me know, all right? Ok. Be well. We will decide who is at fault later, no time now. Now we must rescue our little sister urgently. Our little sister is in a bad mix-up. I told her to write you a note. But she said to tell you in person. I skipped and skipped, and skipped my way into trouble. All the way to prison. You are silent. That guy, the storekeeper. Turns out he is wanted. In some special lists. Did she know? She did not know anything. She would not have been affected. If she didn't go to register marriage with him, clever girl that she is. Through Gorodnizki, he is the prosecutor. If he interferes she will be gone in an instant. She says you are mates with his brother
