I don't know why you're so afraid of the real world. Because you're so oblivious. You're so in your head. You keep pointing fingers. Everything that's wrong with me, come on. I'm the big bad monster. No, keep it coming. - Aren't I, huh? - Well, right now, yeah. Just because I'm trying to love you because I'm trying to see where you're at with me-- You're trying to love me right now? - Yes. - This is loving me? Yes. I must be out of my fucking mind if this is loving me. Ha. Would you rather me just close myself off to you and then we could both be ghosts in the same room? I'm sorry, I think you need to leave the room-- Yeah, that's a great relationship. This is getting way out of hand. - This is getting fucking nuts. - This is real life. This is a real person trying to love you. Do you remember that first night at the park? Both of my sisters are older siblings. When I was really little, I wanted to be just like them, like, no matter what they were doing. So, one day I heard Natasha singing. So, of course, I started singing too, mostly alone in my room. But I decided to sign myself up for the school's talent show and I got in. No, I mean they pretty much let everyone in. - Okay. - But I was so excited to tell my mom. When I did, she was like, "Why would you do that? That's Natasha's dream. It's her passion, not yours." Anyway, I ended up not going to the talent show. And after that whole fiasco, I just became really... shy. I don't know, it's weird. I wanna hear you sing. - Oh, no. - Please? No, I'm really not good. And I'm not a singer. - Come on, sing for me. - No, I'm self-conscious. So? It's just me. - Oh. - Please? Mm. You suck. - Yes, yes. Seriously? - Just this once. - Oh, my gosh! - And it's never happening again. Oh, okay. But you can't look at me. Okay. I feel you looking. - What? - You're looking. - I'm not looking. - You're blowing this. Okay, fine, I won't. I won't. I won't look. I want you to turn around. Mm-hmm, completely. - Fine. - All the way, warmer. - I'm making my way. - Warmer. You're lukewarm. Okay, hot, hot. Oh, scorching, scorching. - Aw, aw, it burns. - Nailed it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this. Oh! ♪ Strike a match underneath me ♪ ♪ I've been ready to blow ♪ ♪ Time has pulled me back again ♪ ♪ I lost you once ♪ ♪ Won't lost you twice ♪ ♪ Light me up from the inside ♪ ♪ Burn enough once within ♪ ♪ Break me down to embers ♪ ♪ So I'll remember ♪ ♪ How to live ♪ Mm. Oh. - That was amazing. - No. No, Ari, really. That was like one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard in my entire life. Seriously. And I'm not biased at all, I promise. Really, really embarrassed right now. - No, what? Why? - Yeah. Don't be. Don't be. What's wrong? I get these all the time now. Get what? That's us ten months from now. We went to a bar called The Vault to celebrate your poem getting published and... And this isn't real. This is just a dream. I'm literally asleep. Nothing is real. None of this. Everything is just-- Fuck! God, this can't possibly be fucking real. I don't know what to do. Hey, hey, hey, don't do that. Don't do that. Please don't go. Please. I'm sorry. I fucked up. I don't know, I don't know where you are right now and I-- I'm gonna be better. I promise, I'm gonna be better. I, like, really need you back. Are you gonna remember me? Ari? Please say something!

My name is Ernest Hemingway and I'll be taking care of you. Yeah. Um, I need a coffee, black. It's no cream, no sugar. And of the salmon à la nage, without the clam sauce. And last time they burned the salmon. Make sure they don't burn it. No burning. All right. Thank you. - Right. You know. - Okay. Wow. Good afternoon. My name is Edgar Allan Poe and I'll be taking care of you. Would we care for anything to drink to get started? Yeah, Edward, I'm gonna get myself a glass of water with lemon, no ice. And the lady will be getting a diet ginger ale. Sparkling water with a splash of lemonade, please. So no ginger ale? No. No. All right. You're doing good, guys? Good afternoon. My name is Molière and I'll be taking care of you for the duration of your experience. The fuck is up with you? Edgar Allan Poe? Molière? Are you fucking kidding me? - Hey, Darius. - Where you've been? And do you still have a cell phone? If so, you don't use, it because I have to come here to see you. - Yeah, I've just been busy. - Right. How'd you figure out where I worked? I make a valid effort to keep this place a secret. Molly, from the Slam House rated you out. Molly knows all. - Of course. - Yeah. And speaking of the Slam House, you'll be there tonight, right? I got you on the list. Oh, shit, I completely forgot about that. Oh, shit. - I don't have anything. - Bullshit. - I don't have anything. - Oh, yeah. I got zero material. I'm serious. I'm sure. What? Yo, what's the name of that dark-haired waitress with the crazy cat eye? - That's Sadie. Why? - Oh, she's a brick house. Hmm, I'll be sure to put in a good word and hook you guys up. - Really? - No. Okay. Fuck you man, I don't need you to act as my, all right? Come on. Like, I'm serious. I'm not the only one who's concerned about you. I know. We all care about you, man. - I know. I'm fine, man. - Okay. Well, just an FYI, I'm putting you up tonight. - No, please don't do that. - Yeah, this is a courtesy-- Darius, come on, man. And I will have your award-winning burger with a side of Dijon and seltzer water, please, good sir. Hey. Ah! Hey! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Yay! Yeah! Ah! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Yeah! Whoa! Hey! Ha! Hey! Wow! - Thank you. Join us. - No, no, no, no, I can't. Come on, come on. Do something. Do something, let's go. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! - Thank you so much. - Thank you, thank you. - Hey, that was awesome, dude. - Oh, thank you. Do you live around here? Yeah, I'm just up a couple blocks. That was a lot of fucking money you threw down. Oh, they we really good. And plus, it's from my calendar. - What? - My calendar. Oh, okay. I'm Phoenix, by the way. Phoenix? Yeah, like the bird. - That's cool. - See ya. Yeah, I read the script. The script's great. Pitch? Old school versus new school, and together they save the world. Right. Everybody loves spy movies. Listen to this. They asked me how do I feel about making Robert De Niro the British doctor. De Niro with an English accent? Right. It's kind of like Forrest Gump. It has that romanticism. It's like, what's that other movie? Basic Instinct. It has Basic Instinct undertones. Really dark, sexy. And anyway, the meeting is over, and Harvey Gross, yes, that Harvey Gross invites us to lunch. He loves it. He says, "Kid, I'll make your picture." You're gonna love it. What's your email again? At Hotmail, right? Uh... I gotta take this. Here's to the wicked witch of the west. Here's to the witch we love the best. That's you, bitch. - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! Excuse me. Am I dreaming right now? I think you've had a little too much to drink. - It's ginger beer. - I'm sorry? It's gin-- It's non-alcoholic. Okay. What do you do? I'm a real-estate developer. - That's cool. - Yeah. Uh, you? Writer. Uh, I like to write. A writer who doesn't drink? Must be awful. Yeah, pretty much. Cheers to you, man. "I will wake up to you one day. We'll leave a note creased in between your forearms. In between the folds it'll read, 'I love you now.' I first fell in love with your hands. You are a man who will be known for his hands. I saw you standing there speaking with them..." "...begging for his fingertips, his hands clinched to the strings of me, I am a fleeting black balloon amidst the wind take flight with this moment and ask me, 'Why do I love your hand so much?' Ask me if I could love them, then shouldn't it be so easy to love you like you all I got? Like we don't wait to touch, like hold me, like love me back like that, like our hands are only the exact reflections of the baggage they carry." "The privilege of being able to say that I-- I am indigenous, I am one part Mayan and another Taíno. The privilege of being able to say that my ancestors built great pyramids to touch the clouds and count the stars in the skies to make calendars before your white scientists ever had a chance to. The privilege of being able to say that my ancestors rose from the ashes of their own flesh, that their skin is my skin, and that you could hang us, grill us, chop off our hands and feet, chase us down with hounds. Our skin is resilient. And we will always rise." Oh, my God! All right, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. There we go. All right. Okay, so next up, we got my man Hunter. Now, this guy is the real deal. I promise you, he's the real deal. Okay, so I'm not gonna talk too much. Hunter, please, come here my man, Hunter. Come on, Hunter. I know you're here. Where are you, baby? Hunter, please, don't do me like this. Hunter. Bring Hunter out, come on. Man. Damn. All right, that's fine. No show, no worries, we'll keep it moving. Okay, guys, this next girl is fire, literally. Give it up for my girl Phoenix, please. Instructions on how to put out a fire. "Drown her. Surely you don't want her to continue to burn, right? Hose her down. Dim her light. Muffle her spark. Make sure her voice doesn't spread too far. When I was 13, I had not yet become a woman. I knew how to cook and clean, wash and fold, didn't always do what I was told. I learned how to mop at six. But mopping up damaged souls off of floors ever since, but I still wasn't a woman yet. At 13, I grew a tongue. My mother threatened to cut it out. It was sharp and bold, always locked and loaded, ready and quick to aim. Fire all spark to show and prove, cold, steel, and power. Pistol popping firecracker always at close range. Filters were for children, but child I was not. But I still wasn't a woman yet. I want to huff and puff and blow this house down. I remember the first time he set it on fire with both me and my mother in it. His hands, a piping torch. His voice, a destructive bomb, always prepared for explosion, Fahrenheit. There was no warning, no detector to alert us. First degree was warm, tolerable. Second degree, we were blistering and boiling. By third degree, we were charred, numb. This is what homelessness feels like. Should I give birth to a daughter? She will be a river, a free-flowing healing stream. I want her to stay girl forever, but this is impossible. I want her life to flow with ease, no becoming a woman until she is ready. She will not clean, wipe or mop up anyone else's mess. I will be sure of it. I will be the refuge, the sanctuary, and she will be the stream, free to flow wherever she may please. She will be the house to hold all of the good memories and all of the good things that I never had." Oh, hey. Hey. It's you, the calendar guy. - Yeah. - What's up, guy? That was amazing. Oh, thanks, dude. Seriously. Incredible piece. - Thank you. True story. - Wow. Hey, you-- you never told me your name, calendar boy. Hunter. Hunter, like-- like the guy that they called to the stage that never went up, Hunter? No, that wasn't me. That was, uh... I like to come here to hear to everything. Mm-hmm, okay. Anyway... Great job. Hey. Do you remember my name? Phoenix, like the bird. I remember when we met at the Slam House. You had this poem. It was like I was the only person in the room, and you were saying it directly to me. Are you listening to me? Ari, can you hear me? We interrupt this broadcast with a poem brought to you by yours truly. I call it, Vanilla Latte. "I listened to all your old voice mails the other day. The last one I played twice. How long do I have to wait for this drink to cool down before I could sip again? Reset. Gentlemen, we're back. What can I do for you? We're all but pawns in a game of chess that we call a life. Everyone needs to calm down. I'm not saying it's..." Hey, quiet. Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on? What's wrong? My boyfriend broke up with me. I'm really sorry. I mean, we were together for a whole year. First guy I was ever in love with. I thought we were doing amazing-- I mean, I thought we were doing okay. I just-- I don't know what happened.

Hey, brother, how you doing? You have a dollar or anything to spare me, please? Sir, do you have a dollar, anything that you can spare me, please? Hey, you guys have anything to give? Anything? Please. Sorry. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, sir, how you doing? My name is Garry Holmes, I'm 33 years old, I-- I don't have any place to stay. Do you happen to have a dollar or anything that you can spare me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. - Here you go, man. - Thank you so much, sir. - All right, have a good one. - God bless you, right. - Yeah, you too. - How you doing, sir? I hate to interrupt, do you have anything? Spare change? Good afternoon. My name is Tartuffe and I will be taking care of you for the duration of your experience. - What the hell's wrong with you? - Hey, Darius. What was this shit you pulled last night? Oh, man. Do you know I gave you an introduction and everything? Like, I called your name like a dozen times. I know, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just didn't-- I was not-- I'm trying to help you, Hunter. I mean, I was there, I just wasn't feeling up to it. Turn it into art, man. Come on, you gotta do better, you know it. - Yeah, I know, I'm trying. - You're trying? - Yeah. - Waiter? I just... didn't feel like going up. So... Waiter? You're on my naughty list. - Oh, no. - Yeah. - Not that. - Yeah. Excuse me. So you just come here to make me feel bad or what? I wanted you to give this to that Sadie girl. I wrote her a little something-something. Are you kidding me? - What? - Seriously? You can just go up to her and give her that yourself. What about being your own catalyst and all that? - Oh-- - Can you not hear me, dude? Come on. It's the least that you can do for standing me up last night. You're not gonna let that go, right? - No. - Give me that. Would you be having anything else, sir? No, Mr. Tartuffe. But I will take all of the complimentary bread and seltzer water you would have to offer me. - Big spender. - Yes. You want with it? Lemon. Coming right up. Hey, Tartuffe, I didn't order this turd on this plate. I want a filet mignon butterfly well done. I don't wanna see any pink because pink reminds me of my ex-wife's left titty. And I do not wanna be reminded of my ex-wife left titty while I am eating! I want tater tots and I want lemon ice box-- Sir, could you take it easy on my best friend? He's had a very long day. You take it easy there, long day precious. I'm eating here. I'll take that right out of your way for you. - Well, hello, lady. - Thank you, Sadie. And I want some ketchup with those tater tots. Sure thing. Free range chicken, my ass. Cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo. You've heard that. My man Hunter. ♪ Daylight ♪ ♪ Daylight ♪ ♪ Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight ♪ ♪ I got daylight ♪ ♪ Daylight ♪ ♪ Daylight, I got daylight, I got daylight ♪ - Hey. Hey, there. - Hey. What are those? They're called smile cards. It's just like little random acts of kindness that you can do for yourself. That reminds me of my calendar. You got a smile card calendar? Yeah, kind of. Hmm. This one right here says, uh, "Give away something that's important to you." That's my son's favorite card. - You got a son? - Yeah. He's-- He's actually at school right now right around the block. - Really? - Yeah. It's amazing, 'cause he's growing up so fast. It's just like speed of light, man. Yeah. Every day we-- we pick a new card, we try to live it throughout that day. Right now, we're working on building the foundation to understand that what's important comes from inside, not the material world. He really loves them, and his comic books. - He likes comic books? - Yeah. I used to read a lot of comic books when I was a kid. - Really? - I did, yeah. I would pretend that I was one of the characters from that universe and I would try to help the protagonist, save the world and all that. Like the guardian of the galaxy. Yeah, kind of. You know, you should have this. It's yours. - Thank you. - Thank you, man. - It's Garry, right? - Yeah. Hunter. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, man. Hey. Oh. What are you doing here? The door was open. - When did you get back? - Just now. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. No, I said some terrible things to you. You didn't deserve that. Well, it's okay. How are you? I miss you. I miss you too. I'm sorry, I can't-- You're here. You are really here. Hunter... we should break up now. - Yeah, he cheated on her. - What? Yeah, dude. He was fucking that granola girl, Eternity. - What? - Yeah. Dude, I'm fucking Eternity. - Fuck off! - Yeah. - I'm fucking Eternity too, dude. - What the fuck? Oh. - Come on, dude. Next is on me. - Love you. She doesn't depend on agents at all, and now he feels he's losing control over Lauren too. Macallan 18 neat, please. What? He thinks I have something to do with it? Come on. Look, he's an easy target, first time director-- - My tab. - Sorry, sir? Let's-- Hold on, Casey. Put it on my tab. Please. You know he's not actually talking to anybody? - Are you serious? - Uh-huh. Guy comes in here four or five nights a week like clockwork, orders a top-shelf scotch and then gets on the phone, starts throwing industry buzzwords around to ruffle feathers and impress girls. It's all bullshit. There's nobody on the other end of the line. - It's wild. - Yeah. - Why does he do it? - No idea. Batshit crazy like everyone else in this town. Get you another ginger beer? Oh, I shouldn't. I'm driving after this. - You know that's not alcoholic. - Yeah, I know. That was my attempt at humor. - Oh, I got you. - I'll close out. Sure, man. "I wanna pull you in so close that I can feel your heartbeat. I feel that bang against my chest like it's the one inside me. Irregular, never steady, but it's pumping just enough to love, girl, so I'm just hoping that you love me. And if you don't, well, that's okay, 'cause we both know that me, compared to you, is like comparing anyone to conversation starter. But the end results are the same. You are ten and I'm an eight, I'm playing catch up to you, babe. Honestly, you are gentle, you are special, you are delicate, beautiful and well-equipped, brains and so intelligent. What is the connection if the spark don't start developing?" "Who are we as we dance while they drop bombs on our heads? You have known humans like us, cursed to lean on a rotten pine slab of wood you forgot that we are sentient. You failed to remember what gasoline does once inside of the body. Something like crack cocaine or white phosphorus, it clears life so that death may join us for tea. And how unlucky you are that he's on our side now five. When I am happy, I'm only allowed a moment before the guilt begins to settle..." - What's up? - Hey. What are you doing? I don't know. Okay. - How is it in there? - It's fine. It's a light night. - You performing again tonight? - No, I'm sitting this one out. Just too many emotions flying around. So you're just sitting out here? Yeah. Good times. Hey, are you coming in or what? Uh, I don't know. If you're feeling the poets, I want you to snap, but I want to you say, "Mm." - Snap, snap, snap. "Mm." - Mm. Mm, that was so sweet. Right? Okay, cool, listen to be inspired, have fun and just be open, okay? Here we go. Come on! "I can make him beg for the conversations we could have had. You see, when I was young, I always thought I had to choose between being a lightning bolt and being the rain, not realizing the most colored cats are cumulus clouds that if you change the atmosphere, each one of us can become a thunderstorm capable of striking the stubborn tree and watering the willing grass in the same breath. So let's just get this straight. I am not the only smart kid from the hood. I was not the only Christian kid in Compton. I'm not the only black boy with a good father. I am nothing, I am nothing but a product of God's infinite grace and mercy. And trust me when I say, every day... He's still working on me." All right, all right, all right. There we go. - Hey, do you live alone? - No. Yes, I do. Okay, well, then let's hang out. I wanna see your place. I don't know, it's late. Maybe another time. So you do write. Oh, yeah, a little bit. Is this the infamous calendar? - Yeah. - "Do good things." Whoa. Dude, you did all this? Yeah. Wow. You're really going all out. You wanna be Saint Michael or something? What's your MO? Are you trying to, like, score a humanitarian award? - Uh... - I'm kidding. It's cool. Oh, careful with that. It's old. Oh, wow. - Oh, hey-- - What do we have here? - Oh. - Who's this for? Is this for your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. Bullshit. Yes, you do. You totally do. And you just didn't want to tell me. - You're fucking sketchy, dude. - Please, can you just-- Or do you just keep an engagement ring - in here just in case? - Phoenix. I'm just asking. What? You can't tell me? Yeah, it was-- It was intended for her, but-- But-- But she wasn't the one? I'm sorry, I really don't wanna talk about this. It's getting late. Sorry, dude. I thought she was the one. I, like, really did, but... She wasn't ready for something like that. And honestly, she didn't even know I had it. - Sorry. - It's okay. I should probably talk about it more openly than I do. Where is she now? I don't know. She went-- went away to go find herself. That's what she told me. Well, she didn't tell me. She left me a note. Honestly, I think my commitment might have scared her. Yeah, maybe. Have you talked to her since? No. I think she threw her cell phone away. What? What? I'm sorry, but you think just because she won't talk to you she threw away her phone? Yeah, I do. I think she, like, left the country and burned all of her possessions or something. - Really? - Yeah. What? I'm speculating a little bit, but that's what I think. You're so ridiculous. Do you have anything to eat? - Like food? - No, like soap. Yes, like food. I'm starving. So where do you live? Well, I'm kind of in between places right now. And what does that mean? Um, it's kind of a long story. I'll give you the abridged version. I moved out here seven months ago with my boyfriend John, which turned out to be a total bust because he was sleeping with this other bitch who got him addicted to heroin. And so I left and started staying with a girlfriend for about a month. And then after that, I floated over to another guy friend's place. And then after that, on to the next and then the next. Repeat. - Wow. - Yeah. Sorry. I'm kind of tired of telling the same story to every new person I meet. So where are you staying now? Mm, I was staying with this guy named Dimitri. I met him in a gallery opening, but he got kind of weird. So I dipped out this morning. He still has most of my shit. He doesn't actually know that I'm over it yet, so I'm just gonna go over there and grab my shit and leave. Oh, okay. Where are you staying tonight? Oh, um... Well, I guess I could probably call up some people and see if I can stay with them. You realize it's midnight, right? Yeah, but it's probably fine. No, I-- I-- I can't let you do that. What? Like gamble whether you have a place to stay or not. It's weird, it's late. I don't know. I wouldn't be comfortable with it. Okay. Plus, it's 12:05, so technically, it's Wednesday. I could have you in my calendar for today. The DGT calendar? I made the cut? Yeah. So basically it's a win-win. Sweet. Oh, okay, um-- - You coming in? - I just thought-- I don't know. What, you want me to sleep on the floor? No, no, this is, um... This is good. Yeah. Do you always sleep with your jeans on? Sometimes. You're so funny, dude. Goodnight. Goodnight. It's not gonna work, Hunter. Trust me. Look, have you tried a signal flare? You can see one of those 40 kilometers away, day or night. I don't have a signal flare, man. Okay, well, have you tried calling her name out really, really loud? Yeah, for hours. Damn. Hey, can you do me a favor? I need you to give these to that Sadie girl. Those are the keys to my apartment. Don't lose them. - Okay. - Cool. Thanks. Look, when in doubt, rub one out, all right? Okay. - Aubrey, it's Hunter. - Hey, what's up? I'm really not feeling well today. I don't think I should be near food or people. - Oh, no. Stomach pain? - So, I-- Okay. Do you need someone to cover? - Okay. - I can cover. Thank you.

Are you still on that? Not yet, but I will be. Great. I'm thinking about bringing her to the Slam House to watch you perform like you do. - So are you sick or not, man? - I don't know. Okay, well, are you gonna come tonight? I'm not sure. Hey, man, can I call you back? No, no, you can't call me back. All I want is an answer from you. I'm gonna go. - That's it, man. - Sorry, hanging up. I'm not asking for too much, Hunter. Bye. Oh, fuck. What are you doing? Your door was open. You can't come into my apartment like this. What happened to your face? Dimitri was here. You just missed him. - Shut the fuck up. - Nope. That's your stuff in the box right there. - He brought it over for you. - Did he do that to you? How does he know where I live, Phoenix? Phoenix, how the fuck does he know where I live? I'm so fucking sorry, dude. I-- I told him that I was staying at another friend's place, but that fell through 'cause my friend backed out at the last minute, so I just gave him - your address and your name-- - Oh, my God. But I told him to leave the box outside. I'm so fucking sorry, dude. Fuck, I'm gonna kill him. - Why would you do that? - I made a fucking mistake. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to drag you into anything. No, no, it's fine. It's-- I'm a little rocked. I didn't mean to raise my voice. I'm sorry. I just didn't expect to get sucker punched on my way home at my home. You can totally hate me. I understand. It's fine, I don't hate you. He has your paintings, by the way. He says if you wanna get them back, you're gonna have to get them personally. Motherfucker, he can have them. I mean, yeah, but those are your paintings. You should probably get those back. It's whatever. You hate me. I'm gonna go. - Where? - I don't know. I'll figure it out. Phoenix, wait. Phoenix. Can we just sit here for like a second? Please. Okay. Do you think he's gonna come back? If he does, I'll fucking kill him. Don't do that. - I'm really sorry. - Don't be, it's okay. Well, I-- Tsk. I finished your cereal. - You finished my cereal? - Oh, fuck. Yes. - Oh, my God. - And I'm so sorry. No. This is not chill. - What? - You just crossed a line. Oh, no. What happens now? I don't know, but it's not gonna be good. Ooh, I'm scared. You should be. Look, I'll buy you more, though. - It's fine. I'm playing. - Okay. This hurts. You-- So right now you look like a walrus because you have this tusk. It's-- - Thank you. - It's too soon to make jokes. - Yeah, yeah, it was. - I'm so sorry. It's okay. Okay, uh... - What are you doing? - Um, there. That's not gonna do anything. Yes, it will. It does in movies. So what now? I'm not gonna go out anytime soon. Yes, you can. I'll be your bodyguard. Oh, great. Do you want, like, any ice or-- No, I'm okay. I'm being a baby. It's fine. Yeah, you are. Ooh, I know. Oh, fuck, he better not have taken it. Yes, this is gonna help you feel better. - Oh, no. No. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry, I don't smoke. - Yes, you do. - No, please. - Famous last words. I've done it before, it was not my thing. Listen, this is gonna help you, so you're gonna smoke this with me. Peer pressure. Come on. Ah. Okay. Yes. Yes. - I'm gonna regret this. - Oh, my God. - Just I don't-- - You don't need two hands. - It's not that heavy. - Okay, I don't know. Careful. No. Bad idea really. No, it's good. Coughing is good. It hits you when you cough or something. What are you doing? What are you doing? Just relax. Virgin lungs. No more for me, please. I'm-- - Do you feel any better? - I don't know. Good. What movies do you have? - This is crazy. - This is stressful. Hey, I have a confession to make. Wait, say it into the mic. Shh, shh. - Say it in the mic. - I-- I still have the quadratic formulas memorized. - Shh. - Shh. - X... - It's okay. ...equals the opposite of B plus or minus the square root of-- I can't make that sound. Wait, give me one more try. I can't, my lips are numb. What if it was-- Okay, wait, what if it was a vacuum? - I can just-- - See if it worked. Brrr. It's not working. - Useless. - It's not working. Fuck that elephant. No way I brought that. I really literally don't know why I brought that with me. - Why-- Why do you have that? - I thought I would need it. I almost had it. Don't get it on the couch. Am I having a heart attack? Am I? I don't know, man. I'm not a doctor. Useless. Oh, fuck you. I got you, bro. Who is she, Hunter? Okay, so tonight we have a very special guest. Give it up for Miss Ariana Granger! I wanna dedicate this to someone who couldn't be here, but I hope it echoes loud enough for him to hear. My last song. "I'm done. And how many times did I swear this was the last time. The verse, the eulogy, the praise, the bridge, the hook. And how many times did I try to convince him to make a home with me. Then, oh, the chorus. But love still always ends with... 'I'm done.' The hook. I've known this to be its translation. A fib, a fable, as if I could wash my hands of the blood, as if I could omit the sacrifice. I created a civilization. If I'm done under my tongue, not because I could not, but because I would not anymore. Everything is dead here. Tears are entombed at the bottom of the sea. Hope and second chances are lost. I welcome the drowning. The bridge. If this is the last song, if I am the lyrics, you are the note. I could drown in your melody. It took... ten sunsets before you said you loved me. Nine months later, I gave birth to your smile. Eight times a day we would talk. I thought seven mornings was enough to watch the sunrise with you. Six times a day you made me scream your name. Five seconds was all it took for us to break. Four weeks later, you sent me flowers. Three days later, they died. Two years, and neither one of us is happy here. So give me one good reason... why I should stay. Oh, shit. Oh. - Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. - Oh, dude. - Oh. - Dude. - You scared the shit out of me. - I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. The worst dreams last night. Yeah, you were talking in your sleep. Well, I need you to do me a favor. Okay, yeah. I need you to slap me. - Slap you? - Yes, please. It has to be you. No, I'm not gonna do that. Phoenix, please, just slap me. Dude, get a grip. Dude, just fucking do it! Fine. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Do you want another one? - No. Oh, and by the way, sex last night was amazing. We had sex? No, I'm fucking with you. Oh. What did we smoke last night? It was this sativa-indica hybrid. It puts you on your ass. Yeah, I'll say. No more for me, thank you. Hey, I got you some more cereal and some actual groceries. Oh. Thank you. I don't remember anything from last night. That's a common side effect, you'll be okay. I'm not hitting you again, though. Unless you deserve it. I had a really strange dream too. Every dog on the planet was trying to get to me so they could kill me and eat me, like, every single dog in the whole fucking world. And so millions of dogs were, like, drowning in the ocean crossing over from other continents and shit. It was wild. I don't know what to make of it. - So what are we doing today? - Oh, uh... I need to find something for my calendar. Can't I just take up two days in a row? - No, that's not how it works. - Why not? I can't put you down twice for the sake of putting you down twice. That's lazy. But you let me stay here twice. This is not how it works, Phoenix. Okay. Don't you have something to do today? Like what? Like, I don't know, finding a permanent place to stay, a job, getting your paintings back from that Dimitri guy. I don't mean to sound harsh, I just-- I don't get any sense of urgency from you. Oh. What, like-- like I just use people? No, I'm not saying that. I just don't really think you're living in reality. Seriously? And you are? Well, I mean, I'm sorry if I've been an inconvenience. I thought we both just needed a distraction from all the bullshit, but I guess I'm just making things shittier. No, no, that's not what I'm saying. Maybe you're right, though. Maybe I should start thinking about those things. - Wait, Phoenix-- - Don't touch me. - I'm sorry. - Look, uh... You seem like a really cool guy, dude. It's-- It was good to meet you, but just, like, try to stay above ground. Oh. Phoenix, hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said. Yes, you did. But that's okay. You should say what you feel. Hunter, thank you for letting me stay here. I wanted to tell you that earlier. And... I know we just met, but didn't it seem like we had known each other for a while? Yeah, it did. Weird. See you at the Slam House sometime. Why don't you give me your apron and I will show you some decent customer service? Would that help? We all care about you, man. Turn it into art. What's important comes from inside, not the material world. I love the way he portrays the mind pulling against time and reality. It was good to meet you, but just, like, try to stay above ground. Would you rather me just close myself off to you-- I'm trying! Excuse me? I'm sorry. What is your name? I wanna talk to your manager. You know what? Be my fucking guest. I am so sorry about that. - Darius. - Hello? I don't believe this. What day is this? I gotta be documenting this, man. - You know this is-- - Hey, man, listen, please. - What's up? - Um... I need you to do me a favor. What do you need, man? Do you remember that gallery opening that you hosted at the Slam House? Yeah. Why? I need some information on one of the artists. Yo, let me get But what's this all about? Him, he's the one. Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry, I couldn't help but notice what you're reading. - Oh, it's Lighthead. - Yeah by, um... - Terrance Hayes. - Terrance Hayes, right. - It's one of my favorites. - No, it's excellent. Yeah. I love the way he portrays the mind pulling against time and reality. Definitely. Wow. You know, you might like The Bell Jar. - The Bell Jar. - By Sylvia Plath. The Bell Jar. It's spectacular. Wow. I should check it out. Well, thank you so much for the recommendation. - I appreciate it. - Yeah. It was nice meeting you. - You too. Have a good one. - Bye. You too. - Are you Hunter? - Yes. All right, get in. So how's your day going? It's good. It's just another day, right? Yeah, I feel you. So what do you do? I'm sorry? You know, what do you do? Darius gave you my address? Don't worry about it. What's up, pretty boy? Hi. How's that nose? It's great. Is she here? Damn. Damn. She run away from you too? I'm here to get her paintings back. Ah, fuck no. Hell no. Fuck no. I told you that she has to come pick them up personally from Dimitri, right? I'm not gonna leave without them. Boo! Shit. - Come on, man. - You're fucking hilarious, bro. Like, fucking hilarious. Okay. They are inside, come get them. - They're inside, come get them. - Okay. Dimitri. Want a beer? No, thank you. You're like a martini man. Dimitri. - Dimitri. - Yes, grandma. Can you make us some dinner? Yo, you sure you don't want a beer? Yeah, I'm good, man. Check this shit out. My grandma gave me this. - It's pretty sexy, huh? - Yeah, it's nice. Fuck yeah, it is. I use it to carve etchings like this, man. You can find it in Dimitri's gallery. - That's cool. - Fuck yeah, it is. This is high-performance surgical steel. I'm thinking about getting a quote engraved on the blade. - You know what it's gonna say? - Hm? It's better to flee than to die. That's great. You should do that. Wouldn't that be dope, like, on the side right here? Yeah. You wanna hold it? Oh, no, I'm good, man. Come on, man, hold it. It's actually pretty light. I really don't wanna hold it. I'm sorry. You know, you're being really rude, bro. I'm sorry. Why can't we just be friends? We can be friends. We can totally be friends. No, you don't wanna be my friend. You're just saying that. I do. I totally wanna be your friend. - Really? Do you mean that? - Yes. Let him go, Ricky. You fucking spaz. Let him go. I was just joking around with him. I love this guy. Those are the paintings? I mean, yeah, these are them. Um... - Are you sure you want? - Yes. No, bro, I mean, like, are you sure? - These are her paintings? - Yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll take them. Hey, man. You came back after I popped you. That's what's up. Okay, thank you. - I'm gonna go now. - Hey. Hey, she makes people crazy, bro. Shut up, Ricky. But she does, all right? Yeah. Take care yourself, pretty boy. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Nice meeting you. See you around the neighborhood. Let's hang out soon. "Let's hang out soon"? First you were gonna cut him. Now you wanna hang out? Everything is all taken care of, it's all laid out there. The deal was done. Oh, really? That's what he's gonna do. Really? Oh, that's his intention? No, no, no. Then you talk. No, no, no, you talk. Yeah, you talk to him and let him know. I'm done. "A face of shame covered with accusations on her tattered garments written by the abusers, the righteous ones of John 8:7, come with stones to judge and condemn. As if emotional toil did not suffice..." My shift's gonna start soon so I have to dip, but thank you so much for inviting me. - This is awesome. - You're welcome. - So next week? - Yeah, for sure. Good night. "...her ears as she passes by. She walks defiant in her stride shouting, 'Mistress am I. Mistress am I. Mistress am I.'" When you see Phoenix, can you give these to her? - Yeah. - Thank you. And thank you so much for that address, man. - I owe you. - Bro, you do owe me. Look, I'm gonna go ahead and do this thing. Can you go back there quick? Hunter. Hunter. Wow. Hey, man, take your time. "Sometimes I mourn the dawn. I choose to remain fragmented until sundown, until dark because that is where I like to hide. And one day a bird will be burning. It will be on fire blazing at my door. And by this time, I'm so tired of drying crying girl's tears. And deep down, I just wanna tell her to go the hell away, but then... maybe I wanna be on fire too. And she will teach me to rise from the ashes again, kind of like the sun, how it also rises and wakes without an alarm or a bell that tolls. I wanted to spend midnights riding under the moon and get drunk in the month of you, and then scratch out your name wherever it may exist. I wanna burn the same and... every fucking last inch of it, and then bury its frail and lovely bones into a magnificent lover's grave. This is a tale of hearts. I need to write or tell a tale, but what good is a fairytale if it does not have a heart or a happy ending? Is it rubbish? What good is a body if it does not live life? What is kindness? What is being brave? You wanted me to be your soldier, but I am done going to battle for you. Consider this my white flag. So in days like this, when I feel like I have nothing more to write, when I feel like I can't right my wrongs because the day left me into pieces, on days like this when I feel tainted, tired, crumbling and decaying because the salmon was burned or-- or the order wasn't right or my thoughts consumed me and keep me up at night. When I'm up shits creek and the struggle of loneliness, of greed, of fraud and scheme, jealousy, temptation, this and that, it's all rubbish. Tell them how I fought to the end. Tell them that life did not defeat me. These dreams keep catching me. They capture me. So I surrender. As daylight creeps in, I pick up my pen just as the sun rises without my permission and I awake in my dreams and I do good things. I do good things. Even on days like this." Thank you. Welcome back.
