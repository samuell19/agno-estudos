…and his partner Paco Ramirez, world champion in his weight-class, against Mephisto King, a man who scares his own mom, and Cromagnon, the most hated and feared brute of all the rings in the world, who was disqualified several times for cheap shots and atrocious violence. Come one and all, with your kids tonight at 9 p.m. …the most hated and feared of all the rings of the world, who was disqualified several times for cheap shots and atrocious violence… CATCH WRESTLING AT CARPENTRAS RICARD ANISETTE Don't miss this major match which will see L'Ange Blond, the archangel of the ring, who remains undefeated for 117 fights, and his partner Paco Ramirez, world champion in his weight-class, fight against Mephisto King, a man who even scares his own mom and Cromagnon, the brute… Hello. How are you? THE LITTLE CAMPER BOOKSTORE PUISET - Hello, Mr. Loiseau. - Hello. - I need your help, beautiful. - With pleasure. That's nice of you. Could you hang this in the window? It would help my friends. Oh, I don't know. I'd need to ask Miss Jacqueline. It's not a big deal. No, I swear. I need to ask. Give it to me. I'll go show her. As I told you, Mr. Ferréol, an anthology of poems from Provence isn't that simple. So Lattès has refused it too? I know, why don't you try self-publishing? - What's up, kid? - Mr. Loiseau wants us to hang this up. What is it? CATCH WRESTLING TWO FOUR-MAN MATCHES IN ONE NIGHT God, that's ugly! He's completely mad. What do I do? I don't dare say no to him. Give it to me, I'll deal with it. Excuse me, Mr. Ferréol. - Hello Mr. Loiseau. - Hello. I'm very sorry but I can't hang your poster in here. Why? I'd have loved to help but it's not right for this type of establishment. What type of establishment are you? Definitely not Mephisto King. Okay… No, but really, As a fellow store owner I was just asking for a favor, that's all. I understand, Mr. Loiseau but… Imagine if I asked you to hang the latest Modiano or of the latest Normal Mailer amongst your punching balls and boards? Who is Norman Mailer? Let's just say he's not a key figure in rugby. Here's your poster. Goodbye Mr. Loiseau, I have work. Goodbye. Danny, I'm going for lunch. I'll be back around 2 p.m. By the way, what's your sister-in-law like? She's great. She's really great. Very cultured. A great sense of humor. She's got a really great sense of humor. No, I meant physically? That too. But she's very open-minded, she's the kind of girl who's interested in everything. One doesn't get bored with her. Yes, no, I meant, has she got a good figure? What the hell is this one doing… So, does she have a good figure? Yes, good enough. And she's 40 and not married? - What's wrong? - Good God! - What? - The bread. Did we buy bread? - Hello, aunty. - Hello. How are you? What are you playing with? - We're playing with cars. - Oh, that's good. - You didn't know, did you? - No. - It's not a leading story. - Did they charge the police chief? - Yes and his deputy too. - Hello. Hello. Oh, Jacqueline! May I introduce you to Mr. Pierre Janolle. My sister, Jacqueline. There. - Mr. Pierre Janolle was free today and… - Hello. …and Raymond had the great idea of inviting him. An excellent idea. So, shall we eat? I'm a bit hungry. Here, come on. Well, you can… sit here. Yes. Um… No. No, sit here. You'll be better there. Never sit a man opposite me. - There. - There's such a bad draft there… In fact, Raymond can sit there. Valérie, Nicolas, Bruno, lunch is served! I don't give a shit about men. - Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Has there been another one? Another what? A police blunder? She's taking the piss. One of your colleagues ran over an old lady who was crossing the street. Oh, it's a trap… The lady wasn't just crossing anywhere. She was on the crosswalk. These things happen. Shall we talk about something else? As you wish. Help yourself. - Do you like reading, Mr. Janolle? - A great deal. - A great deal… - That much? Eat up, or else it will go cold. Yes, eat, Pierre. Yes, eat. She's crazy, I give up. What exactly are you? Widowed, divorced or can't find a partner? So what? He wouldn't have been invited if he were married. You can't say that to a man whose wife ditched him a month ago. - Now I get guys who've been cheated on. - Jacqueline… I'm telling you, I'm fine as I am! No, it's not true. You're lying. Anyway, Raymond is allowed to invite his colleagues round for lunch. Obviously. In future, tell me beforehand and I'll go have lunch elsewhere. Surely, you don't want to spend the rest of your life like this? Why not? Because… because it isn't healthy. There we have it! Madam has said it. No, there's going to be a speech about ovaries, menopause and all that jazz. - What are ovaries? - That was clever of you. How about we exchange identifying information? Aunty! Hurry up, it's moving! What an earth were you doing? - An idiot drove into me. - We're going to miss the start. No, we've got time. Plus, the beginning is when he falls from a helicopter. Yes, I know. - Are you sure you've got cash? - Of course. - Aunty? - What? Can't you see it's sold out? First of all, don't say, "Can't you see". Second, it's the largest venue in town. Yes, but there are still so many people ahead of us. It's not that many. There's what? There's… Shit, the guy who was cheated on. - Wait a second. - Why? Nothing. Go ahead, sir. - What's up with you, aunty? - Nothing. Go for it, ma'am. - You're crazy, we're going to miss it! - We won't. Go, ma'am. A few people won't make a difference. Go ahead, ladies and gentlemen. We can let two people go ahead. Plus, it's stuffy inside. You're doing it on purpose, aunty. She's absolutely nuts. Come on. Are you happy? We're moving. Look, there's barely anyone. We've sold out, ladies and gentlemen! Sorry, it's sold out. You'll see, this movie is much more interesting. It's your fault that we didn't get in. Two tickets for Tess, please. At this time of day, we're not showing Tess, ma'am. It's not Tess showing? No, it's Cement cock. Oh, great. That must be good. What is Cement cock, please? It's a very good movie. It's hardcore. No thanks. - Why didn't we stay? - It wasn't suitable for you. We can't go see the helicopters, we can't watch Cement cock. With you, we can't see a single thing. I'm fed up. - Here neither? - Probably not. You're an idiot! Sorry. What an earth am I going to do with this kid, at this time of day? Ladies and gentlemen, now for the main match of the evening, the international four-man catch wrestling match, directed and refereed by Guillaume Raquet, former lightweight champion of France. Tonight, he will oversee the L'Ange Blond and his team mate. Here is the gaucho, the handsome, the dark Paco Ramirez! Tonight, they face Mephisto King, who is assisted by Cromagnon! The vile, the fierce, the cruel… the bestial Cromagnon. Let me remind you that this fight… They scare me. Don't they you? They are phony. Miss Puiset? Has your establishment changed? It's all about muscles now! Dear God, he's hairy! It's all an act! Even his hair is an act. No! THE RICARD COMPANY One, two… One… One, two, three, four… Rip his body hair off! Bastard! You bloody gorilla. Did you see what he did? I'm telling you, they're fake blows. Did I hurt you? I think you broke my leg. Yes, come in. - May I? - Take the tray? Yes, over there. Go for it. I'm sorry! You're annoying, Marcello, we've told you to be careful. I mean… It's not my fault. - It's your body hair. - Oh, come on… You don't realize, you're very dangerous. What's going on? I don't want any drama! It's nothing. Marcello struck again, that's all. Wasn't yesterday night enough? Why are you naked? I was washing myself, sir. Do it fully dressed! It's crazy the effect he has on women. You know that I don't want drama! What's going on? Hello, gentlemen. Ma'am. Is there a problem? No, it's nothing. The young girl was surprised, that's all. Thanks ma'am. EMERGENCY SERVICES ENTRANCE EXIT - Excuse me, miss? - Yes, sir? Mrs. Puiset, please. Mrs. Puiset… Check out the nurse. Room… - Room 38. - Thanks. That's enough. - Marcello, come with me. Listen carefully. - What? You'll go see her. - She's in room 38. - Why me? Because you broke her leg, you idiot! - Be diplomatic, okay? - Yes. What will I say to her? I've got stage fright. Come in! She told me to come in. Come in, I said! Oh, she must be expecting someone else. You said: "Come in", so I came in. I was expecting my sister. I broke your leg last night. Oh, it was you? What do you want? I came to find out how your leg is. I'm very embarrassed about it. It's the first time it's happened in ten years of doing this. There was no need for you to come. You have to understand, there's Mr. Simon. The seats weren't five meters away. I'm telling you it doesn't matter. It's a leg I barely use. Are you looking for these? Thanks. What do you want from me? - Yes, I have a squint. Does it bother you? - No, no. Say that it bothers you. Not at all. It doesn't bother me at all. Go away! Go away. I'm sorry. Who was it? - Cromagnon. - He's a handsome guy! So? She's not filing a complaint. Are you sure? Yes. Yes! Why didn't you give her the flowers? You imbecile! CATCH WRESTLING "Did I hurt you?" "You broke my leg, that's all." - God, they are stupid. - That's enough! - What's this circus? - Listen, boss, we were… But… That's enough! Sit down. Come on! I don't want any drama! Understood? You're not going to make a fuss about it, are you? Accidents happen. I hurt her. You broke her leg, she'll get over it. No, that's not it. I broke her leg yesterday, today I hurt her. Ah yes. Yes. Ah yes, yes. Yes. Well… - Yes, it's much better. - Yes? Oh yes. It's much better. Come with me to my office, please. When did I do it? November last year? No, it was December. I think it's healed very, very well. Are you not bothered by the fact that I'm still just as cross-eyed, doctor? Excuse me, miss, but I did not hide the fact that your squint might appear again in certain situations. In my opinion, there are too many situations. Oh, hey… No need to exagerate. It's true that sometimes, with tiredness… or anger. - That's true. - Or emotion. Granted. When I'm hungry, when I'm thirsty, when the sky is overcast. Miss, you can't be saying that there's not a moment when you don't squint? - No, very true. - So, you see! I don't when I'm sleeping, I believe. Unfortunately, no one benefits then. TRAVEL BESTSELLERS THE SELECTION OF THE YEAR - The trainee is cute, isn't she? - She's not bad. I'm going to bag that babe. Tell me, kid, could you dress the window in a way that's less showy? I don't understand, miss. This is a bookstore, not a sexshop! - Let's go, guys? - Yeah. Marcello! Do you recognize me? I'm Sergio! It's Sergio! They used to call me "big-headed Sergio". Yes. I've never met this guy. I say, come closer. We've gone all out on you. So, between fellow countrymen… - You know? - All out how? We bet on you! 600,000 pounds. Hey! So you've got to kill L'Ange Blond. One mustn't bet. Not at catch wrestling. -Not here -Why not? Why? I'm not in good shape. He's not in good shape… As if he's not in good shape! He's a beast! He's not in good shape… Come, let's leave him to get ready. See you later. Hey, guys, don't be idiots, okay. I never win. It's in my contract. What do you mean, you never win? Well no. I'm the bad guy, I can't win. And I can't win with her either. One! What's up, Marcello? You don't understand! A woman of that standing… - Do you think she'd be interested in me? - Two! I don't know. The least you can do is ask her. One! Refund! One! Refund! Shit. Hype me up, I'm struggling here! Boo! This is a joke! What's wrong with him? Is he sick or what? I dunno. He's sluggish! I can't earn a living with neurasthenic wrestlers! Do you understand? Yesterday was enough. Go get him. Go get him! Bite his thigh! Come on! No, no stop! - Stop! - I say, Marcello, we can't go on like this. What's wrong? Sorry, boss. I'm distracted. I can only think of her. Think about the match! I don't give a shit about that woman! Come on, wrestle! I can't do it, boss. I need to see her. CATCH WRESTLING Why don't you take her some flowers? I already brought her some. But you didn't even give them to her! I don't know, how about some chocolates? What happens if she's got a weak liver? I already broke her leg! You're being a pain in the ass. Give her some crutches then. I need something meaningful. I don't know. Something with meaning. I don't know. Is it for a man or a lady? A lady. - Is she married? - No. Are you sure? Yes. I saw it on the insurance document. Single. - Not married, in other words. - Yes. The Goncourt winner always pleases. Do you not have anything bigger? Hello. Do you know where Miss Puiset lives? - Here. - She's a bookstore owner? Well yeah. Ah… Shit. Oh, its Mr. Cromagnon! Don't you recognize me? I'm Jacqueline's sister. Oh yes, hello. Hello. Come with me. - Are you well? - Yes. It's nice to see you. - Were you here to see Jacqueline? - Yes. I came to check in on her. - What a surprise. - Oh really? She'll be pleased. Oh, here she is. But… Look who is here. She's not got a squint. Hello. Hello. I came to apologize. If it's about the leg, it's better. No, not about the leg. About last time. You know… At the hospital. Ah yes, now she's squinting. Oh dear… What are you doing this evening? Well… What name should I put? What? For the inscription. Cromagnon! God, these hairs of mine… Luckily she's got a squint. A bit more here. Is the fiancé of the bookstore owner ready? Don't talk nonsense. The catch wrestler won't be disappointed. What a beautiful girl! Raymond? Take care of your wife's friends, please. Yes, I'm going. Excuse me. Hello. How are you? Are you okay? Take a seat, please. - Bravo! - Thanks. Thanks a million. What are you going to recite now? Do you think that… I don't want to bore anyone. No! You really won't! Is he leaving? Carry on. And now my brother-in-law is ruining my plan. What a pain in the ass, right? I don't understand a thing he's saying. Go for it, help yourselves. I almost fell asleep. I actually think I drifted off. It seems quite pretty, no? Don't we have to go back in there? No, don't worry about it. That's enough. Cheers. Oh, shit. The idiot. - The door! - Sorry. What a crackpot! Do you want a drink? Gladly. Oh, shit! That poet is hard to put up with! So, you're the catch wrestler? Yes. There's something I'd like to know, the wristbands… how do they make so much noise? We can't tell you that. - Oh? - No, no. It's a professional secret. - Oh, are you being serious? - Serious. - Are you proud of yourself, Marie-Claude? - What? Your idea of inviting Cromagnon and his friend. What? They are friendly, aren't they? It's obvious it's not their type of event! Here, take care of this. Provençal poetry is clearly over their heads. To be honest, it's over my head too. Do you realize that without Ferréol the Provençal language would be dead? Oh really? He makes it a living language, does he? They all left. I told you. It doesn't interest anyone. Hey, the phone directory. The phone directory! Who does he think he is? The phone directory! - The phone directory! - Wait. Wait… Entertain us. - No. No. - Yes, yes. Okay, fine. Yeah. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo. Since you've decided to impress us, why don't you show us? What? Your… Jacqueline, stop it. Please. Oh, please Marie-Claude. It's so rare to be able to have a laugh! Come on. Do a good deed. Take your shirt off! The shirt! The shirt! Forget it, Marcello… Yes. You're right. It's stupid. Excuse me. So you really don't want to please me? Right. Okay, let's dance. I said, "Let's dance." We're leaving. Already? We didn't even dance. It's late. I didn't think he'd actually do it. Excuse me, miss? Do you want to dance? Leave me alone! You've ruined my evening enough as it is! You should be proud of yourself. What did you expect inviting him? Oh, don't start again. What? Why do you take it off? Because I'm not a bastard. What does it matter? You're still cheating on your wife. Yes, but it's a matter of principals. Aren't you happy? Didn't you enjoy it? Yes, yes. - A gitane? - No, thanks. Why are you sulking? Are you ashamed? A bit. So? Everyone screws around. Miss Jacqueline doesn't. No kidding… Puiset wouldn't turn down a box with a ring in it. No, she wouldn't. You know, if I were to take an interest in her, the situation would change quickly. And Grangier? - What about Grangier? - He's a widower. You could invite him. He's getting married in a month. Thanks. It shows just how family-oriented you are. You're going to be able to gallop now. I hope so. I'll just do a quick X-ray and then you can leave. Thanks. Cromagnon… Does L'Équipe not report on catch wrestling? Are you ready? Since when do you read L'Équipe? Can I help you, Mr. Ferréol? Is Miss Puiset not here? No, she's in Paris for some serious business with Hachette. Ah… Are you sure I can't help you? No, thank you. L'ETOILE D'OR TOBBACONIST, CAFE Can one make calls here? You need to ask for a token. Fine… I'll have another rum please. Does it hurt there? A bit. You can carry on, you know. Hello? Hello, sir. Could I speak with Mr. Marcello, please? Marcello! Don't overdo it. - Marcello, there's a call for you. - A call? A man or a woman? A woman. Hello? Hello, it's Jacqueline Puiset. - Do you remember me? - Yes. I'm calling because I'm in Paris and I thought that… What? I… Maybe we could talk? About what? Personally, I've got loads of things to tell you. Like what? Well, here it's… it's difficult. Where, then? I'm… I'm in a café. Um, I… I can wait a good hour. Which café? Hello. Hello. Sit down. What would you like to drink? - Mint syrup with water, please. - And rum? Um… No, a cup of tea. When I think that… I don't even know your real name. Marcello Degli Fiori. - Thanks. Are you Italian? - Yes. Did you know you speak perfect French? Oh, come on. - Were you born here? - No, in Italy. I've been here for ten years. And… what did you do in Italy? I was a gymnastics professor. Oh, that's wonderful. Why did you leave? Oh dear, this is off to a bad start. Because the kids called me King Kong. We're off to a bad start. Say something. That's not nice. Do you prefer Cromagnon? Cromagnon is a man, King Kong is a monkey! We're off to a very, very bad start. We can go elsewhere if you'd like… What's it to hide? Yes. - My car is here. - Oh yes, but I've got the van there. Should I take you? No, I can't leave the van there. I could get a fine. So… it's best if I come with you. - Yeah, that would be better. - Okay. - Where are we going? - What? - Where are we going? - Wherever you want! - I don't know, I don't know Paris well! - Pardon? I don't know Paris well! Let me show you. - Your van makes a lot of noise! - What? - Your van makes a lot of noise! - Yes. Why are you in Paris? For business. I wanted to talk to you! What? - Talk to you. - Ah… For that matter, this isn't ideal! Hey. Can we go there? Yes. I'm sorry, but… I'm really not allowed to. Don't worry about it. I'm doing okay, aren't I? No? I don't know what got into me at my sister's the other evening. Let's not talk about it. Well, yes. I'm the first to know to what extent it can hurt. She is nice after all. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Maybe I should row after all. Oh no. It's fine, I'm just starting to have fun. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. If only that would give him an idea. Oh Marcello, go for it. Long live Italy. No, it didn't. In theory, the man should hold the woman's hand in moments like this, no? What if he doesn't dare to? Well, he should dare! Especially if she traveled 800 kilometers to come and see him. That's true, yes. And maybe he could then kiss her. And take her in his arms? At the risk of seeming daring, yes. This dialogue is stupid. Yes, but… to take her in his arms, one would need a puddle… so he can stop her stepping in it. Great, now we need a puddle. There's one. Let's go. Take me to yours. - Are you sure I need to bring it? - Yeah. You can't leave it here. Look. Okay, I'll follow you then. Great! Great! I love you, Jacqueline. I love you. My God! I think I love him. We'll be there in two minutes. Maybe five minutes. It's busy on the roads today. Oh yes, I love him. My sweet, sweet love. Idiot! Shit, shit, shit! Marcello. Where are you? Wait for me. I love you. Oh no! Don't turn on the lights. You're right. Sit down. - There? - Yes. Would you like something to drink? Oh yes. A small glass of rum. Actually, I'd like a bit more light. You're right. Oh, not that much. - May I? - Yes, of course. Hey! It's burning. That's great. What are you doing? I'm getting undressed. - Shit! - No. Forget it. No, it could be important. Hello? Yes. Hello, Mr. Simon. Yes, yes. My shoulder? Yes, it's better thanks. Oh, this is difficult! Who? Me? It's difficult. Now? Fine, fine… Okay, okay. I'm sorry, my love. What? I need to stand in for someone. Oh no, but… What will I do? You… Come with me. It's not far! It's at Courneuve. Yes, of course! So I catch you and I crucify you in the ropes. At that moment, I'm on the floor. I get up, a kick in the face. It a punishing act until the end. Marcello is KO. I'll then free you so you can defeat him. No problem, guys. Don't be an idiot, okay? Guillaume does it very well. - Okay, okay. - Let's go. Be sure to act like you're suffering in the ropes, okay? - So it doesn't seem fake. - No fear! - Be careful with my shoulder. - Yes. Yeah! Your balls stink! Piece of trash! Bastard! Bastard! …Cromagnon! No, it's not possible. Jacqueline, I can feel you watching. I can't lose. Not in front of you, my love. Enough! Watch me. The mean guy is going to win for you! Watch Jacqueline. I'm doing this for you! I'm doing it for you, Jacqueline! I'm the strongest! I'm going to win! Shit, what are you doing? Oh, referee! You're made! Oh, my God! It's a slaughter house! Bastard! Stop. People are furious, stop! Piece of trash! Piece of trash! Can't you see there's a riot? Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Jacqueline. Jacqueline! I did this for you! Jacqueline… I love you. Hello. I'm sorry. Can I see him? Come in. Hello. How are you? How do you feel? What got into you last night? You know that I don't want drama. Look, Albert. This is for you. You're making fun of him, to boot! You broke his jaw and now offering him chocolates! Why not nougat? I didn't think about that. The one time I get you to be a replacement, it was hardly a success. Now, the arena needs replacing. Marcello, can you tell us what was going on in your head? If you don't mind me asking. Do you get it? In front of her! Are you mad at me, Albert? Next time, if she comes to see you, let me know beforehand, okay? So it's that bad, is it? - Is she the first? - There was one before her. - When I was 15 years old, in Italy. - And? I wanted to kiss her, but she ran away screaming. That night she had concussion. We had to leave the neighborhood. That's a tough start. - You think it's funny, do you? - Sorry. What are you going to do now? I don't know. Why don't you go see her? - Hey, did you notice? - What? She looked at you. Don't talk nonsense. I swear she turned to look at you. Me? You're an idiot. I swear, if I was a woman, I could fall in love with you. - Who? You? - Yes! You don't hit the referee! That's a warning. This is my stop. See you. Hey, Marcello. Don't forget, okay? Anyone can like anyone, there are no rules. HACHETTE DICTIONNARY Who are we making fun of here? No one, miss. Fifty Laurence Pernoud! Does that seem normal? Many women find it interesting. That's your opinion. But miss… You'd be better off putting the school books away! Don't forget that this is also a bookstore for educational purposes. Do you really think they study contraception at school? I leave for 48 hours and it's… chaos in here! THE LITTLE CAMPER I bet a bottle of Ricard on the Puiset woman. No. A crate, okay? I bet a crate of Ricard. I'll tell you the time and place… and you come and check, guys. - Are you playing at mission impossible? - Laugh as much as you want. A crate. Ma'am, do you have an encyclopaedia please? Over there, at the back. - Do you sell protractors, please? - This isn't a stationery store. Ask your mom for 25 francs! Do you have Geometry by Bordas? Yes. What's the lazy bones doing? Where is Geometry by Bordas? Everyone needs to wait their turn and calm down! Wow, there's quite the atmosphere in here. I'm ready. - What do you mean "I'm ready"? - I've decided to read. What do you advise… advisor? - Can I take it? Mom will drop by tomorrow. - Of course. Now go! No, I'm not joking, I want to try it. - But I can see you don't have time now. - No. That's why I thought that we could meet one evening, because I know a quiet, little inn. My mom will pay for this tomorrow. You can leave! You too and get a move on! Who do you take me for? Everyone out, please! Sir, please leave. And you too, ma'am! What did I just say? What are you still doing in the store? Come on! - And what's she up to? - Me, miss? Leave me alone, I need to do the inventory! But we did it a month ago! Mind your business, get out! And the mummy who is glued to her seat? Does she need me to help her move? Leave! THE PLEASURES OF SEEING Jacqueline! Open up, it's Marie-Claude. What's wrong? Are you ill? What happened this morning? Nothing. Mr. Loiseau came in to buy a book, that's all. What's going on? I don't know. Apparently, my sister is doing the inventory. Oh I say… One day she's gone to see Hachette, the next day she's doing the inventory… How long will it take? I can maybe help you? Um, no… You can't. We need to do something! What do we do about school books? Still there. PUISET BOOKSTORE Is anyone there? Jacqueline? It's me, Marcello. I need to speak to you. It's important! Jacqueline? I know you're there. Jacqueline! Go away. Jacqueline! Listen… Since the fight the other night, I've only been able to think about you. I'm telling you to leave me alone! Are you here to see the bookstore owner? Yes. - You're wasting your time. - Why? She's a bit strange, you know. And she's having a crisis right now. - It's cost me a crate of Ricard. - How so? Well yeah. She's sex-starved. It's eating away at her. He's dangerous. That's not normal. She needs to eat something, she's got an empty stomach. What if she won't open up? - I'll put it through the mailbox. - There isn't one. That's true. I'll slip it under the door then. Do you think a sandwich… What are you doing here, Mr. Cromagnon? No, okay, I… I'll explain. He says Jacqueline will open up for him. Go for it! - And the cops? - Oh nothing. Words were had with Loiseau… It's nothing important. I don't understand what's going on. Jacqueline? Please open up. Remember Paris, Jacqueline. Are they on first name terms? I don't know. As if I understand what's going on. Do you remember the fridge? I didn't know what I was doing! We were good together. Together? We kissed. Shut up! You're a brute! I don't want to hear your voice anymore! Europe One, it's natural. The town of Bièvres, in the Essonne, has not received mail for three days. The staff of the post office in this town of 6000 inhabitants have started a strike so that management puts enhanced security measures in place. A week ago, the post office was attacked by three gangsters, who forced the postmaster to open the safe - and stole… - You kissed her? …after hitting the postmaster. The post office staff are afraid and have been on strike for three days. This news was been communicated to us… One, two, three. …Three, five, six, seven, eight. Jacqueline, it's me Marcello. I'm talking in the microphone so you can still hear me. Jacqueline… I love you. Pinch me, Raymond. I love you! And I know you love me too. It's not true. It's not true! Jacqueline, I'm going to ask you to be my wife. Never. I'm not going to become the wife of a hairy catch wrestler, am I? I know that I'm not ideal husband material for a bookstore owner but even though Mr. Simon might not agree to it, I'll make a promise in front of everyone! Jacqueline, I'll give up catch wrestling, if that's what you want. I have a squint! Did she need to say that? Yes, I have a squint. Jacqueline, please! Listen! It's not easy for people like us. Stop acting like an idiot, aunty! Jacqueline! Now, I'm going to come to your door. I'll count to three and you'll open up. I'm counting on you, Jacqueline! One! Two! Three! Get out of here! Can't you see it's a private conversation? That's true. Step back! Come on, move! Dear God, these are family matters! Move back! Jacqueline… Please open the door now. Open the door! Shit. Come on, go home. Be nice. There's nothing more to see. Oh! Jacqueline! It can't be true. This can't be true! It wasn't me! The shutters are stuck. Oh shit! Madre mia, madre mia Jacqueline. Open the small door, my love. Damn. I can't. It's stuck too! Ow! You dunk? Always, my love. That's a good start. Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
