Watch them Barbwire, they'll break for those hills. All right, Drake. Hey, Barbwire! Take a look at that water. It's getting less and less. I've never known Rangle River to ever let us down like this before. I think I'll take a run over to the homestead and have a talk with the boss. You better come along too. Come on! Whoo-ey! Thank you, Lonely, go around to the kitchen and get a cup of tea. Thank you, miss. Come on here. Get up. What have you got there, Minna. A letter, sir. It's from London. Oh, oh say, run and tell Lonely to wait. There will be an answer for this. Yes, sir. More tea, Mr. Lawton? No thank you, Minna. What was it? A letter from London. Oh. There's Black. That means Lawton's here. Come on! Cut it out. Cut it out. Cut it out. Well, if it isn't my old friend, Black. Hello, Barbwire. - Hello Black. Oh, you're busy. Yes, I've just had a letter from Marion, she needs more money. I've got to get a check off to her at once. Ah, I see. I say Dan, by the way, if you decide to sell that young bull I want, let me know, will you. I'll see you in a day or so. Yes, certainly. - Fine, cheerio. See you. Hiya, Drake. - So long, Lawton. Lawton pestering you again about buying that prize bull. Yes, Dick, he was. Well, why don't you tell him once and for all that he can't have it, Dan. You know that he's a competitor for our meat contract. He's simply trying to improve his own stock. That contract's worth thousands to us. And the only reason we landed it is because our cattle were better than his. You don't like Lawton, do you? Not particularly, no. Just remember, he's one of our neighbors. You must admit that he's been a good friend to me when I needed one. You believe in everybody, don't you, Dan. Just had a letter from Marion. So this check tells me. Look here, Dan, there's something that's got to be said. And don't blame me if you don't like it. What's the trouble? Three things, Rangle River, Marion and you. I don't understand you, Dick. Well then perhaps I'd better explain it to you so you will understand. First of all, Rangle River's failing us. You know that. And if it dries up the cattle will lose condition and that means we'll lose the meat contract. We need a well, Dan, need it desperately. And yet you say we can't afford to bore for water. Why? I'll tell you why. Because of the money that Marion spends on gowns and jewels and expensive parties and flying trips all over Europe, that's why. You've completely spoiled her, Dan. That's pretty straight talk, Dick. I always try and talk straight. The plain truth of the matter is it's about time that Marion quit spending money and came home and made herself useful. She's been a great expense to you, Dan. An expense you couldn't afford. Perhaps I can't quite afford it, Dick. But I want Marion to have all the things she's been having. I want her to be happy and to get the best out of life. And how can she do that if I don't send the money. How will you be able to send the money when you're broke. That's what will happen, Dan, if we don't get water. Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. Rangle River hasn't failed us as yet. And if it does well we can raise money, sink a bore somehow. How? Well we can, well I'll leave it to you to look after the water and I'll look after Marion. There's a girl that's just got to have things. What's a few hundred pounds anyway? Hey Dick, hey? Here, give this to Lonely will ya, Dick. See you later. Have you got the plane tickets already? No, not yet. And how much is the fare to India? Single? - Oh of course, yes. He means he's single, but he wants to return. Oh that's right, yes. - Strangely. Oh I do wish he'd hurry, our plane leaves in three minutes. Name, sir. Mannister, Flight Lieutenant. Initials? - R-M-Sinjun-C. R-N-Sinjun-C. Reginald Morton Sinjun Cough. Oh, call me Reginald or I'll miss the bus. It's all right, sir, that's only the Australian plane warming up. Australia, that's an extraordinary thing. Fancy anyone going to Australia. Oh nice fellas those Australians, sir. Met some of them them in the war. Showed me how to play poker. Oh, that's all very well. But I mean anybody in their right senses... Have you got all the luggage ready then. Yes sir, I've got it all mapped out. Excuse me, if you don't mind. Not at all, frightfully sorry. Could you fix these transfers please. Oh yes, you're the two ladies for Australia, transferring at Darwin. I'd hate the pilot to go without us. Has he seen you yet? Oh yes, we've come from London. Oh, I don't think he'd go without you. He think he'd rather miss mails. Thank you for that assurance, young man. Oh, not at all. And you're delighted? Absolutely. And it's a pleasure? Oh, quite. I thought so. Come along, Marion. Thank you very much. - Don't mention it. Good bye. - Good bye. Have a nice trip. quickly, give me ticket to Australia. But you said India. - My dear chap, I distinctly said Australia, didn't I, Green? Distinctly, sir. - Yes. Pardon me, sir. But do you think you're in your right senses, sir? Green. - Sorry, sir. Now listen, tell that pilot to warm up the engines a bit longer, will you. Right sir. Tell 'em I like 'em nice and hot. Yes, sir. - How much is that fare? 36 pounds. - 36 pounds, right. Now hurry up, Green. - Got it. Otherwise I might miss her. - Go, sir. Right. Hello sir! Oh sir! The black seven on the red eight. Thank you. - Quite right. Jack of hearts on the queen of clubs. You're playing awfully carelessly, aren't you? You know, didn't you happen to be with us all the way, young man, you'd have been a great help to me. Thank you. By the way, I thought I heard you booking for India? India? Oh no, no, I'm going to Australia. I have some friends there you know. And where in Australia? Where, oh where? A place near Coombs. - Coombs? Yes, yes, I'm going to do some prospecting there. Might be quite interesting, don't you think? Very. And what are you prospecting for? The nine of diamonds on the 10 of clubs. Oh, I say, this is rotten luck. The only friends I have in the country are on their way to Columbo. How unfortunate, Mr. Mannister. What will you do now? What, well I don't know what I shall do, really. I mean, here I am in Australia, I'd like to see a bit of the country of course. But I suppose I shall have to toddle back to Singapore and give up all my ideas of prospecting. You know, we have some really lovely prospecting near our place at Rangle River. Really? - Yes. And if you'd like to come along as our guest for a week or two, I'm sure my father would be delighted. Don't you think so, Abby? Well, I think... - Well thank you very much indeed, Miss Hastings, that's awful nice of you. Yes, I'd love to come. I can do my prospecting all over the place. That's frightfully nice of you. Quiet, quiet. Can't you read what's written there? I'm telling you for the last time, these are Rangle River trucks and you can't use them for your cattle. I say they're Lawton's trucks and I'm going to use 'em. Well try it, Black. - All right. Ah, fisticuffs display. Outpost of the empire. Splendid. Come on, let's fill the ringside seats. I think he's in very big trouble. Black! Come on, let's see what you got. Oh, look at that! Hey come on man, that's right. That's it. Go on, Dick, come on. Hey! Go on Dick! Come on Black. Come on. - Come on. Naughty, naughty. Who is that man? That's Drake from Rangle River, miss. How 'bout it Barbwire? Let's load our trucks. Hey, I knew he was gettin' hot. Hurry it up, Barbwire. Are you Richard Drake? Isn't much left of me. You're the rough and ready great outdoor type, aren't you. Beg your pardon? And you rather fancy yourself as being a two-fisted man's man, don't you. Well, I... Well I want to tell you, Mr. Drake, that you impress a casual observer like myself as being something of a bully. What, I... And do you usually talk to ladies with your hat on. Oh, I beg your pardon. And just who is the lady I'm talking to? I'm Marion Hastings. - Oh, I see. And about that letter you sent me calling me a useless... I haven't time to talk about that now, I sent it, you got it. The letter explained everything I think. Excuse me. Yes, you are bad mannered, Mr. Drake. And incidentally, I want to tell you, I didn't enjoy that brutal exhibition. I don't suppose you did. They don't teach that sort of thing in the smart finishing schools in England, do they. No, but they do teach good manners. Well Miss Hastings, your good manners will be a great deal of help to our thirsty cattle at Rangle River. In fact, your valuable experience on the continent will undoubtedly solve our entire problem. Now just what do you suggest we do first? I suggest you acquire some intelligence and stop treating men like cattle. Now wait a minute, Miss Hastings. In the first place, you've only just arrived here and so you don't know whether we use our intelligence or not. In the second place there are some men who deserve being treated like cattle. And in the third place, since you've been abroad for 15 years wasting your father's money and generally making yourself useless, you shouldn't voice an opinion. Because you can't have any conception of what we're up against here. Well, Mr. Drake, suppose you tell me in your charming and courteous manner just what you are up against. You, among other things. I say, what a fight. Drake, what a fighter probably, probably a descendant of Sir Francis Drake, hm, great chap. Our opinions differ, Mr. Mannister. Huh, oh, I suppose they do. Stay for dinner tonight, Donald. I've been a bit worried, I'd like to have a talk with you. About the river drying up you mean. Yes, how are you off for water? Oh, I have enough. There's a car coming. Could you tell where... Daddy, Daddy! - Marion! Darling. - Marion, my little girl. I'm so glad to be back. I say, Mrs. Abbot. - Sh. Let me have a look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Not after 15 years? No, I knew you the moment I saw you. Well then, Hastings, haven't you got a word of welcome for your sister. Abby my dear, welcome home. Lawton, my sister. How do you do. - Charmed, I'm sure. And daughter. - How do you do. Well this is an unexpected pleasure. Just a moment, Daddy. Daddy, I want you to meet. Oh, this is Flight Lieutenant Mannister of the RAF, I believe. - Absolutely. How do you do, sir. - How do you do. As he's visiting Australia on leave, I took the liberty of asking him to come and stay with us for a few weeks. Yes, it was very kind of your daughter. I appreciate it very much indeed. You're very welcome, Mr. Mannister. Thanks, I think I shall have a great time here. Do you know this place has got quite a grip on me already. Yeah, I hope you enjoy your stay with us. Thank you, sir. Come along inside, all of you. Oh, the luggage. I say, what about giving a hand with the luggage. Oh sure. My dear, it's just as if a little bit of heaven has come right into this home, just now. Is it, Dad. - Oh, I missed you terribly. But just seeing you makes me satisfied with all the lonely years. They'll never be lonely for you again, Daddy. But what brought you home so unexpectedly, dear. I missed you too. Besides, I received a letter from a man named Drake. Delightful dinner, Dan, just like old times. And there's your old chair waiting for you, Abby. Oh how charming. Are you happy? - Very happy, Dad. Hm. May I? - I say old boy, how do you make the damper stuff you were talking about? Quite indigestible I'd say. Well damper's the Australian bushman's bread. It's quite simply made, the dough's merely dumped in the hot ashes of a fire. Oh actually, it's most delicious. Sounds awful dull though. Oh, shall I get rid of that for you? Who's that singing?

Nice looking isn't she? I didn't notice particularly. Maybe it'll start something when you do. Yeah, maybe you'll stop something in a minute. She ought to give you an interest in life. Rangle River drying up gives me enough interest without worrying about a girl like that. Like what? - Like, uh, aw, let's not discuss it. Who was that man with her this afternoon?

I beg your pardon, so sorry. He says to the caller hang on and he skips away you see, gets his spectacles, come back, takes up the phone, puts on his spectacles and says to the caller, now.

And this old house certainly looks as if it could do with one. Everyone here has been working while I've been playing. There's trouble here and daddy has great worries. I'm going to work. Trouble you say. You're right Marion, there's something... Something ugly. I feel it somehow. Huh, Mr. Drake says I'm useless. Does he? - Yes. And he didn't mince matters telling me either. I think he's hateful, just a fighting brute. I think he's quite interesting, dark hair, quite interesting, I thought. Well I don't. Why didn't he send for me before. Why didn't he tell me that daddy was so ill. Why don't you ask him? Ask him? I'd rather die first. Useless am I? Now come along, get into bed. You can't do anything useful tonight anyway. Useless, am I? Goodnight, dear. - Good night, Abby. Useless, am I? So I've got bad manners, huh? What's that? - What? Oh, oh nothing, nothing at all. Hello there, removing the grime of battle? Yeah, just getting some of the slime off my hands. Drake, I believe. - Yes. My name's Reginald Morton Sinjun Carfew Mannister. What? But my friends all call me, Reggie. Reggie. - Yes. Well Reggie, I want to thank you for saving me from that knock on the head today. It was very nice of you. Not at all. Dash good fight. - Thanks. But not the sort of thing they teach in those smart finishing schools in England. Oh, quite right, quite right. Something they rather lack, don't you think. Hello, I say, what have you got there? Let me give you a hand, all right. Thanks. How on earth did you get these? Well, lack of good manners and intelligence I suppose. Oh, not a bit of it. That fist is worth it's weight in intelligence. Well, apparently that's a matter of opinion. Quite right, quite right. Here we are, how's that? Fine. You have rather a professional touch. Thanks. - Oh, don't mention it. Well, um. Well, I was... - I was... Already said that. Well, good night. Good night. I told you back... - Very good indeed. I must remember that. And no ugly orders. Queer sort of girl, that. Minna? - Hm. She's all right. Have you had her long? No, not long. She belongs to a no-good family living back in the hills on the border of Lawton's place. Lawton's place? - Yes. He suggested that I take her on account of her father. A beastly fellow. - Oh. Good morning, Dad. - Oh good morning, Abby. Good morning, Marion. - Good morning. How are you? - Very well thank you. And good morning. - Yes, here we are. Thank you, Mr. Mannister. - And allow me to help you. - Thank you very much. Erm, there. - That help? Yeah. - Right. And where's our fighting overseer this morning? Still asleep? - Asleep? Not Dick, he's been on the job since dawn. Good heavens, you don't mean to tell me, he gets up while it's still dark. Yes, we've had to work pretty hard since the river started to dry up, draining bog holes, fencing in the most dangerous ones, moving cattle and so on. I generally go with him, but I've decided this morning to be social and join in a special breakfast party. There will be no more social breakfasts as far as I'm concerned, Dad. I don't want the station routine upset for me. I haven't been much use in the past, but it doesn't say I can't help in the future. Absolutely. - What? Well, I mean, jolly good, jolly sporting of Miss Hastings. You know, the local girl makes good. Makes good what? - Huh? Well, I don't know, she just makes good, that's all. Oh, well that's what I'm asking you, Mr. Mannister. What does she make good? Well, I, I, you see she pulls her weight with the team and rows a hefty oar. Yes, sticks by the skipper, good type you know. Very lucid, Mr. Mannister, I understand perfectly. Yes, I thought you'd get the idea in time. Where are the boys this morning? They're bringing in stock from number three paddock to the yard for drafting and branding. Oh, is Mr. Drake with them? Yes, he will be there. Oh dear, old Dick, he's a great chap. Don't you think so Miss Hastings. I'm afraid I haven't bothered about him, Mr. Mannister. Hey Drake, come here! Hold his head, Joel. There, you look. Come on! Come on, she may have broken her neck! No, it wasn't her neck. Who gave you permission to use this horse, Miss Hastings? Do I have to get permission to use what belongs to me? If you don't know how to handle it sanely, yes. You should know better than to put a stock horse to a fence like that. Now we don't expect you to be of any help around here. So the very least you can do is keep out of trouble. This is your father's favorite horse and you hurt it pretty badly. Don't bother to inquire whether I'm hurt. I quite realize the horse is far more important. He's far more useful. Come on, Barbwire, we'll take his over to the yard, fix that cut and strap it. Miss Hastings. Oh, it's you. I'm sorry I was so abrupt. I hope you weren't hurt by your fall. Does it matter seeing that I'm so useless? Perhaps I shouldn't have said that. You see, we're not used to women around here and that probably accounts for my bad manners. How 'bout we let that go for the moment. What's more important right now is that we've got a tough job before us. We've all got to pull together if we're gonna to accomplish anything. Now don't you think that under the circumstances, in order to get things done we might stop hating one another? I'm not sufficiently interested in you, Mr. Drake, to hate you. Well that goes double, Miss Hastings. We both seem to bristle whenever we meet. That doesn't help matters much, does it? Does it? Why, of course it doesn't. Look here, Miss Hastings. Maybe if you could show me that you could keep out of mischief, I could show you that I have some good manners and intelligence. You certainly look better when you smile, Mr. Drake. Funny thing, I was thinking the same thing about you. Well, I. What's that man doing over there? That's a water diviner. Your father's decided to sink a bore now that the river's drying up. ♪ A little divining rod ♪ ♪ Bend the way that you oughter ♪ ♪ Show me where, far under the sod ♪ ♪ There is beautiful water ♪ ♪ North, south, east or west ♪ ♪ Little divining rod do your best ♪ ♪ Tip your end to it ♪ ♪ Lead a friend to it ♪ ♪ Beautiful, bountiful water ♪ You can use my horse, Miss Hastings. But remember, no more fences. You promise. - Promise. Give me your leg. Wait a minute, I'll get you out. Poor little cow. Don't be silly, come on. Oh dear. Lord, what sort of a mess has she got into now. Mr. Drake, Mr. Drake! Mr. Drake, Mr. Drake! A nice fix we're in. You can't get out and I can't get out. Well, old Mudpie Hastings. Oh, now you've got me doing it. What on earth are you up to now. I'm trying to get this wretched little calf out. Can't you keep out of trouble. Well I only want to be helpful. Well if you don't stop being so helpful, I'll have to detail a man to look after you. Come on. You've even got mud on your nose. What about the calf? You're more important than the calf. Oh. - To your father anyway. Oh! Come on. All right, Useless, over the fence. Get on the horse. I will not. Miss Hastings, you're under my orders and you'll take 'em and like 'em. Get on the horse. Wait a minute. Not on my clean saddle. I hope you can bring her in soon, Jim, the river's completely dry. Have you any idea how much longer it will take. I don't know, Dick, it's entirely problematic. She might blow any minute or she might take six months. Well we can't wait on uncertainties like that. I'll go over and have a talk with Dan about moving the cattle. Rush her as fast as you can. And if she does come in, for heaven's sake blow that siren of yours. She'll be screamin' for you. What are we going to do, Dick. Well I'd say our only chance would be to drive them to that water hole in the northern paddock. Have they the strength to make it? I hope so. But the worst part of it is that even if we get them there, there's only enough water to last for a week or so. Yes, and after that? Well after that I don't know, Dan. We've got to start driving them... She blows! She blows! She blows! She blows! - She blows! Come on, Dan! - Come on, call ahead! Whoopie, whoopie! Oh, Mr. Mannister, please. Hey, come on, come on. Hey! There we are. Oh. Oh my goodness. My, my goodness, this is wonderful! Oh wonderful isn't it, it's marvelous. Yay! - Plenty of water now. Yes, all right. Now you can come home. Give me a kiss. Isn't it wonderful! - Isn't it marvelous! Look at that water spouting off. I wonder where it comes from? According to diviner, I should think it comes from. Oh absolutely, of course. You can't do that, you can't do that. It's not good, it's too hard to can't do it. Yes, it looks as though I have to go to Brisbane. This letter from the meat company's complained of the quality of our last shipment. They say they may have to reconsider our contract if our beef doesn't improve. But Daddy, our meat is going to improve. If the bore keeps flowing as it has in the last week, you'll have more water than you can use pouring into the cattle troughs. You haven't anything in the world to worry about. I say, Dick... What nice storm coming up. Yes, but... Oh, storm. Everybody's in the house. What about Drake. Yes, he's there too. You get back inside, Minna, quick! All right boys, we leave the horses here. Cigarette? - No, thank you. Miss Hastings, I think I owe you an apology. I once said you were purely ornamental. Well, I was mistaken. You're a very useful person. I hope you'll forgive me. Perhaps I owe you an apology. I questioned your good manners. I hope you'll forgive me. Granted. So saying the duelists sheath their swords, eh. Now, really Miss Hastings, I don't blame you. It was difficult spot for a girl like you to be put into. Like me, sir? You forget, I'm an Australian cattleman's daughter. Well Australian cattleman's daughter, let's go in. It is dashed difficult thing to shoot, I say, you know. You know, a jolly old kangaroo bobbing up and down all the time. Yes, always doing good. I fear for the king to have a go at them, I really do. Terribly excited. Just like the time I shot my first tiger. I don't think I told you about that, did I, Mrs. Abbot? You certainly did, Mr. Mannister. And about the elephant and about the lion and the polar bear. Dash it all, did I say polar bear? You did, Mr. Mannister. That's right, of course I did, didn't I. Come on, let's get this job over with. Just wait til I send the dynamite down to the bottom. Steady you fool! I have a feeling this party needs brightening up. Right. Where you can lob static this storm. You know, I was just thinking. Dash queer thing Rangle River drying up just after you got that contract. Really, in all the years I've been here, our river's never failed us until now. I've never seen it so dry before. And your neighbor Lawton, I suppose he was short of water too. He says he has enough. He supplies camps from the northern hills. Charming fellow, Lawton. Absolutely. ♪ We don't care how ♪ Well, that's that. Let's go. She's primed to let loose in one minute. ♪ Went outside ♪ Not thank you, Minna. Oh, I'll have some more coffee though, thank you. That's too bad. Get a cloth, quickly. More thunder? Let's hope we get some rain out of this. I don't believe we will. That's jolly strange. What is, Reggie. There was no static before that last thunderclap. That wires been crackling every time the lightning flashed. I didn't notice it. - Huh? No, no, naturally, of course not. You naughty old thing, you. I know. Hello, there's some trouble down there at the catch basin. I'll say there is. Wait a minute. There's your trouble. Looks like our gusher's given up the ghost. Well I hate the job of telling Dan about this. It's going to be tough all around. Run over to the stockyard and tell the boys to saddle up. We're gonna move the cattle at once. I simply can't understand it. Daddy. Hello everybody. Why, what's the matter, anything wrong? Oh, I see, your bore has petered out. Hey, that's tough luck, Dan. I told you it was a bit of a gamble boring for water here you know. I'm afraid you've lost, Dan. I don't believe he has, Mr. Lawton. There's no doubt Lawton's right. The engineer himself said we were only on the edge of the artisan water belt. Well, there's the end of my contract with the meat company. What are we going to do? Why, you can always drive your cattle across to my paddocks for water. Thanks, Donald, but my stock would be worn to the bone driven that distance there and back every day. Dick, I'm afraid we'll have to make the long drive up to the top waterhole. The boys are moving them now, Dan. I'll go along too, they'll need all the help they can get. I'll come along and see if I can help. Come on, Daddy, I must change. I'll be going along too. Oh, by the way, I thought perhaps you and I might get together sometime. You know, I've got a feeling that things aren't quite what they seem around around here. Do you feel that? I thought we might sort of rally around the old flag. Cheerio. Sad? - A little. Poor Dad. Yes, he's the one that I'm worried about. As far as we're concerned, we can face such things without being beaten. We? - Yes, we. You're fast becoming a tough little cattle hand Marion. Oh, well it's good to hear you say that, anyway. Anyway? What do you mean? Nothing. Shall we go on? Reggie, make yourself useful. Cut 'em out on the left flank. Oh dear. Move them over to that plain. Is that the last waterhole. I'm afraid it is, Miss Hastings. We'll camp here for the night. So you better stretch out under those trees and have a spot of rest. What about you, Reggie? - Me? Oh my dear chap, I'm as fit as a fiddle. Oh no. However, I might indulge in a little... Hello, there's some strays along Lawton's boundary line. I'll head them off. Come on. Hello, hey there. Hey, go! Hey! Hey! I say, this is Lawton's. Did you say this is our friend Lawton's boundary. Why yes, Reggie. That fence along there divides the Hastings and Lawton properties. You can see how it cuts across the dried up bed of Rangle River below us. Hm. Lawton's land extends some distance back into those mountains. Rather rough and rugged I'd say. Even tough on a mountain goat. Lawton's land, oh that's very interesting. Very interesting indeed. Yes, it's bad country. Broken by canyons and gullies. Well, should be join the others? Reggie? - Hm. Shall we join, uh? Oh yes, rather. I say, how about a sort of prospecting trip up the river bed? Might be quite interesting. Don't you think? Across Lawton's property? Yes. I'm afraid that's quite impossible. I tried it myself when the river first started to drop, but I was blocked, not only by the bush and undergrowth, but also by some very steep cliffs. Now it's very dangerous up there to both man and beast... Dick! Dick! We saw it all from the river bed. Don't tell me they've killed him. No, breathing but quite unconscious. It's his head, he may die. Oh, what can we do. Home, a doctor's the only thing... Home, yes, we must get him home. Don't worry, Miss Hastings, a faster team can make it. Hey Steve, the wagon up here, quick. Right! Black's work, I'll bet a guinea. Hey Puddin', would you take a look up in those hills for that dingo. He won't die. He won't die, will he? Don't worry, Miss Hastings. There's a lot of life in him yet. I'm very sorry, Mr. Hastings, but in the opinion of the board, you failed to fulfill your contract and we feel that we're justified in contracting with Mr. Lawton. I understand your situation, Mr. Bryant. But I'm sure that if you give me a little time, the quality of Rangle River stock will be up to its old standard. But we've been very lenient with you in the matter of time. Hello? Yes. Mr. Hastings, yes, he's right here. I'll ask him to speak with you. Long distance call for you, Mr. Hastings. Hello. Why yes, Marion, I took last night's train from Brisbane and arrived this morning. What's that? Drake, shot! That's terrible. Oh, he's all right, thank heaven for that. Yes, I'll come home at once. Hello, George. Well, Dick's all right, thank goodness. You know, George, I think Miss Hastings's rather keen about old Dick, what do you think? Oh, I see. You refuse to discuss the matter, do you, hm. I suppose by rights I should be packing up. But you know, I'd give anything to have just one little look at old Lawton's land. If only I had some way of... Wings. Oh, that's all right, old man, I think that's my long distance call, thank you so very much. Hello, hello, hello, is that Jack Sphinx of Aircraft Limited? This is, this Flight Lieutenant Mannister here. RAF, Singapore base. Hello, I want to ask you a favor. I say, do you mind being quiet, please. Awful sorry. No, not you old man, I was speaking to some friends here. I wondered if you could send a plane up here. A plane to Coombs, Coombs, that's right, yeah. No, not tombs, no, no, Coombs, no this is a village not a cemetery. Would that be all right? Look, would this? No, no, sorry. I want to take a little ride. It will, oh splendid. Well, thank you very much. I want to have it up here tomorrow. Yes, oh that's fine. That's very, very good of you. Thank you so much, yes. Oh you little pet. What? Oh no, no, old man, I was just chatting away here, it's quite all right. Cheerio, cheerio, thank you very much. What is it? The best nurses never tell. Oh then I guess I'll look. Don't you dare get out of this bed. You're far too ill. That's absurd. There's nothing the matter with me. The bullet barely scratched my thick skull. Mr. Fighting Man, you're under my orders. But Miss Hastings if I have to... And you'll take 'em and like 'em as you once said to me. Thank you, Minna. And now Mr. Richard Drake, Aunt Abby will be in in a moment to look after you while I have my dinner. I'm starving myself. But Miss Hastings... My friends call me Marion. I appreciate that. By the way, I wasn't christened Mr. Drake. And I appreciate that. Oh hello Mrs. Abbot. Hello, how's the patient? Look after him, will you Abby? I'll be back in a minute and don't let him move. Mrs. Abbot, would you think I have very bad manners if I asked you to get me my trousers? No. Then, will you get me my trousers? No. - Oh. Then I'm coming out of bed. Don't you dare. Marion will be terribly upset if you do that. She's very anxious about you. She is? - Yes. Very anxious? - Very. Oh. Well, in that case,. Good evening. This is a pleasant surprise. I'm terribly sorry to interrupt your dinner, as matter of fact, I came to inquire about your man, Drake. Oh he's quite well. Nothing dangerous. Won't you join me? You're very welcome. That's awfully nice of you. I'm literally starving. Minna? Mr. Lawton's having dinner with me. Yes, Miss. Miss Hastings, there's something that's been bothering me a great deal. Now somebody seems to have started a silly rumor to the effect that my man, Black had something to do with what happened to your overseer. Now please believe me that any such rumor is ridiculous. Why I wouldn't have a man in my employ if he was a killer. I'm positive that Black's nothing of the sort and I am certain that he had nothing whatever to do with it. I hope you don't mind having your coffee in here, Mr. Lawton? Not in the least as long as you're here with the coffee, Marion. You know, this is the first time I've really had an opportunity of being alone with you. Aren't you being just a little... Oh no, I don't really believe I am. Do you think so? - Well... You know, funny thing, the first time I met you, you remember that day you arrived, well I well I was terribly pleased. Really? - Mm, you looked so cute and smart and attractive and well, shall we say sophisticated. You know, we don't get very much of your type of girl in this part of the world now do we? Well, I suggest that you travel, Mr. Lawton. Oh, I say. You know, that's another funny thing, talking about traveling, I was about to suggest that we might take a trip together. What? - Over to my place. You know, I think you'd like it. It's so very up-to-date and modern. All the sort of thing that you're accustomed to. I'm afraid I couldn't. I have far too much to do around here. Besides, Mr. Drake's ill and I must look after him. Oh, I wouldn't bother too much about Drake, Marion, now on the other hand, I'm more the sort of fellow that really needs looking after. If you don't mind. Oh, but I do mind, terribly. Will you please leave me alone. Do you really mean that? I certainly do. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, it looks as though I made a fool of myself. Absolutely. Oh Minna, I think I'll have coffee in here. Hello, everybody. Will you excuse me? Yes, I'll take care of it, you toddle along. Mr. Lawton and I will have a little chat. I'm terribly sorry, Mannister, but I don't believe that I want to have a little chat. You're very rude, Mr. Lawton, after all, Mr. Mannister's my guest. I know all about that. But that's no reason why I should stay here and talk to the idiot. If you'll excuse me, I'll go. Going? - Yes. Home? - Yes. Would you mind taking something with you? What? - This. Well hit, sir. Caught on the boundary. I'm a little impatient, I guess it's my nerves. I think somebody had better help Mr. Lawton to his car, if you haven't broken his neck, Dick. I'll see him to his car, Miss Hastings and I shouldn't worry about his neck. There's a bloke in a mask who'll look after that for him later on. Come on, old boy, come along. Thank you, he deserved it. I'm afraid I spoiled Reggie's fun. I just beat him to it. Mr. Drake, what are you doing out of bed? I'm sorry. I was walking in my sleep. Come on, wake up. Wake up, come boy, that's the boy. What happened. Oh, you just took a little nap, that's all. Oh, by the way, anytime you feel like a sleep, just pop 'round, we're always in you know. Good night. You know, it's fearfully stupid of me to be just sitting here, doing nothing. Really, I know some men who'd consider spending a sunny morning with me a little bit more than doing nothing. Oh, come off it, now. I didn't mean that. Well just what did you mean? You were always so vague. Oh, am I? I mean, do you think so? I certainly do. Well, I might surprise you someday and be very direct. I wish you would, Dick. What did you say? I said, I wish you would, Dick. Ah, wish I would what. Oh stop this, come on, be direct. What? Well, ask me something. Uh, ask you what? Anything. All right, I will. Could you, that is, would you... - Yes? Well, do you think that you could... What? Make me some tea? - Oh! Dick, Dick! Dick! Reggie, what on earth... Hello, how are you? But, well where did you, how did you get? What is this all about? Listen old man, I just spotted some marvelous scenery over the mountains and I came back to pick you up. Pick me up? - Yes. Not on your life. I don't ride this sort of horse. By it I spotted tons and tons of water. Water? Yes, perfectly ideal for your cattle. Then I'll risk it and come with you. I knew you would as soon as I mentioned cattle. Here you are, put these on. A plane, look! He's circling the dam. He's flown right over, someone's snooping. Looks like hells going to pop right now. You stay here, I'll ride over and tell Lawton. Right. Hey, Boss! Lawton! Yeah, quickly. A plane has just flown right over the dam. What? They spotted it I tell you. That plane hopped right over the dam itself. They not only saw the dam, but they must have seen where we turned the water back on this property of yours. You'd better think fast. There's only one thing to do, Black. And I'm relying on you to do it. Blow out the face of that dam. Oh, you're crazy. You know what will happen if all that water's turned loose? I know what will happen if we leave that dam as it is. I can't let that crowd know that I had anything to do with the drying up of Rangle River. Maybe you're right. Hello. - Hello. Wait a minute, I've got a lot of questions, I want to ask you two. Where have you been, where did you get the plane, and where are you going? Reggie got the plane to show me a place in the hills where we could water the cattle. We're riding up there at once. May I come too? Oh, well, I'm sorry, Miss Hastings, you see we're in a fearful hurry. Well if I can't come there's something wrong. What is it? We'll explain when we get back. Come on, Reggie. - I'm coming too. You're doing nothing of the sort. It's a long and difficult ride and no place for a girl. You stay here and wait for us. But I... - I'm sorry, Marion. Come on, Reggie. Look who's coming. Hello, Drake. - Hello, Drake. How do you feel? - How's your head? I'm all right, Reggie and I are riding up in the hills. When we come back, we'll have a surprise for you. What have you got on your mind? You'll find out soon enough. I've got spots before the eyes, look who's coming. Well, here I am. - So I see. But this is as far as you go. Watch her, Barbwire. If she tries to follow us again, I'll break your neck. Come on, Reggie. Shoveling for water, eh? They'll soon get a bellyful out of this I bet they won't like. Yeah, we'll give 'em something to really howl about. Fill her in, but be careful how you shovel around that charge. Don't worry. Snooping over this dam in a plane? Well none of that Rangle River crowd better be snooping up the river bed when we touch this off. I say, Dick, Black might try and break away to the north. Hadn't we better separate? That's a good idea, Reggie. You ride straight up the river bed to the dam. I'll veer to the left up there and go over those hills. Right. - Meet you at the dam? Okay, take care of yourself. - Right. Here's where they get all the water they want. Now a couple of minutes and hell itself will roll down the valley. Out of here, quick! There's a flood coming, get the cattle out of here! Where's Marion? - I was just going after her. She swiped a horse and got away. - Which way she go? - Straight up the riverbed. I'll go and get her. Get the cattle out of here, come on! Marion! Marion! Marion! Marion! Marion! - Help, help! What's happened? She was caught by the water, help me, Barbwire. I've got to get up to the homestead as soon as possible. Where's Mannister? - I don't know. The last time I saw him he was riding up the riverbed. The flood must have got him. He didn't have a chance, come on Barbwire. Oh Dan, I'm so glad you've come. In heaven's name, what's happened since I've been away? I saw it from the bridge, why when I left the river was dry. I don't know, Dan. A flood came down about an hour ago. It's a miracle and it'll mean everything to... What's happened, Dick? - My dear! Take care of her, Mrs. Abbot, she's had a bad time of it in the flood, you know what to do. - But what's happened? Lawton's had our river dammed up for his own use. He blew up the dam and flooded the valley. What about Mannister? I'm afraid the flood got him, Dan. What are you after, Dick? - Lawton's. What do you want? What do you come here for? I've come here to get my share of you before the police get theirs. What do you mean? I mean that I've got three things to settle. Your trying to steal Dan's meat contract, the drying up of Rangle River and the drowning of Reggie Mannister. Get up! No, you won't touch him, you won't kill him, no! Let go! Well, come and get me, Drake. Well, Drake, how do the like piece you're getting of me now. There, you are Dick, go to it. Here you go, Dick. Get him! - That's how! Do it again. - Haw, that's it. Yeah, that's it. - Ah, let him have it. Go on, that's a beauty. - You've got him. Go on, snap it. - Ah that's it. - Ah, that's a beauty. - Yeah, come on get him. That's it! - Go on! Go on, now you've got him, Drake. Hooray, hooray! Well known gangster takes a ride. Oh dear, phew. Phew. Thank you. What ho, the Queen Mary! Well, Rangle River certainly looks itself again. Yes, it is beautiful. It's not the only beautiful thing around here. Ah, Marion, there's something I wanted to ask you. Yes? I wanted to ask you if, uh, if you, don't think, Rangle River certainly looks itself again. Yes, I certainly do. And I uh, I wanted to tell ya, that I uh... Yes? I, I guess we'll have plenty of water from now on. Oh, Dick! Bad manners. - Useless. Absolutely! Hey, hey! Quick, quick!
