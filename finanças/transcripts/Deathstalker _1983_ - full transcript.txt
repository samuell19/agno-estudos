No! No! No! God, no! No! That's my horse. Our fight is not with you. I've taken some treasure here. And a girl from the valley. I'll share them with you. The one who lives here won't be very pleased. Let him fight for it, then. Take it all. It's yours. Take it! I intend to. This just isn't your day, is it? What do you want? Your name. Outside... Wait for me there. Fuck. This isn't my day, either. Get any poorer. You're gonna have to eat that dog. I hope it'll be as tasty as the one you're enjoying. Real kings Iive in castles. Like Lord Munkar. Munkar was my magician. That castle was mine and will be again. It is said that once an entire army marched against him. A real army. Munkar waved his hand and turned the whole army into a flock of sheep. An army isn't the way. A brave man could get inside Munkar's castle and kill him. You need a fool. No. A hero. Heroes and fools... ...are the same thing. I'll offer you anything you like! Even all this isn't worth much to a sheep. I'll give you position. You can stop living like an outlaw. An outlaw is free. He's taken my daughter from me. In olden times, there were great heroes. Men who'd ride off to save a maiden with never a thought to their own lives. Well, those days are gone. I steal and kill to stay aIive. Not for the luxury of glory. Things have changed since your father's reign. Haven't they, Princess? I want the sword. I am Kang. General of the great Lord Munkar. It's your duty to give up the sword. Be on your way. I will not give you the sword. My Lord! Hyah! Hyah! Taste of my magic, Kang. Hyah! Your powers are nothing without the sword, Kang. Or is it, Munkar? With this amuIet, the life blood of generations, I change my form and slip your grasp. Get the amulet. -He is heIpless without it- Hurry! Lord Munkar's sorcery-.- reaches even here. What was that amulet? It is one of the Three Powers of Creation. Munkar controls two powers. He came here as Kang to get the sword. The sword? Join three things separate to be the power. More powerful than Munkar. Toralva, don't talk to me in riddles. Just as the amulet is the key to life so the sword is the instrument of justice. I will tell you how to find it. With your strength and courage, Deathstalker, you can use the power in the sword to get the amulet. He who wears it cannot die. With sword and amulet, you can take the chalice, and reunite the Three Powers of Creation. Look! Let me show you. Munkar already holds the first two powers. The Amulet of Life and the Chalice of Magic. You are very close now to the power, Deathstalker. But it will not be yours for long. The power wiIl come to he who becomes a chiId. Toralva, you're sending me into battle against sorcery. Would you stop talking to me in riddles? Power is nothing if it is given to you. Go! Reunite the Three Powers. And after they're together? You can do anything. You will be the power. Deathstalker! Your thirst should be only for the First Power. Enough riddles. I'll just take my chances with my sword. Look behind you! Salmaron waits there. The keeper of the Sword of Justice. Why didn't you just... ...say so? Salmaron? I was sent by Toralva. She gave you something to safeguard for me. I live in this damp cave, trapped, eating mice, moss, bugs. And you come here looking for gifts? Move it, move it, rats! Cockroaches got 'em. Stalker! Stalker! Catch! The Third Power. Oh, what now? -Uh-uh-uh! You don't have anything to eat, do you? No, I didn't think so. It-- It cut through stone! You must take me with you. I don't think so. I'm a victim of Munkar's curse. I was once a man like you. A warrior. Brave. Dashing. Every spell carries with it a way out... ...that is no way out. Your riddles remind me of Toralva. I can only be led to freedom by a boy who is not a boy. With the power in this sword, you can set me free. You know, I'm not accustomed to the Iight. Been in this cave for 30 years. Oh, it's bright- Take my hand- I can't see anything. Ah! That's better. Kid, kid. Where are you? Wh-- Uh-oh! Dashing and handsome. Are in the eye of the behoIder. What will you do with it? Reunite the Three Powers. And I will be the power. Munkar will set many traps for you. Choose your allies well. Get down- Somebody's coming! I'll be right back. Hey, come on. Get here. Oh, yeah! Come on. Get him! Get him! No! No! Damn! -Yah! I know who you are! Your timing's perfect! Hyah! Circle him. He can't fight us all. I owe you my life. My name is Oghris. Stalker. No. No! Just running past on my way to Munkar's castle. If I'd known your allegiance was with Munkar, I'd have let them kilI you. It's not loyalty that takes me there ...but fighting. This has the makings of the greatest tournament ever. I don't know a warrior in the land that's not bound for it. -The tournament? Never fought for a prize like this before. To be made Munkar's heir. Think of it. That doesn't sound like much of a prize to me. lnheriting everything from a sorcerer who never dies. No one's time lasts forever. I'Il ride with you to this tournament. Thirty years of frogs and... toads, tubes, and... spiders, and things l don't even know what they were. That's a... magnificent sword. May l see it? Spirits. Spirits don't make noise. Come out and show yourself like a man. Whoever you are. Kill him and you'll die before his eyes are closed. Show yourself. I'll take his hood off for him ...and his head. I had a dream we would meet two men on the road. I didn't think it meant anythingÂ¤ but now... Two men, huh? Dreams are not what they used to be! I may be a woman. My sword has cut down greater men than you. And I've dealt with better women, with a different sword. Enough! Save your boasting and your sword for the tournament. What are you doing here? I'm Kaira. I'm on my way to Munkar's tournament as well. Alone? You ride the rest of the way with us. I'll join you until the contest begins, then I'll stand by no one. Then it wouId be my pleasure to be the one you stand against. Be wary, my friend. Of what? A dream? Where's mine? Deathstalker is camped outside the city, my Lord. Very good. --Hmm? Hmm. -Hmm- I feel... Hmm. MAN: Mmm- Perfect. You should put a sparkle in Munkar's eye. Ah... yes. Come on! To the castle. -Yes- More wine! More wi... Mmm. Gotcha! Some wine. Think she likes you. I bid you welcome to my kingdom. I have ruled longer than most of you have Iived. Now l'm old. My time is near. But only the strongest will take my place. We shall see in the battles of the next two days who will claim my kingdom and whether good... or evil... will rule. Evil! So I expect. But the tests begin tomorrow. Tonight you are my guests. And aIl that I have is yours to share. Food, drink... ...women. And in honor of this occasion, the first appearance... of my newest prize. Who will stand for the court in this most pleasant bout? Me! Me! Let me do it! Me! Yes. You are perfect. -Hey! -Hey! No! Please. No! Please let me... Stop him, please! Stop him, please! -I'll help you. -Please, stop him! Oh, oh, oh, oh! No! PIease, stop! Please! Were you planning to take her with you? For the night, anyway. She is mine, you know? But I think she fancies you. l'lI have her sent to your chamber, when the... ...excitement is over. Oh! Hello again. Thank you. Not again. My Lord, Deathstalker is alone in his room. Ah, little Howard. Here, kitty, kitty-- Oh. Deathstalker will not live to compete in the tournament. Good. I would hate to see him win and become your heir. You cretin. There will be no winner. And when the contest is over, there will be no warrior alive strong enough to oppose me. -Ah! You will kill the winner. -Yes. And you will kill Deathstalker ...tonight. I will take ten of my best men. You will go alone ...with this. Someone he won't suspect must kill him. He won't suspect me? He won't suspect... Princess Codille. But she would never... Wait, I know what you're thinking, don't... No! Oh... What? I... It's... It's gone! Oh, my Lord. Oh! Uh-huh. Oh, my Lord. This is very uncomfortable. Then, finish quickly, my princess. But you must do it when the sword is not in his hand. Come in. We have plenty of time. Until the guards have gone to sleep. It's coId. We'll fix that. Who are you? I'm Princess Codille. No! Yes! Who...? What the hell are you? Get out of here. Go on! Shh. What...? Let's get you something to wear and get you out of here. What's wrong with you? Careful. lf you're hurt... you won't be as much fun later. Stalker! Let the tournament begin. Oghris! -What are you about? I've been waiting 30 years for this. I trust you're comfortable. I am not! And this is no way to treat the man who brought you Deathstalker. You could have ordered them to be a little more gentile. I want him dead. Well, I can do it. Not so easily. With that sword in his hand, he can't be harmed. Then, I'll get it away from him. No. After all, my Lord... I am his friend. Do it, then. Munkar plans to kill you tonight. Forget the tournament. Leave. Good-bye, my friend. When the sun sets tonight, one man will stand the greatest warrior of all. Now watch the man you thought might help you. The Chalice, the Amulet, the power. You can be the power. All the power comes from me. The Chalice, the Amulet, and now the Sword. Alert the troops! Search everywhere. I want Stalker dead. No... No. Nice. Behold! The Amulet. Munkar! I am here, Deathstalker. I've been waiting for you. All the power comes to me. -AIl the power comes to me. -All the power comes to me. You have no defense against me. He does! Deathstalker, do not alIow iIlusion to become fear. Embrace the power, take the Chalice! Deathstalker... The power is still mine. I don't want your power. But I want this world rid of you. These powers controlIed men too long. No! You don't know what you're doing! You fool. You've ruined everything. Kill him! Get... Kill him! No! All the powers of creation and chaos. I destroy you.
