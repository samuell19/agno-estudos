- I wouldn't touch that piece if I were you, Clint. - Miss Diana I thought you were... - In the shower? Now raise both your hands up and turn around! Nice and slow. - Have I been a bad wrangler, mam? - Nothing a little roll in the hay can't fix. - Oh Penelope our first real vacation! I feel like we've been freed from office hell. - Don't mention the office, please! I mean look we've got the green grass, the blue sky... Ah the fresh country air! This is the good life! The double "D" dude ranch. - Yup, best in the west and we are going all the way. - Into the sunset? - Bare-backers add on, you better believe it girl. - Alright girls final stop! - Something feels really special about this place! Like home sweet home. I know we're gonna love it here, I just know it! - Morning ladies, welcome to the DD. Don't worry about your bags I'll get that later. Name's Lucky Luke. - As in lucky to work in paradise? This place is way cool! - Titillating ain't it? - Are you really lucky, Lucky Luke? - That's a double "D" guarantee. And you are? - My name is Annie. - And I'm Penelope. - The good the bad and the tender feet. How's about I show you to your rooms? Well I could use a foot rub. - Don't be silly Annie c'mon! - Well ladies here's your room, this is the end of the tour. - Wow, everything is so beautiful! I can't wait to go explore, everything is just so good! - Yea, thanks for showing us around. - Need anything just holler, we're having a campfire at dusk, hope to see you two ladies there. - Man I'm gonna love this place! Me too! - Why don't we go freshen up before we hit the trails? Finest... little lady. - Come with me. - Have a seat Diana. - You can barge in here! - Luke let us in, isn't that right Dirk? - Yep. - Sherrie Underwood, of all the dirty dealing scoundrels on this side of Hatchet County the answer is still no. - Not even a peck on the cheek? You haven't even heard my proposition yet. - Cut and run Sherrie! How many times do I have to tell you? This ranch has been in the Dean family for six generations and I aim to keep it that way! - Do you hear what I hear Dirk? - I hear something alright. Sounds like squawking. - We're done, we're double done now get out! - Feisty aren't we? - No, I've got a suitcase full of money saying that we're not done. We're just getting started. - You're dirty money isn't welcome around these parts. Underwood! - You and your horse pecker boyfriend sure make a nice couple, sure would be a shame if something were to happen to him. - Out! - This ranch will be worth nothing but a dust fart after that highway is diverted I can see it now, the dust dried dude ranch. - Out! - Well Dirk it looks like we've outworn our welcome again. - Where to now? - To bed of course, c'mon. Well there's no other way, we gotta do it. We won the ranch and the oil. - What about that wrangler, Clint? - Don't worry about him, I'm his poison. - You're mine. - Shyla, now that's a pretty name. - All the boys call her Shy because that's what she is. La la la, ain't that right? - Jill's such a liar. All Shy girl really wants is a man to lasso her panties off. - I hear ya, all men should be rugged and rough. - You always have a dirty mind. - Hey just give me a pair of spurs and a mustang and I'll melt sugar into gold. - Man's gotta have a body like buried treasure, "X" marks the spot. You got that right. - You girls sure are giggling rich. That's what I like to hear. - Penelope over there's looking for a rugged suitor. - A birthday suit? I've got one of those. Perhaps I could oblige her. - Oh yea, suit me up! - I had fun today, thanks for showing us around. - It's all in a days work. You two ladies came in on the late bus. Just a few hours ago. - Straight from the airport. - And not a ranch hand in sight to help us with this horrible jet lag.. - Ding dong, I think you both just struck oil. - How so? I know a ranch hand sure can grease a skillet if you're not too shy. It works wonders for jet lag. - But it's a bit "nippley" out here. - I'm talking cool hands and a warm fire. Ladies, you game? - After you. - Have fun! Enjoy! - Sherrie Underwood is a disgrace to this community, her money and her damn highway. I am not gonna let her muscle me out of my family's ranch. - She's never been nothing but a damn dirty tramp. And as for that other one, Dirk, dill rod or whatever his name is, if he lays one finger on you... - This ranch, Clint, it's all I've got. The Double D is my only home. - Dian Dean don't you worry, I got both hands in on the Double D pot. We can handle this. - You're the best. - Gotta fight fire with fire. - Wow, where did you get this stuff, Annie? It's got some kick. - Lucky Luke gave it to me. - Now pass me that whiskey, mam. - So uh, is that your six shooter? - That there is my pride and joy. Little Clint. Best damn revolver from Abilene, Texas to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Or is it Taluca Lake? - Well I bet you know how to shoot a load or two. - A man can learn a lot working out here under the stars. - Yea, they're really beautiful. Like a whole field of tiny winking bullets. - Would you like me to show you them stars up close? - I'd like that, yea. - Hey! It's loaded... - So am I. - Careful now, one squeeze of the trigger and Little Clint goes boom. Lights out. Now c'mon, hand him back over. - So tell me, are you a real honest to goodness cowboy? - Baby, I got fire in my eyes. - Wow. Say... why don't you teach me how to shoot sometime? - Are you serious! - Only if you're be hard on me. - Oh baby it'll be hard, real hard. - Have you ever dreamt of living in the big city? - Honey, I've had my share of traffic jams, one night stands and rat race honky-tonk. The Double D it's all that matters now. - I wish I could be free like you Miss Dean. - Don't let life do you sweetie, you gotta lick it clean before the river runs dry. - Have you ever kissed a girl? - Um, I've kissed a girl or two yes, why? - Well, sometimes Penelope and I... - Shh, I know just what you mean. - Good, good! Watch the kick on that. Hey that's not half bad. You keep this up and you'll out shoot me, and there ain't nobody in this town better than me. - I bet you say that to all the city girls. - No, I only say that to ones with the breasts... I mean best aim! Diana? Hey, hey now calm down, what's the matter? What? We'll be right there. - What's wrong? - It's Diana, let's go check it out. - Clint! Over here, over here. Come! - What's the matter! - It's the aquifer, pipe's been sabotaged. There is no water. - Well hell! - I don't know, we're screwed! - You don't think... - Who else is it gonna be? - Could you please tell us what's happening! - Quiet, now when did this happen? - Sometime last night? I mean the ranch is almost completely dry. - Those low down dirty sons of bitches! - Oh this is awful! - Miss Diana, Mr. Clint... - What is it! - I think we can switch to the backup well and at least have a little water coming in by nightfall. It's not perfect but... - Will it hold? - A day or two... - I think that'll be our best bet. Thank Lucky. Now get to it. - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait... Take the truck and report this to Sheriff McQuaid, tell him that there's been a rat here and we're gonna take care of the problem. - Will do. - Kid sure is lucky. - Yea but what are we gonna do! - You stay here with the girls and I'm gonna nip this snake in the bud. - You mean... - Yea. I'm gonna pay our friend Sherrie Underwood a little visit. - Give her my regards. - Could you please tell us what's happening. - It has to do with the ranch. - Are we in danger? - I don't think so, I'm not gonna let anything happen to anyone here. That's a Dean family promise. - And the water? - Lucky, he'll take care of that. - Diana, who is Underwood? - Sherrie Underwood, she's just a sleazy lawyer. She's been harassing me for weeks trying to buy the Double D. I guess she's just jealous of my double D's. We all are. - Well girls, c'mon now, I can take care of that. Follow me. - Here we go! Cheers. - Your whiskey is dry Underwood, single barrel? - You still double barreling it? - Why were you talking to Diana Dean yesterday? - I wanted to take your girl for a spin that's all. - Aquifer went to hell this morning but you already knew that, didn't you? - Are you accusing me of something? - As a matter of fact I am. What did you do, have one of your henchmen go over and sabotage it? - You know I never kiss and tell. Come here, let me show you something. - So... - I can't be bought that easy, you should know that by now. - I... own you. - Thanks for the hooch but if I ever see you or Dirk creeping around the Double D it ain't gonna be good. Happy trails. - So what's the verdict? - I guess we're gonna have to scare them off. - People scare better when dying. - Shh, shh, shh. Hello? The Sheriff! Consider it done. So Dean's unlucky gopher had a run in with the Sheriff, tipped off the pig, even mentioned us by name. - Where's that pecker at? - Probably on his way back to the Double D. - I don't think he's gonna make it. - Right on time. - What the... Slippery oil? What's this all about? - Good morning! - Howdy miss. You do realize this land is property of the Double D Dude Ranch? - That's why I'm here, sir. - Slippery oil, what's that? - Just marking these areas for Texas T, apparently this land is filled with it. - Texas T... Wait a minute! Who sent you here? Did Miss Dean send you? - It was... Sherrie Underwood. Does that name ring a bell? - Bat shit on a dime it does! - It says here she's the sole owner of the Double D Ranch. - Underwood? Oil? Hmm... wait a minute. - Is he gone? - Shh, keep it down. Aw son of a duck nosed signal! Probably just a hunter mistaken us for some game. - You saved my life Mister! - I's lucky is all. - Are we safe here? - I know, come with me just keep down. - I think my truck is just down that hill. - Swell! - You know back there you didn't have to do that for me. - Sometimes the risk is worth taking. - I think I need to repay you for saving my life. - Clint where are you! Clint! Did you get Underwood to spill the beans? - The only thing Clint spilled was his load. - Underwood! What have you done to Clint! - Your bull was here I satisfied him. - What do you want from us! - You know exactly what I want. - The Double D will never ever be yours. - There's something that you don't know about me, Diana. - And what's that? - I can be a real bitch when I don't get my way. - Lick my boots Sherrie. - And when I don't get my way I huff and puff. - Bring it on tramp! - And when I huff and puff Double D's get blown to dust. - Get to the point! - Sell or face the consequences. - I oughta grind your face in the mud. - In other words... - In other words... go to hell you crazy bitch! - I suggest you hightail it outta there before the devil himself gets to the Double D. - Tell the devil we're ready. Clint? Is that you! Sherrie... I just talked to her on the phone I think her douche bag of a boyfriend is on his way. - It makes sense. I saw a strange truck out on the dirt road. It must be his. - What are you gonna do! - What a man's gotta do. - Be careful. - Dirk! I know you're out there, come on out and let's settle it like men. - Over here. - Well I guess this is it, huh. Whenever you're ready. - Say go. - It's over, Dirk. It's over. - You heard him, honey, it's over. - So is it true what Diana and Clint were saying? - What were they saying? - Oh... just how you saved the day and all. - Well if it had anything to do with me being a six shooting cowgirl from the big city... I'll take that. - Hey now trying to steal my sweetie? - Well my hands are always in the cookie jar. - Now could I have everyone's attention! - Honey you can have the whole enchilada. - Well I just wanna thank all you ladies for supporting the Double D and with the extra money we have coming in we wanna make you all permanent members. - So you mean we're part of the Double D family now? - Girl, saddle up. - Now I especially wanna thank this pretty little lady over here. If it wasn't for her I don't think I'd be standing here in front of you all right now. Penelope, you done good kid. Real good. Thank you. - To Diana Dean and Clint! The best in the west! The best in the west! - Celebrate!
