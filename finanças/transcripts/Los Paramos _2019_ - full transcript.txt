When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers, they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another. Psalm 105: 12-13 - Hello. - Hello. Have the other workers left already? Yes. How's your husband? Lying down. How do you know? One of the girls told me the other day. Is that woman picking you up today? She's my sister. Is your sister picking you up today? No. How are you getting to the village? I'll walk. Over there. Thank you. Move, will you? I'm watching TV. - Leave your phone and eat up. - I don't like it. That's all there is. - I won't have any dinner then. - Fine, don't have any. - Hi, Tito. - Hi, Fadrique. I've brought the potatoes from the veg patch. Fadrique, leave them in the kitchen. How's it going, Piedad? - What are you up to? - Nothing. I've been collecting almonds. Dulce gave me a hand collecting them. Hey, Fadrique... Where do I put the gas bottle? Over there. Fadrique, close the door, it's cold. Listen up, Aurora. Listen up. Do you think you can leave your husband in a place that looks like a store room? Listen, I want this place cleaned up. Just look at it. You gotta do more cleaning. You do nothing by the looks of it. What will people say if they come in here and see you living in a pigsty? These lands had a different name in years gone by. They were inhabited by other beings. It is said that those beings founded cities. The prophetic stones with which they were built possessed an ancient power. It is said that such dark power keeps us confined amidst a mirage which makes us believe that we truly exist. But no one remembers anymore. How long you gonna stay in the village? Until I get posted elsewhere. I got word you've been seen with ''burnt face'', in his car. If I find out you've been seen with another man, gypsy or not, in his car, I'll break your legs. What are you doing with your life, Aurora? What are you doing? You have a husband. I'll thrash you. - Who's ''burnt face''? - Shut up. Fadrique, keep still. Look what your son is doing, babe. Stop it, Fadrique. This floor cleaner smells really nice, look. We'll have it. - Can I sit in the front seat in the car? - We'll see. Gosh, my arms are aching from collecting almonds. - I don't know when we'll get a holiday. - Soon, I guess. Why don't you want me to pick you up from work? - I just don't. Fadrique, take the trolley. - I don't mind. Don't worry, I'll walk. Sit in the back, the boy's going in the front. Put your seatbelt on. Sit still, Fadrique, and put your seatbelt on! Will you sit still, Fadrique? Fadrique, do as your aunt says. If you don't put your seatbelt on, you'll have to sit in the back. - Can I touch the gears? - No! Guess who's leaving the village, babe. Jessica and Jose. The village is gonna end up empty. I don't know what we're gonna do. Look, Tita, there's a fire over there. Hey, babe, something is on fire, for real. - Can I get out, Tita? - No. - Please. - No, it's dangerous, Fadrique. - Come on, please, Tita! - Are you getting in? - No, I like walking. Shall we meet tomorrow? Alright. At eleven, on the road out of the village. Alright. Come here and sit in the sun, babe. It's glorious. - What's going on? - Nothing. - Are you drunk? - No. Give me a swig. - Are you gonna tell me? - There's nothing going on. - Are you gonna tell me? - I saw your husband in the store room. - Standing up? - No, lying down. He will have stood up to put his suit on. I spat in his face the other day. Stop it. Stop it, will you? The bird is dead in the cage. - Did you feed it? - Of course I did. - Is it dead? - Yes. - Why is it dead then? - How should I know? - Don't mess with that. - Look, Mum! Come on, Fadrique, it's time for bed.
