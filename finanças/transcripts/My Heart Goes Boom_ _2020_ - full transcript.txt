I got home late. What a crime, missing Rosa! I don't like her. I think she's an amazing artist. She sings better every day. What's with her? She came to get married. No way. She got dumped at the altar. Look at her face. -Like she came from a funeral. -Poor thing. Yeah, poor thing. Though what she's wearing is at the very least a Valentino. NIGHTS WITH ROSA Sorry! Sorry! No, it was me. I was distracted. No, I'm sorry. I'm on the moon. Thank you. Okay. Don't worry. Too many things! Why are you dressed like that? Sorry, I didn't mean to... Last call for passengers flying to Paris. Sorry, that's my flight. I have to go. It's important. I'm sorry. What the hell is this? Italian money? Either pesetas or you can walk to Madrid. It's all I have. Please. Excuse me. Are you all right? Oh, sorry. But is that a Valentino? I mean the dress. It's a Valentino, right? -I don't know. -You just arrived from Rome. I saw you. I love Italy! Such great designers. But this dress is... spectacular. Sweetie. Why the long face? It's his loss! If it were me, I'd drag him by his balls all the way to the church. Have you somewhere to go? Nowhere to spend the night? Such nice fabric. I like you I like you I like you I like you... THREE MONTHS LATER It's incredible, but I melt for you - like you -Again. I like you I like you So much, so much, oh! This weird dance That we're doing here Is called the Tuca Tuca I made it up Feet! -So I can tell you -Hips! I like you, I like you, I like you I love you Very nice! That's why I want to be like this And when you look at me I know what you want from me -I did it. -Yeah. I nailed it. -Yeah? -Sure. Tuca Tuca You dance better than any of the Rosettes! Don't be silly! Talented and modest! Talented and modest! Welcome to Barajas International Airport. This is Amparo. We've modernized our baggage-claim system with brand-new luggage conveyor belts. Please be careful not to confuse your luggage... Excuse me, miss. My suitcase didn't come out. I'm sorry. We've modernized the system and-- It's you? -The gentleman with the handkerchief. -Yes. Well, Pablo. Pablo Cuesta Larios. I didn't know you work here. Yeah, well, it's temporary. Color? I wouldn't know what to say, but... I guess blue, like the sea. I love it. The color of the suitcase, I mean. Of course. Of course. Gray. Sorry. Not gray. Brown. It has a white cord hanging from it. This is strange because you're the last person I saw when I left. And then I get back... Is it big or small? Excuse me? The suitcase. What size is it? Medium size. Normal. Normal. -It's lost. -What? It must be in Asturias or Uruguay. Who knows? No, no, no, miss. My doctoral thesis is in that suitcase. It's very important to me. My whole life and professional future depend on it. Hope is the last thing you lose. I can't believe it. My father is going to kill me. Look, give me your address, and we'll get it to you as soon as it shows up. Yeah? I'll give you my work address. It's easier to locate me there. I have to go. I'm sort of in a hurry, but... Thank you. Call me if you hear anything. Thank you very much. Maria! What? My name is Maria, and blue is my favorite color too. Nice to meet you, Maria. Thank you. Goodbye. Sir! Gentleman! Your suitcase! Amparo! Maria, please don't leave the desk. Show some interest, or they'll fire us both. Sorry. Can you ask the truck to deliver this suitcase today? The truck doesn't leave until next week. Okay, give me that address. I'll take it myself. Are you crazy? No, you're nuts. You'll get me in trouble with the supervisor. -Is he looking this way? -No. Really! Did he see? No. Okay, go. Come back in one hour. If you take longer, we'll both be in trouble. Is he looking? If you leave like that, he will. Excuse me, Mr. Pablo Cuesta? -They're going to fire her. -For sure. You were dancing with your feet stuck to the floor like two stakes! I didn't bother writing a code of good habits so people could ignore it. It's right here. "No dancing with your feet stuck to the floor." If you do, the dance loses its gymnastic quality and turns into something erotic. -This is how I'd dance. -For God's sake! Why don't you wear the headband and dance a bolero in my place? -I quit. -Bolero? How dare she... You can't say "bolero." It says so right here! Please, wait! And you, Chimo. I'm sick of the obscene shots of legs and cleavage your cameramen keep taking. Decency, sir, decency. And you guys, do you like giving me more work? You know the censorship department will take it out later. Amateurs! At this rate, we won't have any dancers left for New Year's! -I don't care! -Well, I do! Okay, girls. Let's adjust some things from the other day, because it didn't look right. From the top. I like you I like you No. Please do it right. From the top. I like you I like you I like you so much, so much Good. We're done for today, okay? But I'll make changes. Who are you? Nobody told me we were doing a number with... stewardesses from the airport. No, I'm Maria. I'm a friend-- Well, I'm not a friend. I came to bring this suitcase. You're a dancer. -I like to dance. -You don't know who I am? I'm Chimo, the director of Nights with Rosa. Could you dance a little for me? But I'm not a dancer. But do you dance or not? Wait a second. No dancer with blood in her veins can resist this beat. Sorry. What do I do? I don't know If it's true or only a dream Go on! Yes, I will be The star of this sky I never get tired of dancing I just have to wait Because victory will come I dance, dance every moment I dance, dance I feel it inside I dance, dance I make up a step Nonstop, nonstop, nonstop! I jump, jump from note to note I dance, dance It drives me crazy I keep going, keep going The fatigue Will pass, will pass, will pass Dance. It doesn't matter Seeing time pass And I'm still alone Who cares? Yes, yes. I spend my time with music I never get tired of dancing I just have to wait Because victory will come I dance, dance I don't fall in love I dance, dance I'm a prisoner I dance, dance my whole life Nonstop, nonstop, nonstop! I jump, jump from note to note I dance, dance It drives me crazy I keep going, I keep going The fatigue Will pass, will pass, will pass! I dance, I dance every moment I dance, dance I feel it inside I dance, dance I make up a step Nonstop, nonstop, nonstop! Bravo, Maria, bravo! You were fantastic. The time! Maria, you were-- Maria! Maria! Watch out. -Maria? -Pablo. I mean, sir. -My suitcase! -Yes. I didn't know you worked in television. Yeah, I help my dad in the audiovisual content department. That must be fascinating. Yeah. Anyway, sorry about the mix-up. And good luck with everything. Bye! Maria! Yes? How can I thank you? Buy me coffee sometime, or anything you want. Of course. Hey, Pablo. You got your suitcase back? -Yes, yes. -Great. And I've got my thesis too. Very important, that thesis. Your future depends on it. Because your destiny is here and you'll make it on your own merit. Take it from me, Celedonio Cuesta. To destiny. And to you dancing on TV! Yeah, but with the cameras off. Okay, yeah, that's true. But who cares? I hadn't danced like that in years. I felt so free. I'll get it. Maria and Amparo's residence. Speak without offense. Hey, Pablo! How are you, handsome? Give me that! -Here. -I'll hand you over to your Maria. Yes, hello? Hi, Maria. It's me, Pablo. How are you? Fine. Fine, fine. Sorry for calling so soon, but your phone number was starting to fade. I thought you would write it down on paper. Right. That was another option. But I don't mind at all that you called so soon. You don't? Well, I'm glad. Yeah, I'm glad because I wanted to call you. And, well, there was something that... I wanted to mention. Sorry, yeah. I was thinking that maybe you might want to go with me tomorrow for a stroll in Retiro Park. Retiro Park tomorrow? Retiro Park? How romantic. I love it. Perfect. Bring a friend, and so will I. A friend? Oh, right. Look, I'm here right now with... -Lucas. -With Lucas. And I think he might like the plan. So it's confirmed then. Then tomorrow at noon at the park. See you there. Great. -Bye. -See you tomorrow. You are so lucky! It feels like yesterday when I met you at the airport crying your eyes out, and look at you now. Yeah, but all that... is in the past. And the past goes... -Fast. -Fast. Massimiliano. The airport. Hello? Yes, go ahead. Any information could be important. To Madrid? Pork-lard sandwich. I don't know, classy. I would love a boy to take me for a ride in Italy on one of those. Like Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday. How are you, princess? -I'm great, cutie. -Let's go. Hey, would you take me for a spin in Rome on your scooter? What? To see the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Tower of Pisa... I'll show you if you want. What? My leaning tower. Did you hear what that rogue said to me? Take a hike! Scoundrel! Bye, gorgeous! The other one threw a peanut at me! -Uncalled for. -He looks like a chimpanzee. Lucas, don't. Okay. There they are. There they are. That's them? I'm dying! What a couple of angels. Hey, don't get up just for us! Hi. -Lucas, right? This is Amparo. -Come here. That's how you greet someone. -And Pablo. -Hi. Sorry. Sorry. The one with the handkerchief. I'm Maria. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise. Let's take a stroll. -Great idea. -Yeah? Sure. Has anyone ever told you you look like Robert Redford? Never. -How are you? -Good. You look just like him. I'm so tired. Sorry. -Sorry. -Thank you. What a gentleman. Where are you from? Me? From Bilbao. A northern boy! That's great. Are you from the capital? Southern girl? Of course, Madrid. Can't you tell from my accent? I'm from here, from "Madrith." Thanks for the invitation. No way. Thank you for my suitcase. That thesis is my life. What's it about? Professional deontology. You're a dentist? No. No, no, no. Not at all. Deontology is what teaches us to separate what's right from what's wrong. Like what's decent from what's indecent. And for that you have to study? Yes, of course. Philosophy. Philosophers have been debating it for thousands of years. Well, it's perfectly clear to me. Yeah, but things change. Look, for example, 400 years ago, people thought women didn't have souls. A man's opinion, of course. Did you dream about being that when you were little? You said, "When I grow up, I want to be a professional deontologist"? No, no. When I was little, I wanted to be a guitar player. -You play the guitar? -Yeah. Yeah. I know how, but I don't because my father thinks it's a job for hippies and lazy people. -Really? -Yeah. He's a bit conservative. To the boats! Let's go to the boats! Okay, okay! You're quite a pirate. Pirate, pirate. Here, give me those. What's wrong with you northern boys? A little birdie told me you're very shy. -We freeze up in the cold. -Oh, yeah? I'm going to heat things up in a moment. Just in case the world ends I have to make the most of it Heart of a wanderer I'm searching for my freedom I've traveled the world And I've realized that Where there is no hate or war Love becomes king I had many experiences And I've arrived at the conclusion That when innocence is lost The south is more fun To make love right You have to come south To make love right I'll come to you Without lovers How do you get well? Without lovers This life is like hell To make love right You have to come south What matters is doing it With who you want And if they dump you Think no more Find a better guy Fall in love all over again They say love is the friend Of madness But since I'm already crazy It's my only cure We're so vulgar sometimes We don't even know it We'll fight for our love Just to show it I had many experiences And I've arrived at the conclusion That I've lost my innocence The south is more fun To make love right You have to come south To make love right I'll come to you Without lovers, how do you get well? Without lovers This life is like hell To make love right You have to come south What matters is doing it With who you want And if they dump you Think no more Find a better guy Fall in love all over again Find a better guy Fall in love all over again Find a better guy Fall in love all over again WELCOME TO MADRID Here you are! Mr. Chino. Chimo. -You're a hard girl to find. -Yeah? I've had to search the airport I don't even know how many times. I'm sorry, I guess. You can't just burst into my life, dance like that and disappear. What kind of person does something like that? I'm sorry. I didn't want to lose my job, and I had to hurry. Well, that's exactly what I'm here to talk about. A new job for you. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT What's this? What you see. Your days as my assistant are over. Just like me, my father before me, now it's your turn. Congratulations, my son. Give me a hug. Give me a hug! You're Spanish television's new censor. Okay, okay. I knew you'd like the proposal, but not that much. It's not that. You'd never called me "son" before. Well, I think it's time certain things changed between us. I admit we've never had a very close relationship, because, with so much work, life hasn't given me time for trivial things. But anyway, it is what it is, right? What do you say then? Are you ready? You know I am. But what about Chimo? -Everyone thinks the job is his. -No, no way. He's a degenerate with no morals who only cares about women. You, on the other hand... Thanks to the severe upbringing instilled in you by your late mother, with my help, of course, you belong to a class of man that almost doesn't exist anymore. Your head isn't full of birds. You're practically a priest without a robe. So of course the job is yours. I swear I won't let you down, Father. I know. I know. Let's slow down. Unfortunately, this place is a nest of jealous vipers. And the last thing-- the last thing I would want would be for one of them to insinuate that this promotion is an act of nepotism. That's why, before the position becomes official... I need you to work for me in the shadows. How? You'll make the decisions, of course, under my temporary supervision. And in the next executive board meeting, when the Minister congratulates me for a brilliant job done, I'll show them that they were actually witnessing your good work. That way, nobody can say it was for my connections. Exactly! I'll be able to retire in peace knowing that our country's morality and good habits are safe. Go ahead, my son. You have to straighten out those suggestive, herky-jerky Rosettes. For God and for Spain! -Hi. -How are you? -I have news. -I have news. You first. -No, please. -Go on. -No, really, I insist. -You, you, -Please. -Two beers, please! No, no, it's just... I'm abstemious. What disease is that? No, I don't drink alcohol. Maybe today deserves an exception. -Can I give you a clue? -Okay. Maria... I'm a Rosette! -What? -Yeah. The other day when I went to return your suitcase-- it was silly-- I was copying one of the Rosettes. -And Chimo saw me dance... -Chimo? ...and he liked what he saw, because he came to the airport to offer me a job. You're not going to say anything? Congratulations. -Right? -Of course. I guess. I mean, I didn't know dancing was so important to you. Important? Look, I grew up in a convent where any type of personal expression was forbidden. The nuns were constantly beating me with a wooden ruler for dancing. Even still, I couldn't stop, because my dream was to be a dancer. Then you get older and life makes you give up on things. But now's my chance. I hope they have TVs at that damn convent so those nuns can see me dance freely all across Spain. Waiter! Another beer, please. What about you? I was so excited I didn't ask. -Me? -What were you going to tell me? -Nothing. -What? Don't be silly. Tell me. Come on, what? I got a bigger desk. They put a bigger desk in my office. That's it. A desk. It's destiny. We'll be working together under the same roof. But you know that nobody can know about this. About what? Maria, the station has a very strict policy forbidding couples in the workplace. Did you say "couple"? Yes, I said "couple." To us. To us. -Come on, girls, line up! -Come with me. Let's see. Ready for the check. We record in-- Let's see. Okay, Rosettes. I want to see them all. Rosette number one. Okay, good. Okay. Perfect. This skirt... Yes, eight centimeters. Good. Rosette 5 okay too. A little higher right there. Eight centimeters. Good. Eight centimeters. Good. Twelve and a half centimeters! How can it be? Is there a problem? What's the maximum allowed? -Eight centimeters, sir. -Eight centimeters. Wardrobe! Yes, sir. -This skirt is too short. -Sorry. Don't let it happen again! But you just gave it to me. -Yeah, but it has to be lower. -Everyone on the set! -It's important. -Loli, please, let's go. Come on. Excuse me, where are you going? I'm going to dance? -Chimo, can you please tell... -Marta. Maria. ...the new substitute to sit over in that chair until I say otherwise? Thank you. I'm sorry, Maria. Sorry about the mix-up. The Rosette who quit was replaced by the old substitute. So "the chair" was left vacant. Don't worry. I'll be here. You call me and I'll be here. Always ready, sir. Stop calling me "sir." You don't need to be so formal here. Just call me "Chimo." "Chimito," "Chimon," "Chichi." Anything you like. "Chimo" is fine. Just sit there and stay in line. You have a great career ahead of you here. Let's go, everyone! We should be recording already! What's wrong? All good, Maria? How stupid of me to think I'd be dancing my first day. Don't worry about that. I'm sure your chance will come soon. What's the whole thing with the ruler? That's my father's thing. I'm only his assistant. Remember... Remember what we said about deontology? Well, he's the one who says what's decent and what's not. -Very funny! -This is indecent? Yes. Decent. Indecent. Decent. Indecent. Decent. Indecent. Decent. Indecent. Decent. -Indecent. Decent. Indecent. -Maria, please. Excuse me, but... I think it's nonsense. Well, my father thinks we have to control all of this. All of our viewers deserve to be cared for. I'm a viewer and I can take care of myself. Ready. Three, two, one. Music. Hot, hot Hot, hot CODE OF GOOD HABITS DO NOT SHOW CLEAVAGE Hot, hot Hot, hot Hot, hot Hot, hot My body's been going crazy It's loose and I can't stop it You can't stop it I wake up at night hugging the pillow Wishing for love Wishing for love Maybe it's because it's spring Maybe it's because You don't kiss me anymore Maybe you have another woman Who wears you out And you get home too tired to love Hot, hot Hot, hot Hot, hot Hot, hot My body's been deserted By kisses You want to kill me He wants to kill her The prize goes to the first gentleman Who kisses me He won't be sorry He won't be sorry Maybe it's because it's spring Maybe it's because You don't kiss me anymore Maybe you have another woman Who wears you out And you get home too tired to love Maybe it's because it's spring Maybe it's because You don't kiss me anymore Maybe you have another woman Who wears you out And you get home too tired to love CODE OF GOOD HABITS Maybe it's because it's spring Maybe it's because You don't kiss me anymore Maybe you have another woman And you get home too tired to love It's spring You don't kiss me anymore Maybe you have another woman And you get home too tired to love Hot, hot Hot, hot Hot, hot Hot, hot Honey, you know I can't help you right now. But once they give me full control over censorship, I'll give you all the camera time you want. Yes? Oh, sorry. Maria, darling. I'll come back later. No, no, it's okay. She was just leaving. Come in, come in. Come on, let's go. Please, come in. Sit down. -How are you? -Fine. What's up? I don't want you to take this badly. I don't understand. When... When you offered me this opportunity... Big opportunity. Big opportunity. Yes. Well... I thought I was going to dance. And you will. I promise you will. Someone with your talent can't stay in that chair forever. But, unfortunately, a certain amount of time has to pass naturally. Right now, all the spots are taken. Unless you want me to fire one of the Rosettes. No, no. Fire one? What an idea. Maria, if you ask that favor of me, I would do it for you. Right. Look, I'll wait for my turn to come. Really. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Bye. You can always quit and find a more normal job, right? Quit? What are you talking about? Nobody quits here. Tomorrow we'll buy a statue of Saint Clare of Assisi to pray to her. Saint Clare? Maria. Saint Clare-- Patron Saint of Television. What nonsense, Amparo. No, Amparo is right. In 1254, Saint Clare got very sick. '52. '52. And since she couldn't go to mass, God projected mass for her on the wall of her bedroom. And the Vatican recognized it as a miracle. Look, you both know me and you know I don't believe in that stuff. And secondly, I'm not so desperate that I need to pray to some saint -or a magic little girl or whatever. -Suit yourself. Don't come crying to me later. Have you tried my michirones? -No. -Smell, smell. This could raise the dead. Smells good. Maria, gorgeous, can you come to center stage? -Me? -Come on, we don't have all day! Ready? Camera. One, two, three. And adjusting cameras. Higher. Higher, Maria. Higher. Straighter. Higher. A little more. Straight. Lower a bit on your left. There. Okay, thank you. Goodbye! Goodbye! Ready! Everybody, get ready. Let's go, everyone! Let's put all the meat on the grill! -Recording! -Move the ladder! Okay. Good. Sorry. Come on, kneel with me. Let's see. Repeat. Saint Clare... Saint Clare... ...Patron Saint of Television. ...Patron Saint of Television. We want to ask you for a favor. We want to ask you for a favor. Okay, let me. Anyway, this girl here has a very big aspiration. She wants to dance, on television no less. But don't think it's a whim. When she-- Well... The thing is... At her job, there's a handful of girls who dance much worse than her. Right? And we were thinking that to give the girl a chance, maybe, well, you could make one of them trip -and maybe break her leg. -Amparo! -It's not their fault. -Shh, be quiet. Ask for this and they give you this. Ask for a break and you get a sprain. I'll talk. Okay, but do it right. Go on, talk to the saint. I know I haven't talked to your people in a long time... since my time at the orphanage. But that's where I realized how much dancing matters to me. We were little girls nobody wanted, but we'd dance in secret and we were happy. And for a moment, I understood the meaning of love. And, after all, isn't that what we all want? To love... and be loved? You're so sweet. -Hey, but... -Yes? I want to ask you something. It's probably silly. But I was thinking the other day, and I remembered. The day we bumped into each other at the airport, you were wearing a wedding dress, weren't you? Yes. How awful. I just can't imagine how somebody can be so cruel and leave their girlfriend on the most important day of her life. Actually, I left him. Sorry. What a relief! Yeah? Yeah. I mean, I thought maybe he had left you and you were still in love with him, and I got worried. Not at all. I already had my doubts, but since he was my first boyfriend... When I was about to go inside the church, a bird landed right in front of me. And I looked at it, and it looked at me... and I knew what I had to do. Besides, that's all in the past. What matters is that I'm with you now, right? And you're nothing like him. Sure. Come on. Arriving flight from Rome, exit door number 4. -Here you are, sir. -Thank you. -That's Maria. -Maria? Yes. My Maria. You know her? Yes. She worked here until recently. That's a miracle! Do you know where she lives? No idea. I think she lives with Amparo. Amparo? -Do you know her address? -No, I don't. But we took the subway together on Friday nights, and she always got off at Iglesia. -That's all I can say. -lglesia Station. Okay, thank you. Goodbye! Was it Iglesia Station? And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four and five, six, seven, eight. Up, four, five, six, seven, go and up. One and up, one and up, one and hook. No, no, no! Are you okay? Saint Clare, no! Sorry, sorry. -What happened? -I think I slipped. Right. By any chance, was it a three-month slip? -What? -Congratulations! You're going to be a mother! The doctor said I should stop dancing for now. I'm so sorry, Rosa. You just worry about taking care of yourself and getting some rest. And theoretically we should be prepared for any eventuality. Right, miss? Amparo. The miracle happened. -Somebody broke their leg? -No, no, no. Nobody got hurt. Much better. Marta is pregnant. I'm going to dance on the program. Yes! I can't believe it! I told you! Saint Clare works the best miracles! Yeah, okay, yeah. Bye! Did she hang up on me? Maria. How are you? -Nervous? -Totally! You look gorgeous. I just wanted to wish you luck. Have you got any advice for me? No. I don't know much about this. -Okay, never mind. I'll just be myself. -Yeah. -Well, Maria... -What? What? Yourself is fine, but not too yourself. What? My father will be out there, and very free things aren't exactly to his liking. What is this, the Inquisition? Dancing never hurt anybody. Bye! Come on, girls. Remember, today we have Polaroid choreography. So you know what to do. Give it your all. Let's go! What is Polaroid choreography? Instant choreography. Improvise, do whatever you want. Okay. Maria. You have a chance to prove yourself. Make the most of it. Wrong. Wrong. Hi! Wrong. What's wrong with her? It looks like she has a cramp! Who let that statue on the stage? Relax, she's warming up. -Wrong -Mama, what insanity -Wrong -Mama, it's my fault I don't know what it is It must be a weird idea -Wrong -Wrong, wrong, so wrong She's off. Wrong, wrong if I'm with him Wrong Don't say anything, no -Wrong -Not while I know Courage, that's right Courage, all right here Courage is what I've got I'll never leave him Even if he wants me to Courage, my love While I suffer I'll fight for you I'll fight for me Wrong Wrong Wrong Come on, Maria! What did I tell you guys? There! What is she doing? I trust you'll know how to proceed with this one! Great job! Thanks, everyone. We're done for today. Bravo! Fantastic, fantastic! I couldn't have done it without you. What are you talking about? You're a star. Maria! Maria! -Don't cry. -No. You're my favorite. Come up to my office. Okay. -I'll change and come up. -Okay. Ana! My favorite dancer. Have you seen Pablo? No, but he should come to congratulate you, right? Yeah. Wait for me outside, and we'll leave together? Of course. Go on, silly! What about you? Sorry. What about me? Why have you been avoiding me lately? You think I was born yesterday? But that's okay. Anyway... See you later in the bar? You owe me several beers. How about it? -Yeah, okay. -Great, see you later. Sorry, I have to go... -Perfect. -...back to work. Okay. See you soon, angel! Maria, you were sublime. Thank you. I'm going to tell Rosa to put you in the first row. Really? Of course. It's where you belong. Come on. Give me a hug. -What are you doing? -What about you? You're a pig! Maria! Hail, Caesar. Let's go! What happened? Nothing. Pablo? I don't know. I haven't seen him anywhere. But-- Tell me what's wrong. Come back here. Father, the angle won't change what you see. No, no, no. You don't see a lot of things, but they're there! Maria just started. She's new. Let's give her some time to learn. You learn before you come here! I trust you, Pablo. So what do we do with this girl? We'll start by cutting the riskiest stuff. Are you sure? Look. She's a phenomenal dancer. And that's what people want to see. With all due respect, I think your father is stuck in another era. Yeah. He is a little old-fashioned. I could watch her all day. She really turns me on. If we leave her in the cut, Spain will fall in love with her in one minute. Not just Spain. Even Marlon Brando will come looking for her. The story happened suddenly And I still don't understand it If you don't mind, I'll tell you Maybe you can help me He was a boy with golden hair I was almost madly in love with him I was more faithful to him Than I ever have been to anyone And I never found out What happened to him Because one afternoon From my window I saw him hugging a stranger I don't know who it was Maybe an old friend After that day I never saw him again Lucas, Lucas, Lucas What happened to you, Lucas?

They're so excited about me finding a man. Anyway, that Chimo is such a lech. Tell your boyfriend and they'll fire his ass. I've been calling him all day, and he won't answer. I don't know where he is. -Good evening, Spain. -Look, it's Rosa! We offer our most cordial welcome to Nights with Rosa... Good evening, Rosa! ...everyone's show. -I present you the Rosettes! -There you are! One, two... -That's you! -Here 1 go! Now, now, now! Doesn't that hurt your neck? Look, here you come. Here comes Maria. -There! -No. -Was that you? -No, no. Wait, yeah. Look, look at you. That's me far away. That's right, you're far away. -Now! -There! Okay, now you're closer. What a pretty bird pose. -You nail it. -Okay... -That one. -Yeah, but my back. But what a back! Excuse me. Do you know if this girl lives in the neighborhood? No. Maria! A SPANISH TELEVISION PRODUCTION "TVE." Hey, I saw your face. A flash, but I saw you. No, they cut me out. Even worse, they censored me. I don't know. I don't get it. Doesn't your boyfriend work in that department? Yeah, but he's an assistant. His father makes the decisions. And he obviously hates me. Yeah, call him. Call him. 03-03-456 I'm waiting by the phone For you to call Meanwhile Meanwhile, you know the number If you want If you want, I'll repeat it for you 53-53-456 I dial and dial, nobody answers And I can't take it anymore Loneliness tonight Is bad company My breast wants to feel your weight And it's getting desperate 03-03-456 I'm waiting by the phone For you to call 53-53-456 Time has passed And I can't wait for you anymore My finger is red from dialing so much It moves by itself across my body And dials without stopping 03-03-456 Why won't you call me? What are you thinking? You want me to call? You want me to call? I never will A little more A little more and I'll leave 53-53-456 The telephone says That you're not there Pablo? Amparo. Yes, the phone works. I'm hanging up. Pablo might call. -Yes? -Hello? Lucas? -How are you, handsome? -Amparo. What happened? You didn't show up. No, I had to stay at work late. Okay, no problem. You don't have to explain. How about tomorrow? Want to go the movies and see a western? Tomorrow? No, we have to go to Pamplona to record Holy Mass, and I have go early to load the truck. Do you understand? Okay. The thing is, I saw you. Walking down the street with-- with a boy who... I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about, Amparo. I don't. That's okay. Don't worry about it. I'm very modern. There are tons of those back home. Yeah. I'm sorry I was such a nuisance. No, please. You're a wonderful woman. I'm sure you'll find someone much better than me. You'll see. You don't have to say anything, really. Okay, see you around, sweetie. Okay, kiss. Take care. Honorable board, Mr. Minister, I want to take advantage of our annual meeting to announce my retirement... but also to introduce the person who will succeed me. Don Pablo Cuesta Larios, my son. What? He's by far the most qualified person not only because of the link between us, but because he has a degree in professional deontology, and he's an example of morality and rectitude, unlike others. In fact, the last Nights with Rosa program was cut entirely by Pablo. Yes, we had the chance to see that program. Very subtle work. Precisely, based on the last broadcasts, we were talking about the urgency of renovating our role on television. Of bringing in new blood. But with all due respect and appreciation for your work, we were hoping for a different style. Especially considering that the New Year's special is coming, the most-watched program in all of Spain and our biggest opportunity to capture new generations. New blood, renovation, New Year's. I don't understand where you're going with this. Well, Celedonio, you've seen British TV, French TV, even what's being made in Italy, no doubt. Of course I've seen them. A genuine disgrace. That's why we have a moral obligation to maintain the norm. We Spaniards are the last bastion of Christianity in Europe. It's our duty to combat lust and debauchery. And Pablo, blood of my blood, will perpetuate this ideology no matter who it upsets. Or will I have to call the caudillo? Or even better, his wife. Come on, that's not necessary. After all, we delegate the decision to you. We're sure you'll make the right one. And if you think your son is the most appropriate option, I'm sure you're right. He's the appropriate person, yes, sir. With me at his side as a consultant, of course. Go ahead. How can you be so despicable? How dare you! You're only doing this to me out of pure envy. -Envy! -Yes. Because I've gone on dates with almost all the Rosettes, and that's something you can only dream about. No, not all of us have the bar so low, right? That's fine, thanks. Pablo, Pablo! What's wrong? Where were you? I looked all over for you. I told you I was busy preparing for the annual board meeting. Oh, yeah, that's right. -Did you see the program? -Of course. Of course I did. -Your father hates me. -No, he doesn't. Don't say that. He erased all my shots. Maria, it's normal. All legs and cleavage get cut. Is that all I am? Two legs and cleavage? Maria, I would never say that! Because he erased everything. Sorry. What am I doing? Overwhelming you with my stuff. Don't be silly. That's what I'm here for. Besides, think about it. You wanted to dance, right? There, you danced. Who cares if you're in the final cut? It doesn't matter. You're kind of right. You're a saint. I'm going to work. I'll see you later. Um... Bastard! You wanted to see me? -Yes, please, have a seat. -I'm fine. I'm sorry, but... I wanted to offer my sincerest apology for going too far with you. I was wrong. I was wrong, and I have no excuses. But even more important, I wanted to apologize on behalf of the station. The way they cut you out of the program is truly a betrayal to modern dance. Well, at least I danced. What are you saying, Maria? What's the point if nobody saw you? Like the great Confucius says, "If a tree falls in the forest and nobody saw it fall, it's like it never fell." You understand, right? Look, in editing room 186, on the third floor, you'll find the new censor cutting the program. We don't tell the dancers this SO you won't go up and complain. But they'll have to listen to you, Maria. -New censor? -Yes. The one who cut your program. -186. -186. 186. Everything before in a wide shot. This one is all set. No, cut this one. Look at her hair. It's very provocative, isn't it? I don't think my father will approve. Yeah, that hair is clearly saying, "I'm a communist." It's you? Tell me it's not true. Maria, take it easy. I can explain everything. How could you do this to me? Excuse me. Do what? What's she saying? You are not... -What are you doing? -Sorry. I'm sorry, Rosa. I can't do it anymore. I quit. Can you please give us a moment? This is about those men upstairs, isn't it? Sit down. You see that poster? THE ROSE OF CADIZ Beautiful. I was the same age as you. The movie gave me fame and also my name. Keep a secret for me. My name is Angustias. Imagine it-- Angustias of Spain. They couldn't break me. No. And they've discouraged me many times with their comments, their censorship and their big ugly flowers. Yeah. I've fought so many years against those stupid rules that I've even reached the point where I thought maybe I was wrong and they were right. No. No. No, now I know it was worth it. I've managed to change so many things. When I started in film, we couldn't even show an ankle. What nonsense. Now it's your turn, Maria. I know you won't give up. I know that rebelliousness and that will to fight. You have to keep dancing with me for all of us. Can I give you a hug? No. Do you know this girl? Her name is Maria. Sweetie, I can't believe it. He looked like such a good person. Liar. Shameless. Back in my village, we've always called that shameless. Not even the Pope can avoid it. I find a decent guy and he turns out to be a fruitcake. Maria! Maria! -Can we please talk? -No. We have to talk. Please. There's nothing to talk about. You don't understand anything. -Oh, I don't. -No, you don't. My father forbade me from revealing my real job. I couldn't say anything. Did he forbid you from putting me on the show? -You even cut my smile. -No. No, I was only doing my job. Or at least what everyone expected me to do. If you at least said you like your job, but no. You tell me you do it because it's what's expected of you. Look, it's just... I have nothing to say to you, coward. Maria, please! Olé! Like a lady! That's telling him! I can't believe it. What a pain, this shameless guy. Let's see. Although it's pretty romantic. I wish a boy would go crazy over me like this. You don't know what you're saying. That's enough! I'm sick of-- Massi. The Italian? Maria. But... Sorry I didn't call first. I've been looking for you for days. I've crossed seas of tears to find you. All I ask is one minute, and I promise you'll never see me again. He's a poet. Come in, come in. You'll catch a cold. Come on. Come in. I'll make coffee and bring some pastries. All "fantastichi." If you need me, I'm in the cucina. Grazie, bella. "Bell"? I haven't got any bells. But I can lower the blinds for a more romantic atmosphere... Okay, forget it. Bye. One moment. I'll take a little piece. -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. -I shouldn't have left like that. -No, it's my fault. -It's just-- -l wasn't sure. And you didn't deserve that. That's all I wanted to say, but... you left so fast that... I couldn't give you the apology you deserved. Okay. I'l go. Going? No way. Sit down. No fighting. Where are you going? I don't know. I'll find a hotel and go back to Rome tomorrow. A hotel at this time of year? No way. The city is completely packed. -It's okay. I can sleep at the airport. -The airport! No, stay in the back room. It's not five stars, but you'll sleep "fantastichi." That way, we can watch Maria's program. Maria's dancing in the New Year's Eve show. If Maria's okay with that. -Poor thing! -If it doesn't bother you. Everybody listen up for a second! As you all know, for the first time in the history of our program, we'll be broadcast live in all of Spain. Oh, I'm trembling. You're hilarious, sweetheart. Our special guest has just arrived at the studio. So let's please all behave like professionals. All right? Okay, let's get to it. Let's go. Wardrobe check. Take your places, please. Perfect. Good. -Excuse me. -Yes. Good. Good. Very good. You don't like my legs now? I'm just doing my job, Maria. Your father must be very happy. Congratulations. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. As many of you already know, I am now in charge of controlling decency and good habits at this studio. We'll be broadcasting live tonight, which means we won't be able to cut... the scenes afterwards. If we make one single mistake, the whole country will witness it. In a few minutes, 30 million people will be watching you, and their sensitivity... is in my hands. Sorry. Therefore I ask you all for your collaboration... by containing any excessive swaying of your hips and avoiding any movement that may evoke sexual ideas... -of any nature. -Yes! So, please, let's get to work. Thank you very much. Thank you. Chimo, please, we're touching him up. Loli, Loli! Please, your bow tie. One moment. -What hair! -Good. Glitter. Stop, stop. I think I'm going to faint! -My love. -My love. He looks taller on TV. -No, you can't eat these now! -No? With the clock chimes ding dong. NEW YEAR'S EVE WITH ROSA Did you find it?

My love, it's okay! Evening, Officers. Celedonio Cuesta, at your service. I'm the one who called you. Who's the director of this pornographic program? I was going to say. That's him, in the gold shirt. Camilo Sesto? Me? What is it, Officer, sir? As the person responsible, I have to arrest you. -Me? -Let's go. I suppose you'll also arrest the degenerate who showed her... Before justice, he's the only one responsible. -But... -Officer. You saw how that woman was dancing. That should be illegal too. Look, Grandpa, we don't care about that. What's illegal is showing nudity on television. -Unfortunately. -Get moving. Let's go! Get moving! -You can't arrest me! -Let's go! He's lying! Scoundrel! Traitor! I can't take it anymore! -"Grandpa." -Always the same story! Rumors, rumors! I don't feel safe Safe, safe alone I'm alone I wish I could go back in time Back to the time we spent together To kiss and hug you again Nevertheless, I ask myself why I have to always remember the past They say you're coming back But I think they're only rumors, rumors Alone with my grief It's impossible for me To feel safe, safe Safe alone I'm alone I wish I could go back in time Back to the time we spent together To kiss and hug you again Nevertheless, I ask myself why I have to always remember the past They say you're coming back Amparo? Maria Mari Why must destiny be like this? Maria Mari You went away And left everything here Maria Mari You taught me everything I know With all my friends, I'll sing to you This song that's dedicated to you I don't know what to do. Come back to Rome with me. Leave this place and give us another chance. As you know, all of Spain is talking about the peculiar musical number broadcast this evening. And while no doubt there has been a public outcry, many have called in to congratulate the bravery and openness shown by this studio. Congratulations, Pablo! We cleaned the house! I couldn't have done it without you. You have no idea how proud I am. We got rid of that long-hair Chimo and that demonic troublemaker. Father, I love her. What are you saying? What are you saying? What you just heard. I'm completely in love with that woman. Please! Your emotions are all tangled up. Don't confuse apples and oranges. That you like certain things doesn't mean you're in love. You're fired. You can't fire anyone. Yes, I can. I remind you, I'm the director of this department. You're just a consultant now. And it's about time things changed around here. Don't you realize? That snake charmer absorbed your brain! You're the only snake charmer here. Down deep, you know I never wanted a part of any of this. You didn't? Then why did you take the job? Because I'm a fool. All I was ever after was your affection and admiration. Of course, without ever realizing... you're incapable of those things because you only love yourself. Oh, Maria, Maria. Thanks. Who will I dance with in the living room now? I'm the biggest disgrace on television. What disgrace? Maria, if the world is crazy, it's not your fault, okay? You're the greatest artist I've ever met in my life. Well, at least I tried. Yeah. I think Massi is right and I should go back to Rome, no? Yes. Will you be okay? Of course, I will. Don't worry. Better alone than in bad company. Amparo, you're the best! Thank you. I love you. I love you too. Go on, you'll miss your flight. Take care of yourself. -Goodbye. -I love you. I'll write every week, okay? Okay. -Ciao. -Ciao. Hello, good morning. The newspaper? Hello. The newspaper? Yes, thank you. Amparo! -What's wrong? -What do you think? What are you doing here? What do you think? I came for Maria. I don't want to insist, but I need to talk to her. Wow, now the romantic gentleman wants to see her. Yes, I do. I looked everywhere, but I can't find her. Where is she? She's about to fly to Rome. Please don't tell me she's leaving with the Italian. Not if you stop her! Come on. Wait! Where do you think you're going? Ticket, please. I don't have one, but... Mabel, don't be so suspicious. It's for love. For Maria. Like in the movies we like. I don't give a damn about love. Without a ticket, he can't go through. Have you got money? -Yeah, sure. -Come on, let's go! -Excuse me. -Excuse me. It's urgent. A ticket to Rome, please. Let's see. Look, you got lucky. There are two seats free. Two seats? Then we want both. -What for? -I can't miss this! -Okay, two seats. -6,000 pesetas. I'm 1,000 short. Here you go. 1,000, 2,000... 3,000, 4,000... Excuse me. THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA AT TVE "The beginning of a new era at Spanish television. Pablo Cuesta Larios, Spanish television's new censor, has announced a new era for television. The archaic and old-fashioned restrictions of the last decades have reached an absurd level that serves no purpose or person. Starting today, care for morality and good habits will be left to the discretion of each program and to the audience... who we believe knows how to take care of itself." -Massi. -You don't have to say it. I understand. I just had to try. Thank you. Take care. Are you sure? I have to dance. In the airport Last call Flight 325 My love, don't go Gate 18 I follow your footsteps I hurry to stop you My love, don't go Because without you There's no moon without you There's no life without you There's nothing The world doesn't turn and time stops Without you There's no laughter without you There's no strength without you There are no days No today or tomorrow There's nothing at all Someone got off?
