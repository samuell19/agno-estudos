I was born with seven clits. Well, seven that I know of. Seven that I can feel and touch. Seven separate clitorises, each one constantly craving attention. Actually, I'm pretty sure there are more than seven, but the others are buried so deep inside that only a doctor could find them. And I'm sick of doctors. Doctors probing, doctors touching, doctors, doctors, doctors. To some, I was a perfect example of permanent sexual arousal syndrome, but to most I was simply the girl with the crazy pussy. Look at 'em. Oblivious, completely unaware that a genuine freak of nature sits among them. And that's what I am, alright. A mutant, a grotesque abomination, a lovely little monstrosity. Wait, wait. Look at that bad boy swagger. What you think, auto theft? Sure. Drug possession? Assault, rape, murder, ah, that's where it gets interesting. Got 'im. Yeah, well it's not his IQ I'm after. He's just meat to feed the hungry beast. A beast so unique that I'm convinced I'm my own species, a new species. The doctors think I'm a genetic mistake, but I believe I'm an evolutionary leap forward. A female of the future who feeds on orgasms the way you people devour burgers and fries. By the way, I'm more than just a normal girl, and sometimes, most times, I wish I could find more than just a normal guy. You need that pussy eaten? Tell me about these. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil? Sully gave me that for witnessing him kill somebody and not sayin' nothin'. And this, that's the demon bitch that stole my heart. You like that one? Yeah. Fuck the world? That's how I'm gonna fuck you. No, come inside me. Why you dirty little cunt bitch whore. I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come. No, no, don't go there, just ignore it. It's not what you think, it's not a real baby. Real babies take nine months to grow, mine take less than two hours, which means my babies aren't real babies. My babies are fake unfinished freak babies. So just mind your own damn business and ignore it! Usually, I try not to kill 'em, but yeah, it happens now and then. Sometimes things get too rough, sometimes it's self defense, and sometimes, sometimes I just go nuts, and why not? I'm not looking for romance. I just wanna good fuck, then get out of my face and disappear. No names, no cuddling, just bounce. Especially when I'm knocked up, which is also happening a little too much lately. Then I just wanna find someplace private real fast, deliver my little freak baby, and dump it somewhere. Oh yeah, yeah, you're hot, you're really hot. Come on, big daddy, show me what you got. Yeah, you sexy bitch, look like you want it. How much do you charge, you cheap slut? Yeah, yeah, you big hunk of man! Lick them lips! Get 'em all wet. Tell me where they've been. Ooh, I love that ass! Come on, baby, shake it for me. Let me see what's under your hood! I don't know, something's missing. Give me the Maya with the 180 on it, I wanna experiment a little. I love a man in uniform! Get the fuck outta my lot, you dizzy twat! What the fuck is wrong with you? You got no fucking respect. Show no respect, you some kind of commie bitch or somethin'? The morals are gone because of people like you. Our country, we fight a war for hoes like you? It's disrespect for the country, disrespect for every fucking thing. Cause you show no values. Values the fucking toilet. Get the fuck outta here! Perfect, you can kill me now. That's a wrap! You know, you came this close, this fucking close to meetin' the king of Nazareth. Like it? I don't know. I got a whole album full. Go ahead, take a look. Hey Jen, I got this great location for the Mass Appeal shoot. It's this old 22 room mansion in Brooklyn. It's sick! Fatherman Preacher Divine used to own it. You want me to make it happen? It sounds good. Alright. Holy shit. I've never seen anything like these before. It's my secret collection of erotic photos. Sexy, yes? These are more like scary. It's a catalog of lovers, each of 'em caught in the throes of passion. Caught in their most intimate moments. I call it fuck face. These are, are really disturbing. I mean I can't tell if they're having the greatest orgasm of their life or if they're being killed. What's the difference? I'm just surprised. I mean, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but I always took you for a lesbo. Or one of those asexual never get laid types. I mean, I've never even heard you talk about boys. There's nothing to talk about. They're just anonymous strangers I meet at night in the bars, in the clubs, in the gutter. I started menstruating when I was five, and my periods have never been normal. I bleed too much, and a five year old girl with blood streaming down her legs really freaked out my parents. My eighth birthday coincided with a particularly bad period and I lost 1/5 of all the blood in my body that day. My horrified parents hospitalized me which is when we all learned just how different I am. ♪ Behold 10 horses, hell rider, hellfire ♪ ♪ Skull and bone crosses, yellow tire ♪ ♪ The world inspired omen offers peace ♪ ♪ If we follow his beast ♪ Was it good for you too? Among the many side effects of my mutant pussy's hyper metabolism, my reproductive organs function at an accelerated rate. When I was a little girl before I even knew what sex was, I used to walk around having multiple orgasms. Eight years old, at school, riding in my dad's station wagon, dinner with my family. All I'd have to do is cross my legs a certain way, bounce a little too much on my bicycle, or just playing in the backyard and I would come numerous times. I used to think everyone got off a dozen times a day. But as my vagina evolved, my body has gone into overdrive. For instance, conceiving, going into labor, and delivering a baby in under two hours is something sort of new for me. And something I initially found rather appalling. I mean, I could always take the usual precautions, but though I don't want any children, especially any of my freak babies, I love the feeling of something alive and kicking and pushing it's way out of me. Sometimes it's better than coming. We all know the phrase nymphomaniac is a pejorative term created by men who are threatened by a woman's sexual freedom. Men pride themselves on their own promiscuity while women are punished for it with labels like sluts, bitches, and hoes. Well I'm all of that and more. I may, in fact, be the world's only real life nymphomaniac. However, and I know you'll find this hard to believe, but I never had a man until two years ago. Between doctors and my parents, I grew up believing my cooch was something so dirty and disgusting that no guy would ever want me. All of which changed when I met Ryan. I thought I loved him, I gave him my trust. And when I told him about my strange little deformity, he said all the right things. Yeah, baby, you know you mean more to me than any physical problem. Can't let that get in our way. You can't let anything get in our way. Ain't no problem too big as long as we have each other. And what we have here, baby, is something special. So special I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. I love your lips, I love your hair, I love your skin. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, you're all I think of. I'll do anything for you, baby, anything. I wanna spend every moment making you feel good, making you happy, protecting you. You're everything to me, baby. You give my life meaning. This ain't about sex, it's about marriage and children, and growing old together. It's about us taking our love to the next level. I'll make sure you're first time is special, baby. I promise. I know you want me just as much as I want you. You feel it, you can feel it, baby, can't you? Get up. Get up, get up. What, what? Get up, come on. You gotta go, you gotta go. Ryan. You gotta go. Ryan. Come on, go. You gotta go! Ryan. Get up, get outta here. What are you doing? You got to get the fuck outta here! What are you doing? Get the fuck outta here you fucking freak! Get outta here! Get outta here! Get out, get the fuck out! Obviously, I do everything a bit differently now. Unlike other so-called nymphomaniacs, my needs are not psychological, they're physical. It starts with a moist burning itch deep inside, like a liquid flame that grows and burns until my pussy feels like it's on fire. Then it spreads pulsating through my veins, under my skin, up my arms, down my legs, and into my breasts, until my entire body's so hot and trembling it feels like my flesh is burning and crackling and turning into ash, and only an orgasm brings me back to normal. In other words, I need a dick the way a junkie needs a fix. For years I used to hate God. What kind of bastard creator would make me this way. I would fantasize about spitting in his face and ripping his eyeballs out and inflicting in him the same pain he's inflicted in me. But I've now learned to understand him. I now realize just how loving God is. He loves me so much that he's given me a gift. I can feel seven times the sexual pleasure of any human being. And now he's giving me babies. Not for me to keep, of course, but as a preparation for his holy child. God has been building and designing my body for one purpose and one purpose only. God wants to fuck me. I can feel your aura. It's glowing, breathing, it's all around you. You're protected by angels tears that I can see, you know that? You're funny. I'm funny. In a good way. As soon as you started talking there was such a strong sexual energy I could just feel it. It's very intense. I definitely think we have an amazing connection. I love your voice, it relaxes me. Really? I think you're just trying to gas me up. Trying to get me to take you home, but maybe I'm not that easy. Of course you're not. Boy, you're something else. I wasn't expecting to hook up tonight. I wasn't even in a social mood. Just relaxing, having a drink, and there you were. There's something very different about you. Something very exciting. Most girls won't let a guy hit it raw. Rubbers aren't natural. Well I feel comfortable around you, I feel alive. Like somebody's blessing you. Do you have any kids? Oh, that's complicated. I'm not there yet. I wouldn't be the world's best mom. I got twins. Beautiful little girls, just like their mom. And they call me. I loved that woman more than anything, but she's with some other guy now. I don't let it get me down. You can't let that negative energy flow through your system. You gotta get those positive juices flowing. Gotta think good, pure thoughts. Can I take your picture? Now? Yeah. Like this? Yeah. Sure. Gimme it. Wow, that was awesome. I'm really not the emotional type, but I think you're right, we really have a strong connection. Can you feel it? I mean, I don't know why, but I feel so close to you. You think that maybe we could see each other again? Yeah, sure. Whatever. What? Whatever? I will not be tossed away again. I'll not be used and toyed with and played with. I will not, I will not, I will not, I will. Oh my God, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my God. I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I thought there was a spark, a connection here, and I thought I deserved more respect and consideration than a simple whatever, whatever, whatever. It's my fault. It's not you, it's me, it's all me. I pride myself on not needing anyone, and what do I do? I got weak, I got emotional, and I actually thought that maybe you and I could... I'm sorry. Again, I apologize. This shouldna happened. It's just that in addition to my hypermetabolism, I'm also hyper-emotional. I can't help it, things just move faster for me. Imagine the emotions of meeting someone, falling in love, getting dumped, and hating their guts in all about three anda half minutes? It's my fault, my fault, my... My ex had a big dick, over 10 inches. I measured it. Oh, God, he owned me. I would cry real tears every time he fucked me. It was so amazing. I hate small dicks. I'd rather just finger myself. You're crazy, I had nine inches once and couldn't take it. I felt like I was getting stabbed. I'd be perfect for both of you. Not too big, but big enough. I mean, the ladies love it. I'm no John Holmes, but I know how to work it. Who? Holmes, John Holmes, the porn star. He had a 14 inch fucking cock. Ugly motherfucker, but did over 500 flicks and banged over 10,000 bitches. He's god. He's gross! Don't kid yourself. If he whipped his dick out right here you'd be on your hands and knees sucking it. 14 inches? Whoa, I'd fuck him in a second! I'd love to see how much of that I could fit in my mouth. Holy shit, how could you not want that? It's disgusting. He was so big he probably couldn't even get the damn thing hard. Who cares? It's 14 inches! Let him fuck me with just the head. I wanna be filled the fuck up! Dude, if I was John Holmes, I'd have a stable of hoes lined up around the block beggin' for it, and I wouldn't pimp myself out to those cheap ass fucking pornos either. They'd have to pay hundreds if they wanted to see it, thousands more if they wanted to touch it. Those pretty boys on TV, they ain't got shit. Bitches don't want that, they just want Johnny Holmes. Holmes cock didn't even look human. It was like some hideous fleshy tumor and was covered in veins so thick they looked like earthworms. I want a human cock, not some nasty, swollen growth, not something that looks like a dead eel. It's disgusting and gross and repulsive and nasty. Oh, fuck. Yeah, fuck me. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, fuck that pussy, yeah. Medication is rapidly acting causing erections. Erections within 20 minutes. Side affects include nausea, headache, dizziness. Stop it. Fucking stop it! Oh, baby, yeah, oh God. Told you to fucking stop it! Shut up! Shut up and fuck off! I'll be right there! Hold on, just a minute! I'm coming! One second! Yeah? Yo, what's up, dude, it's been a minute, what's the deal? It's me, Rem, you went to school with my brother. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey man, what's up? Chillin', man, everything's peace.

Plus this would be a great location for this photo shoot we're tryin' to do. I dunno, man. I mean, I'm thinkin' of turnin' this place into a club. I don't really want people comin' in... Yo, you don't wanna fuck this opportunity up, man. It's gonna be a hip-hop shoot. There's gonna be model bitches, some chronic, it's gonna be poppin'. You don't wanna pass this chance up. Ah man, I just wanna be left alone, alright. How 'bout a hundred bucks right now, just like that? I could really use five. For you, five, but I'm gonna need to come in... Yo, can I get it in advance?

You gotta find me something stronger, man. I got issues, man! But the shit you're lookin' for is fuckin' impossible to get, you dig me, pygmy? Look, my dude works at the fucking pharmaceutical warehouse. He's got dibs on any type of drugs any normal motherfucker could want. That's the key word, normal. You ain't normal, dude.

You're my Glen-Glen. Why are you so unhappy, why are you in so much pain? Tell me why. Let me help you, Glen. I wanna help you. You can't, you can't, you wouldn't understand. Of course I would understand. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. I love you, baby. I love you. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, you're all I think of. I'll do anything for you, baby, anything. I wanna spend every moment making you feel good, making you happy. I'll do anything for you. You give my life meaning. I've never told anybody. Baby, you know you mean more to me than any physical problem. We can't let that get in the way of us. We can't let anything get in the way of us. No problem is too big as long as we have each other. And what we have is something special. I got my dick got cut off at birth. The hospital never told us exactly what happened, but when they went to cut off the umbilical cord something went wrong. Of course, they sewed it back on, but it never worked right and it wouldn't get hard. So they gave me some money and they pushed me into therapy, but I was just a kid. It didn't hit till I was thirteen and realized I was the only teenager in the world who couldn't jerk off! Well, I could have got it up with certain prescription drugs, but my parents couldn't pay good money to give their kid a hard on. Wait till your older, Pops would tell me. Wait till your eighteen! Yeah, well thanks a lot dad, but I need my dick now! I tried to put my name in by lifting weights and getting into fights. I wanted to join the football team, but I didn't want nobody in the locker room to see it. So I just kept to myself and got the bright idea of injecting steroids and growth hormones directly into my dick, and it worked. Finally busted my first nut when I was 17 and ended up passing out for eight hours. But the drugs also made my dick grow, really grow. It also made my goddamn dick develop it's own consciousness. Meaning I got a drug addicted dick with a mind of it's own! So now I go from dealer to dealer lookin' for a chemical that can control it, that can make me behave normally. Fuck me, baby, fuck me, put it in... Oh yeah. Oh yes, oh yes, oh baby, yes! Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah! Oh, yeah. ♪ I'm the boss ♪ Damn girl, I could suck on that all night.

So I stuck it in and she went psycho. She's either having one big orgasm or hundreds of 'em all in a row, I can't even fucking tell. Yo, you're high right now, right? No man, I'm not, I'm just scared man. This ain't natural. I didn't even last. It was quick, just in and out. But she's been havin' an orgasm for like almost 45 minutes now. 45 fucking minutes! That can't be normal, that's like impossible, right man? Yo, listen. I'm not even near her and she's shakin' and moanin' like she's the fuckin' exorcist. It's like Linda Blair right in your fuckin' livin' room. So why you call me? You gotta give me something to shut her up, man. I don't mean knock her out, just something that'll snap her out of it so I can get her the fuck outta here! You got somethin' for that, right? Yo man, hit that ho on the head with a fucking shovel, shove a pillow in her mouth, call the ambulance, bury the bitch in the back yard, I don't know. Whatever the fuck you do, keep my name out of it. I ain't got nothing to do with you, cuz, none of this shit. I don't even know you, man. Alright, okay, listen. We're gonna go now, okay? If you can't walk, I'll carry you, okay? But I can't take you outside if you're gonna be screaming like this, you understand? Alright, I'm just gonna put this in your mouth just to shut you up, alright? I said no. No, keep wanting, I don't care. I'm not taking any more of that shit! It's making me sick. Look at me, man. My hands are shaking, my stomach's burning. What? No way, you saw what you did to her! She's probably still in the alley screaming her fucking head off! What? Yeah, well I fucking hate you too! Shut up! Shut up, shut up! Alright, alright, just shut up, shut up. Listen, we'll deal with this later, alright? Hi. Mr. Batten, I'm from the Neighborhood Block Association. We have some complaints about you. Me, why? The place is still yellow, the grounds are still overgrown, and the neighbors heard what sounded like... I like yellow. I'm thinkin' of turnin' this place into a club. No, no club! This is a residential street. You can't turn this place into a club! Can you say that again? I said, this is a residential street, you can't turn this place into a club! Shut up, shut up, shut up! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, wait. What was that? Mr. Batten, the place is still yellow, the grounds are overgrown, and the neighbors heard what sounded like a woman screaming last night. Wait, can you say that again? The neighbors head what sounded like a woman screaming last night! Oh, you don't need me anymore? You don't need me anymore? You don't need me anymore? Well here's what I think of that! Oh geez. Oh geez. Oh my God. Where do I begin? You realize we've lost the cover? There's no way we can use these unless we crop, blur out the faces, which kind of renders it pointless. I don't think we can use these at all. Our advertisers are gonna have a fit, an absolute fit. You know I've always supported you, trusted your professional instincts. I wanted you for this assignment because I thought you'd come up with something controversial, edgy. But this is so far over the edge. Remember the Cameron fashion shoot? We had two photos with a single bare nipple in each one, tastefully shot. Remember what happened? Walmart yanked the magazine off the shelf. Barnes and Noble wouldn't stock 'em unless we polybagged 'em at 50 cents per issue, which further killed sales because no one could look inside. And what have you come up with? Vagina faces! Jennifer, vagina faces! What were you thinking? It's all going down tonight. I'm actually going to go through with it. I'm all nervous and jittery and tingling inside, but in a good way. Like when I was a little girl about to rip the wrapping off a birthday present. I didn't realize how much I needed him until I finally found him, and now I'm all warm and getting goosebumps and I feel him as if he's racing through every part of my body! And it's about time. I deserve to be happy, I'm sick of being lonely. I wanna fall in love like everyone else. And why not? We were born for each other. Yes, I love you. I really do. You're my boo. You're the best I ever had. Yep, it meant nothing. Neither did he. Yep, none of them did. They were just, I dunno, I was bored. No, it's just you. Yeah, my boo-boo. No, honest, why would I lie? Get out! I was here last night, watching. I saw what you did to that woman, and I want you to do the same thing to me. Are you fucking crazy? You saw what happened to her. She could be dead by now for all I know. She couldn't handle it. But I can. I'm built for it, because like you I'm built differently. Forget it, girly, I can't help you! Not Girly, Jennifer. Yeah, well you're too late! It's gone! It came off and walked right the fuck outta here! So if you want it, you're gonna have to go out and find it! It's probably out there doing God knows what! I don't believe you. Yeah, well I don't believe it either, but that's what happened. So just, just get outta here and leave me alone, okay? After all I've done for it. After all the sacrifices I made! And it just walked out on me like this. No warning, no goodbye, just up and leaves in the middle of the night! My whole life revolved around it! When the doctors gave up, I'm the one that gave it it's health, nurtured it, made it something to be proud of, kept it alive with every damn drug it needed! And what am I? A goddamn junky who can't get laid while it's out there fucking whoever he wants! It's like, it's like, what do you call it? Spermatozoa. They got no eyes, no ears, no face, nothing. They only exist to do one thing in life, find an egg and fuck it! The same basic primal instinct is happening to my dick. It's like a radar. It wants pussy, it senses pussy, won't let nothing get in the way of pussy. The most perverse thing is, I can feel it while he's doing it. From out of nowhere, I feel like I'm the one who's fucking. And just when I think I might bust off, I realize I'm no longer attached to my own dick. Do you know how mocking that is? It's back. What's wrong with it? Withdrawal. Well give it something. It's had too much already. We've got to help it! It can't breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe! Just leave it alone and get the hell outta here! Is this what it wants? Hey, gimme that! No! Let go! Give it back! Just let go! No! No! I said let go! Don't die on me! It's getting better, see? No, no, no. Back off. Back off! Back off. Suddenly, everything was clear. I now know why I was put on this earth. I had long suspected that God had a special purpose for me, and had long hoped that someday we would be lovers, and finally we are. I can feel God deep inside me, a feeling that transcends mere bodily intercourse, transcends any sex any mortal has every known. This is rapture. I can feel it all inside me. The Garden of Eden, Sodom and Gomorrah, Armageddon, all inside my pussy. Plagues, famine, swarms of locusts, Joshua, Jacob, Jeremiah, Peter and Paul, and all the disciples deep inside my vagina. Heaven and hell, this is a miracle. I am a living miracle. Our father, who art in Jennifer, hallowed be thy name. God is finally fucking me and all I now want is to feel myself flooded with his holy seed. I'll introduce y'all.
