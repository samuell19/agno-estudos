Here you go. It's too expensive. It's worth it if you really want it. Why don't you get it? Come on, I know you want it. You can't do that. It's only illegal if you get caught. JD. Yes, Mom. I'm on my way. Yup. So... You didn't get the book you wanted? Why didn't you get it? You can't always get what you want. I disagree. You can always get what you want. I'll buy you that book. Come on. It's raining anyway. It'll stop. Let's make a deal. If the rain doesn't stop, you'll have coffee with me. Seven. Oh my God, it's still raining. You can't always get what you want. Eric is here. This way to backstage, sir. No, it's OK. I'll just stay at the back. This way, sir. - Eric! - Auntie. Your mom's been looking for you. There's no plan. I will never retire. Which is it? Dark-skinned or fair-skinned? Dark-skinned, right? So long as he's human. Sari, I have to go. Please take care of Mr. Domingo's trousers. - I will. - All right. - Bye. - Bye, Sari! Slim or chubby? Doesn't matter. So it's OK if he's a bit on the heavy side? So long as he's as cute as you, Mamon! Jackpot! He looks just like me! Ms. Sari? You believe that age doesn't matter, right? Don't feel bad. You're still young. You'll get over me. Never! You're the one I want to marry! What ever happened to courtship? But all roads lead to the church anyway. And I promise, Ms. Sari, I will never leave you. I will never make you cry the way my father makes my mother cry. I might be the one to make you cry, Mamon. Why do you say that? I'm not easy to love. Let's go home, Mamon. You can date her when you grow a neck! - Joke! - Mom! Stay out of this, Mom! She's out of line! And you're being a smart-ass! - Give me the baby. - I'm just telling the truth! - Telling the truth? - Yes! - Do you know the truth? - What? You're lucky, you're in college! Your uncle didn't graduate. Your brother finished only up to high school. Stop it you two! I can't stand you! It's all right, Grandma. Let's go. How long have you been a nurse, child? I'm not a nurse. I'm a seamstress. Seamstress? My son, Pablo, was a tailor. And my granddaughter, Sari... She's a seamstress too. You see this? She made a thousand suits just to pay for my surgery. She's very kind, pretty, and timid. But don't tell anyone. It's just between us two. You should go to sleep now, Grandma. You have to rest. How was your exam? Did you answer all the questions? Of course, Auntie. I hope I get a perfect score so I get a medal. Guia! Pack all your things. Yes, Uncle. Let the kids prepare their own food. They know how to do it. Joey! Pack your own lunch. Yes, Dad. In a bit. You should get dressed. Brother, the kids are running late. Why are you still here? The kids will be late for school. They won't. Sari, can you take care of the electric bill? I used up all my money for your sister's ultrasound. - I hope it's not too much trouble. - It's all right, brother. Thank you. Mom, can you pay the electric bill? Abby will get off late from school. OK, I'll do it... before heading to Laguna. Laguna? Why are you going to Laguna? Are you going to visit Marian? Why are you going to Laguna? It's Jerry. Won't his wife mind that you're visiting your boyfriend? Jerry passed away. He was buried last week. Buried? Are you dead? Can you lend me 500 pesos? For my fare? Don't worry. - I'll pay you back once I get to France... - I'm not asking you to. Even so. I owe you and your siblings too much. - Just 500 pesos. - You should visit my father's grave too. Have it cleaned and bring him flowers. Bring the kids too if you like. It might make him happy. I'll go ahead. Thank you. This is just a small project. Yes, I agree, this is small time. But if we impress Mr. Almonte's tailor, I'm sure he'll give us the 100 million-peso project in Palawan. And that's big time, dude! That's a weird strategy. You have a weird client. Who takes business advice from his tailor? Brian, there's one thing I learned from working for Liberty Telecom. How long has Mr. Almonte been a client? I made his first suit in 1973. I was just a cutter then. My father was his father's tailor. My wife and I renewed our vows ten years ago. It was held in Mr. Almonte's hotel. He paid for everything. Robert is a kind man. Emil! - Emil! - You said your female cutter was good! The measurements are off! This is so loose! Sir, if I make it any tighter, you'll look like a sausage. And I can't allow that. I want you to do this, not your amateur cutter. Sari. You've done that twice. Checking me out from head to foot. When a woman looks at me that way, she usually wants to undress me. You? What's the first thing you'd take off me? Your pants. Yes. So I could fix them. The cut is not right. It gives you big thighs. Makes you look shorter. OK. I spent a whole week trying to guess your name. Wanna grab a coffee? Because I want to have a coffee with you. I remember you told me I can't always get what I want. No. Fine. Brian and I are on our way back. - You can't always get... - I get what I want. Because I want it. I really do. Dude! Emergency meeting at the office. Chief is arriving in an hour. What? It will rain tomorrow. Tomorrow, I'll get what I want. A prayer? For what? For us to meet again? I want that. Rain! Come on! You look happy. You have a new girlfriend? I know you. When you're in love you can't put your phone down. She's not my girlfriend, Mom. Not yet. Does it have to be a national holiday for you to come see me? Mom, we were together just last week at the Stockholder's meeting. Yes, but you didn't stay long. And next time, Eric, OK, that you're next in line, not Alex Pineda. Is that why you wanted to see me today, Mom? Your dad wants to make you a deputy CEO. That's what you want, not what he wants. Eric... Why? Because I couldn't get along with your husband. Why can't you accept that I'm happy where I am now? We both know that if Henry were still alive... You're the only son I have left. Master Emil is not yet here. Olga, Sir JD's here. - Where's Sari? - Sorry, sir. It's Thursday. So... Sari's day off is on Thursdays. Where is she? It's loose? Where? Where can I find her? Give me a goodbye kiss. Have a safe trip to Hong Kong. Sari! What took you so long? I was reading. Really. Did you finish the book? - Not yet. - Why not? It's difficult to understand. - What's so difficult about it? - Do I really have to read it? Rico... he told me you'd improved a lot. You could already open your own tailoring shop. I can't. If you can't do it on your own, No. No need. - I'll lend it to you. - I told you no. Why are you always refusing my help? Because you've given me and my family so much already. I can't leave Master Emil. That's why I wanted you to read that book. So you could lose that third-world attitude! - You're getting mad again. - I'm not mad. Don't be mad. I cooked your favorite fish stew... And paella! Did you marinate the cod fish? Yes, overnight. I wouldn't want you to scold me again. You got me. How did the stock thing go? But you have another son, right? - What's his name again? - You mean Eric? Complicated. We don't really get along. But he's still your son. That's a good book. Do you know that? You really don't have a boyfriend? I don't. But someone's interested. I want to meet him. Let's size him up. No need. I turned him down. Right away? Why? There was a very big age gap. It's the same for us. Well? How old is he anyway? Eight. It's Mamon. But seriously, if you want to entertain suitors, make sure they're not senior citizens like me. Why do you always say that? Let's go to bed. - Where's mom? - Sir, she's downstairs. JUANCHO DIEGO Right? Such a heavenly name. But that slut will burn in hell! Why don't you just end it? So you'll stop hurting. Even when I made a mistake... My head hurts. God. Why can't he forgive me, Eric? Why? SHARP SUITS CLASSIC TAILORING TECHNIQUES That came with hot coffee and a really sweet smile. "Sari. Because you want it, and because I want to give it to you. Girl, if he courts you, say yes right away! But you said you didn't need me. After all, I can never be as good him. When he was still alive, When he died, you wanted me to die with him. I need a deputy CEO, OK? Me, lead your company? I don't have any talent for business! You're so arrogant. You're turning your back on the family and the company that fed and sent you to school What do you want? You want me to get down on my knees and beg you to come back? Where are you? The shop's closing at eight. Master Emil and Sari are waiting for you. Pull me out of the project. Bri, I have to go back to Liberty Telecom. When you get back to your family business, But right now, you're still the architect of this project. I hope that one day I can go to Saville Row. The world's best master cutters work there. Where is that place? In the UK. - Save up for your fare, Mamon. - Take Sari out on a date there. I'm really serious about you, Ms. Sari. Mamon... Don't you like me? What's your type then? Someone old. - JD. - As old as you? If you want a suit made, please go downstairs. No, Mamon. He's JD. He's the architect who will renovate this building. Oh, it's you. You're the one who gave this book and the cold coffee? Mamon Cruz. Are you really named Mamon? Are you really named JD? What does JD mean? It's a shortcut of my father's name. Shortcut? JD? Junior Daddy? How about you? Where did your name come from? Ramonsito. I'm also my dad's junior. There you go. Your abs are really full! Do your homework. I hope the architect courts Sari. I hope so too, so she can stop being with that old man. There you go again. That's just gossip. Sari's not that kind of woman. Gossip? It's been going on for five years and you're still in denial? Oh come on. I'm sorry. What time did your boss leave? Around four. - Sorry I'm not good at explaining... - No, it's OK. I just want to know how you use this space. The flow of traffic. Well, our customers stay here most of the time. They usually make small talk first before they tell us what they want. The senior citizens, most especially. - They're looking for someone to listen... - Senior citizens? So, you always entertain older men? Yes. Most of our clients are older gentlemen. Old and rich? Yes, many of them. After they tell us the design that they want for their suit, they choose the fabric. Here are the swatches. Here are the fabrics. - You have many elderly suitors? - What? I suppose the patterns are made here. Yes, but before making a pattern, we have to take measurements. Let's go to the fitting room. Are you OK? You seem upset. Is there a problem? In our shop, we take measurements privately. Many clients are embarrassed when other people know their measurements. In here, whatever you don't like about yourself is just between you and your master cutter. So how do you do your job? Would you like a demonstration? You? OK, I'll just get my things. Isn't this job for men? Women cutters are rare. My father was a tailor. I grew up exposed to this. Does he work here? He used to. He was Master Emil's favorite. I was 14 years old when he died. He got run over. - That's why you're close with Master Emil. - Yes. Master Emil? He treated me like his own child. His wife treated me like their child as well. I learned everything I know from him. From him, and another man who saw my potential. He trusted me to cut and sew his suit. That was my first suit as a master cutter. Who was this man? I'll measure the inseam now. Should I go on? Measuring that? You know? There's this dinner I need to go to. JD! Thanks for the book and the coffee! You want me to get down on my knees and beg you to come back? The kind that doesn't want you for a father! Leave your mistress then! Isn't adultery a big enough insult to your wife? Now you're leaving your mistress money? Have you no shame? - Careful with your words. - I don't care! I'm just telling the truth! Who's your mistress anyway? She is Rosario Alfonso. Sari. She makes my suits and she's a decent woman. She knows the meaning of gratitude and loyalty to family. Now I know why you can't do it. Wow... Of all the women... So the architect wants a suit made? Do well. I will. Leave it there. Thank you. OK, sir. This costs much less than what you plan to leave your mistress. Who is the artist? Juancho Diego? It's an Imao. You cheated on me first. And you haven't stopped cheating on me since then, while I did it only once. Just once. But you loved him. Perfect fit! It's different when you do it, Master. The droop is smooth! By the way, I need a new barong. I'm attending a wedding in Tuguegarao. The Regional Director of Tourism there? Yes. She asked about you. I think this is better. Sir, we can elevate this by point three meters. OK. Very good. We can start here... The engineer is inside. Take a look at these. - Leave us, please. - All right, sir. How long will all the repairs take? It will take three-to-four months. Is that so? That long? OK, I'll think about renting a place while you renovate this. Architect, since you're here, why don't you try your suit on? Sari...? What? That's what they call female master cutters. I read that in the book I gave you. Why aren't you here on Thursdays? - It's my day off. - Day off? - I can't. - Do you have a boyfriend? Will someone get mad if we go out tomorrow? So what's the problem? Why can't I get what I want? What? Grandma's missing? Did you call Mrs. Peching? Call her! Do I have to tell you everything? Call me when you find her! Oh my God... Stop the train! Wait! Stop! Grandma! Stop the train! - Grandma! - Stop. Grandma! Grandma. Grandma! You scared me! - You had me worried! - I was waiting for Mario! The war is over! Grandma! Don't run off like that! - Your crush also has a crush on you! - That's so cheesy! Kids, stop pestering JD. I hope they're not annoying you. - Sorry. - Uncle JD, look at my dress. Wow, that's pretty. - Is he your boyfriend? - No. Stop crying, baby. Come with me, Uncle JD. I'll show you my dress. Is he courting you? Does he like you? I won't get married, Mom. - Let me! - Wait. Here's what we should do. Ask Aunt Sari who should perform first. Go! - Aunt Sari... pick me! - What is it? OK, let's do this... Eenie meenie miney mo! Who will be the first to go? - Me! - Yes, you! You ended up staying late. The kids were quite a handful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about earlier. That was borderline harassment. Thank you for your help. Thank you. That was nothing. You really love your Grandma. So much. She raised us while my mom worked abroad. She took care of us when my father died. My mother never came back for us. She ran away with her co-worker in France. Grandma raised us all on a public school teacher's meager salary. We all finished high school. I'd love to go out with you tomorrow. But I already promised my Thursdays to someone else. I owe him my grandmother's life. He's forcing you to pay your debt? He never asked me to pay him back. So when he asked for my Thursdays, I gave them freely. Is he married? Yes. It's a shame, JD... You found out about this even before we could have coffee. Hurry! You'll be late for school. Watch your step! Hurry up! You're running late! - Get in now, hurry! - Take care. - Hurry! - Good morning. Are you sure you're free today? I am. You must be so curious about my Thursdays. But I'm surprised you said yes. I'm just as surprised. Perhaps after last night... I just felt so tired, having this secret life. I have been a liar for five years, JD. Yesterday was the first time I wasn't afraid to be honest. With you. Come in. Rico was the first client who trusted me with his suit. Sit down. You've been together for five years? Yes. Yes. We've been here for two years. We stayed in a condo in Roxas Boulevard before. I didn't like it there. You know, lots of people. No. He bought this for us. Have you asked for the title? I already have a place to live in. I don't need another house. Two years ago his eldest son died. He didn't want to go home because he couldn't cry with his wife. His other son went abroad. He was angry at him. He felt alone. He needed someone to mourn with him. And I was there. You know about his family? Not really. We only talk about them when he wants to. I can't ask. That's one of the rules. Is that the kind of relationship you have? Interesting. Why does it sound awful when you say it? Like something's wrong. But I don't feel that way. - Rico is kind to me. - And he's smart. First, he tied you down to a debt of gratitude. Then he imprisoned you in his loneliness. Rico is a good man, JD. Dude, you're a masochist. I thought you wanted to be away from her. I have to save her, dude. Her life will be wasted on that man. And with you, it's going to be different? JD, don't tell me you just want to free her from your dad. You want her to love you. You want her to choose you instead. Dude! You're just going to get hurt. Back out while you still can. You again? You're the king of bad timing. We're about to close... - OK. - Forgive my son, Architect. He's really a joker. Brian's gone. You're still here? It's raining! The taxi's here. Let's avoid the traffic. We'll go ahead, Architect. - Bye! Let's go. - Take care! You look like models for a toothpaste. Your smiles are priceless. Thank you. I will court you. JD, you know that... There's a Mr. Thursday. So what if there's a Mr. Thursday? And then... there'll be one Thursday... that you will miss me. And you will say to yourself, "I wish JD could be my Mr. Everyday." You're cornier than Mamon. Let's go out tomorrow. Sorry, I can't. I can't take you out, right? Then let's have our date here. In fact, I brought food for everyone. Since we have a lot of chaperones on this date. You've got competition, Mamon. This tastes better and is more nutritious. I won first place, Ms. Sari. You're so cute in your barong shirt! - Oh, my goodness! - Just wait! We'll beat you. If we win, we'll take everything you have. Sure! But if we win... you'll kiss me. No way! Are you crazy? Why would I do that? Grandma, the game is over. We won. No! All right. Fine! You will kiss me? I said all right! Game! - OK! - Kiss! - I said OK! - OK. Are you implying I'm fat? Please don't act like you own the shop! - We'll be in trouble! - I don't care! He can't treat Sari that way! Tell Emil. Tell him... Hey! What is your problem? - You pig face! - That's enough! - Do you want water? - No! - Coffee? You want coffee? - Coffee? - Hey, don't run. - Girls! Don't rush. Be careful! Best coffee in the world. Yeah right. It's just instant coffee. You've had three cups already. That's enough. Let's go. Hey, give me that. Don't litter. Let's go home. The kids have homework. You talk as if we're already married. Married? You wish! Seven hours... I still have seven hours until Thursday. What? What? You know what I can do... that your Mr. Thursday can't? I can marry you, Sari. And you won't have to share me with anyone. But you will have to share me... with him, with her, with all of them who depend on me. I will not leave them the way our mom just left us. So, do you still want to marry me? You'll have a lot to consider. A lot to worry about. You've just given me more reasons to love you. Let's pretend this ring is real. Of course, it can't be real. Come on. This will be good. Imagine us married. We live in a house that I designed... It would have to be a big house. - We'd all have to fit in there. - Of course. Grandma will have her own room on the ground floor. I like that. She won't have to use the stairs. And the two of us, we'll be on the second floor. No, four kids. Four? Four kids? - What? - OK, let's make it five. Five? That's too many! Can we really afford to send five kids to school? I'll take care of that, don't worry. Just close your eyes. Wearing my favorite suit which you made for me. You will not let me leave the house until you've kissed me and told me... And that is not pretend. I just want you to know... that I love you. Sir, this is for the field floor, Is this all right? Yes, dude. Let's keep it neutral. - How are you? - I'm good. Sari? You called? Is this the Thursday I've been waiting for? What? The Thursday when you'll finally tell me you want me to be Mr. Everyday. No. I just wanted to ask when you'll go to the shop. So, you miss me. Your suit is finished. When will you pick it up? So you won't miss me too much. Tomorrow. All right. Bye. Bro. So... how's your suitor? Relentless. Remember, you're his first love. He could get hurt. I doubt it. I think JD has had several girlfriends. JD? I thought Mamon was your only admirer. And who is this JD? How long has he been courting you? Do you like him? Can I like him? Let me know when he becomes your boyfriend. Sari? Dine out? Why? Rico, that's a Monday, not a Thursday. Sari. I still have a client. Sari... I told you... I'm just making sure it fits you perfectly. Why so serious? Did Mr. Thursday ruin your day? Have you eaten? Let's have dinner. This will just ruin our day. And besides, I'm better company. We can have dinner in peace. I want you to leave me alone. Because I want this. I want you. You can't always get what you want. If you want it, you can get it. If you want it, you'll find a way. If you don't, you find a way out. I can't do this anymore. What's your excuse? Yes. Five years. For five years, what I have with Rico seemed enough. I never complained. I never asked for more. I'd already accepted my fate. Then you came. I started to question. Sari... You'll never know what's missing until someone comes along who shows you. I won't leave Rico. Why? Why can't you leave him? Please leave... If it's money, Sari, I have money too. You know where I live. You know where I work. - Do I look like I'm after his money? - Fine! I don't care about his money! And I don't care if you have money! If it's not money, then what? Is that it? If I say yes, will you leave me alone? This isn't right! We shouldn't be talking about this. And what you're doing with him? Is that right? JD, stop it! Please. Your debt of gratitude? Is that it? You'll spend the rest of your life repaying his twisted kindness? I can't hurt him! So you're OK with that? You'll be a mistress all your life? No woman ever dreams of becoming a mistress! I love him! And he loves me! Is that love? You're a secret! You're deprived of his time! You don't have all of him! Enough, JD. That hurts. Fuck! You're hurt? What did you think? That I wanted this? I'm like a dog who follows you around begging for scraps. I'm going crazy every Thursday knowing you're with another man. And when people look at you, sometimes, it's all they see. You're this... And worse, even you believe that about yourself, and that's all you see. You forget that you're a good person. You forget that you deserve to be loved. You forget that you're free. And that you can change your life, Sari. That's what I want you to see. That's what I want to give you. Elsie, the fruits. Here they are, ma'am. Hey, leave that to them. - Are you OK? Are you comfortable? - Yes. I can convince your son to work in the company again. OK? All right. And where will you go? Rico, you know very well I can't just leave. I already talked to Emil. You told Master Emil? That Emil doesn't know? What about my family? What reason will I give them? Rico... - Ana told me that's the trend. - She could have asked me first. Maybe we can start with cream of... I'm assuming that's what you are, child, right? Your secretary still has poor taste! You're drunk again. Don't get your hopes up. - Stop it! You're embarrassing. - I'm embarrassing? - You're are! You and your mistress! - Mom, come on! Sari. Sari! Sari! Sari, stop it! Sari, what the...? Isn't this what you want? You're a better lover than your father, aren't you? You're better than him, right? Sari. This is what you want, right? Sari, that's enough! Stop. I'm not a whore, JD. I already set a meeting with Master Emil on Tuesday so we can present the plans. She still won't talk to me. You actually think she will? I've been your regular client. Where is Emil? He brought his wife to the hospital. What happened? There was a mistake in the swatches attached to the order slip. I specifically stated jusi or jusi piña for the barong. This is so cheap! I'm a wedding sponsor, not a security guard! I will make a new one. The wedding's tomorrow, right? I'm heading to the airport right now for my flight! I will personally deliver your barong to Tuguegarao tomorrow morning. Fine! Since you want to be a smart-ass. - Bri. - You're here again? You don't give up, do you? Who knows? She might talk to me now. - OK. Maybe you could help them. - What's the problem? I packed you a change of clothes. When will you be back? Right after I deliver this to Mr. Zarate. Don't forget Grandma's medication, Abby. - It's nearly ten. - I can't get a cab! - It's late. - Sari, I already told... Sari, I already told him... You're going to Tuguegarao? Want me to drive you there? - Sari, it's 9:45 p.m. You'll miss the bus! - Just listen to us. There aren't any taxis! Where's a cab when you need one? I can drive you to the bus station. No! Bring her to Tuguegarao! Sari, if you can't get a cab, you'll miss the bus! Ms. Sari, why not take JD's offer? If you don't get there in time, Mr. Zarate will be angry with you. If you want to eat, You might get hungry. Even before I knew the truth I already liked you. When I learned who you were in Rico Torres' life... It's crazy. But I couldn't. I wanted to see what he saw in you. What you saw in him. Until I wanted you to see me instead. There are many reasons why I shouldn't love you... but only one reason why I can't do that. I love you. That's it. Will the parents and godparents approach the altar... to give Ivy and Jerome their blessing. Where is the reception? Are you really an architect? Why does Brian call you JD? The name of my real father. Mom accidentally told me when she got so drunk. She tells me the same stories. The funny thing is, she doesn't remember telling them when she's sober. I don't ask about it. To make her suffer telling the truth. When I learned about it, everything made sense. It's the reason why I felt Dad seemed to love only my brother, Henry. Your dad loves you. He'll be heartbroken if he finds out... you'd rather be known as another man's son. That's why we can't be together. What if JD was my real name? What if Rico Torres wasn't my father? What if nothing had happened between the two of you? Let's pretend, Sari, that everything was right in the world. What do you see? What's wrong? Let's go. - What did you see? - Nothing. Let's go. - Sari, what did you... - Let's go. We're here Let's help them achieve that. Let these lanterns take away their fears, their worries, their doubts, and all the reasons that hinder them from being happy. Let us send the lanterns to the skies. Wow, they're so beautiful! You asked me to pretend. Can it be real? If you want it to be. I'm afraid to believe. So beautiful! You want me to go with you? No. I have to talk to him myself. I love you. Go home. I'll just call you. I've been calling your cell phone. Emil told me the wedding was yesterday. Why did you arrive just now? Were you with your suitor? Yes. Eric. Eric? I met him as JD. But Eric Torres is his real name. Rico, forgive me. Rico, please. What right have you, Sari? You're just my mistress. Eric? Get out! Get out of the car! Get out! - Rico! - Get out! Rico! JD! My God! JD! - You bastard! - That's enough, Rico. - You knew, didn't you? You knew all along! - Please stop. - I told you! - Stop. That's enough, Rico. Rico, please... Rico? Rico, what's wrong? JD, help me! Rico! Oh my God! He had a lot of blocked vessels. Tell me the truth. He's in critical condition, Regina. There were many complications. His kidneys were affected so his creatinine levels have gone up. You knew, Eric. You knew everything. She is your father's mistress. JD, how is he? The doctor said he's in critical condition. JD, I'd like to... Can I see him? Can I see him even just for a while, please? I understand. Yes, it's ready for pickup. May I know who you are, ma'am? That the father of Architect Torres was Frederico Torres? -Ma'am, let's talk outside please- -Why, are you ashamed? Where was your shame when you went out with both my husband and son? Ma'am, I beg you... I just have one thing to say. Stay away from my family. Even a moron should understand that. What right do we have to judge? I, least of all. It was my fault that you... No, Mom. This is all my fault. This is my life. I knew what I was getting myself into. Even if I tell myself that I am a good person, that this is my only sin, it's still wrong. I allowed myself to fall in love when I knew I would hurt other people. It just hurts, Mom. It hurts so much. Grandma, I'm sorry. Sari is a bad girl. Just stand in the corner, my child. Accept your punishment. Rico? You want me to call the doctor? Stay here. I've hurt you over and over again. So I won't hurt you anymore. If I will live again, I will look for you. Your dad is looking for you. Tomorrow, Alex is going to... I can't. for the people who depend... on the company, and for their families. You have to do it. I'm sorry, my son. I should be the one to apologize. I don't know... where to start. I don't know how to explain... In my life, I fell in love twice. That's why I understand you. You really are my son. And then... you smiled at me. That's why I gave you my name. He asked to be buried in his favorite suit. That's the first suit I made for him. Did you ask him to forgive me? Thank you. - His other things are upstairs. - Sari... I don't need anything in this house. The cab is here. I love you so much, Sari. I love you so much. Maybe... it's only in a make-believe world that we can love each other. No. No. JD, please. And I would like to believe that But I guess I will never measure up to him. Mamon, have you finished your homework? Yes, Ms. Sari! You're my only unfinished business. - You're so cute! - You can court her once you grow a waist! - But Sari's heart belongs to someone else. - Bye, Sari. Sari, I've already talked to Atty. Mona to iron out the details of our new business venture. Thank you. - Anytime. I'll go ahead. - Take care. Sari, I'll go head. Do you need any help? - No, I'm fine. - Bye. Take care. What if JD was my real name? What if Rico Torres wasn't my father? Let's pretend, Sari. That everything is right in the world. What do you see?
