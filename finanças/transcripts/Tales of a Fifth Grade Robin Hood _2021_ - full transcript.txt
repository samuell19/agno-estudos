[alarm rings] Yes! Now... Oh! There he is! Morning, buddy! Oh, you're ready. Here, I got you some of this. Mind if I have breakfast with you? Here you go. Whoa! Slow down, tiger! Slow down! What's the rush? Can't. Fundraiser's ending today. Last day already? That's for Principal Richards, yeah? That was last week. This is for new books, gym gear, better lunches, pretty much everything. Oh, wow. Robin, I'm really proud of you for trying to make your school a better place. You know, as a CPA... before my firm went under, I just... look, I just don't want you to be shocked if the money doesn't go where you want it to go. Yeah, but this is different. -Why is that? -Because it's me. All right, whatever you say, kid. Oh, hey, my second job has me working nights this week. So I need you to come home straight after school. Go out and party all night? Gotcha. Very funny, mister. No, I need you home safe and sound before I head to work. What if I get attacked by giant nuclear lizards or aliens land and try to take over the city? Wow, that is a... that's actually a really good point. Well, in that case, then you call me. Calling me and telling me you're in trouble is way better than me calling you and discovering that you're in trouble, got it? Fine. I'll be back the second the last bell rings. Excellent. I got your favorite TV dinners, the ones with the brownies! Cool! Thanks, Dad! Of course. See you later! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgetting something? Oh, come on, come on! But that's not what I'm talking about, huh? Oh, man, what kind of books you got in here? Just important ones. Yeah? All right. -Love you. -Love you, too. Hey, remember, right after school, okay? Got it. Don't go fishing! Come straight home! Hey, Joe. Good to see you again! Hey, my friend! How are you? I got you a sandwich. Oh, no, no, Robin. I couldn't take it. I'll just grab something at school, Joe. It's a BLT, your favorite. Don't mention it, Joe. Everyone needs a little help sometimes. Thanks, kid. You're welcome. Have a great day! Mmm. Okay, John, it's the last day of the school fundraiser. Let's prove to Robin we can raise the money by ourselves. Let's do it for Principal Richards! -We have to watch out for Wolfe! -Git! Git on, git! You mean the worst security guard ever! Okay, people, it's time to open your hearts and your piggy banks! My friend John would love to take your money! For a good cause! Every penny will go to helping us! Don't you guys want a better school? I'm running out of ideas. Cake every day? We need Robin. You're late. We've got everything set up. We would've started, but no one would listen. Follow my lead. Just do it fast! Vice Principal Prince will be here soon. May I have your attention, please? I need everyone over by this side. I've got something you won't want to miss. [laughing] Sadly, our fundraiser is coming to a close. We hoped to raise another $100 to make sure we can get books, better lunches... and we only have a short time to do it before VP Prince shuts us down! We've got to take care of our school while Principal Richards is out sick! But what if we had something to enjoy right now? I think if we raise, say, $200, we can see our favorite teacher, Ms. Tuck, get pied in the face! I'd like to see that! John, show 'em what's behind the curtain! [cheering] Hello, students! [laughing] Pie! Pie! Thank you, thanks. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you! Oh! That was close! [laughing] Thank you, thanks. Thank you very much. [engine roars] Prince. Croc! Snake! [honks] Get rid of that sign! Prince Only! Get rid of the fine. -You got it. -Ridiculous. -Get rid of that curb! -Of course! Where's my briefcase? Oh, you could do better than that! Oh! That was close! Hi, Johnston! Yes, I'm picking up the funds now. All right. All right, I'll see you at noon. Who else got one? You got a pie? Oh, come on! I skipped breakfast for this! He's coming! Here, let me get this done before Prince shuts us down. Out of the way! Out of the way! Move, the great me is coming. [gasping] [screaming] [shouting] Tuck! Will you get yourself cleaned up before you go back to class? You look like a fool! Come on! Let's get you cleaned up! Not one step! I'm calling everyone of your parents! Well, at least we reached our goal? I can't wait for Principal Richards to be back. I would have thrown a curve ball. No, a curve pie? Either way would have gone right around him. I threw it perfectly, at least until Prince got in the way. I did! Where's instant replay when you need it? Move it! Get going! Walk it off! No running! [bell rings] [clamoring] Whoa! Is that our volcano? Oh, I didn't know you guys worked on it. We're going to do the presentation! I've got my sound effects ready! [makes explosion noises] They're amazing! All right, settle down, class! Shh, shh, shh. We have a lot to do today and not a lot of time to do it. Now before presentations, we're going to test the viscosity of liquids with the many marbles of my prized collection. But first, how to make kid-friendly elephant toothpaste... [P.A. system feedback] Good morning. This is Vice Principal Prince speaking. How are you? Awww... I'm fine, thank you. I have tallied up the total raised by the 5th grade fundraiser. And it comes to as very unimpressive $653, all of which will go to Principal Richards's medical expenses. We wish him well. Oh, FYI, until he returns, I've been authorized to be the acting principal. Yuck... Do you hear me? Acting! Principal! Oh, that's amazing! Is that true? No, but they don't know that. [laughing] That's good. Stop it! Ms. Tuck, Mr. Richards told us last week that we had already raised all the money needed for his medical bills. It is a role I humbly accept, along with my campaign for School Board President. Remember, kids, tell your parents, "For Your Student Kingdom, elect a real Prince." Ms. Tuck, he stole our fundraiser money! Robin, you're gonna need a lot of evidence for an accusation like that. Today we're starting a new program called "Open Concept Learning". Wolfe, grab everything. Everything? Everything! When you say everything, you mean... Yes, everything. Everything. All right. Well, all right, let's do... Not me, you idiot! -Out there! -Okay! -Well... -Stop it! Get out! Out there, not in here! Outside! [feedback] That concludes today's announcements. Do not intervene! Intervene? That's just... We'll be taking books, we'll be taking desks. What is the meaning of this? We'll be taking anything not nailed down to allow students to learn in a free-range environment. Thank you for your cooperation. [feedback] Wait, you can't take my desk! My marbles... Wait! No, no, no, no, no! I'm scheduled to be here for eight hours. You got that kind of time? All right, hand it all over. No! What about the chili? That, too. That's my life's work! It's all I have! It's boss's orders! No! -All right, all right! -It completes me! [feedback] What are you doing? Stop! Stop! You can't do this! Stop! No, no, no, no. You've gotta get through me! John, it's fine. It's not worth you getting into trouble. Just let him through. [kids clamoring] -No! -No! -Stop! -Stop! I'm sorry, excuse me! Don't touch the children! Stop! That's mine! Give it! Okay, just talk to vice principal... [feedback] [foghorn] Cut your tomatoes and get outta here! I'm taking this with me! No! Leave the chili! All right, okay, hand it over, hand over the chili! All right, okay. All right. Oh, wow. I'll miss you, Bernice! Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot! Kids, I'm so sorry! Oh! One, two, three... Enough! Hey, give it back! Give it back! All right, let's gather round on the floor for now and... Just right here. It's fine. Just make a circle, we'll just gather round for now. Yes, it's great. Turn your books to page 42. We don't have our books. Oh, right. Maybe I can pull the book up on my phone and we could just pass it around. How are we supposed to learn under all these conditions? Mmm... Ms. Tuck? This is bad. This is exactly what our money was supposed to go towards! I'm sure once you find Prince and you tell him where the money was supposed to go, he'll fix it. Oh, wait. All of the hall passes were in my desk. So you're just gonna have wait until lunch to go find him. One last thing, students. I know you've all been complaining about how bad the lunch is here, so I have some good news! Now you can all get real burgers, fries and whatever else your heart desires! Yay! I got rid of our entire lunch program and worked out a deal with the fine folks at the mall food court down the road. What? Tell them Princey sent you, and get 3% off. Vote Prince! In other words, I'm canceling lunch! He can't cancel lunch! I need lunch! I'm a growing boy! I can't afford mall food! We have to do something! [buzzer sounds] We have to get those desks back! My legs are killing me! He's up to something. We can't let him see us or we'll be in big trouble. I'll be lookout. Again... Thank you. I'll use my special call if there's trouble. [squawks] What was that? [squawks] [snoring] That's our fundraiser money! [clattering] Hide! Johnston! Good to see you. -You as well. -Have a seat. Now... Fundraisers... it's from the kids. It's only $653. So it's just a little bonus. He's giving our money away! We have to get in there. No! We need evidence! What are you doing? Robin, don't! -He'll see it! -No, he won't! It went under his chair! Doesn't she have a kid going to art school next year? Well, that can't be cheap. Nice shot! Maria, I'm Robin Hoode! Okay, look! I don't care what your excuse is! But you need a hall pass or it's an automatic suspension! Okay, but what about Principal Richards? Do we have to worry about him? Well, not if you elect me School Board President tomorrow at three p.m. 'Cause if you don't, come Monday, Richards is back. That'll be it. Well, we can't have that, can we? No. Hey! Aren't you supposed to be at lunch right now? Don't you know you need nutrition for your growing brains? You know, I eat all the time which is why my brains is bigger than your brains! Yeah, uh... [squawks] That a bobcat in the hallway? That sounds sick. Guys, come on! Wolfe's on the way! Next time if you hear me scream, hide! What is it, Wolfe? I thought now might be a good time to talk about that super secret plan-- Shh! Let's go somewhere where we can talk more privately. Oh, like the super secret executive lounge-- Whoa! What'd you see? Nothing. But... We just saw them go in there. Either of you know how to pick a lock? Hmm... What do you think? That was a very impressive super secret executive lounge. The candles were a very nice touch. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Yeah, you really are quite a class act. Have you tried these in the super secret entrance through the library? 'Cause that thing is awesome! Looking forward to seeing you Saturday. Three p.m. sharp. I look forward to it as well. So, uh... what you got going on now? You wanna do anything? Get a sandwich or something? Just go do whatever it is you do. All right. Aye-aye, captain! Hey! No running in the hallway! That is a felony! [bell rings] Prince's office is always locked. We can never get in. Wolfe said something about a super secret entrance inside the library. I need to get my phone back! It has evidence of Prince using our money! Meet me in the parking lot after school. Bring the volcano. Okay. Everybody know the plan? Break. Wait for my signal. Yes, ma'am. Don't call me ma'am. I'm 10. -Yes, ma'am. -Mm-kay. Oh, hey, Mr. Prince. Can I talk to you? Acting Principal Prince! I was just wondering why, you know, you have to cut so much of the budget when we've done so much fundraising? Good question, but it's not budget cuts. It's "Open Concept Learning". I'm trying to foster... You're one of Ms. Tuck's fundraising kids, aren't you? Guilty! Lots of things that go into a budget that you would never understand. Because you're 10 and I'm an adult. Now, If you'll excuse me... Acting Principal Prince, wait! Wait for what? Wait here! Wait, please! Just wait! No! I'm going to my car! Have a nice day, dear. I hope you don't. I'll see you tomorrow. [crunching] [rumbling] No! Our volcano! -Are you kidding me? -How dare you? How dare I what? Why would you leave this behind my car? You've ruined our volcano! It fell out of my backpack! I... It's my car, not yours! Why are you crying about it? It's $5,000. I hope your parents have insurance! This is gonna be at least three weeks in the shop [sobbing] Stop crying, relax! Calm down! I'll make sure you get a "C"! Um... 3, 2, 1... He said it fell out of his backpack! Excuse me? You kids are a bunch of zeroes. Zero, zero, zero. Hey, Mr. Prince! We need to get going! Yes! You have to tell Ms. Tuck we're getting an extension or else! What? You can always build another volcano! You're gonna get detention. Oh, no! What did you do to our volcano? Me? Come on, guys. And don't worry, sir. Ms. Tuck will understand this is your fault. My fault? It slipped out of his backpack! It's all your fault! Your fault! You heard it! It's all your fault! Stop! Know this... I have had my eyes on the three of you from the beginning of the year. Ever since you filled that classroom up with soap suds... Had to get those floors clean. And the room full of marbles? We needed something that could easily be grouped into ones and tens. Common core, 'ya know. Oh, tell me about it... enough! Now I know where you live and I know where your parents work! You're walking a very thin line. Do you understand? Principal Richards may have liked you, but I don't! Darn it, the audio is bad. You can't make anything out. My volcano was ruined for nothing? Come on. We raised so much to save our school! Now we need to save it a different way... By stopping Prince. [sighing] But how do we do that? We come to school tomorrow. On a Saturday? Man, my dad's gonna kill me! I know, but nobody will be around. We get in, get into Prince's office, find the money as evidence and use that to stop him from getting elected. We just need to stop him before the election at three p.m. tomorrow. Wait. What time is it? Almost four. Robin? See you tomorrow? Yep, tomorrow! Uh, okay. At least the color's still nice. Thanks. The flies like it too. Where were you? Sorry, dad, I... Uh-uh. No, no. No excuses. Did I not say you to come home right after school? You did, but there... And it is not not right after school? No, it's not. Okay, so here's what's gonna happen. I'm now late for work, which means you're in some big trouble. But there's this guy who stole all the fundraiser money. Yeah, what did I say about excuses? Robin, you're grounded. What? Go to your room, go to your room. You can't do that! You're gonna be in there for the weekend, all right? -But-- -Hey, listen. You keep it up, you're gonna be there the whole year. I have to go to work. Be back after midnight. Just be in there when I get back. Okay. Go. Maria? Robin? What's wrong? I got grounded. But it's up to us to save the school! We need you! I know. I lost track of time. What about tomorrow? Tomorrow? Or else Prince will win the election and we'll never stop him! Robin, I know your Dad would understand. Are we really gonna call this off? No, the plan's still on. But I'll need your help breaking me out of here. We have a school to save. [alarm rings] Son! I'm trying to sleep! [snoring] Maria? The goose has nested! I repeat, the goose has nested! Copy that. We are a go! Oh, come on! Stop it! [clattering] [knocks] Hey, Robin? [doorbell rings] [chattering] Oh, hi, Mr. Hoode, sir. Um, can Robin come out and play today? I'm afraid not. He is very grounded. Bye. But it's such a nice day out! All right, so he's grounded the whole weekend. You'll just have to wait 'til Monday, right? Bye. -Please? -Please? -Please? -Please, please? -Come on, man! Please? -Come on! -Please, please, please? -Please, please, please! -Come on! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Pretty please. -Please! -Please. -Please. -Please. -Please. [Robin squawks] -Please. -Please. Oh, never mind. -You know what, it's fine. -Bye. See you... whenever. -Bye. -Thank you. Bye. Thank you. That was close! We have to go. Hey, kids? -Yes, sir? -Yes, sir? You the ones that helped robin with the fundraising? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Did it go well? -No, sir. -No, sir. Well, I hope it gets better. -Yeah, us, too. -Yeah, us, too. Yeah. -Yeah, bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. I thought I was gonna poop my pants. Yeah, it was close. Let's get out of here. Hey, Joe, I got you a doughnut, your favorite. Well, thank you, Robin. I'm off to save our school. Bye, Joe! Take it easy! Bye! Go get 'em, kids! Chocolate glazed! Woo! All right, guys. We only have a few hours to find the money, prove Prince stole it and save our school. -No pressure. -No pressure. Wait. So, what? We just walk in and go straight for the office? Yeah. With all the budget cutbacks, they probably don't have any security on the weekends. ♪ If you like it you should have called me back ♪ ♪ But you never did ♪ Oh, yeah Hey! What in the heck? You have absolutely no right to be here, okay? Unless, of course, you got a school pass! Oh, yeah, we had ours, but we forgot them. You have any spares for us just to see if we have the right ones? It's so hard to keep track. Oh, yeah, I got a school pass. You wanna see it? It's gotta be fast. Yep. That's what ours looks like. We'll be right back with passes. Who cares? Get outta here! So they can afford that guy, but we can't have lunch? Cool. What was all that about? I thought we don't have Saturday passes. Not yet, but I'm always prepared. Everyone grab the blue ones. You're doing it wrong. What? [laughing] Can I... help you... Here you are, sir. Our Saturday passes. Now, if you'll excuse us... Ah, but, but, but, but, but... Yeah, it's the wrong one. It's supposed to be red. Why'd you show us the blue one then? Because I don't have any red ones, okay? They keep 'em in a lockbox inside because we got budget cuts going on in this school! It's a nightmare in there! Come on! Get outta here! Go on home! Come on! Goodbye! -So now what? -Got any more ideas? Guess drama got cut too. We're here to fix your pipes. We went pipeless! Whole school, no pipes! Aliens have crash-landed. Oh, that'd explain the damage to my car. Get outta here! We came here for a dance battle, boy! [hip hop music plays] Yeah, that's next week. [record scratch] Someone's appendix broke in there! We gotta help! Hey, hold up, okay? This school is not zoned for surgeries. All right, now get outta here, Doogie Howser! Who's Doogie Howser? I think he's that kid that moved to Texas last year. If we can't get past him, we need to get him away from the door. Robin, does that pie booth have wheels? 'Cause I have an idea. What the... "Dear Wolfe, here's the prize for my favorite security guard. "Just stick your head through, close your yes and count to 10?" Favorite security guard? Oh, okay. Well, let's just see here. Oh... Okay, here we go! One... two... three, four... I'm doing it! I'm the best and I'm doing it! What are you doing in there? You know, just stretching. I think my vest is stuck! Hey, Croc, go find those kids. They're up to something. You gonna help us? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. Do you have a psychiatrist? John, you run distraction! We'll go to the principal's office! Me? Ha! Hey, knuckleheads... Come get me! I'm coming, guys! [slowed-down shout] [slowed-down] No! Safe... Okay! There has to be another way in his office somewhere! Robin, look! All this stuff they stole is here. [panting] -What are we gonna do now? -I don't know! There's a door around front, but it's probably locked! Don't worry! I have the keys! Oh, man... -You should go first! -You should go first! I will go first because I'm the bravest! I think I found the back door to Prince's office! What makes you say that? Oh, makes sense. It's locked. Maybe there's a key or something over here. I found a key! Go see if it works. Doesn't work. Someone paid a ton of money for an addition to the school. That's a lot of overtime. What happened to the budget cuts? It's dated only a couple of weeks before Principal Richards left. Can we use that as evidence? Not unless we can prove that this is our fundraiser money. Let's see what else we can find. I thought you said the election was at one? Oh, did I? My mistake. It's at three. But now that you're here, I'd love to talk about it. I don't know. You're running for President of the School Board. That just seems icky. Well, why don't we talk about it over lunch, say, McAllister's Prime Rib? -Hmm... -My treat. Oh, in that case, all right. [whispers] Yes! Oh, well, well, well! Good to see you there, punk! Hey, Wolfe, you hungry? I mean, I can always eat. Then eat this! [shouting] Ha! I'll go find John, hopefully he lost them! I'll be right behind you. I just need to check something out real quick. Whoa! Come on, John, in here! Robin! Where'd you go? Robin, you can't just leave us like that! We could have used your help! I know, and I'm sorry. But you guys gotta see this! Whoa... Just wait 'til you see the next room. Welcome to the new executive lounge! Whoa! What is this place? I dunno, but it's time to party! Let's go look for that fundraiser money. I'll check Prince's office. I actually know a great dry cleaner that can get out chili. He's right next to Ramichi's House of Waffles. Well, that's pretty good. Down on 4th Street. Someone's coming. Maria, go jam the door! Looks like they found the super secret lounge! Nah, it's jammed! I jammed the door, but it's not gonna hold 'em off for that long! I have an idea! Here we go! Here we-- [grunts] Oh, my... Okay, here... Okay, there's something wrong with this door! It should pop right-- You guys wanna help me with this? No? All right, fine! Here we go! [slowed down shouting] Ah! Okay, I'm fine. Go on without me! Okay... -Come on, kids! -You come on out! -Three... -It's time! Two... Give it up! -One! -One! All right... [shouting] Cover me! Why do I have to stay behind? Because Robin said so. Oh, no! All the balls are gone! We got him! Don't worry. Your friends will be joining you soon enough. Oh, congratulations. You defeated a kid. A real annoying kid, too! They don't just give these to anyone! Okay, that hurts. You and Snake go. I'll make sure this one doesn't get up to anything. I don't think John can hold them off for that long. We have to find a way into Prince's office! They're probably in here! You hear that? Someone's coming! Hide! Whoa! Ha! Aww. I would have thought I would have at least scared one of them! Ha! See? Nothing! There's literally no one here! Take a look at this office here. Oh, no, not that office! That office only has one key and I'm the only one who has it! Got it right here. He calls me sometimes in the morning and says, "Hey, can you use your keys to let me in?" I go, "I don't have to be in for another two hours!" You know, it's the worst job! It's rude. It's... I've tried... anyway, come on. Let's go. Let's go find 'em. Come on! No time to waste! Let's get inside! Come on! It's not working. Watch an expert do it. You're welcome. Let's find that money and save our school! All right, the money has to be in here. Look for someplace secure. Somewhere only Prince could get to. Well, this is a place to start. PRINCE: Yes, I was thinking that same thing. Someone's coming! Hide! You know, Mrs. Cross, I am so happy you decided to vote Prince for School Board President. You'll be able to send your kid to art school for life. Please, no. [laughing] Let me get you those funds. No looking. I still don't know, Prince. Well, just think of it as a gift. If you decide not to vote for me, you keep it anyway. -Are you sure? -Absolutely! Come on. I'll show you where we're gonna build the new gym. That was too close! Do you know how to break into a safe? If we use the chemicals from our volcano project, set them off against the safe's mechanism, and force of the reaction causes the safe to break, which would open it! Let's try. Now I just left Cross at the gym. Here are the keys to Ms. Tuck's room. Get baking soda, vinegar... Go! I'll figure it out, and good luck. Cross at the gym. Now the next thing we need to do-- Bye! What? Get her! She went that way! Search all the rooms! She could be anywhere! She can't be that far. Maybe she turned invisible! I wouldn't put anything past these kids! Shut up and search the rooms! Can't have an explosion without a volcano. Hey! TP Prince! Over here! Wolfe, you go that way! Hey, guys! Come and get me! Why are you doing this? You took our desks and canceled lunch! So what? You didn't need 'em. Maybe, but you're still pretty bad. Hey! Look, boss! I got her! Get off of me! I came around from the side, boss! I got her! Take her to the other room with the other kids. Oh, I will. Oh, I'm doing it, all right! Here we go! Help. Ow! I'd better stay with Croc. Make sure these brats don't escape. Sounds good to me! Let us out of here! We have rights! [speaks foreign language] Not in there... [speaks foreign language] -Hey. -Hey. At least Robin's still out there. Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. Okay, science, let's see what happens. Before you know it, I will be School Board President and Principal Richards will be history. [chuckles] What are you doing here? You can't go through with this! Oh, I can and I will. I won't let you. I'll set off my volcano! Ooh, a volcano. So scary. This isn't a regular volcano. Oh, really? What is it? Your worst nightmare. Hey! [explosion] The election is starting in 10 minutes. We have to get out of here and stop it. But we're stuck. What would Robin do? Besides leave me behind? He only does that because he trusts you. No. It's because I'm a star athlete at the school. Either way, feeling sorry for yourself is not going to help us. What would Robin do? Wolfe! Get in here? I can't find my phone! Wolfe! Yay! Foam party! Nice. So what's going on in here? That brat set off an actual volcano! Now we have 10 minutes to get to the School Board election. So... Where did you get an ice cream? I always have ice cream. All right, get the safe to the gym and help me find my phone! The whole safe? That seems a little impractical. You're impractical! Hurry up! Quit playing with the foam! Now get that safe to the gym and find my phone and hurry up! Put a little on top. [knocking] Knock, knock, can I come in? Okay, hey, I know you're mad at me and I get it. But I have here your favorite PB&J cut diagonally just the way you like it, with chips, huh? Robin, you interested? Look, kiddo, I'm really sorry I got so mad at you, It's just... I worry, you know. I was a lot like you in school. You know, I had big dreams, a big personality. It's just... school dragged everything out of me. Every time something good would happen, something bad would happen. I didn't want to get your hopes up because I know how quickly things can come crashing down. But I've come to realize that I shouldn't rob you of your hope and optimism based off my experience. Because that might not be yours. You should be allowed to believe in whatever it is you want to believe in. And if it happens to be this school and your fundraising can help rescue it, then who am I to take that away from you, right, son? Son? Right, son? Son, hey... Robin! PRINCE: Ladies and gentlemen of the school board committee, please make your way down to the auditorium and get ready to vote for your new school board president. Robin? Hey, come out! Oh, man! You're gonna be so grounded, man! Hmm. Hmm, just in time. Soon nobody will be able to stop me from taking over this school... and the district. [laughing] Stop it! Come on! Set me down. It's too small to fit into anyway. Prince is President. We have to get outta here, but we're stuck. Do you have any ideas? You're the idea person anyway. Why do I always have to be the idea person? It's always, "Maria, could you build the volcano, I'll give the presentation?" Then it's "Could you just give the presentation, too? You know volcanos so much better than we do." It's so annoying. At least you're valued for your brain. People look at me and think, "Hey, he's strong and fast. He can do all the strong and fast things." I got other skills. I'm taking Algebra 2 at the high school first period on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Oh, I had no idea. You never asked. That's why you're always late? Not that that matters, now that we won't have a school. But, like, do you have any ideas? No. And here he is, Prince! Thank you, Don Pardo. Right. Is that thing on? What? No. I mean, it's supposed to be. We'll just say there is something wrong with the upload. Fine, but where's the money? Right there in my safe. Give me a second, I've got to get the... Okay, all right. We're good. It's a little heavier-- I got it! Gonna be fine. [groaning] Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I've already advanced you $653. But I am in a particularly generous mood today. So after I am voted School Board President, you'll each receive an additional $5,000. I just need to see what's inside the safe. I thought we agreed to $100,000? Well, yes, it'll be $100,000 after we pilfer the other school districts. Did you find the last one? Uh, the last one what? Shh! The kid! Oh, yeah... no. Well, go find him! Okay. Let's start the election. The 113th Nottingham District School Board Meeting is now in session. [humming] [police sirens sound] Hey, the police are here! Good. You hear that, kids? You'll be in a different cell soon. [laughing] Oh, no. Wait. Hey. Hey! It's not that funny. All right. All those in favor of making Prince the President of the School Board, say "Aye". Aye. Cross, how do you vote? Think about it, Cross. McAllister's Prime Rib every single night. Aye. Well, congratulations, School Board President Prince. Thank you, thank you. I can't believe I won. By a landslide. -Really? -Yes! Shall we do a recount? Thank you, thank you. [banging] What do you want? We really have to go pee! No, you don't. Yes, we do! Real bad! Just take a second. They're bluffing. The second we open the door, they'll try to run off. Okay, well, if you don't let us go, then we'll just have to go on the floor. I dare you. Okay. Don't say we didn't warn you. Oh! Oh, come on, man! That's gross! Okay, okay! I'm opening the door! [screaming] [speaking foreign language] [laughing] Hey! Hey! You open this door right now! You hear me? One of these keys can open up this door. You know what the messed up thing is? What? I really do have to pee! Great. Once you take the money, I'll have all the evidence I need. Almost there! Come on! Can you reach? I'm trying to get leverage, but-- -You gotta reach! -This isn't working! I'm gonna lean back for the leverage. -Stop moving your face! -Keep reaching! I know! All right, you better have a good answer. You don't even know. Come on. Pick up. [phone rings] No, no, no, no! What is that? Dad... Robin! Robin! Robin! I can't talk right now. I have a sandwich. I'm here holding your favorite sandwich! Please! Keep it down! No! You don't get to keep-- Robin, what's going on? Everything's fine. Just tell me what's going on. I'm sorry I ran away, but I'm at school. Why are you at school? Some bad people are trying to take over the-- Aha! I got him! Robin, stay on the phone! Hey, are you okay? Let go of me! I got the last one, boss! I got the last one! Robin Hoode. They got Robin! We have to get him out of the there! How do we do that and keep everyone else inside? -I have an idea! -I have an idea! Well, well, well, if it isn't the leader of our merry little band. You can't get away with this! I heard everything! Mr. Richards will be back and you'll have nothing. Hello, Mr. Hoode. This is Acting Principal Prince. Your son has been caught vandalizing school property. He'll be arrested and expelled. Have a good day. [laughing] Shut up! This the vandal? This is the miscreant. There's two other troublemakers in the hallway. We didn't vandalize anything! What about my office? There was a volcanic explosion. I can explain. What's going on here with all of this? Just a public school board meeting. Oh, aren't those supposed to be public? Yes. There's a camera over there. Well, it doesn't appear to be plugged in. What? Didn't I tell you to plug it in? You told me a lot of things! And that was probably one of 'em. Officer, they're lying! He's been stealing-- We'll get your statement after we get downtown. Let's go. Stop! You're arresting the wrong person! He's the one you want! Those are the other two troublemakers. Ah! [screaming] Get him! I don't take orders from you. Do you take bribes? Ooh. We've got a runner. Let me go! Get him! It's so dirty under here! Hurry up! Ah! Guys! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! You guys saved me! We're not done yet. Help us with these desks! Perfect! Now let's block off the whole hallway! [shouting] Get them! It's locked, boss! Try the other door! Ah! Not that one, the other one! Nice job with the desks, guys. Robin, we need to talk to you about the way you treat me and John. What? You guys are my best friends. Doesn't feel like it. There they are! Get them! Can we talk about this later? We've got bigger problems. Okay. One more thing. [grunts] Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on! Hey, look! Hey, what's that sound? Marbles! Normally, I don't accept messages from parents. But Charles Hoode sent me a video with some very serious allegations about our new principal. It's all stemming from this video that his son uploaded, you know, on the cloud. All right, guys. We're almost home free. We just need to get to the exit! Stop right there! Nice try. There's more than one exit. There's no exit for you. Let's not make this any harder than it needs to be. You kids already have a long rap sheet. Well, looks like this is our last stand. Robin, do you have any ideas? We just have to hope I can find my phone. Oh, you mean this? Sorry, kids. I am going to be school principal and school board President. And there's nothing you can do to stop it! Not so fast! Principal Richards! What are you doing out of bed? Unhand those children, officer! There are the ones you want! Not so fast! You're all under arrest. I had nothing to do with this. I'm just saying. I don't even know how I got here. We have you on video taking bribes. Is that what I look like? You have no hard evidence. Look in his safe! You'll find the missing money. Yes, look in the safe. Oh, no, I forgot the combination. Zero, zero, zero, zero. John Prince, you're under arrest. For what? Name one thing! Misappropriation of funds, bribing a police officer, harassment, embezzlement, impersonation of an elected official, fraud, evading the police, obstruction of justice, child endangerment, loitering, jaywalking, 27 unpaid parking tickets and a hazardous level of cologne in an enclosed space. Oh, please. Ridiculous. Hey, buddy? How about some change to help-- Get a job. Ah! [clamoring] Jail is gonna be fun! If I can get a hotplate, I'll make you pancakes! Will you shut up? My heroes! I really wanna thank you kids for saving our school. If it weren't for you three, things would have gotten really, really bad. In fact, I'd like to appoint you as members of the Student Ambassadors to the school board. Thank you, sir! -Yeah, thanks. -Thank you so much. Sometimes all anyone needs is a little help. And the gratitude to thank those who helped him. Hey, Maria, I'm sorry I rely on you so much. Having you come up with ideas and do all the bookwork, it's not fair. We all should do our fair share. And I think I've been getting by too much lately. It definitely won't happen in the future. Thanks. That means a lot. And, John, you're really smart. I'm going to listen to a lot more of your ideas. What you did with the marbles? Amazing. You're way more than just an athlete. Appreciate that. Really. Robin! See, what happened was... See, what happens was you tricked me, hmm? You ran away. You almost got yourself hurt and arrested in this huge mess. Sound about right? Yes. And you fought for what you believed in even though you knew it was hard. You know what? I'm proud of you, kid. Good job. So does that mean I'm not-- No, no, no. You're definitely still grounded. But that doesn't mean that we can't get ice cream after school, right? Can my friends come too? Well, these are the two criminals that helped you escape. Sure, why not? Yay! But just one scoop. Aw... Okay, two scoops. Yay! I ain't made of money. Come on. Mr. Hoode? It's come to my attention we may have some new openings on our school board. If I remember correctly, you have experience handling money, correct? Yes. As a matter of fact, I am a CPA. Oh, perfect! We'll need one this coming Monday. See you then! Thank you, sir. [bell rings] All right, welcome back, welcome back! I missed you guys! Give me a high-five, somebody! There you go, there you go. Looking good, Joe. Hey, good to see you. You ready for school? You excited? Hey, it's so good to have you back, Mr. Richards. Thank you, thank you. Hi, Ms. Tuck. I'm Robin's father. Nice to meet you. Thank you for all... for all you do. Yeah, for sure. We should get coffee or something. That'd be great. Welcome to your first day as the board's new CPA. So let's get you settled in. Yes, excited. So, listen, Robin. Have a wonderful day. If I'm not mistaken, as of 12:01 a.m., you're officially ungrounded. You mean it? Thank you, dad! -All right. -Don't leave him hanging! You can invite your friends over after school. Just don't embarrass me. I won't. See you later! -He's a good one. -He's a good one. I really appreciate this opportunity. Good morning, class! I don't have rubber bands! Well, I was just looking for my last missing marble, but let's start with roll call. Or we could start with cake. What are you guys up-- As newly-appointed members of the School Board-- We would like to congratulate Ms. Tuck on becoming the interim School Board President. [applause] Guys, you are so sweet, but, you know, part of your job as Student Ambassadors to the School Board, it's ensuring that all the money fundraised goes exactly to where it's needed most. And this cake, delicious as it may be, might be a waste of money. Don't worry, Ms. Tuck. We made it ourselves. Oh, in that case, everybody have a slice of cake! [cheering] [screaming] Uh, you guys okay? What happened? I thought I lost my marbles.
