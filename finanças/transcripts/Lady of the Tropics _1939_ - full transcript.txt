Well, here we are. It's good to see old Saigon again. I hope your Saigon will be better than Manila. They call it the jungle in the silk hat. As for me, I'm sick of elephants and awfully sick of people with bare feet. The next time someone asks me to sail round the world I'm going to shoot them. You did that because you were losing. - I did no such thing. Hello. Hello. Here comes Father Antoine. He'll show us everything there is to see. He knows Indochina like the palm of his hand. Mr Hype. See if my daughter and Mr Carey have filled in their landing cards. Aye, sir. Pardon me. Miss Harrison, you father asks if your landing cards are ready. We're just finishing. - Thank you. Bill, what is my occupation? That's easy. 'Heiress', of course. The real problem is, what is mine? - Hmm. Playboy. No. They'd expect me to arrive with some blondes and a polo pony on my arm. One more little item here: 'Married or single'? Don't you know? I'll put: 'Prospects fair'. Only fair? No big rush about it. I still got $500 in traveller's checks. Careful. You'll have me marrying you for your money. Well, let's get going. - Oh dear. More sightseeing. Baedeker there called Saigon the Paris of Indochina. Every one of these places is always the Paris of something or other. Who knows what may be awaiting us? Adventure. Romance. Anything. Anything? Just what are you looking for, Bill? My cigarettes. This is Mrs Hazlitt. And my sister, the Countess Berichi. How do you do, Father. - Here you are. Father Antoine, meet my daughter. - How do you do. This is Mr Bill Carey. - Glad to know you, Father. Father, you haven't changed in twenty years. We change slowly in the orient. If at all. Byvin. [ Vietnamese language ] I feel this doesn't speak very well for the work we do for the native children. Do not judge him too harshly. He wanted it for his mother. Is he a native boy? I would have sworn he was French. No, my child. Not quite. His father is French. His mother a native. I adore half-casts. They're so vicious and fascinating. No. They are not vicious. Somehow they remind me of .. Well, flying fish. Very harmless. Born to the water, they spend half their lives trying to soar above it. Only to fall back again into the sea and die there. Do the whites accept these half-casts? - No. They only create them. Shall we go ashore? - By all means. Come on, Byvin. Father, we've looked forward to seeing your Paris jungle. I'm sure you'll find it most interesting. Take a quick look, Dolly, before the town is ruined by the tourists. Get out, mademoiselle. No. I will not get out. - Get out, mademoiselle. You drive me where I am. - I drive you no place. Get out. Let me go. A jolly little town for girls. They allow the natives to treat French women like that? She isn't quite French either. I see. One of your flying fish? Father, isn't there a local aquarium where we can see more of them? I don't know you would like it. - We would adore it. Wouldn't we, Bill? I should have taken a poke at that guy. A delicious place, Father. It seems to be safe enough for a baby of four. Terribly charming and respectable as far as the eye can see. The eye is not the best judge of morals. The people are very nice but the grouping is a little improper. No Frenchman is ever seen here with his wife. Romance? A hideaway. Well. American man. I see you're apart. Good evening, Father Antoine. - Pierre. Whose little husband is that? - Pierre Delaroch. One of the richest men in Saigon and very powerful. An official? - No. An influencer. Not for the best I take it. I'm afraid not. William. Don't look. I'll say one thing for him. He has good taste. Good taste often goes with evil. But I should not say that. Mr Delaroch is a very charming and interesting man. Who's the lady? She's one of the flying fish. Really? I'd love to meet her. Father, invite her to the table. Waiter, some more chairs please. And don't you start waving your fins at her. Mr Delaroch I should like you to meet some of my friends. Permit me. Mr Harrison. An American sponsor. - How do you do. How do you do, Mr Harrison. It is seldom Saigon is so honoured. I doubt that tourists are ever an honour, sir. Mr Delaroch, this is my daughter. My sister, the countess Berichi. Mrs Hazlitt. Mr Howard. Mr Martin and Mr Carey. How do you do. And this is Mademoiselle Manon DeVargnes. How do you do. Manon DeVargnes, join us. Sit down. Thank you, father. You're very kind. I was here many years ago. And I am surprised at how little everything has changed. Yes, Mr Harrison. The orient does not believe in changing life quite so much as enjoying it. How interesting. We've been hearing the most fascinating things about you. I am dying to go shopping in Saigon. I adore shopping in strange places. Do you buy your clothes in Saigon, Mademoiselle ..? DeVargnes. Yes, of course. Thank you, Bill. DeVargnes. My dress is from Paris. You look gorgeous in it, my dear. You need not defend it. Nix. Monsieur Delaroch is terribly enticing, don't you think? Have you known him a long time? No. Not very long. Orientals are really the most fun. I knew one once who was head of a cult. Care to dance, mademoiselle? - Thank you. You will excuse us, darling. Don't get your feet wet, honey-boy. How long ago were you in Paris? I've never been. I thought you said you did your shopping there. No, Monsieur. - Oh. Have you lived in Saigon long? No. It must be a very interesting town. I suppose there's lots of things about Saigon .. And Indochina that tourists never get a chance to see. Yes, Monsieur. Well. I guess you've had enough. But I like to dance. Well. Here we go again. You dance very well incidentally. Thank you. 10-1 you're a dancer. Professional, I mean. I was. That's very interesting. Musical comedy? - No. Ballet? - No. I don't want to seem too prying but I would like to settle this one point. Mind telling me where you danced? No, Monsieur. Where? - In a temple. I never danced with a priestess before. A priestess? Thank you, Monsieur. - Thank you. It has been most enjoyable meeting you. We see you tomorrow at the commandant's palace. I cannot be there but I'll try to have the dancers perform for you. Wonderful. I am mad about native dancing. It will be a pleasure arranging it. Goodnight. Mademoiselle. Thank you. Goodnight. - Night. Well? What's new? - What's that you're drinking? I'm waiting to hear about the flying fish. Nothing to tell. She stayed underwater. He was very amusing. The American. You are jealous? We had an ancestor who wrote. 'My heart floats on your smile'. Your heart is very light. - Manon. If you could say to me: 'Pierre, I love you'. There's nothing I own you couldn't have, dear. Nothing. There's nothing you own that I want, Pierre. Only your health. Still dreaming about going to Paris? - Yes. It's very difficult, Manon, to get you a passport. Not for you, Pierre. It's easy for you. If I get you one. You'll not run away from me? - No. But I will feel free. Someday, when you're tired of me. Then I will go. Manon, you lie like a beggar. It's the truth. The truth? My dear. The truth is not in you. You have the face of the West. But your soul is full of eastern smoke. I know you, because I am like you. We both belong to that non-race with two heads. You dream that a passport will remove one of them by magic. And leave you French. Completely French. Stop dreaming, Manon. You won't get me a passport as you promised. I did not promise. I merely wanted to see you smile. Manon. Yes? What is it? - Excuse me. The commandant asked me to find you. He wishes to know if you will honour him with your company this evening. Tell the commandant I am honoured. Yes, sir. Are you angry? No. In a few days I will have stopped thinking about the passport. Marvelous. They would be a sensation at the World's Fair. If you will pardon me, I will call the commandant. Pardon, Monsieur. We have the dancers with us. And the Americans? - Also. We are twice blessed. I'll be right out. Mademoiselle, it is useless to ask any further. You have no-one abroad. Your father's family seem unaware of your existence. And apparently wish to remain so. But. So I simply must refuse you a visa. Now, pardon me. I must go. Monsieur. I do not need anybody. I will be able to live in France as a French woman. Come, come. You can be French in Saigon. - No. I can only wear clothes from Paris and pretend I belong there. I'm sorry, mademoiselle. We feel you are better off in Saigon. Excuse me please. - But Monsieur. Monsieur Commandant. - No, mademoiselle. It's not our policy to send half-native children out into the world unprotected. I'm sure, my dear, you will in the end .. Be happier among your own kind. My own kind. Bill, those hats. Aren't they wonderful? Not much different from most of your hats. We are very grateful. Is there anything we can get them? - No, Monsieur. Unlike us, they have everything they want. Bill, I want one of those hats. Okay. We go shopping. Tomorrow. We can't go shopping tomorrow. We leave in the morning. Alright. I'll see if I can buy one from one of the dancers. Hello. I am afraid they won't sell their hats. They won't sell their hats? That's ridiculous. Why not? They love them very much. They're supposed to be little temples. Their gods are meant to live inside them. What gods? Two or three hundred different ones. But I know where you can buy one in a shop. That's wonderful. You're very sweet. Will you give Mr Carey the address? 11 Rue de Monargue. 11 Rue de Monargue. Miss Harrison. Mr Carey. We are all invited to Mr Delaroch's home for tea. Monsieur Delaroch? Wonderful. I would love it. Run along before the stores close. Bye, mademoiselle. - Goodbye. See you on the boat, you hat maniac. Are you joining us? - No thank you. I must go home. Bon voyage. - Thank you. How you doing, lady? I want to bay a dancer's hat. You know, like a .. Like a pagoda. Buy? A dancer's hat. Hat. Hat? A female dancer's .. hat. You know, a dancer. Watch. They. They wear them in temples. Temples, savvy? Temple? Temple. Temple. Chapeau. Temple. Temple. Big? Big? Big or small. I don't care. Trot it out here. Do you like this? No. I do not want. I don't want him. I want to buy a hat. You understand? A hat. [ Vietnamese language ] That's what I was looking for. She will wrap it for you. Thanks. I was having a little trouble. I thought you would. So I came to help. A good thing you did. I'd have been here all night. What happened to the party? They're having tea with the commandant. Don't you like tea? I wasn't asked to have any. I thought Delaroch was a friend of yours. Yes. But. Not at tea time. She says she hates to sell it because it's so beautiful. Too bad. How much to console her? Very little. Let me, Monsieur. I'll pay her for the hat, the paper. And a little profit. We can go now, Monsieur. What's she hollering about? - She thinks she's been robbed. How much was it? This is a gift to the mademoiselle from me. I won't let you do it. It's silly. How much was it? Please. Alright. Here, I'll carry it. It is not nice for a man to carry bundles. It strikes me you know a very peculiar type of man. There is only one type in Saigon. Such as? Very respectable and very lonely. Do you do a lot of cheering up? No. You treat 'em cruel, huh? Cruel? What you laughing about? What can a woman do to a man that is cruel? I can think of a few things. Not in Saigon. In Saigon women are not important enough to be cruel. Goodbye. Where are you going? Nowhere. - Just going, eh? Tell me, have you got anything in particular to do nowhere? Nothing. Nothing that matters. You see, it's my last evening in Saigon. It would be nice to spend it with .. Somebody nice. If you have time? I got all night. I am glad. We'll you go and see my cousin Nina at the caf?? I have to say goodbye to her. Anyone else? No. Only Nina. You do not mind native food? All I mind is not having dinner with you. After leaving college, there I was. Flatter than a pancake. Only one accomplishment. How to spend money. But you didn't have any. It was all gone. That was the drawback. No money. No brains. That's how I became a house guest. - Whose guest did you become? Anybody's. Anybody's with a swimming pool and a tennis court. And a d?butante laying around loose. That is a very sad story, Monsieur. There is Nina. Each time you say goodbye. I die a little. Each time you say goodbye. I cry a little. Is that your cousin? - Yes. No words of mine can tell .. This pain I feel. Only your eyes have encouraged me to try. A little. She sings very well, don't you think? Beautifully. Poor Nina. - Why 'poor Nina'? She has a baby. I see. No husband, huh? - Yes. She was married. He was a very nice but .. He had to go back to Paris. And he didn't take poor Nina with him. - No. You see. Nina is not .. entirely French. And when the gentlemen go back to France. They scratch out the marriage in the register. Just like this. And you are free to get married again. Nina has been married quite often. We forever. Say. Goodbye. When do you leave Saigon? - Tomorrow. Where are you going? Where? I am going .. I am going home. - Where is that? I'm going there on a river ship. Far? Very far. Manon, you are here. Monsieur, I did not sing good tonight. I am so unhappy. My baby is angry. Louis is drunk. Louis is my friend, Monsieur. And Manon is going away. My heart is broken, Monsieur. Monsieur Bill Carey - Mademoiselle Nina. How do you do. You are not long in Saigon? - Arrived yesterday. He is helping me to say goodbye to Saigon. How sweet. That is nice of Monsieur. Evening, Manon. Good evening, Monsieur. - Hello. Won't you sit down and have a drink? No drink, thank you. Mr Delaroch, the manager will be so proud you are here. Only for a moment. I was on my way to the governor's house. He is entertaining tonight. I was told that you were here, Manon. I stopped by for a moment. Glad to see you. Have one? - No thank you. I met your friends. They wondered where you were. The. Young lady was quite upset. - Sorry if anyone suffered over me. I thought I'd do some sightseeing on my own. It's a lovely town. Looked at from the right angle. Yes. It's too bad, isn't it .. That have no more time to get better acquainted with it. Yes. A shame. When are you leaving, Manon? I? - Yes. Leaving where? - Saigon. But I am not leaving. No? - No. I heard at the hotel that you had given up your room. That? Yes. I left because it's too expensive. I am going to stay with Nina. Here. Yes, Monsieur. That is true. I shall see you tomorrow then? Yes. At Nina's? Yes. Thank you. If you care to come with me to the commandant's party .. I'm sure you'll find many interesting types there. Sounds wonderful. But one can't see everything in a few hours. A tourist is very handicapped, isn't he. Yes. - Yes. If you come to New York, look me up. I'll show you some interesting types there. Thank you. Tomorrow then? Of course. - At seven? Yes. - Thank you. Goodnight. Very good. But who were you fooling about going away? Me or him? Why should I fool you? I see. One fools only one's friends. If one does not like them. - Or if they like one too much. No, Monsieur. One must always be polite to Mr Delaroch. He is very important and if you do something he doesn't like .. boom! A local Frankenstein. We'd better get out before the bogeyman comes back. Like to go now? - Where? I thought you'd like to say goodbye to Saigon in a rickshaw for a few hours. I can go along and help you be sad and wave to the buildings. That would be nice. Hard to find one at this time of night. - I'll find one alright. Don't run out on me. - No. I have my doubts about that. I'll be back. With a go-kart. Who is he, Manon? Is he rich? - No. But he is important. He can help you. You don't have to go away now. I thought maybe at first. But then .. He is a nobody. Only very sweet and very nice. My poor Manon. What a pity. Then you are going? - Yes. But Monsieur Delaroch, Manon. That would be better than to marry someone who lives in the jungle. Mr Kim Kahoum goes to Paris every few years and .. The government is very nice to him. They allow him to take along his wife. All of them? - No. Only those he prefers. He would take me. And then. When I am in Paris. I will run out of the hotel and down the street and around the corner. And hide myself forever. In a white world. Manon. You're so brave. Then I am going to marry a member of the chamber of deputies. And I will tell him I cannot be happy unless he sends for Nina. And he will send for you. I promise. Manon. There is Bill. Goodbye, Nina. Then you will be gone tomorrow? - Yes. Nina, you must promise me one thing. You must not marry anymore. After Louis, no more. He will be my last husband. After Louis I will remain a widow. I promise. Goodbye, my darling. - Goodbye, Manon. The night is sweeter when it is silent. Isn't it? Yes, sir. I've no complaints about this night. Except that it will be over a little too soon. Yes. In a little while. Sometimes. Sometimes people walk backwards through life. Looking at a single night. I'm going to look at this one a long time. What will you remember? That I met a lady with eyes like birds flying away. But I didn't even have sense to hold her hand. Please. Do not remember that. It would help a little if I knew something about you. A few details for the long winter nights. No. I think it's better like this. The less we know, the more we'll remember. Yeah. Maybe you're right. It won't make much difference after tomorrow. This is dock. Out now. Oh. Alright, how much? Thirty sou. That's all. Thirty sou. That's just for ordinary hours, isn't it? Here you are. - Twenty francs? Bill, that is too much. - Not for the nicest ride I ever had. There is a sky for you. Is it always like this in Saigon? No. Only tonight. You must be dead, fellow. Why not sit down for a while? Bill, I must go now. I've not packed my trunks yet. - Yes. But you must give him a rest. Besides, how do I get out there? Swim? Wait here. I will help you. Boy. It looks like they're all on my side. He is a robber. He wants ten francs. Five for the ride and five for being woke up. Too much. Tell him to go back to sleep. We let him to wake up by himself and save five francs. That should please you. How nice. - What? Your boat. Boats always look sad at night, don't they. Like the moon. They ride away like the moon. Getting up steam. It looks like it's goodbye. Thanks a lot. For everything. It is so nice. He says he's ready. Hold your horses, shorty. I got a little memorising to do. I'll always remember that moon under the heading of 'unfinished business'. Okay, shorty. You win. Goodbye, Saigon. - Goodbye. Your hat. You forgot your hat. Thanks, pal. You're a big help. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Forever. On a trip like this .. Oh, my hat. It's adorable. Try it on, darling. Letters too. - Marvelous. I haven't found Bill around anywhere. - Did you look behind the bar? He falls asleep there sometimes. What's the matter, darling? Bad news? Sort of. 'I hope the hat fits'. 'Forgive me for not waiting to see it on you'. 'But there are things in Saigon Baedeker never knew'. 'If I don't show up in Singapore'. 'Will you mail me the rest of my neckties'. 'Thanks for the ride and love to all'. 'Bill'. It's outrageous, jumping ship like this. - Come now, daddy. No tantrums. Bill is very nice. Much too nice to spend his life .. Cooped up on a yacht. With a lot of privileged zombies. Well. I got a hat out of it anyway. Grab this, will you. You are sailing, sir? - Yes. Where's the purser's office? - This way. Thanks. How do you do, sir. - Good day. I am looking for a Mademoiselle DeVargnes. DeVargnes? I do not think we have such a lady. DeVargnes? No. DuVarge, Dolittle. Not DeVargnes. That's kind-of funny. - Monsieur is distressed? A little bit. A young lady? - Yep. Beautiful? Yeah. That's right. Dark hair, big eyes. I will look. Your name, Monsieur? Carey. Excuse me. Manon. Manon. I am sorry. - That is okay. Good evening, Monsieur. Is there anything I can do to make you feel comfortable? Nothing, thank you. I understand how you feel, Monsieur. In my life too, there was a woman. A woman who loved another and left me waiting. I have never recovered. It was in Marseilles. - Monsieur LaFarge. Will you come here please? I am wanted. I will tell you the story tonight. I can't wait. It's turned out to be a lovely night, hasn't it. Bill. You remember me. - But I saw you going away. I detoured. I've been looking. Say, why aren't you on the passenger list? When I go home I use my native name. Kyara Kim. No more Manon? No. I left her in Saigon. You came on the boat for me? Bill. What's the matter? I stopped to buy a hat and I almost missed the boat. I beg your pardon, Monsieur. You have found consolation. You did not need me. No. Not at the moment. It's getting chilly. I'll get another blanket. - No. Don't go away. It only takes a minute. A minute is too long. Why? Because the trip is so short. Angkor Wat is not exactly the end of the world. It is. We are going to talk about that. Later. Yes. Later. What are you thinking? I'm wondering how I got here. You are sad? Getting sadder and sadder. It isn't like me. I am sad too. Manon. Yes? I have a feeling that I'm in love. You don't know? It's hard to tell as we're so far from New York. Is love different in New York than in Saigon? Oh yes. Yes. New York love is like a new suit. It cheers you up and makes you look pretty for a while. And. In Saigon? It is you in size. Let's walk for a while. First thing we do ashore is I cable Singapore to go on without me. I'll tell them I've got amnesia. It's true. I can't remember a thing about my past. What is all this? Looks like a reception committee. Must be an oriental potentate on board. It is for me. You don't say? So you're a princess, huh? I am going to be. What do you mean? They are servants of Kim Kahoum. They have come to meet me. We travel by elephant three days to his house. It's a very big house. He is very rich. Bill, I should have told you. He arranged with my mother to marry me. I see. So it's a wedding procession, huh? Which one of these snake charmers is the lucky man? You are angry? No. Not at all. Please. What should I do, jump up and down? Cheer and throw rice? - No. I would like you to understand. Nothing so very mysterious about it. It turns out I've been a sort-of bridal escort. It was arranged a long time ago. He gave money to my mother. That's why I have these nice clothes. I am sorry. I've been doing you an injustice. I thought Delaroch bought them for you. No. It was my dowry. He is very rich. - You've said that once. Here's one of the boys now. Looking for you. No hard feelings, Manon? It's a lot of fun being a bridal escort. Good luck in your gold house in the jungle. With rings on your fingers and bells on your toes. Goodbye. Don't remember me as too big a fool. I am honoured to welcome you in the name of our master Kim Kahoum. Who sends his greetings to you. He instructs me to entertain you at the temple tonight. And to rest until tomorrow. Our master will arrive in the morning. We are your slaves to command. Hello Fatima. I am on another detour. You must go away. I must talk to you as soon as this is over. I'll meet you up the stairs by the stone Buddha. I never wanted to see you again but you pulled me here with a 2-inch cable. Listen. I'm taking you out of this sideshow. No. I can't. - Why not? You're in love with this elephant owner? - No. Nothing. Then why? Because we who are born as I am, cannot have what we want. In Saigon I see the boats go away and my heart goes away on each one. And I stay behind. - I thought it was something like that. Now, listen. Stop arguing. You're coming with me. I want you, Manon. I want you for keeps. For keeps? Yeah. Kinda odd, isn't it? You go along hearing of love and think it's something that only happens to .. Lunatics and idiots. You wonder what the yelling is about. All of a sudden, you find out. You find out only once. Somebody you kiss just for fun turns into a load of dynamite. And blows you up. I have never been loved like that. Manon, will you marry me? You must not ask me because .. I want to. It's better if I go away. Better than being a wife for a little while and on the government register. You're not signing any government register. You stand before a priest. I'm not marrying Kyara, the Sultan's delight. I'm marrying Manon DeVargnes. We sail off together on the first boat that has a bridal suite. It is not true. You're being nice to me. It isn't true. You're coming with me as my wife. In the eyes of God and man .. The United States passport bureau. Yes, Coco. We'll go fishing. Manon. You have come back. When? - Just now. An hour ago on the boat. - He didn't want you? I'm sorry. Listen, you stupid Nina. I am happy. I've come back to be married. Married? The American. You remember? - Yes. Yes. Bill, Bill. This is for you. - For me? Put it on quick. You're the bridesmaid. - I'm going crazy. He is looking for the padre. - No. The padre? Yes. We're going marry in the mission in front of the altar. The mission? Then you'll get a passport and go to Paris. You have a hat for a bridesmaid? There may be one in the closet. - Alright. Now hurry. Will you go to America? - Yes. Do you love him, Manon? He's the nicest man in the world. The nicest. Who is it? Good day, Nina. Good day, Monsieur. Well, a new dress? Charming. Very charming. Thank you, Monsieur. - Tell me, Nina. Didn't you promise to let me know the moment you heard from Manon? But I didn't hear. Not a word. And I could not find out. But now you have found out. - Monsieur. I am not a magician, Nina. I merely heard you talking to someone who seems to have vanished. Not vanished, Monsieur. Only looking for something. Manon. Where have you been? I went to visit my mother. You said you were not going away. She was very sick. - I see. Is she better now? - Yes. That is good. And the American? The American? - Yes. You mean Monsieur Carey? He went away. I am very glad. How pretty you look. Nina. Please leave us for a few minutes. Yes, yes. - Thank you. Manon. I'm not a man who falls in love easily. Please believe that. When I became rich people eyed me in a way to say: 'How much have you got'? 'What can I get out of you'? Manon. You are very rich. You have paradise to trade. How much for that paradise? Everything. Everything I own. Don't you understand what I'm saying, dear? I'm asking you to marry me. Why don't you answer me? Manon, dear. It is better to marry me. Better than dreaming like a child of a world that you will never see. Never, Manon. Please answer me. Later. No. Now. Tomorrow? Manon, I shall not leave you until you answer me. Manon. Please. Say yes. Yes. You. You did say 'Yes'? Let me see. There are many things to be done. I must arrange everything. I will arrange it for tonight. I must notify myself. No. Tomorrow night will be better. More guests will come. Manon. I did not expect to be so happy today. She should be here. Something must have happened. Perhaps she won't come. What do you mean? Perhaps she may think it wrong of her to marry you. Mind if I smoke, Father? - No. You don't think it wrong for two people who love each other to marry? To marry decently and live happily for ever after. I only think, Monsieur, that you marry someone you love but do not know. And will never know. Manon comes from a race older than ours, Monsieur. A race whose heart is as inscrutable and mysterious as its .. Hats and its gods. You'll have only a half a bride, Monsieur. Eager and happy. The other half will always be far away from you. And I fear that when sometime, his hidden one is revealed to you. You will look with pain upon a stranger in your house. Wherever your house be. My house would always be empty without her, Father. But the east is not so inscrutable. It's bought a new hat for its bridesmaid. Darling. Manon, look. It's like a sailboat. Leave it alone. You might break it. I asked my Louis to come to the wedding dinner tonight. But he says he hates high society. He said it is very boring. [ Telephone ] You answer it, Nina. I am busy. Hello? Yes. One minute please. Manon. It is Delaroch. Where? - Downstairs. He says he is waiting for you. Hey, are you alright? Wonderful. All the hats are wonderful. Every one. Tell him I will be down. - She will be down. You miss me? Not at the moment, darling. I am busy. What will you do, Manon? I've got to get downstairs. Now look. The rules of this marriage are as follows. When I'm out of the room you're a widow. Weeping. Darling, when you are gone, I am a little widow in the forest. Waiting for the moon. - That's right. Now pine away. I'm going to dress. Manon. Wait here. Good evening, Monsieur. Is it true? You were married. At the mission. Yes. That is what I have been told but .. I doubted it. As I worked out that a snake has poison in its veins. You have done this to me. And you're not afraid? You have made a fool out of me. You lied to me. You look at me so calmly. I ask you to forgive me. I did not want your love. And I have lied for the last time. No, Manon. Not for the last time. You will lie as long as there is breath in you. Madame. Accept my congratulations. I shall always remember how sweet your lips were. And I shall wait for them. Patiently. You are very sure of yourself, Monsieur Delaroch. You own the world. But inside you are lonely. Where I go, you are nobody. Not even a name to be remembered. I doubt if you'll travel that far, madame. Father Antoine. You came to our party. I am so glad. Bill will be very happy. I am honoured to be here, Madame Carey. The missing bride. I was about to notify Scotland Yard. Evening, Father. Glad you could come. What's the idea of running out on me? But Bill, Father Antoine arrived. I called to you that I was going down to meet him. You did? Well, I didn't hear you. Shall we go? I hope you have an appetite for dinner, Father. Madame, Monsieur. One moment please. Pardon me. Permit me to offer my congratulations. Thank you. You are Mademoiselle DeVargnes, are you not? I was. I am married now. This is my husband. Monsieur Carey. How do you do. I recognised you. I knew your father very well. Very well. He used to come to my salon in Paris. A very brilliant man. Thank you. You resemble him, my child. Very much. Very much indeed. You are so kind, Madame. May you be as happy as he would have wished. Make her happy, Monsieur. She had a wonderful father. - I will obey your instructions, Madame. Bill, look. How sweet. From the hotel. With my compliments. - Thank you. We'll come back here to celebrate our golden wedding. With twenty new guests. Look, Monsieur. Neufch?teau '29. Neufch?teau? If you wish anything else, call me. - Very well. Thank you. I wish my Louis were here. You sail on the Marie Antoinette Tuesday? Right. The way I see it: a month in Paris. No, no. Two months. Okay. Two months. London for two months, then off home. Home? Where is that? Rainbow-land, honey. The good old USA. Here's to the both of you. You know she is partly native. It cannot possibly last. Very good, sir. I will send him at once. Mr Carey. Mr Gobinalle wishes to see you. Alone. Okay. Sit here and look at the pretty pictures while I go and cool off La Belle France. How do you do, sir. - How do you do, Monsieur. Sit down please. - No thanks. It's hot. I'm in a hurry. I came to see the commandant. - I am acting commandant. Major Gobinalle. The commandant sailed last night on a six-month leave in France. Good for him. I know there seems to be a little confusion in getting my wife a passport. I am sorry, Monsieur. There's nothing I can do about it. What? Can't you arrange this for us? Impossible, Monsieur. My hands are tied. Tied? I don't get it. All you do is put a stamp on a piece of paper and sign it. The commandant sent this from the ship last night before he sailed. See for yourself. 'Under no circumstance is Madam DeVargnes to be issued a passport'. Do you understand? She's married to me. She's married to an American. She's still a citizen of this country, sir. Those are the commandant's orders. I cannot go against them. I wish you weren't so nice about it. I'd like to tear this place apart. I am sorry, Monsieur. Good day, Major. - Good day, Monsieur. Is it over? He did not have it ready? - No. Not yet. He refused? Temporarily. - But why? I don't know. The commandant got some kind of brainstorm before sailing for France. He sent an order from the boat. Last night. Come on now. No moping. We have work to do. What can we do? Our first move will be to undermine the French government. Listen. How do you like this one? This goes to a man who used to be a pal of my father's. Editor of the Morning Herald. The kind of guy who can start or stop wars. 'Dear Leonard'. 'French government holding my wife captive. Won't issue passport'. 'I don't blame them. She being the nicest thing in the entire colony'. 'Insist on her rights as her husband is a hundred percent American'. 'Rely on you to bring civilization to this benighted land. Bill Carey'. Very good. He'll do something? - Certainly. Kings and queens quake before Leonard. Anything else? No. No use making the government too unhappy. Maybe you're right. Look. I want these to go as weekend letters. This one has to catch a boat. My name and address. Send the charge to my hotel. Very good, sir. You're not going to worry? - I am happy. Do you love me? - More every minute. I'm not so sure I like that. - Why? 'More every minute' could mean you didn't love me so much yesterday. Not as much as today. That makes today no good then. I got to wait for tomorrow. You want everything at once. I want you crazy with your knees shaking and glassy-eyed. Where you can't eat, sleep or think. Walking along half-dead with love like me. Look what's happening. - What? The rain. - I know. You were watching, huh? - How could I help it? It's raining on my hat. Now I know you love me. You let it rain on your hat without even hollering. You don't mind getting wet, huh? - No. Rain is lucky. Why is everybody running for cover? They're not in love. Look at it bounce. Like arrows. Look at my poor hat. Give it here. I'll dry it for you. That's nice of you. Now. Put it back on before you get wet. - Thank you. I will. Is that alright? - Much better. Manon. You are still in Saigon after all these months? Well, I am surprised. Not so surprised, Pierre. Oh. You haven't forgotten my name. That is very sweet of you. Thank you. Welcome to my house, my dear. I often thought of coming to see you but then .. I thought no. He would only laugh at me. No, Manon. I shall never laugh at you. Pierre. I have come here to ask you to forgive me. Forgive you? For what? You went to the commandant and told him lies about me. You spoke against me. Persuaded him not to let me go away even though I was married. He believed everything you said. I don't blame you. I didn't act nice to you. But now. You've had your revenge. You will help me? It's a great thing to ask but .. You are a big man, Pierre. Manon. You seem to think all you have to do is smile at a man and .. He will melt and fall at your feet. And forget what you are. Cruel. And deceitful. No. I am not like that. Yes. But you are. It is that Manon that I love. Please. Why fool yourself any longer? I know there is a ticket at the American consulate for your husband. He will go and get it soon. He will go away. He will leave you alone. He belongs among his own kind just as you belong here with me, Manon. Why do you avoid me? You know you came here to be held. To be loved. To be kissed. And wheedle out of me what you want. - No. No? You misunderstood my visit. - Have I? Forgive me. It is my fault for coming here. I would rather you laughed at me. Anything for me? One moment please. Two cables, Monsieur. - Thank you. Nothing like hearing from friends. Nice to know they've not forgotten you. Here are my hats and dresses, Monsieur. Don't you think they're beautiful? Madame, they are beautiful. Well, they are nice. What's going on here? Darling, don't interfere. I am better at making bargains. Pretty, isn't it? The best material too. - You're selling your clothes? Of course. Hats too. I see. No good, huh? - No. I'm tired of them. Besides, I have so many. I don't like that hat on you. It makes you look like a goon. Yes, Monsieur. Madame is beautiful in everything. He's in love with me so it will be easy to make bargains with him. Make your price, Monsieur. All these and the ones in the closet. All for you and all are beautiful. I won't take one sou less than ten thousand francs. Madame, that is a bit too much. What? Too much? Look, darling. Look. He is wrapping them. You don't mind? You are unhappy. You don't want to go away? Away? - Without me? Never. You don't mind waiting just a little longer? Three months, three years. Three hundred years. All the same if it's like this. I'm very happy to have done fine business with you. Wait a minute. How much for this? - Don't. You need it. Not me. Time was made for slaves. How much? - Seven hundred francs. And fifty. That's about twenty dollars. Okay. It's a deal. - It is worth more. That's what he thinks. It cost three bucks in an auction sale. Thank you. - Thank you, Monsieur. Not that way. This way please. It leads to the back stairs. I understand, madame. May Allah bless this sweet home and paradise shine in it every hour. Goodbye, madame. We are rich again. How much did we steal off Allah's friend? Three hundred dollars. Well, come right in. Have a chair. Thank you, Monsieur. The rent, huh? How much do you claim we owe you? - Twelve thousand francs. A little over 300 dollars. That's too much. Tell you what I do. I'll give you .. Nothing. What for, Monsieur? We haven't a cent. I thought we had a little something. Absolutely nothing. Come to think of it, she is right. But if you'll give us another month we promise to eat very lightly. Give up champagne altogether. I've cabled some friends. Please, Monsieur. I have read the answers. It was my duty. - That is very wrong. No. It's only fair. A hotel manager can't afford to be a gentleman. Not when dealing with gentlemen. I walked into that one. I'll be frank with you. - No, Monsieur. It is my painful duty to ask you either to pay your bill or leave the hotel. We must pack our trunks? - Not your trunks, Monsieur. Only two suitcases. The rest you must leave behind. - What? All my beautiful hats and dresses? They're worth thousands of francs. I hope so, madame. I expect these rooms to be vacant by tonight. We fooled him. We fooled him. You fooled him. Won't he be surprised when he walks in on an empty closet? We won't be surprised when we start to walk around on an empty stomach. Manon, my unpredictable little screwball. What is 'screwball'? A girl with one dress and laughing about it. Don't tell anybody. But I love her. Are you Gaston Lubois? Oui. I am William Carey. I hear you're looking for somebody to help out. An assistant. Do you speak the native language? No. I don't. I am learning. I'm doing pretty good. Cut the bread, Nina. He'll be home soon. Why don't you eat in the caf?, Manon? - This is much cheaper. He might like it better in the caf? for one night. I am taking care of him. You love him very much, don't you? Very much. Manon, tell me. He can go away alone if he wants to, can't he? Yes. He can always go away. Alone. - Will he go? No. Why haven't you done something, Manon? What good is it for him to look for a job here? You always say it's wrong for him to stay here in Saigon. You said, if he went anywhere else .. He would be very happy and get rich right away. Anywhere else? Manon, if you went to see Delaroch. Maybe he's changed his mind now and will help you and Bill. Yes. He could help. Have we any butter? No. It's so hot. And it melts away. Manon. Hello ladies. Bill. - How are you, Fatima? Nina. - Hello Bill. Don't tell me. Let me guess. Filet mignon? Turkey? - No. I give up. - Rice with noodles. I never would have guessed. The fourth time in a row you fooled me. How is Louis, Nina? - He is fine. I forgot. He is waiting for me. Goodbye. Bye. I had a big day today. - I am glad. I stopped by the English pub and won five bucks at cribbage. Had to do a little cheating. On myself. See anybody else? Yes. Had a talk with Monsieur Gobinalle. Beginning to weaken him. A few more visits and I'll have him on the ropes. Have one? Bill. I have been thinking. That maybe if you go away by yourself. You'll see your friends and then .. Maybe it will be easier to send for me. You've been thinking that? Plotting to get rid of me. Darling, you can't stay here forever. Look. Do you love me? I swear. More every minute? There are no more minutes. As much as you can? - All of me. That is the correct answer. Now cut out the jokes and dish up the turkey. I just want to see you when you get a look at the Empire State Building. Eight million feet high and all made of Emeralds. Yes, sir. And a roof of gold. There's a little place on 52nd Street. Wait until we walk in there together. Why don't you lie down? Yeah. That's a good idea. Repose is good for the soul. Oh boy. This heat gets you. Don't it ever snow around here? Manon. Manon. Yes, darling? Any water around? Just a moment. I am sorry. Who has this hangover, you are me? Are you getting up? - Why should I? I went down to see Nina last night. You did? She told me something. - Alright. Shoot. You know Louis the corporal? He said they need somebody at the Saigon Rubber Company. He said that? You tell Louis I said he was crazy. They don't need anybody any place. I've had my nose in every dive and office in this Paris of the east. No dice. Don't you think you should go there and ask? It's a waste of time. I feel like I've been shot out of a cannon. What's for breakfast? - Eggs. Good old eggs. All that silly fire-water last night. Me passing out on you. There will be other nights. There had better be. Well. We're no good for each other if we starve, are we? Saigon Rubber Company. I'll have a swing at that job. Where's that shirt I've been saving? The one with the buttons on. Bill. Yeah? It is so hot outside. Maybe you should stay home. I'll be home soon enough. These inquiries take two minutes flat. I think you're wasting your time. It is foolish, really. I don't think Louis knows anything. Please. Shouldn't I ask once for luck? - No. I should not have told you. Bill. Please. I see. You are afraid I'll be disappointed again. It's the best cure for a hangover I know. Listen, honey. There's one thing I've learned to do and do well. That is how to take 'no' for an answer. Monsieur. I tell you you have been misinformed. We have no places for strangers, aliens or gentlemen who walk in off the street. We are one of the oldest and largest institutions in Indochina, Mr Carey. Come here. Oui, Monsieur. Excuse me one minute. Yes, sir? That is Mr Carey. The young man Mr Delaroch told us to employ. But of course. I forgot. Get him back, you simpleton. - Monsieur. Monsieur Carey. Forgive me please. Our manager wishes to see you. He has been studying you. This way please. Monsieur Carey. We leave in a moment. - Be right with you. Shall we defy the Saigon Rubber Company and take you along? They told you there's no place for women. I guess we can't. Would you like to go? Yes. Oh yes. - That's what I want to hear. Don't look like that or I'll go back on the breadline. I went to school with them. You did? We are going now, Monsieur Carey. Will you be alright for a month? - Yes. Me too. You will write me? - Every night. Bill. Remember how I love you? Nothing else. Monsieur Delaroch's car is waiting. Hello, Mr Carey. Yes, Ling? You hot? Yes? Yeah. I'm hot. You get letter, no? No. You get a letter, yes. - No. Oh yes. Why not say so before? You no ask me. She say she love you very much, yes? She doesn't have to say that. She says she's well and she misses me. She counts the days until I come back. - She come back? No. I. Me. She come back. What else she say? She says Nina is happy because .. Because Louis has not been drunk for two whole days. The stove has been fixed. She has made some new curtains. She bought a beautiful new hat for twenty francs. Too bad. What's bad about that? Because it means she lost her hat. Doesn't say anything about losing a hat. If she not lose hat, why she buy new one? You got me there. I think so. Come, darling. We'll be late. - Late? Yes. For the opera. But I told you I didn't want to go. - Why? I do not want to go. - Yes. I know. But why? Are you afraid of being seen with me? You're afraid he'll find out and someone will tell him when he comes back. That he'll leave you and you'll have no-one left but me. Surely, Manon. He loves you more than that. Surely he will forgive and understand .. If he finds out that you went to the opera with me for one evening. Manon? By the way. I dropped in to see Mr Gobinalle. It seems the commandant answered my cable and your passport is in order. My passport? No. Yes. Here it is. You see, Manon. I keep my promises. Yes. Yes. It is signed. It is signed. And the seal. It is sealed. It says .. I can go everywhere. Everywhere. Yes. I know, my dear. Can we start now? Start? - For the opera. Yes, of course. Thank you. You see how prettily she pleads to be forgiven for her sins? They're not sins to her. You see? He forgave Manon. Yes. He forgave. Well. Doesn't that ease your heart a little? He forgave. Please take me home now. I am tired. Home? Yes. Very well. Do I seem like a stranger? Oh no. - How do I seem? Like everything I dreamed of. And more. - Very good. I killed a tiger. You were in danger? - No. The tiger was. Know how much rubber comes out of a tree in 24 hours? No. Enough to make 175 pencil erasers. Ask me another. Go on. Bill. I have some news to tell you. Nice news? Oh yes. Bill. I'll tell you later. I can't talk. Neither could I. It's like drowning. No .. like flying. Here we are. The halls of Arcady. We got a new spittoon. Wake up. Time to eat. Monsieur Carey. You're back. I am glad. I won't keep you awake long. Key to Number 17. Number 17. Yes, Monsieur. There is a letter for you. - Thank you. You go right back to sleep. - Thank you. Come on. I'll race you upstairs. I've missed you, darling. It has been awful. I have something very serious to ask you. What is it? - Does the bathtub still leak? The landlord promised to have it fixed next year. I knew we'd get action. Bill. I didn't tell you the news. What was it? I hope you don't like your job too much, Bill. Why is that? Because the commandant came back and .. I went to see him last week and he said about the passport .. Can't hear you. I said about the passport, Bill. I went to see the commandant. What's all this? What? A clipping from the society column of the Saigon Herald. I don't mind you going to the opera with Delaroch but .. Why should anybody send me this? 'Delaroch, president of the Saigon Rubber Company'. That's kind-of interesting. I didn't know that. You were there of course. Yes. How did he come to ask you? Please don't look like that. Sorry, I'm talking like an ape. Was it a nice opera? - Yes. Very nice. The music was lovely. It didn't put you to sleep? - No. They always do me. I got a blind spot for opera. What is all this about the commandant being back? I heard he wasn't due for .. Is there anything I should know? Tell me. He used to be friend of yours, didn't he? Forgive me if I'm a little jealous. I'm not going to holler too much. How did this get here? This is Delaroch's cigar case. No. It is not his. It's his alright. 'P.D'. Pierre Delaroch. When was he up here? No, darling. He was not up here. - Then how did ..? I found it in my purse after the opera. You put it in my robe, huh? - Yes. You're lying, Manon. No, darling. I'm not lying. What purse did you have at the opera? You brought it home in this? Bill, you must believe me. - Stop lying. He was up here. - No. No. - Stop it. That night when you went to see Nina. You did not wake me when you came back. The next morning, Santa Claus had a job for me. I walked in on Delaroch's stooges like a blind half-witted fool. I get sent out of town for a month. - No, Bill, Please. You must not say that. Don't. You saw Delaroch that night. Arranged for him to get rid of me. - No. Not to get rid of you. Oh? So you did see him. It's like. Getting hit over the head in the dark. He sent me away like that. No. Not like that. Go on. Tell me. I can't. Go on. - No. He gave the job because you asked him to. Answer me. He's been up here in our room. He promised to help me get a passport. I didn't want to lose you. I wanted to go away with you. Let go of me. Let go, I said. So he got you a passport. That's how he worked it. He bought me off with a job. Now he lets me take you away with me. Go on back to him. He is your kind. No, I am your Manon. Manon. - Yes. The same Manon who loved you and will always love you. I would die for you. I was told about you. There's something inside you that would crawl out one day. I'm looking at it right now. - No. You belong with them, Go back to your barefoot sisters with their black teeth. No, no! Bill. Don't say that. Why not? No. - Get away from there. What will you do? - Where's Delaroch? I don't know. - You don't want me to find him. You want someone to kiss? Caught by that cheating heart of yours? 19 Rue Lavin. Yes. I heard it from Madam Messier herself. She came to me yesterday. The commandant returns tomorrow on The Hercules. But why? He had another month in France. There is an old proverb. 'Once the orient has touched your heart'. 'It will never beat in the West again'. Thank you. Please excuse me. I'll return in a moment. Do go on without me. I'll be right back. I didn't expect you this evening, Manon. What is the matter? Has anything happened? You sent a letter to him. - A letter? That is why you took me to the opera. And why you came to my room to make sure he would find out. You knew, didn't you? Knew what? That I would never be about to use the passport you got me as his wife. That is why you got it for me. Manon. I gambled for you and I won. He's coming here to kill you. Please don't be stupid. He will kill you. And they will arrest him and send him to Devil's Island. Now, my dear. You must try to be calm. I assure you, your bad-tempered husband is not going to kill me. I'll see to that. - No. I have come to save him from that. He will not shoot you and be taken away to rot in prison. They will not take him to Devil's Island to rot and die. I can save him from that. From nothing else. But from that. You cannot shoot a man who has loved you like I have. We are the same. We two are the same. Yes. We are the same. We are both evil. Don't shoot. [ Gunshot! ] Let's look over here. - No. The shot came from over there. He is dead. - Run for the police. Who was out here with him? - Mademoiselle Manon. I knew it was she when he left the table. You let her in? Look in the garden. She's probably still here. No. The gate is open. My heart is wearing away. Why must we forever .. Say. Goodbye? [ Gunshot! ] Manon. What are you doing? I am watching the boat. It will be gone soon. I heard a gun. It frightened me. I thought maybe .. Manon. It was you. Yes. Oh, Manon. Manon. You must be quiet. He found out? Yes. I'll get a doctor. - No. Then I'll get Bill. There is no Bill. You must do something for me. Get the priest. Father Antoine? I want to tell him. How bad I am. I want to tell him all the bad things I have done. Then maybe. He will say something nice to me. Later. Put me on the riverboat and send me back to my mother. Hurry, Nina. Quick. Tell no-one but the priest. I'll get him. Nina. Where is she? - Monsieur, before you go .. Before you see her you must know .. I've run my head off looking for you. I went to the hotel first. The police are there. They'll figure out this stop next. Where is that passport? You got it on you? Is there a back door to this place? We're getting out of here if the street is clear below. A boat leaves tonight. I see it. If we make it before the police get word to them, we've a chance. We? If we get to Singapore with no questions asked, we can hop an English boat out. You want me? I'll tell you later. - No. Tell me now. Yes. I want you. And I want you to forget what I said. It wasn't true. I don't care what you've done. I don't know whether it was right or wrong. All I know is, there's more to love than running out when you're hurt. I want you, Manon. Forever. You want me forever. Yes. I love you. What's the matter? Nothing is the matter anymore. Manon, what have you done? Manon. Bill. Darling, I'll get a doctor. No. Don't go away. Nina has gone for the doctor. Hold me. There's a doctor on that boat. A good doctor. If we can get aboard with your passport we'd be free. No questions asked. Can you make it? Yes. I am strong. Carry me. Yes. Yes. Oh yes. Yes. Manon. Darling. Manon. Love me one moment more. [ Ship's horn ] [ Ship's horn ] Our boat. Manon, you mustn't die. You hear me? You can't leave me. You've got to live. Bill. Don't cry for me. I could never be happier than now. Remember. I love you. Manon. Manon. Manon. Father. Father, help us. She goes where there is no east or west. She will be judged by one who alone knows how great or little were her sins. ..r-o-s..
