Why did you come up? Switch off the electricity, this is water leaking up here. I can't find the ATM card Well, see if it's between your documents and stuff. Kati, dear, don't go there, it's dangerous. Oh, my God! You could only hear the sobbing of Mashti Hassan's wife, sitting alone with her lit lantern on the stable's roof and the desperate moans of a cow from inside the stable. Sir! Is it a true story? True? No, but you could say that in a way, in Saedi's stories the scenery, the type of characters, and relationships are real. Very real. How can someone turn into some sort of animal, sir? Tried looking in a mirror lately. You think you're funny, huh? But seriously, Sir, how does a person turn into a beast? Gradually... Sir, are we gonna watch the film of this story too? Yeah, that's a good idea. Maybe I bring it next time and we can watch it together. Yes? Sir, when are we gonna see your play? The performance begins next week. After we've had a few performances , I'll definitely invite you all to come. - Thanks, Sir! - What's it called, Sir? "Death of a Salesman", Anyone here read it? "The Enemy"! Jokes aside, have any of you read it? Sir, who's the author? Arthur Miller. Hmm... no, I've not. Very good. Excuse me, boys. Yes? Hello. Yes, that's right. Sorry, I can't talk right now, I'm in class. If you call back in 10 minutes, I'll be free. Yeah, with stick shifts... Silver... Sure... that's fine. Sir, what's your role? The Salesman. - What are you selling, Sir? - Potatoes! When you come, you'll see for yourselves. Which model is it, Sir? - What? - Your Peugeot 206, you know. - Why do you wanna know? - Aren't you selling, Sir? Sir, his dad's a parking officer, just tell him to fix your tickets for you. Do you even ever commit anf sort of driving offenses, Sir? Sir, why do Iranians call BMWs "Bee-Em-Veh's"? I didn't hear you. Why do Iranians call BMW's "Bee-Em-Veh's"? - Get outta here! - Fella, never mind! That's alright. He doesn't know, so he's asking. I don't know either. Guys... eh, for your next session... I want a summary of this story. I don't want any excuses, like... "I fell asleep, we had guests", and... stuff like that. Mister, could you please scooch over a bit? Sir, can I sit in front and this young man sits back here? Father... Somebody in there? No, I think the noise was from the next door. - No, no, somebody got in your bathroom! - No, there's no one there. It's the next room, there's a party. These kind of noises are normal... Can I come out? There's some insect crawling around in the bathtub, Willy! Ah, Miss Francis, you better go back to your room. They must be finished painting by now. But I can't, I've got to get dressed first! Yes, you can, you can! Please! Biff, this is Miss Francis, my next-door neighbor. They were painting her room. And she asked to come and use the bath. And I said, that's alright. So, I let her take a shower here. You can go back to your room now. But, Willy, I don't have any clothes on! Please, get out of here! Go back to your room. You promised me stockings, Willy! I have no stockings here! Why? You had two boxes of size 9s for me, and I want them, Willy! Alright, take one and go. For God's sake, will you get outta here! Please! Go! I just hope there's nobody in the hall. I can't go out without any clothes! By the way, are you... football or... Dammit! Siavash! What happened, mom? I do my best to ignore it but he keeps getting worse every night! Sadra, dear, come down, let's go! Sanam, dear, just ignore him. He thinks just because I'm playing a whore, he can do whatever he wants. What's that got to do with it? Why don't you laugh at the others then, huh? I was laughing at your clothes, not you... Shut up! Shut the hell up! Siavash, come here! Sanam, don't be childish on this final night. Sanam... Alright, I'm very sorry... I'm sorry. In this cold, rehearsing every night, with this child. Let's go, honey. You just had to fuck it up, didn't you? What's that got to do with us? It's your own husband. Ah, come on! Let me take the k... Let go! Sanam, don't... I said get off! - I was kidding... I was kidding! - I said get off! - I was messing with you. - Where are you going? Comes out of the shower with a raincoat, and says, "How can I go out without any clothes?" I can't, man, it makes me laugh. Go after her or she'll get annoyed and won't come tomorrow. Don't make me go out without clothes! I'm shy! Come on, how can I go out without any cloth... Sanam! The guy's totally nuts! Did you find a place? 60 sq. Meters, 3rd floor, no elevator. 40 mils in front, 600k tomans per month. - Where? - Amiratabak. - What sort of a place are you looking for? - Something temporary... If we can't find anywhere, we have to bring our stuff, and live right in the middle of the stage. - You free tomorrow afternoon? - Why? I'm taking you somewhere. Come on guys... once more from the top, no interruptions. You tired? Nope. Oh, you're here too! Aww kitty! Who's this? Come here, you! He's tame... What's up, kitty? This place is cool! Babak. Is that the storage room? - Which one? - This. No! It's the second bedroom. - Really? - Well, yeah. - Isn't it too small? - It's a two-bedroom! So, it's good? You're just two people, what do you need all this space for anyways? Watch your mouth, "two people"! Who knows, maybe we end up being three people... Rana, is he serious? No, come on! - He doesn't look like it. - Why is that? Is this door locked? Is it locked? The previous tenant's stuff is in there. They're supposed to be collecting it. Don't be scared, kitty, it's just me. Come here. - How long's it been vacant? - Three weeks. What are they doing to this city? I wish we could tear it all down, and start over. They've already destroyed and rebuilt it, and look how it's turned out... Babak? Yes dear. God have mercy on us. When do you think she'll clear her stuff out? She promised she'll do it in the next couple days. There's no parking, you'll have to leave your car on the street. That's alright. We're selling the car to pay your mortgage down payment. Who mentioned money? Well, either way... Hello, Hello, Mr. Salimi. One of the good things about this place is Mr. Shanazari and his wife. - Hello. - Hello, how're you doing? - Hello. - Hello, hello. How do you do, Ma'am? Babak, which one's the storage? It's here, come, take a look. - Mr. Salimi? - Yes? The door's open, take a look. Please, make sure it doesn't turn out like the last one. - No, come on, I know these guys. - You said you knew the last ones too. Don't worry about it. - Babak, what do they do? - They're my friends, they're into arts. I hope so. It's okay for a few months. Just make sure he lets us pay him for it. No favors. Looks like we've finally caught a break. Careful, don't rush. You need help, Sir? - No, you go ahead and bring the rest. Just careful not to hit the light bulb. Sorry, sir, thanks for the help. - Are the keys here too? - She took that one room's with her. Where's Ali? - Ali! - Yep? For God's sake, leave that alone, I'll call an electrician tomorrow. - It'll only take a second. - Leave it, man! If she'd said, we wouldn't have hired the truck and the movers. What can I say? She sounded so sure that, I didn't think she'd bail on us. So, what's she saying now? Hasn't answered ever since this morning. Why don't you try from a different number? Bring your phone, Rana. We really need that room, we've brought all our stuff. Yes. Okay. He's here if you like to talk to him. Thanks. Says, she's said all she has to say to you. Well, what did she say? That, she's signed the contract on a new place two days ago, but the landlord bucked at the last moment, she's looking for a place, and can't move her stuff until she finds somewhere. She said to tell you not to let anyone touch her stuff. Please! Oh, yeah, and she doesn't want to talk to you again. Any news? What happened? I don't know, nothing for now. Let me take it, Kati. - Ali! - Yes? You got a screwdriver in your car? This is enough stuff for a bride's dowry! I thought it was just a few bits and pieces. - Maybe we should leave it. - It's fine, I'll take the responsibility. Alright, boys, let's move those things over there. Rana... These are people's belongings. - Huh? - These belong to someone. What do you want me to do? It's been 3 days now. She keeps saying... "I'm coming today, I'll come tomorrow." What if she shows up? Well she should've kept her word then. Never mind. Come on! Guys, I can't carry anything heavy! Come on, let's eat. Rana, dear! Yes, dear? Honey... the charger. I'll turn into words, run through your ears... I'll turn into thoughts, stick in your head... I'll be a Benz, race under your feet... I'll be poverty in your purse... I'll be a wolf, raid your herd. You two, go to the door and bring over one of those boxes. Hi guys. Are these your 206's car parts, Sir? Put these in front of the principal's office, tell the librarian to come see me. Put these in front of the principal's office, tell the librarian to come see me. Very good guys, I want the poem memorized for next time. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye, Sir. Bye. - Bye, Sir! - So, long. Thanks Sir. Goodbye. - Sir, can I say something? - What? Sir, I was really pissed off the other day. Which day? The day, that woman insulted you in the Taxi. Was it an insult? You know, that she said, she wants to sit in the front seat. Sir, after you got out of the car, I told them that you were my teacher. And that we all love you so much. Like, all the guys. - What was your first name, again? - Amin. Amin, I'm sure, some guy must've done something to her in a taxi before... to make her think that way about everyone. Don't worry about it, it's just the first 100 years that are tough. So long. - Bye, sir. - Bye. Okay. Of all the time... I don't know what to do with her. Who? This woman... I called to ask when she'll clear her stuff out. She got angry, started threatening... Over what? "Why did you touch my personal things? Those were my private stuff... I'll sue you..." Last night I was running around, saving her stuff from the rain, up until morning. Her problem's something else... - Who Babak, the woman? - Yeah. When's she coming to get her stuff? Says, whenever she finds a place. Sadra, darling, come here with me. Hurry up. Hurry up guys, the audience will be in in five minutes. Emad... Emad... They're coming here again after the performance. They've approved 3 of the 6 revisions, there's another three left. Stay around and talk to them. - Tonight, after the performance? - Yeah. If it helps, I'll stay. Sure, or else they might cancel the whole show tomorrow. - How many did they say? - Three... Guys will you please hurry up! I'll go, then. Won't you wait around? No, you'll be stuck here until around midnight. Take the car, then. Where are the house keys? In my coat's pocket. - Have a good performance. - You too! Say, on your way back, if the supermarket's open... buy something, we've got nothing for breakfast. Yes, I said, if it's... if it's open! Also, pick up some hand sanitizer. Maybe I take a shower until you get here. No, not at all, I'm a mess. I haven't even wiped off my stage makeup. I'll be out soon... soon. Yup... love you, bye. - Anything else? - That's all, thanks. Be my guest. Are you paying by card? No, cash. - Yes? - Hello, Ma'am. Hello. Good evening, I'm your upstairs neighbor. We've just moved in, could you open the door, please? Thank you. Rana! Rana! Rana! Rana! What happened to you? Please, step outside, Sir. You can't be in here, Sir. We'll call you for the CT scan. - Wait outside, please. - Look at me, Rana! Everything's fine, I'll call you for the CT scan... Please. Make sure you change the locks, first thing tomorrow. Why? Did someone get into the house? I thought she'd fainted, was dizzy or... We don't know what happened yet. All of a sudden we heard shouting and screaming from upstairs. Not like, normal, not once, scream after scream... I told him go upstairs and check, he said, couples get into fights all the time. Then, we heard some heavy bangs in the stairs, I told him "Muhammad, God knows, something's up." Who was it? When we reached the stairs, we just saw someone fleeing up the street. I don't know what happened to his foot, but, it had bled all over the stairs. If I'd caught him, he'd be dead now. Then we went upstairs and found your wife unconscious... there was blood all over the bathroom floor. I dressed her and brought her here. Never mind that, thank God something worse didn't happen. Woman, do us a favor, go to the ER, check if there's any news or something. Sorry for putting you to all this trouble. Have a seat, sit down, son. Was anything missing from the house? I don't know. I didn't notice anything. I don't think it was a robbery. What would a thief be doing in the bathroom? Then, who was it? The guy was one of that woman's customers. Who? What woman? The woman who lived there before you moving in. Tell you the truth, she was kind of messed up... and I think, the guy came here on account of her still being there. Don't close the door, Ali's coming up. Sure. Come on, lie down. Grab my sleeve, hold it. Thanks. Wait, let me take off your scarf. - You want me to add another pillow? - No. Turn off the light, so she can sleep. Don't turn it off. - Can I get you anything? - No, thanks. Where are you going, Emad? Darling? I said, where are you going? I'm not going anywhere, I'm here. You need anything? Nope. Leave the door open. Okay, thanks. Look, her blood pressure's low, careful when she's walking. Thanks for everything. Sit down guys, I'll make you some breakfast. No, thanks, we're late. Come on, you haven't eaten since last night. Kati, you wanna stay here, and make soup or something for them? - You want me to stay? - You want Kati to stay? - No, no. - You sure? You must be tired. Go, get some rest. - Call if you need anything. - Really, man, just let us know. - Thanks again for everything, guys. - Bye. Scrap metal... iron doors... aluminum doors... Fences... metal dishes... buying... Scrap metal... lamps... samovars... Anything, bring it over... Come on, stand here while I use the bathroom. What are you doing? - Leave it, I'll wash it myself, Rana, dear! - Come and wash it then. Alright, turn off the water and come out. Then, come and clean it before I use it. The police might need to see it. Yes? Of course, sorry. Who was it? One of the neighbors. - What did they say? - I'll be right back. Sorry. Sorry for all the trouble, ma'am. Now, come on, don't say that. If you ask me, you better call 110... they'll be able to track him down from his car. Yeah, definitely. Anyways, I'll try to find some place... I thought, when that woman left, she took all her troubles with her. Have you ever seen this car's owner around here? Well, it wasn't like, just a couple guys visiting her. I might have to trouble you again when the police comes... to explain what you exactly saw. Yeah, sure. Would you like to take my cell number? Yes, please. - I'll get going. - Thank you so much, ma'am. They should tie an ewer around these guys' necks... parade them around the city, shaming them. 0912... Why are you out here? Come in. I'm scared of being alone in the house. Where were you? I went to thank the neighbors for last night. - What did they say? - Nothing. They asked how you were. You didn't tell Kati and the guys what happened, did you? No. Okay, I'm going to the police station... to file a complaint for them to start looking for the guy. How're they gonna find him? He left his pickup. And his mobile, but it's disconnected. Who was he, Emad? The neighbors say the woman who lived here before us, was shady. The scumbag must've been one of her customers. Came here on account of her. You remember what he looked like? No. Didn't you get a look at him? It's cold. Come inside, you'll catch a cold. Gimme that. Who got me out of the bathroom? One of the neighbors. Which one? I don't know, just forget it. Eat your breakfast. And then go get some rest. I can't. As soon as I close my eyes that scene comes to my mind. How did he get in? I opened the door, I thought it was you. I came out of the bathroom, buzzed him in, and then went back. I was shampooing my hair when I realized someone had come in. He put his hand in my hair from behind, I thought it's you. Then, I saw his hands, and after that, it's blank. Rana... Darling, have some breakfast. Rana, dear... Sweetie... What about tonight's performance? I called and told them to cancel it. - No, call and say I'm coming. - How? In this condition of yours? It's harder for me to stay at home. Put this on, let's go to the police station. We might get held up there for a while anyways. No, leave it. Let's not go to the station. We can't just do nothing! I don't want to go stand there, and... tell a bunch of officers or whoever what happened. Did something happen that you can't tell? No. Then, don't say anything. I'll tell 'em myself. I can't, it'll be too much. No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda. When I'm walking in the street, I clearly feel these things... They pass me by, but it's as if they're laughing at me with their eyes. Why? Why would they laugh at you? Don't talk that way about yourself, Willy. Sometimes they pass me by as if I don't even exist. As though nobody sees me. Nobody notices me. Nothing. Linda? How long are you going to spend repairing those socks, huh? You know it makes me angry. At least don't do it while I'm home, talking to you. Okay? Okay, let's talk about something else, like, my income. My never-changing income. God, this is really ridiculous. What's wrong with you? Why aren't you saying your lines? Willy, darling, you're the most handsome man in the world to me. You always say this to me, Linda, always, but it doesn't help me at all. I'll never be able to make you happy, you know why? Because, I'm just a salesman. I'm nothing! Nothing, Linda! But, I always tried... why are you crying, anyways? Wait, where are you going? Linda, come back... Sorry, I have to stop the play. I apologize to you all. My wife, the other actor, isn't feeling well. Please, give us a ten-minute intermission. Sorry. Can you carry on? Carry on what, Kati? Can't you see she's not well? Go, cancel it. You wanna go to the other room and lie down a little? Alright, guys, let's clear the room. She's not well. Sanam, dear. I'm coming. Can I get you anything? Kati darling... Go and cancel the show. What happened there? The way someone in the audience was staring at me bothered me. The audience want to watch the play, of course they'll be looking at you. Looked at me just like that guy. I thought you said you didn't see him. I'm really unwell, I just don't know what to do. Babak, come here a minute. Coming... Is she feeling better? Goddammit, man, what can I say to you...? Don't you think you had to let me know what kind of people used to live there? - What's happened? - You're supposed to be my friend. Seriously, what's happened? What is it to you who lived there before? That apartment's infamous in the whole neighborhood. - Who's said that? - Let's say nobody's said anything... why isn't this woman coming to collect her stuff? I just wanted to help. Remember last week... you wanted to sleep on the set? Regardless, why did you hide from me that woman's line of work? What hiding? Well, yeah. Did you tell me or not? Was I supposed to pass on to you some unfounded gossip? To upset you? Well, what's going, anyways? What's this all about? Babak, I'm going. I'm coming. Go take a look at Rana, you'll see what this is all about. They said she slipped in the bathroom. We said right in front of you we might be having a kid in that place. And you didn't say a word, what kind of... You were joking! If we weren't joking, would you have told us? Told you what? Gimme a break! Put yourself in my shoes, that same room we sleep in, each night... how many strange men have been with that woman. Don't take it so hard on yourself. I haven't cashed your check yet. Whenever you find another place whose previous tenants had your approval, you can move out. - Hello. - Hello. How are you doing? Careful not to slip on the stairs Mrs. Shahnazari, they're wet. I was actually going to ask the cleaner to come early and sort these out. But, I thought you'd want to report it, the police might want to see them. Well, it wasn't such a big deal. You wouldn't say it if you'd been there and... seen the state your wife was in, on the bathroom floor. When Mr. Alimoradi opened the bathroom door, he thought, God forbid, your wife was dead. Say hello for me to your wife. Get up, I've made you some breakfast. - I'm heading out. - Wait! Wait, let me get ready and come with you. Where to? I have class. I know, I'll wait in the car. It's not just an hour or two, you'll get tired. Then, don't go today. What? I said, don't go today. Let's say I don't, what about tomorrow then? The day after tomorrow? It's not gonna work. I can't stay here alone. I said, I don't want to be here alone. What can I do? You want me to get you a ticket to visit your parents for a few days? Looking like this? I've made up my mind... we either have to go to the police, or forget this altogether. Okay, forget it, but let's look for a place, right from today. Okay, we'll start looking. But until we find somewhere, you need to try and pick yourself up. What?! It's not something I can control. You taking your pills, and not staying up at nights getting worked up about it... is up to you, isn't it? Go take a shower. Here, I'll wait right here. I don't want to go in that bathroom. I'll drop you off at a friend's place. Use theirs. Go and tell them we've come to take a shower? So, what do you want me to do? You keep changing your mind. At night you tell me not to come near you, then in the morning you tell me not to leave you. Just tell me what the hell am I supposed to do? Just go, you're late. It'll take a couple of weeks to find a new place. What? You're not gonna wash up with that wound of yours? Sweetheart! Just think, it could've been worse. What if a piece of glass had gone in your eye, or... your head had been hit harder? Then... then, what the hell would I have done? I wish my head had been hit harder. God forbid! Honey, don't say things like that. Hello, Mr. Etesami. Hello Sir, how are you doing? Mr. Yeganeh gave me these books to give them to you. Be quiet. What's so funny? Why? He said they're not suitable for kids. Quiet! Mr. Yeganeh decided these weren't suitable for the kids? Go, throw them in the trash can. Why the trash can? Trash can. Throw them in the trash can. Give me your phone. I don't have a phone, Sir. Give it to me. I don't have a cell. Sir, wait a minute. Give it to me. Sir, there's nothing in it about you. I want to see what you have. I've deleted it. Let me see it. Sir, please, I've deleted it. Sir, I have private photos in there. Put your hand down. That's not fair. Mr. Etesami? Sir? I have personal things on there. I deleted the video. On my mother's life, I deleted it. Sir, send it on Telegram, for everyone to see. It beats watching this movie. I'll kick you out of the class, if you say another word. Mr. Etesami! Sorry, Sir. You stay out of this! I mean all of you. I'm talking to him. I deleted it. Please. Call your father to come to the school, he needs to see... the kind of photos you have on your cell. His dad's dead, Sir. - Hi, sorry about that. - Hi, no problem. If it's a hassle for you to keep moving it, you can leave it in the corner. Next to the boiler room. When my husband gets back, he'll move it to a better place. I don't want you to keep going up and down the stairs. I'm going out for a couple of hours, you can take my spot. Don't worry, I'll find a better place for it. - Suit yourself. - Sorry. If you give me the keys, I can move it for you. Thanks. My wife said, you're not going to report it. No. You're doing the right thing, they won't do anything, even if they catch him. And you'll have to explain over and over why you opened the door plus trekking back and forth to the court. Endless hassle for nothing. But, he'll probably be back for his car. Please, call me if he shows up. I'll sort out that bastard. I'll take mine out and then come and park yours. There's no need, I'll do it myself. Okay, then, goodbye. Thanks. Goodbye. How's it going? Hey, you okay? Is Rana here? - No, wasn't she with you? - She's coming on her own. Any news about the guy? What guy? Babak had heard some things from your neighbors. Where is he? Is he here? Babak? Yep, he's back there. Hi. Hi. Why didn't you tell me yesterday? What should I have told you? About the man turning up the other night. How's Rana? The neighbors have told you. They're also worried... Tell 'em nothing happened, the guy just barged in. Then, why are you keeping his pickup? Shahnazari said it's in the parking lot. Tell 'em we'll be gone soon we're looking for a new place. Where will you go? Like, I'm gonna let you. Can you find that previous tenant, and arrange a meeting for me? Why? I wanna talk to her. Ask her why she did this. Did what? Did what? - Sent this thug to our house. - Why would she do that? You said yourself, she made threats about us touching her stuff. She's nothing like that. She hasn't taken her stuff because she still hasn't found a place. She was just mad at me that day. Hello. Feeling better? Yep, I'm fine, thanks. Did you tell the guys? No. Then how do they know? One of the neighbor called Babak. I'm not sure what they said. Emad, get dressed and come for the make up. My outfit's not here. Kati's going to take your place tonight. And you accepted, just like that? What can I do? It's not up to me. The director wanted her to replace you tonight. If you're alright, and you can do it, I'll go talk to her. No, I don't want to. Have you started house-hunting? No, I will do, when I get time. When you get time! Like it doesn't matter how I feel in that place! You haven't done anything. Huh? I want us to go to the police, but you won't let me. What do you mean? You said you'd drop by the school, find a substitute teacher, and pick me up. Well, I couldn't find anyone. Auntie? Yes, Baby? Why aren't you acting tonight? I'm not feeling well tonight, darling. Why did you come here then? I get bored at home. What? I get bored at home. Well... I get bored here. Would you like to come to our house this evening? Do you have SpongeBob? No, but we can go buy it on the way home. From tomorrow you really need to perform again. Everything's topsy-turvy. Everybody's making mistakes. Why? I don't know, everyone's upset. You're better now, you should act again tomorrow. - Mommy! - Darling? - Can I go to Auntie's house? - No, baby. Let him stay with me tonight, I'm alone. I'll bring him with me tomorrow. He can't, his dad's coming to pick him up to go to his house tomorrow. Well, his dad can pick him up from our place. You wanna go? Yes! You won't be a nuisance to Auntie Rana? He won't. Tell Emad we're taking the car. Let me bring his things. I need to pee, auntie. I know, go on, go inside. Whose bike is this? That... belongs to some kid. Where's the kid? The kid's not here anymore. Where did he go? Huh? Where'd he go? Moved to a new house. Don't you need to pee? Oh, yes! Go on then. Not that one, over here. Well... it's dark! I'm coming... It's scary in there. Come on. No, I don't need to go anymore. Let me help. No, if you go... I... I'll do it. Are you feeling shy in front of me? Nope! Can you go yourself? I'm drawing his mustache. Yes? Come up, dear. Who was it? Uncle Emad. If it's my dad, then, tell him Sadra's not here. Why? Because I love my Mom. Okay. Rana! Hey. The pickup isn't in the parking. I parked it outside this morning. Why outside? I didn't fancy moving it every ten minutes. Hello! Hello, how are you, kiddo? Where are the keys? Where you'd left them. How are things with my favorite? Welcome to our house, all good? Welcome! Leave it where it is, Emad. I'll be right back. Emad... Emad... Let's forget it for one night, just leave it. I've made dinner, go wash up and change. Go on, darling. Ready for takeoff, ladies and gentlemen! Sadra! Yes! Emad, it's ready, come before it gets cold. Coming. Let's go wash those hands of yours. My hands are clean! Wash 'em again anyways. Wow, wow, wow, look at this! Thanks so much. Hands off! Rana, where are you? Sadra, come and eat! Hello. You, rascal! You two were out, having fun without me? We went shopping we hung out together. But, we didn't find SpongeBob. Yes, unfortunately. Don't worry, Patrick, eventually a good day will come when you and I will find someone. Look at this, SpongeBob! Look what Auntie Rana made, macaroni! More? No, no, that's enough. Okay, just let me know. Thank you. Wow, what a nice macaroni! Bon appetit! Let's eat it all. Look what she's made. Yeah, I know! How was tonight's performance? Very... not that great. It was terrible. You're lying. That's how it is without you. Did you find the credit card? No. How did you go shopping? With the money you left. What money? In the drawer. Why aren't you eating? Don't you like it? Is it not yummy? Don't eat it. What's up? It's the money that scumbag left, that night. Sadra? I've got an idea. Do you like pizza? Yep. Then let's order some pizza. Don't eat that, it's not good. What about fries? And after that, Ice Cream, huh? Hi there. Gimme a call when you can. Hello? Mum? Mummy? Hello? Ahoo, dear? You there? It's the 3rd time I'm calling. Ahoo, darling, it's Babak. Ahoo... Ahoo... Are you there? Guess not. Gimme a call when you get home, I'll be up late. What are you doing? Nothing. Come on, go sleep. You haven't slept for two nights. I can't sleep. Why did you open her letters? It's her private stuff. I wanna find out who the hell that scumbag was. Let's say you found out... He'll say it was a mistake. He came inside by mistake? He rang the bell and I opened the door. He must've thought it's her, since I opened the door so easily. He came here by mistake. What about when he realized his mistake? Why didn't he leave? Because, the bathroom light was on, and there was a woman in there? - How could he know it's a wom... - From your clothes on the bed. If I'd just used the damn intercom, asked who it was... None of this would've happened. If you think it's that simple... You can just tell all the neighbors about the intercom... Why are you getting the neighbors into this? They knew what was going on in this house. So, you're fine with it if they didn't know? What are you on about? Leave me alone. The pickup's not there. What? Sorry. Where was it? There. Sorry. Where did you leave it? I left it there. Where? Over there, where that Peugeot is. He's taken it. I have to find that asshole. Jackass! Okay, slow down! You're gonna freeze in there. Never mind. What do you mean, never mind? You'll get sick. Let's go to a public bath. No, I'll be out quick. Just wait here. Hasanpoor, come here a sec. Hello. What can I do for you, Sir? Hi. How's it going? Your dad was a traffic cop, right? He's retired now, why? - A car hit my wife and drove off. - Nothing serious, I hope? No, thank God. It was a pickup, if I give you the number plate... Can your dad find the guy's address? If it's not too much trouble, that is. Sure, he has contacts in the department. If you gimme the license plate, he can find out. But, I think you should report it. It wasn't anything serious, so I don't wanna get the police mixed up. Okay, gimme the registration and I'll call my Dad. - Get a pen and a paper, then. - 'Kay. Why don't you want to work for me? Have you lost your mind, Charlie? I've got a job. Then what're you walkin' in here every week for? Well, if you don't want me to walk in here... I'm offering you a job. I don't want your goddam job! I've got one already. Get outta my way! When the hell are you going to grow up, huh? Goddam you, Charlie! You, big ignoramus! Big ignoramus! How dare you talk to me like that? If you say that to me again, I'll rap you one! I don't care how big you are! You, degenerate! What's wrong with you tonight? What did I do? Why are you adding dialogues? What did I add? If you've got a problem with me, let's sit and talk. Not on the stage, calling me, "You degenerate!" It's neither improvisation, nor acting, you're insulting me. What? Did I hurt your feeling? Yeah. And if you do that one more time, I'll answer you right in front of everyone. Degenerate is the one who speaks his mind through swearing. Didn't know that. I'm really sorry. Bakery. Hello, how're you doing? Speaking Azeri. What can I do for you? Two baguettes, please. - You want 'em cut? - Thanks a lot. - That pickup's yours? - Why? There's an officer writing tickets, from the top of the street. Majid, come here, move the car. Before the officer slaps a ticket on it. Soheil, bring the keys. - Here you go. - Thanks. Later. Bye. Here you go, Sir. Thanks. Thanks, dude. I'll take a water. Hello, mister, sorry is that your pickup? Yeah. I had some load, I wanted to ask you to move it for me. Nah, that pickup is for a store. Well, not now, whenever you're free. No, it's just that, I do something else. I don't do that. Not even Friday? Nah. You can find pickups at the top of Haft-e-Tir. No, it's just that, my stuff are books and paintings, I was looking for a softopper. You know, on account of rain or things like that. I'm really busy. I don't have time. I don't care about the fee. I'll pay. I just want my stuff to get there safe. It's just that, I'm busy. I can't. Majid, come on, man. Help the guy. Late night or something. Well, how about you gimme your number? I'll call you whenever you say. And if you come yourself, even better. Bro, find some time between your schedule for him. Careful not to hit the walls. Ah! What're you doing here? Come here... kitty... Careful with that not to scratch it. Babak, tell 'em to come have a cup of tea. - There's no need for that. - It's getting cold. Where are you taking these? I'm taking 'em to my parents' parking lot. We'll see what happens. Won't she come to take 'em? She's got problems of her own. She hasn't found a place yet. Get up, Babak wants to take away that woman's stuff. What do you want me to do? What's going on between you two? Nothing, let him take 'em. That's okay with me. Hello? Majid? It's me, Etesami, couple days ago. You free today? How about Friday? Yeah? You? Yeah, come on up. Hello, can I help you? Hello, Sir. You okay? Have I come to the right place? Majid said, there's some stuff you need to move. That's right, come on in. Why didn't he come himself? Well, he was busy, so he sent me instead. - After you. - You first. But, he didn't say anything about all these stairs. With this heart of mine. Well, if I knew you're coming, I would've told him about the stairs, and the broken elevator. Well, I can't use elevators anyways, Sir. Would you gimme a glass of water? Have you hired movers? No, I thought he's coming. And, we'd take the boxes ourselves. Well, the poor guy was kinda busy today. - Is he your son? - Nah, my son-in-law. Doesn't make a difference though. He's like my own son. Sorry, old man, we just moved out. There's no glasses or anything. That's alright, mister. I'll drink from the tap. Where are the boxes? In that room. We'll see. If there's too many, we'll call movers. Give him a call. Maybe he's around here somewhere. I can pick him up. Who? Your son-in-law. Nah, the poor souls just went shopping for the "exchange of the vows" ceremony. Isn't the janitor allowed to help here? Nah, the building's empty. The walls caved, the residents have all moved out. Wow, wow! What if it collapses on us or something? Nah. Let's take a look and see if it's worth hiring movers. Grandpa! What? Would you come sit here for a sec? I wanna tell you something. Look here, mister, this isn't my line of work. Majid said, "there's this guy, who's called a couple times... would you do it?" I said, okay, why not? Now, you paying depends on how generous you're feeling. Nah, it's not about... wages, fees, and stuff like that. Just sit down. There's something I have to tell you. Good news, I hope. How long do you know this guy? - My son-in-law? - Yeah. What for? I wanna know if you know him well. Well, it's about two years they've asked for my daughter's hand. Have you asked around about him? Do you know Majid? If there's anything you know, just tell me. When my wife and I moved out of here, we went to a place that... its previous tenant was... you know, a woman of the street. One night, when I got home a little late. My wife was alone in the house. One of these lowlifes on account of that woman still being there... enters my house. While my wife was in the bathroom. The jerk goes into the bathroom. Who? That filthy son-in-law of yours. Now, how do you know it was Majid? When my wife starts screaming, the guy makes a run for it, but... He was in such a hurry that, he leaves his pickup behind. I found him from his pickup. I went down to where he works. I wanted to go there, grab hold of him... and dishonor him in front of all his co-workers, but... I couldn't bring myself to do it. This pickup changes hands a lot in that store. That's why I asked him to come here. To talk to him, and ask... if it was him or someone else. Majid's not like that. If I find out it's been him, I'll call off everything. The wedding and all. How's your wife, now? I don't know what to say. Let me talk to him tonight. Give him a call and tell him I wanna talk to him. Tell him to come here, I wanna ask him who's done it. Well, it's just, they've gone with my wife and daughter for "the exchange of vows" shopping. Well, at least give him a call. Ask him who had his pickup that night. When did this happen? About two weeks ago. Okay, so you just let me talk to him tonight. Oh my... oh my... But, I wanna talk to him, old man. Wait a second, I wanna talk to him. ...Call him. I don't have his number in my phone. I have it. When I say call him to come here, it's because I don't want to... go there, make a scene in front of his co-workers. You just let me make sure it's him. I have to talk to him in such a way that I'll get an answer... How about I call him myself, huh? You want me to do it? Okay, let me just dial his number. Hello, Majid? Hi, son... where are you guys? Yeah, I'm here with him. Who's with you? Listen, when you're alone, gimme a call. I wanna tell you something. Call my cell. I don't have it memorized. Ask Moj'gan. Okay... it's nothing... Bye. He said, he'll call when he's alone. Say, what do you do yourself? I work with this car of Majid's. His pickup. I sell clothes from the back of the pickup, at nights. And I don't come out during the day, on account of my heart. And, how come... you don't have your son-in-law's number? Well, I just don't. Not just him, a lot of people. Have you just bought this number of yours? No. How come... your son-in-law doesn't have your number? You just told him to get it from someone else, huh? I don't know, man, I don't know. I'm so messed up right now that... I don't even remember my own name. Wait a second, old man. - It won't open. - Not so fast. Wait a minute. If it's okay, I want you to take off your shoes. What for? I wanna see your foot. Mister, I'm as old as your father, you tellin me to take off my shoes? Open the door, let me go! I didn't do anything to you. Why are you talking like that? Take it easy. Just take off your shoes for a sec. Then, I'll open the door for you to leave. Why should I take off my shoes? Open the door! Hush! Come here. Let's go over there. Sit on the stair, for a sec, take off your shoes. Sit! Sit down! Just sit, okay? Take off your shoes, please. I'm not feeling well, just don't! - Well, let me help you. - I'll take it off, okay. I'll take it off. The other one, take off the other one too. Your socks too. Mister, what do you want from me? Take 'em off! I said, take off your socks. Let me do it myself. - No! - Let me! Just let me! Hello, Siavash! No, I'm a little busy right now. What time is it, anyways? No, I'll be there. Don't worry. She'll come herself... She's a little busy. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine. Okay, bye. Swear on my life, I didn't want to harass anyone. Did that woman tell you to go there that night? That woman had been messaging me for at least a month. She said, "If you still have the pickup, come over, I wanna see you." And I messaged back, "Ahoo, dear, sorry... I'm not feeling well. I can't come." She took it to herself. No matter how many times I called... She never answered. Didn't want to talk to me. That night, I thought I'd drop by and make it up to her. Didn't you know she's moved out? God knows, I had no idea. Swear on my kids' life... You opened the door, and went in. You saw the furniture is different... How come you're saying you didn't know? I went in, I saw a bunch of stuff, the bicycle I had bought myself... I thought maybe she's moving. You're not going anywhere until you tell the truth. If I had the slightest idea that you guys have moved in, I would've thought, maybe there's a man in the bathroom. - My wife's clothes were on the bed. - I didn't saw those. You saw those and figured there must be a woman in the bath. All alone, she even opened the door for you. I didn't see any clothes. It didn't take even five minutes. I came in, there was no one there. Just a minute ago, your wife had opened the door for me. Why did your wife open the door for me? Well, she thought it's me. Let me tell you what really happened. I went by the bathroom door, called the kid, as soon as I did... there starts the screaming. Then, I ran away. You went into the bathroom. I didn't go in the bathroom. Then, where was your foot cut like that? I have no idea. By the time I was downstairs... I felt a sting in my foot. I thought I've stepped on something in the stairs. Then, my wife's lying? Your wife says I went into the bathroom? My wife was scared and bumped into the glass, otherwise God knows what you would've done, dirty scumbag! I swear on my life or whatever's dear to you... as soon as I found out I'm in the wrong place, I ran away. Well, just tell your wife to come here. Here, I'll wait right here. Ask her. What's my wife supposed to say? My wife's said all she had to say. It's your wife's turn to come here. Call her, and tell her to come here, right now. What for? What you said, I want you to repeat in front of your wife. Mister, why don't you get it? I didn't go in that bath... Okay, you didn't! I want you to tell your wife what you were doing in that house. Call her, right now! Get it out, and call her! Nope! Get out your cell! Don't make me look bad in front of my wife and kids. Call her, right now. My daughter's about to get married. Your daughter has to know her real father. I'm gonna tell your son-in-law everything, just so he knows his father-in-law. I don't have to keep you here. Go on, get out! Go! I'm gonna call your son-in-law, tell him to bring your wife here... Leave me alone, mister! Ah! Someone help me! Help! Don't make noises! Quiet! Open the door! Open up! I'll die! I'm about to have a stroke. Open the door! Mister! Open the door! I'm afraid of closed spaces. Open the door, my boy. At least turn on the lights. Forgive me... my dear! I can't cry. Why did you ever do that to yourself? I don't understand it. Help me, Willy! It seems to me that you're just on another trip. I keep expecting you. I made the last payment on the house today. Right today. And there'll be nobody home. We're free and clear. We're free. Rana, lock the door, and take the keys. Get up... on your feet! Here, wait. Sit here. You go in that room. Look how mentally and emotionally shattered she is. There's my wife. You still gonna say you haven't gone into the bathroom? I'm sorry. Answer me. I made a mistake. Tell me, why did you go into the bathroom? I gave in to temptation. What are you gonna do to him? His family are on their way, I want his wife to know what he's done. You're taking your revenge. Let him go, let him leave. I know what I'm doing. You sit here, there's no need for you to come out. Where are you going? I'm not feeling well at all. Let me go. They're coming after you. Your son-in-law called, he asked about you. I told him to come over. And to bring your wife too. They're on their way. Sit down. I'm begging you, please let me go. When your family's here. Tell 'em everything you told me. Then leave. I'm begging you. Miss! Forgive me. Let me go, before they get here. That woman lived with me for 35 years. Mister! Get up! Get up, go! You, sit down! Leave him alone, let him go. He'll go, he will. When his family get here, they can leave together. Sit down! - For the love of God! - Here, mister, go. - Just, sit down. - Let him go! My girl! My boy! - Leave him alone, Emad! - You stay out of this! - Sit down! - Please. I said sit down! Ah! Sit... down! Here. What? What do you want? Oh, my God! Emad! Does he, by any chance, take any under-the-tongue pills? I searched. There's nothing in his pockets. - What happened? - Where are you now? No, no, get here as soon as you can. Okay, okay. - Was it the Emergency? - His family. They're coming. - Oh, my God! - Mister! Can you hear me? Does he have a pulse? Emad, can you hear his heartbeat? Rana, for God's sake, keep quiet. Let me see what I'm doing. Where are you going? He said he's got pills. Maybe they're in the car. Can you hear me? Open your mouth. Open! Mister! Get up! Can you hear me? Oh, God! Oh, God! You better now? You feeling better? Breathe! Breathe! You better, now? Don't worry, he's better. You didn't call the Emergency? No, I was afraid he might be dead. Wait a minute! If you say anything to his family, I don't wanna have anything to do with you. Yes? - Hello. - The elevator's broken, use the stairs. Okay... Come on, ma! You go ahead, I can't run with this pain in my legs. Ya Ali!... My dear. Come on in. Come in. Ya Allah! Dad! Dad! How are you dad? - Majid! - What? Come in. - Dad! Daddy! - Thank God, he's fine. You okay, dad? I'm fine. You're okay. That was such a scare, dad. Where's your mother? She's in the stairs. Let me call her. Majid, don't call her. - Let's go! - We'll go, dad, just wait a little. Majid! If mother doesn't see him, she'd think something must've happened to him. Let her see he's fine. Hello, sorry. We were in such a hurry that we didn't notice you. That's alright. Sit down, dad. What are you getting up for? I thought mother better come up and see you, and then we'll leave. Sit. We're in no hurry. Let him sit down until he gets better. We're really sorry, mister. Dad, just sit down. Can you? Yeah, I'm alright. Majid! What is it, ma? We're here. Come. Thank God, dad's sitting here. He's all right. What is, dad? Huh? - It's nothing, ma. - What happened? What happened to you? Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go? See what you're doing to me and yourself? Oh, God. Thank you so much, God! God knows, on our way here I vowed to give away a hundred different charities, just to hear his voice one more time. Thank God. How many times did I tell you not to go? My dear! I don't want you to work. I don't! Darling, you said, "Majid called, I have to go, I'll be back soon." Soon, you call this "soon"? Mom, we have to thank these guys, they stayed with him all this time. Or else, we don't know what would've happened to dad. We really don't know how to thank you. May God give you back, miss. He's my whole life, mister. Thank you so much. You gave me my life back. He's all I've got. Come on, mom, stop it. Get up, let's go. I'm sorry. Did you take all your stuff, dad? Where's your cellphone? Car keys. Where's his glasses? Don't leave without his glasses. I've got it... Come here, I'll give it to you. - You go, I'll get it. - Majid, the glasses... No, let him come. There's... this unfinished business we need to take care of. This way. What business? You just saved his life, son. No, mister, we've put you through enough trouble already. It's nothing fancy, you know. Come on, this way. Well, if there's anything to do, just let me... No, let him come himself. Come on, this way. You guys go. Majid. Let me... How much money did you leave in the room, that night? Huh? How much money did you leave in the room? I didn't count. What happened, dad? What happened to you? Oh, my God! What happened to you? He's sick again. What are these? Where were these? - Come on, sit down a little. - Is it your heart, dad? Let him sit for a while. Come on, this way. We can't leave like this. Majid! Majid, hurry up! - We're almost there, dad. - Esmat! I'm here, dear. - Esmat! - Come on, mom. Watch it, don't drop him. - Esmat! Esmat! - What? Darling, I'm here. What happened to you? Ya Abalfazl! Stretch his legs. Dad! Can you hear me? - God! Dad! You hear me? Dad! - Where are his pills? Where are his pills? Search his pockets. Stretch his legs! Hurry up! God help us! Dad, breathe! See if his pills are upstairs. Miss! Miss! Are my dad's pills here? He's got sick again, he's lying in the stairs. Mister, for God's sake, will you get on the way right away? Yes, miss, just give some time for my colleagues to get there. Just follow my instructions. His legs must be straight, not bent. He's lying face up. Mister, he's all blue in the face. Just keep doing what I told you. If you get tired, let someone else do it. Hello? Someone tell me how he's doing? He's not moving, mister... No, no, nothing. Not even his hands or legs? No. Mister, can we put his pill under his tongue? No, no, miss, don't give him anything, just do what I told you. Just make sure his legs, are stretched, not bent. Yeah, yeah. Guys, please hurry up! - Hello, where's the patient? - He's inside.
