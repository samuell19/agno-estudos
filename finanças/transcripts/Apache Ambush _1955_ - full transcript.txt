Hey, the war is over. Mr. President, your 7:45 appointment. James Kingston, scout, and Sergeant O'Roarke, Fifth Army Corps, Territory of New Mexico. Good evening, gentlemen. Have you enjoyed the trip to Washington? Well, sir, after the tension of the war, it's a little unnatural being able to relax. Yes. Yes, I've been trying to get used to it myself. I could have written each of you a letter, but I brought you here on this long journey, because I wanted to present one of my problems personally. Well, incidentally, I've had a rather thorough investigation made of each of you. Three years with Crook's army, Mr. Kingston, on the Indian frontier? Yes, sir. Apaches? Morning, noon and night, sir. And you were an active cattle man in Texas before the war, Sergeant? Yes, sir, born right on the range. I know cattle better than people, sir. I want you to help me. Us, sir? How can we possibly help? Gentlemen, trade must be quickly resumed between the states. Meat is so scarce and so high, that people in the North can't afford it. While in Texas, there are thousands and thousands of cattle waiting to be sold in Northern markets. I want that cattle to start moving North at once. I know the obstacles. The lawless elements still bent on keeping the Union apart. I know about the 1,000 miles of dangerous desert country between Texas and Abilene, Kansas. But wouldn't you say it's kind of foolish for people to be starving in a land of plenty with only a thousand miles between them. Well, yes, sir, but with them Apaches still stirring up trouble, it'd take an army to bring them cattle up from Texas. You'll have an army to help you. You can start using the San Arturo soldiers, right away. That might do it. I know that country very well, sir. We could come through Texas, near the lower southeast border of New Mexico, right up the San Arturo. San Arturo could be the halfway station, and from there on to Kansas. And with the soldiers along to give us protection, we could... Make it? Yes, sir. If anybody can.Good. Mr. President, your 8:00 appointment, Major McGuire. This is my second meeting with Major McGuire today, we spent a very pleasant hour together this afternoon. This is James Kingston, Sergeant Tim O'Roarke, both attached to the Union Army. This is Major Donald McGuire, just released from the Confederate Army. The Confederate Army? And he's most welcome here. We have our long wish for peace at last. There's no malice in my heart for those who acted with the courage of their convictions. We want their full support in the future. Mr. President, we Southerners were badly hurt. We trust in God for a United States, once again. Amen to that. From now on, we must all work together. This nation must survive. Now, Major McGuire was born in Texas. He knows the situation, he wants to help. I believe he can move around Texas with more freedom than either of you. Well, I'm from Texas, sir. You're from Texas as of four years ago. And you name is only Timothy. But they tell me they call the Major "Tex", is that right? That's right, sir. That makes a difference. Now Major Tex had as hard a job coming here today, meeting me and talking to me as you're gonna have getting the cattle through. But he came here. He made it. I believe we are very fortunate to have his assistance. Sir, I followed Robert E. Lee in the war. I'll abide by his honorable surrender. Now, if you gentlemen are in agreement, you can further discuss the plans, on your train trip. Sir, that's hard to believe. In fact, it's amazing. You're willing to kill a man in March and in April you're willing to play games with him. We'll work it out together, sir. When are you leaving Washington? We're ready to leave tonight. You, Major? Ready now, sir. We can catch a wagon train due to leave Abilene in two weeks. I'll have to leave you before we reach Abilene. Make different connections to go south. Well, these are the orders for Colonel Marshall as to the use of the soldiers at San Arturo. My letter explains everything. I've requested him to give you complete cooperation, barring any emergency, of course. Excuse me, Mr. President. Mrs. Lincoln is in the carriage, waiting. Oh! Oh, coming right away. I wish we could talk longer, but I promised to visit Ford's Theatre this evening. Hope you enjoy the show, sir. I'm sure I will. We'll make it, sir, you just watch. I'll watch, and I'll also pray. God, grant you a safe journey. You'll be with us on the train for a few days, won't you? Yes, we'll ride into Kansas together. I'll leave you there, and I'll be away down in Texas, long before you reach San Arturo. You'll need that extra time. I calculate I can pick up the men I need, drive the cattle up the border, and I'll meet you just west of Brownfield, two weeks from tomorrow. We'll be there, but in case we're not... Don't even think that. You won't turn back, will you? No, but I'm only half of the team. You'd better show up. We'll be there. I owe you a lot for everything you've done, Sergeant. Ah, you owe me nothing, Red. I'm always glad to help out. And I swear I'll never drink water in Abilene again. Like to rue with my stomach. That serves you right when you could've had whiskey. Oh, not me. I never drink when I got a big train load like this to bring through. Too much responsibility. Sure is a lot of nice people on it. Go on! Yeah, nice till they start talking war and taking sides. Ah, the war's over. It isn't over for them mixed up in the shooting of Mr. Lincoln, is it? Folks will be still fighting this war 100 years from now. You know it's hard to believe, only a few days ago I was talking to Mr. Lincoln. And I sure hope they catch and hang whoever assassinated him. Amen to that. You don't have to baby me any further than this. All right, Bob. I'll be in town in a few hours and I'll bring the soldiers back along before daybreak. Kearny's Pass. Kearny's Pass. Hey. Look yonder, over by that sand hill. Kingston's coming back. Well, Bob will be in San Arturo around midnight, start the escort out to meet us. Yes, sir. This time tomorrow evening, we'll all be home safe and sound. Everything's fine out there. And I wish you'd let me make the trip to town. You're a passenger. I got to protect the passengers. Bob will get there, all right. Brother Bob's a nice fellow. Hey, mister, you're gonna give me a ride in your wagon? What's the matter? Weren't you riding with those folks back there a ways? I'm gonna ask you again, you gonna give me a ride or do I have to walk? Throw up your bag. Didn't like the color of your uniform? You too? Doesn't matter to me. Listen, I've been on three wagons since we left Abilene. They don't like me, I don't like them and their nosy questions. What am I, a freak? What is your name? Parker, Lee Parker. Does it make any difference to you? Polite man. We had a Parker in town. A Silas Parker. He ran the jail. He's my old man. You and your father were on opposite sides, weren't you? What side were you on? I'm a business man. I have a general store in San Arturo. I played both sides. That's nice and cowardly. If you don't like it, you can get off. I am not cowardly. I am from Mexico. Better than the whole north and south put together. You talk too much. You don't like it? No. I don't like it out here. I go and sleep for a while. And do not look inside. I sleep for an hour, maybe two. That's your wife? No. I met her in Abilene. She begged for a ride to San Arturo. Has friends there, she says. Better or for worse, the war is over. Never be over for me. Two years in their army prisons, they didn't have to take this on, they could have saved it. Yankees. Maybe the Indians have given up attacking on this road. This close to town, we're more likely to run into Jironza and his raiders. Why don't that Mexican stay on his own side of the border? That critter don't believe in borders. He claims that Texas and New Mexico belongs to his country. Well, ain't there enough land around here for everybody? Not according to Joaquin Jironza. That fellow ahead, riding up front by the lead wagon... You mean Kingston? I hear he's gonna use soldiers to bring up cattle from Texas. Southern cattle for the Yankees. Yeah. Southern cattle. Interesting, isn't it? What are we supposed to do? Lay down like dogs and give everything we own to the north? What's the matter with those Texans? People from Texas aren't laying down, nor are a lot of others in this territory. Ah, you're just dreaming out loud. Lee's surrendered. What can anyone do now? We're doing it. We? Just where do you stand, mister? Come and see me after you've been home with your family for a few days. I'll tell you then. Rosita, welcome home! What did you think? You played the wrong cards. Jironza still here? Jironza! I wonder if you will ever get here? You take your time to come back to me, eh? You sent me somewhere to find something for you, I had to take my time. But I find them. The guns? With Calvin? Si! I meet him in Abilene, like you tell me. I follow him like a kitten for one, two, three days. Then... I make him like me, like you tell me. Si, si, it's all right, like I told you. Then what? He buy many guns. Very secret. The kind you tell me. Repeating rifles? Si. Henry Repeating rifles. How many? Where are they? They fire 10, 12 shots without a stop. Maybe more. I see him buy them, but I could not count to write. I promised you we would have them. The best rifle in the country. The newest. Better than the army has. How many? I do not know. I could not count to write. But perhaps 100. Oh, many boxes. Which is Calvin's wagon? It's number seven from the front. But you cannot go. No? A man ride to town to get the soldiers to meet wagons. The soldiers will be ready, will kill. You do not believe me? Look over there, Chiquita. Si, that is him, the man who ride to town. There will be no soldiers. They ain't got guns on them wagons. She lies to you. She lies! Then ask him why he heard I had to get soldiers? To have them protect the wagon train from the Apaches. No guns on wagons. Just people. Now we go for the guns. You... You don't have to. You have a deal with Calvin to share them. That was to get them this far. What has Calvin got to do with me now? With us? I do not need him anymore. Well, the soldiers will be expecting this wagon train, and come out to meet it. Soldiers wait for word. Bailey, you always afraid. Well, there's no need to go looking for a bullet. If bullet is for you, it will find you. I go for only one wagon. I know the one. The new guns are for me, understand? Everything else is for you. Horses, food, white women. Get to your people. We will meet at Kearny's Pass. Now, we can do something for my country. Ah! I forget, I have nice fat present from that Calvin. He will be very mad, the pig. Maybe I kill the pig. Get ready! We leave. Kearny's Pass, and no sign of the army. They'll show up any minute now. She stole all my money too, little rotten little fergauge. Think she found the rifles? No, those guns are between you and me, do you hear? Look, Mr. Calvin, you ain't making no mistake with me. I got lots of friends, north, south and west. Before we're through, Texas will stretch all the way to California. Quite nice beginning, eh? Where's that soldier? Where's Bob? I'm gonna use these rifles. I don't want them found. You want to live, don't you? They mustn't find them. I'll lose them. You want to get scalped? Where's the cartridge? Here. Repeaters. Who's got repeating rifles in this outfit? I don't know, listen. Where did he anybody get repeaters? The army can't even get them. I'm coming with you. Get more men in here, we can't hold this off by ourselves. You get them. We got to take that wagon. The guns are there. Pig. These Henrys haven't been issued to the army yet. I don't know where he got them. Do you? No. Riding with him, and yet you don't know anything about these. I told you I don't know nothing about them, didn't I? I'll get someone to drive the wagon. I don't need any help. But what about... I told you I don't need help. I'll drive Calvin's wagon. They're coming back? Not tonight. Not against these. I saw some whites. Does anyone here know or see Jironza? Most of us are strangers. They got Jennings, the wagon master. They got Red? Should have stayed with him. Don't start blaming yourself for anything. Were lucky we're alive. How many more? Can't tell yet. We got a lot of wounded. Bring the dead into town. We're moving on, O'Roarke. Everybody on their wagon. We're moving on. One of them white raiders, Mr. Kingston. He's still alive. O'Roarke! Yo. You didn't see Jironza leading those men, did you? Who? I don't know who you are talking about. I just brought my family out here from Michigan. This is the first renegade we've taken alive. Maybe we can get something out of him. Take him into town and be careful. I'll be careful. Come on. O'Roarke, I mean it. All right, but after he talks, he's mine. Come on, you. Let's get moving. Hurry it up. What good are you soldiers? What are you here for? You ain't protecting them settlers. We were to get word if they were coming in. Perhaps the Apache should have sent you a letter. We've had patrols out. Out where? Where the Indians ain't? Let the Southerners rot, that's your motto. You rebels never give up, do you? That's right, we ain't going to. The war is over, you lost. Get him, buddy. Come on, get him. Oh, get out of here. Go kill yourself someplace else. You too. I'm going over to headquarters. What do I do with the wounded and the dead? Grab a burial detail. Get the wounded over to the jail and have them tended to. Hi, Kingston. Rough trip, huh? We got through. Jim! You and O'Roarke came in on that wagon train? Why didn't you send us word? We sent Bob Jennings, Red's brother. Never got here. Neither did Red, alive. Colonel, a whole lot's happened since we left Washington. But as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Lincoln is still alive. At least that's the way I always want to remember him. Here's his letter. It explains the job we have to do. Now what? We're to bring all the cattle we can from Texas to Kansas. What? Nothing to it. Read the letter. You think it was Jironza that raided you last night? Mostly Indians, but there were some whites. Oh, we managed to capture one of the wounded. He's over at the jail. Oh, let's take a look. Remember Hank Calvin, the man who ran the store over on the other street? Yeah, went to Abilene, two wagon trains back. He was killed last night. He was bringing in nearly 100 of those Henry rifles with him. The new ones? The new Repeaters, the best. Sixteen shots without reloading. They saved our lives. Where are they now? In his wagon. I'll take them over fast! Sergeant O'Roarke. Colonel Marshall, sir. Glad to see you again, Sergeant. These all the wounded? Yes, sir, except the prisoner, he's inside. What about the dead? We left them over on the hill. I got a burial detail. They're digging the graves for them. Hello, Miss Parker. Hello, Colonel. Your prisoner's still unconscious, Colonel. I'll see him in a minute. I'm so glad you're back. So am I, and all in one piece. Hello, Mr. Jim.Manuel. You are safe. So far. Very happy to see you. I'll send over a couple of men to help you with the night watch. I... I don't know how this happened, Colonel. We watched him all the time. Yeah, you watched him so well that someone stuck a knife in his back to keep his mouth shut. You left him alone, Manuel. He's dead? But... But, how could that be? Couldn't be Jironza, would it? I do not know Jironza. I only hate him. Please, senor Coronel, Jironza has not the real heart for my country. I believe he's a crazy man. About as crazy as a well-trained fox. Let's look at Calvin's wagon. Will you be back? Yes, Ann. Come on, Jim. This town's like a stick of dynamite, just ready to be lit. Who was that, a Confederate General? He was on Calvin's wagon, drove it in for me. He had a chip on his shoulder then, and I guess it's still there. A Confederate on Calvin's wagon with the new guns? You handle that detail. Did you take possession of those Repeating rifles? Me? Well, no sir, they was Calvin's property. I parked his wagon behind his store. Well, I thought that'd be the right thing... Well, it wasn't! And get that body out of there! Yes, sir. Not a sign of them. This I don't understand. You will if they're ever turned against us. That one armed kid... With the chip on his shoulder, what do you think he'll tell you? Pardon me, Colonel. Do you want something else from my wagon? Your wagon? Hank Calvin was my partner. I put up half the money. And I expect you to return the Repeating rifles, Colonel. You expect me to what? I'm here looking for those rifles. Where are they? I don't know. Your men moved them last. You better find them, they're mine. Bought and paid for. We'll talk to you later. You certainly will. You better let me handle this. Why? How far do you think that uniform will get you with that boy? I don't know how far any of us are going to get around here, unless we locate those guns. By now, probably every southern hot-head has one hidden. I'll wait for you at headquarters. Read Mr. Lincoln's letter. O'Roarke and I are leaving here tonight. Tonight? You can't leave... I'll question the boy, but finding the rifles is your problem. I've got a bigger one with the cattle. Well, anyway, Lee's back home, Annie. Lee's back home. What you do with those rifles? What did it do? I left them in the wagon. You're lying, you... Wait a minute! Jim! You ain't nothing but a little... Jim! He's my brother. Your brother? He's been gone four years. I should have told you... Why didn't you tell him? Were you afraid you'd lose him? You ashamed 'cause I fought for what I believed in? Ashamed 'cause I rotted in his prisons? You Yankees did this to me, aren't you satisfied yet? Forget your hates, Lee. The war is over. You're home now. Son, you don't believe that the south is lost... Get your hands of me! Can't we talk about this later? I'm sure the boy will... Stop defending me. Stop picking on me. Look, 100 Henry Repeater rifles in Calvin's wagon. You drove that wagon here and you were the last one to be seen with the wagon. Now where are the rifles? Leave me alone. Leave me alone, will ya. Lee, if you know where they are, you should tell him. What, has my whole family turned Yankee? Listen, I don't know where they are, but if they can be used to run you Yankees out of this town, then I'll die happy. I have to report this to the Colonel. Ann, O'Roarke and I are leaving tonight for Texas to bring some cattle back. Tonight? But, Jim, you just got here. I'll see you later. "I assure you that your help will mean the difference between success and failure. "Yours for peace in our beloved country. Very sincerely, A. Lincoln." It's very fine of Mr. Lincoln to make these suggestions, but I've got miles and miles of territory to police with only 300 troops. I'm really worried about who's got those rifles. We could lock up everyone we suspect. The jail won't be large enough. No, Jim, I won't move out my soldiers until they are found. Then you are turning down Mr. Lincoln. What else can I do? His letter allows me to use my own judgment in case of an emergency. This town is it. The civil war is still hot, right here. You don't need the whole troop. I'm not going to move out with you and come back and find half the people around here slaughtered. All right, you can have 75 men. Well, 75 is 75. Yes, sir. We'll need your best riders and some of them ex-cowboys that you... Yes, sir. Seventy-five men, sir. Someday it's gonna be wonderful just to be able to sit back in a rocking chair and not have to worry about Apaches, patrols, cattle, Jironza. Send Sergeant Federman in. If we leave after dark, I can keep my Texas border date right on time. My men will be ready. Federman, I want you to detach 75 men from regular duty, assign them to Mr. Kingston. Good riders, men who can handle cattle. Did you say cattle, sir? Men leave for Texas tonight. Also issue extra arms, provisions... Dispatch rider just brought this. He's being riding all night. Well, no one is gonna like this. Bad news for you too, Jim. Orders to abandon San Arturo post immediately. Immediately, sir? Within an hour upon receipt of these orders. Why? Where? We're moving to the Mexican border, there's rioting and looting going on down there. March out with your guns loaded. Well, we'll have action, sir. We'll have action here when we pull out. Mexican border, huh? Yes, our destination is to be kept secret, but if anyone asks, we may be back any day. Yes, sir. Federman, forget about assigning those men to Mr. Kingston. Yes, sir. But I need them, Colonel, and you said you wouldn't leave this place unprotected. I don't want to, but I can't disobey these orders. But you already have orders. In Mr. Lincoln's own handwriting. Orders from the secretary of war, Mr. Kingston. Only two minutes old to me, but they were started on their way the day before yesterday. I can't fight a live secretary of war with a dead president's letter. Sorry, Jim. I've got to pack. Can you spare me 50? Thirty? 20 men? Do you want me to get shot? The whole troop moves out. What about me, sir? Now wait a minute... You haven't arrived here yet. He's on special leave for a special job. Well, I guess I can spare O'Roarke. I haven't seen him yet, neither have you. Thanks. Jim, I can't help it. What are you gonna do? I'm sorry, sir. I haven't arrived here yet. I've got to keep my emergency plans a secret. Why you no find out about the guns? I heard no talk about them. Stop, I finished Bailey for you, didn't I? I don't care about Bailey. What he do to hurt me? Tell them what I look like. You think they come and get me? We get the new guns. We get the town. We get the whole territory. Nobody lives, except Jironza wants them to live. No north. No south. Joaquin, there was a kid in the wagon with Calvin. Yeah, I saw him, only one arm. Maybe he take the rifles. Oh, how could he? Wait, maybe he could. Only one arm, yet he was driving. He was driving? Yeah. All alone. We go find the kid. Si! Get out of town! Good riddance! Get out of here, and don't come back. God bless you, hurry back. You a Yankee lover? They won the war, didn't they? Did they? Hey! Why don't you get out of town, with the rest of them? You, too, if you know what's good for you. Beat it! Oh, yeah, who you telling to beat it, Sergeant. O'Roarke! Come on! Get the horses and everything you need behind the cantina. I'll meet you there an hour after sun down. You can depend on me. And play it safe. Get rid of the uniform. Will do. We very lucky, eh? Soldiers leave. That is good for us. You go into the town. Find the kid. You find the guns. Come back here. We wait. You think I find the guns just like that? I don't care how, querida mia. But find them. Si? Not now, go tonight when it is dark, little one. About ready, Tim? About ready. You took so long, I thought you was a-marrying the girl. I wish I could. That might be one sure way of making a widow out of here, after this trip. Tim. Yeah! I'm not going with you. What? There's no sense in bringing cattle to a town that's likely to be taken over. There's not going to be any town when we get here. You can reach McGuire, as easily as both of us. If there's going to be trouble, why don't I stay and you go along? No, that's got to be the other way around. You keep our Texas border date with McGuire, as we promised, just outside of Brownfield. Then start right back. I need a couple of more hours here and then I'll follow. Good luck! Good luck? Well, you keep my share, you're going to need it worse than me. I'll be along. I'll be watching for you. Come on, boy. Find Lee? No, he may be up in the hills. It's awful quiet in town. Everybody's disappeared like rats in a hole. I found about 20 extra men we can rely on. That won't be enough. Senores. I just seen some men go over to Traeger's stable, one at a time. Calvin's partner. Traeger's been trying to organize this town, for the south. They so quiet, they sneak along like thieves. Let's get over there.Yeah. Okay, we've waited for those rifles, now where are they? You'll get them, but don't go shouting about it. Just because the army left town, don't get the idea we're not going to have a fight. Kingston is out there with plenty of support. He's the first one I'm going to get. There's one thing sure, they're not going to drive any cattle through this town. I just want to feel one of those Repeater's right here in my hands. Traeger hid them. I'd drove them out of here, if it wasn't for Traeger. The army searched everywhere. Everywhere but where we buried them. You got them buried? And where do you suppose? The graveyard? Nope. You'll never guess. We got them buried right... Get their guns! Let me go! I took care of him. Do you know where the rifles are? Where you'll never find them. Why don't you stop fighting me? Fight Jironza! Are all of you people blind? Just get out of town, we'll deal with Jironza. You mean he'll deal with you. He's out there right now, backed by his Apaches. Waiting for us to kill each other off. So that he can come in here and get the guns and everything else he wants. We know what we are doing. Do you? Do you realize you're setting this up to kill off half the people in town? And all because you won't talk. I'll make him talk. Big hero, aren't you? This is no time to be soft, we'll kill him if we have to. Get up! Get up! Stop it! Stop it, stop it, do you hear me, stop it! Get away from the boy. And you're not going to hurt him anymore. And drop the guns, all of you. There's horses outside. Go on son, get out of town. You're wrong on what you're doing, but they're not going to hurt you anymore. Keep him here, he's our only chance. Go on! There's a horse outside, hurry. And nobody's going after him. When it's time you can do what you want to, to me, but you're not going to hurt my boy anymore. You deserve whatever happens now. Senor Lee! I see, I hear everything. I can help you. What are you doing here? I come from Jironza. Jironza? You have no time now, come with me. You ran out on Calvin. Si. And I know all about the guns. But now I am your friend. It is good. You come with me. All right. Just stay right where you are, a little longer. Dad! That shot... Too late. You'll never catch him in the dark. They were beating Lee, and I let him go. Beating him? Yes, they'd have killed him. You let them beat Lee? Forget he's your brother, Ann. He's the only one can tell us where those rifles are, and he wouldn't talk. You'll just have to keep searching. Keep searching. What's it all for? Friend against friend. What... What have we been doing? Can we have our guns back? Come morning, I'm riding out to meet the cattle and help bring them through. You'll get your guns then. Maybe we all better start looking for them rifles, together. Yes, maybe we'd better, together. Nothing's here. Not a sign of them. Nothing's here. Let's go inside. No guns, not even the boxes. Not a sign of them. I'll never understand how they could disappear like this. Nothing here. There's no other place to look. There are many men in the town, maybe they find the guns. You think they'd do this to me if they know where they are? I'm the only one that knows. So you come to tell me. I didn't come to tell you. I was brought here. Why should I tell you? Because I am a friend of the south. Calvin was southern. You knew he was bringing in rifles, you still attacked the wagon train. I didn't know Calvin was there. All I do is try to help the Apaches. They are my friends. With those rifles, I can do a lot for your side. More than you alone. You need me and maybe the wrong people find the guns. Maybe you're right. Anyway, I don't have much of a choice right now. Then we go together to town? All right, I'll show you where the rifles are, if you promise me two things. Number one, you stop the cattle drive. Coming from where? I did not know. They're bringing in a lot of southern cattle from Texas to feed the Yankees. They mustn't get through. No, that would be bad for us. Well, can you do anything about it? You've got a lot of men here. Chandler! Yeah! I can do very good. Where do you want my friends, the Apaches, to stop the cattle? Will they? If I say so. All right, you stop them right where they raided the wagon train. Kearny's Pass, tomorrow afternoon. You heard. Yeah, Kearny's Pass. Go to Chief Apaho. Tell him soldiers gone from San Arturo. Tell him I say all cattle are for Apache people. Go now! Make no mistake! Now, what is the other promise? It's about a lot of southerners, still in town. I saw what happened. I know they're going to be unarmed. I don't want you to shoot at them. Of course not, that is easy promise. They are all my friends. My father and my sister. They will be safe with Jironza. You show your father to me, and your sister too. I go too? You stay here. We be back. We got to get into town quietly. Any luck? Nothing! Find Kingston. I'll never understand how they could disappear like this. I'm ready to give up. They could be out of town, you know. How could they? Not a wagon left before we started searching. We've been through and under everything. We searched the whole town, I think. They've got to be somewhere. They didn't have much time to hide, maybe inside Calvin's store? We've torn the place apart. Well, they too smart for us. All right fellas, call it off. And thanks! "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High "shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. "I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, "my guide, in Him, will I trust." You don't have to say anything. I know. Silly, wasn't it? How's your father? He won't talk. Nothing. He knows what he's done. Jim, I wish I could help you. I wish somebody could. Jironza's bound to know the army's gone. With your brother out there somewhere and the rifles still here, anything can happen. This is Calvin's wagon! Manuel! Fraser! By God, I have found the rifles. Get the shovel. All the time, right there under the wagon. They said they had buried them. How'd you find them? Luck! Crazy cockeyed luck! Kingston, where are our guns? Jironza, no, no, no... You're murdering southerners! Jironza, you said you wouldn't! What do I care? I'll kill all of them. Lee! I was wrong! I believed Jironza. Tell Kingston, Jironza's sending Apaches to stop the cattle at Kearny's Pass. Let me go! Let me go! Stop it! Please don't! Stop it! Both Lee and my father dead! Oh, Jim! Why did it have to be? Who knows the answer to wars and hatreds? Lee said to tell Kingston, Jironza's sending Apaches to stop the cattle. We've got to get help to O'Roarke. No, stay here, Jim! It's too late. Did he say where? Kearny's Pass. Come on! We can take them through Kearny's Pass. He ain't there, I hate to think of what happened. Charlie! Get them straight and back. Tighten up your point. Jironza, good friend. Make big present. Many cattle come. My people hungry. Fight men, take all cattle. All? Everything! Where this be? Kearny's Pass, go now, hurry! You ride with us. I ride with you. Hey, Tex! O'Roarke! Huh? Party of men coming. How many? Eight... Ten... They're sure right. Sure is good to see you! Yeah, it's good to see both of you. I hear you had some trouble at San Arturo. That's over with now, but Jironza got word to the Apaches about the cattle. He did? With this dust they can't miss it. We'll keep right on moving. You better send a couple of riders ahead to scout. It's too late for that! Look over here! Heading into the right flank. Keep the cattle from scattering. They're stampeding them. Turn them back! Turn them back into the Indians! Turn them back! Wheel them! Wheel them back into the Indians! I've never seen cattle turn so pretty! It's a good trick when it works. Let's hope they don't come back. I don't think they will. Ain't likely, not with their Chief dead. Well, let's get organized and move on. Ride into town. We're not even stopping for chow. Take over, Sergeant. We're only stopping till morning, Ann. You're going on through to Abilene? That's my promise. But I'll be back. I'll be waiting.
