--== McEphie ==-- Leaving so soon? Yeah, I'm in a hurry. I'm meeting an investor for my project. How about this room? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Just walk out the lobby when you leave, okay? I'll leave these here. Hi, babe. What? You're twenty thousand short. You were late. Next time, don't waste my time. Damn it! Hello, Aljur. Ma'am Elise, your friends are here. Are you coming over? Yes. You got stock? Of course! You're a lifesaver. See you. Bye. Hi, sissies! She's here! - Have you ordered? - Have you? Of course not. I don't have money. My treat. Really? That's fabulous! I love it! I like this. This is yours. Thanks. Keep the change. That's my tip. That's why I like you. Thanks. What's that? Vitamins. What else? Okay. I like that! You're such a high roller. Got a juicy gig? Yes, but we're still on a budget. My guest cut me short. You were okay with it? She was gone when I found out. You shouldn't spend all of your cash. You'd just get a mouthful from your mom again. Then you'd call me crying. Don't mind her. Forget that. It's her treat. Babe... Could you be that generous too? Of course, babe. Anything for you. - What a flirt! - Stop flirting! You know the feeling! For sure, Elise will bug me later when her mom nags her. That won't happen. - We're just happy tonight. - That's right! - Cheers! - Cheers! Look behind you, sis. Bet he wants to make you happier. Go, sis! Go now. Go, sis! Happy pussy! Go! Let's party! Excuse me. You're so good! Shit. Ma... Ma, I don't wanna go. Ma... Just go. Go on, now. Go! Ma! Hey, you need to wake up. Wake up. Hey. Good morning. Shit. I drank a lot last night. What's your name again? Dennis. But... Last night... you called me Marcus. Sorry. So, Dennis… You really need to go. Right. My head hurts. Where's my phone? Shit. You're not giving your number, are you? I'm sure we'll run into each other soon. Let's hang out again. Will you be here tomorrow? I can swing by. No. We're good. Go now. How rude to snub me like that. Good morning, Ma! You bring home different guys every single night. So what? No food yet? I couldn't sleep last night with all your noise. Pervert! You think our neighbors couldn't hear your moans last night? What if Christian finds out? Where will we go? Don't worry, Ma. I bribed the guards at the gate. Okay? You should have paid me instead. I could use that money. What a way to start the day. Christian's coming over tonight. He wants to have me alone. I'll leave then. Give me money later. I'll give you ten thousand later. What? Not enough. I've just given you 50,000. All gone. What did you do? Did you gamble again? As if you've earned that money. I'm your mother. I raised you, took care of you. It's payback time. Wow! Since I was 11, I've been taking care of you. I can only give you ten thousand later. The remainder next time. I'm disappointed at you. You rarely visit. I'm sorry, babe. I've been so busy. With whom? A new favorite? Babe... You're my only favorite. Just busy with my upcoming trip. You're leaving again. To where? We're opening a Japanese restaurant at the capitol. We'll be in Osaka for about a month for research with the investors. Don't sulk. I will not let you down. I'll have my assistant deposit to your account 200 thousand next week. Pay your bills. Would that be enough? Babe, thing is… What is it? Never mind. What? Mama has a kidney disease. She needs surgery. That could cost a lot. How much? 300 thousand to 400 thousand. That's for a private hospital. They said it's more expensive here in Manila. Okay. I will deposit it next week. Go ahead with the operation. Thank you, babe. - Hello sis? - Michelle. Let's go out. Sure. What's the plan? Just meet me at our regular spot. No problem. I'll be there. Sure. See you. Hopefully, you get to pick one. Let's see. How about him? Average. Choosy! The other one? So-so. - Hi! This is Neil. - Hi! He's premium, excellent! - Bro! - I'll leave them to you. - Alright. - Just order. What's your name? Elise. How long have you been working here? I've just started. You look like a big shot. You're a regular here? Whenever I feel like it. Oh? What's your work? Same as yours. But I'm pricier. We're classmates then! Why go here then? I want to try getting served. Joey said you're excellent. It's for you to find out. Where have you been? Where else? Had a guest. You thought I wouldn't know you're paying for guys? Early sermon again. I know what I'm doing, Ma. Give me money. I gave you ten thousand yesterday. I told you that won't be enough. I was right! Your Aunt Shiela brought me to that new casino. I took a gamble and had a good time. I spent everything. I also borrowed money so I need to return it. Ma! I'm not working my ass off for you to splurge on gambling. I'm not splurging. I just tried it. If you won't quit, I'll just cut you off! How will I pay up your Aunt Shiela? Work your ass off so you could earn money. I don't want to work. I'm too old for that. How about when I was 11? Was I not too young to be sold to an old man? But look how rich we are now. Damn it! All you think about is money! So what? Without money, where would we be? Nowhere! You're enjoying all of these anyway. You give service and you get serviced. If you don't like this, then quit! But you can't. You're used to being wealthy. You can't bear being poor! And don't you dare curse me, you asshole! Screw you, bitch! I'm your mother. I'm your mother. Yes, I'm just your child, but who pays for everything here? Who sells her body so we can live this life? You're my mother but you're still a freeloader! Do you want me to thank you? Alright, thank you! Thank you for selling the kid you had instead of looking for a job! Thank you, Ma, for letting different men use my body! Thank you for this damn life! Get out of this house! I don't want to see you anymore! This is enough! I'm fed up with you! Get out and leave me alone! What a fool! You want me to leave? Fine. I kicked my mother out. Seriously? I'm so tired of her. Congrats! Finally you came to your senses! Wait… She kicked her own mother out? Is that the right thing? Why not? She's just milking Elise. Her mother pushed her! Michelle, that's enough. Sorry, sis. She's a parasite! Her mother's sitting pretty while Elise is doing the hard work. Is she a capitalist? What's that? Hairspray? No. Air freshener for your bad mouth. Shut up now. Relax. Let's take a shot. Let's enjoy. Cheers! I'll just grab a drink. - Elise! - Marcus! Hi. How are you? It's good to see you. Long time! Yeah… Right. Sis, Marcus. My high school classmate. - Marcus. - Michelle. How have you been? Who are you with? I'm fine. Just passing by. I'm a marketing... Marketing partner of the gym's owner. Wow. Sounds grand. Not a big deal. How about you? You look the same, and you look good. What have you been up to? She's also into marketing… Online stuff... She markets herself... She does marketing work online. - Digital marketing. - Yes, digital marketing. Nice. That's nice. Well, I gotta run. Can I get your number though? To catch up? I'll do it. Forgive my friend. She's just shy. It's good to see you. See you soon. Is that him? Is that him? What now? Did Marcus call you? He's been calling and messaging but I've been ignoring him. So fussy! Give yourself a chance for true love. What if he discovers what I do? No more true love by then. Whatever! Talk to you later. Okay, bye! Babe… I thought you're coming back next month. Babe, are you okay? Babe… You're bringing different guys… In this house I'm paying for. Who told you that? You know I want you all by myself. I gave you everything. Do I deserve this? That's not true. Shit! You think I'm a moron?! Where are you going? Screw you! Don't be scared. Don't be scared. No one will hurt you. Stop crying. I'm not going anywhere. I'm just here. What if someone heard us? After this. We need to go somewhere. Tear it apart. Not a single trace. What happened? Just do it. Let's go. Where are you off to? I'll see Michelle. Not allowed. I told you to stay away from your friends. You know Michelle. She's nice. Regardless. Why? Can they do what I do for you? Can they kill for you? Your Aunt Shiela is collecting. Give me money. I barely have any. We're dry on funds, you imbecile. Go back to the Congressman. He has tons of money. Quit drinking and doping. Listen. I'm your mother. I know what's best for you. Those friends you have? They don't. Who did that to you? Christian? Your mother? What? Damn it, Elise! Why don't you say it? Did your mother do that? I'll call the cops on her. Come on! The disappearance of businessman Christian Lopez His wife asks the public to report any lead to the police. Why are you here? The police visited me. They're asking about the car. Someone saw it at the shop… right before I disassembled it. What did you say? Let's talk inside. Lock the gate. I hope you don't mind, I'm cooking. What did the police say? I said I don't know anything. They'll be back for sure. What should I say? Looks like the owner's a big fish. Bet I could get more out of them. Wait a sec. How much do you want? 300 thousand. For now. For now? Yeah, for n... Eat your food. Eat up, asshole. Who's that? No one. Just a client. Then pick it up. I'm tired. Meet up. We can't afford getting tired. Here. We're out of cash. Hey. How are you? Have a seat. How are you now? I should ask you that. Living it big now? I need to tell you something. I'm not a marketing partner of the gym's owner. When you saw me... I was in a hurry that time because I'm just a messenger. Bet you're better off than I am. Elise. I'm sorry. For what? For what I did... back in high school. Tell me what happened. Heard of some things about me? I was so confused. But... I'm glad we met again. And... If you don't mind… I'll make it up to you. About time. Excuse me. That guy's familiar. Do I know him? What are you doing here? We need to go somewhere. But I can take care of it. Just give me five thousand. Take care. I'm heading off now. Go ahead. Are you alright? Thank you. For what? Nothing. I enjoyed being with you. Me too. I forgot to tell you something. What? Never mind. Sorry. Maybe next time. Hi. Hey. You're still awake. I was wondering when I can see you again. I need to run some errands with my mother. I see. Your mother again. I'll text you. Okay. Miss you. Bye. Who's that? A client. Sure? Does he pay well? Just enough. That's right. Let them pay. I've got all these men figured out. I know their every move. Before they do anything to you... I'll make the first move. You know what I'm capable of, right? Ma... What if I quit escorting? What? I'll look for a better job. A decent one. What else can you do? I'll give it a try. You can't do anything else. You're just a pretty face. All you can do is fuck and play around with old men. That's the only thing you're good at. I can't take it any longer. I can't forget about what happened. What if you end up nowhere? What would you do? Only money can wipe tears and exhaustion away. While everybody else dreams of the impossible, we've flown beyond our own dreams. I can't afford to lose it all. Someone texted. Answer. There you go. I love you. Go now. Move. What were you thinking, letting this burglar in? Look, he took all your money. Damn, you never learn. Let's clean this up. Do it. Hey. What's up? You're not answering. Elise, are you okay? What? Elise, wait. What's happening to you? Please answer me. What don't I understand? I can't take this anymore! It's Mama… Elise, calm down. Just wait. I'll be there. Okay? Okay, okay. Bye. Where are you going? To my client. How much are you charging? 350 thousand. Is that Marcus? He's my client. Where's the money? What? You haven't shown me a single cent from him. That guy never pays. He's not your client, is he? I'm just saving them before I hand to you. I know well enough when you lie. You know that. Why still do it? Liar. Hello, Michelle. Have you talked to Elise? Not yet. I spoke to her last a few days ago. Why? I'm not sure, but there's something going on with her. I'm coming for her now. Alright. I'll try to reach her as well. Okay. Bye. Elise? Elise?! Elise? Elise? Elise?! Are you there? Elise? Elise?! Elise! Ma, please? Don't hurt him. Have mercy! Shut up! Those bastards are the reasons why you're a mess with your life! Elise... Elise, what's going on? Elise. Elise is no longer here. I tucker her to sleep. Elise, what's happening to you? I told you, Elise is not here. She's sleeping now. Elise… I was right about you. Aren't you the guy who left my child without warning? Do you realize the pain you've caused her? I really don't understand why my daughter goes crazy over guys who just hurts her. Asshole, you think I'm a moron?! You all just make a fool out of her. I'm so fed up with all of you! But no matter what happens... I'll never get tired of protecting her. Though no matter how much I remind her... she never believes me that you couldn't handle the truth... when you hear about all the dirty things she's done. And in your eyes... she'll be nothing but a whore. Marcus… What did Mama do to you?! Please stop. Stop, Elise! Stop, Elise! What you made my daughter feel is far worse than this. Elise? Elise… Elise! Elise! Elise! What are you doing? Elise! Marcus! Hurry up! Hurry! Elise! Elise! Elise? Elise... Elise! Elise! Elise! What are you doing? Ma, I can't take it anymore. I've been used by so meny men... whom I don't even love. - Elise! - Let me go away with Marcus! When he finds out the truth, he will just leave you. You'll come back to me. You will only get hurt. Our life will be better. We just have to trust each other, I've been there, believe me. Then why are you letting me suffer this? Nobody would love me now. Me. I will. I'm here for you. I won't leave you. Everyone else will leave but me. Ma, I don't want this anymore… Elise, stop it! Elise, stop it! Give that to me. Elise, stop it! Stop it, Elise! Elise, stop it! Stop! Elise used to hurt herself as a child. She got exploited at a very young age. She couldn't take it in. But she still loved her mother just the same… despite blaming her mother for her own misery. But then again, there's this one instance when she was 16. She had a breakdown. And she killed her mother. That was very traumatizing for her. That triggered her Dissociative Identity Disorder. Her mother personality takes over without any warning. Up until now, she has no idea her mother's dead. Tear it apart. Leave no trace. What happened? Excuse me. I can accompany you to her but you can't approach her. She's considered a very dangerous patient. Mama?
