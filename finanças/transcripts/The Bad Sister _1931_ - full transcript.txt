Morning, Mr Madison. Hello Freddy. How's business? Just fine. Saved up enough to buy a new catcher's mitt. Good. Wait a minute. Get yourself a new baseball, too. Ah gee. Say, thanks Mr Madison. Thanks a lot. - Forget it. Hedrick up yet, Laura? He's up alright. I tipped him out of bed. Good for you, He's been late for school twice this week. Morning, Minnie. Breakfast ready? I'm doing the best I can. I only got two hands. Alright, alright, alright. Won't be long. Hungry, John? - You bet. Oh, Minnie. You might go up and waken Marianne. Be sure you do it gently. You know how nervous she is. Yes, ma'am. I found that out. Be sure and make 'em nice and brown, will you mother. I've been making them brown for 27 years. Ah! Morning, Minnie. - You little rotter. Frightening the daylights out of a person so early in the morning. Well, why don't you look where you're going? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. And if I was your mother .. I'd take you over my knee and whack the daylights out of you. Oh you would, would you? I'd just like to see you .. Breakfast is ready. Hello, Minnie. Oh dear, I don't think I'm a bit well this morning. Then you don't want no breakfast? Wait a minute, Minnie. Perhaps a little breakfast would be good for me. Will you bring it up to me on a tray, like a darling. Not me, I won't. I ain't hired to run up and down stairs for the likes of you. Minnie, you are being impertinent. - Ha. There. - How dare you. Why, you're nothing but a stupid, common, ignorant .. Don't you call me no names. I don't have to stand for nothing from you. Ha. Hmm, it certainly do smell good, mother. Ha. Minnie, where you going? Home. - What's the matter? I'm just as good as she is and maybe better. She can't insult me in the way and get away with it. You mean to say you've upset Miss Marianne again? Upset her? Ha. I'd like to let her have one. Ah, come on now, Minnie. Don't let it throw you. Marianne don't mean no harm and I'm sure you don't neither. Oh, I don't see why a poor girl has to take insults. Just because she has to go out and earn her own living. There, there now Minnie. Don't worry, everything will be fixed up. Well. Alright. This once. But the next time .. - There won't be any next time. Well, alright, Mr Madison. I'll be bringing them in. Well young man, you've finally decided to get up, eh? Sure. Hey Minnie! How about my pancakes? If you yell like that I won't give you nothing. Please, dear Minnie. May I have some pancakes? I'm not cooking them. Thank you. There is the mail. I'll get it. Hello, Hedrick. Good morning, Mr Riley. - There you are. Hey! There is something on your heel. No, the other one. Ah, go on with you. There. Thank you Minnie, darling. John, here is a letter from Amy. What did she say? Be quiet and let mother read it. Don't you want me to be interested in my own sister? Hedrick. No bad news, mother? Ben has lost his job. I always said he was dumb. - Shush. Oh, what a pity. And the baby coming any time now. They are coming here to live. Until Sam gets on his feet. But they got no other place to go. Oh well. We'll get along somehow. Good morning, Daddy. - Good morning. Hello Mumsy. - Hello dear. Hello, Laura. - Morning. Oh Minnie, Miss Marianne is here. What am I supposed to do, celebrate? Young man. [ Slurping noises ] For heaven's sake Hedrick, can't you make less noise. I was doing an imitation. Didn't you get it? Get what? I was doing an immigration of the way you sounded last night .. When you was kissing on the front porch. Little liar. I ain't a liar. I thought Wade left before we went to bed. He did. Well then, who was ..? I thought you and Wade were practically engaged. What? Wade and I engaged? I should say not. Can you imagine me married to that big .. He's very successful. He's got the biggest insurance business in town. Who was on the front porch with you last night? I'll tell you who it was. It was Dick Lindley. And he asked her to marry him too. Dick? Well I never. Is it true? Are you engaged to Dick? Nobody said I was engaged. He asked me to marry him. My goodness, a girl must do something for excitement in this one-horse town. Well, got to be getting down to the office. Goodbye, everybody. - Goodbye. Oh Daddy. Daddy. - What? You've just got to give me fifty dollars. Fifty dollars? What for? Oh they are having the most marvellous sale at Overmeyers. Dresses for fifty dollars. Reduced from $97. It's such a bargain. I'd like to, Marianne. I just can't afford it. I haven't got it. Please, Daddy. I know but Amy and Sam are coming back on our hands now and I've got to .. So they are coming back? I see. Plenty of money for Amy and Sam and everybody in this family but me. I never have a thing. I'm actually ashamed to go places. Well, if you want as bad as all that I guess I can manage. Stop in the office. I'll give it to you. - Thanks, Daddy. You are an angel. Yes. Bye. Darling, Wade is downstairs. - Wade? Whatever possessed him to come tonight. Well I guess he doesn't know about Dick. Will you tell him? Of course not. You haven't said anything have you? Not a word. - Well, don't. It's pretty. - It has got a nice line. I carry it well don't you think? - Yes, indeedy. And Mumsy, look. Bought new shoes too. Of course I did. Had to have new shoes to go with the new dress. I charged them to father. - You shouldn't have done it. But they are pretty. Oh, and how are you? Gosh, you look pretty. That a new dress? - This? Well, as a matter of fact I think it is. Do you like it? It's swell. It ought to be. It cost fifty dollars. - Father. How about the movies, Marianne? They got a swell show on at the Palace. Oh, I don't think so. If you don't mind, I'd rather stay home with the family. I see so little of them. Well, what do you know about that? I know a lot about it. She's got another date. You have? Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Oh I don't, huh? I suppose if Dick Lindley was to walk in here now it would just be a coincidence? Father, will you make Hedrick mind his own business. Hedrick. - Yes, father? Come on, Wade. I'll teach you to play backgammon. Oh no. I'm no good at games. It's all the rage in the East. Everyone who is anyone is learning to play backgammon. [ Telephone ] Answer that, will you Hedrick? Answer it yourself. - Hedrick! Alright. I do all the dirty work for the whole family. She never does a darn thing for nobody. Hello, Doc. Hello, Hedrick. Well, how is the boy? - Fair to middling. Aha, so they finally caught those fellows in Cincinnati. Is that so? - Hello everybody. Hello, Dick. How is the doctor business, Richard? - Fine, Mr Madison. Hello Marianne. - Hello, Dick. Well, what's this? - Backgammon. You go and play. No. I'm no good at games. Say, there's a good picture at the Palace. Wouldn't you like to go? Why no thanks, Dick. I've got a bit of a headache. Oh, I'm sorry. But I tell you what I would like. A breath of fresh air. Let's take a little walk. Sure. You won't mind, will you Wade? No, not a bit. Anyway, Laura will be here any minute. Goodbye, Daddy. - Goodbye. Bye. - We'll be back soon. Bye, Dick. - Bye, Hedrick. Darling, I thought you might need these. - Thanks, mum. You're a dear. Hello Dick. - Hello, Mrs Madison. Have a good time. - We will that. Hello Laura. - Hello Dick. Haven't seen you for a long time. Oh well, I've been sort of busy. You know how it is. I guess doctors are kind of busy. Well they certainly are in this town. Well, I'm all ready. - Alright. Night, Laura. - Night. - Goodnight, Laura. Let's go to the moves after all. - Sure. Anything you say. Why, that's Wade's car isn't it? Yes. I think it is. Well, where is yours? Well I'm sorry, Marianne. I let my kid brother have it tonight. Oh, I hate to ride in a bus. Well, if I'd known .. - Oh alright. Come on. Sorry, Marianne. I didn't think you'd mind. You know Mrs Madison, you're looking younger every day. Now Wade .. - Yeah, you are. Father, couldn't you read in the dining room? The light is so much better there. What? Oh yes. Yes. The light is much better. Come on, Hedrick. Up you go. I don't want to go to bed yet. Oh yes you do and anyway you're going. You will excuse me. I have some sewing to do. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs Madison. They are certainly worried. Worried? About what? About marrying me off. Ha, that ought to be easy. You'd be surprised. Oh gosh, I think you'd make some fellow a swell wife. Would you now? - Yes. That's awfully sweet of you, Wade. The really swell one around here is Marianne. You're in love with her, aren't you. Oh gosh, I guess most of the gang is. I'm no different than any of the rest. I should think you would know enough by now when to leave the girls alone. It is going to be hard enough getting Laura married. I don't want to get Laura married. I don't want to get any of our children married. I kind of like having them right here. How would you like to play something for me? Why, I'll see if I can. I haven't played for a long time. Now what would you like? Oh, play anything. I don't care. I guess Dick is in love with Marianne too. He is one of the gang. Is Marianne in love with Dick? I guess so, Wade. What's the matter? Nothing. Only .. Oh, it's my head. I'm so tired. Do you mind awfully if I went to bed? No. Not a bit. I'm sorry you don't feel well. Thanks, Wade. I'll be alright. - Sure. You .. you just take some aspirin or something. The best thing in the world for you. Always fixed me up. Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. Why won't you let me see what's in that book? Curiosity killed the cat. Don't be so mean. Let me see. Go to bed. Just one little look? You go to bed. Alright. Goodnight. Goodnight. Say, Laura. Now what? There is something I don't understand. Yes? There is Wade in love with Marianne. And Dick in love with Marianne. And you in love with Dick and .. Goodnight, Hedrick. Alright. I'm going. You know, if we hurry we can catch the ten o'clock bus. That will be just swell. I'm sort of tired, you know. I had a busy day today. Alright. Come on. - Alright. Hey! Hey, wait a minute. Maybe the next time you take me out your brother will permit us to use your car. Sorry, Marianne. There will be another one along in half an hour. And in the meantime? - We can wait over there. Well, say .. - You're in a hurry, aren't you. No, I've got lots of time. For a moment I didn't recognise you. When did you get into town? Why, just yesterday. Haven't had a chance to look you up. You don't know Dr Lindley, do you. Dr Lindley, this is Mister .. I didn't get the name. - Corliss. How do you do. Glad to meet you. Hey, you! You can't park in the middle of the street. Move on. I'm practically moving. Since you nearly ran me down the least you can do is drive me home. Saves you the trouble, Dick. Coming all the way out to the house and then back into town again. I don't mind a bit. - But you said you were tired. Hey, you! Are you going to get going or do you want me to give you a ticket? Here we go. - Call me tomorrow, Dick. Goodnight, Lindley. See you again. That, if I may say so, was very neatly done. There was nothing exactly wrong with your cooperation. Do you belong here? - Where? In this town. Well, I live here but I don't belong. I get it. What's your ..? - What ..? Marianne Madison. What's yours? - Corliss. Val Corliss. Pleased to meet you. I assure you the pleasure is mine. Here is where we turn. On the right. Very good, madam. Last stop. All out. No. Not all. Just me. Oh, why? Well the family is probably still up. How could I explain you? We met. We met. - Where? I don't know. Where have you been? Very few places. You ever been to New York? - No. Chicago? - Cot even. Columbus? - Yes, I've been to Columbus. No. When? - Last week. Well fine. That's where we met then. You and I. The spring time in Columbus and .. - We met at Dansons. The Hudsons. Friends of the family. I stayed with them. Hurrah for the Hudsons. You know, the Hudsons are awfully nice people. They really are. They certainly were when they introduce me to you. Well. Goodnight. Goodnight. Would you call me tomorrow? Every hour. On the hour. Perhaps you'll come to dinner. Now don't tell me you cook too? If the family depended on me for that they would starve to death. Well. Goodnight. Say, wait a minute. You didn't give me your phone number. - You won't remember. It's in the book. Madison is the name. John Madison. Thanks. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh boy. Those are Marianne's. Right. Those are yours. Right again. You don't like lace, do you, Laura. Of course I do. Then why don't you wear lace pants? Oh for the love of .. Would you please go inside and get some more clothes. I will if you'll tell me why you don't wear lace pants. Just because I don't. I guess they might be kinda stretchy anyway. Hedrick. - What do you want? How long since you've been to aunt Sarah's? About a week. Don't you think it would be nice if you went there for supper tonight? How much? - A quarter. Cash? - Cash. When do I get it? - When you go aunt Sarah's. Okay. Ain't you through cleaning that yet? - No, not yet. We're having a Mr Corliss for dinner tonight. Will you stay and help? No, I got a date. - Please, Minnie. I hate waiting on table when there is company. Just this once. - Ha. I won't be through with the laundry in time. We won't have dinner until 7:30. 7:30? I never heard of such a crazy thing. But you will today, won't you Minnie? Please, Minnie. Alright. I'll stay. - And Minnie. You'll be careful won't you. - Of what? Well, of the way you serve. You won't drop things, will you. And you won't stand gaping and listening to the conversation. Say, listen. I told you that I got a date. And if you think you won't be satisfied .. No Minnie, I am sure you will do splendidly. But you will be careful, won't you? - Of what? Nothing, Minnie. Ha. Say, how many will I set the table for? Bless my soul. I forgot. - What? Sam and Amy is coming on the 5:30 this afternoon. Seven, Minnie. Sam and Amy? I sure will be glad to see them. Sam and Amy. Tonight? Can you imagine what they'll look like at that dinner table. Our Heavenly Father, we thank thee for every good and precious gift. And we ask Thee to bless this food which Thou has given us, thy servant. We beseech Thee to make us worthy of Thy bounty. And make us worthy, oh Lord, of Thy divine kindness. Amen. Why Hedrick darling, I thought you were dining at aunt Sarah's. Aunt Sarah dines at six. So I ate and came home. Alright Minnie. You can come in now. Please Hedrick, not so loud. Hello Minnie. How you been? Fine Sam. How is yourself? Been feeling pretty good considering we're expecting the baby any time now. Oh, I hope it's a boy. What's the matter? Listen Sam. Don't you know when you dine at 7:30 you ain't supposed to talk to the servants. Hedrick. It must be awfully nice having your whole family here at the same time. Yes. We're going to have some more in the family pretty soon, Mr Corliss. Oh, good for you. It's going to be a boy. Sam, how do you know? When I say I'm going to have a boy, I have a boy. How do you like what you've seen of Council City, Mr Corliss? Why, it's even more charming than I expected. What did you expect? Well, I don't know exactly. Just an ordinary small town. You're right. This isn't an ordinary small town. It's the fastest growing community in the country. What are you doing here anyway? - Shush. Hedrick! - Hedrick, please behave. That's quite alright. He's got a perfect right to know. You see, Hedrick. I'm Vice President of a new company named the Electro Household Corporation. The reason I'm here is with an idea to build a factory on the outskirts of town. You don't say so? Who's going to have the plumbing contract for your factory? I'm in the plumbing business. That is I was .. - Sam. You've interrupted Mr Corliss. - Not at all, Mrs Halcombe. I'd be very glad to talk that over with you when we decide to build. You see. I plan to take in a limited number of local people and make them partners. Oh, I think that sounds perfectly wonderful. Is that so? Who are you thinking of having? Well, your father for instance. His reputation for honesty and integrity is pretty well known to us. How would you like to be the secretary and treasurer of a big corporation? Me? Secretary and treasurer to a big corporation. Why yes, why not? Yes Daddy, why not? After all, I don't see why not. Of course Mr Corliss. You realize I haven't any money to invest right now. Times have been kinda hard. Now wait a minute. We don't want your money. All we want is your name and that sound business judgement of yours. Sounds good to me, Pa. Well, I tell you what I'll do. I'll look into it a little closer. Doggone, I'd like to be secretary and treasurer of a big corporation. Ah! Minnie. Minnie! Why, what's the matter? You little devil. Hedrick. Leave the room. Are you hurt? No, I ain't hurt. I think you are just wonderful. Hello? Mr Corliss? Just a second. Telephone call for you, Mr Corliss. Oh for me? Pardon me, will you. I was expecting a long-distance call. I took the liberty of telling the hotel where I'd be. Thank you. Hello? Yes. Yes. This is Corliss. Oh sure, yes. Fine. Oh, it's a great little town. Yes, seems like an ideal plot for the factory. What? Who wants more stock? Well, you tell them they can't have it. No, sir. No, we don't need any more money. Yes. That's right. Goodbye. [ Whistling ] I am too wonderfully excited for words. [ Whistling ] Hedrick. Hedrick, darling. Yes, dear? Isn't it your bed time? No, dear. Will you excuse me just a minute, Mr Corliss. Why, certainly. Goodnight .. Hedrick. What were we saying? Poor Hedrick, he does have such a hard time of it. Well I don't know. I guess kids are the same the world over. You've travelled a lot, haven't you. Yes, I guess I have. I wonder if I'll ever get away from here. Go places. See things. Dance in beautiful ballrooms. I guess the nearest I'll get to a New York cabaret .. Is the wrong end of a radio. I don't know. You can't tell. Stranger things have happened. Perhaps. Perhaps what? Hello Marianne. Oh! Hello Dick. You remember Mr Corliss don't you. Yes. - Hello, doctor. Well, how is the family? - Oh, fine. Dick, I wish you'd run in and get Laura out. The poor kid has been indoors all day. Do you mind? No. I'll bring her out. How would you like to take a little walk, Mr Corliss? There is nothing I would rather do than .. take a walk. Hello Marianne. What to do? - Oh, hello Wade. Mr Corliss - Mr Trumbull. How do you do. - Pleased to meet you. You're a stranger around here aren't you? Well I was, but .. The Madison family has been so kind to me, they make me feel very much at home. Oh, isn't that nice. Mr Corliss is going to build a factory in town, Wade. Oh, it is that so? Yes indeed. I hope it does great things for the town. Well I .. I hope it really gets built. What do you mean? Nothing, only .. There's been a lot of people going to build factories around here. Oh, I see. Well, I think you'll get one this time. That's good. We're going for a walk, Wade. Here is Laura now. - Hello, Wade. Hello. I'm going to show Mr Corliss your garden, angel. Really, Mr Corliss. Laura does the most marvellous things with flowers. They are just too beautiful. A beautiful night, isn't it, Dick. Yeah, it is. Please be careful. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go back .. and say goodnight. Then I'll get rid of them. And .. You come back in half an hour. I'll be back. And there is where Corliss intends to build. It looks good to me. It looks like a big thing. Here is a picture of the factory. Well. I'm going to leave it all up to you, John. When you say it's alright to go ahead. I'm ready to pay my share over to Corliss. And that goes for me too. And me. - Don't be too hasty. I'll write Ed Grieve in New York. To investigate the proposition and if he says it's .. it's alright and sends us a good report, why then I think we can all go in on it. Well, whatever you say, John. It's alright with us, eh boys? - Sure, sure. Excuse me. Hello? Yes? What? What? I've a boy! Amy's got a grandfather. Amy, she's got a boy. She's got a boy! It's a boy! - What? - Yeah. Here, keep the change. Pete .. I'm a grandfather. I'm a grandfather. Ha-ha. I'm a grandfather! Gosh. When I say I'm going to have a boy, I have a boy. Say, I didn't see no stork. - Shush. Hedrick. Say, you don't think they'll get my boy mixed up with the others, do you? They'll be able to tell him, alright. He'll wait with his knife. - Shush. I bet that's that Bloomberg baby over there. Looks just like his old man. Hey, Izzy. What's the price of overalls? Gee, that's a funny looking one there too. Where is my grandchild? Where is he? Amy? Everything is fine. You haven't a thing to worry about. Thanks very much, doctor. - Congratulations. Thank you, doctor. I hate to talk business, Marianne. I also hate to see your father .. Lose a chance to make a fortune. His friends are surely willing to put up their money .. As soon as he says the proposition is alright. What can I do to help you then? I'll do anything you say. It will mean a lot to you too. Oh, I know. Travel. See life. Columbus. No, but seriously. If you can get your father to sign this paper. You'll never have to worry about another thing as long as you live. I know how to handle father. You just leave it to me. I'd like to leave a lot of things to you. Come on, young man. There we are. Don't take him out too long, Sam. - Alright, Ma. Bye. - Bye. Well, how do you do Mrs Asterbilt. Once a plumber. Always a plumber. Where is father? In the dining room doing some bookkeeping. Hello Daddy. - Hello, Marianne. I just made out your check for your allowance. I'm sorry I'm a couple of days late. - That's alright, Daddy. I know you've been hard pressed. But you won't be anymore. That is. You won't be if you sign this. What is it? Just a letter setting down Corliss's proposition .. To be treasurer of this company. Hold on. It says more than that here. It says that I've thoroughly investigated Mr Corliss .. And the Electro Household Corporation and I've found them both to be .. But I haven't done anything of the sort. I haven't even heard from Ed Grieve yet. All I can say is, if you're going to wait forever it's going to be too late. You will never get in on it then. Well, it will just be too bad, Marianne. But I will not encourage my friends to go into something I'm not sure of. But you can be sure of this. Good heavens, you've only got to look at Mr Corliss to see the kind of man he is. This is just like you. Slow. Cautious. Always suspecting everybody. - I'm not suspecting anybody. It's just that .. - Don't lets go into all that again. I know what you're going to say. You've said it a thousand times before. All I ever hear is a lot of speeches about respectability and honor. And all the rest of that rot. - Marianne! Well, you can't eat respectability. And honor doesn't buy clothes and automobiles or all the other things .. Other girls have and I have to do without. Well, I'm trying to do my best. Your best? A lot of good your best has been. All our lives we'll probably go on being in the same rut. I'm tired of it, I tell you. And sick of being the daughter of a failure. Failure? - Yes. A failure, that's what you are. You never have amounted to anything and you never will. I hate you. I hate you all! How dare you. - How dare I? I'll show you how I dare. He's a failure, that's what he is. He's a failure! Get hold of the doctor. Quick. Quick. City 645 Hello? Hello? Is this Dick? This is Laura. Come over quickly please. Yes, Marianne. Yes, she's fainted. Oh, I don't know but hurry. Hurry. Nothing serious. Just nerves. Been under a strain lately? Oh .. so it's that. Ahem. I'll bet she's no more sick than I am. The lazy good-for-nothing thing. Why, Minnie. Bye. - Bye. Is it serious? Nothing, Mrs Madison. Just nerves. She'll be alright in the morning. I'm so relieved. Here, you're not so well yourself. Father! I'm alright, doctor. I guess I had too much dinner. Alright, nothing. You're going to bed now. Get my bag will you, Laura. Laura. Tell Marianne I didn't mean to upset her. And I'm sorry I couldn't do what she asked me to. Yes, of course. - Come on, Mr Madison. Oh, I'm alright, doctor. Better get him another blanket. I don't want to alarm you, Laura. It will take a good many days of peace and quiet to bring your father around. Don't talk of business. Just let him lie there and rest. I'll keep him quiet. Don't bother about coming down. - That's alright, Dick. If Marianne isn't asleep. You'd better tell her about her father. I think I will. Was she asleep. Yes. - Good. That's what she needs. A good night's sleep. I need a good night's sleep myself. I wonder if it's time for the baby's bottle. Not quite. You know Laura, you'd make some man a wonderful wife. I'll never marry. - Oh? Why not? Oh .. many reasons. In the first place .. oh, l don't know. I guess I've never found any man I could really fall in love with. Well, I'm not surprised. I don't know anybody that would be good enough for you. Now, Dick. - I mean that. Would you like a cup of coffee? Say, would I? Just wait. It will only take a minute. - Alright. Say listen, Dick. Don't tell anybody who gave this to you. Just say you found it. Well, here .. Where did you get that? Why, I found it. .. I .. I'm sorry, Laura. I never wanted you to know. I never dreamed you felt that way. You see I .. I know you didn't .. Let's forget it. Let's pretend it never happened. What do you say? Sure. That's the girl. You know, I don't think I'm going to be able to wait for that coffee. I have another call to make. You don't mind, do you? - That's alright. Some other time. - Sure. I'm sorry, Laura. Honest I am. I didn't mean any harm. That's alright, Hedrick. I know you didn't. Hello Dave. I've got Madison's letter right here in my hand. He says everything is a hundred per cent. We should go ahead and close the deal. Yeah. Just as soon as I looked at this fellow Corliss, I knew he was alright. Yes. Now, what's the next move? - Well. We'll call a meeting this afternoon and put up our money right away. Say, this is the greatest thing in the world that ever struck this town. As sure as sure alive, we're going to make a lot of money. You know that fellow Corliss is a live-wire? Well, I think so. You know Papa is inside. We brought him down this morning. Oh. Well, it's good to see you downstairs again. It's good to be here, Marianne. Gosh, I don't see why everybody is making such a fuss. I feel fine. - I'm so glad. Got to run. - Where you going? I'm taking some old clothes down to the Woman's Civic League, Dad. They are sending some stuff to the poor. Will you be back soon? - Yes. Hello Marianne. - Why, hello Dick. I'm just rushing off to the Woman's Civic League. I've got some old clothes for them. You will excuse me, won't you. If you wait until I see your dad, I'll be glad to drop you off. No thanks, Dick. I'm in quite a hurry. Scared? - Not a bit. Why should I be when I'm going to be your wife? Say, listen. I've got a great idea. Instead of getting married here, we .. - Oh, but .. Now you know perfectly well that .. Eloping couples never get married in their home town. I'm so happy I don't care where we get married. Are you happy too, Val? Am I? Do I look it? A few more weeks of rest .. And you'll be able to go back in that office and work harder than ever. I guess I'll have to. Well, how is the rest of the family? Just fine, thanks. And where is Laura? I guess she's upstairs feeding the baby. You know I haven't seen that baby for almost a week. I think I ought to go and take a look at it. Go right ahead. He loves visitors. Sure he loves visitors. He don't have to clean up after them. I've cooked more company dinners in the last four weeks in this house. Than most folks have in a year. [ Door knock ] Come in. Hello. Well. I thought I'd drop in and see how the young man was getting on. Oh, he's just as happy as he can be. - Good. And what an appetite. What does he weigh now? - Nine pounds two ounces. Well, I'm glad he's getting on alright. Clerk, please. Hello? Are you sure Mr Corliss hasn't come back yet? Did you get Mr Corliss? I phoned the hotel. He left town yesterday. Oh. It will be alright, mother. It's just like Marianne to want to elope. He'll probably come back today. You can come right in, Miss Madison. This is a pleasant surprise. - How are you, Dick? Fine. Let me get you a chair. - This will do nicely, thanks. Well, alright if it's a social call. - It is. It is. Very. I've got big news for you, Dick. I'm ready to marry you. Well, you asked me to, didn't you? Yes, of course. There is only one condition. We've got to be married immediately and leave town. I'm so fed up with it all. I want to get out of here right away. But I thought you were in love with Corliss, Marianne. I don't know what to say. You mean you don't care for me anymore? Well. Well no, not in the way I used to. You see, I thought you'd gotten over caring for me and .. Well I guess I just put you out of my mind. And then. And then? Then I fell in love with someone else. With Laura. With Laura? How wonderful. I just know you're going to be happy. Well. Thank you, Marianne. It ain't going to do any good worrying, mother. She must be with Corliss. [ Baby crying ] You go on up there while I get his bottle ready. You'd better wait out here, Tom. - Okay. Howdy, Mrs Madison. We want to see John. - Oh, he's .. He's right inside. You'll excuse me won't you. I am so busy with the baby. He's right in there. Hello. How are you, boys? Come to visit me or my grandson? Well, what's going on? What are you all so glum about? Corliss checked out of the hotel yesterday morning. Without leaving any forwarding address. - And he took all our money with him. Electro Household Corporation. Ha. There is no such firm. This looks very, very shady to me. Well then, why did you give Corliss your money? Why didn't you wait until I heard from New York? We waited alright. Until we got your letter. What letter? - You know mighty well what letter. John, I want my money or .. It's a master fraud, that's what it is. But what letter? Why .. Well, is that your signature? Corliss fooled me. And I thought he was alright. I'm sorry I got you into this, boys. You're sorry, that's fine. But what about our money? I tell you used the mail to defraud. It's a prison offence. Father never signed that letter. I forged his signature. What are you going to do about it? I can cash in my life insurance. That will pay some of it back. I can sell the house. I give you my word of honor I will pay back every cent that you've lost. Only promise me you'll keep Marianne out of it. Well, if John pays back the money, why .. I'm satisfied. Oh Daddy. Oh Daddy. Doggone, I'm just so happy, honey. I can't believe it's true. You've got it all coming to you, darling. You are the best-hearted thing in the world. Just look at all you've done for Papa. Oh, forget about it. There. Practically froze by now. You are a dear to come over and help. Always glad to do things for them that appreciates them. Thank you, Minnie. [ Buzzer ] Well, am I supposed to answer the door bell and do everything else around here? I'll answer it. Come on, Sweetheart. Somehow. It doesn't seem natural for her to be so nice. Oh dear. Surprise! Good to see you. Hello, Marianne. Come r?ght in, folks. Hello, Marianne. Oh, you little d?rling. * steve d *
