Hollywood man. They call me Hollywood man. Too proud to stand aside. One falling star that longs for one final chance. One chance to shoot for the sky. And if the world gets in my way, I'll still go on just the same. I'm asking for that one helping hand, that certain one who believes. Someone to share in a dream. Open your eyes, open your heart. Won't someone understand this Hollywood man? That's enough. Why did you waste your money showing me this crap? Bike movies are out. -Joe. I did three bike films for you for practically nothing. Hey, you know, you made a lot of money on me. -We're not going to start on that, are we, Rafe? -All right. I begged. And I borrowed. And I stole the $125,000 to make this movie. And a lot of people are dependent on me. And I'm not going to let them down. I need $375,000. If you don't give it to me, I'm screwed. -Sorry, Rafe. No. -Let's get out of here. -Yeah, let's-- yeah, let's get out of here. -Rafe. Wait a minute. Here's a number in southern Florida. The man's name is Angelo Russo. I'd advise you not to call him. -Thanks, Joe. -Rafe, when do we start? -A-- anything you want, Mr. Russo. You got it. -Angelo, Rafe. Call me Angelo. -Angelo. OK. Angelo, let me tell you. We're going to make ourselves a good film. -I know we will, Rafe. -Then everything is settled. Oh, Tony. Wasn't there one more thing you wanted to mention to Rafe? -Oh, yeah. Can I see you alone for a minute, Rafe? Uh, excuse us, Miss Martin, eh? Just a couple more things I want to nail down. -Oh, yeah. Sure. Can I freshen your drink, Miss Martin? -Now, we put up $375,000. You put up $125,000. We split the profits 50-50. -Yeah, that's what Mr. Russo outlined. -Yeah, provided that you produce a product in the specified time, with the specified money. -Right. Four weeks. We can do it. -Yeah, but if you can't do it, we're going to need some collateral, Rafe. It's just good business. -W--What do you mean, collateral? -Well, you owned your own last picture outright. You've got residual rights on two TV series. You got points in four other movies in. You've got a nice house in Beverly Hills. -That's a lot of collateral. -You said you'd produce in four weeks. -I can't-- I can-- look, I-- -Want to do this movie, Rafe? -Yes. Yes, I want to do this movie. -It's no problem. I'll draw up the contracts. -Draw up the papers. -Fine. -Well, is everything agreeable? Rafe, when do we start? -I can start in three weeks. -Make a good movie, Mr. Hollywood. Now, we all know what we're talking about, right? -Are you sure, Rafe? -I understand the terms, Mr. Russo. -I understand the terms, Mr. Russo. He understands the terms. We got enough insurance on our end. -Hey, there, Tony. You're late. -How you been, Harvey? -Good, good, good. How are you? -Good. Got a little job for you. Guy's name is Stoker. He's doing a movie down in Fort Lauderdale. Now, I want you to get on his ass, harass him, break his balls. Now, I want the movie finished-- but not on time. -Rafe Stoker, the actor? Yeah. -I'll handle it. I'm in. -Three, four weeks. Here. You get $5,000 more when the job is done. -OK, Tony. Tell you something, you picked the right guy for this. I've, uh, been in a few movies myself. -Just get the job done. Dominick. -Hey, Harvey. Who are them guys, anyway? -We're gonna make some bread, Mr. Rhodes. A lot more than he thinks. -You mean we got a job, Harvey? We got another job? -Yeah. In a while. Now, keep it a secret, all right? Don't tell the others. -I ain't gonna say nothing to nobody, Harvey. You know that. You know I ain't gonna say nothing to nobody. -My buddy, Mr. Rhodes. -Hey, Harvey. Can we go and have a beer with the rest of the gang? -Yeah. -All right! Cut it! That's beautiful! Pick up Barney. You all right, Barney? Get in there! What are you doing? Get him over here. How was it? -How the hell should I know? -Did you get it or didn't you get it? You got a problem. -Uh, no problem. Just, uh, working 26 hours a day. And I just shot a chase sequence that takes three cameras and, uh, I have one. I'm shooting this with short ends from "Gone With the Wind". -Dave. -And the crew's so tired, they can't hit their-- -Dave! Did you get the shot? -You bet your ass. -All right, print it! Print it! -I blew the shot. I lost the moustache. -You got the wig? -Sure, I got the wig. -Come on up. Get him up. Here's the wig. -I took off. I had the speed. I had the height. And right in the middle of the thing, I could feel it come off. The moustache came off. I must have blown the shot. -Barney. -What? -Barney. -Oh. -When you went off the end of the pier, is that what I was wearing? -Yeah. -Uh huh. -This is not good news. -Hey, Barney. I don't care if he's bare-ass naked. That's the greatest goddamn jump I've ever seen. -OK. Well, let's take it from the top. -Come on, Harry. I understand you're here in Southern Florida making an exploitation film on bike riders. Is that right, Mr. Stoker? Uh, y--y-- yes, sir. That's right. Well, how's your luck been so far? Well, it's rained every damn day that we've tried to shoot. You see, as a matter of fact, we were supposed to shoot the film in California. And, uh, well, we're doing the very best we can under the circumstances. Well, we sure hope the Florida sun will shine, so you can get yourself right back on schedule. That's what I'm trying to do, Mr. Simpson. -Hey, hey, hey. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Stoker. Mr. Rafe Stoker, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Wayne. And now back to music. -You want to be in the movies? -What? -You want to be in the movies? Hey, Tex? Jesus? Come here. -Our master's boss. J.J., you too. Get your ass over here. Come here. -Get your ass over here. Sure. -How'd you guys, uh-- how'd you like to be in a movie? -Outta sight! - stereophonic sound. -There's a movie shooting right now. Just wondering if you guys like to be in it. -Hey, Harvey. I'd like to be in the movies. -How you gonna get us in the movies? -How? If the star of the movie happens to be a personal friend of mine, dum dum. -Yeah, all right. All right. -Dynamite! -Come here. You stay here. -We're gonna be in a movie. -Why not? -J.J. -Hey, do I look good enough to be a movie star? -It'll be a giggle. -Do I feel like a movie star? -2,000,000 BC! Ha ha! -Um. Hey, Harvey. We really gonna be in the movies? -Certainly are, Mr. Rhodes. First I want to get some wheels. -But--but I-- -Just shut up and do what I tell you. We'll have a little fun, too. Wait behind the door over there until I call you. -God, you feel good. -I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry. Excuse me. -Yeah. Yeah? -Um, look, I didn't mean to bother you. Really. I was wondering if you had any, uh, gnat lotion. -Gnat lotion? Gnat lotion? -Gnat lotion. You know-- for gnats. -Uh, we don't have any gnat lotion. So, uh-- -Oh. OK, then. Heck. I'll just pop into town and, uh-- you know, I gotta say one thing, though, before I go. I really love what you've done with your van. -Look, I'm trying to tell you-- -Well, we tried to make it comfortable, you know? -Heck, I think it's terrific. What, are you kidding me? I got a friend of mine who's an absolute fanatic on the-- heck, he's right outside. Uh, Rhodes? Come around the side door, take a look at this place. I think you'll like it. -Hey, uh-- -J--j--just-- you don't mind, do you? Rhodes? What do you think of this? -Gee, this is nice, Harvey. -Is this what you had in mind, Rhodes? Isn't this nice? -I spent a lot of money on this thing. And I would like to spend some time with this chick. You know what I mean? -And they got the icebox, too, Harvey. -Rhodes, that's very good. I didn't even, uh, see the icebox. -I do-- I--I really like this. -Come here. Come here. Come here! Come here! -Harvey? Harvey? Harvey? Harvey? I think I killed him, Harvey. All right, cut it! Cut it. Dave, how was it for you? Right on. -Audrey, come here. Hurry up, Rafe. We're gonna get a light change here. -OK. Sit this turkey right over here. Because I want to go right over here. That camera there, I want to lay it right about here, OK? You give me 50 yards, and I'll cut. Dave, buddy, you're going to come right up over here, right up over the top of the hood. Lower that camera down so we miss the ramp. Bring it down. The ramp clear? Just about it. -All right. Now? OK. It's out of sight. -Get Barney warmed up. And we'll shoot this turkey. 33 marker. Bring him on. -Did you hear anybody say cut? God damn it, don't do that! -Did I say something? -You want to cut now? -Cut! Come on, man. Come on, man! Just give me that hand. I thought you were strong, man! Shut up. -Harvey? What's going to happen about those kids? -Shut up about those kids. Period. They're dead, and that's it. -Oh. A--Are you really going to get us in the movie? -I was in Spartacus with Kirk Douglas. -Uh, is that the one with the-- or the teeth? -Kirk-- Kirk Douglas. Yeah. -So? What happened? -I was too good. It wasn't Kirk. It wasn't Kirk at all. He's a nice man. It's those goddamn-- the money men, you know? Behind every day, you watch-- they call them rushes-- you watch the film you shot the day before. And I was too good. They were afraid I was making him look bad. Wound up with a part like that. Didn't know all that, did you? -Harvey? When you get to be a big star, then we can get married? I don't think that's very funny. What is so funny about that? -Shut up. -Ha! What have we got here? Mr. and Mrs. Clean? You two married? Yes we are. We just got married. We're newlyweds. -Oh. Tell me something. Do you-- -Jesus, Larry, get her out of here. -Look, lady, we're trying to eat in peace. -Oh, please. Don't mind me. Go right ahead. Eat. I like to watch. -Get out of here. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. Time out. Look here, brother. Ain't you got a sense of humor, man? We just trying to have a little fun. We ain't hurting nobody. I'll have you know that this lady right here is on the committee for Planned Parenthood. And her partner is a federal narcotics agent. -Do you know what this is, punk? -Uh oh. You two get out of here right now. -Right. -Sir. I apologize. Officer, I'm sorry. I consider this my fault. These people are with me. We had a party earlier. Get going. Way too much beer and wine.. Miss, I apologize. -You know, it's getting so that you can't have any fun anymore. Damn cops, they break up everything. -How was I supposed to know, huh? -Christ. -I got this punk hanging. I don't have to take that crap off nobody,. Newlyweds. I got them newlyweds hanging. Man, sure was. -Look at what we man. - Tuxedos. -Mr. Rhodes. This is excellent work. This is excellent work. -I thought you'd like that, Harvey. -Know what I'm gonna do? Just for this? I'm gonna see that you get a featured role in the movie. -Me? -Featured role. -Thank you, Harvey. -Let's get the hell out of here. -Hey, Rafe. I can't believe it. This is the first day we actually shot everything we scheduled. -Yeah. I just wonder if it was any good. -It was good. Hey, Rafe! -Yeah? -Hey. 5:30 production meeting. -OK. -Get some rest. -Night, Audrey. -Night, sweet. -Hey. Well, what I wanted to tell you was, uh-- I mean, that I noticed that you know that I screwed the shot. You noticed I-- I didn't have a leather jacket on. Well, I'll do it again for free. I know it's a low-budget film. You need the bread. I mean, that's all there is to it. -Hey. Let me tell you something, partner. You go off a 30 foot, 70 miles an hour on a motorcycle, and you jump 150 feet-- if somebody notices that you don't have a black leather jacket on, I'm going to kiss your Macy's window, and give you 30 seconds to draw a crowd. You know what I mean? -A tough guy, eh? for four or five years. OK. Later. -OK, Barney. -Joker. Hollywood man. They call me Hollywood man. Too proud to step aside. One falling star that longs for one, one final chance. One chance to shoot for the sky. And if the world gets in my way, I'll still go on just the same. I'm asking for that one helping hand. That certain one who believes. Hey, Rafe. Unless we get to this location today, we're going to have a. -OK, well what about the dailies? --dailies at lunch time. Barney? Have you got that fight scene blocked out? Because we have to have it today. -It's together. Give me about an hour. Talk to you about an hour about it, OK? -OK. And I promise you this time I'm not going to punch you out like the last time. -Can I say something? What? -What if it rains? -I'll get you an umbrella. -Dave, if it rains, then we move inside the store, and everything's fine. Right? -We don't have the store. -I'll get the store, Dennis. I'll take care of it. -What if you don't get the store? -Oh, you know what? I don't want to bring up bad news, or anything-- I have a little per diem for the fellas. No money since Tuesday. -Hey, Barney. Old buddy, didn't I ask you about 100 times not to talk to me about per diem or money? You talk to Dennis. -Talk to Dennis? Dennis told me to talk to you. -He did talk to me about it, Rafe. But I told him to talk to you, because until you talk to E. Brinkerman, we don't have any money. -I'll talk to Brinkerman! All right? -Calm down, pal. All right, everybody off the set, now! Keep it clear! Here we go! - All right! - turkey. pill wore off now. -Who's in charge of this outfit? -I guess I am, Officer. What, uh-- what can I do for you? -I'm going to tell you one time. And I want you to listen to me. I don't want to hear these loud son of a on my streets again. -We-- we had a permit. And I told you what we were gonna be filming. You said it was all right. -So you're not listening to me. If I hear these loud bastards on the streets again, you're not going to have any permit. -Yes, sir. -Nice jump, kid. Hey, you're charming. --that muffler for me, would you? -Covered. -Anybody working with me? -Everybody but God. We got a light problem because of cloud cover moving in. - We've got a light problem, then we use the. What's the matter with these-- -The generator ain't going to put out enough juice. And we got two-- -Bill. Bill. -Yeah? -Are you the gaffer? -Well, yeah. -Well, handle it for me, will you? -It's handled. -All right. Thanks. -Don't worry about it, Rafe. If we don't match the light, we can always donate the film to the Braille Institute. -You know that Evel Knievel. I mean, the guy's a great guy and all that. When I was at the Snake River, I was gonna jump the canyon. I just dropped me a little mescaline, had my 950. Built me a ramp. Took off from the ramp. I just came over the thing. And I missed it by 8 feet. You know what happened? -What happened? -I died. your joke. Let's go. go. -So you wanted to be in show business, huh, kid? -You just keep laughing, because your scene is coming up next. -Uh oh. -You see what you got there? You got. You call that a light. Excuse me, miss. Honey, I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for a personal acquaintance of mine, Mr. Rafe Stoker. Is he, uh-- he's a friend of mine. Is he here today? -Yeah. Yeah, he's in make up. -Make up. Where? -It's around the-- -Over here? -It's around the corner. -Thank you so much. How's it going? Good? -It's fine. -There he is! Eh? Like I told you. Eh? Rafe Stoker. Son of a bitch. For christ's sake, how the hell you been, man? -It's been a long time. How are you? -Jesus christ. Julie Martin. Julie. Julie, for christ's sakes. Julie Martin. -Excuse me. -For christ's sake. Julie, listen, I'm not just your average fan. I've done some acting myself. Rafe'll tell you. Listen, babe, I'd like you to know-- -Thank you. -You're something else. -Hey, partner. Hey. Hey. Hey. I don't want to be impolite, or anything like that. But we got to go back to work. And, uh, I'll tell you something else-- I don't remember you. -You don't remember me? No, I don't. -How soon they forget. Rafe, two and a half weeks, I worked with you on "Run, Angel, Run". For christ's sake. Give me a break. -Hey, Harvey here was in "Spartacus", man. "Spartacus"? Kirk Douglas? -Yeah, allow me to introduce my friend, Roach.

Let's go, brother. -Hey, hey settle down. Settle down. We got ourselves a movie to make. -OK. You're right. OK. -Good? Still gonna make a deal with him. For cash. Ain't nobody would mind some cash, is there? He ain't gonna go for it. You blew up his generator. -He'll go for it. -No way. -You get next to him, he's gonna knock you on your ass again. -Shut up. -I saw him a couple TV series. Looks about half tough to me. -Faggot. -And how would you know that? Huh? -He knows all about that stuff. Harvey's been to Hollywood. -I didn't know you were in movies, Harv. -Oh yeah, man. Harvey was in "Spartacus" with Kirk Douglas. Right, Harv? - The only pictures Harvey do, he play the coyote in. J.J. -Yeah? You know what a camera looks like? A movie camera? Real movie camera? -Yeah. -While I'm making my deal with Stoker, I want you to pick up the camera. -Got it. - Pick that up. Uh, honey? How's your bunny? Want to buy my associates here a round of drinks. They can get anything they want. And, uh, give the bill to this guy here, Jesus. OK? -Hey, wait a minute. I want to go with you. -Hey, Mr. Bartender. What's wrong with your pool table, here? -Why don't you try sticking a quarter in it? -You got a quarter, sweetie? -Sure do. -Evening, Robert. -Good evening, Mr. Russo. Nice to see you. -Thank you. -Your party's waiting for you right over here. Find them in the corner table. Nice to see you. -Angelo. How you doing? -Rafe, hi. Nice to see you. -Good to see you. -Always a pleasure, Julie. -What can I get for you? -Oh, nothing for me, thank you. Waiter? A bottle of your finest champagne, please, for my friends, to celebrate our new venture here. -Hey, thanks a lot, Angelo. And, uh, thank you for coming over. Because I know how busy you are. -Never too busy for you, Rafe. And my partners and I are very pleased to see the publicity that the new movie is bringing into the area. -That's great. -Then everything's fine. -Oh. Oh, yes. It's terrific. -Yeah, we got some stuff you can't believe. Julie is doing-- -I mean, Rafe is doing the directing. And-- I'm sorry. -Hey, Julie's fantastic, Angelo. -Then there are no problems. -Well, we got a couple a-- we got a couple of little problems. We ran into-- we ran into some rain. And, uh, we weren't expecting that. And then some bikers came through and shot a couple holes-- holes in the generator. -Don't worry about the punks. The generator's insured. -Yeah, I know the generator's insured. But some things came up that we-- Angelo. Angelo, we're behind schedule. -We're not really that far behind schedule. We think-- -Rafe. How far behind? -Five days. -I see. My partners and I give you $375,000. In return, you promised a good, commercial product. These are your figures. How much more? -Well, if we don't run into any more unforeseen circumstances, I need another $100,000. -$100,000? Absolutely out of the question. - last night. I met this chick at the bar. I took her home to the hotel. And I was-- you know, she said she wanted me to tie her up. -Yeah? Huh? All right. I'll be right there. I'll be back in a little while. Keep it warm for me. -Huh? -So I went down to the car to get some coke. And, uh, I came back. And this is what my attitude was when I came back. All the doors were all the same. What room is that? -Tex. I got it. -What the hell are you guys doing? The management called me. You're making so goddamn much noise. -You want the cops on our ass, fine! -Cops? -Yeah, they're going to call the cops. The hell with you guys. -This is good news! - This is. Hey. Look what I got here. -Pst! What about the camera? -Forget the camera. We'll get it later. -OK. Let's go. -I'm sorry, Rafe. Business is business. If you can't fulfill your commitment, we're prepared to write it off. But we won't be happy. -Look, Angelo. I'm trying to do something here. That budget I gave you was bottom line. I wasn't-- I-- I-- I-- I didn't-- -Rafe, I'll give you $50,000 more. -It's not enough. -My partners and I will commit ourselves to $50,000 more. Not $51,000. $50,000. If you'll guarantee me a good commercial product. If not-- -You got it. -Then that's settled. -Yes, sir. -Then we have no more problems. -No, sir. -Miss Harris. -Yes. -Always a pleasure. -Thanks, Angelo. -See you later. -I know that we've discussed this before. But why don't you let me use my money? It would be so much simpl-- -Julie, goddamn it. We've been through that. Just you being here with me on-- -Pardon me. I'm terribly sorry. Could I, uh-- could I, uh, trouble you for--for an autograph? I'd be very pleased. -Why don't you get out of here? -Just got here. -When you came on my set, you shot a couple of holes in the generator. And I punched you in the mouth. Let's call that even. But I want to tell you. If I see you again, or you get back on my set-- and I don't give a about that gorilla there-- I'm gonna hurt you. And I want it to be clear. Now, listen. Keep it quiet. Do you know what I mean? -Sure. Yeah, sure. You want to see a trick? See, that's the trick. I took one out. But you never quite know which one to take out. But this thing's got 5 more big ones in it. And it's got a hair trigger. So you better be. You understand? -Yeah. -Mr. Rhodes. Mr. Stoker here is not gonna let us be in this movie. -But you told me I was gonna be in the movies, Harvey. -What he's gonna do, though, is he's gonna give us some money to let him finish his movie. Mr. Rhodes, what do you think the budget would be on a stupid, little, turkey movie like Mr. Stoker here's making? What do you think? -I don't know, Harvey. I-- what do you think, Harvey? -Come on, Rhodes. Give me a-- take a guess. Give me a ballpark figure. Give me a guess. -I don't know, Harvey. -About $300,000? -Sure. About $300,000. -Yeah. -Very good, Rhodes. About $300,000? Well, Mr. Stoker here is going to give us 10% of his budget. How much would that be, Rhodes? -Uh, $3,000, Harvey. $30,000. -Yeah. $30,000. -$30,000. -I don't have $30,000. -I know you don't have it in your pocket, you stupid. But you can get it. I just saw Mr. Money Bags walking out of here. I know you can get it. And you're gonna get it. You know why? We're going to borrow Miss Julie for a while. -No. -Shut up. You shut up. We're going to borrow Miss Julie for a while. And then when you get it, we'll have a-- sort of a swap. You know. So what we'll do now, we'll just go for a nice little ride. We'll drop you off, Rafe, somewhere. I'll give you a buzz in the morning. OK? Yeah. Go ahead. Mr. Rhodes, why don't you walk out of here with Mr. Stoker. I'll follow behind with Miss Julie. -Is that OK with you, Mr. Movie Star? Let's go. -Well, good evening. Nice to see you. Do you have reservations? -Julie! Call the cops! -Son of a bitch! -Harvey! The cops! Come on, man. The cops! Let's get out of here, man. The cops! Get the hell out of here, man. -Billy Lee, check the back. Hey, boy. Come on down here. Come on. Now, I'm going to tell you your rights. You got the right to remain silent. I don't want to remain silent. I want to know what the hell I'm doing in the back of a police car with handcuffs on me. -You're going to jail. What do you think you're doing? -What for? -Who were those guys you were fighting with back there? -Look, I don't know who they were. I know they were out of their goddamn minds. -What do they want with you? -Hey, look. How am I going to report it to you? You wanted to chase me out of town already once today. -Now, when are you people going to get down to some reality. That's a real gun I saw out there. These people aren't playing around with you. What the hell you think you're doing? You want to make one of these cheap Hollywood movies? Now, we had this damn town cleaned up of that biker scum, until you and that damn movie crew came in here. Now they're back. -You know, this is really ridiculous. I don't believe it. Being here with you is like playing a bad scene in a B-movie with a dumb, honky Sheriff. -Well, you keep it up, Mouth. I'll show you a honky cop. -You got a cigarette? -I don't smoke. -I didn't figure you would. Look, I know this is hard for you to understand, but all I wanted to do was make a movie. I didn't want to cause you any problems. I didn't want to cause me any pain. But I've got to finish this movie. Will you let me? -You gotta finish your movie. -Yeah. -Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going to let you finish your movie. But I'm not doing you any favor. Because this dumb, honky cop wants a piece of their ass. -Thank you. Can I ask you something? -You haven't shut your mouth yet, have you? -What I'd like to know is, who do you hate most? Me, the bikers, or yourself? -You're just going to have to wait and find out, aren't you? Ow! Jesus christ. -What's he doing in there? What's he doing in there? -Please, sir. Just be patient. The doctor knows what he's doing. -How long is he gonna be in there? -I told you before, just take a seat! -Take a seat. Be patient. Psh. If he was your friend you were worried about how he was. Relax and sit down. You couldn't relax and sit down if your friend was in theres. Relax and sit. What's wrong with your little boy? -Oh, he's fine.
