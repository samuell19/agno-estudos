Some of you didn't know my daughter very well. She was quiet. Kind of a watcher. I... I remember when she was born. They wrapped her up and they gave her to me, and she looks up at me. Cathy will tell you, she looked up at me. We're kind of winding down, I'm afraid. Thank you so much for being here. - Yeah, alright. - Thanks for being here. Let's get together tomorrow. Yeah. Pony. Pony! Pony, come here. Hey. You alright? Hey. Are you okay? Aren't you freezing out here? Here. There you go. Is there, um... is there somebody I can call for you? Friends, family or something? You don't need to go to the hospital, do you? - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. Daddy's going to go hang out with his friends now, - and you're going to stay right here, right? - Mm-hmm. And you're not going to go downstairs? Not for anything? - Okay. - Where's mama? I'm going to get you some hot tea... yeah? Alright. Yeah, sorry about the mess. I... I just moved in. Ah, let's get you... warm. Yeah, that's better, right? Yeah. I'm going to get you some warmer clothes to change into. That was my grandma's. She, uh, she had that when she was a little girl. This is for you. I can help you. Look well, Ebenezer Scrooge, for only you can see me. What do you want with me? - Much. - Oh! I am... In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley. In life... Why do you trouble me? It is required of everyone, that the spirit within him should walk abroad, among his fellow men. And if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. Speak words of comfort to me, Jacob Marley. Speak words of comfort. Comfort? I have none to give. I am here to warn you. To save you, if that be possible. To warn. To save me... from what? We're going to put it in the truck when you're ready. I had this dream once. I was here... ...in this house. And then there was a knock at the door. And I opened it. There was a black car running in the driveway. And this faceless driver got out and opened the trunk. I got in. Look, I was supposed to have 200 signs by today. No, they're all blank. Yeah, thanks. Daddy's going to go hang out with his friends now, and you're going to stay right here, right? - Mm-hmm. - And you're not going to go downstairs? Not for anything? Okay. Hey. Are you okay? Aren't you freezing? Uh, listen, um... Why don't you come inside? I'll get you a jacket. That sound okay? Okay. Alright, uh, wait here, and I'll be right back. Here. It's been in the lost and found for a few weeks. You can take it. I would turn on the heat, but it does not work. Uh, so, uh... Do... do you need help? Some place to go? I've got these. Keep you... uh, should be comfortable. What we could do... ...is I could just take you back home... ...for a s... for a second, while we figure out what we're gonna do with you. Is that okay? Okay. Uh, come on in. Uh, take a seat. Get yourself warm, uh... Here you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. There you go. Uh, I'll get you some tea. Don't have tea. I'll get you some hot water. Alright, that's good. I'll get you a blanket. There you go. This should, uh, keep you warm. Better than nothing. There. Thank you. Yeah, no. Of course. Yeah, uh... I'll, uh, turn something on for you. Um, classic. Hopefully it's, uh... ...to your taste, um... I've got to take my brother to wrestling practice tomorrow. I'm going to go to bed, okay? Alright, good night. Ghost of the future, I fear you more than any specter I have seen. You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not been, but will be, in the time to come. And as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared... ...to bare your company. We drove for a long time. I wasn't afraid. Finally, the driver opened the trunk and we were in this desert. And there were two dark figures. One of them told me, if I went with them, I could live one last day. Make my amends, and... ...and then I'd be gone. The other told me, if I went with them... ...I could live forever. But I would never be seen. Not by anyone, except believers and... ...and sinners. I chose the latter. Suddenly, I was here again. And I was older. I don't know, 15, 20 years. And you were here and father was here, and everyone I'd ever known was here. Go that way, so what we need to do... - The beautiful lady. - It's good to see you. - How you doing, huh? - I'm good. - How was your day? - Oh, rough. - It's good to be home. I know. - Cold, my goodness! - Help me get this off. - Yeah, No problem. - It smells so good in here! - Of course it does. I'm doing my thing. You hungry? - Yeah. - Okay. I'm making it happen. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. - You doing okay? - Yes. Yeah? You ready for dinner? - Yes. - Yep. You want to play with me? Now, you go. It's flying. Hey, big guy. Time for dinner. Can I bring my friend, too? Yes, you can bring your imaginary friend, too. Come on. Okay, dinner time. The classic for my main man, here. - There we go. - Oh, thank you. Oh, definitely, definitely, definitely. Alright. - One for you, as well. - Thank you. Yes, dear. Yes, dear. - Okay. Yeah? - Oh, that's good. Thank you, baby. Right. I'll leave this here. Alright, we're looking good, huh? Yeah. Hey, hey. Baby, you okay? Sweetie, what's wrong? It's just... That guy... from the car wash. The DNA of that little dead girl... ...is on that man's body. How is that possible? My goodness. Hey, that's okay. I don't even know where to start. Hey! Sorry to leave you out in the cold there. Hi, Don? - Yeah? Hi. Yeah! - You're Frank, right? - This is Penelope. - Yeah, hi, uh... - Frank, buddy. How are you? - Hey, good to see you. Good to see you. You made it over alright? Penelope, tell them how old you are. - Um, 18. - That's right. They're all 18. Hey! - Oh! - Look at this! - Nice. - Whoa! Hey, uh... Where'd you go last night? Are you okay? Can I ask you a question? Yeah, yeah. If you had the choice between... ...living forever as a ghost or living one more day as a human, what would you choose? One more day as a human, definitely. Why? Well, if I wasn't human, I wouldn't get to manage my theater. Wouldn't get to see my dad. Wouldn't get to talk to you. There's lots of good little things about humanity. Uh, being a ghost, just being stripped of all that, it doesn't seem worth it. It's a lonely life, if you could call it that. But considering we're still both in the world of the living, uh, you doing anything tonight? No. Nothing? It's New Year's. Well, um... My friend is having a party thing, if you'd like to go? Come, now and see how others view Christmas. Where am I? Why am I not there? Before I... ...draw nearer to the stone at which you point. Tell me... Are these the shadows of the things that will be? Or are they the shadows of the things that may be, only? It's... it's my dad. His brother... Uh, I... I just found it, last week. My uncle just died of lung cancer a few months ago. So, we were going through his basement and, uh... ...going through his cabinets and, uh... There you go. But... No, I... I watch this... It's like I'm watching his ghost. It's like, uh, you know, like a haunting. A... a good haunting. You know? I mean, I guess I thought... ...he wasn't hurting you, and I could stand it. I could put up with it. I mean, what if he took you, you know? What if he took you from me? And where would we go? I don't have any money. How would I do it alone? And I just thought, you know, you might understand when you are older. If these shadows remain unaltered in the future, the child will die. Oh, tell me that he'll be spared. So... ...how much is it to ride the school bus tonight? Alright, here we go. I'll set the mood for us. Oh, right on. I love this one. Hey, you mind if I film this? Or is that, like, extra? Let's, uh, do something about this. Ooh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Give it to daddy. Oh, sorry. What did I do? What did I do? I don't... I don't want to die. Have a 10-55 on the north side of the park. Near the tracks. I need back-up. Copy that. You, uh, get any sleep last night? Good, good. I had a, uh... ...a dream last night. In this dream, I was feeling real hungry. I went to the kitchen and all we had left was a few pieces of bread. So, I get the bread, put it in the toaster. Turn it on. Wait... no toast. I said, "Okay, do it again." Turned it on. No toast again. So, I keep doing it over and over and over and over again. No fucking toast. Each time I just get a little more hungry. Yeah. Deja vu, or whatever. Ah, my brother's, uh, got something on, over at the high school, wrestling. My dad's gonna be there, so... Y... you want to come along? Yeah, sure. Sweet. - Hey. - Hey. You want any popcorn? - Sure. - Okay. Um, I have yet to see my dad anywhere, so if you can wave me down if you see this guy. - Right here. Thanks. - Okay. Hello. This is detective Sharron Crayborne. Is this Jack Wiley? Mr. Wiley? Hello? My little child... I had this dream once. I was here. In this house. - You were here. - Did you get the flowers? Father was here. Some of you didn't know my daughter very well. She was quiet. Kind of a watcher. I... I remember when she was born, they wrapped her up and they gave her to me. She had these old, old eyes. But she wasn't old. And she never will be. Anybody who's a parent will tell you that you would die for your children, but I did not expect... ...that I would stand up here and tell you that I would die, and I would let every single person in this room die, for five minutes... ...with the woman that you'd become. I wonder what she's like. I can tell you that she'd be kind, like her mom. I'd like to think that she'd be tough, like her dad. I can tell you that she would never stop fighting for justice, or helping those less fortunate than herself. I can tell you, she'd be smart. But I can't tell you what she'd look like. Can't tell you the stupid stuff we would probably fight about. All the stupid, useless mistakes we would make, and the ways we would hurt each other and the ways we... ...would forgive each other. Yes? No? - Yeah, yeah, I got them. - Okay, great. See, that wasn't so hard. And there were two dark figures. One of them told me, if I went with them, I could live one last day. Make my amends, and... ...and then I'd be gone. The other told me, if I went with them... ...I could live forever. But I would never be seen. Not by anyone, except believers and... ...and sinners. Where's Mama? Mom is out right now. We don't want to tell her anything about this little party, okay? - Um, 18. - That's right! Because it's just a secret between you and me, alright? Three heads, that's 1,500. Okay, no, I... I got you, but, just sort of, like... How many fucking ones do you have to put in here? Jesus Christ! - Okay, I love you. - Love you. Mom! Mom? Mom? I chose the latter. And all I can do is watch, as all the people I'd ever known and loved... ...live their lives. Grow old. Forgot about me... ...and died. And then I was alone. I was just alone. Uh, ho, ho, ho, ho! Uh, merry Christmas! Are there any little girls in this house? Huh? Anybody? It takes her two seconds to get down here when her friends come, but on Christmas morning... Hey, merry Christmas! - Oh! - Santa! Now, what present do you want? - Um, that one. - You want this one? - Yeah. - You sure you don't want this one? - No. - What about this? - Please, please, fix my beard. - Here. - Thank... thank you. - You look the part. Alright, tear off the bow! Open up the present! Mm, and while you're doing that, Mrs. Claus is going to get Santa a little drink, so we can have some more Christmas fun! - That wasn't so hard. - Take it easy, okay? What do you mean, "Take it easy"? Am I not taking it easy? I'm fine. God, what are you... what are you doing? Please don't be like this. Really? Come... do you... By the way, do you think she can't hear you? She's right there. Do you think she can't hear you just because you whisper? Hi, by the way. It's me, I'm your dad. - There is no Santa. - Sweetie, go and pick another one. - I think they all have your name on it. - So, this is Christmas? This is how we want to spend the holidays, is it? I paid for these presents. I paid for this house. I paid for this tree. I pay for your clothes. - I pay for literally everything. - Alright. Alright. You don't have any idea of the situation you would be in, - if it weren't for me. No, no, no! - That's enough, Frank. Stop. Fuck! Come on. Fucking dramatic. Sweetie! Come on. Honey. Sweetie. You can't go locking yourself in... ...every time something upsets you. Okay, if you're not coming out... ...I'm coming in. Three... ...two... ...one... Glorious! Glorious! Oh, and merry Christmas! Oh, Spirits, you've done it all in one night!
