Kiss me, little husband of mine. But... Your mother will give her consent, right? Of course, you big silly! Come on, then! - Goodbye, Romilda. - Goodbye. Listen, eh... I almost forgot. Mummy has always told me... ...that a young couple needs at least 50,000 lire, ...to settle down. Since I don't have a dowry, I think she will insist on that. - Could you discuss it with your mum? - Of course. - Really? - Yes! Greetings, aunt. Life is wonderful! Life is wonderful? Idiot! Hello, Mum! What's wrong? - You look worried. - I just had a thought, darling. Good! Because I am so happy today! Give me a hug. I'm marrying Romilda. Just like that? Right away? Right away. You seem to be in a hurry, darling. Such things shouldn't be taken lightly. I haven't been taking them lightly, I'm fully committed. - When will you get married? - As soon as the invitations go out. You know that Romilda, that is to say her mother, is hard-up. - Very much so. - I'll marry Romilda without a dowry! Oh? I'll be supplying everything, which is much simpler. - I promised... - How much? Fifty thousand lire. That's not too much, is it? You won't be in need? Not at all, darling. Not so long as you're happy! You are happy? Romilda? Of course I am, Mum. You know I am. You don't look like it. Yes I do. You specifically told him 50,000 lire? - Eh? - Yes. Isn't it enough? It's very good. Give me a kiss, my child. In my capacity as editor of the Miragno Echo, ... I wish you all the happiness that... I mean, all the happiness... all the happiness in the world! For you are united like a vine with an elm tree. Mathias, you are the young elm. The climbing vine, that's you, Romilda! Ah, the alluring vine... that's the source of this wine I'm drinking in your honour... because... because... I'm dying of thirst! Very good, my dear editor... your metaphor of the young elm and the climbing vine! Thanks. The young elm will soon be suffocated by the climbing vine! A vine which in fact is not a virgin vine! Well put, my good man! You've got a real journalist's touch! You're having a good time here. At weddings, people dance. Meanwhile, here's a little bill for the newlyweds. - The invoice for the champagne. - They'll pay at the end of the month. At the end of the month, you won't be here any more. - What are you saying? - That's what my boss is saying. What did he say? That Mr Malagna will move in here at the end of the month. - May I? - Yes. Mrs Mathias Pascal, will you grant me this mazurka? I'm tired. - No... - Let's go! - You know you want to. - Shut up. Since we've danced a jig together out in the country... - ... you can't refuse me a mazurka. - Shut up. - Mr Mathias? - What is it? Pardon. A bill, already? You're not wasting time! Come with me. Romilda? Listen, please be good and pay for the sparkling wine, will you. - Pay with what? - Pay with what? You haven't spent 50,000 lire on hats already? - Mummy has the money, silly. - Your mother? Yes, she's keeping it for us. Come with me, then. Since you've taken on the role of banker for your children... here's a creditor already. - What's this? - The wedding champagne, madam. What am I supposed to pay this with? Romilda told me... I'm not going to touch a single cent of the 50,000 lire! That money is sacred. But we're giving our permission. - Your permission? - Yes. Ha! He's a scream. That's well and good, but... the champagne? Who's paying for it? I'm begging you, Malagna, please pay. - This is getting embarrassing. - I can't do anything. - If you'd only listened to me... - What do you mean? You know we had to mortgage your last properties for this wedding. - Even the Spruce Estate? - Everything, madam. So, we're ruined? What? Ruined? You're... We're ruined? That really takes the cake! You must have known! You've strung us along! I didn't know that we owed that much money. - Who's profiting from the mortgage? - I thought I was doing the right thing. He's to blame! He's a scoundrel and a jackal! You've screwed us over! You vulture! He came back while I was away, and you signed, you idiot! I've had it! I don't even know you! Oh! You jack... jack... ... jackal! You... ... rascal! Since you're the one with the dough... Very well, I'll pay for the champagne, just so there's no unpleasantness. It's obvious that this place isn't the Spruce Estate. You allowed it to be sold... I didn't want to owe money to anybody. Not to anybody, madam? You shouldn't have borrowed money in the first place! Of course I'm touched. I thank you for... - ... your hospitality... - Hospitality! We couldn't leave you out in the street! Romilda! Let Mathias serve himself. You're his wife, not his maid. You raised your son in a strange way. A lazybones! You turned him into a lazybones! - Mathias is very young... - Is he going to keep four mouths fed... ... by chasing butterflies? You're not answering? Are you going to feed your family with grasshoppers? Oh, Madam! I'll get a job. Ha! Doing what? Excuse me. He'll get a job... He must think he'll find someone stupid enough to hire him! You look sad, Mathias. Don't worry, everything will work out. Mrs Pescatore is a bit fierce. But just maybe, deep down, she has a big heart. Mum... In any case, you didn't marry the mother! Eh? And since Romilda loves you... Go and find her, darling. Go on. Good evening, Romilda. Good evening. Don't you want to give me a kiss? Yes, I do. Here you are. Now leave me alone, I'm all worn out. - Listen, Romilda... - You're annoying me! I have no advice for you, Mathias, ... except that newlyweds can't survive on insects. Take heed! She's right! Hello, Mayor. My dear Mathias, this is your lucky day. You really have something for me? Yes, I do. Have a seat. - Do you like books? - Books? Yes, big ones, thick ones, books of every kind! We have more than 60,000 in our town library. You follow? Sixty thousand, which have to be classified, arranged, and catalogued. - Would you like to be in charge? - But... The librarian's too old, I'm making him retire. If you want it, the job's yours! The old geezer will teach you. Soon you'll be... ... the kingpin of the artistic, cultural, and scientific life of Miragno! Very well, I accept. But could you let me know, right now, about... - The salary? - Yes. - Very well. Are you wanting a lot? - Oh, no... - But... - Listen, I'll let you have... Sixty lire! - Uh... - You're fine with that? - I don't know how to thank you. - Don't! See you soon. I'm glad to have been able to help you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! - And thanks again, Mayor. - Don't mention it, Mathias. And I, meaning the town council... - ... am ahead by 40 lire just like that! - How so? You see, I was paying 100 to the silly old duffer. - One hundred minus 60 equals 40! - You know your maths, Dad! I want you to leave this house, immediately! - Come and live with me! - What about Mathias? He'll come for visits! You've been coughing for weeks! Look at you! You're crying, you're getting thinner... That's the work of the old Pescatore widow! - Be quiet... - She's an old hag! Old hag? I won't be insulted in my own home. - Your own home? Did you hear that? - Leave or else...! - You're not scaring me! - Oh, I'm not scaring you? - Well, take this! - Oh! This is getting personal! What should we do, Scholastica? We'll pack our things! And after that, we'll be on our way! Go on! You old hag... ... you vulture! Quick, where are the bags? There. What about Mathias? Oh! He'll come and see you. Hurry up! Where's your bed linen? There... Mum! Mathias has got a job! - You got a job? - Yes. Starting tomorrow, I'm to be the librarian of Miragno. - Are you getting paid? - I certainly am. - Sixty lire a month. - How much? - Sixty lire! - Sixty lire? Yes. Imbecile! Gardano, Natural Magic! What? Gardano, Natural Magic! Gardano, Natural Magic! Adrien Meis, Treatise on Astrology! Adrien what? Adrien Meis! M, as in mug! E, as in etc! I, as in illusion! - And S, as in stupid! - And S, as in stupid. I hear you. Why are you still working when you've retired? Yes, I have retired. I don't earn any money any more. So why have you stayed on? - Eh? - Why have you stayed? Where else can I go? For 40 years I've been here every day. I'd get bored doing anything else. Mr Pascal! Your aunt Scholastica sent me. Has my mother got better? I don't know. You have to come with me. Go to Mrs Pescatore's... ... and tell my wife to meet me at my aunt's place. This is for you. Now hurry. You're not going! That old viper insulted me and almost killed me. Mathias' mother could have lived with us and died here. Scholastica... The envelope... Oh, it's not much. A few hundred lire. All that I could save. It's for you Only for you. Do you understand? You can make use of it... One day. Mother... Mother... Mathias? The poor woman is fortunate. Her suffering has ended. While I... It's true that those who are left behind... ...are the ones to pity. What about the funeral? What are you planning? I don't know yet. You'll need money. Exactly, I... So ask the mayor to help you. He'll sort it out for you. He has funds allocated to help people in need. Leave him alone, Romilda. He needs to be alone, as you should understand. Come on. And when you die... ... you come back to earth! Truly... Pay attention. We're... Oh, are you drunk, or what? Get up. There. Truly, I don't see... ... why people get buried... Oh, Mr Pascal! - Where are you off to? - Me? I don't know. Nowhere special. - I'm taking a walk. - When you're in mourning... walking helps. Goodbye, my friends. Goodbye, Mr Pascal! Because when you die... you come back to earth! If you'll allow me to express an opinion... Please do, Pomino. We think of you as part of the family. - He's thrown himself into the water. - I wouldn't be surprised. - He's foolish enough to have done it. - We have to do something! A search ought to be mounted. We should go to an agency. An agency? Can you afford that? No. The police will find the fool. Yes, that's what they're there for. - Will you take care of it? - I'd be glad to. Since someone has to, I mean. I'll ask my father... - ... to contact them. - Thank you. Goodbye, Romilda. Do you like travelling, sir? No. I don't either. So you're not going far, then? Oh, but I am. I'm going far away. Aha! To America. It's a beautiful country. It's a wealthy country. It seems people can get rich there. Are you going to try your luck? Maybe. I can tell whether you're a lucky person or not. Answer me. What's the time? Answer quickly. - Uh... - Quick. 10:27 am. Tremendous! You won. - You're not going to America any more! - Oh? Have you played roulette before? - Never. - Never? Fantastic! You're the person I need. I'm not letting go of you. If you've never played before, place some bets and you'll be rich in two days. - When's your boat leaving? - In two days, from Marseilles. You'll be a winner for sure! - Get ready. We've arrived. - Where? In Monte Carlo. Let me introduce myself. I'm Sir Titus Lantz. No more bets! They won't be accepted! Eight, black, even and low! There's a free seat, take it! Gentlemen! - Put your money down. - But where? - Place your bets! - Anywhere. Have all bets been placed? No more accepted! Twenty-two, black, even, high! - I won! - Just play and shut up. Gentlemen! Place your bets. No more accepted! Well, what did I tell you? I've earned a slice of cake for teaching you, wouldn't you say? - What do you mean? - I normally take a 10% commission. But we're friends, so you can give me whatever you like. Go on, help yourself. - Thank you. - Where are you going? Off to lose it all. Have all bets been placed? No more accepted! Five, black, even, low! You have the luck of the devil. Yes, and I have no idea why. Well... So? Did you win? No, it's like I said. I told you "I will lose", ... I lost it all. That's what the game is like. - But... Don't you want to keep going? - No. I'm heading straight back to Miragno. What are you going to do with all the money? Me? I'm going to buy back the Spruce Estate. Excuse me? I'm going to take my wife away and get Mrs Pescatore to show me some respect. - Mrs Pescatore? - My mother-in-law! Goodbye, Sir Titus. Hey! Who's died? Her son. Her son? Yeah, Mathias. Mathias Pascal. What are you saying? - Mathias Pascal? - Yes. - But that's me! - What? It's me. Mathias Pascal, that's me. It's not right to joke about death, sir. It brings bad luck. Yes, it was wrong of me to be joking around. Hang on. Here, this is for you. Thank you, sir. But, could you tell me, ... how did he die, this...? What was his name, again? - Did you know him? - Mathias Pascal? No. I can't possibly know everyone I dig a grave for! He killed himself. He drowned, a few days ago. He's gone. Disappeared. It was grief. These things happen... It was because of his mother, who's lying over there. Poor fellow. Here he comes! - Who? - Mathias Pascal. Grant eternal rest, O Lord. - Rest in peace. - Amen. Mr Mathias... Mr Mathias Pascal... Shut up! Stay there, don't move. What a time this has been! What terrible days of dismay and... and unspeakable anguish for the bereaved family. We loved you, Mathias, for the beauty of your soul, ...your jovial character, your natural modesty, ...that allowed you to endure with equanimity... ... your challenging lot in life. O you, friend of books and of insects... distinguished librarian, skilled entomologist... the butterflies you loved so much will land on this tomb... ... to close their wings. Rest in peace, Mathias. It is with a broken heart, dear friend ... that we say goodbye, ... for the last time. Are you really crying, Romilda? I always cry at funerals. Mr Mathias? Swear you won't ever say you saw me or that... - ... I'm alive. - You can count on me. I wouldn't have, even if you hadn't asked. Yes, because... Mr Pascal, ... that fellow there, in the ground... well, I was the one who... What? You killed him? But who is it? He was a railway worker. Nobody knew him around here. We were drunk... You remember, you met us on the path. You remember, don't you...? We had a fight. He hit me. I pushed him a bit, and he fell in the river. It was you they were looking for, but it was him that they found ... eight days later. Your women identified you. It's true that you look a lot like him. Oh yes, you can be sure I won't be saying anything else. They can work it out for themselves! Mr Pascal... you're not going to turn me in, are you? Of course not, you idiot. I also want them to think that I'm dead. You won't turn me in, because I'll be keeping the truth under wraps. Now, go away. Farewell, Mr Pascal. And good luck. Maimaine! Watch out, sir. Her shoes will soil your clothes. Oh, she's a sweet girl. You must like children. Do have any yourself? No, I don't. Really? Married... and without children? Mr Pascal? Mr Pascal... - You know my name? - Your papers. You nearly lost them. I'm very grateful to you. Sir? I'd like a room. - Are you on your own? - Yes. Well then, room 25 will be perfect for you. - Would you like to see it first? - That's not necessary. - No luggage? - No. So, the name is... Sir...? Um... So what is it? My name is, um... It's Meis. M-E-I-S. I'm not following. If you could it write down... It's just a formality. A regulation, you know... Arriving from... Lucien? Maurice? Arthur? Come closer. So, Mathias? You're the last one, as usual? Pardon? Excuse me, I'm calling my pigeons. Not the people walking in the park. I've given them names. Misunderstandings happen. Is your name Mathias? Mine? No. No, but the idea strikes me as... ... really surprising, in fact, original... - ... to call pigeons like that. - It's so convenient! Please have a seat... May I? Yes, it's very convenient. I've been noticing you in the park for a while. Always alone, always sad. What's wrong? A broken heart? - Have you lost someone? - Yes. A friend. A nice boy. A bit slow. He was always chasing butterflies. You're a dreamer, sir. Yes, maybe I'm a dreamer. And I'm sure that you like calm and tranquillity. - Yes. - Just like me. I live in a charming and quiet boarding-house. A paradise of silence and comfort. Doesn't that tempt you? - Oh... - Go on, make up your mind. I'm sure you'll decide to do it. I'm always here at 11 o'clock. - Miss... - I'll see you again some time. Daniel? André? Come closer! Thanks. Mr Meis! I have a nice surprise for you. You're about to see someone you like. - Who? - Someone in your family. Your cousin Adrien! Greetings, cousin! Don't you recognise your cousin from Syracuse? This is Octave Meis, your cousin. Cousin Adrien from Milan. - I'm not from Milan. - In the register... - ... you wrote you came from there? - Yes, but... So, you're from Livorno. He's from Livorno! No, I'm not. Milan, Livorno, all Meis's are family! Give your cousin a hug, children. Give him a hug. Listen cousin, if you're neither from Milan nor from Livorno, ... I'll work out where you're from. The tree is always with me. The tree? What tree? The family tree of the great Meis family! We'll meet again, cousin! We'll meet again. Excuse me, miss. I'm waiting for someone. Yes, someone like you. I mean, someone feeding pigeons like that. Miss Caporale, no doubt? You know her? I'm standing in for her. She's a bit unwell. But she never forgets about her pigeons. So, to help her out... That's kind of you. Kind? I suppose. But first and foremost it amuses me! Would you like to try? I don't think I have it in me to be a bird charmer. Did you have a message for Miss Caporale? Well, in a nutshell, I need a place to stay. - Oh... - No, I'm giving you the wrong idea. I've left my hotel and am looking for another place to stay. Miss Caporale spoke highly of the place where she was staying... - So it's you? - What do you mean? Since yesterday, Miss Caporale hasn't stopped talking about... ... the young man she met in the park. You'd like to stay at the Paleari boarding-house? Why not? - Do you live there too? - Yes I do. I'm the daughter of the house. The landlord is my guardian. Come on. I'll take you there. Would you like to wait a moment? I'll let my guardian know. - You're most kind. - Who's this? This is Count Papiano, my guardian's business partner. This is the gentleman that Miss Caporale has been talking about. - Ah! - He would like a room. - A room? - Yes, a room... - ... and I'll be having my meals here. - Certainly. Well, you can leave us, Louise. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, you're out of luck! Even though I would love to be able to put you up here, ... unfortunately the boarding-house is full up at the moment. What? But... Full up? Are you joking, my dear count? Sir, I have a small room, in fact it's not that small at all. It's on the second floor. You'll do very well there. It's nice and light, and as clean as a whistle. - But it's reserved for... - For my customers. This gentleman has been recommended by Miss Caporale. If the gentleman likes the room, he can have it. Follow me, or rather... do me the honour of leading the way. Marie, you can add a place setting starting from today. My dear Louise, I'm a bit surprised and worried about you ... bringing around people like this. Where did you find him? In the park. He was waiting for Miss Caporale. It was by chance... I don't much care for that sort of chance. Especially when it comes in the form of a man. Understood? Do you like the room? Very much. Very much. Well, then, welcome to your new home. Oh, perfect! Will you be staying long, sir? Quite some time. Several months? - Maybe more. - In that case, we ask... ... for three months in advance from our guests. - Will that be a problem? - Not at all. I'm very glad that you'll be putting me up for... ... at least three months! - So, how much is it? - Oh well, 120 times three, 360. Three hundred and sixty. Three hundred... ... and 60. Thank you. You're asking for too much, my dear count! Three months in advance! That's not the way we do it. It's remarkable that the young man had the money on him. Have you gone crazy? You say there's no room available... ... then you ask him for a guarantee! - It's madness! - Keep on complaining. - You've got the money. - You're the one with it now. I'm looking after it for Louise, for you, and for the family. Dear future stepfather, I'm in charge of the finances now! You spend money with such consummate skill! Here's 50 lire. Go and spend it as if you were a young man! Come in! Please excuse me, my dear sir. I have a small service to ask of you. Would it be possible for you to wear this flower in your buttonhole? Excuse me? It's in honour of Louise Paleari. Miss Louise Paleari, the young lady who brought you here. - Indeed. - She's getting married soon. - Oh! - Yes, we're getting married. - I'm going to be her husband. - And? Tonight, we're having our engagement party. Well, my compliments to you, Count Papiano. Thank you. Adèle! Oh! Adèle? Where's our cousin? Adrien? I haven't seen him all day. Ah! Here's the manager. Sir? - Sir? - Yes, Mr Meis? - Where's my cousin, Adrien Meis? - Don't mention his name. He left this morning, without saying where he was going. - Can it be true? - I want to show him his place in the tree. He left without leaving a forwarding address! - Eh? - He's gone! Just a minute. Come and have a look. The family tree of the great Meis family! Adrien Meis is the tree trunk. The famous astrologer of the Middle Ages. Yes, he was called Adrien. Just like my cousin! My grandfather... Um... Frederick. And my grandmother... Um, Charlotte. There! Well, I too have a family tree. Just like my cousin. And... I've come back from America, ... where I spent... five years. Yes! Anyone can go there to check if they want to. I'm telling you that exactly... ... 2705 lire have disappeared since you've taken charge of the finances! I'll have an accountant come over tomorrow... ... to examine the bookkeeping, and, if it turns out that I owe you an apology - ... I'll give it. - There's no need for that between us! You want to call in an accountant? I was thinking of doing that too. - So much the better! - This accountant can look into ... the financial position of my wife-to-be. - The girl I've been raising? - Yes, dear father-in-law to be. - I beg you... - How much will the dowry come to? - Oh my goodness, stop it! - I'm asking for... Calm down. You know that money means nothing to me. I'll marry her even without a dowry. That's what we've agreed. But get these silly notions out of your head. The books are in good shape. Good books make good friends! Let's shake hands. Dad? Everybody's waiting for the party to begin. How wonderful! Are you happy, Louise? Yes, Dad. Very happy? - Of course I am, Dad. - Of course! How wonderful she is. Oh, Mr Meis is the only person who's not here today! He's not polite enough to arrive at our party on time! Just give him time to get ready. I'm not waiting to have a toast... ... to the happiness of my fiancée. Louise, let's drink to our engagement! Oh! That brings bad luck! That's a silly thing to say! A broken glass brings good luck. Mr Meis, please join us... so that I can introduce you. Mr Meis, Dr Baldus. - Do you come from Rome? - No, I don't. I bet you're from Naples! No, not from Naples either. He has that Florentine look! Mr Béraldez, a great artist! - Am I right? - No, I'm an American. - Oh! - Or rather, an Italian from America. Miss Pepita. Mr and Mrs Cantinelli. Please take your seat. Ah, ah! Did you know that the Great Max predicted you would be coming? - The Great Max? - You'll get to know him. It's Madame's ghost. We have a bit of an interest in spiritualism in this house! - Some lobster, Mr Meis? - I'd love some, Miss Pepita. Have a taste of my salad. Do you have a cook in the house? That's very funny! Isn't it? I'll explain. Here in the Paleari boarding-house, we take turns with the cooking. - That's an original set-up, isn't it? - Yes, very. After all, the best way to have food dished up is to do it yourself. Do you like the idea? You'll have your turn soon! What's wrong, darling? I'm feeling depressed. Oh! I don't want you to be sad. My marriage won't stop us from seeing each other. You want to keep going despite...? You're disgusting. I'm disgusting? Come on, sweetie... - ... if I'm marrying Louise... - It ought to be because you love her. Silly girl, you know that I love only you. Hmm? But I want you to keep an eye on Louise. - What? - It would be best if Meis... ... kept away from her. Have you ever handed over any mail to Mr Meis? - What mail? - Have you delivered any letters... - ... to him since his arrival? - Letters? There's been no mail for Mr Meis! It's strange... No letters, no visitors, no friends... - It's odd, isn't it? - Eh? Hmm... Go on, off with you. Yes? Mail delivery, Mr Meis. Is there mail for me? No. Still nothing. - Well, what's that supposed to mean? - Nothing much. I'm just... ... saying there still hasn't been any mail for you, ... in the month you've been here. Caporale? I think you're right. Mr Meis is hiding something. We had an accident on the way back from the market. - Nothing serious? - Our carriage hit a passer-by. When a constable asked Mr Meis to make a statement, he took off. - It's strange, don't you think? - No. Do you want my opinion? Mr Meis is an aristocrat. He's in hiding because of a quarrel with his family. They wanted to make him marry a young girl. - He didn't love her, so he left! - The police wouldn't care about that. No, that's true. So, there can hardly be any doubt. He must be some kind of conspirator. You think so? - He's no thief or murderer, is he? - Oh no! Then he must be in a conspiracy. Mr Meis, are you really what we think you are? Pardon? Not to beat around the bush, are you a spiritualist? A fervent spiritualist? Do you believe in spirits, in ghosts, in the afterlife, ... in magic, in astral bodies? Not really. Mr Meis, thanks to Miss Caporale, who is our medium, ... your eyes will open wide, you will understand. Can you possibly deny that the dead are able to... ... appear before us in a way that's irrefutable? I can't deny it. I even came across a dead man once who was peeling potatoes. I hope he was peeling them better than you! One, 2, 3, 4, 5. Trouble. One, 2, 3, 4, 5. Big trouble. Caporale, I wanted to ask you something. What? Listen... - I'm so unhappy. - I know. How do you know? - I can see it in the cards. - Stop making a joke of it. You've always been a good friend to me. Tell me what you think. I won't ever be able to marry Papiano. I can tell that from the cards too. The marriage has to be stopped. Because you're in love with a young man with blonde hair. There he is! Yes. I'm in love with that young, blonde man. I can only say it to you. You won't tell anyone? It's hard to keep a secret, isn't it? Yes. So, you have to tell him! I don't dare. He intimidates me. He's so strange, if only you knew... Sometimes he's joking around, and then all of a sudden clams up. Yes. He must be ill. Do you think so? I'm sure of it. You have the same sickness. I think I could summon up the courage to talk to him. But how can I do it? Papiano spies on me. He must suspect something. Help me, Caporale. It's really easy. Tomorrow, I'll be ill. So my pigeons will be starving. You'll have to go to feed them. Maybe you'll meet Mr Meis in the park as if by chance... Do you think I'll get to meet him? My cards say you will. Caporale, you're a darling. Louise? Where are you off to? Are you going out? Miss Caporale is ill. - I'm doing her a favour. - Very well, darling. Mr Adrien Meis. 12, Via Sistine. Rome. There. Come in! - Do you mind if I come in? - Not at all. Excuse me, Mr Meis. - I'm feeling a bit unwell. - Really? Would you be so kind as to go and feed my pigeons? - I'll only scare them. - No, they'll understand that... ... you've come instead of me. They'll be happy to see you. - It will bring you good luck. - Do you think so? I'm sure of it. Thank you. Thank you. I thought you were ill? I am. I'm feeling dizzy. My head's spinning, I have to lie down. Hmm... Have a drink and you'll feel better. No thanks. Tell me, how did you first meet Meis? In the park. Where I go to be with my pigeons. - He tried it on with you, didn't he? - Don't be stupid! - He was out walking. - Really? Just like that? Well, yes, just like that. - He was staying at the hotel opposite. - Which hotel? - The Luxor, I think. - He was staying at the Luxor? Do you need anything, darling? No, why? I thought you were feeling ill. - Mr Meis? - Mr...? - Meis. I'd like to talk to him. - Which one? What do you mean? Is there more than one Meis in your hotel? No, they've both left. Both! How unfortunate. I wanted to speak to Mr Adrien Meis. He left on the first of the month. The day that his cousin arrived. - His cousin? - Octavio, who came with his family. Octavio... How unfortunate that they left. Did Mr Meis get a lot of mail? - Which one? - Adrien Meis. Adrien Meis? No, there was never anything for him. That's right. Even though he stayed a whole year. - That's... - Strange! - Yes. - That's the right word. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Miss Caporale's pigeons won't die of hunger today! Have you been sent here too? Yes. I was assigned to duty. And I thought that you must have volunteered! As you were already in position, I could have turned around. But you're staying now? It's nice. For the pigeons. Listen, Louise... I've been wanting to tell you... Say it. Oh no, I can't. Would you like me to help? No, don't say anything. You're scaring me. Don't be afraid, Louise. What can you do... If sincerity was all you needed, life would be quite simple. What's wrong? Pardon me. Let's not talk about it any more. It's better that way. Don't you think so? As you wish. Two pigeons loved each other, ... one got bored. And without further ado, flew away ... up into the sky. And for a whole year... caught up in illusions... found nothing but trouble and misery... that poor pigeon. It's a nice tune, isn't it? - Oh! - You don't need an explanation. Excuse me, I'm a bit late. Ha ha! Did you have a nice stroll? Do you like pigeons, Louise? You too, Meis? They can be quite delicious served for lunch. With garden peas. By the way Meis, I met a friend of yours this morning. A relative. Your cousin Octavio Meis. Charming fellow. Do you have a cousin in Rome, Meis? Tell him to join us here... there are rooms available. Why yes, my cousin... my dear cousin Octavio. Yes, yes, yes. Is he still in Rome? Obviously, since I spoke to him! Yes, of course. Did he show you the tree? The tree? What tree? The Meis family tree! He's convinced that we're descended from an astrologer in the Middle Ages. It's an obsession of his. He's totally crazed! So, was he hounding you? Yes. And I can't stand lunatics. As well as indiscreet people. You're right about that, Mr Meis. - Let's go to the table. - With pleasure. - It's set for tonight, Mr Meis. - What is? Our seance. And we're counting on you to join us. You know all that stuff puts me off, I don't believe in it. Come just this once, as a favour to me. You too, Louise. Miss Pepita! We're not here to dance the quadrille. Try to be a bit more serious. Paleari, sit over there. Miss Pepita, over here. And Béraldez, on my left. - And you, doctor... - Next to you, right? I'm putting you there. I came for your sake. Good evening. A letter for Mr Meis. You're going to keep quiet about this, right? What an imbecile. Listen. Take this, and keep your ears open. - So what happens now? - Be patient, Mr Meis. We'll start as soon as Papiano gets here. What's he up to this evening? - Doctor, would you be good enough to...? - Gladly. Papiano? I'm coming, my friends! Above all, Mr Meis, I ask that you concentrate as hard as you can. Excuse me, my friends. Sit here. The lamp. Like that. Silence. Let's form a circle. Our hands should touch the table slightly. The tip of your little finger should touch your neighbour's. How do you feel, Meis? Oh, strangely moved, Papiano. - Moved. - Hmm. What about you? Me? Oh! Very calm. Be quiet, for goodness sake! Are you in a trance, Miss Caporale? Yes. Quick! What do you see? The Great Max is approaching. He's greeting me. He's going to speak! Mr Meis! - What an idiot! - The circle has been wrecked. What is it? There's a letter for you, Mr Meis! Give it to me! Thank you. Now, leave us! Go on and read it if you like... - ... we don't mind. - No. No, let's continue. What a coincidence, the letter arriving just now! As you are a sceptic, Mr Meis, ...the Great Max must be trying to win you over. We could ask him for the name of the sender. Wouldn't that be... - ... indiscreet? - He'll tell us. I'd stake my life on it. Max knows everything! Speak, Miss Caporale. Do you see this letter, Max? Do you see it? Could you tell me who sent it? Speak, Max. We're listening. Can you hear anything? He's remaining silent. It's as if he doesn't want to speak. He's angry. There are sceptics present. Maybe this letter doesn't interest him. Maybe it isn't signed. Maybe it's anonymous. Ah! The Great Max gave three knocks. What does that mean? It's a sign of asking a question. Maybe he wants you to open the letter? Turn the light on! This is scandalous. Scandalous! Good night. He's right. It's scandalous, it's disgusting! You have no right to pry into his private life! It seems no-one can do anything here without everybody finding out! I feel sick. But, my child, this is a seance... A seance? It seems more like espionage to me! And rudeness! Are you leaving? Are you going away without a word to me? Without saying goodbye? Louise... Come on, I've worked it out... there's something that's keeping us apart. Do you have a secret? Tell me what it is if you love me. No, don't ask me to do it, I have to leave. Yes, yes. Don't say anything... ... if you're not in a position to, if you shouldn't. - But don't abandon me. - No, Louise, ... I beg you! No. You don't love me. Louise... If you leave, I'll follow you. We'll travel, we'll leave Italy if we have to. We'll leave everything behind. You'll forget your secret. I'll help you do it. Papiano... Papiano... Yes, darling. We'll go together. Right away, if you wish. Tomorrow morning, at 7 o'clock... Be ready then. I'm ready now. My money's gone. Someone broke into my desk. What? How? Louise... we can't leave. Oh! Papiano's behind this! I'm sure of it! I'm going to the police. - You can report him. - I beg you, Louise... Let's wait. Papiano might not have done it. There's no evidence that he did. Wait for me. Louise? Thief! You took the money! You're a thief! Just hold on there, Louise! Are you up already? But why are you dressed to go on a trip? You did it! You! Give the money back to Mr Meis! What are you saying, darling? What money are you talking about? Count Papiano is a thief! A thief! A thief! - A thief? Let's get the police. - Yes, let's do it! Indeed. Let's go to the police. Louise, don't lose your head. You can't accuse people just like that. Count Papiano can't possibly have done it. No. It's not him. And who knows? Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Excuse me. What's going on, for the love of God? I don't know. Mr Meis lost some money. - Are there thieves here? - Yes, there is one. It's you. I found my money! It was in a different spot... under a stack of linen, in the chest of drawers. I apologise. To you, Louise. And to you, Papiano. Excuse me. It's not true. It's not true! Nobody's telling the truth. Mr Meis hasn't found anything. - It's Papiano who took the money. - You need to calm down. He's crazy. This Meis is a madman. - I fear the worst. - The worst? Yes. Let's face it. His conscience isn't clear. He doesn't want the police to stick their noses into his affairs. I hope you're wrong! Thief! Give me back my money immediately! Well, well! It was true. Papiano... - Hmm? - Get out! You hear? Get out! Or I'll have you arrested. I'd like to defend myself, if I may. Were you intending to steal my fiancée? - Yes. - I did it to stop you. - Did you want to leave with Louise? - With her consent. We love each other. - There was no other way. - Oh, really? - Two of us is one too many. - Agreed. Exactly. It's up to Louise to decide this. As her guardian, I've always looked to her happiness. She will choose between you. I'll talk to her right away. You've won, Mr Meis. Louise loves you, and she will marry you. But you just announced that you found the money, ... and apologised to me. - Are you so afraid of the police? - Shut up! Careful! You almost strangled me. The police getting involved would upset you. It would be rather indiscreet, wouldn't it? I don't care who you are! That only concerns Louise! My dear, all these engagement parties make me want... - Watch out, doctor! - ... to sit down and eat. - We're not yet engaged. - He doesn't want to marry me any more. In eight days' time, darling, I swear. - Once I've sold my paintings. - Oh, well... Very well, everyone's here! Are you waiting for someone? What a silly question! The fiancé, of course. Oh... Oh, Mr Meis! His door is open, and the room is empty. - I think the bird has flown. - What are you saying? - That's crazy! - I'm telling you the truth. You're lying! That's impossible. You're wonderful. You've arranged everything... ... without asking Mr Meis for his opinion. Has he definitely agreed to marry Louise? Stop talking, I beg you. Go away, I don't want to see you again. Calm down, Louise. Let's take a calm look at the situation. Meis had no reason to leave like that without telling a soul. He should have let us know, your father and me. We have no alternative but to go to the police. I'll go and find some gendarmes! Can't you just shut up? Please listen to me. Do you want to tell me something? Yes. Come with me. I'm listening. You know the whole story, don't you? Yes. No, I don't know anything. But I beg you, leave Adrien alone. Since you're protecting him, is he guilty of something? Leave him alone. Since he's gone... ...and I feel sure that he'll never come back, there's no reason to accuse him of anything. If I don't take it any further, what will you do? Whatever you want, Papiano. Do you want to kill yourself, Mathias? Don't do anything so foolish. It's not Mathias Pascal who needs to be killed, but the other fellow, Adrien Meis. Go back to Miragno. Take your real life back, and your real name. You'll knock on the door of your home: "Here I am, I'm Mathias Pascal." "And I'm alive." Let's go... Say goodbye to Adrien Meis once and for all... ... and get rid of him. Goodbye, Louise. Forgive me. - Who's there? - Me! Who's me? Me! Mathias Pascal! Come and let me in straight away, you old hag! What? What are you saying? Oooh! Well, well! Pomino. Mathias! - What are you doing here? - Me? Uh... What about you? So you're not dead? Of course I am. I'm dead. I'm dead. You haven't answered my question. What are you doing here... - ... at this hour of the night? - I'm married. Ah? And you're spending the night away from your wife? No. Listen... Oh, my head... Listen... I married... It's awful! Who? Who did you marry? Romilda. - Romilda? - Mmm... You? You married my wife? Hah! That's the last straw. When did it happen? When... You should understand. She remarried... ... after what happened, that event. You have to understand. Anyway... But... I... - You... you... - Shut up, you old bag. Go and tell my wife to come here. Get going, or else! So when did you get married? Go on, tell me. Ten months after your d... At any rate, after we legally could. They say that the dead go quickly... ... but that the living are in a greater hurry! But where have you been? What have you been doing all this time? I've been dead, you know. - It's been difficult. - Don't you have a jacket? No, I lost it. What a nightmare! What are we going to do? Why has he been gone for so long? And why has he come back? - Has he changed? - Changed? Unrecognisably. He's well dressed, and well-groomed. He speaks with the force of a thunderbolt! - He's unrecognisable. - What has he told you? He scolded me! That's right, he scolded me! So? Is my wife coming? Yes. I'm hungry. I'm hungry! - Isn't there anything else? - No. Uh, actually, there's also... Bring me whatever else there is! This is my aunt Scholastica's dinner service! Isn't it? How could that be? Oh, right. You don't know. She's... Say it. Are you afraid of the word? - She's dead, isn't she? - Yes. She was a very good woman. Poor Scholastica. But then, in my absence... - ... Romilda inherited everything? - Obviously. Did you expect us to give it all away to the nuns? Indeed not. This is quite a mess we're in, don't you think? You know what the law says? When the first husband, who was thought to be dead, reappears... ...the second marriage is annulled. Automatically annulled. So, I, I...? Romilda? Mathias! A child? Yes. It's Pomino's. You're beautiful, Romilda. You're still beautiful. Why are you staring at me like that? Am I scaring you? Oh! My beard and my moustache! Yes, I shaved them off. I look different now. It doesn't suit me, right? Yes, it does. It makes you look younger. But tell me, what have you been up to all this time? Why haven't you been in touch since your disappearance? - You know that we... buried... - Yes, I know. You knew? - What's wrong with you? - I find that funny! Extremely funny! Aren't you ashamed of yourself, crying in front of him? Calm down, Pomino. For our marriage to be annulled... ... Mathias would have to make a formal demand. Which he won't do. He'll take pity on us. What a touching family scene! Goodness, you must be rich now! Don't be afraid, Romilda. Mathias doesn't want you back. He would have to share his dough. Mathias doesn't want us to be unhappy. He understands. I'm leaving, Romilda. I'll go away. Excuse me for disrupting your happy existence. What did you come for? I came to give you a hug, dear mother-in-law. But, in all honesty, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Run after him, you idiot! He's poking fun at us. Make him stay away! - How? - I don't know. But make sure he never comes back. Mathias! Mathias... What do you want? She doesn't believe you. She thinks that you'll be back. That I'll come back? Me? - If you came back... - You would be ruined! It's not that. But what would people say? I'd never be able to go back to the town hall. The town hall? Do you still work there? - Yes. - What do you do there? - I work in the Public Records Office. - The Public Records Office? Perfect! What is it? - You really want me to leave? - Yes. - And never come back? - Yes. Do what I tell you... ... and I promise that no-one will ever hear of Mathias Pascal again. - What do I need to do? - Let's go to the town hall. Get some council letterhead and a seal, and let's get to work. I can't do this, it's too risky. You promised to do me a favour. Aren't you going to keep your word? Mathias, I... I swear on my own grave that you're going to do as I say! If you don't, I'll take up again with Romilda. And everyone in Miragno will laugh at you. I can't... I can't ever be involved in forgery. - Me, the mayor's son... - You only ever think... ... of yourself! What about me? I want a name. A certified, legalised name. Authenticated with all your stamps. - I'm nothing without that document. - But it can't be done... As it stands, if I meet a woman, fall in love with her... ... I have to run away, like a thief, or an outcast! - Yes, but... - Enough said! Give me a way to survive... or I'll take back what you took from me. So... what name do you want? Adrien Meis. Why Adrien Meis? Why not Adrien Meis? How do you write that? Well... Adrien and Meis. M-E-I-S. Born in Miragno, on the same date as me... of course. What about your parents? No Meis has ever lived here. Write 'Father unknown'. His mother, a farm girl, left the area three months later. What is it you're making me do... ? A good deed, Pomino. You'll get your reward... in heaven, when you join us up there. Papiano! Papiano! The gendarmes! The gendarmes? What's going on? I saw him. He's in Rome. What's that supposed to mean? Why are you getting mixed up in this, you idiot? You asked us to look for a certain Mr Meis? No, it's a misunderstanding. - Don't listen to that idiot. - There he is! Who? - Him, that's who! - So, are you the missing person? Me, missing? As you can see, here I am. Oh, Mr Meis! You're back! Is this gentleman really Mr Meis? - Yes! - So, there's nothing left to talk about. As a matter of fact, there is. Mr Meis, that's easy to say, isn't it? How do you know that he is Meis? I've never seen any papers proving it. Hmm? What? I know, my dear Papiano... that you've always had an interest in me... ... bordering on the unhealthy. But, anyway, here are my papers. Have a good look. Maybe they're fake. They seem fine. Ha ha! But you should also ask where he got the money that he's hiding. - Ask him where it came from. - Oh! Oh, Mr Meis... And now, if Mr Papiano wants to press charges... ... he knows who I am. Excuse us, gentlemen. It's all a misunderstanding. - But, but... - A simple misunderstanding! You can go, gentlemen. To be precise, I am the late Mathias Pascal. What are you saying? The truth. - You're scaring me. - Yes. The late Mathias Pascal... buried... ... erased from the rolls of the living. I don't understand, darling. Explain it to me. I have my whole life to do so. - No, tell me right away. - You want me to? It's a strange story. Once upon a time in Miragno... ... there was a young man, ... very kind, ... a bit slow. He was always... ... chasing butterflies.
