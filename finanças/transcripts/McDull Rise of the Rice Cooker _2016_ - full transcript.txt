The human race is on the precipice of extinction There's no one to help us except ourselves Let us put together our wisdom and courage To create a bigger robot to meet this challenge As our enemy is an unknown We have no specific strategies Here I entreat each and every Earthling To come up with your design for the robot The robot that you design... Could very well be the nemesis of the outerspace monster That's right! It could be you! Protect our Earth, our homeland! Earth! Earth! I will design a super robot To protect the Earth and save the human race For wonton noodles, McKee Go straight, turn left, that's Ying Kee For Tofu pudding, McKee Go straight, make a turn, that's Kai Kee For fishballs and chicken feet, McKee Go straight, cross the road, that's Dull Jai Kee For fish congee and beef brisket, McKee Kong Jai Kee, mail for you Go straight, cross the road, that's Sung Kee Lee On Kee, mail for you Hon Kee Morning Morning For sponge cakes, McKee Go straight, turn left, that's Kun Kee For baked pork chops with fried rice, McKee Chiu Fat, mail for you Morning Go straight, make a turn, that's Bing Kee What delicious fishballs & chicken feet, McKee Go straight, cross the road, that's Dull Jai Kee For foods that make you feel full, McKee Dull Jai Kee! Hey! Watch out, four-eyes! Let's get some ice cream after the meal Sigh... (Three Days Ago) Mcdull, hanging clothes? Yummy! Yummy! Everybody eats! Everybody eats! You eat I don't eat! You eat I don't eat! No! No! Good, very good The summer vacation will begin in a few days You have learned in the previous year... The fundamentals of salting fish... Mixing fish meat and making fishballs Next year We will be teaching you advanced skills in... Salting fish, mixing fish meat and making fishballs There are summer courses over the next two months... In salting fish, mixing fish meat and making fishballs Which I urge you to join You may return to your classrooms Goodbye, Mr. Principal Your fishballs are disgusting! Don't you help out in your mom's shop? No, she doesn't want me to Says it's really hard work All the more reasons to help her. You're impossible No. Mom wants me to spend more time... On inventing a machine that you just plug it in, And fishballs will come out There can never be such machines Stop dreaming! All the more reasons to invent it I am an inventor Inventor? You ever saw an inventor... That has a pig head on his neck? Mcdull, hanging clothes? Meal time! Mom, come see my new invention. Let's eat first. When you eat fishball skewers The skewer always gets your throat at the last fishball But if there are tines on the skewer... With one fishball on each tine... Then your throat won't get hurt. Right? Like chicken feet? Right. There are no such skewers. No? Why don't you ask those factories? OK. Let me write to them Let's have dinner first! OK. Mom, it's so good Oh, right. Here Eh? Science Duckling! Mom, How did you know about this magazine? Toto told me. He said... Mom, look This guy Newton, he's a pighead And this Edison Look, what a pighead Read it after dinner, pighead Mom, let's visit Toto tomorrow Again? It's OK. He said it's OK. Mom, please! (Two Days Ago) OK Auntie Shrimp Mcdull! Didn't you say you'd invent something for me? I'm working on it. Any day now Toto! Mcdull, going to town? That's fine. This came in two days ago Guess what? An electric nose hair shaver Stick it inside your nostrils, turn it on... And it shaves off all your nose hairs Here, remove the cover And it becomes a peeler, for potatoes, carrots... Even the dead skin on your feet Put the cover back on, and it's a nose hair shaver again Wow! Mom, let's buy this Nose hair, Potatoes and dead skin, three-in-one! Oh, and this Military strength light wave oven It can roast chickens and bake sweet potatoes Ah, and this is even better! Ever did the hula hoop sitting down? Voila! Hula stool! Sit on it, and the stool starts twisting this way and that Twisting this way and that just like doing hula hoop Exercising, eating sweet potatoes and... Foot massage, all at the same time! Want to try? Mom, I want to try Here is the speed control This knob controls the directions Mom, this is great! The Science Duckling has arrived Thank you so much Science Duckling is good stuff If I didn't read it... as a kid and... Became interested in machines and electronics I'd still be salting fish in the village This silly boy Said he wanted to become an inventor An inventor? Mcdull wants to become an inventor I think I'm going to throw up milk (One Day Ago) Choo...choo...choo...choo Mcdull look. Newton, he's not a pighead And Edison, look No way he looks like a pighead Hello! I'd like some fishballs please We got business! Phew! One stick of fishballs please Goodness, what is this? Our invention, chicken feet fishballs How very disgusting OK, piggy How about a stick without the chicken feet? Hey! We've got a problem! Friend of the Earth, Savior of the Universe Superman, transform! Choo...choo...choo...choo Gosh! You know any inventor who's a retard? No So disgusting. I'm not eating it Okay okay. Let's go to other shops Did you see? When I grow up I'll never become a bitch! (The Same Day) Our invention, chicken feet fishballs Yuck! How disgusting! It's really ingenious It won't poke your throat, and you get a chicken paw This is too disgusting. Let's go Piggy piggy, don't be angry... Bitch S! O! R! R! Y! S! O! R! R! Y! Sor-ry What you just saw wasn't a television program A little while ago An outerspace monster invaded our planet, wreaking havoc And booted Spamerman, our friend of peace and justice... Out into outer space I repeat What you just saw wasn't some silly program for the ignoramus Attention, all pupils of Fresh Fish Primary School Attention, all pupils of Fresh Fish Primary School This is an emergency announcement from the principal All pupils please immediately assemble in the playground The Earth is at the precipice of extinction! As the supreme academy of learning of this village We also must do our share... In this sacred mission of saving the Earth This summer's activities, including salting fish and making fishballs, will all be cancelled Instead, we will design fighting robots! Your designs Will enter the Global Super Robot Competition Your projects may be implemented... To defeat the outerspace monster, And save our planet! Earth! Earth! Earth! Earth! Earth! Earth! Earth! I will design a super robot To protect the human race, and save the Earth! Mom, we sent out Our robot designs today Really? What have you designed? Why don't you first show it to mom? My robot. He can do this to the monster Chi-ley-kong-long! What's that? It's like this: chop chop chop chop! Bong bong bong bong! And cheeee! That'll get him I don't think I get you Mom... Do you think the monster prefer rice or noodles? How would I know? But mom... Do you know how the monster Cuts his toenails? His toenails must be so big and thick... Maybe with an electric saw? Wow, he'll cut himself Well, serves him right. He's the monster What if his ass itches? What his ass itches? I mean, the monster's arms are so short He can't reach his ass if it itches What do you care about the monster reaching his ass? Right, mom! I have something for you It's for you Wow! Dried abalone Good for braising chicken feet Haha... I learned it from this edition of Science Duckling It's handmade soap It'll make the skin of your hands so smooth But only for a while No. Your hands will become smooth forever It's Newton's Law of Inertia! Really? Why, thank you! Now go to sleep And you... Moon Sea Ships Hand Mom Mom (One month later) And now the good news Results of the Global Robot Design Contest have come in Out of the hundreds and thousands of entries A pupil of Fresh Fish Primary School, Mcdull Right. Mcdull of Dull Jai Kee His design has been shortlisted and given the go ahead to produce a small robot from his design... And take part in the Finals at the renowned institution MIT But... who can help him make the robot? We interviewed the only expert in our village Dull Jai Kee, that's awesome! Hong Kee from Hong Kee Hydroelectric Engineering Co. I can only change lightbulbs Maybe go into town and ask Toto? No, I can't. How about Hong Kee? That's all right To get shortlisted is already an amazing achievement Here we congratulate Dull Jai Kee Mrs. Mak, Mcdull... What are your plans? I have no plans. We probably go out for a meal Only a meal? What more can I do? Look! Your legs are so smooth There's not a hair on it What kind of razor did you use? Toto's nose hair shaver And it gave you such smooth legs? That's laser What? Hair removal by laser, mole removal too Yes, I am a hermit scientist I am quite capable of making a small robot But honestly I'd spent all my money on this laser machine It will depend on you to foot the bills for the robot How much would that be? Including parts, airfare, room & board, etc. 80,000 to 100,000 80,000 to 100,000? That's making an extra 10,000 catty of fishballs Personally I'm not so keen on all this trouble But as I study Mcdull's design Going over it again and again I think Perhaps Mcdull wasn't born to be a scientific genius His design may not save the Earth But I think there's a very special innocence... About his views on technology... And that more people should know about it I don't know how to say it You're his mom, you call the shots I am already dirt poor as it is Don't worry. There's no interest. Tell Mcdull to work hard But that isn't right? It's very right Mama, Mama Your eyes love me You see me on Earth and in South Pole Mama, Mama You close your eyes and see me You see me in dreams on a full moon But one day I will drift away From Nigeria to Antalya But Mama, Mama You will see me See me on the Earth and in craters Mcdull, you crying? No...I got sand in my eyes... From Tutunendo to Baltimore But Mama, Mama Mcdull! You close your eyes and see me Make good! You see me in dreams on a full moon Mom loves you! We are here at MIT, where the Finals will take place From up here we can see The convoy arriving. Carrying the robots from around the world What're you doing here in the middle of the night?

Hi everyone, it's me again The ambassador of peace, the personification of justice From the Planet Galanta, Spamerman I have devised a new move: The Upside-down Sausage... To take care of the monster But guess I am a little late the Upside-down Sausage... What a bummer. So why don't I... Engage my beautiful voice to relieve you of your doldrums Uncle Fai, please The mountain is quiet and the moon is alone, remember There's passion in the heart The wind passes and the flower wilts, remember The passion in my heart will not die Remember our dinner, Mcdull (A Year Later) (Early Spring) Afterwards you said you wanted to die Love dissipates but my heart remembers How you suddenly open your heart, in tears It's really in the doldrums A year went by. The monster has not returned Normalcy returns And it's like nothing has ever happened But where has Risobot gone? Nobody knows Why did the designer Mcdull... Invent this piece of home applicance... to challenge the monster? Nobody understands People return to work or school But everyone feels a little depressed Everyone is missing Risobot After our feast your thoughts turned dark Love dissipates but my heart remembers Then one day A robot received a broken message... From some stars or planets The experts patched it together, and it said... Mr. Principal, Mcdull, friends, this is Risobot I am now living on the monster's planet. I am well They like me a lot, and using my designs... Invented many vacuum cleaners, ventilators and massagers Their days are quiet and they are happy So they stay home and stop invading other planets They also started growing rice The first harvest is expected this autumn If there's anything missing here... Here they have nine suns, but no moon What I miss most, is the Earth And the moon hanging over the slopes The experts are divided over this message Some say it's authentic, some say no... And consider it Risobot's thought remnants... While Risobot has long become space rubbish But Dull Jai Kee, Mcdull, is convinced that... The one thing most worthy of pursuit, Is to let you and the people around you live a good life They'd include: Monster, Spamerman Uncle Dragon... Gen. O'Leannain... Dr. M... Bitch... Mom... Suk Yin... The Principal... Auntie Shrimp... Hong Kee... Toto... Uncle Fai... April... Icy... Lenni... Miss Chan... The President... Risobot, thank you! Life... We will live a good life... Mcdull! When I grow up I'll marry you!
