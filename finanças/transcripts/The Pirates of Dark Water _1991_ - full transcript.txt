There, I saw it again Ren! Come down from up there! No, I think I see someone out there! Ren, enough foolishness! Do I have to drag you inside? Wait! If somebody's out there, I have to make sure! So where is this fool who would brave such a storm? There, by the rocks! Look! He's alive, he made it to the shore! Ren, wait! No, Bloth, you'll never take me again! You're safe now, old man. I'm a friend. Blast his soul to the abyss, he's been helped! He was your charge and you allowed him to escape! Bloth, most majesty! For 17 years I have guarded him and never a mistake! I took my eye off him for but a moment... And a moment is all you've left to live. No, NO! Eat well, my pet! Are you hungry? I'll make you a deal... Tell me, this is Octopon. It is. Then the circle is complete... Come on, let me get you inside. There's no time. Look to Octopon...what do you see? I s-see the c-city reborn! No, you see your destiny. Only you can bring our city back to its former glory. Go to the one called Alomar. Tell him Primus has escaped the pirate king Bloth. Alomar? Where will I find this man? Seek him in fire and smoke, Ren...my son. Old man! So all I could do was comfort him in his final moments. Clearly he'd lost his mind, but... for some reason I felt a powerful bond with him. It's because he knew you, Ren. It was I who looked after you these 17 years, but it was Primus the King who fulfilled his prophecy and returned to his son. He was your father. My father? And that which was his is now yours. What is my role in this prophecy? You've spent your youth tending the flames of this lighthouse. Now you will be the guiding light for all Octopon. If you know all this, then you must know where I can find the one called Alomar. The one you seek dwells within the Abbey of Galdebar. Ren! Let me go, let me go you My meal looks...undercooked. Just one moment, what about my food? We had a deal! The deal was for you to bring me the old man. Old man, young man, what's the difference? I wanna be fed! Niddler, when have I ever lied to you? I'll feed you, to the constrictus! Put an end to him! This won't be the last you see of me, fish-lips! I apologize for this outburst. I hope my guest understands that the pressures of leadership weigh heavily. Why have you brought me here? I saw your heroic rescue of the old man. I had to meet you! Did you know him? Intimately. He was a long term...guest of mine. Then...you would be Bloth. Yes...but you have me at a disadvantage. I don't know who you are. That's not important. Oh, but it is if the old man told you more than my name secrets, perhaps? Then why should I tell his jailer information he died to protect? Enough of this dancing about! The old man hid the Thirteen Treasures of Rule within the realm of Dark Water and I mean to have them! You won't get any help from me! What? The Treasure's no good to a dead man why won't you join me? The old man was my father. Was he now? And I thought I had eliminated all his heirs well, here's an opportunity to finish the job! He is as stubborn as his father. Stop him! Noo! Bloth, you'll have to do better than that to catch me! I shouldn't have been so quick to boast... You can run no farther, Son of Primus. Well, looks like you're in a bit of a spot! Yes, and I wonder who it was that got me into it? If you want revenge against Bloth, help me escape! After them! Release the dagrons! Bring me that monkeybird's head. I owe you my life, Niddler. You have my deepest thanks. Keep your thanks I only saved you on the chance you could find me some food. But there's no time for that! The future of Octopon in my hands! Funny, my greep seems to be getting weaker All right, all right! I know where we can find some food. It's called the Abbey of Galdebar. Galdebar? Hmm...that doesn't sound very appetizing... Is this the place? I think so! I hope you're right, my stomach's growling! But this place is deserted! You lied to me... Who dares enter the Abbey of Galdebar? Two hungry travelers! Shh! I am Ren, son of King Primus. Good story, that makes us sound important! Why have you come? It was the will of my father. What do you seek? You. Alomar. Wrong! Oh, bad answer! I am not Alomar, but he is here. Oh, great! Maybe now we eat! In darkness and in light, this will be your guide. Alomar awaits. What kind of man would live like this? Maybe he's a meat-eater. Alomar! Yes? Alomar! Call off your beast! I am Alomar! You? I expected a A man? You have a lot to learn, Son of Primus. It is not only men who direct the fate of this world. Forgive my ignorance. I know of the Thirteen Treasures of Rule, but how do I find them? And once found, what do I do with them? All will be revealed. Thirteen Treasures of Ancient Time Thirteen Lessons of Rule in Rhyme To find the jewels in secret places Follow where the Compass faces If returned from the shore beyond A new day dawns for Octopon But if they fall into evil hands Darkness descends on all the lands For these riches two shall vie In the realm of Dark Water where the Treasures lie What's that last part mean? There is another seeking the Treasure of Rule. Don't waste another moment, go! Thank you for your cooperation, Your Holiness. Flee! I will see that you're safely away! Alomar! Look out! You should have run, when you had the chance it's too late for me No! Fifty gold pieces to the swab who takes the boy's life. I want that Compass! You'll have to earn the gold pieces before you can spend 'em! Now's our chance! Come on! I can't just yet! Oh, please, Bloth, prince of villians, monarch of the seas and all that swims and... Monkeybird, save your breath. Pretty nice marksmanship, eh, Niddler? You could've skewered me! Shall we go after them, Bloth? No, curse you, find me some water! The Compass is still pointing out to sea so I guess the first order of business is to buy a boat. Any ideas? Well, if you think I'm going to carry you there, forget it! No, I've got another idea... You've been sitting here for over an hour. If you're not going to eat, leave! My friend is having trouble selecting from your large bill of fare. I don't know why the innkeeper tolerates these things. I'll be back. Maybe we should eat as long as we're here Don't start that now! We can't lose sight of our This is it. I still say you're reading it wrong! This is north! No! This is north! Hmph, with your sense of direction, we'll never find the Treasure! Shh. Perhaps I may be of assistance? I don't think it's any of your business! I don't talk to mutant beasts. Uh, wait wait wait, we didn't order anything. No. He did. A gesture of friendship. What makes you think we need a friend? These eyes can spot landlubbers who could use the experience of a true seaman. And these ears know when they hear talk of Treasure. Ahh, this is men's business, off with you, wench! You have a boat? The finest in the harbor, for a cut of the take. 70-30? 80-20. 60-40! 50-50! Done and done. Call me Ioz. Wait a minute! Now what do I get out of this? Three meals a day, monkeybird and my promise not to pluck you bald! What more could I want? She's a beauty! What's her name? Uh, the Wraith. Hurry with that. We must sail with the tide. Thieves! Stop them! Stop them, they're getting away! They're stealing my boat! We're casting off! Ren, take the wheel! Ioz, what's this all about? You'd think we stole this boat... ...we did! What? Steer for open water! What? Five days at sea and now you tell me the map's a fake? Well, we're all full of surprises, aren't we? Oh! What is this witchcraft? We must be near the first of the hidden Treasures! Ahh, then there are riches to be found! Yes, the Thirteen Treasures of Rule! Bilge! They're nothing but a myth! Tell that to the Compass. The First Treasure must be beyond those rocks. God's Tears! You didn't say anything about the bloody Dragon's Maw! No treasure's worth dying for. Bloth. You know that sun-blistered sea scavenger? Yes, and you? Used to crew for him, ended ugly. Why am I not surprised? Look out! This is a swift craft. We can outrun him in the open sea. No. We're within reach of the First Treasure. We're going into the Dragon's Maw. Well, one of you had better decide before we have the ship burn out from underneath us. I wanted to get away from the drudgery of life on land. Oh, and now a woman aboard! And it looks like I picked the right ship. I'm Tula! Well, uh, Tula, I'm throwing you overboard! No, we need every hand. Look! We must slow the Wraith. We need less sail. What does a serving wench know of sailing? Now aren't you glad you didn't throw her overboard? Halt! I see something ahead on the starboard bow a light of some sort! The First Treasure of Rule! Perfect! They're leading us to the First Treasure! Quick, Niddler! Get the gem! Twist my soul! Keep that monkeybird from getting the gem! Niddler! Boy! There are twelve Treasures left join me and we'll find them together! Never! Incredible! Insanity, you mean, I'm surprised we came through it safely. Not all of us. We were four, now we're three. Niddler! You're all right! Your failure to take the first gem is my victory! It's not a victory for you or me, but one for Octopon! Konk, take the scout ship, and get that Treasure! I can't ask you to continue with me on this dangerous quest. Name the port of your choice and I'll take you there. Which way does the Compass point? To the second Treasure of Rule, east. Then east it is, for adventure! For Treasure! For Octopon! For crying out loud! When are we gonna eat?
