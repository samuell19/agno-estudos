Hey, you're gonna treat me today, since you ignored my page and I hid you. Got it? Come with me. Who is she fucking around with? What time do you think it is? Look at the time, and dinner's not even ready. You know your old man loses it when you're late. I'm about to, can't you see the grocery? Give me 10 bucks.

Have you seen my bank book? It's not in the drawer or the closet. Has your mother run off with it again? I got shot in Vietnam to make that money! What if she's spending all that on other men? Dad, you gave it to me to take care of it. I'm managing it well. Don't worry, eat. Oh, right... Yeah, take care of the house. It's rat poison, isn't it? You're trying to kill me, aren't you? Just because I'm a crippled fuck, you think you can just kill me? Why would I put something in there? I just cooked it with fresh grocery. Why would I want to kill you! Stop picking fight and eat! Eat? So you want me to eat your rat poison and die? You fucking slut, opening up your cunt to everyone. You're just like you're mother. Go find your mom! Now! Where do you think she is? She's dead, don't you remember? I said go find your mom! Go get her! Should I look for it? Haven't found it yet? No, I think we're almost there. You have all day, motherfucker.

You forgot what that means? It's not that... We're busy, I'm giving you 10 seconds. It's up to you to turn us into saints or devils. That's two seconds gone. You motherfucker! He said ten seconds, you fucker! Fuck! It's been only 8 seconds! How many houses left? Six more to go. Make sure you collect it properly. Got it, it's... Hey! Come on, finish up.

If you want to play with other kids you gotta have it. I got it late. You should tell your dad to get it for you. Hey, he doesn't have a dad. His dad beat up his mom and they got divorced and moved out. Then go to your dad without telling your mom and ask him to buy it for you. Hyungdn! Dad bought you some snacks! Are they your friends? Here, eat this together. Idiot, they're not eating it because you're not. My mom must've lied. How come your dad didn't go to work? My mom said people who don't go to work are homeless. Hello?

Kill someone, then rot in jail for 15 years, then you call it even? IS that it? Alright, keep it down. What the fuck you looking at, fucking cunt? - Fuck's your problem? - Hey, come on, stop. You said to me before, right? Orphan bastards would like even a father like that. But you know what? Bastards like me would rather be an orphan. Loud motherfuckers. Drink in peace, god damn bitches. I'll kill a fucker today and find out if I can repent. Where's your mother gone, leaving her daughter to cook dinner. Fucking whore. She neglects her family and runs off somewhere. I told you, mom's not around. Bitch. Why isn't your mom around? I said she's dead. Why do you kill off your mom? Just because she fucks everyone doesn't mean you should think her dead. I said, mom's dead. She's dead! How many times do I have to tell you? Why don't you get it? Mom's dead! She's been dead for years already. Why do you keep bringing it up? Why? I'm going to kill you, you fucking cunt. I'm really going to kill you. Come here. Come over here. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Put it down now. Don't do it. I said, don't do it. Why are you being like this? Why? You fucking cunt. Shit, wake up! Wake up! What the fuck is this. You cunt! What am I! What? Open the door. Open the door. Don't die. You have to live, no matter how hard it is. If you die now, I'm... I'm... Live. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die! Mom... Okay, get ready for the blood transfusion. Take my blood and give it to him! Are you his son? I'm his son, take my blood and give it to him! I'm sorry. I said I'm his son, take my blood! Godammit! Don't leave a single drop, just give it to him! Take my blood and give it to him. Take it! I said, give him my blood. Give it to him. What are you doing up? I was about to sleep. You woke me up. Sorry I called so late. Go to sleep. Why did you call? Let's go for a beer. Forget it, next time. I'll come, where should I go? At least acknowledge me. Stop acting cool. What the? I thought we'd go to a pub. Sometimes you need to drink at a place like this, bitch. It's been a while since I've been here. Especially at this hour. Used to ride my scooter here often in middle school. So you were a thug since middle school. You know, you're acting really weird today. Why do you look so lifeless? I gave blood before coming here, that's why. Gave blood? You? Why? Am I not allowed to give blood? Oh,fight I started a part-time job At a snack bar. Isn't that funny? Treat me on when you get paid. It's weekly salary. I'll call you out soon, see how it is to be treated by a high schooler. But, you really are mean. You ignore my calls when I page you, and only call me when you feel like it. Don't live like that. So how should I live? Teach me how, since you go to school. Alright, it's not hard. First of all... just spend a lot of money on me. Then you'll live a happy life. Messing around with a high school kid... Messing around with a low life gangster. Let me borrow your lap. Don't bother asking. Do your parents live well? Of course. Be nice to them. Don't upset them. You be nice to yours. Stop being a scumbag. They're probably sick and tired because of you. Hey! What, want to pick up a fight so early? I got paid from work yesterday. You never listen. Come on then. Attack. You little bastards! You're dead, you little bastard. Come on, you're so dead! You evil man! Why are you trying to kill him? Little punks, come here! Get over here, little bastards. I'm off. See you next time. Hyungdn. I shouldn't have done that last time... I'm sorry. Don't hit grandpa! Grandpa's nice, why do you hit him? Dad used to... used to hit mom like that... There's a brewery. All the grains from that neighborhood go to that brewery. Who is that? Turn it off. Hello? I'm in class. It's me- You said you 'd treat on your pay day. Huh? I was going to call. You can treat Hyung-in today instead. He '5 in a kindergarten play. Huh? Come out of exit 2 at Daelim Station and you 'll find Omji Kindergarten- See you there at 5. Okay, I got it. Don't be late. I'll get off work early tonight. I got myself a cellphone- I'll give you the number when I see you Hey, tell me now. Not even a chance to talk... What are you doing, fucking cunt! What's with you? Told you to get here by 11. It's half past nine, prick. I know, cunt. So the bastard knows he's early? That's a surprise. Why, what's up? Do you need money? Fucking cunt, is that all you think about? You came to fuck me in the ass while the boys aren't here? Fucker. I don't put out to just everyone, especially not gangsters. Carry on with the cleaning. Fucking bastard. What is it then? Come on, Man-sik. What, you cunt. Man-sik... Come on, motherfucker, spit it out! I'm quitting after today. Have you thought this through carefully? I don't fucking know, bastard. It's not like I don't know you, it's... It's just so sudden, that's all. I don't know... I'm just sick of it all. And I'm enjoying it? Who the fuck works this job because they like it? Man-sik... What? Shit. Godammit. Fine, I'm done. I'm quitting too. Shit, I'm done. I was gonna hand it over to Hong-suk anyway. When he comes I'lljust pass it on. Crazy bastard, stop fucking around. Stop trying to copy me, cunt. Who said I'm copying you? Crazy fucker. If a founding member's quitting, why the fuck am I sticking around? I'm all ready to open up a barbecue restaurant. And saved up enough for your severance. Fucking cunt, dammit. You've been tucking shit away without them knowing. That's right, you fucker. I'm the boss, I need to watch out for myself more than the boys. But it's not like I've been screwing them over. Alright. Get here quickly after you finish. Let's go for a drink. Fucker damn. Godammit... This is so sudden. Hwan-gyu called and said he can't come in today. Work with Young-jae, eh? Let's go drink afterwards. And there's someone I want you to meet. Your nephew? That little runt must've grown a lot by now. But who you going to introduce me to? See for yourself later, you fucker. Fuck. I'll go straight to the kindergarten after. See you there. Alright. Let's have some coffee. This looks like it. Sang-hoon, take your sister inside. Let's go. You know who we are, right? Give us what we came for. We're busy. I've got some money coming in next week. I'll definitely pay you then. Don't fuck around, cunt. Do you have money in the bank? Go put on a coat and come out, we'll wait outside. I really don't have it, please give me one week. Just this once... I really don't have it! I don't fucking have it, for fuck's sake! What do you expect me to do? Son of a bitch! Cunt! Don't! Don't hit him. Don't! Don't hit him! Stop, Young-jae!
