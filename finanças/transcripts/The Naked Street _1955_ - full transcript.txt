Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes This story is true. I ought to know. I not only covered it for my newspaper, I became a part of it. You've read about Phil Regal in the papers. Enforcer for the underworld, they called him. But the real inside story was never told before. No one could possibly tell it until now... ...and stay alive. It started one dismal night... ...under a bridge in a lonely stretch of Brooklyn. Hey! It's a man! And in dousing the body with gasoline, ...the killers overlooked his expensive sport shoes. which enabled the police to identify the murdered man... ...as Julian "Lefty" Fogel, small-time racketeer, most recently employed by Phil Regal in his personal loan business. Ah, you slobs. A lousy little contract like that and you mess it up. We had to do it fast. The one thing I didn't want, identification. - Some people were coming... - Shut up! You guys gotta get out of town. - Where to? - Detroit! See Mr. G. He'll take care of you. - Phil, there's a man waiting... - I told you to stay out of here! There's a newspaperman in the corridor. He insists on seeing you. Name's Joe McFarland, He's the louse that wrote that. Tell him to take a fly... No, bring him in, I'll be right out. Here. Now get out! Hey! That way. See Mr. G. And don't send me no postcards. - McFarland? - Yes, New York Chronicle. Some questions I'd like to ask you, Mr. Regal. Sure, come on in while I get dressed. I don't have much time, kid. I gotta go see my mother and sister... ...over in Brooklyn where they live. Well, I won't keep you long. You know, Sunday night if I show up at dinner, for my old lady it just ain't Sunday. I see you read my story. Yeah, somebody was reading it to me. The D.A. statement, did you read that? No, what did he say? He said, uh... "It is known that Regal polices the Brooklyn underworld for the syndicate. He has been implicated in extorsion, gambling, bookmaking and prostitution." Who does that bum think he is? In every case in which his name has come up... ...witnesses have disappeared or met violent ends. In this latest gang murder, police hope to uncover evidence that will lead directly to the door of Phil Regal, for whose questionable finance company "Lefty" Fogel worked. I thought you might have a statement to make. Look, I'm a legitimate businessman... ...in the personal loan business. Every rap that comes up in this town they try to pin on me. - Is that what you want me to say? - Yeah! If that dumb jerk starts making indictments... ...without corroborating witnesses, he's gonna land right square in his key stack. Alright, I'll word it exactly that way. Yeah, and do me a favor. Verbatim. That's, uh... word for word. - Can I drop you downtown? - Yeah, sure, if you're going that way. Sure, come on. Where are you going? - With you. - Now, Janet, uh... Don't you think it's about time I met your mother and sister? Do you mind waiting for me downstairs? Okay. Look, Phil, every time... You look, I'm telling you for the last time. Maybe you know how to talk good, which fork to use, but you ain't meeting my family. - I'm not good enough for them. - Sure you're good. For me you're very good. When it comes to my family, that's different. Sometimes, Phil, I don't understand you. You understand me. Be back in a couple of hours. Wait for me, huh? Watch the car, son, huh? - Hiya, Louie, how's tricks? - Oh, hello, Mr. Regal! Say, I hope it's nothing serious about your sister Rosalie. - What do you mean serious? - Well, I thought... Well, you see... Me and Nellie, that's my wife, we went over to Dr. Levit's on Thursday... - My wife is having another, you know. - Hey, congratulations. Yeah... So, anyway, your sister she was just coming out when we was coming in. So I thought maybe... I talked to her on Friday, she didn't say anything. - Nah, it couldn't be nothing. - Well... knock on wood. - Seeya, kid. - Yeah. Hey, Mama! Rosalie! - Your boy's here! - Phil, I'm in the kitchen. - Hiya, baby. - Darling. - How's tricks, huh? - Fine. Hey. Phil, you are alright? As long as I can eat goulash and spaetzles with you, I'm alright. Don't eat from the pot. Wait for Rosalie. I'm going to send you and Rosie to Miami for the winter. How many times have I heard that, "I'm going to send you and Rosie to Miami for the winter." - You know Mama won't go. - Hey, how are you, sweetie? - Hey, where've you been? - Oh, I had something to do. Oh, come on, don't bluff me off. - Where've you been? - I went to church. - I said a little prayer for you. - Yeah? That's my Rosie. Come on, let's eat. There. - Phil. - Huh? Bless us our Lord for the gifts we are about to receive... ...from your bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen. Tell me, sweetie, how's the... how's college? I quit. You what? I quit. - What happened? - Nothing, I just don't want to go anymore. - I'm going to get a job. - Listen, Rosalie Regalzyk don't need no job. You got a home, I bought you a car. If you want something else, tell me. Phil, I just want to stand on my own two feet. I can't go on taking things from you forever. What's the use of having dough if I can't give it to my family? Tomorrow you're going back to Hunter's College. Stop playing like a guard with her. Don't you see how nervous she is? Okay, okay, let's eat. Later we discuss. There's nothing like a cold glass of seltzer with dinner. That you learned from your Papa. Hey, sit down. Phil, I'm not hungry. - What's the matter? - She never eats enough. And then she gets nervous all the time. Is that why you were at the doctor's office Thursday? - I wasn't. - Doctor? - Which doctor? - I don't know... some guy named Levit. Levit? The baby doctor? He's crazy. I wasn't at any doctor's office. Louie from the third floor, him and his wife saw you there. Is that true, Rosalie? Mama, please! Tell her. Tell her the truth. Phil, let me alone. I can't take anymore. Now I understand a lot... why she stopped college and... ...other things. You little tramp! All I want to do is to make this girl happy. And she gets herself jammed up like this. - Who's the guy? - Oh, Phil, please. - It won't do any good. - Am I gonna have to slap it out of you? No, Phil, no.. I'll tell you. - But there's nothing you can do... - Whoever he is, I'll make him marry you. Who is it? Nicky Bradna. - Bradna? - The boy who is in prison? In Sing Sing? That no-good, pretty-face punk. You could go for a... for a two-bit crumb like that? Don't make it sound cheap and filthy! He loved me. And I loved him, I still do! Love! He went after every skirt from here to the river. No, no, it wasn't like that. Believe me, Mama. It wasn't, he would have married me, only then he got into this terrible trouble. It ain't only you. What about Mama? How is she going to hold up her head around here? Oh, Mama... Oh, Mama, I'm so ashamed. But you must understand. He would've married me. You've got to understand. I'm so sorry. How long has he got? Oh, Phil, it's no use. How long has he got? It's in the paper. - Where's the paper, Mama? - There. Oh, Mama... He would've married me, I know. He's still got sixty days. Nicky Bradna had sixty days. He didn't know that fate, in the person of Phil Regal, was working an angle. It had all happened so fast it seemed like a nightmare. Just two short months before, Nicky was walking down the avenue. It was a typical Saturday night. Hiya, beautiful. To me you don't have to give that goo. What do you want? Could you trust me for twenty till Monday, Millie? Goodbye, Nicky, it was nice knowing you. - Is Latzi in back? - You look, you'll see. Thank you for the house, gentlemen. - Hey, Latzi. - Nick! - Can I see you a minute? - Yeah. - You want in, Nick? We're filled up today. - No, I'm flat. I wanna ask you... Hey, Latzi, will you close the door? You want the shamus in here? Yeah, yeah, alright. - Yeah, what is it? - Look, what I want to see you about... I got a date with a certain babe tonight... ...and just my luck, I'm flat. Aw, gee, that's too bad, kid. I've been trying to date this babe for weeks. Look, if you let me in for twenty. I'd dip into the box for you and do it, you know I would. But you know who I'm working for, Regal. - You want me to get my head cut off? - Okay, okay, okay, Latzi. Another thing, this date tonight, is it Rosalie, Phil Regal's sister? - No. - 'Cause I hear you've been going with her. Watch your step, will you kid? You know how Phil is. This is somebody else entirely. Okay. I gotta get back in there before they rob me blind. I'm sorry about the dough. I'll see you later, huh? What's so funny? I knew you wouldn't have to spend a nickel. Hey, come on. I gotta buy a bottle. It'll only take a minute. I gotta close up early tonight. My daughter's getting married. Oh, congratulations. I won't keep you. I'd like a fifth of Old Hornet. Do you got any ginger ale on ice? I like it real cold. Yeah, I got it in the icebox. - How many? - A couple, large. All right. Hey, what are you doing? That's my money! Hey, that's my money! That's my money! Help! Police! Help! Help! Stop it! Help! Help, please, help! Help! Help! Somebody, help! Hey, you! Police! Police! I almost hit the guy that did it. - I saw him. - Yeah? No... no... That's it. That's the guy. That's him. Yeah... has he got a record? Just one juvenile offense, car stealing. What do you say, Mr. Cardini? Yes, that's him alright. He was running like the devil. With a knife in his hand. Thank you. With the court's permission, Mr. Cardini, you may leave the stand and walk over to the man... ...whom you saw running from the liquor store after Barricks fell on the sidewalk. Under the powers granted me by the State of New York, I sentence you, Nicholas Bradna, to die in the electric chair... at Sing Sing State Prison, at Ossining, New York... ...some time during the week of November 9th. And may God have mercy on your soul. And may God have mercy on your soul. And may God have mercy on your soul... I think the kid ought to have another chance, Mr. Flanders. From the transcript I'd say he had a fair trial. I ain't denying that, sir, but uh... You can't get away from these two positive identifications. Well now, supposing those witnesses made a mistake? Well, in that case, Mr. Regal, I'd say there was a chance of getting him a new trial. Do you have any indication? Well, I think a couple of those witnesses ain't too sure. Well, uh... if they'd want to come in and give me affidavits to that effect... then I'd say I'd accept the case. Um... here's ten grand. Try that on for size. I think that'll fit fine. But remember, Regal, there mustn't be any intimidation. Oh, nobody's gonna get intimidated, Mr. Flanders. You didn't see him! Tell them the windshield, it was fogged. Please, don't! You been thinking about it and now you just ain't sure it was Bradna, huh? Alright... I'll say it. Please... please don't do it again. I'll say it. It wasn't Bradna! You didn't see him, Cardini. I don't see Bradna? Sure I see him, right over there. You got a nice business here, Cardini. Remember what you used to have before you joined the Protective Association? Remember what happened to Amicci? Please, Mr. Regal... I'm a gonna catch a pneumonia. Here... go and see the lawyer Flanders. Tell him your conscience is bothering you. You don't want the wrong guy to bind. - How's your love life, Millie? - Yeah... Some love life. - Just got out of the hospital. - Yeah, so I heard. - You feeling any better? - I felt better till I seen my bill. Yeah, Millie, uh... Latzi tells me he still got you in the book for a pretty big chunk. Yeah. Three hundred and twelve dollars. I'm doing my best, Mr. Regal. But when you gotta pay a dollar interest... ...for every five you borrow, that's not so easy. Well, maybe I can make it easy on you. Yeah? I'm interested. Nicky Bradna was here just before old man Barricks got knocked off. - Remember? - Yes. He didn't leave here, Millie. He hung around for about an hour clowning with you. So he couldn't have done it, remember? - No. - Oh, sure you do. Well, why didn't I tell it to the D.A. when Nicky was on trial? Well, you had your own troubles. - You was in the hospital. - Yeah, that lousy gall bladder. Now you wanna do what's right. You wanna go see Michael X. Flanders, Nicky's lawyer... ...and give the kid an alibi. An alibi? Oh, yeah... now I remember. - I remember good. - Sure you do. You know how much good your memory's gonna do you? No, Mr. Regal, how much? Three hundred twelve dollars worth. Tell Latzi I said so, hm? Hope I didn't take too long, Ma. Rosalie had a nice talk today with Father Rudanic. Yeah, that's fine. Yes, I told him how ashamed I was... ...and how sorry. I said I really want to have my baby, make a good home for it. I asked him if it was possible for me to marry Nicky in the death house. You ain't marrying nobody in no death house. You want it in the papers I suppose. In the society column, so Mama's friends can read about it. I got news for you, kid. You're marrying that boy in church. I'm getting you a husband to live with. Not to cry over. Oh, Phil you really mean it. Would I kid about a thing like that? But this boy was sent up there for murder. Ah, he got a raw deal, Ma. What chance did he have? With a three hundred-buck lawyer who didn't know his way around third base? You know who I got to handle the deal? Michael X. Flanders. Flanders? He's the biggest lawyer in Brooklyn. Are you kidding? Thirty-six straight acquittals. You think Nicky's innocent. Would I want you to marry him if he wasn't? Now we've got a very good chance. Those two witnesses already changed their testimony. Oh, we found a new witness who was with him when the murder happened. So he... he couldn't have done it. You think he'll get a new trial? With ammunition like that, what do you think? Oh, Phil! I personally took the affidavits of Mr. Cardini and Mr. Hough. And never in my long career as an attorney... ...have I encountered two more conscience-stricken individuals. These men told me that they lay awake night after night... ...worried that their blurred vision, or mistaken identification, would send an innocent young man to his death. Now, these men came to me of their own free will... ...when they heard that I was trying to reopen the case. Now may I further direct your attention to the affidavit of Miss Millie Swadke. She states that at the exact time of the incident at Barricks' liquor store... the defendant was indulging in refreshments at her candy store... ...some four blocks away. And that he engaged her in conversation for some time after the Barricks incident. I've read the affidavit. In view of the preponderance of new evidence, I have no alternative except to grant a new trial. Has the district attorney any comment? A new trial at this time would be a complete waste of the State's funds. Under the present peculiar circumstances, the defendant will be declared innocent. and I would never again be able to try him for this murder... ...which I'm firmly convinced he did commit. Your Honor, I move for immediate dismissal of the charge against my client. Do you agree to dismissal? It's the only way I have to keep the charge open. I agree. In the hope that some day I may be able to again charge this defendant... ...and make it stick. Mr. Flanders, the district attorney has taken the only way open to him. But these circumstances are extraordinary, and suggest an improper, probably illegal and certainly imoral situation. Case dismissed. Believe me, Flanders, sooner or later I'll get those witnesses for perjury. It's your privilege, Blaker. First you'll have to prove it. What... what happened? What's the decision? Do I get a new trial? No new trial. You're free as of now. Free. Wow. Mr. Flanders, you did it! - You did it, you did it! - Easy, Bradna, control yourself. How can I ever thank you, Mr. Flanders? I've been well paid. You can thank the man who retained me. Well, I've been asking you, who is it? You'll know in a minute. Okay, he's all yours. Hello, punk. Phil Regal. You... You were the one who... You hired Flanders for me. How... how do you thank somebody for a thing like this... for saving my life? I didn't do it because I like you. Then I... I don't get it. For Rosalie. My kid sister, that's who I did it for. I guess you know who Rosalie is. Rosalie, of course I know her. She's in love with you, punk. She's gonna have your kid. That's why you're out and alive. For one reason and one reason only, to make her happy. She's... I didn't know, I... Being up there and all, I didn't know. Yeah, sure. If you had known, you would have done something about it, huh? If I could... I swear, Mr. Regal, I would have been on the level with her. You will be. She's waiting at home for you. So all the time it was Rosalie. Come on, punk, you're getting married tomorrow. You should see the arrangements I made. Hermie, hey, Hermie! Wait for me! Hey, hello, Lucille. You were invited, huh? What else, I'm going without an invitation? I can't get over it. The day before yesterday he's at Sing Sing and today he gets married. Excuse me. Hey, hey, hey, sweeties. Hey, sweetie, ain't you overdoing it a little? Oh, yeah. Come on, honey, let's sit down and relax. - Oh, you both are out of your mind. - Come on, take it easy. - Nice party, huh? - Oh, Phil, I owe you so much. We sure do. You go sit down. I'll get you some punch. Okay. - Nicky... - Be with you in a minute. I wanna get some of that food. - Here Rosalie, sit by your mama. - Oh, thank you. Rosie! Your eyes should shine like this every day. Oh, Mama, the way everything worked out. I couldn't be happier. I hope the boy after today will be better than before. I think now with the responsibilities and someone to really care for him... he'll be different, I know. I hope so, Rosalie. I pray so. Nicky boy, you must have a rabbit's foot or something. I got the whole bunny. What job do you think Phil's planning for you? I don't know. Bookmaking, maybe. Remember I used to be a runner for Joe Bellassini, I'm very good at organizing, you know. - Hey, Finnie, do me a favor, will you? - Sure, Mr. Regal. - Tend Miss Rosalie there. - Sure, glad to. What'll you have, Phil? I want to talk to you. Come here. You're the luckiest punk in the world, you know that? When the number's up it's very few people who get handed a brass ring. You don't have to tell me, Phil. If I thank you a million times, it won't express how grateful I am. Gratitude you can stick up your nose. There's only one reason I got you a free ride. You don't have to be sore at me, I'll... I'm going to do everything I can to try and make it up to her, I'm crazy about her. And see that you stay that way. I heard you talking to Finney in there. I guess you have got something in mind for me to do. Yeah, I got something in mind. You're starting for the Celeno brothers Monday. - Celeno, the... - Driving a truck, $85 a week. $85... Kids cost plenty, and Rosalie, she... If Rosalie needs something she knows where to come. All you gotta worry about is keeping your nose clean and staying out of jams. You're making an honest living for you, understand? I understand. I just thought for your brother-in-law you'd have special plans. I ain't complaining. Okay, okay, stop looking like the world fell on you. This is your wedding. Let's go and drink to Rosalie's happiness. Come on, everybody, we're gonna drink a toast to the bride and groom. Hey, Rosalie. Here. And so, Nicky and Rosalie were married. And, as far as Phil was concerned, they would live happily ever after. Or else. One day, a few weeks later, a strange form of marine life... ...popped to the surface of a catskill mountain lake. The body was identified as Albert Paradise... ...until recently, supervisor of slot machines in the catskill district. Attached to his remains was one of his own slot machines. I hideously humorous warning on the part of the executioners. It was never proved that Phil Regal had anything to do with this grim joke. However, shortly thereafter, one of his men arrived in that the district to take over the slot machine business. Because of the Paradise killing, I was assigned to do a series of articles... ...tying together all of the unsolved gang murders in greater New York. I was interviewing every known racket executive. What do you have to do to get a mink coat like that? I haven't got it yet. Hey, that kiss just cost me four thousand bucks. You know, one thing I like about you, kid. You got a lot of guts coming up here to interview me... ..when you probably writing a bummer or something. It's my job, Regal. Sure you can write all that old junk about how I'm mixed up in a lot of rackets, but what would you have? - I'd like a fresh angle. - Alright. You wanna write an article about Phil Regal? Write about, um... "Phil Regal and his Family". Might make a story at that. Regal felt that anything I'd write about his racket activities... ...would be last year's hash. He insisted that I get a new outlook on the Regal story... if I'd go to dinner with him at his mother's home in Brooklyn. How do you like my Ma? She's kinda cute, ain't she? - Oh, Phil. - She's very nice. Ah... A guy like you wouldn't know what it means to come out of a crummy section this... ...and still be a success. You might be wrong about that. - Ah, what college did you go to? - Columbia. Yeah? Come here. That was my college down there. There used to be an old man with a pushcart of fruit. Every day on the way home from school we pulled a trick I figured out. One of the kids would grab an apple or something so the old man would chase him. Then the rest of us would fill out buckets. When the old geezer'd come back, half the fruit stand would be missing. Afterwards I'd charge the guy a dime a day to keep the other kids from stealing. How do you like that? A dime a day for protection. Hello, Phil. Those stairs get higher every time I climb them. There she is! Hiya, dollface. Uh... this is Joe McFarland of the Chronicle. This is my sister Rosalie. Oh, I know Joe. We went to high school together. Rosalie Regalzyk. Phil Regal, Regalzyk. That's funny, I never got the connection. - You went to high school together? - Yes. Of course he was a couple of years ahead of me. She wouldn't remember this, but one whole term I had an awful crush on her. You never said anything. You, um... you used to live around here? Just six blocks away. My father walked a beat on Roebling Street. A cop? McFarland... Gimpy McFarland, he kinda limped. He was shot in the leg when he first joined the Force. Say, he was killed, wasn't he? I kinda remember. Yeah... By a couple of other kids who... ...went to college in that street down there. Joe, what ever happened to you? You just disappeared. Mother and I moved to Manhattan, I got a scholarship... ...and went to Columbia, journalism. - What are you, a wise guy or something? - Hm? Letting me shoot off my mouth about how you wouldn't understand... ...living a section like this and not say nothing? Well, we were getting your story, not mine. You know I kinda like this guy? Dinner is ready, Phil. - Hello, Rosalie. - Hello, Mama! Come on, let's go and eat. Get a load of that. Still the prettiest kid in the neighborhood. I'll bet she is. Hi, everybody, what's stewing? You're late. I'm a working stiff, remember? Had to take a load over to Jersey. Sunday's double time. - How are you, honey? - Fine. Joe, this is my husband, Nicky Bradna. - Joe McFarland. - Hi. Joe and I used to go to school together. That so? What's to eat, Ma? Well, I wish I could stay longer... ...but I've got a deadline, I hope you'll excuse me. - I'll drive you back. - No, no, I'll get a cab... Aw, cut it out, I've got to go to Manhattan anyway. I've got some people waiting. Mama... Mrs. Regalzyk, thanks for a wonderful meal. Anytime, you are welcome. - Come back, come with Phil. - Thank you. - It was nice seeing you again. - Same here. And knowing you had a crush on me. Oh, Joe, wait for me in the car. I'll be down in a minute. Yeah... So long. How are things with the truck, Nicky? All right. Pretty rugged for what I get out of it. You're doing okay. Just keep your nose clean. Why do you have everybody at the plant watching me? You're loony. I know you got that red-headed bookkeeper on the payroll. I trip over him every time I go to the washroom. - So don't go to the washroom. - Phil, let them live their own lives. When will you learn? I know this punk better than you do, Ma. How are you feeling, Rosalie? - What does the doctor say? - I'm fine. You'd think you were going to have the baby. I got a big stake in this kid. I'm gonna be an uncle. Wait, Phil. I go down with you. I have some dinner for Miss Walters. She don't feel so good. I ain't gonna stand for it. I just can't take it anymore. Honey, he doesn't mean anything. Keep your nose clean. Tow the mark. Watch yourself. He's picking at me. Picking like I was a piece of dirt. Him and his big cars, them two-hundred-dollar suits. Look at me. Look at the rags I gotta wear. I get up 6 o'clock in the morning slaving a crummy truck all day. - I ain't used to that and he knows it. - Nicky. He's got a great big charge out of doing these things to me. If he'd raise one little finger he could put me up to something good. - With all the rackets he's running... - Nicky! Are you kidding yourself? Everybody and his brother knows that he's an enforcer for gambling, shylocking... Don't you dare talk like that about Phil after all he's done for you. I'm sorry. I don't ever want to hear you say anything like that again. Oh, honey. Don't let Phil get under your skin. This is only his way. He's doing what he thinks is best for you. So why does he pick on me? Don't pay any attention to him. I think you're doing fine. What do we care what Phil does or says? As long as we love each other... ...we'll make a good life for ourselves, you'll see. You know something, Rosalie? You're an awful good kid. Come on, your dinner's getting cold. For some time after that, Nicky really tried to tow the mark, keep his nose clean. Rosalie! Where are you, honey? What's all the noise? What have you got? A whole ham and two bottles of that sherry you like. What's the celebration? Kiss me, baby, and you'll be kissing a ninety-five-buck-a-week man. You got a raise. Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. Sure, they like me. Celeno brothers. They say if I keep it up I could even get to be fleet manager someday. Oh, I'm gonna call Mama right now and tell her. And be sure and tell it to that brother of yours, too. - He thinks I can't do anything good. - Don't worry, I'll tell him myself. Hey, you're pretty rough on a girl in my condition. Gee, I'm sorry, I... I was only joking. I hope he has your eyes. And life looked very bright for Nicky and Rosalie. Especially the night she went to the hospital to have her baby. If I knew I'd have to wait around all afternoon, I could have worked my shift. Does it always take this long, Ma? Sometimes it takes longer than other times. Hey, Ma, tomorrow you and me gotta go shopping... ...and buy a bunch of toys for that kid. Alright, alright... - Mr. Bradna? - Yeah. - Are you Mr. Bradna? - No, 'I'm Mr. Bradna. I'm the baby's uncle. What is it, a boy or a girl? Come with me, please. - Please... - Well, what is it? Something happened to Rosalie? No, she's not in danger. The baby. Strangulated cord. - He died. - Oh, my poor Rosalie. Hey, Doc, can I see my wife? Only her mother now, please. You can see her in the morning. I'm sorry. Come with me. You lousy crumb. Phil, wait a minute. You act like it was my fault. How is it my fault, tell me, how? Don't talk to me! Don't you treat me like this, like I'm guilty of something! I've had enough of you, you stinking nothing. I was hoping one good thing would come of all this. With you it couldn't happen. If you know what's good for you, stay away from me. Just stay away from me. This was the breaking point. Nicky was through. He would take no more shoving around. To Nicky, independence meant just two things. Women and money. For the first he made certain cozy arrangements... ...with a bar waitress named Margie. For the second, he arranged to have his own truck hijacked by his good friend Shimmy. To make it look good, he didn't let his helper Ollie in on the hijack plans. Hey, what's with those guys? They're shoving us off the road. - It's a stickup - Get down, you guys. Come on, come on! Now come on! Hey, you can't get away with this, hijacking... Shut up! Tie me up and get the load out of here. Come on, tie him up. Phil Regal... Big man. Hey! Give. - Oh, it'll spot the rug. - Who cares? In a couple of weeks we'll be getting out of here. I told you... I wanna have a stake at ten grand, huh? Oh, yeah. I already got six and a half thou. A couple more deals and away we go. Darling, if you're doing so good here. That's piker stuff. It's to get a stake. I told you my plans. With what I know about the rackets here, out in California it ain't gonna take no time at all. I'll be big, real big. And maybe I'll come back here and... ...show a few guys who's boss. A few days after Nicky's declaration of independence, assistant district attorney Blaker sent for me. I'm asking you to help. How? Run the toughest story on Regal you can write. List every crime we've ever accused him of, Name all his assistant rights, every name you can dig up. - How will that help? - You might just scare one of them. You know, Joe, we can talk about being brilliant prosecutors from now till doomsday. But the truth is there's only one way that organized crime can be cracked. Get somebody on the inside to talk. Your story might just scare one of them enough to do it. I know it's hard to take, Rosalie. I've been putting off running the story because I knew it would hurt you. But I can't put it off any longer. I'm not gonna read any more of this. I don't believe a word of it. It's all true. You don't know Phil very well. You don't know half the good things he does. You don't know what he's done for me and Nicky. Look, that's the side of it you want to see. Sooner or later you're going to have to face up to the other side. I said I don't want to hear any more. - Rosalie... - Why did you come here in the first place? Maybe I shouldn't have. But one day the roof is going to cave in on Phil and I... When it happens, I don't want you to be standing next to him. Goodbye, Rosalie. - Hiya, sweetie baby. - Rosalie! - Well, uh... how's everything? - Fine, fine. - What have you got? - Ah, the freshest lobsters you'll ever eat. Right smack out of the Chesapeake Bay. I'll take them to the ice box. Hey, the place looks nice. Thank you. Where's Nicky? Oh, he's working. He's on a night run. Is that so? Funny he should go on a run without his license. Oh, he went out so quickly tonight he must have forgotten it. Nicky hates to wear his cap. Well, I just came over to bring you the lobsters. So long, Ma. If you need anything, give me a ring, huh? Sure, fine. Phil, wait! Phil, it's no use lying to you. Nicky isn't on a run. I don't know where he is. He's... he's kind of mixed up lately. It's because of the baby and everything, you know. It affected both of us. He's awful restless, Phil. But he'll settle down. Give him a chance, huh? Sure, sure, sweetie. Don't worry. See you soon, huh? So, for quite a while, Nicky did alright for himself. Oh! Why does a dame always carry all this junk? If you were a girl, you'd know. Did you lose something? Phil. Hello, I... I heard you were out of town. I got back. - Phil, I wanna tell you something. - Some other time, kid. Phil, it'll just take a minute, I... What's the matter? Who was that? Oh, just a guy I know. You better go in, I'll see you later. Come on. No, go on, beat it. Hiya, Ma. Is dinner ready? In a few minutes. The sun is nice and warm yet. Yeah. Remember the fun I used to have up here when I was a kid? We used to play cops and robbers. I had the whole gang buffered, remember, Ma? I used to jump across the next roof there... ...run down the cellar of that house and just disappear on them. - Disappear? - Yeah, the kids never found out. There's a way out that cellar you don't have to come up for blocks. Fun he calls it. Every time I heard he jumped my heart would stop. What is it, a whole eight feet? I bet I can still do it. You wanna see me do it now? - Don't try it, Phil. - He still thinks he's a kid. You are now twenty years older... ...and fifty pounds heavier. - So what? - Alright, you can do it on one foot. Come down in five minutes. Hey, you got plenty of seltzer? This time I remembered. How did you get the bruise on your chin, Rosie? I told you. Yes... you slipped and hit it on the sink. How did you get it? What are you trying to do, Phil? That punk's giving you a hard time, ain't he? Leave me alone. Look, I happen to know a couple of things you don't know. You didn't get that bruise from no sink, did you? Did you? Honey, you don't love this guy anymore. Come on, now, admit it. I don't know. Half the time I don't even know where he is or who he's running around with. I made a mistake! So what do I do now, jump off the roof? Yeah... Yeah... no, wait a minute, Charlie. Better have another talk with Gardelli. Jamaica fell way down this month. Yeah... alright. Call me back. Hiya, kid. Phil, I... I wanna explain to you about last night. What about it? I guess it kinda looked funny to you. What do you mean, uh... funny? Well... you see, this girl's brother, he's a pal of mine and... And we were shooting pool and... ...and a guy hit him with a cue. Pretty bad. So I went to get his sister to take him home. She, uh... she works in that bar. So what's there to explain? I didn't want you to get the wrong idea. Don't be a shmaltz. - How's Rosalie? - She's fine. Good. Well... I guess I'll blow. Yeah... hold it! Give Rosalie my love. Tell her I'll see her Sunday, uh? Sure. But Phil, I can't do it. Not to Nicky. He's my best friend. That's why the frame will work. He trusts you guys. - But Phil, you can't ask me to... - Punk, to me you don't say no! Either you gonna do like I told you or you'll be the dead pigeon... ...instead of Harry Goldish, you understand? Sure, sure, Mr. Regal, we understand. Alright. So rehearse me the setup. I don't want no mistakes. You want us to get Harry Goldish into the poker game with Nicky. Yeah. And we don't let Nicky leave till at least an hour after Harry does. That's right. And I'll need two other guys in the game. Get Bloomy and Angel, I already talked to them. Yeah. Look, Latzi boy, if you wanna be a big man in this business, you gotta forget personalities. I got a score to settle with this double-crossing jewelry fence Harry Goldish. And I want to take care of my cute brother-in-law at the same time. No personalities, just business. And so, believing that Phil had swallowed his lie about Margie, Nicky went to his regular Saturday night poker game in Millie's back room. But this time there was an added feature. The jewelry fence, Harry Goldish. Twenty and... twenty more. You're good to see me, Harry? Not for me. Don't forget the house. You didn't even have a pair. You bluffed me! You could have called me, Harry. I oughta shove these cards right down your throat. Hey, what time is it? It's almost twelve o'clock. I got a date at twelve. I'm leaving. Yeah, the winner's always got a date. Why don't you call her, Nick, huh? Yeah, Nick, you don't want to quit when you're doing so good. Call her. Okay, I'll be right back. His pals convinced Nicky he ought to stay. Nicky was on the hook. Now to put Harry on the road. They broke him fast by a little phony dealing. What's the matter, Harry boy? No luck, huh? That cleaned me up for good. Too bad, Harry. It's not your night. Hey, Nicky, with all that loot, you oughta buy your babe a rock. Buy this ring for six hundred. I can stay in the game with you. Four fifty. You don't wanna buy it Nicky. Suppose it's hot. Yeah, what do you wanna do? Get Nicky in trouble? Aw, you crumbs, it's skin off your nose if somebody wants to make a buck? These are my friends, Harry. - They're just trying to protect me. - Ah, who cares? I got a guy that's gonna take all the schmear off my hands in the morning. See you guys. So long, Harry. - No hard feelings, Harry. - Take it easy, Harry. - Well, I gotta leave too. - Where are you going... Look, give us a chance to get our money back. Yeah, stick around, Nick, this is your night. Yeah... okay. Okay. When Phil Regal organized a frame, he organized. First, he took care of Harry Goldish. Done. Next in order, Nicky Bradna. Thanks for the contribution, guys, but I gotta go, it's after two. Good thing you quit, or you'd have busted all of us. So long, Latzi, I'll see you. Lucky Nicky. Nicky was confused. Where was Margie? Phil had taken care of that too. No loose ends. Phil liked things neat. - Hey! - Hey, what is this? A stickup? You got the wrong pigeon. I'm Phil Regal's brother-in-law. - You Nicky Bradna? - Yeah. Let's go. This is an arrest. I ain't done nothing. You're making a mistake. We'll apologize later. Phil's frame was perfect. A tip to the cops that the killer looked like Nicky... Harry Goldish's bag of diamonds planted in Nicky's suit... ...hanging in Margie's closet. The gun that killed Harry was planted there too. Nicky was held for Harry's murder. But he wasn't worried. He had an alibi. Four alibis, in fact. Named Bloomy, Angel, Shimmy and Latzi. I wanna talk to my lawyer, I know my rights. Talk to your lawyer. Phone? Phone book. Want me to dial it for you, sweetheart? Hello? I want to talk to Mr. Flanders. What? In Europe? No, never mind, I'll find somebody else. It's about time you showed, Callan, it's after seven. - Mr. Callan to you, you cheap liar! - What's the matter with you? All I want from you guys is the truth and then maybe I can do something for you. But when you deliberately lie to your own lawyer... ...there's nothing I can or will do for you. I don't get it, who lied? What are you talking about? You, you gave me your alibi. Four lifelong friends you played poker with. Well, I questioned each one of them at a different time... ...and at a different place, and they all gave me exactly the same story. - What did they say? - That you left the game at about 12:18... ...just three minutes after Harry. Do you want me to go into court with that kind of an alibi? Latzi too? Those dirty lousy liars. Believe me, Mr. Callan... - They're framing me. - Why would they want to frame you? Phil Regal. That's it. He wants to get rid of me. Phil Regal's framing me. He got to all those guys and you gotta help me prove it. Officer. You'd better get yourself another lawyer. He framed me. He framed me. They read about the trial. Just thirteen months from the time he had been released... ...from the death house at Sing Sing, Nicky was again convicted for murder in the first degree. He framed me! I swear, Phil Regal framed me! Phil Regal he framed me! Phil Regal he framed me! I swear, Phil Regal framed me! Phil Regal he framed me! Hey, reporters, out of the way! Rosalie, out this way. Thanks for getting me out of there. Isn't there some way I can help you? No, thanks. Look, I want to ask you a question. Nicky still claims that Phil framed him. Do you think that's possible? Why should Phil frame him? The last time Nicky was convicted he got him out. Hm-hmm. I guess you're angry with me for my stories about Phil. Joe, right now I don't feel anything. Can I drop by and see you sometime? Three days before the date set for Nicky's execution, I received a telegram from Sing Sing. Phil received one too. Hello, Phil. Hiya, kid. What's this junk about you giving me a last chance? You came. Why, you scared? Are you kidding? Just a... free house day, that's all. I'm supposed to go to the chair on Thursday, Phil. If you'd let one of your boys that sat in on that poker game tell the truth, I could get a stay and a new trial. My boys? If you don't, I'm gonna get you. Maybe I'll die, but I'm gonna get you. Yeah? How? I didn't kill Harry Goldish, and I can't prove you did. But I did kill Barricks. And if you don't do what I said, I'm gonna give Joe McFarland the whole Barricks story. How you got me out. They'll put you away, Phil. It's up to you. If it's up to me, you're gonna burn. You got no beef. I wanted to make my sister happy. So I got you a free ride on the merry-go-round. I gave you a brass ring. You messed things up... ...so I'm taking it back. It's fair. Fair enough? Guard! I wanna see Joe McFarland. You can't take any pictures in there. Hm? Oh, well, this isn't a camera. It's a midget tape-recorder. A new gadget I use for interviews. See? All I do is push this switch and I can record anything you say. Where is the microphone? Right here under my tie. How about that! What are you doing here? I got an invitation. I've been reading your stuff. One of these days I'm gonna lose my patience. Mr. McFarland. You print one word that punk tells you... you'll be picking it up in a basket. - Hello, Nicky. - Thanks for coming, Mr. McFarland. Your wife said something about a story. Yeah, I got a story for you. A big story. But first you gotta promise to help me. If there's any way I can. Well... I'll try to make sense. What I want you to do is to make a deal for me with the D.A. How? On what grounds? He's been trying to get something on Phil Regal for years. So he can put him away. Am I right? Yes. Well, this is it. I'll give him the facts on the Barricks case that he never had. Then he'll have to believe me, he'll have to. Why, Nicky? Because I really killed Barricks. You mean you want to confess that to the D.A.? It's my last chance to save my life. Then he'll have to believe me, won't he? I'll testify how Phil got me out. By strong-arming those witnesses, see? If I can help him get Phil, then maybe you can make a deal so I can get off for second-degree. Do you want me to print that, Nicky? That you confessed the Barricks murder? You do anything, anything you have to. I only have two days left. Alright, Nicky. I'll do everything I can. I accuse Phil Regal. Tomorrow, Nicky Bradna may die in the electric chair. Tonight, your reporter was beaten to a pulp. I accuse Phil Regal... of being responsible for... ...both incidents. What are you doing here? I thought I told you to tail McFarland. You want me to tail him to Sing Sing? - Don't be funny. - Well, that's where he went. From his apartment he walked to his office. Stayed there a couple of hours. Then he walked to the D.A.'s office. - The D.A.'s office, huh? - Stayed there maybe half an hour. Then I followed him to Grand Central. He bought a ticket for Sing Sing. He went to see the punk. - How about tomorrow? - Yeah, better tail him tomorrow. After we'll see. What did he say? Why? He must have had a reason. What did he say? I went over the whole Barricks file with the D.A. He kept after Cardini and Hough for six months. But he couldn't get them to admit they'd been scared into changing their testimony. In order to get them to talk he'd have had to use more brutal methods than Phil. And of course he couldn't do that. So... So I guess this is it. I don't know what else to do, Nicky. Phil Regal. What he must have done to Latzi to get him to frame me. Latzi Franks, my best friend. I grew up with him, we went on our first date together, we... What he must have done to Latzi. If you see him, you tell him I don't hold no grudge. I guess this is it. We just couldn't wait to grow up. But some place something went wrong. Maybe I had it coming to me. I'm sorry, Nicky. So long. At that moment, when it was too late, Nicky realized that life might have been very different... ...if he had decided to live it differently. Just another victim of the slum, the gang and himself. The night that Nicky died... I was oppressed by a vague feeling of guilt. Deep inside I knew I was in love with Nicky's widow. But that wasn't it. It was something I should have done and... ...hadn't thought of doing. "Phil Regal. What he must have done to Latzi to get him to frame me. Latzi Franks, my best friend. I grew up with him, we went on our first date together, we..." You were the last one he talked about, Latzi. Said you were his best friend. Yeah, so? Said he understood why you were forced to... I got no secrets from her. We're engaged to be married. In that case, I'll let you hear exactly what he said. "Phil Regal! What he must have done to Latzi to get him to frame me." It's Nicky. "Latzi Franks, my best friend. I grew up with him, we went on our first date together, we..." Look, mister, Nicky was a good kid. But he was wrong. Nobody framed him. Sure they did, Latzi, and you can prove it. For Nicky. He was your best friend. I'll make a deal with the D.A. If you admit the frame, I'll try to get you off with a light rap. Are you kidding? Get out of here! The D.A. doesn't want you, Latzi, he wants Phil Regal. Alright, Phil made you do it, you can get back at him this way. For Nicky. You're asking for it, mister, now beat it. Alright. If you change your mind, you can reach me at the Chronicle. How do you like that for gall? This is our chance, Latzi. To get out of the rackets like we've been talking about. Evelyn, how many times have I told you? This fellow will help you with the D.A. He ain't scared of Phil. Look, even after they beat him up he wrote about him. Do you know what you're asking me to do? I'm asking you to be a man. You know what happened to Lefty, to Al Paradise? The police will give you protection. Either you talk to Mr. McFarland or we're finished. I'm not gonna wind up a gangster's widow. I can't do it. Alright, so we're through. The next time you see me on the street, don't talk to me. 'Cause I just won't know you. Goodbye, Latzi. Evelyn, wait! McFarland. Hm-hmm. Latzi? Yeah, fine, fine. Uh-huh. Alright, I'll be in a gray convertible, half-way down the block on the North side. Yeah, good, 11 o'clock tonight. Alright. Oh, it's you. - I'm just going out. - Mrs. Regalzyk, is Rosalie here? You can write about my son like you do and then come here looking for Rosalie? Mrs. Regalzyk, it's urgent that I talk to her, it concerns you too. If it concerns me, Rosalie will tell me. She's up on the roof. Tell her I'm going to the grocer's. Rosalie. Hello, Joe. You know Latzi Franks? He's in Bellevue Hospital. Phil's mob tried to kill him. He spilled everything he knew about Phil. Nobody's guessing anymore, the D.A. has the whole story. How Phil killed Harry Goldish just to frame Nicky. You didn't believe me before, but this time you have to. So what is it, what do you want me to do? This is going to be a dirty rotten mess. Clear out before it happens. You expect me to turn my back on my entire life... ...in three seconds because you tell me it's right? - Because you have to. - Well, who knows what's right? - Rosalie, you're still... Look, you came here to tell me that my brother is a murderer... ...and you expect me to pat you on the back, is that what you want? No! I want you to break with him. Look, you got yourself a big story. Now get out! Get out and leave me alone! This is Joe McFarland, I want to talk to the D.A. Anything new on Regal, Mr. Blaker? Oh, you have a warrant out. Uh-huh. Yeah, well, if he's not at his place, he'll probably be at his mother's. Yes, he does, every Sunday. Alright, I'll keep in touch. Hey, Mama! Rosalie, I'm here. Hey, sweetie, didn't you hear me? Hello, Phil. How's my baby, uh? - Stop it, Phil, you need a shave. - I shaved this morning. Where's Ma? I guess she went to Millie's. We were out of seltzer. Honey, I know how you feel. In a few days you'll forget the whole thing. He was no good, Rosie. Sure... in a few days I'll forget. Hey, you know what? You need a change. I'm gonna send you and Mama to Miami for the winter. That'll fix everything. Good old Phil. Away to the pocketbook and he fixes everything. What's the matter with you? For the first time in my life I'm seeing things as they really are. Say, you're nuts or something, what... Alright, Phil, I'll make things plain. - You took care of me all these years. - Yeah. - You sent me to college. - Sure I did. - You bought me a car. - Yeah. And you got Nicky out of the death house so he could marry me. So what are you sore about? Then because he was no good you killed a guy so you could frame him for me. Now, wait a minute, Rosie, it wasn't like that... It's no use lying anymore, Phil. I know. I know everything you've done. Alright, suppose you do. - Who did I do it for, me? - No, me. You fixed it so that I'd marry a murderer. Live with a murderer, sleep with a murderer! You got yourself jammed up. I wanted you to marry a nice, decent guy. You had to fall for... for a punk like that. I know I'm to blame. But do you think I would have married Nicky if you hadn't convinced me he was innocent? Rosie, everything I did was to make you happy. How? By force? By killing? You wanted me to marry some decent guy. Where was I supposed to meet such a guy? Who was I? From the time you first stole off a pushcart my life was over. There was no more Rosalie Regalzyk. Only Phil Regal's sister. How can you talk to me like that? You... you talk like you hate me. Honey, I'll do anything for you. You've done enough for me! Now leave me alone! Rosalie, you've got to get out of here before Phil... The police are coming here for Phil. I don't want you to get hurt. Why would she get hurt? Phil, you've got to get out of here before the police comes. Save yourself. - What have they got on me? - Rosalie! Latzi told them everything, you haven't got a chance. Save yourself. That's my sister. Don't worry, nobody's gonna get me. I'm way ahead of them. All I gotta do is get out of this neighborhood and spread a little grease. The combine will fix this rap. Phil. A couple of police cars just pulled up. Rosie, tell them I'll be back soon. - Not to worry. - What are you going to do? I'm gonna pull a disappearing act that'll have them talking to themselves. The police will be on their way up the stairs, Phil. If you really love your sister, why don't you give yourself up peacefully? Get away from that door! You're gonna use the gun, you want Rosalie to see you for what you really are? I should have done this a long time ago. Phil, don't! On the roof. Give up, Regal. You haven't got a chance. That's the way all these guys end up. A corpse in the alley. Cry, Rosalie. Go ahead and cry. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
