Incoming call on your phone. Please answer it now. Thank you. Hello. I just received your message. Got cancelled again? Will it even push through? I already filed a vacation leave. Sis, maybe next year? We just need to save up. You know, I don't even see Nobu these days. He's so busy. You've been engaged for two years. Being engaged for two years isn't so bad. You're overreacting, sis, I'm the one getting married. Well, that's your life. But I'll just cancel my leave, okay? Fine. Thanks for the call. I need to go. I'm running late. Okay, bye. Okay. Bye, I love you. What's wrong? Please grow, you're not a bonsai. Why don't you blossom? The sun's here, so don't be lazy, or I'll replace you with a guava tree. Bye. Please look after the house for me. Bye. Good morning, everyone! My name is Lea. Thank you very much. Welcome to the Sapporo Clock Tower. It is the oldest building in the city. It is the symbol of Sapporo. And this is our symbol. 35 years ago, you said "Yes" to me here. And time stopped for us ever since. You're still the most beautiful flower among all the flowers. Up to now, you're still handsome and naughty. Want to go to the clock tower? Can I turn back the time? I can't stop time then. Then what's exciting about going there? I have a request. Will you marry me? Because I love you. I love you. I love you, baby. Bad luck Good luck! Good day. My name is Lea. I try to be my own life's tour guide. At times, nothing seems beautiful. But there are small things that will make you smile. And you just have to trust that little surprises will come. It's fine. Let's forget it. Take care. Aiko. How are you? I'm good. Let's have lunch? No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I'm just tired. Let's have a drink. Maybe next time. Sorry, I have plans for tonight. I'm your friend. Fellow Filipinos should look after each other. See you. Take care. See you. Good morning. This letter is for you. Thank you. Let's meet at the beer garden at 8:00 p.m. Hello, sis. How are you? I just want to ask if you've cancelled your vacation leave. You might not have to. Nobu just surprised me with a letter saying he'd be here at the Beer Garden. Now, he's asking me to stop calling him. I think he might surprise me with another proposal. An all-out production number this time. No, I'm not gushing. I'm not. I'm sorry, I just had four mugs of beer. All I wanted to say was don't cancel your leave, the wedding might push through. And bye for now, I need to retouch my makeup. Okay, bye-bye. I wanted to scream, weep, curse, kill, kill myself. Calm down. Calm down before making a decision. Count from one to ten before you even do anything, so there'd be no regrets in the end. One... You asshole! What a shameless prick! I'll pour acid on your face so you'll have no face to show. Jerk. You were busy? You mean, busy flirting. You're sluttier than a whore. I'll cut your dear manhood, just so your cold heart will feel something! Two... What a slut. Hey! So a fellow Filipino just betrayed me. Even if you're a half-breed, you're still Filipino. I even taught you how to speak Tagalog! You betray me in every way. I will kill you! You see, I can curse you and kill you in any language. I will scoop out your contact lens along with your eyes. I'll cook a stew out of it and feed it to the dogs. You're an ass! Except you stink even more! You're a stray cat that steals! Three. What's wrong with you? You want a threesome? You fooled me. How long have you been fooling me? Four. You had four years to break up with me. Why did it have to be like this? Where did I go wrong, Nobu? Why did you wait five years? Five. Five years since we first met. Strong drink, please. Your costume is nice. You look good in it. Thank you very much. The heart should be somewhere else, where the fun is. It shouldn't be alone. I just came from a party, all the hearts had a pair. It's more fun to be alone. Here you go. You're cute. You're cute, too. Yes, you're cute. Six. You have six moles on your body. Two on your neck. One on the face. Two more on your hand. And another on your private part. Until nothing was private because I got to know everything. Every little thing. Seven. I had seven cups of sake. And with that last shot... ...my life changed. Eight. Eight times, I stopped myself from peeing that night. I don't know why I chose for my bladder to suffer over you losing sight of me. Should we ring the bell of Happiness? Nine. Striking that bell nine times, I told myself, "This is it! This is really it!" The blood clot in my heart's gone. There's no more clog. Now, the blood can flow again. So it's gonna be bloody. Ten. I called you ten times. You wouldn't pick up. It's our anniversary. Did you just forget or have you forgotten? I did not change. I'm still wearing my heart. And you? Where did you hide yours? You want something to drink? Come here, it's my treat. That night, my life was in the hands of a banana. And that night, I was the only one. I was the only heart with a banana. One. Two. Three. Four, five, six. Seven, eight, nine. Ten. This is the last strike. Lea, let's talk. Lea. Wait. Sorry, Lea. Lea, sorry. Lea, I prepared food for you in the refrigerator. The ones on top for the first week. At the bottom for the second week. They're ready to heat in the microwave oven. I placed markers on the microwave oven. I also fixed your room. You'll always bring your phone with you, okay? Good day! Nice to meet you. I am Philippine... Filipino man. Pardon my Japanese, I'm not fluent. So you can speak Tagalog. Why did you have to speak in English and Japanese? My countryman! I'm sorry. I'm just learning to speak Japanese. I also just moved here across from your house. It's nice here. Cool and breezy. On that street, there's a convenience store, it's 24 hours. I think people like it, a store a stone's throw away. And you know... My countryman! Want some of the spicy pork that I cooked? Good morning. My countryman! I'm sorry. Forgive me, I'm sorry. Countryman, hold on. Just a moment. Countryman, I'm sorry, okay? Countryman... I brought you some fried noodles. Are you there? Stop bothering me. I don't want to see you. I mean, I don't want to hear anything from you. Hey! Are you hiding from me? Yes? Are you talking to me? Is there any problem? No, I'm very sorry. Good morning. Hey! Stop bothering me. Do you plan to steal from me? I'm no thief. Actually I just wanted to hang out. I wanted to talk to you. You know what, you're mean. So did you think I'm a robber because I'm Filipino? I just wanted to hang out because I don't know anyone. Then find some friends. I don't need any, so stop bothering me. Just a second. Talk to me. Countryman! Countryman, just a moment. I have fried banana rolls. They're sweet. Maybe you need some sugar for that sour look in your face. Countryman! Good morning, countryman! Rooster's crow! Wake up! Rooster's crow! What now? I cooked a lot of beef stew so you could have some. Don't worry, these aren't leftovers. Let me tell you, beef stew is my specialty. Let me just take the container I left yesterday. It's definitely spoiled. Just take it. You put it there, you take it away. Just asking permission. You might mistake me as a thief again. Why do you keep coming here? Don't you get it? I'm not interested in your cooking. Are you stupid? Don't you have a friend? Look for someone else you can talk to. Just feed the pigs with your leftovers! Stop wasting your time talking to a blind girl! How are you, plants? Still wanna live? You're turning into zombies. Turn into what? Not saying it again. Who's there? Countryman! I watered your plants since they're turning into zombies... I mean, they're giving up on life. Did I ask you to water them? No, I did it without being asked. I was just going to take my container. It's from my grandma. You know, I'm really stupid. I don't actually cook. I just want to have friends around here. Don't worry, I won't trouble you anymore. Thank you for all the time you wasted on me. I'll get going, Countryman. Hold on. Why? Sorry for the things I said yesterday. Is that so? It's nothing. But actually, I couldn't sleep last night. I was thinking of the painful things you said. It really hurt. Sorry. Maybe it's best you stop talking to me. Hold on. I was just kidding. I don't really bear grudges. And since you apologized, I'm really fine. Countryman, I brought some sour broth. You have to try it. To prove that it has no poison, I'll eat with you. If you get sick, I won't stop you from shouting at your neighbors. As the saying goes, it's through your intestine... Through your large intestines? What? What are you saying? The man can prove herself through her intestine. That's how it goes. Whatever. I haven't eaten sour broth in a while. It's good. Just wanted to check if you're getting sick. We'll find out in a few hours or tomorrow if the poison takes effect. By the way, I'm Tonyo. Okay. Won't you ask for my name? Yeah, right. By the way, what's your name? You really look like a Lea. Your name suits you well. Countryman! Rooster's crow! Rooster's crow! What's up? Why are you here so early? I cooked spicy pork, this time with spring rolls. Unwrapped spring rolls. Isn't it a bit too early for spicy pork and unwrapped spring rolls. You're a bit unwrapped. I think you forgot to wear shorts. Don't worry, I closed my eyes. Sorry. Lea, your food's ready on the table. It's nothing. It's so nice to hear... "Thank you." Thank you because I'm still alive. The food yesterday was safe to eat. Come over here, join me. No need, I'm good. I'm good. It's not too nice to eat on the road. I'm not on the road. Not that close to it even. You don't want to join me? Actually I'd love to sit on a proper chair. Where is it nice to go around here? I want to explore this place. You know anywhere nice? I only heard of... Is it Root Canal? Bobaru Canal? Otaru. Just stupid, sorry. So have you ever been there? Is the water clear? How do I get there? Is it far from here? If you want to go there, you'll take the train for an hour or less. If you want to take the express, it's just 30 minutes, but more expensive. If you take the ferry, it's about 18-20 hours. But you get there, anyway. Lea, you could be a tourist guide. I am a tourist guide. What if you join me? Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. I'll take care of the food, the fare. But give me a Countryman discount. Are you blind? Can't you see I'm blind? So what if you're blind? I'll be your eyes, you'll be my tour guide. Countryman! Just wanted you to know I'm waiting. So hurry up! Good day, Otaru! Hey! Stop it. It's not their culture to shout out loud. It's getting dark. Tonyo! Tonyo! Don't do that. What's happening? What's happening? Nothing. There's a shark. Tonyo, don't sit too close to me. What? You're a little too close. I'm not too close. This is where my seat is. You're so grumpy. We need a little distance before we get close. Thank you, too. Tonyo! Really? -Tonyo! -Ouch! Why don't you wear this tiny floater. I was thinking, if only it were clean, it'd be nice to boat along our Pasig River. Right? I miss the Philippines. I miss being a first-class citizen. I miss speaking Tagalog. By the way, do you still have relatives back home? Yes, distant relatives. Mom and Dad have passed away. But our family's from Iloilo. Who do you think you are, do you speak the dialect there? What? You meant "Do you understand," not "Who do you think you are?" Are you fond of music boxes? Maybe a little. The music on my laptop contains a music box collection in iTunes. Well, nothing beats the real thing. Listen. This one, you have to turn it before it makes a sound. It takes some effort before you can get something from it. What's up? What? Why are you staring at me? Nothing. Hold on, you can see me? No, I just guessed. I'm not used to you being quiet. And I could feel your breath. It's nothing. Did you see that? See what? Nothing. And thanks for the music box. Really, it's nothing. Here, hold it. Thank you for coming with me. We click. We have similar similarities. I make you laugh. Just like now. I think I can make you happy even if I repeat the same jokes. So I'll repeat the same jokes. Perhaps tomorrow we could-- You want to invite me to your terrace? Let's have coffee, talk some more, listen to your music box. Countryman! Have you experienced winter? Yeah! I mean, not yet. Seriously? Well, yes. When you are being a Snow Queen. So cold-hearted! Is that so! Come on, Lea. Defrost your heart so you can finally warm up to me. You know, this place is so romantic. To be in someone's arms. Whatever. -Tonyo! -Ouch! What are you doing? "Open the basket." You never played that? No! Hello. No, I'm out of the house. Not just outside the house. I'm really out. I'm with my neighbor. Yes, he's Filipino. Hold on, my sister wants to talk to you. What do I say? Just talk to her. -I'm shy. -No. But Lea... -Go on. -Hello. Yes? Yes. Not really. Can we just talk later? Sure! Promise. Yes. What did she say? She warned me that if I don't marry you, she'd send me to jail. What? Did she really say that? No. I asked if she could call again later since we're in the middle of the tour. Wait a minute. What is the Japanese word for what we're doing? This is Ashiyu. The body benefits from soaking our feet. We don't even have to go to the onsen where you're completely naked. You know the meaning of "ashiyu"? What? I see you. A-shi-yu, I see you. Let's go. We've already got raisin feet. -Look at them. -I can see it so clearly. A-shi-yu. So you're a funny girl. You never asked me how I got blind. But do tell me. Temporarily blindness, the doctor said. Didn't know stress could cause blindness. I've been blind for four weeks. According to the doctor, if it doesn't change soon, this blackout is going to last forever. Why don't you make a wish to the sashimi shrine? Fushimi Shrine! Unfulfilled wishes hurt even more. So I won't even. But the world won't hear your wish if you don't even ask it. You really believe that you're always funny, huh? I'm fun because I'm fun to be with. Perhaps also because of my healthy lifestyle and diet. Maybe you should eat cabbage, it will make you happy. I heard this fact that people need to eat cabbage to be happy, lighthearted, for good vibes. You need that. I used to cook cabbage for someone before. Did he become happier? I guess. At the very least, I unbraided his intestines. Are you all right? I just suddenly felt my intestines. Tonyo? It's nothing, just heartburn. That was a burp, not heartburn. They're different. If they happen at the same time, heartburp. What do you miss doing? I miss riding a bike. Then ride a bike! But how? Why are you even asking? What kind of question is that? You're not lame. I'll take care of you. You just have to trust me. You just have to trust me. I'll help you ride a bike. You know what I miss? I miss dancing. Have you seen me dance? Not yet. Only now. If we dance, you'll see me, but I won't see you. Isn't that unfair? Put a blindfold on me so it's fair. It's done. Done. Game! Where is more spacious? Are you all right? Of course. Didn't you see I chased the cockroach? I just killed it. Back then, girls would go crazy. I used to be really good at dancing. -Really? -Yes. You don't have to question that. Am I taller than you? Am I taller than you? Quiet. It'll be our secret, just you and me. I haven't been circumcised. Why? How about this? Is this sweet? I have sake somewhere in the room. Let's drink. No, Tonyo. People who get drunk always have an evil plan. Evil plan? What if I just want to unwind? Look at you. And you accused me of having a plan. So I had an evil plan? I'm just tipsy. I'm a little drunk. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Left. Then right. Left again! Shit, Tonyo! Don't fool around, I might ram into something! No. Just go straight. I'll take care of you. Look how good I am! -Well, I'm better. -No way! How do you know you're already in love? When... When your world's different, when no one else is on your mind, and no one else comes first. You'll notice a change in your expressions, your face lights up whenever you see that person. What if you're blind? Sorry, did I offend you? I'm sorry. I just got so love-blind. She's blushing from what she heard. You know what? Countryman, you don't have to see a person. You just feel them. Like whenever you pee, right after the last drop, you feel it. It's that feeling. Oh, my countryman. I hope I still get to see you eventually. Knowing how I look, it doesn't matter, okay? It won't benefit the world. But it's different when who you're talking to has a face. Do you really want to see my face? Yes, of course. Hold on. Give me your hand. You have long eyelashes. Very soft cheeks. You have a mustache. Your nose is tall. I can sense that you're really handsome. I have a feeling, if I see you, you could be a celebrity. You really are blind. That's the padlock. Where's the key? Here. What's this? This is too big to be a key for a padlock. This might be a key for a house. It's the same, you're going to throw it, anyway. Oh, no. I want to keep mine. I'm keeping this. As you like. I ate a lot of cabbage. And I'm really happy we're together. Go! There you go! I get hungry whenever I hear a bell ring. I'm reminded of recess in school. If we were in the Philippines and I ate ramen noisily, my Mom would hit me on the head. If we were in the Philippines and I ate noisily, all my admirers would be turned off. Wow, she's bragging. Oh, come on. I'm just confident like you. Excuse me, I'm very humble, I just don't like telling people about it. Back home, so many girls have gone crazy for me. Would you believe that once they stormed our house. I told them, "Please, stop," because... I was already taken. Taken by whom? By you. Spin... I'm not there. I'm not there. -Where are you? -Ouch! What's so funny? This is my wedding gift for you. Wedding gift? This is just a pretend wedding. No one's getting tied. What are you saying? I'd love to get tied to you. I mean, to marry you. Just open it. What is it? Guess. What is it? The Ball of Love Potion. Seriously. Love Potion Doll. Love Potion Doll. Is that what it's called? Here, let me guide you in drawing the eye. Then make a wish. Where? There! Make it a happy wish. Hey. Don't cry. Who knows? Your wish might come tomorrow. And when it comes true, we can fill in the other eye. Why do I feel like we've known each other for a long time? Well, yeah. Yes. A couple of weeks already. If ever my sight does not return-- We'll still go places. But if your eyesight returns, we'll go back to the places we've been, and we'll drink a lot, we'll dance, we'll peck at each other. What did you say? Nothing. Tonyo! Lea! Lea, stay put. I'll be quick, don't move. Okay. My baby dragonfly. Countryman! Lea! Lea, I know it's difficult for you. I wish I'd met your friend before he died. But I'm still certain he'll stay with you. Wherever he is, he's watching over you. Okay? Return my call, please? Lea, today I just finished folding the thousandth paper crane and wished that you'd regain your sight tomorrow and that I'd give this letter to you. Dude, I just resigned today. Just tell my beloved ex-girlfriend how happy I am right now. Tell her I'm really happy. One beer, please. Tonyo... Tonyo... Try to forget her. You'll find someone better. Someone who will love you. So what? No one cares. Where are you going? Sapporo! Sapporo, stick with me, okay? Where are we going? Over there. Let's go. One. I only had one place in my mind, one choice of where to go: Sapporo. Away from everything. And away from the memories. One. I only had one great love then. Is it wrong to have just one love? Once, I also hit rock bottom because of that one. Let's dance. Two. It was just the two of us, Sapporo and I. Beer's so loyal, beer never left me. I will move on from you. Even if this goodbye seems smaller than a fetus step. Who is that? Let's take a selfie. Such a nice place. Sapporo, time for a selfie. Come on, you better smile. One, two, three. Where are we headed? You look good here. She's cute, too. Let's follow her. Come. Are you stalking me? Stop following me around. I'm not stalking you. Goodbye. Well, goodbye. Good morning. Three. I blinked three times. Three specks of dirt fell from my eye before I actually saw you. And since then, I regret nothing. Rise and shine. It's a beautiful day. I cooked some cabbage. They say it will make you happy. Bye. Sapporo? Sapporo? There you are. I thought you left me alone. Let's eat this. That woman gave it to us. Hold on, have some cabbage. Sapporo, what a coincidence! Look at the post. This house is for rent. And they kept the number a secret. Here. Let's call and look for the owner. Good morning. I brought water. When you drink beer, you need more water. Cabbage. More cabbage for you. Good morning. Cabbage. Please eat. Let me take these. Sorry, Lea. I'm not ready yet. Do you really want to get married? I need more time. Please understand. Just like a movie, I just need popcorn. Did you see that, Sapporo? You're just sleepy. You better rest. There's your cabbage. You should eat it so you'll be happy. People are scrambling to extend their lives, while you still have so much life, but you act like you're dead. What's wrong with you? Take a bath! Stop moping. Instead of drowning in beer, take a bath! Because you stink so bad! Four. You woke me up four times. But I only heard you the fourth time. I really stink. The soap that woman gave me smells so fresh. Where is that heart headed? Tonyo, don't follow her. You don't even know her. Why would you follow her? Stop it. One. Don't you... Five. Five times, I convinced myself not to follow you. But I couldn't resist following the heart. What time is Nobu's shift? He changed his shift. You want something to drink? Two? I got a banana drunk. That's what boys say to get the girls. Six. Exactly six drops of pee fell. I couldn't stop it. I don't know why I chose to pee in my banana suit because I lost sight of you for a few seconds. They say if you wanna release anger, breathe and then count from one to 10, so you can think of what to say, so that you won't hurt anyone. That's it. Seven. You struck the Bell of Happiness seven times. But that night, you didn't know how hard you struck a banana's heart, too. Okay, Banana. This is where I live. Come on, let's dance. Ouch! Banana, stop. You don't know how happy you made me. I don't regret entrusting my life to a banana for one night. Take care! I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Better do a good job. You shouldn't tell anyone. Seems like we're here at a bad time. You're so pretty. Can I do anything for you? I'll seem like a pervert. Good day. Are you Filipino? Me too. Let's have lunch? 8:00 p.m. at the Beer Garden. Yes, see you. See you! Eight. My world stopped for eight seconds. I've been late for eight minutes. But I knew those eight minutes mattered more to you. Let's meet at the beer garden at 8:00 p.m. Excuse me... Could you please... ...give this to that lady? Yes, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Nine. I was nine year of age when we learned that I had an enlarged heart. That the time will come for it to explode. My only wish is that before it explodes, I meet you. I told myself, "Life is short." When it's your time, it's your time. So just do whatever you want. Who are you? Ten. Ten huge steps from where I stood, you fell. Lea, I wrote you in case you see again and I chicken out of saying... Good day! My name is Tonyo. I was that beggar you fed cabbage. I was the Banana. And I saw your fiancÃ© kissing someone else. I'm not sure if I was right or wrong, but I hope you'll understand, Lea. Thank you for everything. You changed how I see things. You're weird. When you could see, you didn't see me. When you were blind, you saw me. Thank you, Countryman. Thank you, my baby dragonfly. Thank you, my heart. Still in love, Banana.
