(light slow music) (light wind blowing) (solemn music) (faint tapping) - [Narrator] Mother was always subdued, you know, listening to the sound of the piano at the cinema. So she had trouble separating herself from that reality. She wasn't crazy back then, the experience just made her feel safe, that's all. Pictures comforted her when nothing else would. That constant, flickering beam of light projecting silent images like ghosts on the screen, reminding her of everything she ever loved, allowing her to express all the emotions everyone else tried to stifle in her because of her illness. It was the countless hours and hours we spent together when movies were still silent and my world was contained. (slow paced music) - [Narrator] Excuse me. - Thank goodness we have each other, Charlie? (applauding) - Mom, come on. No one can hurt us in here. Let's stay for another show! - No, no, no, no, no, no, he may have followed us in here. We can't take the chance, we're gonna go! Let's go, let's go. (melancholy music) - Mom, you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Mom, mom! - Mom, give me a second. (faint groaning) What's wrong with her? - My mom's sick. - Here. Come on. Come on, I gotcha. Follow me. - What is it this time? Another lady friend? - No, mother, she's a perfect stranger. - She looks downright familiar to me. - She's not well. - Who are you? Do you know what to do about this? - I'm Charlie. She's my mother. When it's over, she'll want a blanket. (loud bell ringing) - Don't be long. - Shh. Wait here. I'll get you home safely after the show. (laughing) - Oh wait. Sh-sh-sh-sh. The managers gonna throw us out if he thinks I let my kid into the sauce. - Lily, wait, wait. Come move in with us. Move in with us then. I can take care of both of you. - Neddy! - Yeah! - Darling, I'm far too dangerous for a nice boy like you! You look like a boy I was in with love once. - She is the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. Mother, I'm gonna marry her before I enlist. - You're watching too many damn war movies! - Oh come on. - She's alright. But you're not goin' off to war. So you keep your pecker in your pants, you hear me, boy? - Yes. (upbeat music) (laughing) - Oh thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - James, I think I can handle that. Thank you, yes, yes. Come, my darling. - Goodbye darling. Shouldn't they put down their violins in the presence of a lady? - That's enough for you, young man. Here, sit. Now you try. (screaming) - Oh! Marry me. (laughing) - A wild boy like you? - Come on. Come on, stay for a while. - No, no, I-- - Why? - I have my own resources. I'm not that kind of girl. - Yes you are. - Come on. ♪ Oh, the moon shines bright along the Wabash ♪ ♪ From the fields comes the smell of new day ♪ Neddy has talent. What you have is genius. Perfect pitch. A musician's dream. - [Charlie] I felt entirely singled out and self-important. From that day on, we escaped into a dream world. Neddy transported both of us to a special place where we could all live together as a family. - Hello beautiful. - [Charlie] Something I had never known. - Neddy! - [Charlie] It was like being in a movie. Far, far away from the Wyatts and their wealth and you knack at punishing us when we just wanted freedom. We were absolutely happy living down the hall from Neddy and Ada. There was nothing wrong with it. For the first time in my life I felt at ease. - Do you happen to leave the door open? Hello? Oh. - Hi, Grandma. - [Lily] Hello. - I would like to know how you pay for all of this. - Well, we may not believe in the class system, but we do believe in class. - Uh-uh? - Mmhm. - And um, what kind of friends do you associate with? - I'm well taken care of. - Yes, I can see that. Is it Charlie's father? Is he, is he the one? Lily, I'll see to it that you don't have to worry about money, if you just promise me not to engage in this anymore. - Don't insult me, Mother. Leave if you think so little of me. (light music) - It's not just you I'm thinking of. (applauding) - Come, come, come here. - Mom. - Neddy. - You'll be fine. - Come on boys. Let's go get us the Hun. - Neddy. - [Charlie] When the costumes were all put away, the strength of her imagination terrified me. - Charlie, get up. - What is it, Mom? - I can't explain, hurry. Stay with me. Run when I say so! (ominous music) - [Charlie] With Neddy gone, she just started running again. Not from the Wyatts or anyone else in particular. - Mom, where are we going? Just from the voices - Somewhere where that kept coming back. - we'll be safe, Charlie. - Wait up. A light would flare in a distant corner and she'd take off. I was the one who could never escape, even when things were good. (light music) - Charlie, darling, would you please ask me for a dance? - [Charlie] On occasion I was her guardian and on occasion her accomplice. Searching, always searching for some new relationship in pursuit of some kind of security or redemption from her secret world, whatever it was, I could never provide. She felt she had an obligation to help the men she brought home. All she wanted was to (ominous music) help them she'd say. Help them get to that one safe place. Safety meant some alternate reality she always carried on about, I was too young to understand. Eroticism was like a narcotic for her, another illusion. Flight from the secret people who haunted her. - My mom's not well. When she faded into her illness, it left me out in the open. I hated it but I did what I could. At least in the movies, we really were safe for a while. (upbeat music) - Come on, Mom. - Hm. Thank you. - Maybe Neddy will surprise us and make it home with the first troops. (cheering) (upbeat music) - Come on, Mom, let's go home. - I missed you so much. - [Narrator] Oh I missed you too. I love you. - Lily? - Read it. (solemn music) - I can't. - [Lily] Merry Christmas! - Oh Lily! - Merry Christmas! - [Narrator] What is she doing? - Lily! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Lily! - [Lily] Merry Christmas! - Lily! (loud sobbing) - Come on now, honey, let's go home. - C'mon inside mommy. Lily refused to believe the inevitable of Neddy. She just couldn't imagine how he could have been killed moments before the armistice. Mom! Mom! Are you there? For weeks she convinced herself he was just missing and that he betrayed her. - [Narrator] Charlie is that you? - Mother's feeling oh so much better today. - Good, Are you sure? She won't come down. - No - It was Ada's boy. He and Lily were engaged. Killed the day of the armistice, can you believe? - [Charlie] I tried to look after things, but I was scared. That one safe place Lily referred to wasn't in the movies. (ominous music) (loud crackling) Mom! (chattering) Mom! She wanted to be dead. In a sense she already was. Mom! Fire was her security and her revenge. Mom! Come on, Mom! I didn't understand. - We've gotta go. I still don't. Mom! It's not my problem anymore. - It would be good for her, Charlie, to see you. Because if she sees you, she's going to want to get better. - [Narrator] You better say goodbye now. - Mom! - Lily. Lily darling, look who's here? Look who I brought. Lily. (grunting) - Traitor! You're a traitor! - It's too hasty. Please, all she needs is a little more time. - [Charlie] Sure, I understand the thinking of that time. After all, she destroyed the goddamn movie theater. - You be good. You be good, you understand. - No, no, no, no, no good! - Mom! - No Charlie! Charlie, please! - It was no secret Fred Wyatt hoped she'd die in that place. She's not crazy, Grandmother. - Edith, come. - This is a curse Charlie. - This chapter of our life is closed. - [Charlie] The court settlement was for the protection of the Wyatts and not her. Lily always said the best years of her life were when you sent her away to school in England. - Such a disgrace, it all had to come to this. (light slow music) - Why couldn't you have just got her safely out of the country again? I've changed my mind. I want to talk to Lily. - No. You need to hear them out, too. - [Nun] Your daughter is having quite a good day. I'll bring her in if you like. - [Grandmother] No, thank you. Not just yet. - Ah, Mrs. Wyatt. Good to see you. I believe you and Dr. Warren are old friends. - It's been years. - [Mrs. Wyatt] Dr. Warren. - Please. And you must be young Charlie. So ah, your Lily is not doing so well again. - No. - I'm anxious to hear Mrs. Stuart's opinion, Doctor. - Dr. Warren is very familiar with her history. Medication has had little effect. It enhances her delirium. - She suffers unnecessarily. We spoke of a new form of neurosurgery before her last hospitalization, Mrs. Wyatt, 20 years ago. It's painless, efficient and, with your permission, it could save her life. - By sticking a knife in her brain. - She poses a threat to the safety of this institution, seeing as she's so obsessed with any form of fire. - I can't afford another private home anymore. - I could easily transfer her to the provincial asylum at Whitby. She'd be under my direct supervision. - Why don't we speak with Lily? (light music) Lily? - Charlie! Oh, Darling! Charlie, my brave boy. Oh, you look so good today. You smell so good. - How are you, Mom? - Hm, Ede has been keeping you from me. Just like she did when you were little. - Ede's here. Do you want to come inside and visit? - No. This is not a safe place, despite the calm. You remind me of a boy I used to love. - Do you remember anything about him? - He used to smell like you. But I know you are his and that's enough. I was never very good at looking after you. Promise me you'll find a girl and start a family. She's waiting for you, Charlie. Your unborn daughter is waiting for you. Remember the field, our field our field. - Time is suspended for us. There is nothing more important in all our lives than the field. (melancholy music) Wait. I always tell your daughter, wait. He's coming. Charlie's coming for you. I was waiting there in the field for Tom, the piano man and Ede. - Ede's forgotten about us. Waiting to be pulled out of the fire, their fire. Two people don't come together for nothing. (light music) - You blinked. Let's try again Ede. - You'll be sure to have this portrait in your front window. - Well so that every idiot farm boy in the Catskills can oggle me, don't you dare sir. - Try to ignore the camera my dear. Lift your chin. - You know you could look father all you want but I am never going to say I'm yours forever to any man because I am my own forever. - You'll be an old maid soon enough, instead of providing an heir for this family. - Ede has an independent mind, the longer she has to dream up a future for herself the better off she'll be. - Ede and I want to stay for the concert mamma. - Oh I don't give a hoot. Willa wants to stay because she's heard that-- - Off you go girls and have some fun. - [Ede] Go! - I want to see this piano fellah. Everyone says he's gorgeous. - Oh Willa, you are such a little fool. He's here to sell pianos. - [Willa] Don't be such a pill. - Curse, it's just so blessed hot in here. - No more luxurious a sound in Christendom can be elicited than from a Wyatt upright piano. Its delicate keyboard, the finest imported ivory, is as fundamental as the quality of its mahogany sounding board. And now to demonstrate this remarkable piano my brother, Mr. Thomas Wyatt. (applauding) - Don't move, anyone please. My song can only be sung to a beautiful girl. One who is prepared to relinquish her soul. - Oh, no. I really, I mean I'm hardly a girl, sir. - Don't move your hand. Feel the sound. (piano solo) ♪ The wandering minstrel ♪ ♪ I a thing of shreds and patches ♪ ♪ And patches ♪ ♪ Of ballads, songs, and snatches ♪ ♪ And dreamy lullaby ♪ ♪ Are you in sentimental mood ♪ ♪ I'll sigh with you ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Sorrow ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - [Lily] Ede was trapped by the music. I still remember their voices. I was there like we all are when we're waiting to be born. The piano and I were allies. To be conceived is to be made visible. Struck like a match. Oh he promised to return when he was off the circuit. He wrote to her every week for months. But it was me that led them there, like your unborn daughter is waiting to lead you. Everything begins and ends in the fire. (ominous music) - [Ede] Mr. Wyatt? - There's been a terrible accident in the city, Miss Kilworth. Ah Tom slipped from a trolley car. and the horses, he hadn't even time to cry for help. Tom, Tom was killed. And, and we emptied his pockets, we found this note and these, for you and your parents. He often spoke of coming to see our family in the city. - Yes. What, what else did he tell you about me? - That he intended to marry you. Forgive me for imparting such horror. Seeing as how we were to be next of kin. - Thank you. - Come now, my darling, our family is troubled enough. We will light another? That card will spare not only you but your child. You're not fool enough to think it could be hidden forever. - I wish that Tom and I had never met. So we'd never have been parted like this. - A gift or a curse. There's nothing in this life that can't be born with grace. Nothing at all, my darling. - Mrs. Kilworth. I want to help. I feel it's my duty to assist your daughter in whatever way that I can, in memory of my brother. - Thank you. (light music) (grunting) - [Lily] My birth was never acknowledged by any of Ede's family. Only the field conceded my existence. I see the circles there. (screaming) The endless circles of life stretching back to the fire in the caves where the first of us was born. The field will always be safe. Never let it go, Charlie. Go back Charlie, go back to the field. - [Ede] Oh look at her, look at her. - Oh she's so! - Oh she's so pretty. Look at my little girl. (crying) Lily! Lily! I can't find her anywhere. You search the barn, Mother. I'm going to go look in the field. Lily! Lily, where are you! (faint winds blowing) (light music) (faint thudding) - Oh, (speaks foreign language)! Mrs. Kilworth! Ede! (speaks foreign language) - Please stop it, Mother! Stop this, stop it, Mother! - Oh sweet Jesus! - [Maid] Make her eyes close, Miss Ede. Make her eyes close! Make her eyes! - Shh shh shh. It's over now. Here. Take this. She'll sleep now. - What was that, Mother? What is wrong with her? - There's your answer. My grandparents, the Fagans. They hid their son, Uncle John Fagan, all of his adult life in the attic of the house we lived in in Dublin. They hid him out of shame because he had the falling sickness. Oh, it was more than that. He had visions. He heard voices. He wrote down their sayings all over the walls of the attic, on the furniture, on every scrap of paper John Fagan could get his hands on. He claimed he was trying to solve the plight of our mortal existence. Come, my darling, I have something to show you. - Oh, my (speaks foreign language). - He was a great artist, but he destroyed our home. Possessed he was. Perhaps this should have been destroyed years ago. I never had the courage. My Mom declared them sacred. There. The key to the secret. You see, John Fagan created a blazing fire in that attic that consumed both himself and my grandparents too. And in his madness, he laid a curse on all of us. My family had money so we fled here to Canada in shame. Your father knows nothing of this wretched business. I've lied to him, all these years. God forbid, this is my penance now. Or yours for your sin, Ede. - Oh my God! We keep this between ourselves, Mother. All I want for Lily is to have a family and a happy life. And I'm going to do what I have to to make sure she gets that. (solemn music) - [Lily] Ede told me her mother destroyed the journals. But I know they exist at the very heart of the house in the field. Oh find them, Charlie. Please, oh find them and you can set me free. No! - I can't get you out! You're here because of the courts, alright? - No, no, Charlie. Please, please find them. Please. - Okay, okay. - [Charlie] I'll try. Come on inside. Okay? I'll take care of you. Alright? I won't let Ede move you to a public institution. I've got a good job. I'll find some way of making things work out, I promise. (upbeat music) The Wyatts made a fortune in the piano business. My grandfather used it to shove my mother away. Until my grandfather lost the business, Wyatt piano was the largest manufacturer in the British Empire. - Well, we've all been knocked down by hard times. Does your mother ever leave the asylum? - Not for years. She blamed me for leaving her. - Did she? Well, I may just show you how wild my upbringing was. Have a little drink with me, huh? We'll get drunk. - [Charlie] Let's dance. (laughing) (applauding) - Please, have a seat. Very smooth, Charlie. But this is where it ends, understand? The husband is back next weekend and ah, I don't want any lingering gossip. So ah, why don't you rest your feet? - [Narrator] We'd like to introduce you to the lovely and illustrious Alex Lamont. ♪ I can't remember the place ♪ ♪ You said hello to me ♪ ♪ Your face is all I seem to see ♪ ♪ Your smile ♪ (faint upbeat music) (loud knocking) - So, do you think the hotel would let you join us on the bandstand for a little fun? - Sure. In-between organizing shuffleboard playoffs. - I've been trying to persuade Ernie, the band leader, to throw a couple of dance routines into the act. Something different, buzz the crowd, so we get rebooked when we play. - Look, ah, the manager thinks your band is great. We'll rebook you guys if anything falls out of the schedule late summer, alright? - Look, I'm not trying to butter you up. You were sensational tonight. (light music) You'd be a knockout with me. - Hm. Cocktail hour only by day. I'm a lug, good night. (giggling) - Hey honey, I drove... - Frank! (shattering) - Don't fuck with lawyers' wives, Charlie. Look, you've done two superb summers for me. - Come on, I cut your entertainment cost in half. You wouldn't be open if it wasn't for me. - A good lookin' guy like you can have any dame he wants. Why don't you get married? Come on, smarten up. (ringing) Yeah, yeah. (solemn music) - [Singer] Hey, I'm really glad he changed his mind. - [Charlie] Mr. Baker. ♪ Pink champagne is crazy ♪ ♪ Pink champagne is nice ♪ ♪ When I'm feeling lazy ♪ ♪ I throw a bottle on ice ♪ (upbeat piano solo) (applause) (light slow paced music) - Wow. You know, I haven't heard that kind of applause in months. You really do have the Midas Touch. - I'm gonna head in. I'll catch ya tomorrow. (solemn music) - Alex Lamont, you are a dish. - [Alex] Mmhm. - They want us back for Labor Day. - [Alex] That's good. - Big bonuses for everybody. - [Alex] Great. - Thanks, hon. - Ernie. - A boy that good looking usually likes other boys, you know. - You know, it's easy to be a critic when your own trombone don't blow anymore. (laughing) - I have more in my little finger than that fruit fly has got between his legs. - [Narrator] Can you come to town? - No, I can't come. I'm on a bus today. - [Narrator] There's been an accident, Lily's been arrested. - Arrested? But did it burn down? - This court and find her not guilty by reason of insanity. This court also accepts the proposal submitted by Mrs. Edith Wyatt that her daughter be returned to a public facility, acceptable to this court. - [Narrator] She's your responsibility. - I, no, I can't, I can't. Well this is a new job. - [Narrator] But the court says. - I'm travelling right now. There are six more instrument cases in the ballroom, alright? - [Narrator] I don't want to make this decision myself. - Okay, alright, I'll see what I can do. Put this with my bag. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I know, it's not your fault. Right. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye. - [Man In Red] Can I take your bag, sir? - Thank you, thank you very much. (upbeat music) (applauding) - [Charlie] Thank you - Thank you - Come on. - Thank you very much, she's on her own for the rest of the night. - For God sakes Ernie the tent's leaking, we're soaked. - [Ernie] Get lost. - What the hell are you doing? - What I should've done a long time ago. - What are you kidding me? Ladies and gentlemen, the lovely and talented Ernie Baker will now roll out a little number called the Wet Blanket Blues. That's it for me, thank you goodnight. (applauding) - Cute. (light music) - That bastard deserves a boot in the arse. My guys are all flipping. - Ernie's breaking up in the hooch, he'll forget about it, so will you. - Christ get me a scotch then, my feet are like blocks of ice. My dress. Hey where you going? - [Charlie] Good show tonight. Which would say little for me. Hey, the bus is here. - [Narrator] Alright, coming out. (train horn whistles) - No! Charlie, where the hell are you going! I don't understand! Get off me! Don't! - Forget about him. - Charlie! - Alex. - [Alex] Charlie! - What do you mean she's escaped? They had no business bringing her here! Where is Dr. Warren? Where is she? - I didn't want to tell you. She got out. We're hoping the police find Lily. (melancholy music) - Lily. Always leaving behind bits and pieces of your life with the proficiency of an escape artist. Too bad none of your entanglements ever worked out so that there was someone other than just me. If I find her I'm going to try and take care of her here. Lily would be isolated. It's a very tolerant community on this island. - What you're proposing is a very expensive appeal. The court wants her in a supervised home. How could you ever provide the round-the-clock care that they'd insist on? - Well, how much principal is set aside for me in the trust? - Charlie, your benefactor left you that money to provide for your education and your children's education. - Well then it's time we met. They need to know that I'm never having any children. - Anonymity is a condition of the bequest. I recommend that you approach your grandmother again and appeal to her. Not the courts. - She's my benefactor isn't she? - Come now, you know that the individual's whereabouts will never be revealed unless they themselves wish to tell you. Good day, Charlie. (melancholy music) - [Narrator] Is this it guys? - Still no news of Lily. I ah, met with our lawyer. I decided to use my income for Lily's care. You provided me with a decent upbringing. For that I'm grateful. But I want what's mine. - The Wyatts have never had anything to do with your money, Charlie. That was all Lily's doing. And your invisible father, I suppose. - She can't even remember who he was. - No, and no amount of money will help her now. So you go on. Get on with your life. Leave the past alone. - You married Frederick. You should have left well enough alone. Instead of letting him poison your attitudes about Lily. - Fred was not the monster Lily made of him. When he married me, he gave Lily and I our freedom. This house was full of happy memories. I did love Frederick, I tried. - My man needs a position on the switches upstairs Mrs. Wyatt your husband said to check with you. - Oh my husband is so obsessed with new inventions. Look I've chosen the wallpaper for my daughter's room. But she arrives soon so do you think we can have it done? - Certainly. - Lovely, thank you. Hello? Oh I guess that's fine. Oh can I borrow this lantern? - Mhmm - I've never even seen the top floor of this monstrosity. (ominous music) - [Mrs. Wyatt] People do things they can't explain. The doing has a reason of it's own. I tried to face my apprehension head on. Hello? The specter of the attic in Dublic haunted me. (loud train whistle blows) - I intend for this to be our signature. Right across North America Frank. - Far too tame. The fellah should be playing the piano while the woman dances for him. But you always know everything, brother. - In a saloon maybe. These are parlour pianos. - No, he should be playing the piano and she should be holding the rose looking at him longingly. I mean, well every woman in the world associates music with love. - Women do not buy pianos, men do, Mrs. Wyatt. - Yes but it's the women that persuade them it's a necessity. - Fire my wife Frank, and repaint it with the man playing, no rose and leave in the chaperone. - I hope Lizzie hasn't lost your mother in here, Edith. - Frederick um... - Aah. - Now that my mother um. - These are excellent. Excellent. - Now that she's brought Lily from the farm, there's something I need you to understand. - Yeah, come over this way, Edith. - Thank you, sir, ma'am. - See Ede, we're trying to double our production within 12 months. (speaks foreign language) - It's, it's Lily. It's that she's so completely dependent on me. A little while ago she had a seizure. - That's not uncommon in childhood is it? - No but, I've taken her to specialists and they say that she has this condition. It's something that they can't label. - Well you better keep that to yourself. I will not put up with a lot of medical nonsense. She could live out on the farm. Besides, we've got our own family to build. I want society to adore you. We're at the heart of a cultural industry. Wyatt Piano. It's going to be the finest instrument in North America. You can't afford to be preoccupied by things that will hold us back. Just look. Breeze on by. You'll get use to it. - Breeze on by? - Stop that Lily! It's on your head if she falls, Ede Mary Kilworth. Will you get that ridiculous brother of yours to get Lily down, Fred Wyatt. - Oh don't worry, Mrs. Kilworth. I won't let her fall. (light music) - Thank goodness for Fred's younger brother. He was a wild boy. But, as they grew up - Come on, let's fly. - [Ede] he took her under his wing like a sister. I encouraged a friendship with Lizzie. Despite what you may have heard. (light music) - Lily Kilworth! What are you doing out here, child?! Will you get in the house and help your Mom with her two babies. - I'm not a child, Grandmother! - And you too, Lizzie Wyatt. You aren't here to horse play with the hired hands! - Lizzie, Lizzie! Fred's just sent word, Lizzie has to return. Old Mr. Wyatt's had a setback, and needs them there to take care of their father. - I'll tell you what that boy needs. He needs the company of friends. Summer cotillions, being educated with men. Not being locked up in a death room. - I can't spend my entire life worrying about those damned Wyatt brothers, I have enough trouble. - What did you say? - I said damn, hot damn and God damn and Frederick be damned. - Ede Kilworth what's possessed you? You've let that husband turn your heart cold, that's what. Oh Lily darling, come with me. (melancholy music) - [Lily] Why do you come here without your husband? - Well, I guess sometimes I just need to sleep in my old room with all my babies. - How do I know they're really my brother and sister? - Oh, come on, Lily. Don't be tiresome. - They don't have spells. - Yes, well, you know, not everybody has spells. Come on, let's get you ready for bed. - There's not enough room in here. I'll sleep in Lizzie's. - You will not sleep with Lizzie. You will march right back here. Lizzie's 19. He's too old to sleep with children. - If I asked him and he says yes? - Well he's not going to say yes. - Why? - Because. - Is it because of my illness? - Yes. - That's not true. - Lily. Lily! (baby crying) (ominous music) - Listen. I was born here. Thousands of creatures all around. - Lily, Lily!I'll sigh with you Lily, it's alright. Lily, Lily! Hold on, okay? Look at the flame. Look. - I was lost. - No, no, you weren't. - I was afraid, there were voices there. - No, it was only me. Shh. - [Ede] "Someone is in there", she'd say to me. Every time I light a match, I see them. I was as terrified as she was. Believe it or not, money and social standing were the two things that stood in our way. - Merry Christmas. - [Ede] Acceptability for Lily became more important than even a happy family life. - Your parents are expecting you. - Oh gratefully Charlotte, a masterpiece. - Oh, bring me a jug of boiling water to dip the knife into! Oh! Into bed with you now, Miss Lil! - Oh, Mom, I don't feel well. - Maggie, fetch Miss Browning, for the love of mike. Miss Lil is havin' a spell. Hang on now, my lovely. I need boiling water! (ominous music) - Oh Lily. - Stop that! - Take her feet. - Now! - Get her in, get her in. Be careful, carefully now, be careful. It's okay sweetie. Fetch me a blanket, fetch me a blanket. - To the next room. If you feel your illness coming on, take this stick, bang on this spot on the floor for nurse Browning. I trust you know why this is necessary. - Yes sir. - We love you. I trust you really know that. - Yes sir. - Kiss me then. Remember, we always meet and part with a kiss in this family. Right then. - I am taking her down right this minute! We learned to live with this! - I cannot afford to be shut out by your irresponsibility. I have the burden of an expanding business. I have no intention of letting that child stand in our way! - No! Stop it! She can't hurt our reputations! Only we can! You bastard! (loud grunting) Ow! (loud slap) - Wyatt Piano is going to make us a fortune and she has set us back months. God knows, some of those guests may never come back to this house! This is about survival. It is survival and it is acceptance. - I don't want acceptance! I thought you loved me! (melancholy music) - No man would have said that. Only a woman. Be grateful for the rest of your life. I'm prepared to love you. - Wait yes-- - Lily is your mistake. Yours and Tom's, not mine! - I'm afraid I can't, I'm afraid I can't, I'm just so scared that this is going to kill her that she's going to suffocate up there and I can't-- - Then it's your job to make sure that she doesn't if the life you want for her includes living under this roof. - [Ede] Fred couldn't just will Lily into non-existence. I should have taken her back to the farm, but I was frightened something vital between us would be over. That was selfish I know. Lizzie became my ally. - You're not alone, Lily! Lily! Lily? Lily? - Oh. Lizzie - [Ede] Her spells always decreased with his attention. - How are you? - Good. - I brought you some cake. - [Ede] And life was normal for a while. - I've convinced Fred to send you to a proper school in the fall. Well, he's been so kind to me ever since father died. He got me a job in the Newmarket depot which is right near St. Mary Margaret's Ladies Academy. We can see each other for 100 years there. (light music) - [Ede] My greatest fear, was that Lily would perish out of my sight, alone. She needed help, it was selfish to contain her up there in the attic. - Drive Mrs. Wyatt around the countryside Vincent. - You're going to have lots of new friends. Friends outside the family finally. You'll never be alone. Her life had been devoid of strangers for so long, seeing as she saw so few people other than family. It was all I could do to get her back to the safety of my parents, and the freedom of the Kilworth farm. (laughing) - Hello! Alright we're here. Hi! I'll put the buggy away. - [Narrator] I missed you! (horse neighs) - [Lizzie] Hey, whoa! Whoa! - [Lily] Lizzie! (ominous music) Lizzie! Lizzie! - Ede tells me the lad's complained of headaches for the past two years, ever since his father died. And since the accident he seems not able to speak. He's really very frightened. That's a boy. - A word James. (laughing) - Willa, will you get those babies to hush up! - Mucous, loss of speech. The concussion may have set off a pre-existing tumour of the brain. - Oh dear God. - [Doctor] He's not going anywhere in this condition. If I can reach Dr. Omar Warren at St. Mike's and persuade him to come. - [Narrator] Well Ede's in the city. She can bring him up right away. (solemn music) - Hold the lamp absolutely still. Fingers, Melbourne. Pressure points, you know that. - Sorry, the flow was damn hearty. - I can take it out piecemeal. If I cut it out altogether he'll be paralyzed. What did you say his name was? - It's Lisgard Wyatt Jr., Doctor. - Oh my God! - Perhaps letting her fall in love with Lizzie was my fault. She blamed me, but it was our fate. Now our lives are cursed. You know that, Charlie. - I can't, I can't, I can't! - That the spectre of the Fagans was there in every shadow Lily ever tried to hide in, in every fire that she lit. - Mom, you okay?! Mom! Who's in there?! (loud slapping) - Don't you ever let him in here again ever! Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. Charlie, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Here. Here, sweetie. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. - Mrs. Frederick Wyatt please. On Jarvis Street. Thank you, operator. (melancholy music) I'm alright, I'm alright. What are you doing? Where are we going? - Come on, Lily. Charlie, sit there. You wait there for me. - Mrs. Wyatt. - [Edie] Oh, Dr. Warren. - Good morning. - I'm so sorry to disturb you at such an early hour. - Lily is always welcome. You remember my associate from Denmark. - Yes. - Hello Hamlet. - Very well, Mrs. Browning. Off you go to Elsina castle. - Thank you. - Do you see what I mean? - Yes. - You see how bad she is. - [Warren] Please sit down, Mrs. Wyatt. If we separate the lobes in this area here, we could remove all symptoms and anxiety forever. She would spend the rest of her life content. - And how do you perform this procedure, doctor? - With a surgical blade inserted through the nasal cavity. - Charlie! - [Charlie] He's going to kill her! - Charlie! Charlie, stop! (honking) Oh! - He'll kill her. - Oh Charlie. - She isn't crazy. Someone came in the middle of the night. - In the middle of the night? What did, what, did someone try to hurt her? - It's a man. He, he comes to see her once in a while. - Who is he? Charlie? Yeah, what is his name? No, you tell me! What is his name! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! You! You tell me. Tell me who it is! - John. - What? - John Fagan. (solemn music) - Oh my God! - Promise you won't let that doctor kill her? - Yes, I promise. Oh dear God, I promise. And I've always kept my promise. I just wanted to help her. You couldn't see it then, but did you think I never knew what Lily suffered or the people she talked to in the flames. I knew your mother needed the kind of help none of us could give her. I told you I didn't want to make a decision on my own. - You did it, didn't you? - No one else would. - [Charlie] Thank God she got away! (piano solo) - Christ. - You know, if you couldn't stand me, you could have at least had the guts to tell me to my face. (piano solo) You've changed careers. - It's a living. Are you with the Rominalios? - Yes I am. They've been very good to me. - Maybe you oughta stick around. See if the accompaniment is any good, huh? - Trying to weasel back in my good books without an audition? Uh-uh. ♪ I wake up and I love you madly ♪ ♪ Dreaming of you ♪ ♪ Dreaming of you ♪ ♪ Dreaming of you ♪ (applauding) Thank you. Thank you so much and we hope you'll join us in the King Eddy Room again for another wonderful evening, thank you. (applauding) (upbeat music) Isn't it fabulous? - Would you care to dance? - No. I'm off duty and this room is way too hot. Come on. - This hotel treats its stars like royalty and these guys have been playing here for years. So I'm just slumming it until I find a permanent place. Cheers. - Thanks, who's this? (faint knocking) - Oh, that's my daddy. You know, he'd never approve of me drinking champagne and having a man in my hotel suite. Hello? - Would your boss like his suit pressed overnight? - No, I don't think so. Thank you very much. Thank you, good night. - Do your parents ever come to hear you sing? - Ah, no. They're both dead. It's sad. - My father died before I was born. - Really? I'm sorry. - Do you believe in life after death? - Ah, actually I'm spending most of my time trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing here. - All of us exist long before the visible parts of our lives begin. This flame was energy before I struck this match. Smoke. Out there somewhere. My father out there. I always wanted to know where. - Some things in life just can't be altered. I didn't hurt you before when I hit you on the back of the had did I? I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Is it okay? - Mhm. - I'll just put that there. - This is great. My mother and I used to dance in the ballroom here when I was a kid. She never had an escort so I'd go along. - You have beautiful hands. You make me very nervous, Charlie. - We need to talk. - No. Please. (upbeat music) - Isn't this wonderful? - Yeah, it beats piano tuning. - Don't wish for what you really want or you just might get it, huh? - What do you really want? - Really? I want a home. Kids. (applauding) - Step out a minute, I just need some air. (light music) ♪ I should have seen ♪ ♪ Your smile ♪ - Hey Brian. Tell Alex I'm taking my break out here alright? - Oh, that's all right. Let's walk. Glorious day. (slow paced music) - [Narrator] Eleanor! - [Charlie] Lily! Lily? Lily! (applauding) - [Narrator] We are extremely pleased to have the much publicized support of Mrs. Eleanor Hess on her Commonwealth tour Lady Bessborough. (applauding) - Mrs. Hess has contributed $5,000 towards the sponsorship of the King's Third Rifle Division. (applauding) - Thank you. Thank you Lady Bessborough. My goodness it has been, 30 years since I last enjoyed the pleasure of your fair city. (applauding) My donation to the Third Rifle Division-- (screaming) - Eleanor! Whoo-oo! Eleanor! St. Mary Margarets forever! She wouldn't know one end of a rifle if it bit you! - Mom, what are you screaming at? I have a place you can hide. I want to help. Sorry, sorry. Mom, now you can't run around like this. You can come back to my place. I want to help. - Oh you want to help? Come on. (choir singing foreign language) - [Charlie] Where the hell have you been? - [Lily] Follow me. - [Charlie] Lily! - [Lily] Follow me. - [Charlie] Lily! - He's here, you know. - Who? - John Fagan. I can't come till it's done. - Mom, there's nobody here. - I know, I know. But it's all in flames. It's always on fire. They're all on fire. And I can't put out the flames. Oh, have faith Charlie, Charlie, have faith. - I have faith in myself. I just want to get on with my own bloody life and forget all these damn Fagans. - Charlie, you're in church. You don't talk like that in church! - Oh mother, shut up and come with me. - Oh, listen, listen. Oh, Charlie, listen. Listen. The singing, do you hear it, Charlie? Oh, you can hear it. The world is singing. Sing, Charlie. Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing, Charlie, sing. I can count on you. I can always count on you. - No you can't. You can't count on me. I'm glad we put you away. Because you're a psychopath and I'm not going to be sucked in after all these years by your incessant horseshit! - No, no, you're gonna help me get John Fagan's books. - No. Enough of the Fagans and the Kilworths and their damn superstitions. - You're not going to let - [Lily] Ede destroy them. (screaming) - Listen to me! All your life you run and I have followed. Now you'll do what I want. (ominous music) - [Pastor] Mind your business boys. Come along. - Lily! Lily! Lily! (loud honking) - [Man In Red] Have a seat. (loud winds) (ominous music) - [Charlie] I'm looking for a woman with red hair, sweater? - [Man In Red] I don't know sir. - Excuse me. Lily? Lily! Give me a hand here. Thanks. - [Narrator] What on earth is going on? - [Narrator] What's she doing? - What the? Goddamn it, Mother! You'll get us all arrested. - Is there anyone in charge here? - Those stars have been dead for thousands of years. The light just carries on. Reaches us here. The stars are like ghosts. Life, time, passes on its gifts, long after I'm gone. (slow paced music) - You can keep your gifts. I just want to make sure you're safe. - Oh, you always wanted that. You're my guardian. - What are you talkin' about? - My guardian angel. Just like Eleanor. - Who's Eleanor? - I called out to her in the park today. Eleanor Hess. We went to school together. So rich. Pictures all over the paper. I miss her. I need to help her. - Help yourself, Mom. Help yourself. - Mrs. Eleanor Hess? You do? Well could you tell her that Charlie Kilworth called. Thanks. Can you connect me with Alex Lamont? She's not? (ominous music) Lily! Christ, I'm losing my mind. Lily! Lily! But I have a delivery for Mrs. Hess. Yes, well do you have any idea when she'll be returning? - She's very eccentric. Two security guards. What happened with you and Alex? I heard Alex told Rominalio off and he fired her. - Alex, wait! Where are you going? - How dare you? Chasing after some old bitch again in the middle of the best gig I ever had. Don't grab me! - I was chasing after my mother all night! - Well it was unprofessional. Look, this is show business, sweetheart. You never walk out in the middle of the act. - Look these are for a Miss Eleanor Hess. - Oh, very nice. - Alright, she's a friend of Lily's. She staying here at the hotel. Look, if the police find Lily this bastard neurologist is going to sever her brain for some humanitarian belief or some other crap. - Well I really don't care. I wiped up the rest of our gig solo and got myself fired because of you! - Alex, I'm sorry. It's, this this Mrs. Hess, she went to school with Lily. And she's a philanthropist. Maybe she can help me get her into a better home. Maybe things will turn around for me. You know, for us. - Oh, Charlie. - Just, I just, I don't know what else the hell to do. - You're a jerk. Loretta please. Loretta? Listen, ah there's a Mrs. Hess staying in the hotel. Yeah, well what's her room number, honey? She left me a message. I can't get back to her. Oh, I promise. Thank you so much. You're a doll. Hey lunch sometime, okay on me. Bye. Prime Minister's Suite, huh? Not even the prime minister gets in. You're welcome. - I'm sorry, sir, she's not available. - [Narrator] What is the disturbance? - He says he's Charlie Kilworth. (shattering) (melancholy music) - Thank you so much, madam. It was an experience wasn't it, darling? You, you have performed a miracle. Goodbye. Goodbye, dear hearts. Bye bye. Hello. - Hello. - Since I was here in Toronto, Lily was to be the subject of our little séance today. And now you walk in here. It's unadulterated Kismet. - Well, she ah she said she saw you at the armoury yesterday. She tried to get your attention, but then she ran away. - Oh dear. I have waited my entire life to meet you, dear boy. Let us go find her. - [Charlie] She came in here yesterday for safety. - Yes, she always lived in another world. That's why I loved her. - She kept saying she needed to help you, Miss Hess. Excuse me, Father. Do you remember me? - With that street woman. - She's my mother. I'm looking for her. - I have seen her before outside the city where all the itinerants camp. - Can you show us where she is, Father darling? - Thanks. Did you ever know my father? - What did Lily tell you? - She ah, she always said she misplaced the authorship of my life years ago. - Lily was always lost. She would run straight into the arms of Genghis Khan, if she trusted him. Oh, I never had a more joyous time in my entire life than my years with her. (light music) - We are the brightest, the most imaginative, the most committed generation of women in history to march forward into this new century. - [Eleanor] You remember how your grandfather tried to put her out of sight. - This year's lady Margaret trophy is awarded to Mrs. Lily Kilworth. - [Eleanor] But Lily was Lily. Nothing could ever erase her spirit. She could turn a prize into the uninhibited exploration of the male species. With the talent of a professional escape artist. God she was fun. One minute leaning out a window 17 stories high or running out into the middle of traffic or lighting one of those damned fires of hers. (laughing) - Shh, dragon lady's coming! (light music) - Girls, girls girls. It has long been rumored, that the infamous Mrs. Kepel is a blood relative of yours Mrs. Ormond. - Yes Mrs. Richter, she is my favorite aunt. And she is her Royal Highness's Majesty's favorite mistress. She's taught him his lessons for years. Oh please don't take it away. - Mrs. Richter you see the truth is Mrs. Kepel's really Eleanor's mother. She's just far too embarrassed to tell you the truth. - What more is there to tell? - The King is my father. We were expelled immediately. - Time ladies, please place your pencils on the desks until all papers are accounted for. On behalf of the University of Cambridge it is my pleasure to collect the results of the Empire Students Matriculation Examination. - [Eleanor] But since my father was actually a British diplomat, I managed to persuade him to arrange for Lily to write for the scholarship at Cambridge. Do you remember the Wyatt's were sending your Uncle Franklin to London for the piano company? We used to go to lunch on board wearing no underwear. And made each other up at courtesans to practice seducing older men. Fell in and out of love at least once a week. We were promiscuous but it was a game. Lil! I've been down to the brook and there with fantastic arms, do the naked swimmers come! (loud coughing) Oh, you've been so damnably preoccupied all week, Lil. Snap out of it! - I'm writing my love poems. - What the devil are you doing with walnut extract? - You see, it's part of my condition. Mr. Browning refers to me as his little Portugesa. - How do I love thee? Let me count the ways? You don't want to be Elizabeth Barrett Browning, darling. The woman had a horrible death. She died of consumption. Now I'm in very serious trouble. Hurry up. Snap out of it! - You mean you're in love again. Is he handsome? - Oh God like. - Blonde. - Oh. Welcome back to the real world, Lil! (upbeat music) He's truly delicious. - I never really fell in love until I met my first husband. That was serious. - Eleanor! Oh really? Not again. - Oh come on Lil, don't be an old vag. Come on, hurry up! Wait for me! (screaming) Hurry up Lil! (cheering) - Bloody Kraut! What the devil business has he on the team? He's a spy no doubt! - We are an exclusively British team. - He's so full of himself. I don't know why I allowed you to talk me into this. This is so embarrassing. - [Narrator] Girls! - Guys never rest! - I'm glad your uncle is here. - [Lily] Hello! - Mr. Wyatt! Charles! I'd like to introduce you to my cousin. Charles? My dearest friend Lily Kilworth. And her Uncle Mr. Franklin Wyatt of the Wyatt Piano Company from Canada. Mr. Wyatt has just opened an office in London. - Everybody has their hopes pinned on you to set a new world record at the Stockholm Olympics. - Little Eleanor stands to break some records of her own I wager Mr. Wyatt. Haven't you read last week's financial times? How did our Uncle Montgomery's dying finger fall so entirely on your name my dear. - He was a dear old thing, and I loved him like a grandparent. (laughing) Come have some refreshment Mr. Wyatt. - Mr. Wyatt can't stay, we're going to the theater. - Damn it. Fellows! I'd like to introduce you to my third cousin Eleanor Ormond. Now the seventh richest woman in the United Kingdom. - [Narrator] Are we hearing weddings bells? What do you seriously consider your chances? - Eleanor! Oh, Eleanor! I've heard that your father's outside to take you away. What's going on? - Let's go. This is absolutely mortifying. Charles fed all that rubbish to those reporters just to provoke my poor father. My relations are all spoiled, unscrupulous pirate. - They must want a fight. - Charles's mother has sued father for fraudulently influencing Uncle Monty leaving his entire estate to me. I'm being dragged to meet the lawyers now. Don't look. That's a detective hired to spy on me. - Eleanor, you have to put your foot down. You're the only one who can take charge. - God help me, I hope so Lil. - Go. (melancholy music) - When I tell you what happened, you're going to think we were loose women but we weren't. Sorry, sorry, sorry! (laughing) - [Narrator] Oh watch your dress! - Ugh always dreamed of being someone else, now I'm you. - We must be out of our minds. - Eleanor, take this. Don't let Prince Charming get the upper hand, alright? - [Eleanor] We devised a plan in which Lily would dress up as me, so she could draw the detective Mr. Steelrims to the Guy Fawkes party at Cambridge, while I tried to settle my family's affairs with my cousin. - Go, go! - Darling El? - Charles? - What are we going to do about all this horseshit? - You and I need to find a way to put this controversy behind us. - Look, come by the country place then and stay for a day. My mother's dying to clear things up with you. - Yes but I can't stay over. I need to be back for Guy Fawkes. (loud crackling) fireworks popping) (ominous music) By the time Mr. Steelrims finally caught up at the University Lily was nowhere to be seen. So he went to the local pub for a hot toddy. - [Charles] Do you remember how we played together at the stables El? That's when I first fell for you. - Charles, I've written a few settlement ideas down. I feel we should discuss, before we meet your mother. - Oh don't be so businesslike. This mess has been caused by lawyers not mother. I have a much easier solution. - No! - El darling I meant all that silly stuff I said in the press. - No! - I do love you. Always have - No! - [Eleanor] No, no, no, no. No, no, no. - Shh. (ominous music) - [Eleanor] No, no! - [Charles] It's only fair to split the wealth that belongs to both of our families! - [Eleanor] No! - We could marry for a while. - [Eleanor] No! - Yes! - No! No! No! (shattering) (screaming) (loud crashing) (ominous music) (loud knocking) - Excuse me, Miss Ormond. There are police downstairs in the common room. They're requesting to speak to you. - Yes. How careless. Thank you, officer. I am grateful that my mother insists on labeling every single article of clothing that I own. - Charles Ormond was found this morning in the charred wreckage of his car at the family estate at Suffolk. This metal handbag was found nearby with some tomes in it which you wrote to him about. We need a statement of your whereabouts last evening, Miss Ormond. - Mr. Rutherford, you followed me home from the concert last evening. Perhaps you thought it was too dark to notice, but be good enough to tell these police officers where I went. - Officers, Angus Rutherford. Normally Mrs. Ormond and I we aren't supposed to acknowledge each other's presence. - Charles Ormond's mother has stated that your father threatened to do him in if he didn't leave you alone. Ain't that note of yours a little suspicious? - I have no knowledge of how it came into his possession. - That dick there can say what he likes. But what we're talking about here is murder, dearie. - No good deed goes unpunished. - I don't care how clever you pretend to be or how wealthy you are, no one gets away with murder in this country, no matter how rich. (ominous music) (ringing) - Hello. She's not in. Who's calling? I'll be right there. (light music) What is this place? - We are artists and writers here and one musician, Karl the chairman. He's the one who telephoned about your friend. - Lily. Her name is Lily. - Lily. She couldn't tell us her name. Lily. Refused to leave Karl's bed. We had to go in and rescue him. She's very strong. - Where is she? - She's in there now. (solemn music) - Hello. Look where've you got to. Lil, don't ever leave me like this again, Lil. - Hello, Elizabeth. - Miss Ormond, this is Cadet Hess. Miss Ormond. - Born in Munich. Living one year in Cambridge now. Students exchange. Karl Hess, at your service. - Come let's get Lily's things. - Lily would never give in to the stranger inside her. She would disappear. She was lost. But something in Karl had pulled at your mother's other self. With his music and his kind heart. It was what I loved in both of them Lil? Karl? Lil, Karl, come and have some lunch! Lil? Karl? Come and play your flute! Lil? (heavy breathing) (slow paced music) He was dark and handsome. And he's dead and gone. In helping me, she lost him. - Don't you think it odd that a bag of yours would be found at the scene of the tragedy, Miss Kilworth? - I may have left it at the concert. Charles Ormond must have picked it up to return it to me. - If you were not in fact with Mr. Ormond on the night of his death and you did not return with Miss Ormond to her room, are you prepared to tell us where you were the night of November 5th, 1912? - I became ill at the Guy Fawkes celebration. I told you that's why Karl Hess assisted me. - I see. You have a child, Miss Kilworth. - Yes. - An infant boy. What's his name? - Charles Kilworth. - Charles Kilworth. Hm. Doesn't it seem curious your son might be named after the victim himself? - It's an unfortunate coincidence. - Of course Charles is the Anglicized version of the German name Karl isn't it? Where did Karl Hess take you that night? - I had a convulsion. I was unconscious. I woke up on his houseboat the next day. - Instead of a hospital? Or a doctor's surgery? Your rescuer took you unconscious to his houseboat? Let me appeal to the jury. One witness is an unscrupulous Hun, potentially an agent of the German government. The only other witness is a woman of self-admitted easy reputation with no recollection of the events past midnight. For all this jury knows, you and Miss Ormond have colluded with a terrorist officer from the Imperial German Army, feigning an illness as an alibi for Cadet Hess to have murdered Mr. Ormond. Mr. Ormond's motor car was then set afire deliberately to destroy the evidence of this crime against one of Britain's most illustrious athletes. - He came to England only to study. - To study our society, you mean and to commit terrorist acts. - No! - Like all good spies, Cadet Hess has successfully brainwashed his victims. Mr. Ormond's death was no accident. Of this, Mr. Coroner, the jury should have no doubt how Mr. Ormond met his death or by whose hand! - In a horrible twist of fate, they pressed charges against Karl, on even less evidence than they had against me. In those stressful months before the Great War, a German scratching his ear could have started a political powder keg. Lily's lack of credibility granted me freedom from any suspicion of my cousin's death. Charles Ormond's family was offered money. And as expected, it was accepted. (loud train whistling) No one was safe in Europe before the war. Your Uncle Franklin insisted the two of you return to Canada Charlie. Once the war broke, I stole him from her. I bribed for Karl's release and had him deported. We eloped and married in Berlin, despite of my family's outrage. Karl urged me to get away and live somewhere in the country. He worried I wouldn't survive what was coming in the city. But like everyone else, I believed the whole mess would be over in six months. I never saw him again. He died on the wrong side of the Somme two years after our wedding day. I hated him for deserting me and for a long time I hated Lily for having his child. - And since he could never provide for you, I did. My money sent you to school and looked after you and your mother, all your lives. (melancholy music) (children laughing) Hello. - Hello. Did Mr. Browning send you? I've been waiting for him for an hour. - We've been all over the city trying to hunt you down. - Don't be cross with me. Mr. Browning hasn't finished his masterpiece. "Sonnet the Portuguese" I'm Dying of consumption. - I believe I warned you to quit this act 30 years ago. I'm in trouble again. It's Eleanor? Darling? It's Eleanor. - What sort of trouble? - I'm trying to find a husband or a lover or someone, anyone, to share my life with. I need you back, Lily darling. - I suppose there are certain things a chappie shouldn't pretend should she? (laughing) - Like pretending to be a corpse? - I'm not going to cover for you anymore. I can't afford to get in trouble with the law. - Let's go home now. Come on. It's alright. (upbeat music) (laughing) - Where's Lily? - Don't worry about her. She's with Eleanor. See, things are turning around. - No. Lily's life is never that easy. - Charlie? - Huh? - Come here. I want to show you something. Come here for a sec. Just come here. Alright? - Hey. - I love you, Charlie. You're a good man. You're safe with me. I want you. I want your children. (moaning) I want, don't stop. - I can't. It's not you. - Charlie, I want to be your family. Let me be your family. - Alex, Alex. You've no idea. It would break your heart. - You are like my own flesh and blood El. No one has ever been this kind to me. I know who you are. (loud wind blowing) (honking) - [Eleanor] Stop right there. I have been advised by my lawyer I can appeal on this woman's behalf. - Where are you taking her? I'm her son. - She's Dr. Warren's patient now. Family permission has been granted to move her - She needs - to the Whitby Asylum. - around the clock care. She can't go off to some. - [Narrator] This woman had severe internal injuries. - [Eleanor] Well her own son can determine - [Narrator] She will probably never recover. - Charlie. - Maybe it's time. - What? Maybe it's time? Charlie, whatever else she is she's your mother! Family! It's life! You make me so sick, Charlie. - Charlie? Come back here. I need your help. (upbeat music) - [Charlie] I tried to go back and sort out my old life. But there was nothing there. We get what we are given, and what we are given is all we have. I figured, I had to get the hell out. Like thousands of others. - Ah come on, asshole! - Charlie! Charlie Kilworth come on over here! Charlie. There's somebody I want to introduce you to. Charlie. Charlie I want you to meet Herb Koffman. He's producing Sweet Galamide on Broadway. - How do you do? - Pleasure. - This is Sophie, Mr. and Mrs. Epstein. Charlie's turned this hotel upside down, discovering new talent all summer long. - [Narrator] Hey! - He'll let you in on any raw talent we're cultivating up here in the backwoods. - I'm looking for guys like you in my New York office. - I'd appreciate sitting down with you at some point. - Jesus Christ! - If you'll excuse me - [Charlie] for a moment. - Shithole! (thudding) - Can someone get me a chair? Charlie Kilworth? Little Charlie Kilworth. It's Ada honey! How's your ma, she still behind bars? Comeone, give me a chair somebody. - Excuse me sir I need to change my jacket. - [Ada] I'm Neddy's mom. (solemn music) Too good for me you slimy bastard! - [Narrator] God damn it! - Next week by the power of attorney this entire institution may belong to me. Take it up with the board, why don't you? Finally, the prodigal son. I was worried you'd retired to the bottom of the well, dear boy. I've held that kook doctor at bay with lawyers. Hello. Massive donation to this bureaucratic pile of bricks. Lily's head is, hello, just fine now. I'm taking her to England next week. - Well, I can't stay here any longer. I'm going overseas. I'm enlisting. - [Eleanor] That's all very wonderful, Charlie. But Lily needs you too. - Yeah, well that's where you come in, Mrs. Hess. Mom? You remember Ada Harrison? - Hm. - Ada. She came by the resort I worked at last week. - Oh, Neddy, showed up the other day too. He went missing, just like Lizzie. I keep telling your little girl, please, just wait, he's coming. Pass it on. - Look, mom. There's something I have to do. I'm going to be out of the country for a bit and Mrs. Hess is going to get you out of here, right? I'm not coming back for a while. I cannot be responsible anymore. - Excuse me. - It's easy for you. You're loaded. You've got all the time to deal with, this craziness I've got nothin' more to give. - And you never will. I have looked after you all your life. - Yeah, well I understand why now. Thanks. But I can't afford to buy into anymore of this garbage about passing things on. The Wyatts and the Kilworths are dead. I'm alive. I'm alive. - You listen to me. You listen to this. She keeps asking for you to get those journals. They're some uncle's old journals that are at the farm. You're to get them before we leave. Charlie? She truly believes that you are the only one who can set things free. - How can you even think of moving her? She's dying! Just leave her here. Alright? If I go to the farm. It's not because I figure I'm cursed. I don't believe in any of this insanity about uncle Fagen, alright? Maybe you were waiting for him in a field or maybe you should never have been my mother. But I promised I'd never disown you, so, so if I find the stupid, goddamn journals, I'm doing it for you. Alright? Not to pass anything on. I'm doing it because you're you and I'm me. And, you're safe, mom. Alright, you're safe. - Goodbye, Charlie. (slow paced music) - There's nothing more important than destroying the journals now I know they exist. At the very heart of the house in the field. Oh find them Charlie, please. - Just wait he's coming in the attic of the house we lived in, in Dublin. John Fagan created a blazing fire in that attic that consumed both himself and my grandparents too. In his madness he laid a curse on all of us. (ominous music) - Hello? Grandmother? (loud gasping) You're selling this place too? - The upkeep is too much. - Too many expenses looking after Lily I suppose. What about the field? Tom Wyatt. Where will you go? - Somewhere with no memories. (slow paced music) What are you looking for? - [Charlie] I'm looking for Fagan's journals. - [Ede] Then go to the devil himself. - Mrs. Hess, telephone call. - Oh. Thank you. - Everything in this house is who we are. Hundreds of years of our family history up here. - [Ede] John Fagan was no historian. It's a punishment from God that's been passed on from my children to you. My mother should've destroyed them years ago. There's nothing left of this family. (ominous music) (shattering) Oh no! Oh my God! Oh Charlie! Charlie! - [Charlie] Hurry up! This place is going to go up like a tinder box. - [Eleanor] Charlie! Charlie! Help me. (ominous music) (light music) (loud crackling) (light slow music) - [Lily] They only wanted to help me, Charlie. They wanted me to get to that one safe place. The time will come when everyone will be brought together in one safe place. Right now I see the circles. Lizzie, Neddy, Karl and Tom. I hear that language, Charlie, we both knew once. Way off in a cave, the singing. Don't be afraid. Your life is your own now. Sing, Charlie. Pass it on. (upbeat music) - Thank you, thank you so much. (applauding) (upbeat music) What are you doing here? - Got any room on the card? (loud explosions) - [Alex] Thinking about all our old wars, I was afraid to tell you I was pregnant. It must've happened during your leave. We have a little girl, part of both of us, forever. I wish this goddamn war would end. Come back to me Charlie. I don't know what I'll do if you don't. I love you so much. P.S. her name is Emma, I hope that's okay with you. (slow paced music) - [Narrator] Hey, dad, look what I found. - [Charlie] Hey, Emma. - [Emma] I want my mommy. - Yup, she's right over there. - I want to give this to her. - So what do you think? It'll be a lot of work. - Hm. - Hey, Dad, look what I found. I need you to come and see what I'm doing. What do you think it is? Come here, it looks like a book. It's a nice picture. (ominous music) Mommy, come and see what I found. - [Lily] You were always there, Charlie, just the way I was always there myself and all of us, long before the visible parts of our lives began. Listen, the whole world is singing. Sing, Charlie. Sing. Pass it on. (slow paced music) (slow paced music) (slow paced music)
