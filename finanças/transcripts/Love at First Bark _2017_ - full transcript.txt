I am centered and focused. Nothing can take away my shine. Right. I hope you can see it. I put blue tape where I want it. Glad you're not particular. Come on, I'm not that particular. Oh, please. You're a designer. So are you, as of today. That is correct. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Come here. So now, when you're creating... that's what you'll see. You're kidding me! I can see the Astoria Tower. Our first project together. That, right there, is why I left Baluster Bay to join you. Oh, really? 'Cause I thought it was because our boss closed shop so he could retire. So there was that, too, and the promotion, but mostly, it was your vision. Yeah, I just hope it pans out, though, because, so far, that good old meditation app you recommended is not helping my nerves. You just have to give it a little bit more time, and stop worrying. It is going to be amazing. Julia Galvins Design is going to be huge. What if it isn't? I mean... what if-- what if you came here for nothing? I'm just... Really great at what you do, and everyone knows it, and that's why you didn't take another job, and why I decided to take this one with you. It's day one. You've already landed a pitch. You're right. I just need to stay focused, and everything will to be fine, right? Right. So... does this mean we're open for business? Almost. I just need to pick out my belated birthday present to myself, and then our office will be complete. You're clearly in denial. We need more space. Even our wall knows it. We don't need more space. We just... may have to consider a collage of all our graduates. How's a collage going to get us more storage? More yard space? Another room? If we think big... You're starting to sound like Bridget. Hey! Hey! Who's your best friend? You know you are. That's right, so don't you dare compare me to the girl who broke your heart. She's the one who insisted we needed to franchise. I'm just saying that we could... You're messing with me, aren't you? 13 years, and I can still pull one over on you. Only because you studied Behavioral Science, and you know my patterns now. Which is why I think we should focus on what really matters. A new filing system? No. Working with these guys. Mm? Hey, what up? : Welcome to Love at First Bark's annual adoption fair. I don't know how I'm supposed to choose one. They're all so adorable. Well, let's start with the size. What kind of dog are you looking for? Uh, I work from home, so an office dog. Right, something with a more mild temperament. Do you have any experience with dogs? Actual experience? Uh, no. I've always wanted one since I was a little girl, so does that count? It depends on why you didn't get one. Oh, my parents were surgeons in the military, so we were always on the move. Wasn't really the best setup for a dog. Well, it sounds like you have the perfect setup now. Yeah. Oh! Hi! King? Oh, wow. That's a very regal name. He's been with us for a while. He's sweet, but strong-willed. Just hasn't really connected with anyone yet. It looks like he likes you, though. Yeah, looks like it. Well, my name is Julia. No royal connection, but people say I'm pretty nice, so there's that. You know, they say a dog chooses his owner. I think King just chose you. Did you just choose me? Oh, I think that's a yes. : Heel... heel! Good girl. Don't worry, King. I won't make you walk like that. Oh, you have a question about walking? No, no, no. I was just telling King... Owen! We've got a question over here. Heel. No, no, I... Sorry, I, I... I didn't. I don't have any questions, but thank you... Owen. : Owen is our amazing dog trainer, and Julia here is looking to adopt. Am I right? Yes, if King will have me. Wow, congratulations to you both, and if you do have a question... Wow, you train rescue and therapy dogs? Well, sometimes, they're the same thing. Owen gives complimentary training sessions for first-time adoptees, just to help them with the transition. That's sweet, thanks, but I don't think we're going to need it. Well, if you do... I have to be honest... I've read a few of the books, and they all just seem a little too rigid for me. I already decided I'm going to go with a "love is all you need" approach. That's not a technique... and it's not. I'm sorry? It's not all you need. You need to set boundaries, establish guidelines. Yeah, but... there's also a lot more to relationships than just giving orders, so... You're right. You need to set a schedule. You know what? Right now, I think I really just want to buy him a really cute bed. Great. We don't have to agree on everything now, but we do like to go the extra mile to make sure you're both happy in your new home together, so we'll follow up with a home visit in a few days. Great. Good. Okay! Come in. What're you doing, King? Come on. Just a few more steps, buddy. You a little nervous? It's okay. You're home now. Come on. Okay, just... come on. Just a few more steps. Yeah, there we go. Okay. Okay. All right, buddy. Look... I know change is tough, all right? I can relate, but we're home now, okay? Ooh, ooh! Hold that thought. Okay. Hello? Yes, hi, Mr. Salas. It's so great to hear from you, yeah. We'll just make it 10:00 instead. Okay, wonderful. See you tomorrow. Okay. All right, sorry about that, buddy. Um... So, do you want a tour? It's kind of a short one, but, um... come on, follow me. Uh, this is my new office. Or I can just follow you. That works, too. Ah, here we go. I got this nice new bed. It's Velveteen. You can sleep here tonight, if you want. I've got to go to work. Enjoy your new bed. Right... I know it's late, King. But I've got a big pitch tomorrow. You want to come up here? No? It's goose down. You more of a duck fan? Maybe tomorrow, huh? Okay. Are you sure you do not mind taking him? I just don't want to leave him alone. Are you kidding me? The fastest way to get help anywhere is to bring a really cute dog. I'll get us our swatches in no time. Okay, and I will call you the second that I'm done. Don't worry about us. Just worry about Wyatt Salas. Please, I'm not worried. I'm... confident and shining and something else very spiritual. "Perfect just the way you are?" Yeah, that sounds vaguely familiar. Good... 'cause today could kind of be a game changer. We're just pitching one restaurant. Yeah, but Wyatt Salas owns 20, so you know what that means. Are you trying to make me feel better or worse? Right. You're going to kill it. So go. Okay. All right, King, wish me luck. Oh! Aw... I'll take that as good luck. All right. 'Kay. You're right, the restaurant business is brutal. That's why I usually work with established firms on my buildings, especially on something as crucial as a restaurant relaunch. Yes, and I appreciate you giving us a shot. Well, you were always one of my favorites at Baluster Bay... but honestly, you think you can handle this project on your own? Oh, it's not just me. There's also my junior designer, Sherry McRay, and if I was your favorite, you will be in great hands. One of my favorites. Right. Well, I realize we may not be what you're used to scale wise, but we will give you everything we've got. Well, you've got two people. Two very talented people with no one else to focus on... yet. We can handle it. "Two very talented people." Ugh. That didn't sound desperate at all. You know what? No. I'm not going to doom us. It started off good, and then... I should've just said you were a new hire. It would've made us sound bigger. You hungry? Oh, okay. Do you want a treat? All right. We've got salmon... or peanut butter. You pick. Okay, peanut butter it is. All right. Here you go, King. Really? Whatever you do, please look happy. Please, please. Hi! Sorry. You're not Molly. No. Why, did they tell you that she was coming? Uh... they didn't say she wasn't, so I guess I just kind of assumed. Sorry, Stuck with me. Can I come in? Yes. Yes, come on in. Hey, buddy! How are you, King? So, how's it going? Oh, you know. Work's been kind of crazy, but that's to be expected with a new business, so... I meant with King. Right. Of course. Uh... It's going well... I mean, pretty well. Pretty well? Yeah, yeah. Well enough. We're just kind of warming up to each other. So what's your routine? I'm sorry? When do you get up? Eat? Walk? Play? It's all just kind of in there. In where? Are you always this inquisitive? I'm just trying to get the full picture here. Which I appreciate, but I'm not going to force all this structure on him. Like I said, I'm going with an all love approach. Is it working? Mostly. Well, you do look pretty happy. Told you. You're good? You don't need any help? You mean with training? No. Mm-mm. You feel in control? Totally. Okay. Great. All right. I'll just head... Uh, sorry. Can I, um... Can I just give you a quick tip? Oh, is this my free lesson? Make him sit for it. What? The treat. King's a pleaser, but he's also spirited. He needs to feel like he's earned it. That's the only way he's going to know the order of things in his new home. Just try this. Sit. Good boy. Have a nice night. Work for treats? You don't need to work for treats. Do you? Okay, but just for fun. Sit. What am I doing wrong? Sit? Do you want the salmon? Okay. Hey, why are you so worried? You said that the meeting went great. I didn't say great. I said good, and I don't even know how good it went considering he hasn't called me yet. But maybe that's because you're strangling your phone. You're right. I'm going to call him. Good. : Hello? Hello, Mr. Salas? It's Julia Galvins calling. I was just about to call you. I was sensing that. Uh, see? We're already in sync. I really enjoyed your pitch... That is great to hear because I've been thinking about your space, nonstop. But I'm going to have to go in another direction. Oh. I actually feel I was prepared to lead this project, but thank you for letting us know. Bye. I'm sorry I couldn't close the deal. You know what? I think it's actually good luck not to book your first pitch. Really? I still get benefits, right? I don't know what I was thinking, King. I can't compete. I mean, I get it. I'd probably hire a more established company, too. I just... just thought, with our history, you know, but... Come on, King. Throw me a bone. Bad pun. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Okay, please. If I don't make it to the dry cleaners in the next 10 minutes, I'm going to have nothing to wear, and I'm pretty sure that's not going to help my cause, so... come on. Please? Who's walking who? Thank you, sir. That's very helpful. I feel much better now. Can I give your dog a treat? Yeah, it's real hit or miss, but sure. Yeah, you can try. Sit. Stay. Now shake. Oh, no, he doesn't shake... Good boy! Seriously? Up! I'm just curious how much your commercial space runs for, roughly? I'm thinking for the right price, my partner might actually consider moving. I'm sorry, it's how much? Um, yeah, uh... okay, Mom! All right. Bye. Hi. Hey! Maybe just one session couldn't hurt, but... I still want to lead with love. Uh, yeah. I'll try to work that into the schedule. 'Kay. So, are you looking for an express package, or something more in-depth? Uh... I'm not really sure. I think she's just looking for a few tips. Am I right? That would be great, yes. Well, he only has about 30 minutes before our lunch meeting... Perfect. Yeah, sure. We can do a quick assessment, see where you're at, and we'll go from there. Where I'm at, like, mentally? 'Cause this is probably not the best week to ask. No, I, um... meant with the dog. Just simple commands. Sit, stay... come. Yes. Yes, you're comfortable with them? Comfy-ish. Great. Let's see them. Okay. So... Right. So... Sit. Sit? Sit! Okay, let's keep going. Right. Here goes... Stay. You actually have to walk away. Why? Well, it's the only way to gauge if the dog's actually listening to you, or if he's just staying put because that's where he is. Simple, one-word phrases. I'll try. That was two words. Stay. Stay... You have to go where he can't see you, just where he hears your voice. Well, that sounds like a trick, but... I'll do it. Stay. Okay, come! Hi! Yeah, nice try. Doesn't count, does it? Not so much. Don't worry about it. We can work on this more in-depth on Saturday. Until then, just keep the commands simple. Sit. Stay. Come. Easy. Done. Are those your simple commands? I'm here all night. All right, well, until Saturday... and remember, you're the alpha. Right. Maybe I'll take a quick peek at the express package. Sure. I might still be in my sweats, but I'm going to turn this ship around. Who's next? Atta girl. Just make sure that there's something left for me to do when I get back. Oh, hey, remember, all we need to do is fill the sample book, not overload it. Whatever gets us business. Right. Okay. Breathe in. Breathe out. Something about a river and a wave. It only takes one, right, King? You've reached 555-2825. Please leave a message. Hi. This is Julia Galvins. Uh, we met last year. I was on the design team for the Margowsky Library renovations. What? We just went out. I... I was calling to let you know that I started my own design studio, Julia Galvins Designs, so if you need anything, please... What? Sit. Sit! Shh! Better yet, why don't I just call you back? Okay, that barking right there was not okay. What's up, King, huh? Do you want to shake? No? What's going on? You want to go outside? All right, fine. Grab your keys. Let's go. This what you needed, boy? Huh? Okay, King. You can run now, play. You can show off that new fancy collar. Aren't you adorable? Hi! I hope she's not bothering you. No, no, not at all. She's a charmer. King's just a little shy. I don't know. It might be his new collar. Do you think it looks too much like a necklace? I think it's perfect. - Yeah. - And don't worry. Ginger's a social butterfly. She'll make him her new best friend in minutes. Oop! There they go. Yeah. I hope I look that good in my third trimester. You're expecting puppies? Sorry, she's expecting puppies? You're clearly expecting babies, or a baby. One baby. Ginger's actually due in four weeks, and I have three months to go. But I work from home, so I can just, you know, relax into it. And wear sweat pants all day. Sweats? Sorry, or not. I, uh, I just recently started working from home, so it feels like a perk to me. What do you do from home? I'm an interior designer. I actually used to work for Baluster Bay, but I recently just started my own design studio, and yeah, it's been fun, but I'm clearly projecting my own personal style onto my dog. I'm Julia Galvins. Oh, Cassie Guggenheim. So nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. This may be a little bit small scale, but my husband and I are actually looking for a designer for the nursery. Oh, my gosh! I love nurseries. You do? Yes, yes, I love babies. I'm definitely a baby person. In fact, a lot of my best friends are... babies? Why don't I send you some photos of the space, and we'll just go from there? Sound good? It sounds like I should go to the dog park more often. Here's my card. Perfect. I'll call your office, and I'll set up a time. Great! Great. Okay, sweetie, let's go get you some treats. Time to get pampered. It was nice to meet you. I hope to hear from you. You bet. Was this all part of your master plan? If it was, thanks. Any ideas for a nursery, King? What about, like, a magical forest, or... What's up? You sleepy? Do you want to come up here? Still no? Okay. Just close your eyes, buddy. Do you want me to close my eyes first? Okay. How's that? Don't worry. We're going to figure this out. I promise. I know it's only a four-week course, but I thought we'd be a little bit more hands on, down and dirty. That's why I wore this. Well, every owner and dog is different, so every session will be different. I just don't understand how shopping's going to help. He won't sleep. I mean he slept a little, but... it's like he just can't relax. That's why we're here. But I already bought him a bed. So much of this is about how you feel. Well, I feel pretty ready to work. Great. Well... let's start by putting this... in your basket. You want me to buy a fanny pack? That's a treat trainer. It's a fanny pack. I will put it back in the basket, but I'm not convinced. Okay. Let's pick a toy. Which one? Well, which one do you think he'd like? I don't even know what kind of treats he likes best yet. I think you're putting a bit too much pressure on this. Just pick any toy. Okay... this one looks fun. All right. Classic choice... and I'll pick this one. Now, why don't you jog all the way down to the end of the aisle. Sit. Stay. All right. Now... put your toy up in the air... Okay. And shake. Ah! He likes the squirrel! Let's trade. Good boy. Sit. Sit! And stay. All right. Let's do it again. Lift your toy in the air... and shake! Okay, so... now he likes the dragon? What's the constant here? He definitely wants a toy. He wants whatever toy you have because you're the one playing with him. Look, I know you want to lead with love, but if you lead with confidence, everything else is just going to fall into place, and he's going to choose you every time. All right, well, then I'm going to get him the squirrel and the dragon, because if he loves me so much, he deserves to be spoiled... but, uh... look, do I really need to get this? Do you want to be the alpha, or not? You checked the wood samples? 'Cause I just want to make sure she understands the texture that we're going for. Done. Checked. I am leading with confidence. Yeah, is that another gem from the meditation app? Or your cute trainer? What? I don't have a cute trainer. Okay, sure, you don't. King does. I saw his card. Okay, for starters, he's not cute. He's just... in shape, and even if he was, I wouldn't notice, because what do I always say? Cookie batter is real food? And... career before love, you're in the clear. Love before career, you're just distracted. I'm not really sure that that is how that saying goes, but I do like your focus. How do I look? Not at all intimidated by Cassie. That's because I'm ignoring the Internet, unlike you. Yeah, that doesn't change the fact that she is a major philanthropist who sits on the board of practically every nonprofit in Portland. She was lovely. Still, her connections are kind of everything. Okay, you know what? I'm going to stop asking you questions. All right, King. Sit. Good boy. See? Look at all that confidence. Beautiful. Hey, Julia? Yeah? I would take off the fanny pack first. Oh, my gosh. So, are you ready to wow us? Absolutely. Here we go. One of the most important things to foster in a child is imagination. That's why I want to turn your nursery into a magical forest to engage your child's sense of wonder. Imagine your child waking up, being surrounded by trees. Three of the walls will have delicate murals depicting a tranquil forest. I love that. Mm... and what about the fourth wall? It'll be a bookcase for your child's favorite books... stories that will transport her to fantastical places, and we'll use various branches and textiles to bring it all together in an organic way. Here, feel these, for example. Oh, I don't know about you, but I really love this. : It does sound pretty impressive. Oh, I'm so glad. I have to admit, 'cause I was just a little bit nervous... But I don't like to make any decisions on the spot. Right, hon'? You don't. He doesn't. Yeah, no, I... I totally understand. Um... I mean, it's a very big decision, and I'm new, we're new, so... so there's that. Well, great. We'll look it all over tonight, and get back to you, but it's all great. No rush. No rush at all. Still nothing. Great. Come on. Hi. This is Julia Galvins. I was calling to see if you got my message. If you need any design work, please call us back, 'cause we are here for you. Anything from Cassie? Not since you last asked 10 minutes ago. I mean... dogs can't talk, so you've got to be pretty intuitive, right? As a trainer? I try to be, yeah. So then, do you think it's a bad sign? Do I think what's a bad sign? Ah, make him sit before we cross. Okay, King, sit. Good boy. That she hasn't called. It's been, like, 43 hours. Well, that depends. On what? If you're counting the seconds. Wait, are you trying to be funny? That was a bad joke. No, no. Look, normally, I would love them, but I'm just... I'm feeling a little stressed right now. You know, it's not just me, it's Sherry, too, and I don't... I don't want to let her down. I don't think you will. Okay. Um... let's, uh, let's head back. I thought we were walking all the way to the park? No, I... I don't think we need to. You're looking solid. Okay. Look, I just... I just think she would've called by now if it was good news, you know? You know what? Hand me your phone. What? After today, we only have two more sessions left, so if you're going to get your money's worth, I need your full focus. I am totally... not focused. Come on. All right. I want to work on communication. Actually, King's getting pretty good at the whole "sit" thing. No, your communication. We need to work on your voice. We do? Yeah, it's... sweet and soft, and you have this quirky little twang that I kind of like. Thank you. But it's ineffective. Oh. A command should be, as its name implies... commanding. You should be clear, firm, authoritative. It doesn't have to be hard or angry, just... committed. Okay. Exactly. The more commanding you are, the more successful you'll be. Well, I, uh... I don't feel real successful right now, in general. Well, maybe that's the problem. If you don't feel like you're in control. He certainly won't think you are. Now, I want you to give this to King... and I want you to pull on the other end and say "Give!" Here. Give. Give! : If you say his name strongly, to get his attention, and then say the command. Yeah, I don't want him to think I'm mad at him. He won't. Dogs are very perceptive. They know how you're feeling based on your body language. Your voice is used to tell them what it is you want them to do. Okay. Fine. King, here. King, give! Ah! - Huh? - It worked. Okay. Give him some praise. Ooh, who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Now, praise should always be happy, upbeat, assuring. Basically, your natural voice. Definitely better at that part. I think you're better at most things than you think. Hey, you should come with us to lunch. Who, you and Cindy? Yeah, I mean, it's dog friendly. I think it'll help get your mind off of things. Well, thanks for the invite, but I don't want to crash your lunch date. I have been the third wheel plenty of times. Oh, don't worry, her husband's already doing that. I'm sorry, I didn't know. You guys just... you guys seem so close. That's because we've been friends since college. So, what do you say? Will there be four wheels at lunch? Yeah. : You know, talk about routine. Pizza and a movie, every Friday night since our senior year in college. Even when you guys were single? Especially when we were single. Right, Owen? He's always been the organized one, even then. I'd like to say loyal to our Friday nights. Except when you bailed on us with fake laryngitis. Hey, that worked out, didn't it? What worked out? Owen pretended to be sick one Friday night so we'd hang out alone. He sensed this before we did. Thanks, buddy. Don't say I never did anything for you. Owen, that is surprisingly sentimental from you. Well, don't hold it against me. Or let him fool you. This man spends his day surrounded by cute, cuddly dogs. Underneath his love of structure... total softy. All right. Okay. Did we want to order the nachos, maybe share them? So Owen said you started your own design firm. Yeah, I... Yeah, she actually... she designed the rooftop garden at the Parker Tower. Are you serious? I worked on it at my last design firm, so not all me, but... Still, I love that space. It's so serene. Thank you. So, are we ready to order? Is someone's phone vibrating? Oh. Yeah, sorry, I have to get this. Excuse me. Hi, Cassie. So do you guys want to share the nachos, or... what? So... this is fun. She seems really nice. She's a client... Mm. And she was having a rough day, so... So you asked her to lunch? It was a friendly gesture. - Sure. - Sure. You do still remember what a date looks like, don't you? Look, just because I took a little time off doesn't mean a thing. Is two years little? Hmm, no. All right, you see this? This whole thing? You can't do it two-against-one. Hey, you're the one who set us up. Sorry, I think I have to go. Why, what happened? You get the job? Uh, she said she's looking at other designers, so... Oh. Sorry. No, don't be. It's totally normal. To be expected, actually, but... thank you for this. I had fun, and, um... it was nice to meet you. Come on. What about the buffalo wings? We could get both and share. : Mm, yeah. Tangy or hot? What... is... that? Oh, okay. All right, all right, buddy. I'm up. Thank you. Whoa. Hey, come on. We were doing so good. Whoa, whoa! Come on! Slow down. Slow down, buddy. Where's the fire? Come on. Oh, that's a wrong turn of phrase. Hey, I'm so glad you're back. Yeah, well, King clearly knows I have nowhere to be because he was determined to come home. My guess is that... Your new client is here. I'm sorry, my what? Maybe I should have called first. Is it weird that I feel weird without him? I know it's only been a few weeks, but I feel like I'm missing an arm or something. Well, you could've brought King. Yeah, I know, but Sherry already claimed him, and, apparently, he's a big hit at the fabric store, and I wanted to give you my full attention. Me? Oh, I'm easy when it comes to this stuff. No... She's the one who's going to need your full attention. I feel like I'm in one of those sleep chambers. You know, the ones in Tokyo? Every time we get another box of stuff, I can feel the walls closing in on me. I don't think it's that bad. No? You see? No. Yeah, I actually love the overall space. It's, um... it's intimate. Really? Yeah, it's got that homey feeling, where, you know, it makes people feel safe, comfortable... but I'm sorry, the furniture and storage are terrible. Hey! Finally. Thank you. It's not that bad. Like this! Why do you need this bulky storage cabinet for some papers and this one photo? Oh, is this that girl...? Should I just put it back in? Or you could just get rid of it? I just think that's a bit harsh. Or appropriate. It's been two years, or 14 in dog years. Why don't I just slide it back in? Look... all I'm saying is that there's a lot you could do in here in a fairly short amount of time, and pretty inexpensively, too. That's great. So, will you take the job? No. : No? There is not enough work for you to hire me... but I'll help you out. Oh, um... No, we couldn't do that. That's just too much work. Speak for yourself. I'm a desperate woman. I will happily take your help. Look, it'll make me feel good, and I love to work, and how about this? If you love it so much, you can give us a rave review online. How's that? Yeah. Sure. So, when do you want to start, roughly? Well, I'm free now-ish, if you are? Perfect. Great. Okay, this was Cindy's favorite, and I have to agree. I love vertical storage... anything with clean lines, making sure that everything has its place. It cuts down on clutter, and... What? Come on. You don't like structure? No. No, no, no, no, this is... this is totally different. Is it? Come on, admit it. Admit what? That you and I have more in common than you think. Does that mean you're sold on the idea? Yeah. Great. Okay, so let's go into this now. Just over there. ♪ He looked at me and said ♪ ♪ "I don't want to grow older ♪ ♪ I want to stay young forever and ever" ♪ Yes! ♪ Take off your watch... ♪ Gold, green... - White? - White. And, of course, black. ♪ 'Cause we're moving on... ♪ ♪ We're moving on... ♪ I think I may just grab a blanket and sleep here tonight. So you really like it? Please. Have you seen her face? So that's a "yes." Can I get one more "yes"? Uh... I don't know what the question is. Can I buy you a drink tonight? Heh. I mean, it's the least I can do for all of your help. Yes. I've been coming here for a long time. In fact, ever since we opened Sit for It. Mm. So do you come for the beer, the pool, or the fireplace? Would you believe fireplace? Mm... no. You're right. It's the pool, but my dogs love the fireplace. Your dogs come here? Mm, well, I mean... a great place to train therapy dogs not to be distracted by loud noises. Like that. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you could say this is... it's kind of my place. Hey, the table's free. You want to play? Are you challenging me? Well, I mean... only if you can handle it. Rock, paper, scissors for who goes first. All right. One. Two. Three. Oh! You got me. I'll rack, you break. Yeah, cool. Wow. Impressive. Think I might need the head start. ♪ Sometimes I catch myself again... ♪ All right, show off. I'm just getting warmed up. ♪ It was so long ago... ♪ ♪ So long ago ♪ ♪ When you were in my world ♪ Ooh, sorry. All right, tough guy. ♪ You were the girl... ♪ All right... So am I. Okay, not bad. Lucky, but not bad. Oh, really? I wasn't expecting that. That's what you get for challenging an only child. I hope you like it, King. I guess everyone needs their place, right? Go on. Go to your new bed. I'm sorry I didn't think of this sooner. : Hello? Cassie? Hey, it's Julia. Look, I know you're looking at other designers, but I have one more idea to run by you. Thank you for meeting me. Oh, I have to admit, your little tease on the phone has me quite curious. Well, I was thinking about how amazing this magical forest would be for your baby, but realized I had forgotten one thing... a magical place for Ginger. For Ginger? And her puppies, of course. A nursery. Actually, it would be a puppery. A puppery? A puppy room. You said you wanted a special treat for Ginger, so this would be their special place. I don't know if it's the pregnancy hormones, but... I just love that. You do? I do. It's very unique. Only thing... Ginger is due in two weeks. Can you get both done in that time? Absolutely. Really? That mean we got the job? That's okay. It was a long shot. I'm really glad that you went in there swinging. It was brutal. Really? No. Eye of the tiger, baby! We got the job? We got the job! Oh! We got the job! Hey! Hey, we got the job! We got the job. What? We got the job. Breathe deeply. Quiet your mind. Nope. Still not helping, buddy. My focus comes from being centered. Breathing keeps me centered. I don't know what I like more, the fact that there are pen holders in here, or actual empty drawers. You do realize you need to get out more, right? Said by the man who refuses to date. I don't refuse. I just chose to focus on... You said it, not me. Hi. Hey. Sorry, I know our next session isn't until next Saturday, but I got the job, the Cassie job, and it's kind of because of you. Me? You talked about your place, which made me think about King, so I gave him a place, and the next you know, I'm designing a puppery! Sorry, a what? And it's not just about Cassie. It's about all the people who come with her. I'm sorry, a puppery? Do you know what that is? No, because I made it up! Okay, you're spinning out here. The nursery, I can do. The puppery, I have no idea, so that's why I'm here. So you want me to help you with... a puppery? Just kind of, like, spitball ideas, that's all. Um... Okay, I'm really, really, really open because as you know, dogs aren't really my strong suit. I mean, they are... you are, King... but just dogs in general, I don't have that much experience with them. Let's go. What? You said the first thing that came to my mind. Let's go. Okay... Come on! Bye! Bye. I don't understand what this has to do with the puppery. I just... I want you to go for it. Wait, I'm sorry, are we having a session right now? Do you trust me? Okay, so you just... want him to run? Seems a little anti-you. Well, that's why you're both going to do it together. Are you serious? You're the one that wanted to get down and dirty. - No! - Go! King! Oh, look at that! Oh, you're such a good boy. Come on, come on! Let's go! Oh, my gosh, I did not know he could run like that. How do you feel? Besides out of shape? Good, good. I don't know how that helped my training skills, though. It didn't. I'm sorry, what? It's not always about learning. It's about feeling. It's about your bond. That sounds like something I would say. Well... you're not the only one learning here... and besides, I thought it... looked like you two could use a release. It's amazing how happy you are when they're happy. That's why I feel so lucky. I get to work on this every day. Did you always know you wanted to be a trainer? I always knew that I wanted to fix things, even when I was little. So I started training therapy dogs, rescue dogs... and when I saw how they changed people's lives... I couldn't picture myself doing anything else. You know, you're pretty good at this whole dog training, reading people thing. You could open a dozen Sits for Its, and they'd all be busy. Huh. Sorry, did I say something wrong? No. No? It was just something my ex used to say. Oh, right. The poodle lady? Was it that obvious? Not on the street, no, but Cindy kind of helped drive it home with the whole photo thing. Right. Well... it's not that exciting. She thought that I should expand the business. She had a rich uncle that was willing to invest... and I liked it the way it was. Apparently, that was my "lack of ambition." Or pride in what you do. So, did you break up with her? No, she dumped me. It was pretty brutal, actually. I'm sorry. Guess you can't fix everything, right? That's a good boy. Well? How do you feel? I feel as ready as I'll ever be. That's a good place to start. Hey, um... I could come check out that space... if-- if you want. It's kind of my turn to help you out now. - Oh, hey-- - Oh-- So yeah, uh, if you want to come look at the place, um... we have time, but that would be nice. Okay. And Owen? Just for the record, I, um... I don't think there'd be space for the poodle lady on the wall anyway. You're probably right. Okay, I think we should go with mahogany. It's rich and soothing. We can oil it and get a darker hue, if you want? That sounds perfect. Let me just ask Owen about the materials for the puppery. That's a nice excuse. What? No! No, no, no. I'm not... we're not... I don't even know if he's over his ex-girlfriend or not, and besides, even if he was, I don't need the distraction. Right? Just... grab the samples, please. Hello? Hi, Cassie. Yes, is everything okay? Thank you. Hey, Cassie. Hi! Uh, on the phone, you said you needed my help? Yes, I've decided to throw a shower. Okay... and you want me to help you plan your baby shower? It's a puppy shower... actually, more of a fund-raiser for the American Humane Association... but that way, we can totally show off your work and raise money for a good cause. Great! Yeah, and you don't have to do anything to plan it, but I do need you to have everything done... by this Saturday. Okay, so... that's less than a week away. I realize it's a tad accelerated, but I really want to have this done before Ginger has her puppies, and I totally believe in you. I can handle it. You are amazing. It's going to be great. Okay, honey! We've got some planning to do. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. Here we go. Let's go. Here we go. It's Owen. Hey... I might need you sooner than I thought. : Okay, so it's right around here. Okay, so this is literally where the magic is going to happen. Hope you're talking about my amazing skills? Owen, you remember Sherry, right? My magical designer. She has to say that. She's working me to the bone. Well, it's already looking great in there. Thanks. Oh, so this is it over here? Yes. Hey, Julia? Yeah? I'm really glad he's not, you know, good-looking at all. Yeah, I told you. Keep your focus, lady! Laser! So I was planning on dividing the room into a feeding, sleeping, and play area. Mm. Yeah, no, I like it. You're just going to want to make sure you give Ginger a place to interact with her puppies and rest on her own. Okay. I also wanted a doggy door to the deck, but Cassie's hesitant to cut into the wall because she doesn't want a draft. Well, you know, they make electronic doors now. The dogs wear a chip on their collar and the door opens and closes automatically as they approach. I would imagine that would cut the draft. And that is why they pay you the big bucks. Sorry, nervous tick. If you work as quickly in here as you did in there, you'll be done ahead of schedule. I'm not so sure about that. Cassie, this is Owen. Oh, are you part of Julia's design team? No, not really. I train Julia's dog. Owen understands dogs better than anyone, so I wanted to consult with him to make sure we didn't miss anything. I love it. So do you know about our little fundraiser for the American Humane Association Shelter to Service Program? I've worked with them before. It's a great program. What do they do? It's an extensive process, but it's all about training shelter dogs to work with veterans in need. It's some of the most rewarding work I've ever done. Well, I hope you can join us, and don't be scared of the whole "shower" thing. There'll be lots of other guys there and plenty of food. Are you all set? Yeah. I'm great, thank you. Okay, I'll leave you to it. Okay. Wow. You sound very relaxed. I feel very relaxed. Let's get to work! Come on! I want this room cleared, right now. So grab that chair. All right. Geez. I thought I was a task master. What? Come on. Can you grab this chair? Okay, one, two, three. Perfect. Okay, King. Sit. Shake. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Okay! Good boy! Ready? Come on! Ta-dah! Wow! That... is fantastic. Thank you. To the best team and first project a girl could ask for. Thank you. I will cheers to that. Ditto. I cannot believe that the shower is tomorrow. I can't believe all the people that are going to be there. That list is crazy. And really fancy. Yeah, which is why I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight, or eat. You should be very proud. They're going to be impressed, I promise. Well, luckily, you'll be there to tell them that. All right, do you guys want to order? It's on me, so please load up. Actually, I can't stay. It's Friday night. Oh, right. I forgot. What's Friday night? Owen's standing date with his best friends. If it wasn't such a tradition... No, totally. We'll just, uh, we'll celebrate tomorrow. Don't even think about it. Really? Yes, totally. Okay. Bye. Great! If you're paying, I'm going to order a ton of food. You would. I was just in the area. You were just in the area with flowers? Yeah, yeah. I generally make a habit of carrying them around with me. Smart. I'm sorry I had to take off earlier, but I'd like to finish celebrating with you, if... you're free? Free, like... now free? If you can fit it into your schedule. Stop it! Are you serious? : I, uh... I thought you could use a relaxing glass of wine in the most beautiful spot in the city. This is gorgeous. You were clearly raised a gentleman. Well, my parents were married 35 years. Aw, were they high school sweethearts? Yes, they were. What about yours? Oh, no. No, mine, uh... mine have been divorced since I was in high school. Oh... sorry. No, don't be. They're actually really good friends. They just couldn't juggle career and marriage together. Is that why you put everything you have into your business? No. No, I, uh... I tried both once. It just... didn't work out. Well, that doesn't mean that it can't. I can't believe you did all this. Well, thought you might need a reminder of all ways you've made this city beautiful. What? Well, here's... Astoria Tower right there... and the Margowsky Library, and you can see the rooftop garden on the Parker Tower, and the Harris Building. All the buildings I worked on at Baluster Bay. People are going to love what you do as long as you believe in it. You're too much, you know that? Like, in a good way? Um... yeah. I can't believe how late it is. Thank you for... everything. It's a big day tomorrow. Yeah. King's graduation and a puppy shower. There's lots to be excited about. Yeah, there definitely is. Is he going to get his nose stuck in the door? No, he... No, probably not. I should, um... I should probably go. Okay. Bye. Bye. Breathing keeps me centered. Light and happy is my natural state. My light shines from within. "Would you like to permanently delete the meditation app from your phone, and all of its data?" Absolutely. Come on! : Well, he stopped sitting on my feet, so that was a good thing, and then I decided no more fancy collars. I can't imagine he was a fan. He was not, no... but other than that, things are going really well. I clearly had some help, though. See? I told you he was great. He kind of is. Hey, I know you're super busy, but any chance you want to come share your story at the adoption fair tomorrow? My story? Really? Yeah. Even the bit where I couldn't get him to sit, or sleep, or even take a treat? Especially those bits. Those are the things that show people how to be a loving dog owner, and you are definitely that. Well then, I would be honored. : You know, most of our graduation ceremonies don't have quite as much pomp and circumstance as this one. Yeah, that's what happens when you organize someone's office. I don't think that's the reason. He didn't! Okay. King? Sit. Stay. I'm here to present to you this plaque. - It's a real beauty. - Yeah. Just in case you were wondering, these are highly coveted in the art world. That's good to know. You both have shown huge progress in the last four weeks, so it's with pride... and, I'll admit it, a little sadness... that I declare King... and Julia Galvins... our newest graduates. Congratulations. Yay! Look, King! Congratulations! You're such a good boy. He did good. You too. I tried. So I'll see you tonight? Actually, I don't know. Oh, you don't know? I haven't really found a date yet. Can I pick you up at 8:00? Yeah. This is too dressy for a puppy shower, isn't it? But then again, it is a fundraiser, and a date, so... I don't know. What do you think? Well, thanks, sir. I think you're right. It's perfect. I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming! Hi. Hi. I, uh... wasn't sure what the dress code was for a puppy shower... although it's not just a puppy shower... I was right there with you. You look incredible. Thank you. So do you. Thanks. I can't believe the puppies came early, and we're just finding out. They're so adorable. Yeah, at least we know everything's working in there. Yeah, fingers crossed. Oh, wow, everyone's so fancy. Yeah. Do you know anyone here? Uh, a few, yeah, actually. Quite a few. I don't know about you guys, but I had no idea what to wear to this kind of thing. I think you nailed it. You look beautiful. Good... 'cause I can't breathe. Did you guys see those puppies? It looks like we staged them. I'm going to go up there for a little cuddle before I go and hunt down some new clients. Have fun. Well... Oh! Did he just see me? Who are you talking about? Wyatt Salas. Marine shirt. Judgmental brow. My first rejection going solo, so it still kind of... still kind of stings a little bit. Well, you should get out and say hi. Julia, this is your event. You're right. Yeah. Hi! It's more of a welcome party, isn't it? Everything is phenomenal. Thank you, and congratulations. Thank you. Have you tried the Puppy Punch? No, no, not yet. Well, you should, and also, please play some games. I know they're totally ridiculous, but what I've found is, over the years, people tend to donate more when they're having fun, so go have some fun. Okay. Okay. : Pin the Tail on the Spaniel? Seriously? She said to have fun, so come on. Okay. Sure, whatever you say. Okay. All right. Make sure you cannot see anything. It's pitch black. Okay. Ready? One... two... Okay, grab this. Okay. All right, go. Okay, wait. Let me help you out. Oh! So close! Painfully so, yeah. What, you think you can do better? Yeah. Oh, well, let's just get a tail and see... Bridget? Wow. Wha... what are you doing here? I came with my uncle. Oh, yeah, of course. Hi. So, what are you doing here? Just playing... Pin the Tail on the... Spaniel... and I helped Julia with the puppery. You must be Julia Galvins then? Yes, that is... that is me. 'Scuse me. As soon as they asked about the soundproofing, I just froze. I'm doing a horrendous job. You're going to have to explain the concept. Come! Sorry. So, uh... : Okay, so you've met Vince from the opera house, and Marlene from the wine board... Ah! What about Wyatt Salas? Oh, no, that's okay. No, no. Come here. Wyatt? I would love you to meet my brilliant designer, Julia Galvins. Julia, this is Wyatt. We've met. Hi there. I have to say, I travel with my two very spoiled Jack Russell Terriers everywhere, and I've never heard of a puppery before. So why doesn't Julia give you a little tour of the puppery? Yes. Sure. Awesome. Right this way. Great. And this is the puppery. Wow! I love the beauty of the panels, but it also provides a soundproof barrier between the puppery and the nursery, so the puppies won't disrupt the baby, and vice versa. So you thought of everything? We tried to think of everything, which is good, since... they made an early appearance. Now you get to see it in action. I'm impressed. Thank you. I think it's perfect for you. I'm glad you didn't listen to me. I'm sorry. Everything happens for a reason. I'm glad you found your reason. Julia... I think I underestimated you. What? What you've done with these rooms... it's, uh, it's incredible. It turns out I'm pulling up the next project, and I'm going to need another designer. What do you think? I... yeah, I think that sounds... great! I'm sure we can talk more about it tomorrow, but I think... I think right now, I just need some Puppy Punch, so... excuse me. Okay. Hey! How'd it go? I'm sorry? I saw you talking to "judgmental brow." How'd it go? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I don't know right now, okay? Hey, clearly, you're not okay. Wha... Does this have something to do with Bridget? The poodle owner? Yeah... she's my ex, but why are you so upset with me? You think you're the only one who can read people? What are you talking about? You know what? It's okay. I just, I should've realized it sooner. I mean, I kind of suspected it with you avoiding her. Oh, and then there was the whole photo thing, but... you're not over her. I get it. It's okay. No, there's... there's nothing to get. I saw you with her, Owen. Julia! I don't know what you think you saw, but it was nothing. I'm here with you, aren't I? I can't do this right now. This night is way too important to me. I know, but we need to talk about it. No, we don't. I told myself that I would stay focused, that I would not get distracted, that I'd focus on my career first, and then... Now look at me! I just spent the past hour worried about a girl I don't even know, and a guy I just met. Why don't we talk about it when I take you home? Actually, I'm going to... I'm going to get a ride home with Sherry. Are you serious? I just can't do this right now. Julia! You keep saying you want to lead with love for King... but you can't even do it for yourself. I'm sorry. What's up, buddy? Huh? I know, King. I'm sad, too, but it's just... less complicated this way. We just need to stay focused, okay? Hey, you want some salmon? Come on, let's go get some salmon. Come on. Well, I think we have one more free shelf. Well, that should hold us for another week, tops. I'm kidding. Oh... Bad day to joke? Mm... Yeah, maybe. Have you heard anything? No. I'm just going to stick to what I'm good at... hanging out with these guys. That's probably a good idea... and if you want, you could just move in with us. We could order pizza every night, just the three of us, until we're old and gray. You know I'd personally love that, but just so you know, you're better at this whole love thing than you think. I think... there's still space on the wall for one more. Don't give up. Well, I feel like a debutante after a coming out ball. We've already gotten two phone calls, four emails... it's not even noon. That's terrific. Good. Well then, I am going to go make us a super strong pot of coffee, because I have a feeling that today is going to be a busy one. I might need those, buddy. You got a call from someone named Molly? I couldn't quite make out the message, but it was something about a fair? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Salas. We look forward to seeing you soon. He wants us to work on his new restaurant, doesn't he? Yeah, it looks like it. I knew it! That is amazing. Do you realize how amazing that is? Yeah, I do. It is... it is. Wait, maybe I'm missing something, but... why don't you call him? You know you want to. What are you talking about? Please. We've known each other for six years. I think you know who I'm talking about. You should've seen them together. Her, actually. She was... perfect. It felt awful. I can't be distracted by a guy who isn't even over his ex, and even if he is, it's just... it's just too much right now, right? Right. I get that... but from where I was standing, he was chasing you, not her... and you did all of this with him in the picture... but you really need to feel that for yourself. I do. I mean... I did. I just... Got scared? Maybe. Well... then maybe you need to chase him back. We're good to go. You ready to tell your story? Yeah. You want to know if there was a lot of early mornings? Yes. To be honest, I had no idea just how much a dog would change my life, but he did... and it took us a while to figure each other out... what we needed, what we needed to work on... but then it just sort of clicked... and it didn't matter how much more complicated my life was because of it, because of him. All I kept thinking about was how much richer my life was for having him in it. It is the best kind of distraction. Okay, I think we'll wrap this up. Who wants to meet the other dogs? I'm not really sure that you want to see me right now, but I wanted to give you these. You wanted to bring me dog toys? I wanted to test your whole "lead with love" theory. Okay? Here. The truth is... I'm going to choose you every time, because what we have is and will always be worth fighting for. I'm sorry that I doubted you, Owen. It was just... it was just kind of a lot, and I just... I just froze. It's okay. I think we were both just working out the kinks. Should we say it was a warm-up? Yeah. Okay, King. Here. Come on! Come on.
