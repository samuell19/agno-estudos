Ms. Castro. Get in. Just returned. Ms. Castro. - First time here? - Yeah. Ah, explains why I haven't seen you before. Why did you follow me? I don't want you anymore. - We're done. - It's that simple for you? I'm in a relationship to be happy. If I'm not happy anymore, I'm done. You're done with me? Please, don't insist. It's time to move on, baby. Stella! Your test is positive. You're pregnant! That's not a problem. I'll take care of things. But if Jerry will marry you, Go. Continue with your pregnancy. Not possible. She's married. The wife is in abroad. So he can't marry you? That's on you. Your decision. Would you be happy with an illegitimate kid? - I don't want to. - Abort it. That's a sin, right? Why? A sin to whom? Your body, your rules. Decide for yourself. Why would you care about what people will think? Sin to God. Carmen, world population is almost 4 billion. God might spare you. Okay, I'll update you. Take care, cousin. Hello? Carmen? Jerry, can we meet later? We just met last night. You want more? No, this is something serious. We have to talk. Alright. I'll postpone my game. You know me. Always at your service. Okay. See you. And yours. Bye. Bye. Miss, what titles are you looking for? Gremlins and Ghostbusters. Gremlins and Ghostbusters.. It's here. But don't you want something sexier like, Like what? Like Splash? Okay, Splash.. Why are you quiet? I thought you want more? Take it off. Carmen, That's nothing. It's not the end of the world. - Let's do it. - What should we do? Is that a problem? Abort it. If you want to, we can visit a doctor tomorrow morning. Are you kidding me or just apathetic? This is our kid. Your kid. Can't we consider this unborn kid as our love child? No, no, no. Remember. No strings attached. You're forgetting it. No, Jerry. I'm just reminding you. This is not a baggage. It's your kid. What do you mean? That's not yet a kid. Baby bump. Even so! It's still a sin to.. My God, Carmen. You're in Manila. Here in Manila, it's only a sin if you can't take responsibility. We're wasting our time discussing useless stuff. Let's start. Jerry, do you love me? Of course, I do! Let's start. Then why would you tell me this is useless stuff? Carmen, Pregnancy is a string. A string. Haven't we talked about it from the start? No strings attached. Right? What now? My God.. Why did I ever love you.. Always postponing it for tomorrow. Always postponing it. That's why you're living like that. Always in debt. Asking for extension. What do you think of me, a bank for your future? This bank's closed now. Carmen. You're late again. You often come home late. Not that I'm policing you, since you're not a kid anymore, and you always pay rent in time. But I treat you like my daughter. It's for your good, too. Sorry Ms. Juling, we had to overtime. Don't be mad, that would be bad for you. Those squatters always gets me. David's in debt for a year. Now he's asking me to let another squatter stay longer. What will happen to the chapel I want to construct on the lot they occupied? They'll also benefit from it. It's for our Lord, My God. - What should I do to them, Maning? - Good evening Dr. Sison. Good evening, Carmen. He's here because we have a prayer meeting. - Can you check my blood pressure? - Let me see. We still have time, right? There are times that I feel pain in my chest. Let's check it. You're really leaving? Yes, I'm late. I just got my money converted to dollars an hour ago. You won't believe, the exchange rate on black market is 26:1! - Not ready? - What? - Where to put this fermented fish? - Why would I need that? - I'll put it here. - Okay, I'll fix that. Arrange this. He's my brother, Jun. Carmen. Jun. Will Juling get another boarder after you leave? She said no. She's done with getting headaches. She can't get along with people. Why are you leaving? My God, Carmen. What a question! Nothing's happening in my life here. So.. I have to go. Wish me luck. I'll be migrating illegally. I have to go. That's enough. - Attorney, good morning. Come in. - Good morning. - Hello. - Hello Carmen, this is Bobby! Bobby? - Where are you? - At the airport. Straight from Davao. I want to meet you later. Are you still in the same office? - Yes. - Alright, I'll pick you at 12:30. - Okay. - I'll be there at 12:30, sharp. Take note, 12:30. Noted. Bye. Lumen. My pain-killer? - Coming. - My head aches.. I thought the eviction notice for squatters will be released this week? Know what, Ms. Abedra. It's up to the government. We can't expedite it. But it's going on for three years now. Do we need to wait another three years? The case is already on court. If we want to be sure, we can probably bribe them if we want immediate action. That's easy! Why didn't you suggest it? Why don't we bribe all of them so the case can move? I'm pestered by those squatters. Your medicine. I need to make it up with Father Piedra. I've been telling him about my plans to build a chapel. No worries, I'll talk to the judge later. Thank you, attorney! - Leave it to me. We'll check it. - I hope it goes well, I'm at my limit. I'll trust you, attorney. Praise the Lord! Carmen. Anything wrong? Nothing, I'm just tired. You're not eating anything. I don't have appetite. Juling, - Here's for my rent. - Thank you. The tree's being trimmed because it blocks our view of the church. - I'll have to go. - Take care. Carmen. Carmen. Good morning, Carmen. Ms. Juling.. You saw what happened. Asking for payment when she's aware that my kid's sick. Helen's sick too. She can't sell sampaguita today. Diarrhea. Common illness today. When it comes to harm and illness, poor people like us always suffer first. But with other things, we're always on the last. I wonder why. It's like God want it for us. So I'm asking if you can lend me any amount. Just add it to my previous debt. Don't worry, I'll be on a construction site this Saturday. I'll pay you. Ms. Juling.. She's now asking us to vacate her land. She's building a chapel. We need a house, not a chapel. Here, Mr. David. Carmen! I hope you can add some more. Ms. Juling.. I'm sorry, I don't have much either. The jeep's leaving. We're leaving! Carde! Carde! Makati! Tulay! Makati! Tulay! That's the first time I saw lots of rats. Can't count them. As big as cats. The rats ravaged rice and crops on our farm. After that, they moved. And then, the locusts came. Brought terror. Everything was dark. What the rats left, the locusts feast upon. The field was empty. Nothing to harvest. So I need to talk to the bank about our loan. So we can delay the payment. I wanted to loan more. Or else, we'll have a hard time starting again. - Why are you quiet? Any problem? - Huh? Nothing. You should go with me to Davao. Let's get married. So we can have lots of kids. The best age to have kids - is between age 20 to 25. - Bobby. Let's get married before Christmas. So next month, you should resign from your work. You gain nothing from it. Remember your brother in Davao? He got it easy. The exchange rate's better now. Your parent's remittance from America, he's enjoying it! With his friends, he's always drunk. Always high. And here you are, - stressing yourself. - You haven't changed. What do you mean? Telling me what should I do. Life's hard. So you should plan things out. Carmen, what I'm telling you.. All these plans, is for your good. - For us. The problem is.. - The problem is.. You treat me like a kid. As if only you can decide for us. Carmen, I'm three years older than you. I'm a man and you're a woman. - So you should.. - I should be different. I don't want you planning my life for me. I don't want to rely on other people. Anyway. I'll be here for 2 weeks. I'll not go to Davao without the money I need from the bank.. And without you. All my life, making decision isn't hard. Only this time. It feels like whatever I do, I'll fall on a deep well. No. Push all those guys to that well. - What if I trip? - No! Protect yourself first. Prioritize what matters to you. First, you need to be happy before you can make others happy. And remember, happiness is not an accident. You have to work for it. You have to move first, then move fast. Look at me. I got bored with Cesar so I cut him off. Split! I don't want you! Get out of my life! That's it. Hello, new boyfriend. Attorney. A good kisser. Easy. I know.. But the one I love is Jerry. But once he found out I'm pregnant, - he's keeping distance. - Then marry Bobby. He'll make me an ornament on their house. You'll be a decoration? Then don't marry him. Find another guy. The problem is you're concerned with what is good, evil, and mortal sin. You should concentrate on what makes sense. There are far more bigger problems than morality. Modern life requires a compromise. Clean conscience won't do if you're starving for love, sex, and food. It's 1984. Wake up from your ideals. Stella. From Mom? I hope there's some money to pay for rent. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Still separated? There's no hope for them. Every time they meet, they argue. They're better off without each other. Alright, there's money to pay for rent. Mommy's sending me money for rent every end of the month. Daddy's giving me money for allowance every 15th. Fine by me. That's what they want. Doesn't say anything. They're checking on you. Pregnant, and still stupid. I'm looking for a new place. Move with me so I can overhaul your personality. Leave that old maiden landlord. My parents doesn't trust you so they won't allow that. Which reminds me, this job bores me. So I'll move to recruitment next week. It's time to move-on, baby. Stella. - Hi! - Hi! - We're having lunch? - Yeah! How nice. Carmen, he's Atty. Barrameda. She's my cousin, Carmen. - Hello. - Hi. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, who's this? Jerry. - Hello. - Carmen. Be prepared, I'll be there after lunch. We'll be going somewhere. Miss, I'm Jerry Grasa. I got an appointment. There's another patient. It may take up an hour. Where's the woman? There are bed bugs! I won't go back there again. Alright, just wait. I'll call you when it's your turn. Fell off! Cora, the streets are unorganized.. Last night, there are.. We'll wait for an hour. The police arrived and asked me.. Why is there a severed head there. Why ask me? You know our area. Lots of killers and thieves. Lots of jerks. Help me find a place. It's unnerving here. Every day I have no idea what awaits me outside. This life sucks. For that matter, don't take a cab. Take a jeep. A lot is happening on the streets. Just a minute so the driver left the vehicle. After that, five men took over and declared robbery. She was taken somewhere. The earrings and necklace were stolen. The dress, bag, shoes.. all of them! They only left her underwear. - For free.. - It's the same.. What you need to do is.. Hey! It's your turn now. This is our fate. The fate of the church which we have professed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Is it your wish that Roberto be baptized by the holy catholic church which we have professed with you. Yes, it is. Roberto, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit Amen. And the father of our Lord Jesus Christ has freed you from sin. Given you a new birth by water and the Holy Spirit and welcome you into his Holy People. He now anoints you with the chrism of salvation. As Christ was anointed Priest, Prophet, and King, so may you live always as a member of his body, sharing everlasting life. Amen. Please have mercy.. Have mercy, give us alms. Give us alms. Have mercy, give us alms. Carmen. Good thing you attended mass. - How are you, Bobby? - Doing fine. I'll just talk to Father. Father. Ms. Juling, how are you? Father, the chapel might be delayed again. The squatters are stubborn. - If that's the case.. - My attorney said, the eviction order may come soon so we can get rid of them. It's embarrassing. Especially to St. Martin. That was my promise to him long ago. Leave it to God. - Hello. - Hello. Overseas call for Ms. Carmen Castro from Mrs. Monita Castro from Los Angeles, California. Are you Ms. Castro? - Yes. - Go ahead, please. Hello, Carmen! Hello! Mommy.. - How's life there? - We're doing good. We're worried because we can't call you lately. How are you? Hello! Hello, Carmen? Don't cry. We'll petition you. We just need to prioritize your brother, Poldo. I heard he's being involved with a lot of bullshit. After him, we'll get you too. Have you received my letter? Hello? Hello, Carmen? - Hello? - I'm still on the line. We'll return to Philippines this coming August. 2 weeks in Davao. After that, we'll bring Poldo here. Let's meet at Davao, okay? Okay. Okay. Bye. Alright. Bye. If we're taking law into consideration, abortion is illegal. That's on our revised penal code. Articles 256 up to 259. According to article 258, the penalty of prision correccional shall be imposed upon any woman, and that's you, Carmen, if ever. Who shall.. Practice abortion upon herself, or shall consent that any other person should do so. Now article 259 states clearly the penalty for the doctor who will do the abortion. We're impressed. Right, Carmen? - We're impressed. - Let me continue, Stella. It's stated that the penalties provided shall be imposed upon any physician or midwife who shall cause an abortion or assist in an abortion. But as far as I know, abortion cases are rare. Usually, a case is filed if - the woman dies.. - No, Carmen. You won't die. You're a bad woman like me. Anyway, usually it's the woman's family who runs after the doctor. There are instances where the man is involved on the case. - But that's unlikely. - I'm sleepy. I recall a case where the doctor is penalized - but the man is freed. - Unfair! He should be in jail! - Especially he didn't force the woman. - Usually, men wants the abortion. The problem is who will testify? I will testify! The apprentices won't want to be involved. What usually happens is the doctor will ask you to sign a paper telling that you're already bleeding when you arrived. That means abortion isn't intentional. So that's not the doctor's fault. Smart. In America, abortion is legal. - Since 1973, I think. - Philippines is still in middle ages. According to their Supreme Court, a woman has a right to decide for herself. Of course! The woman and her doctor. Only up to the third month and the doctor is licensed to do so. That doesn't matter. - So what should I do? - Up to you. Your decision. So we're back to zero? Excuse me. Bobby, come here! Hi. Bobby, his boyfriend. Come in. Have a seat. I might be disturbing your discussion. No, we're just chatting. We're talking about our friend that has two boyfriends and impregnated by the married guy. They can't be married so - considering an abortion. - Have a seat. So what's the problem? Nothing. I'm just explaining the legal aspects of abortion. So what are the legal aspects of abortion? Well.. Definitely illegal. Even in Catholic church, abortion isn't allowed. I told you we're going somewhere. I called your office earlier. They told me you're here. Shall we go? - Excuse us. - Sure, go ahead. - Nice meeting you. - Before I forget, he's attorney Barrameda. Attorney Barrameda, nice meeting you. Stella, we'll have to go. So what shall we do? - Make love? - Sure! This place's good. Quiet and clean. I hate hotels in Roxas Boulevard. Lots of Japanese! I'll be here for two weeks so I picked a good one. I should be done with what I have to do next week. You're ready? For what? With what I told you recently. Three years ago, we have an agreement. Bobby. We don't have an agreement. When we're in college, you told me your plans. Your wants, and what should happen to us. But I didn't respond. - I didn't agree. - But you didn't disagree either. Carmen. What else do you want? We're childhood friends. Our parents are friends. They have agreed. We're a couple since high school. Everyone knows it! They know that we'll eventually get married. That should happen! Bobby. Bobby. There are lots of things that I haven't done yet. My Mom will bring me to America. The friend we were talking about earlier still has a problem. I don't want to leave her yet. My God, that's nothing. She should just give birth. No-brainer. If her other boyfriend really loves her, he'll still marry her. Even if he's not the father. So she won't be humiliated. If the guy really loves her. But if not.. She's doomed. Let's talk about us. Will you go with me to Davao? Or not? - Bobby, I don't want to live there. - What do you mean with that? You're born in Davao. You grew up there. - We met in Davao. - Bobby.. If we'll settle down, I don't want to live in Davao. - I want it here.. - That's not in my plan! You don't love me anymore. Do you love me? Or you love me because you should? Because I'm part of your life's plan? You treat me like a project. Included on your blueprint. Included on your to-do list. Included on things that you should do and should have. You've changed. Isn't that expected? No. Because I don't. I haven't changed. Change.. Love.. I'm looking at you, 2,000. Plus another.. Five. What's mine? 7,000. Hello? Hello, can I talk to Jerry? - Who's this? - Carmen. Please wait. This one. You're sure with your card.. Okay, this 2.. Guys, excuse. Okay. Wait me, I'll just answer the phone. - Going out? - No, I'm still in. - Know what.. - Berting.. Buy and sell is a good business. We'll be earning dollars. Hello, - Hello, Jerry. - Carmen. I'm losing. What do you need? Jerry, I already thought about it. I want you to decide. Tell me what you want and I'll do it. - Just don't.. - Carmen. You know I don't like making decisions. But you're involved here! Why don't you pick a card to decide? What? Do a toss coin instead. Jerry, this is not a game. My life's at stake here. Our kid's life. Carmen, that's not yet a kid! I told you that's just a baby bump! Carmen. Life's a game. Now, if you can't decide because your guilt will haunt you.. Then do a toss coin. Whatever the coin shows, just think that it's what God wants you to do. He's the God anyway. Whatever He wants you to do, He'll control the coin to show you His decision. Use a 25 cents coin. Toss it. If Juan Luna faces up, get an abortion. If the butterfly faces up, then continue with your pregnancy. It's simple, right? Okay? Alright. Bye. Fuck you! You have disagreement with Bobby? You're lucky to have him. He's responsible. Know what, if someone like him asked me out when I was young, then I would have married. When will you be married? Juling, I'm pregnant! More reason for you to get married. Bobby's not the father. Then who? Jerry's the father. The gambler? Yes. Then marry him instead. He has a wife already. What are you planning? I don't know! You need to give birth! Even without a father? Jesus Christ will be the father. Is there no other option? That's the only option. How about abortion? You can't do that! I won't let you! You've already sinned, don't commit another one. What's the sin that I have committed? Committing adultery is a sin! Killing your child is another sin! That's a life! What should I do? My parents will humiliate me once they found out! What matters to you? That humiliation or committing a sin? Stella told me that there are lots of women who have undergone abortion. Your cousin know nothing. Have she aborted a baby? She has no idea what a woman feels when undergoing abortion. The feeling of regret. The guilt from committing a sin? We're a woman, Carmen. We're born to raise and nurture a child. Not to kill one. I know what I'm talking. I'll never forgive you if you'll kill that baby. God will not forgive you. Maning. Did I wake you? I can't sleep. Flashbacks.. I already took Valium. It's just.. The flashbacks are.. What can I do? It's haunting me. You still can't forget it? That's in the past. Forget it. Drink a warm milk. Good morning, Carmen. What a bad weather. Everyone's kid is sick. Diarrhea. My wife, Trining, is also sick. Not surprising. Almost everyone in the neighborhood is sick. Epidemic, they said. My child always has fever. Out of luck. Even the job I am anticipating last week did not go through. Now, I can't even buy a cigarette. We also received a news that we will be evicted by the 30th. This is embarrassing. My debt's piling but I can't do anything. How unlucky. As if God is mad at us. I hope you have some money to lend me. I just need to buy milk. I'm sorry. I also need money. I'm only earning enough for me. That's my jeepney. We're wet! Do not push them! As I was saying, doing business is difficult. As of today, more than 12 financing companies like us were closed by the Central Bank. There are huge withdrawals from other banks. With our company, if we can't lend to people who will surely pay, why would we operate? The board of directors decided that while we're still in this situation.. It's better if we temporarily close the business. So unfortunately, our operations will only be until the 30th. As early as now, it would be better for us to look for a new job. - Well? - Mr. Montero.. Is there any chance to postpone our payments? That's up to the loan committee. I hope you consider our additional loan too. We're not sure. Sometimes the loan committee approve, sometimes they don't. But with the calamity crisis today.. But we only need 300,000. 300,000? Do you know how much the country's debt is? 30 Billion! In dollars! Even if we start paying it now.. And pass it continuously to the next generations, it'll not be enough! I should probably contact my Dad about the conditions. Well, you can do that. I hope putting our property for mortgage will help. That might help. I'll go to Davao tomorrow. I'll be back next week. Next week? I'm not here by then. As you can see, this is my last day in the office. Tonight, I'll fly to Canada. I'm saying goodbye to all of this. Goodbye to the traffic. Goodbye to the big-bellied police. Goodbye to the floods. Goodbye to the pot holes. Goodbye to yellow things that strung outside the window! They drive me crazy! They don't even do anything! Goodbye to all these uncertainties! BIR investigation! Expensive car registration! Goodbye to the brown-outs! Broken telephone! No water supply! Goodbye to overcharging prostitutes! Goodbye! I'm sorry but I really have to go. I've got this lecture to deliver at the center. The subject is coping with retrenchment. Nice meeting you. Teddy, wait a minute. When will we meet again? Look. I'll call you. No. Last time you said that, I waited all night long. You didn't call. So I'll call you tonight. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. We're still on lunch break. Wait a bit. He's cute. You're good at changing men. I'm done with attorney Barrameda. All he talks about is article 256, article 248. I don't know anymore. I told him get out of my life. Time to move on, baby. Want one? He's vegetarian so I got used to it. Even at work, I'm not lucky. The solution's simple. Get an abortion and find a new job. I told Jerry about it. He doesn't want to decide. He asked me to toss a coin. Great. It's your body and you want him to decide? - Good thing he's letting you choose. - I don't want that. Having no choice is better. Simple. But that makes life better. You're free to choose what you want. You want to be an unwed mother, that's fine. You want to get an abortion, that's fine too. Just don't let problems drown you. Move on, baby. I'm afraid. Of what? Everything. Future. Present. I'm afraid because Jerry might not be in love with me. If that's the case, I'm afraid because.. I might not forget him. I'm also afraid of Bobby's family. They might kick me out once they found out that I'm pregnant with another man's kid. If I'll proceed with abortion, I'm afraid because I might die. If I'll not get an abortion, I'm afraid that my baby might be born abnormal. Three holes in the nose.. Or end up with just a single leg. If the kid's normal, I'm afraid because I might not be able to raise the kid alone. I also fear God because He might put me to hell. You need to be tough. Look at me. I'll remain standing even if typhoons ravage me. And please, Carmen. There is no hell. Heaven and hell is on this planet. We're making our own heaven and hell on Earth. My God. One day, we'll be the only survivors in the Philippines. All people will be on Saudi. Tell me what's worse. Die starving or die of sadness? I think it's dying of sadness. Okay, time to work. Excuse me. Alright. Truth be told, I'm bored. I agree. You can come in now. Let me go first! I'll be applying.. Application? Fill-up the form. Here. The bank's giving us a hard time. Lots of nitpicks. I need to talk to Dad. When will you go? Tomorrow. I'll be back after 3 weeks. By that time, you should go with me to Davao. You don't have a job. I'll think of it. We'll get married before Christmas. At Davao. - I wonder who.. - You're not listening to me. What else do you want? I already allowed you! I allowed you to work here! You want to be independent! - You want.. - Allowed? Mr. Virgilio. No one's telling me what to do. You don't own me. I can decide for myself. Goddamn! I got problems with the bank and you're derailing my plans for you? I don't care. Remember what I told you. Got it? I didn't know he can get mad. Have you told him? Will you tell him? I don't know. Why don't you marry him? He's smart and responsible. I don't want to fool anyone. You can't decide. Let God handle it. Why would I do that? God won't raise my kid. God won't buy the milk for my kid. Will He send my kid to school? What does God have to do with my problem? You've sinned, Carmen. You need to be punished. So this punishment isn't enough? You'll have to endure it. God gave you that problem as a challenge. To see if you can endure it. To test your faith. Don't question His ways. He won't abandon you. Isn't this abandoning me? I'm suffering, aren't I? What else does He want? What else do you want? Ms. Juling. We don't have money. If you want to, I'll give you my kid as my payment. Can you hear yourself, David? You keep on making kids when you can't feed them. Or you can take my daughter, Helen. She's 12 years old. She can be your maid. Then she'll be my cargo de conciencia. Just pay what you owe to me then leave my land. You're the reason why I can't start the chapel I'm planning to build. Have some consideration. I've given you enough chances. Will you be punishing me for the rest of my life? Loss! Just a few seconds gap! 20,000 gone because of that Baby Star. Jerry. Wait for a bit. Ask Fernando if this one's out. That's big! They're at a disadvantage! - Check what's his bet for this one. - Okay, boss. Got it. - Okay, boss. - Alright. Jerry, you need to marry me. File a divorce and marry me. I don't want people to lose their respect to me. I don't want to suffer and endure just like Ms. Juling. Because I'm not doing anything wrong. I don't want to be free like Stella. It's harder to be a free-spirit. Life's a mess if you're a free-spirited woman. I don't want to marry Bobby because I don't love him. You're the one I love! I want you! You should marry me! Why would I suffer? I'm not hurting anyone else! Carmen. When we started, I did not hide anything. If you want us to live-in. It's fine. If you want to give birth, okay. I'll even support you and the kid. One thing I hate. Don't tie me. Are there lovers with no strings attached? Boss! It's out! Put it on the winning horse! 30,000? Yeah, just split it. Alright, boss. - I'll have to go. - Bye. Bye, Carmen. We have lots of visitors from New York and Canada. - Here's Bobby. - Bobby, you're late! Sorry Mrs. Castro I had to check the farm. - Good afternoon. - Hi. - On the kitchen.. - Hi Mom. - Hi Dad. - Ah! My daughter.. Oh, she's in Vancouver and she's doing very well. She has her own car and house. Your kid's really lucky. Eddie Boy is in Chicago. He's called the "Kaldero King". No Filipino haven't bought a pan from him. By just selling pans.. He earns 5,000 a month! More than what a doctor earns. Finally, our kids are all independent. Vergie is on Houston and has a salary of 3,000 per month. It's fine because he's not yet married. George is in L.A. and he has a laundry service. He drives his own car and he plays golf every weekend. We're planning to visit Australia. It's just Bobby doesn't want to go. He doesn't want to sell our farm. It's for my future kid. They'll inherit it. Carmen, that's a hint. Make a decision. You're going to America or Australia? You heard that? I don't think I'll be able to live for 3 weeks here in the Philippines. - Why? - It's so traffic! From the airport to Sta. Ana. - There are more squatters than before. - Yeah, that's true. So Carmen, whatever you may want to do with your life.. Don't do it here. Didn't tell you that.. Where's Poldo? Look for him. Poldo, my problematic child. Carmen, you've grown up! Have you met Aunt Lily? I'll go now. Chito's good at breakdance. - Hi Carmen. - You're enjoying? Bro, your sister. Mom wants to see you. Why? She's looking for you. Wait here. - How's Margie? - In the house. Why not invite her? Any problem? Nothing. Carmen. I'll have to go. I'll check my farm the next day. It's not mine yet but I'll inherit it. Go with me. Margie? Margie? Carmen's here. I'll leave. Carmen! How are you? How cute.. A boy? Sometimes I want to hurt.. Margie.. Mom and Dad beat me when they found out that I'm pregnant and I want an abortion. A mortal sin, they said. They said I'm a bitch and wanted to be a killer. Now, they treat me worse than a bitch. They don't talk to me. They're not giving attention to that kid. Doesn't want to give me money for milk. Look at that. A deadland. How can I leave this? That's why whenever Dad tells me that we should migrate to Australia.. Not yet. What a waste. Every time I think of Davao.. It brings me tears. The city.. It's rowdy. Lots of killings. And here, there are pests. So we should get married soon. So I can start rebuilding this. Why? Your friend's problem again? It's not my friend's problem. It's mine. I'm pregnant. More reason we should plan earlier! You're not the father. Another man. Why do this to me? Why didn't you plan ahead? Why destroy everything? You didn't consider me? You're still the same. Always thinking of yourself. How about me? What will they think of me? What will all of Davao think of me? How about my love? That love? Bury that on this land. You treat me like a plant that you have grown and can harvest any time you want. Life's not that simple. Especially me. Sonya, I'll leave this to your care. Here are the keys, I'll be going now. Bye. Got it. This new place gives good karma. - He's cute. - Yeah. And really long legs..
