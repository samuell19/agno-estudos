You feeling okay? I'm just tired. Do you want me to take him tonight? No, it's fine, you got work. I'll be okay. So, listen, I've been thinking... we should probably, you know, take down that other crib. No. Come on, Mary-- [MARY] This is amazing. I'm not going to lie, this thing is terrifying. Looks like a little demon baby. Jaaaacckkkk. Stop it, you're such a dork. Good night.Good night. [ ADAM CRYING OVER MONITOR ] [WOMAN'S VOICE] Wor-- Mommy's got you. Ssh... ssh. It's just me.

Are you getting enough sleep? You look tired. No, Mom, clearly I'm not. Well, you know, just try and sleep when he sleeps. I guess it's probably a good thing there's only one. Mary! I'm sorry... I don't know why I said that. It's okay, you've been through a lot. Have you gone for a check-up? Oh, we've got an appointment soon. No, I mean for you. You know, Jack offered to fly me out there... to help you out for a few weeks. You and Jack spoke? He's worried about you. I don't know why you had to have kids so young. I'm fine... Richard's got a small dick, so he has to make up for it... in other ways, like getting this giant house. What about you? How do you become a Stepford housewife? Well, Jack became partner at the firm. So, I guess we can afford things like this now. You'll get used to it. One a week... I'm allowed one a week. Oh, no, I'm good, thanks. You're missing out. Okay, screw it. Sorry.Thanks. You've had? To mothers of the year. [ BABY CRYING OVER MONITOR ] [ BABY CRYING OVER MONITOR ] Pretty cool, right? Yeah, we have the same one. I think our signals are getting crossed. Oh, really? I thought something screwy was going on with it. They look cute together. So they're sending me to Pittsburgh next week. I'm closing the Weller account. Come on, this is huge! You remember, we were still in that dump on East 3rd... when I started it. I loved that place. Come on, Mary, what's up? Nothing. You're a bad liar. I'll make you a deal. Once I close it, we'll go to Hawaii for a few weeks. Just me, you and the baby. Yeah? Okay. [ DISTANT AIR APPROACHING ] [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] [JACK] Yeah, yeah, hi. Rachel.Rachel.

[ SECOND BABY LAUGHING ] [ GASPS ] [ SECOND BABY CRIES ] [ SECOND BABY FUSSING ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ MUSIC STOPS ] [ SULLEN MUSIC PLAYING ] Everything okay? Yeah... I'm fine. When a child is brought into this world... it often arrives with a whole host of challenges. You have a brand-new life that you're entirely responsible for. Now in your situation, where the mother has lost a child... at birth, it can put her in a state of perpetual fear... where you have the fear that you're going to lose... the other child as well. This is totally natural with postpartum depression. So what does that mean, what can we do? Jack, would you mind if I talked to your wife alone? Yeah, yeah, of course. [DR. NEILSON] Thank you. I'm sorry about that... but I need to ask you some questions... and I want you to be absolutely honest with me. Have you been having any hallucinations? Auditory, visual, anything like that? No. None. Good, good, good... excellent. I'm going to prescribe some medication... some antidepressants. Just until you get your feet under you... and get your self back onto the road of recovery... nothing permanent, just temporary. Until you find your bearings. DR. NEILSON [V.O.] I know it's hard... but I strongly recommend that you get rid... of anything, anything at all that reminds you of your loss. Anything of his that might be lying around. Now as hard as this has been on you, you need to concentrate... on the fact that you have this beautiful, baby boy... that needs you now more than ever. [ SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ] Jack? [ DISTANT CLATTER ] What is this for? Hey... um-- You don't trust me, do you? No, no, that's not it, Mary. Mary! Come on, Mary, this is not a big deal. I just don't feel the greatest leaving you all alone in here. You won't let me fly your mom in. You won't let me hire a nanny. What else can I do? Don't go to Pittsburg, Jack! That is not an option. Oh, well, okay. [ SIGHS ] [ DOOR SLAMS ] Jack? [JACK] Yeah, I know, I know. [JACK] Don't worry, she's not gonna find out. [JACK] Yeah--[ TOILET FLUSHES ] Whoa. Who were you talking to? What? I wasn't talking to anyone. What are you-- what are you doing, Mary? Mary, stop it! Where did you put it, Jack? Put what? Are you okay? Mary... the house, the baby, it's expensive. So I'm telling you, that if I don't get on that plane... they will find someone who will. Baby, if I don't go... we're fucked. Look at me. You're a great mom. We're gonna be fine. Promise? Yeah. Come here. [ SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ] I love you. It's more Richard's thing, he needs the attention. God knows I don't give him any. You should come. Yeah. If Jack's back. How long is he gone for? A week, maybe two, he's not sure. Business trips, Rich goes on them all the time. Whatever, don't ask, don't tell. Right? Oh, uh, it's not like that. Oh, I just thought you guys were maybe, you know, down. No, No. Not down. Definitely not. I don't know how people do it, personally. It's so archaic. Do what?Monogamy. Talk about repressing your animal instincts. Check it out. Not bad, right? Miranda got just a normal two-Queen... sucker. So it's just the two of you, then? Yeah, for now, Walt flies in Wednesday before the meeting. Must be nice, flying in, shake a few hands, get wasted... and fly out. So, are you... you know, taking your-- Meds? Yes, your crazy wife is still taking her meds... while you're out gallivanting... in some fancy hotel room with another woman. It sounds like they're not working yet. Hah-hah-hah. Check this out. That's terrifying. Yeah, I can watch you all day. So you know, feel free to walk around naked whenever you want. You would like that. Hey, hey, let me see the little guy for a second. Hey, hi, buddy. Hi. Daddy misses you. He misses you, too, don't you? Daddy, come home. Jesus Christ. [ LOUD BANG ] [ ADAM CRYING OVER MONITOR ] Oh, my god. [ EERIE MUSIC PLAYING ] [ WIND BLOWING ] Look, it was probably just teenagers. I mean, they're bored and getting into trouble... all the time around here. How's he doing? Fine. They're a lot tougher than they look. Do you have kids? Uh, no. I recognize you. Yeah, I just live a few doors over. Look, if you need anything, don't hesitate to knock. Okay, it's probably quicker than calling 911. Thanks. Ssh... ssh. It's not fine... I hope these punkass kids try this shit with me... I will be out the door so fast... I don't care if they're ten years old... I will beat the shit out of them. Relax. I need a drink. [MARY] Up. Sweet. Oh, crap. What?It's empty. It is? Yeah, no worries, I got some at my place, like five minutes. Can you watch him?Yeah, sure. [ DISTANT THUNDER ROLLING ] [ DIALING, RINGING ] Hey, you've reached Jack... I'm not here to take your call right now. Shit. [ EERIE MUSIC PLAYING ] Mommy's gonna be right back, okay? Shit. [ ADAM CRYING ] It's okay, sweetie, Mommy's right here. [ ADAM FUSSING ] [ STEPS WALKING ] [ FLOOR CREAKING ] [DEMON WOMAN] It's okay, Adam. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] Adam! Adam! [ ADAM FUSSING ] [RACHEL] She's fine, she's just really upset. She called you a dozen times last night after it happened. I know... I hear you. No, she didn't sleep. He wants to know if he should come home? I don't think that's necessary. I mean... she's safe now. It's fine. It's no trouble, really. She's just really shaken up. I think maybe she just needs some time for herself. How is everything going with you? Oh my God, that's hilarious. Okay, we'll chat soon. Break a leg, Jack. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Yes? Hi. Are you Jane Henderson? Can I come in? The first time I saw it... it was in the middle of the night... when I went to go check on her. It was just standing there... watching her. What did you do? I froze, completely. It was all so long ago. Anytime I was near her... I felt like there was something watching us. My daughter was never safe. And then one night, I heard it. And at first, I thought it was a voice in my head... but it wasn't. What did it say? I recorded it. JANE [OVER SPEAKER] Please, leave me alone! Leave me the hell alone. [ BABY CRYING OVER SPEAKER ] JANE [OVER SPEAKER] No, you can't! I won't let you! Stop it! Stop it! She's mine! DEMON WOMAN [OVER SPEAKER] Your daughter... mine. [ SCREAMING OVER SPEAKER ] Did you show these to the police? They didn't care. What is this? That's the bitch who's trying to steal your baby. JANE [V.O.] You have to make a choice, Mary. It's your baby... or somebody else's. It's the only way to savehim. JANE [OVER SPEAKER] Please... she's all I have. [MARY] Mothers and expectant mothers... [ BABY CRYING OVER SPEAKER ] [MARY] Slaying children. JANE [OVER SPEAKER] You're not real... You're just a voice in my head! LAMASHTU [OVER SPEAKER] No... real. JANE [OVER SPEAKER] Why her? Why us? LAMASHTU [OVER SPEAKER] I like her. [MARY] An offering may be accepted. [ FAINT RATTLING ] [ CAR ENGINE STARTING ] SHEILA [OVER PHONE] You need to call Jack. He says you're not answering his calls.

It's just me, baby. I'm sorry.It's just me... okay? I thought you were it! You thought I was what? It's just me. I tried calling you, but it went straight to voice mail. You don't have to worry. So I hear our neighbors might be having a Halloween party... next week, that could be fun, right? Yeah, sounds fun. I'm gonna get someone to come and fix that window today. I'm coming out of the closet today, too. I'll introduce you to my lover Donald tonight at dinner. He likes to be on top. It turns out I'm what they call a power bottom. Sounds good, honey. I'm gonna take Adam to the park. You want me to pick you up anything? [MARY] Maybe some stronger coffee. You got it. [ SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ] Did you forget something? What do you mean? I got a new kind, they say it's earthy, but strong. What? You just left. Mary... I've been gone almost two hours. Ah, there we go. Must be a hell of a book. You should have seen this kid today, he was such a trooper. He didn't even cry once. He's killing it! [ CRYING ] I can't-- where is he? Where is he? Mikey? He's gone.What? Someone took him! What do you mean? I lo-- I looked everywhere for him, and I can't find him. What are you talking about? I can't find him... I can't find him. I can't find him. Mary. Adam! Oh, where did you find him? Give him to me. He was sleeping, baby. He was in his crib. No. Oh, my sweet, baby boy. [MARY] Mommy's never gonna leave you again, I promise, okay? [ HUMMING ] Oh, hi, hon. Coffee's hot.

Yeah, yeah, it's really great, Mom, it's just-- I just hope that he, um... I just hope that-- Shut the fuck up, Adam![ CRYING STOPS ] I hope he keeps it up, you know? I'm thinking about switching to soy milk. You know, because I've just been reading this article... about dairy and the negative effects... it has on a baby's digestive tract. And I just want to make sure that he's okay... because it could be really bad for him. So... how are you doing, Mom? [JACK] Mary, I'm home. Mar? We're in here! [JACK] Mary? Hello?

No, Jack, listen to me! You have to keep Adam with you at all times. She wants to take him, he's in danger. The only person that he's in danger from... is you. No, come back! Come back! You shouldn't have lied to me, Mary. It's called postpartum psychosis... and it's a hell of a thing. Quite frankly, you've lost touch with reality. Lost the ability to discern between what is real... and what is not real. And as for these incidents you've been having... the voices, hallucinations, Mary, it's all in your head. And this episode you had with your child, I have to tell you.. I've seen it get much, much worse. First we gotta get your meds changed up. The hospital is gonna wanna do a full psych evaluation... before you can get in to their psychiatric ward. [DOCTOR] Your husband's on his way. [JACK] Mary? Hi. Adam. He's okay. Don't worry. I'm a terrible mother. I'm so sorry. No, you just gotta get better... soon.
