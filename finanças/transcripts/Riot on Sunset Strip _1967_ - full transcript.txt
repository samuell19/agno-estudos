MAN: [ON SPEAKER] Ladies and gentlemen, everyone under 18 must be off the street by 10:00, or be subject to arrest. All right, move it. Do not block the sidewalk. [LAUGHING] ...everybody under 18 must be off the streets or subject to arrest. All right, you kids. Break it up. NARRATOR: These are not dangerous revolutionaries, in a beleaguered city under martial law. These are teenagers on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, California. On a peaceful night. Irresponsible, wild, beat, protest youths. But nowhere to go, nothing to do, no goal in life. Just searching for one thing they've demanded throughout the ages. Right of self-expression, and recognition. What you see here is happening all over the world. And in every country the question is the same. What to do about the youth problem? Officer, it's getting worse every night. I've never seen such riffraff. Now the authority's ought to do something about it. I'm sick and tired of it.

It could be in your town or mine. -[HONKING HORN] -Hey, come on! -[CONTINUES HONKING HORN] -Come on. NARRATOR: With ordinary kids like yours or mine. -Oh. Dig these new wheels. -GRADY: Yeah. How do you like it? It's posh, Grady. I love it. Love it! What's it run on? Gas or kerosene? Lighter fluid. [CHUCKLES] -You've met Liz-Ann? -Oh, hi, Liz-Ann. How're you doing? -Hey, who's the wild one? -Oh, well, this is Andy. Uh, she's new here. She just got here last month. -GRADY: Andy who? -Dollier. Oh. Hey, well jump in, I'll give you'll a ride home. -Come on. -Okay, great. Come on, hop in. You want a lift, Andy? No, thank you. I'll take the bus. Hey! I just got a great idea. Let's all go to Pandora's Box tonight. -Crazy. -Oh, I dig that. You wanna come too? Oh, I think I should stay home. Oh, come on. You can make it, Andy. It's a ball. Okay. Would you pick me up at Liz-Ann's house? Sure. Groovy. Right after chow. -Okay, we'll see you later. -[ENGINE STARTING] -[ENGINE BACKFIRING] -[LAUGHS] [ENGINE BACKFIRING] NARRATOR: Yes, today's youngsters are no different than we were. When school's out. They plan their nights out. Their plans usually include a trip to the Sunset Strip. Where teenagers and young adults, wearing outlandish clothes and hairdos. From within a radius of a 100 miles, congregate every Friday and Saturday night. Walking around aimlessly. Walking the traffic and the sidewalks. Much to the disapproval of the older generation. [ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYING] Friend comes in handy. Doesn't he? Right. Yeah. -Hey. -Mmm. Look, I don't make the rules, Grady. If you want little blast in your diet drink, I can understand that. What are you? Gestapo or something? The manager, honey. And I've to live with the police department. If one of them took a sip of your drink instead of me, that's all, brother. They padlock me so fast. Minors drinking in my place. WOMEN: [ON RADIO] Unit 3-7. Unit 3-7. Code 459. Possible 211. 1865, North Bare Lane. Repeat. 1865, North Bare Lane. Unit 3-7. Acknowledge. Uh, Unit 3-7. Roger. Roger. Proceeding to 1865, North Bare Lane. Over and out. So, we begin another jolly, thrilled packed evening in kiddy land. You said it. [ENGINE STARTING] [SIREN WAILING] Let's see that, sonny. Grass. -So, what's wrong with smoking? -Yeah. It just so happens that smoking that stuff is against the law. So is breaking and entering and trespassing. So what harm are we doing? Who we bothering? The landlady for one. She called in. No, look the only reason grass is illegal is... Is that the public doesn't understand. It's an anachronism. Aren't we better off sitting here than getting hung up drunk and cutting out on wheels killing each other? It's still against the law, miss. It's a bad law. A little public education and as soon as the public understands they'll change the law. Sure, sure. Why don't you say this through your hearing. -Maybe it can do some good with the judge. -Yeah. [SIREN WAILING] I honestly can't believe you two are my daughters. This is what you call a Van Nuys slumber party? Look at you two. Compared to you, Dracula would look like a fairy princess. Where did you get those ridiculous clothes? You certainly weren't wearing them when you left home yesterday. What did you do? Go some place and dirty up? Wait till I get you two home. On second thought. Maybe it would be a good idea to let them keep you here in jail. Teach you a good lesson. -Officer. -Yes. -Would you do me a favor? -What? Would you lock up these two tramps and throw the key away? Sorry lady, we already got our hands full as it is. Come on, you two. I'll let your father take care of this when we get home. MAN: And now to another point. You know that the merchants, businessman and real estate owners are forming an association to save Sunset Strip. To save the Sunset Strip from ruination, by the invasion of long hairs. They are petitioning not only all the top officials but anybody to do anything. I've heard that, yes. Doesn't that indicate to you sir, that the situation is crucial? Well, wouldn't say it was crucial. Serious, may be. I agree we have a problem, but I think we're well able to keep it under control. What about advising kids, underage kids? Drinking, smoking marijuana, using drugs, acids. Would you say you have that under control? Mr. Stokes, I'm not pretending these kids are little angels. There are law infractions. But when my men and the Sheriff's men find such infractions, they crack down. You'll find quite a few violators out there in reception. But these are kids, Mr. Stokes, our sons and our daughters. Maybe they create a nuisance ganging up in one small area, but you want me to throw them all in jail for that? But are you advocating that we keep hands off? Let 'em riot, rock busses, destroy property, fight an innocent passerby? No, I don't propose to let them or anyone violate the law and get away with it. But getting together in groups is not unlawful assembly as long as they keep quiet and peaceful. When they start disturbing the peace, or becoming a nuisance, or the things that you mentioned. Then they constitute unlawful assembly. Then they're in violation and that's when my men will move in. That I can assure you, Mr. Stokes. Now, if you'll excuse me. I've got lot of work to do. Thank you. That concludes our interview, ladies and gentlemen with Walt Lorimer of the Hollywood division. Good evening. Thanks, Walt. Interview will be on the air. You're welcome to it. FRANK: Watch the camera on the door. Good night. Coffee, Walt? Yeah, Frank. Thanks, I need it. You try to use a little restrain and common sense they tell you to crackdown. Then you move in, lean a little, they scream, "police brutality." That's about it. Put on a badge and there's just one thing sure. -You can't win. -Yeah.

I have to see a phone book. All right. Let's get a phone book and let her call. Yes, sir. Book these three for inciting a riot. That includes you. The rest of you just wait here for your parents. Mom, we were just dancing this time. [HORNS HONKING] I'm so sorry to have bothered you, Mrs. Tweedy. Oh, it's no bother at all, Andy. It's so good seeing you after all this time. How long has it been? -It's been 4 years, three months and two days. -I know. I'll admit, it was a surprise a phone call from you after all that time. I didn't know who else to call. Now, what direction? Where are you living now? Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take me home. -Oh, it's no trouble. -No, please, just take me to the nearest bus stop. -But... -That'll be fine. [SMACKS LIPS AND SIGHS] It's no trouble, Andy. I've been enough trouble as it is, to everyone. You're not any trouble, Andy. Big deal, tough guys with your badges and guns. Picking on little kids who ought to have a little fun. Why don't you go after some real criminals? Like gangsters and mobsters, they're strangling this country. Maybe a few murderers. Nah, you're too chicken for that. Stir up a little too much grease around here. -Oh, Pop, will you cool it? -Don't you tell me to cool it. Dragging me 40 miles from my garage in the middle of the night to come out and get you out of the clink. Peace officers! Why you jokers couldn't keep peace in an old lady's church social. OFFICER: All right, mister. Do us a favor and take your boy home and yourself, too. Walt? Come on, Walt, let's go home. All the dear parents showed. Something's wrong. Maybe we ought to ask for a bonus... All this new business. Hey, you got any plans? What do you mean? Just because I'm a bachelor doesn't mean... I mean, Helen just called in. Asked me to bring you home for a snack. No, no. Strike that. Let the record show she ordered me to bring you. Helen. You got a rare one there, Frank. -Pick of the litter. -Will you come quietly or shall I bring out the cuffs? [CHUCKLES] When do you advice of my rights? [LAUGHS] What rights? When woman like Helen cracks the whip, none of us has any. [DOG BARKING] Oh, there you are, finally. What kind of a daughter are you? Staying out half of the night. Doing god knows what. Suppose I'd needed you for something. Did you ever think about that? Get in here. You want me to get to my death, standing here? Get in here! Get in here. The parents, they're the ones we should be busting. You must remember, Frank, that a lot of these children come from broken homes. Like Walt's daughter, Andy. Helen, not now, please. It's all right, Frank. It's all right. It's been a long time now, I'm getting kinda used it. It's been four years since you've seen, Marge or Andy. -Mmm. -FRANK: Helen, please. The only contact I have with them now is when I send the support checks to the court and they forward them somewhere. You mean you don't even know where they're living? No. What difference would it make? They don't want to see me anyway. I saw Andy. Oh, when? -HELEN: Tonight. -Tonight, where? At the station house, your station house. She came to see me and I wasn't there? HELEN: No, Walt. Why didn't she wait? Walt you don't understand, she didn't come to see you. -Helen please... -Frank, I know what I'm doing. When we first came from England and you joined the force, while everybody else was making fun of you, it was Walt, who helped us. Well, I think he needs a friend now and we're here to... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are you two trying to talk about? Well, Walt. Helen asked me to bring you home tonight because... Well, because she wanted to tell you about Andy and... What about Andy? Something happened to her? Was she in an accident? One of you tell me something? Andy was picked up near Pandora's Box. Just a curfew violation. [SIGHS] Well, she should've seen me anyway. You're the last one she'd ask for. She called me. It's funny. Before her mother and I split up. Andy and I were so close. But why did she call you instead of her mother? I don't know, Walt? I only know your little girl needs help. She needs someone. She either can't or won't turn to her mother. She tell you where she lives? No. She wouldn't let me take her home. Just to the bust stop, no further. Well, it's easy to find out. Being in the police department has some advantages. Have you ever tried before? Uh, you know I haven't. I didn't want to stick my nose in where I wasn't wanted. Helen, I'm glad you stuck your nose in. [CHUCKLES] Grady, you're not grounded. No. My old man was so bugged at the cops, he forgot to pull my wheel. Then we'll make the Strip scene again. Its what's happening. -Oh, crazy. -Groovy, huh, doll? I don't think, I can make it. I mean after what happened last time. You mean being picked up by the cops? Curfew violation, that's nothing. Oh, it's like the missiles, once you had them they never bother you again. I know. But it's not that. It's just... Just don't count on me. I'll see you later. It's that bad, huh? At home, I mean. -Well, you know how it is? -Try to make it, though. Huh? -If you can, give me a call okay? -Okay. GRADY: Well, it's too bad. Cute little fox like that all crazy mixed up. -What's her bag, anyway? -It's not her, honey. It's the old lady. -She's a juicer. -Oh, what a drag. It's worse than we eat. Grown-ups, you can't leave them out of your sight for minute. What about her old man? Is he on the juice, too? Who knows, he's the invisible man. You mean nobody's ever seen him before? For that you'll get a high IQ. -High IQ, too. -[CHUCKLES] Let's split. [ENGINE BACKFIRING] What do you propose, Walt? What's your solution? Everybody would like to know. The whole city, the whole world for that matter. I don't have a solution. That's hard to take, Lorimer. You are the assigned watch officer. And theoretically, you're responsible for law enforcement on the Strip. -Theoretically? -Yes. And we're more or less forced to entrust our well being our business future and keeping of the peace to you. We aren't allowed to take the law in our own hands. -You're darn right, you aren't. -[CHUCKLES] Might be interesting, don't you think? Can you just picture a group of vigilantes on the Strip, armed with barer shears? And after we grab the few of these goldy locks boys, and fix 'em up with crew cuts, I'll bet you they'd all take to the hills. Uh, what about a few baths? Maybe we'll get some shoes for their feet. No, no. Now, let's not be sadistic. And that would solve the problem, wouldn't it? Chase the kids off the Strip. And you could make another mint in your fancy antique shop and plush restaurant. Then we're supposed to sit quietly while these creeps drive us out of business. Look, we were in business long before you ever heard of the Strip, and the taxes we paid. Then you and others come along and open up these filthy little dives for these young morons and our business is shut to hell. And where are these morons are supposed to go to have a little fun if not the filthy dives like mine? What are they supposed to do? Sit home and watch television while their parents are out making the town? Well, they don't have to ruin the Strip! You just don't know what you're talking! -Who doesn't know what they're talking? -You don't! All right. All right. Let's not lose our heads. I'm sure Mr. Rosh and Mr. Arnow, aren't proposing that we start pushing these kids around. Of course, we could use tear gas, beat them up. Use hand grenades or, uh, riot guns. You gentlemen do have your rights and I'm sure you've been hurt by what's happening, but we've got to remember that these are kids. Not anarchist or armed mobs. Our sons and daughters. Maybe they're a little mixed up, but so were we at their age. -We came out of it, all right. -So will these kids. What do we do in the meantime? Well, I've got an idea, Perry. You send these some of the kids to me, I'd like to talk to them. AYNSLEY: Talk to them? Who understands their language? [MAN CHUCKLES] How about it, Perry? -I'll be glad to. -Good. Maybe we'll find out what these kids want. Explain our problems and you gentlemen's problems. You really believe you can talk sense with those kooks? If they had any sense, do you think they'd act like that, dress like that, live like that? Wear the hair like that? I don't honestly know. All we can do is try. The kids and I will cooperate. I promise you that. If you'll excuse me. -Well. -Ah. I told you there was no use coming here. He's living in a dream world. Now, we've to get signature on petitions buttonhole everybody we know. -Do something. -That's right. [SIGHS] You know, I just wonder how many of those kids out there on the street, really know what a good friend they've got in Walt. So basically what you're asking for is the change in the curfew law from 10:00 p.m. to midnight. Right? -Just on weekends. -Friday and Saturdays. During the week, 10:00 p.m. is all right. -For six months. -Six months? To give us a chance to prove that we are responsible. And that's what these demonstration are all about? PERRY: There are other things. Kids should be allowed to go to their cars unmolested at curfew. Let them talk, Perry, that's why they're here. Go on, I'm listening. Like he said, we want the police to change their attitude. They don't have to act like private servants for the Sunset Strip Establishment. And when we're questioned by police, we want to be treated like anyone else. An enforcement based on law of violation, not length of hair, manner of dress or economic conditions. You go to college? I'm in my third year, straight A's. I see. Anything else? -No, that's about it. -Basically. Well, the points concerning my men I can do something about it, provided the kids stay in line, stay out of trouble. We're working in that. Our own police force. With arm bands to keep order. To assist the police, sir. Well, just see you don't take the law into your hands. Because the curfew that's not in my department, it's a local ordinance. Which is hurting my business. That's not the problem here, Perry. I'll see what I can do to follow through, in the meantime keep a lid on the kids. I think we can straighten this thing out. We can kip the lid on the kids but can you hold your police in line? I'll do my best, that's all I can promise. Okay, thank you very much, sir. -Keep an eye on them, Perry. -I'll try. MARGE: Is that you, Andy? I want to talk to you. Okay. Oh, Mom, you promised me you wouldn't. Not tonight. Tonight was supposed to be some kind of a test. Eh, I know hon, I tried. I really did. But you know all I've gone through. It's too much for anybody. And if you're any kind of a daughter, you'd try having a little sympathy. You'd try and have. Forget it. STOKES: [ON TELEVISION] At the beleaguered Sunset Strip area girded itself an anticipation of another troubled weekend. Police and Sheriff's deputies all over the city and county, were put on standby alert. It was made public today that merchants groups and realty associations were demanding a crackdown, stern measures. But enforcement authorities were still asking for calm conciliation. For instance, Walt Lorimer, head of the Hollywood division of police, interviewed a few days ago, told me... Well, wouldn't say it was crucial. Serious, may be. I agree we have a problem but I think we're well able to keep it under control. But these are kids, our sons, our daughters. Maybe they create a nuisance ganging up in one small... [SWITCHES OFF] Daughters. Liz-Ann. Andy. Are you still making the Strip scene? What time could you pick me up? I'll change, too. [ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYING] Come on! Whoo! Whoo!

No. Come on, Alice in Wonderland, you haven't lived. Let's make it. WALT: No. No, thank you. I'll call you later. [DOOR OPENS] How's it going out there? Strange enough, quiet. Here take a look. A brawl started a while ago at Pandora's, liked they promised, the kids stopped it. At least they kept their word. I only wish, I could keep mine. What good was it for me to write the city hall, the big shots, the county, all the politicians I know. I can't even get 'em on this. I don't understand. Don't they care, don't they give. Who knows. Who knows. It's a pressure from guys like Aynsley and Arnow and... And others probably. Frank, there's only one answer. They not only don't want those kids making trouble on the Strip, these don't want them there, period. They'd rather have it bust wide open, give them an excuse to clear 'em out of there for good. Well, that's pretty cold blooded. Do you think of a better answer? I can't. I've been sitting there nearly going crazy trying. Well, at least we have a quiet night for a change. Yeah, quiet, very.

Not one of us. Well, tell me what the score is. I don't how to tell you. I wish didn't have to. -Walt, don't go out there. -Don't be ridiculous. Walt, you can't do any good out there, please! Andy? Is that you? Andy, you're here? What happened? What do you think happened? Are you all right? Am I all right? [SOFTLY] Oh, you're funny. You're funny! [LAUGHS] What's the matter with you? Stop it! Stop it, I said! I wanna know what happened? I'll tell you what happened. Five boys have been here, with me. With you? I got sick and tired of being alone. What do you care? You know that's not true. It isn't? You're forgetting, I'm your father. No, I'm not forgetting. But you have. -Andy I... -Please. Get out of here. -But... -Look, you left me alone for four years. Now, let's keep it that way. Walt, the ambulance is here. They won't get away with it, Frank. Any of them. What... What's happening? So, this is her friend, huh? Young lady, I don't know how much you know about cops. But that's our boss's daughter upstairs. Andy's father, a cop? [GIGGLES] She never let on. So I'm warning you, if you know what's good for, you'll co-operate with us every way. Take her in the car. [LAUGHING] I'll call you back. Walter, what's all this talk, I hear? Bunch of kids breaking into a house. An acid party, some girl being raped. Stokes, why don't you just disappear. Vanish. Look, what's eating you? I'm trying to do my job the same as you do yours. Only the public's got a right to know. Let me know as soon as my wife calls. All right, Sergeant. -Everything quiet? -Just like Beverly Hills. Hey, you wanna stay here tonight? Sure. Herbert Harley, Donald Itsam. I got a warrant here for your arrest, requested by the Los Angeles police department. What's the charge? Breaking and entering, misuse of private property, creating a disturbance, rape. Rape? Oh, is that what she said? Listen, that little trick was asking for it. She was begging. The only trouble is, sonny, she wasn't old enough, to ask or beg. You ever hear a jailbait? Well, you're gonna fine out what it means. One question, sir. Who was the Rat Fink that put the finger on us? Does it make any difference where you're going? Now, I'm required by law to advice you of your rights. You don't have to make any statement. Anything you say now may later be used as evidence against you. You're entitled to legal representation. If you can't afford to pay, a lawyer will be provided at public expense. -[SCOFFS] Crazy. -Wow. All right, George. Let's go. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Any word from the hospital? Not yet. Walt will you please, please stop driving yourself crazy. What else can I expect? Her mother's more to blame than you are. There's nothing you could have done. Will you get that through you head? -Where are you going? -Where father belongs. Then get you chin up off the floor for Andy's sake, will you? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I'll get right back to you. Oh, sir. Three rape suspects are at the hospital for the girl to identify. But the doctor say, she shouldn't be disturbed yet. So, the men wanna know, do they keep them at the hospital or book them? Bring them in and book them. What's the big rush, anyway? Walt? Walt. [WHISTLES] General Hospital. Code three. [SIREN WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Yes, I'll tell Dr. Hanes. Thank you. Working the late shift again, Mr. Lorimer? No. I, uh... I have a daughter here. Probably using her mother's maiden name, Dollier. Andrea Dollier? Yes, I'll call. -MAN 1: Man, what a hang up. -[MAN 2 LAUGHS] Can you imagine him pinching us for something like this? -It's crazy. -Yeah. MAN 3: What makes this chick any different than the rest of them? You lousy, filthy, scum. You punks... Get the orderly. Hurry up. FRANK: Walt. Walt. Walt! This is Walt Lorimer, head of the Hollywood division. I'll handle it. I'm sorry, Frank. When I say those punks acting like... Like nothing happened after the... After what they did to my daughter. I couldn't help myself, no father could. I heard that, Lorimer. I'm gonna have to quote you. Don't you have any feelings? Don't you know what they did to my daughter? They raped her. She not even 18 and they fed her drugs and they raped her. The whole bunch of them! My god. You have to report this, I suppose. It's news. And even if I didn't, you think those kids aren't gonna spill their guts. I just know they will. Tell Walt, I'm sorry. What have I done? Suppose I've been carrying my gun. Sir, you can see your daughter now. Thank you. In there, room 133. What are you waiting for? You have to see her, you know. After what I've just done. Well, don't think about that. Think about Andy. She needs help. A lot of help I can give her. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. Andy, you're up. Should you be? What happened to me isn't usually fatal. I, uh, guess you heard what just happened. Who could help but hear it? The whole hospital heard. It's par for the course. I don't think I deserve that, not from you anyway. I'm sorry but I don't have any medals. Look, Andy, what I did, I did because I thought... Well, I was wrong. You thought. Your thoughts ever where they should've been? Wait a minute. Maybe I'm a little thick, but what is this? What difference does it make? I wanna know. Oh, sure. Now. Where were you before? How come this sudden concern over me? Beating up some kids because I said they took advantage of me. Knowing what happened to you I lost control of myself. Would it made any difference if it'd been another girl? What were you doing? Playing hero? Or just feeling guilty because you haven't even bothered to see me all these years. When your mother moved away she never told me where... Oh, come on. You of all people could've found out... Didn't care. Too busy making speeches on television. Andy, I... I do. Say, Walt... Hi, Andy. Say, Walt, I'm sorry to interrupt. But all hell is about to break loose out the Strip. -Huh? -Radio and TV are full of what happened here. That started it. You better get out there, we're gonna have our hands full. What can I... What are you going to do? Turn in your badge? Resign? Resign? Well, sure. Isn't that the easy way? Haven't you always run away from responsibility? Look, Andy, I know, I... I understand how you feel but you're wrong. 'Cause God is my judge, you're wrong. [CHUCKLES] I'm wrong? Honey, I really liked to talk about this. Can I come back later? Right now there's not enough time. That's just it. There never was enough time. I don't wanna talk about it. Not now, not later, not anytime. Just forget it! STOKES: [ON TELEVISION] We have just returned from General Hospital. And the news of Walt Lorimer's assault on three of the rape suspects has spread like wild fire on the Strip. Juveniles on their way home are reported thronging back to the West Hollywood area. Crowds and the youth night... are chatting defiance of curfew regulations, and refusing to move aside on police instructions. Special police and Sheriff deputies in record numbers are being mobilized and dispatched to the beleaguered Sunset Strip area. The irony is that, Walter Lorimer, was known all over the city as the enemy of violence and the best friend of the boys and girls. If I were Mr. Lorimer, the last place I'd be seen tonight is on Sunset Strip. -Today in Washington... -[TURNS OFF TV] How'd it go, uh, with Andy? Could've been worse. I better get out on the Strip and try to hold it down. After the way I lectured, "No brutality. No violence." Then they see something happen personally, and... They know how much I really believe in what I preach. Thanks very much, Helen, for... -Come on, Frank. -See you. [PHONE RINGS] This should answer that cop. Let's see. Maxine, that's telling him. Well, this will show him, too. Eh, that's not bad. Wait till you see this one. "We want peace not police." -Hey that rhymes. -That's a real groove, ain't it? -Yeah. -You ought to make a career out of that. You mean, I ought to become a poet? -No. A house painter. -Aw. -Forget her, pal. She don't dig realism. -[CHUCKLES] -Where did you learn to print like that, anyway? -Why? -Because there'll be TV cameras all over the Strip. -Oh. Hey, let's not hassle among ourselves. Save that for the police. [INDISTINCT PROTESTS] AYNSLEY: Well, chum, tonight is really tonight. It's kind of a shame. Yeah, it's the best thing that could have happened. How else could we get rid of those kooks once and for all? After what those punks did to that girl, they've lost all public sympathy. Now, the cops and the deputies won't have to hold anything back. Well, I just hope nobody gets hurt. Well, they're bound to lay the wood through a few heads. But isn't it worth it? Hmm? [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [INDISTINCT PROTESTS] -Curtis. Pritchard. -Yes, sir. You're handling this just right. Good work. Frank. [INDISTINCT PROTESTS] -Break it up. Everybody 18 and under, hold. -♪ Let's go either in or out. Come on, let's go. Break it up. Let's go. Move along. Come on, get through this area. Come on, let's go. Break it up. Let's go. Clear out. Come on, move along. Let's go. Come on, break it up. Good evening, sir. How are you, Sergeant? How is it going? [CROWS CLAMORING] Well, if that's all it is, it's all right, Sergeant. Just keep it that way. MAN: Come on, let's go. You gotta clear this area. It's not worth it now. No, trouble. Let's go. Move along. Clear the area. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Move it out. Come on, let's go. ♪ Girls, your identification, please. Both of you, sit there and wait. [INDISTINCT PROTESTS] -Well, that's a gestapo. -Lorimer, you lousy cop! Don't you touch that kid! Just put him in the wagon. Thank you very much. Thank you. I saw what you did on the Strip, on television. They discharge you from the hospital, did they? They wanted to take me home. You're all right, aren't you? Dad, didn't you hear what I said? They wanted to take me home. Yes, I heard you. I didn't want to go. I'm glad. Dad, the things I said at the hospital... How's your mother? I mean... I know. Pretty bad. My car's out front, come on, I'll take you home with me. Don't you have any work to do? Oh, the Strip's under control, the kids are all gone. [CHUCKLES] Where will they go now? I only wish I knew. NARRATOR: That is the question. You can close down their clubs, impose curfew, arrest them. Punish their neglectful parents. But one fact remain, soon half the world's population will be under 25 years of age. They must go somewhere. Where will they go? What will they do?
