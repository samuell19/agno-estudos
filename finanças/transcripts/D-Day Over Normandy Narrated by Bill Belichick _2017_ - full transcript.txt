- My name is Bill Belichick. I've been very fortunate to be a professional football coach for many years now. It's a career I continue to feel very passionate about and one that I became interested in at a very early age thanks to my father. The biggest influence in my life has been my dad, Steve, who played in the National Football League and was also a football coach for 50 years at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. That's where I grew up and learned much about the game. Like millions of other men of his generation, my father who passed away in 2005, served his country in World War II. Dad was in the United States Navy. He spent time in both Europe and the Pacific. The men and women of the World War II generation, such as my father, are responsible for all we have today including my own opportunity to be a professional football coach. The following is a story about one day in World War II, June 6, 1944, D-Day. A time of both heroics and horror experienced by teenagers and young men. Many locations still show the marks of battle decades later. This film brings us unique views of the landscape of Normandy, France. Intertwined are the stories are the stories of the men who fought on these beaches and among these French villages to preserve our freedom. On June 5th, on the southern coast of England, in towns, villages, seaports and airfields, tens of thousands of men are about to board planes and ships, ready to begin the liberation of Western Europe from the Nazis. - We'd had briefings for several days, so we knew that this was the invasion of Normandy. - General Eisenhower visited our unit down in the marshaling area. We were in a compound behind barbed wire fences, couldn't talk to anyone. - In our training we were told, you know, the old story, look to your right, look to your left, only one of you is gonna survive. - I'm only 18 years old, what the hell did I know about anything. And, so I really, I had no idea that this, how big an invasion this was. - The paratroopers were among the first to leave, heading across the English Channel in the late hours of June 5th, taking a route that would drop them over Normandy's Cherbourg Peninsula. Below them, thousands of ships filled with American, British, Canadian and other Allied landing troops were also headed for France. - Soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force, I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory. - I was sitting where I could look out the door and as far as I could see there were ships, battleships, cruisers, PT boats. I told someone, I said, that's where I think there are even some canoes in the bunch. All they ever, everything heading towards France. Everything England had. And then when I could look up, the sky was full of airplanes. - Yes, it looks like he could walk over there on those ships. - When I went on the plane, there was very little noise, no talking whatsoever. You hear people say, well I wasn't a'scared, don't let them kid ya. When your life is on the line, everybody's excited and scared. - The Pathfinders were the first to jump on D-Day. Over 300 of this special force parachuted around villages and towns with names like Chef-du-Pont, Amfreville, Sainte-Mere-Eglise and Sainte Marie-Du-Mont. Men such as the 82nd Airborne's Bill Hannigan, headed for fields and villages behind Utah Beach in support of one of D-Day's first missions. The early arrivals jumped into Normandy to help guide in C-47 planes carrying their fellow paratroopers in the early morning hours of June 6th. - They just told us it would be a dangerous mission. - And a Pathfinder goes in a few hours ahead of the rest and sends up a homing device. It's a device that's you put in the ground and when you put it in the ground and set it you can't see it but that palace could in the distance. - We came in low and fast, too fast, and too low and we hit the ground you know quickly and which we liked but it was dangerous. This is not a fuzzy arrangement this is the real McCoy and you wonder if this was your wisest move. Maybe it wasn't. - One vital objective on D-Day for American paratroopers was the 11th century French town of Sainte-Mere-Englise which was a key road junction. Henry Duke Boswell of 82nd Airborne was bound for the town, as was fellow paratrooper Emmett Nolan of the 101st Airborne Division. It needed to be taken to prevent German counter-attacks from reaching Utah Beach to disrupt the eventual troop landings there at 6:30 a.m. - Just before we got to Sainte-Mere-Englise, they had a big cloud bank thousands of feet up and all the planes just disappeared into it. - The pilots that were flying us, this was their first mission. - Our original drop zone was Sainte-Mere-Englise. - We parachuted into Normandy landing about two o'clock in the morning not too far from Sainte-Mere-Englise. - I jumped and of course you jumped with a group of people but then when you started coming down, you're all by yourself. There's no one right near you, the wind scatters you. - By the time you got up 15 men traveled probably from a half a mile to a mile. So we were strung out all over that Cherbourg Peninsula. - They were shooting at us, machine guns, anti-aircraft, we could see the tracers coming up. I got out of my shirt, got my rifle assembled. - And we missed Sainte-Mere-Englise. - I can remember I, when I landed I landed in a tree and I didn't know, it was pitch black. - I understand that we were the only unit that landed on our correct drop zone, 505, the others had missed theirs, some by a little, some by a lot. - Scattered all over, soldiers from different divisions, regiments and units, gathered into small groups and headed out for the nearest objective. - And we were involved in a battle right away with the Germans. - One of the companies had jumped right over Sainte-Mere-Englise and they came down over the town. Some of them landed in the trees, they were shot by the Germans who were right there before they could get out of their harness. - Walked into Sainte-Mere-Englise and saw John still hanging on the tower. I thought he was dead, he'd been wounded and they later got him down. - At 4:30 in the morning, the battalion commander raised a flag over Sainte-Mere-Englise over the City Hall. So that was quite an accomplishment, so we had that time to breathe, then we had to hold it. Our job was to block the cross roads and the bridges and keep more Germans from getting down to the beach to drive our people off. - There were several attacks on Sainte-Mere-Englise by the Germans and the 3rd battalion '05 was able to repulse the attacks. - All around Sainte-Mere-Englise and the small hamlets and towns of Normandy, were what the French called the bocage also referred to as the hedgerows. The majority of villages in the region were surrounded by farmland and these ancient hedgerows, dense vegetation and trees growing up from mounds of soil sometimes rose to 30 feet in height. Dating back to the 16th century, the hedgerows were natural borders that kept the cows in the fields and defined property lines of the farms. - They were so thick you couldn't see anything. - The bocage in Normandy was so dense that an American paratrooper could be standing just a few feet away from a German soldier on the other side and have no idea each other was there. It was an unnerving way to fight. - You had to fight your way through a century or two of growth on 'em. - 82nd Airborne paratrooper Bob Chisholm was bewildered by the bocage. - The hedgerows was quite difficult and our intelligence hadn't really briefed us on it so I don't think they even knew about it. - Among the hedgerows and just about five miles from Sainte-Mere-Englise was another key landing zone for the American paratroopers. The ancient village of Sainte Marie-du-Mont which provided key exits off Utah Beach for the landings. Dominated by a church that dates back to the 11th century, the village was a key objective of the 101st Airborne on D-Day. Like nearby Sainte-Mere-Englise, Sainte Marie-du-Mont had been occupied by the Germans since 1940. It needed to be taken to prevent German counter-attacks when the beach landings began. Unknown to Allied planners on D-Day, was the location of four German 105 millimeter cannons just outside of Sainte Marie-du-Mont at a place called Brecourt Manor. Brecourt Manor dates back centuries and to this day is still owned by the de Vallavieille family it remains a working farm. On D-Day the four German guns were located along this hedgerow facing towards Utah Beach. As the landings got underway, the German guns began blasting away. They needed to be silenced. The difficult mission was given to First Lieutenant Richard Winters of the 101st Airborne Division. Winters led 11 other soldiers in the initial attack to knock out the guns defended by roughly 100 Germans in and around this field. A trench that once ran along the hedgerow was the only route to attack the guns. It was early on D-Day morning. - Take out those guns is the way it was put to me. The first thing I did was go off by myself, crawl out this one hedgerow to scout it out. After I scouted it out I could see where a machine gun was and I thought there was a gun in that hedgerow there. I knew enough about where the trench was and where these guns were came back and I gave my orders. Was Compten, you go up this hedgerow and I'll go up this hedgerow. I split up what we have here so that if we do get pinned down we both won't be pinned down at the same time and we got everybody together and set up the two machine guns we had to lay down a base of fire and had Compton, Popeye Wynn and Malarkey go out there and try to put some hand grenades on them, so that with the instructions as soon as you throw those hand grenades, we'll all charge which we did. And we were fortunate enough to get in there as those hand grenades are going off and we got on top of them and we got in the trench. - Just a short distance from Brecourt Manor, where the four German guns were silenced, is a monument recognizing Richard Winters' bravery and leadership on D-Day. The Richard Winters leadership monument was dedicated in 2012. The monument not only honors Dick Winters' own D-Day efforts which resulted in the Distinguished Service Cross but those of all American junior officers who displayed so much courage on June 6th, 1944. Damian Lewis played Dick Winters in HBO's Band of Brothers. - Dick was very, very skeptical. He was suspicious of Hollywood and he said, "I don't want my story, "the story of my war, the men I shared the war with "turn into some sensationalist Hollywood thing." And Tom had to talk him down and you know, just say, we guarantee you will do everything we can to make this social document not a bit of sort of sensationalist storytelling. And Dick was won over and he was very, very proud to be associated with it. - Around 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 6th, 1944, the Allied beach landings got underway. Utah Beach on the very western end of all the invasion beaches was the objective of the American 4th Infantry Division. both Bill Miret and Jim Gaff were in on the first wave as the Navy began approaching the beaches and began to receive fire from German gun emplacements and pillboxes. - Everything is seemed calm until all of a sudden you had taken troops to go to the beach. - It's hard to look back out there and think that we've brought our boats in as close as that. - This is a special bulletin. The long awaited British and American invasion began. - They were everywhere. I mean all kinds LCIs, LCTs, LSTs, destroyers and they were just covered with ships. - We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast. - Eisenhower's headquarters announces Allies land in France. - This is D-Day. - Allied troops began landing on the northern coast of France this morning, strongly supported by naval and air forces. - My LST was just loaded with wounded soldiers and the tank deck was full of cots. - A landing was made this morning on the coast of France. - When you think about it, you know an entrenched enemy in pillboxes, looking down on the beach with machine guns and cannon and those soldiers crossed that beach, took an awful lot of guts. - The British American landing operation against the western coast of Europe, from the sea and from the air, are stretching over the entire area between Cherbourg and Le Havre. - Today a museum dedicated to the Utah beach landings stands just off one of the key exits soldiers took on June 6th, 1944, to move inland from the beach. The Utah Beach Museum, built from an old German bunker that faced out towards the English Channel, was the vision of Michel de Vallavieille, wounded on D-Day as a teenager during the fight around his family-owned Brecourt Manor. At about the same time the landings were going on at Utah Beach, 30 miles to the east, two American divisions were also coming ashore on Omaha Beach to secure that part of the Normandy coast. Walter Szura was with the 1st Infantry Division, Mort Kaplan was a Navy Beachmaster, tasked with traffic control. The eastern end of Omaha was the responsibility of the 1st Infantry Division. - Yeah, you're scared. You tighten up and you don't think, I didn't think about it, says what happens happens. - Several hundred yards of open beach and murderous German fire awaited their arrival. - A lot of firing, ships, planes and strafing. How are you gonna explain this and machine guns coming from the beach. - Climbing across little fences things of that sort, there was some in the water, bodies which had been cut in pieces. - I saw a lot of bombardment on this shore and after the second day we served as a hospital ship and carried casualties off of this beach into London, England. - Then there was a cement wall, when you hit the beaches there's a cement wall still there, part of the cement wall a lot of us guys hid in it, we land up in there and that's where I headed for. - Today a monument to the 1st Infantry Division's heroism stands guard over the eastern end of Omaha Beach. Nearby the remnants of several German bunkers and machine-gun nests stare coldly back at this part of the beach. On the western end of Omaha Beach, the fighting was just as fierce as it was on the eastern end. Hal Baumgarten of the 29th Infantry Division, came ashore in the second wave. The inexperienced 29th fought their way in just below the French village of Viereville-sur-Mer. Crossing 300 yards of open beach was the challenge facing Baumgarten and his fellow soldiers on their pre-assigned landing zone on Omaha. - I got shot in the rifle. It vibrated, I turned it around, my seven bullets in the magazine section saved my life. So I didn't get wounded until after I hit the ground. I looked up at the pillbox number 73 on the right flank and a 88 went off in front of me. Ripped this cheek off, ripped the upper jaw off, holding the roof of the mouth, teeth and gums on my tongue. - The men had not seen combat yet and consequently you know they had that innocent high morale and exceptional training and if anybody could do it, they knew they could. I mean and it was interesting because they combined that rawness with their landing partner to the east, the 1st Infantry Division which was exactly the opposite and you know they had already been in two amphibious assaults and were highly, highly experienced. And so it was a good combination of the two units because they brought two different perspectives to the whole operation. - All these guys that you knew as your friends, you trained with them and they're there laying dead. When I look at Dog Green Sector I see all the bodies. It's kind of sad each time. For example on Dog Green Sector we lost 85% casualties in the first 15 minutes. - As is the case on the eastern end of Omaha, time stands still on this part of the beach with German gun emplacements and bunkers still intertwined with the landscape. While the Americans fought their way ashore on Omaha and Utah over on Gold Beach the British began to land close to 7:30 that morning. Frank Amalfatano was an American assigned to a landing craft responsible for bringing British troops into Gold Beach. - All I can remember that in front of us was a big hill then there was a lot of resistance up in front of us and then we got into trouble, that the soldiers didn't want to get out of the boat. We used some rough language but then we finally got them off. - Within range of Gold Beach and Frank Amalfatano's British troops were the large German gun emplacements at Laurent-sur-Mere. - And there was a lot of booming, banging going on and I think to myself that we were 18 years old and we didn't know what the heck we were doing, know what was going on. - By 6:20 that morning, three of the four long-range guns had been knocked out by British naval fire. The fourth would not be silenced and captured until June 7th. Roughly halfway between Omaha and Utah Beach in the American sector lies the 100 foot high cliffs of Pointe du Hoc. On D-Day, the 2nd Rangers were facing what was considered to be a suicide mission, climbing the cliffs under German fire to eliminate six big guns believed to be on the Pointe. The mission was called the most important on D-Day by Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, as the enemy cannons had Utah and Omaha Beach, and the ships in the English Channel within range. - When we got to Pointe do Hoc and landed and our ramps went down, we got on the beach and made our way to the bottom of the cliffs where we had fired our ropes up over the tops of the cliffs and they were draped down in front of the cliffs. And it's 100 feet straight up. We had to run to the rope and climb that rope with our gear and all. And all the way up the 100 foot cliff was being shot at at the same time by the Germans along the top of the cliffs, and they were dropping grenades on us and trying in every way possible to keep us from successfully climbing that cliff and getting up there and battling it out with them. And it got to the point of hand to hand combat at times. But we did, we were lucky, a lot of guys weren't lucky, we had heavy casualties. - It turns out the guns the 2nd Rangers had been after had been moved inland to a nearby apple orchard. - Only the large gun positions that is believed to have housed the coastal guns at Pointe du Hoc, they weren't guns at all, what appeared to be their barrels were telephone poles, very dark and they were maybe stained or painted black or whatever. And from an aerial photograph, I don't know how high they took it at, it looked like the guns were in these particular positions. And my platoon and company had positions four, five and six on the west side of the Pointe. They weren't there. When we found no guns, we headed for the road to establish a roadblock. I only had 12 men, so I told 10 of them, with their sergeants, now you guys go ahead, set up a roadblock and make sure no Germans get through here to keep contact. And Jack, you come with me, my platoon sergeant. I said, you and I are gonna go find those guns. Well, Jack and I could only remember this one sunken road that went to the rear. And we saw what looked to be the wagon wheel tracks on the dirt. And this hedgerow, and it was a hedgerow was a good nine, 10 feet tall, with 50 foot trees out of the top. And there lo and behold are the guns of Pointe du Hoc, only five of 'em. There were supposed to be six. The five were in position, they were aimed at Utah Beach and they had their shells all orderly set up, ready to fire. And remember further that the Germans never believed anybody would be crazy enough to come up those cliffs at 'em so they didn't have them very heavily guarded. There were no guards on the guns that I saw. But I went in and I had his grenade, a thermite grenade and my thermite grenade. Then I took my field jacket off, I wrapped that around my submachine gunstock and I smashed the sights of all five guns. So I destroyed the sights of the five guns so they couldn't sight it. I destroyed two of the guns with a thermite grenade and I said Jack, we gotta run back and get the other guys thermite grenades. And I was able to take those grenades and put one each on the remaining three guns and repeat what I had done before, thus putting all five guns out of action so they could not be used. That was our mission, that accomplished our mission. - Of the 225 Rangers assigned the mission, 135 were dead or wounded after two days of battle. - We were successful for the next couple of days in the beating off attacks by the Germans, we accomplished the mission of D-Day and we were relieved, D plus two and our wounded were taken care of and our dead guys were taken care of. And why I say that is because there weren't very many left of us after that battle, of D-Day, at that point in time. - Thanks to the air force, prior to D-Day, and then shelling by Allied ships in the channel on June 6th, the Pointe is forever scarred with massive craters. - I came to the area where they were gathering the bodies of the men in the battle. And lo and behold they had all my guys lined up, laid out along the roadside, on the shoulder of the road with a name tag on 'em and who they were and preparatory to taking them to a cemetery or a morgue or something, somewhere. But they had all young men together and here for the first time, I was seeing what happens in war. We indeed come here brothers, we still are. I had brothers in real life, but I don't think my own blood brothers or any brother meant more to me than my fellow Ranger buddy. - Today, a monument on top of Pointe du Hoc recognizes the Rangers' courage and sacrifice. Back behind Utah Beach another fight was raging just outside of Sainte-Mere-Eglise in the tiny hamlet of La Fiere, Ted Morgan, a medic and the American 82nd Airborne Division, found himself right in the middle of the fierce battle. La Fiere and this bridge and causeway along the Merderet River had become some of the most important real estate in Normandy. - I think we had to be there on the scene to understand what a major objective that was. - Where did the Germans were trying to get across and we were trying to push him back. - The Germans needed the 1600 foot long causeway to send reinforcements towards Utah Beach and the American landings there. The 82nd Airborne was fighting to prevent that from happening. - Because that was the major bridge over which the Germans could send in reinforcements and they weren't able to do that once we secured the bridge. - Ive heard it described as one of the most important battles of the Normandy campaign and they lost quite a few people. - there was artillery fire, small arms fire. - Disabled German tanks symbolized the fierce fight going on to hold the bridge. - With their weaponry they had a, this 88 was just an amazing weapon. We had to be covered, we had to take cover and eventually with the reinforcements with tank reinforcements from the beach, we were able to secure the bridge but it took two or three days to do that. It wasn't a simple task. - The fields surrounding the causeway had all been flooded by the Germans to prevent paratrooper and glider landings. - Some of our men became casualties, they drowned in the water that flooded the fields. - The destruction of the local manor and the surrounding buildings was extensive. Across the causeway on the German side, the ancient church in the hamlet of Cauquigny was leveled. The entire area had become the focus of a fight that may very well determine the success or failure of the Utah Beach landings. - There was one of our troopers injured on the side of a road going to the bridge. I remember taking care of him and while I was taking care of him there was a German tank coming toward us and he kept saying Morgan, there's a tank out there, there's a German tank coming towards us. And I wasn't about to leave him, I couldn't carry him and I just didn't pay much attention and all of a sudden the tank drew up beside us and a German head popped out of the turret. He looked down at us and the casualty, he says, "They're going to kill us Morgan "they're gonna kill us both." All of a sudden the head went back down, the tank cover closed, the tank took off up the road which was probably a miracle I guess but that was, I remember that vividly. - Finally on June 9th, after three days of savage fighting and hundreds of casualties, La Fiere and Cauquigny were in the American hands. Today a monument to the fight stands near the Merderet River just yards away from the bridge. It features an airborne paratrooper referred to as Iron Mike. 22 miles away from La Fiere, is the French village of La Cambe. La Cambe is inland near the ancient French town of Bayeux and behind the Omaha Beachhead. Just outside of the village can be found over 21,000 German war dead from the fight in Normandy. The German cemetery here is a quiet and somber place. Men and young boys who died because of Adolf Hitler's vision for Germany. - He managed to call upon some nationalist ideas, you know there was the First World War which the Germans lost but the general feeling was that we had been unjustly treated so he was welcomed by the majority as a leader who takes us out of that misery after this First World War. And by the time some people became aware which way he was going to lead us, he had enough power so the resistance was very difficult to organize. - One German soldier that I was treating hauled out a wallet, took a photograph out of it, and it was over his family, his wife and kids back in Germany. And I thought then and I to this day I felt sorry for him. He didn't want to be there you know. He was forced to be there and here he is seriously wounded. - About 10 miles from the German cemetery at La Cambe outside of the village of Colleville-sur-Mer, and rising above the cliffs overlooking Omaha Beach, is the Normandy American Cemetery. Over 9,300 white crosses and Stars of David marked the resting place of American soldiers, fathers, sons, brothers and husbands who also died in the fight for Normandy, many on D-Day. It is meticulously cared for by the French. - Going back there and standing beside those crosses and knowing who was buried there even to this day it's heart rendering really. You think of those guys, you remember them as if it were yesterday. It's a sad occasion just to go there to visit. - Their lives were cut short, they never got the chance to realize an adult life and they were just kids really and they never had a chance to have families and children and all. It's sad. It's sad. - Yeah, it is the common sentiment that every man you take back to Normandy says, you know, the only heroes are in the cemetery. And it's unspoken, but the predominate theme when then return is that it's an honor to the men who never got a chance to grow old. - When I got out I had to go back to high school, finish high school and then I had to get to college. Those are the key things that I needed to do in my life to get on with it. - Thought never comes your mind what I'm gonna do this because I'm a hero. It's something you do because it's what you're trained to do that never ever entered my mind that I was a hero. I was just doing what I was supposed to do what I was trained to do. - Well you were proud of your outfit, 'cause you lived up to the tradition of the outfit, you know what I mean. Satisfaction because we had just accomplished our mission. - If I contributed just a little bit to their success you know I'm proud of that. - There was no way that I was gonna let my personal feelings or my fear interfere with completing the mission that we were given and especially if it had anything to do with my fellow troopers, I was not going to let them down. The fear of letting them down was more of a fear than getting getting wounded or getting shot. - I was proud to be a military man during World War II. - I earned one Silver Star, two Bronze Star for valor and six Purple Hearts. - It was an experience that I knew would probably be the most important thing I did in my entire life would be part of that invasion. - The legacy of the men who fought on D-Day and served in Europe and the Pacific as my own father did still resonates today. Their courage, determination, sacrifice and belief in their country and fellow man is unrivaled in our history. Despite the passing of my dad and more and more World War II veterans each day, I hope what they humbly accomplished will always resonate with future generations. The men and women of World War II won as a team and that's a lesson for all of us as we too try to accomplish great and noble goals in our own lives both personally and professionally. Men like my father and millions of others gave so much to make sure we have that opportunity, both on June 6, 1944, and during the other momentous days of World War II.
