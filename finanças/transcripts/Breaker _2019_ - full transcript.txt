- What are you doin' here? Thought you didn't come until tomorrow. - Today. What are you wearin'? - My house, I can dress how I want. - Why don't ya put some pants on. - Why, 'cause you're here? Last time you were, you said it wasn't good enough. - Couldn't last six months, huh, J.C.? Our boy's got quite the discipline problem, Linda. - Hey, give your brother a ride to the store. - I haven't eaten since yesterday. - Give your brother a ride. I'll rustle somethin' up. It'll be on the table by the time ya get back. - Ah! No discipline, huh? - Tom! Tom! - All right, boys. - Okay. - Glad you could make it. - Mornin', Darrell. - You get lost? - Nah, how ya doin'? - We're okay, this is one of the buildings we gotta do. - Yeah. - It needs a lot. We can get her done quick, make more money. - That's Tom Enterprises, quick, right there. - We got some drywallin' to do in here. You guys do hang Sheetrock? - Oh yeah, yeah that's our in-house pro right there at hangin' drywall. Ain't that right, J.C.? He's the best. - What's wrong with him? - Military. - Oh, you served, son? - He did. Kicked his ass out. - Well my dad was military. - Now where you goin'? - I gotta pick up some plastic siding for tomorrow. I'll be back in an hour. - That's a piss poor job. That looks like shit. Job's runnin' into more time and money. I bid everything on materials and time, but the longer you take doin' this job, the less money I make. I want an itemized receipt. We need to get this job done. You're not gonna get paid, ya understand? Burnin' daylight. - Hey! Hey! - Why you back? The hell you ridin' a bicycle for? You get a DUI? - No. - Then come on, let's go get you a real bike. This guy that I work for, he's got more money than he knows what to do with, so hop on. Hop on. - Seriously? - He won't care. Just bring her back. Or don't, I won't say nothin'. Start her up. You look like James Dean. Woo! - Where'd ya get that? - Harris. Why you drivin' Tom's truck? - Well, I was late to a client's meeting, and Tom's in a bar, doesn't need it. - You're kidding me. - What's that? - Supplies for a job Tom was supposed to be on. - Well, you know Tom. He's the brains behind it, not the worker bee. You get money for those supplies? - Yeah, from Darrell, contractor at the middle school. - Spare $10 for gas, consider it my commission? - All I got is 20. - That'll do. Love ya, honey. - What the hell was that? - Daytime activities. - Well, well, well. Took ya long enough to finish that wall, junior. - You're never gonna amount to anything. - Hey. Ah! - Hey, hey, knock it off. - Expect me to do all the work for you? - Hey, okay, hey. Okay, leave him alone. Get him a beer. - I'll get ya a beer. I couldn't decide what my table was on. - Here. Good work today, though, junior. - Is he goin' to the speedway next week? - Why don't you ask him. - Speedway? - Yeah. - You guys still doin' that? - As long as the old dog still owns it. Hey, I'll call. - I can't go. Got dinner with the in-laws. - They'll be outlaws in a couple of years, isn't that right, J.C.? Isn't that right, J.C.? He knows how it is. Damn fool, went and got himself engaged. Can I buy ya a drink? - My boyfriend may not like that. - Who's your boyfriend? - He's not from around here. - If I was to talk to your boyfriend, - Mm-hmm. - and he said it was okay, - Yeah? - you'd drink with me? - What are you buyin' me? - Anything you want. - Okay. - Hey! The hell outta here! So listen for-- - Wake up, you got paintin' to do. - Other than the stain on your record, Mr. Phillips, the military isn't interested in pursuing it. - Any chance of reenlistment? - There's no chance of reenlistment. You have RE-4 status, which means you can never again apply for a military position. You have a good day. - Come on in! It's for you, babe. - You want some food? - I'm all right. - You sure? - Have some food, stay. - Hey, babe, we're gonna go in the other room, okay? What's wrong? - Can I stay here? - I don't think so, man. We don't have enough room. I need you to stay at Mom's. - What about work? - Nothin' that you'd be interested in. - I can do anything. Clean toilets, drive the backhoe. Whatever. - How do you feel about killin' animals? - Like a slaughterhouse? - My boss and his brother's got shitter horses on his land and they're eatin' up all of his grass. And it's costin' 'em a lot of money. - Can't ya sell 'em off? - Nothin' they can do with 'em. Bunch of studs kicked over some fences and tried to mate with the nicer horses. So, the old lady wants 'em to go. - How much you offerin'? - Couple hundred apiece. Don't say anything to her. I've put her through enough already. - All right. - What's with the drone? - I forgot to charge it. - They spotted a herd out here a couple of nights ago. Guess we just gotta go find, 'em boys. - This legal? - BLM can't figure it out, so we gotta do it ourselves. - Can't let the government do anything by itself. - I mean, ranchers call it in all the time, man. - Why don't they just drive them out? - See, the ranchers pay for the land, right, but they don't got enough grass. Now you don't have enough grass, you can't pay your bills, feed your families. Ranchers are this community, but BLM, they don't care. Just politics, man. - You get one? - I missed. - Scared off the whole herd. - I saw it. Great big white one right down there. He fired a shot into the air and spooked him off. - I'll take that. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Leave him! He can take it, he's tough. Come on. - You're on my land. What are ya doin'? - I was campin' with friends. We got separated. - Well you're away from town if that's where you're headed. - How far? - 10 or so miles. That way. You huntin' or fishin'? - I'm sorry. - This one's got no tack on it. You can jump on him. - I don't know how. - You'll find out. Other side. Hold on to his mane. He won't do much. Come on. - This your place? - Last time I checked. Get off. Take that. Need a ride someplace? - No, I appreciate it. Borrow a phone? - I'll give ya a ride. Come on. What kind of job do you work? - Construction, odd jobs, whatever really. Why, ya got somethin' for me? - These are all my horses. Picked 'em up at the BLM corral. - I keep hearin' that. What is that? - Bureau of Land Management agency. Set up to manage federal lands. - How many ya got? - Oh, 20 or so. Otherwise they just round 'em up and ship 'em off to Canada. - They got more room up there? - No. They got legal slaughtering. - Is it illegal here? - For now, thank God. My aim is to set up a non-profit, pull out as many as I can, rescue them, set up a kind of a destination point, ya know. Get the public involved, maybe the veterans. - That one there the alpha? That banged up one. - The old mares tend to be the alphas. - And the stallions? - Strength doesn't make you an alpha. Stallions generally just fend off predators like coyotes and things like that. - And the mares? - See, her job is to create submissiveness, dependency with the others. I mean look, you see how alert she is? The others look to her to know how to react. - She vicious? - Can be. - Oh! - Round of applause! Woo! - Mornin'. - Mornin'. You lookin' for Linda? - I work for the Bureau of Land Management. Some folks in town said that they saw you ridin' a green KLX motorbike. Is that true? - I don't own a motorbike. - We found it on a road near some dead horses, mustangs, near Ana reservation. - I work up near there. - We find out that you been ridin' that kind of bike, lotta people in the sheriff's office are gonna be very interested in seeing you. - All right, gimme a few minutes. - Yeah. Name's Collins. - You get a call from a neighbor again? - We found some dead horses not too far from here, near Ana Reservoir. - Ranchers? - Probably hired some kids to do it most likely. You know this guy? Said he worked for you. - Yeah. He's runnin' late. Better get to it. Kids, huh? - Yeah. Well, take care. - How much did them ranchers offer you? - Nothing. - My guess is that there was a few of you. Somethin' happened, they took off. You scrub out that trough. I'll finish this. - You're the last person I expected to see. How you been? - Can I borrow a car? - Who's ridin' this one? Thought you didn't drive anymore. Come on then, killer. - Have you spent time in detention as a juvenile? Private! There's gonna be an investigation into this. - Woo! You in a hurry? Where you off to, Daytona? - Do you want a job? - I already got a job. - No, I mean workin' with horses. I need a hand with the feedin' and doin' some odd jobs. - Do I get to ride 'em? - You get to work. You get to doin' that well, then we can talk. - How much? - Not much. - 15? - 10 bucks to start, and all the fresh air you want. You know where to find me. Tomorrow mornin', six a.m. - Where the hell you been? - Tom, you know I don't like that cussin'. - I better not find you been workin' for one of my clients. If I find you've been screwin' me. - Tom! - Screwin' ain't a cuss word! Who's it for? Interesting. He need any paintin' done? I'll come by and talk to him. - He doesn't need you. - Oh, we'll see, we will see. - Nobody wants you to come around leechin'. - Hey! - Callin' me a leech? Huh? - What'd I say? You livin' under my roof, I don't wanna hear any goddamn cussin'. That goes for you, too. Wipe that smirk off your face. - Don't you be comin' back drunk. - What's he gonna be givin', relationship tips next? - I mean it. - Hey! - Don't keep drinkin' and drivin'! - Tom runs a business. You don't need to worry about him. - That's right, you're talkin' to an entrepreneur. - Can you even spell that? - Oh you should talk. - Yeah. - At least I'm not cheap. - Who you callin' cheap? Who you callin' cheap? You think just because you were in the military, huh? Ooh, he had to work for a livin'. You know what, ever since you come back every time I ask you to borrow just a little bit of money, you make me feel like I am this small. You are livin' in my house and I haven't seen any rent money. Shut up! Son of a bitch. - I was supposed to be goin' out to see-- - Hey. - Hey! Here! Here, take it. Here. - Go ahead, grab your purse. We ain't lettin' this little shit spoil our evenin'. - Here she goes, see what happens now. Oh, she's off again. - She's lettin' me on this side a little better. - J.C., this is Matt. Matt helps us out with the horses. - Nice to meet ya. - Nice to meet you, too. - What do you think, Matt, think we can make a cowboy of J.C. yet? - I think it'd be good to have some help around here. - Show him how to do it. - She's a little tricky today. - Hey. Let's go for a ride. - All right. - Here ya go. Here. Mount up and follow me. Grab those. Spread 'em out over there on the bench. Why'd they discharge you from the military? - Fighting. - Thought that's what they paid you for. - Not your own men. - Come on, get up. - Won't be workin' in the afternoons anymore. I'm sleepin' in the afternoons. - Shittin' ass brother. - Gettin' a little headway. - Woo! - Feel good? - Yeah. - Little steps. - Is it always that easy? - He's been started before. He likes to trust people, he's got a past. You want his respect, you're not gonna get that by quittin'. Go again. Okay just, now, I want you to turn side onto him. Stop, just stop, just stop, stop. See, look, he's curious, he's comin' in. He's comin' in. Just stay still, stay still. Give him some attention, then just walk away. It's not about winning. It's about gettin' a partnership with him. Let him come to you. Look at that! Look at that, eh? You earned his trust. You didn't get it by quittin', good boy. - You better take care of this. - He was such a sweet kid, easy, wouldn't even cry. I don't know, I just, I thought, ya know, that the military woulda straightened him out. You have kids? - My wife and I were, we never got that lucky. - First time you hold 'em... You don't plan for the rest. - Linda, does J.C. know how to ride a motorbike? - Him and his brothers been ridin' their whole lives. Dirt bikes, stock cars. In fact he was ridin' a bike last month. - Was it green? - Yeah, one of Harris's I think. - You wanna eat? What do you think about helpin' me out? Run the farm. - What do you think I been doin'? - No, I mean like, runnin' it. Let me tell ya how I came to get this ranch. There was this old timer, he just left it to me. It was just a weed patch. All the buildings were fallin' down. We didn't have any phones with cameras back then, so we only took pictures intended to be for somethin' special. Yeah. There it is, that's it. I was as skinny as a whip back then. So, why do you think he let this place fall apart? - I don't know. - 'Cause he had no one to leave it to. He had no family, he had no kids, he had nobody. He just let all his hard work go to waste. That's him. His skin's like worn out old leather, hands are like shovels, all dried out. If it wasn't for him I don't think I would still be here. He never said much, but when he did it was just slander. - So why are you helpin' me? - 'Cause I got all this and I got nobody. I got no one to leave it to. - What about that boy in the picture in the other room? - I can give you a ride home. - Just can't believe Harris would do-- - Honey, who's at the door? - It's been nice seein' ya again, Lauren, thank you. - Thanks for comin' by. - You got the balls to snitch on your brother? What the hell were the sheriffs doin' over at my house, J.C.? What were the sheriffs doin'? - Hey! - I didn't say anything. - Go on. - Get the fuck off of me. - Come on. - Shoulda never came back here. I got nothin'. - It's warm. I know a guy up in Stenson runs a construction company. - Stenson? - Ah! California? You won't make much, but get ya outta here. - I actually like what I'm doin'. - With the horses? - Yeah, I like it more than money. I got a horse now. They got problems, just like us. - You make a livin' off that? Can I come see it? - The horse? - Tomorrow. - I'll think about it. - That's it. Go on. - Are you serious? - How long's this gonna take? - As long as it takes. - I'll just stay here and listen to the radio. - No, you'll drain my battery. - What else am I supposed to do? Go on, get this over with, I'm bored. - Why are you always drunk? - This is it, huh? Nice lick of paint on this house right here, she'll look brand new. - Who are you? - Tom, J.C.'s brother. I run a paintin' company. - You got a business card? Let me guess, you run out. Well, no matter. J.C. can give me all your information. Thanks for comin'. - When can I expect your room and board? - I already gave it to you. - When? I haven't seen it. - I been puttin' it on your dresser. - Yeah, don't listen to him, he's a liar. - I don't get my room and board, you're not comin' back into my house. I didn't raise you to be a liar! - Your family doesn't seem to like you, J.C. - That's family, though. - You're not tied to someone because you share a bloodline. Be respectful, but it's not a life sentence. - She won't remember what she said by tomorrow. - Look, just stay here. She needs money, so she needs you. Makes you dependent. - I'm not a horse. Who are you to tell me? - I've lived it. - It was a hundred bucks. - Yeah, for 10 hours that you worked. It's simple, just stay here. I won't charge you for anything. And you listen to me, kid, I'm givin' you good advice. - Advice? Who are you to tell me? - I'm sorry? - You can't even take care of your own. - You get out. Wait up. - Is that why your family left you? - Don't you ever confuse kindness with weakness. Now get off my land. - Ya know, paintin' ain't that bad. You know that, right? - Yeah. Look at the place. - How's it goin'? - Well, we got some walls to do in here. Now the walls need to be cleaned. Gotta be clean. - Yeah, we got it. Clean. - We gotta do somethin' with the ceiling tiles there, too. - Same color? Si, Jose. Unload the. Oh, J.C.? - This guy is a clown. - Complete clown. - Can I get this case of beer? - $10.59. - Where are you goin'? - Out. - Showin' houses again, huh? - More than you'll be doin' by the looks of things. So'd they settle up with ya? - I can get you room and board next week. - Where are the keys? - They're in the truck. - Food's on the table. - You ever seen a horse kick? I mean really kick, for its life. It can kick right through a two-inch board, break it in half. See, in the fall three years ago my wife and I were up on the ridge lookin' for lost cattle. We'd been up for about 30 hours. We came across this ravine. My wife, she points out down to the bottom a horse trapped in the mud. She pops off her horse like a box spring and races down to it, mud up around her ankles. I raced down after her, but before I can get to her the horse starts buckin'. He catches her right upside the head. She survived. They kept her for a few weeks in the hospital. I knew that she'd never be the same again. She was gettin' these terrible nightmares where she'd be ragin' and screamin', wakin' up the kids. We fought sometimes. Physically. - Where is she now? - She was plannin' on movin' up to her sister's. It's further up north. They were headed out of town on Highway 20, when your car ran into them, racin'. - Lauren, open the door. Lauren, please open the door. - Let me get two of them slaw dogs. - Everything's gone to hell since you came back. - You deserve it. - Now it's my turn to take something from you. - Finch, where are the horses? The gate's unlocked. - J.C., J.C.! J.C.! J.C., Jesus. Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that. Go. Let me do this, son. Go. Go. Go, get out! - Uncle Tommy there? - He's in the back. - I just need a place to crash. - He doesn't wanna come to the phone right now. He said you should stay with your mom. - We got a lot of horses to work and a short period of time to do it, so there's not gonna be a lot of time off. I don't have a whole lot to offer ya. You know, it's up to you if you're willin' to sign on and try to make this work. - Would I be workin' with horses every day, or? - Every day. - As your counselor probably told you, I run a horse rehabilitation program just outside of town here. I know exactly what it feels like to be where you're sitting today. My dad left when I was really young and I didn't respond very well either. I got into all sorts of things, racing cars, any way to lash out. And eventually I got in a car crash. I know you're angry. After I was discharged from the military I came back home and I got a job on a ranch workin' with wild horses. It taught me a lot, a lot about myself. More than I learned about them. I don't know, if you're lookin' for somethin' to do, maybe even learn somethin' about yourself, I'd love to have ya. Your counselor can give you my information. - It's for you. What's it say? - It mentions you. Is Finch gonna be okay? - He didn't do anything wrong. - Do you know who he is, Finch? - I saw him at your court hearing after the incident. He just sat in the corner. He was sad, didn't move. - How do you repay someone like that? - You're doin' it. He came and visited me at the hospital. He gave me time. And I don't wanna waste any more. Ever. - Me either. - I'm glad you did it. - You cleaned up nice. - They did it at the hospital. - Come on. - This is Grace. - Harris. - He's my brother. ♪ The father to his son ♪ ♪ Says ya have to be weak to be strong ♪ ♪ Ya have to be scared to be brave ♪ ♪ Ya have to know fear to be saved ♪ ♪ The son to his father ♪ ♪ Says I'm too scared to be a man ♪ ♪ I'm too dumb to be a fool ♪ ♪ Father, help me understand ♪ ♪ And he says ♪ ♪ Run, run, run, run to catch your soul ♪ ♪ Every man must learn to love his demon ♪ ♪ Your demon's name is yours ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ War, war, war, war against your soul ♪ ♪ Dig, dig, dig, dig your coffin's hole ♪ ♪ Everyone must face their demons ♪ ♪ And now the turn is yours ♪
