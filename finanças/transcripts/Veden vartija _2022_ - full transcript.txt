AFTER THE WATER WARS AND THE TWILIGHT CENTURY, THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF FRESH WATER. THE REMAINING WATER IS CONTROLLED BY A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. WATER CRIMINALS ARE SEVERELY PUNISHED. My father used to say... ...that death is water's ally. At times it moves hidden in the water. At other times, water drives death away. Life, death and water. They walk hand in hand. In this world and in all of us. My father, Kai, said he was here for this village. He was a tea master. He quenched the thirst of the body and the mind. MEMORY OF WATER Why don't you come with me? Help me at the university. Why don't you stay? Continue your research here. Noria. Kai wanted you to have this. My own tea master's book? What will you do? Will you continue your father's work here? Stop. CLOSED What are you doing here? How's it going? Are you serious? You're bypassing the army water pipe? - Our pipe. You want me to mark your door right away? Why bother the army? I can bring you water. - I'm no beggar. You'd rather be a dead thief? Not everyone has a choice. You'll get caught. That'll make Minja a water criminal. - I'm a criminal? Of course you're not. Right? Fine. Fine! What's that? A pendant. It used to belong to my father. Can you look after Minja for a while? NEW FILTERS FOR DESALINATED SEA WATER CAN BE PURCHASED ONLY FROM THE STATE SUPPLY CENTRE. Get up, okay? My tummy hurts. Excuse me. Could I have some water? Thank you. Stop! Let go of me! ...rain water is not safe to drink or to be used in farming without properfiltration. Yesterday a group of terrorists attacked Mosqua's main water treatment plant. The conflict with the armed forces led to the death of 15 terrorists. General Ye Cixin will tell us more. You can't send her home. She needs pure water in order to get better. No shit. How am I supposed to get it? Like everyone else. Boil it, get new filters, ask the authorities. I can't afford it. Noria. Stealing water is as low as one can get. Major Bolin. We caught two of them. Thank you. What happened to them? They went to the Lost Lands. Will the poison kill them? - Yes. It's very likely. Am I going to die? No. You will live for at least another... ...25 to 30 years. Why did they go there? Some people don't know what's best for them. Noria. Are you going to graduate? Your father sent for a tea master from the city. Are you sure you're not coming with me? I have my duties here. No need to please the dead. - It's the living I care for. We've always had a tea master from our family here. You could study. See the world. I was raised to do this. I wish we could've left behind a different world. Dear Noria, we are made of the fluidity of water and the nearness of death. I still didn't want things to go like this. But you are strong and brave. I will always be proud of you. Heed these words: Don't show it to anyone. It might be the last of its kind. Guard it well. You're leaving already? Is it true what it says here? Give me your pod. Say nothing crucial in front of the pods or the soldiers. This is a place that doesn't exist. If there is pure water here, there has to be more elsewhere. That's dangerous. - What if I'm right? It's easy to drown in that hope. - We could save people... Even if there was, who would you tell about it? Whose hands would it fall into? Just a moment, please. I'm so proud of you. You will make a fine tea master. Be careful. Promise me. If you go, go after dark and by yourself. And don't mention it to anyone. Not a single soul, or it will be the death of you. I am a watcher of water. I am a servant of tea. I quench the thirst of the body and the mind. I shall not shackle that which grows nor cling to that which must crumble. I shall protect the weak and shelter those who are vulnerable. Mr. Taro is here to help with the water shortage. He demanded to join the ceremony. My official task is optimising water distribution. I make sure everyone gets their share. You think it's some kind of a strike force? You think Sanja likes Mikoa? - Yes. I heard that. Have some water. It tastes different. - Yes, it does. Don't tell anyone. NOT PURE If anyone hears this, we've failed. Don't let the army get a hold of this disc. We're a group of scientists from the Jansson expedition. We were analysing the waters of Mannfjellet and Reisa up north. Their microbe levels. They tried to stop us from revealing the truth. The soldiers chased us down and executed all but two of us. We ran south and hid. The tea master of a small village found us in the power plant. He is helping us hide. Dad got these from his own father. - The less he knows the better. The soldiers are coming. I'll continue later. This must be made public. There is pure water... Hey. Go back to bed. - I want to listen! No way. Back to bed. - No! Right now. The Jansson expedition. Grandpa protected them. Or his father. Did your father know about this? - I doubt it. We must be the first to hear this. It was pretty garbled. I knew there had to be pure water elsewhere. What do you mean "elsewhere"? - I mean... somewhere. Here people would kill each other for it. Maybe they would help each other. We need to find out more. - I need to work. Can't you ask the guy from your graduation ceremony? Isn't he some kind of water expert? He'll be at the bonfire tonight, right? You must be able to identify yourself whenever requested. What's that? A fox. I think. Mine's a lynx. What were they like? They were cats. I wish I could've seen a live animal. There are always new things to learn. Things you didn't know before. Come. You've visited a tea house before. Dad's family walked the path of tea. - Where? Down south, where lakes still existed. What's your real business here? "Optimising water distribution." Come on. I came to change things. Or at least to try. What things? - Water belongs to everyone. You believe there's still pure water somewhere? That's a dangerous idea. Changing things isn't? This major of yours... - Bolin. What? Sometimes people show only what they want you to believe. OPEN What's going on? "The increasing water crimes leave the government with no option but..." They cut the water off. "The army will provide the weekly water rations at the health centre." It was nearly done. You promised me. I lied, okay? How was yesterday? - Huh? You two danced the whole night through. I brought water for Minja. What will you drink? You don't even have enough for the ceremonies. Things can't go on like this. What can we do about it? World map. Mannfjellet. Reisa. "A slight change of weather, but still no rain." "The drought continues, and no visitors today either." "There is a shortage of water even in the best of times, but mostly people get by on their monthly quotas." "The number of charlatans has increased nevertheless." AT THE PLASTIC GRAVE. WANT TO COME LOOK FOR MORE DISCS? "Excessive use of water has been criminalised." "Times are getting tougher." "Quality of purified sea water dismal." "Not pure enough forte a ceremonies." "A stubborn fly has been disturbing the ceremonies all summer." "It won't remain unfettered, which is against its nature." "Water has no beginning and no end." "The stream merely grows, diminishes, and changes like life itself." "The crop from the irrigated areas is smaller each year." "This year locusts became extinct." "Water crimes are increasing." "The mean annual temperature has risen by one degree." "The villagers' plight is getting worse." "I ran into unexpected visitors. Runaways." "They told me they were scientists." "They were hiding in the abandoned water treatment plant." "I offered them tea, but that was all I could do." Hey. What are you doing here? Did you know this used to be a water treatment plant? I almost lied that I came here to look around... - But? I followed you. - Why? You're the most interesting thing around here. I heard about your father. My condolences. Thank you. I also lost my father when I was young. How did he die? It was the soldiers. It left me with a feeling that... Since then I've wanted to achieve something... ...big. I know what you mean. Dad always believed in me. More so than I did. It's almost beautiful. What happened in here? The world changed. Some say it happened by itself. Some believe humankind was responsible. How about you? - What? What are you doing here? Sanja, that friend of mine... She collects all sorts of things, and I help her to look for parts. Find anything? Does your work allow you to travel freely? Nobody's really free. How does it work, then? Can you negotiate with the soldiers? If you're ready to yield. How can you do that? If I need to negotiate, I don't have to be right. I do whatever benefits each of us the most. So you make compromises. Shouldn't a tea master be like water? It's not the same as giving up your principles. Hey! Stop that! I have a permit for those! Hey! Stop! What is this? - A water raid. What for? Stay out of this. A tea master is supposedly distributing extra water. And did you find anything? Well? Father trusted you. If you knew what I have to protect this village from... Who are you protecting? - I can't help it if people are selfish. People are trying to survive, and you call them selfish? Noria... Major. Can I have a word with you? Fine. Let's return to the headquarters. I might've yielded a bit. Hey! Have you joined the army? - Sanja... ...said yes. Said yes to what? Married? - Engaged. Soldiers get more water, right? - I can't make it on my own. It's better to be alone than lonely. What do you want? You don't have to. - I chose to. Sanja... What's wrong? Minja might not make it. She's really unwell, and I can't fix her. I don't know how to fix her. Present your ID. Your pod. Okay. Noria. Noria. Why can't you tell me where we're going? I know how we can help Minja. How long have you known about this? When dad died... ...he left me with information about this place. I brought water for Minja right away. Your father could have saved people. So could you. The spring is drying up. Nobody can own water, Sanja. The army can't know about this... ...or they'll capture it. This has to remain a secret. How is this different from what the army does? You said people would kill each other for this. So you get to decide who lives and who dies? I'm trying to help. - It's still wrong. I know! Are you sure about this? I'll try again. Whoever is listening, the soldiers captured us, the Jansson expedition. Only two of us remain. They are looking for us. Maybe it's all in vain and nobody can listen to this disc. I'm using old technology. Maybe the soldiers won't destroy it like they do with books, computers, all of our history, so they could control the future. Eight million people died of a killer bacterium. They planted it in the water. It was no accident. The Lost Lands up north. Eventually they will be habitable. Perhaps by the next generation. The water should be drinkable soon. The data recorded on this disc proves... How can you know if any of that is true? We'll take the discs to the university. Someone must know what to do with them. And how to share this. - We? You and I. If the government is trying to hide... Why can't you just share what you already have? They'll kill me if the spring is found. We can't let this slide. If there is pure water in the Lost Lands, people must know... What can we do about it? - Sanja! I need you. I can't do this alone. Come with me. Come on. Noria. Perhaps it's time for you to leave. Never mention this to me again. Press here. This is Major Bolin. Last night, the terrorists attacked the health centre. The number of victims is yet unknown. We've entered a state of emergency. We need to act together. A curfew between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. will be put into effect. The safety of each one of you is now priority number one. Together we will make it through this. Noria. Are you all right? I'm fine. What happened? I must tell you something. - Don't hold the ceremonies... Mum! I found out more about the old days. That information will change everything. Don't tell me more. You never know who's listening. Here or there. Is there anyone you can trust? I don't know what to do. That doesn't sound like you. Do you think that... ...dad was afraid of dying? I'm sure he was. He just kept it all bottled up. Just like you. There's somebody here. I need to go. Noria! Be careful. Come here to me. Did they catch those terrorists? I wouldn't believe everything Bolin says about the terrorists. Sometimes you have to make up your enemies. You're right. Soldiers don't need the health centre. Mum wants me to go live with her in the city. Will you go? I don't know. Maybe. How about the... ...tea masters' secret? You know, my father... He was also a watcher of water. Before the soldiers found out his secret. As soon as I tasted your tea, I knew there must be a place that doesn't exist in here. Have you told anyone? Have you? If you go, will someone stay to take care of things here? Water belongs to everyone. What is it? I have to go. Noria. You realise you're in danger, right? I can't do this now. Sanja's sister, she... She won't let me in. Sanja. Sanja. Hey. Sanja. Sanja. Sanja! It's all right. I've missed the ceremonies. But you need water for them to happen. I always thought you'd leave some day. And I hoped you would bring us with you. Now I just want you gone. Message to Taro. Hey... Maybe Noria was right. What? Maybe I'm better off alone. COME WITH ME. WE SHOULD DO THIS TOGETHER. Hey! What's going on? Did you get a helicarriage? - Where are you going? I'll tell you everything. You can look after the spring. Noria, listen to me. Calm down! I promised your father I would protect you. This cannot be traced. Carriage A5. You need to leave this place. Go. Go! Where are my discs? Without them, this is all in vain! We need to leave this place. Tell me where the spring is... Bolin tried to help me. - And you believed him? He was lying. That's all he does, no matter his promises. Tell me where the spring is so it won't fall into the wrong hands. What are you really here to do? Like I said, I'm here to change things. Or to keep things as they are? He who holds the water holds the power. You know that. Was anything you told me true? I didn't tell any lies. Unlike you. Who are you? What do you want? You only need to yield a little. Would life with me be so bad? I would have told you everything. What are these? Why are they so important? - Let go of me! What are you planning? I'll ask you one last time: where is the spring? Just give up and this will all be over. Commander Taro? Commander Taro! Go. Let's return to the HQ. Sanja? Hey, Sanja. Let's go. Let's go to my mum. We'll be safe there. You will die here. Sanja! You hear me? Dust and ashes. That's all that remains in this world. We have to go now. Mikoa blew the whistle on me. Come on. Code 207, return to the helicarriage. He said Sanja would face no consequences. I didn't want you to go. I didn't know Taro was a commander. They'll have me executed. Shoot me here. It has to look real. Mikoa. We need your uniform. And listen, this is important. You think they're already looking for us? We'll soon find out. CAPTAIN AINO VANAMO What? Take this. No! Take that train. I'm not coming. What will you do? The discs are gone. There's only one way to get evidence. Are you serious? It's suicide! If there's even the slightest chance of finding water... Then what? If people knew about it, they would act. These are not the only Lost Lands. What if... ...they have all been cleansed? This is way too big for us. - We've been lied to. Our water has been taken from us. Mum is a researcher, if I can find... ...evidence that the Lost Lands have been cleansed, that the water is safe to drink... - Noria. What's your plan? You need me. - That's what I've been saying. I mean right now. You can't fix this carriage. I miss Minja. Me too. What did you tell Mikoa? It's pure. Mum will go nuts when she sees this. Let's fill our water containers. What is it? Soldiers. It's Taro. Hide. What? Take this to my mum. Tell her that... - You tell her! Whatever happens, stay low. This is more important than either of us. I might make it out alive... ...but he would kill you. Trust me. This... This changes everything. I love you. Go! You came a long way just to get revenge. I underestimated you. You found about this place from those discs, right? It's nothing personal. Tell it to those who died in vain during the water wars. Someone had to unite the people and control the water. You can't own water! - No. Not if you're poor. - Why is nobody here? Why isn't this made use of? - It will be. Trust me. - But this is our water. So you can own water after all? It will all be futile anyway. This will expose your activities. Yes, that plan of yours. It's gone. - Sanja is on her way. We'll catch her. And I can't let you go. Unless you're ready to yield. I understand it now. I understand you. You exposed your father to the soldiers. Just to show you're better than him. He knew you are empty inside. And he would have forgiven you. He would have loved you. I would have loved you. That's the difference between you and me. You always do what you think will benefit you the most, and I can never be a part of that. How can you be so sure? This is all we have. So why not enjoy it while you still can? Because if this is all there is, we need to protect it. Sanja, you're alive! This world might be full of dust and ashes... ...but not devoid of hope. Isn't this worth fighting for? If they're lying to us about this... ...what else are they keeping from us?
