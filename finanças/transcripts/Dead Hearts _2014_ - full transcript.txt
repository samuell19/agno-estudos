(soft piano music) - [Narrator] Milton Mulberry, Jr. was going to die. Now you're probably thinking what a morbid way to start a story, but it's true. We all die. I will die, you will die. But in this story, and maybe in yours, death is just the beginning. Death was an all too familiar friend to Milton. In fact, it was his only friend. Milton Mulberry, Jr. was going to be a mortician. His father was a mortician. And his father's father was a mortician. A job that had been passed down for generations, like an old hand-me-down sweater, the Mulberry's were morticians. Milton had no choice in the matter. It was a certainty like death itself. (sighing) (blood splattering) - Hmm. - [Narrator] Milton Mulberry was different. All the kids in town could easily see it. All except one. Lola Littleton was blind and had been since birth. She liked Kung Fu, books on tape, and... (growling) (screaming) taxidermy. Milton Mulberry was in love. But so... was Harold Henderson. - Hey. - [Narrator] Harold was the first kid ever to come over Milton's house. (sniffling) Milton, from that day on, would always wish it was for a different reason. (dramatic music) - Oh! (grunting) - [Narrator] At 3:07 each day, Harold Henderson would kick the crap out of Milton. This continued seven days a week without interruption, including holidays. (grunting) (electronic beeping) (upbeat pop music) (grunting) (kick smacking) (punches smacking) (screaming) (kick smacking) Milton had just witnessed the fall of the most deadly and villainous eight-year-olds of all time. Wait. It couldn't be. It was. (bright horn music) This was the first time a girl had ever touched Milton. Her hands were soft. Milton would remember this moment for the rest of his short life. Geoffrey Chaucer once said love was blind. For Milton, this was true. Lola liked coming to the funeral home. She liked to touch the faces of the dead. She told Milton that their faces told the stories of their lives. In their wrinkles, in their scars, she would find tales of adventure, outbreak and love. She told Milton he was really lucky to have this job. And for the first time in his life, he agreed with her. (car doors slamming) (railroad signals ringing) On November 13th, John and Martha Littleton died in a car crash just outside of du kwon dojo. In her seven years of life, Lola had never once felt blind until today. (crying) (solemn trumpet music) The next day Lola left to live with her Uncle Tellyride in New York. (solemn trumpet music) Lola would never see Milton again for the rest of his life. Milton is heartbroken, would never love again. And so as I sadly stated at the start of our story, Milton Mulberry Jr. died no longer wishing to live amongst the living. He would return to the Mulberry mortuary and wait for his body to join him in death. (thunder clapping) At 78 years old, Milton was still waiting. He'd left the mortuary a total of six times in the last 60 years. (playful horn music) Death remained his only friend. (playful horn music) (sighing) (grunting) His family would have been proud. - Hmm, hmm. - [Narrator] Well, not that proud. - Hmm. - [Narrator] Milton longed for death, but his broken heart continued to beat. He was tired of taking care of the dead. So decided it was time to join them. (playful music) (screaming) (electricity buzzing) Milton Mulberry was dead. But as I told you, this was just the beginning. Milton had awoken six feet below the earth, confused and terrified. But not as shocked and terrified as Alegis Caesar, who up to this moment was rather enjoying his new job. (playful horn music) Alegis's heart stopped at exactly the same moment Milton realized he was missing something. (gasping) This was the reason Milton had returned. He had given his heart away. And now he just had to find the person who had taken it. The expression "listen to your heart" takes on a whole new meaning when it rests in someone else's chest. The road was long, but surprisingly animated. And soon Milton found himself outside his heart's door. (kids laughing) (knocking) - [Kids] Trick or treat! (laughing) - [Narrator] It had to be her. It was always her. Lola Littleton had a heart attack the day Milton died. His death saved her life. It's not often we get a second chance at love, a second chance at life. Milton wasn't going to waste it. Harold Henderson at 81 was still an asshole. Every day since her parent's funeral he'd been trying to win Lola's heart. He'd been failing for 73 years. But Harold didn't like to lose. And he was tired of getting rejected. (grunting) (punches thumping) (pumpkin thudding) (growling) (electronic beeping) (upbeat rock music) - Ho. (grunting) (kicks smacking) (punch smacking) (grunting) (punches smacking) At 77, Lola's Kung Fu was still in top form. - Yeah. - [Narrator] Milton's 78-year-old heart sadly was not. (grunting) (punches smacking) (grunting) - Ah! (flesh splattering) (screaming) (blood squirting) (grunting) (soft chime music) True love is the most powerful force in nature, a force that can rip flesh from bones and tear out a man's heart. It's the only thing worth fighting for. The only thing worth dying for. (horn music) Lola Littleton, like Milton, was dead. Now you're probably thinking what a morbid way to end a story, but it's true. We all die. I will die, you will die. (horn music) But in this story and maybe in yours, death... is just the beginning.
