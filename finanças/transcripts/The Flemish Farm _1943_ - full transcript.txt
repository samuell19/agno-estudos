(cymbal banging) (triumphant music) (triumphant music) (light music) - [Narrator] May the 27th 1940. Five battered machines were all that remained of the fighter squadrons of the Belgian Air Force. Hopelessly outnumbered in the air and forced back further and further towards the west, by this time they were operating from a farm near the Flanders cursed. Reports of the fighting were confused and no one knew exactly how near the enemy really were. (upbeat music) (indistinct chatter) - Turn that off somebody. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we have some bad news. The position is extremely grave. In a few hours the enemy may be here so we haven't much time. And Meckland, you'll mount guards and be ready to destroy all equipment in the event of a surprise attack. - Very good sir. - Ledoux. - [Ledoux] Sir. - You'll be responsible for seeing that all papers, except those in B and C files are destroyed. Before I explain the position to the men, there's something else. It's about our colours. If we are forced to capitulate, the Germans will demand that all regimental standards be surrendered to them. As you know, there are some names on ours. Pretty good names. In the last few weeks there have been others which ought to stand beside them. But they never will. I suppose I am the only one here who was present when we first received our colours. They were given to us by the late King Albert. There is of course no question of handing them over. And the high command have ordered that they should be destroyed. (faint thundering) Gentlemen, I've always carried out orders without question, and I shall do so now. That's all I have to say. Those of you having no other duties will please parade in half an hour. (ominous music) - About 100 meters out it shelves away steeply. Make sure you're beyond that. - Yes sir. (slow paced music) - Officers and men of the Air Force, in a few moments we shall salute our flag for the last time. Some of you may wonder why we don't try to fly to safety, but we can't risk it getting into enemy hands. Rather than that, we give it an honourable grave. Tonight, in this tragic hour of Belgium's history, we pledge ourselves to carry on the fight whenever and wherever it may be possible to do so. Trumpeter! (loud trumpeting) (light music) - Is that you Fernard? You didn't come with us. - No. - You think it of no importance that we bury our flag. - Of course it is. - Well we parade for orders at 4:30 in the morning. - I know. - Maybe you're planning to miss that too. - You've no reason to think that. - No? I should have thought a man who thinks less of his flag than of a tawdry little affair with a girl. - That's a disgusting thing to say. - All right, somebody's got to stay behind anyway. - Well I haven't said anything about staying behind have I? - I'm saying it for you. We've got 11 effective pilots and five kites. - So what will happen. - Now those have got planes will go on fighting with the French. - And the rest? - We'll surrender with the army. - I see. Have I got one? - Yes. You've got Lessart. He's staying with the men. - And you? - I'm lucky too. (melancholy music) (loud thundering) - It's getting light already. Nearly time for you to go. I want to cry but there's no tears left. It's an ache now, in my throat, my chest, the back of my head. - But you're going to believe aren't you? - In dreams? - No, in me. That I shall come back. - Things that are happening so horrible Fernard. Only the dreams seem real. I keep feeling it's only true for the rest of the world, not for me. I tell myself nothing can stop us being together. But I know in my heart we shall never see each other again. - But you must stop thinking like that. I shall find some way to come back to you, I promise you. - But darling you'll be flying. But don't you think about that? - Often. I weigh out my chances as we all do. At the moment, I'd put them at about 20 to 1 against. - Aren't you afraid of death? - No. I shall come through alright. - If I have a son I shall call him Fernard. - You still don't believe me do you? - Maybe one of those dreams like mine. - No. Most of us have premonitions. One way or the other. It's uncanny how often they're right. - Is that true? Is it really true? - It is. Being away from you, that'll be the worst part. I shall always be wondering. - My mother was here last time it came. When they left after four years, she was still here. - Four years. - Every morning when I wake up, every night when I go to bed I should say Fernard will come, Fernard will come. Oh my darling, you will won't you? (melancholy music) (trumpeting) - I'm afraid that's goodbye. Come on. Oh darling. - My handkerchief. - When I come back. - Fernard, you better forget it. - [Fernard] Forget what? - Do you realise how things are going? Canal hasn't stopped them, nothing stops them. - Well? - Well as I say you better forget it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh yes you do. That girl's in love with you. - And I with her. - Yes, I was afraid of that. - Why? - Why, because it's impossible. - Surely that's my worry isn't it. - Fernard don't be a fool. Tomorrow night she may be one side of the line and you the other. - Well Jean, you must understand it's not like that. - Nonsense, you've only been here a few days. - Oh what's time got to do with it? I tell you that's how it is! Well you go on, I'll be over later. - Just as you like. - After the breakthrough at Carter the Panzer Division swung north towards the coast. We've just learned that they reached it yesterday afternoon. Somewhere about here. That means of course that we are completely cut off. Our armies after covering the withdrawal now stand along this narrow strip. It is packed with refugees, making any movement impossible. I have no more reserves, they can get no more supplies, at their backs they have the sea. The king has therefore asked that hostilities should cease. No other course is possible. There will not be criticism, incrimination, but you have no cause to be ashamed. All that human determination can do has been done. And it is your duty to make this understood by your going. Is that clear? - Yes sir. However, we don't yet know the exact area occupied by the enemy between us on the French, but you'll cross it at 10 mile intervals and get what photographs you can of his 10 concentrations. Duclos. - Sir. - You'll lead the squadron. Make for the out near Beauvais. I hope it's still ours. Make sure before you land. Those who stay will destroy what we can before the enemy arrives. I think that's all. Anyone any questions? Very well, get going as quick as you can and good luck to you. (loud screeching) (loud explosions) Get going! Get those planes off the ground! (loud exploding) - Get in mine! - No you go! - Get in mine I tell you! Hey, give me a hand. - Hey stop that little fool! Get her back under the cover! - Fernard! (triumphant music) - [Narrator] After fighting for a while with the French the survivors came over here and joined the RAF. Duclos and Matagne were posted to different squadrons. And for the time being lost touch with one another. Then one day when Duclos returned from an operational flight and went to his office... - Well, this is wonderful! It's good to see you again. - Hello Jean. - Well, sit down. Cigarette? - No thanks. - Flight was telling me you had a forced landing. - No, I came down on purpose. There's something I want to get off my chest. - Fernard, before you begin, I suppose I behaved pretty badly. I'm sorry. - You remember that night at the farm? You were mistaken. - I expect I was. I'm sorry. Can't we leave it at that? - No, I'm afraid we can't. Just because you came back and find me leaving Tresha, you assumed I'd been with her all the time. - And hadn't you? - No I hadn't. I'd been doing a job for the old man. - What do you mean? What job? - Burying the flag. - Burying the flag? I'm afraid I don't get it. - I'm not joking. - Well I may be crazy, but I seem to remember that when we buried the flag the one person not present with Lieutenant Matagne. The standard banner. - You only thought you were burying it. All that sack contained was a little sand and some of Lessarts underwear. - But there was a full parade, a salute was given. What was all that for then if it wasn't for the flag? - It was for the flag. It was held at the right time but not at the right place, that's all. - Why? - So that later if anyone talked, the enemy would be put off the scent. - And you say you buried it? - Yes. In a field on the farm. The flag in one place and the line in another. When you saw me I just put the tools away. - But why you? Why not Termicken or one of the senior officers? - Of course I'd been about the farm some time the old man thought I'd attract less notice if I was seen. - Well couldn't he trusts us then? - Of course. He said the fewer people who knew about it, the fewer were likely to get into trouble. - Why are you telling me all this now? - Partly because I don't much care about being thought of rat. And partly because I need your help. - In what way? - I thought we might have a shot at getting it back. - Hmm. Yes, that's quite an idea. They'd never give permission. - Not to me. They'd take more notice of you. - It certainly is an idea. Well it seems I owe you a bigger apology than I thought. And this time I mean it. - Forget it. - Boy oh boy, does this put new life into me. Let's gonna have a drink and talk it over. - If ever one needed an excuse. - That flag won't look too good will it after six months in the ground. - I think it'll be all right. It's in the shell case. - Well you certainly had the laugh at us. - I wasn't feeling much like laughing. - No. Hi Chuck. Have you heard from her? - She was alive three months ago, that's all I know. - It must be pretty bad for you worrying what's happening over there. - It's hell. You see, we were married. - You were? - Yes. The day before you arrived at the farm. - Then we must fix it. - [Narrator] But it didn't work out as they planned. The next day saw the beginning of the Battle of Britain and it was not until some weeks later that Duclos found time to go and look up Matagne. - Yes he was here, arrived August the 5th. When did you last see him? - In August, the 9th. - Was he a particular pal of yours? - Well yes. - I'm afraid you've got a bit of a shock coming to you Duclos. He met it the day after you saw him. He's bedded at the Catholic Church of Harridge. Let me see, there was a letter. I think perhaps you better see it. Oh Adams, that letter they came the other morning for Lieutenant Matagne. - Yes sir. - Where is it? - With his kit sir in the store. - Let me have it will you? - Yes sir. - Just a minute. Perhaps you'd like to go over his things yourself? - Oh thank you. - Eddles, take squad leader Duclos to the store will you? - Sir. - Well if there's anything else I can do for you, you'll let me know won't you? - Thank you sir. (solemn music) - Will you just call into the office when you finish sir? - Thank You sergeant. (sombre music) (light upbeat music) - Oh not that one. - I like it. - But you tell me the other day-- - I still like it. What are you doing tonight? - Me? I'm on duty. - What about you? - I'm afraid I'm dining with some-- - Okay okay. George. - Sir. Ring up the bag of nails and book a table for one. - For one sir? - Yes one, a half of two. With Lessart. The son the son of our commanding officer. He was with his father in golf three months ago. And he says the major is living there now as a civilian. - Do I understand that he came to you and volunteered all this? - Well, no sir, not exactly. When I saw the name the Lessart among those that had come over, I wondered if there's any connection and naturally looked him up in the hope that he'd have some news of the major. - And you asked him a few questions I suppose? - [Duclos] Yes sir. - What you really mean is that you pumped it out of him. - Well sir-- - I hope that's what you mean. Because if not, he's been guilty of a serious offence. As a matter of fact, Major Lessart has been doing a very good job for us over there, but if people go about advertising the fact, his activities may stop a rather abruptly. Do you follow me? - Yes sir. - Well I'll, I'll think it over Duclos. - [Duclos] Thank you sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye sir. Shall I keep my toothbrush ready packed sir? - Why? - Well they say there's a shortage over there. - Very well. - Thank you sir. - Strange what magic there is in symbols. Flags and so forth. All through history men have shown determination to die for them. A few couldn't have been more determined than that young man. Well I suppose the least we can do is give him a plane and a parachute. And get me the Air Minister will you? - Yes sir. - And Group Captain Bradshaw. (light perky music) - I thought you are never coming. - Well it doesn't seem much a surprise to you sir. - I've known you were in Belgium since four o'clock last Tuesday afternoon. - But I only landed that morning. - A tribute to my information service. Well how are you my dear fellow? Because I didn't faint it doesn't mean I'm not damn pleased to see you. - I'm pretty glad myself sir. - Sit down, make yourself at home. I have a hell of a lot of questions I want to ask you. - So have I. - We'll have to take it in turns in three hours stretches. Oh and no sirs by the way, they'll have to pop out when you don't bump them. In any case, I'm a civilian now with command of about half a brigade. - Yes, your son told me. - You've seen him? - Yes, he said to give you his love and to tell you that he'd begun flying. - Flying? That's fine. Flying. Now tell me what is your program? - To get the flag. - How did you know? - Matagne, he told me before he was killed. - You know, I rather liked the idea of this. If it didn't involve so many people I'd go with you. - Well if you can tell me exactly where it is-- - I can't. - You mean you don't know? - I know it's somewhere near the group of elm trees at the back of the farmhouse. I left the exact spot to Matagne. Wait a bit, there was a girl. - She was his wife you know. - Well perhaps she can help. - Well if she can't I'm sunk. How does one set about getting into the prohibited area? - You can apply for a permit from Gestapo headquarters. Personally I've always found it simpler to deal direct with the man who prints them. I think we better go down to the cafe and talk there. - But it's full of officers. - That's right. So much safer than being alone in a flat. (light music) There was a time when they made this of acorns. Now they found a substitute. (chuckling) Take it easy. - Duclos. (speaks foreign language) You never wanted a brigade dinner. Sorry if I gave you a scare. I was only making sure you found his house flat alright. - Just shows how mistaken one can be. - What news from Brussels? - I'm afraid we were right about air police. He seems to have been spending a lot of his time at the Gestapo headquarters. - He'll have to be checked. I'll keep an eye on myself for a day or two. Sorry to talk shop. - I was wondering while we're waiting for this permit, if it'll be possible with me to see someone in Brussels. - Depends who it is. Not family. - My mother. - Well, he's the Brussels expert, what do you think? - You'll see the families of all the people that left the country are watched in case they return. - Couldn't you arrange for them to meet somewhere? Quite casually I mean. - You have to be very careful. Perhaps in the park. There's a seat just inside the north gate. If you happen to be sitting there reading a newspaper... (bells ringing) - Hello mother. - My darling boy. It's like a miracle. You've been ill. - Oh it was nothing. Tell me about yourself. How have you been living. - It's not important. - Yes it is. Do you get enough food? - We have enough to keep the light in us. Oh Jean. Just to see you and know that you're alive. - But haven't you been having my letters? - A year ago I had one, from England. - I've just come from there. Jean, what does it mean? - I got a job to do. But you mustn't ask em what it is. - It doesn't matter what it is. All that matters is that you're here beside me. So near that I could put my arms around you. Like I did when you were a little boy. Do you remember when you tried to use the sign? - Mother. - You'll go back to England? - [Jean] Yes. - So-- - Directly I've done my job. In a few days time if all goes well. - Then I shan't see you again. - Not until the war is over mother. Or until we drive them out. - Pray god it happens quickly. Good people are dying every day for saying it will. - I can't tell you what it was like wondering about you. Are you afraid in the area of Carmona? - Yes. A bit disappointed when they don't. I wonder if I could just... (ominous music) - I'm afraid we'll have to go mother. - But Jean, we haven't even-- - I know, but it isn't safe here. Give me your hand. I'll find a way of letting you know somehow. - Take care of yourself. - Don't worry. I think you better go first. - Goodbye. (speaks foreign language) - Sorry I'm late. There's been a little trouble. - Trouble? - No, not about this. Oh there you are. That'll get you at the coastal belt. Here's your new identity. - [Jean] Pieter Martens engine Qatar, age 28. - Here's his family history. Rehearse those details a bit on the way out there so they become pat, and then burn it. - You say there's been some trouble. - One of their agents has been shot. There'll be reprisals. You better get out of it before the fun begins. If you don't find it, don't hang about. Hmm, that's better. A week ago it sounded like an automatic riveter. - Well I'm learning. (both speak foreign language) (determined music) - Halt, forbidden zone! - I've got a permit. (ominous music) - Here, have a cigarette? - Yes. Thanks. - What is this urgent family business? - I've got to see my cousin at the farm over there. - What for? - He owes me some money. - He owes everybody money. Report here on your way back. - Fine. (determined music) (clanking) - Well? - I don't know what it is. - Three times now the ploughing has been stopped and you don't know what it is. Well I know what it is, sabotage. We put him up against the wall for that. (determined music) (loud gun firing) (creaking) (loud firing) - I can't make it out. It's only lately it's been like this. - Well, the captain will be coming here tomorrow. Better start making your will. - Bend down, get down. Pretend to open the engine. Did you put this thing wrong? - Me? Merciful saints, I've been trying to put it right. They're gonna shoot me if I don't. - Sounded like ignition to me. Have you looked at the distributor? - No, I never meddled with that. - Shh, be quiet. - Who are you? - Do you remember the night the planes were stationed here? - Planes? - [Jean] May the 27th 1940. - That was a night the general came down in the oat field. - [Jean] Yeah, and I shot him down. - Ah, a young chap named Duclos did it? - I am Duclos, you know that name? - My cousin. How did you get this? - [Jean] He lent it to me. He said you could put me up here. - How do I know that you-- - Now look, you want me to fix this? - Yes, yes, go on. - Then you'll tell them I'm your cousin. - Yes. - And remember, I've come here to collect some money that you owe me. - What? - Well, that'll be what we tell them. I had to give some reason to pass over the control. That's your trouble. Axle grease. - But how in the name of heaven can axle grease got in there? - Only if someone put it there? - Tresha. There's something about that field, she didn't want it ploughed up. - She didn't? - No. I'll take the hide off her for this. I'll teach-- - Fix that it never goes again? And you'll keep calm and listen to me. She did this because she knows there's something buried in that field. Something belonging to my regiment. And I've come here to get it. - Mother of God. You'll get us all shot. - Not if you keep your wits about you. - Where is Tresha now? - Over the bow now. - All right, when I finish I'll go and talk to her. We'll soon get this thing going. (crying) - What's the matter? Jean Duclos. - You must forget that. Now I'm your cousin Pieter Martens. - I don't understand. Where have you come from? - England. - Has Fernard come with you? - I'm afraid not. - But you have news of him? It's bad news. - It was nearly a year ago now. During the Battle of Britain. - Did he speak of me? - Yes, the night before he died. He told me you were married. If he'd lived he would have come over with me. - You killed him. - Tresha he was shot down. - His plane was destroyed and you forced him to go. What right did you to decide that he must die? - I felt he didn't know his own mind. That he'd want to go on flying. It wasn't easy to think with shells coming over and planes to get off the ground. I only did what I thought was best for him. - Best for him. But for you he'd be here now. - Tresha, I've got to ask you something. You can talk about it later. - Fernard's gone. - [Jean] What time to those soldiers come back? - Well most Saturdays it's around 11. They go to draw their pay and then tip the better part of it down their necks. - What about the old boy over there? - What about him? - He's listening. - Him listening? Nah, he hasn't heard anything for 20 years. - Well, I think I'll go and talk with Tresha. - You won't get anything out of her. There's a (speaks foreign language) Takes after her mother. Expected to be a bit upset wouldn't you? Hearing that young chap had been killed. - She's upset. - Not her. If she was she'd be crying her eyes out. She does it often enough. Just look at her, never a tear all evening. - Tears come afterwards. - Are you telling me I don't know my own daughter? Well I'm telling you to watch out. She's mad at you. - We'll see. - Ah, you'll see all right. Now my other girl that went to Brussels, you got some sense out of her. But this is a dark one. You mark my words. - Leave them, leave them. - Tresha, the soldiers are only way for tonight. I must ask you again, tell me where that flag is hidden. - Please, I don't feel like talking. - I've come from England to get it. - Why? Why risk your life for a piece of cloth? - It's not just a piece of cloth. It's what it stands for. It represents a belief, a faith. - To risk a life for a human being or to save your home, that I can understand, but this... - Tresha, when I came to the village I saw the church. I was told that when the soldiers put their guns in there 18 people were shot for trying to throw them out. That's true isn't it? - Yes. - Because that church stood for something they believed in, they went in with knives and pitchforks against machine guns and hand grenades. - Do you despise that? - This is different. - Is it? Don't we all need some visible sign of our faith? A church, a crown, a banner. If they stood for something you really believed in, would you stand by and see them desecrated by people you despised? I wouldn't and I'm certain Fernard wouldn't. - We don't know what he'd do. All we know is that he's dead. That last night together we buried the flag. - For me, it's his grave. - Tresha, it was Fernard now who wanted to come. - You're only using his name to get what you want. - No, he'd set his heart on it. And if you won't do it for me, well won't you do it for him? - Oh leave me alone. (slow paced music) (crying) - What have you been doing? - Thinking. - Thinking? There's no time for that sort of nonsense with a kid yelling his lungs out. - [Tresha] Where's Jean Duclos? - How do I know? He went out. (ominous music) - All right I'm ready. - Ready? - You shall need a shovel and pickaxe some sacks to put the earth on. Nine, it's exact, it must be right. - If it's as deep as this, the plough would have run over it. - That's it! (triumphant music) - Let's get rid of this. - If we meet anyone going back we've been looking for a calf. No one got out before. - As long as we both say the same thing. - Listen! (faint engine running) - Soldiers. - They're early. There'll be someone on duty until I think they think the Corporal's asleep. - Now you go back, I'll stay here. - Come by the orchard. There'll be a man near the barn right in front of the house. - All right, you better give me that. - What do you think you were doing? - One of the calves got out in the field. - Then why are you running this way? - To catch my father, I can't catch it alone. - Hey you, get a light on that field! You're quite sure it was a calf? - Of course. - What is it? - I thought I saw something! - Switch it off and get the torch's! Double down there some of you! - Perhaps we better leave it til the morning. - Oh no, we'll soon round him up. You come with us. (ominous music) - [Jean] Oh, I'm sorry I'm interrupting. - On the contrary. I've been waiting for you. - Waiting for me? - May I ask where you've been? - Yes, I've been helping mademoiselle Tresha catch the calf that got loose. - And did you catch it? - No-- - You left her to do it alone? - Some of your men are helping. You see I'm not much time, I want to talk to-- - To your uncle. - My uncle? - Your cousin I mean. May I see your papers? - Yes, certainly. - Eyes gray. Just come forward a little. I still said blue, maybe it's the light. Engine fitter. Show me your hands. Earth? - I came a cropper jumping a ditch in the dark. - When you were running? - After the calf. - What's the name of your firm? - England Franks. - How long have you been there? - Nine years. - You're 24? - 28, it says there. - What's the name of your Foreman? - Hilda. - You don't talk much like a fitter. How long are you staying here? - Until the morning. - What are you taking with you? - I don't understand. - Well, that's easily checked. The ploughing will be finished before midday. - Very good. Before you came in-- - Shh. What were you saying? - He went through all of the things in your case. It's lucky she didn't tell you where to find that flag. - Yes. Isn't it. And don't forget, if anything goes wrong you know nothing about it. - Nothing will go wrong. - You're very confident. - Yes. - Seems to run in the family. - [Soldier] What are you taking out with you? - Only this. - Bring it down here. Weren't you gonna get some money from your cousin? - That's right. - Where is it? - He hasn't got any. The soldiers have eaten all his stock. - Hmm, we don't see much of it. What's inside? - Two calves. - [Soldier] What else have you got? - Only the calves for Captain Scheldheimer. You know I'd never take anything out without a permit. - We'll have a look all the same. All right. Wait a minute. (ominous music) - What is it, money or rifles? - Neither. - Rubbish. Have you examined this? - [Soldier] Yes sir. - Take the girl in the hut and search her. You've got something here somewhere. What's in that box? - My baby. - Fetch it down. - There's nothing there and he's asleep. - I said take her away and search her. What are you waiting for? All right, put it back. Well? - [Narrator] Nothing sir. (ominous music) - Where are you taking him? - To the station. - Very well. (triumphant music) - You follow that path and when you come out of the wood through the field to the left. - A lot of people will be thankful to you for this. - Last night I behaved very badly. I'm sorry. Goodbye. - I want you to send these off for me. Send them by different routes will you? I have no doubt I shall be labelled a Jewish communist agitator. And I'd like our own people to have the facts. They can print them if they think fit. You'll see to it for me? - But sir, it's unthinkable. They all look to you. - This is not the time for sentiment. Atkins knew too much about me and I've no doubt he passed it on. I've become a danger to my friends and I'm better out of the way. The best service you can do is to help substantiate my guilt. - But I can't do that. - You can and you must. The organisation has got to go on. - The Gestapo will never believe that you did it. - They'll be only too ready to believe. The hostages will be released, they'll be glad enough to save their faces and not have to admit another failure. I'd like a few minutes alone. (tires screeching) - Him, that one, and those two there. Get 'em out quick. - Hello Duclos. - [Duclos] The SS were downstairs. They were taking people out of the cafe. - I know. Oh, did you have any luck? - [Duclos] Yes, I've got it. - That's all right then. Duclos, I hate to seem inhospitable, but this place is likely to be searched within the next hour or two. So the sooner you're on your way the better. There's a train at 7:30 and there's something in this I'd like you to look at. Not now, when you get on the train. I'm sorry I haven't time to hear how you got on. - Well there's nothing much to hear. The main thing is I've got it. - Yes. Well goodbye Duclos. - Goodbye. - If you see my boy, you might tell him that I was thinking of him on, what's the date today, the 10th? On the 10th of September. Will you remember that? - Yes I will. - I always seem to be hurrying off like this, but I have an appointment at six. - Goodnight sir. (slow paced music) - Mr. Lessart, I must ask you-- - Sorry, I can't. - Oh I won't keep you. It's about the Vineburger girl, the eldest one. I suppose you heard about the disgraceful business at the Hotel in Bristol the other night? - I'm so sorry I can't-- - But do realise that she walked across the entire width of the lounge to the table where the German officers were and sat down with them. Of course she said it was only to try and get some information about her brother. You remember, the one who went to (music too loud). (melancholy music) (indistinct chatter) (loud whistling) - Yes? - Is everything all right sir? - See they keep quiet in the front, I want to get some sleep. - Yes sir. (melancholy music) (loud whistling) (grinding) - Come on, break it up. Get a move on. - What's that you got there? - Oh a bit of the old drawing room curtains. - You know that fella? - Good evening. - Evening. Generally go this way? - No, not always. - Long on the job? - A couple of weeks. - Digs in town I suppose. - Yeah. - What do you do with yourself in the evenings? - Why? - I just thought you might have a drink somewhere. You ever go to the Cafe Bass? - No, I haven't been there lately. - I don't suppose you have. It was destroyed in 1918. Turn round, we're going back. (loud gun firing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (light music) - Ricardo? - Yes. - They told me to come here. - Why? - They said you'd help me to get across the frontier. Well, can you do it? - If your papers are good enough you'll get across without any help from me. - I should be searched. - Everybody's searched. - Listen, there's something I've got to take across with me. - [Ricardo] Where is it? - Here. - Let's see it. You'll never get that through. They're stripping everyone down to their boots. - I brought it 600 miles and I'm not gonna give it up now with only two miles to go. - They're looking for something special. Something that's supposed to have come from Belgium. That'll be about 600 miles wouldn't it? - Well? - And there's a big reward offered. - Well why don't you claim it if you think that's what they're looking for. - I'll do as I please about that. I don't like them or their money any more than you do. - You mean there's another way of getting it across? - There may be. I can't say until I've seen my sister-in-law. She lives on the other side. Mind you, I don't say it'll work. If it doesn't, you won't live very long. - I'll take a chance. - All the same, you better put it away somewhere. Just now a flag's a dangerous thing to have around. (light music) (suspenseful music) If you get past the guard on the bridge, take the road to the right. My sister's place is just over that hill. - [Narrator] Halt! - [Ricardo] Keep that sentry in the hut as long as you can. I'll stay until I see the dogs cut across. (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] Halt, your papers. (ominous music) In the Hut. (ominous music) (loud gun firing) - Is the passenger here? - Not yet. - [Male] But I'm ready to leave. - Well I say he's not here. - Yes, but I gotta deliver these by nine. - Are you expecting me? - Come in Monsieur. I have some soup waiting for you. - Have you got the parcel? - No. - Well where's the dog? - He hasn't come Monsieur. - I've got to go back. - [Male] I'm not gonna wait for that. - Leave it Monsieur. Go with Ari while you have the chance. - It may be four or five weeks before I'm back here. - You have been lucky to get through Monsieur. One can get other dogs. - But not the parcel. - Is your parcel of more importance than your liberty? - Yes. - Well, I'm going, you please yourself. - You will wait for him. - But I can't, I'll get into trouble! - I said you will wait for him! You say you had a breakdown! - Does this thing work? - After fashion. - Can I borrow it? - Of course. I expect it needs cleaning. - I'll be back. - I'll give you a half an hour, not a minute longer! (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - If they don't come back before dark, we'll go over. There's something moving higher up there. (loud gun firing) (suspenseful music) Top of the ground between the wall and the dog. Directly he shows himself, let him have it. There he goes. (loud gun firing) Did you get him? - I think so. (loud gun firing) - [Narrator] Considering what it's been through it doesn't look too bad. A few weeks later someone else brought back this little lion here which kind of completes the job. - [Narrator] Brought it back from Belgium to me? - That's right. - You talk about Belgium as if it were Brighton. - It's not as difficult as you'd think. - Not to talk about. I was thinking of those who actually went. - Excuse me butting in, but I think they're ready over there. - So they are. All right Ledoux. Oh Jean, I want you to meet Farley and Hardwicke. - How did you do? - Bet you can fix them up with seats. - Yes, of course. - Well, if you'll forgive me, I'll see you after parade. - We've just been hearing all about this flag business. - Oh yes? - Old Vanderbelt's quite a storyteller. You didn't know, you'd think he might have been over there himself. - He has. He's the one who went to fetch the lion. - You don't say. - Well let's move on then, shall we? - I give in to your keeping the flag of the regiment of the Belgian Air Force. (triumphant music) - That's the funny thing about this war, you'll never know who you're talking to. I dare say the bloke that fetched the flag is quite an ordinary little fella too. - Yes. (light music) - I didn't quite catch your name. - Duclos. - Duclos. (light music)
