Shut down Carlos, took home 250,000. He's worth it! You're the boss. If you say he's worth it, then he is. Watch out! The government of Kunlang announced today that an oil reserve worth billions was recently discovered in the Menglong Valley region, roughly 100 km north of the already operational No. 2 well at Longhua. - Engineers... - Sorry! Currently, engineers from Xiahua Energy and Imax Oil have begun a second round of prospecting as they prepare for the upcoming bidding process. Journalist, Kunlang News I'm sorry. That hurts! You're Chinese? Sorry, I didn't know. Never mind. I'm running late for an interview. I don't have time for your slow hands. Thank you. Captain Dee! Any truth to the rumors that terrorist groups are threatening to attack if the government doesn't stop the bidding process? Mr. Lu Ziming, come here. Okay, everybody. This is Mr. Lu Ziming, our security expert from China. He is very experienced and respected. With this man here, our work will be like a walk in the park. He will answer your questions. - Mr. Lu, can you... - Mr. Lu, please answer the question. Mr. Lu Ziming, can you answer my question? Excuse me. - Mr. Lu. - Have a latte. - Mr. Lu. - Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu. Hello, Mr. Lu. I'm Mo Bai from Kunlang News Network. How are you planning to secure the upcoming bidding process? You were pretty rude back there. I'm sorry. It's fine. Hey, Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu. Please. Captain Dee's Bodyguard Leon? Mr. Lu. It's time to go. Leon, you're alive! I can't believe it's really you. Why didn't you call me? I've been looking for you. Leon... What's wrong? What happened to you? Let's go, Mr. Lu. We don't have time. Give me your number. Let's meet up after this job. Sure. Sure. Welcome. Captain. How are you? Thank you for coming. Kunlang's Minister of Energy, General Manager of Imax Oil, USA Excuse me. Mr. Liu. - Hi. - Hello, old friend! Thank you for coming. It warms the heart to see you. General Manager, Xiahua Energy, China Thank you. It really means a lot. It cheers me up to see how much Kunlang has changed. Mr. Lu, I know about you. The flying sniper. There should be a prize for what you do. You're a legend. A real artist. Don't chew so much betel nuts. You have too much energy. Have you confirmed the status of your men? All units, report your status. Copy. It's all clear. It's all clear. Standby. The situation is normal. We have men at all key points. T-back or S-shape. I know you see the ass down there. I like the big tits girl. So serious. Well, hello, everyone. We're happy to see you. I'm here to represent Kunlang Government. We would like to thank China Xiahua Energy for helping our country grow its energy industry. Menglong girls are awesome. Don't you think so? I think this topic is not appropriate. Take it easy, Mr. Lu. This is not a war. For me, every job is a war. Send someone down to control that girl. Which one? Red scarf. She's helping the terrorists. Who? You. Of course. Fuck. Gosh. They did it. The terrorists. They shot an official. It's chaos. There has been a shooting at the conference. A Kunlang official has been hit. His condition is unknown. An eyewitness saw the injured assassin head into the woods. - The army is currently searching for... - The assassin was a Chinese man in his thirties. Security on-site responded with fire, but the suspect fled deep in the valley. The assassin is likely ex-military. He used a modified sniper rifle in the attack. No other suspects have been identified yet. Over there. Wait. He's gone. Go back. Over there. Hello? Is anybody here? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Where are you guys? We have confirmed the identity of the shooter. He is Lu Ziming. The Chinese security expert. The victim was an important member of the Kunlang government. And we believe he was supported by Chinese interests... It's a lie! Lu Ziming is innocent. Leon. - It's a setup! - Leon. It's a setup. Okay. Sit down, please. Sit down, please. Let's continue. I never saw anyone try to cut a rope with a bark before. Hey. What do you want? I'm just nobody. Let me go. Please. I promise I won't say anything. You look Chinese. Talk your own language, will you? Yes. My parents were Chinese. I just grew up here. I really love my real motherland. Here, have some Chinese barbecue. There's a snake. If I were you, I'd come back to the fire and get some food. You don't want to be alone in the forest at night. I just wanted to get my camera. Mr. Anderson, I'd like to make friends with a man like you. Cheers. Just three million. Mr. Anderson, it seems we are short. Can you please explain? Captain, it's easy. This project has not been secured yet. We have to wait until we sign the contract. And then I will give you the remaining two million. Okay? Xiahua is dirty. They sent Lu Ziming to kill our official. The project can only be yours. Is it necessary to wait for the contract? I understand, Captain. But Lu Ziming got away. What if, because of that, some problem occurred along the road? Tell me. I must remind you, Mr. Anderson. This is my kingdom. No one escapes and no one questions the king. My dear captain, you misunderstood me. I'm here to help. This is Cara. I brought her here to track down our Chinese friend. And she's perfectly built for this task. Really? Yes. Nice girl. So beautiful. Captain. Leon is here. Leon, have you forgotten who saved your life? I'm very disappointed in you. Captain, he was my partner. I know him. There is no way he did this. If I say he's the killer, he is the killer. I see, Captain. Good. I know he was your partner. Let's talk later. Have some. This guy loves this stuff. What? You're not hungry? I don't take food from killers. Why did you do it? Because I was hungry. Not that. Why did you kill that Kunlang official? That wasn't me. Well, killers don't usually call themselves that. Are you thirsty? What is this? It's awful! Bamboo leaf tea. It is locally sourced and removes toxins. Drink up. It's good for you. What's that? My sock. Your what? You wrung this out of your darn sock? Yes. It's a great emergency water filter. It's pure cotton. You... This is some nonsense! Be quiet. Don't move. You're sleeping here tonight. What about you? I'll admit, you don't look like a killer. Hey, I'm talking to you! So rude. So what if you're handsome? Target is located. He is 500 m. Nine o'clock. Captain. Go. Draw them over there! What are you doing? Don't do it. He's not a threat to you anymore. This is war. If you don't kill him, he'll kill you when he gets the chance. Don't do it. Kneel! Son of a bitch. I will find you. Fuck! Lu Ziming! What are you doing? You're bleeding again. This is not good. We need to get help. Let's go to Captain Dee. I interviewed him before and we got along well. He'll believe me. I'm sure of it. Where did you come from? I... That's not important. What's important is to find Captain Dee and explain everything. I was making footprints. Making what? What are you talking about? Who cares about your stupid footprints! I believe you didn't do it. There must be a misunderstanding. Don't worry. I'll explain everything to him. Are you done? Yes, I'm done. I'll go, you stay here. A search party will find you soon enough. Stop following me. Lu Ziming! You can't leave me here! I want to help! Lu Ziming! Lu Ziming! Are you all right? Hang in there, Lu Ziming! Hang in there! Look! Let's go. Just a little further. Be careful. Sit down! You're burning up! Go get the first aid kit. First aid kit. This is Radio News Chinese with a news update. Captain Dee will spare no effort to catch the assassin. Because the assassin is of Chinese descent, Xiahua Energy's bid in the oil field tender has been put on hold. This case seems to have cost Xiahua this project and tarnished its reputation in Southeast Asia. An American named Leon Miller, who stormed into a press conference to claim that the army is trying to frame Lu Ziming, has been charged with disturbing the peace and is facing deportation. There's no first aid kit. You need a hospital. You'll die out here. It's too late for that. Is there any alcohol? Alcohol? Sure! Red wine, beer, liquor, which one do you want? Get a pair of tweezers and a mirror. Okay. Here. Are you going to extract the bullet? It's deep. Help me! Me? No. I can't! Hurry! I'm sorry. It's fine. Approaching the target, over. I know you didn't do it. Ziming! Freeze! Where is he? Who? There's no one else here. Don't play. Was that Lu Ziming? He is not a killer. I have proof. Look. Bring me the proof. Clean up everything else. Roger. What did he say? He said you know too much. You have to die. What? Sorry, the captain pays dollars. Do you smoke? It's done. Are you with Captain Dee as well? No. I see. You're with them. I'm taking you to the Kunlang Government. Drop your gun. I'll release the pictures, so everyone will know the truth. Imax must have bought off Captain Dee to get Xiahua removed from the bid. With this evidence, we'll blow their plot wide open. I'm leaving Kunlang tomorrow. Before I go, you must deliver the files to someone. He'll know what to do. Local authorities have confirmed the assassination of a Kunlang official at a public ceremony earlier today. The key suspects involved in the murder have been named as a Chinese national, Lu Ziming, and a local resident of Chinese descent, Mo Bai. The wanted pair are on the run and are believed to be armed and dangerous. Authorities urge the public to remain vigilant and report any suspected sightings to the police immediately. Lu Ziming is gone. Are you happy now? What are you looking at? Mind your business. You need us. You know him. What else can you do? Like you said, I know him. I'm sure he'd come to find me. And when he does, I will keep my promise to the captain. The site has been compromised. Don't stop. Get out of there. Keep going. Hello? Mr. Miller, this is Eagle Fishing Utensils. Your order has arrived. You can pick it up when you have time. I can't leave the house right now. Can you deliver it? I'm sorry. We don't do delivery. You'll have to pick it up in person. Okay. I'll make an excuse for my family. As you know, I spend a lot of money on that stuff. I don't want my family to find out. Got him. Rooftop. Across the street. Are you at the store now? Go. Move. No, I still have two more orders to process. Then let's agree on a time and a place. I'll come to you. At 12:45 p.m. I'll be in the main hall of Ananda Temple. Fuck. I told you, you couldn't catch him. What? Look at you! A piece of shit. After this fucking mess, I'm going to do things my way. Alone. Fuck you. Captain. I know everything. Don't fail again. Yes, sir. Can we trust Leon? I only want results. Yes, sir. You haven't changed at all. I'm sorry I got you into this. Quit the nonsense. You'd do the same for me. Shit. It's not here. Let's go. This SD card contains the truth about this case. Help me get it out. This is 250,000 dollars. It's the payment for the last job. I'm afraid you're too late. Is it because of the explosion? Come with me. I'll take you somewhere safe. Ziming, the captain's men are on their way. You have to get out of there. I've caused you enough trouble. I'm leaving the country tonight. Ziming. Get on the bike! A car explosion rocked the capital city of Kunlang at 1 p.m. yesterday. According to witness reports, the man responsible for the blast is murder suspect, Lu Ziming, a Chinese. His alleged accomplice is Mo Bai, a Kunlang native of Chinese ethnicity. The pair are believed to be traveling together and were last seen in the city around 10 p.m. Authorities are unsure of their whereabouts and urge the public to remain vigilant. Call this number. They'll take care of everything and get you out of here. Why are you leaving me again? I have no family here. My parents died years ago. Now I'm wanted. I don't want to be on the run forever. Come with me, okay? I can't. As a Chinese, I can't let them get away with this. I can't let my friend die for nothing. I'm Chinese too! And as a journalist, I have to make sure the truth gets out. So please don't leave me here. Are you afraid of dying? Are you? Just make sure that the safety is off next time. I can see four soldiers. One of them is on the roof. Hey, Ziming, what's your plan when all of this is over? What kind of girls do you like? Focus on keeping watch, will you? Yes sir. Look out, three o'clock! Behind you! Soldiers approaching, nine o'clock. - Come here. - Come on. What do you want? You know what I want. There is a safe. 1349. Take everything and go. This is over. Fine. I will give you three million more. That's more than you can spend in this life and the next. The money is attractive. But you should know what I really want. Three. Two. One. Dollars! Five million from the Americans. Captain, I think the Chinese company is better suited for this project for its quality, speed, and other aspects. I don't think so. I like Americans more. This money will make you very comfortable in retirement. This idiot wouldn't listen to me. You sold out your own country. You should be punished by your own justice system. But... you killed my brother. Your brother? Leon Miller. Leon? The guards are running inside! Sniper. Blow the explosives! Move! Ziming? Lu Ziming? Are you okay? I'm pinned down by a sniper. I'm stuck. What should I do? The shots are coming from the hill, at your four o'clock. Flank him. Don't let him see you. Okay. Is it you? Yes. What's going on? Did you plan all of this? I did. You... You could have killed me in the car. If I did, you wouldn't try to avenge me. You used me? You taught me a Chinese saying once. "Adapt your plans to those of your opponent." Why are you doing this? Money. A lot of it! Money? We're brothers. We fought together. You are so naïve. Everything has a price. Even brotherhood. It was so much money. How could I say no? You feel sorry because I saved your life and it destroyed mine. But I don't need your pity. You owe me. Now it's time to pay what you owe me. You will die rest in peace knowing that I will enjoy the next half of my life with this money. So... you're just going to kill me? I don't have a choice. Leon. You've changed. I don't even recognize you anymore. Ziming, I found it. There's a van over there. Now. You can shoot him. Ziming, the van is empty. The rifle is shooting on its own! It's remote-controlled. We have to take away its eyes. Shoot the eyepiece. Do you remember what I taught you? Note the distance and wind speed. Hold your breath, then shoot! I missed it! It's all right. Try again. It won't move. Imagine it's target practice. I hit it! Hit the ground! Ziming, what should I do? Move towards your two o'clock. Keep your head down. When I say so, shoot straight up. Now! Lu Ziming! Go! I lost. I'm just glad it was to you. You taught me everything I know. I appreciate that. Now, we're even. Ziming! People like us don't have a choice. The first time I met you, I knew we were the same. You'll end up like me sooner or later. People will do anything for money. So... you know what I want to do! Leon. You don't understand the meaning of brotherhood. We're not the same. This is where our ways part. Excuse me. What's this story about the two Chinese people? It says that Captain Dee was bribed by Imax Oil to kill that Kunlang official. The two were framed for murder. But in the end, Xiahua got the oil concessions! Hey, look! Hi! Goodbye!
