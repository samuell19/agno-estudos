This Subtitle Created By Mehedi Hasan Hello... hello doctor... Please come to the special ICU. One patient is awake. Don't worry. Okay? -What's your name? -Jibin Madhavan. -Where are you from? -Ernakulam. Do you remember where you're now? Isn't it Bangalore? Which year? 2007. 2007! You were in a coma for a week due to meningitis. Only today you regained consciousness. Your field of vision is limited for now. It would be somewhat blurry. You'll soon be well again. -What's your name? -Nayana. My duty is over. See you tomorrow. Where is the other girl, sister? -The one who was here earlier. -English or Kannada? Name? Keerthy. Doctor... Hey! You're up? I want to meet my friends. Sorry, this is a special ICU. Visitors are not allowed here. Once you're shifted to the room, you can meet them. Please, doctor. When will I be shifted? Can you see that photo? It's not clear, doctor. When you're able to see it clearly, we'll shift you. Be here for now. Alright? Take care. Let me know if there is variation in the readings. Okay, doctor. Check the readings and inform the doctor. Okay, see you. Bye. Nayana... Hey! How do you feel now? I met your mother and friends outside. What did the doctor say? What's in that picture? Oh, you've got clarity issues, right? That's Zakir Hussain playing tabla. What happened? Nothing. Take rest. Doctor... Are you up? I can see that photo now. What's in that photo? Isn't it Zakir Hussain playing tabla? Can you shift me to the room now? How's that possible? Doctor, I told him that. I wasn't aware of this task. Cheater! When you are able to see that photo, we'll shift you to the room. No one should tell him what's in that photo. Got it? -That... -I'll show you! Sorry... Nayana... Hey! Micheal Jackson? Micheal Jackson it seems! Nayana... -Yes, what do you want? -Nothing. Arnold in Terminator? Nayana... Yes? Nayana... What? Who else do I have here to talk to? I'm not interested. Hey... Hello... What's it that you've got to tell your friends? You won't understand that. Do you guys live together? Yes. Where in Bangalore? -Bangalore city! Where else? -Oh! Donât want to talk to me anymore? Going to talk? Bangalore... On one side of Bangalore... Seven of us... Mukesh and Nirup were awaiting the appointment letter after clearing an interview. Soman... The business magnet among us. Karikuttan... He works part-time at a petrol pump. Rivin... The only person among us who has got a job, a girlfriend... ...maintains hygiene and is god-fearing. Shijappan... His dream was to become a dancer. Poor guy! And myself... Well, you already know about me, right? ROMANCHAM (GOOSEBUMPS) [sings a popular Malayalam song] [talks gibberish] Hey! Go to your room and sleep, man! Won't even let me take a dump. Is this a pigsty or what? I felt bad when you hung up without giving me a kiss yesterday. -Hey, Nirup is calling you. -Okay. Come fast. He wants to say something. Dear, I'll call you right back. What happened? Listen... We can't go on like this anymore. Don't expect others to do the chores here. Let's divide up the duties. Why? What's there to do here? Those who don't do any work might not be aware. I'll assign the duties. If you wish to eat something, I'm ready to cook. Harikuttan will assist me. Okay. You do the cleaning. You both will do the cleaning. Hold this. Give us something else. Rivin, you'll buy the groceries hereafter. And you'll have to step in for someone if they're not available. Okay, can I go? Got to attend church. Wait. You and Soman should do the dishes. Dishes? Me? -Yes. -I'm ready. Ready? -I'll buy the groceries. -And buy Hans(tobacco) instead? -Hey, I quit Hans. -There's one more thing. Take a month off from drinking. Hey Nirup! Don't try to be my father. Mukesh can't use Hans... Mukesh can't drink... Can I wear my underwear at least? Or is it also banned? It's because you're overdoing it. I've already given you one warning. -If you flout it... -Flout it? I'll beat the hell out of you. Grocer Anoop is getting married. You should all pitch in to buy a gift. Ask him to give us back the money he looted from us first. I don't have any cash on me. You give it if you want. Why do you need to buy a gift? -There are so many items here, right? -What item? That one. Oh My Closet! What are you doing? You want me to spit in the plates? Bro, he's got Hans in his mouth. "This is a palace of crackpots" "You can't get out once you enter" "A tent secured with a deadbolt lock" "The king of indolence, a sage, meditates in the mountain." "A wretch on the warpath" "An epitome of ego, abundant in penury" "Bewitched by inebrity, employed in tomfoolery" "Lives as a spirit sans a future" What! Give me that cigarette. Not ruining your mood. Carry on. Can't you lock the door and do it? Don't forget to wash it. "A cemetery with seven wooden cross" "They take a dig at each other" "There's no solution to fill the stomach" "God is our hope, we're in a soup" "Soaked in sloth from head to toe" "A mesmerizing city, filled with hundreds of millionaires" -They didn't send? -No. Then why did they say we're selected. We performed well. We'll get it for sure. "Even the reflection in mirror displays disdain" Look, she's blushing. "Plenty of time, lack of speed" "The body frozen by indolence" "Wearing everything they got their hands on" "All seven gobbled down the scraps" "Digged in the pockets, no clinking of coins" "A history of unexpected failures" "Stomach gurgles owing to hunger pangs" "The ride is bumpy, hold on to me" "On the land that sells valor as wine" "I don't even have rotten eggs to gamble" "Standing in front of this train called life," "We wave a white flag" "Our city is not so hot" "No free food in this hotel called universe" "There is no pillar to lean on" "Yet we're not in the mood to sweat out" "We lost track of the time" "We lost count of the days" "Grey hairs turned us into an oldie" "No woman cast us a glance" "Ended up as a fly stuck in cobwebs, just a wastrel" "This is a palace of crackpots" "You can't get out once you enter" "A tent secured with a deadbolt lock" "The king of indolence, a sage, meditates in the mountain."

Let's play caroms. Please come. You'll break your leg. It's not because you don't know how to play. Come out, let's play on the ground. That's nice. Hey... Hello... Hello... You've got a call. Rivin! Hey Rivin... Jibi, come play with us till he comes. -I've got other things to do. -Come on, man! I'm hungry. You guys carry on. You must be going to Mathi's. Yes. Hello... -Why are the lights off? -Be quiet. -What's going on here? -It's ouija board. -The spirit board? -Exactly! Good spirit, please come. It's DJ's idea. He used to play it at home. Saw that glass? If it moves, it means the spirit is present. Really? Will it come anytime soon? It hasn't come yet. But there is a chance. Good spirit...Uff! Oh no! Spirit won't appear if we mention God. -Is it? -Yes. -Why hasn't it appeared yet? -Come, let's eat. -It's not my cousin to come as soon as we call. -Come on, boys. Go and have kanji. Don't sit here. Hey, please turn on the motor. What are you cooking today? Anything that can be made using four okra and three ivy gourds. Close it, man! There are rats. Pickle, flex, closet.. Every business was a flop. Aren't you tired of it? I learned many things from it. I'm considering starting a business associated with my studies. -What did you study? -Plus two, Biology. -What are you going to do with it? -Biological business. What? Barn owl, star tortoise, sand boa... -For what? -Donât you know? Come on, I'll explain. These are worth a lot in international markets. Keeping star tortoises at home brings fortune. You get it from the pond? That's the ordinary tortoise. This is 'star tortoise'. Who would catch it? There are people for it. We buy it from them and resell it. Can't they sell it themselves? Will you bite off his lips? Can't you go sit somewhere else with your lips? It would affect my business. -My image... -Leave it. Tell me about the star tortoise. Where's the rat poison? Will have to buy from Shivaji Nagar. Is it that bad? Yes. Why is this cough syrup so expensive? I'm struggling to meet the monthly expenses. We'll need to chip in additional cash. Hey! -Is that Hans? -No. He's lying. Go check. Mukesh... Mukesh... -What happened? -Where's the Hans? Hans? I went to flush the closet. Don't act smart, Mukesh. It'll be there in his bag. If you touch my bag, I'll chop off your hands. -Will you? -Yes. Come on, go ahead. Take his bag. What was that? What did you throw away? What happened? Keep an eye on my slippers. We're being hurled with insults today. What's going on here? What's that? Found it? Open... open... You want? When did you buy it? One month ago. Tell me, where did you hide it? Well, itâs not there in my bag. Then whose bag? -My bag?! -Yes. -I'm going to tell them. -Go ahead. Guys! Shall I tell them? And I'll tell them about the weed in your bag. It's just to sniff for fun. My Hans is also for that. Let it be there. Please take it back after some time. I'll think about it. What's that? Since you repeatedly asked us, we decided to play another game instead of volleyball. Thank God! Which game? -Hit Ball. -Hit ball? Hey, that would hurt. Not at all! Hey! Wait there. Get lost, you shorty! It doesn't look good when you wrap it in cloth. Otherwise, it'd bounce and go down. Will you go and fetch it? No, I won't. Go on, wrap it. Hi Jibi... It was unfair. Yes. -Extremely unfair! -Of course. Burst this new ball as well. Where are you off to? This moron left the tap open and the room got flooded. We had to swim to get inside. My dear Babu, have you ever been of any help to us? Dude, I need help from you. -From me? -Yes. 2 kg banana. -Is it to eat today or tomorrow? -We'll eat it when we want. It's to know whether you want it ripe or raw. -Give me the ripened ones. -Alright. Why these many items? Nirup had asked for it. Is it? Take it. Looks like he boozed from somewhere. No, he was at home the whole time. -And he's broke. -Should we take him to the hospital? Let's see. Why did you buy rotten bananas? I asked for ripened ones. Pappad, bannana... Soda- 10, Frooti- 1, plastic cup... Who bought these items? It was not me. He tripped over those things and broke them. -Mukesh? -Yes. Go drink your cough syrup, man! We've already exceeded our budget. I won't pay for these items. Let him pay. Nirup bro! Nirup bro! -Nirup bro! -Coming. -What happened? -It's empty. Let him come round. We can give him a hiding. If you don't get booze, you gulp down medicine? Let go of my legs. I can't breathe. Hey! Get off me. Good morning. I got a call from Bombay. They are ready to pay up to 3 million. We can seal the deal if they pay 5 million. Yeah, it's for the barn owl. We'll hit the jackpot with this one deal. Lilliput is not in now. It's a good time for barn owls. No need for frogs. You can have it for dinner. It has no buyers. -Hey, weren't you there to beat me up? -Beat you up? What's he saying? But if you go on like this, you'll soon receive a thrashing. What are you doing? This? It's a first-class item. I'll show you. There was no need to buy crackers with borrowed money. Dude, happiness matters the most in life. Let's surprise them. Yes. Despite being Diwali, there were no sales. Else we could have bought more. This is called ouija board. Keep the coin first. Then on top of it... Stop the commentary. Just do it. It's a serious matter. Don't distract me. Okay? Got it? Once we light the candle... ...keep a glass over it. After that, keep your index finger on it. Okay? Keep your fingers, man! Repeat after me. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Say it sincerely. Just like you pray. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. When the spirit is here... this glass will start to move. Which means... The ghost has come. Don't be scared. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Spirit, are you there? Please move this glass if you're here. Come out if you're done. Let's go play volleyball after bursting the crackers. Come on, guys. Hey, don't go. It will come now. Give us a call when the spirit comes. Hey, don't remove your finger... spirit.. Spirit's finger... damn! Hey! How will the spirit move it if I can't do it myself? Listen Anoop... We will not pay for the items we didn't buy. How's that possible, Nirodh? How can you refuse to pay for the damaged items? -I damaged them? -No. Go ask the person who damaged it. Give me two bulbs. My dear Nirodh... It's Nirup! Don't you get paid on time every time? So don't fabricate the bills. You smoke beedi? Occasionally. Want it? Who's that? Excuse me, can I have a little prasad? It's to get rid of the beedi taste. -I love you too. -Too? She'll make it an issue. She likes me. That's why she gave me the prasad. Come. -Come, let's play. -Ruined the carrom board? Why do you always eat before playing? -Have it after the game. -It's for stamina. -Where's the air pump? -Over there. Come on, man. Please come. -Where are you going? -Toilet. You could have poured the kanji directly into the closet. Why simply drink it if you want to go potty right away? Listen... It's because of these photos of God that the spirit didn't come last time. What's it? If we remove these photos it'll definitly come. Jibi, go have some kanji and sleep. Come, let's go. -Hey, come. -Come out if you want to play. Mukesh, come fast. Just for half an hour. -Come, man -To play? Not interested. Hey idiot, come out. Come out! -Come out! -Is it for money? -Come out! -Pappa... Tell me who it was. It's been many times. You thought you could mess with us? Pappa, let's go. You are bothering her all the time. How dare you propose to her? Propose? That's enough. -Who was it? -What happened? It's itching. -What happened? -Rivin came. Thank God. They have been bothering her for a while now. They even proposed to her. -These people? -Yes. -They are bothering your daughter? -Yes, they proposed to her. -Proposed to her? -Yes. Brother, look at their faces. Do they look like decent people? I don't want to hear all this. Knock some sense into their heads. Yeah brother, these people are totally jobless. They just sit at home and bother the girls. Brother, I'm the only person who has got a job. They are not aware of my power. Hey! Why are you giving a dirty look? -This is the last warning. -Heard it? If you bother my daughter once more, I'll kill you. -Got it? -Okay, Iâll handle them. -Please go. -Come on. Listen... Though I don't know how to speak Hindi, I can understand it. You swore at us more than he did. You expect me to support your antics towards that girl? Yes, of course. -What antics? -Come and play. Come, let's play. -Isn't this ouija board? -Yes! Wow, you know it? -Come, let's play. -Yes, I know. -Come on. -I'll show you! -Nirup! -I called him many times. -Nirup! -Nirup! Come on! -What the heck is this? -What? This is against Jesus. I won't allow this here. Is that so? This house doesn't belong to you alone. We all pay the rent equally. Since you've got a single room, you're supposed to pay more. Then why don't you take that room and pay more rent? If you've got a problem with it, sleep with me. Who would sleep with him? Will you? I won't. How can we sleep with him? He's always on the phone flirting. Yes. So that's the problem! There is no one for you to flirt with! Aren't you ashamed? This is my house too. I'll do what I want. This is our house too. We'll also do whatever we want. Come on, guys. Let's play. We'll also do as we wish. Come, sit. Nirup, this won't do. Let's do one thing. The spirit will come if there are no signs of God, right? Yes. Keep the idols in his room. Let him sit inside and play. We won't let you enjoy alone. My God as well. Guys, please enjoy your time here. Take care of them. Switch off the light. When I keep the glass... Super! It'll definitely come today. Once I place the glass, keep your fingers. Okay? Keep your fingers. Come on. Good spirit, please come. Say it properly. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Spirit, are you there? It has come. What's your name? A Bring a book and pen. Else shall we... Hey, what did it say? What's it? ANAMIKA Anamika... It says yes. Next question? She's waiting for the question. Let's send her back now. We can plan and continue tomorrow. Alright. Repeat after me. Good spirit, please leave. Say Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Have you left? Spirit, have you left? Looks like she left. Holy cow! This game is quite popular. But spirit rarely shows up. Let's not play it again. I'm afraid. Hey, did you see who came? Who? Anamika. If you're scared, go to Rivin's room. It's not just me. He's also scared. K A ANAMIKA It's Anamika. Dude, Anamika has come. What is 2+2? Four! -How many colors are there in Rainbee? -Rainbee? Rainbow! Seven! It's correct. What's Karikuttan's real name? H A R I HARI Harikutta! What's the name of my future wife? Why is it rotating? Sometimes... ...it rotates if the spirit is not interested to answer. It's like that. See. That's what. At least the first letter. Please... Please... G Gouri! -The one who brings milk? -Yes. She likes me. She had sent me a message last week asking for the payment. Then what's my girlfriend's name? -Mine too. -I also wanna know. -Mine first. -Stop it! What's this? This is enough for today. -Come on, let's go have a smoke. -Yes. -Good spirit, please leave. -No need. You guys go. I'll take your place. No, it's alright. -We'll go later. -I want to give it a try. -It's alright. -Don't remove my finger. I've kept mine. Take your time. Mukesh, you come. It's alright. Shijappan will do it. No, I wanna know my girl's name. Shijappan will ask for you. Sit there. What was your question? First letter of my future wife's name. D D! What happened? We're taking a cigarette break. Trust me, I saw it. Jibi asks, and the glass answers. Jibi asks, and the glass answers. If I had been by myself, you would have accused me of lying. He was also there. Ask him. Even though Babu screamed his lungs out here, our glass never moved. Even blowing air at it didn't help. Idiot! I've seen it a lot. I'm the one who taught him. This is some sort of a gimmick. Spirit doesn't show up so easily. This is jealousy. Don't listen to him. Listen, don't eat these coconut chunks. It's got rat poison. -The ones in the kitchen, right? -The ones here. Can't you keep a rat trap? I tried it many times. It was of no use. -Where did you go? -Out. Don't go anywhere in the evening. We've got to play. -At night, right? -Yes. Okay. Wow! Don't eat it! It's rat poison. -Are you going to kill us? -I had told him. Who? What's written here? Don't eat the coconut chunks. It contains rat poison. Hi, this is my friend Aadi. Come in. Guys, this is my friend Aadi. -Go ahead, play. -Sit down. Then ask her about my marriage. You won't get married at all. I'll get married after 5 years at least. I want to ask her one thing. Will I succeed in life? No need to ask that to her. I'll give you the answer. You'll never ever succeed. Brother... These are all silly questions. Even I can answer them. Why don't you ask a question then? Okay. I've got a pussy. -Pussy? -He means cat. Can you say its name? Well... If she's not in a good mood, she might not answer. The glass would rotate instead. MARS What happened? Hey! -No one knows its name. -It's correct. It died 4 years back. Six. Bro... It's correct. Not 4 years. It's been 6 years. Where have you brought me? Stay, man. Let's talk. Talk? To the ghost? Do it yourself. Hey, don't go. That's enough for today. Let's go and sleep. Send the ghost back. Good spirit, please leave. ANAMIKA Let's send Anamika back. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. Good spirit, please leave. -Bro! All good? -Yes. -Who's that? -My friends. -Go on, ask. - Ask what? My gold chain of 2 sovereigns went missing. Isn't it 1.5 sovereigns? My chain of 1.5 sovereigns is missing. Can you tell us who took it? Good question. It moved. Is it 'S'? U L Sulochana! Yes, Sulochana! I'd told you then itself she was the one who took it. -And what did you say then? -Please calm down. What did you say? Your darling sister! You... -Move aside, boy! -Hey, donât go. Calm down, dear. -Hey, I got it. -Is it? Yes. It's dead. Hey! Why did you put the cross? To prevent it from coming back. Good. Booze? Come on. Please move. Give us a way. He's my friend. Move. Son... We got the chain back. It was under Sulochana's bed. Convey our regards to Anamika. Yes, please do. It's so spicy. Next time, bring juice. -It's jam-packed. -Check out the game inside. -Come on, let's play. -No, let's go out. -You go play with professionals. -Let's try one round. No need. Go home. My son went missing 10 years ago. My son went missing 10 years ago. I don't know where he's now. I don't know where he's now. I paid him 5000 rupees. I can pay you 10,000 rupees. -Did you take money from him? -Yes. Ask him to leave now itself. I want to know where my son is. Tell me if he's alive at least. But we didn't ask anything. Someone quaffed my booze without asking me. I want to know who it is. I think it's him. I didn't take it. Let the ghost say that. Yes! You ass! The game is fun if there is an expert with us. I can't let you inside like this. Stand in a queue. First come first served. Three people can come. Come inside. What happened? An auto rickshaw collided with a cow and overturned. So? I was inside that auto rickshaw. It is a sign of good fortune. -Rivin, come and eat. -What the heck is this? Come on, it's free for us. Where are you going? Don't you see the queue? Hey! It's my house. I pay the highest rent here. Move aside. Take your hands off me. Stop it! Get out! Leave right away. Outsiders need not come to play anymore. Dammit! Scram! Enough. No more games. Clear off! It's good that it didn't happen while playing. Thank God! This will at least end your game. No way! We're not stopping. Let's buy a new board. How's it? It's a new board. Hope Anamika comes. A. It's Anamika. Anamika! The spirit is still the same. Yes. Whoâs that? I will check. There are many rules you're unaware of. -I'll teach you everything. -No, thanks. If the same ghost keeps coming back, it'll become very powerful. It would influence us. Is it? Go ahead. Don't ask them any personal questions. They won't like it. Especially about their deaths. Don't withdraw your fingers during the game simultaneously. If you do so, the ghost will never leave this house. You leave first. You'd scare away the ghost. What? Goosebumps... We experience a chill when the ghost is nearby. Our hairs become erect. See this. -All good, Jibi? -Yes. -Is this the house? -Yes. What's my 10th grade score? 218. It's correct. Boys! What a pity! Will it answer... my question? Yes. What's my vehicle number? -Should I ask in Kannada? -No. What's my vehicle number? 4316. 4316? Is that my bike's number? Is it? Oh! That's my car's number. Yes! That's what! Anamika won't go wrong. Wait. But you already know that. Let's ask about something you don't know. What's my father's name? R A RASHID Rashid? My father's name? Rashid? My father's name is Kunju Mohammad. Got it? No, brother. It's Rashid. Rashid is my uncle. My father's name is Kunju Mohammad. No, it's not. How can I go wrong with my father's name? What the heck is this? -Playing with fathers' names? -It's just a game. So what? My father's name is not Rashid. It's Kunju Mohammad! What the heck is this game? Do you know who I am? You know my reputation? Don't you always come to me when you're in trouble? And you're making a fool of me now! Your bloody board! Is this why you came to this city? Look Jibi... Forget it. It's just a game. What game? Is this how you play? How many times have you come to me with your problems? Jibi, I'm serious. I'll chop off your legs. I'm... Vadakeveetil Kunju Mohammad's son. Understood? R... R... Ra... Kunju Moha... Rashid! His uncle... What's there to laugh at? Stop it. Anamika is interesting. Anamika, where are you from? Who all are there at home? Won't say? -At least tell us how you died. -Stop it! That's enough. Don't ask such questions. Let's continue tomorrow. Come, keep your finger. I'm going home. Hey, that's enough. Bye. We aren't supposed to ask such questions. But we didn't ask anything. Write it down. Someone will die? Show it. Mathew will die tonight. Mathew? Who's Mathew? Dude, it's Mathi! -Don't go alone. -Don't remove your finger. That's Mathi's bike. Where did he go? Mathi... Hey! I was taking my mobile. A dog jumped in front of my bike. -Let's go home. -But my house is over there. -Stay with us tonight. -No, it's alright. No, stay with us. -Are you okay? -Yes. -My bike? -We can take it tomorrow. Your key. They are coming. Why are you guys standing here? -What happened? -A small accident. Accident? What happened to you guys? After you left... ...it said you would die. -Who? -Glass. -Glass? -Anamika, man! And you brought me here so she could devour me? I would have gone home. If you go home, we cannot be at peace. -Stay here tonight. -So that you can see her murder me? But nothing happened, right? What happened? Bring water. Hurry up. Hey... Come fast, man. Drink water. You'll be fine. Drink this water. Jesus! Drink. I'm going home. Take him home. I'll go. Hurry up. Hey! Hey! Why are you late? Your goddamn game has made my life miserable. -What? -I couldn't find my way home. What exactly happened? I was coming by my usual route and... the street lights went off suddenly, and I wasn't able to see anything.... I don't know what's happening... How is it possible to get lost on a familiar route? You're getting scared for no reason. Get some sleep. Pray before bed. It's his trick to stop the game. Not happening! What about Mathi's incident? But he didn't die, right? The night is not yet over. 'Anamika' was made up by us, right? Hey! -'Anamika' was made up by us, right? -Yes. Then why should we get scared? Why did you take so long? Where were you? -DJ Babu scared the life out of me. -What? He said we're not playing properly and a strange death would occur. Strange death? Catch this. We only made up... Right? How long should you wear the plaster cast? A couple of weeks more. Yesterday night... Anoop's father passed away. He's been bedridden for a while. -Should we go see him? -Yes. I'm not coming. Why? His name is Mathew. Come on, man! Don't say this is the Mathew Anamika mentioned. Are you crazy? He had been ill for quite some time. What's this? Are you not sleeping? It's almost morning. She was not leaving. We've been asking her to leave since ten o'clock. Our throats started to dry out. She just left. Jibi, take a look at this book. It's like reading a detective novel. COME TO MY WORLD... SUICIDE... I WILL KILL YOU I think we're not playing properly. Let's bring someone who knows the game. I've asked DJ Babu. Let him give it a try. Just what we needed! Since I've got the amulet, I'm safe. I got lost despite carrying a rosary. You think amulets help? Are you saying the rosary has more power than an amulet? Not like that. No matter what we wear, we'll be doomed. I'm going. -Where are you going? -Call me when you're done. Going to get lost? Don't bring someone who wasn't welcomed here all this time. If he goes overboard, I'll hit him. Calm down, Jibi. Let's see. Let him come first. What's this foul smell? It's dead rat. No, it's the sign of evil spirits. I guess you still despise me. -Aren't you coming? -Get lost. Play it yourself. Which side is east? That side. Get up. Move from there. I need two people. Hey! Aren't you sick? Go. You sit. You seem fine. First, we should light this candle. Then close it with this glass. Babu...we have been playing for a while now. That's why I had to come here now. Keep your finger. -Other hand. -What? The other hand. Sorry. Repeat after me. Good spirit, please come. What? Say good spirit, please come. It comes only if we say it in Malayalam. Don't teach me how it's done. Just do what I say. Say it. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit, please come. Good spirit... Are you there? What's your name? ANAMIKA Anamika. -Anamika? -Yes. Anamika What is 4+3? 7. Seven! Seven. Anamika... When they send you back every time... ...do you really leave this house? No! How long have you been staying here? 27 days. Do they enrage you? Yes! Anamika... do you... ...feel like killing them? Stop it! Yes! Yes. -You! -Oh my God! Jibi! Don't hit him, man. Hey, stop it. No violence. Get out of here! -Come, keep your finger. -No. Take your hands off me. You guys were playing by yourselves, right? Not even once did you ask me to join. You'll all be doomed. You guys will never make it in life. Hey, it's moving. Jibi! It's moving. I hope you guys perish! Oh God! Get lost! What's your problem? You go and play if you want. Next year, at the same time, I'll celebrate your death anniversary. It'll be your death anniversary. -Mathi, take him home. -Babu... I'm also coming. Nirup bro, please come inside. I've been calling you guys. Hey, please come inside. She's saying something. I wrote down half of it. What the heck is this? How will I know? I was writing with my left hand. I called you guys many times. Hey! Move. No one should utter 'Anamika' or 'Ouija board' in this house anymore. If you talk about it, I'll beat you to a pulp. Auntie, I've brought lunch. -Did you boys eat? -Yes. Soma, how's your leg? It's better now. My original name is Nithin Narayanan. Soman is my nickname. But Soman suits you more. -You must be going to circulate this. -Of course. Since you're narrating the story so well, I'll not have to tell you what the photo is. You can go home directly. Tell me the rest. Didn't you play after that? No. It was boring. Damn boring! "A loss, a craze" "Hard to let go" "Onerous to give up this habit" "Time to bring it to a close" "Parting is heart-wrenching" "This sorcery found way into our hearts at the wrong time" "Summoning you was a mistake" "Life is chaotic since you arrived" "Our light dried up, our valour too" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "What's the remedy, we wonder" "Put a stop to numbing with fear" "Like you startle when someone surprises you out of bloom" "The nightmare which disturbs your sleep" "We lost our time, our happiness too" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" Look... Look at him. Come fast. I've got him. -He's dead drunk. -I stopped, man! You don't have to stop. You'll be finished today. Stop it. Let him do whatever he wants. I'm not his father to give him advice, right? Leave it. Don't be upset. Upset? For what? You didn't remove it from my bag? Why don't you understand? Bro... freedom is more important than agony. Otherwise, the British would still be holding us upÂ as slaves. Their fight was not for drugs. -It's so peaceful now. -Yes. There's positivity. Is there a smell? No. -Nirup... -What happened? You know my friend Sinu, right? -Who? -The one from my hometown. Yes, you've told me. He was abducted for ransom by some locals here. Do you need money? No, they brought him back for free. I just got a call from his friend. He said Sinu has been acting strangely. I spoke to Sinu. He sounded fine to me. But his friends asked if he could stay with us until he became normal. Good idea! We ourselves are trying to maintain our normal selves here. What's this, man? Your friend is our friend too. Bring him. Nirup, the ghost he brought last time is still here... And you wanna bring another person? Why is he like this? Hey! What did you say? If you say this once again, we'll beat you up. Come on, guys. Bring him. Let others say whatever they want. I won't send him back even if it means I have to behead myself. Have breakfast. No, thanks. My suppliers are bringing the sand boa tomorrow. It'll be here for a few days. You wanna bring snakes home? You don't have any issues with ghosts or lunatics. But my sand boa is a problem. Go get him. -No violence! No violence! -Leave it. Krishna, I never thought we would get a chance to meet in person. Jesus, get off that cross and come down. We need to talk. -What? -How do you turn water into wine? No, that's my trade secret. Krishna, why is there a sound when you talk? It's because of this flute. What's going on here? I was just imagining their conversation. Rivin, right? -I'm Sinu Solomon. -I know. -Nice room. -It's mine. I'll just... Mother, did you have dinner? Of course I had. Goodnight. Take good care of yourself. Is it morning? I brush my teeth before going to bed. Don't you? Sometimes. What were you doing inside? It has been a while. Simply... Is it Hans? No. Don't you workout? I'm naturally fit. I don't need it. Jibi and I were regulars. -What? -Workout. Take out that yellow wire. -And? -Connect it to the other side. Oh, come on! Bun and mixture? Kanji is being prepared. Have this for now. Why is he always smiling? He's always been like that. But how can someone smile all the time? Stop it. He'll hear. Hey! Sinu... Don't play... stop it! Jibi... it hurts. It's not right to throw remotes at people. Hey, it turned on. It was not working. It was like pausing a video. He turned into a statue. When I saw him for the first time, he was dubbing for Krishna and Jesus. Is it? Come on, let's eat. This early? It's Sinu's treat. Biriyani. Sinu... Sinu... Jibi! You threw food at me? Do you know how many people are starving out there? You're behaving like a spoiled brat. Have it. Hey, what's the use of losing your cool at him? Simply... Then what do you expect me to do? You guys already blame me for the issues around here. You're simply blowing it out of proportion. Blow it out of proportion! You were here? Jibi... didn't you like the biriyani? No, it was good. Do you want anything else? No. Come, let's sleep. Come on. What happened? Not able to sleep? I'm thinking of going home for a few days. I was about to... No need. You just arrived, right? Stay here for a while. Oh no! Jibi! -What happened? -Don't know. Jibi... What happened? Had a nightmare? What's going on here? Wonât you let me sleep? Dear, I was talking here. Can someone turn off the light? -Hello... -Yes? What are you doing? Drinking hot water for throat pain. Why don't you try skull soup? -What? -Human skull. Skull soup is good for it. Nirup bro! Jibi! Where's everyone? I'm here, right? Why are you calling them? Nirup bro. Jibi! What's next? Sinu Solomon asked me whether I wanted skull soup. Jibi, you talk to him. I think he's not out of shock yet. A heart-to-heart talk might do him good. Go and talk. -He must have slept. I'll talk tomorrow... -No! He scared the hell out of me just now. Go and talk. Come... Come with me. I'll talk to him. Come on. -Why are you getting scared for all this? -Then what? Getting frightened for no reason. Don't worry. I'll talk to him. I've seen you walking here and there at night without sleeping. No wonder your face looks dull. Adults need at least 8 hours of sleep. Your face will appear dull if you don't get enough sleep. Leave that. How long have you been living here? It was a nice photo. Simply burnt it. Poor girl! It'll get worse if I talk to him. Then who else will talk? We have no connection with him. Business means what sort of business? Sand boa, star tortoise, barn owl etc... Sand boa was supposed to come. That's when you arrived. It's not a problem for me. Don't move. There's another idea. A mutual friend of ours lives nearby. Let's call him. Should we involve an outsider? Oh God! What the heck is this? Rat. Did you want to keep it? Keep it? Is this how you kill a rat? I'll clean it up. I'll do it. Didn't you mention a mutual friend earlier? Call him. Call him. What are you growing there? Tapioca? No, it's cross. Cross-cultivation on other people's land! Who would cultivate it in their own land? Who's this jerk? -Nithin Naray... -Soman! I've been very busy. There's work at two sites. That's why I hesitated to come. Tell me. What's your problem? Benny bro, there is a problem. I'm not able to handle it alone. You might be able to help sometimes. From our village... -Benny bro! -Yeah? Sinu! -You were here? -It's been 2 days. Is it? He didn't tell me anything. Sit down. -How are you? -Superb! -How's your mom? -She's good. Tell me about your problem. It's nothing. Have tea. Nothing? Have this tea. Have it. How's your mom? Did you go home? No, I didn't go. No health issues? Take your phone. Dial this number. -I didn't know you were here. -It's been 2 days only. -I was staying nearby. -Great! My phone is ringing. I'll come now. Poor boy. Bro, there are many problems here. Since the last two days... Benny bro... Sinu! Since the last two days? -What? -Tell me your problem. There's no problem. Are you making a fool of me? You called me saying you needed to discuss an urgent matter. He called me saying there was some important matter. I'll come now. You guys carry on. What the heck! I was in the middle of work. Bro, you shouldn't have yelled at him. Why? He's been acting strange for the past two days. What are you saying? He throws the remote at me without any reason... Throws food while eating... There was a nice poster in the room. He tore it off. Screaming in fright at night... You know what? He scolded me for killing a rat. -Really? -Yes. This is complicated. Shall we inform his parents? No need. His mother will get upset. I'll look after him. -Are you sure? -Yes. Call me if there's anything. -You've got my number, right? -Yes. Give me a call. I'll come later. Sinu, please look after him. I'll come later. Hey! Don't worry. There won't be any problems. He'll be on our watch from hereon. We can sleep on either side of him at night. Got it? Go eat. I'll eat later. Have it. "Took out the venomous serpent from its hole, wore it around my neck" "We are in hot water, going bonkers" "My power and brains are chopped into bits" "Went whacky, crippled myself" "We're done being the prey" "Plead with you earnestly" "When will we be freed from your clasp?" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" He must be going to pee. There's a railway track nearby. Let's see what he's up to. You guys came? Come on, I'll introduce you both. See, that is where Muniyappa was found dead. His head came rolling down. Over there. You see that branch? David's body was hanging from there. His tongue was this long. Over there... Do you see that house? That is Anamika's house. The house where our Anamika died. -Oh My God! -Where are you going? Oh no! Oh God! Jibi! Hey Jibi! Yay! We overtook the train. I'm done! We can continue tomorrow. -What do we do? -You idiot! That psycho should be gone from here by tomorrow morning. Just get rid of him. Got it? His bloody skull soup! -Say something. -Long live Mother India! Enough? I'm still in shock. Initially, I wasn't frightened. But I lost it when he said Anamika's name. How does he know Anamika? That's what I'm also asking. How does he know her? I haven't said anything. Anyway, Jibi has informed his parents. He'll go home tomorrow. -Sure? -Of course. Else, I'll chase him out. You said even if you had to behead yourself, you wouldn't send him away. You thought I meant it? Mom, what rubbish are you saying? I'm so happy here. Why are you simply getting tense? And Jibi won't let me leave even if I want to. He only asked me to come. Mom, don't lie. He needs me now. Go. See him off. Jibi, you heard what she said? She's come to take me home. She came by car. Tell her you won't let me leave. Listen, go home with your mother. "Uttering broken words..." "Casting a silent gaze..." "He disappears all alone..." "Ending the time spent together" "This summer season of memories" "As it comes to a bitter end" "I stand here, all alone" "As you wander around, staying away from everyone" "Like a silent observer, I watch everything" "As the entire world blames you" "Like a silent observer, I watch everything" Just yesterday I fixed the puncture. But it got punctured again. Can't you buy a tube instead of fixing the puncture? The tube and tyre are brand new. Punctured again? I'd told you to call a Priest and bless this house. But you didn't listen to me. I got lost on my way home again. You didn't clear the interview, right? -I'll get selected. -Yeah, wait for it! -Got another one? -Yes. It has started again. -What happened? -No work today? I lost my job. -What? -I got fired. What happened? I put diesel instead of petrol and they fired me. -You should have been careful. -Not me... I had checked. Something strange is going on. What happened? Cooker exploded. I was in the bathroom. Don't you see a face there? Get lost! Look at his leg. This is how it began. Let's go through this together. What the heck is this? It's Anamika. Something is wrong here. I think it's better to bless the house like Rivin said. Where are you off to early in the morning? I'm not going anywhere. Now only I got back home. I got lost again, ran out of petrol and had to push the bike all the way home. Really? You'll be doomed! Mother, do you people ever listen to me? You have no regard for me. Do you? Do you ever take my opinion on anything? -Bro, we ran out of gas. -What? Gas. -Go down. -Money? I'll deal with it. Please don't tell Dad this. Before things get worse, let's bring a priest and bless the house. Please listen to me. He's not the only one living in this house. Please convince him somehow. I'll talk to him tonight. I spoke to everyone. I think it's better to bring a priest and bless the house like Rivin said. Aren't you ashamed to say this? Why are you encouraging his stupid ideas? There is nothing to be ashamed of. What's the problem with it? There are many problems. Our beliefs will be questioned. What's the problem with blessing the house? If you don't want a Christian priest, we can bring a Hindu priest. Don't talk nonsense. -Religion is not the issue here. -Then what? Bringing a priest means admitting that there is a ghost here. Jibi, don't you think so? Are you saying there is a ghost here? Then what was going on here all this time? We were simply imagining it. Was there any problem when Sinu was here? Anamika was completely forgotten. Oh really? What about his strange behavior? It's Sinu who scares me more than Anamika. I'm gonna tell Rivin to bring the priest tomorrow. Hey! Hey! Can someone turn on the motor? It was Shijappan and I who moved the glass. Me? -Hey! -Did I move it? I don't remember... No! I did it alone. I moved it with my finger. I made the whole thing up, all of it. I'll show you, come on! Come on, man! Turn off the light. Who's this? Close the door! Look how many ghosts are going to come. How many do you want? You didn't keep your finger, right? I'll show you now. See how many are gonna come. How many do you want? How many? Shall I bring someone other than Anamika? I'll show you how I bring another ghost. Wait and watch. [talks gibberish] Oh God! Rivin! "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" "Hey spirit, please leave" That fever brought me to this hospital. "Hey spirit, please leave" Alright. But what's it that you've got to tell your friends now? Just before I passed out... I saw something. Anamika hasn't gone anywhere. She's still there in that house. Inside my yellow bag. I want to inform them of this. Kaliya Mardan. What? That photo. It's Lord Krishna's Kaliya Mardan. This will do. Is this fine? What... about my bag? Don't worry about that. We're going home now. We'll ask that priest to come. Are you all going home? Let them go. Sinu will stay here. -Sinu? -Yes, he only brought me here. He was here all these days. He went home to collect your clothes. "Hey rodents, come this way to enjoy yourselves" "Let's live together hereafter" "Come, let's offer prayers jointly" "There's no way out of this now" "Come knock on my door with your things" "Let's play earsplitting music at night" "If you come across an eerie shadow on the wall" "Avoid running away or shrieking" "Make an error, pay a price for it" "Go off your rocker" "Shake with fear, spit the lather" "Bath the house in blood" "Let me pay my homage to you" "Let me pay my homage to you" Nirup! Sit straight. Mukesh, sit closer. Soma... Ready? Okay, smile.
