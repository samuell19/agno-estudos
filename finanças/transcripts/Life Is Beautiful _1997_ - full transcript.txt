There must be other waiters, right? Bowing! Piece of cake You bow down farther Like this. At a 45 degree angle, just like a champagne bottle 45 degrees, even 50, 55... 90 degrees, a right angle. 180... How far do I bow down, 180 degrees? Like this? Think of sunflowers, they bow to the sun But if you see some that are too bowed down... it means they're dead! You're serving, you're not a servant Serving is a supreme art God is the first servant God serves men, but he's not a servant to men! - There was no button here - It doesn't go there, silly!

And I fell asleep Amazing. And it's simple too I want to try too I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping... Don't move your hands, you're not a juggler! It's a matter of thought, it's serious, and plus it takes time We'll talk about it tomorrow Amazing, though Wake up Wake up What is it now? What are you doing? - It totally works! - What works? Schopenhauer! You know what I just said? "Wake up!" Bam! You woke up This theory is incredible - How does this all happen? - You were yelling in my ear!

This is the princess who fell from the sky into my arms Is he the one who sucked the stinger out of your thigh? Yes. We keep meeting like this. You just suddenly show up We could make plans to meet - Tonight at 8:00? - No, it's nicer this way Let's go Dora, you'll be late I hope we meet again suddenly Farewell, princess! Did you see her? She's pretty, huh? She likes it when I suddenly appear I don't believe it "Darkness" You're a genius! "The more there is, the less you see" Solution: Darkness Marvelous Did you make that up? No, but you solved it in five minutes, it took me eight days Darkness! Salmon, salad and a glass of white wine Listen to this one, Guido If I may, it's my turn My dad told me this when I was a kid Show White and the seven dwarves sit down for a bite How fast can you guess what she serves her guests next? It sounds refined I want to solve it right now Eat first or it'll get cold I don't want to, it's too late Salad, salmon, white wine, it's light Snow White... and the seven dwarves... - Is the kitchen closed? - Everybody's gone. Why? A gentleman from Rome is here, from the Ministry. He wants to eat The kitchen is closed Oh well, he would have given you a good tip The kitchen is open Come right in Doctor, you're not eating anything? Snow White and the seven dwarves... I know the kitchen is closed, maybe a cold dish... It's all delicious, take your pick Something light Well, we've got meat, a nice heavy steak... lamb, kidneys, some greasy breaded liver Otherwise, there's fish We have... a nice fatty turbot... eel stuffed with fatty sausage and greased with Grand Marnier... or some lean salmon The salmon, thank you Side dish? There's a side dish too? Feel free to choose. We have very, very, very fried mushrooms... buttered potatoes in Nancy butter with a flaky sauce Is there a small, light salad? If not, nothing A light salad? What a pity, the very, very, very fried mushrooms... were out of this world. So, a light salad... a lean salmon and a glass of white wine Perfect. As soon as possible I'll do my best "How fast can you guess what she served her guests next?" Right? - Snow White and the seven dwarves! - Good night, Doctor! Good night, genius! What did he say? Snow white? What is he, drunk? It's a riddle. "Seven seconds" "Seven seconds" is the solution time "Snow White and the seven dwarves" If there are seven dwarves dining... and she serves seconds, that means "seven seconds" Doctor Lessing is a physician, a very serious person But he's obsessed with riddles, he loses sleep over them! Excuse me, the Francesco Petrarca School... The elementary school? A friend of mine teaches there. It's beautiful It's not far from here. Why? Good, I can sleep an extra half-hour Do you have to go to that school tomorrow morning? They're expecting me at 8:30 Please, children, silence! A moment of attention The Inspector from Rome will be here shortly I want to make a good impression on him Listen very quietly and carefully to what he says He'll tell us some very important things about our beautiful country The inspector is here, ma'am He's already here?

Our race is superior I've just come from Rome, right this minute... to come and tell you in order that you'll know, children... that our race is a superior one I was... chosen, I was, by racist Italian scientists... in order to demonstrate... how superior our race is Why did they pick me, children? Must I tell you? Where can you find... someone more handsome than me? Justly so, there is silence. I'm an original "superior race"... pure Aryan Children... let's start with something that one says, "What so big about that?" The ear. Look at the perfection of this ear Left auricle... with a pendant little bell at the end Check it out! Movable cartilage! Bendable! Find two ears more beautiful than these and I'll leave!

Gentlemen! I must say goodbye now... because I have to go, I have an appointment I'll make my Aryan exit and bid you farewell Farewell! The belly button! I'll see you in Venice, princess! I can only hear out of this ear Look at me, princess Go on, I'm down here Look at me, princess Turn around, princess Turn around, around... - Can we get a chocolate ice cream? - Yes, but we'll have to be quick Why?

Let's just go to dinner. We'll stop by the prefect's for coffee I'm not coming! All right, I heard you! I'll tell him we're not going! It'll just be me and you - Good evening, Rodolfo! - Good evening, Mr. Prefect I'll see you later on at my house. I'll expect you at eight We'll be there at eight sharp Where is she?

I knew it, I've got hiccups I always get them when I'm made to do something I don't want to Don't you know that it takes so little to make me happy? A chocolate ice cream is enough! Even two! A nice walk together and then whatever happens, happens Instead you... Good morning, princess! This is incredible! You owe me an explanation No, you're the one who owes me an explanation! I stop under a roof and you fall from the sky into my arms I fall off my bicycle and end up in your arms I do an inspection at school and there you are again! You even turn up in my dreams! Will you leave me alone! You've really got a crush on me! I don't blame you, but... All right, at this point, I give in. You win Where shall we go, princess? To the sea! Do you like the sea? Yes, but they're waiting for me at the theater. Take me back What's happening? Princess, do you know how to turn on the wind shield wipers? Step on the brakes! Have no fear, hang on to me! It's broken! When did you learn to drive? - Ten minutes ago! - I thought it was less than that - The top doesn't close. - The door won't open Wait, we're stuck!

Here! - Go ahead, princess. - Where are we? We've already been here Me and you? When? Don't you remember? The night it was raining... and I made you an umbrella out of a pillow! It was a beautiful night, I put the steering wheel on my shoulder... did a little waltz and when I stopped in front of you... you kissed me Princess, your behind is exposed to the wind It depends on the person. My pop was like that He had the ability to make me do anything He understood me, he knew how to deal with me I was like putty in his hand I always, always, always said yes So all these treasures you're hiding... there is a way to open this treasure chest and always get you to say yes! It's easier than you think All you need is the right key And where exactly is it? Heaven knows It's clearing up So you were saying... the key that always makes you say yes has to come from heaven Yes I'll give it a try If the Virgin Mary tosses it down to me... You never know Mary, the key! Is this it? Do you really have to go home? What about the chocolate ice cream? - Let's get it right now. - No, not now - Then when? - I don't know Are we going to let heaven decide that too? No, leave Mary alone. Don't bother her over an ice cream! No, it's much too important. We can't decide when to have it I have to ask her Mary send someone to tell us how long before we can have the ice cream! Seven seconds! - This is my house. - I've gone by here a thousand times I've always asked myself, "Who lives there?" I wanted to open my store right out front - The bookshop? - Yes, I'll see you every day Goodbye, then You've been so nice to me. All I want now is a hot bath I forgot to tell you... Go ahead You can't imagine how much I feel like making love to you But I'll never tell anyone, especially not you They'd have to torture me to make me say it Say what? That I want to make love to you Not just once, over and over again! But I'll never tell you that I'd have to be crazy to tell you I'd even make love to you now... right here, for the rest of my life You'd better run or you'll get wet. It's going to rain again Princess You're all wet My suit is no big deal It's the hat that bothers me I need a dry hat, but where can I find one? How did it go? Right, it's easy! Mary, send someone to give my friend a dry hat Goodnight, princess. Farewell Excuse me, where's the restroom? Straight ahead to the left If you don't get up immediately... I swear on your father's death bed I'll never speak to you again For the rest of my life! I'm going to count to three now If you don't get up, I'll force you to get up Good girl Do you know who's getting married? Didn't I tell you? That jerk the eggs fell on! - Who's he marrying? - I don't know But she hasn't even shown up yet! Everybody's waiting I've looked everywhere for you! - Your uncle! - My uncle? Something's happened. Come with me! Outside! The horse! What is that? Is that your horse? What a sight! What did they write on him? "Achtung, Jewish horse" The usual barbarians, vandals. It's sad. What nonsense "Jewish horse!" Don't get upset, they just did it to... They didn't just happen to do it, they did it... You'll have to get used to it, Guido... they'll start with you too With me? What could possibly happen to me? The worst they can do is undress me, paint me yellow and write: "Achtung, Jewish waiter." I didn't even know this horse was Jewish Let's go, I'll clean him up in the morning Take him back to the stall Look, there in front of you! Wait, I'll surprise her Come with me, I'd like to introduce you to Fido Giovanardi Doctor Lessing! Where are you going? Urgent telegram. I must go to Berlin immediately - What are these flowers? - They're for your departure I'll take just one I'll take it to my wife. Guido's flower! I truly enjoyed myself with you You're the most ingenious... waiter I've ever come across Thank you. You're the most-cultured customer I've ever served Thank you Goodbye, Doctor Lessing By the way... if you say my name... I'm not there anymore. Who am I? If you say my name, I'm not there anymore What is it? What did he say? Silence! Beautiful! If you say the word, it's not there anymore: Silence I'm not talking about Berlin. In the outskirts, imagine that! Third grade, listen to this problem I remember it because it shocked me A lunatic costs the State four marks a day A cripple, four and a half marks An epileptic, three marks and a half Considering that the average is four marks a day... and there are 300,000 patients, how much would the State save... if these individuals were eliminated? I can't believe this! That was my exact reaction! I can't believe a seven-year-old child... has to solve this kind of equation It's a difficult calculation. Proportions, percentages... They need at least some algebra to do those equations That's high school material for us No, all it takes is multiplication! You said there are 300,000 cripples? 300,000 times four If we killed them all, we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day It's easy! Exactly! But you're an adult, they make 7-year-old children do this in Germany! They're truly another race! Good morning, princess! - What did you say? - It's here, on the cake Why are you just standing there? Let's go! Let's go dance Just a couple things, you already know it all by now... and you've known for several years Dora and I were born on the same street...

Kiss her! Kiss her! - What's wrong with you? - Nothing - Are you all right? - Fine Who put this armchair here? Are you all right? - I'm fine - I'm sorry - I didn't get hurt - No, I was talking about - Are you enjoying yourself? - It's going fine Go back to your table Go on, I can do this Are you all right? Fine! Why are you all asking me that? Is there something wrong? No, nothing is wrong But go to the kitchen The kitchen They moved everything around tonight! Look where they put the kitchen!

Can we buy this for Mommy? - How much does it cost? - 15 lire It's a fake. It's probably a fake cake, like your tank Let's go, Joshua "No Jews or dogs... allowed." Why aren't Jews or dogs allowed to go in? They just don't want Jews or dogs to go in Everybody does what they want to There's a hardware store there... they don't let Spanish people or horses into their store Farther ahead, there's a drugstore I was with a Chinese friend of mine yesterday who had a kangaroo I said "May we?" "No, we don't want any Chinese or kangaroos here." They don't like them, what can I tell you? We let everybody into our bookshop No. From now on, we'll write it too - Is there anybody you don't like? - Spiders, what about you? I don't like Visigoths.

No, everybody stands real close together Do you see this line? I got the last tickets just in time! Hurry up, Uncle Eliseo, I don't want them to say, "Too late..." it's full, go back home." Wait up, we've got a reservation! Leave some room for us! Look at the line! Here we are! We made a reservation! Thank you! May I help you? There's been a mistake What mistake?

Go back home, ma'am I want to get on that train Let me get on that train! Mom's here! They stopped the train to let Mom get on Uncle Eliseo Are you happy? Did you see this place? Are you tired? - I didn't like the train - Me neither We'll take the bus back We're taking the bus back! The one with the seats in it! - I told them - That's better You see? It's all organized! Did you see that line! People are lined up to get inside! Everybody wants to get in! What game is this? That's it! It's that game where... It's the game... We're all players It's all organized. The game is: The men are over here, the women are over there Then there's the soldiers, they give us our schedule It's hard. You know, it's not easy If somebody makes a mistake, they get sent right home That means you have to be careful But if you win, you get first prize! What's the prize? First prize! - It's a tank - I already have one This one's a real tank! Brand new! Real? Yes! I didn't want to tell you Where's Uncle Eliseo going? He's on another team. It's all organized Bye, Uncle Eliseo! A real tank What did I tell you? Fabulous! What a place! Hurry up or they'll steal our places. We've got a reservation Two singles! Coming through! There's our place! This is our bed. We'll sleep real close It's ugly here, it smells. I want to be with Mommy We will be! I'm hungry! We'll eat! Plus they're really mean here. They yell! They yell because everybody wants first prize. They have to be tough Can I see Mommy? When the game's over When's it over? You have to get 1000 points Whoever gets 1000 points wins a tank I don't believe you. Are we getting a snack? A snack? Just ask. We're all friends here - Look who's here! What's his name... - Bartolomeo Let me ask you something Did the guy who hands out the bread and jam already come by? Darn it all! We missed him by a second! He'll come back again though, won't he? He's coming back What did he say? He asked if anyone speaks German He's going to explain the camp's rules - Do you speak German? - No The game starts now. Whoever's here is here, whoever's not is not The first one to get a thousand points wins. The prize is a tank! Lucky him! Every day we'll announce who's in the lead from that loudspeaker The one with the least points has to wear a sign saying "jackass"... right here on his back We play the part of the real mean guys who yell Whoever's scared loses points In three cases you'll lose all your points One: If you start crying Two: If you want to see your mommy Three: If you're hungry and you want a snack Forget about it! It's easy to lose points for being hungry Just yesterday I lost 40 points... because I absolutely had to have a jam sandwich Apricot jam! He wanted strawberry Don't ask for any lollipops. You won't get any We eat them all! I ate twenty of them yesterday! What a stomach ache! But they sure were good You bet! Sorry if I'm going so fast, but I'm playing hide-and-seek I have to go now, or they'll find me Don't ask me anything Ask Bartolomeo, he knows everything Don't forget to tell me what he said too A thousand points? I told you we're going to have fun! These guys are crazy! This has to weigh a hundred kilos! It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here! Vittorino, I can't cope anymore! - After only the first one? - Why, are there more to move? We're here until tonight! Bartolomeo, what happened? Where are they taking you? To the hospital. I hurt my arm We're going to die here! I can't take it anymore! I'm putting this down I'll tell them I can't do it. What can they do to me? They'll kill you! - Where does this thing go? - Down there Good Lord, I'll never make it! It's got to be 10,000 degrees in here Pop! Look here! See? It's nice, huh? We're signed up When I got there to sign up... the referee was there and he said: "No, you and your son aren't on the list... you didn't pay your dues." I almost fell over He said, "You can go home." I said, "No, you go home! Joshua and I signed up "Give me my number!" In fact, they gave me one. Look! I had them put it here too, just in case See what a nice place... your pop takes you to? Did you play with the other kids? Yes, but they don't know the rules They said it isn't true that first prize is a tank They don't know anything about the points Did you fall for that? They're as sly as foxes They want to beat you! Are you joking? There's no tank? Don't you believe them! How many points did we get today? 48, they took two points away from me because... I tripped while I was... playing hopscotch We laughed like crazy today! I died laughing! Boy, did I have fun! I can't wait to start all over again tomorrow! Hopscotch, tug of war... and ring-around-the-rosy Every game. I don't even remember all of them "You guys are obsessed. Stop, I'm tired!" I said Listen, did you eat something? Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack Good boy! That means you got 12 points too! 48 for me, 12 for you. 60 points! This is what you get when you get up to 60 A plain piece of bread, no jam Here, eat this - Is 60 points a lot? - Are you kidding? It sure is! Look who's here! Bartolomeo! How'd it go? Any worse than this... I got 20 of them We got more than him Don't tell him that. We're in the lead! I already told you, no children or old ladies! Back inside! You don't work! The rest, downstairs! Let's go, girls, quickly. Come on. This way! That one's new, she learned right away The lady at the door, she seemed nice when she first came She's the worst of all! At least she didn't send the old ladies and children to work They don't send old people and kids to work because they kill them! One of these days they'll call them to take a shower "Children, shower time!" The truth is, they make them shower there, in the gas chamber Downstairs! How can I do this? Vittorino! Where'd they find all these anvils? Pop! Why are you here? You're not supposed to be here! Go away! Why aren't you with the other kids? They said... all us kids have to take a shower today and I don't want to Go take a shower! No! I'm not going to Go take a shower! What are you doing here? We're making... the tank We're building the tank. We're still working on the tracks We're running slow You can't stay here. Go take your shower! I don't want to! You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom! Ten points off for you! Hide behind there. We'll go back together when I'm done Don't let anyone see you! This sure is fun! Everything! Take everything off! Hang it up there! You'll get it back after the shower Forward! Remember your number to get your clothes back! Women and children will shower together Are you hurt? Thanks, Bartolomeo From now on, you have to hide here the whole day If they see us now, it's over, we're disqualified! What do I have to do? You have to stay. Vittorino, help me out You have to hide here all day Don't let anyone see you, especially those mean guys who yell Remember... stay hidden! This is the hardest part If we get this right, the tank is ours, it's worth 120 points a day I'll take you with me, I'll hide you. You're gone! Who's ever seen you before? Who are you? Where is he? Got it? Gotcha! Good boy! Anybody here? Am I disturbing? Come here! Quick as lightning! Good morning, princess! Last night... I dreamt about you all night! We were going to the movies, you were wearing that pink suit... that I really like You're all I think about, princess I always think about you. And now... Mommy! Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow but he doesn't know how to drive! He kills me laughing! We're in the lead! How many points do we have today? Run! The mean guys who yell are behind us! - Where? - Over here. Over here! Are they dry? They're dry Catch Get dressed What happened to Vittorino, Alfonso and the others? They didn't make it "If you say my name, I'm not there anymore." "Silence." Thank goodness, I was getting scared What happened to you? They're half-crazy! The man who does the check-ups, the captain... he's a friend of mine. I met him when I was a waiter He said they're having a dinner with all the officials and their wives He asked me if I wanted to wait tables at the dinner Maybe he wants to help me. He might get us out of here Have you seen Joshua? What do you mean, "no"? What are you doing? Come here! No I told you to come No? Come on out! Come out! Look here, you're all dirty Where have you been? I had to finish playing rummy They make buttons and soap out of us What are you saying? They burn us all in the oven Who told you that? A man was crying. He said they make buttons and soap out of us You fell for that? Again? I thought you were a sharp boy, cunning, intelligent Buttons and soap out of people? That'll be the day! You believed that? Just imagine, tomorrow morning I'll wash my hands with Bartolomeo A good scrub... then I'll button up with Francesco Darn it all! Look! I just lost Giorgio! Does this look like a person? Come on! They were teasing you! And you fell for it! What else did they tell you? That we get cooked in the oven They burn us up in the oven You fell for that too! You just eat everything up! I've heard of a wood oven... but I've never seen a man oven before I'm out of wood! Take this lawyer! This lawyer doesn't burn, he's not dry enough! Look at that smoke! Buttons, soap, we get burned in the oven... Let's be serious now I have a bag race with the bad guys tomorrow... That's enough. I want to go home Now? Right now It's raining now. You'll come down with a terrible fever! I don't care. Let's go All right, if you want to go... I'll get our stuff and we'll leave We can leave? Naturally!

We're quitting, off the list we go Some other kid will win that real tank There aren't any other kids, I'm the only one left There aren't any more kids? It's full of them here! Where are they then?
