They're close. We got one! I'm too late! Lady Hightail, check the roof. Dolph, check the rear. You, come with me. Hotspur, you keep a lookout. Yeah, I'll just wait here in the shadows. I mean YOUR shadow. Ugh! Let's go! Ha! Wow! Flasheart! Do you have to pose like that every time? It's part of the job, brother. There's one more in there! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Roarr! I got it! I got it! Arggh! I don't got it! I don't got it! Arggh! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot! Uh, hi, Dad. What are you doing out of bed? Saving lives and being awesome, like you! Yarrgh! It's not safe for you out here, Freddy. You're not a wolf yet. But I will be in only... mmm... ..six years. And that's, like, tomorrow. How did you find us, child? Just, um, used my awesome wolf skills, Uncle Hotspur. Rarrrgh! Huh? Rargh! Oops. The moonstone ring! So this is how you tracked us down? Ohh, Freddy! You imbecile! If that falls into the wrong hands... Easy, easy! - He's just young and eager. - Young and reckless! The boy needs disciplining, Flasheart. Huh? No time for that. We've got another rescue. Can't take you home. You'll have to come. - Hey. Keep this safe, okay? - Awesome! Whoo-hoo! So cool! - And no meddling! - Oh. No meddling. Gotcha. Yes! ♪ I want to make a mess of this town ♪ I want to grow up just like you Shoo! ♪ Spend my nights out runnin' around ♪ Running wild out with my crew ♪ I'm gonna be a part of the pack ♪ The kind of boys who will have my back Hotspur! I got it! ♪ I'm gonna be a part of the pack Well done. Boop! Huh? Where'd Uncle Hotspur go? Not so high and mighty now, are we, wolfie? Dogs! Dogs! Huh? Hey? Who did this?! Gah! You little... Arggh! Dogs. I hate dogs! Werewolves. Yarrr! Rargh! Arggh! Raarrrgh... Oh, yeah. What he said. Hmm. You! I told you not to meddle! - Uh... - Whoa! My fault, my fault. I'll take him home. Aw. He's a spirited little cub. Plenty of time to learn, Freddy. I wasn't meddling, Dad. I promise. I was just trying to help. I know, I know. Your uncle's right, Freddy. You're not a wolf yet. Come on. Let's take you home. Nothing's stopping us taking a little detour. Yay! Yeah! Yes! Do you want to go faster? Oh, yeah! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! You're the best dad ever! Dad! Oh! Arggh! - What?! - Freddy! Arggh! Keep your head down. Uh... d-did you just see that, Scoops? W-was... was that a wolf abducting a little boy? Someone needs to save him! What? S-stop staring at me! Why should I go after him? Stop staring at ME! Stop staring! You go save him! Do I have to do everything myself? Okay. But you better watch my back, old friend. Now, don't you close your eyes. Dad! Why are we hiding from some ice-cream guy? Humans don't get us, Freddy. And what they don't understand, they destroy. It's better if we stay hidden. They don't scare me. I'm gonna make you so proud, Dad. Some day, I'm gonna warf into the stealthiest, biggest wolf you ever saw. Rargh raghrr! Rrrargh! - Ow! - Oops. Oh! That's great, Freddy. That's great. But listen. It's the moon spirits that decide what kind of wolves we become. Yeah? Can they hear me? Hey, spirits! It's Freddy Lupin! I want massive fangs! And night vision! And I wanna be BIG! Yeah, like, HUGE big! And with... I think they got the message. Listen. Now, the best wolves don't have the sharpest claws or the pointiest teeth. They have the biggest hearts. Now, you remember that and you'll make a great High Howler one day. Even better than you? Don't push it. You just be the best you. When I become a wolf, you'll glow for me, too. Mmm. Wish Mum was still here. Yeah, me too. Boy! Hello? Where are you? Hey, kid! A-are you there? Hello? Freddy! The moonstone! Huh? Boy! Oh! Holy chocola! You're safe. What happened to the... Oh! Oh, w... w... Wolf! Waah! Were-w-were-w-were-werewolf! Whoa. Don't freak out. I mean you no harm. Stay back! My monkey is a black belt! Hoo-ha-ha! Ha! Hi-yah! Huh? Get away from the edge! Watch out! - No! - Dad, grab him! Argh! Argh! Ahhh! - Yes! - Get away! G-get away! Stop wriggling! Freddy! Tell him I'm trying to help! He doesn't speak canine! Mister, he's trying to help you! - Bad dog! - Arggh! - Arggh! - Dad! No! No! No, Dad! Dad! No! No! No. Ah! No! No! - We have to go, Freddy! - No! We have to save him! Please, stop! - Please! Please! - No. Wait! - Stop! - Stop! No! Don't take me away! L-leave the... leave the boy alone! Huh? The pack will need a leader until Freddy's time comes. It would be my honour to serve the pack in its time of need. No. Don't put it out. What if he's still out there? We've searched everywhere, Freddy. - He's gone. - No! Gah! Found it! Whew! Game face, Freddy. Tonight's the big ni... Ah! If he's anything like his old man, he's gonna be huge. Yummy! ♪ ..singing our song ♪ Feelin' the breeze in our hair No way! ♪ Open the gates, 'cause it won't be long... ♪ The Doomwolves rocked up for my warfing? - ♪ ..will be there. ♪ - Alright!

Come on, now. The whole pack's waiting for you. They're all so excited for your big night. All except Uncle Hotspur. He says I don't have what it takes to be a High Howler. Well, only the best wolves do. I'm serious. He doesn't think I'm ready to lead the pack. Ooh. Maybe he's right. No, he's not! I'm ready. I-I know I am. Ha! That's the spirit! I remember someone else who felt just like this before his first warfing. Your father. I may not be a werewolf, but I've worked for this pack long enough to know a High Howler when I see one. That boy is just not High Howler material. This pack needs a leader who's as tough on dogs as he is brave, handsome and charming. Me! I-I'm talking about me! I've led this pack faithfully for six years. Every day, my lost dogs' home removes more filthy strays from our streets. - ♪ Who let the dogs out? - Huh? What the...?! - ♪ Who? Who, who? ♪ - Harriet! Chariot! The grown-ups are talking, petals! ♪ Who let the dogs out? ♪ Oh. I have proven myself over and over. I am your true leader. A leader who failed to retrieve the moonstone from Cripp. I've tried, believe me. Learn all about nature's greatest mistake at my Wolf-a-Torium, the world's only werewolf museum! Now with free entry? Really? No-one? Not a soul? Now! Huh? Take that, you freaks! He's armed with toxic silver dust. Oh! Feeling a little sleepy, are we? He has wolf-sensing cameras, equipped with tranquilliser darts! We've been lucky so far. Cripp has no concrete proof we exist. You've served us well, Hotspur, but it's time to make way for Freddy. I'll get the stone back. I promise you. I just need more time. ♪ When the party was nice, the party was pumping Oh! Sorry, Daddy. Our word is final. Did you get the job, Daddy? Huh. Whew! Hey, yeah! This is for you, Dad. Save me a spot up there, High Howlers of the past! Yeah! Whoo! Ha ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Alright! Whoo! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Gah! Stupid bucket! Our future pack leader, ladies and gentlemen. Go and play with your toys, kiddies. You ain't seen nothin' like me yet. Freddy out. Loser. Pfft. Whoa! - Freddy! - There he is. He doesn't look much like his father. I remember my first warfing... It's time. Let the warfing begin! Moon. Wow! Freddy Lupin, step into the light. I'm ready for this. Urgghhh! I wasn't ready for that! Whoa! Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Say hello to the big, bad wolf! What is this? Why is he a dog? - What? Huh? - Oh! It's hideous! Really? He turned into a dog? Disgraceful! - Is this a joke? - What's going on? Why is everyone looking at me funny? - Look. - Wah! Get lost, you ugly mutt! No! No-no-no-no-no! - Yes, yes, yes. - No! It's a wardrobe malfunction! Watch! I can do this! Come on, moon. Hit me! Ugh! Dude! Not cool. Ah! What's happening?! Uncle, please! The boy is cursed because he lost the moonstone ring. No. No! The moon spirits are punishing us! Wh-what? Once, we were feared beasts. Look at us hiding in the shadows! It's true. And now we're to be led by a dog! No! B-but... I AM a real wolf! Freddy. You bring shame on the memory of your father. No! This isn't me! I can't stand dogs. I don't want to hear it. You have until moonrise tomorrow to prove you are a real wolf. Otherwise the moon spirits will choose a new High Howler and you will be banished. B-but... You're too wise, Lord Hightail. Oh, Freddy! No, no, no! I'm not a dog! Grrr! Oh! Huh? Stop that! You're a wolf! 100% red-blooded wolf! Huh? I was supposed to lead them tonight. - Wow! - Huh? What a wolf! Oh, you sure showed us, Freddy! Easy, boy. - We're here to help you. - Yes, we are. Yes, we are! Stop that! Stop that! You know you want it, poody-woody. No. No, I don't. I don't want it. Fetch, boy! Gotcha! Stupid duck! Ha! Arggh! Hey! - Let me out! Let me out! - Time to die, poodle! Ribbon. - Uh, have we gone too far? - I said ribbon! He's... beautiful! Look at yourself! No! No! You are DEAD! Um, rude! Let's collar this pooch. Look. Solid silver. That'll stop you from warfing back into a boy. No, no! Get it off! Get it off! I need to warf into a wolf! Relax. Once they make Daddy High Howler, we'll let you go. If you're a good doggie. Get it off! No! Whoa! - He's getting away! - No! No! Get me outta here! It's okay. I'll just post an SOS to my followers. There's no reception! What do you mean, there's no reception? Nobody can contact me?! Nobody can contact me! How much worse can it get?! D'oh! I had to ask! Get off! Really?! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Mrs Mutton? Oh, Dad. How do I fix this? Huh. The moonstone. If I return it to the pack, I'll break the curse! Ha ha! Yes! Huh? Ohh! Ha ha! Oh! Whoa! Ugh. Alright, poodle. It's showtime. Ha ha ha! Huh? Whoaaa! Oof! Oh! Huh? Wha... wha... what? Ha! You've got a mean jump. For a poodle. Whoa! Whoa! Amazing! Delicious! Must... engage... enemy! Brrr! No. No! No, no, no! Get a grip. You're better than that. Die, kitty! Wahhh! Aahhh! Yow! Ow! Ohhh! Ugh. Stupid! What's wrong with me? I'm a boy. A rational, intelligent... Huh? Arggh! Stop! Watch out! Get off the road, dog! Whoooaaa! Whoa there! Wahhh! You in a hurry to see the big kennel in the sky? Ugh! Dog! Get away from me! Gah! Easy, easy, boy. First time off the leash, huh? - Wha...? - Don't worry. The name's Batty. I'm going to save you. What? No! I don't need anyone to save me. Aargh! O... kaayyy. You have three seconds and I'm gone. Follow me. Nose to butt! Wait! Stop! - Whoa! Yuck! - Too much nose! Too much butt! Okaayyy. Let's go, pinky. Come on. Wait! Yes. That's it. Keep following me. Ha! I'm not following. You're just in my way! Well, we're both in the way of THAT! No way. I did it. Ha! I did it! YOU did it? Last time I checked, I saved YOU, poodle! - I'm not a poodle. - Really? What, then? Labradoodle? Cavoodle? Spoodle? Whoa! Get away from my butt, weirdo! You smell weird. Kinda like a poodle, mixed with something... - No, no. N-n-n-n-no. - ..something wild. Stop it! I'm not any kind of 'oodle, I'm a boy. A human? Yep. Wow. Someone's been spending too much time with his master. Gah! Why am I explaining myself to a dog? Just... Look, just stay. Did you just tell me to stay?! Uh... No. Uh... maybe. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. W-wh-whoa there. Sit. Sit. "Sit"?! You better run along before you get hurt, poodle! I'm not a poodle. Human. See? Two legs? Whoa! Yep. Uh, did you hit your head or something? Ah. Always good to stretch before a walk. Aaand here I go. - Dah! - Seriously, do you need help? - Do I look like I need help? - Uh, okay. Last chance, lapdoodle. Yes or no? Er, no! Poodles! Oh! Well, at least I don't sniff butts! Stupid dog. Huh? What did you call me?! Er... nothing. You wanna piece of me? Huh? Huh? Huh? Yikes! What are you looking for, sport? I've got bones. Squeaky toys. Fresh shoes still in the box. Uh... Not interested. Thank you. Ugh! - Uh! - Hey! I'm marking here! Show some respect! O... kay. Um... Ugh. So, I've been thinking... Uh-huh. That must have hurt. ..and I've decided to let you help me. If... you know, if... if it makes you feel better. Beat it, pinky. I'm trying. It's just those dogs won't let me. Well, duh! That territory's marked. You gotta take the pee-free route. The... the what? You really have no idea, huh? I need to get to this guy. A human. Whoa! Agh! Wow. Excellent story. Whaa! So, this guy... Ow! ..his name's Foxwell Cripp. He sells ice-cream out of a van. The werewolf hunter? That weirdo's your master? Gah, no! He's my worst enemy. Really? What'd he do? Break your hair curler? He killed my dad, okay? Ah... Oh. And he stole something from him that I have to get back. I'm... sorry. Really. But... I roam alone. I've got meat. Hmm. I'm listening. At my house. A whole room full of. Chops. And steaks. Sausages. You get me to Cripp and it's all yours. And why should I trust you? Well, because a wollll... Because... I never lie. Hmm. Okay. I'll bite. Wha...? You'll help me? Sure. If you can keep up! Arggh! You won't get away this time, Houndini! Heyyyy-yah! Yeah! Not for a 47th night in a row! Hyaaaaa-ha! Sorry. Ha!

Whew! Okay, Freddy. Last lesson. Werewolves are evil! What? Says who? Um, just every dog ever. Werewolves run around at night pretending to help people, but they're really stone-cold psychos who sacrifice puppies to their moon god! W-what? They drink blood at night and sleep in freaky coffins during the day. That's not true! I don't know where you're getting your information from, but werewolves are... Why are you defending them? Are you some kind of wolf-lover or something? Huh? Wha... Uh... Because if you are, you're on your own, buddy. Wh...? No, no, no, no, no, no. No. Werewolves? Yuck! Hate those freaks. Uh... Mm-hm. Lock your doors, people! Check under your beds! The full moon is here and the werewolf horde is upon us! Um... Can I just pay for my boysenberry swirl? Oh! Alright! - You're nuts, man. - Come back soon! I've got a new salted caramel fudge coming out next week! Hello? Hello? Oh... Nuts? Really? Ho ho! Do I look nuts to you? Hmm? Do I? Huh? "No. You're the smartest man I know." Oh, thank you. "And you smell nice." Oh! That is nice of you to say. Oh! You're my best pal! This is it. Good luck. Wh...? - You're not coming? - Hey. Deal was I get you to Cripp, you give me meat. Uh, didn't say anything about me going into that, uh... freaky wolf show. Wha...? But I thought you and me... I told you. Yeah, yeah. You work alone. Got it. - Typical dog. - Pfft! Huh? Feed me children! Oh! Whoa! Yes! No way! This is way too easy! Oops. Ha ha ha! Wh-wh-what? It's fake? No. No! No, no, no, no! Oh! Oh, you pink little hooligan! What have you... What in the waffle? That ring's mine! Hmm? What ARE you? Hmm. Let's have a little look-see, shall we? Hush, puppy! We just want to see what flavour canine you are. Say hello to our guest, Scoops. "Hey there, pal. "Just do what he says. He's coo-coo." Er... Huh? Oh! Whaa! Let me go! Oh! Oopsy! Oh, I'm sorry. Er, let's give you a little scan. It won't hurt a bit! Whoa! Whoops! Arggh! Er, wrong button. Do you know why I got into ice-cream? For the friends. Everyone loves the ice-cream man, right? Wrong! It's the delicious cones they come for. Not me. No-one ever asks Foxwell Cripp about his day. The night I saw that boy get eaten, I figured finally people would start paying attention to me. No-one got eaten! I AM that boy! I tried to warn them. But they wouldn't listen, would they? No! They called me 'Flake-head' and 'Coo-Coo Cripp' and 'Foxwell Farty Poop Scoop'! But I'll expose the werewolf pack if it's the last thing I do! And then we'll see who Mr Popular is! Hee hee hee hee! Ha ha ha! Hmm. Sweet Neapolitan! According to my lupometric analysis, you're one scoop poodle, one scoop boy and one... wolf?! Who owns you? Ooh! You devil! - Scoops, heads up! - Huh? What? Ooh. What do we have here? Oh! We're closed! What?! Huh? Hmm. Oh. Is THIS how you make ice-cream? Batty! How did you...? - Wow. - Hooligans! What the caramel fudge?! - This tastes disgusting! - Batty, look out! Hey! Come back here! What the...?! Oh! Ah! - Whoa! - What's going on? Wha...?! Ah! Batty! W-w-w-w-w-whoa there! No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Ah! Whoa! Arggh! Oh! Scoops, I've got you! Whoa! Scoops! - Whoa! - Yeah! Ha ha! Hold him, Scoops! - Run, Freddy! - Not yet. Whoa! Nice! Arggh! Got it! My knower-glower! No! No! - Yeah! - Stop! Whoa! Don't you judge me! Where were you?! Huh? Wait a minute. I've seen that crest before. Lupin. Freddy! Freddy! Come on, now, Freddy. Out you come. A High Howler doesn't hide from his problems, you know. Oh, poor boy. He must be so upset right now. We did it! Boom! That's what I'm talkin' about! Did you see his face? He was like, "Blurgh!" Wow! Batty, you were fierce in there. So were you! Mm... Mmm... uh... I-I mean, uh... for a poodle. Thanks, uh... partner. Uh, I wouldn't go that far. Sorry. Teammate? Mmm... stop being weird. Okay. Paaaaal? Why don't you be a paaaaal and take me to the meat? Uh, yeah. Uh... hmm. About that, um... hmm. Uh, about what? What's the problem? Uh... hmm. It's kinda complicated. Mmm, "room full of meat"? "All you can eat"? Sounds pretty uncomplicated to me. No... No... You don't understand. Mmm... the thing is... ..right now's not the best time for me to bring home a... dog. I get it. You're a hoity-toity purebred who looks down his snout at strays like me! What? Huh? Oh... no, I didn't mean it like that. Played by a poodle? I'm such an idiot! Batty! Batty! Wait! Batty? Batty? I'm sorry. Batty? Where are you? Batty. Get lost. You got your dumb ring. Wh... what is this place? What does it look like? My home. Don't feel bad. It's not the first time I've been ditched. You think you're so special. I was supposed to have an owner too. And a house. With kids. And toys. I want that one. Good luck, girl. Oh, Batty. I'm sorry. The reason I can't take you home, it's... ..it's not you, it's my family. The truth is, you see... I'm a... ..I'm a werewollllll... ..bl... ergh. I'm a werewo... ..ooh. A what? I'm a werew-w-w... wuh! You're a were...? I'm awaaaaaare... I hurt your feelings? Who am I kidding? You know what I am? I'm a screw-up. That's why my family doesn't want me. Not like this. Like what? Spit it out. This! A stupid fluffy poodle! They're all so big and fierce with their claws and shiny coats. That's why I've got to take this ring back. Then they'll take me seriously. See that I'm good enough. You think I'm a weirdo, huh? Uh, hello! Yes! Freddy, it doesn't matter how big or strong you are, or if you bring home some ring. It's about what's inside you. In here. My dad used to say something like that. Bet my version's better. Huh? Huh? Eh, it was okay. - Ha ha! Houndini! - Arggh! - Ha ha! - Gotcha now! Let go of her! Ha ha! Two-for-one deal! No! Let me out! - Hey, you! Let me out! - Let us go! Months, I've avoided these guys. One day with you and I'm busted! No dog has ever come out of this place. Oh, come on. It can't be that bad. It's okay. It's okay. We can handle this. What was that?! Okay. We'll make a break for it. Run, Batty! Run! - Run! - Ugh! Oh! Get this thing off of me! Arggh! I just had this dry-cleaned! Ugh! Now I've got dog filth all over it! Ooh, please, master! I will lick your noble face clean! Oh! No! Ugh! Put that tongue away from me, you slobbery mongrel! Ungrateful little savages! Here I am giving them a purpose in life and what does it get me? Oh! Look what you did! You made the master sad! That makes me mad. And when I get mad... Hey, boss? You're not gonna believe who they caught. The Great Houndini! All that fuss over a scruffy piece of fur barely worth the time. Your friend, on the other hand... - Hmm. Very interesting hair. - Wh... wha...? Put them in the poochy salon. Huh? Ow! Ooh! Huh? No! Get away! Huh? Ugh! Ooh! Mmm! Aaaah... Huh? Wha...? Gets them every time! Next! Whoa! You've got mail. Don't think I'm soft on dogs, Lord Hightail... ..just because my nephew's a poodle. Hotspur? Hotspur? Oh. I just, uh, saw something funny. Sorry. About those dogs at Coldfax. We're working on a much more permanent solution to the city's stray dogs problem. I don't care about the city dogs! I care about one dog who's supposed to be a wolf! What's going on with Freddy? Hello there, Hotspur Lupin! I've got a cone to pick with you! Oh, keep away from me, Cripp! A poodle stole my ring! What's that got to do with me?! I intend to find out! It had your crest on its collar! - It was a targeted attack! - Out. Okay! Thank you! What the...?! Oof! A poodle stole his ring! Huh! Freddy? Hotspur! What the blazes is going on?! Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. No, what? No, you're breaking up. I can't hear you. No... Get me to Coldfax! Now! Get your mitts off me! You can't do this to us! You animals! Is it really you? No! It can't be! - Oh! - Ball? Houndini?! And Freddy Lupin. Uh, we're a... we're a team. I thought you ran alone, Houndini. It's complicated. Name's Twitchy. Top dog around here. You? But... but you're so... ..little. Did you just call me little?! Erm... no? Maybe just a teeny bit. Teeny? Teeny?! I will end you! I was the biggest in my litter, you know! Whoa there, Twitch. Whoa. Easy, lass. - Look into my eyes. - Grrr! Look at me. Loooook. Ah, that's better. Remember our anger management mantra? Say it! I'm a... golden... ray of sunshine. And? Perfect in every way. "And as I warm the daisies"? Hmm? And I bid them all good day. You know that literally makes no sense, right? Are you still angry? No... Okay. You're forgiven. For now. Hey. Name's Hamish. Pack psychologist, uh, naturopup, shaman, healer of ills, friend. - Hey. - Hmm. This bruiser here, he's called Bruno. - Ball. - All he says is "ball". Okay. Well, make yourselves at home. Oh, no, no. I-I need to get out of here. Hmm. Where does this lead to? - Ball! - No! Are you crazy?! That's where the dog-eating dungeon ogre lives! Dog-eating what?! Nobody gets out of here. Believe me, we've tried everything. Whoo! Freedom! Oof! Ball. Whoo! Freedom! - Whoo-hoo! - Here we go! Ow! Okay, obviously you've never worked with Freddy Lupin and the Great Houndini. Give me 24 hours. I'll find a way. 24 hours?! I don't have that long! I need to get home. I need time to think. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Okay, agree. That's great. Cool. Okay. So... have you thought about it yet? No. How about now? No. - How about now? - No! How about now? How about no? - How about now? - Yes! - Really?! - No. Yes. - Huh? - She's in here. - Uncle Hotspur?! - "Uncle"? The red wolf! Grrrr! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle, you came to get me! I can't believe it! Yes. That's the one. Heh heh! It's a pity to lose it. One of our more unique-looking specimens. You go on. I just need a moment. You have the moonstone, yes? Where is it? Whoa! You won't believe how we got it! You've done well, boy. It wasn't just me. It was Batty too. Whoa, wait. I can't leave my friend Batty. Don't worry. You won't. In fact, you can stay here with her. For good. What? No! I-I need to come home and return the moonstone. Then I'll be wolf-worthy. Right? Come, now, Freddy. Nothing can fix you. You're just not wolf material. Yep, you're right. The poodle's too valuable to lose. Keep it. No! No, no! Uncle! Uncle! Lucky brat. I've got a big surprise for you. Wh... what? Take her away! Wait! No, no! Uncle! When the time comes, all you have to do is press this button. Excellent. I want the machine up and running tonight. But... b-b-but we still have some kinks. Unkink them! It must be tonight! Yes, sir. Unkink yourself, you ungrateful pustule! He left me. I... I mean... I can't believe... He left me! Um, how is your uncle a werewolf? Uh... um... Man, this must be one of those strange new crossbreeding programs. Who ARE you? WHAT are you? Batty... I tried to tell you. I don't understand. I was supposed to be a werewolf. Not this. Not some... ..some fluffy pink joke. Oh, my gosh. It all makes sense. I knew you smelled funny. That's why you acted so weird! But, Batty, it's still me inside. You lied to me. I trusted you. Maybe THAT'S why your family doesn't want you. Because you... you hurt them. - Batty... - Stay away from me! Hmph! In one moment, the Whizzer-Fizzer will give us the answers we've been looking for. Hee hee hee! Some raspberry juice. One pink poodle curl. One ginger whisker. Oooh! Oh, Scoops! You've contaminated the Whizzer! Ooh, this is getting interesting! Here it comes. Here it comes! Oh! He's a werewolf! Hotspur is a werewolf! Scoops! We've found one! Wh-what now? "He'll lead us to the others, "and then we get them all." Oh, Scoops! I've always said it. You are the brains of this operation. Hmm. Ball. I'm a golden ray of sunshine. That's right. I'm one with the universe. Daisies. Daisies. Daisies... Din-dins! - Don't touch my bone! - Mine! Mine! Ball! Ball! Have you got an idea? Anything I can do? Yeah. Stay outta my way. - Bruno? - Ball! Hee-ya! Ha! Yes! Arggh! I'm too big! Twitchy, I need you to wriggle out and press that button. - Huh? - Where's my bone?! Why me? Um... well... ..uh, because you're so... Brave. Because you're so brave. Yeah. That's true. I don't need YOUR help. - Can you reach? - Pfft. Course I can reach! Oh! Grrr... Uh, don't worry, guys. That was just a practice run. Here we go! Hyaahhhhhh! Whoo-hoo! Uh-oh. Gah! Okay. Did you push the RED button?! I'm colourblind! I can't see red! I thought she saw red all the time. I think someone's coming! What the heck is going on out there?! - The Commander! - Suck it in! Oof! Who's trying to escape?! Cerberus! Sniff out the culprit. There's only one mutt crazy enough to do something like this! - Me. - You? - Freddy, no. - It's my fault. All of it. I was trying to escape. You haven't got the guts, poodle! Oh, really? Cerberus? Why is it walking toward me? Try it, squeaky toy. Arggh! No! No! Not this way! Not over here! What, NOW you pee in public?! I can't stop it! I've been holding it in too long! Bruno, no! It's not a sprinkler! Aim the other way! Aim the other way! - Freddy! No! - Help! Help! Oh! Waaah! Oooh! - Arggh! - Whoa! Whoops. Cerberus! Throw him in with the beast! Wait - "beast"? The... the dungeon ogre? Bye-bye, pinky. I'm sorry. Freddy! Eh, boy, wolf, poodle - kid's got guts. And an overly large bladder. Whoa! Whoooaaa! Enjoy your new cellmate, pinky. Try not to squeal. It just makes the beast angrier. Wait! What have I done? Ah, yes, uh, Lord Hightail, just a little tinkle to reassure you that I have the Freddy situation under contr... Ow! Great hairy snotballs! What do you want, you old gargoyle?! Uh, oh, no, sorry, Your Lordship. No, not you. Hello? Hello? Have you found Freddy? Uh, no. Uh, can't say that I have. That's it! I'm calling the police! No need, Mrs Mutton. I was speaking to the chief of police just now. We've got the whole town out looking for him. Well, no harm in one more set of eyes. No need. Freddy knows he has to be back by moonrise tonight to prove he's wolf-worthy. The best thing you can do is to make sure that everything is ready for the big night. Oh, dear. Fine. Excellent. ♪ You got me hurryin' all over the town ♪ No need to worry ♪ 'Cause you know that I won't let you down ♪ You know that I won't let you down. ♪ No-one has ever done anything like this for me. Eh, I'm sure he's fine. Oh, but what if he's not? There's a terrible beast down there! But wait - he tried to tell me he wasn't a dog. But he forgot to mention the small but huge detail that he's a WEREWOLF! But he did take the blame for you, like a true friend would. True friend. Why are you just standing around? Come on, come on! We've gotta go save Freddy! Come on! Okay. Glad that you're in touch with so many of your feelings. See? It's always good to vent. Yes! Vent! Oh, ha ha! You're a genius! Yeah. That was a good idea. Bruno, really?! A closed space? Whew! Commander. The machine is up and ready. Prime the turbines. Run final tests. The de-frizzer. The compressor. And the final trim. Open suction tubes. In ugly... ..out fabulous! On stand-by for pooch intake. Wha...?! No! Please! Don't eat me! Help! - Help! - Freddy! Come in, come in. Welcome back. Tonight's the night! - Uh-huh? - We're good to go. All you have to do is press the button. Oh, I intend to. This had better work, Commander. For your sake. Arggh! Whoa! Okay, fine! Do it! Eat me! - Just make it quick! - Yuck! Huh? I don't eat dog. Filthy animals! What? You speak? What are you doing here, mutt? Me? W... well... - Whoa! - Where did you steal this?! That belonged to my dad! Whoa! No. No, it... ..it can't be! Uh... That's... It's... It's not possible! F-Freddy? Huh? Uh, what... Dad?! Oh, Dad! - No. No. - It's you! My... my Freddy is... is 100% wolf. It... it's me. Dad! - What...? Oh, Freddy! - Dad! - Dad! Dad! - Oh, Freddy! Freddy! I thought you were dead. Oh! So did I. Ooh! Ooh! My strength was fading. But I had to get home. To you, Freddy. Even down here, I didn't lose hope. I knew they'd come looking for me. Uh... Huh? Wax my whiskers! You're alive! You had your turn, brother. It's mine now. Huh? Silver? Just in case. No! And I've been down here in the dark ever since. So, uh... you're a... poodle now? Uh... um... What, this old thing? Nah. It's just a disguise to get in here and fix the... Yeah. I'm a poodle. I'm sorry. I know it's not what you wanted. But... you know what? Dogs are actually the kindest, most thoughtful creatures I ever met. I wish you could meet them. - Whoa! - Huh? Whoa! Oh! Ow! Oh, it's the beast! Oh, he's hideous! Get off me! Guys... Oh! - Whoa! - Ugh! Oh! He tried to eat me! You monster! You'll pay for this! - Ow! - Eat this! - Guys! - No! What is it? All units to the puppy pit! We have a Code Rex! I repeat, Code Rex! ♪ Once I've got you, we'll make our escape ♪ Freedom bound, you know that I won't let you down ♪ I won't let you down! ♪ Guard the machine, Cerby. Do not leave that spot! Uh... - Dad! - Freddy, no! - Don't hurt them! - Oof! Ball! Huh? Oh! Yeow! Stop it! Stop it! Dad, these are my friends. Guys, my dad. No freakin' way! Oh, yeah. I can see the resemblance. - These are your friends? - Kind of. You all came back here to save my son? Yeah! From you! They must be down here! Uh-oh. That doesn't sound good. We've got to get out of here. The Commander's built some machine to turn us into weird fur nests to go on human heads! Fur nests? When the time comes, all you have to do is press this button. Excellent! Wigs! They're gonna turn us into wigs! - Uncle Hotspur's gone insane! - Huh? He has the remote to turn the machine on! We've gotta stop him! That conniving weasel! Guys, let's help him. - Sure. - Yeah. Okay, Dad, help us up here. - Yeah! - Ha ha! Alright. Let's get out of here. Whoa! Oh, no. The other way! Hmm? Heeeeeeya! And who do you think you are? Ah. I'm the housekeeper. Freddy! Master Flasheart?! Flying furballs! - You're alive! - Mm-hm. Grab 'em! No dog escapes tonight! We'll see about that! Hwoaa! Hi-ya! You get to the warfing! Stop your uncle before he can become High Howler! Don't worry. She's got this. - What are you fools doing?! - Go, Freddy! Go! Huh? Twitchy? It's okay. You do your thing and I'll do mine. Rowrrrrrrrr! You come back here! Taste my Mutton Chop! Bring it on, old biddy! - Yah! Yah! - Ha ha! So, what's the plan? We kick Uncle Hotspur's butt! After that? You get the magic rock and turn into a wolf? Uh, something like that. Too bad. The poodle was growing on me. Whoa! Arggh! Arggh! Ahhh! Ha ha! Whoo! We did it! Whoa! Uh, what is wrong with you? Oh, yeah. It's the sunlight. Glpp-ughh... This is getting a little weird even for me. Don't worry. It's perfectly natural-l-l-l-l! Does he have worms? Tell me when I can open my eyes! Ha! Yes! Yes! It's okay! I'm a boy! You can look now! Really? Oh, whoa! - Sweet mother of pups! - That is not okay. - Wieners! - Huh? Get your wieners! No! Huh? No! Happens to the best of us, son. - Why didn't YOU change? - This. Hey, pinky! Uh, are we going or what? Hey, let's go. We'll find you some clothes on the way. Yes! Oh! Are you kidding me?! Uh-oh! Er... Nah. No dogs in here. Just Cerby. Keep searching! Cerby! Huh? Huh? Oof! Huh? Oof! Oof! Yah! Hi-yah! - Ya! Ya! - Get back here! Where's Freddy? Where is he? I don't think he's coming. Order. Order. For the first time in history, this pack finds itself without a High Howler. Freddy Lupin has not proven himself wolf-worthy, so we must call upon the moon spirits to choose a new... No need to bother the spirits, Lord Hightail. My friends, my family, I have returned the sacred moonstone! Lost by the pretender Freddy Lupin! I am your true High Howler! He brought the ring back. That does make him High Howler. Step into the light and join me, brothers and sisters! Tonight, we run wild and free! No! This is the birth of a new era. In honour of the event, I've prepared a little surprise for you all. I give you the Puppy Muncher! Our path to a dog-free world! Oooh! Oh. This is getting a bit too wild for me. Does he mean to kill them? Oh! You flatter me. I don't know where my brilliance comes from. I really don't. Goodbye, doggies! Did you think a poodle was too stupid to get out of that prison? - It's him! - It's Freddy! Well, who looks stupid now? Huh? What? He looks ridiculous. Is he meant to be our High Howler? Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball! - Dogs! - Get out! You're too late, dog. I'm High Howler now. I brought the moonstone back to the pack. You're a liar! I got the moonstone back from Cripp. YOU left me and my dad in a dungeon to rot! - But Flasheart's dead. - What is he talking about? Get this abomination and his filthy mutts out of our sacred hall. They're with me! Flasheart! - He's alive! - It's him! How did you get... Er... I mean... you're alive! Yes, brother. My son freed me. It wasn't just me. My friends helped. - Dogs helped? - They saved Flasheart? Freddy! Watch out! Ah! - Cripp! - What's he doing here? Ah! The elusive werewolf pack. Hiding in plain sight for all these years. Hope you like my new flavour - Super Silver Surprise! Silver! Have a nice nap! Watch out! Dad! Run! You had enough? Do you want more? Oof! Oof! Oof! Stand still! Who wants more?! Dad! He's alive. The silver knocked him out. Nap time, wolfies! I need to stop Cripp! You go. We'll help the werewolves. Nighty-night! Get 'em, Scoops! They might be big, ugly freaks, but they are Freddy's family. Welcome to your new life as exhibits in my Wolf-a-Torium! Cripp! Enough! - Sleepy bye-byes! - Stop! Stop it! What are you doing in here, boy?! Get out of h... You're the boy! But... you got eaten! I'm avenging you against these beasts! They're not beasts. They're my family. Uh... uh, but... but... Enough of this! No! These dogs are mine! Missed me! No! My collection! Hiii-ya! Nooooo! Go, Freddy! She needs more time! Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Ooh... hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Oof! No! Whoa! Whoa! The pack will thank me for this. No! No! Mr Ruffles! That was Siberian husky! Let's end this! No! No! No, no, no, no, no! Noooo! Nooooooooooo! Arggh! Oof! Ah! No! A-bye-bye, little rat! Little rat! Ooh! Little rat! Little rat! Little rat! Little rat! "Little rat"?! You call me little?! Arggh! Okay, good doggie! I'm not bad anymore! I'm sorry! Ha ha! Whoo-hoo! We did it! Yikes! Whoa! Daddy! Daddy, Freddy locked us in the attic and... - Worst thing ever! - ..and my phone didn't work! I need a new phone NOW! Right now, Daddy! Ah. Cool. Reception. Have a nice day, Daddy. Ha! Yes! Moonlight! Yikes! Huh? Whoa! Whoa! There's no point running, boy! Whoa! Freddy! Wake up! Wake up! Gah! Come on, you big lump! Huh! That kind of felt good. Ha! Yeah. Go ahead. Step into the moonlight. You'll never be a match for me. Maybe not as a boy. Come on, Freddy. This is your big moment. Hmm? They believe in me! Huh? I know what I am now. Huh? Wow. A poodle?! No! A WEREpoodle! Go, son! Arggh! Whoa! Get your hands off me! You can't lock me up like a filthy animal! Looks like everyone got what was coming to them. Discrimination! Welcome to Farfang Manor. Unlike my uncle, our pack now see worthiness in dogs. Well, I guess the dogs see some in him too. - Finished! - Ugh! - Oh! - Eww! A scrumptious Steak-Swirl for you. One Choco-Sausage-flavoured scoop for you... Ohh, you little cutie! "Little"?! "I'm a silver ray of moonlight." Moon. Ball. Ball! Batty? I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! Eeeeeee! Since my dad's back, I guess that means I don't need to be a High Howler - yet.
