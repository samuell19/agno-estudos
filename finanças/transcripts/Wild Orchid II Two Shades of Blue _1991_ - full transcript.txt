Ain't she something? Yeah, I was blowing through a town like this when I met your mom the first time. Never even talked to her. She was just standing out in front of a little white house, smiling as I drove by. Then what? - Oh, you've heard this story a million times. - Tell me again. Well, (SIGHS) beautiful girl, started haunting me. I played her face over and over again in my head. A month later I came back, gave her a piggyback ride straight to hell. Hmm, you only saw her once? Once. And that was enough to know? I knew. Yeah, I use to feel terrible dragging you around from town to town, but I swear you're better off for it, you're better educated. (BELL TOLLING) SNOOKEY: Morning, Colonel. Hey, Snookey! - Fill it up for me, huh? - Yes, sir! Give her a shine, we'll pick her up after church. Come on, May. Come on, Son. You probably think I'm just a regular kid on his way to church with his parents, but what I really am is an escaped convict from the prison down the road. COLONEL: Joshua! Now! You know, there was a time early on before prison, I was a horn player. Sort of a child prodigy. That kind of means divinely gifted. You probably think I'm crazy, but I'm not. Guilty, yes, crazy, not. If you were locked up, you'd try and escape, too. COLONEL: Joshua! The problem with escaping is they always come after you. They don't if you're lucky. Uh, who was that you were talking to? Just some horn player. Yeah, I thought he was hearing it. - Hearing what? - The beat. Is that good or bad? Oh, that's good, honey, that's good, yeah, that's excellent. You know what I mean, you gotta be a little extraterrestrial these days, otherwise you wind up being a lawyer or a banker or something like that. Hmm. That boy's got it, he's tuned in. Yeah, he's headed for the moon. (CAMERA CLICKING) (CROWD APPLAUDING) (HAM COUGHING) (GASPING) - You need help. - No. (COUGHING) Oh, God, it's Jules. I can't... (COUGHS) Oh, I can't let him see me like this. If we lose this gig, money's gone. No clubs worth a damn. You gotta go out there and tell him. Don't let him see me like this. Tell him anything... Tell him... Tell him... (COUGHING) (YELLS) Tell him! He's got the flu. It came out of nowhere. He'll be all right in a day or two, he'll make it up to you. He's so sick. I really don't know what to do. Sure you do, honey. You know as well as I do what he needs. Where do I get it? No problem. You got the money? No. Now, that's a problem. I can work for you. Wait tables. Around here, you gotta be 21 if there's liquor on the premises. Then give him an advance. I already did. I paid him half when I booked him. Don't play games with me, Jules. If you got something on your mind, say it. You ever been with a man? No. (DOOR OPENS) Come here, I wanna show you something. Your dad and me go back a long time. That's your mom. And that's you. BLUE: Can I have it? Can I have the picture? Can I have the picture? There's a robe on the back of the bathroom door, you can use it if you want. I don't think so. I'm afraid if I go in there, I'd lock the door and never come out. You might not like looking at me, but I love looking at you. The first time I was with a woman, we did it just like this. Wasn't planned, we just, uh, sort of took off our clothes, and lied down and stared at the ceiling for a while. I'm cold. I'll warm you up. How long have you known? Let's not talk about it. We never have before, so let's not start now. I tried to quit. A thousand times. So? So I'm going to try again. When? Soon as we're out of here. Jules may have been my angel of mercy last night, but he's gonna come collecting this morning. (SIGHS) I know him well enough to know that. If he's your friend, why couldn't he give you something for old times sake. (HAM COUGHS) Did you ask him? Did you ask him why he had a picture of your mother up there where he could see it all these years? In his office, his bedroom. What were you doing up there? What were you doing up there, Blue? What were you doing in his bedroom? You wanna talk about it, fine. Let's talk about it. Don't you think I know what goes on in every bathroom and in every parking lot of every club you play in? (CLATTERING) (YELLING) What were you doing up there, Blue? What were you doing in his bedroom? I spared your mother, but goddamnit, I couldn't spare you! Goddamnit! Stop it! No! Get off him! Get off him! Don't you come near me, I'll knock your fucking head off! I'm not the problem here, you know it. You eat shit! (COUGHING) Get out! Get out! Gotta play. Gotta pay the damages. You know, it's something I would have done sooner or later anyway. It's part of growing up. I think what some people do is they pretend they're in love to just kind of justify it. Not me, uh-uh. I'm not gonna bullshit myself. Never have, never will. I love you. I know. I know. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (WHIMPERS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BLUE SCREAMS) (SIRENS WAILING) (GOSPEL SONG PLAYING) (SINGING) I'm Elle. A friend of Jules. I'm truly sorry about your father. I didn't really know him, but I did have the pleasure of hearing him play over the years. I've always wondered what it would be like to have this kind of poetry rattling around inside your soul. What do you want? The question is, Blue, what do you want? Do you have a place to spend the night? Do you have any family, any friends you can go to? Any way of earning a living? You could stay on here and clean motel rooms. I'm sure Jules would grant you that favor. In return for other favors, of course. Or if you're strong enough, brave enough, you can come with me, work for a short time and have everything you ever wanted. What does Jules get out of this? More than the cost of a plate? More than the cost of 10 plates? Hey! You still ahead of the game, Jules? You still making a profit? Are you crazy? Are you fucking crazy? Fucking whore. Just like your mother. What did you say? You heard me. I give him 10 % of whatever you earn for the first six months. Who do you think paid for your father's casket? And who do you think is going to pay for the windows? I'm offering you a home, Blue. I think you need one. Take off your coat, Blue. Your opportunities here are boundless. Your only limits are your own moral qualms, and perhaps your stamina. Though in your case, I plan to use you selectively. Take off the rest of your clothes and step into the shoes by the window. Beautiful. Aren't they? Everything here is. The finest French wines, waterford crystal goblets, Egyptian cotton sheets pressed to perfection. See my clients are used to the very best. So are my girls. I've asked you to take off your clothes, Blue. Is this really necessary? Mary, it seems Miss McDonald has changed her mind, would you please show her to the door? I haven't changed my mind. I know exactly what I want, and I know exactly why I'm here. Hide your emotions. There's no shame here. You're an actress, the role you play is your shield, your armor. If you don't like the situation you're in, then become someone who does. ELLE: Perfect. Always in blue. Blue gowns, blue shoes, blue handbags, that will be your signature. Dominique was trained in Paris. Watch her. Watch her undress. Her technique is impeccable. Deliberate. Sensuous. Soft. Watch her. Watch her eyes. Long hard looks with just the hint of a smile. Naked women sitting on straight backed chairs. What could be more beautiful? Elle wants to see you. Put a robe on and come down just the way you are. ELLE: This will never happen again, will it? (SOBBING) MONA: No, never. You're no longer the baby of the house, Mona. We have a new baby. This is Blue. Come into the office, Blue, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Blue, this is Captain Edwards. How old are you, honey? She's 18, aren't you, dear? You got some identification? Birth certificate, drivers license? Anything with a date of birth on it? Do you, Blue? Now, that could be a problem. It' important to know who your friends are. See there are no witnesses here. Only co-conspirators. You understand? Maybe. But don't you ever hit me. I'm sure I'll never need to. No. Hey! Wanna meet some of the girls? That's Celeste. She's from Martinique by way of Selma, Alabama. She's got a real pretty voice, you should hear her sing. This is Judy and Suzy. They always work as a team. Look at that guy, he's a regular, he likes to pretend he's dead. (BLUE LAUGHS) Hey, you like Elvis? Mmm-hmm. I fucked him. Well, not really him, just somebody that dressed like him. - (BLUE LAUGHS) - (SHUSHES) But it affected me the same, I swear it did. That's Del. All she does is laugh, and cry, and dance. I was tricking out of my mama's house for pocket change when Elle discovered me. And when she asked me to go with her, I said, "You must be crazy. I mean, I ain't got no tits or nothing." She said, "Honey, what most guys want is exuberance," whatever that means, "and you've got that in spades." This is Ruth. She sort of handles the rough trade, but you'd never know in real life, though, 'cause she's so sweet. RUTH: Bernard, you're a very naughty boy. And bad boys have to be punished. (MAN GROANS) God. (GIGGLES) That's Dominique. Watch her face. She's like me. She loves what she does. There's something about passion. Real passion that just does it to me every time. So, what did Mona show you that made you run away? Hmm? Nothing. You know, there are so many different kinds of love. If you only believe in the storybook kind, you'll always be disappointed. Watch their faces. What they'd really like to do is take a knife and slit my throat, but they can't, so what they do instead is smile. That's Mrs. Lloyd. Now Mr. Lloyd likes to do it in the kitchen on the linoleum with the lights on. But you won't do that, will you, Mrs. Lloyd? No, real ladies don't do that kind of thing. (ELLE SIGHS) Ah, and that's Mrs. Frank. Mr. Frank likes to be scolded, loves to be spanked. Sit down, darling. Thank you, Henry. Unsettling behavior wouldn't you say, for the president of one of the largest banks in California? Look at them. - (LAUGHING) - They can't take their eyes off you. If I wanted to, in 20 minutes I could have your dance card filled for the whole year. Would you like caviar? Delicious. I feel like I'm in a dream. To dreams. To the ladies that lunch. To the duplicity of their husbands. To courage. To freedom. To money. And to your future. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) The man at the bar, he wants you. Go to him. (WHISPERING) It's time to go to work. Now? Now. Over there. On the chair. Sit back. Put your feet on the stirrups. Do it. (ASSERTIVELY) Do it! (UNZIPPING) (GRUNTING) (ZIPPING) (DOOR CLOSES) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) If you are strong as I think you are, you'll stay. If not, you'll run. I have to know. So do you. Do it. Don't think about it. Just do it. - (DOOR OPENS) - Senator Todd Dixon, Blue. Forgive the formality. (POURING LIQUID) I've just escaped from a terrible sit-down dinner. Not a soul there under 50. (WATER DRIPPING) (DIXON SIGHS) Turn over and lie on your stomach. (WATER TRICKLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) What are you afraid of? Nothing. (MOANING) - (BREATHING HEAVILY) - (THUNDER RUMBLING) You got three weeks. And that's being optimistic. After that, you're hooked. Not to the money or to the sex. But to the power. 'Cause little by little, you become indifferent. You see, most of them, even though they're paying, they want to at least think they're special. And because you don't give a shit, that gives you the power. And when that happens, it's all over. You're hooked. What would you say, Blue, if I told you that in less than 10 years, the United States would be capable of sending men to the moon? I like the moon the way it is. Is that so? I know, it's not gonna happen to you. You're only doing this until you get enough money together to get whatever it is you want. Then you'll just walk away like it never happened. If you really wanna make it work, what you oughta do is to take the money you're spending on me, and buy two plane tickets to Miami beach, sit by the pool, put a little sun tan lotion on her, rent a convertible, take a drive in the Everglades, fuck her in the backseat. Stuff like that. Seriously. - It's true. That's what I told him. - (GIRLS LAUGHING) You can't do that, honey. You keep talking like that, you're gonna put us out of business. Oh, now, that's never gonna happen. There's girls you fuck and girls you marry and never the twain shall meet. Don't you think that every single one of Ellie's girls start out the same way? But the years go by and there they are. - Still dreaming the same bullshit dreams. - (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GIRLS LAUGHING) Three weeks, darling. The meter's ticking. I killed my father, Sully. I broke his heart. You okay? I think so. Take my hand. Scream for me, will you, my dear? Just put your head back, scream. No one will hear you but me. (WOMAN SCREAMING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) Was that so difficult? Somebody pays you to scream, you scream. You open up your goddamn mouth and scream! (DOOR BANGS OPEN) What were you planning to do, darling? Save me again? What you don't seem to understand is there are some people who just don't wanna be saved. (WOMAN SCREAMING) - MAN: Fucking bitch, I'll kick your fucking ass! - (WOMAN SCREAMING) (BOTH SCREAMING) Hey, what's going on here? I was just... Just talking! I was just talking! You wanna talk to someone, you talk to me! All right? - Get out! Get out! - I'm going! - Fuck you! - Get out! Fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! She'll kill me, I know she will! Not if she can't find you. Just come with me. I'll stop the bus. Just get on the bus and come with me. Please. Just come with... Hey, wait! My salvation! - I know you! - (HONKING) Oh! Hi, it's me, Josh, remember, the trumpet player? I can't believe this! What are you doing here? I live here. Thank you, God, thank you! Give me an address or a phone number 'cause I gotta see you. Um. I gotta see you! COLONEL: Joshua! Ah, um... Ah! Look. Meet me tomorrow at the bus station, okay? Four o'clock! Four o'clock, sharp! (HONKING) Hey, baby! Hey, beautiful! Where are you going? Look. Hey, beautiful! Hold up! Hold up! I'm just trying to talk to you! - Please! Why don't you give me a smile? - (MAN LAUGHS) Come here. Touch me. Hold my hand. Where you going? Ah! She's giving us the slip. Go on! (MAN WHOOPS) MAN: Hey! Forget it, baby! You can run but you cannot hide! Come on! A phone number, baby! That's all I'm asking! I gotta be able to find you again! Oh, baby! You're breaking my heart! Baby, baby, baby! You wanna come down for a milk shake? A movie? A drive-in? - Anything! Anything! Please! - (DRIVER CACKLING) - No! - (TIRES SCREECHING) What the hell is this? It's where I live. You wanted to know where to find me. Now you know. - Let's go! - (TIRES SCREECHING) I'm coming back! And I'm gonna buy your ass! You hear me? My name's J.J. Clark! And I'm gonna fuck you, whore! I'm gonna split you apart! Come on! Come on, goon! (MUSIC PLAYING) Aw, shut that music off, Ellie! We didn't drive no goddamned 65 miles that my boy couldn't have his pick of the litter. Come on, girls, let's get your clothes off now. - (MUSIC STOPS) - Let my boy see what he is buying! - Come on! Get your clothes off, ladies. - Excuse me, ladies. Um, as you can see, - my dad, obviously, has my best interest at heart. - Mmm-hmm. But I want you to know the only reason I consented to come out here at all is, uh, I was getting real tired of him calling me queer. - GIRLS: Aw! - So... I want this clearly understood I'm not queer. - I'm just a virgin. - (CHEERING) Not to worry. I come prepared. (CHEERING) My very best and favorite pair of paisley pajamas. A Christmas present from my aunt, Esther. To be worn only on special occasions. I think this qualifies. Hey, cut out your bullshit, boy. Take your pick! (LAUGHING) How long is this supposed to last? 15 minutes? A half hour? An hour? No offense, but, uh, I kind of made up my mind before I came here that I wasn't gonna do anything. I kinda got this notion, see how... How the first time should be with someone that I love. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Sometimes I think my old man knows me better than I know myself. Look at you. If you were just ordinary, I could resist. I know I could. (SCOFFS) Ridiculous pajamas. Christmas present. What are you gonna do? (SIGHS) I really am a virgin. Uh, but I believe in beginner's luck. That boy. If he ever shows up again, I think Mona might be the girl for him. Oh, that's right. Mona's gone. How much money did you give her? Everything I had. Did she tell you she was going to Vegas? She usually does. She'll come back. They always come back. If I wasn't so sure, I'd be angry. Oh, by the way, do you always cry when you make love? (BELL TOLLING) (IT'S LOVE PLAYING) If she didn't tell me, I never would have recognized you. You look good like this. Better even. I told you I was gonna be back. My, uh, buddies over here chipped in to get me a stag party present a little early. (WHOOPING) I'm getting married a month next Sunday! (MEN CHEERING) - Gentlemen, what did I tell you? - Whoo! - What did I fucking tell you? - Yeah! Yes! (CHANTING) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Get the lady a drink. Whatever she wants. - It is on us! - MAN: Whoo! (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) So, tell me about your bride, J.J. She must be some woman to land a man like you. Well, her, uh, daddy owns one of them plastics factories - out on thirty-three. - (MEN LAUGHING) I'm not interested in her daddy, J.J. - MAN: Oh! Okay! - (LAUGHING) Tell me something about her. What color hair does she have? Blonde. Probably, even natural. - Except, you never know for sure, until... - (MAN LAUGHING) Until what, J.J.? Until you can get a chance to match the color of the hair up here with the color down there. MAN: Whoa! (LAUGHING) MEN: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - (LAUGHING) - (WHOOPING) - (MUSIC PLAYING) - Go, have fun! - What about your hair, J.J.? - MEN: Oh! Looks to me like you put on a little lemon on it. (MEN LAUGHING) And sat out on the sun, huh? (CHEERING) Are you a real blonde, J.J.? Let me see. Oh! You're not. (CHEERING) Do you wanna go upstairs? Is that what you want? Let's go. Come on, let's go upstairs. Why go upstairs, J.J., when we can do it right here? If you're gonna rip apart, don't you want your friends to see? After all, they're paying. Get up! What about your plastics queen, J.J.? Are you gonna tell her how ripped me apart? How you made me scream? No problem. You want someone to scream? You scream. You just open up your goddamn mouth and scream! Scream! Scream! Scream! Scream! How does it feel to be a piece of ass for sale? How does it feel to be marrying a plastics queen whose daddy's gonna own your ass for the rest of your life? Come on, J.J.! Come on! Come on! (ALL CHEERING) This is not what I paid for! I don't need a monkey suit to get laid! Come on! Fuck you! Get your hands off me! Get away from me! Come on! Somebody help me out! (BLUE LAUGHS) - Stop it! - I told you never to hit me! Well, you repeat after me! You stop it! "I will never humiliate a client again." - Now you say it! - I hated him! - You hated him? - I hated him! Why? He's nothing! He doesn't exist! - That guy! - I cannot do this anymore, Elle! I can't! I thought I could, but I can't! Well, I've got a lot of time and a lot of money - invested in you, Blue! - I'll pay you back! Yeah? How? With 25 cent tips you'd make waiting on tables? Don't be ridiculous! I can see you now. Hamburger fat with varicose veins running up and down your thighs! Babies sucking on your tits! And a husband who beats the shit out of you when his dinner is late! That's the real life, sweetheart. But lucky for you, you'll never have to live it. - You wanna know why? - Why? Because I won't let you! I won't let you! If she should disappear, I'll hold you responsible. I guess I couldn't stay away. Guess not. You get used to things. I guess so. You. Go put on your best dress. You're coming with me. Give her a break, Tommy. The guy's a goddamned senator. He wants Blue, I deliver Blue. So don't fuck with me! You got it? Do as I say! (THUNDER RUMBLING) EDWARDS: Get in the damn car! Let's go! I need to speak to you. Please. Of course. I don't wanna do this. Don't be frightened. Think of them as extensions of me. Turn around, Blue. Turn around and face me. There's at least $5,000 there. Enough, I'm sure to handle any reservations you might have. Please. Do it, Blue. Let me see your fangs! If you're angry, show me your claws. It's liberating. (WHIRRING) (SCREAMING) No! (WHIMPERS) No! No! No! - (WHIMPERING) Ah! - Undress her. No! No! (WAILING) No! No! (CLICKING) - (CLICKING) - (BLUE SCREAMING) BLUE: No! No! - (BLUE SCREAMING) - (GROANS) Take that shit off her. - Now. - (GUN FIRES) - You wanna try, huh? - (GROANING) Take it off her! How much is this gonna cost me, Sully? What's the deal? You wanna make a deal? You shut your mouth and I don't blow your fucking head off! BLUE: (SOBBING) Get me outta here! SULLY: Come on! Do you have any idea how much trouble you just bought yourself? You wanna talk about trouble, senator? How about the newspapers get a hold of this? Sucker, she's just a fucking whore! (BLUE SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) SULLY: Come on! Get me Edwards! Get me the fucking mayor! (THUNDER RUMBLING) BLUE: (YELLS) No! No, I won't go back there! SULLY: It's okay. - No! No! - It's okay. - No. - It's okay! It's okay! (GRUNTING) I don't wanna make trouble for you, Sully. You're not making any trouble for me, darling. The question is, what do you want to do now? In a perfect world, tell me what you'd want. There's no such thing as a perfect world. Sure there is. Right up here. Everybody has one. Compliments of the senator. Are you crazy? (CHUCKLES) What about Elle? We're talking about you. My daddy and I, we use to have this idea about having the perfect place. A house, school, stuff like that. You wouldn't wanna come with me, would you, Sully? Sort of pretend to be a family? Just for a little while? I'm... I'd be honored. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (ON THE OTHER SIDE PLAYING) (CHEERING) SULLY: How do you like your eggs, darling? I hope you like 'em burned. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) In the play, Shakespeare examines the deterioration of a family. Greed, illusions, broken dreams. King Lear is getting old, so he is going to divide his kingdom among his three daughters. And the one that loves him the best will get the largest share. Ah! Class, this is Blue. Blue McDonald. Well, tell us a little something about yourself, Blue. Well, there really isn't that much to say. And where did you call home before joining us? Sacramento. Ah, Sacramento's a lovely city. Yes. Yes, it is a lovely city. (BELL RINGS) All right, class, we'll discuss the first act tomorrow, so be prepared. It's King Lear, dear. Enjoy it. You might think I'm just a normal high school senior with a football scholarship on his way to West Point, but what I really am is a space traveler from Saturn sent down here to find the perfect woman. (CHUCKLES) You know, when you didn't show up that day in Sacramento, you broke my heart. And now here you are. Is that really your name? Blue? My father liked the color blue. Blue skies, blue moon, like that. Blue McDonald. (CHUCKLES) Perfect. (WHISTLE BLOWING) (SHOUTING) All right now, grab a partner. We're gonna have a little competition. Okay, behind the white line, girls. Wheel barrow race. Wanna be partners? Yeah. On the whistle. (BELL RINGS) Um... Do you wanna be the wheel barrow? Maybe you should. It's the difference between an empty one and a full one. - Okay. - MRS. FELT: All right. Down to the green line. This is stupid. This is high school. MRS. FELT: Ready? (BLOWS WHISTLE) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) We're winning! We're winning! We won! Yes! We won! Oh, my God! My God! We won! I can't believe it. Oh, gosh... (WHISTLE BLOWS) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) This has been one of the best days of school I've ever had. Does your, uh... Your dad let you go out on school nights? No. Weekends? Sure. I think so. Good. Friday night then. No, that's not good enough. Meet me after school tomorrow. I'll ditch practice. There's something I gotta tell you, Sully. This place... It's not just 'cause my father and I drove through here once, it's more than that. There's a boy here. He came by Elle's with his father once. He didn't recognize me. To him I'm just some girl he's seen a couple of times. Well, and that's, uh... All he needs to know. JOSH: I love this place. It used to belong to these two old brothers. They hated each other so much, they didn't talk for 40 years. But they grew the most beautiful flowers and they used to pot 'em here and, uh, sort of sell 'em. Can you imagine that? Living with someone for 40 years and never saying a word. (CHUCKLES) The bed's, uh... (CHUCKLES) The bed's mine. I bought it at an auction and, uh, the sheets and pillow cases are my mom's. I sort of borrowed them. Whenever I run away from home, this is where I come. As long as we're here, you don't mind if I air out the sheets, do you? You read On The Road? It's like Kerouac jumped right inside my head. Driving fast back and forth across the country. One adventure after another. Free thinking, free falling. My dad's got this... This idea how the Point is gonna straighten me out. Brain wash me maybe. (CHUCKLES) Straighten me out. Never. My God, you're pretty. Seriously pretty. Squint my eyes just right and I can almost see through that dress. (CHUCKLES) Just kidding. You probably got a boyfriend somewhere who's gonna come here and kick my ass, but I don't care. I don't have a boyfriend. You do now. You probably think I bring every girl I meet here, but I don't. It might sound crazy, but I've always had the idea that the first time should be with someone special. How I'd wait until I found someone I loved. And did you? What? Wait. Kind of. I don't know, there was this kind of Oriental girl. I never heard her speak. - And... - Did you make love to her? Almost. Almost. Wait. Did I say something wrong? Did I do something wrong? Did I? Wait. Wait. Did you ever see anybody walk on their hands? I can go all the way to Pittsburg like this. Watch. (WHISPERING) WOMAN: Blue? Blue McDonald? There's a phone call for you in the Principal's office. It's your mother. Hello? Hello? If you'd known it was me, would you have come to the phone? What the hell are you doing? Getting out of here. She knows where we are. It's over. She knows exactly where we are. She called me at school. At school! Where are you gonna go? Somewhere, anywhere, I don't care. You don't care. And what are you gonna do when she finds you? Run? And run again? And run again? You gotta stand up to her. She senses any weakness, she moves in for the kill. My mother! She told them she was my mother! (CHEERLEADERS CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERING) Blue. Twenty-four. Sweep. On hut. ALL: Ready! Tigers! (CHEERING) (PLAYERS GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (SOBBING) - Time out. Time out. Time out. - (WHISTLE BLOWS) GAME ANNOUNCER: This is it! The last play of the game. The California division's two championship come down to this. Boy, let me tell you something, you're not gonna embarass me. (CHEERING) This is for the state championship, goddammit! Now just get your ass back in there and win this game. Huh? Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! (CROWD CHEERING) (SHOUTS) Down! Set! Hike! (PLAYERS GRUNTING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (CROWD BOOING) I'm a fake! Everything about me is bullshit. I'm a fake, too. (SNIFFLES) (WHISPERS) I love you. I know you do. COLONEL: Josh? Come on out. Hell, it's important. There's some scouts that saw you tonight. They saw you play and they want to talk to you. Hell, you never know, you might change your mind about going to the Point. You know what your old man says. It's always a good idea to have a back up. Come on, Josh. Come on, Son. Wait for me. COLONEL: Sit down, Son. I think this is just about the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life, Son. But you would have heard about it sooner or later. And it's better you hear it from somebody that loves you. Now, I wouldn't have believed this if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. I know how hard this is for you, Son. Turn it off. Please, turn it off. Let it run. Let the fucking thing run. Who are you to judge me? Who are any of you to judge me? Do you finally recognize me? Do you? The girl you just couldn't resist? (SHOUTS) What? You always got so much to say. Say it! (SONS AND DAUGHTERS PLAYING) Aren't you even going to ask me why? I understand. I know you wanted it to be different. You hope and pray it'll be different, but it never is. They hate people like us. Hate us because we tell the truth. Because we live it. Son of a bitch! Run the motherfucker down, Tommy! - Jesus! - Run him down! Bastard! Goddammit, Sully! Tommy! ELLE: Sully... SULLY: Are you nuts? Are you fucking nuts? (BLUE SOBBING) She's made up her mind. She's coming with me! You wanna live or do you wanna die? You go with her, it's the same as dying. Let me make it real fucking easy for you. I lived in the sewer all my life and I can't stand seeing one more person I love drown in it! Who in the hell are you to judge anybody? Do you wanna live or you wanna die? You say it! Say it, goddammit! (BLUE SOBBING) She can't do it, Elle. Don't make it about winning. Just let her go. ELLE: You'll come back. I can wait. (ENGINE STARTS) Sully, you awake? What do you think? You wanna hear the good news? Are you kidding? At least I don't have to worry about him finding out anymore. The cat's out of the bag. What do you think he'd say if I showed up at school on Monday morning, my homework done, my book report finished. What the hell, right? (SIGHS) Coming from Saturn I... I sometimes get confused with Earth people, their customs and... So what I usually try to do in the really tough situations is to let my heart do my thinking for me. Heart my ass! Talk is cheap when you've never had to worry about how to get out of the goddammed rain. (YELLS) Let me tell you something. You are really starting to piss me off. Just put yourself in my shoes, okay? It's kind of hard to adjust, see, when all of a sudden you find out the girl you love was a prostitute. So it kinda disoriented me for a second, okay? So I... It took me 10 minutes to adjust, all right? What am I supposed to do? Punish myself for the rest of my life? I loved you the first time I saw you. I loved you the second time I saw you, even though I didn't know it was you. I loved you at the farm and I loved you under the bleachers and... (SIGHS) And I love you now. Please. You know it's possible you could be my salvation. (LAUGHS) You know I think I like "I love you" better. (LAUGHS) (ON THE OTHER SIDE PLAYING)
