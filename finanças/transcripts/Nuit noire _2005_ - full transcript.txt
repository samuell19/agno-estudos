Child, I was afraid to sleep, the night seemed so peopled with ghosts. My fear and my desire to see them caused events which I recognized very well without really understanding them. BLACK NlGHT Come on. Make an effort. If you don't help me, we'll get nowhere. Squeeze your fist harder. Squeeze harder. That's enough. That'll do for today. You're wrong to be so stubborn. You're making things up. Your sister is not dead. It's even likely that you never had a sister. So you're not guilty of anything. When will you understand that? Come back next Thursday. And try to find something else. It's 9:00. The management offers you a musical interlude. It's 12:00 and 23 seconds. In one minute, it will be daylight for 15 seconds. It's 5:00. The management of the museum wishes you a pleasant evening. And you must close the front door. Today, there was a woman lurking in the corridor. But what are you doing in my place? You have no right to be here. I don't understand what you're saying. Madame Grubach saw you. I don't want any trouble. Madame Grubach is on the stairs. You can't leave now. Tomorrow morning, she'll be out. You can leave then. Wake up! Kamelou? At the museum? I'm going to try to see him. I'll be back. Stay calm. I must give you this. I don't want to do that. I don't know what to do. She came to my place. Tell her to come back here. She is sick. You can do nothing for her. But you can take care of her? No, she can't be cured. She knows that very well. She must come back here. And then she won't bother you anymore. Listen, you are very ill. Tomorrow, I'll try to find some medicine. I know someone who will help us. But you mustn't make any noise. What's her name? Tell me her name. Marie Neige. Marie Neige... that's very pretty. I'd have liked to be called that. Why did you come here? Oh! The director's son. We are honored by your visit. I need medicine. - What kind? - I don't know... Trycline, Sogenol. Ah... You are pregnant? I'm not joking. Watch out, old chap, you're playing with fire. Do you remember that business with Fred? Go back to your office and forget this medicine nonsense. It'll be better for everyone. Don't touch! It's fragile. It's not for little boys. It's poetry time already. This time, I got him! I got him, that bastard! Come and see. It's the guy who attacked the little girls. What filth! Do you want to shoot? Wait! Take the gun! Don't be afraid. This time I got him. It's the guy who attacked the little girls. She came looking for me. You have to tell me you love me. Hurry up! There's hardly any time. Don't look at her! Don't leave me alone. It's impossible... I could never do that without certificates. And how would we bring her here? In your suitcase? You'll find a way. Call the cleaning service. They'll get rid of her for you. If they askyou anything, act stupid. You should always act stupid. You'll do that very well! They won't believe me. Of course they'll believe you. You're the darling. You've nothing to fear. Look how pretty it is. Stroke it. This brings luck in love. You're going to need it. At last. About time. We're there. There's a problem with your films. I don't understand it. It's not clear at all. It's grainy-- much too grainy! I have something for you... Filmed by your father. You won't tell anyone it was me who gave it to you, right? Careful. It's dynamite. The light's screwed everything up. No more pictures, no more film. No cinema! No grain-- nothing left! Niks meer! De flesh is af! This way, Mademoiselle. You are very pretty. Are you interested in taxidermy? Come. Be my guest. The light is dangerous. I've set up a screen. Come here. I'll show you. Don't be afraid. Nobody comes here. The Sans-soucis bar. A very popular place. They only serve absinthe. Look. Look how perfect it is. All they lack is speech. Look at the eyes... the nobility of posture... It's very rare, you know. Sometimes you hear them laugh or groan. Impossible to tell if it's suffering... or pleasure. You'll take a little drink, right? Ah! And now we need music. Your health, Mademoiselle. To yours...
