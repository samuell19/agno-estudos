I'm arriving, I hope I'll manage to find the address easily. I can't wait to be with you. See you soon. Bye. Mara? Mara? Mara? Where are you? Ah, here you are! - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - Good morning. I represent the lawyer Del Tori. - The lawyer from Palermo, I presume. - Yes, is mrs Tarasco in? Silvia Sarti, now she's my wife! - I have important news to comunicate to her. - My wife doesn't feel well. Can you tell me? - Sorry, I can't. I repeat that my wife is not well, because of her father's assassination. That's why I'm here, the lawyer has deposited the testament. I'm at your disposal, what's this about? About your father, madam. My relations with him were not good, I didn't know if he would want me at his funeral, so I didn't go. - I understand. - I also know that he left me only the legitimate. He told me so, some time ago. So you already know that you cannot lay claim to anything else, from your father's property. All his belongings will be offered, as of his will, to humanitarian organizations. Here, this is the authenticated notification. of the testamentary executor. It's absurd that this man went that far. Silvia is his only child and we will impugn this testament. As you wish, the heritage has been confiscated. The magistrate is investigating his presumed ties to the Mafia. - But my wife's rights... - Forget it, I won't object. That's all, madam. Still, I have to advise you not to return to Italy, for the time being. The police suspects that the motives for your father's... assassination, are tied to illegal activities. Exposing yourself could be very dangerous. My respects. I knew it. Crumbs! That filthy bastard has only left you crumbs! Marco and I were tourist guides, this was the only diversion of a sadder and sadder existence. After my father's death I felt alone He had tried to prevent me from marying Marco. Marco had become more and more violent. I hated him, I wanted to escape, but i didn't know how. Through a game of destiny, I would meet Denise and her story was very similar to mine. We'll meet at the medina, I'm going at Hassan's bazar. Who were you talking to? Where are you going? Who's gonna fuck you today? Eh? - Leave me! - No! - Leave me! - You are mine! You are only mine, understood? Leave me! Leave me! Now you'll do as I say! You like it, eh? I've spoiled you... - Untranslated subtitle - Denise! Denise, open! Don't be stupid! Hello? - Hi, it's me. She's going at Hassan's bazar... Make her pay! - Untranslated subtitle - No... No! - Come here! - No! - Come here! Leave me! Now we're gonna have some fun! - No! - Is it far? - We'll be there in 10 mins. I can't wait to dive in the water. This is one of the hotest summers of the past years. What do you know, this is just the second summer that we pass here. From what I remember, it's been a long time since we had such a hot summer. If you say so, Fatima. You are the only one that knows. But what's happening? Marco, they're attacking that woman, we must help her! Stop! Stop! Hurry, they're escaping! Stop you bastards! Stop! What happened? They attacked me, then they saw you and left. How do you feel? Now I'm fine, thanks. Please, can I come with you, I'm afraid to be left alone. Sorry, but we're accompanying the tourists to the hotel... - She'll take a taxi from there. - Thanks. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes, she told you already! A bit irritable, is he your fiance? - No, my husband. - Ah! They left you a mark. Yes, but this isn't from those thugs. this is another story. I'm also married. My husband and I are living a few miles outside Tunisia, we run a small pension, just four rooms. If you need anything, this is the address. Here. We've arrived. Please get off. - Goodbye. Thanks. Bye. I can't wait to take a shower. I can't thank you enough, if it weren't for you... Thanks. - Yes, yes... - Don't be a stranger Silvia. - Sure. I sensed Denise close to me, my subconscious was pushing me to accept her protection. I was attracted by her personality, her way of behaving. I would like to become her friend. No, I don't like her! She comes off as snobbish. She seems nice to me. She's gentle and protective. Poor woman, those two gave her a rough time, eh? I bet that it was her that provoked them. She probably flirted with them, but it all ended badly and they stole her jeep. They're giving you strange looks. They don't approve of an arabian woman who dresses in european style. If you have something to do go ahead. Now I can orientate myself easily. Marco wouldn't like you going about all alone. Don't take too seriously what he says. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - What did she say? - Never mind, let's go. - What does "mousiba" mean? Registered post, sign here. Thanks, goodbye. - Thank you. From Switzerland? Finally. Hi Marco. What's new? What do you mean? Nothing's ever new here. Do you know by any chance, what does "mousiba" mean? Why do you want to know? I just heard it from a woman at the suk. It's not a good thing, it has a sinister significance. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - I was beginning to hate this country and its painful way of dealing with time. But when I first got here, I fell in love with it, fascinated by its mysterious sounds, its intense odours, its breathtaking sunsets... I was living suspended between reality and dream. But... dreams, often become nightmares, like Marco's violent behaviour. I tried to contact Denise, but she didn't reply at the telephone. I was feeling really alone. Something was gripping my throat and I was feeling weaker and weaker. Let me through, someone call a doctor. Doctor, a girl has fainted. Let me through! I'm a doctor! Give her space. Bring her some water and sugar, go! Silvia! What's happened to her? Nothing serious, just low blood pressure. With this heat she must have lost metalic salts. Has it happened again? - No, it's low blood pressure, I don't drink enough water and eat very little. - Are you here on vacation? No, I live here for two years with my husband. I'm sorry, I haven't presented myself my name is Dario. I'm Silvia. Thanks for your help. It's my duty... I'm a doctor. Thanks for everything doctor. Come on, let's go. - Are you feeling better? - Yes, much better, thanks. Did you enjoy the doctor's treatment? I saw how you were looking at him. - You're an idiot! What? What did you say? Don't you dare to talk to me in that manner! Why so? It's you who shouldn't treat me like shit! I'm tired, got it? I just can't take anymore of that arrogance of yours! Enough! Only I will tell when it's enough. It's me who's tired, do you understand? - You're crazy. I'm crazy? You diserve a lesson! Leave me. I beg you Marco, Leave me! Let's go! - You're hurting me. - Move it, walk I said! Please... - Untranslated subtitle - Let's see if tomorrow you'll still be in the mood for hysterics. Marco, I beg you, don't leave me here. Help! - Untranslated subtitle - - Hello. - Hi, I've arrived. Good, it pleases me to see that you're punctual. - Did you receive the letter? - Certainly. I'd like to see you right away, tomorrow I have to return. Ok, we're as much in a hurry as you are. We'll meet in a couple of hours at my hotel. Ok, no problem. - Better not discuss it anymore over the phone. - I'll see you soon, then. - See you soon. - Ok. Help me, open the door! - Help! Let me out! Help! Fatima, open the door. - Silvia. Keep calm, I'll open it. How did you end up in here? Ask that madman, Marco. If you need anything, this is the address. Here. Don't be a stranger. This time I swear I'm gonna denounce him. It won't do nothing, here it's not Europe and a man is always right. Even me that I'm half French I have to deal with it every day. -Silvia, where are you going? - I'm not telling you. Think it over, don't do anything stupid! I'm, sorry Marco, I... - Doesn't matter, but leave us alone now. See you later. Morning darling, did you sleep well? Where are you going? Wherever I want. And don't try to stop me. Don't. The thought hasn't crossed my mind. I bet that by 10 this evening you'll be back. I wouldn't be so sure this time. I was afraid that I wouldn't find the courage to escape, but I did. I had come out of a nightmare and didn't dare to even think about the consequences, but I was hoping that Denise, would welcome me. She was the only person that could help me. Even if I didn't know her well, I felt I could trust her, I hadn't heard from her, since we first met, but I knew that I would find her. Excuse me, I'm looking for Denise, do you know where I can find her? - Depends, who are you? - A friend of hers. Here, this address, she gave it to me. - I'm Kurt, the husband. - Pleased to meet you, I'm Silvia. - Silvia! - I'm glad to see you! - What a surprise! How are you? - Fine, thanks. I hope I'm not disturbing you. - I didn't expect you so soon, but I'm glad you decided to leave him. - How did you know? - The suitcase. Seems you decided to end it once and for all. Yes, I finally decided it. You can stay here, for as long as you like, we're vacant. It's the off season, there's only a japanese couple, but they're leaving tomorrow. You can put your car in the garage. - You got your jeep back. - Yeah, I was lucky. Those thugs abbandoned it. I'll show you your room, come. Ok. I'm going to bed, tomorrow I have to be up at dawn. Goodnight. I'm also very tired, see you tomorrow. Our room is next to yours, if you need anything, let me know. There's a bottle of water on the bedside table. - Thanks. - What for, it's a pleasure to have you here. She's cute, your friend. Perhaps she's feeling a little lonely. I advise you to leave her alone. Or else? Just leave her alone! Don't touch me! - Come on, stay still. - I told you not to touch me! - Don't object, just do what I want. - Leave me! - Leave me! - Come on, I want to have sex. - Leave me alone you coward! - Come on, I know you want it too. No, I don't. Leave me alone, no! - When did you meet him? - Three years ago, at Viareggio. It was the first time I was vacationing by myself. But I fell for him immediately and he fell for me. Love at first sight. Yes... In the beginning, Marco was very sweet. and I couldn't understand why my father was so hostile towards him. He was convinced that Marco was after my money, that is, his money, you know how it is... And then? Then we went away, we got married, we came to stay here and my father never forgave me. And what went wrong? I don't know, suddenly Marco changed. He became someone else, completely different from the man he was before. You should have listened to your father. I was never capable of making the right choice. Though this time I hope that I did. Do you regret your decision? No, I don't think so. Surprised? What do you want? Can't you guess? You'd better leave, Silvia doesn't intend to come back to you. Mind your own business, I want to hear it from her. Lost your breath? Don't ever touch me again, is that clear? What's going on? Is there a problem? - I'm not looking for trouble. I just want my wife to return home with me. Ah... And do you want to return? No. It seems to me that this discussion has ended. If you think that... Did you have enough... or you want me to continue? It's enough. But I'm not finished with you. - Untranslated subtitle - - Ah, it's you. - What happened to you? - I stepped on a banana peel and fell. - Tell the truth. - Forget it. What do you want? - There are some Italians that want an excursion in the desert, tomorrow. No. And tell to the guys at the agency to not count on me for a while. - Mustafa will not be happy. - Who cares? You look beautiful, you know? I've taken some fantastic pictures of you. - Please. One of these days we should go boating you and I. Forget it! - - Don't lie to me, I know you only too well. You've acted like a scumbag, as usual. I'm warning you, don't try to lay a finger on her, otherwise... What? Look who's talking, as if your behaviour is exemplary. Did Silvia complain to you? Hello. Just a moment. Silvia. It's for you. - Who is it? Fatima. - Yes. - You must return home immediately. - What happened? - Marco is very sick. I don't know what to do, we must get him to the hospital. - I don't know, Fatima. - Please come, he's in a bad shape. He has a high fever, Silvia come back, he needs to be taken care of. I'll think about it. I'm sure she'll come. Silvia! Wait for me! Did you thing that I'd let you go alone? - Thanks, you're a friend. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Better wait here. - Ok, but if you need me, call me, ok? Ok. Welcome home Silvia. It's hot, do you want something to drink? -Weren't you sick? - Now I'm feeling better. You son of a bitch. My mother wouldn't be pleased to hear you say that. A well educated girl like you, shouldn't use those words. You wouldn't want to go so soon, now? - Let me pass. You know, darling, you came here too late. - I'm not alone. - I know, you came with your new friend. But you won't get out of here. - Stop it, you're hurting me. I'll hurt you more if you don't do as I say. - Untranslated subtitle - - so? Now I'm gonna change your mind. -< Don't touch me! Where do you think you're going? - Untranslated subtitle - I'll denounce you. Here if a wife abandons her husband, gets into serious trouble! And tell to that whore to return to her house. You stay here with me! You'd like to go with your friend? I'm fed up with your whims. I can't take anymore! Tell that idiot to leave! I just can't take anymore! Hold it! Now that's enough. Now you'll stay here and Silvia comes with me, is that clear? Let's go. - Why are you leaving? Come here, I'll take care of you, too. Drop the gun bitch! -Nooo! - Did you kill him? - I didn't mean to. He... attacked me. My God, what did you do? We must get rid of the corpse. You're crazy, I'm calling the police. Try to reason! It's true it was an accident, but how can we prove it? -One way or another they'll find out. - Not if you do as I say. Why did you bring a gun? I took it from Kurt, I just wanted to scare him. You killed him, do you understand? He attacked me and I pressed the trigger. But you must believe me, I've never even held a gun before. - Please, let's call the police. - No, don't even think about it. I don't want to end my days in a Tunisian prison cell. A friend of mine got 8 years just for some weed and she never got out of that prison. She committed suicide in there. And what are we supposed to do? Let's use our brains. No one saw us, so... -Someone's at the door. -Keep your cool. It's Fatima. Get rid of her and don't let her in. -Try to act natural. - I can't do it. You must! - Hi Silvia. - Hi. I came to see how Marco's doing. Marvo left. He left? He had to return immediately to Italy, his sickness was just an excuse. He wanted me to go with him, but I didn't feel like it. Are you sure he left? Certainly, but he'll be back soon. Do you need anything? Nothing, thanks. I don't know. We must make the body disappear. - Untranslated subtitle - Come on! We're almost there. Denise, let's call the police, while we still can. Stop it! But why? It was just an accident. Noone ever comes here. They'll never find him. God, I think I'll faint. If you can't make it, go back to the car. I can do it by myself. Done! -You sure you can drive? - Yes. What did you want to tell me so urgently? I have work to do. I have to ask you for a favor uncle Omar, no big thing for you. That's what you say, it depends on the favor. Remember that I'm just a police inspector and if you're trying to get a friend out of jail, forget about it. No, it's about Marco, the Italian guy I'm working with. So? He went away and left behind a shitload of debts? No, his wife told me that he returned to Italy, but I don't believe her, he wouldn't leave without telling me. You know I always thought he could not be trusted and I never liked the wife either. But if it's only that, I'll ask for a control at the customs office. It's seven o'clock. The Ramadan is finished. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - You too are having trouble sleeping? I've brought you those, they'll help you to get some rest. Go on, take them. They'll do you good. Denise, I beg you, help me, tell me that it was just a nightmare. What is it? You can't sleep? God, you startled me. Where were you today? Well? Will you respond to my question? I went shopping. You were with one of your usual lovers, weren't you? And what if I was? If I find out, I'll kill you. You're hurting me. I know... Hi. So, did you manage to get some rest? Very little. Judging by the way she looks I'd say she's not well. Listen, you can't stay here all the time you must get out to get some fresh air. I don't want to. I know how you feel, but you must try. You have to go on living as if nothing had happened. because sooner or later, someone will come to ask about Marco and we can't allow any suspisions to arise, can we? You're right. Was it Kurt? Did he give you that bruise? Yes, I can't take anymore, I wish he ended up like Marco. - You mustn't say that. - Believe me, I can't take anymore. Why don't you just leave him? He wouldn't allow it. You can always escape. He would find me. And he'd make me pay for it. And why did you marry him? Because he was good in bed. I have had many men, but he had something more, which later became something too much. At that point he was already my husband. I'm going for another dive, you order a drink. Denise! What? What happened? - I saw Marco. What are you saying? Have you gone mad? I swear, he was sitting in that chair. It's not possible, come with me. Come on. - Untranslated subtitle - Did you hear? Nobody was sitting here. Silvia, you just need some rest. I asked about your friend he never left Tunisia, but he hasn't commited any crimes there's no record. I knew Silvia lied. Now I must find out why. Please don't get mixed up in this, it's none of your business. Don't get in trouble. Don't worry uncle. Why are you always so stubborn? And you keep wearing these improper clothes. But uncle, in the west all women dress like that. Look at them, they're obscene, shameless! Here is not the west. Trust me, it's a great place, it's what you need. I come here often, you'll see that you'll like it. It will help you to relax. - Do you think so? -Yes. - You are so kind to me. Without you, I don't know how I'd manage. I feel so good in your company. Come, let's enter. This is the oldest hamam in Tunisia. I've never been at a turkish bath before. It's a strange place. And also exciting, don't you think? Experiences are the salt of life. - Untranslated subtitle - I've had very few experiences. I was brought up in a glass cage isolated from everything and everyone. My mother was overprotective with me. The only moment of escape was when we were taking pictures. She was very good at it. I remember when we took the picture that's hanging on my bedroom wall. We were happy. - But she never let you free. No... Not even when I studied in Milan. I was jealous of my friends who were going out at night with their boyfriends. I'm going to lie for a while. I'll leave you to your massage. - Untranslated subtitle - Wake up Silvia. Silvia! Wake up. It's nothing serious. Don't worry, calm down, everything's all right. It's too hot in here and she passed off. It wasn't a good idea spending the afternoon at the hamam. It was me who insisted, I'm sorry. Take a deep breath. Have you ever had heart problems? Yes, when I was little but since then I've been ok. As I imagined. I'd like to make a more thorough check, but I'm certain it's nothing serious. You rest, and we'll see each other in a couple of days. It was fortunate that I found you, thanks for everything. Come by at my place, you know where I live, no? Please, don't tire yourself. I'll see you. I told you, it was Marco, he tried to kill me. Silvia, I'm starting to worry, Marco is dead. Either you deal with it, or you'll risk losing your mind. You were there, we dumped his body in the swamp. How could he still be alive? But I saw him, understand? I saw him! He tried to strangle me. - That's enough Silvia! You can't go on like this, it's all in your imagination, you're still upset. You have to trust me, otherwise I'll lose my mind too. You're right, I'm sorry, but... I can't take it anymore. Please help me Denise. Silvia relax... I'm here for you. Don't be afraid. But I don't want to hear anymore about Marco. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Thanks for everything. - Bye, I'll see you. See you. - Goodbye. It's late, I'll go at the embassy, my passport is about to expire. -Can I come with you? - No. I don't know how long it'll take and for you today is too hot. Where's Kurt? There he is... Always ready to get into a fight. I wouldn't be surprised if one day he ended up with a knife in his belly. Is that a worry, or a hope? You know perfectly well what's my reply. -Hi Silvia. -Fatima. How come you're in these parts? I came to see my uncle. He lives here. He's the inspector. -I'm happy to see you. - Marco didn't return to Italy. What? He never left, my uncle told me. Why did you lie to me? I just told you what he told me, if later he changed his mind, I don't know. And you don't know where he is now? I don't have the faintest idea. That's what I have to find out. Fatima was beginning to suspect I was afraid that sooner or later she would find out the truth. I don't know. I'm calling her for over an hour, her cell phone must be off. Have you had lunch? - No, I'll have some fruit later. Let's go to the sea, what do you say? Sorry, I don't feel like it, I'm tired. Yes? -Silvia, it's me. Denise, where are you? I'm stuck at the embassy, for the passport. As soon as they give it to me I'm coming home. Tell Kurt. -You'll be late? - I don't know. Don't call me on my cell phone, the batteries are low. Ok? Bye. It was Denise. She's at the embassy, she doesn't know when she'll be back. One of her usual excuses. But now I've had enough. This time she'll pay. See you tomorrow. I'm going to bed. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - Help! Help! Hi Silvia. You can't escape this time. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - Silvia! Silvia! What happened to you? How do you feel? -Denise, it was terrible. -What was? I was right, Marco is alive, he tried to kill me and I shot him. And where was Kurt when all that was happening? I don't know, I was in my bedroom sleeping. So you were asleep and then you heard that music? Yes. Before going to bed yesterday did you take the sleeping pills? Yes, what's that gotta do with anything? That explains everything, it was a nightmare. Just another bad dream. I wish it was a nightmare. I swear it was him, he's at the beach. Look, there he is! Kurt! Silvia... this is not Marco. It's Kurt! I paid too much for this, to just leave it to Kurt. We must split. I'm going to the city, when I get back I'll report his disappearence. In the meanwhile try to get some rest. - I'll try. Silvia Sarti you said? Strange, I think I know you. I've already heard your name. Fatima works with your husband, right? -Yes. Here inspector, this is the picture of my husband. Good... If in the meantime he reappears, let me know immediately. - Sure. Good day. - See? Everything goes well. Not really, the inspector is Fatima's uncle. And so? There's one important thing that I forgot to tell you. Fatima knows that Marco did not go back to Italy. and wants to know where he is. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - Here... good day. - Untranslated subtitle - Marco! Excuse me. -Did you find my uncle, it's urgent! - He'll be here in an hour. - Untranslated subtitle - I've already booked a ticket on the flight for Italy. I'm sorry I have to leave you at such a bad moment, but I can't deal with it anymore. -And where will you go? -As far as possible from all this. I'd like to come with you, but I can't, the inspector would suspect me but as soon as I sell the "riad", I'll come to find you. -Promise? -Sure. I need some time to take care of things. I'll pass from home to get my passport. I'll call you later, I'll accompany you to the airport. You can cover her up. I'm sorry Omar, there was nothing we could do. She was coming to meet me. The car's wheels have crashed her torso. She was dead when they brought her at the hospital. - Untranslated subtitle - -Hello? -Have you arrived? Yes, now I'm getting my passport and I'll come, ok? -Hurry up. I'll wait. -Bye. Damn... Where is it? Where did I put it? -Here it is. - Yes? Hi Silvia, you'll pay dearly for what you've done. - Untranslated subtitle - Silvia! Wake up, what happened? - Wake up Silvia! Come on dear. Stay calm, it's me. The passport... Tell me, what happened? The passport was there. and there was a bloodied knife Now calm down, it was just another nightmare. You're not well. You're having a panic attack. The passport, I found it... I put it in that chair. - You only think you did it. Now we'll accompany you to the riad, we'll find the passport, ok? It's not the time. -That poster... - What about it? -Nothing, nothing... - It's all right Silvia. -How come you're here, too? -Denise called me, You weren't responding on the telephone and we came here, the door was wide open. The door wasn't open, it was locked from the outside. Noone wants to hurt you, it's all in your imagination. Why are you so worried about me? If I told you that I just think you're nice, I would be lying. Come on, let's go to the car. Now try to relax and don't think about it. Denise didn't want me to leave I had the impression that she wanted to keep me from going away. There was something strange in her behaviour, but I could just as well be immagining things, once again. Denise! Denise, where are you? Denise? Denise? Denise, are you in the room? The dynamic of the incident doesn't exclude the possibility that it was premeditaded. Poor girl... So happy, so carefree... I loved her. Do you know Silvia Sarti? I've seen her a couple of times. And what do you think of her? Why are you asking? In the last days, Fatima, was perplexed by the sudden departure of her husband. Do you know anything about that? Not much... I've seen him just once and he didn't seem like a nice guy to me. Why, are you seeing a connection with Fatima's death? I don't know... Probably... it's just a hunch. But when you're desperate, you'll hold on to even the slightest lead, in order to arrive at the truth. - Untranslated subtitle - What? Ah... I see. Ok, I'm coming. They've found a corpse in the swamps, it's a man. Let's go... I'm coming with you. He attacked me. I'll take care of you, too. Drop the gun bitch! But believe me, I've never even held a gun before. Hi Silvia, you'll pay dearly for what you've done. Did you really think that you killed me? You're so stupid. You'll never be able to get rid of me. Yes, it's Kurt, Denise's husband. I think he's been dead for a while. Probably since the night that he disappeared. Yes, we found him. Yes, yes, they murdered him. No, I'll inform the wife, so that I can ask her some questions I understand that you're not of the profession, but you must have seen some police movies and you'll know that you mustn't touch anything in the scene of a crime. Give me the passport that you hid in your pocket. Silivia Tarascio... A beautiful girl... but distracted. Let's go. How did he die? They shot him twice in the chest, I'm sorry. Do you have any idea on who could have done it? Maybe. You have an alibi, at the embassy they confermed you where there. But I'd like to talk to your friend Silvia, is she in? No, she's not, but why do you want to talk to her? Your friend was the last person to see your husband alive. -Before the killer, you mean. - It's possible, but we mustn't exclude... the possibility that she really was the last person. We found her passport next to the corpse, so... she's our number one suspect. I told the guard I was your friend, and he let me in. I... must talk to you. Me too. They found Kurt's corpse and next to it, your passport covered in blood. Can you explain it? You killed him. Yes. It was me. A day as hot as this... and the fan doesn't work. Don't worry inspector, in 5 minutes It'll be as good as new. Yes... as good as new. Hi Silvia, you'll pay dearly for what you've done. Did you really think that you killed me? You're so stupid. You'll never be able to get rid of me. -Do you think it's a frame up? - Yes, beyond any doubt. But... I really don't understand anyhing anymore. This story is so absurd. - I'm certain that he's alive. My passport, somebody placed it next to the corpse. They're trying to frame me. - But it doesn't make any sense. Even Denise has a lot to lose. And then you said that it was her who shot Marco. - Yes. She also swore that she had never even held a gun before. But she knew how to use it. You told me that the tranquilizers that you use were given to you by Denise. Yes. And I admit I used them frivolously. These aren't tranquilizers. Someone has replaced them with something else. And I wouldn't be surprised if they turned out to be hallucinogenics. And that would explain my visions? -Certainly. Right. Now you stay here like a good girl and you wait for me to return. Ehm... Does Denise know you're here? No, but where are you going? I'm going to try and figure out what's really going on. Silvia Tarscio. We already arrested her. She confessed everything. It was her that killed your husband, madam. Like we say in poker, I've pulled a bluff, now I'll just wait and see who'll buy it. Then I'll explain it to you. Soon we'll forget about her, I've authorised my lawyer to sell the riad, we can leave this evening. Did you bring the gun? When they find the gun in her room, they'll have to imprison her. As you see, everything goes as planned. To Dario, in rememberance of that day of September, Denise. I didn't have to do much to deceit Silvia's father You're fantastic, I was lucky to have met you when you were working at the bank in Lugano. Without you, I wouldn't have discovered the secrets of a bank, and the coded account he had left her By disinheriting her, he protected her from Mafia's vengeance who were after his money, but could not find out about the Swiss account. Her father did not hate her, he did what he did in order to protect her, and part of the money. Making her fall in love with you was very easy she's so ingenuous... And then you managed to become co-holder of the account. Corrupting the bank director was a piece of cake. A generous bribe and my charms have been more than enough. MIR 128 VZ... I'm gonna enjoy spending all that money. You mean we're gonna enjoy. Careful, I may have acquired a taste for killing men. -You'd even kill me? - Don't tempt me. And what if Silvia told the police that I killed you? When they see that I'm alive they'll think she's crazy. She could always say that you helped her to hide Kurt's body. And I'll deny it. The truth is too absurd to be credible. She'll end her days in prison... while you and I will be enjoying her poor father's 10 million. Our plan was perfect. Nothing and noone can stop us. Bastards! I'll kill you and then I'll tell everything to the police. You're sick, you're crazy! They'll never believe you! It's over, Silvia. It's not loaded. Everything's against her, she's the number one suspect. But she's also psychologicaly fragile, with all she's been through, she'll collapse, she wouldn't be able to last not even a day in prison. Omar, she'll go crazy! It's not true that I arrested her, I just wanted to see how you would react. Why, you thought I had something to do with all that? You can never be too prudent and experience has taught me that you should always doubt everyone. And this is the proof that might be able to acquit her of the charge. And I know how that diabolical scheme was organized. Me too, but we must wait a while longer... I want to catch them in the act. Come on, get in! Did you make her swallow the pills? - Sure. The gas will take care of the rest. Let's wait here and see what happens. Go on, follow them! But the driver is Marco, Silvia's husband. Let's go, quickly! -Shit, the police! -We'll berth at Monastir. - Will we make it on time for the plane? We must! Start the engine, I'll release the moorings! You damned bastards! -Stop it! We know everything! -Go! You can't escape! - Untranslated subtitle - Nooo! You took a risk, he almost got you. Allah protected me, I had to avenge Fatima. Noo! No, Marco... Why? Where is Silvia? -She killed herself. -Go on, talk! Where is she? For you it's finished. So you'd better tell us where Silvia is. And you'd better tell us now! In the garage, at the riad. Quickly, let's go! Silvia! Silvia! She's still alive, call an ambulance! Hello, we need an ambulance, please hurry. I was finaly out of that devilish labyrinth. I wanted to start living again. Dario was with me. I had my doubts even for him, but I'm glad I was wrong. Now, I want to leave everything behind me and start trusting life again. Don't worry, you won't miss that flight. I'm curious about something, that book with Denise's dedication on it, in your office. I used to date her, but I came to the conclusion that she wasn't the right woman for me. And who would be the right woman for you? I could explain it to you during the flight, if you take me with you. -The airplane is filled to capacity. -Yes, but... I already bought a ticket. By the way, how is your financial situation?
