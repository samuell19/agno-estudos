(dramatic orchestral music) - [Narrator] Earth was once a beautiful blue planet. That was a long time ago. After endless wars and brutal violence, the wealthiest citizens left Earth and created a civilization on the moon. Back on Earth, life was a constant fight for survival. Governments were overthrown by giant corporations who controlled society with an iron fist. To do their dirty work, the corporations created a race of bio-mechanical men called the Cyberons. They were programed to fight society's criminals, but soon the Cyberons discovered the corporations were the most ruthless criminals of all. The Cyberons were systematically hunted down and publicly executed by a fascist strike force known as the corporate police. - [Mechanical Voice] Cyberon alert. Two Cyberons are headed south in crime zone C, quadrant seven. Move in and terminate. - Hey Walker, why are you always so uptight? - I'm not uptight. I'm just cautious. - Relax, this time next week, we'll be on a shuttle to the moon. - [Electronic Voice] Cyberon's I.D. as Walker and Andrews. - [Commander] All units, intercept. Go. (sirens sounding) - The car. (breaking glass) (screeching tires) - Come on, go. (sirens sounding) (guns firing) - [Andrews] Double back. Corporate scum. Here they come. - Keep your eye on them. (dramatic orchestral music) We're not finished yet. - [Andrews] We'll never make the underground. Let's kick their fucking asses. - [Electronic Voice] Walker and Andrews have been apprehended by Strike Force Three. - [Man] Drop your guns. And your visors too. Against the wall. - [Man] Look here, boys, it's Walker and Andrews, the last two Cyberons. - [Man] There hasn't been a public execution in a long time. - [Man] Forget it, let's waste 'em now. - [Man] Orders are to bring 'em in alive. - [Man] In what condition? (grunting) (punching) (grunting) (dramatic orchestral music) - Andrews, let's go. (guns firing) Andrews! (groaning) - [Narrator] While Walker, the only remaining Cyberon, has to fight for survival on Earth, the wealthiest citizens live in opulence on the moon. Through fantasy computer programs, they escape reality to an Earth and a life that once was. - [Electronic Voice] Welcome to Ultra-Dream by Virtual Reality Systems. There is a limit to the imagination where your wildest dreams meets your deepest fears. You are about to go beyond that limit. (mysterious orchestral music) (zapping) (zinging) (screaming) (ominous orchestral music) (heavy nervous breathing) - [Electronic Voice] Did you enjoy your VRS experience, Howard? - You gotta really know when to stop. - [Electronic Voice] Well, it is a prototype. (beeping) (groaning) (coughing) - How's it coming? - Oh it's um, there's still a few bugs. Boy, honey, when I first started designing VRS, Virtual Reality Systems, I didn't see it. But VRS, this is the future. Just imagine, anyone, I mean you, can be anyone you want to be in any story you want to live. I mean, you experience it as virtual reality. - I still think I prefer books. - But how can you compare them to stories that respond to your memories, thoughts? The stories are interactive. - [Electronic Voice] Howard, don't forget your shuttle. (grumbling) - Oh, the shuttle will leave in 15. - I hate it when you go to Earth. (kissing) Why can't they come here once? - I know honey. Look, big publishers are just like big corporations and when the senior editor says, go to Earth, I go to Earth. - [Electronic Voice] Howard, go to Earth. - [Howard] Bye. Oh, don't fool with the program. It's been a little rough, huh? (beeping) - [Electronic Voice] You have chosen Acu Dream from Virtual Reality Systems, designed by VRS programmer, Howard Morning. Sit back, relax, and let us control your mind. (loud honking signal) - [Flight Attendant] The captain has illuminated the no smoking sign. Please put seats and tray tables in their upright and locked positions. - [Intercom Voice] Primary five, five, seven, four. - [Flight Attendant] Estimated flight time to New Los Angeles, will be two hours and 22 minutes. (engines roaring to life) - [Captain] Thank you. - [Flight Attendant] You're welcome. - Today is the first day of the rest of your new life with New Body. Nine out of 10 doctors agree that major organs should be replaced before 45 years of age. Remember, at New Body, we have one for you. - [Intercom] The Terra Shuttle Company will not be responsible once you leave the terminal. The white zone is for loading and unloading of passengers only. Due to ongoing terrorist activities, all unattended vehicles will be destroyed immediately. The white zone is for loading and unloading of passengers only. Due to ongoing terrorist activities, all unattended vehicles-- - [Announcer] Welcome to Forest Park body disposal unit number 317. Our sympathies are with you during your time of sorrow. (dripping water) (beeping) - [Andrews] This time next week, we'll be on a shuttle to the moon. - It's getting weird out here, buddy. You're better off where you are. - It's a beauty all right. It's one of the last four in existence. They found it in an excavation in old town just last week. - Well, David Copperfield wouldn't sell many VRS programs. - No. Sales of your VRS program are sky rocketing. Marketing tells me that they can expect to ship over 50,000 units of your latest program. The corporation is very happy. - They're going to be a lot happier when they see the New Body program. I'm meeting a former New Body executive tonight. She's giving me some stolen information. I know this doesn't make sense but, New Body isn't science fiction. It's science fact. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Announcer] Welcome to New Body. Weight reduction and physical therapy, please go to the second floor. Genital enlargements go to the third floor. Organ transplantations, go to forth, fifth, and sixth floors. Organ donations are accepted at the service desk at the rear of the building. - The order was a white female, mid 20's. You can't keep up with demand, even with third world donors. I'm the last chance you have for quality organs. Now, I want my 500,000. - I can't give you more than 400, David. The heart is oversized. She was a drug addict. - It's not worth it. I'd rather crush it than give it to you for that. - All right. All right. 500,000. But this is the last time. We have a little problem. One of our corporate executives, Alana Johnson, is missing and she's stolen a vital computer disk. (people yelling) (slow percussion dance music) - Hey Howard. - [Howard] Katherine. (crowd hollering) - Are you Howard Morgan? I'm Alana. Quickly, I can't be seen. If they catch me, they'll kill me. - [Howard] Okay, you got it? - The cash first. This disk proves that New Body is stealing human body parts. New Body is worse than you think. (ringing) - [Man] Come on baby, I'll show you what a real man-- - [Woman] Hey, watch it, will ya? - [Man] Come on, come on. - [Woman] Let go of me, asshole. (grunting) - [Man] Hey. Get your hands off me, you son of a bitch. (grunting) Bastard. - I love this place. You wait here. - Move it, punk. - [Man] Let him go, robot trash. You're gonna be real sorry. - [Man] Kick his ass. Take his head off. What are you doing down here anyway? (angry yelling) (grunting) - Uh, excuse me. Easy. My name is Howard Morgan and I have a use for your talents. I can use a freelance collector like you. If you want the other half of this, you'll be at the Border Hotel, room 1530, 9:00 p.m. tomorrow night. (guns firing in the distance) - No, please. Please, oh please. (screaming) - You've been seeing another man, Alana. - It's not what you think. - I'm afraid it is. I want the disk back now. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Where's Howard Morgan? - Let me go. (scared heavy breathing) Let me go. (screaming) (distant siren sounding) (laughing) - The lower I go, the more exciting it gets. (pounding) (people talking loudly) (electronic buzzing) - [Announcer] Please take your seats. The laser blade games are beginning in one minute. Contestant one, the challenger, take odds at 87 to one. - Just know the rules of the game, do you? - [Announcer] Even odds. Have your pass or credit disk ready. Minimum bet is $10,000. Warning, do not look directly into the laser blade high bars. Let the game begin. (ruckus crowd talking and yelling) (zapping) (buzzing) - [Woman] Go for it, come on, come on. - Watch out! - Come on, you got her. Kill it, get it. - Kill her! - Come on, kid. (laughing) (cheering) (laughing) - [Announcer] Winner takes $250,000, William, the snake, Quigmier is champion for six nights in a row. - [Man] That's the word! Snake is king! The snake is now the one and-- (laughing) - [Woman] I love you, Howard. - You know? - [Woman] What? - Every time I'm with you, it's just one pleasure after another. (surprised gasping) (screaming) - [Woman] No, what are you doing? (ominous orchestral music) - [Man] You don't fuck with New Body. (ringing phone) - [Peter] Nancy, this is Peter. - Oh. - [Peter] Did I startle you? - Oh Peter, hi. No, it was a nice surprise. Howard there with you? - [Peter] I'm so sorry, Nancy, Howard, Howard is dead.

Due to ongoing terrorist activities-- (dramatic orchestral music) The white zone is for loading and unloading passengers only. Due to ongoing terrorist activity-- - Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to-- - [Man] Fuck off. - [Announcer] The white zone is for loading and unloading passengers only. Due to ongoing terrorist activity-- - Excuse me? (screaming) What are you doing? (laughing) Somebody help me! (crowd complaining) Shit. - [Announcer] This is crime control, precinct number nine, nine, seven. If your crime does not involve murder, rape or physical assault, please proceed to the automated terminals on floors one and two. To avoid unnecessary delays, have your personal identification code ready. - [Man] Hey, where do you think you're going? - [Man] What are you doing, man, come on, there's a line here in case you didn't see it. (knocking) - Take a number and sit. - [Announcer] Now serving number 17. - [Man] What is this? Hey babe, I've been in line for a long time. - [Announcer] Subgrades are not allowed to enter the Gates Memorial Detention Center. - My husband was murdered yesterday. I would like to speak to the person in charge. - There are people in front of you. - I can't wait for hours. - Lady, that number won't come up for days. - [Man] Hey, yeah, so go home. - My husband was murdered yesterday and you're telling me that I have to wait for days? - Lady, calm down. - That maniac is probably out there right now killing other people. - That's enough! - Enough? What's enough? You're sitting around here on your fat asses while people are out there being slaughtered in this place. - Shut up, lady. (crowd complaining) - Her name was Alana. She worked at New Body. Her heart was ripped out. - I don't care what her name was. You get out of here before I book you. - You piece of shit. - [Mrs Morgan] Who's in charge here? - I'm in charge here. Who's asking? - I'm Nancy Morgan. My husband was Howard Morgan. - So? - Morgan's that big time programmer who got ripped last night. - Oh, perfect. Captain Kramer. - How do you do? - I'm sorry about your husband. Come into my office. That's all the street patrol found on him. (somber orchestral music) (gasping) (crying) - What's this? - I thought maybe you could tell me. - No, I don't understand. Certainly you have more leads than this. - Well, no. Believe me, we don't like it when prominent citizens show up missing their hearts and livers. (siren sounding) I've been taking a lot of heat on this. Earth is a fucked up place. - At least give me an idea how you intend to proceed. (laughing) - Mrs Morgan, this city is a big place. - But you're the police. - Yeah. And we have more than 100 murders in my precinct alone everyday. - Yes, well, that may be true, Captain, but I expect you to find my husband's murderer. - Just a minute. Look, why don't you just go back to the moon. Sooner or later, we'll find something. - That's not enough. - We only wanted the disk back. You didn't have to kill Morgan. It was a mistake. - No, letting you call the shots was a mistake. New Body exists because of me. I go, it goes. - You can't shut down New Body, Hines. You're lucky we don't shut you down. Once we increase our organ donor supply from the third world, we won't need you anymore. Morgan had to go. He knew too much, but you were sloppy, Hines. Someone saw you rip him. Some guy in the alley and to make matters worse, now his wife is on your trail. This is where she's staying. Wait a minute! Don't forget the snitch. - I never forget a friend. - I'm Nancy Morgan. A Mr Peter Randall made a reservation for me. - Yes, would you excuse me please while I check. It'll take a moment. - Thank you. (walking footsteps) - The perfect killing machine. Over the centuries, the shark has changed very little. - You like sharks? - I like perfection. - Miss? You're correct. 1530. - Thank you. - [Dest Attendant] Would you check with the bellman on your floor please? - Yes. - [Desk Attendant] Thank you. Enjoy your stay. (squeaking door) (high frequency ringing) - What's the job? - What are you doing in my room? - Where's Howard Morgan? Are you his contact? - What did you have to do with him? How do you know Howard? - [Walker] I don't. - [Announcer] Cyberon walker has been located in crime zone J, quadrant 62. - [Man] Very good, the undercover unit's in place. Now we've got him. (ominous orchestral music) (crackling fire) - [Man] Hey android. Don't you get it man? You don't come down to this part of the neighborhood. (squeaking door) - What do you say, Joey, we tear this thing up and maybe sell him for scraps, huh? (laughing) What do you think, android? How about a little game of wreck the robot? - Maybe you boys ought to play someplace else. - [Man] No, no. Roadkill, tear this thing up. (aggressive yelling) (grunting) (cracking) (pained screaming) (grunting) (dramatic orchestral music) - Come on, man. I'm your friend, we can work this, let's help each other, you know what I'm saying? (clanging) - [Announcer] Undercover unit has been eliminated by Cyberon Walker. - I've never been to Earth before, Gus. I don't know where Howard would go. Got any ideas? - I don't know. Probably hit the Zonarosa with the rest. - The what? - The Red Zone. You know, the hot box. The skin connection. - No, he wasn't like that. - I'm not so sure. - How far is this Zonarosa? - 11 blocks to Heaven. (laughing) - Thank you. - Hey, you don't want to go there alone. (upbeat percussion music) (people talking loudly) - [Woman] Warm or cold? - It's cold. - No, do you want your zans warm or cold? - Zans? Oh no, um, may I have some water please? (laughing) Water, that's a good one. Where the hell do you expect me to get water? - Fine, zans, cold. - Good. - I also need some information. I'm trying to find out where my husband went last night. Now there's a possibility that he could have been somewhere here in the Zonarosa. Maybe he was with another man, uh, he's big, wears a visor. - Honey, give the guy a break. We all need a change of pace. - Keep it. He was murdered. His heart was cut out. - This is Two One, ask him. I heard he saw something. - Did you see my husband last night? - Hmm. - Howard Morgan, story programmer. - My memory's going. Must be getting old. - Here, yeah, yeah, yeah, how much? - How much you got? - Did you see anything? - It was a slaughter. He never had a chance. - You saw who did it? - Why do you want to find this guy? He'll rip you soon as look at you. - Please. Just tell me anything you know. (ominous orchestral music) You said they when you talked about the murder. - Your husband and his girlfriend. - [Nancy] They were together? - [Two One] Arm in arm until the end. They were in the truck at Darrow 2000. Maybe the bartender saw something. (somber orchestral music) (sobbing) - You son of a bitch! (metal clanging) (sobbing) (ominous orchestral music) (ringing phone) - [Woman] Captain Kramer, there's an emergency phone call for you on visual, line six. - Precinct nine, nine, seven. - Hello? Hello? Is Captain Kramer there, please? - I'm sorry ma'am, the captain's not available right now. - This is very important. Nancy Morgan. Will you please have him call me at the hotel? - Yes ma'am. Thank you. (static buzzing) (upbeat dance music) (energetic crowd hollering) - Excuse me. Is this seat taken? - No. - Two One said that you could help me. He told me that Howard Morgan was in here last night. Well, he's uh, he's tall. He has sandy brown hair. He was probably with a woman. Do you remember him? - Follow me. - What's your name? - My name's Farny. If you're friends with Two One, you probably know his sister, Tai. She reads the cards. She sees the future. Tai, she says she knows your brother. - Farny, how many times have I told you not to put strangers in my face? - [Farny] Sorry, goodbye. - Get your ass out of here. - Tell me. I'm going to find out who killed him with your help or not. - You just don't get it, do you? This guy killed my best friend, Alana, over a fucking computer disk. He eats FC's for breakfast, so why don't you get your ass out of here right now while you can. - I don't know what you're talking about and I'm very sorry about your friend, but he killed my husband and I'm not going to let him get away with it. - Well, I'm sorry. I can't help you. - Wait. This is the number where you can reach me. I hope you change your mind. (upbeat dance music) (rowdy crowd yelling) - You're a very popular guy around here. (distant siren sounding) (dramatic orchestral music) - You said something about my being popular? - Yeah. Some woman was looking for you. - Did she divulge the source of her curiosity? - Huh? - What'd she want, Farny? - She thinks you might have killed her husband. Some famous guy. - Who gave her that idea? - Maybe Tick Tock or Two One. They didn't tell her much though, just that you might have killed a girl named Alana. - Anything else? - Oh, you wouldn't have, people usually pay me for information. - It's a quaint custom. (loud dramatic orchestral music) Time for a change. - [Announcer] All freelance collectors and bounty hunters must carry personal identification codes with them at all times. Prisoners must be shackled and under control while on the premises. (grunting) Freelance collector, Walker, report to the prisoner reformation booth now. - 14,000. - That's 14,000 dead, only 10,000 alive. (lively crowd complaining) - [Walker] Next time, you won't be so lucky. - Excuse me. You were the one in my hotel room last night. The $100,000 belonged to my husband. I want to find out who killed him. - [Walker] It wasn't me. - Then help me find who did it. (beeping) Don't you? - What? - I'll pay you $50,000. - Cash or credit disk? - Whatever you prefer. - Cash. - Then you'll do it? - Maybe. - We should have never killed a programmer. Hines is suffering from a severe psychosis. He's out of control. - Little longer. We can retire Mr Hines, permanently. - I've had enough. - I'll handle it. (loud dramatic orchestral music) (whimpering) - YOu've got two things I'm going to take. Your body, your soul. (screaming) - [Man] Organ swipers still around. New Body needs this thing cleaned up immediately. She called a couple of hours ago. She's at the hotel. Make it look like an accident or a suicide, but do it now! We need her dead! (signaling elevator) (ringing phone) - [Machine] This is Walker. Leave a message. - Walker, it's Nancy. Please pick up, Walker, if you're there. I'm at the hotel. There's someone in my room. (dramatic orchestral music) (startled gasping) - Oh, I'm sorry. - Gus, there's someone in my room. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Gus] There's nobody in here. (gun firing) (struggling) (breaking glass) (screaming) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gasping) - Face lift? (grunting) (aggressive yelling) - [Man] Zane, leave. (gun firing) (button beeping) (slow dramatic music) - Shit. - You're cut. - I know. - He's strong. He's as strong as me. - We're going to correct that right now. Lie down. (electricity zapping) - Who was he? - I'm not sure. But I have an idea. - Walker, who was that man? I've seen him before. - I don't know, but I'm going to find out. - Well, it'll be okay. We were so sure you guys were going to replace us all. - Yeah, we didn't even make it 10 years. - Feel that? Um, I can't be caught working on you. - She's okay. (high pitched whistling) (sizzling) - Andrews hadn't been around in a long time. - Andrews is dead. The corporate police terminated him last week. - Then you're the last. - Maybe. - [Announcer] Cyberon alert. Walker and an unidentified female have been tracked to the medical facility's annex. - [Commander] There are no corporate police in the area. Alert the facility's security forces. - You're the last what? - There were 10 of us designed here. Project Cyberon. Corporate controllers. Our function was to stop corporate crime, but the corporations were the criminals. - Freeze, right there. (gun firing) (grunting) - Reflex. - She's here alone. She's trying to track down Hines. That takes guts. - Look, she's crazy. - Why are you being such a hard ass about her? - Because I don't want to be responsible for some rich lunar bitch. - I just don't want to see anybody else hurt, like Alana. - I don't know. Just let the police help her. - The police can't even help themselves. - Right. Go straight ahead. What the hell is so important you had to see me now? And here? - You set me up. - You're insane. - She knew I was coming and she had company, an FC. Our agreement is terminated. (suspenseful orchestral music) - I don't have to listen to this crap. - You do what I say. - You come into my precinct station and you threaten me? (screaming) (loud ominous orchestral music) (groaning) - [Nancy] Do you ever feel lonely? - The only thing you get from feelings is dead. I watched and felt nine of us die. Turner was right. I am the last. - The last what? I mean, you never really told me. You were part of a Cyberon project, a hybrid? - I don't know. All I know is, they were the only family I ever had. When the corporations made us, they gave us emotions, morals, and ethics. When we discovered the corporations were destroying the planet, they created the corporate police and hunted us down like animals. They got Winfrey first. He never knew what hit him. Didn't suspect a thing. None of us did. But we quickly learned our lesson. Wiser and Katkin tried to escape to the underground. They could have made it too. They were set up. Corporate police tracked them and then waited. It was a perfect trap. They never had a chance. (explosions) Fernandez was captured. There was a mock trial. - [Group] Guilty. - [Walker Voiceover] And he was executed on national television. The public watched on. When they caught King and Parnell, there was another broadcast. The rest tried to escape to the moon. They hijacked the mining vessel. There was a massive space battle, an incredible fight. They didn't make it either. That left me and Andrews. And they picked him off last week. (gun firing) Andrews! - You made it. - Did I? I survived by collecting the slime of society. - I owe you my life. - You don't owe me anything, except 500 grand. - Here. (slow somber orchestral music) - Thanks. - Will you hold me? (ringing phone) - [Woman] Precinct nine, nine, seven. - Uh, Captain Kramer please. It's Dr Sato. - [Woman] Oh, Dr Sato, um, there's been some trouble. You see, Captain Kramer died last night. - Oh my God. Uh, how? - [Woman] It's awful. He was murdered. Somebody ripped his heart out. They left it on his desk. - Whoa, whoa, sole mio. Ha, ha, the game, the game. (laughing) There's a game, yeah. (electronic buzzing) - Looks like your lucky day, Two. I've run across a sport's man. - It's a nice game if you like this sort of thing. I don't care much for it, personally. - No, at least until someone dies, Two. - We can always call for help. Help! Help! (zapping) (buzzing) You're not going to get away with it. Somebody told you wrong. I'm not the one you want. - Don't look at me! Look at me! I believe you. (ringing) - Things getting out of hand, doctor? - How did you get in here? What do you want? - Hines. - Never heard of him. - Oh, come on. You remember Alana. She met the slime when she worked here. - Yes, of course. - The bastard ripped her. Now it's his turn. - She had no corporate loyalty. Alana was greedy and it caught up with her. - Fuck you and fuck your corporation. Don't you tell me about greedy. I'll tell you what, doctor. I'll make you a deal. You tell me where Hines is and I won't tell the D.A. that Hines supplies New Body with black market organs. I'm disappointed, doctor. New Body isn't so new. It's just old fashioned murder. Nancy Morgan, please. - [Woman] She's not in at the moment. - Okay, I'll leave a message. Tell her that Hines lives in the zone near the old com center. He'll be in the Trocadero Club tonight. (loud dramatic orchestral music) (screaming) (grunting) (spitting) - The Trocadero Club, okay. That's all? Thank you. Someone just called the hotel and left a message. They said Hines lives in the Zonarosa, near the commonet building. - [Walker] The Trocadero Club is where Howard approached me. - [Nancy] That's the last place he was seen alive. (flames crackling) - [Man] There's Entrepidero. Let's do it. (upbeat dance music) (grunting) (gun firing) (screaming) (grunting) - Get your fuckin' hands off of me! - You're causing me a lot of trouble. - Freeze! (shots firing) (dramatic orchestral music) (grunting) (shots firing) - [Nancy] You all right? - [Walker] About 80%. Let's go. (shots firing) (loud dramatic orchestral music) - [Announcer] Cyberon alert. Gunfire outside the Trocadero Club. - [Man] Punch up the visual. - [Announcer] Cyberon I.D. confirmed. It's Walker. He's headed for the underground. - [Man] Alert all units. We can't track him once he goes under. - [Man] Going down, android. Down to the depths of hell. And we're waiting for you. - I'm game. - [Walker] Careful. There could be some live wires. (zapping) (screaming) - [Nancy] Walker! (crashing) Walker! (fast suspenseful orchestral music) (screeching tires) - Looks like you got a little caught up in your work. (grunting) Let's see what a guy like you is made of. (zapping) (pained yelling) Congratulations, you are the last. (screaming) (gun firing) - Walker. They're getting away. (dripping water) (screeching tires) Are you all right? - About 70%. How about you? (tired breathing) - 87. - Here. It's ready to go. - [Nancy] Walker, what do you see? - [Walker] My visor's not picking up anything, but I know they're close. (dripping water) (slow dramatic orchestral music) - Where are we? - We're in the underground. After the big quake, they just built on top of the ruins. Somewhere near Hope Street. Come on, let's go. (suspenseful orchestral music) Where's Hines? - Right here. (startled screaming) You're here. I'm so happy. Take your visors off now. Now! Let's watch him die. (whirring club) (battle cries) (clanging steel) - Come on! (aggressive yelling) (grunting) (grunting) (sirens sounding) - [Woman] All units taking position. - [Hines] Zang, Zang, Zang! It's the corporate police, leave! - [Mechanical Voice] Status report requested. - [Man] All units in position. Waiting for orders to move into the underground. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Electronic Voice] Units three and four, move into the underground. - [Man] Orders confirmed. Units three and four moving in. Estimated time of capture, two minutes. - [Hines] Oh, it's time for you to die, Miss Morgan. (gun firing) (pained yelling) (grunting) (dramatic orchestral music) (aggressive yelling) (electronic zapping) (grunting) (zapping) (exploding) (battle cry) (crashing) (running footsteps) (pained crying) - What? (pained yelling) - Get in the chair! Lock yourself in. We'll activate the laser blade pylon. (screaming) Your other hand! - [Man] Freeze! (exploding) (heart beating) (loud frequency pulsing) (exhausted breathing) (slow suspenseful orchestral music) - Well? What do you think of my new program? (upbeat dramatic orchestral music)
