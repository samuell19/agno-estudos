Now she's been promoted up the force, out of the Academy, out of basic training. - Oh, my hair, uh, good for her! - Excuse me. - Uh, parole hearing is in there, miss. - Uh no, I'm Didi's sister, Candy. - That's right, she just transferred here this morning, didn't you? - And you must be Miss Devonshire. I'm so excited to meet you. Andl I'm really looking forward to working my way up the ladder here. - Didi's sister. Well, that would explain it, why you're dressed like that. You're undercover as a hooker. - Uh, no, I've got a date. (rock music) (horn honks) - Someone give that man a citation for all that racket! - Oh, he's here, I gotta go, bye! - Bye. (rock music) (tires screeching) Oh, Miss Devonshire, I have some paperwork I'd like you organize for me if you wouldn't mind. You might just check for punctuation, spelling, grammar, you know. While you're at it, why don't you, well, just go ahead and retype the whole mess, okay? - And you need this by when, sir? - Oh, I suppose first thing tomorrow morning is soon enough. You know, you might also spice it up, give it a couple of your witty anecdotes here and there, all right? - Oh, yeah, sir. - Oh, Miss Devonshire, by the way, what have you heard about that prisoner that Holly's been watching? - Nothing yet, sir, but I'm sure she'll inform us as soon as she learns anything at all. - Good, good, good, well, let's just hope that the things I've heard about prison are only rumors. (rock music) (prisoners clamoring) (swanky music) - Look, there she is! - Whoo! - Yeah, all right! - Get away from me. I mean it, get away from me! Stop, no, don't, I mean it, don't, no! (laughing) No, don't, no. Get away from me, get away from me! - For the last time, it's your turn to sweep up tonight. - Okay, scum, break it up! (whimsical music) - [Prisoner] Oh, whoo, yeah! - All right, time to get back in your cells! (prisoners clamoring) Yeah, you better watch that group. They're known around here as the Rotten Apples. They're good for nothin'! - That's anything. - I'm telling you, it was just like stabbing a pillow. - Listen, if I were you, I'd keep my voice down. I heard a woman who got convicted for something she told her cellmate. - Yeah, and where's her cellmate now? (laughs) - Would you shut up in there? - Yeah, and what's it to you? - Did I ever tell you about my last cellmate? I have this problem, I always hurt the person that I love. - Oh, save it for later! - If I was to break out of here tonight, would you come with me? - What are you blabbering about now? - You heard me, are you coming or not? - I don't think it's a very good idea. - Just watch and see. - Guard, guard, come quick! - Who rattled your cage? - Listen, I need to make an urgent phone call. - You and everyone else. - No listen, listen, I'm a vice cop! - You're what, you're what? - Nothing, nothing. Guard, come quick, there's someone choking in here! - What are you talking about, there's nobody choking. - Oh, no? (woman gasping) - Guard, wait, come back! - Oh, watching you like this gets me all hot and bothered. - Oh, get off of me! (woman coughing) - What in the hell's going on here? - I don't know, why don't you get a look at her? - You okay? (prisoners cheering) - That's one down, now who's ready to go? (prisoners cheering) (upbeat music) (prisoners clamoring) (Holly yelping) - Oh, playing hard to get again. - These two are having too much fun, let 'em be. - Hey, you! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - [Woman] All right, you girls have exactly five seconds to quit what you're doing and get back to your cells. Anyone left in the hallways will be severely penalized. - Eat lead! (gun firing) - I think we should go back. - Oh, shut up and follow me! (dramatic music) Thanks, I couldn't have done it without you. - Don't mention it. - Hey, stay right where you are! - Eat my dust! (police sirens blaring) (dramatic music) - Jeez, I don't know how you do it. You're right on time! - We need money fast. - A bank teller machine. - You've gotta be kidding. (laughs) (sirens blaring) - Come back here with that newspaper or I'll make a citizen's arrest! (sigh) Oh, I hope I'm not late for the Home Shopping Club. (woman moaning) Keep it down in there! Don't you know this is a family building? Honestly. Don't I do enough while I am at work? A nice hot cup of coffee should sooth my nerves, then I can type this report and make my lunch for tomorrow. Oh! Out of milk again, wouldn't you know it. - [Woman On TV] Hi, it's me, Fantasia. - (groans) You would not believe the day I just had. That man I work for could drive anybody crazy. - That's nice. - Uh, where do you keep the milk? No, wait, the half-and-half. - In the back case. - Thanks, oh, and where do you keep the knee-high stockings? - Over there next to the condoms. - Thank you. - Perfect, just the place. Give me your coat. - Here you go. - Okay, I think I'm ready to make a large withdrawal. (sinister music) - Well, that should do it. Oh, let me get a copy of today's paper. - Now, I want you to give-- - Excuse me, miss, I was here first! - This will only take a minute. - [Miss Devonshire] You will have to wait your turn. - Listen, I'm first! - My mistake. - Now you listen carefully. - Yeah? - I want you to empty out the cash register and put it in a paper bag. - Yeah, yeah, uh, whatever you say. (cash register dings) - And a bottle of wine that'll give me a good buzz. And don't give me no trouble. (alarm blares) You fool, I told you not to try anything! - Look, I hope they lock you up and throw away the key. - Why, you! - Now remember, first I handcuff you, you start to struggle, then I go for the nightstick. - Got it. - Resisting arrest, huh? Looks like you're gonna have to learn about the long arm of the law. - [Man On Radio] Attention, a liquor store robbery has been reported Tujunga and Ahora Park. All officers in the area report at once. The robber is suspected to be armed. - What the, that's just around the corner from here! I'll be right there. - Wait, come back! (sirens blaring) - Hey, where's my wine? - Uh, sorry. - Good, now, if I get out of here without any more trouble, nobody's gonna get hurt. - None from me! - Oh, it's your turn now, miss. - Oh, thank you. (laughs) - Nobody move! - Oh no! - Huh? - Vice cop, what's the problem here? - No problem here. You, see I'm robbing this store and I got me a hostage. - Miss Devonshire! - You two know each other? - Oh, for God sakes, Candy, go back to your date and let this woman make a run for it. - Lady, you're coming with me right now! - Oh, please, we'll let you go. - The hell we will, you've got five seconds to let her go. (glass shattering) - Make me! - Quick, Candy, what was your last score on the firing range? Was it one out of six? - Zero out of six. - Oh God! Ahh! (gunshot blasting) (screaming) (glass shatters) - Ms. Devonshire, are you alright? - Candy, when will you ever learn proper police procedure? - Miss, this is yours. (police sirens wailing) (helicopter whirring) (coughing) - Wait'll they get a load of me now! (laughing) (ceremonial music) - You know Ms. Devonshire, are you absolutely certain you're up to this? If you're not I can certainly conduct the ceremony. I know it's a traumatizing thing being taken hostage. - Shut up! This is just what I need. (mic feedback) [Devonshire] Alright, everybody get your butts outside for the Field Day competition pronto! - Field Day, great. We were supposed to go to chapel today. (cheering) (patriotic music) - Thank you all for attending the annual Vice Officers Versus The Prisoners Field Day Event. This year the Commissioner and I will be your judges. Now let the competition begin. And remember, any prisoner winning her event receives a five day work furlough program. - Ms. Devonshire, the inmate you asked me to keep an eye on? She escaped last night. I tried to call you-- - I know she escaped, you idiot. I was the one who, someone's watching us. Now just a minute! This is the Vice Officer's refreshment table. - Give me that hose! - Wait your turn! - This is your refreshment table. - Oh Holly! I have something very important I want you to do at today's event. - Really? - Yes. - Do you want me to be a commentator? - No, no, I want you to wear the helmet cam. (bonk) Perfect. - Now our first event is just a minute. Hurry up peeling those potatoes, we need these sacks for the race. As I was saying, our first event is the sack race. Is everybody at the starting point? (quirky music) (trumpets blaring) (gun blasting) (cheering) - Woooo! - [Inmate] Great job, Kim! - And in the first event that's Vice Academy 10 points! Prisoners, aw, a big goose egg. - Congratulations. - Thank you! - I heard you were a pro in the sack. - Why you - Oh no no no, now girls, break it up now, it's just a competition! Oh, Holly, careful with that helmet cam. It's very expensive. - Now let's check that scoreboard one more time. Oh my! It looks like the prisoners aren't trying very hard. And the next event is charades! - Come on, come on, we're up next. Okay, look in the envelope. Good one. - Daisies? Oh, is it picking flowers? - Very good! - Congratulations, and if you win this event you are eligible for the five day work furlough program. - Come on girls, come on, come on! Chop chop! Okay, open your envelopes. - Hey, do we get to use props for this? - Oh surely. (whacking) - [Inmate] What the hell, dude? What are you doing? - Is it beaten with a baseball bat? - No, I'm sorry that was beaten senseless with a baseball bat. No points. (groaning) - I know you had something to do with this. - Whatever do you mean? - You know I have had just about enough of you-- - Come on, Holly, Holly! Come on, they're waiting for you. The next one is a bullwhip breaking skin. - No, no, I'm not doing it! - What's going on here? - Holly is being a party pooper. - Oh she is? - Are you sure you're okay? I think you ought to try to bleach this color out. - Don't worry about it. - I think it looks hot on you. - Later. This stuff doesn't even give me a buzz anymore. You got everything ready? - Yeah, I brought the unmarked car just like you said. (tires screeching) (upbeat music) (screaming) - Get in, this is your chance of a lifetime! (cheering) - Melanie, is that you? - That's me alright, but from now on call me Malathion! - What happened to you? - Are you coming or not? - With you? No, you're crazy. - Suit yourself! (upbeat music) (honking) - How could something like this happen? - Who was that? - That was my cellmate Melanie. She says her new name now is Melathion. - Yeah, that's Melanie, I know, I watched her. - Yeah, another job well done. - That cheap wine, I would recognize that anywhere. That was the woman who held me hostage last night! - Are you sure? She didn't look so New Wave last night. - Well she's obviously done something to disguise her appearance. - I don't think green is her color. - Excuse me, miss oh, what was your name? - Me? Samantha. - Tell me, why didn't you go with her? - Because Sir, I won the work furlough program and I didn't want to lose it. - Well that's damn commendable! Of course you'll have some explaining to do. - Yes Holly, you will, you let that woman escape from prison, and you Candy did nothing to stop her rampage. - I was speaking to you, Ms. Devonshire. - Me?! - Yes! It was your idea to have this whole damn Field Event Day! If you hadn't rile those poor prisoners they would have never escaped! Let's just hope that your girls catch them before they do any serious damage, eh? - Yes, Sir! - Does this mean that I'm back on active duty? - Yes, Holly. - Let's do it! - Does this mean you're cop? You used me! - Oh please. - Yes, very commendable, Malanta. - Samantha, Sir. - Right. Now we have to find you some suitable place of work. (celebratory music) Any particular line of work you'd like to pursue? - When I was in Grammar School I studied dance. - Here's a position for a topless waitress, Sir. - Ms. Devonshire, I hardly think that would be appropriate. - Oh, when I was in High School I studied acting. - Here's a job opening for a phone sex operator. - I really like to sing. - Here it is. The perfect job. (jazzy music) - Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, can you tell me where lzzie is? - I'm trying to dance here. - Yeah, I can see you're trying to dance. I'm trying to ask you a question. - What are you dressed up as? - What does it look like? I'm a clown, you got it? - Yeah, I got it. Izzie's over there. - Thanks. Are you lzzie? - Yeah babe, that's me. - For some reason I pictured lzzie to be a little boy. - Wrong, I'm lzzie. What do you want? - Well lzzie, I have a telegram. - A telegram for me? You got to be kidding. - No. (clears throat) I know today's your birthday, it's a very special day, and I want to send this message hope things go your way (laughs) - This is too much. - Now you made me lose my place. - Aw, I'm sorry. - I want to send this message to hope things go your way, now you're one year older and you're still dear to me. - Hey hey, go finish your dance over there! - Listen, you interrupt my song one more time I'm going to carve these lyrics on your body. You got it? - Yes, ma'am, finish your song. - Good. So now you're one year older, and you're still dear to me, hope your day is joyous, and happy as can be. Love, your mother. - Thank you, that was beautiful. - You're welcome. You got a bathroom here? - It's in the back. - Thanks. - That's lzzie's kind of woman. - Alright, nobody move! You behind the counter, start emptying out that register. - Hey, it's my birthday, give me a break! - Do it, birthday boy! (gunshot blasting) - Quick, get me the police! (register clinging) - Alright, everybody else, empty those pockets! Give me all your belongings! Come on honey, reach for it! I want it all, I want the loose change too! - I hope you fry in the chair. (laughs) - Check if there's anyone in back. (horn honking) - Gimme the gun! - Mirana, what's going on back there? - Police! Don't move! - What the? - We got here as soon as we could. - Looks like you're a little late. - Oh. ' YUM! - Get out of her, sour grape. - That's Rotten Apple. - I called you as soon as I heard the robbery taking place. I caught this one in the back. - Nice job, Samantha. - Thanks. Don't worry, I got this under control. (sirens blaring) - You know Ms. Devonshire, I think you've got this girl pegged out all wrong. I think there's a positive future for her in vice enforcement. - Yes Sir, I guess my career choice came in handy. - You know Ms. Devonshire, she's going to need a place to stay for the next few days. Would you mind if she bunks in with you? - But Sir, my place is rather small as it is. - Oh I'm sure she won't mind at all. Thank you. - I did help bring the prisoners in. At least two of those bruised peaches are behind bars now. - That's Rotten Apples. - Whatever. - Now look what I've got. This is the tape from the surveillance camera in the liquor store. Should we look at it? (quirky music) - You would not believe the day I just had. That man I work for could drive anybody crazy. - [Store owner] That's nice. - Uh, that's crazy with dedication, Sir. No, wait, the Half and Half. Well that should do it. Oh, let me get a copy of today's paper. - Well look, there she is now, there's that troublemaker. - Yeah, look, she still has her prison uniform on. - Yeah, didn't that strike you as rather odd, Ms. Devonshire? - Uh, no, it didn't. - Hmmm. - [Devonshire] Excuse me, Miss. I was here first. - This'll only take a minute. - You will have to wait your turn! - [Melanie] Listen, I'm first! - That woman is clearly concealing a gun underneath her coat, now did anybody notice that? - Um, no, didn't. - Now you listen carefully, I want you to empty out the cash register and put it in a paper bag. - Yeah, whatever you say. - And a bottle of wine that'll give me a good buzz. Don't give me no trouble. (alarm rings) You fool! - Look, here comes my part. - Oh, it's your turn now, Miss. - Thank you. - Nobody move! - [Devonshire] Oh no! - You know Candy, you look about 20 pounds heavier on screen. - Yeah, well if you would've been watching, that woman, she wouldn't have broken out of prison. - Girls, I am trying to watch the tape! - Lady, you're coming with me now! - Oh please, we'll let you go! - The hell We Will! You've got 5 seconds to let her go! - [Melanie] Make me! - Quick Candy, what was your last score on the firing range? Was it one out of six? - Zero out of six. - Zero out of six?! I thought you said she had a perfect score, Ms. Devonshire! - Did I? - Well you (gunshot blasting) - I've seen enough. Ms. Devonshire, you and your girls are taken off active duty as of immediately. Tomorrow morning you can report to the filing department. That is all! I'll see you in the morning, Sambuka. - Uh, Samantha, Sir. - Yes. - Ms. Devonshire, how long is that work furlough program? - Five days. - Good. I can put a stop to it in less time than that. So Samantha, now that you're on the force I guess you can join us for our little girl's night out. - Oh gee, I don't know, I got all this training to do. - Nonsense, we'll be ready at seven o'clock, we'll pick you up then. (nightclub music) - Did we have to come here? - It's part of our little tradition. - What tradition? - Shut up, Candy! We're here to have a good time. Bartender, drinks for me and my friends! - Excuse me, I've had a little too much to drink. Can you help me to my seat? - Sure. You're right, you have had too much to drink. So... - So what'll it be tonight, ladies? - The usual. - Well since I've never seen you in here before the usual what? (laughs) - You're funny. - Hello, lzzie. - Oh, not you again. Whatever you babes are drinking, it's on lzzie. - Now that's more like it, we need four shot glasses and a bottle of your finest liquor. - Yes, ma'am, coming right up. - Now that's service. So tell us about yourself, Melanie. - It's Samantha. - Whatever. - Anyway, I started out as-- - Oop, our shot glasses are here. Let's have a toast. A toast to our futures. Happy future. - [Girls] Happy future! - Come on, you're not drinking. - Yeah, I know, I have to be up early in the morning. - Oh it's early now. - Well I hate to drink alone. - You're not alone! (giggles) Hey now, isn't this cozy? - Samantha, what were you saying about yourself before? - Oh, I started to say that-- - Oh Candy, stop interrupting. We're about to have a drink. - One more round! That really hit the spot. (hiccups) Excuse me, ladies. (laughs) - Hi there. - Hey Sailor, out on a weekend pass? - I beg your pardon? - You don't have to beg for me, baby. Let me be your port in the storm. - So Samantha, tell me what you do with your time. - Well recently I spent most of my time in prison. Guess I started hanging out with the wrong crowd. - Where were you in prison? - In the cell next to you. - Now these are the two I was telling you about. This one's Candy, Holly. - I'm Candy. - I'm Holly. - Nice to meet 'cha! - Say, I was thinking. We could all get a little sneaky peaky and head back to my place, huh? - The more the merrier. - Ms. Devonshire, with all due respect, you hardly know these men. - Keep your jealousy to yourself. This one's mine! - Which one's mine? - Take your pick, I got dibs on this guy. - Well, I have to go. Bye. - Bye. - Party pooper! - I hear you can rent a room in the back here. - Why would I want to rent a room? I've already got an apartment. - I think I love you. What's your name? I want to have it tattooed across my chest. - Griselda. - Hey! Another round here! - Alright, I think you broads have had enough for tonight. - Hey, that is no way to speak to my friends, pal! (smack) (yelping) (laughing) (celebratory music) - Ah, right on time. A fine way to start your first day at work, Miranda. - Uh, Samantha, Sir, thank you. - Sit down. Now I hope that Ms. Devonshire didn't mind having you stay with her last night. - Uh, actually Sir, she didn't come home last night. - Really? Doesn't seem like Ms. Devonshire at all. Well anyway, I want you to tell me everything you can about this Malathion woman. Anything you can do to help us capture her. - Well I know that she's very (phone rings) - Excuse me. Yello? What? Are you sure? Yeah, I'll be right there. Excuse me. - It's your fault that this happened. - Will you stop yelling? I've got a splitting migraine. - Feeling at home again while we're in here? - You know you just better watch it. - You tell her, hunny! - You shut up! Oh Commissioner, I am so glad you are here. - What happened to you two? - Just get us out of here. - Get me a key for this door! - Yes, Sir. - [Devonshire Voiceover] I don't know where I'd been the night before but I had a fresh tattoo to show for it. - Ms. Devonshire, honestly. Honestly. Ms. Devonshire, I had no idea that by taking you off active duty there'd be so much damage done. - No Sir, I mean yes, Sir, I mean please please please put me back on active duty now. Please don't put me through another night of this misery. - Please don't beg. The answer's no. Because this is going to be a black mark on the Vice Academy records and I read: "Lewd and disorderly conduct, "drunken brawling, "Resisting arrest?!" - I'm sorry, Sir. I don't know how my girls could have clone all that. - Your girls? This is your file! - On - Got the key? - Get back in there. - Yes. - We're almost out of cash from that liquor store holdup. You got any ideas for any quick cash? - You just watch me. (delightful music) - Excuse me, Ma'am. - Yeah? - Hand over your purse! - I beg your pardon? - I said give me your purse! - Leave me alone! - Don't make me use this. (screaming) (laughing) - Somebody help me, I've been robbed! - Calm down, ma'am. - Somebody stole my purse! - Me too! - She sprayed me right in the face! - Okay, let me get this down. - [Woman] Somebody stole my purse! - What is going on here? - All these women have been robbed. - Yes, she took everything I had! - All my belongings! - [Woman] Me too! - Just calm down, calm down. Do you have your sketch pad, Officer? - Yes Sir, right here, Sir. - You think you can identify this person? - Yes. - Yeah. - Well good good, I don't know who's responsible for this, but we've got to stop them! Particularly before the press gets this story. - Green hair. - Green, much more green. - Bigger head. - Attitude. - Now bigger hair. - And attitude, attitude. - Yeah. - Yes, that's her, she's the one who robbed me with a can of hair spray. She's a threat to the community and the environment. (laughing) - Great take! I can't remember having this much fun. - I think I'm gonna buy me a fur coat. - You know, seeing all this money gets me hot! - You don't say! (laughing) - Whoop! - You should have seen it. It was awful! - What are you talking about? - We were waiting in the car while Rosie and Loretta were holding up The Seedy Bar. They were barely inside when the cop shows up and nabs them both! - What?! Did you get any of the cash from them? - Are you kidding? We were lucky to get out of there! - Who could be onto us already? - Some cop dressed up like a clown. You ask me, it's a pretty good cover. - Well no one's asking you. - Hey, look at this. A former prison inmate, who is now on the force, single handedly captured a pair of the escaped convicts right in the middle of a holdup and she did it while dressed as a clown. - What, let me see that! Why that little, that's Samantha, she used to be my cellmate. - Your cellmate? - I should have strangled her while I had the chance. I can't believe this! - Well what do you want us to do about it? - I'll take care of her. And the rest of that worthless Vice Squad! (dramatic music) (laughs) (phone rings) - Hello? Oh, he's here now? Oh good, good, I'll be right there. Holly, Candy, come with me. There's someone I want you to meet. I've decided I'm going to call in a specialist to help us with our situation. Professor Kaufinger. - Professor Kaufinger? - Yes, he's gonna study the effects of insects spraying right here in our police lab. Maybe he can tell us what possesses this Malathion woman. Course he's going to need a good assistant, so which one of you wants to volunteer? - Gosh, it's really tempting, but - Putting your filing system in order is something I would really hate to miss out on. - Now girls, girls, girls, he only needs one of you, come on. - Candy, congratulations, you beat me to it. - Hey wait a minute! - Hello, Commissioner. Sorry I'm late, I just finished my workout at the gym. - You're Professor Kaufinger? - Yes I am. Are you going to be my assistant? - Uh, no. I'm your assistant. My name's Candy. - Nice to meet you. I'm gonna go change. Meet me at the lab in a few minutes. - I'll be right there. - Well as you were. - Listen Candy, I've reconsidered. I'll take the job. - The hell you Will! - The hell I won't! - Candy, I really see no reason why we Excuse me. - Would you mind closing the door? - I've decided that I'd like to be your lab assistant also. - Fine, there's an extra lab coat in the back. - Thank you. - I didn't want to spill anything on my clothes. - I see. - I didn't want to spill anything on my clothes. Excuse us. Listen, you conniving hussy, what do you think you're up to? - I'm going to be his assistant. - Yeah, well he's way out of your league. - What do you mean by that?! - He's good looking and a professional! - Girls, I'm waiting. ' [Girls] Coming! - Could one of you get a beaker over there? - Certainly. - I'll do it! - Give me that, you don't even know what a beaker looks like! - [Girls] Here you go! - Thank you. - My name is Holly, I didn't catch your first name. - Nice to meet you, I'm Dirk. Dirk, you know that name really suits you. I took several Chemistry tests in school. They should prove to be valuable today. - Yeah, and I took lots of tests also. - Candy, we don't want to hear about your trips to the free clinic. - Girls, could you get me a sample of the Malathion solution, it's in the corner over there. - I'll get it! I can handle this one myself, Candy! - I already have it! - And be careful with it, it's highly toxic. - If you say so. - Thank you. - Next I need-- - [Girls] I'll get it! - Okay, Candy you get me the culture dishes over there and Holly, you get me the bunsen burner. - Good as done! Do you see the culture dishes? - It's probably right under your nose, but you just don't see it! - [Candy] Hey! - Here you go. Are you ready to light my fire? - Pardon me? - Listen Dirk, this chemistry stuff is for kids. Let's get down to some real experimenting. - Somehow I fail to grasp what you're trying to say. (glass shatters) - Here, let me make myself clear. - Be careful, these chemicals are highly volatile when they're incensed. - Yeah, well so am I. - Here's the dish. - Honestly Candy, can't you see we're busy? He was just about to light my fire. - Oh really? Listen Dirk, if anybody's about to get their fire lit, it better be me. I'm the one who volunteered to be your stupid assistant! - If anybody's going to be your stupid assistant, it's going to be me! - Girls, why don't you flip a coin over it? - Fine! - I get tails. - Oh Amanda! - Uh, it's Samantha, Sir. - Could you please mail this for me? It's very important. - Right away, Sir. (quirky music) (whistling) - Keep your mouth shut and you won't get hurt. - We need to talk. - Well I don't have anything to say to you. - From what I understand, you stopped a robbery yesterday. That was money I was going to get a cut out of. - Look, I have my own job now, I don't care what differences we have. - I'm not asking you to leave your job. I like where you are right now. - So what are you saying? - What are they paying you for all this work? - Right now nothing, I'm in this training program. - I don't believe in training programs. How would you like to be working for me and getting paid for it? - I'm not going to quit my job for you! - No one's asking you to quit. I'll pay you to stay on the force. Just overlook any of my crimes that you see. - Forget it, I'm not going to be in the take. - You're a fool, Samantha. - Yeah, you really want to live on minimum wage salary? - Think it over. I'll be in touch. (car revs) (car horn honking) (erotic music) - Excuse us for just a moment. - This better be good. - I finally have it, our one way ticket back on the force. I just saw Samantha outside with Malathion. She's on the take. - What? If you saw Malathion, why didn't you try and catch her? - Candy, you are always thinking so small. Now that we know that Samantha's working on the other side, it'll be easy to get her kicked off the force and get Malathion at the same time. - But Samantha seems so nice. - Candy, this is your biggest problem. You're always looking for the good in people. Why can't you be more like me? - I still think you're wrong. - Fine, then I'll take the credit when I expose her. - Ah, did you mail that letter for me? - Yes I did, Sir. May I ask you a question? - Certainly, what is it? - I was wondering, am I gonna get paid for any of training that I'm doing? - Well I'm sure you understand that there is no pay for the training program. - Yeah, I was afraid of that. Let's say after the training is completed. - Well I suppose we can give you a starting salary. And of course if you show a good enough performance then you'll get a raise in six months. Ms. Devonshire, how long have you been on the force? - 12 years, Sir. 12 of the longest, best, and more rewarding years of my life. - And how much do you get paid? - $4.60 an hour. - Now we can start you at $4.00 an hour. How does that sound? And think of all the incentive someone like Ms. Devonshire could be to you. (growling) You know I like you, Sabrina. I'm gonna give you $5.00 an hour. - $5.00 an hour?! - Be quiet, Ms. Devonshire! How does that sound? And think of all the benefits you get. Do you know that if you get shot in the line of duty, we pay all your hospital bills? And if you happen to get killed in the line of duty, well then you really rake it in. Makes you have to really take a good long look at that future in Vice enforcement. - I just hope you're right about Samantha. - Wait a minute, I still need an assistant. - Oh go play with your beaker! - Attention, a robbery in progress has been spotted at the recycling center at Coanga and Lakerscum. All available officers report at once. The suspects are reported to be armed. - The recycling center! Why those are the people that give us that money for the Field Day competition every year. Do we have any spare officers we can send out? - No Sir, they're all on duty. - Ahh, Candy, Holly, I'm putting you back on active duty as of now. - Thank you, Sir! - You won't regret it. - What about me? - I've got something very important for you to do too, Ms. Devonshire. Get back in my office and start collating my drawers. (bell rings) - Hey, did you hear that? We're back on the force! - Will you give me back my gun? I hope you've had time to clean it. That's not my gun. You know, there's this chrome job I've really been-- - Oh and girls. I'd like you take Samantha along with you, I think the experience will do her some good. Get her an extra gun, alright? Samantha, oh, very good! Good luck, Vice trainee. - Thank you, Sir. (synthesizer music) - Alright, just follow me and do as I say. - Who put you in charge? - Who else would you rather have be in charge? - Alright. - Alright, we'll spread out and try and find them. - Hurry up, we've been in here long enough. - Keep your shirt on, we're almost finished. - You got everything? - Yeah, all cleaned out. - Alright, hold it right there! - It's only Samantha. - Yeah, you scared us! We thought you were a real cop. - Well I am gonna be a real cop and I'm taking you two in with me! - Oh please, didn't you like what Malathion had to offer you? - Are you kidding, that woman's crazy. - No, you're the crazy one. How much you getting paid to be on the force? - $5.00 an hour. (laughing) - You've got to be kidding. - But I bet if I take you two in I'll get a bonus. - You want a bonus? How does this look to you? What do you say? This is more than you'll make in 1 O years on the force. - And this is your cut just for one day's job. - Forget it. I'm taking you two in. - You're a fool, Samantha. Always have been, always will be. - Freeze! You're all under arrest! Look, now they got away! - Hurry, we're almost out of here! (tires screeching) - I can't believe this, I had them! - You know this was all part of your plan to let them get away. - What plan? - Read about it in my report. (laughing) - So you think Samantha helped you get away? - Well she wasn't going to at first. - Yeah, but showing her a wad of bills made her come to her senses. - I thought she'd come around. I'm a woman of my word, see to it she gets her cut. - Will do. - Things should go real smooth with her on the force now. - These are some very serious accusations you've made about Samantha. - Every bit of it's true. Ask her for yourself. Just watch this. - Samantha, have a word with you? - [Samantha] Why certainly, Sir. - I've heard some rather disturbing news, Samantha. I heard that Malathion offered you a bribe to help assist her in her crimes. Is it true? - Well yes, but I didn't-- - Why didn't you tell me, Samantha? - Because I didn't go along with it. I had already caught two members in her group and I almost had the other two. - Ah, but you didn't catch them, you let them get away, huh? - I didn't let them get away! - Sorry it had to end this way. Clean out your locker, Samantha. Effective immediately, you're off the training program officially. - What? - That's right, tomorrow you can go back to prison and live out the remainder of your sentence. Tonight, you can stay in a holding tank. - But, but I didn't do anything! I'm innocent! - And to think, I was going to pay her $5.00 an hour. - What did I tell you? And I did it with one day to spare. - That was really a rotten thing to do. - Oh shut up, I'm not gonna lose my job to some crash course ex con. - Ms. Devonshire, aren't you gonna do anything about this? - Well he was gonna pay her more than I get. - Samantha? I'm really sorry about what happened. If there's anything I can do-- - Don't worry about it, it wasn't your fault. - I did enjoy working with you. - Thanks. I really wanted to have a job waiting for me when I got out of prison. I guess I ruined all my chances of that, huh? - AW, don't think like that. You'll have plenty of opportunities. - Yeah, guess I should just stick to what I know best. - I meant what I said about helping you if you need it. - Really? Thanks. Thanks. "Here's the money I promised you "for helping me out. "Good work! "Melathion." _ We got it! An anti-Melathion formula. - Good work! And not a moment too soon. - I guess having me as a lab assistant really helped. - Yeah, right. - Now all we need is a plan to get her out of hiding, right? Something so tempting, so tempting, that she won't possibly be able to resist. (laughs) - Hello, I'm Ms. Devonshire and this afternoon the police station is sponsoring an Earth Day celebration. Now all refreshments will be served on biodegradable plates and there will be an entertaining lecture on recycling. And all cars are welcomed for a free smog check. Admission to this event is simply the donation of a piece of recyclable material. All proceeds will go to the policemen's pension fund. There will be plenty of food and drink for all and remember, there will be a drawing for a large sum of money. Got that? A large, unguarded, out in the open sum of money. - I can't stand it anymore! Rev up the car, we've got a party to crash! Now let's turn to our community segment, something I like to call Devonshire's Corner. Why we'll address topics of interest to me. Topics like corporal punishment, the death penalty, interrogation techniques. Oh, I'm getting rather excited now. As a matter of fact my first - We're off the air, miss. - Well good work, Ms. Devonshire! Very convincing, huh? I particularly liked the part about the death penalty. - Oh, thank you. - What a great idea! An event for conservation! It's about time. - This is not a real event! It is intended to lure Malathion out of hiding. When she hears this she will not be able to resist showing up and this time we will be ready. - Oh, so we don't really have to bring anything recyclable to get in. - Oh yes you do! I want everything to be as realistic as possible, particularly the part about the drawing of the money. - Just how realistic do you intend to be, Sir? - Well I've got a great idea. What we're gonna is I'm gonna cash all the checks of everybody on the force and I'm gonna use that money as bait! As soon as Malathion sees that money why she's just got to go for it! - What about your paycheck, Sir? - Nah, your paychecks will be plenty. - Our paychecks? And what if she gets away with them? - Well it'll give you a greater incentive to catch her, won't it? (laughs) Come on, Ms. Devonshire, there's work to be done. (celebratory music) - This is the most disgusting group of people I've ever seen. - Ms. Devonshire, be nice. These are our guests. Let's just hope they don't take anything. - Welcome! - We don't burn our bras anymore. We make them into quilts. - Very commendable. - Phew! - Our beamer's the red one. Make sure you have our smog device checked, alright? - What, of course. Now that's what I call recyclable waste. - I cleaned up the parking lot as I collected these cans. - Oh, very good! - Every little bit helps. - I'm afraid that you've missed the whole point, dear. - What did I do? - Honestly Holly, I can't believe you'd wear a fur coat to an event like this. - Yeah, well I just wanted to look my best which is more than I can say for you. - I was cleaning up trash in the parking lot. - Well I suppose someone has to do it. - Hey look, free food! - Of course we only eat vegetarian. - Mmmm, this is delicious. What is it? - Pig's feet. (coughing) - What? Ah ah ah ah, girls, girls, don't touch that food, that's for the guests! - Now here, here's for your cover. Put those on and I'll explain your position after you've changed. - You know, I feel some really bad karma. - Excuse me, Officer. - Yes, Ma'am? - I wonder if you could help me out. I seem to be having trouble distinguishing between aluminum cans and tin cans. Could you come out to my car and help me? - Certainly, Miss. - Thank you! - Hey! (thunk) - Hurry up, we haven't got much time! - Oh Ms. Devonshire, someone threw up on that refreshment table over there. Get that cleaned up, will you? Here, use that. Thank you. Come on! - Excellent cause. - Oh, now look at that! Someone stiffed us with a tin can! - What do you think the Commissioner had in mind when he picked out these outfits? - I don't know. These outfits are fully recyclable. Maybe we're supposed to be the opening act for the show! - That makes sense! We're dressed in theme. - Come on, let's go! (upbeat music) (crowd murmuring) (record scratching) (party music) - Pony! (upbeat music) (record scratching) - Watusi! (upbeat music) - Yeah, it's better than Woodstock. (upbeat music) - Do the swim! - Stop that! Okay, settle down everyone, settle down now. - What in the H-E-double hockey sticks do you two think you're doing? This is supposed to be a family event! - But I thought you wanted us to entertain the audience! - Why would you think I would want you to do a thing like that? What I want you to do is get inside these two bins of recyclable waste! These outfits are gonna conceal you. - What? I'm not getting inside of a trash can. - Look look look, see, that's the money that we're using as bait, right? Now this is as close as I can get you to the money and still keep you hidden. Now we want to get the jump on Malathion, don't we? Come on. - Alright. - Good work, good work. - This is the most disgusting thing I've ever done on duty. - Of course, you won't want to forget your guns either. Here you go. - [Girls] Ow! - Sorry. I can still see you. Here we go, how's that. There, oh this is perfect! Now don't move and don't say a word. - [Candy] Oh no, I think I have an itch. - Fine, that's better. Now the right. Phew, ready Sir? - All set. - Welcome to our little Earth Day celebration. Now is everybody having fun? (booing) Hey, oh, now we don't want to get ugly here. (ominous music) I'm Ms. Devonshire, your hostess for this afternoon. Let's get down to business. Do you recycle? - [Crowd] Yeah! Yes, yeah! - Do you care about the deterioration of the Ozone layer? - [Crowd] Yes! - Do you care about the quality of the air that you breathe? - [Crowd] Yeah! (coughing) ' Yes! - Do you care about the water that you drink? - [Crowd] Yeah! Yes! Yeah! - Do you care to tell us what is going on back there? (hushing) - Ms. Devonshire, this woman over here is smoking cigarettes, she's using hairspray, and she's drinking out of a Styrofoam cup! (gasps) - Young woman! What do you have to say for yourself? (dramatic music) (laughing) - Holy moley! - Malathion! - Officer, arrest that woman! - I don't think so. I don't work for you guys. - He's just kidding, right? - Alright! Everybody hand over your valuables and don't try anything funny. You first, big mouth! - I was gonna use that money to buy a low flow shower head! - Shut up! - Let's hustle, come on come on come on. And I'm keeping my eye on you two! - Alright everybody on the floor! (gunshot blasting) Like a job well done. (screaming) - Run, everybody, run! (panicked music) - [Audience Member] This way! - That's our cue, right on schedule. - Hey, would you look at that? - Like taking candy from a baby! (laughing) - Look at these bins over here. - So, it's just plastic. - Yeah, but feel how heavy they are. At 45 cents a pound, there's a lot of money in here. - You have a point. Help me with the money, we'll come back for the rest later. - Alright. - Okay. - [Girls] Freeze! (laughing) - Alright, get away from there! - What are you gonna stop us with? - Wait, I know my gun is in here somewhere. - Get 'em! (screaming) (upbeat music) - Get away from there! - Where is my gun? - Alright, so my bin's heavy, huh? (upbeat music) - Devonshire! Where are you, Devonshire? - Hold it right there! - What are you supposed to be? - I'm your exterminator. - You've got to be kidding. (screaming) You're not kidding. - Any last words? - Dodd, run, take the money and split! - Ms. Devonshire, very good! - Thank you, Sir. - Samantha, what are you doing here? - Sir, I need to speak to you. Malathion offered me this bribery money. I was very tempted to keep it, but something inside me just wouldn't. - Well you're very honest, Samantha. - You're very stupid! I would have kept it. - Well I guess that's where we're different, Melanie. Here's a dime. You're gonna need it where you're going. - And look what we got! - Well, very good, girls, very good! Looks like we caught Malathion and her whole gang, didn't we? Well we've cleaned up the city. Once again we'll have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink and a clean recycling center. - Just can it already! - Yeah, most importantly our paycheck money is safe and sound. - Samantha, I didn't expect to see you here! - She helped us capture one of Malathion's gang. - Good work, I always knew you were on our side. - Thanks, Candy. At least somebody believed me. - Samantha, perhaps I judged you wrongly, but you know what? I'm gonna give you another chance. You've got two months left in your sentence, huh? Well I want you to take those two months and I want you to study as hard as you can and if you pass that entrance exam, well then we'll put you back on the force, now what do you say to that? Vice trainee, hmm? - Yes Sir, I'll do my best, Sir! - You won't regret this. - Congratulations. - Now, get these losers out of here. - Come on! There's a suite at The Gray Bar Hotel waiting for you. - No, I think you should take them to jail, Ms. Devonshire. - Yes, Sir. - No cell could hold me! No prison is large enough to keep me behind bars! No force could-- - Hey, you may have already flushed your life down the toilet, but I am trying to study here! So either you put a cork in it, or I'm gonna shove my fist so far down your throat it'll never see daylight again, you got it?! - Yes, ma'am, I'll be quiet. - So shut up! (ticking clock music) - Well congratulations, you made it, Officer! - I did, I really did? I can't believe it, I can't believe it! I really did? - I knew you could do it! - Thanks. I can't believe it. - Yeah, me too. - Commissioner, how about putting me back on active duty now? - Well I suppose so, Ms. Devonshire. - At $5.00 an hour? - What? - It's not unreasonable. - Ms. Devonshire, $5.00 an hour, I don't know. - Alright, you can keep me at $4.60, but you will never ever figure out your filing system after what I have done to it, Sir. - Oh, well I see your point, Ms. Devonshire. Very well, $5.00 an hour. - Thank you, Sir. And remember, I'm worth it. - How well I know, Ms. Devonshire. Tell me, what are you gonna do with all that money now that you got a raise, huh? - Well I have one plan. You don't happen to have the number of a good tattoo remover? (upbeat music)
