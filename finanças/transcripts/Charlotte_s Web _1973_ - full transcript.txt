23.976 English SDH DVD Subrip NTSC ? 25.04.2020 Charlotte's Web This old world is filled with wonders, but to me there's no place more wonderful than a farm in springtime, when the sun is just lifting on the skyline. The air is so sweet, and everywhere you look, little miracles are happening. Buds swell into blossoms, eggs hatch, young are born. Everything's off to a fresh start, and life is good and busy and brand-new. Around the barnyard, big families are a blessing. The more, the merrier. Root and grunt, push and shove, room for everybody. Well, everybody except the runt. John Arabel had been up since daybreak. He'd seen the pig's size, and he wasn't looking forward to what had to be done. Good morning, Papa. Morning, Fern. Here are the eggs, Mama. Thank you, Fern. What's Papa doing with that ax? Some pigs were born last night. Why does he need an ax? One pig was a runt. Your father has to do away with it. Do away with it? You mean kill it? Well, yes. Because it's smaller than the others? The pig would probably die anyway. Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Stop! Don't! Don't kill it! It's unfair! Fern, you will have to learn to control yourself. Control myself? This is a matter of life and death, and you say control yourself. I know more about raising pigs than you. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along. But it's unfair. If I had been very small, would you have killed me? Oh, certainly not. A little girl is one thing. A runty pig is another. I don't see any difference. This is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of. I've got a mind to let you raise this pig. Then you'd see what trouble a pig can be. Oh, Papa. Would you? Please? All right. He's yours. Saved from an untimely death. Oh. Look at him. He's absolutely perfect. His name is... Wilbur. A pig doesn't grow fat on kisses and hugs. Now take him inside and feed him. John Arabel, you've gone soft. Isn't he precious? Can I have one, too? I only distribute pigs to early risers. Fern was up at daylight, fighting injustice. Seems you've already got more wildlife than you can take care of, Avery. ? There must be something more to us ? ? Than you and me ? ? It must be tangled up somehow ? ? With destiny ? ? I used to think the sum of 1 and 1 ? ? Was 2 ? ? But we add up to more, me and you ? ? When we are close together ? ? It's so plain to see ? ? Together we are better than we used to be ? ? I don't know how to say the things I'm thinking of ? ? But the something-more I'm feeling ? ? Must be love ? ? I used to think the sum of 1 and 1 was 2 ? ? But we add up to more, me and you ? ? I don't know how to say the things I'm thinking of ? ? But the something-more I'm feeling ? ? Must be love ? But to a boy named Henry Fussy, fun was something he'd only heard about. Henry. Where did you get the pig? Papa gave him to me because he was the R-U-N-T. Let me hold him. You know, Henry, you ought to have a dog or something. Well, Mother says pets are unsanitary. Wilbur's not. He's clean as a whistle. Henry Fussy, you put that thing down! Shoo! Shoo! Get out! Shoo! Shoo! All right, Wilbur. Make a wish. This pig now sits at the table like family? It's Wilbur's birthday, Papa. He's 2 weeks old. It's time for him to start behaving like a pig. Tonight he starts sleeping outside. But-- But, Papa-- Don't "But, Papa" me. Take that pig outside where it belongs. It's my old comfy blanket, when I was little. You'll be nice and warm. Go on in. Try it. Good night, Wilbur. I'll see you in the morning. You'll be just fine. Go to sleep now. Oh, Wilbur. ? There must be something more to us ? ? Than you and me ? John, wake up! Robbers! H-Huh? Help, Papa! There's a ghost in my bed! Wilbur was what farmers call a spring pig, meaning he was born in springtime. When he was 6 weeks old, he'd grown so, you'd never have known he started life as a runt. Wilbur had gotten so big, in fact, that John Arabel decided it was time he stopped being a pet and started being a pig. He's got to go, Fern. Papa, no! You've had your fun raising a baby pig, but Wilbur's got to be sold. He's not a baby anymore, and his brothers and sisters are already sold. Oh, Papa. What's the matter with Fern? Fern's learning the hard facts of farm life. Oh, Wilbur. The next day was the saddest one Fern and Wilbur had ever known. The young pig was taken from his home under the apple tree and sold down the road to Fern's uncle Homer Zuckerman. Good-bye, Wilbur. Good-bye, Wilbur! Good-bye. Sorry, sonny, sorry. I'm sitting, sitting on my eggs, but if you'd like to come here and talk, you're welcome, welcome, welcome. Can't you talk, talk, talk? You probably--obably could if you tried. Try, try, try. W-W-W-W... W-W-W-W... Oh, you can do better, better, better than that. W-W-W-Wilbur! Very good. Very good! W-W-Wilbur! Wilbur! There, there, there. You speak very well. I can talk. I can talk! ? I can actually, factually talk ? ? Isn't it great ? ? That I articulate? ? ? Isn't it grand ? ? That you can understand? ? ? I don't grunt, I don't oink ? ? I don't even squeak or squawk ? ? When I wanna say a something ? ? I open up and talk ? ? I can talk ? ? I can talk, talk, talk ? ? I can talk ? ? I pop with perspicacity ? ? I'm loaded with loquacity ? ? My vocalized veracity is tops ? ? Semantically each bit of me's ? ? The verbalized epitome ? ? My plethory of patter never stops ? ? Isn't it great ? ? That I articulate? ? ? Isn't it grand ? ? That you can understand? ? ? I don't whock, I don't wheek ? ? I don't even squeak or squawk ? ? When I wanna say a something ? ? I open up and talk ? ? I can talk ? ? I can talk, talk, talk ? ? I can talk ? ? It's wondrous and mystical ? ? I'm hardly egotistical ? ? Because of this linguistical aplomb ? ? But speaking quite pragmatically ? ? My self-esteem emphatically ? ? Dramatically improved since I was dumb ? ? Isn't it great ? ? That I articulate? ? ? Isn't it grand ? ? That you can understand? ? ? I don't honk, I don't eek ? ? I don't even squeak or squawk ? ? When I wanna say a something ? ? I open up and talk ? ? I can talk ? ? I can talk, talk, talk ? ? I can... ? Why don't you keep it down? ? I can talk ? Now, aren't you glad, glad, glad? No. I'm still sad, sad, sad. I miss Fern. Sooey! Sooey! Pig, pig, pig, pig! Here, pig! Hmm. Something's wrong with that new pig, Homer. He won't touch his slops. Probably needs a spring tonic. Give him some sulfured molasses. All right. Here, pig! Here you go, Wilbur. Take this. There you go. Ooh--ooh--ooh. Ooh, ooh. Hey! This pig is a fainter. You have a good home, home here. Why aren't you happy, happy, happy? I miss Fern. Hmm. You're quite a pig. It felt good to hear a word of praise, but what he really wanted was a friend. Better eat, Wilbur. I don't want food. I want a friend. Will you play with me? I'm no flibberty--ibberty jibbit. I'm staying here and hatching my goslings. Will you play with me, Templeton? Play? I hardly know the meaning of the word. It means to run and skip and make merry. I never do any of those things... if I can avoid them. I prefer to spend my time spying... And hiding, and, uh... eating. Help yourself. I'm not hungry. Want to play? May I, Papa? Certainly not. In the first place, you can't get out of your pen. In the second place, sheep do not play with pigs. Why not? It's a matter of status. Sheep, for instance, are highly regarded by Zuckerman because we furnish him with good quality wool. With pigs, it's just a matter of time. Time till what? Till you're fat enough to kill. What did you say? Oh, everybody knows it. In the fall you'll be turned into smoked bacon and ham. Just as soon as cold weather sets in, they'll kill you. Oh! Templeton! Hmm? Templeton, would you do something--omething-- omething about Wilbur, please? Ow! Is it true what the old sheep says? Is that awful thing true? It's a dirty--irty trick, but it's true. I don't want to die. I want to stay here in my warm manure pile and breathe the beautiful air and lie in the beautiful sun. You're certainly making a beautiful noise. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Quiet, Wilbur. Now, chin up. Who said that? Do you want a friend? Yes, I want a friend, but I want to live, too. Well, chin up. I'll be your friend, and I'll try to save your life. I've been watching you, and I like you. I can't see you. What do you mean, chin up? Now go to sleep. You'll see me in the morning, and I'll explain everything then. Wilbur's stomach was empty, and his mind was full. When your stomach is empty and your mind is full, it's always hard to sleep, but sleep and Wilbur finally found each other. ? Chin up, chin up ? ? Everybody loves a happy face ? ? Wear it ? ? Share it ? ? It'll brighten up the darkest place ? ? Twinkle ? ? Sparkle ? ? Let a little sunshine in ? ? You'll be on the right side ? ? Looking at the bright side ? ? Up with your chinny chin chin... ? Ahem! Attention, please. Will the party who addressed me last night kindly come out of hiding? If you do have a friend, you're probably disturbing his rest. Oh. I beg everyone's pardon. I didn't mean to be objectionable. ? Chin up, chin up ? ? Put a little laughter in your eyes ? ? Brave it, save it ? ? Even though you're feeling otherwise ? ? Rise up, wise up ? ? Make a little smile begin ? ? You'll be happy-hearted ? ? Once you get started ? ? Up with your chinny chin chin ? Salutations. Huh? Salu what? Salutations. What are they? And where are you? Salutations are greetings. It's my fancy way of saying hello. Look up here in the doorway. ? Chin down ? ? You can't come frowning ? ? Turn around ? ? Starting clowning ? ? Think sad ? ? Your troubles double ? ? Think glad ? ? To burst white bubbles ? ? Chin up, chin up ? ? Every little time your spirits wilt ? ? Chin up, chin up ? ? Give your attitude an upward tilt ? ? Twinkle ? ? Sparkle ? ? Make a little fun begin ? ? You'll be on the right side ? ? Looking at the bright side ? ? Up with your chinny chin ? ? Chin up ? See me now? Oh, yes! Good morning! Salutations. I can't see you well, though. Is that better? Oh, yes. I promised I'd tell you all about the words chin up, and I did. What is your name, please? My name is Charlotte, Charlotte A. Cavatica. I think you're beautiful. Well, I am pretty. Almost all spiders are nice-looking. I'm not as flashy as some, but I'll do. About saving my life, do you really think you can? Oh, just a minute, Wilbur. He'll make a perfect breakfast for me. Eww. You mean you eat flies? Well, certainly. I eat anything that gets caught in my web. I have to live, don't I? Why, yes, of course. Do they taste good? Delicious. Yecchh! I don't really eat them. I drink their blood. I love blood. Oh, please don't say that. Why not? It's true. But it's cruel. Well, you can't talk. You have your meals brought to you in a pail. Nobody feeds me. I live by my wits. It just seems an odd diet. Do you realize if I didn't eat them, bugs would get so numerous, they'd destroy the earth? Spiders are really very useful creatures. I wish I were useful. Maybe I'll spin a web. Let's see you do it. How do I start? Take a deep breath. Now climb to the highest place you can get to. Oh! What did I do wrong? Ha ha ha! Nothing. It was a nice try. I know what I need. You there, Templeton? Mm-hmm? Got a little piece of string I could borrow? I need it to spin a web. What's in it for me? I'll save you part of my breakfast. You've got yourself a deal. Tie one end to my tail, will you? No trouble at all. Now attach the other end up there to that rafter. Everybody, watch. Oh. I'm going to try that again. I advise you to put the idea out of your mind. You lack a set of spinnerets, and you lack know-how. But chin up. Why should you worry about trapping food? I'm glad you're here, Charlotte. Will you stay for a long, long time? A spider's life is an uncertain thing, but I'll stay as long as I can. Eww. If it bothers you so, Wilbur, I'll eat it after you're asleep. Thank you, Charlotte. You're very considerate. The early summer days on a farm are the fairest and happiest of the year, and Wilbur looked forward each day to a visit from Fern. All the animals trusted her because she was quiet and friendly. And it made Fern happy just to be near them. I am sure everyone will be gratified to learn that after 4 weeks of unremitting effort and patience on the part of the goose, the goslings have arrived. Congratulations! How many are there? There are 7. 7 is a lucky number. Luck had nothing to do with this. It was good management and hard work. Why didn't, uh... this one hatch? It's a dud, I guess. What will you do with it? You can have it. Roll it away. Add it to that nasty collection of yours. Be careful. A rotten egg can be a regular stink bomb. I know what I'm doing. I handle stuff like this all the time. Let me see your family. I've never seen goslings before. Come along, Jeffrey. Ooh! It's big out here. It is big, and it is frightening at times, but on the whole, the world is a wonderful place. This one's undersized. That's Jeffrey. He takes after my side of the family--amily. I never saw a gosling that tiny. There must be something wrong with him. Oh! Are you my mother? No, I'm Wilbur. I'm not your mother, but I'll be your friend. I was a runt like you once. You're kidding. No, I'm not. Then I want to be like you. Well, why not? ? Oh, we've got ? ? Lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? Where it really counts ? ? We've got large amounts ? ? What we look like ? ? Doesn't count an ounce ? ? We've got lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? You've got feathers, I've got skin ? ? But both our outsides hold us in ? ? I've got hooves ? ? You've got webbed feet ? ? But we both stand up to eat ? ? 'Cause we've got ? ? Lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? Where it really counts ? ? We've got large amounts ? ? What we look like ? ? Doesn't count an ounce ? ? We've got lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? You've got a beak ? ? And I've a snout ? ? But the both of us can sniff about ? ? You'll say quack ? ? And I'll say neigh ? ? But we're talking either way ? ? 'Cause we've got ? ? Lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? Where it really counts ? ? We've got large amounts ? ? What we look like ? ? Doesn't count an ounce ? ? We've got lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? You're born to swim ? ? And me to spin ? ? But we both love this world we're in ? ? We share the sun, the earth, the sky ? ? And that's the reason why ? ? We've all got ? ? Lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? ? Where it really counts ? ? We've got large amounts ? ? What we look like ? ? Doesn't count an ounce ? ? We've got lots in common ? ? Where it really counts ? Come along, Jeffrey-- effrey. It's time for swimming lessons. You want to go? I'd love to go swimming with you, but I don't swim. Well, I'll stay with Wilbur, Mom. Suit yourself. Let's be friends forever, Wilbur. Want to? Jeffrey, there's a horrible fact of life that you don't know about yet, and I don't want to tell you, but Charlotte's working on the problem. Aren't you, Charlotte? Indeed, yes. But I see no point in withholding unpleasant information from your friend. The fact is, Jeffrey, Wilbur's life is in danger. I'm trying to save him. Can I help? We'll see. First, I have to think of an idea. I love you, Wilbur. I love you, too, Jeffrey. Papa, did you know that Uncle Homer's goslings hatched? Oh, how many? 7. There were 8 eggs, but one didn't hatch. The goose told Templeton he could have it. The goose did what? Told Templeton she didn't want the egg anymore. Who's Templeton? A rat. None of us like him much. Who's us? Oh, everybody in the barn cellar-- Wilbur and the sheep and the lambs and goose and Charlotte and me. Charlotte? Who's Charlotte? Wilbur's friend. Oh, she's terribly clever. What does she look like? Well, she has 8 legs and catches flies so she can drink their blood. Wilbur adores her. Fern, stop inventing these wild tales. Oh, I'm not inventing. I'm just telling the facts. Darling, I want you to play outside today instead of visiting Uncle Homer's barn. But I like it over there. You're spending too much time there. You shouldn't be alone so much. But I'm not alone. My best friends are in the barn cellar. It's not at all lonely. Once she had promised Wilbur she was going to save his life, Charlotte was determined to keep her promise. Day after day, she hung from her web and waited patiently for an idea to come to her. How perfectly simple. What's that, Charlotte? I'll save your life by tricking Zuckerman. It won't hurt him? Trust me, Wilbur. People are very gullible. They'll believe anything they see in print. Why isn't that gosling with his mother? Because he likes Wilbur. Shrimpy little thing. Sounds more like a pig than a gosling. Wow! Look at that big spider! I'll catch it for my collection. Avery, you leave that spider alone! I'm going to catch him. What's wrong with you, Wilbur? He doesn't like you in there. Get out. What did you do, Avery? Ew! Good night! What a stink! It's a good thing for you I saved that egg. It certainly is. I'm grateful to you, Templeton. This business is well and good for Charlotte. But what about us? Who wants to live in a barn that's perfumed with rotten eggs? It will clear soon. See? The breeze is already taking it away. Afternoon passed and evening came. Shadows lengthened across the farm, and the cool, sweet breath of evening flowed in. Charlotte? Yes, Wilbur. Are you thinking about how you'll save my life? Chin up. Just stop worrying. I don't want to die, Charlotte. I love it here in the barn. Of course you do. We all do. How will you save me, Charlotte? Now, go to sleep. You'll see me in the morning. I'll try. Get some sleep, Wilbur. ? Now is the hour ? ? When frogs and thrushes ? ? Praise the world ? ? From the woods and rushes ? ? Sleep, my love ? ? Sleep, my only dear ? ? In the dark ? ? Fragile and magical shadows ? ? Silently start to appear ? ? Lovely and lyrical silvery miracle ? ? Charlotte's web ? ? Carefully spinning her tracings ? ? Lacy and gracefully sheer ? ? Over and under, the infinite wonder ? ? Of Charlotte's web ? ? Why is she spinning and weaving away ? ? All night long? ? ? What is she trying so hard to convey ? ? With her silent song? ? What are you doing? Working. Why so late? I'll be lucky if I'm finished by sunup. Go to sleep, Templeton. Good night, Charlotte. Good night, Templeton. ? Sometimes when somebody loves you ? ? Miracles somehow appear ? ? And there in the warp and the woof ? ? Is the proof of it ? ? Charlotte's web ? I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm seeing things! Mr. Zuckerman! Mr. Zuckerman! Something's happened to Lervy. Do you see what I see? "Some pig." You don't suppose that spider... Edith, we have received a sign. We have a very unusual pig. Seems to me you're a little off. Seems to me we have no ordinary spider. No, it's just a common gray spider. See? It's sitting right there. It's a miracle! We must share this with our friends. "Some pig." That's what it says, all right. Pig! Some pig, look this way! Getting to be famous didn't change Wilbur one bit. Through all the crowds and publicity and glamour, he stayed the same old Wilbur. He was glad when the crowds stopped coming, and he could be with his real friends again. Even Mrs. Fussy fell for the message in the web and let Henry come over to see the famous pig. A Hornet! Duck! Ohh! It's all right, Wilbur. Everybody knows you're some pig. Henry, I said you could visit, not spend the day. I'm sorry. We were having fun. You've kept your music teacher waiting 20 minutes. Run along home. Those words in the web, was that some trick of yours? No, ma'am! It was a miracle! Hmm. It doesn't look very miraculous anymore. Charlotte, if people start doubting the miracle, you think my life will still be saved? Most definitely not. I hate to keep bothering you. You're no bother to me. You are my one true friend. Attention, everybody. May I have your attention, please? Templeton, you, too. Sorry, I'm busy. I called this meeting because I'm concerned about Wilbur's safety. I need another message. If anybody thinks of one, I'll weave it into the web. How about "Wilbur's nice?" Well, he is nice, but I need something a little more exciting. How about "pig supreme?" Hmm. No good. It sounds like a rich dessert. How about "terrific, terrific, terrific?" Cut that down to one "terrific," and it might do nicely. I think "terrific" will impress Zuckerman. But Charlotte, I'm not terrific. You're terrific as far as I'm concerned. Does anybody know how to spell it? I think it's T, double E, double R, double R, double I, double F, double I, double C, C, C. What kind of an acrobat do you think I am? It would take all night to write that. I wouldn't consult geese in matters of spelling. The word is spelled T-E-R-R-I-F-I-C. I still think it's prettier spelled T, double E, double R, double I, double-- Please. Let me spell it my way. Why not try by the fence? Huh? Lervy dropped half a sandwich there. Why, thank you, Charlotte. Eek! That wasn't nice, Charlotte! Perhaps the next time I call a meeting, you'll see fit to attend. Sooey! Pig, pig, pig! Here, pig! ? Dee dee dee dee dee ? Mr. Zuckerman! Another miracle! Right, this morning. "Terrific." Plain as anything. Another miracle at Zuckerman's. People who had come to see Wilbur when he was "some pig" came back again now that he was "terrific." That's some pig. Yeah, some terrific pig. He's terrific! Wow! I never saw a pig like that! But gradually, the crowds got to be smaller and smaller. And finally, people stopped coming altogether. Here, pig! Sooey! That's some pig. He's terrific. He's a wonderful pig. You'll get some extra-good ham and bacon when it comes time to kill that pig. Ohh... Charlotte! Look at Wilbur! Oh, Templeton, please. Would you revive Wilbur, please? Yow! They're going to kill me. I don't want to die. Wilbur, now calm down. I can't stand hysterics. But I want to live! And live you shall. Templeton, would you please stay? There's going to be a meeting. I'm going back to bed. There's been a new threat to Wilbur's life. You can help us. Why should I worry about Wilbur? You'll worry when winter comes. If Wilbur is killed, and his trough stands empty, you'll grow so thin, we'll look right through your stomach and see objects on the other side. What exactly did you have in mind, Charlotte? I need new ideas for the web. Go to the dump and bring back a magazine clipping. Right after I finish my nap. No, Templeton. There is not a second to spare. Aw! It says "crunchy." No, that's wrong. It might start Zuckerman thinking about crunchy bacon. Ohh! Wilbur, I forbid you to faint. Templeton, I'll have to ask you to try again. What do you think I am, a messenger boy? Now, Templeton, please. Well, I know where there's a package of soap flakes with writing on it. I'll bring you a piece. "With new radiant action." What does it mean? How should I know? I suppose the next thing you'll want me to fetch is a dictionary. "With new radiant action." Wilbur, run around. I want to see if you're radiant in action. Jump in the air. Do a back flip with a half-twist in it. I'm not sure that's radiant action, but it's interesting. Actually, I feel radiant. Then radiant you shall be. Thank you, Templeton. You've been most helpful. How's that for a pig? That pig is radiant! Never seen nothing like it. That's some pig. That's a pig that'll win prizes! - Yeah! - Ha ha ha! Oh, fine swine! Wish he was mine! Friends! I don't want my radiant pig all worn out. You can see him again because I've decided to take him to the County Fair. - Yay! - Yay! Lervy! Yes, sir. Make a large crate. Paint it green with bold letters. What should the letters say? They should say, "Zuckerman's famous pig." Yes, sir! What do you do at a fair, Wilbur? Well, you win a prize, if you're the biggest and the best. You think we'll win? I hope so. He has to win. It's the only way he can save his life. Pay no attention to him, Wilbur. Charlotte, I've just got to win a prize at the fair. Don't worry, Wilbur. It's character that counts, and you have a very good character. You're going with me, aren't you, Charlotte? Well, I don't know. The fair comes at a bad time for me. I can't stand going to the fair without you. You've got to come. I really ought to stay home and see if I can get some work done. Let it go. What's come over you? I just can't stand any more violence. I could have used that nourishment. The time has come for me to make an egg sac and fill it with eggs. I didn't know you could lay eggs. Oh, yes. I'm versatile. Does versatile mean full of eggs? Certainly not. Versatile means I turn with ease from one thing to another. Why not come to the fairgrounds and lay your eggs there? Oh, Wilbur. You don't know the first thing about egg-laying. When I get ready to lay eggs, I have to lay eggs, fair or no fair. Let's leave it this way. I'll come to the fair if I can. There's so much to do and so little time. ? How very special are we ? ? For just a moment to be ? ? Part of life's eternal rhyme ? ? How very special are we ? ? To have on our family tree ? ? Mother Earth ? ? And Father Time ? ? He turns the seasons around ? ? And so she changes her gown ? ? But they always look ? ? In their prime ? ? They go on dancing their dance ? ? Of everlasting romance ? ? Mother Earth ? ? And Father Time ? ? The summer larks return to sing ? ? Oh, what a gift they give ? ? Then autumn days grow short and cold ? ? Oh, what a joy to live ? ? How very special are we ? ? For just a moment to be ? ? Part of life's eternal rhyme ? ? How very special are we ? ? To have on our family tree ? ? Mother Earth ? ? And Father Time ? Indian summer came, and the morning of the fair dawned hot. Lervy rushed about and did his chores in half the time it usually took. Homer Zuckerman rushed through breakfast, but in the midst of all the hullabaloo, Mrs. Zuckerman stayed calm. Homer... I'm going to give that pig a buttermilk bath. A what? My grandmother bathed her pig with buttermilk when it got dirty. Wilbur's not dirty. Oh, he's filthy. I'm cleaning him with buttermilk. Edith, you're crazy. Edith, I've got to hand it to you. That pig looks 100 % better. You just wait till he's dry. That's a pig that'll win prizes. Buttermilk will do it every time. Now let's get dressed and go to the fair. Oh. I'll go with you, Wilbur. It's inconvenient, but... but somebody has to go along who knows how to write. Thank you, Charlotte. Come on, Mama! Here we go! Hurry up! Where in the world do you think you're going--oing--oing? To the fair! Oh, no, you're not. Get out. Shoo! Go on. Out! Out! Out! Templeton? Templeton, may I have a word with you? Yes? I think you'd better come, too, Templeton. I might need somebody to run errands and do general work. I'm staying right here. I haven't the slightest interest in fairs. That's because you've never been to one. You can creep out late at night and find a fantastic banquet. ? A fair is a veritable smorgasbord ? ? Orgasbord, orgasbord ? ? After the crowds have ceased ? ? Each night when the lights go out ? ? It can be found ? ? On the ground all around ? ? Oh, what a ratly feast ? Why, a fair has enough disgusting left-over food to satisfy a whole army of rats. Is this true? Is this appetizing yarn of yours true? ? Will I find melon rinds ? ? And bits of hot dogs ? ? Cookie crumbs and rotten cotton candy ? ? Melted ice cream, mustard dripplings ? ? Moldy goodies everywhere ? ? Yes, yes ? ? Lots of popcorn ? ? Apple cores, banana peels ? ? And soggy sandwiches ? ? And gobs of gorgeous gook ? ? To gobble at the fair ? ? Yes, yes, yes ? I like high living. What you say tempts me. It's true. Go to the fair, Templeton. You'll find that it will surpass your wildest dreams. You mean tin cans with particles of tuna fish sticking to them? Greasy paper bags stuffed with rotten eggs? Yep, yep, yep. True, true, true. That's enough. Don't tell me any more. I'm going. ? A fair is a veritable smorgasbord ? ? Orgasbord, orgasbord ? ? After the gates are shut ? ? Each night when the lights go out ? ? It can be found on the ground all around ? ? That's where a rat ? ? Can glut, glut, glut, glut ? Hurry, Templeton. There's no time to be lost. Get into the crate and hide yourself well. Can you see me? Pull in your tail. Charlotte, where will you be? I want you where I can see you. I've got to be where nobody can see me. Listen to me. When they open the crate to put you in, struggle. Pigs always resist when they're being loaded. If I struggle, I'll get dirty. Never mind that. If you were to walk into the crate without resisting, Zuckerman would think there's something wrong with you. Struggle if you must, but kindly remember, I'm hiding down here, and I don't want to be stepped on or kicked in the face or crushed or bruised or lacerated or scarred or biffed. Just watch what you're doing when they're shoving you in... Mr. Radiant. What a cargo. That sign ought to say, "Zuckerman's famous pig and 2 stowaways." There he is. That's some pig. He's terrific. He's radiant. Well, he's clean anyway. That buttermilk certainly helped. Now, if we can just get him into that crate. Come on, Rover. In here. Avery, you get out of that crate this minute. What do you think you are? I'm a pig. Oink, oink, oink. Well, look here. This little gander thinks he's going to the fair, too. Hold this rascal till we get down the road. Exhibitor? You betcha. Zuckerman's famous pig. I hear he's some pig. He's terrific. Livestock section to the right. That's Zuckerman's famous pig. - Ooh. - Ooh. Let's get this pig in the shade. Well, the judging isn't till tomorrow. We might as well see the sights. Can I have some money? I'm going to get a frozen custard, a cheeseburger, and some raspberry soda pop. Now don't get lost. And don't get dirty. Watch out for pickpockets. I promise! Fern, aren't you going with Avery? I'll stay with Wilbur a while, till he feels at home. We're going to look at deep freezers and tractors. We'll meet you here when it gets dark. Yes, Papa. ? There must be something more to us ? ? Than you and me ? ? Hmm hmm hmm hmm ? ? Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm-- ? Hi, Fern. I'm Henry. Henry Fussy? Where have you been? Went to see my grandpa. Know what he did? Accidentally stepped on my violin and broke it to smithereens. He sounds nice. Yeah. We went fishing everyday, and we got dirty and took baths in the creek by this old place he lives in. We camped out in a tent on the top of this mountain. I really had a time. Well, I'm mad with you. You didn't even tell me you were going away. Don't be mad, Fern. Heard Zuckerman's famous pig's here. I came looking for you. Well, I'm not Zuckerman's famous pig. Oh, come on, Fern. I've got some money and I came to ask you if you'd like to ride on the Ferris wheel. Gee. I'd love to. ? The something-more I'm feeling ? ? Must be-- ? Charlotte? She didn't even say, "Good-bye, Wilbur." How do you like that? I like it just fine. I thought Fern loved me. She does, and she always will, but Fern's changed. She's growing up. She's suddenly seeing Henry Fussy with new eyes. Nothing terrific about him. He's not even radiant. He is to Fern. Ahh. Hey! What's going on out there? Is it safe to venture out yet? I'd wait until dark, Templeton. I'm starved. Wh-Where are you going? I want to see the lay of the land. What's it look like from up there? There's a pig in the next pen. He's enormous. I'll have a closer look. May I have your name? No name. Just call me Uncle. Are you a spring pig? Sure. What did you think I was, a spring chicken? That's a good one, huh, sister? I've heard funnier ones. Glad to have met you. I must be going. What's he like? He claims he's a spring pig, but he's not as attractive as you are. He's going to be a hard pig to beat, though, but with me helping you, it can be done. When are you going to spin a web? This afternoon. Late. If I'm not too tired. What will it say? That depends on Templeton. As soon as it's dark, I'll send him to find a word. I'm warning you, Charlotte. I'm not going to spend all my time running errands. You'll do exactly as I tell you, Templeton, because if Wilbur dies, then you'll die-- of starvation. What kind of word would you like, Charlotte? A good one, Templeton. A very good one, since I'll be writing tonight for the last time. What does that mean? Nothing for you to worry about right now, Wilbur. I've got to have a nap so I'll be fresh for work tonight. Let's all take a nap. All afternoon, the pig, the rat, and the spider rested, while on the midway, the Zuckermans and the Arabels found something to interest them. Oh! When darkness came, Charlotte sent Templeton out on his mission. Her web was almost finished when he returned carrying the newspaper clipping. What does it say? It says "humble". Humble. Humble has two meanings. It means not proud, and it also means near the ground. That's Wilbur all over. I hope you're satisfied. I came to this fair to enjoy myself, not to deliver papers. You've been very helpful, Templeton. Thank you. Nobody's going to get any sleep around here tonight. Try, Wilbur. I want you looking your best for the judging tomorrow. Will you sing me a song? Not tonight, Wilbur. What are you doing up there, Charlotte? Oh... making something, as usual. Please tell me what it is. I'll tell you in the morning, when the first light comes into the sky and the sparrows stir and the cows rattle their chains, when the rooster crows and the stars fade, you'll look up here, and I'll show you my masterpiece. The goose was right. This fair is a rat's paradise. Bye-bye, my humble Wilbur. Fare-thee-well, Charlotte, you old schemer. This will be a night to remember! ? A fair is a veritable smorgasbord ? ? Orgasbord, orgasbord ? ? After the crowd's have ceased ? ? Each night when the lights go out ? ? It can be found on the ground all around ? ? Oh, what a ratly feast ? ? Melon rinds and bits of hot dogs ? ? Cookie crumbs and ? ? Rotten cotton candy ? ? Melted ice cream, mustard dripplings ? ? Moldy goodies everywhere ? ? Lots of popcorn ? ? Apple cores, banana peels and ? ? Soggy sandwiches ? ? And gobs of gorgeous gook ? ? To gobble at the fair ? ? A fair ? ? Is a veritable smorgasbord ? ? Orgasbord ? ? Orgasbord ? ? After the gates ? ? Are shut ? ? Each night ? ? When the lights go out ? ? It can be found ? ? On the ground ? All around! ? That's ? ? Where a rat ? ? Can glut ? ? Glut ? ? Glut ? ? Glut ? Next morning, when the first light came into the sky, Wilbur woke and looked for Charlotte. He saw her up overhead in a corner near the back of his pen. Are you awake, Charlotte? Yes. What is that nifty little thing? Did you make it? I did indeed. It's my egg sac. My magnum opus. I don't know what a magnum opus is. That's Latin. It means "great work". This egg sac is my great work, the finest thing I have ever made. What's inside it, eggs? 514 of them. 514. You're kidding. No, I'm not. I counted them. Are you really going to have 514 children? If nothing happens, yes. Of course, they won't show up till next spring. What makes you sound so downhearted? I should think you'd be terribly happy. Don't pay any attention to me. I just don't have any pep anymore. I think I'm languishing, to tell you the truth. What does "languishing" mean? Well, it means I'm slowing up, feeling my age. I'm not young anymore, Wilbur. It may be that-- I don't want you to worry about me. This is your big day. But, Charlotte-- I'm back. What a night. Never have I seen such leavings. Everything well-ripened, seasoned with the passage of time and the heat of the day. Oh, it was rich, my friends, rich. You ought to be ashamed. It would serve you right to have acute indigestion. My stomach can handle anything. Templeton, if you weren't so dopey, you'd notice that Charlotte's made an egg sac. Hooray for Charlotte. She's going to become a mother. For your information, there are 514 eggs in that peachy little sac. This has been a night. Oh, look at Charlotte's web. Now isn't that just the word for Wilbur? You folks want to see something? It's Zuckerman's famous pig. Look what it says in the pen. A miracle! Uncle Homer! Uncle Homer! Uncle Homer! Avery. What's the matter, boy? This pig has won first prize already. Oh, no! Mr. Homer Zuckerman? That's me. I'm to escort you and your famous pig to the grandstand. What for? I don't know, but we'd better get going. Goodness--in front of all those people? Does my hair look all right? It looks fine, Edith. You didn't even look. You're all right, Edith. Just keep calm. Aren't you going to crate him? No. Let him walk so everybody can see him. - Yippee! Yay! - Hooray! Ladies and gentlemen, we now present Mr. Homer L. Zuckerman and his distinguished pig. - Hooray! - Yay! The fame of his unique animal has spread to the far corners of the earth, attracting many valuable tourists to our great state. You will all recall that day last summer when the writing appeared mysteriously on the spider's web in Mr. Zuckerman's barn. This miracle has never been explained. All we know is that we are dealing with supernatural forces here, and we should all be proud and grateful. In the words of the spider's web, this is some pig! - Hooray! - Yay! ? He's some pig ? ? Some pig ? ? Some terrific, radiant, humble pig ? ? He is some pig ? ? Oh, wow, look at him now ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? Sooey, what do you see? ? ? The greatest hog in history ? ? Fine swine, wish he was mine ? ? What if he's not so big? ? ? He's some terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Thing-a-ma-jig of a fine phenomenon ? ? My land, isn't he grand? ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? Golly, you got to agree ? ? He's a real celebrity ? ? Fine swine, wish he was mine ? ? What if he's not so big? ? ? He's some terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Thing-a-ma-jig of a pig ? ? The terrific ? ? Radiant ? ? Humble ? ? Humble ? ? Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? - Yay! - Yay! On behalf of the governors of the fair, I have the honor of awarding a special prize of $25 to Mr. Zuckerman. - Yay! - Yay! And this handsome bronze medal, suitably engraved, to this radiant, this terrific, this humble pig. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. He's some pig. And if I have anything to do with it, he's going to live to a ripe old age. - Hooray! - Yay! ? Oh, wow, look at him now ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? Sooey, what do you see? ? ? The greatest hog in history ? ? Fine swine, wish he was mine ? ? What if he's not so big? ? ? He's some terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Thing-a-ma-jig of a pig ? ? The terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Zuckerman's, Zuckerman's, Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's, Zuckerman's ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? Zuckerman's pig! - Yay! - Yay! It's a beautiful medal, Wilbur, and you deserve it. Are you all right, Charlotte? You don't sound like yourself. I'm a little tired, perhaps, but I feel peaceful. Your success today was, to a small degree, my success. You will live now, secure and safe. Why did you do this for me, Charlotte? You have been my friend. That, in itself, is a tremendous thing. After all, what's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while, and we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess with all this trapping and eating flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my own life a trifle. I haven't got your gift for words, Charlotte, but you've saved me, and I would gladly give my life for you. I'm sure you would. Won't it be wonderful to be back home in the barn cellar again, with the sheep and the geese? I will not be going back to the barn. Not going back? What are you talking about? I'm done for, Wilbur. In a while, I'll be dead. I haven't even strength enough to climb down into the crate. Oh, no! Oh, come, come now, Wilbur. Let's not make a scene. Chin up, remember? Everybody loves a happy face. I can't stand it. I won't leave you alone here to die. I shall stay, too. Oh, don't be ridiculous, Wilbur. Zuckerman's on his way here right now. You'll be going home in a few minutes. Charlotte, w-where's Templeton? He's sleeping. There. Under the straw. Templeton, pay attention. What kind of monkeyshine is this? Listen, Charlotte has only a short time to live. She can't go home with us. It's absolutely necessary that I take her egg sac. You're the only one that can reach it. So, it's old Templeton to the rescue again, is it? Templeton, hurry up! So, it's "Hurry up, Templeton," is it? And what thanks do I get for these services? I'll make you a solemn promise. Get Charlotte's egg sac for me, and from now on I'll let you eat first when Lervy slops me. You mean that? Cross my heart. It's a deal. Use extreme care! I don't want a single egg harmed. This stuff sticks to my mouth. It's worse than caramel candy. Charlotte, your children are safe. Charlotte? I'm thinking of your life, Wilbur. Nothing can harm you now. ? The autumn days grow short and cold ? ? It's Christmastime ? ? Again ? ? Then snows of winter slowly melt ? ? The days grow short, and then ? ? He turns the seasons ? ? Around ? ? And so ? ? She changes her gown ? ? Mother Earth ? ? And Father Time ? ? How very special ? ? Are we ? ? For just a moment ? ? To be ? ? Part of life's ? ? Eternal ? ? Rhyme ? Charlotte? Charlotte? Charlotte! Look at Wilbur. He's got tears in his eyes. Probably having such a good time, he hates to go home. He's not sick, is he? Probably just homesick. I guess we all are. And so, Wilbur came home to his beloved manure pile in the barn cellar. Around his neck, he wore a medal of honor. In his mouth, he held a sac of spider's eggs. Wilbur no longer worried about being killed, for he knew that Mr. Zuckerman would keep him as long as he lived. The autumn days grew shorter. One evening, just before Christmas, snow began falling, and cold settled on the world. All winter Wilbur watched over Charlotte's egg sac, as though he were guarding his own children. And after many long days and nights, the snows melted and ran away. The sun grew warmer, and morning came sooner. The land was good and green again. Everywhere there were signs of life renewing itself. Ha ha ha ha. Hello there. - Hello. - Hello. I'm an old friend of your mother's. Are you all right? Is everything all right? We're just fine. Nice place you've got here. What are you doing up there? Good-bye. Good-bye. Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? We're going out into the world to make webs for ourselves. Are all of you going? You can't all go. Children! Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Oh. What are you up to now? I'm going away. I can't stand it here. This place is too full of memories. All of Charlotte's children are gone. Hello. There are three little runts up there that couldn't fly away. Salutations. Salu what? Salutations. That's my fancy way of saying hello. Are you going to stay? We're too small to fly. Chin up. This is a nice place. Stay here with me. Does that mean we are welcome here? For as long as you'll stay. We like this place, and we like you. We must find names for you. Why are you trembling? I'm trembling with joy. Oh. Then your name is Joy. What was my mother's middle initial? "A." Then my name is Arania. Will you just pick out a sensible name for me? Nelly? Oh, I like that very much. Are you writers? No, but we will be when we grow up. Then write this in your webs when you learn. This hallowed doorway was once the home of Charlotte. She was brilliant, beautiful, and loyal to the end. Her memory will be treasured forever. That would take us a lifetime. A lifetime. That's what we have. Everybody, come see. Quickly! Charlotte's daughters, Joy, Arania, and Nelly. Salutations. - Hello! - Hello! Welcome to the barn. We thought well of your mother. Wilbur never forgot Charlotte. Although he loved her children and grandchildren dearly, none of the new spiders ever quite took her place in his heart. She was in a class by herself. It's not often that someone comes along who's a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both. ? Oh, wow. Look at him now ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? Sooey, what do you see? ? ? The greatest hog in history ? ? Fine swine, wish he was mine ? ? What if he's not so big? ? ? He's some terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Thing-a-ma-jig of a pig ? ? The terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Zuckerman, Zuckerman, Zuckerman, Zuckerman ? ? Zuckerman's... Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? My land, isn't he grand? ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? Golly, you gotta agree ? ? He's a real celebrity ? ? Fine swine, wish he was mine ? ? What if he's not so big? ? ? He's some terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Thing-a-ma-jig of a pig ? ? The terrific, radiant, humble ? ? Zuckerman's... Zuckerman's... ? ? Zuckerman's... Zuckerman's... ? ? Zuckerman's famous pig ? ? Zuckerman's pig ?
