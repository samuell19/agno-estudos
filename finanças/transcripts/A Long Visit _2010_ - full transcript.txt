Mom, what's that? It's a gift from grandmother. - Hello. - Mom! Hi, Jisuk. Why did you make so many things? I thought you had a backache. I told you not to make green onion kimchi. Green onions clear your head. People like you have to eat a lot. Your shoulders won't hurt. The charm I sent. Put it in Junsu's wallet. Stop wasting money at fortune telling places. It's no use. It's for your own good. I'm fine. I'm going to buy kimchi from now on. Don't say that. I'll make it as long as I'm alive. I'd like to come over and clean if you lived nearby. Don't wash the bedding. Just leave it. I'll come soon. Just worry about your back. What if it gets worse? Don't worry about me. I have to go. Your dad's here. Did you have a drink? I had one drink. I'm a little tired. Is he weak? Do you want me to get a tonic? No. A few days of rest should do it. - Hello? - It's me. Mom, what time is it? Baby. Can you come home? Is something wrong? Your father died. That wretch... That wretch... He beat me and gave me a hard time. Why do I miss him so much? He's a wretch whether he's dead or alive. That wretch... I thought I didn't like my father. I thought I hated my father. I didn't think I had any memories of him and I didn't think I'd miss him. Be careful. Put it there. - Be careful. - Okay. - I'll drop you off at the station. - Okay. You should come with us. I can't live in Seoul. It's stuffy. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Go on. Go with her for her sake. I'll be worried, too. Stop it. I said I won't go. Stop being stubborn and listen to your children. It's because of you. It's sad when a married woman has nowhere to go when she's upset. I'll be here. Come when you're upset. I can listen to you even if I can't solve all your problems. Oh, you drive me crazy. Father. I committed a sin. Did you go to a fortune teller again? Oh, you're a fortune teller now. Sister, you promised not to go to fortune tellers anymore. I know, but I had to ask about my children. Mary had Jesus as a son. I'm sure she understands. You should keep your promise. What if you're not saved and you go to hell? Nothing is more precious than a child. No parent would neglect their child out of fear of hell. If you had children... Oh, you don't have children. No wonder you don't understand. You couldn't say that if you had children of your own. I should go. Sister. Sister. Oh, oh. Is my baby home? How did you come? You don't know Seoul well. I might not know Seoul well, but I can find my daughter's place. Where's Hyeyeong? She's sleeping. You must be tired. Let's eat. I don't want to eat. At least eat some soup. Life is rough for a woman if she's smart. The best thing to do is live with money her husband earns for her. Why does he want to study at his age? How are you going to support him? What can I do? He wants to study. Your daughter is growing up. It will cost quite a bit of money. He should be making money, not spending it at an academy. I let him because of father. I'm sure there was something he wanted to do. He couldn't because of his family and he regretted it. Life would be so pathetic if you had to live like that. Oh, oh. Don't you think your life of supporting that would be pathetic? I thought you were smart. I don't know. Whatever. I didn't ask you for help, so stop it. I'll deal with it. What would an ignorant mom like me know about what you do? Do what you want. - Don't start. - Don't start what? I shouldn't talk to you. Here. Eat. Come on. - You're always like that. - What about you and that temper? You are worse. Whenever I had a hard time, mom always told me. If I cry, she cried more. If I was upset, her heart was ripped to pieces. That's how a mother is. The train will be arriving at the station soon. Please check your belongings when you leave. Mom! Mom! Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. You should have told me you were coming. I would have cooked. That's why I didn't call. - What is this? - I got you a tonic. It's with extra deer antlers. Why did you waste money like that? Let's eat. You didn't throw that away yet? Why would I throw my daughter's clothes away? These are your clothes, too. Think of your age. I wear this when I miss you. It smells like you. It's nice. Throw it away now. Okay. Just eat. Do you always eat like this? I'm grateful for this. It's no fun to cook when there's nobody to eat it. Mom. Should we go out for a nice dinner? Why do you want to waste money? You should go when your daughter asks. I don't want to waste money my daughter made with hard work. Your father might have gone. The poor soul left too soon. Are you doing that because there isn't enough food? No, I can't seem to digest very well these days. - Should I make you some porridge? - No. Even the water is good here. Mijeong! - How are you? - It's been so long! What brings you here? When did you come? - I came to see mom. - I'm so happy to see you. - Hi, Jisuk. - Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Sure, you are. Just watch the store. Don't wander off again! - See you. - Yes. I should burn down that coffee shop. Why don't you just announce that your husband is having an affair? I'm not a little girl anymore. I had a baby. Everyone knows he likes the women at the coffee shop. I wore mini skirts before. I didn't have to cut up meat when I was single. Like we said before, I never should have gotten married. You've changed a lot. Nothing has changed here. A rural village doesn't change easily. We changed a lot. You don't look too good. It's because I've been busy. You married well. Slow down a bit. Mijeong. I'm going to be really busy for a while. Check in on my mom often. Father is gone and I can't come often. Sure. Your mom is like a mom to me. Oh, my... Why can't you digest? I made porridge. Eat some. Here. Eat. - What's wrong? - It's hot. Oh, dear. Is it hot? I should have cooled it. It's alright. I'm not a little girl anymore. I can cool it myself. Mom. What? Never mind. What's wrong with you? I just wanted to call you. You must be getting old. Did you have a fight with Junsu? No. Does he know you came here? He doesn't tell me everywhere he goes. You did have a fight. No, stop making me repeat myself. Then why did you come alone? I just came because I missed you. Can't I come? Why do you keep getting angry? It's like serving a queen. You can't say a word to your mother-in-law. I'm easy to push around, huh? - There you go again. - No, there you go again. Is my baby up? Something smells good. Just wait a bit. I just have to get the soup. - Mom. - Yes. Let's go out after we eat. Is there anything you want to do? No. I'm just glad you're here. Do you want to go and see the fall colors? Forget it. You're sick. I'm alright. It's been a while since I had some time off. Let's go out. We never went anywhere together. I want to have a nice time with you. I don't want to, but since you insist, should I wear some make-up? - Let's go. - Okay. - This is nice. - Yes, it is. Look at those colors. - Look at those colors. - They're so pretty. Yes. How pretty. There's a fish there. Right there. Oh, that's cold! Let me see. My face is smaller than yours. - Is that going to stay? - Sure. Oh... Leaves! - Here! - Go ahead! Oh, stop it! Oh... They're charging $32 for a bunch of grass? A $50 meal per person isn't this good in Seoul. Are you crazy? You pay $100 for a meal? - Mom, please. - Oh, boy. Here, you like croaker and stir-fried pork. Eat. Come on. Fine. How much longer will I live? I'll eat if you buy me food. I won't live a pathetic life anymore. Good for you. If Jinho wants to buy you a nice meal, go out and eat with him. If you see something you want to eat, eat it. Live like that, okay? Okay. You should try this. It's expensive, but it's good. This is good. Do you like it? It's pretty. - Try this one, too. - Forget it. - Come on, try it on. - What's wrong with you? It's my wish. Just try it on. Let me see. I don't need... Just try it. Hurry, Hurry. - Do I look pretty? - Yes. Mom, should we take a picture? What for? Let's take a pretty picture. We can get one for your dresser and one for me to take. I'm too old to take a picture. - Let's. - Forget it. Come on. - No. - Hurry up. - Hurry up. - No! Let's just take one picture. Okay, that's good. Will the daughter lean in a bit? Okay. Mother, smile a bit. Okay. Here goes. One, two, three. That was nice, but it's so expensive. He's a thief. It's more expensive in Seoul. Just a minute. - Why? - Just wait here. - Thank you. - Sure. Did you forget something? No, I asked him to add some writing. What? That's a secret. You'll see later. What's the big deal. Tell me. No, just wait. - Come on. - No. - Tell me. - No. It's great. That was nice. You have more energy than I do. I'm so tired because of you. Listen to you. Oh boy. This is nice. I laid you down here and cried a lot. Why? Because life was hard? No. Because my children were suffering because of their parents. You were always so smart. You were really pretty, too. Why am I so pretty? You're pretty because my womb is pretty! I sent you to school and you got perfect scores. You shouldn't have been born with parents like us. I think about that when I can't sleep. Mom, I'm sorry I got annoyed yesterday. Why do you keep saying things like that? What's wrong? A mom knows everything. A mom knows when her child is upset. If a child is sad, the mother's heart is ripped to pieces. I thought you knew everything. Why are you asking? You're suffering because something's wrong. Tell me. Do you need money? Should I try to borrow some? Gee, mom, it's not like that. I'm going to wash up. Jisuk! - That tickles. - I'll be done soon. That tickles! What's wrong with you? Let me finish. Don't come out. You'll catch a cold. Why don't you answer your phone? If you're not going to answer, you should call me. Hello? Junsu, it's me. Mother? Is something wrong? - What about Jisuk? - She's washing up. Did you have a fight with Jisuk? Of course not. Then why did she come alone? She's acting so strange. You know what's going on. Tell me. She's not acting strange. She just missed you. That's why she went to see you. Why do you sound so... - Something's wrong, isn't it? - No, mother, nothing's wrong. This is so frustrating. Tell me right now. Jisuk told me not to tell you. Mother. Jisuk is sick. She should go to the hospital. Why did she come here? I suspected it. She lost so much weight. I'll have to take her to the hospital tomorrow. Mother. She went to the hospital. She's in the final stage of pancreatic cancer. I can't live without her. What will I do? What did you just say? Cancer? Mom, aren't you going to sleep? I'm coming. Just a minute. I'm alright. Are you leaving early tomorrow? Can you stay a little longer? I have to take care of my baby. When will I come again? You can come next month. Don't say that. You can come next month and the next month. Nobody can take you away from me. Nobody can take my baby. Nobody can take my baby as long as I'm alive. My baby, don't worry. You have me. I'm right here. Your mom is right here. I'm going to protect my baby. I'll protect you. I'll protect you. Mom. Just a minute. Mom. Oh, my god! I can't live like that. I can't. I can't live without her. Take me instead. I can't live without my baby. I can't. I can't. I can't. My baby. My baby. My baby. Mom... I'm sorry. Why should you be sorry? What are you sorry for? A lot. For not being nice. For making you lonely. For being disappointed with you. For always hanging up first. My baby, don't say that. You have nothing to be sorry about. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Mom, I should get going. I should be with Hyeyeong now that I saw you. Bye, mom. My baby! My baby. Don't worry. You won't go first. I know everything about you. You won't go first, so don't be scared. I'll protect you. I'll save you if I have to go to the end of the world. I tell you. Go on now. I won't cry since nothing's wrong, so don't cry. Oh, my baby. My baby. My baby. My baby. Thank you. Grandmother, I miss mom. When is she coming? I'll tell your mom that you miss her. Be a good girl, okay? My baby, I went on living even after I sent you off. Another day has passed. That's a day closer to seeing you. I should go soon and talk to you so you're not lonely. I'm so ignorant. I can't sleep because I'm worried I won't find you after I die. My baby. If you hear of my death, don't let me wander. You have to find me. My baby, do you know what? The best thing I did in this world is having you. The thing I regret the most is also having you. I feel sorry asking this, but be my daughter again in the next life. I love you, my baby.
