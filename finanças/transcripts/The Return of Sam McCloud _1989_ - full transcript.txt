[instrumental music] Colleen: Hello. Hello, operator? Damn! [groans] [indistinct chatter] Is there a phone I can use? Phone box out in the square. Vandalized. It must be a national pass time. Please, I-- I've been in a car accident. I-- I thought the villagers of Shereford were the friendly type. Is this the kind of British hospitality we Americans can expect? Depends on who we're being hospitable to, doesn't it? Does that make a difference? If I disown Chemtel Industries, can I call an ambulance? Oh, I'm sorry, love. It's just that tempers have been running a bit high about that factory of yours. Add mine to them. Someone just tried to kill me, ran my car off the road. Come on, come on. Sit here, love. She's over by the bar. Yeah, I've seen her. Don't worry. Uh, I'm Nancy Cratchett. Publican's daughter. I'll ring the hospital. Uh, no hospital. I'll be alright. Here's your drink, love. Call to the States. I'll make it collect. Alright, I'll dial the International Operator. Where am I dialing? Washington, D.C. Now, I understand as well as anyone in this glorious room that the soil is the life's blood of this country. We must preserve it. But at what cost? Now, how much more can the taxpayers stand, with the staggering deficit that this country is facing? Now, an environmental bill must be far-reaching... How we doing? Well, after 19 hours and 41 minutes of Fulton Reese's rhetoric, this committee would kill the Bill of Rights. But it's naive. It doesn't address practicalities. What about the junior senator from New Mexico? I've got Jody Freeman covering our backs. But don't worry, by the time McCloud gets back from his fact-finding mission, his ecology bill will be deader than a coonskin cap. [instrumental music] Uh, Senator McCloud, Senator MacFarland would like to see you in his office. Later. No, he, he said it was urgent, sir. Excuse me, son. - Mr. Chairman! - What this-- You can't interrupt him. It isn't procedure. Mr. Chairman... That isn't the way we do it in Washington. That's the way we do it in Taos. I would like to apologize to the senator from Wisconsin, but I've got something to say about this ecology bill, and I'm not leavin' until it's been said unless somebody aims to hogtie me first. Thank you. Appreciate it. McCloud: You know, the most important issue, the most critical issue that we all face, whether we're old, young, black, white, rich, poor, Democrat or Republican, is how do we save our common home, this earth on which we all live. Because if we don't figure out how to do that, the budget sure as hell's not gonna matter. Neither will the deficit, unemployment, taxes, interest rates. You see, my friends, if we don't save the ozone layer, we simply won't have to worry about those issues, because none of us will be here. Just to jog your memory, the ozone layer is that protective shield around the earth which filters out the deadly ultraviolet rays of the sun and allows life to exist on this planet. And we're destroying it. There's a whole in it at the South Pole. It's bigger than the whole United States, and it's growing as we speak. And when it's gone, that's it. I mean, you can't run down to the general mercantile and buy another one. Do you realize that within the last six hours of this debate, we've spent more money on weapons than we have on the environment in the last ten years! Well, I don't know what you feel about that, but to me, that's the tail waggin' the dog. We've really never faced a situation like this before. The question is, do we survive? Do we continue as a species, or do we just... join the dinosaurs and vanish? Because, my friends, when that ozone layer goes, we all go. Position won't save you, power won't save you, money won't save you. Are we no better than a bunch of lemmings, running headlong towards mass suicide? You know, we're supposed to be the intelligent species. We're the custodians of this planet, the protectors of all living things on it. And we've failed. We've failed to protect them, because there is something more to protection than guns and bullets! So just ask yourself when you vote, just ask yourself, am I voting for life? Am I voting so that my grandchildren and their children and theirs can also know life? Can walk upon this earth and breath it's pure, sweet air, and feel love for each other? You make no mistake about it this wondrous Mother Earth which nourishes each one of us is in pain. She's hurting. She may be dying. She needs our help. She needs your vote. It's your choice. It's your choice! You sleep well tonight. [applause] Bravo! Bravo! There's no one in his office, love. Swell. Where else can we try? The, the Capitol restaurant. All the senators go there. It-- it's their local pub. Thank you. So, you lost to Senator McCloud tonight. Oh, I never lose the battles I fight. I simply postpone victory until a time comes when no one's looking. The junior senator has a way with words. He's a man of the people. That's why I like him. Anyway, the environmentalists have a lobby that's bigger than the Algonquin. Isn't that right, Senator? Well, when Dorothy Parker died, so did my affection for the Algonquin. I couldn't tell you how big the lobby is. You know William Maitland of the Chemtel Corporation. Oh, yeah, yeah. We've locked horns a couple of times. I understand you stirred up a hornet's nest in the senate tonight, senator. They say your environmental bill is going to pass. That's what I came to Washington to do. And now that you've done it, uh, are you going to leave? Well, there's a couple of other hornet's nests that need proddin'. I'll stick around for a while. Glad to hear it. You have a reputation for honor, marshal. Oh, pardon me, senator. I have a reputation that's hard-edged. I built my corporation up from nothing. It cost me long hours, a broken marriage, and estranged children. But I'm proud of what I accomplished. I'd like to think that we have a kindred spirit. Excuse me, Mr. Maitland. It's getting late, and you have the conference call with Geneva to make. Well, until we lock horns again, goodnight, gentlemen. Goodnight. You are making a powerful enemy, senator. That's the only kind you can trust. He knows you're mounting an investigation into his activities. Professional relationships with several senators. Campaign funds coming from sources that campaign funds couldn't come from. Just scratchin' the surface. Are you sure this isn't personal? It's very personal. You have a phone call, Senator McCloud. It's from your niece. Excuse me. [instrumental music] [thunder rumbling] Collie, how you doin'? Sorry, I've been so hard to get a hold of. Hello? Sam? [dial tone] Collie? - Where can I get a taxi? - Uh, out in the square. Hang on a minute, love. Wait! Tom! Tom, help me! Tom, Tom... [mumbling] She's not... She's not to be harmed. Well, we got cut off. Rachel: Tom Jamison's on the phone from England. I told him you were very tired. Always my protector, Rachel. But from the darkness, who protects us from the shadows? I'll tell him to call in the morning. No, wait. I'll take it. What is it, Tom? Lost a bundle on the 4 o'clock at Ascot? Tom on phone: Colleen McCloud just called her uncle. Did she actually speak to him? We cut short her call. But it's the seventh one she's put into the senator in two weeks. She's only got through to him twice. McCloud's a busy man these days, fighting causes, tilting windmills... Is, uh, Colleen still going out with that Bolshevik activist who works for you? Geraint Davies? Yes. Davies is volatile, unstable. He and Colleen have been arguing violently. You tried to warn her about him, but she wouldn't listen. In a moment of rage-- No. I won't allow that to happen. You're going to make it happen, Jamison. What did you do about Simon Langton? Tom on phone: I-- I fired him. - That's not good enough. He was getting too close to Albatross. I want him deactivated. He's disappeared. He-- he... He went on holiday somewhere. Find him! What about Ashley Stevens? Tom on phone: My God, Maitland, what do you want me to do? Gag every scientist we've got working for us? Check and balance system. Like our Western senator would say, encourage the, uh, right avenues of research. And slam the doors on all the others? You are paid to administrate. Well, not to commit murder. Just look the other way, Jamison. Like you've been doing all your life. William: Mr. Jason Cross's suite. He's with the Chemtel convention. [telephone ringing] Check. Hello? William on phone: Senator McCloud's not looking too good. I see. Can't you buy him off? William on phone: Not by the kind of currency we can offer. I want this man silenced. There's too much at stake, and I need to stop his investigation. You can't be worried about that. What does he know? He's a bulldog. Once he's got his teeth into a cause, he never lets go. So, what do you want me to do? William on phone: Our junior senator's made a lot of enemies with his environmental bill. Just got passed tonight. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some kind of violent protest made on behalf of the Third World oil interests. You mean a terrorist attack? William on phone: I just left the senator at the Capitol restaurant. Get your best man in Washington to do the job. And Cross, if anything goes wrong, I'll expect you to do the job personally. Of course. Your move. Queen to bishop seven. This is Jason Cross. You're gonna have to do a job for me tonight. Now, listen carefully... Wait until you see McCloud leaving the restaurant before you set the explosive. Make a ten second fuse, and then get out... fast. Hey, senator... phone call for you. Think your bill's passed. [explosion] - How much? Man 1: Thirty bucks. It's kind of a rough neighborhood. Do you want me to wait? Cheaper gettin' mugged. Change, sergeant. It's inevitable. You pound a beat in the Village, and you think, "I'll never get out of these mean streets." But you do. You spend years as a detective second grade in the shadow of Peter B. Clifford. Uh, who, sir? Before your time. And you feel you'll never make it beyond the bullpen floor. And then suddenly... you're here. Uh, where's that, sir? This office. Promotion. This is your first day on the squad, isn't it, Rifkin? - Yes, sir. - Yes, what? Uh, chief. Yes, chief. This is my first day as the new Chief of Detectives. And there's nothing that can spoil it. You understand me, sergeant? Nothing at all. [instrumental music] Joe! I can't believe this. Chief of Detectives. You know, when I think of all the times that Clifford chewed you out... McCloud: You remember that time down on Bleeker Street that we were under cover, and you had to dress up in this blonde wig... That'll be all, sergeant. Um, yes, chief. Boy, you were a real stunner, I'll tell ya'. I durned near asked you for a date. [laughing] Chief, huh? Well, how's it feel? Great. How does it feel for you, Senator McCloud? What are you doing in Washington? Puttin' out a few prairie fires. Where's Clifford? Peter B. Clifford is the new commissioner of Police for New York City. Really? He's on vacation right now in London. Well, I'll be dipped. We worked together a long time, McCloud. You didn't come to visit. - What's on your mind? - My life. Bomb exploded underneath my car last night. Some people figured that I've riled the oil interests with my new ecology bill, and some terrorists went after me. You don't figure it that way? No, it seems to me like they'd have gone after me before the bill was passed, not after. Here you are, chief. It's no good to lock the barn door after the horse is stolen. Be right back. Thought maybe you might know somebody else who wanted me killed. You want the whole list, or just the highlights? I'm sorry, McCloud. I'll-- I'll dig out the files for you. You locked up a lot of angry people who eventually get out of jail and remember. Where's Grover? Fishing with his grandchildren. Simms? Retired with a pension, thanks to you. - Huh! - When do you wanna meet? Well, the sooner the better. How about Delmonico's for dinner tonight? - Can you make that? - Always did. Good. See you then. Say hello to the family. [instrumental music] Bunch of kids spotted her from the Wharf, Inspector. No formal ID, no driver's license. I found this in her pocket, sir. Turn her over. Colleen. You know her? I took a look at a photograph of her once. An old friend showed it to me. On the dog, sergeant. I want somebody from Chemtel down here right away. No, down to the Yard. Sorry, McCloud. [traffic bustling] [dramatic music] Ah, must bring back memories, huh? A few. McCloud, this is gonna take all night. - I got nothin' to do. - Call for you, marshal. - Thank you, Sal. - Must be a time warp. There's gotta be somebody from the past with a heavy grudge. I'm not that threatening in Washington. Not yet. - Who was it? - The call's gonna have to wait. You know, the trouble with bein' a senator is you can't wear a gun anymore. Once a cowboy... You see that guy in the long coat leanin' up against the post? He's got a .45 in his belt. The guy at the bar directly behind me I think he's with him. So is the guy in the blue jacket to his right. There may be a fourth. I don't know. I didn't see 'em all come in together. I'm gonna take the closest. Don't make a move until I do. Jason: Damn! [gunshots] Everyone on the ground! This is a robbery! [gunshots] Don't think about it. Joe: You alright, Rifkin? Rifkin: Yeah, fine. - Are you alright, McCloud? - Yeah. You're still a good shot. You only winged him. Woman 1: That call, marshal, from England, shall I tell them you're busy? I'll take it. Sam McCloud. Inspector Craig, it's been a long time. How did you track me down? [instrumental music] [bell tolling] We place in your care the soul of Colleen McCloud, in the secure knowledge that she will abide in the house of the Lord. The memory of her spirit, the warmth of her laughter, the solace of her tears will be forever with us. She will always remain in our hearts. Ashes to ashes... Cheerio, old girl. Man 2: Dust to dust... I'm going to find out what really happened. Man 2: Amen. That's a promise. [indistinct chattering] Uh, Senator McCloud, Tom Jamison. I'm Managing Director of Chemtel here in London. It's an honor to meet you, senator. I desperately regret it's under such tragic circumstances. Are you Colleen's closest relative? My brother and his wife were killed in an automobile accident a few years back. I can scarcely believe that Geraint did this. You know the man who killed Colleen? Geraint Davies. He was one of our most brilliant scientist. He'd worked here for three years at Chemtel. Can you tell me something about Davies? We'd had him under surveillance for some time. He carried a Communist card in the late 70's. A troublemaker. I'm not surprised this happened. Oh, this is, uh, this is my colleague, Mr. Cross. He's the head of Chemtel's worldwide security. Pleased to meet you. Senator. Well, if there's anything that we at Chemtel can do anything at all, just, uh, don't hesitate to give me a call. Appreciate it. Goodbye, marshal. You did fine, Tom. Just fine. I'd like to talk to Geraint. Sorry. You're not a marshal anymore. That fella Cross seemed to be a little confused about that. What's that supposed to mean? Chemtel is one of the most powerful drug companies in the world. William Maitland, the man behind it, could reach the President of the United States or a terrorist group, one phone call, any hour, day or night. Are you suggesting that the Chemtel Company has something to do with your niece's death? I'm just leavin' no stone unturned. Well, there's no mystery here. Your niece told Geraint Davies that she was leaving him. He got violent, strangled her, and dropped her in the Thames. I want to hear his version. That's not askin' much. I figure you owe me something for foiling that IRA plot some years back. You know, savin' Queen and country that's gotta count for something. It gets you a drink at the Marlborough Arms from me. Come on. Just let me talk to him, unofficial. One on one, just the two of us. Can't do it. Well, turn your back for five minutes. That's all I'm askin'. Look, we have a witness who'll testify that Colleen and Geraint had a violent argument two hours before she was killed, in which he threatened her. She was strangled with his scarf, he had dirt on his shoes from the riverbank, he has no alibi, he resisted arrest... Inspector, like you said, I'm not a marshal anymore, I'm a senator. If you don't let me talk to him, I'm gonna use diplomatic privilege. Then I get the needle from the American Embassy. Alright, you can talk to him. But if you break any bones, you'll be up on charges. I appreciate that. Excuse me. Chris... I can't believe it. Hello, senator. How did you, uh... I read about it in last night's paper. I knew you'd be here. Sam, I'm so sorry. Thank you. You just look wonderful. It's been so long. There've been so many times in the past few years... so many times I wanted to call you, reach out. Find that rangy marshal who didn't believe in red tape or triplicate reports, but did believe in other people's grief. When there was a wrong to right, he just saddled up and rode off. - Romantic imagery. - Well... - Still comes natural to you. - I needed it. McCloud: You were always the one with the right words. You were always the silent Plainsman. But you're not too silent anymore. No, it's, uh, kind of a hard thing to... to explain. I just got this yearning, this real need, to fight for the land. You know, this old Earth, it's got its problems, but it's worth saving. Well, from what the Times financial page said this morning, you're helping do just that. - I was very proud of you. - It's just the first step. You know, I figured that our trails would cross one of these days again. I was the one that let the homestead slide. - It was my fault, Chris. - It was nobody's fault. There came a time when I had to change my life. Here. Special correspondent for the London Times. That's pretty classy... Yeah. ...for a Mad Ave sophisticate who likes Haagen Daz and the Mets. So how long have you been here? Well, uh, three years. It's been high tea at the Dorchester and low tide on the Thames. Really? I live on a houseboat. Another fantasy realized. Are you happy? Well, it's... not the old McCloud edge of danger when supper's on the table, and I'm worried that you're uptown in a shoot-out, or coaxing young girls contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve, or bailing Joe Broadhurst out of another hostage situation. Well, surprises like that you need like a hole in the head. I'm so sorry... about Colleen. Yeah. I was about the only family she had. You know, it's a funny thing about duty. It's a, it's a hard word to figure. Who's your duty to? To your police chief, to your country? Sometimes important things fall through the cracks, like people you love. Her name was on my telephone list. Problem was, it was 18th down the page. Not important enough to get back to. Sam, you can't blame yourself. I'm gonna find out the truth here. I promise you that. Be careful. No rescuing damsels, no riding your horse down Piccadilly. It's all in the past. I have to go. My houseboat is tied up at Westminster Pier. I'll be there whenever you need me. I appreciate it. Goodbye, marshal. Craig: This is Colleen McCloud's uncle. He wants to ask you a few questions. Five minutes. Colleen has talked so much about you, I kinda feel like I know you. I think maybe you're bein' railroaded for a crime you didn't commit. Why would anyone want to do that? Close as I can figure, because of experiments you've been doin' in the last year. What do you know about those experiments? Just what Colleen has told me on the phone in the last couple of weeks. Closer you got to a breakthrough, the more scared she got. Well, she was a romantic. Overemotional. Thought I was about to find a cure for cancer. - You weren't? - There is no single cure. You ever seen a mirror shattered when a stone hits it? Different, different fractures of glass, different kinds of cancer. But she wasn't talkin' about a cure-all. You were just gettin' close to one possibility, right? We all think we're getting close... but we're just the journeymen. It's management who make all the headlines. Cancer research is big business. There were insurance salesmen workin' door-to-door ten days after the Three Mile Island melt-down. If Chernobyl had been outside London, there'd have been an insurance convention at the Savoy Hotel. Does Chemtel know what kind of research you're into? Well, of course it does. It was funding it. But scientists aren't mechanics. Sometimes... sometimes we have to go off on a tangent. You know, a side door opens, a shadowy corridor we're not supposed to walk down, because nobody knew we had the key to open the door. So, where did this shadowy corridor lead you? What did you find there? Albatross. Albatross? - What's that? - Me. One great bloody albatross. Outmoded ideals. Thinkin' of lives instead of dollars. Who framed you? Well, what difference does it make, hm? Cross, you met with him yet? Relaxed, fascist, weapons man. Maitland's hot breath on our necks. Yeah, I met him at the funeral. Well, I'm surprised he got back in time. From where? Chemtel convention in New York. Still, gives him an alibi, I suppose. Oh, no, he didn't kill her himself. No, that's not his style. Not unless his back's against the wall. Why would he wanna kill Colleen? Not him. He just jumped when the big man snapped his fingers. Well, why would he wanna kill her, Maitland? Because of your research, right? You were taking research into your own hands taking it someplace that you weren't supposed to. What did you find? Forget it. Why did you kill Colleen? No, I didn't kill her. Look, I'm sorry she got involved, but I didn't kill her. - I swear it! - No, you didn't. You just took her pride and her self-respect, but you didn't kill her, and I'm gonna prove that. For her sake, not yours. Jason Cross. He's the head of security for Chemtel in London. I got a description on the fax to you. He was in New York yesterday. Chemtel convention. I want a full dossier on him. I know I'm gonna hate myself for asking you this, but-- He may have been the man who tried to kill me in New York. What? McCloud: Joe, I don't have time to explain but Colleen's death was not a crime of passion, and I'm gonna prove it. I'll check with the FBI. Oh, McCloud, there was a package sent here from your office in Washington. I had them send it out to your hotel in London. McCloud on phone: Appreciate it. I don't suppose there's any point in my asking you to-- Joe, uh, there's something wrong here with the line. I can't hear ya'. I'm gonna have to talk to you later. Take it easy and... don't rile up any tempers. Colleen on tape: Hi, marshal. Oops, sorry, senator. I just got so used to you bein' a marshal, I can't shake it off. I-- I'll start again. Hi, uncle. Boy, are you a hard dude to get ahold of. You must be runnin' the country single-handed. Like I was telling you, I found out more. I walked down Geraint's shadowy corridor, and there's light at the end of it... I'm scared, Sam. I-- I don't understand why anyone would suppress this research, except that it's unconventional. But-- but, hell, you don't get lard lessen you boil the hog, right? You taught me that. Something's going on at Chemtel. I've just discovered the tip of the iceberg. Geraint's working on it. Simon Langton, too. He's funny. Quirky. You'd think he was mixing the ingredients for a better draft beer. Maybe he is. Ashley knows. Uh, Ashley Stevens. She's our new researcher from the Big Apple. Edgy, but gutsy. [chuckling] Why am I rambling like this? Why have I sent this to you? Insurance. I-- if-- if anything happened to me, I... Now, I know you think I'm givin' rein to this A one imagination, but I... [door opens] [door closes] Gotta go now, Sam. Colleen on tape: When you get here, we'll walk through Shepherd's Market and have some bad British coffee at this really neat place with waiters older than time, and... I-- I love you, Sam. I... Dr. Stevens, my name is Sam McCloud. - I'm Colleen's Uncle. - Yes, I know who you are. Colleen described you in rather breathtaking detail. [chuckling] Well, you don't want to always believe what you hear. Only half what you see. Thought maybe I might see you at the funeral. I don't go to funerals. That little girl in there, is she bad sick, is she? She's dying. Neuroblastoma. It's a deadly form of this cancer. What're you treatin' it with? Antimetabolites. Amethopterin. You might know it as methotrexate, if you know anything about chemotherapy, which I'm sure you don't. Well, it's just another form of poison, isn't it? Yes, it is introducing a toxin into the patient's system. Yeah, I remember a-- a SWAT action one night in Brooklyn. These two gunmen held a bunch of people hostage in a park. A young officer opened fire, and when the smoke cleared, the gunmen were dead, but so were most of the hostages. Healthy tissue, diseased tissue it all gets blasted by the radiation. It's kind of a medical shotgun. Can't you operate? [chuckling] Ah, yes, when in doubt, pick up the knife. You don't believe in that, huh? [sighing] What is it that you really want to talk to me about, senator? Well, I just wanted to know about Colleen's involvement in your research. Colleen was Geraint's assistant, not mine. Um, John... would you check her for me? - Definitely. - Just up the hall. She also confided her fears in you. We talked about life and lovers. The difference between Chekov and Dostoevsky, or how can the British working man live on a wage that would be laughed at in Harlem. Well, she also talked about some kind of research. Tangents, I think is the way Geraint described it. Some line of thinkin' that, uh, folks high up at Chemtel wouldn't approve of if, they got wind of it. Some corridor that you and Geraint and Simon Langton were walkin' down. I don't know what you're talking about. [chuckling] Well, I'm talking about a cover up. - Really? - Yeah. I'm very sad that Colleen's dead... and I'm also very tired. I wish there was something I could do to bring her back... or to save the life of that little girl in there, but there isn't. So you go and fight for the environment, and I will fight to save the lives who are going to enjoy all that clean air and green pastures. Because there's nothing you can do to help me, and there's nothing I can do to help you. Senator. Does the word "Albatross" mean anything to you? Uh, no. [engine revving] [tires screeching] [gunshots] [groaning] [dog barking] Come on! Where the hell are you taking me? - Get in! - Let me go, will you? [man groaning] [tires screeching] Find out who was in charge out there, and get him up here on the double. Yes, sir. We'd be better of with a bunch of boy scouts. Man 2: Here you are, sir. Craig: Just what the doctor ordered. He came in like a lean Brahma bull out of the chute. Very funny. Here deal with this. What kinda police force you runnin' here? Best one we got on a busy night. You never let a suspect get away from you on the streets of New York? You're up against Chemtel. You know that, don't ya? Do me a favor. I told you about William Maitland. Murder would be no problem for him, if it meant protectin' his power, his position, his money. Go back to Washington, senator, where you can do some good. If you don't find Geraint, I'm goin' to. You take the law into your own hands, and you'll be cooling your heels at Her Majesty's pleasure. We've thrown a net around a five mile radius from the kidnap point, and we should have the suspect back in custody in, uh, about one hour. There's nothing for you to do, senator. Go home. Inspector, when I see a city slicker bein' suckered at a county fair into takin' a ride in a molasses barrel down the main drag, I just naturally stick my foot out to stop the slidin'. You don't know what you're dealin' with here, I do. And I'm gonna do what has to be done to bring Colleen's murderer to justice. And if that turns out to be Geraint Davies? I'll bring him back to you in one package, nice and neat. - Molasses barrel? - Well, don't ask me. I don't understand a bleedin' word he says. Man 3: Good-bye, Mr. Davies. [gunshots] [groaning] [crowd applauding] [cheering] McCloud: Good day to you. Hello. I appreciate your coming to meet me. Senator, I'm sorry I was short with you yesterday at the hospital. No, you're a man with ideals I respect. I do understand your grief, but you have to believe there's nothing I can tell you about Colleen's death. I didn't come to talk about Colleen. I came to talk about cancer. You can talk about that, can't you? Sure. Um, what is it that you'd like to know? Oh, some ideas the AMA would disapprove of. You mean like Chaparral Tea, or Haematoxylon dissolved to DMSO? - Iscado? - Possibly. That's, uh, mistletoe to you and me, isn't it? You've done some homework. Well, according to the American Cancer Society, those methods are absolutely worthless. Yes, and where does that leave us? There's been virtually no improvement in cancer research for over 35 years. Not using orthodox methods. Well, have you found a better way? Well, cachexia, weight loss is the prime cause of cancer death. All cancer cells live by fermenting sugar in anaerobic or airless reactions. They do what? Uh, cancer uses sugar for fuel. But it only partially metabolizes it, leaving a-- a waste product called lactic acid. This is spilled into the blood, and sent to the kidneys and liver where it's converted into glucose. This is sent back to the cancer cells for fuel, but it leaves the body withering away. Well, what you're sayin', if I'm hearin' you right, is that if you could find a way to corral that process-- No, you actually block it with a key enzyme in the liver, stopping the circle. And then you can arrest certain tumors. It's unorthodox. How far have you got? I can't tell you that. - How far did Simon get? - I don't know. - Well, let's ask him. - I don't know where he is. - When did you talk to him last? - Uh, three days ago. - Where was he? - I don't know! He called me. Well, of course you don't know, because he's run to ground. Colleen is dead, and he's scared, and so are you. Well, you've got a right to be... wonderin' who's next. Now, I can help you, but you've gotta help me. Your niece was killed by her lover. That's all there is to it. McCloud: Oh, that's a hill of beans, and you know it. She was killed because of your research, or Simon's. Somethin' radical that one of you got onto to with, what do you call it, your blindside studies that nobody knew you were chewin' on except my niece. Ashley on recorder: Those studies are confidential. Let me speak to Mr. Maitland. This is Jason Cross. Yes? Jason on phone: McCloud is nosing around, trying to find Langton, talking to your hotshot New York scientist. All she's given him so far is a cancer lecture. You know what to do about McCloud. Killing McCloud in the States made sense. - He wasn't involved yet. Ashley: Look, I have to go now. Now he's talking to Scotland Yard, and Chemtel employees. William: Hold up, will you? - I've got a better idea. Ashley: No. I said I have to go. I'll report to you later. [telephone beeping] Wait a minute... It's dangerous talking to you. You're investigating your niece's murder. I can't let them think I'm helping you. [tires screeching] [instrumental music] [tires screeching] [music continues] Beat back, there. Oye! Over there. Beat back. Do you hear? Excuse me... [gun firing] [groaning] Are you crazy? [tires screeching] [horse neighing] [gasping] Hyah! Grab on! [Ashley grunting] [engine sputtering] [tires screeching] [horn honking] They're right behind us! Hold on. [horn honking] [instrumental music] [horn honking] [music continues] [horse galloping] Okay, sweetheart, all set. Tickets to Phantom of the Opera, dinner at Le Caprice, and a walking tour of Sherlock Holmes Baker Street tomorrow morning at 11:00. Oh, wonderful. Oh, darling, Joe Broadhurst has been trying to reach you. Ah. Oh, probably just nerves. You know, first few days as new chief. It's good for him. Let him sweat it out. - I feel at such peace here. - Of course you do. Tradition. The ceremony, the changing of the guard... calm of ancient buildings, the reassurance of the London Bobbies. Long way from the streets of New York, huh? You know, I-- I really thought I'd miss it... Peter... The mangled lives, the deceit, the murder, the cheating, the greed. Peter: But I didn't think... - Peter. [laughing] You know, that reminds me of the time in New York that... Do we still have that bottle of pills marked McCloud? [instrumental music] McCloud... what next? I'd like to get this fella back into its proper hands. St James's Palace, straight ahead. Just the place. [horse trotting] McCloud: Had to borrow him from a policeman. See that he gets home, will you, partner? You alright? [sighing] One hell of a ride. I still can't believe they're trying to kill me. Well, especially right out there in the open. They must've been really desperate. I would've expected a cooler head from Cross. - He frightens me. - He should. They must believe that I'm a lot closer than I really am. I'm gonna ask you for one last time. Closer to what? Come on. You gotta tell somebody, sometime. I'm at least somebody you can trust. You were right. It's a breakthrough. Isolating certain tumors. Well, which outlawed method did you latch onto? Laetrile. I-- it's not a folk remedy or the quackery that's been heaped upon it. Laetrile is just amygdalin a cyanogenetic glycoside... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. You're losin' me. Oh. It's, uh, sugar, apricot pits, bitter almonds. - Laetrile is in all of those? - That's right. Laetrile, now, on it's own, that is... it's not worth a plugged nickel on a Saturday night. That's right. But the right chemical with the right enzyme would be lethal to certain cancer cells. - You found the enzyme? - I found the chemical. But I have a lot of work I have to do, and I need my files. - Where are they? - At Chemtel. Okay... You go to this address, I got a lady friend there that'll take care of you. I'll get the files tonight. Give me some keys. It's a bug. A very sophisticated piece of equipment. They must've been trackin' you ever since they found out that Colleen confided in you. Okay, what about the keys? Which is which? Okay, this'll get you inside, this is the key to my lab door. And, uh... you'll be careful? Now that the shock is wearing off, it occurs to me that you just saved my life. Yeah, well, it, uh, seemed like the thing to do at the time. Colleen was right. You are a man you can trust with your life. Oh, no, she was wrong. I failed her. You know, sometimes, uh, you look at the whole prairie, and it's so diffused with sunlight that... Well, you just kinda, kinda miss the little critters that are hurtin' by the side of the road. You try to find your friend Simon. I figure his life's also in danger. And you make sure that you go to that address, you hear? [instrumental music] Geraint! [groaning] Craig: Where did you get that? Smuggled it through customs in your luggage, or bought it in a back alley when you... I never smuggled it, I never bought it, I've never seen it before. It's premeditation either way. You really had me fooled, senator. Let me talk to Geraint Davies. Five minutes. Just turn the other way. You never had any intention of talking to him. - You came here to kill him. - That's not true. What do you think, we're a bunch of country bumpkins here? We're still cobbled streets, pea-soup fog, Bow Street runners? What makes you so arrogant that you think you can come on my turf and take the law into your own hands? Is that what you did in New York? I misjudged you, senator. You misjudged me. - Why haven't you asked for it? - Asked for what? - Diplomatic immunity. - Because I don't want it. I use diplomatic immunity, the folks back home will think that I'm hidin' something. I gotta stand out in the open where people can see me, and prove that I'm innocent of all charges. And how the hell are you going to do that, senator? Want to buy an old friend a cup of coffee? Chris! Chris Coughlin, still gorgeous. [laughing] What, are you here with Mc Cloud? I thought you two had broken up. You never break up with McCloud. He's always there somewhere in the corner of your mind. - Well... - Or your heart. Thank you. Well, what are you doing in London? I live here. Look, chief, you know he didn't do this. Do I? Sam was framed by someone at Chemtel Industries. - Oh, that's ridiculous. - Is it? Yesterday an American scientist who worked for Chemtel came to my houseboat, Ashley Stevens. Sam sent her, just after they tried to kill her. After who tried to kill her? Isn't that what you have to find out? Me? I remember a Christmas not so long ago, you and I were in a children's ward, you were Santa, I was trying to spread some Christmas cheer to those kids, and the doors burst open, and three desperate young people held us at gunpoint. Now, I don't need to be reminded-- Sam put his life on the line for us. Now his life's on the line. He's been framed. Un-frame him. You have way way with words. Craig: An old friend to see you, senator. Peter: Well, I wish this reunion was under different circumstances, senator. I appreciate that. Uh, what-- what... Chris Coughlin sent me. Well, you want to, uh, tell me about it? Tell you about what? Whatever it is you're hiding from everyone else. - You sound like the inspector. - Cops are cops. What are you involved in... I'm being framed, chief, framed. If you've been framed, it's the neatest job I've seen in a long time. The pawnbroker identified you as the man who bought the gun. He-- he identified a man, the same general build, came into his shop wearin' a cowboy hat and a sheepskin coat. Now, put you in that outfit and he would have identified you. - I didn't buy a gun. - Your fingerprints were on it. One thumbprint on the barrel. Now, a ballistics expert from the NYPD would tell you there is no way that I could hold that gun in that position and fire it. Peter: Then how did your prints get on the gun? Sam: Well, how do I know? Lifted it, I guess. If you didn't struggle with the deceased, how do you account for the fact that your hair was under his fingernails? Sam: A forensics expert will tell you that that hair was put under his fingernails, it wasn't pulled out. It's all circumstantial evidence, chief. Somebody at Chemtel has killed Colleen, and I'm onto to somethin', the trail's gettin' hot. Otherwise I wouldn't be sittin' in this stinkin' jail. Chemtel has a right to be hostile. You-- you broke into their facility. What the hell were you looking for? Evidence against William Maitland. That's like tryin' to bust the Pope for tax evasion. Yeah, well, I got him runnin' scared. Yeah, so I see. And you gotta get me outta here. McCloud... I am the new commissioner of police for the City of New York. I have no influence here. Chief, I'm not askin' you to get me out of here with influence. You're asking me to break you out of jail? I'm just asking you to give me a helping hand, that's all. Remember that armed robbery in Brooklyn? The Bremmmer boys? Remember how Bremmer took off right after we had the cuffs on him? - Don't even think about it. - I got no choice. I'm bein' arraigned at 12 o'clock tomorrow. I'd appreciate it if you'd kinda come by and wish me luck. They're gonna nail my hide to the wall. Now, how's that gonna look to the folks back home? Now, how's it gonna look when they see their senator in some jail in a foreign country, his name splashed all over the front pages? My credibility sinks to zero. I know that I'm innocent, and I gotta have a chance to prove it. Nobody else will. Get me out of here, chief. You want me to send you what? McCloud's in trouble? McCloud's always in trouble. I'd have to talk to Elkins on the SWAT team. Right. I got it. Special messenger. Leave it to me. I'll take care of it, chief. You're the Chief. I'm the Chief. Next week this time, I may be pounding a beat again on the Lower East Side. I spoke to my attorney in New York. He's going to arrange for someone here to represent you. Afraid there's nothing more I can do, senator. Good luck. Appreciate it. [dramatic music] [explosion] [glass shattering] [alarm blaring] [instrumental music] Senator? Yes, I've located Simon. He's staying with his aunt. - Chemtel doesn't know about it. - Well, that's good. There's a pub called The Hanged Man at Rotherhithe, down by the dock. Meet me there at 10 o'clock, and bring him with you. [piano music] - Glad you're okay. - How you doin'? McCloud, this is Simon Langton. - Hello. Good to meet you. - Appreciate you comin'. I know you've been layin' low. Wouldn't you? Two of my friends, one of them your niece, are dead. Now, I know enough that I could be next. Ashley says you can help. But if I read the headlines in the "Evening Standard" correctly, you're in no position to help anybody, yourself included. Anyway, I just can't believe this of Tom Jamison. Sam: I know. Simon: He's a decent man. Yeah, well, he's also in debt up to his ham-hocks gambling. Jason Cross, Jamison's head of security, works directly for Maitland. Broadhurst said that the FBI has a file on him as a mercenary for hire. A paid killer. Yeah, yeah, you're exactly right. [telephone ringing] About time. The Hanged Man, pub down at the dock. Every copper in London's got his bleedin' picture. [instrumental music] [siren blaring] Sam: Well, you see what we've got here are three scientists, different fields, all close to a breakthrough in cancer research. Not miracles, but glimpses of hope. With what we've learned from orthodox medicines and our research, we're getting closer to finding the key enzyme in isolating certain tumors. Tell the chief here how much a-- a Laetrile pill would cost on the retail market if it was legal. Three cents. If it was hydrazine sulphate, even cheaper. There you go. You see, if, as Dr. Michael Gershaovich of the Petrov Research of Oncology in Leningrad believed in 1979... Whoa, whoa, wait a minute there. I can't keep up with you on the trail you're followin' there. Neither can the chief. Well, speak for yourself, senator. Mick who? Well, the point is that a great many distinguished scientists believe the same thing that the three of you believe... that unorthodox approaches can be of value. Chemtel knows that. They know that. But you see, Chemtel is makin' six billion dollars a year manufacturing drugs for cancer treatment. Orthodox procedures. Now, the isolation of a certain tumor here and there, your minor breakthroughs, that's gonna save a few lives, yeah. But it's gonna cost William Maitland a ton of money. That's monstrous. [piano music] Where would your files have been taken? The plant in Shereford. They'd have all been put on a disk at the company's main computer there. Then that's where albatross will be. Could you break into the main computer from there? No problem. Sam: Anybody know of a pub in Shereford? Uh, The Falcon. I'll meet you at The Falcon tomorrow night. I think we got some visitors. Reckon you could start a fight? Who'd like another drink? Ooh! Damn! [glass shattering] [glass shattering] [Sam whistling] Taxi! Come on, chief. [music continues] [glass shattering] - Whatcha, guv? Where to? - Waterloo Station. Ahh, absolutely the spiffing spot. Lovely night to see the old rummies shuffling about, talking to themselves. Hey, did you ever listen to what they talk about? Probably solve all the world's problems, eh? [siren blaring] Was there a little something you forgot got to tell me? My name is Sam McCloud... Man 5: I know who you are. Your mug's plastered all over the front page of the "Evening Standard." I take it you're not on friendly terms with plod. Oh, Bill, please. Would it help if I told you I was innocent? I shouldn't think so. [chuckling] Alright, say no more. Hold on to your credentials. Might get a bit how's-your-father round the houses. [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [siren blaring] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] Alright, we've lost 'em. Uh, where to now? We need to get to a place called Shereford. It's a little seaside town. Blimey, that's near Southampton. That's a fair old stretch outside the smoke, guv. Tell you what, I'll drop you near the station, out in the sticks a bit. Appreciate it. [train whistle blowing] Got any change, chief? No. Here's, uh, 50 pounds. Oh, good. Keep the change. Thanks for gettin' us here. Pleasure's entirely yours. You better look live on your plates. It was Old Bill havin' the dick of dirt's off your backs before you could say mine's-a-bite. [chuckling] Ta-da! - What's he talking about? - I don't know. Maybe you didn't give him enough tip. [train whistle blowing] [siren blaring] [whistling] No time for phone calls now, Thomas. You don't want to be late for Mr. Maitland's "Welcome to the UK" party, do you? That would be churlish, wouldn't it? Geraint, you killed him. These ties can be tricky things, can't they? Your wife should have done it before you left home. Alright, is she? And the, uh... little ones? Not so little now, I fancy. And Peter, he's up at Oxford, isn't he? First rate. Mr. Maitland's waiting. [instrumental music] You've got that look in your eyes, Thomas. Dark clouds on the horizon? You've gotta loosen up, have some fun. He's a killer, Rachel. You know that. I'd advise you to keep that sort of talk under wraps. You're so far under his spell, you don't see what's happening. - What happened to Colleen? - You're angry, Tom. I don't know why, and I don't care. But you're talking about a philanthropist, a great innovator. Someone who saved you from ruin. And you from loneliness? How dare you! Man 6: She didn't solve the problem. [indistinct chattering] He's, uh, still at large? There's a big police dragnet. But old habits die hard. I'd say McCloud knows how to hide himself in any kind of environment. Double the security at the Shereford plant. We'll be going down there tomorrow. Use your own contacts, Cross. But find him. Yes, sir. [train whistle blowing] Sorry, I had to get you into this, chief. [scoffing] I knew what I was getting into. I didn't figure you'd get in this deep. You got me this far. I can get the rest of the way on my own. I appreciate your concern for my welfare, McCloud, but it may have come just a little too late. [siren blaring] Our move, senator. What'll it be? Together? Together. [grunting] [Peter groaning] - Ah, my leg! - I got you, chief. I got a local map from the fella at the filling station. I see you're hurt. [chuckling] You're not walking too good yourself. - You know somethin'? - What? This sort of thing was easier ten years ago. [chuckling] Well, ten years ago we were a little smarter. You got a match? Ten years ago we would have waited until the train stopped, and then gotten off. Oh, yeah, see, here's where we are. He circled the spot. Here's A30. Shereford's over here. We got the New Forest between us and the ocean. How far is that? - Thirty miles, I reckon. - I'll never make that. Oh, you go on ahead, McCloud. I'll find some shelter. We're in this together, chief. I'm not leavin' you behind. Unless you want to stay at a hospital. You still got that option. Sure, and an hour later the whole Hampshire constabulary's down on my head and yours. Now, you leave me. That is an order, McCloud. [grunting] [Peter groaning] Well, I'm glad you're obeyin' like you always did. Anybody ever tell you you'd talk the leg off a donkey? - They wouldn't dare. - Just lean on me. [scoffing] The day I have to lean on you, McCloud, is the day I turn in my badge. Just don't lean too hard. [instrumental music] Only you would think of hiding out in a British mansion, McCloud. Don't you think we should at least use the tradesmen's entrance? Well, who knows this might be the tradesmen's entrance. Got a place where we'll be more at home. You might be more at home. Peter: How far did we get? McCloud: Six miles. - You hauled me six miles? - Were you hopin' for more? Well, I was hopin' you'd hail a cab. It's too risky. Just relax, chief. [Peter grunting] You know, the first time I saw you, McCloud, I thought... thick. [chuckling] Well, conditioned reflex, I suppose. You don't really look at what you don't understand. Appreciate it. First time I saw you I thought, big city cop... starch in his collar, cynicism in his veins. Well, you don't get to be the commissioner of police of the Big Apple unless you've got an iron fist. And you don't need a velvet glove. Is that so? This may bite a little bit. - What the hell was that? - Horse liniment. Don't want you gettin' infected on me. Thanks a lot. Why did you take the job, anyway? Oh, I don't know. I guess I thought it was what Mary wanted. - Did you ever ask her? - No. Never occurred to me. You know, that's the difference between you and me. You know, I... I look directly at what's in front of me. You seem to be able to stand back and see the horizon. What do you call that? Prairie time? Yeah, time to appreciate a sunset... watch your child first climb the stairs... look at a tree planted in the center of a cement jungle. I never did any of those things. Well, sweepin' the crime off the streets of New York, that's a full-time job. So is living, McCloud. You seem to be able to do both. That's why I always bit the end off my cigar anytime anybody mentioned your name. [chuckling] You know, I'm not surprised you became a senator. It's a natural step. You're a man who cares... stands tall against the sky. You don't have to butter my bread, chief. Well, dammit, McCloud, I'm tryin' to say somethin' that's been overdue for a long time now. [sighing] - Appreciate it. - Don't mention it. You know... chief, you sure can't tell how fast a horse will run by the color of its hide. I'm gettin' old, I guess. Maudlin. I have no sentiment. Haven't you heard that? [chuckling] Yeah, yeah, I heard that in every precinct house in New York. - Don't forget it. - I won't. - Goodnight, McCloud. - There you go. [Peter sighing] [rooster crowing] [door creaking] [dog barking] We got to get out of here, chief. Let's go! You always wanted to be a cowboy. Never. Never! [door opening] [horse neighing] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [dramatic music] Hyah! McCloud! I want off! - Off, McCloud! - Hyah! - Whoa! - McCloud! Hang on, chief! [whistling] Hyah! Peter: My wife will never forgive you! [horse neighing] [siren blaring] [indistinct radio chatter] He's been spotted! In the Lyndhurst district. - Where's Lyndehurst, sir? - Hampshire. Call the chief constable's office. Tell him I'm on my way. Man 7: He's on a horse. - What else? This is The Falcon Pub, isn't it? This is The Falcon Pub. I'm Nancy Cratchett. Rhymes with ratchet, you having trouble remembering. My dad owns the place. This is going to take a little explaining... Alright, I know who you are. But I didn't exactly expect you to arrive on horseback. Takes style, I'll say that. The chief here has a pretty badly chewed up leg. - He may need some help. - It's alright. Help me get him upstairs. [Peter groaning] Dr. Stevens told me all about you. Your friends are waiting in the bar. They say you're going to do something about this filthy Chemtel place killing our fish and dripping foul waste on our birds. - Is that right? - Well, I'm giving my best shot. - McCloud, are you alright? - Yeah, fine. Where's the commissioner? [sighing] He's hurt. - Nancy Ratchet has him up.. - Cratchett. Cratchett. He's up in her room. She's gonna see that he gets to the hospital. Tell me about this Chemtel thing. Ticklish to get into. I swanned around the backstreet bookstores, chatted up the locals, and soaked in some of the Shereford history, and I found this old map in the back of an almanac that dates back to the 15th century. Old smuggling territory, just as I fancied. But it could be useful to us for getting in. Where is the Chemtel plant? Simon: Here. We'll need a boat. Boat? [frogs croaking] McCloud: How in the world you figure we're gonna get in there? Looks like a few armies have tried and failed. Simon: We're going to take them by surprise. McCloud: Oh, well, that's different. [intense music] Simon: These stairs should lead up to the old wine cellar. [door opens] [door creaking] [door closes] There! [door creaking] [instrumental music] [groaning] I love this village. This village does not love you. We've poisoned them. Chemical waste is a by-product of reality. I don't like it any better than you do. Something has to be sacrificed. Innocent lives. Do try and curb your melodramatic ideas. Chemtel is your family now, Tom. We're all in this business together. The business of power. Don't you ever forget that. [door thudding] Can you check into the main computer from here? Sure, but the Albatross file might be in a different memory bank. I'll let you know. I did most of my work in the bio-tech lab. - My files may be there. - Let's check it out. I'm not a part of your family. I'm not a part of your world. You killed that little girl. You're getting emotional again, Tom. And I sat there and let it happen. All my life I've looked the other way. You just said that. But I'm not gonna do it anymore. I'm looking at you, Maitland... You know what I see? A gold-plated maggot that should be crushed underfoot! [groaning] [intercom buzzing] Yes? Man 8: Intruders inside the building, Mr. Maitland. Man 8: We're searching it. - Thank you. Find out what's going on. If I said the letters "A-T" what would you say? - Arrested tumors. - AT-14. That was part of Colleen's message to me. Now, maybe the Albatross file has a 14 code in front of it. Jason: Absolutely right, senator. For somebody who's supposed to be smart, uh... [chuckling] this is pretty stupid. You don't think I came here alone, do you? There must be fifty cops on the grounds right now. Nice bluff, McCloud. Don't even think about it. There is a disease here, senator. It's called survival. Some make it, some don't. [gunshot] [both grunting] [glass shattering] [glass shattering] [McCloud grunting] Nice try, marshal. [glass shattering] Tom: That's enough. You're a strange man, Jamison. Don't you have any conscience about what's goin' on here at all? Haven't you ever... cared for somebody, really cared for 'em that died from some disease that you could have helped with? You're right. No more. Where's Maitland? First floor up, end of the corridor. Obliged to you. Here, if he wakes up, cover him. Be right back. [printer whirring] Got it. [printer whirring] [door opens] Advances in Laetrile. Hydrazine sulfate. What other possible cures is in that Albatross file? If this company had found a cure for cancer, it would have been worth a fortune. Maybe. If it was a single answer, which we know that it isn't. Just minor breakthroughs, how do you feel about them? I don't know what you're talking about. Care for a drink, senator? You ever seen what cancer does to a person? It devours more than just their body. It cuts into their spirit and destroys their dignity. Come off that righteous high horse, senator. We suffer cancer breakthroughs every week. None of them are worth a damn. Then I don't suppose you'd mind turnin' over this Albatross file to the authorities, just so people can read how conscientious you've been here at Chemtel. The information in that file is classified. I'm talking to a murderer on the run from the British police. I wonder who the public are going to believe? We'll let them decide, Mr. Maitland. We're gonna shake up this medical profession, you and I together. - You alright? - Yeah. Feel kinda like I was, uh... Rode hard and put away wet? [chuckling] Couldn't have said it better myself. I printed out the Albatross file. If it gets us one step nearer, it'll be worth it. Good. Excuse me. McCloud: Inspector. Reckon I owe you and explanation. Get in the car. McCloud: Maitland confessed arranging the murders of Colleen and Geraint Davies. So I guess that makes me a free man. You don't sound too happy about it. Well, you know, chief, I... I used to be passionately involved in every idea I ever had. A man rustles cattle, and I saddle up and ride out. He drew first, I drew faster. I'm doin' the same thing in the halls of Washington... but who am I doin' it for? Well, I read about your environmental bill. Obviously, you didn't draw it up just for yourself. Colleen lost because of it. You can't be all things to all people. You're one man against a system, and I think you're gonna win the small battles, McCloud. The ones that add up. Who knows you might even help win the big one. One that just might save this planet from ourselves. Well, I'll look in on you tomorrow. I'm fine. I don't need mothering, especially from you. [chuckling] Peter: One more thing... Will you please go back to that girl? You know, the one that's been standing there waiting for you to step down out of the sunset. - I'll, uh, I'll think on it. - Just don't think too long. Appreciate your sentiment, commissioner. There you go. [door closes] What did I say? Marshal, my mate Spiros in New York sends his regards. And he wants me to tell you that all the cabbies involved in what was fondly known as the, uh, Great Taxi Stampede knew you was innocent of all charges. I appreciate that. Oh, I just brought a friend of yours in from Heathrow. Looks like the party has started without you. - Think you can catch up? - Oh, yeah. As long as there's a fiddle player to keep the hoedown hummin', we'll bounce on, do-si-doe right, get 'em with a bobtail, and shake 'em to death. - You bet. - Oh, yeah. What's he talking about? Joe! What're you doin' here? This is a reunion party not to be missed. - Direct orders from the chief. - Well, you're the chief. Oh, right. Joe: I think you're right over there. Thank you. You and Simon are all set at Chemtel, are you? Hm, new management, new head of research, a government inquiry. Washington sub-committee arrives tomorrow. Sure you wouldn't want to head it up? Well, I know the senator that's in charge, McFarland. He'll, uh, he's ambitious. He'll do a good job for you. Get you closer to your goals. If you'll excuse me for a moment. You remember I told you once that a friend is just a... a lover without the rude bits? Mmm. Could we be rude tonight? I brought one more guest, so the party would be complete. Don't blow this one, McCloud. I'll have you back pounding a beat with Broadhurst. Hmm? Appreciate it, chief. [ship horn blaring] I'm sorry I was late. I was trying to make myself look ten years younger so you'd remember, the Chris you left behind. I never forgot her. And I'm more interested in the Chris that's standing right here. You know... I never was, uh, very good with words, but-- That's not what I hear from the senate floor. I think we've had enough prairie time between us. I live in London... and you work in Washington. I've got a long rope on my saddle. Give it your best throw, cowboy. Craig: If he ever leaves the senate, you think he'd go back into law enforcement? [scoffing] Does a horse get saddled? Simon: Ah, man. Blueberry pie. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [music continues]
