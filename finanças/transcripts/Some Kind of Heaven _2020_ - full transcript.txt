My father had flown the coop, and my mother worked as a maid at a hotel. It was very, very lonely. One day I found a baby squirrel, and I brought it home, and I put it in a shoe box. Several days later, when I went home, it was very, very sick. It was actually dead, but I didn't know it at the time. I had forgotten to feed it for a couple of days. So, I took it out of the box, and I laid it on a table. And I prayed and I prayed for several hours. And then my mother came home, and she found us. She was furious. She picked it up and she threw it in the garbage. And I lost control. I started screaming and crying, "Mama, Mama! God didn't answer my prayer! God didn't answer my prayer, Mama!" She turned to me, she gave a little chuckle, and she said, "Judy, God answers all our prayers. It's just rarely is it ever the answer we're looking for." And that was it. That was it.
