Let me go! Shut up, dickhead. Ouch, let me go, man. What's in here? Did someone take a dump in your brain? Take it out, everything. Credit cards, cash, take it all out. Hurry up. What's this? Chill out, man. What's this? You're stealing lollipops? You bum! -Do you want to get us all busted? -Those are chameleon lollipops. They change their color after you lick them. Those are lollipops, you scumbag! Use your brain, for once. They won't bust me because of that, okay? All good. They won't. But if they catch you... you, me, Darko, mom... we're all busted. Do you want that? Do you want that? They Will never catch me, man. Trust me. Are you Batman? Where are your Wings then? Show me. Darko, he thinks he's Batman. -Are you Batman? -Hey. So you never steal anything again. Calm down, you two. Don't make such a big fuss. Who's the king, huh? Who's the king of Germany? Say it. -Yanoosh. -What? No, man. Manolo is the king of Germany. I am the king. Say it, come on. Here's your money. Clutch. -Although... -Look out for a clutch. You know, the guys didn't even take that much. I... What do you want With that? I need money for myself, too. Throw it properly. We really didn't take that much. -Look, there's an exhaust pipe. -What? -Bro, it's right there. Come on. -Clutch... Open your eyes. You don't get much. You worked like shit today. -That's enough. -Eat, so you grow up. Stand up. Stand up. God bless, if you get a divorce... ...you shall rot in hell. But first I will choke you with these hands. Darko? Is it a lion or a princess? A lion. Darko! Eat something, damnit. You're just skin and bones. People are already rumoring that I'm a bad mother. Too bad you're not my boy. What do you say, Ramona? I'll adopt him and you'll be rid of this rascal. You can have him right away. I'll give him to you. I have the perfect woman for you. -Merzedes, from Poland. -What? Merzedes? The one with the black pimples? Who looks like a witch? Also she doesn't have any teeth. Oh, mom. Hey. I'm done with everything. So what? Well... all the best. I want my damn money! And you shut up, you dickheads. What did you say? Nothing, he didn't say anything, right? I want my money. He wants his money. I gave you a roof... as if you're my own son. You live in my house. Cheap. If he doesn't get his money, I don't want mine either. Ungrateful bastards. Hey, jerk! Leave me alone! Fuck you, man! He can't swim! What a shame. Let me go! Darko! Darko! Darko. Help! Help! He can't swim. Do something, damnit. Please. Please, do something. Come here. Come here. What's going on? Is he okay? Are you okay? Darko! Call an ambulance! Do something. No doctor, damn! -Shit! -Deep breaths. Listen to me. Deep breaths. As deep as you can. Come on. Breathe in! That's it. That's it. Well done. You are okay. He's okay! Come here. Mademoiselle. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, we have to go. Darko? Hey, what's up? Did I miss the best party? Not a word to Chanel or Ramona, okay? -100 Euros to keep me quiet. -Shut up. -Here. -Thanks. Where's Yanoosh? Do you need a ride? Look after my mother. Hey. Hold on, let me help you. Here. I will bring you home, okay? Be careful. Hold on tight. Hold on! Are you suicidal or what? Are you feeling better? I always carry it with me. When I'm feeling down. Does it bring luck? Yes, it's from happier times. It's desert sand. Helped me a lot today. I'm going to bed. And you should go home. Will we see each other again? I don't even know your name. Good night. It was a pleasure, Alina. Dude, where were you? Moped broken. Moped broken... your head is broken. I was about to call the police. Stop it. Stop it now. A little fag after all, I knew it. Little faggot. Oh my god... Go back to bed. Can't keep those eyes closed, huh? If you ask me... ...cake always does the trick. Delicious? Mhm. Go to bed then. Come on. I'll take you there. Sleep well. Mom, my God. What... I was hungry. Come, come... sit down. -What time is it? -Hm? What time is it? Around five. How nice. You're coming home to your mother early for once? Five in the morning, mom. We were at the wedding, do you remember? I had to clean up. -I don't get it. -What? Well, that it's dead now. I mean, where did it go? If it came from somewhere, then surely, it will go somewhere? Sometimes I'm just scared I'll be gone someday. And that it won't make any difference. You know, I don't want to come from nothing and become nothing. I'm always damn scared of that, man. But being scared is a good thing. Because if you're scared of death now, then you might as well start living. -Hm. -Hm. Man, man, man, you're smart. Mom? Mom! Shit. Fuck. Chanel. Shit. Mom? Mom. Excuse me. Can I help you? Do you understand me? Everything is okay. Hey. Mom. Do you need help? Don't worry, all good. I'm sorry. Take the umbrella. No... thank you. No, we will get you some clothes now. Travelers shall not be stopped. No, no, no. That won't go well. That won't go well. -Open your eyes... hey. -That won't... Enough. Okay? -No. No. -Yes. No. For once, can you tell me what I'm supposed to do? Hm? Come. WATCH OUT. Hey. Hey. -Hi. -Hey. -So? -Okay. I hope you're as hungry as I am?! It's on me. That was the plan. Wait a moment. -Soup, please. -Yes. For two today. Hey, you two cuties. Milli and Vanilli. It's Chinese Soup. The best ever. You always put an egg in. Quail eggs... chicken broth... I'm a vegetarian, you know. It's chicken, not meat. Try it, it's really delicious. Where did you get them from? -My own breed. -Your own breed, huh? -Mhm. -What else are you up to? City guide, pigeon breeder... ...non-swimmer. Yes. Seriously, where are you from? From home. But I was born in Macedonia. What are you up to all day long? Nothing, of course. -Saving money. -What for? So I can buy myself a huge crown someday. When I'm old and grey. -I can't picture that. -Of course. With a long, white, bushy beard. As king of the ravens. What ravens? It's obvious. Ravens are the smartest bird. They use streets to crack nuts. They go with the wolfs... with their brothers and cousins and so on. And bam! They steal their food. They only steal... to make the females happy. Darko! Shit. Alina, sorry,... but I really have to go. Who was that? -The chick next to you that you fed. -Å vabica! None of your business. Man, of course it's my business. Ego-bitch club. I worry about you. Alright, brother. Calm down! Guys, really. Chill out a bit now. Guys, really... Guys. Ey. Ey, look... It's scientifically proven that women get the real hots for a man... if he can dance. Look at me. Look. Hey! Come on, stand up. Guys, let's go, come on. Guys! What's wrong? What's wrong? Guys, really. You could learn something from me. Police. Please open the door. The cops. -Police. Please open the door. -Quick. quick. Because you didn't follow the request... to leave the country voluntarily within the given period... Calm down, mam. Your obligation to leave the country will be enforced... Darko. ...by the Federal Republic of Germany. Please pack your personal belongings. One suitcase per person. Not more than 20 kg. I said, calm down! Calm down, please! Stay quiet! Please! Please! Please let me go! My God. It's all over now. This means trouble. What does it say? Read it, will you. Oh oh. What is it? Are we screwed? No, it's not looking good. It's all over now. Under no circumstances are you to leave the house on the 25th, Chanel. Huh? To enable the service staff to do a meter reading. What? They're coming to read the radiator meters. -Meters? -Mhm. They're coming for the radiator. -Radiator. -Mhm. You villain. You slob. Radiator... Radiator. Chanel... I need your health insurance card again. And then? It will only get worse with Ramona. My doctor received your mom's blood test results... and thinks I'm a medical miracle. I have all illnesses at once: hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia,... I have depression and ADHD. If he sees now that I suddenly have two different blood types as well... You're a darling. My God... I'm sick of the damn Poles. Lewandowski keeps pushing down the price and we can't do anything. We need real cash, man. Because you don't get it. I read, the Mafia uses carrier pigeons as drug... Aha, you can read, yes? Math and German: Always been your three "goodest" subjects, right? What are you laughing about, man? Shut up. Man, the Mafia used carrier pigeons. As couriers for drugs. That's how you make the real money. Risk free. That was smart. And? Huh? What do you do? Trying to impress women. They don't give a shit about your pigeons. Your cash... that's what counts, man. When do you finally get it? Then you're my manager now. Okay, Manolo? Ma-no-lo. Ma-no-lo. Ma-na-ger... I don't give a shit about what you do. Ma-no... Go back to work. We have to finish up. Manolo! Come back here. Back to work, man. Fuck, man. They came for the Africans. I haven't been able to sleep at all since that morning. They will be back. Darko. Wait, wait, wait. What do you even look like, huh? Look at you. You have to look like a neat German. Come here. You have to look like an Almann, you know. Not like an antisocial bum. Now you look great. Manolo! Manolo! Get a move on! -Be careful, guys. -Yeah, man. Hey! Hey! Immaculate, clean and as new. All yours. What now? -Nothing. -Nothing? "Nothing" I don't have. Piss off. S0... Do you manage all of this on your own? Who is your middleman? That's nothing for you. Did you read sign? Look. No dwarfs allowed. I'm not a dwarf. I'm more of a man than this guy. Really? And I'm a dog barber. Just one moment, boss. I have this sick idea. So listen. -Okay? -A hundred. -No. -Why not? Plus 20%, so at least 120. 120. With the booze. Nothing more. Okay. Where is Pavlo? Here, mom. Liar. Liar. -Go. Leave. -Calm down. If your father had wanted you to have it, he would've passed it on to you. I'm sure he would've. What's up? Is Chanel here? Did you put on perfume for my mom, or what? Mom. Food and medication are on the table. Could you please look after her? Do you promise? I'll be back tomorrow evening at the latest. So? How are you? All good? Sweet. Do you want some? No, I'd rather smoke. It's scientifically proven... ...that a woman finds a man... ...sexually attractive... -...if he's a good dancer. -Okay. Gift. Do you want me to spell it out? G... i...ift. Delightful. It's a family heirloom. It's been in our family for hundreds of years. And it's almost only passed on to women because we men don't smoke. I can't. Good thing I didn't propose to you. I would do it right away. -Here and now. -Yes, of course. No. Honeymoon. Bang until we pass out. No escape. And then the divorce. No way. Spontaneity lasts the longest. It doesn't, believe me. Go, take your clothes off. Ey, you're nuts. You have a pretty big mouth for a macho who can't swim. There's this myth, alright. If the... If the ravens fly out of the Tower of London - because they have always been there - So, if they fly away from there, it means bad fortune. A disaster for the Queen. And that's why they always keep a few ravens in cages. Only to calm down the others. And they even cut their wings, so they don't fly away. They simply cut their wings. Well, the... the wing feathers. Really. Cut them off brutally, you know. Bam, and gone. -Come here, you king of ravens. -I can't. I'll watch out for you. Let's go. Stay calm. Stay calm. Let's leave this place. -Yes. -Yes? Only you and me. Yes, us. You're so... naughty. Darko. Come on. That's hot. Hm? Gundel Gaukeley. Seriously. She's hot. You're the woman of my dreams. Seriously. You know me inside out now, right? After three and a half days. Sure. I am your dirty secret. A Macedonian rascal, who bangs you really good! Shh, keep it down. So hot. And fresh. But oh so illegal. That's sexual abuse. I'll report you. Yes. Stop talking bullshit. No bullshit. Do you want me to show you what real shit means? We live like maggots. You know? They crawl through shit. Back... and forth. And when they arrive at the end of the shit... they turn around and crawl back to the other end. And they don't even realize that the shit is never ending. -You don't smell like shit. -Thanks. You know... Women have a thing for whiners. And especially for guys who talk about shit and maggots during sex. I'm not whining. You just keep interrupting me. So... maggots turn into flies. Flies fly away. Away from the shit. Meaning: Flies may not be the most beautiful animals in the world,... but at least they can fly. Yes? Makes sense, right? Where are you getting all of that from? Do you rehearse it or practice in front of the mirror? I don't have a mirror. Alina? Shh. Alina? Hey, there you are. It's alright. I have to work. Why aren't you reading your messages? I haven't heard from you in a week. You simply wake up, go some place, don't tell me when you're back. Excuse me, for wanting to say hello to you properly. Yo... I need you. Dude... I need you now. Right now. Go like this... one, two, three. -Hey. -Wow, dude. This place is a palace. -Yes. Come on now... -Dude, I'm done. Come on, let's go. Wow, dope. What's this, dude? What's this here? Let's bail, now! Chill out, we'll be gone in a second. Dude. What are you doing? I have to pee, man. Man, stop pissing, dude, what... You're such a boar, ey. Who gets bothered by a little piss on the window sill? Me, you monkey. -Yeah, because you're a broad. -Yeah, shut up. So, kids. Come on, we leave now. You can't piss out of the guest house window. -We're leaving. -Please. It's dope here, man. We're leaving, come. We're leaving. Bro, calm down. Take it easy. We just want to have some fun. What is up with you, huh? Dope. What do you have there? Wow, she's hot. Hey bro, that's the Å vabica from the lake. What? Shit, man. How does it work? Let's take a selfie, man. -Come, one selfie and then we leave. -Come, one selfie. -One photo, then we leave. -Yanoosh. Come on, guys. Dope. Come on, let's go. Br... bro, what kind of bullshit is this? -Nothing is visible. -What's up? -There's nothing there. -Shake, you monkey. What? Shake. Shake it. Wow, dude. Magic. Look, dude. That's wicked. Best picture, man. Come on! Yes. Dude, that's how I like it. Come here. Come! Manolo! Yes, give it to me, you stud. Get off, you monkey. Dope, man. Alina. Alina... shit. Alina. Wait. Wait. Wait. You can't bring some random guys over who puke all over the attic. -I don't live alone. -Got it. Nobody puked. You locked me up. I wanted to have you all for myself. You... ...are married. I'm not married. He's my ex. We work together. Always have... Does he provide you with jobs whenever you fuck him? Fuck you. I'm here for you now. And not that dickhead. Yes. Also, he smells like rotten eggs. Hey. What's going on, bro? Digestive issues? No, bro. All good. Same old. We agreed on three chickens. Now I'm only getting one. But it's a highly professional chicken. It looks like it's half dead. It's sensitive... It's mentally preparing to lay eggs. Shit, Schwarzenegro. Fuck. Can you lend me some money? Man, where are you spending your money? Which money? The money from the wedding? Here. For this ugly chick. Where did you steal that from? Ey Chanel, man. Where were you? Leaving me alone with this blood sucker. Vulture. He wants 300 more. He's making a fuss because he had to wait. -I'll give it to you. -He's making a fuss. He's such a godless man. He's really getting on my nerves. Did he drink? He's not drunk, he... He's not drunk, he... My God, he's still a baby. And you too. And you can't even look after him. No respect left. You act like a Å vab. It's because of the German women. German whores. What women? Come, you Satan. It's okay. It's okay? It's perfect. Mh, it's good. 300. And the whiskey. 300, what? Schwarzenegro, come on. We're in Germany here, okay? You have to announce a rent increase in advance here. That's how it works here. Really. Yes. That's how it works here... Kiss the ring... otherwise 400. It's worth at least 400. If you want something exquisite, you have to pay an exclusive price. Between two men of honor. Who wants what, huh? Next month: 800. On time. Otherwise you can pack your bags. I don't believe your mother would enjoy that. I want her to leave. Mom. We didn't do anything wrong. Would you come with me. Korsakov patients can definitely benefit... from a consistent and appropriate treatment. However, in this case we are talking about professional therapy... that would have to be perform ed stationary... at a clinic or a care home. Of course, there'd be an absolute nicotine and alcohol... She's not an alcoholic, my God. That woman has lost everything. Her house was bombed. We've lived in the dirt for years. My only brother died of blood poisoning... because not even the damn ambulance would show up. Alright. Mom. I can't... She needs professional care. -I'm sorry. -You can't manage this at home. No smoke without a fire. Usually, I would have to report this. I can't... I can't breathe. I'll write you a private prescription, okay? We can't afford that. One moment. Chocolate? That's all I can give you. It's the same ingredient. Off you go. This is a prohibited zone. Chill, man. Get out of here. Get lost. Look after the moped. Are you still here? With us? What? Man, sometimes I'm really worried about you, man. Dude, believe me. That chick isn't from this planet. She's not from this place. Believe me, if they catch you, I would lose it completely. I'll wipe them all out. Yeah, man! Who's the boss mechanic here? God of screws and tools. Why is your brother such a vile gorilla, huh? Because I inherited all of it. Beauty, potency, muscles... All of it. Amazing chick, ey. Filming me in bed right on the first time. And doesn't even kiss me when I ask for it? I'm watching my conspecifics... I've seen it already on the thousand pictures of your ex. Kiss impediment. Revenge rascal. Stuffy pea. Catch me. Will you take me to your place sometime? Not possible. You know. You could be blissfully slumbering into your pillow. Then suddenly... ding dong. 3 a.m. at your door. Congratulations, Miss... I don't even know your name. Well... Congratulations, Miss Alina. You have won a great little trip. Direct flight. For free. But immediately. Give me that. Do you see that? That's your life stain. The way it's laid out here... I can see that you're a pretty crazy lady. A coffee puddle here. Do you have a secret you'd like to share with me? I am one big secret. Yes. Because you tell me so much about yourself. Not. You think I don't know how difficult and gruesome life is. Martin had a strong wish. A dream. So strong that his lioness started believing in it too. And... at some point... very late it happened. A miracle grew inside of me. It simply wasn't meant to be. Hey. Sleep tight. I have to go. Don't go. There's one thing I still want to know... What did you say about the coffee grounds again? I was just joking. I still want to know. Alina, I really have to go now. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, please. Stop it. Grab your stuff and piss off. Piss off. Or what, huh? Or what? You showed up after all. He only wants to talk to you. What is it? Show me your face. What kind of world is this, man? The whole town is full of jerks. I will shit on their communion wafers. Hey! Those jerks. You have to say what's wrong. Who did this? You would kill me if I tell you. No, we won't. Promise. -Please, Manolo. -Tell us what's wrong now. That little shit! Come on, stand up. Go, out. Stand up! Stand up. Let's go. What's going on? That's how you want to make money, you little shit? Look at it. You make me sick. Darko, please. I didn't want this to happen. I brought them the pigeons. The Poles laughed at me. It was a fucking trap. They understood it after one pigeon. They tied a pouch to it and I thought to myself: Cool, they get it. The man kept throwing her across the room. She couldn't even fly. She kept falling down again. She was too heavy. And the feathers. Man, shut your mouth, damnit! Darko, they were drunk, man. They wouldn't stop. Darko, I'll make it right, I swear. You want to make it right again? How? Huh? They're dead, don't you get it? You stupid, stupid piece of shit. Darko! Let him go! We were one family. That's all fucked up now. Because of you. I called you a hundred times. Where were you? Where were you? That cunt was more important to you than us. Darius, please. -Darius, stop it! -Take it. Darko, please. You will clip her wings. Darko. Please, I can't do it. Do you want me to show you how? Huh, here. I'll do it then. -Please. -Come on. Darko, please. Piss off. It doesn't look appealing... but it tastes good. Mh, thanks. Darko. Look who's here. Darko. You remember. Marco's daughter. You used to do her homework. What are you doing here? Come on, don't let the girl starve. I really don't want to bother. I'd like to talk to you. Got it. Pretty. Pretty. They steal like ravens. Yes, mom. We will put things back in order, okay. It will all look immaculate here again soon. I am being robbed. Yes, I... I am being robbed. The Ã©tui... Gone. Simply gone. Just like that. You were right. The soup was made with love, you can taste it right away. From now on you will always come to me after school. Yes? You need to eat more. Give me a break and let me search now. I can't always do everything at once. Come. However you managed to be here now... This is for my mother. But at this point... I have to remind her every time that this place still exists. You're not special, you know. I miss them, too, every single day. The night I saved you,... you were the one who saved me. I sat by that lake for a while. No tears left, just... I figured, I'd just jump. With a backpack filled with stones. And it'll all be over. The intervals are getting shorter and shorter. I'm losing her. Perhaps I can look after her some time. It's way too complicated, Alina. You're sleeping with me whenever and however you like it. And with him? I'll go over to her now. Mom? Mom? What's wrong, mom? Someone stood there. Thieves. I'll take a look. You were "the thief", mom. You walked past the mirror too quickly again. Mmmh. I look like a scarecrow. I am a burden to you. You're the love of my life, mother. Oh, mademoiselle. What an honor. Yes. Ey, what's that about? Someone forgot to introduce us. Did you blow him, huh? Did you blow him, huh? Why didn't he introduce us? Do you like this, huh?! Let me go, please. You like this? Let me go! Yanoosh! Run, you whore! Run! What are you doing up there? Fuck each other's asses? What are you doing? That's why you're so weird all the time. Because of this damn Å vabica. -It's not her fault. -Yeah? Yeah? That you have secrets? That you're lying to me? I could never lie to you. You're... ...My brother, man. She's just a fling. Liar. Why are you protecting her then? You should protect me, not her! Darko! Darko. Darko! Stop it. Stop it. Why are you doing that? Stop it! I'm sorry. It's alright. She's taking advantage of you. She's a cunt like any other. She's a cunt. I'm only causing trouble, mom. My God... Let's go. No, no. Don't say that. You're my big boy. And now fly, my birdie. I'm proud of you. I promise, I won't say another word. I'll be back soon, mom. I'll be back tomorrow... Darko. You could be somewhere else by now. But you take us with you. Because you're Darko. Hey. You forgot this. G-i-ift. It's not possible. Let's go away. Darko, I... -Only for a few days. -Darko, I can't. I can't. You wanted to. Darko. Little shit. Darko. Shit! Come with me. Now. I can't. Good day. You must be here because of that little quarrel. Everything is alright. I will apologize to the young man. I will pay a compensation, too. Some music? Makes work a bit nicer. Quite nice. We will have to take you with us. It's a misunderstanding. Let me explain it. Please. Please. -It's okay. -Darko. Darko. Stand up. Come on. Stand up now.
