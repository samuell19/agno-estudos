[light music playing] [zombies moaning, growling] You have to learn to fight for yourself. I won't always be around. Don't say that. Yes, you will. I don't know what I would do without you. You're a strong woman, you take after me. - I do? - [mom] Yes. [sinister music playing] Whoa! Mom! Yes, but this isn't always the most effective weapon. It runs out of bullets. - Where did you get a gun? - It doesn't matter. All right, now, if a horde of zombies comes at you, you got to use everything and anything you can get your hands on to throw at them or bash their brains in. Grab a saucepan like this, hopefully there's some hot grease in there and just swing it at them, just swing it at their head, okay? That's an option, or you can use a knife, okay? But not a serrated one because it will get stuck. You can use this phone cord. You can just grab it, pull it tight, wrap it around the zombie's head, pull and just... just choke him! - Choke him with the phone cord. - Okay. Choke him. That's what you do, that's what you do, honey. - Okay. - Okay. Hang on, there's something else. There's this. - Whoa! - Yes. Just take this and just cut their fucking heads off. Just... Just... Just right over, right through their neck, right through their neck. - Doesn't that need electricity? - Oh, this one runs on gas. That's why I keep the gas can over there. - Oh! - Mm-hmm. - Okay. What about the bottle? - Oh, shit, that's for me. It's for my nerves, you know, it is the apocalypse. [gulping] [Andrea] Oh, okay. [gulping] Ah, that works. [inhales] Come here, listen, repeat after me. Okay? I am a strong woman. I am a strong woman. - I am a strong woman. - I am a strong woman. - One more time. - I am a strong woman. Yes! I am a strong woman. [Marcus mumbling] [Doris] Hey. [exhales] [Doris sighs] - [Marcus] Oh. - Ah. [giggles] [indistinct chatter from TV] [suspenseful music playing] - [mom] Andrea. - I'll be there in a second. - [music continues] - [burner clicks] [mom] Andrea, Thanksgiving meal. [Andrea] You leave the stove on all the time. [giggling] I'm gonna miss the show. [indistinct chatter from TV] [mom] Hey, maybe I'm gonna bash some zombies' brains... But, Timmy, why are you eating my food? - [Frank] Guys. - Hmm? [sighs] I want to watch the zombie show with Doris and Marcus! They always get to watch it without me. [door opens] What do you think? Not bad for canned food for Thanksgiving dinner. Thanksgiving lunch, and why don't we go to the beach like we always do as a family? - [sighs softly, clicks tongue] - [can thuds] We can't. It's not safe at the beach. [humming] - Ow! [grunts] - [giggles] [Andrea] I miss Dad. [sighs] [mom] Let's say a prayer, shall we? Shall we? Mm-hmm. Dear Father in Heaven, we thank you for your blessings and your graces. We thank you for our food, shelter, and health, and we especially thank you for our family during this apocalypse. We thank you for... No phones at the table, please. - Can you put the volume up, please? - [Frank's hand slams] Mom, turn it down. - [mom] Andrea, stay out of my closet. - [giggles] [Andrea] Just 'cause the world's ending doesn't mean I have to ask you "please." [giggles] Damn it! One bar. Look, I understand your need to feel connected, but I am right here and there's nothing more important than spending time with your family during the Thanksgiving meal. Thanksgiving lunch, and Dad is dead. Don't you dare talk about your dad like that! I will talk about my father whenever I want! Don't sass me, young lady! - You go to your room! - I will go to my room because I want to charge my phone! And don't come out until you've apologized! I'm not gonna apologize! And don't break everything like you did last time. - [mom] I'll break whatever I want, bitch! - [door slams] [sighs] [growling] [suspenseful music playing] [mom gasping] [grunting] [grunting] - Yes! - [mom] Ah! Ah! Yes! [shouting] [laughing] [grunting] - Yes, yeah. - Doris, you're in the way. I can't see the TV. [groaning] [coughing] [screaming from TV] Doris? [gasping] Doris? Doris, are you okay? [groans, wheezes] Doris? [sad music playing] Frank? Frank? Something's wrong, Frank. Frank! Frank, something's wrong with Doris! Frank! [mom screaming on TV] Andrea! Andrea! [screaming continues] [screaming echoes] [wind blowing] [birds chirping] [sobbing] If you can hear me, I'm going to miss you, Doris. I'm gonna miss you. Bye. [sniffles] [sobs, yells] Can we pray? Sure. Lord, we miss Doris and we ask that you send her to watch over us tonight and help us have good dreams. - Amen. - [Marcus] Amen. Can you tuck me in? Marcus, you're 23 years old. - [sighs] - I miss her. [somber piano music] You still got me. We're family. We're all God's children. Brothers and sisters. Do zombies have families? - [laughing] - Hmm. Yes. 'Cause Jesus rose from the dead. - Yes, Jesus was a zombie. - [gasps] - He was? - [Frank] Yes. Frank, can you leave the light on? Sure. Good night, Marcus. Good night, Alfredo. [light music playing] [birds chirping] [sizzling] All right, guys. Fresh hot eggs. Here you go, Timmy. There we go. Marcus, there's something for you there. Zombie brains. [squirts] Gunshot. [growling] [stammers] Timmy, Doris isn't here anymore, Timmy. She's gone. Shut up! Guys! Calm down. Hurry up. Your day program is waiting. [upbeat music playing] [Frank] Go to the program. When you come back, you can watch another episode. There's a big marathon on tonight. - All right? - [Marcus] Okay. All right. All right, let me look at you. That's what Mom would want. All right, let me see you. It's good. I like the tie and green T-shirt. Thanks, Frank. All right, have a good day. - Andrea! - [growls] - [oil sizzles] - [yells] - [grunting] - [sizzles] - [groans] - [screams] Andrea? Andrea! Andrea! [growling] Andrea! - Mom, are you okay? - Andrea! Mom? - [growling] - [grunts] Mom! Mom! Mom! [screams] [growling] [screams] - [growling] - [panting] [suspenseful music playing] I gotta charge my phone. Did I hear you say you like brains? Yeah, I like brains. - 'Cause I'm Captain Kill. - I got brains in a capsule form. Oh, well, then, give it to the specimen. Oh, no! [growling] [growling] - Marcus! - [groans] [coughing] I thought I lost you. [clears throat] Marcus, Frank. Hi, Nicole. Nicole. I see you're still doing the zombie thing. Yeah, I, uh, Captain Kill made me take my medication, see? Captain Kill? Nice, Frank, that's really nice. So, let's get started, okay? It's been a long time since my last visit, clearly. We need to talk about your behaviors. We need to discuss your goals. I want a chainsaw like Captain Kill. Okay, no, you can't have a chainsaw. Anything else? I want to spend Thanksgiving with my mama. Wait, what? I want to spend Thanksgiving with my mama to watch the last episode of Apocalyptic Zombies and have Thanksgiving lunch. Do you even know your mother's name? It's Mama. We'll see, Marcus, but the information I have is probably out of date. You may not be able to have Thanksgiving dinner with her. Thanksgiving lunch. Okay, well, have a happy Thanksgiving, Marcus, and I will see you in three months. And, Frank, I'm sorry about your mother. - I'll miss Doris. - [door opens] Well, I can... I can get a job at the laundromat with Kim so I can make enough money to earn a ticket to see my mama. [chuckles] Whoa, man, to join my family has an initiation fee of 23 years hard labor. Bills are free, though. Kim, can I get a job at the laundromat? [chuckles] Is he serious? Ah... [Marcus] Thank you, Kim! Thank you, Kim! Thank you, Kim! [Frank] Marcus. Sign out. I'll see you for dinner. Kim! Kim, what... what's it... What's it like to have a family? Do you sing songs together at the dinner table? [chuckles] No. Dude, I sleep away at the "laundry mat" in between classes. I basically don't have a life. - Yeah, me neither. - What are you talking about? Frank cooks and cleans for you. You're free to do whatever you want. - Did you get everything? - Yeah, I got everything. Yeah, you certainly do. So does your mom sing songs for you before you go to bed? Dude, what is it with you and singing? You know what? Yes, yes, she does sing to me. She sings to me, "Why don't you work harder? Ah! My back!" All accompanied to the soothing mechanical rhythm of washer-dryers. "Ah! My back. Ice! My back." [laughter] Is that... is that a Korean song? I think I've heard it before. [Kim sighs] - Throw the laundry in. - Kim, is this your car? Yep. - Can I... can I ride in it? - Yeah. - Can I ride in the front seat? - Yep. Let's go. [Marcus] Okay. Hey, Nicole. He needs stability. He has mental illness and developmental disabilities. Yeah, and I think he's got grand delusions and hallucinations in there as well. [sighs] - I mean, don't we all? - Yeah. I'm gonna double check his file and I'll be back. Have a blessed day, Frank. [Kim] So this is our "laundry mat." Um... Oh, I have to let you know that my dad's something a little old-fashioned, so... [Marcus] Is he like a dinosaur? [Kim] Kind of, yeah, pretty much in a sense. You'll get it when you meet him, really kind of... Marcus? Marcus, hey. - [upbeat music playing] - [machine whirring] Marcus, hey, focus. - Come on, let's go. Come on, this way. - Wha... okay! - You want a job, right? - Yeah, I want a job. Okay, then you need to follow me. Come on. - Okay. - Back here. The office is over here. I'll introduce you to my dad. Yo, Dad, um, I found you some help. Are you serious? - Marcus, hey, give me the... - Hey, I'm Marcus. I'm your new worker. Kim, what are you doing? Hey, you're always telling me that you need extra help and he could clean the dumpster area. If he does a really good job, I mean, eventually, he could maybe take over for me. - Can you clean dumpsters? - Yes, I can clean dumpsters. He can clean dumpsters, there you go. All right, I'll leave you two at it. - Kim! Kim. - Marcus you be good. I'll see you at home, okay? Bye! Bye, Kim. - Don't touch that. - [Marcus] Okay. - Follow me, please. - Okay. [Marcus] All the garbage? - It's all the garbage. - [dog barking] [grunts softly] - [barking continues] - [garbage thudding] [grunts] [grunts] [growling] - [clanging] - [grunting] [panting] [bicycle bell dings] [Marcus] Is it Bambi? Candy? Daisy? Is it Paris? No, those are the names on the Apocalyptic Zombies show. I must know my mama's name. I... I must know their names. Wow! You did a great job, Marcus. Thank you. I've got something for you. Hold on a second. Okay. All finished. Wow, what is this? This is your knapsack. You can sit here and hang out and read zombie comics, all day. This is my favorite one. Marcus, why are you in a group home? - 'Cause I ain't got nobody. - That's bad English. "I have no one" or "I don't have anyone." Say it. I don't have anyone. Better. - Can you count money? - Yes. I mean, no. It's too bad. I might have had a job for you. I... I... I can learn! I can, I can learn how to count. I can learn how to count. Come back when you're ready. Okay, I'm ready. Oh! Now I'm ready. No, you can't just drop this information on him. We are not dropping information on him, we are doing our jobs. - But you have to prep him first. - Prep him or deprive him? 'Cause that's exactly what you're doing. - No, I want him to know too. - Then tell him. Hi. Hey, Nicole. Hi, Marcus. Uh, you, you look... You look pretty, like a flower. Marcus, your mother is in Lompoc Prison. [sighs] [sentimental music playing] Oh, I know where my mom is! I know where my mom is! I know where my mom is! I know where my mom is! Thanks. [music continues] [sighs] [Marcus] No, no, you need toothpaste, weirdo. There you go. All right. Not too hard, not too hard. Little circles, little circles. There you go. If you brush too hard, you'll hurt yourself and you end up having to be on pills the rest your life, like these. - [school bell rings] - Good morning, Miss Smith. [Mrs. Smith] Marcus, where did you get these drugs from? I found them on the floor. Don't lie to me, Marcus. People don't leave bad drugs like these lying around on the floor. I'm not lying. I found them on the floor. That's it. You're suspended. Frank's waiting for you outside. [thudding] [sighs] Hey, where's Kim at? He's not here. [Paco] I said where's Kim at, yo? [Jung] Kim's not here. Please leave. This is for customers only. What you gonna do about it, dawg? Huh? [Jung] I said please leave. Those security cameras ain't shit. No red light. Hey, I know you. Come here. You got me kicked out of school. Come here. I'ma kick his butt. - Yeah, let me out. - I'm telling Luis, man. Yeah, you go tell Luis, dorsal fin. You want to go to jail? You can't go around hurting people. But he was going to kick your butt. I know, but sometimes you gotta forgive people, - even if they wanna hurt you. - Everybody? Yeah, sometimes even your family. But I ain't got no family. You want to join us for dinner tonight? Yes, sure, yeah. All right. - Welcome to my house. - This is your house? - Yeah. - What? Smells delicious! - Thanks. - I brought a guest. Hi. Marcus? What are you doing here. I made a lot of money today. [Jung] You did. You worked hard. Yeah, I worked my butt off. [Jung] Yeah. I worked so many hours. [Jung] I love that comic book place, that bed thing that you made. [Marcus] Yeah, it was hard work. [Jung] You worked hard. Yeah, I had to use all my muscles. You did. He was a great help. I was really impressed. [Marcus] It's all for you, best friend. - [chuckles] Thank you. - Yeah! I made so much money today. Jung, who's this? This is Marcus. He saved me from the gang bangers. Yeah, I'm the hero this town deserves. Dad, why didn't you just hide in the office? Why didn't you fix the security cameras like you promised? [exhales] Welcome to the reality television show, The Koreans of South Central L.A., starring my family, the Parks. [cutlery scrapes] Marcus, what are you grateful for? I don't have anything to be grateful for. You sound like my son. Oh, I know what to be grateful for. - I'm grateful for my mama. - [somber music playing] She's at Lompoc Security Prison. I want to have the most apocalyptic Thanksgiving lunch with her. But Frank won't drive me down there. - Who's Frank? - [Kim] Um... You know you don't need Frank to take you, right? It's only $167 round trip to the prison. Apparently too much for my parents to afford to come and visit me, but, hey, you can have dinner with your mom. Kim! Is this enough? - [Marcus] Oh! Oh. - Marcus. Marcus. - Yeah? - I made a chart for you. Five of these pennies make a nickel. Yeah. - Two nickels make... - That's a dime. [Jung] That's a dime, right. Two dimes and a nickel make a quarter. - You know what a quarter is? - Yes, I know what a quarter is. Right, so, four quarters make a dollar. And everything in the laundromat costs a dollar. So take this chart - and practice. - Okay, yeah. And then you'll know how to count money. [indistinct chatter] A dollar for every time someone says thank you. I call it my mustard seed money tree. This is our secret, okay, Marcus? [speaking in Korean] Oh! My show's on. - I guess you could watch it on my computer. - Okay. Just sit down right here. - All right, have a good show. - Wait. Don't go. Watch it with me. - [suspenseful music playing] - [crow caws] [Andrea] Hello? [growling] Oh! Yes! - It's charging. - [growling] [screams] [music continues] Frank lets you watch this? Oh, they're just zombies, and it helps me sleep at night. [Andrea] Hello? Anybody here? [sighs] [sighs] [inspirational music playing] I am a strong woman. I am a strong woman. I am a strong woman! - I... - Quiet! - What? - They can hear you. Who? Oh, that's nice. Found a good friend. First rule of the zombie apocalypse is, don't let the enemy know your whereabouts. What's with the bandana? You look like a mini Rambo. You don't want to get caught doing a picture-perfect ninja move and then blood gets in your eyes. You get infected. Come on, this is a zombie apocalypse. [sighs] All my mom would do is non-stop chatter about the apocalypse as if it's the most important thing in the world. [crow calling] You just told me to be quiet. Shh! I'm signaling for my father. - Who told you? - What? [crow calling] The bomb shelter. It was our idea to raid the bomb shelter while everybody was stuffing their face for Thanksgiving dinner. Thanksgiving lunch, and I'm supposed to meet my girlfriends here. God, where are they? I don't know who this bozo is, but I hope he can kill zombies. Family that slays together stays together. [sizzling] You okay? I'm okay. - Good morning. - [sighs] How you doing today, son? Great, great. Yeah, been drug free for like five whole minutes, staying strong. You paid Marcus. Did you raise the prices? I had to pay him. If I can teach him how to count, maybe we can hire him full-time. Besides, I'm good at teaching people who have problems learning. Oh, you mean me. [chuckles] Really, you're going to compare me to a guy who has special needs? I cooked you breakfast and studied for my calculus exam at the same time. Can he do that? Hmm? No, no, I didn't think so. Kim, one, parents, zero. What up? I think you're on drugs now. [inhales] Only uppers. It's too early for downers right now. Enough! Geez, Kimmy! [groans] [screams] [suspenseful music playing] [groaning] Mom, are you okay? Damn. What did I tell you about eating so much junk food? Now you're just too big to make it upstairs. [chuckles] No mother deserves to be spoken to like that. Marcus, help me upstairs. No, no, here, I was kidding. I'll help you. No! Turn around, Marcus. Okay. [groaning] - You okay? You ready? Okay. - [groans] - [Me Young] Oh. - There we go. Let's go. [sentimental music playing] One at a time. [stairs creaking] - Don't drop me. - [Marcus] Okay. [groans] Okay. You all right? Yeah. [sniffs] - Okay. - [exhales] You're gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah. - All right. [emotional music playing] Oh, man. What the hell are you doing in my room? What happened to you? Do you mind? Okay. Look, um, when I was in prison, I saw my mom. She was nagging the whole time. Nag, nag... Yeah, yeah, in prison. I thought I was going crazy. I couldn't tell anybody and they would have put me in some straight jacket and throw me in an asylum. It wasn't actually until rehab that I realized how much pain I had caused my family. And then, poof. Just like that she was gone. Look, this stays between you and me, all right? Okay. [stammers] Don't hug me. - Now get the hell out of my room. - Oh, okay. Girl, you got a major hickey! Are you kidding? They're really zombies. I'm serious. - Whoo, they smell really bad. - Let me explain something to you. - They're zombies. Zombies bad. - Oh! - Go! - Oh, oh! [suspenseful music playing] And then he was getting lava poured all over him and he was burning, but then, the... the baker zombie came out and he said, "Get that boy out of there." And then he grabbed him and took him out of the lava - and then snapped his neck. - [grunts, imitates neck snapping] And then... and then season six ended in a cliffhanger, so I don't know what happens next. What is your obsession with zombies? They are disgusting and that is why you have violent behavioral episodes. - [emotional music playing] - [dog barking] - Thanks, Nicole. - [grunts] [barking continues] - He's gonna go nuts. - Then sell the business. I can't sell the group home. I grew up with some of them. - They're like my family. - We're here to serve the clients, not institutionalize them. What kind of a relationship do you think he can have? You just want the money, don't you? Frank! Nicole! I need help. I need to decide which zombie my mom would want to see. Should I show her this one or... Or should I show zombie Steve Jobs? You're a mama, you should know. I'll see you tomorrow, Marcus. Nicole? N-Nicole! You didn't give me an answer. - [Nicole] I will see you tomorrow, Marcus. - I just wanted... [engine starts] - I like that one. - I like it too. Thanks, Frank. I gotta go. Bye. [Me Young sighs] Can you work another night to give your father a break? Why can't you do it? You're feeling better, aren't you? - [both] My back! - [Kim snorts] Okay, fine, if your back hurts so much, why don't you go see an acupuncturist or something? I mean, it's like you're pretending your back hurts even more to make me feel guilty. Okay, then take me now. No, I can't just take you n... You can't just spring something like this on me out of nowhere. - I have plans. - Hey, I can take you. And don't you have to be somewhere? Yeah, I got a hot set of wheels out front. - Hot set of wheels? - Yeah. Hot set of wheels. Yeah, it's nice, it's comfy, it seats two people, if you count the driver, and it's really easy to get around. - What's an, uh, an acu... - An acupuncturist. - Yeah, what's an acupuncturist? - A doctor for my back. I overworked myself for Kim. Well, Kim works so hard, he doesn't even have time to watch Apocalyptic Zombies with me. He abandoned his responsibilities while he was in prison and left us alone. - Why do you yell at him so much? - Because I care. Like, Kim's so nice. [Me Young] Just take me to the acupuncturist, okay? So, tell me about the hospital. Pretty nice or bad? - It was bad. - It was bad. So at the hospital people were given drugs, right? Yeah. What if the people didn't want to take drugs? They strap you down and force them down your throat. [emotional music playing] Morning, noon, and night. One time, these twins were given a lobotomy. I could hear them screaming all night long. There was pus oozing from the stitches on their ears and their eyes. They were wearing hockey masks. Wait, what hospital are you talking about? Are you talking about the hospital you were in? [stammers] Oh, no, that was... That was the hospital on Apocalyptic Zombies. No, the hospital I was at was nice. I liked it. I never wanted to leave. [Andrea] Do you even own a shotgun? [chuckles] Too easy. There's so many ways you can kill them. You could trip them and, uh, smash their heads into the floor. You could, uh, behead them with a ninja sword. You could take their limbs and shove them into a trash compactor. And then, and then, you have the mother of all weapons, which is the chainsaw. It's good for close range, and you can... [grunts] [laughs] All right, let's see what we have here. Not bad. How many ways can you behead a zombie? You can behead them. - That's one. - You can strangle them. - [Jung] Strangle them. - I love zombies. Me too! I love... [growling] How do you kill zombies? Oh, you electrocute them! You can starve them to death, but they don't really die of starvation. - Their flesh just rots off. - Well, how many is that? [Marcus] Oh, you put them in the microwave. You can take a broom and you can take the... [grunts] ...handle and... [mumbles] - Ah! - Choke them. - Choke them. - Bang their head in. - [Jung] Bang their heads. - You can mess up - their credit rating. - [Jung] That's fine, keep going. That was a good broom! Oh, you throw them in the water. Sometimes it's not the zombies you need to look out for. He's not fun. No, you can't forget the chainsaw. [imitates chainsaw noises] If there's an apocalypse, you wouldn't have electricity. Gasoline. That makes 22. You're getting it. You got it. I got it! Yeah! - Oh, let me help you. - No, no, no, let me finish. [Kim] Mom? - Me Young, you're doing it! - [chuckles] [Marcus] She's doing it, Kim! [Me Young] Okay. [chuckles] [cheering] - Sorry. - Careful, I'm still sore. - I'm sorry. - How did this happen? Marcus took me to the acupuncturist. - Good job, Marcus. - [Marcus] You're welcome. Hey, hey, um, uh, uh... I'm sorry about what happened in the laundromat earlier. Jung said I can't go around hurting people and I hope I didn't hurt you. You didn't hurt nobody, man. I am Paco. I roll with Luis, yo. Okay, so we're cool? Yeah, we good, dawg. Whoa! What's that? [Paco] My homeboy Luis. Oh, that's cool. [imitates whining] Oh! So what are you doing here, yo? I'm trying to earn some money. Wanna make some real money? Right, follow me. [rock music playing] Oh! Why didn't you kill them? I saved you. You can go now. Wait, wait, where are you going? Why are you following me? My mom was burned alive, I can't find my friends, and my phone is dead. You may be a fashion risk, but you're all I've got. I'm Andrea, by the way. [suspenseful music playing] - What? - [zombies groaning] Uh, you should kill them. - Kill them? - Uh-huh. Kill them. [screams] When I stuck my hand up her shirt, I pulled her guts out... [rock music playing] This shop right here. - Tattoo. - [Luis] Oh, Paco. - What's up, dawg? - What's up, yo? It's good, man. - Who's this? - [Paco] Hey, it's cool, it's cool. Hey, you're the guy on Paco's tattoo. That's right. See these tats? They represent blood brothers for life and who's got your back when everything goes down. Do you guys sell drugs? [chuckles] Do we sell drugs? This guy. He goes to that special school. Oh! We don't sell drugs. [laughs] Drugs bad. Yo, he's retarded, not deaf. No, no, you have mental retardation, you aren't retarded. There's a difference. See, Alfredo, Alfredo is retarded. Yo, he could be our muscle, man. They ain't gonna put special people like him in prison. I took the test and I passed 'cause I'm too smart. [Luis] You were supposed to fail, stupid. So you don't go to juvie. Huh. Wanna make some easy coin? I just want to earn enough to see my mama. See your mama? Yeah. Hmm. Tell you what, why don't you join our family? You can make all the money you want, see your mama all the time. What do you say? [upbeat music playing] Go ahead, Marcus. Welcome to the crib. [chuckles] Yeah. - [Marcus] Hi, Luis. - [Luis] Come on down, man, have a seat. - [Marcus] Okay. - [Luis] What's up, Paco? All right? How are you doing, Marcus? Whoa, whoa, whoa, sit down, sit down. - [Marcus] Okay. - [Luis] Let's get comfortable. Mi casa es su casa. Check this out. - Like what you see, Marcus? - Do you work out? There she is. She does more than work out. - Hey, baby. - She's pretty. [Luis] Yes, she's pretty. Why don't you turn around for him, baby, show him what you got? See that. She's a ballerina! [Luis] Yeah, she's a ballerina! - Yeah, I'm a ballerina. - Sit down, baby! Baby, I want you to get to know Marcus over here. - Hi, I'm Marcus. I'm 23 years old. - [chuckles] I'm sure nobody messes with you, tells you what to do, right? Right. Do you know what "hermano" means? - No. - It means brother. You want to be my brother, Marcus? You want to protect little old Sophia from the bad guys? Sure, I'll be your brother. Maybe we can make a little bit of money. You want to make some money? Okay. Are you ready to be part of the family? Family is everything. That's right. Mi hermano. It looks good on you. You know? You wanna go for a swim? I don't have any swim trunks. It's okay, I'm sure the boys got something. Right, Luis? Okay. Uh, Sophia has a jiggly butt. Sophia has a jiggly butt. [mouthing words] Come on, come on. [chuckles] Can you believe this guy? [chuckles] Yo, check this out, yo. - Yeah, get him. - [Paco] Hey, punk! - Where's my money at? - I don't got your money! [Paco] You hear this fool? Your own people are stopping you from seeing your mama. They're not your family. - Get him! - This chump? [growling] What? Punk. Yeah. That's right, boy. It's all good. You got this, man, you got this. So get some new swag, yo. You got this. Let's go before the cops come. Let's go. [door opens] [door closes] The next time you stay out this late, I'm calling the police. I've killed lots of zombies before. Lots of them. - [footsteps thudding] - [TV mutes] Did you even hear what I just said? Go make me something to eat, dawg. - When? - [man] Uh, last summer. Have you been drinking? [Andrea] So, you've actually gone all the way and killed them. [laughs] So, uh, why didn't you kill them if they were zombies? [man] Because. You know, I've killed lots of zombies before. Lots of them. You just lost your weekly allowance. Let's see a photo... [Nicole] You blew it. Gang clothes, Frank? He has the right to wear whatever he wants. Somebody else gave it to him. Oh, Marcus, Marcus they're really loud. - Shush! - And he's moving - to another facility. - What?! - You can't just do that! - No, Marcus. They're yelling and they're really mad! - Shush! Shush! - I have to go. I can't afford to lose a client. He needs more attention and another psych evaluation. There's nothing wrong with him. He wants to be with his mother. Bye, Marcus. I want to be with my mother, but she passed away. There's nothing psychologically wrong with me. Shit. Marcus, meds. We're a family and we have to take care of one another. I have the right to refuse medication. And you also have the right to be homeless where you have no family. [cup clatters] Hey, show me. [retching] [emotional music playing] Mama, I want to see you again, but I don't... I don't think you'll remember what I look like. I've changed a lot, Mommy, and I hope you can still remember me, because I... I still love you like I used to. I'm... I'm trying to raise enough money so I can come see you. [stammers] But I'll be there. We can... we can have Thanksgiving lunch and watch Apocalyptic Zombies together. [hip-hop music playing] - Go make us a drink. - Okay. Paco! Marcus, check this out, man. - You ever seen one of these? - Yeah, it's a pistol. I want you to be protected like a man. - Whoa, yo, chill, chill, chill! - He's all right. Oh, no, no, no, that can't go in there. - Why not? - The colors with colors. But if you put the wrong piece of clothing in the wrong place, it could ruin the entire laundry. Well, well, well, look who's back. Hey, Luis. You think you can do me a favor and hook some up? [chuckles] Hook some up? You still owe me. Kim. Kim, we gotta go to the bus station. I got enough money to see my mama. And where'd you get the money, Marcus? Oh, I got it from... From Jung's office. There's a big safe with all kinds of money. - Marcus, shut up. - Oh, yeah? - Let me see it. - [Marcus] Okay. With all this money, you can stab them, cut them... Let me see that. [Marcus] Hey, that's my money! Very good. Uh. Ouch. You know what? Your debt's clear with me, Kim. There you go. Now get out of here. - Come on, Marcus. - No, no, no, no, I want to talk to Marcus. You go. Get out, go. [sighs] Damn it. [melancholic music playing] - What are you doing? - Oh, shit! Um... [clears throat] Look, Dad, I... I know what this looks like, but all I'm trying to do is put the money - in the bank for you. - Are you on drugs? You don't understand. Luis knows where this money is. I don't care who Luis is. Just take your stuff and go. - You're not listening... - Leave us alone! Life was better when you were in prison. Just go! Just go! Go! [sighs] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music playing] [plane whooshing] - [syringe clatters] - [sighs] This is a gun! All you do is cock it back, put this, and then bam! You're dead. Does that make sense? Uh, this is yours, I want to make sure that we're cool, that, uh, you got what you need and, uh, we don't have a problem. [Marcus] What up? You think you're tough, huh? You think you're tough? I'm someone. Nobody messes with me. Nobody. [chuckles] I'm sure nobody messes with you. Tells you what to do. I said don't you mess with me! I got the gun! - [Frank] You're late. - Hey, I know you. You got Paco in a headlock. [Luis] So what you gonna do? That's not the way it went down at, uh... You know, killing your first one will give you special powers, yeah. What about this, man? Huh? [gunshot] [dramatic music playing] Who's... Who's retarded? Marcus, what are you doing with that gun? Luis gave it to me. He said that if I keep this gun on me, no one will mess with me. Give me that gun. You could get hurt, you could hurt someone, you could go to jail! No, it's not dangerous. I'm not gonna hurt you. Don't point that gun at me. - I'm not gonna hurt you! - Give me that gun. I'm... Uh, I'm sorry. Uh. I didn't mean to scare you. Can I have the gun back? I'm giving this gun to Frank. [whimpers] Luis said if I don't give the gun back, he might come after me. Don't ever bring that gun back in here again. I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Gangs have brought nothing but misery in our family. [Luis] All right, come on, let's pick out a tat. [Marcus] Okay. [Luis] Scroll through there. Uh, that one? Relax. [electronic music playing] [Luis] All right. Shh. It's all right. Marcus, I want you to do us a favor. The Korean family, they've been taking advantage of us poor people for years. Now they're going to raise the prices. - [tattoo machine whirring] - [whimpering] Hey, you're all right, all right. Come on, calm down. It's okay. I'm right here with you, buddy. - [whirring resumes] - [grunts] That's all right, that's all right, come on. Think about it like this: when the apocalypse comes, do you think it's fair that that family's gonna hold their supplies and not share 'em with you? - Come on. - [groans] [groans] [melancholic music playing] [squeaks] Adiós, dawg. [horns honking faintly] [piano music playing] Have you seen this man? He's one of our clients. [no audible dialogue] [suspenseful music playing] [sniffles] [growling] [growling] [growling] [growls] [growling] [Marcus screams] [growling] [Marcus screams] [panting] [growling] [screams] - [growls] - [screaming] Marcus! What are you doing? What are you doing? Here. Hi, it's Me Young. Come on, let me get you inside. Come on. - Breakfast is served. - Marcus? Yo, man, you're wearing my apron. - And where is... - Mom and Dad? What did you say? Mom and Dad? They went for a walk. Mmm, what smells so good in here? - It's all right. - How'd you sleep, Marcus? Whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on. You were letting him move in? - He was sleeping on the porch. - I don't care. - He's... He's taking over my life. - You jealous of Marcus? What? Are you jealous of a kid with special needs? You mean a retard! Kim, get back in here! Come on, Marcus, I'll take you to the laundromat. Okay. [dryers whirring] Sure. You'd be dead if it weren't for me. You'd be dead. Yeah, I don't like that guy, anyway. [Jung] Ooh, there goes his left arm. [Marcus] Oh, I didn't like him. [Jung] It's crazy. It's like spreading all over. Hey, did you see I fixed the security camera? - Yo, Dad. - That's... that's... that's good. - Andrea's gonna die. - [Marcus] Oh, no! [Andrea] Oh! Oh! [Marcus] They're gonna do a zombie hat dance. Really? Really, you two? It's just a TV show. You know what? Forget it. Yeah, yeah, you two go ahead, hang out here, best friends, and I'm gonna go back to work and... All the zombies are circling her. Uh-oh! [mumbling] Same damn thing. Marcus, I was worried about you. Hey, calm down! You're keeping me away from my family. Hey, if we leave now, there's still time - to catch Apocalyptic Zombies. - No! [growling] Marcus, we're a zombie family. - We gotta stay together. - Zombies don't have families! Frank, can I see you outside, please? You know Marcus is safe with us, right? He's like family. You can't take him home with you. He's not like a pet. Of course he's not a pet. Why didn't you just lock him up, then? You can't lock him up, it's against their God-given right to be free. That's why they're not in an institution. He's a child's tantrum inside a giant's body. What are you talking about? - Marcus. - What?! [snorting] - I've never seen him like that before. - He's got to be off his meds. - Is he dangerous? - Yes, that's why I came down here to tell you you're not safe. [indistinct chatter] Where did everybody go? They left me. Oh, I'm sure they're around somewhere. [man sniffing] - Here's to Thanksgiving Day lunch. - Wow! [growling] What? [growling] - Uh... - What are you looking at? Uh... - Dad! You're alive. - Dad? - This is my dad. - No, that's a zombie. He's not a zombie, he's just drunk. He does this all the time, stumbles around... Oh, God, Andrea, run. He's a zombie! [screaming] [scream echoes] Marcus, what happened? Do you know why I am in a group home? Why? She said he took one look at me and left. - Marcus. - I took a hose... pushed her against the wall, - and beat her with it. - Marcus. - [Marcus] What... - [growling] - Marcus, Marcus... - The cops... - They took her away from me. She never came to see me. - [growling] - It's okay, Marcus. - No one wants me! - Marc... Marcus! - [dramatic music playing] Nicole just called. She'll be here in the morning. Thanks, buddy. - [growling] - [screams] Oh! [screaming on TV continues] [show pauses] You shouldn't be here. I'm sorry, I need one more... I need to work one more day. I'm... I'm gonna get kicked out of my group home. Marcus, you threw me down on the ground. You hurt me. [stammers] I'm sorry. But you told me I need to forgive everybody. Yeah, I guess I did say that. All right, let's go do the money chart one more time, see what you remember. [suspenseful music playing] [growling] [Jung] Four quarters make? [whispers] There he is. Marcus, what's wrong? Are you okay? Yo! [groaning, grunting] [Marcus] No. - Where's the safe at, Marcus? - I don't know. - Where is it at? - I don't know! - Where is it at?! - I don't know! - [gasping] - Oh, you think I'm playing? Huh? Do you think I'm playing? [screaming] - Tell me now or I'll kill him. - Okay, I'll tell you. You ain't gonna tell me, you'll show me. Okay, okay. [Jung groans] [Marcus] It's... it's here. Don't hurt me. - Oh, please! - [Luis] Come on, man, there's the safe. Paco, watch the door. - Come on. Let's go. - [whimpers] - Come on, man, open the safe. - Okay, okay! Oh. - [whimpering] - What's the matter? I'm trying. Give me a second, give me a second. - You think this is a game? You'd better try harder. - No! I'm not playing with you, Marcus. Open the safe. I'll put a bullet right through your head. - Open it! Get down. - Okay, okay. Okay. - Open the safe. You got five seconds. - [whimpering] Um... Uh, uh... 82nd episode, um... - 33 survivors. - [Luis] Three... [whimpers] - Two... - It's 47 zombies. [Luis] One... - I'll shoot you, Marcus. - Oh, no, okay, it's open. Yes! - Come on, you did good. - [Marcus] Okay. Look at this! Get your money on that, come on, that's your money too! Come on, come on, come on. Go. Let's go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Come on, come on. [machines whirring] [ominous music playing] Dad? Dad, Dad, Dad? No, no, no, no, no! Dad, Dad, Dad. What happened? Dad? Dad, wake up! Dad. Hold on, Dad. Just hold on! - [upbeat music playing] - Whoo! [cheering] [indistinct chatter] [ringing] - Hi! - Mom! Mom! - [Me Young] Yeah? - Something's happened to Dad at the laundromat. I don't know what's going on! - He won't wake up. - What? - There's blood and I... - Okay, okay. I called an ambulance. Just get over here, please. Okay, okay, I'll be right there. Bye. [sobbing] Appa! [sobs] Marcus... Please, Dad! [man] Hey! [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [chatter continues] Hey, what are you doing? Hey, come here! Come here! - Are you disrespecting me? - Why are you fucking pushing me like that? - Why are you dancing on him? - That's what you want me to do, right? - Huh? - Quit playing with me. Huh? What I want you to do: I don't want you disrespecting me no more. - Get the fuck off me. - That's disrespecting me. - [Sophia gasping] - [Marcus groans, grunts] [indistinct chatter] Looks like Marcus cares about me more than you. - Oh, you like that? - Makes you mad, doesn't it? [screams] Get off me, fucker. - [chatter continues] - [sobbing] - [music continues muffled] - [Luis] Sophia! Fuck her, man. Yo, get this money, man. [sobbing continues] [birds chirping] [door opens] [indistinct PA chatter] [mellow music playing] [door creaking] Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Take the money. Take the money. Take it, take it, go! [whispers] Go, go, go! [door creaks] [screen door squeaks] [squeaking continues] - [Marcus sighs] - [kids shouting] - I... [grunts] - Marcus! The hell are you doing here, man? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - You're sorry? - Yes. Yes. - You're sorry? I just wanted to apologize. - Apologize? - Yeah, yeah. Do you know what you did? No, I mean, I just, I'm sorry. Do you have any idea what you've done? Yes. I didn't... I didn't mean for all of it to happen. - Marcus, shut up. - I'm sorry. [sighs] Just get out of here, man. Okay. [scoffs] [siren wailing in distance] [sighs] [kids shouting] Shit. Hey, Marcus. Hey, get in the car. [soft music playing] I think you should see your mother. We'll have the apocalyptic Thanksgiving I always wanted. [emotional music playing] [panting] [door buzzes] [indistinct chatter] Who the hell is that? What do you want? I'm... I'm your son Marcus. Oh, my God. [gasps] Marcus? Yeah. Oh, honey. Mama, why did you put me in a group home? [sighs] I n... I... I really never meant to do that, Marcus. I never meant to do that. I... I... I love you, Mama. I love you too, sugar pie. Oh, I love you so much. Boy, look at you after all this time. Goddamn, I got me a big, fine, handsome son. Look at you, Marcus! Wow! Happy Thanksgiving, Mama. Oh, happy Thanksgiving, pumpkin. Did you bring me anything? Yeah, yeah, I got you... I got a... Look, I... It's an action figure from the 23rd episode of Apocalyptic Zombies, when they have to escape through the... Zombie what, Marcus? That's what you brought me? That's what you brought me, Marcus, huh? Marcus, you still retarded! Let me tell you something. You want to know why I couldn't take care of you, Marcus? Do you want to know why I put you in that home, Marcus? We could have been together. We could have made it, you know, we could have made it. But you, you used to kick, bite, and fight me all the time, - Marcus, all of the time. - I'm sorry. Do you remember the day at the car wash? When you hit me with that hose, Marcus. Do you remember that day at the car wash? [thumps fist] - Yes! - The cops took me to jail for dealing! They drove me to jail, Marcus, - 'cause of your dumb ass. - I'm sorry. Oh, baby we could have made it, though. I had the perfect thing. Used-up, old druggie and her retarded son seek redemption. Amen. Oh, yeah, that would have been the best hustle. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! [mocking] Look at you. What do you want? [guard] Time! Wait a minute. You know what? God didn't give me no star athlete - or no computer genius. - [sobs] He gave me a monster. You're a monster. - [guard] Look, I said time. - Wait a minute, wait a minute! - Stop!

Nicole said that somebody was moving out. - [Frank stammers] [stammers] Oh, wow. This place is more beautiful than the pictures. Doug! - Oh, you must be Frank. - Yes. - Nicole was wrong... - I'll take it. No, Nicole was wrong. There's no room available. Look, I'm sorry. Yeah, I didn't know that you wanted to stay here.
