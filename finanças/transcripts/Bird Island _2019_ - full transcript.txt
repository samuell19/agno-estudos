What's that smell? Shit. You'll get used to it. BIRD ISLAND We sit down when work's over or at break time. There's no sitting during working hours. OK. At the center, Paul bred rats and mice to feed to the birds of prey. Before retiring, he was responsible for training me. I'd never worked before and I was gradually learning how to conduct myself. I was willing enough, but my body was letting me down. I wasn't the only newcomer. Sandrine, who administered first aid to injured birds, was attending to an owl in a state of shock. Staring vacantly, the bird seemed to have forgotten its past life. Go ahead, I'll raise it slowly. He's scared. When that happens, put your hand in. It won't bite you. Take one of the two. - Hold onto it. - Yes. Should I take the other one? Take the one that comes towards you. You have to put it down quickly. Because when you pick up a rat... - Yes? - You get hold of its tail. And the tail is an extension of the spine. So the longer you hold it like that, - the more you pull on the spine. - The more it hurts? It doesn't really hurt, but it causes stress. You see. As it doesn't like what you're doing, it'll start spinning like a propeller to get away. Eventually it spins so much that the skin of the tail comes off. The rat gets away and you're left with the skin in your hands. So, this is a male. You can see clearly that... It's the space between the two orifices. With a male they're further apart and with a female they're closer together. And you check the sex of the mice to have a male and a female in each cage? We always put a male with three females. - Why three? - That's what we do. You can put one, two, three. But no more than that. That means there's always a litter coming along. With one female, you'd only get about one litter per month. That's not enough for us. So the more females, the more litters and the more productive it is. A long illness had left me isolated. The social services had decided a job at the center would reacquaint me with my peers. I was afraid I would be forgotten here, as Paul and Iwan had been, a long time ago, after they had lost their jobs. The most serious cases were treated in the care unit by Emilie, the vet. She radiated a calmness that caused the birds to stop struggling and temporarily put their trust in her. There are two solutions. The first is to set down the mouse, put the spoon on the nape of its neck and pull it across, breaking its neck. The second is to take a log or the edge of a piece of furniture and hit the mouse's neck against it, likewise breaking its neck. I was becoming aware of what lay ahead of me and I wondered whether I'd be able to do it. Paul seemed to me to be a man ordained. He'd accepted his role unquestioningly. Any qualms he had he kept to himself. The owl was coming round with difficulty. In this state, there was nothing else Emilie and Sandrine could do. Apart from care for it and wait for signs of improvement. I found the birds more intriguing by the day and wanted to penetrate beyond the surface of what I saw. Some of the birds had been there for so long that no one could remember exactly the reasons why. For others, it was time to go. Before she released them, Sandrine prepared them to return to the wild. Sandrine assessed how skillfully the birds caught their prey. Their performance had to be perfect, because to catch a mouse in the wild allowed for no clumsiness. - Paul? - Yes? Will you kill a small rat for me? Thanks. Emilie's voice always surprised me. Her appearances at the breeding house were fleeting but I reconciled myself to that. The wounds didn't bleed. This lulled me into thinking there was no emergency. Yet, Emilie was operating on an increasing number of birds. This constant flow of new patients was what alerted us. In the outside world, something was changing. With time, I grew to like the place where I'd been sent to convalesce. What had seemed a strange idea at first now seemed natural to me. I even felt confident enough to enter the owl's aviary. It had regained consciousness, but still wasn't able to hunt. No lesion was visible on the owl's body. But Emilie suspected it was blind in one eye. Paul's departure was approaching. Soon, I would have to assume my responsibilities. Sometimes, rats escaped from the breeding house. They dug galleries beneath the aviaries with their claws, or set about the wire grills directly with their teeth. That day, the rats had chosen as their victims the birds of the tunnel aviary. Having been indulgent with me so far, Paul now forced me to act. I had to put down poison at strategic points. Sandrine cataloged the dead birds. This task fell naturally to her as she alone knew every bird at the center. Those that had survived had been badly bitten by the rats. There was nothing more Emilie could do to save them. From time to time, I felt like crying. To resist the urge, all I had to do was close my eyes and listen to the sound of wings beating in the aviaries. Antonin? Emilie? Can I come in? Yes, come in. I'm observing the way the owl moves. It didn't eat the live mice last night. They usually detect their prey with their hearing, but having sight in only one eye seems to stop it catching them. It's going to be hard for it to return to the wild. I was treated for bone marrow aplasia with horse lymphocytes. But I still feel tired. Really? Its gray, brown and white feathers had a soft, dusty quality. I wanted to kiss it, but I was scared it would bite me. Some birds would come back to the center. They preferred security to the freedom of the wild. That one's funny. This is my favorite. She's on the sofa. Checking that her little world's still there. Can I have one? If you see one you like, yes, you can have it. I'll take this one. The one where she's standing. Great, I'm pleased for you to have it. I'm going to have a smoke. Are those the last planes? For me, yes. - For me, they're the last ones. - Yes. I meant of the day. Not of the day, no. Not for you, either, they won't be the last. Like me, you're going to be hearing them every day. - Will you do the cages that are left? - Yes. Then I hummed something made up, as if to say something other than goodbye to him. The birds weren't able to adapt to a world that was no longer made for them. Emilie had to address issues that had never arisen before. Her hands were venturing into the unknown. Now that Paul was leaving me, I felt close to him. I understood that to help the birds was comforting. No, don't put it there. You see, you have to put it here so that when people open the door they see the bunting. - It looks nicer, it's prettier. - Yes. But not too much, leave some... Like that. Then you tie it and you're done. Careful, move your feet. A bit tauter. The last thing to do was to test the fireworks for Paul's party. Jesus, that's nice! Very pretty! FAREWELL
