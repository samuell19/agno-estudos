Would you answer me if I asked a question, Jakob? What's going on with him lately? -Leave him alone. -Why? I just want my son to answer when I talk to him. Is that too much to ask? Am I some cruel dictator? No of course not. Then why isn't he talking to me? He is going through a difficult period. A difficult period? Well, I am too. -But do I take that out on him? -Stop it now. What does he take me for? Is that pure provocation? Or not? Am I just an old fool? -No. -Then why are you laughing? Sabine, say something to him. Remember to be back home on time, Jakob! Jakob! BAREFOOT TO THE NECK My parents are pretty normal. But why will I never understand them? I guess it has something to do with the past. In East Germany, there was the socialists... and there was a second major party, the FKK. CLOTHING PROHIBITED Dear friends, our property has been sold. Hey darling. Is everything okay? What will happen now with the sale? Your father will do what is best. This is our life. How will this affect us? This is going to be tough on Helmut. And to you? I don't want to interrupt. I just came to bring the sock collection. Thanks. Have you ever stopped to think that it would be an opportunity to move from here? There's such a big world out there. Maybe you forgot. Nobody forgot, Jakob. We are the oldest nudist colony in Germany. And we're proud of it. -We like it here. -Yeah... Can you really sell meat without wearing clothes? Oh, come on now, Jakob. -Is it the meat for the barbecue? -Yeah. You will come, right? -Funny. -Is it? It's a long-standing tradition. We don't embarrass anyone there. And I didn't mean to be funny. You like fairytales, Helmut. Those aren't stories, Jakob. Your father has been through it all. He's heard my story before, but it doesn't really get through to him. Exactly. -He must have something else on his mind. -Don't start again. Why does he have to be like that to me? Do you really think you're the only one who's had a rough time? Don't forget to come to the party. I would like you to show up. Okay? Helmut said you have to get naked or go home. Are you a cop or something? No, I'm your sister. And you always have to spoil everything. I'm not doing it. You should rebel too. Thanks. - Are you okay, Rosa? -Yeah. It's music time. Listen... Yes... Come on, dance! I don't understand why they sold the place. Why can't this place be owned by the people? People's property? That ceased to exist centuries ago. Today it's all about profit. The hunting ground alone is worth a fortune. Still a hunting ground... How low can you sink? Killing animals for fun? Do you know anything about the buyer? Will it be that bad? Even worse... Come on, tell us. His name is Lohe. Dieter Lohe. Doesn't sound bad. He comes from Munich and is about 40 years old. That's good, my age. Uwe, say something too. He is a Democrat, and Catholic. Practicing. And now comes the most important thing: he is an industrialist. A textile manufacturer. So he does cutting and sewing? So what? 1,730 acres. You won't find that anywhere else. I found it through the Land Management and Preservation auction. Yes... It's good land. And it's a bargain. Don't worry, it's not loaded. Sorry, Lara. I haven't hunted in so long. You haven't forgotten. It's like riding a bicycle. The opening of the new branch in Frankfurt is in 20 hours. Katherin, what color is that? Show me something new. And what is this? Stripes, stripes, stripes... Don't know how to create anything else? We'll see if it's worth what you get. I have adjusted your calendar so you don't forget the birthday tomorrow. Who's birthday? My daughter is turning 18. -And you'd forget that? -Yeah... It's necessary to set priorities, isn't it? You said it. We'll be back tomorrow night. Logical, of course... Give it to me here. Those are beautiful... It's also good... good, good... I have a flower arrangement ordered for your daughter. I said I would go there. Sure, sure. Good job. That's pretty light. This one is especially suitable for ladies. Lara, cancel my trip to Frankfurt. -What? We would... -Cancel. And, my daughter... will be happy. Happy birthday, Natalie! It's not that far. Get out everyone! Get out! Right now! Guys, that's just my dad. What are you doing? What if the neighbors see? Would they rape me if they did? You threatened my guests at gunpoint, Dieter. To you I am still "father", you hear? I thought they were burglars. It happens, sorry. Just throw another party. Have several, but no strippers. And I'll pay again. -What do you think? -I'm tired, I'm going to sleep. I just wanted to tell you... I bought it, that shotgun. Nice, isn't it? You'll never go to the hunting ground anyway. We are going together. There is a beautiful lake with a private beach. And then what? Are we going to build sandcastles? Like old times... It would be fun. Goodnight. I know our relationship isn't the best. I work a lot. But I promise I'll take a few weeks off. Too late, Dieter. I'm 18, I'm closing the door. You are not 18 yet. Now she's 18, yeah... Happy Birthday, Natalie... You have school. Helmut, what do you want? Is that what you want? Leather. I guess everyone should experience sexuality in their own way... Even if it is actually against nature. If you want to say something, just say it. You know there are people who can only reach orgasm... when their whole body is covered in latex... and they have to breathe through a straw. Those are teen movie costumes. They are normal costumes. What do you think about skin contact? That's real sex, isn't it? Don't you think that's normal? I want to take a shower, okay? Good Morning. You can bring a girl here. Here? Yeah. Good Morning! Steiner, good to see you. I'm not sure, but isn't that your mother? How are you? Are you going to spend the entire vacation not talking to me? This isn't a vacation, we're pretending it is. You'll spend a few days with me, and then you'll have your own apartment. Complete with everything you need. Honey, that's a great gift. We're a good team. At least we were in the past. These will be unforgettable days. I promise you. It must be here. Where is everyone? There's no one. Maybe they don't show up until midnight. Maybe they're in Bavaria or Baden-Wurttemberg. There's no work here... Hey, there's someone. I will ask him. Stop him. Are you crazy? Hello... Are you okay? What was it? Did you get hurt? Are you injured? He swallowed his tongue. We are looking for a hotel. He didn't hear... Em... I will show you... Your father? My rich old lover. We are traveling together. But instead of going to Rio or the Cote d'Azur... we thought, why not stay among the rabbits? Rabbits... Original, isn't it? Thank you, German unification. What kind of hotel is this? A communal bathroom in the hallway... Are there no other accommodations? I'm sorry. Please, for you. Thanks. -What now? -I'll find something. Isn't there a sports club around here, in the wild? Maybe there's a campsite, then we can spend the night there. On a campsite? You would like to spend the night in the great outdoors? Is there something wrong with that? You don't look like the type. You seem pretty conservative. Boring... you mean. Only my standards are conservative. And that's good. I love sports. Super cool. You don't understand. -All the territory is mine. -What? Are you the new owner? I haven't introduced myself yet. Lohe. Dieter Lohe. She is my daughter. Okay. Yes, you take this street. Then turn right to the end and turn left... -Then keep straight. -Thank you. What do you think? Shall we eat something first? Whatever... "Whatever". What is it, Jakob? Don't you have to go to school? -The new owner has arrived. -Here? Yes, and he thinks this is an ordinary campsite. Seriously? -With clothes? -Yeah. Man... It is so hot. The new owner is here. -What? -Yeah... Mr. Lohe doesn't know we're nudists. Didn't you tell him? What's he like? He's quite conservative. But we are nudists. And we will continue to be. Right, he can't do anything. I wish it were that simple, Conny. The question really is: "New owner... can you cancel our lease?" -Yeah. -Is that right? What can I say... The guy can kick us out. Don't stay in here like this. He will soon be here with his daughter. If he sees you like this, this place is finished. -What do you suggest, Jakob? -Sorry, I meant well. Thank you for the warning, Jakob. But we need constructive ideas. Socke, discuss something about the philosophy of nudism. Uwe, you talk to him about the finances. Then he will see that we always pay the fees on time. Sabine, pour the coffee. This creates a relaxed atmosphere. Good. Any other ideas? There's nobody here. Wait a moment... -You answer. -But I'm not decent. Jakob, that's not funny. Then do something yourself. Let's hide. He'll think we're normal. Do you like what he thinks is normal? Sorry, he works in the textile industry. This has nothing to do with it. I don't think that's so bad. It's a very good idea. How so? What do you mean? Jakob is right. He will never accept our way of life. -Pardon? -We've already lost the Baltic Sea. There are almost no more FKK reserves left. We'll hide until Mr. Lohe goes away. Well, here I am again. Do you like outdoor sports? Haha. "Jakob's Sports Club". This way. Can you please get out of the car? Nice view, isn't it? This is the club house. Hello. Helmut, that's called underwear. So what? Are my balls hanging out? -Who is he? -Shut up, okay? How is the sports club doing? -The what? -The sports club. We are not a sports club. But we'd like to create one, it's true. How so? Because we are free-thinking libertarians, therefore... As my husband says, we have always been libertarians. And it was always difficult to fit in with those outside. I understand. My husband was a blacksmith at the metal foundry nearby. We used to come here on vacation. But when Helmut lost his job... we came to live here because we couldn't survive on my salesperson's income. Here you can always enjoy the fresh air, right? -Enviable. -Yeah. Yes it's true. Well then... Nice to have met you. -Do you have to go already? -Excuse me? I would like to go to my room. Yes, they want to spend the night here. Didn't I tell you? With us here? I don't usually do that. But since I'm the owner, I thought... Or is that a problem? Great, then I can go hunting from here. And I have something nice in store for you. Who will show us the way? Uh... No, I think it's better this way. Better? Are you crazy? We'll regret this. No, Helmut, wait a minute. If they go to a hotel... How long will it take for them to discover who we really are? -Exactly. -"Exactly"... You're joking. This is a bunker, not a holiday home. Come on. It's a vacation cabin. Cool, huh? We'll sleep here tonight anyway. And tomorrow we'll go hunting together. That's gonna be so cool. What a pleasant surprise. I'm going for a walk. Mmm, thank you. At the dance, none of the boys wanted to dance with me. I think I'm ugly. Nonsense. Not at all. Then what's wrong with me? I don't know, Rosie. Maybe they have to get to know you before seeing your bare breasts. -What's wrong with my breasts? -Nothing. Your breasts are fine. Natalie is pretty, isn't she? Are you afraid to tell me you like her? Hey Rosa. Your brother made us just like him. Instead of sending them away, we all have to wear clothes. Unbelievable. Look, this hurts. There's a splinter in my hand... You smell nice. You know, you work way too much. Other girls your age go to the disco... go party with their friends... -Should I speak to Helmut? -No, that's not necessary. If you have any problems, if there is anything wrong... you know you can always come to me, right? By the way, I will be the DJ again at the next party. Are you coming? Nice. Damn, I thought I brought my swimming trunks. I'll go to the store. I'm sure I'll find something. I'll be back. Helmut, what are you doing? Put on some pants before Dieter and Natalie walk by. They're on vacation, they must still be sleeping. Hi Dieter. One... Two... Mr. Lohe is coming. Come on, hide. -Hello. -Hello. What can I do for you? I'm looking for a swimsuit. A swimsuit? We're sold out, unfortunately. Jump in the water naked, no one will notice here... Funny. -Or swim in your underwear. -No... Red suits you well. Thanks. What is it actually? You... well... -Good morning, Socke. -Good Morning. -Helmut... -Hello. Sit down. Want a cup of coffee? Another coffee. What's that doing there? I bought it from your wife. She said it is an egg cozy. I didn't realize you had trouble here with cold eggs. Do you make those yourself? Those are from me. Pure organic cotton. Helmut, can I have a word with you? In a moment. I want to talk to Mr. Lohe first. Do you like it? Are you saying "you" already? I am Dieter. This is my first vacation in 10 years. -Unbelievable, isn't it? -Yeah... You have a nice shirt. I bought a similar one at a fair in Leipzig. It said: "We are one people." But I'm not good with dialects. This is our club shirt. -Nice. -Do you want one. I can get you one. -No, that's not necessary. -But still... I have enough. What's that on your back? "FKK"? Yes... Dieter, I was meaning to say... What does that stand for? Hadn't you noticed? FKK... But it says "nudist" on it. What does that mean? In Portuguese it means "Free Golf Club", Dieter. You should rename your club. That could cause confusion. What do you think of nudism? Repulsive. What did you want to talk to me about? It's not that important. Thanks. -Do you also want a dress? -No. Think of Italy. I feel like shit. Look at me. I look like a trained monkey. - You look good. - Not at all. And you... Look at yourself. Sabine, we need to face this differently. Excuse me... There's still something there. -Hi, I'm Karl. -Hello. You have to fully stretch. Is this good? Yes, that's good. Hey, Karl... Natalie, how are you? -I'm all right. -What are you doing? Teaching her how to fly? What do you think? You fooled me! Damn! -I'm coming after you. -Hey, Karl... I like her, you know? Yes, me too. Cool girl. Thank you, friend. You're out of luck. Asshole. What do you think of Conny? Conny? Yes, he looks at me like that and... Sorry, I can't talk right now. Do you really want to come with me to the dance tonight? Okay, it was just a joke. Will you stay in your room while I get dressed, Dieter? Do you always worry about your privacy? And call me "father". I'm ready. -Drinks! -Thank you, Jakob. Hello Jakob. Thanks for the invitation. -Will you grant me the first dance? -No. You might like to dance with me. Sorry, but my daughter and I want some time together. -I do not want it. -Anyway. Our son is really in love. Yeah, but that's why we have to play dress up? Forget about that for now. Our son is a real orator. I can't believe you haven't said anything about my dress, Helmut. I like it, but I'd be happier if I could take it off. Yes, this is a great song! For the real lady killers! Who wants a sausage? I'll get some drinks. -Hey... -Hi... -Your father won't leave you alone for a single minute, will he? - He's acting overprotective. I still have 72 hours to build a father-daughter relationship. -How so? What happens then? - Then I'm leaving. And then he'll never see me again. What about your mother? -Is she dead? - Excuse me? Is that rum and Coke? -Would you like one? -Thanks. Let's get out of here. Sorry. Lohe is a good dancer, isn't he? Lohe? A good dancer? Not at all. He's ridiculous. How many hours do I have to dance with Dieter... so you can have a chance with his daughter? How nice of you. Should I continue? I'll go back right now. You're drunk... and having fun? Yes I am. It happens so rarely that I hardly know what it's like anymore. Did she run off? She left with Karl. He's so good looking, my God! Thank you, now I feel much better. Sorry, sorry... There is no better guy in the world than you. Give her a little more time to see your qualities. Why don't you talk to me anymore? We used to talk about everything. We even talked about the girls. Well... I have so many questions in my head... I can try to answer some. There is an important one: "When will this end?" You already told me about the birds and the bees. And how beautiful it is that you and dad love each other so much. Yes it is... You even walk around naked. Sometimes I don't even know where to look. Sorry, Sabine, but that's where it belongs. A child does not care. I'm sorry about that, Jakob. When you say it like that, it sounds so absurd. But we meant well. We just wanted to move freely, and at least feel free. Don't worry, I'm not preaching. I leave that to your father. Helmut is the bravest man I know. I wish you knew him like I used to. How annoying... I cannot tolerate this. Damn clothes. I'm checking to see if the coast is clear. I always have to go on business trips abroad... After this vacation, I'm going to New Zealand. New Zealand? So it's not just Europe? Okay, coast is clear. Good Morning. Wake up! It's a beautiful day. Wake up. Good Morning. Good Morning. What's going on here? What are you doing? - Water gymnastics. -Come on... Come... -Dieter, have a seat, do you want coffee? -No thank you. There must be a misunderstanding. My friend said that he was alone and wanted to warm up. Naked. He was standing there stark naked! I saw it myself. He stood there and also made obscene movements! Did he not? Don't make such a fuss about it, Dieter. Please. Don't call me "Dieter"! I am your father! Can you for once at least be less arrogant... and speak normally to me, please. I insist that there be consequences. Otherwise, you must leave here. Come on! -I think they should go. -No. You have to explain to him, say something. This is absurd. With clothes hanging! What should I do? Kneel before him and beg? Perhaps Jakob has another brilliant idea? They can leave. He says this because of Natalie and Karl. -Fuck them, I don't care. -Jakob! I don't know... Can you temporarily ban Uwe? Yes, that's a good idea. Thank you. Just to satisfy the formalities. How can you ask that? No, no. No way. Helmut... It's alright. We no longer live in the Middle Ages. He doesn't own us. Come on, Helmut, I know that too. It was a club violation. Every sports federation has its own committee. But we are not a club. We are free thinkers, damn it. And we still have to go through with this circus. Hello everyone. Stand up. Dear friends... We are gathered today... to vote on Uwe Hofer's suspension. Until later... For freedom. Come on, Helmut. It ended all right. Yeah, but I feel like a traitor. -And I hate that. -I didn't force you to do anything, okay? Don't start again. -Hey guys. -Hey. -I thought we were going to eat something. -In a moment. I wanted to congratulate you, Helmut. For what? What's the reason? For the determination with which you led the meeting. I don't want to offend anyone, but... you're not exactly popular for your initiative. In most organizations in the west we follow one of the biblical principles: "Nothing seen, nothing heard, but... Our Heavenly Father listens anyway." Well... I suppose the east also has its advantages. Like what? Less traffic? Sex... in the east they have sex more than we do. -Are you trying to embarrass me? -That's not a problem, is it? Here in the east, sexuality is not taboo. Here we don't have that double standard... like sneaky posters with nudity. No, we don't have that prudishness. Helmut... Tell me, why don't you call him "father"? Free Market Economy ... How can the body be a commodity? -Could you explain that? -Helmut, please... You are absolutely right. -Pardon? - You are absolutely right. Will you eat with us? Rosie, set the table for two more, please. I mean, sex is present everywhere these days. I wonder what that does to our youth. With us it's much better. Isn't that true, Sabine? For us, sexuality is something completely natural. We've done it more than twice, put it that way. Isn't that cliche? No, we love it in the east. What is more beautiful than birding? Can't you keep these comments to yourself? Sorry, but a healthy sex life is fundamental. Isn't that right? Dieter can't talk about that. What do you mean? And call me dad, okay? Can we have a normal conversation now? This is a normal conversation, Jakob. -Do you have to argue again? -No. Well, who wants the last sausage? The last sausage... I thought the west had no sense of humor. Hey. Hello. Can you give me a hand? Here. Thanks. Does Dieter know about this place? -I don't think so. -Great. This will be the longest 72 hours of my life. What is that? That's The Hulk. My mother is not dead. She is divorced. Aren't they both? Vera is divorced... from her second husband. Dieter and Vera were never married. Why did you stay with your father? That is unusual. Being a mother is not for Vera, she is very chaotic. -She even forgets my birthday. -Seriously? But my friends don't see their mothers that often either. And when they see them, they fight. I'm actually glad she's gone for good. Your father is normal at least. You think so? What's wrong with your father? Well, he interferes with everything. He worries, so to speak. And you think that's a bad thing? Natalie... Natalie! Natalie, I've been looking everywhere for you. I spoke to the guys at the bar. They're keeping it open longer. Will you come? -Yeah. -Good. Jakob, you have to get up early tomorrow, right? So, Dieter, tell us... Why don't you have sex? -How do you know that? -Isn't that what Natalie just said? You shouldn't listen to Natalie. I don't tell her everything. She immediately concluded that I don't have sex. -So then, do you have sex? -Helmut, leave him alone. I'm not used to this kind of conversation at the table... I haven't been in a steady relationship for a long time. That is a fact. Why? Can't you find a wife? Yeah, but because of all the stress with Natalie... women walk away. They run away. And now I've given up on having a new family. And now your daughter throws herself at boyfriends. And you are left alone. Poor soul. Poor I am not, Helmut. - Slow down, please... - What is this? -Take it easy. -Okay. I have a condom with me. What are you saying? I want to sleep with you... What do you think? You only want one thing, don't you? You didn't think to ask if I actually want to? -Leave her alone, Karl. -Stay out of this, Jakob. Leave her alone. Get out of here! Go to bed. -Did you hear that? -Yeah. Shit. Helmut, can you at least not throw me out on the street? What can I do? Dieter left me with no choice. For freedom. Well, shall we go hunting? Then we can discuss our rental agreement. You know, I get upset with myself. I always fall for the same type of guys. All they want is to have me as a trophy on the wall. You're so damn beautiful too. Nobody sees that. Nonsense. You didn't look at me the other day when I undressed. Did I not look? -Sorry. -For what? Because you are different from the others. I like that. -Yes, we did. -Really? I don't know. Actually, she was my best friend here... but suddenly she didn't want to know me anymore. What can I say? We had sex and then it was over. But was it nice? Well? It was okay... What did you want to hear then? It was nice, it was very good. Well... Have you had sex often... after the first time? No... I really have to feel something for a girl before I sleep with her. Sweet. You are such a romantic. Unbelievable. Have you ever served in the military? I was in a construction battalion. -A pioneer? -No, I was against that. I didn't fire a gun. You don't know how lucky you are. This is a great hunting ground... for so little money. This is only possible in the east. Maybe I should congratulate you. Not so loud. What... My property or public property, who cares? I mean, you have customary law here. Look... Is it a deer? -No. -I got her... Heavens...No! What are you doing? Are you crazy? What? My God... You are awesome. "I don't shoot. I'm a pacifist." I don't believe a word of it. From that distance, and freehand! That's class. Are you sure you weren't a sniper? Very funny. Well, I give you credit, my friend. An old custom, you must cut out the heart of the first shot game. Are you crazy? What do you take me for? It's bad enough we killed this animal. And now I have to cut it open! No! -Helmut... -No, I'm serious. My foot... -Pardon? -Pull it out, will you? You're kidding me. - Dieter, I'm going to throw up. -Remove it first. Hey Rosa... Aren't you late for school? Where is your brother? -You want me to take you there? -I'm fine. Have fun. Doing my military service under the arms of this fucking country... that was just impossible for me. Okay. But you know what the worst part is? People forget how it was before. My own son doesn't care. He doesn't care. I've told my daughter what I went through... that I raised her alone, since she was a baby... and the company I inherited from my father, but she won't even listen. It all makes me so exhausted. When the east and west separated, it all went wrong. I couldn't find work anywhere. Yes, I'm glad the wall is gone. Yes, now we can work again. But my profession no longer exists. Isn't it ironic? Poor soul... Have another drink. Dieter, to your health. We're not really going to eat that? Are we? -Absolutely. -Of course. Sabine, this is especially for you. Thank you very much. Thanks to Dieter, I became a man today. Not that that means much. You like staying with us, don't you? Certainly. I love families. Despite the eternal bickering? That is completely normal, isn't it? Try to convince Jakob of that. He always acts like we are his bad karma... that he has to face in his life. Would you like to go to the lake? Is that good? Good... Ah, thank you. Tell me, Helmut... Your children and you... you can get along very well together. We also have our problems. How so? Just like that... How much time do you spend with Natalie? Everything okay? Absolutely. When I was born, my mother was as old as I am now. 18 years old? She left me when I was a baby. And then I didn't hear from her until a few years ago. Really? I never understood why she didn't want me... I never even wanted to ask. I convinced Vera not to terminate the pregnancy. I loved her so much. But I also wanted to be a father. You did your best. No... Well, maybe... A little. But after Vera left... the feeling disappeared too. But despite everything, I still believe... that Natalie and I were very happy at the time. Just us two. It was the two of us against the world. We had fun and laughed a lot. I don't know what happened. Work. The success. I wish I had gotten my red card sooner. Sometimes I would like to go back a little in time, you know? Take off your clothes. -What? -I know it would do you good. No, it's not what you're thinking. You are rigid. No I'm not. Your muscles are totally tight. So, what shall it be? Ayurveda, Shiatsu, Yumi Yumi? Like this... - Dude, your hands are ice cold. -You're all cramped. Hey, Steiner... When can I come to your house? I want to see your mother. Does she have a really tight ass? Tell me, Helmut. One thing I don't understand... What do you actually live on? What do you mean, Dieter? -What do you mean? -How do you make money? With membership fees, of course. -And how do you get new memberships? -What does it matter? Do we have to do market research now? You think you know everything, but... I just want to say that you don't even have a proper sign. How do people know you're here? Or is there not enough money for it? I can finance you. A new road sign can attract new people. -Dieter... -Relax. I mean, what are we now? Business partners... Friends... Or not? I'll see you at dinner. I'll bring the beer. Excellent. Thanks. Don't forget we have to discuss the lease later. Sure. I have to tell him. Shit. Shit. Can you take me to school? I have a flat tire. -Problems? -No, no problem. Rosie, get in. I'll quickly put on something else. I'll drive her. I have to go into town anyway. -I'll take Rosa. -No, thank you. Okay, that's practical. Daddy, I... -Bye, Rosie. -See you later. Daddy? -Alright, Rosie... -Don't call me Rosie. Only my family calls me that. Sorry, I thought you might like to hear that. What should we do? Shall we go shopping? I'll buy you a new dress. A sexy lipstick... Or a bikini... No, thank you. Skip school, I won't say anything. Why are you so angry with me? I just want to make my sweetheart happy. I'm not your sweetheart. Anyway... Rosa, come back here, now. Don't be ridiculous. Or shall I tell your father you prefer to walk? No problem. What if I go to Dieter Lohe and tell him the whole truth? Is that just my problem? Rosa, listen to me. You'll be nice to me if you don't want to get your family in serious trouble. My God, how complicated everything is. Helmut, pull yourself together. I have to tell him, but I don't know how. Hey, Rosie... Here I am. What about Conny? I ran away from him... He'll tell Dieter everything. No... I would like to say that this contract is merely a formality. Fine. Dieter, before we begin, I need to... Thank you very much. Dieter. Don't say anything, you bastard! You motherfucker, motherfucker... Jakob, Jakob... If you think you can blackmail us, you're wrong! -And keep your hands off my sister! -What happened to Rosie? -He was going to rape her. -What nonsense is this? All nonsense. You lie to everyone! And you don't even realize it! -Me? -Yeah. -What am I missing? -Our freedom is the "FKK". -Yeah, so? -Jakob... -We're nudists. -Yeah. Yes, I'm a nudist. I admit it. Do you get it now? Get out. I don't ever want to see you here again. So you've been deceiving us from the start... Am I mistaken? Was it all theater? Yeah... I mean, no. Sorry, Dieter. What should I do now? Should I go to jail? Come on... Natalie... Do you find this funny? I don't find it funny. I thought we were friends. Hey Steiner, how are the naked ones? He won't talk to us. We're not good enough. Hey man, take off your clothes! CLOTHING PROHIBITED Do you know what I ask myself? If we had told him right away... perhaps he would have accepted it after all? Sorry, I just wanted to help. Did you? What's upsetting you? Hey. You have always been ashamed of us, Jakob. Do you think I meant you harm or something? "Just look at all those people who wear clothes." "I guess you don't want to be like them, do you?" That's not the point. You want me to be like you, but... I'm not like that. Is it really that bad here? Jakob, have I ever scared you or abused you? Am I a fool? You really don't understand what it's about, do you? You forgot how to listen to us. Alright. Sit down, let's talk. You don't know what it does to me. You make me look ridiculous. In everything it was like that. Nudity is the most natural thing in the world, Jakob. That's easy for you to say. You leave here once a month for purchases. I have to go outside the community everyday. I go to school all week, and I have to take shit from people. I'm sick of it. Idealists always appear abnormal. Me and your mother will never bow down. We do not have this belief just by chance. We live in a community here of dissident people. Do you understand that? And if I don't think the same, do I not belong here? Of course you do. For Heaven's sake... Jakob... Jakob. Friend Muller's proposal is approved by eleven votes to three. Coffee will be served in the afternoon with a vegetarian dish. Anything else on the agenda? Yes, the showers need to be renovated. I think that's something for the next meeting. -What's wrong? -Tuscany, 19 years ago. -Yeah, so? -This dress. I bought it in Siena on our vacation in Tuscany. You told me we would do that every year, Helmut. But you didn't say you planned to come here every year. Not so loud, Sabine. What is it? Jakob is gone. He ran away. Helmut, Helmut... This cannot go on. Your intolerance has become unbearable. What? I'm intolerant? Yes, you are very intolerant. Helmut, I know we had it bad, and that's why we left. And yes, luckily, we found this community. But that was a long time ago. Why are you still retreating? Come out of your shell. Otherwise, you will lose your children, Helmut. And me too. Chief... What is this supposed to be, a school trip? -Socke, this is between me and my son. -Jakob is also one of us. To the west. Everything good? Now go to your guests. I especially invited them... to make up for your birthday. I'm looking for an apartment tomorrow. What's the rush? I thought we had a deal. We would spend the holidays and I would get the apartment. You call that a vacation? Poor dieter. Did you make a bad deal? You won't even notice I'm gone. Helmut, come what may, we are nudists. And we always will be! Everything has its time Collecting stones creates dispersion. Planting trees and gathering wood Live, die and fight And in the end they had deceived us all along. -Seriously? -Yeah. They are nudists. -No... -Yes. Natalie. What are you doing here? Shit, the police. What are you doing? We are nudists and always will be. Right now? Documents, please. You have exceeded the speed limit. This is an official report. Don't worry, we're in this together. Get out. Everyone please. Please, I can explain. Your lies have pushed me away. Would I come here if I didn't care? You weren't invited, okay? I didn't invite you either. Will you please leave? -I need to talk to you, Natalie. - I don't need to talk to you. Is that clear enough? Go now. Come on, get out quickly. We will continue on foot. Helmut, we just drove too fast! Plus violation of public morals. Run! -And the driver is gone. -Run after him. Be careful. Five middle-aged naked men are on the run from the police... -Jakob, please... -Listen, Dieter. You want to distract me. Come on... What? They left the car... on the side of the road and fled. On foot, barefoot up to the neck. For the sake of our underage viewers, we will not zoom in. The men are still on the run. That is Helmut. What he is doing there? Is your campground not big enough anymore? I feel sorry for you, having a father like that. Nudists... you see what comes of it. Natalie... Please don't. Perhaps you are right. Nudism is bullshit. But I was raised that way. They are my family. And your family supports you no matter what. Am I right, Dieter? Natalie... Thank you for what you've given me, it was very special. Because of you, I finally know where I belong. You are the prettiest girl I've ever known. I love you. Sabine, Helmut is on TV. We were the first FKK colony in Germany. We survived Communism. And now they want to shut us down.. We only care about freedom. We are people of different social classes. But with us it doesn't matter if someone comes with an expensive car or by bus. Naked, all men are equal. Thank you. Sorry, can I say something else? Yes. While trying to save our campsite... I lied to someone, a friend. He is very conservative, yet he is a true friend. Dieter, if you can hear this, I want to say I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. -It's me. -Where are you? In jail. But I'm innocent... You don't think Dieter will close the campsite, now that the whole country is watching? You did your best. You made a bold speech on TV. How are you? I thought I would never go back to jail. What? Have you been in jail before? You still don't know all my stories. -Do you want to hear them? -Yes. When I tried to flee the military, I was arrested, and interrogated for hours. But first I had to undress, completely naked. They did this to humiliate the prisoners. Isn't that crazy? But that wasn't so bad, Jakob. Now I've become a lot more boring, haven't I? I'm proud of you, dad. Are you coming back home? Sure. Sorry I... Did you hear? What? Didn't you hear anything? Poor Jakob. What are you talking about? The ringing of the bells. I heard them loud and clear. Again? Okay. -Come on. -I said I... I'm coming after you later. You leave first, otherwise it will cause trouble. Come with me please. I can't do that. I was hoping you'd say goodbye before you left. Or did you just decide to leave? Go now. Good morning, Dieter. Bye. Four months... That's how old you were when you first slept through the night. That was good. That was very nice of you. At six months old, you ate your first leek... You didn't like carrots, but you ate apples and bananas. And at nine months, your first tooth came. That was a little late, but it wasn't too bad... At two and a half, you stopped wetting the bed. At the age of three, you went to kindergarten. Shall I continue? I know it's all my fault. Despite everything... I didn't want anything else in the whole world than having my daughter back. Well, think how good it is.. -I'm sorry, daddy. -That's alright... Relax... What you... -What are you doing here? -Dear friends... Welcome with me our new friend, Dieter Lohe. - He has something important to say. -And now... And now here's Dieter. I am pleased to announce... that our contract has been extended for 20 years. Congratulations, the contract has been renewed. Or do you think this is not good? Of course I think it's good... CLOTHING ALLOWED Hi Dieter. Everyone will stare at you if you keep your clothes on. - Are you coming in? - You can keep your shorts on. We don't want to force anyone out of their clothes, do we, Sabine? But, Dieter, think about it... If God didn't want us to be naked... We wouldn't have entered the world naked, I know.
