Hello again and welcome back to 'English today'. This is DVD seventeen and the fifth DVD of your upper intermediate level. And in this DVD we'll begin with another two episodes of our story 'That's life!', followed by our special TV programmes where our culinary expert will be talking about how to set the table. This will be followed by a discussion about e-commerce and about doing business on the internet. Then in the grammar section we'll study how to position adjectives in the English sentence and also look at some of the main differences between American and British English, alright? So, enjoy yourselves and enjoy your viewing. l knew it! lt couldn't have been different... Watch out! Did you hurt yourself? You should watch where you're going. Oh no! l'm used to walking into things. You know l'm a bit absent minded. When l was a kid l was always falling over. l was always covered in bruises. Excuse me now... The first full moon of the summer! Just wonderful! What's the full moon got to do with anything? Come on, please, tell me what you're reading... lt's just a beautiful love story full of passion. lt's a love story between a young lady of the nobility and a farmer. The girl's father wants her to marry a lord and is against the relationship. So he arranges to have the young farmer kidnapped and locked away in a secret room to die of hunger and thirst. What a sad story. . . lsn't it rather depressing? Well, wait a minute, l haven't finished. The kidnapping happened on the first full moon of the summer, just a moment before the two lovers had arranged to meet. Legend says that every year on that night the young girl returns to look for her lover! Do you see?! What should l see? lt's a legend! Don't tell me l should believe in such a stupid thing! Well, on the contrary, l think you should! This is the interesting part! This love story took place here, in this house! And tonight there's the first full moon of the summer! This is so exciting! l know this holiday would bring some pleasant surprises! You must be mad! By the way, where on earth did you find that book? Up in the attic! lt must have been written by one of Paolo's ancestors! lf l'd known that room contained some treasures like this book, l've locked myself in there for the whole holiday! You shouldn't go noseying around everywhere, Michelle! And you should leave me alone then, l'm going to get the others together now. We'll devise a plan for tonight, so we can look for the young girl's ghost. Hey Sarah! Look a flip! Hello!? Hello! l'm glad you're here. We've been here since noon. l've made an incredible discovery! What's this about? Well. . . According to Michelle this house is home to the spirit of a young girl. And this young girl is going to appear to us tonight as a ghost... Don't make fun! lt's true, l red it in the book l found at home. And, l can feel it too, there's a strange atmosphere, almost surreal! l think the only strange thing here is you! That's exactly what l said! Enough of that! Listen to me! This is the plan for tonight: when the moon's high in the sky we'll get some candles and go and look for the ghost. Paolo, didn't you know anything about this story? Well, my grandfather did tell me something about it. When l was a boy l used to go looking for spirits with my cousins. Didn't you feel frightened? No, it was a great fun! Sure. . . Everyone knows ghosts don't exist. You're wrong there! One night we heard some strange noises... Someone was shouting! We were so scared! We ran to our rooms, my youngest cousin cried for two days; he was so terrified. What rubbish! l think you've just invented the whole story! Stop arguing! Paolo and l are going to look for the ghost tonight. Sandra, are you coming with us? l don't really believe in these things but if you're both going. . . Well. . . Why not? lt'll be a bit of change from the other evenings. And, by the way, l'm quite curious to find out whether this ghost really exists or not. Sarah, are you coming with us? Oh no! l don't believe in spirits and l don't do such stupid things. l'll just stay in my room and read. Come on Sarah, don't be the usual spoilsport! Come with us! You'll see, it'll be fun! Don't insist! l said no! That damn pub! She wouldn't be like this if it hadn't burned down! l know, you're right! Let's try not to let her problems get us down! Sandra, can you call Mike and Anne and we'll tell them what's the plan for tonight! 'Ghost hunting under a full moon'. Hi everyone and welcome back for another lesson. Now, as you've been watching our story 'That's life!', you've probably noticed that there are different 'Englishes', different accents like British English, American English, Australian English? Now you can often notice that from the accent, but we don't only notice the difference from the accent, there are also differences in vocabulary, and this is something that l want to look at with you now, especially between British English and American English. So we'll look at the screen and you can see the words written, because British English and American English, when l meet, for example, an American person l usually don't have any problems understanding but occasionally. . . Let me tell you this story: an American said to me once, he said 'Do you have a mousse?'. And l didn't know what to answer, he said 'Do you have a mousse?'. Now in the English language 'a mousse' is either the dessert that you eat at the end of a meal, like chocolate mousse, or it's the animal (moose) with antlers that you see in Canada, so, none of those things were appropriate for the situation that we were in. So l had to say 'Sorry what do you mean by mousse?', and for him the mousse was a mattress, you know, part of the bed where you sleep on, a mousse was a mattress. l was just flabbergasted, l could never have guessed that a mousse was a mattress. So let me show you or introduce you, maybe you know some of these already, especially if you watch the cinema a lot, some of the difference in terminologies and vocabulary between American and English, alright? Now, look at the screen. ln British English we talk about living in a 'flat' which is a small house, in the condominium, so that's a 'flat' but the Americans tend to call that an 'apartment', alright? Then we in England have 'gardens' which are often attached to our houses, or our flats, but in America they call that a 'yard' alright? A 'yard' so 'in my backyard' you often hear. Then when you have rubbish in England we put the rubbish in a 'rubbish bin' but in American, in America rubbish is garbage so they put their rubbish in a 'garbage can', so 'rubbish bin', 'garbage can'. lf l say in British English 'l'm going to town' the Americans will say 'l'm going downtown', 'l'm going downtown'. ln England walking along the streets, the part beside the street itself, beside the road, is called a 'pavement' but in America that is called a 'sidewalk'. 'Pavement', 'sidewalk'. We put our cars in the 'car park' but in America they call a 'car park' a 'parking lot' ok? 'Parking lot'. We, in Britain, we drive on 'motorways' whereas in America you will hear the word 'freeway' or 'highway' or even 'superhighway', alright? So 'motorway' in Britain, 'freeway', 'highway' in America. Then when all the roads come together, we call that in English a 'junction' but the Americans call it an 'intersection', 'junction', 'intersection'. When we are travelling in our cars we go and we buy 'petrol', the Americans buy 'gas' or 'gasoline'. For us 'gas' is a liquid air, so 'gas', 'gasoline' in British English is 'petrol', ok? Then in England we go to the 'cinema' in America they prefer often to use 'movies', go to the movies. Then for example if you go to a theatre and you want to go to the 'wardrobe', for example, and leave your coats etcetera, very often in America that is called the 'closet', so 'wardrobe', 'closet'. Then if you're in a restaurant, to begin with, we in England have a 'starter' the Americans have an 'appetizer'. And, this is very interesting, we... When you take potatoes and you fry them, and for example, you have it with steak, in English those are called 'chips', the Americans use 'french fries'. Now, in English, when you have a bag, for example at a party if you're having an aperitif, we often have nuts, and what we call 'crisps', now 'crisps' are very thin pieces of potato, chopped up very finely and then cooked usually in hot oil and put in plastic bags. Now we call those 'crisps' but the Americans call them 'potato chips' so it's very confusing, for us 'chips' is what you have with steak, and the 'crisps' are the things that you have in a bag, alright? And one more thing, in Britain we talk about summer, winter, spring, and autumn, but often in American English you will hear 'autumn' referred to as 'fall'. So those are just a few examples of the difference between British English and American English, but keep noticing the differences when you're, especially, when you're watching films because it really is very interesting, and it will help you in preparation for when you go to both countries, alright? So, good to see you again and l look forward to seeing you again in the next lesson, bye! So, this is the abbandoned wing. . . Yes. . . l should never got involved in this charade! l still can't believe you persuaded me to come along. Come on, Anne, you'll have fun! You won't regret. Can anyone tell me exactly what it is we're looking for? Mike! Do you ever listen when people talk to you? We're looking for the ghost of a young girl. Legend says that when the full moon's high in the sky she returns here to look for her young lover. She walks up and down the secret spot where she used to meet him. And where is this secret spot?? Well, we don't know, but Paolo told me that last year he'd heard strange sounds coming from this house. We can start from here. Where 'here'? How can we possibly if we can't see anything in the dark?! Don't worry! l know this place very well! Ok silence! Otherwise we are not going to hear anything! Did anyone ask Sarah if she wanted to come along with us? Of course we did. She isn't interested. . . She doesn't believe in ghosts. You still should have insisted. lt's not nice to leave her by herself at night... Can we please start searching again? Ahh! Help, there's somebody here! l don't see anything! Are you sure? Someone touched me on my shoulder! Yes l'm sure! They squeezed my shoulder. lt's me! What an idiot! Paolo! Ok! Now that we've solved that mystery, silence everyone and let's continue! To be honest, this place is kind of. . . Creepy? Creepy, yes! Guys, guys wait for us! Please! Who's come to disturb my eternal sleep?? Oh crikey!! l'm not feeling very well! l think l'm going to faint! Shut up! Now... We... we read about you. And we... we want to get to know you! l don't like intruders! Do you know what happens to the people who cross my path? What... what happens? A horrible death! You must choose between being burnt alive or being eaten by wolves. Oh, my God! Listen Miss Lady ghost, l think there must be some misunderstanding here. We're all going to leave now, and let you look for your lover in peace and quiet. Right everyone? Don't move an inch! lt's too late. Your fate has been decided. l beg you, please don't kill us. . . l didn't even want to come! They forced me to come with them! Be quiet! Now, all of you close your eyes and put your hands up in the air. And now... Ah! Ah! Ah! Sarah! So you were the ghost?! Yes! l was in my room reading when l thought of dressing up and scaring all of you. And l must admit it was worth it! You don't know how funny you all looked. Your faces white with fear and your voices pleading for mercy... l've never had so much fun! Yes, but you gave us all a big shock! Yes, but if it's made the old Sarah come back, then long live ghosts! Do you believe in ghosts? l do. You know, once when l was teaching in England l was in a mansion, a beautiful old house in the country, and they told me that every day, in one of the rooms in a mansion there was a breeze which passed through the room, every afternoon at four o'clock. And they said it was a friendly ghost. A she, a woman, who haunted the house, every day she passed through the room at four o'clock on the dot. l believe in ghosts. They're all in Scotland and Britain l think, in general. Now, l want to do something with you in this lesson, related to English adjectives, if you look at this bag, if you want to describe this bag, you could say it's big, you could say it's brown, it's useful, it's casual. So these are a few adjectives which you could use to describe the bag. Now the problem is, if you want to use more than one or two adjectives before the noun, how do you order them? Do you say 'it's a big, casual, useful, brown bag'? Or 'it's a brown, big, casual, useful bag'? That's the problem. Well, in English there is an order, a specific order, which we now are going to look at on the screen together, so that you can decide every time you're using adjectives, what order to put them in. Let's take the bag, so look at the screen, the first adjective that we would say is the adjective of opinion. So, adjectives of opinion are for example, 'interesting, boring, fascinating' in this case 'useful', ok? Or even 'casual'. Then we talk about the dimension or the size, so it could be 'big, small, thin, thick', in this case the bag is 'big'. After we talk about the age, is it 'new', is it 'modern', is it 'ancient', is it 'old'? And l think we could say about this that it's a 'new', more or less, a new bag. So, so far, we have a 'useful, big, new bag'. Then we talk about the shape. This bag is 'square', it could be 'oval', it could be 'round'. So you've got shape, then we talk about the colour, for example 'pink, blue, light green, brown'. After that the origin, is it 'French'? 'English, American, ltalian', ok? And then the material it's made of, if it's 'wooden, plastic, woollen, cotton' in this case. So, if we want to describe this bag using all those adjectives, it would become this: it's, opinion, 'a casual, big, new... follow the screen... new, square, brown, ltalian, cotton bag' ok! Now, we don't usually put eight or nine adjectives before the noun, but if you do want to use three or four, then that's the order which you follow. And remember that in English all adjectives go before the noun, not after, because in some languages you can put adjectives before the noun and adjectives after the noun. However, in English the rule is: adjectives always before the noun, ok? Great! So that's the lesson about adjectives and l'll see you very soon, bye! Welcome to 'Cooking Today'! Hi, Lisa. Good to see you. Good to see you again, Nancy. Lisa, tell us what you're going to talk about this time. l've chosen a letter in particular. . . l've received so many! Here we are. . . lt comes from Lynn: 'Dear Lisa, you're the person l most admire in my life. . . Please help me! My husband has decided to invite his boss and wife for dinner, and l've no idea how to arrange a formal table setting!' Husbands can be so insensitive. Well, dear Lynn, you don't need bone china, silverware or crystal to set an attractive table! Where does one begin? l'd start with a table covering. The ideal tablecloth for formal dinners is a damask one, or a cloth with delicate embroidery. Can it be placed over a bare table? You'd better place a protective padded cloth underneath. What do you think about place mats? They're acceptable for every occasion except formal dinners! And table runners, aren't they pretty? They are, and very trendy nowadays, since they come in a wide range of colours! Now, tell us about napkins. They're usually sold as a coordinated set with tablecloths. She's not supposed to use paper napkins, l suppose. Oh, it's considered a bit crass! You can use paper napkins for picnics. ls a napkins ring necessary? Why not? ln the past each family member would have one, either of wood or engraved silver. Today they're available in many materials and styles. Now. . . What about dinnerware? l think that a set of one-colour dishes would be very smart. Round plain plates, a side plate and serving dishes are perfect. What about glassware? The best for formal dinners is a long stemmed goblet of medium height. Lynn will need a wine glass, a water glass and a flute for champagne. And cutlery? How do you arrange forks and knives? Forks are placed to the left of the plate, spoons and knives to the right, with the blade facing the plate. At the top of the plate you'd place dessert forks and spoons. Of course, carving forks and knives are necessary when serving roasts. l see. . . How do you feel about centrepieces? Well, a basket filled with fresh flowers would smarten the plainest of tables! You can also use candles. lt's a real work of art! Yes! And a pretty setting makes food taste better. Thank you Lisa for this informative chat. lt was a pleasure. Now, let's see which terms Lisa used to talk about table setting. First of all, she said there are different kinds of 'table coverings', a 'tablecloth' is what we use to cover the table with during meals; 'place mats' are individual settings for more informal meals; 'table runners' are long and narrow pieces of fabric which can hold several places. A 'centrepiece' can be placed in the middle of the table, usually with fresh flowers, as decoration. lf you want to protect your table from stains or heat, you'd better place a 'protective padded cloth' under the table cloth! A 'napkin' is what we use to wipe our mouth with, while eating. Today 'paper napkins' are rather convenient, but don't use them when Lisa is invited! A 'napkin ring' is a ring of different materials, fabric, wood, silver, which allows people to identify their personal napkin during family meals. Now, let's go to 'dinnerware', or 'dinner service', also called 'crockery': all 'plates', 'side plates' or 'serving dishes' used for meals. 'Glassware' refers to glasses, that can be 'wine glasses', 'water glasses' or 'flutes' used to drink champagne. A 'stemmed goblet' is a tall glass with a stem, used in formal dinners. 'Cutlery', commonly referred to as 'silverware', refers to forks, spoons and knives. 'Serving forks' and 'spoons' are used to serve food from the serving dish. That's all for this time. See you again next week. lt's the new frontier of retailing! lt's revolutionised the way we do business and it brings in customers from all over the world! Of course l'm talking about e-commerce. l'm Eric Brown and this is 'Let's talk', the discussion programme with our commentators Tom and Marie. Good evening everyone. Good evening. Well, what are your thoughts on e-commerce? Do you buy things online? Of course l do! l always book low cost flights and l also buy DVDs and books on the lnternet. As most people do, l shop online not only for the convenience, but also to pay the lowest price possible on any given item. l used to visit different websites to shop around for the lowest price, but now that automatic comparison shopping is possible my browser automatically shows me the prices for the same DVD at different online stores on the web. l can easily compare prices and choose which one to buy. Marie, did you know that you're a typical online shopper? ln fact 52% of online shoppers buy books, 41 % buy leisure and travel items, including holidays and flights, and 40% buy DVDs and CDs. Well Eric, online shopping is very popular today. ln the UK, for example, 48% of people regularly shop on the lnternet. Did you know that economists put the value of online shopping in the UK at $2.26 billion and that the e-retail market is growing by 32% a year? Actually, that doesn't surprise me! E-commerce is having a huge impact on the way we do business. lt's increasing markets, improving efficiency and effectiveness and is transforming business processes. Tom, why are you so quiet? What do you think about e-commerce? Well, to tell you the truth l'm very sceptical about e-commerce, for many reasons... Why exactly are you sceptical? Well, let's start with the issue of security! Credit card details can be stolen and it's possible to order goods from bogus companies, ones that don't really exist. There are also lots of scams to trick people into handing over their login details for online banking; and then their accounts are emptied. So, according to you, buying things online is risky? Yes, also you can't be sure you'll get the goods you ordered and if there's something wrong with them, who pays for the goods to be returned? You do! Tom, l agree with you but up to a certain point. There are some problems with e-commerce, but these problems aren't stopping people from spending more and more online. At the same time e-commerce has many advantages for business people. Could you explain some of these advantages, Marie? Well, it's cheaper for a retailer to set up a website than it is to rent a shop, fit it out and pay someone to work there. Besides, a website has global reach, so customers can come from all over the world. Ok, ok! An interesting discussion but l'm afraid yet again we've run out of time! Once again l like to thank our commentators. - Thank you! And goodbye to everyone; and see you again next week for another edition of 'Let's talk'. The topic today was e-commerce, electronic buying and selling. More specifically we spoke about e-retailing and online shopping. Retailing is the selling of goods directly to consumers. Consumers are the people who buy goods. 'Online' means with the lnternet. So online shopping is buying things on the lnternet. The e-retail market, that is the selling of goods online, is growing. Well, online shopping has its positive aspects and negative aspects. Marie said you can find the lowest price thanks to 'automatic comparison shopping'. 'Automatic comparison shopping' means your browser, the programme you use on the lnternet, automatically shows you the prices of the same products at different online stores. An online store is a virtual shop on the web. The web is another word for the lnternet. With this kind of shopping you don't have to shop around. 'To shop around' means visit different shops to look for the lowest price. lt's cheaper for retailers, people who sell goods to consumers, to set up a website than to fit out a shop. 'To set up a website' means to develop a website. Notice how we say 'to fit out a shop', this means to make a shop ready for use, for example add shelves, lights, mirrors. Tom, on the other hand, is sceptical about e-commerce. This means he has doubts. He says online shopping is a risk. There are lots of bogus companies, these are companies that don't really exist. And lots of scams. A scam is a trick to steal money from people. Again we have run out of time! 'To run out of something' means you have finished it. So goodbye and see you again soon! Now let's watch the whole episode together, watch the subtitles carefully because the language points that we've studied together are highlighted, alright? Enjoy your viewing!
