It's become my ritual. Putting the layers on. Every mask has a function. The eyes. The cheeks. The lips. This mask is about preservation. It's a solitary retreat. I expect premium service from my medical insurance and you're giving me substandard care. Well, is she even qualified? If I'm found dead in my bed, you'll know who's to blame. Seriously, this woman. I'd rather be in cold Scotland than tabloid bait in London. - Mrs Ghent? - What is it? How are you feeling? Hello? Hello? Balls. Have you eaten? You need to have food before you have pills. I'll skip the food. Will you all please stop telling me what to do? Tramadol. Breakfast of movie stars. Forgotten ones, obviously. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right, Veronica. Ow. Careful. Sorry. It's too soon for you to be wearing prosthetics. What would you know? Is it a hotel? No, it's a retreat. A solitary retreat. Solitary, as in no one? That is the accepted definition, yes. You should be resting at home. I signed a waiver. Don't worry. You're off the hook. Why are we going so far away? Precisely because it is so far away. I like to be left alone, really. Tell me if you have any pain or discomfort. Do I look like an infant? - You've just had... - A mastectomy. Not a lobotomy. All I need from you are bandages and the occasional bath. Understood? Of course. Welcome. You missed the housekeeping tour, but there's still some champagne. The other guests are in the gallery. Other guests? I don't do groups. I'm afraid the solo retreats only run in the summer. They alternate with silent yoga. A-ha! Oh, my gosh. Friends, friends, friends. Let us welcome La Dama. Is that an actress? Last but not least. Navajo Frontier. And you are? This is Tirador, the artist. I'm Arturo Tirador. I prefer to think of myself as a teacher. My homeopath told me this was a women's retreat. Don't be fooled by the flowers. I'm a feminist. For our website. Art purifies the soul. Frees the body, not just the mind. It's such an hon our to meet you. - Navajo Frontier was... - I was just trying to remember. The authenticity. The pathos. I have so many questions I need to ask you. Oh, God! This is a nightmare. Keep these people away from me. Please. Mrs Ghent has a headache, please. There's nothing to stop people having good manners. Tell the chauffeur we're leaving. As film legend, Eric Hathbourne, was due to receive a knighthood for his services to film and TV, he comments, "I always look to the future and right now, for me, that's the remake of 'Navajo Frontier'." The 1969 film famously starred iconic 13-year-old Veronica Ghent. The retired and controversial star, who recently underwent a successful operation was not available for comment. Sources close to her indicate she will be spending some time in an undisclosed retreat to recover. The question now is who will be able to fill her shoes? The nationwide search for young actresses between ten and 14 is well underway, as hundreds of hopefuls line up in front of the studio. Couldn't my daughter easily play that role? More this Thursday with Podrick Lochran. This is a black spot. Offer you a land line, but the poles have blown down. Problem? I need to... We need to leave. My patient, Mrs Ghent, isn't feeling well. She might feel better by morning. The pyramid is life. We begin on all fours and rise to a single point. I take the energy into myself. I give it to you. Take it. All the roads are flooded. We can't go yet. You wanna see how you feel tomorrow? Christ. What are they doing? You might have noticed it's raining. You're gonna need boots. If you've not got boots, there's boots by the door. This is the Highlands. Go wandering in the mountains alone at your own risk. It's a dark field. The water supply comes from a spring, so don't be surprised if there's peat in it. You're gonna be drinking it anyway. - How revolting. - Enjoy. Enjoy? Just need the famine, the pestilence. We'll have our very own apocalypse. Did she say "dark field"? Friends, friends, friends, friends. The gods are honouring us with a once-in-a-hundred-year storm. The stars are aligned. Gie dreich. Stoating's stopped. So, is everyone else staying in the main house? Aye. It's just yo use out here. What's that? Nighean's Wall. Commemorating the burnt. Aye, there's about 3,000 tried in these parts. Creepy. It's not creepy. It's tragic. It was the year of the last burning. Two man-eating women lived in this place. Mother and daughter. Real cosy. Here. Goodnight. Charming. Scout camp. With a touch of Guantánamo. No point. It's a dark field, remember? We really are in the middle of nowhere. Like the beginning of one of those horror movies. The young ingénue, you, is brought somewhere remote to be sacrificed in an horrendous way. To feed an aging community that refuses to die. That sounds a lot like Homerton Hospital on a Monday. - Can I help you? - No. Are you sure? I'm here to help. Just leave me... alone. Okey-do key. You just give me a holler if you need anything. Oh, don't wet your bandages. Would you do anything? Nica? You really scared me there. I don't know. It just... It hit me. This feeling. I'm just glad you're all right. I'm gonna get my medical bag. Oh. Gross. Fuck. You gotta be kidding me. Yes! How are you feeling? God, there was mud everywhere when I woke up this morning. I had a strange dream. It was so real. Did you take the Ambien? No. No need. It is very common for people to have anxiety around sleep in recovery. You wanna tell me a little bit about your dream? I'd like a coffee instead. OK. Shall I help you do your hair? I like your necklace. It's my mother's. Painting this morning. "En plein air." "Technique advocated by the French Impressionists." Fresh air will be good for you. - It might even be a bit of fun. - Wouldn't be fun at all. God forbid. How do you take it? One sugar. You should go. You came all this way. - For God's sake. - What else are you gonna do? I am not going to do the wretched group activity. Anyway, what do they call that haircut? Anarchist with a day job? I don't think this is a day job. This place feels familiar. As if I recognise it. As if I've been here before. I told you it would be good for you. What are you singing? Don't know. Just popped into my head. You're pretty talented. I'm not. You could do something with that. No, I couldn't. Look at you. You could be anything. No, I couldn't. Buenos dias. - Good morning. - Morning. Oh, can you get my glasses? I'm literally drawing blind here. Now, remember, don't draw the landscape. Let the landscape draw you. Fire. Fuego. Fire is the blood of the earth. And this, this charcoal comes from this land. Use it. Feel this view with your heart, with your whole body. Feel the energy of the earth pass through your feet, through your toes, up your legs, your sexual organs. All that baggage, throw it away. Shh, shh. Ah, the shrill mating call of the female divorcee. Penetrating an otherwise tranquil vista. The tranquillity is an illusion, dear lady. One hundred years ago, this whole area was a hive of industry. Charcoal mounds on every hill. Smoke, sweat and fire. You'd never guess. It's so, er... Alive. I was going to say peaceful. And then of course, there were the women who used to come here for... therapeutic purposes. Why? The earth was thought to have healing properties due to the very high proportion of human ashes from the women who were burned as witches. Oh. Continue! Actually, cremated remains are not without their nutritional value. Calcium phosphates, sodium and potassium nitrates, carbon. Depends on the original body composition. Can we please stop talking about this? It's not very conducive. You can't take the man out of the classroom... - Is everything all right? - Won't she ever stop talking? A-ha! - You work here? - Aye. What's your excuse? You should have knocked. My mistake. How do you like the cabin? Not a lot of people use it. I didn't imagine it was very popular, especially with the mud leakages. Yeah, along with everything else. What? You know, the, er... The rumours. - Old wives' tales. - Love those. Yeah, I know. It's a pretty ridiculous weapon. - Owen, by the way. - Right. Desi. You find yourself at the pub later, I'm buying. - Which pub? - Which pub? Good one. I'll see ya. It's important to leave your mark on the land. Here are your glasses. I don't know what to make of it either. It's different. Sorry. Time to go. One of yo use needs a lift? I'll walk. Hey. Would you go back and relive your childhood if you could? Not even if you paid me. Would you? I'll walk back to the cabin on my own. I know. Let's play blind man! Turn east, turn west, turn around three times and catch me. Here I am. Do you think I'm pretty? Let's play blind man. Turn east, turn west, turn around three times and try to catch me. I want to cry. Mrs Ghent. Are you OK? Come on. Come on. This way. Any pain? Every pain. I'm having dark thoughts, though. It's normal. Everyone has them. I mean, really dark thoughts. You need to rest. This time, take these. They'll help you sleep better. Come on. Goodnight. I'll see you in the morning. Thank you. Going live in five, four, three, two... He's made every film you've ever loved. We are delighted to welcome to "Late Night Live With Podrick Lochran" the incomparable Eric Hathbourne. So, Sir Eric, you've had a busy... Ah-ah, no. Not Sir Eric, just yet. Ah. You are a busy man. We're delighted to have you on the show. Thank you, I'm delighted to be here. And, yes, you're right. It's been quite a busy time. Yes, casting's started for the sequel to Navajo Frontier. And then of course there's your knighthood. Yes, well, that was totally unexpected and a complete surprise. I mean, I was thrilled, actually. You're often at the centre of the debate. Would you say you thrive on controversy? Oh, yes, actually, that's probably a good description. I like to rattle the cage. - Challenge the status quo. - Hmm, quite. And with the additional perspective on your career now, do you ever feel that you went too far? Oh, erm, no. Course I don't. No, I don't think I went too far. I think there are no limits to the exploration of the human soul. Let me rephrase that. In the course of your career, were you ever brought to do things that were unlawful? Absolutely not. I mean... No. And by the way, I know what you're doing here. - Move on! - Hold on. Veronica Ghent was 13 when she made Navajo Frontier with you. Yes, that's right. Absolutely. She was just... I mean... Look, I... I made her into something. Your relationship with her has been described... Now, please, don't make assumptions about that. It was a completely different era. No, what I'm saying is... we were very close. We had a sp... A special bond. A special bond. It will torture you. Nica? Are you OK? Oh, God! Ah, now this is what I was hoping for! Bit of drama! Dear lady... Talk us through your process. It's not so much a process as... Instinct. What do the words mean? I've no idea. Gaelic. Iníon. In Scottish that word means "daughter". - Do you have children? - I hate children. Great, great, great. Now this is creating some very lively discussion. Now, we must explore... explore each other's energies. Erm, sorry, what's with all the, erm, phallic references? - What? - It means penis. - All right! - Foucault wrote of the male gaze that the act of seeing is neither transparent nor neutral. But an imposition of power. Millennia of patriarchy dictate how we see. Oh, God! Here we go. Do you have something to say? The patriarchy. The war cry of hysterical women. Biting the hand that feeds them. Oh, my God! - Did that hurt? - Of course that fucking hurt! My hand was on fire! I'll get my medical bag. We must all keep terribly, terribly calm. There was clearly white spirit on his sleeve. That farm woman said there was gallons of it in the Jeep. - At least I think she's a woman. - What are you looking for? Some form of beverage with alcohol content. That's not advisable. Desi, if you think you're gonna survive this shit-storm called life by doing what's advisable, you are seriously mistaken. You have to be all teeth. Claws. Trust me. The bastards will stop at nothing to grind you down. Come on. Let's take your blood pressure. Shall I? Odd... how androgyny is so attractive in the young. So repugnant to the old. Have you noticed how the wind here sounds like whispers? Yeah, it does, actually. This place is beautiful. Dark, though. Even the daylight's dark. No, not dark. Dreich. Dreich. I like that. Maybe you could stay. I feel as if it's giving me a second chance. - Do you think that's possible? - Of course. You will get better. Imagine that. To be able to love without ghosts in your bed. Look in the mirror. Feel hopeful. Clean the bastards out of you. When my mom died... I thought... I could just forget about the blacking out, hospital visits... the screaming, the collapsing. Thought I could just pretend that it wasn't real. Pretend I was loved. I tried that route. Did it work for you? What's this in your eyes? I feel fine. Would it be all right if I went to the pub in the village to use the WiFi? I'm going to have an early night. I won't be late. Be as late as you like. Found it then, huh? What'll you have? I put you down as a gin-and-tonic kind of girl. You're kind of pretty when you smile. You know that? Thanks. Gin and tonic it is. Hey, Tom. Can I get a gin and tonic and a beer? Cheers, mate. Pay next time, yeah? - Here we go. - Thanks. The female, having held out for so long... - Do you want another one? - No. I gotta go. - So soon? - I gotta work. Nice to meet you. You too. Hey. - Will you stay? - Why? It's disco night. They only grow here. Oh. They're peat, nice and special. You should try. Come on. Down the hatch. Hm. It's good, right? Oh. Gross. Hey, watch it. You all right? It's all right. It's witch feathers. Soot. From the charcoal burning. Oh. I don't feel too well. I'm sorry. Come here. Don't leave. I'm sick. Here, follow me. I know the way. It's fine. Hey. Don't be like that. Here, come here. Give me a kiss. - You're hurting me. - Give me a kiss. You're pretty when you're angry. You know that? - I said stop it! - Hey! Fucking bitch. Fucking bitch! Who the fuck was that? Desi! Help! Help! Mrs Ghent? Mrs Ghent? Veronica! What are you doing outside? Did you sleep out here? Pain's all gone. The pain's all gone. I feel different. Like it's something in the earth. Oh. I started having strange dreams, too. I don't even remember coming back last night. It's like... Like I'm losing touch with reality. Let's get you inside. How are you feeling? Let me get you to a doctor. Please. We need to leave. Desi, I want to stay. - Sit here for a minute. - What? What are you doing? It's for you. Why? I don't know. It's a common ritual human beings have. They give each other things. Generally a sign of affection. Oh, no, I... I can't. It was your mom's. Let me put it on you. Now you have to leave. - What? - And not come back. Now go. I said go. Please. Hey! Wait! Hey! Can you drive me to the station? I'll run you as far as the foot of the brae. The estate car is always there. The keys are inside. Thank you. Today we celebrate Ullachaidhean. The burning of the witch. The victory of reason against the demonic. Against the dark Lilith. Jesus. How could anybody allow that to happen? We all allowed it to happen. Nica? Oh, my God! Fucking bitch! Hello? Anybody around? Oh, fuck, Jesus. Oh, God. Christ. What do you want? What a night. Do you remember? You're a sick woman, Nica. I'm sick. No one's better placed to know why. All I wanted was good for you. You've changed everything in hindsight. Do you know what I want? I want the truth. Hmm? I want to wash you out. What...? I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry. You were always such a special girl. My special girl. I trusted you, you know. You knew exactly what you were doing, you ungrateful bitch! Oh. Oh, shit! No! Veronica? Veronica! Oh, come on! Come on! Wake up. Come on! Come on, come on. Come on, come on! What is reality? Where is it? Perhaps it's only ever... a longing. I'm glad. What? Glad. Glad... that you came back. Sapex Scripts
