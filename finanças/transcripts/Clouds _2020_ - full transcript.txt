Wanna know a little secret? Most teenagers out there feel like they're invincible. Not the Superman kind of invincible. The kind of invincible that tricks you into thinking tomorrow might be a better day to start chasing your dreams. Or, like you have an extra ten minutes to get somewhere when, clearly, you don't. - Okay. Front door service. - Thanks, Mom. I owe you. I'll put it on your tab. - Hey, could you grab my crutches? - Yep. Got 'em. - Have fun up there, okay? - All right. - Thank you. - There you go. - Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. - It's okay. Leave it! Okay. Go, go, go. I'll see you in a minute. Have fun. - 'Sup, Zach? - Hey. The truth is that even after four years and, like, 20-something rounds of chemo... I'm still figuring it out. Thank you. Thank you means leave. Stick to football. - Hi, Zach. - Hey, Mr. Reed. I don't wanna see some of y'all in a skirt again. Don't clap for them. Don't do that. Sorry about that. You know that was uncomfortable to watch. They didn't rehearse. Let's give it up for some students that actually rehearsed to put on a show for us. Give it up for the Stillwater High Topaz Dance Crew! And while there's a lot that I don't know at my age, what I do know is this: What some people take for granted, others are fighting for. And believe me, I'm a fighter. - Zach? - Hello. Where have you been? You know I like to make a big entrance. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm gonna throw up. We've been through this. Just breathe. I know. I know. It's just everyone... Everybody's killing it out there. Look at Amy. She doesn't even have to try. She was born graceful. I was born to fall on my face. You are painfully awkward. Shut up. Sammy. Hey. You sang it for me, and it was awesome. That's nice, but you are my best friend, so you are morally obligated to say nice things to me. Everybody else out there is not my best friend. If everyone else doesn't like it, then they're idiots. Sorry. - Just don't screw it up, all right? - Ha, that's not funny. God, this stage fright thing is so stupid. It's not stupid. Look, if you're not ready to go, then I will. - You will? - Yes. That's right. Keep it going. Come on. Let me hear y'all. All right. - Knock 'em dead, good sir. - You'll get 'em next time. I'm not gonna hold you guys... Hey, hey. Awesome performance. Really liked that leg flippy dippy spin move you did. Great form. Well, I really liked that flippy dippy thumbs-up thing you did. That was cute. Give it up for Sammy Brown, everybody! Sammy Brown! Mr. Weaver. Hello, Stillwater. Whoo! Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so, um... I know I can easily be mistaken for Sammy Brown. But those of you who are paying attention... um, may notice that she has slightly more hair than me. Actually, pretty much everyone in this school has more hair than me, now that I think about it. - Even Mr. Weaver. - Okay. Ah, ha ha ha ha ha! That's funny that he would crack that joke 'cause I actually volunteered to shave my head off for you. So you shouldn't be talking about me. And I'm not gonna lie to y'all. I won't do that for nobody else. I'm not getting paid for this. Just play your song. Yeah, I'm special. Yeah, Sammy! Sorry, just give me a second to get into character for this super serious song. Whoo! - Yeah, you are. - Yeah. What? Yeah. Okay. You sure know how to work a crowd. And way to own the shaved head. - There's no use trying to hide it, right? - Mm-hmm. Gotta say, interesting song choice. "Interesting" is an interesting word to describe someone's music, but okay. Well, it wasn't really your music. - Mom, it was fun. - Oh. Fun is great. I love fun. - You love it? - Love it. - Love fun. You're a cool mom. - I am. Thank you. So I found some of your lyrics when I was cleaning your room. - And you read them? - They weren't hidden or anything. They were definitely in my desk drawer. Which I have to open to put your stuff away. Anyway, the point is... I really like them. Cool. I'm glad you enjoyed them. It was seriously nothing. I was just bored. Not trying to be Ed Sheeran or anything. "Ed" who? Oh, is he that little redheaded fella? You're hopeless. Anyway, I'm just glad you're not trying to be Ed or anyone else. The world already has them. What would be great is if it had more of you. Just saying. I can clean my own room. Can I get that in writing? Hey, dork. Woo boo boop. Really? Okay, you're not even watching it. Oh, yeah, that is true, but, I mean, if you really want to, you could just say the magic words. You're so annoying. Those are not the magic words. Come on. You know 'em. I... love... Okay, whatever. - Aw, is that your girlfriend? - Stop! - Out! Out! - What? She's really pretty. Does she like your bald head? That's really nice. Come on, Zach. A picnic? It's getting kinda cold out for a picnic. I know. Okay? I panicked. I mean, you gotta give it to a girl that knows what she wants. I still don't understand why she'd wanna go out with me in the first place. Are you serious? You're bald. Among other things. Well, hair grows, first of all. And she knows you beat it last time. This round of chemo is basically just a formality. Yeah. Wait. How does she know that? Oh, she, like... She, like, messaged me or whatever. Just making sure that it was fine that you guys hung out, I guess. Why wouldn't it be? She's probably just trying to be nice 'cause she knows that we hang out a lot. Okay, well, you told her that we're basically like family, right? We've had our diapers changed together. You've wiped your boogers on me. I haven't done that in, like, weeks. So I'ma need you to calm down. - Feels like yesterday. - Well, I lied and I told her that you're super cool, so you're welcome. Anyway, I wrote a song. Okay. Can I hear it? What? Like right now? Yeah. Okay. - What's it called? - It's called "Blueberries." You can't judge it. You haven't heard it yet. I feel you judging it. It's an interesting choice to write a song about produce is all. Okay, folks. What do we think? Free concert? Just don't judge. It's, like, rough, but I... Okay, let's try it. - All right. Don't screw it up. - Thank you. - Good morning, folks. - Good morning. Okay. Are you seriously taking the poor girl leftovers? Yeah. If Amy's as perfect as I think she is, she'll appreciate the culinary masterpiece that is cold pizza. - Oh, did you say cold pizza? - Yeah. Toss me a slice for the road. - Ooh! Ah, there we go! - Thank you. Don't they feed you in college? You've done nothing but mooch since you got home. I do not mooch, I scavenge. You're all vultures. And as king of the castle, I claim dibs on all leftovers henceforth and hereto with. It should be illegal to make people work on a day as glorious as this. - He's got a date. - Oh. Nice. - Yeah. - Hey, your highness, don't forget Daisy. Oh, yes. Goodbye, trusty hound. - Rob, you're taking her to the groomer. - You didn't ask me to do that. Uh, yes, I did. On Tuesday when I made the appointment. I asked you if you were free. No, sorry. It's not on the calendar. I'm gonna take Grace to practice, and then I'm going straight to work. Well, I'm taking Zach to his date and then picking up his meds. I would take Daisy, but if I don't hit the road right now, - I'm not gonna make it to school in time. - What about Alli? I can't. I'm waiting on a call from Colin. Sam! You can't talk in the car? I can't FaceTime in the car. I haven't seen him in weeks. The base is super strict on guys in training. I don't like the sound of that cough. - Grace, let's go. - I'm fine. The hospital's on the way to the park. We'll just pop in and make sure. No, Mom. Seriously, I'm okay. No. Alli, your call's gonna have to wait. I need you to take Daisy. - But Mom... - Alli. Sorry, kiddo. - Come on. - Can we just go after the picnic? - No. Absolutely not. No! - Please, please, please? - We're not having an argument about this. - It's not that serious. - I'm fine. I'm seriously okay. - We're going to the hospital. Stop! All right. Drop it at the post office. Okay, the scan shows Zach has got a collapsed lung. But luckily, the pediatric surgeon has been able to move some things around, and we can get you in right now. Now? Can't we wait until later? It can't be that big of a deal. I feel fine. Your lung is leaking air and putting pressure on your heart. If we don't relieve it right away, you could go into respiratory failure - or cardiac arrest. - Mom? Okay, babe, it's gonna be okay. They know what they're doing. - Wait, Mom! - I love you! - Laura, I will be right back. - Okay. Lesions. Lesions? But you said the surgery was successful. We were able to fix the collapse, but I'm sorry. They show that the cancer has reached Zach's lungs. I don't understand. We were just given the all clear. As you know, osteosarcoma is very unpredictable and very resilient. - Then let's do another treatment. - Yeah. I'm afraid Zach's cancer no longer responds to treatment. Wait, what are you saying? Zach is terminal. How long? Oh, my God. Hey, babe. How long? Every case is different. There's no way to really know. Will I make it to graduation? If graduation is end of spring... It's hard to say. We're giving it six to ten months. I am so sorry. Mom, can I stop chemo? Hey, Eli. I heard you crushed it against South last week, man. Zach, sorry you couldn't make it. Yeah, me too, you know? It's just tough juggling high school with undercover assassin work. - Sorry. - My man. Ooh. Tess, I'm digging the new color. Do you mind if I steal that when this grows back? - You could pull it off. - Sweet. All right. See you, man. - I'll see you then. - Yeah, you will. Running for office? You know, just giving the people what they want. Subtle. You know she's in our next class, so you might have to tell her eventually. - I mean, you told me. - Yeah, that's different. You're family. Guess who's bizzack? What's going on, playboy? It's good to be back, old man. - Just hope there isn't a pop quiz. - Well, guess what? There might be a pop quiz 'cause you called me "old man." Have a seat. All right. And for your information, I'm middle-aged. Big difference. All right, everybody, put those phones down. Let me holla at y'all real quick. I know when you woke up this morning you wasn't sure what today was gonna be. But guess what? It's a special day. Today is the day we craft your college essays. Yay! Now look, I'm not trying to put no pressure on you at all. I'm lying. It's a lot of pressure. I mean, these essays can determine the whole trajectory of your life. And I'ma help you with that. Mr. Weaver's gonna help you write some of the best essays in the state. My classroom. Nobody else gonna care but us, but it'll be a big deal to me. So I came up with three questions to help you write the perfect college essay. What do you hope to accomplish in college? What do you wanna do once you get there? Do you actually wanna go there to learn, or do you wanna just go there and play around? Beer pong, physics? Think about that. What special attributes do you have that should qualify you for consideration? Why should a university accept you? What do you have to offer? And not even just to a university, to the world? What are your best attributes? And finally, the last question, and it comes from one of my favorite poets, Mary Oliver. What do you wanna do with your one, wild and precious life? Mary Oliver, one of the greats to ever do it. Think about that. You got one life to live. What are you gonna do with it? Now get to it. Zach, Zach, Zach. Hey. Um, is everything okay? I'm okay. Well, I'm really sorry about your emergency surgery. I'm sure that was, like, really scary. It's just the Zach Sobiech I know wouldn't leave a girl stranded at the park and never talk to her again. I'm terminal. You should... You should go. You're gonna be late. Zach? Honey, what are you... Baby, it's freezing. I'm gonna get you a blanket. Here. What happened? In Mr. Weaver's class, we were supposed to write a... a college essay. Mm-hmm. I mean... what's the point of writing a college essay when I'm never even going to make it to college? What's the point of anything now? Hon, what you're facing... knowing that your time is limited, it is... scary. And awful, and I hate it. I've been thinking lately that none of us are really promised tomorrow. We all just assume it's gonna be there. Maybe it's kinda like a painting. When you're standing too close to it... you can see dark bits, and you can see light bits, but... you don't really know what you're looking at until you take a step back. So maybe, as much as this sucks... maybe this is some kind of weird chance for you. To forget about all the superficial stuff that people waste their time on. You get to decide what matters most now. You get to choose what your painting's gonna look like. Catherine Latapie was the first person to be miraculously cured at Lourdes. She was healed of paralysis in 1858. Physical miracles are an extraordinary phenomenon. But many other pilgrims make their way to Lourdes for moral healing or spiritual comfort. Less spectacular miracles, perhaps, but nevertheless, important for those Catholics... What's that? Oh, it's... - Where were you? - Work. Just trying to catch up. What are you watching? I was thinking our family could really use a vacation. Vacation? Now? When else? Zach's always wanted to see the world. There's... There's a place in France, Lourdes. People say the water can be really healing. - That it's been curing people... - Water, really? He had 24 rounds of chemo. Yeah, I think I know how many rounds of chemo he's had. Well, then you know how much disappointment he's already had, - and taking him and dragging him... - We've all been disappointed. That doesn't mean we just give up on our son. I'm not giving up on our son. Okay? I just wanna save him from this crazy idea that a miracle could all of a sudden happen just 'cause we went across the fricking ocean for it. We need this. - Mom, I can't find my headphones. - Okay, troops, let's hit the road! - They're on the couch. - Bring on the quality family time. Yeah, I think Sam's only interested in quality time with the Moulin Rouge. Dude, that was supposed to be a secret. You're kidding, right? - So does that mean we can't go, or... - Come on, Grace. Are you sure we can't take Daisy? Honey, I promise the Schimnowskis will take good care of her. I just feel bad that we're going to be having fun without her. Geez, Grace, Daisy can have more fun shredding a roll of toilet paper than anyone's ever had in France. Hey, you leaving without saying bye? Amy, what? Uh, hi. Hey, Zach. Your hair looks good. Thank you. Yeah, it's surprising how fast it grows when chemicals aren't being pumped into your body. Here's the thing. I like you. And I know your diagnosis complicates things, but I can't help it. I don't care. So, um... - Amy, I don't think... - Do you like me? - Yes, I do, but... - Even though I don't have cancer? - Come on, Zeke. - Make your move, Romeo. - Be nice. - Sam! Maybe we should just kiss? Give the people what they want. Oh, no, the people do not want that. How did you even hear that? How about you just text me when you get there? Or I could just put you in my suitcase? You can come with us. - That is tempting. - Yeah. - Have fun. - All right, bye. - Bye. - Aw. - She's so pretty, Zach. - Shut up. You might wanna purify those thoughts before we get to Lourdes. I think she's staring at me. It's like a Catholic theme park. It really sucks what's happening to you. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder why it's happening to me. Like, out of all the people in the world. What did I do? - Did I piss off God somehow? - I don't think it works like that. Bad stuff happens to good people all the time. - Well, tomorrow's gonna be weird. - This whole thing is weird, man. She's still staring at me. I'm surprised that I haven't burst into flames yet. The night is young. - A lot of people here. - There are. You think they change out the water in between sessions? They don't change out the communion wine during cold season, so I doubt it. Zach, if something happens in there or if something doesn't... It's okay. I know. Careful, it's slippery here. Thank you. Oh. Ooh! That's cold. Come in. Bonjour. Sorry, just one second. I need to finish this thought. So nice to be missed. Okay. Hello. Shut the front door. Are you writing a song? Um, kind of. The beginning of a song. It's just lyrics right now, but yeah. What are you doing? I'm waiting for you to perform your song. - It's not quite ready. - What's it called? "Coffee Cup." - Interesting. - All right. I'll play you it, but please bear in mind that it's in a workshop stage. Um... Okay. That's all I have for now. Wow. Are you crying? No. No. You are. Dude, what happened in France? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I guess I just feel like there's this music in me... and it wants to come out. - Yeah, I know that feeling. - So, you'll help? With what? Writing more songs. Look, I know we've played other people's music before, but I was thinking it might be cool if we did something that was just ours. Zachary David Sobiech, I've only waited eight years for you to ask me that question! Oh, okay. Yes. Calm down. It's not that serious. It's not like I'm asking you to prom or anything. Well, good, 'cause I don't wanna limit my options too soon. You never know. Tom Hanks might walk right through that door in a white tux looking for someone to eat baby corn with. Just how many times have you watched Big now? Still not enough. Anyway, Amy told me that she was hoping that you would ask her to prom. - Crap. - What? I thought you liked her. Yeah, I do, but prom proposals are such a huge deal. First of all, it's called a promposal, okay? Second of all, if you ask her, she's gonna say yes. I just want it to be memorable. Jason Mraz. What about him? Well, I might've gotten tickets to his show at the Metro. - But, like, maybe... - What are you talking about? Maybe instead of taking me, you take Amy and ask her to prom there. - Well, can't we get an extra ticket? - For who? For you, dummy. There's no way I'm going to see Jason Mraz without you. That's just not gonna happen. I don't think you want a third wheel around for your big promposal. Stop saying that word. They are two separate words. Prom and proposal. And you're not a wheel, you're like a wing. - And Amy's becoming like my other wing. - Ew. If you say you need both of us to fly, I'm gonna barf on your blanket. - Together we will soar through the skies. - I'm barfing. Shut up! This has been sold out for months. How did you guys even do this? Um, I know a guy. I mean, we know a guy. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you serious? Hmm. Zach, what do you suppose all that hullabaloo's about up there? Gee, I don't know, Sammy. Maybe we should go take a gander. What did you do? So, Amy? Oh, my gosh. Are you that Amy? Say, "Yes." Well, I would, but it doesn't say who's asking. I, Zachary David Sobiech, am asking you, Amy Adamle... - Yes, yes, yes! Yes. - ...to please go to... - Oh, my hip. - I'm sorry. Ooh. That's sweet. Aw. Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Thank you so much, Minneapolis. I got one more song for you guys tonight. This is a love song, and it's really about giving yourself away. Not just to someone else, but to a higher something else. And basically saying, "I'm yours." Can you imagine hearing people sing your words back to you like this? I'd probably pass out. Sing it! Did you hear that? Rob. - Hear what? - Zach. Z, honey, do you need me to call an ambulance? Here, here, here. Try slow breaths, all right? Here. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Slow breaths. Count with me. One, two. Yeah, inhale slowly. - There we go. There we go. - Hey. - Did you give him something? - Yeah. - Can you get him back to bed? - Yeah. I'm gonna call the doctor. I got you. Hey, Sammy. - What? - Hey. Zach. Zach, Zach, what are you... It's 4:00 in the morning. What are you doing? Yeah, I know. Couldn't sleep. - You wanna make an album? - Like a real one? Yeah. Why not see if people actually wanna listen to our music? I was thinking we can make music videos too. - Put them up on YouTube, right? - Yeah. Right, Governor Bear? Oh, yes, Zachary David Sobiech. Right you are. - You're so handsome and smart. - Give him back. No. Zach, stop! - You're right about that, Governor Bear. - Give him back. Stop it. - What do we have here? - No, I got... I've got it! Zach! Zach, give it to me. That's not yours. "Don't wanna hold your hand in the hallway." Stop! Don't read that! "But I'd rather hold you here for now and always." Sammy Brown, you have a crush. - No, I don't. - Come on. Who's the lucky guy? - It's nothing. Stop. - Spill the beans. It's not that big of a deal. Come on. Who is it? Who is it? - Zach. - What? Sammy. Zach? I'm sorry. I wasn't... I wasn't trying to get you to confess or anything. - It's just... - It's fine. I guess I just thought that we'd... I don't know, like, have our first loves, and... go off to college, and then there'd be boyfriends and girlfriends. But then maybe one day when we're older... we'd, like... find our way back. Realize it was us all along. You know, I've thought about it too. You know, if... we were normal, then maybe that's how our lives would go. But... We're not normal. No, we're not. Think it's recording. - We'll find out later. - All right, let's do this. - Hello. - Hello. Hey! Oh, maybe pajamas. They're talking about me. Stop. Four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Hey! In today's video, we're gonna feature this all-new 2013 GT-R. It does zero to 60 miles an hour in 2.9 seconds. It is aggressive. It's exhilarating. It's scary... Hey. Is for horses. I've always wanted a horse. I never have, but if you want one, you shall have one, my dear. Oh, I missed you today at school. - What should we name it? - What? Our horse. Um... how about Felicity? Mm. I was thinking Roger. - A horse named Roger? - Yeah. And that way, we can name our daughter Felicity. Our daughter, huh? Our first daughter. How many daughters are we having? At least three, and then three boys. I always liked how even my family is. Six kids is a pretty tall order. I wonder when we should start trying. Amy Adamle... I would marry you today, if I could. It's not fair. I love you. You do? I do. I do. Z? Hello? Yes, I'm his mom. - How can I help you? - Yeah, you got it. What? How? Good morning. Good morning. Wow, you are so grounded. - That could work. - We fell asleep. Yeah, right. I need to think about it. Can I call you back? You too. Uh, Mom, did you know that Amy spent the night? It wasn't on purpose. I'm just gonna head home. My mom keeps on calling me anyways, so... All right. Thanks a lot, Alli. All right. I'll see you. Bye. Geez. What is the big deal? We were tired. We cuddled. "Cuddled"? Zach, Colin always stays in the basement whenever he's in town. Yeah, maybe Colin's less of a gentleman than I am. I think you mean more. Zach. - Mom, I'm sorry... - Have you looked on YouTube? - What? - Look at that. Look at it. - You have 20,000 views? - No way. - Seriously? For... For what? - Sammy... Sammy posted our video. I just talked to a journalist who said she saw your video - and she wants to interview you. - Why? Must be a slow news day. Shut up. Does she know about the cancer? She'd like to make it part of the story, which we can talk about. I dunno. I just... I don't wanna be some kind of sob story. Nobody sees you like that, and if they did, I would tell you. Yeah, but if this interview does happen that is what people will think. If you don't wanna do the interview, you don't really have to. Without doing anything, the video's already up to... - Holy Toledo. - How much? Fifty-one thousand. Are you serious? What are people saying? "They harmonize so well together. More songs please. Are they dating?" That was timely. The Internet's so weird sometimes. - What does that one say? - That one doesn't say anything. - Show me. - No, it's... It's kind of a dumb one. "You're not so special. Lots of kids have cancer." Yeah. That guy's obviously a very sad, lonely jerk. But you don't know that. He could be a very happy and popular jerk, like that guy from Grease. You don't always have to do that. Do what? You know, try to make something funny when it's not. No? Tough crowd. Zach. How's this for not funny? He's right. - There's nothing special about me. - That's not true. You should be happy. - This is a good thing. - Why? Because we have 51,000 views? - Who cares? - Because this is just the beginning. And what's the end? I thought this is what you wanted. What I wanted was to make an album, and then go on tour and then write more songs and make another album. But it doesn't really matter what I want, because it's not gonna happen, is it? Is this what you wanted? I mean, come on. What I want is to not have to lose my best friend. It's cool people like the video. You go, okay? I'll catch up. Just gonna sit here and bask in my newfound success. Sammy? Are you okay? The honest answer is... not even a little. Do you wanna talk about it? So what are we looking at? Don't you have class? Yeah, I do. I mean, I'm a teacher. But you know something? Screw that class. They can teach themselves. This is comfortable. How are you? I mean, I don't know if I've said this to you, but you... You look amazing with this head full of hair. Like, for real. You look like a model. Even though I miss you without eyebrows, though. There's something about you just having an alien face. You know, no eyebrows. Nobody could see your expressions. They don't know if you're surprised, or, "Is he happy?" - Do we know if... - It's a pretty good poker face, right? It's a great poker face. You should play in a bunch of poker tournaments, without eyebrows. They should do a poker tournament where everybody don't have no eyebrows. That would be crazy. That would be the longest game of poker ever. I'm off chemo. Is it because it worked, or... Or. You said "or," right? Or. You know you don't have to keep coming here, right? Um... Like, if you're not happy coming to school and being around all of this. You want me to quit? You know something? No. Come here. Yeah. That's right. I'm not saying you need to quit. Quitting is not an option, no. I'm just saying you need to re-prioritize. Look here, man. Look, you got something in there, right? You got so much in there that the world needs to hear. Now do me a favor. You go show Mary Oliver what's up. That's good. Does everybody have enough? - It's really good, Mom. - Thanks, honey. Ooh. Sour cream noodle bake? What's the occasion? Sorry if yours is a bit cold. It's been sitting there for a while. Zach, you want some broccoli? - I'm okay. - Hi. Oh, the cheese is perfect on this. Look at that. Look at that. Can you not look at me like that? Like what? Like your every happiness rests on me eating all the casserole. Like if I do, everything will be fine. News flash, everything is not fine. Zach. - Get up. - Dad, I'm sorry. - I'm in a weird mood. I didn't mean it. - I was gonna wait till tomorrow, but I think you need this tonight. Come on. Need what? Dad, come on. I'm sorry. - What's going on? - I don't know. Where are they going? It's a surprise. I don't like surprises. No way. No way! No, no, no, no, no. What? Are you kidding me right now? Is this really happening? Oh, my... This is insane. Did I just, like... die and go to heaven? - Uh, that is not funny. - I'm not trying to be funny. I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that there is a GT-R sitting in our driveway right now, Alli. - You like it? - Do I like it? Are we, like, rich and didn't know it? - No, we are not rich. - Don't worry. I didn't buy it. I borrowed it from Mike, from the dealership. He cleared it so we could drive it for a week. So you could drive it for a week. Just don't scratch it, okay? No way. Thank you so much. - This is so cool. Thank you. - Yeah. Can we take it for a spin? Can you wait till the morning, or at least grab a coat? - Please. - It's a performance car with a heater. Besides, I need a ride. I have something I really need to do. Can I go next? No, honey. Not now, all right? No way! Oh my, gosh. This is so cool. All right, start up. Start up. Oh... - Whoa! - Whoa! - Yeah. That is great. Yeah. Let's go. - Still got it. - Did you play drums? - Uh, close. Trumpet. Oh, you were such a nerd. Little bit. Here comes my favorite part. You needed doughnuts? It was an emergency. I still can't believe you did this. I just wanted you to be able to take Amy out on a date in a proper car, you know? I always wanted a cool car to pick your mom up in. Do you ever feel the way about mom like how I feel about Amy? How's that? Like you couldn't breathe without her. Like she's the only thing that makes sense in this whole messed-up world. Yeah, I guess so. How about now? I don't know. I mean, we love each other very much. But as you get older, you know... things pile up, and other things get in the way. Am I one of those things? Zach. Nice ride. Hey, thanks. I called her. Thought you'd want to show the car off, you know. Get a minute alone so don't come home too early. - Hello. - Hello. - There you go. - Thanks, Mr. Sobiech. - Bye. - Have fun. Ooh ooh. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Ah, yeah. Yeah, one second. That was a direct hit to the tumor. - That was my bad. - Cancer is such a buzzkill. Could you... Could you grab that really quick? You gonna play me something? Maybe. Thank you, me lass. This is for you. I'm sorry. I want you to remember this, okay? This is yours. All of it. And I'm yours. Is that from the picnic? Um... Yeah. Okay. You okay? Yeah. Hey. - I'm sorry. - Hey, hey. Are... Hey, hey. Hey, hey. It's okay. Look, we can... - We can just talk. - No, no, no. - No, I mean... Well... - I have to go. Well, the other day I was thinking, since we're going to have, like, six kids, we might want, like, an Olympic-sized pool. I mean, what do you think about chickens? And we... Please stop! It's never gonna happen. Zach! Zach. Zach, stop. Zach, please. - Wait. Come here. - Stop! Please, stop! I have nothing to give you! - No kids, no ring, no future, nothing. - Zach! Zach, come on. Let's get inside. - I have nothing. - Zach. Zach, just get inside. Please, Zach. Come on. Zach! Zach, stop. Just stop the car. Zach, stop. Why? What did I do? He's really in love with her. He told you that? Said he couldn't breathe without her. Wanted to know if I ever felt that way about you. What'd you say? I said, "Of course." What? - You haven't looked at me in months. - Of course I have. - Barely ever. - That's not true. - Why didn't you tell me about the car? - I didn't know it was going to happen. You didn't think I might want to be a part of that? Since when do you care about cars? I don't care about cars, Rob. That's not the point. The point is, you didn't include me. You didn't think about me. This is about you now? Are y... Yes. You know what? It is about me. And it's about you, and it's about the fact that you haven't said one word to me in months that wasn't about money or some other stupid thing, that has nothing to do with the fact that our son is dying, Rob. I know he's dying! Our son is dying, and you won't even look at me! - Calm down. Just calm down. - Don't tell me to calm... I'm not gonna talk to you if you just want to fight. I'm not looking to fight. I'm looking for literally anything from you. Well, I don't got anything to give you, okay? I had Zach back for a minute tonight. Did you see the smile on his face? My own boy's getting weaker every day and... I can't do nothing about it. I know. Why are you on the floor? 'Cause sometimes laying in bed makes me feel sick. Oh. Mom wants you upstairs. Can you just tell her I'm sleeping? Mr. Weaver's here too. Hey. What's going on? Um, they won't tell me, but your mom called me this morning. Mr. Weaver has some exciting news for you. Yes, about your music. Okay, what about it? Well, I gave your video to BMI. - BMI, the music company? - Yes. Wait, how? Oh, don't do me like that. I know people. See, they wanna sign you and Sammy as songwriters. - That's a joke. No, what? - Are you serious? Is this... What is this, some sort of Make-A-Wish thing, or... - Stop. - No. They really dig your music. And they're flying us to New York this weekend. - Oh... Wait, me too? - What? - Yes. Of course. Of course. - Yeah? Okay, great. Yes. And look, I know it's a lot to take in right now. Okay, just because of everything that's happening, but like Einstein said, "In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity." Maybe this is yours. Do you have a book of quotes you read every night before bed? I think he's trying to tell you, like, thank you. - Thank you so much. This is crazy. - Thank you for that. That's what I meant. Thank you. All right. Seriously. This is so cool. - New York. Wanna... - What? - Wanna go? - Yeah, sure. Rihanna, Beyoncé, every Backstreet Boy there ever was. Every single person we know has walked through these doors, and now it's our turn. - Are we that iconic? - Yeah, I think so. I am so thrilled that Milton sent us your link. He's been talking about you guys for months. "Milton"? Weaver, your teacher. - No. Really? - Wait, Mr. Weaver's name is Milton? Oh, hey. Okay, wait, you did not hear that from me, all right? God knows he got enough grief for that at school. - Yeah, of course. Lips sealed. - We won't tell all of our friends. Mom, Dad, we have some paperwork for you to sign. And give me a sec. I'll go make sure we're ready. Okay. Have fun. This is crazy. Wow. This is some life-changing stuff. To life-changing stuff. Give it up for A Firm Handshake, everybody. Come right over here. - It's so nice to meet you. - Hi. - Thanks for having us. - Lookit! - That is us. - That is us. Official caps. - Oh, yeah. - Look at these. - Here's the official contract. - For sure. Already read it. - Hey, we did it. - You did one! Are you okay with all this? Yeah. I am. - Can I squeeze in here? - Hey, I'm short. I'm short. Ready? A Firm Handshake on three. One, two, three. A Firm Handshake! - Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hey, Sammy. - Mm-hmm? Can we swap seats? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. I'm really sorry if there's any drool on that seat. - No, it's okay. - Okay. - Hey. - What's up? It's just been such a whirlwind, I feel like we've barely spoken. Yeah. It all feels like some crazy, vivid dream, right? Yeah. It is a dream. You just get to be awake for it. Broke up with Amy. What? Oh, hon, I'm sorry. - You okay? - Not really. I think I really messed up. And I miss her. Mm. Feel like she had this rope. Kept me from falling down a dark hole. Are you going to be sick? - I'm sorry. Do you have a pen? - What? Excuse me. I'm sorry. - Do you have a pen, by chance? - No, I h... Sorry. I... Yes, here. What's up? You okay? Yeah. I'm fine, I just... I need to write this down before I forget. - Yeah, recording now. - Okay. - This is insane. - This is weird. All right, Zach. You ready? Uh, yeah, ready. Uh... Sorry. Sorry, could we try that one more time? Of course, man. Just take a deep breath. You got this. - Okay. - You good? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Just breathe, remember? Okay. I'm ready. Here we go. They don't know how to use the Internet. - Do you know the password? - I just typed it in. See? - Sorry. - Scroll down. - Right there. - Whoa, wicked. - There it is. - Yes. - Us. At the same time. Yeah. - Same time? - One, two, three. - Here we go. His courage in the face of his terminal cancer is even more inspiring. And somehow in the middle of all this, you started the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund. Money from our music, I'd like it to go to research, so that other kids like me with Osteosarcoma can hopefully have a full childhood. And who knows? Maybe our music can help find a cure. Next up, the Lakeland teenager who composed and recorded "Clouds." ...the inspiring song written and performed by Zach Sobiech. Hey, Anne. Wait, what? - Yes, they're playing "Clouds" now. - Are you kidding? Okay. Okay. Wait a minute. Are you crying? Dan is officially crying in the studio. How are you not crying? It's a beautiful song and a beautiful story. Oh, my gosh. It's Minnesota's own Zach Sobiech. This is "Clouds." Oh, my gosh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My son is on the radio! Oh, my gosh. My son is on the radio. Zach is on the radio. My son is on the radio! Sammy! Sammy! You're on the radio! We're on the radio? Go, go. Quick! It's real? Is it still on? Says the Vikings are gonna have a pretty good year. They say that every year. - Could be real this year. - Oh, my gosh! - Zach! - Zach! Your song! - You're on the radio! - It's on the radio! - On the radio? - Yes. KS95. KS95. Do you have a radio? Just change it to KS95, please. I can do it. No. You got it? I'm on the radio! I'm on the radio! I'm on the radio! Oh, my gosh. We're on the radio. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! - Hello, relatives. - Hi. Hey. Well, well, well. What have we here? I see you got a new jersey. - Yeah. - It's a pretty interesting number choice. - Shh. - That's actually my number. So what? Weird coincidence. Grace, are you trying to tell me that I'm your inspiration? It's just a number. You can just come right out and say it. - Alli, phone. - You can just tell me. - I'm just gonna pause the movie. - You, starts with an "I", - ends with an "ove." - Hello? - Love this movie. - Put 'em together. Yes, I do. So, how about you be quiet and we watch it? - Or you can just admit that I'm your idol. - Zach. Zach. It's for you. - It's the Metropolitan. - It's the Metro? - Wait, what? - Why are they calling you? I don't know. Hello? Yeah, this is Zach. - Wait, what? - The Metro, Metro? Oh, my gosh! - And guess what? - What? They also want you to play. Hello? Sammy, are you alive? Hello? Are you him? You know... Yeah. That's my... That's my song. I'm Zach. - It's my favorite song. - Oh, yeah? Are you gonna die? Uh, yeah. I am. My cat died, but it's okay. He's come back as a tree. Oh. Janie, hey. Come on. It's time for class. Amy, look, it's Zach. He's famous. He is, huh? So famous my mom dropped me off. Rock and roll, baby. Bye, Zach. - Bye. - Bye, Janie. - Hey. - Hey. I know I don't really have the right to be asking for any favors... but I kinda need a ride somewhere. Um... what are we doing here? I'm apologizing, and hopefully you're listening. I couldn't stand to see you in so much pain... and knowing that I was the reason. I just thought that if I gave you space that... I know you were trying to protect me but... you really hurt me. I'm so sorry. I can be really dumb sometimes. I love your song. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm, I do. It's about this girl. She's all right, I guess. So, the Metro wants me to play. What? Well, are you gonna do it? I can't do it without you. I need you. And I know it's selfish after everything that I put you... It isn't selfish, you nerd. And if it were, then I'd be the most selfish person on the planet because... I am in love with you... on, like, an exaggerated level, Zach Sobiech. I love you too. What are you doing? What? It's a baby horse. Come here! His name is Roger. Hi, Roger. - Should I go in? I'm going in. - Hey, you. Yeah. Go for it. I'm touching it. Hello. Oh, my gosh. - Is that better? - Yeah. - Comfortable? - Yes. Besides the itch on my nose. Oh, where? Where is it? Mom, I was kidding. I can still scratch my own nose. You brat. Okay. Should we just get this over with? What? This fun little list the doctor gave us. We don't have to do that now. You still have time, hon. It's not that bad. Come on. I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna say goodbye. I think goodbyes can wait. Okay. Good. Okay. "How and where do you wanna die?" Skydiving in Florida. And if that doesn't work out, is there a plan B? Gee, I hadn't really thought about a plan B. Mm... I wanna be alert enough to say a proper goodbye. And I don't wanna be in the hospital. I just feel really disconnected. Maybe I could just be here. On the couch. So I can play Xbox. Okay. Um... Organ donations? Yeah. Whatever they can use. Have you thought about your funeral? - We don't have to do this, we can... - Bagpipes. What? I want bagpipes. Okay. And no Psalm 23. It's overdone. I want the gospel about the talents. That one makes sense to me. Yeah. And no suit. I feel like it would just be too uptight-looking. Maybe, like... tie and my vest. - I like your vest. - Yeah, me too. And maybe these. I think they really make my eyes pop. Oh, my word. Okay. What next? - Did you shoot any three-pointers? - Yeah. Did you shoot any touchdowns? - No, I got a hole in one. Yeah. - A hole in one? - All right. Here, have some salad. - He's too tired to come up. Oh. Um... do you guys want me to leave? I can... What? No, Sammy, course not. - Water? - Thanks. What's... What's going on? We spoke with the doctor today, and he thinks... He's not sure if Zach's gonna make it to prom. That's, like, a month away. I know it's hard to hear. We wanted to discuss it with you, uh... ...because we all know how much Zach has been looking forward to prom. Right? Especially since he and Amy got back together, and we were hoping that maybe we could find a way to still give him that. How? Well, we thought we would throw him a party. The best party ever. Birthday, graduation, prom. Everything he's ever gonna miss, all rolled into one. What do you think? Sounds good, right? - I mean, he loves a party. Right? - Yeah. What if we did it at the Metro? It's only a couple weeks away. - Yeah. - That's a great idea. Yeah, maybe you and Amy could get the whole school to come. - Yeah. - We can get the whole town to come. I could call the radio station, get them involved. He'll love that. He will love it. - Everyone's coming. Okay? - He'll like that. He's gonna love it. - Great. Pass the potatoes? - Yeah. Thank you, honey. Okay. Okay, great. So we'll see you there? Oh, wonderful. Thank you. Michelle? Hi. Laura Sobiech. Yeah, I wanted to let you know we're having a celebration for Zach... Hi. Okay, this is for you. I think this one is yours. You got this. We're gonna learn this tonight. Thank you guys so much for coming. How did you do that many? I don't... - Are you struggling? - Yeah, a little bit. Sorry. Sorry, guys. Can we start from the top one more time? Shh. Uh, they wanna know if we need to cancel the show tonight. We have two hours. I'll let Sam know. He should be on his way. Zach is a fighter. But his body is shutting down. Could be days, or sooner. At this point, it's hard to tell. The best thing we can do for Zach right now is to make sure he's comfortable. Okay. - Thank you. - You call me if you need me. Thank you. Thank you. - It's not fair. - I know it isn't. All right, I'm gonna call Sammy 'cause she needs to go on without him. Okay. I gotta let Amy know. Okay, love. Oh, Grace. Have you gone down to see him? I can't. We don't know how much time he has left, sweetheart. - Mom, I can't. - You can. You know what? - Just you go sit with him. - Please don't make me. You don't have to say anything. You just go sit with him. It will be okay. Okay? Go on. Go on, honey. It's okay. Go on, honey. It's okay. Hey, dork. What am I gonna do without you? Watch whatever you want. I love you. Hey. Hey. He made us promise we'd still go. Thank you for staying with him. Hey. Help me with my tie? Zach. What are you... Zach, you're... You're supposed to be in bed. What are you... You're going to get your prom, Amy Adamle. Are you sure? I don't need a prom. We're going. Zach! Good luck, my man. You're gonna crush it tonight! Hurry up! This is all you. Okay, it's cold. This time it's your name in the lights. - You ready? - Yeah. - Have a great show. - Thanks so much. Kick ass, Zach. Okay. Yeah, we got Zach stage right. Hey, gimpy. - You made it. - Yeah. I made it. Right. Just don't screw it up. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Well, first of all, I'd like to welcome you to the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund Prom Party and Concert! That's right. This is the party of all parties! This beautiful and amazing occasion reminds me of a quote from the great Sadie Delany which says, "Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet." And, honestly, I don't think anything is sweeter than seeing all you guys come together for Zach. Yeah. Now, without further ado, coming to the stage is the other half of A Firm Handshake. Give it up for Sammy Brown, everybody. Sammy Brown! Wish me luck. Go get 'em. Um... Thank you, Milton. Ooh! Don't take that, Weaver! So, um, Zach's family asked me to sing a song, and this one's called, "How to Go to Confession." Wrote it for a friend. May I have this dance? - Hey. - Hey. May I have this dance? Always. Thanks, everybody. So, now I'd like to introduce you to the man of the hour, my best friend, Mr. Zach Sobiech! Yeah! Thank you. Hello, Minneapolis! Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined... this. You know I've been thinking a lot about how I'll be remembered after all this. And for a long time, I thought that I'd be remembered as a kid who went down fighting. But now, sitting here, looking at all of you... I know I'm gonna be remembered as the kid who went up fighting... and didn't really lose. Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! This is a song called "Clouds." Zach? Wanna know a little secret? Most teenagers out there feel like they're invincible. Not the Superman kind of invincible. The kind of invincible that tricks you into thinking tomorrow might be a better day to start chasing your dreams. Now, look, I know it probably seems weird for me to write a college essay when, most likely, I won't make it there. But I wasn't about to let a little thing like cancer earn me my first F. So, if by some miracle I get the chance to go to college, I will coax every ounce of experience I can out of it. But if I don't, that's okay too. Rob. Because I plan to get as far as I can with my limited time. See, we all have limited time. So, what is it I plan to do with my one wild and precious life? It's really simple, actually. I just wanna make people happy. As much as I can, for as long as I can. And in the end, I hope my story helps everyone to realize... that you don't have to find out you're dying... to start living. Oh, that went really far. Think of your enemies, Sammy. Go! - We should take a picture. - All right, let me rally the troops. Guys. Reed. Come on. Let's take a picture. - Oh, wait, let's... - Hi, um, excuse me. Could you take a picture for us? - Sure. No problem. - Thank you. All right. You guys, you go there. You go here. Our two biggest fans right here. Okay. Let's do it. All right. One, two, three. - All right. - Thank you so much. Have a good one. - Yeah, you too. - Whoa, they're hyper today. Wait, Sam, look at this. Do you see that? - What, I look bad? - No. That's a "Z," right? Yeah, that's a "Z." - We got it. - Yeah, you got it! I want everyone to know. You don't have to find out you're dying to start living.
