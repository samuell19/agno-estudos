"Sodo Station" BOKURA-WA ARUKU, TADA SOREDAKE [We'll keep walking, that's all] Hey. Whose Hiromi Kawakami book was this? That's mine, but do you want it? I'll take it if you don't want it. I lied, Miyuki, it's yours. Oh yeah? Yeah. You were in tears reading it. I forgot. Are you alright? - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Let's move some of them here. Are you alright? We'll get 10,000 yen or so? Pretty good condition, so maybe we'll get more? That's true. It better not be a few hundred yen. There's every volume of Kaiji in here. What time was the flight, Kenji? 9 o'clock, the day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow... You don't have to see me off. New York's not that far away. Here. Give me some more. I'm okay. You won't be back for a while, right? That's my plan. Besides, you can visit if you feel like it. Yeah, but... I said I'm leaving to study interior design, But it's more that I feel trapped here. Maybe I won't go to New York after all? - Let's go home? - You don't even mean it! I'm serious! It's a bad idea, right? "I abandoned my dreams for a woman," you know. It's not that, but... I'm not so sure I can handle two years without you. Okay, here. I'm good. How's 1,400 yen? What are you laughing at? 1,400 yen for all that. Exactly the cost of our ramen here. Pisses me off. You can stay in New York if you like it there. I know. But you've gotta let me know. Thanks for waiting. Thank you. Let's eat. Tell me if you find a new partner. I got it! I'll let you know, too. What's the matter? Our last meal. For now. For three years' worth of books. Look. Wish! Wish! Try it. Come on. Wish. One more time. Why should I? I wasn't looking. Keep eating. Thanks for the meal! Thank you. Hang on. Thank you for the meal. Thank you. Excuse me, thank you. Can I take a picture? You're running away. Excuse me. Hello. You live here? Yes. I used to live here. Here? My room is the one on the second floor. On the second floor? Same as me. Oh yeah? Your desk? Near the window. Me too! Are you in Tokyo now? Yeah, I am. Lucky. I'm going to Tokyo when I graduate, too. For college? I haven't decided yet. But I don't like this place, there's nothing here. It's boring. What do you do? What do you do? I'm a photographer. Oh. Like for Seventeen Magazine? Like the tabloids and stuff. That's impressive. I enjoy it. I have a dream, too. A dream? What is it? It's a secret. It's strange, isn't it? Like I'm walking with my future self. Really? You don't bike to the station. Yeah. I like to walk. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Ms. Satoko. I see your photos sometimes. Really? Those shots in that magazine are good. What's it called? "Tomorrow's Children"? That series ends next month, though. Oh. There's nothing like kids' expressions. You're doing well. For now. So, what's up? Just felt like it. Felt a little nostalgic. What? What is it? What? Something happen? Not really. No! Stop it! You visit your hometown, carrying a camera. Of course something's going on! You're too sure of yourself! My intuitions tend to be right. My students are afraid of it. I'm kidding. Just tell me when you feel like it, Miyuki. Thanks. I'll finish soon. Hold on. Those who silence their emotions They're searching for kindness Until they each find their own peace of mind Since that day I found you in the pink haze Every night I gaze at the sky searching for a shooting star It's awkward and it's unnatural but it's so strange How the distance between us shrinks Today was great. The moment you heard the notes, you know, It was obvious. Just those first notes, it set the entire mood. It was a very, very good session. So we wanna perform live sets like these, to build a fanbase. We'll keep doing stages with other bands, too. - After all, as a live band-- - Go home if you want to. ...to build our fanbase. That's why we're touring-- Hey. Just finished? Wanna eat something? It'll take a bit. Could I? Sorry. Excuse me, pardon me. Do you mind sharing the table? Want a drink? Sure. Thanks. It's four days in a row. I'm grateful. I don't mind. Are you trying too hard? With what? Are you struggling now that Kenji's gone? Not at all. That's how it looks. Are you mad? Are you mad? Nope. How much? 1,500 yen. I'll wait for you again tomorrow. - Miyuki. - What? Would you go out with me? I've liked you for a while. - Thanks for the meal. - Sure. Back tomorrow, right? - See ya. - Night. Wish he wasn't so sudden about it... Oh. You know about Yasushi, right? I know! No, I mean... - He passed away. - What? Oh. Yeah. Last year. It was a car accident. His car skidded and crashed into a wall. He was married. I heard about that. Feels like he rushed through his life, you know? What about Saki? Got married. Then divorced, and came back here. Life's unpredictable. Also, I found a boyfriend. Seriously? What? It's only been like a month since you broke up. I recover quickly. You too, Miyuki, forget about Kenji, and get a new-- I'm gonna go visit. His house? Huh? Hey! Are you sure about this? It's fine! I see. So you're Miyuki Matsunaka. Yes. Yasushi, he'd always buy the magazines that featured your photos. You moved away, right? Yes. Here on an assignment? No. I just had some free time. Oh. I thought about reaching out to you. I'm sorry. I doubt Yasushi imagined his life would end like this. I bet he's surprised, too. I haven't sorted out my feelings, either. I understand. When this child grew up, Had his own family, And headed off on his own, We were to grow old. And drink tea on the porch together. That was my dream. I guess you realized your dream. Yasushi... He used to always say, "Matsunaka's photos are so direct." That's why... I wanted to meet you. Don't worry. I know you guys dated. That you dumped him, too. But I'm glad I met you today. Hey. If you don't mind... Could I get a picture with him? Sure. Really? Please smile a bit-- oh. Don't wanna? Can you look at me? Look over there. Okay! So cute. Thank you. Will I ever find something new to dream about? Those who silence their emotions They're searching for kindness Until they each find their own peace of mind I was looking for a change but the change was within me With every moment that I spend with you baby My feelings grow strong no longer I hunger I am fulfilled my questions were answered You line the stars up you light the stars up Every breath we take another saga starts up The universe, it starts to move press play not pause You're my cause and effect I want you in my arms Since that day I found you in the pink haze Every night I gaze at the sky searching for a shooting star It's awkward and it's unnatural but it's so strange How the distance between us shrinks I want to keep holding you letting the hours tick by I should be hungry but my heart's fulfilled In love, everyone's gonna have a moment like this one At least once, right? Within our overlapping lives There's no panic button that we can press That's why we hold each other close In this bright, warm light even darkness will fade Any mountain, any valley, they can't stop our fate Any rain, any snow, they can't stop our way It's like give and take without the take babe Filled with compassion and kindness The two of us, we can free the whole world from blindness Won't that be a warm light Like the angels sing, the best team A reason to live, the best thing We can conquer anything A kindness that could embrace the whole sky A curiosity that could reach the bottom of the sea Did you see her? Let's go in. When Kenji left for New York. I felt like I was left behind. I realized I can't keep dreaming about the same thing. Three years is 1,400 yen, you know. What's that? Guess I'm still standing in one place. Who cares? Take a little break. I couldn't say anything to Kaoru. When we were in school, we all spent the same time together, And I took that for granted. We drift apart, just a little... Now time passes differently for all of us. I never would've imagined. Gonna go to New York? No way. Then forget it. You're living your own time, Miyuki. It's the same for me. I didn't think I'd teach at the school I attended. His vibration. Your cell phone. You're not going to pick up? It's okay. I feel him. No one can stop time, huh? Yeah. Hey. Wanna invite everyone for karaoke, like old times? Sounds good. I want to take photos of everyone. The rain's stopped. Matsunaka! What's up? Sorry. It'll be quick. Sure. Okay... Stand there. Here? Few steps back. Little more. A bit forward, oh-- - Here? - Ready? Just like this? Yeah, it's fine. Here we go. Okay. Hang on. You're stiff! - Stiff? - Yeah! Smile! Say cheese. One more. Okay. - Is that it? - Yeah, we're good. I'll head back. - Thanks. Sorry to bother you. - See ya. Bye! You look good in those. These? No, they're embarrassing. - Makes you a little handsome. - Yeah right. - Can I take a picture? - Go ahead. - Okay, that's fine. - Here? Okay. Ready? Just, smile, or whatever. How about a pose? - A pose? - Never mind. Oh, that's good. Like that. Thanks. Okay. Are we good? Thanks. I'm gonna go, then. Your girlfriend, are you still together? Absolutely. - 'Til next time. - See ya. Bye. - Long time no see! - Sorry! Long time. What are you up to? - Just thought I'd take some pictures. - What? - Come on. You're cute. - Look at me-- You're in luck. You're looking cute today. Then, wait-- move just a little bit closer. Just like that. Okay. Give me something more, like... - Peace sign? - Nice, that's good. Try to be-- Even cuter-- oh, that's cute! Okay! - Okay? - And one more. This is embarrassing. Without the peace sign this time. Okay. Alright, say cheese. Ayaka! - Long time no see. - Sorry, sorry. Thought I'd take a picture. Wait, stand these. Let me take one first. Back a bit more. A little more. Sorry. Oh-- Right about there. Okay. Can I take it? Yes. Yes? Why are you being so formal... Here I go. How about a smile, or something... Smile! Hey. This place... What does Ayaka think tastes the best here? The mince? Minced meat cutlet. Knew it. Sorry. Were you busy? - No, it's fine. - Sorry. It's been a while. Why so standoffish? I'm just gonna take a picture. I'll take one right now. - Just a bit closer. - Closer? Closer. One more step. Okay. Ready. You look intimidating, as usual. You're laughing. - Alright, here we go. Ready! - Okay. Give me a bigger smile, you know, or something... Show off that machismo of yours, Fuku. Show me your best. Oh, that's great! Excellent! Here we go. Okay. Okay.

Sure. Are we in position? Um, a little bit closer. Little closer? Yeah, around there. Okay. Thanks. You work together? Yeah, together. I didn't know! I'm taking the photo, like this. Go ahead. Okay? You're not a couple or anything, right? - We're actually a couple. - No way! - Actually. - Actually. - Seriously? - I'm serious. Cool, then you should flirt with each other. - What? No way. - That's gonna be hard. Thanks. I like that shyness. - Thanks. - Sure, no problem. You're so chill. - Thanks, I'm all set. - Okay. - I'll drop in next time. - Come by! See ya!

You're "Ms. Satoko". Let's form two rows. Smaller kids in front. Bigger kids in the back. And stagger yourselves. Nice, nice. - How's this? - Good. - Ready? - Um, just a little... It's like-- You're a little slanted. The left side can come forward. - Like this, right? - So the other kids can go in between. You're the teacher, look behind you and check! Make sure the kids in the back can pop their heads out. Okay. You can see them. Okay. Say cheese. Everyone ready? - Here we go. - Okay. Go. - I'm taking it! - Okay! Okay! Smile! Another one. Say cheese! Okay. - Thanks. - All set? Thanks guys, we're done. Photos are done. So... dismissed! See you in a bit. Welcome home. Oh, yeah. I found this in my room. It must be yours, isn't it? This takes me back. I shouldn't keep your memories. Thank you. Thank you. Well then... Take care, my future self. Take care, my past self. I don't like being the past. See ya. Hey! Hey, hey! Thanks. See ya! Bye! Dear classmates of Class 3-5, How are you doing? I'm doing well. While I gazed at the flowing wind For some reason it reminded me of you More than it usually does Blue afternoon sky, quietly distorting In time, it'll gently soothe this town Countless drops of rain Fall from the vast sky to strike me To envelop my weaknesses Too softly to be noticed I reached out my hands Into the brief glimmers of sunlight My palms shined slightly With the hues of summer No matter how far apart we are No matter how close we are to heartbreak While there's a smile on your face This rain will connect us No matter how lost I may be I remember your pure face And I'm still walking Beyond what binds us For ever, and ever Sakura Ando Tasuku Emoto Nahana Rikako Sakurai Masato Hyugaji Keichi Tanino Countless drops of rain Fall from the vast sky to strike me To envelop my weaknesses Too softly to be noticed Kengo Kora Tamae Ando Countless drops of rain envelop us Music by SPANK PAGE "koi" [Love] "ame ~ rain song ~" (Theme Song) Afternoon sky, softly distorting Written and Directed by Ryuichi Hiroki This work was inspired by "1/41 - A Journey to See My Classmates" by Panda Kanno.
