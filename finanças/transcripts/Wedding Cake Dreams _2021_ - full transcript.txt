Hey Carrie. And your future is filled with things as sweet as this wedding cake. Let's go play. This is boring. Norman Beiber, you're the worst. And now our flower girl, Miss Carrie Watson, would like to toast the bride and groom. Carrie, honey. Don't you want to give your speech? I can't. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Love you. Uh, change of plans everyone. I'll be giving the speech. What do you think you're doing? Save some for me. Why didn't you give your speech, Ladybug? You were so excited about it. I got Beibered. Ah. What did he do this time? I had everything ready, and then he bumped into me and my cards got all messed up. You practiced that speech 100 times. You could've done it without the cards. What if I forgot something? I wanted it to be perfect. Oh, honey. Perfection is really hard to get, and nearly impossible to keep. I missed the cake. I know what to do about that. Huh? Never attend a wedding without something to put the leftovers in. So put this under your pillow tonight and you will dream of the one. Which one? Oh, I don't know honey. Everybody's story's different. That is what the cake is for. Okay. If I put it under here, I'll meet the man of my dreams. You look beautiful. Mmm. Carrie, what's this frosting? Earth to Carrie. What's in this frosting? It's delicious. Lemon and thyme. Careful, don't want to contaminate the samples with crumbs. Hey, I'm doing my own very important research over here. Yep. That's delicious. This time I adjusted the acidity levels and used a higher gluten flour to increase the elasticity. So basically you made it more soft and lemony. Baking is chemistry. Okay. I think I have everything I need to finish running this data set while you're at your sister's wedding. I'm doing double duty as the Maid of Honor and baking Lydia's wedding cake. You're not going to stop baking once the wedding's over, are you? I've grown accustomed to this new hobby of yours. I didn't realize how much science there is in baking. I really enjoy it. Okay. You need something to distract you from this project. You've practically been sleeping at the lab. I've only done that twice. Three times. Four max. Oh? What's going on? Just Ask Josie has a new post up. Can't get into that stuff. You spend way too much time with your head stuck in a particle analyzer. Everybody reads Just Ask Josie. It's fascinating. It's just other people's love advice. Hey, it lets me think there's still hope for me. Okay, listen to this one. Sad in San Francisco. Says she's in love with her boss and wants to know if she should tell him how she feels. Why is it always women that ask questions like this? Wonder what Josie would say if it were a guy. I guess it could be a guy. I sort of just assumed. But whoever it is, Josie says that Sad in San Francisco should take their time and get to know their boss outside of work first, because people can be different in their personal and professional lives. She says if it's meant to be, it will happen. But if not, Sad in San Francisco could risk their career aspirations over a relationship that fizzles out after the first date. Well, at least she gives good advice. Josie is never wrong. You should follow her. What are you doing? Just for the entertainment value. You and Griffin are the perfect couple. Were the perfect couple. What happened? Griffin said that he felt like everything was all mapped out with us and he needed to feel more spontaneous. You two were my dream team. Looks like you're going to have to pin your hopes on another star. You know what? His loss. Because you are amazing, and your dream guy is out there just waiting for you to walk into his life. It would have to be the literal man of my dreams. I am so not interested in chasing love. Ah! Crumbs. Best Man reporting for duty. I got my suit, I got my dancing shoes, and I promise you're going to cry when I give my toast. Buckets. Tell your bride to keep some tissues on hand. All right. See you soon, buddy. Honey, I'm home! You're here! Dad, Carrie's here. Hi Carrie, I'll be right there. I have a million things to tell you. There's like 20 pounds of Jordan almonds in the kitchen that we have to bag for the wedding favors, and Dad ordered the monogrammed napkins for the reception even though I told him those are so 1985. I can hear you, Lydia. And I can't decide if I want to wear red shoes with my dress, or blue shoes for my "something blue." And I'm getting married in like four days, and I'm so happy you're here. Did you have a good flight? It was great. Oh. That must be Brad and Jason. Brad and Jason are here! - Hi. - Hi. Carrie, you have to meet Brad's best man, Jason. Are you okay? Lift up your arms. No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I'm, I'm, I'm fine. She needs some air. Brad, can you open up a window? Yeah, uh-huh. No, no, I'm good. I just, I need something... something to drink. Let me grab you some water. Oh no, wait, wait! I'm the one who should be moving around. Get the blood... flowing. I'll, I'll get it myself. You know, it's not real because I'm just imagining things. I'll go with her. You two will meet for real at the BBQ. - Love you. - Love you too. Over here. Okay, so... Coughing fit aside, what, what'd you think? About what? About Carrie. I don't know. We barely made eye contact. Lydia's been dying for you two to meet. Do I sense a conspiracy here? No, no, there's no conspiracy. We just think you two would hit it off. Relationships that start at weddings rarely make it past the reception. I've heard that before. Lydia read that to me. It's, it's from that website Just Ask Josie. She's obsessed. She loves it. You read that too? Who doesn't? Hey, don't we have to pick up your cousin from the airport? This is why I made you the best man. You never did drink enough water. You'd come home from soccer practice totally red in the face and I'd ask you "where was your water bottle?" And you hadn't even put it in your bag. I promise I didn't play any soccer before my flight, Dad. Well, you really need to take care of yourself, Carrie. We've got so much to do before the wedding. Oh gosh, maybe I should be drinking more water too. She's perfectly fine, just give her a few seconds to get her bearings. Thank you, Mom. Oh, the BBQ guy's here. I hope he remembered that extra tray of potato salad. We always run out of potato salad. Oh wow, you were thirsty. Do you want some more? Mom? Yes, Ladybug? Do you remember that thing about sticking a piece of wedding cake under your pillow? Put it under your pillow and you'll dream of your future love. Yeah. That one. What about it? Um... Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you remember, and you do, so that's good. I'm going to go unpack, okay? Okay. Do you need some help? Nope. I'm good. Thanks for the lemonade. Are you sure you're all right? Right as rain. Hm. Okay. Get it together Carrie. You are seeing things. It was just a dream. But he looked just like him. I mean, just like him. Except three dimensional, and with dimples. No. This is nuts, Carrie. You need help. And you need to stop talking to yourself. I'm certainly not going to talk to anyone else about this. This is silly, right? I'm not going to bare myself to a stranger. But I have to tell someone. Maybe I can tell Lydia. No, she'll tell Dad and then he'll get all excited and try and play matchmaker. Or he'll think I've totally lost my mind. It's fine. She probably gets thousands of messages every day. I bet she won't even see mine. Dear Josie, you won't believe what happened today... I literally met the man of my dreams. Carrie. Come. Are you feeling better? Mom said you decided to take a nap. Much better. Well come on, sit down. You have to help me with this plate. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. We were just telling Jason about your work. Oh, I'm sure Jason doesn't want to hear about analytical chemistry. No, it's interesting. Do you get to put things in beakers and make them explode? Well, I've only had a couple of explosions, but it's mostly a lot of data manipulation. Developing new analytical methods, comparing variable ranges, looking at linearity and reproducibility. Yeah, it's, it's really cool. - Oh! - Whoa, there buckaroo. I am so clumsy sometimes. It's all good. Oh. Sorry, I gotta take this. I'm going to go get more potato salad. Does anyone want anything? I'm good. - Good? - I'm good. What is going on with you? Uh, wedding jitters? Isn't that my job? They're sympathy jitters. I read about it somewhere. Did you read about it on Just Ask Josie? The one where the Maid of Honor is worried that she's falling for the groom, but Josie tells her it's just this weird symbiotic thing that happens with bridesmaids and brides. You're into Just Ask Josie? I love it. Don't you? Girls, look who I found. Do you remember little Norman Beiber? Not so little anymore. So glad you could make it. You and Norman were such good friends when you were young. I haven't seen you since high school, Carrie. The years have really been kind to you. Thanks. Norman has made quite a success for himself. He just opened up his second car dealership. And he just bought the house at the end of the cul-de-sac. You know, where the Connors used to live. Huh, that's really something. Yeah, you know, I'd love to take you down there and show you how I fixed up the old place. Oh, I'm just so busy with the wedding. A Maid of Honor's work is never done. Ah, right. Norman! Just the fellow I'm looking for. I'm thinking of replacing my old sedan. Oh! So we thinking about going sporty or more full luxury? Uh, talk to me about hybrids. Hybrids. Okay. Interesting, interesting... Hmm. I got this. Come on, Carrie. Let's see it. Oh, gotta go, see ya. Oop! Hey. Oh, oh here. Cornhole, go ahead! Oh. You first. Okay. I'm afraid this seat is taken. Oh, it's you! Yep. It's me. What are the chances, right? Stars are spectacular tonight. Yeah, they are. Bet you got the best seat in the house. There's room if you'd like to join me. Okay. My mom calls this her stargazing bench. My dad got it for her, whichever anniversary is what, I don't remember. But they still sit out here every night and look at the stars together. That's a dream, right? Dream? What dream? I never dream. I sleep like a rock. No, I mean like of the future. Finding that person you want to share a bench with forever. Lydia: Carrie, are you back here? Hi. You two look so cute cuddled up. Smile for a pic. Oh, I uh... - That's cute. - That's nice. Maid of honor, reporting for duty. Do you need anything from me? Mom wants to know if we think she needs more lights out back for the reception. Oh, lighting is so important for setting the mood, so... Okay. What was that thing you said about not starting a relationship at a wedding? There's an exception for every rule. Sure buddy. Whatever you say. Dear Josie. I've never written to someone like you before. This is going to sound bizarre, but I don't know who else to ask. When I was 10 years old, I went to my favorite cousin's wedding. Afterwards, my mom gave me a piece of wedding cake and told me to sleep with it under my pillow, and I would dream of my future love. It's been years since I thought about that face. Until today, when I literally met the man of my dreams. He's definitely for real this time and I don't know what to do. Signed, Wedding Cake Dreams. Dear Wedding Cake Dreams... - Wake up! - Hmm? I need to hem your dress. Do I smell blueberry muffins? Yes. And I'm not saving you one if you don't hurry. Dear Wedding Cake Dreams. It might feel like you already have a connection to this guy. But dreams aren't real life. Give your dream dude a chance. Don't let yourself get swept away. I don't think you're crazy at all. We've all had vivid dreams that we can't forget. But my advice is to proceed with caution. Sincerely, Josie. Better be careful, Lydia. She's going to outshine the bride in that dress. That's impossible. Doesn't matter anyway. The person I care about impressing only has eyes for me. We need to find a Brad for Carrie. Then I'll be a happy dad. I'm working on it. How about everyone take a break from matchmaking till the wedding's over? Got the jars for the centerpieces. We gotta stop meeting like this. Hello again. I think we might be past the point of handshakes. I'll remember that for next time. Well, what do you think, Jason? On the shoulder, or off? I think she's beautiful both ways. Thank you. Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go change. My sister. Dear Josie. How do I proceed with caution if I have to be around my dream guy all the time? There's no way for us to avoid each other, and there's another problem. He's literally dreamy. I'm not really attracted to someone until I get to know them. But I feel like I've known him since I was 10. "How can this be real? I need advice ASAP." Brad: You look great. Dear Wedding Cake Dreams. When you're together, try to emphasize... I know I'm not having the best hair day, but is it really that scary? What? You look amazing. Did you give your dress back to Lydia? She still needs to hem it. Oh boy! - Do we need any Band- - Aids? Try to emphasize the fact that the two of you are just friends for now. Hopefully he'll get the hint and you can slow things down. We're just friends. I can be a friend. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. This is pretty simple. You just want to take a jar, wrap some twine around the top to make it look pretty, put in some sea glass in the bottom, insert a candle, and voila. Costal beachy elegance. Hey everyone, sorry I'm late. I had to finish up some work. I missed the instructions. Oh, you just take one of these and then wrap it around the top like this. Thanks. Can I get a bump? Teamwork makes the dream work, buddy. I'm not well known for my crafting. I once hot glued my hand to a Christmas wreath. That's hilarious. I love learning new things about my friends. So your dad was saying that you and Lydia collected all this sea glass? Oh yeah, bags of it. Drove Mom and Dad crazy but they never got rid of it. Oh, Judy and I used to love to take the girls down to the beach. Do you remember what all the colors mean? I think so. Oh, another jar down. I'll get a broom. So what do they mean? Well, the white means happiness, and it's the easiest one to find. Mom always said we should remember that in life too, that happiness is everywhere if you're willing to look. That's good advice. The green is for energy. What about the brown? Intelligence. One time in 5th grade, my teacher thought I was cheating on a test because I kept reaching into my desk for something. But I had just brought a little bag of brown sea glass and kept touching it to try and get smarter. Did you get an A? I did. Nice. Now, the blue is the rarest. So if you find a piece you should hold onto it like a treasure. What does it mean? The blue glass means love. Or it could just mean friendship. Just friends. I get the colors mixed up all the time. Oh, hey Carrie! Hi guys. Hi. So we got this smoking hot new convertible down at the lot. I brought it by because I thought you might want to take a ride. Um... sure. How about now? Ah, yes! Let's go burn some rubber. I gotta go, sorry. I got a need for speed. I'll see you later... pal. Wow. You're going to have to take your shoes off before we get in the car. Really? Yeah, I don't want to mess up the floor mats. Okay. Thanks. You ready? Yeah. - Ahhhhh! - Hang on! Okay! Brad: Look at this, beautiful. Sure is. Sorry guys, I think I'm going to bow out and try to get some work done. Yeah. See you later. Don't work too hard. What is it that Jason does again? He's a web designer. Hmm. Yeah. Thanks, Norman. Yeah, well, a gentleman always walks a lady to the door. Oh, that's really not necessary. Don't be silly. I uh... I got it if I just... Uh... Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Okay. So here we are at the door. Looks like your job is done. You remember when we were just little monsters? Yeah. Spent all summer running around this neighborhood. You know, I know you think I didn't notice, but I always knew you had a crush on me. Oh, I did? I guess some things never change, huh? Hey kids! Mom! Norman wants to take you for a test drive in his new convertible. Really? Oh, I love convertibles. Mm-hmm. It's a precision piece of machinery, but you might want to put the top up. Well, there is no time like the present. Let's go! I guess I'll see you later. Have fun. Dear Josie. I tried the friend thing, and I know you said "don't get swept up" but you haven't looked in his eyes. I think I really like him. Can I trust my feelings? Thanks, Wedding Cake Dreams. Oh, hey man. I just came by to drop off the ring. Great. I'm just going to grab another water. You want anything? - No, I'm good. - Yeah. Oh, Jason. You're as bad as Lydia. What does Just Ask Josie have to say today? Admin Mode, here's what Josie is thinking. What? What are you doing? Why are you getting messages for Just Ask Josie? What? Oh, uh... I design her website. Oh, no way! Lydia's going to freak when I tell her this. You can't tell her. Why not? Do you post all of her messages? In a way. So how does this work? Does she call you and then you type them up? No, she doesn't have to call me. How does it work? She... is... me. You're... Just Ask Josie. Okay, let me get this straight. Um, you are Josie. You're the one giving the advice? I know this is a lot of information to process right now... How did I not know that my best friend in the world is the most famous love expert? But you can't tell anybody. Why not? This is awesome! Do I look like a Josie to you? No, but who cares? My followers do. If I am not who I saw I am, how are they going to trust me? Then why are you pretending to be a girl, hmm? Okay, remember when we were in college and I was a resident advisor? Yeah. Well, the students kept coming to me and they'd be all upset and say that they were having relationship problems. But then they were too embarrassed to tell me what those problems were. So I created a website called Just Ask Josie and I started handing out fliers. I know, it's a completely stupid stereotype. But back then I didn't think anybody would want love advice from a guy. You told me to break up with that girl Mikayla when I thought she was cheating on me on spring break. You're welcome. She was cheating on you. I can't believe that was you! And then the site took off, it started getting bigger, and then it turned into this whole social media thing and now I am Just Ask Josie, world-renowned relationship expert. Okay, you, you have to let me tell Lydia. No! If this gets out, Just Ask Josie is over. Oof. Oh yeah, um... It's, it's starting to happen. What's starting to happen? Anytime I try to keep a secret I, I break out in hives. If Lydia sees this, she's going to know I'm not telling her something. Okay, we can't let her see it. Can you, can you fan that? Oooh, ahhh, oh! Why did anyone let me wear this? Dear Wedding Cake Dreams. If you're still unsure of your feelings, why don't you try asking your dream guy to some kind of group activity? It will give you a chance to get to know each other better, but the pressure will be off to be romantic. - Hey. - Hey. We still need to do a cake tasting. I thought I'd just leave that up to you. Don't you want to be personally invested in your wedding's flavor profile? A wedding needs a flavor profile? Absolutely. I'm so glad you're here. They don't put any of this kind of stuff into bridal magazines. Great. So it'll just be you and Brad. And I thought maybe you might want to invite Jason... Just in case you and Brad disagree and need a tiebreaker. Okay. Sure. It'll just be a fun group thing. Ugh. Can you turn the fan on? It's kind of hot in here, right? I need you to stay with me, Brad. Nothing has changed. Except now I know! You can do this. I can maybe keep my mouth shut, but what am I supposed to do about this? You're up awfully late. You too. Just working on the ceremony. I'm so honored that Lydia asked me to be the officiant. I can't think of anyone better for the job. I thought about getting a staff and a robe, but your dad said that it was a tad too much. Maybe. I'm getting ready for Lydia's cake tasting. What are the choices? We have chai cake with clover honey mascarpone, lemon thyme with strawberry mousse, and Mexican chocolate with coffee whipped cream. Why do young people have to fiddle with the classics? Just give me French vanilla cake with strawberries and buttercream frosting. A marriage can stand on vanilla cake and buttercream. Maybe I'll add that to the mix. I consider myself more of an improvisational baker. I don't measure anything, I just toss in a little bit of this, a little bit of that. You never know what's going to come out of the oven. Baking is like science. If you follow the rules, you can predict your outcome. Oh, I have had some spectacular fails. But sometimes I would end up with the most delightful surprises. So I should throw out all my measuring spoons? I'm not saying that. Just saying trust your own instincts once in a while. Huh. ♪ Oh, Carrie. They're almost too pretty to eat. Thank you. But I will anyway. Hi Brad! Hi Jason. Why are you wearing that sweater, silly? Oh, I've got a chill. Oh no, are you getting sick? No, no, he's not getting sick. I'm a little chilly too. Don't you feel it? Well, why don't we get started? Nothing warms you up better than cake. We have four to try. I was thinking that we could talk about our likes and dislikes, get to know each other better, and then you could tell me... I can't tell you anything. About cakes, because Brad, he can't cook. No. You're so fidgety. Well, this one is Mexican chocolate with coffee whipped cream. Have you ever been to Mexico? I love travel, how about you? What? Um, nothing. What do you think of the cake? It's great. You need a glass of water, Brad? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, could be great, a glass of water would be really good. I'll get you one, babe. Well maybe we could move on to the next cake. We have lemon thyme with a strawberry mousse. I tweaked the recipe a little bit from the original, so I know I can depend on it to turn out perfectly. Dependability is important, wouldn't you say? Well, if you don't like that one, I have a chai cake with clover honey mascarpone. Yeah, the chai has a spiciness at the end that's a real nice surprise. Are you the type of person who likes surprises? Hmm, hmm... What do you think, Brad? Um, I... I can't decide. You, you choose okay? I love you. Bye. O-kay. That chai cake... Really good stuff. Do you think he's okay? Yeah, don't worry about it. Hmm. I guess. Well, there's still one more to try? Would you be sad if I said I just wanted strawberries with vanilla and buttercream? Not at all. A marriage can stand on vanilla cake with buttercream. Okay. It's not going to work. You're doing great. Just let me tell Lydia. I'll swear her to secrecy. If you tell Lydia, she might tell her sister. And then who knows who Carrie will tell, and then everything blows up in our faces. Just try not to think about it. Would you be able to not think about it? The bachelor bachelorette party is this afternoon. It will be the perfect distraction. You'll see. It's so itchy. You're going to be fine. Carrie! Hey honey. Hi. I invited Norman to the party. He said he's really looking forward to spending some more time with you. You know, Dad... Norman's always been a bit... much for my taste. Ah, Norman's just an onion. You have to peel a few layers to get to the good part. So you want me to date an onion? All I ever want is for you and your sister to be happy. And have grandchildren. Dear Josie. I tried a group date. It was awkward to say the least. Maybe my dream guy just isn't interested. Should I just move on? Feeling confused, Wedding Cake Dreams. Dear Wedding Cake Dreams. If you really like this guy, I don't think there is anything wrong with just letting him know. But if that makes you too nervous, just play it super cool. And it'll force him to make the first move. It's risky but it could be worth it. Hey! Oh, my gosh. I haven't seen you guys in forever. Hey. Sorry we had to duck out so fast earlier. Oh, it's no big deal. What did you guys end up picking? Vanilla with strawberries. Ooh, that is always a winner. Yeah. I like vanilla. Do you come up with the recipes? I'm imagining you in your lab with like, gloves and goggles like a mad scientist just coming up with flavors. I guess it's kind of like that, but without the goggles. The worst that could happen is I get frosting in my eye, and that's kind of a delicious problem, right? Yeah. Hey, are you thirsty? Uh... Oh, no-, you know, I'm good. Yeah. Well, it was nice talking to you. Oh yeah, you too. Welcome, to all my favorite people. I wanted today to be fun and different, just like me. And so, we're not going to do your usual bachelor bachelorette pub crawl. Today we're going to do a wedding scavenger hunt. Each team will get a list of clues, and the first team to make it back to the finish line with a picture of everything on the list wins. So everybody get into teams of two. Go. Go talk to her. Hey. What do you say we make a dream team? Oh, yeah, I was just... Sorry man, we're already paired up. Oh. That's a shame. I guess I'll see you at the finish line. Hey. What do you say we make a dream team? Thanks. I didn't want you to get Beibered. How did you know about that? Lydia told me and Brad about it. She told you, so then you are in on the... I'll get a camera. Okay. So much for playing it cool. Lydia: On your marks... get set... Go! Woah. We're really doing this. Okay! Where are we going? The first clue says deep friendship and young love doth fill the only place where time stands still. Okay. I still don't know where we're going. It's a play on words. Time and thyme, like the herb. My dad's herb garden. It's the only place where thyme stands still. You figured that out so fast. Well, it won't matter how fast I figured it out if we don't get moving. Right. Sorry, Care Bear. I guess you didn't make it in time. Let's go. Hurry, take a picture. Head up the street, and once do you, you'll need something old, and something new, something borrowed, and something blue. Come on, no time to waste! You really want to win this, don't you? Losing's for losers. All right then, let's do this! - There you are. - Hi! I've been looking everywhere for you. I'm right here. You missed the start of the scavenger hunt. Yeah. And why are you suddenly so obsessed with wearing turtleneck sweaters? You know, I just really didn't want these leftover cupcakes to go to waste. Mmm. I thought you didn't care about the cake. I do. You're acting really weird. Is something wrong? No, no, no, no. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm great. I'm great. I love you. And, um, I'm going to go change for tonight. ♪ Thanks. Wait, could this count as something blue? That would be cheating. Who are you afraid of, the scavenger hunt police? The only thing standing between us and anarchy is the rules. Do you want anarchy? Absolutely not. Okay then. - Thank you. - Thank you. ♪ Oh perfect. Can I get some of those please? Of course. Okay. Okay, what's next? Aren't we going to eat some? We're losing time. Do you know how many antioxidants are in these things? Yeah, lots. That could give us the edge we need to win. You're so weird. Here. Open up. You have to actually chew. Chew, right. I guess now you expect me to feed them to you every time? We should hurry if we want to finish in first place. Excuse me, miss. Oh yeah, I got it. ♪ Thank you. Dear Josie. I think he just made the first move. What now? Wedding Cake Dreams. Dear Wedding Cake Dreams. It looks like it's your turn to step up to the plate. ♪ Okay, looks like we only have one clue left. Should we take a look? Yeah. We're headed to the last clue. Mmm. I love the smell of victory. Huh? I will not get Beibered. Come on, we have to go back to the house. They're in the wrong place. We can still win this. Sure can. This is it. The winners can shout hurray when they find the most important clue of the day. The place where one story ends, but also where it begins. Why here? This is where Lydia and Brad end their single lives and start their life together as a married couple. One story ends and another begins. Say cheese. Should we hand our pictures in? Hang on a minute. ♪ My parents got married under this trellis. So did my grandparents. And now it's Lydia's turn. I guess I always thought I'd be first because I'm the older sister, but it's completely silly, because love just finds you when it does. Don't you think? Yeah. And sometimes when you least expect it. Oh, no! God, they got there first! Come on, let's go. Come on, Ladybug! Alright. Please tell me we're first! Please say we are. I think I left a lung on Main Street. Photos please. She's got them. Hmm. We have our winners. Congratulations! Nice job. Yeah, yeah. Nice job. ♪ Sometimes I wish I could just fly away ♪ ♪ Off to Jamaica or some places like that ♪ ♪ Where they're making dub tracks ♪ ♪ And the order of the day ♪ ♪ Is tonic, lime and Tanqueray ♪ Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. - Um, I'll be right back. - Yeah. Come on. ♪ What's up? Have you noticed anything weird about Brad? What do you mean? Like how he ran out of the cake tasting and he only wears turtleneck sweaters for some reason, and he keeps scratching his neck when he thinks I'm not looking. Maybe he has a bug bite. But he keeps avoiding me. I'm sure he's not avoiding you. Every single time Brad tries to keep a secret from me, he breaks out in hives. Should've seen him when he was trying to plan our engagement. He looked like a lobster with chicken pox. He's probably just nervous. Do you think he's getting cold feet? Absolutely not. Lydia, you two are written in the stars. You're good, okay? You're good. I love you so much. What would I do without you? Well, thank goodness you'll never have to find out. Oh, wait. Dad said we need more pigs in a blanket. I will see you on the dance floor, if Jason can spare you. What are you talking about? You're a wonderful sister, but a terrible liar. ♪ Seriously, it's all over me. ♪ Woo, it's chilly. I forgot how cold it is by the water. Glad you're enjoying the night, mom. Oh, nights like these are made for dancing and romance. Oh mom, I don't want to know. I'm not talking about me. So why don't you and that handsome best man leave the party and go watch some lightning bugs? Mom! What? They're fascinating insects. Sorry, I gotta take this. It's work. Don't mind me. I'm just lost in the music. Hello? Sorry to call you so late. Before you ask, everything's fine. Oh, good. I was worried. I just called to let you know that I overnighted Lydia's cake topper. For some reason they sent it here instead of your parents' house, but you should see it first thing in the morning. Thanks. I'll keep a lookout for it. So how's everything going? Really... well, actually. I'm hearing some subtext. Care to elaborate? No, not yet. I don't want to jinx it. Fine. I guess I'll have to get all my love stories from Just Ask Josie. Speaking of which, have you been following the Wedding Cake Dreams story? Uh, no, not really. I haven't been paying attention. It is everything. So this woman puts a piece of wedding cake under her pillow one night and literally dreams up this man. And then years later, she meets him in the flesh. The same guy from her dream. And now it's all "will they or won't they?" Nobody knows, but everybody wants them to. Well, what do you think about it? That whole thing sounds crazy. Crazy romantic. If they don't get together, there's something wrong with the universe. You really think so? Yeah. The world needs more fairy tales. Kaia. Yes, I packed the cake topper with extra bubble wrap. No, I have a confession to make. I know about your stash of candy bars behind the nitrogen evaporator. No, listen to me. I'm Wedding Cake Dreams. You're what?! I'm Wedding Cake Dreams. I've been writing to Just Ask Josie. The cake, the dream, the guy, everything. He's here at Lydia's wedding. He's the best man for Pete's sake. Carrie, you're famous. Shh, I don't want everyone at the lab to know. It's fine. I'm here by myself. So, I gotta know. What? Will they or won't they? She would, but will he? Come on, Carrie. Just go for it. Josie is never wrong. You do what's best for you, but whatever it is, I want details. Okay. I gotta go. Okay. Bye. ♪ Shall we? ♪ Thankful to be sitting ♪ ♪ For I could feel something settling ♪ ♪ In the middle of me ♪ ♪ My knees weak ♪ ♪ You're the person I always ♪ ♪ Hoped I'd meet ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ I really had fun tonight. Me too. It's so nice and quiet. I feel like we've been going light speed since I got here. Well, don't get too comfortable. It's just the eye of the storm. Tomorrow we have the rehearsal, the rehearsal luncheon, and then the main event. I'm going to be up all night baking the cake. You're a sweet sister for doing that. I'm honored she asked me. She could've ordered a big fancy cake from anywhere. Have you ever heard that thing about sticking a piece of wedding cake under your pillow and dreaming of your future mate? Where'd you hear that? Just read about it somewhere. Nope. Don't know anything about pillows or wedding cake. That sounds like a mess to me. Who thinks of this stuff, anyway? But you know, I should go. Lots to do. Uh, can I help with anything? No. It's a one-woman job. But, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. I'll be the one on the other side of the aisle. Good night. Good night. You calling it a night? Hardly. I have cakes to bake. It's nice to have you bumping around again. Oh sorry, I'll try not to make too much noise. No, no, no. I mean it. I like it. It reminds me of when you were in high school and you'd stay up all night studying for some big test, drinking your body weight in cocoa. Back when I still had all my little birdies in the nest. Dad? Mm-hmm? How did you know Mom was the one? Honestly, I didn't. But some things are worth taking a chance on. I love you. I love you too, Ladybug.

I know Brad is keeping something from me. There's just a lot happening right now. His parents are coming tomorrow, and you know how his mom is. She has opinions about her opinions. He won't even talk to me. Maybe he just doesn't want to put anything else on your plate. What if he doesn't want to get married anymore? Lydia. Don't think like that. Can't help it. You know how you told me you're into Just Ask Josie? Duh. She's everything. Why don't we ask her what to do? They say she's never wrong. Do you really think she'll have an answer? What do we have to lose? We'll ask Josie, and then just try not to think about it for a while. You need some sleep. Will you stay with me? Just like old times. Dear Josie. My fiancé has started acting strangely. He's avoiding me and acting nervous all the time. I think he may be having second thoughts. He hasn't told me anything, but I just have this nagging fear. Am I overreacting? Is this just normal wedding jitters? Thanks. The Angsty Bride. ♪ Oh, this is not how I like to wake up. Just... I need to see if Just Ask Josie answered us. She did. It's right here. Okay, um... Hold my hand. I'm right here. Dear Angsty Bride. There's a million reasons why someone might be nervous before a wedding, and most of them have nothing to do with not getting married. See, it's totally normal. That being said, if you really think your groom is getting cold feet, you've got to talk to him as soon as possible. You just gotta be brave. It's better to know now than to end up married to someone who isn't ready to commit. What if he says he doesn't love me anymore? Then you and I will run away on your honeymoon, and you'll find an impossibly gorgeous man on the beaches of Ibiza and we'll post a ton of pictures and make him regret everything. But that's only plan B, because that definitely won't happen. I hope you're right. Okay, come on. We've gotta start the day and get some breakfast in you. ♪ The mother of the bride shouldn't have to do that kind of work. Oh, I don't mind. I'm skimming the profits. Here. Rain check, Carrie. I've got to go find Brad. I'll have a stomach ache until I talk to him. I get it. You're brave, strong and amazing. That is your mantra. I'm brave, strong and amazing, and hopefully getting married tomorrow. You are. Was it like this when you and Dad got married? Yeah, pretty much. We just had family here at the house, and then we had a nice dinner. But we didn't care too much for a party. We just wanted to get to the honeymoon. Mom! Speaking of which, did you hunt down those lightning bugs last night? No, afraid not. Well, what's the hold up? When Griffin broke up with me... Oh honey, that's just spilled milk. No need to cry over him. No, it's not that. I was just certain he was the one. We were on the right track, everything made total sense, and then poof. He tells me he's not happy. He hasn't been for a while, and that's that. We're done. It was like I was watching a movie of a breakup in slow motion. I could watch it, but I couldn't do anything about it. I felt so foolish, because I didn't see it coming. I was picking out rings, and he was planning a future without me. You weren't a fool. You are an optimist. But I felt like a fool. And I don't want that again. You have a long, boring life ahead of you if you're done taking chances already. Sometimes I don't like it when you're right. Just tell Jason that you're into him, and then worry about what he thinks after. And in the meantime, help me finish these, or else I'm going to need a stretchier dress for tomorrow. Okay. Hey. Here. So did you talk to Brad? I've been trying, but he had to pick up his parents from the airport, and then he said he had to get his suit. We've only texted all day. Well, at least you know he has to show up for this. Here's hoping. Brad's here. What is he wearing? Look at that. Oh, beautiful. I'm going to do it. Right now. I can't wait anymore. - Hi. - Brad, I need to talk... All right wedding team, it's time to begin. Lydia and bridesmaids line up in the front. Groomsmen, find your positions. I, I gotta go. Sorry. This is impossible. Just get through the rehearsal. Okay, okay. You'll have time to talk to him after. Lydia. And the wedding march begins. The guests will all rise, and now the bride. And begin, slowly and gracefully. I'll hand you off to Brad. And I will direct you to say your vows. Brad first. Lydia, I... Not today. Save it for tomorrow. And you will, and you will, and I will say "now you may kiss the bride." Not until tomorrow, young lady. It's bad luck. Music please. We all file out, Brad and Lydia first. I need to talk to you about something. Yeah. I need to talk to you about something. Um... It just, uh... One second. It's groom stuff. Hey, hey, come on, come on. See? All right, that's enough. We're going to get to the bottom of this. You're doing fine, the rehearsal was great. No, this is not fine. I never meant for anyone to find out that I'm Just Ask Josie. And the circle's increased 100 percent in the last 48 hours. This column is everything I've been working for. And all those people who took Josie's advice trust me. And if that trust is broken, what's left? Maybe they'll trust you even more when they realize that you're not perfect. That you're not afraid of telling the truth. You don't understand. I want to, man. I really do. But I cannot wear a turtleneck at my own wedding. No more secrets. I knew it. I know you don't want to get married tomorrow, so please just get it over with and tell me the truth before we lie in front of the most important people in my life tomorrow. No, of course I want to get married. I love you. If you love me, then why are you keeping secrets from me? Brad's not keeping secrets. I am. Don't cover for him. I'm not. Brad found out something, and I made him promise not to tell you. And that's why he's got this. He's not a bad fiancé. He's being a really good friend. Fine. What's the secret? You know Just Ask Josie? How did you find out about that? What do you mean? I wrote to Just Ask Josie about Brad acting weird. Well that is incredibly ironic, because I am Just Ask Josie. What? I thought you were a web designer. I just tell everyone that to throw them off. How is this even possible? You're a guy. It's easy to be anonymous online. I think that's why people aren't afraid to tell me their stories. All right, Brad. Tell us what's really going on. There's absolutely no way this is happening. I'm not making this up. No, he's telling the truth. I might be really mad if I wasn't so... unbelievably crazy happy right now. I can't believe Just Ask Josie's our best man. Okay, okay. But to everyone else, your best man is just Jason. You guys will keep my secret, right? Yeah. Of course. We just won't ever keep any secrets from each other again, right? I promise. All right. Let's go to the rehearsal lunch. I'm famished. Thanks, man. I love you so much. Let's go get married. Lydia: I love you, babe. Let's do this. I know this is crazy. How can you do that? Just pretend you're someone you're not? It's not like that. I really care about the people that write to me. But you made a fool out of those people. You made a fool out of me. How did I make a fool out of you? Carrie! Carrie, there you are. Come on and get some dinner. I'm not hungry. Oh, Ladybug, what's wrong? I'm a moron. Why don't you let me be the judge of that? Spill it. Remember when I was 10, and you told me to put a piece of wedding cake under my pillow and I would dream of my future love? Ah, that's why you're asking about the old wives' tale. Yeah, I remember. Keep going. Well, it worked. I dreamt I was walking down the aisle, and there was a handsome groom waiting for me, and it was magical and beautiful. And then I woke up and the years passed by, and I forgot all about it. Okay? Until a couple of days ago when I met the guy from my dream. Oh my! And that guy is Jason. Double oh my. But I totally freaked out and I didn't know what to do, and so I asked this online love person, Just Ask Josie. Oh, I love her. But it turns out, hang onto your knickers, Josie is a he, not a she. Okay, bring on the big finish? And that he is Jason. That doesn't just happen to people. So not only is Jason the guy I dreamt I was going to marry, but he's also the person I already told all this to. Oh. But he doesn't know that yet. And if I tell him, then I'm afraid that he's going to think I'm crazy. But if I don't, then I'm just as much of a liar as I accused him of being. Oh, that's a real whopper. Also, you can't talk to anyone about this because if people find out, it's going to ruin his whole career or something. So sorry, but welcome to the venerable league of secret keepers. Well, secret keepers still have to eat. ♪ Mmm ♪ Come on. Yeah, let's go. ♪ The whole doesn't add up to its parts ♪ ♪ There's a hairline fracture... ♪ You know, when I was a little girl, my grandma gave me a piece of wedding cake to put under my pillow. And guess who I dreamt of. Who? Your dad. He was three years older than me, and he was the most popular boy in the school. And I was just this scrawny little freshman. You never told me this. Well, the very next day, I marched straight up to your dad standing at the locker, and I told him that I had a wedding cake dream about him, and that wedding cake dreams stick, and that we were going to get married someday, so he'd better remember my name. What did he do? He shook my hand, and then he and his friends had a good laugh and I walked away. But you ended up together. It took your dad four years to ask me out on a date. When he did, man, that first kiss stopped traffic. That's an amazing story. Love is amazing, Ladybug. You want to know something? What? That wedding cake didn't get us together, and it didn't keep us together either. But I sure am glad that it made me brave enough to make a fool of myself. Now come on. I know you're starving. No, you go ahead. I'm not ready to talk to Jason yet. Okay. - Drive safe, take care. - See you tomorrow. Bye. Hey guys. Hey. I'm really sorry about everything. I'm too in love to be angry, and we're having the best wedding ever tomorrow. Yeah. Did you talk to Carrie? No, she kept disappearing. Give her some time. She'll come around. I'm going to turn in. I'll see you in the morning? - See you bright and early. - Alright. I think he might be starting to fall for her. I love how you're just catching on. Okay, okay. It's my wedding day! Hmm. It's my... Oh, Carrie! It's glorious! Just you wait. It's not finished yet. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. You're the best sister in the world! Woah, okay! Be careful. We need it to last till the wedding. Are you okay? I just have a lot to think about. About Jason? About everything. But today is your day. Don't you have a hair appointment soon? Oh, my gosh! I have to go get ready. I love it. It's beautiful. I'm getting married! You look beautiful. You both do. Stop it. You're going to make me cry. I haven't really said anything yet. I know, but I can imagine it, and it's so nice. Carrie? I'm right here. Do you have tissues? Got 'em. It's almost time. My gorgeous girls. Here, mom. Thank you. Oh. That's my cue. Yeah.

I'm just dying to know what happened with the dream guy. Nothing yet. Oh, you're too slow. I'm going nuts over here. But did you hear about Just Ask Josie? Did I hear what about her? It's not a her. It's a him. What? He posted this whole confession last night. He said that if he wants his followers to trust him, he can't keep his identity a secret any longer. He's changing the website to Just Ask Jason. There's a picture of him up there. He's pretty hot. Hold on a second. Kaia, I've got to go. Okay. Call me later, and please have something good to tell me. Okay. Most of you have been with me for a long time, and I'm sure all of this comes as a shock. I'm sorry I kept the truth from you for so long. I thought it made it easier for people to tell their stories to a stranger, but then I remembered that the reason people come to Just Ask Josie is to make deeper connections, and the only way you can do that is by being open and vulnerable. I may lose some followers, I may have to start over, but you've all shared so much with me over the years, and now I am ready to start sharing with you too. If everyone will please bring your attention to the front? Mr. And Mrs. Brad and Lydia Sisco will cut the cake. Both: One, two, three... I was afraid you were going to miss the cake. Can't miss the cake. That's the best part. It is. Hey, you asked me about that old wives' tale the other night. The one where you put the piece of cake under your pillow? Yeah, that one. Have you ever tried it? Hang on a second. Read it. Dear Just Ask Jason. I'm ready to tell the man of my dreams the truth. Wish me luck. Wedding Cake Dreams. I don't understand. When I was 10 years old, I put a piece of wedding cake under my pillow, and I dreamt of you. And I don't know if that dream means we're meant to be together forever, or it was just indigestion, but I like you. A lot. And I don't care if I sound foolish, and I don't care if it takes you four years, or if you never feel the same way about me. I just wanted you to know it. Okay, I'll take that as...
