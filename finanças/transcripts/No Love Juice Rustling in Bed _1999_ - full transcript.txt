The last train for KITAO is arriving on track 10. Stay behind the yellow lines for your safety. Today, my six year long relationship ended. Nishizawa just dumped me out of the blue. Sorry. Don't... Not now. Not here... I don't know what to say. We've had good times, Tomomi. But I love her now. Our relationship was boring and going nowhere. But I thought that was the way that any relationship would be. RUSTLING IN BED Directed by TAJIRI Yuji Next stop, Kamisawa. Kitao, the last stop. Just one stop after mine, but I've never been here. You missed your stop? Yes. Same here. We have to walk to the main road to catch one. Huh? A taxi. Uh-huh. What will I do? It's too late to eat something. It's too cold to be alone. Don't look. I'm coming. Takao. Nothing. Whatever. You look young. Twenty. Does a difference in age bother you? I don't mind. But... Let's meet again. But... I'm 28. So? I want to see you again. I feel so alone. But I'm no longer so carefree. I need a push from behind before I'll have some fun. Hello. Oh, hi. So you broke up with Nishizawa. You don't waste time, do you? He called me yesterday to break the news. Unbelievable. You were together for ages. To cut a long story short he told me that you'd be devastated so I should take care of you. You're free today, aren't you? Let's meet. Nishizawa hates to hurt people. He's gentle and tender. I have something to do today. Like feeling sorry for yourself? I know you have time. I do but I don't. I mean... How about you and your love affair? Still going. The other day I met him with his son! The kid goes, "She's prettier than mom" We're totally freaking out. Enough about me. So today's out? Some other time then. Get a man. It'll get harder and harder. Know what I mean? What about you? Bye now. See you. If I didn't know that, life would have been much easier. But I do understand and I'm too old to pretend that I don't. I haven't had a man in my room for a long time. It's nothing special. I don't mind. Takao is not a macho kind of a guy. You know... This CD? Is this your taste? No. A friend left it here. I thought it didn't go with your collection. Good. I wouldn't know what to do with a folk-rock fan. What did you do today? Went to school, talked with friends, ate food and came here. Just like me. Let's eat. Are you taking my photo? Not for immoral purposes. I'm not made up right. It's OK. You take lots of photos? Yes. Can I see your pictures? What? I want to see them. You do? Do you have them? They're not exactly what I'd like to shoot. You have so many friends. Not really. Is art school packed with cool and beautiful people like they say? Superficially, yes. Is any of them your girl friend? No way. Nothing serious has happened. They aren't worthy. That's horrible. No. One of them is a nerd. Wouldn't shut up about Yamada Hanako. What? The comedian? Not that one. I guess you wouldn't know. Is this what you want to do? Photography? Yes. And video jockey at clubs. I want a digital camcorder. There's nothing I want to do. I don't know what I want. Not that I'm doing anything about it. I think a lot though. That's all. That's enough. I didn't even want to take them. They all ask for a snap just because I have a camera. I don't want to be stuck-up and say "no." I hate mementos very much. Photos are art, you know. I don't want to shoot a person I don't find interesting. That's why. Dark enough for you? Lift your hand. Isn't it too dark? No problem at all. Remove your hands. Spread them more. Lick your lips and look at me. Keep looking this way. Takao's warm body... I love you. Me too. Tomomi. Say it again. Tomomi. Ah, Takao. He is decidedly cool and indifferent to everything. When we are making love, he looks like he's going to cry. He's so adorable I can't help squeezing him. Are you going to stay over? Yes. Hey. Naughty! What? I can't believe it! Neither can I. A younger lover? I want one too! Get meat. The boy needs lots of it. My man's not exactly young. So no greasy food. Low-calorie and light. You are a lucky girl, you know that? Hello? Hello. I'm at my friend’s gig. I hardly know him but you know what it's like. I missed the timing to leave. Meaning...? I don't think I can make it. Sorry. That's okay. I just want to see you. Morning... Can I come in? I took the first train. Did I wake you up? It's okay. I wondered if I made you upset. I was anxious. I had to come. They must have thought I have a mystery lover. Are you hungry? No. I ate fast food on my way. Oh, then... Can I use the shower? My turn. I missed you. Me too. Say you missed me. Hey... I dirtied your bed. It's OK. What are you doing? Payback. I'm not wearing a rubber. You can come inside me. It's OK. I'm safe now. Come inside. I don't want to risk it. Is today paper garbage? Put these in there too. But they are your... I don't need them. Won't you look at them again? No. I never will. When school's over I won't see them. As if they never existed. Time flies when we are together. It does. You want to move in? No? I'm not used to being with somebody all the time. What's that mean? I don't feel comfortable. I've never felt this way before. It's been a while. What's up? Calling me suddenly. I want to return this. You didn't have to. But I do have to. We broke up already. She told me she'd never been with anybody longer than 3 months. I don't know anything any more. How about you? Any happy news? Don't look sad. He is so gentle. But I need something more. Room 405. We're checking out. I have to go home and squeeze Takao. Maybe I'll quit school. I'm bored. I know where it's leading me. I've lost interest. By saying these things he hopes to escape reality. Let me take your photo. Why? It's my turn now. I want to keep a photo of you too. I don't like that kind of thing. Why not? I mean... What do you want to keep my photo for? Because... I told you. I don't like mementos. I hate them. You're wet already. Do it to me. He's eight years younger than me. Not now, please. I don't want to go out. Me neither. Let's stay here. I don't want to work today. Any itchy spots? Um... right there. Your skin's so smooth. Uh? Yours too. No way. My breasts will soon start to sag. Why do you say that? Don't you think about how things will be? I don't. Why not? It's meaningless. OK, done Why not? Do you know people who only speak negatively? All my life I've been told not to do this or that. They've never told me what to do. They've never given me any encouragement. I grew up believing there's nothing to expect from the future. I want this to last forever. Don't talk about the future. We are together now. We are finished. No kidding? It's not something to kid about, is it? We've broken up. But you said you never would. I fell that way then. Can I ask why? I'm tired I guess. He's so uptight he always leaves at 12 midnight. When he left, I felt sorry for myself. I felt pathetic. How much longer can I be a tragic heroine? I thought I could love him forever. Sorry for being so emotional. It's OK. We take turns. I don't think your turn's coming up. But thanks. I appreciate it. Hey, there you are. Have you been waiting long? Not really. Out drinking? With a girl friend. Doesn't matter. Why? Why do you have to say that? Because I don't care. It's not a big deal anyway. I love you. Me too. I want to love you forever. Let me love you. Forever. I’ll love you forever. The next morning he was gone. That was the last lime I saw him. He called me once from Hokkaido. His friend asked him to go along. And of course he couldn't say no. We chatted a while and hung up. It's almost spring now. I had a daydream. I was with Takao taking a picture... as a reminder of our everlasting love. Next stop Kitao. "News for commuters Line to be extended." There's another station now. So maybe I am lucky after all. English subtitles by Tetsuro Shimauchi/Rosemary Dean
