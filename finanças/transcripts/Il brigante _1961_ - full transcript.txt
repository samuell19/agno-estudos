THE BRIGAND Based on the novel by Giuseppe Berto This film was shot entirely on location. Main cast: In October of 1942 I was 10 years old. Until then I had been living in a city on the Ionian coast, by the railway line. That very year my maternal grandfather had died suddenly, leaving my grandmother, old and alone, with a house and a little bit of land that they had rented. When the first, intense bombings of the war started to be heard, mainly along the length of the railroad, we all moved in with Grandma, who was living in the interior, on one of the feudal plots a few minutes outside of town. I had never seen Grandma before. She intimidated me because she and Grandpa were small tenants. She didn't always agree with her daughter, who decided to marry my father, a simple laborer. Miliella... Take Nino upstairs. He has fallen asleep. Nino, go to bed. - I don't want to sleep with Grandma. - Go up right now, you little brat! Come on, come in. - Can I come in? - Yes. Good night, Grandma. Good night. Bye. It was during the last, marvelous days before winter. Because of Grandma's illness, the fields hadn't been plowed or sown, and that worried my father. And I played those which would be my last games. Go on. Cut that hair off. You look like a little girl! Mama, what'll we do now? The field work is delayed, and your late husband did nothing. With the harvest, the landlord wants his pay. It's too much for one person. Sure, it's too much for one person. If only there were two more of us, they could till the soil while I plowed the flat part with the mule. And where are we going to find these men to help? Nearly all have gone off to fight. I'll go look for them in the town square! The few that remain are working for Don Natale Aprici, and the rest won't come to work for you, so as not to offend him. But we have to pay the rent! If we don't pay, our land is done for! - What will we do if we don't plant? - I know, I know... This is just what Don Natale wants. So our land will stay this way, which is good. But if I respect the contract, if I pay him... Papa's right. If we pay him, how is Don Natale going to kick us out? - Shut up, you! - Look at this rascal! What do you know?! This is the education they get nowadays! In my day, the son was the son and the father was the father. - How short it is now. - You've messed it up! Wait for me over there. - You're Maria Stigliano's grandson? - Yes. Come to catechesis on Thursday. We'll have coffee with milk. Greetings, Don Natale Aprici. Greetings, Don Tommasino. In good humor, as always? Don't miss that good humor. Nothing doing. We're working for Don Natale Aprici. Mr., with Don Natale Aprici. And you? Give me a light. Isn't that the son-in-law of Maria Stigliano? Go see what he wants. - Bye. - Bye. - But none of you are working right now. - Nothing to do. It's not possible. [Fascist slogan] WE SHALL GO STRAIGHT Hey, you... Everyone's working for Don Natale Aprici, eh? All right. It's dead. Before it was alive. Nino, let's go! HUNTING AREA Get away! Get away! Go! Get out of here! Go! Get out of here! Go! Go! Come out, don't bite. Let's go, Said. You're the grandson of Maria Stigliano? Come. Come on. Want some? Your dad... He was in the town square yesterday? My dad? Yeah. Was he there? - Who? - Your dad. He was? Yes. Don't be afraid. I'm a friend. And now...? - Where is he now? - In the field. - Working. - Let's go. Where? - Where? - To go look for him. Come on, Said! - What's his name? - Said. - He's not there. Maybe he's at home. - Then let's go find him. Said, don't provoke the ladies! - Find Papa! - He's with a policeman. He came to see if we had day laborers. They want him to pay the tax. Grandma's angry. I've already seen it. How am I supposed to pay if I don't have any laborers? If only they would come! I understand, I understand. In any case, if you do get any workers, you have to pay the tax. Understood? The agricultural contribution... The contribution. Remember that, OK? Good day, friend. - Mind if I have a word with you? - About what? You've been in the town square, looking for laborers. What have they told you? That they're already working. For who? For Don Natale Aprici... the land owner. So the land stays as it is, and you can't pay the rent. Do you realize how they've played you? Get out of here! Go! To top it off, they sent a policeman round. And who do they send? "The Capo," Ricadi, whose sister is going to marry Aprici. Listen, I'll find you two men. Plus me, there'll be three. So the mule, you and us three, we'll stick it to Aprici. Don't be afraid. They bark but they don't bite, if they show teeth. I'll go talk with Don Francesco Tomea, the baron's administrator. The land isn't Aprici's. But Aprici has it leased, he left it to you. Time has caught up with you. It's sow now or never. What'll you do? - You can't keep on waiting. - Nino, who is that? What are you doing? What do you want? Grandma. ...someone who doesn't respect the bosses. We'll have them all against us! "He who acts like a lamb, is eaten by the wolf." Remember that. - Good day. - Bye-bye. "He's eaten by the wolf." Remember. Hey! Hey! What did Papa say? He said no? Hey! If I tell you to do something, can you keep your mouth shut? What do I have to do? - Have you ever been to Turri? - No. It's two hours away, in the mountains. But you don't have to go all the way to Turri. Go to Acquafredda. Acquafredda is halfway there. Go up from the village, and keep going straight. Coast clear? - What? - There's no one over there? Come on, then. We're safe, cause the dog is here. To Acquafredda... you have to carry a message. Now? Yes, now. Come. In Acquafredda there's only the country home of Ricadi. - "The Capo"? - Yeah. You have to go... Open it! And tell something to The Capo's sister, Donna Giulia Ricadi, or to the servant, Ida. Careful. It's a secret. - What do I have to tell her? - Hold on... Now I'll explain. That's it. - Hey, hey! - What? Very good, buddy! The Ricadis had another house in the village, but during the grape or olive-harvesting season, they'd go up to their farm in Acquafredda, and sometimes stay there overnight. I was looking at Aprici, the land owner, who could leave us the land or kick us off of it. I was looking at "Capo" Ricadi, and at Donna Giulia Ricadi, the Capo's sister. How beautiful she was! What could there have been between her and Michele Rende? What is it? Nothing. - Be well, Don Natale. - Goodbye, Don Tommasino. Don't rush! Ida! Ida... - What? What do you want? - I have to talk to the mistress. - What? - I have a message for her. - What message? - From Michele Rende. - Quiet! - Tell her he'll come tonight... and whistle three times. Get lost, bird of ill omen. I didn't hear nothing! At three in the morning, three whistles. Three whistles! Hey! It was you who left the message... from who? - Michele Rende? - Yes. You have to return right now. Tell him I'm not coming. Not tonight nor ever! Understood? Tell him... It's too late now. And I'm engaged now. My brother watches over me. He can't come tonight, understood? It's late. Take this. But you have to go right now. It's for our own good. He can't come. I'm going. I'll arrive on time. - I saw her! - Close the door. I saw her! First... You've seen her? Yes... First I saw the maid, who got scared. - She was scared? - Yes. Later she came running and told me... "Tell him it's over. Tell him it's too late now". It's too late now... You hear that? "It's too late now". She looks down on me. She said you shouldn't come, not tonight or ever again. - That her brother's against it. - Ah, yes? And I've come to tell you that... even though it's late. Well done, pal. And you, what did you say? That Michele... is going or isn't? Michele's going. Good evening. Where were you just now? I had some things to do. And where have you been until now?! I had things to do. That's how you answer?! "He who acts like a lamb, is eaten by the wolf." Get upstairs! [...] from morning until night! Get upstairs! At your age I worked like a man and didn't run away from it! Up, I said! Hey there, pal. Did you see? Papa's got some workers. Miliella, come on! Hurry up, you need to change this. You hungry, buddy? - Want some? - Why not? Thanks. Keep working, lazybones! Hurry up! Silence, children! Silence. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Who created us? God created us. Little, little... Michele... - Who created us? - God created us. What did God create us for? He created us to love Him and to serve Him in this life. Stand up! That is how I saw, for the first time, Don Francesco Tomea, the baron's administrator, owner of almost all the land. We owed him coffee with milk. Give thanks to Don Francesco Tomea. - Thanks to you, Don Francesco Tomea! - Not me, not me. To the baron. And so, in the procession on the 8th of December, they dressed me up as an altar boy. There were many of us in the procession, the "Capo" at the front, and Don Natale Aprici, next to Donna Giulia Ricadi. There was also Corporal Fimiani, always the corporal. He had six children. He did what he could to raise those children. Only Michele Rende was missing. Criminals! Damn you! It's Don Natale Aprici who pays you! It's Don Natale Aprici who pays you, I know it! Tell Don Natale Aprici that I want 20 men! I want 20! And watch out... sooner or later the day will come when he'll pay for everything. - Fimiani, go see what's going on! - Yes, sir. And tell Aprici that Michele Rende isn't afraid of him or of "Capo"! You don't need money to defend yourself, you just have to stay standing up! A knife! Swine! Who was it? What happened? They killed Michele Rende! They killed Michele Rende! They stabbed him! What are you doing? Walk. That's it. That way there won't be any sign of it. All right, do you know who it was? I know as much as you do. Come on, back off! Get out! What happened? Foolishness, Don Tommasino. Michele Rende was fighting. - What's this about? - Michele Rende, as always. And the others, who were they? Outsiders, naturally. Why "naturally"? Because everybody from here was in the procession, Don Tommasino. Michele! Michele! Stay there and let me know if anyone comes. Well? The other night Aprici discovered that you came to Acquafredda, and I told you not to, because here... here everyone spies on us. Enough. It's over. I told you, it's too late now. It isn't over. I tell you, it's over. Leave me in peace. I'm marrying Aprici. I know why you're marrying Aprici. Because your brother's a scoundrel, and Aprici makes it so that he can rob people, and secretly... sell the flour. Did I say secretly? No. Authorized sales. Regulated. With the stamp of the "Capo", in full view of everyone. And if you marry Aprici, the money stays in the family. But watch out, there are people who have grudges against Aprici. Leave me alone. Leave me... leave me in peace! Before you wouldn't have said that. - And with me you don't talk like that. - No, no. I'm going to Acquafredda tonight. Wait for me! See you there! In Acquafredda. At 11. And leave it open. That same night Natale Aprici turned up dead. He'd been shot at around 11 o'clock, while he was crossing the town square. - But who was it? - Who knows? - When did it happen? - Last night. They killed him last night. - I heard shots. - Me too. Who could've fired shots? No one knows. - The truth is that he deserved it. - He was arrogant til the very end. You're right. The end of a braggart. Poor thing, he was a spoiled child. What a horrible end! Is it true that it was Michele Rende? Yes, yes. They say it was him. It seems that Michele was sleeping with Natale Aprici's fiancé. Oh, the "Capo's" sister. Michele Rende had been detained before dawn, and locked up in a holding cell. They captured him in front of his house around two in the morning, while he was going inside, and he didn't want to say where he was coming from. - What time did it occur? - Around midnight. They shot him point blank. - The bullet shattered his skull. - Holy Virgin, that's scary! Pardon me, Ricadi. Pardon me, Ricadi. Pardon... Ricadi. Excuse me! But I can't hold back. He was like a brother to me, practically family. He was going to marry my sister. Poor woman. Now it's mourning, despair... There's so much jealousy in this village! There's nothing but jealousy, hate... hate from all sides, slander... - Hate. - Get back! Pardon me. "Capo" Ricadi. Pardon. You can take him away. Nino, Said has been left alone. Come! Let's go! Michele! Michele! The day that the gendarmes called him to their headquarters to interrogate him about Michele Rende and Aprici, my father fired the two laborers because he didn't want to have anything to do with that business, even though, that way, he could no longer work the land. On that day I started to judge him. We worked from sun-up to sundown, but we knew that it was useless, because the rains had already started. I swear, she didn't tell the truth! That woman didn't tell the truth! - As sure as I have to die! - Don't shout! - Not even Ricadi has spoken the truth! - Quiet! I was with her that night, in Acquafredda. - What is it? - Get out of here! Out! - If you close it, we'll die of heat! - Out, I said! My son, you must understand me, my son. I've been a corporal for many years. Now they're about to promote me. The second lieutenant already has the papers on his table. Seven years as a corporal! I might agree with you, but if I go against them at all... I swear to you. Michele was in Acquafredda! Mother Mary. What are you doing here? He met with her that night. She didn't say the truth when they interrogated her. Donna Giulia didn't speak the truth. Come on, Ciccillo, don't cry. - Come on. - He's innocent. Michele is innocent. Come on, stop crying. No one's said the truth. - What is it? - Clean him and put on his underpants. But Michele could have said so. Why couldn't he say where he'd been? She had to say it, not Michele! I didn't say it either. But now that I've said it, I'm glad I did. Would you be able to say the same in front of the second lieutenant? I... Yes. Nennella! Nennella, I'm going out. But the pasta's ready! Why do you have to go right now? What, cat got your tongue? Speak up, dummy. Tell us what you know. That it wasn't Michele Rende. Oh no? And who was it, then? - I don't know. - You don't know! And you've come at this hour to tell me that you don't know? I know that Michele Rende wasn't there that night. Wasn't where? He wasn't there, because he was... somewhere else. And where was he? Speak! In Acquafredda, with Donna Giulia Ricadi. How do you know? You saw them? No? And then? I heard Michele Rende say that that night he was going to Acquafredda. Ah, so you heard him say that... Michele Rende. But you didn't see him. You didn't see him with her, not even leaving together. Furthermore, that night Ricadi wasn't in Acquafredda. They declared it in the inquest. Do you know what an inquest is? Well, in the inquest Ms. Ricadi was interrogated, along with the servant Ida, because the law is the same for everyone. And where were they interrogated? Here, in this very same office! And here, before the judge, she signed her written statement. You think she'd lie to a judge? Think the judge doesn't know how to do his job? Think that if Michele Rende truly had an alibi such as that, that he would have kept quiet? Do you think Donna Giulia Ricadi would let an innocent man be condemned? Keep playing, my son, keep playing... at your age, you have every right to. Actually, I work. So go work! And let others do their work. And you, corporal... I'll talk to you later. Corporal Fimiani continued on... and Michele Rende was condemned to 18 years in prison. It was summer. The wheat was being reaped... and my father couldn't pay the land lease. Later came the saddest days. Days of pain. Days that left the bitterest memories. Like the rest of the lands given for lease by Aprici, ours also fell under the baron's direct administration. So this is how we leave our house... We've been living on this land for many years. Many years, yes. - Is that everything? - Everything, Don Francesco. There's still the mule. Do your work. You've had bad luck. This land is very good. Take the mule out of the stable! What will you do with the house? Will you kick us out too? You can stay here until November, until it's sowing season again. I'm accountable to the baron. Go with God. You're taking the mule too?! The poor! The poor! Poor all year long! You're taking the mule?! I can't do anything else. I'm following orders. - So what do I do? - He who acts like a lamb... is eaten by the wolf. Scoundrels! Bastards! Damn you! I became unfeeling, rebellious, indifferent to my own pain. I won. - That's mine! - No, it was me who threw it! Get out of the way! - Let's go! - First play, then we go. Regular contract and a 5,000 lira salary! Work in Italy digging trenches at the beach! Come one, come all! 5,000 lira salary! 5,000 lira! The man of the house is leaving. - He's leaving. - We aren't eating? - Look at how you've made yourself. - Leave me alone! So that June my father left, enlisted for work in the war effort. I remember him like that, seated, writing wearily. While I look at him, I don't understand, just as I've never understood him. It seemed as though he had escaped, not as though he had sacrificed for us. Mama and Miliella worked as washers for little pay. I did nothing, aside from taking out the goats. It was in those days that I befriended Corporal Fimiani. - Today it's Vasile's widow's turn. - The son! Will you give it to him now? What am I supposed to do? Wait a couple of days? - Nino, it's hard to do my job. - Why? Because the law is one thing, like a shoe, and men, they're like many different feet. When I take them here or there, they ache. Before I was thinking... about Michele. Why is he in jail if he doesn't have to be? And then... the land. Who is working on it? Why is it no one's? And then... Did my father do the right thing by leaving? You think too much and work too little. Work was invented so we'd think less. Well, I'm going to take this telegram to Ciccio Bruno, that I've been carrying around in my pocket for four days now. Nino, how sad it is to be the postman, with all these deaths due to the war. That's for sure. If the war doesn't end, let's see who the the postman will be. In turn the war passed over our lands... suddenly. The allies disembarked on Sicily and the Germans escaped to the North. All of this happened unexpectedly, on a beautiful September morning. My goodness! Miliella, what do we do? Those shots provoked Grandma's fit, and she never got up from her chair... until she died the following year. Nino! Where are you? Holy Virgin! Where should I go now? Go, run, get a doctor! To the druggist! Go, go to the village, to anyone's house! Run! Go! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, open up! Doctor, please, open up! The doctor isn't home. He's gone north. The "Capo's" chair! Hurry up, they're coming back! Move! They've opened the shop! Quickly! - Down with taxes! - The war is over! School is out! The fascists are finished! - Get rid of that. - The Germans have left! Leave me! No, I'm a victim! A victim like all of you! Leave me! A victim! A victim of Don Natale! Of the rich! No, no! I'm a victim! I'm one of you! Help! Help, help! Blood! Blood! Leave me alone! They killed my sister's husband! They let an innocent man be accused! Killed out of envy for Mr. Aprici! Don Tomea against Aprici. Donna Filumè, where is your boss? My grandma has had an attack. Where's the pharmacist? He has a fever, Don Nicola! He's in bed and can't get up. He has a high fever, a frightful one. Slowly. One by one. Corporal... Corporal Fimiani! Corporal! Corporal Fimiani, you have to at least come. And who will stay here to maintain order? There's been a death! These days... There are many bodies in the streets, and I'm on my own in the village. I'm Corporal Fimiani... Only and always the corporal. But my grandma's had an attack! - The doctor! - He isn't here. No one's left here. Nino, put her into bed and give her hot water. It's obvious, huh? I've had a drink to get some courage. - And the dead person? - What dead person? The German soldier, in our garden. - You've killed him? - No. No one knows who did. You're sincere and I believe you. And as a soldier killed in war has done nothing but his duty, you should bury him quick... and deep. Come on! Come on! Slowly, one at a time, let's go! I'm Michele Rende. Come in. No... It's me. I've closed the door. - Where does that door lead? - To the stable, over there. - Where's your husband? - Not here. He signed up to work for the Germans. Who knows where he might be now! The land isn't ours anymore. Said! Said stayed outside. Stay, stay. Leave it. Stay! Good boy! And you haven't received any news from him? One time... One time he wrote to us from Germany. But now, nothing... Mama... He might be hungry. We'll dry the jacket by the fire. Don't bother. So they've taken your land? - And the house? - They’ve left it to us til November. And your husband enlisted so he could pay them? I need that rifle. Give it to me. Since he's not here, I'll take it. What do you want the rifle for? You don't have yours? - I don't want to go into town. - There are no gendarmes. - There's no one in the village. - I don't want to. - Where are the cartridges? - In the closet, to the right. Out of the way. This way, no one gave them to me. I took them. Same with the rifle. Understood? One... two... three. Second Lieutenant Bofia escaped, right? One more's not bad. Escape, escape... It didn't occur to them that I too would escape. The guards hiding in the shelter... and all of us in the cell, waiting... the bombs falling from the sky. But the bombs exploded just above the shelter. I'll hide it in the furnace of Turri, in Acquafredda. That way you can go and get it within a few days. Acquafredda... Open the stable door, buddy. Before dawn I'll be more clear-headed, and I'll leave. Go. Miliella, help me with Grandma. It's me. I've removed the stick from outside. You're good at what you do! What is it I do well? I went to see the second lieutenant and I told him that that bad woman didn't tell the truth. - I'll bring you a blanket later. - No need. Nino... Go to bed. Miliella's already gone up. - What is it? - You shouldn't've given him the rifle. - He took it for himself. - You're looking for trouble! He shouldn't have taken it. You didn't have to. What do you know? You're a woman. - It wasn't necessary. - Go to bed and quit squawking! Nino, is that you? You brought him the blanket at night... I heard you. You did well. I found the rifle in the stable. The Virgin has touched his heart! Dear God, let this storm pass soon! Come. Come! Grandma complained a lot. Now she can't speak. He didn't take the rifle with him. The Virgin has touched his heart. Take care of Grandma, Miliella. Keep watch! - You went to the stable last night? - Yes, I did. - Why did you go? - It was cold. I woke up... and thought of that poor christian, soaking wet... and took a woolen blanket. A blanket? Then what did you do? What did you tell him? Nothing. What did you say to him? - What did you say? - That he's innocent. That he has clean hands. And why did he have to stain them? That's how he gets them dirty, by being a coward! I'm sure... that, just like us, one day there'll be justice for him too. Men make the justice. If not, it's better to be born a woman. It was you who ruined it. If not today, then he'll do it tomorrow. - Miliella! - He won't do it. I'm sure. Later on came days that seemed prosperous. Sweets! Sweets, here! Sweets here! Cigarettes! - "Good?" Bono? - Bono, bono. Name. Your name. - Miliella. - Miliello? Miliella. "You pay me." You lived, you earned... The four freedoms shone on the four corners of the dollar bill, promises of a new world. Good or bad, there was money. And there was freedom, good or bad. Good day, commander. The radio arrived, American songs arrived, and democracy arrived. Hey, Fimiani, is everything going well in the village? Okay. - Bravo, commander! - Okay! - A coffee... and make it a special one. - Yes, commander. Good day, Mr. Mayor. In place of the "Capo" came a mayor, Don Francesco Tomea, chosen because he had nothing to do with the past. The packets of powdered soup arrived, that we would give to the hens. - Do I attach it? - Shall we attach it? Attach it! The second lieutenant of the gendarmes also arrived. A new one. He was a peaceable man. Later... autumn arrived. And with the autumn, came home the soldiers from the war... and from prison. They too, like the times, had changed. - The village! - The village! The women! My house! Mama, mama! - Mama! - My son, you've returned! - Giovannino! - Maria! My Mariuccia! Pataro! Hello, Pataro! - Hello, Pataro! - Hello, Pataro! Hello, ladies! - He was in jail and he has returned. - Nice uniform! It's special. How kind! Hello, ladies! Hello! - I'm happy to see you you all. - He's returned. You were in jail? - Where were you a prisoner? - Where was it? England? Canada? - Morocco. - He's a Turk! For years Pataro had been the desperation of the priest, because the women were affectionately unafraid of him... And this, unfortunately was the case with Marta and Maria. - You've come back, Pataro? - Yes, I'm here. - Pataro, you've returned? - Here I am. Hey, kids! Here! Hey! Come, run! Come on, hurry! - We're coming! We're coming! - Me too! - Papa, he's come home! - My Pasqualino! How handsome! You've grown up, Pasqualino! Pataro, look who's here. - You're Pinuccio? - I'm Pinuccio. Look who's here. - You're Rosina? - My papa! Papa's beautiful girl! My little ones! All my little ones! Come here, so he can see you too. And you, who are you? - What's your name? - Mariuccio. Yes, Mariuccio. Mariuccio? - And how old are you? - Three. Three years old. Three years old. Three! Mariuccio! Papa's handsome boy! My Mariuccio! Come, come with me. - May I? - Of course! Here, take this. - How much? - Oh, nothing. Thank you. Hello. - You're the Stiglianos? - Yes. - Are you still living in Costonni? - Yes. - Your mother's there? - Yes. - So today or tomorrow I'll go see her. - Why? Because. Marta, Maria... Get Mariuccio. - Go home. I'm going. - Go home, go home. Pataro, Pataro! - Pataro, the delinquent! - Like you, you've already told him! Shame on you for what you've done! Shame! How can you be with two women? I don't know how it happened... But what happened, happened. And now, which one will you marry? If I marry one, what'll I do with the other? Turk! I'm christian and I'm just. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! What's this? They're from Papa... He left for Germany on a train. He knew he wouldn't return. But, why? Was he sick? He said, "Give them to my wife if I don't return." And that's how it was... When I was a kid, and they would tell me "shut up, boy", I would think, "the day will arrive when I'll be a man." Now this day had arrived all of a sudden with those few words spoken by Pataro. Even though nothing in our lives seemed to have changed, suddenly everything had. It was like the season, which bore the face of winter, even though yesterday was summer. And so they take away their land. It's the baron who's taking it. - Hello. - Hello. For the first time, I too stood up against the wall looking for work. It's mine. - Wait, let me throw it now! - You already threw it! It's my turn! Hey! Buddy! Buddy! I'm talking to you. Buddy. Me? You want me? You're Maria Stigliano's grandson? - You're back? - Here I am. What about you? Here I am. At your house they told me you were here. Who told you that? Your sister, Emilia. Oh, at home we call her Miliella. Well, Miliella told me, "Nino is in the town square". Miliella has grown so much! And you, too. You've gotten big! But wait, isn't that Michele? That's Michele. Yes, yes. It's Michele Rende. Pardon... We thought you were... Yes, it's me. The very same. Michele Rende. How's it going, Pasquale Pruna? And you, Vincenzo Boletti? - And you, Marino? - Michele Rende's arrived! - And aren't you Salvatore de Cuttura? - That's me. And I'm Michele Rende. Well, how are things here? - Well... - Fine, fine. With the help of God. But Michele... - Why've you come back? - I've come back, is all. Does it seem strange? Speaks American! - Wasn't he in jail? - Yes. Come, look! Everything's in order. Fifth Battallion... It's written in English... "It is sworn that Michele Rende..." - Can I see it? - Yes, it's from America. How are these new times? - The times have changed... - But hunger is eternal. - And here, in the village? - The smoke rises and the water drops. It'll change! It'll change! - The Americans enlisted you? - Yes. - And that old story? - It's old. - It's old! - Now nothing matters! - That was a dirty trick! - An injustice! Fascist stuff! We all knew it wasn't Michele. Yeah, but those times are over with. Now we have democracy. Those are the wounds of injustice. If "Capo" Ricadi had spoken up... The 8th of September, Ricadi called out to him in the square. - Look. - May I? So's the second lieutenant. It's English. Pardon. What does it say, have they insulted you? They want to say that many things have changed. That's why this war was fought. - To give the world freedom. - Very good! Long live the four freedoms! The world is changing! - It has changed! - Changed... Changed, yes. Changed, but with justice. Changed according to justice. We're content that you're free among us again. Here there's a need for new men. I'm still the same. Always the same. Where's the tractor? Who took it? Who took it? What were we to do? We were sleeping. - And you? - It was windy last night. This dog didn't even bark. And we have the dog so he can keep watch over our things. And now what do I do? Do I tell it to the master? I heard something last night and thought it was you taking it. It's not an airplane, it can't fly away. It left a trail behind it. There are no more tracks. Where could this madman have gone? Here the grass has been crushed. The trail is this way. It's passed this way. - Where? - Over here. - I don't see anything! - Over here. Which way? But, who is this madman? This way. If you become a nun, I'll become a priest... I'll become a priest. Come on, Papa! FIELD OF THE FOUR FREEDOMS Throw the stones! Out with the stones! Out with the stones! Hey, Papa's darling boy! Papa! Papa! - Who is it? - It's Pataro! - It's Pataro! - Yes, it's Pataro! But what has he done? Has he stolen the tractor? - Where could he've gotten the tractor? - He's started to work! It's the baron's! Delinquent! What have you done? The tractor's mine! You've stolen my tractor! Get down! The gendarmes are coming! This land isn't yours! Occupy someone else's land! Get down! Careful! Back up! Back up! Crazy! You're crazy! Well done, Pataro! It's the tractor that was at Stigliano's house. - Look at that sign! - "Field... of the four freedoms". What's that supposed to mean? Get down, you wretch! No, just this little slice of land... Get down, thief! Just this little slice of land to plant my harvest! You've ruined me, thief! A thief is someone who steals! I've borrowed it! You stole my seeds! No, for each one, I'll give you back ten! For each kiss, I'll give you a hundred! I'll give you a hundred! There he is. And with this sun... Damn this heat! - And this, who wrote it? - Pataro. - What's his name? - Pataro. Pataro! - Call him. - Pataro! Let's go! Come on, go call him! Pataro! Pataro! Pataro! I left it at the Stigliano's and he took it. There it is! Get him down. Pataro! Listen, Pataro! I order you to stop! You have to return the tractor. You've stolen it. Don't get yourself into a mess, Pataro! The land isn't yours. Fine. Second lieutenant, the tractor's here. What should we do? - Bring it here! - But there's the canal! Then turn around! Damn you! Where's the tractor driver?! He's here! The tractor driver is here! And the troop is here too. Now you'll see! Second Lieutenant, good day! How are you? It's a time of freedom. Scoundrel, I'll split your face open! Calm down! - Marta, Maria, come here! - We're here. If we sow, they won't take our land. Sow everything you can. Go on! You too! Very good! - The Americans. - These are Americans too? Hello, countryman! Hey, countryman. Hello! The land is for pasture. If all of it gets sown, what will the sheep eat? The sheep have to eat... and I don't? Come on, sow! Hurry, hurry! Sow! We'll sow! The more that's sown, the more there'll be from Pataro. - Who is Pataro? - The one who's occupied the lands. You mean these lands aren't his? Silence! These lands are abandoned. They've never been cultivated! They've only been used for hunting! I don't understand anything! Come! Good day, commander. - Greetings. - Have you occupied this land? This is a question of principles. We're here to defend order and property. So you have to get off this land. You, commander, are a big American. A big engineer, a big lawyer, I don't know. You're from New York or Philadelphia. I don't know. You know many things, but you don't know the land. You pass by and drop a seed in the ground, and when you pass by again later, you see a tree, a big one. Why? Because the earth was waiting for that seed. Because it needed that tree. You people have done the same, Mr. Commander Engineer. You came here with a message of freedom. Everything new, the world changes. We believe it, because we were waiting for that message. Perhaps you said it as a joke, but us... we aren't taking it as a joke. This seed of freedom has grown. The plant is tall... now it can't be cut down. But, who's doing that? - What now? - What should we do, Don Francesco? Nothing, Second Lieutenant. But the land is for grazing. It's for the sheep. So you'll have to defend your wheat. My wheat! My wheat! My wheat! My wheat! My wheat! My wheat! My land! My land! And like the hair that grew on my cheeks, Pataro's wheat grew. If you become a nun, I'll become... With the new year the Americans left to go to the North. - And the wheat? - The wheat's growing! They left behind the guards that Don Francesco Tomea had asked to be armed, because... Pataro set a dangerous example. And they left Michele Rende with us. They left on a Thursday, and this happened the following Sunday. Do the birds worry about today, or tomorrow? They have nothing, but the Heavenly Father feeds them. The lilies of the valley sew nothing, but still wear the most splendid garb... Christians! The sheep! My wheat! What should I do? Where should I go? Who can I tell it to? I tell you all! I tell it to all of you! And you too, Don Francesco Tomea! In the presence of Christ! What can I do? My wheat! My life! My bread! My children's bread! Leave me! Leave me alone! The following morning, the town square was like a beehive. The baron has to understand! Careful what you do! If we don't get people, we'll find them in another village. And the work lost will be work lost. And what will you do if you don't give them anything to drink? If you give them nothing to drink, the poor beasts will die. And when they're dead, it'll be worse for you. You will have thrown it all away. And what'll you do then? - Misery and ruin. - Don't let yourselves be fooled... by people with bad faith who fill your heads with foolishness, and tell you not to work. The world has always been that way. There need to be people who work and people who command. If anyone says otherwise, he's doing it for his own interests. Don't be fooled! Michele... Don Francesco, the mayor, awaits you. - Come. - Let's go. Pataro, let's go. You come too. We'll talk about your land. Don Francesco Tomea responded to our arguments that if we didn't start working immediately, that more sheep would come from Apulia, and reduce the cultivable land even more. That's how it all ended up. Just as, when the wind blows, the first things to fly are the rags, they threw us out of the house where Grandmother had lived for so many years. It's too heavy. Leave it. Well, I need some way to let off steam. Here. Michele had found a room in the village. Sad winter. The empty days were long, and we would meet at Michele's house. In those days, a dark feeling was born in us, that if, after so many promises, the world hadn't changed, that it was the time to do so... But, how? From that day, Pataro was never the same. Leave me in peace. The peasants didn't dare raise their heads up. We spoke little but thought a lot. And outside they were suspicious of what we were thinking. Excuse me, is Carmelo Liotta here? No? Pardon me. Good day. Outside they won't stop til they know what we're doing. If I may. Greetings. Greetings. If I may. Greetings. I was passing and I heard voices. Yes, we're glad. - Are you on duty? - Yes. I mean no, I don't know. - I'm making the rounds. - The rounds, in this cold? That's why, so as not to walk around, I said to myself, "let's go in". Let's go in. So, what are you all talking about? - About nothing. - Nothing? You get together, drink, and don't discuss anything? No. I've already said it: if you get together and drink, of course you'll talk about something. That's what I say. To who? To myself. Before coming in I said to myself, "Fimiani, Fimiani... if they're discussing their own affairs, what can you do to them?" And then I said to myself, "So what? It's warm in there. One can drink, eat four chestnuts, and nothing is said." And if you do talk, who's going to overhear you? I'm hard of hearing. The apothecary gave me some drops. My wife gives me ten drops every night. Says it's going well. Goodbye. The following night, the night of Maundy Thursday, Bovone and I left together for the hamlet of Santo Stefano, which was 5 kilometers away. That's Santo Stefano! - Are you tired? - No. Have we arrived? Uncle Pietro lives in that house over there. I know. Where are we going? - Where are we going? - This way we make more noise. Uncle Pietro! Uncle Pietro! - Open up! - Who are you looking for? We want to see Uncle Pietro! - What Uncle Pietro? - Uncle Pietro Mezzacapa! Uncle Pietro doesn't live here. - Where does he live? - Over there! - Where? - At the end. - At the end? - At the end! - In the last house of the village. - Thank you! - Where do you come from? - From Grupa. - Yes, yes, from Grupa... - You've passed right by it. Thanks. Who's he looking for? Who does he want? - They're looking for Uncle Pietro. - Uncle Pietro? Uncle Pietro Mezzacapa. There, at the end, the last house on the right. - Thank you! - Thanks! Sorry, eh? - Who are you looking for? - Uncle Pietro Mezzacapa. - Yes, yes, Uncle Pietro Mezzacapa. - Over there at the end. At the end. Uncle Pietro lives just over there. Thank you. Uncle Pietro! Uncle Pietro! - No, no, you've made a mistake! - What do you mean I made a mistake? It's not on the left! On the right! On the right! - What did you say? - Not on the left! Not on the left! It's not on the left? - On the right! - On the right! - To your right or to my right? - To your right! - To your right! - Thanks! You called? We've made a mistake. We're looking for Uncle Pietro. - Mezzacapa? - Yes, Mezzacapa. He's not here. What is it? It's personal, excuse me. - Uncle Pietro! - Uncle Pietro! - Who is it at this hour? - Lean out! Lean out! Who is it? What happened? What do you want? Uncle Pietro, I have to talk to you. Come down. I need the tools. Ah, the tools. What for? We've come from Grupa. Come down, it's urgent. It's personal! I can't shout out why. You need the tools? - Yes. - Yes. What is it? Hey, who's yelling over there? Who's calling at this hour of the night? You see? They've woken up. Look, what is it? What's happened? - Who are they? - They're looking for Uncle Pietro. - Where are you going? - Go back to bed! - What do they want the tools for? - Who knows?! - Let's go and see. - Let's go. Hey! What is it?! Why are they yelling? They're people from Grupa, who want the tools. What kind of manners are those? Waking us up at this hour? Why my tools? The people of Grupa want to occupy the land! - It's a secret! - Where? What land? Pastureland, not farmable. Abandoned land. The grass... - Hunting grounds. - When? - Tonight. - Quiet! - Tonight? - Tonight? - This very night? - Well... Not tonight... A little bit before dawn. Folks from Turri are coming too. - And from Acquafredda. - Really? - Turri! See the folks from Turri! - The folks from Turri are coming! - Light the lamps! - In Turri the lamps are lit! It's true! Yes, so go do it. This is going well. - I'm going. - And me too. And us. And why weren't we going? Cause we're dumber than the Grupa folks? That land isn't ours. We can't steal it. No one's stealing it. We're going to work it! How are we going to steal it? Will we eat it up? - There are lights in Cassuri too! - Ah, yes! It can't be true. In Cassuri? - Come, come! - Let's see! In Cassuri too! Look at how many lights can be seen in Cassuri! - And in Grupa... - In Grupa? There the lights aren't lit. - It's blacked out. - So's not to raise suspicion. - The rendezvous is at 4 o'clock. - At the town entrance. - At the entrance, they said. - At 4 o'clock! The folks from Grupa are going to occupy the land! - The land! - At 4 o'clock! The folks from Grupa are going to occupy the land! It's our land, and we work for it! Our land! - Hey, where are you from? - Santo Stefano. Where are you going? To occupy the land, like the folks from Grupa. - Hey, where are you guys from? - Santo Stefano. From Turri! We're going to occupy the land! We're going to occupy the land! What for? Just to go along with the Grupa folks? But, they're really going to occupy the land? That's what they say. Don Vincè, you're not coming? - They're going to occupy the land? - So they say. Hurry, hurry, or we'll be the last ones. - Where are you going? - To occupy the baron's lands. - Where are you going at this hour?! - The fields! - They're coming from every village. - With the people from Grupa! Quickly, children! We're going too! Of course we are too! Did you know that we were going to occupy the land? - No. - Neither did I, but now I do. Come on, hurry up. We'll take him too. What, are we going to be dumber than the rest? - We can't take him. - Come on, hurry up. If he doesn't have arms to work, he has a voice to cry. Let's take the tools. I too will occupy the land. It doesn't matter that I'm old. It's my turn to have a decent piece for myself. Michele! Michele! Look at how many people! Look at how many people! How many villages did you go to? - Where have you been? - In Santo Stefano. And then in Cassuri. - And you? - In Turri and then in Acquafredda. Michele! Michele! They've come from Padula and Scilotraco! Michele! Michele! They come from plains and mountains. Three or four hundred! Let's go. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. So many have come! Who told them? Michele, my son! - Where are you from? - San Mauro. - And you all? - From Santo Stefano. - From Santo Stefano. - We're here. Michele is here. - And you, who told you? - We overheard it. Long live Grupa! Long live San Mauro! Long live Santo Stefano! Long live all of us! Our land! - Our land! - The land is ours! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Where are you going? The land isn't yours! What do you all want? Where will the world end up if someone shows up and takes the things that are yours? Rips them from your hands! If I took your farming tool, what would you say? I'd say... "Look at how it shines." And what does that mean? That it's shiny with sweat. That I work with it. Therefore, it serves me. But if it were just mouldering there, and you didn't have one of your own, and you needed it, I'd say, "Here! Take it!" Let's pass! Corporal, what should we do? Words are just words. But a shot is always a shot. Come on, come on! Everyone! Forward! - Damn it! - Why? Where are you going, cowards? Don't run away! - They're shooting! - The baron's guards! The guards are shooting at us! Don't run away, cowards! Stop! Don't run! Forward, forward! Come on, come on! Forward! They're shooting. Take cover. - Let's go! Forward! - Michele! What are you doing? Get out of here! Come on! Forward! Forward! Forward, women! Forward, women! Forward! Come with me! With me! Forward! Forward, women! Don't be afraid! Come with me! Bring the children! Back! Back! Back! They won't shoot us! Hey, what should we do? Are we going to shoot the women? Forward! Forward, all of you! Forward, cowards! Look at the women! Michele! Michele! - Michele! - Pataro! Pataro! Right now! What bad luck! What bad luck! What bad luck! Water, there's water! We've found water! Come on, cut the grass! Prepare the tent! We'll set up the tent, since we're going to sleep here tonight. It's the third night that we sleep here! As soon as we reach an agreement with the landlord, we must divvy up the land. Back, back! Get out, get out! Haven't you ever seen a car before? Please, get back! Don't get near the car! Yes, here's Michele! Bevone, Pruna, you, you, and you, with me. - Michele, the contract! - We want the contract! The lease, remember! Attention! Nobody move from here... under any circumstances. The commission is ready. And if someone comes to kick you out... don't raise a hand! Under any circumstances! Drop to the ground and let them drag you like weights! - Like a sack! - Like a pig! Yes, you too! Stay with the children. With the children they won't do a thing. Forward, Commission! Let's go! Michele, come back soon! Yes, we'll be back! With the contract written and signed! - Signed! - Maybe even with the Pope's signature! Let's go. That afternoon passed with a long wait. I don't know why they're taking so long. A car! A car's coming! A car! Hop to it, guys! You have to open the hatch. They're not coming back. These ones came instead. - They probably came to maintain order. - It's normal. That's how we passed that first night... cold. The dew fell from the stars. Come on, hurry up! And you all, back! The fence is for you too! No one will pass who isn't from your group. Come on. Let's get out of here. This poor creature's got sick. - A fever. - Calm down. We're going. You're right. We shouldn't have come! I was telling you, we shouldn't have come. How was I to know that things would turn out like this? Hey, he's back! He's coming back! He'll bring us news! - He'll have news of the commission! - About the commission! Did you see them? Have you talked to them? - Yesterday evening they left. - But you haven't talked? - They were taken yesterday evening. - Where? - To the city. - But why? To Rome? - So, Rome? - What Rome? No, not to Rome. To the city. - They've been taken to the city. - Without a word? Back! Where are you going? Whoever leaves can't come back! Hurry up. - Holy Saturday. - The bells are ringing. The village is empty. - Where've they been taken? - We've been waiting two days! We haven't had any news for two days! What happened? - Where's Michele? - Where are they? We don't know. - And the commission? - Where is the commission? You have to wait. Nobody's keeping you here. Who's keeping you here? Anyone who wants to leave, leave. We want to know where's the commission! Where's the commission? What are they doing? Where's the commission? We don't know. We're just in charge of order. At the first sign of a fuss, I'll have the camp vacated. That's the watchword. No one's holding you here. Anyone who wants to leave, leave. Whoever wants to leave, leave. That night it rained a lot. The next morning almost everyone left the camp. - Hey, you! - What do you want? Come on, boy! Next! Come on, there's still food left! Next time bring food. Hunger is brutal. Get in line! - Nino! - Mama! I've brought you two wool sweaters, and fresh bread that Miliella baked. My son, how thin you are! You haven't even eaten! Mama, I have to wait. Everyone has to make war, now that there's peace! Do you see? Do you see? They've returned! - They've returned! - The commission has returned! - We're going to see the commission! - The commission's here! Can you tell us what happened? Who have you spoken with? Are they giving us the land? We want some news! Where is Michele? He's not with you! - Michele Rende has been arrested. - Where? - In the city. - Why have they arrested him? For the murder of Natale Aprici and for having escaped from prison. Pull from there! Don't leave any campfires burning. It's dangerous! Let's go! - Wait! - Get on, or stay behind here! - No one. No one's left. - And here? Everything's in order, Corporal. What a waste of time! Here too. No one's left. Nino! What are you doing here? Nino. Go back home. Go on. Accompany him. They've left... They've all left. God damn it! I said... - "Don't move from here!" - Michele! Michele Rende! You've escaped? - Yes. - Holy mother! So, you'll let me leave, Corporal? Let... Let me leave, Corporal. I'm your friend. But what about Natale Aprici? They didn't arrest me for that! You know that I didn't kill him! They know everything! Everything! Even you know! They arrested me because they couldn't arrest everyone else! One hundred, two hundred! Kick them out! Kick me off the land, leaving me a liar, after all the promises of freedom and a new day! They killed Pataro! "And with the others? What'll we do? Easy... Michele Rende has an old conviction. Who cares if it's an old one? Who cares if it's just or not? Who cares why he didn't serve it out?! He went to war, risking his skin behind enemy lines! For the first thing it was always him! To do the impossible they always had him! Bravo, you're a hero! You have a silver medal of honor!" Michele... "Because, if we arrest him, the fear will arrest the others." That's how it's been. They've had the fear for centuries... It has set down its roots, in the head and in the heart. Fear of everything... Of the master, of hunger, of the next day. Fear... Michele, follow me! You have to come with me! Corporal, don't do this to me. I'm innocent. I haven't hurt anyone. You can't do this to me! I'm innocent, Corporal! - I won't hear you, nor do I want to! - Just one hour! Let me leave! You didn't see me! You're a man... Michele, I'm in uniform! Michele! Michele Rende! Help! Everything's burning! Serrarossa, Vallelunga! Let's go! Quickly! Everything's in flames! It's all burning! Who was it? Who started the fire? Someone must have! It wasn't Michele? What's happening? He's here! He's here! Arrest him! It wasn't the carelessness of the shepherds. You know who it was. There in the middle are 1,000 sheep and more than 20 men, trapped. If you lot don't help, you're complicit. Come on. Hand out the tools. Help! Don Francesco, they don't want to help. Note down the ones with crossed arms. Take him to the station! Fast! Come on, come on! Hurry! My God! - My God!. - Be brave, Bronte! Hurry up. Hey, you. Tell Michele Rende that he'll pay for this. Tell him! Don't let him escape, cause he did this! Tell it to Michele Rende! It wasn't Michele. He shot Bronte. Thanks to the Virgin. If Said has escaped, that means that he's here... Close by. Alone. Maybe he's down there, hurt. - He needs me. - What are you doing? He needs me. I'm going to him. He needs me! - Is the kid here? - Yes, sir. - Bring him to the others. - Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Didn't I give you permission to go? Go and enjoy your leave. Unpaid leave, awaiting trial. - Here, Second Lieutenant. - Awaiting trial! Your sister has left with Michele. You know where he is! What are you doing here? Take him inside. Bring him in with the rest... Bovone, Giovanni, Pasquale, and Pietro Mezzacapa. You're the brother of Emilia Stigliano? Answer. Yes. You have to tell us where your sister is. I don't know. No one's seen her since Sunday. She's disappeared. It's your duty to tell me where she's gone. And don't tell me you don't know, because I don't believe that. Get your hands off me! I'm an honest citizen. Everyone knows me. I pay my taxes! This is an abuse! A real abuse! Your sister has disappeared. - The others are here. - Yes. She disappeared from the house more than three days ago. And you haven't even filed a report. Don't you know you're required to do so? That the responsibility for this lies with you and your mother? You don't know that? Speak! You don't know? Speak! What do you gain by playing dumb? Speak. What does it cost you? I only know that she left. And before leaving, she didn't tell you anything? You, her brother... She didn't say anything to you? She leaves like that... And before she goes, she doesn't say, "I'm going to the woods, who knows where?" - She didn't say it like that. - Uh-huh, and what did she say to you? Nothing. Where are the others? - The dossier. - The dossier. Where is your sister? Where is Michele? Speak! Nothing... Foolishness. I'll be back shortly. - Where are they taking us? - It's just a moment. Enter. To the dungeon. Why? Go in with them. What have we done? Are we delinquents for you to haul in? So now's the interrogation, so that madman can take it out on us. You know that "Gendarme" Bronte has died, cause Michele shot him? And your sister... she ran away from home to live like a wolf in the forest. All of those women have a screw loose. Winter's starting just now. Eat. - No. - Come on, eat. I won't eat. He hasn't eaten. They killed Pataro. It was on the day of Good Friday that they killed Pataro. Killed treacherously by the camp guards Silence, no singing! I sing softly... It was on the day of Good Friday that they killed Pataro. It was on the day of Good Friday that they killed Pataro. Killed treacherously by the camp guards But the blood that was shed wasn't spilled in vain. But the blood that was shed wasn't spilled in vain. Because the wind spread it like it spreads the grains. I told you, no singing! No regulation says so. No singing in that way! - I only know this way. - So don't sing at all! Softly, softly. But the blood that was shed wasn't spilled in vain... Softly, softly, this song was sung. Not only in Grupa, but in the adjoining villages, and later in the more distant ones. Everyone, softly, softly, but all together. So much so that now, it was like the wind in the trees, that makes a leaf rustle. But all of them together make a formidable noise. Hey Baron, take care, pay attention to the lesson. Hey Baron, take care, pay attention to the lesson. After Good Friday comes the resurrection. Bovone, Pasquale Pruna, and Uncle Pietro were interrogated that same night. After that, they let them leave. Tenese was allowed to leave the next morning. You're not interrogating me? You, come with me. To the town hall? What have I done? Don Francesco Tomea, the mayor, wants to talk to you. May I? May I? Tenese! Nina, what are you doing here? The mayor sent for me. He said he had to talk to me. - You too? - That's right. I have to talk with you both. Come, Tenese. Come here, Nina. When will you get married? We've been waiting three years, but these aren't good times. Yes, sir. They are good... Because the baron has decided to hand over the land. It's a risk to give it directly to the laborers. It's better to give it to four large tenants than to 200 peasants. The times are like that. It isn't good that the bad example set by Grupa is spreading outward. And before the protests grow, it's best to settle the matter quickly. But the landlord is always the landlord. He made concessions until you lot rose up against him, burning forests and farms. I, as mayor, have already made this speech to the others. To you, on the other hand, I want to say something different. Michele Rende will end up badly. - He's just shot a gendarme. Tell him! - I don't know where he is! Why do you want to make like you don't know where he is? Leave me! You're drunk. I have gray hairs from my work. 22 years! And now I'm under investigation because of Michele, who escaped! You know how much pension they'll give me if they send me home? 7,000 lira a month! "Corporal Fimiani", always the corporal, I would answer: "present!" Tell Michele Rende... 7,000 lira! I ask for half the pay and I work like a man. Get out of here! For charity, my mother is dying from hunger. - And I don't know where to go. - To Michele Rende. Go work with him. He'll take you! He already took your sister! Even though he didn't take her to work! It's necessary for Michele to know that this way he's doing more harm than good. Like the other night, when he burned the farm in Cassuri. He can't ask for justice if he goes against justice. He's already done everything he could. We won't forget it. He got dealt a bad hand, I know... But now it seems as though they're giving us the land for real. And now, what'll he do, always up in the mountains, like a wolf? - My daughter... - Mama. It's really you, isn't it? Don't cry, Mama. It's me. Don't worry about me crying... It's because I'm happy. Nino, did you see? Miliella has returned. She's returned. Mama, I'm back. - You've returned forever, right? - No, Mama. What? You're leaving again? Yes, Mama. We're leaving. I've come to get married, because... I'm expecting. Holy virgin! - You're marrying and then leaving? - Yes, Mama. You're with child... one that I'll never see. Don't say that, Mama. At least have a glass of wine. Let it not be said that in this house there isn't even a glass of wine. - Here. - Thank you, ma'am. I’ve brought you Said. And Michele? He can't come to the village. You know that. No, that's enough. Thank you for the drink. You don't remember me, but we met a long time ago. When Michele brought those two workers, one of them was me. - Don't you remember? Years ago. - No. Well, I'm going to see the priest. I'll tell him that a dying old man wants to confess his sins. That'll get him there. - See you there. - Go. I'll see you there. We'll meet at the church, with the priest. See you there. Good evening! Good evening. Good evening. Miliella is waiting. I'm the witness to marriage. They're marrying tonight then... They're marrying at night and leaving. - They're going. - Michele has to leave. Did you know that Miliella is expecting? - A child I'll never see. - Don't say that. - Nino! - Miliella, Mama's coming. - Miliella! - Mama! - Miliella! - Mama! My daughter! - You're here! - Let's go, Mama. You're marrying in secret. We're here now. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. The priest... The priest wasn't able to come? Tenese has gone to get him. You'll be happy. I'm leaving. The wounded man who had to lose a hand, he's not happy. It's the least bad, but it's always bad. Think of the wounded man, not the hand. Nino has come too. Hi, buddy. Hello. You're all here to see me off. Only Fimiani's missing. They want to retire Fimiani, because they say he let you escape. With all the children he has, he's ruined. The priest is late. Michele... - Did you know they'll give us the land? - I know. If it's from fear or love, I don't know. But they're giving it to us. From fear, from fear... Michele... Michele... It's not true that we're happy. Here. This year the harvest has gone well, so we've all chipped in a little. But it's not true that we're happy. Even though I'm leaving you, you've given me money for the trip. - Who's it from? - From Paragallo, Puntone... They know why I'm leaving... From Pasquale Pruna, me... Half so I'll go, half for the shame of kicking me out... From Pietro and also from Pataro's two widows. They're sincere. Michele... Michele, someone's coming. It's Tenese... It's Tenese with the priest. Michele! Michele! The gendarmes are coming this way! They're coming from Grupa and Santo Stefano. - They know you're here. They were told. - It couldn't have been by Tenese. I hope to God it wasn't him! Get out quickly. Nino, take care of your mother. Stop in Turri. No one'll look for me in the furnace. And whatever you do, don't take the path. How tired I am, boys! My God, how cold it is! How cold it is! They're here. They're all around. Let's head toward the village. They're there too! Go home, Miliella. Go alone. They won't do anything to you. I'm staying with you. I'll go with you. So, all we have left is Tenese's house. We can still get there from here. - But I don't trust... - ...Tenese? Yes. If he didn't warn the gendarmes, then why didn't he come back? He could have been arrested in the village. Maybe they saw him talking to the priest. Either way... Tenese's house is all we have left. We have to pass that way! Said... Go home barking. Barking, Said. Said! Miliella! Miliella. Nothing... It's nothing. I'm fine. What an unhappy life you've made with me! Happy... Happy! The day will come... with the sun. Where will we escape to? Where will we escape to? Help me get up. Help us. Michele. Michele, come. Come here! Hide yourself. I'll go ahead to see. I'll give you a signal from the door if there's danger. Really... They won't do anything to me. Miliella! Miliella! Miliella! Miliella! Michele! Michele... I... I... I... I couldn't see... I didn't know... With your cape, I thought... "Michele knows, and he's coming for me." I didn't know it was Miliella. Don Francesco told me that only the head of the family has the right to land. This is what the mayor, Don Francesco Tomea, told me. I've wanted to get married for three years. And Nina, my fiance, tells me all day that they're giving us the land. All day that they're giving us the land. She told me she'd talk to the gendarmes if I didn't go. Like that, from morning to night. All day! She'd repeat to me... Hey! Nina! - What is it? - Who is it? Nina! Nina! No! She's back... Just like she had promised. My daughter! Nino... - Why is there no one in the village? - Everyone's in the town square. They're giving out the land... at the town hall. Nino... I wanted to tell you many things. But now there's no more time. The truth is that... How much harm I've done to all of you! To all of you... to her! But there's something I did right, isn't there? Right? What did I want to tell you...? Ah, yes... They've marked me like an animal, with a brand that angers all who see it. Perhaps... I should have gone to jail and served the sentence, even if it was unjust. Who knows if it wouldn't have been better. But you would have to be a saint... But I am not, because I was born in this violent land! And so are we all, enduring! Suffering! Suffering and enduring! Like the mule loaded down, suffering blows! Oh, if the rebellion had broken out the blood would rise to the eyes, and the cause would make you tremble! He's here! In the Stiglianos' house! Come out, Michele Rende! The transfer of the land to the laborers who are here... Inside! Inside, let's go! Everyone inside! Don Francesco Tomea! To the rooftops! Get behind them! Come on, to the rooftops! Michele! Michele Rende! Put down the gun or I'll shoot! Don't shoot! Can't you see that idiot Fiamini in the town square? Drop it or I'll shoot! I'll shoot! I'll shoot! Shoot! Where? What was it? What happened? Who was it? Who was it? It was Fimiani! Very good, Fimiani. Very good! Get back! Go home! Get back! Go home! THE END
