TALLINN Knight Clingenstain, we’re landing! Boy, get out of the way! MELCHIOR THE APOTHECARY I almost had it. I thought you’re a master rat catcher. You don’t know me, Melchior. No one knows me yet! There is no profession in the world that I cannot master. Like there is no maiden whom I cannot get. I see you’re doing well. Oh, this... Shall I tally up old bills? This is not money. This is something better. It will give me everything I want. Well, I’ll be damned! Today is such a good day! Pour me a herb liqueur. Today could be my name-day – Kilian Day. Sheriff, I haven’t... Melchior Wakenstede! The Apothecary. On behalf of Town Council, I appoint you as my deputy. Come along, Deputy Sheriff. And hurry up! Sheriff! - Sheriff, wait! - What the... I’m no Deputy Sheriff. The Commander has ordered us to the castle. - Me too? - Yes, you too. You did catch a murderer once. Rinus, the leper. What is this? The gate should be open! Why is the portcullis down? No one is allowed to leave the castle. The Commander’s orders! Open it! The Commander is expecting us! Quickly! Raise the gate! I don’t know anything! I haven’t killed anyone! Honorable Commander, we came faster than we could... Please, don’t... Silence and peace are best against a headache. Apothecary Melchior. Chopping the head off is even better. Why did you bring that younker along? He’s like a bloodhound, instantly picks up a trail! I appointed him temporarily as my deputy. - Bloodhound... - Take it! There he is! The maid was here. This is Knight of the Order, Clingenstain. The one who executed all the pirates on the Island of Gotland? The very same. Arrived in town last night. He was killed last night. Good guess! With a single blow. Melchior! What are you doing? Gotland coins. Well, pick up a trail, bloodhound. Guards! Guards, over here! Check these baskets. There’s nothing here. Let them through. - Now through the gate – and I’m free! - Men! Arrest this dog! Give me the sword! The sword is there. That is my official sword! Whose sword is this? This is Knight Clingenstain’s sword. How did you know it would be in this pile of shit? Everyone has a sword in the castle, but Knight Clingenstain’s head was cut off with his own sword. Which means that the killer came from the town. He had to hide the sword somewhere to get out of the gate. This is my sword. Why did Knight Clingenstain come from Gotland to Tallinn? He was on his way to see the Land Master of the Order in Wenden. - The direct route is through Riga. - What difference does it make? Look for the gold chain and you’ll find the murderer! What chain? Knight Clingenstain bought it yesterday – it’s missing. There are seven goldsmiths in Tallinn – Brockhorst, Casendorpe, Mennyck... That one, Casendorpe! With his dim-witted servant. Who else was here from the town? The Dominican Prior. Knight Clingenstain wanted to confess. - The Prior does not come alone. - He had a monk with him. And that hunchbacked brother who collects the alms. All kinds of people were here! Just like new! When I went to his room, he was already dead. I can’t have my guests decapitated. Until the murderer is caught, you are accountable! I’ll send the heralds to announce it throughout the town. No one escapes from them! But maybe we should talk to the goldsmith and the Dominicans first. That will be your duty! Master Blackhead! What is this? It’s a candied orange. - My favourite. - I know, miss Hedwig. I spoke with your father. - You are so beautiful, Hedwig. - Yes... I cannot accept it. Master Blackhead, I ask you not to come again! - But Hedwig! - Farewell, master Blackhead! Hello, Ludeke! Is master Casendorpe home? Look what I brought you. Hey, Ludeke, in the old days, when you were still a soldier, you must have killed many men, yes? Sure, it’s a piece of cake for you. But tell me, have you... killed anyone here in Tallinn? Did you... do it yesterday? Chopped a head off yesterday? I told you not to disturb me! Master Casendorpe. Young Apothecary! The Sheriff appointed me as his deputy. - Very good! - I come by the order of the Sheriff. I’m just finishing a complaint to him. Is this town governed by Lübeck laws or these crooks from the Order? Father, I have to go out for a moment! - Oh! - Miss Hedwig. Father, you must not get upset again. I’m sure everything will work out. Maybe already today. My precious. Master Blackhead has invited me to walk by the moat. He’s waiting in the yard. Don’t keep the Master of the Brotherhood of Blackheads waiting! Well? What is the young Apothecary looking for? You mentioned something about crooks? Yes! I was robbed of my most beautiful and precious work! - At the castle? - Exactly! - That damned Knight Clingenstain! - He didn’t pay the correct price? He offered me some beggars coins! I refused of course! - These? - Yes, exactly, these! I’d have rather stuck them down his throat! - And then? - Then what? What... Ludeke! What? - Let me go! I am the Deputy Sheriff! - That’s enough, Ludeke! You wanted to know what happened next? Knight Clingenstain took my chain and had us thrown out! That bastard must be brought to justice! Too late, he’s dead. Ludeke confessed everything. The Court will find out whether Ludeke killed Knight Clingenstain on his own initiative or on your orders. Knight Clingenstain was a pig, but not such a pig. The Sheriff Wentzel Dorn publicly announces that a vicious theft with a monstrous killing took place in the castle last night. The murderer chopped off the head of his victim, the famous Knight Clingenstain, to steal his priceless gold chain! If anyone knows or has heard anything about the whereabouts of the murderer, they must immediately appear in front of the Sheriff and give a statement of all they know. - What’s your name? - What? What’s your name? I’m Gerke. Did you lose something? I’m from Riga. I’d like to become an apprentice for your master. A letter of authentication and two recommendations. - Damn! I forgot them home. - You’re lying. You’re pretty smart. Yes, I’m lying. I don’t have those papers. I’m not from Riga, I came from Rostock through Gotland, yesterday. With the same ship which brought here that knight whose head was cut off. Knight Clingenstain? Yes. Will you speak with your master? Me? No, I won’t. Why not? You already spoke with him. You are the... Yes, Apothecary Melchior. I could see it right away. So, what do you know of apothecary business? Well, I know that... That you should put a plaster on a cut? Yes, and I know herbs. I know about wounds and burns. Of course I know less than master Apothecary. I came to lean from you. I don’t have time now. I have something to take care of in town. Is this about that fetching boy and his golden sweetheart girl? I heard what they were saying. The boy said, “Let’s go to your father.” The girl said, “No, take it back immediately.” You will stay here today. You may sell only herb liqueur. - You can sell it with these. - What does it cure? Everything. And if you steal from me, I’ll have the Rostock executioner chop your fingers off one by one. Understood? But you can kill as many rats here as you wish. - Check the cart! - Stop! Everything looks fine. Goon. Melchior! That’s what I thought, it was you. - Where is it? - What? The gold chain, you damn fool! Put it back and let’s go! Oh, wait-wait! What a catch! Honorable Commander, let me explain. You can explain to the executioner. Honorable Commander, first of all, Knight Clingenstain was not killed for a gold chain. Knight Clingenstain’s corpse was scoffed, disgraced. It seems to be a revenge. Secondly, to cut off someone’s head with one blow, only a strong man with killing skills can do that, not a boy like him. There is another option... The killer is you. Me? Come here. I could have your friends hand and your head chopped off. It would be much easier. I wouldn’t have to listen to your endless speeches. Melchior! You, bloodhound, go run into town now and return with the killer in your teeth. But your friend will stay in the cage for now. If you don’t find the killer, the executioner will have him. Oh, master! I only sold herb liqueur. And put everything in the account book, just as you said, every coin! I ate one. There were so many orders for tomorrow, I started here myself, following the recipes... At first it went a little wrong, but now I got it right. I guess it’s still something too much. You could also put proper covers on the recipe book. I like this town. Why? In this town, it is possible to become an apothecary at a young age. I guess so. What would I have to do for this? You’d have to kill the only apothecary in town. Who did it? One crazy leper. Why? He wanted to smear the blood of the apothecary all over his body. He thought he could get rid of his disease that way. Had heard it from somewhere. And that apothecary was your master? Yes. My father. The bed is for the Apothecary. Good night. Only you can save us! And now calmly, from the beginning. The day before yesterday, when father came home from the castle, he was devastated that Knight Clingenstain took his chain. Then I realized... that this is our chance. And sent Kilian to steal the gold chain? But it wasn’t theft, he just... took it back! And you believed that your father would then prefer Kilian to Master Blackhead? Yes. And then you heard about the murder? And you sent Kilian to return the chain? Yes, I was afraid we would be accused of murder. And now he is missing. Maybe something happened to him. - I’ll find him. - Yes, please! My engagement with Master Blackhead will be announced tomorrow at the Brotherhood of Blackheads’ beer party. - And then it’s all over. - It’s never over. Believe me. You will be together soon. Thank you. Thank you! Vicke, where do I put it? Just put it away. Oh! Vicke! A thousand apologies, master Apothecary. This old wall was poorly laid, it does not support weight. - Peace and blessings, Melchior! - Hello, Hinric! It’s as if war has broken out here. Back to work, men! The church is being rebuilt. It takes them forever. Charging money is the only thing that this Vicke is good at. Human life is the only thing getting cheaper these days. The Prior was sick before, but after meeting with Knight Clingenstain, his health has become much worse. And your hunchbacked brother accompanied him there? I accompanied the Prior. Wunbald only came along to collect alms. Knight Clingenstain was the only one who threw him some coins. Wunbald is with the Prior again. Honorable Prior, I brought the head of St. Roch from the chamber of relics to invigorate your health. A peculiar state of play... I am here because of the killed Knight of the Order. At least he was able to confess to you before he died, and have his sins forgiven. What? Knight Clingenstain did not confess? What did he want then? He wanted what he did not need, and he got what God deemed necessary. He wanted what he did not need... that is, he demanded something from the Prior that he was not entitled to. And he got what he deserved... Death. What happened between them? I don’t know. I was waiting behind the door. They spoke in a whisper? Did you hear anything? Hinric! The life of an unfortunate soul is at stake. Only you and I can help him. Knight Clingenstain demanded the Prisoner of Tallinn. - Who is it? - I don’t know. What have prison matters got to do with the Prior? They were supposed to meet again the following day, but... by then Knight Clingenstain was already dead. The hourly prayer is about to begin. You know your way out. Get out of there! Quickly! Run! Is anyone hurt? Search there! Look! Look there! There! Vicke! Vicke! Vicke! Vicke! Open the door! The door is locked. - Master Blackhead, did you see Vicke? - No. - What happened? - The cloister wall collapsed. Collapsed? Dear God! But our altar? Praise be to God! I come here – with the blessing of the Prior – every morning to change the candles. The world is perishing before our eyes. The house of God is collapsing and heads are being chopped off in the castle. But you are the Deputy Sheriff now. You know already? A merchant must know everything. Knowledge is money. The Sheriff should set a bounty for catching the killer, - that would help right away. - The murderer set it already. He stuffed the dead man’s mouth full of coins. Oh dear God... Honorable Prior, I searched everywhere. Then someone had to take it away. It needs to be found. I rust you, Wunbald, to find it. You know who you are and why you are here. The wall of the Prior’s chamber must be repaired immediately. I shall speak with Vicke. I don’t think he’s here. Then with someone else, it cannot be left that way. Men! Where can I find your master? The Prisoner of Tallinn? What was Knight Clingenstain thinking! Asking the Dominican Prior about prisoners? He should have asked me. How many prisoners does Tallinn currently have? Just one... your father’s killer. Rinus? You behave, Rinus, or you’ll have no food! The son of the Apothecary Melchior! Does the name Clingenstain mean anything to you? Knight, we did everything as you commanded! All pirates must be flayed alive, heads off and no last rites! Rinus! The Knight is here. Now tell me everything. Knight Clingenstain... We killed all the pirates on Gotland, except one. He was too clever. Fooled the death himself. Who was he? Wigbold. Is he in Tallinn? He can be anywhere... Rinus! Rinus is not the Prisoner of Tallinn whom Knight Clingenstain was looking for. I’d have him tortured, but the flesh of a leper is dead. He wouldn’t feel anything. It’s someone else. - Men! Do you know where Vicke lives? - Over there! Vicke! Did you get it? Not yet. The Apothecary was there. But I know now, who has it. Do what is necessary. Tomorrow the Prisoner of Tallinn will be back in the monastery. How are you feeling? What happened? I don’t know. A hunchbacked monk carried you to the front door late at night. - A hunch backed monk? - Yes. He tried to slip away unnoticed, but I saw him. I was up, waiting for you. Put it away. Does anyone here make any sense at all? Everyone is as crazy as those two fools out there! One has crooked eyes and the other has a bulging butt! What kind of people are they? There is no order! To attack my Deputy! So Vicke pushed you out of the window? - I’ll have him thrown into prison. - It couldn’t be Vicke. But who then? Sheriff... slow down a bit! Left, right, left... - Good day! - And to you. And left, right, left... Well, men! Go on! There’s no sign of Vicke here! Killed last night. With a single blow. Close the door. The same killer! The head cut off and money in the mouth! Knight Clingenstain was killed with a single blow and there were Gotland coins in his mouth. Vicke was killed with a knife and the head was hacked off after that. There are Tallinn coins in his mouth. These murders are similar, but I think the killers are different. I that hunchbacked Wunbald was there, then he cut Vicke’s head off and pushed you out of the window. And then took me home? Oh, Melchior! Just in time! Coming through! Let me through! Move away! It’s Wunbald! Poisoned. - Poisoned? - Wunbald is poisoned! Pain must have wrecked his insides. There’s no smell. Probably arsenic. - We need to talk to the Prior. - The Prior will not see anyone. He is not feeling well. Wunbald meant a lot to the Prior. The Prior is fully aware that this man is not brother Wunbald, but a former criminal. The only pirate who escaped the Gotland massacre, Wigbold! The same man Rinus was talking about. These are old battle wounds. But from here, Knight Clingenstain’s men skinned him alive. The beheading failed. His hump was caused by the executioner’s sword! And now... Upon meeting Knight Clingenstain in the castle, Wigbold takes revenge for the death of his companions. He chopped off Knight Clingenstain’s head. As Knight Clingenstain had once ordered to do the same to him. And stuffed the coins thrown in the donation box down his throat! Wunbald then came to the monastery with a huge burden of sin... .and the Prior took him under his protection. Was Wunbald the Prisoner of Tallinn, whom the monastery was hiding? In the name of Christ! Did that hunchbacked brother kill himself? Why does Reverend Rode think so? He came to me last night for a confession - and said-- - Reverend Rode knows very well that a confession is a secret protected by the sacramental seal. Also in his church. Hinric! Was Rode Wunbald’s confessor? No. The Prior was. I demand an answer! Reverend Rode, did you know brother Wunbald well? No, I personally didn’t know him. But everyone recognizes that hunchback, even in the dark. I will not leave this like that. There is nothing more to do here, everything is clear. Wunbald killed both Knight Clingenstain and Vicke, and then poisoned himself! Wunbald always seemed suspicious to me. Hiding his face under that hood. A vicious theft with a monstrous killing took place two nights ago at the castle... Stop shouting there! I already found the murderer! Go and do something useful, you fool! Look, there’s Master Blackhead’s bride! Oh, I’d love to be the Master of the Blackheads just for once! I have to tell the Commander that we found Knight Clingenstain’s killer. Then he releases Kilian. No, I shall tell him myself. Tonight, at the Blackheads’ party. He’ll choke on his beer! Did poppy tears have to be heated? Yes, of course. - Don’t forget the Cannabis indica seeds! - I already added them. Gerke. If it happens that I’ll be out late again, then you may... Antonius. The rat-catcher. I met him by the town wall. Apothecary Melchior. Our master. Anyway, I’ll be out late again tonight, you may rest in the bed until then. The beer tasting party of the Blackheads! We shall determine the truest and bitterest German style brew! I shall wait until the Commander asks about the murderer, and then, as if it’s nothing... Let’s not announce the engagement yet. Let the party gain pace and then. Yes, of course. This was a beer of the Great Guild, a Hamburg style brew... Next to compete will be the Blackheads’ dark brew... Praise the Blackheads! And the Dominicans’ copper-colored brew! Praise! Wouldn’t the hon our able Prior of the Dominicans tell us how and under what circumstances brother Wunbald ended his own life? Weill Now it’s my turn! Honorable Commander! Good beer-tasters! - I have determined with my investigation-- - I just came to tell you... Isn’t self-murder a mortal sin for the Dominicans anymore? Wunbald did not kill himself. He did kill himself! I can say no more, as I’m bound by the secret of the sacramental seal! “Secrets protected by sacramental seal are no longer sacred “if the confessant has taken his own life,” as Saint Thomas Aquinas has said. The Blackhead is right, let the Reverend Rode speak! Let him speak, but I want to say-- No! Wunbald did not confess. He did, I saw him myself! He confessed to me that he had killed two people. - By chopping off their heads! - I was supposed to say that! He killed Knight Clingenstain for his gold chain. And he killed mason Vicke because he witnessed the murder and the robbery! Honorable Commander, I was supposed to tell you that. Order! - Order, please! - As a confessor, I realized... Everyone please calm down! Wunbald could no longer live with the knowledge that he had taken the lives of two innocent men. - I warned him, of course. - You... murdered... Self-murder is the greatest crime against God, - but what can you do... - You! You... poisoned... Something is wrong with the Prior! Wunbald... Arsenic. The Prior’s beer has been poisoned! No, that is not possible! We all drank from the same barrels! - The Prior drank from there. - I know. But the good name and hon our of the Blackheads are as precious to me as the word of God! Acquitted! Honorable Commander! Now that everything is clear and Kilian did not kill anyone, he must be... What is clear here, bloodhound? If Wunbald poisoned himself, then who poisoned the Prior, the Prior himself? No one has poisoned themselves. But Wunbald confessed! How many people could the pirate Wunbald kill in his lifetime? - A hundred! - Maybe. And now he couldn’t live knowing that he had killed two? And poisoned himself? But Rode confirms that Wunbald went to church at night and confessed... Melchior? Melchior! Wunbald... That’s how easy it was. The Prior tried to give us one last clue before he died. He threw his amulet towards the poisoner. Some believe that an amulet full of arsenic protects you against plague. I’ve heard of that. Well? Now what? If it’s powdered bones of a saint, it will make the water cloudy. While arsenic would fully dissolve and become invisible. Hair falling out and white spots under the Prior’s fingernails indicate long-term inhalation of arsenic. If it was long-term inhalation, why did he die in convulsions, as if he had drunk a large quantity of arsenic at once. But his beer was clean? What are you thinking? Head hurts? I think it’s time for all of us to go to sleep. Who... who is... who is the... Are you not afraid that he’ll bite you? His poison doesn’t affect me. How so? My mother gave me their poison when I was a kid. Just a little, drop by drop. Of course! The poison is its own antidote! This means... that Wunbald and the Prior were poisoned at the same time, yesterday morning. Wunbald died immediately, but the Prior’s body was used to the poison, so he died only in the evening! - Where is the recipe book? - Here! That piece of leather you gave, fit exactly as a cover. The leather is old, with traces of some rusty chain. A book! It’s a book! Gerke, what would I do without you! The Commander needs a word! You! Come along! - Is Kilian free to go? - Certainly. We’ll cut off the little thief’s hand and he’s free. That was not our deal. You were right. Knight Clingenstain was not on his way to the Land Master. He was supposed to fulfill a secret mission and wait for a ship that would take him to Marienburg, to the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. That ship arrived in Tallinn last night, with Knight Clingenstain’s entourage. He was supposed to take away the Prisoner of Tallinn sheltered at the Dominican Monastery. But you’ll never guess the actual identity of that prisoner. A book wrapped in leather and bound with an iron chain? Sit. - I want it! - So does the killer. Bring me that book! Release the boy and give him Knight Clingenstain’s gold chain. We have a deal. I brought back the Prior’s amulet. And I need to speak to brother Hinric. Not brother Hinric, but the new prior of our monastery. Who is he? Interesting state of play. Honorable Prior. The Prior is no more. I am just his unworthy replacement. I came because of the Prisoner of Tallinn. Do you know what this is? - But this isn’t the book I’m looking for? - No. The same image is on the cover of the “Prisoner of Tallinn”. The symbol of the Knights Templar. That heretical order was destroyed. Their most dangerous book was secretly brought to Tallinn, the farthest corner of the Christian World. It was bound in chains and immured in our monastery for eternal imprisonment. Knight Clingenstain demanded this book. This was a sign for the Prior that evil had launched a new attack. And then the monastery wall collapsed. As if the book itself wanted to leave the monastery. The Prior sent Wunbald to search for the book and now they are dead. When did you find out about it? The Prior left a letter. I have to send it to Rome. And what is the mission of the new Prior? To get the book back to the monastery? The monastery does not have the money to buy it back. There is no such money in Tallinn. The enemies of Jesus and the Pope... all over the world would offer untold riches for it. Tallinn and the monastery have lost their prisoner for good. Master Blackhead? Yes. God told me to exchange the merchant’s cloak for a pilgrim’s robe and visit Compostela for the salvation of the Prior’s soul. This is a big decision. But the wedding? I do not know a more worthy maiden than miss Hedwig. But we could never be a couple. I always felt that her heart belonged to someone else. Someone, who probably deserves her more than I do. The Prior was like a father to me. It is not within the power of man to bring back the deceased. But, we can punish the evil. Tomorrow, the secret of the Prior’s death will be revealed at the Town Hall. Praise the Lord! So the murderer will be revealed? Yes. And executed? A man can only aim the bow. Whether the arrow will hit the mark, is in the hands of the Almighty. - May God protect you on your pilgrimage. - Melchior! I will postpone my departure and I will definitely be there tomorrow. God bless you and the Sheriff for this victory of justice! But if they ask, do we have witnesses? I’ll get all the necessary people to the Town Hall in the morning. This job of the Deputy suits you quite well. I’m not so sure. But you played at it quite well. And you play the apothecary well. Of course. I want to become an apothecary. May I ask something? Yes. All apothecaries have wives, why don’t you? Was it a question from Gerke as in Gretchen? Or Gerke as in Gertrude? As Keterlyn. Why did you do it? I can’t tell you that. - But what happens next? - No one must know. Gerke will just disappear. Gerke may disappear, but I don’t want Keterlyn to disappear. In the name of Tallinn Town Council and Lübeck Law! Deputy Sheriff, Apothecary Melchior Wakenstede, wishes to give a statement! Honorable Commander, respectable members of the Town Council. Indeed... Brother Wunbald murdered Knight Clingenstain. Not because of the gold chain, - but in revenge for... - Not relevant! In revenge for an old quarrel. However, the remaining three: Vicke, Wunbald and the Prior, were killed by a man who is in this hall today. Stop stalling, spit it out! One day that man overheard Wunbald and the Prior talking. And he learned a secret that promised untold riches. Not relevant! When he killed Vicke he tried to imitate Knight Clingenstain’s murder. Cutting off his head, stuffing coins in his throat. All so that suspicion would fall again on Wunbald. But no one knew about the coins in Knight Clingenstain’s mouth. Only the Commander, me and my Deputy. Exactly! I told the killer about it myself. At the monastery. The Prior pointed at this man at the moment of his death. By grabbing Hinric’s black robe and covering his head with it’s edge. Black... head... Why wasn’t this blackhead afraid to drink from the poisoned Prior’s jug? Because this beer was not poisoned. This blackhead poisoned Wunbald and the Prior already in the morning. This blackhead is ready to give up Tallinn’s most beautiful bride and a good dowry, because a better deal is waiting for him in the great wide world. I postponed my pilgrimage, because I hoped to hear the truth about the death of the Prior, my spiritual teacher. Is this your truth? Deputy Melchior Wakenstede, do you have any witnesses who can confirm your words? Right! Now... now it is like this... This is like... I ask again, do you have any witnesses who saw these murders? No, I have no witnesses. In such case... Wunbald killed Knight Clingenstain and mason Vicke and then took his own life. Our hon our able Prior died of a stroke due to old age. So it was, and Amen! Honorable Commander... From the Commander. Melchior! You are not a man but an angel whom God himself has sent to save us. I heard what happened in the courtroom, injustice prevailed? Why did Master Blackhead do it? Because of a very important book which he wants to take out of town today. There, take it to your father-in-law. Where are you going! Come here! I’m so sorry... I’m so sorry! A thousand apologies! THERE IS NO CURE FOR LOVE Is there an apothecary here? I’m the Apothecary. - And what is your name? - Melchior. - Surname? - Wakenstede. - This is for you! - Oh! From who? Let’s say from friends. Please, come in. You have a beautiful town. Kind people. And where does miss come from? From Rostock. Because of this book, many people have killed each other. - Miss didn’t say her name! - Keterlyn. - And surname? - I’d like to be a Wakenstede. But let’s see how life goes. MELCHIOR THE APOTHECARY
