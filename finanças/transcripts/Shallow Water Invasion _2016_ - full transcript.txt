♪♪ Narrator: FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, MOST SHARK SPECIES RULED THE DEEP. BUT THE SHALLOWS JUST GOT A LITTLE MORE CROWDED. AROUND THE WORLD, REPORTS OF SHARKS MOVING INTO SHALLOW WATER ARE MAKING HEADLINES. SHARK SIGHTED ...ONE BEACH, TWO ATTACKS 90 MINUTES APART. -DUDE! GET OUT! -GET OUT THE WATER! GREAT WHITE SIGHTINGS OFF THE EASTERN SEABOARD... OH, THAT'S A SHARK! Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THAT UNUSUALLY WARM WATER IS LURING DOZENS OF GREAT WHITES AND HAMMERHEADS TO THE COAST. Narrator: NOW, RESEARCHERS ARE LOOKING INTO THE SCIENCE BEHIND THESE HEADLINES... WOW. HE HIT THE CAGE! Bolte: COMING IN HOT TOWARDS THE DECOY. ...TARGETING HAMMERHEADS AND GREAT WHITES... SHARK, SHARK, SHARK! ...AND USING THE MOST ADVANCED SHARK CAGE ON THE PLANET... HE'S COMING RIGHT AT ME! ...THEY WILL TRACK SHARKS IN REAL TIME AND USE SPECIAL LOW-LIGHT CAMERAS TO CAPTURE SHARK ACTIVITY... THEY'RE EVERYWHERE! ...AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN. HE'S RIGHT ON TOP OF ME. TOGETHER, THEY'LL WORK TO DISPEL THE HYPE AND REVEAL THE TRUTH BEHIND... OH, MY GOD! ...THE SHALLOW WATER INVASION. RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE LARGEST SHARK STUDIES IN THE WORLD IS TAKING PLACE AT THE REMOTE ISLAND OF GUADALUPE. Johnson: SO, IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE WORLD, THESE WHITE SHARKS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MURKY, MESSY WATER. BUT HERE, THEY REALLY HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DEPTH. Hoyos: EXACTLY. THEY ARE VERY SMART. SINCE THEY KNOW THAT VISIBILITY IS GREAT, THEY REMAIN VERY CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM IN ORDER TO AMBUSH THEIR PREY. THE WATERS AROUND GUADALUPE ISLAND ARE NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL SHALLOW. JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE SHORE, THE DEPTH DROPS OFF DRAMATICALLY. HISTORICALLY, RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT MOST ADULT WHITE SHARKS SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME HUNTING AT 400 TO 900 FEET. Johnson: THE ISLAND OF GUADALUPE IS KNOWN AS A FAIRLY DEEP-WATER AREA. IT'S WHERE THESE WHITE SHARKS ARE FOUND IN DEEP, CLEAR BLUE WATER. BUT WHAT THEY FOUND RECENTLY IS THAT THESE SHARKS ARE ACTUALLY MOVING INTO SHALLOWER WATER. Narrator: OVER THE YEARS, DR. MAURICIO HAS TAGGED OVER 70 SHARKS. BUT THE DATA WAS COLLECTED BY ONLY SIX RECEIVERS LOCATED IN DEEP WATERS AROUND THE ISLAND. HE WAS ONLY GETTING A SMALL SNAPSHOT OF SHARK ACTIVITY. SO HE'S NOW PIONEERING A TAG THAT TRACKS SHARKS IN REAL TIME. -OH, THERE WE GO! -IT'S HERE. AND HE'S DISCOVERED SOMETHING THE OLD DEEP WATER RECEIVERS COULD NEVER DETECT. SHARKS ARE SPENDING TIME IN WATER LESS THAN 60 FEET, EXTREMELY SHALLOW FOR THE ISLAND. Hoyos: THANKS TO TECHNOLOGY, NOW WE ARE GETTING TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THESE ANIMALS. BUT I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST MYSTERY ABOUT THE WHITE SHARK IS IN THE SHALLOWS. WHERE DO THEY COME? WHERE DO THEY GO? DO THEY STAY IN THE SPECIFIC PLACES? DO THEY GATHER? ARE THEY PATROLLING THE AREA? ARE THEY JUST RESTING? WE DO NOT KNOW. Narrator: 60 FEET OF WATER MAY NOT SEEM SHALLOW. BUT IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL HUNTING DEPTHS SCIENTISTS HAVE DOCUMENTED IN THE PAST. AND IT FITS A PATTERN SEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] HOLD ON! LET ME GET A DIFFERENT SHOT. WE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. REPORTS OF SHALLOW WATER SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN INCREASING SINCE 2013. EVERYBODY, GET BACK NOW! CAPE COD MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES BECOMING A WHITE SHARK HOT SPOT. AND MOST RECENTLY, ON THE COAST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE WATERS AROUND MANHATTAN BEACH WERE ROCKED BY A VISITOR FROM THE DEEP. EVERY BEACHGOER'S WORST FEAR -- A YOUNG MAN BITTEN BY A GREAT WHITE SHARK. Narrator: SOON AFTER THIS INCIDENT, SCIENTISTS AT LONG BEACH UNIVERSITY BEGAN A NEW STUDY. SO WE NOW KNOW THAT, BETWEEN MAY AND ABOUT OCTOBER, WE'LL GET THESE SMALL WHITE SHARKS LITERALLY NO MORE THAN 100 YARDS OFF THE SHORELINE. Narrator: OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, CHRIS LOWE AND HIS TEAM WILL STUDY GREAT WHITE MOVEMENTS ALONG THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. Lowe: SO SOME OF OUR NEW, EXCITING UPCOMING PROJECTS ARE OUR USE OF AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES TO TRACK TAGGED FISH. USING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY, WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE ROBOTS THAT WE CAN PUT IN THE WATER THAT WILL GO OUT AND FOLLOW AND TRACK ANIMALS. Narrator: MAURICIO'S BRAND-NEW TAGS ARE GIVING HIM SIMILAR RESULTS, BUT HE'S JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS STUDY. Johnson: IS THAT THE ONE THAT YOU WOULD CALL CHUGGY? CHUGGY IS A MALE GREAT WHITE, ABOUT 16-FEET LONG, THAT HAS AN IDENTIFYING CUT ON THE UPPER PART OF HIS TAIL. MAURICIO HAS SEEN HIM AT THE ISLAND EVERY YEAR SINCE 2006 AND RECENTLY TRACKED HIS MOVEMENTS. CHUGGY, LIKE MANY OTHER GREAT WHITES AROUND THE WORLD, HAS BEEN PATROLLING SHALLOW WATER. MAURICIO WANTS TO FOLLOW HIM AND CATCH HIM IN THE ACT USING A SELF-PROPELLED SHARK CAGE CALLED THE EXPLORER. ALL RIGHT. SO, TODAY'S THE DAY. LET'S DO IT, MAN. THE INITIAL PLAN IS TO FOLLOW A SHARK LIKE CHUGGY AS HE MAKES HIS WAY TOWARDS THE SHALLOWS, HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF WHAT'S DRAWING GREAT WHITES CLOSE TO SHORE. Massyn: USUALLY, WHEN YOU'RE AROUND GREAT WHITES, YOU'RE STUCK TO A SHARK CAGE. YOU CAN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE, AND YOU CAN ONLY OBSERVE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. THE EXPLORER ALLOWS US TO CRUISE WHEREVER WE WANT AND FOLLOW THE SHARKS TO REALLY SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN WE'RE NOT AROUND THEM. Narrator: MAURICIO AND GRANT WILL FOLLOW THE EXPLORER WITH A CHASE BOAT. DEVON, DEVON, DO YOU COPY? WHILE DEVON AND THE TEAM TRACK CHUGGY INTO THE SHALLOWS OF GUADALUPE, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, ANOTHER SHALLOW WATER RESEARCH PROJECT IS JUST KICKING OFF. THE GREAT HAMMERHEAD IS AMONG THE LARGEST SHARKS IN THE OCEAN. IT GETS TO A MEASURED 20 FEET. NOW, IF WE WERE TO SEE ONE OF THESE ON THE FLATS, IT WOULD BE VERY RARE. EVERY TIME I TURN ON A NEWS FEED OR LOOK AT THE INTERNET, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT HAMMERHEADS MOVING INTO SHALLOW WATERS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT UP ON THE BEACH, LIKE A FOOT OF WATER. ♪♪ Narrator: HAMMERHEADS HUNTING IN SHALLOW WATER HAS BECOME A HOT TOPIC. Reporter: IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE HAMMERHEADS ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST LINE AND THE PEOPLE SWIMMING, SURFING, KAYAKING, OR BOATING IN THESE WATERS. Narrator: IN 2015, THERE WAS A SPIKE IN HAMMERHEAD SIGHTINGS NEAR SHORE, WHICH LEAD TO BEACH CLOSURES AND COMMUNITIES ON EDGE. FOR NOW THESE WARNING SIGNS WILL REMAIN POSTED. Narrator: TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHY HAMMERHEADS COME INTO THE SHALLOWS, DOC GRUBER IS TEAMING UP WITH MARINE BIOLOGIST STEVE KAJIURA. Gruber: STEVE HAS BEEN WITNESSING SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE BEHAVIOR FROM HAMMERHEADS, AND THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO BEGIN THIS STUDY -- SHOWING HAMMERHEADS IN SHALLOW WATER IN ACTION. Narrator: TOGETHER, THEY'RE USING A HELICOPTER TO TRACK HAMMERHEADS IN THE SHALLOWS OF SOUTH FLORIDA. Gruber: OH, MY GOD! BEAUTIFUL. OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC. -WHOA! -LOOK AT 'EM ALL RIGHT BELOW US. WHOA! Narrator: THIS IS A SUPER SCHOOL OF BLACKTIP SHARKS. EACH YEAR, THOUSANDS OF THEM FLOCK TO THE SHALLOWS. AND STEVE BELIEVES THE HAMMERHEADS FOLLOW THEM AND HUNT THEM THERE. DOC'S PLAN IS TO DEPLOY RUVS, OR REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO SURVEILLANCE UNITS, TO CAPTURE FOOTAGE OF THE HAMMERHEADS HUNTING IN THE SHALLOWS. Gruber: A RUV IS LIKE A LITTLE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. AND IF DR. KAJIURA'S THEORY IS RIGHT, WE WILL GET SOME FANTASTIC VIDEO OF HAMMERHEADS PREYING ON THESE BLACKTIP SHARKS. Man #1: HERE'S THE HAMMER. Man #2: HE'S ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF THE SHADOW OF MY HELICOPTER. SO HE'S, UH... HE'S GOT SOME SIZE TO HIM. OH, HE'S IN CLEAR, SHALLOW WATER. -HOW BIG IS THE HAMMERHEAD? -12. 12 FOOT? IS HE, UH, CHASING SPINNER SHARKS? YEAH. DYKOKE, THE SHARKS ARE STARTING TO HEAD RIGHT TOWARDS YOU NOW. HERE COMES ONE. THERE, THERE, THERE! THERE'S THOUSANDS OF SHARKS AROUND THIS NORTHERLY ONE. Narrator: THE TEAM'S RUV CAPTURES THE HAMMERHEAD AS IT MOVES INTO THE SHALLOWS, JUST ABOUT 200 FEET FROM THE SHORELINE. THE RUV CAPTURED THIS HAMMERHEAD CLEARLY HUNTING THE BLACKTIPS. SO, NOW WE WANT TO SEE EXACTLY HOW THESE HAMMERHEADS ARE USING VERY SHALLOW WATERS TO HUNT. SO, WE'RE HEADING TO THE BAHAMAS TO DO JUST THAT. Narrator: WHILE DOC AND HIS TEAM GEAR UP FOR THE NEXT PHASE, UNDERWATER CAMERAMAN DEVON MASSYN IS SEARCHING THE SHALLOWS OF GUADALUPE ISLAND FOR A SHARK NAMED CHUGGY. Massyn: HOLY... Narrator: THIS DRAMATIC DROP-OFF, KNOWN AS THE PINNACLE, ILLUSTRATES THE UNDERWATER LANDSCAPE THAT IS TYPICAL OF GUADALUPE. WHOO-HOO-HOO! THE SHARKS THAT INVADE THE SHALLOWS RETREAT BACK TO THE DROP-OFF FOR MANY HOURS OF THE DAY. OKAY, BE CAREFUL. I HAVE SEEN HUGE SHARKS AROUND IT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT ONE! OKAY, WE CAN SEE IT. WE CAN SEE IT. IT'S HUGE! Massyn: HOLY CRAP! RIGHT THERE, YOU CAN SEE IT. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. HOLY CRAP! Narrator: COMING UP... HE IS REALLY AGITATED. -WHOA! -WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! Massyn: I GOT SOMETHING DOWN HERE! IT'S SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO YOU. Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THAT UNUSUALLY WARM WATER IS LURING DOZENS OF GREAT WHITES AND HAMMERHEADS TO THE COAST. Narrator: AROUND THE WORLD, SHALLOW WATER SHARK SIGHTINGS ARE DOMINATING THE NEWS. NOW, TWO TEAMS ARE INVESTIGATING THESE PHENOMENONS TO FIND THE SCIENTIFIC TRUTH BEHIND THE HEADLINES BY TARGETING THE TWO LARGEST SPECIES TO ENTER THE SHALLOWS -- HAMMERHEADS AND GREAT WHITES. ♪♪ RIGHT NOW, UNDERWATER CAMERAMAN DEVON MASSYN IS TRACKING CHUGGY, A 16-FOOT GREAT WHITE THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY ENTERING THE SHALLOWS OF GUADALUPE. BUT CHUGGY HAS MADE A 180 BACK TOWARDS THE DEEPER PART OF THE ISLAND, AND HE'S NOT ALONE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT ONE! OKAY, WE CAN SEE IT. WE CAN SEE IT. IT'S HUGE! LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK! Massyn: HOLY CRAP! CAN YOU SEE A TRANSMITTER? MAURICIO HAS NEVER SEEN THIS 17-FOOT GREAT WHITE BEFORE. HE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE RESEARCH. Hoyos: WE ARE VERY EXCITED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE JUST SAW A BIG MALE, AND I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE IT. SO I THINK THAT IT'S A NEW SHARK. IT'S VERY HARD TO GET THE BIG MALES, AND IT'S VERY GOOD TO TAG NEW INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE THE SAME SHARKS COMING BACK OVER AND OVER. SO WITH THIS, WE WILL KNOW THE PATTERNS OF THESE ANIMALS. WHEN DO THEY COME? WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE PATROLLING, IF THEY ARE SOCIALIZING WITH OTHER ANIMALS, IF THEY ARE MATING. SO NOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NOBODY HAS SEEN BEFORE. Narrator: THE ULTRASONIC TAGS ALLOW MAURICIO TO FOLLOW THE GREAT WHITES IN REAL TIME. IF HE CAN FIND THIS NEW SHARK, IT WILL GIVE HIM MORE DATA TOWARDS UNLOCKING THE MYSTERY BEHIND GREAT WHITES MOVING INTO THE SHALLOWS. Johnson: LET'S GET A BUNCH OF BAIT IN THE WATER, SEE IF WE CAN DRAW THAT BIG, BIG MALE UP AND GET A TAG IN IT. OKAY. LET'S GO. WHILE THE GREAT WHITE TEAM PREPARES A TAG, IN THE SHALLOWS OF THE BAHAMAS, DOC GRUBER AND THE SHARK LAB HAVE ARRIVED AT A HAMMERHEAD HOT SPOT. Massuger: HOW YOU DOING, MIKE? Gruber: HAMMERHEADS ARE ADAPTED FOR SHALLOW WATER. THEY'VE EVOLVED IN THAT STATE. MY QUESTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT THEIR ROLE IS. HOW DO THEY USE SHALLOW WATER TO THEIR ADVANTAGE? WHAT IS IT ABOUT HAMMERHEADS THAT MAKES THEM SO FORMIDABLE IN THE SHALLOWS? Narrator: DOC GRUBER IS TEAMING UP WITH CAPTAIN MIKE NEWMAN, AN OCEAN ENGINEER AND DIVE MASTER WHO HAS SPENT YEARS WORKING WITH THE SHARK LAB. -HI. YOU BROUGHT THE RAY. -WE GOT THE DECOY. YEAH. DOESN'T IT LOOK REAL? THE TEAM HAS CREATED AN EAGLE RAY DECOY TO STUDY THE HAMMERHEAD'S PREDATION STRATEGY IN THE SHALLOWS. WE FIRST STARTED THIS HAMMERHEAD DIVE ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, BUT WE NEVER FOCUSED ON FEEDING ECOLOGY. AND THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE IF NOT FOR THE EAGLE RAYS AND STINGRAYS. Massuger: WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN THE REALLY SHALLOW WATER IS LARGE AMOUNTS OF THESE RAYS, BUT ALSO LARGE AMOUNTS OF THESE HAMMERHEADS COMING IN. THE ONE THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE, HOWEVER, IS VIDEO FOOTAGE OF IT HAPPENING. Narrator: GREAT HAMMERHEADS IN THE SHALLOWS HAVE BEEN MAKING HEADLINES. LIFEGUARDS AGREE THIS MARITIME SITUATION IS EXCITING. THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. WHILE MANY STORIES DOCUMENT SHARKS STEALING FISHERMEN'S CATCHES, THERE ARE OTHERS THAT CAPTURE THEM HUNTING RIGHT ON THE BEACH. Man: BIG HAMMERHEAD! GET OUT THE WATER! THE SHARK LAB BELIEVES THAT THE HAMMERHEADS IN BIMINI ARE COMING INTO THE SHALLOWS TO ATTACK PREY, BUT THEY HAVE NEVER CAPTURED VIDEO OF THE PREDATION. Gruber: WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET VIDEO DATA, CLEAR VIDEO PHOTOGRAPHS, OF A GREAT HAMMERHEAD PREYING ON AN EAGLE RAY. WE HOPE THAT THE EAGLE RAY DECOY WILL PRODUCE IN THE GREAT HAMMERHEAD SHARK A FEEDING RESPONSE THAT IS STEP-WISE -- THE APPROACH, THE BITE, THE CONSUMPTION, AND THE RELEASE. Newman: SO WE KNOW THAT THESE HAMMERHEADS ARE EATING RAYS THEN? -YEAH. -HEY, GUYS. -WHEN WE GOT A -- -THERE'S A BIG GIRL RIGHT HERE. -OH, ALREADY! THAT'S INCREDIBLE! -OH, MY GOD. GUYS, GET READY. GET YOUR GEAR ON. Narrator: WITH A HUNGRY SHARK ON THE SCENE, THIS MIGHT BE THE TEAM'S BEST CHANCE TO UNCOVER HOW THESE SHARKS USE SHALLOW WATER TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. ♪♪ USING A SCOOTER, MIKE WILL TOW THE DECOY THROUGH THE WATER TO SIMULATE AN EAGLE RAY ON THE MOVE. MIKE, MIKE, MIKE, CAN YOU HEAR ME? ALL RIGHT. THAT DECOY LOOKS REALLY GOOD. IT'S GLIDING IN THE WATER JUST FINE. UH, WE'RE GONNA KEEP AN EYE ON THE HAMMERHEAD, SEE WHAT IT'S DOING. ♪♪ MIKE PATROLS THE AREA WITH THE DECOY, HOPING TO ATTRACT A HAMMER. BUT IT APPEARS THE SHARK IS NO LONGER NEAR THE BOAT. MIKE, WE DO NOT SEE THE SHARK ANYMORE. THE SHARK LAB USES A DRONE TO LOCATE THE HAMMER FROM ABOVE. THE DRONE IS GOING IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW. Newman: ALL RIGHT. KEEP ME POSTED, GUYS. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW. -CHRIS, YOU SEE IT ANYWHERE? -STILL NOT SEEING IT. Gruber: JACK, ABOUT 100 YARDS OFF THE STERN. SHE'S RIGHT HERE. Massuger: GOT HER. SHE IS RACING IN FROM ABOUT 100 YARDS AWAY. Bolte: ALL RIGHT, MIKE. WE CAN SEE THE SHARK AGAIN. SHE'S COMING RIGHT TOWARDS THE RAY. SHE'S LOOKING REALLY INTERESTED. SHE'S ABOUT 50 YARDS OFF THE PORT SIDE OF OUR BOAT. Narrator: NOW THAT THE SHARK HAS SEEN THE DECOY, THE TEAM HOPES TO WITNESS A HAMMERHEAD PREDATION IN SHALLOW WATER FOR THE FIRST TIME. Newman: HUH? HERE SHE COMES. HERE SHE COMES. ♪♪ MIKE, SHE IS COMING RIGHT ON YOU, RIGHT TOWARDS THE DECOY. WITH THEIR UNIQUE HEAD SHAPE, HAMMERHEADS HAVE AMAZING STEREOSCOPIC VISION, ALLOWING THEM TO SEE ALMOST 360 DEGREES WITH PRECISE DEPTH PERCEPTION. SHE'S SNIFFING AT IT. SHE'S INTERESTED. Bolte: COMING IN HOT. COMING IN HOT TOWARDS THE DECOY. LOOK AT HIM! HE'S RIGHT THERE. I SEE HIM. HE'S COMING OVER. HE'S COMING RIGHT UP HERE! WHEW! THAT WAS CLOSE. ALL RIGHT. SHE'S COMING BACK AT YOU. OH, THE HAMMERHEAD'S GOING RIGHT FOR IT. VERY, VERY GOOD. OH, SHE'S COMING IN! LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT TO BITE IT! OH! SHARK SIGHTED. ONE BEACH, TWO ATTACKS. Reporter: A 10-FOOT GREAT WHITE SHARK RUSHED AT HIM. Narrator: ACROSS THE GLOBE, SHARKS IN SHALLOW WATERS ARE CREATING HEADLINES. Gruber: HAMMERHEADS ARE ADAPTED FOR SHALLOW WATER. THEY'VE EVOLVED IN THAT STATE. AND KNOWING THAT VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEM, IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR CAPABILITIES ARE. IF THE EAGLE RAY DECOY WORKS, I THINK IT CAN OPEN UP A WIDE FIELD OF STUDIES FOR US. LOOK AT HIM! HE'S RIGHT THERE. I SEE HIM. HE'S COMING OVER. HE'S COMING RIGHT UP HERE! Narrator: FOR YEARS, GREAT HAMMERHEADS HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH STINGRAY BARBS IN THEIR MOUTHS. BUT THE SHARK LAB HAS NEVER CAPTURED VIDEO DATA OF THE ACTUAL PREDATION EVENT. Bolte: OH, SHE'S COMING IN. LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT TO BITE IT! OH! ALL RIGHT. SHE JUST MASHED THAT DECOY. SHE IS REALLY AGITATED. -OHH! -OHH! IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S RIGHT ON THE RIGHT WING. -WHOA! -SHE JUST TOOK IT. Newman: SHE'S RIGHT ON TOP OF ME! -NICE! -WHOA! Massuger: BOY, SHE JUST TOO THE WING OFF. BEAUTIFUL! -THAT WAS AWESOME. -YEAH. [ CHUCKLES ] MIKE, HOW ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE? DID YOU SEE THAT? -ALL RIGHT. -ROGER THAT. WELL, WE'LL BE THERE TO GET YOUR STUFF. SOUNDS GOOD, MAN. Narrator: WHEN HUNTING IN THE SHALLOWS, HAMMERHEADS REDUCE VERTICAL SPACE AND GIVE PREY LESS CHANCE TO ESCAPE. THEY'RE WELL ADAPTED TO HUNT AT THIS DEPTH, AND THIS COULD BE A CLUE THAT SHALLOW WATER BEHAVIOR ISN'T NEW. YEAH, MAN. SHE TOOK THAT WING CLEAN OFF. HOLY... Gruber: THE ENTIRE RAY DECOY SEQUENCE WAS ASTOUNDING. FROM OUR OBSERVATIONS, WHEN YOU GO ON THE FLATS AND CHASE AFTER A RAY, THE RAY HAS FAR LESS OF AN ABILITY TO ESCAPE. IF THE PREY DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SWIM 50 FEET UP, THEN 30 FEET DOWN, THEN 40 FEET TO THE SIDE, BUT CAN ONLY SWIM 2 OR 3 FEET UP OR 10 FEET UP, THAT SHARK'S GONNA HAVE A BETTER SHOT. Bolte: STILL GOT EYES WITH THE DRONE. Narrator: BACK IN GUADALUPE, THE GREAT WHITE TEAM IS STRATEGIZING HOW TO TAG THE NEW SHARK THEY'VE JUST SPOTTED. Johnson: THE FIRST STEP OF THIS EXPEDITION IS TO TRY TO GET A TRANSMITTER INTO ONE OF THESE BIG WHITE SHARKS AROUND THE ISLAND. SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BAIT THEM UP TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, AND MAURICIO'S GOING TO USE A POLE SPEAR TO IMPLANT A TRANSMITTER WITHOUT HAVING TO CATCH THE SHARK. Narrator: THE TAG'S GPS LOCATOR WILL ALLOW MAURICIO TO TRACK THE SHARK AS IT SWIMS BETWEEN THE DEEP AND THE SHALLOWS. Hoyos: SO, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TRYING TO SET AN ULTRASONIC TRANSMITTER IN A WHITE SHARK IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THIS SHARK FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S AWESOME. Narrator: MAURICIO AND THE TEAM BELIEVE THAT IF THEY CAN TAG A NEW SHARK AT THE ISLAND, THEY COULD DISCOVER BEHAVIORS UNKNOWN TO SCIENCE UNTIL NOW. ♪♪ THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF TAGGING SHARKS IN DEEPER WATER. AWESOME! WE HAVEN'T GOT A VISUAL YET, BUT WE'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT. THERE'S THE SHARK, BELOW US. THIS SHARK IS ALREADY PART OF MAURICIO'S PROJECT, SO THE TEAM MUST WAIT AND HOPE FOR THE NEW SHARK THEY SPOTTED EARLIER TO REAPPEAR. TO ENSURE MORE SHARKS EMERGE, THEY'RE USING BAIT. IT'S A TRADE-OFF, DRAWING THE GREAT WHITES CLOSE ENOUGH TO TAG. Johnson: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! WOW! RIGHT UNDER US. COMING YOUR SIDE NOW. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! OKAY, THERE IT IS. THIS LARGE MALE IS THE PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR A TAG BECAUSE HE IS A NEW SHARK THAT MAURICIO HAS NEVER I.D.'d BEFORE. HE IS APPROXIMATELY 17 FEET LONG AND WEIGHS WELL OVER A TON. COPY, COPY. OH, THAT IS A BIG SHARK! Hoyos: OKAY, IT'S COMING RIGHT UP TO THE BAIT. IT'S COMING. HERE. IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. HE'S COMING. [ Chuckling ] WHOA! WHOA! Johnson: YEAH! Massyn: OH, THIS IS IT. THIS IS IT. -TAG IT. -READY? EVERYBODY GET BACK NOW! Narrator: SHARK SIGHTINGS IN SHALLOW WATERS HAVE SPARKED RESEARCH PROJECTS ACROSS THE GLOBE. Man: BIG HAMMERHEAD! GET OUT THE WATER! THE GREAT WHITES OF GUADALUPE WERE NORMALLY THOUGHT TO HUNT AT DEPTHS OF 600 TO 1,000 FEET, BUT NEW ULTRASONIC TAGS REVEAL THAT THEY SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME IN JUST 60 FEET OF WATER, CONSIDERED EXTREMELY SHALLOW FOR THE ISLAND. Massyn: OKAY. IT'S COMING RIGHT UP TO THE BAIT. IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. [ Chuckling ] WHOA! WHOA. IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. -YES! -GOT IT! GOT IT! [ LAUGHS ] GOOD STUFF, MAN. RIGHT ON THE SPOT. THAT'S A BIG MALE. WITH THIS TAG, THE TEAM WILL TRACK THE SHARK'S MOVEMENTS AROUND THE ISLAND IN REAL TIME. THE HOPE IS THAT THEY CATCH IT IN THE ACT AS IT MAKES A MOVE FROM THE DEEP INTO THE SHALLOWS. Johnson: THAT WAS A PERFECT SHOT! Narrator: ON THE OPPOSITE COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE SHARK LAB TEAM USES A DRONE TO SEARCH FOR A HAMMERHEAD SHARK WITH THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF DAYLIGHT. Gruber: EARLIER TODAY, WE DID A FEEDING STUDY WITH THE RAY DECOY. AND THE REASON IT WAS AMAZING IS BECAUSE IF I WERE TO PREDICT WHAT THAT HAMMERHEAD WOULD DO, IT DID EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED. NOW, WE'D LIKE TO FOLLOW ONE IN AND SEE IF WE CAN SEE ANY DIFFERENCES IN FEEDING BEHAVIOR BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT. -WHERE'S THE DRONE? -WE'RE ABOUT 150 METERS AWAY. WAIT, LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. YOU SEE HOW QUICK IT'S MOVING THERE? -THAT'S MOVING FAST. -THERE'S A DARKER AREA. -YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY A FISH. -LET'S DROP -- YEAH, NO. -YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY... -THAT'S A HAMMERHEAD. -...THAT THAT'S CHARGING IN. -THAT'S A HAMMERHEAD. HERE HE COMES. HE'S COMING TO US. Gruber: THAT'S A GOOD TURN. THAT'S A DAMN GOOD TURN. Newman: HOW FAR AWAY IS IT? WE'RE 150 METERS IN THAT DIRECTION. CHRIS, LET'S FIRE UP THE BOAT AND SEE IF WE CAN GET IN THAT. -ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET ON HIM. -GO, GO, GO. Narrator: THIS SHARK IS CAPTURED ON THE DRONE IN JUST 6 FEET OF WATER. HAMMERHEADS HUNTING IN THE EXTREME SHALLOWS IS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE SHARK LAB'S RESEARCH BECAUSE A LARGE SHARK RECENTLY MADE HEADLINES WHEN IT WAS CAUGHT RIGHT OFF THE BEACH. Reporter: A GROUP OF YOUNG FISHERMEN IN BOCA RATON, FLORIDA, REELED IN A 14-FOOT HAMMERHEAD SHARK THAT WEIGHED AN ESTIMATED 700 POUNDS. Gruber: THEY MAY COME IN AT DUSK, OR ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT, AND USE VERY, VERY SHALLOW WATERS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. WE'RE JUST NOT THERE TO SEE IT. Massuger: THAT HAMMERHEAD THAT'S COME IN, I CAN SEE IT. IT'S RACING AROUND JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE LIGHT. Narrator: WITH A LARGE HAMMERHEAD NEAR THE BOAT, THE TEAM HAS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY BEHAVIORAL CHANGES AT NIGHT. THEY'LL USE A STINGRAY DECOY AGAIN TO ENTICE THE SHARK. MIKE, MIKE, MIKE, DO YOU COPY? Bolte: TO YOUR LEFT. TO HIS LEFT. TO YOUR LEFT, TO YOUR LEFT, TO YOUR LEFT. Narrator: EAGLE RAYS USE THE SHALLOWS TO REST DURING LOW TIDE, SO MIKE BURIES THE DECOY TO MIMIC THIS BEHAVIOR. Massuger: SHE'S COMING IN FROM THE SHADOWS. SHE'S COMING IN FROM YOUR RIGHT. MIKE, THAT SHARK IS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE LIGHT, JUST RIGHT ALONG THAT EDGE WHERE THE SHADOWS ARE, HEADING TOWARDS YOU FAST. YOU SEE IT? OH, SHE'S COMING IN FAST. SHE'LL BE COMING TOWARDS YOU REAL QUICK, REAL QUICK. YOU SEE ANYTHING? SHE'S STICKING AROUND. SHE'S TURNING QUICK, TURNING QUICK. Narrator: ACROSS THE GLOBE, EACH YEAR BRINGS MORE SIGHTINGS OF LARGE SHARKS IN SHALLOW WATERS. WATCH YOURSELF, GUYS. WATCH YOURSELF. NOW, TWO TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY. AND THEY'RE LEARNING THIS BEHAVIOR MAY NOT BE NEW. Bolte: YOU SEE ANYTHING? SHE'S STICKING AROUND. SHE'S TURNING QUICK, TURNING QUICK. THE HAMMERHEAD MAY RELY MORE ON ITS ELECTROSENSITIVITY WHEN HUNTING AT NIGHT, AND IT MAY HAVE REVEALED TO HER THAT THIS RAY IS ONLY A DECOY. Gruber: THE TURNING RADIUS OF A GREAT HAMMERHEAD SHARK IS SO IMPRESSIVE. YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY HOW AGILE THIS SPECIES IS. IT SWERVES AND TURNS AND CAN STOP ON A DIME. WHEN I SEE THIS TYPE OF SWERVING AND TURNING, I KNOW IT'S IN A HUNTING MODE. Narrator: THE MORE DATA THE SHARK LAB GETS ON HAMMERHEADS IN THE SHALLOWS, THE MORE CLEAR IT IS HOW WELL ADAPTED THESE SHARKS ARE TO SHALLOW WATER. ♪♪ THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, THE GREAT WHITE TEAM IS STARTING TO DRAW A SIMILAR CONCLUSION. Hoyos: YEAH, VERY CLOSE TO THE SHORE. THE FOUR SHARKS TAGGED WITH NEW ULTRASONIC TRANSMITTERS HAVE ALL FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PATTERN. -OH, HERE WE GO! -LET'S DO IT. LEAVING THE DEPTHS TO HANG OUT IN WATER CONSIDERED EXTREMELY SHALLOW FOR GUADALUPE. MAURICIO AND THE TEAM ARE NOW FOLLOWING NEWLY TAGGED MALE. Massyn: THAT FULL MOON IS JUST LIKE A SPOTLIGHT IN THE SKY. YES. THE OCEAN'S JUST LIT UP RIGHT NOW. I BET YOU THEY CAN SEE A LOT OF THINGS UNDER THE WATER. YEAH, I THINK THAT THEY COULD SEE THE SILHOUETTES OF THE SEALS WHEN THEY ARE AT THE SURFACE WHEN THEY ARE UNDERNEATH. OH, THERE WE GO. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. Narrator: THE TEAM LOCKS ON TO A SIGNAL, AND THE SHARK SEEMS TO BE HEADING CLOSER TO SHORE IN JUST 60 FEET OF WATER. -IS THAT A SHARK? -YEAH. THIS WILL BE THE PERFECT SPOT. LET'S GET THE EXPLORER INTO THE WATER AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A SHOT HERE IN THE SHADOWS AT NIGHT. Narrator: USING THE EXPLORER AT NIGHT IS RISKY. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] IN THE DARKNESS, DEVON HAS ONLY SECONDS TO REACT. BUT IF THE TEAM WANTS TO REVEAL WHAT THE SHARKS ARE DOING IN THE SHALLOWS OF GUADALUPE... LET'S BE CAREFUL. LET'S TRY TO AVOID THAT THE EXPLORER DOESN'T BOUNCE A LOT. ...THIS IS THEIR CHANCE. ♪♪ [ DEVICE PINGING ] DEVON, DEVON, DEVON. HOW'S IT LOOKING DOWN THERE? WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SEEING? SCIENTISTS BELIEVE SPOTTING WHITE SHARK HUNTING ACTIVITY IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WOULD BE VERY RARE. OH, OH, OH, OH. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. STAND BY ONE SECOND, DEVON. I HAVE ONE. IT'S GOING TO THE SOUTH. HEY, DEVON. WE'VE GOT A SHARK THAT'S ABOUT 25 METERS DOWN. AND IT'S HEADING TOWARDS THE SOUTH. MAURICIO SAYS THE SHARK IS POSSIBLY... 65. 65 METERS DEEP. NOW, THE SHARK IS LIKE 37 METERS. IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT SHALLOWER NOW. OKAY, LET ME -- TAKE IT. IT SEEMS THAT IT'S GOING RIGHT TO TWIN CANYONS. I CAN SEE YOUR LIGHT. SO MAYBE IT'S VERY CLOSE TO YOU. OVER. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SHARK, THOUGH, ANOTHER ONE. YEAH. I IMAGINE THESE SHARKS ARE IN HUNT MODE RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE PROBABLY USING THIS FULL MOON THE SAME WAY THAT THE SHARKS USE DAYLIGHT. Massyn: THESE SHARKS ARE EVERYWHERE! ANOTHER ONE! ANOTHER ONE! IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE IN HUNT MODE, FOR SURE. DEVON, WE'RE GETTING TWO DIFFERENT TRANSMITTER SIGNALS. SO IF YOU'RE SEEING SHARKS THAT DON'T HAVE TRANSMITTERS, THEN THAT'S EVEN MORE THAN YOU'RE LOOKING AT, THEN. THERE'S PLENTY OF SHARKS STACKING UP DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW. SEVERAL SHARKS DOWN HERE. THIS IS AMAZING. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. THE SHARKS ARE MOVING INTO SHALLOWER WATER AT NIGHT USING THE FULL MOON TO HUNT, IT SEEMS. IT'S AMAZING TO SEE. ♪♪ Narrator: THE TEAM CAPTURES VIDEO DATA OF WHITE SHARKS AGGREGATING IN SHALLOW WATERS. Hoyos: IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE ARE GATHERING ALL THE PIECES FROM THE PUZZLE. WE ARE GETTING TO KNOW A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THIS ANIMAL AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM. Johnson: THEY CAN ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THEY CAN DEVELOP NEW STRATEGIES DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL PREY ITEMS. THESE SHARKS ARE USING THE CLEAR WATER AND THE EXTRA LIGHT OF THE FULL MOON TO MOVE INTO SHALLOWER DEPTHS AND HUNT THEIR PREY ITEMS THERE. SHARKS HAVE BEEN OCCUPYING SHALLOW WATER AND FEEDING FOR THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF YEARS. BUT THESE DAYS, WE ARE NOW SEEING IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TECHNIQUES TO PHOTOGRAPH AND SPREAD THE INFORMATION. AND THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE. WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEM NOW. Narrator: WHILE MANY BEHAVIORS OF GREAT WHITES AND HAMMERHEADS REMAIN A MYSTERY, ONE THING IS CLEAR -- THIS SHALLOW WATER INVASION HAS BEEN HAPPENING ALONGSIDE HUMANS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS... -OHH! -OHH! ...AND SCIENCE IS JUST STARTING TO CRACK THE CODE.
