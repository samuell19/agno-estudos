[heavy breathing] Ok, today's my birthday. Look. My mom gave me this present, ok? She died in January, I just wanted it back. Please. Oh, don't look at us. Donny's the one who stole it. Oh c'mon! I'm trying to do what's right! Real classy, guys. Ok! You know what? Enough of this crap! I'm taking the kids and we're leaving! Let's go! They're not going anywhere with you bub. Oh really? Yeah, really. Stay back. Oh yeah, and Ped go ahead. [yelling] [punching and grunting] Hey you, you missed my call again. I just wanted to say, I know tonight was hard, and that's ok. Who knows? Maybe something good can still come of it. ♪ [low droning music starts] ♪ I love you. We love you. I'll see you soon. ♪ [music builds] ♪ [car trunk slams shut] [heavy breathing] You came back? Well, yeah! [laughs] Are we not being held hostage by drug lords anymore? No. [laughs] I don't think we're gonna be seeing much of them anymore. [heavy breathing] You saved my life. Even though I... yelled at you. Sorry about that. Yeah... I guess we did. It might be the severe head trauma talking, but... I don't know if I should press charges for the whole, "hitting me with your car, - tasing me five times" -- - Look If there's anyone to blame, blame me. I'm the reason why they're here. Uh? What were we talking about? Alright, how about I take these two home, and I take you to the hospital? Yeah... ok yeah. Where's my bike? Just take me to my bike. Alright man. Whatever you say. Watch your head. [car engine starts] [car shuts off] Hey, and um... and again... I'm sorry about all this. All this. Just... let me know if there's anything I can do. Thanks. Hey! Um...
