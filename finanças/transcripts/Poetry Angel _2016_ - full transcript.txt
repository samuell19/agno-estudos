Once they drink, it's all over. A number of crop-stealing cases have occurred over the past week. This is horrible news. What a terrible country it's become. They've never had a job, never worked. Leave him alone for once. He's disturbing the neighbors. We're surrounded by fields! Illusion is the root of all poetry. Not the reality we face in daily life. An expression of illusion and delusion. Is that clear? Then let's try it. Okay, Tamaki. You go first. Illusion, okay? Create an illusion. My hand Is a weed-whacker, my strength Held high, it attracts a vast audience Any girl watching Is in love She approaches, 1 hold her tight My weed-whacker cuts deep into her body Splendid! I didn't expect such a depth of talent. Our very own Edward Scissor-Hands! Hey, Hayashi! Come on, what's that you're writing? It's the schedule for a team competition. We're having a team competition? Yes, a contest. Did you know about this? No, I've heard nothing. No one told us. Didn't I mention it? Who's the competition? The very prestigious Haruyama West High School. Competing against schoolkids? Get real! We're all past puberty. They don't even have pubic hair. 1 think they do. So many fresh, young, schoolgirls to look forward to. You go do it yourself. 1 guess I'll just have to cancel the gig. Let's do it! No, I meant... It's better to compete. To gain some experience. Doi is running late. He wasn't keen in the first place. But I hope he turns up. Are you nervous? No, not at all. The best antidote to nervousness is salty plums. They produce saliva and relax the parasympathetic nerve. No, I'm okay. Look, here's Doi. Doi, over here! He looks eager enough. Hello there. Thanks for coming today. Our pleasure. Will you box poetic, too? No, I'm here to supervise them. Really? Must be a tough job. And thank City Hall for sponsoring this project. To publicize our city. A tuxedo? How very fetching.

And now it's the Angels versus the Poemers. Starting with Hayashi the Pretender. Watch and learn. Good luck. Seriously? My Dream I want delicious food every day And to go to university Is that all? No, a husband and two beautiful children to take to Disneyland Disneysea, too! And spaghetti carbonara With lots of salad and green perilla dressing There's more? Yes, because my dreams have no end Time for our judges to pick a winner. Miss Fujimori, it's unanimous. Congratulations. I'm so sorry. So terribly sorry. Hayashi, come back. Sorry, a bathroom break. Peter Piper prodigiously picked a peck of pickled peppers So how many peppers did our pal Piper pick? 1 ain't finished yet! Give me that microphone. That's a non-original work, you're disqualified. It's all over! Angels win by default. What the hell was that? Back to your seat, please. I need a friend That's all. My opponent attacks He has me pinned down He's as heavy as a rhinoceros You'll have to piggy-back me away from here Carry me on your back from now on Miss Yasuoka wins. A summer weed asks a morning glory to play together No way” Replies the morning glory "Cant you two just get along?” asks the sun Two senior citizens sitting listening to them As they think about their grandchildren The sun shines down on the morning glory and summer weeds An old wife and husband it on an old porch Subtly distant, such a beautiful scene 1 wonder what they will bring us tomorrow? 1 strongly urge you Watch me on rainy days and when the sun sets red Hide yourself in the shadows behind me For I will continue talking until the very end Your votes, please. Jinjiro wins. My hand Is a weed-whacker, my strength Held high, it attracts a vast audience Any girl watching Is in love She approaches, 1 hold her tight My weed-whacker cuts deep into her body It was my decision to make To create my own colorful story 1 decide when it starts And when it ends And I decide whether to believe it or not I'm the one growing into adulthood Miss Matsushima wins. With a score of 401 the Angels are the winners. We did it! Hey, Hayashi! Why the hell did you run away? Have you been crying? Damn it! I was pitiful I'm supposed to be your coach. I cant take it. Is everything okay with you? I'm fine. We'll win next time. Maruyama. You're up. Okay, come out boxing. Okay, stop. Go to a neutral corner. Stop there. Are you okay? See what you can do when you try? Not much of an opponent, though. Concentrate and keep working on your technique. From below. That's it. Why didn't you do that with her? Don't let yourself get distracted. Good morning, Maruyama. I hear you've taken up boxing. Me, too. Poetry Boxing. Come, it's a good chance for you to change. Come and watch a session. We meet Mondays, Thursdays and Friday afternoons. Leave me alone. Where's Tsutomu? Leave him be. What's going on? I'm taking a nap. I heard about your poetry contest. It was embarrassing. Wake up, eat breakfast, cut weeds. Then sleep, eat, cut weeds and sleep again. Is that a future? Cut weeds, grow plums, put them in brine the dry them in the sun. One step at a time. And I hate it! That's your job. What about my dreams? Are there dreams in poetry? What a great life. Will Tamaki be okay? 1 think he's just in shock. 1 worry about Tamaki, he seems so fragile. Tamaki is so... I'm sick of hearing you repeat his name. -You're in love! -I'm not. Shall we start without him? Shall we? Why do you think we lost? Great poetry flies out of the ring. We need more desperation. Your poems all lacked any emotional appeal Not enough passion. Poetry is an extension of our daily lives. You should talk. Pretending to be another! Let's do it! Hey, Tamaki. You gave me a fright. Your mom said I could come up. We've come up with a new training routine. We observe someone's daily activities. Then assume that persona when writing our poetry. Listen. I picked you to train with. So I'm here to observe you. It's my day off. 1 usually just sleep. Then let me watch you sleep. I'm Jinjiro Nakajima. 1 do Poetry Boxing with your son. Oh, thank you. As part of my training, I'm here to observe him. Observe his daily life? But he does nothing. Finish off that patch today. Have you made salty plums? No, I have an orange orchard. Is that right? The field you saw earlier. I made him plant plum there. Then left them for him to tend. I thought if he raised them himself, he'd change and start to love them. They smell great. Then we sort them. Separate into good and bad. You have so many curing here. This is our family treasure. Jinjiro. I'll take my break. So what now, Millennial? Your dad's given you a month to make your choice. Between the orchard, or your poetry. 1 trust you'll get it right. Which one's right? You talked to my dad? Is that a problem? Not really. He did say something. Salty plums made in the traditional fashion never go bad. He doesn't want you to go bad. That's not even funny. You should come around to my place. You're obviously uncomfortable here at home. See you. Morning glory and summer weeds fill the garden -The sun shines down... Hello. It's Tamaki. You actually came. Good. 1 was just working on my poem. My wife, Tsune. Hello, I'm Tamaki. Thank you for befriending the elderly. No, it's my pleasure. Her vision is not what it was. So what we do is sit here like this. And I describe what I see to her. Well? Well what? Will you recite your poem for us? Actually, I quite like your poem. My weed-whacker cuts deep into her body Sorry. You probably don't get it. Jinjiro's Dally Life: My eyes as a digital camera Training to Become Training to Become Doi observed my daily routine. A glimpse into Hayashi's daily life He works at City Hall Citizens come to complain Why are you wasting our taxes? Tax? Your tax? Tax, tax, lax Racks of taxes stacked Complaints as strong as steel Rain down on him Hayashi means forest But don't cut this tree! Don't cut them down Don't cut him down Show love for the forest He's not really a rapper He works as a waiter at a girlie-club Girls, customer at table 4 Today, yet again We hear his feeble voice Mic in hand Seating customers That's his only performance A girlie-bar? You're not a rapper? He dwells in the plum orchard Trees choked by early summer weeds And the weeds themselves begging for a trim But this lad says he hates trimming weeds I'm so creative, he says I deserve more attention The weeds doubt he can write at all Shut up, or I cut you!” He responds Taking up his tool He begins to cut And all the weeds are gone Leaving a lush field of green 1 see a prosperous future growing on the plum trees My eyes are like a digital camera 1 capture my garden with my digital camera Sorry. That's all I've got. Tamaki, don't look so blue. Come on, you were doing well Don't sweat it. What about you, Hayashi? You monitored Itaya, right? Are you always like that? Sometimes. Thank you. That's it? No poem? That marks the end of this training exercise. Now you're naked, no fakery or lies. Your poems will soar. That is poetry! Will you let pubic-hairless little girls beat you? We shall take revenge on Haruyama West High! Jinjiro! Are you okay? Dad, quick! Jinjiro's hurt. Hurry! What happened? Dad! Quick! Honjo Memorial Hospital He twisted his back carrying plums. He just needs bed rest. That's not the problem. Why did you make him work? You put him in hospital Now he can't compete. He's the anchor of our team. You always screw up everything I try to do. I'm so sorry. No need to apologize. Does it hurt? Don't move. Listen. 1 asked him to put me to work. Don't blame it on your father. So he won't be fit for the next match? Listen Hayashi. That means we're one short. It's my fault. I'm sorry. You're not to blame, Tamaki. Come on Tamaki, cheer up. The thing about you, Tamaki... 1 get sick of hearing you always yelling his name. You're in love! That's sick! You're wrong, Admit it. What are you saying? All I'm doing is encouraging him. You just keep repeating his name. At least 2,000 times. -Only 5 times. -Who's counting? Our granddaughter, An. She rarely smiles, she's not talkative, but don't hold It against her. No, that's fine. What brings you here today? My weed-whacker cuts deep into her body He's so funny, isn't he? Sorry, Tsune. I'd better head back You're leaving already? My weed-whacker cuts deep into her body Please seize my weed-whacker from me God, please seize the weeds from me I'm still boxing. And I go running every day. Really? That's very good. And school... I really like school That's wonderful, dear. I left my bicycle key behind. What were you doing over there? So you run every day? Why did you lie about enjoying school? Leave me alone. That sulky face tells everyone just exactly how you feel Don't walk away. I'm... I'm sorry. Do me a favor. Can we think of anyone? One guy said he'd come if we pay him. Of course we won't pay. 1 found a new member. Seriously? 1 knew you could do it, Tamaki. It's Jinjiro's grandchild. Jinjiro has grandchildren? At his age, it's not unrealistic. Come in. She's our very own poetry angel 1 hold her tight My weed-whacker cuts deep into her body Take my weed-whacker from me! My Grandma... My Grandma is always smiling The next match is tomorrow. Are you nervous? Eat salty plums if you're nervous. They produce saliva and ease the parasympathetic nerve. You should try them. Don't worry. I'm more worried than you. No, not her! What's wrong? We've been robbed. They took our treasure. Dad. Is there something... Anything I can do? You've got a match on today. Get in the truck. Dad., it's not the time... 1 turn 22 this year. -I've decided. -Poetry. Do you love poetry? 1 do. I see. What a wonderful life. Sorry. Only adults can show them true childishness. Let's show them today. We have our own poetry angel! Don't embarrass me. No, not you. Get real He means her. Apologize. Apologize to us all. Are you nervous? No, but we're on soon, 50 be serious.
