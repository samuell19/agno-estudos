[♪♪♪] [WHOOSHING] ALMAN [VOICE-OVER]: In days of legend, gods walked the Earth and tormented mortals. Athena, goddess of warfare and wisdom, had the power to destroy humanity but chose to protect us. Brave young knights from across the globe swore their allegiance to her. They learned to harness Cosmo, the power of the stars. Their fists cracked the heavens in battles against those who wished Athena dead. Over time... [YELLS] ...the gods retreated and became myths. But then, 18 years ago, Athena was reborn as a helpless child. A knight clad in gold armor gave his life to protect her as they crashed to Earth. And that's how I found her, lying in his arms. A mortal girl with the power of a god. Since then, I've been searching for a new generation of knights to protect Athena and the Earth. PATRICIA [VOICE-OVER]: We fight to protect ourselves. [♪♪♪] But we also fight to protect each other. [FAINT, ECHOING LAUGHTER] There's always something bigger than you, Seiya. You'll have to fight to protect that, as well. [GROANS] You give up? YOUNG SEIYA [VOICE-OVER]: Never! Nice try, but not tonight. Tap out. No! You must learn when to quit. [GROANS] Never! [BREATHING HEAVILY] No, Seiya. Don't! [PATRICIA'S VOICE ECHOING] Promise you won't come out. I promise. [SCREAMS] [QUIET CHATTER] [LIVELY CHATTER, SHOUTING IN DISTANCE] Hey, kid. Come on, you're up next. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER] [LIVELY CHATTER, SHOUTING] [FIGHTER YELLS] Hey, you win this fight, maybe you get a shot at me someday. Hey. Listen to me. No more of that dancing around, you understand? You make it a good show this time. [SCOFFS] Man. Fight this time, asshole. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the main event. Introducing first, the undisputed champion of the octagon. Give it up for Jaki The Beast! [YELLS] CROWD [CHANTING]: Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! Jaki! And the contender, who literally danced his way through his first two fights, let's hear it for Street Kid Seiya! [CROWD BOOING] REFEREE: You both know how this works. You know the rules. There are none. Anything goes until one of you gives up or blacks out. If you give up, you're banished from the octagon. Understood? [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] Damn it, fight! Hey, I said no dancing! [BOOING] [GROANS] [BOOING CONTINUES] [GRUNTS] [CROWD CHEERING] [CHANTING]: Cassios! Cassios! What, you think you can just ignore me? Okay, calm down, big guy. [JAKI GRUNTING ANGRILY] [GRUNTS VICIOUSLY] [GROANS] Ballet's over, kid. [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [♪♪♪] [JOINTS CRACKING] Cassios wins... every single time! [YELLS] [CROWD CHEERING] [YELLS] Cassios! Cassios! Cassios! Cassios! Cassios! Cassios! Cassios! [YELLS] [MUFFLED SHOUTING] [EARS RINGING] [♪♪♪] [DISTORTED, HEAVY BREATHING] CROWD: Cassios! Cassios! Cassios! [GRUNTING] You give up? [SCREAMS] [YELLS] [CROWD GASPING] [GRUNTING SOFTLY] [PANTING] Yeah! [CROWD CHEERING] [PAINED GRUNTING] You don't know when to quit, huh? Yeah, I've heard that before. [YELLS] [GRUNTING] CASSIOS: We're not done here! [LIVELY CHATTER] CASSIOS: This ain't over! [GRUNTS] Come outside. You're cute, but you're not my type, man. There's someone outside that wants to speak with you. He knows about your search. He knows what you're looking for. [♪♪♪] Give me that. [LINE RINGING] Yeah, it's me. I think I found one of your Cosmo guys. [WATER DRIPPING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] I'm out of here. ALMAN: Your little show in there made some people upset. Look, I'm not looking for trouble. You may not be looking, but you've found it. In a few moments, Vander Guraad will be here with her boys. Who? My ex-wife. She controls this fighting ring. It's her recruitment operation. [CHUCKLES] What do you mean? What does she recruit? Warriors with special skills, for her private army. Okay. I saw what you did in the ring. I knew it had to be you, Seiya. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Who are you? [CHUCKLES] I'm the only friend you have. [ENGINE WHIRRING ABOVE] You need to make a choice, Seiya. Come with me, or try your luck against Guraad's warriors. [♪♪♪] Lead the way. [NECK CRACKS] Come on. [GRUNTS] Look what we found. [♪♪♪] What are those guys made of? You don't want to know. Keep moving. [♪♪♪] Our ride's around the corner. Get down! [GUN BLASTS] [DISTORTED GRUNTING] [GUN BLASTS] [GRUNTS] Go! ALMAN: Meet Mylock, my assistant. Those guys work for your ex-wife? [ENGINE STARTS] GURAAD [OVER SPEAKER]: Surrender the boy. [ENGINE REVVING] SEIYA: Dude, you got to make better life choices. [RAPID GUNFIRE] What the hell is that thing? Hope you had a light dinner. [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] Why are they after me? They're after warriors with a strong Cosmo. Cosmo? Is that a new martial arts or something? ALMAN: Well, you should know. You tapped into it in the octagon. I didn't tap into anything. They got the wrong guy. Oh, would you like us to stop and let them know? [PANTING, GASPING] [GRUNTING] God! [♪♪♪] Hold on tight. [TIRES SQUEALING] [LOCK BEEPS, CLICKS] I am not going another step until you tell me what's going on. There'll be time for that later. We're still in danger. You're really... [GRUNTS] [DEVICE CRACKLES] [GROANS] PATRICIA [ECHOING]: Okay. Go to sleep. [♪♪♪] [ENGINE WHIRRING OUTSIDE] Hey. Hey, wake up. Wake up. [RUMBLING] Wake up. Come on. You need to hide. No matter what happens, you stay out of sight. I have to make sure these people don't find you. Promise you won't come out. [MEN SHOUTING OUTSIDE] Okay. I promise. [SCREAMS] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [MUFFLED SHOUTING] [PATRICIA GASPS] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [TREMBLING BREATHS] GURAAD: Thank you. PATRICIA: For what? GURAAD: You tapped into your Cosmo. PATRICIA: No, Seiya. Don't! [SCREAMS] GURAAD [VOICE-OVER]: Led me right to your doorstep. Saved me so much trouble. Let's go! [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] PATRICIA: You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can. GURAAD: That's why you're coming with us. [ENGINE WHIRRING OUTSIDE] [GRUNTS, GROANS] Relax. Relax, we're safe now. Safe? First, I got attacked by ninja cyborgs, then I got a spaceship shooting at me, and then that freak in a suit drugs me! Allow me to rephrase it. You're safer here than with Guraad. She has already captured many kids like you, drained them of their Cosmo. Stop talking nonsense and tell me what's going on! Prepare for landing. SEIYA: What? You might want to buckle up. No, I want answers now! [RUMBLING] Oh, sh...! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! There's no runway! [GRUNTING] I said you might want to buckle up. [SEAT BELT CLICKS] You couldn't just tell me this thing lands vertically? Let's start afresh, shall we? My name is Alman Kido. Once upon a time, I was a businessman. Mylock, let her know our guest has arrived, please. Yes, sir. Should I believe you went bust? I won't hide the fact that I've been quite successful in my trade, but the one thing money can't buy is purpose. So this is where you store your purpose? Yes. Tell me, Seiya, what do you see? Um, I'm not sure. A... A whole bunch of real old stuff, I guess. I see stories. Ancient heroes were defined by their monumental deeds as much as by their tragic ends. I always admired the formidable magnitude of their fate. I envied it. I used to think the ancient lore held no secret for me, but... I'm afraid that was my hubris. What do you know about Athena? SEIYA: She was a god of war. ALMAN: And wisdom. What if I told you Athena had returned in human form and you are destined to become one of her guardian knights? I'd say your therapist isn't worth his paycheck. [CHUCKLES] Things happen for a reason, Seiya. Your Cosmo brought you here. Actually, I was brought here on a very expensive aircraft, and now I'm leaving on my own two feet. You know the truth in your heart, Seiya. Your sister knew it, too. [♪♪♪] What do you know about my sister? Ten years ago, Guraad detected a strong Cosmo at your location. She thought it was Patricia. What did she do to her? I don't know, but your sister gave herself up so that Guraad wouldn't find you. She knew what you were to become: a warrior of Athena, the Pegasus Knight. The Pegasus Knight? You're really out of your mind. Hmm. That doesn't bode well. ALMAN: This is Sienna. Guraad is after her, too. Your mission is to protect her. I can take care of myself. Why would I ever want to risk my neck to protect some rich girl? [SCOFFS] Because our little Sienna here is the reincarnation of the goddess Athena. Dad. Darling, don't you have something for our guest? Sure, a toilet, so he can flush himself out. [LAUGHS] Wow, spoken like a true goddess. Dad, come on. This moron can't seriously be the Pegasus Knight. Go on. Fine. ALMAN: You might recognize this, Seiya. [♪♪♪] This is Patricia's. That is the key to the Pegasus armor. Without it, you don't stand a chance against Guraad's army. I could've handled those guys. That's not what Mylock said. SEIYA: So, how's this supposed to help me find my sister? You give me a little present and expect me to help you out? My plan is to trust you to do what is right. And what would that be? I suppose you've never heard of Marin, the Silver Knight. God, another one of your old legends? Marin can teach you how to reveal the hidden secret of the pendant so you can protect Sienna and yourself against your enemies and maybe even help you find your sister. Ancient gods, magic knights. Do you have any idea how totally insane you sound? I know, it is a lot to take in, isn't it? So, why don't we have breakfast, take the day off and, uh, revisit this tomorrow? Yeah. Well, I am hungry, but, um... A goddess's fate is on the line, but sure, let's eat pancakes. Yeah. [HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING] Get off my ring, you scum. Get out of my ring. You moron. You were supposed to keep a low profile. And I did. We need to shut this place down. You don't get to decide that. That's right. I do. Guraad, come on. We have a great partnership. Yes, we did. How's the boy's Cosmo? It's legit. GURAAD: Good news. I've got a new deal for you. No ring, no deal. All the better. Nobody needs a loser who gets his ass kicked by a scrawny little kid. He got a lucky break. Mm. No man gets lucky twice with Cassios. I can beat anyone, anytime. Yeah, well, let's see if that's true. [GRUNTING] Something wrong? I just don't know how you can breathe while you're eating like that. Where I come from, you eat as much as you can, when you can. You never know where your next meal's coming from. Oh. You wouldn't understand. Rich girl. No, I wouldn't. But I'm sorry you had to live like that. Sir, there's an urgent call. Please excuse me. [CLEARS THROAT] [DOOR CLOSES] So, uh... ...how does it feel to be a goddess? Well, I'm not a goddess yet-- just Sienna-- but her Cosmo is getting stronger by the day, and someday soon, I will become Athena. Most people would be excited to have breakfast with a future goddess. Hmm. Guess I'm not most people, then. Well, then maybe you should... [RUMBLING] Maybe I should what? [SHUDDERING BREATHS] You should back off. Geez, don't be so sensitive. [DISHES RATTLING] Just-just get away from me, okay? Okay, I'm sorry if I... Just get away! [GRUNTS] [WHOOSHING] [GROANS] [FAINT SCREAMING] [YELLS] SEIYA: Hey. Dad! Hey! Are you okay? Wait! [SIENNA WHIMPERING] [PAINED GRUNTING] SEIYA: What's going on? She could kill you right now. I'm here, sweetheart. Just relax. [SIENNA BREATHING HEAVILY] What just happened? She bears a goddess's Cosmo in the body of a mortal. When our sensors detect a potential Cosmo burst, the building automatically blocks the signal. It's the only way we can keep Sienna hidden from Guraad. Which is why I am stuck here like a prisoner. Excuse me. SEIYA: Wait. Wait, so... so you really are... [GRUNTING] Do you really think this guy could beat the Pegasus Knight? Perhaps. If we give him the prototype. [STRAINING] Next candidate? Giving up already? [GRUNTING] [PANTING] What the hell are you made of? Disengage. We ain't done yet. [GRUNTS] You made your point, Cassios. You're a strong man. But you're just a man. I have a problem. You met him in your ring. The kid? His power's a liability. Once he learns to control it, no living man will be able to stop him. What, you think I could, though, hmm? You know, with your, uh, prototype thing? I have a good ear. So, what's your price? That depends. Can I kill him? That's kind of the point. I'll do it for free. [BIRDS SCREECHING] [♪♪♪] You all right? I'm better. You? I-I'm good, I guess. It's just that I can't believe you really are a... A goddess? I'm never gonna call you that. That's fine with me. So, how do people usually react when they learn you're Athena? Varies. Like, the day after I was born, someone tried to kill me. No. Not even you could annoy someone that much in just one day. I was told a knight in gold armor gave his life to save mine. When they found him, he was still holding me in his arms. Who found you? Alman? And Guraad. Though she was a little more into the gold armor. Used it to develop technology far beyond anything you could imagine. Look at the bright side. Half your foster family was great. When Alman's around you, he almost looks like a real dad. [LAUGHS] Alman is my dad, and I love him more than anything in the world. I know that might be hard for you to understand, street boy. I do. I had someone like that once. Your sister? What was she like? She was kind. And strong. And protected me when I couldn't protect myself. And you won't stop until you find her. You really don't care that I've become your bodyguard, do you? I will someday become Athena. I don't have a choice. But that doesn't mean you have to become the Pegasus Knight. Alman said it's my destiny. Nobody's destiny is written in stone. Except yours. Your Cosmo bursts-- do they come with visions? You have visions, too? What does it matter? Cosmo visions are a window into the universe. They can show us things. So, that Silver Knight your dad mentioned... Who, Marin? Marin. Do you think, if he could teach me to control my Cosmo, I could use it to find my sister? Maybe. If that's what you want. [♪♪♪] [PAINED GRUNTING] [GRUNTING STOPS] He's drained of Cosmo, Guraad. Won't get another dose. The prototype procedure has started. It'll be ready tomorrow. GURAAD: Any issues? NERO: Just one. Why Cassios? Because you failed. You know, the target was assisted by Alman Kido. A personal bad penny. Athena's growing stronger by the day, and now she'll have the Pegasus Knight by her side. I reckon the boy's got some Cosmo. Doesn't mean he's a knight yet. I don't need cold comfort, Nero. I need to know where on Earth Alman is hiding the girl so we can neutralize her before she becomes Athena and destroys the world. Beats me. But you could always ask our prisoner. GURAAD: We have a prisoner? [PAINED GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] Hey! Hey, wait up. Yeah? I... I just figured you could focus more on your training if you weren't worried about where your next meal was coming from. Thanks. Thank you. I guess. Mm-hmm. MYLOCK: Seiya! Time to go. See you. MYLOCK: Take a seat. [DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT] Don't get any big ideas. Goddesses don't have boyfriends. How many dads does Sienna have? Buckle up. [ENGINE WHIRRING] Lunch box? That's unusually kind of you. I just thought he might as well enjoy his last meal, since Marin's probably gonna kill him anyway. Right. [♪♪♪] [AIRCRAFT RATTLING] S-So, where am I supposed to go? Okay, just drop me off up there. Not how it works. [♪♪♪] [THUNDER CRASHING] [GRUNTING] [STRAINING]: Those who seek the master must do so on foot. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [THUNDER CRASHING] [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [STRAINED GRUNTING] What the hell am I doing here? I was wondering the same thing. [GRUNTING WITH EFFORT] You must be Marin, the Silver Knight. You look surprised. Yeah. No, I... I mean... No offense, I thought you'd be a man. No offense taken. I thought the same of you. Ouch. So, what's the training schedule like here? I only train knights. I'm told I'm the Pegasus Knight. You're not the first boy with a pretty necklace to show up here. Is there a test I can take or something? The Pegasus Knight is brave. [CHUCKLES] Check. Humble. Check. And committed to protecting Athena with his life. Okay, that's where this, uh, whole situation gets a little sticky. You see, I lost my sister... Hey! I just got up here! Just... I just got up here. I'm not going down there. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [RUMBLING] There's nothing for you here. Oh! What are you, like, a ninja? Listen, I only want to find my sister. Sienna said you could help. I knew a knight just like you. He desired power for his own goals. Which was? The Phoenix, the most powerful of Athena's knights. You mean aside from the Pegasus Knight? Oh, sh... I'll have Mylock come get you in the morning. No. Come on, I made it this far. And how far is that? Do you even know how far you need to go? Just give me one chance. Hmm. If you can break this rock, then you can be my student. Fair enough. Where's the hammer? Come on, I can't break a rock with my bare hands. A knight could. You can't be serious. You're serious. [GROANING SIGH] [GRUNTS] Ow! [GROANS] I told you this was stupid. [GROANS] Your flesh, this rock, the stars in the sky-- all things in the cosmos are made from the same atoms. From the moment we are born, we all hold a Cosmo within ourselves. A knight can make it explode and shatter the atoms of any object. How's that supposed to make any sense? Focus. Clear your mind. Feel the Cosmo within you. [♪♪♪] [TAKES DEEP BREATH] [WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] PATRICIA: Seiya! [GRUNTS] [GROANING] This is stupid. It'll never work. Something clouded your focus at the last minute. Figures. Guess I'm not the Pegasus Knight after all. No, you're not, but maybe you will be. Are you ready to start your training? [♪♪♪] GURAAD: It's a good thing he didn't mind the permanent changes to his body. Well... What? I might have forgotten to mention the permanent part to him. [GRUNTING] [MASK SPLASHES] [GRUNTS] What the hell is this? What did you do? You... You made me a freaking cyborg. [GRUNTING] [WHIRRING] What is that? GURAAD: It's the curse of Athena. The war that awaits us is unlike any other before. Our enemies are the gods themselves. We've all made sacrifices. But what is flesh in comparison to the power to crush the immortals? [BREATHING HEAVILY] A war with the gods, huh? There's only one person I want to crush. Well, that was a nice little show. Let's move on. We have bigger issues at hand. Bigger than his ego? Your prisoner. He's a tough one. I can't get him to talk. Any ideas? Have you tried asking nicely? [RUMBLING] MARIN: Let's get a baseline. [WIND WHISTLING] Show me what you know. You mean fight you? Now? [GRUNTS] [WIND WHOOSHING] [♪♪♪] You came here to train, yes? Is dancing all you can do? [GRUNTING] [RUMBLING] [WIND HOWLING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] Shouldn't I have a weapon or something? Athena's knights wield no weapon. That sucks. [GRUNTING] [STRAINING] [GRUNTING] [EXPLOSIVE WHOOSHING] [GRUNTS] [GROANING]: Okay, I felt that one. It wasn't a direct hit. How the hell'd you do that? You want a weapon? Your Cosmo is your weapon. Focus your energy. Let it burn inside of you. Release it all at once like a shooting star. Felt more like a meteor shower to me. So, do I get to learn this meteor fist of yours? You must, if you want to survive the battles that await you. [♪♪♪] [CRACKLING, WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [SCREAMING] [EXPLOSIVE WHOOSHING] [GASPS] [SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] Sienna! [SIENNA GASPING] It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I'm here. It's all right. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I had another vision. A bad one. It's okay. It's all gone now. Dad... how can you be so sure I'll grow up to protect the world? You are the goddess of wisdom, remember? And warfare. And you're my baby girl. The most loving and stubborn. Nothing could stop you from doing what's right. What did you see? People burning. Cities in ruins. Everything... destroyed. We won't let that happen, will we? You don't understand. It was Athena. She was doing it. I... I was doing it. The visions are just possibilities. Dad, I know you'd let the world burn to keep me safe, but what if that's not me anymore? [SIGHS] [PUNCHES WHOOSHING] [SEIYA PANTING, GRUNTING] Prove to me you're worthy. Focus. [PAINED GRUNTING] Is that all you've got? Your body is here, but your mind is elsewhere. [♪♪♪] [TAKES DEEP BREATH] PATRICIA [VOICE-OVER]: Seiya. There are so many things I need to tell you. I'm here to protect you. Now stop my attack. [ROCKS WHOOSHING] [GRUNTS, GROANS] You're failing. YOUNG SEIYA: Was he a knight, too? The Pegasus? MARIN: Mind and body must become one. [SHARP, RHYTHMIC BREATHING] MARIN: A knight's power comes from within. [GRUNTS] [GROANS] You give up? MARIN: If you can't do this, you'll never be a knight. [ROCKS WHOOSHING] [GRUNTING] You give up? [GROANING] [GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] How did you say you ended up here again? I didn't say, and it's none of your... Right, I'm not... I'm not supposed to know. I know. My destiny is bound to this island. That sounds like a lonely existence. But not one without purpose. You know, I... I have a purpose, too: to find my sister. A knight should not mistake obsession for purpose. I know there is pain in your past, but beyond that pain, there lies your strength. Find it, and the armor will accept you. This is what your sister would have wanted. Get some sleep. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [WIND HOWLING] [♪♪♪] [ROCKS WHOOSHING] [♪♪♪] [BOTH GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [DOOR CLUNKS, CREAKS] [SPITS] I get it. You're tough. You know, someone once taught me that all men, no matter how tough, have something they fear. [GRUNTS, GROWLS] [CHAINS CLINKING] I wonder what it is a big man like you fears the most. [GROANS] [WIND WHISTLING] [WHIRRING] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] Who are you? [HISSING] NERO: You have no idea what I'm capable of. [CREATURE SNARLING] Make-make... make it stop. Make it stop! Make it go away. Now... would you mind telling me where I can find Alman Kido? [CREATURE HISSES] Make it stop! [SCREAMING] This one's bigger than the last one. And your Cosmo is stronger. Now show me what you've learned. [♪♪♪] [TAKES DEEP BREATH] [WHIRRING] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] You did it, Seiya. The Pegasus armor is... [GROANING] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [GROANING CONTINUES] PATRICIA: You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can. That's why you're coming with us. [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING CONTINUES] [RINGING FADES] Alman. He was a part of it. He was there when Guraad took Patricia. I want off this island. [WHOOSHING] You are not ready. Your training is not over. It is now. [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] This whole time, Alman has been playing me for a fool. MARIN: You must calm down. If your heart and mind aren't clear, the armor will reject you. To hell with the armor! [WHIRRING] [WHOOSHING] [SEIYA GROANS] Seiya. SEIYA: I don't care. You can either kill me now... ...or send me back. [♪♪♪] CASSIOS: Let's go. One more round, guys. [PUNCHES THUMPING] Come on. [GRUNTING] How's it coming along? [CASSIOS CONTINUES GRUNTING] You want this to work, I need more time. Be careful, you idiot! [PANTING] Yeah, running out of sparring partners. You care to join? Oh, I'm sorry. Busy day. Ah. Right, right. You're, uh, playing with your, uh, god-killing toy over here. Yeah. So much trouble for one little girl. You know, you ask me, I'd be more than happy to snap her neck the old-fashioned way. Any damage to Sienna's body might awaken Athena's Cosmo within her. Yeah, I-I don't even know what that means. It means you can't dismantle a nuclear bomb by smashing it with a club. Uh, I'd sure love to try. [CASSIOS GROANS] It's not happening. Make it work. [♪♪♪] Alman! I know what you did. [GUNS COCKING] Come face me, you coward. Stand down. I'll handle this. Seiya, please. Alman! Please calm down. Stand back! You can't hide from me. Seiya. He took Patricia. He was in on it. There's more to it than that. No! No, you don't want to do that. You don't understand. Come with me. I'll tell you what really happened to your sister. Sienna, you know the rules. [ENGINE STARTS] You must not leave the mansion... [TIRES SQUEALING] ...grounds. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [SHUTS OFF ENGINE] [♪♪♪] You said you have answers. Hey! [GRUNTS] [CRACKLING, RUMBLING] Alman was there when Guraad took Patricia. He was a part of it. Tell me I'm wrong. He did it because of me. Look, when I was younger, I had no control at all. One night, my mom was holding me, and I had a burst of Cosmo. I don't even know how it happened. All I remember is she was holding me and I destroyed her arms. And the next moment, she was dying, and it was all my fault. Alman used the power of the gold armor to save her, but ever since the accident, Guraad needs Cosmo to stay alive. So what? You've got plenty of it. Athena's Cosmo is too powerful. It would kill her. That's why she sought out kids like your sister. What did she do to Pat? Your sister didn't have any Cosmo. Once Guraad figured that out, she let her go. But she sent her men to watch her. Guraad knew Patricia was hiding something. Me. That's why she never came back. Look, I'm sorry, Seiya. If I knew, I... [SIGHS] My mother was never the same after the incident. She became convinced that Athena had returned to this world to end it. She was gonna kill me, so my father forced me into hiding. And left Pat behind. Your sister wasn't the only one. We left them all behind. How many kids did your family take? Our radar picked up Guraad's signature. So it is happening. We don't stand a chance. You need to get out of here. I'll buy you as much time as I can. I'm not running from a fight. Find Sienna. Protect her. You're the only one I can trust. And, Mylock... You've been a good friend. Thank you. SEIYA: After Pat was taken, I-I ran away. All of these years, I've never stopped looking for her. Turns out she was the one who was keeping away from me. Your sister sacrificed herself because she believed in what you really are. I never asked to be a knight. I only wanted to be with Pat. You think I wanted any of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm a guest in my own body. In time, I thought I'd learn to control it. But you're fighting it. What if my mother was right? What if I was only born to bring ruin and misery into this world? That's not who you are. How do you know? I guess I just know. I need you to promise me, if things go wrong... if, in the end, I become a goddess of war and I can't control my powers... ...you will stop me, at all costs. You don't mean what I... Just promise me, please. [AIRCRAFT APPROACHING] That's my mother. Sienna, wait! You can't go back! You're the one she's after. I have to help my father. Okay. I'm with you. For now. [♪♪♪] [BEEPS] [♪♪♪] GUARD: Shut it! Shut it! [EXPLOSIVE BLAST] [GRUNTS] [FRANTIC SHOUTING] [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [GRUFF GRUNTING] [YELLS] [GRUNTS] It's clear. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Where's Seiya and whatever her name is? Sienna is not here, but I am willing to make a deal. Old man, you are in no position to be making deals. Wait outside, Cassios. Are you serious? Out! Hey! I really need to get to this ship. [GRUFF LAUGHTER] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHTER DIES DOWN] [SIGHS] Glad you understand. [GUN WHIRS, CLICKS] MYLOCK: How do you like my special bullets? Let's make this easy, shall we? Just tell me where she is. [CHUCKLES] Straight to business, then. What'd you expect after she almost killed me? That was an accident, and you know it. You can't blame Sienna for it. Oh, I never blamed Sienna. I blamed you, Alman, for leaving me to make all the hard choices. How is murdering a little girl even a choice? She's a sword of Damocles hanging over all of us. She's your daughter! We never had a daughter! What we had was an agreement, remember? That when she'd go out of control we'd do whatever had to be done, together. Sienna was entrusted to me. I'm responsible for her. I believe in her. You must believe in our child, too. What about all the children you took to make these? Hmm? Weren't you responsible for them? It was the only way to save you. And now I must save the rest of us from her. [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING FROM DISTANCE] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] Speaking of the devil. [♪♪♪] Dad? I didn't want to do this, but I won't let you hurt her. I know. Cassios! [GROANS] [CASSIOS GRUNTING FIERCELY] Enough. Get me the girl. You can do what you want with the boy. [ARMOR CLANKING] [GRUNTING] Seiya! We need to go! Hey there. I'm gonna take the girl now. But first, I want you. Let's end this now. No, Seiya, don't. It's okay. I've got the armor. Anytime now. Sienna, stay back! [GASPS] [GRUNTING] CASSIOS: Things have changed, kid. Face it, you don't have what it takes. [WHIRRING] [GRUNTING] [WHOOSHING] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [♪♪♪] [PAINED BREATHING] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [GROANS] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] I loved these glasses. [BEEPING] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [SIGHS] [PANTING] [GROANS] Stop! Stop! You've won. I'm coming with you. Let him go. Oh, you're coming with me anyway. [GRUNTS FIERCELY] [GUN CLICKING EMPTY] [PANICKED GRUNT] [ENGINES POWERING UP] Rescue on the way, kids. [♪♪♪] I'm sorry, but I'm taking you down with me. [GASPS] [DEVICE BEEPING] Go, go, go! [BEEPING RAPIDLY] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] No. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] It's ready. Give me a minute. Leave. [GRUNTING SOFTLY] [GASPS] You must think I'm the worst mother in the world. You... you killed Father. Alman chose his own way and left me to clean up his mess, as always. Athena's Cosmo is too strong. It won't fix you. I know. Yeah. I gave up on fixing this body a long time ago. We both have a bomb ticking inside, except yours is gonna be so much louder if we let it go off. I know I'm doing the right thing. [CRYING]: I just wanted you to know it doesn't make it any easier. Will it hurt much? I don't know. [♪♪♪] We need to start. Do it. [WHIRRING, ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [SIENNA SCREAMING] [GROANS, WHIMPERS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] Sienna. That ain't gonna help, kiddo. I let her get taken. I failed. We all did. I was supposed to protect her. Things don't always work out the way we expect them to. [♪♪♪] [WHIRRING] Come on, Seiya. [WHOOSHING] [♪♪♪] Marin. You were right about me. I failed. I'm not a knight. I couldn't save her. A knight should not mistake obsession for purpose. Seiya, focus. Who is it that you're trying to save? Pat. What does this... MARIN: Who are you really trying to save? [WHIMPERING NEARBY] [WHIMPERING CONTINUES] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know. It's okay. It wasn't your fault. [WHIMPERING]: Okay. [TREMBLING BREATHS] [♪♪♪] I'll bring her back. I promise. Okay. Let's go get Sienna back. How long will it take? NERO: To kill a god? Good question. We're about to find out. [SIENNA YELLS IN DISTANCE] [WHIRRING] [GROANING] [SIENNA SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [COMPUTER BEEPS] MYLOCK: Oh, boy. They got us on radar. What? Get ready. For what? I can get you close, but I can't land. [WEAPONS BLASTING] Parachute? Ha! Who says you're not funny? It's now or never! Open the doors. Get yourself out of here! Godspeed, kiddo. [PROJECTILES WHIZZING] [♪♪♪] [WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [EXPLOSIVE WHOOSHING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] Out of the way. Hey! [GRUNTS] He's mine. Big deal. You know how to glow. Step aside, Cassios, if you don't want to get hurt. Hurt? [SCOFFS] You should've died when you had the chance. [DEEP GRUNT] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] What was it that you said, Cassios? Right. [GRUNTS] Oh, no. [THUD] Things have changed. [SCREAMING] Finally, the goddess Athena reveals herself. [SCREAMING] [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] ALMAN [VOICE-OVER]: You must believe in our child, too. [SCREAMING CONTINUES] Stop! Stop the procedure! It'll be over soon. Now! We are not stopping! Get out of my way. [LAUGHING] Guards! Your services are no longer required. There's no stopping it now. In moments, she'll be nothing but a memory. Kill him. [WHIRRING] [GROANING] [GRUNTING] [CHUCKLING] [GRUNTS] [WHOOSHING] [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [SIENNA SCREAMING] You said it yourself, Guraad. When one goes to war with the gods, sacrifices must be made. There must be another way to protect humanity. Protect humanity? Is that what you think you're doing? [WHOOSHING] [GROANS] [♪♪♪] Killing Athena was only half of the battle. [WHIRRING] This is the other half. [GASPING BREATH] The gold armor. [GURAAD GROANS] [GRUNTING] [SIENNA SCREAMING] NERO: Can't let you do that. Thought you were the only knight in town? You got to get out of the way. [GRUNTS VICIOUSLY] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [RUMBLING, ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [SIENNA SCREAMING] [GURAAD YELPS IN PAIN] [PAINED GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [WHIRRING] [GRUNTS FIERCELY] [GRUNTING] You're no match for the Phoenix. [GRUNTS FIERCELY] Why do you try so hard? [SEIYA GROANING] She's not worth it. She's not even human. Sienna's not a god of war. I don't care what kind of god she is. Man needs no gods! [GRUNTING] [WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [WHOOSHING] [STRAINING] You don't know when to quit. People keep telling me that. [YELLING] [EXPLOSIVE WHOOSH] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] [GRUNTS] [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [POWER WHIRRING] [GRUNTING] Stop. You fool. [GROANS] [♪♪♪] Sienna! Listen to me! That's not your friend anymore! She's become the goddess of war. We have to stop her! [GRUNTS] [WHOOSHING] [YELLS] [EXPLOSIVE WHOOSHING] [STRAINED GRUNTING] SIENNA [VOICE-OVER]: Seiya... I'm losing control. I don't think I can hold her back much longer. You can't save me, but you can stop Athena. You must do it now. At all costs. [RUMBLING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [STRAINED GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [EXPLOSIVE WHOOSHING] [WEAKLY]: Sienna. [GRUNTS] You're not a goddess of war. No one's destiny is written in stone. Not even yours. The guardian of mankind or a petulant jerk... Whatever you choose to be, I'll never give up on you. [♪♪♪] [RUMBLING] [WHOOSHING] [WHOOSHING STOPS] [MUFFLED RUMBLING] Seiya. [♪♪♪] [TREMBLING BREATHS] [GRUNTS] [GROANING]: Why? Why? What was that for? Who's the petulant jerk? Oh. [LAUGHING]: Okay. Get up. [LAUGHING]: Okay. [GRUNTING] Let's get out of here. Wait. [BREATHING WEAKLY] I'm sorry. I was wrong about you. I wasn't so sure myself for a very long time. [SOFT WHIRRING] [INHALES DEEPLY] [WHIRRING, CRACKLING] [WHIRRING] [CHUCKLING] [GURAAD GASPING SOFTLY] You didn't have to do that. Yes, I did. [♪♪♪] Did I do this? Uh-huh. [GRUNTING] Mylock! Sienna! Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm glad you made it, Seiya. You, too. [SIENNA CHUCKLING] [TAKES DEEP BREATH] [WHIRRING SOFTLY] [♪♪♪] So, uh, boss... what do we do now? Athena's awakening is a sign the old gods will soon return and try to start a war. We need to gather all the Knights of the Zodiac to stop them. I'm at your service... my lord. [LAUGHS] Stop. Don't call me that. Oh, whatever you say, princess. Ugh, no, and definitely not that. Before we gather the knights, there's something else we need to do. What's that? It's time to find Patricia. Thank you. It's the least a goddess could do.
