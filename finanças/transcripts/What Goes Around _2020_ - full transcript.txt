- Oh. You okay? Yeah. - And that was my short film, The Voyeur. - Very good, and as you can see, anybody can make a film these days. Okay, I actually meant that by way of a compliment. I see exactly what you were trying to do, but what it does show is that with the access to technology these days, anybody can take a video or pictures of someone covertly, i.e., without their consent or their say so. In fact, just the other day, I was on the train and did notice that someone was also filming me. - Erin, order up for table 14, please. Yeah, sorry, a latte. - Um, excuse me? I actually ordered a skinny latte, and this has full cream milk in it. I'm sorry. - Holy shit, look at that thing. There we go. Oh, not shy now, are you? Aw, come on. Unlike you, mate, you're not a gent. - Nothing! I'll get her number, don't you worry. As cold as ice. Look at that, it's incredible. Yeah, not too bad, wow. - She is good. But you got no chance. Awful, mate. All my decisions. He's choking, Max. Max, are you okay? Someone help. Is he okay? What's going on? Max. Max, Max! I don't, I don't. Seriously, mate, come on. Max, he's choking, Max, Max! Max, Max, come on. Come on! Max, come on, come on. - Max! - Seriously, Max, seriously. Far out. Jesus, mate, you all right? Far out, I've never seen that before. - Oh my God. Have some water. - You all right to finish up out here? Yeah. - Sweet. See you tomorrow. Hi Rach. Are you ready for a big one tonight? - Um, about that, is that my towel? - Surprise! Remember how you said your mum was on vacay? Well, I remembered where the spare key was. Well, either that or I just haven't returned it. Anyway, let's at least do something fun. - Sounds good. Everything okay? You're wearing your mopey face. Yeah, for sure. Okay, well, whatever it is, we can talk about it when you get here. - Okay, see you soon. Erin? - Oh. Hey, Jake. - How's it going? - Good, just heading home. - Is that a new laptop? - This? - Well, yeah. - Nope. - Cool. Uh, are you seeing Rach tonight, 'cause we're thinking of heading to a party if you wanna join. - But I'm not really sure if it'll be a thing, though. I mean, what? It's just a bunch of people from high school. I mean, who would you even talk to? No offense. - That's okay. Rach and I have a lot to catch up on. - Well, if you change your mind, just message, yeah? - Thanks. ♪ You're a star, I like your style ♪ ♪ Bet you wish you know she's perfect for your smile ♪ Ah, welcome home, chica! - Hey! - Hey! Here, a Rachel Special. - What's in this? - Uh, vodka, oh, banana juice. - Great. - So, what's got you all hot and bothered? - Nothing, just uni stuff. How's the internship? - You know, you'd think that working at one of the top PR firms would at least lead to a celeb sighting. What I've been doing all week is filing papers. Oh, and listening to how Jenny and Monica's second pregnancy was just so much easier than the first. - Oh, no. - Oh, yeah, to say the least. Okay, are you going to tell me what's going on or do I have to guess? - I told you, just uni stuff. - Oh, and by that you mean Alex stuff. - Maybe. - Oh, wait, have you actually spoken to him? Not exactly. - Or followed him on Insta. - No. - Then what the F is it? - I sort of found his laptop. - Oh my God. Have you opened it? - No. Isn't that like a massive invasion of privacy? - Oh my God, you absolute stalker. I can't believe you know his password. - Well, he always sits right in front of me. - Oh, or is that because you always sit right behind him? - Shut up! Are you sure we should do this? - Come on, what are you waiting for? - Um. Why don't we check out his music? - Boring! But okay. - All I want is something to talk to him about. Okay. Sky Ferreira. Churches. Ariel Pink? - Hey, look, he even listens to the same true crime podcast as you. - This is too good! - Hey, cheers. To all of your hopes and dreams coming true. - I'm actually shaking. - Oh! - No way. - Yeah, even I draw the line at reading someone's emails, unless there are clear signs of potential cheating. - Okay, I'm going to shut it down. - Yeah, good idea. - You don't think it's him? You know, looking for his computer? - Why don't you add him on Facebook? Totally not weird because, you know, you're doing him a favor finding his laptop. - Yeah, I guess I could do that. Hey, do you want a top-off? - Sure. Cool, BRB. What happened? - So, are we done with show and tell for the night? - Yeah, yeah, I've definitely seen enough. - Would you totally hate me if I told Jake we might swing by a party later? - Yes. But I'll come. - Yay, it'll only be for a little bit, I promise. Here. Let's find you an outfit. - Hey. - Hey! Glad you guys could make it. - Of course, I've been missing you, you AF-SO. - Yeah, sorry, we've been doing plays at the hospital with crazy Alice. - There's hardly anyone from school here. - Yeah, I've been doing my best to meet new people. - But I'm still your fav, right? - Always. - Oh, I see you made it. - Your eyes are obviously working well. - Hey, girls, let's just play nice, can we? Good to see you, Marn. - Yeah, yeah. Should we go dance? Come on. - Hey, Rachel. And how is everyone else doing? - Rach, you look-- - Don't even go there, Tom. It's never gonna happen. Hey, how's your knee doing? - Still fucked. - But he's making some real progress, right, Tom? - Thanks to my new training partner. Uh, I can still pull mad beers if anyone wants one. - Wow, two years working in a bar and you can do that? - Hey, Ill even make you a Sex on the Beach. - I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Did you want me to come? - What's wrong with Erin? - What isn't? Sorry. - Erin, hey. I haven't seen you out in a while. - I. - Why don't you let me get you a drink? - No, no, that's fine. - Oh yeah, you do have a tendency to drink too much, don't you? - Baby, come talk to these people over here about the campaign. - Hey, you still live around here, right? 'Cause I'm running for local council. You're looking good, Erin. I hope I have your vote. - You're so fucking stupid, Erin. - I don't think so. Hey, you got great taste in music, for one. - Oh! - Did you see them play last summer at NextFest? - I couldn't afford it. - I thought I'd probably remember your face if I'd seen you there. I'm Alex. - Um, Erin. - So, Erin, what's the story? - Um, what do you wanna know? - Anything. - Uh, I love motorcycling, reality TV, and puppies. - AT least I can get behind two of those things. - Reality TV not your thing? - Nah, puppies, I hate dogs. I'm kidding. Everyone loves puppies, come on. You know, you'll have to take me for a ride on that bike some time. - I'm sure that could be arranged. So, tell me about you. - What about me? - Your hobbies. - Well, I like filmmaking. Mostly, I'm just off with friends. You're in my doco class as well, right? - Yeah, it's kinda what I wanna do. - I reckon you'd tell a pretty good story. - What makes you say that? - Just a feeling. Sorry. I've gotta go. Can I add you on Facebook some time? - It's Erin MacNeil, M-A-C-N-- E-I-L? Yeah. - Just gotta hope you accept me now, eh? Yeah, of course. - All right, well, um, I guess I'll see you later, Erin. - Bye. - So you actually talked to him? - Yeah. - Oh my. - He wants me to take him for a ride. - Oh, does he now? Stop. - Okay, so when is this hot date? - Oh, I don't know. Some time? - He added you on FB, right? Yeah. - So you gotta make the next move. Oh my God, invite him to my birthday party. - Oh, no, I don't know. No, come on! I mean, you hate my friends. It'll be perfect. - You do have a point. - Plus, then we'll be able to see if he really is as amazing as he seems. - Don't interrogate him. I'll try my hardest. - I brought your present. Open it. ♪ When your heart is full of nothing at all ♪ - Erin. ♪ And your body runs ♪ ♪ You forgot what for ♪ - Do you hate it? I'm sorry, I'll find another-- - No, I love it. Thank you, seriously. And I love you. Seriously, I would do just about anything for you. I would chop off all my hair. I'd jump off a cliff. I would even help you bury a dead body. Hey, to best friends and to not totally embarrassing me at my party. - Cheers to that. Hey. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. - Nah, it's all good, I understand. Takes time to look this good. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm cool. - Well, um, consider me your backup for any awkward situation. Oh my God! Hey! - Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Hey, where have you been? - Sorry, I-- - No, no, no, I'm sorry, it's my bad. I had to drop my little brother off at indoor soccer training, and made it late. - No problem at all. Alex, right? - Pleased to meet you. Pleasure. - He's gorgeous. - Did Erin just walk in here with the hottest guy ever? - I think she did. - Oh hey, come sit with us. So, uh, this is Cara, Marnie, Jake. You guys all know Erin, but this is Alex. - All right, Wet Pussy shots on the house! Happy birthday. - Cheers, to the birthday girl. - And to new friends. - I got you the cheaper version of your favorite. - Oh, that's so nice of you, thanks, Tom. How nice. - Keen for a dance, birthday girl? - Sure, Tommy. Okay, since when are you even low-key attracted to me? - Huh? - I'm talking about these over-the-top attempts at flirting. - Well, you are pretty hot. - Yeah, I know. I'm just saying, if you're trying to make Cara jealous, I think it's working. - So, Erin, how's your, um, I'm so sorry, I forget what it is you do. - It's a major in communications, right, Erin? - Yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, I'm doing business and commerce at Melbourne. - You've always been a really hard worker. - You know, I do what I have to. So, your course, is it like watching movies kind of stuff? - A little, yeah. More about the analysis and production of digital and print media. That sort of thing. - That's right, your little films. - Yeah, she's really good. - How would you know? - I watched your mini doco on YouTube about human trafficking. I didn't even know that stuff happened this side of the world. - That's really amazing, Erin. You know, I've always said, we really need to take action on that sort of thing. - Better behind the camera than in front of it I guess. - Hey, that's enough, Marnie. - Jakey, I'm just having a little joke. Erin doesn't mind, does she? - I'll be back in a minute. Hi, my name is Erin and sorry. Hi, my name is Erin. I'm such a freak. So, Alex. Are you and Erin like a thing? - I hope so at least. - Well, do you at least have, like, a brother or something? Preferably one as good-looking as you. - Not anymore. - What? - He's dead. - Hey, where's Erin? - Uh, I think she ran off to the bathroom or something. - Okay, am I missing out on a really bad joke here or what? - Come on, you've had enough to drink. I'll take you home. - I feel like Tequila Marnie's come out to play, and I really don't like that bitch. - Oh, like fuck you guys, like I'm just having a joke. - Well, if you're just having a joke at my best friend's expense, take your failed attempts elsewhere, can you? - Whatever. - Wanna go look for her? - Sure. - Okay. I should never have invited Marnie. I screwed up. - You had Erin's back in the end. That's what counts. - She's a very special girl. - Don't worry, I know. - I guess you're used to all this craziness. You know, having a little brother and all that. - Yeah, right, uh. So I'm guessing there's some history there. - I guess you could say that. Can I ask what happened? - Marnie always had it out for Erin. You know, calling her weirdo. It's just kid stuff. And? - Well, she should still at least pretend to be nice to her. Since we graduated, it was just the bitch 24/7. - So nothing in particular happened. - Not that I can think of. I mean, I have my suspicions they've butted heads over something, though. Erin, hey, are you okay? - Yeah, I just needed to sit out for a sec. - Well, you'll be happy to know the crazy bitch is gone, so it's just gonna be fun from now on, okay? - What's your favorite drink? Vodka, Coke, and lemon. - Interesting choice. Let's get three then. ♪ You glow in my heart ♪ ♪ You glow in my heart ♪ - Oh my God. Guys, best birthday ever! I'm gonna hug you. Oh! - Thanks for tonight. - Thanks for having me along for the ride. I'll see you in class on Monday? Good night. - Hey, it's me. I can see that, dummy. Was I a real piece of shit tonight? You definitely went to the dark side. - I'm gonna have to apologize to them tomorrow. Yeah, well, don't over reach on that. You didn't completely ruin their night. - Jake, after what happened that night, Erin's the one who should be shitty with us. I think I'm such a bitch to her sometimes because I feel really guilty. Me, too. All the time. - Just a sec. Okay, something really freaky is happening right now. You need me to come over? - Just stay on the line, okay? - Marnie, what the hell's going on? Oh my God, Jake. I need to quit drinking. Marnie, behind you! - They're upstairs. - Marnie, get out of there! - I'm so scared right now. Run, Marnie, run! Marnie! - Wake up. Birthday breakfast. - Oh, you're an angel. Oh, okay, please tell me last night was amazing because I don't remember anything. - It sure was. - Wait. Does this mean there was progress with Alex? He's a super sweetie, by the way. - Yeah, he is. - So? - Well, we sort of-- - Oh my God. - No, we didn't hook up or anything. - Erin. Jake. Hey. Yeah, I know, I just saw her, are you okay? Where are you? Okay. That's so messed up. Erin. Erin! Marnie's dead. - I know, sorry. Do you need me to take you somewhere? - Um, yeah. Jake's in a really bad way. He wants me to meet him at the park near his place. - Okay, let's go see him then. Are you getting ready? - Yeah, I'll be out in a sec. Jake. - Thanks for meeting me on your birthday of all days. Of course, sweetie. Are you gonna join us? - Sorry. - So, you were speaking to her at the time? - Yeah. We were just chatting. I wanted to make sure that she was okay. And then, I don't know, someone just attacked her. I wanted to call the police straightaway, begged me to stay on the phone. - I'm sure you would've done everything that you could. - I know it doesn't mean much now, but she wanted to apologize. - For what? - For what she did. - It must've been hard, just sitting there and watching helplessly. Erin! - It was. I really regret it. - I gotta go. Where? - Work. I thought you weren't working til five. - No, doing the two to nine. I'm sorry about Marnie. Help! - Erin, would you mind taking those milkshakes to those two over there. I'm absolutely swamped. Sure. - I just wanted to say thanks for helping me out in the course lately. Is everything all right? - I'm sorry, I'm such a wreck. - Hey, there's no need to be sorry. It's all right. - I just can't believe that anybody would want to kill her. - Yeah, I know, it's fucked. - And Cam, you know, he's busy right now with the campaign, and I just don't want to bother him with any of this stuff. - Well, you know, I mean, you can bother me any time you like. - Two raspberry milkshakes, one with almond milk. That one's mine. - Of course. - Thanks, wow. - How are you doing, Erin? Erin? - Great. Okay. You? - Yeah, great, thanks. - Great milkshake. Amazing. We should go for a coffee sometime. - Hey. - Hey. You ready for that ride? - Hell yeah. I'm impressed. - By what? - You. - What about me? - The way you rode that thing. It was insane. I guess I'll take that as a compliment. - You should. So you okay? - About what? - That girl Marnie. What happened to her was pretty brutal. - Well, so was she. - I noticed some weirdness between you and that Jake guy, as well. Did they do something to you? - It's not what they did. It's what they let happen. Something awful. Unforgivable. - Just know that I'll never let anyone hurt you. Not ever. She was a lovely girl. - Hey, thanks so much for coming. I know you two weren't the best of friends. - I'm here for you. - I didn't know what combo you like so I just got a selection of everything. - If there was a sweetie of the year award, you would definitely win. - It's not easy losing someone. - Then just don't say it, okay? Don't say anything, all right? - Oh look, it's the old high school squad. Hey. - Hey, guys, we were just talking about you. - Yeah, what Tom means to say is, um, we are so excited to have Rachel here working at the campaign on Friday. - What? - Oh, I didn't tell you? - No, you didn't. - Well, I mean, technically, my boss is working it. I'm shadowing her there. - Nevertheless, it'll be great to have you on the team. Right, baby? - Of course. - I still can't believe what's happened. - Yeah, um, it's a real tragedy. - Oh, um, this is Erin's friend Alex. You may have heard on my birthday, but this is Cam. - Hi. - I've gotta go. - Jake, wait for me. - Hey, mate, nice to meet you. - So you're the Cameron Bendell? - Oh, it's actually Bendel, but, uh, good to see my reputation precedes me though. - Well, your social media presence does, at least. - Oh. - He's going to be the youngest member ever of our local government when he wins. - Oh, no, I'm just thankful to have all the support, you know, especially from a major party. - Meanwhile I'm just slinging beers and getting wasted every weekend, so. - Quite the power couple then. - He's a very lucky guy. - I wouldn't count on that forever. Hey, guys, Jake's really freaking out. - Let's go and get the car. It was real nice meeting you, mate. - Jake? We're gonna take you home, okay? - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. She was, too, she really was. - She is now. Guys, I'll see you at the luncheon tomorrow. - Yeah, we look forward to it. - Watch where you're going, mate! Are you all right? Yeah. You almost killed them. - Yeah, sorry, I looked away for a second, and they were there. - Just get us home in one piece, okay? - I'll do my best. Here I was thinking you were a vodka girl. - I'm full of surprises. - Always got a few tricks up your sleeve, eh? - Yeah. Something like that. Hey, I'm sorry if the funeral brought up some stuff for you. - Not your fault. I just miss them, you know? My dad and my brother. - Whatever happened, it must have sucked. - Yeah. It should never have come to that. - Go, Tom, go, come on, come on, come on, you can do it! Oh my gosh! How'd I do? - It was over three miles. - Shit yeah! Thank you. That was so good. - Thank you. - Congratulations, Tomo. Hey! Yeah, thanks, man. - Well done. - Cheers. Oh, thanks. - Anyway, we better get going. Early morning. Oh, yeah, hey, about that. I'll be there first thing to help out. - Yeah, about that, um, I'm thinking we're all right. - What are you talking about? - Uh, well, Jake's got the morning off from the hospital, you know, so I'm just thinking it might be a better fit, you know? - But Tom's been helping us with the campaign this whole time. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but Tomo understands, don't you, mate? - Yeah, sure, mate, that's fine. - Good, good. Well, hey, make sure to come to class for a drink later, all right? - Course. - Good man. Get home safely, mate, all right? See you later. See you. - See you tomorrow. - See you then. Cara! - Oh! - Tomo! - Hey! - You gonna turn out the lights tonight? - Yeah, no worries. Catch you later. Hello, Tom. You forgot something. Triple 0, what's your emergency? - Fuck this. Sit! You've always been a follower, Tom, and now you're going to follow my instructions, if you wanna live. Don't you love the smell of gasoline? - What? Now let's talk about Erin MacNeil. Rings a bell, doesn't it? - Hey, hey, hey, it wasn't me. - What did you do? - Nothing, I didn't do anything! Look, it was, it was a joke. - Was it? - Please. Guys, do it. Oh my God. Oh, shit. Bring the camera. Whatever. Something tells me there's more to the story. - I, look, man, I swear that's everything. I swear, man. I think I've heard enough anyway. Thank you, Tom. - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, we didn't mean for it to go that far, all right? Oh, so we're gonna talk now? - Yes, yes, anything you want, please. Hey, look, I swear that's it. I swear on my mum's grave, all right? Thank you, Tom, you've been very helpful. - Hey, man, hey, please. No, no! No. No! - Oh my God, E, go online right now. - What's going on? Just do it! Fuck. I know. The reporters are saying that he was murdered. I can't believe it. - Wow. - To have two of our friends die in one week, I mean, like, what are the chances? - Yeah. Totally crazy. - Erin, I'm really freaking out! - Don't worry, you have nothing to worry about. I'm going to go wake Jake up and tell him. He's not going to take this well. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey, you. I was wondering what you were doing right now. - Just cleaning up. - You sound tired. - Yeah, it's been a big night. - Want someone to snuggle with? - Yeah, I'd like that. - I'll leave the front door unlocked. I told you I was going to leave the door unlocked. - I thought I'd let you call the shots. Is this okay? - Definitely. - Jake and Rachel are on their way, okay? Hey. - So nice of you to join us. - We need to be there for each other. - Yeah, that's the spirit. Why don't we take a seat? So. - Cheers to Tom. - And Marnie. - Cheers. - Uh, sorry, have I got the right place? I'm looking for a Cameron Bendel. - Yes, yes, you have, that's me. - Oh, hi, I'm Patty from Local Times. Are you still okay to have a quick chat? Mm hmm. - You didn't cancel the interviews? - Baby, I couldn't. I mean, we're this close to the election, and I already canceled the party. Cara. - Please. So. - Cara, Cara. Hey, come here. Are you okay? - Yeah, for sure, I was just getting some air. - Cara, it's okay to be upset. We all are. - I should be getting back. - That girl seriously needs a psychiatrist but she's gonna make a great First Lady one day. - If she makes it that far. - Come on, as if her and Cam will ever break up. He's serially cheats on her and she just takes it. That's not what I mean. - Then what do you mean? - You can't put what's been happening down as freak coincidences. - No, you can't put murder down as a coincidence but why would anyone wanna hurt Cara? Hey, if you know something, you can tell me. - Of course not! - Well, why are you acting so weird all of a sudden? I'm gonna go check on Cam, but can we talk about this later? Sure. - Are you really doing this now? - Doing what? - You told me you were done with this shit. - Please, I need them, just until the election. I wanna be strong for you! - If you can't handle the pressure now, how the fuck do you think it's gonna be when I get elected, huh? - Our friend was just murdered! - Don't you use his death to justify you being a selfish bitch. - I'm not. I just want things to be back. - What do you think people are going to say when they see my girlfriend zonked out of her fucking brains, huh, huh? Now get yourself together or get out. My name is Erin and I'm a freak. I am, like, so alternative, but like my hands are so much better than yours and yours. I grew this one eyebrow because I believe that feminine beauty is so. - Marnie, what are you doing? - Lighten up, babe. - Yeah, lighten up, babe. - Stop it, you're hurting her! - This isn't cool. - Bye, loser. - Thanks, babe. Oh my God, you dick. Yeah, sorry. This is a brand new outfit. Really sorry. - It's all right, you guys take her and I'll take care of her. - Why can't you take her? - Because she's a chick and it would be weird if I did. What's going on in here? - Jake, he vomited on my new outfit. - Come on, I'll take you to the bath and get you cleaned up. What the hell, you guys? You guys take her and I'll take care of Erin. - Fine, but this isn't cool. - You okay? - Both of you. A little help here. - Okay, I'm coming. - It's only a rock. - No, no, no! Stop it. - Those three words perfectly encompass what I'm going to bring to Oakwood. Community, connection, and, uh, something else. Forgot. - Shouldn't Cara be here? - Community, connection, and community, sorry, yes, go ahead. Can you tell us about some of your traffic policies? Sure. Help, help! Help, help! - Speechless, just like you've always been when it counted, huh? - Cleaning up our streets means not only just addressing our crime issues, but actually helping those in need get off the streets, as well. - Help, help, it's Cara, Cara, Cara's been attacked. - I'm sorry. - They were over there. Jake. - What the hell is wrong with you, huh? Where did you say they were? I don't know. Come on, let's get outta here. - It was Alex. - Erin's Alex? Sorry, folks, it's just a slight misunderstanding. - No, I saw her being attacked! - My girlfriend Cara and I had a slight misunderstanding this morning and I'm sure she was just down in the garden making a bit of a scene. I can't really blame my good friend Jake here for seeing this and jumping to conclusions. But if you'll please join me back up by the pool, we can continue to talk about the important work that really needs to take place in our community. Jake, wait! - His dad and brother were killed you know. - What? - Yeah, this guy I was seeing last year, he works at the university. I got him to get me some information from the database. - They keep that stuff on file? - No, there was enough information, I could do my own digging. - Jake, you're being ridiculous. What reason would he have to want to kill anybody? - He'd have his reasons, and not just him. - Jake. - Look, meet me tonight and I will tell you everything. Jake, why can't you just talk to me? - You need to see it to believe it. Why can't you just talk to me, Jake? - Look, meet me at nine at yours, all right? - Okay. Erin! We need to talk. - What about? - Alex! - You're right. Come sit down. Okay. - The sex is amazing, in case you're wondering. That is not what I meant! - You're the one that's telling me I need to put myself out there. - Erin, I think there's something seriously wrong with him. - What? - Hey, I didn't know what kind of guacamole you said you liked, so I just brought whatever the store had. Aw, I would've gone for whatever. Only the best for my girl. Hey, Rach. Erin, we need to leave, now. - What are you talking about? Alex just got here with dinner. - Yeah, come one. - Erin, please come with me. - What's got you so upset? I don't understand. - I told you, there is something seriously wrong with him. - Because he likes me? - No! Jake saw him attack Cara and-- - And that makes him what? - Then explain to me what happened to your dad and your brother. - That was an accident. Accidents happen sometimes. Look, Rach, we get it. Three people that you know have died. - So you did kill her. - No, sorry, what I meant was, um, what we think you need right now are your friends. - Okay, you stay the hell away from me. - I'm not gonna hurt you, all right? I'm just want you to sit down and talk to us. - Erin, if you don't come with me right now, I'm going to call the police. - And what are you gonna tell them? - Yeah, what are you gonna tell them? - What I saw, and the fact that since you came into her life, anyone she doesn't get along with ends up dead. - Well, um, from where I'm standing, it doesn't look like you two are getting along too well, either. - Are you threatening me? - I never said that. - You're delusional. If you go to the police, I will never speak to you again. Ever! - Rachel? Hey, where are you? - I'm at Oakwood Reserve. What's happened? - You were right about Alex. Okay, I need you to tell me everything that you know, and then we need to go straight to the police. - All right. - Okay, tell me everything. - It's all on here. - What the hell am I supposed to do with that? - Just take it home and watch it. - No, Jake, we don't have time for this. Wait, no, I think I've got my computer in the back of my car. I got it! Jake? Fucking hell, Jake! - Sorry, I was just feeling a little exposed in the park on my own. - Well, I was feeling a little bit terrified when a strange man walked up behind me. - Sorry. - Give me the damn USB. - Is this what you want? It's just you and me now, princess. Oh, Cara sure doesn't have tits like these. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ssh. Yeah, you love it, don't you? - What the hell? Hey, whoa. - Hey! Tom, get off him! Cam, Cam. You're disgusting. - That asshole. I'm gonna-- - Kill him. Don't worry, I'll take care of that. Erin, wake up. - What's going on? I have something very special to show you. Call it Avenging Erin. - Why is she here? - Same as you, to watch the show. She's even gonna star in this part. - Please don't include her in this. - It's too late for that. Here's our leading man. - Cara! What the hell? - Put it on, darling. My business partners are going to be very happy with this. - Your business partners? Come on, baby, as if you didn't know. - Know what? - The minute you picked up that computer, you were starring in a movie. My best one yet. My work doesn't really usually have a story per se, so this was a bit of a coincidence. Really gives it that extra production value, you know? Now, what do you have to say to her? - I'm sorry. I wanted to help, but after it happened, I stole Cam's phone and emailed the video to myself, but he found out. By the next morning, my family were receiving all sorts of threats. - But you still could've done something! - But you didn't. - But I did! I kept a copy. - And where's that been hiding all these years? - His family, I was scared of what they would do. - We can work this out, man. - Baby, pass me that bag over there, please. Today, come on. - Stop it, stop it. - Shut up, bitch, or I'll cut your fucking tongue out! Come on. - Here you go. - Open it. That's it. That's my girl. Go on, do it. Erin, don't! - Do it. - Oh, get off me! - Stop, please, Alex! I said no! - Now. Wait! - Now, since Erin doesn't wanna get her hands dirty, I'm gonna leave that to you guys, and let's be honest, your hands are already pretty fucking dirty, aren't they? - What do you mean? - I mean either you kill him or he kills you, winner gets out of here alive. - No. - What was that? - I said no. - Fuck this. Jake. - Now what do you have to say to her? - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. - You love it, don't you? Erin, what have you done? - Now, I bet that felt good. What are we gonna do about her? - Well, I was thinking, seeing as she's your best friend, something quick and painless. - Yeah, that would be nice. Can I do it? - Erin, please. Please, Erin. - Alex. - Yeah? Erin! Get off her! Bitch! Erin! - I really thought you were the one. Erin. - I'm so sorry, Rach. It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay. - Remember that time you said you'd help me bury a dead body? ♪ Do I look like Judas ♪ ♪ I cannot betray you ♪ ♪ I can never play you ♪ ♪ Baby you should know ♪ ♪ You're not a mistake now ♪ ♪ We're not a mistake ♪ ♪ Your heart is not a playground ♪ ♪ You should know I know ♪ ♪ But all I want for you ♪ ♪ But all I want ♪ ♪ I've been through the fire ♪ ♪ And I made it ♪ ♪ I've been all about your heart and soul ♪ ♪ You done been through hell ♪ ♪ I just wanna bring you back ♪ ♪ Heaven is a drug you don't wanna do without ♪ ♪ Loving you is diamonds and you're so all of that ♪ ♪ You deserve, you deserve all the love, you ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak you should never hurt no one ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't come around here ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak you should know ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't come around here ♪ ♪ Uh uh, I don't believe you when you say ♪ ♪ Uh uh, you don't believe the love he gave ♪ ♪ I can take the pain away ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ I pray for the worst to go ♪ ♪ Tomorrow will be kind to you ♪ ♪ But all I want for you ♪ ♪ But all I want ♪ ♪ You done been through hell ♪ ♪ I just wanna bring you back ♪ ♪ Heaven is a drug you don't wanna do without ♪ ♪ Loving you is diamonds and you're so all of that ♪ ♪ You deserve, you deserve all the love, you ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak you should know I know ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't come around here ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak you should know I ♪ ♪ Heartbreak please don't hurt me ♪ ♪ Heartbreak, please don't come around here ♪
