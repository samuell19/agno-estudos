Come on, Hannes. Don't get tired. You can do it. He'll never make it. He'll fall down. I'm scared. - Then don't watch, Sis. - Stupid bitch. Monkey. You can do it, Hannes. Come on, higher. Come on, now on to the roof. Then we move the other leg. He'll fall down. I'm scared. Just shut up. You're making me nervous. Hannes, go on. - Come on, higher! - Faster! Don't go into the hole! Coward! - You have to go up to the ridge. - Shit. "Come on, you coward. Up to the ridge." Bastards. He is the youngest. He should only go half the way. No special favors. He wanted to join, so he must go up to the ridge. Pull yourself together! Damn. Hurry up a bit. Don't rush him. Or else he'll fall down. - I'm so scared. - Again? No, still scared. Come on, Hannes. Go on. - Don't look back all the time. - He's in a blue funk already. Well done, Hannes. Now say the slogan. I'm on the roof. I've reached my goal. As of today I am a Crocodile. We are the Crocodiles. The Suburban Crocodiles. Cowards are doomed. They will be eaten by the crocodile. What a feeling! The crocodile on the hunt. Come down now, Hannes. Be careful. Hang on tight. Well, Killer. What do you think? The kid has done well. Yes, well done. Help! Help! Help! Help! I'm falling down. - Stay here, you cowards. - I'm falling down. - Fire department. - There's somebody hanging from the roof. - Where? - At the old brick manufacture. - Kurt, whom did you call? - The fire department. Somebody's hanging from the roof. Hannes Burgsmüller. For God's sake. Help! Help! I'm falling down. - Where do you go? - To Mrs. Burgsmüller. Help! Help! I'm falling down. I can't reach him. It doesn't work. The firefighters are coming. Shut up. You should get a proper spanking. You could be dead now. Be glad that you're not my boy. Were you alone? I asked if you were alone. Now, tell me how you got up there. What's your name? Where do you live? Burgsmüller. Hannes Burgsmüller. I live in the parrot settlement. But I can go home on my own. - You stay right here. - You won't go home on your own. We take you home. We want to talk to your parents. - We have made fools of ourselves. - We were cowards. We can't fly like Jesus. We couldn't do anything. We were cowards. What if Hannes had fallen down? Then he would be dead now Don't think about it! But I would like to know why the firefighters arrived so quickly. - Boy! - He could be dead now. What a foolishness! What if no one had called us? What a foolishness. What were you thinking? He should be able to read the sign: Keep out! Danger of collapse! It's not there for fun. Ask him who was with him. I doubt that he was alone. Thank you! I'm so glad. If he were my son, I would teach him a lesson. Thank you! I'm so glad that nothing happened. I'd like to know where the firefighters suddenly came from. Exactly at the right moment. Maybe they're clairvoyants. Or have hidden cameras. Anyway, everything went well. I'd still like to know where the firefighters suddenly came from. You should be glad that they came at all. You just ran away. Scared. Scared to death. You have no reason to act up. You didn't get Hannes from the roof. You guys ran away as well. I have to go back home immediately. I'm grounded. Shit. Take off your pants. Do you know who called the fire department? Kurt Wolfermann. - The cripple? - The wheelchair race driver? - That little fellow? - He was watching us through the binoculars... - And then he called the fire department. - That must be strong binoculars! Wolfermann, he of all people. Shit. Easy for you to say. I have to go to him now. - To thank him. - Thank him? Otherwise I'll be grounded even longer. Why thank him? He does nothing else than watch other people all day long! What if he hadn't called the fire department, idiot? - Has the penny dropped? - Then go thank him, Hannes. What's that? Show me. Listen to this nonsense. The tree house has to be dismantled within one week or it will be demolished by city workers. Please leave the area in a clean state. The forester. - What the fuck? - We put so much work into the tree house. - The forester couldn't care less. - What now? You don't seriously believe that we'll tear down the tree house, do you? Those stupid "macaroni" are just what I need right now. Get lost. Leave them alone. They haven't done anything. They don't even speak German. - So what? Do you speak Italian? - This is not your private property. - Now you're proud of yourself, right? - You assaulted little kids. You're a hero. This is against our agreement that we never assault people weaker than us. They should stay where they came from. We don't go to little Sicily either. I have to go. I'm grounded. Hannes, your pants! He has to thank him. I can't believe it. - I wouldn't say thanks. - No one asked you to. I'm waiting out here for father. - But stay here. Don't drive away. - Ok. Wolfermann, I am supposed to thank you. My father said so. - Well, then do it! - I just did. Fine. - Are you a member now? - Can't you see that? - Have you read the newspaper? - I don't read newspapers. Always the same crap. There was another burglary. They broke into a radio shop. Olaf says that the burglars are Italians or Turks. - Why? Was he there? - Of course not. So how does he know then? Stop asking stupid questions. There's my father. I have to go. Leave the truck at the entrance of the depot. Bye! - Do you want to come in? - No. Now, get out of there. - Hi, Mom! - Hello. Kurt, you're getting heavier. That's impossible. Maybe you are getting weaker. That's impossible. Anyway, you are getting naughtier. Mommy! I have to leave at five o'clock tomorrow morning. - I'm working the early shift! - Every day on a different shift! At least I have a job. Pretty cold, isn't it? 1000 mark reward. For information. The sixth burglary within four weeks. It's here in the paper. - Who do you think the burglars are? - I don't know. At school they say it could be foreigners. It could be! People hear the grass grow around here. - Do you think the burglars are foreigners? - I don't know. And I don't care. Don't drag those foreigners into this. How much do you get for an hour of babysitting? - Leave me alone. - Want to go to the swimming pool? I can't. As you can see. - Just leave your sister at the bike racks. - You have lost your marbles. See you tomorrow at the tree house then. Why do I always have to be the babysitter? Stupid baby! Why do I always have to be the babysitter? Stop laughing! Are you calling the doctor? Someone broke into the electronics warehouse. You could really spend some time with that boy. Even if he's not able to walk. Well, because he's not able to walk. But he can't go anywhere. If you had fallen from that roof, you might be sitting in a wheelchair now. I don't even want to think about it. Did you feed the rabbits? I'm doing it right now. - And did you clean the cage? - Yes. Here you go. Hurry up. But don't forget half of it again. Now that he joined those Crocodiles, they could spend some time with Wolfermann. How is that supposed to work? It's easy. They can take him along. It's not so hard to push a wheelchair. They would have to adjust to his pace. Why do you care about this all of a sudden? - He saved Hannes' life. - Now please don't hold a thanksgiving service. - But it's true! - I'm going into the garden. I would like to know what the police is doing. - Waiting for the burglars to turn themselves in? - What are they supposed to do? Two Altbier and one Kölsch. They can't place two policemen in front of every shop each night. Boy, I really like you. But do you always have to block my way? What is he supposed to do? Vanish into thin air? - That's not what I meant. - Give me a beer. There's only one topic today. But you have to admit that they were pretty bold. I wonder how they managed to get into the electronics warehouse. They entered through the top window. That's at least six meters high. They are professionals. They should search the houses of those "spaghetti" from Italy. Do you think they store the stuff at home? - If they are responsible at all... - Exactly. Grandpa, watch out for the flowers. I'm leaving. I don't want to have anything to do with you guys. Three beers, three schnapps! What are you looking at? Maybe he gets paid for staring at other people. Who did this? Your father is in the bar. I know. Whenever he goes into the garden, he goes to the bar. - Do you want to see the tree house? - I can't drive there on my own. Besides, I don't think the others would like it. Let this be my problem. Shit on the graveyard wall... disturbs the women while mourning. Shit on the steeple... stinks at great heat. I don't believe it. What's wrong? What's going on here? We are not a hospital. This is a public space, right? Feel free to play Good Samaritan... but then take off the crocodile. Come on, guys. Let's go on. - What do you want here? - Show Kurt the tree house. - Is that forbidden? - You know Olaf... He always feels like the king... Come on, let's got. Bastards! Assholes! What has Wolfermann done to you? It's always the same. First he comes to see the tree house... And then he stays and thinks he belongs to us. - Why would that be so bad? - Are you nuts? We can't use this slow coach. At least he knows where he stands now. - He would be a millstone around our necks. - That's no reason to treat him like dirt. Not so fast. You're going to tilt it over. Olaf doesn't mean it. I know him. It's all right. Let's go on playing. - Are you going to the school party? - No. It's not my school after all. - Everybody is allowed to come. - Anyway. What would you do if you knew the three burglars? Me? - Why did you say three? - What would you do? How do you know there are three burglars? Just a guess. So what would you do? Report them to the police! Wouldn't you do that? Of course, I would. I have to go home. Bye. - Bye, Mrs. Wolfermann. - Do you want to stay for lunch? No, thanks! I'm not hungry. I have to be home at one o'clock. Tell me, mother, am I a big burden to you? - What? Who said that? - Nobody, but I can feel it. The Crocodiles do not want me, because I can't climb on trees or drive a bike. Oh, Kurt. You have your own talents that they don't have. You have been doing fine without these guys so far. I was in the tree house today. Right at the top. You have a great view from there. - How did you get up there? - I was floating. Like an angel. - Guess what I have for you. - A camel? - Wrong! - An elephant? Completely wrong! - Damn it! - But... Don't get mad, mommy. I found it in the garbage. Nonsense. I bought it used. Well, what do you say? Wolfermann, how much horsepower does your car have? Can I try it? - He doesn't talk to everyone. - Do you talk to everyone? Suit yourself. Hey, monkey. You are supposed to come home immediately. Give it to me in writing. If you weren't my brother, I'd show you... Put on a different record. Get lost, you bastard. The tree house is gone! The tree house is gone! When I arrived, it was gone. Come on, let's go to the tree house. If I only knew who did that. I know what I would do with them. - That's so mean! - There's a a piece of paper over there. What does he want here? I warned you. The forester. Damn it. They always chase us away. Fucking shit. Where are we supposed to go now? You could go to the old brick manufacture. No one ever comes there. Except for the firefighters. You may get old and gray, but not rude. But it's true. Kurt saved... You all ran away. - That's how it is. - Give it a rest! Your proposal is not so bad, race driver. Now you notice? You're a quick thinker. Kurt, I'm just telling you... Father doesn't like you to hang out with these Crocodiles. - And you? - Why me? - I think father is right. - They are very kind to me. Hannes is very nice. And Maria as well. And the others? What am I supposed to do during holidays? We don't go on vacation. - Kurt? - Yes! - What are you doing here? - We come for Kurt. - Where do you want to go? - Just for a walk. Man, you're heavy. Danger of collapse. No trespassing. - If my father knew... - He doesn't have to know. Come on. It's huge. It's shit. Are you kidding me? - Your sister and Hannes. - And the race driver. Wait, I'll show her. Come on! What's going on? Stop staring. Help us to get Kurt through the fence. - Why? - Because he can't stand alone out here. Nobody invited him to come. - I did. - And who are you? As much as you, asshole. I have nothing against the race driver, but we have no use for him in our gang. Period! - Then I quit the gang. - Me too. You're nuts! You're mean. My father says he saved my life. - But he didn't safe mine. - Not much to safe anyway. Even if we wanted him to join, it wouldn't work, as you can see... Just give it a try. I've got some pliers. We could cut a hole in the fence. He's prepared for everything. Ok. Just for today. We'll give it a try. - We did it, boy. - Yes, we can do everything. So, what now with the race driver? - Can he come here or not? - Not with us! But he doesn't bother anyone. Today is an exception. Olaf, say something. Maria can't get away with everything, just because she is your sister. - Kurt is gone. - So what? He's more independent than we think. Anyway. I feel responsible for him, because I brought him here. You should have thought about this in advance... Don't start again. Hannes, we'll go look for him. Perhaps he climbed a tree. Help! Help! You look over there and we go over here. Kurt, where are you? I'm here. Come over here. I got to show you something. I'm here in the corridor. Be careful, there's a hole. Nothing but trouble with the race driver. This was the first and last time we let you join us. We should leave you here. I can't get out of here on my own. Go have a look what's behind those slats. Have a look. I know what it is. Are you a clairvoyant? - Who would have thought? - A repository. This is probably the stuff stolen from the electronics warehouse. What else could it be, wise guy? - Kurt must have known it. - Man, he is a clairvoyant. Whether you believe me or not, I knew nothing. It's just a coincidence. But when I saw the boxes, I immediately knew it. - Why do you think it belongs to the burglars? - Whose stuff could it be otherwise? They have to hide the stuff somewhere. There's a 1000 mark reward. We only have to find out who they are. I know it. You know it? - What does he know? - Who the burglars are. Why doesn't he tell us then? - Why don't you report them to the police? - Because I can't prove it. It's just like on TV. - What about the repository? - Is that a proof? Who is it? Three men with mopeds. That's all I know. One of them has a fox tail and colored ribbons on his moped. - That's all I know. - That's something for starters. It's nothing. My brother has a moped with a fox tail and colored ribbons. - So what? - What do you mean? Calm down. I didn't mean it like that. You better not. What are we waiting for? Let's find them. Do you know how many mopeds there are in our town? We'll find out. You didn't tell the truth, did you? - I did. - But you know more than that. - You know the burglars. - Of course I know them. Why don't you report them to the police? If I tell you, do you keep quiet? Egon is one of them. Egon? You don't mean Frank's brother? Yes, Frank's brother. - No! - Yes! What's wrong? I need the toilet. Sorry. - Are you all right? - Kurt needs the toilet. Kurt needs the toilet. - You gotta be kidding! - Why? We all do sometimes. - Poo or pee? - Pee. He needs to pee. - I'll drive you home. - Too late! Two of you have to lift me up and one has to unzip my pants. - But you can pee on your own, right? - Yes. So, what now? Did you see that? That's how it's done. - Anyone in for a game? - Me... There he is. And his two accomplices. Don't tell the others! Hey, you! You can't drive around on the lawn with your cart. Why not? He can't walk. - He's not using the wheelchair for fun. - I don't care. He can't use his cart here on the lawn. It's a wheelchair, not a cart. He can't use his wheelchair here on the lawn. He's going to ruin the lawn. Do you know how expensive this is? I can't see a sign that only walking people are allowed here. Don't answer back to me. It goes without saying. - I don't understand that. - Me neither. Could I come here on crutches? Of course you could. But crutches make deeper holes than a wheel chair. See. Stop it! Either he stays on the plates or he must leave. But he has paid for playing. You stay out of it, Steffenhagen. Or I'll tell your father. My brother's right. What a bastard. I'll show you... I know you! You leave. I have a plan. Here, I make the rules. - I don't come into your gardens... - But we don't charge money. - Don't hit me. - Don't be ridiculous. He really has to leave? Yes, he has to leave. What are you doing? Damn it. - Take the boy with you. - Sorry, but his wheels would ruin the lawn. You have to leave now. Don't be so stubborn. Help me. Be a good boy. I didn't mean to do that. Don't cry. I didn't mean to do that. Police! Assault Attempted murder! Murderer! To lay hands on a helpless person, you're a monster. You'll pay for this. We take him to a doctor. If he got hurt, you'll be in big trouble. I didn't mean to do that. Of course he can stay. Even for free. He gets a free ticket for a whole year. - Did you say free ticket? - Yes. Eleven! - Eleven what? - Eleven free tickets. You must be crazy. That's out of the question. Well, let's go to the doctor. Stay here! You get the free tickets. - But this is blackmail. - Call it what you want. We are the Crocodiles. The Suburban Crocodiles. - Crocodile, bite me! - Julia, get lost! Let's have a race. Kurt, we have to go. Yes, of course. - I'm really thirsty. - They'll be here any minute. They are totally crazy. Here, help yourself. You can't drink that. You'd get drunk. Maybe you would, Hannes. Here, Hannes. Or are you scared? I finally want to know if Kurt is a member now. Why? He has always been with us of late. But is he a member now or just a guest? Well, he's right in the head. He is quite norm... Normal. Except that he can't walk. - He's a slow coach. - No one asked for your opinion. He's quite useful. I mean, this thing with Hannes... And then the burglars. He's quite useful. And he discovered the repository. Otherwise we wouldn't have anything to drink now. I think he should be a member. - What about the trial of courage? - Are you stupid? Is he supposed to climb the roof? - Who is in favor? - Me... - I'm against it, because... - Unanimously against one. Be quiet. I hear something. - That's Egon! - Your brother. What are they doing here? What are you doing here? We could ask you the same. We're going for a walk. - Do you mind? - Don't talk back to me. Do you have something to drink? We have opened a bar. - Frank, where did you get the bottles? - They fell from the sky. - Santa Claus brought them. - In the middle of summer. If you don't answer me, I'll tell father. Go ahead. Then I'll tell him that you climb out of the window every night. If you touch him, then... I'll get you, bastard. If I were you, I would be more cautious. - What's that supposed to mean? - You heard it. - Bastards, get lost. - Assholes. You drunken morons! You idiots! - Hey, not so fast. - Calm down, babysitter. She's getting her period. Kurt, don't go away. Be reasonable now and tell me everything. I've already told mother that I know nothing. I know how good this thing is at night. Listen to me. - You do trust me, right? - You know them as well. - From the neighborhood? Who is it? - Egon. - Steffenhagen? - And Karli and Gustav. You may not know them. I do know them. - What now? - This is mess. - Shall I go to the police? - For heaven's sake, no. - I could earn a thousand mark. - We can't report anyone from our neighborhood. Steffenhagen is a member of the city council. He'll make our lives a living hell here. - Did you tell anyone? - Maria Weißmann. But she'll keep quiet. That's what you think. Women can't keep quiet. You don't know anything, and you haven't seen anything. I told the others that I saw three mopeds and three young men. Too much already. Egon is Frank's brother. Frank doesn't like me. But we discovered the repository. Where they hide the stolen items. In the brick manufacture. What are you doing at the brick manufacture? - There's a sign: Keep out. Danger of collapse. - Parents will be held responsible for children. The Crocodiles have built a hut over there and then we accidentally discovered the repository. "We", Kurt? Are you a Crocodile now? Those were peaceful days when he didn't hang out with these Crocodiles. Now you don't know what to do and I must come up with something again. If Maria knows it, her brother will know it very soon. And so on... But we cant' report them. It would be a scandal. Listen. If nothing else works, you simply say: We discovered the repository. But we don't know whose it is. And that's all you know. That's good, mom, right? Kurt, that's almost the truth. We don't know the burglars. We only know their repository. We assume that it's their repository. We can't go to the police. We could at least report that we have discovered the repository. But we won't get the reward then. The newspaper says that there is a 1000 mark reward for "information". Information. We don't have to give them names and addresses. Kurt, you saw the burglars. - I only saw three men with mopeds. - That's enough. That's not a proof, only my testimony. We don't even know that the repository belongs to the burglars. These "macaroni" again. Get lost. Now tell us. Frank is outside. Listen. What are they doing here again? - You have just seen the three burglars. - Are you crazy? Frank's brother? - You'll have to prove this. - I will. Sit down and listen. I just tell you what I know. I saw three men who broke into the electronics warehouse. You did that very well. Remember that we leave at 16:30. Make sure Frank doesn't notice. We leave at 16:30. Let's synchronize watches. Make sure that Frank doesn't notice. What if something goes wrong? Or if nothing happens at all? We have decided to do it. And what Kurt is saying makes sense to me. They probably know we discovered the repository. And today is the best day to get the stuff out of the basement. Everyone's at the school party. So they can get their stuff. - In broad daylight? - Everyone's here. I hope this will work. Trivets, potholders, slippers. Self-made. Perfect quality. We leave at 16:30. Make sure Frank doesn't notice. - How am I supposed to do that? - You'll come up with something. Proper German workmanship. - What, your parents are away again? - They'll be here soon to pick up the screamer. We leave at 16:30. But without the stroller. This arrow could kill someone. - I wouldn't try it. - Maria makes sure Frank doesn't notice anything. - Lifetime warranty for everything you buy. - Maria, did you see Kurt? I saw him at the sausage stand. Bring some for me! Ok. We can go now. - Do you know where Kurt is? - He's doing archery. Over there. Stay here for a second. - Mrs. Burgsmüller, do you know where Hannes is? - I don't know. You must be kidding! We have to leave. Could you take over for a second? - I didn't say that. - Where is Kurt? Leave him alone. He's just having some fun. Where is my son? These guys here have absolutely no clue... - Now what? - We have to wait. Easy for him to say. Do you see something? We could practice archery. Kurt brought his bow. I wouldn't do that. They might see us. Can't you just sit here for an hour? I have to do this all day long. That's different. Sitting is your profession. Be quiet. There's something. Now they get out of the car. I'm going crazy. Kurt is right. I see them quite clearly. Karli, Gustav and Egon. I'm going crazy. Karli's coming towards us. - What do we do now? - Holy shit. And what now? - Shut up, you stupid cow. - If you continue to be so rude, I'll scream. No one there. Give me that one as well. Be quiet. Someone's coming. - They might screw up everything. - We should have thought of them. Don't worry. They're glad they got away. These fucking "macaroni" will screw up everything. We have a visitor. - What do we tell him now? - The truth. Nice mates you are. No one told me you were leaving. I really tried to find you. Stop lying! Why don't you want me around? Why shouldn't we want you around? You don't disturb anyone. Come on, follow me. Here, you'll see. That's my brother. - It's Egon! Yes! - What are they doing here? Why are you hiding? They get the stuff they have stolen. The stuff in the basement. Say that again. I'm gonna kick your ass. Are you crazy? It's true what he said. Or do you think they'd take the stuff if it's not theirs? That's doesn't prove anything! Did you see them stealing it? We didn't, but Kurt did. Yes, Kurt saw them breaking into the electronics warehouse. - And you who believe him? He's a... - What? - Say it. - The cripple is full of shit. Say that again. What's this bugger doing here? I'll show him. - What are you doing here? - And you? I asked you. I'm watching you carrying away the stuff you have stolen. What are you doing with it anyway? You must be tired of life. Do you even have a drivers' license for the car? One more word from you, slow coach, and... One step closer and you'll have an arrow in your belly. One more step and I'll shoot again. Get lost. Kurt, what happened? These pigs. He could be dead now. And Egon? He could have hit him in the belly. I've seen everything. Shut up, monkey. That's something else entirely. Kurt had to fight back. He was helpless. Helpless? He almost killed my brother. This hypocritical bastard. He's only acting. Stop it. Are you crazy? You mean pigs. - Now we go to the police. - Sure, we'll report them. - No! - What? You could be dead. I am not dead. - We must do something now. Report them. - You can't report Frank's brother to the police. Or Karli. His father works for the highway patrol. What do you say, Olaf? Say something. Report them. Exactly, now we go to the police. - He could at least have said something. - It makes no sense to wait any longer. Calm down. It's not the first time that he's been away with the others. That makes me nervous. They are probably at the old brick manufacture. - Could you go have a look? - I'll talk to him when he comes home. Yes, if he comes. Don't play up now. I'm not against going to the police but... We just say that we discovered the repository. That's all we know. We could also say that we saw a transporter and three young men. What's the difference? We make a report, but we don't tell on Egon. And if the police catches them, it will look like we have reported them. It makes no difference. Kurt is right. We can still say that we have not reported them. I bet the police won't catch them anyway. My father says the police is so stupid that it's almost illegal. What now, dear brother? Are you going in or not? - Or are you afraid? - Me? I'm not afraid. - I'm curious to see what happens now. - Maybe they won't believe us. The police believes everything. It's their job. Come in. - We saw a VW caravan... - Wrong! - VW transporter! - What's your name? - Kurt Wolfermann. My father works for the city. - He drives a garbage truck with radio. All right. A VW transporter... driving away with three young men... - Approximately 17-20 years old. - Large? Small? How were they dressed? - Large. - No, small. - Medium in size with a leather jacket. - He wore a denim jacket. - Could you make up your mind? - Be quiet. He was definitely wearing a leather jacket. - If you lie to us... - But you can verify it for yourself. You know exactly what we mean. Now... Who are these three guys? We can't give you names and addresses. You'll have to do at least some of the work. There were three men. With or without a leather jacket. Ego... One of them had a leather jacket. - Do you know what a protocol is? - No. We are not stupid. A protocol is something official. This means you have to tell the truth. So who are these three young men? We told you everything we know. All right. As you wish. - You must see a doctor. It looks bad. - That damn guy. I didn't think he'd really shoot. Shit. The doctor will give me a sick note. - I'll get in trouble with the foreman. - You think they'll report us to the police? - No, Frank was with them. - What if they do? Then we're done. Anyway, we didn't report them. We only gave some information. It's basically the same thing. What were we supposed to do? Anyway, we lied to the police. Nonsense, we just didn't tell them everything. Stop it now. It's early in the morning. Going to the police? What were you thinking, Kurt? My son reports neighbors to the police and today it's even in the newspaper. Yesterday, the police arrested five Italian children. Some of the stolen items were found with them. The parents were searched as well. Is it really theft if you steal something that has already been stolen before. Kurt, you know that these children didn't do it, right? We all know that. They just took what the others had stolen before. You have to find a solution for this. That's insane. He's not supposed to tell names. But he has to prove that the children didn't do it. How is he supposed to do that? I'll be late tonight. Bye. - Now what? - I don't know. You must help these children. Even if the little Italian boy was caught with the bicycle. Kurt, you really have to. - What did the doctor say? - He gave me a sick note. Now we're safe. It was a good thing that these Italians came around. - Your brother didn't say anything? - Not a word. - But he's a member of that gang. - Yes, but I won't ask him. My father was angry about the sick note. I have to go back to work. See you tomorrow. - Sealed. - Let me see. The district police authorities. - The basement is closed. - Sealed. It's probably the last time we've been here anyway. My father says that everything here will be demolished. We have to make a decision now. - And what are we supposed to do? - Sit down. Don't tell me what to do. - Then go back home. - We must do something now. - Only we know that the spaghetti eaters didn't do it. - They don't matter anyway. My father says they're all scum, these Italians. We don't care what your father says. Anyway, we have to notify the police that they didn't do it. But we told them that three young men got the stuff out of the basement. - What? You... - Didn't mention any names. Even though we know that it was your brother. Yes, you can't demand this. Let's have a vote! - I'm in favor of it. - What are you planning to do? To tell the truth. A digger would have that done much better. - Father, we have to do something. - Be quiet, Kurt. I'm trying to think. - There must be a way to help the "spaghetti"... - You're not supposed to call them "spaghetti". To exculpate the Italians and Steffenhagen as well. There has to be a way. It is very difficult to go against Steffenhagen. - And why? - Why? It's hard to explain. There are people... Come on, stop that. Some people always have everyone on their side. No matter what happens. You saw it in the bar. People already start nodding when Steffenhagen only opens his mouth. Even if it is nonsense. Hi, lame ass. You're not that brave now without your bow. I heard you went to the cops? - To report us. - That's not true. You're a liar. The Valiant Little Tailor. Leave me alone. He wants us to leave him alone. I haven't done anything to you. Boy, what are you doing? Egon Steffenhagen did it. I saw everything. I want to file charges. For assault. For assault? No, I just wanted to say that the "spaghetti" didn't do it. You're not supposed to call them "spaghetti". - Yes, that's what we want. - We already know everything. We used the VW transporter to identify the culprits. What about the assault charges? My son was driving... It's nothing. Well, he's probably right, my son. It's nothing. Goodbye. People have seen you pushing him out on purpose. That's not true. - Why didn't you help him up then? - Leave me alone. I'm going to kick your ass. What am I supposed to do with a slacker like you? - I'm not a slacker. - A sick note again? - I'm talking now. - You're always talking. Dad? Good day, criminal police. We have an arrest warrant for your son Egon. There's no need to arrest him just because he pushed the boy out of the wheelchair. He is suspected of burglary and theft. Would you come with us, please? Did you know about that? You have to get behind the barrier. That's what they call "redevelopment". - What's that? - Redevelopment means that everything is demolished. What are you doing here? Egon has been arrested by two criminals. You mean criminal police.
