All in? All in. All in? All in. All in? How about now? All in. All in? All in. How about now? All in? All in. You freshmen had better pop to. You ain't even half trying, neither one of you. Sure no hope for you guys no how. I want to turn around from here, and I want to see two chins well tucked back. I want to see two powerful little chests lifted right u into the atmosphere. What a creep. What a fantastic creep. My, my, my, what a creep Hut to, mister! Sorry-looking specimen, ain't he, Jock? You freshmen seem shocke d by our friendly visit, and disturbed by our continued presence here. Mr. Simmons, do you have any grounds for such an attitude? No, sir. And yet we'd all be expelled if we were caught here. Isn't that right, you insidious beast? Yes, sir. Well, now, you weren't being logical, were you, Mr. Simmons? No, sir. Have you figured out y et who won the Civil War? The North, sir. How dare you come down to our southland and say a thing like that? You lying Yankee carpetbagger. Now, which side emerged victorious in the War Betwee the States, mister? The South, sir. So, now you're being sarcastic and trying to make fun of the South in your sly Yankee way, saying the South won the war when any fool knows the North won. What a conniving character you are. What a sly, crafty, calculating devil you are. d. Let's lynch him, Harol Come on, Jock. You're getting this poor boy all confused in his mind. I think we should lynch hi Harold. He's probably a Communist anyhow. Jock, he don't look like much of nothing to me. Well, remind me to lynch him sometime, Harold. He needs it. You insane brutes rest. We're going to have a little surprise party tonight. A card game. It's been our superb good fortune that I've been able to interest a great wit and a fine gentleman in joining us Mr. Roger B. Gatt. His sense of humor, his courtly good manners his true southern charm make him stand out from the crowd wherever he goes. Mr. Marquales, you're going to win about $90 from him. I'm going to win $90? Mmm-hmm. That's more or less what he has on him. Now, before he stumbles in here, let's get a couple of things straight. Mr. Marquales, you're a filthy ri ch freshman with money dribbli ng out of your ears. You have a Cadillac car and an allowance of $200 a month. But I don't have a Cadillac, sir, and my allowance is $2 a week. You have a Cadillac car and $200 berries a month You're the bait, mister. Rog thinks he's going to win a lot of money off you. Now, Mr. Simmons, this is what you have to remember. You just love football, and your favorite position is the tackle position. "The tackle position"? And you have a great admiration for the town of Birmingham, Alabama. Rog is from Birmingham, Mr. Simmons. Excuse me, sir. Do you plan to cheat during this game? Just a little. Well, perhaps this is a stupid, old-fashioned idea on my part, but I always thought that cheating at cards was not exactly the noble sort of thing to do. Well, I'll tell you what , Mr. Marquales, the money we win you can keep. That'll make it noble. I don't want it, sir. Neither do I. Well then, why are you doing this? Sir, if you don't mind, I'd rather not get involved in some grudge of yours against another upperclassman. What in the world is the matter with you, mister? Don't you even know a joke when you see one? Well, I'd rather not cheat at... Come on now. Jock's got nothing against Roger. Have you, Jock? I'd rather not cheat at cards, sir. All right, then you can just give him the money back in the morning. Now, Jock is just trying to have a little fun. Aren't you, Jock? Okay, if you don't want to play, forget it I'd hate to be a wet blanket if it really is a joke. Mister, of course it is. What in the Sam Hill is the matter with you? Hey, wait a minute, how did this liquor get in a freshman's press, Jock? I put it there, Harold. You don't think I'd put liquor in my press, do you? It's very thoughtful of your mother to pack this, Mr. Simmons. Well, come on now, two bottles of liquor in the barracks, Jock? Mr. Simmons, you're going to be the bartender. Sir, I hope you'll forgive me, but you see, sir, I don't approve of alcohol. I don't care whether you approve of it or not you just keep Roger's glass filled, that's all. Sir, you wouldn't make me do anything against my basic convictions, would you, sir? Sir, did you know that alcohol is the opium of the Western world? Sir, if you took a piece of beef steak and immersed it in a glass of liquor and let it stand overnight, do you know that, that liquor would literally eat that beef steak? Now, sir, can you imagine what that liquor will do to the delicate linings of the human stomach? Now you listen to me, you ridiculous idiot, you keep Roger's glass filled or I'm going to take this broom here and cut you in half. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Hey, Jock, listen. You're not planning on getting Roger really drunk, are you, Jock? Mr. Simmons is going to get him dead drunk, Harold. I just don't think I'd do that, Jock, because ol' Rog fights when he gets drunk, Jock. I know he does, Harold. Here, fix these for me, will you, boy? Roger. We've been waiting for you on pins and needles, boy. Jock. Well, I couldn't come until Laurie went to sleep. Come on in, boy Mr. Simmons here was in a dither for fear you weren' going to show up, boy. He's a great admirer of yours, you know. I want you to meet him, Roger. He is one of the mos t brilliant freshmen here this year. Well, here he is, Mr. Simmons, Roger B. Gatt. One of the greatest football players in all of Dixieland. How do you do, sir? My favorite position is the tackle position. Well, now that's quite a coincidence Roger here happens to be a tackle. What is it you like about the tackle position? Well, I just admire it, sir. Well, that's funny. You know, most people, they like a backfield. Them backs get all the glory. Sir, they do, they certainly do. I like the backfield, too, but my favorite position is the tackle position. Roger, he sort of hero-worships you. All right. Have you been around here long? Sir? Answer the question, Mr. Simmons. Have you been around here long? Since before taps. No, no, no. Roger doesn't mean that He means have you been around the college long. I got here when it opened. I mean, when it started. Roger, he got here when the term started. Well, that's good. Glad to have you around. You like it here? Yes, sir. That's good, too. Greatest school there is. Mr. Gatt's from Birmingham, Mr. Simmons. You remember Birmingham, don't you, Mr. Simmons? Don't you remember telling me how you wan t to settle down there when you finish school, go into the horse-feed business. Yes, sir Or was that mule-feed? Horse-feed, sir There are a lot of horses around there. Lot of mules, too. Shucks, they have everything, everything, everything in Birmingham You know that? Such a beautiful city. All those smelters and everything. Yeah. It's real pretty there. Is that him, the rich freshman? Yeah, that's him, Rog. And he's itching for action You got a Cadillac car? Yes, sir. A Cadillac. What color is it? Brown. Sort of a creamy brown. Wow. Even I wouldn't get caught dead in no brown car. I'd get red. Hey, Jock. Hmm? You know my grand-mammy? You know, well, she won't let me have no automobile. How do you like that, Jock. You know what she says? She says... Roger, you kill me, boy. Man, what a witticism. And what are you laughing at? Nothing, sir. Yeah, well, see you don't. You're a freshman around here and see you remember that. Hey! Well, I'll be darned! Look at that liquor sitting on that table. How'd you do that, Jock? Nothing's too good for my friend Roger Mr. Simmons, pour Mr. Gatt a drink. Yes, sir. Here we go, Roger. Here you go, boy. Drink up, Roger. Okay, Roger boy, how many cards you need? Three. Doggone. I don't got very many chips here. Okay now, Roger, look, you're seeing Marquales raise and you're raising it six bucks yourself, right? Right? Yeah. Okay. I'm light ten What beats three fours? I do. I got a full house. My shako is bringing me luck. It's about time I won a pot. Well, what have you got this time, four aces? No, sir. Four kings. I'll have one more drink and I'm going to bed. Rest, Mr. Simmons. Give Mr. Gatt a drink. Sir, it's practically a poison. How dare you say a thing like that to my friend Roger! It's good for you. Best thing in the world for you. I'm warning you , Mr. Simmons, either you sta rt doing your job as a bartender or you're going to feel that broom. Yes, sir. You see, Roger, Mr. Simmons here is an odd character. He's what the coconut doctors ca ll a schizophrenic. That means that half of him likes horse-feed and football, and the other part's a teetotaling parson who raves and rants against demon rum You take that back. I'm sorry, Roger. Now look here, Jock, I like you and all that, but my grand-mammy told me don't ever make no joke about religion. Now, you take it back. Well, I withdraw that statement, Roger. I'm awfully sorry, boy. All right. Shake on that, Roger? See, Roger? Roger, it's all that schizophrenic's fault. And you know what a schizophrenic is, don't you, Rog? All right, now look here, mister. Now this is the United States you're living in, and you can take all that Europe stuff back where it came from. Yeah, you take that schizophrenic stuff back to Sweden, Mr. Simmons All right, mister, I'm going to teach you a lesson. Now, I ain't saying nothing against you 'cause you're a Yankee. There are plenty of Yankees that's as good Americans as anybody else. Now you look like a Yankee Communist, mister. Get over the press, you Northern Communistic spy I told you he was a Communist, Harold. Actually, I suspected it all the time. You hardly touched him, Roger. Now that's enough. Now that's enough, Jock boy, that's just aplenty. He's going to kill him. An idiot like that is better off dead anyhow, Harold. Pour it on him, Roger. George is next door, Jock. He's right on the other side of that wall. He's going to report us His daddy's got the duty tonight, Jock. Major Avery. And Georgie is going to run right down there and tell his daddy on all of us. Will he, Harold? Will he? Go on, boy. Lay it on him, Roger Lay it on him, boy. Come on. Well, come on, let's go see the Major. What is it? Sir, Cadet Corporal Avery would like to report a case of hazing in barracks. All right. Just a minute. It's De Paris, sir. He's in the room next to mine, beating a freshman to a pulp. Are you sure it's De Paris? Yes, sir. Come on. They were here before. Where is De Paris' room? Cadet De Paris. De Paris! Yes, sir? Have you been out of your room tonight? Have I been where, sir? Never mind. I'm sorry. Go on back to sleep. That's all, Mr. Sully. Yes, sir. Look, Son... Relax, Georgie. Obviously he was asleep. He wasn't asleep, Dad, I'm telling you he wasn't asleep. Georgie, take a bicarbonate of soda and go on back to bed. Please, let's go to bed. I'm dealing cards. ...more liquor. You're not going to have any more liquor. What do you mean we ain't going t o play no more? You heard me the first time. I'm losing. Then you're just going to have to go cry on your grand-mammy's boney old shoulder. What did you say? I never chew my spinach twice, you overgrown moron. You heard me the first time. What's the matter, boy? What's the matter, Roger What's the matter, boy? What is it, Roger? Get him, Roger! Get him, boy! Pop him, boy! Pop him one! Come on! Get him, Roger! Get him, boy! Go ahead, boy! Get him, boy! Get him! Get him! Pummel him, Roger! Go ahead, boy. Sir, Mr. De Paris, sir, would any of you gentlemen care for some milk? There was a case like that about five years ago Some senior smuggled a bottle into his barracks, sipped on it all night. Went out for a breath of air he fell down the stairs, stumbled out on the quadrangle and passed out. They found him there at breakfast formation the exact same way. He wasn't dead. He was drunk and beat up, that's all He sure was beat up. I never saw so much blood. Who'd you think could've beat him up that way, anyhow? I heard somebo dy say he just fell down the stairs Nobody beat him up, he just fell down the stairs. Battalion! Ten hut! A cadet was found this morning unconscious on the quadrangle of Headfield Barracks. Will any cadet having knowledge of the whereabouts or activities of Cadet Avery, G., between 2300 and 0600, report before noon drill to Colonel Ramey at Headfield Barracks. Dismissed. Cadet De Paris, J. , reporting, sir. At ease, Cadet De Paris. What's on your mind? Well, sir, it's about Cadet Avery being found th morning on the quadrangle. The Cadet Colonel said that any cadet with information about that should report to you before drill . Do you know something about it? Yes, sir, I do. It's a little difficult to say, but I feel kind of responsible for what's happened to Cadet Avery. In what way do you feel responsible? Well, sir, last year I was a cadet officer, and Cadet Avery was in my platoon. I was very tough on Cadet Avery and all the men in my platoon. Excuse me, weren't you the cadet who got the punishment order last May, just toward the end of the term? Yes, sir Just to refresh my memory, what was that punishment order for? Major Avery reported me for harshness towards underclassmen, sir. And rightly, sir . I see. Well, learning that authority and responsibility go together is one of the hardest things in life, Cadet De Paris. However, I take it you have some special reason for telling me this. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do. You see, sir, my harshness toward Cadet Avery seems to have given him an obsession about me. It seems... Yes? Well, sir, I don't know mu about these mental things, but all year Cadet Avery has been hinting that there's some kind of a plot against him. That I'm the ringleader He thinks I'm trying to persecute him, sir. Sit down, Cadet De Paris. Thank you, sir. That's very interesting. Does he think anyone else has been persecuting him, or just you? Well, it's mainly me, sir. He suspects my roommate and the two freshmen in the room next door. In other words, you feel that because of the discipline of the school, and in particular because of your mistake in harshness, Cadet Avery's had a nervous breakdown? No, sir, I think he's had more than a nervous breakdown. I think he's had a mental breakdown. Why else would a cadet with a perfect record get drunk and wreck his whole career? What makes you think he was drunk? Well, being found like that on the quadrangle, passed out, liquor bottles all around him. I assume d he must be drunk. Not necessarily. The boy has been injured. Could have a mild concussion, and not be drunk at all. As for the liquor bottles, those could've just been put there. I think "planted" is the term. Isn't that possible? Well, yes, sir, I suppose that's remotely possible. It's more than remotely possible. In fact, that's Cadet Avery's story. But, sir, I was there on the quadrangle this mornin He reeked of alcohol. Oh, there's no doubt that whiskey was spilled or poured all over his clothes. The question is, whether or not any of the whiskey went into his stomach. However, we'll know the answer soon. What do you mean, sir? I'm having the State Police analyze a sample of Cadet Avery's blood. His blood, sir? Yes. You see, Cadet De Paris, now if laboratory analysis shows there's no alcohol in a man's blood, well then, even though he's reeking of whiskey and his clothes are covered with it and there's liquor bottles all around and he's dazed from a bad beating, you can be sure of one thing, he's sober. Well, yes, sir, but if this test seems to show that Cadet Avery was sober, then that would mean some college cadet deliberately tried to make him look guilty. I can't believe a college cadet would do an unscrupulous thing like that, sir. Well, although I appreciate your loyalty to the school, I'm not as much of an idealist as you, Cadet De Paris. I'm afraid that out of 2,000 men, one or two are apt to turn out to be slightly rotten. Yes? Excuse me. The polic e report is here, sir. Fine. Bring it in. Well, that's all, Cadet De Paris. If I want you again, I'll call you. Yes, sir. Thank you very much, Cadet De Paris. I appreciate you volunteerin this information more than you realize. Hello, Cliff. Hello, George. Here it is, si r. Thank you. That's all. Jocko, I'm telling you, bo you're not going to get away with it. It won't work Harold, they said the same exact thing to Robert Fulton. "It won't work." That steamboat won't go. That's what those doodlebu said to Fulton. Jock, now we're going to have to stop joking, boy, because this one ain't funny. Don't you think I'm funny anymore, Harold? You used think I was a real card. Sir, that's the way I got into all this, thinking you was a real card. What did George Avery ever do to you anyway, Jock? Do to me? He never did anything to me, Harold. Well, why would you do all that to him for then? Why did I do it? I didn't do it, Harold. You did it. Don't you remember telling me how you hate Georgie? I told you I hate Georgie? Jock, I don't hate Georgie. When did I ever tell you that? Why, Harold, what a feeble memory you have. You're a left-handed pitcher, that's what you are, Harold. Now listen, Jock. Man, I don't know what went o n in that room last night. It was dark. All I know is that you and Roger beat up on Georgie. It was you and Roger beat him up. Not me. Jock, what reason would I have to beat up Georgie? You got a special order two weeks ago, because.. Because Georgie reported y late from general leave. Jock, I never even remembered that. Yeah, well, whether you remember it or not, it's on the record. There's nothing on the record Georgie ever did to me. I have no motive, Harold, but you do. Besides, even if we do get caught, you'd still be expelled I'd be expelled? Sure. You played cards after taps, you drank whiskey in barracks, you stood by while a man was beaten unconscious. You're in this up to your neck, boy. And if we do get caught, they're going to think you're the ringleader, not me. You said I used to thi nk you was a card, Jock. Son, you are a car d, all right. You the ace of spades, buddy that's what you are. Don't worry, Harold. Come on. Let's go to college and get some knowledge. Who did that? Hello, Jock. You going to class, Jock? Yeah, I'm going to class Do you mind if I just sort of tag along? Four years you've been hanging around me, McKee , what do you want anyhow? Nothing, Jock. What are you hanging around for, you little creepy insect ? I'm just being friendly, Jock. Now look, if you don't stop hanging around me, I'm going to stuff your nauseating carcass into one of those artillery pieces, pull the lanyard and blow you out to sea Jocko, you certainly have a gift for colorful, picturesque speech. You get on my nerves It's awful about Georgie , isn't it, Jock? I mean, that was quite a mysterious occurrence Why don't we put our noggins together sometime and have a little talk about this mystery? I don't talk to cockroaches. Platoon, fall in! Report! Parade! Battalion, ten hut Parade, hut! Special Punishment Order Number 14. Subject, Cadet Avery, G. For drunkenness, bringing disgrace upon himself and the college, Cadet Avery is on this day expelled in dishonor by order of General N.W. Cheney. Battalion, ten hut! Company Commanders take charge and move out to mess! Platoon leaders, take charge of your platoons, move out to mess. Left face! Column left, hut! You're not afraid of De Paris, huh? Oh, no. Of course not. Certainly not. No! Absolutely not. Why don't you go take a bath? Bringing that up again, huh? Can't stick to the subject, can you, Mr. Marquales? Your conscience is bothering you. That's what's wrong with you. You have a guilty conscience. Innocent man expelled, and you're sitting there doing nothing. Well, what are you doing, Simmons? Well, I never said I was not afraid of De Paris. Why don't you go take a bath? I won't take a bath! I don't like those group showers. You may not understand thi Mr. Marquales, but there are some people who are modest. What a roommate. You say that! I should say that. What a roommate. A hypocrite! Listen, Simmons, my parents saved for years so I could go to this school If I was expelled from here, they'd never understand it. And the only way I can save George Avery is to get myself expelled. And I can't do that to my parents And that's all there is to it. So now you're pretending you like the school? But I've heard you say differently, Mr. Marquales. ? He has a guilty conscience ? He has a guilty conscience ? He is a coward, a coward, a coward... Will you please shut up! Don't tell me to shut up. You're a freshman. You can't tell me to shut up. ? The hypocrites are taking over everything ? The hypocrites are taking over everything ? The entire whole world ? The entire whole world ? Listen, Simmons, I've had just about enough out of you. Now get out of here and take a shower. It's been six weeks, Simmons. You need it Please, take a shower. All right, I will. When? Sometime. I'll take one when you get the nerve to report that beast. Simmons, why don't you report him? Seriously, what have you got to lose? You don't belong in this school you're flunking all your classes anyway. What have you got to los e if you're expelled? I'm not flunking all my classes. I just haven't gotten used to this warm climate yet. And furthermore, I haven't even begun to study. And if you would shut your mouth, I could study. The hypocrites are taking over everything The hypocrites are taking over everything Watch it, bud! The entire whole world? The hypocrites are taking over everything ? All right. I got him! You cut that out, Marquales. Simmons, is that any way to talk to your roommate? What's the matter, can't we have anything around here but strife? You know, if the Cadet Colonel heard you say such a thing to your roommate, he'd probably crouch down and lay an egg. Rest. Mr. Simmons. Yes, sir? How would you like to have a date in town with a girl tonight? No, thank you, sir. What's the matter, don't you like women? I simply don't understand you, Mr. Simmons. What have you got against women? I don't have anythin g against women, sir. But I have to think of my mother. What I've heard about your mom, you may have a point there, Mr. Simmons. Let's come to grips with this thing. What do you like? Blondes? Brunettes? Redheads? Do you like them skinny, or do you like them with meat shaking on their bones? Well, I think, sir.. . Well, frankly, I think that spiritual qualities are more important than weight. You like them skinny, so you can sling them over your shoulder and be a caveman? She's little and skinny. She's cute as a bug. I really don't like skinny people, sir. Well, she's not really skinny all over, Mr. Simmons. As a matter of fact, if you catch her at the right angle, you'd think she was a plate of Jell-O. Well, I'd rather not meet her, sir, if you don't mind. You've been a mad, inhibited beast long enough, Mr. Simmons. Well, sir, as much as I appreciate you offering me this introduction, frankly, I can't meet her. Why not? There's such a thi ng as morals, sir. There's also such a thing as 50 million years of evolution, Mr. Simmons. Now tell the truth, Mr. Simmons, don't you ever have any wicked thoughts? Very seldom, sir. You know you have wicked thoughts all the time, Mr. Simmons. You see, I'm wise to you, Mr. Simmons. You're not really an innocent little lamb at all. Sir... Underneath you're a snarling wolf. Sir... So wait until you meet Rosebud. The wolf in you will come to the surface. Sir, I must speak. Well, speak, you idiot. We're not deaf. Sir, I know that there must be inside of you, deep insid of you, a Christian feeling. You're nuts! I'm a Mohammedan. Scoff if you will, but I must speak all the same. May I rise, si r? You may rise, Mr. Simmons. But you can't convert me. I'm a fire-eating Callithumpian, and I intend to resist your blandishments. Sir... Sir, I don't think you know why I've come here to this school. I haven't come here because of its fame as a military college. No, I've come here simpl y to study engineering, like Mr. Marquales. Sir, I think when you understand why I've come here to this school you'll understand why I cannot possibl y meet this young lady that you would like me to meet Simmons, he is going to kill you if you don't shut up. Shut up, Marquales! Mr. De Paris wants to hear this. You see, sir I can't meet this young lady that you would like me to meet because it's my eventual ambition to become a chaplain, sir. Those are the facts, sir. You see, sir, my cousin Horace was killed in the last war. A most regrettable death, quite a tragedy. Horace was caught in the full-flower of his youth. Ever since then, sir, I've decided that my own pathway is clearly marked out for me I shall become a chaplain. Yes, sir? How did Horace get it, Mr. Simmons? Shrapnel, sir. Yes, sir. Shrapnel? Yes, sir. Then a machi ne gun mowed him down and a bomb fell on him. He got the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Croix de guerre. I think you're a liar, Mr. Simmons. No, si r. You know you have no cousin Horace who was killed in the war. Yes, sir . You trying to con me? No. Tonight, Mr. Simmons, you are going to meet Miss Rosebud. Listen, sir, I can see, sir, I haven't gotten through to you. Sir, don't you realize your errors? Why not let the spirit of brotherhood that's buried deep inside of you emerge into the glorious air of love and truth? Go take a shower. Sir, you aren't really going to make me meet this girl, are you? Go on, Mr. Simmons. But, sir, I get very tongue-tied around girls. Go ahead, take a shower I won't! I promised my mother on her death bed I wouldn't go out with any girls. Now that's a death bed promise, and I cannot break a death bed promise. Your mother isn't dead, Mr. Simmons. But she would die if she knew I went out with a girl like this, so it's actually a death bed promise in a deeper sense. Get out of here Excuse me, sir. But are you trying to make him go and report us all? If you make me go out with this girl, I'm going to throw myself off the roof. Go take a shower Do you think demoralizing him like this will make him keep his mouth shut? If it won't, then nothing will. Actually, sir, I'm much more likely to report you than Simmons is. You know better than to do that, Mr. Marquales. Besides, you're not the informer type. But reporting you, it would be informing, sir? You may not believe this but I'm sorry for what happened. Yes, it's true I had it in for Georgie But I'm sorry for him now. I'm even sorrier for Major Avery. I saw that man's face when he found his son on the quadrangle this morning. You really are a con man, sir. If I didn't know you, I'd think you were telling the truth. Hi, Roger. Jock, I want to talk to you I'll be right there, Roger. What happened? Well, Simmons is okay, but Marquales, I don't know. Ramey has already questioned those guys, Joc They ain't said anything. Yeah, but Major Avery is going to put a lot more pressure on them than that. Boy, just don't stan d there sipping water, let's do something. I'm telling you, Jock, those freshman talk and we're gone goslings Why don't you talk to him, Harold? You talk to Marquales. Let him know how you feel. Well, all righ t. I'll go see wh at I can do. Hey, Roger. What are you doing up there, boy? I'll be dogged if I'm losing my killer instinct. Come on up here. At ease, mister. Rest. Them steps are going to be the death of me. Phew! Come on, Mr. Marquales, I got to have a little talk with you. Listen, if you say anything about what happened last night you won't just be throwing Jock out, you 'd be throwing out me, Rog and your own roommate. This is Rog and my fourth year here, mister I know you've just been here a few months. Think about what it means to me and Rog. You know as well as I do , we didn't know what Jock was doing. Do you honestly thin k that I knew what Jock was up to? No, sir. I know you didn't. How can you report us then? Attention to orders, attention to orders. Cadets Marquales, R., and Simmons, M.M., report to the guard room immediately. I say again, Cadets Marquales, R., and Simmons, M.M., report to the guard room immediately. That is all. Cadet Simmons. Yes, sir? Officially this investigation is closed, but my son says he went into your room last night. It's hard for me to believe he'd tell me a deliberate lie. I want to appeal to you and to your roommate for the truth. Did he or did he not go into your room? Well, sir, I was asleep, sir. I didn't hear him come into the room, if he did. Cadet Marquales. Yes, sir? You heard nothing? My son didn't go into your room? No, sir. Let me put something to you hypothetically, Cadet Marquales. Let's suppose that an upperclassman abused his authority to force a freshman to break regulations. Suppose this freshman knew he would be expelled if he told the truth. It would be asking a lot to ask that freshman to tell the truth, wouldn't it? Well, yes, sir, it would. And yet, in all fairness, this freshman didn't have to obey illegal orders, did he? No, sir. I don't know what this school means to you, but I do know what it means to my son. You look like a decent boy, and I'm going to make an appeal to you. If you've lied, tell the truth. Sure, I'll pitch you out of this school so fast it'll make your head swim, but I'll respect you as a man. Well, sir, I would like very much to have your respect, sir. But the truth is, I didn't obey any illegal orders, sir. All right. That's all. I don't guess you can be blamed. Standing there doing nothing How can you live with yourself, you coward? Coward, informer, leper I'll sing Polly wolly doodle all day Fare thee well, fare thee well Fare thee well, my fairy fay ? Marquales, don't you stand up when you enter an upperclassman's room? Stand up hard, mister, and pull your neck back. Now, you listen to me, Jocko I just lied for you and saved your dirty skin. But if you ever put me through anything like that again, so help me, I'll get you , if it's the last thing I ever do. So help me, I'll break your back Do you hear me, Jocko? Yes, I hear you. Well, don't you forget it. Hello, Jocko. Hello, Cockroach. How are you, Jock? Fine, Cockroach. May I disturb you for a moment, Jock? Any time, Cockroach Jocko! I just want to speak with you! This will get you, boy. This will kill you! Jock, don't! Please! I'm serious, Jock! You're a three dollar bill, Perrin Please! Don't! Jocko! Jocko, I just don't understand you. I swear I don't. Sometimes you just upset me so much. You still following me around? I'm only taking a shower What's a cockroach doing taking a shower? Jocko, there's something I want to discuss with you. Now look, Cockroach, if you don't stop hanging around me, I'm going to get some DDT and pour it all over you. Oh, Jocko, give me that soap. There you go. Please, guys, give me my soap! Here, Perrin. Jocko, please! You want your soap back? Yes, please! Here, have some soap! Have some soap. Have some soap, Cockroach. All right. Now, I know exactl y how you beat Georgie unconscious You got him drunk by sticking that tub e down his throat and pouring whiskey in him. And if you try and throw me o ut of this room, I'll go right to Colonel Ramey with the whole story. Now, sit down. Sit. All I ask of you, Jocko, is that you be reasonable. How do you know I did anything to Georgie? I oversaw you. I watched the whole thing from the gallery. You oversaw me? You really are a cockroach, aren't you? No, I'm not a cockroach I'm a creative writer. Well, go ahead and laugh , everyone does, but I have the fire of genius in me I'm sure of it, practically certain I'm not laughing, Perrin. An artist isn't appreciated in this country. Now, here I'm sent by my family to a military school for discipline. While in Europe, with my talent, why, I'd already be famous. Now you may not believe this but most of the cadets around here regard me as a creep. Well, you know how they are, Perrin. All they think about is football and things like that. What do you have in these note books? It's a novel Semi-biography. No kidding. And you're the hero of it, Jock Well, what's the point of that, Perrin? Well, I'm sort of your Boswell, Jock. Every great hero has his biographer. Of course, you realize I've only used you as my inspiration. But it's all here. The facts, I mean. Would you like me to read yo just a brief little excerpt? I'd love to hear some of it. Would you? I was hoping you'd say tha I hope you like it. I do hope you like my style. I'll just start he re with Chapter 92. "The trembling rats lay sweating in their beds "as the footsteps of the Major pounded in utter silence on the gallery. "The hulking beast crouched behind the uniforms "like an unborn fetus." This is the part where Gatt is hidd en in the press and the freshmen pretend to be asleep and the Major comes up to inspect Of course you realize I have changed the names of the characters I call you, "Knight Boy. You call me what? Knight Boy. That's the title of the book too. Knight Boy. Isn't that poetic? Now just let me re ad you a part of this I think I get the general idea. Does this bore you? Oh, no. Do you like my style ? I've worked terribly hard on my style. It's original. Don't you think? There's no doubt about it, Perrin. You have talent. Thank you. I appreciate that. Of course, nobody would ever believe the story, but the style is magnificent. I rather like the story Well, don't worry. I'll disguise it before I ever show it to anybody. This is strictly betwe en you and me, Jock. All I wanna have is your confidence and your friendship Well, you have that, Perrin. I had no idea you were so talented. Well, I'll be around, Jock. Sure. Come around and read me the next chapter Of course, you realize I'm pretty busy, though Well, don't worry, I won't bother you, but I'll be around. Fine. I'll see you later I thought you couldn't stand that guy. Man, I never knew you liked him. I don't. What's he doing in here anyhow? He was reading me a book Cockroach writes. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Halt. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Prepare arms! Come on, Simmons. I'm hurrying as best as I can Look, Simmons, you want to go with me to a movie or you want to go with Jocko to meet Rosebud? I'm hurrying the fastest that I can. Listen, Simmons, if you're not ready by.. All right, that's enough out of you, Mr. Marquales. Just don't go giving me orders. You see, you're a freshman. I don't... Rest. Mr. Simmons, don't you and I have a date tonight? Look, Jocko, don't you think this joke's gone far enough? Mr. Simmons, you be at the Hair of The Hound Club in an hour. And that's an order. I won't go. This is a free country. Go on, get dressed. I'll go with you. You are a hypocrit e. You really are. You want me to have to go out with this girl Listen, Simmons, I'm trying to help you. Now go on and get ready. Oh, I don't want to meet any girl Well, you're bigger than she is, Simmons. You can always punch her in the nose. This place ain't really very cultured This hotly seasoned Italian food gives me a case of indigestion. I think I'll have me a lamb chop. Oh. That's an excellent choice, Sugar Bug. They're noted for their juicy lamb chops here. Don't call me "Sugar Bug." I ain't no bee. I'm sorry, Angel Turkey. Would you greatly mind calling me by my given Christian name? How do you know I don't know your... I don't know your name? What is your name, hon? My name's Peonie Peonie. Well, I thought you... I thought you said you weren't a flower. Peonie ain't no flower. Oh, no? It's a musical instrument, like a guitar, only little. What's more, I don't know what you want to take me here for when we can dine and dance down at the hotel. This place hasn't got no culture at all. Look at all that old sawdu st on the floor. Well, honey, sawdust on the floor is considered very chichi. It's considered what? Considered chichi. You know, fashionable. The thing. Don't talk that Italian to me. I'm an American Jo! Jo! Hi. You ready to order? I'll order, and then we'll go upstairs and get your date. What date? Don't you remember that very cultured gentleman I told you about? The boy I want you to meet? Oh, yeah But I thought you was my date this evening Well, we're both your date, honey. Isn't that a little crowded? Not really. Jo! We'll have two antipastos, and then we'll have a bottle of red wine. And I'll have veal scaloppini, and a nice, juicy lamb chop for the young lady. Excuse me, Lotus Petal. I'll be right back. He wouldn't dare bring a girl in here. They have their shirts off. Oh, relax, Simmons. My two favorite freshmen. And my favorite freshman of them all. She's downstairs. She's dying to meet you. Is there really a girl downstairs? Yes, there is. At the moment she's eating a lamb chop. When she sees a lamb chop, those little white teeth of hers just snap automatically. I guess it's the beast in her. Mr. Simmons, you're looking a little bloated today. Excuse me, but what are you trying to accomplish by having him meet this girl? Be quiet, Mr. Marquales. Mr. Simmons, I imagine that you, like most of us, have dreamed in your lonely hours of meeting a girl who isn't the higgling, picky type. You just treat her like Duchess Poop-a-doop. Every once in a while, toss her a lamb chop. And before you can say "whoops," you'll be known around the campus as Casanova Simmons. Now let's get spick-and-span for Rosebud. Wait a minute, Jocko, what's the point of this? A man has to have a hobby, Mr. Marquales. De Paris, you're under arrest. Well, what do you mean, I'm under arrest? I mean just what I said. Get your hat. I'm taking you back to the barracks. By whose order am I under arrest? By order of Major Avery. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Simmons, we better see what's going on. Come in Here's Cadet De Paris, sir. Thank you. That's all. Cadet De Paris, do you always go on general leave when you're on guard duty? When I'm what, sir? I said, do you always go on general leave when you're on guard duty? I'm not on guard duty, sir. Here's your name right on the guard list I was relieved of guard duty last week by Colonel Ramey, sir. You were? Yes, sir. Oh. Yes. I see a not e about it there. That was very careless of me, De Paris. Well, sir, anyone can make a mistake. Of course. Certainly And I'm sorry, really sorry. Look, Cadet De Paris I got you here on a ruse, really. Actually, I have no busine questioning you at all. But I did want to ask you one thing. Yes, sir? It's about my son, George. Yes, sir? As ridiculous as it is, he insists that you are responsible for his difficulties I didn't bother to ask you about it before becaus well, it's so absurd. Well, sir, I don't see how he maintains I'm responsible for his difficulties. His story is ridiculous He claims that he didn't have anything to drink that night. And that you and some other cadet he couldn't recognize beat him up, dressed him and put him on the quadrangle. Does he, sir? Yes, he does. And as ridiculous as it is, I thought I'd ask yo u about it anyhow. Did you do tha t, Cadet De Paris ? No, sir. It's a feeble tale. Besides, after all, the boy was dead drunk. You can't get around that. The State Police themselves say so. And that makes his charg e against you obviously so much nonsense. Well, sir, as sympathetic as I am to your son, I must admit I'm certainly glad that test was made. It makes hash out of his statement tha t he wasn't drinking. Obviously, he was drinking. If he's lying about that , he must be lying about everything else. There's no way a man can get drunk and not drink, is there, Cadet De Paris? No, sir. You'd better get on back to your date. Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, Cadet De Paris. Yes, sir? At ease. Do you happen to know what a gag reflex is? A what, sir? A "gag reflex." You mean like motion sickness, sir? Now, Cadet De Paris don't tell me you. .. You don't know wha t a gag reflex is. If you put your finger down your throat, you gag. That's right, sir. Suppose you put any foreign object down your throat, say a rubber tube, you'd do the same thing It's the gag reflex It happens even when you're unconscious It does, sir? Yes. Yes, it does. That's how they put tube s down people's throats when they have to pump out their stomachs if they've swallowed poison or sleeping pills. By the same token, you could put something into the stomach as well as take it out. If you had some sort of apparatus to do it with. Come here. Well, Cadet De Paris? Well, sir? This is how you did it. Did what, sir? Poured a pint of whiskey into that boy. I didn't have any proof before, but I've got proof now. Sir, I swear to you, I don't know what on Earth you're talking about. You know very well what I'm talking about. You seem to be saying I put that tube down your son's throat and poured whiskey in him. I can't believe you'd make an unfounded, crazy charge as that, sir. What would you say if I told you that after I found this, I took it to the State Police lab and that the technician there discovered whiskey in this tube? How did that whiskey get in there, Cadet De Paris? It didn't, sir. That lab technician didn't find anything. You're bluffing, sir. Am I? Now let me ask you why you're so sure. How do you know there's no whiskey in there? Well, sir, it's got to be one of two things. Either this is all your imagination, in which case there'd be no whiskey in that tube, or you're right, I did it all, just as you say. Now, sir, if I was such a Machiavellian, crafty, conniving character as all that, would I be so stupid as to leave whiskey in that tube for you to come along and find it? I don't think so, sir. It stands to reason that thing would be washed with loving care. Of course, sir, you could have put whiskey there for the police to find. I wouldn't think of such a thing. Well, it's too late to do it now, sir. All right. But you're no t getting away with this. Getting away with what, sir? You know perfectly well. Cut out the acting, De Paris I'm not acting, sir. You're the one that's acting. All this stuff about my name being on the guard list, all this poop about your son's story being ridiculous. Who are you kidding, Major? You young scoundrel, don't you provoke me . I'm warning you. You want to know what happened, sir? I'll tell you what happened. You sure will. You'll tell me right now, and then you'll go with me and tell Colonel Ramey. Well, this is what happened, sir. Your son got blind drunk, fell down a flight of stairs and passed out on the quadrangle. The sad fact is, he's had a nervous breakdown. Well, if you want my advice, sir, then I suggest you put your son in a sanitarium. He's a very sick boy, sir. It would be best for him to be separated for awhile from you and Mrs. Avery. You know, they say these mental breakdowns often come from a lack of harmony in the home. No disrespect intended toward you and Mrs. Avery, sir. I'm sure both of you have tried very hard to be good parents to Georgie. You liar! Tell the truth! Tell me the truth! You liar Lucky for you, sir, I'm not a vindictive person. You've just done me a terrible injustice. Jocko, that was a magnificent performance. Harold. I think we just lost ourselves a major. What are you doing in here, mister? I've come to ask you and Mr. Koble to meet me and my roommate in the armory after inspection, sir. Meet in the armory for what? To talk about reporting Mr. De Paris, sir. Reporting De Paris? How can we report De Paris? Well, your roommate's Cadet Colonel, sir. We could just go to him and tell him the whole story. Lord, he'd... He'd report us all. We'd... Every one of us would be expelled That's why I thought we ought to meet and talk it over. Look, I... I ain't abo ut to go to the armory, mister, with you. Well, in that case, we'll just have to meet without you. But remember, sir, if any one of us talks, that's enough. Wait. Jocko, he's gonna kill us all. He won't know anything about it, sir. Will you ask Mr. Koble to come along with you? What was that freshman doing in our room, Roger? Oh, nothing, Laurie. He was just visiting. If Jocko hears about this, Mr. Marquales, he's gonna kill you. This meeting wasn't my idea, sir I never told him we should give ourselves up Well, I ain't about to give myself up. Relax, boy, there's nobody giving themselves up. Who in the Sam Hill do you think you are anyway, Robert? Going around acting like a darn hero. I'm not trying to act like a hero, sir. Those are exactly my own sentiments, sir. He is definitely trying to act heroic Come on now, let's stop acting like a Dumb John But, sir... Shut up! What are you trying to do, Robert, clear your own conscience at our expense? Why should we take the blame for anothe r guy's meanness? We didn't do i t, Jock did it. That's right, Jock did it. I don't even know what is going on None of us here had no idea he's planning on doing all that to Georgie, let alone the Major Jock doesn't have anything against the Major any more than he does against Georgie. It was obvious last night who he's really against. Who's he against, Robert? Everybody, sir. It may well be. There's nothing we can do about it. Now is there, mister? Is there one blessed thing that we can do about it? Listen, sir, ever since I come to this school, people have been calling me mister and asking me stupid questions. Now what is this place, anyhow? What's wrong with us? We're letting Jocko De Paris use us just as he pleases, and even now we're going to let him get away with it. Are we so used to obeying orders we lost our guts? Whatever we decide here, I know one thing, I'm leaving this school. I feel like a misfit. I don't belong here. It's wrong to blame the school, Robert. It ain't the school' s fault about Jocko. Shoot, that boy'd been the way he is no matter where he'd have gone. Now, Harold, you know he flourished here like a toadstool in a swamp. School ain't no swamp. This is a good college, and you may not belong here but this is a good college. You know yourself the Major broke Jock of his rank just last year. Broke his rank? A sadistic bully, and they break his rank. Now you tell me why they didn't get really tough with him? Well, I don't know. I just don't think you're right about the school, Robert. I'd be very glad, sir, if you could prove me wrong. Well, it's easy for you to talk because you're planning on leaving anyhow. How about the rest of us Me and old Roger got a lot to lose. Gonna get dishonorable discharges Credits won't be no good at another school. Three years we've spent here ain't going to amount to a doggone thing. I know that, sir. That's why I thought we ought to have this little talk before anybody does anything. Hey, Roger, are you in here? Roger? Laurie? Over here. Here we are, honey. Here we are, baby. What's he look lik e, this fellow? Who? Simmons? Well, now, he's very handsome, and he's intelligent, and he's very cultured. Well, I hope I get to meet him this time. The very idea, leaving me sitting in that cafe like a nun. Alone. If that sailor hadn't come along, I don't even know how I'd have got home. - Don't worry, don't worry, honey. - Jocko! This time there's not going to be any... Jocko! Jocko, I want to speak to you about... Later. Get rid of this girl and come along with me. I want to talk to you about the last chapter. I'm not in the mood for literature tonight. Jocko, the last chapter is going to be gruesome Fine. Fine, you just... You just write it up. I'm sure it will be fine. But I don't want to write that. It's not t he ending I had in mind. Well, you just use that style of yours. I'm sure it will be fine. Curfew's midnight tonight, boy. Yeah, fine. I'll see you later, Perrin. Here we are, Angel Turkey. This place looks fun . I feel like I've been here before. We were here yesterday, hon. I like those old, foreign countries and all this old sawdust d. and all this old, hotly seasoned foo Did you notice that cadet? Yes, I saw him. What do you make of him? His legs are too long. I don't... I don't mean that, Rosebud. I mean the sign. It looks a little nicer here today. All cadets and none of them foreigners. Let's get out of here. But I haven't eaten ye t. Come on. t. I haven't eaten ye Well, I'm getting out of here. Excuse me, sir, but you weren't leaving, were you? Mr. Simmons is upstairs waiting to meet the girl, according to your orders Well, you... You tell him to forget it. But, sir, there's someone else waiting to meet you. Who? Some cadets, sir. Would you like to come up? Why not? No reason at all, sir. See you later, Rosebud. Well, fellows, this look s like quite a party. Am I invited? You're the guest of honor. Sit down on that chair. De Paris, the men in this room and the men outside don't intend to let you get away with what you've done to Major Avery. Well, he hit me. And I must say, I used every bit of restraint refrainin from knocking his head off Who do you think you are , the Ku Klux Klan? If I'd done something wrong, Corger, why haven't I been reported to a regular Honor Court? Because an Honor Court couldn't make you sign this statement. We can. You guys really do think you're the Ku Klux Klan, don't you? Do you realize that what you are doing is completely illegal? Every one of you guys could be expelled for this. For what we're doing to you, we could get a lot worse. You certainly could. I've been abducted in a public restaurant I think you're all out of your minds. All right, De Paris, now you read this. And sign it. Read it! This is crazy. I never did any of this. Who says I did this? Go ahead and sign, De Paris. You're not fooling anybody in this room. I deny these charges, and I challenge you to prove them. Witnesses have testified against you. Now you'd better sign while you're still able to Well, let me see these witnesses. Bring them in. Let them say this to my face. All right, bring them in. These men accuse me of this? That's right. You can question them if you want to. Harold, is this true? Did you guys tell these stories about me? Yeah, Jock. Why, Harold? What for? Don't you remember the bull sessions, Harold? The good times? Jocko, I still thi nk you've got quite a sense of humor, but, boy, you're about the lowest darn creature I've ever seen in my life. Okay, I'll tell the truth. We know the truth already, De Paris. You just sign this statement. Oh, I can't sign that statement cause there's something in it that isn't true at all Sure, Georgie was framed , but my hands are clean. Gatt beat him up, those freshmen poure d whiskey in him, and Koble carried him down to the quadrangle. Why did all this happen in the first place? It was a practical joke that Gatt and Koble and I were playing on Georgie. This was no practical joke. It was a deliberate, cold-blooded plan to ruin him and Major Avery. And you engineered it. No, that's not true at all. And that's why I can't sign that statement. You guys are nuts! Now who would believe all this bunk anyhow? How could I make Gatt beat up Georgie? He's twice my size. And these freshmen, did I hold a pistol to their heads and make them do this? Did I? Oh, no, no. They're just as guilty as I am. Oh, I get it. I get it, Corger I get it. You're trying to get these boys off. They rat on me like a bunch of stinking cowards and you're tryin g to get them off. You don't care anything about Major Avery at all it's these guys you care about. Oh, clever, very clever These men gave themselves up voluntarily, knowing they were ending their careers at this school. Don't make me laugh, Corger. All I want out of you is your signature on this statement right now. I'm not signing anything You've got one minute to sign. I'll tell you what I'll do, Corger. I'll make a... I'll make a deal with you. Fifty seconds. You let me go. I don't care about the school anyway. You let me go after I sign. I'll go tonight. I'll take a train. And you want to make a really good deal? Thirty-five seconds. I'll scratch the names of these men off. . Let them go. I don't care I can see you're more sympathetic to them anyhow And I must admit, they're really not to blame. Twenty-five seconds. Now you must admit, I'm being very truthful and honest, fellows. Now, it's not that I'm afraid. I mean, what can you do to me anyway, except beat me up, or something like that. Ten seconds. I'm not going to sign unless you promise to let me go. Five, four, three, two... Okay. Okay, I'll sign. You see, fellows, I'm scratching off their names. Don't scratch anything off, just sign! Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I'll sign. Now, fellows, I'll go with you to the Colonel and I'll take the blame for everything. Hamilton! Roger! Let's get him out of here. Fellows! We made a dea l! We made a deal! All right, let's go Wait, put that jukebox on! Where are you taking him? What are you going to do with him? Can I come? Perrin, call the cops. Call the cops, Perrin. Oh, I couldn't interfere, Jocko All right, put him in! He knew the whole thing. He never said a word. He's lying. I didn't know nothing. All right, fellows, let's go. Come on, Koble. Get lost, boy. Please, let me in. Let me in! Bye, Knight Boy. Where are you taking me, fellows? you're just trying to scare me, is that it? Why, you... You wouldn 't do anything to me, would you, fellows? You wouldn't beat up a helpless man? I can't believe college cadets would do a thing like that. You wouldn't dare. I see through a bunch of peasants like you. You're just trying to make me crawl, is that it? That's it, isn't it? You want to make me crawl, huh? Listen to me. You're a bunch of stupid jerks! You're nothing! You're nothing! You're nothing! All right. All right. All right. All right. You can't do anything to me anyhow. Nothing. You'll find out the man you're dealing with is a man named Jocko De Paris. You'll find out that my name is not Charles L. Chickenfeathers, my name is Jocko De Paris. That's right. And that name means guts, and brains, and will power! I'll laugh at what you do to me! Let's go. All right, give me the blindfold. Harold... Leave me alone! Come here, De Paris. Get up here. Up against this tree . Now hold him here. Blindfold. Here. Corger. Corger, you call... You call this fair play, huh You call this fair play? You're all a bunch of morbid slobs! All right, hold hi m! Grab his legs! All right, De Pari s, come on. This way. Where are we? Where are we? What are the tracks fo r? Come on, De Paris. You wouldn't do anything foolish, would you? Stand up, mister. You'll all go to jail. You'll all go... Please, fellows, don't do anything to me. Harold? Harold? Harold, I played fair, didn't I? Come on, De Paris. I did what you wanted me t didn't I, Harold? Come on, on your feet, boy. Harold, didn't I? Come on, De Paris. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, De Paris, on your feet. Didn't I, Harold? Let's go, boy. No. No, please, fellows, don't do anything. I don't want to die! I don't want to die! All right, take him off All I ask for is justice. Please, don't, fellows. Please, don't do anything to me. Please. I'll be back! I'll get you guys! You can't do this to Jocko De Paris! I'll get you guys! I'll be back! I'll be back!
