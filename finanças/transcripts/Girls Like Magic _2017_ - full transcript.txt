(slow music) - What are you doing? - Where is my black bra? - I don't know. In the laundry, I think, why? - Just getting the last of my stuff. - What's going on? - Well it doesn't make sense for me to leave it here anymore. Now that we're officially broken up. - Are you kidding? What about last night? - Ex sex is not a big deal. Oh, my God. Did you think that was something? - Fuck you. - We could do it again if you want. I just know you get sensitive. My key. - Yeah, bye. Again. Fuck, are you actually leaving? Come back. (slow music) - Ouch, Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit. (dog barking) Oh, fuck. Fuck. - Mags, Mags. - [Maggie] Hey, thought you were at work. - Well, why are you trying to carry all of this with your little hands, crazy? - Not so little. I've got it. - What is this? - Um. - And what the hell is that? - Uh. It's a pet. No? He was all alone. In a Dumpster. - Exactly, Maggie, she's a stray. We don't know anything about her. Has she had her shots? Does she have rabies or hepatitis? - Can dogs even have hepatitis? - That's not the point. We don't even know if we're allowed dogs in the building. We don't know that they live here. - I can't believe that stupid bag broke. Nothing works in America. - Whoa. - What? - Lesbian alert. - On the stairs, they're doing it on the stairs. (slow music) - See, some things work in America. - Stop that, Jacob. You can't take a picture of them, it's rude. What are we gonna do? - Watch? Okay, sorry. Let's just, act natural. - Okay, right. (slow music) (moaning) (laughing) - God, they're really going for it up there. - What should I call you? Turtle, Kitty, Rabbit? What do you think? - [Jacob] What? - Rabbit. - She's a dog. - Yeah, I know, but she looks like a rabbit. - Mags, having a pet's expensive. - I can get a job. - You can't work on your visa. Besides, you don't have to. It's not like I can't afford to keep you. - Why can't we afford to keep the dog? - Why would I want a dog, when I already have you? - Ha-ha, very funny. (banging) - Who's that? - God dammit, did you just throw a shoe at me? - Just take your shit with you this time. - It's just sex, it will always be just sex, all right? - You're a crazy fucking bitch. - Oh my God, I'm the crazy bitch? You're the one who wrote a song about me and played it front of my friends. My friends, by the way. They're gonna be my friends, I'm taking custody of them, and no visitations just in case you wanna have a rebound. - You can't lead me artistically, and I'll do whatever the fuck I want with your friends. - It would have been something if it was good and not one of your Ani DiFranco bullshit pieces. - Are you done? - No. You're also a pretend intellectual. - Pseudo, I think the word you're looking for is pseudo-intellectual. - Whatever, you're fake, you're super fake, and you hide it behind this hipster musician bullshit, when deep down you're really just a poser with daddy issues. - A, I'm not a hipster. And B, can you just leave my dad out of this? - Oh my God, I wish I could, but he's in bed with us every time we fuck. - Ew. - You still think I'm your roommate? - Technically, you were my roommate. - Not anymore. God, I can't believe you actually thought that you were good enough for me. Oh, what, are we gonna scissor? Boring, vanilla bitch. Don't you dare, that is my good bra. - Oh, is this your good bra? - Oh, you crazy fucking bitch, don't take my good bra? Don't you fucking dare. What the fuck? This was an expensive bra, you fucking bitch. - Wow, it's like the real Ellwood, like for real. - Shh, that sounded really bad. I'm gonna go see if she's okay. - What is it with you and strays? - She sounded upset. Plus I could use a friend. It would take my tally up to one. Two. - Um, what about me? - Three. I'm taking this. And these. - Fine, I'm taking Ambien. I have a pitch meeting in the morning at Universal. - I know. - I'm just so excited. - Wish me luck. - Wish me luck. - Luck. - Luck. - [Maggie] Come on, Rabbit. ♪ Wish she'd die (guitar music) ♪ I wish she'd die (door knocking) - Casey? What? - Hi, I live downstairs, I have cookies and vodka. - What kinda Girl Scout are you? - I don't know. - Come in. - [Maggie] I really liked your song. - You heard that? - Oh, yeah, we can hear everything downstairs. Um, sorry. - This is insane. Nobody talks to their neighbors in Los Angeles. - Sounded like you needed to talk. - She's just some girl, it's whatever. She was the love of my life. The love of my life. I don't even like her, but I love her, I mean it. - You need to go with my grandma to this place in the park. They had coffee ice cream, that was her favorite. - You drink coffee? - Uh-uh, hate it. I like coffee ice cream, though. - [Jamie] That's weird. - Is it? - Mmm. Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. ♪ And we could never go back ♪ We could never back to ♪ Never go back to a boy ♪ Never go back ♪ Never go back to ♪ Never go back to a boy ♪ I wish she'd die ♪ She could die ♪ With a knife Well, if he doesn't want a dog, fuck him. - No. Oh, the guitar, nobody touch the guitar. Sorry. (laughing) It's not that bad. - You're here with no friends, no family, no job and no car. - And no more cookies. - Just a boyfriend that can't make you come. - Shh, he can hear-- - Just a boyfriend (muffled). - No, are you quiet? Good. No but seriously, most women can't, you know, reach orgasm. A lot of women don't reach their sexual peak until they're at least 30. - You've never. - No, well, there was this one time. - You've never. - And you do? - All the time. - Really? - Every time. Every fucking time. - Well, how, how? - And it's fucking incredible. - That's not fair. - Want me to show you? Relax, I haven't been with a straight girl since high school. - What, you knew you were gay in high school? - My 10th-grade gym teacher was smoking. (laughing) - Can I please have some vodka? - [Jamie] Nope. You drank it. - Aw, I know, let's go out. Yes, yes, I've never been to a gay bar, plus I haven't been out in months. Months. - Oh, Anne Frank, doesn't what's-his-name take you out? - He goes out with his work friends, he's networking. - I hate LA. - Yeah, me too. So, come on, it'll be fun. - Oh, I really wish I could, but Casey works at the only decent bar, and so I've been blacklisted for at least like, a month. - Well that's not fair, I mean, it can't be her place. Ridiculous. Plus, you'll go with me. We can go together. - I don't even know your name. - I'm Maggie. - No. You're Magic. Because you just saved my night. - Ah-ha. Ready, three, two one. (screaming) - Rabbit, good day. - What's this? It's just like a normal club. - What did you expect? - I don't know. How about paint and glitter and mesh shirts, and you know, leather, maybe, paddles, whips, chains. Butt plugs, glitter. - Okay, okay, it's early. But you will see all the cliches. We've got the stone butch, the androg, pillow princesses, wannabe trisexuals and the straights, here for their first gay bar experience. - Oh, that's me. - [Jamie] That's you. - I'm a cliche. - [Jamie] You are a cliche. - We can go talk to them. - I'm not sitting at the sad lesbian table. The sad lesbian table? - Yeah, they've all just gone through a breakup, and they come in separately, but then they like clump together. It's like a clump of sad lesbians. - That is sad. - Welcome to my future. - Aw, shut up. - Hey, you girls want some shots? - Yes, I do. - Oh shit, it's you. - Oh shit, it's me. - I'm just surprised. - This is Chad, he's a professional A-hole, and a part-time shop boy. - These are pineapple. They'll make you taste good. From what I hear, you could use that. - I told you this was a bad idea. Let's just get outta here. - We are staying. We'll take two, please. (upbeat music) - [Jamie] Have a nice night. - He wasn't very nice, was he? - [Jamie] He's a fucking idiot. - All right. This is to us. - Cheers. (upbeat music) Tastes like shit. - Yes it does. - Oh, looks like I'm being summoned. If I'm not back in five, run. - Hey, Sunshine, you're new here, right? I'm Misty. - Oh, um, Magic. - Yeah you are. - What the hell did you do to my girl? - I'm not having this conversation. - This is my bar, I decide what we talk about. She said you attacked her with some scissors. - That is not even close to what happened. - Oh, you didn't cut the bra right off of her back? - No, not even close. - Dom bitches with your S&M bullshit, that is how people get killed. - Hey, sweetie, you have really nice hair. - Oh, thank you. - That's a really pretty bracelet. - Yeah, where did you get it? - Hey, guys, first come first served, all right? So, what's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this, huh? Looking for something new. - Oh, I'm always up for trying new experiences. - Perfect. There's a little VIP room in the back I'd love to show you. - Oh, that's so nice of you. Yeah, I'd love that. - What a bitch. - Give me one good fucking reason why I shouldn't kick you outta my bar. - Well, you could try getting your story straight before you go accusing people of shit like that. - Speaking of straight, looks like your little friend is getting led off into the mist. - [Jamie] Fuck. - Hey, we're not done yet. - Right this way, Princess. As you can see, it's very exclusive. - Uh, she's with me. - Oh yeah, doesn't look like it. Anyway, no harm no foul, right? Just make sure you put your name on your property next time. - Yeah. Whatever. - [Magic] What the hell was that? - What the hell was that? I was saving your ass. - Maggie, Maggie, is that you? - No, yeah, hi, hello. - Don, I'm Don, I'm in the writers room with your boyfriend, Jacob. - Oh, hi. - Except I'm a writer's assistant. But I'm in the room. How are you? - Great. - Is Jacob here? - No, he's actually not, no. This is my neighbor, Jamie. - Neighbor, I see. - No no, it's not like that. - No judgment. - No, it's really not like that, tell him. - She's a little shy. - And Jacob is a lucky guy. - Drinks? - No calories for me, please, although I do have Molly. - Who is Molly? - Molly Shannon, she's in the bathroom, I'll introduce you. - Oh, good. (upbeat music) I love you. - Me too. - I love you both. (screaming) (upbeat music) - I love you. (upbeat music) - Oh my God, this is amazing. Touch my chest, touch my chest. - Oh, you're all sweaty. - No, not possible, I'm Asian, I don't sweat. So, you and Maggie, huh? - Oh my goodness, thank you so much. - You're behind the bar. - What's going on over there? - I have no idea. - Hot. - Thank you. - No, I mean you're really warm, you okay? - Oh yeah, great, let me help you. - No, I think I got it from here, all right? Okay, all right, gotta go, hugs not drugs. - But I got these. - Did you bum a fag? - Oh, I don't smoke, but I will bum a fag. - Guys, thank you so much. I had no friends, I mean, no friends. And now I have friends. - You think we're friends? We're best friends. - Shit. - What was that? - Maybe we should go. - No, we came to have fun. Let's have fun. (upbeat music) - You're late. - Like an hour. - Hey. Hey, I just wanna let you know that I forgive you, and you're free. You wanna go, go. Do whatever you want, it's cool. I release you. - You're a fucking mess. - I am a mess. I mean, at least I don't put my crotch in butch bitches' faces for a living. On the other hand, I'm a waitress, so kinda the same thing. I mean, we all have our price, you know. We're all messes. You're a mess, I'm a mess, he's a mess. He's a beautiful mess. I mean, we're all in this union of mess. Everyone here, it's a union of mess. It's like a bowl of mess, you know what I'm saying? - What are you on right now? - Nothing, just like a little bit of Molly. - You need to go home, and I need to work. - No no, it's cool. It's cool, because I'm not gonna bother you anymore, because I'm moving on. I'm moving on, I'm dating, so it's like whatever. - Who? The little straight girl from your building? That'll be a good way to keep in the closet for Daddy. - You're mean, you're so mean, soft, you're so soft. - What's going on? - Hey. - I missed you. - You did? (upbeat music) (screaming) - [Jamie] What the fuck? - [Magic] Are you okay? - What the hell did you do that for? - I was just trying to help, like you did for me before. - That's not helping, now Casey thinks that. - Was that bad? I didn't mean to be bad. - No, yeah. Just forget it, can you just leave me alone for a sec? (upbeat music) - Oh hey. - So, what was that kiss, huh? Thought she was just your neighbor. - Was that bad? She just looked so pretty and was so soft. - What about Jacob? - What about Jacob, you can't tell him. Please tell him. - Don't worry, I love secrets. Besides, Jacob's an ass. - He's not. - Are you kidding me? Don, please don't forget my dry cleaning. I've got meetings at CAA and William Morris and Paradigm and Paramount and Family Disney, ABC. Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious, tut tut, my asshole. - He's not that bad. - Hey, I'm not the one who's cheating on him. - I don't really sound like that. - [Don] You do. - [Magic] No I don't. - [Don] You do. - Let me guess, you're throwing me out. - Clean up. Wet T-shirt contest isn't til Trash Bag Thursday. And drink some water. - Why are you being so nice to me? - Don't want some Indian bitch OD'ing at my bar. I mean, what's with you two? Why this back and forth all the time? - We'll figure it out. We always do. - I mean, if the square peg is not fitting into the round hole, don't you think it's time to find a new peg? - Dude, we're lesbians, the peg and hole thing. - You know what I'm saying, man. I mean, maybe it's the other girl you should be trying to get at. - She's straight. - Sure. She's like spaghetti, straight until wet. - She's got a boyfriend. - You know, I had a boyfriend, too. And now his name is Alice. Look, you know not everybody knows who they are or what they are, as freely and as quickly as you, okay? Give it a chance. What's the worst-case scenario, you get some pussy. (door opening and closing) - [Woman] Hey, Nick. - [Jamie] Thanks. - All right. (upbeat music) - Good. - [Don] You're good. - [Magic] I am good. - [Don] Yeah, you are. - [Magic] Jamie. - [Jamie] Can I steal her for a second? - Yeah, of course. (upbeat music) Hey. - Hey. - Where's your boyfriend? - What boyfriend? (laughing) - That was fun. - Can't believe Casey poured a drink on us. - I can. - At least we taste good. - I can't believe you kissed me like that. - What, I've been practicing on boys my whole life. It's not so different. - No? - No. - What? - You get it? - No. - Get it. - Yeah. (upbeat music) We should find Don. - Yeah. Good idea. Come on. (laughing) ♪ You'll only be just one ♪ You know. - Oh shit. - Relax, it's just me. - Don? Oh, thank God. - Just give me five, four, three, okay, I'm up. Well this is fun. Slumber party, you wanna practice kissing? - I am so glad it's you. - Everybody says that. What, you didn't fancy waking up with a big old lezzer on your face, just lezzing out? - No. - Relax, I wasn't gonna let you do anything you didn't wanna do. Or anything you did wanna do. She's cute, like in a Princess Jasmine Melissa Etheridge kinda way. You wanna grab breakfast? We have to be quick because I have to go to work with your boyfriend. - Oh God. - What's wrong? - I just feel, really bad. - You gonna throw up? - No, about Jacob. - Why, I think this is great. He's a close-minded douche bag, and you're a budding bisexual beauty. You're obviously too good for him. - I'm not bisexual. And it might not seem like it, but Jacob is a good guy. He wasn't always like this. He was sweet, and he was nerdy, and he was fat. - Cute. - And then he got tall and handsome and successful. - My worst nightmare. - He might be a little but full of himself, but we've been together since we were 15. I can't imagine my life without him. - Just because you've been with someone a long time doesn't mean you should let them hold you back from becoming the person you were meant to be. - I am the person I was meant to be. What does that even mean? I should go before he wakes up. And I have to walk my dog. My dog. Where the hell is my dog? - Oh my God, I don't remember a dog. I can't have dogs in this building, so you better find your dog if your dog is here. (slow music) - Oh, hey. Buddy, I'm way outta your league. (door knocking) Come on, let's go see who that is. Come on, let's go. - Hey. - Have we met? - It's me. - I know, come in. - Oh my God, Rabbit, oh sweetheart. Oh I'm so sorry. - You look like the Unabomber. Or a spring breaker or something stupid like that. - Thank you so much for looking after him. I don't really remember what happened. - One minute, we were making out, and then the next you were up a tree with your top off, saying you were the unicorn princess or something. - No I didn't. - I know. I was just trying to see how much you remember. - Most of it. - Yeah? You don't need me to refresh your memory or anything? You look ridiculous in this, by the way. - I have a boyfriend. We live downstairs. Which is, kind of - you know, convenient. - Awkward. - Convenient? - Or awkward. - And you're straight, right? - Yeah, yeah. - There's that. - Well, I mean, I've only ever been with Jacob, and we were drunk and we were on Molly, right? - There's that. - And like, what even is straight anyway? Like you have the straight line, but then you have all these other angles around it, like an obtuse angle and an acute angle and a right angle, and there's no left angle, which is weird. - You're losing it. - Yeah, well, the point is that I have a boyfriend, and I just thought it was a friend thing, like when we all used to get together in school. We'd like kiss in our rooms at boarding school, and it was like a fun friends thing that we did, like. - Really? What kinda school was that? It sounds awesome. - Are we okay? - Hmm? - Because it's only been about 24 hours, but you're kind of my best friend here. And I know that's really sad. And actually quite pathetic, but I'd really like it continue. - Yeah. I mean, friends, neighbors, all that good stuff. - Yeah? - Definitely no sex. - Good, I mean. Thank you. - You're welcome. - I should go. Jacob's gonna be awake, and I need to figure out what I'm gonna say. - Good luck with that. - Yeah, I'm so fucked. Okay. Let's go. - Hang on. You can't go like that. Here, take these, put these on. Just tell him that you took a dump or a run. And that. - Thank you. - [Jamie] Well, babe, what are friends for? - Do you have running shoes? - Mags. - [Magic] Jacob. - I wanted to surprise you. - Oh, me too. I got you coffee. - Thanks, you're too good to me. - Oh, I went for a run. That's where I've been, it's really hot out. - Look, I was a massive asshole yesterday. So I decided to get you something. - What's that? - [Jacob] Open it. - Aw, Jacob. - If you want to have a dog, of course you can have a dog. I took the afternoon off to work on the feature, but let's throw that out, and let's take her to the vet to get checked out. - This is the sweetest thing you've ever done for me. - I didn't like not waking up next to you. Oh, and I also got, this, huh? (toy squeaking) Is it too much? I thought it was cute, but if you don't like it, we can always take it back. - I love it. I think it's adorable. So pink. - I've been thinking, and this could be really good practice for us when we have a little one of our own. ♪ I believe that you're the one ♪ Make me brighter than the sun ♪ And if you ever come undone again ♪ We'll fix you up and make you run ♪ Look inside your machine ♪ Sparks and plugs and batteries ♪ If you dream, I hope you dream of me ♪ Not everything we couldn't be ♪ Because you always ♪ Stumble and fumble, and I'll always ♪ Pick you off the ground, but always ♪ We hover and linger and always ♪ Always (upbeat music) (door opening and closing) - Hey. - Hey. - This is Jacob. - Hi. - Hey, man, how you doing? - [Jacob] Good, yourself? - Yeah, good, nice to meet you. - Pleasure. - We're just taking Rabbit to the vet. - [Jamie] Cool, have fun. - Excuse me, nice to see you again. - Hello. - You've gotta be fucking kidding me. - I just came here to make up. (upbeat music) - So? - I was just checking for any straight girls who might be lurking around. - Good thing you checked the closet. - You didn't stay to watch me dance. What's the matter? Was I making you wet? - I had to come home and wash the pineapple outta my hair. - Oh. And the straight girl off of your face? She looks like a ferret, you know? - You're mean. - I learned from the best. - You just want me now because you think you can't have me. - That's not true. - You can't leave twice and then just come back and act like nothing ever happened. - I said I'm sorry. - Did you? I must have missed that part. - You know I'm confused. - What about? - You, about what the fuck you want. I was trying to be in this whole relationship thing with you, but then you went into an emotional tailspin when I asked to meet your parents. - You met my parents. - God, you are so exhausting. - It's not about you. Not everything is about you. - Sometimes, it's about me and you. (upbeat music) Are you sleeping with her? - What if I am? - Then you, must be having some really boring sex. - This is so fucking masochistic. We fight, and we fuck. - Yeah, it's fun. - Just don't. (upbeat music) - [Casey] What do you wanna do then? - [Jamie] We could try and be friends. - That's a terrible idea. - [Magic] It's just that she's been in there for a really long time. - The doctor is seeing your dog now. It shouldn't be too much longer. - Okay, thank you. (dors barking) - So many dogs in here, you can really smell it. I mean, not Rabbit, or yours. That one, though. - Stop. Do you think everything's all right? - Was your dog in an accident? - We're new parents. She's a stray. I'm sure the vet just has lots of work to do. - Oh yeah. Gotta check his glands and his bowels and his ears. Give him all this shots, distemper, bordatella, Lyme disease, rabies, you probably know about that one. They have to de-worm them, intestinal worms, roundworms, hookworms, bacterial dematitis. That's a real thing, she had it. There's toxicara, giardia, cystoisospora. I'm really proud I can say that one. It's hard to spell, too, but I can spell it. - See? - And there's also parvo, they have to test for parvo. Do you have a small dog? - Yeah, yeah, he's little, just this big. - Parvo kills 90% of small street dogs. I lost four pups just last year. Takes 24 hours, just like that, that. - She really knows her stuff. Don't worry, everything's going to be fine. (crying) (dogs barking) - My condolences. Maggie and Jacob. - Yeah, that's us. Is everything all right, Doctor? - Oh yeah, everything's fine. Your dog isn't dead yet. Just kidding, he's only got days to live. - Oh God. - I'm kidding, that was a joke. We already put him down in the back. Took him out back, boom. Double kidding, double joke. It was a joke. - Ha-ha. - I like to have fun. - You're funny, you are funny. - Thank you, thank you. - I'm just really really nervous in waiting rooms. My parents, they were in a car accident when I was 12, and then they were in hospital, but they died, and I was in the waiting room when they told me, so. - Wow. - My condolences. - That's why I get really nervous. I can't stop talking. - Okay, so, Rabbit's not quite done yet. We still have a few more tests to run, but I can tell you that he is healthy. He's about one year old, and he is a boy. - Oh, thank you, Doctor. He's a boy, I told you. - I mean, is it inverted? Like I couldn't see a penis at all. - Yeah. There's no microchip, so unless somebody comes forward in the next five days, he's yours to keep. But he's a chihuahua, which means he can live upwards of 20 years, it's a long-term commitment. A dog is not just for Christmas. That's what my dad always said. - Or for your birthday. My parents gave me a dog for my birthday. Well, then they died, and so I had to give him up, but it was only because of my grandma because she had emphysema and then, her cancer kicked in, and I had to drop everything to look after her, so. - My condolences. I'm gonna go check on your dog. Okay, I'll be back. - Your stories are kinda making everyone else sad. I'm just saying. - Wow. 20 years. Long time. The dog, lives 20 years. - Oh, yeah. - By the end of that time, I'll be, fuck, pretty old. - Yeah. - Mags, do you think you're ready for this? - Yeah, actually I think I am. Ever ready to share my life with someone, and to look after them, you know? And to put their needs before my own. And to have someone to always hang out with, and cuddle with. You know, I think it makes me a better person when someone else needs me. Like I'm more understanding, and more patient and kinder when I'm looking after another living thing, another person. - Wow. I never realized you felt this way. - And if you don't wanna be a part of it, that's fine. I can always just take the dog, and-- - Will you marry me? - What? - I love you. And everything you just said, I want it too. - Oh. - I want someone to look after me like that. I want to make someone a better person because they love me, because they're with me. And it would make me so happy to be able to do that for you. To help improve your nature, your life, yourself. Let me make you make me the happiest man on this Earth. Marry me, marry me, Maggie. (dogs barking) - Okay, sport, here you are back with Mommy and Daddy. - Great news, Doc, we're getting married. - My condolences. - What happened? I'll pour you a drink. Come on. - I don't even know how I got myself into this mess. I mean, suddenly we were there, we were picking out a ring with the ring fellow and the dog, and the ring fellow is smiling, Jacob is crying, and all I can think about is how long do I have to smile before it's acceptable to not be smiling? And are my eyebrows too far up in my forehead for it to look like a real smile, and how did I get myself into this mess? And I should be happy, shouldn't I? I should be happy, this should be the happiest day of my life. - M&M? - Thank God, I can't fit into a wedding dress. - I broke up with Casey. - Again? - For real this time. - You're so lucky. - Okay, Magic, look at me. Look at me. Engagements aren't always happy. Marriages aren't always happy. And love isn't always happy. That being said, let's look at some of the facts. You've got a boyfriend, cool. You just moved halfway across the world to be with him, that's awesome. He just proposed, it's a perfectly normal progression. And you said yes. Most women would be over the moon. Worse comes to worse, you just break up with him. - What if that's not the worst? What if the worst is we get married? - There's that. - I don't wanna get married. - Shh. - None of these seem right. We need to get one and start the grieving process. Remember? - Jeffrey just fit. - You can't have Jeffrey anymore. When a relationship dies, - So does the dildo. - So does the dildo. - No recycling allowed. - I know, I said it, please don't quote me to me. - You two are buying vibrators together? This is getting serious. - We're not buying them together. We're just buying them together. So, essentially, you were in a throuple. It was never just you and Casey. It was you and Casey and Jeffrey. - No, Jeffrey wasn't always invited. - Well then what did you do? - Have sex. - How do you have sex without a penis? - Seriously? Sex isn't just sexual intercourse. It's anal sex, oral sex. Masters of Sex, penis, no penis, it's the same. It's just, with a women it's more sensual. And it definitely lasts longer. - You two are disgusting. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go look at the bedazzled penis pumps. (laughter) - Wait, so, you've had sex with men? - Yeah, oh yeah. Back when I was delusional and thought I could fuck my way to being straight, yeah. - You wanted to be straight? - It's more complicated than that. - My mom's Indian, my dad's from Iran, and put it this way. Once, my dad said that gays should be hung in public and horsewhipped. And not in a kinky way. - That's not very nice. - No. It's very bad. (screaming) (laughing) - What about this one? (vibrator buzzing) - It's only one speed. He is no Jeffrey, my friend. - Ow. - What kind do you have? - I don't have one, I have a boyfriend. - How's that working out for you? - That's mean. - Oh, you're getting one. It's on me. What do you like? Wide, tall? Pink, blue, teeth? - Teeth? That one's cute. - Perfect. Done, I'll get the same one. When you use it, try to relax. Light some candles, smoke some pot. Do whatever it is you need to do to, you know. Oh, and it needs a name. Because he, or she, is gonna be pleasuring you in a very intimate way. So he or she deserves a name. - Why'd you call yours Jeffrey, anyway? - We named it after that stupid purple dinosaur. - Barney? - Yeah, we got it wrong. - Ta-da. What do you think, too much or just enough? Yeah, you're right, not enough color. (laughing) - Jacob?

(moaning) Hello, friend. (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (moaning) (laughing) - Hey, Mags. That's a fire hazard, don't you think? - Wine? Hello. - Hi. What's gotten into you? - Nothing. I just wanted to do something nice for you. You work so hard. - I'm not gonna complain. - Good. (slow music) Seriously, it's a fire hazard, though. Hold on, one second. - [Magic] What are you doing? - It's a bit bright in here, isn't it? - Not really. - Maggie, we can see everything. - So, we can see each other. Stop. It's sexy. - Mags, we've been together almost 10 years. We don't need to see each other naked anymore. (kissing) - Morning, sleepy. I'm just dashing out. Thank you for last night. It was H-O-T-T hot. (slow music) - Jamie? Jamie, wake up. - How did you get in here? - That's not important. Look, I'm really freaking out about something, and it's kind of a weird thing. And I don't really wanna talk to you about it, but I've got no one else to go to. - Okay, what is it? - I think I have an ugly vagina. - Get out. - No, it's not funny, listen, pay attention. - Babe, I'm sure you don't have an ugly vagina. - Jacob only wants to do it with the lights off. Lights off, I'm talking total darkness. At first, I thought it was because we're British, but then, I took a long, hard look at myself, and I thought, maybe it's me. - It's not you. - I looked. - You looked? - I looked for myself. - And? - And at first I thought it was nice, but then, I saw this thing and now I'm not sure. - What kind of a thing? - Just like a little bit of skin coming out. - That's fine, lotsa women have that. - Then I did some research, and there's this thing called a hood. What? - That's not good. - Why, why not? - Well, it's this small fold of skin that goes over the clitoris, and it's not bad. It's just awkward, and you kind of have to lift it to be able to get anywhere near it. And it makes it hard for women to get off. Which is exactly your problem, come to think of it. - Oh my God, I'm a freak. - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. You're not, you're not, it's fine. I mean, do you want me to? - What? - Take a look? - Oh my God, no. (upbeat music) I can't believe I'm doing this. - Can I have a little respect please? Usually when I'm down here, I'd be romanced a little bit, you know? - I'm sorry. - [Jamie] It's okay. Are you ready? - I'm ready. - [Jamie] All right, now take your panties off. - You're weird. Do you have to be so close? - Whoa, did you shower this morning? - Yes I showered this morning. God, leave me. - I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. Not funny? - It's not a time for jokes. - Okay, hmm. - What is it? - [Jamie] Yeah. - What? Tell me, is it bad? I'm hideous, aren't I? What? - It's really pretty. - What? - It is, it's really pretty. You've got this little mole, on your left lip, and it kinda looks like Cindy Crawford. - Really? - Yeah, it's beautiful. It's weird, I don't usually do this much talking in this position. Did you just get a little wet? - [Magic] No. - Yeah you did. You just got wet, and you got wet for me. - I did not. What do you expect when you hold my legs open like that? - Oh my God, I was kidding. - Oh, my God, you bitch. - Don't worry, I got a little wet too. - You did not. - What do you expect when you've got your legs open like that? (laughing) Do you wanna see? Even out the score, honest. - Sure. (laughter) - It's really pretty. Pret-ty vagi-na, pret-ty, va-gina. - Thank you. - You are welcome. I have a confession to make. - [Magic] What is in that box? - I slept with Jeffrey. - [Magic] You did not. You were supposed to throw him out. - I know, I know, I know, I know, but he just gets me, like he gets me. - [Magic] Okay, release, release. Jamie, release. Release the dildo, Jamie, let go. Do you have a shovel? - Give him back, give him back. Give him back, give him back. He's my friend, I love him. (crickets chirping) - This is stupid, I'm not wearing this. - Do you want to be over her or not? Veils on. - Fine, veil is on, Senor. - Trust me, you'll feel so much better. So, Jamie, do you have any last words to say to your friend, Jeffrey, before we put him to rest? - Yes, Magic, I do. Dear Jeffrey, thank you for your years of service. You'll be missed. - Is that it? - Yeah. - All right, my turn. And as we lay you down to rest, we know that you have done your best. You've been in, you've been out. You've reached your goal, now rest in peace in your new hole. (snickering) - Sorry. - Bye-bye, Jeffrey. - I cannot believe our VP's throwing their engagement party at his house. Jacob is such a sycophant. Oh, shiny. You really think they're gonna get married? How long is this charade gonna go on for? - They've been together a while. They must be doing something right. Besides, you and I are hardly relationship experts. - True, so how do you feel about all this? Magic getting married? - I'm fine. - Really, because you two have this thing going on. - We're friends. - Right, friends. Okay now, just finish your makeup. - It's finished. - No it's not. (groaning) - Isn't this place beautiful? So nice of my boss to let us use it. - I don't know anyone here. - Don't worry, you know me, and I am the best one. And Jamie's coming, too, right? - Yeah, she should be here, I don't know where she is. - Plus, you're adorable. Everyone is going to love you, okay? Oh, it's my agent from CAA. - Go say hi. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - I'll be back in a second. - I'm good. - Okay, all right. - Okay. - John, how are you, mate? - What's up? Good to see you, man, you look like a star, buddy. - Thank you, I try my best, but I leave that normally to you. - Thank you, I look good, right, I wore the new suit. I wanna represent you. - And have we heard anything? - Dude, they like you. They like the script, and of course I'm gonna push it so you'll be fine. You've got me, I'm the best in the game, there's no problem about that. Everything's like in the right direction. - Okay, because you know that's where I'd like it to land. - Are you done? - Just a few more finishing touches and we're out the door. (doorbell ringing) - Who's that? (coughing) Mom, Dad. - [Mom And Dad] Hello, Jamina. - Come in. What are you doing here? - Your roommate, Casey, invited us over for dinner. - Casey did? - She said you needed us, that there was some kind of trouble. - [Mom] What a nice girl that Casey. - Yeah, she's a peach. - You look clean today. Did you get dressed up just for us? - Yeah. - Sweetheart, it is so good to see you. You are beautiful today, look at you. What is that on your face? - Thanks, Daddy. - Who is this handsome man? - I like you. I'm Don. - That's just what I wanted to talk to you about. This is my boyfriend. - Oh my. - [Dad] It is so good to meet you, what a pleasure. - [Don] Careful, this is hot. - My baby, are you going to get married finally? - She's my baby, I love her. You understand, I love her. - I'm sorry, I panicked. - You told him I'm your boyfriend. - Casey's such a bitch. - It's kinda flattering actually. I mean, no one's ever thought I was straight before. And I forgot what that was like, too. - Can you focus? We need to fix you. - What are you doing? - Taking off your lip gloss. - Just because I'm straight doesn't mean that I have to have chapped lips. Fair enough. - Can you butch it up? - Can I ever. - Oh God. - So, Don, what do you do? - I'm a writer. I mean, I started off as a writer, but now I'm a TV executive. - That sounds fancy. - It is. - It is. - Yup. - So how did the two of you meet? - We met at a bar, actually. - Looks like you're drinking too much these days, Jamina. - That's an art project. I hardly drink anymore. - Yeah, me neither. Asian, doesn't really sit well with me. - So, do you two live together? - No. - Yes, no. Sometimes I stay on the couch. (cellphone ringing) - Excuse me. - I love your dress. - Thank you very much. - It's pretty, it's a good color on you. - It's silk, I can wrap it around. - So tell me, the musical, what's happening with it? - Oh my God, it's going great. You know, the last choreography we did, it was like amazing. - [Jacob] So progressive, it's progressive. - Fantastic. - Oh my God. - [Jacob] The things you were doing, the gender bender. - Thank you, we thought that the neon lights were a little bit extravagant, but. - Never. Never, why would you think such a thing? - [Woman] I loved it. - Thank you. - Hey, James, Phyllis, what a surprise to find you by the bar. What a surprise. How are you guys? - Just great, how are you doing? - I'm fantastic, I'll have a drink to that. - You're here for a week, we definitely have to catch up. Lunch this week? - Please, lunch sounds great. - Okay, SoHo? - Great, perfect, you remembered, that's great. - Well you know, I know what you like. Hello, good to see you. - Hey, hey, watch the lips. I'm kidding. (laughing) - Come on, I'm about to be a married man. - [Man] Congratulations on the script, it's incredible. The third act is incredible. - Thank you. - I just finished that movie. - Oh you did, what took you so long? - Ummm. - So like, the phone starts ringing about you before we even get into the office. - I know, it's madness. - And you answer the phone, and it's Jacob was this, Jacob was that, constantly putting calls through. - It's super exciting. - And they're saying my name? - Yeah, constantly lately, like 45 times an hour. - Jacob Wood? - [Woman On Left] You are the hit of the town. - [Jacob] Thank you, thank you, I try, I try my best to do that. - I would read anything you wrote. I would read if you wrote the alphabet. - I just got a text about you. - No you didn't. - I sure did. - Let me see. - Constantly, everyone, everyone wants to work with you. You could name your project, you could do anything you want. It's just like, you name it. Like whatever you wanna write about, you could do it. - Hey. - Oh thank God, where are you? - Sorry, I'm so sorry, you know I wanna be there, but you will never believe what just happened. - Is it bad? I'm kind of hoping that it's bad so that I can have an excuse to leave. Is that bad? - Casey called my parents. She's invited them over. - What, why would she do that? - Because she's a crazy bitch. And now they're here, and Don was here, and so, I kinda told them that he was my boyfriend. - What, they believed you? - They believe what they wanna believe. - Just, just please, please come now. If I hide until you get here, then maybe no one will notice. - Magic, my parents are here. I don't know what to do. - Just bring them to the party. - They can't know I'm gay. - So don't tell them, just pretend that you're not. Right, you don't know anyone here. I don't know anyone here. Look, the only person that you know is Jacob, and I'll tell him what's going on. And he won't out you, I promise. Okay, be quick, I think I'm gonna have a panic attack. Please, just promise me that you're gonna be here. - There you are, I've been looking for you everywhere. - Hi, this tree is so interesting, don't you think. - Yeah, all right, come on, let's go. - No no no, Jacob, Jacob, I have to tell you something. Jamie and Don, they're on their way, and-- - Jacob. - [Magic] Jacob. - Great work today, really funny stuff. You absolutely killed it. - No, you. (sniffling) (crying) - This is a very nice place, Jamina. - Very fancy. (upbeat music) - Okay, you get my dad drunk, it won't be hard. - Your wish is my command. - I'm gonna find Magic. - Hi, I'm so glad you could make it tonight. Oh looks like you found the bar. - [Man] Excuse us. - Don't mind me. - Occupied. - Gross. - You're gross. (laughing) - [Jamie] Magic? - Hi. - What the hell is this place? - You came. - Duh. What happened? - I panicked. You're not gonna make me go back out there, are you? - Not a chance, give me that. - I feel better already. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. - So you guys having fun tonight? Oh he's a little bit of a drinker, we're gonna get along. - Tomorrow, you have a breakfast meeting at NooVoo out in Malibu. And then you have the meeting back at Paramount. And then from there, back to the office, you have meetings all day. - Wait, wait, he fucking did it. Wait, dude, dude, bros. - I wanted it to be special. - Oh my God, it's going straight to series. - No way, no way, oh my God. Hello, everybody, can I get some attention? Please. We have just had the most wonderful news. My pilot, Brit in the City, has just sold to Universal for an unprecedented amount. (cheering) Now, I just want you to know how much I appreciate all of you being on this incredible roller coaster that is my life in the City of Angels. There couldn't be a better time for this to happen than now. Surrounded by my favorite people to share and celebrate this news with. There is one person I have to thank the most. A person who stood by me when I had nothing, who moved to the other side of the world to be with me. My future wife. Maggie Keegan, the future Mrs. Jacob Wood. (applause) Come on, Maggie. Come on, darling, out you come, don't be shy. She's a little bit shy. - And he's a little bit of an ass. (laughing) - Well don't don't don't hesitate on my behalf, guys. Drink up, let's get this party going. Let's go, guys. Thanks, man, I'm gonna go find Mags. (laughing) - This is the worst day of my life, so you don't getta cheer me up, okay? - Okay. - So you know what I'm gonna do on the worst day of your life? - What? - I'm gonna buy you a cat. - I fucking hate cats. - I know, that's why I'm gonna get you one. And then, I'm gonna take you to an all-male strip club. - Ew. Penis, penis, penis. - And then I'm gonna take you to a karaoke bar, and I'm gonna make you sing. And feed you salad. I am. - Okay, well then you know what I'm gonna do today? - What? - I'm gonna make you suck a dick. - You suck a dick. - You suck a dick. - You suck a dick. - I've sucked lotsa dicks. - Ew, gross. - Aren't you the one that's supposed to like dick? - Well I don't. Come on, who likes sucking dicks? - I mean, every gay man I know. - Really? Gross. I don't like it. I don't like it. (laughing) I can't believe Casey called your parents. - I can't believe that you're hiding in the attic at your own engagement party. You really are Anne Frank. - Well, here's to having an awesome time. - Shh, shh. The Nazis are coming. - That's awful. They really are like Nazis, though, terrible people. - And Jacob's Hitler, he is the Persian fucking Hitler. - You can't say that. - I can say whatever I want. - You cannot say that, that's terrible. - At least I made you laugh, though. - That's true. You did make me laugh. You know something? - What? - You're the best fucking friend. (upbeat music) - You're my best friend, too. (kissing) - [Magic] You have such big boobs. Let me see them. (laughing) Now what? - [Jamie] This. - Mags. - [Jamie] Pass me my bra. - [Magic] You pass me my bra. - [Jamie] You weren't wearing a bra. - [Magic] Oh shit. - Mags? (squealing) Mags? Jamie? (slow music) - Jacob. - Jamina? - That was intense. - Yep. Intense. - Are you okay? - You know, I don't know. - No. - No. - You sure you don't mind if I stay here? Just for a few days until I figure things out. - No, where else are you gonna stay? - I'm really sorry about your parents. What are you gonna tell them? - Um, I don't know. I'm exhausted. I need to get some sleep. - Yeah. I should probably just stay on the couch. - Yeah, whatever. Don't be stupid, come sleep with me. In my bed, come on. - That is intense, man. I mean, where's she at now? - At my place. I said I had a songwriting session. I had to get outta there. - She's living with you? That's just fucking crazy. - Well, she was living with her fiance. Where was she supposed to go? - I don't know, but not your place. I mean, this is typical U-Haul story, man. I mean, she pull up with a truck? - I don't even know if she's gay. - She's homeless. Yeah, and you about to have a microwave family, man. You pop that shit in for 20 seconds, and bing, you've got a wifey and a doggie. - Shit, man, she's already good a dog. - See what I'm saying? God damn, well, what are you gonna tell your parents? - I don't know. They won't talk to me yet. - Oh, man. Our people, man, fuck them. I mean, I know it's none of my business, but fuck them if they don't wanna accept you. - They're my parents. - I didn't mean literally fuck them. Look, I get it, they're your parents, but like, man, doesn't make them right, just makes them old. They're olders, not elders. Look, they're gonna die soon. And then you can do whatever the fuck you wanna do. - That's fucking bleak. - I get it. We come from the same people. And you know, you could tell me anything. You know, I do wanna know. Did you fuck her? - Come on, man. - I wanna know, man, motherfuckers wanna know. Everybody wants to know. I mean, they're not here. They're hiding, they wanna hear. - So hold on, are you like a fully fledged lesbian now? - Don, come on, I need you to focus. I'm having an actual life crisis here. - You're breaking free, this is beautiful. - I have nowhere to live and nowhere to go, and you're telling me this is beautiful. - Just stay with your lesbian lover. - I'm telling you, she was acting really weird this morning. It's like she didn't want me around at all. My God, my life is such a mess. And what do I do with my dog? - Don't look at me, I'm Chinese. I eat those little fuckers for breakfast. - I just don't know what to do. - Do you really wanna go home? - I don't even know where home is anymore. Until about 15 hours ago, Jacob was home. (slow music) - Hey. - [Jacob] Hey. - I just came to get the rest of my stuff. I thought you'd be at work. - Not really in a work kinda head space, you know. - Yeah. Look. I'm sorry for the way everything happened yesterday. It wasn't my intention. - To make out with a lesbian in front of all of my colleagues at our engagement party? - Yeah. I'm sorry. - Mags, I just don't get it with you. I gave you everything that you want. You live here with me. You don't have to work, you have a dog. - I don't have anything of my own. Everything here is yours. - Don't give this poor little orphan act again. It's so boring. - That's not what this is. Look, this is my fault. I have no one to blame but myself. But, somewhere along the line, I let what I wanted slip away, and I don't even know what it is anymore. I'm sorry for bringing it all down on you. - Good luck finding somewhere else to live in this city. Not everyone takes in strays off the street. - You can be angry with me for as long as you want. But the truth is, we haven't been right for a really long time. And getting married would have been a mistake. I'm not sure we really even know each other anymore. - I know you, Maggie. And I know, you wouldn't last a day here without me. This is the last thing I'm ever gonna do for you. I'll buy you a ticket home, but you leave tomorrow. And after that, I never wanna see you again. Take Rabbit to a shelter in the morning. - Dad, Dad, don't hang up. Please don't hang up. Just let me explain, last night isn't what you think. That girl, Maggie. She's so alone and desperate. And she doesn't have any family or friends. She's in a horrible relationship, and I was just, I was just trying to comfort her. And then, she reached out to me, and I didn't wanna reject her. I didn't know what she would do. She's really weak, and. Sick. Yeah, it is sick. And disgusting, it is. It's not me. I've never. Can I just come home? (slow music) Hey. - I was just at Jacob's getting the rest of my stuff. - It's cool, you don't have to justify anything to me. I'm not your girlfriend. - No. Are you going somewhere? - Yeah, I'm just gonna take off for a couple of days. Give you some space, too. Figure our your shit. - Well, you know, you don't have to do that. - It's cool. I'm gonna head up to my parents' place, see if I can rectify the damage. - Oh. You're leaving now? - Carpe diem and all that shit. - Seize the day. - Yeah. I'll, I'll see you when I get back? - Maybe. - Maybe? - I think I might have to go back to London. - Yeah? - Yeah, I mean, there really isn't any reason for me to stay here anymore. I don't have anywhere to live, or anyone. So, actually, I need someone to take Rabbit, and I wondered if maybe you would take him. - I wish I could. I'm actually allergic to dogs. - What? - Yeah. - Why didn't you say something? - Well, I didn't want you to stop coming around. So there's that. - Yeah. - Yeah. Uh, I gotta get going. I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too. - I'm gonna go. Travel safe. - Safe travels.

I'm a mess, and we never stood a chance. - Jamie, I didn't mean for all that to happen. I was just trying to fuck with you. - I gotta go. - Is she waiting for you? - I don't know. - Word of advice. If you like her, tell her. Being on the other side of things, it's not easy. You're not exactly easy to read. - Right. Well, she's not even gay, so. - Good, you guys have that in common.
