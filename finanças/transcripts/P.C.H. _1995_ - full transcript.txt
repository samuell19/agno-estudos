- Guess what ? - Today's your lucky day, pal. Found her. That's right, I found her. Stacy ? I know where she lives, where she hangs out, who her friends are. I know everything about her. She's in L.A. When you get to L.A., keep heading west until you hit the coast. Then hang a right on p.C.H. Pacific coast highway. You owe me, man. Mary Catherine, Jill. Hey, Stacy. Hey. Oh, hey, koji. I-I got this new cd rom game. - It's called "killer bees." It's so cool. - Really ? Yeah, but it's for two or more players, though. Oh. Well, that's cool. See ya later. Okay. Guess I'll just be goin' back to my apartment. The state is running out of money ? I had a Grant. Please, give me one good reason... Why I have to take calculus ? It's called the privilege of being a freshman again. Yeah, but I want to be a broadcaster, not an engineer. Everything has its price. You know, I don't remember college being this hard before. How do you do it ? You take classes all day and you work all night. Easy. I have no life. But what do you care ? Next year you're gonna be in med school. Or an overqualified waitress. I doubt that. Maybe I should've spent more time searching for a rich husband, like the rest of the girls in this college. Serena, that, I assure you, would be the biggest mistake of your life. Oh ! No ! Did you throw it out ? You threw it out ? What was I supposed to do ? Was it yours ? It went bad. It was all moldy. What's your problem ? What is my problem ? What's my problem ? I've got no problem. You want a problem ? Here. What are you doing ? That was my hat. So what ? It was ugly. What's your problem ? You need to seek help. No, no. What I need is a roommate with a little consideration for other people's things, okay ? That moldy glob was a two-month study of the Santa Monica bay, which you tossed down the toilet because it wasn't something you could eat ! Like I'm not considerate ? Who is the one who leaves her stuff everywhere ? And who is like a basket case whenever I wanna bring somebody over ? You can bring over anybody you want. I don't care. It's just I think you should charge by the hour, that's all. Yeah, well you should thank me ! If it wasn't for me, you'd never see a guy in this place. What is that supposed to mean ? Excuse me. What is that supposed mean ? You owe me for the hat. Oh ! Oh ! Oh, fine. Fine ! Go ahead. Yes, good-bye. Roommate number 16, ladies and gentlemen. Wasn't she sweet ? No, we take 'em here, we put 'em on the yacht, take 'em up and down the coast. It promotes my club, your boat and all that. And you wanna charge me full price ? No, no, no. Let me tell you something. One hand washes the other. I'll give you half of that. Jimmy, look at that. You see that ? I'm lookin'. I'll give you 650, okay ? We use my bar. No, my bar, 650. Okay, we got a deal ? Good. You see that ? What ? Volleyball. See all those people ? That's right down the road. How come they're not drinkin' my booze ? How come they're not eatin' my food ? We got a beach. We could do all that. What do you think ? I think I'm hearin' a lot of work for Jimmy, that's what I think. You want people in here, Jake ? Get a better chef. Get that "wolf" guy. Jimmy. Like that ? You want something like that ? Right out there. It's a good thing you don't ask for much. Hey, Manny ? This chicken is, like, still flappin' its wings. Maybe you could try puttin' it on the grill this time. What do you say ? I like it when my chicken can actually talk back to me. Don't start. What about the guy on 43 ? Forty-three. Oh, Randy ? To be my roommate ? Oh, please. What ? He's your type ? My type ? Excuse me. As a rule, I do not date guys that take longer to get ready than I do. Are you jealous ? You're jealous ! You know, 43 is a lucky number, Serena. Four plus three is seven. You could own this guy. I feel it. Go get him. Ruff ! Sometimes I think that the only things that matter to you... Are your car, volleyball and... Your Armani suit. One ahi salad and one Perrier. Excuse me. Sabrina, right ? Serena. Serena. This is like, uh, not even cooked. Like, it's not supposed to be cooked. It's seared. Seared. That's right. It's better for you. The triglycerides break down when you cook them. Yeah ? My triglycerides broke down once too. Had to send 'em back to Italy, get 'em fixed. Uh, what is this, a chemistry lesson ? No. It's biology. Really. You, uh, know all about that... Tri-- tricycle stuff ? Triglycerides. Um-hmm. Really ? Yeah. You know, Jess, you might just be able to help me out with something. ** * come in the starry night come feel the bright light * * come to the borderland-- ** Next, we'll have the news for you, followed by the calendar of campus events. I'm Stacy Addison, and you're listening to "morning injection," coming to you live from pacific coast university radio kpcu. She's got beautiful, thick, jet-black hair. So, uh, is she good ? Aw, this one's special. You haven't slept with her yet ? I don't sleep with every girl I meet. Yeah, right. Since when ? Randall ? Randall ! Nice try, Randall. Could we come on back in, please ? - Hello. - I'm Stacy Addison, and you're listening to "morning injection," coming to you live from pacific coast university radio kpcu. All right, who is this ? Larry ? You nerfball. Do you have any idea what time it is ? It is so late here. "Morning injection" ? That's good. I wonder where you got that idea. Huh ? Who is it ? All right, calm down. Geez ! I'm goin' as fast as I can. Can I help you ? Um, "if your... Favorite dish is spicy black bean chili and you're looking for a place--" oh. Oh. No, no, no. You see-- you already have a roommate. Well, no, actually. It's just when I wrote that, I wasn't expecting a guy. I wasn't expecting you, either. Well, now, wait ! Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I mean, um-- come in. Come inside, if you want. Don't be afraid. Come on. Okay, I'm Polly. Start again. Hi. I'm Joe. Nice to meet you, Joe. Oh, don't mind the face. I'm just getting beautiful. Beauty has its price, you know. Me, compared to the other girls around here-- I think I'm getting ripped off. Speak any time now, Joe. Oh, well, come in. Check it out. Make yourself at home. Is it the first time he called ? No. It's the first time he's talked. I think he's called before, but I just assumed they were wrong numbers. Well, maybe it's just a prank. No. I don't know what he wants from me. What do you mean ? Do you know this guy ? Hmm ? No. No. Did you call the police ? Yeah. They said there's nothing they could do really. All right, well, Next time he calls, press the pound sign. My computer program will mute the sound button. And I can trace the call if he stays on long enough. Koji, isn't that illegal ? Only if you get caught. You got caught. In most cases like this, you'd be put on probation. Chances are, you'd be suspended. I guess I'll just have to take my chances. Randy, let's be frank with each other. If it wasn't for the fact that your father is a very wealthy benefactor, we wouldn't be having this conversation. We're putting a new wing on the library, thanks to his donations... And the matching funds it raised. That puts you in a very attractive bargaining position, and we both know that. But you're forgetting one thing. You chose to come here. We didn't seek you out for your father's money. You came to us, and that means we have a deal. We work together, you graduate. Right. Good point. So, here's the deal. Either you get a "c" or better on your makeup exam, or you'll be suspended. Do you know what you're saying ? Yeah, I do. And we're going to send a letter to your parents. Go ahead. Is that it ? There's one other thing. You're going to work with a tutor until you take that exam. I'm gonna what ? Oh, god. Um-- - are you the, uh-- - you're the one ? - Biology. - Professor foley. Yeah. Ph balance can be stabilized. How ? I give up. How ? You didn't read the chapter, did you ? Mmm, what's a chapter ? How to expect to pass a makeup exam... If you don't read the chapter ? Let's drive somewhere. Aren't you tired of this place ? How did you get this far in life without opening a book ? We can go to Jake's, grab a beer, watch the sunset. Do you realize for every one like you, there must be... A hundred people who would die to go to this college ? What do you mean, like me ? Like someone who doesn't appreciate an opportunity. I appreciate it, believe me, I appreciate it. If I wasn't here, I'd be at some Ivy league school, and that would totally be a waste of space. Then why are you here ? Same reason as you. Punch my ticket, get a degree. Can't work for my pop without it. That's not right, Randy. Serena, chill. Look at the big picture. It's all about money. Countries go to war over money. I can assure you, if the shoe was on the other foot, you'd be exactly like me. Still, you can't go through life paying people to take your tests, Randy. I don't always do that. Sometimes I don't have to pay at all. We're done. No ? Over here ! It's me ! - Set it up. - Angle, angle, angle ! Set it up ! Nobody-- nice one ! Oh, yeah ! You'd only have to play one game. A one-time challenge match. A four-member coed team. We'll take on a team from south beach. I'll get some sponsors, we'll put up some prize money. What do you say ? I don't need the money, Jake. I know that. I checked you out a long time ago. I don't know. I haven't done anything like this in so long. I only play for fun, not like these guys you're talking about. They're serious. Who says you gotta play good ? The fact that you've been on every cover of every magazine gets me cable coverage. But... That's the point, Jake. I don't want the coverage. I didn't come here to be seen. Listen. Throw a stick down the beach. You'll get 12 gorgeous girls who would just love to play Charlie's angels for you. That's a great idea. That's really a great idea. The only difference is, none of them made it to the top of the fashion world... Only to disappear. I didn't disappear. I had to quit. Hmph-- disappear, quit, whatever. If I've insulted you, I'm sorry. I just thought you'd like to throw a team together for me, that's all. You hear what I'm sayin' ? I know exactly what you're saying. I dress up and perform for you. You make lots of money, then I'm supposed to owe you something. It could work both ways. Let me think about it, okay ? Thanks for the coffee. I've been around a lot of winners, Stacy. It's always the ones that come so close that fascinate me. How do you put all that behind you ? Hey ! Whatcha eatin' ? A veggie sandwich. Ohh ! Excuse me. Sorry. Joe, I gotta tell you something about your veggie sandwiches. I'm getting tired of them already. Is that bad to say ? I'm serious. You're so healthy. You have to loosen up. Life's too short for tofu. I'm not a tofu nut. I just like to eat well. That's just how we do it in my family. I bet you're a health major-- a "physical" something. No, I'm a psychology major, actually. Psychology ! Tell me what you thought of me when I first opened the door. What did you think ? First thought. I thought you were extremely short. That is-- what is it with the height thing ? I don't know. I'm not makin' fun of you just 'cause you're tall. I'm not tall. I'm physically challenged, that's all. You're sexually frustrated, is what you are. Okay, we're not going there. I'm an oceanography major. Really ? Mm-hmm. Soon to be called "history of the world's toilet." Is it that bad ? No. That's crossing boundaries. You have a lot of pent-up frustrations. You, you don't know that's what the problem is ? Joe, it's all-- I gotta tell you something. Okay ? You don't sense that ? Shh. Okay ? Oceans are like our last chance, and once we screw that up, it's over. I'm sorry. Did I say something funny ? No, I would have never pegged you as the "save the whales" type. Really ? Really. So what would you have pegged me for, Mr. Joe ? I don't know. Something much less serious. "Something less serious." Hmm. Maybe he was just making an observation. That shows he's insightful. Yeah. He wasn't critical. That shows he's sensitive. Okay. Forty-eight hours, no arguments. This is good. Yeah, this is good. As you can see here, there's two schematic drawings: One of an animal cell, one of a plant cell. And like the animal cell, the plant cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane and contains a nucleus. Ribosomes-- a lot of the same stuff. Look how interesting this is, how these two things correlate so much. The nucleus controls protein synthesis in the cytoplasm... By sending molecular messages in the form of r-n-a. Look at the differences between the cell walls. * beneath my hands and fingers * * caught between his life stone * * and gasping for each breath * * and my body's not my own * ** * I recall your stylish whisper * * the siren's call that takes me home * * softly close and I surrender * * making thoughts I can't disown * * my soul is naked * * my body's sacred * ** * my body's sacred sacred * * traces, traces, traces * * traces alone ** There are options, Serena. Like what ? I've scoured every Grant, every scholarship. I have taken out loans, all for what ? I don't know. We'll find something. There are ways. There are things we can do. There's gotta be something-- you don't understand, Stacy. You don't know what it's like to, to-- I've worked for three and a half years here, and I'm already established in this premed program. And all of a sudden they want to take my scholarship away ? It's absurd ! It doesn't make sense ! I don't know what to do. I gotta go. Serena ? We'll work it out. Hello ? - Hello ? - Hi, Stacy. Who is this ? Come on, Stacy. You know who this is. What do you want ? I just wanna talk. I wanna let you know that I understand now. I don't blame you for anything you did. Where are you ? That's not important, is it ? Look, Stacy, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you so late. We'll talk about this later, okay ? Hello ? Hello ? ** Becky, honey, you ready ? - Mm-hmm. Almost. - Everyone's here, darlin'. ** ** Becky, you can give him your hand now. * when in silence lingers * * precious soul I long to feel you again * * if you go let you win * * would something stand between us forever * * just close your eyes and dream out loud * * take you far * * faraway from the start ** look, there's a California sign ! Aren't you excited, baby ? Sit up here with mommy. Baby, look at that ! Look at that. We gotta take a picture to remember this, angel. Are you ready, baby ? Say "cheese." Cheese ! Whoo ! We're free, baby ! We're here ! Yee-haw ! We're in California ! Isn't this exciting ? What's happening ? Morning ! What is that ? We got peaches, mangoes, boysenberries and lots of yogurt. Where's the coffee ? I don't drink coffee. But there's plenty here for you, sunshine. I'd rather have warts. What ? Come here. Try it. You might like it. I wish-- easy, speedy. Trash can. Oh, thanks. Would you please get away from me with that ? What is that ? I don't understand how you can drink that. Definitely not a morning person. Me ? Uh-uh. Come see me around midnight. I'm peaking right as my shift ends. It's a beautiful thing. So, I've never understood how people can eat like that. This is good for you. Good for your skin. White and bubbly. -Look at my skin. I'm radiating. -Joe, let me tell you something. My grandfather lived to be 100 years old, and he thought that fatty meats and fried foods were two of the five basic food groups. Oh, god. He did ! And you know what ? I tend to agree with him. Every single time I've bought something that says "fat free," turns out to be "taste free." Fat-free, cholesterol-free, sugar-free, sodium-free-- I'll give you free. Let me tell you something about free. Here's a free piece of advice. Try munching on some cardboard. That has about as much taste as the stuff you're about to eat. Here's mama's milk, okay ? There we go. What this means is, I either have to take a year off and work... Or I have to go to another university that doesn't have as good a premed program... As the one that I'm already in and I love. And i-- I don't know what to do. You want your old room ? Your brother don't come home no more. Is that what you want me to do ? Just give up ? No, mija, that's not what I mean. I, I just don't know what to say to you. Mama, you're not gonna get any better if you keep smoking. Did you bring me that prescription ? You don't need a prescription. Serena, don't look at me like that. I can't sleep no more. It's not like I do this on purpose. Where's papa ? ¿ Quien sabe ? I can just imagine what he'd say. Your father worries about you. He'd say, "come home." He'd say, "I told you so." You two-- you're just like he was-- so sure you could rise above things. And now you're facing the same things he faced. Well, maybe now you can understand your papa better. Mama, it's a budget thing, it's not racial. Serena. It is ! Next time, you bring me that prescription, okay ? Si, mama. Okay, Johnny. Let's go do this again, baby. All right ? Nice, isn't it ? Can I help you ? Yes, I'm lookin' for Jake. I'm here to audition. I'm a singer. He won't be back for a while, but if you want to rehearse, be my guest. That's awfully nice of you. Are you sure you don't mind ? I don't mind. I got a pretty good ear for what he likes. Can she sing ? Yeah. * I will never forget * * all the things that you've done for me * * the way your heart was set * * to always believe in me * * everything that I know * * I've learned from you * * but there's just one thing * * I'm asking you to do * * if you could only know * * how much you mean to me * * but now I know * * that I've got to make you see * * you don't know how much * * I care for you * * these feelings that I hold * * deep inside my heart * * you don't know how much * * I care, I care for you * * there's nothing in our lives * * that could ever tear us apart * * apart ** Nice number, really. Beautiful. You didn't like it, did you ? No, I really liked it. I'm telling you. It was good. He already has a house band. Where you goin' ? Let me make some calls. I don't need this. I've been in every dive in this town. I've been livin' in places I wouldn't even let my own dog live in. What are you lookin' for ? All I want to do is put a roof over my head. - I'm not askin' for much. - Listen, I got an idea. You need a place to stay. - I'm not that kind of girl. - I'm not that kind of guy. It just happens to be I own the condos next door and this club. You need a place to stay, I'll put you up. Go unpack and come back at 9:00. Really ? You mean it ? - Thank you, um-- - the name's Jake. Jake. You're Jake. Oh, my god. Jake. I'll see you later. Thank you so much. I'll see you at 9:00. Okay, bye-bye. Hi, honey. Where's your mommy ? Johnny, where'd you go ? Right here. There you are ! Runnin' off ! Hi ! I'm Becky. We're just movin' in. Hi. Welcome to the building. I'm Stacy. I'm on the second floor. And this must be Johnny. Say hi, Johnny. - This is your new neighbor, baby. - He is so cute. Hey, listen, if you ever need a baby-sitter, I'd be more than happy to help. That is so nice. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Ladies. Hey, Randy. Party tomorrow night, semiformal, my place, lots of rich guys. Well, thank you. Hold on. What's the occasion ? Uh, when you figure one out, let me know. We gotta get goin'. We gotta finish unpackin'. Say bye-bye. Bye. It was so nice meetin' you. Have a great day. Ooh. Hi, Randy. Come on in. Hello ! The party can begin ! What's up ? It was so sweet of you to invite a new girl in town to your party. Thank you so much. You're not new in town anymore. Hi ! How ya doin' ? Where's your little boy ? Oh, he's in good hands. - Gin ! - Gin ? You got gin ? Who taught you this game ? Thank you for the dress. You lost ? Why don't you come to the party ? That's okay. Look, Serena, I think I gave you the wrong impression. Forget it, Randy. It doesn't matter. Yeah, I think it does. The truth is-- I mean-- if you don't want to help me, that's your choice. But if you think I'm not worth it, you're wrong. And if I don't pass this semester, I'm, uh-- I'm really screwed. Not that any of this should matter to you. Randy, we all have our problems. And we all deserve second chances. But some things you have to work out on your own. By the way, I finally read that chapter. More than you'd ever want to know about... Enzymes, ph balance and catalysts. I'll tell you about it sometime. Hey. Hey, Johnny. You wanna play ? Let's make a road. My god ! Oh, no ! - No ! - Stacy. Oh, god ! Let me go ! Let me go ! - Stacy, stop it ! Stop it ! - What's going on ? What's the matter ? Oh, no, please ! He's here ! Relax. Look ! Look ! In the drawer ! Please, can I go now ? Yeah, let's go outside and get some air, okay ? Okay. Mr. Mondello, this fits the classic behavior of an obsessed stalker. Probably watched, waited, came in the balcony. We got his prints on the railing, glass door, the drawer. Got an idea who this guy is ? We won't know until we send it to the lab. As soon as we get a match on the prints, we'll get back to you. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Come here, koji. You see this ? Know what I want you to do with this ? You find him for me, okay ? Yeah, I'll try. Jake ? Stacy. Everything all right ? Yeah. You have any more problems ? No, no. And, uh, thanks again. Everything's fine. Not till we catch this guy. I feel terrible about what happened. I'm putting on a security patrol until I get this new system installed. It's not your fault, Jake. What's the matter ? You didn't sleep, did you ? No, no. Um, I've been thinking, you know, about your offer. Volleyball and everything ? Yeah. Did you hear we got cable coverage ? I got sponsors putting up prize money to go to charity. It's gonna be great ! Yeah, I bet. Uh, but that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Um-- I probably shouldn't play in the game, you know, under the circumstances and everything. Who knows what this nutcase is up to, and I don't want to endanger anybody you know ? I can't blame you. We'll find somebody else. I just thought it might be nice for you, that's all. But, uh, if you'll let me, I'd still like to put the team together. I know a couple locals that would do it. And there's this new guy in the building. Somebody said he was all-American at Northwestern in six-man. So all you need is a fourth, really. - You okay ? - Oh, yeah. Fine. You know Jake, right ? He owns the condo. Suntan, slick hair. Yes, and he owns a club and wants this game. Hey, Randy. You know Joe ? Hey. Nice to meet you. What's up ? Here comes our other player. Maybe we should get started. Ah. Let's go, Joe. What ? You didn't tell me he was gonna be here. You didn't ask. Get it, get it ! Ohh. Okay ! Whoo ! Heh-heh ! * when I was young I believed in everything * * I turned my ragman into king * ** * with a Laurel crown and a velvet robe * * in my imagination there's a world no one could touch * * no, I had a fascination * * for little things that don't mean much, now ** You all by yourself ? Yeah. What a surprise, huh ? The bar's closed. Actually, I, uh, just wanted to thank you for all your help. I didn't do anything. Yeah, you did. My makeup exam is next week. Good luck. I still don't know how you do it-- waitressing, studying and being on the team. Why does everybody ask me that ? You just don't become a pediatrician without working. Is that what you want to do ? They need 'em where I'm from. You'll be a good one. If I ever finish premed. Why wouldn't you ? My scholarship was cancelled, so I've been looking for a place to transfer to next semester. But everything's full... Or way too expensive. You don't know of any openings in premed, do you ? No. I'm really sorry to hear about that. It's all right. I'll find something. I promised Jake I'd close before 1:00, so-- can I wait for you ? It's been a little weird... Since that guy broke in. Yeah. I'll walk you home. Sure. What were you doing in New York, anyway ? Um, my dad was there for a fight. Fight ? Why ? Well, that was actually the night he beat Cox for the title. No way ! Shut up ! That is your father ? Yeah. You are much better looking than he is. Thank you. You're welcome. I do my best to avoid large, funky men... Beating about my head, if it all possible. Must have a hard head, your father. You have no idea. Look. A beautiful summer night in California. Whoever thought I'd be here looking at the moon on the water... With you ? Why not ? Well, I'm from Brooklyn, for one thing, and-- and-- and you're not Jewish. What, you can't walk on the beach with goyim ? Kind of. That's-- you know what, mister ? No one has ever made me a fresh-- a fresh fruit smoothie before. Oh, yeah ? Really. Oop ! Oh ! Oh, my god. I'm a klutz. Um, why don't we go home, Polly ? No, I don't wanna go home. You sit with me. Come on, it's nice. Oh, see ? Isn't this nice ? Look at the water. Hey. Whoo ! Um-- why don't we go home, Polly ? Come on. No. Why do you have to be such a nice guy, Joe ? Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Made you some coffee. - Polly, listen, i-- - listen, i-- no, me first. Okay. Okay, I'm just gonna talk. Okay, listen. Let me guess. You've got a killer babe back home, and you're afraid I'm gonna hang myself or something, right ? How do you know ? I've been through this before. No, it's nothing like that. I don't have a girlfriend. I haven't had a girlfriend in a long time. Really ? I don't think I'll have one... In the future, either. Really ? Why ? It's not my preference. Oh. Oh. Oh, well-- wow ! Well, in a strange way, I take comfort in the fact that not only are you turning me down, but every other female on the planet as well. Wow. So, um, how does your dad deal with, you know, your, um-- I don't think he could handle it. He doesn't know ? No. Don't you think you should tell him ? You don't know my father. No, Joe, I don't, but that's like the-- I'm sorry. It's none of my business. But, um, don't you think it's better to have a tough relationship based on honesty... Than a no-hassle one based on bullshit ? Well, yeah. Why don't you add world peace while you're at it ? Okay, I'm sorry. But, you know what I mean. I just-- I just think that anyone with a heart would... Find it really easy to love a guy like you. Don't roll your eyes at me ! God ! I can be mushy. Jesus, koji ! You scared me half to death ! Sorry. A good way to get killed ! Sorry. I guess you didn't hear me. I don't have time for your computers right now, koji. Does the name Daniel St. germain ring any bells ? You're receiving calls from his cell phone. And his prints match the ones found in your apartment. Listen, Stacy, if there's something that you need to talk about, you can trust me. You're like the only person around here who even talks to me. I would like for you to think of me as a friend. I do, koji, and you are, and-- I owe you an explanation. A sixteen-year-old girl... Grows four inches in one year. Now she's a complete outcast. A total misfit. Taller than anybody in her class, including the guys. So she takes up sports and acting. Anything... Just to try and fit in. And then one day, her yearbook picture catches the eye of this magazine publisher... Looking for the next "supermodel." Daniel. I wasn't a misfit after that. Campaigns and endorsements started coming in. There were lawyers and agents, and contracts and deals ! And, oh, it was so much ! Daniel decided... He wanted to manage me, and I was thrilled ! He was talented and connected and so charming. You know, he gave me this self-confidence. He made me feel like I was just as special as any of those other girls. And I guess I needed that. Everything was fine as long as I followed orders. But then I grew up... And he changed. And then one day... He decided that my job in life was to give him a son. So he started turning down offers. I mean, koji, chances of a lifetime ! I was this close to really proving that I had it, that I was just as good as anybody out there, that I wasn't just another one of Daniel's girls. Maybe that's what he was afraid of. I don't know. But when I figured out what he was doing, I just left. I ran away, no good-byes. And now he wants you back. Mm-hmm. And he's not a very nice person when he really wants something. Thank you. This what you wanted ? Yeah. Yeah. What's your name ? Johnny. Johnny. You know what my name is ? Yeah. Daniel. Daniel. So I'm on my way home from Japan... And your mother calls me. Said on my way back to New York, I should come see you. Something about a letter from the school ? Care to explain ? I, uh, I was flunking this class... So I had someone take a midterm for me. I got caught. We both know what that's all about, don't we ? You don't want to be here anymore ! I don't know if that's true. Of course it's true. You're over this, aren't you ? You could spend the rest of your life... On the beach once you finish school ! That's not why I'm here. Then, for god's sake, come back and go to an Ivy league school ! At least then I'd feel I was getting something for my money. I told you to get a degree, not a suntan. Randy, come home. Spend weekends with us. Dad, I don't want the yachts... Or the horses. I feel needed here. You see, I'm on this volleyball team and-- y-you're on a... what ? I, I knew you wouldn't understand. Son, haven't you had enough of this ? I have. I'm tired of this school shaking me down for money every time I turn around ! Then don't give it to 'em ! How long do you think you'd last here without my donations ? What do you mean ? Do you think it's just a coincidence that you lose interest in things... The moment you realize that hard work is involved ? First you wanted to be a pilot. Then you wanted to be a singer. Then you wanted to play baseball. I'd have more respect for you if you just came out and said it to my face ! Said what ? That you don't want to finish college. Because that means you'll have to come and work for me, which means you'll have to come to work, period ! I don't have to work for you if I don't want to. Then what are you gonna do ? You think you're gonna sponge off me the rest of your life ? You're wrong. I didn't break my ass for the last 35 years in this business... To see you play me for a sucker ! I, uh-- I don't know what I want to do with my life yet. If that frustrates you, then join the club, 'cause it frustrates the hell out of me too. There is one thing I know for sure. I never want to be like you. Fine. But when your tuition runs out, and you're tired of volleyball, and you decide that working for the old man isn't such a bad idea, I'm gonna remember what you just said, and you're gonna regret it. I feel sorry for you, son. Go ahead, throw away the visions of what your life could've been. You're about to find out what hard work really is. You're early. Yeah, you said you wanted to see me, so... Let's get it over with. What's the verdict ? Your test results are in the mail. That's not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about you. Me ? What's there to talk about ? I'm gonna flunk your class. You're going to have to put me on probation. My tuition's gonna run out, and I'm gonna fail as predicted. What do you mean, your tuition is going to run out ? My old man cut me off. He wants to, uh, buy me a degree from Princeton or Harvard, and I don't want to go. Why ? If I can't pass bio 101 here, I wouldn't even last a week there. It wouldn't be any harder than it is here. It's just another school. I don't want to be like him, and he-he hates me for it. And that makes you a failure ? Yes. 'Cause he's accomplished everything he set out to do. - And wh-what have I done ? - Nothing ? That's right. Why ? Because I don't care about all that. It's not me. - And whose problem is that ? - You're supposed to care about it, aren't you ? I mean, he-he would never understand why... I wouldn't have the same goal, ambition he had. If you think I'm ever-- if he's ever going to forgive me for that-- what ? Maybe it's... Not him that has to forgive me. What have you done that's so unforgivable ? I just always assumed that... Nothing I'd ever do would ever be good enough for him. I never gave myself a chance to succeed. I, uh, I kind of sabotaged myself. That's possible. Is this kind of why you wanted to talk to me ? I think so. Good. Good. Serena ! Hey. How was your test ? Oh... I don't know. I, uh, guess I did all right. I got a 95. My god, that's great ! Congratulations ! It's not too bad, huh ? You aced it. I, uh, I got you something. It's not much. If you don't like it, we can always return it. This isn't necessary, Randy. I know, but, uh, it's the least I could do. It's very nice. I just-- I can't take this. Why ? It wouldn't look good on me. I just get this feeling that it's a replacement-- a way for you to say things without having to say them. I don't need a dress, Randy. Especially one that I've seen on someone else. I need to hear you tell me what this means. How can I when i-- I can't even say it to myself ? Contrary to what some people think, talk is not cheap, Randy. Serena, you know, I didn't have to take this test. You know, I-I could've skipped it, blown this whole place off... And-and I'd be on some yacht somewhere right now. I'd still graduate, and I'd still have that job waiting for me. But I'd never see you again. I feel like I'm a whole new person when I'm with you. And if I let that go, I'll never know who that person is. You didn't see me as a trophy for your ego or, uh-- or even a meal ticket for a trust fund. You saw me for me. And that's why I wanted to get you something. There. I said it. So, uh, you, uh, go on your way, and... I'll just go. That wasn't so bad, was it ? You have no idea. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a split decision. The winner and still champion-- I don't know. Five, maybe ten years. I always knew. I think this is bothering you so much because you're the heavy-- Well, let me fin-- this has got nothing to do with you ! Why-why can't everything be the same ? I'm still the same-- I don't appreciate-- I don't appreciate that, dad. You shouldn't say things like that to me. Hey. What's going on ? What ? Oh ! Did you talk to him ? Yeah. And ? He said he never wants to see me again. Oh, my god, Joe. I'm so sorry. He can't mean that. I don't know why I let you talk me into this ! It's just gonna take him some time, that's all. Like you're the expert on relationships ? I'm just trying to be a friend, Joe. You wanted to be more than friends, Polly. Remember ? Wanted to satisfy your curiosity ? Oh, is that what you think ? I think you're still interested. Maybe you can change me. Joe, I would not change a thing about you. Okay ? How about I leave like the rest of them, Polly ? You'd like that, wouldn't you ? Wait a minute. No ! God ! You know what ? No ! You don't get to do that ! God, I'm so sick of everybody leaving me ! I do not deserve this ! It's not fair ! I'm sorry. It's just that my father... Has this effect on me ! I start to sound like him. Give me a hug. Table 16. What about that guy ? No, too old. What about 22 ? Ugh. Lousy tip. Too cheap. Maybe it's me. Do you think it's me ? Do I bring out the worst in people ? You want my opinion ? Shut up ! Thank you. I'm just kidding, Manny. Love you, honey. Don't ever change. She's just not interested. It's personal. I tried, I tried. What am I gonna do ? You can't pull the deal. What are you talking about ? I got a contract right here. Contingent ? Contingent on what ? You're telling me without Stacy we're not on the air ? I just want you kids to know you did a hell of a job out there. I've seen all the hard work, and I'm really proud of all of you. But this is the last stop. Our sponsors are pulling out... 'Cause we're losing our TV coverage. That's it. It's all over. All this for nothing. I can't believe-- there's got to be more to it. It's a long story, but I want you to have the jerseys. You've earned them. And who knows ? Maybe we'll do something else down the road. I don't know. Thanks, anyway. Listen, come back tonight. We'll all have dinner and drinks. Thanks, Jake. Johnny, go press the button for me, would you, honey ? Thank you, sweetheart. Get set for the Bronx, raven. They're all over. - Stacy ! - Stacy ? Daniel. Wow. Even when I look at you today... I still see a 17-year-old ingenue. You're still so beautiful. Thanks. You're welcome. Why are you here ? I just want to talk. I want to listen. I'm a good listener now. Okay. What do you want to talk about ? I don't know. How about if we, uh, talk in the car ? Yeah, okay. Smile. - Stacy, did I hurt you in some way ? - No. Don't you think I deserved better than divorce papers being served to me... While you were on another continent ? Having to hire a private detective to find you ? I'm sorry. Daniel, you gave me everything that you wanted to give me... But you wouldn't give me the one thing that I wanted. - And what was that ? - My own life. Do you have any idea what this does to me ? To hear you say these things ? Stacy, I know you better than you know yourself. And you don't know what you want. And you liked everything we had. You had no life before you met me. None... Before you met me. I guess this is something... You had to do to prove something to yourself. Well, fine. Okay. Your point has been made. Let's go home. Aren't you forgetting about something ? We have a family now. It's time we get on with our lives. What are you talking about ? We don't have a family. "We don't have a family" ? I've seen him with my own eyes, and I can't believe you haven't told me about him. Saw who ? Him. This is not what you think. He's a kid I baby-sit. That's good. I'm serious ! He lives in my building. What have you done ? What have I done ? What have you done ? You were ten weeks pregnant when you left me. Daniel, I never had our baby. I heard the heartbeat ! I had a miscarriage ! Then why didn't you tell me ? Because I thought-- you thought what ? I was afraid what you might do. You wanted this baby so much and-- Stacy-- I was scared ! I think we should go now. Oh, my god ! Oh, my god ! No ! The last time you saw him, where was he ? You missed the turnoff. Yep. Where we goin' ? What's your hurry ? You in a hurry ? No, but, you know-- it's just, you know, Johnny's mother must be worried sick. Do you think maybe we should call her ? Do whatever you want. Okay. I got a computer printout, and that let me know who he was. I got a tracer-- - Hello ? - Becky. I'm so glad I caught you. - Stacy, are you all right ? - We've got Johnny. He's just fine. - Who's "we" ? - So, uh... Don't you worry, okay ? - Is Daniel with you ? - Uh-huh. Yep, that's right. Okay, don't hang up. Leave the line open. Okay. Okay, Which way are you heading ? Becky, you have a great time up in Malibu, okay ? I love it up there. You know, just up past Geoffrey's. It's-- hello ? - Everything all right ? - Uh-huh ! Yep, just fine. Johnny's mother, she has a very deep voice. That's it. Geoffrey's, Malibu. - You never wanted me to be happy, did you ? - Oh, Daniel. You've always thought of yourself. Shut up ! Oh, Dan-- Let me finish just for once ! It's okay, baby. You killed our baby. Breathe. It's all right. I know. Let it out. The last cell he was on was 54-a western. That's where the signal cut off. So that means that they've got to be somewhere in this area. Every paycheck went up your nose. Half the time you were shooting it in your arm ! This is all your fault. All of it ! This-- this is all I ever wanted. Don't go ! Come here ! Don't leave me ! Don't leave me ! Shh. Shh. Oh, Johnny ! Oh, baby ! Oh, Johnny ! Thank you so much. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Everybody loves you. Thank you. I'm really sorry about all this. If you'll still have me, I'd love nothing better than to be on that beach in that game. - It only takes one phone call. - I can't hide anymore. Welcome back. Thanks. You're just so handsome, Johnny, aren't you ? Hey, Jimmy, don't you think this is a little overdone ? - How you gonna fill this up ? - You wanted big, I got you big. I got the tent here, I got the grandstand. - I even got you good weather. - It's a beautiful day here in Southern California. We're here to cover a challenge volleyball match for charity... Between Jake mondello's restaurant and the south beach all-stars. Thank you. How do I look ? Let's go, guys ! Now entering the stadium-- let's have a big hand for the south beach all-stars !
