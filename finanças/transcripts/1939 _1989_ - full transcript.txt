You get punished for messing with it. -It's bad luck. -It's not bad luck. It will net us enough feed for two or three more cows. Citizens. The calamity, which we until the very last were hoping the world would be spared, has occurred. A new great war has begun. We have to accept this dreadful fact, and it does little good to try to express the sorrow and dread we now feel at the thought of the agony and despair this might bring for an already savaged and tortured humanity. As things stand now... What did I tell you? Huh? If you think Hitler invaded Poland because we were digging in the bog, you're even more superstitious than I thought. ...increased defense readiness means that tens of thousands of men for some time will have to leave their daily chores and families, and put on uniforms in service of their country. It's an obligation that each and everyone must take on, given our solemn assurance... You'll have to try to manage on your own now. We'll walk you to your train car to make sure you get on. Go on. Go home. We especially pray for those who are now afflicted by the scourge of war. Spare them and us. On this sacred Christmas Day morning, we pray for all the fathers, husbands, brothers and sons who cannot be with us today, but have been called upon to protect our country's borders from the terrible war raging in the world. -Gunnar, are you coming, or what? -Where are you going? Gunnar? What are you up to? What are those cans? No. What do you think the communists will do when the Russians are at the border? They'll shoot their officers and say "welcome." -Do I get the cans filled this weekend? -Yeah, yeah. Communists need to be kept on a short leash. I'm not sure the Russians will be the first ones to come knocking. We don't have anything to fear from the Germans. Misses Gustavsson, what a pleasure. Hello. -Is there any mail today? -No. I gather you're expecting a letter from your father. He won't have much time for that while in the field. -No. -Annika! There's a dance tonight. -Do you dance, Miss? -What? I thought I'd take the chance to shake a leg. Oh. It's not declarations of sympathy Finland is pleading for. Finland doesn't just need food, clothes, medical care and help for refugees. What Finland is pleading for is people. Men, soldiers and weapons. A dozen of our fighter planes would save many Finnish children from hours of terror in the winter cold. What do you think, Gunnar? How about you and I head to Finland and shoot Russians? -Stop it. -But it's not enough. Finland has long stood alone against red menace from the east. -When does the dance start? -Will the Russians stop at Torne River? Who thinks the barbarians will start preaching the gospel of peace there? Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! -Leave the room! -Bravo! - Let go of me! Let me go! Dammit, let go! Let go! We must assist Finland! Finland's cause is ours! There was so much sawdust in the bread that you had to use your wood coupon. That was rationing during the Great War. -What are you doing? -I want rigid legs, like Gunnar. -Annmari, that's nothing to joke about. -It's okay. There was this old man at the neighboring farm. His legs were so rigid you could use him as a wheelbarrow. -Stop it. -"Stop it. Stop it." -What's up with you? -I'm worried. -About what? -The farm and Olof. We'll do what they did in the old days, hitch the women to the plow. You can laugh, Gunnar. You're young and healthy and can chase dames. You won't be doing much dancing, of course, but don't be sad about that. It'll save you time and keep you out of the war. That war will soon be over. Annika. Annika! Left, left. Left, right, left, right. Germany has initiated military operations against Norway and Denmark. Radio Oslo announced this morning that German troops landed in Norwegian ports at 3 a.m. this morning. The US Minister in Oslo, Mrs. Harriman, sent a telegram during the night, stating that the Norwegian Foreign Minister notified her that Norwegians opened fire on four German warships heading up the Oslofjord, and that Norway is at war with Germany. There have not yet been any official announcements from Copenhagen. Annmari! Annmari, come here. Annmari! Annmari, go inside. -Hello, ma'am. Is your husband at home? -No, he's not at home. I wonder if you have a barn or something similar which we can borrow temporarily to billet our soldiers? -Temporarily? -Yes, at best we'll leave in a few weeks. And at worst, you might not need your barn anymore. You can borrow that house. It's empty. Thank you. Eliasson, take four men into that house and make sure there's a telephone there. Enoksson, take 14 men and set up the tents down there. -Good morning, ladies. -Good morning. Nice weather you have out here in the sticks. -Take the mail. - What did he say? -I don't know. Stockholmers always have to act like they're superior. Why can't Dad be here instead of in Lapland? You'd think so, but they must know what they're doing. Line up! Get dressed! Line up in one minute! Enoksson, get the telephone! -What's going on? -It's the war, you know. -What's going on? -Is it Germans? No, Norwegians. Fucking pigs! They took our guns! Fucking pigs! The big shots in Stockholm must be crapping their pants when they use our boys to disarm the Norwegians just to please that Hitler. It really pisses me off. Our Swedish lion is like a tiny hedgehog. I thought the Germans were coming. When the Germans come, they'll come with airplanes and tanks. Annika. Annika! -What? -Wake up. Can I offer you a smoke? I'll be damned. That's mighty nice of you. Thank you. Let's see if we can get you a light as well. There you go. Aunt Elin from Stockholm is here now! Hi. You've gotten big. Hi. Hi. No one can convince me that Russians are a peace-loving people. Just look what they've done in Finland. I still think it's bad that you at SJ would stoop so low as to enable German trains to pass through Sweden and catch the Norwegians from behind. It's a betrayal. You're not at home now. Hans, should we get going? Harald is waiting. Yeah, sure. - Thank you for the food. -Aren't you going dancing, Gunnar? -Me? No. Just look at Hitler. He's rampaging through Europe like a maniac and no one can offer any resistance. The only Swedes trying to warn people about that madman are the socialists, but they get censored, persecuted, imprisoned. You sure talk a lot. And you know a lot. It's important to take a stand. You have to take a stand. Sometimes, I'm just dying to get away from here. That would be a shame. If you were to die. Why not come to Stockholm? I promise I'll take care of you. It would never work. -Do you think the border is dangerous? -No. -It will be exciting. -Here's Harald. How can he ride around on that? Where does he get gasoline? I don't know. Hi. -Is that it? -Yes. Maybe you thought you'd get to see Hitler himself. -Come on, let's go dancing. -Yes. Do you know the new swing dance? I've read about it in the newspaper. Lie down, dammit. Oh my god, we have to get away from here. No! -Shit! -No! Annika! -What are you doing at the border?! -We got lost. -Hi. -Hi. -A letter from Dad. -Oh, thanks. What does he write? Well... that he's fine. What else? Nothing special. He misses home. What I'm writing is just between you and me. I don't want you talking to the children about it. One night, we were ordered to board a ferry. It was meant for 50 people, but we were 99 soldiers who went on board. When we were halfway across the lake, water flowed in over the bow. Those standing up front pulled back. I managed to get into one of the boats that were sent out. It instantly became overcrowded. I had to prevent others from getting on board, or we all would have died. There are lots of gulls over there. What are they doing there? Why are there so many gulls? The soldiers dump garbage and leftover food there. Three cooked meals a day, and they dump half of it for the gulls. It's a damn outrage. People are starving in these parts, and they behave like that. God dammit, I say. Come on, Gunnar. Let's go. You're off to run about, of course. Have you ever seen the ocean? -No. Have you? -Yeah. Once in Gothenburg. I went there to sign onto a ship, remember? I was too young. Maybe after the war. I'd also like to get away. -To Stockholm, maybe. -Stockholm? No, the ocean. I want to head out and see the world. -Take me with you. -Not on your life. -Thank you for the coffee. -Thank you. Give it to Annika. -I'll see you tomorrow, right? -Yes. What... Olof! Are you home so soon? Who were those characters? Who were they? -What's all this? -You know. I've written you. -Get them out of here! -Calm down. Get them out! Without the canteen, we wouldn't have managed all this time. I want them out! If you calm down, I'll get rid of them. I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave. Thank you. Bye. -Hi. -Hi. -Where's Dad? -Out hunting. He didn't even bring any shells. I like it better when he's screaming and angry. -Did you get anything? -No, nothing out there. The soldiers have scared them off. What is that?! Olof! Grab the wire! -Don't let go, Olof! -Dammit! -Dad! -Don't let go! Hold on! -Don't let go! -Help out! Pull! -What is it? -A barrage balloon from England. Hold on! Don't let go! -We have to anchor it somewhere. -Devilish monster. Harald! Such lovely fabric. Help me! Isn't this a beautiful color? Huh? It will be our fanciest dresses ever. Look at this fabric! O blessed morn To tidings long by prophets borne Hast thou fulfillment given Hey, Annika! Annika! Hey! What are you doing out in this weather? Get on. -Where are we going? -I know a place. We have to find shelter. It won't go any further. Come here. Help out. You're a real black marketeer. Nah. But I'm looking to expand over time. Are you going to have a whole pig farm out here in the woods? Who gave you that idea? The grocer, of course. It's crazy. Does he keep a pig as well? Pigs. He works on a completely different scale. But like I said, I'll expand over time. But who do you sell to? The grocer. And you get money. -I get coffee and sugar... -Cheese, cocoa and gasoline. And lots of other stuff which you sell for a pretty penny. -Do you want anything? -No. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. I haven't told anyone. But... I may need help sometime. Come here. Come here. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Care to dance? -No, I don't feel like dancing. -Of course we should dance. Come on. -No, I don't want to. Sure you do. We're looking for Harald. You don't know any place where Harald hangs out? -Some place where he might hide. -No. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Was it your pig? -I don't have any pigs. No? But maybe you know where your associate is? He's suspected of more serious things than black market pigs. The night before last, there was a break-in at a military storage site. Let's go. Harald! Harald. Be quiet now. Real fucking quiet. If you stay quiet, nothing will happen to you. Who are you and what the hell are you doing here? -I know Harald. -Are you his sweetheart? -No, I came to warn him. -Of what? The police are coming. They could be here any second. For real? Dammit! -Where the hell have you been? -What are you doing here? We have to leave quickly. The police are coming. -Did you tell them I was here, Annika? -No, but the grocer did. We have to get to the border. - Run home, don't talk to anyone. She's coming with us. I don't trust anyone. I don't want her involved. Let's go. Take it easy, dammit! -Bye. -Good luck. I'm crossing the border as well. See you. -How could you do something so stupid? -I haven't done anything. You've been out running about. -Where have you been? -Out walking. You've been out and about with Harald, causing mischief at night. -Stealing from people. -I haven't stolen anything. Stealing from decent people who barely have enough food to eat. And from the soldiers. How the hell could you do something so stupid?! I haven't done anything. I have no idea what Harald did. I was at home that night. But you've been out causing mischief on other nights? Olof, stop arguing. -The police said he's not a suspect. -I don't care what the police say. I'm worried about what people around here will think. It doesn't matter what people around here will think. He's been cleared. How would that look? My son locked up in prison for theft? -Turn off that damned radio! -If you'll leave the boy alone! If he says he didn't steal, then he didn't steal. That's all there is to it. It would be just as well if he went to prison. Then we'd have one less mouth to feed this winter. I'm going away. Yes, I'm going away, to Stockholm. It's a damn German train! This pisses me off. Schweinhunden! Idioten! Schwein! Damn Nazis! Three destroyers blown up in Horsfjärden! Three men dead! Three destroyers blown up in Horsfjärden! Three men dead! Three destroyers blown up in Horsfjärden! Three men dead! Hi, Annika! I'm sorry I'm late, but they wouldn't let me leave work. I really tried to be here on time. I'm sorry, Annika. -I want to go home. -Are you going home? -But you just got here. -Everything's ruined. All the food I brought is gone. What a disaster. The main thing is that you're here, right? Mm! Amazing apples. Come on, I'll show you the city. Come on, Mom is waiting at home. The train to Gothenburg, by way of Hallsberg, will leave from track 3 at 5 p.m. See how beautiful it is? No, no! No, it's nothing. That's the signal line, but we have to switch trams here anyway. -Hi. -Hello. What can you do in the evenings? There's a lot to do. Go to the movies or go out dancing. Annika, Ella wrote that she would be sending some goodies from the countryside. Oh, I forgot to tell you. We pestered the luggage desk, but the package had gotten lost. It had been stolen. I can't imagine that anyone at Rickard's company would steal. What kind of nonsense is that? I'll talk to Rickard when he comes home. Yeah, I thought it was strange. At SJ of all places. -Hello. -Hello. Sleep tight. -You're dangerous! -No. -Is this where you work? -There. -See you tonight. -Yeah. Bye. PASTRY SHOP -Are you also applying for the job? -Yes, but they're not open yet. There must be an employee entrance. Come on. Here it is. Come on. -Hi, Berit. -Hi, Anna. -You're late today. -Yes, I overslept. Right as I was leaving, the landlady came to tell me the rent is going up because of increased fuel costs. Fuel costs. I've forgotten what hot water is. Alright, girls. The boss said we're looking for a blonde girl this time. Those of you with dark hair don't have to waste time waiting around. Is it so the hairs can't be seen in the buttercream? Or is it because you only want Aryans serving your buns? You don't want to look for work here. -Do you have a cigarette? -No, I don't smoke. That's great. I really shouldn't, either. I can't afford it. What's your name? -Annika. -Berit. -I need to keep looking for work. -There's no point. Try early tomorrow. Then I'll just walk around. I can't come home this early. -I don't my aunt and uncle to think-- -That you've been walking the streets. -Bye. -Bye. And don't do anything foolish! -Oh, you're here. -I've been out looking for work. There are lots of job openings here. Hi. What were you arguing about? SJ. His stupid company. They refuse to distribute socialist newspapers. -What does that have to do with you? -I distribute them around the country. Not just me, of course. There are many of us. We have to smuggle them on the trains. Isn't that dangerous? Someone has to make sure people read something other than Nazi newspapers. Annika, most people in this country live like there's no Hitler and no war. Yeah. -Did you find a job? -No. -I'll try again tomorrow. -I'm sure you'll find one. Number 16! Annika! There's an empty chair here! Come on! Number 17! -Hi, hi. Sit down. -Hi. -What's your number? -52. Mine's 18. Chair number 18. The same as Albert Engström. -He died last year, so it's vacant now. -Oh. The author. "Kolingen." -Number 18. -That's me! Yuck. Hello. Berit Karlsson. Nah. I understand why no one wants to hire us. I talk too much, and you look so shy and scared that no one dares hire you. But I know a place where they need people. I've worked there before, but I didn't much like it. -Here it is. -Berit, I can't. Come here. I'll fix you up. -I can't wait tables. -You applied for a job at the pastry shop. I've just helped serve buns and coffee for the soldiers back home. Buns for grunts or sole for directors - it's all the same. Dammit, Berit! You know damn well you can't come this way. So, what do you think of your new workplace? -No way. -Hi, Berit. Hi there. -Five fillet of veal, two sizzlers. -Four hash ready! -Two herring ready! -Three patents and two painters. Where's the main course for table 6? Are you daydreaming? We have 40 guests out there! Axelsson, help Olin with the potatoes. And why have you stopped? Get back to work. Dirty Jew, I'll make sure you don't last long here. Are you ever going to finish that extra smorgasbord?! -Ho-ho! Sorry. -No, not you, too. Look on the bright side. Once you're done with this, in an hour or so, you'll have an entire day off and a week's pay to spend. -Arbeit macht frei! -Get lost! Here you go. I'm in a hurry. Tell the chef I'll be back next week. Hey there! -Where the hell are the feet? -Feet? The paws, then. Rabbit should be delivered with paws and heads. This could be anything. -You can tell it's rabbit. -How would I know? -It could be cat or rat. -Cat?! Yes, cat! I know which rules I have to follow! Do you think I'll violate ordinances for your sake, you bum?! Take the box back! And never come here again! Don't let that salesman in here again! Why are you standing around? Get back to work. If you've come here to stare, you'll have to pay admission! Damn morons in this place. Wrong side! We could use some German discipline in this kitchen to get things done. -Shut up that nasty man. -Where the hell is the snaps? Have you locked the liquor box? Nonsense! -What did you do last weekend? -I went out biking. -Biking? -Yes, with Hans. -God, how boring. -Two herring ready. At least you're saving up money for Christmas shopping. No, I bought new shoes. 19 kronor. Cheap, huh? Annika, table 6 is waiting. -Looky here, guys! -Hi, cutie pie! Is it mine? What did you get? -Huh? -Annika! -Is it really mine? -Yes. But you have to let the others use it, if they want to. Is it a camera? Is it a camera? I'll be damned. She's earning the big bucks. -No, don't take a picture of me. -Do you press here? Where does she get the money? Maybe she's an embezzler. -Grandpa... -We'll take one next Christmas. -Take a picture of Grandpa. -Annika. Your dad and I were thinking... It was actually your dad who thought of it. We really want to... We were thinking... -You don't have any furniture. -No. We want you to... take this with you to Stockholm. I can't take that. Go ahead and take it. I've looked in that. It wasn't always much fun, but it at least gave you an idea about the state of things. Thank you. Bravo! -Which one do you pick? -Do I have to pick one? Why not several? You can have as many as you want. It's the only thing that's not rationed. I think I'll have the one with the flag. No, that dark, handsome one at the back. The dark one? I was going to have him. He won't be easy to bag. That's Bengt Hall, a successful and famous runner. Oh my. If he came running after me, he wouldn't have to run for very long. Let's thank the handsome representatives from all the athletic associations in and around Stockholm, who through their combined efforts have taken part in this dazzling gymnastics performance! "Combined efforts." Several workers' associations weren't even invited. And now we'll start the dance. I'm borrowing your cousin for a while, until the real guys show up. Thanks a lot. -Care to dance? -No, thank you. Oh, come here! - Sorry! -There you are. I've been looking for you. -I thought you were busy. -Have you seen the guy with the flag? -No. Me, neither. Why aren't you dancing? -I don't know these dances. -It's easy, watch. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And turn around and do like this. You'll learn quickly. No problem. There he is! Hang on. -I'm sorry, it was an accident. -It's okay, I rather enjoyed it. -Thank you. -I think we've got everything. -Thank you. -Care to dance? What? Shall we dance? Yes, thank you. Help yourself. I was just thinking... -I don't know your name. -Annika. Bengt. I noticed you the second I walked in. -Are you cold? -No. Do you want to borrow my gloves? To help warm you up. Oh, excuse us. We wanted to watch the fireworks. Jonne, there are no fireworks. There's a blackout after midnight. Come on. Dammit! I have to be back before midnight. I have to run. I'm sorry. Bye. Happy New Year, everybody! I'm going crazy! That's my second runner this month. You know the deal. Skipped bills get docked from your pay. Yeah, yeah. If they don't have money, they shouldn't eat out. -And I get stuck with the bill. -Keep a closer eye on your guests. Four game croquettes ready. What are you up to? Breaking china? Why do I have to wash dishes whenever someone's out sick? I'm a waitress. -You're the most recent hire. -Fresh meat in the kitchen. -We were hired at the same time. -No, I was hired two minutes earlier. -Get lost! -I don't need you. There are more dames here than crabs on a bum's pecker. -Creep! -He's like that with everyone. -That's no excuse. -Are you here to work or to smoke? Arbeit macht frei, as the Germans say. I'm just getting a clean ashtray. Right, Franz? Man muss arbeiten! Have you heard from Cinderella boy? What Cinderella boy? The guy who ran off without his gloves. You know very well that I haven't. I think you should forget about him. It's been several weeks. He's forgotten. Pardon me, I was just trying to be friendly. Dammit! -Take her first. -She's dead, let's take this one. Broken leg, lacerations, burns. -Which leg? -It doesn't say. Take it easy! One, two... Ready? One, two, three! -Take it easy! -What are you doing? -What are you up to? -Be quiet, you're unconscious. -No! -Go left. I'm getting stuck here. -Can't you get off and walk? -My leg is broken. -We're collecting casualties here. -We'll tip you over. You're out of your minds! This is war! Take it easy. Careful around the bend. -Here we are. -Take it easy. I'm falling off! Take it easy! No, stop it! Get off, or we'll tip you over. Here's one with face lacerations, broken leg and... -And quite a mouth on her. -Idiot! Be quiet, this is war. "Severe burns." Too bad, she's a pretty girl. Maybe we should give her mouth-to-mouth. I think she needs it. This is not a joke! Thanks to its policy of neutrality, Sweden has managed to stay out of the war, but the defense commitment and readiness you have demonstrated during today's drill makes me wonder if we wouldn't suffer fewer casualties by getting involved in the war than by drilling for it. Try to take this seriously! -I fell asleep up there, and dreamt. -She's right. -Who? -The drill instructor. We go about our own business every day, like there's no war. It's like we try to hide from all things evil. I don't think it's possible in the long run. To hide. Hans talks like that as well. What does he think one should do? Take a stand and all that. Do you know what I dreamt? That it was summer and sunny, the birds were chirping and you were a bride. No, I dreamt that Dad and I were walking in the woods. Then I woke up and didn't know where I was. -I thought the war was raging at first. -The war is raging, Annika. Bye! -Is your name Hans Zetterberg? -Yes, why do you ask? -Please come with us. -What is it? What have I done? -We want to talk to you. Get in! -Take it easy! My aunt and uncle don't seem to know where he is, either. Surely they would know if he'd been drafted? -It's weird. -Here it is. Time to look at the apartment. Better watch our step in there. -Hello, hello. -Welcome. Here's the kitchen. It's so small. Back home, the kitchen is the largest room. Why do I even need a kitchen? We eat at work. I think it looks nice. Look at this. It could use some cleaning. Large cupboards. A water closet inside the apartment. Not bad. And it works as well. You don't have that in Värmland. It's so big! Living room. We'll have a couch here, so we can throw parties. If I shared the apartment with my best friend, of course. -I don't know if I can, Berit. -Sure you can. Nice view. And the bedroom. One bed there and one bed there. I think it's amazing. Look! -Well, what do you think, ladies? -I don't know, it doesn't face south. And the kitchen is very small. We've been looking at other apartments as well. I have another empty apartment, but that one faces the courtyard. You'll at least get some sun in here. There's a bathroom in the basement and the rental conditions are very favorable. -First month rent free. -First quarter, then we'll take it. You just can't get proper fabric these days. Look. I can't do anything more with this collar. You can only turn it over so many times. How are they doing back home? I got a letter from Mom last week. Apparently Dad isn't feeling well. Good evening. I'm Chief Inspector Virén. I'd like to speak with Annika Gustavsson. Well, then. Where's this? Dalarna, right? No, Värmland. Close to the border. I see. "Nice to hear that you're doing well, despite times being hard." I thought you had it good in the countryside. Black market pigs and... "I'm doing fine. My co-workers are kind and decent, even if they can be--" Can you really do that? Read letters like that? Either I read it now while you watch, or it's read by mail censors without you knowing anything about it, so... Who is this Berit? Berit Karlsson. We're co-workers. -Do we have anything on her? -No. Well, here you go. Well... This guy Hans, where is he? I've told you I don't know where he is. He's doing his military service somewhere, but I guess you're not supposed to know where. Do you mean you don't know where he is? Or do you mean that you're not supposed to know? Or do you mean that you actually know? I've told you I don't know. I've asked his parents, but they say they don't know, either. So you've tried to find out where he is, despite the fact, as you say, that you're not supposed to know? Yes. Or no. I've tried to find out... how I could write him. Surely that's not forbidden? Why is it so important, as you write in your letter, to get in touch with him? I didn't write that. I wrote that I would like to see him. Why? I don't know. Because he's my cousin. We've known each other since we were young. We played together during summers. We usually write each other and say how we... Has something happened to him? Where is he? He's at Storsien. You know what Storsien is, right? Is that where he is? Do you know he's there? So why are you asking me? We're not asking because we want to know where he is. We're asking because we want to know if you know where he is. -Why would I...? -Storsien is a labor camp. We have a labor camp at Storsien, where we intern people with political views that are dangerous to this country. -Communists, anarchists. -What about Nazis? No, they haven't said anything about them. Probably because they're harmless. What do I know? -So what happens now? -Nothing. We just wanted to talk. We just want you to know that we're around. It's an amazing apartment, Annika. You can't miss out on the chance to live with me. I've already decided that I'm moving in. Time for the surprise. You won't believe your eyes when you see it. Hi. I'm picking up a package from Herrljunga. It probably arrived yesterday, but I didn't have time to come here. Guys, Herrljunga is here! Get it as quick as you can. I was supposed to get the package at Christmas, but my family is a bit slow. -I thought they would be dead. -Here you go. -Good luck. -How do we get them home? Good luck, ladies. -Do you know how to kill them? -Yes, do you have an axe at home? An axe? No. -Annika? -Harald! What are you doing here? Can't someone help me here? There, there. Annika, do you know of any available apartments? My friend Bjarne just got here from Norway. He needs a place to hide for a few days. He's taking a courier flight to England and doesn't want to end up in a Swedish internment camp. Yes, maybe we can arrange something. There should be a ban on live animals in taxis. You got paid double. How much money do you want? -I want triple fare. -That's extortion! Stop the car! Stop! -I want my money back. -Get out! Will I get my money back?! Will I get my money back?! You're supposed to do your job! -Do you want them? -Sure. -Here, they're yours. -Thanks. -Come on, Annika. -I'll be in touch. Yeah, see you around. Halt! Stop! Stop! Oh my! What's in the suitcase? -Did you get Harald's key? -Yeah, yeah. And the next one. Come on! Drive! Bye-bye! -Where did you get all the furniture? -An ex-boyfriend. He got a barn full of furniture after clearing out attics. -He was actually pretty nice. -Someone you...? No way, he's too stupid. Hey, what do you think about this? I bought it yesterday. I got it cheap because of the hole. It made me think of Värmland. In case you get homesick. We can hang it over the couch. Damn Hitler for all these blackouts. Look! There's one of Harald's wards. -Yes, but you never see Harald around. -I wonder how the turkeys tasted. It's not working. We need a proper hammer. I give up. I give up, too. -So where do we hang Värmland? -Over the couch, you said. Oh right. I wonder how they're doing at home. -Don't you ever miss your mother? -Nah. I was young when she took off. Aren't you curious? -I actually found out where she lives. -Really? I thought I'd go there, but I don't know. Do it. It should be exciting. I've thought a lot about her. And I've been angry. If I see her, she may turn out to be really nice, and I couldn't handle that. Or maybe she's as dumb and selfish as she seems, and I couldn't handle that, either. That would make me really sad. Oh well. Drop the gloves, Annika, and dance with me. -I'm all sweaty. -I bought drinks. Want me to pour? Yes. I hope you're not bored, Stig? No, no, I'm eating here. Want a light? Sure, thanks. What? I don't understand. My name is Annika. I'm from Värmland. Värmland. He's really small. I thought all negroes were big. -Ask where they're from, Stig. -No. Go on, ask. -What did they say? -They don't answer questions. Maybe they're on a secret mission. How exciting! They're just ordinary grunts. Small-timers. I wish the war never ends. All the handsome foreigners would go away. -Hi. Are you Annika? -Yes. This is for Harald. He'll pick it up later. -Do you know where he is? -No, no one ever knows where he is. -Thank you. -Bye. What a throw! Did you see that? I think it equaled the record. -Did you see that, Annika? -Isn't this exciting, Annika? A lunatic in ugly shorts throwing a stick as far as possible. It's funny. -Really funny getting a sore bottom. -Why so surly? I'm not surly. I'm tired. Someone made a lot of noise in my bedroom last night. Time for the 100-meter dash, girls. Well, I'll be damned. Do you see who it is? Cinderella boy. -Bengt. -Do you know Bengt Hall? He's a famous runner. He could win, but there are a few other contenders. On your marks. Get set. Go, Bengt! Faster! Yes! Great, Bengt! I can't just walk in. What do I say? "Hi, remember me?" Use your imagination. Come up with an excuse. -No, I can't. -Here he is. Please, can we just go? -Hi, Annika. -Hi. -You're a really good runner. -Thanks. It got a bit sudden last time. -These are my friends. Berit and Stig. -Hi, Bengt. -Strong performance. -Thanks. Bengt, hurry up! What happened last time? -On New Year's Eve, with your leave. -Oh, right. -I got confined to barracks for two weeks. -How dull. -Come on, Bengt! -I have to go. It was nice to see you. You, too. -Bye. -Bye. Bye, Bengt. Hurry up. Hurry! Annika? -Could I see you sometime? -Yes. I work at Gillet. Then I'll be in touch. -Bye. -Bye. Who was that? Aren't you going to introduce me? It has to work! Suck in your stomach. Are you really wearing this? You'll choke. Of course I have to wear a corset. They get turned on by having to fight, but this isn't clothes, it's a fortress. There are more modern forms of birth control. I barely know him. I'd better come equipped. He's a soldier, or he used to be. -Oh no, the air raid siren! -When are you supposed to meet him? -Half an hour from now. -It's probably just a drill. -You think so? -Yes, hurry along. It could be for real. Let's go downstairs. Take it easy! This is just a drill, but it will probably take an hour. No! What did I tell you? You'll be stuck with me in a root cellar instead of meeting a handsome guy. Bengt! -Hi. I'm sorry I'm so late. -That's okay. The air raid siren went off. We had to go down to the shelter. I know. I saw them fly past. A police officer came by and tried to force me into the nearest shelter. -I told him I was waiting for a lady. -You're crazy. What if it had been real? Then I would have stood here and watched Stockholm go up in flames. I'm just kidding. I knew that it was a drill. -You're all wet. -We agreed to meet at the Tornberg Clock. Seriously, Annika, I couldn't risk leaving in case you would show up. If I hadn't been here, I would never forgive myself. I brought your gloves. I had to wash them, so they may have shrunk a bit. Yeah, or I've gotten too big. Here's the tram. -I've reserved a table at Operakällaren. -We can't show there like this. Why not? Your dress is lovely and I'm wearing my best suit. Let's go. For real? We finally got to Operakällaren, though your stubborn friend wanted to come here. The head waiter said: "Where are you going?" "To the dining room." "You can't come in here." "But we have a table reservation. Director Hall." The iron! Isn't she lovely? Do you want to see some more pictures? Yeah, sure. -Who's that? -My sister Annmari. She's really pretty. She's the most precious thing I have. This is my grandpa Isak. He's out of his mind, but really funny. -Should I put on some music? -Sure. -What do you want to listen to? -Anything. We only have three records. So, you're a director? Yes, almost. My dad is. You're the first almost-director I've met. Of what? Veneer. We purchase veneer from abroad and sell it in Sweden. We've done pretty well these last few years. During the war? I guess we bet on the right horse. So how did it go? -The head waiter, Operakällaren. -Oh right. -You said "Director Hall." -Right. "I don't care who you are. This is a dining establishment, not a bathhouse." "Try Sturebadet," he said. I almost died of embarrassment. -Are my clothes dry yet? -Yes, they're on the ironing board. I think I'll get dressed. -Then I have to leave, Annika. -So soon? Yes, I have a meeting tomorrow. I'll be right back. -What do you think? -And you call me easy. You barely know the guy and you've already got him undressed. Shame on you. -He's not really your type. -There's only one type. They can seem nice on the outside, but there's only one thing they're after. Annika, come here a second. Your hat! Bye. This is my place. It's a bit messy. I love you. -Can I really show up like this? -You look great. Come on. Are you sure? I think I look plain. No, you look great, and my parents are just ordinary people. Come on. There, almost time for food. But where is she? There. - Oh, good. Time to get down, and you'll also get food. There. And you as well. Oh, tasty stuff. And some for you. Really tasty. Oh yes, there you go. Here's some food for you. There. The dinner table isn't really a suitable place for dogs. -Alfred, the dogs are part of the family. -Yeah, yeah. If my mother had to choose between me and her dogs, she'd choose the dogs. Pour some water for our guest. And some water for the little darlings. Thank you. I'm sure Miss Gustavsson likes animals. Bengt told us that Miss Gustavsson's father owns a farm. Yes. -A country farm? -Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very interested in everything involving Bengt. He's the best thing we have. -Where is it? -In Värmland. Kristina, clear the table and serve coffee in the small parlor. This is Karlberg, the cadet ball. You're so handsome, Bengt. And that's Ambassador Carling's daughter. A charming girl. She has a bachelor's degree in Nordic languages. Bengt, maybe you should have continued your military career. You could have gotten a position at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have no use for military types or ambassadors at the company. And that reminds me, Bengt... I didn't see you at the office today. No, I was busy with other things. Oh. Excuse me. That my employees waste time is something I can understand. Given the kind of employees you have to accept these days. But I don't want you doing it as well. -Can we agree on that? -Yes. I'm sorry, Miss Gustavsson, for bringing this up like this, on this pleasant occasion. I care a lot about Bengt's future. It would be a shame if he were to waste it on distractions. I should get going now. I can't hold it any longer! Take this. -Why? -Stand guard. Annika. Things might be a bit primitive at home, but we do have toilets, Annika. Please don't think I'm silly. I don't think you're silly. I think you're great. Move your buttocks! We have a bunch of Christmas smorgasbords today. Who's that? Hanna. Annika, come on! Is she your daughter? -She's cute. -Annika, hurry! I'm coming! Franz! -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Director Hall has been here before, I see. That's right. Several times. What can I get you gentlemen? Maybe Miss can recommend something tasty? -I don't know... -Smorgasbords? I have to remind you that the Food Commission has limited the number of plates to six, due to rationing. -Maybe you could make an exception? -No, I'm afraid that's not possible. Save your charm, Lindberg. You're 30 years too old. Six... plates. We'll have that. We'll also want beer and snaps. If Miss will join us, it'll be five snaps. I'm afraid I can't. Perhaps Miss's fiancé would object. -Will that be all for now? -Thank you very much. Thank you. -What is it? What is it? -It's nothing. -What is it? -Nothing. -Wait! Annika! -It will never work! Have I done something? Ouch! Annika, what is it? -I can't be with you anymore. -Why not? I'm not good enough for you, not good enough for your family. -What makes you say that? -It's just a fact. -It's not true. -Yes, it is! -What are you talking about? -He was disgusting. -What? -He was disgusting! Who? Who?! Don't talk to me! Don't touch me! Annika. -I got here first! -Are you taking that side? Let's see if this works. No suds. They cheated me. Look. What? No. -With Bengt? -Yes. I really like him. It's not his parents I'm getting engaged to. Oh well. Congrats on your first engagement. And the last. You can congratulate me as well. For what? Look. Don't you think they've gotten bigger? Maybe a bit. I'm pregnant. No. -How? -What do you mean, "how"? -With whom? -I don't know. There are three possibilities, but it doesn't matter. I don't want any of them. But you must know who the father is? Are you going give up the child? Absolutely not! You're out of your mind. But what will you do? How will you manage? If Dad had still been alive, he would say: "Berit, you've managed fine without a mother. Your child will manage without a father as well." I guess I'll find a man eventually. Turn around. I'll lather your back. I'll miss you once you get married. I can't leave you now, not when you're pregnant. One badger, two crow, one rabbit. I don't know how they can eat that crap. There's something wrong with your digestion, Berit. It really shows. She's ingested something other than crow or rabbit. -Two ragout ordered. -It must have been something big. Given how fat she's gotten. Big or small, it's always sweet, like the girl said about the boy. Next stop Åmotfors. New passengers? We're almost there, only one station to go. It's so hot. We're in the middle of nowhere. Do people really live here? -I've lived here my entire life. -Damn. How did you cope? I'm sure it'll be fine. -You think so? -Yes. You'll really charm them. Annmari won't leave you alone for a second. -But Dad can be a bit dour. -I know, you've told me that. I don't like it. Having your family stare at me and decide if I'm good enough. I don't like it. He was a regular terror for the officers. Let's have a little... -A little... -Exactly. Yes? Just keep it there. There, thank you. -Olof... -It's okay. So what happened to Hovis? He can't have lasted long in the military. -No, he drowned. -Drowned? I don't know if you heard about the accident up in Norrland? The ferry that tipped over. A terrible disaster. -Let's work on our glasses. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Cheers. Really nice to have you here. I'll never forget Hovis. He really knew how to run his mouth. I bet he did. Tell us! In September of '39, when the war broke out, the regimental commander had all the men line up. He told the men: "Hitler marched into Poland at 0400 hours this morning." Then Hovis said: "Those are guys who know how to get up early in the morning." I'll just... -More herring, Bengt? -Yes, please. -It's really nice to have you here. -Yes, charming. And we really appreciate your help around the farm. -Oh, don't mention it. -I didn't think Stockholmers could work. I knew that it was a mistake to help out. I'll be stuck here now, like Jacob with Leah and Rachel. Those trees over there were planted by my great-grandfather. Isn't that amazing, Annika? Everything is strong, as long as it stays healthy. I fear what is happening now. This new time. Only the best is good enough. Apparently that goes for both animals and people. But I worry most about you and Annmari. You are so young and have to take part in building this new society which has gotten such a bad start. It's not fertile ground. Don't forget the old ways, Annika. It's so easy to lose your footing. And end up alone. Take it easy, I'm on my way now. Bye. -Where are you going? -The maternity ward. It's time. -What will you do there? -What do you mean? What will you do there? At the maternity ward? I can be there. The baby's father isn't around. -You can't do anything about that. -No, but-- She's placed herself in this situation with her lifestyle. It's not your fault. She's my best friend and I can be there to support her. And her lifestyle is no different from ours. How are you? -Was it difficult? -It was horrible. I just saw him. He's wonderful. Have you thought about what to call him? No. I guess I'll name him after his fathers. Lennart-Stig-Åke. We'll get through this. I'm so tired. -Did you find anything? -No. You got lucky, you bastard. Now! I'll get the sausage, and the bacon. Where is she? She's coming! -What's this? -Party time! -Why? -Bachelorette party! Just think, you're lying there underneath some guy. Then he jerks a little after a while, and it turns into something that amazing. Cheers to that. Cheers, little jerk. You probably enjoy the spasms just as much as the men. Dear Annika. It is with sorrow, sadness and dismay that we're forced to accept that you will now be leaving us, and instead tie the knot of matrimony. No! I'll just furnish the apartment, and then I'll be back. -That's what they all say. -Let's put on some music. And I also have to help Berit with Peter. Annika, shall we dance? Let's all drink to Annika having landed herself a man, whom we hope you'll enjoy thoroughly. And to being just as well off without one. Right, girls? It's wonderful. Really. Amazing fabric. You can't get that back home. No need, I can manage. It's okay. It'll just take a few seconds. Annika, you don't have to. Annika! Annika! -One more thing. -What's this? Did you make this yourself? Yes, but Gunnar made the frame, so it's from him as well. It's lovely. It should have been my wedding bouquet. -I love you. -I love you, too. Bye. You look great! -It broke. -No, no, it's no big deal. It's supposed to break. It's good if it does. You know, in the old days back home, it was said that a broken bridal crown meant good luck. Annika... Your mother and I, we... I just wanted to say that we... We care deeply about you. -Good luck. -Bye now. Get in. Bye! I'm superstitious. -We could have taken the elevator. -No, that wouldn't count. The groom is supposed to carry the bride over the threshold. We should have gotten married in the countryside, where it's at the door. What are we going to do in an empty apartment? You'll see. That's the surprise. Now. Ouch! Well? What do you think? -What's this? -It's ours. It's our home. That's the surprise. Annika. Here, I'll show you. Come here. Don't look. Dining room, kitchen. Annika, isn't it lovely? Did you see the kitchen? New table and new chairs. -It's furnished. -Yes. A wedding gift from my parents. I'll show you something. Come on. Look. Music. There. And the office. This is my office, Annika. I'll sit here and work. And my secretaries can sit here. -Your bag? -Yes, everything's set. 3rd August, 1943. Dear diary. Yesterday I was Miss Annika Gustavsson. Today I've woken up as Mrs. Annika Hall. Good morning, Mrs. Hall. Already awake? Are you leaving? Come here! No, I'm sorry, I have things to do. Look under the bed. -Look under the bed. -Look under the bed? Yes, don't argue with me. I'm your husband, so I'm in charge here. I'll be back soon. Under the bed. I smell rabbit. Is it the fur or Mrs. Hall? More like Mr. Hall. Annika, go home and shave. You've gotten all furry. You've moved up a notch, huh? Hi! -You look great! -Hi, Annika. -I missed you at the wedding. -Yeah, me too-- -Four game ragout. -I couldn't get a babysitter. -Who ordered four game ragout?! -I did! Take care of them! -How about a night out sometime? -Sure, that would be fun. Berit, god dammit! Get moving! It's just hard to get a babysitter. I have to serve these. -I'll call you! -Where are the onions? Hi, Franz. You've... quit? -Always? -No, just for a while. How's your daughter? Don't know. Is she still in Germany? Maybe. -In Germany-- -Franz! Franz! Where the hell is Franz?! Find him! Check outside! Franz! American, British and Canadian forces have landed on Sicily. It's the first step towards the liberation of the European continent. General Eisenhower, who today-- Aren't you going to get dressed? Has something happened? Well? No. No, it's just business. I thought I'd go to the store. Annika? How about we invite some friends over tonight? It doesn't have to be anything fancy. Annika? -What's that? -My diary. Do you keep a diary, Annika? I had no idea. Let me have a look. -Let me see. -No! -Yes. Does it say anything about me? -Yes, it's all about you. -Secrets? Let me see. -No, give it to me. -Let me look, Annika. -Stop it! You can't read it. I won't read it. I promise. -Who could that be? -I'll answer the door. -Hans! -Hi. Mom told me you live here now. -Have you just been released? -No, I've been out for a while. Come in. I'll get you coffee or something to eat. No, I thought we could go out instead. Who is it, Annika? Hans, my cousin. - Bengt, my husband. Oh. Hi, Hans. -You were interned at Storsien, right? -Yes, that's right. -So you're a communist? -Yes. We're going out for a while. We haven't seen each other in a long time. You must have a lot to talk about. -You're family, after all. -See you later. Here you go. - Here you go. What happened up there? What happened up there, Hans? We... built a road. We built a road out in the middle of nowhere. We tore up and built, tore up and built... Tore up and built... Tore up... There were rumors that they would bomb the camp with Swedish planes and then blame the Russians. What's the point of that? What's the point, Annika? I can't take it anymore, Annika. I can't take it. Is there anyone who can take it? -Now you'll see, guys. -5... -Not looking good. -The Viking blood won't be denied. -You're 58. -58? -57 point... -You're squeezing! 57.1. Hi, Annika! -Say hi to my wife. -Hi. She's been out with her cousin Hans. He's a communist. He was locked up at Storsien to stop him from selling out Sweden to the Russians. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It occurs in the best of families. Hi, Annika. Come sit down. Entertain my friends for a while. -I thought I'd go to bed. -No, sit down! Let's see if Bengt's new wife belongs to the Aryan race. What are you doing? -We'll measure your skull. -The moment of truth. Let's see if the noble lady belongs to the Aryan race, or maybe she's a quarter-Jew. -Stop it. -We're just joking around! What do you say, guys? Maybe I should get myself a little waitress. They seem perky and nice. And she smells good. Can you please tell your friend to let go of me? Don't be like that. Have a seat and let's get acquainted. We're keen to get to know the other part of humanity. So you don't like our company? What would you prefer?! Communists, kitchen rabble and busboys? Annika, are you angry? You'll have to forgive the guys. They can get a bit rowdy, but they don't mean any harm. We've been invited to a theater play at the German embassy, Annika. Lots of people. Maybe we can talk to the Minister about our supply problems. Of course we will. That's why we're here. The traffic is backed up. It's probably better if you walk the rest of the way. We're paying handsomely for a taxi and still have to walk half of the way. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention for a moment? Please be quiet. Ladies and gentlemen, I profoundly apologize for the embarrassing and unpleasant situation you've ended up in, and which we at the German embassy are in no way responsible for. This is an act of sabotage, ladies and gentlemen! It's meant to injure the cordial relationship between our countries. Treacherous and hostile groups have malevolently distributed forged tickets to this evening's gala performance. I have to inform you that the valid tickets have been printed on green invitation cards. What was meant to be a manifestation of the friendship between our countries... Lindberg! Where did you get those? Lindberg! ...and subversive elements of society. I once again would like to apologize and emphasize that the German embassy is in no way responsible for this provocation. I'll now ask you to let through those with genuine invitations... Harald! -Do you know that prick? -No, I must be mistaken. -I thought it was someone from back home. -Damn prick! I could have been mistaken, but it looked like Harald. They yelled about Jews sabotaging the performance, but they couldn't know. He's lovely. Aren't you and Bengt going to have children? Yes... I don't know. I have Peter. -How's it going with you and Bengt? -Fine. How's it going with you and what's his name, Nils? Forget about him. Something about single mothers deter men from lengthy relationships. Do you remember saying you'd come back to work? We'll see. Not right now, at least. -I have to get going now. -It was nice of you to babysit him. No! God damn all these drills! I can't stand sitting in the shelter with the kid for hours. Peter! Hurry! -What's going on?! -Bombs have been dropped. -Real bombs? -Yes, as far as we know. We haven't gotten any details, so I can't answer anything else right now. Bengt will be furious when I get home this late. Oh my god, Annika! There could be war up there and you worry about what Bengt will say when you get home! -He doesn't know where I am! -Get a grip! All clear. It was an unidentified aircraft which made a navigational error. Bengt? I accidentally dropped it. Where have you been? I asked where you've been. Did you bring the kid with you? Why do you have to be a nursemaid? Surely Berit can handle the kid herself? -Can't she just leave us alone? Huh? -She's my friend. Like hell she is. She's a whore who'll spread her legs for anyone! I don't want you around her! Annika, I want her to leave you alone! We have our life and she should stay out of it! Stop picking at that servant's mirror! Stop it! I'm sorry, Annika. I've been waiting all night for you to call. I was so worried. Annika, I just want it to be you and me. Did you cut yourself? Yes. I'm sorry, Annika. I'm sorry, Annika. -What's happened? -It's the German. -Franz? -He hanged himself. We found him in the root cellar. Are you bringing new kitchen staff? It's about time. Look at the dregs they send us! Look at these rejects! The staff are lower quality than the ingredients. And no one stays with me. They either get married, or start having kids. -Now they've started hanging themselves. -Hi. -What's this? -Sorry, we have to go to Bengt's parents. Hi. - Do what you have to do, I'll try to arrange something. -Did you know Franz had a daughter? -You can't leave that damn kid here. This is a workplace, not a home for bastard children! Don't worry, I wouldn't leave my child here if it was the last place on earth. Special news broadcast from TT. A large Allied invasion of France has according to German news telegrams begun this morning. Turn it off! Did you know Franz had a daughter in Germany? And what's wrong with you? Why don't you have a kid of your own? Can't your director manage something so simple? Huh?! Is he not man enough for that? I'm really sorry. I have to say I admire Dad. He's always seeing opportunities. I'm sure things will work out, as long as Dad gets the right contacts and we terminate all business dealings with Germany. Our transactions with Germany have always felt a bit... It's weird that the Germans, with their order and discipline, can't maintain their delivery schedules. I wonder how serious Dad's illness is. I don't think Mom tells me everything. -Maybe I could call the hospital. -No, it's not that serious. But of course you should call if you're worried. Open, German bastard! Traitor! Nazi bastard! Come out here! -Come on, guys, let's go in. -German swine! -That's enough! -Calm down, Harald. -Leave them alone. That's enough. -German swine! The police, guys! Let's go! -How are you? -Hi. -You're bleeding. -No, no, it's nothing. Annika! Hey, the war will soon be over. Then I'll head out and see the world. Will you come with me? Run along before the police get here. Hurry. See you. You look beautiful. Annika, can you help me with the bowtie? I can't go out tonight. I see. Why not? Dad has gotten much worse. I have to go home. Oh. Is it that bad? I didn't realize. -When are you leaving? -Tomorrow morning. The first train. -I have to pack my suitcase. -Annika... Would you be terribly upset if I...? I have an awful lot on my plate. Dad is going to America with the trade delegation and we... We have to try to find new markets in case Germany falls. I'm doing this for us, it's for the family. I understand that you're busy. -I'm sorry. -Don't touch me! Nice to see so many people. This will be fun. Ella! It's been a long time since we had this many people at a party. Are we getting cake as well? How tasty. I'll have some of that. -Ella, we should do this again. -Please sit down, Grandpa. Fill the farm with joy, laughter, dance and all that. Help yourselves. What about Olof? Where's Olof? Isn't he going to join us? He's out working, of course. He could use some peace-- Can't Grandpa shut up for once?! Dear friends. The time has come for us to thank Mrs. Gustavsson for arranging this memorial service and gathering family and friends after the burial. It is of course important to stick together during life's difficult moments. Yes, I think so. I think we all wish to surround Mrs. Gustavsson with warm thoughts, and pray that she will have the strength to face the coming days of loneliness and loss. Let us not forget the words of Paul. "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." Amen. He's preparing for the great cold. He might be the happiest of us all. Try it on, Annika. -It's nice. -I'll help you. -It must have been expensive. -Insanely expensive. I want you to have it. Everything will be fine, Annika. Here's the glogg. Let's have a toast. Cecilia! Cecilia! Let's toast to my son and I having managed to avert a looming disaster. -Here we are. -There won't be any speech, I promise. I just want to say this: Thanks to hard work, Bengt and I have, at the eleventh hour, managed to find new suppliers and new markets. And there's every reason to believe that the rebuilding process in Europe will result in new great successes for our small company. Thank you, Bengt. And cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Merry Christmas! -How's the apartment? -Fine. That's great. - Isn't that great? Now that things have settled down at the company, I'm really hoping that you can help me get a grandson. -Promise me that. -We'll do our best. I wish you could stay here tonight. We could open a bottle of wine, and eat some meatballs I borrowed from the kitchen. Wouldn't that be nice? Bengt has invited some business acquaintances and their wives. I'm sick of dinner parties. I wasn't born to be a hostess. Some other time. - Peter! Peter! There you are. Peter. He can't breathe, Annika! Call an ambulance! He can't breathe, Annika! -I have to ask you to wait outside. -You have let me in there. I'm afraid that's not possible. He was barely breathing. What's wrong with him? -It's probably croup. -Croup? Is that serious? Yes, it can be serious. Why was the ambulance so late, Annika?! Why was it so late, Annika?! Why was it so late?! I am calm. What did you say? Yes, I understand. I know, but you have to-- Bengt, you have to understand-- Yes, yes. Bengt, I don't care about the dinner party! Peter is dying here. You have to understand! -What's happened? -He'll make it. We can go home. Hi. Where the hell have you been?! Answer me! Answer me! There! Here, Annika, is where you were supposed to be tonight! I sat there, and had to listen to the guests' insinuating taunts about what you might be up to that was more important than being here. I called you and explained that I was with Berit. So it's more important to be with those slackers in that damned kitchen than being here with my guests?! Huh?! He almost died, Bengt. Don't you understand? And what difference would that have made? A bastard child more or less. "Life feels empty and meaningless. Bengt doesn't care when I tell him I feel lonely." You don't have anything to complain about! You don't have to do anything. Can't you manage that? Do I have to do that for you as well? "Bengt and I haven't slept together in more than a month." Give me my diary. It's my diary! Nothing here is yours! I understand that you're having trouble. Trouble getting enough. You're a whore, Annika. A cheap fucking slut. And who is Harald? Answer me. I'll teach you, Annika. I'll show you. You're mine! No, Bengt! No! Bengt! No! Drink something. How long were you sitting out there? You're all blue from the cold. -Why didn't you holler? -I didn't want to wake you up. I wasn't sleeping anyway. He's been calling all night. Sometimes crying, sometimes yelling. -Open up! -Take it easy. -No! -Open up! -Annika! -I'll talk to him. No, you can't! I won't let him in. I promise I won't let him in, Annika. I might as well go and talk to him. I promise I won't let him in. -What are you doing? -I want to see Annika. -I just want to talk to her. -She doesn't want to talk to you. Annika! Annika! -I'm here to get Annika. -No, you won't. I demand that you let me into your apartment! Over my dead body. -Can't you try to understand? -What am I supposed to understand? This is untenable. She doesn't know what she's doing. She has to come home with me. The law is on my side. Does the law say that you can beat her senseless if you don't like something? This is between me and Annika. You shouldn't interfere. -Yes, I will. It's my damn obligation. -Oh god. I've tried to stay out of your relationship, but there are limits. But know this, she'll never be your wife until she decides to be. She's my wife and I'll do whatever I want with her. And I'll never give up. -Good luck. -I'll never give up! I have to leave. -There's a small hole, but you can fix it. -Will you have any left? Yes, several pairs. Hurry, it's almost eleven o'clock. Three sandwiches, coffee and chocolate. You can read these, I've already read them. Special news broadcast from TT. Germany has surrendered unconditionally. Colonel General Jodl, the new Chief of the German General Staff, signed the instrument of surrender on Germany's behalf. Grand Admiral Dönitz has ordered all combat units to surrender. There is peace in Europe. Streamers and paper shreds are pouring down onto Kungsgatan. Hundreds of people are reaching out from offices. Everyone's cheering and happy. The news of victory has spread. No one is thinking about work at hundreds of Stockholm offices. The cheers drown out everything. Norwegian flags all over the place. Never before has one people participated in another people's joy like now. Long live the King! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Peace! Peace! Long live the King! There's peace!
