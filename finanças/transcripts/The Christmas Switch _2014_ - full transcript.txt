- Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. Find the Santa. Make a fortune. Who's gonna win some money? Let's go, let's go. It's real simple, guys. All you gotta do is turn over old Saint Nick and Christmas comes three weeks early. Who wants to go first? Let's go, step right up. - Wait a second, I think I can beat this guy. - Dad, come on, the shops are gonna close soon. - Here we go. What do you say, kid, huh? Put your money down right there under the rock, huh? Remember, follow the Santa, follow the Santa. Here we go. Keep your eye on the Santa. One, two, three, here we go. There they are. Where's Santa? Come on, come on, come on. - I'm pretty sure it's that one right there. Yeah. - Hey, we got a winner, huh? Pay the kid, what do you got there, 200? There we go. Merry Christmas, merry Christmas. - That's the one I would have picked, watch. Here we go, which card is it gonna be? - That's our Christmas money. Hey, butt out, kid. All right, Dad, what's it gonna be, huh? Find the Santa, find the Santa. All right. Oh, hey, no Santa this year, huh? - Hey, you gotta give me another chance. That money was for Christmas presents. - What do I look like, a charity, huh? You want a hand out, head down the Salvation Army. Get out of here. - Not so fast. - What does the Santa say, huh? - Hey. - Hey, take it easy. Taxi. - Stop that guy, he's got my money. Taxi. - Now, remember what I told you. - Sure, Doc. - Goodbye, Sam. - Thanks, Doc. - If you can argue half as well as your old man, you'll be on the Supreme Court in four years. - Yeah, I just, he had such shortness of breath, I got nervous. - Mm-hmm, well that's why bed rest is the best possible thing Sam can do right now. You know, your dad has a heart as big as New York, but his body is trying really hard to put that heart in a box, so it has to work harder to get blood to the brain. - Thank you. - And lock him in there if you have to. - Oh right, that's easier said than done. You know my father. This is his favorite time of year. - Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. Bed rest, Sam. I've gotta run. - Yeah. - And walk me to the entrance. - Merry Christmas. Better not cry. Better not shout. Where is it? Ah-ha, there. Yeah. Ooh. - Dad? You okay? You never do tidy up after yourself, do you? Sam? Sam, are you really sleeping? I guess you are. Guess that means you won't mind if I throw out this old Santa outfit since you won't be needing it this Christmas. - Oh, honey, wait, what? What's going on? - You know what's going on. There is no Santa Clause this year. The doctor gave you strict orders to stay inside and get rest and that's exactly what you're gonna do. - It's just one man's opinion. - Here, Dad, take your medicine. No, don't worry, it'll pass. - No, Dad. Here. You have got to learn to start taking care of yourself. - Sue, Sue, would you stop with that already? You're making me dizzy, running around here. - Well, I guess I inherited your gene for hard work, didn't I? - But you know, hard work is not everything if... - Oh, Dad, please, no speeches right now. You know I'm studying for the bar. You know I'm just trying to prioritize, okay? Work first, play later, that's the way I've always been. - Sweetheart, you're doing great. Really. You always have. Now, seeing as you're standing, would you mind just bringing me that Santa suit? - Okay, I get it. - No, no. - Okay. - I just wanna show you something. Please. Please. Yeah. Yeah. Now, did you ever look closely at an old Santa's outfit? No, I can't say I have. Well, you can discover some interesting things like there it is, see? Your mother patched that about 15 years ago. She was always good with a needle and thread. - I insisted on keeping the old outfit and she insisted that the kids weren't gonna see an old tattered Santa. You know what she said? "Mrs. Clause would be very angry." Now, I remember one winter. It was so cold that before I got to the store, this beard had just frozen solid. Did I ever tell you a time that I'd lost a beard? Now, that... When, when? That was... - Dad. Hey. Get some rest, okay? - Okay. - There you go. - Thanks, honey. I'll put this back right over here. - Ho ho ho, merry Christmas. So, young dude, what do you want Santa here to enact for you for Christmas? - You're not Santa. - You're insane, dude. I'm the most genuine Santa you're ever gonna experience. Don't go starting any false rumors about who I'm not. Gonna ask you one more time. What do you want for Christmas? - Santa Clause doesn't talk to children that way. - Is there any problem? Yeah, your Santa here. - Jeez, you're so sensitive. - Look, if you can't get a real Santa to play Santa Clause, I'm gonna do my shopping on the internet. I mean, what happened to the nice Santa that you had last year? - Hey, hey, I'm nice. - Well, you see, Sam was getting a little old, so we thought young Liam here would be good for kids. - I'm out of here. Later, dudes. - Looks like you'd better get Sam back here. - Wait. We have specials. Mechanical toys. - Mr. Oakville, this is the 21st century Santa. Now, don't be concerned that it's not human because this baby will outsell any Santa before it. Okay. How does it work? - Ah, that's the beauty of it. You see, a child sits on Santa's lap. We strategically place the father and mother over here. Now, as the child tells Santa what they want for Christmas, a video plays, demonstrating the toy. Both parents and child are impressed. A quick motion from Santa. He takes their credit cards, cash, or checks. Also, gives them their delivery dates and pickup dates, but most of all and what really makes this work is that now, every child is on Santa's private mailing list, which means that for the next 364 days, we are gonna hit them with every piece of junk mail we can find. Now, there's a merry merry Christmas. - You're a genius. That's genius. Barbara, you gotta see this. We are going to have fully exclusive rights to an automated Santa. - George, we need to talk. Ho ho ho. Hey, Eddie, where you been? - Forget about it, I just had to ditch those two cops, right? - Oh man, that was close, but it was worth every penny. Look at that, baby. I got us the big box of wine today. - All right. - Yo, Eddie. I heard you pulled that reindeer scam again. - Oh yeah, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, baby. Works every time. So Mister Three Card Money, when you gonna let us in on this thing? Or is it always gonna be some big secret? - I don't know, reindeer trick, it takes a lot of practice. - Practice? Yeah, especially when you pull it on little kids. You got no heart, man. - You know what, I'm gonna show you this trick one time just 'cause we're good friends. - Oh yeah? That's all it should take for you to figure it out, right? - Sure. - One time? - Yeah. - All right. Let's see it. - All right, big guy. - Yeah, go 'head. Let's see it. - Smart guy. All right. - Man, is he fast. - What do you think? Tell me where it's at. - That one right there. Damn. Which one is he under anyway? - Hey, that's my secret, my secret. - I know you palm that Santa, Eddie and I'm gonna figure it out too. - Well, it could be or maybe people just can't find Santa anymore. Ooh. - What's missing here, George? Shoppers, George. Scared away by punk Santa and off buying online because we can't give them the one thing that they've been coming to Toy Town for for 50 years. What is that? - Christmas? - Sam, George. Santa Sam. - Okay, but I thought that if we got a young, hip Santa, the kids would relate to that. - The parents want a Santa. An old-bearded Santa. - Yes, but a young Santa would... - George. After your father passed and you approached my hedge fund for financing to keep this archaic marketing concept called a store going, I wanted no part of it, but my partners convinced me that this small vintage boutique Toy Town with a celebrity icon could be successfully franchised, George. Think Colonel... - Chicken. - Colonel Chicken, yes, and that we could challenge the internet and the big box stores, right? Now, we have a huge amount of capital tied up here and our Colonel Chicken, which is Sam, has gone AWOL. - Well, Sam is very sick. - Just do whatever it takes to get him back in that chair. - I don't see what I can do. - Incentivize him. Beg, lie, tie him up, I don't care, but I want Santa Sam back in that chair by noon tomorrow or you and I are going to have a very punk Christmas in hell, understand? - Yeah. - Good. George, do it now. - He's been at it for, like, three hours. He's never gonna get it. Okay, find the Santa, find the Santa. - I picked the Santa, I picked the Santa. - Give it back. You got lucky. Think you're so smart, try it yourself. How's it going over there? It's going just great, thanks. Hiding the Santa? Yeah. - You're right, he's never gonna get it. Not unless you work with him. Why won't you show us the reindeer scam, Eddie? I don't understand. - Just protecting my interest. Trick can be dangerous in the wrong hands. - You know, some people might call that greedy. - Maybe, but when I decide to quit, I'm gonna retire that trick for good. - Quit? What, are you gonna skip out on me now? Yeah, but not before we make our first million, baby. Okay, Rudolph, here's to you. - Ho ho ho. Yes. - Yes? Hello? - Hi, Susan. I'm Barbara Morgan and this is George Oakville. We're from Toy Town. We'd like to see your father. - Well, I'm sorry, he's sleeping. - Okay. Let's just get to the point. We are prepared to not only triple his salary, but we understand that you're a law student and we are prepared to offer you some financial compensation to pay for some expenses to start you off in your career. - All right now, sweetheart. Take your time. Remember how much it means to me to be able to see those kids again. The answer's no. - You don't even want to think it over. - My father is very ill. He can't have any unnecessary stress in his life right now. Doctor's orders. - Susan, we're not asking him to work a 12 hour day. Just a couple of hours here and there to show the parents that their good old Santa is back in town. - We'll have a backup Santa and doctor standing by 24/7. - Mr. Oakville, my father's health is not for sale. - Maybe we should let Sam decide that. We'd like to see him. - Yeah. - Please leave and by the way, if you do manage to get in touch with my father and somehow convince him to return, I will let every media outlet in the city know that Toy Town went out of its way to jeopardize the health of a very sick old man just to increase its bottom line. Are we clear? - You're gonna make a great lawyer. You have what it takes. - And give Sam my best. - George. - Yep. - So that's it. Well. I gave it my best shot. So this is really it, huh? I guess it had to come sooner or later. I was just hoping it'd be, you know, a lot later than sooner, but I mean, I'm not complaining, you understand. It's just that, well, it seems like such a shame to put this away, you know? I had the lining redone. There's a new collar on it. Even had it dry-cleaned. Okay, okay. You can't blame me for trying, huh? I just thought that if there was anyone who could get this rickety old body to play Santa one more time, it's you. I mean, what would it hurt? I've done it for almost 50 years and I have never missed one Christmas, no matter how much snow or rain or sleet. I, I mean I'm a regular postman for the North Pole mail, so what do you say? From one old Santa to another, huh? Let me play Santa Clause one more time. Let me just make a difference in a few kid's lives. Even just one kid. Please. - I'm telling you, you don't have to run a scam to make money this time of year, okay? It's Christmas time. All you need to do is a little ho ho ho and money practically falls out of people's wallets. - Ho ho ho? - Yeah. Ho ho ho. - Ho ho ho. - That's it, ho ho ho. - Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. - Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Who the hell are you? - Mind if I warm up a little? It's cold in here. Preparing for Christmas? - What's it to you, you some kind of cop? - Mind if I have a word with you, Eddie? - How do you know my name? - I knew he had another partner. - I think we should talk in private. - Watch my gun. I'm cool. Al put you up to this? No. Let's just say I've been watching you for a long time. - Yeah. - Yeah. You're very good at what you do. - Yeah, pretty well known. - It's not a compliment. The problem is you're too good. You've dug yourself into a deep hole, Eddie, and that reindeer scam is not gonna get you out of it. - How do you know about... You're a cop. Listen, I'm not talking to anybody till I talk to my lawyer. - I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you. - Okay, you can start by letting go of my arm. - Sorry. I'm here to make you a proposition, a gamble, if you like. I'm willing to offer redemption in exchange for a favor. - A favor? - All you have to do is loan your body for three weeks to an old man whose only wish is to play Santa Clause one last time. - Loan my body? What are you, some kind of grave digger? - Eddie, this man is not strong enough to play Santa. He'll die if he does, which is why we need your body for a while. Look at what we're offering in exchange. Redemption. You know, I might consider it if you made it $1,000,000. It can be arranged. - You can do that? Three weeks and it's yours. Is that worth the gamble? - Hey, Manny. Get over here. I think we got our million bucks. The old man right... Hey, buddy, where'd you go? - Hey, you sure you don't know this guy, Eddie? - Yeah, I swear to you. I'd never seen him before in my life. - Okay, sure. Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. What would you like from Santa this year? Water baby. I want a mermaid water baby, ballerina water baby, fabulous water baby, cheerleader water baby. Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. What would you like from Santa this year? - I told you, water baby. Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. What would you like from Santa this year? Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. What would you like from Santa this year? Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. What would you like from Santa this year? Merry Christmas. - George. - Yeah, baby. Gettin' beat. I'll use it. Eddie, put that down. - Look, I'm not kiddin', okay? I've been thinking about you and you want my body. You know, you're probably part of some witch cult or something like that. - Just the opposite. - Yeah, I'm warning you. Ow, ow. How'd you do that, you some kind of magician or something? - Don't be scared, Eddie. I just wanna know if you're going to take my deal. - Really? You're serious about this, aren't ya? - Oh yes, yes we are. However, as your advisor, I'd have rather you'd chosen redemption, but then what can I do? I'm only an advisor. You have free will, Eddie. You have to make the final choice. - But why me? - Well, it's simple. Everyone has a chance at eternity, no matter how good or despicable they've been. Christmas is just a reminder that that chance is always there. That's how he works. Oh. You know what, you almost had me with this magician stuff and the money that I want. How'd you do that? - Sam. Sam. - What? - We're here to grant your wish. - Wait a second. You know what, this whole body switching thing, you're nuts. You know what, I wanna see $1,000,000 right now. Hey. - These are the terms to be agreed upon. You, Eddie Bennett, will give your body to Sam Wells for three weeks. During that time, you will occupy his body and do your best to maintain his health. At exactly 12:00 midnight Christmas Eve, we will return you to your body and the sum of $1,000,000 will be yours. Is that clear? Yeah. - Eddie, you have one more chance. You could choose redemption. - I'll take the million dollars. Ready? - Ready. Hey, take care of this body, huh? It's the only one I got. - Don't worry, son. - Listen up, people. We're only able to accept applicants with at least several years Santa experience. That means able to sit at least one child on each leg and no matter what, no tattoos. - Woah. Ooh. Oh. So this is what it feels like to be an old geezer, huh? Boy. Oh, do you look rough. No wonder you wanted Eddie. God. Skin feels like sandpaper. Never mind. Just think about the million dollars. That's what's important. The million dollars. Still there. Where, where am I? Huh. Manny. Sit. I gotta call Manny. Yeah. - Yes, yes, yes, baby. Yes, I told you. Come on, give me that. All of it? - All of it. Hello? - Manny, it's Eddie. - No, Eddie's not here. - No, Manny, I am Eddie, okay? This is Eddie. - Eddie, you sound terrible. You got a cold or something or is it this phone? Yeah, sort of. - Eddie, I think you'd better take care of that thing. - Yeah, I know, I know. Listen, Manny, I need you to come here as quickly as possible. Don't ask why. Let's see. Oh, this is so lame. This guy's blind too. Let me, hold on. Yeah. The address. Hey, write this down. - 45 West 75th Street. - Apartment 134. - Manny, listen. We play our cards right here, we are getting away with $1,000,000. You got that? Dad? Dad? - A daughter. Manny, I gotta go right now, but get here as soon as possible. I got a surprise for you. Dad, you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm just resting. - Let's let a little light in here, huh? - Wow. So you're the daughter. - And you're the father, remember? Yeah, right. I'm just kidding. - Listen, Dad, I've only got a few minutes. I'm meeting my bar partner back at the library. - Really, you can drink at the library now? - Dad, are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - I'm a little worried about you. - No, no. You go off to the bar. I'll be fine. - Okay. I'll be back by seven. You know how to reach me, right? - Yeah. Remember, my new cell phone number? I left it written down for you last week? - Oh. - Here, give it to you again here. You can call me on that and if I'm in the library, I'll call you back in a minute, okay? Next. Name. - Sam, Eddie Bennett. - No, no, you're way too young. - Yes, but I wanna be young. - Yes, we all wanna be young, but not Santa. Santa's old and fat and jolly and you're not it. Thank you. Try again in another 10, 15 years. - Yes, but I only have... Will you show him out please? Thank you. - Well, Santa, they're just gonna have to see you in action. Home sweet home. - Nobody's right, nobody. Aren't there any good Santas left? - Barbara, we have to hire someone. - Yes, I know we have to hire someone, but first, we have to do some damage control. We messed up, we completely damaged Santa's image and I think that this store has an obligation to restore that image to our customers. The next person that we pick for Santa has to be absolutely perfect. Must epitomize the very meaning of Christmas and then... - They'll buy our toys. - Exactly. What the hell do you think Christmas is about? Don't answer that. Don't you have something to do? Quietly. Well, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho ho. Who's next, come on up and tell Santa what you want for Christmas? - I'd rather stand, thank you. - Okay. - My size and color selection are included as well as quantity. These are all for you? - She's very competitive. - You know, sometimes, quality is better than quantity. - Why? Isn't it better to have more than less? That's what Daddy says. The more money you make, the more you have. The more you have, the happier you are and I wanna be very happy for Christmas, Santa. Well, we all do, but if you want Santa's help, you'll have to sit up here as I tell you a story. Okay, fair trade. - You know, when I first started delivering presents, I would get letters from many children all around the world asking for their favorite toy and some would ask for two. Some would ask for three and some would even ask for hundreds. Now, what's a Santa to do? If I were to deliver hundreds of toys to one child, then another child would have nothing. - Nothing? Nothing. - Couldn't you hire more elves and make more toys? - Well, you see that's the problem with Christmas. There's only so many elves to make so many toys and we all want to be happy for Christmas, right? - This is definitely a problem. Maybe we should each take a little less so we can all have more for Christmas. - Well, that sounds like a grand idea. - You can keep my list. It might help you pick toys for the other children. - That makes Santa very happy. - 'Kay, Mommy, we're finished. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho ho ho, merry Christmas. - George, I don't know what to do about this Santa. I can't find anyone to play him. - I don't know what you're talking about. I think he's doing fine. Who? - Santa. He's great, kids love him. That's not our Santa. - Then who's is he? - Come on, George. - But I've been watching him for an hour. - Call security. I'm gonna put a stop to this. - Look, there's a big line for him. That's because their Santa hungry, that's all. - Merry Christmas. George Oakville. - Yes. - Hi. My mother used to bring me here as a child. - Oh, fantastic. - I want to thank you. - You do? - Yes, that Santa is incredible. He was willing to lose sales just to teach my daughter the meaning of Christmas and that means I'm gonna be shopping here for a long, long time. - Merry Christmas. - Me too. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Come on, come on. And what is it you'd like for Christmas this year? - Manny. - Oh, excuse me, I'm looking for Eddie Bennett. Yeah, that's me, Manny. I'm Eddie. - No, no, I'm looking for Eddie Bennett. He's 35, really good with the cards. - Yeah, yeah, that's me. Come on, get in here. - Yeah, listen, old man. Maybe with the senile thing you think you're Eddie, but you're not, so how do you know him? - Manny, look. It's me. I'm just in a different body, that's all. I know it's hard to believe, but I am in here really. I'll prove it to you. I was born May 15, 1979, okay? My neighborhood 96 to 100 Street, Columbus Avenue, PS 68. I was kicked out in grade 10 and my father left when I was seven. My mother, you know, just left and I learned card tricks from the best in the business. There's no one as good as me. You ask anyone on the street, they'll tell ya. - What's your best scam? - You know, the reindeer scam. No one can do that but me. - Yep, that's true. So if you are really Eddie, show me the Rudolph trick. I don't know whether I could do that. I'm in a different body now and these hands aren't as nimble. Besides, I didn't bring any cards along. I left them in my pant's pocket, so the other guy took 'em. - I always carry any extra set, partner. Haven't you forgotten something? - Okay. Ho ho ho, merry Christmas. Find the Santa and win a fortune. Merry Christmas, you satisfied? Aw. - Oh, oh hey, hey, hey. Enough, enough. I don't know what your game is, okay? But where's Eddie? Hey, Eddie. Come on out, buddy. Hey. Manny, come on. I am Eddie. But you can't do the reindeer trick. - Yes, I can, but I need Eddie's body. But it's just that there's two Eddies, don't you understand? There's me, Eddie, and then there's Eddie's body, like we're separate, but you know, we're the same thing, but I, I can't do the tricks as Eddie unless I've got Eddie's body, right? - Uh, I guess not, but still, you can't do the trick and that's Eddie. I mean, I don't know about your body or mind or whatever you're talking about, but Eddie is that trick, so I'll be seeing you, old man. - Hey, bro. Find the Santa. Come on. Ah-ah. Eddie. It really is you. Buddy. You look terrible. - Thanks. - I hope I didn't offend you before. I mean, what's a couple of years amongst Santas? - No, not at all. I can understand your reaction. And so reasonable too. - Yes, very reasonable. - So let's get down to it. As you can see, we are prepared to offer you a very generous salary and of course, we pay double and triple for overtime. - Oh, I don't want a salary. No salary? - I get it. You want a percentage of the gross. - No, no salary, no percentage of anything. I just, I wanna play Santa until Christmas and I hope that Toy Town would make a donation to a couple of charities, my choice. That would be sufficient. - Mm-hmm. Tax write-off. Well, we don't see a problem at all. - No, none at all. In fact, let me be the first to welcome you to our little family and in the parlance of our times, go get 'em. - Thank you, Mr. Oakville, Ms. Morgan and merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, merry Christmas. There is a Santa. - Yes. Yes, there is and a good one. - Oh man. I can't explain what this being old feels like. I'm me, but I'm not me. - Yeah, I know that feeling. Believes me, runs in my family. Eddie, you gotta take care of yourself. You're older now. - Hey, don't be a smart ass. I'm still 35, I'm still Eddie, okay? Anyway, we got other problems. I don't trust these guys, especially the old man. Once he gets a taste of youth, he may not wanna give my body back. Oh yeah. Hey, you got a point. - Damn right. I need you to keep one eye on him so he doesn't run away with me, got it? - Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna check out Toy Town. Hang on a second, how do I recognize this guy? - It's easy, he looks just like me. The real Eddie. Hey. I need to get some fresh air. Come on. Help me down the stairs. Here we go. Yeah. - Here we go. Got your favorite. Cabbage soup. Oh, just my luck. - What? - Uh, can't wait. Cabbage soup is good for you, Dad. - Yeah, okay. Uh-huh. Absolutely wonderful. What's all this? - Huh? Oh, I missed. - Yeah, more than once it looks like. Wait a second, did you take your medicine today? - Yeah, I think so. What are you so worried about? - You went out today? - So? - So you promised you wouldn't go out alone, Dad. - What are you, the nurse from hell? - How can I trust you now? I can't leave you alone. - What do you mean? You gotta leave me alone. You can't, no, I mean, you can leave me alone because I'll stay right in this bed and take all my medicines, promise. - And how many times have you promised that before? - Never. Well, I mean, those promises, they weren't real promises, but this time, this is a real promise. I'm going to do everything you say. - You'll take all your medicine. - Sure. Starting tonight. - Yeah. - Okay. Then I guess we'll start with the home remedy. Open up. Hey, Manny, where you been? Christmas shopping. Who's money? Very funny. - You see Eddie? - Partly. Louie and I did. You did? Where? I thought you didn't know. Eddie's always been getting over on us. Now he's getting over on you too. Pulling an inside job. - What? - Playing Santa at Toy Town. The toy store? - Actually pretty smart when you think about it. The cops are on the outside looking for him on the streets and he's on the inside and they're lining up and he's making money. I don't know how, but he is. Give me three. Thing about it is, this time, he ain't gonna forget about his partners. You know why? 'Cause this time we know where Santa is. - Ho ho ho. Bam. Okay. - Wow, that was something. One last thing. Oh, of course. - Here you go. Good. Now I don't have to worry about you tonight. - Oh, I'm fine. Listen, why don't you go out or something? - Or something? I think we know how the last or something ended up. How's that? - Mr. Right on paper, Mr. Wrong in every other way? Yeah, yeah. - You know what'd be nice before I go back and study in my little shoe box apartment? What's that? - Why don't we read a little poetry like the good old days? - Poetry? I'm not sure I could take the excitement. - Hey, you wrote the stuff. Do you remember this one? Skates on Ice? You wrote that when I lost that skating competition. - You lost? - Oh, come on. I fell so hard that day. You must have had a sore booty. - Not as sore as my pride, I can tell you that. I never told you this, but one of the times that I fell, I was just gonna lay there. I was gonna get all dramatic and pretend that I broke my leg or something and I remember looking up and seeing you in the stands doing one of these and I knew right then and there that I didn't have to be embarrassed. I didn't have to feel sorry for myself, that I just, just had to get back up. - Yeah, sure, and you finished real strong. - What are you talking about? I fell eight more times. Oh yeah. Well... - But the point is, you always made me feel that if I made a mistake, if I did something wrong, that I could just get back up. That meant a lot to me. - I don't know what to say. You're welcome. - Where were we? - No, no, no, I get the point. Look, why don't you go off and study? You sure? - Sure. I got some reading to do of my own. Catch up on what I wrote, huh? All right, well, don't forget your glasses. - Woo. Hey. You really love me, don't you? - Yeah. You're my dad. - Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm your father. - 'Scuse me. Sorry, I got to talk to Santa over here. Sorry. - Well, I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful Christmas. - Ooh, this is a miracle. - Merry Christmas to you. Okay, who's next? Come on, don't be shy. - I mean, I couldn't believe it. There you are. I mean, there's this guy, Sam, and he's sat inside your body and he's bouncing these kids up and down on your knee. - Man, are you serious? - Yeah, but you looked beautiful, Eddie. I mean, these kids loved you. Really? - Yeah. What about Sam? - He looked fine, I mean, he looked like he was really enjoying himself. - Oh yeah, that's what I was worried about. Listen, Manny, I really need you now. If I'm gonna get me back and we're gonna get that money, you gotta keep watching this guy all the time. I wanna know where he's living, what his work hours are, everything. I don't want the dude thinking he's discovered the fountain of youth, you know? - You got it. I'm gonna watch this guy that looks like you, but is Sam. Like a hawk. - And report to me every day, okay? See, when I get a little stronger, you and I are gonna pay this guy, Sam, a little visit, see? - Yep. All right, money. - Ooh. This is incredible. We are killing the big box stores. - And the internet. - And it's all because of Santa, but of course, we won't tell him that and no one will see these printouts. Who knows what kind of donation he'd ask? - I just came by to say thank you again and good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Sorry. - Something about that guy. Toy Town is closing in 15 minutes. Take your purchases up to the cash register now. - Hello, Eddie. How's the Santa Clause business? - I think you might have the wrong fella. Very funny, Eddie. Look, it's one thing you're not telling us about the reindeer scam. It's something else you're not cutting us in on a big job like this. - I'm just, I'm playing Santa, that's all. - Eddie. Always scamming. - Hey. Now, one more time. What's the deal? When's it going down and how much you gonna cut us in for? - The deal? The deal is Santa listens to the kids and hopefully teaches them about the magic of Christmas. That way, they don't turn out like thugs like you two. - Oh, that hurts, Eddie. That really hurts. Talk to him. - Eddie, when you palm that Santa, do you use the left or do you use the right? That's it. Hey, Manny. Manny, get over here, help us out. Explain to him that we need to know what's going on. We just want him to level with us. - Hey, Eddie. That you? It's me, Manny. - Hey, Manny. It's good to see you. - Oh, this stinks. You're in on this too. - No, look, there's a really simple explanation, okay? - You know what, I've given you enough chances. Hey, Eddie, I've been wanting to do this for a long time. - Hey, hey. Woah. - Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. Look, there's a really simple explanation. I'm telling you. - This Sam guy's a pretty good writer. What the? Manny. Why didn't you come around the front? - I was worried about that daughter of yours. - She's not my daughter, Manny. - Yeah, okay, okay, his daughter. - Well, you could have at least called. - Yeah, I would've, but they wouldn't let me. They? - Yeah. Oh no. Jeez. - Eddie, I... Eddie, listen, I can explain the whole thing, okay? - Never mind, forget it. Look at this. Guess maybe Manny was telling the truth. - Yeah, it's crazy. All this body change and stuff. - I gotta say, you're looking really good, Eddie. - Really good. - Yeah, it is me, Al. If you want proof, I'll do the reindeer trick. - Nah, nah, your partner here wouldn't lie to me. So what do you want? - What do you think we want? We wanna be your partners, but this time, on this million bucks you're getting for the body switching scam. - Hey, this is my money. I'm taking the risk. But we're your partners. No, you're not. I thought I had a partner, but believe me, Al, it wouldn't be you. - Al said you'd be like this. - Show him. Cops are looking for you. - Go 'head, read it. You're in a lot of trouble, Eddie. Or should I say your body's in trouble? See, if you don't bring us in on this million bucks, we're gonna bring your body to the cops and then your body's gonna be thrown in jail and you're gonna be stuck here in this thing. - Good luck. - Take it easy, old man. - It's very simple. You cut us in. We make sure nobody touches you. You keep us out, well. - Okay. Come back Christmas Eve, midnight. That's when I get the money and you'll get your share. - Okay, partner. Let's go. - Listen, Eddie, I can explain the whole thing to you, okay? - Hey, you heard what I said. Come back Christmas Eve, now get out of here. Oh man, what have I done? Without Manny, I won't know what's going on. I could be, I could be kidnapped. I could be held for ransom. I wouldn't even know. - Dad. You're up? - Oh yeah, I'm feeling awesome. Really good. See, I took all the pills and drunk the milk. I've eaten all the breakfast. - Have to say, you really did keep your promise this time. - That's right. Now, don't you think your old man deserves just a little bit of a treat for being so good. - Well, what kind of treat do you have in mind? - I wanna go to the toy store. - Oh, come on, Dad, now you're taking advantage. - Advantage, I've been holed up in this dump for a week. You're sick. - No, I'm feeling, I'm getting better. I'm looking after myself. - For two days. So? - Now listen, young lady. I am still your father and you owe it to me to hear me out. Now, I have not played Santa this year, which is bad enough, but I've also been taking all kinds of pills with cabbage soup and everything else you've thrown at me just to keep you happy. I mean, I think that I deserve to enjoy a bit of Christmas too. All I want is to go to the toy store for just a little while and meet with people. I mean, is that asking too much for everything I've given up? Okay, Dad. Dad, just a sec, I gotta pay the cab driver. Slow down, Dad. Dad, wait. Dad, slow down. Wait. - Sam? Sam, is that Sam? It's Santa Sam. Oh, Sam. Welcome, it's so good to see you. It's me, Jan Sanjip. - Oh yeah, of course. How you keepin'? Oh, I'm good, good. - Now this, George, is a perfect Christmas. An absolutely perfect Christmas. - Is that Sam down there? - Yeah, it is. - I'm going to say hi. - George, make sure you keep him away from the other Santa. George! Oh, Sam, welcome back. Hi, Sam. - Come on, Sam. Give us your merry Christmas. - Oh, why, it's been a while. I, well, merry Christmas. - Sam. Sam. Welcome back. It's me, George Oakville, the president. - Oh right, President Oakville. - You remember Barbara? - Why wouldn't I? - Mr. Sanjip, go and check the line up in the village. - It's good to see you, Sam. - Yeah. - Is there anything we can do for you, Sam? - Oh yeah, yeah. I wanna see this new Santa and the kids. - Today, it's a little crowded. How 'bout next week? - No, no, no, that's way too late, man. - Carla? - Yes. - Carla Jensen, what are you doing here? - Came to see Santa. - I would have thought you would have stopped believing in him by now. - I'll always believe in him. He's always gotten me the Christmas presents I want. - I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that. What's that? - I heard he was sick, so I brought him some special tea. - Kid bringing Santa a present? That's a change. - I want him to get better. - So do we all, Carla. So do we all. - Merry Christmas. - Listen, George. This is the last Christmas that he's, that this old body's gonna have and it'd mean a lot to me to see the kids one last time. Make sure your new Santa's doing his job. - He's downstairs, let me take you. Allow me. No, no, no. - Well come on, Sam, you've worked so hard for this store. Let me do something for you for a change. - Merry Christmas. - Well, here he is. - Merry Christmas, ho ho ho ho ho. There's a problem in mechanical toys. - You have yourself a merry merry Christmas. I don't believe it. That's me. - Hello there. Merry Christmas. - Woah. - Dad? There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Dad, are you okay? - That wasn't me in there. - Look, I know how badly you wanted to play Santa this year, but you can't let it tear you up like this. - No, it's not what you think. Then what is it? See, I never saw myself enjoying Christmas like that. - Dad, you've always enjoyed Christmas. - No, not really. - Okay. We gotta get you home. - No, cool it, I, I can't go yet. You gotta take me one more place. This is major for me, I gotta do this. - Okay, Dad, okay. There you go, oop. - Thanks. - You feeling better? - Oh yeah. You know, I always wanted to learn how to skate. - Dad, you taught skating for 20 years. - Really, did I? Oh, I mean, you know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be able to skate. See, I was just like you. All I did was fall down. - I never knew that. You were always so good, I never thought you fell. - Kids often think that about their parents. Maybe they need to get real. - Bah humbug. That's not the Christmas Santa I know. - The Christmas that I remember most, see, there was this one kid. Terrible skater. You know, he'd go two steps, he'd fall down. He'd get up, he'd fall again and my buddies and I thought it was hysterical. We laughed like crazy, but this one night, see, he wouldn't stop skating. He just kept on through the evening, falling down, getting up, falling down. After a while, it wasn't funny anymore, you know? We tried to get him to stop 'cause after all, it was Christmas Eve. I mean, Santa was gonna arrive. There were gonna be presents for everyone, but he wouldn't listen and then just as we were about to leave, his father showed up looking for him and the old man was drunk as usual and chased him around that rink, caught up with him and beat him, pretty bad. That's what Christmas was like in that kid's home. Later on, I figured it out, what was really going on there, see. That kid was just trying to escape. Problem was he didn't know how. - You never told me that story before. Did you know the kid well? - Oh yeah. I knew him very, very well. You, you're beautiful in so many ways. It's true. It's true, anybody would be lucky to have you for a daughter or a friend. - Dad. - And I am just so happy I got to know you. - Dad, stop, you're scaring me. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, will you do me one, just one more favor? Sure. - Skate for me. What, you mean now? - Yeah. I would love to see you fall over a couple of times. It would mean so much to me. Okay. Okay, I'll go get some skates. - Yeah. Let's see. Uh-huh. There. Yes. - Merry Christmas, come on up. Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho. Hello. Well, let's see if we can make that happen. Merry Christmas. - What, where? What day? Calender. I need that. Where's it? Where? There it is. Finally. It's Christmas Eve. Oh yeah. Man, this day will never end. I bet they're slowing down time or something just to put the screws to me. Yeah, hello? Dad. - Ah, Susan. You okay? - Oh, I'm fine. You know I worry. It's just, it's Christmas Eve, you know? And I just didn't know how you'd be taking it, that's all. All right, the library closes by 8:00, so I'll see you after that. You remember how to get in touch with me this time? - Sure. I love you, Dad. - Love you too. - Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho ho ho. Merry Christmas everyone. Toy Town is closing in 15 minutes. Please take your purchases up to the cash register now. - Hello, may I come in? Please, please do. - Thanks. I have a list of charities I'd like for you to make donations to. - Let me see that. Not a problem at all. - I didn't think so. Well, I wanted to thank you for letting me play Santa this year. - You were great. - Thank you, thank you. - Wait a minute. Can we count on you for next year? - Uh, well, I don't think so. I've played Santa long enough. I think it's somebody else's turn. - But you haven't even heard our offer. - Well, I'm not sure. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - He'll be back. - Eddie, hey. Open up, it's an emergency. Yeah. Hey, it's not midnight yet. You get your money then. - Eddie, listen to me. You disappeared. - What? You let him out of your sight. - No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't us. That big guy, he was there and he did some kind of thing and then you, that guy, he was gone. - I knew it. I knew it, this was a setup all along. How could I be so stupid? Look, we gotta find this guy before he gets away with this. - Yeah, I know, but where? I mean, where could he be? - Susan. Susan will know. Okay, but Eddie, look. You gotta chill out. You're gonna get yourself a heart attack. - What do I care? How would you like to be stuck in this thing for the rest of your life? - Dad? - Susan. Yeah, hi, yeah, I'm fine. Listen. Help me out here. What would I be doing on Christmas Eve if I wasn't sick? - Where you'd always go, the children's orphanage. But Dad, why are you asking me this? - Got you, I gotta go, honey. Come on. Hey man, this is one scam I ain't gonna lose. - Dad? Hi, I'd like to report an emergency. Merry Christmas. - Dad? Did you see a guy come here with a leather jacket, dark hair? He's a friend of mine. Hey, which way he'd, over here? Thank you so much. - Manny, stay here. I'll be back with the money and my body. - Yeah, okay. - Well, well. I thought you'd forget us. Come on. - Hey. You guys. You're trying to trick me. - We're here as agreed upon. 12:00 midnight Christmas Eve. Look for yourself. - You should have trusted us, Eddie. - Never mind that. Let's just get on with this. I want my money. Quick, before Susan gets here. You've been doing a lot of running around, Eddie. - Come on, come on, the money. Wow. You all right, old man? - Take care of yourself, son. It's all been worth it. - Thank goodness you're here. - It's all right, sweetheart. Santa is back. We all get equal shares. - Here's your cut. - Why don't you hold it for me? - Oh, come on, man. It's over. We're back in business. Look at all this money. - Think I was too hard on that old man's body? He didn't look so good. - Yeah, to be honest, I don't know. - I don't know either. Where you going? - What's wrong with him? - It's okay. That's personal. All right. Why? - It's all a part of the cycle of life. But his daughter, she needs him. - Most people need someone, Eddie. Sometimes they're lucky enough to find the right person in life. - Yeah, but she's good people. Why should she suffer? - Well, why should you care? You got your million bucks. Go and celebrate. Merry Christmas. - Hey, Eddie. Eddie, where you been? Listen. I wanna thank you. None of this would have been possible without you. - Thanks, Al. You know, it took all this for me to realize what a great bunch of guys you all are too. You know, you made me see things in a whole new light. That's why I think we should take our operation to the next level. I think it's time I let you in on the reindeer scam. - You serious? Are we kiddin'? No, partners. Each and every one of you. - What is it, Eddie? Come on, tell us. - Well, come on, until now, we haven't had the bait for the big score, right? But now we do. So let's pool our money together till each one of us has $1,000,000. Then we put the reindeer scam to bed once and for all, that's it. - I'm in. When do we start? - Tomorrow, Christmas day. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho, merry Christmas. Find the Santa, make a fortune. You ready to win? I think today's gonna be your lucky day. - I've been waiting for this day, Louie. - Follow the Santa, here we go.

It's not what you think, okay? We still got some money left here and you can have it all. - Eddie, that is the craziest scam you ever pulled. - Thought I'd put that trick to rest, huh? Listen, I'll catch up with you later, huh? - Good. - Hi. Hi. Back so soon? - Yeah. I wanted to give you this. I was hoping maybe you could start a Christmas fund or something. - In the name of Toy Town? - In the name of Sam. - Yeah, in the name of Sam. Well, thanks and merry Christmas. - You are coming back next year, right? - I may never know. I just might. - I told ya. They always come back. - Good night, Barbara. - You. - I heard I lost the money, Eddie. Sorry. - Yeah. Figured you can't take it with ya. - You're right. You can't. Well, good luck, Eddie. - Hey. Thanks. - For what? - Figure you guys had this planned out the whole time. Maybe. - Hey, I never got your name. - Nick, just call me Nick. - 'Scuse me. Hi. You're Sam's daughter, Susan? - Yeah. Do I know you? - Oh, not really. I knew your father. I'm Eddie, Eddie Bennett. I played Santa this year for your dad. - Oh right, right, yeah. No, I saw you at the, at the store. - Yeah. I'm really sorry what happened to him. He was a really great man. - Yeah. He used to bring me here every New Year's Eve when I was a little girl. I'm gonna miss him a lot. - You know, I'm kind of starting over and I thought I don't know if you wanted someone to talk to, a friend. - I'm sorry. I'm just really tired right now. - Well, the truth is that Sam said you were a really great skater and when I was a kid, any time I tried to skate, my drunk of a father would beat me pretty bad, so I thought, I mean, maybe you could show me. - The truth is I'm a terrible skater. - You know, I don't care. - Are you sure we haven't met before? Okay. - Nick. Nicholas. Saint Nicholas. Three, two, one. Happy New Year. - Not bad. - Must have practiced a lot, huh? You're good. - Really? - Yeah. - You think? Woah.
