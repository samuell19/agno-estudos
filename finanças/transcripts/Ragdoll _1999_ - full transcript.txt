Or he sure ain't gonna bother us. - [Kwame] Now look, we - Oh, I'm sorry, little rapper, you know who we are, right? - Yeah, you're Big Pere's brothers. - That's right. This big motherfucker over here is Gene, and I'm Little Mikey. So now with you knowing who we are, am I right, you know who we are? - Yeah. - You don't want to be saying, "Now look," to us. What you want to be saying is, "How can I help "you, brother?" - How can I help you brother? - Okay, here's what we gonna do. Ya'll go ahead and pack up all your shit, get your shit, cause we going on a little adventure. Yes, shit. - We ain't going nowhere with you. - No, I didn't say ask Little Mikey some bullshit question! I said, "Get your shit." - [Gene] For sure. - Okay, here we are. Go people, move it. You ever been to Big Pere's before? Of course not. You wouldn't know class if it stepped on you. Oh, these little brat rappers give me a rash. Move it! (soft music) Marvie, how are you? It's good to see you. Glad you can make it. Big Pere's gonna be with you in just a little minute, okay? - If I could talk to him right now. - Why don't you go sit the fuck down at the end of the bar. This is your chair here. What is this, King's Mark, I like what you've done. Is this Japanese? Sit down. Oh, yes. - Teesha, Teesha, look. It's Big Pere. - How ya'll doing? No, no, sit your asses down. That's one talented motherfucker there. Kwame. - Yeah, that's me. - Shoot, I know. You the man to talk to. Am I right? - Talk to about what? - About your hoo, whatever you call it, uh KT, whatever. - Look, man, I don't even know what you're talking about. What do you want from us? - You know me, don't you? - Yeah. - I mean my reputation. - Yeah. (laughs) - Oh, I see, I see, you try to show your balls. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Okay, I see the big motherfucking things, now tuck them back in, why don't you? Okay. Well apart from my reputation being a mean, crazy ass, fat, black cut your heart out and eat it grand motherfucker, I personally think of myself as being in the happy business. You know. Whatever make people happy. Good food, good weed, good piecing. (chuckles) Uh, you know what I mean. But I know what else makes people happy. Music. So, I say to myself, Big K, you know there's some folks you want to be in business with. And you know I'm branching out in all sorts of directions, and I always like to showcase. You know, songs and shit. See that? That ain't empty. That's money in that hand. That's power. That's my brains. My ambition. That hand, that hand hold a whole lot of important shit. And I want you in there. - What? You want us in there? - What do you mean? - He means he wants us to work for him. - Oh, no, no, no, I want to work for you. Next thing you know, I'm going to get you places you never fucking dreamed of. Kwame, come on, motherfucker, put your hand there. Put yourself there. You won't regret it. I guarantee it. - Kwame! - Come on, man, what's the deal? - Come on, Kwame, what you doing? - Look, we got to think about it. - Oh what, you want to weigh my pros and cons, it that it? - Yeah, something like that. - Alright, well, I'm nothing if not reasonable. Ya'll go and think about it. We're just gonna see how it all wash out. Just going to see how it all wash out. You want to hold on just one moment? See, Marvin here's been waiting. Come on, Marvin, let's go talk for a minute. Now, ya'll be cool, alright? I'll be right back. - I don't know man. He seems like a nice guy. - Are you stupid? (stumbling footsteps) (crash) - Damn. (thud) (boom) (thud) (bump) (bam) (yelling and pounding) Let's get the fuck out of here. (yelling and thumps) - You know, Kwame, you ought to talk to somebody about this. - Who? Pastor Charlie? The social worker at school? - I mean the police. - The police. And what are they gonna do? Well? Look, Gran, these guys, Big Pere and his two brothers, they're into everything. Drugs, prostitution, loansharking, murder, everything. Now if the police could do something about them, and I'll make them believe right about now that they even want to do something about them, don't you think they would have already? And if they can't do nothing about them for all of that, what makes you think they gonna swoop their asses on down here and arrest Big Pere because he asked to be our manager? I mean, he didn't even threaten us in so many words. And I'll tell you something, Gran, when you see a guy get his face broke in half, and shoved into a bunch of hot grease, you don't need so many words. - Well, maybe you and Teesha and the others, maybe you ought to just give it up. - Give it up. Why didn't I think of that? Give it up. Yeah. But you know something, Gran? I just don't remember Big Pere offering us that as an option. Jeez. You know, I really wish that stuff you did in your conjuring room really worked. I would love to send some big black magic against Pere right about now. And shove his ass in a deep fryer. Damn him, damn him to hell! (slap) - Now, you listen to me, Kwame. Don't make no mind to me what you think or don't about my conjuring, but the magic's in your blood, same as it's in mine, same as it was in my mama's. And that magic puts power in your words! - Gran. - No, boy. Some things you don't speak lightly. You, you think I, ain't, ain't got spells over in my conjuring room? Magic that can wither a man's limbs, or cause them a cancer, or send out a killing thing? You think I can't do it? I could show you things that'd wither your soul. But it don't come for free. Whatever you do with the art, Kwame, it comes back on you, good or bad. A conjurer can't call up the magic of the killing kind unless he's willing to pay the price. And that ain't a price I'm gonna pay. Nor you neither. - Don't worry, Gran. I ain't looking to your conjuring to solve my problems. It can't hurt nothing, and it can't save nothing. So I guess nothing's about all it's good for. But don't ya'll worry. I'm going to solve my own problems myself. - How, Kwame? Kwame, solve it how? - I'm going to give Big Pere his answer. - So, Big Pere, he's this big time gangster, right? What do we care? We just need somebody to get us out there. Somebody to promote us. - KT, in the house! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What's all these long faces? The crowd is hyped, and ya'll going on in two minutes. Not one, uh uh, but two. Alright? - Alright. [Teesha] Okay. - We'll be there. - In two. KT. - Now. Look, look, look. Maybe it's not so bad. I mean, maybe he can get us this record deal finally. I mean, at least get some airplay or something, come on, ya'll. - Hey, Teesh, you been pretty quiet. What do you say? - What do you want me to say? If we say yes, we lose. If we say no, we lose. When it comes down to it, what can we do? - Sh, Miss Negative over here. - I'm not being negative. - Yes you are. - Come on, ya'll, you act life somebody died. We KT Bounce. Come on, man, let's go perform, besides, I saw some honeys upstairs. Yeah. - That's what I'm talking about. - [Teesha] He doesn't want to either. - You're already there. - [Kwame] You think so?

I want you to kill Big Pere and his two brothers. - I could do that for you. What will you give me in return? - I don't know. Whatever you want. Except for my Gran. If anything else happens to my Gran, then the deal's off. - Agreed. I will take my pay as we go. Here it is. Now, where do we put it? - What is it? - This is the killing magic that you bought. But we got to put it in something. - I don't get you. What do you mean? - We must put it in something bad, Kwame. That will do it. (spooking tinkling music) (Shadow Man groans) (sizzling) - Whah.

Somebody done skinned my brother's face clean off. And I been spending the last couple of days talking to myself about it. How about you, you been spending some time, talking to yourself about it? - No, bitch. I've been too busy celebrating. - You know, balls don't do a man no good when they cut off and sewn to his face, so I'd watch who the fuck I'm talking to! And don't think I don't know about Granny, and her conjuring shit. I know that shit run in the blood, don't think I don't know it. - My Gran ain't got nothing to do that. - Shut the fuck up! Look like Granny here waking up, maybe she got the answer. No, no, no, motherfucker! Sit your black ass down, unless you want me to perform some mean ass brain surgery on grandmother over here. Sit down. Cause you know how I hate needles. You hear that, Granny? Is that what happened? Kwame been playing with the family magic, is that it? - Man, leave her alone! - Shut the fuck up! Is that what he done did? Huh? (growling) What the fuck? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is that? (screams) (demonic shrieks and sounds) (agonized screams) (clunk) (terrified screams) - Then the Ragdoll grabbed onto Little Mikey's face, and they were wrestling around on the ground, and then the Ragdoll stabbed Little Mikey with a bunch of hypodermic, hypodermic needles. And yes, I had Little Mikey's gun, but I didn't use it! - And that's Kwame's statement? - And he signed that? - Yep. - What the fuck you think's going on here, boy? You think this is an X-Files episode? You think you're on a fucking TV show here? Well, let me tell you something, you stupid little motherfucker. Let me tell you something. You ain't going nowhere till I get some sense from you, you hear what I'm saying? Yeah, we'll put your little minor ass in a real jail with the big boys, that's what we'll do with you, how'd you like that? (bang) Dammit you're lucky he's here! Write some shit like that. (thud) (phones ringing) (dispatcher over police radio) - I already told you everything I know. - And I don't even know that. - So, what you're telling me is, Big Pere wanted to be like repping your rap group so bad, that once he makes you sign the contract, he turns around and kills one of you? That's the idea? - Maybe. - Oh, right. Right. He figured that in the whole, wide world, you four kids were the ones that did his brother, Gene. And that's why he did what he did to your friend, Gem. That's the idea. - No, no, the idea is you go ask him. Because I would love to see how you ask Big Pere questions. You do that, "That's the idea" shit with him, or is it more like, "Thank you so much, Mr. Pere "for finding the time to come down, because we have "a few questions we'd like to ask you." Is that the idea? - Girl, you put that shit away! Do you know what land you're in, baby? You're in the defendant shall be tried as an adult land, and that's some bad fucking place to be. Bad for the both of you, and bad for your friend, Kwame. So the next time you open up your mouth, little girl, I don't want to be seeing no fucking attitude coming out of it. - Trial? Trial for what, what the fuck did we do? - Well, boy, that's what we trying to find out. So you be real careful about what you gonna say, cause what you need to be thinking about, is what your friend Kwame is saying about you in the next room. You ever hear that saying, "Last to flip, "takes the trip"? Think about it. I'll be back in a minute. - What's up, babe? Did you get anything? - If they're lying, they're a pair of Robert DeNiros. I don't think they know anything. They're just a couple of kids. - Someone's got to know something. - Mm. It's got to be your boy. Is he coming up with anything? - Yeah, gave us one hell of a statement. You know, the whole damn thing's just weird. I don't know. See, he's not fucking with us, though. It don't see that way anyhow. - Hm? - Hey, do me a favor. Keep playing with those two, alright? They're too close to this shit not to get something splashed on them, he said something, they heard something, something. Alright? - [Woman] Alright. Do what I can. - Alright, thanks. - You know son, no matter how you put it together, it don't work. - What do you mean? - Only people ever did any killing for Pere was his brothers. He kept it in the family that way. Gene was already a day cold. Both Pere and Little Mikey were right here in this building answering questions when your friend got killed. So even if we leave out all this magic doll bullshit, and even if they had a reason, which they didn't, they didn't kill your friend. Now, maybe that makes it all nice and neat in your head, but the fact is, it doesn't work. Even if we lay Gene on some unrelated psycho motherfucker, or if we chalk Little Mikey up to self defense, which is okay by everybody, it still doesn't work. So, what do you say you put on your little thinking cap. And try again. - You girl! Teesha Roy. - That's me. - Yeah, how you doing? Ya'll come with me, okay, because you're being charged with accessory to murder. - [Teesha] What? - What? - Yeah, that's right, you can just thank your little friend, Kwame. - [Teesha] Kwame? - Just move your little black ass. - [Teesha] You don't have to grab me. - [Cop] Relax, sweetheart. - You know, this is just some good cop, bad cop shit, I'm not stupid. - Honey, here we're all bad. Sit down there. Fill that out. - [Teesha] You don't scare me. - Yeah, well, that just goes to show how blonde you are. Fill it out! - So, Louis. - What? I told you, I don't know nothing about no murders. - Cut the bullshit, Louis, you've been talking in circles for a long time. I'm tired of it. Look, you ready to join Teesha? Accessory to murder? This must be what you want. (Ragdoll's demonic voice) Ooh, what the fuck? (piercing scream) - Kwame, all you have to do is tell me the truth. - Look, I've told you everything I know. (shrill ring of telephone) - How much you want to bet one of your friends decided to empty the pot? - There ain't nothing to em. (screams over the speaker) - What the fuck? Go on, go on! (agonizing screams) - Oh, my God. Oh! Come on, Teesha! - [Voiceover] Oh, my God! Oh! (Teesha cries out) - Shit! Come on, we got to get out of here. - Oh my God, what about Louis? - Louis is dead. Baby, let's go! - Get some help! Get some fucking help in here! - I don't understand this, Kwame. What are you doing? - I'm copying down this spell of protection. I think it should stop the magic. I think it should. I'm not quite sure. - The magic? - Yeah. I used this book, my Gran's book. I called up the Shadow Man is what I did. But I didn't think about the price, and I didn't think about what I was doing. - Kwame, are you telling me that some magic actually killed people? - Yeah. I used the killing magic to get revenge on Pere and his brothers for what they did to my Gran. And now the Shadow Man, he's taken a life for a life. Gem, Fagene, Louis, Little Mikey. And if it takes Big Pere, well, then, it'll take payment for that, too. - Payment? You mean me? No, Kwame, that's crazy! - Oh, baby, it ain't crazy, I seen it. And now I got to try to stop it. Baby, if I can save Big Pere, then the deal is broken. And it can't take you. So go on, baby, go on. Go on and get me the phone, okay? - What? Who are you calling? - I got to call Big Pere. - Welcome to the fort. - [Teesha] What? - Don't mind this, little girl. Come on in! Move, motherfucker, move! - [Kwame] Where is everybody? - I sent them home. Closed the place up. Didn't know what the etiquette was, whether I suppose to wear two armbands, one for each brother, or let the first one ride piggyback on the second. Like old Kwame here ain't into the black band thang. He too busy being a mean ass spell casting motherfucker. Am I right? - Yeah. Whatever you say. - Whatever I say? You the one called me, motherfucker! - Yeah, that's right. I did call you. And you better hear what I got to say to you, you fat fuck. Cause I don't give a shit about you. I called the Shadow Man on you and your brothers for what you did to my Gran. And now, the Shadow Man, he done put his killing magic into my Gran's Ragdoll. - A ragdoll? You're fucking with me, right? - Yeah, I'm just fucking with you. Only you don't think I am, on account of you still here, ain't you? - I'm listening, that's all. - Yeah. Well you listen. The Ragdoll killed Gene, and he killed Little Mikey. And he's coming after you, now, unless I can stop him. And believe me, if it was just your fat ass, I wouldn't stop him. I would sit back and cheer and watch while he cut you up like the fucking hog you are! You hear me? - I'm listening. So what, you hate my ass. What the fuck you here for, huh? What you here for? What's all that about? - You want an answer? Because for every useless piece of scumbag shit, every scumbag shit like you and your fucking dead skin brothers, that the Ragdoll takes, he takes somebody I care about. And fucking dough boy, you just ain't worth it. So I got to save your black ass instead. (Ragdoll moaning) - Kwame! I heard something. - What is it? - I don't know. - Alright. Now, if you want to live, you move your black ass. Move. Take off your shirt. - What? - [Kwame] I'm not having a conversation with you! You do what I tell you to do. If you want me to save your ass, you take off your shirt. And you better move it, because if the Ragdoll ain't here now, I guarantee you, she's coming. Teesha, remember what I told you to do, okay? You gonna cooperate, or not? - Recipe. The recipe, where is it? - I got it, I got it right here. Okay, now. You see these words? Now, I want you to read them from left to right. In order, okay? And um, kind of say them under your breath. - Under my breath, okay. - Now you, you stand where you are. I'm gonna mark you in. Um Balla. To save these legs. (creepy music) (utters magic words) - Alright. Shit, okay. Balla, save his arms. Oh, Balla, save his head. - Oh, Balla. Kwame? - Come on baby, just hurry up with that stuff, okay? - I'm hurrying. - Un Balla, save his heart. - You got some chant for my dick? - Just shut the fuck up and let me do this shit, will you? - Shit! We don't have any cayenne pepper! - What? - We need cayenne pepper. - I thought you got it from the house. - I thought you got it. - Over there, over there on the shelf, yo, over there on the shelf by the refrigerator. (hurried footsteps) - Where is it? - Over there, girl, on the shelf by the refrigerator, can't you see this boy putting rigry on me? You fuck something up and no telling what's going to happen to poor old Pere. - Oh, yeah. Poor fucking Pere. (Ragdoll's demonic voice) (Ragdoll shrieking) (Teesha's bloodcurdling screams) Shit, fuck! Teesha! (thud) - Hey, boy! - Teesha! (rattling) Shit! Teesha, hold on! - Hey, boy! - Look, you just stay right there. Stay right there! - Teesha, Teesha! (knocking) Shit! - Hey, hey, boy? What's going on over there, boy? Huh? - I said stay in the circle! - Teesha, fuck! - Hey, boy! Hey, boy, I'm talking to you. What's up over there? - [Ragdolll] Eh, eh. - No, no, no, Ragdoll, you don't want to fuck with Big Pere, no, no, no. See, I got this sawed off shotgun, and I'll blow your little ass away. No, you don't want to fuck with me, see. You don't want to fuck with me. No! Ah, shit! (terrified screams) - Shit! - Kwame! I saw it, I saw it, I saw it. - Let's go! Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on, put the stuff in the bag. - Where's Pere? - I don't know, I don't know. - It's going to kill me next, isn't it? Just like it did with Gem and Louis, isn't it? - I don't know baby. Now come on, and help me get this stuff in here. - Why? It didn't do Pere no good. Bye. - Baby, I am so terribly sorry. I understand that this is all my fault, and I fucked up big time. But I want you to listen to me now, okay? I want you to listen to me, and have just a little bit of faith in me. Because I'm either gonna save your life, you hear me? I'm either gonna save your life, or I'm gonna die trying. So, please, help me. Come on, come on. Shit, come on, come on! Come on! - Ah, ah. (Teesha screams) - Let's get! - [Voiceover] Talk to me, Ella. - Oh, Lord, no. No. - Mama dia, mama dia, protect her. - What time is it? - I don't know, it's, I think it's almost morning. Come on, give me a hand. - What do you think? You think if it don't come by morning, maybe, maybe, maybe it just won't come? - No, baby, it's not no vampire. Give me your other hand. Okay. (says mystical words) Okay, now turn around. (rattling and squeaking) - Did you hear something? - Oh, yeah. She's coming! The Ragdoll's coming. Okay, come on. Turn back around. Alright. (recites magic words) - Hurry. - I'm hurrying. I'm going as fast as I can. - I'm scared. - It's okay. Shh, just be quiet. I got to concentrate, I got to concentrate. (clunk) - No, boy. Them marks won't do no good! - Gran? - They can't protect no promised thing. - Promised? - Nothing promised to the Shadow Man. What were the exact words you said to him? The exact words, boy. - I said, I said he could have whatever he wanted. - Oh, Kwame. You must've been crazy! - I said, I said he could have whatever he wanted, but he couldn't hurt you. If anything else happened to you, that the deal was off. That's what I said. - God help you, Kwame. What you did. - I know. Gran, I know. I did wrong. But, look, I will pay. I will pay, but first, Gran, I just want to save Teesha. Please. - Ain't so easy. You just about promised him the whole world. Even my poor mama made a better deal with the Shadow Man than that. She only ended up dead herself. So all them marks and words for protecting, they ain't gonna do no good. - You mean the Ragdoll's gonna come? - Ragdoll's gonna come. Shadow Man's done his side of the bargain, now he wants to get paid. Kwame promised him whatever he wanted. He wants you, because Kwame loves you. And the Shadow Man means to collect. Dang fool! Nobody ever made a deal with the Shadow Man and come out ahead. That's why nobody with sense ever deals with him. - I didn't know, Gran. I didn't know! - Hush now. You were always two thirds of a damned fool. Boy, don't make me wonder about the last third. You want old Gran to save your girl. - Can you? - Maybe. Just maybe. But if'n you want me to, you got to make Gran a promise. - What? I'll promise anything. - That's it. That's the promise I want. - What? - You don't bargain, and you don't ask what's to be done. You simply say the words. I will give anything for Teesha to be saved. Say it! - I will give anything for Teesha to be saved. - You, too, girl. Trust me, girl, just trust me and say it. Swear! - I swear. - I don't know if even that'll be enough. Come on girl, help me to my room. - No! I'll go. - No, boy, you stay here. We'll come and fetch you later. Girl, come on. I believe that love can save you. Even from the Shadow Man, if the love is strong enough. Come on, girl. (swishing) Now, listen, girl. What we got to do is gonna be hard. Hard for me, and hard for you. You must believe that the powerful good in this world is much stronger than any evil, and you must believe in me because what we have to do is gonna take all the power in my blood. And all the faith in your heart. - I believe. - Give me your hand. Hold up your hand. (uttering magic words) (sizzling) - What is this, Teesha? - This has to be done. Just sit still. - Go on girl, go on up to the top of the stairs, and do as I ask. - Teesha, where you going? - No questions, you promised. - Where you going, baby? Come on. - Look, just remember that I love you. I love you with all my heart. - Teesha. - [Teesha] I got to go. - Teesha! - By the salt of the sea, and the blood of the earth, you cannot pass. - Gran, Gran, why'd you tie me up? - By the salt of the sea, and the blood of the earth, you cannot pass. - Gran, untie me, please! - By the life of the seed, and the strength of the tree, you cannot pass. - By the life of the seed, and the strength of the tree, you cannot pass. - Gran, please, untie me! (Ragdoll makes demonic sounds) Gran, Gran! It's the Ragdoll, please untie me, fast as you can and let me do something! - I can't. - What? Why not? - I promised. - Come on, Gran, please! - By the force of the heart, and the strength of the bone, you cannot pass! (Ragdoll pants and hisses) (thud) - You did it, Gran. The Ragdoll's gone! You did it. - No, boy. Shadow Man don't give up that easy. - By the force of the bone, and the strength of the heart, you cannot pass. (demonic sounds of Ragdoll) (Teesha screams) Oh, my God, it's coming! It's coming! - Teesha! - She's coming, she's up here! - Teesha! Come on Gran, untie me! Please! Come on, Gran, let me loose. I've got to help her, please. Let me loose! - Goddammit, Kwame, shut the fuck up! (Ragdoll shrieks) (Teesha cries out) (rustling and clattering) (thud) - [Kwame] Teesha, Teesha! Teesha, Teesha! - [Teesha] No, I'm here. I'm here. - Teesha, Gran. - [Teesha] I'm sorry. - [Kwame] Gran, - [Teesha] She made me promise. - [Kwame] Come on, untie me. Untie me, untie me. - No! - [Kwame] Oh, God! Gran! Hey, Gran. Oh, my God, Gran. Oh my God. - I had to make you swear. I had to break the Shadow Man's bargain. I had to make it kill me, I knew you wouldn't agree to the price, Kwame. I had to trick you. But you see, I was right after all. Love can stand even against the Shadow Man. - I'm sorry, Gran. I'm so sorry. - I love you, Kwame. - I love you, Gran. (Gran gasps) Gran, Gran, Gran? No, no, Gran. Gran. Oh.
