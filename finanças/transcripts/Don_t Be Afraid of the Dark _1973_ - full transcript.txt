Do you think she'll come? Of course she will. You know she will. But when? When? Very soon, it's just a matter of time. I'm waiting for a while. All we have to do is bide our time. Bide our time. But it's been so long. So many years. When will she come and set us free? Set us free. Patience, please. Patience. We have all the time in the world. All the time in the world. In the world. In the world. TO set us free in the world. There's gonna be a lot of work. I'll manage. Alex, you're sure you don't mind? - About moving in here? - Yes. Well, uh, an apartment in a high-rise would've been nice but this'll be fine. You'll see, you'll like it. And anyway, it'll be fun. Yeah, you better get someone to help you. - A decorator? - And a carpenter. How about that old man, uh.. The one who used to work here? All right. The kitchen has to be completely redone. And I'm gonna need some bookcases. Alex, I wish I could find the key to that door. Hmm, must be around somewhere. I'll have another look. You know, this is really a terrific house. Um, just a little more to the left. - Oh, that's perfect. - All right. Oh, the room is beautiful. I love it. Yes, I think it'll be nice when it's finished. Even Alex likes it. I'm glad. Husbands can often be so difficult. I had to practically twist his arm for us to move in here. His idea of comfort is a high-rise. Not mine. All right, bring me the things for the party. I'll bring you the sample for the bedspread. Oh, good, thank you. I can't wait to get the upstairs done. I get very depressed every time I come up here. Yes, I'm afraid, your grandmother will not be remembered for her good taste. But she will be remembered for leaving us this house. Oh, I mustn't forget the carpet samples for the stairs. I thought something, uh, navy bluish would be a good contrast with the lime green at the living room. Oh, it sounds beautiful. Uh, before you go, there's something I wanna show you. Um, it'll only take a minute, I promise. Hello, Mr. Harris, how are you? Very good, Mrs. Farmhand. The key... you found it. Yesterday. I was going through some of my grandmother's things. And it was hidden in an envelope in her desk. Watch out, there's stairs here. Grandmother's usual cherry decor, I see. No, this time it was my grandfather. I don't think this room has been used since he died. Oh, you can't. I've tried. But, uh, it's been nailed shut for some reason. Obviously, he didn't want to be disturbed by daylight when he worked. What a nice desk. The chair's not bad. As a matter of fact, the whole room's not bad at all. I thought of making it into, um.. Some sort of office for myself. Well, why not? We could open up the shutters.. Pick all the paneling a lighter color and.. And break the fireplace. Why would anyone like to close up a lovely fireplace like that? I don't know. But I've always dreamed of having a room like this. Some place where I could sit in front of a roaring fire. Do something very romantic, like make out my grocery list. Now, I really must run along. Well, I'll see you the day after tomorrow, right? Right, I'll bring all the party things. Thank you. I'm gonna wait down here for a while, all right? All right, I'll find my own way up. - Goodbye. - Yeah, goodbye. It won't work. Sorry, miss. I didn't mean to make you jump. It's all right. Well, why won't it work? I mean, surely all it needs is to be... smashed open. Those bricks are cemented four deep and reinforced with iron bars. There's no way of opening it up. Now, whose idea was that? Your grandmother had me do that 20 years ago. Why? You know, it.. It was after, uh.. After what? I just can't open it up. Now, Mr. Harris, surely you're not afraid of a little hard work, hmm? It's not the work. It's just that some things are better left as they are. Especially that fireplace. What's this? It's, uh, for cleaning out the ashes. It's been bolted shut. By me, and that's the way it should stay. But why? It's a perfectly good fireplace. Why all the mystery? Unless you know something that I don't know. Sally? Down here in the study. All I know, miss, is what I told you before. It's just that some things are better left as they are. Hi, babe. Mr. Harris, the bookcases look great. Well, thank you. Hey, what are you all doin' down here? Uh-oh, what's the matter? Well, Mr. Harris and I aren't seeing eye-to-eye. - About what? - About the fireplace. I wanna open it up, and he wants me to leave it alone. I agree with him. It beats me why you want to use this room, anyway. It's-it's-it's damp, it's cold, it's.. This, uh, it's a miserable room. Mr. Harris doesn't think it's the cold and damp. He thinks it's the ghostly aura of my ancestors. That's not what I said, Mrs. Farmhand. That's what you implied. And he may be right. I'm gonna go upstairs and fix myself a drink. Mr. Harris, can I get one for you? No, thank you, sir, I gotta be getting along. All right. Sal? Whatever you're having is fine. Okay. Goodnight, Mrs. Farmhand. Goodnight, Mr. Harris. I'll be back tomorrow to paint the bookcases. Well, Mr. Harris, if you won't do it, I will. Okay, Sally.. Hey, what're you doin'? I just wanted to look around. You know, you're more stubborn than I am, do you know that? You really are. Can you see anything? No, nothing. It's just a ton of bricks and, uh.. Cement and iron bars closing up the opening. Yeah, well.. Sal, by the time we knock this down, ripped it out, clean it up did all that, it'd cost a fortune. Cheers. Cheers. See things my way? - I guess, I'll have to. - Okay. How about some dinner? Sally, Sally, Sally. Sally, Sally, Sally. Free, free, she set us free. We're free. She set us free. Free, free, free. Would you like some more? No, no, thanks. Sally, what are you gonna serve at the party? Well, I'm meeting Joan tomorrow at the caterers and I thought something fairly simple. Yeah, but not, not too simple. You know, I gotta make a good impression on that guy Henderson. Not to mention Roberts and Miller. Yeah. Henderson, Roberts, Miller.. And Farmhand, maybe. There's no maybe about it. Hope you're right. I think I'm right. They'd be crazy not to make you a partner. The only thing is, I wish this house was finished. I really wish this house was finished. Alex, please don't worry about it. It'll be like having a party in a subway. It'll be fun, I promise. Okay, I guess so. I guess so. Anyway, if the house isn't perfect, I'll be a perfect hostess. Sal. Yes? You do want this for me, don't you? I mean, this partnership. Well, of course, I do. It's everything you want. Everything you've worked hard for. It's just that it's.. It's what? All-consuming. I wish you had a little more time and energy. Sal, after the party.. And when I get back from San Francisco, I promise I will have. San Francisco? - Yeah, didn't I tell you about it? - No. Well, the morning after the party, Henderson and I are gonna fly up there. Why? Who is it this time? It's the Randolph Trust Company. Now, old man Randolph is one of the firm's largest accounts. Now, if I get this promotion.. I'll be handling all the business. All of it. Hey. Don't be so grim. You just married me 'cause I'm the perfect hostess. No. No, hey. I married you because I love you. I'll be upstairs. I think we have visitors. - Visitors? - Mice. I thought I saw something in the kitchen. Well, it could be, but I kind of doubt it. Remember we had the place fumigated just before we moved in. - Sal, I'm gonna take a shower. - Okay. Sally. Sally. Sally. - Alex? - Yeah? The ashtray, in the bedroom. It-it fell off the bedside table. What's the matter? I don't know, I dozed off and I suddenly woke up and.. I saw the ashtray toppling to the floor and it smashed. Well, when you woke up, you probably knocked it with your arm or something. Alex, I wasn't anywhere near it. Alex, I saw it. Like you saw the mice? Hey, you've been very, very nervous tonight. Come on. Now, let's go to bed. Sally. Sally. Sally. Well it, it suddenly spun around fell off the bedside table on to the floor. Did it smash? To smithereens. You probably knocked it off with your elbow when you sat up. That's what Alex said. But I wasn't anywhere near that ashtray. I don't know, maybe we do have mice. Mice? Last night when I was in the kitchen, I thought I heard something behind the trash can. Don't, I don't wanna hear about it. I don't care what women's lib tells me. The very mention of a mouse drives me crazy. Well, the upshot of this whole thing is I hardly slept a wink last night. What does Alex say about that? Well, he says my imagination's working overtime. And not forget the hors d'Oeuvres for the party. Which we mustn't. Oh, by the way, I made a list of some extra things you might need for the party. Oh, good, thanks. - Sal? - Yes? Sit down. I know this is none of my business but.. Is everything all right? You mean, between Alex and me? Yes. It's-it's fine. It's just that... What? Alex is at a stage in his life where all he thinks about is his job and getting ahead. What really scares me is it may not be a stage. Maybe it's permanent. You think so? I don't know. It's just the, uh.. The possibility of a partnership that's terribly important to him, that's all he thinks about. Well, isn't that understandable? It's just most of the time I feel like a reasonable adjunct to his getting ahead. Join the club. What does that mean? You forget who I'm married to? George Kahn, better known in the plastics business as Genghis Kahn. - You're kidding. George? - Dear old quiet George. I'm afraid I know rather well what it's like to be left by yourself to brood. Also, I'm very good at making emotional mountains out of imaginary molehills. Then you think last night was imaginary? - You want me to be honest? - Yes, go ahead. I think that's exactly what it was. So, as two neglected wives of two overly ambitious husbands, I suggest we go spend some of their money. All right. First we'll get the stuff for the party. Then we'll storm the department stores. All right, let's stop off in the china shop. What for? For one ashtray. As smashed by the powers of imagination. Terrific. Mr. Harris? Well, what brings you back to our favorite room? I finished the living room bookcases and figured I'd bring my paint cans and brushes down here out of the way. You shouldn't have opened it up, Mrs. Farmhand. Well, I guess my curiosity got.. The better of me. In future, you'd be better off leaving it alone. Mr. Harris, you're as bad as I am. Letting your imagination run away with you. Why has... something happened? No, what would happen? Anyway, you're quite right about the fireplace. My husband and I, both looked at it and it would be impossible to open it up. That's what I told you, but you wouldn't listen. Mr. Harris, I'm a perfect woman. Stubborn and curious. Would you like a cup of coffee? No, thank you, Mrs. Farmhand. I gotta be getting along. Thank you. We want you, Sally. We want you. We want you. We want you. We want you. Is Mr. Farmhand there? Left? When? No, no. Thank you. Alex? Alex? Alex, I know it sounds crazy, but it was something like this little ferocious animal grabbed at my dress. I heard all these little voices. Look, Sally, you gotta stop this. Alex.. They were calling my name. They kept saying over and over again, "We want you. We want you." Sally, stop it! Obviously it's Harris' idea of some kind of a crude practical joke. - Where's the key? - It's in the lock. - That's where it was yesterday. - Well, it's not there now. I've had enough of this. Mr. Harris. Yes, Mr. Farmhand. Look, I don't know what's going on around here but my wife is very, very badly upset. No, listen, hold on. To begin with, you tell her all those scary stories about the study. And then there's the business about the ash door. Now, first, you bolt it up and then for no apparent.. Don't interrupt me. And then, for no apparent reason you.. You take the bolts out again. No, no, no. No. We haven't touched them, either. We haven't touched the bolts. And I know it didn't get unbolted by itself. Now, wait! I got something to say to you. There's a little matter of a key missing. Now, you've got no excuse in the world for taking the key out of that door. There's every... what? What did he say? He said that after he put the bolts back in the ash door and came upstairs with you, he never touched them again. He doesn't know anything about the key, either. He also said we could find ourselves a new carpenter. Why? He was embarrassed, obviously, and he feels guilty. Well, I can't say that I'm sorry. He's a very good worker. It's just that dictatorial attitude of his. I don't think he did anything. Well, who did? I don't know. That's what scares me. Look, Sal, I know you're under a lot of pressure. The next couple of days are very important. We got that dinner party tomorrow night and I'm depending on you. - I know. - And this is absurd, anyway. All these... these little creatures running around, calling your name and grabbing a hold of your dress. But after the party, you'll be gone. Yeah. Yeah I'll be gone... two days but only one night. I put your ice in the freezer so it wouldn't melt. And your punch bowl's there on the table. Oh.. Thanks, Ethyl. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry I scared you. No, no, it's all right. You're trembling. You a little nervous about the party? Yes, I guess I am. Are you sure you're all right? Yes, I'm... really I'm fine. Well, in spite of being nervous, you look terrific. Thanks. Okay, hold it again. Right there. - Good! - George, please, not now. All right, later, then. Sally! How are you? Hello, Sally. Hi. You look wonderful. Vacation. A month in Mexico. Oh, I envy you. Listen, go right on in. I think you know everybody. I think so. Hi, Sally. Great party. - Thank you. - Hi, Sally. The house is marvelous. I'm glad you like it. - Hors d'oeuvre, Mrs. Farmhand? - No, Ethyl, I-I don't think so. Ethyl, thank you for coming tonight and helping out. That's all right, this way I can make sure the catering people clean up and don't leave a mess for me in the morning. Sally, darling, the house is divine. - Who did it? - Francisco Perez. And he did the flowers and the candles, too? Yes, he said if we kept it dark enough, no one would notice that the house was half finished. I think I could really use him. - Mrs. Farmhand? - Oh, no, thank you. Um, I think I'll have some of this punch. I think the Randolph Trust people will be pushovers, really. Yeah, could be. Hi, Sally. Nice party. Thank you. Well, tomorrow is a big day. So I hear, San Francisco. There's not a thing to worry about. Alex will come through with flying colors. I know he will. How does it feel to be the wife of a man with a great future? Just great. Um, will you excuse me? I have to, um, check on the dinner. Sally, hold again for another one, please? - George. - Thank you. The last thing anyone needs right now is to be blinded by a flash bulb. Now, would you please get me another drink? All right. How are you feeling? Oh, I'm bearing up. Dinner is served, Mrs. Farmhand. Thank you, Ethyl. Dinner's ready, everyone. Your names are on those little cards. Oh, Sally. Hey, I understand you spent a month in Mexico. Don't remind me. Really? Expensive, huh? Alex has been telling me about the house. I think you've done a great job. We're still in the middle of it. Oh, here. Let me. Oh, thank you. Yes, it's been quite a hassle. We had to sleep in one of the spare rooms and the dining room isn't finished yet. Alex! Alex! Alex, please, Alex. There was nothing there. Nothing! I saw it. There were at least 10 other people around you, including your friend Joan, and they didn't see anything. Maybe you oughta see some kind of a doctor. Do you think I'm making this up? God only knows. For some reason, you suddenly don't seem to like it around here. You want out. What does that mean? I mean, it suddenly seems to me that you don't like this house.. Now, I wanna ask you something. Is this some roundabout way of your telling me that you want me to sell this house? Of course not. I love this place, you know that. Then, what is it? I told you before. There's something going on here. Oh, girl, I'm gonna take you by the hand inch by inch around this house and show you there's nothing to be afraid of. Lousy attitude to take. Oh, is it? Is it? You gonna be long? No, it's all yours. Hey, don't hurt her. - Not yet. - But I want to. - I want to. - No. No. - Why? - He'll hear... in the bedroom. But I want to. But I want to get her. No. Wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow, we'll get her. - All of us. - Then we just scare her, eh? Yes, scare her. Cut her. All right then, scare her. Scare her! Maybe you oughta see some kind of a doctor. And this is absurd anyway. All these, these little creatures running around. All I know, miss, is what I told you before. Some things are better left as they are. Alex, I think you're right about this house. I think we should sell it. - You mean that? - Yes, I do. I really do. No matter how much we.. We paint it or fix it up.. There's something very depressing about it and.. Well, after a while, it just seems to get to you. Oh. Sally. Hey, if you really feel that way.. We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it when I get back from San Francisco, all right? Thank you. I mean, we've lived in apartments before, we can do it again. Thank you for understanding. You're welcome. I think I'll read for a while. - I'm gonna sleep now. - Sleep well. You too. I won't wake you in the morning. I'll let you sleep. Goodnight. Just a few more days and I'll be safe. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow we'll get her. - Get her. - Get her tomorrow. - Tomorrow we'll get her. - Yeah, we'll get her tomorrow. Hi, Mr. Harris. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. How are you? I just came by to pick up my tools. Oh, I think they're downstairs in the study where you left 'em. - Oh, thank you. - Uh, Mr. Harris. - Yeah? - Uh.. I think I owe you an apology. I was kinda rude and angry on the phone the other day. - Yeah, I reckon we both were. - All right. Fair enough. Hey, could I buy you a cup of coffee? - Maybe a quick one, then. - Good. Mr. Harris, I was wondering if you'd reconsider. By that, I mean coming back here to work. There still are some things I'd like to get done. I don't think it'd be a good idea, Mr. Farmhand. Why? Why, 'cause we had a beef? No, no. That's all over with and forgotten. Well, then, why? Sir, I have my way of looking at things and you and your wife have yours. And it's like I said before, I think there are some things that shouldn't be taken lightly. About this house? Why don't we stop all that nonsense? - I don't call it nonsense! - All right, superstition. And I don't call it superstition, either! Well, then, what do you call it? I don't have a name for it, but I wouldn't call it either one of those things. Look, Mr. Harris... I don't wanna get in another beef with you, and I don't mean to offend you, sir.. But I don't happen to believe in all that stuff! I know you don't, but it might be better for you and Mrs. Farmhand if you did. Well, that's where you're wrong.. Because she's quite frightened enough already as it is. And I've gotta hold you partly responsible for that. I only warned her. Yeah, to the extent that she wants to sell this place. - Sell it? - That's right. We're movin'. I'd appreciate it if you'd give me couple of weeks' work. You know, it needs fixin' up. I'm afraid not, sir, and I'm sorry if I... - You told him. - Shit. - You told. - You told him. - Why did you tell? - I tell you, I didn't. - You told him. - I didn't tell. I didn't. I-I, I didn't say anything. - I didn't tell him anything! - Why did you tell? And you know what happens to people who tell, don't you? But I didn't. I didn't tell. I, I just warned him. That's all. - Yeah, but you don't. - Ah! Come on! Open the door! - Open the door. - What's the matter? The wind must have blown the door shut. I, I couldn't get it open. What happened to you wrist? Oh, that, the light wasn't working and I was trying to find my flashlight to get something to open the door with. I must have jabbed myself with one of the tools. - You gonna be all right? - Yeah. Everything is all right. Who was that? It was Harris. He forgot his tool box. Oh, yes, I forgot. He still angry with us? Well, with him it's hard to tell. Hey, are you all right? Yes, I think so. Hey, why don't you call Joan and ask her to come over and spend the night with you? - I think I will. - Okay. - Alex? - What? Oh, nothing. - Just come back soon. - I will. I will. You take care of yourself. Stop being so scared. Yes, I feel much better. Really. Yes, he left about an hour ago. Um, Joan, I wondered if you could come over here later? I really don't wanna stay in this house alone tonight. Stay with you? Oh, yes. That's a much better idea. I didn't wanna ask. Are you sure it's all right? Okay. Could you pick me up around 4 o'clock? All right. Thanks, Joan. - Good morning, Ethyl. - Good morning. I hope there wasn't too much of a mess after the party. Mostly glasses, the catering people took care of the rest. Did you notice if there were any candles left? Uh, no. No, they took that away with the rest of it. Do we have any? Well, uh, just those birthday ones. Oh, I'm afraid those won't be enough. Um, I'm going upstairs to get dressed and I'm gonna go out for a while. All right. Is that Mr. Perez's station wagon outside? He's upstairs now. He came with the samples for the bedroom curtains, finally, and some bits of carpet. Was it all right to let him in? Oh, sure. I guess I'll have to go up and talk to him. We won't be needing the curtains or Mr. Perez, I'm afraid. Why's that? Well, my husband and I have decided to move out. We, uh, really don't like this house and.. We're going to sell it. Oh, my, after all the work you've done here, that's a pity. But, uh, I can't say I blame you. I never did like these old places myself. Well, Ethyl, I, I hope you'll continue to be with us, wherever we are. Well, well, I-I-I hope so, too. I'll call you, Ethyl, and let you know what our plans are. All right. Goodbye, Mrs. Farmhand. - Goodbye. - Thank you. That's the most incredible I've heard in my life. Of course you have to pay. I spent hours on this job. Hours. Wallpapers. Paintings. Besides that, it was all that work I did for your party. Oh! Who are you? - What do you want? - We want you, Sally. He was a mistake. It's your spirit we need. Your spirit we want. - Your spirit. Your spirit. - Why me? Your spirit. You set us free. Whoever frees us must become one of us and live with us. Live with us. Ma'am, if there's anything else we need, we'll be in touch. Thank you for getting here so quickly. Thanks for you cooperation. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - How is she? - Ah, she's a little calmer. I tried to get her to lie down, but she, uh, she refused. - I'll leave these with you. - What are they? Sleeping pills. Try to get her to take one, if you can. I don't think she will. Tell me something.. You've know her for some time now, haven't you? Couple of years. Does she tend to be over-imaginative? No. I've always thought her as rather level-headed. Well, I've realized this has been a severe shock to her, but she does seem to have over-reacted. I know. Well, if you can, get her to take one of those and.. Try to get her to bed. I'll try. Thank you, doctor. What are you doing? I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - I don't know. A hotel, anywhere. I just want to get out of this house. Why don't you wait until Alex gets here, then you can come to my house? - No, I want to leave now. - Well, that's silly. Alex said he was catching the 4 o'clock plane. He's probably on his way from the airport now. I don't care. I just don't want to stay in this house any longer. Listen, I made you some coffee. Do you want it? No, thank you. Well, you better put these in your suitcase. - What are they? - Sleeping pills. The doctor asked me to give them to you. I don't, I don't want them. Well, I'll put them here in case you do. I told you, I don't want them. Sal? I'm sorry. You're exhausted. Why don't you lie down, try and relax, and wait for Alex? - I can't. - He'll be here any minute. - They killed him. - Who? What are you talking about? Francisco Perez. They tripped him with a little piece of cord. Who did? He didn't really.. Fall down the stairs. He tripped him with a little piece of cord when he came by the passageway. Sally, don't do this. You'll only upset yourself again. I was right behind him. I-I saw the cord and I grabbed it. I pulled on it. But they kept saying, "It's you we really want." Sally, please, don't. I held onto it, but I couldn't. Look. How did you do that? They did it with the cord. You've got to believe me. I think I do. But I... doubt if anyone else will. I thought it was Alex. Drink this coffee. Be right back. - I'm glad you're back. - How is she? Oh, hysterical, but she's better now. - Alex, I gotta talk to you. - Not now! There's something going on in this house. Sally says there's something trying to kill her. Whatever it was killed Perez and is still trying to get her. That's nonsense. You don't believe that, do you? - Yes, I do. - Have you both gone mad? - What's going on around here? - Alex. Sally? Sally? Sally? Sally? Alex. Alex, please get me out of here. Sally, what's going on? What's going on, Sal, what happened? I don't know. Alex, they're t-trying to kill me. Alex, I'm so tired. Please help me get out of here. Then I can be safe. Joan, what did the doctor give her? Nothing. At least, she didn't take anything. She didn't take anything. What's this? Sleeping pills. The doctor left them. - Were they open? - Yeah. How many were there? I think there were six. There are only four left. She obviously changed her mind then, didn't she? Or something changed it for her. Oh, Joan. Alex. Sal? Sal? What's this? Look at the other one. Joan.. You better tell me what's going on. - Come outside. - All right. Alex? Alex, don't-don't turn off the light. All right. What happened to her hands? All I know is what Sally told me. She says that Perez tripped on the stairs, and that something ripped the cord out of her hands when she held on to it. - Joan, I really... - Listen, Alex. I think you've got a choice. Either you accept the fact that something is going on in this house. That some supernatural element is trying to harm Sally. Or you say that she's having a mental breakdown and that she's just imagining everything. Are you implying that I'm trying to duck the truth? Are you? No, I'm trying to find out what it is. Well, I don't think you're gonna find it by insisting that we're all crazy. I'm sorry. What about that carpenter? Harris? Sally said he told both of you that there was something wrong with this house. - Yes, he did. - What exactly did he say? Nothing much. Well, he gave me a warning. He said, "Don't laugh at things you don't understand." That kind of a routine. Alex, for Sally's sake, I think you oughta talk to him. Oh, no. Please? All right, all right. I'll call him. See if he's home. It's all right, it's only me. Where's Alex? Don't worry, he's downstairs. We've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. Alex will take of everything. Just, just try to relax and rest for a while. All right? Yes, I... but a lot's happened since then, Mr. Harris, and I gotta find out what's going on. Yes. Yes, I'll make it in ten minutes. I'll be over there, yes. What did he say? He'll see me. Look, here's the number in case you need me. - Joan, you look awful beat. - I'm okay. I'm going to make myself a cup of coffee. Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can. Don't worry. I'll take good care of her. - Joan? - It's okay, I'm here. Where's Alex? He'll be back soon. - I wanna get up. - Hey. What happened? Must be the wind. Must've torn down a cable. All I can tell you, Mr. Farmhand, is what I pieced together myself over the years. You mean, since Sally's grandparents lived in the house. That's right. He, Mr. Bennett, that is, and his wife bought the house when he retired. Seems like he was somewhat of an amateur carpenter. Guess you might call him one of the original. "Do it yourselfers." And, just like your wife, he wanted to use that downstairs room as a study. It was him who opened up the fireplace. Then the place was already bricked up when they bought it? That's right. And the ash door was bolted up, too. From what I've heard since, that fireplace hadn't been used since the house was built, back in the the 1880's. We need some fuses. Could have overloaded the circuits. I turned on every light in the house. I'll go down and look. No, Joan, you, you can't go down there. Joan, don't. Sally, just keep the candles burning. Everything will be all right. Where's the fuse box? It's... it's outside by the back door. And the spare fuses? I guess Alex keeps them in the box. Alex is at this number. Come up. I want you to call him there now, and keep talking to him.. Until I get back, do you understand? I'll be back in a minute. Mr. Bennett.. When he opened that fireplace.. What happened to him? What happened to him? Hello? Hello? Hello, is Alex there? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? I think it was your wife. She was asking for you, but she hung up. Sally, I'm locked out! Sally. Sally. Sally. All I know is what one of the maids told me. She said that one evening, Mr. Bennett went down to that room to do some work. Now, he hadn't been in there more than half an hour. Then his wife upstairs heard cries and terrible screams. - Sally. - Sally. - Sally. - Sally. Come, Sally. Sally. Sally. Sally. Well, she and the servants ran down the stairs. The door was locked, but they broke it down. Everything in that room was wrecked. Are you telling me.. That something reached up through that fireplace and pulled that old man down through the hole? That's all I can tell you, Mr. Farmhand. And I think.. That's where he is now. We've been waiting for you, Sally. Sally. We're waiting. Sally. Sally, we want you. Sally. Sally. Come along. Sally, help me! Help me, I can't get in! - Sally. - Sally. Sally, we're waiting for you. Sally. - Sally. - Sally. Sally. Come to us. - Sally. - We're waiting. - Sally. - Sally. - Sally. - Come to us. Sally? Sally, can you hear me? Sally, open up! Sally? Sally, let me in. I'm locked out. Sally? Can't you hear me? I'm locked out! Come, Sally. Come to us. We're waiting for you. Come to us. We need you. Sally. Sally. Come, Sally. - No, please. - We got her. - Don't.. - We got her. Help me. We got her. We got her. We got her. Don't. Alex. A-Alex, help. Thank heaven you're here. I can't get in. The door's bolted from inside. Sal. Sally! Sally! Will anyone come? Do you think they'll come? Will anyone come and set us free? Of course they will come. We know they will. But when? When? When? Soon. Very soon. We have lots of time. Lots of time. All the time in the world. - Time. - Time. Time to set us free again. All the time in the world. - To set us free. - TO set us free. TO set us free on the world. - Free.. - Free On the world. - Free.. - Free On the world. Set us free.
