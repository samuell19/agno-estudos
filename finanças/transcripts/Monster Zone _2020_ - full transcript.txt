Professor Juan. Professor Juan! PROFESSOR JUAN! Sorry, I couldn't hear you over my crunching. It's alright. I'm going to pickup some food. My treat. You want the same as last night? No, I'm not that hungry. Just bring me some tacos and two extra large enchiladas, and a chimichanga (tortilla), and a few tostadas (deep fried tortilla). No problem. And, ah, keep an eye on the atomic particle reactor while I'm gone. Everything is safe with me. Oh, oh, and ... I know, I know. Don't forget the salsa. CRANSTON ACADEMY MONSTER ZONE GREENWOOD SCHOOL SCIENCE BATTLE Welcome to the Greenwood Public School Science Battle. PHOTOSYNTHESIS Photosynthesis? Ho, that's so boring. Next. FLUSHING WHERE DID IT ALL GO??? Next, THE SCIENCE OF SNOT Next, Get back here, Otto. Sit. Stay. Stop. Watch where you going, Einstein. You know calling someone Einstein is a compliment. Two for flinch-en. Up next is Danny Dawkins and ... Where is your partner? No partner. I,m a solo operator. That cause he has no friends. They said the best inventions come from solving a problem, right? I suppose. Well, Otto has fleas and he hates being shampooed. So I invented a nano bot. To go in and deal with them face to face. Have a look through the microscope. You can see my bot in action. I don't see what the big deal is. That's because it's a Small deal. It's a nano bot. It uses liquid nitrogen to freeze the fleas... Next time try to make your project more visual. Nice one, loser. What do we have here? A volcano? Volcano. Now that was entertaining. I think we have our Science Battle winner. Volcano. Great work, sweety. Thank you, mom. I thought this prize was for the best scientist. And not for the most obnoxious momma's boy. What did you say about my mom? Get him. Shh... Come on Danny. You can't hide from us. You know the rules. If you run away, it only makes it worse. No. They won't be bothering you anymore. Wow. That thing is incredible. Course it is. I invented it. My name is Miss Evans. I am the principle of Cranston Academy. A secret boarding school for geniuses. I have a private matter to discus with you. It doesn't get more private than this. We've following your academic progress for years. And think that you would be better appreciated elsewhere. You think? We would like to offer you a full scholarship to Cranston. Welcome to Cranston Academy. At my old school. They said that learning wasn't rocket science. But at Cranston it is. Cranston will help you unlock your full potential. You can let your imagination run wild. With everything you need to success right at your finger tips. Come to Cranston and you could be the next Edward Fizzerton. We want you to come to Cranston. Under our guidance, I think you could do great things. So I have to decide between staying at my current school, where I'm majoring in "Trying not to get flushed down the toilet", or take a full scholarship to a place with the word "genius" in it's name? I'll understand if you need some time to think it over... I'm in. We'll send a car. Don't forget to wash your hands. Now when she says "full scholarship", does that include this car service? Because it seams pretty fancy. Mom, it's fine, it's taken care of. Remember what we talked about. I don't wanna get a call from this new school tell us that you reanimate all dissected frogs or developed some sort of experimental chicken expanding rate. Yea, I'm sorry about that, but the effect should be temporary. Have fun at genius school, sweetheart. Tell everyone that you get your smarts from my side of the family. Goodbye Danny. Goodbye Danny. Estimated time to London, England, is approximately one hour and three minutes. What? The flying car is very impressive. These mints leave a lot to be desired. Spinning sequence, keep your seat belt fasten, until the vehicle has come to a complete stop. Welcome to the Cranston Academy. WELCOME DANNY Park car 17. Wow. Wow. It's miserable out. This is the nicest weather we've had in months. Welcome to England. Cranston is home to the top students from all over the world. You're part of an elite group, Danny. Wow. Look at this place. Wait. Hey. Please watch where you're hovering, Mr. Olinov. Sorry, Miss Evans. An atomic particle reactor? No way. The atomic particle reactor is off limits. It was damaged a long time ago. Miss Evans? Can you please sign my permission form to keep my experiment going? I think you're making great progress, Tammy Even though cloning isn't officially part of the curriculum. You hear that Tammy 2. You're getting a sister. Awesome She loves to clone. Our 3-D bio printer has been going nonstop. Oh, but reminds me, I need to order more flesh cartridges. Ew. Oh, you're going to love your teacher, Professor Stern. He is a wonderful educator. And don't let the name fool you. I think you'll find He's quite fun. IQ-Scan correct. Principal Evans. Professor Stern, class. I'd like to introduce you to Danny Dawkins. The first recipient of the new Cranston Academic Scholarship. Ah, yes, the new scholarship program. Pluck a child out of the academic gutter, and drop him into the best school on the planet. Danny, why don't you tell the class about your science fair project. I built a nanobot to freeze the fleas off my dog. But that's just the beginning. There is a lot of other applications for this tech. Good luck Danny. I'll take that. My Nano-Bot. Let's get one thing straight son. Cranston Academy is a school for geniuses. But I'm a genius too. Please, your very presence in this room is lowering the average IQ by at least 10 points. And that includes the pet hamster. Miss. Evans said she was really impressed by my science fair project. Please, Cranston students aren't even allowed to enter science fairs. This scholarship is our principal short-sighted idea, to bring in some fresh blood. But you'll fail soon enough. And we'll go back to being the great school we've always been. Now take a seat. Now class... Don't listen to Stern. He's just jealous. My name's Liz. Nice to meet someone normal. You are normal, right? I read about your bot design online. It's brilliant. Your engineering skills would really come in handy on the major class project. Want to work with me on it? Thanks for the offer, but I'm a solo operator. Scholarship boy. Stop talking. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. Thank's a lot genius. That took me two bloody weeks to build and it's due in an hour. You don't happen to have a radiation suit do you? No. That's a shame. Thanks. Can I help you? You're in my room. Actually you're in my room. We're... Roommates? Roommates? Are you kidding me? No way. This is so unfair. You think I want this? Do I look like I need some Unhygienic, never showers, can't clean up after himself, roommate? Hey, I shower. Occasionally. There has got to be a rational explanation behind this. Yes. Someone's trying to ruin my life. We'll just go to Miss Evans and tell her you need a new room. First, You're the one who needs a new room. Second, she's not gonna do anything. I'm the only student without a roommate. In that case... What is that? A hollow wall. Just a little something I invention. It lets me know if anyone wanders on to my side of the room to steal my ideas. Why would I want to do that? I don't know, Maybe because my last lab partner published a scientific paper I wrote under his name and got an R and D job at Global-Tech. Ouch. Yea. Let's just say, I don't work with partners anymore. ♪ Can't stop me. ♪ What is that? You don't know who Edward Fizzerton is? I can't believe they let you go here. He's only the guy who created the fusion reactor. Photographs the inside of a black hole. And has just announced the discovery of a new particle called the Fizz Boson. If you couldn't tell. He is my personal hero. He is my dad. Whoa, wait. Your Liz Fizzerton? Wow. It's a lot to live up to. I'm not live in his shadow if that's what you thinking. It's just a coincidence that I taking all the same courses him did. What's he like? Is he like always doing cool things? Like just being cool or whatever? No. He is my dad. By definition, that means he's uncool. Are you gonna tell him about me? Definitely not. Good night, Danny. Well, what a you know. I'm not quite ready for bed yet. And the light switch is on my side of the room, so ... Good night. Thank you for fixing it. I had to do something. Could just couldn't sleep. Was it nerves? No, it was snores. You snore so loud, it's like a chainsaw. I am so sorry to hear that. I know, it's like... I mean I'm sorry to hear that Liz is stuck with you as a roommate. And Liz, don't be ashamed. I snore too. Do to my elongated uberla. I don't snore. Pop quiz. You have three minutes to solve this equation. I'm sure you all did the required reading. That's time. I thought you didn't do the reading. How did you come up with this formula? I reverse engineered it. Let's run this through the computer marking system. TEST RESULTS DANNY 99 99! Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, that's the lowest marking in the class. At Cranston, 99 percent is failed. Thanks, Tammy 2. I'm Tammy 3. You'll need to do better then that. If your major project isn't spectacular. Your gone. Working on your major project? I'm trying to. I need to come up with something big. How about some sort of machine to recycles all those bad ideas? Very funny. Well I'm going to bed, so you'll have to close the bad idea factory til tomorrow. Nay, nay, nay... ATOMIC PARTICLE REACTOR RESTRICTED ACCESS New plan. Fix the Atomic particles reactor, discover a new particle, name it after myself and prove to everyone I'm a genius, and deserve to be here. Simple. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day. April eighth. Inventor's journal. The atomic particle reactor is in worse shape than I thought. I'm going to need high voltage batteries, an insane amount of copper wire, and an even more insane amount of chocolate. ♪ Oh, baby, are you gonna play♪ ♪ See yea kicking off ♪ ♪ Let me get to know yea. ♪ ♪ Baby don't know you at all. ♪ ♪ Tell me how know? ♪ ♪ I'm not crazy or feeble. ♪ ♪ Night, night. ♪ ♪ Light, light. ♪ ♪ Oh, yea. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ Got a feeling. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Take your time. ♪ ♪ And try not to break it. ♪ ♪ On, on, on ♪ ♪ Get, get off, ♪ ♪ and make up your own ♪ ♪ I, I, I ♪ ♪ can see that your watchen. ♪ ♪ Don't be shy ♪ ♪ I kind, kind a like it. ♪ ♪ Don't be shy ♪ ♪ I kind, kind a like it. ♪ ♪ Electrical socket. ♪ So this is where you been going every night. What are you doing here? Some nights I can't sleep. Every time I've woken up in the past two weeks you've been gone. So this time I followed you. Nice detective work. You know this atomic poetical reactor is off limits, right? You're going to been in so much trouble. If I don't do something amazing. I'm not gonna last at Cranston. So I'm fixing this thing. Professor Stern has been trying to fix this thing for years. He'll even more impressed with me. I built a new IC circuit and rewired a high powered microwave generator in to the control panel. Now stand back, I'm gonna fire it up. Don't fire anything up until I'm back in the dorm. Don't be such a baby. Nobody ever made history sitting around doing nothing. Well that was monumental. I don't get it. Your electromagnetic polarity is reversed, dummy. So far so good. That's a bit alarming. Wow. Danny? What are you doing? Checking it out. Wait. If you get into trouble in there, I can pull you out. Your such a worrier. What's going on in there? It's fine. Stop pulling the cord. Maybe it's time to go home. Okay, it is definitely time to go home. Ow. What happened? You're supposed to be tied to this chord. We've got to turn it off. Come on Come on. Come on. Why won't it shut down? Well that problem solved. Now let's get that monster. Yea. And this is what I needed. Yes, see, see. Come with me. Come to... It doesn't look dangerous. Are you serious? For a monster, I mean. Maybe we should try to talk to it. Be my guest. I'm right behind you Very far behind you. Oh. So bright. So beautiful. It's like you speak directly to my heart. The whisper from an ancient love fills me passion. Hello? -Like the warm glow... -Hello? ...from the sun. Starts a party in my eyes. Ay, ay, ay. Sorry, Mimor (My love), it's not you, it's me. Hello there. Hello, Chiquitita (pretty little girl). Ay, ay, ay. Please, no. I don't take me back, I don't take me back to the scary place. We just want to talk to you. Who are you? I'm Liz, no, no, I'm Danny. That's Liz. Hi. Who are you? Daniel, Elizabeth, maravilloso (delighted). I guess you can call me Mothman. I used to be something else, but now I'm a monstruo (monster). Where did you come from? Why are you here? What's this glowing slime? What is a monstruo (monster)? Not monstruo, monstruo (monster). Say it with me. What kind of alien language is that? You serious, Danny? It's not alien. It's Spanish. Wait a minute, that makes even less sense. Why does the moth creature speak Spanish? I will answer all of your questions , amigos (friend). But, ah, first I need something to eat. What do moths eat? Oh, I know. Liz has a bunch of really tacky sweaters. My sweaters are off limits. Do Not eat them. Sweaters sound good. But I absolutely craving for some tacos. I know just the place. Oh. I thought I lost you. You will be my baby forever TACOS EL MEXICANO (THE MEXICAN) It Looks okay. Welcome to El Taco's. May I take your order? Oh, see, yes, good evening. I would like a...a order from Tacos Al Pastor, please, with toddle, Ah, two quesadillas (tortilla) with cheese and one gringa, prefer. We only have what's on the menu, sir. Oh dios mio, que horror. (Oh my God, what a horror.) ¿Qué es esto? (What's this?) Mexican sushi? This will make my ancestors cry. Even those on the moth side of the family. We'll just go take a seat. You call this Mexican? This is an insult. Keep your voice down. If anyone sees you here. They're going to call the cops. Oh, because I'm Mexican? No, because you are a four-armed moth creature from another dimension. Ah, I see, I see. Okay. We got you some food. Now it's time to answer some questions. You better start from the beginning. Assume we know nothing. Especially her. You know, I wasn't always like this. I was an engineer at Cranston Academy. One night during a terrible rain storm. Lightning struck. And I got sucked into that scary place. So that happened when a super high voltage surge went through the atomic particle reactor? I think the place you got sucked into is... The fourth dimension. What are you talking about? The fourth dimension is time. Everyone knows that. Yes, everyone knows that. Fine. I think the place that you got sucked into is... The fifth dimension. What is this place? I never thought I would make it out alive. Believe it or not, I was quite handsome before I was a monster But in the fifth dimension. I was attacked by a giant moth. What's this? ¿Qué es eso ahora? (What is that now?) It hurts. Ayuda. (Help) Ay, ay, ay. I spent the last 20 years searching for that moth. I wanted my revenge. You talking to me? We meet again, my darling. As I knew we would. I can still feel your photons caressing my skin. Come here. It must be terrible to have me... What is he doing there? ...and then to lose me like this. This is the most amazing scientific discovery in the last hundred years. I'm, definitely getting a good mark in science class. We have to share this with the world. Easy for you to say, chica (girl). You don't have moth wings growing out of your back. We've all got stuff we wish we could change about ourselves. Like Liz and her snoring. Danny, I swear I'm going to strangle you in your sleep What's wrong? Are you okay? I'm sorry compañera (buddy). Ever since I became a monster I've had horrible headaches. The only thing that gives me relief is this. My dear Salsita. GHOST PEPPER HOT SAUCE Ghost pepper hot sauce? Ha. My own recipe. And the one good thing to come from the 5th dimension. As I scavenge for food. I discovered the hottest peppers I ever eaten. They are truly not of this earth. And you made them into hot sauce. Naturally, I am Mexican. Can I try some? Be cautious my pale friend. It is hotter than the fiery depths of hell. I can handle it. I love spicy food. We'll see. Excuse me for a moment. Good luck. So, how was it? I've had hotter. What are you doing? We have class. Who cares about Stern's stupid class? We've got to go back to the portal. Students at Cranston don't just skip class. If you're not there, they'll send out a search party. We need to play cool and act like nothing's wrong. We'll go back to the portal as soon as we can get away. Alright. Fine. Mothman, you hang out here. Make yourself at home. Oh, clean sheets What's the chance that he's regularly laundering that underwear in the fifth dimension? Act...Actually, Mothman, would you mind sleeping under the bed? Keep it low-key in case somebody comes in. I'm gonna have to burn my sheets Finely. Ah. I knew it. Do not eat my sweater. Your major project makes up 80 percent of your final grade. In many cases, it will be what defines your time here at Cranston. Who will be the first to share their proposal? Oh, why not? Mr. Dawkins? I... give a kid a chance student. For my major project I'm working with Liz. And we're going to demonstrate proof of a parallel fifth dimension. Uh, we're not sure how it's got here. I think it's kind of like what happens in a black hole. Where space time gets bent on it...it...it self, Or maybe like a wormhole or something. This is a science class , not science fiction. Elizabeth, I would advise you not to shackle yourself to someone who's going to drag you down. You've got a lot to live up to. Now, does anyone have a real proposal? I'm working on developing a wrist mounted... Delicious taquitos (small tortilla). But the simple answer to this question. Piss... is a high yield of... Liz. Ow. What are we going to do? At least he's not kissing light bulbs. Danny. Professor Stern? I need to use the bathroom. Stop interrupting. It's an emergency. I ate some bad Mexican last night. Really didn't agree with me. I'll probably be gone for a while. I also have to use the bathroom. Bad enchiladas. What are you doing? We told you to stay in the room. Oh my kids. I found a taco truck down the road that had some real Mexican food. I was so excited that I had to come find you. Okay... Here. Wow. That is really good. Liz, you gotta try this. Do you know how much trouble we've be in if someone sees you walking around out here? Oh because I'm Mexican? No. For the last time because you're a four-armed mons... Uh, of course. Because I'm a four-armed monster. Sometimes I forget. But then there they are. Well, mister, "You have to do better than this" already hates me. And now he hates you for working with me. So we might as well cut class and check out the portal. Be a help and grab the door would yea? That's not good. You know that feeling you have when things are about to get really bad? I never get that feeling. Now, quit being a Negative Nelly. I'd rather be a Negative Nelly than a Dead Nelly Uh, who is this Nelly? The portal, it's back. Whatever monster came out of there is running wild on school property. You always assume the worst. In fairness that student could be screaming about anything. Homework, acne, Final Exams In this case, you were right to assume the worst. New plan. Get the monster back in the portal. And convince that kid He's crazy. Oh man. It totally wiped itself off on that kid Come on. You didn't see nothing. Nothing. You local. Local. Local man. Shh. What are you doing? He's a student. A kid? I thought it was a monster. Kids over here are very ugly. Did you guys see that? It looks like it went right through the wall. Ladies first. Why me? You're the one who opened the portal. Technically, you fixed the last piece of the reactor. Which makes you the one who opened the portal. So after you. You suck. Hello. Gooey Pink Monster. His name is Manuel. This thing has a name? Well, that's what I named him. Huh, guys... Remember, it's probably more scared of us than we are of it. I don't know. I'm pretty scared right now. Calm down, Manuel. Run. That sounded expensive. Danny. This tastes even grosser than it looks. Danny, use this. Suck on this. Explain yourselves. I fix the atomic particle reactor and mess with space-time. I accidentally opened a portal to another dimension. And accidentally released a pink slime monster into our world. He totally destroyed our computer lab. Are you finished? Yes. No, the monster's name is Manuel. Now I'm finished. He's lying about the atomic particle reactor. I wasn't smart enough to fix it which means you certainly aren't. If there's ever been a better case for expulsion. I can't remember it. What? Something horrible is going on and I've got the feeling we're the only ones who can stop it. Get in the car. Go to the Atomic Particle Reactor and see for yourself. There is a portal to another dimension. Please Miss Evans, you have to believe us. Life only gives you so many chances, Danny. The next time someone goes out of the way for you. Try not to throw it in their face. Warning. Warning. Manuel. You idiot. You ate the principal. Miss Evans. We've gotta stop that thing. Portal was getting bigger. It's doubled in size again. That means bigger monsters can come out. How much bigger can they get? I imagined something bigger. Yes, that's more like it... Ah, Javier. You're a bad eel. I really think you need meaner sounding names for these monsters that are trying to kill us. What happened to you? We were trying to convince the teachers that the fifth dimension was real. You were our proof. Oh I'm sorry. You told me, "Hide from humans". So, I hid from humans. There's no need to hide anymore. You'll fit right in. There are monsters everywhere. Okay. IQ scan, failed. Sorry, it had to be. Oh, sorry. Sorry, so...so...sor...sorry If my calculations are correct. And that thing keeps growing at this rate. The portal will swallow everything in... 24 hours? Get them to the brain. What are you doing? Let us go. Mothman, stop. Mothman, Come on, Mothman, what are you doing? Let go. Bring the two to the brain. Oh, I'm sorry about that. Bring them to the brain. Danny, hit him with the sauce. Bring them to the brain. Well, it's a little bit spicy. Stay back. Don't come any closer. Hey, what's wrong? You grabbed us by our head and said: "Take them to the brain." What? No. Danny dislocated your finger trying to get free. I think I would remember if you did dislocated my f... For the record, I immediately apologize for that. Let me see that. Don't worry. This will only hurt... a lot. Thank you. Amigos (friend), I have not been totally honest with you. My headaches They are not normal headaches. In the headache, I hear voices that tell me what to do. That hot sauce is the only thing that clears my mind. You didn't think that would have been useful information to tell us before you tried to kill us. This is why I'm telling you now. In case you tried to kill us again. Yes. Very well, proceed. I didn't tell you because it would make you think I was a monster. Yeah, you are a monster. But you're only a monster if you act like a monster. Now's your chance to prove who you really are. Help us shut down that portal once and for all. What did you mean when you said "Take them to the big bad brain"? There's a guy in charge? No, man, I mean a natural brain. No way. The whole thing is powered by a giant, disembodied, pulsating brain. It's pretty asqueroso (gross) to be honest. Yeah, but it's our fault. We have to destroy it. If we want to kill this thing. We're gonna need supplies. Come on. Come on. It rings. Hello? Miss Evans? Want... it... to...stay... alive. Wrong number. They got Ulanov. Just because the portal was my experiment. Doesn't that mean this is my fault. Professor Stern. We need your ... So, Darling. It's okay, Tesla. We'll go to a new school. Everything will be okay. Take anything you might need in the fifth dimension. Flashlight. Safety goggles. Pillow? Magnifying glass. Liquid nitrogen. Flair. Chocolate bar. Chocolate bar? There's always room for snacks. I don't want to eat whatever weird food they have in the fifth dimension. Right, Mothman? Mothman. Ah, good idea. The food there is scarier than the monsters. Hey, do you think we time to get churros (donuts)? No time for churros (donuts). The tin foil should stop those purple tentacles from making a connection with your brain. You sure about that? Of course not. But it can't hurt. No bracelet for me. I'm a monster. I must warn you to prepare yourselves, for a horrifying journey. You will see things in the fifth dimension, that you wish you were never born. Delicious. Come on. My love, it's time for me to work and become a hero But we'll, ah, have dinner tomorrow. We need to get past those monsters and make it to the atomic particle reactor, in one piece. But there are far too many. Guys, This school has been around for over 500 years. My grandfather studied here. My father too. It's our duty to protect it. If anyone's going to better stop these things. It's the smartest kids in the world. We need your help to blow some stuff up and cause a diversion. Can you help us? Yea. What's the PH? It's a hundred percent acid. Neutralize it with a base. Yahoo, here doggy, doggy. Here I am. I will distract him. We'll meet in the Hall. We need to go to the lab. Hi, M...Ma...Martha, Lupe. Nice to see you all again. Easy, girls, easy. Would you like to dance? Ahoy, Martha, hea. Ah. Ho ho. Stay, stay. Oh, no. Easy. He won't be able to last for long. Where are you going? Trust me. I've done this before. Get ready you guys. Stop, stop! Lithium hydroxide coming up. Nice work. Mmm, my moneys on the hamster. Don't worry, he'll return to his normal size in a few minutes. We'll take care of them. Come on now, Mothman. Lets go. I can't. I can't go back. Yes you can. Come on. If you have seen what I have seen... Danny, we've got to do something quick. It's time to Moth Up. We're going in. And you better be behind us. I'm sorry, Danny. He left us. I know. But we've gotta move. Ah, Liz. Danny. Hey. Give me back my chocolate. Danny, give it to them. Leave my friends alone. Mothman. You came back. What are you doing here? You are my new familia (family). And nothing is more important than family. I guest he Moth Up. Your darn right he did. Alright mothman. It 's a good thing you're here. Because we have no idea what we're doing. Lead the way. Of course, my lord. Are you serious? Danny. Come on. We gotta keep moving. Um... Ah, guys. Danny. Wow. They got everyone. Miss Evans. She's okay. That's what I'd call a generous assessment of situation. I meant she's not dead. I'm just saying you got a low bar for okay The more brains he drains. The more powerful this place becomes. Gracious (Thank you). It got Tammy. And Tammy 2, and Tammy 3. And I can only assume that's Tammy 4, and Tammy 5, and 6, and 7. No. if you unplug her now. She will never wake up. We must stop it at the source . We have to save everyone before it's too late. Stern? Amiga (friend). Amiga (friend)? We used to work together. He's my colega (colleague). Did you bring the salsa? Stern. We're going to save you. No offense. But your colega (colleague) stinks. This way. We camp here for the night. Sounds good to me. I can't take another step. Cover yourself in the puss. Ew. For what? When the night bugs come. They will eat the puss. And you will still have a skin in the morning. I beg your pardon? Night bugs. They feast on flesh. How are you okay with this? It's only logical. I hate bugs more then I hate puss You don't want no cucarachas (cockroaches) up there, man. No thanks. I don't plan on sleeping. Get off. This place sucks. ...to the brain... Oh, Liz. Liz. Why would you wake me up when I'm covered in bugs? I'm gonna be traumatized for life. You'd rather be covered in bugs and not know about it? Absolutely Would you want to be awake during surgery? No. There you go. I didn't wake you up to argue about the merits of disassociation. Listen to Mothman. He doesn't sound good. Oh, great brain. I will do as you command. He's just dreaming. Bring them to the brain. Sounds like a nightmare. So you may suck the brains of Liz and Danny. That's an oddly specific nightmare. Yeah, let's wake him up. Must... bring... Liz... Danny... Danny, hit him with the Ghost. Oh no. Must... bring... It's empty. to...the... Run. You hav'ta get away from me. Mothman, no. We not going to leave you. We're not going anywhere. We are a team and we stick together. Fight it, Mothman. You're only a monster if you let yourself be a monster. I'm not a monster. I'm...I'm not a monster. That's it, keep saying it. Come on, Mothman, you can do it. I am not a monster. Mothman? The voices, they stopped. Let him go you purple piece... Danny don't. You know what happens if you disconnect him. We can't just leave him here. There's only one way to free him now. We've got to go to the brain and shut it down. This whole thing is my fault. I opened the portal. I'm the reason there are brain tentacles attached to half the school. And now Mothman's is gone. Get out of here, Liz. Before my next stupid idea get you killed. But we're a team. I caused this problem and I'll fix it on my own. I don't need something to happen to you, too. I'm a solo operator for a reason. Stupid fifth dimension. Stupid vines. Stupid temporal bracelet. Danny. Let him go. Are you okay? Thank you. So? Are we a team yet? I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said that stuff. I can't do this without you. Good, because I've been thinking. Mothman said the fifth dimension was a living organism. And we're looking for a brain. What do these tendrils look like to you? Disgusting, veiny, death hoses? Nerves. Like a nervous system that runs through the whole organism. The tentacles will lead us right to it. Like a map. A disgusting, veiny, pulsating, purple map. Honestly, I prefer a GPS. It's some kind of membrane. ♪ Insane in the membrane. ♪ Don't start. We must be close. I bet the membrane is here to stop anything from getting near the brain. Stop this. You okay? I think so. Though I admit that plan wasn't fully thought out. Unless you want to do some major exfoliating. You might want to stand back. Good thinking. Hurry. This way. These tentacles look like they're all plugged into stuff. I don't think they're gonna be a problem. Well that makes it easy. It's a brainstorm. Really Danny? Puns at a time like this? Fine, what would you call it then? A fifth dimension meteorological anomaly. Oh, yeah, because that really rolls off the tongue. Let's do this. These are our friends. We can't hurt them. What are we gonna do? We gotta split them up? Split them and tie them. It's working. Come on. Look. Liz. Help me get the flashlight and the magnifying glass. I couldn't get the magnifying glass. Watch out. Danny. I'm okay. But I still need that magnifying glass. Throw it. Danny. No. Danny. Let him. Danny, no. Danny, you're alive. I knew it would work. Brain Freeze. Oh come on, that was good. What else are you gonna say when you are literally freezing a giant brain.? I'll allow it. Stern? Stern, my friend. Stern, It's me, Juan. Oh my goodness, Juan. Oh, you haven't changed a bit gordito (chubby). Run. The portal. It's closing. It looseing power because the brain is dead. It's too far. We never make it out in time. We're never gonna get out in time. Hey, hold it. Initiate field trip pickup sequence. Field trip? Go on. Go. Go. Mothman, quick. Stop. We've gotta get Mothman. Don't worry, Danny. I got the little thing I like to call disgusting moth wings. Adiós (Goodbye), Manuel. Lets get out of here. Francisca. Dear audience. Let 's all look forward to a wrestling match today of a very special kind. In the right corner of the ring we see Mothman. He is now taking a violent leap in the direction of his opponent Francisca. The two wedge each other but Mothman stays on top. Francisca can now break free and push Mothman away in a wide arc. The two are now back in the ring and the fight can begin again. Again the two attack each other but neither can gain an advantage. But suddenly Mothman dares a surprise attack and lands on Francisca's back. This can shake him off again. But will that be enough for a victory? Because Mothman starts another jump in the direction of Francisca. Where's Mothman? He didn't make it. He gave his life to save us. I didn't give my life for no one. I want to live. Mothman. Mothman. I got four arms. Lots of room for hugs. So now what? Eat churro (donuts). Okay, but then what? Danny serves a lifetime of detention? But we probably win the nobel prize for physics. Sounds good, but we start with the churro (donuts). Welcome to Cranston's "Genius of the Year" Award Ceremony. And this year's award for discovering a new dimension, and saving the whole school from total annihilation, goes to Liz Fizzerton and Danny Dawkins. Hi. Guys. I always knew he had it in him. Thank you. The world tells us that geniuses are solo operators But i've learned that genius is something created by a group of great minds working together. Hey amigo (friend). Yes, yes. Thank you. I'm just so happy. It's so good to be back as part of the Cranston people. Vamos: quinta dimensión (Come on, try it: Fifth Dimension.) Quinta dimensión. (Fifth dimension). Bueno (Good). Oh Man, T...T...T...That's yours... Yelp, that's my father. He wants to have lunch with us later. Wow. All that research grant money was enough to fix the atomic particle reactor. Hey, do you think there's a sixth dimension? There is only one way to find out.
