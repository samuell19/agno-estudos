Hi-yah! The world destroyer will arrive in Earth's atmosphere T-minus 26 hours. Ah. The dismal planet Earth. Such a beautiful... yet pointless little, blue marble. Pathetic! Rattle! Shriek! Yes, your Hideousness? Prepare my shuttle for departure. - Do it! - Right away, Commander Kruel! Ow! Watch it! - He told me to. - Uh, no, he didn't. It's my turn! Morons. It's time to pay those weak-minded cretins a visit and introduce them to their new leader: Me. My Encapsulator will then transform the Earthlings into a ferocious drone army once again controlled by me. The troops will then do my bidding and claim the planet in the name of Kruel. Yoo-hoo? Anybody home? Anybody here order a serious butt-whooping? Huh? Rattle! Shriek! Attack! Goodnight. Hi-yah! Get the Encapsulator! - Right away. - Oy-oy. Agent Action. So we meet again. You remember me, eh, Kruel? - Give it to me! - I'm in charge! Guess you're not as dumb as you are ugly. - Prepare to die! - Not today, Lizard-Lips. Oh, we'd better hide it from Agent Action. I will end you! Hey, Kruel! How about a little game of ball? Action blast! You need to learn some manners. Blasters, power up. Take that! Time to blow this Popsicle stand. Sector D self-destruct activated. Uh-oh. See you later, alligator! Yee-ha! Out to save the world, home in time for dinner. Huh? Rotten, noisy kids. Oh. Rattle! Shriek! All the damage has been sealed off. Where's my Encapsulator? The Encapsulator? Well, we hid it in a place no one would find it. What are you fools saying? We shoved it out of the trash compactor and it's probably down to Earth. Imbeciles! Prepare my East Wing shuttle. Right away, Commander Kruel. That Encapsulator mustn't fall into the hands of one of those idiotic Earthlings. - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! Awesome, dude. That was awesome. Hey, I gotta go. My mom's here. - Come back on Thursday. - Copy that, sewer rat! Good job. You think so? You'll get it eventually. Thanks, Sis. Sure thing, meat head. You guys are totally gonna dominate the talent show. I'd like to thank everyone who voted for us. Told myself I wasn't gonna cry. Oh, hi, Tracy. Tracy! Tracy! Hey, guys. What's up? Did you hear us rehearsing? Yeah, actually, that's why I'm here. Really? Oh, great, so... what did you think? I thought you guys were amazing. Are you... you serious? Yes, I did. But my dad... Not so much. He called the police? Your ride's here, Brewster. There they are, Officer. Those hoodlums right there. Playing music so loud, I can't hear myself think. And because of the music, poor Edgar here has a very serious case of nervous gas. See what I mean? Okay, Officer, Mr. Binkle, Edgar... I'm sorry. We were just finishing up. Oh, you're finished, all right. Officer, I would like to press charges against these juvenile delinquents for disturbing the peace and write up a citation for this fire hazard of a front yard. Uh... Brew... Oh, no. Oh, no, Mom. No. - Oh. - Mr. Binkle? Brewster, what is going on? Oh, I'll tell you what's going on. Good. I am at my rope's end with your rotten kids. Always playing that noisy racket and then misfiring paint balls into my backyard. Noisily splashing around in that murky pool. - Are you crying, Mr... - I'm not crying. I'm upset. Look, I'm... They're just being teenagers. You know? They're being a public nuisance. Take control of your brats. - And mow your lawn! - Wow. And keep your balls out of my yard. Well... Tracy! Home! Now. Get... Pick up your balls. What is this? Here you go, ma'am, have a nice day. $300? It was a beautiful day today in Sanders City. A warm and sunny 80 degrees just above the average for this time of year. $300. All because you couldn't keep the volume down on your guitar? Don't forget the other ticket. Another $50. Because Brewster never mows the lawn. Thanks. Mom... The talent show is coming up. We were just rehearsing. You know you're not supposed to play music on the lawn. Bob Binkle has it out for us, and yet you continually antagonize him. That man's on a power trip. You gave his dog indigestion. You can't pin that one on me. That dog's been a fart machine since way back. I know that. And I don't care. When I'm at work, I need to be able to count on you. And that means staying out of Bub's way, mowing the lawn, and taking care of your sister. I can't do this on my own, Brewster. I need you to be a hero. You know, what if I just want to be a kid? Oh. Okay. Well. ...encounters, proving that... Then plan on being treated accordingly. - What are you doing? - Mm-hmm. - Mom. - Hm. Mm-hmm. Mom, seriously. ...action. A mysterious... Thank you. Okay, well... As of now, Miss Robinson is your new babysitter. A babysitter? - Mm-hmm. - You heard her. But... but I'm 15. Oh, well, you should have thought about that before you got two tickets in one day. I don't need a babysitter. You don't understand. She makes us eat pimento loaf sandwiches. Oh, boo-hoo. It's already done. Starting this weekend, when I'm away at the convention, you have a babysitter. Paul Mergers here with Action Live News. Once again, the mysterious superhero known as Agent Action sprung into action this afternoon as he was caught on video doing yet another good deed. Look, it's Agent Action. Is this gonna be on the six o'clock or the ten o'clock news? This is gonna be on the six and the ten. Oh, both. Oh, God. Great, great. Do you know the weather guy? So could you tell us a little bit about what happened with you and Agent Action today? Oh. Yes. Um, So I was walking down Third Avenue. Um, it was early this morning, and I'd just gone to the farmer's market because me and my friend Marcy, we're gonna be doing a cleanse. So I went out to get a ton of stuff like kale, celery. I mean, I'm not really into this cleanse thing, but she says it looks great and she lost ten pounds in, like, two weeks. I'm distracted. This horrible man, I mean, horrible, just swooped in and grabbed my purse. I mean, I should have heard him coming, because he was wearing corduroys, you know? And when he ran away, it was like... But I wasn't paying attention. So he grabs my purse, he starts to get away. I'm panicking. And out of nowhere, Agent Action just swooped in and, like, just grabbed the guy and, like, saved the day. Isn't it wonderful that we can have someone like Agent Action out there helping us in a time of need? You know what? You said it perfectly. It is just so nice to know that there is still people in this world that you can rely on. People in this world that you can rely on. People in this world that you can rely on. People in this world that you can rely on. Need some company? Sure. So... she gave you the treatment? We have a babysitter. - A babysitter? - Yep. We're staying at Miss Robinson's for the weekend, while my mom works a convention. Talk about cruel and unusual punishment. I don't get it. How am I supposed to be a hero when all she does is just treat me like a little kid? Show her you can be responsible. - She'll drop it. - Wait. You can be responsible, can't you? Of course I can. You guys excited for the show? Yeah, I guess. Snap out of it, dude. I personally can't wait to dominate that stage. We should get your mom to chauffeur us like rock stars. Can I ride with you guys? Yeah, of course you can. Yeah, we couldn't do a show without you. - Really? - Yeah, you're our roadie. I mean, who else is gonna bring us water and keep those screaming girls away from us? - Who else? - Brewster. Mom says you gotta wrap it up and get your tushy in here. You've got to pack for the babysitter's house. This cannot be my life. It just can't. It can't. Get a move on, meat head. Woah! Encapsulator signal located. Commander Kruel! We've located the vicinity of the Encapsulator. Where is it? It's somewhere in a small town on Earth. We're closing in on its location. - Just find it. - Aye-aye, your hideousness. Uh, one more thing. It appears someone is trying to activate the device. Uh-oh. We leave for Earth immediately! - Aye-aye, sir! - Aye-aye, sir! Mom. Please don't make us go. Brewster, we have already been through this. It's not a big deal. It's only gonna be a couple of days. Okay? There she is. Yep. There she is. Well, howdy-doodle! Looks like we're gonna have a couple special visitors this weekend. Are you kids ready to have some fun? Hey, Miss Robinson. Oh, call me Aunt Patty. We're practically family. I used to change this one's diapers. You go, Aunt Patty. Oh, I'll go, all right? Can I get a woot-woot? Woot-woot! You got a woot-woot from me. Stir it up and stir it up. Stir it up. Thank you so much for watching them. Oh, it's no problem. You know, I love kids. And kids love me. Now, come on, and give me some sugar. Come on! Come in. Come on. Okay. Oh. Looks like someone's got a case of the grouchies. Yeah, uh, we're going through some growing pains. Oh, sure. Yeah, well, I know how that goes, you know? I was once a complicated teenager, too. - Were you? - Yeah, funny story. One time, when I was 13 years old, I got my head stuck in a large pickle jar. - Your head? - It hurt. Yeah. I just dove right in for a pickle, before I knew it... I'd love to hear more about your pickle... Oh, there's way more to the story. No, I have got to go, because the convention... I'm gonna late, so... - Bye. - Bye, mother. - Be good. - I'll think about it. - Hey! - You got it, sister. Okay. Bye, Brewster. - Bye. - Uh, look, I don't want to hear about any shenanigans, okay? I'll keep him in check. - You go, sister. - Hasta la â™ª bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye! Okay. Who's ready for a pimento loaf sandwich? - Me! Me! - Yes! Lunchtime, Brewster. Another toy... in my yard. What is this thing? Lunch is served. - One for you. - Thank you. And there you go. Oh, this is my cousin, Big Earl. He's staying with me for a couple of weeks - till his gout clears up. - What's gout? Ugh, you don't wanna know while you're eating. Suit yourself. Bon appetit. That's French for chow down. All right, now I gotta go back inside. Mr. Fuzzy Pants needs me. Today's the day he gets his nails clipped. Wait, I thought you just said his name was Big Earl. No, Mr. Fuzzy Pants is my cat, silly. Oh, I should've known that one. Okay, listen, I don't mean to be rude, but we don't need you, like, at all. I'm 15, and the only reason why we're here is 'cause my mom blew a gasket. A gasket, huh? You know, we kind of do our own thing, so all I need from you is your wireless password. Oh, I don't have Internet. Got all the facts I need right up here. I call it my worldwide head. You don't have Internet? No, no Internet. All we have here is cable news and crafting books. Oh, excuse me, Aunt Patty, but, uh, guess who coughed up a hairball on the credenza again? Oh, the life of a cat mommy. 24/7, am I right? I am living... in a nightmare. Bon appetit. What is this thing? Oh. "Encapsulator Transmorpher." Huh. Warrior type. Yeah, must be some sort of video game. Let's see. Oh, "Drone Warrior." Uh. Let's see, "Hover Beast." "Battle Beast"? Oh. Well, I don't know how this thing got in my yard, but it's mine now. "Launch sequence." More like game over. Go for Eddie. - What are you doing? - Waking up, thanks to you. How's the babysitter? Well, so far I've eaten a mystery meat sandwich sat in doll furniture and learn that gout is something really bad. Hmm. Sounds like a party. It's so boring here. Oh, she doesn't even have Internet. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you go by my house, grab our guitars, and bring Kelly. We can just rehearse out on the front porch. You sure that's a good idea? She's too busy giving her cat a mani-pedi. She won't even notice. I don't know, B. Aren't you in enough trouble? Well, I got to do something to kill the time. There is zero action here. All right. But me and Kelly have karate at three. Just get over here. Hm... At least two days... All righty, nails are clipped, kitty box is clean. Who's ready for some banjo? Aunt Patty. You heard it correctly. Like something out of a comic book. There is a small, unidentified craft hovering over the downtown area. Eyewitnesses say the UFO just appeared out of nowhere. The government has yet to make a statement, but we are getting preliminary reports that this craft could possibly be not of this world. I want to point out that so far, this craft is showing no sign of hostility. There is no need to panic. I repeat, there is no need to panic. Shall I obliterate the city? Why would I destroy something that will ultimately be mine? No. Activate the cloaking shield and relocate. And just like that, the small craft seems to have just... Should I be having a complete meltdown over this? No, no, no. It's probably just a... ...some sort of transport shuttle... ...a weather balloon. It's always a weather balloon. No big deal. ...we're waiting for... This is a huge deal. Never seen anything... Are they hostile? People are running through the streets! See what I mean? Nothing. Hey, uh, I've got an idea. How about if I, um... go to the store and buy us some... ice cream? You like ice cream, right? I'm a kid, aren't I? Yes. Yes, you certainly are a kid. So I'm just gonna go and get my poncho... - Mm-hmm. - ...in the kitchen. I'm gonna go in there and go out the back door and head out to the store to get some ice cream. Yeah. And, Aunt Patty, please be very careful when you're getting the ice cream. Give me a break. Uh, the kitchen's unlocked, right? All set to go. Action-vator activated. Main floor. Second Floor, pantry, canned peaches, jellies and green bean storage. Third Floor, quilting, Strategy Room, nuclear defense research. Fourth Floor, super suit generator. Time to find evil. - Ready, Double A? - Ready for action. Super suit generator powering up. Powering up. Transformation power charging. System ready. Agent Action, activate. Suit generator sequence will now commence. Super power activated. Select destination. Setting quadrants... for downtown. Let's do this. Prepping for lift-off. Hey, Mom. Hi, Brewster. It's Mom. Um, I'm just, uh, calling to check in. You just left. Yes, I know, but, sweetie, I just... I heard something on the radio about the possibility of UFOs, so... Three... Two... â™ª One... No... No UFOs here. Just crazy cat ladies. Aunt Patty is not a crazy cat lady. I mean, she's... she's not crazy. She's a cat lady, but she's doing... Okay, you know what? Never mind. Just... call me if anything comes up. Hey. You sure that it's okay we go to Miss Robinson's? Yeah, it's okay. Besides, it'll be good to play for a new set of ears. Stop wasting time with that stupid band. Uh... Eddie? What? About the new set of ears... Hey, sorry, the Banners aren't home right now. I said, no more rock 'n' roll! Hey, what are you doing? Yeah, who do you think you are? I am... The Bubinator! Mr. Binkle? [chuckling Look out! Did he say "The Bubinator"? Yeah. What are you doing? - Getting out of here. - With a hammer? - You got a better plan? - Got'cha. On three. One, two, three. I love. My monster makeover. Oh? The Bubinator is triggered. Oh, look at that! You can't stop The Bubinator! Unidentified projectile entering quadrant. Commander Kruel, we're picking up a projectile that's heading right for us. It's Agent Action. Warp, relocate then cloak the ship. I'll deal with that clanking cretin soon enough. - Yes, your horribleness. - Right away. Target lost. What the heck? All right, come on. Where are you at? I'm having trouble tracking you, Double A. What's your location? I'm on target. No sign of Kruel's shuttle. The tracking signal just vanished. Uh, he may have changed positions. Uh, I'm gonna rescan the entire city. No problemo, big guy. Scanning for enemy craft. Multiple signals located. Okay, we're getting multiple signals in different locations now. I... I don't like this, no, you should get back so we can regroup because either Kruel is scrambling our signals, or, I hate to say this, There's more than one villain in town. Look out! I'll teach you to respect your elders! Paintball! There's no stopping... This will teach you. The Bubinator! Hey, Bubinator! Huh? Reach for the sky. Or get ready to taste the rainbow. Say hello to my little friend. Revenge will be mine! Hi, Brewster. Tracy! Uh... Hi. What are you doing at Miss Robinson's house? Uh... I was helping her with the lawn. That's nice of you. She's always helping everyone else out. It's good to pay it forward. Uh, yeah, I mean, that's... I pay it forward all the time. That's just my way. For all she's done for you, I can see why. Done for me? Didn't she tell you? She's on the neighborhood watch with my dad. She's talked him out of calling the police on your band a bunch of times. She did that? Yeah. Too bad she wasn't there yesterday. Speaking of, sorry. My dad can get kind of uptight. Uptight? I hadn't noticed. I mean, what else are dads for if they're not laying down the law for virtually everyone in the neighborhood? Yeah, try being raised by him. I wonder where he is. He was supposed to pick me up from the mall, but he never showed up. I'm sure he's hovering around here somewhere. Dirty yard! Well, Commander Kruel, we have excellent news. You found the Encapsulator. Our radar is going bananas. We're picking up signals only the resonator's powers can emit. Someone has your technology Where? Looking in on signal one. What is that? I don't know. But he seems to have his panties in a wad. Enough. Show me the second signal Right away, sir. There's a strong signal coming from this garage. Uh, not the garage, turn over to the humans. Maybe they activated the device. There's nothing there, either. Fools! The stronger signal is coming from a place the humans call Lake view Avenue. Agent Action... There's a tremendous amount of energy emanating from the structure. He must have the Encapsulator. You found his headquarters. Well done, my bucket head minions. Well, I do what I can. It was really nothing. Ah! Head to those coordinates and prepare for battle! Right away, Commander Kruel. Aye, aye. Kimmy? Aunt Patty? Big Earl? Mr. Fuzzy Pants? Hey. Where's Aunt Patty? She's out saving the planet. Seriously? Come on, where is she? I told you, she's a superhero. A superhero? Really? Okay, what's her superhero name? No, wait, let me guess. Is it... Bad Sandwich Lady? Or maybe it's The Claw Clipper. No. How about... Agent Action. Action-vator activated. Okay. You got me. What is this? Is this where she meditates with Mr. Fuzzy Pants? No, it's the elevator to her secret lair. Oh. Going down. A button. Wait, wait! Kimmy! Kimmy! Get me out of here! I believe you! Agent Action stats stable. Big Earl? Uh, Brewster. What is this place? Oh, this. Uh, this is Aunt Patty's home gym. You know what a workout freak she is. - Very healthy. - She is? I don't see any workout equipment. Uh, because... Very good question. And it's a simple answer. Because it is being delivered on Monday. Yes. We're just gonna wait for the paint to dry... I need to run a diagnostic on my helmet. Brewster? Aunt Patty. Who wants some ice cream? Where's your brother? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Uh, you'd be very surprised. Kimmy, something crazy is going on. Where's Brewster? Down in the secret lair. For over a hundred years, the Robinson family, also known to the world's secret agencies as the Action Pack, has been in serious action. Since the first time that great, great, great, great-grandpa Robinson donned - the very first super suit... - Aw, look at him. And started defending the world from evil, the Robinson family has continued the heroic tradition of keeping us safe throughout time. As each decade passes and a family member retires, a new member of the Robinson clan is chosen to carry on the tradition of fighting evil. A person that's brave, pure, strong, level headed, transformed into a true warrior of justice. Endowed with super strength, the ability to fly to amazing heights all made possible by an identity-concealing exo-suit, inspired by top secret alien technology unearthed years ago by Phineas Robinson himself. Agent Action, always ready for action. Helping the world stay safe by taking out evil. - One bad guy at a time. - One bad guy at a time. Huh? You... You're Agent Action? Yes, I am. And now that you know, I'm gonna have to kill you. Just kidding. I'm just pulling your leg. But, yeah, it's true. I'm him or... her. Agent Action. What about this cool suit? It's unbelievably coo... Wait, you're Agent Action! What are you doing? Turning on the secret elevator. Elevator? To the underground lair. Are you paying attention? Kimmy, where's Brewster? It's not working now. Hey, Shnookie! Where are we? Uh-oh, we've got visitors! - Who might they be? - Pathetic Earthlings. Where is he? Hey! What an adorable little sapling. Tell me, my sweet child, where is the Earthling known as Agent Action? - I don't know. - Are you sure? The only thing I'm sure of... Yes? Is that your breath really, really, really, really stinks. Like, you really need a mint. Seize them! I'll locate Agent Action! He needs a little snack! Commander, there's nobody here! Hey, ugly. Ugh. - Weren't you watching them? - I turned around - and the elevator opened. - Okay. You're a superhero, right? You're kind of short. No, no, no, no. It's not about the size of your biceps. It's what's in your heart that makes a superhero. You seriously didn't just say that, did you? I could barely get it out. No, but I get what you mean. That suit. It's pretty dope. Thanks, uh... I guess it is very... dope. But really, you know, you can't tell anyone about this. Well, even if I did, who would believe me? No, no, Brewster, listen to her. There are nefarious alien forces on Earth that are up to no good right now. Nothing can slow the progress of Agent Action from stopping them. Okay. And, action! Is this... It's on? We're going? Okay, thank you. Kimmy. This transmission is being broadcast to the pathetic bucket of bolts known as Agent Action. You may have slipped away from me this time, but I suggest you rethink your strategy and surrender. Or this delightful little girl will spend the rest of her life scrubbing the floors of my intergalactic battle ship. Agh. Wow. That hurt. That was rude. Better catch my breath. That is never gonna happen. I command you to bring me my Encapsulator and join my army of drones as I invade planet Earth. You have one hour to execute this task. Otherwise, your little friend here will enjoy a lifetime of scrubba-dub-dub at the other end of the galaxy. Ow! What is wrong with you? Oh... Oh... He has Kimmy! Okay, okay, look, what does he mean? Bring him the Encapsulator? Our technology is only inspired by their device. She cannot spend the rest of her life as some sort of outer space housekeeper. She has soccer on Monday. I don't know. Unless... somehow, he lost one of his own Encapsulators. I was supposed to be keeping an eye on her. She has dreams of becoming a miniature horse trainer. And my mom's gonna kill me. "Oh, hey, son. Where's your sister?" Oh, only 300 light years away on the other end of the galaxy. - Brewster! - Cork it! Look, we only have an hour. And we have lift-off. Preparing to leave Earth's atmosphere. Would you like some pretzels and a nice cold cola? Just kidding. Generating wormhole to Outer Centaurus Here we go. Ah, my battleship. Welcome to your new place of employment. Get over here. Oh, my God. Tell me, do you have many janitorial skills? Do you need to floss? Why are you always so mean to me? She scares me. I'll go rescue Kimmy. You, try to track his Encapsulator. Roger that. And you, keep a low profile. Go upstairs, take that meatloaf out of the freezer. And Double A... be careful. Launching! Yee-haw! Stand by for pressurization. Okay, enough pressure, enough pressure! Copy that, Double A. I saw a UFO. I saw the UFO. Don't tell me I didn't see the UFO. I saw the UFO. When I say there's a UFO, there's a UFO. I get my eyes checked every year. My hips aren't too good, and I've had three knee replacements. But I can... I can see. I saw the U... Oh! Hello, honey! Oh, aren't you adorable! Hi, little... doggy? Ooh... I've never seen a breed quite like you. You're so... purple. And you're standing on two legs. Oh! Would you like some water? I have wa... No? How about... oops, a cracker. I only took one bite out of it. No? Oh, you have a belly ache? Oh. What can we do to... To relieve that tummy ache? Huh? Expired tag. Dirty car. Hello, world! My name's The Bubinator. What's yours? A dog not on a leash? Hey! Where are your dog tags? Oh! It's on, mutt! When I'm done with you you'll have a poodle! Yes! Where'd you go? Oh! Edgar? Is that you? Oh. Oh, my little angel! It is you! Oh. Oh! What's happened to you? You got near that contraption, didn't you? Oh, you bad boy! Oh, look what you've become. Oh, look what I've become. Well, that machine has turned us into these horrible beasts! We have to get home and reverse it. I'm not a bad guy. I'm a good guy. I want to become my kind, gentle, level-headed self. Come on. Let's go home. Turn off that leaf blower! Come on! Cloaking radar activated. Heading out to space. The old final frontier. Have safe flight, Double A. Initiating warp speed. Wormhole generating. Stand by. Here we go! Entering spin cycle. Hold tight, old friend. You're almost there. Man, I'm not gonna lie, I just got an atomic wedgie from that. Wedgie alert. Wedgie alert. Wedgie alert. Wedgie alert. But, other than the wedgie, status is good. Okay, I've gotta lock that pantry. Yeah. Big Earl... It's my mom. Should I pick it up? Hey, Mom. Hi. Just checking in. Well, it's good to hear your voice. Uh, yeah, everything here is fine. Yeah. How's Kimmy? Kimmy? Your sister. She's just... out of this world, Mom. I mean, just terrific. Just terrific. Yeah. I gotta go. Put her on. Put her on? - She wants me to put her on. - Well, you can't do that! She's not here! I can't put her on. Why not? Why not? Because she... She's, uh... Because she went with Aunt Patty to get ice cream. Uh, because she went to get ice cream with Aunt Patty. Aunt Patty? Wow, you've come a long way since nine o'clock this morning. You have no idea how far I've come. Okay, well... Thanks for trying. I guess I'll see you later. - Oh. - Much, much, much later. Okay, all right. Well... all right. Bye. Yeah. All right. Well, I love you, son. Bye, Brew... Brewster. Bye, Mom. Love you too. So does anyone want to fill us in? Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm jamming his cargo door security signal. You should be able to get in. I'm all in. Where is he? Let me at him. Okay. Stop. Look to your right. You got a security camera... Not anymore. Not bad for a small town babysitter. Great job, Double A. The self-destruct blast screwed up most of their sensors, so they shouldn't be able to detect you. But look, I need you to keep moving. There are life forms straight ahead. Roger that. Enabling defense systems. Defense system enabled. The babysitter is locked, loaded and ready to rumble! Remember, Kruel is expecting you. So your best strategy is the element of surprise. Oh, he's gonna be surprised, all right. Agent A's about to crack open a serious can of alien butt-whoop. Nothing like a good, old-fashioned surprise attack. I'm like a ninja, dropping in out of nowhere. Uh-oh... The Commander will be most displeased! Oh... Come, quickly, Edgar. We've got to reverse our monster situation. Then turn that device over to the authorities. Where's the reverse switch? Come on! System error. Mega... Rebooting. - System error. - Ugh, system error. Mega... Mega... - Mega mode? - Mega... Mega. -Rebooting -Come on! System error. Rebooting. System error. Rebooting. Mega, mega, mega, mega mode. Mega, mega, mega, mega mode. Mega, mega, mega, mega mode. Put it in reverse, you piece of junk! System error. Are you crazy? Mega Monster Mode launching sequence. Oh, uh, never mind! I'm just fine the way I am. Purple is actually a good color on me... No! No! Daddy! Are you doing okay, Double A? Have you located Kimmy? Nobody's here, but us legendary action heroes. Once you find the girl, create a diversion. Then head to the East Shuttle bay and enter his transport pod as fast as you can. Once you're inside, you can launch with the hack code I've uploaded. 10-4, good buddy. - I've found Kimmy. - Good. Try to get her out of there without being spotted. Get to that escape pod. Will do. I'll be in and out before you know it. Psst, Kimmy. Psst, Kimmy! Hey, Kimmy! Kimmy! Kimmy! Run, it's a trap! - You're in big trouble. - Bring it on! Let's teach this babysitter a lesson. Uncle! Here, put this on. Follow that map to the escape hatch. Lock yourself inside. If I'm not there in five minutes, call Big Earl tell him to get you back home. Go, go, go, go, go! Leaving so soon, my child? I wouldn't hear of it. You haven't even finished with your chores yet. Where's your toothbrush? I have a nasty mold problem in my shower. - How's my breath now? - Kruel. Huh? Get ready to retire! Picking on little kids? Eh, big boy? [electricity crackling Action blast! Action Cam connection lost. Re-establishing link. Finally figured out, who's the boss, eh, Kruel? Come on, Kimmy! We gotta get out of here before this lousy lizard comes too. Let's go! Not so fast, Agent Action. You two aren't going anywhere just yet. But don't worry. In the next few hours, you'll be back on planet Earth. But as part of my army of slaves. It's so much better than being just another worthless baby sitter. There's nothing wrong with being a babysitter, lizard face. You, stand guard and you, get me another one of my Encapsulators. Yes, your royal horribleness. It's time for you two to make some big changes. Connection lost. Mission failed. This is very, very bad. Very, very bad? Blue suit activated. Regenerating exo-suit. - What are we gonna do? - Enter Encapsulator chamber. - It's what I'm gonna do. - Blue suit nearly complete. Wait, no, what are you doing? - Going up there. - No, you can't! What if something happens to you too? We don't know how to run this thing and... Blue suit ready for mounting. - You have gout. - Enter Encapsulator chamber. Look, we have no other choice. Prepare for blue suit generation sequence. She's my sister. And I'm going to save her. Wait, no, Brewster! No. Subject locked. Blue suit ready for mounting. Prepare for blue suit generation sequence. Suit generation complete. Ready for action. All systems online. Launch sequence initiated. Okay. And for the record, this is crazy. You don't know what you're doing. Stand by for lift-off. Oh, gosh.

Turbo-power initiated. Brewster vitals stable. Action blaster online. Prepare for lift-off. Here we go. This is amazing. Setting quadrants for Outer Centauri. Destination Outer Centauri. Here we go. - Let's do this. - Three, two, one. - Yes! - Yeah! All systems are go. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, boy. Okay, this is really happening. - â™ª Pee-pee alert. - Oh, I probably should've peed before I left. - Whoa! - Altitude rising. Helmet pressurizing. Oh, pressure is. Thank goodness. Wormhole generating. Stand by. Wow. I never would have thought he'd be the one to save us. Commander Kruel's ship dead ahead. Okay, who's ringing? Oh, it's Brewster's. Oh, it's his mom. No, no, I'm not gonna talk to her. No, no, no. I'm gonna say something stupid. No, no, no. You have to. I'll screw up the whole... No, no. Uh, hello? - Who's this? - Oh. Hi, Mrs. Banner. It's Kelly. Oh, hi, Kelly. Where's Brewster? You just missed him. He... took off. Oh, good. Well, you know, I've been telling him he should get some more air. Oh, he's getting a lot of air. A lot. Uh-huh. Um, well, listen, I have some good news for him. He doesn't have to spend the night. I'm coming home early. - You're coming home early? - Yeah. Apparently my boss has an allergy to shellfish. Threw up in his boss's lap, so, convention over. Oh, I'm sure he's gonna be very surprised. What time can I tell him to expect you? Oh, I should be back before dark. Before dark. Okay, well, I'll be sure to let him know when I see him again. If you see him. Thanks, darling. You know, I know that Brewster wasn't very excited about this whole babysitter idea, but he really does need to learn to step up, especially on behalf of his little sister. Kimmy, I'm here! Ow! Oh, he's making effort. Good. I'm happy to hear that. Okay. Well, we'll see you later... Oh, you've already... You've already hung up on me. Okay, bye-bye. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Prepare to generate a black hole big enough to transport the entire ship back to Earth. Now that the artist formerly known as Agent Action is my prisoner, I will begin my invasion immediately, with the two of them as the first of my drone warriors. What happens next will change everything. Yes, your royal vileness. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the... Wait, what was I doing? Oh, bother. I forgot what I wasn't supposed to forget. Let's see, was it call my mother? No, no. I don't have one. Was it plug my head into the charger port? Oh, I know. It was something very important. Something right under my nose. Come on, Rattle. You can remember! You don't want Commander Kruel yelling at you again. Wait a minute, I know what it was. Hey, you! What are you looking at? Keep it moving. Oh, all... all right. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners Be careful! Must guard the prisoners. Got it! Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Must guard the prisoners. Huh? Hey, babysitter! What do you think you're doing? They're busting out of this rusty bucket. Hey, who said that? Who said that? Who are you? Me? Oh. I'm the big brother. And if you don't get your rusty butt away from my little sister. Me and my babysitter... are gonna shatter your Let's do this! Shut the front door. - Come on. - Get him, meat head! Uh, I'm a... Hi-yah! Way to go, Brewster! I'm here to rescue you guys. It's gonna be okay, but we've gotta move fast. Hi-yah! Huh, bingo! Hi-yah! Brewster, over here! Come on, come on, come on! Okay, how do we get this cage open? - You don't. - Kruel! I guess you missed the knock before entering sign. Whoa! Brewster Banner, is it? So you've come all this way to save your sister and your babysitter. How valiant. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Let's go, Kruel. But sadly, you'll be joining them both as one of my slaves. - Not even close. - Oh, and why's that? 'Cause anybody that knows me knows I have a serious issue with being bossed around, especially by you. That and the fact I'm about to kick your butt, dragon lips. - Brewster, look out! - Whoa! Leave my brother alone, you bad breath bully! Hi-yah! Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. Action blast. No! Nighty night, Commander Crud. - Yeah! - Yes! All right, let's get this party started. I'm gonna shut Kruel down. You two, run straight to the escape shuttle. System override. Go, go, go go! Go, go, go, go! He's got a wormhole opening up in six minutes. I need you to fire one of your USB pods toward the navigation deck. - It's a dead end! - It's okay. - We will find another way out. - Nice duds. Thanks. I one heck of a tailor. You got that right. Pick it up. Let's show these losers how we do things back on Earth. Easy peasy. Let's cannonball this. I see you found my intergalactic recording studio, which also doubles as my octagon of terror. It's over, Kruel! Get ready for the old rock 'em, sock 'em. Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Double A, let's get out of here. Action blast! You're going down! Hey! Now, that's what I call girl power! - No! - Bye, bye Kruel! It's a cruel, cruel world. Bye-bye! Just putting the last finishing touches in. Whoa! Let's get out of here. Double A? Brewster, is she all right? Get up, Double A, let's get out of here! We've lost contact. What about Brewster? Uh, we have lost connection to his frequency. Did you see that? You were right, these suits are tight! Hey, come on. Shake it off, Champ! Brewster? Double A? Come on, we gotta go. This is all my fault. Thanks for saving me. Hero. Oh. If I told you once, I told you a bazillion times. Call me Aunt Patty. Aunt Patty? Aunt Patty. Aunt Patty! Yeah, that's my name. Don't wear it out. Hey, either of your kids got an Aspirin? My head feels like a piÃ±ata. Come on, let's get out of here. My cat doesn't like it when I'm gone for too long. Oh, speaking of Mr. Fuzzy Pants, Ever tell you the time that he managed to order pizza to the house? Extra anchovies. Get ready for the old rock 'em, sock 'em! Oh! Come on, let's go! Brewster, get everyone in the shuttle, now! You'd better move. That ship is about to squished like a tin can. Yes! I've got control of the navigation deck. Everyone, buckle up! Oh! And then we have take off. Sit tight, while I send Kruel's ship to a place where he will never bother anyone ever again. Thanks, Big Earl. This babysitter is heading home. Speaking of, your famous meatloaf is in the oven as we speak. I'll send it to you. Have a safe flight! You're all heroes. Wh... wh... where am I going? Wait, no! Oh, my God, my beautiful ship! Not my beautiful ship! Hi! - Hi. - How were they? Perfect. They didn't need me at all. Well, what did you do while I was gone? We saved the world. Oh! Come on. Get in. Bye, you guys. - Bye. - Till next time. Remember... - Mum's the word. - Okay. Thank you so much. Oh... Okay, that I do not recognize. Down boy! Nice Doggy! And with that, all of these so-called UFO sightings simply came to an abrupt halt. It's now speculated that the entire incident was quite possibly a hoax, followed by mass hysteria. So far, we've heard no comment from Agent Action who, once again, has gone back into mysterious seclusion. One has to wonder if we will ever learn the true identity of what is undeniably the world's greatest superhero. Thank you, Agent Action for all you do. Shucks. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Aunt Patty, it's me, Brewster Brewster. Sorry. The heck are you dressed like that for? I thought you were one of Kruel's bozos. Oh, no, this is my costume for the talent show. Talent show? Wowzer. Uh, I bet you killed it. I bet you won. - Not exactly. - Oh... We got beat by a dancing poodle. Oh, well, poodles are pretty competitive. Yeah. I just wanted to stop by and, uh, say thank you. Oh, flowers! Uh, catnip for Mr. Fluffy Pants. - Oh. - For your cat, not Big Earl. Oh, yeah. Great. Well, thanks. No big whoop. All in a day's work. Besides, you're the one that saved us. I guess I'm not the only hero in town. Yeah. I think I'm just gonna stick to being a big brother for right now. Unless you need a super sidekick. I mean, that suit is so epic, and we could seriously kick some... Yeah, that... that... That's not happening. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think so. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for being so rude. I guess it's true what they say. You can't really judge a book by its cover. You did not just say that. I could barely get it out. Oh! What the heck, whoa! Brewster, stay back! Now what? Hokey smokes, we got big trouble! What the heck is that? Shut the front door. Bub? Look out! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Agent Action, activate!
