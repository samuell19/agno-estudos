HAPPY BIRTHDAY DRINKING WATER Mom? - Mom! - Yes, dear? - Where are the bike keys? - They are near the Buddha statue. - Brother? - Yes? Aren't you an MLA now? But your son is still rearing pigs. It is embarrassing. - Embarrassing? - Yes. - Do one thing for me. - Yes, brother. Buy him ten lions. We'll ask him to rear them! He's doing what he loves. Why are you bothered? Don't ever tell him what you told me. You won't have any gums left to flap. Ignore him, Brother. Our District Secretary Rathnavel is hosting another dog race it seems. What's your problem now? What's it to us if he hosts a dog race or a wolf walk? Let's mind our own business. We got plenty to do, man! Okay, Brother. Don't give up! Run! Keep going! Go! Go! Go! - Come on! - Come on! Damn it! You did well, kiddo! You won! How did our dog lose, Brother? Shut up! You fool... What are you saying? Seems like there's some huge problem... Master is here! Master's here. Hurry! Let's start! What happened? He hit me, Master. He hit you?! - Who? - Karthi hit me, Master. Why did he hit you? I accidentally stepped on him while practicing a form. - Did you apologize? - I did, Master. He hit me after that. He's a big shot now, is he? Alright. What do we do now? Please tell him not to hit me anymore, Master. You can tell him that yourself. If I do, he'll hit me again. Scared? Okay, run along. Nothing like that, Master. It's just that it won't sit right with you. You aren't afraid? Are you ready to hit him back then? Why are you hesitating? Because he's bigger than you? Look at me. It doesn't matter who wins. What matters is who's scared. If you give him three strong punches... he'll be afraid to even touch you. Got it? Shall we proceed? Yes, Master. Rathnavel, you claimed that your dog never loses a race. But it did! It lost. You say it like you don't care. What will you do with that loser dog? Give it to me. I'll have it stand guard for my orchard. What do you say? Don't keep hitting someone assuming that they won't hit back. That is depravity. Don't keep getting beaten up believing that you can't strike back. That is cowardice. - Got it? - I'm sorry, Master. I'm sorry, Master. SAMOOGANEEDHI CAMPAIGN - I told you to vacate a long time ago! - Yes... - But you haven't! - Stop repeating yourself. - Kids are studying out there. - Listen up! Stop arguing! - Just vacate it! - Try to understand, brother! What's wrong? There you are. So it's you who told them I can't do anything if you refuse to vacate. What you are doing is totally unfair, sir. How can you make us leave within four months after signing a three-year contract? We're not running a beauty salon here. We're educating children. They all are underprivileged children! Why don't you understand? Listen up. I don't care about all that. The only thing that matters to me is my and my family's safety. Who got you so spooked that you're throwing us out? At least tell us who they are! We'll deal with them ourselves! Don't ask me any more questions. Please understand. Just move out. - But why, sir... - Leela! The way he's panicking, I think this is bigger than what meets the eye. Someone's peeved with our free coaching center. Exactly! Who is that someone? Shouldn't we find out? Shouldn't we know who that scumbag is? He certainly won't tell us, Leela. Given the circumstances, what are we still doing here? We'll find another place for the kids. Hey! You make it sound like that's easy! Do you think we can find another place so soon? Do you know how long it'll take? How much it'll cost? Have you... Wait! Don't worry about the cost. I'll cover it. I'll give you how much ever you want. I don't want to incur the curse of these poor kids. Sir... we can handle our problems. Please leave. You want us to vacate, right? - We'll do it. - No, dear. Keep it. No need, sir. Please leave. What now? He only told us to move out. Why the long faces? We were going to do it someday. Leela, let's go check with Athiveeran. Check with him about what? - Will you plead before his father? - Leela! Why do you sound so hostile? He's also our friend, isn't he? He's helped us a lot! What's the harm in talking to him? In that case, you all go talk to him. I'll handle the rest of the work. Stop seeing him just as an MLA's son, Leela. Has he ever rubbed that in? He's the reason why we are supporting you today. He talks so highly of you. Don't you know? Try to understand. Stop beating that drum of him being an MLA's son. A lot of time has passed since college! Yet, you go on like a broken record! A jungle filled with wild jasmines A jungle of flowers That held me in its spell Those flowers I wore have withered That is the woe of my fate Cold, northern winds beckon me I can't step across the threshold Cold, northern winds beckon me I can't step across the threshold What shall I do?

What's with him? He took down his father's party flag! He's just showing off. Why would he do that? He likes me. He keeps gawking at me. - Hey! - What? Why are you staring at Leela like that? Because I like her. What about it? And then what? Well... he goes about his business and I go about mine. That's all. So, you check him out too? Indeed, I do. Even I like him. Then why don't you go talk to her? And say what? She doesn't even respect me as a classmate. She only sees me as the MLA's son. His father's sense of entitlement runs in him, as well. If I went up to her, she'd take it as arrogance. He's not my type. Why dwell on him now? Give me some water. Very well. A man has learned everything He knows how to run his life But there was this one thing That he failed to grasp Like a sweet-throated cuckoo He knows to create beautiful music Like a pair of powerful ox He knows to pull heavy a load Like birds in the wilderness He knows to soar high above the skies But he does not know How to live a human life - Brother? - Yes? - Veeran's friends want to meet you. - Alright. - I'm coming. - Yes, Brother. - Welcome! - Greetings, sir. Greetings. Please sit down. - Please sit. - It's okay, sir. Please sit down, dear boy! Always be seated while talking to someone. Okay, sir. - Don't remain standing. Got it? - Yes, sir. How can I help you, son? We're Athiveeran's friends from college. We came to see him. - Oh, you're here to see him? - Yes, sir. He must be here somewhere. I'll get his mother. Care to meet her? - Okay, sir. - That will do, sir. - Would you like something to drink? - That's okay. Okay. All of you have come together. Is something wrong? - Nothing like that, sir! - No, sir! - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. - I'll go and get her. - Yes, sir. Please stay seated! Didn't I just tell you? Sit down! - I'll get her. - Yes, sir. Veerayi! Dear? - Veerayi? - Yes, dear? Some of Athiveeran's friends are here to see him. Dear! The one in the middle. Don't you know who she is? Who is she, dear? Athiveeran has her picture in his book! - Oh, so she's the one? - Yes. Alright, you go and talk to them. You go on. I got this. Welcome! - You all are Athiveeran's friends? - Yes, ma'am. - Are you all doing well? - Yes. - Do you want to see Athiveeran? - Yes. He's always at the pigpen out back! I think he might be there right now, as well. - Would you like to go there and chat? - Sure. - I'll get you all some beverages. Go. - Alright. My dear! What's your name? - Leela. - Come with me, dear. Come on, help me with the beverages. Come, dear. - Go. - Please feel at home. You dress like a man and yet you're so shy. You've come here for the first time. I have so much to ask. You and Athiveeran are close friends, right? Is he pleasant and friendly with you, at least? Why are you quiet, dear? Your family will agree, won't they? Agree to what? I don't understand. What do you mean? You and Athiveeran love each other, right? Oh, no! Nothing like that, Auntie. We were classmates in college. Besides that, I've never spoken to him. What are you saying, dear? He hasn't spoken to you at all? - No, Auntie. - Good lord! So he treats you the same way he treats his father? That boy is fond of him. Yet, he won't say a word to him. What shall I do with him? Auntie? Athiveeran and his father don't speak to each other? It's been fifteen years since they spoke, dear. Fifteen years? Why? What happened? That's a long story, dear. Only me and my God Pottipagadai know about it. POTTI PAGADAIAPPAN - Hey, the water... - Hey, come here. Hey, come on! What are you doing here, brother? Can't you see? We're playing cards. Come join us. Why are you so worked up? You continue playing cards here while pig herds bathe in the temple well! How did they get in there? - They're making this a habit... - Why do they always do this?! We have to teach them a lesson. Why are they doing this? - Come on! - Let's go! Last week, we explicitly forbade them from going to the well! You should've punished them the last time they did it, but you didn't! Now they won't stop doing it! - Don't hit me. - No. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. No! Oh, God! Don't hit me. Dad! M.SUNDARAM. B.A. FORMER MINISTER - Come. - Greetings, brother. - Sir? - Brother? - Mannu is here. - Sir? - Come, Mannu. - Greetings, sir. - Did you hear about it, sir? - Yes. - We live together as brethren. - Be calm. - Yet they committed such an atrocious act. - I got this. - Our town is beyond devastated. - Come. I'll sort it out. - We don't know what to do! - Come along. Why did you stop here, sir? Listen, Mannu. It's a huge problem. It's getting out of our hands. Let's talk it out first and make a decision. What is there to decide, sir? What is... Let's go, sir. My heart breaks when I think about what they did. Those monsters pelted innocent kids to death! We can't stay mum about this anymore, sir. - The people are raging! - Mannu... Please tell me what to do. - I'm ready for anything. - Hey, go and stand there! - Wait there! We're talking here! - Okay, sir. Nothing like that, Mannu... We're ready for everything. - Tell me what you want. - What can I say, sir? Four thugs in a murderous rage have pelted innocent kids to death. Back home, my son is battling for his life. We cannot let them get away, sir. They must be hanged to death! They must be hanged! Sir... my son and I will come to testify anywhere you want, sir. Hearing you speak like this is taking a toll on my heart, man! A major political party. Many great leaders. No matter how many speeches are given against this... ...these rabid brutes never change. I am ashamed! I am so bloody ashamed, Mannu! - Kandasamy? - Brother? Did you find out what's going on there? I called to check. Things are pretty rough. They've assembled the entire village! If we go with the police and try making arrests... ...they're ready to riot. - We must think this through. - What, brother! Why is the whole village united in support of those murderous beasts? Please be fair! Let's assume, I were to have the police pursue them for you... the whole village will see it as a dishonor. What do I do? How, sir? How can the murderous rage of four become an issue of honor for 400 families? - I don't understand! - I don't understand it either! Moreover, it goes against what our party stands for. We came to power in order to root out such evil. And we're fighting to regain that power. What if we act on your word and the opposition takes advantage of it? - What will you do? - Sir... You're saying all kinds of things. I'm confused. But there's one thing I'm sure of... my village and my people trust me and the party. This is all that I can do. Why keep repeating yourself when he's made things clear? You keep telling us to take action. But how do we do that? We have no power or authority. Quit going on and on. Yes, Mannu. More than getting revenge, it's important we protect those forty families. To do that, you must rise to a prominent position in the party. If he acted on your word, and they retaliated against you... how will he tolerate it? Don't just stand there. Make a decision. - Alright. - Mannu... I'll be back. Okay. Go on. We're all with you, Mannu! Talk to me, dear boy! Tell your father! Tell your father, my boy! Where did you go? Where did you go to bathe? Where the hell did you go bathe? Tell me! Tell me, son! Tell me, Athiveera! Where did you go bathe? Tell me, dear boy! Tell me, my son! Where did you go? Please tell your father, my dear! Tell me, my boy! Where did you go? Don't cry! Tell your father! He'll take care of it! Tell your father! Tell me who hit you! Tell me! Tell your father who hit you! Who hit you, my dear? - Kandasamy... - Brother? - Did we say anything wrong? - Not at all! We're trying to keep things under control. True. If they turn it into a reserved constituency, Mannu is our only man. We need him to seek their votes. What are you saying? Will they make it a reserved con... That's what we are thinking. I don't know what's going on in his head. THE WALL ON THE WELL COLLAPSED AND THE SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE KILLED Like the hard-working crows He toils for the rest of humanity He urges young children To treat each other as brethren He leads his life in accordance With the values of Thirukural He assures the poor and needy That tomorrow is theirs to reap He assures the poor and needy That tomorrow is theirs to reap Look at me, dear. Why are you crying? Our son lying here as a bloody heap is evidence of this horror. We can't do anything about it. Let it go, dear. It's our fate. Fate! Is that what you think it is? When he wakes up tomorrow and asks for his friends, what do I say? When the downtrodden do not have the right to get angry or indignant... what can either of us do?

You can use my martial arts dojo until you find some other place. I can train my students outdoors. Hey... thanks. - No problem. - Give me your hand. What's this now? Just give it to me. I'll explain. - Will this do? - Yes. Sorry. - For what? - I knew nothing about you. Yet, I stayed away, assuming I knew everything. For that. Then, I'm sorry too. What are you apologizing for? I knew everything about you. Yet, I stayed away, pretending I didn't. For that.

Are you running that center? Yes, I run the place. Who are you? We told you to shut it down, but you won't, yes? You're scared to even tell me your name and you're threatening me? If you have the guts, come meet me! - Who do you think you are talking to? - Why I ought to... - Hello? - It was about the center. - He hung up? - Yes. - Who is he? - I don't know. They call from unknown numbers and threaten us. They demand that we shut down the center. Okay. Don't get worked up. We'll handle it.

How much did they pay you for the video? Fifty thousand... Yes? Fifty thousand, brother. Fifty thousand. If you had asked me, I would've given it to you! - Brother... - Get lost! - Hold it, kid! - Brother... - Hey Vardha, stop! - Brother... Brother... - Get lost! - Brother... Brother... Please forgive me, brother. I didn't mean to do it. Pardon? - You didn't mean to do it? - Yes. Brother... - You don't know? - Brother... I should have raised you on a leash along with the dogs. - Brother. - I set you free. - And you ventured out? - Brother... - Will you do that again? - No! - Will you? - No, brother! - Will you roam around again? - I won't, brother! - Will you? - I won't! - Will you? - I won't, brother! - Will you? - I won't, brother! - Please, brother... - Go inside. - I said, go inside! - I won't roam around again! - Damn mongrel! You'll shoot videos? - Brother! - Get lost! - Brother! No, brother! I won't do it again! I won't do this again! - Please, brother! - Brother! - That's enough! - I won't do it again! That's enough, brother! He might die! I won't do it again... I won't do it again... He was this small when he came here! I have fed this dog ever since! What made him bite the hand that fed him? Yes? I won't do it again... Hey! Tell everyone I want obedience in my men. Don't burden yourselves by thinking too hard! I won't do it again... Take him to the hospital. Despite having its heart ripped out... see how that hog runs into the wild, dragging along its body. Armed with spears, we chase. It plucks a dusky hibiscus and plants it where its heart was... and runs even faster. "Ever since I told her this story, my woman wears a red hibiscus every day." "Rust spreads and abounds on that blood-stained spear." "The rain seems to not cease." Veera! Why do you like those piglets so much? What kind of question is that? I just do. Do you know... about my first ever dream that I remember? It's this one right here. A piglet flying high up in the air. I used to wonder... if the piglets here sprouted wings, wouldn't that be the end of all troubles? But so far, that hasn't happened. Hello? Brother? What is it? We're here, brother. The light is on upstairs. Looks like they are studying. So what if they're studying? I don't understand. Hey! Just follow my orders! Go! Yes, brother. Here. Get that club. MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL - Who are you all? - Get lost! - Oh, no! - Thrash him! - Get out! Leave! - Who are you? Why must we leave? I said, get out! Everyone, get out! Tear the place down! Hey! Who are you all?! Smash everything! Run! Run away! Run! Who are you all? What do you want? Don't do this! Stop! Please don't destroy it! Don't destroy it! Please stop! Please stop! Stop wrecking this place! - Tear it up! - Stop it! Why are you doing this? Do not destroy that! Do not destroy Master's portrait! Who are you all? - Why are you doing this? - Break every single thing! Veera! - Where are you? - Let's go! Veera! Athiveera! Dear boy! Look at this! Look at this atrocity! Athiveera! He's not answering! The number you're trying to call is not answering... Call the girl. Leela. ...you're calling is unreachable. She's not picking up, either. Let's go to the martial arts dojo and check it out ourselves. Come on! Come on! Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Are you here, son? - Who did this? - I don't know, son! I don't know! - Who was it? - I don't know. Around ten men showed up, son. Grandpa... They beat up all the kids! They wrecked the portrait of Master! I can't bear it, son! I can't bear it! I can't bear it, son... Take him to the hospital. The boys said that the men were from Sundaram Academy. They're the ones who forced us to vacate. Hey! Go there! Hey! Who are you guys? What are you doing... - What are you up to? - Sit down. Nothing will happen to you! Do you know for sure? - Are you sure? - I am sure, brother. Sure? Did you not expect them to strike back after we beat them up? Instead of coming here, where were you all last night? Morons! No, brother... I didn't expect them to do this. Quit beating around the bush! Where were you all? The guys wanted to stop and get a bite to eat on the way back, brother. So we stopped and had some food. By the time we came here... they tore the place apart, brother. When I checked with both watchmen, I got to know that around twenty kids showed up. It was those kids who did it. - Hello, sir. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. Ask everyone to leave. Leave now! - What the hell did you do? - I didn't do anything. Around twenty college kids broke in and tore the place apart. We found out who they are. There's no problem. We'll handle it. What do you mean? College boys? What did you do? I already said I didn't do anything! Don't you lie to me! Spare me your tales! You beat up those students! Are you senseless? Look at me. Why did you do it? What's wrong with what I did? You know how admissions are down from last year's! And why is that? Because she offers free tutoring! It was okay if it was only for the downtrodden kids. But now if affluent kids flock there, where does that leave me? Screw you! Here I'm dreaming of riding on an elephant and you go on about riding a donkey! Moron! Did we ask you to mint money from this center and bring it home to us? And you dare to lecture me about business! You idiot! Why are you yelling? I'm your elder brother. I can handle my problems. You mind your own business. Pardon? I should mind my own business, yes? One more word and I'll forget that you're my brother. I'll feed you to my dogs! Get lost! You mess up and then you've the audacity to tell me to mind my own business! Remember the struggle we went through to arrive at this position and power? And you're shooting your mouth off? So many people were waiting to ruin our family after our father died. I beat them all to reach where I am. And here you go around talking rubbish! They are waiting for me to stumble so they can take my place! And you go around and beat up students... Are you handing me to them on a platter? Whatever you choose to do, make sure you do it right. If not, don't do it at all! We must not let anything slip out of our hands. Fine, I made a mistake. What do I do now? - Who were those kids? - All college students. MLA Maamannan's son was among them. - Our MLA Maamannan's son? - Yes. Are you an idiot? If he is one of us, you could've easily sorted it out! Why blow it up? - Mohan! - Brother? - Come here! - Be right there! Yes, brother? - Ask the police to leave. - Okay. - There shouldn't be any news about this. - Got it. Have MLA Maamannan come by the house. - Yes, brother. - Tell him to bring his son. - Yes, brother. - Go. Hey! It's all sorted. Tell everyone to leave! Okay, brother. No, thanks. Light it up, brother. MOM - Yes, Mom? - Your father wants to talk to you, dear. Don't waste your time, Mom. Hang up! Please don't say that, dear. Hang up, Mom! Dear son... My boy... My dear... You don't have to talk. Please just hear me out. When I was only a low-level worker back in the day... I couldn't do what you wanted. But today, I'm an MLA. I believe that now I can. If you also believe that I can, then please come over right away. Let's talk and sort it out. If you don't want to, that's fine. I shall go by myself, dear. I shall go by myself. See how they destroyed the place, son. Wow! Your son is all grown-up! Why haven't you introduced him to me before? What's his name, brother? Athiveeran. Athiveeran! Sit down, dear boy. Let's talk. He never introduced us to this young man! Dad. You sit. You sit, Son. He asked you to sit. Go ahead. Sit down, Veera. You sit, Dad! Sit down, Son. Sit down, Veera. - Your father never sits down, my boy. - Sit. It has always been like this. You sit. Dad... Sit. Come on. I've known him for ages, my boy. No matter who says, he won't sit. You go ahead. No matter who says, he won't sit? That's what I said. I've seen him for years. No matter who says, he won't sit in our house. Did you ask him to? What? I meant, did you ever ask him to sit? - What the hell? - You dare to be insolent! He is kind enough to tell you to sit. Sit, damn it! - Why are you being rude? - Hey, stop! Can't you be quiet? Get lost. We'll discuss that later. First, sit down. Sit down, my boy. - I said, sit down! - Hey! How dare you put your hands on him?! Hey! Dad! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Hey! Back off! Brother! - Brother! - Hey! - Brother! - Veera! Son! Son! - Veera, my boy! - Get up, brother! - Don't do it, Veera! - Come on, guys! Don't do it, Son! Son! Please don't, Veera! Listen to me, son. Veera! Veera! Please listen to me, son! - Don't do it! - Let go, Dad! - Stay calm, Son! - Dad, let go of me! - Let go of me, Dad! - Listen to me! Listen to me! Don't do this! Athiveera! Don't do this! Listen to your father! - Move aside, Dad! - Veera! Veera! Oh, no! - Why do this, Veera? - Dad... - sit! - We'll get into immense trouble! - Sit, Dad! - No, Son. Let's leave! - I told you to sit, Dad! - Let's go! Why wallow in fear all the time? - Sit down, Dad! - Veera... - What are you doing? - Sit down! - I said, sit down! - Son, what are you doing? Hey! My dear! Don't you ever get up! - Hey! - Don't just stand there. guys! Get him! Whack him! Sit down, Dad! Why are you getting up? No matter what, don't get up! Sit down! Hey! Grab him! - Hold him tightly, guys! - Hey! - Dad! - Hold him tightly! Don't get up, Dad! No matter what, don't get up! - Won't you get up, brother? - Dad! - Dad... - I'm talking to you, brother. Don't get up, Dad! - Won't you get up? - No matter what he says, don't get up! Come here and restrain him, you idiot! Shut up! Hey! Dad! Hey! Let go of me! Let go! Dad! Velu... Velu... Please don't do it. You're making a mistake. You're making a mistake, man. Dad... - What mistake, brother? - Hey! - Yes? - Hey! What mistake? You sat because your son asked you to, right? Listen... son... Hey! I had so much respect for you. Hey! How could you do such a thing? - Let him go! - Look at this! You sat down and disrespected me. Don't do it, man! What new habit is this? What new habit is this? What new habit is this? - What new pathetic habit is this? - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! What are you yelling for? To have your father stand is part of my identity! Asking you to sit... that's my politics! Pig-herding mongrel! You thought you could change it all in a day? Were you trying to destroy old practices? Bloody beggar! Hey! Tie them both up at my father's shrine! Go! - Go tie them up! - Get the ropes! I'll blow both of their brains out! I'll bury them both right here! What are you doing? Hold him tightly! Hey! Jyothi! Open the door, Jyothi! What are you doing, Jyothi? Open the door! I said, open the door! Jyothi! Hey, Kalidurai! Where are you? Hey! Hey! Where the hell are you, Jyothi? Open this damn door! Come, Veera! Don't, dear. Let's go, Veera! - Let go, Dad! - Don't! - Let's go, Veera! - Hey! - Don't do it, Son! - Hey! - Wait, dear. - Mom! Open the door, Mom! Jyothi! - How dare you touch him? - Let it be, dear. Look at your father! Look at me! Look at my face! - Let go of me, Dad! - Hey, listen to me! - Hey! Open the door, guys! - Listen to me, Veera. - Don't go there, Veera! - Hey! - Look at me. - Come on! - Look at me! - Get out of here! - Look at me, Veera! - Move aside, Dad! - Look at me, Son! - Hey! - Look at me! - Dad! - Just hear me out! - Let go of me, Dad! Jyothi! - Look at me, Veera! Don't do this! - Jyothi! I'm unarmed. I won't do anything to them. Please open the door, Jyothi! - Come out if you have the guts! - Open the door, Jyothi! Jyothi! - Come out! - Will you listen to me or not? Will you listen to your father or not, Athiveera? Please listen to me. Don't do this. It'll cause a lot of trouble! I'm speaking to you after a long time. At least now, please do as I say. Listen to me now! Don't do it, Veera. Enough is enough. Whatever it is, let's talk about it. Come on, son. Let's go, Veera. M. SUNDARAM, B.A., SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM Veerayi? Veerayi? It's okay. I'm here, right? I'll handle it. What happened? My dear... don't ask him anything. He is not the one to be blamed. I believed that the little authority I had... was not what I deserved. It was some charity bestowed upon me. I have spent my whole life standing before those who were seated. That is my fault. My greatest fault. And I demeaned myself in front of my son as well. That was my biggest mistake. But my son? Be it then or now... he has never done anything wrong. Never! It's me. It's... It's all my fault! Hello? Dad? Who was it? It's nothing, son. Please take her inside, dear. Please go inside. Veerayi... it's nothing. I'm here, aren't I? Go. You trust me, don't you? Get up. Go in. It's nothing. Be brave. - Please go. - We'll handle it. Lock the door once you're in, dear. Just to be safe. Who was it, Dad? Who else? Rathnavel has sent his goons over to start another ruckus. They're on their way. Son? What? You have a call from the Chief Minister. - Don't answer it. - But... I already have. He's on the line. Talk to him. Everyone, head that side. Go on! Go! - Hello? - Hello? Greetings, Chief. How are you? What is this, Velu? You won't pick up when I call? Nothing like that, Chief. I was in the shower. You hung up before I could pick up. Listen up. I know about everything that's going on there. With the election looming, what is this mess? Please don't say that, Chief. I don't know what they told you. What we have here is not a party issue. It's personal. A dog that I had raised... on my doorstep, has dared to bite me. I must kill it. It's a minor issue, Chief. Please stay out of it. Listen up, Velu. I'm the Chief Minister. Do you hear me? No matter what, stop whatever it is that you're doing... and come here right now. We need to discuss this in person. Got it? If you choose to do anything reckless instead... then you're doomed. Understood? The CM has a lot to tend to. I'm hanging up. Wait! Hold on, Veera! Hold on. Son! Wait! Veera! Hold on! Don't go out there! - Do not go out there! - Dad... - Head inside. - Listen to me. - No, you listen to me. Go in. - Listen to your father. - Go to mom! - Come! - Come, Son. Don't go out. I got this. - Dad... - They're here! - Let them come! - What are you doing? - Just come! Sit! Sit down. They're here, Dad! Listen to your father. Sit down. Dad, I said, they're here! Hey! I said I'll handle it, didn't I? Won't you listen? Won't you obey your father? Sit down! Sit! Sit down. Listen to me. Until I come back, don't step out. Obey your father. If you do... Take this. What is this, Dad? How did you... Your mentor gave them to me. He wanted you to have them if what happened to you before was repeated. Take it. Son... not a single man who comes in here intending to kill us... gets to walk out alive. Understood? Sit down, Son. We'll see who dares to come in here. Brother? - Where are you all? - We're here, brother. The house is locked. I think they're inside. We'll go in and finish them. Don't go in. Until I order you to, stay put. Back out. Go. Go. - Brother? - Hey... Tell me, brother. I'll send my dogs over. They raise pigs, don't they? Yes. Leave the dogs in the pigpen. They're on the way? Shall I let them loose in there? You know what I mean. At least four or five must die today. Yes, brother. - Go! - Go on! - Go in there! - In there! Dad? Can you hear the pigs squealing? No, Son. I can't hear anything. Son? Dad... I can hear it. Are they hurting the pigs? Why would they harm the pigs? Impossible. Something's fishy, Dad. I can hear it. - I'll go check. - Veera! It can't be, Son. Whoever it may be, let them come in, Veera. Listen to me, Veera! Why did a venomous viper Slide onto the roof of my head? Why did that slithering snake Make its home on my mind's bed? Why did a venomous viper Slide onto the roof of my head? Why did that slithering snake Make its home on my mind's bed? Beneath the teeth What could be that thundering din? Amidst the roar How did the speeding spear pierce in? How did the speeding spear pierce in? In the breathless nasal space Why does the blood stench sprawl? What is the point of it all? Why did a venomous viper Slide into the roof of my head? Why did that slithering snake Make its home on my mind's bed? Beneath the teeth What could be that thundering din? Amidst the roar How did the speeding spear pierce in? How did the speeding spear pierce in? In the breathless nasal space Why does blood stench sprawl? What is the point of it all? What is the point of it all? I see... So your problem is that the son did not sit when you told him to. But you don't mind keeping his father standing in front of your lot at all times. SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM I understand now. It's not your fault. Your father is the one to be blamed! And your grandfather too! They scoured town after town to find grassroot workers! Glorified menial laborers! But they did not respect the party's creed! Not even a little bit! If they had, you wouldn't have sprouted like a thorn. Especially in these times! Listen. What's done is done. But I will not allow such a thing to happen again. If this ever gets out... it will be the biggest embarrassment for the party. So... apologize to that respected man Maamannan and put an end to this. Only then... you will at least be allowed to retain your membership in the party. Got it? Chief? I don't need your generous charity. I'm Salem Sundaram's son first. And only after that am I the District Secretary of your party. If retaining the position means dishonoring my father's pride... then I don't need such a position. I don't need it. If not this party... then another one. As you know, I can just as easily get the same position and respect elsewhere. And you very well know, how. It's not like you were unaware of the kind of clout I yield... when you gave me such a powerful position. Am I right? Rathnavel... you may leave. I don't want to lay my eyes on you again. Get going! Yes, Chief. I will leave. You aren't going to arrest me, are you? For all the old cases pending against me? - Yes? - Oh, shut up! You chump! You are too insignificant to be arrested! Go to whatever party you want! You can't do squat! Listen up! As of today, your era comes to an end in your district. Go! Thank you, Chief. If I was offensive, forgive me. I said, leave! Son! - Veera! Don't! - Sir! Sir! Son! Veera! Oh, no! Athiveera! I told this to your father when I first met him. "At some point in his life, your son will have to go to war." It has come true today. As a mentor, I would like to say this. In a war, there should be no hatred. You must fight to win with honor. Only then, will your life have any meaning. I think you understand. You can go in, sir. Not you, sir! You go in, sir. Sir, what's the Chief... Stay here, son. I'll go and have a word with him. Sir! - You can't go in! - My father's in there! - I must see him. I'm MLA Maamannan's son! - You weren't called in. - Please listen! - You listen! Please listen, sir! Sir! You can't go in there, sir! What is this? What's wrong? What's wrong? What are you doing? Chief... he's my son. Oh. You were afraid that I will make him stand, weren't you? Look. Wait outside, son. I'll call you once I'm done talking to him. I tried reasoning with him. His mind is full of wild thorns. We can never reform him. He might already be negotiating with another party. That rascal! So... Tell me what I must do. What shall I say, Chief? At least now you know the whole truth. That is enough for me. No one should ever have to go through what we did. That is all I want. We must start over. Can I make a request to you, Maamanna? By not seeking anyone's favor, only on the strength of our party and its symbol... you must contest the election again and make him watch you win. He's delusional. He claims his good fortune is responsible for all your victories! We must shatter that belief and knock him down a bit. Is that okay? Sir... it doesn't matter if I contest the election or not. What's more important is that my son decides if I must even stay in the party. Don't misunderstand me, sir. Because... my life and politics have caused him a great deal of pain. Whatever he chooses for me... I believe that it will be the right path. This will be my atonement to him. Fair enough. I will have to apologize to your son, as well. I shall talk to him. Send him in. Alright? Yes, sir. And Maamanna... Sir? Don't be afraid. I'm with you. I'll still say that Rathnavel is ruthless. Compared to his father... he's an even more pathetic fool. So... Be vigilant. Alright? Yes, sir. Sir... I'm not the same Mannu molded by Rathnavel's father. I am Maamannan, who was transformed by his son. I'll handle it, sir. I'll handle it. Dad? Sing a song. What's that, my son? Sing a song, Dad. A millennium may pass But our patience will surely bear fruit A millennium may pass But our patience will surely bear fruit Son! Watch out, son! Dad! Dad! - Are you hurt, Dad? - I'm fine. Are you alright? Sir! Nobody's hurt, right? - No. - Who did that... Hey, brother! Greetings! How are you? Why are you driving rashly? Were you scared? I did this. I didn't want you to stop being afraid of me after the CM's rousing speech! That's why. Brother. Why do you look so shocked? I don't pretend to be a savior of castes and creeds. Like my father, I only want to build my legacy for my children to inherit. That's all. It only works if we keep you oppressed through generations. I came here to bury you six feet under! But when the high priest of social justice decided to sermonize me... that's when I decided... that I will destroy your social justice. And then kill you both. Got it? That's all! You swore to win in the election without our support. Hey... Get out. Are you deaf? Get out of the car. Hold your horses. Your father may have joined the party after being inspired by the leaders' lofty speeches. But, I? I grew up admiring my father. It was his arrogance that drew me to the party. Whichever party I choose to join, that is my party. There isn't a damn thing anyone can do to me. I'll wipe you out in the next election. You and your damn leader! I'll drill it in your heads that your social justice is just a charity from me. And then... I'll beat you to death as if you were dogs. Got it? I'll beat you to death just like they beat dogs. Ever seen it happen? Hey! Shut your mouth. I'll beat you to death just like... I said, shut up! Why won't you just shut up? You know, I cared for you when you were a child. I even saved your life once when you almost choked to death on a coin. You had the gall to have your hounds slaughter our pigs. Who do you think we are? Dad. Let him go. You heard what he said. He'll face us in the elections. We'll show him who we are. Hey! Get lost! Superb, brother. Superb. Seems like you're prepared for anything. Indeed, we will see. We will. Now scoot! Go! My dear? I've been meaning to ask you. What did the chief say that made you agree to my contesting the election? I'll tell you when the time comes. - Dad? - What? Tell me the truth. Did my mentor give you the gun? No, Son. I bought it. Because I knew that unlike me, you wouldn't bow to anyone. So I bought it because you might have needed it. You won't need it anymore. You can defeat them without it. The thunderous rumble Do you hear me roar? The thunderous rumble Do you hear me roar? MARUMALARCHI SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM MARUMALARCHI SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM A mighty boom blares within Unfolds before me as an unseen trail I cast away the past Do you hear me roar? A mighty boom blares within Unfolds before me as an unseen trail I cast away the past Do you hear me roar? The thunderous rumble Do you hear me roar? The thunderous rumble The chirp of the crickets Ushers the noises of the night The crack of the dawn Heralds the sounds of the day The call of the bird Is the song of the sky The beat of the drum Is the anthem of life The thunderous rumble Do you hear me roar? It doesn't matter if my wife loses in Salem. My honor and respect lie in Madhan's victory at Kasipuram and Maamannan's defeat. Ensure that they work accordingly, brother. - Sit down, Madhan. - I'm good, sir. Sit down. Pull up a chair. - Don't be afraid. - Yes, brother. I'll make sure you win. Begone, bygone notions Welcome, brand-new dreams The Earth trembles as my great king Steps up to reign supreme Let traitors be disclosed Let deceivers be punished Let the battle begin Eyes ablaze, sparks make a haze Dusky hands unite To reach your dream, To open up doors, to be born again What makes things happen I know now, my path unfolds To make my voice soar Maamannan will be beside me forevermore -O Manna -O Manna -Maamanna -Maamanna -O Manna -O Manna -Maamanna -Maamanna -O Manna -O Manna -Maamanna -Maamanna -O Manna -O Manna -Maamanna -Maamanna A mighty boom blares within Unfolds before me as an unseen trail I cast away the past Do you hear me roar? More than ensuring our victory... we need to start a few fires like these in such reservation-based constituencies. If we present twenty of them, all neatly dressed... and shove some cash into their hands... they'll dance to our tunes. If we twist them a little more, they'll even do an ugly dance. That's what we need. - Got it? - Alright. But why make these guys contest? Can't we just buy them off? That option... may have sufficed in the past. But it won't work today. To compete in the race, they need our permission. But it must be carried out like our dog races. The winning dog will meet our needs. The losing dog meets its end. That's all. Doesn't matter if they split the vote by a hundred. They'll alienate the neighbors. That's what we want. Very well. But why is it only restricted to Kasipuram? Your wife is contesting in Salem. Let's focus on that, as well. Doesn't matter if she wins or loses! We must beat Maamannan. Let's focus on that. Brother! Hey, Maamannan! Forgot the past? Uncle... Quiet, dear. We're talking here. The boss is here... - Uncle! - and you dare to sit before him? - Won't you stand up? - Listen to me, uncle! Relax, dear. You're out of your depth here! - Get up! - Uncle... Uncle... I said, get up! - You're drunk and you're making a scene! - Hey, Kali! Hey! - Can't you bloody listen? - You keep fighting wherever you go! - Go! - Why are you hitting me? Get him out of here, Dad! - Quit blabbering! - Can't you listen? - Quit yelling! - Tell him to stand up! He's become so arrogant! - Quit making a scene, Kali! - He dares sit before the Chief! - Get lost! - Mannu! Why are you standing up, sir? - Kali! - Don't leave, sir! How many times do I tell you? Be quiet! We made a big mistake by not keeping them in line! - Go! - You don't know! Stand up, Mannu! Who is that girl? - Late Murthy's niece. - Oh. It was her center that we trashed. - You trashed her center? - Yes. You've made quite a mess by wrecking a relative's property! Now do you get why I call you a moron? But... How did the father and son show up here? She's friends with the MLA's son. Listen up. The father-son duo should not set foot in parts of our town, where our people live. Alright. But we don't get to decide that. Only the caste association can. - The caste association? - Yes. Bring them over. We'll talk. Sure. I'll call them. Brother... your father was on good terms with our caste association. But you are not like him. You ignored us even when you were in a higher position in the ruling party. So, the association members do not respect or trust you. In fact, all the townsfolk are really mad at you. So... we'll need to talk it over with everyone and... You're saying this despite being on my side? Nothing of that sort... Alright. I'm in the wrong. What do I do now? No big deal. They seek a proper apology. So... Just an apology? No problem. Please forgive me. Well... Not like that. They want you to fall at their feet and apologize. Hey! Fall at their feet? Who should fall at whose feet? - Brother... - Shanmugavel. Sit down. Brother... it's not just you. No matter who it is, this is our tradition. Please don't take it the wrong way. This was decided by the association... not by me... I'll be right back. Please sit. Rathnavel! Hear your father out. It is okay if you lose to those above you or your peers... but never ever lose to those who are beneath you. It's akin to death. Got it? That'll do, brother. - Rathnavel... - That'll do. This will suffice. Rathnavel? Don't be afraid. We are with you. We will win! Maamannan won't be able to set foot in here! We'll see to it! What's wrong? Can't you see? There's a death in the village. No one can come. Everyone leave! We'll go pay our respects then. Did they invite you to pay your respects? Leave! - Go! Leave! - Brother... Nobody should enter! Leave! Go! - Why are you talking like that? - How else do we say it? I beg of you, kind sir. Please leave! Tell them to leave! Don't just stand there! Leave! - They're ensuing chaos. Let's go. - Go! Keep going! You'll face the same thing in every town! Keep going! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! We're boycotting the election. You're not welcome here. Leave! I can't believe you're saying that, Ramasamy! Those are things of the past. You're not welcome anymore! Go! MAYHEM IN SALEM, KASIPURAM MAAMANNAN VS MADANKUMAR A ritual is in progress the temple! Outsiders aren't allowed to enter the village during the ritual. - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! Listen, Maamannan! You won't be able to enter any village! You won't be able to walk on any street! We'll keep you away from every village and show you who we are! Veera... what's wrong? What's wrong? The man has served as an MLA for ten years! He has been with them through all their ups and downs. But now? One man... At one man's behest... the whole village turned up to protect his honor. I don't get it, Leela. How can one person's rage transform into the pride of thousands? One man's perceived honor is supposedly jeopardized... and hundreds stand up for him within seconds! How is that possible? You don't get it, do you? What's even worse is that... a fellow party worker sneaks out to join their crowd. I don't know how to fight this. Listen, Veera. Look at me. What are you saying? You accuse other people. What about your own kin? Twenty of them got paid to run against your father. Two of them are your father's closest confidantes! Everyone here knows everything! What do you say to that? If you try to figure out if money, caste, or religion drives them... you'll only go insane! All of it is being used against us! Understand that! They're all used against us, right? What can one even do about it? We can only make all kinds of excuses! - Son? - What is it, Dad? Come out here and see. Come! What's this, sir? You have invited us for meals, for studies and all the other good things. But you venture out alone to fight? Why are you glaring at her, sir? We are not little kids to be told what to do. I'm glad you all have come. But this is my problem. I want to keep you students, out of it. All of you, leave. Do you think this is just your problem, sir? Didn't you come to our homes seeking our votes? How then can it be just your problem? If someone forbids you from coming to my house, I have a right to question it! And I will question it! Whether you invite me or not, I will show up! I will question them, sir! Let's go to my home! Alright. I'll come. I definitely will. But for now, all of you please leave If you stand with me now... you will be going against your families. How can you treat us as simpletons just like they do, sir? We're old enough to vote! We have the right to decide who to welcome into our home! More than that... they're forcing the antiquated creed of their caste upon us, sir! Don't assume that only you have the right to be angry! - Can't we be angry, as well? - Hey! I get your point. - But now's not the time. Go! - Sir! We didn't come to ensure your father wins. We came for our self-respect! We're here to defend it! Come, sir! Let's go to my house! Why are you all blabbering... Athiveera! We insist! Come! We'll handle it! - We'll handle it, Veera! Come! - Come! - Just come, sir! - We insist! - Come, Veera! - Let's go to town! - Go, son. I'll manage. - We'll handle it. Come, son! Can't you hear them? Come! Come on, sir! Come on Resounding with primeval cries Rustles the jungle Come together to hunt down And win over this gruesome jungle Echoing calls for justice Sets the jungle ablaze Hasten, you lion, To attack those pouncing bulls Until the fury abates There can be no sleep In the battlefield, wounds may appear But failure should never come near If it dares to persevere Even a cat can slay the tiger Hunt, oh valiant warrior Victory alone can wipe away our woes Don't bind the arms Don't spare your foes The singing bards shall chant your praises Hunt, oh valiant warrior Victory alone can wipe away our woes The hottest flames burn not our wrath The more we hone, the angrier we rise The time to act has come our way Victory, victory, victory The time to act has come our way Victory, victory This is a day of victory A lone hoot from the owl's hollow Can't it cross the jungle's limits? The deeds of evil spirits Are not guided by a sense of justice The cackle of the crows Is but a call for a battle of songs The clucking of the hen Is but to fend her scrawny brood Hunt, oh valiant warrior Victory alone can wipe away our woes Don't bind the arms Don't spare your foes The singing bards shall chant your praises Hunt, oh valiant warrior Victory alone can wipe away our woes The hottest flames burn not our wrath They herd together to guard the hive The time to act has come our way Victory, victory, victory The time to act has come our way Victory, victory This is a day of victory Brother? Why did you call me to this run-down place? - What's going on here? - What do you mean? You claimed that you will stop Maamannan from setting foot in our towns. Yet, they are swarming every inch of our streets. - What the hell is all this? - How do I put this... You and I always abide by our caste association's decisions. But youngsters are swayed by social media and they never listen to us! I don't know what to do. I am a little stumped... What did you say? You don't know what to do? Brother... You made me fall at random people's feet and now you don't know what to do? If you don't fix this, I won't spare any of you! Don't get angry, brother. We shall fix it... If we do something big to stop youngsters from stepping out of their homes... then everything will be fine. If we pull off something huge that causes a stir in Salem... it will sort everything out. It will all get resolved. What did you say, brother? If we pull off something huge... to stir up Salem... we can sort everything out. Everything will be resolved. Are you sure? Yes, brother. It will all be fine! I swear, we can... Oh, God! Kandasamy! I don't feel good about going there, Dad. What if they create an issue? Listen, Veera. We were cadres in the same party. We've known each other for a long time. It'll look bad if we don't go. Come. We'll handle it. Brother? Maamannan and his son will be here soon. Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! - Thrash this bloody traitor out of here! Begone Maamanna, you bloody traitor! Why the hell are you here Maamanna, you damn mongrel? - Begone, traitor! - Get out of here, Maamanna! - Begone, traitor! - Begone, traitor! Begone, you ungrateful mongrel! Get out of here, Maamanna! - Get lost! - Begone, mongrel! Dad! Hey! Thrash the father and son to death! Kill them both! Don't spare them! Whack them! This mongrel doesn't get out of here alive. Break their limbs! Beat them to death! - Hey, Athiveera! - Dad! The hill is on fire, dear son And my heart bursts into flames The hill is on fire, dear son And my heart bursts into flames Pick up the drum and beat up a tempo I shall sing a dirge That lets out my sorrow Pick up the drum and beat up a tempo I shall sing a dirge That lets out my sorrow The ones who lived Shrivelled and shrunken The ones who huddled in hardship The ones who have known famine And hunger They are an army, yet are fearful Wounds aplenty, dear son Will speaking about them Make them heal? Would they heal? Would they heal? Would they heal, my dear son? Brother? Who do they think we are?! They humiliated you a lot. And yet, you made us back off? Hey! Don't say a word. Leave quietly. That's what you always say! Listen. Only six more days are left for the election. He's planning something big. I am begging you to not fall into his trap. Whatever it is, we'll discuss it later. Go home. - Go home. - Brother? What? Didn't you hear me? I said, go home. Please do as I say. Go. Go. - Come, Son. - Dad... Dad... Come on, son. Come on. A patch of thorns in the wilderness Turned a path as we trod on A patch of thorns in the wilderness Turned a path as we trod on All those paths we tread, Who has blocked them with a fence? Not knowing where to go We roam hither and thither Wounds aplenty, dear son Will speaking about them make them heal? SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM Don't be afraid, sir! We're with you! Why are you scared? Hey! Be quiet! He's beating up kids, man! He's out for blood! Do you want all of us to end up like him? Quit talking rubbish! OUR SYMBOL RULING PARTY CANDIDATE STOPPED FROM ENTERING THE VILLAGE RULING PARTY CANDIDATE WAS BEATEN AND THROWN OUT You haven't said a word since you came. Why should I always be the one to speak? Why don't any of you speak? Your father told us all to stay calm. That's why I'm asking you, what do we do? Hey, Ramakrishna! Brother! Come out, Ramakrishna! - Wait. He's family. I got this. - Hold on. - Come here, brother. Come. - Yes, brother? YOUR SYMBOL ONE STAR - What is it? - Is Maamannan's son in there? Yes. Why do you ask? Make him leave. He's my guest.

There are people in their homes who aren't a part of this. We have a thousand ways to reach them! Try to understand. Drop that. Drop that! FAIR PRICE SHOP MAAMANNAN. MLA Dad? Talk, Dad! Greetings to the people of Kasipuram. My name is Maamannan. But since I was a child, no one ever called me Maamannan. They'd always call me Mannu. I went up to my father and said, "Didn't you name me Maamannan?" "But everyone calls me Mannu.'" "Why so?", I asked. He smiled and said... "They call you Mannu as an affectionate nickname." "Don't take it the wrong way." MEN I believed it too. 088 SALEM WEST After that... After a long time, I called my son and asked him what my name was. He replied, "Maamannan." As a complete word. Not just that... He went to war with anyone who called me Mannu. After that... I reclaimed my name. Maamannan. Why am I sharing this now? You all are aware that I'm the MLA of this district. I've been to every nook and corner of this district. I've visited every home and been among you all. Not only that. As an MLA... I believe I have delivered on all my promises to you. But today... I'm unable to set foot anywhere in our constituency. Why? Why is that so? I don't understand who's trying to stop me. If I can't set foot in the very place where I served for ten years... then what can I say? Did you know... in our town, the rage of four people... can be easily turned into an affable issue for 400 people. That's what they're doing now. They may keep me from reaching you today. But now and forever... I consider every town and street to be my own. POLLING PLACE No one can deny me this. Those of you who believe in me and accept what I say... please vote on the star symbol for me. That'll do. Thank you, one and all. Brother! What the hell, brother? The father-son duo has run the entire campaign from home! You shouldn't have spared them upon the CM's threat! You should've bumped them off ages ago! Hey! I didn't spare them because the CM told me to. We must not kill them for the fact that they are our enemies. That'll be a mark of shame for us. We must enslave them once more. We must enslave them and beat them to death! Let the results come out. We'll handle it. COUNTING OF VOTES BEGINS IN CONSTITUENCIES ACROSS THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU O92 KASIPURAM SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM ASSEMBLY ELECTION RESULTS 2021 092 KASIPURAN (SEPARATE) POST BOX ELECTION 2021 WHO WILL BE THE NEXT CHIEF MINISTER OF TAMIL NADU? TODAY THE COUNTING OF VOTES IS GOING ON IN TAMIL NADU THE LEADING POSITION WILL BE KNOWN FROM 9 A.M. ONWARDS Greetings. The election results in Tamil Nadu have been highly anticipated. Throughout the state, the majority of the support is for the ruling party. He expects a change in the establishment, Thiruma. What's your opinion? I think that the ruling party will get back in power. The party's good work in the past warrants a victory. You claim that they have a majority in all the districts. But the latest breaking news is that in all eleven constituencies in Salem... the ruling party of Samathuva Samooganeedhi Makkal Kazhagam is trailing. Could it be because of the unrest during the vote-casting in Salem, Veyil? Yes, that definitely has a role to play. Because Rathnavel was a valuable asset to the party. He was the District Secretary of the ruling party. He was summarily dismissed from the party. That caused a great uproar amongst the people. The violence that ensued was not an isolated event. It was emotion driven. It will certainly reflect in the election result in Salem. If Rathnavel was the one behind the violence... then people will vote against him for the sake of peace. - Really? - Just watch. Maamannan definitely has a chance to win. Candidate Maamannan has received a total of 527 votes yet. The next candidate has received 628 votes until now. Breaking News! When it was announced that Maamannan was in the lead in Kasipuram... there was a ruckus at the ballot counting center. It is not clear if the counting will continue. What's your opinion, Mr. Thiruma? I call it dirty politics. Rathnavel's men are working to ensure that Maamannan doesn't win. Why focus only on Maamannan? He is from an oppressed caste and owes his political growth to Rathnavel's family. Rathnavel resents someone like that moving out of his influence. He's trying to stop it. First, you claim ruling vs. opposition, now you're talking about oppression. Let's steer clear of that topic. It is not easy to stop the victory of a ruling party representative. Not every problem can be blamed on oppression. We must find the cause. I didn't bring up his background for no reason. Rathnavel orchestrated riots against the ruling party in Salem. There are many prominent leaders in the ruling party. And MLAs too. But Maamannan alone has been a specific target of attack. If Maamannan had reacted, the situation would have spiraled out of control. Because of his political maturity, he chose to stay quiet. In the same vein, they're making sure to stop him from winning today. He was only leading by 300 votes. But they managed to put the ballot counting on hold. That speaks volumes. Breaking News! Sundararajan, the leader of the SSMNK and the Chief Minister nominee... has won in his Constituency. Seems like the SSMNK might seal its win in the administration again. You claimed that there will be a change in the government, Veyil. But that doesn't seem possible now. The people have chosen to retain the ruling party for the next term. Sorry to interrupt, Veyil. We have breaking news! The counting of ballots that had been suspended in Kasipuram... has now resumed. Maamannan is in the lead. Will he maintain the lead? Let's wait and watch. Madankumar's vote count for the tenth round is 1014. Maamannan, contesting from Kasipuram, was leading in the third round... but is now trailing by 348 votes in the tenth round. They have won the government back, Rathna. It seems like a close race here, as well. How long do we stall? I think we are going to face humiliation. Humiliation? Who caused it? Wasn't that you? You riled up a bunch of punks... and dared to seek sympathy? What now? Do you want me to spare them? You needn't do a damn thing! I'm furious at you. Shut up and leave. Get lost! Moron! One thousand and twenty seven votes... Next... Stay here, Dad. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Stay. I'll be right back. Stay with my father, Leela. I'll be back. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Veera! Uncle... Yes, uncle. Hey! Hey! Hey! Get him, guys! Thrash him, guys! Don't spare him! Surround him! Kill him! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, no! - Veera! - Hey! - Veera! - Don't spare him! Veera! - Auntie! - Auntie! - Auntie! Open the door! - Auntie! Where are you, auntie? Can you hear me, auntie? Auntie! Auntie! Go check on that side! Auntie! - Mom! - Veera! - Veera! - Mom! What happened? Auntie! - Mom! - Auntie! Mom? Mom! Mom! TAMIL NADU ASSEMBLY GENERAL ELECTION - 2021 Auntie! - Mom! - Auntie! Look at me, Mom! Mom! Open your eyes, Mom! It's Veera, Mom! - Auntie! - Mom! Look at me, Mom! - Your father... - He's fine, Mom! - He's doing fine! - Go... to... him... - Fine, I'll go to him. - Go. I'll go to dad. I'll go to him. The police are here, Veera. Veera... The police are here, aren't they? Go to your father. We'll take care of her. - Take care... - Yes. I said I'll take care! Go to your father! Auntie... Everything's okay, auntie. Hand me that weapon. I'll take it from here. SSMK's candidate Maamannan has won the final round of assembly elections with 65051 votes. - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! Congratulations, brother. You won. Don't forget me. How can I ever forget you? - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! - Long live Maamannan! IN THE FINAL ROUND MAAMANNAN WON BY 65051 VOTES What you want is only fair. Your father has the required qualifications and the right experience. Besides... this country needs plenty of such justice. Justice. Everyone must be able to get what they want. They must be able to do so. And that also includes the post that I am in. That's only fair. Let's wait and see! I hope it will not be like the days gone by. If we do not change, will youngsters like you spare us? Give me your hand! Come on, son! Give me your hand, son! SAMATHUVA SAMOOGANEEDHI MAKKAL KAZHAGAM Go. Go, win! ELECTION CERTIFICATE The honorable Speaker of the Assembly! What are you staring at? No one will be intimidated by you anymore. Even if you point a gun at them... it won't stop them from chasing their dreams. Got it? Go! It means... Everyone is born equal. The difference arises only in the skill with which one does one's work. Greetings! As the ultimate goal is concerned, I think none of us need to have any apprehensions. Our difficulty, as I said, is not about the ultimate future. Our difficulty is how to make the heterogeneous mass that we have today take a decision in common and march in a cooperative way on that road which is bound to lead us to unity. TAMIL NADU GOVERNMENT
