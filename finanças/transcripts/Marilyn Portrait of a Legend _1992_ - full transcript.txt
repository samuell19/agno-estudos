The file number was 149502. The mother's name, Gladys Baker, the mother's last name from a broken marriage. The child was named Norma Jean. The birth certificate carried the name Mortenson. It was a fake. Norma Jean was illegitimate. But history was being written this June 1st, for this unwelcomed baby would go from obscurity to be desired by millions. This misbegotten ward of the court would turn the heads of kings and queens, marry an internationally acclaimed author and a sports superstar, hobnob with the jet set, meet mafia bosses, the nation's Attorney General, and shake the very foundations of the White House and the family of the President of the United States. She became the beloved of millions. But one too many got next to her. Was it suicide or murder? - Marilyn took my advice on many occasions during the 16 year period that we knew each other. There were many times that she didn't take it. I would say the most crucial time that she did not take my advice was on the Friday night before her death when she telephoned me and I was back east and she told me about a press conference that she was going to have to announce her affairs with Bobby Kennedy and Jack Kennedy on Monday morning, if she could not reach Bobby Kennedy over that weekend, which, of course, she was very unsuccessful in doing. And I told her to forget that and she mentioned the fact that she had the diary of everything Bobby Kennedy had told her and I told her that was a walking time bomb. And I said do yourself a favor, get rid of the diary, don't hold the press conference, and forget the Kennedys completely. They're out of your life now, don't pull 'em back in. And, of course, she didn't do that and she ended up dead on Saturday night. - Robert Slatzer, film director and author, was married to Marilyn for a short period in her early days in Hollywood and remained her friend and confidant until her untimely death. - This pretty girl came with a nice shape, I might add, came through the revolving door and the door sort of hit her in the back, in the derriere, I might say, and she dropped this great big scrapbook she had. And she didn't have a sophisticated book that had a big zipper around it like you see today, like you see girls carry who are models and actresses, it was literally an old scrapbook, it was tied together with string and it fell on the floor, pictures went all directions and the meantime, she almost tore off part of her heel by getting through the door when that happened. So, I was sitting there and I sorta came to the rescue, and I helped her put the pictures back in place and everything. And before she was called for her interview that she was out there to see, which was her first time at a studio, I got her phone number, she got mine where I was staying at the old Hollywood Plaza Hotel that time, and we made a dinner date that night and that was the beginning of what was to become a 16-year relationship. - Hollywood in the late 1930s was called Heartbreak City due to the number of young ladies that arrived with stardom in their eyes and a dollar in their pockets. Tinseltown had more pretty waitresses waiting for their big break than the the total number of executives and technicians in all of the studios. The few who did make it were the toast of the town and the imaginary sweethearts of the world. Norma Jean didn't have to take a train or bus to Hollywood, she went to high school in the shadow of the giants, MGM, Warners, Fox, RKO, Paramount. The blossoming teenager went to the movies at every opportunity. Her favorite was the blonde bombshell Jean Harlow. - You know we drink that water? - Stop! Gee, can't a girl take a bath in privacy without... Oh, good morning. - Red Dust. Storm-lashed story of passions that fever ached in the steaming melee jungle. - Jean Harlow fan away from home at the age of 16. Norma Jean, the future Marilyn Monroe, escaped into marriage at 16. - Jim Dougherty, who was the first person to marry Marilyn, that marriage was sort of a marriage of convenience because when the foster home people, the people who had the foster home that were raising Marilyn, were leaving to go back to Kentucky. Why, Marilyn would had to've do one of two things, she'd either have to get married or she'd have to go to an orphanage. And that's the way the law read in California back in 1942. And so the marriage to James Dougherty was a marriage of convenience. James Dougherty was a neighbor of the foster home people where Marilyn lived at the time. And that marriage, of course, came to an end when Dougherty went to the Merchant Marines back around 1943, and Marily divorced him around 1946 while he was still on a ship over in the Indian Ocean. - Shortly after the marriage, Norma Jean went to work in an aircraft factory owned by the actor, inventor, Reginald Denny. It was here she took up a modeling career. The legend was about to begin. ["Candle In The Wind"] - She began posing for some of these magazines, which, at the time, were considered quite risque. They were magazines like Tit & Titter and See & Show and magazines, at that time, that you wouldn't want on your coffee table at home. - Then an major advertising agency gave her a motion picture assignment. A gas commercial. - I call her Cynthia. She's going to have the best care a car ever had. Put Royal Triton in Cynthia's little tummy. - Right, lady. - Cynthia will just love that Royal Triton. - She did become noticed by the studio, basically, by her exposure of the cover of one of these magazine. When Howard Hughes, back in 1946, was in his near-tragic airplane crash in Beverly Hills, he was in his hospital bed and he was looking through a series of these magazines and looking at the pretty girls and so forth and he saw Marilyn. And he had one of his people contact the agency, which was a Blue Book Modeling Company, which was located over at the old Ambassador Hotel at that time, and he wanted to know who that girl was and he wanted her to report to RKO pictures, which he owned. And the agent used that as a bartering situation, so to speak, and ended up getting her over to Darryl Zanuck at Fox instead of Hugh's right hand person over at RKO. So that magazine exposure did springboard her into what became her first screen test. - You come here for? - To tell you you can't stay here. If those gorillas find you here, what happens to them? Nothing? They're just going to leave them alone? What's the matter with you, Benny? You can't take such a chance. - You dumb broad. You stupid little- - What's the matter? - They followed you here, or did you bring them with ya? I oughta- - Go ahead, it won't be the first time I've been worked over today. - Norma Jean signed a one-year contract with 20th Century Fox and was provided with a new name, Marilyn Monroe. She reluctantly agreed to the name change. Her first assignment was a bit part in the film "Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!" She ended up on the cutting room floor. Her first appearance on the screen was as a waitress in "The Dangerous Years." At the end of the year, Fox dropped her contract. Studio executives saw no potential in this young girl. For a few moments she was shattered by being fired. But, typical of Marilyn, she shook her head, set her jaw, and said, in Hollywood you're never out of work, just in between pictures. Marilyn made the rounds of the studios, finally being hired by Columbia pictures for a part in "The Ladies Of The Chorus." ♪ We're the ladies of the chorus ♪ ♪ Here to sing and dance for you ♪ ♪ Our flirty, flirty eyes will wink in your direction ♪ ♪ We will throw you all a kiss ♪ That's filled with sweet affection ♪ ♪ Anyone can see I love you ♪ Anyone can see I care ♪ The way I hold your hand and smile in your direction ♪ ♪ Tells the world my heart is filled ♪ ♪ With nothing but affection ♪ Lock me in your arms forever ♪ That's the place I want to be ♪ ♪ So anyone can see ♪ That I belong to you and you belong to me ♪ - The job at Columbia was short-lived. They dropped her. She was called for a one-film assignment in "Love Happy" with Groucho Marx. Her part was a beautiful, dumb, sexy blonde. And a Hollywood tattoo was applied. She became typecast. - Is there anything I can do for ya? What a ridiculous statement. - Mr. Grunion, I want you to help me. - I've a little sand left, what seems to be the trouble? - Some men are following me. - Really? I can't understand why. - 20th Century Fox was headed by Darryl Zanuck, who ran the studio with an iron hand and little, if any, compassion for his employees. An actor was only as good as the amount of profit from his or her last film. Zanuck was the boss, the hatchet man, and many an actor quaked in their boots or high heels when they saw him on the lot. Robert Slatzer was summoned into Zanuck's office after marrying Marilyn in Mexico. - He said, here's a girl that we've invested a million dollars in so far, and the people around the world, especially the men, they'll see her pictures in the newspapers and in the newsreels, they visualize themselves as being someday married or someday possibly with Marilyn Monroe or meeting her. He said this is a girl that we portray as the young, pretty blue-eyed blonde that sits home on Friday and Saturday nights waiting for the phone to ring and waiting for that Prince Charming to come in and sweep her off her feet and give her that house with the picket fence around it and children and so forth. Well, this was the farthest thing from Marilyn's mind that she ever wanted. But this was Zanuck's big spiel. So he said, it's her career, it's not yours. And he said, we just don't want her married and I think that the two of you should seriously consider what you've done. So we walked out of the office and we spent the night talking about it, and so forth, and, to make a long story short, about a day later, two days later, we drove down to Tijuana, we looked up the attorney, we took the piece of paper, which he was supposed to file in the courthouse, which had not been filed yet, along with many others, and we bought it back, I think we paid $50 at that time in American money, which was quite a bit of money in 1952 in Mexico. And he wouldn't give it back to us because he claimed it might cause something to his reputation down there in Mexico. And Marilyn wanted it, I wanted it, and we got into a argument over the whole thing. So, finally, he took a great big stick match and he held it up and he lit the match to the piece of paper and it burned up and as we sat there, we watched our marriage, so to speak, in writing, go up in flames. And as Marilyn later on would say to friends of hers that joked about a four or five-day marriage, she used to say, well, it lasted longer than most Broadway Shows. Well, he tried to control everybody he had. I know that one time I was talking to Henry Fonda and Henry Fonda was very angry one day and he stomped into Zanuck's office and I'm going back into the late '40s when this happened, and he sounded off to Zanuck and Zanuck sat there and listened to everything for about three or four minutes and finally Zanuck stood up and spoke and he scared the pants off of Fonda and Fonda was terrified every time he'd bump into Zanuck, he would just almost avoid him if they were going down, if they were walking towards each other in the studio lot, he would take a shortcut and go someplace else. But Zanuck was actually feared. He was typical of the tyrants that ran the studios in those days, like Louis B. Mayer at MGM, you had Harry Cohn at Columbia, you had Jack Warner over at Warner Brothers, and Zanuck at Fox. And Zanuck was feared. He was a little man but he smoked a big cigar and he wielded a big club and he could blackball people and do a lot to people that is almost unspeakable. - Johnny Hyde saw the potential of Marilyn, which Fox and Columbia Studios had overlooked. In 1950, she went to work on her fourth film, "A Ticket To Tomahawk." Although the role was a minor one, she did grace a song and dance number with the film's star, Dan Dailey. The important parts Marilyn's new agent, boyfriend, and mentor, Johnny Hyde, was seeking for Marilyn were finally realized. Hyde succeeded in having Marilyn cast in John Huston's film, "The Asphalt Jungle." The role proved to be a breakthrough. The public began to take notice of her. The crime drama cast Marilyn as the mistress of the much older Rudy Calhern, who introduces the seductive blonde to everyone in the picture as his niece. In 1950 the revelation that the young girl was Calhern's mistress was not permissible. Johnny Hyde next obtained a role for Marilyn in "All About Eve." The picture was a triumph for Bette Davis. Davis' screen career was lagging and her portrayal as a once-great actress whose career was on the decline became a comeback film for her. In "All About Eve", Marilyn again appeared with an older man, George Sanders. This time she was referred to as Sanders' protege, although, once again, it was clearly evident that she was Sanders' mistress. With two convincing performances behind her, Johnny Hyde was now able to arrange a longer term contract with 20th Century Fox Studios. This was to be his last effort on Marilyn's behalf. He died in December of 1950. In her next films, she continued to play seductive blondes filled with bad intent. In "The Fireball" she's a woman interested in Mickey Rooney, but only because he's a celebrated roller skating champ. On a studio loan-out to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Marilyn appears in a small part as Dick Powell's nightclub date in "Right Cross." She received no screen credit whatsoever in the film. While on loan to MGM, she also played secretary to Jeffrey Lynn in "Home Town Story." Essentially, she was window dressing to the film, dressed in a tight-fitting sweater throughout the movie. Returning to 20th Century Fox, Marilyn continued to be cast as the sexy blonde. In "As Young As You Feel", she again portrayed a secretary in a role incidental to the film's plot. Marilyn film roles were expanded, concurrent with the public's growing interest in her. But while Marilyn was being given more on-screen time, the studio kept Marilyn confined to films of a lesser stature. In "Love Nest", she was an ex-Army WAC and the love interest of Jack Paar. However, her romance was but one of many subplots. "Let's Make It Legal", similarly, cast her in a minor role as a beautiful blonde who uses her physical attributes to advance herself. A publicity blitz which started to gain momentum in 1952 would never slow. Scandal, variety stories, exposed details of her nude photo sessions, as well as reports of her mother's confinement in mental institutions. Taking note of the surge of publicity, Marilyn was cast in her most important role, "Clash By Night." She held her own alongside seasoned stars, Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan. "We're Not Married!" co-mingled Marilyn in a multi-plot comedy as one of several women who learn they are not legally married. Finally, with the release of "Don't Bother To Knock", Marilyn was given star billing opposite Richard Widmark. Marilyn was cast as a psychotic babysitter. The Howard Hawks' film, "Monkey Business", a madcap comedy starring Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers, signaled the end of Marilyn's supporting roles. During the making of the film, she was introduced to a celebrity visiting the movie set, baseball star, Joe DiMaggio. Following a cameo walk-on in O. Henry's "Full House", Marilyn found herself a full-fledged star, as she headlined Niagara, a suspenseful thriller that saw Marilyn as an adulterous wife of Joseph Cotten. The film version of the hit musical Broadway comedy, "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", was a property in which the most important actresses in Hollywood wanted to participate. The coveted role of Lorelei went to Marilyn. Appearing opposite Jane Russell, the film grossed millions for the studio. Marilyn's salary totaled $18,000. Marilyn replaced Betty Grable as the top film goddess at 20th Century Fox in "How To Marry A Millionaire." Betty Grable's career had been waning and Marilyn's rising. [big band jazz music] - Yes, just watch the fur fly as the most talked about girls in Hollywood go out loaded for big game. Monroe, Grable, and Bacall. Adding their own wonderful dimensions the the eye-filling dimensions of CinemaScope. Letting you in on the grand and glorious adventures of three fascinating females, who pool their beauty in the greatest plot against mankind since Helen of Troy, Marie Antoinette, and Venus de Milo. [big band jazz music] ["Candle In The Wind"] - Marilyn resented being cajoled into appearing in the picture. Feeling the sting of "River Of No Return", she flatly refused to appear in the film titled "Girl In The Pink Tights." The studio responded by placing her on suspension and Marilyn countered this move by marrying Joe DiMaggio on January 14, 1954. Their wedding was an international event. Their honeymoon, which took them to Japan, began as a dash for privacy but became a series of welcoming riots. While Joe stayed alone in Tokyo, Marilyn went on to entertain the troops in Korea. Waves of frenzied approval greeted her. It was, she said, like an embrace. [audience applauding] [audience cheering] ♪ But diamonds are a girl's best friend ♪ [audience applauding] [audience cheering] - Back in Hollywood, the quickening tempo of Marilyn's career brought her the leading role in "The Seven Year Itch." The arc lights and movie stardom would blank out the cozy, candlelit home-cooked dinners Joe wanted. For Marilyn, it would be easier to please the crowd. - She felt very, very uncomfortable with the image of Marilyn Monroe. I remember her saying even to me at times when she was very, very upset with things at the studio going on, she would just put her hands up in the air and wring her fists and she would just say, I just wish I could be Norma Jean all over again. - Another tune-filled CinemaScope musical was next for Marilyn, "There's No Business Like Show Business." Marilyn didn't care for the script or the picture so the studio agreed to give her the lead in the film version of the smash Broadway hit, "The Seven Year Itch", if she appeared in "There's No Business Like Show Business." As the upstairs neighbor of Tom Ewell in "The Seven Year Itch", Marilyn threatens the man's fidelity, but even more threatened was the stability of Marilyn's real-life marriage. Joe DiMaggio resented the furor created when his wife appeared in the famous "Seven Year Itch" scene where her dress is blown up by the air rushing through a sidewalk grating. Marilyn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, announced her divorce in late 1954. - Miss Monroe will have nothing to say this morning. All I can say as her attorney is that this is what we would say was a conflict of careers. - Following her divorce, Marilyn placed herself in a self-imposed exile in New York. She spent several months studying her craft before returning to Hollywood to appear in "Bus Stop." - I'd rather say that I have director approval and that is true. - Don't you think it's important? - Yes, it is, it's very important to me. - You're wearing a high-neck dress now, the last time I saw you, you weren't. Is this a new Marilyn, a new style? - No, I'm the same person, but it's a different suit. [all laughing] The film version of William Inge's play, "Bus Stop", is quite possibly Marilyn's finest film performance. As a saloon singer with higher aspirations, she falls in love with a simple cowboy, played by Don Murray. Following "Bus Stop", Marilyn formed her own production company to produce feature films and announced her intentions to wed playwright Arthur Miller. While in New York, she had dated the then-married Miller. - Could you tell us what kind of a wedding you're going to have? - Very quiet, I hope. - Do you feel certain at this time that you will be able to get away to go to England? - I feel certain I'm gonna try awfully hard. - In the event that you are not able to go, will Miss Monroe still go? - Oh, sure, she's got to go, she's got a contract to go. - Well, that means you may not have a honeymoon together then. - I think we will. - I hope so. - Very soon after their marriage, the couple flew to England to begin work on "The Prince And The Showgirl." The prince being Sir Laurence Olivier and, of course, Marilyn was the dancer. The plot basically concerned their two different worlds romance. By the time the production ended, Olivier and Marilyn were no longer on speaking terms. One of Marilyn's more pleasant memories of the trip to Europe was being presented to the Queen. Upon returning to Hollywood, Marilyn had been offered the unique opportunity to portray her childhood idol, Jean Harlow, in a film biography. While Marilyn was eager to approach the role, Arthur Miller persuaded her to turn down the opportunity. Marilyn did play a blonde of Jean Harlow's era, however, in "Some Like It Hot." Although the film was beset with production problems, "Some Like It Hot" remains one of the greatest comedies of all times. ♪ Carefree mind all the time, never blue ♪ ♪ Always goin', don't know where ♪ ♪ Always showin' I don't care ♪ Don't love nobody ♪ It's not worthwhile ♪ All alone ♪ Runnin wild - Following her triumph in "Some Like It Hot", Marilyn appeared in her least successful film, "Let's Make Love." Marilyn's fourth marriage was also in trouble. Arthur Miller was growing cold towards Marilyn. To additionally signal the end of their relationship, Marilyn engaged in a quick but openly publicized affair with her "Let's Make Love" costar Yves Montand. On July 18, 1960, Marilyn Monroe began work on her last completed film, "The Misfits." The film would also be her costar's final film. - Why are you killing him? - Just stand aside, honey. - I'll tell you why. [shouting over each other] - Get out of here! [wind blowing] [horse whinnies] - Murderer! You liar! You're only happy when you can see something die! Why don't you kill yourself and be happy? You and your God's country. Freedom! I pity you! You're three dear, sweet dead men! Horse killers! Murderers! [screams] I pity you! - Clark Gable would die two and a half months before the film was released. Pressures during the shooting of the film were intense. Tensions between Miller and Marilyn were equally steamy. As pressure mounted, Marilyn suffered a breakdown and returned to a hospital in Los Angeles, where she remained for two weeks. Ultimately, the film ran 40 days over schedule. Clark Gable died 12 days after the film's completion. Gable's widow accused Marilyn of creating such stress for the man as to have brought about his heart failure. Prior to the film's release on January 31, 1961, Marilyn's marriage to Arthur Miller ended in divorce. To compound her personal problems, Marilyn began to turn more frequently than ever to alcohol and prescribed drugs. Marilyn committed herself to a psychiatric clinic in New York in an effort to rid herself of chemical dependencies. Upon her release from the hospital, she spent time recuperating in California. During this period of her life, she became acquainted with both President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. - In my own opinion as to why Marilyn Monroe got involved with the Kennedys, that's Jack Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy at different times, was the fact that she was fascinated with them. I think that she was very much in awe over their power. And the fact that here's the President of the United States or the senator of the United States pursuing you. And on the other hand, here's Bobby Kennedy, the Attorney General for the United States, the highest legal office in the nation. - Numerous literary sources have alleged Marilyn had an affair with the President. As the oft repeated story goes, Robert Kennedy became involved with Marilyn at the request of President Kennedy. He felt their relationship was drawing attention. In April of 1962, Marilyn was back before the cameras at 20th Century Fox, working at a lighthearted comedy, "Something's Got To Give." As in the past, Marilyn began causing expensive production delays on the film. Infuriated executives at 20th Century Fox placed her on suspension. On May 19, 1962, Marilyn appeared at a Madison Square Garden birthday party held to honor President Kennedy. - On this occasion of your birthday, this lovely lady is not only pulchritudinous but punctual. Mr. President, Marilyn Monroe. [audience applauding] [audience cheering] A woman about whom it truly may be said, she needs no introduction. Let me just say here she is. But I'll give her an introduction anyway. Mr. President, because in the history of show business, perhaps there has been no one female who meant so much, who has done more- [audience applauding] Mr. President, the late Marilyn Monroe. [audience applauding] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, Mr. President ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you [audience applauding] ♪ Thanks, Mr. President ♪ For all the things you've done ♪ ♪ The battles that you've won ♪ The way you deal with U.S. Steel ♪ ♪ And our problems by the ton ♪ We thank you so much Everybody! Happy birthday! - Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. [audience applauding] [audience cheering] - Thank you. I can now retire from politics after having had "Happy Birthday" sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way. - She returned to Fox and continued to upset the studios executives in charge by her constant tardiness. On June 8, 1962, she was fired and the film was shelved. Her last day at work took place on her 36th birthday, June 1, 1962. Marilyn adjourned to her Brentwood home to contemplate a threatening Fox lawsuit, to continue to abuse her body with prescribed pills, and to deal with her alleged romance with Robert Kennedy. On the morning of August 5, 1962, the world awoke to the news that Marilyn Monroe had died in the early morning hours in the bedroom of her Brentwood home, an apparent victim of an accidental drug overdose. - The autopsy shows that Marilyn Monroe did not take any oral capsules of Nembutal. The policeman on the scene at Marilyn Monroe's death, death room, I should say, her bedroom, at the time, had asked one of the doctors how she died. And the one doctor pointed to an empty bottle of Nembutal, and he said, here, this bottle contained 47 Nembutal capsules yesterday, today it's empty, and she must've taken 47 Nembutals. There was not one Nembutal capsule found in the digestive system. In the first place, Nembutal is a yellow capsule. It has a yellow food dye in a gel, and people known to have taken those, according to the autopsy surgeons, they have a yellow trace of stain from their esophagus all the way down to their lower intestines. Marilyn Monroe did not have any dissolved or undissolved Nembutal capsules in her system whatsoever. But what she did have was a 4.5 milligram level of Nembutal in the blood. Now, that is equivalent to about 150 capsules, according to Abbot Laboratories back in North Chicago, that manufacture the product. On top of that, the dose of Nembutal that Marilyn got was enough to kill about eight Marilyn Monroes or about three horses, that's how strong it was. The police took latent fingerprints in Marilyn's bedroom and her home and they couldn't even find her prints on her pill bottles. Everything had been completely wiped clean and we found out through the years that it was the CIA that came in and cleaned the place completely. They made it completely sterile. Every dish in the cupboards out in the kitchen was completely cleansed. There was no fingerprints whatsoever. They couldn't even find Marilyn Monroe's fingerprints in her own house or even around her own bed. It was only a diary that she kept so that she could remember what Bobby Kennedy had told her the last time they were together. Because he chastised her one day, saying, you don't remember what I told you last week and she wanted to remember, pretty much, what he had told her, so she bought this diary just as a instrument to go and write down what he told her in this book. And then, when they would have the next date, before he would come to pick her up or she would meet him, she would pick up the diary and she would read in it her notations from the last time they were together. And then when Bobby Kennedy would question her about certain things or talk about that same subject, she would be pretty much in tune with what he had to say because don't forget, she was a professional actress. She was used to learning lines. And she was very accustomed to remembering things that was written down. And this, of course, unfortunately, became one of her greatest downfalls, was keeping this diary. So I think that if the diary hadn't existed, Marilyn Monroe would still be alive. The night that Marilyn Monroe died, a neighbor, Abe Landau, who still lives in the same house in the same location adjacent to Marilyn, he and his wife came home that night on a Saturday night about 11:30 to midnight, in that vicinity, and they not only saw a police car at Marilyn's house, but they saw an ambulance. And Walter Schaefer, who owns the Schaefer Ambulance Company, which is the biggest ambulance company in Southern California, with many outlets, told me several years ago that he said, yes, he said, one of my ambulances did pick up Marilyn Monroe, She was alive but comatose. She was taken to Santa Monica Hospital and dropped off. Now, he said, how she got back at her house in her bed, dead, I don't know. We didn't take her there. But he said we did take her to the hospital. So there's still a big controversy as to whether the ambulance drivers that picked her up and took her away might have brought her back and been bribed, Mr. Schaefer didn't know anything about it. That's strictly theory. But we do know that the body was picked up and taken to the hospital, but there's no record of it ever being admitted. The patrolman got his motorcycle and was heading away from the Beverly Hills Police Station about midnight, and he ended up a few minutes later down on the corner of Olympic and Robertson, which is a main intersection of Los Angeles, going towards the eastern part of town. He saw a Lincoln Continental speeding, going east towards downtown Los Angeles and it was going about 70 to 80 miles an hour and he took off after it and when he stopped it, he found Peter Lawford as the driver and Dr. Greenson, Marilyn's psychiatrist, was sitting in the front seat, and in the back seat was Bobby Kennedy, the Attorney General of the United States. And he asked Peter Lawford where he was going in such a hurry and Lawford said, I have to get the Attorney General back to his hotel so he can pack and go up to San Francisco to meet his family. The cop, of course, said right away, he smiled, he said, well, first of all, he said, you're speeding and secondly, he said, you're going the wrong way. Now, this patrolman knew Peter Lawford personally. He had been invited out to the movie sets that Lawford had been doing pictures, he had been to his home for parties and things like that, so they were old friends. So he didn't give him a ticket but he said, the hotel where the Attorney General is staying is the other way. He said, you're going east, you're not going west. He said, turn the car around and get the Attorney General back to his hotel, but he said, stay within the speed limit. So this is another piece of evidence that Bobby Kennedy was in town, and what was Bobby Kennedy, at a little bit after midnight, on the night of August four, when Marilyn Monroe was already dead, and he had been seen at the house and there was a tape recording of Bobby Kennedy in a terrible argument with Marilyn, which was around 10:30 that night, which was taken by Bernard Spindel, who was a master wiretapper, who was tapping Marilyn's house and Bobby Kennedy's house for Jimmy Hoffa. And this is on tape. At 10:30 that night, Bobby Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were in a violent argument. There was screaming, there was a slap on the face, what sounded like a slap on the face, according to people who heard the tape. A body fell to the floor, like a thump on the floor. There was screaming, And that was all that the tape picked up. Marilyn Monroe died between that time and between midnight, the time that Bobby Kennedy's car was stopped in the Beverly Hills area. This goes back again to the fact that Bobby Kennedy had to know something about Marilyn's death. Or be involved in it, or being indirectly involved in it. I was instrumental in getting the case reopened in 1982 by the district attorney's office, but they didn't call it a reopening, they called it inquiry. And I must say it was a rather cursory inquiry because people that they questioned, that shoulda been questioned under oath, were not questioned under oath. There were a lot of people who can tell what happened to Marilyn Monroe in those last hours if they were called in. But these people were not called in because it was not under oath, and so it was a very cursory report that the district attorney's office issued in 1982. In 1985, I petitioned the Board of Supervisors, Mike Antonovich, who represents one of the districts, and who is very much is very much in favor of opening this case. And it passed five to zero, it passed unanimously by the Board of Supervisors to have a grand jury investigation of the case of Marilyn Monroe, her death. Which had never been investigated before, there'd never been a coroner's inquiry, even, which is ridiculous. So, the grand jury approved it and started investigating it and they were only on it for about four days and they were making some magnificent progress, when Ira Reiner, the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles, fired the grand jury foreman and put a stop to the inquiry, which is another part of the cover-up. And it's the first time in the history of California that a grand jury foreman has ever been fired. The Board of Supervisors rejected the reopening of the Marilyn Monroe case in September of 1992. However, there is still hope. I'm planning, along with a few other people, to go back and get the case reopened and bring these people in, there's about six or seven of 'em who are still alive, including one of her doctors, her press agent, one of her attorneys, people who know things, and if they ever were questioned, they could tell what happened to Marilyn Monroe that tragic night of August 4, 1962. And one of the reasons that I want this case opened is the fact to prove that Marilyn Monroe did not commit suicide, number one, and number two, there is no statute of limitations on murder. - Early in the morning, 30 years after Marilyn's unexplained death, technicians are readying stage five at Fox studios for the first day of shooting a feature film. A few miles away, news cameramen, tourists, old friends, curiosity-seekers, even Marilyn Monroe lookalikes are gathered at the cemetery where Marilyn's crypt is located. Call it reverence. Bizarre. Nostalgia. Love. Adoration. Worship. A good news story. Call this gathering what you may, for on the tomb there are no credit titles, just Marilyn Monroe, 1926-1962.
