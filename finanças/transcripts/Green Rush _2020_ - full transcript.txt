O Lord, Jesus Christ... ...redeemer and savior. Forgive my sins. Just as You forgave Peter's denial and those who crucified You. Count not my transgressions... A rural area of Northern California is the center of the state's new "Green Rush." A modern-day land-grab by would-be marijuana cultivators and speculators. Voters just legalized the recreational use of marijuana. California will soon oversee the largest legal weed market in the world. The horror going into now; is marijuana incorporated? This moves it from the cooperatives to the corporations. Some residents of the tour county have said that the boom has turned to bust. Sorry, did I wake you? No, it's okay. You want some coffee? Mm... no. Prop 64 was supposed to give small growers a window of time to compete. It would've stopped big corporations from snapping up land, mass-producing marijuana, and driving long-established farmers out of the business. Growers were shocked when the regulations did not limit the size of farms as expected. Rise and shine. These growers are up in arms. If you want to get licensed, you have to be able to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, we're not going to be able to take care of ourselves, legally. Small farmers are being shut down. Did you get enough sleep last night? Yeah. Bangin' them chicks again, huh? - Yep. - Yeah. Don't catch something, man. Hittin' the head real quick. She's in there. Go piss in the bush. I gotta take a shit. You... You're fuckin' late already again. It's just going to go underground again. People are not going to be willing to take the hit. Now the Green Rush has attracted a ton of unlawful pot growers. The only thing that keeps the price high, is the fact that it's illegal. Most of it is trafficked across America, up to 80% of the black market. Now, the sheriff has tried to figure out how to tackle an increase in thefts or shootings that... Locals say that the once quiet foothill community has changed and not for the best. I really believe... ...that it's going to turn out to be the worst decision that California ever made. Hey! Hey! Bro! Hey, let's go. I gotta show you something. - You change those filters yet? - No. Come on. Just leave that for a minute, you gotta see this shit! - Where we going? - You'll see. ...Caleb. Yo. New schedule. What is this? I mean that's the food chain right now, bro. Are you kidding me? - How am I supposed to live off this? - Well, that's what we got. So, I think this connects to the one by my tent, but I haven't went deep enough to check. This is what you been doing all morning? Dude, there could still be gold in there. Come on, man, you're stupid. We got work to do. Let's go. Yeah, I've been putting in work... On the perimeter: tripwire, noisemakers. Gotta plan accordingly, bro, protect what Dad left us. Oh, like his Ka-Bar? Put it back when you're done with it. Oh, if you get lost in there, I'm not coming to find you. - Yeah, you won't need to find me. - Uh-huh, sure. You'll be crying for your big brother when you need me later. Stupid... Shakedown, inmate! Nuts and butts! Oh... still jumping to the screw's voice like a good wee doggy, hey? What's going on, man? What the hell you doin' here? I thought they had you doing all day and night? Ah, you know me. No cage can break me. Need a ride? Yeah. Come on, now. Weren't they deporting that fuck? There's no way he's paroled. He was on a torture rap. Look, I'm just telling you what my boy told me, and he's just not a bullshitter, man. It's the same dude we're gonna flip Rob's shit to, all right? Wait, wait, you told a guy from LA we're sitting on a bunch of herb? How the fuck was I supposed to know Ticker was out? Maybe we should go, man. We should... we should just dip for a while. He's not coming all the way here... - ...for 15K. - There gotta be a bunch of other guys who owe him more bricks than we do. This is on you. This is all on you! You fell asleep cooking his shit. You remember that? That wasn't me! You're the one who just sent him a fucking post card! And what happens when Rob can't move all this? What happens then, huh? I'll figure something out. Hey, we need some more totes. - I just bought another 20. - Yeah, they're full. I can take your truck if you're busy. And, uh, if it's cool, since I'm kinda working for free right now, I was wondering if you could hook me up with a little something. Look, I ain't a charity. Hey, babe... Keep trimming. I'll go. I need you real quick. Can it wait? I gotta drive into town. Keep trimming. I knew it was some... I knew it was going to be some bullshit, man. - I knew it. - Why'd you get a job in the first place? I guess a blessing they cut my hours. You know how much my last check was? Seventy dollars. What am I supposed to do with that? Matter of fact, check this shit out. You won't believe this shit. Oh, what's that, your gate money? - Yeah. - How much? Guess... Hundred bucks? Eighty-three fucking cent. You believe that shit? Fifteen years for a bullshit possession beef, and these motherfuckers didn't even give me enough money to buy a Happy Meal when I got out. Poor wee baby. You want to make some real money? There it is. I was wondering when your ass was gonna get to it. I ain't interested, Tick. It's nothing heavy. Just some soft boys who owe me from before. Man, I got two months left on my probation. I ain't going out like that. Your probation officer, your boss, the whole fucking world, sees you as a criminal. So, you might as well just be one, hey? Fuck it, man. Yeah, well, I can't say "fuck" until two months from now. Until then I gotta be nice. I'll give you five grand to stand next to me for five minutes with your yard-face on. You mean this face? That's the one. That's the one. That is the one. One look at you and they'll cough it right up. All right, I'm in. But that's it though. Nothing else, man. Best decision you ever made. ♪ Come back to California ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting for ya ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting for ya ♪ ♪ No matter where you go ♪ ♪ When you leave you take a part of me ♪ Yo, Caleb. The pigs. Where's Adder? I don't know. Afternoon. Looking for Robert Hayes. Nah, he's not here. I'm his brother, Caleb, though. Nice to meet you. How long you been here? Since last fall. You boys got your papers in order? Yeah. Yeah, we filed with the county clerk last August. Don't you keep a record of that stuff? Could've saved you a drive out here, man. I want you to go fetch what I came here for. In this harsh and rapidly changing habitat, even these regal hunters can be forced into the role of scavengers, and the war between lions and hyenas over prey is at its most intense. Before humans evolved to stride the Savanah, these beasts ruled this land. But these days, to catch sight of them is considered lucky by many tribes. A lotta people with deep pockets getting into this racket. A famous boxer, putting his name on a grow down in the valley. I don't watch boxing. I thought you people were born fighters. Anyway, big corporations coming in here like that, gonna put you small-timers out of business. Ah, we just work here, man. Well, with the prices crashing from last year, not much left to pay you guys, is there? 215 compliant. Non-profit back then. Everything to code, all organic. Yeah, so is dog shit. You boys have a nice day. - Can you grab the totes? - Mm-hmm. What was he doing here? Sheriff clocked us, but you're so loved up, you don't have a clue what's going on. What is your problem, man? We're above board. Yeah, now we are. That's why we're sitting on a bunch of overstock so don't be so paranoid. - We're a team. - No, no, no. We were a team. Now, that wetback, her tattoo-necked cousin, and his junkie buddy, that's our fucking team. You talk about her like that again, and I'll hit you in your fucking mouth. - Yeah, I'm your fucking family. - Yeah, so is she. She's pregnant, man. Congrats on your anchor baby. I need to find a place to live. I need to find a new job. Well, aren't you lucky that you're good old friend, Ticker, showed up just in time. Well, I'm trying to figure out if that's the God's work or the Devil's work. What's the difference? These days, I don't know. What is this? Father O'Connell finally convert you? You know me. Chapel was just a quiet place for me to read my books. Ah, bullshit, the man could preach like a Baptist. Yeah, he'd try and lecture me about God's mercies and bible stories, but... I merely argued that if his God existed, then the animals in our books wouldn't be so cruel to each other. So, I'm curious, how did that conversation with you and O'Connell go? There wasn't much of a conversation. Turns out, I had a lot more beefs than he had fables. You ain't right, man. I call it Profane Intervention. And although hyenas have a reputation as thieves... ...they are more than capable predators. The matriarch both dominates her pack, and fiercely defends it from the lions that stalk her cubs. You need in here? When are you going to stop smoking? Whenever I'm not surrounded by all this extra weed. Well, once I sell it then we'll take a vacation. Oh, yeah? Every boy I've ever dated says that same thing, "Waiting for the harvest." Never comes. Why don't you put on a shirt? We got all these thirsty-ass guys running around here. I can't have 'em seeing all your goods. Oh yeah, don't tell me you're getting jealous? I'll make an honest woman out of you yet. Is that right? Mm-hm. Then you, me and the baby, we'll take one of those safaris. What makes you think I even want to bring a kid into this, huh? You believe everything happens for a reason. And this particular creature... - You do? - Yeah. What do you believe in? Serendipity. Whenever she's around you do whatever she says. Everything's about Maria with you, huh? You fucking jealous? Is that it? No, you're not getting my point, what I just said. Everything... No, so, whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight; I invested my college fund into this, now you're just gonna switch it up on me? We could triple our money. It was just an idea. Yeah, whose idea? It's just a little weed, Caleb. Never hurt nobody, no matter what state it's in. Hey, uh, not to intrude, but we could get a couple phony UPS trucks and... You don't own any of this, so, you don't have a say. I'm sorry. Why you walking through our bedroom? My bad, man, it was just quicker. Walk around next time. Yo, I can take the drive. I'm down to do it. No, I invested in a business, not a fucking cartel. Fuck this! You promised. This little bitch. You know, it's not worth risk right now, not with the cop that just came by. Come on, you know he's just looking to get greased. No, I made up my mind. We're not doing it. Thank you. You shouldn't have said that shit, man. Whatever, he was already being a little pussy. I fucking knew it. It's time to go now, but you know that, right? It's... it's time to go. I'm gonna stay. Adder, for once, cut your losses. Ticker's a fucking psycho. All the more reason to get the money. We busted our asses all fucking season. Nah, man. I'm packing my shit. I'm not trying to bring this to my cousin. I gotta go back to the crib real quick. I'll call you and we'll talk it out. Yo, I don't want you bringing it to her either, all right! Stupid! One little slip up and we're fucked. Everything that I built is over. And you won't even let someone else take the risk? It's not worth to risk. They're not afraid, they know what they're doing. It's not about that. I made a promise. Yeah, well, so much for this... What, you don't think I'd give whatever to protect my kid? Give what, Rob?! What?! You don't have anything. You're broke. You know... ...my dad died in the desert... so my mom and I would have a better life. Me and Caleb stashed some cash from the last harvest before the price dropped. All we have to do is wash it, and we'll be fine. Everything's gonna be okay. Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you now. These things just work themselves out. Just... No. Look, no, look, look... We can't tell your cousin just yet. Let's just keep it between us until we figure things out, okay? Well, tell Rob he can trim that shit himself then! All right, all right. All right, all right, all right! I'm coming back now. Fuck! Who the fuck are you? I didn't lose your base, man. It was... It was Diego, he burned it. All right. Where is the cheeky bastard? He found out you were out. Skipped town. I stayed because I'm gonna pay off our debt. Aw... That was awfully good of you. Smart, too. You should never run from a predator. Let's them know you're prey. Now, where's my 50 G's? Fifty? We owe you 15, man. Well, the clock's been tick-tick-ticking, hasn't it? Yo, Tick, what are you doing? I... I can get it. More than that. My bosses grow! He's... he's... he's got five times more than that up there. Oh, yeah? Mate, they're just criminals. They're not gonna call the police on you. - If there's as much as he says there is... - There is! If there is... ...you can have half. All right. I wanna thank you for what you did earlier. It means a lot. Don't worry about it. When I made t-shirts, you wore every one of them. When I tried landscaping, you picked up a shovel. Yeah, I'm still shoveling. Yeah, but I didn't want you following me back here, you know that, right? I don't regret it. But you should be figuring it out for yourself. What does that mean? You don't need this bullshit. You can go back to school. I can cash you out. I don't care about any of that. All I care about is this season being over and us being good again. This game's not for everybody, you have to live this shit. Then we'll do like you said. We'll cross state lines. I don't even know if I want to do that anymore. I just want me, her and the baby to have a real spot, you know? Yo, yo, Maria? So, it's definitely just the three of them up there. The kid brother, the guy and his girl? Mm-hm. Yeah. Yeah, that's some bullshit. Hey, yo, Tick, let this motherfucker know about the bird you was telling me about. The shrike. It's a cute little thing, about the size of a robin. Has a black stripe across its eyes, makes it look like a wee bandit. Stop me if you know what it does. Do you know? No. It plucks... ...bugs, mice, other little birds out of their homes and impales them on thorns and barb wire. Snakes, too. I gotta take a piss. Aye, snakes, too. 'Cause nobody likes a fucking snake, do they? What do you think it does then? Eats them. Sometimes, aye. What the fuck are you doing? Other times, it likes to take its prey apart piece by piece, so it can make these wee trophy displays, to attract mates. It's just the way they are. Way they was made. So, one last time; no alarms, and no surprises. It's up there about a half-mile on the right. Yeah, about that. I'm really sorry for what I said earlier. I didn't mean it. I'll try to be nicer, I promise. It's not about that. You and Maria are gonna be fine. And for the record, she suggested giving you a bigger cut. Hey, cuz. I got... I gotta go. I can't stay here. Where are you running off to? I'm not running. I just... I can't be here. Why? This season's all messed up, you know, and I'm not just gonna sit around for it to get worse, so... I've done this for you twice, now. Can you please just be cool? You think I want to be on this farm? You always have a place here, man. This is our home. - Gonna be an uncle. - Yeah, you are. Let's go. Cut through there... bring us right behind the compound. Yeah, okay, motherfucker. Remember what I said in the car. What's with all this? - Just for show. - Just for show? Well, if that's how it's gonna be, man, don't leave me empty-handed. Get the fuck out of here. Fuckin' clown. For the record, I'm not taking a bigger cut. You gotta fix the house up, properly this time. All right. I'll fix the tree house before I go. She gotta learn how to walk first. She? I just got a feeling, you know. Brother usually chills in his tent at the base right down there. You two circle around back. I'll take the kiddie's place, we'll meet up front. Don't worry about the fucking gun, worry about me. Let's go. Just pack a bag, you can come with me. You don't even have the balls to tell me why you're leaving. That guy me and Adder burned... he's out, and I can't risk him finding me. Cunt said he'd be here. Fine. If you're scared then just go. I wanna stay... I wanna stay with you. I just can't. What's going on? Says he's leaving. No endurance for it. Look, I meant what I said. If that means you're done here... It is what it is, man. Uh, can I take a few a totes as payment, or what? Don't look at me. I'd make him beg for it. Take three. I thought he was just frustrated waiting on the yield. No... He insists he's in trouble. Could've come to me about it. I coulda helped. I mean, at least, I coulda paid the difference. It's okay, babe. Don't worry about it. Talked to Caleb. Yeah, about what? About possibly, uh, buying him out. How'd he take it? Surprisingly well. Better than I thought. I guess it's gonna be just you and me from now on. We'll take care of everything. You gonna trim? I can trim. I'd rather learn how to grow though. When you gonna learn how to do that? Mm... I was thinking you could teach me now. - Now? - Yes. Like, right now? Okay. Mm... It's so sweet. When the females flower they grow these colas, which are a cluster of buds. When the males flower it produces pollen, which impregnates those colas. Sounds familiar. Yeah, but we don't want that because all that does is give them seeds, right? - Mm. - So, to get the product right, we cut down all the males before they can ruin the females. So, we kill off all the males. I think I'm starting to like this. You would, you smoke enough of it. Jesus Christ. They storing all this shit for a reason? Too much product on the West Coast. Can't shift it. So, at this point, there's not much to do besides pull the tents so we can change their day and night cycle. - So, we just feed them, watch them grow and then harvest them. - Pretty much. I can get six G's for one of these in Detroit. Detroit's a long ways from here. Where is everybody? Who cares. Where's the paper? It's... It's gotta be in the private room but they have the key. Oh, that's okay. Brought my lock-pick. We can't open up a safe without them anyhow. Let's just find the kid. They have to be in one of the greenhouses. Aye. They better be. The nursery is where the real work is. The younger they are, then the more you have to nurture them. But I like that part though. - You're gonna be such a good dad. - Oh, yeah? Ohh... I missed you. Where are youse? Shit! Hey, don't fucking move! No, no, no, no, no, he's with me! He's with me. Adder? Who the fuck is that? What's going on? There's more here than we thought. We're gonna roll 'em. Motherfucker, you said nobody else was here. There wasn't supposed to be. Oh, you're running? You better fucking run. Ticker is gonna fuck you up. Ticker's here? Run. Run. - Yeah. - Where's Maria? Fuck! There he is. There he is. Oh, hello, pal. Fuck... Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, don't run! Just don't... Don't stop. Fuck! - It's just, Caleb. Hey, stop. - No, no, no... Wait, baby. - Oh, shit. - Stop fucking moving. Oh, who's this now? Get that out your system, pal? Come here, you! Aren't you a rare creature? No way this is your natural habitat. Take whatever you want. Okay. I will. Freeze! Put us in the closet, we don't need to see shit. Shut it! Where's the keys to the back room? In my pocket. That pocket? Wrong pocket. Here? Right here? Oh, here we are. Oh, shit. So, uh, where's the safe? What? Here we fucking go. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... - Yeah! - 911... Hello. Fuck! Go, go, go... Give me the fucking phone! 911, what is your emergency? Let go of the fucking phone. I don't wanna kill you, kid. But I will if you make me run again. Now get your ass up! Hurry up! I didn't even hit you that fuckin' hard. Come on. You don't need to do this. You, uh, habla American, chica? 'Course you do. We all have to adapt to our environment. I'll give you whatever you want! Whatever I want? You sure? It's in the back of the tool shed! Well, that's enough out of him. Well, go on then. Some cunts gotta be told to do every little thing, huh? This whole deal will go a lot better for you and your brother if you just do as you're told. How do you know he's my brother? Shut the fuck up! You worried about the wrong shit. Fuck! Fuck! Hey, yo! Hey! You're the boss here, hey? Well... not no more. Don't you ever touch her! I'll fucking kill you! If the next thing... out of your gub... ...is anything but the combination to that safe, then the next thing in it, is gonna be moving at 1,800 feet per second. Comprende? Got something much nicer for you, mamacita. Try it. I'll bite it off. She speaks! Try it and I'll take that cabron's head off. Hey! Are you high or something, motherfucker? Was it there? Hey, I'm talking to you! What the fuck was that?! Huh? Get over there and zip-tie the fucking track star. You and me, we need to talk. Hey! You can't speak to me like that... Hey, I ain't tryin' to hear all that shit, man. What's with all this JCat shit, huh?! You tryin' to get us sent to death row this time? Why'd you shoot him?! - Why the fuck did you shoot him? - He was running! So, you fucking kill him? It's gonna be all right, Caleb. He owed me. Just like you. Oh, okay. I see what you're doing. You know what? I know I shouldn't have came along. You're starting the crazy ass Tick-Tick-Tick-Ticker shit all over again. Well, I ain't going out like that, man. You wanna go around here, you wanna hurt and kill people and shit? - I'm outta here, man. - Wait, wait. Where's your gun? Maria... They didn't let you have one, huh? Hey, let me take care of it. No, she's right. He's nervous. Caleb! Come on, man. Come on, man. You're nothing like them. And... and I need you. I need you, mate. Come on, let's get this dough. Let's get this money. Make me... Shut up. What are you doing? Hey! Hey! What are you doing with those?! No more dead bodies... or I'm outta here. See? See? No problem. No problem. What are you doing?! What the fuck are you doing with those, huh? Don't you fucking dare. What are you doing now? Now, why don't you move the truck... No, go on and get that truck. You go up there and get the truck. I ain't running my ass up that hill twice. Fair played. What the fuck are you doing, Maria? I said I'll take care of him. Don't be sucking his fucking finger off. That's what you get. Sit down somewhere. You is a weird motherfucker, you know that? All right, everybody, listen up. Your friend got stupid, and then he got dead. But nobody else needs to get hurt. Just tell us where it is, then we're gone. Where's what? Did you just not hear what the fuck I said about being stupid? This is all we got, man. I know it's not a lot. Nah. Somebody's lying. Yeah. Maybe it's him. Listen, man, you know what's gonna happen if my friend comes back and I don't have an answer? He's gonna kill us all anyway. Probably you, too. Who's he think he is... ...talking to you like that? Only reason he's breathing is 'cause of you. Think about it. He's already killed my cousin. He's got nothing to lose. Do you really think he's gonna share that money with you? Baby girl, let me let you in on a little secret. What? He ain't my problem, he's yours. No, he's right. He's right. He's right. Gotta stay cool. Stay cool. Get that dough. Nah. You're manso. Too tame. Baby, stop. Shh. - We're already dead anyway! - Both of you, shut up! Hey, don't talk to me like that. Everybody, shut the fuck up! It's not right. Why did he not send that skinny wee poof to move the truck? Get up, man. Get up! Get the fuck up! Where's the safe, man, huh? Where's the keys? Where's the safe?! Where is it?! Caleb, I already told him it was in the tool shed, just tell him where you moved it! You should leave before the cops come, man. I know you didn't call the cops, man. He must think he's smarter than you. He's not smarter than you. Fuck! He called 12, man. The call went through, they'll come and check it out anyway. Hey, uh, yo Tick, man. We're on the clock now. So, one more time... ...where's the fucking safe? Where's... the fucking... safe? Huh? You're gonna tell me. - Hey, uh, yo, Tick, man... - Where's the safe? Let's just get the fuck outta here, man. Stop. Caleb! Caleb! You motherfucker! You son of a bitch! Look what youse made me do. Go take care of that body out front, and load the truck. You know she's right, this is fucked! Is that money up there or not? Somewhere, but fuck this. Let's just roll before the cops come. Look, I know you don't want to go back inside. I ain't leaving here empty-handed. I can move the weed, get us paid. Come on, fuck the safe, it'll take too much time. Nah, Ticker won't go for it. You got a gun. You could drop that crazy fuck before he even knew what was going on. Motherfucker, I don't know you, and I don't trust you. No, no. Oh, by the way, great idea sticking youse in there. The closet. I don't know where it is! Well, maybe, if you think really hard, you'll be able to guess. You just killed the only person who knew where it is. No, no, no... You... you really think he's gonna give you half? You ain't never been on the inside, I can tell. Yeah, yeah, that's right, 'cause I'm smart. Nah, that ain't it at all. You're just too much of a coward pussy to do anything worth getting sent up for anyway. Ticker's batshit crazy, I'll give you that, but he ain't no liar. He'll give me mine. Yeah, yeah, good luck with that. You better get your ass inside that damn room. Please, don't hurt her. Hurt her? I'm going to make her feel really... really good. Please, she's pregnant. Is that right? When a lion takes over another's pride, you know what he does? Do you know? First thing: He kills all his rival's cubs. It forces the females into heat. Can he help but mate with them, over and over again? I almost forgot I gave you that. Thanks, mate. Come on, then, love. Let's have some fun. Come on. No! Stop! Stop! No! No! No! Baby, do something! Baby! Then you got two choices: Tell us where that safe is, or beg me to put you out of your misery. Huh? What's it gonna be?! Let's go! Gotta show you something. The cave! The cave! Tick! The cave! He just found it! It's gotta be there! I know it's there! Take your time. It's in the cave. It's in the cave. - It's in there. - Get up. Let me go! Come on in. Enjoy the show. You seem like the smart one. Keep it that way, and there's chance you'll survive all this. No, there ain't. Just let my kid have that chance. Keep walking. Oh... I guess you're not in heat yet. Might have to rip out that cub, hey? You always talk this much before you fuck? Where did they find you? Did she just... Did you just call me a wolf? Prison wolf. Straight boy who fucks ass inside. But you ain't even that, are you? County sheriff. Get that fuck! Take off your clothes. County sheriff, open up! What's with all the noise? We're... we're trying to work here. Slow. Get out here. Keep walking. How much further? It's a little ways. I heard how you reacted when Diego got shot. Where's the owner and his brother? Uh, owner is out, and his brother kinda does his own thing, so, I don't know. You sure about that? I don't know what you're getting at, sheriff, but, uh, to be honest, I'm a... I'm a little stoned. You led my little brother right to him, man. He was just a kid. Look, the last thing I wanted was for anybody to get hurt. Now, I'm sorry about your brother. But there's nothing we can do about that now. Now move. Move! See, I got a call from up here. More than one actually. Number's come up registered to Hayes. Oh, Caleb, yeah, yeah. He said he was trying to call you about that, uh, that, paper work. Had some questions. He called 911 for that? The dispatch thought she heard gunshots. Maybe he was reporting some poachers. You know, there's a lot of wildlife up here, you know? It's right there. O Lord, Jesus Christ, please forgive his sins, just as You forgave those who crucified You. Stop. Get up. Count not the transgressions, but rather his tears of repentance. I said get up! For he knows not what he's gonna do, please. Look! Look, man, you do this for me, I promise you, I'll pop off a shot and let him think you're dead. It'll all be over. You understand? Yeah, but since the calls came from this property, that gives me probable cause to look inside. With all due respect, sheriff, that doesn't sound right. Right? You mean using, selling drugs, that kinda right? I don't wanna go back to prison. I'm not a bad man. I never have been. But I need this lick, man. All right? The code's 4-9-2-9. I'm not going in there. Whatever happens in that cave is between you and God. Hey, you know, marijuana's legal now. We're paying your salary. Sheriff Garber! Have a seat. Do it! We had a bachelor party last night. You know something, getting kinda sick of listening to your bullshit. Shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bag. You got a bag? What's in there? It's just a closet. Almost done. Keep 'em comin'. Yeah. Hey, do me a favor, pick up the rest of those. Hurry up. All right! Don't move! Whoa... I'm sorry to scare you, señorita. What the fuck? I told you, we were having a party. Get down on the ground, right now! Shit! I will blow your head off! Do it, now! Sheriff! Fuckin' stupid... Sorry to scare you, señorita. My condolences. Condolences for what? You think that shot was for my man? Rob's from a family of Marines. Where did your big black sex toy learn how to handle a gun? He's a thief, not a killer. You know fuck all about it. That's why you're just a wee farm whore. My man's not dead. Swift! Say he's dead again. I don't think he's dead, but he's gone. Surprise. Gone how? He's been scheming on you ever since you went to get the truck. Asked if I could just punt the weed. I wouldn't trust you to walk my dog. It's true, even if it's coming from this piece of shit. I could tell he wanted to leave ever since you killed that kid. He wouldn't get very far. I have the keys. He could have wired the truck though. Took the other guy's car. Take the cuffs. And, Adder... leave the pistol. Aye. Come here, you. And why'd you stick around? I told you... I'm going to pay off my debt. And why? I didn't want to run from you. Smart. Sorry. Keys. Give me the keys. Give me the fucking keys! Give me the keys. Swift! Swift! Ah, I hope you enjoyed the fucking show! Fuck you! Baby, baby, I'm sorry. How could you bring someone like that here, huh? You out here?! I know you out here! Right boy?! Do you have a hair pin? - Maria! - In the... dresser. Or are you just another runner?! I didn't have a choice. Of course you had a choice! You chose! They weren't taking "no" for an answer. - Hurry the fuck up! - I'm trying! I admit, things got a little dicey back there, fucked. But if we hustle outta here now, we still got a chance for our happy ending. I don't speak fucking Spanish! Did you even hesitate to put my life in danger? - Baby, baby... - Stop fucking calling me "baby." Shit! My cousin is dead... because of you! Wait, wait, is this about... Are you knocked up for real? Fuck you. You were supposed to wear protection. You know what...? Let's just go. We'll get it taken care of, OK? Just go! Fucking, come on! Tell me you feel good... killing him like that! Make you feel like a real man?! You better run. You better fucking run! So, what, we'll just load up the weed, and then go drive a thousand miles to sell it?! - That's your plan? - Have you got a better one? That's what we were gonna do anyway! You had one job to do! One! Not fuck the shit up for both of us! And you fucked it up! I wasn't fucking expecting some clock-faced psychopath to come through the door and demand things! If it wasn't for your dumbass, he would've never fucking came here! My fucking fault?! I decide when he gets fucking paroled, do I?! I fucking decide?! - I don't speak fucking Spanish! - I don't give a fuck! You nearly got us, all of us, killed! Do you know how much fucking easier it would've been not to come back in there and fucking leave?! You want me to thank you?! Thank you! Thank you for that! A thank you woulda been fucking nice! I'm the fucking one that came down the hall... - And then what?! - ...and saved your fucking ass! Oh, saved me! Well, you know what, I wish you fucking hadn't! Look, look, look, while your... ...while your fucking baby-daddy and Cogsworth are out there fighting in the dirt, we'll be well on our way to Motown. You are fucking retarded! Do you know how much this fucking shit sells for in Detroit?! And then what? Huh? What do you fucking mean? What will we do? What will become of us? Become of us? If you'd just done that in the first place, everybody'd still be alive! Are you fucking serious? Fuck it. Still ticking. Still tick, tick... You got that out of your system? Just shoot me in the head, pal. No, I want you to take your time dying. What? What the fuck?! We'll get your fucking situation squared away, work on our next move. Let this all blow over. We've done it a fucking millions times before, we'll do it again! No. I'll leave it to the animals to finish you off. Yeah, and then what? We're all fucking animals, son. We got Rob! It's... so glad you're okay. I just got here and found Maria all tied up. Where's your car? It's the gate, they locked it, I had to... I had to leg it in. He threatened our baby. He did this! He brought them here! He got your brother killed! Maria, what the fuck! You know that's not true! Let's not start blaming each... Where is it? Where the fuck is it? You fuck! You fuck! You like fucking my girl?! She's a good fucking actress, isn't she? You think that she fucking likes you?! I swear, I prayed for protection, from everything, from this. - What, leaving me for dead? - No, that's not true! I didn't know! He was making me leave. Then why you still pointing a gun at me, Maria? Why are you asking me that, instead of asking if we're okay? We? Is it even really mine? I don't know... but... but I want her to be. I chose you. I choose you. But if that's not enough, I can raise her on my own. I got nothing left to give, Maria! Why don't you go get your money bag from your other friend in the cave? Please, don't make me do this. What... what else do you want me to give? What do you want from me?! What do you want me to do?! What do you expect?! How do you expect me to make this work, huh? After this? Because you believe in serendipity. Hey, no! No! No! Baby! The mythology for these enemies is well-known. And although hyenas have a reputation as thieves, they are more than capable predators. The matriarch both dominates her pack, and fiercely defends it from the lions who stalk her cubs; for the lion and hyena are sympatric. And although they fight for resources and respect, their behaviors are quite different. In the pride, the alpha protects his territory from rogues, while the lionesses hunt. But a hyena cannot rely on companionship from her pack. The social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative. And this particular creature must embrace her independence and learn to hunt alone. For she must remain, above all, a survivor.
