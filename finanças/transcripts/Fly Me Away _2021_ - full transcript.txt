Shit! Beware. You are entering a wet zone. Recalculating your itinerary. Sorry, I... I knocked over my glass. Make the next possible U-turn. Don't worry. I'll deal with it tomorrow. Make the next... Marcus, come on! That's Hector. He still takes him along when... Maïssa, this is serious. I used to be able to force him to take his pills. Now he does as he pleases. And I tell him every day. He's stopped listening. He's growing up. Tell me about it! We can't complain though. Who'd have imagined... Thank God. And thanks to you, Doctor. Thanks to him especially. Know what he said yesterday? At least when I die, the pain will stop. He must start fighting again. For that, he needs you, us, and to take his meds. We'll get him smiling again. Right, kiddo? FLY ME AWAY Based on a true story Card declined. - For 6.50? - Sorry. So try this. - Yes? - You blocked my cards? - Stop by the hospital to talk. - I have no money and no car. And no phone soon. I canceled your plan. What? Why? - Hurry. I operate at 6 am. - Wait! Dr. Reinhard? Yes, himself. Undress for the exam. - You are? - Don't listen, it's his son. No smoking in his office. - How's the family, Clarisse? - Fine. - How about you? - Everyone's fine. - Wait, don't run off! - I'm off to the ER. You're a fast walker! - High school track team. - Me too! Tomato soup? - I won't sleep with you. - Excuse me? I'm frank when I'm tired. And I'm very tired. You look great. Your nights out suit you. Don't work too hard. Dad, I told you I network in clubs. It's full of VIPS. - "VIPS"! - You don't even care. No, I don't. Come meet someone important. I hope you'll understand. See that kid? He's 12. His name is Marcus. He was born with a heart defect. A spinal deformity. Kidneys shot. I'll spare you the rest. Meaning? Meaning he's in constant pain. To breathe, walk, swallow, pee. Can it be cured? It can be treated, not cured. He was born living on borrowed time. He spends his days here or at a care center. His nights, at home with his mom. He never goes out. That's his life. Why tell me all this? He's always been a fighter. He's giving up, which means he'll die. Someone must help him experience new things. Like all kids his age. A full-time job. - Should I ask around? - No, don't bother. I found him. Come on, this isn't for me. What can I teach him? I promised myself to keep him alive as long as possible. So I'm keeping your promise? What if I say no? I'll cut you off. Pack up, leave the keys and forget my phone number. - It's your call. - Is this a joke? Is this a joke? Since when are you on Insta? Wrong answer. To Adèle plus 16 others... You busy tonight? - Hi, are you Thomas? - Yes, hello. Astrid Garceau. I'm the director. Shall we go? - You must know centers like ours. - Yeah, more or less. Except for the most serious cases, the kids come just for the day. Like Marcus. - He knows I'm coming? - Yes, he knows. His mother told him. God knows what he thinks. The ones who passed. We light candles to show they're in our thoughts. Marcus? This is Thomas. - Dr. Reinhard's son. - Hey you! Hello. I'll leave you. That's Hector. I'm mending his scarf. I intended to do it later, but you were late. Marion! - It's just epilepsy. - Marion! It's Benjamin. I need to go pee. Children's Rehabilitation Center Number 2? Number 1 is when you pee. Okay. That's a great way to break the ice. - The kid has his own ambulance. - Yep. Pretty classy. Hello. You look pretty good for a sick kid. And you look like crap for a dude in shape. Live with your parents too? - With my dad. - Not you mom? No. Where does she live? She died. A long time ago? I was your age. - He always drive so slow? - Yep. - Excuse me, can you go faster? - No, I can't. - Just a little bit of siren. - Forbidden. The kid needs to pee. - There's a pistol. He knows. - A pistol? What the fuck? A urine pistol! Gangsta rap! I don't even need to pee. Since you're all against me, take my spot. There you go! Wake me when we get there, thanks. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - What is it? - This is where you live? It's a shit-show, what can I say? Anyway... There's no room. I'm loaded down. I think the stairs work. Thank you, excuse me. - Is he crazy or what? - Rouvier. Our upstairs neighbor. - He thinks I act sick to get welfare. - What? - Now he'll block the elevator, as usual. - No way. - See? - What an asshole. - One euro. - What? My mom and I put a euro in a jar when we swear. - That's serious shit. - Two euros. Two euros... Know what? Here. There. It's an advance for today. - I'll get the elevator. - I can't be left alone. - I'll be one sec. - I can't be alone. There are ton of advantages to being disabled. Don't crack me up. Now I need to pee. - What do you mean by that? - I gotta piss. Don't be stupid. I'm not ready. We just met. What experience do you have with kids? I was one... and I still am. 25 years' experience. Mom? Can he have dinner here? No, I mean... that's nice, but I... I'm meeting some financiers tonight. I can't, sorry. Marcus, tonight was a first meet. But ask Thomas if he wants to spend time with you. Sure. Yes, yes. See you tomorrow. No school on Saturday. - Great. 3 pm? - What? That late? I'm up at 7. - 7? - Yeah. In the morning? Oh yeah. Okay, then... noon? 11:45? 11:00? 11 o'clock. It's the Bet-Online of AI... - We haven't closed, but the... - We'll spend a lovely evening. - How about breakfast? - I had mine this morning. With your dad. But... Did he mention me? Not a word. He was in a rush to go play golf. Golf? What time is it? - 11:30, noon. - Oh no, fuck! - What's wrong? - It's noon, dammit. It's noon! Oh fuck. Noon! Fuck. You want an apology note? Sir, we're here. We're here. The oxygen bottle must never leave his side. - Never. Keep it on you at all times. - Okay. Even in the bathroom. Screen time... tablets, TV, video games, is 30 minutes a day. - 30 minutes. - Tops. No candy, no sugar. No cookies. And no fast food at all. He has diabetes. - He has that too? - Yes. No sports, no exercise. No second-hand smoke. Avoid overpowering emotions. And don't contradict him. - That's more or less it. - And so what's left? Everything else. You can talk, read, listen to music. - Go for short walks. - Oh yeah... that "everything else". Go see a show. He's only seen school shows. Kirikou! Why Kirikou? Yeah, right. GLOVE PUPPETS The Musical - I'm twelve, not four. - I loved this when I was your age. It's Guignol, it's Guignol Who punches the police! You're a fan. We sell the CD with the songs. The CD? Great! Great idea. - No, I'm good. - Don't be shy. Léa, get a CD. My niece is on vacation here. Nothing to say, Marcus? Thanks. - Haven't we met before? - Nope. I must have dreamt it. You want a coloring book? Sure. - A coloring book. - A mug? - It was in the bag. - You're such a pain. - Why not get her number? - Lay off me. Girls are easy. - No way! - Manon... How are you? You babysitting? This is my little brother. Can't you tell? I see! Like the showy-poo? He's a little blasé. I found it cool. A selfie with Guignol? - Bye! - Bye. - You were saying girls are easy? - Come on, lay off. - Who was the lady? - Mary Poppins. You dummy, who is she? She's... a girl who won't cry at my funeral. It's the biz, bud! - What's on for today? - What do you feel like? Go to a soccer field, watch the champs training. - The champs? - Yeah. Let's go to the Champs. Oxygen. - Oxygen. - Oh fuck! There. Okay, let's go. - Everything I want, right? - Yeah but it's like at Christmas. You never get it all. And the stuff for sale, what's my price limit? Chill, my dad has no time to spend his money. We're doing him a favor. A new cell phone... sure, okay. New sneakers, yeah. - A PSG jersey? You like the PSG? - I love them. But are you a real fan? - I adore them. - Really? - Yeah. - Say "I love the OM". Say "I love the OM". "I love the OM". - Come on! - Never. "Sing a karaoke song by Goldman, Berger or Balavoine"? - You listen to them? - A lot, with Mom. You're a 50-year-old dwarf. "See the ocean." Okay. "A night in a fancy hotel." Ready to pay? He's writing his last wishes. Can it wait? - Excuse me, of course. - Thank you. "See Mom happy again." "Fall in love." Okay... red for "difficult". "French kiss with my tongue." - Stop! - You haven't kissed at your age? - Nope. - Good thing you found me, buddy! Let's go. - Why did you take a 2-year plan? - A 2-year plan means the phone is free. - I may not be around. - Don't worry, I'll take it. - Where are we going? Tell me! - Trust me. This is ridiculous. - I swear that... - Stop! Trust me, let me guide you. - Really love the PSG? - Yeah, why? Thanks! Look! You look like him too. You totally do. - Come on. - Wait! - Come on, Marcus. - The new jerseys! Little quiz, okay? - Who's number 7? - Mbappé. It's written behind you. - Number 10? - Neymar. You can't read? They screwed up. It's not Neymar. Don't start sobbing. Try it on instead. See? - Thanks, you all rocked. - Our pleasure. - Marcus - Neymar. - Next, Marcus - bird. - Come back up. - Wait. Come back up! Go right... 1, 2, 3! See? I'm flying! This is so cool! Enjoy it? Marcus, what's wrong? Answer me! - Oxygen. - Fuck, the bottle! Where the hell is it? Stay with me! I'll be back! Fuck! Are you his caregiver? I am. The bag was near the dressing rooms. You're lucky I'm a doctor. He could have died. - Will he be okay? - Yes, he will. Won't you, kiddo? It's too much responsibility for me. I'm not a doctor. So why did you come? I don't know... To see if I was up to it. In barely 2 days, you almost croaked. If this is about the oxygen, relax, I won't tell Mom. That's not my point. I can barely manage my own privileged life. How can I manage a handicapped kid's? Sorry. I'm doing this in your interest. Dude, don't sulk, please! - I have to come. - No need. - I'm obligated to. - No more obligations. Give me my oxygen. - Give it to me! - Dude! We got each other's numbers. Welcome... to my enchanted kingdom. It's so nice. - I'm just saying what I think! - My dad's here. Come on. It's not working. Let me. You're drunk, you're hopeless. - This isn't the right key. - Of course it is. Come on, follow me. Dad! Am I stoned or is there a car in the pool? No, there's nothing there. Okay, here he is. - I can't open the door. - It's normal. I changed the locks. - You could have told me. - Yes, I could have. Can you open the door, please? I packed your bag. Some clothes and a toothbrush. Wait, are you serious? You and I had a deal. Something comes up, you give up as usual. I almost got him killed! Dad! Uncool dad. - Your place? - I live with my parents. - And I have a Math quiz. - A Math quiz? - How old are you? - Seventeen. Well... next week. Hey girls, it's Charles. Leave me a message. What are you doing here? Ever since we spoke of tomato soup, I was dying for some. So here I am tasting it. Five fruits and veggies a day doesn't agree with me. It doesn't agree with me at all. Do you have... an anti-spasmodic. Nope. But I have better. - It's freezing! - Really? Too cold. It's cold! I'm gonna complain. Can I sleep a little here, please? If I go out in this cold, I'll die. We treat patients, not daddy's boys who can't drink. Thanks, how nice. Sorry to bother you. You look beat too. Wanna squeeze in? - Yeah, I'd love to! - Cool! I'll scoot over. You have one hour. - Is Charles here? - Charles? Charles, the guy who lives here. Charles! - There's a guy here. - Yeah? - How you doing, bro? - I called all night. Sorry, I'm in a meeting. Brainstorm with us, it's fun. Can you lend me your car? - No... Not my Alpine, come on. - Just for today. Okay... here. - Thanks. - Give Uncle a kiss. You're a champ, you know. Take care of it. If you don't take your pills, you'll die. You hear? No, I'm fed up! Stop acting like a baby. Enough already! Don't count on me calling an ambulance again. I thought that... Can I see him? Leave me alone, Mom! I thought you were scared to kill me. I realize I'm not that scared after all. And... my life is so cool without you, it was almost too much fun. So I was thinking... maybe we could keep on not having fun? If you want to. You're so messed up. Any idea how to treat it? Plus these two. - You take them all? - Yeah... and twice a day! - How many all together? - Sixteen. Sixteen, really? - 16 is nothing. - You don't know the side effects. - Feels good, I guess. - Oh yeah? Try, you'll see. - Another one? - Another one! One more. That's 16. Easy-peasy. - He took them all. - What's your secret? He took them all too. Same as me. All 16. Unbelievable! You're out of your mind! You hadn't noticed? - Who is it? - Jean-Louis. We're going to church. - Who's Jean-Louis? - Guy from church. He's into Mom. - What's he like? - You'll see. Hello, Marcus! Looking good! - You must be Thomas. - Yes, that's right. - Maïssa mentioned you. - What's today's program? Forest excursion. Have fun, honey. Shall we go? No agitation. And texts with pictures every 30 minutes. I promise. On his life. Yeah, right. Don't forget the pictures. - Fuck. - I told you so. The joke's on me now. - Welcome to my world. - How reassuring. You'll see, it comes and goes. Where are we going? Okay. Come. Here. - What is it? - Press. - Seriously? - Thought I was a loser? Wow, it's gorgeous! Is it yours? Not really, but yeah, in a way. Promise me not to laugh. Honestly, we have welfare to thank. I reaped tons of benefits and paid cash down. And for drug deliveries, you can't get better. Cops can't keep up. Let's get in. Vive la France! - What's up? - Drive. - What? I can't drive. - Makes it more fun. So, the pedal on the right: accelerator. Brake on the left. No, just one foot. One for both. - Same foot. - Understand? If I were you... I'd fasten my seat belt. One foot! What are you doing? You're using both feet. No left foot! Marcus, your right foot! The same foot! There you go. You good? Having fun? - You want to try faster? - Yeah, I love this! Champions of the world! Marcus, if you're a badass Put the foot on the gas Go on! Faster, faster! - Stop, Marcus! - I'm taking off. Slow down! Brake! That's what I call braking. Sorry. Don't be, you nailed it. I was freaking out. - She won't buy it. - Think I'm stupid? Go on. One... two... three. There. "Learning... about botany in the forest." Sent. Careful. - Near miss. - Gross. Wait, wait. I have an idea. Marcus, we're living your dreams. Thanks to you, I'm living mine. - Like what? - This. Legally using a handicapped spot. - Life-changing! - Whatever. Look at this. Check if he's spying. - Yeah, as usual. - Stay here and act like a lookout. - Act suspicious. - Why? Just do it. What's he doing? What's... Come on. There he is! Go on, you idiot. Make our day. Yes, yes... Quick trip. Where were you? What are they up to? Listen to what we did to Rouvier. No, I'm not listening. I don't want to know a thing. - Too funny. - You're okay? Marcus, shower time! There we go. Thomas! Want to sleep here tonight? You hitting on me? Dummy. - Mom, can he sleep over? - You just asked him. Of course he does. Sure I do. - Goodnight, honey. - Night, Mom. - Sleep well. - Goodnight. - What do we do tomorrow? - Calm down. You'll have another attack. Okay... - I really have to sleep here? - Yeah. So I'll tell you the schedule tomorrow. Today's the last day. The girl's gone. It's just Auntie. - Ask her where she is. - Probably at school. It's vacation till Monday. I see! You're a serious pick-up artist. Go on, please. Come on! Only because I like you. Because her... Thanks. So? She was here for holiday. She leaves tomorrow. Tomorrow? - And... - I know what you want. - They're seeing a movie. We're invited. - Really? We've got a real problem. - Auntie. - Why? - She has the hots for me. - Who cares? What do you mean? Did you see her? My mother says all that matters is the beauty within. - That sounds like your mom. - What are you implying? You think she's ugly? - Are you gonna tell her? - Yes. Forget it. - C'mon, say yes for the movie. - I already said yes. Thanks! It's a nightmare. I'll wake up soon. Forget roses and hand-kissing is over. Louis XVI is history. What do you know? You were never in love. - I'm experienced with girls. - Will any of them cry at your funeral? - No but who cares if you're dead? - Okay, but I want to offer roses. You'll look like... Are you okay? Marcus, are you okay? - Calm down, breathe. - What? - Marcus, take it easy. - Please... - Roses... - Just breathe. Breathe! What's going on? Are you okay? Calm down. Keep on breathing. Breathe, calm down. I promise I'll get roses. Stay with me. Okay, I'll stay with you. The look on your face! Wait, wait... You did that to me? You're an asshole, you know! - Are you serious, Marcus? - Let's go for roses. What's wrong? - She's there. - That's the point. But what do I do? - I don't want to go. - You kidding? - I'll look dumb with my oxygen. - Only this looks dumb. There. Come, you'll crack a joke to break the ice. Okay, handsome? A little joke. - Do you remember Marcus? - Of course. Hi, Marcus. Why did the man go to the bathroom with a deck of cards? - Yeah, to get a royal flush. - They're so cute. Let's get the tickets. I was afraid to come. Of what? That you'd find me stupid. I'm shy. - Why are you laughing? - I was freaking out too. Really? That reassures me. - Want to slip out for a bit? - Yes. No, no, no... I mean that... I can't leave the kid. - Naughty boy. Don't like to play? - Yes, yes, I love to play, but... It's complicated with Marcus. I'm really pissed off because... I'd love to have... You know what. - My joke really sucked. - Yeah, it sucked big time. Thanks, Thomas. - Time to say goodbye. - Already? Come for dinner! - Yeah! - Come on. Yeah, but no. Sorry, but I need to get him home. It's early! I got a message from your Mom. A problem. - I didn't want to tell you. Let's go. - What happened? I'll explain afterwards. Let's go. See you soon! What happened to Mom? Nothing. But I'm not giving my body to Auntie so you can kiss! - What? You lied to me? - You lied too. - You suck! You ruined everything! - Calm down! Truth is, I'm doing you a favor. See Léa when we left? Don't give in so fast. Play hard to get. She'll be crazy for you. Aren't I right? What? - Don't move. - Dude, not again! Be right back. Léa! For you. Thanks. - See you soon. - See you soon. I was worried. - Get the video? - Of course. - You finished late! - Big program. Come, honey, it's bedtime. Hospital exams first thing in the morning. Thomas has another surprise for me tomorrow. I can push it off. Tomorrow he does all his bloodwork. He needs rest afterwards. - We can push off the bloodwork. - No, honey, you know that's a bad idea. I don't want to go, Mom. - We have no choice. - "We" don't get injections! - We have to, it's for your... - Stop saying "we", dammit! You don't get jabbed nonstop with needles! You're not stuck in a hospital with kids you're not friends with! I'm with you every night! I'm sick of it. My life is shit! I have no life! I'll never get better and you know it! This is not a life. Marcus. Come here. No. Come, honey. I can't stand it anymore, Mom. Unclench your fist. - Just the anemia shot and we're done. - I don't want it. - I promise you won't feel a thing. - I said no! You say that but it hurts! - I swear... - He's right. It's totally dumb to say that. - Thomas, maybe we should let... - You took 25 liters of blood. He's not four. If he says it hurts, it must hurt. There. Okay, give me that. - Playing doctor? - With great pleasure. But after his shot. All right. Here we go. Thanks. I decline all responsibility. - Worst shot ever, okay? - Okay. I'm warning you: I always miss. Here we go. Farewell, Marcus. - Ouch! - "Ouch"? You a wimp? Interesting technique. So now I'm interesting? - You didn't feel anything? - Uh, no? You should always call in the pros. Yes, right. You like him? - He's looking for a girlfriend. - Not at all. No one's gonna cry after he dies. Doesn't surprise me. And you? Will anyone cry for you? Probably not. If you're dead, who cares? - What? - Nothing. The only good news: his diabetes has stabilized. He was careful about food, or someone was for him. But his creatine is still high. His kidneys are ailing. What'll you do? - Wait. - That's all? Got a better idea? - Dunno, I'm no doctor. - Maybe that's why he trusts you. No more diabetes! To celebrate, maybe he can sleep over one night. Please, Mom. Say yes. - He'll brush his teeth. I swear. - Thanks. Here we are. - This is your house? - Yeah, it is. Surprised? - It's so pretty. - Cool, right? Here's the pool. How long was your longest relationship? - At school. Six months. - Six months? That's not long. Long enough to flunk out. - Med school? - Yeah but I found it boring. And two doctors in the same family, what's the point? - You ask to marry her? - Are you crazy? - I'd marry Léa. - You kidding? You still have Auntie's number? I must have it somewhere. You don't have to marry your first crush. Why not? I'd like to have a normal life. And if I could live and grow old... I'd have a family, lots of kids. A house with a garden. A dog. Maybe a rabbit too. Even if they die young. - That's your goal in life? - Yeah. Dude, I thought you were 50 years old. You're more like 80. Come on, big day tomorrow. Too bad Léa didn't see me sing. Okay, Marcus... I need to come clean. The first time I came to see you. I did it because I had to. I had no desire to come. I was pissed off to have to. Either I came or my father kicked me out. I played along. For purely selfish reasons. That was shitty. I know, but I never said I came of my own free will. I mean, I never really said why. I didn't lie... Yeah, I acted shitty. I'm glad you're not looking for excuses, but you should apologize. Because now, I find your behavior really shitty. - You're right. I'm sorry. - That's not enough. You should say you were a real shit and beg my forgiveness. I was a real shit. Will you forgive me? It sounds pre-recorded. Say it with love in your heart. - Love in my heart? - Yes. - You want me to lose all dignity. - Yes. I acted shitty. I'm really sorry. Will you forgive me? I forgive you. Let's go. Wait. I should come clean too. Think I didn't see you didn't care about me? Guys like you? I may be broken, but I'm no dummy. - You idiot. - What do we do? I'm gonna try to redeem myself. - Wait, where are we? - We're... - What stadium? - Parc des Princes. - No! Really? - You bet, buddy. So cool! Wait a second. - What's that? - Get in it! - Are you kidding me? - You want to see PSG play? In a wheelchair? Too embarrassing. I'd rather not go. Okay, I get it. You're the boss. This is going too far. Don't sulk. Handicapped people are lucky. - You're lucky to know one. - Yep. - I got you some seat! - Amazing! Are you stupid? Sit back down! - It's a miracle! - A miracle? It's Rouvier. Come on, come on! Thanks, how kind. Hey, watch out. - Life treating you good? - Yeah I guess... thanks. - The kid's not... - Him? He's in excellent shape. Yeah. What are you doing for Aïd? For Aïd! Slaughtering the lamb in the bathtub? Oh yeah, of course. Know how to cut its throat? My cousin does free demonstrations. - Funded by the State. - Chill. We're used to it. Inchallah! - Did you have fun? - Very, very big program. I have to tell you. In the elevator... with Rouvier... - Are you okay? - I'm thirsty. - Is there fruit juice? - In the fridge. - He took his pills? - Yeah, as usual. Marcus! We need the oxygen. There's no pulse! - Turn him on his side. - Marcus! Just where I want to be. Pulling out. We detected an increase in inter-ventricular communication, a hole in the septum. The septum is a wall dividing the left and right sides. It's making the heart pump too much blood. So I repaired it. We'll see how Marcus reacts to all this. We must wait. And pray. - He doesn't even have Hector here. - Hector? His lucky teddy bear. I'll go get him. - What "ah"? - Our main concern is not the teddy bear. Really? In fact, only you can help him. All we can do is watch or fuck up? - I never said that. - You think it! What do you know about Marcus? You know what he feels? - This may not be the right time. - It's never the right time with you! You have no time. You never had the time. Did you ever ask me how I was doing after school? You cared only about patients. All those pretty pictures. They are pretty. Not one of mine. Why never put one up? Even on a wall at home. You know... who I'd confide to at night, alone? My teddy bear. Pathetic, huh? So I'm getting Hector. Because it matters to him. And to me. Thomas! - I'm sorry. - Doctor, don't be angry with him. Don't be. He's afraid, that's all. That's all. Hi. I wanted to know how you were. I don't know... I wonder if I fucked up somewhere. No, it's not your fault. His state didn't deteriorate because you had fun. On the contrary. It's a miracle he's still alive. Wanna grab a bite? At the cafeteria? I thought a notch above frozen. Somewhere more... You get my drift. Okay, you mean a date? Exactly. - Yes. - So you use a sick kid to get a date. You have no scruples. Not one. - But I know he'd agree. - Really? Know what? I'll ask him. Yeah. A night in a fancy hotel. See Mom happy again Fall in love Kiss with tongue Here. - You okay? - Yeah. Thanks. I should have picked you up at school that day. I should have, so you could say goodbye to your mother. I thought it was a false alarm... I don't know. It's not your fault. You couldn't know. That time, I should have known. Marcus woke up. Come on. It was a success. The bad news: you have three weeks of me until you get out. After that, my crazy counterpart will oversee your PT. But the good news... you'll be on your feet for your birthday. That's my present. You don't have to speak, honey. Thanks. You're ugly. You too. Come on, Marcus. Just three weeks of physical therapy. I'll be here. All your pals too. Karim will come. Who else? Everyone. Nice and slowly, good. You're good, don't worry. I'm here. Good work, Marcus. Perfect. Little smile for your mom. Go on, Usain Bolt! You okay? All good? One small step for man... one great step for mankind. Come on. There you go. King of the world! Good job. Perfect. - Really? - You bet, man. - You had it repaired? - You bet, buddy. - What are we doing? - Finishing our list. Mom! Sweetheart. Stop it, boys. Excuse them, sir. Are they always like this? Mom! Can you believe it? "Dear Marcus, I'm proud of you. Tomorrow you celebrate your 13th birthday. Henri." - Who's Henri? - My father... Dad. So? I never knew this existed. Happy birthday. Thank you. I never thought I'd make it to 13. Careful, the older you get, the worse life gets. It's time. Happy Birthday, Mom. It's not my birthday. Without you, I wouldn't be 13. It's 8:27. 8:27. 13 years ago, at 8:27, I took you in my arms for the first time. And one hour later, you were taken into the ER. What is it, Mom? Nothing, it's just that I'm happy. And it makes you cry? Because I'm very, very happy. - Mom. - Let's do it. Happy birthday, honey. - "Making Mom happy again" is done. - Yeah, what's left? "Falling in love". The hardest one. For me at least. I almost got lucky with Léa, but I blew it. - Because of you. - More than one fish in the sea. Open your eyes. Her, for example. They look alike. From behind. But it's not Léa. She's her spitting image. Wait... it's her! - It's really Léa! - I think so. - I think she expects you. - How did you do it? Auntie. - Just like that? - Meaning? She said, "I'll set up a date with Léa." No questions asked? - No, questions were asked. - Wait, wait... - Keep your conjecture to yourself. - I'm moved. It moves me because you love me so much, you were willing... Enough, enough. Go on. If she's not into me and won't see me again, what do we do? You drive me crazy with your "what do we do"'! No more "what do we do", no more "we". Manage on your own! - Go on! - No, forget it. Marcus, that way! Dammit, Marcus... Come on! Come here! Thanks. Thank you. Go on. Oxygen. Excuse me, the 9 am Anatomy class? First floor, main amphitheater. It's "cum tempore". - Cum what? - 9:15. So you all speak Latin here? Thanks. Starting med school late? Yeah. After you finish your specialty, it'll be time to retire. Yeah, sounds like a plan! FLY ME AWAY Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA
