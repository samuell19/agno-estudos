Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Right here. That's good. - Twenty-four. Twenty Oh, I wish I was 24 again. How old were you when you got started? When I started? 24. That's when I first started. How about now? Now, I'm 39. And it's almost my birthday. I get the happy birthday. - I get the happy birthday! I hope this one's meh. Don't be weird. Oh, my God. Stop it. Mia, let's go sing "Happy Birthday" to you. * Happy birthday to you * Say, "I'm the man." Do it! Say, "I'm the man." Now, look who the man is. This guy! No, do one! Come on!

Goodnight, daddy. Jax, get back! Need to sit down? Meds working? Do they ever work? I'm gonna go out for a run. ...last round. What's he gonna do to you? - Nothin'. - Exactly. - Is he gonna be bigger than Joe? - No. - Is he gonna be stronger than Joe? - No. - Okay, and you were taking Joe down at will. - Yes. - Yes. You broke his goddamn finger. - You took him down. - Yes. Okay, there's no way this man is gonna be as strong and as big as that man. - No. - You were doing it to him. - He couldn't stop you. Okay? - Yes. You gotta put your mind to it. - Yes. - And you gotta do it. - Yes. And you gotta keep doing it. - Yes. And doin' it, and doin' it and doin' it until it gets done. Kill that motherfucker. Joe, come on, man, get your head in the game. Take his ass down! Turn, Joe! Pull guard! Joe, go! Joe, get up! There you go. Pull guard, Joe! Pull guard, Joe! Punch! Punch! Heh-heh! Happy birthday, Joe. - That was for Joe. - Joe, the old man. Break time! Break time, fun time for you, Joe. So, who are you fightin', Joe? Clayton Hoy. Conan the Barbarian! - He looks like a Greek God. - The guy is fit. - Look how big he is! - That's -- that's Conan. - I know. - Man, that dude is legit! Yeah. So, you have to lose 25 pounds? You need to shave that fucking beard because that's gotta be a pound, at least. - Take a lot of shits. - He is in really good shape. Hi, mom. Hey, dad. - So, you forgot to decorate for my party. - Yeah. Want me to blow up balloons? Sure. You can put those up. - It doesn't stretch far enough. I'll get a piece of string. You don't seem to be your happy, jovial self, Joe. - Yeah. - I'm tired. - Yeah. - Whipped cream! - Oh! - Shh. - Put it in my mouth! My mouth! No. No. - I'm third. - Second. - You got to go upside down. - Stop. - Stop. - Last. Can I do one? Oh, my God. Jonah, Jonah, Jonah, Jonah, Jonah. Stay over there. And don't move from that couch! I'm not joking. Sit down over there with him. Get over there with him now! Oh, there goes dad. Tired of you two little idiots. Sit right there and don't move. Who called? What the hell is the matter with you two? Watching you like a bunch of retards running around the house. You think it's funny? - Hey, Mike, remember those days? - Daddy. Sit down! Michael, I guess you're like.. ...if I have to get up. What is it? The whipped cream! Aah! - The P word. - Grandpa. - Ah-ha-ha. Huh! Huh! Huh! Come on, Joe. Come on, old man! Clayton's waiting! - Joe! Are you going to have some? I'll have some later, I'm gonna get -- I have to cook them all up first. - I'm first. - It's not a competition, girls. - It's really a competition? - Yeah, yes. - Remember last time, Kira? I won. - Okay, sit down, please. - I'll win again. - Stop it! - Hey, Callie! - Stop! I -- I'm not doing anything, look. - Look, I'm not fighting. - She's ten! Don't aggravate her. - Callie. No. - Shake hands. Shake hands. Shake hands. Stop. Stop! It's -- get off! - Get off! - Aah! No pulling. - Callie! - I'm fine, Delanee! - She's all mean. - Oh, mommy! - Okay, girls. You guys get your own corners. - You guys go get ready for -- - I call this corner! - Oh, boy. - Of course. - You smacked him. - No, no, no, no. - Did too. - Ha-ha-ha. - So, what's your weight now? - I haven't checked. - Okay. - I have a lot of clothes on now. I'm just gonna keep going for, like, a couple hours and see where I'm at. Well, we don't have a couple of hours. So.. - Let's go. We gotta -- - I'm going. Okay, we gotta pick it up, brother. I can't go -- I don't wanna run any faster. - Okay. - That just builds endurance. - I'm trying to lose weight, so.. - Okay, well. We should've been losing weight three weeks ago. Like I asked. You know what, you don't have to do this at all, man, don't worry. - If you don't want to do it, it's okay. - Joe, Joe. It's okay, alright, If you don't, if -- I'm sayin' if you don't want to do it, it's no big deal.. I'm serious, if you -- if you, like, could.. - I'm tryin' to deal with a lot of stuff right now. - I understand all that. And this week was supposed to be set to lose weight. But a lot of stuff came up, and like I said if, if it's --if it's, if it's embarrassing to you -- It's not embarrassing, it's not, no, it's not that. - It's my fault. - Okay, yeah. But...if we would've done this when I asked you to do it.. I work in a boiler room all day long. I gotta drink water. - I gotta eat. - Okay, man. Just get on the treadmill, we gotta go. What's the matter? Oh, well, if you get sick there's less weight for you to cut. You want to know what separates us from normal people, Joe? This, right here. This is what separates us from normal people. Normal people are on their couch right now watching "South Park." That's what separates us from normal people. One fifty-five point two. What are you weighing? 219. I gotta weigh 210. Perfect. How about here? Quick roll call, Rob Dyer is probably not here. Derrick Brody? - Here. Clayton? I will be posting the line-up tonight on our Facebook page, if you wanna know where you're fighting. Um, depending on who makes weight and who doesn't.. 184.5. 155. 178. Joe Carman. 204.5. You're in. It's show time, bro. Let's get this done. Show this kid who's still the champ. Alright, ladies and gentlemen fighting under the United FC Fighting Team Joe Carman! And at the red corner fighting out of Bellingham MMA Clayton Hoy! Fight! - Come on, Joe! - Cage him up! Bring him in, Joe. Bring him in. Oh, bring it to him! Go left. Set it up. Set it up. Once again, let's put it together for the spectacular Sierra! I'm having a hard time breathing, sorry. Let's get ready for round two, everybody. What do you say? Let's go, Joe. You gotta take him. Take down, Joe. Take.. Take it down. Right. Go left! Set it up. Set it up. Shit! It appears as though we have an inadvertent low blow. Protective gear only goes so far. The fighter gets five minutes to recover up to five minutes to recover. Bring it, Joe. Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe! He's on his feet! Stop! Big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen. Great fight. Great fight. We have our winner at 48 seconds of round number two. The arm triangle choke out of the red corner Clayton Hoy! * I make statues bleed and portraits cry * * I'll go to war for mine * * Rebel army guard the border * * I'm in the trenches barkin' orders * * Like I'm Sergeant Slaughter * * Pray to Jesus * * For mercy and plead your case * * 'Cause on the front lines you're dead * * The second that you see my face ** - Hey. - Hey. Got a scratch, huh? Just a little one. That's not a little scratch, daddy. - It's a little scratch. - No, it isn't. Um, got, uh.. What is that, a cut? - Yeah. A little cut. - That's a good cut. It's a little one. What happened to you promising you wouldn't do this again? And I didn't even find out that you were doing it again. I understand. You don't understand. I'm talking about promises made, Joe. - Can we talk about -- - Promises, promises made. Did you not offer that promise? I, and -- and what I'm asking for is like, just, like, you know, all this-- You're always asking for something. Another chance? Another promise? - No, I'm just saying-- - You don't keep 'em. But I have to stay, right? Because I'm sick, and I have nowhere else to go. So I gotta put up with whatever you want to do and be okay with it. No, I'm not saying that, Nori. I don't understand. Why do you keep wanting to fight? I'm making, like, uh -- uh, I said, about, I -- I'm making -- You don't even make money off of this. You don't make money off of it. You trying to prove something to your dad? No, I just.. What is it, then? You know when people say that, like, you know, when -- when you have like, self It's something to prove to myself because it's the only time that in my life when I, when I feel proud of myself. I feel, I'm proud of you guys. You know, I'm proud that I created you guys. You know, I mean, I'm proud of my family. Of you guys. But the only time I feel, like, a confidence in myself is when I'm fighting. It's the only time that I have that sense that, you know, that.. ...that I like me. It's okay. I don't want you to be like...45 and be in a wheelchair because of an accident or lose your job because of fighting. And you can't work. I don't want to give it up but I'm going to give it up. I have to give it up, because it's -- - But you're not. - I'm going to. You just did a fight, and you got hurt. You said.. You said if you got hurt, you would quit. I got a black eye. It's not hurt. It is. It could have been something worse. What if I make you a promise right now, that I'll.. I'm going to stop for you guys. - I'm going to stop for the family. You usually don't keep your promises. * I've been working see * * I've been working see * * I've been working see * * I I've been working * I've been working see * * Listen see * Could my dad come? 'Cause he comes to all my appointments. Of course. As long as you're fine with it. No, yeah, because I forget things and he'll remember things I forget, so.. So, things started really going downhill about two years ago. Yeah, I had, like a lung infection that was.. And a chronic cough, and flu and they thought I had shingles because, like, my whole body just was on fire you know, my skin and everything. Yeah, the memory stuff started, like, two years ago, too, so. But it's been getting progressively worse the last two years. I seem to stump everyone. Everyone is like, "I don't know what's wrong with you. Something is wrong with you, we just don't know what." You alright? - It's, you know, I get those sharp pains. It's just.. My whole right side of my body, I told you it's just been stupid lately. Oh, my God. - I mean, I, I get it. - You saw it. It's clear that he threw everything he had. And everybody's, like, going, "Oh! When he hit you in the gut, you stopped." I go, "What are you talkin' about? I came right at him after he hit me." I never stopped going forward the entire time. - Either I moved or moved forward. - Right. Until he hit me in the crotch, then, and I was like going, this is really tender right now. I don't want no one to come near me. I remember looking at the cage and looking out through the holes at people and they're, like, going, "Ooh." Yeah. And then, not even like, probably 15 minutes later he posts a picture, like, saying, "Total domination." What the fuck fight were you fighting that you think you totally dominated me? It's like he thinks he's this, I'm, like, going "You're a fucking amateur fighter. You're shit. You're nothing." So, I'm working on a, a rematch between you and Clayton. - 'Cause I don't think he's stronger than you. - I think it's all show. Yeah, I don't think, I don't think he's stronger than you. You know, I think he's just a, he's a smotherer. During that fight, I wasn't at the potential that I could have been at, so when you.. A lot of fights you kind of think about and think about, and think about, you ever done that before? And you just, you can't get it out of your head? Yeah. I tell people this all the time, right it's like we're all.. something has to be wrong with us. Us, because, I -- I get what you're saying when you, when you don't want to quit. I get it. I -- I tell everybody, uh, fighters fighters are like strippers. You know. They're cool to hang out with, they're cool to party with they're cool to freakin' do whatever with, man but other than that, that's it. I mean, but, like strippers, dude, we all have mental issues, we all have some kind of addiction. We all have, you know we just gotta...you know. Mommy didn't love us. Daddy touched us too much. You know what I mean, I don't know what the hell it drives but there's, there's easier ways to do things. And every stripper has an expiration date. Yeah. And they're single parents. And I'm a huge fan of supporting the single mother movement. So, you're gonna fight this Clayton guy again? Well, again. What -- - Okay, so what if you lose to him again? - Then, it's done. No, you're just going to be thinking about it again. No, because that's, that's, you lose twice at something, I mean, it, it.. I wasn't at the level that I usually train at. I just, I'm, this is a new one for me, again because the last time we talked, you said, aah -- I know, I -- I don't want to argue, I don't want to fight, but you know -- But you're gonna do what you want. And that's that. So.. But I just.. I need to close that book. You need. I know. It's fine. There's no point in having a conversation with you because you're going to do what you want anyway. - That's not true. - It is true. Because you said you were done with Clayton, and all of a sudden you're not, right? How many times have you done that to me? We make a decision, I think you're.. You say, "Yeah, that's a great idea." And then you go and do whatever you want because, "That's what I had to do, Nori. You just don't understand." Then why did you agree with me in the first place? Because I thought I could just agree with you and move forward. How many times have you said, "This is my last fight. "Hey, this is my last fight. "Just, just kiddin'. Next fight is my last fight. "Wait. One more fight, one more fight. "I have to redeem myself. "Wait, one more fight. I need closure. Wait, one more fight." It's.. You know? Okay. How are you feelin'? - I'm okay. Not right now. Think positive thoughts. Don't let this head mess with you so the stomach starts hurting, okay? Mm-hm. - Okay. Come and get it. Come on. Anybody have will call tickets Will call. And in the red corner the reigning Ax Champion Clayton Hoy! Fight! Go! Go! Go! Go! That's it! How're you feeling overall? Um, I'm just trying to get, figure out um, how to get rid of this dizziness. I have, like, these, like, times when it comes and goes. Where if I get up real fast I, it's off-balance. - Right. - Um.. It feels like, there's, like, like vertigo kinda kickin' in. So, I'm trying to figure out how do we stop that from happening. Okay, and stand up normal. Now, head back. When your head's back, I want you to turn right and stay there. Back and right. - And turn.. Turn your head to the right at the same time as going back, and if there's no pain -- - Whoa. Okay. - Stand up, oh.. You're losing some balance there? Yeah, one second. One second, one second. Okay. That's fine. - Okay. - Okay. So that makes you lose some balance doing that. How much do you think this is caused from... my choices of...competing? It -- it's hard to say. So, um, there are a number of things that can go on with concussion that can cause balance difficulties. Uh, there's also things that can go on with trauma to the head so at this point, the question is is this actually moving into something called post-concussion syndrome? Family history of any conditions that could be related or genetic? My father's, uh.. Uh, he likes to drink. Okay, would you say he suffers from alcoholism? - I'd say yeah. - Okay. That, and, um, slight bipolar. Okay. - And depression. - Mm-hm. Get down. You are dead! - Dad! - Yeah. Dad. - Not hard enough yet. You're not squeezing hard enough yet. Okay, what? You're not squeezing hard enough yet. Yes, I am! You sound weird. No, not yet. There we go. Daddy! - Chicken strips. Hi. I was trying to get it off of my panda. Girls, hurry up. Get -- get packed up. We gotta go. If we're late, your mom's gonna be angry. - Yup. Dad, you don't look very happy. - I'm not very happy. - I know. Your mom's gonna be really angry. 'Cause I'm dropping you guys off late. Oh, gosh, she's in the red Jeep. - Okay. - Yeah. That sucked. Delanee just sent me a text. It says, "Callie is already arguing with my mom. She can be so mean sometimes." Well, I just.. I get tired of the BS. It's been too many years, and.. Can't expect her to change because she doesn't think she needs to. They gotta deal with the fallout between me and her. - Dad, I'll spray you. - No, no, no. I'm good. - Rinse off. - I'm good. I'm good. - I'm good, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.. - Shower. - I really am good. Kira, come on! - No, I'm good. - Kira! Daddy, you need to spray it like me. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. You just killed whatever bugs were on me. You just killed all your make-up! My make-up! Don't touch it, don't touch it. Dry it off, mommy. I can't. I can't touch it. It's gonna dry. Aw, man, Mia. And now, it's like this.. No, it's not, don't touch it! - Don't touch it! - Daddy! You sprayed yourself. - Aw, it's okay, baby. - It's okay, come here. - It's okay. - It's okay. You just, you forgot. It's okay. I'm not mad at you. What's wrong? - She looks upset. - It's okay. - Here, just don't touch it, it'll dry. - We took good pics. It'll dry. It's not smeared. Oh, Lord, have mercy. Let me see it. Let me see it. Let me see it. It's not gone. Yeah, it is. I looked at it. I'm looking at it right now, come here. No. I know it's gone! - You used water! - Mia, come on. We'll dab it. We'll dab it, okay? Okay? It'll be fine. - Okay. You knew she was gonna freak out and you were like, "Ooh it's smearing down your face now." She sprayed water on herself! Knee-ride. Come on, fearless leader. Bring it in. Guys, very good job today. Super loud, united on three. - One, two, three! - United! Good job, guys. Hey, Joe, I thought we were getting ready to do some sit-ups. I got served papers, so that's why I've been really stressed out today, so.. What'd you get served papers for? My ex-wife, she wants to move to Spokane and she wants to take Callie and Delanee out with her. That's why I've been really depressed, so.. So.. What're you gonna do, man? I don't know. I'm trying just to focus on the fight. I was working out, and here, this guy, he says "Hey, Joe Carman?" I was, like, going, "Yeah." I thought he was a new client coming in. He's, like, going, "You've been served." I go, "Huh?" And I was like going "Oh, that's nice." Everything changed all at once. Okay. That sucks, but we have a task at hand. - I know. Right now, try to, as much as it sucks I know, i -- it, it's, it's easier said than done. Try to put it out of your mind, and let's focus on the task at hand. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Hi. - Hey. Well, not your -- not your mouth, your hand. Nope. Shake hands. Like that. It's still okay to make it steamy. This is terrible. This is so terrible. I want to see. Can you show me afterward? Question. If you do move, what're you guys gonna do? There's nothing over there, nothing. If they leave you, and you guys are there by yourself.. What's gonna happen? Callie, well, you know.. Like, uh, she gets like, kind of a shell around her. That's my concern. When I was growing up, I didn't feel like I fit in a lot with a lot of people around me. But you're Big Joe. Everybody likes you. Yeah, but it wasn't like that. I became more, um, enclosed. And built more walls up. I became destructive. And that's why I got a lot of fights. But what I don't want to happen is I don't want you to be like me. Get it up, Joe, come on! Above your head. Ten more seconds, Joe. Don't let it fall. Don't let it fall. Five more seconds. Come on, get it up. Come on, go. Go. Come on, Joe. If this song doesn't make you wanna piggyback a man around in a hot room nothing will. That's right. Sweet Jesus, Joe! Suck into him, Sebastian. All the way to the wood, Joe. - Come on, Joe. - Let's go. Joe, come on. Joe, let's go! Let's go, come on, man! Let's get up, come on. All you gotta do is crawl across the mat, let's go. Joe, let's go! What looks more impressive at the end of a round? Somebody who raises their hands and is all excited.. ...or somebody who falls over? Joe, get up! Sebastian, roll him over, please. Goddammit! Un-fuckin'-real. Could you.. Let me see his lips. Are you feeling pale? - No. - He's just overheated. His lips are blue too. If you can get him some sugar so his glucose levels are dropped.. So, just get him some sugar. Gatorade? - Yeah. Yeah. Gatorade is actually really good. Yeah. Take your Gatorade. Again, more fuckin' fluid we gotta get out of your system. You know? Come on. Joe, I know you want this fight. But I would like for you to have a couple of more fights under your belt before we take this fight with Clayton. You're just not ready yet. So.. Okay. My family is gonna kill me. Yeah. You have to drop down weight? Probably. So three fights, where? Well, around here, locally, probably. Why didn't you tell us about it? I didn't, I.. What happens if you get hurt? No, no, no, no, no, no. Mia, Mia, Mia. Mia. Only Callie and I. Only Callie and I. - No, let me go. - Only Callie. - Me too. - Mia, go. - Can I just -- - I mean it. Cal! Mia! I just need to talk to Callie for a minute. - I wanna talk to her too. - Okay, well. Just a minute. Mia, I'm serious. I'm trying to have a talk with Callie. I'm talking, too. I'll just sit here and watch. - Again, he lied. - Okay, I know, but.. He wants to do three more fights and then go pro with Clayton. He said one! Yeah, he just said he's, he's doing three. I thought he said he's not going to fight anymore. No, he's doing three more fights and then he wants to fight Clayton again. Why? Do you like that he lied to us? He's still your dad. You know? I know that. I'm not saying I don't love him. You, you don't have to argue and stuff. - It's okay. - I don't.. No, it's not okay. Mia, you don't understand. I actually do understand. Yeah, but when you bring up that-- Callie, you're gonna just bring it up at home. And then, mommy is gonna get all angry at daddy and they're gonna be in a big fight. And mommy says next time she's gonna leave the house with -- and go to grandpa's. I don't want to do it anymore! I don't want that to happen either but it's not our fault. He caused this. I'm not trying to blame him. - I'm just saying -- - But you're just gonna bring it up at home. I'm not trying to make it a big deal. I don't want them to fight, but -- You're going to make 'em. I'm not going to make them fight. Just, like.. I can't drop this. - Well, don't drop it. - Don't drop it! Just don't bring it up while we're at home. - Please! - That's the only time that I can bring it up. You guys are just, like, "Oh, well, you know What -- what's ever happening is happening." I don't think we can really do anything about it when we probably can do something about it. - We can talk to him. - We can't, Callie! - It's his, it -- it's him. - Try to change his mind. He can do whatever he wants. - Yeah, but -- - He doesn't listen to us. I know, that's why I want to bring it up to make it clear. But I don't want to. And I don't want -- And you don't have to. But why do you have to bring it up at home? I don't think this is ever gonna end. Hi, daddy. I'm, I'm not feelin' too hot today. Joe's got a stupid fight, so.. And I'm just being a grouchy bitch, so.. Yeah. I do hurt 24-7. I'm just sick of hurtin' him. And I'm sick of being trapped here. I'm sick of fucking Joe doing whatever the fuck he wants. And...you know I'm just sick, and I'm stuck here with all his mess, and fuckin' goats. I'm just...pissed off. Yeah, I don't like myself much. Yeah. I'm just tired. Tap! It's over! Look like a warrior. The winner via submission in armbar give it up for Joe Carman! You got the win, dude! Yeah! - That was a good fight, man. - Thank you. I've never been to one before. This was awesome. Nice job. Hope it was exciting for you guys to watch. - It really was. - Hey, great fight, man. Oh, thank you. Appreciate it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Appreciate it. - Yeah. - Forty. Can I take a picture with you? Oh, yeah. Alright, Joe. You ready? Alrighty. There you go. Thank you. I know. - I'm okay. - No. Am I allowed to talk to them I just want to see how she's doing. How is she going to receive that? Oh, okay. Alright, we're back on the record with respect to clause number 013039460. This is a relocation case where Miss Haverfield is seeking to move her family to Stevens County. And Mr. Carman is opposing the move. There is evidence that was produced in trial that showed that Mrs. Haverfield really is dependable, consistent and involved in every aspect of the girls' daily needs. Mr. Carman is in a different situation. He works for the ferry system and he has his gym. Uh, that makes him a very busy man. Now, and on top of that he has two other children and a wife, and a family that he's, uh, managing. I think this factor favors relocation because of the girls' strong connection with their mother. Her constant and dependable presence in their lives. So, I'm going to allow it. Okay. It's going -- it's going to be okay. Did they call her out on her being a liar? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'll come down, when I come down and talk to you we'll get more details of it. But right now, it -- it -- - Alright. - Alright. Don't cry, relax. We'll be alright. - Okay. Alright, I love you. - Bye. - Bye. Yup. Well.. - I'm sorry, baby. - It's alright. - Just you by yourself in the courtroom today? - Yeah. So it wouldn't have done any -- wouldn't have done any good if we were there, anyhow. You're right, dad, there would have been no advantage at all. Well, if I had known.. - I told you guys. - He told us. - But he, we probably -- - Months in advance. - We probably forgot. - Well, okay. And what would've been, what would've been the advantage? We were going to say positive things about Joe. Okay, so, just, her, they're saying positive things about her. We could've said something positive about Joe. - Yes. - Okay. And we weren't there to say it. Okay. A month before that, we should've sat down and planned. Two months before in advance.. - You should've came over. - I gave you a li.. - Yeah, he did. - We should've sat down and planned a strategy. Two months, two months before the court case - I gave her the list of things to talk about. - He did, he did. There was a topic conversation to talk about. You know it happened, 'cause the attorney gave it to you! The attorney gave you a list. - Yes, I printed it out. - They gave her a list of talking points. They go, "This is a talking point for your father. - This is a talking point for your mother." - Okay. He goes, "Who's coming?" I go, "None." Just agree that we haven't done it, that's all. I'm saying, we have not done it as much as we could. Because we got caught up in our own life! Yeah. - I'm saying, I didn't -- - So we are guilty. I'm not saying guilt.. I'm not using -- We are, we are. No, we are. Guilty is that you did something wrong. - No, we are. - You did! - Stanley, we are. - You did something wrong! It's just another one of those subjects all through the years, Joe where something has occurred, and now, you gotta go from here. Your mom's admitting this I don't recall, and you're disappointed. And you don't think anybody in the family cares. - They don't! - And so there's nothing I can say to you. Okay, all we can do is apologize and he's already kicked down enough. Why don't we just stop here? - I don't want to do this. - Okay. - And, you know, I feel really bad. - I feel horrible, too. Then, how come you don't admit to nothing then, dad? Then, just, you know, admit that we, we, you know we haven't done it, because we haven't. Okay, well, I don't like the idea of being misconstrued like we don't care. It isn't about caring, it's we haven't made the time. Well, that's the implication. "You did this, you did that you didn't show up for this I can't count on you." I mean, this is all negative pessimistic garbage. - I don't need to hear this at all. - Stan, okay. He went to court, and he could've maybe got a better deal if we would have at least been there to. - We didn't. We didn't. - I don't, I don't even care about the deal. - That's what led to it. - I don't even care about the deal. You know what I wanted? The support! I mean, I've, I've heard the stories about how you got supposedly kicked out of the house when you were just a teenager. Off on your own. All fallacies, fallacies everywhere, Joe. I wasn't living over at different people's houses. You did this all on your own. You created all this yourself. What'd you say to me? You revolted against this family. You said, "Get out of this house. - Quit causing problems. " - No, I didn't. Don't even, don't even go there, Joe. You didn't say that, dad? - You ran away, Joe. - Stan! Nobody kicked you out of the house. Something, a switch turned on your head. - And you were anti-family. - Stan. For many years, many years. You don't want to keep going there. - You really don't. - Go ahead, keep going! Stan, please stop! - You're going to say-- - I don't want to do it. - You're going to say-- - You're bothering me! You take no responsibility for any of this. I'm saying you gotta stop candy-coating your life where you're, like, such a great big, wonderful person. - I never do. - When you're really not. - Okay, stop! No more. - It's total manipulation. - Oh, my God. - The big, the big hero. - The big everything. - Stanley, stop! - I'm tired of it. - Mom. - I'm tired of it. Stan? Don't leave, Joe. He thinks he's perfect. I know, I know. Just do it for me. - Please. - Yup. Will you just make peace? Just make peace. How many times have I made peace? I know. Just one more time. How many times have I made peace? Just, just do it, please. Please. Please. There is a young man. Slightly unshaven. Let's see, there's, Dave's over there. Dave's tent. Mike's and Joe's. I see an orange tent, a gray one and some.. Somebody just asked me what am I doing. Let's see if we can find that person. - Joe. - With long hair. We're not sure who this individual is, but.. Come on, come on. Shut up, let's play Frisbee. - Let's play Frisbee. Hey, I want to play with that Frisbee. Let's go! - Oh! - Oh, my God, that hurt. Fun! Wait! Wait, wait. I'm going in, mommy. Kira, stand up, baby. Come on, girls, let's go. I gotta stop by the gym on the way home. Yes, yeah, this was, uh, thrown together real quick but I want the guys to get some experience, so.. Just real quick getting 'em in so. - Awesome. - Thank you. Show-off! When did you grow so tall? I don't know, I'm taller than Delanee! - I know. Yeah. I'm a little taller than Delanee. You're almost as tall as Callie. - Get down! - Hey. - Down, Kira. - I think you are. She's gonna get ya. Pretty soon. No, I'm going to be as tall as him. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. No, you're not. And here comes her, here comes her oppo-- No, it's my turn. So the girls are still all livin' with you? Yeah, my ex-wife, she can't move for a while so I've got them a little longer. Kira Carman! She weighs a hundred pounds. And let's get ready to rumble! Callie takes Kira down from the throne. Callie is blocking! Girl fight. Go ahead. Kira, get her. Kira, come on, come on! Come on, Kira, turn! Yeah, turn it! Turn, turn, turn, turn.. Yeah! Ah, don't pull her hair. No hair pulling! No hair pulling! Okay, here we go, girls, good job. Yay! Good job, guys. Turn. Turn. She's giving me an evil look. Come here, come here, stop, stop, stop, okay? Ah, ah, we don't cry. We don't cry, alright? - Mm-hm. You did a good job, alright? Heads up. Head up. Good? Okay. - Yeah. Do you think I could come to one of your fights? I think it would be great. You know, I'd love to see you guys in there to watch the fight. But I know how much you guys were totally against it at first. So, I just want you, I don't want you to get your hopes up and expect to see something that.. You know what I mean? What are you doin', Callie What? Who's that? - No. - Oh, my God. He's scary-looking. Don't fight him. Daddy, don't fight him. - He's.. - That's fake. - That's so Botox. - Yeah, yeah. That's botoxed? Alright, ladies and gentlemen we are going to get started in a couple of minutes over here. Get your mind right, buddy. Brush that shit off. Let's do it, man! Do it, man, let's do it! Blue corner to the ring, please! Let's go! Come on! Good Effort! Come on, daddy! Come on, daddy! - Come on, daddy! - Mia, it's okay, it's okay. Mia, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah! The winner in the first round, Rodriguez! Oh, shit. Squeeze it in there. Can you do it? - No, okay, no. I probably could have kept going, but.. ...I couldn't, I couldn't really I couldn't, um, I couldn't see him. It was spinning, really. No, I can't go in there. I hear it in your voice. You're not really there. Does the cold water feel good on your head? No, I don't even feel it. You don't even feel it? Real smart. What were you thinking, taking them to the fight? You know, I can't rely on you to take care of this family because you do stupid shit. You said you wanted to raise your kids differently not how you were raised, but look what you're doing. I'm being supportive for you, too and trying right now to deal with your situation. Deal with my situation? I'll fucking leave then. - You won't have to -- - But where you gonna live? I'll just go live with my grandma or something. And then you're going to just leave the kids? No, they're comin'. That's what you want? I've been dealing with you and your situation since we got married. - If you don't want to be with me, then leave. - Fine. You don't wanna be a part of me? You don't wanna be -- - Don't wanna be a part of me? - No, no, no. You don't want to be a part of me? - You don't wanna be.. You don't ever want to fucking be here. - You'd rather do anything than be here. Because this is what I get. Ask them if they want to be around you. Ask them. Ask them if they want to be around you. They'll say all the time. "We don't want to be with mommy. "We don't want to be with mommy. We can't take her. She always yells. She always screams. She's always mad at us." I'm leaving, so it doesn't matter. - Mommy, please don't. - You're coming with me. Mommy, I want to stay. I want -- Daddy won't be around. You're gonna be by yourself. Keep goin', Joe, you're forty years old with a freakin' head injury. Keep goin'. I'm so sorry. Can I go with you? You sure? Okay. I love you. - Dad. - Daddy, see. - You've got a lot of Christmas presents. Watching Christmas stuff. Initially, like, when I initially saw you fight I saw you fight Anacortes. - Right. - That was when the first time I saw you fight. - Yeah. - And I was like, "Wow, Clayton Hoy!" And I talked to Charlie, I was, like, listen, I really want to fight. He's, like, going, "Why?" I go, "He just looks ex -- he's.." - You're like, look exciting. - Yeah. You're like an extreme exciting fight. - So, that's why I really wanted to play. - Yeah. That's a fighter's mindset. That's not like, I'm going to take that fight because I know I can beat that dude up. It's like, I'm going to take that fight because that's going to be a fuckin' fight. Oh, yeah, 'cause, like, all my training that I've been doing for the last, like, years has been about you. I was like, going, what can I do to train to -- to be better at this? Well, we can still make it happen. - I know, that's.. - I'm here right now. - I'm here for a few months. Yeah. And I'm pretty flexible right now. - And everything I have fits in the duffel bag. Yeah, all my shit is down in Vegas and I'm just kinda wingin' it right now. - Uh.. Uh, temporarily. So, Jessica and I are splitting up. - Yeah, I know. - Um.. - If you don't mind me asking. Yeah, it's... it's nothing like there's not one thing that really did it but at this point, she just doesn't really want me anymore. - Yeah, it's weird, man. - Wow. It's like I hit a reset button on my life. I showed up here, I had an expired license. - I didn't have insurance. I didn't have a phone. - That's crazy. I didn't have any money in a bank account that I could use. - 'Cause it's shared. - Yeah. Yeah, so, I, uh, so, I just have some cash and some clothes that smell like fish and diesel. So, I went out. The onl.. The clothes I'm wearing, they're like my only new clothes that are acceptable to be in public. Bought some new shoes today. And, uh, yeah. Uh, it is, it's, it's just weird how you see when you say these things to me because in my head, I picture Clayton Hoy, like a different life. - Yeah. - Like, you know, just, like.. I -- I always pictured like, you know.. ...just on top of the world. Yeah. - You know, like -- - I just, I just feel like a kid still, man. Yeah. I've had, like, a lot of, like, stuff going on, like, like yourself.. - Yeah. - With, like, just life and stuff. With the kids, and with the wife. With the job. And I, one thing I kept tellin' myself was, like I've been wondering a lot about, was, like.. What's the most important thing to me? You know what I mean? I was able to go and step into the cage with you once. Maybe sometime in the future, I do it again. Right now, because of my kids, because of the wife right now.. - Just your situation. - I can't do it right now. Yeah. No, man, I get it. So, now, I gotta focus on them versus anything else right now. Yeah, and that's what you should do. - You know, it really is.. - It sucks. It sucks, but that's the right thing to do. I know, that's what I'm saying, like, it's hard to say.. Like, right now, when do you know when you're done? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, when do you know when, like, yeah.. I, I can tell people all the time. How do you, how do you call it? - Alright. - Cheers, man! Yeah. I turned it down. You're happy for that? What's Delanee doin'? For now, we're just gonna work on ones. So, here.. Chin. Both hands up. Go one. One. One. Your power's actually comin' from your front. Your front is what, it's all your power, that's why in a fight people will do this and kick the front leg. Because if they keep kicking your front leg then, your power goes away. You wanna move, or you wanna keep flowin'? When I first started, I was like, a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot. Joe must break. That's all you need, it's all about being in control, relaxed. There you go! There you go! Get that.. Yeah, yeah! - Go, go, go, go. - Keep going. Nice job. - Nice job, good job. - Good job. - Good job, guys. - Good job. Go. - Hi, daddy. - Hello. - Bye, girls. - Bye. - No more, no more. - Come on, Mia. No more. Get her! Ram into her. - No slapping! - Ow. Ugh, come on, Mia! And don't ever give up! I got you gloves. - These gloves are my gloves? - Yeah. Yay! - Wait, these are only, like, practice? - Yep. - Okay. And then, like, the real ones are, like, only.. Small ones, yeah, so, when you get better at punchin' I'll get you the other ones. Okay. So, you've been saying how you want to train, right? Yeah. John, Dakota. Sarah. There you go. You'll need some tape. Bring it up. Perfect. Two more. Here, right there. Because now, and, you know, whenever you're fighting you're always going to bring your shoulders up. And your chin down. Good job. Okay, so here, I'm gonna come here. Out, and right back. Cool. Out, and right back. One, and as I come back, two. * This world * This world * Is all in my hands * Is all in my hands * This world * Is all in my hands * Is all in my hands * This world * Is all in my hands * Is all in my hands * This world * Stay close * This world * This world * Stay close *
