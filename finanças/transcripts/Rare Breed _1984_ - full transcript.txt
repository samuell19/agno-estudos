[bright music] [soft music] [indistinct chattering] [bell rings] [crowd cheering] [hooves rumbling] [soft music] [indistinct chattering] [auctioneer blabbering] [gentle music] - I found a horse. [auctioneer blabbering] Why'd you stop? - Well, because we agreed on a limit. - But I could see it in her eyes. She wasn't goin' no higher. - Honey, a limit is a limit. Now, you can get carried away with the excitement of these auctions. - My granddad used to tell me the first money you make on a horse is at an auction. - Yeah. - My stomach tells me it's time for breakfast. - [Announcer] All right, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the auction for today. - I found a horse. - Honey, the auction is over. - But there's one left. - Buckingham Farms here are offering for sale just a truly fine and gracious young filly. - I told you, that's her. - Honey, we are hungry. - You told me to watch and learn. Well, I watched and learned, and that's a damn good filly. A damn good filly. - [Announcer] Research clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. - Always wanted to see a damn good filly. - You wait. She's beautiful. - The name of this filly is Carnauba. She is a great filly and it's really too bad we didn't get her in the catalog. She is sired by No Home II, and she is out of Carnival Queen. - Hey, not bad, baby. - And Carnival Queen- - I told you, didn't I? - [Man] Remember is the high spirit of Margo. - [Auctioneer] All right. Lot number 59- - She's learning. [auctioneer blabbering] - I'm not seeing a lot of quality. We regret that she's came in out of the catalog and as an extra lot, but don't penalize her that much, fellas. And we'll have 25,000, 26,000 in honor. [auctioneer blabbering] - Sold to Nathan Hill, Dallas, Texas. - Well, he's not the only one who knows how to signal a bid. He may have his cigarettes, but I've got my glasses. - Oh, thank you. - [Announcer] All right. Thank you. - Hey, don't forget. She's your responsibility. - [Announcer] And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the sale for today. - You know, she don't hear a damn thing I tell her. God, I wish she'd grow up. By the way, thanks. - For what? I always wanted to own a damn good filly. [dramatic music] [horse whinnying] [Anne laughs] - You know why God made that horse's head so big? - No. Why? - Put all the dumb in. - Are you sure your daddy said for us to be doing this? - I know this horse, Henry. Trust me. - But your daddy says she don't take kind to weight on the back. Billy Bob been trying for six weeks. - Billy Bob never did know how to treat a lady. Trust me, Henry. - I trust you, Ms. Anne. I just don't want your daddy puttin' old Henry out the graves if you're wrong. - Henry. Isn't that Carnauba? - The same. - Well, didn't Jess say she wouldn't... - Mm-hmm. Said Billy Bob don't know how to handle a lady. Can't wait till that gets around. [gentle music] - Got it, girl. Come on. Easy, girl. Easy. Got it, girl. Don't grab her. That's a girl. Come on. Okay. Come on, girl. Easy. Okay, Henry. Let her get used to it now. Got it, girl. Easy. [horse whinnying] Easy, girl. Don't hold her face. Easy, girl. - Mr. Hill? - Uh-oh, Ms. Anne. Father's coming. - Mr. Hill. - It'll be all right, Henry. - Like hell it is, Ms. Anne. Your daddy's gonna bust my butt. - Easy, girl. Come on. Oh, girl. Easy. Easy, girl. There we go. [horse whinnying] [ominous music] Okay. Let me have her, I got her. Oh, easy, girl. Easy, girl. Easy. Easy, oh. Easy, girl. - I'll be damned. - Easy, girl. Oh. Ho, ho. Easy, girl. That's it. Easy. Come on, ho. That's it, girl. That's a good girl. Easy. Okay, nice and slow. Easy, girl. Easy, girl. Good girl. See, that wasn't so hard now, was it? - You must be Luigi. I'm Nathan Hill. - Yes, sir. - Glad to see you. - Easy. - What the hell do you think you're doing? [horse whinnying] [dramatic music] - Well, that was some ride. - You know something? You are still not too big for me to tan your breaches. - I just wanted to prove that- - I know what you wanted. I'll tell you something. I got a lot of men on this farm that I pay good money to break horses. It's not a job for my daughter. - But did you see her? - I saw her. And I saw something else. I saw a very foolish young lady trying to break her neck. And I don't ever want to see you do a damn foolish thing like that again. I'm gonna tell you something else. She can run like a bat outta hell. - I told you, didn't I? Did you see her, Nathan? Did you? Oh, excuse me. But anyway, she needs a hot down. I mean, a rub down. Henry. - We'll go back with you, baby. [gentle music] - [Nathan] Jess, this is Luigi Nelson. - Lou is just fine. - Lou trains horses for his father. They got the Kalina stable right outside of Milan. - Ah! - I promised them five two-year-olds for the coming season. And the Kentucky Derby winner over there is Jess's daughter, Anne. - Hi. - I'm afraid I thought you were a boy at first. - Yeah, well, don't feel guilty. I haven't seen her in a dress since the day she was christened. [laughs] - Well, how about if I show you around a little bit, huh? - Good idea. - I'll show you where the bar is, huh? [gentle music] - Take your pick. - That one over there. The bay, what's her name? - Bay... - Carnauba? But you can't. She's hardly broken yet. - Well, I tell you she's got possibilities, but she looks like she could be trouble. - Trouble. - I'm sure I can handle her. - Anne, I promised his father, he could have any five horses he wants. If he wants Carnauba, I'm afraid he's got her. - But it's not fair, daddy. She's mine. - Honey, honey, honey. - But she's mine. - She is not yours. That's Nathan's horse. And he's given his word. - But I've been responsible. - I know. Yeah. Get outta here. Let me take care of this. Get. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come between you and your daughter. - Believe me, nobody can do that. - Lou, are you sure you won't change your mind? - No, sir. I don't think so. - Well, like I said, got the makings of a good race horse. - Come on, I'll buy you a drink? [upbeat music] I remember right after the war, we bought up all of the best bloodstock in Europe. Things haven't been the same since. That's why I think it's time for us to reinvest some of our talents over there. I told Luigi and his father, they could race any five two-year-olds I got. Well, you talk about having a good eye for horses, he picked my five best right off the top. [upbeat music] [all clapping] - Hey, I was hoping to see your daughter before I left. - Oh, don't let it worry you. - I just thought if I get to talk to her, she might understand. - I know, but she's gotta learn like everybody else. You got to take your best shot. I got one, look at that. I got an empty. - And I can always come and see you. [gentle music] Oh, I know it won't be as easy as here, but Italy's not so far away. Well, maybe it's not that close, but dad's right. This could be your big chance. I mean, you'll have the best of everything. Oh, I know it won't be the same, but just think, you can be the hottest thing in San Siro. You just gotta promise to be good. No more stepping on people's toes or laying down after they've cleaned you up. Oh, you can step on that old Luigi Nelson's toes anytime you want. - I wanna thank you for being such an honorable man. - You give your father my best regards. Tell him I want some winners. - Will do. Again, I'm sorry about your daughter. - Hey, don't worry about it. We just figured it'd be a little better if she made herself a little scarce. She's at that awkward age, you know? - [Luigi] Well, tell her I'll take good care of her horse. - Well, I know, she knows that. - These trailers will load directly on the airplane, so that shouldn't be much of a problem. With any luck at all, you'll be out of this cold weather and back in Milan in 12 hours. - Well, thanks for all your help with the arrangements. I'm sure we'll make out fine. - [Nathan] Okay, Lou. - When you come to Milan, you know where to stay. Jess. - Good trip. [gentle music] - [Luigi] Yes, we found her. She claims she was kidnapped by Bolshevik revolutionaries. No, she's fine. - I just wanted to be with my horse. - That's enough. Your father and Mr. Hill both agree you've caused quite enough trouble for the time being. Your dad suggested a good tanning. I think getting skinned alive would be more like it. Your little adventure has cost me 16 hours and filling out police forms and answering questions, not to mention the fact I haven't had any sleep the last two and a half days. - Would it help to say I'm sorry? - [Luigi] No, it would not. - I didn't think so. - Then there's the question of a passport. You, my dear are an illegal alien, a wetback. This country has very strong feelings against wetbacks. I had to do some very fancy talking to get us all out of a lot of trouble. You are no longer a wetback. This is a work visa. - A work visa? - [Luigi] That's right, for work. You ever heard of that? You're grooming my stables. - You mean I can stay? - You love the horse that much, your dad said it would be okay. But there are conditions. - Anything. - You work hard. - I promise. - Finish your schooling. - Promise. - And your dad says, you wear a dress. - What? Wait a minute. He says what? - You object? - No, it just sort of slipped out. I always did look good in pink. [gentle music] [horse whinnying] One more crack like that and I'm gonna cut your oats in half. - [Luigi] Morning. - Morning. - That's very nice. - It's not too good for cleaning out stables. - I do tend to see your point. I'll tell you what, let's make a deal between us. For your father's sake, you wear dresses at meals and at school. And for Carnauba's sake, well, we don't wanna make her adjustments any harder. - I'll be right back. - And now, let's see if you can move as fast. Huh, baby? - How's she doing Romano? - It'll be harder to lose with this one. - You mean we finally got a horse you'd be willing to bet on? - My bookie, he's gonna love this horse. - Did I hear you say kilometer? Isn't that pushing a little too much. - She's strong. I wanna find out how strong. - Don't forget, she's just a two-year-old. [dramatic music] - Wasn't she wonderful? Wasn't she? - She was every bit that, young lady and more so. So, a father has a hard time letting go. [both laugh] - Come on. [gentle music] - Did you get your bets down? - All we could afford. It means the book maker called our kitchen sink non-negotiable. - That's funny. He took mine. - Well, it looks like our only problem is number five, Regatta. She's run second to the last two times out. - [Frank] She's an even money favorite. - It just means better odds for us. - Provided we win. - We're gonna win, all right. I never pick a loser. - They're at the post. [crowd cheering] [announcer speaking in foreign language] - Come on! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] - Beautiful, baby. Well, what's next? - Nathan, that's we wanna talk to you about? - All right. - She's very strong. I wanna give her a couple of more races, and enter her in the Criterium di Roma. - Isn't that against colts? - Mr. Hill, you wanted winners. It's my intention to have Carnauba ready to win the Fred Darling Stakes in England at the end of her three-year-old season. - Fred Darling's open to all ages. No filly has ever won it. - I won't race her unless she's healthy. - Two things my daddy told me. One was you don't change horses in the middle of a stream and you never quit a winner. You keep her in the money, I've got no call to question you, have I? - No. You haven't. [soft music] - Hello. Hello, Anne. Listen to this. Congratulations on recent victory. Stop. Fred Darling entry fee paid. Stop. Ship Carnauba quickest way to England. Stop. We'll join you there. Stop. Jess sends best to Anne. Stop. Regards, Nathan Hill. - That's it. That's great. That's wonderful. Let me see that. Papa, you'll come with me? - Too cold. You go. Of course, take Anne here and her father will be there. But you only got two weeks. You gotta think about shipping her off as soon as you can. She'll need time to adjust. - It's all set for tomorrow. [upbeat music] - Hi. - Hi, honey. [upbeat band music] [crowd applauding] - You know what your dad told me? Told me you graduated with top honors. - You know how dad lies. - Not all the time. Anyway, here's a belated graduation present. - Oh, thank you. I got the best two dads in the world. [gentle bugle music] [crowd cheering] - [Announcer] And still Home Maker by three parts of a length, followed closely by Monsieur Beaucoup and Irish Glad. And now Insensible is along the outside, turning to the back stretch to lead first quarter in a brisk fight between two and four. It's Insensible on the lead with Monsieur Beaucoup still running second. Irish Glad and Home Maker matches one. This one is the long rails as Carnauba pulls up to six. Still brisk down to the foil as they button to the far turn. It's Insensible now holding up a two-length lead. And Monsieur Beaucoup, Irish Glad and Home Maker. [upbeat music] Carnauba now [indistinct] heads for home. Insensible, Monsieur Beaucoup and the men apart. Here comes Carnauba. Can Carnauba close the lead. [announcer speaking indistinctly] [crowd applauding] [indistinct chattering] - Hi. - Oh, hi. - You plan on celebrating? - Yeah, sort of. What you got planned? - I don't know. What do you have planned? - Oh, nothing much. I was gonna meet an old friend, maybe have some dinner. Sort of unwind, you know? - Oh, that sounds like fun. - You're welcome to join us if you like. - Sure. Sounds fantastic. But I really do need to spend some time with my father. - Well, I'll tell you what. I made reservations at the Jockey Club. Why don't you join us there at say, eight o'clock. - Okay. Eight o'clock. - Fine. I'll see you then. - Did you hear that? I'm gonna put on the sexiest stress he's ever seen. It's gonna take him a week to get his eyes back in place. [bell tolling] [soft music] Mr. Nelson's table, please. - Yes, ma'am. Right this way. - Give her a workout for about 20 minutes and then walk her. - Okay. [soft music] Help me up. - Put that back up where it belongs. [soft music] - Go on, girl. [upbeat music] [ominous music] [owl hooting] [man speaking in foreign language] [horse whinnying] [speaking in foreign language] - [Frank] What's happening? - Somebody's taken Carnauba. Take care of him. - Yeah, I'll send Jess this afternoon. All right. Sure, I'll call you later today. - Hey. Morning, mate. Hey, got problems? - Carnauba's been stolen. Right out of Frank Nelson's stable. There were no witnesses. Just a note asking for two million lira. That's about $350,000. - Heavy. - Well, she's insured for more than that. Not that it matters. - Well, now what? - I don't know, Jess. If I pay them, there's not a resource anywhere that's gonna be safe. If I don't, I'm afraid they're gonna kill Carnauba. - Well, when do I leave? - You're booked on the 4:30 out of Dallas. Just buy me some time, Jess. Just some time. I really don't know what I'm gonna do. Keep it quiet, no police, no press. I've already told Frank Nelson. Carnauba's safety comes first. - Right, well, I guess I better get to it, price is right, later. - Jess? - Huh? - Have I said thank you to you often enough? - Yeah, what the hell. Too many times, baby. - You feel all right, Frank? - That damn jet lag. I thought we were gonna keep the police out of this. - Nothing we could do. One of our stable boys' brother is a policemen. - Oh! - Jess, this is Lieutenant Oppo. Mr. Cutler here represents Nathan Hill, the owner. - Huh? Signor. - Howdy. - They sent this. It says two million lira or they'll butcher her. It arrived this afternoon. - Got any idea where that was taken? - Nope. But Lieutenant Oppo here says he can have it enlarged. [speaking in foreign language] - Wait a minute. Just so I can keep track of things, could you keep it in English? - Ah, si. We have sent out a description of the horse both locally and through Interpol. Perhaps she will turn up. That is assuming they haven't already sold her using forged papers. - Possible. The registration number's tattooed to her upper lip. - Is this true? - Uh-huh. Any legitimate holder or breeder would have to check with the racing board before they could buy her? - Then they must come to us. - Well, if they want the kinda they're talking about. - No, no. You must pay no money. [speaking in foreign language] - That's up to Mr. Hill. - No, you must instruct Mr. Hill not to deal with these kidnappers. - Well, I'll pass that word along, but you might as well know right now that that horse comes first. - No, not for ransom. Don't worry. The horse, he's a perfect victim. High priced and dumb. I made no offense. I simply mean the horse, she no talk. You tell Mr. Hill they know key to the horse. - You're positive of that, huh? - Well, maybe yes, maybe no. I will to the enlargement myself. In the meantime, we will monitor all incoming telephone calls. [speaking in foreign language] [soft music] Hey. [speaking in foreign language] Ah, signor Cutler. [speaking in foreign language] - I thought we were gonna keep this in English. - English. English. All right. There is no reward. - Look, call it a finder's fee, any damn thing you want. The safety of the horse is the main thing. Now, it's as simple as that. - Jess, you spoke to Hill? - Yeah, just now. A few minutes ago. He wired the money this morning and we can pick it up this afternoon. - I'll take care of it. - Now, he'll be over in the next plane himself. - No. - Well, he can do any damn thing he wants. - Not Mr. Hill money. He is not to deal with his kidnappers. - Look, Mr. Hill feels the same way exactly about it. The $25,000 is only for the return of the horse. No questions asked. - Why should they take $25,000 when they're asking for 350,000? - We've been through all of that. We are the only deal in town. [phone ringing] [speaking in foreign language] - Frank Nelson. [man speaking in foreign language] They wanna talk to you. - Yeah, this is Jess Cutler. [speaking in foreign language] - Welcome to Milano. You have a very fine horse. We like her very much. - Oh yeah. Well, the horse belongs to Mr. Nathan Hill. I represent Mr. Hill. - Ah, Mr. Hill. The rich Americano who has polluted Italian racing with his money? He loves this horse? - Well, he ain't gonna marry her, so cut the crap. And how do we know you got Carnauba? - She has her number tattooed inside her mouth, no? 84796? - Yeah, well, Mr. Hill has authorized me to pay you a $25,000 finder's fee. And we just want Carnauba back. No questions asked. - Find her? We did not find her. We took her. You want her back? The ransom is two million lira. - You don't understand. We do not deal with kidnappers. Now, the price is $25,000 flat. We just want the horse back. - No, signor. It is you who do not understand. The price is two million lira. You tell the rich Americano, there are worse things than poverty, signor. Like death. - If you touch that horse, if any harm comes to her... [speaking in foreign language] Bastards! - Jess. Jess. - Daddy. - Get on that chair. - Oh my God! - Get some brandy. [speaking in foreign language] [soft music] - And it's not that I don't understand. He's been around the track as many times as most. He's carried a little more weight, I think. He's carried me lots of times. He's the best I've ever seen. He's the best. [plane engine roaring] So if you don't need Jess, too bad, I do. I appreciate it. - [Oppo] Ah, signorina, your father, he's better? - We still don't know. Romano's gonna take me back to the hospital and then go on and pick up Nathan. - Ah, at last. The elusive Mr. Hill. [speaking in foreign language] - He says it arrived by messenger. They opened it outside because they're afraid it might be a bomb. - A bomb? - The police think they might be dealing with terrorists. - Oh my God! [ominous music] [speaking in foreign language] [phone ringing] - Pronto. - [Man] So you see what $25,000 buys? But do not worry, this is not your horse. - What kind of a monster are you? - The Americano. - He can't come on the phone. - He won't? Do not play the games? I will ask once more. - He can't come to the phone. He's in the hospital. - [Man] The Americano and I were discussing a business deal. - Yes, yes. I know. - Oh, then signor, you will understand that two million lira is a fair price for such a fine horse, is he not? - I can't offer more than Mr. Hill is willing to pay. Hello? Hello? Are you there? - If you cannot pay, you must listen. I am certain your Mr. Hill will want to know how his horse died. [whip lashing] [horse whinnying] - No! Please, Lou. [speaking in foreign language] - A corpse buys you nothing. The Americano is crazy. 25,000 is all he will pay. If you kill the horse, you would've worked for nothing. [speaking in foreign language] - Do you have the money? - The 25,000? SI. In small bills. I'll bring it wherever you want tonight. - Perhaps you are correct. Place the money in a bag and go at precisely midnight to the Piazza Agrippa in Morivione, in the road to Genoa. You will find a phone booth. Wait for further instructions. And no police or the horse dies. Capisce? - At Piazza Agrippa, at midnight. - Thank God they're finally being reasonable. - There is nothing reasonable in a rabid dog. Come, we must make ready. - No, I've got to go alone. - But of course, this is why we must make ready. - Your father will be taken to surgery very shortly. You may see him only for a few minutes. [soft music] - Daddy. You're gonna be fine. You've just got to get well. Nathan's on his way. He should be here in a little while, and he's got you a good doctor. I love you. I hope you know that. I know with me over here and you over there, it hasn't always been easy to tell, but I do. It's always been just me and you since mama died. And I've loved you. [phone ringing] - Pronto. - You are prompt. Listen carefully and do only what you are told. You're being watched at all times. If you try to signal the police, the horse will be killed. Capisce? - Si. - Now, hang up the phone and look under the booth for a box of players. [speaking in foreign language] - Terrorists. Why always at night. They must never make love. [speaking in foreign language] [soft music] [ominous music] [sirens wailing] [speaking in foreign language] - You all right? You got the money? - I'm still alive. What took you so long? - Too much pasta, huh? - Yeah. [somber music] [ominous music] - No. What are you doing? [speaking in foreign language] - So, the signorina wishes to pay us a visit? It's nice. - Why are you doing this? [speaking in foreign language] - Big money? You're rich Americano, we're poor. Why else? - Carnauba? Where is she? - Oh yes, Carnauba. A champion thoroughbred, and they do not pay. I wonder what they pay for you, huh? - I wanna see her. [speaking in foreign language] [horse whinnying] - Carnauba, what have they done to you? - Lou, are you all right? - Yeah, I think so. - No deal? - No horse. I think they just wanted to take off with the money. - But where's Oppo? - He said he had to stop by his office and pick up a blow up of that picture they sent. Where's Anne? - She's at the hospital. Jess is still in recovery. Although the doctor said that the operation went okay. - Oh, that's super. That's just great. Well, I'll get cleaned up and take you over. - All right, thanks. [speaking in foreign language] [men laughing] - Do you realize what you're doing? I'm an American citizen. You're about to create an international incident. - Oh, really? And what will your government do? Cut off our foreign aid? - It's only a matter of time before they catch you. - And when they get here, we will be gone. Come on. You will tell them to bring the money before you and the horse get hurt. Capisce? - Okay, let's go. - Yeah. [phone ringing] - Pronto. - We warned you not to bring in the police. Now the price goes up. 10 million lira. - 10 million? Look, I can't control the police. They followed me. - An expensive mistake. - The Americano will never pay. I told you, no horse is worth that much. - There's more than the horse. - Lou? - Anne? - I was at the hospital and they grabbed me. - So you see, 10 million for the horse and the girl. A bargain, no? Tell the Americano, 10 million or they both die. You have until I call again. - Now, listen to me... Get Oppo. [speaking in foreign language] - We've gotta get to the hospital. I don't want Jess to find out about this. - Oh. Nathan. I'm sorry, I guess I must have just dozed off there. - You take it easy, Jess. Everything is just fine. - Anne? - She's just outside. I had her skedaddle for a little while to get a little rest. I told her I was gonna take over. We didn't expect you to wake up so soon, you know? You want me to get her? - No. No. Let her have some rest. She's been here all the time. - All the time. Easy, Jess. Take it easy. - Oh! She is such a good kid. - She's the very best. She is the best. - Who's holding my hand? - I am, Jess. - Oh! [chuckles] We better not let that get around. - Easy, Jess. Easy. You're almost there. [soft music] Ride 'em, cowboy. - No! No! [speaking in foreign language] - My apologies. Some appetites are more easily satisfied than others. I hope the Americano pays soon. Next time I might be too late. [Anne cries] - Oh, Nathan. This is Lieutenant Oppo from the Milan police. Nathan Hill. - My pleasure. I am sorry to hear about your friend. Of course, my department is at your disposal to help with any arrangements. Now for the call, we have made a voice print. It is Signora Cutler. - When did that arrive? Oh, well, while you were at the hospital. Now, of course, I understand that you have agreed to paying the ransom. - I want no screw-ups this time. That girl must be returned. - Unfortunately, that is the problem. I do not believe to the best of my intuition that even with the ransom, they will return Signora Cutler. - Well then we've gotta fix it so that they do. - I've been there. It's a long time ago, but something's different. - What? - The tracks. - What tracks? - Yeah, the train tracks. You see 'em? I didn't see 'em at first because of the weeds. - You are certain? - Remember dad, the picnics on Sunday with mama? The trains? - My God, he's absolutely right. They went right by the stable, Lake Como. Menaggio. - Menaggio. That is near the Swiss border. They intend to take the money and disappear across the border. Call the Menaggio police. Tell them I need the squad police and someone who knows the area. With luck, it will all be over by dawn. - Well, I'm coming with you. - No, no. This is police business. - But I've been there. - If they have not moved the horse, it will all be over before breakfast. - Easy, Lou. I know how you feel. [phone ringing] - Pronto. - The money. Either you have it or you start searching for bodies. - We have it. - You do? 10 million lira? - Si. The Americano agreed this afternoon. The money was delivered by courier. [speaking in foreign language] - Then listen carefully. We know the police listen. And we know that everyone goes to Menaggio. So I will make it plain enough even for them. You are to come alone. We will be watching the road. The first sign of police and both the girl and the horse are dead. Capisce? - Capisce. Now, where do I bring the money? - You will take the road to Venezia. just before you reach Lake Lugano, you will come to an old bridge. The stable is on the right. Bring the money there. We will wait till seven tomorrow morning. Come later and you'll find only blood. - I'll reach Oppo. - No, this time I'm going alone. - They're not going to accept 25,000 when they're expecting a million. - It's better than nothing. - I can get you the money. - We don't have time. We've gotta move now. - I go with you. - No, I've gotta go alone. - What if you need help? Besides, I know the area. I hide in the back. - [Nathan] Yes. For God's sake, take somebody. - Okay, Romano. Come on. [soft music] Stay here. If I'm not back in half an hour, go to the police. Hola! [speaking in foreign language] - So, you have come? Brought the money? Let me look. This is nothing. Where's the rest? - Where's Carnauba and the girl? - Very cautious. Very smart. [speaking in foreign language] Where is the rest? - Now, you don't expect me to walk in here with all of it. When you release the girl and the horse, I'll take you to the rest. - He's a liar. [speaking in foreign language] There isn't no more money. It's a bluff. - Bluffing? - Si. [speaking in foreign language] - Lou. Romano, you creep. If my father gets his hands on you. - He will do not. Your father, he's dead. [horse whinnying] - Anne! [speaking in foreign language] Why, Romano. - 'cause I am the greatest horse trainer in Italy. In all of Europe. But, who am I? Who will take a chance on me? I tell you the answer is a no. Not you, not your father, not the great Mr. Hill. So, I must do it myself, huh? But that takes money. More than this pocket [speaking in foreign language] you brought us here today. A great deal more money. - That's all there is. - The horse, si. But what about the girl, huh? How much more would they pay for the girl? Take the horse out and kill it. - But the horse is worth money. - More dead than alive. Kill the horse. How much more would they pay to keep the girl alive? You're gonna get more money. They bring us this [speaking in foreign language] today because they do not believe us. We must make them believe. [speaking in foreign language] Sure. It's only a matter of time before they find you. By the time they arrive, we'll be long gone, But we leave them work where to find great Carnauba. In pieces. Take the horse to Damio's. Now, where to pin the note. - Never trust a mad dog. He can get you killed. [speaking in foreign language] Besides, I don't like to share. - What are you gonna do with us? - If they will pay for her, surely, they will pay for you. Get the girl. Move. [soft music] [ominous music] [gun fires] [sirens wailing] [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [speaking in foreign language] [Anne screams] - [Anne] Help! - Okay, we'll just have to move real slow. - I can't. It's going over. - Very slow. - Oh, no. Hurry. [speaking in foreign language] - Lou! Carnauba! - Take my car. My new car. Would you prefer I drive? [soft music] [man speaking in foreign language] [gun firing] - Watch out! - Don't tell me, tell him. [man speaking in foreign language] [horse whinnying] [speaking in foreign language] [gunshots blaring] [speaking in foreign language] - Okay, [speaking in foreign language]. [soft music] - Come here, sweetheart. I'm here. That's my girl. [Oppo sobs] [soft music] - I can't tell you how sorry we all are. - Thank you. I'm gonna miss you. [horse whinnying] - Okay. Okay, it's coming. - We'll be back with some other winners. - I'm leaving. - I know. - But I'm coming back. Hey, are you listening to me? Or are you deaf as well as blind. I said, I'm coming back. - No, little princess. I'm not deaf and I'm not blind. I'm 12 years older than you. You've got a whole world out there. You don't even know yet. You've gotta live a little before you make that kind of decision. - I'm old enough to know how I feel. And I'm damn well coming back to see how the story ends. And if you think that mule out there is stubborn, you don't know nothing. [soft music] Bye. [dramatic music] [gentle music]
