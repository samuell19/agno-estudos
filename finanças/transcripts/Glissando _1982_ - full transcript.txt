History will recognize and condemn those guilty of this crime against human progress, and whole generations, still sensing the consequences of the terrible pain we feel today, will scorn them. Mr. Teodorescu! Mr. Teodorescu! Miss Agata is at the hospital. She slit her wrists. Are you home? What is the name of the most interesting lake in Central Africa? Who was the ruler of France before Hugh Capet? I don't know. Come, mother! Mother, come! - Mother! - Good evening! You see, Miss Agata, a prized student. He's coming! Here he is, mother! Good evening! Teodorescu Ion. Yes, of course, a very fine student. Math - good, history - good, geography - good, grammar - good. Yes. Good evening! In a pyramid taken as a cone,- the pyramid's apothem becomes the cones generatrix. Therefore, what is the lateral surface of a cone equal to? Good day! - Dr. Starcu, please! - Wait. Take a robe. Sit down. How are you, Stefanescu?! How could I be? How is Agata? - She's fine, she's fine. - Where is she? Sit down, wait! What did you do, cheat on her? Yeah... Come! Come on, move it! What? You're sweating. Hold on. She's sweating all the time. Hold on, dear. Look at me! If you want money, sure. - No, thanks! - 200? - No. We're friends. 500, here. 500 I'll take. - How much did Cariade take yesterday? - 5000. It wasn't worth the scandal. - I want to see her. - No. - Why not? Because it's not my hospital. - Besides, they took her. - Who? The director. I don't understand. Have you ever known someone to slice their wrists out of the blue? - Neurasthenia. - Have you seen her? - Yes. - Take me to her? - No. - Please! Anyway, I don't have time. Please take me to her! Talk with dr. Steriu. You look bad. Why don't you go somewhere for air? I don't get along so well with Miss Steriu. Take these flowers! Open the door! Thank you! I am authorized by Mrs. Agata for handling that acquisition. I would like to speak directly to her, if possible. - Right now, no. She had a second attempt, as you probably know. - No. You will have to deal with me. She's offering 3500. Don't you think I should see her? Nurse, take the flowers, please! I'm afraid Miss Agata no longer wishes so. Miss, not that way! Take the stairs, please! Silence! Silence! Madam director! Who opened that door? Close it, please! - What do you want? - The dampness, madam! - Dampness? A pipe probably broke, and there's water everywhere. - Where? - There's water here, there's water there... Water is up to our ankles. If there's a flood, don't say I didn't warn you. It's my responsibility. I'll take responsibility for this. - Send someone to clean it. - I'll take care of it. Get out! How did you get in? Who let you in? What door? Get out! Porter! Where is she? Miss Agata no longer wants to see you. She wants to permanently end any connection with you. She offers 3500, and- I advise you take it. Tomorrow it may become less. Those with uncompleted treatments, come to the bandaging room! - This hairstyle suits you. - Thank you! Think about it, Mr. Teodorescu. It's a fair price. The club, as you know, belongs to the clinic. But we have outside guests. So you can still consider yourself one of them. Thank you very much. - But, I ask you... - Yes? Tell her that my feelings remain the same. Mr. Teodorescu, I'm waiting for you! What does she want? A painting. Watch your game! How many? Two. Three. Teodorescu, you look like hell. Go to the countryside! Serve! Pardon! Pardon me, please! Mister, in short, as soon as you get home, pack your bags! Tomorrow morning, you're off! You're coming to my place. That's that! Peace, clean air, milk. Bucharest is an inferno. I have a terrace with wild vine. Wonderful! Actually, it's a bit dirty. We're redecorating. I have to bring furniture and all the rest. It'll do you better than all your sedatives. Look at yourself! I know, Alexandru. No ifs ands or buts. Your hair's wet, you can't go out like this. Have you listened to her? She sings on Victoriei, at the magazine. Import! Come here! Boy, he's much too serious. - Pour another! - You put that on yourself? What? No, my wife did. It seems that's the current fashion. Contrasting white on white. Look, same thing here. Right? No... Cheese, my boy. Steak, and wine like your father drinks. And we'll ride like we used to. I have a herder, I have sheep. I have a nanny for my children. You won't want to leave. My eldest is already fluent in french. Miss! Ich liebe... liebe... Late, very late! Loviro, get him his coffee! - How did you sleep? - Like a baby. Is professor Irascu still alive? No. I never dream anything. I sleep unturned. But I come home dead tired, to be honest. Beautiful home. We do what we can. The house was Vernescu's. We got a good price for it. We just have to finish the maintenance. In two or three weeks, you'll be a new man. I'll take you to the spa. There is some very good water here. Drink you coffee, it's getting cold! Nice, very nice! Where's the wife? Tending the cows. She'll be here. She didn't know you were getting up. Maria! You need fresh air. It's cold, but healthy. Hey! Go study! Do you hear me? Miss Nina! Meet a friend of mine. We grew up together here. Mr. Teodorescu. Nice to meet you, Mr. Teodorescu! Come and tell some nice things to this man! My eldest, Amalia. I have a younger one, Anica. Miss Nina! Ask her something in french, so my friend can hear! - I don't think that's necessary, Mr. Agiu. - Why? - She's shy? - So what? Would you like some Verlaine, Mr. Agiu? I don't know. Ask her something in french, so we can hear. Come on, Amelie: "Les sanglots longs" Come on: "Les sanglots longs / Des violons" So stubborn! "Les sanglots longs" I'm sure Miss Amalia will recite for me- when we know each other better. Anyway, it's time for our grammar lesson. Give her a grammar exercise! Mr. Teodorescu has been to Paris countless times. He knows it perfectly. I'm going to see about those house painters. Then you can tell me many things. You don't know Paris? No, not yet. I wouldn't have thought. You have a very good accent. Thank you! Where did you learn french? - Here. - She tutored Vacareanu's kid, too. I'm going. Do you want to come? Now, now! Good morning, Mr. Teodorescu! - Hello! - Excuse me! How did you sleep? Good morning, madam! Come, Amelie, there's a draft! DO you think we should keep this strip? Hey! What are you doing, playing solitaire? Cold, so cold! You stained yourself somewhere. It's alright. - We have a casino here. It's pretty high class. - Where? No, no! You're feeling lucky. You came here to get fat. Amelie, come here! Thank you! Mr. Teodorescu, would you like to play some tabinet? - Tabinet? - Or a game of 66, if you wish. No, madam, tabinet. I heard it's very interesting. May I enter? Wait, she'll tell you a poem in french. Tell us what you think. Miss Nina! That one... what's it called? What's that poem called? - The Baudelaire one. - Preface. Preface, yes. Go on! What's wrong, dear, are you shy? Amelie, it's too cold! It's good that she's shy! Go on, tell it! - I don't think it's very appropriate, Mr. Agiu. - Why? Vasile, feed the hens! Why, Miss... Baudelaire? - It's trivial. - Who, Baudelaire? I don't think it's very appropriate for a child's education, Mr. Agiu. - Who taught her, then. - She learned it herself. She liked it. Nina, come here a moment? Miss Agiu, let me get a look. You will have a wonderful dress, madam. I don't know about this scarf. It's a wonderful color. Perfect for the summer. I told you it's fit for summer. No, madam, the color is in now. I'm surprised Mr. Teodorescu hasn't noticed. Just what I wanted to say, it will be noticed. I don't know, at my age... Your age is ideal, you should know that. Thank you! She should tell the poem, what the hell? I've got 6. Mal, I'll do it again. - Why? Let him draw! - Bring me a glass of water. - No, sir, no! - I don't like it! I'll deal again. Was it made for a ball? The dress... What ball? Where can I go? Look at the state of this house! Nevertheless, there's a spa. There are balls. The color is quite modern sir. - Why did you steal the sticks? - Me? Not true. - I had more. - I'm sorry. What are you doing there? Come here and tell us that poem! You hear me? - Leave the child alone! - Why? She's just doing nothing. Come, quit whining! Mr. Agiu, you should leave her alone if she doesn't want to. I know what's best for her. Les sanglots longs Des... Not that! The other one, what's it called? Preface. - It's Verlaine, Mr. Agiu. - Preface! You don't like Baudelaire, Miss Nina? 4 pieces. No. He has a special interest for all kinds of disgusting things. But sublime, Miss. Are we playing or what? Why are you cheating? Are you giving me the matches or not? - How are cheaters punished, Mr. Teodorescu? - I don't like them either, madam. - Please, excuse me! - It's nothing. I was just saying that I don't like them. Some think that they're found everywhere. Cheaters... Two-bit scammers, yes, pinching a hundred or two. They're not cheaters. Real cheaters, great cheaters, are rare. Napoleon, Rasputin, Caesar... Baudelaire... That category. What are you talking about? I'm out. I thought that, as far as games of luck go... With luck, madam. You play with luck itself. It's a great difference. Plus 5, 5, plus 5. Actually, luck is only a moment of grace. A moment of grace, Mr. Teodorescu? Yes, Miss. There's a special sense for that. If the time comes, you have to seize it. Are you a poet? No, madam, a player. An ill seen category. A novice, only I see that... Are you a great cheater? No, Miss. I' not built to be one. Seeing as I can't mix with the deadbeats and hustlers,- I am approximately honest. Like everybody. Amelie! Come! Have you remembered? The poem! Mr. Agiu... What, can't you see how foolish she is? Tell us the nice poem! I'm talking to you! Tell us the poem! Dear, leave the child alone! - Why is she so stubborn? - She'll tell it. When she feels like it? Alexandru, it's pointless, really. Got to the corner! Do you hear me? Dear, are you playing or what? - No sticks. - What do you mean? - No sticks, look! - Take this glass and bring me some sticks, please! Do you think that, if I set my mind to it, I could become a great cheater? You, Miss, of course! You're not joking? Actually, I'm very, very weary of this place. Try it. Maybe you're good. She can't even tell the... that... poem. If I could be able to lie to myself... That is what makes a true cheater grand and unique. He achieves the rare performance... Plus 40. of a complete lie. Shut up! Octavian Augustus proclaimed himself as god during his lifetime. What more do you want? Tell the poem or I break you in half! Alexandru, don't touch the child! Alexandru, mind your business! Ion, what's wrong? Where are you going? Mr. Teodorescu! Hey, Ion! Mr. Teodorescu! This can't be everything! What justification would suffering have for you? Ion, why'd you get so upset? "Nous nous faisons payer grassement nos aveux," "Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux," Stop it, Amelie! Amelie, stop, it's trivial! Go inside! "Hypocritish reader, my fellow, my brother!" Mr. Teodorescu! The poet achieves an ample and profound view- concluding that pleasure is experienced briefly. Mrs. Agiu... Mr. Teodorescu! "Like a penniless rake who with kisses and bites" "Tortures the breast of an old prostitute," Stop it, Amelie! It's trivial! Mr. Teodorescu! As I said, I haven't seen Paris. I was born in Bucharest, the Little Paris. Mr. Teodorescu! There has to be something, somewhere, a refuge, no? "Hypocrite lecteur, mon semblable, mon fr?re!" "you, hypocrite Reader, my double, my brother!" Miss Nina. I tell you this in confidence. Someone saves me in my dream. A providential character. As far back as childhood, when I dreamt of exams. He saves me at the last moment. Who? I don't know him. An old man, with a sad and tired face. Mr. Teodorescu! There's a kid with him, with a sickly and parchment-like face. I dream of flying. Sometimes I dream of flying. "Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l'incendie" The poet uses the esthetic technique of enumeration,- summarizing all human vice. Putting himself on the same moral ground as his reader. A retrograde conception, denoting a narrow spirit. Did you ever dream you were falling? You didn't answer: could I come with you? "Les sanglots longs Des violons" "De l'automne" Miss Nina! Good day, madam! I don't dream, do you understand? The last time I dreamt was 5 years ago. I salute you, Horowitz! My pleasure. How is the distinguished madam? Let me introduce you to a friend. Mr. Teodorescu. I welcome you gladly! Come! That's the casino. Come! The spa brings them a lot of money. I'm gonna run to the barber. Go on, run off! Miss Nina! Take the children to the swing! Alexandru, let's go home! I have some business. Go to spring number 5, I'll pick you up. Alexandru... Amelie! Couldn't we go with the children? Don't you want to go to the spring? It's very good. Yes, of course. With pleasure. White is in. It's not white, it's cream. What does dreaming in white mean? I don't know. Did you dream in white? Yes, I dream of a man with white hair. What's strange is that he always saves me from something bad. If I ever dreamt I'd died, I'd despair. I used to dream this during exams. I dream of flying. Sometimes I dream of flying. It's a bizarre sensation. Like falling. Yes, exactly. Don't you think that... this color is not right for the season? Yes, completely. And, afterwards, a void. Do you understand? - Yes, like floating. - Yes. - Everything is true, real. - Very real, yes. Welcome! I salute you, Mr. Horowitz! It's there, under the pipe. Do you see? - Let's get a drink! - You see, it works up your appetite. Tomorrow I'll take you to Ordeanu, in Maduleni. Who the hell is that? A man who lost his fortune playing cards. I didn't mean it, please excuse me! He's selling some steed. - Agata? - Agata, yes. What kind of name is that? Not Romanian. I bet she was classy. You always had beautiful women. Bucharest, different possibilities. I married young. But, you know, marriage is a healthy thing. In my opinion. How do you like my wife? She's a wonderful woman. I mean, how do you like her... Could you get used to her? - Get used? - Well... - What do you mean "get used"? I don't understand. - In principle. I don't know, I think so. - She is a pleasant being. - Pleasant? After all, what is a scandal?! A small one. Provincial. I'm asking in principle. - You are full of them today. - Yea. Through a normal divorce, I lose too much. I've managed to make some investments. Divorce? Just saying. Between us. I'm pretty unhappy, Ion, regardless. You got married, you started making children. And that's that. - The children love her very much? - It's natural. She's their mother. I'm talking about Nina. Nina? It can't be true. Are you crazy? What does true mean? Do you know? I know that I've got a chance. If I don't grab it, it all goes to hell. I need to find someone willing to get involved with my wife. I'll give anything. I'll lose all through a normal divorce. - And you thought I could help? - No, no, no. Everybody's afraid of a scandal. Stop laughing like an idiot! Alexandru, how dare you? With the money I'd give you, you could play for two years in you rotten casino. On money, not credit. Laugh like an idiot! Let's drop it! Come on. Come, move it! Alexandru! Alexandru! Look at me! I'm not a man. What chance would I have with someone like Maria? You would. Come on, get in! I didn't notice, but I'll be more careful. Come on! He comes from a very old family. As far as I know, he's... the last member. He had an estate near Roman. And two palace-like homes near Iasi. Lost them at cards. Look! Ordeanu. He stopped playing a few years ago. He's selling everything. He has two steed from Pascanu's stable. Like your father had. I think I'll buy them. Ion, if you would do this for me... I'd... The master! The master, where is he? Where's the master? I'm asking where the master is! Where is master Ordeanu? They're all decrepit here. Such a house and people! Come! Hello! Hello! Master Iorgu! Let me introduce you to a childhood friend. Mr. Teodorescu. Alexandru! Horowitz comes tomorrow. He'll take over. We looked for you at home. The merchant caught me off guard. I'll finish packing in 2 days. It's a bit difficult alone. Please! Master Iorgu, I hope you haven't sold those steed. I'd take them for a fair price. Do you feel ill, Mr. ... Teodorescu. Yes, please! What do you say of this barbarity, Mr. Teodorescu? Do you want to come in? I live over there. You can't go without having some coffee or a glass of wine. I see that Mr. Agiu went on ahead. Or do you want me to show you this ruin? The palace belonged to Sturdza. I'm sorry to give it up. I'd become used to having it in front of my home. Have you seen the disaster? Incredible. Mr. Teodorescu... Thank you, I'm fine. A pretty rare edition. Amsterdam, if you know. From my grandfather's collection. Iordache Ordeanu. He was a pretty well-known patron among European booksellers. 254. Do you paint? Rarely and badly. Don't come in with boots on! Morning, eat well! I think I'm getting a couple of horses. What's wrong? Her head hurts since this morning. I don't know what's wrong, she gets headaches. We must take her to Bucharest. Rheumatism, maybe. It passes, madam. I got it when I was little. Give her some air! Just look at him! See what fresh air does? Have you weighed yourself? You went to Ordeanu? No, Horowitz arrived. He bought the whole estate for nothing. You want jam? No, thanks. Just plain milk. - Where is Ordeanu? - Who knows? Abroad or in Bucharest. I could have gotten more. Eat, eat! I'm off. - So where is Ordeanu? - Bucharest, I think. Or abroad. - Who bought his estate? - Horowitz. Go on, eat, eat! I'm going to the stable. - Do you want a slice? - No, thank you! Shush! There, there! Have you met Ordeanu, madam? Excuse me? This man, Ordeanu, have you met him? Yes, a few times. He was here, too. Why? What did you think of him, madam? A bit old-fashioned, no? Did you shake his hand? I mean, did you stand close to him? I don't understand. Yes, appropriately. Did you touch him? Did something happen? I had the strange sensation that... No, I can't believe such a thing. Tell me! I had the impression of meeting a ghost. Yes. He looks very bad, poor man. He lost everything. Take the child to the iron rich stream! Anica isn't well again. Yes, ma'am. Is Mr. Teodorescu coming? No, Mr. Teodorescu prefers to read. No, why? I'd be happy to take a walk. Thank you for the meal! - I'll catch some air. - But it's raining. It's alright. We'll take the umbrella. Goodbye! The girl will see. So what? She'll tell Alexandru. He's crazy. White is all the rage. Why do you want to leave? Who told you I want to leave? The smell! I wouldn't dare to offer this to a woman. Why? It's good for the eyes. - Is something wrong with your eyes? - No, just in case. Let me try. Maybe it will do good. Although my distance sight has always been good. Is it good for long-sightedness? Let's go! - People will see. - I don't care. Amelie, tell the story about the good girl who went away. Don't you know it? Or you don't want to tell? Come, tell it! Come on! - Good morning! How did you sleep? - Good morning! Very well, thank you, madam. Why did you upset me, Amelie? I've upset you? Go on! She left because her mother- loved the other girl. And? And she made her work a lot. And she was poor. And? And the empress had a girl, too. A mean and ugly one- whose name was... You don't know her name? No. What was her name? Runa. And- the good girl- was always sorrowed by her step-mother. And she did all the work- and- one day- she decided to leave. She made herself lots of beautiful dresses- and- she went away. The girl walked and walked- and came to a gate. Why are you risking, Nina? Do you want to get fired? I'm bad. I don't believe you. I am. I'm telling the truth. I?m a sinner. I'm a coward. What else? Without any will. A weakling. I waste nights and sleep days. She arrived at the palace- and became a cook. I gambled everything and won too seldom. If you leave, I leave. I can't offer you anything. Nina, be good! The king- held a ball- and she- cooked- a lot of food for the ball. And, in the evening... Are you ready? Right away! Hey! Do you see her? Who? Her. What about her? Do you recognize her? Come! Who is she? Razoanta's Lita. You and Cazimir were in love with her in fifth grade. - The pulpy one. - No! Indeed. You completely forgot her? God! And I used to ask her for kisses underneath the willows. - There were some willows there. - Go to her! Should I call her? - No. - Come on, then! What's wrong with you? Are you asleep? Ion, why can't the women we loved first, die? What's with all this water? Will you do it? - No. What? - Maria. - Alexandru, I promised for afterwards. - You promised, Ion, you promised. Listen, if you're withdrawing, tell me at least! She might not react well. She'll react the way I want her to, alright? What's all this water? - The children? - I've talked to the children. They agree. - You talked to them? - Of course, I have nothing to hide. This is my only chance. I have to risk! I have to! Alexandru! You ruined my clothes! I'll see to this! Please! Back to work! Choke him! Back to work! Back to work, you boor! Mr. Curcea, my glasses! Never mind the glasses! Get to work! Did you cut yourself? Rub some alcohol. What did you do?! Please! I didn't see, they fell! You want to lie down a bit? What's gotten into you? Did you drink? Do you want a pill? No, thank you! I've tried everything. Useless. You need different glasses. Glasses? Yes. Stronger ones, maybe. I don't think so. My distance sight is very good. You need new ones. I heard your mother was a very beautiful woman. I heard so, too. I was too little. I only remember her hands. I have a painting at home that looks like her. - Who? - Mother. Maria, I want to leave. I think it's time. DO you understand? I want to leave suddenly. Without saying goodbye. You tell them- what needs to be told. I don't want them insisting that I stay. Will you do this for me? I want to get to the station without... Without someone finding out. Maria... Cheater! Cheater! Rotten cheater! Come on, get up! It's 8 o'clock, get up! I have no more cardboard. You have to get me some. Maybe you'll run down to the market. I was thinking I'd cook enough for two days, at least. Where did you get this painting? - Which painting? - This one. I won it at a card game. From whom? From whom? I brought it from France, dear. When did you bring it from France? How much is it worth? How should I know? Why do you ask? You want me to sell it? To whom? Last time, doctor Steriu wanted to buy it. She paid 3500 for it. Why don't you sell it? Is this junk worth it? I like it, I'll hold on to it. When you'll want to sell it, she won't want to buy it. Why would she pay so much? How should I know. Ask her. She must like it. And why do you like it? Don't tell me the one who slit her veins left it here! It's a foreign painting. I brought it from France. Is that Agata? No, dear. It's a foreign painting. I brought it from France. It's signed on the back: Bruno. You can look if you want. - That's Agata, right? - It's not Agata. Who is it then? My mother. You don't say! Your mother... How old was your mother here? 21. And you say it looks like her? That's why I bought it. Are you mocking me? You can believe me or not. It's your choice. Why do you care about all of this? I didn't know you back then. You have it, therefore you're still seeing her, right? Be serious! I washed it. Swear you're not seeing her anymore! I'm not seeing her, dear. Nobody's seeing her. We are. We? Yes, we. She's committed somewhere. She just disappeared out of the blue? Nobody's seeing her anymore. Swear you're not seeing her anymore! Swear it! I swear! Good day! Teodorescu! Excuse me! How are you? Where did you disappear? I been at the countryside. How may I help you? - I think the director saw me. - Yes, she was here. Whom was she accompanying? Where is she keeping her? Are you deaf? Where? Next! Number? Keep it by your chest! Keep it firmly by your chest! I'm sorry, that's not possible. I don't have any more. Let me show you what I've got. Here! Why are you standing there? Have you been recorded? - Yes, doctor. - Dismissed. Next! Inhale! Inhale, madam! - I am. - Not true. You're not. Inhale deeply. I am inhaling, doctor sir! Not true. Please inhale! That way! When did you have gall bladder surgery? I don't know. Not true. She didn't have surgery. Just to show you what a liar man is. Why are you crying, madam? Please stop it. She's allergic to bright colors. - Is something upsetting you? - No. - Maybe my robe is upsetting you. - No. - Is it too white? - No, I like it. Thank you! Dismissed! Still, she is a cautious person. Madam, one moment! Look at that! She's wearing white garments. There has to be an adequate information system. Understand? When a patient comes here, you must know all. The embryos in his mother's womb. All! If you seek hygiene. If not, clear off! But hygiene demands order. - Do you want an examination? - Why? - Just so you know how you stand. - I'm well. You think? No one has full health. - You want to get it in my head that I'm sick? - God forbid! It's good to know how you really stand. - What do you mean "really"? - I mean really, my dear. This is a machine. Nurse, give him a number. No, no, no. You'll find something, and I'll convince myself that I'm sick. You play the violin, Teodorescu? No. Do you see something? You don't. Pity. Do you see something or not? Maybe, if you'd stand still... Maybe I'd see something. You never played the violin? No. What's wrong? You have a dehiscence of the posterior arch. Like I said, nobody's healthy. - Where is this arch? - It's nothing serious. Violinists usually get it. Because of the position, the spine glissades. Sit straight! Is it serious? No. Most get discopathies. Where did you go? Come closer! And sit straight! What the hell are you doing? What are you doing, mister? Where did you... ? Nurse, what number did you give him? Nurse! He stole the bottle. This is not admissible, Mr. Teodorescu. Not between us. Keep it! Thanks, I don't need it! Next! Agata was here. - We've talked about this. - I think I've seen her. I don't. Inhale! - Starcu! - Inhale! How can someone disappear? Lower your voice, please! You're in a hospital. I think I've told you that Miss Agata no longer wishes to see you. That is all. She's in recovery. I've seen her. You were mistaken. Have you considered the painting? I'm offering 4000. But it is my final offer. 4000. I'll think about it. The game requires money, Mr. Teodorescu. You haven't been doing so well, lately. How would you know this, madam? Think it over! Only someone with the heart of a dog could enslave a woman like her. - I don't understand. - Like hell! I saw her last nigh, at the Savoy, placing the bets. Lizica introduced us. Top notch! Please send my regards to the distinguished Miss. I will. Close that door! Madam! Gentlemen, please, remain calm! It will be handled. Please calm down! I sent for someone. We're choking! We can't breathe, doctor! The door! Madam director! Come here immediately, or I'll fire you! What's going on? Madam director, the water's rising! You're still up? Someone left the tap running. Water's coming from all sides. The damp will kill us! It will kill us all! Go to bed right now! Madam, I told you! 19. Plus 9000. Plus 20. Lend me fifty thousand. Never while I'm playing, Mr. Teodorecu. I'm superstitious. I'll loan you. For two days. Thank you, Mr. Cariade! Two days? Maybe even sooner. Call! - What have you got? - Four jacks. Stop smoking so much, we'll suffocate! Is this a club or what? Do you know a better one? Start the games, please! Bets are off! I lost yesterday, I'll win today. - Luck turns when you lose a lot. - That's right. Have some patience, we'll recover. I know I'm spending your money, but it's worth it. I know myself. Now what's wrong? I'm not in the mood, I'm warning you! Understand? Enough! - You don't need money, right? - I work. You work... - Doing what? - I bound fifteen books. I work. Is that why you lie there? When I lie there, I think. Therefore, I work. I write. And stop wearing those hats! Devil knows who wore them before. You want your hair to fall off? You want me shoveling dirt? My work requires thinking. - Thinking... - Yes, thinking. I think, therefore I work. - Do the same! - Listen, I provide for this home. The idiot that you think I am. I provide for this home! Ruining my eyes to dress up those filthy actors. Why should I dress in fashion? To look like that whore? You've got something in your hair. - What? - Who knows? Feathers. Take them out! You don't like my hair? Who said that? - You don't like it anymore! - Shut up! - Shut your mouth! - I hate this painting, I hate it! You're driving me crazy, shut up! One day, I'm gonna throw an iron at it! Don't! What's happening to us, Nina? Let's leave here! - Madam, where is Ionescu restaurant? - Don't stand around here! No, let's go back! Maybe it closed down. Let's go! Closed down? It was here. Come, come! Madam, you shouldn't walk around here. - What's going on here? - Can't you see? Mr. Horowitz! Mr. Horowitz, how awful! Nina! I'll always be... How are you? We will create... a world for two. Away... You know each other? Where from? What are you doing here? I brought the hats. Do sit down, please! The way we used to... and I love you. Where did you get this perfume? Miss has an excellent perfume. French. Costs a fortune. Lila... Do you know this perfume? You know it... When did you get out? You can't stand here! Ion! Nina, please, something awful's happening! There's no point. I'll explain it, I will. Come on, smell my hair! This perfume is excellent. It must be worth a lot of money. Don't look! I'll explain. She never turned her head. Don't look, it's humiliating for a man! - Please, don't look! - Nina, my love! Help me! I feel I'm going crazy, Nina! I have to win this month! If I win, I'll invest in a business and be done with the club. - God, what a plan! - You could open a fashion shop if you wanted. It's coming. I feel it in my fingers, Nina. God, this perfume! - How much does a fur like this cost? - Why did you wear this perfume, Nina? Someone's waiting. Miss Steriu! No, no. A distinguished gentleman. Grey hair, older. The child! - What child? - Do you see the child? Nina, let's leave! They'll close and we'll be stuck here. What is it with that kid? He's staring at you for 15 minutes. Mr. Teodorescu! I wasn't expecting you. What a surprise! What are you doing here? Do you have asthma? No. Just a check-up. Come, come! Get inside! There's something about my spine, but... It can't hurt. There are only two extra atmospheres. How is Alexandru? I wouldn't know. It's my fault. I should have written, but I'm lazy. - Was there a death in your family? - Yes. - Condolences. - Thank you! - Good day! - Good day! Come, come, hurry! I sold everything, Mr. Teodorescu. Sit down! I'm saving the seat for someone. Until then... No, thanks! I wasn't planning on staying. - It's been a pleasure! - You know, it can't hurt. Well talk a bit. The only down side is that you can catch flu. - Flu? - There are too many people. - Let's hope we won't be so unlucky. - Let's hope so. It's funny meeting you, Mr. Teodorescu. Funny, why? Are you waiting for someone from the hospital? Yes, a lady. She asked me to hold her place. What lady? Have you noticed this girl? Hold on. I'll tell Starcu to wait 5 minutes. Starcu! - What, are you leaving? - No. - Then get in, let's go! - Can't you wait? - Why? - I'm waiting for someone. - Who? - You're crazy! - Why are you lying to me? You're crazy! - Wanna bet she's coming? - Later, miss, it's closed! I would have known. Get in! - No, I heard it's dangerous. - Like hell! Two atmospheres?! You can catch flu. - Who told you that nonsense! -That's what I heard. This girl is worse off. She spends half a day in there. She bears it less and less. I'll have to fire her. You know... It's not good to be seen with that man. Who? Ordeanu? - Mhm. - Why? - He has a bad reputation. He's a hustler. He won a lot back in the day. Maybe he was lucky. You can only win that much by cheating. He beat me good two or three times. He's forgotten. - Did you catch him? - No, but I know. His kind made casinos what they are today. Would-be barons like him. Damn him and his kind! There are no more cheaters, Starcu. Only hustlers. Can you prove he's cheating? If I could, you think he'd walk out alive from here? He's on this cure for three months. I'm joking. So it can be dangerous. It's not the pressure that counts. But the air composition. Mr. Teodorescu! - Excuse me! - Yea. I think that person isn't coming. If you'd like her place... I've been keeping it in my pocket for three months. The money, what I have left from selling. After paying my debts. I can't stay away from the money. I have to keep it at my side. And I lurk around the clubs. These days- they can interest me. I was- thinking of something else when I saw you. I found a trunk full of books from grandfather's library. Mr. Iordache Ordeanu. I dragged them along. Although I don't really know what to do with them. It's too crammed for them at my place. Maybe you'd be interested in some. At least I thought you'd be. She's fainting! Open up! Mr. Teodorescu, I ask for a small service. Surely you know a trader. I heard one can get a good price. I'll give you my address. Come and see the books. Maybe we can get rid of them. I'll give you my card. It has my address. I'm at home in the afternoons. You could evaluate them beforehand. I'm not experienced. Mr. Teodorescu, my card! Mr. Iorgu? A tall, distinguished gentleman? Yes, Mr. Ordeanu. Marcelica! Lead the gentleman to Mr. Ordeanu's chamber! I'll show you the way. Come! This way! You'll have to wait. He went to the pharmacy. Come! Marcelica! Good day! Please excuse me! You couldn't have sat anywhere. I'll show you. Better yet, have a seat! Mr. Ordeanu! The door is broken. Isn't there a draft? It's not the door. The house is crooked. It tilts, the owner told me, about one inch a year. - Haven't you noticed? - No. Look at the floor. And you're not doing anything? What can I do? It can fall, no? Rest assured, I'll be gone by then. Nevertheless, you have to do something. I'm renting this place, Mr. Teodoreanu. No, I have something more interesting for you. Here! I know people, Mr. Teodorescu, who, for a rare book- could kill or steal. Mr. Ordeanu, forgive me for asking: Do you paint? Badly. You've asked me before. Then, where did you get these paintings? They've been in the family. Would you sell them? The paintings? If you know someone... Of course! I'll sell everything. Do you know who the author is? I must admit, I wasn't interested, but I know they're valuable. - We can consult an expert. - They're signed on the back, haven't you looked? I didn't. They're by a French painter. Bruno. From Strasbourg. I told you, I'm not experienced. - Are you honest with me, Mr. Ordeanu? - I swear! I don't understand. So you didn't make these paintings. Bruno did. You said that. And you don't know who the woman in the painting is. Which one? This one. This, this, these two. Oh, I do. A relative. Maria Vidrascu. My grandmother on my mother side. - Not true! - But, Mr. Teodorescu... This woman is my mother. At least, that's what I thought for a long time. - Have you been to Strasbourg? - No. My mother was never in Strasbourg. The work was done from imagination. He was obsessed, Mr. Ordeanu,- By the face of a woman he didn't know. Do you understand? I brought a painting with me. - I assure you that... - I don't believe you! I will accept a possible resemblance between my mother and your grandmother. They, obviously, can't be one and the same. - Yes, but... - You know why I don't believe you? Because, A few months after I got back, I met a woman- which looked uncannily like the one in the painting. She was just as scared as me. She could neither be my mother or your grandmother. She will be 26 this year. Unbelievable! You've met this woman? Yes, I have. Could you, by chance, put me in touch with her? With the lady? No. I can no longer do that. I could show you the painting, though. I would like to meet her. There's probably a staggering resemblance between her and my grandmother. But it is, indeed, my grandmother's portrait, as I said. Can you prove it? - Why should I? - Please forgive me. I will satisfy your curiosity, though. I have some photos of her somewhere. If you want, I could find them. No. If we're lucky, I could find them quickly. Let's come back to the books! Are you a related to her? Forgive me, but you seem overwrought. Mr. Ordeanu... I should have confessed something. What? Ever since childhood, I experience something. It seems ridiculous now. I should have never met you. You know, in spite of all my sins, I consider myself an honest man. What are those for? - My tooth. - Aha. - Let me show you those photographs. - It's not about those. I insist that you see them! What can a photograph mean? It can be a witness. - What is more true than a photograph? - This mirror. Or whatever else. I understand you want to give me some books. I will take these, at random. Tomorrow, I shall send for the rest. Wouldn't you rather come, too? - I told you, I'm not experienced. - What's this? - Are you selling it? - Of course, if you know someone. Nina! - 3500, madam. - Excuse me, please! 4000 is an old offer. Today, it's 3500. Very well, madam. Goodbye! What are you doing with it? Give it here! I though you wanted me to take it to the office. Bye! Good night! Please forgive me! What time is it? Where have you been? What do you mean? At the theater, I brought the hats. They close at this hour? It's half past 12. You had a little drink. They insisted, what could I do? Cariade said he'd take me home. What's with the questions? I work hard and I expect some peace at home, at least. Where did you get this? Geta lent it to me. She didn't have a white one? White? Why? You'd like a white one. This stupid fashion. And you wear borrowed things, like an idiot. Take it off, you'll catch a disease! I don't have my own. This money is left over from the painting? Or from these stupid feathers? - Mihai, I don't want to talk about it. - What, then? - Enough! Please! - Enough? You sell my things and then say enough? Understand, I've had enough. Either it or me. And you decided it would be you. Did you ask me? Come and eat! How much did you get? - Are you eating or not? - I ate. Fine. Are you upset? - You eat! I'll keep you company. - I ate. You ate at that place? I ate, I'm not hungry. Why are you making a scene? I ate at the club, what could I do? Stop it, for God's sake, stop it! Since when does Cariade bring you home? Since he's also lending me money? He took everyone. The carriage was full, didn't you see? Why is Cariade lending me money? Why? You're despicable! Despicable! Aren't you glad, Nina? What's this? I bought it. Too bad it's white. - The fashion will pass soon. - With what money? The money from the painting. Come to the mirror! Look! Aren't you glad, Nina? I can't make such gifts every day. Please! Don't be sad, Mr. Teodorescu! You're lucky in love. - Are you still interested in those paintings? - Which ones? - I know of 10 more. I don't like such jokes. It's not a joke. Tell me when you want to see them. They're identical. You have copies at your house? Copies or not, they're definitely not at my house. They're at another gentleman's. Good day! If this is a farce... But there's no signature on the back! I've looked at all of them. Check for yourself, if you want. It make no difference. My grandmother probably met a different painter. Not necessarily. I mean, that's not necessarily your grandmother. Bruno himself could have not signed these paintings. You understand? I have my grandmother's photo. Maybe... Please, help yourself! Thank you! - Are you buying, madam? - No, Mr. Teodorescu. My patient does not have such money. Unfortunately. And, anyway, one is not enough. Thank you! She would need all. Exactly. This would relieve her mental state tremendously. You mean the lady who looks like... Yes. She's ill. Allow me, at least, to offer her one. Maybe, who knows? I usually bring luck to others. Thank you, no. Anyway, she would destroy them. If that's good for her... Please, this sketch at least! Mr. Ordeanu, don't insist! If you wish to sell, I will buy everything. Is 4000 a piece alright? All? - All. - Of course, you're very generous, but... One moment! I was speaking for my patient. I would like to make a personal offer. I like this painter very much. Let's say, 4500? 4500? Each? I'm afraid I will have to say 5000. 5500. Mr. Ordeanu? - I'm placed in such a circumstance... - 6000. - 10,000. - 10,000? Each? Madam, you must like this painter a lot. Expensive. Very expensive. 12,000. 12,500. 14,000. Mr. Teodorescu, are you sure you have such money? Am I to understand you're out? No. It was just a question. 15,000. 15,000? If I was a real man, I'd retire. But I'm not. 16,000. 17,000. 17,000. Each. So much beauty! - 18,000. - Mr. Teodorescu, madam! 20,000. Madam- as we say- I'm out! 20,000. A pretty good price. How about it, Mr. Ordeanu? I'm speechless. I can't say they were a bargain. - I'll send someone to pick them up tomorrow. - No need, I'll bring them. I'll send a car. You didn't eat anything. You're right, how rude! Some other time. Goodbye, gentlemen! If you want any more paintings, let me know! Though you should specify how many: 100, 150... They're not originals? God knows, madam. If you want, we could call an expert. Anyway, I don't think multiplication is legal. Why wouldn't it be? Since when? I believe it's illegal. Oh well. Good day! Please send my kisses to Miss Agata. - Really? - Yes. Also, that the painting is in it's place. - Thank you. - Tell her that everything is as it was. She'll understand. Mr. Teodorescu, could you come outside? - I would like to tell you something. - Yes, of course. Excuse me! The discussion was almost man to man. They sold well, no? You're a great player, Mr. Teodorescu! I found my grandmother's photo. Would you like to see? No. - I think it would be necessary. - Why? To clear everything up. There are no mysteries, Mr. Teodorescu. There's always an explanation. - Please! - No, no! - You don't want to know? - Know what? No, Mr. Ordeanu, I believe neither in photos, nor in explanations. I prefer things the way the are. Are you afraid of something? Forgive my asking. Is that how I seem? I'm honestly sorry. You constantly avoid looking at the photo. What I'm showing you is real. As real as me. Of course. Only, things degenerate, Mr. Ordeanu. You don't want to risk? Why play, then? Because that is the only certainty. Why do you? I haven't for a long time. I'm sorry for you. You must suffer. I don't suffer, Mr. Ordeanu. I tell jokes, like all Romanians. - I happy to have met you. - I'm not. I would have paid anything not to. Not my luck. You slipped into my life. Have I hurt you somehow? Basically, no. Actually... Who knows what it could mean? You can't know what you mean or have meant to me, as I- can't know what I truly meant to you. Or the woman in the painting, to everybody. I know one thing for certain. Our meeting wasn't providential. It was a mistake of nature. My head hurts. I'll go to a game. My wife liked the fur very much. I'll send you the money shortly. - Please, among honorable people, these promises are unnecessary. - Thank you! Do you mind if I join you? I have old friends there. I'm lonely at home. I never touch cards. A game of bridge, at most. Tell me, are Misu Cariade,- Creteanu, Ionica Istrate still around? Cariade won some fabulous sums last summer in Monte Carlo and Venice. Do you know them? The master's here. Why don't you close the door? Doesn't the smoke bother you? Where are you going? What're you doing? - You expect me to walk through this water? - What water? My feet are swollen from all the water. Go to bed! Lights out! Crazy man, get out! You'll drown in all that water! Plus Cariade, my debt. Later, not now. Check. I am sorry. Extraordinary! Where'd he come from? He cleaned me! Well? Mr. Teodorescu, are you in? Give me 1000. Plus 2. Plus 4. 4? Plus 1. Plus 16. Check. Four kings. 2000. Raise one hundred. 4 plus 1. Plus... 6. Check. Two cards. 1000. Plus 2000. I'm out. How about you? Plus 3. See, full! Pass. And? Open. I'm in. 5. 5. Plus 10. 10... No. 10. Check. I'm going thin. I'm in. Plus. Another 10. 20. Check. Royal. Another 1000. Cariade! You're different today, sir. Fabulous! Plus 5000. Plus... 8. 8 plus... 5. 8 plus 5? 5 plus 12. - See! - I'm sorry, you lost. Four aces. Water, water! Silence! Helo, help! I'm drowning! Plus 5000. Color. Bravo! What now? Are you leaving? What can you do? I'm sorry, Mr. Ordeanu! Well... You want to go out somewhere? I'm very tired and my head hurts. I'll take you by carriage. Mr. Ordeanu! I'm very sorry. That's how it is. Sincere congratulations! You played excellent. Teodorescu, fabulous! A rarity. Thank you! You cheated! He cheated! Are you talking about me? You're a bit tired, madam. - Makes sense, it's 6 in the morning. - Kick him out, madam. Mr. Iorgovici, mind how you talk to me! I don't talk to cheaters! Do you believe this crazy woman? Mr. Ordeanu! You're asked to leave immediately. Leave him alone! Mr. Ordeanu, I hope you don't believe all this stupidity. - A true player, Mr. Teodorescu, does it for sport. - It's not my fault. The cards must have fallen when I placed the money. Accuse me of anything, not this. You know what I expect you to do. If there's any honor left in this world. Mr. Teodorescu! Mr. Teodorescu! Come, come! Such a fine, distinguished gentleman- holding a tiny pistol to his chest. - Madam, leave me alone! - Dirty thief! Marcelica! You want to hit her? I saw! You wanted to hit her! He's crazy, he wants to strangle her! Antichrist! Thief! Common thief! He had a pistol as small as a cigarette box. Watch your step, sir. We are disinfecting! Be careful! Please take a robe! - He's with me. - He's not allowed like that. Thank you! You were right. About what? The hair. I think it's better like this. What did you do to Ordeanu? - What did I do? - Mr. Teodorescu? Madam! Hey, mister! Why don't you leave your valuables? Valuables? We are not responsible. Please! Your valuables. Here! Put them! Don't make me climb the stairs again. Put them, put them! Thank you! Ordeanu what? Ordeanu Iorgu Teodor. Why are you hiding? I'm not hiding. You're hiding from her. You don't... You don't have a cut here. - Why is she lying? - Who's lying? Pick up the flowers. - Forget it, madam! - Get a vase for the flowers! Right away! Pick up the flowers! She's adorable. I hate her. - Why? - Why? The funeral will be held at 10 past 10. Did you know Ordeanu? A sort of relative. - What relative? - What's the difference? - Did she tell you about the paintings? - What paintings? She bought some paintings. Beautiful. Cheap, too. Right, madam? - Stop it! - What did I say? You look agitated, Mr. Teodorescu. Yes, I am a little agitated. You, however, look good. Thanks. Are you going to the funeral? It would be indicated. Madam, what right do you have over this woman? Can you tell me that? - Mr. Teodorescu! - Why did you commit her? - What was her affliction? - That's enough! Is this club legal? Of course. It is approved by the health department. Come, enough, let's go out! - Madam, I'm sick. - You're sick? - Yes, my eyes. - What's wrong? - My eyes. Do you want to commit me, madam? Here! Good day! Look how big you are! Beautiful boy! - Did you finish homework? - Not yet. Sit down and write. Mother will be away a little. - Sit down here. - Where's the nanny? Waiting in the car. Wait with the gentleman here! Do you mind, Mr. Teodorescu? Miss Agata will be just a little longer. - Can you wait? - Yes. Agata! Yes! 1, 2, 1, 2...! Round up! - How much longer will this take? - There are a lot of them here, madam. You almost hit me! Watch where you're going! What are you doing there? Attention! Hello, mister, you're not allowed! Understand that you can't! In other roles subtitled by m4lvolio for karagarga
