Ooh! Who's this? Uncle Bob, it's Michael's guardian. Hey uncle Bob. I know exactly how you feel. May I? - Michael? I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, I never should have asked you to come over. I love you so much. You can't blame yourself for love's passion, honey. Ooh. Ooh, it's the beast, it's the beast. Run beauty, run! Get out of here. I'm not leaving her alone with you. You little shit. Hey, leave him alone. Don't you think you've done enough already? Who are you talking about?

Yeah! - Yeah! Are you sure you don't need any help Billy? Shut the fuck up. Good afternoon, my dear. Can you tell me where I can Dr. rosenthal? May I ask who's requesting him? Don't you know the world famous Dr. wachenstein? No I don't. Dr. rosenthal is in section c. Section c, that's a good number, thank you so much. Stupid nails. Paging Dr. sarlouis. - Jerry, Jerry, how are you? - Oh, doctor. Thank god I found you. You know the patient that I spoke to you earlier about? Yes, yes I do. Sir, he's right around the corner. Right here? The victim of a vicious lion attack. Really? Oh my. - Yes, it was awful. Mhm. Now there's no cranium damage, but he's been comatose for over 15 hours. Are there any injuries to the upper spinal region? None that we know of sir. Okay, well I will check him out and see what I can do. God bless you doctor. By the way, how's that latest experiment of yours coming along? I'm glad you asked that, because I think I'm on the verge of a breakthrough. Do you mind? Oh, not at all. Thank you, in fact. Helga. Hello, hi. My name is Dr. wachenstein. I am a visiting neurosurgeon specializing in severe comatose conditions. Oh, and this is my nurse Helga. Helga, would you check the patient for his vital signs, please? Yes, doctor. Excuse me, didn't I see you in a movie? Which movie? You didn't see that one. And you, are you a patient or a relative? No, I'm his girlfriend. He doesn't have any family, just his guardian uncle Bob over there. Him? Helga, did you hear that? This is his only living relative. How sad. You know, I'm going to try everything I can to help bring your friend back and possibly you could help me with that. Okay, how? Well, in cases of severe comas, we not only treat the body, we also treat the psyche of the patient, you see, so you must tell me everything you know about him. For example, for example. Was he a well adjusted person? Oh yeah. Yeah. - Good, good. Any fits of anger or depression? No. Doctor, doctor, we have a big problem here. Here, let me see, let me see. Let me see. Has his heart stopped? Yes, his heart has stopped. Resuscitate Helga. No, Michael, no! Ooh, mommy. If he wakes up now, he's gonna have a heart attack for sure. Live! Live! Live! Live! Live! Live! Well that's it. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I did all I could. No! That's it? He's dead? It's an unfathomable twist of fate when god takes someone so young and innocent. But we must remember, that he is going to a far, far, far, far better place. Helga, take him to the morgue. I'm going, and don't try to revive me. Don't worry, I won't. All right now, I will meet you out in the car and you be very careful, okay? Okay. Come here, you sweet thing. This is just a bad a bad day for everybody. Oh shit. Dammit. Oh, you are an angel, Helga. Delivering this fine soul to our gentle, loving care. It looks like he's coming out of his coma. Well put him back, put him back. Oh, Tammy. Tammy is that you? Ow, man, that hurt! Oh don't worry, you'll feel all better soon. Oh man, that feels good. Oh that feels good. - Oh he's such a sweet boy. - Yes he is. Here, put him in, quick, quick, quick. Come on. - Oh, man. I just had the weirdest dream. I was in Kansas and there was this tornado. And you were there. I was, huh? Good. And you were there. Helga. That's good, that's good. Into the car. Hernia! Okay, go. Take the body. The patient is ready, doctor. So it begins. One simple life sacrifice for the good of all mankind, and us of course. Scalpel, please. You know, I feel like Christopher Columbus on the verge of discovering a whole new world. He thought he was in Asia. This is a much better place. Yee yowie! Oh, I love brains. Saw please, saw. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. What's happening? What's going on? Helga. You're going to traumatize his brain before we even get it. The human brain is a lot more resilient than you can think, huh, Bobby? It can repair itself. Reprogram itself. It's even capable of deceiving itself. Imagining that it's better than it is, just to please itself, huh? And you know what? No pain, no gain, you know? I mean if you're going to make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs, right? Okay. Okay. There you go. Now. Oh, hello there, hello there. Ah, you see? The brain. One million years in the making. The most powerful thing ever created, because it's a master of everything. Probe. Now, let me see. Oh yes, you see, everything controls and moves something else, like this, watch. Ah, see, that's good, that's good. Oh no, wait, wait, this one's my favorite right here. Watch this one, watch this. Watch, ah ya ya ya yaya yaya ya. I like to fool around like that, huh? Ah, we have to remember this one, huh. Okay, you hold this. You really think that thing's gonna be better than my computer? One million times better than your computer, Bobby. And more important, it won't need you to work it, hm? Oh, you beauty, you. What's going on? He's lost his mind. Let's get some lights on up here. That's good, that's very good. Okay. We must make sure that these nerve endings align perfectly. Okay. Okay, Bobby, you ready to go? Selection grid activated. Okay, now this should be the upper left fore limb. - It's working fine, doctor. - Good, good. Karl! - Yes, doctor? See if there's any movement in the right leg down there. Nothing seems to be working? No, no? Okay. How about now? Yes doctor, it's working. That's good, that's good. All right. Now, this should be the optic nerve. But, ah that's it. Now you can see again. You can live again. But this time, it is forever. Speak to me! Success! Now, let us implant the brain. Okay, let me see him. That's excellent. Excellent. I will perform the final lobotomy in the morning when the brain has regained consciousness. Bobby, you and Karl, you clean up this mess and you take the body back to the morgue. Helga, come on. Right. Asshole. What? What did you say? Nothing. You must have heard my stomach rumbling. We haven't eaten all day, remember? Then order a pizza. Mmm. Come on, Helga. Food, food. Hello? Is anybody here? Pizza man. Hello? Are you the double cheese pepperoni? What the hell was that? Maybe it's waking up. Yeah, it freaked you out, didn't it? I think it's possible. Yeah, sure. We created a monster. The world shall be ours. Hey, it's our pizza. How much is it? Um, your half's five bucks. I'm starving, man. Whoa, whoa. Your half's five bucks. All I gotis a 10. Get you next time. So what do you think? You think he's crazy? The professor. He's a goddamn looney tune. I don't know. Maybe he really is a genius. Oh Jesus Christ. Don't you have any respect at all? What difference does it make, little man? We gotta put it back together and get it to the morgue, remember, testosterone man? Yeah, right. Okay. You fix it, I'll go get the car. So. What do you think? Artistic, aye? All right. Movin' and movin'. There's no way you're gonna be better than my computer, man. I'm a t-Rex. T-Rex wanna cracker? Ah. You hear me in there? Hello, anybody home? I don't think so. It's the stupidest idea I've ever heard of. You making that thing roar? You're not supposed to be awake yet. You're not supposed to be moving. Stop. Bobby, you doing this? I'm warning you, I'm a black belt. I'll make doctor... Hurry. There's a dinosaur here. That's it, now you really made me mad. Hurry, he just squashed a man. He's coming for me. Don't forget, $20 and numbers five and seven to win. Hi, this is Tammy, leave me a message or I'll be mad at you. Just give me the keys. "Just give the keys." Harry, I'm not going driving with you. Holy shit. Oh, this is great. Who put this here? Don't go near it, I saw it move. Probably in your eyes it did, honey. I'm telling you, the goddamn thing moved. Oh it's cute. Ooh. I'd love a pair of shoes and matching purse made out of this. ''I'm beggin' ya, honey ''I'm beggin' you please ''you can book a train to Dallas ''and I'll take you to Santa Cruz ''you can bet on down at the seven ''if the two horse lose, you lose ''listen to me baby what about me? We'll catch you later baby. hi, Tammy. I'm so sorry about what happened. Such a terrible accident, just the worst. It wasn't an accident, Michelle. Well, I'm sorry anyway. What was that bitch doing here? She was just trying to say she's sorry. Well she's a little late for that. I'll see you later. I brought you a kamikaze with a vodka chaser. How you doing? I don't know how I'm ever gonna get over this. You'll be okay. Time heals all wounds. You'll live to love again. I promise. - see you later. - I'll be waiting. Hey Billy, you wanna dance? Hey I'll dance with you baby. Uh, in your dreams. Oh shady lady gets an attitude. I'm getting out of here. Sorry Tammy. I can't believe he'd come here after what he's done. It's okay, I'll see you later. Hey Tammy, hey! Hey look, all right? I just wanna talk to you. I don't wanna see you for the rest of my life, ever. Yeah well that's just gonna be fine, bitch. I can't believe you let her treat you like this. Come on Billy, let's dance. you go? now you shouldn't try that at home unless of course I'm there to help ya. - Is that an invitation? - Of course. Hit me again, Ken. There's just no justice in this world. Just no justice. This'll take care of that. Oh my god, it's an earthquake. Oh no don't say that, I'm scared. Maybe it's a dinosaur. Maybe it's your breath, honey. Don't worry girls, caveman Ken's here to take care of you. - Well thank you Ken. - He's mine.

Look at those teeth. Thank you. Run Byron, run! Feet don't fail me now. What's he doin'? Shit, he's coming this way man. Get under the car. - Can you see him? - Shh, shh, shut up man. Shut up. - Oh, shit. Oh, my god. Get an ambulance down here. This is sheriff black's deputy. We need an ambulance down here right away. Over here, sheriff. You're not gonna believe this. What is it? Oh my god, is that weasel? Yep. What's left of him. - God. Sheriff! You better come take a look at this. What do you got now? Well. It's awful hard to explain. Oh, sweet Jesus, it's a massacre. Is that his head? It aint no watermelon. I think that's his nose. It looks like he's been bleeding, too. I'll bet he don't even bait his own fish hook. Hey sheriff, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You know you really ought to come hunting with us sometime, sheriff. Old Neville here, he was down right squeamish til I taught him how to cut the guts out of a deer. Shh. Hey. Hold up, boys. We'll blow this sucker away. No, sir, don't sir. What the hell is going on here? What's going on here? Come here, miss, get up. Come on, get up, come here. Quiet down, calm down, calm down. Listen, listen to me. Can you tell me what went on here? It was, it was... They're in shock, sheriff. You're gonna have to slap it out of 'em. Would you go get the ambulance driver and take him with you? Come on, shakey. Come on! You need me to slap the girl for you, sheriff? No. Go find some clues, okay? Yes, sir. It was, it was a dinosaur. Awhat? A dinosaur. She's telling the truth, pop. It was a dinosaur. Byron, what the hell are you doing here? I was at the party when it happened. Oh Jesus Christ, Byron. If you drop anything, don't bend over. All right, let's get this straight. Now you want me to believe that a dinosaur did all of this? Yes. How's it going, Byron? Not so good, norville. Norville, take this young lady to the ambulance, please. This way, miss. Listen, pop, I know it sounds stupid and ridiculous, but it was a real dinosaur. Oh you mean somebody dressed up in a costume, something like that? No, that is not what I mean. It was as big as an elephant. He was 10 feet tall. I'm not lying, pop. Were people doing drugs at this party, Byron? I don't know. All I know, that it was a dinosaur, and it was as close to me as you are. All right, what was it doing? If I tell you, you're not gonna believe me. Come on, come on, try me Byron. Okay. It picked me up, dusted my jacket off, and it killed those two assholes over there. Shit, Byron. I'm telling you the truth. Norville. I want everybody here tested for drugs, including the victims. I'm Neville. Sheriff, we've got two more squished bodies and a one-legged girl over there. She's still kind of good looking though. You're such a pervert. Damn. Karl? Is that you? Feeling a little flat today, Karl? This is incredible. I mean, it's amazing, huh? Any usable parts? You should've lobotomized him last night. Eh, no, no, no. See, this is better, huh? Because it's not, it's more than a machine with a brain. I mean, it is a machine with feelings. With passion, with opinions. We are on the brink of something special, Helga. We are going to be immortalized, remembered forever, with what we achieved here, I mean it. I will even hook up the libido section when it's our turn. And what about the other bodies? Yeah, the bodies, we'll just dispose of them. I mean, we just make sure the boy goes back to the morgue. And what do we tell our investors? Tell them? I show them this, and this, huh? I mean, they will love it. They are capitalists. They will see nothing but dollars, lots of dollars. But come, we must find our dinosaur. What was the name of that girl? What girl? The girl at the hospital you idiot. - Gunther. - I'm sorry, sorry. Body, please, please, we must bring the body. All right, now, once we find the dinosaur, I know exactly what we must do. - Did you hear that? - What? It sounds like tam. Oh, well good, at least she's up and around. I don't know, she doesn't sound right. What do you mean? What did you hear? I don't know, something's weird. Remember, she doesn't like to be disturbed, honey. I know, I know, I know. Tammy? Tams? What happened? I don't, I don't know. It looks like she went out the window. What do you want? Do you want my bracelet? No? Michael gave it to me. You knew Michael? I don't understand. Head? Ear? Ear. Oh, I get it. Sounds like. Sounds like, uh, fingers? Um. No? Uh, uh rain, sounds like rain? Rain? Rain? Pain? Brain? Name? Brain. Sounds like brain, brain? What brain? Michael. Michael, brain. Michael. Brain. Michael's brain? You have Michael's brain? You have Michael's brain? Is that really you in there? Michael? Oh Michael, what have they done to you? I miss you so much. I thought I'd never see you again. I love you. Okay, what do you got right there? Looks to be about twelve feet, sheriff. It could be the same thing. Sheriff, do you know what did this? Well I couldn't say right now. Well, can you give me a hint? After all, she is my daughter. Look, sir, it would only confuse you. Sheriff, I need to know. It was a dinosaur. - A dinosaur? - I told you it was confusing. Tammy, Tammy! Tammy, oh I'm so glad to see you. Are you okay? Oh, I've been so worried about you. Such terrible things have been happening around here. I'm fine, I'm fine. See me alone in a minute, okay? Okay. Hi, dad. What the hell happened here, Tammy? Who did this? I don't know, I think it was just a meteor or something. I was just checking the fields to see if there was anything out there but there isn't. A meteor or something? A meteor or something? A dinosaur? I don't understand. What's going on? See? What did I tell you? If you want to catch a fish, you go where the bait is. She's already been with him. How do you know that? I can tell by the way she's walking. Now you're gonna have to get a truck to carry him, okay? Okay. Tammy, something happened here. This is not a figment of my imagination, and I'm gonna find out what it is. Don't blame me, dad, I didn't do anything. Just a minute, miss. Honey, it's okay. Excuse me a minute, folks. I wanna talk to you. You wait right here. Byron, come here a minute. - What do you want? - Let's go. What are you doing here? She's a friend of mine. It's tough enough dealing with these yokels without you being here, Byron. Well thank you for the vote of confidence, pop. I'll get out of your way. Damn. Sheriff, Dan wants to see you. - What happened? - He's just gettin' on my ass. He's still alive. Who? What are you talking about? Michael. Oh, you poor thing, you've gone crazy. Byron, I am not going crazy. This is just a little hard to explain. Michael's brain is inside of the dinosaur. Oh my god. I knew he recognized me. What are you talking about? At the party. The dinosaur. I knew he liked me. So you believe me? Yes I believe you. The thing is, do you believe me? Of course I do. So what are we gonna do? Well we have to get his body back. How are we gonna do that? I don't know, I'm sure that we can think of something. At the funeral, we can do it at the funeral. Tammy, I don't know. There is no way to understand why the good lord would take this young person from us, but we must all have faith in the greater design and glory of god's heavenly plan. I can tell by the people gathered here today that Michael was a special soul, loved and respected by everyone that knew him. Now, before we say our final farewell, Michael's beloved uncle and guardian, Bob brown, would like to say a few words. Bob? As everybody probably knows, Michael was orphaned when he was quite young and it became my responsibility, my privilege, to raise him. The truth of the matter is... Everybody knows I'm just a drunk. He always gave me hope. And now he's gone. And I shall miss him more than life itself. Mikey. If you can hear me, I love you, boy. I shall always love you. Ensure of certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, through our lord, Jesus Christ, we commend to all mighty god, our brother, Michael. And we commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The lord, lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Ready? - Pretty soon. Real quick, real quick. Look, look, huh? You know what? We are going to put all these people out of business. I mean, there's not going to be anymore sniveling, no more fake tears. We'll just give people robot bodies for their brains. I mean, they'll live forever. We'll have a whole selection. We'll have boys, girls, pets. - Pets? - Pets, yes, yes. People love their animals a lot more than they love each other, believe me. We'll sell more little doggy bodies than people, you'll see. They're all gone, what do you think? What about uncle Bob? He's not gonna remember anything. I think you should just go ahead and do it. Me? Well you don't expect me to do it, do you? Oh there's no way I'm going down there, girlfriend. No way, no way. Forget it. - Byron. I aint goin'. Oh, god, I can't believe I'm gonna do this. Oh my god honey, you're so brave. Oh, it's hell to be right all the time, huh? Okay, you ready? Ready. All right. - Watch out for the worms. - Would you relax? Oh my god, oh. Oh, I'm so sorry Michael, I've never seen you like this before. What the hell are we gonna do? This is awful. Maybe we should get some bug spray or something. Oh my god, rats. Oh god, I'm definitely gonna get cremated. Oh I'm so sorry, Michael. All right, you do what I tell you now. Stay back, stay back. Stay back or I'll cut the jugular. She'll be dead in 30 seconds. I want you to go with Helga, you get into the truck and I will take your girlfriend with me, huh? No! I'm gonna kill you, skinny bitch! Byron! No, no, no, no, we need him, we need to find another body. What? Trust me, okay. Michael, Michael, I'm so sorry honey, I'm so sorry. We're gonna find you another body, I promise, okay? I promise. I love you so much. We'll be right back. Don't move, okay? I'll see you later. Come on. No kissing, you mad scientists. Ooh shh. This place gives me the creeps. - Shh. - Shh? They can't hear anything. You go over there, I'll go over here. Ooh shit. Oh my god, cholesterol city. The worms and the maggots gonna have a field day with you. Ugh. Oh, honey. You poor thing. Did you find someone? A beautiful girl. Byron, I don't want a girl. Well neither do I. But it's so sad. Sorry, Princess. I could've used those myself. They're all old over here. Dead is as old as you gonna get, honey. I had a cousin who would have been perfect, but he's been dead for a year. Oh, mommy. Ooh, honey, he's gorgeous. I think I found him, oh. Let me see. No way. Oh, he's perfect. Uh uh, not to me he isn't. Tammy. This is not our decision. Michael should choose his own body. You're right, bring him over to the window. Huh? Byron, bring him over to the window. He's cold. Pick him up and bring him to the window. Michael. I love you. What do you think of this one? Yeah? He's short, but he's dead, you know what I mean, Mike? He's thinking. No? Yes? Too short. Well you can't have everything, honey. Hurry up. He's gonna like this man. Michael, what about this one? He's a brother, Michael. He might like it. Soul food, rhythm. Huh? I hope this aint a racist thing. No, he just wants somebody cute. Oh, these bodies are heavy. Honey, I'm holdin' 'em. Oh, god. What about this one, Michael? Lift him up higher so he can see him. I'm trying. He doesn't like this one either. Okay, what do we do, they have no more bodies. Uh uh, Byron, I do not want a girl. Hey, hey, let him take a look. Mike? - Mike? We could be like three sisters. I don't want a sister, I want a guy. No. - Maybe? He's thinking, he's thinking. He likes it. - Byron, no. Good, get her out. Okay. Byron, Byron, come here, come here. They're getting away, come on, let's go. Come on. It's norville and Neville. Come on, let's go. What's going on here? Take the tape off his mouth, stupid. Ah! That's my dinosaur. Son of a bitch, it really is a real dinosaur. It aint possible, let's go. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - We'll be right back. You wait here. Wait, wait, wait. Helga. Chew my rope. Oh, Gunther. Ooh. You see 'em? No, I don't see 'em anywhere. Pull over, Byron. I haven't done anything wrong, Neville! You stole a goddamn dinosaur! He's my friend and I'm keeping him! Hold on! Man! Son of a bitch. Better get the sheriff on the goddamn radio. I'll get him on the radio. You just don't lose 'em. This is unit 102 calling sheriff black. Come in, sheriff black. What do you got? We found the dinosaur, sheriff. It's in a truck being driven by your fa... Uh, by your son. Byron? Yes, sir. See, a couple of folks back at the hospital, they say he stole it. Stole what? The dinosaur. Oh, Jesus Christ. Where the hell are you? Uh, we're at highway 23, sheriff. Headed west in hot pursuit. All right, Neville, I want you to take it easy, all right? Byron, they're gaining on us. I got to pedal to the metal, girl. Oh, that's my dad. What are we gonna do? Hang on to your boobs, girl. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. Chicken shit's heading into the orchards. Can you see him back there? Yeah, he's okay. Is anything going on back there? They're gaining on us again. Oh shit. Oh, god. Hold on! - Oh my god. Look out for the trees! Oh, whoa, look out! Michael! Oh my god, Michael. He must've gotten knocked off by the trees or somethin'. Oh my god, Michael. Are you okay? Oh I'm so sorry, Michael. I'm not used to this physical stuff. Oh honey. Oh, he's bleeding. He can't bleed, he's mechanical. What are we gonna do? You guys get out of here and I'll try to stall 'em. Byron. Just go. Dammit. Stop it, stop it. Get out of the way, Byron. Leave him alone, dad. That's my friend's brain in that dinosaur. - Get in the goddamn car. - No. - Now! - I said no! Put some cuffs on him and take him in. What are you doing dad? You can't do this. Let me go, let me go. Get him out of the way. Dad, wait, you cant, leave 'em alone, dad. You bastards, let me go. I'll scratch your fucking eyes out. - Calm down, Byron. - Let me go! Damn. I knew I never should have left Detroit city. You see it, sheriff? Yeah, I see it. Damn that girl can ride. What do you want us to do, sheriff? Call a dog catcher. Is he kidding? Yeah, I'm kidding, norville. I'm gonna call the state police when I can figure out how the hell to explain all this. That's a good boy, Michael. That's good. There he goes, just like I told you. You sure they're in there, norville? Guarantee it, Neville. Get the sheriff on the horn. What do you think they're doing in there? Just get on the radio and call the sheriff. Sheriff black, come in, sheriff black. Hello? Tammy? You guys in there? Is that you, Byron? Yeah, are you decent? Just a minute. Michael. Honey, wake up, it's Byron. Okay, come in. - So how you guys doing? - Fine. How did you know we were here? You told me this is where he brought you the last time, remember? I brought you some food and something to drink. Thank you. Are you sure nobody followed you? Sure, I'm sure. I came across the country on my bike. How you doing, Michael? He's fine. You look great, man. You think they're still looking for us? The whole world's looking for you. You don't gallop off into the sunset on a dinosaur and don't create a stir. This is awful. So what do you want to do? We have to get that scientist back and find another body. God, not another morgue, not another morgue. Shh. What is that? Somebody's coming. Oh my god, Tammy. Oh my god, oh my god, Tammy. What have I done, what have I done? I'm so sorry. This is the sheriff speaking. Now, I know you're in there. I want you to come out with your hands up and nobody will get hurt, dear. You reckon that thing has hands, sheriff? You wanna shut up, norville? What are we gonna do? Wait, wait, wait a minute. I'ma go out there and arrange a truce or somethin'. You think it's safe? They've got guns and everything. That's my daddy, honey. You think he'll listen to you? I don't know! He hasn't so far. Well maybe I should go with you. I think Michael's trying to say that's a good idea. Yeah, let's do that. Okay, what are we gonna do? We need something white, something white, besides you. Looks like somebody's coming out, sheriff. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, we're humans. Hold your fire. Hold your fire, everybody, hold your fire. He's waving a flag. Hell that aint no flag, sheriff. That's a goddamn brassiere. We're not here to surrender. We're here to negotiate. Negotiate my ass. I've had enough of this crap, Byron. Take him in. No, you can't do that, dad! No! No! - You let her go, Neville! - Stop it, stop it, leave him alone! - Bastard! - Just leave him alone... - Hold your fire, hold your fire. He's my boyfriend! Leave him alone! It's that crazy doctor and that lanky bitch again. What the hell is going on here? What are you doing? Get the hell out of here. That is my dinosaur that you are threatening. I made him and he is mine! He's the one that caused all this. He put my boyfriend's brain in that thing! She doesn't even know what she's talking about. I mean, she's totally out of her mind. I mean, it's a mechanical dinosaur. She's telling the truth. Won't anybody believe us? If that's your dinosaur, can you control it? Yes, absolutely. - No. - He's lying, can't you tell? You just let me go in there, with my tranquilizer gun, and I will immobilize him immediately. He's gonna kill Michael. I don't even know who this Michael is. Hey, pop. If it's a machine, then how can a tranquilizer work on it? It's a new system. Brand new. And it's very secretive, but, under the circumstances, I suppose I have no alternative. You see, the dinosaur has a new memory system. A new computer created by growing living crystals into memory cells. It's very new, very new indeed. In fact it is so new, that I mean we are hoping that it'll put America back on top. All right. - No. - How long do you need? A minute, less than a minute. - All right, go ahead. - No! I stop! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, relax, relax. This is a tranquilizer gun. I know it looks big, but, they don't make small tranquilizer guns. And then you come, you have your picture taken with the beast, all right? Michael? Where are you? Do not be worried, my friend. We are here to help you. Good shot. Uh oh. What the hell was that? Open fire. No! He's goin' down. Hold your fire, hold your fire! Michael! Oh my god. Good shootin', norville. Thank you, Neville. Michael! Michael, can you hear me? Michael, I love you so much. No! God, how could I live without you? Hey mom. Hi! How are you, honey? - Good. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. What about me? What do I get? Oh, dad I'm so sorry. I'll see you guys in a little bit. - Yeah. - Okay. It's just not right, her being so happy like that after what she's been through. If you ask me, it's not right him being up there like that. Hi, honey. How you doin'? I missed you. Oh honey, I missed you too. You want the usual? Desperately. Okay. I've got some good news. They found the frozen bodies of those skiers that were lost. I'm gonna check it out tomorrow. I love skiing. - Cheers. - Cheers to you, honey. Mm. Oh, yeah. There you go. Oh, man. Hit me again. Ah ah ah, your analyst said you were having trouble adjusting, remember? I think one's good enough for now. So, want a little action? Oh yeah. I've been waitin' all day. I'll be right back. Ah, don't be long. I hate being on my own. Oh, man. Come on baby, come on. Ooh, you're so naughty, you drive me crazy. J playground j just wasted and nothing all right baby. Show it to me, baby. You're bad. J but it's you that keeps my love turnin' j keeps a fire woo! Oh baby, I'm love struck. I gonna have you. Yeah baby, take it off. Oh yeah, give it to me. Give it to me. J forgive us father j for we have sinned j we're taking all that we can yes. All right. This is it. I can feel it now. Take it off. - Are you ready? Come on baby. Oh yeah. Woo.
