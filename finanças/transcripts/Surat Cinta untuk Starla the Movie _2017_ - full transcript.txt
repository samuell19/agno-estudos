-I'm not a thief! -Thief! For real? I'm serious, I'm not a thief! Then what are you doing here? I'm hiding from the rascals. I'm so sorry. -Does it hurt? -What do you think? Hey, stop! Is it 8:00 already? Stop the car! Good morning. Good morning, sir. Could you come out of the car, please? But what did I do wrong, sir? Just come out for a sec. What did I do wrong, sir? Give me all your papers and your license as well. But what did I do wrong, sir? Just give it to me! Don't you remember me? Do you remember me now? It's you again. I counted almost three to four times this year that I was chasing after you. Because you are drawing on the walls. And my colleagues have been chasing you as well. You need to come with me to the police station right now. Let's go. Why are you laughing? It wasn't me, sir. He's my twin. -Your twin? -Yes, sir. He's indeed a naughty boy, he loves to draw on walls. And he looks exactly like me. Because you are twins! That's right, sir. I even brushed my teeth in the car this morning... ...because my mom told me to look after him. But no need to worry, sir. If I see him, I'm going to tell my parents about it. Now it's better for you to do your duty and please excuse me, sir. I almost forgot. I'm an officer. So you are saying... ...the water burst from before also came from your twin's mouth? Now come to the police station with me. Forgive me, sir. Please, forgive me. Please help me, sir. I'm in a rush looking for my twin. Please, sir. Okay then. Thank you, sir. So did he believe your story about your twin? Hema, you are so mischievous. I told him I don't meant to, and I told him I'm sorry. It's such a relief that he's a good guy and let me go. That's why you were late? Not really. I'm not a morning person. Without my alarm, I might sleep 'till noon. It's okay. Does your nose... ...still hurts? It's not a big deal. Why did you call me early in the morning? There's nothing special. Do I need a reason to meet you? How long you've been running this coffee shop? It's not my intention actually, but my mom is so in love with coffee. So here we are. And you? What do you like? Sorry. Yes, Mom. Are you busy? I'm not busy, Mom. What is it? I'm a little busy right now. Help me bring the coffee sample from roasting house. Can you do that? Then bring it to Opa Harjo's house. Just give it to Aunty Bulan. She's staying there, okay? -Okay, Mom, I will. -Okay. Do you still remember the way to Opa Harjo's house? Of course I do. You've took me there a couple times. Okay, thank you very much. -Bye. -Bye. Hey, Starla! Good morning! Hi! How rude... Morning, Romi. My name is Romeo! Romi, don't change it recklessly! Just don't do it And don't get too friendly with me. Sorry, I'm not in the mood Well, I... Hey, how are you? May I take your order please? Wait a sec... I came first! -May I take your order, please? -Me, me, me! I would like to have a cup of hot vanilla latte, please. It's sold out! It's sold out? So, what if it's sold out? It's none of your business. It's still early to be sold out. Am I right, Miss? May I take your order, please? I'll have two cup of hot vanilla latte, please. What a good choice! Please wait a moment. How come she can have it? It's sold out for you only. -What the... -Let me tell you this, stop the chit-chat and be a man for once. No need to complain. You are so lame. Hey, Starla! Hey, Kiki! Are you here by yourself? Yes, I am. Who is he? He's Hema. Have you heard about Bimo's going back from the Australia? Yes, I've heard. I asked him already, but he won't say anything. You know already how he is. Just let him be. He's indeed an ignorant guy. Yes, he is. Okay, I'll finish my meal then. Sure, enjoy your meal, Ki! Bye. There's the police station. Let's go! So, ...where are we going? Don't get flattered. What makes you think I want to go out with you? I'm guessing... ...you want me to take you out. You are so corny, Hema Candra! Mom called me to deliver the coffee order. And you want me to take you there? You are a freak! Isn't it obvious? Of course, I want you to take me there. -Let's go now. -Sure. But wait a minute. Let me take a selfie instead of a candid shot. Starla, come here! Hema, why aren't you asking me? Come join us! I'm fine to tag along. 1, 2, 3! There. Go ahead and spread it. Why did you bring the baseball stick? It has its own history. Did you see your nosy friend's face? He has eyes like a CCTV. You'd better tie him in front of the coffee shop... ...to watch out for burglars. Do you think he'd sent those photo to Bimo? It seems too late for you to ask this. Since we walked out from the coffee shop, he already sent it to him. That's that. That's an example of a wicked person. Is it hot? Sorry, this car don't have an AC. You'd better open the window. Let the wind in. It's okay. It's an old car anyway. Sorry, my car is messy. I'm so sorry. Sorry, it's a mess. What's wrong? What's wrong? If that night Bimo didn't broke up with you, would you be here with me now? If that night Bimo didn't broke up with me, I'd be the one breaking up with him. Stop! Here would be just fine. Wait here for a while, okay? It'll be quick. I will only take the order. Could you please go forward a bit? -Go forward? -Yes. Nini! Hey, Miss Starla! Where have you been? I've been busy lately. -I'm going in then. -Yes, please. Thief! Are you okay? Thank you. Look over there. It is an example of an environmental damage. The act of people who do not care about nature. But the one over there... Here, let me show you. It's an art. And makes an area like this more artistic. The police should chase people who throw trash recklessly. All of this has a meaning. Sometimes you can draw things you can't say out loud. And I'm sure... ...in life, simple things like this came unnoticed. Because, after all, you are one of those kids nowadays. What if I want to know more about you? There's nothing special about me. I am what you see here right now. I was wondering... ...how come you can move on so quickly from your fiancee? Ain't you afraid you made the wrong choice? You said I'm a freak. And you even punched me before. Since that day, my mind went blank. And I realized, it's not losing Bimo that made my mind blank. It was you. You're the one who made my mind went blank. Seems like my mind filled just thinking about you. It's funny actually. It's because of that one night, we're still together until now. Should I thank Bimo for this? You don't need to. If he didn't breaking up with you that night, you hugging me will be impossible to happen. Unless, you fell for me the first time you saw me. -Am I right? -Don't get too cocky, please. It's a coincidence, when I broke up with him, .and he makes me upset by sending me that bag, then there's you. So you are the right person at the right time. Just admit your feelings for me already. You remind me of someone. Who is it? My grandpa. That means... ...your grandpa has an appealing looks like me in his youth? Stop being so self-centered, please! Thank you. You said I look like your grandpa. Let me see a picture of him. Do you have one? I have one right here. This is the picture of them. This one is my mom, Gladys, and this one is Grandpa Hans. He looks handsome indeed. But I still look more handsome. What the... You look exactly like your mom. Of course, she's my mom, Hema! But she looks prettier. I'm just kidding. Wait here, okay. -Good evening, Aunty! -Oh, my goodness! How long has it been? -You are a big girl now! -It's been a lot of years. Mom said you lived here now? Arya studied here and Opa's already aged. It's better for us here than Bandung. It's true. Please come in. I can't, Aunty. There's my friend outside. But here you go. I just want to give Opa this from Mom. Thank you. Are you sure he's just a friend? He is my friend. Well, thank you very much. Sure, Aunty. Bye! Take care. Let's go! Is that your grandpa's house? Nope. It's my grandpa's bestfriend and his business relation's house. Want me to take you home now? I don't want to go home yet. Then where do you want to go? Take me anywhere. I'll come along. Is it possible... ...for the moon and the star to stay together? What do you mean? If I were that moon, I can't possibly shine without a star. Really? Is it possible... ...that there's a moon... ...but there won't be any stars? Or the other way around? When there's a star... ...and there won't be any moon? As for me, it's not the right question, Starla. Then what is it? From all the stars above, how the moon can find the most shining star is all that matters. How is it? Perhaps, the answer is the same... ...as how I found you, Starla. Hey, Starla. Wake up, Star. We've arrived. Hey, Starla. Starla, wake up, please. Where should I take her now? Go ahead, sir. -How much is it? -It would be 5000. Thank you. You dumped me because of her? What a jerk! You said I'm the only one for you. A liar! Miss, you forgot your drink. Consider it as a price for being handsome, sir. What an asshole! I got you now! What the hell? You are so mean! What did you do to me? -What a jerk! -What the hell! It hurts, Starla! Hey! Breakfast is ready. Ma'am, help me! So sorry, Miss. Last night, I'm the one who change your clothes. Hema told me to. So it's not... Hema, I'm sorry. Miss Retno brought this for you last night. Thank you. I'm sorry once again. It's my bad. Why didn't you wake me up last night? Is that your grandpa? Last night you slept on a couch? Don't move it! It was there since long time ago. Your grandpa is so cool. He's my inspiration to create and to love nature. But I have my own way. After this I want to take you somewhere before I take you home. Good morning, people! In this morning news, there's a guy... ...named Hema Candra and he's eating right now... I'm Starla, Aunty. Is she your girlfriend? Yes, Aunty. I'm his girlfriend. I'm so happy. It's the first time you introduced me to a lovely girl. Please have a sit. So here it goes, Starla. Hema is a naughty boy. All he cares about is to draw on the walls. He won't even go to college. I don't want to bother you, you already did too much for me. For example last night's monthly fee. It's nothing for me, Hema. You are still my responsibility after all. I even hesitate to let you live alone. But I agree to your wishes... ...as long as you go to college. Am I right, Starla? Please wait a sec. Starla! You almost gave me a heart attack! Where have you been? Sorry. I want to order, please. Wait a sec, bro. Starla, there are three new waiters waiting for you for an interview. -Are you finished? -Yes, I'm done. Just because you are the boss' heir, doesn't mean you can be like that! Here now, Hema, your typewriter machine is so noisy. Just change to laptop already, please! I'll go now. What are you doing here? I want to go anywhere you go. Where's my order? You didn't get your coffee yet? -Wait a sec... -My bill please. You didn't get your bill yet? Okay, wait please. How much longer? -You ordered some coffee? -It's mine. Let's go. Starla, how could you go just like that? So, this is your base camp. It looks cool! It turns out, your life is not as dull as I thought. Let's consider it as my second home. Do they always put a trademark on their masterpieces? Of course, even if it's small or big, it's still considered as their masterpiece. I never saw people do one thing with one reason only. They do it out of love. Why is it? Ain't it just the same as your coffee shop? It's not the same as I did, Hema. I did not based it on plans, target, and responsibility, but from love. Just like the other day, it was a match-making not based on love. But my mom said after I was born, she just started to fell for him. It's so complicated for rich people with match-making and stuff, and now it's happening again with you and Bimo. It's different with my family. My grandpa once told me, even if my dad came from an ordinary place, and my mom came from a wealthy family, they still saw each other since their high school, and finally got married because they fell in love. And I think it's happening again to me. Are you in love? But I have no clue how it goes later. Hey, I miss you! What a handsome boy! Starla, this is Athena. Hey. So is she the reason why you rarely come here? Is she your girlfriend? Starla, she's one of the mural kids here... ...and she's also a radio announcer. OMG! So you are that Athena? I'm a big fan of yours! -Thank you. -You know what? I tune in to your program and it makes me energized every morning! Now I won't be jealous of you two. I almost got jealous seeing my Golden Boy with a girl. By the way, don't get jealous to me. I call him Golden Boy ever since I met him... ...'cause it's what his name literally means. I didn't know about that. I only know his name is Hema Candra. It doesn't matter. Okay, it doesn't matter... ...but there is something that matters now. You are the first girl that Hema brought here ever. Don't be like that! It's the truth! I'm confused, how come someone like you could get such a beautiful girl like her? 102.2 FM Prambors Radio... ...Indonesia #1 Hits Music Station. -CJ still here and... -Athena is here! Hey, guys! Now I want to tell you we're not alone here in studio. We have guests here. Who is it? We have guests here! Let me introduce you to my Golden Boy, Hema. And a girl who able to win Hema's heart within six hours. Six hours? Are you for real? And who might that girl be? Here comes Starla! Hey! Hey! -How are you? -I'm great, how are you? Okay, let's continue. I think you guys are the one... ...who hold the record who fell in love within six hours. Please share some tips to our listeners. I'm at a loss for words about it. It happened real quick and I think it's just a coincidence. But I'm sure everything happens for a reason. How sweet of you! Ain't it amazing? They fell in love within six hours? It sure fast! It's like an express. Please carry on. Tell us more about your relationship. People say love needs a process. Even my own mom said that. As time goes by, love will eventually come. We don't need to fall in love first. Time will arrange when will love come. But since I met Hema, now I'm unsure about it. Those six hours with him speaks more than a year with my ex. This voice... It's Starla's voice! I am so sorry! Let me clean it up. Please excuse me. You need to know something... Just then, Starla's voice is on the radio. She's narrating her love story. Take it easy. Everything's under control. Now they are holding hands and stares passionately at each other. I think I might hit both of you now. Now here's a song for you, but first, let ask Starla this question. Has Hema confessed already? Not yet. He just send me letters. As usual! You are so cheap! Well, I have a typewriter with me, that's why I always write letters. The same with the postman then? They send letters. And here's a song for you guys, enjoy the music! Here, hold this for me. Hey, beautiful. Are you from Jakarta? Are you Reska's friend? Can't you speak or what? Excuse me. Let's know each other first. Don't go. I'm Teddy. The most popular guy in Bandung! Stop playing so hard to get. When I introduce myself to other girls, they'll be update it on their Path, Twitter. I am not the other girls. Don't be so naive. Just tell me your price already. Watch your mouth! Don't be a douche! I'm not a slut! What did you say before? I'm just asking for her price. What? I want to go out with her! I asked for her price! Come here! It's okay, Virgoun. It's between me and him! I don't want them to get the wrong impression here. Stand up! You'd better choose! Apologize to her... And I am his girlfriend. ...or we settle this right now! I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to you too. You! Stop making a scene! Get out of here! Hey, stop right there! You are still young, don't make a scene! How long has it been since I caught you for vandalism? Drawing on the walls, you soiled it! How long has it been? And I believe, there's still more other places, right? And since when... ...did you have an assistant to draw on the walls? Let her stay out of this. It's purely my mistake. No, it's not. If you punish him, you should punish me too! Look! Here's the proof! It's true I'm the one who asked Hema to make murals with me. No, sir. She's lying. It's been decades since I became a police officer, and this is the first time I saw people fight to be punished! Even the guilty one is dying to deny it! Your name? What's your name? I'm Hema Candra, sir. It means Golden Moon. That doesn't concern me at all. Have you ever thought about that being young, you can bring harm to your surroundings? And don't you feel bad for your twin? Because of you, I almost caught your twin! I got splashed right on the face! He's just like a shaman. Silence! Or I'll demoted you! -All right, sir! -Don't "all right" me. Here it is now. Bring both your own parents... ...now! I... ...don't have parents, sir. Are you kidding me? Yes, sir. Don't trick me, young boy. Your twins said it clearly... ...that you both still have a mother. You have parents. And now you're telling me you don't have one? I do... ...have a mother, sir. But I've... ...never met her since I was little. I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay then. Take it easy. I will help you. But... ...you both stay here. Don't go out. Until both of your parents come to see me. The officer in charge. We'll end this drama now. What is this, Starla? You embarrass me! Here you go. I'm sorry, Mom. Don't sorry me. What if your Dad knew? Dad will never know if you didn't tell him. Are you insane? Hema really got into you. What is it again? Six hours falling in love? It's impossible. Don't you think I haven't got a clue about it. I heard you on the radio. You said you fell in love within six hours. There's no such thing. It's impossible! What was it? And how about Bimo? Where is he? Where is he? You better see this. What is it? I don't want to get close to him. How come he is so rude? Drop him into the sea. Let sink him to the ocean instead. Knock on wood. For you, my life and death. I don't have a clue... ...how to write this or how to put words into it. 'Cause for so many times, you make me believe what love means. And it's true. Love still conquer above it all. When this fragile heart is tested by the world, is tested by materials. For so many times... ...again, ...again, and again. Is this true? Within six hours? We can truly fall in love? How come I never felt this way before with Bimo? Starla, you startled me! Why did you stop so suddenly? Starla, where are you going? It's in the middle of the road! Starla! So sorry, hold on for a minute. Starla! -I'm sorry. That's my kid. -Go forward! Hey, Romeo. Hey, Hema! Good morning, Starla. Hey, what's wrong? Go away! Hey, Starla. Get out of here before I do things we will both regret! Hey, Starla! What's wrong with you? Don't touch me! I hope you realized what you did! You broke the most precious thing to me! You can buy thousands of those ridiculous things! But I can't have a new heart! Why didn't you tell me you have a girlfriend? Or if you are seeing other girls? How could you? You pretend like I'm the only girl for you. What are you talking about? Bimo is a douche. But Bimo's not a liar like you! You were right. If back then Bimo didn't break up with me, we won't be together like now. You are just my get away. It's impossible... ...for a man like you whom I knew within six hours... ...can eradicate those precious memories I have with Bimo for a year! Starla! What's wrong? Why are you so sad? If it's going to be a hurtful end, why did love should exist in the first place? Yeah? There's someone looking for Miss Starla outside. What are you doing here? Is hurting me not enough for you? I know... ...there won't be any right words to make you forgive me. That's why I bring you this flower. And with this flower, I want you to know... ...my feelings for you never changed. What is it then? Have you forgotten? If... ...those mean words you said... ...to me a week ago could be replaced with flowers. Trust me, Bim, even one flower shop won't be enough... ...to replace how broken I was that day! And one thing you should know. Even if you didn't sent me those means texts, I'd still broken up with you! 'Cause since day one, I never felt anything for you. Star, please. Star, will you let me in? So are you the reason Starla left me? Where do you think you are going? Take it easy, bro. Chill, bro. You should ask yourself why she left you. Don't you ever ask me again about Starla! And you! You shouldn't have wasted your data plan to stalk Starla. She didn't have any feelings left for your friend! Hey, Starla! I'm not in the mood right now, Rom. I'm not in the mood to joke either. Here you go. It's for you. Starla. Until now, I never know... ...what did I do wrong to make you hate me. There's only one thing I know. You shouldn't be playing with my feelings. And maybe I'm too naive. I saw everything from my own point of view. And everything is white. Maybe that's my big mistake. I can't give enough color to your heart. If everything has no meaning anymore, and if it's the end of that six hours, it's only that letter that I can give to you, Starla. Maybe your heart can save it as memories. Even if I'm no longer in your life. What the... Sir! Stop, sir! Please stop, sir! Sir! Hey, people! For your newest info, have you heard the latest update about my best friend? The Golden Boy with his viral masterpiece. Nowadays, where can we find someone as romantic as him? Confessed his feelings through mural on walls. And the phenomenal about it is he even got chased by the police doing it. Starla, oh, my goodness! It's my first time seeing the viral mural that makes my heart's melt... Look, Starla! Ain't it cool? His quotes are so cool! -Let me see! -Here, let me read it for you. "The EARTH without ART, it's just EH." I'll show you the cool one. "Dance like nobody's watching, love like you'd never been hurt." Oh, my God! But the most sweet of all is they said he made it for his crush. I am so envious of her. I want someone to makes a quote about me. How lucky she is! "A moon can't shine without a star." How sweet it is! I want to be his "star". Here's another one. "The only star in my own sky." If I've ever meet this kinda guy, I'd never let him go. That's right! Starla, wait! Starla, where are you going? I don't know, Mom. Anywhere, as long as I can forget Hema. Starla, put your hands here. Feel it. You can be dishonest with me, with Romi, with Hema, or anyone. But you never can be dishonest with yourself. You have your own heart. You need to be true to your heart. If those six hours is enough... ...to make you guys fall in love, then it shall make you unite forever. You need to believe. Now, after it's all over, can I make letters once again for the world? Just like before I met Starla. What is it, Hema? I should be the one who's asking you that. Who is it, Aunty? Why would you lie about that? You said the last time you met them was at their wedding! Hema... ...I can explain everything. Explain everything then. That's the picture of your mother. Who is the child, Aunty? It is you... It's... It's... It is the picture of your dad, your mom, and the both of you. This was the last time your mom... ...took a picture with you and your twin. Hema... Your dad asked me to promise him... ...to never let you meet your mom. But why? There must be a reason. Remember this. Never say anything to Bulan... ...about the existence of Hema. Never. My grandson don't need to meet his mom. -But Dad... -Bulan has already chosen. She chose his dictator father... ...over her own son. Let me ask you this, if you never knew me, and you saw me and Hema together, you'll assume we're more than friends, right? You shouldn't be so childish. Even if he walked with another girl, it doesn't mean they're together as a couple. It just doesn't makes sense. Hey, people. We're back here again with Athena. I felt sorry for my bestfriend. I hope your love story is not as sad as theirs. Now there's a message to Hema from Starla. Yesterday, Hema touched us with his letter. Now, can Starla and Hema... ...made it through this? As for me, they will make it! I'm so sure of that! Hema... I don't know where to find you. If you hear this, please meet me at the place where we first met. I want to meet you. Are you ready to explain everything? Hema! Are you satisfied now? Acting after all of this time? What do you mean? This is... ...my mom... ...holding me. And this one... ...is your mom... ...holding my twin brother. And this guy, isn't this your grandpa? You said I look like your grandpa. Let me see the picture of him. Do you have one? This one is my mom and this one is Grandpa. My mom, Gladys, and Grandpa Hans. He's the one who made me lose my family! We are family. I have talked to Hans... ...to not make this problem huge. The simple way is... ...our in-laws here is agreed to withdraw all of the news, and there won't be any news that should resurface. Is that right? You don't need to worry. Mas Harjo and I... ...are experienced entrepreneur... ...and we know how hard for you to hear these news. I am ready to compensate for everything... ...as long as it doesn't appear in print. So, what you're saying is I'm bribing you? Let's not consider it as a bribe or stuff. Not at all. I prefer not to use another option. Am I right? So is this the reason... ...why I was invited here? If that is so, there's nothing to talk about. Now you should make a choice! Tell your dad to withdraw the news... ...that can ruin me and Hans' reputation... ...or you can leave Bulan and Arya! Call your father now! I'm sorry, Bulan. I hope one day... ...Hema... ...and Arya can forgive you... ...for what you did today. You are so cocky! So the one I saw before... Oh God! It's my mistake. Hema... ...what I told you about those six hours, it's all true. And I am clueless about all of this. Maybe... ...in here, the place that love starts. Everything starts from that six hours... ...and it ends here. Grandpa, Dad, I'll go for a while. I need time to make peace with my past. Hema! Where are you going? Anywhere, Aunty. -A place where there are no lies. -Hema. Maybe it is true... ...that there are things we don't need to know. And I don't know which one hurts the most. Knowing my mom is dead... ...or knowing my mom is still alive, but won't make any effort to find me. And what hurts the most is, the only girl I love... ...is involved in the ruin of my family. Hema... Hema! Starla did nothing! I'm the one at fault! I did not look for you! I'm the one at fault. I'm the one who separated you all from each other. I am the one who make you separated with your mom and your twin. Hema. Now, please tell me what I should do... ...to make up all of my sin. Can you make up for the lost 19 years of my life? Hema... I told you nothing about this... ...because I made a promise to your dad and to your grandpa. And now that you finally found the picture, it's a sign from God that it's time you to know the truth. Hema... It's your twin. Romeo! Have you seen Starla? Here. What is it? Do you think I'm a postman? Sending letters for people. Hema, you both are so weird. It's a 21st Century, what's with the letters? You live in a city. You can use WhatsApp, for God sakes! Dear Hema, people said we need to have courage to let go. But for me, I want to have courage to hold on. I'm not giving up! Because for me, those six hours is not a lie or even fake. And there's one thing you should know. There's a reason why I got so mad at you. I fell for you, Hema Candra. You have to know... ...I broke up with Bimo that day... ...because I have feelings that... ...someone who stood in front of me that day... ...is way more deserving to own me forever. I want time to give me back the only shining star I know. It's you, Hema Candra. Over all of the questions that I have, there's only one answer for me. After our six hours together, you and I... ...are the same as the moon and the stars that shines together on the same sky. From all the stars above, how the moon finds the most shining star is all that matters. Perhaps, the answer is the same as to how I found you, Starla. I know you'll be here. I know... ...we'll never be able to reach the sky. But whenever I am here, I feel like I can get close to the sky. The sky where the moon and the stars shines together forever.
