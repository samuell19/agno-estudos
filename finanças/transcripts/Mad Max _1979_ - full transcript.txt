Can you make it? - We'll make it! Move over! - No room! I'm driving! Not this again! I've been assigned! Hang on. I'm supposed to drive this crate! Darn you. Go on. Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this thing? A twisto bikey, scoot jockey. A few hours ago, down in Sun City, he goes berserk. Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie and takes off in a Pursuit Special. We've been on him ever since. This one's right up the air, Roop. I've seen the style before. Terminal psychotic. What's he driving? That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s. Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey! Okay, we're about half a mile off Anarchie Road. You'll see him any minute now. Rip the guts out of it. Give it the bejesus! See him yet? Got it! I'm gonna blow him away!

We got you, we're going. Born with a steering wheel in his hand and lead in his foot. He is the Nightrider cruising at the speed of fright! This is the Nightrider, and we ain't never coming back! I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine! I am a rocker! I am a roller! I think we're still mobile. For Christ's sake, shove over! You're blaspheming again. I don't have to work with a blasphemer. I am the Nightrider! Big Bopper to March Hare. We're still in the game, okay? Understand this. That scag and his floozy, they're gonna die! Main Force to Gosling One. Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond. MFP to Gosling One. Main Force to Gosling One. It was all slow motion. He leaves his seat and goes through the windscreen, headfirst straight into the tree, right? And then bounces back through the windscreen. By the time we got to him, he was just sitting there trying to scream with his face ripped off. What's the matter? Not hungry, am I? Give it here. - I'll tell you what... - Look at that. - Christ! - Strewth, at it again. Catch you later, Goose. Christ, they're heading for population! What's this I hear about you and Jonathan? - What about Jonathan? - You were seen with him two nights ago. So what? It's this way. He's gone. Bastards! Shit! We're really gonna get it this time. - He had his indicator on. - Shut up! No, you're not going on. Stay off the road! Of course, I'm going on. Shut up! People's lives are in peril! Stay off the roads! I'm gonna have him! Stay off the roads! Get off the road! - I got him! Shut up! - Stay off the roads! Oh, my God. Watch out! I am ready. I am ready for your best. Oh, my God, what happened? I don't know, man. I just got here myself. I think he broke his leg. I want to find out what's happening. Max, can you hear me? Main Force Patrol, we're out of the game, unable to continue pursuit. You'd better send a meat truck. Charlie's copped a saucer in the throat. Hey, Max? Max? Go ahead. We are 100 percent SNAFUed. You okay? Nothing a year in the tropics wouldn't fix. Much damage? You should see the damage, Bronze! Metal damage, brain damage? You listening, Bronze? I am the Nightrider! I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine. I am a rocker! I am a roller! I am an out-of-controller! I am the Nightrider, baby, and it's me and Marmaduke, and we ain't never coming back. The Toecutter, he knows who I am. I am the Nightrider! I am the chosen one, the mighty hand of vengeance sent down to strike the unroadworthy! I'm hotter than a rolling dice. Step right up, chum, and watch the kid lay down a rubber road right to freedom! What's wrong? - Baby, what's wrong? - Nothing. It's going... It's going to... There'll be nothing left. It's all gone. Stop! That feels good. After three days, that feels so good. I got a right hook in the mouth this morning. Sprog? I told him to always lead with his left. You know, I think we've got a monster on our hands. Yeah, takes after his old man. What's that? Monster! Montazano, who called himself the Nightrider, had broken from custody and escaped in the police vehicle. You made the news again. He was awaiting arraignment on charges relating to the slaying... - Who was he? - I don't know. ...of a Main Force Patrol officer in a road blockade accident last month. Just another glory rider, I guess. This was the third episode in the Sun City sectors in the past 27 days. Jessie, I told you. The Goose wants me there early. What for, he didn't say. You know the Goose. Coffee's ready. I'm not grumpy. Get out of here. Okay. I gotta go. What's that? Crazy about you. All supplies must be requisitioned from the people's bond. Please do not exploit your privileges. Doing so is an offense. Memorandum Seven: The Captains of the Hall have asked that pursuit officers refrain from using the slang "Bronze" for the Main Force Patrol.

MFP personnel may sign on with the following sector captains. One, six-three, two-four, one-one-two, five-seven and two-six. Kick it in the guts, Barry. She's the last of the V8s. You can shut the gate on this one, Max. It's the duck's guts. Yeah, she's the last of the V8s. Sucks nitro. Phase 4 head. - Twin overhead cam. - Tell him about the blower. - 600 horsepower through the wheel. - The blower, man. She's meanness put to music and the bitch is born to run. - He's in a coma, man! - He loves it. Okay. How the hell did you get all this together? It just happened, Max, you know? A piece from here and a piece from there. - So easy? - Yeah. Come on, Max. You've seen it. You've heard it and you're still asking questions. When do we go for a ride? He loves it. I think we've got him. I hope so. Yeah, we've got him. Your top pursuit man wants to quit the road and we have to seduce him with candy? People don't believe in heroes anymore. I know, Macaffee. You want to give them back their heroes. You will not try this one on me again. I do not enjoy wasting money. Goodbye and good luck! Thanks, Labatouche. You're a real human being. Get out of my way! The old meat grinder's humming tonight? Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies over the high side. Will you shut up! The hot mops and the towees. It's in the food. Hey, Max, another one for your books, eh? Have you eaten yet? No, not yet. I'll pick up something later. That Code 3 you ran down a few days ago... - The Nightrider? - The Nightrider, yeah. - Got a problem. - What's that? His friends. Word is they're out to get you. - Scoot jockeys? - Yeah, nomad trash. Well, I'll add it to my threat collection. Good boy, Max. You're a good boy. Come on. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. We're here to meet a friend. Come in on the train. Nothing come in on the train except a couple of crates and a... coffin. Our friend. You'll have to see the agent and sign the papers. Where do we find this agent? Wait. That must be your friend over there. They didn't leave much of him. Must have cut his heart out, eh? Yes, that's what I meant. Poor bastard. The Nightrider. That is his name. The Nightrider. The Nightrider. Remember him when you look at the night sky. I will. Take your hat off. Anything you say. Anything I say. What a wonderful philosophy you have. Take him away. Bubba. Johnny. Push me, shove you! Oh, yeah? Says who? Push me, shove you! Oh, yeah? Says who? Push me, shove you! Oh, yeah? Says who? Nightrider! Nightrider! Nightrider! No worries. Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.

This one's whacked right out of his skull. Whacked right out of his skull, man! He ain't never coming back. It's all right. I'm gonna let this go now. I know you're frightened, girl, but no one's gonna hurt you anymore. My name's Jim Goose, and everything's gonna be all right. The Nightrider! Hey, Jimbo. - Remember that Code 3? - Yeah. Remember him when you look up... When you look... Nightrider! Well, well, well. Johnny the Boy has done it again. This time it's a scrubber. He's never gonna learn. But we are going to teach him, Bubba. You are going back for him. No way! Not me, not for him! But it's not for him. It's for me, Bubba. You're wasting your time! The Scag don't rate! He's nothing like the Nightrider! Code 7 progress, eight-one. Code 7 progress, eight-three. Code 7, eight-six, eight-one, eight-zero. MFP Code 1. Captain Macaffee in convoy from the courthouse to the Halls of Justice. Code 1 progress. Hey, mister. What happened to the car? What do you think happened? Looks like it was chewed up and spat out. Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety. Hey, Roop. Stay here, mate. I think they're out there. Take your time, Charlie. We got plenty of it. Good day and good luck. I can see the Interceptor. What do you say, Scag? Got no place special to go? We'd better prep him. Scag, did you bring your toothbrush? - You'll have to sit on the Goose. - Why? No contest. Hey, Fif! What's going on? - What happened? - Let him go, Charlie. What's he mean, "Let him go"? Who's this? - Keep out of this. - What's going on? No one showed, okay? Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go. Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go. No one showed. No one. What's he mean, "No one showed"? They didn't show. Nobody! The punks didn't show. The girl didn't show, the townspeople didn't show. Nobody showed! We're screwed! It's the law. What do you mean, "No one showed"? Where were you, man? It means, old man, you haven't got a case. No contest. Jesus Christ! You're not gonna let him walk out the door, Fifi? That's exactly what you're going to do! - Shut up! - Keep going, Charlie! It's all right. Hey, Bronze, look at you, a cripple and a mute! Scag, he sings and I tap dance! Hey, you know that you're wrong! The courts will hear about this. I promise they'll hear about this disgrace. He wearing that face for a bet or does he really look that stupid? This man is grossly offensive! Get him out of here, Max! - I can make a case of it! - What case, you fool? You saw what they did to that girl! For God's sake, she was the town bike! He's my prisoner, and he's not walking out that door! - Get him out of here! - Who is this guy? Goose, settle down, boy. Jesus, Fifi. Fifi, Jesus. Look, they're laughing at us! Can't you see they're laughing at us? They don't believe us! See you later, Goose. It's been a pleasure. Skiffington, go home. Go. Goose! You can't do anything about it! We know who you are, Bronze! We'll see you on the road, Scag! See you on the road like we saw the Nightrider! We remember the Nightrider, and we know who you are! Okay. So long as the paperwork is clean, you boys can do what you like out there. Hey, here he is, the walking armpit! There's a fire in my belly, and she's the woman to put it out. Off, brute! This angel is hot in the tubes for me! I'm on fire, I'm on fire! Joviality is a game of children. She's mine. I should have been a surgeon with these hands. Mudguts, get out of there! Cundalini, put her against the post. We have a problem here. She is not what she seems. Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority she's sent by the Bronze, full of treachery. The Bronze take our pride. If you're gonna waste the Bronze, you gotta do it big! You just don't have the style, do you, chicken shit? Goes to water on a dummy. It's all right. It's okay. Just remember to keep your sweet, sweet mouth shut! MFP to Gosling One. Main Force Patrol to Gosling One. We have a curfew violation. MFP, Gosling One. Gosling One. Code 333 in progress. Main Force. Would someone inform the Goose... Yeah, baby! All units again progress. All units again progress. ...units to Three Day Angel Patrol. Nice to have you back, Big Bopper Two. Sun City Sector 3, Code 4 Trauma in progress. Sun City Sector 9, Code 4 in progress. MFP eight-one. A memorandum: For the cannibalization... MFP, copy. Hey, it's the Goose. You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash. Hey, Midge, don't write off the Goose until you see the box going into the hole. Yeah, well, don't wreck my truck now. - I'll bring it back tomorrow. - Yeah, no hurry. Hey, you sure you're all right? Couldn't be righter. Jimmy the Goose, larger than life and twice as ugly! Light me, Johnny. Light another. This is a threshold moment, Johnny. Step through. Toecutter, this isn't what I want. Light it! The Bronze, they keep you from being proud. Look at him. He looks silly, doesn't he, upside down? - Do it for freedom and the Nightrider! - I can't. - Throw it. - No! You scum-sucking trash! Throw it! I can't stand the pain! Max. Max! Hey, Max! That thing in there, that's not the Goose. No way. I was hungry. Peanut butter and honey. I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess. He was so full of living, you know. He ran the franchise on it. Now there's nothing. Here I am, trying to put sense to it when I know there isn't any. I'll be all right, once I get it clear in my head. Fifi. - What's this? - I'm through. - Again? - No, not again. - I'm through. I'm quitting. - Sit down. No, I didn't come here to discuss it, I came to say it. I'm through. Now, just a minute! All right, so the Goose bought it. That's the way he always came at the world. Off beat. Max, you'd be the first to admit it was long overdue. All right, I'll tell you how it is. You're a winner, Max. You're on the top shelf and I'm not gonna lose you because of some crazy notion about quitting! They say people don't believe in heroes anymore. Well, damn them! You and me, Max, we're gonna give them back their heroes. Do you really expect me to go for that crap? You gotta admit, I sounded good there for a minute? Bye, Fifi. Come on, do you want me to beg? Do you want me on my knees, crying? Now just a minute. Give me a reason. I'm scared, Fif. Do you know why? It's that rat circus out there. I'm beginning to enjoy it. What is this, funny week? Any longer out on that road, and I'm one of them, you know? A terminal crazy. Only I've got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys. You know what I'm trying to say? I'll tell you what I'll do. Take off a few weeks. Grow yourself a beard. Draw flies. Just think about it for a while. If you still feel the same way when you come back, it's okay by me. Go on. I'm not gonna change my mind. Get out of here before I decide to come with you. Bye, Fif. Thank you. You'll be back, Rockatansky! You're hooked, Max. And you know it! I've never been able to say things to you, Jess, about how I feel. Guess I always counted on you understanding. When I was a kid, me and my father used to go for long walks. I remember staring down at his shoes. They were special shoes, brown. And he always kept them really shiny. He was tall, and he used to take long strides. And there I'd be right alongside him just trying to keep up with him. I don't think he ever knew how proud I felt of him. Or how good it felt just to be there alongside him. Even now, when I think back on it, I still feel... The thing is, Jess, I couldn't tell him about it then, but I can tell you about it now. I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you how I'm feeling about you right now. Hello. Get a load of that! We had a blowout a while back. Raunchy, very raunchy. What's the donk like? Yeah, the donk's fine. Look, about this tire... Don't do much work on these myself, except to scrape them off the road. Yeah. Hey, how about this tire? Have it fixed in no time. I can sell you a set of 'lops for next to nothing. No, thanks. I can't remember where I got them, but I got them, know what I mean? No, we'll be all right just as soon as we get this fixed. - Max? - Yeah? Listen, Sproggo's talked me into buying him an ice cream, so, I think I'll see you later. Sure, there's a shop just down the beach. They'll appreciate the business. Sure, thanks. Toodlepip. - You just trucking around? - Yeah. Good time for just trucking. Wish I could do a bit myself. Which way you heading? North? Maybe. Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner. Main course and dessert. My favorite kind: Female. Watch the tongue, lovable. I've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean. Must've spent some coin. Like the sign says, speed's just a question of money. How fast do you wanna go? - Max, quick, get in. - What's wrong? Just take my word for it, get in! - What about the tire? - Please, Max! Your tire, man. Hey, fella, what about your tire? Crazy people! The world's full of crazy people. That wagon, was it here? - Sure, a couple with a kid. - Who are... I was just fixing their tire. They left their goddamn spare. Not a bad one either. Who are they? A couple, passing through. Said they were heading north. Maybe. You want to drive the car? Yeah? Well, we wouldn't have a car anymore. Into the back. Here you go. I can still see his face now. Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick. What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss? That's enough from you, mate! Enough. What's the matter with you? What you got there, mate? Max! Yeah, that's the way I see it, too. Sure. It's been nice talking to you. Bye. Take it you agreed with him. They're not worried, I'm not worried. What about that? I figure it's lost property. If no one makes a claim to it, I say we can forget it. Sounds okay to me, Jess. Don't know. If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay. May's expecting you up at the farm sometime. You'll have no trouble up there. Just green grass. How are you doing? I'm getting there. I reckon you ought to connect the doohickey to the gizmo. Come here, you. You touch me with those hands and I'll rip you apart. No! Look at them! No! May told me about the little beach down by the trees. Do you want to come? Love to. Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt, or we're never gonna get out of here. Okay, Tarzan, I'll bring you back some bananas. Do that. Jessie. If you meet Benno down there, don't let him trouble you. He's only a baby. Sure, May. - The men. - What men? Come on. Now you calm down and you tell me what's the matter. Very, very naughty. - Now, you tell May what you... - May. May, you call The Dark One. And you tell him to get here as fast as he can. Why? What's going on? I think we've got some hoon trouble. It's gonna be all right. Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie. Well, let's go into the house. You've had an awful time, darling. But it's all over now. Everything's going to be all right. I've just got to go and make a phone call and then we'll have a nice hot cup of tea. The Dark One, and hurry it up, will you? It's May Swaisey. Sprog? Oh, no! Sprog! Well, well, well. It's our little mother. That there is Cundalini and Cundalini wants his hand back. I want my baby. Tell you what, I'll swap you. Please, give me my baby. Jessie. Jessie, Jessie. You've not got a sense of humor. You've got a pretty face, though. Awful pretty. Awful pretty. I suppose you don't need a sense of humor with a pretty face. The only trouble is though, missy, if you should lose the face... Please, don't hurt my baby. You've got nothing! What do you want from me? - Don't change the subject. - Hold it! Right there! - I hate guns. - Old lady. Stand back! - Stay back! - Woman! Stay back! Anyone so much as breathes, I'll cheese him! Open that door. Every one of you, in there. Put the babe on the ground. Jessie, get the van. Don't stop. Just go right through it. Now what? - The motor! - What are you trying to say? I don't know, it just died on me. Get out. Run! Jessie! Where? Lord, have mercy! What do you reckon? I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller. This your subdural? - Yes, that's her. - Lot of problems? Multiple traumas, spleen, liver, lung, flail chest, left neck of femur, renal shutdown. Reads like a grocery list. She salvageable? Yeah, sure, we got all her signs back last night. - Relatives? - The husband. They lost the kid. DOA. Listen, tell him she's going to be all right. Tell him not to worry. If he wants, I'll talk to him. I don't think he wants to talk to anyone. He's been standing there like a zombie all day. Bubba Zanetti, is that you? You come for the grunt? She won't be ready until this afternoon. Still having trouble with the front forks. They're mongrels to work with. You asshole! What the molly fuck you think you're doing? You and me are gonna talk about the Toecutter. Never heard of him. What the Christ are you? I wanna know about the tattoo. I mind my own business, don't I? I mean, they'll kill me, won't they? I'll say the names, and you say "yes" or "no." Nightrider, - Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti. - Yes. There's more? - Johnny. - Johnny the Boy? - Yeah. Some others. - Where? Out at the beaches, looking for fuel. Are they coming back? I don't know. They gotta get their bikes. - What time? - For Christ's sake! - What time? - I don't know. Code unspecified. We have a query locate on a black Pursuit Special. Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer. This is designated as a potential Code 3 Red Alert. Quit toying, Bubba. Easy. I know what I'm doing. Hi. This isn't what it looks, man. I just came down here to check it out, and this guy, he's already snuffed it. Nothing you could do for him. Ankle. It's okay. What are you doing, man? Hey, listen, I had nothing to do with anything going on back there, man. Listen, man, will you? Listen, will you listen to me? There were a hell of a lot of crazy people back there, man. Some kind of bad people. I'm not responsible for anything. What are you doing, man? What did you say? What are you doing? Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man. I'm sick, see? Sick. What do you call it? Psychopathic, you know. Personality disorder. The judge, man, he said so. You're not gonna hurt me, are you? Jesus! You can't kill me! Not for stealing a man's boots! He was dead, for Christ's sake! He won't need them anymore. What are you doing? I wanna know what you're doing. The chain in those handcuffs is high-tensile steel. It'd take you ten minutes to hack through it with this. Now, if you're lucky, you could hack through your ankle in five minutes. Go. You're mad, man! You think I look silly, don't you? Don't bring this on me, man. Don't do this to me, please! Sweet Jesus. I was sick! Don't bring this on me, please!
