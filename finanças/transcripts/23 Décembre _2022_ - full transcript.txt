PRODUCED WITH FINANCING FROM PRODUCED IN COLLABORATION WITH IMMINA FILMS PRESENTS A MÉDIA FILMS PRODUCTION Every year, it's the same thing. All the pressure, the stress. We're ready for you on set, Mr. Blouin. We rush to tie up loose ends, decorate the house and buy presents... Come on, get up! Hurry! I don't want to be late to practice. We want everything to be perfect. Until it blows up in our face. By then, we're fed up with the carols we've been hearing since Halloween. Why do we do this to ourselves? We are beginning our descent into Montreal. It is currently -7ºC, and a snow storm is expected. Thank you for flying with us. Happy holidays! But like they say, we'll all get to Christmas at the same time. We'll be OK, we'll survive. In a few years, we'll forget the details. And we'll ask each other, "Remember that? It was so magical!" Merry Christmas! It never changes! Every year, the same thing! - Then get a new wife! You're like your mother! - Excuse me?! No, no, no! No, you cut us off, I saw it. Don't cry, you'll get it back. I promise. You'll find it underneath the tree. Smile! How rude! TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS A GUILLAUME LESPÉRANCE PRODUCTION ORIGINAL IDEA AND SCRIPT BY INDIA DESJARDINS DIRECTED BY MIRYAM BOUCHARD In two minutes, you're on air with the Saguenay morning show. They're calling my cell. After the signing later, the promo will be done and you can relax. I'm going to miss you! - Me too! Some change for my elves, that'd be swell. Some change for my... Ah, thanks. - Merry Christmas. That's lovely. Thank you, ma'am. Merry Christmas! FOR MY ELVES A Santa with bad grammar doesn't look good. Who the fuck you think you are? Merry Christmas to both of the ladies. You know the movies where the main character is mean to Santa and bad things happen, then at the end you realize it's because he wanted to teach him a lesson? Yeah... - It made me superstitious. Like you wake up in a parallel life with your college boyfriend and 3 kids? My worst nightmare! We don't have to take lessons from Santa. We can do what we want with our lives! I'm doing great on my own, I'm an independent woman. It's just that... I'm always single at Christmas. And I thought, this year I'd like... a little magic in my life? So now's not the time to piss off Santa and jinx my karma. Your interview... Hello? Yes, here she is. You're on air. Hello! Yes, that's right, it's a book about teens' reality, about finding your place and often feeling misunderstood... Are you listening to me? Mikaël, yoo hoo! You're driving Dad to the airport and won't have time to pick me up from practice, so I'm meeting you at... The Nutcracker. Starting vacation off right! Hey, Mom... I'm not really feeling the show this year... What? It's our tradition! That's just it... You said yes months ago! You can't change your mind at the last minute. If you didn't want to go, you should have said so before. I know you're angry with your father for leaving, but he's doing it for us, so we can have a good life. It's working. Life is fucking nice. Language! For the swear jar. Bundle up! Good evening, and welcome to everyone watching at home. We're here to celebrate Christmas along with special guests, surprises, and... - Cut! Cut! - Let's try that again. Problem with the sound! - No worries. Standby, everyone. We're back in 5. You'll announce Antoine Blouin. He's back with a new Christmas album, then... You OK? Sorry, I'm really on edge. I haven't done a show in so long. I don't even know if the audience remembers me. Better to lose your audience than your health. My wife says the same thing. Everything will be fine. Thanks. - Thank you. Remember, people! It's not the morning of December 23, it's tonight at 9pm, everyone's done with dinner. Let's have fun, OK?! In 5, 4, 3... Good evening, everyone! We're here to celebrate Christmas. Don't miss tonight's show, with special guests and surprises. Let's celebrate Christmas together! I like having more options than "Christmas." Like "the holidays." It's more inclusive and respectful of all traditions. I say "Christmas," and I don't see any reason to change! Damn straight. A society can only benefit from being inclusive. Will we have to start saying "decorative tree" instead of "Christmas tree?" With many Quebecers coming from different cultural backgrounds, why can't we include and respect everybody? We can't please everyone. Come help me instead of yelling at the TV. Does everything have to change? It won't kill us if the tourtière has a gluten-free crust, the Yule log is egg-free organic, or the turkey's free-range and raised locally! I'm talking about "the holidays" instead of "Christmas." I don't think it's hard to say- "Christmas"? What'll they turn Santa into? A distributor of recreational accessories? We didn't do the tree! We usually do it in November. I'll let you finish that in peace while I go cut us a tree. Normand, speaking of trees, the girls... They don't want a Christmas tree this year. Not them too! I think their argument is that it isn't logical to plant trees for the environment and cut them down at Christmas. They do have a point. Oh, shoot! Do I have fair trade organic cocoa powder? That's enough! Stop it. It's important that the chocolate profits the country of origin. You tell the girls to eat what's on the table. If I'd told my mother I wouldn't eat her Christmas meal because of this or that, she'd have said, "Then go hungry, and go to your room!" They only come to Charlevoix once a year! I just want everyone to be together. I have friends whose kids never come home for the holidays... Christmas! When I'm in a nursing home, I don't want to spend Christmas alone because I exploited the poor with my chocolate! So there! There it is! I'm going out to cut a tree, end of story! Don't forget that tonight, the Château Frontenac is hosting a fundraising dinner to help underprivileged families. Tickets are still available for $150! No! - Now onto to the weather... No, no, no! An incoming storm will affect several regions of Quebec. Strong winds are expected- Hello! - Hello. Thank you. What's this? Morning, Chloe! - Marc! I thought you went down south with the family! I'm leaving shortly, I have a few things to finish up. I don't want you to think I don't trust you. - No, no. But the radio is saying that tonight's event costs $150 a ticket. At that price, it wouldn't be the poor receiving charity. I heard, but I double-checked and the press release isn't to blame. It definitely says $350. When you first came to me with the idea, I thought: Marc, don't waste your time. But then I thought: No, no, it's cute. After all, it's a noble cause. And having fresh ideas is good for the hotel. It's important to get involved. It isn't just about the image. Absolutely. But the reality is that now, with sites like Trip Advisor, we're one cold brew away from a bad review. Since I hired you, our ratings have dropped from 4.7 to 4.2. When you asked me to give you a shot at running the hotel, we'd said until... Christmas. - Christmas. We're there. - Yeah... I still have 48 hours. You know how to reach me. Cell. Email. I'll let you know if I need help, but rest assured it's under control, Marc. I won't be intimidated by privileged white men. Hello, Stephanie! And... - Alex. Alex, right. I'm Dr. Desharnais. So... It might be a little cold. Breathe normally. Shy little thing, won't let me get a picture. That tickles! Sorry. I make a lot of people laugh with my probe. If I didn't go into medicine, I think I'd do stand-up. Good evening. A round of applause... Does everything look good? Is the heart beating? - Everything's fine. Strong heartbeat. So that's the little face that'll turn our lives upside down. Relax, you're not the one who has to stop working for a year. It's really moving! Is that bad? Is there a problem? Oh no, the baby's in great shape. It's just that with active babies, if you're worried about a little chaos it might be time to start the grieving process. When you say... "the grieving process"... Like dinners with friends, nights out, travelling... All that? Sleep, relationship, spontaneity. Everything looks good. Do you want to know the sex? We know about sex. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. Let the dad jokes begin. So basically baby's healthy but our life's over. Should we file a complaint with the Medical College? Who says stuff like that? Maybe it was just a way to warn us. I doubt they do stand-up in skydiving schools like, "Get ready, kiddo, because you might die." I mean... we're jumping into the unknown, fine, but can't they tell us everything will be OK? Everything will be fine. But couldn't we postpone seeing your family by one day? What's that got to do with anything? It's our last Christmas together before we kiss our lives goodbye. Honestly. Come on! We'll spend the day together, just the two of us. We'll have sex, watch a movie, have sex... play a game, have sex, hang around, have sex... Good plan. If there's a parental leave competition, we win! And rack up tons of life points, so we can say: "Yo, in your face, Dr. Desharnais, check out our life points!" I said no! I want one! I want one! No means no! I said no! I want one! It won't be that bad... So, can you come over later? My parents won't be home. It's pretty much the last time we'll see each other before New Year's. I'll try. It's no big deal, we'll do it again! You'll miss my hot "Instababe" look. You could be in pjs and you'd still look hot. I was kidding- all I have are jockstraps. I'm meeting a friend. If the signing takes a while, could you tell him to wait? Sure, what does he look like? He's easy to recognize: attractive, dresses in business casual, and he'll probably be the only one without kids. We've been doing promo for a month, and you've never mentioned a guy. We have other things to talk about. Could this be Mr. Christmas Magic? My boss is coming. You can wait here. Thank you. He's just a friend. A childhood friend. We see each other once a year, he lives in London. I had a crush on him when I was 9. And now? - I'm not 9 anymore. He made out with Camille Gendron in grade 6. Goddamn Camille Gendron. You know her too? No, but we all have a Camille Gendron. Mine was Carolane Potvin. Goddamn Carolane Potvin! All the boys wanted to go out with Gendron/Potvin! I know! Well? Well?! I told you! Not too rusty? You didn't have to drive me, I could've taken a taxi. Stop... This way, we can spend some time together before you leave. Life on the road again. After your tour, let's book a trip! Let's go back to Italy! To what extent are you... friends? We're friends friends. Seeing each other 45 minutes a year isn't what I call a great friendship. We always have fun together, but... he lives far away. I still have my 9-year-old crush. But he was never interested, so friends. But these things change. Sometimes I feel like going: So, the two of us... What's that? Why don't you ask him on a... real date? With wine. I'm no good at that, I've been single for too long. Start by taking off the big sweater. Do you have anything underneath? Take it off. Show some skin and see if he checks you out. Objectification! That goes against all my values! It's called empowerment! This is a long-term seduction. By 70, I might have a chance. Why is it that you can be perfectly happy 51 weeks a year, but if you're single between Christmas and New Year's, you feel like shit and question all your life choices? I'll tell you what's shit. It's the holiday season making us feel like shit! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU! I can't take it. It's just one day. I feel bad. Of course you do: your mother made you feel guilty when you didn't tell her you cut your hair. It was a pretty drastic haircut. Whether we're late by a day or a week, she'll make us feel guilty anyway. You know your family always ends up fighting. No! Fine, but I still feel guilty. We have the right to spend time together before our life ends. Imagine in 30 years our kid skips Christmas after all our sacrifices and that we're hurt... Whoa, whoa, don't go there. Let's focus on today and deal with karma tomorrow. Not now. Hello? - Hi, Mom. Hi sweetie! How are you? - Good! I'm good! A little busy, but good! You should see it, I bought enough food to feed an army! Yeah. What were you saying? I was thinking we'd come tomorrow, not today... Oh, that's fine. You could have told me earlier, now we'll have leftovers. You know how I hate to waste food... It's fine if you don't want to come today. It's your life, it's... I've got to run. Talk to you later! Normand?! Are you OK?! Normand?! It's my husband. I don't know, he fell, he's unconscious! Maggie should be there, I don't understand. My biggest problem isn't that it's non-refundable! Thanks. The room's design is coming along as planned. I called the radio station and they'll air a correction. I called the auctioneer, and he's coming early. The rest of the auction items will be delivered within the hour. Has the chef arrived? Yes... Thank you. Where's Gabrielle? - Over there. Thanks. Me too, I still love you. Where's Maggie? Daycare called, she's not there. - Don't worry, she's safe. Oh? When we were together, you never wanted to do it in the fridge... Stop it, I have no time for this today! We had an agreement. Trust me. In a kitchen, I trust you entirely. For the rest, no. Come on. There's my doggie! There you are! I was so worried! There was a super aggressive dog at daycare, so I didn't want to leave her there. Why didn't you tell me? - She's not bothering anyone. Oh no! She's not staying here, what if there's an inspection? Then we'll just say she's on the menu. Eh, Maggie? You know how much I fought for this job. That I do. I don't understand how you can be so irresponsible on a day like today. It's December 23, there won't be an inspection. Stop freaking out. You're right, you're right. See? - This whole thing is ridiculous. Doggie daycare, joint custody, anybody would think we're a pair of goddamn hippies. Who cares what people think? They don't know our life. I want full custody of Maggie. What? Otherwise we'll never fully separate, we need a clean break. Why you and not me? I bought her! "Adopted." She's not a thing! And you know why. We were in it together, you don't have a monopoly on suffering. I can find work wherever, so if you want my resignation, I'll give it to you. But we're not changing anything for Maggie. Thank you. Hello. - Hello! Your books aren't, like, torture! Thank you! Happy holidays! Hello! Hey. How are you? - Good, you? Yeah. "I'm single by choice because I'm happy on my own!" They left something out. FOR THE MOMENT. Do you do this to all the magazines? It sucks to be misquoted. I'm proud of you. Who'd have thought the weirdest girl in school would... Weird?! Me? You were the only one who wore zebra-striped glasses. Call it "avant-garde"! And you remember that? That doesn't work. If we put the gifts there, the DJ can't be behind them. Can you fix it? Thanks. Yes, Chloe? Be fierce when you place those gifts! Right... We're missing chairs. At least half! We have a contract, did you call the supplier? I'm waiting for a call back. I know you're doing your best. I know. I know. We'll get there! We'll get there! Thank you! We'll get there. Yes, we'll get there. We'll get there, won't we? If it isn't my favourite PR officer. I'm glad you're on time. Shall I go over your schedule? You have an interview at... - First, coffee. It's Antoine Blouin! I know! Hello. - Hello. The problem is your pacemaker. Charlevoix is a frontline hospital, so we don't have a cardiologist on site. We've stabilized you. We'll do an emergency transfer to Quebec City. They have an excellent cardio department. Can I go with him? I'd advise you to meet him there with his belongings. We'll take good care of him. Thank you. - Good luck, you'll be fine. I left the tourtière in the oven, the house'll catch fire! My heart's fine, thanks. I'm sorry, sweetie. Do you want the booth? - No. Sure? I'm a 34-year-old man, I've accepted the fact that I can no longer take the booth. My parents are old so when we eat out, I give them the booth. My brothers are younger and less mature, so I give them the booth... I want my clients to be comfortable, so... booth. And with a girl, what would I look like if I took the booth? So it's about appearances? It's about timing! When I was 7 I got the booth, totally unaware of my privilege. Now I'm waiting for the day I'll get it back... Life's tough! So? How are you? I've got a lot on my mind... I have college friends who want to offer me a job at a firm here. I'm meeting them tonight in Quebec City. So you want to move back? If I do, it would mean a pay cut... But I miss my family and friends. I feel like I'm at a turning point. If I move back, it'd be for something big, like meeting the girl of my dreams. Oh yeah? - Yeah. What about you? MOM Well... I work all the time. Don't you ever wish you could find a good work/life balance? It's just because it's my mom and... Hello? Normand had a heart attack. They are transferring him to Quebec City. Oh my gosh, is it serious? - I don't know, I didn't catch everything. We're on our way. What's wrong? It's Normand... We've known each other since we were, what, 9? 9, yeah. You haven't changed since then. No, it's true. You never cared about what everybody else thought. I wish I had your guts. Is it me, or is it... hot in here? I'm just going to... Oops! Do you need any help? No, I'm good. It always does that... Winter, static... MOM So... when do you go back? I'm staying a few days. I'm debating between staying in Quebec for New Year's or partying with friends in London. Another dilemma. Are you going to Quebec City to see your father? We could drive up together. No, this year I'm only going to Charlevoix. My dad rented a cottage near my mom, it's easier that way. Divorce complicates Christmas. And everyone always wonders why we're so cynical. Listen, David.... We see each other once a year... we recap our lives and rush between meetings... We're not even really friends. What I'm trying to say is... Why don't we go on a date? You know, a real date with wine and more time and all. Just to see whether... There's anything more... It might be important. Hello. - You're not easy to reach. Normand had a heart attack, he's in an ambulance. They're transferring him to Quebec City. Don't come to Charlevoix. - OK... Meet me in Quebec City. - Yes, of course. At the hospital! - OK. I've gotta go. Family emergency. Wait, hang on. And forget what I said. No, wait... I bet everything's booked, but I'm on it, don't worry! But Elsa, you'll never find a hotel. Shit, shit! Yes, I know, I'm calm. Bye! See you at the hospital. Quebec City, Gate 8. Sorry. Quebec City. Excuse me, are you alone? Do you mind changing seats? Jesus! Find a better place to stand! NO AVAILABILITY Everything OK? Yes, don't worry. I was happy to see you :-) Me too. See you next year! XX Quebec City is proud to welcome singer Antoine Blouin. He'll be performing at the Château Frontenac's fundraiser tonight, but he'll be on our show right before that. Don't miss it! What is that? Jeez... Oh, my God. Are you OK? What a silly question, of course you're not OK. I'm sorry! Come on! I'm calling to report a car accident. Are you safe? - Yes. How many victims, ma'am? One, just one person. - Any injuries? An accident... Yes, he's injured. Can you describe his condition? Yes... Sir, are you able to talk? He's not too chatty... What kind of accident? - It was a pretty big accident. Is he exposed to the cold? - Yes. Do you have something to cover him? Yes, I found something. Here. Done. What next? We've located you. Help is on the way. Thank you. Someone will be here soon. This'll keep you warm, it's a Ricardo tablecloth, top quality. Don't worry, I'll stay with you until help arrives. The thing is that the third wave... It's like coffee beans, but not as dark. Microroasting is kind of like microbrewing with beer. So basically the third wave is just coffee? Yes, that's the beauty of it! You OK? Yes, I'm just curious... Do I have the right to refuse treatment from you? From me? You mean... From someone with a degree in prehospital emergency care? To accommodate me. I'm not sure I understand. You want to refuse care? I didn't say that, it's just that some people... want accommodations. It's a question for my... personal culture. It isn't you in particular. I get it, it's not me so it must be Sebas! What? He's bothering you with his hipster talk about coffee. Me, too. Sebas, the patient wants to know if he can refuse care from a wannabe barista. First, I'm not a hipster. That's the definition of hipster: someone who thinks they're not a hipster. But I'm not! Besides, I don't think anyone says hipster anymore. What do you call a guy who looks like a hipster and talks about coffee for... a half hour? An enthusiast. Don't worry, Mr. Gauthier, he'll stop bothering you. In the meantime, I have to take your blood pressure. May I? Hello, friend! - Hey, you OK? You sound out of breath. I'm so overwhelmed, you have no idea. And my ex took the dog... Oh, poor you... I'm on my way to Quebec City... My stepfather had a heart attack. I was wondering if... since your hotel is close to the hospital... I'd love to help, but we're all booked up. I'm willing to take anything. Hang on, let me see if I can find something... OK, yes! OK, I'll take it! That's perfect. Sweetie... Maggie? No, no, no. Hello. Good evening. We ask that everyone find their seat, The Nutcracker will begin momentarily. I'm so happy you could come. Me too... Excuse me. Were you there at the time of the accident? No, after. I listened to my heart and stopped. So you stopped? You weren't part of the accident? What is this, a police interrogation? I'm a police officer, ma'am. I wanted to help, but now I have to go. My husband's in the hospital. Ma'am! We're closing the road, it's too dangerous. The storm's caused multiple accidents. You'll have to wait here until it's plowed. Are you kidding me? I just wanted to be a good Samaritan! It would've been awful to leave before you came, but at least I could have passed! Hey! My Ricardo tablecloth! Ma'am! Get back into your car and let us work! Incredible. You OK? We don't have to if you've changed your mind... That's not it... It's not you... Then what is it? I know something I'm not supposed to. And I can't stop thinking about it. A few weeks ago, I found stuff on my dad's phone. Texts... I don't know what to do, it's messing with my head. What kind of texts? Like... cringe. I didn't think he was like that... You're such a perfect family! That's the problem with him. Everyone thinks he's perfect. You didn't misinterpret? - No. It was obvious. And my mom... She's so in love with him, I dunno, she's so... naive. She's not the one to blame! I know, but I don't know if I should tell her. Sometimes I'm about to, but then I choke. We'll need snow removal. Thanks. Antoine Blouin is here. - Great, thanks. Mr. Blouin, it's a pleasure. I'm Chloe Nadeau, General Manager. We're delighted to have you here. Your performance is highly anticipated. The pleasure's all mine. This is Jessica, my press relations officer. Hello. - Hello, pleasure. I've given you the Cadillac of suites, you'll have the Rolls Royce of service. That's very kind. It will be a smooth ride. Please, make yourself at home. Is everything OK? No... If there's anyone here who doesn't have a life, it's that guy. Can we get over the whole "my life's over" thing? Sorry, I didn't realize you were already over it. I'm not, I'm freaking out. My body, my job, my relationship... What about your relationship? Life is always changing... Like when we first started dating, you'd say "bless you." What?! It's no big deal, but I sneezed earlier and you didn't say "bless you." Bless you? I don't want you to feel like you have to say it, I just mean, "bless you" is like the symbol that sometimes, things change. I feel like it's an expression that casts a wide net all of a sudden. Bless you. What? You're the one questioning our whole life because of... What life? Last I heard, ours was over. Well, then. How're you doing? - Come on! No, no, I'll be there tonight. Yeah, yeah. I might return to London for New Year's, I haven't decided yet. My God, tough life. I don't know, it's a big move. I've been there 6 years. No offense, but the salary's peanuts compared to what I'm earning now... It'll take a little more than that to get me to come back. If he has to uproot himself and lose half his salary, it's a big move. A major life change! There's another thing... What now? I dunno, I'm freaking out a little. Me too! Are manners dead or what? Does he think everyone wants to hear about his boring life like it's reality TV? I saw a friend this morning, and she said a lot of stuff. You weren't talking about the guy? No. It was like a declaration of love... I dunno, it's weird... A childhood friend. Maybe I misunderstood... I don't understand why you're freaking out. Suddenly I'm a single father because I don't say "bless you"! It's symbolic! I got your text. What is it? I lost Maggie. - Now who's the irresponsible one? Stop, that's not funny! You lost a dog in Quebec City's premier hotel. Worst case, she gets a pedicure! What if something happens, what if there are complaints? Calm down, breathe. Nothing's going to happen. Maggie loves people. - Yeah. She'd never bite anyone. - No. I promise... There's been an accident. Oh my God, she bit a guest! I knew it! We're gonna be sued! Bit? - No, Maggie would never. Maggie? Sir, how can we help you? Can we call an ambulance? Where were you bitten? - I wasn't bitten! The accident? - Accident... Alex... You said there'd been an accident with a guest. No, I said "incident." I'm pretty sure you said "accident." I was talking about this. What did the dog look like? - Are you kidding? Maggie would never have done that. How many dogs did you bring into the hotel, Gabrielle? Trust me. What colour was the dog? - Grey. Let me introduce our... head chef and... Director of Internal Investigations. I think we can go now. What time did you see the dog? - OK, that's enough now. We'll send up a tray of sweets, made by the chef. Another reason we bring her in when there are... glitches. Good evening. Oh no! Oh no! Help! Help! Here! Over here! Quick! Hurry! Is there another victim? - Yes, look! There's blood and tracks leading into the forest! We don't take care of animals, ma'am. But we can't just let it die! You don't understand, maybe it's a mother... You're going to leave the babies alone in the forest? Isn't there some organization we can call? Do something, alert the SPCA, I don't know! Our job is to take care of accident victims. You're going to let a poor injured mother die? I've already asked you to return to your vehicle and let us do our job. You're being cruel! We're stuck here for hours, and now you're going to let a poor animal die! Isn't that a dead turkey? Storms aren't what they used to be. These days, people see a few snowflakes and they panic. Tell me about it! When I was little, school wouldn't close unless it was buried under snow. Now 3 flakes fall, and it's a snow day. There's snow in your country? I'm from Quebec. My parents were born in Tunisia. It does snow in Tunisia in some places. That must be where the expression comes from: "Where are you going in the desert with your skis?" So he's a hipster and you make boomer puns. I'm not a hipster! Well I'm a baby boomer, and proud of it. We're a generation of builders! How do you celebrate Christmas Eve in your family? We have a big dinner, but it's complicated with work... I don't know if I'll make it tomorrow night. But why do you celebrate Chr... the holidays? For tradition. And it's a good excuse for a family dinner. Tradition? Then why do you want to change all the words? Like "the holidays" instead of "Christmas"? First, I don't want to change them, I'm not the one who decided. I call Christmas... Christmas. Me too. You see? We're the same. Well, almost. You seem like a real Christmas lover. Not at all. My wife works like a dog for her daughters. You'd need a degree in nutrition to figure out the shopping list. Me, I'd rather just take a cruise. You don't like Christmas, you'd rather skip it, but you're adamant about keeping the words. More or less. It's because of grinches like you that we're changing the words. Me, I'd love to have a nice dinner with my family. But I don't think that'll happen. You're very sweet. Mr. Gauthier? He's coding! We have a patient in cardiac arrest. Mr. Gauthier! Stay with me! Talk to me, Mr. Gauthier! Welcome to the Château Frontenac, Mr. Blouin. You're singing for the needy, and they give you all this? I'll never understand. Give it to them! No time. You're off to make your grandmother's pudding chômeur. Right. My grandmother. I found a recipe on Pinterest. After this tour... Nobody will remember you were ever sick. Good. - Yes. I love you... Hang on. Sorry. Hey, Mik, what's up? I know what you did. What are you talking about? You know. I'm doing an interview, can we talk when I get back? Mom and I were there when you were always on tour. We were there when you were sick, when you released the Christmas album, like all the has-been losers. I'm fed up with your finger pointing and pouting. We'll talk later. You're fed up? Well me too! I'm telling Mom. - Hang on, listen. Wait until I'm back. We'll talk then. Mik? Mikaël?! Good luck, Mr. Gauthier... You recently experienced some health issues? That's right. We know you are very family-oriented, so I imagine that their support was important? My wife and son were incredibly supportive. In these moments, we realize our ambitions aren't the ones holding our hand at the hospital. Thanks very much for being with us today. Thank you. Hello, I'm here for Normand Gauthier. Are you family? Not blood. He's my stepfather, so family-ish, kind of. Does that count? He's in the ICU. There were complications. Complications? Was it bad? Is he OK? We couldn't get in touch with his spouse. My mother isn't here? - No. Weird. Mom, where are you? I'm at the hospital and you're not here! Sift the flour and baking powder together. Like this. Nice and easy. Then, cream the butter. Slowly add sugar and beat until smooth. I'm sure it will be delicious! You'll have to tell my grandmother, it's her recipe. You're making a comeback with your new Christmas album. Very original, I might add. Why Christmas? - It was either that or 80s hits. Can you play a bit for us? I wouldn't. - Come on! Don't make us beg. Well, if you insist. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride - Maggie! In a one-horse open sleigh, hey! Maggie, come here sweetie! Come here, girl! All of this is your fault! All you care about is yourself! It's always "relax, everything's fine!" Then who has to clean up your shit? Me! Fine, it's my fault. You were the one not watching Maggie. You're always working, always on your phone. You think you're so perfect... But you don't care about anything except work. At least I have a little fun! It's pointless... It's so pointless. I don't know why, but the two of us fighting three floors underground, it's like a metaphor for our relationship. This year's holiday season just reminds me of the family we'll never have... We weren't made to be a family. Look at what happened with Maggie. She was supposed to help take our mind off things while we were trying. Yeah, but what we were going through wasn't easy. All the fertility treatments, the hormones, the waiting, the anxiety, the disappointment, everyone overloading us with advice and herbal teas. Your new job, your stress... we could have given ourselves another chance. But you're never there! You come home at 5 a.m. I would have changed with a baby. No, we don't change. Would you have worked any less? Maybe we weren't cut out for that life. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? You're right, I was the one who lost Maggie, it's all my fault. I was the one who brought her here. I'm sorry. Hello. I tried to corner her. A 22 lb. salmon... How did she do it? Maggie isn't strong enough. She jumped over the table and grabbed the salmon. It was practically an Olympic jump. It was... a beautiful jump. Thank you, Vincent. I'm so glad you're here. Normand's in the ICU, and I can't reach Mom. Have you talked to her? Not since this morning. She left before we did. - I know! What if she had an accident? - Stay calm... I'm calm, you're the one who isn't! - I'm super calm! There must be a logical explanation. Of course there is. Have you spoken to Dad? Can we go to his place? Do you have a key or... No, he's already in Charlevoix. What?! It was a great idea, having us all in the same place! Plus I found us a hotel! Bravo? Excuse me... She's a little worked up today. And a piece of advice: if she sneezes, say "bless you". Bless you. I just talked to Dad. He's already there, he wanted to beat the storm. He says to keep him posted. He says it's the last time he's renting a cottage because it's proof it was a bad plan. Just because someone's sick one time doesn't mean we need to have a million Christmas dinners! Are you complaining when people are dying of hunger? That's how it works. Just because other people are worse off doesn't mean we can't complain! Poor us and all our abundance! That's clearly a sophism. The worst-example fallacy? - So now you're taking her side? No, I'm just trying to find the sophism. I didn't realize this was a quiz! Now I really feel like spending lots of Christmases with you! Do you have an update? Will he be OK? Did our mother ever get here? Listen, the ER is at full capacity today and you're taking up a lot of space. You think? Can you wait elsewhere and we'll contact you with any updates? No, sorry. I'm not going anywhere. I'm pregnant. What? That's got nothing... Little to do with it. Are you having complications? We can register you for triage. No, no, no, but... We'll go. I'll leave you my number. Mom, call us please. Thank you. So much. Follow me. Here you go... Where are the lights? Hang on, I'll get a flashlight. Almost there, voila. Oh, come on. - Everything OK? The switch should be... Is it working? There! Yeah. Like I said, it's the only thing I had left... It's perfect. - Yeah... Don't worry, it's safe. You just have to... Yeah, it's great. For real, it's great. Thank you. No worries. I'm not supposed to let out this room, so if you could, just keep a low profile tonight. If you need a distraction, I can put you on the list for the fundraising dinner. If your stepfather's doing better. We'll think about it... - I'll leave... the keys here. And I'll send you the invite. Good?! - Thank you! I'll let you know if a room opens up. Thanks... - Well then... So this is... A room for all 3 of us? Together? - Yeah, it's... I'm sorry, everything was booked. I thought, since it's right by the hospital... Yeah. If I understand correctly, if we want some intimacy... we do it in here? TMI! We were planning on having a day together, just the two of us. And we've failed miserably across the board! We couldn't even relax on the train because we were sitting behind some annoying dude who kept talking on the phone. Loudly? - Please... He had it all, the volume and the language. The whole wagon heard he was deciding between London and Quebec for New Year's. And his lack of a love life too. And that thing with his childhood friend... Do I annoy everyone with my childhood friends? Never! Well, me sometimes, but never whole wagons! What did he say about his childhood friend? I don't know, who cares? We don't, but he yelled it right into my ears. That's right, it was ridiculous. He was complaining she'd declared her love, but he wasn't interested. Poor girl. - Wish I had his problems! I didn't declare my love! What? - What? You... - What? You know the guy from the train? You know him too. David. - David... My crush in grade 4. I wrote about it in my diary-which I know you read, by the way! You think I'd recognize your grade school friends? It might not be him, you have nothing in common. He's so buttoned up, he looks like a banker. Yeah, and he was so proud to announce that he lives in London to a bunch of people stuck on a train on December 23... Clearly needs validation! In a big way. We need to do something about your taste in men, because... You know what? I think I'm going to leave. You can do whatever you want, all by yourselves. I need some air. - Come on, Elsa... Well. Are you mad at me? You always treat me like I'm 5. I'm not a baby anymore. You might be right. If I let myself, I'd probably still be hiding the elf. When you're 30, I bet you'll laugh about your mother who wanted to get out the elf when you were 15. That's a bit far off to laugh. It's true, I need to get up to date. Sorry, I have to take this. Hello? Cookies? Sorry, we can't accept them. Do you think it'll be much longer? The storm's let up a bit. We have to close the roads until the plows come through. I don't have a signal, I can't get in touch with anyone. Can I borrow your phone? We don't have a signal, either. What about your CB? Not allowed, sorry. I'm going to die here, and nobody will notice! Have you been drinking? You're driving me crazy! I've been stuck here for hours! I had to go pee in the woods, and it's cold outside! All I wanted was to have a nice Christmas! And it killed my husband! You killed your husband? Not me. He's all alone at the hospital, and I can't do anything about it! Get in the car, ma'am. What? - Get in the car. No, wait! I'm innocent! Ma'am... - I didn't do anything! That's enough, I'm bringing her to the station. Hey, listen, no, no... - Watch your head. I don't understand, what's happening? You can't arrest me, I didn't do anything! Look, I'll bring you into the station and we'll see about getting you to the hospital. You can do that? By the way, the cookies looked good. We have some time before the fundraiser. Want to grab a drink? Jessica... - Hello... I didn't know you'd be here. It's a long story, but... What a coincidence, same hotel. Yes... Hello, I'm Elsa, another client of Jessica's. Good evening. Hi. I got your text and we can push the performance back 30 minutes. Thank you. This is my friend, the hotel manager. This is my press relations officer. Yes, we met earlier. Small world! Hold the flowers. Would you like to go over tonight's program? Don't say anything. I don't understand why you didn't tell me. If people found out... I'd lose my company. My reputation is my life. But if you were a man, it wouldn't change a thing? I won't say anything, don't worry. See you later. Gossip, gossip. Don't say anything, she's a friend. Of course not, business as usual. Here, I have the best gossip. Like what? I can't, guest confidentiality. If you knew... Just one! Here we are. I've never seen your new office. A manager! That's far from a sure thing. What do you mean? I got myself into trouble with the fertility treatments. Coming in late, calling out sick... And for what? Nothing. Now nobody trusts me, and today... Is a real shit show. Nothing's ever a sure thing, anyway. You've always been the girl who never gives up. Oh yeah? Not with everything. Yeah. I don't understand why we have to sacrifice some dreams to achieve others. Christmas is a giant magnifying glass showing us everything we don't have. Christmas shouldn't make us feel like a loser and question all our life choices! Fuck Christmas! - Fuck everything! Fuck everything! It's the hospital. - Take it. Hello? Hey, how are you? - I'm good, you? All good. Happy to see you. - Me too. I think we've gone over everything... Yes. We'll talk after the holidays. It's nice, isn't it? He's back in the game. I have something to tell you. Dad's cheating on you. Thanks. Your friend earlier... You told her I was just a client? Does she know anything? No. I don't want to ruin things, but... I have to ask the question I never dare to ask. I knew it was coming... I can't hide like this forever... It's no way to live. I know. I know it isn't fair. You're important to me. Do we have a future together? I love you, you know... But you love your wife, too. I do. I love you both for different reasons. My wife and son are my family. You're... With you, everything sparkles like young love. I laugh, I have fun far from my responsibilities. I don't want to lose them... But I don't want to lose you, either. My worlds can coexist. I'm telling you. I want more than that, Antoine. I understand. Hello. Hello! Everything went well. He's been transferred to a recovery room. Pavilion A, Room 50. Where's my husband? - Mom? My God! I'm with them! Room 50... - Where were you? Yeah, we were worried! How is he? Have you seen the doctor? What did he say? No, we... Thanks. All the way at the end? - Yes. Normand? Mom, don't wake him up. Where were you? Why didn't you return our calls? I tried, but I got stuck in a roadblock without a signal! Oh no! - That sucks. It's okay, it's all over now. Everyone's here now, that's the important thing! He'll be OK, don't worry. The two of you really gave us a scare! Just say it: we ruined your Christmas! Were you the ones stuck in a roadblock for hours? No! I didn't think so. I just meant I wasn't exactly expecting this, but that applies to everyone... It was a real roller coaster. But that's life. The roller coaster of life. That would make a great book title. It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Now's not the time to brainstorm a book title! It's not the time to fight either! I've been cooking for days, and you can't be bothered to come see us. Where'd that come from? I told you! What? We didn't say we didn't want to come, I just asked for one extra day! Well, I didn't cancel. No, you never cancel! All you say is, "I'm exhausted, but I'll come if you insist." What? Christmas is the 24 and 25, can't we stick to that? Sorry for disrupting your busy schedule! We wanted to spend time just the two of us, for our last Christmas, is that too much to ask? Enough with the "last Christmas," nobody's dying. We're having a fucking kid! You haven't asked much about the ultrasound. You don't care? Excuse me! You could have just told us how it went. You're so crabby! - I'm not crabby, I'm pregnant! You'll see, it really messes with you! I don't think I'll get a turn, I have such shitty taste in men! Not everybody can find Mr. Right and have a perfect life. We heard the sarcasm loud and clear. We should have just stayed home! I was looking forward to a night to myself too! I bought sugar-free, salt-free peanut butter, organic fair-trade cocoa, bread made with flour I've never heard of, aluminum-free baking powder, and a goddamn free range turkey! And if I'm being honest, I think it sucks for the turkey who had tons of fun to die instead of the one with the boring life. At least death would have been a deliverance! It never should have had such a great life. It died for nothing! Now it's just rotting in the back of my car! And now I learn that coming to see us is a chore?! I guess I'm the turkey! Mom, what's the deal? I don't get it, you brought your food here? You must know the trick for keeping cool in moments like this! My husband was dying and I'd spent days cooking for you! How did I know if I'd be gone a day, a week, a month, a year! We'd need to eat! Where were you planning to cook it? It's a girl and she's healthy, by the way. And, newsflash- our life is going to change! Good! I want to go on a cruise! My God! Normand. I had things to do today, but I came back for you. And now you don't want to listen! Fine, leave! But bundle up! If you can answer one simple question, I'll do what you say. Why do we bundle up everywhere but our face? What's so special about the face that it can be exposed without everyone getting on your case?! I don't know. Come sit down, OK? There's nothing you can tell me that I don't already know. Understand? You know about it? But, Mom... There's more than one way to live life. What's going on is between your father and I. I just wanted to... - I know you meant well. So what did you skip out of that was so important? I was an idiot. Sorry. I think you should go. I'm sorry I ruined your Christmas. You didn't ruin anything. You can't predict these things. We're just glad you're OK. Well, girls, it was nice of you to come. I know it wasn't easy! Mom, stop it. Mom, don't make us worry like that again, OK? If we had to spend Christmas without you, I don't think I'd ever get over it. That makes four of us. Now go on, enjoy your evening. No way, we're staying with you! That's why we came! We'll be fine, won't we? We'll see you tomorrow. My girls! I'm the one who's sick... Poor Normand! Thank you. I hope you're all having a wonderful evening. I'm Chloe Nadeau, Hotel Manager. As you know, each year thousands of people struggle to meet the basic needs of their family. Tonight I'm delighted to take the time together to offer them hope. But also some... Maggie?! Hello! Where were you? And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. One of the greatest singers of our time, he's toured the world singing classics and performing in musicals! Let's give a warm welcome to Antoine Blouin! The snowy trail In the valley Where there dances Bunch of saps. The frozen pine There lingered quietly Traces of a kiss On your face I'd given you Snowflakes Covered your hair And the beige moon Made us happy I wanted to surprise you by getting in earlier, but I'm stuck at the station. I'll catch the next one. I have to tell you, Mikaël knows. Yeah... It made me realize I'm no longer comfortable with our situation. I'd like to talk about it. You know I love you both. I know. I'm on my way. Ah, Maggie! Where was she? - I don't know. But it looks like she found her way. Oh yeah? That was the deal. What are you doing here? You know the meeting with the colleagues who wanted to bring me back? No. What about your family emergency? Everything's fine now. I have more time than I'd planned. And... when people start doing dance moves while they talk... It's my cue to leave. That's really not my thing. Oh, no? What? You don't like this? No... Feel like going outside? Yeah, sure, OK. But don't take this as a declaration of love. My sister was on the train, she overheard you saying I'd declared my love. I don't know where you got that, all I suggested was a date. You don't have to... freak out. You're right. It sucks to be misquoted. OK for...? The date. There's a café over there. Hang on, I've had a crush on you since I was 9, and our first date will be in a tourist trap with moose on the walls? You've had a crush all that time? Not the whole time... it comes in waves, it fluctuates. I think your sister missed the part when I asked my friend how to get out of the friendzone. Do you think now would be a good time to kiss? Now? I don't know, it's cold and I'm in tights... They're not made for winter. Plus my mouth is frozen, when I talk it goes wa-wa-wa... Is my nose running? So it's about appearances? I think now's the perfect time. So when are you heading back to London? I thought I might stay.
