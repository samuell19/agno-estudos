[MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTING] [RAY GUN ZAPPING] [LASERS SHOOTING] Quit trying. You know it's impossible. Only chance we've got is no chance at all. I know it can't be done. [CHAINS CREAKING] I'm just glad that you didn't know it! I hope you realize you did nothing to help the situation. Here, work on these. I'll be quiet as a mouse. It takes teamwork, Tisa. OK? Ready, go! [CHAINS CREAKING] I've got an idea, that if we can reverse the polarity on these cuffs, the only thing standing between us and freedom is stealing a starship. Oh, sure. Is that all? And to think I was worried there for a second. If we could short circuit the lock on the cell with a chain-- Yeah, but we're wearing the chains. A little shock never hurt anyone. Give me a boost step. Ready? 1, 2, 3! Just a few more inches. I almost got it. Go over a little bit. Got it! [SHRIEKS] TISA: Are you all right? A little well done, perhaps. Hey, we're out of here! You're late. What else is new? Did you see those two they threw in solitary today? Not yet. I'd give a year's pay for 10 minutes in there. Oh! [GRUNTING] Uh! Ow. Uh. Feels good to be back in the saddle again. I could say something rude, but I won't. What kind of range does this ship got? Beggars can't be choosers. Yeah, we could be choosing a course to oblivion. At least it's our choice. Well, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not run out of power between worlds, as they say. Well, look at this. Netaglide-- this isn't a shabby-ass derelict we're driving. We're cooking with atomic induction. OK, chef, let's take off before things get too hot. Keep your pants on, sister. I've got to unscramble the launch code first, and open the escape hatch. I'd love to punch a hole through the wall of this mothership if I could, but I'm not sure if we've got enough of a running start. We need a special glove to access this computer. - Try the glove compartment. - Oh, you're cute. Just give these magic fingers another second, and I'll have this puppy programmed. - You're brilliant. - Dazzling. People have to wear sunglasses. There. That should do the trick. [WHIRRING] Well, where's the ignition? Oh, don't start that again. Next thing you're going to want me to get out and jump start it. - What the hell is that? - Guess. We let a couple slaves escape, we're going to be busted. [ENGINE POWERING UP] Engine's hot. Defense drive engaged. We're on our way. Let's go. Check the scanners. Let's find out just how free we are. Anything nearby? It's kind of dark out there. Anything at all? Looks to me like we're cruising the town of nowhere. - This is only a lifeboat. - Yeah. We're not exactly equipped to go galaxy hopping. We picked a fine time to jump ship. [BEEPING] I'm picking up something, not far from here-- beacon. Out here? Let's check it out. TISA: It's coming from that small planetoid. You know, there's something odd about this. That signal isn't just a safe channel beacon. That beam's transmitting astro-navigational landing coordinates. We'd be lucky to find a rock out here big enough to set down on, and you're questioning an invitation to a habitable world with a landing strip? I'll lock the beam of the directional grid into the hyperdrive system. [RUMBLING] Something's wrong! TISA: Aren't we dipping the orbit a bit fast? Hit the brakes! Cut the tractor beam. Retros aren't firing. We're not slowing down! Disengage [INAUDIBLE]. It's locked in some kind of autopilot! Nothing's functioning. The beam is overriding our controls. Engines won't reverse. I can't pull it out! We're going down! We've got no choice. We're going to have to jump for it. Slim chance. Better than none. We'll ride this rocket as close as we can, then bail out and hope for the best. TISA: This is it, isn't it? You never know. There is an atmosphere down there. Yeah, but can we breathe it? We'll soon find out. This wasn't exactly the way I hoped things would turn out. [CRASH] [ROBOT MOVEMENT] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [JUNGLE NOISES] [RUMBLING] Is anybody here? is there anybody home? I'm not trying to break in. My ship crashed into the sea on the far side of the island. I'm afraid I'm the only survivor. Can you understand my language? Are you programmed to speak? ZED: He never talks to others, unless I instruct him to. However, he understood every word. Good evening. Good evening. Is this your house? Yes, it is. My name is Zed. I'm glad to meet you-- very glad. I was just telling him I was in a shipwreck. I know. You know? How? TISA: Daria! I thought I'd lost you! No such luck. I guess we're still stuck with each other. I was afraid you didn't make it. I know the feeling. How do you like my new outfit? Our host seems to be ready for anything. He didn't say a word about the way I was dressed. It must have occurred to him I was a shade shabby to own a starship. Well, I'm not exactly the height of fashion myself. Have you mentioned the off-beam landing coordinates? The opportunity hasn't exactly presented itself. I didn't want to start asking too many questions, because I didn't want to start answering any. Vak will show you to a guestroom. You must get out of those clothes at once. They look just about the way I feel. Vak will find you others. We're prepared for such emergencies. Dinner will be served shortly. My guests and I were about to dine when you arrived. We'll wait for you. Guests? Yes. There are survivors of another wreck staying here in the house. Another wreck? Unfortunately, the space lanes in this sector are extremely dangerous. But we can talk about that later. Don't wait for me. It'll take me a while to get myself cleaned up. And anyway, I'm still a little shook up from the crash. I understand. Perhaps you will join us later. Vak. [ROBOT MOVEMENT] - Is anything wrong? - No. No, nothing. Here are your clothes. Tell me, why are there bars on these windows? This was once an old fortress. It was built by space pirates, and eventually abandoned long ago. Now the bars keep the dangers of the jungle out. Have you searched the shore? Were there any others? [KNOCKING] - Come in. You look breathtaking. Fits you like a glove. Where did you get it? One of the many leftovers from the castle's previous tenants. Pirate plunder? Vak must have been telling you some of our local history? Not as much as I'd like to know. We finished dinner. Your friend, Tisa, has been asking about you. I'm a bit more refreshed now, thanks. I feel almost myself again. Then let's go down and join the others. What you need is some stimulation, some interesting company. I can promise you both. Daria, this is Shela, and her brother, Rik. I've heard a lot about you. Nothing good, I hope. SHELA: Tisa hasn't spoken of anything else. It sure took you long enough to make it down. You're worth waiting for. This is a pleasure-- two beautiful women arriving the same day. Until you girls turned up, I was beginning to get just a shade stir crazy-- 10 days of nothing but jungle and ocean. Rik is less than thrilled by my little island. Well, then why stay? It's not my idea. There's only one launch, and that's being worked on. Guess you'll have to be patient for a little while longer. Well, I wouldn't complain if I were you. I feel like I'm living on borrowed time right now. I'm just glad to be here. All the comforts of home in the most remote corner of the galaxy. Too remote. Of course, it's perfect for you, Zed. You can go hunting if you want. Hunting? Here? He sleeps all day and hunts all night. Bet he has you doing the same thing. This obsession with hunting you call sport, isn't it just a little inconsistent? A beast in the jungle killing merely for his existence is called savage. The man killing just for sport is called civilized. Isn't that a bit contradictory? What makes you think it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man? Take that fellow right there, for instance. There was never a time when he couldn't have gotten away. But he didn't want to. He got interested in hunting me. He didn't hate me for stalking him any more than I hated him for trying to charge me. Matter of fact, we admired each other. Perhaps. But would you change places with him? Not now. Don't evade the issue. Would there be as much sport in the game if you were the prey, instead of the hunter? That is something I will never have to decide. This universe is divided into two types of people-- the hunter and the hunted. You want to go hunting? Let's go. We'll have a big party, get totally blitzed, and spray laser bolts-- [LAUGHING] --all over the jungle. Completely civilized point of view. SHELA: Civilized? Yes. Rik talks of stimulants as a prelude to the hunt. Cocktails before breakfast? We barbarians know that it is only after the chase that man indulges. You know the saying of the Alteric chieftains? Hunt first the enemy, then the woman. That's the savage's idea everywhere. It's the natural instinct. Blood rushes from the kill. One passion builds, then another kill, then love. And when you know that, then you know ecstasy. Forgive me. When I start talking about hunting, I become oblivious to everything, even beautiful women. Will you play for us? Zed's quite accomplished on this rather unique instrument of his. It's a holographic [INAUDIBLE].. It simply transforms touch into patterns of light and sound, and I'm really not all that accomplished at it. SHELA: He's fantastic. You should see what he can make it do. Well, if you're sure that you can stand it. I could use some air. Would you be gracious enough to accompany me? Our host certainly is an unusual character. RIK: Frightening is a better word. Don't trust him. What makes you say that? I'm not as loaded as I seem. There's something sinister going on in this place. We're all prisoners here. There's nothing wrong with his spacecraft. He lied about it needing repairs. The android makes a rendezvous with the supply ship at regular intervals. Well, perhaps he enjoys your company. There were four of us a week ago. The others have disappeared. One night after dinner, he took our pilot into the trophy room. The locked door? Yes. Last night he took our navigator. We haven't seen him since. Have you asked him about them? He says they've gone hunting. How many androids are there? Two. Vak over there looks after the house. Krel patrols the beaches and the jungle. We're watched every moment, night and day. Be careful. He's looking at us. SHELA: Won't you play some more? You must be tired. After all, it is midnight. It's time for all of you to turn in. Vak. Every night, he packs us off to bed, like bad, little children. ZED: Aw, my dear-- charming children. It's been a fascinating evening. Who wants to go to bed? You promised to show me the trophy room. Yes, I did, but not now-- later. Good night. It's been a pleasure being rescued by you. Good night. Good night. [LASER SHOOTING] [LASER SHOOTING] [MAN YELLING] I was afraid to make a noise. Why? My sister's not in her room. Is that so bad? It is in this place. I'm worried. I mean, Zed's planning something, something involving Shela and me. You got pretty loaded tonight. Maybe you're just exaggerating all this in your mind. I was only pretending to be high. Why? Because if I stay sober, I'm likely to be Zed's next victim. Where do you think she's gone? Where do the others go? That door downstairs. You scared me half out of my wits. What are you doing down here? Somebody had to find out what's in this place. After Zed and his boys left, I searched his room and found this duplicate key. Did you see what's on those walls? Yeah. That's what he's planning for all of us. Where does that corridor lead to? He's got an escape launch stashed back there. That's our ticket out of here. Not without Shela. Yeah, but where is she? - And down there? - I don't know. I haven't had a chance to look. There must be some way out of here. We'll find out. [ROBOT GEARS WHIRRING] Shela's still gone. What was in that sack they were carrying? We may as well face the fact we're dealing with a maniac. We've only one chance with a man like that. We've got to get the jump on him. Where does he keep his laser guns? You heard what he said about hunting with bow and arrow. If he has any laser rifles, he must keep them locked up here somewhere. At least we know where he keeps his ship. Yes, but you can't get to the launch pad from outside. I've tried. There are no bars here. I wonder why. It was Zed's room. He gave it to Shela. Generous of him, but lucky for us. - We have to find her. - We will. I'm going to search the castle. You'll only get caught and tip Zed off we're onto him. We've still got several hours before dawn, and we have to use them to advantage. Have you got a knife? Only this. It'll have to do. While Zed is occupied here, you and I will set traps in the jungle. If he leaves to go hunting again tonight, signal us if you can, and try to find Shela. Zed thinks he has us cornered. But he may find out how it feels to be trapped himself. With him out of the way, the androids might not be too hard to handle. What if they check our rooms? It's a chance we'll have to take. Wish us luck. We'll need it. Hurry back. If you two get yourselves killed out there, you'll have me to answer to. [JUNGLE SOUNDS] [YELLING] Take your hands off me. If you don't let me go, my brother will kill you. I only hope that this will fan the flames of his hate-- might inspire him to action. Otherwise, I fear that he's going to provide little or no challenge. [SMACK] That's good. This will be fun. Do you think the snare will hold? [SNAPPING] Listen. Did you hear that? Yeah. If Zed or his droids stumble across this trap now, we're sunk. He's coming this way. [SNAPPING] [GROWLING] What was that? It wasn't Zed. That thing looked like some kind of mutant. Something tells me there's more in this jungle than meets the eye. Did you notice that fallen tree back there on the path? Hard to miss. We walked under it. If we cut away the supporting branches or rig a trip vine, it would make a perfect deadfall. Hope we've got enough time left before dawn. Let's find out. [ROBOT MOVEMENT] [WHIMPERING] It would have taken half as long with a decent knife. How sensitive is this trip wire? The slightest touch on that vine and the mahogany log comes crashing down, crushing anything beneath it. Then our whole bet rides on Zed being the next living creature down this path. Just another chance we've got no choice but to take. You know, you aren't the only one under the impression that Zed was the sole inhabitant of this planet. The last few hours tell a different story. I wonder what else is walking, crawling, or slithering around out there. Time will tell. This is all we can do for now. Let's head back. Krel, I'm afraid we need to keep Shela under restraint. If she awakens, she is likely to alarm our other visitors, unless we keep her comfortable here. The sun is up already. We've still got a ways to go yet. This is taking longer than I thought. It didn't seem this far last night, even in the dark. It won't be long before we're missed. Come on. Vak, check the upstairs rooms. Make sure all of our guests are safely in their beds. What a delicious day it is. It's just perfect for a morning swim. Won't you come with me? Zed says the jungle is just full of danger. I'd feel a whole lot safer with a big, strong android like you along to protect me. Of course, I haven't got a swimsuit. But I'm sure you won't mind. I need to check the guest rooms upstairs. Why bother? Everyone's still asleep. I'm the only one who's bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning. Come on. Let's go. I have my orders. Well, if you're not coming now, I'm going alone. Krel, it's time to patrol the beaches again. Send word to me if you spot anything unusual or I might be interested in, but only if it's worth waking me for. Are you sure this is the right trail? I'm not sure about anything anymore. Just about here. Now, you just wait right here while I go take a dip. What are you doing here? Watching her. The master ordered you to check the upstairs rooms. Everything at the house is in order. Did you see for yourself? Well, uh, no. I think you should be guarding the house. You think? You've never thought for your entire existence. You are insulting. You are correct. How are we going to sneak past them? They're right below us. Let's hope I can get Tisa's attention before the chrome domes spot us. (WHISPERING) Tisa! Tisa! Tisa! You should return to the house. I don't take orders from you. Vak, is anything wrong? I hope I haven't caused any trouble. No. No problem. Could you bring me my towel? The master will not be pleased with your absence. You displease me, and I ignore you. Vak, never mind the towel. I'm going to stay in a little longer. I'm going to inform the master. Tattletale! Take off your shirt. Go, go, go! This has to be convincing. I'm convinced. [MOANING] [CRASH] Aw. Oh. Uh. Man and woman-- a great concept. I love it. I never knew how much I missed making love until just now. I've been through a lot lately, to say the least. You made me feel alive again. I know what I want. I know what it is I'm fighting for. Thanks. You don't have to thank me. It was my pleasure. If I die today, I wouldn't complain. Right now, this moment, I have to be the happiest guy in the universe. [THUD] No doubt you've been wondering about your sister. She's my prisoner. Here's your chance. Timer on the gun won't activate for 10 minutes. I'm allowing you that much head start. If you can elude me until dawn, or kill me, then you've won your freedom, and hers. You'll regret this. Not a particularly original response, but I am sure that it is a sincere expression of your feelings. I suggest you hurry. Your time is running out. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Aw. [LASER BEAM SHOOTING] [LASER BEAM SHOOTING] [GROANING] [GEARS GRINDING] The drug will wear off quickly. I wouldn't want to compromise your alertness in any way. That would defeat my entire purpose. [GASPS] You're an inhuman fiend. There was no need to show that to her. We all have different needs-- some of us, very different. Experiences which stimulate me, singularly specific-- I have my own special philosophy, consistent with my unique lifestyle. I've always felt that the best of life lies closest to death. Living on the edge-- that's where you find the thrill of life. I couldn't agree with you less. The best of life lies as far from death as possible. In the end, no one wins the game of life. Yes. But I prefer to lose as slowly as I can. You'll have your chance to pit your philosophy against mine-- a contest of skills played on the chess board of my private planet. I intend to hunt you. You can't be serious. You're not going to hunt women, are you? I've always found the female of the species to be the greatest challenge, far more crafty and cunning than their male counterparts. They're devious, unpredictable, full of surprises-- wonderful surprises. I'll do my best to keep you guessing. I'm going to release the three of you simultaneously. I'm going to give you hunting knives and an hour head start. There's a temple on the far side of my island containing high-powered laser weapons. If you can make it that far, those weapons will give you more than a fighting chance. Here is a map with directions to the temple. Any last plea for compassion? You can't do this. Life is too precious to be killed for sport. It's a cold cosmos. Here are your claws and fangs. I expect the three of you to provide me with an unusual challenge. We'll try to live up to your expectations. I'm going to limit myself to my favorite light weapons-- pistol crossbows. Generous of you to handicap yourself so severely. ZED: I want to give you every opportunity to beat me. Even that stimulates my competitive instincts. I am going to enjoy this. Not if I can help it. I suggest we waste no more time. A good head start is everything. One word of advice-- try not to get lost in the phantom zone. SHELA: I want to bury this knife in his heart. I'm going to wait for Zed right here and ambush him. He'd never expect it. You'd never know what hit you. Our only hope is to stick together. Alone, he'll only pick us off one at a time. The three of us outnumber him. The trap lies just ahead. This trap isn't going to do us any good. At least we won't be running into him on the trail. Yeah, but his mate might not be too happy about this. Let me take a look at that map. This should be the way. You need this more than I do. Just touch that hidden trip vine, and you have 10 tons of tree in your lap. That's one headache I'd rather avoid. - Watch your step! - I'll tiptoe. It seems as though we've come miles. An hour doesn't take you far in jungle this dense. Zed should be starting out about now. He'll be coming fast. Let me check the map and get our bearings. It's not here. It must have fallen out somewhere along the path. It's no wonder it slipped through. I should have held onto it myself. - Let's go back together. - No. I lost it. I'll find it. Stick to the path. I'll catch up with you. Watch out for the deadfall. It would be just like her to get herself crushed. I'm tired. I'm sick of this. I don't want to have to fight for my life. Consider the alternative. Those heads in Zed's trophy room didn't look too happy to me. I am tired of being so scared. I'm sorry about Rik. I know sorry doesn't change anything, but I want you to know how I feel, just the same. Thanks. Suddenly, simple human warmth means a lot. I never knew I needed friends so much before all this happened. [CRASH] Well, we've scouted far enough ahead to see what this trail has to offer. What do you say we go back and wait for Tisa by the chasm? Meet her halfway? I don't want Zed catching up with her without us there to back her up. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] If Zed spots Tisa, she won't stand a chance. We've got to flush him out. But how? There's only one way. [GASPS] [GROANS] [ARROWS FLYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] She deserved better than this. She sacrificed herself for me. Fate certainly weaves a twisted tapestry. If only the slavers had passed us by. If, if-- I'm sick of ifs. If life wasn't so cruel, everything would be beautiful. Life doesn't care. Look at this jungle. Everything in it survives by killing something else-- not by choice, just by circumstance. Zed kills by choice. So will I. Do we go back and finish Zed off? With these? That spike may slow him down, but it won't stop him. He's too hot with those little crossbows to suit me. And we make such attractive targets. I'm itching to get my hands on some serious weapons. Is there any guarantee this temple even exists? Well, what have we got to lose? Don't answer that. Did you ever dream life would turn out like this? Never in a million years. A million years. I'll be thankful if we survive until dawn. This must be the keystone, but nothing's happening. What if this mechanism no longer operates? From life to death is the reach of man. If this panel represents death, then my guess is the adjacent panel represents life. Now, Tisa, when I say go, we push both panels at the same time, OK? Go! This must be the phantom zone Zed warned us about. Considerate of him not to mention it surrounds the weapons. I have the strangest feeling the normal laws of time and space no longer apply. If we get separated-- Tisa? [ECHOING] Tisa? [ECHOING] Tisa? Tisa? [GURGLING] [GRUNTING] [GURGLING] [GROWLING] Tisa? [HEAVY BREATHING] [LASER BEAM SHOOTING] Are you all right? I've had nightmares that weren't as scary as this. Don't touch it. That's how I activated him in the first place. He's ventilated with laser holes. He is history now. History has a way of repeating itself. Oh yeah? Here are some things which will help us change the course of the future. Help yourself. [GUN COCKING] We've still got to find a way out of here before any more screaming demons come flying through the fog. We can't see a thing. Which means we'll have to use our other senses-- supersonic psycussion. What about it? That's the answer. This emits deadly sonic shock waves. If I fire in a 360-degree pattern-- The shot that doesn't echo back will be the direction of the opening to the outside. Exactly. [LASER POWERING UP] Let's do it! [LASER BEAMS SHOOTING] [GRUNTING] Do you think we have a chance? I know we do. Have to find her. Have to find her. Where? [LASERS SHOOTING] [SCREAMS] Death is always incredible-- always for others, never for ourselves. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING AND SHRIEKING] [INAUDIBLE] [LASER BEAM SHOOTING] [CRASH] [GRUNTING] Where's the ignition on this one? It's voice activated. That shouldn't be any problem for you. [GROANING] Phantom drive is engaged. [BEEPING] Engine's hot. Let's go! [JET ENGINE TAKING OFF] Right rudder, left rudder. Descend 20 degrees. [BEEPING] Slow down. We're going to hit that thing. Pull up! Pull up! Who taught you how to drive? Get us out of here, fast! Did we have to steal such an expensive ship? Do you know how much time these things spend in the shop? [THUNDER CLAP] That was close. Now what do we do? Our universe is vast, full of wonders. We'll explore, find strange, new worlds, together. [MUSIC PLAYING]
