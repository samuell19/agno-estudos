He's not actually very different from anyone else. As a matter offact, he reminds me of my Uncle Farkash who lived in Morocco. He was always sending home for more money. Has Pierre been asking you for more money? Yes. - And you? - Mm-hmm. And you? - A little. - Often. What does he do with it? God knows. Very interesting soup. - What is it, cabbage? - Mmm.

She considered it another form ofself-expression. George, you've inherited her taste and her culture. Oh. And her money. Are you sure... you're using it the way she would have wanted you to? Well, Mother would have wanted me to support the best things today. Pierre... and the Manhattan Encounter Theater Laboratory? I suppose Mother wouldn't have understood, but, uh...

We used to find o/o' clothes in herattic and dress up and act, you kno w? One ofus would bang around on the piano... and the other would orate. We both were very good at passionate speeches. When she turned 18, we got on a bus and came to New York City. Took us four days to get here. And when we final/y arrived we got married She's so intense. She's very ardent. And the way she is about this now she used to be about me. I don't understand what she's doing. I - How valuable is this? La, Lady L. You are so afraid I shall not take care of her. She always encouraged me t0 do s0 much more than /'m doing And I actually thought we had something to contribute... to the theater together. Whatevershe does, it'; 700 % I mean, she doesn't hold back on anything. And I keep thinking how she used to be that way with me. At least I've stopped hoping that that will ever be again. But I have to see her. Listen, it was nice to meet you. Thanks. Good luck. Yo, Victor. Let me give you a ride. This is my cab. Yeah, I drive a cab. - Okay. - Because, listen, I gotta talk to you. It's about something important. It's important to me anyway. - Where are you going? - /'m taking him uptown. In the middle of rehearsal? Listemjenny, I need to talk to him. I need a break. - / want t0 work. - But you are working. - You're the clergyman. You're Mr. Foot. - Oh, thanks. Thanks very much. Listen to this. Pierre wants me to play this clergyman as a i 0-year-old. - A 10-year-old clergyman. It's great. - Listen, we gotta go back in. I'm not going back in there! He's waiting for us. We're in the middle of rehearsal. What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? My God! I -l should be auditioning. Calling an agent. Ofcourse, the minute they hearyou're with Pierre's group... they get all freaked out. I get freaked out myself. I don't know ifl'm any good anymore. Pierre says we're all stuck in cliches. And that only he can release. S 0, i t 's like being reborn. Regenerated. - Do you believe that? - N0. I don't believe I should be driving a cab... and living the wayl do with nothing. - Why do you stay with him? - D0n 't you think lask myself that question? Why-Why do I staywith him? What am I learning? “Change your character,“ he says. He says, “Change your soul.“ I haven't changed. I'm not a better person. Well, sometimes you 've got t0 become worse in order t0 become better. Listen. I'm finished with him. I'm through. WelLJamie... just take me back. Okay. Um - Uh, you know why he limps, don't you? It's his split hoof. {Laughing} - Whose? Pierre 'sl Did you hear that one? You shouldn't talk about him like that. Have fun. No, thanks. What am I gonna do? [am/e, there is someone whoH/ike to work with you. You know, Lillianna is trying to do her own production of Sir Char/es Grandson. She's gonna take it away from Pierre? [enn y won 't lea ve him. She is crazy. They all are. He has that effect on people. You know something? I think I'm crazy too. You decide. Okay, you know where I'm staying? Where? Michael's loft. - And the number? - 431-5825. Let goJenny- Let go. Utter rubbish and nonsense. You know he's right. One has to have vision. You've got lots ofvision. George, you bought the manuscript. And haven't we talked about all the wonderful things we're gonna do with it? Yes, but when I'm with him, I believe everything he says. And I want to do what he says. I'm convinced that he's right. And then afterwards it's like you say... utter rubbish and nonsense. When I was small... Mother and I used to go to a seaside place in Belgium. Mother felt very comfortable there. She would read her book, and I would play in the sand. And one year, there was a bigger boy. And he asked to help me with my sand castle. And he built itwith me. And I liked ita lot. It was much better than anything I ever made. And then he did a very funny thing. He- Hejumped all over the sand castle... we had spent so much time and trouble building. He- Hejumped on it with two feet... and trampled it down. And when I cried, he laughed. And what did your mother say? Oh, she was deep into her book. She was reading Henryjames that year. And then the next day, he came again. And you know what happened? I let him playwith my sand castle again. And then he did the exact same thing. The exact same thing happened. And then he came every day. And every day I waited for him. And every dayl waited for him tojump on it. And every day he did. And every dayl cried. And then one day, Mother noticed. And she said, “What's the matter?“ And he said, “Why don't you tell her?“ Butl didn't. Ijust said, “We're playing, Mother.“ And she - she went back to The Golden Bowl Oh, no, Lillianna. I'm getting much too fat. 0h, all right. You should've told your mother about that boy. - She'd have helped you. - l know. - Will you promise me something? - Ofcourse, Lillianna. Tell me, what is it? What? That you'll let me helpyou fight those bigger boys. When theyjump all over my sand castles? Or whatever wicked thing they do.

Don't wait down here in the cold. Pierre will use you... and he'll be finished with you. That's what it all comes to. The experiments, the encounters, the laboratories. When he's tired ofit all, he'll take off. Lillianna, what a surprise! To what do we owe the pleasure ofthis visit? My, oh, my. You look wonderful. Radiant. Younger and even more beautiful than I remember. Mmm. You've come to take little Ariadne away, haven't you? Hmm. You're right. This is not a place for her, no. You don't interfere. You don't come between them. I'm telling her to go. - Ifyou try to keep them apart - - I'll even help her pack. Gregory- Come with me. - Don't you want to? - I can't. Why? My hair's wet. It's not personal. Ifthat's what I was interested in, why should I have left? I wouldn't ever- I mean, that way. What do you mean, “She took offwith Victor“? Why would she do that? Where did they go? Didn 't she lea ve a telephone number or an address or anything? Well, she must have said something. She must have. Listen. Fritz, please tell me. She wouldn't leave without saying anything. Come on! Why don't you tell me? Come 0n, damn it! Don't play so damn dumb, Billy. You stupid creep! They're all the same. just like my mother. - Where is she? - Dead. The whole dramatic first part.

Got it. Pierre says keep it. He says you andjamie will need it. Pierre 5a ys you should g0 too. I'm not interested in working with Lillianna. I tried t0 g0 away once... 'cause I was sick ofeverything. Cooking in the restaurant. New York, all that. So I joined this other company and we went to L.A. “La-la.“ Yeah, they were doing the Oresteia. And they paid me. And I couldn't stand it. Sol came back. I mean, to Pierre. I thought we weren't supposed to have personal attachments. Here. Keepit You've gotta get away from him. You gotta get away from there. Jamie, I'm working. I'm totallyinvolved. Who you with, him or me? Listen, baby, I don't want my girl in bed with me thinking about Pierre all the time. I'm not thinking about Pierre. Really. Yeah, but he wants you to. And I don't blame him. No, I don't. But he's gotta have a person all the time... all ofthe person. And I'm not gonna give him me. And I'm not gonna give him you.

I can see it in your face, here and there. It was you who made her go back to Victor. It was you. It was you. You have a strong head. And a heart... that's much too passionate, Katya. Ifyou don't look out... you'll be in bad trouble. You'll lose everything. You'll drown. What month were you born in? You don't need to tell me. I know it's the same as mine. It couldn't be anything else. Same sign... same heart, Katya. We belong together. Mm-mmm. You'll see. I can't pretend that I wasn't like you... once upon a time. Just the same, Katya. Sol know all about it, unfortunately. That's the one thing Pierre taught me: never to care too much for one single person.

It is reached in Victor Charlton's performance in Here WeAreAga/n. ” That's wonderful, Victor. - But why frivolity? - It goes on. “It is not generally realized that on the stage, the more frothy the surface... “the more solid the foundation... “that unless they are supported on iron girders... our butterflies' wings will break.“ Wonderful It'; immortal prose. What does it mean? I have a flair for dramatic structure... butl have difficulty with the dialogue. You can always get some writer to fix it up foryou. He came 290m San Francisco with his who/e fiami/y Sister, brother-in-law, and all ofthem. Bigjewish family. - It folded after two nights. - l loved it. The thing is, they fix up their dressing room for pictures. Mai/grams and things. Then they ha ve t0 take them all down. Hi, how are you? Ariadne. Katya's outside. Well, how doyou like working with Lillianna? - It's great. - Wonderful. Great. I have to askyou both a favor. Really, a great favor. The committee wanted to see my play to decide about the grant. And l'mjust gonna have to have both ofyou. I can't start with new actors now. You'll have to come. What about Lillianna? Ah, yes. Lillianna. - What a shame. - She used to give quite good parties too. - Excuse me. - Ah, Pierre. - George, how are you? - How's our project coming? We can't say no, jamie. Not to him. Why frivolity? Would somebody explain that to me? Isn't he cute? No, but seriously... The thing about it that I didn't understand... was the complete lack ofiogic that was in the damn thing from beginning to end. All set? You go ahead. I'll be there. - I'll come later. - Ariadne. I promise. Go ahead. Go on. Don't torment me, Boris. I'm just an ordinary woman. Am I really so old and ugly... that you don't mind speaking to me about other women? I musfve gone mad, but you... you're the last page of my life... myjoy. my happiness. If you lea ve me, even for an hour, / shal/go out of m y mind My beautiful, wonderful man. My master. - Someone might come in. - Let them. I'm not ash - Billy, where'd you get that? - Did you steal it? - Damn you, Bil/y! Lunatic! Get out of my house. L unatic/ Get out! Come on, Billy. Come on. Come on now. You're not hurt. A// nght? L ook, nobody'; gonna hurt you. The work means nothing to you? After everything we've done together? You're not serious. Get out, both ofyou! Get out of here. Come on, Billy. All right, get out. Good. Suits me fine. I've had enough of both ofyou. Just leave me alone. The mistakel made was to thinkyou cared about all this. You never did. Yes, I did... once, a lot. I guess I sort ofgrew out ofit. I'd like you to come to my dress rehearsal. You're planning a dress rehearsal? You sure you'll have all your actors? You know, I get the feeling... that George and the committee would really like us to collaborate on thejane Austen. You and I can't work together. We could. Why not, ifyou were willing? That's finished. - Good night. - Good night. Let's go. Go ahead. Go around again. Five minutes. Why don't you come back? Stand up. Come here. Being with Victor has changed you. All the work we did together. It's all gone. Can't I talk to her for five minutes alone? Yeah, sure. No. We all used to be together. It - It was perfect. All right. Supposing you do come back. That means no more - no more first nights. No more Lillianna. No more Victor... anything- As a matter offact, no more Ariadne. It'sjust one big negative, you see. That's all. That's all I have to offer. Why don't you take her back home? Where is she? Oh, Mrs. Awberry. Doyou thinkl could marrya man whom I always disliked and now hate? Is not this your house? Cannot you favor my escape? Oh, my dear madam. That is impossible without detection. And you kno w Sir Hargra ves is here... and there... and everywhere. My dear Mrs. Awberry.

Let me go out too. No, no, no! No, no, no! It's my sand castle all over again being stepped on. Bring some water directly. - Sol hope you have killed me at last. - Oh. I think we'll have to review our entire policy. How can wejustify our position? Well, we must respect his originality. Yes, but the manuscript, the manuscript. What about respect for the manuscript? No, I thankyou. I want nothing that can give me life. Well, then, Mrs. Awberry. You had better get out the black cloak, then. It's 4:00. And she ma y as well zfie in my house as in yours.
