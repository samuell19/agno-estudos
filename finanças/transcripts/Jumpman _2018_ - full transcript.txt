Anna! Another one arrived. - Long ago? - Just now. Move it! - I hope it's a boy. - Oh yeah. - I think it will be a girl again. - A boy would be cool. - Two girls arrived last week. - I wish he could stay with us. - Are you sure? - A boy would stay with us here. I hope it's a boy. - Hi there. - Yuck, what a shrimp! You are a shrimp. - How is he? - He is looking at us. - Hi, sweetie. You are so nice. - He is sucking his thumb. Cutie. - So nice. - We'll never abandon you. - A boy? - Is it a boy? We've got a boy. - Let's call him Lyosha. - It's going to be okay now. - What if he throws up now? - Watch your tongue. - Try sticking a finger in your mouth. - It's going to be okay now. We're gonna bathe you now. Do you like me? You like me? Are you ready, Den? - We are good to go. Come on. - Take off your clothes. - Let's do it, Den. - Don't forget to take off the uniform. - You hold the door. - I know. Are you ready? Go a little lower. Tighten it up. Around his arms.

Why didn't you say that it was you? Den, it was the best one for you! One minute 25 seconds. - You are a loser. - Go wash your face. Den, you are no loser. You'll perform better next time. Oksana Vladimirovna, I see perfectly well that your family situation is far from being perfect. Your life is a mess, and it makes me very uneasy. What do you mean? I have an apartment with a separate bedroom for Denis. I have been financially independent for a long time now. Your family is incomplete. You are not married. Why does that matter? Last time you wrote that you had a partner. But now you say that you are single again. I didn't write anything about a partner. I mentioned that I had a boyfriend. Yes? Vladimir Sergeevich, here is Denis Polyanskiy. Come in, Denis. Hello! Sweetie... Sit down. Okay. I feel very sympathetic towards you. You are his mother. But your parental rights were terminated. You left him in a baby box. Congenital analgesia is a serious condition. It requires continuous medical supervision. But you are not a doctor. - I am his legal guardian. - Exactly. This is why our institution doesn't find the reasons you mentioned sufficient enough for granting Denis unscheduled vacations. We reserved particular time slots throughout the year which you missed. Please. Just for a couple of days. It is going to be all right. I looked forward to this occasion. It's just that... I had some reasons... She had some reasons for not coming earlier. I promise you that nothing will happen. - I will be very cautious. Really. - Denis. You have to stay under doctor's supervision. You receive a complex medical treatment. Denis! Do you mean to say that I can't take him away today? No, you can't. - Keep going without turning back. - Okay. Pretend that nothing special is happening. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. I am good, thank you. - Who is she? - She is our speech therapist. There's a guard by the exit. Let's use the back door. If anyone asks, I can say that... Oops, Anna is coming this way. No sudden moves, please. She is going up to her office on the first floor. Let's go this way. - Will she look for us? - I don't think so. Move it, boys. - She is up on the first floor now. - Come on, come on. I'll say that I am taking you to your car. Better not say anything. - Did you bring any clothes? - Sure. The bag is in the trunk. Thank you. Come up here. Shit. Give me your hand. Come on. - Are you holding my hand, Den? - Yes. Come on. Let's go. - Did you pack up my things? - It's all here. Cool, bro. See ya. Let's go. Are you kidding me? Try to be more gentle. Come on, sweetie. Here you are. It's so easy. Let's get out of here. - Can I change my clothes now? - Yes. - Den, can you change in the car? - It's okay. The new clothes will get dirty. - Tell me. Is it the one you wanted? - Oh yes. - What is it? - It is a hose mark. - Why hose? - It's a game. They coil a hose around your body. And you try to breathe normally, stay in control and stand the pain. - What's the idea? - You have to stand the pain. What a stupid game! Come on. Please, put it on. Easy, easy. Come on. Wait a second. Here you are. Wait. Okay. - You like it? - Yes. - Did you also want a baseball cap? - Really? No kidding? It's yours. Walk a bit. Come on. Come back here! Come on. - Okay, now just walk. - What is it? - Can you just walk? - Like this? Okay. No, Den, can you just walk? - Can you take a picture of me? - Sure. Okay. - No, let's take a pic of us together. - Wait, wait. - Together? Let me do it. - Okay. - Our first picture together. - You have to move the camera back. And smile. - What an asshole! - No big deal. Thank you! I thought you would come earlier to take me back home. I could not come earlier, Den. Why? Look, there are situations where you can't do a thing. I didn't have enough money. I could not find any work. My friends helped me out. Otherwise I would have gone west. May I... May I solve the problems for you now? How would you do that? I... As soon as they arise, I will do away with them. You are my man. - Oksana, can you ride me in a cart? - Sure thing. - Watch out. - Easy. - Have you ever tried these? - No. They are so delicious. Chocolate-covered fruit jelly. Chocolate-covered fruit jelly? Oksana, what are you doing? Do you think that's enough, Oksana? - The shop assistant will see us. - These cookies are fantastic! Hey there, guys! - I am going to call the security! - Let's get out of here! - I told you. - Come on, move it. - Sweetie. Come on in. - I am coming in. - Where should I put the bags? - Put them down there. Welcome home. Take off the sneakers. Come in. I am coming in. - What a cool apartment! - It is. Beautiful. Do you rent this place? Or do you own it? My ex bought it for me. What a cool ex! He is probably a rich man. - You are too young to say so. - I am not young. Come here. Have you ever had your private room? Close your eyes and follow me. - I can't see a thing. - You don't have to see anything. - Don't peek, please. - Now you have to say... - And here comes the surprise! - And here comes the surprise! - This is your room. - Holy shit! - Really? - Really. This is my room! Oh yes! Please, don't lie on the bed in the dirty clothes. - The bed is so soft! - Please take your clothes off first! - These are your outdoor clothes! - Right... Now I will have to make the bed again. Denis! Let's agree not to wear outdoor clothes at home. - It's not that cold in here. - Okay. Deal? Oh yeah. Denis. Come on, make a wish. This is my third attempt. I can't do it one more time. Here we go! - Come on, make a wish! Do it! - Wait, wait, Oksana. You piggy-wiggy. Come on, do it! - Stop it. Let me think. - One, two... - You are distracting me. - Come on. One, two, three! - Please, come on! - Oksana! Please, do it a little faster. Hurray! What was your wish? - I won't tell you. - It will never come true if you don't. - It's a secret. I can't tell you. - Tell me anyway. If I tell you, it won't come true either. Make a toast. Okay, I want... I want to drink to us. This is a good one. Let's drink to us. This dinner is more like a birthday party. The cake is so good. Today we catch up on all your birthdays that we didn't celebrate together. Let it be the one you missed. - Me? - You. Yes, you did. I never missed your birthdays. Which was that? When I was 14, you never called me. I did. You couldn't come to talk. - No, you missed it. - You couldn't talk... You smeared me... Hello. Yes. My name is Denis. Oksana gave me your number. I am almost there. Right. Is it okay that there are so many people here? Got it. Okay. Sorry, can you give me the license plate again? A black car. Got it. Thank you. Sure. See you. What's the address of this place? Guys, will you call an ambulance? Guys, let's call an ambulance. What's the address? What are you looking at? Back off! - When did it happen? - 23:50. - When did we arrive? - 00:10. - Let's write 00:20. - Okay, 00:20. Give me an oxygen supply mask. The cart is getting rusty again. Make way! - Hi, Alyona. - Hi. Can you admit him? Bad injuries. What the hell is wrong with this cart? Hello, Tatyana Ivanovna. Will you lock the wheels? I don't want the dude to roll away. Okay. I am starving. What about sausages and peas? Okay. Are you Polyanskiy? Stand up and follow me. - What should I do with this thing? - Leave it there. Don't try to squeeze it. That will leave a bruise. - Let's go. - I am all bruised anyway. Hey there. What are you doing in my chair? Hello, bad boy! Watch out. My hand is smeared with blood. - How are you? Alive and kicking? - Yeah. How did it go? Are you kidding me? It was super! - You are the best. Give it to me. - Really? I never expected that from a rookie. Go wash yourself. - It was good, wasn't it? - You did an awesome job. Go wash yourself. We've got soap, bandages, and disinfectant there. Just imagine. When I arrived, he was on the ground with 20-30 people around. - How many people were there? - A lot. A fricking crowd. I could hardly make through. Everybody was yelling, some broads were shrieking. They were calling an ambulance. The dude looked totally dead. That was a horror movie. He started to shake. Really, mom. - I nearly shitted my pants. - Pasha! I thought we would go to jail. Should I write 'grievous bodily harm'? A fracture, a concussion. Just like usual. - A concussion... The whole thing. - The whole thing. I also need his hospitalization certificate. - The report from the ambulance team. - No way. - I will keep the original. - Mom... I told you a thousand times. If you want a report, here it is. Make a copy. Which one is the original one? I leave you this one and take a copy. Okay, kisses. I'll be waiting for you in the car. Would hospitalization mean that I'll have to stay in the hospital? No. If the vic denies everything in the courtroom, this certificate will help. - Your date of birth? - December 18, 2001. Turn on the hazards. Did you bring it? Attaboy. We cease the criminal proceedings. You study the traffic rules, vic. Denis! Come count the money! Pasha, why tell the entire neighborhood? Are you nuts? Keep it cool and hop in the car! Well? Catch! 20, 25, 30, 35, - 40, 45, 50... - Stop! - Count from zero. - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, - 65, 70, 75... - Keep counting. 80, 85, 90, 95, 100. 105, 110... The entire team is here. - Do you know where you are? - I guess so. And you are one of us now. - I'll introduce you to everyone. - Cool. These are the best people of the city. Can you see a young man wearing a bow tie? Alexander is a prosecutor. You see a blonde? I do. She is his girlfriend. A defense lawyer. Are you kidding? A defense lawyer and a prosecutor? - What's wrong about that? - It's weird. Why weird? You are a weirdo. - Ladies, look who is here. - Good job! - Olga. - Sweetie. - You are beautiful as ever. - Congratulations! Hello. - Perfect. - Thank you. Wonderful. Would you like red or white? White. - Here you go. - I'll have some red wine. - Who is this man? Our hero? - Hello. - Here he is. - Hey, man. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Good job. My name is Alexander. - I am Denis. Thank you. - Do you really feel no pain? - Do you? - Well, I... - We shouldn't ask these questions. - I just... - No problem. Denis is a cool guy. - I just asked. - I feel it in a different way. I saw it with my own eyes. That was a miracle. - I did it many times... - What about the vic? The vic shitted his pants. He sat on the ground crying like a baby. The guys called me and said that everything went on really well. That was fantastic! Denis, here is to you! You've got little to do with that. To Denis! To Denis! This is what I say! - Here is to Denis! - To us! Here is to the team. Great we have this perfect operation going on. Let's drink to us. In the name of the Russian Federation. October 11, 2017, Moscow. The Moscow municipal court consisting of presiding judge Strigunova with court reporter Polyanskaya, the public prosecutor, Chief of the Department of the Criminal and Court Administration... You will come to us to sign the reports for the complainant. - We'll hear your testimony in court. - Okay, got it. Pasha will tell you what you have to say. Good. This is for you. Your pocket money. Thank you! - Can you open another bottle? - Sure. You are my hero. Oksana... - We'll do everything the right way now. - What is the right way? The right way is to be happy. The court calls the complainant to testify. Denis Polyanskiy. Yes, please. - Hello. - Good afternoon. My name is Denis Polyanskiy. That evening I was late for a meeting with a friend. And... I was going down a street... I don't remember the name now. I came up to the crosswalk. There were no traffic lights there. I didn't see any cars around. Before stepping on to the crosswalk, I looked to the left and then to the right. When I went on to cross the street, I saw a car coming my way. It was going very fast. This woman was driving it. I had no time to step back. - It was too fast. - Your Honor, he is lying. - This is a blatant lie. - Sit down. Silence in the court. I didn't give you the floor. I am warning you. Please, sit down. The car was so fast that I had no chance to step back or to run away. I remember an impact and nothing else. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Any questions from the defense? - None, Your Honor. - How come? Hey there! - What are you doing? Sit down! Here is my final warning! Any questions from the prosecutor? Honorable Court, Your Honor. The statements of the witnesses to the accident have been attached to the case. They fully corroborate the testimony of the complainant. I am asking you to call the ER doctor, who is a witness for prosecution. Yes, please. - Hello, Your Honor. - Hello. I work in the ER of the Municipal Hospital My name is Natalia Kuznetsova. The ambulance unit brought the defendant to the ER for examination. My colleagues here and I found out that she was heavily intoxicated. - What? - Your Honor. I find it an aggravating factor and I ask you to attach the medical report to the case. Yes, of course. Thank you. Any objections from the defense lawyer? - No objections. - Your Honor, this is a setup! I told you to sit down! Here is my final warning! Next time I will order to remove you from the courtroom. I will give you the floor. Okay, let's move on. Next witness, please. You. Senior Patrolman, Senior Lieutenant Pavel Kuznetsov. Here is the thing. Your Honor, on the 24th, I arrived at the site of the accident. I received a call from the control room. On arriving at the site, I called an ambulance to provide medical assistance to the victim. He suggested ceasing the proceedings for a big sum of money. This is enough! Court Marshals, please remove the defendant from the courtroom. - I remember him! Listen to me! - Silence in the court! - Silence in the court! - What are you doing? Stop it! What is going on here? Don't do it! Please! I have the right to testify! Why? Your Honor, please! - I have the right to testify! - Oh God! Do you confirm your testimony that when you arrived at the site, the defendant actively resisted you? - I confirm it. - Thank you. - Oksana Vladimirovna. - All rise. The court shall retire to consider the judgement. Pasha, are you sure they will cover our backs? Absolutely. Well, let's take a look at these wheels. Okay. - The car is awesome. - Oh yes. - Did you see the license plate? - It looks so powerful. When you jump, pull the legs up. I don't want you to break them. - I know. - Right? Okay. Den, can you see this area? It is the thinnest part of the windshield. You should hit it here or there. Try hitting it with your foot. - I can try hitting it with an elbow. - That would be magnificent. Okay. He'll never try to escape. He will call the traffic police. Just what we want. - What if he doesn't? - Why? Is he nuts? We'll find the car with the broken windshield in no time. - Pasha, are we not too conspicuous? - Denis, relax and enjoy yourself. Look at him. He is definitely loaded. He will pull this chick and take her home in a couple of minutes. She is going to be our witness. - It doesn't look good at all. - Relax, Denis. We got covered. Olga will be promoted to a federal judge soon. - What does it mean? - It means that we'll be totally fine. We won't have to milk morons like him. We'll switch over to some serious business. We'll have good fat orders. Go and get ready. Cheer up. Excuse me. No, no! Pasha. No. He dodged me! You see? - What the hell was that? - He dodged me! - What was that? Get in the car! - Pasha! I could not reach him. He dodged me! - He is trying to lose us. - Shut up, you moron! He is loaded. We have every reason to stop him. Black Mercedes, 002, pull over! Son of a bitch, he is trying to play with me. Black Mercedes, 002, pull over! - Pasha, he is getting away. - Shut up! Mikhnevo, 3-9-2-3. I am in pursuit of a black Mercedes, 002-00. He is going down the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. Copy? The driver is intoxicated. He defies an order to pull over. - Motherfucker! - Roger that, 3-9-2-3. - Son of a bitch! - He got away, Pasha. You asked for that! Son of a bitch! Mikhnevo, 3-9-2-3, I lost him. Initiate an interception. Initiating the all-city intercept operation. Black Mercedes... You must fulfil your orders! When you receive an order to jump and damage a car, you must jump and damage the car! Is that clear? Yes, it is clear. Shithead... Asshole... Scumbag... Guys, I am so happy to see you. - Congratulations on your promotion. - Thank you. Wow! Is that for me? Thank you! Come on in. We serve some fantastic drinks over there. - Hi! I am so happy to see you. - You are so beautiful. Look good now? Come on in. You'll find yummy snacks and great drinks over there. Olga! Our dearest Olga. We are so happy they finally promoted you. - Me too. - Congratulations. - Thank you, my dear. - I was thinking what I can say. - Don't say anything. - I will. There are no accidents. You are the right person in the right chair. I totally agree. Thank you so much. - Come on in... - I forgot about the present. Come on in. I am so happy to see you. A fantastic dress. Where did you buy it? I will tell you right away. Thank you. Hello. - I'd like to congratulate you... - Come in. Your mom is waiting. Olga, why did you invite this idiot? What could I do? He is our friend's son. - Hi. - Sweetie... - I am sorry I could not reach him. - No big deal. You'll do it next time. Relax. You got me worried. Oksana. Oksana, I am sorry. I will never get you worried again. - Will you forgive me? - Of course, Denis. - Are you sure? - I am. Relax. You know, you are one and the only. You are... ...unique. You are... You have supernatural abilities. - You are my superhero! - Oksana! Look at me. You are loaded. - I drank a bit. - You are totally drunk, right? I missed you. I missed you, too. You are the best. - Can we go home now? - Okay. Let's go. Oksana, where are you going? Oksana, can you hear me? Look, please, don't do it here. Oksana... - I have to do it now. - Oksana, please, don't do it here. Oksana, can you go off the road? - Can you hear me? Oksana? - Turn around. Den, please help me. I can't do it on high heels. Okay, lean back on me. Now squat. Move your foot. - Is it okay like this? - Yeah. Den, I love you. I love you so much. I waited so long to hear these words. Let's go home. Please, let's go home. - Come in. Watch out. - I am coming. Wait here. - Let me help you. - I can do it. - Take your shoes off. - I can't. - Let's go. - Let's go. Denis, do you know your room? - I do, Oksana. Let's go. - Where is it? Here is your room. Oksana, let me take you to your bed. - Why go to bed with your shoes on? - Can you take them off for me? Oksana, please, fall asleep. Den, do you love me? - Tell me. - Oksana, please, fall asleep! Denis? Open the door! Can you hear me? Well... Can you just say if you love me or not? Why don't you answer? Why doesn't anyone love me? You know, I... I did not want to abandon you. But I was told to do so. I really wanted to keep you. I was told that you had a rare disease... A really rare one. And I... I will not handle it. They told me that people like you don't survive. They can't. I got scared. I was just 16. Please, forgive me. Please... A car hit a man. - A car hit a man. - Where? - Let's go and take a look. - Did a car hit a man? Guys, call an ambulance, please. What's wrong? You didn't feel any pain before. Easy. Easy, easy... - Does it hurt? - Yes. Suck it up. You should quit this game. A couple more jumps would kill you. It's gonna hurt now. This is yours. - Why so little? - Just because. Can I sit? Den, I want to say I am sorry, because... ...I got completely wasted. I talked some bullshit. At some point I was totally out of control. Because I drank too much. Will you forgive me? - What is it? - Something for you. It's a jumpman. I think it can be your amulet. He carries a sword right here. He can use it to protect you. You can hang him in your car. Thank you. He is so cute. Okay, sign the police report next to the check mark. Sign this one twice at the bottom. Oksana will sign it at the top. Because you are still under age. Sign this one at the bottom too. Now you. Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. It is very important for us. We will never let you down again. Oksana, what are you talking about? You know, we are... friends. Who is he? I have never seen him before. On August 29 I exited the college. - I am asking you. Who is he? - After an extra English lesson. I turned right. There was an uncontrolled crosswalk. No traffic lights around. - Can you tell us more about your route? - Yes, of course. I was going down Malaya Gruzinskaya street towards the Tishinskaya square. I came to the uncontrolled crosswalk. My phone rang that very moment. I picked it up. I got distracted for a second. And that very moment, a huge red car approached me really fast. - This man was at the driving wheel. - What? I didn't have any time to react or to run. Red? Mine is not red! - I remember I was hit. - This is total bullshit! - Can I add, Your Honor? - Yes, please do, Mr. Witness. - The complainant got confused. - You can sit down, young man. That was a dark blue Range Rover. Is he color blind? - May I, Your Honor? - I give the floor to the state. Just a short remark. I'd like to add that the complainant was so badly hurt that he could easily miss the color of the car. Thank you. Now, we have got another witness, right? - Me? - You. Please, give your testimony. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Who is she? - Is she a fake doctor? - I am Doctor Kuznetsova N. N. The complainant was admitted to the hospital where I work. He was in a serious condition which was well noted in the medical reports. He suffered from a concussion, multiple bruises and the shock of pain. You can hardly remember the color of the car in this condition. Even if he remembered it the first second, he forgot about it the following one. The boy was in a very, very serious condition. You should be put on trial! He spent two weeks in the ICU. He went through an emergency treatment. Finally feeling ashamed? The case is adjourned. - All rise! - May you burn in hell! Pasha, I am sorry. Why red? I just wanted to... Why red? I just wanted to stretch the story a bit... What about going back to the stretcher? Look me in the eyes. - Please... - Look me in the eyes. I am sorry. I don't want to see you again. I asked you not to drink tap water. Good night to you, too. If you screw up ever again, you will go back to your shitty orphanage. Is that clear? Don't you slam the doors! Why do I have to blush for you? And to say I'm sorry? Please, knock on the door when you want to come into my room. What? This is my place! You are a guest here! Remember that? What are you doing here? Go get ready. - I don't feel well. - I don't care. He is coming. Come here. Let's go through it again since you are so dumb. What do you have to do with your legs? - To pull them up. - What? - To pull them up. - Why? Because... Because otherwise you will break them. You pull the legs up. - What else? - I have to break the windshield. - Say it again. - I have to break the windshield. Let's go. Will they cover our backs? I hope, everything will work out fine today. And no one will have to cover our backs. Time to get ready. Go and get ready then. Are you totally nuts or what? What was that? - I will not jump again. - What was that supposed to mean? I will not jump again. Hear that, Pasha? You want to play a hero or what? I am talking to you! Screw you! Say again! Screw you all! I got you. Do you really think you are that special? We'll find another one. The city is full of trash like you. Don't you come here ever again. Hi... You are parked here, right? You are. Why? Why are you blinking your lights? Why? Are you crying? Keep crying then. And you cry too. What are you doing here? Hey, jumpman. Do you feel ashamed for damaging these cars? Are we far away? No. We are almost there. Do you know why they told you to jump in my car? Some shithead from the Investigation Committee wanted to get one of my factories for next to nothing. I said no. Now he is trying to find a way to stab me in my back. He is throwing trash like you my way. Know what I mean? There are those who jump and those who make other people jump. There are millions of jumpmen. You think about that. - Hey, dudes! - Hey, Den! Hey, Den! - Hi. - Hi, cool cat. - Let's go, dudes! - Are you back? - Hi. - For long? - Meaning? - Are you back for long? Forever, I hope. - Anna! - How did it go? - Okay. What's up? - Nothing. Anna, come here! Denis is back! You look tired. Didn't you like it at home? It didn't work out. I can't say I didn't like it there. It's just... It's complicated. Living at home is difficult. With your mom? It's not only her. Life is too complicated out there. People hate each other. They don't want to hear or understand others. Will you... forgive me? May I come back here? Of course, you may. Here is your home. Thank you. - Easy. 10 seconds. - It's okay. - Keep standing, Den. - Hold on! You can do it. - 20 seconds. - Hang on. Good job! - Hang on! - Come on! You can do it! Shut up! 40 seconds! - Come on, dudes! - Hang on! - You can do it! Another 40 seconds! - 50 seconds! Hang on! Just a little longer! - Just a bit longer! - Keep breathing, Denis! - Hang on! - 1 minute, Den. Hang on! JUMPMAN Subtitles from Register
