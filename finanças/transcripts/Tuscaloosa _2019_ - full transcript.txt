I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever. The University of Alabama campus at Tuscaloosa is under a tight security guard of state police as governor George Wallace made a campaign promise to stand in the doorway himself to prevent the integration of the last all-white state university. 52-year-old George Wallace is expected to run an easy first in the primary election. As president, I will stand up for your local police and firemen in protecting your safety and property. George Wallace was shot down this afternoon as he campaigned not far from Washington. But I say violence is necessary. It is as American as cherry pie. On the third day of August, 1953, my mother and Carmen were on an errand of life, death, and personal freedom. The vehicle was not identified for some days, the bodies burned so completely there was no trace of them. It is my hope that if I keep her in sight, it'll make it possible for me to act myself. Because as it is right now, I am not good for much, though I am in the prime of my life. - Duck, duck, goose, duck, goose, uh, duck, duck, duck, goose. - No, this way. - Oh, oh... I want to do it again, do it again. Do it--I want to do it again. Duck. - You're going to dream yourself to death, son. You got to live in the real world, boy. - I know, Dad. I just-- I need to think some things over, started having some weird visions. - Duck! - Now, this isn't a ploy to get some more Benzedrine, is it? - No, I'm just-- I'm feeling a little strange. - Well, hell, you've been moping around all summer, son. - Dad, as you know, I am a busy man. The grass, it grows very quickly. - I'm not talking about no goddamn colored folk work. I'm talking about a real job. You want to go to Europe or some such place? - Nope, thanks, but I appreciate it. - Come on, now, come on. - I'm heading over to see the sheriff, some of the boys. All right. - Yeah! - Hey, Latham. - Morning. - Can't get this fucking thing done. - Nothing worse than a sticky zipper. Here. - Ooh-la-la. - Shoot. - I appreciate that. - It was my pleasure. - I don't doubt it. - It got torn a little when I was getting the zipper loose. Oh, it's not mine. - What, you borrowed it? - Right. - Well, then, you can tell them it was my fault. - I'll be sure to do that. - Virginia! - Well, I better be going. - Damn you, Billy. - Whoo! - Orderly! - All right. Grab her! - Augh! - Get off! - Celibate -- - Hey, Billy. - Hey, Earl. - Ahh! - Get her down on the ground. - Baron. - Is she new here? - Get off! - What the hell you have on your face? - Sunglasses. - Mm-hmm. It's dark as a tomb in here. Now, you--you understand that that young lady was not what she seemed. - Which young lady, Dad? - You been around the patients your entire life. You know the difference between them and us. - Well, she seemed pretty straight. - I had to come back and sedate her myself before she calmed down. - You ever think there might be more than one way to calm a patient? - Sure, stronger meds, possibly shock treatment. - A lobotomy, right? - Don't be getting wise, Billy. That girl came in here suicidal. She's not your plaything. Don't go messing with her. I do not blame my mother, nor am I angry at her memory. In fact, she's become a beacon for me. - Billy! What are you doing? - Oh, planting geraniums. - I need you to rescue me. - Why is that? - Because I'm not crazy, you dumb shit. Some have said that your views on law and order were similar to those of George Wallace. As far as this problem of law and order is concerned, I am for law and order. ¶ Bobby's all right ¶ ¶ Bobby's all right ¶ ¶ He's a natural-born poet ¶ ¶ He's just out of sight ¶ ¶ Jungle Faced Jake, Jungle Faced Jake ¶ ¶ I said make no mistake ¶ ¶ About Jungle Faced Jake ¶ ¶ Yeah ¶ ¶ Telegram Sam ¶ ¶ You're my main man ¶ ¶ Telegram Sam ¶ In another public demonstration by some citizens opposed to the Vietnam War... ¶ You're my main man ¶ ¶ Telegram Sam ¶ ¶ You're my main man ¶ Covering the campaign, Pierre Salinger, the former press secretary of the late President Kennedy, accused the Nixon administration today of intimidating the news media. This is the news in detail on the hour from the WJRD newsroom. - Hey, bad Billy Mitchell, how you been? - All right. You keeping warm in there, Nigel? - Yeah, they'll have me on white bread by tomorrow. You need some breakfast, Billy? - Give me a pint of barbecue, loaf of bread, and a Coca-Cola. In Minneapolis... amnesty for draft evaders would tear the country apart. Agnew declared... - Those who chose to serve... - Today's meat ain't ready yet. I got a carton of yesterday's. Until this war is over and until we get the POWs back, those who chose to desert their country can live with their choice... - Add in a little of your granddaddy's homegrown, will you, Nigel? - Sure thing, Billy. - In Vietnam yesterday... - My number will be up soon. - Mine too. Shit, you ain't going to Vietnam, whitey. - I hope not. I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcongs. The United States military commander in Saigon says... - Vietnam scares the shit out of me. On the other hand, maybe I could use the discipline. - Seems like a fucked up way to come by discipline. - I could see you crawling around like a cat on a jungle footpath, an M-16 strapped to your back. You'd make a formidable adversary. - Shit, Billy, what you going on about? - The abortion question... - Never mind. Put to 1,500 people last June by the Gallup polling organization. Tonight Gallup says the survey showed... - Here, man, can't forget this. - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Think that the question of whether to have an abortion should be decided solely between a woman and her physician. The Gallup poll also said that 73 % of those interviewed agreed that professional birth control information services and counseling should be made available to unmarried... ¶ Let me tell you ¶ ¶ The truth is in the eyes ¶ ¶ Because eyes don't lie ¶ ¶ Amen ¶ ¶ Remember a smile is just a frown ¶ ¶ Turned upside down ¶ ¶ My friend ¶ ¶ So hear me when I'm saying ¶ - Hey, Billy. ¶ Smiling faces ¶ - Pass that joint, man. - ¶ Smiling faces ¶ - We're almost like brothers, you know. - We ain't never going to be brothers, Billy. I don't care how much you smoke. - Really? Because our moms? - Just because our moms ran off together and got burned up instead don't make us brothers. ¶ Beware of the handshake ¶ - Hey, man. I'm Billy. - Time to turn the meat, Billy. - All right. - Hey, we should hang out more like we used to, Nigel, go on a road trip or something. - Yeah, sure, Billy. - Roll Tide, boys. - Act like a little brother. - Yeah, it's been said many times before. - You ask me, dudes like that, that's the problem. - Billy don't know about all that shit. - You're either part of the problem, or you're part of the solution. ¶ Won't do you no harm ¶ ¶ Because you'll know where he's coming from ¶ ¶ Don't let the handshake and the smile fool you ¶ - They'd kill us if they could. We can stay ahead. - Of course we can. I think I could outrun them on foot. - Calm down. Let's go inside. - Where's Billy? I want to see Billy. - Morning, Froufrou. - Oh, good morning, Dr. Mitchell. - You ready for all those visitors today? - Oh, yes, sir. - Big day. Morning. - A reminder to all visitors, please sign in at reception, and your party will be... - Hi, Billy. - Hey, Earl. ¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶ ¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶ - Oh. - Froufrou. - How you making out? - Oh, I'm fixing to melt. Now, Billy, you just go right on in and see your Daddy. - He can wait his damn turn just like the rest of us. - Yes, sir. - Don't pay any attention to him. - That's the thing. I'm not here to see my daddy. I'm here on a visit. - To whom? - Her name is Virginia. - Absolutely not. You know your daddy would have my head. - I would be goddamned if some little peckerwood snot is going to skip in front of me. - Now, you listen to me, mister, this here is Dr. Mitchell's son. He ain't going to slow you down one little bit. - I don't give a damn if his daddy is George goddamn Wallace, you heifer bitch. Hey, mister. Now, who might you be visiting today? - My wife of 47 years, Mrs. Gertrude Willis. - Oh, I should have known. You're the handsome fellow Gertrude is always going on about. Look, I don't mind if you go ahead of me, sir. I'm just-- I'm here to see my girl. - What's the last name? - I don't know. - I'll help you out this one time, Billy, but if your daddy finds out about this, this is all your doing. - Hi. - This is what you call a rescue? - You like to fish? - Sure. - All right, tell you what, I'll go get my car, and we'll catch ourselves a mess of bluegill. - Oh, hot damn. - Right over here. Nice car. This looks like a road trip car. - It's my dad's. The top leaks a little when it rains, but the eight fat cylinders of her Detroit steel go pounding, you quit caring you're in central Alabama. You can put on the doctor's overalls if you want. - Oh, your daddy's? - Yeah, sure. You can change inside. Now, Virginia, you're not gonna go batshit crazy and try to gut me or something are you? - Oh, not me. All patients must stay within the perimeter of the hospital grounds. - You better duck. Whoo! How fast can this thing go? - You want to see? - I do. Hey... You right-handed or left-handed? - I'm right-handed. - All right. So with your left hand, you're gonna put your-- you're gonna put your thumb on this. You hold that down. At least try not to cast it right over my line. - Okay. You got something. - Here we go. - Reel it in. Come on, reel it in. - All right. Huh? You like that? You want it? I can't believe you caught one. - You want to feel it? - Look at that. - You looking at the new mayor of T-town. - Pass it down the line. - Huey Newton smoking at the revolution. - Right on, man. - Aw, shit. - Stash it, man. By United States aircraft, an estimated 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped against North Vietnamese troops. - Motherfucking white power elite. - That's it. - Tuscaloosa's white power elite. - Fuck those pigs. - Yeah, fucking right. - Ugh! Whoo! So, Virginia, what brings you to Tuscaloosa? - Well, that is hard to say. Well, it would have to be love and hard living and my father, in about that border, though. - I see. - Mm-hmm. You know, but I believe that there is a conspiracy afoot. - Oh, is that so? - Yeah, see, first of all... I'm not crazy. - Oh, no, it doesn't seem so. - No. They can keep me here a few months, but if you don't get me out of here... I will go crazy. - I take it you're not at Branson by your choice? Well, you know what? It's complicated, but the fact that my daddy says I'm crazy is the law. - You know, if you don't mind my asking, Virginia, what did your father say was wrong with you? - He said I was a nymphomaniac. - Oh. - Oh, you do know what that is, don't you? - I do, yes. Well, uh, is it true? Now, well, I am not sure. What are you about there, Billy? - I am not sure. - Augh! No! - Don't misunderstand, Billy. Those-- those are from a long time ago. No, they got nothing to do with this, and... and I'm feeling much better now. - That's good. That's real good. I'm glad you're feeling better about it. - Well, don't get all serious about it. - Okay. - Well, go on about what you were doing, Billy. - We'd better head back. Come on. - Let me try one. - Sure. You know how? - Yeah, I've been watching you. - Ooh. Uh... Fuck this fish. - That was a no-good one anyway. Well, I'll be seeing you, Virginia. - Don't be a stranger, Billy. - Don't you worry about that. - For the most part, I had a real good time. Morning, Fanny. - Good morning, Billy. - Lawn is looking good. You know, Brehard has an opening at the paper. - Cool. - Mm-hmm, I'm glad you think so. He says the interview would be just a mere formality. - Well, I can think I can find it down to visit Mr. Brehard soon. - Good. And what's going on with Nigel? - Well, he seems to be keeping out of trouble. - Well, the sheriff says he's been keeping an eye on him along with some of the other boys at Paradise. - Nigel? - There's some serious political shit going on nowadays. It's not like when you two were boys. - Yeah, well, Nigel is cool. - No matter how well you think you know someone, they can change. ¶ There will be no pictures of pigs ¶ ¶ Shooting down brothers on the instant replay ¶ ¶ There will be no pictures of pigs ¶ ¶ Shooting down brothers on the instant replay ¶ ¶ There will be no pictures of Whitney Young ¶ ¶ being run out of Harlem on the rail ¶ ¶ With a brand-new process ¶ ¶ There will be no slow motion or still life ¶ ¶ Of Roy Wilkins strolling through Watts ¶ ¶ In a red black and green liberation jumpsuit ¶ ¶ That he had been saving for just the proper occasion ¶ - Think they're onto you? - On me? - Your dope. - Maybe. - Pigs. - Yeah, I bet you hate those fucking pigs. - Sure, I say legalize it. - It ain't about that, Billy. How you go to college and get to be so ignorant? - Sitting around here makes you Huey Newton? ¶ The revolution will be no re-run brothers ¶ ¶ The revolution will be live ¶ - Augh. - Hey, Grandpa. - Hot enough for you? How you making out? - I'm tolerable. - These sons of bitches dug themselves clear out. I'm getting too old to hunt. Your daddy and that son of a bitch sheriff come for them about a month ago. - Well, they were, what, tracking down a patient or something? - Hell no. They say that we're outlaws. Well... Ohhh... Let's get on in out of the sun. Whew. So what all you been about? - Well, long and short of it is, I'm mowing the lawns and running the lunatics on the grounds right now. The doctor figures I'm not going to make my mark on the world with a lawnmower. - It don't matter what you do as long as you got character. Take me, for example. I get my satisfaction out of drinking. It's just whatever it is you do, you got to go ahead and do it. If you get your satisfaction out of cutting the grass, then you just go on and cut the grass. - I'm not sure that's what it is, but, yeah. - You got time. I weren't sure drinking was my calling until I was a damn sight older than you are. - Yes, sir. - Don't suppose you brought along a little treat for your old granddad? - How could I forget? - Well, now. Mmm, ahh. - You, uh, are you getting some, boy? - Oh, you know me, Papa, and the truth is... It's more of a rescue. - Well, how's that? - It's a rather sordid tale, but, well, I'm not sure if she's the crazy one or if it's me. - What do you mean, crazy, like, wild, or crazy like them loonies your daddy keeps locked up? - She may be crazy, or, you know, she may be the sanest person I ever met. I feel like I got to do something to help her out. - Well, there ain't but one true path, and that's the one you on, and you don't let nobody run you off, and you don't let nobody make you stop and sit down. - I made you a ladder. Ooh, second time is a charm. - What you got in the bag? - It's a fake groundhog. You be good, I'll let you eat some. - You are too thoughtful. - Careful now. - Very nice. - Yeah, when patients put on scrubs for the first time, it's like they become ghosts. - More like animals. Come on, boy. It's intermission, rise and stretch time, time to refresh yourself and visit our snack bar. Got a yen for a hot popcorn? - Here you go. How's this? Fresh soft drinks are sparkling cold. The juicy... - Hey, you want a drink or something? - Watch out. I know black belt. - Yeah, Bruce Lee is giving lessons. - Hey, those cops the other day, why are they watching you so close? - There's a riot going on, Billy. You just haven't seen it yet. You're too busy mowing lawns and chasing after lunatics. Why don't you try a juicy good hot dog? Mmm, delicious. - Thank you. - You talking shit. We're just three minutes away from the start of our next feature. - Billy, you know what the word "Tuscaloosa" means? - Get with it, man... - No, what? - "Tuscaloosa" is the word for "black warrior" to the Choctaw Indians. - And sitting around here makes you a black warrior? - Billy, it's the same old shit 100 years on. My mama was your mama's maid. My granddaddy worked for your old man and so on. - What are you getting at? - Come on, Jim. Give us a treat. - Billy, I don't think I can pretend to be your friend anymore just because our moms. - Pretend? - Billy, you're either part of the problem or part of the solution. It's two minutes till showtime. - All right. - The refreshment stand will remain open after the feature begins. So you still have time to have some fun watching the movie. Before we begin our next feature, we'd like to remind you to replace your speaker before leaving the theater. If it's accidentally damaged, just notify... - Thank you. - You're welcome. What? - So tell me about your friend, Nigel. - Tell you what? - Anything you know. - Well, not much now. We used to hang out a lot when we were little. - Oh, yeah? - Our mothers, they died in the same fire, and they ran off together. - They ran off? - Yeah, it was a torrid affair. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, that's real romantic, huh? - Maybe so. - Must have been real sad for you. Poor sad Billy. No wonder you're so weird. - I am not so weird. - Oh? It'd make anybody weird. It's nothing to be ashamed of. - Look, I'm not ashamed of anything. I think I'm in love. - I know. And that's why you're going to take me away. Out of Virginia? Hey, you know I would if you wasn't crazy. - Oh, you the crazy one, crazy about me. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2... Time for the show. - Let me go! Let me go! - Orderly! - No! No! I don't want to! - I don't want to! - Settle down. - No! No! Ahh! Augh! Augh! I don't want to. - It's okay. - It's all right. - Don't make me go; don't do it. I don't want to. - Yeah, it's political, man. - Over there, it was, like, black man fighting yellow man for the white man. - Yeah, that's it. - Nigel, you ain't going to 'Nam. - Maybe. - Uh-uh. Why you act so big man, but yet you still so goddamned naive, huh? You ain't going to fight with the brothers, 'cause this dude right here got a deferment with that honky boy's daddy. Why you think that headshrinker give a fuck about you, huh? - 'Cause he's a loony, man. - See, now you playing with the devil, and the devil gonna bite you in the ass. - My number will be up soon, and I ain't killing no gook at the Vietnam, fuck no. - Gook? Don't you be calling nobody no motherfucking gook. You think about some little girl just standing there who you just called her motherfucking gook, watching her mama scream and burn because you just flame-throwed her ass. Try to imagine that with your eyes. - Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Come on up, boy. - Oh, who's this? - Billy, Louise. Louise, Billy. - Hey, Louise. - I almost got caught by the night nurse last week. I think she's been watching me. - Yeah, we--we got to be more careful. - No, I worked it out. See, I complained to Nurse Bickerty about my roommate's nightmares, and she said I should go on stronger meds, but I suggested that I be moved in with a vegetal case. Now we can come and go as I please. - Well, the doctor does like the patients taking a hand in their recovery. You know, sometimes she's all for the up-and-coming health care. - Mm-hmm, like shock therapy. - No, Virginia, they don't do that shit anymore. - Oh, sure, no, not if you behave like Louise here. I think she had a lobotomy. - Well, the doctor hasn't performed a lobotomy in years, so that's... - You know, Billy, I'd rather we didn't talk about your father. - Okay. - You know, one time, I ran my hand across her breast, down her thigh until she became one, started to cough. I like to let the wind blow over her. I think it makes her dream. - You are strange, but in a good way. - Come on, boy. Whoa, careful. - Nice boat. - Thank you. It's not mine. Whoop. Whew. Whoo! This river is kind of spooky. Hold on, I think I got something. - You got a big old mamba coming to bite you, is what you got. - Oh, you fuck off. I got me something bigger than that. - It's a rock... - Or an alligator. - What is it? - It's a rock with flippers. - A turtle. Oh, shit! A turtle. - It's got a nasty beak on it. That can make short work of a finger. - What have you done? - Well, I cut the line. - With the hook still in it? - Well, I couldn't get it back. It swallowed the hook. - Swallowed the hook? - Yeah. - Swallowed the hook? Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you! You're a coward. - Would you rather me, what, cut off his head or something? - Oh, yes, yes, I would, because that is what any sane person would have done, instead of letting it swim around with a hook in its throat for the rest of its life. Can you--can you imagine that, huh, a hook in your throat for the rest of your life, forever? - Yes, I-- - No! No, you can't! - It was a turtle. - No! - It's just a turtle. Hey, come here. Come here. Come on. It was just a turtle. Virginia? - That's why you're good for me, Billy. - We'll take a peek. Hey, get out of the car, boy. Get up there. Get his attention, man. - Looky look. Get your face on that hood, eyes straight ahead. - You keep your hands on the car, boy. - Doesn't talk much. - You are one lucky nigga, boy. I see the devil in you, boy. Get your ass on home. Black Panthers is something we need as an equalizer. It give them something to fear just as we had something to fear for many years. Do unto him before he do unto you. - Boom. We the ones who represent the new generation. We the ones who represent the new train of thought. And we the ones that ain't taking no more shit. Son? What you doing up there? - Reading. - Uh-huh. I'm headed to a lodge meeting. I don't know when I'll be back. - Okay, win big. - Do what? - Nothing, have fun. - Will do. Ow, my face, fuck. - Psst. - What happened to your face? - Oh, a--a lunatic attacked me. Oh. Oh, lordy, you come prepared. - Well, I was a Boy Scout. - Oh, you don't have to worry about me... getting pregnant. - Me, neither. Come on, Nigel. Let's go for a ride. These motherfuckers in Tuscaloosa, they got to take the same licks we put on them in motherfucking Philadelphia, in Detroit, in Watts, and in Harlem. - Oh, man, I'll stay with you. - You can raise it. - You take the pot, Deputy. - Look at that. - That Earl Campbell was riding roughshod over... - Oh, I can tell you, we would be wasting our time on this political bullshit if George Wallace was running. - That's true. - Mm-hmm. - Wallace could stand in the middle of Broad Street in Tuscaloosa and shoot somebody and still wouldn't lose any voters. - I think you're right about that. - Damn right. - You can raise it. - There's one. - I put in a dollar. - Big spender, big spender. - Hey, Al, get me a beer. - You know what my sergeant once told me after burning down a village in Vietnam? The man once said that it becomes necessary to destroy a town to save it. Do it, man. Do it. - Show some respect, boy. - Respect? - Hey, Sheriff. - What in the... Holy... - That goddamned motorcycle. - Fuck! - Get out; here we go. - You son of a bitch. ¶ Forgotten boy ¶ ¶ Forgotten boy ¶ - Al, call for the fire brigade. It's one of them damn - Get me-- get me that patrol car. I want the son of a bitch. - Now, move, move, move. - Oh, I am gonna get me one of those someday. - Yeah, that's good clean fun. - Oh, I love it. Ain't nothing that can catch you. - Oh, you know how to ride one? - Oh, you bet, son. I stole my daddy's one time, came back a week later. Wild. You're a wild one. - I reckon so. It has been said before. - Oh, yeah? - Billy, watch out! - Nigel? - Move over. Whoo! - Did you see a motorcycle? - Oh, yeah, it was going this way. - Nigga left me in the middle of nowhere. - Well, we can catch him. - I'll catch him later. Never mind if I catch him or not. - What the hell is that? - Why am I driving? - Pull up alongside. - Girl, what's wrong with you? - She's nothing. - Oh, hell, get on with it. - Girl, what did you do? - I just waved at the man in the car. - Damn. I owe you one, Billy. I can walk home from here. Whoa. - Is that him? - Yeah. - Yeah, - That is him. Move it. Move this car. - Let's do it. - Oh, Doc, we got him now, I'll tell you what. - We got him! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - I know what you wish. - And what do I wish? - You wish you were him. - Nigel? - Running from the law. - Yeah, that's it. Come on, don't lose him. - Come here, boy! - Who was in the car, Virginia? - It was your daddy in the car, him and three others. - Three other what? - Three other white men. - He took that old Robert road. - Ahh! - He got no place to go over here. Hit the son of a bitch. - Got it. - Knock him off the road. - Yeah! - Getting close. Get me over to him. - Ahh! Ed, stop the car! I got him. God damn, I got him good. Back him up. Get your hands up. - Ahh! Ahh! - Morning, Latham. I'd better do some pruning on those elms out back. - Them azaleas, they're fittin' to get choked off. - Well, better get to the azaleas, I guess. You right about that, Billy. That's why you in charge. Here come Nigel. We fittin' to go on down the store, see if that paint done come in. - Good. That's a good plan. - Latham. That old boy keeps this place looking good. Nigel could learn a thing or two from his granddaddy. Nobody knows more about horticulture than Latham. - Yes, sir. - What happened to your face, son? - Oh, I cut myself shaving. - Are you fixing to get yourself in a heap of shit? - I hope not. - Good, because last night, I saw something so strange, I cannot figure it out. Last night, I saw someone driving your car and a pickled blonde in the passenger seat. - In the El Do? - Yeah. - I just-- I could not figure it out. - What were you doing? - I was taking some money off the sheriff and some other no accounts in a game of poker, and we heard this dirt bike kick up, tear out of there. I look out the window, and the patrol car is burning, like to blow up. - Oh. - Yeah. I mean, you should've seen Hobson. He was apo-goddamned-plectic. He grabbed his gun and went out there, and we took off after the bike, and that's when I saw the car. - Well... - Yeah. I don't mean to be getting in your business, son, but I just-- I couldn't figure it out. Politics is bad business, son. - I know it. - Maybe you do and maybe you don't. Anyway, you got to get back to work. I can hear the leaves falling. - Hey, you catch him? - No, but I did get my $100 from the sheriff. You haven't seen a white woman with a colored girl, have you? - Yes, sir. I did. It was this morning. - Are they headed west? - Yep. - Billy, the doctor will see you now. How many times I got to tell you about those sunglasses? Hard labor is not all it's cracked up to be, huh, son? That newspaper job is looking pretty sweet. - Well, you know the life of a gardener. The cherry trees planted under the supervision of my dear mother have been attacked by a particularly nefarious fungus. The cherries are turning into little raisins before they even have a chance to ripen. - Put the cigarette out, Billy. Now. I'm fixing to make you respectable. I'm meeting with Brehard Sunday afternoon. I expect you to be there, noon sharp. - All right. See you then. - Sit back down. We got a problem here at the hospital. - Yeah? - That young lady, Virginia, I'm afraid she's not very stable. I'm considering a transfer to a more controlled institution. - When? - Soon, possibly very soon, but far enough away so you can concentrate on your job opportunities. - I'm not sure what you mean, Dad. - She's sick, Billy. She has been placed in the official care of the state for good reason. Her case may involve a surgical procedure. - No! - All orderlies to reception. Code red. Orderlies to reception immediately. - What's going on? What happened? Oh, no! - No! - Jesus. - You know what, Billy? I got me a hankering for some barbecue. - Barbecue, you say? - Mm-hmm! That's right. - Hmm. Are you my girl, Virginia? - More than you know. - Well, then, we're going to Paradise. They're open all hours. - Oh, take me there. Take me to Paradise, Billy. Pretty wild. - Oh, yeah. You know all about the seamy underbelly, don't you, Billy? - Hey, Billy. - Hey. Hey, buddy. Have you seen Nigel Rathberry around? He's--he's big. - He's my cousin. Oh. - Well, how about a pie and a loaf of bread and two Cokes? Thank you, kindly. - He troubling you, Randy? - Yeah. - Should I whip his butt? - Yeah. - Hi, Nigel. - You need something, Billy? - Oh, Billy here was just wanting some barbecue. - Uh-huh. - Maybe something went down at the hospital, so we-- - Yeah, his daddy is thinking about maybe sending me away. - Or worse. - I think the doctor has other things to worry about, Billy, but if it troubles you, why don't you take the El Do and go away? It could do you good to take that road trip. - Yeah. I got something for you. - How you feeling now, Billy? - I feel fine. - It's a good feeling, isn't it? Yeah, I wish I was feeling that way right now. - Yeah, I wish you were too. - It's the only way to feel. - Yeah. - Billy, how come you always come around here hanging? - Oh, I like it. That's all. - You like it? - Yeah. I feel a connection. - How we was like brothers? - It's kind of weird time to talk about-- - Actually, Billy, I think you should expand on that right here. - I ain't never really figured it out. Uh... you know, I been having visions. - Visions? - Religious visions or some shit? - No. I've--I've been, uh, seeing our mothers in my dreams, and they're being chased by the doctor. And he's acting like a lunatic, and I believe I'm coming to an understanding. - I believe you're out to a long lunch, Billy. - Possibly so. - You best forget about that shit. That shit is over. It's a new time now. - You ever catch him? - Catch him? - The guy on the motor bike. - His name is Antoine. No one has seen him since the day your old man and the sheriff was after him. - Now you're talking shit now. I don't-- no, they said they never caught him. It was just-- - Never caught him, my ass. Damn. - You going to have to figure out what side of the line you stand on before you come back around here. Am I making myself clear? - Virginia, we--we better go. - Oh, the party's just started. - You stay out of trouble. - No, you stay out of trouble, Nigel. - All right, Billy. - Look, I'm going to come back. And we're--we're gonna talk, all right? - Do what you have to do, Billy. - Bye, Nigel. Sorry we didn't get to chat more. - Oh, I've got some big news for you, son. - I've got some heavy things on my mind right now, Virginia. - Mm-mm, big news. And you know what? You ain't gonna to hear it until we go to the beach. - I'm not taking you to the river right now, Virginia. - Yeah, fuck the river. I'm talking about the real beach, the ocean. - It's almost six hours from here. I just-- I just got to get you back. - If you don't take me to the beach, I am through with you, Billy. - Are you serious? Well, is it good news or bad news, because I-- look, I can't take much more bad news right now. - Well, that all depends on whether or not you drive me to the beach. - Well, that's all there is to it. We're going to Gulf Shores. We better stop and get some whiskey. - Mm-hmm. - Otherwise, I will fall asleep. ¶ You're dreaming ¶ - So what do you think about the Tide, fellas? - We undefeated. - Bear Bryant is on the way out. - With that defense playing the way it is? - Yup! Well... - Thank you. Thank you. - Keeping Al on his feet. - Your bet to this nonsense going on. You got the queen-jack, Doc. You bet. - You know what's ripe, is your daughter, Daisy. She looks damn fine. - Now, you be careful the next thing comes out of your mouth, boy. - Why don't you shut up and deal? - I'm just saying, we are the law. I mean, We can do what we want. I'll go grab her by the cooch. - Damn it, boy! ¶ I'm not sleeping ¶ ¶ I'm not walking ¶ ¶ And you can't hear my talking ¶ - God! What the hell? - You know, actually, there are two secrets. Which do you want to hear first? - The first one. - I'm going to tell you the second one first. - Tell me the second one, then. - Your daddy is onto us. - I was afraid of that. - I mean, he's definitely onto us. - Definitely. - Oh, definitely. Yeah. See, he come up to the ward this evening talking about how he was-- he was gonna send me to an Ohio asylum for women... - Ohio? What... - With strong emotions. Mm-hmm. And then he had me put in a different room, and he--oh, he told old Bickerty to keep an eye on me, because I'm a subversive element. - How'd you get back in your old room? I clumped her one. - What--excuse me? - I clumped her one on the head. - With what? - With mine. - With your head? - I gave her what for. - What was the first secret, then? - I'm not going to tell you that one until we get to the beach. - Hey, so, uh, what's that first secret? - Your sorry seed has taken root in me. - Oh. Virginia. Virginia, where you going? Virginia. If we don't go back, I'm-- don't misunderstand me. All right? I'm just-- we're gonna have to go somewhere. I'll have to get a job. We need to figure out how to-- - You want to go back. You coward. You think-- you think you're brilliant, but you are a turd. - I beg you not to harangue me, Virginia. I'm just-- - This is real, so you better get off your sad ass now, and you can cut that dreaming shit out. - Are you sure? Are you sure you're pregnant, because... Ahh! - Ahh! Oh! Oh! Oh, shit. Augh. Why did you bite my fucking finger? I don't... - I'm sorry. - I thought you said you couldn't. I thought you said--I thought you said you couldn't. Oh, shit. - I didn't think that I could. - Wh... how? - I was. - You were what? - I was pregnant when I got to Tuscaloosa. But they took it out of me first thing, and I thought they fixed me. - Oh, Virginia, they don't do that sort of-- they don't do that... They don't do that sort of thing. - They don't do that sort of thing? What the hell are you talking about? Why do you think that I was shut up? I was pregnant with a black man's baby, and my psychotic father tied me up and brought me to Tuscaloosa. - Oh, I thought it was because your-- because you tried to... your ankles. - It was a long time ago. My daddy just freshened them up some. - Jesus. - When I got there, your daddy laid me down on the table and gave me some gas. And when I woke up, I was empty... And, you know, maybe it's a bit early, But I intend to keep this one. It's mine. Mine. - How you doing, man? - Thanks. ¶ Let me tell ya ¶ ¶ The truth is in the eyes ¶ ¶ 'Cause the eyes don't lie ¶ ¶ Amen ¶ ¶ Remember ¶ ¶ A smile is just a frown turned upside down ¶ ¶ My friend ¶ ¶ So hear me when I'm saying ¶ ¶ Smiling faces ¶ ¶ Smiling faces sometimes ¶ ¶ Yeah they don't tell the truth ¶ ¶ Smiling faces ¶ ¶ Smiling faces tell lies ¶ ¶ And I got proof ¶ ¶ Beware ¶ ¶ Beware of the handshake ¶ ¶ That hides the snake ¶ ¶ Can you dig it?

What? - Those blueticks? - Oh, yeah. - Hi. Hi, guys. Hi, there, cuties. - Who the fuck is that? - It's me, Papa. - Well, hey, boy. Who's that messing with my dogs? - Oh, she's a lunatic. I knocked her up, and we're running away to California. Can she stay here for the day? - I reckon if you willing to vouch for her good character. - Oh, she's a gem, Papa. - Oh, yeah? Hey, what did you do to that finger? - I slammed it in a door. - Ooh. Looks like a damn plum. - Yup. - What you need is some medical attention. - You got any? - Shit. - Hey, he said it's fine. - Of course he did. - Hey. - Hey, little guy. Isn't he the cutest? - Hey, if, uh, Papa gets too drunk or mean, just ask him why they call him possum. He'll be telling that story by the time I get back. I love you. - Hey, Billy. - How y'all doing? - Oh, not bad. - All right,. - Hey, Billy, there's some, uh, people looking for you. - Yeah, I'm late for my appointment with Mr. Brehard, my dad. - Appointment shit. Ain't no appointments today. Didn't you hear the news? - What news is that? - They done blown up Sheriff Hobson's office. - Anyone hurt? - Not bad. One of them deputies had his arm cut up, but he'll be all right. Yeah, Sheriff Hobson says it's one of them crazy niggers for sure, and he went out to your granddad's to get the dogs. - Virginia! Virginia! - Over here, Billy. - Oh. - [Laughing. - Oh! Oh, baby, I was afraid the doctor got you. - Oh, no. You just missed him. Papa hid me. He's something crafty, this one. - He came for the dogs. Though what he's hunting this time of year beats me. - Oh, they weren't hunting. They're were chasing outlaws. - Ah. You got time to stay for a drink? - Naw. We better hit it before I change my mind. - We sure appreciate your help, Papa. - Aww. Oh. - You come and visit us. - Yeah. I might just take me one of them jet airplanes out there. They say it's something special. - Well... - Ah, ahh, boy. - I love you, Papa. - You too, boy. - Bye, Papa. - Bye-bye. You drive safe now. - You know I won't. - Back so soon? - Actually, we're leaving. Come to say good-bye. - You finally taking that road trip. I guess so. Well, yeah. Taking a road trip myself. Oh, you better hit it if you're going. They're taking some dogs down to the station. I hear it's a real mess down there. Yeah, I heard that too. Billy, I think we should get going. Nigel, if you think they're on to you, you can run. I ain't going nowhere. The shit is here, and you're in it. Put your hands up! Now, Billy, you and that girl just step out of the way. God damn it! Go on! Hey. Hey! Get up there. I said--you deaf? You like playing with fire? Play with fire, you get burnt. Who done it, huh? - Now what the hell is going on here? - Nothing. There is nothing going on here. - What are you doing with your perpetrator, Billy? - Perpetrator? - Yeah, well, you see, Doc here has a notion that that boy is behind some of the shit that's been blowed up lately. - Well, hell, we were all here when it happened. Hell, we were here from, what was it, midnight until dawn? - Doing what? - To be honest, we were drinking, and we did have a little bit of marijuana, but we didn't blow nothing up. - Is that a fact? - Yes, sir. - Do you know that he is a nefarious goddamned criminal? - Well, he might be one, but last night, he was right here. - Y'all sure about this? You the one that he done busted out, ain't you? - I busted myself out. Well, I'll be. Okay, I guess I'll let you deal with her, Doc. My, my, my, I bet you know who blew up my office, huh? Talk! - I'll have you know, I'm not buying any of this horse shit. - It's true. - You want to meet my dog? - I think you'd might even have tried to blown me up yourself. It don't matter; I figure I'll never see you again. - No. - Taking her along with? - That I am. I need to know some things. - What's that? - Well, I suspect you're a bad man. Ahh! - Maybe I am, but I think all these things are relative. That's bullshit. - Now you're young yet. Maybe someday you'll understand. - No. No, I'll never understand. - I tell you, nothing will break you. Nothing will break you like loving a crazy person. - You hear me, boy? - Mom wasn't the crazy one, Dad. - A world of trouble. Oh, you in a world of trouble. I got in mind to put them dogs on you right now. You best tell me what you know. Your life would be a lot easier, son. - Ooh! Oh! It's going to be another day, another day. We'll get you. - Nigel. Hey, you all right? Makes me fucking sick, man. We're all free. - Do you think you're a hero, Billy? - I'm sorry about your head. - I'm not worried about my head. - Nigel. Nigel, you know-- - Shut up, Billy. - Well, you're like a-- a brother to me. You are. I know this sounds funny, but it's true. - Never mind that shit, Billy. I'm fixing to tell you something. What? Anything? - I'm not your fucking brother. - Oh! I know your dad killed our moms, Billy. They never got out of Tuscaloosa. - Ohh! The babies, they'd be awake by now. - Yeah. You reckon we should go back for them? It makes me wonder. I wonder if his motive is more than we thought. It's a spiritual thing. ¶ Our bodies break ¶ ¶ And the blood just spills and spills ¶ ¶ But here we sit ¶ ¶ Debating math ¶ ¶ It's just a shame ¶ ¶ My hand just kills and kills ¶ ¶ There's gotta be an end ¶ ¶ To that ¶ ¶ There's gotta be an end ¶ ¶ To that ¶
