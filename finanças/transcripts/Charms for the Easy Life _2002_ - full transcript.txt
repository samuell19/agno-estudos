Woman: I WASN'T A WITNESS TO THE EARLY PART OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S LIFE. BUT THIS IS HOW I IMAGINE IT BEING. MY MOTHER WAS THE ONLY CHILD OF THE FAMOUS MISS CHARLIE KATE, MY GRANDMOTHER, KNOWN FOR HER EXPERTISE IN HERBAL CONCOCTIONS, MIDWIFERY, GENERAL ALL-AROUND HEALING. CHARLIE KATE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE PLACE OF HER YOUTH, BUT THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT THAT DESIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. THOSE THAT WERE IN NEED COMMITTED SUICIDE INSTEAD OF PAYING A NICKEL. SHE TRIED PRACTICING FOR FREE, BUT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD THAT CONCEPT. MY GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY WAS NOT LEAVING POOR. SHE HAD CURED THE RICHEST MAN IN THE COUNTY OF SYPHILIS, AND IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS HEALTH, HE PROMISED TO RE- MEMBER HER IN HIS WILL. NOT A YEAR LATER, HE WALKED IN FRONT OF A CHICKEN TRUCK AND FELL OVER DEAD. HE KEPT HIS WORD. MY GRANDMOTHER INHERITED A PACKARD TOURING CAR. SHE HAD TO TAKE HER FAMILY IN SEARCH OF A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD APPRECIATE HER KNOW-HOW. THE OPPORTUNITY CAME MUCH QUICKER THAN SHE HAD IMAGINED. Charlie: STOP THE CAR. STOP THE CAR. Men: Man: HURRY. YOU'RE LUCKY THAT ROPE WAS RIDING SO HIGH ON YOUR NECK, SIR. KEPT IT FROM BEING SNAPPED. CAN YOU SPEAK? BREATHE EASY. THAT'S IT. CAN YOU SAY YOUR NAME? I NEVER HAD ONE I LIKED. ALL I CARES TO KNOW IS... I'M SITTING HERE ALIVE. WELL, I'M GLAD WE WERE PASSING BY IN TIME, FOR YOUR SAKE. WHO SHOULD I SAY SAVED ME? MISS CHARLIE KATE WOULD BE FINE. CHARLIE KATE. THERE'S A NAME I LIKE. THANK YOU. I CHOSE IT MYSELF. HE'S ALL RIGHT NOW, CHARLIE, WE CAN GO. MISS CHARLIE KATE, YOU HAVE THE HANDS OF A HEALER. I'M GETTING A NUDGE FROM SOMEBODY UP TOP TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. IT NEEDS PASSING ON... ANYWAY. THIS HERE IS THE FOOT OF A WHITE GRAVEYARD RABBIT, CAUGHT UNDER A FULL MOON BY A CROSS-EYED NEGRO WOMAN. IT BRINGS THE EASY LIFE TO THOSE THAT CARRY IT. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE IT. WOULD YOU SAY BEING LYNCHED WAS EASY? I'M BREATHING, AIN'T I? HMMM. MISS CHARLIE... HAVE YOURSELF AN EASY LIFE. DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU CALL EASY. YOU OUGHT TO THROW THAT OLD CHARM AWAY, CHARLIE. NO TELLING WHAT SORT OF CRITTERS IT'S CARRYING. Woman: MY GRANDMOTHER HAD SUSPECTED FOR A LONG TIME THAT SHE'D MARRIED AN IDIOT. THAT CONFIRMED ALL HER SUSPICIONS. WHAT I OUGHT TO DO IS MAKE A CHAIN FOR IT. WHO WAS THAT MAN? Man: NO ONE YOU NEED TO THINK OF. Narrator: MY GRANDFATHER DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WATCH HIS WIFE BECOME BETTER AND BETTER AT WHAT SHE LOVED. LATER ON HE LEFT THE WAY SAD MEN LEAVE. HE DIDN'T COME HOME FROM WORK ONE DAY. CHARLIE KATE CHOSE WAKE COUNTY TO BESTOW HER HEALING. GOOD DAY. WAKE COUNTY SUITED MY GRANDMOTHER JUST FINE. IT WAS A PLACE WHERE JUST ABOUT EVERY EAR LISTENED TO HER AND EVERY MOUTH SHUT UP WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING. THAT IS ALL EXCEPT FOR MY MOTHER, WHO WAS BUSY TALKING HERSELF INTO MARRYING THE FIRST IDIOT SHE MET. IT RAN IN THE FAMILY. DESPITE MY GRANDMOTHER'S WARNINGS ABOUT THE DOWNFALL OF LOVING A MAN SO RICH THAT HE NEVER HAD TO WORK A DAY IN HIS LIFE, MY MOTHER BECAME A MRS. AND MY GRANDMOTHER PRETENDED THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SON-IN-LAW. OH, MOTHER! ARE YOU AT LEAST COMING TO THE RECEPTION? I'D RATHER DIE. BESIDES, I HAVE BUSINESS TO CONDUCT. I'M SORRY, DARLING. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE BEEN PUTTING IN SEWAGE LINES ALL OVER THIS CITY. BUT NOT WHERE I LIVE OVER ON BEALE STREET. EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN PETITIONED. NOW, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE UP FOR RE-ELECTION. I'M SURE PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT YOU WOULD RATHER THEY WALKED IN THEIR OWN WASTE THAN INTO A CLEAN FUTURE. MISS CHARLIE, I THOUGHT THAT BEALE STREET WAS A COLORED NEIGHBORHOOD. I DIDN'T KNOW... DID YOU KNOW BEALE STREET WAS WHITE? NOW IF I'D KNOWN IT TO BE A WHITE AREA, MISS CHARLIE, WE WOULD'VE PUT IN A SEWER SYS... WELL THAT IS DISGUSTING. IT SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES IS CRIMINAL. JUST GET IT DONE! MISS CHARLIE KATE! MISS CHARLIE KATE? MA'AM? MA'AM? DO YOU PULL TEETH TOO? I HAVE GOT A TOOTH THAT IS CAUSING ME SUCH BOTHER. OPEN YOUR MOUTH. Narrator: SEWAGE LINES WERE INSTALLED IMMEDIATELY. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO USE THE THINGS. Crowd: WHAT YOU ALL LOOKING AT? WHAT? DON'T ANY OF YOU KNOW HOW? NO, MA'AM. WON'T YOUR INNARDS FALL OUT? WHAT IF YOU CAN'T GET UP? DOES IT HURT? NO. COME ON IN, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW. COME ON. SUE, COME ON. Man: BE CAREFUL, SUE. JUST SLIP UP YOUR SKIRT AND SIT RIGHT THERE. THERE. THAT'S NOT SO HARD, IS IT? NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S JUST FINE. Narrator: SO MY GRANDMOTHER TRAINED THE NEIGHBOR HOOD TO FLUSH AND ADDED A TRUCKLOAD OF PATIENTS TO HER PRACTICE. BUT HER MOST IMPORTANT PATIENT WAS MY MOTHER. I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T GO INSIDE, MOMMA. HE'S NOT EVEN HOME. YEAH, WELL HE WOULDN'T BE. I ASSUME HE'S OUT WITH ONE OF HIS GIRLFRIENDS. TAKE THAT SOUND AS TO MEAN A YES? OH, CAN'T WE GO IN THE HOUSE? NOT TILL HE'S DEAD. YOUR HUSBAND IS, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, HONEY, YOU'RE DOING FINE. ALL RIGHT, HEAD'S COMING. THIS IS... NOW THIS IS THE ONE, ALL RIGHT, HONEY. OH, YEAH. PUSH! YEAH. AH! YOU... YOU'VE GIVEN THE WORLD A BABY GIRL. OH, SHE'S A BIG BABY. LET ME SEE HER, LET ME SEE HER. JUST HOLD ON. WHILE I GET THIS UMBILICAL... HURRY, MOMMA. I CAN'T WAIT. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE COME. OH, YES. YES. OH-H, HO-HO! A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL. OH, YES. OH, YOU JUST GO TO YOUR MOMMA. AWW. HELLO, MY DARLING. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CALL HER? MARGARET. MARGARET. I LIKE THAT. OH, SEE. HE WAS GOOD FOR SOMETHING, WASN'T HE, MOMMA? I'LL TAKE THAT SILENCE AS A YES. YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS CALLS FOR A LITTLE OF MY DANDELION WINE... TO CELEBRATE. COME ON, MARGARET! OKAY, YOU KEEP UP NOW. SOPHIA! TIME IS TICKING. HOW COME WE HAVE TO GO SEE SO MANY DEAD PEOPLE? WELL, WE SHOULD ALL SEE DEAD PEOPLE AT SOME POINT, MARGARET, BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE DEAD SOME DAY. HOW COME YOU WEAR THAT ALL THE TIME? BECAUSE MY MOTHER DID AND HER MOTHER DID BEFORE HER. AND THESE SHOES ARE MY MOTHER'S TOO. I WEAR THEM FOR THE SAME REASON. ALL RIGHT. AFTERNOON, CHARLIE. OFF TO MIDWIFE TODAY? I'LL INFORM THE MORGUE. THAT'S MISS CHARLIE KATE TO YOU AND IT'S ANOTHER SUICIDE. I'M ASSUMING IT'S ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS. MY PATIENTS FEAR OUR LORD TOO MUCH TO KILL THEMSELVES. WELL, THEY OUGHT TO FEAR YOU INSTEAD. MAYBE THEY'D ENJOY BETTER HEALTH. AND YOU SHOULD TRY MEDICAL SCHOOL. WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE YOU? BECAUSE I'M BETTER THAN HE IS AND MEN HATE IT WHEN YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEY ARE. AND THEY LEAVE YOU. DO YOU THINK I'LL BE A DOCTOR SOME DAY? HONEY, YOU'LL BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T READ THAT TRASH YOUR MOMMA READS, YOU'LL JUST BE FINE. WHAT SHOULD I READ? WELL, AT LEAST TWO BOOKS A WEEK. ONE FICTION, ONE NON-FICTION. IF YOU DO THAT, I'M SATISFIED YOU'LL KNOW JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. WHO KILLED THEMSELVES TODAY? A COUSIN. SLASHED HER WRISTS OVER RUDOLPH VALENTINO. ANOTHER HOPELESS ROMANTIC LIKE YOURSELF. HOW COME YOU'RE HOPELESS, MOMMA? BECAUSE SHE MARRIED YOUR FATHER. AND HE HAS TOO MANY GIRLFRIENDS? FUNNY HOW EVERYONE NOTICES BUT YOU. YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S ONE TO TALK, MARGARET. SHE DROVE YOUR GRANDFATHER SO MAD, HE DECIDED JUST NOT TO COME HOME ONE DAY. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. HE COULD HAVE BEEN IN A FATAL ACCIDENT AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET HOME. OH, MOTHER. WELL, I ALWAYS WAS A GREAT FOOL ABOUT THAT MAN. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO REPEAT MY MISTAKES. THERE'S DADDY RIGHT OVER THERE. Margaret: THAT'S ONE OF HIS GIRLFRIENDS, THE ONE HE LIKES BEST. Charlie Kate: WELL, YOU WASTED YOUR BRAIN ON THAT ONE. Margaret: AS I GREW OLDER, I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S. SHE LET ME HELP WITH THE HERBS AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITH THE PATIENTS. THE NAME OF MY GRANDFATHER NEVER CROSSED HER LIPS. BUT HIS PRESENCE WAS ALWAYS FELT IN HER HOME. FOR A WOMAN THAT PREACHED THE ART OF GETTING OVER MEN, I'M NOT SURE THAT SHE FOLLOWED HER OWN ADVICE. Franklin Roosevelt: Margaret: GRANDMA? THERE'S A FEW MORE OUT THERE. WELL, THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HEALTH LONG BEFORE I GOT HERE, I GUESS THEY'LL WAIT A COUPLE MORE MINUTES. Roosevelt: I HOPE THE UNITED STATES... OH, MARGARET, TURN THAT NUMB- SKULL OFF. THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE IS NEUTRAL. IF I HAD MY WAY, HITLER WOULD HAVE LEPROSY AND A BAD CASE OF POISON IVY. THANK YOU FOR HELPING OUT TODAY, HONEY. YOU'RE GETTING VERY GOOD. I AM? YEAH. AND MAYBE IT'LL BE WHAT YOU DO EVENTUALLY. OH, I HOPE SO. GRANDMA, HOW COME YOU STILL KEEP HIS CLOTHES? WELL, THERE'S NO REASON TO THROW THEM AWAY. YOU GO ON HOME NOW, HONEY, BEFORE YOU GIVE YOUR MOTHER SOMETHING ELSE TO WORRY ABOUT. MAYBE YOUR FATHER WILL ACTUALLY BE THERE. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, HONEY. SHE WAS ALWAYS CRAZY ABOUT HIM, BUT SHE SAID HE WAS A NITWIT. WHY'D SHE MARRY HIM, THEN? AS THE STORY GOES, HE SANG TO HER AND SHE DIDN'T FIND HIM TOO ANNOYING WHEN HE DID. I WONDER IF I WILL EVER UNDERSTAND HER. MY MOTHER IS A MYSTERY, MARGARET. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW. IT'LL ONLY HURT YOUR BRAIN TO TRY TO FIGURE HER OUT. DO YOU MISS HIM? OH, I DON'T KNOW. DOESN'T EVERY GIRL MISS HER DADDY? YES. YOU HAVE A FATHER. IF YOU SAY SO. YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND EXACTLY LIKE YOUR GRANDMOTHER, AND, FRANKLY, THAT FRIGHTENS ME. NOW... HOW DOES THIS LOOK? BUT YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING ANYWHERE. HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF DRESSING UP? SOMETIMES I WONDER WHOSE CHILD YOU ARE. YOU LOOK FINE. I AM FAR FROM FINE. HEY. SOPH... HEY! SOPHIA, COME ON. HEY. WHY IS THIS IN YOUR PANTS INSTEAD OF ON YOUR FINGER? IT UPSETS HER TO SEE IT. MA'AM. MOTHER. IS HE DEAD ALREADY? IS HE SICK? WELL, HIS FACIAL CAPILLARIES ARE EXPLODING DAILY. IT'S A SURE SIGN OF SOMETHING UGLY TO COME. WELL COULDN'T YOU JUST HURRY THINGS ALONG? SOPHIA! JUST HAVE SOME PATIENCE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR FREEDOM. HE'S SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN OUR LIVES. MAY I BORROW THIS? CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. Margaret: MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SAID, "I DO NOT PERFORM VOODOO, I DO NOT EVEN DABBLE." MY MOTHER WAS OF A DIFFERENT PERSUASION. HE'S GONE. GO START THE COFFEE. I'LL CALL MOTHER. OKAY. HE NEVER EVEN REMEMBERED OUR BIRTHDAYS. NOW HE'LL REALLY HAVE AN EXCUSE. GRANDMA... I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER SET FOOT IN OUR HOUSE. HE'S DEAD. WHERE'S THE BODY? UP THERE. WHY DO WE DO THIS AGAIN? BECAUSE MY MOTHER DID AND HER MOTHER DID BEFORE HER. THAT'S HER ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. WELL, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING. WHAT'S TAKING THEM SO LONG? HIS DIAGNOSIS IS GOING TO BE THE SAME AS HERS. YOUR FATHER'S FAMILY WANTED A CERTIFIED CORONER. CERTIFIED. I'LL GIVE THEM A CERTIFICATE. THEIR SON WAS A NITWIT. WELL, IT WAS AS MISS CHARLIE KATE STATED. IT WAS A CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE. WHAT'S THAT DO TO YOU? LET HIM TELL YOU, HONEY. I'LL GO UP AND CLEAN THE BODY. Sophia: SO... WHAT'S A CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE LIKE? OH, UM... I'M NOT SURE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT, MA'AM. ESPECIALLY WITH A YOUNG LADY PRESENT. OH, SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF. AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED IF I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW. WELL, UH... I-IT STARTS WITH A VERY BAD HEADACHE. HOW BAD, EXACTLY? WELL, SO BAD THAT HE WOULD HAVE WOKEN UP FROM IT. HE-- HE WOULD'VE LOOKED AROUND. NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS, NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK. WELL, H-HIS BODY WOULD HAVE BECOME RIGID. HIS HEAD WOULD HAVE JERKED BACK, ARCHING HIS BACK. AND THEN WITH HIS ARMS AND LEGS OUT STRAIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OH, UH, I, UH, I AM SORRY, MA'AM. DON'T BE. I'M NOT. WE HAVE THE HOUSE TO OURSELVES NOW. I SHOULD BE GOING. Margaret: MY MOTHER WAS WRONG. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE HOUSE TO OURSELVES. MY GRANDMOTHER MOVED IN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. DOES THAT-- MM! NOT ONLY DID MY GRANDMOTHER DECIDE TO MOVE IN WITH US, BUT HER THRIVING MEDICAL PRACTICE CAME ALONG WITH HER. I'M FINE. LET'S GO. RIGHT HERE. SHE SAYS HER LOVER LEFT HER. OH. WHAT'S YOUR NAME, HONEY? PEARL. PEARL. WELL, PEARL, DID HE LEAVE YOU FOR A PRETTIER, SMARTER GIRL? SHE WASN'T SMARTER. MM-HMM. AN HERBAL SACHET? YEAH. PEARL, YOU JUST REST YOURSELF THERE A MINUTE, WILL YOU? YOU GOT TO GET SOME HUMOR BACK. DEPRESSION IS TERRIBLE FOR THE COMPLEXION. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BE DEPRESSED ABOUT. SIT UP STRAIGHT. I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS, MOTHER. WELL YOU SHOULDN'T BE. YOU SHOULD BE OUT HELPING THEM, LIKE MARGARET. IT'S NOT ME. IT NEVER HAS BEEN. I'M SICK OF ALL THIS HEALING. IT'S ALMOST 1940. I WANT TO DO SOMETHING EXCITING. MAKE YOURSELF A CUP OF MUSHROOM TEA. NOW... PEARL, YOU PUT THIS UNDER YOUR PILLOW. AND YOU SLEEP ON IT SEVEN NIGHTS IN A ROW. Pearl: BUT WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK? WELL, THEN, YOU JUST GET OVER HIM, HONEY. I'M GOING TO THE PICTURES. SEE A COMEDY. * YOU MUST GO YOUR WAY * AND I MUST GO MINE * BUT NOW THAT OUR LOVE DREAMS * * HAVE ENDED * WHAT'LL I DO * WHEN YOU ARE FAR AWAY * AND I AM BLUE * WHAT'LL I DO? * WHAT'LL I DO * WHEN I AM WOND'RING WHO * * IS KISSING YOU * WHAT'LL I DO? Margaret: WHO IS THAT? IT'S MY FATHER. MOTHER, YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH HIM. I CAN'T TALK NOW. TAXI'S WAITING. THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING, MOTHER. WHERE HAS HE BEEN ALL THIS TIME? I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE'S HERE NOW. THAT'S WHAT I DO KNOW. WHY? HERE TO DO WHAT? WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT PRACTICE, WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY. WHAT DOES HE WANT? I DON'T KNOW, HONEY. I JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT. DON'T EVEN EYE HIM, MARGARET. HE'S NOT WORTH THE ATTENTION. WHERE'S SHE GOING? GOD ONLY KNOWS. WHAT ON EARTH HAS SHE DONE? HELLO? Charlie Kate: MARGARET? MARGARET? YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL, MOTHER. IT'S A TELEPHONE. WHERE ARE YOU? Charlie Kate: THE SIR WALTER HOTEL. COME GET ME. WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE. DON'T STARE AT ME. TAKE ME HOME. WHAT IS GOING ON? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. - WHAT HAPPENED? - NONE OF YOURS EITHER. MOTHER, FOR GOD'S SAKE. YOU DISAPPEAR FOR TWO DAYS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH OURSELVES. IF IT'LL KEEP YOU QUIET, I'LL TELL YOU. THAT WOULD BE NICE. HE'S HAD ANOTHER WOMAN ALL THESE YEARS. NOW SHE'S DEAD AND HE WANTS HIS OLD LIFE BACK. I DECIDED NOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM. YOU SATISFIED? CAN WE GO NOW? GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. HOW YOU FEELING? ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? ALL RIGHT. WILL YOU STOP RUNNING AROUND THE SUBJECT? YOU AND YOUR MOTHER. SOMETIMES I THINK YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE LIKE HERE. WHICH, FRANKLY, FRIGHTENS ME TO DEATH. IT'S BEEN MONTHS. I'M FINE. STOP ASKING. NOW THAT'S PROBABLY SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T FINE AND NEEDS TO BE. HELLO? DID HE PURGE? ALL RIGHT. WHO WAS THAT? YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. YOUR FATHER'S DEAD. HOW IS SHE? WELL, HE WAS HER FATHER. BOUND TO BE A SHOCK. AND SHE'S OF A WEAKER NATURE THAN YOU OR I. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SO UPSET ABOUT. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE MAN. DID HE PURGE? YES. WHAT'S IT MEAN TO PURGE? WHEN SOMEONE FOAMS AT THE MOUTH UPON DYING, IT INDICATES A GREAT BACK JAM OF TRUTHS AND DESIRES AND WISHES THAT THEY NEVER SPOKE. PURGING SPILLS IT OUT OF THEM. LIKE A DEAD MAN SAYING HE'S SORRY. YES. DID MY FATHER PURGE? YES. WELL SUPPOSE HE HADN'T? WELL, WE WOULD HAVE SOLD HIS BODY TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AT CHAPEL HILL, THEY WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT WAS BEST. WELL, MOTHER, WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO WITH YOURSELF NOW THAT YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A WIDOW? YOU THINK I WANT ANOTHER MAN? I WOULD RATHER TAKE A POISON PILL THAN TAKE ANOTHER MAN. WE SHOULD GO SEE A PICTURE SHOW. IT'D BE A GREAT WAY TO END THE '30s. OH, I CAN THINK OF A THOUSAND BETTER THINGS TO DO. - Margaret: WHAT'S PLAYING? - "GONE WITH THE WIND". I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN. ME TOO. LET'S GET DRESSED UP AND GO. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY MADE THE PICTURE. THE BOOK WAS ATROCIOUS. IF I DON'T LIKE IT, I'M LEAVING. YOU'RE GOING TO WALK OUT OF HERE STUPIDER THAN WHEN YOU WENT IN IF YOU KEEP WATCHING THIS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. YOU LEAVE HALFWAY THROUGH EVERY PICTURE WE SEE. NOW I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. INTERMISSION'S ALMOST OVER. I'M GOING TO WATCH THE REST OF THE PICTURE. YOU DO WHAT YOU PLEASE. SUIT YOURSELF. I'D LIKE A REFUND FOR THIS SILLY PIECE OF HOT AIR THEY'RE CALLING A PICTURE. YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT? DO I SOUND LIKE I LIKED IT? GEE, YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE. WELL, I'M THE FIRST ONE AT A LOT OF THINGS. JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY, PLEASE. MARGARET! I THOUGHT YOU'D COME TO YOUR SENSES. I WANTED TO KEEP YOU COMPANY. WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE HERE. WHAT? "THE YEARLING"! YOU SNEAK. WHEN'D YOU GET THIS? OH, I SUSPECTED WE MIGHT WANT IT. COME ON, WE GOT TWO HOURS. WHERE'S MY GLASSES? I CAN'T STAND THIS BOOK. NOTHING HAPPENS. YOU JUST LEFT A PICTURE WHERE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HAPPENS AND YOU HATE THIS 'CAUSE NOT ENOUGH DOES? WELL WE BOTH KNOW THE DEER DIES. OH, HERE THEY COME. WE CAN GO HOME NOW. THIS IS MY MOTHER, MISS CHARLIE KATE. AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, MARGARET. THIS IS RICHARD. WE MET DURING INTERMISSION. WHERE WERE YOU TWO? FEEDING OUR BRAINS. HELLO. HOW DO YOU DO, MARGARET? PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. MISS CHARLIE KATE. PLEASURE. SOPHIA WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO SIT WITH ME FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PICTURE. DID YOU LIKE IT? OH YES, VERY MUCH. NICE TO MEET YOU. WE'VE GOT TO GO NOW. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU. LOVELY TO MEET YOU, MARGARET. AND YOU, TOO, MISS CHARLIE KATE. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. RICHARD. I DON'T SEE WHAT THERE IS TO BE SO UPSET ABOUT, MOTHER. RICHARD BAINES IS A CHARMING MAN. WELL AT LEAST YOU KNOW HIS LAST NAME. WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? IS HE HIDING OUT FROM SOME WIFE SOMEWHERE? HE'S GONE TO THE MOVIES ALONE, YOU REALIZE. IN THE AFTERNOON. AND HE LIKED IT TO BOOT. IT WAS A WONDER- FUL PICTURE. IF YOU HAD A ROMANTIC BONE IN YOUR BODY YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND. I DON'T NEED A ROMANTIC BONE TO KNOW THAT MEN BRING TROUBLE. ESPECIALLY MEN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. NOW JUST WHAT DOES HE DO FOR A LIVING? YOU SEE? THAT SILENCE TELLS ME YOU DON'T KNOW. THAT IS NOT VERY WISE, SOPHIA. I KNOW THAT I LIKE HIM. I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMETHING EXCITING THAT DOESN'T CONSIST OF THE SICK AND DYING FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE. YOU CLAIM TO KNOW EVERYTHING, MOTHER. WELL IF YOU KNEW YOUR OWN DAUGHTER, YOU MIGHT SEE THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY LONELY. YOU'LL GET OVER THAT. AND I'VE INVITED HIM FOR DINNER, IF YOU CARE TO KNOW. WELL, YOU NEED A TRAFFIC COP IN HERE. ALL RIGHT, SOPHIA. WHY ISN'T HE MARRIED? WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? IF YOU MUST KNOW, HE'S BEEN DIVORCED FOR TWO YEARS. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YESTERDAY. I SPOKE WITH HIM ON THE TELE- PHONE, MISS NOSY. THERE ARE NO SECRETS IN THIS HOUSE. WELL, WHAT IF WE GO TO WAR? HE'S NOT TOO OLD TO SERVE, YOU KNOW. HE HAS FLAT FEET. WELL JUST REMEMBER THAT WE CAN HANG OUR OWN PICTURES AND DO OUR OWN HEAVY LIFTING. WE EVEN TOOK APART A GRAND- FATHER CLOCK. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, MOTHER? THAT A MAN IS COMPLETELY USELESS? Charlie Kate: NO. JUST NOT NECESSARY. AND IF YOU COULD POPULATE THE WORLD, EVERYONE WOULD BE A WOMAN AND BE JUST LIKE YOURSELF. WELL IF I COULD CHANGE YOUR BIRTHDAY, I'D MEET YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 50 WHEN YOU'RE OVER ALL IS FOOLISHNESS. WELL, I AM NOT 50, MOTHER, AND I AM NOT YOU. I HAPPEN TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER WHO IS A DIFFERENT PERSON FROM HER MOTHER ALTOGETHER. AND TONIGHT I AM HAVING DINNER WITH AN EXTREMELY HAND- SOME MAN WHO YOU WOULD GET ALONG WITH JUST FINE IF YOU WOULD GIVE HIM HALF A CHANCE. WELL I WON'T BE HERE TO SEE HIM. I HAVE A BABY TO DELIVER. THAT AWFUL FLOUNDER WOMAN'S HAVING HER SIXTH. WHAT PERFECT TIMING. YOU MUST HAVE PAID HER. HAVE FUN. I WILL. ENTERTAIN HIM. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? Richard: GOOD EVENING, MARGARET. GOOD EVENING, MR. BAINES. OH! THOSE ROSES ARE LOVELY. OH! AND CHOCOLATE- COVERED CHERRIES. MOTHER'S FAVORITE. Richard: WHERE IS THAT LOVELY MOTHER OF YOURS? OH, SHE'S COMING. SHE'LL BE ALONG ANY MINUTE. THANK YOU. YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME YOU'RE ABOUT TO GRADUATE. SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, MARGARET? SOMETHING IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE. AH. TAKING AFTER YOUR GRANDMOTHER. SOMEONE HAS TO. BUT I LOVE IT. SO, WHAT DO YOU DO, MR. BAINES? I PRACTICE LAW. Margaret: A LAWYER. DO YOU LIKE IT? Richard: MOST DAYS, YES I DO. HELLO, MR. BAINES. HELLO. SOPHIA. OH, HOW LOVELY. ARE THESE FOR ME? ABSOLUTELY. WHY THANK YOU. I HOPE MARGARET'S BEEN KEEPING YOU WELL LOOKED AFTER. MARGARET, DARLING, WOULD YOU POUR ME ONE? THANK YOU. I'LL GET DINNER. MARGARET TELLS ME SHE'S GOING INTO MEDICINE. MM. TAKES AFTER MY MOTHER. I CAN'T STOMACH IT MYSELF. THE BLOOD. CAN'T EVEN PULL OUT A SPLINTER. NEITHER CAN I. I'D MUCH RATHER GO TO THE PICTURES. HMM. OR THE THEATRE. - READ A GOOD BOOK. - GET TIPSY. MM. GIGGLE. HOW WAS IT? DEVINE. JUST LIKE THE COMPANY. AW, I KNOW YOU'RE LYING... BUT I'LL ACCEPT THE COMPLIMENT. NO, I'M NOT LYING AT ALL. I DON'T USUALLY COOK. IT WAS DELICIOUS. WE'VE NEVER HAD A MEAL LIKE THIS. WELL, WE'VE NEVER HAD A MAN LIKE THIS. I LIKE HIM. I MORE THAN LIKE HIM. Charlie Kate: YOU GOING TO LET ME IN THE HOUSE? WHERE WERE YOU, HIDING IN THE BUSHES? MR. BAINES IS SO CHARMING. WOULD YOU GET ME MY BRANDY, HONEY? WELL? AREN'T YOU EVEN GOING TO ASK HOW OUR DINNER WAS? I CAN TELL FROM YOUR FLUSHED FACE HOW IT WENT. WHEN'S HE COMING BACK? SATURDAY. HERE YOU GO, GRANDMA. THANK YOU, HONEY. I GOT TO GO TO BED. WHERE'S HE TAKING YOU THIS TIME? UP TO MY UNCLE'S, I GUESS. I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU, DARLING. I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS MORE MEDICAL ATTENTION THAN YOU DO. WE'RE GOING TO HIS MOTHER'S. HE'S PACKING HER UP TO COME LIVE WITH HIM. OH, A MAN THAT LIVES WITH HIS MOTHER. WELL, WHAT A THING TO STRIVE FOR. I LIVE WITH MINE. JUST MY POINT. NOW. YOU TAKE HALF A WINE GLASS FULL EVERY FOUR HOURS, YOU HEAR? THANK YOU, MISS CHARLIE. MM-HM. OH, THAT'S COMING ALONG NICELY. ITALY? YELLOW. THESE ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. ALLIES AND NAZIS. OKAY, I'M GOING TO PUT THIS OVER IN GERMANY. AND ENGLAND. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE OF THOSE, I'M AFRAID. I NEED TO TAKE YOU TO THE MIDDLETON PLANTATION IN CHARLESTON. MM. WHY IS THAT, DARLING? BECAUSE THERE'S A GRAND OAK TREE THERE THAT YOU WOULD LOOK DIVINE STANDING NEXT TO. OH, YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SPOIL ME. WELL YOU SHOULD BE SPOILED. LOOK AT YOU. MM. HE'S SO GIDDY YOU'D THINK HE'S DRUNK. HE'S IN LOVE. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE? IT'S BEEN A YEAR. HAS IT? MOTHER'S IN LOVE WITH HIM, TOO. OH, DON'T TALK SUCH NONSENSE. GRANDMA, THIS ARTICLE SAYS THE TROOPS ARE MASSED ALONG THE RUSSIAN BORDER. THE GERMAN INVASION COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS NEXT MONTH. UH-OH. HAVE YOU TWO HEARD A WORD I'VE SAID? YES, AND IT SOUNDS AS IF HIS MOTHER SHOULD BE ONE OF MY PATIENTS. OH, SHE'S NOT SO BAD. SHE'S JUST PARTIAL TO FERNS. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER. ANGELS HAIR FERN, VERY PRETTY. BOSTON FERN, ALSO VERY PRETTY. LADY FERN ALSO VERY, VERY PRETTY. WHAT'S HER PROBLEM? DEMENTIA? WELL, SHE WAS WALKING AROUND HER NEIGHBORHOOD STEALING PEOPLE'S FERNS AND TALKING TO HERSELF, SO... SOUND LIKE A LUNATIC TO ME. THAT'S INHERITABLE, YOU KNOW. DON'T START, MOTHER. WELL I JUST DON'T TRUST A MAN WHO HAS YOU HELP WITH HIS MOTHER WITHOUT A RING ON YOUR FINGER. I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT I WILL BE MRS. RICHARD BAINES. I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE, MOTHER. YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT. I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING. ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU GIRLS TO BE HAPPY. I HAVE PICTURES TO PROVE I AM. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR MOTHER'S GIRLISHNESS, MARGARET? I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING. Sophia: NOW YOU SHOULD START DATING TOO. BEFORE ALL THE BOYS ARE DEAD OR SNATCHED UP BY OTHER GIRLS. YOU CAN WORK WITH ME AT THE RED CROSS. SHE'S FINE RIGHT WHERE SHE IS. AT LEAST SHE'S FEEDING HER BRAIN. FEEDING IT FOR COLLEGE, I HOPE. I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE WORD ON THAT SUBJECT. YOU'LL HEAR WHEN SHE'S READY. ARE WE FORGETTING WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE IS? DON'T START. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON ANYWAY? SEEMS I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO LIVES IN HER LITERATURE AND A MOTHER WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT ME HELPING WITH HER INVALIDS. I JUST DON'T WANT THIS SILLY ROMANCE OF YOURS TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR WORK. IT'S ALWAYS WORK WITH YOU TWO. CAN'T YOU THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE? WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT? Margaret: KEEP THIS WRAPPED TIGHT. MAKE SURE HE LAYS OFF OF IT. COME BACK AND SEE MISS CHARLIE KATE IN A WEEK. ALL RIGHT? HOW'S THE WIFE, ROY? SHE DEAD YET? GETTING THERE. THEM DROPS YOU GOT HER GOT HER HOLDING ON A LITTLE LONGER.

ARE YOU JUST GOING TO SIT THERE? MOTHER, I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT. THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO THINK ABOUT THAN SEEING YOUR SWEETHEART. YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT TATTOOED. WHEW! OH, GOOD GOD. Charlie Kate: IT SMELLS LIKE SATAN IN HERE! YOU NEED SOME PARENTING LESSONS, YOUNG WOMAN. WHAT KIND OF A HOUSE ARE YOU KEEPING HERE? HELLO THERE, SWEETHEART. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? NOT SO GOOD?

BATHE HER DOWN WITH YOUR HANDS UNTIL SOPHIA FINDS SOMETHING. DID SHE GET HOLD OF ANY MEDICINE, ANY DRUGS? Mother: I DON'T KNOW. Charlie Kate: SHE GOT ANY ALLERGIES? I DON'T KNOW. WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW, WOMAN? DON'T BE PARTICULAR, SOPHIA. JUST GET ANYTHING. WAS THE CHILD BORN BLIND? NO, MA'AM. Charlie Kate: HOW DID SHE GET BLINDED? THE DOCTOR. THE REAL ONE. THE DOCTOR? HE CAUGHT HER COMING OUT AND SORT OF SPILLED SOMETHING ON HER THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE. OH MY GOD. SOPHIA, GET THAT CLOTH. DID HE SAY ANY- THING TO YOU? YES, MA'AM. HE SAID, "DAMN IT ALL TO HELL!" Margaret: IS THIS ALL RIGHT? YES. JUST SOAK IT AND WRAP IT AROUND HER. Margaret: LET'S GET THIS AROUND YOU. IT'S GOING TO FEEL NICE. SHH, SHH. IT'S OKAY. SHH, SHH, SHH. SOPHIA! OH MY GOD. SOPHIA? HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? MOTHER... TELL RICHARD I'M DEAD. I CAN'T GO TO THE PICTURES. DON'T YOU WORRY, HONEY. MARGARET, HAND THE BABY TO HER MOTHER.

IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SHE FEELS YOUR TOUCH. IT'S CATCHING. THIS IS YOUR CHILD, WOMAN. IT SHOULDN'T MATTER IN THE SLIGHTEST IF YOU HAD TO DIE TO SAVE HER. I'LL DO IT. Richard: OH, MY DARLING. YOU LOOK SO PALE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SHE'S THE ONE WHO FAINTED, NOT ME. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US A RIDE. OH, OH, HERE. GIVE IT ALL TO HIM. SHE'S PRICELESS. WELL, YOU BETTER TAKE IT BEFORE HE CHANGES HIS MIND. GOLLY, MISS CHARLIE. HOW CAN I THANK YOU? YOU COULD GIVE ME A RIDE BACK. I DON'T FEEL UP TO DRIVING. YOU'RE GOING BACK RIGHT NOW? YEAH, MR. BAINES HAS GOT HER, AND I GOT TO GET BACK TO THAT BABY. NO TELLING WHAT THAT MOTHER'S DOING. SHOULD I COME WITH YOU? NO, HONEY, YOU STAY HERE FOR YOUR MOTHER. I'LL BE BACK SHORTLY. I GOT EVERY- THING READY. OH, THAT LOOKS NICE. THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? BETTER. HOW'S THE BABY? LIVING. COME ON, RICHARD. UP YOU GO. YOU ALL RIGHT, DARLING? SHE'S JUST FINE. I'M GONNA HAVE A LITTLE BRANDY. COME ON, I'LL POUR ONE FOR YOU. MY MOTHER SEEMS TO HAVE LOST HER REASON. YOU SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. WELL, IF YOU'RE FEELING ALL RIGHT, I WILL. GO ON, DARLING. I'M FINE. SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE WHEN SHE'S NICE. WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO HER? YOU KNOW, MAMA... YOU LOOKED DEAD THERE LYING ON THE FLOOR. AND I THINK SHE REALIZED SHE COULD LOSE YOU. MOTHER, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GOING TO PAY THAT REAL DOCTOR A VISIT. OH-H-H-H! NOT WITHOUT ME, YOU'RE NOT. MARGARET? THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE WORKING. Sophia: I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD. WELL WHAT'S GOING ON? SHE'S GOING TO SEE THE REAL DOCTOR. NOT WITHOUT ME, SHE'S NOT. WELL COME ON, THEN. TELL THAT IMBECILE THAT MISS CHARLIE KATE WOULD LIKE A WORD WITH HIM. HE'S WITH A PATIENT RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU ILL? NO, BUT HE'S GOING TO BE IF HE DOESN'T GET OUT HERE. MISS? IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO COVER YOUR HEAD, YOU GET A HOT ONION AND YOU HOLD IT TO IT. AND KEEP HOLDING IT TO IT. THAT LOOKS FIERCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS HOODLUM'S BEEN DOING TO YOU. WHO ARE YOU CALLING A HOODLUM? YOU! YOU ARE A MISERABLE, DRUNKEN THUG. AND A COWARD TO BOOT. YOU OUGHT TO BE RUN OUT OF TOWN. YOU COULD KINDLY LOWER YOUR VOICE IN MY OFFICE, CHARLIE. THAT'S MISS CHARLIE KATE TO YOU AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES. I'M FAR TOO TIRED FROM SITTING UP ALL NIGHT WITH THAT CHILD THAT YOU BLINDED. YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE. THAT NONSENSE HAS A NAME, DOCTOR. MEREDITH BARNES. THE CHILD YOU BLINDED AT BIRTH. AND WHO HAS NOW LIVED NOT TO SEE HER THIRD BIRTHDAY. CALL THE POLICE. I'M A POLICE OFFICER. WELL, ARREST THIS WOMAN. WELL, SHE'S SAYING YOU BLINDED A BABY. I DID NO SUCH THING! SHE WORKS WITH HERBS. WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR? ARTHRITIS. HE GIVE YOU THIS? YES. THIS CAUSES CHEST PAIN AND HAIR LOSS. YOU NEED TO RECTIFY SOME OF THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE, DOCTOR. YOU CAN START BY GIVING YOUR WRITTEN PERMISSION FOR MY PATIENTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR PRE- SCRIPTIONS TO THE HAYES PHARMACY, SEEING AS HOW I WRITE THE ACCURATE ONES. YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. IF I HAD MY WAY, I'D HAVE YOU SHOT. Patients: LET'S GO, GIRLS. IS THIS REALLY FOR ARTHRITIS? OH, GO CLIMB A HILL. MISS CHARLIE? SHE CAUGHT ALL THREE OF MY BABIES FOR FREE. GOT RID OF MY BED FLEAS. CURED ME OF A FLAKY HEAD FOR TEN CENTS. TEN CENTS. YOU DON'T SAY. MM-HMM. "MISS CHARLIE KATE'S FATHER SHOT HIMSELF AFTER HIS WIFE GAVE BIRTH TO TWIN BABY GIRLS. SHE WAS RAISED BY HER MOTHER..." I KNOW ABOUT THAT. WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE DOCTOR? SO FOR THOSE OF YOU IN NEED OF A DOCTOR, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE REAL ONE: MISS CHARLIE KATE ON THE HILL ABOVE BERRY STREET. YOU CAN TELL HER HOUSE BY THE LINES OF PEOPLE WAITING TO BE HEALED. WHO WROTE THAT? MRS. ANNA HAWKINS. YOU HAVE A FAN. IF SHE'S SUCH A FAN, YOU'D THINK SHE'D BE ONE OF MY PATIENTS. HOW DOES SHE KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ME? ALL THAT GANG OF YOURS OUT THERE, I'M SURE. POSTMAN JUST DELIVERED SOME MORE POSSIBILITIES. BRYN MAWR, RADCLIFFE... GOUCHER. WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO ATTEND? WITH YOUR GRADES AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE VALEDICTORIAN, YOU CAN PROBABLY HAVE YOUR PICK. I'M NOT SURE IF I EVEN WANT TO GO. DON'T BE SILLY. PICK AT LEAST ONE. IF I HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION TODAY, I'D STAY AT HOME AND NOT GO AT ALL. MARGARET, YOU CANNOT JUST STAY AT HOME. I AM LIKE MY MOTHER IN ONE SENSE IN THAT I BELIEVE YOU DON'T HAVE A LIFE WITHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND YOU HAVE NO BRAIN UNLESS YOU USE IT. WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO GO? I DON'T KNOW. I... I JUST DON'T. BUT I DON'T SEE WHY I HAVE TO. MARGARET, YOU HAVE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. MOTHER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING. "DEAR MISS CHARLIE KATE, I DON'T KNOW HOW EVER TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY EDUCATION POSSIBLE. YOU WERE RIGHT. WHAT A FINE THING IT IS FINALLY NOT TO BE THE ONLY ONE, BUT ONE OF MANY. SINCERELY, CHARLES NUTTER." THERE YOU GO BRINGING CHARLES NUTTER INTO THIS. CHARLES NUTTER. THAT'S THE... THAT'S THE MAN YOUR MOTHER SHOULD HAVE MARRIED. ACCORDING TO HER. HE WAS HAND-PICKED. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT I THOUGHT. WELL WHAT DID YOU KNOW? YOU ONLY LIKED THE IDIOTS. I DIDN'T PUT HIM THROUGH SCHOOL FOR MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT. NOW, MARGARET, IF YOU GO TO COLLEGE, YOU'LL BE EXPOSED TO A GREAT MANY GIRLS JUST LIKE YOURSELF. AND THAT CAN BE VERY ENJOYABLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU GO SOMEPLACE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, YOU'LL BE MISERABLE, YOU WON'T LEARN A DROP. HER STUBBORN NATURE WILL SURELY TAKE OVER IN YOU. YOU'D JUST BE WASTING OUR MONEY. I UNDERSTAND YOU TWO ARE IN CAHOOTS. FINE. GO AHEAD. STAY AT YOUR GRAND- MOTHER'S FEET WHILE ALL THE OTHER GIRLS SNATCH UP THE DECENT MEN AND LEAVE YOU IN THE TRENCHES. WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH COLLEGE? WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO MEET A MAN? WELL, SHE'S ABOUT TO GRADUATE AND HASN'T GONE ON ONE DATE. DOESN'T EVEN OWN A DECENT PARTY DRESS AND THE ONLY PHONE CALLS SHE GETS ARE FROM THAT SCHOOL NURSE ASKING HER MEDICAL QUESTIONS. Charlie Kate: SHE KNOWS MORE THAN THAT SCHOOL NURSE WITH HER HANDS TIED BEHIND HER. NOW MARGARET WILL MEET THE MAN FOR HER WHEN SHE NEEDS TO. I DON'T KNOW HOW. Sophia: WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO WORK ON MY SPEECH. I'M VALEDICTORIAN, REMEMBER? AND NO, I DON'T HAVE A DRESS OR A DATE FOR THE OCCASION. SOPHIA, SHE'S NOT A LITTLE GIRL ANY MORE. SHE CAN MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS. YOU DIDN'T LET ME MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS. WELL, YOU NEVER MADE THE RIGHT ONES. HOW'S YOUR SPEECH COMING? UM, IT IS WHAT IT IS. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? CIAFFA'S DRESS SHOP. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT. DO YOU LIKE IT? UH, I LOVE IT! THANK YOU. MM. TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE TO GO WITH IT. HOGWASH. DON'T YOU LET ANY OF THAT NONSENSE TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR DAY. HERE. YOU CAN GIVE THAT BACK TO ME AFTER YOU GRADUATE. OH, MY GOSH. WELL... IS YOUR CONSCIENCE FINALLY SPEAKING TO YOU? IT WAS SILVER NITRATE, MISS CHARLIE KATE. I-I'M AN IMBECILE. I SPILLED SILVER NITRATE IN THAT POOR BABY'S EYES. COME ON. Charlie Kate: ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING ABOUT IT? WELL, I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS FOR SO LONG THAT... I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU. I'M NOT THE ONE THAT NEEDS HELP AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIVING WITH MANY MORE FAILINGS IF YOU KEEP THAT UP. I'M SO SORRY, BUT THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO DO. I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LISTEN. ANYTHING. ENROLL MEREDITH IN THE MOOREHEAD SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. SEE TO IT THAT HER MOTHER IS SET UP WITH AN ACCOUNT AT THE NEAREST GENERAL STORE TO BE PAID BY YOU INDEFINITELY. THAT OUGHT TO KEEP YOU BUSY. I'VE... I'VE ALREADY SENT WORD TO THE HAYES PHARMACY. YOU CAN GET YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED. GOOD. I GUESS YOU'LL NEED IT WITH ALL THESE PATIENTS. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE I HAVE ANY LEFT. DO YOU MIND SO MUCH IF I... I JUST, UH, RESTED HERE A MINUTE? TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS SUDDENLY AND DELIBERATELY ATTACKED BY NAVAL AND AIR FORCES OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN. THE UNITED STATES WAS AT PEACE WITH THAT NATION AND, AT THE SOLICITATION... CAN'T WE TURN THAT OFF? SOPHIA. I'VE BEEN FIGHTING WITH THOSE IGNORANT JUNIOR-LEAGUERS ALL DAY TRYING TO GET MY BANDAGE QUOTA FILLED. ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE TO THINK OF BUT WAR? I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY FIT THING TO THINK ABOUT NOW THAT WE'RE IN IT. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO TO THE PICTURES OR SOMETHING. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T MISS "CITIZEN KANE." AND, MARGARET, I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT EVERY GIRL YOUR AGE IS EITHER MARRIED OR JUST MARRIED OR AT LEAST LOOKING TO BE MARRIED. YOU'RE MISSING ALL THE MEN COOPING YOURSELF UP IN HERE ALL DAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE FACT THAT RICHARD HASN'T PROPOSED YET OUT ON MARGARET. OH, DON'T BRING IT UP. IT'S WORRYING ME TO TEARS. I'M SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING HE SAYS. DON'T WAIT UP. DON'T WORRY. MARGARET, TURN THAT RADIO BACK ON. GENERAL LEE WOULD'VE TAKEN CARE OF THIS BY NOW. YES, I KNOW WHERE THAT IS. ALL RIGHT. GOODBYE. MORNING. GOOD MORNING. HE POSE ANY QUESTIONS LAST NIGHT? OH, DON'T MAKE ME CRY, MOTHER. IT'S TOO EARLY. WHO WAS THAT ON THE PHONE? THAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PERSON, CHARLES NUTTER. OH, BROTHER. DOCTOR CHARLES NUTTER. HE'S BEEN APPOINTED ADMINISTRATOR OF THE VETERANS HOSPITAL HERE IN WAKE COUNTY. HOW NICE. HE'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU PLANNED FOR HIM TO BE. I DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING I PLANNED FOR. HE'S MARRIED. MARRIED TO A TEACHER. SHE'S HELPING HIM OUT DOWN THERE AT THE HOSPITAL. SO SHOULD YOU. MIGHT GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DO BESIDES WORRY ABOUT THE WAR. I MIGHT DO THAT. Margaret: MORNING. MORNING, HONEY. YOU MIGHT DO WHAT? VOLUNTEER AT CHARLES NUTTER'S HOSPITAL. HE PROMISED ME A C GASOLINE CARD IF I DO IT. MOMMA, SENATOR'S WIVES ARE SCRATCHING EACH OTHERS EYES OUT OVER C CARDS. YOU SHOULD TAKE IT! WELL, IF YOU INSIST, I'LL CALL HIM. Margaret: YOU'RE GOING TO VOLUNTEER? MM-HMM. SO ARE YOU. I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING TO BRING MY GRANDDAUGHTER WITH ME. YOU KNOW, IT GIVES US SOMETHING TO DO. YOU ARE SUCH A SNEAK. WELL, I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF SOMEHOW. HE'S ASSIGNING YOU TO READ AND WRITE FOR THE MEN WHO ARE UNABLE TO DO SO FOR WHAT- EVER REASON. MAYBE YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE. THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE GOING. WANT SOME GARLIC TOAST? THAT'S HIM. WELL, WHY DIDN'T MOTHER LIKE HIM? BECAUSE HE WAS WONDERFUL. CHARLES. MISS CHARLIE KATE. HOW GRAND! OH, DON'T BE SLOBBERING OVER ME. THIS IS MY GRAND- DAUGHTER, MARGARET. HELLO, MARGARET. I'VE HEARD SUCH AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT YOU FROM MISS CHARLIE KATE'S LETTERS. HOW DO YOU DO? PERFECTLY WELL NOW THAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE HERE. PARDON ME FOR JUST A MINUTE. Charlie Kate: WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M DEVASTATED HE'S NOT MY FATHER. MM-HM. MISS CHARLIE KATE, MARGARET, THIS IS MY WIFE, LOUISE. HELLO, LOUISE. MISS CHARLIE KATE, MARGARET. HELLO. YOU'VE GOT A FINE MAN HERE. ALL THANKS TO YOU. OH, NONSENSE. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU ALL SO HAPPY. MARGARET, ARE YOU READY? SHALL I TAKE YOUR COAT TO MY OFFICE? OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS CHARLIE KATE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET SOMEONE. YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S A SPLENDID WOMAN. YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE. Margaret: DO THEY ALWAYS... OH. YOU'LL GET USED TO IT. JUST KEEP IN MIND, THEY'VE ALL HAD LIMITED EXPOSURE TO WOMEN. IT'S BEST NOT TO GET TOO INVOLVED IN THEIR AFFAIRS. SOME OF OUR VOLUNTEERS HAVE GONE... WELL, OVERBOARD IN THEIR ATTENTIONS. UH, WE'RE STARTING OUT WITH JUST A FEW TODAY TO GET YOU COMFORTABLE. NEXT ONE'S ROOM 233. YOU'LL FIND ALL THEIR INFORMATION ON THEIR CARDS. I SEE YOU'RE PREPARED. IF YOU NEED MORE PAPER OR PENCILS THEY'RE IN EACH NIGHT STAND DRAWER. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MARGARET... JUST READ THE GODDAMN LETTER. YOU CAN WATCH YOUR TONE WITH ME. JUST READ THE GODDAMN LETTER. "DEAR TAD, I WANTED TO DROP YOU A NOTE TO TELL YOU THAT I JUST DON'T THINK..." READ IT! "I JUST DON'T THINK I SHOULD CONTINUE TO WAIT. I'M NOT GOING TO BE 18 FOREVER AND YOU KNOW HOW FULL OF FUN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN. EVERYONE AT WOOLWORTH'S SAYS SO. PLEASE DON'T THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR INJURIES. I'LL SEND BACK THE FRIENDSHIP BRACELET AS SOON AS I CAN FIND A BOX FOR IT. SINCERELY, ARLENE." GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. OOH! Sophia: WAS HE A NICE YOUNG MAN? NOT PARTICULARLY. WELL, NOT UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. DID YOU GIVE HIM YOUR NAME AT LEAST? MOTHER... I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY TO THIS GIRL. DEAR ARLENE, IT IS A SORRY GIRL WHO SPITS ON ONE FALLEN. THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WILL BE HOPELESS. WORTHLESS. LIKE YOURSELF. HMM. MAY YOUR CHILDREN INHERIT YOUR HUSBAND'S SCOLIOSIS, HIS CLUB FEET, RECESSED TESTICLES OR WHATEVER ELSE IT WAS THAT KEPT HIM OUT OF THE FIGHTING. AS FOR THE BRACELET... HOLD ON, HOLD ON. WAIT A MINUTE. THROW OFF THE FIRST BRIDGE YOU COME TO. AS FOR MY HANDS AND ARMS, I'M GLAD THEY'RE NOT AROUND YOU. THANKS FOR NOTHING. TAD. ALL RIGHT, WHO'S NEXT? LET'S DO MISSISSIPPI. AH, THE ONE WHO THINKS FAULKNER IS THE SPAWN OF SATAN? UH-OH. IT'S THE POSTMAN COME TO ARREST US. DON'T BE SILLY. IT'S JUST RICHARD. WOULD YOU GET THE DOOR, MARGARET? RICHARD? IN THIS STORM? THE BRIDGE WILL FLOOD. HE'LL NEVER GET OUT OF HERE. MM. HOW WAS THAT AWFUL GUEST BED, DARLING? YOU OUGHTA ACT IN THOSE PICTURES YOU SEE. YOU READY, DARLING? MM. READY FOR WHAT? WE'VE DECIDED WE'RE BORED. WE'RE GOING TO THE WOODS. THE WOODS? YOU'LL FREEZE TO DEATH. OH, I DON'T THINK SO. I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE. WE'LL TAKE OUR CHANCES. MAYBE HE'S GONNA PROPOSE. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. GET YOUR COAT. THIS DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD. Margaret: WHAT? YEAH, COME ON. ALL RIGHT. I LOVE IT! Margaret: I'VE NEVER SEEN HER THAT HAPPY. COME ON, LET'S LEAVE 'EM ALONE. MAYBE WE'LL SET OUT SOME BRANDY AND CAKES. OKAY. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ASLEEP AT THIS HOUR. MR. TOM HAWKINS THE THIRD. I'LL JUST WAIT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? WHY'S HE STILL SLEEPING? I DON'T KNOW. THOMAS HAWKINS THE THIRD. WELL, THIRD OR NOT, HE STILL NEEDS TO GET UP. WELL, LET'S LEAVE HIM ALONE IF HE'S SO TIRED. WAKE UP, SON. STAY UP ALL NIGHT, SLEEP ALL DAY, HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET WELL? WHAT TIME IS IT? TIME FOR YOU TO BE AWAKE. COULD YOU GET ME SOME ORANGE JUICE AND DRY TOAST? THAT WOULD BE SWELL OF YOU. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO BE SWELL. WILL YOU DO IT FOR ME, THEN? SHE DIDN'T COME HERE TO BE SWELL EITHER. WAKE UP, WRITE YOUR MOTHER. THAT'D BE SWELL. SHE JUST LIVES ACROSS TOWN. A BOY SHOULD WRITE HIS MOTHER, EVEN IF SHE LIVES NEXT DOOR. WHY DON'T YOU WRITE MY MOTHER, THEN? I'LL DO IT IF IT'LL GET YOU UP. I'LL TELL HER HER SON'S LAZING AROUND A VETERAN'S HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF GETTING UP, TRYING TO EXERCISE. WELL, GO ON, DO IT. TELL HER TOM'S ASSING OFF AGAIN, SEND IT TO ANNA HAWKINS, CARE OF THE "HERALD". THAT'S JUST WHAT I'LL DO. WHERE DID SHE GO? PROBABLY TO GET AN EXTRA CHAIR SO SHE'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE. DO ALL THESE HACKING PATIENTS PUT YOU IN THE MIND OF HANS CASTORP? "MAGIC MOUNTAIN" IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT I'D CALL LIGHT READING TO RECUPERATE BY. WELL, HAVE YOU READ IT? UH, NOT IN GERMAN. WHO ARE YOU TWO? OH, I'M MARGARET AND THAT WAS MY GRAND- MOTHER YOU JUST MET, MISS CHARLIE KATE. AH. WELL THAT'S JUST SWELL. MY MOTHER'S HERO HERE TO TORTURE ME. YOUR MOTHER'S HERO? WELL, MISS CHARLIE KATE SCORED ALL SORTS OF POINTS WITH MY MOTHER. FIRST, HAVING THAT SEWER SYSTEM PUT IN. THEN PUTTING OUR NEIGHBOR, THAT DOCTOR, OUT OF BUSINESS. HE WAS YOUR NEIGHBOR? IT'S ALL SHE EVER TALKS ABOUT. HOW'D YOUR MOTHER KNOW ABOUT SUCH THINGS? SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING. SHE WRITES FOR THE NEWSPAPER. SHE'S WRITTEN PIECES ON YOU. OH, YOU SHOULD WRITE THAT IN THE LETTER, THAT WE MET. MAYBE SHE'LL LOOSEN UP ON ME A BIT. ALL RIGHT, START TALKING. DON'T WORRY THAT MARGARET CAN'T KEEP UP. SHE'LL GET THE GIST OF IT, AND SHE'LL TYPE IT UP LATER. I THOUGHT YOU WERE WRITING IT. MARGARET WILL DO JUST FINE. START TALKING. WELL... DEAR MOM. GUESS WHO'S WRITING THIS LETTER FOR ME? MISS CHARLIE KATE'S GRANDDAUGHTER. THE DOCTOR HERSELF WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE. SHE SEEMS VERY MEAN. YOU TWO WOULD REALLY GET ALONG SWELL. WELL, HER GRAND- DAUGHTER DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THAT MEAN, THOUGH SHE DID SIT HERE AND STARE A HOLE THROUGH ME WHILE MY EYES WERE CLOSED. WHICH I DIDN'T MIND SO MUCH. I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'D BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A LITTLE MORPHINE RIGHT NOW. MY BACK HURTS LIKE THE DEVIL. I WOULDN'T MIND SOME OF THOSE OATMEAL COOKIES TOO. LOVE YOUR SON, TOM. THERE. HOW WAS THAT? SATISFACTORY. WELL, THANK YOU. NOW I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD TALK TO YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER PRIVATELY? I'M NOT A FAN OF PRIVACY. I DESPISE NOT KNOWING WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING. ALL RIGHT, THEN. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER IF I COULD GIVE HER A CALL SOMETIME. THAT'D BE FINE. ANY TIME BEFORE 10:00 O'CLOCK. IF SOMEBODY CALLS AFTER 10:00 O'CLOCK, I THINK SOMEONE'S DEAD IN A DITCH. WE'RE IN THE BOOK. COME ON, MARGARET. GOODBYE, MARGARET. BYE. YOU KNOW, MARGARET, THAT BOY IS INTELLIGENT. YOU CAN SEE HE'S NOT IMPRESSED WITH HIS OWN GOOD LOOKS. AND HE'S PROBABLY TIRED OF THOSE GIDDY-TYPE GIRLS AT THE COUNTRY CLUB. BUT HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU STARING AT HIM. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST YANK ME AWAY FROM HIM LIKE YOU DID MOTHER FROM MR. BAINES? WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT MR. BAINES WHEN SOPHIE MET HIM, 'CEPT SHE WAS JUST SLOBBERING ALL OVER HIM. COME ON, LET'S SIT DOWN A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT HER JUDGMENT. BUT I KNOW EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE HAWKINS BOY. HE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE. NO, NOT SINCE SATAN TACKLED EVE HAS ANYBODY GONE AFTER SOMEBODY AS HARD AS HE'S GONNA GO AFTER YOU. YOU'RE GONNA MARRY THAT BOY, MARK MY WORDS. DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS ALL THIS? WELL, HE MAY NOT KNOW ALL OF IT, BUT HE KNOWS ENOUGH. I BET HE RINGS YOU TONIGHT. WELL, I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL MOTHER. OH, I'D KEEP SILENT ABOUT THIS. I THINK IT'D KILL HER IF YOU GOT ENGAGED BEFORE SHE DID. OKAY. "EYES WATCHED TIRES, EARS LISTENED TO CLATTERING MOTORS, AND MINDS STRUGGLED WITH OIL, WITH GASOLINE, WITH THE THINNING RUBBER BETWEEN AIR AND ROAD. A BROKEN GEAR WAS A TRAGEDY." LORD, HE CAN WRITE. IF A MAN COULD TALK TO ME LIKE STEINBECK WRITES... YOU'D TELL HIM TO STUFF A SOCK IN IT. PROBABLY. RICHARD NEVER CALLS AT THIS HOUR. I'LL GET IT. HELLO? Tom: Is this the lovely granddaughter? OH, WHAT'S HER NAME? AH, YES. MARGARET. HI. CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING OUT OF BED. WELL I CREDIT MY RISE TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER. YOU TELL HER SHE DID A SWELL JOB. I WILL. So when you coming back to see me? I HAVE THIS UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO DICTATE MANY MORE LETTERS. I'LL BE, UM, I'LL BE SERVING PUNCH AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT. WELL, THAT'S JUST SWELL. MAYBE I CAN DANCE WITH YOU, if you don't touch me too hard. MAYBE. THANK YOU FOR CALLING. WHO IS THAT SHE'S TALKING TO? IS THAT NURSE STILL CALLING HER WITH QUESTIONS? WAS THAT THE SCHOOL NURSE? JUST SOME CONCERNS ABOUT MEDICATION. OH, AT THIS HOUR. YOU'D THINK SOMEONE FELL IN A DITCH. ALL RIGHT. WHERE WERE WE? HELLO, YOU TWO. HELLO, LOUISE. ARE WE TOO LATE FOR OUR PUNCH DUTY? OH, NO. NO, TAKE YOUR TIME. ENJOY YOURSELVES. HOW'S THE HAWKINS BOY? OH, MUCH BETTER. HE'S SURE TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE. I CAUGHT HIM EARLIER TRYING TO BRIBE AN ORDERLY TO HAVE THE LAUNDRY PRESS HIS DRESS UNIFORM. JUST LIKE HIM. I'M GONNA SERVE PUNCH. LOUISE, ALL DONE. OH. EXCUSE ME. SURE. EXCUSE ME. HELLO, MS. CHARLIE KATE. DR. TRIMBLE. YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT JUST LAST WEEK THERE WAS A MAN OUT IN CALIFORNIA ARRESTED FOR OPERATING ON PEOPLE WITHOUT A LICENSE. IF YOU INTEND THAT AS A MORAL LESSON FOR ME, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH. NO, I JUST MENTIONED IT TO BE HUMOROUS. CHARLIE. GOOD EVENING, MISS CHARLIE KATE. TWO, PLEASE. WELL, GOD, DON'T YOU LOOK BORED. I'M NOT BORED. HI, MARGARET. HI. ARE YOU READY FOR A DANCE? WELL, I CAN'T. I HAVE TO SERVE PUNCH. I... I'LL TAKE OVER HERE. EVENING, MISS CHARLIE. TOM. THANK YOU. ARE YOU SURE YOUR BACK'S FINE? WELL, DON'T IT LOOK ALL RIGHT? I THINK I LOOK KIND OF DIGNIFIED LIKE THIS. YES, YOU DO ACTUALLY. OH, I'M SORRY. IT STILL MUST BE A LITTLE TENDER. WHY DON'T WE STOP FOR A WHILE? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT FOR A SLOW ONE. OR DO YOU WANT TO QUIT? NO. KEEP GOING. BUT ARE YOU SURE? YEAH. SO HOW COME YOU'RE NOT IN COLLEGE? I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HOME. EVERYBODY'S GOT TO LEAVE HOME SOME TIME. DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS... DO YOU THINK THAT... I'M SORRY. WHAT NEWS? ABOUT MY DISCHARGE. I'VE GOT TWO DAYS LEFT. REALLY? MY MEDICAL EVALUATIONS CAME THROUGH THIS MORNING. I STILL HAVE SOME SHRAPNEL LODGED IN MY BACK, SO I'M NOT GOING BACK TO ACTIVE DUTY. BUT I'M GOING TO ASHEVILLE FOR A WHILE. I'M STAYING AT THE GROVE PARK INN, WHERE SOME GERMAN PRISONERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. I'M REPLACING THE TRANSLATOR THERE FOR THREE WEEKS. HOW DID YOU BECOME SO PRO- FICIENT IN GERMAN? WHY, I STUDIED LANGUAGES AT WASHINGTON AND LEE. BUT I'M COMING BACK TO TOWN TO WORK IN THE RECRUITMENT CENTRE. GREAT. WHAT ABOUT YOU, MARGARET? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS? WELL, I'M GOING TO SIT AT HOME AND READ. AND PLOT TROOP MOVEMENTS. WRITE LETTERS FOR PATIENTS. HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL BREAK A LEG OR SOMETHING TO GIVE MY GRAND- MOTHER AND ME SOME EXCITEMENT. YOU LEFT OUT WRITING ME. AND I'LL WRITE YOU. OH, MY LORD. THE HEAD'S BEEN IN A BUCKET IN THE CELLAR THE WHOLE TIME. HUH. OH, IT SEEMS LIKE A BOY I DELIVERED GETS KILLED EVERY DAY. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SOME OF THEM WERE GROWN UP. I'M JUST THANKFUL FOR RICHARD'S FLAT FEET. MM-HMM. EXCUSE ME. I THINK IT'S A HARD THING FOR HER, WRITING FOR ALL THESE BOYS. MM. Tom: DEAR MARGARET, MY PARENTS ARE GIVING A DINNER PARTY, AND I HESITATE TO ASK THIS BECAUSE IT MAY SOUND LIKE I'M USING YOU TO GET TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER, BUT IF SHE COULD COME, THAT WOULD BE SWELL. I SUSPECT MY MOTHER'S ONLY THROWING THE PARTY TO MEET HER ANYWAY. OH, AND BY THE WAY, MY DAD OWNS CIAFFA'S DRESS SHOP. DON'T LET ME INSULT YOU BY SOUNDING CHEAP, BUT YOU CAN GET A HUGE DISCOUNT ON ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE. WELL, YOU'D BETTER GET SOME REST, MARGARET, BECAUSE WHEN I GET BACK FROM ASHEVILLE, I HAVE PLANS FOR YOU. BEST WISHES ALWAYS, TOM HAWKINS III. Charlie Kate: WELL? HERE, LET ME READ. I DON'T THINK I CAN WAIT THREE WEEKS. BETTER THAN A LIFETIME. Margaret: ALL OF ME WANTED TO JUMP ON THE NEXT TRAIN TO ASHEVILLE. BUT I DID WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER DID, AND WHAT HER MOTHER DID BEFORE HER. I CONTINUED TO WORK. BEING IN LOVE MADE WORK SOMEHOW SWEETER. WELL, SOPHIA! DID YOU LEAVE ANYTHING FOR US TO DO? OH, I COULDN'T WAIT. I-I HAD TO BE BUSY DOING SOMETHING. I FINISHED ALL THE CHRISTMAS CARDS, TOO. THIS ONE ALWAYS GOES ON THE RIGHT SIDE. OH, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING YOUR OWN WAY, DON'T YOU? FROM SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES TO RE-ORGANIZING A DAMN CHRISTMAS TREE. THERE. Sophia: THE TWO OF YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I FIT ANY MORE. MARGARET, WHO ARE YOU WRITING TO? OH, UM, JUST TO ONE OF THE PATIENTS. DON'T YOU TYPE THEM? NOT ALWAYS. YOU SEEM SO DISTRACTED. WHAT IS GOING ON? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GET NO SLEEP, THE TWO OF YOU ARE CONSTANTLY WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER. YOU BOUGHT NEW CLOTHES, YOU'RE DOING YOUR HAIR. IS THIS ABOUT THE SCHOOLS? ARE YOU TWO IN CAHOOTS ABOUT THE SCHOOLS? I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF ADVISING HER ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE TO GO. OH, DON'T GET YOUR KNICKERS IN A TWIST, SOPHIA. CHRISTMAS IS A PERFECT TIME TO RECEIVE A PROPOSAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. HOW SHOULD I SIGN IT? WHAT NUMBER IS IT? THE SEVENTH. "YOUR FRIEND." "MRS. HILLHOPPER SHOT HER HUSBAND YESTERDAY FOR DEALING HER A BAD BRIDGE HAND." "CHURCHILL CALLS MUSSOLINI A HYENA. MUSSOLINI CALLS HIM ONE BACK." ARE YOU TWO GOING TO HELP ME WRAP PRESENTS OR JUST SIT THERE? YOU'RE A HYENA. WELL SO ARE YOU! SANTA WANTS YOU TO COME INTO MY ROOM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE IT. I'VE KNOWN ABOUT SANTA FOR YEARS. WELL, HE'S STILL COMING, ISN'T HE? WHEN'S RICHARD GETTING HERE? IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. HE'S GETTING HIS MOTHER. BETTER WATER THE FERNS. HELLO? OH, HI. WHAT? Y-YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHISPER. AR... ARE YOU SURE? WHAT DID SHE SAY? I-I DON'T KNOW, BUT THANK YOU FOR CALLING. AND I'M SURE YOU'LL KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. I THINK THIS WOULD BE LOVELY ON HER. UH-HUH. MARGARET! NO PEEKING. WE HAVE TO GET ALL THIS FINISHED BEFORE RICHARD GETS HERE. Charlie Kate: OH, RICHARD THIS, RICHARD THAT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE LADY DOWN AT THE SIR WALTER HOTEL JUST CALLED. WHAT? WELL, SHE CALLED AND... MARGARET, GET YOURSELF TOGETHER AND TELL US WHAT'S THE MATTER OR COME BACK WHEN YOU CAN. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A LADY THERE WHO'S CALLING HERSELF MRS. RICHARD BAINES. SHE CHECKED IN TODAY AND SHE'S PLANNING ON STAYING FOR TWO WEEKS. HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? WATCH YOUR STEP NOW, MOTHER. YES. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU. AND TO THE OTHER ONE YOU'VE GOT STASHED AT THE SIR WALTER. WHAT? WAIT FOR ME IN THE KITCHEN WHILE I GET YOUR MOTHER SITUATED. IN THE KITCHEN. I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU, MRS. BAINES. I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME VISIT US. OF COURSE YOU ARE. I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE YOU RIGHT IN HERE. MARGARET? COME ON DOWN, HELP ME. I'M PUTTING YOU IN MY FAVORITE CHAIR. Mrs. Baines: AH, HOW NICE. I'LL HANG UP YOUR COAT FOR YOU. THANK YOU. OH, MARGARET. MRS. BAINES, THIS IS MARGARET. THIS IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER. HELLO, NICE TO MEET YOU. OH, IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU. SHE'S GOING TO DRAG OVER THAT FERN BY YOU. OH, GOOD. YOU ENJOY YOURSELF. THANK YOU. WELL... HERE YOU GO. IT'S SO HEALTHY. IT'S JUST FLOURISHING. WHAT DID YOU MEAN ABOUT THE SIR WALTER? WHO'S STAYING THERE? YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S AT THE HOTEL? NO, BUT I BELIEVE YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME. SOPHIA? COME TELL MR. BAINES WHO'S AT THE HOTEL. Charlie Kate: COME ON, SOPHIA, TELL HIM. MRS. RICHARD BAINES. SHE'S PLANNING TO STAY FOR TWO WEEKS. WE'RE DIVORCED, SOPHIA. YOU KNOW THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS HERE. HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW? I HAD NO IDEA. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. NO WOMAN WOULD SHOW UP ON CHRISTMAS EVE FLAGGING HER EX-HUSBAND'S NAME AROUND WITHOUT HIM KNOWING. YES, SHE WOULD. SHE'S BEEN HAVING SOME PROBLEMS LATELY. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? BECAUSE I SPOKE TO HER RECENTLY. I DIDN'T INVITE HER HERE. NOW, SHE CALLED ME. AFTER SHE RECEIVED NEWS OF HER BROTHER'S DEATH IN ITALY, SHE WAS VERY UPSET. HER FATHER DIED EARLY IN THE YEAR. HER MOTHER DIED THE YEAR BEFORE. THIS WAS HER FIRST CHRISTMAS ALONE. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE WOULD COME HERE. CAN I TALK TO SOPHIA ALONE? THERE IS NO ALONE IN THIS HOUSE. I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN THINGS. MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO THE HOTEL OR CALL? I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH HER? SOPHIA, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. I... YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S BEING RIDICULOUS. JUST TELL ME THIS. DO YOU WANT SOPHIA OR DON'T YOU? WITH ALL MY HEART. I WAS PLANNING... THAT SETTLES IT, THEN. IT'S AGAINST THE RULES TO HAVE TWO. GO START THE CAR AND I'LL GO GET MY COAT. WHERE ARE WE GOING? TO THE HOTEL. I'LL SIT IN THE CAR WHILE YOU GO UP AND SEND THAT WOMAN BACK WHERE SHE BELONGS. BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS. DO YOU REALIZE WHAT GALL IT TAKES FOR A WOMAN TO DO THIS? I WOULDN'T EVEN DO THAT. THIS WOMAN IS TRYING TO GET YOU BACK AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT REMARRIED JUST MAKES IT WORSE. NO. NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. OH, I WANT TO. I'VE FINISH THINGS OFF MYSELF AT THE SIR WALTER. I WANT SOME COOKIES. WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY. WELL, IF YOU INTEND FOR ME TO STAY HERE, YOU BETTER FIND ME SOME COOKIES. EXCUSE ME. OH. SOPHIA! WHAT HAPPENED? WE'LL FIND OUT. STOP THAT, DO YOUR OWN. YOURS IS BETTER. THAT'S BECAUSE I'M AN ARTISTE. I'M MAKING A FERN HERE. WELL? RICHARD AND I ARE DRIVING TO SOUTH CAROLINA TONIGHT TO BE MARRIED. THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE COAST FOR A WEEK. THERE'S NOTHING TO DO THERE IN THE WINTER, BUT WE'RE GOING ANYWAY. WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS? WE DECIDED TOGETHER. I WAS PLANNING ON PROPOSING IN THE MORNING AND THEN HAVING THE SERVICE IN THE SPRING, BUT WE DECIDED IT WAS BEST TO GO AHEAD NOW.

YOU SHOULD LET MISS CHARLIE KATE DO THE CARVING, DARLING. I SUSPECT SHE'S BETTER WITH KNIVES THAN ANYONE HERE. WELL, I'VE CERTAINLY DONE MORE COMPLICATED SURGERY WITH DULLER ONES. YOU REMEMBER THAT WOMAN FROM WILMINGTON, MARGARET? SHE LOPPED OFF HER FINGER WITH A BREAD KNIFE, SILLY THING. BLED LIKE A HEATHEN. I HAD TO DO THE SURGERY RIGHT THERE ON THE KITCHEN TABLE. COULDA REATTACHED IT, TOO, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT SERRATED EDGE. UH, COULD I HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF HAM THERE, IF YOU'RE STILL CARVING? WHY SURE. SHARP, NOT SERRATED. THAT'S GOOD. HERE'S TO MISS CHARLIE KATE. WELL... AND HERE'S TO MARGARET. AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER LET YOU GO IN NOW. IF YOU HAVE TO. YOU'D BETTER CHECK IN ON THE DOCTOR. SHE DIDN'T SEEM HER USUAL MEAN SELF TONIGHT. WELL, SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BE MEAN ABOUT. BOTH HER GIRLS ARE HAPPY. YOU ALL RIGHT? AH. INDIGESTION. TOO MUCH OF A GOOD TIME. WHY DON'T I MAKE YOU SOME GINGER ROOT TEA? THAT'D BE REAL NICE. THANK YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M MOVING. KEEPS THE JUICES FLOWING. WELL, YOU SCARED ME. I THOUGHT YOU PASSED OUT OR SOMETHING NO, I'M JUST MARCHING. I'LL GET YOUR TEA. THANK YOU. HERE'S YOUR GINGER ROOT. THANK YOU. ARE YOU PLANNING ON DOING THIS ALL NIGHT? UNLESS I FALL ASLEEP STANDING UP. WELL, I'LL STAY WITH YOU. NO. I WANT TO. MARGARET, GO TO BED. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. ALL RIGHT, HONEY. NIGHT. NIGHT! MARGARET? THAT IS A SPLENDID FAMILY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PART OF. Margaret: I USUALLY HEARD HER IN THE MORNING. GRINDING HER GARLIC, MAKING HER TEA. SCRUBBING HER MOTHER'S OLD SHOES. BUT THAT MORNING I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. GRANDMA? GRANDMA? OPERATOR? OPERATOR? GET ME THE ATLANTIS AT MYRTLE BEACH. HELLO? WELL W-WHY CAN'T YOU? THERE HAS TO BE A LINE, THEY CAN'T ALL BE BUSY! WELL, I KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS. PLEASE! I NEED A LINE. I NEED MRS. RICHARD BAINES. NO, I CAN'T WAIT! Margaret: THEN I REALIZED I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. IT WAS AS IF SHE THERE THERE TALKING ME THROUGH IT. AS IF SHE WERE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, MAKING IT EASY FOR ME, AS THAT VOICE WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE IT EASY IN FUTURE YEARS WHEN I BECAME A REAL DOCTOR. Margaret: MY GRANDMOTHER, MISS CHARLIE KATE, DIDN'T PURGE WHEN SHE DIED. SHE'D ALWAYS SAID EVERYTHING THAT WAS ON HER MIND AND NEVER REGRETTED A WORD OF IT. I DID WHAT SHE HAD DONE. AND WHAT HER MOTHER HAD DONE, AND WHAT HER MOTHER BEFORE HER HAD DONE.
