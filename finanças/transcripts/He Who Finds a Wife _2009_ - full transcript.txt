Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [somber instrumental music] - [Woman] We're actually going to start abstaining after today until the wedding. I'm gonna ask you this one time. And one time only. Are you seeing someone else? - [Man] No, no, no. - [Woman] Who are you accountable to? - [Man] You are the only woman for me. I cannot wait to make you my wife.

You're totally free. - Whatever, I apologized. - Whatever? Whatever, you ran into me. - No, actually you ran into me. - I don't have time for this. I'm already runnin' late. [midtempo R&B music] - Surprise. - Well, well, well, beautiful. - [giggles] Hi, baby. - Mm, what you doin' here? - I missed you. - Aw. - I just stopped by for a quick minute. - Ah, you're so, so bad. Mm, you know you got me in trouble this mornin'. - I know. That's what I'm supposed to do. - You're so good at it, too. [sighs] I cannot wait to make you my wife. - Baby, you're so sweet. I can't wait either. Oh, you know we gotta go to counseling tomorrow. - Oh. [groans] There ain't nothin' wrong with our relationship. Why do we have to go to counseling? - Baby, the church requires it. - The church, the church. - Plus, you never know what could come out in counseling. - I still don't see why we gotta go to counseling. - Oh, you don't? Baby, please? Just a little meeting. - I don't know about counseling, I could use a little physical therapy say around noontime? - Well, I have a client, but I think we might be able to - Mm-Hm. - Work that out. [knocking] - Oh. - Oh! - [Turner] Comfy? - Woo, hi there, Turner. All right, baby. Just, see ya'll later. - Okay. Mr. Turner, my conference call should be dialin' at any minute. - Good. Bre's gonna sit in on the conference call with you. - Bre? - Bre, I wanna introduce you to Ansel. He's the new Director of Central Affairs. You two are gonna be coordinating often on my behalf, primarily with the new contracts. - Okay. - Ansel, I know your mother taught you better manners than that. - [clears throat] Ansel. - I know, Turner told me. Coffee? - Um, no thank you. I have some green tea. It's supposed to be better for you, antioxidants, prevents cancer or something like that. - I wasn't offering, but thanks for the health lesson. I think we've met before. Remember, you almost made me spill my coffee. - Oh, yes. - I'm out. - How could I forget? Sorry about that. Please, take a seat. - I've already taken the liberty. - So, you work for Mr. Turner. [midtempo R&B music] - Hello, welcome. So glad you could make it, come on inside. - Thank you. Babe, if you don't come in this church. - I'm so glad the two of you could make it. More young people should be getting married, but you know kids these days. They put the cart before the horse. - I know what you mean. - Kids are just shackin' up and having babies. Oh, but you two aren't, of course. - Well-- - We recently moved in together. - Oh. Well, how's your mother, sweetie? - Oh, she's good. - The pastor will be with you shortly. Right this way. Just in here, have a seat. - [Lauren] Thanks. - Sure. And we'll see you Sunday? - [Ansel] Doubt it. - Stop it. - I knew this was a bad idea. - This was not a bad idea, okay? Just quit being so negative. Please. - Praise the Lord. - [Lauren] Hi, Pastor! - How you doin'? - [Lauren] I'm good, how are you? - I'm doin' wonderful, good to see you. - Yes. - How you do? - Pastor Smith. - Good, good to see you as well. - Mm-hm. - So, I remember when you was just a little somethin' boppin' around. Look at you now. You're getting married. - I know. - So tell me about your plans for the future? - Uh. That's a little broad. - What about the children? - Oh, well we both agreed that we wanna have kids in a couple of years. - Yes, first a little boy, then a little girl. - Or a little girl and a little boy. - No, honey, remember? We talked about this. You said it would be nice for our daughter to have an older brother so he could protect her. - But an older sister can protect a little brother just as well as an older brother can protect a little sister. - Well, you two really understand that you really have no absolutely no control which one really comes first. Amen? - Yes. - [chuckles] Amen. - So, okay. We got the money squared away and the kids. So tell me, what about premarital sex? - Oh, that's great. Love that. - You know what, Pastor? We are going to be abstaining starting today until the wedding. - We are? - We are. - What exactly do you mean about? - [Lauren] Not here, okay? - As I was saying, there are going to always be trials and tribulations. But so long as the both parties and persons have something to hold them accountable for their actions and the risk of misdeeds and other infidelities lessens greatly. - You know what, Pastor, I'm really glad that you brought that up because I made it very, very clear to Ansel that I will not tolerate cheating. - Oh, and realize that cheating is not always a deal breaker, honey. - Yes, it is. It is to me. I mean, I've been on the receiving end, and I just will not put up with it. - Baby, I would never do anything to hurt you. - Never say never, Ansel. - I'm saying never. You know I love you. - And I love you, too, but all I'm saying-- - But, where's this but coming from, all of a sudden? - But I won't deal with it again. - If you both have respect for one another, there should be no reason for either of you to need to stray. You should be able to ask Ansel for whatever he's lacking and vice-a versa. - You're right. - Of course he's right. He's a man of God. - Great, now I know Lauren is here on a weekly basis. But Ansel, what about you? - Yes, I know, Pastor. And believe me, I will come more, it's just first I gotta take care of some things-- - Great, then I'll see the both of you all Sunday. Sunday? - See you Sunday. - Sunday, great. - Oh, this is a nice store. - I know, I'm tryin' to redo the whole living room, but I wanna start with the rugs. But I'm lookin' for something with some orange in it. - Well, they have so much stuff in here. - I know. This is cute. - Girl, no that is not. That look like wolf hair, dog hair or something. - Shut up. [women giggle] - Stupid. Now, this is nice, though. - Mm, that look more like you. No offense. - Uh-huh. - That's cute, I'm gonna write that down, Stardust. Now, what were you sayin' about Lorenzo? - Oh, girl, I don't know I just basically fail to understand why I have to be the one to apologize first. He's just too sensitive. I don't understand that. I mean, is it my fault he can't take instructive criticism? [Lauren chuckles] And he's a man anyway. Ain't he supposed to be tough? Whatever. - Now Misty, you know you are not known for your constructive criticism. - And what is that supposed to mean? - I'm just sayin' that sometimes you lack a little thing called tact. - Who? Me? Girl. - Who, yes, you. - No, I have tact. I'm sorry, I have tact. - Tell the truth and shame the devil. - [Woman] Okay, okay, it's such a thing now. - Nobody asked you anyway. - Now, you guys. - Can I get black? - Can you get black? No, you-- - Can I get blue? - Can you? No, no, no. - [Child] Can I get pink? - We're gonna have one color in the whole house. We can't have blue and pink and black. - Oh, uh-uh. Girl, did she really come out the house with rollers in her head? - Yes, she did. - Don't you worry about what it is I'm doing. - Who you talkin' to? [Lauren giggles] - You are the one came outside all unprepared. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. - What? She don't know me. - Misty, see? That is exactly what I'm talkin' about. - Whatever. - You need to learn to give constructive criticism. - You know she was wrong. - I mean, even if she was wrong. And she was wrong for that. - I know she was. - But it's not up to you to tell her, okay? Just chill out. - I got you, I got you. But anyway, what I was sayin' about Lorenzo, I just, all I said was, you just don't wear sandals with socks in the summer. No, not unless you movin' to Miami Beach, old folks don't want sand in your toes, and even still, you don't do that. It's not cute. And he think he's just fly, too. - Socks and sandals. - He got the nerve to get made about it, too. - I don't want that. - I like it. - [Giggles] Socks with sandals. - He'll have to get over it. - That's even kind of cute on the green rug. [slow instrumental music] I still like this one, I like that one. - Lauren. [midtempo R&B music] - [Man] Lauren, Lauren. - [Lauren] I don't have anything to say to you, Jeff. - Lauren, were you just gonna leave me here? - Misty. Look, Lauren, please. I know you're hurtin'. - No, she's not hurt. You're hurt and confused. You see this rock? Lauren does not need you. - Okay, you know what? Thank you, Misty, all right? Just please, just get in the car. I'll only be a few minutes. - Waste. - You have two minutes. What do you have to say? - Oh, so you just gonna get engaged on me, huh? - Where's the confusion? 30 seconds. - Don't you think it's a little soon? - [scoffs] What? Are you kidding me with this? What, am I just supposed to be in mourning after you left me for another woman? Oh, excuse me, your wife. At least I have the decency to wait until after we broke up. Oh, but we never did break up, did we? You just up and left me. - I know it might seem like that. But baby, I just didn't know how to tell you. You know I never meant to hurt you. - Yes, you did. Or do you forget telling me that you never even loved me in the first place and that you were just using me? - I was angry. Lauren, I loved you. - Well, that was three years ago, Jeff, and I've moved on now. - I still love you, and you look great. - Don't you dare do that. - I deserve that. Look, Lauren. Now, you the best friend anybody could ask for. It took me a while to realize that, but what I did was unforgivable. - You leavin' me saved my life. - Well, I just hope he makes you happy. - He does. He's everything you weren't and could never be. - [Wife] Jeff! - Give me couple minutes, all right? I'll be in one second. - What's her name? - Look, um. I just wanted to apologize. - What's her name, Jeff? - It's Sonya. I promise, no matter how tempting things get, I'll never cheat on her. - That's a promise that you need to make to her. Not me. That promise doesn't have nothin' to do with me. - So, can I call you some time? You know, as friends like we used to be? - You know, somehow no doesn't seem like a sufficient enough response.

What are you doing? - I feel like you've been avoiding me lately. - I've just been busy. - What, you don't like me anymore? I know I'm not the only one who-- - Look, what we've been doing is a mistake. - There are no mistakes. Besides, we haven't done anything yet. - Look, I admit. There is some attraction here. But I'm in love with my fiance. - You're, you're right. I was wrong to pursue it. I'm sorry. - No, wait. I was wrong. - Knock, knock, knock, knock. Ooh, I'm sorry, did I interrupt something? - Spencer, what you still doin' here? - I'm gonna talk to you later. - I was workin' late. Man, what are you doin' with that woman? Look, I told you to stay away. - I know, she just came in here. The woman's tryin' to eat me alive. Spencer, you gotta help me. - You need Jesus. - I go to church. - But do you listen? Like when the minister's sayin', do not commit sins against the flesh. I am a man who's about to marry this woman. - You ain't helpin' me. - Today, that we have to be careful how we abuse our relationships. God is saying we have to be careful how we take our young ladies for granted, we have to be careful of how we perceive them, we have to be careful how we deal with them because God is sayin' that when you find a wife, you're not just findin' somebody. When you find a wife, you not just findin' something off the shelf, but when you find a wife, God is sayin' you have found a good thing. God is trying to get us to see, men, that when we find a wife, God is saying he's ready to open up the windows of heaven and began to pour out a blessin'. And God is sayin' that blessing comes in many fashions. He said this blessing comes as a treasure. A treasure to you that's better than diamonds, a treasure that's greater and can shine sharper than gold, a treasure that can be favorable unto the world to ever ending. And so we find that God is trying to get us to see that when you find a wife, you have found something. When you found a wife that you have saw and caught God's attention. When you find a wife, God is tryin' to get us to see that that's all you really need. God is tryin' to get us to see that when we find a wife, he said you not only found favor with God, but when you find favor with God, God is sayin' I'm going to give you favor that have riches. I'm not talkin' about riches of this world, but riches that's going to last. I'm talkin' about favor that somebody's gonna love you despite of, favor that God is going to keep havin' this wife give you hope, favor that this wife is going to protect you when nobody else is gonna protect you. Favor that will last when nothin' else will last. God is tryin' to get us to see that there's a great treasure when you find a wife, a wife that is beauty, a wife that is awesome, a wife that is ever-lasting, a wife that is going to keep you and stick by your side when nobody else will stick by your side. I'm talkin' about even when your friends turn your back, you got a wife to go to. Even when folk lie on you, you got a wife to go to. Even when folks stab you in the back, God is sayin' this wife that I've given you has many treasures, a treasure to love you unconditionally when you mess up. God says she still gonna love you. Even when you don't do right, God says she's gonna stick by your side, even when you don't act right, God is sayin' that wife will show favor upon you that's goin' to stick with you, when nobody else will stick with you. The man that finds a wife. God is sayin' has found somethin'. Not just any old thing, but something. God is sayin' a good thing. And we've got to understand that when God has blessed us despite of our short comings despite of all the things we used to do, God is sayin' I still showing favor upon you by His grace and by his mercy, and I'm willin' to give you a good thing. Now, this good thing is just not going to open up in the beginning, but God is sayin' you got to love this thing back, you got to shake this thing up. You gotta work with it to get it to what God really called for it to do. God is saying, when he bring man and woman together, we become one. That means when I hurt, she hurts. When she hurts, I hurt. And God is sayin' when we love, and I love, she's gonna love. When I began to forgive, she's going to forgive. And when I began to show unconditional love, she's going to show that back in return and vice-a versa. God is saying, this is the kind of favor that comes from the Lord because we know that God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten son and God is sayin', we got to have this same old agape love for when we find a wife. So we just don't find a wife, but God has shown favor to design and to lead a wife to us. We may have met her at a football game, we may have met her at the club, we may have met her on the street, but God is sayin' when you find her, you've found a good thing. - [Congregation] Amen. [congregation applauds] - Thank you. - [Pastor] God bless you. - Oh, that was a really good sermon today, Pastor. - Thank you so much. - I'll see you tomorrow. - I'll look for you tomorrow - Okay. - [Pastor] God bless. A pleasure seeing you, thank you. [midtempo R&B music] - Talk. - [Jeff] I know it was wrong of me to come here like this. - Yes, it was. Hold all my calls, please. - [Jeff] Sonya and I separated. - So? What does that got to do with me? - It was over that incident in the parking lot. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. - Well, it looks like you're movin' up in the world. - I can't complain. - You don't have to act like that. All right, I'm here to tell you that I love you, and my leaving you was the biggest mistake I ever made. - Well, what's done is done. Let's just leave it at that. - Just tell me you don't love me anymore, and I'll leave. - Look, you're gonna leave me alone, regardless. And I do love you. Unfortunately, I'll probably always love you, but I'm not gonna continue to make a fool of myself for you, Jeff. - [Jeff] I want you back, I need you back. - No. - Why not? - Hello, I'm engaged! - You didn't say you were in love. - Well, that goes without saying. Besides, I don't want you anymore. - Now, you don't mean that. - You've hurt me. I've taken you back a hundred times, and a hundred times you've hurt me. Why would I do that to myself again? - Because you love me, too. - I can't. And you need to leave. - All right, fine. You have my number. Call me anytime. - Don't ever come back here again, Jeff. [uptempo R&B music] - Where's my boy? Ansel! His mother named him that. Who ever heard of a black man named Ansel anyway? Ansel! Need some wine. - Why are you talkin' so loud? - I need some money! - Calm down. Have a seat. What's wrong with you? [midtempo R&B music] - Pastor, he just, he just walked right up into my office like we were old buddies. - I just gave you some money the other day. - They're talkin' about foreclosin' on the house. I don't care, forget it. Forget it. - Have you been drinking? - I'm a grown damn man. - Then you need to act like one and show some respect for yourself. - I can't deny that I still have some feelings for him, but I love Ansel. I would never do anything to hurt him. I just can't believe Jeff had the nerve to do somethin' like that. - Well, did you give him any reason to think that he would have another chance prior? - No. I mean, he probably thinks that I'll take him back like I've always done. He'll just give me that sad little puppy dog look, and everything will be okay. - Are you embarrassed of your old man, Ansel? Your mother named you that, by the way. - Yes, I know. You seem to feel the need to remind me of that every time you get drunk. - You should have been a junior. - Oh, god. What's going on with the house. I thought the house was paid for. - But I am done with that, Pastor. I'm a different person now. - I believe that. But you know, once you give yourself spiritually to someone, you become one. That person becomes a part of you. It's important for you to understand that first he must put God first and then you second. - I took out a second mortgage on the house to pay some people I owed, and now they talkin' about takin' my house! - I'll look into it. - Are you gonna give me some money or what? - And God has an order in order for a marriage to be happy, not perfect, but happy. He still feels connected to you. And I think the best thing to do is continue to pray for him. - Hm. You know, I never even looked at it like that. Thank you, Pastor. - You're welcome. [Lauren giggles] My prayers will be with you. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. [Lauren hums] - Hey baby. - Wow. What's the occasion? - Well, Misty is staying with her cousin Jamal tonight, so we're all alone again. - So, does that mean-- - No, Ansel I told you, not until after the wedding. But, I can give you a nice bubble bath and I can give you a nice hot oil massage. Mm, baby you're so tense. - Yeah. My dad came by the office today. All drunk and talkin' crazy. - Aw, honey I'm sorry. - I had to go pay his second mortgage. They're about to foreclose on the house. - After I give you your massage, we can cuddle up and fall asleep. It'll be nice. - Great. Can't wait. - Oh, don't be like that, it'll be fun. Come on. [midtempo R&B music] - Man, I can't take this no more. I have got to get some. - So what, you mean you guys ain't doin' it? - Nah, man. Ever since we started this premarital counseling, all of a sudden we're abstaining until after the wedding. - Abstaining as in all sex? - All sex. - Brother, I'm sorry to hear about that, man. - Wedding's not for another two months, man. I think I'm gonna die before then. - I mean you've gone two months before. Right? - Yeah, but I was single then. Sleeping alone. I wasn't layin' next to the temptation. That's like wavin' a bag of bones in front of a dog and tellin' him not to eat it. - So what, you're callin' yourself a dog now? - No, man, what I'm sayin' is I don't know how much longer I can take this, man. Bre is drivin' me crazy. All my thoughts are focused on her. Her lips, her hips. - Listen, man, the reason you're all focusin' and fantasizin' about her is because she's forbidden fruit. Look, the minute you bite into that fruit, man, you're gonna lose everything. So stop thinkin' about it. - What? - You know what. It. - I really like Turner's idea for us to relaunch that First Five LA campaign. We really need to relaunch that in West LA, like immediately. - I think it'd be good too at the end of the year. - Really? [phone rings] - This is Ansel. - Hey baby. - Hey. - Yeah, I'm gonna go out to my mom's house for a couple of days to pick up some stuff for the wedding, so I'll probably be back in a couple days. - Uh, okay. You're gonna be stayin' at your mom's? - Yeah. - Um, all right, well call me when you get a chance. - I love you. - Love you, too. So, where were we? - I think you were about to ask me over to your place tonight. - Is that right? - What's wrong, you can't keep a secret? - I can keep a secret.

Yeah, right. Like he's really gonna tell me the truth. - Lauren, just ask him. Believe me, then you'll know whether or not he's tellin' the truth. Or you can challenge the game.

[knocks] Lauren, open this door. - [Lauren] Sleep on the couch. - Lauren. [knocks] [Lauren sighs] - Good afternoon. - Hi, Pastor. - I suspect the both of you are blessed today. - Doin' pretty good. - I missed you this weekend Ansel. - Yeah, I apologize. Something came up this weekend. - I understand. Is there something I should know? You know, this is this last session before the wedding. - Yeah, Ansel. Is there something I should know? - I told you I needed to rest this weekend. - And I told you not to miss the appointment. Look, if you're not into this, or if you're having second thoughts or something, you should just tell me now because I don't need a man who's just going through the motions just because that's what it takes to get what he wants. - What is that supposed to mean? What are you talkin' about? - I'm talkin' about you. Ever since I came back from my mom's house you've been trippin'. - That's because you're always accusing me of cheating. - I'm not accusing you of anything, and I never even mentioned cheating. So if you're feeling guilty about something, then that's your fault. - I don't feel guilty. - [scoffs] Then where were you this weekend? - I told you, my father was having some problems. Do we have to talk about this here? - Ansel, we are in counseling. What better place is there to talk about it? - My father has nothing to do with this. - Are you kidding me? Your father has everything to do with this. Have you ever even thought about bringing him to church? He needs help, Ansel. What he doesn't need is somebody who constantly enables him to keep on doing the same damn thing! I'm sorry, Pastor, but-- - So now, all of a sudden, you're all concerned with my father. - Ansel, don't act like this is the first time we've talked about this. - May I interrupt? - Excuse me, Pastor, just hold on. - Who are you accountable to? - Myself. - That's all I needed to know.
