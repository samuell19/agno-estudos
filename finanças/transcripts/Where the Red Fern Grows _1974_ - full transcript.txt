[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WHEN I WAS A BOY, I GREW UP IN THE OZARKS OF OKLAHOMA. MY FOLKS WERE POOR, AND THE PARCEL OF LAND WE LIVED ON WAS ALLOTTED TO MY MOTHER BECAUSE OF THE CHEROKEE BLOOD THAT FLOWED IN HER VEINS. EXCEPT FOR ONE THING, I WAS THE HAPPIEST BOY ALIVE. BUT IT'S HARD FOR ANY BOY TO BE COMPLETELY HAPPY WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING SO BAD, IT GNAWS ON HIS HEART AND GETS ALL MIXED UP IN HIS DREAMS.

[CAR RUMBLING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE HUNGER AFTER ANYTHING THEY WAY THAT BOY DID AFTER THEM DOGS. WELL, I JUST DON'T WANT HIM OUT NIGHTS HUNTIN' WITH HOUNDS. I MEAN, IT'S BAD ENOUGH HAVING HIM PROWLING THE RIVERBEDS IN THE DAYTIME. HE'S A BOY, JENNY. A BOY OUGHT TO HAVE A DOG. AND YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A NEW MULE. I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T HELP WANTIN' IT FOR HIM. HE'S COUNTRY BRED, JENNY, LIKE ME. A BOY LIVING IN THESE HILLS JUST OUGHT TO NATURALLY HAVE A DOG. [DOGS BARKING] [ROOSTER CROWING] BILLY? YES, PAPA? I WAS UP AT GRANDPA'S STORE YESTERDAY. HE TOLD ME OLD MAN STATTON'S COLLIE'S ABOUT TO HAVE PUPS. I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD... PAPA, I DON'T WANT ANY OLD COLLIE DOG. I WANT HUNTIN' DOGS. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, SON, BUT HUNTIN' DOGS COST MONEY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH OF. WELL, RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BLUE TICK PUP FOR SALE IN FRONT OF GRANDPA'S STORE FOR $35. THERE IS? CAN I GO SEE HIM? DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID, BOY? $35. WELL, I CAN AT LEAST GO LOOK AT HIM, CAN'T I? PLEASE, PAPA. WELL, I GUESS IT AIN'T GONNA HURT NOTHIN'. BUT LISTEN, YOU BE BACK HERE AT NOON. GOTTA FIX THAT FENCE DOWN ON THE SOUTH END. [PUPPY WHINING] I DON'T KNOW. $35 IS A HELL OF A LOT TO PAY FOR A DOG LIKE THAT. HE AIN'T WORTH MORE THAN 20, PA. NOT EVEN THAT MUCH. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE PRICE, YOU TALK TO JED PARKER. IT'S HIS HOUND, I'M JUST TRYIN' TO SELL IT FOR HIM. HEY, BILLY. [PUPPY WHINING] OH, WELL, WE'LL TAKE IT. THAT AIN'T NO $35 DOG, BUT I PROMISED THESE BOYS A DOG, AND I'M GONNA GET 'EM ONE, EVEN IF IT'S A POOR ONE. HERE'S $5 AND $25, $35. COME ON, BOYS, LET'S GET TO THE HOUSE. I SURE HAVE SEEN BETTER DOGS IN MY DAY. IT'LL BE HARD, BUT WE'LL MAKE SOMETHIN' OUT OF HIM. [WAGON CLANGING] MAKES ME MAD, FOLKS LIKE THAT GETTING SUCH A FINE HOUND. AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE, IT'LL WIND UP BEIN' AS MEAN AS THEY ARE. SURE WOULD'VE LIKED TO BOUGHT IT FOR YOU, BILLY. I AIN'T MUCH BETTER OFF THAN YOUR PA. OH SHUCKS, YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN HOUNDS BEFORE LONG. I DON'T KNOW, GRANDPA. SOMETIME I THINK GOD DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE ANY. IS THAT SO? WHY? WELL, I'VE BEEN ASKIN' HIM FOR DOGS AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED YET. IT COULD BE THAT YOU AIN'T DOIN' YOUR FAIR SHARE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, IF GOD WAS A MIND, TO GET YOUR DOG'S AS SLICK AS CUTTIN' LINE. HE'D BE DOIN' ALL THE WORK. THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR YOUR CHARACTER. I DON'T WANT CHARACTER, I WANT DOGS. YOU WANT DOGS BAD ENOUGH, BILLY, YOU'RE GONNA GET DOGS. BUT YOU WANT HIS HELP, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEET HIM HALFWAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WELL, YOU THINK ABOUT IT. [BELL RINGING ON DOOR] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] YOU KNOW, I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT GRANDPA WAS TRYING TO SAY TO ME IN THE STORE THAT DAY, BUT AS THE MONTHS PASSED, I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT BY MEETIN' GOD HALFWAY. AND I WAS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO GET MYSELF SOME HOUNDS. I WAS JUST PLAIN TIRED OF ALL THE HEARTACHE. SLOWLY A PLAN BEGAN TO FORM. I'D EARN THE MONEY MYSELF. THE MORE I PLANNED, THE MORE REAL IT BECAME, AND OUT OF THE CLEAR BLUE SKY, I REALIZED WHAT MY GRANDPA HAD MEANT. MY SHARE WAS TO DO THE WORK, AND GOD'S SHARE WAS TO GIVE ME THE HEART, COURAGE, AND DETERMINATION. SO ALL THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SEASON, I WORKED AT ABOUT EVERY ODD JOB THAT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY LIVIN' IN THE OZARKS TO DO. PAPA WONDERED WHERE I FOUND THE ENERGY TO WORK AT THE JOBS I HAD FOUND AND STILL DO MY CHORES AT HOME. I DIDN'T TELL HIM I WAS SAVIN' FOR A HOUND BECAUSE I KNEW HE COULD USE ANOTHER MULE. MANY TIMES I GOT DISCOURAGED BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD TAKE FOREVER FOR ME TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THE HOUNDS I HAD SEEN ADVERTISED. BUT WHEN I WENT TO BED AT NIGHT, I COULD SEE PUPPIES, FEEL PUPPIES, SMELL PUPPIES, AND EVEN DREAM ABOUT PUPPIES. THAT WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP ME GOIN'. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WHERE IN THE BLAZES DID YOU GET ALL THAT? I SAVED IT, GRANDPA, SO I COULD BUY TWO HOUND PUPS. WILL YOU ORDER 'EM FOR ME? HUH. HOW LONG YOU BEEN SAVIN' THAT? A LONG TIME. I DID WHAT YOU SAID, GRANDPA. YOU KNOW, ABOUT MEETING GOD HALFWAY. HE'S THE ONE THAT HELPED ME. DOES YOUR PAPA KNOW YOU GOT ALL THIS? GRANDPA? PAPA NEEDS A NEW MULE REAL BAD. I WANT THOSE DOGS REAL BAD TOO. BEEN WRESTLIN' THIS PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME, AIN'T YA? AM I DOIN' RIGHT, GRANDPA? OH BILLY, THERE AIN'T NO PERSON ON THIS EARTH THAT GOT A RIGHT TO MAKE THAT DECISION, EXCEPTIN' YOU. WELL, SEE, WHEN ONE SIDE WRESTLES ANOTHER SIDE, ONLY ONE SIDE CAN WIN. BILLY, THAT'S YOUR MONEY. YOU EARNED IT. YOU WORKED HARD. YOU WANT THEM DOGS, YOU'RE GONNA GET THEM DOGS BE DAMNED. BE DAMNED. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THOSE WEEKS OF WAITIN' EXCEPT HOW SICK AND NERVOUS I FELT. I COULDN'T EAT OR SLEEP, AND MAMA WAS REAL WORRIED. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] HELLO, SON. HOWDY. WANT ME TO HELP WITH THAT FEED? THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I CAN GET IT. I JUST DROPPED THAT CORDWOOD BY GRANDPA'S. SAID HE HAD SOMETHIN' FOR YA, SO I TOLD HIM THIS EVENIN' THAT YOU MIGHT DROP BY... [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WE GOT OATS, WE GOT SALT, WE GOT SOME RICE... HEY, BILLY! NOW WE GET THE TONIC. THERE WE ARE, TONIC. THERE YOU ARE, FOLKS, I BELIEVE THAT DOES IT. I'LL PUT IT ALL DOWN. OKAY. THANK YOU KINDLY. GOODNIGHT. GOODNIGHT. DID THEY COME? DID THEY COME? WHAT COME?

HE'D BE GLAD TO TAKE YA. SATURDAY? NOW LOOK HERE. YOU JUST CHEW ON ONE OF THESE AND STAND ON YOUR HEAD AND, WELL, IT'LL CALM YOUR NERVES. OH, WAIT A MINUTE, I BELIEVE THIS MIGHT HELP SOME. TEN DOLLARS. WHAT'S THAT FOR? THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING'S GOIN' DOWN THESE DAYS, INCLUDING HOUNDS. THAT'S YOUR CHANGE. A WHOLE WEEK. WELL, YOU'VE WAITED ALL THIS TIME, NOW SURELY A FEW MORE DAYS AIN'T GONNA HURT. I'M THROUGH. OH, OKAY. ALICE, NOW THAT'S LOVELY. IT'S A BABY, MAMA. I KNOW... WILL. LOOK AT MINE, MAMA. OH, NOW SARAH, THAT'S VERY GOOD. WILL? THAT'S, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, SARAH. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL US HOW THIS MEANS LOVE? IT'S A RED FERN, MAMA. A RED FERN? WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH LOVE? ALICE, DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU'VE FORGOTTEN THE OLD INDIAN LEGEND ABOUT THE RED FERN? WELL, THAT'S A SYMBOL OF THE STRONGEST KIND OF LOVE. REMEMBER, ALICE, HOW THE LITTLE INDIAN BOY AND GIRL WERE LOST IN A BLIZZARD AND FROZE TO DEATH? AND THE NEXT SPRING WHEN THEY WERE FOUND, A BEAUTIFUL RED FERN WAS GROWING BETWEEN THEIR BODIES. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU KNEW THAT STORY SO WELL. GRANDPA TELLS IT TO ME ALL THE TIME AND I BELIEVE IT TOO. COME ON. IT'S GETTING LATE, TIME FOR BED. BILLY, I WANT YOU TO FINISH THE SUMS. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BILLY? SHHH. NOT SO LOUD, SARAH. BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING? OH, ALL RIGHT. PROMISE ME YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING AND I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET, OKAY? I'M GOING TO TAHLEQUAH. TAHLEQUAH? SHHH! WHY ARE YOU GOING TO TAHLEQUAH? TO BRING BACK A SURPRISE. PROMISE ME YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING TO MAMA OR PAPA OR ANYBODY. YOU WANT ME TO SAY, "HOPE TO DIE?" NO. WHAT'S THAT FOR? TO BRING BACK THE SURPRISE IN. REMEMBER, NOT A WORD.

[HEAVY WINDS AND THUNDER] [HORSE NEIGHING] I DON'T THINK WE CAN TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS. CAN'T SEE FIFTEEN FEET NOW. THINK WE CAN EVEN FIND THE BUGGY? I THINK SO. CAN ANYBODY HEAR THE HOUNDS? NO TELLIN' WHERE THEY ARE NOW. THINK WE BETTER GO IN? I'M SURE THEY'RE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK. PROBABLY TREED A COON BY NOW AND WE CAN'T HEAR 'EM BECAUSE OF THE WIND. A MAN CAN FREEZE TO DEATH IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER, BILLY. ANYWAY, YOUR DOGS WILL BE GIVIN' UP SOON AND COMIN' IN. NO THEY WON'T, PAPA. OLD DAN WOULD DIE BEFORE HE LEFT A COON IN A TREE. [DOGS BARKING] I HEAR 'EM. THE WAY THAT WIND IS WHIPPING UP, THAT SOUND COULD BE COMIN' FROM ANYWHERE. OFF IN THAT DIRECTION. [HEAVY WINDS BLOWING] HEY, SLOW DOWN, I AIN'T THAT YOUNG NO MORE.

I DON'T KNOW, WILL, IN THIS KIND OF STORM. LET'S KEEP OUR HEADS AND WE'LL FIND HIM. THE DOGS WILL FIND HIM. COME ON, LET'S GO.

HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, BILLY. [WIND BLOWING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK HE BUSTED HIS LEG JUST TO GET ATTENTION, DON'T YOU? [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT, NOW I CAN ALWAYS SAY THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST EXCITING HUNT I'VE EVER BEEN ON. I SAY AMEN TO THAT. [APPLAUSE] WHERE'S BILLY? I THOUGHT HE WAS HERE. THEY'RE ABOUT READY TO GIVE OUT THE TROPHY, BILLY. YOU COMIN'? I JUST ASSUME NOT GO OVER PAPA. ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT IT. I'M NOT BE TELLIN' YA ANY DIFFERENT. YOU'RE A MAN, BILLY. YOU PROVED THAT LAST NIGHT. ...AND THE ACME FEED COMPANY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW WE'VE COME TO THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR, THE PRESENTATION OF THIS BEAUTIFUL GOLD CUP. NOW I DECLARE THE WINNER OF THE 20TH ANNUAL SEVENTH DISTRICT COON HUNT TO BE SAM BELLINGTON. SAM. [CLAPPING] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN. THAT WAS A SPORTSMAN-LIKE THING FOR YOU TO DO. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT WINNING THIS CUP BECAUSE I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR DOGS. NOW HIS DOG TREED THREE COONS AND HE HAD TO GIVE UP AND GO FIND HIS GRANDFATHER. NOW THOSE HOUNDS MIGHT HAVE GOT THOSE THREE COONS, AND THEN AGAIN THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS I DON'T WANT MY DOGS WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP THAT WASN'T THEIRS CLEAR. SO I DECLARE BILLY COLMAN AND HIS FINE PAIR OF REDBONES THE CHAMPIONS AND WINNERS OF THE GOLD CUP. HOW ABOUT THAT? [APPLAUSE] TAKE IT, SON. YOU WON IT FAIR. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] BUT, YOU BETTER BE READY TO GIVE IT UP NEXT YEAR, BECAUSE ME AND MY WALKERS ARE GONNA BEAT THE BRITCHES OFF OF YOU AND THEM REDBONES. [LAUGHTER] THE CASH POOL. [APPLAUSE] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WELL JENNY, THERE IT IS. THE FULL AMOUNT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR. ENOUGH MONEY TO MOVE US LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL TO TULSA AND TAKE OVER UNCLE FRED'S FEED BUSINESS. I FIGURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO GO THIS SPRING. YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE NOT HAVIN' SECOND THOUGHTS, ARE YA... ABOUT LEAVIN'? WELL, HOW'RE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL HIM? I MEAN, WE CAN'T TAKE THESE DOGS FROM THESE HILLS AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN BRED TO DO. IT WOULD BE LIKE PUTTIN' A MAN IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, AND IT'D BREAK BILLY'S HEART TO LEAVE 'EM BEHIND. WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS GRANDPA. WHAT'S GRANDPA GOT TO DO WITH IT? BILLY AND THE DOGS, THEY COULD STAY WITH GRANDPA FOR A WHILE. BESIDES, HE COULD USE SOME HELP OVER AT THE STORE ANYWAY. AND SEPARATE OUR FAMILY? I'M NOT GONNA HEAR OF THAT. [DOGS BARKING] [DOGS BARKING] THE WINNING OF THE GOLD CUP BROUGHT ME AND MY DOGS EVEN CLOSER THAN BEFORE. WE BECAME AN INSEPARABLE TEAM. AND ALTHOUGH I'D ALWAYS KNOWN THEIR LOVE FOR ME WAS GREAT, I NEVER REALIZED HOW DEEP IT WENT UNTIL THE NIGHT OF THEIR GREATEST SACRIFICE AS WE HUNTED TOGETHER IN THE CYCLONE TIMBER COUNTRY. [DOGS BARKING] WHAT IS IT? WHAT DO YOU SEE UP THERE? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. [DOGS BARKING] [MOUNTAIN LION GROWLING] [ANIMALS FIGHTING, SNARLING] GO AWAY! GET AWAY FROM THERE, DAN! [ANIMALS FIGHTING] [ANIMALS FIGHTING] [DOG WHIMPERING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] OH, I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A WOUND. GET ME SOME MORE WATER, WILL. MAMA, WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT? WELL HE'S, HE'S HURT PRETTY BAD, BILLY. HE SAVED MY LIFE. THE LION TRIED TO GET TO ME. WE'RE DOIN' WHAT WE CAN, SON. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] COME ON, LITTLE GIRL, LET'S GO. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] IT WAS HARD TO MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE THAT OLD DAN WAS DEAD. THE PAIN WAS ALMOST MORE THAN I COULD STAND. BUT AS THE DAYS WENT BY, I BEGAN TO FEEL GRATEFUL THAT I STILL HAD MY LITTLE ANN. COME ON, LITTLE GIRL, PLEASE EAT. THE LIFE SEEMS TO HAVE JUST GONE OUT OF HER. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] LITTLE ANN! LITTLE ANN! LITTLE ANN! SHE'S NOT IN THE BARN, BILLY. LOOK IN THE HOUSE. I'VE ALREADY LOOKED THERE. LITTLE ANN! OH, LITTLE ANN. WHY DID I HAVE TO LOSE YOU TOO, LITTLE GIRL? I PRAYED FOR BOTH MY DOGS. NOW BOTH OF MY DOGS ARE DEAD. YOUR MOTHER'S HAD SOME PRAYERS TOO, SON. NOW, BECAUSE OF YOUR DOGS, THEM PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. BILLY, YOUR FATHER AND I KNEW HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO SEPARATE YA FROM YOUR DOGS. WHY, WE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE LEAVIN' YA WITH YOUR GRANDPA FOR A WHILE. BUT I GUESS THE LORD DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE FAMILIES SPLIT UP. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WELL, I GUESS WE BETTER GET STARTED FIXIN' A PROPER RESTING BOX FOR LITTLE ANN. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] MAMA, DO YOU THINK GOD MADE A HEAVEN FOR ALL GOOD DOGS? I'M SURE HE DID, SON. ONLY IT'S MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN IT IS HERE. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. WELL, I WAS HERE FIRST. I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY MORE OF THAT. I WANT YOU TO SIT JUST WHERE I TOLD YA. THAT'S EVERYTHING, PAPA. ALL RIGHT. PAPA, CAN I GO DOWN TO THE RIVER FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES? ALL RIGHT, SON. BUT DON'T BE LONG, WE GOTTA GET GOIN'. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] MAMA, PAPA, COME HERE! HURRY!!! [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WHAT IS IT, BILLY? WHAT'S WRONG, BILLY? OH, A RED FERN. ALL MY LIFE I'VE WANTED TO SEE ONE. WHY IT'S JUST, IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. MAYBE IT'S GOD'S WAY OF EXPLAININ' TO BILLY ABOUT HIS DOGS. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] I'VE NEVER BEEN BACK TO THE OZARKS. ALL I HAVE LEFT ARE MY DREAMS AND MEMORIES. BUT SOME DAY, IF GOD IS WILLING, I'D LIKE TO GO BACK AND WALK AGAIN IN THE HILLS I KNEW AS A BOY. AND I'D LIKE TO TOUCH THE HEART THAT'S CARVED IN AN OLD SYCAMORE TREE THAT SAYS, DAN AND ANN. AND I'LL LOOK FOR THAT SACRED SPOT BY THE RIVER WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS.
