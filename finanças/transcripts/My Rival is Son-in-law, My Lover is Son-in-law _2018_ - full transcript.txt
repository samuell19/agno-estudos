In this film, this lizard is the love interest of the cat and the dog in other words, it interferes in the relationship between the cat and the dog now, don't you think this character has lots of potential? It won't be easy to handle of course it won't, I made it specially for you so, you don't have to worry about anything else if you have the time, just think how to immerse yourself in the lizard's movements and psychology bad person calling! Bad person calling! Bad person calling! Bad person calling! What? Your mum again? Hey, not like she's my real mum come on, your little sister's not as begrudged as you are she is weak-minded, and believes easily. I told you that. My problem is that my memory is too good probably. I will always remember who killed my dad is it that serious? What kind of a psychiatrist hooks up with a patient? One day, my dad went out to sea that doesn't mean she has to do with it she knew my dad is hydrophobic, and she gave him a yacht? Giving him a plane doesn't mean he could fly it too what, why are you defending that woman? If you hate that woman, why don't we... Make a plan and steal all her money then you can star as the lizard very soon anyway, I said it. I won't see that woman ever again and I'm not playing the lizard anymore why not? I characterized it specially for you only you can do it honestly, why a lizard? Is my tongue forked? It isn't now, you know that Dr. Bo, what took you so long?

Let's have dinner some other time our job today is to help the real estates company scare two elderly people away these are our targets, Mr. and Mrs. lui the company is done acquiring all the old buildings except for theirs, they won't leave that's why we are here to tackle them I saw on a ghost rumours website this place is super haunted. See for yourselves hello, this is Simon lui. It has been a while this is where a harrowing family murder case was staged a butcher living here found out his wife to be cheating and he grabbed a knife, hacked her neck for 17 times until he chopped her head off after that, he stood here, and jumped from here after the tragedy the neighbourhood would see every night, the butcher with his wife's head, wandering here and there saying the same thing "kill every soul. Give nothing back" are you sure? How can you believe in Simon lui? It's better safe than sorry. I'm not doing it since when are you such a sissy? What about our friendship? My zodiac offends tai sui this year. I have bad luck I quit hey I will hold on to the clothes first holy shit - you told us to come in the first place - Go who else? I am not afraid of anything. I'm staying a courageous spirit, you see I have something to say I'm afraid of ghosts, but I'm afraid of being poor too now that he's gone can we split his share of money? Anyway you like it no problem with us then we work as a team, don't we sure thing here's the plan lui returns every day at 8pm after running errands you will hide in the lift, and scare the crap out of him with this outfit and some of your acting scaring him will be a piece of cake Mrs. lui comes out every day at 8:15pm to throw garbage away in the stairs hung, that shall be your job I am out of food can you burn me some more? Lui's coming, be alert okay this is bad. If they take the shock badly at this age and if anything happens to them, we'll be condemned we may be doing something bad today but come to think of it, when we becom famous these will all be precious memories of how we enriched our acting what if we have to write autobiographies, and go on TV shows like snl, without anything to share? Understand? Promise me this is going to be our last we love acting, not scaring people he's coming, get ready Why is there no one? Where have they gone? Hey are you taking the lift or not?

Sure what do you want, mummy? Why don't you ask Mr. Leung, see what he likes I am fine with anything auntie Bo, please have anything you like then I'll decide - ok Mr. leung what did you see in Michelle that you like? Mum, don't say it like I'm an old spinster that's not what I mean I mean, Michelle is a nice, beautiful girl why do have such an eye for good girls? Probably because those I met in the past were all bad women now I found a nice girl so I'm not going to let go you had bad experiences in the past I never heard you talk about it it's better to let bygones be bygones as long as I am happy now sometimes, one believed that they encountered bad people but never considers the bad things that they have done auntie, for so many years you had to bring up two daughters all on your own. Was is difficult for you? Ever thought of finding a good man to take care of you? Mummy has many admirers yin, go home in my car today is that so? You are very demanding, and you look down on men what sort of men do you like, I wonder? Honestly, my requirements are simple being honest is most important Simon is very honest so you are not against us, are you? Of course I don't. What's important is what you like thank you mummy say thank you thanks, auntie am I still "auntie"? You should address me like Michelle did come on thanks, mummy that's more like it. Have some food here I never thought mum would like you that much you don't have confidence in me? For my other boyfriends she didn't like them much but she had no negative comments about you one word, "excellent" I don't have any flaws for her to pick on you're so conceited "After tonight, let's meet and talk" "The usual place, I'll wait for you" What do you want, pretty? Lard dregs noodles, little spicy, more vegetables and you, handsome? Lard dregs noodles, very spicy, no vegetables what a unison. You practiced at home? Food will be ready in no time here's some juice for free It's been a while. You've lost weight it's nothing, I'm getting on alright I heard you are getting married yes and you are still by yourself after these years are you really in love with my daughter if you aren't, don't hurt her she is a very simple girl why do you think I will harm her? You know I'm not that kind of person because I know you too well you like to cheat don't you remember? You even went after my best friend why don't you believe in anything I say? Your friend seduced me but you still had to accept it if you know me you will believe that I did nothing at that time let's leave it, it happened so long ago, nothing matters now isn't that so? You men like to put the blame on others and never admit what you did. And when you do that's because someone was wrong in the first place you did something wrong too what? You despised me for being poor you thought I had no future, so you went for someone else I never said that, you just saw me that way you didn't say it but it showed on your face everyone knew you went after Alex you had an affair I said I did not, don't accuse me of that but god is watching. Alex got married last year, and you are not his bride as for me, I'm getting married soon and my wife is very young if you were lucky, you could have been her mother are you done speaking? No, I came here especially to see you to see how down-trodden you are you are not young, fix yourself up or else no one will want you hey you, stay there young boys and girls nowadays are really quick-tempered we were like that too Do you still remember? That corner has never changed in decades that broken brick is still there I did that for you let's say you were violent what violent?

Why don't you come to me, I'll give you a discount you are so ungrateful I fought for you hey, bro, you look familiar I don't know you who are you? I'm that guy with glasses that you beat up in the past I'm sorry, bro for twenty years I come here every night to see if I can see you again I even got the bosslady here just to see you again what a coincidence exactly guys go and get him don't run, don't run... Why have you kept the pager? You too you never contacted me you too how do you know it still works? I asked the telecommunications company as long as you pay, they cannot cancel your number don't you know that? In order for the pager to keep working I bought the whole telecommunications company like an overnight billionaire you splurge whenever you got money. Vulgar tycoon I have lots of money if it is for the woman I love I think it is worth it what you do like? I can buy it for you I never despised you for being poor you know what you did I just didn't like how went around and manipulate people with money I want to tell you that money doesn't solve all your problems I didn't know Michelle is your daughter now that you know, then what? Don't even think about it cheers, son-in-law Treat Michelle well or else I will not let you have it easy Bo, you missed me all along do you really want to know? Yes I will not tell you Do you know what's the difference between a man and a woman? Tell me men is like Bluetooth if his woman is nearby, he sticks to her if she's gone he will go and connect with another woman women are different, they are like WiFi even if she has many available connections around her she will only connect to the strongest one then she latches onto him, and will never change you men fall in love with women one after another how can I believe you? Hello where are you? In a meeting did I interrupt you? No. Not going to sleep yet? Nearly, take your time then I'll sleep now. Good-bye it's Michelle Michelle?

Michelle and I are serious with our relationship auntie, I promise you I'll take good care of her since you are so good to Michelle can you answer three questions? No problem first question there is a 10-billion contract in front of you at the same time, Michelle calling you from the hospital needing you to transfuse blood to save her between the contract and Michelle which will you choose? Easy, I choose Michelle second question is Michelle the last girlfriend you'll ever have? Yes yes third question is Michelle the love of your life? Yes When you answered my first question you right eye looked up towards the ceiling according to psychology you are not speaking the truth second question you touched your chest twice and said "yes" twice yes yes which covers up your untruthfulness when you answered my third question you pointed your chopsticks at the door meaning that you wanted to leave, to escape mummy, don't treat Simon like one of your patients Simon, I hope you don't mind. My mother's just joking with you there is really no big deal about it so long as my daughter Michelle likes it, that's fine isn't that right? Future son-in-law "One year later" We are running late, the show is starting okay, I'll drive faster thank you Lucky he's not here yet you weren't this nervous when you went out with me that's different.

Money is outside the body what's important is to help those really in need you were entitled "king of subdivision" and were widely criticized for your business ethics for squeezing the best out of every deal but why is it that recently your newly built 18-storey mall which had only six toilets to start with was changed just before sale to having one toilet in each level? And you also let the shops for cheap rent to young people in support of start-up businesses in this generation it is very hard for the young to start a business I was poor when I was young I understand the struggle. I want try my best to help my leung for such a drastic change to happen was it because of some sort of impact? I hope your body is fine? A good friend once told me I want to tell you that money doesn't solve all your problems she was right so I learnt to solve problems using my heart once you put your heart into something, you can do everything What? I nearly sprained my ankle don't yell for nothing what do you think Simon asked me to come here for? Boss, would it be that he wanted to kill you? You got someone to ambush him before maybe he lured you here to kill you shut it. It's fine he told everyone around that he didn't mind it. It's fine ow Hey, what now again? There are a lot of mosquitoes oh no what kind of place is this? Wait zika virus, dengue fever Simon is really evil-minded no one would know if we die of poisonous mosquitoes let's leave Philip here Simon, you jerk, I'm here for lunch, not to give out lunch how could you ask an elite like me to do this? You have seven days a week to spend thinking about money you have no wife, and no kids what are you going to do with all that money? Come volunteer when you are free are you possessed by a ghost? You're speaking like a human are you cursed or something? Yes, we both were cursed what curse? A curse to earn money non-stop we labour every day in this lifetime, we missed out on a lot of things but I am already released from this curse I hope to release you too by asking you to come don't you hate me? When did I ever hate on you you bully me all the time I'm like that to everybody as good old pals all those bad memories in the past let us press a "delete" button and let it go Sorry, Simon I'll do as you say, let's forget about the past put your heart to it I will do it with all my heart thanks, Simon all hail Simon can I help you?

Kiki I thought I might be able to see you here you loved mk Woody Allen you must want to be in his movie as his lead actress go away, I don't know you don't be like that, kiki who left me at the hospital that day? Kiki, you sound normal now. You got better your recovery is so fast I got well a long time ago. I was just faking it I heard that the lead character is retarded in this movie so I wanted to get into character first, and get into method acting ladies and gentlemen, in the past 90 minutes my retardedness was so on point that it fooled everyone stop playing with my hair I was nearly shot in the back, I'm scared such awesome acting, I won't say it's the best but at least it is worth an award you even sacrificed me for this character, you must be able to get it why are you here? I'm also an mk Woody Allen fan where there is a female lead, there must be a male lead character kiki, since we are both confident if we do the casting as a couple, it must help score more points this idea is great, I've thought of it too but not with you why? Why don't I introduce my new boyfriend hi You... why... The movie's about to end let's not talk about what happened before simply put, kiki and I it was love at first sight, like a spark of fire no way, you must be acting again kiki, haven't you told him we are so very in love scram? You scram you go - you go you go go where? Go where? What? Go? Go where? Stop, I'll go you go - we aren't done leave - I'm not leaving just go away - you go away why don't you go? Stop it. Everyone's gone, what is there to argue? No one likes you here, go away I'm back kiki - how was it? Yeah, how was it?

I'll show you sure wonderful that's not it, there's more bravo you must get the role no She said the role is not for me why? You did so well, that's not right "fudge" it. The movie is in english nobody told me that in english? Western movies are in english, don't you know? - Western movie? - Yes since when is mk Woody Allen that good? His movies are always kind of "western" why didn't you tell me, I shouldn't have done method acting I should have learnt english instead mk Woody Allen is such a jerk all of his movie names are the same, who's going to remember I won't tolerate it even if I'm a fan do you have any suggestions? Let's go beat him up go Okay Peace and Harmony to you and your family in the year of the dog may everything go well for you wish everyone a good morning, goodnight, and good health every day wish you all an energetic year ahead may all your wishes come true great fortunes and prosperity wish you a great start after good rest, the best and the good jest to good health and a good future in the year of the dog
