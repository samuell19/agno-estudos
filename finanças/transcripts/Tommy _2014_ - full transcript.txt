There was a car chase and shootout with automatic weapons at the airport runway yesterday. Three or four masked men stole an armored money truck the police think that it could be an inside job. After the robbery this morning, the money truck companies stopped transporting valuables. The thieves had yellow reflective vests of the same type as airport staff. Can you call it a successful police work when 40 million are still missing? I will not use the word "success." It's a frustration, of course, that we have not found the money. - Rikard, where is he? - Sri Lanka . - What part? - I do not know . up to you Wait here, honey. - Is there a problem? - I have to ask you to wait for a while.

Yes, but you do not know him. You know that it was him who paid for Rikard funeral? He sold his best friends. They escaped with forty million. Landvetter ... I told Tommy before it was too much money. People become greedy. He did not listen. Rikard would give me Tommy's share, but Rikard was killed. And suddenly Bobby looks like the king of the city. He cheated us. You too What will Tommy do? We gotta get out of this damn country. Refrigerator Market in Asia exploded. Everyone wants to have a refrigerator.

Cokie here. Remember the stuff I asked you to keep? Good. Tommy wants it back All right. Right. - The remainder were retired? - Yes. Everything is gone. including money.

Filmed her for a few days. Every day after work, she stand up, take a bus a few blocks away. Then she gets into her van ,changed and comes out fresh, clean and healthy. Then she will eat at fine and expensive restaurants. Son of a bitch. Fool people that way. When Tommy comes home? It says in the newspaper today that he is dead. But that's exactly what we want.
