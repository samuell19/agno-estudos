♪ ♪ Hi! What's in the macchiato? Espresso and milk. Oh, that's way too much caffeine for me for the afternoon. How about the latte? Espresso and milk. Hmm. How about the flat white? They're basically all the same thing. OK. I will have the peppermint cold brew. No, uh, a butterscotch cappuccino. No, no, uh, the iced unicorn matcha. You know what? I'll just have, uh, the oat milk brûlée latte. Actually, I'll... I'll have a, uh... cup of hot water, please. At least it won't keep me up tonight. Could have used a bit of milk, though. Heads up! Watch it, Steph! Sorry, Ann. Um, can you toss it back? - I don't know. - Oh, come on! What's the worst that can happen? Are you kidding? We're risk analysts. I could tell you precisely what might go wrong. Let's say I toss it back. But, without a direct line of vision, plus my notoriously bad aim, there's a 60% chance that I hit your "don't kiss me, I'm a risk analyst" coffee mug, spilling it all over your desktop and ruining an entire day's worth of work. Plus there's a 19% chance of residual splashback landing on your new outfit, ruining it for your date whom I met at the Christmas party, and I very much want to like me. Well, you are good at this. Uh, so toss it back? Did you not hear a word I just said? Come on! It'll be fun. LeBron! Ann... A moment? Oh! My coffee mug. I was going to, uh, recycle that. Ann, there's something I need to talk to you about. OK, I'm not sure I like where this is going. You've been with us for a while now. Six years, 8 months, 13 days. Who's counting? A position is opening up in our international department. Oh! - You don't say! - Yep! We're looking for someone, a real star, to get out there and interface with our high-value global clients. OK. Cool. No biggie. So, do you think Steph will take the job? Steph... You've been working together for a while. Do you think she's a good fit? Yeah, Steph, she's... She's great. I mean, I once saw her get into a fight with the water cooler, and the water cooler won, but... Are you... are you sure you... you want Steph to be the face of Managed Risk Services? Well, is there anyone you think would be better? Not off the top of my head. In that case, I'll generate a list of candidates. HR wants a decision by the end of the week. I'll shoot you something to look over ASAP. Cool! Uh, I'm... I'm glad I could help. So dependable. Best second in command a guy could ask for. Oh, uh, and Ann? Thanks for being such a team player! What kind of foreign clients are we talking about? We have satellite offices in Sydney, Buenos Aires and Bali. Hmm. So, notoriously boring places. Samantha... I'm just trying to understand why you're not putting yourself up for your literal dream job. You're smart, you're driven, you're more than qualified. Isn't it worth the risk? I don't know if it's what I want right now. Besides, what if I put myself out there, and they say no? Then at least you tried. You can't succeed if you don't at least try first. Take that cake, for example. What about it? It took you 15 minutes to decide to order it. So? It's vanilla cake with vanilla frosting. - It was the... - Safe choice. But there's nothing fun about it. And you don't even really like vanilla. Point taken. You need to get out of your comfort zone, for your own sake. Why? It's called a "comfort zone" because it's comfortable. I'm just saying, whether it's work or, if we're really getting into it, your dating life, if you keep playing it safe and getting in the way of your own happiness, everything is gonna be vanilla. And there's nothing wrong with that. - Oh, sorry, one second. - Mmm. Hey, Dad! Hey, kiddo! How are you holding up? Oh, just fine. I'm out with Samantha. What's up? There was a little accident. - Are you OK? - Yes! Yes, totally. Um, 100%, totally fine. Uh, but, well, um... - My arm is in a cast. - What? I just took a bit of a spill. - When? - Yesterday. You broke your arm and waited a day to tell me? No, no, no! I fractured my arm and waited a day to tell you. But, really, there's... there's nothing to worry about. Dad! What? Look, I... I know how busy you are. I just didn't want to bother you. You have to tell me when you break your arm. It's just the two of us now. We have to look out for each other. I know, I know. You're right. Uh, and I hate to ask you this, but could you come home for a little while? Just to help me out until I get used to this stupid cast? Of course. I'll be there first thing in the morning. Thanks, Annie. Love you!

She was just standing there, taking her sweet time, asking poor Dale a million questions when the man only has, like, 5 items on his menu anyways. I swear, Rachel, some people just don't know what they have in life. At least I'm lucky because I got... - You! - You! Uh... Sorry. Uh, welcome to Blum's Flowers. How can I help you? Uh, my dad lives in town, and he had a little accident, so I wanted to get him something. Oh, is your dad Jim? I heard he got kicked by a mule. No. Is it Paddy? He fell down a grain elevator. Not him, no. Has to be old Gary. I heard a mule kicked him into a grain elevator. No, but wow! This town has changed since I was a kid. Yeah. Um, so, do you have your sights set on any particular flower? Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to begin. It's kind of overwhelming, huh? Like a certain deli counter. Do you have anything that says: "I love you, and get well soon"? Yes, I have an idea. So, we always start off our bouquets with some foliage. How about we start with a foundation of cream roses? One in the middle as such, surrounded with... 4 other equally as stunning roses. Uh, the eryngiums are a nice touch to add. Oh! Now we can add some carnations. They're warm and comforting, not somber. Some crispedia. Some alliums. Gives you a great balance of color. Some blue eucalyptus. And they smell lovely. And we surround them with pincushions, kind of like the guardians of this bouquet. And the master touch is a pinecone. And this basically will say: "I love you, but you're my father, so I also respect you and appreciate you." Pinecones say all that? Yes, they do. A few last touches, and we are just about ready to wrap this up. Voila! It's stunning! Thank you. Thanks. - You gonna be OK? - Yeah. - Yeah, OK. - Thanks. - Hey, pumpkin! - Hey, Dad! Ah! Thanks for coming all this way. It's no problem, really. Wow! Those for me? - Yes. - Wow! Oh... Still getting used to this thing. How are you feeling? Uh, all things considered, pretty good. Although the doctor says I'm gonna be in this thing for another 4 weeks. - What happened? - It's just a scratch. Come on, tell me! Is it embarrassing? - Did it happen in the bathroom? - What? No! Get the door for me, will you? This isn't over! - Flower guy! - Deli lady! Hey, Aaron! I see you met my daughter, Ann. You're Tom's daughter. Why are you on a first-name basis with my dad? Got my delivery? Yeah, Aphrodite roses, Peruvian lilies and the cholla cactus skeletons you ordered. Yes! I'm sorry, "ordered"? Ah, ha ha! The bouquet! - Oh, the pinecone, masterstroke! - Right? They're just so rich and texturally vibrant and... Yeah, uh, no problem. Will someone tell me what's going on? - Um, we... - Compete together. Compete? At what? Um, let me show you. - I'm gonna go grab the box. - Sure. Come on! OK, so, I cannot wait for you to see this. See what? I probably should have told you earlier, but I didn't want to spoil the surprise. We are competitive flower arrangers. Dad! This is amazing! It was something your mom got into. She would drag me to all these competitions and introduce me to all these people. She dreamed about competing, but she never got the chance. I had no idea Mom was into this. You know your mom. Always on the lookout for her next great adventure. After we lost her, I don't know, I guess I just thought this could be my next great adventure. It's sweet. Anyway, a couple of weeks after she left us, I was walking home, and I saw the young guy who did the flowers for your mom's funeral. And he was in his shop. He was making an arrangement. And I don't know. It just made me happy to see color and beauty again. Yeah, and your dad took to it immediately. He's a real natural. So, what do you guys do exactly? You just... smush flowers together? The technical term is we "arrange" flowers. Yeah, there's not a whole lot of smushing going on. Yeah, basically, teams of two work together to build floral arrangements based on a standardized set of flowers and equipment. And whoever is best, well... Yeah, we were supposed to be competing at the end of the week. The Botanic Cup. It's kind of like the Super Bowl, except with flowers instead of cool commercials and lousy football. Exactly. The Botanic Cup is the biggest flower arranging competition in the state. Aaron and I would be competing if I wasn't a clumsy ox and tripped over that flowerbed and broke my arm. Without the old pruning arm, I'm pretty useless to Aaron. It's all right, buddy. Just making it this far is an achievement. You know what? Uh, about that, I looked into the competition bylaws, and apparently, there is an exception for a competitor dropping out. Says right here: "If a contestant must prematurely exit due to illness, "mule injury or grievous bodily harm, their position will be awarded to their next of kin." I'm sorry, you really gonna trust a rule book from 1889? There's, like, a whole subsection about allowable skull shapes in there. I asked, and they said yes. Annie, if you compete for me, we got a real shot at winning. What do you say? For me? For Mom. Tom, we can't ask this of Ann. I'll do it. I'd do anything for you and Mom. Yes! Yes! Thank you, Annie. I'm sorry, but do you know anything about floral design? No, but, uh, neither did my dad, and look how far he's come. Exactly. And Annie is my daughter. I'm pretty sure talent runs in the family. I... I don't know about this. Just give her the crash course. She'll be up to speed in no time. Well, this seems like a terrible idea, but fine. But I'm gonna need your help around the shop this week. Help you get your head in the game. Plus, if I'm teaching you, I'm gonna need an extra hand. - Deal. - Yes! I'm telling you, this is gonna be awesome. Mark my words. What do you say we go unload that cacti out of your trunk? Actually, you know what? You can unload it, and I'll watch. After you, partner. See you at my shop in an hour? I hope you know what you got yourself into. I'm really gonna do this. I'm really gonna do this. OK, newbie! Qualifiers are on Saturday. If we place in those, we can move on to the finals on Sunday. If we want a chance at winning, we gotta get you prepped. This ain't your garden variety competition. I get it. "Garden." Oh, you weren't making a pun. This is the big show, the grand finale, the biggest moment in your life. Are you ready? We are talking about flowers, right? OK, how would you rank your botanical skills? Um, beginner. Do you have a favorite flower? Can you name a flower? Uh, red. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Uh, roses. They're red. And violets are blue. Violets are violet. It's in the name. It's as if you were to call an orange yellow. You know what? Here. Here is a Pink Floyd rose. It's a great beginner flower. - It's pretty. - It looks simple. But there's a trick to making the ordinary really pop. See, you just reflex the petals like this... and you get... something unexpected. You try. OK. Reflex the petals. Got it. You catch on fast. I'm a risk analyst. It's my job to catch on fast. - A risk what? - Analyst. I haven't heard of it. I get paid to figure out any problem that someone could possibly face. Sounds like a lot, taking on other people's problems and making them your own. And solving them. That usually involves figuring out supply chains or upgrading cybersecurity, you know, things that tend to be a little more complex than pop out a flower. Well, if that's how you feel, why don't we just, uh, jump into the deep end? OK, so, you want your flowers to tell a story. Greenery. A story about who you are, what your passions are, generally, what you like in life. And you always start with a... a star flower, 'cause this star flower will anchor your arrangement. And then, just like with any other story, really, fill in the blanks. See how easy it is? Once you find your North Star, you just let your creativity flow. Yeah, I don't think I can do that. Oh, sure you can, with a little bit of practice. So let's do this. Here... you have a pink hydrangea and a white lily. Pick one, and we can go from there. Right. Just pick one. I can do this. Yeah. There's no need to get into your head. Just make up your mind and launch yourself from there. No... - I'll pick the pink one. - All right. - What's it called? A hydrangea? - Mm-hmm. That's a weird name for a flower. Sorry. Focus, OK. 95% of products aimed towards women are pink, so that makes it a logical choice for a flower story I'm telling about myself. But does its popularity mean it's too mass market and basic? Is that what I think about myself? Either way, there's literally no wrong answer. - I'll pick the white one. - OK. But it's... It's just... It's white, you know. Is that too bland? Or too exclusive? Am I doing myself a disservice by not choosing a color? What story am I trying to tell? Who am I, even? What am I doing with my life? Oh no! You know what? It's OK! I'm sorry. Just stop... smashing things. Just think very carefully: Are you in a position to smash any more pots? No. All right, then. Uh, is my shop going to survive this week? Am I gonna survive this week? All right, so I think we're gonna start simpler, much simpler. How simple are we talking? Uh, I'm thinking entry level. Ah, OK. It's the last one, I promise. Well, the tillandsias give you a sense of motion. But if you want to fill in the cracks, what you gotta go with is the hydrangea. That's your money flower. You really know your stuff. It helps when you love what you do. - Question. - Answer. How does a guy like you get into the cutthroat world of competitive flower arranging? Well, I kind of fell into it. Please. You fall into knitting or jigsaw puzzles. You don't fall into floral work at competition level. What's the real story? Well, it was the Rose Bowl. A football game got you into flowers? I was gonna play in it. - Wait, what? - Yeah! Before I was your humble neighborhood florist, I was actually a wide receiver for Penn State. No way! I was gonna declare for the NFL draft and everything. So, what happened? I tore my ACL in practice two days before the game, and the doctor said I'd be lucky if I managed to walk again. Needless to say, my football career was over. Statistically speaking, ACLs are the number-one career enders. Sorry. I did an analysis for the Eagles once. Keep going. So, I'm in this hospital in Pasadena, my dreams and future in complete flux, and my teammates are gonna play the biggest game of their lives. I look outside, and there were flowers. It was the Rose Parade. Turns out the hospital was on the parade route. All those flowers decorating cars and trucks, I'd never seen anything like it. It was beautiful. I imagine it's way cooler in real life than on TV. Yeah. People were cheering and laughing. It just sparked something in me. I was an athlete my whole life, and flowers were gonna be my chance to compete again. So, Mr. Football Star, who are we competing against? Former power lifters, retired kick boxers, uh, sumo wrestlers on injured reserve? No, nothing like that. Mostly retirees and florists. But don't think for a second that they're not in it to win it. We've got the Hayden twins. Fraternal, not identical. We've got Linda Thompson and her husband, Keith. Where's my dad? And who's that cute girl you have your arm around? - Uh, we don't need to... - Aaron Blum, is that you? Oh, our competition. Toni, hi. What are you doing here? Same thing as you, I'm sure. Getting inspired. You're a competitor too? Returning champion. You want to introduce me to your new girlfriend? - I'm just the... - She's my... ...flower arranging buddy. - Cool. - We're not even friends. We just met, actually. I don't think he likes me much. It's a whole thing. Throttle down. Well, I'll see you both on Saturday. And, Aaron, try to make it over the finish line. It's always a pleasure. OK, wow! What's her deal? We used to compete together. Oh, come on. We don't anymore, obviously. I don't know. My dad seems like a real downgrade compared to her. Yeah, and we dated. Toni is the reason why I don't date. You don't date, like, now? Or you don't date, like, ever? Well, she taught me that flowers are way easier than relationships. Flowers don't pick fights with you. Flowers don't get mad at you for forgetting their birthday. Flowers don't change the language in your phone to Korean and lock you out of the house in a bathrobe at 2:00 a.m. That's far too specific to just be an example. I just know more about myself now. I know I don't have time for romance. I do, on the other hand, have a special place in my heart for... matthiola. - Matthiola. - Matthiola. Yesterday was a big day for you. Yeah. I guess it was. I've never been to a botanical garden before. You looked a little off. I was, you know, overwhelmed, but it's fine. You know, I worry about you sometimes, Rachel. Rachel? Ann. My name is Ann. I'm sorry. Uh, what? - Were you talking to someone? - No, I was... Talking to your imaginary friend? No! No, I, um... It's OK. I had one too, when I was 5. It was a tie-dyed zebra named Mademoiselle Glitterpasta. Right. Um, thank you so much for helping out. No problem. So, do you think we actually have a shot this weekend? Well, that's still to be determined. Uh, if we compete and if we want to win, I've gotta get you to at least a basic understanding of the mechanics. I'm ready. Teach. So what we gotta do is move quickly and decisively, be in each other's heads, think independently, but move in complete synchronization. Synchronization, got it. OK, first, you have to make a passable cut. I'm ready. All right. So here it is. Easy, delicate and across the grain. Put it at an angle and chop. We did it! We trimmed a flower! You trimmed a flower! Uh, now you just gotta make several thousand more of those, and maybe we'll get a chance to win. Pleasure doing business with you, coach. And if we win the qualifier, then Aaron and I go on to compete for the main prize. I like seeing you this excited! No more vanilla. Is that the, uh... The vanilla cake? You better believe it is. Celebration or stress? Stress. I got an email that my aloe vera supplier is going out of business. So, what did you do? Well, I called my ex, who knows a guy who knows a guy down in Mexico that can get me the supply I need. But it's only a stopgap. So, tell me about Aaron. He's a nice guy. Sounds like a stud. Stop. I just assume that a single former football player, small-town florist is super duper handsome. He's my dad's friend, Samantha. Wait, he's not, like, 60, is he? I mean, I'm not... I'm not ruling that out, but... No, he's our age. And we're just working together to help my dad win the Botanic Cup. Wow! He is hot! Real man sandwich! What does that even mean? I heard my niece say it one time, and now I'm obsessed with it. And how do you even know what he looks like? I googled him while you were talking about flowers or whatever. Thanks. You're a real friend. Just keeping an eye out on my bestie. So, I'll see you this weekend? Are you sure you want to come all the way down here? There's no guarantee we'll make it to finals. I have a feeling you will, because you're awesome and I love you and you can achieve anything. You're too much. Seriously, though, there's really nothing going on there? Absolutely not. He doesn't even date. And besides, who says that I want to anyway? I believe you. Goodbye. I always wondered what went into a wedding bouquet. Each one is unique. You have to match it to the customer. And I'd like to think that it makes their special day that much better. So, do you have any first-hand experience? - With what? - Weddings, marriage. Oh, no, no, no. Never. Well, that's not entirely true. I did almost marry Toni. - Oh. - Yeah. - OK. - Mm-hmm. That all makes sense now. What happened? Uh, the dream ended, and then the partnership ended. Yeah. How about you? Do you ever think about taking the plunge? Yeah, I was engaged once. Or, rather, he proposed, and I was really considering saying yes. I was, like, 87% certain that it would work. But I had to run all the numbers, and... 'Cause it felt like the right thing, but it also didn't. And then, after a month, he told me I was taking too long, and now he's with a hot yoga model. I mean, she's not a hotyoga model. She's a model for hot yoga. Though she is very pretty. Hmm, wow. And now they're engaged. And I'm sleeping in my childhood twin bed and arranging flowers because my dad fractured his arm, so I think we're both doing pretty great. Well, for what it's worth, I like having you around. You sure you wouldn't rather have my dad here? Hey, listen, Tom's a great guy, but you tell 1000% less dad jokes. OK. What's wrong? Uh, just my boss. He wants me to go over a list of candidates for a big promotion. Oh. And are you yourself one of those candidates? No. But it's fine. Are you sure? 'Cause it doesn't seem fine. I mean, I... I should be a candidate. I just haven't exactly told him that I want to be. Why not email him right now? Just tell him: "Listen, I am the perfect candidate "for this business thingy that we do, and my friend Aaron totally agrees with me." Yeah, I don't think that would go over super well, but... Well, you don't know unless you try. No risk, no reward. Why does everyone keep saying that? Because maybe you need to hear it. I just feel like since my mom died, I've been looking for this safety. And my job definitely provides that. But what if I don't just want safety? Well, as someone who's had an unexpected shift in careers, I can tell you that, sometimes, taking that risk is what's gonna make your life that much happier. Thanks for the advice. I'll tell you what: I'm going to the flower market this afternoon. Uh, since you're learning to be a champion and all, why don't you tag along? Help familiarize with the flowers. Yeah. That would be great. Oh, and, uh, Tom can come too. You know, it might be nice to get him out of the house. Yeah, he... he would love that. It's a date! Oh! Look at these succulents! They're amazing! I love this place. Everything is just... Oh my! Look at the orchids! Look! They're so lush and purple! Guys, I'm gonna go check out the petunias. I'll be right back. All right. Thank you. For what? I genuinely haven't seen him this happy since before my mom died. Well, he's been cooped up inside. I just thought he could use some sunshine. I mean not just today. Well, it's my pleasure. Your father is a natural. You helped a lonely old guy find his second act. Hey, you want to do something special for him? Sure! Why don't you get something from here? Morris! Aaron Blum! If it isn't my second-favorite customer! This is Ann Keller. Tom's daughter! Now, there's my favorite customer. Oh! Listen, uh, we were hoping to get some stargazer lilies to surprise Tom with. Oh, about that... Oh no! What happened? We're having problems at the farm. Flowers just aren't growing like they're supposed to, and whatever makes it winds up getting eaten by the darn deer. I'm sorry to hear it. Ah, it's part of the life, I suppose. You know, money's been a bit tight lately, and I'm just not sure what the solution is. - Maybe I can help. - Oh! You're in horticulture? Uh, even better: risk management. So that's a no to horticulture? I can have a look at your problems, analyze the angles and come up with some possible solutions, just like that. I appreciate it, but, uh, I'm not sure I could afford you. Oh, it's on me. Any friend of Aaron's and my dad's is a friend of mine. Well, that would be wonderful. Thank you. Annie! Come check out these hydrangeas. Your, uh, new girlfriend is a sharp one. - Not a girlfriend. Partner. - Mmm. - Competition partner. - Right. Miss you, Mom. Annie, a little help! Coming, Dad! How am I supposed to eat with this thing? You'll have to learn to use your left hand for a while. But if you're gonna grumble, I could make you a smoothie instead. Have I told you you're the best daughter in the world? So, it's going OK with you and Aaron? Yeah! I'm learning a lot from him. The two of you have been hanging out a lot. Well, we gotta get friendly fast if we're gonna bring home the Botanic Cup. That's my girl! Smooth move, getting me here so I could win a flower competition for you. I actually like having you around. And I knew you'd be a total natural at it. I kind of am. We're actually heading out to Morris's farm today. Oh! I love that guy! I heard! His stargazer lilies, right? Mm-hmm. Oh, I don't suppose you can pick me up some alliums? They were your mom's favorite. Yeah, of course. They were actually the first flower I tried to plant in her honor. Turns out the soil here isn't exactly perfect conditions for it. Well, figures. I'm sure she'd be proud of you for trying. I bet she'd be proud of you, jumping in to help me win some silly competition. Um, maybe I can make you that smoothie later. In the meantime, do you think you could handle the Herculean task of moving these strawberries from the bowl to your mouth with your non-dominant hand? Very funny. I'll be home by dinner. Ooh! Look at my little girl! Running out to meet with a boy. Dad... - It's just like high school! - It is not! Oh, it really is. Don't be embarrassed if you have a little crush! Aaron is a good-looking guy. - Bye. - Bye! Yeah, man, this doesn't look good. I know. It's been like this all season. I'm really not sure what to do about it. I'm sorry, Morris. This is above my pay grade. I'm not sure what the play is here, buddy. I think I might have something. You said it was just this season? Yeah. Can't figure it out. - Could be the soil, but... - Red clover. If you plant 90% of your usual yield of heliotropes, but add 10% of red clover as a companion plant, its high natural nitrogen levels will boost soil rejuvenation by 18%. And you get the added bonus of some beautiful flowers to look at. You'll have a slightly smaller yield, but you should be back up to 100% by next season. Wow! Um, that's a lot more statistics than I usually use while planting. You also have a problem with deer, right? Yeah. We don't have the budget to replace the electric fence. You don't have to. You can plant aloe vera. It'll grow twice as fast in nitrogen-rich soil, and keep the deer away. And I have a buyer for you! My friend needs it for her skin care line. That's extra money in your pocket. Hey! I don't know how to thank you. It's nothing, really. Well, take anything you want from my farm, free of charge. It's on me. That's very kind. Thank you. Hey, how was your harvest? Pretty good after the rain we had. I found some morchella down by the creek the other day. You guys should check it out. What do you say? You wanna go foraging? I would say yes, but I have no idea what you guys are talking about. - Just come with me. - Thanks, Morris. Thank you. Morchella what? Morchella esculenta. Translation? Morels. They usually grow near trees and especially love the soil near creek beds. How do you know so much about mushroom hunting? Well, I'm a member of the local mycology society. And, actually, Morris is our president. Is that, like, a fan club for mushrooms? Pretty much. Flowers and fungi. Just keeps getting better and better. Oh, score! So, the first thing you're looking for is this honeycomb cap. Then you want to slice it open and make sure the inside is hollow and that the cap is attached to the stem. So what happens if it doesn't meet the requirements? Well, then it's a false morel. You'd be amazed at how closely the impostors resemble the real thing. I would, would I? Yes, you would. Kind of looks like a pinecone. Yeah, they kind of do. It'd be crazy to put this in a bouquet, though, right? Well, it all depends on the story you want to tell. Look! There's more! - Once you start seeing them... - You can't stop? Do you want to get a bite to eat or something? Uh, you know what? Any other time, I would. But I just... I gotta get back to the shop and check on something. - I'll see you later. - Yeah! Yeah, you will. Yeah. Oh, hey, Ann! Heard this was your mom's favorite flower. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow? All right. - Bye! - Bye! I'm telling you, Dale, she's really taking to this. I think we actually have a shot. And this is Tom's daughter you're competing with? I'm just showing her the ropes right now while Tom gets back on his feet, or should I say arms. Yeah. You seem pretty excited to be competing with her. Oh, of course I'm excited. We got a chance to win. This is huge. Mm-hmm. Ex-football stars don't get a lot of chances to compete at championship level. You know this. I know how much this means to you, Aaron. I'm just saying you seem to enjoy the company. There's nothing wrong with that. Don't start with me, Dale. You know how I feel about relationships after Toni. I'm not saying you have to run off and marry this girl. It's just nice to know you have someone around who's not made out of cellulose. You been saving that one? It's one of the 3 words I remember from high school biology. The others are "riboflavin" and "parakeet." We did a lot of bird stuff. Listen, I'm just happy alone, all right? I don't need another Toni in my life. Good thing she's an Ann. I appreciate it, Dale, but that's not what this is, OK? We are quite literally in it just to win it. Mr. Mann! I've been meaning to call you. Look, I'm so glad we could finally connect. Listen, something came up, and the big bosses want to speed up the timeline. I thought you had until Monday to decide. The higher ups are getting antsy, and I need to make a decision by Monday morning. And you know how much I trust you, so who do you like? I was actually thinking... What about me? Or not. What am I saying? I don't... I don't want to go abroad. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm... I don't even like going abroad. You know what? Forget it! I don't know what I'm talking about. I actually am perfectly... I'm happy... I'm happy where I am. I am. Yeah, sorry. I must have lost you for a second. Uh, what were you gonna say? Nothing. I will, uh, have a look first thing this afternoon and let you know as soon as possible. OK, great! I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks, Ann. I'm sure we can find a solution. Yes, of course. Yeah. It's... it's not a problem. Hey! I wanted to show you something. I know it's not the most mind-bending arrangement, but I wanted to prove to you that I could do it on my own. What now? Hey! That... that looks great! Everything OK? Yeah. Sorry, I just got some annoying news. What's wrong? I'm doing a wedding today, and the bride is being a royal pain. Well, it's her big day. If she wants to be a nightmare, who are we to say she's not entitled to it? I understand that, but she wants her entire floral palate changed, and she's getting married in 8 hours. Whoa, lady! It's your wedding. There are more important things to worry about. Like whether your uncle will slip the DJ a $50 bill to play Monster Mashon loop. It happened at my cousin's wedding. So, I know this is kind of last minute, um, and if you don't want to do it, that's totally fine. I completely understand. Out with it. Would you mind coming along and giving me a helping hand? A wedding is pretty major league. I mean, I've only been doing this a couple of days. Yeah, but you've been doing it nonstop. And you're kind of the only option I have. You're right. I am both a great and singular option. Sweet! We're gonna make magic. Thank you so much. Oh! Can you add some ranunculus on Table 3, please? On it! Oh, and, uh, don't forget the carnations on 3, please. - Got it! - Thank you! And I need, uh... Roses for the sweetheart table? I noticed it was looking a little light. That's a good catch. I learned from the best! Thank you, partner. You're welcome, teammate. You know, a week ago, I never thought I'd be doing flowers at a wedding, but now that I have, it's not bad! Mr. Flower Guy? Oh! How can I help you, ma'am? My sister decided to give my flowers a haircut, and... Yeah. That's... that's a haircut. You know what? I can help you with that. Perfect! You know, I think it needs a little something. There! See? Nothing a little TLC can't fix. Thank you, Mr. Flower Guy. You're welcome. So, I was, uh, thinking... Do you want to grab a coffee after this? Yeah. I'd love that. Thank you for the pick-me-up. I didn't know how much I needed this. What's wrong? Nothing, nothing. Hey, you did great today. So, what's with the face? Honestly? I don't really like weddings. They kind of bum me out. It's true. You, a professional florist, doesn't like weddings? That's like a baker who doesn't like bread or a clown who doesn't like tiny cars. No, no, I love bread. Tiny cars, not so much. You know, I almost did marry Toni. Yeah, you mentioned that. We made it to our wedding day. Our parents were there, friends were there, guests, everybody. Yikes. I think I see where this is going. You do? Did she ditch you for her ex, the moment when they ask, "Does anyone have any objection?" That's a super common occurrence, isn't it? Yeah, it is, but no. Although, that would have been perfect. So what happened? Well, we got into this huge fight before walking down the aisle. I'm talking seismic. She accused me of not being able to change. I accused her of always putting herself first. What caused the fight? We couldn't agree which one of us was gonna say "I do" first. I can see how that would be a deal breaker. Mm-hmm. And right then and there, the wedding was off. I guess the big question is, did you at least get your venue deposit back? I'm just looking for a bright side. Our whole relationship was based on competition. It turns out our biggest competition was each other. I get it. You want a partner, not a competitor. Mm-hmm. Break-ups are hard, even if it's for the right reasons. I'm sorry. It's fine. I learned my lesson. Never mix work with romance or flowers with romance or anything, really, with romance. What about friendship and football? - Huh? - Feel like showing off? Oh! Oh no, you don't want that. I almost turned pro. I think I can handle it. OK, well, let's see what you got. Hey, kid! Can we play? All right, superstar!

What's going on? Just taking a break before I meet Aaron at the shop to practice. The qualifier is tomorrow. I know. You excited? I am! And terrified. But determined. It's a whole stew of emotions going on inside me. I get what you're going through. I felt the exact same way the night before my first competition. But you know what? It's gonna be great. I have faith in you. And I think you should have faith in yourself. Thanks, Dad. I think I'm starting to. It's been real lonely since your mom passed away. I know. All this stuff, this flower arranging, competing, it just feels like I found a way to connect with her, you know, even though she's not with us anymore. You know, you are so much like her. Please! Mom was a free spirit, an artist. She did what she wanted when she wanted. She was so happy. What, you're not happy? I don't know. It feels like since she died, life just hasn't had the same... Color. Yeah, exactly. I tried to fill the hole with work, but it just... I still feel this... emptiness. It's hard to make a life out of something we don't feel 100% about. But, for what it's worth, I haven't seen you thriving like this in a long time. - Dad... - Yeah? Thanks for fracturing your arm. Yeah, well, glad I could help out. Just, uh, there's only so many bones I can spare, all right? Look, no matter what happens tomorrow, just know that I love you and I couldn't be happier to have you as a daughter. Thanks, Dad. I love you too. Plus, your mom would be super thrilled to know that you and Aaron are an item. What? He's not my boyfriend! Oh my! You sound like you're 14! I'll do the mac and cheese and a Reuben. You're working with Aaron, right? On the flower thing? It's the Botanic Cup. Yeah, it's the flower thing. Why? A little word of advice: Aaron's a great guy. He's funny, he's passionate. He's the star pitcher of our neighborhood kickball team. He never mentioned that! But there's one thing he just flat out hates more than anything. What is it? Sauerkraut. OK, so, hold off on the Reuben. Smart move. He is, however, partial to a cheesesteak, extra grilled onions. I'll take one of those. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Ann Keller. Why won't you come together with an awe-inspiring sense of wonder? You doing OK? Yeah, totally completely fine. That's a lie. I've never been so nervous and excited at the same time. Not even when you got proposed to? Oh yeah, which is probably a good indication that relationship wasn't build to last. - Probably. - There's just so much pressure. You know? What if I let my dad down? What if I let myself down? No, you won't. Trust me. I get very nauseous if I can't predict a foreseeable outcome. I used to feel the same way before big games, going over everything that could go wrong, psyching myself out. Thing is, if you think about failing too much, then it leads to failure. It's a vicious circle. And you are not going to fail. In fact, I can prove it. May I? - Mm-hmm. - OK. I will make you a deal, right now. Don't be scared. All right. Veronicas, of course. Eucalyptus. And a touch of ruscus. OK, OK, OK. It needs one final thing. Garden roses and peonies. So, the deal is, if you can make an arrangement right now with this set of flowers, I will show you something that I've never shown anyone before. In a fun way or an, "Ann's gonna end up the subject of a true crime podcast", kind of way? Definitely the former. Intriguing. So, do we have a deal? Deal. All right!

You and I, we're gonna kick butt tomorrow. Yes, we are. Um, excuse me? Yeah? I believe I was promised a reveal so shocking, it would make my head spin, and then explode from sheer awesomeness. I'm not sure I promised all that. That's how I heard it, so... OK. Uh, well, I guess it's now or never. Um, follow me. I want you to meet Rachel. This is Rachel. Um, what? She's an epiphyllum oxypetalum, more commonly known as "queen of the night." So, you've been talking to your giant plant this whole time? She's a cactus. The queen of the night is one of the hardest plants to grow on earth. She only blooms at night for a few minutes, and then the flowers die off. She sounds like a real drama queen. No, no, no! Listen, if you see these buds, it means that she's about to bloom. That's why I've been checking on her. So, why did you name your cactus Rachel? I don't know. She looks like a Rachel. Huh. Hey, I mean, she's really hard to flower, all right? That's why I don't want to miss the bloom. It's like the floral equivalent of a meteor shower. That sounds incredible. It does! But why do you talk to it? Because plants like being taken care of. You know, they respond to touching and talking and even singing. Please, let me watch you sing to it. No, no, no, no. Listen, flowers are like people. They thrive on positivity and love. I think it's sweet how much you care about Rachel. - Yeah. - I do. And I'm honored that I'm the first person you've introduced her to. Well, it's my pleasure. Wow! This is really happening. Told you this is a big deal. Oh, before I forget, I got you something. For me? Oh! Team Rose Bowl? I made it. I made one for myself too. We're gonna do great. Sure hope you brought your A game, Aaron. Oh, but of course! You like my new partner? Wow! Claudio here is the best and most handsome florist Argentina has to offer. Isn't that right, Claudio? We met at a conference in Buenos Aires last month. One thing led to the other, and, well... I'm happy I upgraded. Best of luck to you both! - Apparently, he doesn't talk. - Yikes. - Real question. - Yeah. Is she a wizard? Is that how she keeps popping up whenever we least expect her? You know what? Forget about her. She's just trying to get in our heads. - Let's do this. - Let's do it. Welcome to the annual Botanic Cup. You are some of the best floral designers from around this state, and you've more than earned your places here. Our rules are simple. Teams of two will work in tandem to create the assigned floral arrangement: a vertical modern arrangement with movement. Everyone will have access to the same materials and floral elements and are allowed to use as many or as few of them as they see fit. You'll have one hour to create your arrangement. The top two arrangements from this heat will move onto final competition. We'll begin in a few minutes. Good luck and good arranging! All right. You good? I have giant knots in my stomach, but I'm fine. I also am very hungry, 'cause I didn't eat breakfast 'cause I was too nervous, but... That feeling is normal. It's passion. I get it every time I compete. My heart feels like a hummingbird drank coffee. Is that normal? Yeah. That's part of it. But we're gonna do great, 'cause we're a team. Yes, we are. Three, two, one, begin! So I'm thinking we do a trumpet vase with a climbing vertical twist, create a sculpture of the foliage to anchor the movement. It'll be like a floral crescendo. And maybe... Some red anthuriums to add pops of color? Yeah, that's a great idea. - Oh, oh! I'm so sorry, Aaron! - No, it's all right. It's all in my head. Just go grab the flowers. OK, sorry. - Is this the right size? - It's perfect. Two more... OK, Toni. It's good, but I still feel like it's missing something. - I think you're right. - Uh, pincushions or gerbera? - I don't know. - What? I gotta finish. It's your call. Seriously? Oh no. Gerbera could add nice texture, but does it compete with the spider orchid? Then again, the gerbera is a bit out of place, basic. Pruners down, people. I'm sorry, Aaron, if I cost us the competition. Hey, no, no, no. You did great. I'm proud of you. Your attention, please! Our winners are... Toni Greer and Claudio, um... It's a mononym. Like Aristotle or Cher. Ah! How wonderful. Congratulations! And our runners up are Aaron Blum and Ann Keller! - That's us! - Yes! Congratulations! - I told you! We did it! - But I screwed up. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough for us to move on. And that's a win. Annie, I am so proud of you. - But I got second place. - So? You're moving on! - That's what I said! - Bam! This is amazing. I'm gonna go talk to the judge before she leaves. Listen, we are still in the game. I feel like I owe you one. How do you propose you pay me back? Well, I guess I could buy us dinner. I know just the place. It was exhilarating! Wasn't it? I see how you got into it. It's crazy, 'cause it feels even better than catching the winning touchdown. Fewer 300-pound giants trying to tackle you, for one. Exactly. I wanted to thank you. For what? I almost cost us the competition. You did all the hard work. I haven't allowed myself to open up to anybody since I broke up with Toni. You know, I hid behind work and the competition, basically convincing myself that I was happy on my own. But spending this time with you, well, it's just really nice working with someone I trust. Well, I'm glad I've moved up from nuisance newbie to trusted teammate. This week has been pretty great for me too. Cheers to that. To new beginnings. New beginnings. Any room left for dessert? I don't know. What you got? Our world-famous bread pudding and our locally famous cheesecake. Well, why don't we let the lady decide? Uh, bread pudding is delicious. But cheesecake is the second most popular dessert amongst women in my demographic. We'll take both. Oh. I like where your head is at. I figured we deserved it. Oh, I... I didn't notice the time. I gotta go. I should check on Rachel. Do you want to maybe swing by the shop tomorrow? Get some practice rounds in before the finals? Yeah. Totally. I can't wait. All right, cool. Have a good night. Sorry about that. - Can you put that on my tab? - Yeah. Well, more for you, then. Enjoy. Thanks. Ann. It's 10:00 at night. I know I'm a workaholic, but why... I know who you should promote. Me. Oh! I didn't realize that was an option. I didn't either until this week. But I know I'm the right candidate for the job. I'd be more than an asset in the field. I would be a rock star. I'm quick on my feet. I'm able to analyze complex situations in an instant. I'm somewhat cool under pressure. I started this week not knowing anything about flower arranging, and now I'm competing for the state title. Wait, what, flowers? I thought you went home to help your dad. What do you say, Mr. Mann? Are you ready to make the best decision of your life? I'm sorry, Ann. Sorry that I didn't consider you sooner. The job is yours! Great! I'll be there first thing Monday morning. But first, I have flowers to arrange. Why do you keep saying "flowers"? Ann? Doing a late-night study session? Toni... Ann was right. Real magic vibes. Shouldn't you be getting ready for tomorrow instead of making my life miserable? Why not both? Come on, Toni, enough. Go home. You'll have your chance to lose to me with grace tomorrow. I won't be the one losing, Aaron. You will. Just like you lost the finals last year. Just like you lost me. - I didn't lose you. - You most certainly did. But it doesn't matter. Tomorrow, when I'm holding that cup, watching you and what's-her-face wallow in the shame of a second-place finish, I'm gonna feel a little bit better about you ruining our wedding day. You know what? I'm sorry. You're apologizing? I really am sorry for the wedding. We both said stupid stuff, and it was unfair to put ourselves in that position on our wedding day. But listen, I've moved on. And I think you should too. 'Cause frankly, I don't know what more you want from me. I suppose we'll have to settle this tomorrow. Good night, Aaron. Rachel... No, no, no, no, no, Rach... Rachel! No! ♪♪♪ Morning, good morning, rise and shine ♪ Good morning! ♪ Today is the day I make you mine ♪ Hey! Who is this fun vibrant, vivacious woman, and what did she do to my best friend, Ann Keller? I'm still the same old me. The Ann I know isn't the bon vivant of her hometown. OK, maybe I've changed a little bit. And I couldn't be happier for you. It's been a good week. A really good week. And it'll be so much better after you win this afternoon. Baby steps. I still have to meet Aaron and go over the game plan. Maybe grab him some breakfast? The way to a man's heart is through his stomach. The way to Aaron's heart is through painstakingly arranged peonies. Fine. Don't listen to me. Oh! I'm headed out to meet the aloe vera guy before your competition. Morris is a doll. I'm so glad I could connect you guys. Seriously, you've been in Franklin Heights one week? And you're getting to know the locals, fixing problems for farmers, partnering up with the most handsome guy in town. Getting a job I deserve. No way! I called my boss last night! I did what you said. I stood up for myself and got what I wanted. - Ann, I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. Oh, that's amazing. Now all I have to do is win the Botanic Cup, and it will literally be a perfect week. Yes. OK, I should go meet Aaron at the shop. I'll see you at 2:00? Wouldn't miss it for the world. Hey, partner! I've got big news. Guess who's got two thumbs, mild iron deficiency and her dream job? This gal! Aaron? Aaron? Are you OK? What happened to Rachel? I missed it. Every night at the same time, I come to check to see if she's bloomed, but last night, I ran into Toni after dinner, and I got here too late. The one night Rachel finally decided to bloom. I'm so sorry, Aaron. Is there anything I can do? No. Come on, let's go practice. We got a competition to win. Just give me a minute? All right. Practice assignment is a bar arrangement using at least 3 floral elements. OK, how about we start with a base of salix tortuosa to give it some height? Yeah. And then we could stud it with some lupine and veronicas to make it pop. Mm-hmm. Are you OK? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Let's just get this started. OK, can I get an accordion leaf please? Thank you. Watch it. I'm sorry. Can I get the pin, please? - Here you go. - Thank you. Green hydrangea will give it nice texture. Pair it with a dahlia? Or is that too cliché? Ann, come on. We gotta go. No. Eucalyptus. It still feels like it's missing something, some element. Tulips or orchids, which one? I don't know. We got hung up here last time. When we compete, you gotta be decisive. I can't. Just choose one! Don't set me up to fail! I know you are upset because you feel like you missed out on something, but you have to snap out of it. If you don't get it together for finals, we'll lose. You just don't want to disappoint Tom. This isn't about my dad. This is about me. I have never had a chance to win something because I don't put myself in a position to win. But now I'm here, and I'm open to trying, and I need you to try with me. I am trying! That's why I'm pushing. I know you got it in you to win. I don't need to be pushed. I need to be encouraged. I am encouraging you, Ann. If you don't meet me halfway, we can't compete together. Ann... Ann! Hey, kiddo. You OK? What's the matter? Aaron and I got into a huge fight, and I don't know if we're gonna compete and everything is ruined. I'm sorry, Dad. I don't think I can do it. I know how much winning the competition meant to you. Aaron and I are like peanut butter and gravy. We're not compatible. All right, all right. Look, so you had a bit of a setback. So what? I've seen how much you've grown this week. Your mom would be so proud. You think so? I know so. You stepped in and are competing in the biggest competition in the state. It's so out of your comfort zone. She'd be thrilled. And it's exactly what she would have done. - It's scary. - I know. But that's good. Change is scary. But the only way to really figure yourself out is being able to change. Your mom and I changed course dozens of times in our life. And I wouldn't have it any other way. That's how we had you. You and Aaron make a great team. I guess. I know you guys are going through a bit of a rough patch, but I've seen how much you care about him. And I know how much he cares about you. When the two of you are working together and in synch, anything is possible, nothing can stop you. Thanks, Dad. You know what this calls for, right? Ice cream. Ice cream would work. - All right, I'll get it. - No, I'll get it. Your arm is in a cast. It's what I'm here for, isn't it? I won't argue with you there. You know, I just don't get it, Dale. Why does it have to be so hard? People react differently to adversity, Aaron. There's no one right way. Yeah, but she's capable of so much. I just wish that she could see that in herself. Sounds like you really care about that girl. Yeah, of course, I do. - Wow. - You're a good guy, Aaron. But you're one of the most guarded people I ever met. Come on, man. I'm not. All right, you might be onto something. You got these walls up that you never let anyone peek over. I know you had a hard time trusting people after you and Toni broke up. But you shouldn't be afraid of your feelings. Yeah, but what if I messed up? What if she doesn't want to be with me after how much of a jerk I was? Show her you can admit that you were wrong, that you can be the person she needs. You're right. I know what I gotta do. Thanks so much, D. Ann! Ann! You were right. I shouldn't have pushed you. I should have encouraged you. I don't yell at my plants and tell them to grow. I sing to them. I talk to them. I encourage them. I still haven't heard you sing. I missed out on so many things in my life. The Rose Bowl, Rachel blooming... this teen Jeopardy tournament thing. Wait, I don't know that story. The point is I'm not gonna miss out on you. And I'm sorry that I couldn't be the person you needed me to be before, but I'm gonna try real hard, because I... I want this, with you. I believe you. And I believe in myself. So let's go win this thing. - Team Rose Bowl? - Team Rose Bowl. Today's competition will decide our champion. Our finalists are Aaron Blum and Ann Keller. And Toni Greer and Claudio no last name given. You'll each have one hour to complete your arrangement. Your final arrangement will be a centerpiece that harmonizes contrasting elements. Three, two, one, begin! So how about... What about a mitsumata structure? We'll, uh, stud it with ranunculus, and then pink roses in different shades to give it that ombre effect. OK. And maybe some dark purple calla lilies to get a touch of drama. And then... suspended cymbidium orchids to transition from light to dark. You got it. - Let's get to work. - All right. So are these good? Something's not working. It's not working. - Higher, higher. - I'm trying. OK, wait. Just... - Fine, OK. - Focus. It's fine, it's fine. I said red, you beautiful dolt. No one speaks to Claudio that way. OK, so what are we gonna do to take this over the top? Uh... Mom's favorite. Hey, 8 seconds. Oh no! OK... I can't get it. Oh! Time! Pruners down, please. You know what? You were absolutely right. This ties the whole thing together. Well, you know, split-second decisions under incredible pressure are kind of my thing now. Thank you all for competing. You've created wonderful works of floral art, but in the end, only one of you can be crowned champion. And the winners of this year's Botanic Cup are... Aaron Blum and Ann Keller! Yes! Yes! I knew they could do it. We did it. Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you so much. You deserve this. Oh, congrats, girl! Oh! You did it, Annie! No, you did it, Dad. For you. A week ago, I did not think that this would be my life. You took humongous risks. Competing in the Botanic Cup, going after this promotion you wanted. I still haven't taken the biggest risk yet. What's that? Yeah, that was definitely worth the risk. Yeah? Yeah, I... I don't know, Tom. I think it's missing something. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Uh, what about a couple of carnations? - Oh, let's see that. - Try that. Let's see, let's see. Ah, no, we're still not there. We... we may need a second opinion. Texture. Have you tried seeded eucalyptus? "I'm vibrant and wonderful, but also down to earth." Eucalyptus says all that? It's the globe-trotting girl. Still got it, Annie. Here. I'll finish these inside. - Thank you. Welcome home. - Thank you. How was your business trip to Tulum? Very succulent. - Is this for me? - It's a dragon fruit cactus. I thought it'd be a good companion plant to Rachel, since they both bloom at night. You like it? I love it. And when she does decide to bloom, we can watch it together.
