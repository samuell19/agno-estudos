Since the Mercy Falls Hospital, ironically only a short distance from the scene of the accident, is on the point of closing down, all the injured are having to be accommodated in the Saint James'Hospital, in the centre of the island. There is concern this may overload the facilities, since the number of injured already stands at 35. This figure could rise considerably, as rescue works continue around the clock. It is rumored that the death toll could be as high as ten, but as yet the official authorities have not issued an official bulletin confirming either the number of victims or the possible causes of this terrible accident, by far the most tragic in the history of the island. A first appraisal by rail experts seems to indicate that there was no obstruction on the tracks or fault with the rails, which puts human error high on the list of possible causes. However, since the engineer is one of the fatal victims, this will only be determined after a thorough investigation is been carried out. The island's chief industry being tourism, it is feared that many of the victims may be foreign visitors... Susan. What are you doing up? She's coming. I told you I didn't want to talk about that any more. But I can feel it. Get back to bed. This is our last night. We'll all have left by tomorrow. Come on. - It hurts. - We're gonna get you better. What happened? I don't know. He suddenly started screaming. Something's wrong, that's for sure. I told you there's something weird here. - Why won't anyone listen? - Susan, please. One, two, three... All right, very still, just for a second, good boy. You're sure he didn't fall out of bed? Of course I'm sure. If he had, I'd have found him on the floor. All right. Go. Good boy, that's great, you're being a very brave man. Now we just need to do the same again, all right? Now, it's important you tell us how this happened, OK? I don't know. No? All right. He's no idea, or so he says. Ah Christ! - This doesn't make sense! - No. It doesn't. I told you! It's all right. All right, Simon. Very still. Miss Nichols! - Hi. - Amy? - Yeah. - Welcome to the island. - Thank you. - I'm Roy. Sorry I'm late. I had to pick this up. If you don't mind taking that actually - and I'll take that. - Sure. - Did you have a good trip? - Yeah. They didn't tell me you were American. Been in England long? It's a long story. I've got a film in the case for the kids. I get them sent over from this guy over in Manchester once a week. They're the real deal, you know, not some old videotape. - Do you like them? - Yeah, I suppose, if they're good. Get ready for a long drive. Mercy Falls is up North, pretty out of the way. Well, I guess it doesn't really matter now anyway. Actually we should have closed down already a couple of days ago. Most of the kids have already moved to St. James's in the centre of the island. But what with the train crash and everything, they've run out of beds so we've got no option but to wait. Mrs. Folder will put you in the picture. She's our Senior Nursing Officer. I'm sorry about the short notice. One of our staff took unexpected sick leave two nights ago and I honestly didn't think we'd have to replace her. But, as you can see, we're still here. - Roy has brought you up to date. - Yeah, more or less. Anyway, I hope it'll only be for a few days. You can see for yourself, we only have a skeleton staff. It's not a comfortable situation for any of us. The remaining children are upstairs. The whole floor's practically been dismantled. We've only left the bare necessities. If you need to make a call, you'll have to use your mobile. The phones were cut off yesterday. - Where do you want these? - Over there, I'll be right down. No button for the second floor. Have they cleared it out already? There wouldn't be much point in that. It's been closed off since 1959. If they didn't clear it then, I don't see the point in bothering now. It's been disconnected ever since. Miss P?rez, this is Miss Nichols. She'll be taking over the night shift until we close. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi. Miss P?rez will fill you in with what's going on. - Put her in room seven. - OK. I'm needed downstairs. If you'll excuse me. - Call me Helen. - Amy. I'll show you around. There's actually not much left to see. Yeah, that's what they told me. This is the playroom. As you can see, they've plenty to keep them occupied so they're usually not much trouble. In fact, they are especially quiet today. - Why? - Visiting day. Their parents have just left. - How many children are still here? - Just eight. Lung cases. I'll fill you in later. I'd like to look at the case-studies before I start working. Relax, there's plenty of time for that. Come on, I want you to meet the kids. Children, pay attention. I want you to meet Amy. She's going to be your night nurse until we leave. Hi. - Where's Susan? - Susan had to go, sweetie. How are you? We're sick. What's your name? Maggie. Reynolds. Did you see your parents today? I haven't got any. Me neither. These blocks must be a lot of fun to keep you playing all by yourself. They're not for playing with. What are they for then? Talking. To who? OK, time to clear away. Dinner'll be here in 5 minutes. - I don't want to tell you twice. - See you later, Maggie. And you, put those back where they belong. I'm fed up of finding blocks all over the place. We put them all in here so the other rooms could be cleared out. They get rowdy now and then, but it actually makes life easier. This is David. - Hi, David. - Hi. And this is Richard. He's been on the respirator for 3 weeks. But he's getting better every day, - aren't you Richard? - How often does it have to be checked? Once in a while. It's automatically controlled. No need to be overly worried. - Helen, give us a hand, will you? - You were keen to get stuck in. All yours. Now, on three, OK? One, two, three... There we go. - I'm Amy, the new night nurse. - Yes, I know. Now you just get some rest, yeah? Helen, Simon's got to go to London tomorrow for some tests so have him ready straight after lunch. - Welcome, Amy. - Thank you. So what happened to you? Simon broke his leg the other night. But he's doing fine now. How did that happen? Good question. Another forty seconds. Did anyone hear me say "time's up"? - That girl drives me up the wall. - Who? Maggie. I see you found them. They should keep you busy for a while. Yeah. Matt. Lights out in 5 minutes. OK. If you need anything, Matt's downstairs all night. And Robert should be here in a minute. He's the night doctor. I'm sure you two'll make a good team. - Well, I'm off. Good luck. - Thanks. Maggie, - what are you doing awake? - I can't sleep. It's pretty. When I was a little girl I used to have one too. Do you know what I used to call it? Mister Sleepy. Because it used to help me go to sleep. So come on now... Charlotte... Sorry? The blocks. They're for talking to Charlotte. - Who's Charlotte? - I think she's a girl. Can't she talk? No. She's different. She's... mechanical. Oh, a mechanical girl! - What do you talk about? - Nothing. She hardly ever talks now. Oh, well, then maybe we should go and see her. Do you know where she is? Upstairs. I didn't think anybody could live upstairs. I'll tell you what. If this Charlotte comes back, you and I can have a word with her, OK? OK. Good night. Shit. It's OK, everyone back to bed, let's go. Let's go, honey, it's OK. - Richard darling, it's OK. - What was it? I don't know, it was the pipes or something. It was her. I told you. She's angry. I've been trying to call you for the last ten minutes. - Something wrong? - I don't know. I heard something and I thought maybe you heard it too. - No, nothing. - Really? OK. So what am I supposed to have heard? I don't know, it sounded like it was coming from the second floor. - The second floor? - It scared me and the children. This is an old building. The ceiling's full of ventilation pipes. You'll get used to it. - I can call Dr. Kerry if you like. - No. It's OK. Oh, cool. Hey you lot, steady on, don't push. Do we get to ride the helicopter? I'm afraid not. Hey Amy, how's it going? I'm showing that film to the kids tonight. It's the last one, so it's gonna be pretty special. Hope you can join us. Yeah, I'll be there. Something the matter, Amy? - I'm a little worried, I guess. - Worried already? You just got here. It's one of the little girls. She's obsessed with the idea that somebody's living upstairs. Ah, don't tell me. Charlotte again, right? Hey, don't let it get to you. It's not the first time. Listen, I've been here for donkey's years, and there's always been some kid who's sworn they've seen her. She's practically an urban legend. Don't worry about it too much. I'll see you later. I don't care about the helicopter, I just want to leave, today. You're going to have to wait a bit longer. Be patient, OK? - She's scared. - No, I'm not! Don't be silly. What's there to be scared of? - Last night. - Why? What happened? Nothing. The pipes went crazy and we all got a little scared, that's all. - Feeling more relaxed? - Yeah. Maggie and I are getting to know each other a little. You know, be careful with that girl. She can be a bit... difficult. Anyway, now you're here, do you mind taking over for a second? - Sure. - Thanks. Hey, Simon, let's get your coat on. It's freezing. We ready to roll? Yeah, almost we're ready to roll. You must be Amy. Dr. Kerry. Robert. - Hi. - Hi. I thought you had the night shift. Ah, well, I do. But I wasn't going to let Simon here sneak off without saying goodbye. - We're old mates, aren't we? - Yeah. Matt tells me there was a bit of a party here last night. Oh, no, it was nothing. It was... spooked. Well, this place can be a little spooky during the nights but also incredibly boring, so give me a bell next time. - Helen, five minutes. - OK. Children, come and say goodbye to Simon. Have you ever been in a helicopter before? - No. - Me neither. - I'll see you later. - After all I'm not going to the movie. Ah, you won't miss much. It's a load of rubbish. - Yeah. - You cheer up. You get better now. Yeah. Amy! Don't use the nurse's toilet, there's no running water. No shit. Susan, are you alright? No. What's wrong? I don't know. Hey! Roy! Ah, there we go. It's going the wrong way. Don't worry. It'll go back down in a minute. Roy! Simon? What's wrong, Amy? What the hell? I'll go and get the key, OK? You, you stay here. Stay there. - Simon, where's your inhaler? - I want to get out! No, Simon, where's your inhaler? OK, it's OK, Just breathe normally, it's OK. What the fuck? Oh shit! - She wants to hurt me. - What? The mechanical girl. Maggie told me about her. For Christ sake! Don't move! - We're coming up to get you, OK? - Stay there, don't move! Just hang on Amy! Hang on! - What's going on? - Just get Dr. Marcus. - Amy... - No, it's OK. Stay still. Oh my God. Stay calm, Amy. All right? Don't move, Amy. For Christ's sake, don't move. C'mon, downstairs, c'mon! The kids have settled down at last. - I'm sorry. - Nonsense. None of this was your fault. I'm glad it wasn't me. I don't know what I'd have done. I got stuck in a lift once, six whole hours! And my mother was there with me. - If you knew her, she... - Miss P?rez, - go look in on the children. - I just did. Then do it again. You should get some rest. I'll work your shift. No, I'm OK. - Thanks. - OK. As you wish. Some species... Matt? Amy, I know what you've done. What a day, huh? Sorry, did I scare you? What's up? Nothing. Nothing, it doesn't matter, I... What are you doing? Nothing. Need a hand? How are you getting on with the kids? All right? Fine, yeah, everything's going really well. Especially me and Maggie. Yeah, you've really taken a shine to her, haven't you? She's an orphan, isn't she? And cystic fibrosis. Lucky draw. - Yeah... - It's really severe. All we can do is to make it as easy for her as possible. I suppose... the business with Susan didn't exactly help. What do you mean? Maggie was really fond of her and she doesn't make friends easily. I'm feeling a little cold, I'm going to go get a sweater. Maggie! - What are you doing here? - Did you see her? Maggie, not again! We're not going to talk about this any more. But you went up in the lift. You must have seen her. I didn't see her, because there isn't anybody to see. She doesn't exist. Only here. I'm not making it up, Amy. She was the one who hurt Simon. Nobody hurt Simon. So why can't anyone explain what happened? Ask Susan. She'll tell you. Robert, I want you to tell me what happened. To Simon. He fractured his femur. Double fracture. Why? Well, in this X-ray there was one fracture. Just one. This one was taken 3 minutes later. There are two. How do you explain that? Look, we don't know what happened with him. That's why he was under observation and why he's been sent to London. Susan left because she was afraid, didn't she? - Where are you going with this? - Tell me. OK, maybe she did. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. I wanted to talk to Susan. It's all right. Thank you. Forgive her. Are you a friend of Susan's? No. I actually don't know her. I just wanted to talk to her. I work at the hospital. Susan died yesterday. Her car skidded off the road. It's a terrible tragedy. I'm really sorry. You're worried, too, aren't you? Susan was. Ever since she was a little girl she told me all her problems. She trusted me. But lately she'd become evasive. I'd say she was scared about something. Well, Susan told me nothing. Whatever it was, she decided to look for help of another kind. What kind of help? Happy birthday, little princess. It's taken me a long time to find you, but here you are and now that you're 16, the time has come for you to be completely under my spell. Rose... Rose! Don't touch anything! I won't let anyone interfere in keeping her from dying. I can't wait to see your faces when I hand over to you your daughter's body, Rose. Wake up, Rose. Wake up. Good heavens, that's terrible. I had no idea. Why did you go and see her? I don't understand. I wanted to find out what was she so afraid of. What the hell are you talking about? You saw what happened in the lift. - And I've heard things. - Things? You're surely not talking about ghosts? Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to write a letter of condolence to Susan's family. Do you know who Charlotte is? One of the little girls, Maggie talks about... Miss Nichols, Maggie is a very special little girl as I'm sure you've realised. If she wants to let her imagination run away with her, let her do it, but I think you're a little too old for that, don't you? I think somebody needs to take responsibility. Responsibility? Don't make me laugh. Miss Nichols, I know exactly who you are. I'm sure you realise I would not have employed you without first looking up your record. So don't make me regret my decision. OK everybody, did you enjoy it? Right, bedtime now. Come on. All of you. Come on, kids. I can't believe it. Maggie without her Mr. Sleepy! - Do you know what I think? - What? I think the Prince saves her because he's in love. - That's what I think too. - That's why he kisses her. But it has to be a love kiss. A love kiss? Yeah. How do you know when a kiss is a love kiss? 'Cause it's on the mouth. Did Simon come back? Amy! Don't touch her. What's going on? - You can ask the children. - I already have, Amy. And all they saw was you panicking. - It's no wonder they were scared. - Something happened in that room. - Why don't you believe me? - I do, but I'm also sure that there's a reasonable explanation. - Maggie says she's seen her. - Maggie is a kid, all right? Maggie probably has seen her. There was something under that sheet! Amy, you have got to pull yourself together. The kids are fine now. - Unless you need anything else... - No, it's fine, thanks. I'll be downstairs. If you want, I can take over your... They're probably not gonna help. How the hell do you know, you know nothing about me. No, I don't. But I do know what happened to you. Folder told me. And it was a mistake. It was a mistake. Yeah... That's what I should have told... - Come on... ...his mom. That it was a mistake. No, it was fucking negligence, Robert. It was fucking negligence. - Shut the fuck... Don't touch me! - It's a hard job, God knows it's a hard job. And it can be a heartbreaking job. And we're all gonna make mistakes, I've made so many mistakes, but you can't - lug them with you your whole life. - No, please. Please do not tell me how to feel, OK? All I'm saying is that maybe that's what's making you scared, the fact that you're worried about doing something wrong. Listen to me, it's the first time you've been back to work since it happened. It's completely natural you might not be over it yet. Are you suggesting that I've been making all this up? That I have gone completely insane? I am saying that it's possible that you're overprotecting the kids because you're scared. You're scared of yourself, I don't know, I'm trying to figure it out, and believe it or not I'm actually trying to help! Go to hell. It's really pretty. What is it? I'm afraid he won't answer you. Adam is autistic. He often isn't really aware of us. Father Tom rang to say you might call. And it's not like "Doubting Thomas" to push people in our direction. He told me that you had spoke with Susan. Susan came to see us a few weeks ago. Many people do when they're frightened or need answers. But it's not that easy. Do you know what life is, Miss Nichols? It's nothing more than a journey between two worlds. Ours, the world of the living, and the world of those who have died. You see, these two worlds are separate. Those of us in this world cannot see the other, however much we may wish to. It's not for us, not yet. But there are some who, when they are drawing near to the other world, are able to glimpse things in it that have come close to this one. Susan was drawing near. She was dying. That's why she could see. Charlotte... I'm afraid there is something in that hospital from the other world that, for some reason, has come close to ours. Something that doesn't accept or doesn't understand that it has died. Someone who's died in the hospital? It's not where they died. It's not even where they lived. It's much simpler than that. They simply stay near what they loved. That's what keeps them here. Oh, Adam! Well, it seems he was aware of you after all. He's never given anyone a present before. There's someone else who says that she can see her. I know. Susan told us. That little girl needs your love, she really needs it. - She has trouble breathing. - That's right. - Folder was looking for you. - What's wrong? Maggie... Just a minute. That's all right. She's stable now. She had another attack. To be honest, we're used to it by now. Hi. Hi. How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Good. - I parked it outside. - Thanks. - Roy. - Yeah? Do you remember the children you told me about, the ones who used to talk about Charlotte? I need you to do me another favour. Amy... I don't know if this is right. These files are confidential. - I don't care. - OK, well... The ones we're looking for I think... Marvin Jones. That was years ago. He often used to talk about her. I can still remember him. Right little tearaway he was. Died on the operating table. Poor sod. Evelyn Thomas. From back in the eighties. A real angel. A "secret friend" she used to call her. Forget it. Doesn't matter. Amy? Amy, what's going on? I still don't know. Maggie, I'm going to ask you a question. And I need you to tell me the truth. Now you promise? It's about Charlotte... Have you really seen her? We'll be leaving now. - How are the children? - They're with Helen. They don't seem to be aware of anything. So much the better. What about Maggie? She's fine. We took her back to the ward. She'll be more settled with the others. What now? - How are you going to explain this? - Oh, Miss Nichols... This man is dead! And nobody an explain how it happened! - What about Simon? And all the... - Amy... I don't give a damn what you think! We've got to get those children out of here! There is something evil in that hospital. We're all worried about what's happened, we're doing all we can. You'd better get a grip on yourself. Maybe I did make a mistake with you after all. - Jesus Christ! - Amy. - Listen. - What? It's not gonna get better by getting pissed off with everybody. Then what do you want me to do? Stuff myself with pills and pretend as if nothing's happening like the rest of you? Run away, like Susan? No, Robert, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna let those kids down, not this time. I'm not gonna mess up again. Helen. What a pain, huh? You know, it was fine when I left this morning and now look, it's pouring down. All you get here is rain, rain, rain. I wish I'd never left Madrid. I've no umbrella. I've got to walk all the way home and the last thing I feel like is washing this fucking dumb uniform. Helen, for God's sake. Don't you see what's going on? Roy is dead. You knew... - Susan told you, didn't she? - No. - You know, Susan was mad. - No, she wasn't. Stop pretending that nothing is going on. It's not going to help us. Now please. Just cover for me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm fine. Dr. Kerry said I could get up whenever I want. There. - How do you know? - Susan told me. Maggie, you need to go to bed. No please, Maggie, you're still not feeling well. Go. Amy, run. Run! - Get into bed. - Where the hell did you both get to? - Where's Folder? - She went home. - My Mr. Sleepy. - Maggie, please, get into bed. - Amy... - Just stay here. Damn it, Robert, look at her. It's just a photo, Amy. There are a lot of girls called Charlotte. The mechanical girl. Please. There is no Charlotte. Where's Roy's projector? What is this? Osteogenesis imperfecta. Brittle bone disease. It's quite rare. A sort of mutation of the bone tissue that causes it to diminish, the bones become abnormally fragile and extremely prone to fractures. Christ. They certainly didn't know much about it in those days. The treatments were fairly primitive. Oh my God... Tantrums are pretty common in these cases. Pain turns to rage. Robert, I don't know how, but this little girl is still here. - Please... - No, Maggie was telling the truth. She did see her. And so did Susan. That's why she left. All right, so why just them? It doesn't make sense. Susan was going to die. You have to be close to see, and she was. And Maggie... You know. Think about it. Think about everything that's happened. She wants to make everybody suffer the way she did. That's why she breaks things. She is full of rage. - It is happening again. - Amy, this was forty years ago. - So why is it happening now? - I don't know why. But I know that she's here. It's absurd, you can't ask me to believe this... I've seen her too. - What? - She was there. Right before my eyes. Right, let's get out of here. I'll call St. James's. Marcus is there. I'll tell him it's an emergency. They'll come and get us. Oh Christ. I want you upstairs with Helen, and start to get the kids ready. - We're leaving. - What's going on? - Move! Fuck! I can't get a signal. - Fuck! - It must be the storm. - Fuck! Folder lives just down on the beach. - I could use her phone. - No. I'll go. Come on kids, put your coats on! - Are we leaving? - Yep, we are. - Up in the helicopter? - No. Not tonight, Nicholas. - ?Where's Amy? - Maggie? Emma, come here! - Helen... - I'm coming, sweetie. Jimmy! - What the hell is going on? - I don't know. She's getting angry. Richard's hyperventilating. He's gonna need a portable unit. Try in the basement. I think there's still some equipment down there. - I'll be back in a minute. - I'm going to take this out. What are you doing here? - Why aren't you with the children? - We have to get them out of there. You have to call St. James's and tell them to come, now! Have you gone insane? Please... OK. It's only the needle that's broken. I'll get it out. Don't panic. Get back! Get back, I said! We've got it! It's the glass girl. You should have worked it out. - You should have listened to me. - How did you expect me to? It's all so absurd. I had just arrived when it happened. It was a scandal. - What the hell are you talking about? - Her nurse... They brought her in to take care of the girl. - What happened? - I don't know exactly. The girl had started to improve. The doctors were going to send her to another hospital, but she had a sudden relapse. It baffled everyone until they found out. What? The nurse was accused of provoking the child's fractures. She didn't want her to be taken away, she'd become obsessed with her. An inquiry was conducted and she was fired. She couldn't bear the idea of being separated from the children. - And then it happened. - What did she do? She suffocated her. She put on the orthopedic limbs and she threw herself into the lift shaft. You can't imagine the uproar. At one point they were going to close down the hospital. Eventually they just shut off the second floor and it was all forgotten. Come on, come on! Fuck! Helen? - Where have you been? - Is everybody ready to go? Richard. Matt went to the basement looking for a portable breathing unit. Please, stay with Richard. Robert? Where's Robert? I don't know! I don't know where Robert is. I don't know where you were. I don't know where anybody was. Just get the children out. And stay together. Matt? - Amy. - Robert, where were you? It's not her. The girl's name was Mandy Phillips. It's all there. Her nurse was called Charlotte Rivers. She's different. She's mechanical. They simply stay near what they loved. That's why it's started now. Why? She was causing the girl's fractures so they wouldn't take her away. She's doing the same thing again. She's been here all these years because she needs the children. Come on, let's go. It started when they were being transferred. Let's go! Helen! What? OK. It's gonna be OK. - She won't let them leave. - We've got to keep them here. Come on. Quick, run! - Helen, no! - What? - Go back! - Get them back here! - We need to get out of here. - Helen, you have to trust us. - We might be wrong about this. - No! We received an emergency call and we're going to evacuate. Robert, do something! You can't take these kids out of here! No! I'm the responsible pediatrician and I'm telling you these kids are in grave danger. - The oxygen pump, where? - It's through here. Wait a minute. Why isn't anything happening? I don't know. I don't get it. Maybe it's okay. I'll take him now. Come on... Dr. Kerry, please. Where's Maggie? I can't find her. Helen. Where's Maggie? Helen, where is Maggie? She wanted her blanket. Oh my God. - Upstairs! - What? That's why she's not doing anything. She's got Maggie. Maggie! Amy! Amy! I wanted Mr. Sleepy. It's OK, angel, don't worry, we're gonna... No! - She's not going to let me go... - It's OK. It's OK, Maggie. Don't move. No, no, it's going to be OK. Listen to me very carefully, you're going to have to stay here now. It's OK, honey. She's going to take very good care of you, - she's very kind. - No. Amy, please! You'll be very happy here. Hold on to Mr. Sleepy. As tight as you can. We found a male nurse in the basement. He presents multiple serious body fractures. He's still alive. Maggie... Maggie... No, please... Amy! No! She's... She's dead! I'll send someone up to help you. It doesn't matter. It's over now. The children... are gone. There's nothing to keep her here. She's gone. I saw her. I'm going to die. I don't care what you saw. I'm going to get you out of here, OK? She's lost a lot of blood. We need three units. She's not breathing. I have to defib. Ready? - Let's go. - We're losing her. Charging two hundred. Clear, please! Jesus Christ! Three sixty and clear please. Fuck. Right, CPR. Come on Amy! Come on Amy! Come on, Amy! Come back! It's useless. Ah Christ. Charging three sixty again. And, clear please. - Goddammit! - She's dead. Fuck. Charging three sixty again please, and clear. Come on Amy! Charging again at three sixty. - Let it go. - Goddammit! Let's go. Charging three sixty again... Do you know what I think? I think the Princess needs a kiss to be saved. A love kiss. Charging three sixty and, clear please. Amy! How are you feeling? You've got some visitors. We saw the report on the television.
