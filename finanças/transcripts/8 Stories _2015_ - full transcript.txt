In a city full of people we can never feel alone, or so I've heard. Millions of people living in one place talking together, laughing, crying together, rushing down streets powdered with snow. We're fascinated with the stories and songs that help us see into each other's lives. So why is it that we can't talk to each other? What makes us so cold? Thinking back to Christmas from my childhood I remember going into the icy wind to sing carols. We'd give cards with messages of love and plates of warm cookies. We took care of each other. Her doors were always open. Somehow that all changed. We keep our doors closed now. We sit in our homes and do our own things. The people I live with are faces lost in the crowd, strangers. I only know them by the footsteps on my ceiling and the voices down the hall. They push the same buttons to reach the same floors, we share the same space. I'd never knew they were my neighbor. I had forgotten what a neighbor was. Out, I'm mopping. Unbelievable.

Like some stupid cheerleader's gonna pay any attention to the game. She'll be all over me no matter what I do. What? Your mom likes me. Shut up man. No, no, I'd love to get ice cream with you afterwards. Yeah, mmhm, oh yeah, rocky road, as always. Mmhm, oh you're gonna love this. I'm really excited. Mmhm, oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'm gone. I'm in the cab now. I should be there in about two hours. Love ya. No, love you more. Love you more. Yeah... I gotta go, bye. Got it. How's your morning? Good. Good. You? Yeah, good. Good. You can't depend on them. They're dead weight. I don't care if we like him. We need somebody who works. Yeah, I'll be there in like 20. Pick me one up too. Make sure it isn't watered down. Today's gonna be a long day. Yes, we're losing money. Money, okay? Cha-ching, jing-a-ling. Alright, money's time. We're wasting it. I'm serious. Are you serious? Alright. Oh, hey tell Ariel I miss her beautiful face. Sounds like a date. Uh huh. Ryan! It's been too long. Lunch? Today? How about that? I'd have to look at my schedule. I'm really busy. I've been on a lot of dates. Oh you haven't heard? Yes I'm having an incredible time. I'm free. Now you really wanna hang out? Oh yes you are. Hey, Scary! Excuse me. Shh... It's okay now Otto. Sorry. Hey, oh my body... Excuse me. Floor please. Thanks. Muffin, no! Stop it! We are taking the stairs for your punishment. Stupid dog. Hey man, I gotta go back to my apartment. I forgot something. What was it, your homework? Dude, forget it. Just take the zero. You don't know Miss Pennywinkle, she'll kill me. Oh Pennywinkle, death by Pennywinkle! You've got to be kidding me. No, no, no, no, no. What? I can't be here right now. This can't be happening. Dude, this guy smells like Alka Seltzer and baked beans. Stop smelling him. I'm sure it's fine, it's just stuck. I'm stuck on the elevator with Santa and his gang of merry elves. Help me out here. Hey! Oh shoot... I don't care if half of New York's in a blackout. Yeah we have to get out of here. Quit stuffing your face with donuts and get us out of here! You just made sure we're the last people they're helping. Thanks a lot. So what's the deal? You guys coming to let us out or what? Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Get out of there. You are sorry to hear about that. That's hilarious. Who are you talking to? That better be the electrician. We're stuck in the elevator with scary, the Glee club hobbit It could be worse. We could be in here with B.O. guy. Shut up Tristan. Just give us a couple minutes. This place will stink like a dead man. We're stuck in an elevator with eight people. How hard is this to fix? Okay okay, so what does your manager have to say? Don't push that. Every time you push a button, somebody dies. Sorry, I didn't know. Sorry. I should of took the stairs. I cannot, this is too much! This is really too much and I have a deadline. The stairs? You don't think I can take the stairs? I didn't mean it... I got a bullet in my side in Vietnam, alright? I think I can handle some stairs. Sir, I didn't say you couldn't, sir. Well you had a tone. It was in your eyes. And stop looking at me like you feel sorry for me. Oh I don't feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for me. Figures. Stupid kid. You too! Okay okay. We've got an old guy in here. That should give us some kind of priority, right? He could keel over at any second. Are you crazy? Don't say that. Half of New York's in a blackout. Does anyone have anything that would get us to the top of the priority list? I've got somewhere to be. I'm sorry. I've got an interview in, 30 minutes. Oh, did you lose your job? I'm hiring. Come on people, get us to the top of the rescue list. Someone's got to have something. Cancer. I had a pancreatectomy. They took out half my pancreas. Good. Good, that's good stuff. Medicine? Oh yeah, I'm on my last reservoir, but it should last me about 10 hours in here. Man if we were stuck in here for 10 hours I'd do something I'd regret like, hooking up with you and free falling down the elevator shaft. Can you get someone down here what's your name? What's your name? Still having a good day? I spy with my little eye a kid who's trying to hard to play it cool. We're stuck in here! We're with some real winners. You know what I mean? Okay, somebody really smells in here and I'm not even gonna be able to deal with that. You better stop. I am not gonna survive this. How are you on the phone right now? I spy with my little eye a girl who's pretending to hate someone. Okay, okay. I spy with my little eye someone who wants to die early. Extra points if you figure out how we can do him in. Do you even know who you're dealing with? We're all very important people with important things to do. I will show you how to kiss a girl. Well, some of us. One of us. They're gonna try to get us out of here as fast as they can. How hard is it to push a couple of buttons and get us out of here anyway? What? I can't be stuck in here. I have a deadline. Good thing your job's a joke. I decide to leave the house for the first time this week and this is what happens. What are you missing out on, Jeopardy? Hey Chase, no school! Sick! Oh come on. What are you doing with this? Soccer's in the fall. We've got year round now or they lose us to the academy. Go St. Magnus Stars. St. Magnus Brats. That's all I need. Oh and just throwing this out there, if you're not wearing deodorant, get on it. Scary? Go tigers! Tristan... Okay. This better not mean we're missing the game. Nope, we're getting out of here. It'll be half an hour tops. Don't worry guys. One hour later... Shut up Tristan. Seriously, a gold eye ring? Here we are. Didn't find it? So the things are good right? Unbelievable. You do not know how much hair and lint, and dead skin is on the ground. This floor is filthy. OCD. Misophobia. You're doing homework now? Hey, back off. What are you working on? Hello? Anybody home? Scary! Why do you call her scary? It's Scarlett. Tristan just has a nickname for everyone. Yeah, what's yours? I don't have one. Some friend. Stay in, stay in, stay in, stay in. Hey um, honey, could you spare a scrap of paper. I'll pay you back. Hmm? Really? What's the street value of that, like two cents? I've gotta write my article for Whimsy by 3:00. Editors don't take excuses, even if I am trapped with the devil. Oh hey, yeah I'm gonna be a while. I'm stuck in traffic. Yeah Ariel, I've been meaning to tell you how much you mean to me. How supportive you are. I was wondering if I could thank you over dinner. Yeah. Hey babe! Could you do me a favor? Could you take my pictures from the Statin Island trip and burn them? They just bring up really bad memories, you know? You're my hero Ryan. Love ya. What was that? Let me think. What have I been holding for the last half hour, and makes a clinking sound when it falls? It's a riddle. I've got it. It's a collection of Matlock DVDs. A squad of cheerleaders? Plastic? Oh, maybe? No, it's a rescue squad, come to save me from insanity. How about drugs? You're familiar with these, right? Yeah, we dope up everyday. You sit around in your room playing video games everyday. Yep we're real busy hacking government secrets. Okay, okay. Alright everybody, we're gonna make use of this space a little bit more efficiently, okay? What? So just shift over. Yeah you. Yeah you soccer brat. Kid with the hair. Let's just move it on over. Shift it over. Shift it over. C'mon just scoot over man. Let's you know, I'm sick of breathing your air. Yeah, now everyone gets their space. We're all gonna get through this alive. Just everyone is gonna be okay. Okay. You can't talk to her or you won't? In my day, a man went courting. I'm sorry, we don't really know what girls are. We can't afford a girl to nerf our XP. We're only six quests from getting capped in Battle Realm. Spoiled too. Do your parents let you talk to them that way? I don't know, we don't talk. Oh, you're a poor little rich boy, are you? You're mad that they didn't come to your baseball games, never mind that they paid thousands for them? Soccer, I play soccer. Kids... Judgmental shadows, whining about how you did everything wrong, and mad at you for being human. You know, I was lucky to get food on the table, and it wasn't easy! Yeah I yelled, and I made mistakes but, at least now they're grown and adjusted you know? Now that we don't talk anymore. They'll understand what I did for them when their kids grow up, when I'm dead. Can't take the time to let anyone in? Every morning we ride the elevator together. We smile, avoid eyes. Nobody takes the time to get to know the people we live with. Nobody bothers to say hello. That'll get you murdered. Even worse, a date. I'm being punished. No one else has a name in this big old box besides Scary? Huh? Nothing? Is this your box? Really, again? Really? Okay... Are you serious? Wake me when this is over. I'm Maggie. Maggie? What kind of name is Maggie? You should be Margaret. I knew a Maggie once. She embezzled thousand's from a women's and orphan's fund and gained 400 pounds in prison. Was that you? I'm Ethan, she's Grace. You know my name? You told me way back, when... Wait, you don't remember? Oh boy. Just a great stalker I guess... Ethan, I thought your name was Sammy. What, why? Well you're always talking about playing a Sammy, I just figured you were talking about yourself in third person. Sam's my twin. A twin? Mmhm. That makes so much sense. I just always thought we had the same schedule but when we met up twice in one hour you came from a different direction, I just thought it was too much of a coincidence. I thought you were following me... No, no, no, I'm sorry. Sam's a girl. My twin is a sister. Really. Oh, so it is a coincidence I see you all the time. Oh, okay. Who are you texting? Is it a girl? You are such a loser. Is it Andrea? She thinks you're a jerk. Hi, I'm Chase. I like girls! Leave me alone Tristan. So do you talk? Do you ever stop? Don't talk to Tristan. He'll just insult you. Aw, I didn't hurt your girlfriend's feelings, did I Scary? Scary! Scary, do you have Lyme disease? Kid, you talk anymore and I'm gonna rip off my shoe. I'm not kidding around here. You like Star Trek, don't you? I hear you, the theme music. You live right below me. Sorry. Oh no, no. It's actually great to dance to. Yeah, I can hear that too. Don't worry, it's great to paint to. You're an artist? You talk about yourself in third person. Wait no, your twin. You pull Sammy's and all nighters. You have bad hair days. You like Star Trek, and you get up on the roof sometimes, and you wear Fierce cologne. I can stalk too. Sorry I doubted you. Why do you get up on the roof? Just pulling a Sammy. You know, you can join me whenever you feel like it. Oh holy... You're taking off your face! You're such a child. As you discovered, I'm ancient. I'm not about to wear what I was born with. Think my hair's really this long little boy? Is there anything real about you? Yes, she's as mean as she looks. Do you have a cell phone Scarlett? I could call someone to let them know that you're here, or you could use mine. Why are you bothering? Who's she gonna call, her parents? They probably don't even own a phone. At least they care about me. You're a complete jerk. No one likes you, not your friends, not your mom! Your dad won't see your games. I was beginning to wonder if you were all there. Still am wondering if you are, moron. You have nothing to do but bother the neighbors? If you're bored I'll let you pluck my nostril hairs, okay kid? They should've come for you us by now. Maybe they're all dead. Think about it. Mysterious blackout, elevator's stuck, and no help for hours? We get desperate enough we shimmy up this elevator shaft and find the place overrun by zombies. Jeez... Kidding. I'm kidding. Okay? I need a restroom. Yeah, I had a quart of green smoothie for breakfast. Chase had a dozen donuts and a quart of orange juice. I'm stiff. Are we almost to Grandma's house yet? I am surrounded by insane people. Hey, look what I brought, art! We can all transcend the physical world and forget that we're all stuck in an elevator together. What? What is this modern art crap? Go ahead, guess what you're looking at. It's supposed to reveal something about your psyche. Oh great, your a new ageist. A what? A hippie. This one's called Darkness Falls. Sounds like a bad breakup. Sounds like zombies. I knew it was a zombie day the moment I woke up. It was quiet, the apartment was empty, to think I almost escaped New York in time. You almost escaped? Is it a bear? What are you blind? It's upside down. It's a mass murder. Look at all the blood. That's stupid. Someday we're gonna read about how some crazed rich kid did away with his entire apartment complex. Hah, you're right. Whatever that is, is dead. What was it? Nothing, I just spilled some paint. I didn't expect it to work so well. Here. Let me show you a real one. I didn't inspire that, did I? You do get a little loud sometimes. That makes me your muse. You just use me for my body. Whoa, Tristan, what if he wakes up? This is great. Dude, look at this. You do that one more time, I'll kick you down the shaft. Oh no, Tristan. Tickle his feet with it too. Give it to me. Figures. What are you looking at? Pathetic. I know I should've taken the stairs. I could've been asleep in my lazy boy in front of better shows than this. Three hours later. Shut up! Up, you can't end your sentences with a preposition. My dad would have a fit. Shut up, your mouths. That's it! This is not how I wanted to spend my morning. And this is how I wanted to spend mine? Hello, please leave a message... An answering machine. Hi, we want to get out of the elevator. Right everyone? The children are hungry, and annoying. I'm hungry. The old man needs to use the bathroom. The cake and the green smoothie isn't tying you over? No. I had some grapes, and Chase didn't even share one donut with me. The kid is living off grapes as his only sustenance. Tell them I have a deadline. Why haven't they come yet? Please sir, for the sake of the children and the dying kid and the elderly. It is crucial I meet my deadline. My editor is not gonna believe I got stuck in an elevator. Tell... That should do it. Why didn't you tell them I had a deadline? Hello, can you see me? I'm here. You know you're kind of a jerk right? Great, great, just fantastic. I have food. Oh yes! That's a good idea. Does anyone else have food? Let's put it all together. Take what you like. Okay, there should be enough for everybody. Nobody has to starve. Rumbly in my tumbly. Cannibalism is off the table. What, you want some? It's for the pain. You know, we got a lot more in common than you like to think kid. Why because you think he pops pills? He's not that much of a loser. You know, they drug test us on the soccer team. Oh and you know everything about your friend, huh? Food, it's food, it's cool. Give me that. What do you got? Oh yes! It's just the corner. Open it now, open it now! I have some water bottles and granola bars. Only granola bars, that's fine though. I have gum. Oh good, that's helpful. Scarlett, do you have anything to eat? No Chase, she gets one of those free welfare lunches that we pay for through our hard earned taxes. Hey... I'm fine! Hey, pork wagon! What? Share. Dude, you do not know how long we are going to be in here. Stand-up guy. Wow. Scary? Wait, is that Fuji? I'll give you $100 for that. Really? $100? That's a little excessive. Don't even think about it. Come on, it's $100. Give her the granola bar instead. Dude, you're hardcore. You make me look sensitive. Psst, $100. Got anymore water? Take it easy, because the more you take in, the more pain you'll be in with no bathroom. What? Save your smart comments until after we've eaten. How would that be helpful? Where'd you get that? Oh this little thing? The kid understands business. And you don't. I like granola bars. Burn man, she gave away your gift. Oh, it's okay. Don't be sad. Hello? Hi, Monica! I know, I've run into a bit of trouble. I know, I know, the blackout. Yeah, at least we have a generator. You're just gonna drink? You should eat something. No, I'm... I had a really big breakfast. He's lying. He's just sad because Scary broke his heart. Hey... I'd reassure you everything is fine if I could just be there. Hey Scary, this is a gift from Chase. It's to replace the old one. Why can't you just leave her alone? Why can't you just leave her alone? It's a love letter. Do you wanna know what it says. I'll read it because you can't read. Do you love Chase? Circle yes, or circle no. Stop! Stop it right now! Get off of him! It's a confined space! What is with you? Do something! Let him go! Break it up. Would you keep it down? Stop. Hurry up and kill each other. I'm on the phone. Okay let them knock each other out. You call yourself a friend? I hate you! What do you keep me around for? To laugh at your jokes? Beat me down when there's no one left to be your punching bag? I'm in an elevator! Keep your enemies close. Is that why you do it? Ethan, stop them. I can't breath with you around. Him, grab him! I got it, I got it! Let him go. Hello? Hello? Let him go. Those punks just cost me $150,000. If that bothers you, don't become a parent. You sit there. You sit there. Don't move. Oh goodie. Stupid kids. Yeah weird, they make you look smart. Excuse me? I can't believe we have to put up with this. So what, you're cursed with coolness, huh? No one can make a move without you giving the okay, is that it? It's common enough with tweens. Can't let anybody else be happy. Poor little rich boy! Oh you're annoying me now, old man. Oh your parents must be real proud of you, huh? This is what they brought into the world, a self-centered bully! This is what they leave behind of themselves? Well it hurts, doesn't it? Everything they give out, I'm gonna give it back harder. Don't give me the cats and the cradle crap. Oh I'm sorry, was that an old person's reference? Alright, you're doing this to get back at your old man. Fine, I get that. You're gonna go skydiving without a parachute, and set yourself on fire. But don't come complaining to me when you turn out to be just like him, or worse, him! He's just gonna turn into me, and at the end, you're gonna blame your old man for everything. You're gonna cry, wah, wah, wah, all the way home. And suck him of all his money and hospital bills and psychiatric fees, while you write him letters about how much he let you down. But when he's dead and gone, you won't have anyone to blame but yourself. Are we through yet? As far as you're concerned, yeah. I'm through with you. I'll take that. Boys are dumb, remember that. That was interesting. Look, I'm only gonna use this for a second. Alrighty, little boy? Only for a second. Yes! You've got internet. 3G huh? I love you. I'm gonna type this up and send it to Deborah, and it'll be like none of this ever happened. One bad, bad dream. You're moving, aren't you? Yes. Well whose gonna keep me awake all night with their dancing? I mean, are you sure about this? Don't worry, someone else will move in. Yeah but, I was used to you. You'll be happy, they probably won't be dancers. I like dancers. I mean, were you ever gonna tell me? So what was it? The cockroaches? Crazy stalkers? Elevator keeps getting stuck? I'm giving up on the dream. I'm leaving New York. I'm sorry, I actually don't wanna talk about it. Are you sure you wanna do that? That's the girl's side. Scarlett I'm sorry. You're sorry? Look, Tristan's a jerk. Why do you hang out with him? Because I'm a jerk too, and we have a lot of fun but, you're right, yeah, you're right. We take it too far. You're in my cooking class, right? You never talk to me. Yeah. Oh my gosh. I like your ring. It's really big. And your shoes too. You know, you look like one of those skater chicks. Do you long board? No. Oh, me neither. I mean, I'm not that great. Oh man... He sucks. He sucks at talking to girls. That's why he didn't talk to you. What? Round two... Look, one time he waited an entire year to talk to a girl, in Kindergarten, and when he finally did, he spilled red paint all over her. It was a disaster. What? He didn't talk to you in cooking class because he... Well, you're scary. Wow, thanks Tristan, you can stop now. Chase talks to a lot of girl in cooking class. Yeah exactly, Scary. That's how Scary you are. Unbelievable. Okay look, sorry. Are you serious? Excuse me? Look, I'm sorry I make fun of you so much, but you just make it so easy and fun! And it wasn't a love letter. See look, it's us in an elevator. A little family photo. Isn't it sweet? You drew a picture of everyone in here? You're terrible. Yeah but it's not bad for stick figures, right? You're really messed up. And look, you're not the only one with a nickname. So you can't take it personally. You didn't! What do you have on me, kid? What, you can't make fun of me because I'm old? Are you kidding? You'll beat me up. "Grumpy Old Man." He got you alright. Good. Well this is a fun game. Let's come up with a nickname for you Tristy. How about the Baby? Our own little embryo. Yeah, I'm reserving something real special for you. I vote man-child. He hasn't grown up yet, but he's wearing a cute little suit for playtime. Done. Yeah. What about Miss Playboy Bunny over here, Overdoes Her Makeup? What? How about you put her down as... It's too late. She's already down as My Cougar Girlfriend. Ew! That's not much better. And Jumpy Leg and New Ageist. Jumpy Leg? Let's go fight some crime. Why am I so scary Tristan? Well you're scary because... Because you're cute, and you have a good voice. I mean, we've heard you sing. So, I think I'm done. Chase you can take it from here. Thanks Tristan, you're really good at talking to girls. Hey... I mean, man, why don't I have a nickname? The embryo's little shadow. I thought I was the workaholic. What are you working on? My article on stupid men. Really? Yep, and I have plenty to say. Ah yes, you are going to have a great future with cats. I'm not the crazy cat lover around here. Oh why am I not surprised? Oh get out, you two dated? That's tough luck man. Yeah, isn't that great? Now I'm the inspiration for all the man hating articles she writes for a lame magazine. I'm what pays the bills. You don't read my articles. I never thought I'd be so famous. I don't write about you! Just because you do the same stupid little things every stupid guy does, doesn't make you special. So every guy loves the Red Sox even though he lives in New York and watches Smallville reruns in his boxers? Yeah! So, where are you moving? Back to Wisconsin. To a much smaller town. A place where I can talk to people and I won't get killed. Seriously, mass murders have ruined small talk in the streets. Wouldn't it be nice to just meet someone up at a corner and strike up a conversation? Yeah but they're called hookers, so... Seriously the population here is in the millions and I can't even talk to just one person. What do you think we're doing? Yeah, we're stuck in an elevator. How often does that happen? I'm on the subway and I see this guy and he smiles at me, and he gets off on the next stop and I get off on another, and I think, was that the one? Was that the one I was supposed to meet? And I couldn't even meet eyes with him because I was afraid he was a psychopath. Well if love were as easy as finding it on the subway we'd find it everyday. And lose it every day. Then you think to yourself, what if I just said hi? What if I just broke the bounds of society and went over and talked to her? How do you talk to someone you don't know? Pretend to know them. Aren't you my sister's mother's cousin's husband's roommate? Yeah, it's pretty bad. You never did that with me. Not pretty enough for you? Too... Pretty. Tristan you're such an idiot, you're the worst teacher ever. Yeah you're right, if I heard that from a complete stranger I'd think he was crazy. No wonder coach won't let you goalie. That's all you can do. Spineless! You're all spineless! I met my wife in Central Park. She was the daughter of a political big wig. I was a nobody. We were from different worlds. The odds of us even having a conversation were nil, but you know what I did? I asked her where she bought her scarf. Like I care about a scarf? The worse she could've done was slap me. So Cougar, that's quite a long second there. Are you ever going to give me back my laptop? Yeah here, you can play with my purse. Don't get into too much trouble. Seriously, how old do you think I am? I don't really care. That's my cougar. Go for it kid. Not even you could handle her. Hey over here. I always wanted to know what was in this. Don't get too excited. There's nothing incriminating. My murder weapons are in my other bag. What's this? Give it here! It's poetry. Sitting in my tree house breathing in the putrid air in the city of sand paper. You can stop reading that now! I didn't know you wrote poetry. There's a lot you don't know about me. So how long did you guys date before you broke up? Too long, and the breakup was even worse. Learn from me, don't date a girl close to home. So let me get this straight, you don't want a smoking hot girlfriend, that works for a famous magazine, and makes tons of money? You'll understand when you're older. Maybe when I'm senile and stupid. It's one of those ironies of life I guess. You're too young to keep a woman happy, and I'm too old for a woman like that to keep me happy. You're all selfish little brats in diapers. You're not willing to work at anything. You don't know what love is! Well I've never had it. Well I have, it's great. You should try it sometime. You know what? I don't wanna hear about your past girlfriends. We're not going out anymore. And I don't wanna hear about your romantic ideals. What, did you fall asleep to Sleepless in Seattle last night? Or was it Pride and Prejudice? Let me guess, you've just discovered Bollywood romances? Oh man... Such a cheesy romantic. Oh, she broke up with you didn't she? Okay now that we're done insulting each other. A children's story? Where'd you get that? I always keep children's books in my bag. Really? Listen up children and I'm going to tell you a story. There aren't any words. Really? We'll just have to make some up then. Hey! Are you paying for that? Man you have some heavy artillery in here. I don't even know what half of this stuff is. Give me your face Scary. Don't do you dare call me Scary. What am I supposed to call you? Scarlett, maybe. It seems obvious. No, don't. Uh, Scarlett looks pretty without it. Check this. I found your color, Scarlett. Make over. Here. Relax this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me... You're doing it wrong. Give it to me. Your fingers are too fat. No, I got it! Chase, you can't... I got it. I really hope that it happens just like you say. But the dragon started to fly around. Hey! Keep it to light colors. It's in the middle of the day. Boring. So why don't you ever come to my... The games? My dad, he doesn't like me to... He doesn't want me to go alone. Why would you go alone? I'll be there. Yeah, you're playing idiot. My parents usually need a babysitter Friday nights anyway. But they have to let you out sometime. I mean, your dad can't be that protective, right? I don't know, I've seen him. He's huge. I mean, didn't he kill somebody one time? Well, that was in self defense, and besides, bar fights don't count. Why, why don't they count? Yeah but he still did jail time for that, didn't he? Yeah but, now he's too smart to get caught, you know? You jerk! Scarlett, how could you help him? Ew gross, you're grounded from my purse! Do you have this in black? Creepy kid. Why the nice act all of a sudden huh? The puppy was really strong... You want something don't you? I can hear your thoughts almost as loudly as my own breathing. Oh you're still breathing? I thought you were so old you were dead. How's that for nice? Well it's a start. So is this makeup gonna do it for the next few years or... Are we going for surgery? You can never be too careful. I mean, 10 years you could be looking like Grumpy Old Man over there. 20. 15. What? 50! I may be old but I'm not deaf. Anybody else brings up how old I am, I'm gonna fake a heart attack right here. Sorry. You look better without it. You've never seen me without it. When we first met at the U2 concert in the park. We got caught in the rainstorm. You ran through this fountain. All this water rushing down your face. You didn't care what you looked like. No one could see me. I did. Gold and, make up... Make up? Make up? You're crazy. So then the dragon went to his cave and took with him his favorite... I thought you said he was a dinosaur. Yes... So why is he blowing smoke? Because it is the ice age and a volcano got him. So, the dragon invited the dainty little dinosaur into his cave and... Then she didn't have to move away and they lived happily ever after. The end. Where'd you get that? Just made it up. No, I meant the book. Oh it's um... It is a present. See? Is it me or are children's books getting weirder? No, it's just that one. I mean, I illustrated it, but it's kind of just a small thing. No you didn't! I'm so sorry. No it pays the bills. I actually prefer drawing people, caricatures. I think it tells a better story. Oh no. I had one of those one time. This guy in the park, he stretched out my neck like a giraffe. He took my worst feature and he attacked it. Who says that's your worst feature? There's something worse than my neck? There is nothing I can say to make that sound good! But that's what I love about art. It... Finds the details that nobody else notices. Here, I saw them on the subway. Who are they? I don't know them. Sometimes it's better that way, you know? Nobody can disappoint you. Something about them... The happiness in their eyes, the way they talked. You know, it's what I love best about art is capturing a moment in time that you can't bring with you. Life is full of goodbyes but here on the page, nothing leaves. Affection in the eyes dulls to boredom, but here is a memory from when we were happy. People live their own lives, they grow up, they go their own ways, but here they can always be a part of you. So do you draw out of happiness or loneliness? Both, there's no other way to create. So this is how you let people go? Capture a moment to say goodbye? It's never gonna be real. It's as real as it's gonna get. ♪ As real as it's gonna get You're hired. I want you to sing at my funeral. Don't. Don't talk about dying. This isn't working. This is exactly like my June article, How to Spot a Player. Oh June, good month. That's when we broke up, wasn't it? Maybe I should take you on a date and you can clear your writer's block. Maybe! Why don't you just write about your adventures in the elevator? Oh because everyone wants to read about that? It would be better than what you dig up on me. You can write about how the floor is covered in lint and dead skin, and fingernails, and how we're all stuck in here with our best friends, our worst enemies, and the strangest of strangers and how we all won't get out of here until we learn some kind of lesson. Here... Come on cougar. Everyone's got a story to tell. Trust me, we'll make Breakfast Club in an elevator. Old person reference. You wouldn't understand. I know. Write about the one thing that really scares you. I think the old man hit it right on. Don't worry, you'll never be the man I am. How about it kid? What scares you the most about being stuck in this elevator? Yeah bad idea. Let's not talk about that. Or maybe we can a do a day in the life of story? Anyone famous in here? Any important jobs? No Cam sorry, you don't have one. Good, great. You can write about someone else for once. How about a real love story? Okay. She was the grumpy one. I was the cheerful one. We fought, we loved, we did our own thing. She had her friends. I went to work. But the kids hung on her every word. We had it all you know? And then after she died. Well I, I lost some money. The house, you know? I had to move from the house to the apartment. The kids drifted away. You can't really blame them you know? There's nothing to hold them there. No money, no mother, just... A dark shadow hanging over the place. I can't even hold a decent conversation anymore. You know, the funny thing is I inherited her friends. There are worse things than death. Mmhm. They're just gonna come to my funeral. My kids, if I keep them in the will. It won't be long now. That's your love story? That sucks. You're not dead yet, so stop acting like it. You ever call your kids? I didn't think so. My dad's already planning his funeral. He's got his coffin picked out. A PowerPoint put together with these pictures and a bunch of cheesy songs on it. Says he's gonna make us all cry. Like it's some sort of joke. You are not dead yet. There are people here that need you! No big deal, people die every day. But not your dad. I'm sorry. I don't even talk to him anymore. Before I left this morning I sat outside of his room for like five minutes and didn't even say goodbye, so... I mean, what if he died today? So I guess I'm not too broken up about it. People died on my operating table. Hold on, you're a doctor? What, just because I'm old and grumpy I can't be useful for anything? No. I'm messing with you. Yeah, I'm a doctor. There's nothing wrong with death, okay? It's the ones that are left behind. Telling families that their loved ones didn't make it, that's worse than death. That's why the idiot interns always get the job, but when it's unexpected, well, we all live with regrets you know? We never get the time to make our peace or to apologize. Or just let them know. Most people would give anything to be able to talk to the dead. So take your chance and do it, kid. Your dad wouldn't want you to die with him. What about your wife? Isn't that what you did. I'm old. I would die with her a million times. I'd look in on your family Tristan and make sure they're alright, if you left for college. Thanks Scarlett. But you don't write about death, do you Mags? No you write about how stupid men are. Oh I talk about death. Love is dead. Where are the gentlemen who stick with you and don't get bored? What happened to the men in the fairy tales who protected you? You've watched too many chick flicks. Just have low expectations, right? That way you're never disappointed. Yeah, movies messed this girl up. Remember the go after your dreams movies of the 80s? Never give up, be the best? You can do anything if you try hard enough? I shouldn't have listened. Being the best never made me happy. It just pushed everyone away. The stars have it bad. Marilyn Monroe, very successful, very unhappy. Very hot. Go after your dreams, but what if your dreams hurt you? Sometimes I wish I just got in a car accident and broken my leg and then none of this would have happened. Then you'd be normal. What is normal? Having a family, kids, reading a book on a cool day and going to the beach? Yeah, I want that. Why can't you? You're an artist Ethan. Didn't you make sacrifices to get where you're at? I wish I knew my neighbors better. Grow up! You give up too fast. Life is full of sacrifices to get what you want. That's what my parents told me when we had to move out here. We left our family, and our friends, and our house just so my dad could get a job here. Now we never see him. Mom wants a divorce, and everyone hates me at school, even the girls. Well of course they hate you. You're prettier than all of them. They're jealous. Sorry, that was something I heard my mom say to my sister once. Sorry... You're not looking too good there kid. Is there something you're not telling us? Mags, you're the writer here. Do what you do. Give it all meaning. I can't. Get that deep? I can't write with you sitting there when all I can think about is how mad I am at you! You're mad? Alright Maggie, let's have it out! What will it be? This, your pen? I know, let's talk about why we broke up. Whoa, right now? I mean, nobody wants to hear that. Who's Ariel? Seriously? The one you were talking to on the phone? The girl who's beautiful face you miss? No one. She's... Don't bother talking if you're gonna lie. You wanna know? Okay. No, don't tell me. Tell me! No, don't. I wasn't planning on it. Oh please. You never wanted to be with me, ever. Admit it. Who was Ryan? The guy that you told to throw out all our old pictures? Yeah, I loved our trip to Statin Island by the way. You can't just throw that stuff out. Ryan... Is my answering machine. I wasn't talking to anyone on the phone, happy? Ariel's my niece. Oh... Oh. Well what was it then? Was I too smart, too stupid, too nice? Well I tried to be nice and then you dumped me. I dumped you? You broke up with me! Yes you did, you said you wanted to talk! I did wanna talk. Well we sure did that. We talked alright. I never wanna talk again. You said you can't be happy. You blame me because you don't wanna blame yourself. You know, you hide under all this sarcasm, but take away the heels and the power jacket, and you're just a lost little girl! You're just a bully who wants to shove me in the mud. Why do you care? I'm just a stupid guy. I can't hurt you. I can't possibly mean that much to you! Maggie? Give me that. Get us out of here. We're going to drill a hole through the elevator floor if you don't do something about us. I really need a bathroom. Me too. Well quit drinking so much. I'm thirsty. You hear that? Get to us before you have to mop up an even bigger mess. Why aren't they coming? I don't know. All of New York has a problem. Maybe it's a setup and they're trying to kill us. Well maybe the last guy you talked to had a heart attack and died. Maybe the last guy I talked to was a Nazi. Maybe everybody out there's a zombie. Zombies again. Is that camera busted? You'd think they'd at least see us. Hey kid, if you're gonna make your move you better make it snappy. You're about to lose anything close to a romantic mood. Give me your number. You want people in your life but you're afraid to go and talk to them. Well we're stuck in this big box, so let's do it already. Get to know me. Would you rather get in a bath filled with razor blades, or have a million paper cuts all over your body? Sorry, a little dark. Is there lemon juice involved? No. Paper cuts. Would you rather chew two bags of pink bubble gum in one hour or stuff 13 giant marshmallows in your mouth and have them disintegrate down your throat for the next half an hour? Two packs of bubble gum, if I had some tums. No tums. That is still my final answer. Lame. Would you rather go home to boring old Wisconsin or stay in the big bad city with me? Is there dancing involved? Everywhere you go there's dancing. Or are you afraid we're gonna be them in two years? I give it six months. How, if you're not here? Stay away from my neck. I will try. What's the matter boy? Don't they take you to the gym? Don't they let you out of the office here boy? I am so sorry. Wimp. Back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, it was a man that asked for the commitment, not the woman. Get off it Bill. Just because you're old doesn't mean you can say what you want. Yes it does. Man I'd love to set you loose on my dad Bill. If he had half your guts. Finally figured out he's human, huh? Yeah, kids never forgive their parents for that. See, guts. No... The battery died! It didn't warn! Tristan fix your computer! Let me see. Take a deep breath. This can't be happening. If I don't get this into my editor, I'm fired! Can we text it to your editor's email? Text this whole thing? No! Give it here. We'll text it. There's no possible way you can do that. Actually, we kind of can. It's what we do. Wait, Scarlett do you have a phone? Of course she has a phone. I was being a jerk. Come on cougar, hand it over. Let's see those notes. Ignore the cross outs. Don't save my editor's number in your phone or you're dead. What is this, a foreign language or something? What, is it code? Give it to me. I can read her handwriting. You can? Sitting on the elevator floor gives me a new perspective. First you see a nail, some lint, some dead skin. The nail is chipped, pink nail polish. Maybe it belonged to a chronic nail biter. Maybe she stood nervously next to a guy she couldn't talk to. We pushed the same buttons to reach the same floors. We shared the same space, but I could never pick them up from a line up. Huh, weird. I never knew that they were my neighbors. I don't think I knew what a neighbor meant. I'll get it. Sorry I can't help. If you need it. You too? You gonna text a whole article? I can't even get my TV to work. Don't get soft on me now Bill. You don't wanna disappoint me do you? Can't even wish the kids a good morning without them getting suspicious. My wife though, she's the only thing I did right. The kids hung onto every word. Maybe I shouldn't have been so hard on them. Why, because they don't visit? They're losers. I'd visit you. I was wrong about you. I think... You wanna make a bet? What? As soon as they finish texting that article we're getting out of here. Well it's a zombie day so as soon as we get out of here, we're dead. A goodbye present. My hair's not pulled back and I'm not wearing that shirt. That was the first time that I met the girl behind the shoes. It was the end of a long day. You were going up 22 stories. You had that smile that you have, with the lip curling up. Your ballet shoes were tucked in your bag and I knew that you were the girl dancing above me. Grace, don't dance for them. Do it for yourself. It's the only way you're gonna be happy. You've captured the girl with the shoes. You stole her soul. Now that you have this, you won't need her anymore will you? Go ahead. I'll just wait right here. Hey baby... No, I didn't forget your party. I'm sorry but I love you. Oh um hey, actually... There are a bunch of good people here who would like to wish you a merry Christmas, uh huh. Yeah, hold on. Can you guys sing We Wish You A Merry Christmas to Sarah? I missed her Christmas party. Would you mind? ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year ♪ Good tidings we bring ♪ To you and your kin ♪ We wish you... ♪ We wish you... ♪ A merry Christmas Hey, yeah. So... Planning on running a marathon? Your leg. Yeah, so who's there? Make it easy for him. Let him down gently. Oh he'll run. That's what you're planning on doing, isn't it? Yeah. Giving up again? Love you too. See you soon. Yeah, bye. Who's Sarah? She's my daughter... The drawings are for her. It's kind of her thing, because even if her mom isn't in my life anymore, we still wanna be able to find a way to... I look happy. Well if you can find happiness in an elevator you can find it anywhere, right? I know why I was happy. I was with you. Take it with you when you go to Wisconsin. No, I don't want it. I want people Ethan. I want you, to take it to your daughter. Give it to her. So what's in this box anyways? Sent. That would be two pages of bad handwriting. Scarlett? I got it now. Sweet. We would have been done two minutes ago if Chase wasn't on drugs. Hear that Chase, if you weren't on drugs... Chase! Are you okay? Bill, help him out, Bill! Chase what's going on? Look man, I'm sorry. Bill, what is going on? Do you know anything about this? Are you okay? What is it, drugs? What are you taking Chase? I didn't forget my homework Trist. I forgot an extra pen. I didn't take my Lantus last night, and those donuts... I'm diabetic. What? No, you said pen... He tried to take his novolog. The thing clicked four times, it's empty. Why didn't you say something? I didn't think we'd be stuck here for 10 hours okay? Kid, what's your BG level? 600. He should be in the hospital. He has DKA. If we don't do something, he's gonna slip into a coma. You knew all along? Why didn't you say something? And how would that have helped anything? Look, if he'd wanted you to know, he would've told you. This is really stupid man. If I would've told you, you would've called me Sugar Rush. Bill, what do we do here? He needs insulin. Oh well let me check my pockets! Pick up, pick up, come on... Hello. Hello! - Hello? - Hello? Am I talking to a real person? What, were you having a tea party up there? We were supposed to be out here 10 hours ago. What were you morons thinking? We're not getting out of here until we help each other. We have an emergency. Get my glucometer bag. It's in the inside pocket of my jacket. We need to get him out of here now. Chase, do you need food? Yes, yes, get over here. I have a candy bar. Why do you still have food? I didn't know long we were gonna be stuck in here. I mean we could've started eating each other! And you were gonna use that to bargain for your life? Look man, just take it. Come on. Hey, we are gonna get you out of this, okay? You're gonna be okay. This? Perfect. They said 20 minutes to get us out. They said they didn't see us. The idiot switched shifts and he didn't tell anyone we were down here. Do they even look at the cameras? They've gotta get an ambulance down here. Are you okay Bill? He doesn't have that long... I thought I would be the one they carried out of here on a stretcher. Never leave home without it. Kid, what's your insulin sensitivity, 50? Well, that might not be enough. Wait, you're taking all of it? Bill, are you sure about this? You don't look so good. Can you last 20 minutes? You're giving him the rest of your insulin? How long did you know about Chase? You didn't turn off your pump for him, did you? Well, I knew one of us would need it. You did that for us? No, no you don't do that! Never would have thought it of me, would ya? Because it's reckless, and selfless, and stupid. I knew as soon as I put it together. What are the odds? Both of us trapped in here. Same medication? Nah, it's too much of a coincidence. God has given me a chance to leave this life without being a complete jerk. But you don't need it, right? You don't need it! Hey! Ow, don't... Alright you're gonna feel like you've been hit by a cement truck for the next few hours kid. I think he'll be okay. You're not leaving us yet. So this is it? You just give your life for him? Why would you do that? Why would you help some stupid kids like us? We mean nothing to you, we're just strangers. None of you are strangers. You're a liar! You're supposed to be some grumpy old man. What a fake! So is that my new nickname kid, huh? Grumpy, fake? Well, why don't you come speak at my funeral, and you and my kids can trade I hate Bill stories! Hey, if you can get them to come, I'll even put you in the will. You just love this, don't you? You get everything you want. You die like a hero and you leave the rest of us here! I knew I hated you. Relax kid. I'm not dead yet. Stop making light of this. I'm not your dad! People die. You've gotta decide how you treat the living. No regrets. Don't do it like I did. Stay with us Bill. I see you, mean little girl. What was it that made you feel powerless? So afraid, you're gonna fade into nothing, and then what? Bill don't... You can't show anybody the real you except what's on the outside. You can't let anyone in. So why'd you take a chance on this guy? You knew better. You're smarter than that. I know, love hurts. I can't stop loving her either. There's no fear in love. I can't believe you. Giving your last words like you think it means something. Bill listen to me! You wake up in the morning and think you're all alone in a building full of strangers who are all just like you, coldness, and pride, anger, loneliness, disease, fear, and ambition. Friends and enemies, all a part of you. You think you're in here for us? To help us? This isn't some stupid Christmas TV miracle story. Tristan, he's dying... I don't care! That doesn't give him the right. You hear me Bill, you are so full of it. Just because you don't wanna live doesn't mean you can ask us to do it for you! I won't, none of us will. Baby girl. You sing your songs. Don't wait for the world to give you permission, because nobody will. Shut up! And you. So what? You gonna let me have it now? You're the worst of all of us. You remind me of me. Figures. I figure a smart kid like you would do something about that. What does God get out of this? We have to watch you die now? I sit and watch my dad dying and I'm not gonna do it again! You fight through this. You stupid coward! I knew I liked you. What if we were here to help you? What about that? ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender and so mild ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep ♪ Sleep in ♪ Sleep in ♪ Oh Sleep in heavenly ♪ Peace oh my gosh, Bill? Chase, wake up. Chase? Chase, come on. Oh man... Hey, you coming to my game? I don't think you are going to your game. I'm not watching anybody else. I'll give this back when you come and visit me. Her dad's gonna murder you. Just saying, Sugar Rush. I really hate you. I'm sorry sir, nobody is allowed through here. You're kidding me. We have tickets to the theater and we need to go right now. Sir, I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do. Won't you come this way please? This is unacceptable. I'm really sorry ma'am. This is just a minor inconvenience. Everything will be cleared up in just a bit. But how long? We need to go. We have theater tickets. You won't miss your show. We need to get out of here. Paul, please go get Jones. I should catch the last bus out. You wanna share a taxi or... I've got it. Yeah, me too. I mean, I've already missed my daughter's party. I should probably just go back to my apartment. If you miss your bus... It was really nice to meet you. Yeah. I need to answer this. Hey, yeah, yeah I know. He was old. Sometimes these things happen. Bad news? My editor, she got the article. She hates it. It was in poor taste to text and she doesn't know what she's gonna do with it anyway. She thinks it's sentimental trash. So she wants more of the same old crap then, huh? You know, I could help you out with that. How? I could pick you up around 8:00? You've always been the romantic. Never have Maggie, but if you want me to, I'll try. Cameron, if you said that four months ago you could've said anything and I would've come back to you, but I'm strong now. So, what would you do if I kissed you? I'd pretend to be mad. Maybe write an article about it. That's my girl. Come here. Hey kid, got off the lawn or I'll shoot you. What? A message from the old man. I know the guy. Come on, I'll give you a ride to the hospital. He cleared you for it. Grumpy old man. If he tries to die on me, so help me there's something I need to say at his funeral. Right to his kids. Come on O'Hara, Bill's a fighter. We've got more fighting to do. Oh hey, Jumpy Leg, there's some New Ageist waiting in the back there for you. Don't you guys gotta go fight some crime together? You know, I'm totally cool with being friends. Really? No. Oh it's gonna be a lot harder to get me back than that. Good, that'll be fun. Ma'am? But you are going to love your present. Mmhm, yeah, I'll bring it by tomorrow. Okay, love you bye. Hey buddy, this one's broken. It's not gonna take you anywhere. You look familiar. Have I seen you before? Maybe at the supermarket. Do you shop at Macy's? No, I think it was somewhere else. Don't you live on floor 22? Yeah but it might take us a while to get there in this elevator. Hey people, this one's broken! You're gonna have to use the one at the other end of the building. Look Ethan, I'm not gonna be your muse. I get mad sometimes and I laugh really loud, but... You don't have to remember me, or the way I stand or smile because I'm not going anywhere. Here that box looks heavy. Let me grab that for you. Oh, sorry! Sorry.
