Calm down! Calm down! Goemon! Don't let him get away! Don't let Goemon get away! There's Goemon, I see him. There he is. There he is. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up and walk. Hurry! That guy Goemon, I heard he stood right up... in the boiling oil and cursed an official, saying... "I'm not going to forget your faces." I heard the official suffered, was wracked with fever for three days, and finally went insane. Hanzo, over here. You're slipping, Hanzo. It's not that dark in here, yet you still can't see me... and you call yourself a ninja? Your abilities have diminished since you started serving leyasu. Yeah, sure. Here's some sake and food. Hey. What were you praying to Buddha about? I wouldn't pray. I was expressing resentment. Resentment? Though I prayed that I might kill Hideyoshi... notwithstanding the karmic hellfire that I was willing to incur... my wishes were trampled in the dust. Such words only court divine punishment. It is only because the gods approve of your ambitions... that I was brought here to lend you a helping hand. Your skills have declined, but your mouth has become more adept. Be that as it may, you've greatly impressed me, Ishikawa Goemon. Your severed head has been on display for 10 days... but people are still flocking to see it. I hear folks are coming all the way from Otsu and Nara just to see it. I don't want to hear about it. I feel pity for the man who died in my place. Who cares? The guy was a condemned man anyway. And his wife was happy to receive an unexpected windfall. Hanzo... why did you help me? Because I want your dream to become reality. Is that all? I didn't want your ninja skills to go to waste. Is that what leyasu said? No, you got it wrong. This has nothing at all to do with His Highness. Iga has been under attack. Saiga has been crushed. The way things are going, the ninja will soon be extinct. That's what vexes me. I need you alive, no matter what. I'll do whatever it takes. I'll bring you food... I'll get you money... why are you laughing? What's so funny? When it came to reading people, I was second to none at the Momochi Garrison. I can see through your fa√ßade with a single glance. Though I'm a ninja, who was born into darkness and will die in darkness... I'm getting weary of spending my days here staring at statues. All you have to do is endure just a little longer, until the excitement wears off. "Excitement?" Ishikawa Goemon's severed head's on display, isn't it? Listen Hanzo. I'm taking orders from no one, but I'm going to kill Hideyoshi anyway. It's not going to be easy. Hideyoshi isn't what he used to be, either. He became the Kampaku, which even Nobunaga couldn't achieve. Then he made his adopted son Hidetsugu take his position, and now he's the Taiko. He won't be easy to get at, will he? I was taught that the greatest shame for a ninja is to admit something is impossible. But I'm in no hurry. Slaying him right away won't satisfy me. I'm going to slowly torment him... then torment him even more, and when I'm done, I'll kill him. With my own hands. Hey... Hey... what? Goemon's head got stolen? Yes sir, I am so sorry. Fool! Our official reputation's at stake! Find it no matter what! Find it no matter what! Yes sir. What's going on? What's going on? This way. That way. Congregations are gathering, and the monks are having to rush to their headquarters. I hear it's pandemonium at the temples. But what a refreshing story it is. The thieves donated all the money stolen from the police commissioner... as an offering on behalf of the unknown dead. Now that's a feel-good story you hardly hear nowadays. We're the only ones gloating though, the officials are in a panic... they've been running around since dawn. You think they'll catch them? You think they'll catch them? I wonder. I wonder. What do you think? I wonder. What do you think? What do you think? This stunt was truly superhuman! Maybe a tengu did it, having descended to this world to reform it. That's right, this is a tengu's doing. It must be a tengu from Iga or Koga. Iga or Koga? Yeah. Ishikawa Goemon's head vanished. That's the main proof. Come on in. Yes sir. Welcome, and thank you very much. I'm terribly sorry, but we're full right now. What? What? Hold it. Innkeeper, we didn't come to drink. We've run up quite a tab with you, but we two ronin have been hired by the Todo Clan. We're here to pay you what we owe. My congratulations. Yes... Here. Thank you. Thank you. Keep the change. Keep the change. Thank you very much. Keep the change. Thank you. Any riffraff with two swords can find employment these days. It's a relief to be rid of those ronin, but I hope it doesn't mean another war. Inuhachi of Nabori. You lose. Two more sun and you would've been dead. Goemon? You couldn't sniff Goemon out, Inuhachi? So much for your sense of smell! Right after he crushed Saiga, Hideyoshi set fire to Negoro'ji Temple. We ran for our lives to Mount Koya... and while we were stuck there because of the massive ninja-hunt... messengers arrived from the Sanada Clan of Shinshu. "Kite-Bird"Hachi'emon and "Red-Eyed"Senkichi... turned mercenary and left the mountain with them. But I just couldn't sell myself out. So you became a highwayman instead? And look at who I choose to be my victim: Ishikawa Goemon. It's just as you say, this Inuhachi's lost his sense of smell. Anyway, I wouldn't have thought in my wildest dreams that you were alive. Hey, Goemon. I too hate Hideyoshi. I want to kill him. I beg you, let me join you. I refuse. I refuse. Why? I don't want anyone's help killing Hideyoshi. I'm going to kill him with my own two hands. Torment him slowly... torment him even more... and when he's done... Fine then. Patient waiting happens to be one of my articles of faith. Be that as it may, he's wreaking havoc in the capital every night. The officials are cracking down with more severity... If this keeps up, even Goemon will... be caught, is that what you are trying to say? Yes. Though we send him all the money he needs, he continues to steal. He's quite smug about it, saying that it is the best way to stir things up. Let him do what he wants. He thinks he is following his own path... but actually he is walking the road I have made for him. But don't let him out of your sight. Now go. Yes sir. Hanzo? First he causes civil unrest at the capital... which will prompt Hideyoshi into action. That must be his plan. This Ishikawa Goemon... had he been a samurai, he would've become the lord of a fief. Do you really think so? It's extremely difficult to engage Hideyoshi in direct conflict, to arrange such a victory. I have first-hand experience in this, and know it down to my bones. Just a few years ago... during the time of Akechi Mitsuhide's revolt... I was Lord Nobunaga's guest of honor, and was received with hospitality. Hideyoshi was merely a military commander then. But after his defeat of Mitsuhide, he moved with the speed of lightning... and single-handedly laid the foundation of his national supremacy. Even my counterattack at Komaki Nagakute, calculated to reverse his situation... ended in defeat, due to Nobukatsu's unexpected betrayal. It's been five years since then. Now Hideyoshi is the Taiko, and I am a mere Daimyo, subject to his whims. Alas, the difference in our ranks is now considerable. Even so, His Lordship the Taiko is paying partic- ular attention to you, Your Highness. "Ochacha:"Hideyoshi's concubine. And thus we find ourselves in Yodo Castle, the home of"Ochacha"... as his guest, Your Highness. Since the birth of Hideyori... his concubine has become the focus of all the affection of the Lord Taiko. From this circumstance, I can infer that... he holds you in great esteem, Your Highness. It's all quite transparent. Be that as it may... Hideyori's birth has introduced two new complications. One is... Hidetsugu's anxiety about the security of his status as Kampaku. The other is the matter of Ochacha... who has gained more influence than his faithful wife of many years... having risen in status, so much so that... people now refer to her as "Lady Yodo." How will he unravel these two knots? Perhaps for Hideyoshi, these issues... are more burdensome than concerns of war. His Highness approaches. What? His Lordship? Even now, he is on his way from the gate to Lord Tokugawa's apartments. Listen, Lord leyasu. I have a good reason for not waiting until tomorrow to visit with you. Oh, what could that be? I want you to do me a favor. If it is within my power. I am fortunate that my status in the nation is high... so much so that I control the course of events. Nevertheless, I am of lowly birth... and though my vassals bow their heads, many of them are inwardly resentful. Therefore tomorrow, when the Daimyo gather in assembly... I need you to be well disposed towards me. Well disposed? I will behave in an arrogant manner toward you. To which I want you to respond courteously, with great politeness. Then the Daimyo will say:"Even Lord Tokugawa treats him with respect..." and they'll reconsider how they should regard me. What do you say? Will you do this for me? Very well, I shall. Until tomorrow, then. How many children do you have? I have 13 of them. Hmm, that makes me envious. I had my first at fifty-eight. It's wonderful though, isn't it? Your Highness... You must retire soon, lest you be tired tomorrow. Tell me, Hitachinosuke. Why were the Daimyo summoned to this assembly? Well... I believe that it is to introduce them to young Lord Hideyori. Could that be all? Or maybe he will demote me, in favor of Hideyori. Never! Lord Hideyori is the son of a concubine, but you, Your Highness... although actually His Highness' nephew, are the rightful, adopted heir. Please do not be overly anxious, and get some rest. Your words of comfort are futile. You yourself know full well that he has good reason to be anxious. Who are you? The moment Hideyori was born... Hidetsugu's prospects took a great turn. Hideyori is the source of great joy for Hideyoshi. He never let himself believe that he would have a natural son. But now that he has, he regrets having made Hidetsugu the Kampaku. There are those who are fanning the flames... namely, Lady Yodo and Ishida Mitsunari. Hidetsugu's fate is as good as sealed. Who are you?! You have ceremoniously gathered here... today, at the appointed time... to be introduced to Hideyori. This is Hideyori, heir to the Toyotomi Clan! Right, Hideyori? Go now, your mommy will hold you. "O'ne'ne:" Nickname of Lady Kita'no'man'dokoro, Hideyoshi's legal wife. O'ne'ne and Hideyori are my priceless treasures. There are those among you who have been my colleagues... and even my seniors at one time. However, from this moment on... I absolutely forbid you to so much as point your finger at them! Lord Tokugawa, I expect you to remember that, and obey. How sad that you should say that. I, leyasu, am intimately familiar with you, my Lord Taiko. And just as I pay you homage as a lifelong vassal... so also to Her Ladyship and young Lord Hideyori... I firmly pledge my constant loyalty. Lord Tokugawa, I express my sincere gratitude on behalf of Hideyori. I wish to grant you a gift. Is there anything that you desire? Well then, in response to your gracious offer... I would like to have the haori that you are currently wearing. I cannot allow it. It has my essential coat of arms for times of battle. What are you saying? As long as I live, I am determined to ensure you never need wear that battle-coat again. Did you hear that? Lord Tokugawa says that he will never let me go out in battle again. I am honored. Though I have given Lord Tokugawa my battle-coat... battles are yet to be fought! Our nation of Japan has been unified, our national prestige is on the rise. "Ming:" China, at that time ruled by the Ming Dynasty Emperors. Let us ride the tide and conquer the nations of Ming and Korea! We must expand our territorial rule overseas... such was the will of the late Minister of the Right... Lord Oda, and is my life's ambition as well. Ming is a vast territory, the soil is fertile and the resources abundant. I have made overtures with Korea about opening up trade with Ming... but we have yet to receive a definite response from them. The time has come to crush Korea with a single blow. And after that, we will not stop, but rather invade Ming. May I humbly implore you to not deploy overseas. Why is that? To deploy a large army, we need weapons, ammunition, and supplies. This would require a great fleet of large ships. That goes without saying. Starting today, we shall stop building new castles... and needless to say, will suspend all renovations. We shall stop construction of the Daibutsu'den. Instead, we shall channel all our resources and manpower into ship construction. It's not only about ships. If we were to attack Ming... the battlefront will be spread over several hundred ri... which will make supplying the troops extremely difficult. This must be obvious to all. Are all of you in agreement with Kiyomasa? I, Mitsunari, view matters differently. If I may be so bold, it is by virtue of over- coming unprecedented difficulties... that we will be able to do that which has never been done before. Well said. I myself shall take command. All of you will make the necessary preparations to deploy your troops at a moment's notice. If I may be so bold. Who will manage our internal affairs if you, my Lord, take command? What else do we have a Kampaku for? Even Hidetsugu could do it. A royal procession is on the way! It's Lord Hideyori's procession! Gohei! Gohei! Help! Gohei! Gohei! Bastards! Gohei! Gohei! Though he too was born a human being... they tossed him, my son Gohei, into the fire, burning him to death. And now, Hideyoshi's son Hideyori is surrounded by a samurai retinue... and the people are forced to prostrate themselves before him. Goemon, believe the Buddha. Remember how you devotedly recited the Nenbutsu when you were at Saiga. My wife... was brutally murdered under the flag of Nenbutsu. And you still insist that the Buddha exists? If it takes me seven reincarnations, I will tear Hideyoshi to shreds. And not just him. I will exterminate the entire Toyotomi Clan. Things are starting to happen. So they're deploying to Korea after all? Indeed. Hideyoshi himself is taking command. It seems he hasn't noticed my letter of challenge. Letter of challenge? I wreaked havoc in the capital... as a letter of challenge to Hideyoshi, to show him that Goemon still lives. He hasn't taken any notice. Not only that, he's about to leave. What will you do? Take me to my mansion, I will give you all the money you want. It's not a lie, it's not a lie! We don't want money. Spare me, have mercy, have feelings, please, spare me! We don't want to take your life either. What then do you want? We're done, beat it! I am grateful. Keep your mouth shut. You'll just be made a laughingstock. Courtier Nagon of Seson'ji has sent a messenger to you, Your Ladyship... and has brought congratulatory gifts from the Imperial Palace. Another gift from the Palace? The Emperor has already bestowed upon us a royal sword. This succession of gifts... honors Hideyori more than I can express in words. Not at all. I am charged to instruct you... that he be carefully raised, so as to preclude any chance of illness. Yes sir. This is the item we received just the other day. Please take a look. Ah... well well... Nice design... nice colors... It suits him well. Let's see. Oh, what a cute face. Indeed, he is the very image of his father. He looks just like a monkey. I'll take him with me and teach him to do tricks. Who are you? You tell Hideyoshi what it feels like... the agony of having one's family taken from you. Inuhachi! Hideyori! Hideyori! Hideyori! Scream louder. Go ahead and cry! What's going on, Inuhachi? Inuhachi, look out! This way. They went this way. Hey! Hey! These leaves were specially chosen and roasted. What a fine item, I have heard your province is famous for its tea. As always, Lord Tokugawa, your thoughtfulness gladdens me. Your words alone have made my visit worthwhile. In recent days, the Daimyo visit the other wing. Those who come here have become few in number. No matter what, I, leyasu, will always recognize you... Lady Kita, as the official wife of our Lord Taiko. I'll be so bold as to say, that His Lordship is what he is today... due to your unending sacrifices on his behalf... ever since the days of Kinoshita Tokichiro. I firmly believe this. If even one person acknowledges that, it is reward enough. If I may say, as I watched you smile as you embraced young Lord Hideyori today... I, leyasu, felt sympathy in my heart. I have never felt more misery as a childless woman as I did today. What? Ishikawa Goemon? Don't be absurd. No sir, according to one of my ninja informants... his skills were matchless. He inferred that it could be no other than Goemon himself. Are you indeed certain that it was Ishikawa Goemon? Yes. The use of floor-mats to absorb bullets... is an advanced Iga-style technique that is passed down only orally. Who then was executed on the bank of the Sanjo River? Sir... we are currently interrogating the execution officials. But if Goemon is still alive... the recent rash of burglaries could also be his doing. Increase the castle's security, even more than you think reasonable. Use a fine-tooth comb and search him out. Catch Goemon! Yes sir. According to rumor, no matter how tight a castle's security might be... nothing can keep Goemon out. Don't worry, don't worry. Yukimura is a reliable man. But... Never mind that Goemon. Let's talk about our Hideyori here. Ne'ne said that she wants to help you raise him to be an upstanding man. I wonder if she is sincere? I wonder if she is sincere? Well of course she is. Just look at this boy. Anyone would feel the same way. Right, Hideyori? I will let you hold in your tiny little hands not only this land, but... the nations of Ming and Korea as well. Your Highness... Your Highness. What shall we do about the request for troops? We must reply to the Lord Taiko. You're bothering me. Indeed, I want to participate. But if I were to leave Edo, who will defend the area to the east of Hakone? I believe that it would be more loyal to His Lordship for me to decline his request. Is that not so, right, Tadakatsu? Understood. I shall reply that way immediately. He's crossing the ocean with an army of 160,000 men. Truly a scheme worthy of our Lord Taiko. It's the minor Daimyo that'll get a raw deal. Farmers and merchants will be made to suffer unspeakable agonies. There will be inflation, and farming villages will be brought to ruin. Each of these threads will weave themselves together... and become a giant rope that will strangle Hideyoshi. This is no time to be drinking. Note: "Nagoya" refers to Hizen Nagoya Castle, a castle built in Kyushu to serve as the launching point forthe Korean invasion. Hideyoshi's on his way to his headquarters in Nagoya. No need to panic. So you know. What's your plan? I'll stop the burgling. Then what? I'll exterminate Hideyoshi's house- hold, but not before I make them suffer. Suffer? Don't be stupid. Ever since they landed in Korea... they've been victorious on all fronts, and have taken control. They're probably whooping it up in Nagoya. I can just picture Kiyomasa's face when he learned Yukinaga landed first. Indeed. According to a dispatch from Lord Yukinaga... Lord Kiyomasa has been protesting ever since he landed... and has been going out of his way to express his opinion. That must be so. Lord Yukinaga is a resourceful commander, well suited to a foreign adventure... as he has the flexibility to adapt his tactics. But Lord Kiyomasa is unflinchingly rigid... a leader who sticks to old strategies from 10 years ago, without change. I am puzzled as to why you have assigned those two to command the vanguard. You fool. Pitting those two polar opposites against each other... has facilitated our swift advancement. Now Kiyomasa will become increasingly frustrated... and predictably, will charge ahead to beat his competition. Lady Yodo must be pleased with the news. Don't mention Yodo. When I think of Hideyori, I just wish I could fly back to be with him. Speaking of which... I hope Hidetsugu is handling things properly in my absence. Regarding that matter, I have very bad news. What happened? Well... he has been hosting parties on a daily basis. Lowly entertainers have been frequenting the castle day and night... and it is said that the laughter of courtesans can be heard well into the wee hours. I was wrong about him. He wasn't fit to be Kampaku after all. After we have conquered Korea, I will appoint Hidetsugu as my viceroy. Ruling Korea would be somethiing even Hidetsugu could handle. "Monkey swine! You are losing your battles in Korea. "Your trusted commanders have turned on you. "Learn of the misery of the people, the farmers. "Soon the time approaches when you too will know the agony of karmic fire." My apologies for interrupting your pleasures. What do you want? What do you want? Yes sir. I received orders from Nagoya to provide the second group of 2,000 troops. Though I am to deploy them immediately... ours is a small fief, and I am ashamed to say that we are low on war funds. We have increased the levies, but to no avail. However, I have heard that you granted a loan to Lord Asano Yukinaga. Thus I too would trust in your benevolence... and humbly implore you to help me! Military funding is top priority. I must not hinder the war and let my father down. Hitachinosuke, give him what he requires. Thank you very much. I'm sure you're quite relieved. Indeed. Not only for me, but for the entire fief, as we faced a true crisis. How much will you be needing? If I may, could we receive 2,000 ryo? Very well. I am much obliged. But let me remind you, you must understand... that the money is from war funds entrusted to His Highness by... his father, the Taiko. His Highness is doing this to extricate you, Lord Hosokawa, from your dire situation. No need to mention it. I am indebted to him for life. I shall remain steadfastly loyal. The Taiko, using the pretense of ruling Korea... has decided to send Hidetsugu away. Be careful, because you're going to be next. Goemon. This is an order from His Highness, the Taiko. Die! It's them,"Red-Eyed"Senkichi and"Kite-Bird"Hachi'emon. Thanks to you, I feel cheerful, a feeling that I have long missed. Lady Kita, there is no greater joy to me, Hidetsugu... than to know that I have given you some relief. You will hear all kinds of rumors. But no matter what they say, you are the Kampaku. Be of strong will, and do not let yourself be defeated. Huh? If our Lord Taiko asks you to govern Korea... what would you say to him? If he asks me to govern Korea? If you speak thus... you will invite the anger of the gods. If you fear the mountain gods, then love cannot begin. As the song says, love is a funny thing. You, following your heart, consumed by love, how pitiful you are to watch. When you are in love... when you are in love... well, well, well, well... you forget about your age. Well, well, well, why do you fall in love? Who will blossom again? Blossom again? Love is, love is, love is, love is... isn't it for the young? Flowers blossom on a withered tree... Flowers blossom on a withered tree... Stop! Good job. You may now leave. Hold it there, old man. I want to pour you a drink. I'm talking to you! Yes sir. Draw near. Draw near. Yes sir. Here. Insolence! Your Highness! You must contain yourself, or there will be more rumors. I don't care! The Lord Taiko is stripping me of power, under the pretext of my governing Korea. And he's going to give all to Hideyori! Your Highness! You must watch what you say in front of strangers! Silence! I'm getting exiled from Japan anyway! Your safe return gladdens me. Thank you for the good work during my absence. I also appreciate your having cared for Hideyori too. Congratulations on your safe return. Here comes the horse-ee... here he comes, here he comes... here he comes, here he comes... here comes the horse-ee... My... I'm thirsty. I'm so thirsty. He seemed to like it, look how happy he looks. I am the one who is the happiest. I never imagined you would be back so soon. What are you talking about? My main reason for returning here was to see Hideyori... and secondly, it was to see the face of my "Ochacha." So, I am secondary, am I? Forgive me. I am a man who cannot tell a lie. Your Ladyship. What is it? The Kampaku says that he must see His Lordship. He came all the way here? Let him in. Yes sir. You're far more audacious than I thought. How can you look me straight in the face? Father! Father! Refer to me as the Lord Taiko! Before I left Hizen Nagoya Castle, I sent you several warnings. How do you explain your various instances of misconduct? You neglected your duties, indulged in women and drink... squandered public funds entrusted to you... and murdered an innocent citizen for no reason. Your sins are many. I shall investigate them on another day. That is all I have to say to you. So, you will charge me with misconduct... and give the nation to Hideyori instead? Silence! Get out! Get lost! Hidetsugu, your end has come at last. You have only one way out, and that is to die. Or you will be killed. By your own parent, no less. Even in this last war, he influenced our Lord Taiko... so that we always had to face the stronger enemy, and suffered more casualties. Mitsunari's ulterior motives are obvious. Furthermore, he exploited the Lord Taiko's love for Hideyori... and lavished much flattery on Lady Yodo, all in order to expand the power of his faction. If we overlook these things, it would be tantamount to inviting disaster. I am not unaware of the matters of which you speak. But I am the Lord Taiko's legal wife. I do not want to be thought unseemly. It is because you are the legal wife that we ask you to intervene. We must destroy the conspiracy of Lady Yodo and Mitsunari. Needless to say, Lady Kita, failure to take action... will darken the futures of both yourself and the Toyotomi Clan. He was the source of the exaggerated stories about the Kampaku's conduct. Mitsunari did this in order to ensure the downfall of the Kampaku! Be careful, because you're going to be next. Your Highness, please do not be disheartened. Our Lord Taiko made you the Kampaku, Your Highness. He had given you the authority to govern. It cannot be that he truly hates you. As for the entrusted war funds... Lords Hosokawa and Da'te have paid back their loans. And Lords Asano and Mogami have said that they will be paying us back soon. As for your indulgence in liquor and the matter of the killing... I myself will apologize on your behalf, even if I have to slit my stomach. I, Hidetsugu, am a pariah after all. He will not accept my apology. But there is one thing that I cannot understand. How did they know about these matters from such a distance? Yes... I was wondering the same thing too. But I cannot believe that there is an informant in our midst. Go! Who's there?! Who are you? Who are you? Shut up and listen. Kichiya is Mitsunari's spy. The proof is that he is the grandson of wada Saemon of the Hokujo Clan... which was destroyed by Hidetsugu. Announcement! The treasury has been broken into! What, the treasury? What will we do? The audit of the treasury is tomorrow. Hitachinosuke... why aren't you saying anything? As things stand, there is nothing that we can do... except to tell the truth... and beg the Lord Taiko for clemency. What if he doesn't show mercy? If that is the case, then we have a final card to play. A final card? What are you doing? What are you doing? He was feeding information to Mitsunari! What?! What?! Read this! What if Mitsunari finds out? If he is a decent samurai... he should be ashamed of his actions. But just in case things go badly... we must play the final card. We must slit their bellies before we're made to slit ours. Kill Mitsunari? Though it is audacious, we must also kill the Lord Taiko. What?! Look at what Lord Tokugawa did. He sacrificed his own wife and children to save himself... he made victims of them! That's the way things work in a nation at war. But it's too late now. I guess Hidetsugu's as good as dead now. Next in line are Hideyoshi and Hideyori. Nah... once we destroy Hideyoshi, Hideyori will fade away. Hey Inuhachi, get me the map of Fushimi Castle. Hanzo's here. Where's Goemon? Tell him that Hidetsugu's been ordered to com- mit seppuku at Mount Koya, in three days. Goemon already knows that. Is that right? What do you say, Inuhachi? Would you like to work for the Tokugawa Clan? That's up to Goemon. Hideyori. Listen Hideyori. I did tell you that I'd let you grasp... not only Japan, but Korea and Ming, in your little hands. When you splendidly came of age... I was going to be giving you everything... that was in my power to give. Such was my earnest wish. Hideyori. Let me have a good look at your face. Come closer. Lord Tokugawa is here. Bring him here. Bring him here. Yes sir. Yodo... Take good care of Hideyori. What is the nature of your illness? At first I thought it was nothing, but I pushed myself too hard for a man my age. What are you saying? You haven't lost your color, you'll recover soon. I know the state of my own health. I want you to pledge undying loyalty to Hideyori. The five magistrates, starting with Mitsunari... along with the four elder retainers, including Maeda Toshi'ie... have all sworn blood oaths. Lord Tokugawa, I trust you more than anyone. If you support Hideyori... the Toyotomi Clan will remain strong. Lord Tokugawa... what is your answer? Even if you had never spoken of it, I had already decided... to loyally serve young Lord Hideyori as long as I lived. I shall be pleased to serve as his advisor. Now I too shall affix the seal of my blood oath. So you're sick. Hideyori... Hideyori... How pathetic. I've sacrificed everything to exact my revenge... and here lies my enemy... a dying wretch. Hideyori... Hideyori will rule the nation. Don't talk nonsense. Hideyori won't rule the nation. Listen well... It's Tokugawa leyasu who's going to rule. Who... who are you? Goemon. The great thief Ishikawa Goemon, whom you boiled in a cauldron of oil. Don't flail around. First you stole all 60 provinces of Japan. When that wasn't enough, you tried to steal Korea. You're the biggest thief of all time. Look after Hideyori? Shit on that! Who was it that killed the son of his great benefactor, Nobunaga, to take power? Suffer... And suffer some more. I will avenge my wife and son. I was going to cut off your ears, cut out your eyes... sever your nose, and torture you to death. But to you that would be like rebirth in paradise. I'm going to keep you alive instead, so that you can endure yet more suffering. Serves you right. Can't I convince you? Can't I convince you? You're being repetitive. You're being repetitive. His Highness has seized the nation. You're being repetitive. He is personally requesting that you join him. If all goes well, you could have a fief and castle of your own. Hanzo. Leyasu probably thinks that he cunningly used me to take control. But it was I who used leyasu to avenge my wife and son. Why should I care who's in charge? Where are you going? Where are you going? I don't know. Wait for me! Goemon! Wait for me!
