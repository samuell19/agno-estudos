Coming! Hurry, the school bus! I don't know what to wear. You had a dress at the wedding. Which one? The sleeveless one. With gemstones. - Where is it? On the bed. Wear it, it's classy. It's 7 o'clock. Don't be late, master. Breakfast is waiting. This? - Yes, see how classy? This is from last year. What's wrong with it? - I don't like this. Haven't you read the papers? Schools don't allow colours. Other than Grey, navy, brown, black. These aren't colours. They won't let you go in. Shangool. - Yes Is your zipper stuck? - No, man. I'm your mum. Your dad is still asleep. I can call 999 if it's your zipper. No, I'm coming. - Hurry Mr. Sharifi set off already. He'll be here soon. - Mr. Sharifi again? With the old car? Love your taste. Today is Mangool's first day. Are you listening? Mr Sharifi has promised to drive his black limo. What? Have you forgotten what it is already? The long cars. Looks like a ship from outside, a cafe on the inside. Don't jump out outside school. Wait for Mr Sharifi to open the door. Why are you holding your books? Your cup and handkerchief? - In my pocket. Why not your backpack? - That's for kids. You loved it last year. It's so pretty. - Keep it. Thanks. Get me one with a passcode. A briefcase? - Yes, they look good. Right? You're just like your dad. - I'll tell him. He loves it. Hurry. Don't moan at me, tell your daughter. Put your stuff into it. Your dad is the briefcase ambassador in the Middle East, not me. I'll take the backpack when you get yours. Are you going to go to school? - Stop chatting. What a mess. Get dressed. I have. What's this? I won't go to school. Your dress is so classy, but shame. Do you want to be expelled? I won't go to school. Okay. Mr. Sharifi is here. You're so fast, mum. But you can't handle me. Either talk or eat. - No backpacks. Whatever. Take it. Here's your lunch. Cutlets again? - No, steak. Are they the same? No, this is American meat. That's Beef Stroganoff with Russian horse meat. Remember how Napoleon loved that? Give it to Napoleon then. I prefer cows. Tell Mr. Sharifi to wait for Mangool too. Wait son. You forgot your dessert. Here's a green banana. This isn't ripe. - It will be by the time you get there. Did you hear Mangool? Mr. Sharifi is losing it. Wear your uniform. - I will in the car. I promised your principal. I did too. Your scarf. Here. Wear it. In the car Promise? - Promise. Fereshteh Vahdati. What is it now? Nothing. You forgot my share. Hello Mr. Sharifi. Nice car. How are you? Get in the back. I want to sit in the front. You're so spoiled. Hello, my master. When did you wake up? When you were running about. First day of school is an odd day. You should've seen your daughter. She was confused as to what to wear. What a play, first thing in the morning You should've become a writer, Roya Are you sure? I swear. - You're serious? No doubt. You make things out of nothing. Just like writers bringing imagination into reality. A real lie. Don't do it with the kids. They're mixing things. They've become stupid. Confused. Now that they don't have things. Or have seen things. Why not introduce them to it? They'll be desperate like us later. Your today's paper. Your plate, knife. Fork. Your electricity bill. Water. Telephone. A letter from school outside your door. Your toasted bread, salted butter. What would you like your caviar with? Lemons? - The phone bill is high. Tea or coffee? Coffee with milk and sugar or honey? I don't want any of it today. No fruit either. Just tea. Sugar cubes or sugar? Sugar is perfect cubes or raw shapes? If you love a luxury life. Why did you marry an architect? You should've asked a decade ago. You forgot to. I thought you knew how to make money. You're a true chatterbox. I've everything but money. - The main point. I didn't talk about money; it's the lack of it. Yes. But it all tends to go that way. Money. Love you, Master. Let's say money so many times. Until we make it one day. You think we will? Chanting won't work. Try on your own. Your daughter is older. Her uniform is a bad colour. It's too tight; she won't wear it. Your son's backpack is old. He moans at me. I need help myself. - Meaning? Your wallet is like our well back home. Is that a Chinese saying? - No American. Empty your bag, then hands up, face the wall. It's empty. Don't shoot. Don't worry. I want your money not your life. What's it for? - Ask how much. How much? I don't know; Will tell you tonight. Have you seen my keys? They're here. Bring it. It's mine today. Why is his backpack outside? He played a trick. He wants a briefcase. - How dare he. Your well has dried up. Hello, Susan. Hello, Susan. Hello. Hello, sir. Ferdows School. They've forgotten me. - Who cares? He forgot his jacket again. He'll be cold. It's cold. Kids don't care. It's your fault. You have to watch him. Yes. But my life is flying by. Or maybe I'm dreaming. Hi. Are you a student? No. Yes. I don't know maybe. Are you Jadidi? - No. I'm Roya Royayi. How far into the course? - Is it more than a term? What do you study? I don't. I want to learn to write. Scriptwriting! Get to class, it's started. Your teacher is shutting the door. Where do I go? This way, down the hallway. Until you get to the library. It's the first session. You might get in. Move. Loser. Shut it. Don't bother, he won't let you in. Don't look for good subjects to write. All subjects are good. There are no bad ones. We have a lot of bad writers. Good ideas are simple ones. Just like your own life. The problem is... We don't believe they're good because of it. Excuse me! Thank you. Jahan. - Yes Don't say it was me. - Don't worry, Ali. Thank you. I smell something. Say what it is. Feminine perfume, but not mine. It's me. Jahan. How come you went crazy? A writer is born. Happy birthday. Not funny. Who told you? Hello, Susan. Gossip. I didn't tell you so you'd see it in the papers. Hi, Dad. - You're up? Whose birthday is it? Agatha Christie. - Who? You don't know who Agatha Christie is? Are the flowers for him? No, I'm celebrating our misery. What has happened? Your mum got in. Where? At school? Go to sleep, nosy. You have to get up early morning. You have not seen the uniform. I'll get the vase. Get something for us to eat. Your maid has left. They go to school together. As of tomorrow. Shangool, Mangool, and Roya. Right. This course... Is a short one. To introduce you to scriptwriting. Since we're short on time, I've taken out the screening of the movie. I asked you to forget the books you've read and movies you've watched. Instead, as your first experience, go for a subject derived from your own life. Today something happened that changed my mind. Instead of the old material, I suggest you closely and patiently watch this movie. "Haji Actor in Cinema" is the first feature film in the history of Iranian cinema. Although it has been 68 years, it's still the most important movie in Iranian cinema. The director, Ovanes Ohanian, was a young Armenian man who studied cinema in Russia 68 years ago. A day like today. This movie was screened at Royal Cinema in Lalehzar. I was born on the same day, on a street named Amirieh. Your plan was approved up to here. I think it's good too. Everything about it. Other than the height of these walls. And the siege. It's 4 metres. They said it's not enough. Think of the equipment. We'll go 1 metre higher. With barbed wire. It's light and impenetrable. Good night. Bye, Jahan. A shame Roya wasn't here. I hope she's OK. Good night. - Bye. Stay, she'll be home soon. Your wife is like Saadi's daughter. God knows when she'll get back. You have to learn from Jahan. It wasn't as if she was away. You'd all go hungry without me. Enough speeches for one night. Right? Was that not enough? Get to the point. Don't go off topic. - What? You're at work in the day. You're too tired at night when I see you. Even better. Yeah, sure. He wakes everyone up with his sleep. He snores. Ali. You should've married Helen Keller instead. She was deaf and mute. Yeah, but it's too late. Helen Keller died ages ago. Shame. You'd be so happy together. Let's go, Ali. Sir. Happy birthday. Thank you. I won't bother you. It's late, I'll drive you. I live far away. It's not a parallel universe. No. But it's close. Great. Please. Have you argued against? Tell me if you've fallen out. She's here. Why can't I talk to her then? Talk to your mum. Where has she been at this time? She's worried sick. Why are you so late? I didn't know you invited guests. They all came to congratulate you. I thought it'd be a surprise. It's like an earthquake. You messed up. Get the kids. Hello Aziz. - Are you OK? Yes, I'm just really tired. Did you fight? Not yet. Why? Are you really OK? Stop repeating yourself, mum. You invited guests and forgot to come home. Pee, brush your teeth, go to sleep. You were to tell a story. Get changed. Mum, I'm so tired. I'll call later. I want to know where you've been. In class. We were watching a movie. We were worried sick and you were watching a movie? A class doesn't cause so much trouble. I'm too tired for interrogations. I'll call when I've washed the dishes. Vacuumed, and put the kids to bed. You're 33 with 2 kids. Just live your life. Once upon a time, there was a goat with 3 kids. Her son, Shangool. Her daughter, Mangool. Their house was far from the village, on a road leading to the forest. There lived a wolf in the forest. What about the third one? - His name you didn't say. It doesn't say. He probably didn't have a name. How did they call him then? - Probably no one did. How? He wasn't born yet maybe. What would you name him? Shangool, Mangool, Flowerbunch. - No. Grapes. The goat had seen the wolf around the house. She was afraid so she told the kids, "Kids," "I have to look for grass all day." "There was a drought last year," "so grass is hard to find now." "Don't be tricked into opening" "the door when I'm gone." What happens if we do? The wolf will eat you both. The goat promises the kids to knock twice first, then say, "It's me, the goat." "With two horns and four hooves." "Shangool, Mangool," "open the door." The wolf, who was hiding, heard them talking. He gets excited and goes back home. He wakes up early in the morning, goes to the market, and buys a bell. At sunset, when it gets dark, he wears the bell and walks to the door. Who is it? - Let me say it. What difference does it make? - Don't sulk. Who is it? It's me, the goat. With two horns and four hooves. Shangool, Mangool, open the door. Shangool and Mangool become suspicious of his deep voice. Shangool says, "Let's see your hooves." The wolf shows his hooves with the bell. Shangool is tricked, and as soon as the door opens the wolf jumps inside, and eats both of them alive. What's all this now? It's a story. Why are they screaming then? We got to the scary part. God help you. Or give me money to afford help. Amen. It's a shame I have to get up early. It's over. Come out. Go to bed. The rest. - That's tomorrow night. Get under the blanket before the wolf gets you. Good night. Good night. You hadn't said where you are going? We're starting the building. I have to go to the island. Do you need help? Are you a worker? No. I know how to pack. Do you want a maid? No, thanks. I can still get myself together. Thank god. There's a lot of stuff there. Bring them souvenirs so they're not afraid of you. Do I scare them or you? You've trained them to be afraid. What should I get these sheep? A pretty goat. To feed them and put them to sleep. I can't anymore. What about a wolf? Could you find it on an island? Wherever there are sheep there are wolves. Roya. What is it? Where's my underwear? In the drawer. No. Somewhere else then. Where? Laundry basket. Wash a few of them. I can't. I have homework. Someone who has homework comes home on time and studies. I felt bad, so I dropped off our lecturer. He lived so far away. Are you a cab driver? I'm a bad student who can't write stories. Who was the second Agatha Christie then? Not you? No, you have the wrong person. I'm Roya Royai the first. Tomorrow is my turn to read my story. You're so good at lying. Make something up. Our lecturer doesn't like those. He must have told you on the car ride. Yes. The truth. When was the last time you hand washed something? Where would I hang it? In the rain? I have a lot to do. I don't have socks, underwear, or pants. Wash a few so they dry by the morning. Stop, let me go first. No, you can't. Let me. Let me do it, monkey. I'll tell mum. Cheeky. Where have you been? - Hi. You could let her go. I can't, mum. - The shower. I've been waiting an hour. He won't let me take it. You're just like your dad. You don't want me to get to class. What is it? - Mr. Sharifi's Jaguar is burning. Wait, I'm late. Go on, I can hear. Your lunch is ready. What have you made? Pheasant meat and orange sauce. Wow, what else? Here's your dessert. One mango each. Wow, it smells great. Not persimmons again. Love that. One banana each so you don't fight. Don't turn on the TV until I get back. You might be afraid of the scary actors. Don't watch TV, don't go out, don't fight. What do we do? Study love. Study when you're tired of life. How many? My share. Now tell me, mum, what is it? The door is locked. Don't open the door. What would you say? Can I? Let Shangool do it. He's the man when dad is away. My mum is in the shower. The door is locked, who are you? Love it. The secret code is behind the door. Hi, Susan. No. Don't be upset. I'm late for class. I'll call you tonight. What if dad comes? - That's tomorrow I think. What about you? - She's right. I have keys. No, you have to knock. OK. Who is it? It's me, the goat. With two horns and four hooves. I'm late kids, please. Don't forget the code if anyone knocks. OK, mum. Collect your clothes, too. I didn't see you. Why? I was late. My case is a little different. I have two kids at home. When new writers struggle, they say what you just did. What is it? Are you afraid of writing? No, I know I can. Are you stuck in your story? Maybe. I think it was a bad choice for a start. I don't know what the problem is. Just as I sit to write, it's a mess. I can't get it together. I keep leaving things out. Have you spoken to your doctor about it? I'm not there yet. Is that since you attended my class? I'll find things at class to help. But when I get home, I lose all of it. Maybe what's lost is my place. You've lost your place. Or you haven't found it yet? I don't know. Before, I knew where everything was. But since I've come to class, everything is tangled. Everything requires its tools. Tools for writing aren't just pen and paper. It's a quiet space. It doesn't matter how clean or bright, but your place to think, to write to create something out of nothing. Try it. Once upon a time... The world we're in is no good for work. Everything was invented before you and me. The world of your story is the place where you invent things. If you want it to orbit, you must do it. The sun has to shine if you want it to. When not, it has to be covered. When you want rain, the sky has to. Stop it when you want it to stop. Do you have that quiet place? Shangool. Mangool. Don't bother. They've locked themselves in. What's going on Jahan? Open up, kids, it's Mum. Use the code, so they open up. It's me, the goat. With two horns and four hooves. Stop it. I'm scared to death. Did you tell them not to open the door for me? Did you break the door in? Wasn't it better if it was the death? It was pouring it down. I tried every way. You've brainwashed them. You're the kind goat and I'm the scary wolf. He asked to see my tail in the rain. I had to get to class. They were home alone. I asked them not to open the door. Look what you've done. If I get hold of them... Stop stressing. You weren't supposed to be back today. I'm sorry, ma'am. Excuse me! If I didn't call, I should've stayed at a hotel. Stop. Don't you have keys? Your problem is you're deaf. Losing sight seems next. My keys are there. In your pocket. Sorry. I didn't see them. Maybe I thought they were your office keys. Once I finish the job, I'll burn all the books there are. How epic. We have petrol right? I'll get it for you. Why didn't you wait for me? The time. What's the time? I don't know, 8 or 9. Where were you? You always pick on something else. Where are you Shangool? - Hi, Mum. Where's Mangool? Behind the bed. What is it? Has she passed out? No, she fell asleep crying. She's a girl. - What about you? So brave. Who'd be afraid of their dad? It was his fault, I swear. He said "It's me the goat". Stop. I know. We knew it wasn't you from his voice. We said you're in the shower. The door is locked. He asked to see my tail. Don't run away. - Jahan! Please. She passed out. Don't do the same to him. Put her to bed. Go to sleep if you don't need to pee. He's your dad, not the wolf. Monkey. If your mum has horns and hooves and tails. Should I have them too? You didn't say. It's best if I don't talk. This will be a long one. I get worried when you're late. What if you run someone over. Especially without a license. OK. I won't go to the cinema, the club, or dancing. Is that what I said? - No. You're smarter than that. But you try to tell me I shouldn't go to class. The club you can go to. But don't complain to Ali, Susan, and my relatives. You want to go dancing? Sure. But don't ask around my office about me. I told you it was Susan first. Then your mum. Now you know the way to my office. Your friends have your back. Did Ali tell you on the trip? Does it matter? What are you after? I want to know who you are. How long have we been married? - Over 10, 12 years. You still don't know me? Do you know me? The work you spend day and night on, is it a private villa or a prison? I have to do what I'm asked. I don't get to choose. I know that after 12 years. What I don't get is something else. Why did you lie to me? You change my words. I was kidding, that's it. Villa on the seaside? Where's the money? I'll buy a plot of land. By selling scripts, no matter what it takes. I promised the kids. - Roya Royayi, I'm behind. I have so much to do. I'm not in the mood. I don't have the time to argue. What is it? The criminals on the island have no place to go? You know what the place is called? No. Jahangir's villa. I've had it to here. They laughed at me until I got mad. I went to the airport. And got back. Here. The goat is fighting the... What's it called? Evil? - No, bad man. Thank you. Sell tickets. I'll write it at night, stick it up tomorrow. The war of the heroine goat with the badman wolf. This is where you got your ideas, Jahangir's cinema. Stop shouting. The kids are asleep. They'll be scared. I'm the actor and the audience. Should I sell tickets too? I know you can't stand it. I don't know what. Tell me if you do. Did they teach you this in class? Don't change the subject. Is it my writing or your role? You go ahead and write if you want fame. Until you make a mess. What mess? What are you afraid of? Do other writers pick their partner as their subject? Makes them look bad? This is a private place. If we can't solve it here, we can't anywhere else either. I want to speak of something I never have before. No offence. You're either positive or negative. On or off. When you agree with something, like when you're not now, you don't say why. No one ever hears your opinion. Sometimes you change. You talk like someone I don't know. You don't have opinions of your own. But you're the wise person in the house. You pick on everything I do. I'm tired of being told what to do. Who says you know better? You're wiser. How are you always right? Whoever said couples tend to be alike was either a comedian or just stupid. God forbid, if I become like you, I'll leave everything to you. This is the first time I'm writing. But when I come to the characters in my life. My dad, your mum, Aziz, or the kids. Relatives or friends. The store owners I write smoothly. I get stuck when it's you. If I try to show the real you, the audience will be repelled. What if I don't want to pass through your filter? You think I haven't tried? I've erased you, eliminated you. I kicked you out. Tore you apart. But I can't. You get back somehow. Your life is my life. You were everywhere with me. But when I go to write, my mind is blank. Jahan. At uni. Did you sell someone out? When you were poor. Did you rob a bank? Have you embezzled at work? Were you a spy before we married? You want to turn me in? No. I want to know why you're afraid of being exposed. Have you heard of serial killings? One by one. It was all me. Shame, you're new. Move over. Where are you running off to? I'm going to get water. Fear dries up the throat. I'm behind. I haven't murdered anyone in a while. You and I have to talk tonight. There's someone in the house. What a brave family I have. Go see. It's OK, Mum. Get inside and shut the door. Dad has brought back a whale. We saw him drag it into the kitchen. Were you dreaming? What whale? Get back to bed. Remember the laundry before you go out? Remember how many bags of herbs you got 2 weeks ago? The cow you made me slaughter. Now you brought back a whale? You don't want me to get to work. I wash up, clean, and cook. Can you say that 10 times? I wash up, clean, and cook ten times a day. I'm not a butcher. I need my nights like you. I'm happy with having thoughts. Who am I otherwise? Why did you marry me if you wanted a maid? You could've advertised. There are Cambodian, Philippines, and Thai. Arrest in New Serial Killings. Mum. Mum. Yes? What are you doing? I'm in the shower. Hi, Dad. You're up early. Is Mum gone? No, I'm alone. Where's Mum? Isn't she in her room? - No. Look again. Aren't you done? I am. I'm shaving. With the foam? Yes, love. I want to see you. You can't. I can just open the door. You can't, I'm naked. Dad, I want to see your face. You're so nosy. I said Mum isn't here. I looked in the room; she's not there. She must've gotten up. Look in the kitchen. Not there either. Look carefully. There's a pot she could be inside. What's taking you so long? I was filthy. Because of the whale? - Yes. Inside the pot, under the table, inside the fridge. The bins. The cabinet, she's not there. Look, I swear, she's not here. - Where's she then? The room. She sulked last night. She might be there. Mum wasn't there. Not under the table. Not behind the furniture. Your jacket was there. She wasn't inside the pockets. I just found this. Where's Shangool? - Still asleep. Wake him up. Wash up. Don't forget to brush. I'll get breakfast. Mr. Sharifi will turn up soon. Who is it? Hi, Aziz. Sorry I didn't call. It's not your first time. You wander around like a ghost. Don't whinge when I apologise. How's your leg? Great. Couldn't be better. It's as if I have no legs. I walked for so long. Where were you? At the grave. You go every week? No, I hadn't been a while. Do you feel better when you see Ahmad's grave? What can I say? You were married to him for 30 years. I don't know. No. What a loyal wife. You want tea or coffee? Sit down. I felt like having coffee. You haven't done a reading for me in ages. Go to a stranger for an accurate one. Not friends. There are things we don't know ourselves. Let alone friends and relatives. I had never seen you upset with your husband. He's gone and I'm here. I don't want to talk behind his back. But when I think: The past year he was gone, I didn't feel lonelier than before. Moreover, our 30 years of peaceful marriage was missing something all this time. Something I deserved but didn't have: Love. How could you define it when there's nothing there? The thing I can't say, can't be explained. It's either there or isn't. Get out. Get lost. What do you want? Who is it? - Spirits. God help us. Aziz, it's Roya. Ignore her. Has she lost something? Yes, sister, she has lost her brains. Aziz. Where's the thing? What's that? The thing. With the wide head, long handle. For sugar cubes? - No. Masher? Oh, the thing. - Have you seen it? No, I swear. Look in the kitchen. Check the meat. What is it? I don't know. Get up, Aziz. It's serious. Sit. She's not mental. I think she's looking for the pestle. Ours goes missing in the afternoon. Where does it go? - I hide it under my pillow. Since she attended school, she has lost it. Roya. Esmat is visiting. She's here to congratulate you. Esmat! I didn't see you. I can't see black. How are you? Lovely. I know how hard studying is with a husband and 2 kids. You're so hard-working. Congrats! For getting in. Thanks, Aziz. Thank you, Esmat. We said a week. It has been 10 days. Isn't your movie done now? Script. Who cares? Is it done or not? No, almost. Sit, Aziz. She needs to see a therapist. She has to leave tonight, before it's too late. I don't care where. What is it? Get out. Roya. What was it? A fly. Did you smash it? It was buzzing for a week. Take her to see a doctor, Aziz. Where to? I have to go; it's late. Take a seat. I'll send her away now. It's not her. It's getting dark Aziz. What about the reading? Are you in the mood? That's the main reason. The coffee is an excuse. Jahan. - Hello, Aziz. Shut it. Where are you? Weren't you supposed to come? Roya? Is she done? Enough. What is it? Is she dead? No, you're not that lucky. She's having twins. Great. - Come take her. I'm on my way. It'll take a little while. I promised to take the kids to Ali's. You'll come here first. - They're ready. They're waiting outside. I have no car today; it's at the garage. Listen, Jahan, I don't know how. You'll take your wife, then do whatever. I have to borrow Mr. Sharifi's car first. I've always stayed out of your life. But listen now. Next time you fight, you'll pack your stuff and bring the kids here. Sometimes the weather is odd. I can tell from the smell. Taxi! Taxi! How much? - 300. Will it pay for the brakes? How much are those? I stopped because of your bags. You're just greedy. Sister. What is it? You're here for the brakes? No. I'm here to say, the ones who take you for 300 aren't taxis. Taxi. Where to? - Evin. How much? - 300. Get in. Where are you going? Behind the prison. - Not enough. You're so greedy nowadays. Especially with this car. I use it for work. So you're not a cab driver? No. It's my second job. I'm an architect. What? - An architect. What a terrible job. My husband does the same. Be my guest for the fare. With dinner. Do you want dinner at home or the restaurant? Stop. We've long left. - I said to stop. Don't get mad. This is Tehran. Stop or I'll get you. OK. Roya. What is it? What are you doing? Let's go, before people gather. Now if I invite you to dinner, will you go? If you don't like the restaurant, we can go home. I hate sleazy pranks. It was the driver, not me. Do you see me? To hell with it. We'll eat at home. Why is it so dark? No one is home. The kids. Don't worry. They're with Ali and Susan. Why there? They're going climbing tomorrow. You knew I was coming home. Why did you take them there? Ali is good. Don't worry. Poor sheep. They must've lost weight when I was gone. Do you have to pick on something? I miss them. You got tired so quickly? You've sent them to the mountains to fall. Are you trying to get rid of them? I'm about to lose it. What is it? Is it a ghost? Who moved this here? I did. We're colleagues. You could've taken him in. You're trying to get on my nerves. You act as if it's me. Was there an earthquake? Or were we attacked? That's a kitchen without a woman. They've been awaiting me for 10 days? Forget it for tonight. Do it tomorrow. I swear I'd take the weekend off at the army. Tonight is the weekend. Does your dad's ghost come home then? Whatever. Are Friday nights longer? No. Just quieter. Can I see your homework? Turn on the fireplace. The house is warm. - It'll get cold. It'll rain. Is that the weather news? - No. Who then? I'm saying it. Why did you leave this here? What is it? The backpack. That's the only thing out of place? Is there enough water in the clouds. To wash my dishes? What's it called? Who? Your work. You're so impatient. Wait for now. I want to know what it's like. Nothing. Something like our life. The past few days I wrote a script, you built a prison. This is positive energy. I want to see your offspring. After all that agony. How's writing like giving birth? What? You said that. No, I know. It was something I had heard or read. I changed my mind. Wow. I don't know who said it, but it wasn't a woman. What's the difference between them? Men can't give birth. They think the pain is a lot, but I've done it twice. I think writing is harder. But it's not the same. Writing is like birth. When you write something you're reborn. You change as a person. From a different place. Does the world change? I don't know. Maybe it's me who has changed. I'm not the same Roya born 32 years ago. Today at sunset, I was born again at Aziz's house. An old, post-menopausal woman. Now I'm scrubbing. I'm wondering who I am. An intellectual or a maid. In your world, is there any oil? It stinks. Go into my backpack. What are these? The ones you wrote? Burn them. What if you change your mind? Burn them. They're just notes. Roya looks at the keys in her hand and says in shock, "Sorry". "I didn't see them." "Maybe I thought they were your office keys." Jahangir: "Once I finish the job, I'll burn all the books there are." "How epic." I think it's from the 8th scene. The night the kids didn't let the wolf in. Here. Hi, Susan. Good thing you called. I just got the phone to call. I swear you have no idea about the mess. Get one of them to talk to me. Wake them up. I miss them. They're asleep. They're going climbing tomorrow. You know what time it is? Get Shangool to call me when they wake up. You'll be asleep then. No. I think I'll be up all night. Have fun. No way. He wants to read it all tonight. What's it to you? Take a pill and go to sleep. Is this it? Hold on Susan. This was a copy. I only got one copy. I didn't have enough money. I left the other for my teacher. Where's the original? Your writing. Where's the other one? Don't move. We had an agreement. No tricks. Don't plan anything before I've read what's on your mind. This is my line. Burn it and you're dead Jahan. Who was it? Sorry Susan. Was it Jahan? Did you hear him? I can see the mess. Fool, you're the winner. He has used all his tricks, but he has lost to you. You don't seem to hear. Don't stay at home with a man in trouble, Roya. Now that you are, take a few pills and go to bed. I've had so much. I'm used to the anxiety. I feel better when I don't take anything. I feel weak when I do. You were so strong Roya. Maybe you're someone else I don't know. What messes me up is this. When I'm not anxious, they feel I'm guilty. What I don't know what it is. Grows under my skin. As if it takes over. Something odd. I'm afraid of it and promote it. Why don't you take positive thinking classes? Have you? No. That won't help me. I'm broken on the inside. You want tea? Do you need anything? Go to sleep. I'll help myself. Please. - I live far. It's not a parallel universe. - No. But it's close. Great. Please. Are you left handed? How did you know? You wrote so neatly on these unruled papers. I couldn't keep my letters on the line at school. Aren't you done? I am. I'm shaving. I want to see you. You can't. You can't, I'm naked. Dad, I want to see your face. At uni. Did you sell someone out? Were you a spy before we married? You want to turn me in? I want to know why you're afraid of being exposed. Do you have cotton balls? Alcohol. Unclench it. Unclench it. What's in your hand? You write with this hand? Don't mess about. Open it, or I'll do it. Did the kids call? No. What did you get? Everywhere is closed. Only Hussain's was open. Your toasted bread. Salted butter. Your caviar. What would you like your caviar with? Lemons? Aren't you tired? You're still sitting. I'm thinking. What about? Something new. Is it about our life again? Not my life. It's about a new life on a faraway island. No one has died yet. So there's no prison or cemetery. It's funny right? - What's it called? Jahangir's Villa?
