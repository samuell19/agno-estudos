What's your name? My name is Legion because there are many of us inside this man. Bible Top news of the hour, Congressman Guo Jinde's son has been kidnapped. No hostages have been found. According to witnesses, the possible suspect was seen on a bus towards the suburbs. The police are conducting a thorough search and asking the public to keep watch for the suspect. Find a seat and sit down. Sir, you dropped your doll. Dad. Congressman Guo Jinde's son has been kidnapped. There have been multiple kidnapping cases for the past two years, possibly by the same offender. The offender only attacks children with birth defects. His crimes are extremely obscene. Of all the bodies we've found, the defected parts were violently removed. The status of other missing children is still unknown. They are adding more police force to the search. We will do whatever it takes. He doesn't have his hearing-aid and he is deaf. Please help us. -I hear Guo Jinde's wife -Please help us. prayed everywhere and even asked the mobs for help. She has tried everything. I can tell that the chief is stressed out. Guo Jinde even got him this job. This lab is funded by his in-laws. It was originally for reviving vegetative patients or something. I believe that my child is alive. I bet the murderer is either under voodoo or a pedophile. Sit down and be quiet. Chiu Junsen. Why did you get on the bus? What were you doing before? Man, stop messing around with me. Just let me go. Does the thing in the picture belong to you? Where are you hiding the kids? I don't know. I'm just a driver. Guo Zheng, the son of Congressman Guo Jinde, has been kidnapped. The next day, the congressman received a doll soaked in alcohol. It's the same as the one found on the scene of the car crash. So we suspect that the murderer was on that bus. Mr. Policemen, you're so mean. Wang Ting. You dropped out of school and got on that bus. Why? Can I bum a cigarette? Ever since you left home, your mom has been worried about you. Nonsense. She only worries about her men. Prove it then. Tell her to come to see me. I'm on a business trip. Liao Zhi Huei, the last stop is an empty field. What business do you have there? I'm a businessman, a middle-man. I buy and sell land. The emptier, the better. Chiu Junsen said that you brought a suitcase on the bus. Is that the ransom money Guo Jinde gave you? You're trying to get me to talk. That was my third trip that day, I just wanted to get off work. I have nothing to do with whoever they are. The hostages are in danger. I'm begging you to cooperate. Eat dirt. I got on that bus so I could die. You saved my life and locked me up with these men. Now, you want me to cooperate? Who's looking after me then? Where were you going after work? Where? I wanted to see my grandma. Grandma, my foot. What did you say? Don't you dare talk about my grandma! Let me go! Get up! Officer Wang! Get up! Come here. Get up. Look at this. Look at yourself. Do you know this person? Who is he? Look at it carefully. Look. Man, stop messing around with me. Mr. Policemen, you're so mean! What did you say? Can't we discuss this nicely? I got on that bus so I could die. There were no survivors on that bus. You are already dead. You're nothing more than a monster in someone else's body. What did you do to me? Get the stabilizer, quick! Security! Where are you hiding Guo Jinde's son? Where are you hiding them? Get up! Give me the stabilizer. Officer Wang, what the heck are you doing? The stabilizer. You're just in time, doctor. Take a look. This is the doctor. After the car crash, before you went brain dead, she electro-zapped your brain, exported your consciousness, and uploaded into this brain. Making you who you are now. Do you get it? I don't either. It seems this brain still isn't right. Where are you taking me? The process of mind uploading poses a great threat to the brain. My job is to make sure the subjects are stable. Although the host Chen Guang-Xuan is in a vegetative state, we are still using his body to interrogate the five suspects on that bus. If the host's brain overloads, not only will you lose the hostages, we'll also lose his brain. I cannot allow this investigation to continue. Chen Guang-Xuan's number is 193. He was already on death row. Death was only a matter of time for him. If it weren't for this chance to find my son I lost two years ago, I would never have agreed to use this experiment for this investigation. Listen, I am in charge of this case. Stay in your pay grade. Did the last college student wake up? Lin Ziping sat in the last row of the bus. He was hit the strongest by the car crash. His operation is least likely to succeed. Do you want me here to play along with your Frankenstein game? Is someone there? Is someone there? I'm going to try and save the data from Lin Ziping's mind. But I need time. The hostages are waiting for us. How much time do you think we have? Hsu Mingzhe. Guo Zheng, the son of Congressman Guo Jinde has been kidnapped. You dropped your doll. The next day, the congressman received a doll soaked in alcohol. Hsu Mingzhe Who are you? Who are you? Write down your name. Write down your name. Chiu Junsen Chiu Junsen. You're the driver, right? You said that Hsu Mingzhe was the last one to get on the bus. Is that true? Chiu Junsen, Wang Ting, Liao Zhi Huei You couldn't confirm who I am, could you? You piece of dirt. He's Hsu Mingzhe. Every one of them has unique body language and behavior. I am the lead of this project, Shen Yiling. Your body contains multiple minds. Due to the severity of this case, we have to get everyone's conscious minds... And upload them into this brain. Why did you get on the bus? There are no more buses coming, please. Dad. Dad, where are you? Dad. Was I on my way to see my daughter? I hear a little girl calling me "Dad." Do I have a daughter? That's irrelevant. Your daughter is not the point. If you cooperate and help us find the hostages, I will make sure that you're safe. Safe? You're a saint. - What are you doing? - Calm down. Let go! - Let go! - Let go of your hands! I said let go! Let go! I just wanted to see my grandma. Chiu Junsen. Chiu Junsen. Dirty witch. Why are you locking me up with these men? Don't you know they smell bad? Doctor. - What are you doing? - Get down. I'll sue you. Get down! Have you had enough? Stay still! The revival trigger is not working. The central connection is lost. We've lost all stability in the brain. The minds are switching on their own will. Who are you? And she walked out to the red gate, the little deer with weird antlers understood that beauty should not be decided by others. Why? Because loving myself is the most important thing. That's right. Dad, they call me ugly at school. Then you call them ugly number two, ugly number three, and ugly number four. Which part of me is beautiful? Everything about you is beautiful. Dad. Dad, where are you? Dad, help me. Dad, where are you? What malfunctioned? Just like past experiments, as time goes on, the foreign minds will start to take control. Take control? If the vegetative host isn't awake, the foreign minds will take hostage of the body. If everyone agrees, that's what we'll do. If we can't escape, I won't be able to see grandma. I just want to see my daughter. I think she's in danger. Can I go see her? Or maybe she can come to see me. Please? Is he a hostage? Have you seen him? Did he wear a hearing aid? You can see the others' memories, can't you? I just see a little girl giving him a doll, and they walked into the park together. I saw another boy at the park, wearing a red keychain around his neck. What park? Where? It's not a community park. It's a huge park. Whose memories are you seeing right now? - How old is the little boy? - I remember now. I got on the bus to see my daughter. Do I have a daughter? Your profile shows that you have a daughter. But we're not talking about that right now. Your daughter is not important. Find the security camera footage of every park in the city. Yes, sir. Tell me what the little girl looks like. I don't know what the girl looks like. Can I see my daughter? I hear her calling me for help. Can I see her? I need to know what the little girl looks like. I already told you that's how I see it in my brain. This is the last seen footage of Guo Zheng. We've checked all the security camera footage in the park. None showed Guo Zheng and the little girl. Within the three-mile radius of Zhongshan Park, there are six schools. Get to these schools now. Find every little girl with the same height and ask if they've seen Guo Zheng. - Yes. - Yes. Officer Wang, maybe we should keep talking to Hsu Mingzhe. He gave a reliable tip. We can trust him. Just with one tip, and we're not even sure if it's real, and you already believed him? He could be tricking us. Maybe he's the murderer. Dad, where are you? Dad. Hand it to me. I can get more information out of him. Doctor, leave these dirty jobs to us. You just mind your own business. Okay? Just let me see her. Please. What do you think you're doing? He was diagnosed with autism at two years old. He never spoke to anyone. That morning... Missing child, Shen Zijie, went missing in Zhongshan Park ...I hung the keychain on his neck with my own hands. For the first time, he called me "Mom." I told him that he had to wait for me to pick him up after school. When I got to his school, he was gone. Three days later, police found a security cam footage. A little girl brought my son into the park. It sounds just like what he said. You know very well that after all this time, your son's chances of survival... I don't care. Whether my son is dead or alive, I need to find him. Doctor, you should know that I have the authority to remove you from this case. Judging by your emotional state, you are incapable of making rational decisions. I cannot risk this whole case for you alone. Your boss put me on this investigation. If you remove me from this, I will take my team and 193 with me. I've seen you do your job. Everyone is telling a different story. Only Hsu Mingzhe can describe memories that are actually true. That means he can see the others' memories. What are you saying? We can use Hsu Mingzhe and make him our informant. How? Why would he help us? Use Chen Guang-Xuan's body as a bargain. That murderer is still in your brain, using the same body as you are. If we let you see your daughter, it will put her in danger. Please, I'm begging you, I just want to see my daughter. Okay? If you cooperate and help our case, we will delete all the other minds in this body, give you a new identity, and escort you to your daughter safely. But you need to get into that brain and find useful information for us to crack the case. If you help me solve this case, I will bring your daughter to you immediately. When you enter the deeper level of consciousness, this injection will help strengthen your memories so you could find more information. The risk is the others will be able to see your memories. I just want to see my daughter. Office Wang has sent someone to get your daughter. When you wake up, you'll see her. Why is the little deer beautiful? Because she believes in herself. What have we learned from this? I have to believe in myself. Who are you? You've seen the man who's hiding, haven't you? Who the heck are you? I'm Liao Zhi Huei. Chiu Junsen, Liao Zhi Huei Liao Zhi Huei. Have you seen that man too? I couldn't see his face. He told me that the officer and the doctor were all lying. When this is over, they'll destroy this body. He said that it's up to ourselves to find an escape. When the time comes, he also said that he'll help us. Do you recognize this? This doesn't matter. I've made a deal with Chiu Junsen. Wang Ting stole an injection shot for us. I've hidden it under the plant. You'll distract the doctor. Then let him take care of you guys. They've promised to let me see my daughter. Is there a cure for your stupidity? Did the officer promise you the body? He told everyone the same thing. Don't be so dumb. Here, pause. And this part here. I see a room. It could be where the hostages are kept. I hear water and a running motor. There's a guy... Officer. Did you go see my grandma? I'm talking to Hsu Mingzhe, get back in there. Darn, that means no. Do you think I'm an idiot? I want to talk to Hsu Mingzhe. Stay out of this. The deal we made last time, is it still good? What deal? You said if I get you information, I can take over this body. Do you have information? Do you? I also hear water and motor. I also see a set of numbers, 413, and needles everywhere. What's 413? What's 413? It could be a warehouse. How would I know? I'm not a police officer. Don't mess with me. Is the deal still good? Hello? Did you find Hsu Mingzhe's daughter? What do you say? It looks like he really lost his memories. He doesn't even remember his daughter is dead. We have to keep this a secret from him. Got it? They're all lying. Doctor. Room 193's alarm is on. Do you want to wait for Officer Wang? Hsu Mingzhe. You are Hsu Mingzhe, aren't you? How are you feeling? Where's my daughter? I'm not briefed on their investigation process. Are you messing with me? Are you messing with me? What are you doing? Let go of her. Who are you now? You said you'd bring my daughter to me. Where is she? Calm down. Let go of her. Liao Zhi Huei said we'll all be deleted and no one will survive. Hsu Mingzhe, calm down. - Officer Wang has promised... - Shut up! Back off! Back off! I will not trust any of you again. Don't do anything stupid. Close the door! Open the door! Open the door! Where are you going? Open up! Where's the exit? Hsu Mingzhe! Don't come any closer. No! I'll get you out of here. Chiu Junsen! Let go of me. Get in. Get in! You want to play? Let's do it. Come on! Awesome. Go away! Doctor. I really have something to ask you. Can you help wake my grandma as well? My grandma has been in a coma for two years. I work very hard as a driver, but the money is not enough for her medical bills. Maybe we can go to the hospital now. Can you upload my grandma too so we can be together? That way, she wouldn't have to suffer. Who brought this witch in? I thought Chiu Junsen is going to drive? Come here! You drive. They're so crazy. Wait, am I doing this right? Am I doing okay? Shut up all of you. Let me go find my grandma first. It doesn't matter what you want to do... Can we focus on business? Stop messing around. Let me drive properly. Get off. This body is useless to me. I got on that bus so I could die. And I can't even do that. The deer with the weird antlers got out of the red door. She never has to hide again. She isn't afraid of being laughed at. You've seen my memories. Your daughter is really cute. Be careful of the others. What are you saying? Don't get close to my daughter! I found the door first. Stay out of my way. What are you still doing here, witch? Why are you following us? Get off the car. Wang Ting. Wang Ting. Get out. Calm down. Get away. - Wang Ting. - Are you done? Get out. Dad is coming to get you. I'm coming. I'm coming to rescue you. I... Dad is here. Hsu Mingzhe. Are you okay? Is there a cure for your stupidity? Something this easy, yet I have to do it myself? Darn, I'll get the money myself. What a bunch of idiots. I told you to not leave and keep a 24-hour watch on that host body. If the press finds out, you are so dead. You put me in charge of this place. Sure. I quit. How is that? Just because you solved a few cases, it doesn't make you important. You want to quit? You can't! Your team lost the host body. If you can't find it, you're all fired! Get me the location of the doctor's car. Go! Yes, sir. Big Head, it's me. Untie me first. This doesn't look good. Please. What the heck? You called me Big Head? Who are you? How do you know I'm here? I'm Liao Zhi Huei. It's me, Liao! You're Liao Zhi Huei? Yes. Do I look like an idiot to you? Liao Zhi Huei is dead. The news reported that the car crash killed him. My body isn't Liao Zhi Huei, but my brain is. Look. You're full of nonsense! What the heck are you talking about? Who are you? Last month, we went to get rid of your pain in the butt. Darn you! Baldie, come. Big Head. - Let me explain. - Take care of him. Beat some sense into him. No seriously, I'm Liao Zhi Huei. Please untie me, and I can explain... Darn... Sir, he's acting dead again. Liao Zhi Huei told me to come. I'm asking you one more time, who are you? What did Liao say to you? He only told me to get the money. He said if I don't get the money, I'll tell the police that you kidnapped the children. That college boy took the kids. I have nothing to do with it. I only deal with money with Liao Zhi Huei. So they're accomplices? How would I know? He told me to divide the money into four. Do you know where the kids are? Darn, how would I know? I'm no psychic. Drop dead! Baldie. Get rid of him. Baldie! Darn it, kill him. Liao said if I took care of the money, he'd take care of the kids. You're never shown up before. Who are you? Lin Ziping. Don't come any closer. No! Lin Ziping, let go of me! Darn, I'm Liao Zhi Huei. You said Lin Ziping is dead. Didn't he fail to upload? I'm just here for the money, but they caused a scene. You know the location of this ransom. You're all accomplices. Don't say that. I'm only in charge of the money. We only contacted each other online before this. I don't even know what they look like. Tell me, where are the children? I told you. I have nothing to do with the kidnapping. The way I see it in this brain, the crazy chick is in charge of the kidnapping. And you think you're innocent from all this? I just want to take my share of the money. Take it back home, be a good husband and a good father. All of this will be none of my business. So shut your mouth. Do you hear me? Put your hands behind your head! Everyone on that bus is an accomplice. Why are you dragging me down with them? I just want to see my daughter. Hsu Mingzhe, - your daughter... - Don't move! Hsu Mingzhe! Sir, are you okay? Guojing, hurry! - We need backup. - Move aside! - Move away! - Sir! Why are you following me? My son has been kidnapped. Four accomplices are inside your brain. Like you, I just want to find my son. Just don't let me fall asleep. I don't know where these monsters are taking us. Hsu Mingzhe. What are they doing? Wang Ting. I know you're in charge of the kidnappings. Once the kids were drugged, I only took the kids to Lin Ziping. Did you take my son? I don't know what your son looks like. Two years ago, he went missing in Zhongshan Park. He was wearing a blue backpack. I gave him a red keychain. Do you recall seeing him? Wang Ting. I really envy your son. His mother doesn't give up looking for him. Can you tell me the truth? All those kids are probably dead. I'm sorry. The chief is getting desperate. You still haven't found the hostages. Now, you're screwing up my job. We just found out they're all accomplices. Good. We just received orders to shoot-to-kill 193. We haven't found the kids. We cannot kill him. We can't keep the press down anymore. The killer is in that body, once we take him out, it's all over. How do I find the kids with him dead? Hey! You old piece of dirt. Sir, we found security camera footage. Left-handed. One of the consciousness was in disguise the whole time. Why did you save me? You monsters! This is all my fault. If I wasn't so afraid and was more careful, he wouldn't have died. Keep blaming yourself, it won't bring back your son. The most important thing now is to find where they hid the children. Then delete all these minds, so I can go find my daughter. Once the minds are uploaded, they cannot be undone. But... But you said if I find hostages, you'll give me control of the body. My research has not yet been able to externally remove the consciousness. I'm sorry. You're sorry? What are you saying? I'm asking you, what the heck? What do you mean by that? My daughter is still waiting for me. You put me together with these monsters! You will see your daughter. Let's find the children. Sir, we found the car in the river. There are no passengers. Also, Guojing found Lin Ziping's address. You guys go ahead. I also hear water and motor. I also see a set of numbers, 413, and needles everywhere. I saw another person in the brain. Is it Lin Ziping? The money launderer said that Lin Ziping took away the kids. Wang Ting mentioned it as well. Only Lin Ziping knows where the kids are. To find the kids, we have to find him. Besides me, everyone else is an accomplice. But we cannot rule out that I might be the murderer of your son. The only way is to get into this brain to find out the truth. Eat children's meat Promise me, no matter what the truth is, find my daughter. I promise you. Defected offsprings are not acceptable for the Almighty Congressman's son, Guo Zheng, has a defected ear. Down syndrome, harelipped Junsen's route He's coming for us. He tricked us to get on the bus. He's going to kill all of us. Do you mean Lin Ziping? Wang Ting Wang Ting, Zhi Huei, Junsen Ziping Mingzhe Hsu Mingzhe. Listen, Lin Ziping isn't the murderer because he's missing an entire left arm. It was a leftie who killed the money launderer. The one who has been pretending is not Lin Ziping. Who has been pretending then? He's going to kill us all. Who? I don't want to play anymore. Please just let me go. I don't want to play anymore. I want to go home. We forgot there's one more person. The mind of the host body, the death row inmate, Chen Guang-Xuan. Lin Ziping. How long are you going to keep me tied up? What is this place? Where are you hiding the kids? Hsu Mingzhe took the kids. I took the kids? Where did I take them? Who are you? I'm Hsu Mingzhe. You weren't even on that bus. What do you mean I wasn't on the bus? Let me go! I'm just following his orders. I recruited the team online, kidnapped the kids, and hid them away. I didn't have to do anything else. We all get paid in the end. He wanted me to get everyone on that bus. Who is he? Hsu Mingzhe. I am Hsu Mingzhe. You're not Hsu Mingzhe. Who are you? I thought we agreed not to tell others about me? Who are you? Who am I? Silly. Chen Guang-Xuan, you don't even recognize your own body? You sneaked into all of our minds. Dad. That made you forget your own memories. Where are you? They call me ugly at school. Let me tell you what you've done. Do you remember your wife hiding your daughter from you? Four years ago... There are no more buses coming, please. You got on the bus of the same route. Find a seat and sit down. You wanted to go see your daughter. Loser! I'm fed up with you, loser. Why don't you go to die? Why don't you just die? I'm coming, baby. Don't be afraid. Hello? Please, I'm begging you... Beg me? Are you happy being drunk like this every day? You found your wife. Kill me then. - You're sick. - You're weak. Loser. You're sick. You killed her. But you failed to kill yourself in prison. You went into a vegetative state. You're the murderer, Chen Guang-Xuan. I am Hsu Mingzhe. Once I kill you, the body will belong to me. But... I will go see your daughter for you. Don't worry. It will be just like how I visited the other kids. You think you're innocent, but you're just like us, a monster. Didn't you say that Hsu Mingzhe's daughter is dead? That's correct. The one who has been asking for his daughter is Chen Guang-Xuan, not Hsu Mingzhe. The doctor's experiment has woken up the vegetative subject. We were all tricked. Untie me first. Okay. Hsu Mingzhe. Are you okay? What happened? I'm not Hsu Mingzhe. Who are you? I'm the vegetative patient, Chen Guang-Xuan. I'm the one you've been following, not Hsu Mingzhe. Where's Hsu Mingzhe? Tell Officer Wang Zhicheng to bring me my daughter alone. I want to see my daughter. Only I know where the kids are. Little girl. Chen Guang-Xuan. Where's Guo Zheng? I remember my daughter now. She has always looked a bit different. Everyone called her a monster. But the real monster is this world. What are you saying? They never should've been born. Your son and my daughter. I'm here to save them. Ziteng. Ziteng. Dad. Dad. Grandma said you were dead. Chen Guang-Xuan, you've seen your daughter. Now, tell us, where is Guo Zheng? You're even prettier than in your dad's memories. That's not Chen Guang-Xuan! Chen Ziteng! Let's go! - Come on! - Dad! Chen Ziteng! Trust me, come with me. Let's go! Hurry. Hsu Mingzhe, you're insane. You even killed your own daughter, didn't you? This world Went missing at Xinyan Elementary School never had a place for them. Missing for 10 years By killing them, I'm doing them a favor. You know I'm right. Hurry, let's go. Ziteng, listen to me. Hold my hand and don't be scared. Come on. Ziteng, go! Hurry up and go. Ziteng. It's Dad. They called you a monster and that made you sad, didn't it? Don't be afraid. I'm here to help you. Dad, help me. Dad! Dad, help me. Dad! Dad, help me. Let go of her! Be patient, you're going to see your son soon. Come here. Baby. Baby. Baby. Baby. Ziteng! Baby. Dad, what happened? I don't know how to explain. Baby, I missed you. You've grown so much. I'm sorry. This is all my fault. I'm sorry. Dad, I'm scared. Can we go home? Dad can't go home yet. Do you remember the story of the deer with the weird antlers? Yes. It said to believe in myself. Promise me, no matter how the world sees you, you have to believe in yourself, okay? Okay? Who's the prettiest? Me. - Who? - Me. Is it you? Yes. The man who killed your son is still in my body. Dad, will you be with me forever? Of course not. Once you get a boyfriend, you won't need me anymore. Dad. Sure. I will be with you forever. Dad. Are you in a rush to leave? No. Ziteng's class is over soon. I'm picking her up. I heard about it. You adopted his daughter. That's good. That's pretty good. Before you leave, sign this NDA. They've spoken to the congress and promised that your research funding will not be challenged again. You've succeeded. But regrettably, you woke a murderer. The patient's name is Chen Guang-Xuan. He helped the police solve a case, saved his daughter's life, and helped me find the truth about my son. So you think we should keep this monster? He was just a father trying to see his daughter again. He's a monster we created. That's a fact. In reality, no one cares what monsters think. By killing him, we're doing him a favor. You are talking exactly like Hsu Mingzhe. Doctor, tomorrow's revival process will begin at 10 a.m. Have you found a successful method? Not yet. But Chen Guang-Xuan has woken up before, I believe there's a chance. Project host: 193
