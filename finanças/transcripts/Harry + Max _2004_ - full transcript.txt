These are amazing. Nikki's unbiased opinion. I'm sorry, the little buggers deserve to die. Have you even tried the copper? Slugs won't cross copper. A giant banana slug will. I tried it. I tried hot pepper spray... I tried insecticidal soaps... Hell, I even tried a bowl sunk in the ground with... ...beer in it. Some creatures just don't know what's good for their underbellies. Viva los tomatoes. Exacto. Perhaps Max should consider a shower before he leaves. Is that a hint? Tomorrow I shall bathe in a fresh mountain stream at dawn. Suit yourself. It's going to be freezing. Wish you were coming. No, I think I'll wait for film at eleven. Well, suppose we do run into a bear... or a bobcat or something, huh? Well, then you'll see how fast your brother runs for cover. God bless him. -Uhhh... -A little waxing's... -...good for everything. -No! ♪ You got me...

So what's the band think? Well, they're willing to make it their Harry quota... I mean, if the label wants it as a single. Well, that's good, right? Fuck yeah, that's good! It's my first single in two albums, bro. Right on. Tell me what you think. Honestly. I think you should be writing shit that's more real. I tried that. You remember 'Rocket to the Moon'? It didn't even make it on the album. I didn't even like 'Rocket to the Moon'. Give the little girls what they want. Yeah, well, it's what I want too, and they pay for it. So what's the problem? How far we got left anyway? Uhm... maybe 20 miles. Fucking Shackleton. What's the temperature supposed to go down to tonight? Did you check? Uhm... we got everything we need. Trust me. You know, you're lucky you over pack. I never have what I need. Scouting... Never had time for it. Well, you could have. You had time for your rockets. I liked it when you took me to fly your rockets. Mom was afraid I'd maim you. She didn't give a fuck if I maimed myself, though. But you showed me anyway. Well, you stopped once the band started. Well, I had to, Max. I had to practice. It's not like they hired my sorry ass for its musical ability. I learned. That's what counts, O.K.? That's open to interpretation. Oww. O.K., O.K., O.K., O.K., O.K. You're goddamned right I learned! Big difference between you and me, work. That's not the only difference, Harold. I didn't say it was. Sorry. You know, you're always apologizing for something. Were you displaced when I was born? Oh God, what stupid book are you reading now? Nothing. I'm just curious. You know, when you were born, I thought it was like the greatest thing... to ever happen to this family. Yeah, right. Seriously. Can you even imagine that kind of excitement? Having a little brother? I think I was a pain in the ass. Not to me you weren't. I think I was a pain in the ass. At least you didn't throw your shit at mom and dad. You did that? Literally? I think so. I got accused of it, anyway. Why? Why'd I do it or..? How am I supposed to remember? Well, it seems to me that there's a number of possibilities: one, uhm, mom, you aren't taking care of my shit... mom, you are shit... uh, help me, I'm drowning in shit. He's a little baby, he ain't got a lot of words, but he's sure got a lot of shit. -The shit, that's dirty. -You're dirty. You're dirty. Dirtier and dirtier. -Awww... -Dirty... -Bi-otch. -Bi-otch. Dude, you've got to put up all the pins before it stands up. Fine, then you do it. A two-year-old could do this, you know. If you say so. Dinner's ready. I thought we were supposed to be roughing it. It's the Tri-Star Room. It's the best in Burbank. Yeah, but I thought we were going to cook... veggie burgers over the fire and smother them in A-1. Why can't I buy my brother the best dinner I can find? Seeing as The Alpine Tavern closed 70 fucking years ago. Jesus, what did I say, Max? Nothing, you didn't say nothing. Is it the Alpine Tavern? Because you know we're going to go see the ruins tomorrow, right? Last time we had dinner was some fancy place in New York. Yeah, Balthazar. It was supposed to be a family dinner, and then it turned into this monster thing with Roxanne... and your label people and a bunch of your New York friends... I'd never met, plus the winner of the latest... fucking "Have a Date With Harry Contest". I didn't even get to talk to you that night. Well, it wasn't supposed to be like that. Why couldn't you just tell them no? If you'd have been in town longer, Max, I would have had dinner with you every night. I put my money where my mouth is, didn't l? I came 2,000 miles to see you, right? I'm honored. I just wish that l'd brought the "K-rations". K-rations? Yeah, did you know that the guy that invented K-rations... was this 82-year-old gay veteran activist dude who just died last year? -Good for him. -His name was Herb King. He went to M.I.T. where I want to go. At like a really young age he invented this Power Bar... for the troops in World War Two. How do you know all this? Modern Lifestyles class. You ever thought of going back to public school? Fuck you, why can't l have positive role models? I'm just kidding, jeez. -Who are your role models? -Musical or non-musical? I don't know, role models in life? Well, dad I guess. Until I realized he wasn't allowing himself... to do what he really wanted to do. Dad couldn't afford to do what dad wanted to do. Yeah, well, he let me down, Max. He hasn't had to worry about money for a long time... and he's still not doing it. I mean, what is the point of writing good stories... if he's not going to make that agent work for him? Do you think he should have stayed at Lockheed until the plant closed? Yeah, maybe he should have. I'm not saying I know. But I got him that agent for a reason. He'd be stupid not to take your help. Yeah, and he resents me for it. Are you sure about that? Look what it did to his self-esteem. He probably hates you staying away more than anything else. There's a reason I stay away and they both know it. You've got to talk about this shit with them, man. It's pretty simple from my point of view. Can I have some now? Don't get drunk. It's cold. Tell me about it, Shackleton. Do you think this was a good idea? Of course this was a good idea. This ain't Bermuda. No. Do you want to do that again? What, go to Bermuda? No, do what we did in Bermuda? We got to be a family again in Bermuda. Yeah... It was only two summers ago. I think about it all the time. What? What did I say? I don't know how l feel about Bermuda. Max. Max. Is that good? That's not the point. You've got to sh... Show me. No, I'm not giving you a blow-job. You've got to sheathe your teeth, you understand? Am I as good as Roxanne? Who ever said she knew how to suck a dick? Don't make me feel stupider than I already do. You kiss better than you suck dick? I've had a lot of practice kissing. I'm sure you have. I need more practice sucking dick. Well, you're not getting it from me. You know, if I weren't your brother it might be different. I mean, if I liked boys and I weren't your brother. I mean, there's nothing wrong with liking boys. It's just that... I like Roxanne. You're not sounding very convincing. How's that? -That's rad. -Good. Can we go to bed now? Tactile contact doesn't always have to end up in orgasm. What class is that from, Max? None. And who all are you tactile with? Various friends. You know, I don't mind if you whack it. It's O.K. In fact, I'd kind of prefer if you whacked it. Might help you get some sleep. I can do that anytime. How often do I get to sleep with my brother? There's nothing wrong with sleeping together, Max. -Was that a bear? -Go to bed, Max. Hey, you know every hotel we're staying at in Japan has a gym? I think I'm going to start working out again. All the gyms in the world wouldn't make up... for the shit that you put in your body. True. Why don't you do yoga? I mean, you could do yoga on your tour bus, in the hotel room, wherever. I don't like how it makes me feel. How's that? I don't know, like I'm coming apart at the seams. Come again? Just brings a bunch of shit up. Feels like it's pulling me apart. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. Well, maybe yoga's not for everybody, you yoga-Nazi. Maybe your body's trying to tell you something. Excuse me for coming up like this. I read your interview in Teen Bopper a couple of months ago. Oh yeah? It was so good... I can't tell you. I guess if they give you a soap box to stand on, you stand on it, right? You're going to do more music, I hope. I don't know. I mean, that first album kind of freaked me out. I mean, the idea that people actually bought it freaks me out. That I had to perform it really freaks me out. I mean, it's not like I'm him, right? What's wrong with being me? Nothing. That's what I'm saying. You're the rock star in the family. I can't believe I'm sitting here with you guys. I was wondering if you could autograph... Best wishes... Max. That's so beautiful. All this used to look like that. Well, enjoy your hike back down. We will, thanks. Bye. Lay off. God, was she for real, or what? What, just because no one's interested in your flabby ass no more? Yeah, well, you're a fuckin' oddity. It's no wonder you get so much attention. Oddity? Yeah, I mean, a guy like you, picture in the teen mags. Of course you're a fucking oddity. What's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying, you know, sooner or later you're gonna... run out of energy for girls like that. Especially when they're not sincere. She seemed pretty sincere to me. Yeah, right. A girl her age going for a boy your age. You weren't complaining when you were my age. What would you do if you had to go down on her? Dude, she asked for my autograph, not head. She wants you because she thinks you're unspoiled. And she doesn't want you hurting her. And most of all she wants you clean. Circumcision really fucked with your head, dude. Like I had any choice about it. Chill out, it's not the end of the world. Yeah, well, you know it's a sore subject with me. You don't think I'd pay a million fucking bucks... to have my foreskin back? Hey, mind your own business, bitch! Wait until that hits the National Enquirer. You wouldn't use that word in front of mom, would you? Yeah, well, she is one most of the time. Fucking sanctimonious, tee-to-talitating bitch. Why don't we head over this way? Trying to run my life too? You call Roxanne a bitch when you're fucking her? Yeah, I call her a bitch sometimes, when she needs to be called that. The misogynist rears his head. It's a lovemaking thing, Max. You gotta talk nasty sometimes. What does she say to you, Casanova? She says, 'You're a bad little dog, and you're going to lick my snatch until... I tell you you can stop, you bad little dog'. And then you know what she does? She wraps her legs around my neck like this, and she won't let me up until I make her come, and fortunately for me I know how. 'Lick my box, Rover. Ahh...ahh...' That's what she says. -She calls you a dog? -All the time. I'm just trying to give you an example of how a woman... will behave when she's aroused. I'm not sure I want to know any more. Hey... How'd this whole thing turn out so fucking stressful, anyway? Just listen to the breeze, man. Let it calm you. Yeah, you're right. Maybe I need some pussy. Medication time. Don't go all 12-step on me, Max. How come you always get with girls that medicate you? You think I haven't wondered that myself? Mom says that you should let your addictions speak to you. You know, you're a lot like her, despite of what you think. Yeah? How's that? Work ethic. You're both workaholics. You think could have gotten this far by being lazy? No. But you've got to stop and do shit for yourself, man. It's like with Nikki... Does she still live in Burbank? Yeah. She's back from Boulder. Back from that guy that she married and then dumped her. Well... I wish she would have called. Why does everyone have to call you, man? Why can't you call them? I mean, if she was in trouble, she should have called. It didn't help that you had a reputation, a reputation for fighting and shit. Once that stuff gets printed, Max, you never live it down. Why don't you tell her yourself? Tell her that it wasn't true. She tends bar at the Purple Parrot. I mean, with Nikki, how was I supposed to know what was right? You love someone, your good sense goes right out the window. I love you, man. You know that, right? Yeah. I don't really feel like talking about it, though. You saying that because of the shit I said before... or because of last night? That was just playing around, right? It didn't seem like you were playing last night. I mean, how serious can we be? It's not like I can date you. You ever thought of loving an older man? You have, haven't you? Huh? You've been with older men, haven't you? I mean, excluding Bermuda. I don't know if you'd say that. Stop being coy and talk to me. -Did something bad happen? -No. -Did something good happen? -I guess you could say that. You know who got me into yoga, right? Yeah, your yoga teacher. Josiah Smith. You still see him? No. I'm surprised he didn't offer you private lessons. -He left the school. -Why, because of you? -I don't know. -Yeah you do, come on. Well, what would the school have said if they had found out... he was getting with me, huh? He's not allowed to do that shit. Man, leave it alone. How old is he? -40. -40?! This guy must know something I don't. -Where's he live? -Near Palmdale. He runs the Jasper Valley Live Oak Preserve. Yeah, Jasper Valley... did he stop molesting boys? He never did that. Yeah, it sucks that you don't think there was... anything wrong with what he did. I was the one who started it, O.K.? Yeah, and he acted on it. He shouldn't have. -You did. Last night. -That's different. I'm your brother, Max. -And 40's too old, O.K.? -How would you know? Have you ever had a male lover? I don't want to talk about it. Then don't throw stones, dude. Yeah, I've had men after me. Rude and lecherous men. Did you do shit with them? Sometimes I had to. It didn't mean nothing. What do you mean "had to"? Like for work and stuff. Was there ever a guy that you...really cared about? Just find me a fucking hotel, O.K. Spores... Spores? Other people's drool spores. You don't want to breathe them. They nest in the filling. -Thanks. -Sure. That's better, right? Yeah, you're like the perfect little wi... travelling companion. You were about to say 'wife'. -No, no I wasn't. -Yeah, you were! -No I wasn't. -Yeah you were! No... -Want to smoke some pot? -No. -ls it O.K. if I do? -Sure. -You don't like pot? -No. Drunks don't like pot. I can't speak for other drunks, Max. We had pot in Bermuda. I just like being naked like that on the beach and all. Yeah, well, this ain't Bermuda. Besides, I can't do that shit anymore. Somebody's going to take a picture of me all fat and shit. I'm sorry I called you fat before. I am kind of fat. No you're not, man. No? Do you want to sleep in my bed tonight? It's like you're a different person than when you were little. I mean, don't get me wrong. That's a good thing. It's no big deal if we sleep in the same bed. It would be like the worst thing that could ever happen to me, you know? Somebody found out about us? It wouldn't be that great for me either. Yeah, it wouldn't matter for you. Nobody's going to stop liking 'Max'. So when did you first want it, anyway? -With you? -Yeah. When I was like 7. You're kidding, right? There was this one Saturday morning and we were both in bed. The dog was scratching at the door to get in... and making a lot of noise. I pretended not to hear him. You got out of bed with no clothes on and had this big boner... I wanted to check it out. God. Now I feel guilty for making you gay. I already knew what I wanted. -When you were 7? -Yep. I had no clue. You don't remember? I showed you my boner after that. Dude, you were always walking around naked. It didn't faze me, it wasn't sexual. It was sexual. I wanted you to touch it. Yeah, well, that definitely was not going to happen. You know you could have had me whenever you wanted. That's why it eventually happened in Bermuda. Like I gave you permission. -Hey, waddup? -Where are you? I'm at some dump at the base of the mountain. -How's camping? -lt got too cold. We're leaving tomorrow, though. All right, you think I could call you back another time? -Yeah, as in later tonight? -Uh, how about tomorrow? -Where are you? -We're at Galapagos. We just finished dinner. -I miss Galapagos. -Then get the fuck home. I gotta go. Hey... I'm leaving Wednesday, you know? I know...Iove ya. -Yeah... What the fuck? Love you too. Come on, let me drive for a while. -Nope. -Yes. -Nope. -Yes. -Nope. -Yes. -Nope. -Yes. Not a mile over the limit. -Bi-otch. -Bi-otch. I'm not asleep, you know. Just concentrate on driving, Max. -You liked it, right? -It's all good. I just don't want to die. Didn't you say that yoga guy lives near Palmdale? Yeah, you want to turn off? Not now. I'm sure he'd love to meet you. Another time, Max. ? You are my all. ? ? Always take care. I can look but I can't stare. ? ? And there are times, when I am low ? ? I think of you girl. I want you to know. ? ? The better one, Just holding on. ? ? I watch your garden grow so strong. Hmmm... ? Party at the hotel? Tuesday? We'll see. Can I bring Nikki? Tsss... Get out of here. -Hi. -Hey. How are you doing? Man, you're falling apart here. Are you going to visit him in Japan? Mom thinks that I should stay here... with all the stuff that I've got going on this summer. No, Japan would be great for you. God, can't she see that? Maybe we could go somewhere this summer, you and me. Maybe somewhere closer than Japan. Like San Diego. We could see the panda bears. That's so fucking warped, panda bears in San Diego, a hundred degrees out? But they're so cute with their little markings... and their little noses. Yeah, like little teen idols. I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. So how's he doing, Max? Is he happy? The band's at each other's throats. It's like if their album sells, then everyone forgets for a little while longer... just how badly they want out. -Josiah? -Yeah? Hey. I'm Harry. I'm Max's brother. Yeah, I know, hi. -New hair. -Always. -Is he O.K.? -Yeah, yeah he's fine. I'm glad. So where are all these live oaks... I've been hearing so much about? He loves them live oaks, Max. So index on the second fret, or the second dotted part... -Right. -'A'... -That one? -Yeah. Then the middle finger, third string up, and the... other two right above it. -Like that? -Yeah. -Ooh...almost. -That was close. -No, it's no use. -O.K. Look, why don't l just write some words. -Sure. -O.K. ? Sittin' in Nikki's apartment while I learn to play the guitar... ? What are you..? I was watching the E Channel. -You ever watch E? -Sometimes. They had this piece about you and your management company, something about bad blood. Oh yeah? Yeah, how did they put it? It was really funny. 'The last couple of years you've spent more time... suing people in court than Raymond Burr in the entirety of his career.' A guy like me has to watch out for himself. The music business is in the shitter, in case you didn't know. Yeah, I heard. So... to what do I owe this visit, Mr. Burr? Well, Josiah, I was hoping you could straighten me out. -Straighten you out? -Yeah. I mean, I'm conflicted. I thought I might turn to you for advice. Nice. -I don't blame him. -For what? Loving you. -Like he still does. -Fuck you. I've seen it with my own eyes. -Seen what? -His regret. Think about Max. What does he need from you right now? Does he need a sexual relationship? If I were you l'd be asking myself why... I'm looking to him for that. Maybe you could talk to him. For what purpose? To find out how he feels, to see if he wants me... the same way I want him. And what makes you think he'll tell me? Might take the pressure off, third party and all. Max and I have boundaries at this point. Do you understand why that's important? No. The way I see it, we're in this together. We both love Max and we both want what's best for him. It doesn't sound like it. We can't go there. -I love you. -I know. I love you too. -That's O.K., right? -Yeah, that's O.K. Is that O.K.? You like vodka, Josiah? I'm O.K. Man, you're strong. I wish I had muscles like yours. Jesus Fucking Christ! Jesus Fucking Christ what? Just Jesus Fucking Christ. You don't mind, do you? Your heart's beating real fast. Yeah, no kidding. I want to know what Max felt. And one thing I've learned, Josiah, is to never delay gratification if I can possibly avoid it. What do you want me to do? Pretend I'm Max. Do to me what you did to Max. Turn around. Would it be better if I left? Would you mind? You working at the Parrot tonight? Yeah. You know this has nothing to do with you, right? Is there anything I can do? No, no. I had a really great time today. Thank you. How does it feel to be straightened out? Fuck you. How could you leave him high and dry? You may not realize this, but Max and I saw each other... constantly for 6 months. Yeah, and then you packed up and shipped out. Max had nothing to do with that. Did you bother to let him know that? Yeah. And how do you think he took it? He seemed O.K. Yeah, well, the things Max feels the most, he doesn't say them. Not to anybody. How can I say this? Our love was irrelevant on any sustainable basis. Max pre-empted it himself in the end. You were very relevant to him. Max is heading somewhere I can't go. He has to find out where. I can't show him. You can't show him. No one can. I know that whenever I'm with Max, I feel like it's all going to be O.K., you know? Like he's the most real thing in my life. That's you! What about him? Jeez! What your brother needs now is support for what he's doing in the world. I think he gets lots of support. From Nikki? How do you know about Nikki? Same way you know about me, come on. Such a soap opera! You know, they're a lot alike, Max and Nikki. A lot alike. Maybe what you're looking for in Max, maybe what you're really looking for is Nikki. You know, only Max would think of camping... practically in the middle of fucking winter. Yeah. Max just says yes to life all the time. What? What's that for? You know how long he's been waiting for this camping trip you promised. Why are you on my case about Max? I don't know. It's been a long time since I've seen you. I guess I'm surprised you're here. You're not glad I came? Nikki, I was hoping that you'd give me a chance... to be your friend again. You were incapable of being my friend. I got on with my life. I think it's vain of you to think I'd be... into you at this point. I guess you don't beat around the bush, huh? That's your idea of a fulfilling relationship? Dating Roxanne? She makes me feel like less of a fraud, I guess. Maybe because she's such a fraud. I think you're going to have to work really hard to... make yourself appealing, and I don't think you've even begun to do it. I think I've tried. But you're also a drunk with no urge to address his own demons. I address them every day, thanks. O.K., yeah, you're functional. Usually. -Yeah, give me credit for that. -O.K. You're functional. My uncle died of cirrhosis of the liver. It wasn't pretty but he was functional. So... What kind of guy are after? I mean, if you were looking for a guy? I already told you, I'm not. If you were? Can I ask you a personal question? Have you been with Max? Have I been with him? No. Yeah, but you've thought about it, right? Look, even if l wanted to, I couldn't. Why not? He trusts you, he adores you. That's exactly why I couldn't. You don't think he desires you? No, I don't. I think he feels the same way I do about him. You don't know what you're missing. What's that mean? Well, you said it yourself. He's a hottie. I mean, he may be small but the kid shoots like a firehose. And I'm supposed to ask you how you know that? Let's just say I've had a front-row seat. No, no, more than that. Let's just say I've had my mouth around him... and he's had his mouth around me. No, no, more than that. Let's just say he's been inside of me, and I fucking love him. That is so creepy. I just don't see the difference between... you getting with him or me getting with him. There's a word for it, Harry. Incest. I mean, if you don't want to use it, I will. Don't talk to me about things you don't understand. What do you call fucking your brother? We're not fucking! We're helping each other work shit out. Man, you never had any boundaries. Boundaries are overrated. -Don't! -Why not? Is there anything I can do to make you change your mind? No. No, there isn't. Just drink up and leave. ? And she turns her way homeward, with one star awake. ? ? Like a swan in the evening moves over the lake. ? Hey, this is Roxy. Sorry, can't get to the phone right now. Please leave a... Well, just leave her a note. Tell her you went to see the sunrise over the desert. How'd I get there, on my fucking ATV? -I'll take care of mom. -Don't. Don't do it, man. Don't manipulate her. I just want you here with me. You're not even sober. What does that have to do with anything? It has everything to do with it. I just want you here with me, bro. Call me a cab. Harry? Yo. You had a shower or a swim? A swimmy. Lie down. -You O.K.? -Uh-hum. You're kind of freaking me out. How come? -Are you on drugs? -No. -I love you, man. -I love you too. I don't really feel like making out right now. Did Nikki call you? I was there, dude. You were where, dude? I was at the Purple Parrot? Where? On the balcony above the bar. "On the balcony above the bar." Sounds like a bad romance novel. Is that what we are now, Max? Why'd you have to tell her that shit, man? You're so fucking irresponsible. Didn't you even think about how weird it was going to make it for me? Oh, for what? All of like 5 minutes? The next thing you know, you're going to be back... reading poetry in each other's arms. It's not smart to fuck with her heart, man. Or my heart. I'm being out in the open. I want you. A couple of hours ago you wanted Nikki. You need to get a fucking life. I didn't, I didn't mean that totally. Yeah, whatever. She surprised me tonight. What did you expect her to do, jump up and down? That's not what I meant. You were thinking she'd leap back into my arms and say, "Harry, come back to me"? I don't know what I expected. Is there something you wanted her to tell me? Humh? Tell me about Josiah. Are you going to see him again? -Probably not. -How come? He seems like a nice enough guy. -You talked to him. -Yeah. Well, that's so embarrassing. Why? Well, it's embarrassing that I even got with the guy. I don't see what's so embarrassing about it. It's embarrassing because now someone knows. I mean, it used to be just him and me. Hey, I don't think any less of you, Max. I mean, it's like now all of a sudden it's real. Whereas before it was just a secret. We got no secrets, you and me. Except you and me. We're only the biggest secret of all. Some things have to stay private. Like you're an expert at keeping your mouth shut. Now I have to explain to both Nikki and Josiah. Oh no! Max, you're getting a reputation. It's not funny. It's like I could never bring Josiah home to mom and dad. Not that I'd ever want to bring him home. He's a great guy, but I don't want to bring anyone home. -What are you so afraid of? -Nothing. I'm not afraid of nothing. I don't like what you did. You like staying up all night? Not really. Oh man. I wish we had some rockets right now. What would the papers say if you got arrested? All the good stuff's illegal. I wish you still flew rockets. Yeah, me too. There's nowhere to fly rockets in New York probably. I'm sure there's probably somewhere. If I study physics in college, I bet you I get to fly rockets. That'd be fucking great, man. I don't want to be a scientist but I still... want to know that stuff. Well, model rockets ain't brain surgery. How'd I ever wind up singing on an album, anyway? I mean, I can't even sing. Tell that to the Wal-Mart crowd. You know, mom has big plans for you this summer. Hey... I don't like that look. I mean, I've seen that look on you several times... since I've been out here. It's all O.K. Yeah, you keep telling yourself that, but your shoulders, they say something different. It's like you get all hunchbacked or something. It can't be that bad, right? All I have to do is show up. Everything else is taken care of. It's more than just showing up and you know it. I'm worried about what's going to happen in the fall. What's going to happen in the fall? You know what I mean. If you decide not to finish school. I have to finish school. Yeah, well, suppose the summer turns out great, Max? Suppose mom can book another tour for the fall? It's like you're both avoiding the inevitable, you and her. What if I went to the science magnet next year? Point is, you're already a professional. You have the ability to make lots of money... and mom and dad both know it. And I don't believe that they don't want you... to get a good education. I just don't see how you're going to do both. I just don't see how you can be his business partner... and his mother. Everything about the way I set up the tour is to protect him. Yeah, well, there's things you can't protect him from, mom. Trust me. What's going on with you guys? Nothing. Were you drunk when he went over there last night? No. After a certain hour I can only assume that you were. And I've asked you not to see him in that state. You know what? I'm not going to play into what you're doing. What am I doing? You don't even know you're doing it! So... What's up with you? It's been a long time since we've talked. Makes me happy. Yeah, well, when you say things like... 'l asked you not to see him in that state'... You justify taking control of Max. Like, what, he needs you? I've got news for you, he does. And I haven't done a bad job, all things considered. Meaning what, I haven't done a good job? Meaning I don't want your self-destructiveness... to ever seem like a viable option to him! That's really interesting, coming from you. What the hell are you talking about? You don't know what it means to turn your life around... the way that I had to. I wanted you to, I did. But did you ever really want to know me, mom? You escaped, O.K.? How could I get the chance to get to know you? I earned the right to escape. And once I did you thought, what... that you could just hand over all your shit? Like it was going to float away on some magical fucking tour bus?! I don't have the keys to your prison, mom. And I don't want to spend any more time there. And one day Max is going to surprise the hell out of you... and he's going to figure out, hey, he can actually have the type of family he's always wanted. And you're not going to be a part of it. Give it to him yourself. It's Chiapas, '97. She kept us from getting shot about half a dozen times. I won't ask how. Beats me. It was all in Spanish. How is she anyway? She's cool. What's the deal with you and her? Like what? Like how are you going to love her now? Like I always did. You can't. It's different now. You're always assuming that everyone's fucking everyone else. It meant a lot to her for a long time. Now she thinks you need it. Need it for what? Protection, man. Be protected. You know my favorite part of Mexico, right? Why don't we go down to Baja for a while, just you and me? Yesterday it was all about finishing school. Yeah, well, that's what tutors are for. You know, you study for a year, take your SATs, next thing you know you'll wind up at Columbia U or CalTech. That's ridiculous. You've got a girlfriend waiting for you. Yeah, not anymore I don't. You ended it? We mutually ended it. -Sad. -Why? You never liked the bitch anyway. It's sad because you don't have anyone. What do you want when I get back from Japan? I want someone who's going to be there for me, O.K.? I want someone I can really love. I thought that was what I was offering? Hey Jordan. How was your flight? That doesn't sound good. I'm starving, though. Nothing kills this guy's appetite. Smells great. I remember the gallery owner said that Max was going to be there, right? I was like, oh my God, what's this turning into, an event? Everything with Max is an event. How did the show do, anyway? I sold 4 paintings. The best one was to your mom. She has good taste. And a shark's instincts, too. I was the one who told her to buy it. Liar. She chose it herself. You wouldn't have even noticed me standing there... if she hadn't come up. I've never seen the painting in question. -I've got a slide of it... -Oh yeah? Well, let's see it. As usual, the slide's a pale representation of the thing. Great ass. That was some amazing meal, pal. Thanks. You know, this is the first time I think we've got to talk... without, you know, being in the middle of some crowd. Yeah, I guess it is. How's things going with you and Max? -They're going great. -Good to hear, good to hear. How are things going with you and your girlfriend? The same. -Is that good or bad? -It's neutral. Nothing like you and Max. How so? You guys are like the perfect couple, right? You got yourself one gorgeous man here, Max. Move over. Wait a minute... do I even get a vote in this or what? Well, you know my vote. For love, forever and always. Well, I don't think it's a good idea. I mean, not that I don't think you're a great guy or anything... You know, it seems like the guys I always want... are always questioning my motives. Don't pretend you really want me, man. I fuckin' want you. I'm like in a committed relationship with your brother. And I respect that totally. Just because we all like each other... doesn't mean we have to fuck each other. Well, I want to fuck you and Max. And I'm not used to not getting what I want. Well, that's great. But the vote needs to be unanimous. You haven't even got a fucking majority, bro. I got nothing. I don't got the one guy l ever really loved, either. That's bullshit. I've always been there for you, that's the problem. I can't take care of you anymore. No one asked you to. Oh right. It was just my job. That's pretty funny. What is? I always thought it was our job to take care of each other. Hey don't get me wrong. I was happy when he met you. It was the very thing that he needed to get out of that situation. -What situation? -The home situation. I always wanted Max to be what he never got to be. A normal kid. Well, that's some kind of fantasy. Because he's not a normal kid. Same with you. Well...I've disgraced myself for the umpteenth time, so...I'm just going to let myself out. Last chance boys... That was the last time we saw Harry. For a while. I'd already done a second album which came out and sold well. Nobody seemed to care that it was all in the backup vocals. When I fired my mom as my manager, she sued me for a percentage of royalties. I settled the lawsuit but we haven't spoken since. After that I got into a good university. The work is hard. We saw my brother pretty often when he was in town. But...something was different. Maybe he'd grown up, especially after his solo album flopped. Jordan got to know him well, even sold him a painting. It was good for the both of them. Over time the public's taste in boy bands moved on. I think Harry was secretly relieved. He spent more and more time in Japan, where he always had a following. Growing up I liked what we had together. Most people wouldn't have wanted a brother like Harry. But we couldn't help but be right for each other. Look, look, look, ties! No rails, though. Yeah, they took that shit away a long time ago. That sucks elephant dicks. And it's getting cold again. Wait!
