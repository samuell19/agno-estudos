[SCOFFS] Yes, you did! You said you would come help me paint the studio this weekend. Jeanie, pizza, wine, painting... We planned this weeks ago. [GRUNTS] Volunteering at your photo studio? Don't you have minions that could do that for you? Yes, actually I do, but you are so much better than them. JEANIE: Okay, patronizing me is not getting me back into the advertising field. I am so sick of dealing with clients who don't know what they want and executives who think they know everything. [CAT MEOWING] Ow! Fritz! What happened? The cat just stabbed me with his claws. Man, her claws dug in deep. Oh, girl, you gotta get that checked out. Cats carry bacteria that can cause cellulitis which can cause sepsis and then you can get septic shock and die. [CHUCKLES] Well, you're really positive. Aren't you? Just keeping it real. My friend. [SIGHS] I'm starving. Hey, how long does Chinese takeout last for? Oh, well, that depends on how much MSG is in the food. Yeah, if there's enough, it can turn into plastic and then it will live forever. Hm. How late does Gino's deliver? Uh, girl, they're closed. Do you not remember that there was a rat crawling through the backdoor and eating all the pepperoni? Okay. Ew. Thank you. Yeah, well, doesn't matter if you're a vegan like me. AMANDA: Jeanie, please... Fine. What time do you want me there tomorrow? 9:00. Oh, I'm sorry. That is a really funny way to pronounce noon. Jeanie, 9:00. Fine, okay. Don't think that I am waiting until 10:00 to drink. Okay, really? Wine? In the morning? [THUDDING] JEANIE: Yeah, and don't buy me that box of wine stuff. That stuff is so rough. I'm gonna need you to splurge. Spend at least six, seven dollars on a nice bottle. Amanda? Hang on. [INTENSE MUSIC] Amanda? Amanda? Earth to Amanda, hello? Yeah. Sorry, I thought I heard someone. Hang on. Amanda? [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hey, Fritzy. Jeanie, I think it was just the cat. [SCREAMING] Amanda! No! JEANIE: Amanda! Oh, my God... What is going on? Amanda, talk to me. [WHIMPERING] Jeanie! Help! Amanda, what is going on? Amanda? No! Jeanie! Amanda! [GRUNTING] G-get off! [MAN GROANS] [GROANING] No! Get off of me! [GRUNTING] Get off me! [BOTH GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [CAMERA CLICKS] [PANTING] [DOORKNOB RATTLING] Please leave me alone! Go away! Leave me alone! Go away! [SOBBING] [INTENSE MUSIC] No! [SOBBING] Thank God. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Come on. We got you. We got you. We got you. You're okay. You're okay. It's okay. He's not here. He's not here. You're safe. You're safe. We got you. [AMANDA SOBBING] It's okay. [SIREN WAILING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You are not keeping me from seeing my friend. Excuse me! Amanda! Amanda? Oh... Amanda, where are you? Oh. Amanda, Amanda! Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Are you okay? I'm okay, I'm okay. My gosh, are you hurt? What do you need? My God! I called 9-1-1 as soon as the phone went dead. I'm just so glad that you're okay. Hey, it's just bruises. I'm gonna survive. Thank you for calling. I don't know what would've happened. You still look really cute. Excuse me. Excuse me. [CHUCKLING] Yeah. Hey. Hi. Feel any better? Uh... I'm okay. I'm, uh, I'm so sorry to have to do this, but would it be all right if I asked you a few questions? Yeah, it's okay. I understand. Okay, thank you. Okay, let's just take your time, breathe, start at the beginning, okay? AMANDA: Okay. When was the very first moment that you realized something was wrong? Well, I was on the phone with Jeanie and I heard a noise, so I went looking, and out of nowhere, this man was attacking me. Do you recognize him at all? Did you get a look at his face? No, he was wearing a mask. I mean, I, I tried to take it off of him, but he was too strong, I... He clearly didn't want me to see his face. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Did he resemble anyone you know, physically? I don't know, I mean, the only thing I can remember specifically was that he was wearing all black. Dawson, what are you doing? You know perfectly well that it's department policy that only a female officer can interview a woman. Detective, I'm well aware of the policy. Just trying to get a statement. VALENCIA: I've got this. Very sorry, Ms. Reynolds. It's Amanda. Listen, you're safe now. Okay? You're in good hands. Well, that explains your department policy. Exactly. What do you mean? Oh... Come on. AMANDA: What? Amanda. Hi. I'm Detective Valencia. Well, there have been a series of home invasions in Los Feliz this summer. Unfortunately, not everyone has been as lucky as you. Lucky? Wait, wait. This guy attacked someone else? Actually, there have been six home invasions in the last two months within a one-mile radius of your address. Six? AMANDA: What? Okay, that hasn't been on the news. Oh, my God, I've been living with a complete false sense of safety. AMANDA: I know. Amanda. You might wanna stay with someone else for the next couple of days. Let's talk more once you have gathered yourself. You okay? Okay, you're staying with me. I'm packing you a bag. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] No! [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [CAMERA CLICKS] [GASPS] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SIGHS] [LINE RINGING] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Detective Valencia. Hi, Detective Valencia. It's Amanda Reynolds. I hope I'm not calling you too early. No. What can I do for you, Amanda? Uh, I was wondering if you have an update for me. No, nothin' yet. Okay. Well, do you know when it's safe for me to go home? VALENCIA: Well, you can go home anytime you want, but you have to be especially vigilant. Do you own a gun? A gun? Um, no. I've never even fired a gun before. Well, you better learn, Amanda. A gun is a great equalizer. So if you hear the intruder come in again, I want you to sit in your bed with a gun in one hand and 9-1-1 in the other. When he comes through the door, shoot the bastard. Oh. I can do that? Off the record, you can shoot anyone if they break into your home. Do you know why I joined the force? No. Why? I joined the force to protect women just like you. Unfortunately, there's so much crime out there that I can't even protect myself. And, and the department does not have the resources to cover the entire area that they need to. Wow. Well, thank you for the tips, detective, and for being honest. I appreciate it. VALENCIA: Listen, I am spending every waking hour looking for this guy. And I promise that the moment that I find him, I'll let you know. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Be safe, Amanda. [SIGHS] JEANIE: What's going on? That was Detective Valencia. I'm really freaked out, Jeanie. She opened my eyes to so many things. Okay. Like, what? You're scaring me a little bit. I don't wanna be afraid in my own home anymore. I wanna do something about it. Okay. Like, what? [CHUCKLING] I have an idea. Oh, my goodness. Come on. There's somewhere I want us to go. Okay. Okay. I can only imagine what this is. Can I get wine? No. Coffee, yes. Coffee at least? Okay. Really keeping me up. [CHUCKLES] [GUNSHOT] Good job, but you don't need to be so heavy with the trigger finger, okay? Okay. [SIGHS] [GUNSHOT] This one's a hair trigger. Just squeeze it gently. Let the gun do the work. Just relax and do it. [INTENSE MUSIC] [GUNSHOTS] That's it. Now you've got it. Have you ever done this before? No. Well, you hit the guy right between the eyes. So what do you think, you wanna buy a gun? No, I don't want to, but I don't feel safe in my home after what happened. Uh, for the record, I don't feel that safe anymore either. Look, all the criminals have them, so you may as well have one, too. That one. And bullets. MAN: Right. No point in having a gun if you can't fire it. I'm gonna go up front and start your paperwork. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SHUTS] [SHUTTER WHIRRING] That's weird. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CAR ALARM BEEPING] What? [GRUNTS] Oh, my God. What? I got no reception. Great. Dammit! Where's my gun? Ugh! [COUGHING] Help! Come on! Help me! Help! [COUGHING] Help! Uh... Help! Help! Help me! [COUGHING] Amanda. [GASPS] Oh... My God! Liam, you scared me. I'm-I'm sorry. Are you okay? Jeanie told me about what happened. Yeah, let's just get inside. I don't wanna be out here. You're really on edge. [SCOFFS] Yeah, you would be, too, if you got attacked in your own home. Come on. Oh, y-you're right. I'm sorry. You don't... need to be here. You don't think it's a bit early for you to come back into work? Well, where do you want me to go, Liam? He knows where I live. I don't feel safe. Besides, we have so much work to do with this Carlson campaign. You just look exhausted. [SIGHS] I am... How are you supposed to get work done if you're like... I don't know, we could go back to my place. [SCOFFS] Really? It's easy for you to say. You can defend yourself. You're a man. What if a guy as big as you attacked me? Or bigger? How would I do anything? I, I get it. I understand. You don't understand. That's the thing, no man really understands what it's like to be a woman. No man can really understand what a woman goes through. You're right. I mean... Do you know what it's like to walk to your car at night scared? Um, no. I-I don't. I actually never thought about that. Of course, you don't. Look, let's just focus on the Carlson campaign and, hopefully, he won't come back for me. Look, I'm sorry, all right, that this happened to you. And if I could, I would beat the guy into a pulp. Yeah. Well, I can't do that. So, hopefully, the police catch him. You're safe now. Let's get to work. Uh, yeah, the Carlson job. So, um... [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [GASPING] Are we expecting any clients? No, it's probably a solicitor. I'll get rid of him. DAWSON: Hi, I'm Detective Dawson, here to see Amanda. She just went in. Uh, yeah. Come in. Thank you. Hey, there's a, uh, Detective Dawson here to see you. Hello, Amanda. How are you? Hey. I'm okay. Been better. Welcome. Well, thank you. This is, uh... Well, it's quite a place. LIAM: Thanks. So what's going on? Yeah, I'm not gonna waste too much of your time here, but, um, I needed to give you an update. Did you find a lead? I-I'm sorry to say it's not good news. It's my partner, Detective Valencia. AMANDA: Yeah. She was found dead this morning. What? Wait, okay. No, that's impossible. I just talked to her. DAWSON: Yes, we know. You're actually the last person she spoke to on the phone. What did you two talk about? I mean, we talked about the case. What else would I talk to a detective about? Are-are you sure it was, uh, suicide? Yeah. Well, she covered the exhaust on her car, turned it on and closed the garage door. So... At least it wasn't painful, right? I'm-I'm just saying, if you're gonna commit suicide, I think that's the least painful way to do it. I... The carbon monoxide creates this, uh, euphoria... AMANDA: Liam... LIAM: Ahem. Sorry. Yeah. No, that's, that's not true at all. It's an excruciating way to go. But unfortunately, my partner had some, uh, issues that she didn't properly resolve, so... AMANDA: Oh, that's terrible. LIAM: Right, I'm-I'm sorry about your partner, but is, is that why you came, to tell Amanda about your partner? That's... that's kind of weird. No. No, it's not. Um, Amanda, I, uh, actually had a chance to speak to the Captain and she agreed to post an officer in front of your house 24 hours, so you're safe to go home anytime. Yes, that is such a relief. Thank you. LIAM: Get some sleep, right? Yeah. We've been, uh, working on this campaign that we're trying to finish, so that's, that's good. Oh, great. Are you two in a relationship? No. Uh, yeah. Wha... What are you... No! [CHUCKLES] Uh, Liam... No. Um... Uh, we used to date and now we're just friends and business partners. LIAM: Yeah. Okay. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Just gathering information. Okay. Well, um, I'll leave you two to your work. But, uh, if anything comes up, give me a call, please. I will. Okay. Hey. Hey, detective. Will you be the one watching my house? Yes, I'll actually be taking the night shift. Okay. [DOOR OPENS] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Is that Dawson? Yeah, that's him. I think he likes you. What? No. Wait, really? Oh, my God. Whatever, Amanda. [CHUCKLES] He's kinda sexy in that tough-as-nails kind of way. Probably an animal in the bedroom. Oh, my gosh. Jeanie! [LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] AMANDA: I can't believe you just said that. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GROANING] Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing back here? I live here, man. What? I live here! Who the hell are you? I'm a police officer. Why are you sneaking around the back of this house? I forgot my key, I-I was gonna climb through the doggy door. Show me your ID. Slowly. 1702 Willow Lane. I'm very sorry, sir. I, uh, thought you're the man who attacked your neighbor. Amanda? Why'd I attack Amanda? What're you talking about? There was a home invasion last night. There was an intruder, she fought him off. I would have had no way of knowing that. I was with my girlfriend for the last three days. At her house. I'm, I'm very sorry. I, I hope you can understand. [SIGHS] Sure. It's all right. Yeah. I mean, you're just doing your job, I guess. I just, I-I really wanna get this guy. You know what I mean? Obviously. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Ah, coffee. Hang on, Fritzy, I'll feed you in a second. Ugh... Ugh. Come on. There's gotta be more. [GASPS] [CHUCKLING] Hi. [CHUCKLES] Ah, you scared me. I am so sorry. It's okay. I-I made a little coffee run, I just thought you could use some. Well, you thought right. Come on in. Gosh, you must be exhausted. [CLEARS THROAT] Shouldn't you go home and get some sleep? Nah. I'll get it in, don't worry. I wanted to check in on you first. Did you get any sleep? Mm, kinda hard to when you're sleeping with one eye open, you know? Yeah, of course. Listen, Amanda, I, I know this is a lot to process right now, but just so you know, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. We're gonna get this guy. You have my word. Well, thank you. All right, why don't you finish getting ready? I'll make sure you get to work. Oh. You don't have to do that. No, no. It's fine. Uh, it's on my way home, anyway. Uh! Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I'll be right back. Hey, detective? Yeah. Why are you so determined to find this guy? I mean, of all the cases you could be investigating, why are you so focused on this one? It's personal. Personal? [DAWSON CHUCKLES] So, um, yeah, my, my dad left when I was 12. My mom and I were alone. And, uh, um, one night, a, uh, a stalker broke in... and attacked her. Wow, and you stopped him? No. No. I-I just sat in the closet. I-I couldn't move. I was paralyzed. I heard everything, though. So, uh, since then I-I've made a point to take down the men who attack women. How'd your mom get away? Uh, she... I mean, she tried. She-she went for a gun, but, um... Uh, yeah. You-you don't have to talk about it. I'm sorry. No, it's-it's fine, really. But, uh... Well, I-I hope that explains things a little better. Yeah, it does. Of course, it makes total sense. All right. Grab your stuff. I'll get you to work. Okay. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [SNIFFLES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Okay. You ready? Yeah, let's do it. Okay. I forgot. The intruder broke my lock. Oh, well, it's okay, I mean, as long as there's a cop out there, nobody's coming in here. You sure it's okay to leave it? Yeah, absolutely. But for your peace of mind, I'll make sure to get that fixed. Oh. You will? Well, yeah. You gotta feel safe, right? Oh, I wish every cop was like you. [CHUCKLING] [AMANDA LAUGHING] AMANDA: Oh, there's no way that's true. DAWSON: Listen, I'm telling you, I was like a total computer geek in high school. [LAUGHING] Yeah, maybe a jock's version of a computer geek. Well, nothing to worry about here. Cool. You have my number. Yes, but I won't be using it. You need to get some rest. Hey, protecting you and making sure we catch this guy is a lot more important than my sleep. AMANDA: O-okay. Mm-hmm. You guys are spending a lot of time together. Is that what detectives do? What's that supposed to mean? I just feel like, at this point, it's not about protecting you, it's about him having his way with you. Will you stop doing that? Stop what? All right. Guilty. All right, I'm a little bit jealous. But what's wrong with that? I'm not your girlfriend. No. Here, I got you your favorite coffee or mocha, whatever it is. Thank you. Um... You're welcome. James actually got me one... James? James. Was that his first name? Yes. Oh, come on, you're crossing the line. This is ridiculous. How long am I supposed to call him detective for? I don't know, maybe once he has his way with you, it'll all be good. Okay, if you talk about him having his way with me one more time, I'm gonna file a complaint. With who? HR. Yeah. [CHUCKLING] Okay, what are you doing with all of this stuff out, anyways? Getting ready. For what? We got it. The Carlson job. What? Oh, my God, Liam! I'm... Uh... How have you not told me? I'm telling you now. She sent me an e-mail this morning. So, anyway, she loved your idea about the film shoot and she says it's cool and retro and not ridiculous and expensive like I said. Ha, I told you! Oh, this is so big! Liam, this is our biggest job yet. I know. She wants mock-ups by Monday. Oh! Okay, um... We have a lot to do. Let's get to work. Maybe you could ask your friend James. Maybe he's still in the parking lot waiting for you. Ha-ha-ha! Very funny. It's funny. That's a weird way to act for a guy who's trying to get back with his ex. What'd you say? Hm? Nothing. Hey, do we still have that shoot that we did last month that I loved? Uh, it's on the desk. Did you have workers coming to your house today? AMANDA: No. Um, hold on. Let me look. Just stay here. Hello. Make sure everything's working properly, all right? Detective, hi. Hey. Long day at the office, huh? AMANDA: Yeah. All right, thanks, Frank. It's good. So what are you doing here? Oh. I-I told you I was gonna take care of the locks, and Frank owed me a favor, so... I hope it's okay. Oh, yeah, of course. I just didn't expect it. Thank you. Okay, I also installed an alarm system. If any doors and windows open in the whole house... What? [ALARM BEEPS] Alarm goes off. And police will be dispatched within 60 seconds. This must've cost you a fortune. Like I said, Frank owed me, okay? No one is gonna be getting in this house without you knowing about it. Okay. Listen, um, if you're not comfortable, I mean, I, I'd be glad to uninstall it. No, no, no. It's great. I'm just, um... Yeah, no. I love it. Thank you. Um, here you go. You're safe now, okay? All this stuff, a cop outside your door, you have nothing to worry about. Okay? Thank you again, detective, for all of this. I mean... Of course. Don't mention it. All right, now get a good night's rest and please call me if you need anything. Yes, I will. Thank you, detective. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, Amanda... Yeah, a guy was just in your house and you didn't do anything about it. You don't think that's weird? He's a cop. What, he can't have access to my house? Did you give him access to your house? Yeah, sort of. "Sort of?" Liam, this is not a big deal. I got new locks and an alarm system. That's amazing. It's amazing a cop breaks into your house and he installs an alarm system of his choice, on his own dime. He didn't break into my house. The door is unlocked. And he said that Frank guy or whatever owed him a favor. I think it was really sweet. He must care about me. Maybe a little too much. Liam, you gotta stop doing that. Doing what? Come on. All right. I'm gonna go to bed. I'll see you tomorrow at the studio? All right. Okay. Goodnight. Sleep well. Yeah, you, too. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INTENSE MUSIC] [CAR HONKS] DAWSON: Reese! What the hell do you want? Come on. Get over here. You know what I want. I dunno what you talking about. Reese, shh. Don't play stupid with me tonight. I'm not in the mood. I said, I don't know what you're talking about. You broke into two houses in Los Feliz. Did you not? What? Is this not you? Come on, man. That ain't me. I don't know what you're up to, man. Okay? But it's gonna stop, and it's gonna stop now. You think you're gonna arrest me with some blurry picture? You and I both know I'll be out of jail before midnight. [REESE CHUCKLES] Nah, you're right. [CLICKS TONGUE] You're right. You're right. You know I'm right. Yeah. No, I'm not gonna arrest you. Good. I'm, uh... I'm just gonna play judge and jury right here. What the hell is your problem? Mr. Foreman, have you reached a verdict? Oh, yes, Your Honor. Yes, we have reached a verdict. Who the hell are you talking to? How do you find the defendant? We find the defendant guilty. No, no, no, no, no, no, no... Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. No, no. [GROANING] DAWSON: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Dawson, you're completely insane. Oh, come on, buddy, we're just having a little fun. You've the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney one'll be provided to you by the court. Understand these rights as they've been read to you? You-you know you can't make this stick. Let's go. REESE: Come on. AMANDA: So we got that Carlson campaign. We just don't know where we're gonna shoot it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blah, blah, blah. Okay, tell me everything. What is it like working with your ex-boyfriend and falling in love with the detective on your case? Come on, do you think of anything other than my love life? Um, I try not to. Mine's pretty depressing. Okay. Liam is my partner. Mm-hmm? Hm... Business partner. And Detective Dawson is just working my case. Oh, it sounds very sexy when you say it like that. Okay. "Working my case?" You are demented. Okay, but you don't think it's a little weird that he broke into your house to install a security system? I mean, these things are expensive. I know because I had to get one for my homeowner's insurance. Comes with a camera and a security system. And now I sound like I'm doing a commercial for an insurance company. No, he's just trying to keep me safe. He didn't break into my house. Plus, the guy who attacked me is still out there. So... I don't know. No, I know. I'm sorry. It just feels like a lot of personal attention. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Yeah. Hang on. Ooh! Who is it? Hi, Detective Dawson. What? Uh, no. Yeah. [SIGHS] Are you sure? Okay. No. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Okay. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Hey, what's going in? The guy who attacked me, they got him. He's in jail. My hands are shaking. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Ugh. I don't know what we're gonna do. We'll figure it out. We have to have the party this weekend, and every venue is booked already. Not to mention our Internet is from 1999. I don't think we need to have a party. I think with everything going on, what we need to focus on is the presentation. Wait. LIAM: I'm waiting. [CHUCKLES] What? Here. We should have the party here. Here? Yes, the studio is a perfect place for a party. And we can show off what we do. We do not need to show off what we do. Yes, we do. We can't afford to lose the Carlson campaign. And this will help reinforce the relationship. LIAM: I do not agree. Well, too bad. The decision's been made. Oh, and I have no say? Nope. Typical. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Oh, Jeanie, thank you so much for coming. I know. I'm glad you called. Who are all these people? Lot of friends, family. Oh, there's the Carlson team right there. Oh. Hi! Great party. Good. Thank you. Have fun. I will. And, um, a few other people are coming. Oh. Well, that explains why you look so fabulous. Well, he helped me out a lot with my case. It's the least I could do. Yeah. Right. See you. AMANDA: Hey, you made it! This is beautiful! Thank you. Well done. Yeah. I hope I'm not too late. No! No, you're right on time. Oh. Congratulations. Oh! Thank you. You did not have to do that. Oh, come on. We're celebrating, right? AMANDA: Ooh-hoo! Davrow Creek? You definitely didn't have to do that. Detective, uh, so glad you can come out, see what people actually do for a living. I'm sorry, Liam. I'm not entirely sure what that means. It's your job. I mean, to protect and serve. So it's a party. You see all the people you're serving. Right? DAWSON: That's interesting. You-you think it's my job to serve you, Liam? Well, don't you cops, like, take an oath or something? Okay. You've had a little too much to drink. Go entertain some of the other guests. Okay? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Drunk and jealous are a bad combination. What is he, uh, jealous of? Well, he's jealous of the way I look at you. And how do you look at me? [AMANDA CHUCKLES] I look at you like someone I'd like to get to know better. Do you have a second to go talk? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go. It-it won't take long. Okay. It'll-it'll just take a second. All right. Yeah, that's great. Come on, I'll show you. Hi. Why don't we just go in here? Yeah, it's perfect. Okay. So what's going on? I won't keep you from your party too long, but I just... [SIGHS] I just wanted to let you know that I, I think you're amazing, Amanda. I-I've just never met anyone like you before, and I just, I wanna know everything about you and I, I can't wait to... get to know you better. Well, I feel the same way. I don't know what I would've done that night. If you hadn't shown up, I... You saved my life. Well, gotta get back to work. Okay. Okay. I'll see you out there. All right. So, Amanda, with about four hours until her final project is due, she runs out and she takes like a hundred random pictures of these people on the quad. She comes back and she kicks this poor girl out of the dark room. And then she gets the photos edited in time, sure enough, and gets her project in time. Sounds like me. Yes. Uh-huh. What did you call it? Oh, gosh. Uh, "A Study In Moods," I think. [ALL LAUGHING] LIAM: Great! AMANDA: I got a B. Uh-huh. Whereas, my project, I poured my heart and soul into it and I got a C plus. That's when I changed to marketing with you. Oh, oh, my gosh. So... Well, we can't wait to see what you do with our campaign. I mean, we saw 12 of the exact same proposal by 12 different people until we came across yours. I mean, we fell in love with it. It was just so unique. AMANDA: Hm. LIAM: Thank you. Good to hear. Thank you. That's why Amanda's a genius. AMANDA: Mm. LIAM: What about me? Oh, my gosh! [INDISTINCT] What? The truth comes out. [LAUGHING] LIAM: Yeah. Can I get you something to drink? CARLSON: I'd love something. Uh, Sangria? Sure. Uh, double the brandy. No strawberries. I'm crazy allergic to strawberries. Got it. You guys good? Good. LIAM: Good. Thanks, Jeanie. JEANIE: Yup. You're awfully quiet tonight. I got nothing to add. Sometimes less is more. LIAM: Oh, tell them about the photo shoot you did with the guinea pigs. It's funny. Well, thank you. This woman is heartbroken. So... Mr. Bubble story. JEANIE: Oh, gosh. So Liam and I go out. We search everywhere. We can't find him. No strawberries, right? Oh, berry-free, guaranteed. Okay. I-I'm sorry. Go ahead. AMANDA: So I go back to my apartment and, sure enough, Mr. Bubbles is taking a nap at the bottom of my camera bag. We take him home, and, sure enough, she has got the entire neighborhood with flashlights, out searching. I mean, it was so ridiculous. [LAUGHING] LIAM: She is a weird guinea-pig lady. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I mean, it was ridicu... [CARLSON BREATHING HEAVILY] Hey, are you okay? [GROANING] Are you... Oh, my God! Is she all right? Jeanie, are you sure there was no strawberries? Why, of course! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, my... DAWSON: Having a reaction... AMANDA: Jeanie, call 9-1-1! Okay, we got you. We got you. We got you... Liam. Hey, Liam, look at me. In my car, passenger seat, underneath. First-aid kit with an epinephrine pen. Go. Now. Hurry. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROANING] This party was supposed to impress the Carlson team. Instead, we almost killed her. And Carlson literally told her about the strawberries, like, five times. How did Jeanie screw it up? I know. The thing that annoys me is why didn't she just own up to it and apologize. Instead, she just ran out here. Did she text you? No, I don't wanna talk to her. We should totally throw this away. This place is absolutely trash. What do you wanna do? I don't know. Let's just clean up. I think it'll make me feel better. You wanna start here? Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much for meeting with me, detective. I'm... Captain, sorry. I'm sure you're incredibly busy. I just, I didn't... No, let's, let's just jump to the point, shall we? Save ourselves both some time. Okay. What's up? I think one of your detectives is abusing their power. That's a serious allegation. I know. And I wouldn't make it lightly. Well, does this detective have a name? James Dawson. And what exactly has James Dawson done? He's been investigating my friend Amanda Reynolds' case. Well, that case is closed. Yes. And he has been hanging around a lot. And that means... Well, it means... Last night, um, he was at her party. Well, was he invited? Well, yes. But I mean... I think it's a little odd that he's been hanging around so much after the case has been solved. [LAUGHS] Well, Detective Dawson is an adult. I mean, he's allowed to make new friends. Yes, but, uh... [SIGHS] Look. I'm sorry... Last night, I think that he tried to hurt someone, okay? She's allergic to strawberries, and I think he intentionally put them in her drink, and she wound up at the hospital. Um, wait, are you saying that Detective Dawson actually tried to cause an allergic reaction to somebody? Do you have proof? Did you see him do it? No, I... Listen. I was standing right there. And I walked away for two... [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yeah? Yes. Yes. Okay, I'll be right there. All right. Look. I appreciate your concerns, but the reality is... Please, you have to believe me. Detective Dawson is one of my best men. And the reality is, if you've got a problem, you need to file a report. So you're just gonna ignore me? I'm not ignoring you. There's a protocol. You should file a report if you have a problem. One of my guys out here will be happy to take that for you. You have a rogue detective. You have a responsibility to get him out of the streets. [LAUGHS] You've been watching way too much television. That's just not how it works. All the detectives, they will always have the benefit of the doubt. And right now the only thing that I'm doubting is you. So you have a choice. You can either leave or you can file a report. But I have to go. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [CHUCKLING] [SIGHS] [MOANS] Oh, I'm sorry. [LAUGHS] What? It's crazy, I don't even know you. Oh, come on. Sure, you do. Hm. I'm the one who saved your life. Oh! So because you saved my life, you get to have your way with me, huh? Have my way with you? What are we, teenagers? [LAUGHS] Oh, no, I don't know. It just... After everything, I just, I want to go slow. Oh. Yeah. No, of course. I'm, I'm sorry. You don't mind, do you? No. No, no, no. Of course not. Okay. No, you, uh... No, you're definitely worth waiting for. Good. Okay, so tell me about yourself. I wanna know everything. Where were you born? Well, I was born in Chicago, um, but my parents moved to Kansas City when I was like, like, three I think. Kansas City? Okay. Yeah, I don't recommend it. Um, and we were there for another... [INTENSE MUSIC] [GASPS] Oh, my gosh! [LAUGHS] You scared me. Why would you do that to me? What's goin' on? Hey, why are you dressed like that? Hey! Hey! Hey! Help! Hey! Help! Help! Help! Help! Aah! Aah! Help! Hey, stop! Help! Help! Help! Ah! Help me! Help me! Help! [JEANIE SCREAMS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] So I'll see you tonight. All right? All right. Sounds good. Amanda! Ah, there you are, I tried calling you, like, ten times last night. Okay. Well, my ringer was off. Of course, it was. Obviously, you were busy. AMANDA: Yeah. Liam, obviously, I was. What's so important? What? You didn't hear the news? About Jeanie? No. What about Jeanie? Amanda, Jeanie was killed last night. What? While Detective Dawson here was getting to know you better, he wasn't doin' his job. Instead, Jeanie got killed by an intruder. Wait, I thought you arrested him. I did. Well, apparently, he got out on bail yesterday. Oh, my God. What? Why would they do that? LIAM: Hm. I don't know. Maybe because you're a terrible detective. No. Oh, my God, he's right. Okay, I gotta go. I'm, I'm so sorry. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna call her mom. [SOBBING] Oh, my God. LIAM: Hey. You need anything else? No. I'm fine, thank you. This'll hopefully make you feel a little bit better. [SIGHS] One of us should get to the studio. Carlson, I'm sure, needs... Amanda, I'm not going anywhere. She'll understand. We can't lose this campaign. No... Amanda. Look at me. I'm not going anywhere. I can't stop thinking about her face... looking at me through the door. [SIGHS] I just should've said something. [SNIFFLES] I should've answered her call. Maybe I could've... No, you can't. You can't do that. This is not your fault. All right. One person did this. All right? Just one. I'm not gonna be able to rest until that bastard's dead. [SOBBING] [INTENSE MUSIC] Hey, Reese! [SIGHS] What is your issue with me? How did you get bail so quickly? I told you you didn't have enough proof. Hm. So... the judge let me go. Try again. What? Who takes care of you? Who looks out for you? What, you think I'm gonna let my boy sit in jail? Come on. Look, man, you know I've gotta make arrests, all right? I got quotas to fill. I got a Captain on my ass. Right? Come on. I got you. You're the man. I got you. You got... But you know what? I am sorry. REESE: Really? All right? I know it's, it's-it's inconvenient. I get it. So I got you a little something. What? Yeah. Come here. Yeah, go ahead. Feel it up. What is this? Well, it's unregistered. It's unmarked and it's untraceable. And it's yours. It's just my way of saying thank you. Go ahead, open it up. Feel it up. Go ahead. [LAUGHS] It's nice, right? You feel that weight? That's nice. Daddy like. Yeah. Daddy like! Yes, sir. Police! Drop your weapon! Dawson! Come on, man! Drop your weapon now! No, no! No! Dude, don't! [GUNSHOT] [BREATHING HEAVILY] DAWSON: Yes, Detective Dawson. I need backup right away. The 8th and Alameda. Shots fired, suspect down. I repeat, shots fired, suspect down. Backup, now. [BREATHING HEAVILY] You see, Reese... when people like you... come across a real predator... you don't survive. You should've known your place. And you should have known when to stop. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hey. What's going on? Reese is dead. What? Are you sure? Yeah. I had to kill him myself. I went to check up on him and he pulled a gun on me. I had no choice. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, he didn't get a shot off. I'm fine. Oh, thank God you're okay. I wanted to come and tell you myself. I... I just... I knew you wouldn't be able to sleep until that bastard was dead. You know, we should go over the details of the case as soon as possible, so... I mean, is, is now an okay time? Uh... Yeah, actually, are you available tomorrow? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Okay. Thank you, detective. Wow. I mean, you've got to be relieved, right? Amanda? Did you hear what he said? Yeah, he just said Reese is dead. No. He said he knew I wouldn't be able to rest until that bastard was dead. Uh, um, so? Liam, that's exactly what I said to you earlier. LIAM: Wait, I'm confused. So how did he know I said that? It was a coincidence, right? Coincidence? Really, a word-for-word coincidence? I don't think so. Whoa, well, what do you think? Dawson came in here, bugged your house? Amanda? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Amanda? Captain Marcus. Thank you for meeting me here. I just didn't feel safe at the station. Oh, no, no, no, I understand. [CHUCKLES] You must be on the edge with everything that's happened to you this week. How can I help you? It's about Detective Dawson. I don't know exactly, he just... I think he's been watching me. He installed a security system in my house after the break-in and... I found a camera. Well, what makes you think that he's been watching you? Just things he said, it's like things I said when I know he wasn't around. Well, sometimes, after a traumatic experience such as this, people tend to get focused on other individuals that are involved. It's perfectly understandable. Okay. So you're saying he's become focused on me? Well, not him. It's you. [SCOFFS] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Well, Dawson approached me about his concerns, uh, when your friend Jeanie came to visit me. [GASPS] My friend Jeanie came to see you? About Dawson? Yes. But when I asked Dawson about this, he said that he was afraid that you were getting too attached to him, that you were expecting so much from him, like, escorting you from place to place... That was his idea! And that you were calling him up at all hours of the night. Because he told me to. Look, he's willing to drop this whole matter if you just stop pursuing him. Captain, I never pursued him. What are you saying? We're both women. Are you really gonna stand in front of me and tell me you don't believe me? I do believe you, it's just that I need more evidence. How much more do you need? My best friend is dead. And I just told you that this man put cameras inside my house. I have evidence. Your evidence is purely circumstantial. I need more. Imagine it from my perspective. Your life's not in danger. I couldn't possibly see it from your perspective. Thank you for your time, Captain. [ENGINE REVVING] How'd your meeting go with Diane? Get off my property. Hold on. Hold on. I get that you're upset. Okay, I... I think we've both done some things here that we regret. [CHUCKLES] Right? But, look. Hey. I think we got something special here. And if you are willing to look past this, then so am I. Everything okay? The only thing that I regret is meeting you. [CHUCKLES] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ENGINE REVVING] LIAM: You about ready? Yeah, just a few more minutes. It's okay. I'll wait. No, we can't both be late. Well, Amanda, I'm not gonna leave you here alone. Liam, I'm fine. I'll be right behind you. Amanda, come on. What? Look, we can't screw this up, okay? Just go get setup for the shoot. I don't care about the shoot. I care about you. Oh. Come here. [CHUCKLES] Amanda, this last week has made me realize I have absolutely no idea what I would do without you. Well, you'd probably get a new business partner. I don't want another business partner, I want you. Hm. Liam... I-I know my timing's horrible. Okay, but I've been waiting a really long time to let you know how I feel. You know, Liam, I've been waiting a long time for it to feel right again. LIAM: Oh, I missed you so much. [LIAM CHUCKLES] Okay. Let's go get to work. Just one more kiss. No. I'm not gonna let men control me anymore. Not even me? Especially you. Go get set up, I'll meet you there. [LIAM GROANING] All right. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Who is that? Hello, Liam. What are you doing here? I came to ask you a few questions. That's funny because I actually wanted to ask you a couple of questions. [LAUGHS] Well, that's interesting. It's not really how this works. I don't care. Okay, honestly, what is your problem with us? What's my problem? Why are you breaking into homes and attacking women, Liam? [CHUCKLES] Wow. That is funny, detective. Is that how you solve all your cases? You accuse innocent people? Or maybe... Hm. LIAM: Maybe you're jealous of what Amanda and I have. [CHUCKLES] Why in the world would I be jealous of you? I'm sure you heard we're a couple again... because you've literally been listening to every single thing we've been saying! What, you put cameras in her house? What is wrong with you? You don't know what you're talking about. Sure I do. [PANTING] You were dumb enough to repeat words verbatim that she said. Bravo, detective. So what, you thought you were gonna come in here and, what, set Amanda and I up? You wanna know why you're not gonna get away with that? You're too stupid. You're taking it too far. Relax, okay? What the hell did you think was gonna happen, man? Nobody talks to me like that! Relax, okay? I'm sorry. I went too far. Put the gun down. Please. You... Dude, come on, look at me. You don't... You don't wanna shoot me. No, you're right. I'm not gonna shoot you. Amanda's gonna shoot you. "Oh, uh..." This is her gun, dummy. [PANTING] Yeah, I think nobody's gonna believe that, buddy, come on. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [CHUCKLES] Maybe. That's not really your concern at this point, is it? Please... [INTENSE MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] [LIAM GROANING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] And I want to personally thank you for giving us a second chance. I think you're really gonna like what we have. I can't... CARLSON: Hopefully, Liam is all set up. [LIAM BREATHING HEAVILY] No! Liam! CARLSON: Oh, my! [AMANDA SOBBING] Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Is he okay? Please get help now. I will! I will! Oh, my God. It's okay, it's okay. Calm down, you're gonna be all right. LIAM: Yeah. [BREATHING HEAVILY] WOMAN: [ON PA] Dr. York, please call the third floor pharmacy. Dr. York, please call the third floor pharmacy. Amanda Reynolds? Yeah? I-I didn't mean to scare you. No, it's okay, you didn't. Um, I'm just... How's Liam? Well, it was an in-and-out. So thankfully there was no damage to the organs. The surgery will tell us more as to the extent of the bullet's damage. Oh, my God. Has his family been notified? No, I haven't been able to reach them yet. Well, keep trying and we'll let you know if anything changes. Okay. Thanks. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] WOMAN: [ON PA] Visiting hours are ending... Visiting hours are ending... [ENGINE REVVING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Hi. [SIGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Oh, my God. MARCUS: Oh, Dawson. Captain. How's that paperwork coming on the Pine case? I'm just finishing up. It was supposed to be on my desk this morning. I know. It'll be there tonight, all right? MARCUS: Make sure that it is. And, Dawson, do me a favor. Make sure that it's legible, too. I'll do my best. Damn it! [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Hm. Hey. Liam, I got the proof. Amanda, slow down. I found photos on his computer. Photos of me and other women and Valencia. I even found a picture of him the night that he attacked me. Wait, wait, Amanda, Amanda, what are you talking about? AMANDA: This isn't his first time, Liam. I think that he killed Jeanie and Detective Valencia and God knows who else. A-Amanda, you need to go to the police. [GRUNTING] To who? Captain Marcus? No way. I need to get this to someone who can do something about it. I'm heading to the office right now and I'm gonna send this out to every reporter in the city. Amanda, please be careful, okay? This guy is dangerous. If he finds out about this, he's gonna come... If he finds out, it's gonna be too late. [SIGHS] A-Amanda, come on. WOMAN: [ON PA] Dr. Wayne, please report to the ER. Dr. Wayne, please report to the ER. [TIRES SCREECHING] [PANTING] Okay. Okay. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] Oh, come on. Come on. Upload. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] Why would you do this? [GASPING] Why? This could've been so easy, Amanda. Now, why did you have to make it so hard? Huh? You know, all I wanted was to take care of you. I mean, is that... really so terrible? You think I'm an idiot? You think I wouldn't know you broke into my office? That I wouldn't find you? Actually, I was counting on it. What, you think you're the only one that can figure out how to plant cameras, detective? Look around you. You're being recorded right now. The whole world just watched you break into my office and threaten me. You're lying. [SCOFFS] You really think that this is my only copy of your disgusting little obsession? There are copies on their way right now to every news outlet and newspaper in the city. Prove it. Show me the camera. [GROANING] Show me the camera. Okay. Let go of me. It's behind you. Right behind you. Ow! [WHIMPERING] Help! Oh, my... I thought that you were different, you know? I thought you were the one. All right, get off her! [GROANING] Liam. No... Are you okay? Liam, watch out! Oh! [PANTING] Okay, okay... We could've been happy. Why wouldn't you let me, huh? Why wouldn't you let me make you happy? [VOICE BREAKING] Why wouldn't you let me make you happy? Why wouldn't you let me make you happy? I'm sorry. [GUNSHOT] [GASPING] Liam! Get up! You're okay. Come on, we have to go. We have to go. Yes, I need an ambulance at 424, 10th Avenue. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] AMANDA: That looks great, ladies. I love it. Could you all look at each other and laugh? You're best friends. Yes, yes. And then look here and smile. And, yeah. It's great. It's great. I think we have it. Let's move on to the next setup. You can take a break. Oh, thanks. Looks good. [CHUCKLES] Well, I'm a pretty good photographer. Yeah, and pretty cute, too. [CHUCKLES] I'm, uh, gonna go check something over here. Okay. Hey, uh, Ms. Carlson. Do you mind if I show you something real quick? Sure. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Okay. Okay. Right over here. It's going great. Yeah, thank you. You've gotta be kidding me. I wanted to bring you up-to-date on your case after the incident. Oh, you mean the incident where your detective tried to kill us and you ignored every warning sign? We found quite a few of his victims. The department has asked me to personally apologize to them and to you and to offer our condolences. I don't want your condolences, Captain. And I hope next time you can offer more than condolences and actually help somebody. I have something to show you. I can't do this right now. Amanda, please. What? I have something I have to show you. Have you seen this picture? I don't need to see anything else. The case is closed like you said. Have you seen this picture? Yes, it's the photo that was accidentally taken the night that Dawson attacked me. Right. But have you taken a careful good look at it? AMANDA: Yes. Why? Because the man in the picture isn't Dawson. What do you mean? I had Forensics do a digital refinement of it. The man in this picture isn't Dawson. It's... Amanda. Come on, we got work to do. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. AMANDA: Liam? I'm so sorry, Amanda. [SOBBING] AMANDA: Oh, my God. This has turned out perfect. CARLSON: It's exactly what we're looking for. The old-school talking... Freeze! Hands where I can see 'em. Amanda, Amanda, please. Amanda, please help me! Amanda, I'm innocent, okay? I didn't do... [GRUNTING] Amanda, please! I didn't do anything! I'm innocent. Get off of me! Amanda, please! Amanda! [MUMBLES] Look, I've got a lot riding on this deal. I'll do whatever it takes to develop this property. What's unclear about that? Yeah, well, push back harder. Don't wanna hear from you until it's done. Mm. Your lawyers? Mm-hm.
