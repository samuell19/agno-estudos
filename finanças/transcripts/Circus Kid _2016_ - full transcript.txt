Here's the thing. When I was a kid, I just wanted to open my father's closet and see a bunch of suits. But when I'd open my father's closet, I'd see... Baggy checkered pants, jackets with huge flowers, shoes the size of my body. Every day of my childhood, as far back as I can remember, I watched my father slip, trip, fall on his face, fall on his back, juggle clubs, juggle balls, juggle people. My father has busted open his chin, cracked his ribs, dislocated his shoulder, broken both legs, sprained both ankles, and he did all that trying to make jokes. Hello, everybody! Welcome to The Pickle Family Circus! My father started the Pickles before I was born. It was the family business. This is my sister, Gypsy. This is my mom, Peggy. And this is my dad, Larry. He ran the whole show. Most kids dream about running away from home to join the circus. But for me, the circus wasmy home. I had to join. Your father had incredible dynamism, like a bull often in the best and sometimes the worst sense. Wait a minute. See, look, I'm doing a solo routine now. I do the hat thing, then you take the hat. I'm doing the carrot. You take the carrot. He was somebody you looked to because he was an authority, this wunderkind. But it was hard. I have to do my own solo club routine. He knew exactly what he wanted to do, and he was so self-assured. I was obviously ready to run away with him, and then all those other people followed. His standards were so high, but you feel like there is somewhat of a powder keg there sometime, you know? And I just... I guess I'm afraid of it a little bit. Well, it's no Ringling Brothers. But then again, it doesn't want to be. It has one ring, no wild animals. The Pickle Family Circus just might be the show you'd be happy to have your child run away with. The troupe's youngest member is Larry's son, Lorenzo. Now, Lorenzo, you joined the circus at what age? - Two. - Two. You have a hard time remembering back that far. I would imagine so. What did you do at the age of two with the circus? I was a clown. You were a clown also. What is the best thing about being in the circus? - Get a lot of money. - You get a lot of money. That's not a bad... Best thing about anything. What's the worst thing about being in the circus? Um... I don't get to play a lot. You don't get to play a lot. And then again, you can always quit when you want to, right? Right. Now, stage right with that catwalk. Okay. I'm going to... In 1 minute. Lorenzo. You can't control that this is coffee break. It's not... It's not time yet. When I switch this motor, it's the exact same side. Ready? Tell me when you're untied. If we can put the trunk on its spike and then try to close the curtain. Yeah, there you go. I think that's about it. I'll roll it up. It turns out, it's pretty hard to quit the family business. These days, I'm a legit New York actor. The irony is that, the most success that I've ever had as an actor has been in this play that I helped create about what it was like growing up with my clown dad. My name is Lorenzo. My father is a clown, and I have suffered from years of humor abuse. I've done over 500 performances of this play, telling my father's story, wearing his hat, walking in his shoes, doing his acts, trying, in the only way I know how, to figure out who he is. And after all this, I still don't know a thing about him. I only know the clown. What I think of when I think of your father is a huge question, so I can only chip away... We're good? Okay. Sorry. All right. How do you feel about me asking you questions on camera? Not enthusiastic, but go ahead. I agreed to do it. Hello. Check. Check. Check, check, check. How is it to answer question like this, for you? Yeah, you guys want to have some food before? I mean, I don't want you dropping over dead. It's not like I want to, like, put this off or anything. I think she was skirting the issue. I'm being really honest. I hope you don't use any of this. It's hard to push these people into areas that they don't want to go to. I can't remember one thing about it. - I don't... I can't remember. - I don't remember. I can't remember. Now you're putting me on the spot. I don't know. You'd have to ask him. What is the thing you're most afraid to ask him? Why he left? I think. And to ask him about the drinking. Dad? Come on in. - Sure. Will this upset you? - Let me just... No. Now, Lorenzo, if you're about the height of the camera, it's better, but if you want me to come up higher... No, no. That's... I'm not... I'm just going to tell you right now. I may no tell you the truth. Good. Probably most of this stuff is made up anyway. You should be aware of that. All right. Let's see here. So in the play, I say... My father ran away from home at 15 to be a painter. Is that made up? Well, I was having a hard time in high school, so I left and found myself in New York City in the late '60s. How old were you? Probably 17 or 18 or 16. I was going to either be a painter or do something. Who knows what? But I found a job putting together this night club called The Electric Circus. I would say that I've noticed your father when he became the followspot operator at The Electric Circus. I figured I'd get a job in concessions. The story is, "Well, do you know anything about followspots?" And I lied, and I said, "Sure." And I figured, "How hard could it be?" I had to go with a unicycle and three clubs on a crowded dance floor. So I went to your dad, and I said, "When my record comes on, can you pick me up?" And he goes to a pin spot on the pedal of my foot. And then as I swing up onto the unicycle, he opens the irises back up. And I'm like, "There is something about this followspot operator that I've never seen before in my life." And eventually, he went from followspot operator to director of the show. I invited him to come to sessions at my circus studio in The Bowery. Hovey had these Saturday morning sessions where anybody, you didn't have to go to NYU, you just came and you kind of met anybody interested in circus in that room. It was so vibrant and new. I'd never seen anything like it. I was a sponge. I picked up on this stuff very, very quickly. We juggled until we dropped. I really formed my ideas about circus with Hovey. And I know there were these new theater companies in San Francisco, so that's where I went. ♪♪ Free show at 2:00! Look at that woman! This is the San Francisco Mime Troupe. The Mime Troupe conceives of itself as a radical alternative to commercial theater that snipes at the conventions of middle-class America. Today, the miser is out of date. I just called up the Mime Troupe and said, "I can teach you to walk a wire and stilts and all this stuff." They were mostly college students. I didn't have a background like theirs at all, but no one ever asked me how old I was. Your mom didn't ask me how old I was, you know, until it was too late. I could not believe this guy. He walked into the office saying he wanted to teach circus classes. He had this beard that a 19-year-old should not be capable of growing. It was perfectly sculpted. He was training us in circus skills right from the beginning. He was very authoritative and a very good teacher. And he was held in a high esteem. Powerful, energetic. We went away together that weekend. Did you take to the circus stuff? Taketo it? No, I didn't take to it! I hated it! I had been terribly shy, so I did not perform with the Mime Troupe. I am doing the costumes, the sets. But because of Larry, I got over that. When I met Peggy, she had a baby. Her name was Gypsy. The two of them were beautiful, and I was smitten. My plan was, once we reached a certain skill level, then I would propose the idea of putting the circus together, but a new kind of circus. The state of the circus in those days was three rings, a lot of animals. Clowns were used to cover the rigging changes. It wasn't really considered an art. It was an entertainment. You know, there was Ringling Brothers, and even it was not particularly attractive at that point. It was these distant superheroes, you know? Interesting, but, you know, so was the popcorn. My idea about circus was, it wasn't just for kids. There were lots of issues. The Vietnam War was still going, and there was the beginnings of farm worker's organizations. Cesar Chavez was organizing the Central Valley in California. The second wave of feminism was going strong, and I wanted to make some contribution in that way. So I started a juggling act. Yep, you're going to get it. Okay. Give me the hat. Hold the clubs. What's this "give me?" I said ask nicely! No, don't touch the clubs. I'm doing a solo routine. - This is a shortcut. - You do this every show. You come in, "Give me a shortcut." My shortcut! And you take the clubs, and you make me look like a ninny! Now, cut it out! Hey! It's not taking the clubs that makes you look like a ninny. Don't do my routine! I'm going to do it! - Don't get pushy with me! - Don't push me around! I cannot... What are you doing here? I'm going to get those clubs, and I'm going to do it by myself. You got them? You got them? You got them? - Come on! It was an attempt to use juggling as an expression of a healthier relationship between a man and a woman. So it was always about one-upping me, and me thinking that I was still the man. Hold the clubs into my hands. So the first comedy juggling act that had a feminist theme. No more! No more! Okay. - Hey! Hey! - Not... Excuse me. I forgot my hat. Don't throw the clubs like that. Now, where did everybody go? Wait a minute. I would like to explain. I would like to... But I got the hat. We were actually good, and I thought that we were ready to put a circus together. So I said, "I'll help." I saw in The San Francisco Examiner, the ad. It was about this big, and I think it said, "Wanted: Jugglers, tumblers, equilibrists, for new circus." We had made a date, and your mother and father drove me to the Mime Troupe studio where I auditioned for them. And I was trying the plate business that I had learned in the Ringling School. Go on. Give me that one. No, don't throw some more. That's it! Oh! Wait a minute, Tony! You don't give me a chance! It was actually just a plate thing. There was no spaghetti yet. Larry said, "Yeah, well, if we're going to do a spaghetti routine, there needs to be some spaghetti." Oh, Tony, I'm getting nervous a little bit. But I'll tell you what, I'll do... The circus did its first performances at a Mission Daycare in the Mission, and that's where I saw the jugglers and Bill. And I said to myself, "This is interesting." Bill said that I should audition Geoff Hoyle, who was a British performer, and he was incredible. So we became a trio of clowns. I think they really inspired each other, and I think their three senses of humor were very complementary. Is Mr. Hitchcock here yet? And I, as a young connoisseur of clowns, really had an opinion about all three of them. Bill was always a very soft, romantic, poetic. Geoff, for me, was always kind of cynical. And Larry really had the smart, but tragic, the Buster Keaton. There was always a little bit of darkness in there. He was the fearless leader. When your father would do that reach, he'd go but he'd be out parallel to the ground. - Yeah. - Oh, that was good. So that was high-level clowning. We were writing, rehearsing all the time. Yeah. - Hand it to you? - Yeah. You know something? I'm tired to be a wage slave. - The telephone. - And it must be... Your padrone. BOTH: The boss! - Oh, what should I do? - Answer it. Okay. I can tell you're not impressed. Clowns had their own moxie for what was going to be presented, and then Larry had a sense of the other acts that were going to come together and make what was going to be a whole show. In the early days, I was developing my theory of circus. Circus actually takes place best in a single ring with each performer having their turn. So the audience relationship between the performer and the individual person in the audience is what's key. On the larger shows, you're hundreds of yards away, and you really can't see who is doing what. In the Pickles, you could. Larry did this incredible thing. It was sort of almost visionary, you know, and very incredibly generous, as well. I swallowed the Kool-Aid so completely. Us idealistic little nitwits were feeling like, "Rah-rah! This is how we're going to make the world a better place." We weren't hippies. MacKINNON: We were way too busy trying to be professionals. Larry loved being in charge of the circus, and Peggy sewed the side walls to this whole place together on a sewing machine with canvas. I went to a sailmaker, and I said, "I want canvas of this size," and I painted it. All of a sudden, it was all put together, and there it was. It was a show. And then Michael Nolan comes in with The San Francisco Examiner, and there is, above the fold, a full-size picture of the show. And we're all going, "Holy shit. That's us." Your father's acts were immaculately conceived. I mean, the gorillas coming out of the trunk. It was brilliant. It was Larry's genius as a director which made the Pickle Family great, his overall sense as a painter, if you'd like. And I think it influenced all the new circuses, the start of Cirque Du Soleil and all these other small groups that have now populated and they're all over the world. Critics and authors began to see this movement emerging, so-called new circus. And there they were, Peggy and Larry, seeing it as the focus of their lives. Our life was our work, and our work was our life. It was that kind of thing. It was all-consuming. I mean, you have to... When I started it, I was 24. That, I think about from time to time whenever I meet someone who is that age. I think, "What was I thinking?" We all knew there was a life outside. You did know? Well, we thought we knew. Yeah. Hard to believe it ended the way it did. Yeah. You know what? I need to stop. Wow. This is where the trapeze was put to practice swinging. Well, here we live in this gorgeous old church, a space that's just big enough to put the ring and a little space in the back for the band to be rehearsing. Luckily enough, this space has a ceiling that's just high enough to deal with the fact that these guys spend a fair amount of time high in the air. Those years, when you were working together, you guys were creating all that stuff, do you remember those as the happiest years? Yeah. It was great because there was a spirit. Everyone got into the spirit of the thing. Every single town that we went into, we had a connection to the community. We didn't raise that much money for other people, but what we did was provide for them an opportunity to learn how to organize themselves. I think everybody bought into that. It felt like the first real family that I had. Began in 1970... And things were really wonderful with Peggy and I. And I thought, "Well, okay. Here is my little family." 74. 1975. I get to be in a family. It felt great to actually unpack the truck and set up the thing. Both Peggy and Larry were very inclusive and welcoming to anybody who wanted to jump on board their crazy-ass idea and help make it work. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ A lot of us needed some version of family, and there it was. It was, like, this half camp life, half get up and get ready for the show. The minute we unzipped the tent, you kind of were in your pajamas, in this world, wondering who was awake, who was cooking, who was preparing for the day. It was just so much fun for those five years. - The first 5? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, the first 5 years. Love doing this. And up! What I would like to do is, is do the Lummox routine, and then I want to run transitions. Let's go. When my father started performing, he decided to name his clown character Lorenzo. And then when I was born a few years later, he named me Lorenzo. He named me after the clown. Larry, you know, pater familias, preserve the tradition. We must keep this going. You know? The assumption is that, the kids are going to be in the circus. The assumption is, you're going to continue the line. Living up to my expectations, I think it's normal when you're a child. You want to impress your parents. I made my circus performing debut... uninvited. I was two years old, and this was during intermission. One day, you walked into the ring carrying your little suitcase. We heard the audience laughing, so we looked through. You opened your little suitcase and pulled out two small bowling pins that we'd given you, and you shook them as fast as you could, lifted your hat up, signaled to the audience, turned around, and walked off. I remember watching you through the hole in the backdrop like, "Oh, my God. Can you believe this?" That was, like, the first time, and then the fifth time, "Yeah, he's still out there. My dad became my coach, my boss, really. He'd spend hours with me just to teach me a single trick. He could balance all sorts of stuff, tubas, chairs, juggling clubs. So when I was five, he set out to teach me how to balance a hat on my nose. I would put the hat on my nose, and it would immediately fall. On my nose, fall. On my nose, fall. Not a moment of success. "I can't do it," I would say. "Can't do it... yet," he would reply, not, "Here, let me help you." You didn't like to rehearse that much. "How many times do I have to trip? How many times do I have to practice this move?" You didn't understand why you had to keep doing things over again. So how would you handle that? I said, "Do it again." you know? Play is one thing. But if you're going to work with me, pal, you better be good. That was really what it was about, and you were good. That phrase is burned into my brain, "Do it again. Do it again. Do it again." I saw it as love, but Lorenzo left all the time. And for a while, we had this corral to keep him in and he got out. He was just, like, gone. Eventually, my dad put bells on my shoes and made me wear a pin and it read, "I'm Lorenzo. I belong to the circus." With Larry, we were a family that was working together, performing together. And if you wanted to do it, you had to do it. One year, he wanted to integrate me into one of the acrobatic routines. Until then, as a kid, he had, you know, thrown me around. And, you know, I think there was an aspect of it that was family fun. But as soon as it became something that was actually to be in the show, the dynamic changed. He was a disciplinarian. He wanted her to do things correctly. How was that for you? I wanted her to do things correctly, whatever that means. But, I mean, fine. They cross underneath, so it looks like... His idea was, he had someone on his shoulders, and then I would scale him and then scale another person on top of him and be standing basically the third person high. Climbing up by yourself one person's body and then another person's body and feeling it shaking below me was really scary. But what was even more scary was being treated by my step-father in a professional realm. Like, I couldn't unblur the lines. And I'm your daughter, and you're my coach. I had to do it again and again and again, and I premiered the trick. I just remember seeing the lights in my face, going up, doing the trick, coming down, exiting the stage, and just bursting into tears. Yes, I was dynamic. Yes, I was strong. Yes, I was driven, you know? I didn't really understand why people would be afraid of me, but I didn't consider it my problem. As I got older, he taught me acrobatics, trapeze, juggling. He also taught me how to fall down stairs. Oh, geez! Whoa! Do it again. Let gravity be your friend. That's what he said. First of all, I never taught you how to fall down a flight of stairs. - Yes. You did! - No. I did not. I was teaching somebody else at that time. But I remember you saying that... I said, "Let gravity be your friend," when you were falling into the pit. You mean, when I was falling six feet backwards into a dark pit? It wasn't six feet. It was less than four. - I was little. - You weren't that little. There was a fun, circus, wonderful feeling in the '70s, but I always felt that I was part and parcel of something else, not necessarily my own life. Everything revolved around the show. You know, we were just constantly packing and unpacking, setting up and tearing down to get the next place. Everyone was really focused on what they needed and on the work. Why would I not want anyone to teach you how to hang from a trapeze or drive a truck, I mean, whatever it was? And what a relief for me. I could go do the books. The thought is going through my mind sometimes, where were the adults on this? I don't think we were bad people, but my God, we were all so self-centered at each step of the way with our little blinders on. Was there ever any Child Protective Services issues, by the way? I mean, did anyone ever come up and say, "How is that kid?" Or does that fall under the, "It was a different era" column. No. No. There were child labor laws, which we were aware of. You knew they existed somewhere. We decided to homeschool you guys, but we never went through the state. We knew this guy who owned a book store, and so he would give you these assignments. There was school, but it was circus school. The idea of just going off and doing something for fun? Never. We never did that. Something that I'm fearful of with Lorenzo is that, you know, at 23 years of age, he's going to come to me and say, "Where was my childhood?" You know, I don't want that to happen, so then I do a lot to encourage him to go off and go to the park, or go play with other kids. When I was six, my dad took me into one of the offices of the circus. He laid a piece of paper out on the desk in front of me and said, "This is a contract." And then he said, "I don't want to take away your childhood." So he left me alone in the office to think about it. All of a sudden, I was under contract. I should've maybe said, "I'm not sure about this. Yeah. It makes sense. It's what circuses do." And it was almost a sense that I should be saying, "This is traditional, and we should let this happen." And then there was another part of me that was saying, "You're a nurturing father. You don't have to push your kid into this." I was afraid of him, or afraid of his knowledge, or afraid of his expectation. I have no doubt in my mind that both Peggy and Larry must have thought, "Is this really going to be okay? How bad are the therapy bills going to be?" There was no one that Larry would rather work with than you, and he had this brilliant idea for an act. The act my father created for us was based on the story of Pinocchio. My father was like the puppet-maker, Gepetto, and I was like Pinocchio. For this act, my dad wanted me to look exactly like him. There was also a wooden puppet, which my mother made, that looked exactly like me trying to look like my father. Backstage, I got inside the trunk next to the puppet of myself. The lid was locked. The trunk was lifted up for my father to get underneath. Laying there, in the dark, through the air holes my father had drilled, pin points of light moved across the trunk's walls as he carried me around the ring. I loved doing this. There was a serenity, an ease, and comfort to all of this. My father's back against mine. A routine I knew well. It was fun. I was my father's clown partner for four years, from ages 6 to 10. We toured the states together, living in his Dodge van. We ate every meal together, and we worked on stage as partners every day. You and I were really close when I was a kid. Yeah. I didn't have any idea of what my dad did, and I felt it was important you understood what my work was, so I made room for you to be part of it. What was it like between you and your dad? We didn't have much of a relationship. My dad was a workaholic. He was a manager of stores, and then he was a supervisor of some stores. I don't know if he really was into the idea of being a dad. I mean, my dad was 19 when I was born. I think my mom may have just turned 16, or she was 15. I don't remember. As a kid, you can feel that things were not going right. When I was a teenager, my dad moved the whole family to Puerto Rico. We were all there as a family. Dad was working for this company. My mom was miserable. I would come home, and my mom would be up in her room, and she'd say she was reading, but you could smell the alcohol on her breath. It was terrible. I felt, you know, cut off. I came home one day from school, and the house was empty. My mom packed up and went back to Long Island, and left me. My dad needed someone to watch his store in a town on the other side of the island, and I went and lived by myself and took care of this store. And it was from there that I left to start a new life in New York City. Did you ever try to reach your dad? No. He disappeared for almost a decade. He just disappeared. So how did you find him? His wife said, "You know, you need to get in touch with your son." So he called me. I didn't know how it was when he said, "Larry." And then he said, "This is your dad." I have a recollection of being at the Carolina Street House when your father picked up the phone, and he said, "Daddy!" And then I met his father. His father was cooking hamburgers behind the circus lot. I just sort of remember hearing, "Larry's dad is here!" "What? Are you kidding me? Larry's dad is here?" You had just been born, and I thought, "Well, it's probably important for him to see you. And I wanted him to see the circus. How was that? Meeting him? It was bizarre. You know, who are you? But I was thinking, you know, that as an adult, maybe he and I could do what you and I are doing right now, and say, "What was going on?" Right. Have an adult conversation between a father and a son. But then the year after he'd seen you, he was killed in an automobile accident. Kind of the next thing we knew was that he died, and was Larry going to go to the funeral? But he had a show to put on, so he didn't. It was sort of not the same again. Just... like that. We would come offstage, and he would sit and cry, and would not talk to me. So what would you do? Well, let's say your husband has got cancer. Do you leave him? Let's say your husband is clinically depressed. Do you leave him? I mean, it was not good, and he always said, "Oh, no. I can fix myself. I'm going to be like Sid Caesar." I remember my dad saying, "Tragedy inspires comedy." The death of his father was inspirational. His whole clown persona changed. I really missed it when his clown stopped talking, and not using his personal darkness in the work felt to me like something was splitting. When can you use your voice? If I... Okay? - Now. - Hi, Larry. The more depressed he got, the more happy his clown got. Lorenzo Pickle of the later Pickle Family Circus was skillful, of course, but somehow didn't have the life force of truth. Young members of the circus board, they were feeling that the circus needed a new sensibility. Their thing was, "We really don't think Larry should be in the show. You know, his clowning is just... Please, give me a break." And I wanted to fucking strangle them. At the same time, I thought, "I know." By this time, both Jeff and Bill had left the Pickles. They were doing their own thing. Bill was in New York doing work that earned him a MacArthur Fellowship, otherwise known as the Genius Award. And Jeff stayed in San Francisco, creating solo shows and exploring comedy outside the circus ring. I was attempting to self-medicate, and I was in trouble. I mean, I was drinking way too much. Were you drinking when we were on stage together? Occasionally. I had burnt out, and I have to admit, I was a little crazy. Not a little, I was certifiably out there. When our leader is out of control, is not hiding it, like, driving the truck in Washington Square Park drunk out of his mind. How did I not know this was going on? You were protected from a lot of that. So all those years that I thought were the greatest in the Pickles, they were the worst for Larry? Yeah. When it all blew up was in Philadelphia. One of the technicians left a ladder onstage. Larry, like, lost it. They left the ladder on when the public came in, and I was angry. But he ran, and then I ran after him. I said, "I'm not finished talking to you." He was yelling and chasing him in circles all around the lot. So here's this technician, running away from my angry clown-dad, who is basically carrying a hand-balancer, and a couple of musicians who are trying to hold my dad down, which was hard because he was also pretty drunk. And then someone got pushed, and Harvey Robb, the saxophone player who had never missed a show, turned to Larry and said, "I never condone any kind of physical violence." I think it was the first time that I went, "I'm going to have to agree with that guy," and not my step-dad. What it felt like to me was mutiny. How was that for you to say? Not a bit of fun. Very difficult, and Larry did not take it well. I remember not wanting to go on stage with him after that meeting, but I had signed a contract. Our music began, and we went on, and it felt like work. What happened after Philly? I don't know, really. I mean, I remember, yes. I remember a staged intervention. I think it was at Bloom's Bar. I think there was an intervention. But you weren't there. I think I was there. I didn't... No, I didn't really know. I kind of shut myself off from it a bit. And he said to me, "Yeah. My circus. They want me out of my circus that I started." People really, really, really wanted him to separate from the company, so that was helped to happen. You know, now I have talked to a lot of people who have said that you were asked to leave. No. I decided. I decided to leave. I didn't get the impression that people were sad to see me go... but I was glad to get out of there. You know? There goes the baby. There goes the bath water. It completely shifted. Everything shifted. It's a different chapter now. I traveled with him, ate with him, spent all my time, onstage and off, with him. And then when I was 10, it was just over. Poof. He was gone. In the circus, when a season is over, circus people say, "See you down the road." So I was, "Yeah, Dad. See you down the road." When my dad left, I took on his roles. I tried to be a leader in rehearsal, in performance, in the ring. My mom stayed in San Francisco, keeping the business going because she felt responsible for everyone's jobs. So I had to take care of myself on tour, alone, at 11. I took myself out to small-town diners. I did my own laundry. I did have two legal guardians. One was a clown named Queenie... And the other was the saxophone player, Harvey. What Peggy had asked me, I mean, it was sort of more of a strict legal thing. I was not really appointed to be your parent or surrogate parent. I had not been aware that you were, you know, eating pancakes alone and felt isolated. I mean, I couldn't have been in my right mind, to... I mean, now, you would never do that. I don't do that with my dog. You know? But... it seemed to work. It seemed... It was fine. Hello, and welcome to the 14th season of the Pickle Family Circus. The circus has been my home for all my life, and I hope you'll make it yourhome for today because I really think you'll like the show. We have almost everything. I mean, we have a cool band, slick jugglers, amazing acrobats, dynamite aerialists, and you won't even believe the second half! The one thing we don't have is a clown. And I think we need one. Don't you? I was working as hard as I could, but without Larry, the Pickles just weren't the same. The company struggled with, "All right. How is it possible that we might become the business model that we need to be in order to make it." And that never happened. Helen, are we paying our bills this week? We're trying. We're trying our damndest. We hope we can pay our bills this week. But by the late '80s, only four years after Larry left, we could see the writing on the wall. The "Me" generation was in full bloom, and what he had created was pretty much suffering from that. You know, Cirque du Soleil had come to the United States with all their government funding and commercial backing, and here we were, still living in vans and tents. Everyone was drinking. Everyone was snorting coke, and the line between, "I'm entertaining myself" and "I'm blotting out" can be blurred. That's Tom. He bounces when he's not lying around on the floor. I don't know where Larry was at this time. No one in the Pickles knew. But every once in a while, I would get a short letter in the mail full of regret. We were approaching the holiday shows, and I woke up terrified, and I didn't know why. And I finally realized, I have to leave the circus. You know, we put this together as a way to have a family, to have the village. But that had really changed. I called the President of the Board, and I say, "I have to leave the circus today." And bless his heart, he said, "Fine." He said, "Let's go over to the office. We'll just tell everybody right now." And I said, "Wow. Okay." And we did. We did. I left the circus that day. I left the Pickles, too, and chose to go to a regular high school in San Francisco. I was confronted with grunge music, people my own age, and prom. I still didn't hear much from my dad. I knew he was doing acts in other peoples' circuses, but nothing much. When he came back to circus, I barely recognized him. Hunched over, the long, curly hair, definitely looked much older than his age. I just said to him, "Look. I don't know what happened to you, but there's one thing that I can't respect or understand in that you left Mom to take care of everything." And he said, "You have to understand, I've been living hand-to-mouth for years." I was like, "What do you mean, you've been living hand... You created a whole circus. You've created shows. Like, do something." And it was sort of by then that I realized he was really beaten down. When I think about the platform that the Pickles was for so many people, I think he thought that platform was going to be for himself, and it became bitter before it could become sweet. The rest of us had moved on. I had moved to New York to start my career as an actor. My sister, Gypsy, had married a juggler and started her own circus. Of course, what one person thinks is weird... And my mom remarried and became a sculptor. The Pickles were largely forgotten... until out of the blue, Larry was asked to return to New York to do a show with his old clown partners. Larry, Bill, and I were asked to do something, and we said, "Well, we'll put together the three musicians." We were on the bill as "Clown Reunion." They would pay our way, and pay us some money, and yes. I often wonder now what he was thinking that night. He came to New York decades earlier as a teenage runaway in search of opportunity, and he found it. Maybe he thought he could find it again. Maybe he thought this would be a comeback. It was a very tight stage, but we sort of paced it out, and Larry had decided that he was going to do a 108, where you land on your back. You don't make it to your feet. And he had done this many, many times in the circus. It was always sort of like a spectacular moment. He steps forward to do this 108, and it's usually a trip and then a throw. And he threw it high. I just remember seeing him go so high in the air. I said, "Wow. That was incredible." And he came down and something what wrong. And I went, "Ooh. He pulled it tight. He threw it too high, and he pulled it close." And he left stage, and then he was supposed to come back, and Hoyle came out and whispered in my ear, "Pisoni is hurt. He's not coming back out." Larry is lying on the floor in the wings, and he says to me, "I can't move. I can't get up. You guys do it. You guys do the tune." You know, I was flirting with some woman, and I was in my whiteface, and "Ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah, you want to try the nose on?" And we got Larry down the street to the loft on 20th Street, and he's hurting, but I don't know that we took it seriously enough. My memory is of shoving him up the stairs like, "Boy, I got places I got to go." And I have never... Ever felt right about that... In relation to your father... To whom I owe a great deal. Oh! After taking aspirin for eight months, he finally went to the hospital and was told that he had broken his back. I'd been doing that move since I was 17 years old, so I did it one time too many. You know, you pay a price. There's a time to stop, I think, you know? I didn't understand what happened. My life was my work, and the other way around. I thought that was a good thing at 29, 30 years old or whatever. I thought, "Oh, well this seems like the complete life." You know, but I think it's one of the things that contributed to my going off the deep end. Really? Yeah. Do you have regrets as a father? Yeah. I would've liked for that whole thing not to have happened, but it did, so... There's a saying in the I Ching which is, "Omit no steps." So I omitted a lot of steps along the way during your childhood. Mm-hmm. What do you think your legacy is? What is my legacy? You know, I did make this circus when there wasn't one like it anywhere. That's a legacy, I suppose. My clown material was... it was all original, but I think more importantly, it's you and Gypsy. So you think Gypsy and I had a good childhood? I hope you had a good childhood, but I'm not the one who could describe it as a good childhood. Do you think you had a good childhood? - Do you want shoes? - I want shoes. I think I have clubs somewhere. I used to have band saw on top of this. Here it is. Oh, I just found a box that says "Old Clown Shoes." What could be in there? That's a globe, rolling globe. The blue one that was painted red or was blue? It's now gold. It's now gold? You want to see that? I want to get on it. I want to get that. I love that globe. You should find your clown shoes. I know. You were, like, half your size. Don't look down. - Shh! - No, I'm not kidding. Don't look down. Relax your shoulders. Stop! Stop! - Bring back memories? - Yes! Relax your shoulders. Sorry, but, you know... And straighten your back! What are you doing? I've stopped performing the play about my dad. I feel that I've sufficiently walked in his shoes and worn his jacket and his hat. His way of dealing with things was walking away. I don't want to fall into the same traps as my father. I don't want to repeat walking away. That's for sure. Look at that belly! Oh, my gosh! - He's in there. - Oh, my gosh. - He's pretty quiet right now. He was rocking and rolling when I woke up this morning. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, my God. I'm a little afraid of having kids. Oh, man. I mean, I'm excited at the prospect. Yeah, I'm afraid of having kids. I got to figure out, actually, what I'm doing about... I'd like them not to have any pressure... but then I want them to excel. - Not even born yet! - And they're not even here. They're not even on the planet. That's a bad sign.
