Author Paulo Coelho of 'The Alchemist' once said, "When you want something," "all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." Isn't that great? Why don't we all make a wish today? May the universe work in helping you achieve your dreams. Here's our next song. LEE SOON-JAE PRIVATE TAXI JUNG YOUNG-SOOK CHO HAN-CHEUL BAE HAE-SUN LEE YE-WON YE MOO-YOUNG KIM GI-CHEON story by LEE YOUN-EE written by YOON JONG-MIN LEE CHANG-GEUN produced by SIN YOUNG-IL directed by LEE CHANG-GEUN Grandma! You got perfect! Way to go! All thanks to my teacher! Way to go, Eun-ji! Hello, Grandpa! Where's the food? Food? I forgot! I'll set the table. Forget it! Where's your head! Eun-ji! Let's eat! Gotcha! I lost again! You always 'talk' the same! What is 'talk'? It's a word In English. You're always predictable. Now, I should learn English from you. Watch me. 1 is one! 2 is two! 3 is three! 4 is four! 5 is five! Wow! What's with the sand? Why is there sand in the room? You don't even clean when all you do is stay home? Aren't you eating? Bye, Grandpa! Grandpa is so mean! - He is, isn't he? - Yes! Want some meat? Your favorite? Yes! Yes! You always come out right after Grandpa leaves! How'd you know? Put her down! You'll hurt your back! I have no use for it. Just give me the cab and buy a new one. The new ones are nice. It's an antique with class! People stare at my car when I drive around. Mercedes or BMWs can't compare. Antique? Yeah, right. They stare because it's odd, not nice! I'd rather change my wife, than this! Be good to your family as long as you can move. Or else they won't take care of you when you're down and out. That's your sad story, pal. Why you! - Come up for coffee. - Sure. What's Jin-soo up to? Why do you ask? - Will you give him a job? - That's right. I can't run this alone anymore. If he's not busy, tell him to come and work here. Who cares if he has his PhD? This is a skill worth knowing too. Why you! Not anyone can get PhDs! Forget it then! Meals included? Why you! What's this? Kim ordered stuff with my phone, so it gets delivered her Good evening everyone! I feel good this evening! Oh my god! It's here at last! Sunglasses! Why waste your money? See? Swimming suits! You'd better bring us back gifts! Finally smartened up after your wife got sick, huh? At least, I smartened up. I want to dress up and take her on a plane for once. You'll drive us to the airport, right? You are my best friend! Thank you very much! How dare he! Grandma? That man had an affair with another woman? Then that girl before was his daughter? You're right! Oh no! Eighteen! What? Eighteen! What? Don't say that. It sounds like a swear word in Korean! Okay. Eighteen! I'm home. Hi! You must be tired. Go rest up. Did you finish your homework? I'm watching TV! Don't interrupt me, Mom! Oh my! Stop and wash these. I'm playing a game! Don't interrupt me! Dang. What? Where'd you get these? If you can't buy new ones, just wash them. I am. Can't we move out? Why? We're saving money by living here. My mom takes care of Eun-ji. Isn't that nice? You can help out by working. Jung-hee, I have good news. Professor Hong called today, so I met him. You know my senior, right? - You want to be a professor still? - Things look good. A professor got in a bad car accident. He's in a coma. It's bad. If he doesn't wake up by the end of this term, then I can take his spot. Just give it up, will you? Sop dreaming about that or I'll knock some sense into you! It people don't dream, it means they're dead. Grow up, will you? You can't say a word to your father. You still haven't figured me out? I have a temper too, you know? I'm keeping patient for peace in the family. Watch me! If he says anything again, I'll... Where's Jin-soo! Come out here now! What did you do? Screwed up again? They're all bars! While everyone works hard to get a job, that pathetic fool goes drinking! Come out here now! He has to meet people to get a job. Talk to him tomorrow. Let's go in. It's all your fault the bastard ended up like that! Don't call your son that in front of Eun-ji. Eun-ji? Go in and sleep. Go to bed. Goodnight. Hello, Father. Jin-soo must be tired from his interview today. He's sleeping. Tell him to come out before I put him to sleep for good! Stop scolding him! You heard he had a rough day. If you can't even read or write, stay out of this! Grandpa! You're mean! What? Why you little! She learned to talk back to me from watching you! Go to bed! Father! Please don't yell at her. You scare me too, when you get like this! Why you! You seem drunk. Talk to him tomorrow. How dare you! Since her mother has no manners, the kid takes me lightly too! Women are determined to ruin this family! I don't need anyone else being ignorant besides Mae-ja! Damn obscene! What did you say? I said eighteen! Eighteen? You mean 'obscene'? Damn woman! Mother! Father! Don't cry, Eun-ji. Let's go inside. Tell Eun-ji you're sorry. It's because of you! Ever seen me apologize to anyone my entire life? It's good. Try it. Aren't you eating, Mom? I don't have much of an appetite today. What? Grandma must eat something in secret at night. How did you know? Grandma? I want chicken. You want chicken? I'll buy you some later. Give me some money to buy Eun-ji some chicken later. Got no money! Money means more than Eun-ji? You can't take it with you to the grave! Damn woman! Grandma? I don't want chicken. Don't buy it, okay Get ready for kindergarten. I'll take you today. Get up. What are you doing today? Free coffee! Isn't service at Mae-ja's Salon great? Here. Is Mae-ja's Salon back open? No, it's just for today. I can always open later. - Set the timer. - Okay! Here. Good son! Helping his mom well. Not working today Do I know you? Stop asking personal questions! By the way, don't you feel more alert and stronger by sitting on this? It's an anionic mat. - What? - This is the anionic mat? You know? - Of course! - Great. Mom's backaches and headaches disappeared after sleeping on this! I bought a few with my son's employee discount. I don't even remember being sick! - Have a bad back these days. - My mother-in-law too! Your health is most important. Try it. How much? It's $300, but I'll get you the discount. I'll give it to you for $200. $100 discount? How many do you have? I asked first! Don't fight. I have lots. Mom? Need something? Mom! Are you okay Mom? Can you hear me? Yes! Is the perm formula making you dizzy? Maybe. - Scissors? - Yes, scissors. Hold on. How many do you have? How many do you want? Chicken is my favorite! - Is it that good? - Yes! Whenever I eat something good, I go like this. Funny, huh? You try. Me? S-W-I-N-G. What's the word? Swing! Bingo! You're so smart, Grandma! Really? Am I smart? Yes! Totally smart! How about a push for my great teacher? Okay! I'm ready! Okay! Power! Power! Grandma! Power! Grandma! Grandma? Stop! Grandma! Wait up! Don't go without me! Eun-ji? Why are you here? You were pushing my swing. Let's go home. Mom? Grandma acted weird today. How? She suddenly walked away while pushing me on the swing I've never seen her like that. She must've been tired. - Don't ride too long next time. - Okay. We'll have to wait for the results, but it doesn't appear to be mere forgetfulness. AS you can sense your symptoms, it means it'll happen more often from now on. There's a construction site down that way. There are nails fallen from trucks everywhere. I have my PhD! Hi! Any news? He's not awake yet? No, I'm not happy about it. And that professor? Jeez! Shit! No, I wasn't talking to you. What How can I play golf! No, I wasn't shouting. I'm excited to play. Set a date with the professor and I'll take care of the rest. If I become a professor, it's good for you too! Let's talk more over dinner. Good afternoon! Are you going abroad? Yes! USA! Lucky you! Did a good thing happen? Yes. What's that? Another one? Someone must be spilling nails on the streets! Still unemployed? Says who? My dad? Soon, I'll be a... Forget it. If it's good news, tell your dad first. Do you know how much he brags about you? You mean the world to him. He's got a temper, but he's a good man. Where are you staying in America? Hyatt Hotel. Please go to Hyatt Hotel. This can translate anything I say? Fool! Where's the bathroom! You can't swear. - Try again. - Right. Where's the bathroom? I need to pee. Mom? Why is she here? Mom! I work so hard that I'm constantly hungry. Have another bowl. One more bowl of beef soup please! Why do you look so down, Mom? You look troubled. If something's wrong, tell your son! I'll solve it for you! Son? Wanna go on a trip? We've never gone away on a family trip before. How about a trip to the sea? I went once when I was young, and never went back. I think things will really work out for me this time. Just wait a bit, Mom. I'll send you on a cruise! You can get on a big ship and sail around the world! Thank you. Enjoy your meal. This place is good. What? Can you come home early? We need to talk. What useless thing is it this time? Forget it! What is it? Say it! Can we take a trip somewhere with the kids? We've never gone anywhere before. Forget it! You can go with them! What's gotten into her? What's burning? What in the world! Hey, Mae-ja! Damn woman! Have you lost your mind! Why sit there and watch it burn? Wanna burn the house down? Who are you? Are you senile, woman! Do you know Jin-sook? I'm boiling it for Jin-sook. She's hungry. Snap out of it! I can't let her sleep. I have to wake her! Mae-ja? What's wrong? Come to your senses! I have to wake Jin-sook or else... You didn't eat dinner? What's all this smoke? Mae-ja? Don't drink cold water. You'll get diarrhea. I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. NEUROLOGIST She has dementia. It's not a rare disease at her age. But it appears she's suffering from vascular dementia. She complained about having headaches. She's expressing her memory loss and confusion as headaches. I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. You mean she's sick, right? It comes with old age. Why sound so serious to scare me? So when can she have the surgery? What can't be fixed with surgery these days? I'm sorry but it can't be treated with surgery. She'll lapse into the past more, and become more restless and agitated. If blood clots in her heart, it could be dangerous. Someone has to watch her at all times. Jin-sook... Wait! Where are you going? Jin-sook... Jin-sook... Jin-sook... Jin-sook! Jin-sook... Mister? Do you know Jin-sook? Yes. Jin-sook knows a lot of people. I know Jin-sook. She's Lee Mae-ja's daughter. And I know Lee Mae-ja very well too. You know me? Yes. Very well. Why didn't you say you went to the hospital? If I did, what would it change? Mad about spending the hospital fees or that I went without telling you? Enough with your questions! They say that helps with headaches. Let's go to the hospital. Stop it. It you suddenly change, you die early. Just keep what you're doing and live long. I got sick because I'm old. Don't make a fuss. Don't flatter yourself, Lee Mae-ja. The doctor told me to come with you. Even If you bite your tongue and die, I wouldn't blink! Don't worry. I'll die quietly alone. Eat breakfast out today. What's with her? Why isn't she answering again? Hello. What? She didn't come yet? I'll come get you. Stay where you are! Taxi! What do you mean you think she's gone When I got home, the house was a mess! Did you call the police I was going to ask you first. What? Why ask me that! Use your brain for a change! I should ask... I have an idea where... What? She's home? Mom? Why are you all wet? Help Mom get changed She could catch a cold. Let her catch it and die! Dad! If you can't grow old gracefully, just croak! Croak? Mom. Croak? You go and croak! Mom! - Why you! - Mom! You killed Jin-sook! - You killed her! - Mom! Let go! Bring Jin-sook back! - Mother! - Mom! Bring her back! - Die! - Mom! Stop! Let her go! Die! Dad! Damn car! Mom! Stop! Is It worth more than Jin-sook? Stop it, Mom! - Mom! - Had it not been for it... Mother! Please! Oh no... Mom! Let go! No! Mom? Let's go inside. Where were you while Jin-sook was sick! You said you'd be back soon! You bastard! What are you saying, Mom? - Do something, Dad! - Just leave her! Let her go crazy and croak! Mom! Mom! No! Get back! Wanna hit me like the car? Try it! You've completely lost your mind! Go on! Hit me! Damn granny! Wanna kill me? Mom! Stop! Look for a nursing home! Not a good one or anywhere close! Find the cheapest place farthest away! I don't care If she dies there or not! Dad! Mom... Can't you go tomorrow? Jin-sook's fever is high. That's why I have to go and get it now. We'll soon be out of this hell hole, Mae-ja! Jin-sook! Daddy will be back soon. Anything you wanna eat? Strawberry milk! Okay! Don't fall asleep or I'll drink it all! I'll be right back. See you later, Jin-soo! Hey, Chun. I can't believe this! This fool, Cho Nam-bong, is the owner of a cab? Stupid fool. He's his own boss now! Show some respect! Sir! Here, pal! Don't lose it! Your parents must be looking out for you in heaven. TAXI LICENSE I'm so jealous! I envy you! Nam-bong... Jin-sook. Jin-sook? Jin-sook? Jin-sook? Jin-sook. Nam-bong... Watch me! I'll make money like crazy now! I'll work hard. I'll give Mae-ja, Jin-sook, and Jin-soo everything they want! Only good things are in store for us now! Great! Let's toast! To our pal Nam-bong's new taxi business! Cheers! Get up. Hey, Kim! Lost your moves? This Is how you dance! You gotta dance! SENIOR CARE CENTER They're ready for her. Jin-soo? Come here. Why Dad? Think this place is too nice? Still, it's for Mom to... Use your head! Bastard. Get in! NURSING HOME We'll call if anything happens. Please take good care of her. We will. Go! Go on. Jung-hee. Where are my socks? Sorry, the laundry isn't dried yet. Enjoy your day, Grandpa! Bye, Dad. Why didn't she make rice instead of toast? Hi, pal. - All fixed? Then let's grab... - Kim's wife died. What? TRAVEL AMERICA How am I supposed to live without her? - Ma'am? Let's wash up. - There she is. Let go! Stop it! Ma'am? No! Let me go! Let's wash up and change into new clothes. Let go! Granny? Let go! Eun-ji! I bought snacks! She's sleeping. - Already? - Yes. - Dad's not home yet? - No. So this is how it feels with just the three of us! So earn some money. - Is it good? - Yes. But you never crave this stuff. Why all of a sudden? Never mind. Wait a minute! Hold on! What? Are you pregnant? Let's see. Stop it! Go wash up! Why do you want me to wash up? Wanna wash up together? Are you nuts! - Why? No one's home. - Stop it! Stop! Dad... Mom? Mother! Remember? Jin-soo and his wife? Mom? Go get your mom's things in the car. Sure. Grandma? Is it really you? Are you all better now? Yes. Mommy's here! Jin-sook! I'll live with you till I die. Grandma? I'm Eun-ji. Jin-sook! Jin-sook! What? There's something we'd like to discuss. What is it? Spill it! Ah... well... Dad? Did you eat? Why ask that at this hour? Is... Mom okay, now? She's fine. If that's all, go to your room and sleep. Good idea. Goodnight. We understand, but how could you bring her without discussing with us, Father? You sent her there in the first place. Yes, I did! That's why I brought her back. I can't be home to take care of her. Who asked you to take care of her? Don't worry. If you don't like it, you can go. Move out! This is my house! - Father! - Dad! You look pretty, Grandma. Not Grandma, Mom! Mom! Like it? Hello, Grandpa! Lower! That feels good. Dad? Hello, Father. Let's go on a picnic. What? That excited to go on a trip? Yes! Wear anything. It's just a picnic. Think I want to go? Did you see my red hat that was here? It's perfect for a picnic. Grandma? Wear this! - This is for me? - Yes! Eun-ji! Jung-hee! Look! What? - Happy? - Yes! CLOSED ON MONDAYS I'm hungry. Feed me. Let's go some place cool to eat. You must know many good places to eat, right? Isn't that cool? Yes, it's great! You're the best, Daddy! Stop eating! It's Eun-ji's. This is nice. Look here. Grandpa! Grandma! Smile! Not Grandma, Mom! Like it, Grandma I mean, Mom? - What is it? - What's wrong, Mom? I have to pee. I have to go too. We'll go together. Can Eun-ji go by herself? She's going into grade 1 soon. Of course she can. Eun-ji! Go with Grandma! Mom? Let's go to the bathroom. Eun-ji is smart like you, Jung-hee. Mom! Are you done Grandma? Grandma! Mom! She's not there. Really? She wasn't there either. Where did she go? I'll go look around down there. - Scatter out and find her. - Okay. - Mother! - Mom! Grandma! - Mother! - Mom! It's all because of me. If we didn't go to the bathroom... Grandma! Eun-ji, it's not your fault. Grandma will be back soon. Stop crying. There. Let's go. Where is she? Why are they dirty? What's this? What bastard did this? Jin-soo! Come here! What son of a bitch did this? Wait. What's this? Why am I doing this? What happened to your car? Go inside. Who did this to your car? Go in! Go back inside! Mother! No! It's hot! Jin-sook loves warm milk. Let's go inside. Come back here, bitch! Mother! Please! I'm not your mother! You're not Jin-sook! Go away! I'm sleeping with Jin-sook! Grandma! Stop it! Get up. Stop, bitch! Mother! Please stop! Jin-soo! Jin-soo! Help! Please, Mom! Mom! Stop! Dad! Stop her! Mom... I don't believe this! Are you okay? Mom! Dad! Is it the brakes or your foot that is the problem? If you won't give it to me, just scrap the car. It's so old. If it's old and broken, you scrap it? Just replace the old parts with the new. If it breaks, you fix it! It It breaks again, fix it again! What do you know? Forget it! I'll get it fixed in Seoul. Why do I come to this crazy fool! Nam-bong! You can't go like this! Bear with her. What? Then what about Eun-ji? She could've been injured! I can't live like this anymore! Send Mother back to the nursing home or hire a caregiver. I'll be staying at my mom's with Eun-ji. Come on! I'm sorry. Are you okay? Cho Jin-soo. You can't even support yourself. Don't act like a good son. Smarten up, will you? How could you say that? I'm your husband! How can you call yourself a husband? You're bleeding your parents and your wife dry! Shit! Like father like son in hitting wives? Mom... Get up, Eun-ji. Where are we going? To my mom's house. Hurry. Dad? Honey... Hurry. Grandma! Jung-hee... I'm sorry, Mother. Grandma... Let's go. - Mom! - Let's go! Get inside. The bus terminal, please. - Mom! - What? It's Grandpa. What? Father! Oh my... Why are you here, Father? You're the one who hopped on. To the terminal, right? Why not go in the morning. Your mom will be shocked. I'm sorry, Father. Why should you be sorry? If it was me, I would've left long ago. Struggling in-laws and a jobless husband... Father... It's not that. Don't come back. Stay there. No one will think badly of you. Just worried about Eun-ji... How is your hand? It's fine. Jung-hee... Yes? It's nothing. Why sit there? Get in. Jung-hee took Eun-ji to her mom's. Of course she wants to leave. Jung-hee may seem cold, but she's smart. Still, it's sad to see her go. What's that? Look at this. What is it? This is you, isn't it? I don't remember doing that at all. Is dementia contagious? Don't be stupid. It's not contagious like a cold. Did you see a doctor? Yes. Time is up for this car and me. Did you drink? A bit. Mom? Your memory is back? Do you know who I am? My son, Jin-soo. Are you okay? It's nice to hear you say my name. Your family is more important than parents. Go to them tomorrow. Mom... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. My poor mom... I called you many times! Why didn't you call me back? You missed me that much? How about a picture together? Crazy old fool. You couldn't get the car fixed in Seoul either, huh? I don't remember. Stop asking. Where's Kim? Drinking up a storm at home. They say if the wife dies, the husband will soon follow. What's with you these days? You look so weak. I'm fine. Here you go! I'm retiring. Take good care of it. What? You're not driving this? I'm going on vacation. Stop calling me. It's annoying to take calls. See ya! He's serious? What are you eating? Jin-soo bought this before he left. How thoughtful of the fool. He may become a professor soon. What stupid school would hire him? CALL IF YOU NEED ME, JIN-SOO What's this? He says to call if anything happens. What? You read this? Jin-soo told me before going! Of course... Don't act big because you can read. Jeez. It's nice and quiet. Not one, but two? If we both lose our minds, it'll be a sight! I guess two are better than one. It won't be boring. Don't just sit there! Go hang the laundry. Are you crazy? Make lunch! I'm hungry. Why are you laughing? You've changed! Maybe I should've gotten sick a long time ago! How can you say that? Fine! I'm sorry! I was just kidding. Stop mumbling and grab this! Get it straight! Like this? Aren't you scared? I was at first. But I'm fine thinking that what must come has come. Why? Are you scared? Me? Of course not. Good for you. Look. You pretend to go nuts and swear again, I'll break your legs! Hearing that makes me laugh. I can't believe I did that. Wanna starve me to death? Go down and make dinner! Has she really gone senile? Come back here! Good. I'm not a goat. What is this You don't like meat. Eat the anchovies and the pollack roe you like. Oops! I forgot it. I'll get it. Start eating. So forgetful... Let's just eat. It's salty. Don't eat too much. Why? Want a fried egg or something? I want chicken! You don't even like chicken. Have some water. I want chicken now! It you eat this, I'll buy you some later. Open wide. Is it good? What is it? - Pee-pee! - What's wrong? - Pee-pee! - Wait! It's okay. It's all right. Sir? Where was your taxi? Right here! Why are you out here? What's going on? He reported his taxi was stolen. I'm sorry. He sold his taxi. My taxi is gone! Someone ran off with it! Let's go in. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. My taxi... - Take care! - Thank you. The key is inside the vanity. Don't go out at night. Smart, Lee Mae-ja! You're smarter than I thought. Thank you. Eighteen! Swear all you want, but keep writing. Write everything you want to say when your memory is back Okay? Do you understand me? You have no clue, right? Damn. LEE MAE-JA (AGE 71) DEMENTIA PATIENT. CALL 911. Vroom! Vroom! Where are we going? Wherever you want to go, ma'am! Then let's take Jin-sook to the sea! Then let's take your daughter and go to the sea! Go faster! Let's go! Your hair is long. Get a haircut. You cut it at Mae-ja's Salon. It you keep moving, I won't cut it. Make sure you eat. I will. You too. Mae-ja? Are you okay? Answer me. Stop it! Come to your senses! Mae-ja, please stay focused. Hold on to your memories! Please? You're all I have. You can't die first. Answer me, please! MAE-JA, DON'T DIE FIRST. I'M SORRY. My precious... One, two, three! Cheese! Mom? It's a video. What? Oops! There you are! Please eat, Mother. No! Mother! No! Please stop! Mother... Mom! Who are you? Mom? It's me, Jin-soo. Who are you? - I'm your son. - Stay away! My head! My head! What's that noise? My stomach hurts! Where is she? What's wrong Where does it hurt? My tummy! Mae-ja! Snap to it! What's wrong? With honking behind me and fog up ahead, I just kept going down one road. But there wasn't a paved road for me. I tried my best to get on the paved road, but all I saw were rocks. Still, if I kept going hard, I thought life would reward me Now, even life throws a wrench! Damn It. Feel better complaining like that? What? You're back? It hurts. Sorry. I tried to get some sleep, but you kept grumbling. Hold on. I'll call the doctor. Don't bother. Sit down. Are you okay? Why weren't you nice like this before? How long was I here like this? Not long. You look pretty good. Me? I'm totally fine. How long do I have left? Don't say stuff like that! You're not going anywhere. Scoot over. I'm dying here. Anything you wanted to say to me? Like what? Good to have you. It's good to have you too. I wanted to tell you so much when you're back to normal. But now that I see you, I can't remember. Remember when you asked me what my dream was? Back when we were young, you asked about my dream in life. When you tried to pick me up? I didn't come on to you first. You followed me around! You said your dream was to provide for your wife and kids and be a good, trusty husband. Remember? I never said that. You can live well without me, right? Forget it. Don't say that in your right mind. Get some rest instead. What? Is there something on my face? I'm hungry. Get me some milk and bread? Sure. Wanna go for a walk together? Just go. Okay. I'll be right back. Stay focused, okay? It's me. Hi. Eun-ji was looking for her phone. Just leave it in my room. How are you? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I just wanted to hear your voice, son. How's Jung-hee and Eun-ji? Good. Wanna talk to Eun-ji? It's okay. Son. Yes? Be good to your father. Did something happen, Mom? Remember when I said I'll reply if I learned to read and write? You worked hard taking Jin-soo and me through the rocky roads. I was always thankful for you. And I'm sorry I ruined your dream. One will be better than two. If we meet again, let's live happily then, Nam-bong. Ma'am? Are you all right? Clear the way! Dear! What's wrong! She tried to commit suicide! Call emergency to prepare the defibrillator! Yes! Still, two are better than one. It won't be boring. I told Mom to leave this at home. Why bring it here? She called you? Yes, last night... Did something happen? Of course not. She probably missed your voice. How's Eun-ji? She misses her grandma. I see. How's Jung-hee? What about the baby? They're both doing well. That's good to hear. How about you? Me? I'm doing fine too. How do you pass your time these days? Playing cell phone games? I play games, go fishing and stuff. After years of schooling, people work hard to find jobs and you play games and fish? Pathetic fool... You're the head of a household. Shouldn't you lead a productive life now? Dad... Did you lead a productive life? If you just earn money, that's being productive? I caught lots of fish. We ate it together as a family and had fun. I think I did something productive as the head of household. That's not taking care of your family, but providing one meal. Yes, I'm pathetic! Still, I refuse to live like you. What about how I lived? I worked hard all my life. I didn't earn money like that, would you have eaten at all? Did you ever buy Mom and I cake on our birthdays? I don't remember having cake at home at all. Let's go. I'll buy you cake now. Why'd you come here today? Now that Mom's sick, you feel a bit guilty? Did you reflect on yourself? I resented you a lot. If that's how you feel... Let's drop it. Why did I have to feel guilty because of a sister I never knew? It's your painful past. Why did I have to suffer for your painful memory? Though your life's in the gutters, why did I have to live there too? Because you're my son. Though you may not like it. Mom told me to be good to you... I'm sorry. I'd better go. Fine. Go on. Drive safely back. Jin-soo! Yes? Is fishing fun? Don't try so hard. Let's go someday. He only came to give Eun-ji's phone? Did he say anything else? No. Probably came to make me feel bad because it's hard with Mom. Let's go back. We should help take care of Mother. Why did he bring her back from the nursing home! No! Let Dad suffer this time! That's not right. Daddy! Did you pee? - Daddy. - Hmm? When can we go see Grandma? We're not. You miss Grandma, Eun-ji? Yes! I promised I'll teach her English. Really? That's great! Let's go see Grandma and Grandpa! Yay! No, we're not! I said I'm not going! Let's go. I'm not going! Hi! Did you book a time with that professor? Oh... He's awake? That's great. It's okay. Thanks for trying. I'll buy drinks next time. I'm sorry to take it back. I knew you'd be back. How much is it? You'll pay for a birthday gift? What birthday gift? You missed your car's birthday. Kim pitched in his trip money and I did the rest to fix it up. Older and wiser, huh? Hold on! Kim said to give you this. I got sunglasses. How grateful. When you come, I'll cut the roof up nicely. Why cut up the roof? Then cut your home's roof, why don't you? Whatever! You don't know how good it is. I'm going. Make sure you bring gifts! Same shirts! So pretty! You like it? Yes! I love it! Where are we going? A trip. You love going on trips. Really? I love trips! I can't wait! Let's go! Right. Let's go on a trip. It hurts. Where? My head and tummy. Does it hurt a lot? No, I'm fine. I'll make the pain stop soon. Really? Yes. Get some sleep till we get there. Thanks for everything, Mae-ja. Is there a fire? Damn. Damn. What is it? You were speeding, Sir. You also don't have your seatbelts on. Your license, please. I'm in a rush. Bang! Bang! Bang! Wanna go and die with us? Verify a license, please? Thanks. Thank you. Sir? Your seatbelt. Enjoy your trip! How'd you know we're going to die? Grandma! Mother? We're here! Mom! Dad! Mother? Mother! Mom? Jin-soo! Look! Mom... Oh no... BANK BOOK MY DOCTOR SON Hello? 911? My mom and dad... My mom and dad... Please find my parents. It's nice to see the sea before going. I should've listened to Chun and cut up the ceiling. Lee Mae-ja... Living this long, we were punished enough, right? I really wanted to see this again... When did you come out? Are you hungry? What's wrong? What's the matter? What are you doing? Wake up! Lee Mae-ja! Please wake up! Dear! Open your eyes! Lee Mae-ja! Open your eyes! I have something to say! Open your eyes! Mae-ja... I was wrong. I'm sorry I made you work hard and yelled at you for life. I'm so sorry. Now, let's go and meet Jin-sook and enjoy life together in heaven. ROMANG Mae-ja? What is your dream? My dream? You know, like a dream in life? Anything you want to achieve? You tell me first, Nam-bong. What is your dream? Me? I want to make a lot of money and provide for my wife and kids. I want to take good care of them for life. What about you, Mae-ja? Well, my wish is... to have kids, take care of them, and grow old happily together with a good husband.
