[STRING MUSIC] [RECORD CRACKLES] [TONE HUMS] [RHYTHMIC MUSIC] [WIND BLOWS] NARRATOR: The sun rose upon a young, barren earth. Slowly, vast and profound changes occurred. Water vapor, heated by the sun, formed clouds, condensed, and fell to Earth, creating the oceans. The heat of the sun produced the winds and currents, and life began its evolutionary journey. [ORCHESTRA MUSIC] Plant life, using the sun to create oxygen, made possible animal life, and eventually, man. How was primitive man to deal with the power that controlled his life? Power that could provide or deny. [ELECTRICAL HUMMING] Fear turned into worship. Some created rituals to ensure the sun's return. Some sacrificed to the sun. Others used the sun to plan their planting and harvests and used its changing orbit to warm their dwellings in the winter and cool them in the summer. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] And the more he learned, the less he feared. And knowledge only increased his awe. [FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH] Meanwhile, underground lay a vast store of the sun's energy, trapped, waiting.

He's a little white dog with a black spot. - [OMINOUS MUSIC] - [WAVES] BOY: The sun feels good on your skin. You know, when you're wet and cold and it dries you and warms you up. WOMAN: When mama did the wash, we'd hang the clothes on the line and when we took them down, I remember how warm they felt and the fresh smell. It was wonderful. MAN: And with an early spring we had plenty of sun that year and everything grew. We're still eating the preserves Alice put up. MAN: In those days we built our houses of adobe. First the adobe, a little straw, and the sun did the rest. Of course you have to be careful of the straw, otherwise... MAN: We have a solid north wall and with the south end of the house open to the sun, you really won't need a backup system because the orientation of the house... MAN: Have your power sources, son, watering trays colored black to absorb heat, glass goes on top, traps heat, and that's called a solar collector and then you pump the hot water to any part of the house. WOMAN: That more than a quarter of our energy is used for heating space and water. So solving those requirements gets us a good part of the way. MAN: One thing about solar energy I like, it sure is clean and that's important when you read about... MAN: You're doing something about it, you're not at the mercy of those foreign oil producers. Well not as much, anyway. MAN: I've often thought that one of the good things about solar energy is it's pollution free, which is significant. MAN: If you stop and think about it, you realize that the sun doesn't send you a bill each month. Over the years, that's... WOMAN: The fact that solar is accident free goes a long way toward reassuring us that we won't be faced... MAN: With solar you worry less about terrorists and other people who use violence to achieve their aims. MAN: And my astronomy professor says the sun will always be there, at least for another several billion years or so. MAN: Actually, one of the most important solar energy developments involves photovoltaic cells. That's getting direct electricity from the sun. In five years, it'll be competitive to the stuff you buy when you turn on your lights. [DINGS] [MELODIC MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [RECORD CRACKLES]
