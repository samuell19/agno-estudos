This is a fansub done for free This should not be sold or paid for What a bad karma. But is it my karma, or your karma? When I abuse a woman, I can see her many faces. We all tormented frogs when we were young But... nothing is more fun than toying with a living human. BEAUTY'S EXOTIC DANCE TORTURE Be strong. This is good for you. It will help you recover This might be even tougher than any torture you've endured. Hello, mister... I can warm you up, sir. And you...? The recession doesn't give you an excuse for being fooled. That's really true. Come on. Closing time.. All of you. Be careful Don't trip on the step Come back and see us... Hey, closing time, sir Here's some water. All right... your wife is waiting for you You have no wife? She found a lover, and ran away with him Not once. But twice. What a spoiled woman. She should be happy with a husband. The second time, she made plans while I was in jail for 10 days. Why were you in jail? I cut my wife's toe. I was going to cut off her fingers one by one I wanted to make her stay home Then she wouldn't be able to meet another man. Splashed the acid over her skin I tattooed my name in that area Still I didn't feel confident, so I branded my name on her skin. I guess her man was truly in love with her That's why she could endure the pain They are such a happy couple. The story isn't about you? This man was a carpenter living above the butcher Seikichi Oguchi, 28 years old The woman was Yone Yahagi, 30... his common law wife Today is the Showa era... this story is from Taisho Period They are happily in heaven now. You got me! You should have listened well... Nobody is released from jail after 10 days for killing a wife Anyway he was out of jail, then sent back for something else. I don't understand the government at all. So why were you really in jail? I just did something that makes people happy. song about a soldier sent to Indonesia Hey!... Shut up! Hey... You! Show me the place you used for business. The place where prostitutes and models make money. Eh? Officers... please show respect to this young lady. We are conducting our investigation professionally. Enter! You are Mr Seyu... Oh... the pervert painter. You have earned a lot of money, invite us to the Hakone Resort. Should I get an autograph, What did she do? Charged with prostitution Why don't you come over here and tell us funny stories... ...about model agencies. - Right Regarding your wife... She asked me to arbitrate... she wants to marry your student I turned her down though. I can do nothing about people in love. Tell him I will give her away in nice wrapping paper. Hey, Shimaoka! You don't have luck with a wife, and I'm not lucky with husbands. I felt I would get involved with you in some way. - She looks frozen. - What? Bamboo sandals don't work in the snow. Terrible day... the train won't operate today And all the wagons are full Virtually she's walking in bare feet. Her toe nails must have changed color. I used to work at the brothel in Hokuriku, by the shore Every time I see snow, I remember those days. I guess I don't deserve a decent married life anymore. How about a couple... two people without luck in marriage? Are you going to brand your name on my skin? I might. You're kidding. But you seem so tender. You never know As a matter of fact, I've been trying to resist tying you up I wonder how beautiful you'd be in a rope torture. You are an unusual man. What are you doing? Stop this joke. Are you serious? Tell the truth! You have a good face for SM art. Untie me. Haven't you had enough? Did you do the same thing to your ex-wife? Didn't you? Yes... you did You were even nastier with her, weren't you? There are tips for bondage. I learned the techniques I studied an old book on discipline And I also had the chance to listen to retired detectives ... from the inquisition days They have secret techniques based on the type of torture In the Tokugawa Era, hanging torture demanded that the victim... ... must be hanging 4 inches from the floor At brothels, whores would hang so toes slightly touch floor. During torture, a couple must have a serious attitude. How is it up there? Pass me that plate. Tomei... -Yes?- Give it a test pull. - What do you think? - Seems to be strong. - Here... have some refreshment. - Thank you very much... Good afternoon... - Please come in. - Oh, good. What do you want me to do with my hair? - Eh?- You've got something in your mind Let me do your hair. Don't say anything about this to your doctor. Not Yet! Right now! Take her down. Immediately! Hey... 30 minutes! Very good. Now cover her with the snow. Shoot. Next we're going to crack the ice and put her inside Check the pond for a spot. Sir... this is out of control. The pond may be too deep Besides, her body can't endure it. Don't be absurd. She can hold on to a post in the ice. Women are strong. Of course, this depends on the individual if she is tense, she could stay naked in the snow for an hour. As soon as I find the right woman, I won't let her go I have an intuition towards understanding women sensitivity Plus the analysis by "one" Yeah... ask her to write the symbol for #1 let her use a brush instead of a pencil. She must use a brush with black ink on white paper This will tell you about her family background This test never fails. I have tested how a Shimada hairstyle falls apart I discovered how long it will hold form The process of Shimada style is secure with at least 10 ties It is very time consuming work But if tied securely, the stronger desire won't destroy it. Odd... but that's man nature. Then he wants to tie it again. You did this with your ex-wife, too. I did even more. Couldn't you get satisfied? Your logic is most adorable. It's much tougher than it seems When she's tired, she can't tiptoe any longer Then, when she relaxes her toes, her hair is yanked It's an awful trick. Absolutely You are worth torturing. You can't hold it any longer? Want me to untie you? Ask me... ask me to untie you. Or I could leave you like this, and enjoy your embarrassment. If you'd like. So you want to play to the limit? You have warm skin What's living inside your body? Quite a snowfall. What a nice snow. Yeah... quite a snow. It may have been such a day when you tortured your ex-wife. Do it to me... like you did with her. Are you serious? I won't stop after you begin... sad lullaby Hey...

Tae's sister is the mistress of the local prosecutor He can drag you through an interrogation Tae... I am in deep shit I thought a woman was to be used The hotter the horseradish, the more you cry for it. I thought a wife was something like a secretary or a whore But in my case, a wife is nothing but trouble She is insane The doctor gave up on her, but I can't afford the hospital bill I couldn't afford it if there was a cure Can you tie her up and hang her again? The shock might reverse her insanity I think she may be possessed by animal spirits. inherited in her mother's womb... Tae... Tae... Tae? ...Tae? Tae... Tae... where have you been? - I went to fetch tofu. - Tofu? I've been craving it. here's your change. Don't worry... I counted the change first. You're getting better You can count again?
