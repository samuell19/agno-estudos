These actions happened in real life. For the safety of those still alive, some details have been changed. The Polish mafia hurt a lot of people, everybody knows that. But have you ever wondered how many people have hurt the Polish mafia? In my opinion, just one. It was Biggie Big. He hurt a lot of decent thugs with tales out of his fat ass. As he was the first one who started snitching on his friends, everybody believed in his lies but the real truth about gangsters... PRESENT DAY …looks totally different. Ladies and gentlemen, I have received information that… Yes, there he is. That's him. The third part of your saga begins with a poetic description: half a ton of cocaine which you burnt, so it doesn't come onto the Polish market. Yes, I really wanted to save from drugs, especially, the youngest generation. I was born in the shithole called Polish People's Republic. Frankly speaking, in order to become a gangster you don't need to grow up in a fucked up family. I had a place to live and to sleep. I had loving parents and a great sister. I really don't know, how a prick like me happened to be in this family. We cannot lose this match, Portuguese, Alves, Chalana but Kasperczak takes the ball and passes to Lato… They've brought coal. A lot of loses, left side, Poland attacks... They've brought coal! Just in time. Cross and Szarmach. But he doesn't reach the ball as Umberto heads it behind the line, so we have a corner and this time, instead of Henryk Kasperczak Kazimierz Deyna is running towards the corner. The crowd is booing. Deyna, a short run-up, center. No! It was a direct shot. Gabriel misses, Bento is hopeless, goal! Goal! Kazimierz Deyna scores directly from the corner. Poland is leading in Chorzów against Portugal 1:0. Incredible emotions as this means we are going to Argentina for the World Cup. How did that happen? It's a tomato soup. It's still there. And this one? - Oh. - Where did you get it? We were running around with Laura and I hit the door. Yep. He hit so hard it almost fell off its hinges. And I thought you had a fight again. No way, Dad. It was delicious. Thanks, Mum. A good gangster always tells you a story you want to hear. For as long as I can remember, I fought against anyone. I had a few fights a day. On the playground I learned what today they call MMA, krav maga or some other shit. When you enter a fight, always act like a loser and when the idiot believes it, you begin your own game. You too will get your ass kicked one day. I am shocked. - Your son is a little hit man. - Little? You will regret that. I would like to kindly ask you not to take any actions. My son is a little lost but… He is a good boy. Skillful, intelligent, he doesn't steal. Let's call it… a final warning. Thank you very much, Mr. Principal. You see, son? Say thank you to Mr. Principal. Did you win, at least? I was ten years old. I had no idea who I was going to be but I promised myself I will never ever again let anyone catch me. As a little boy I used to love stealing my dad's cab. I didn't know the city so I drove the night bus route. Break! I saw them for the first time. Watch out. Get the fuck out! They weren't going to their jobs. They had money, whores, cars. They could fight as much as they wanted and no one could do anything about it. They are gangsters. Gangsters. I told myself that one day I will be one of them. Taxi? Solidarity, Wałęsa, Popiełuszko, martial law. I didn't give a shit about any of these. In the 80's, the state was mafia. This is where the biggest scams happened. If you wanted to make money you had to cooperate. With the authorities' permission Nikoś stole cars in Western Germany. Barabasz robbed trucks, Malizna dealt with currency, Słowik handled burglaries and Pershing opened casinos. Little wise guys were becoming serious gangsters. I wanted to be like them. I was a skinny youngster, but I looked mature for my age. The first idea for business came to me from one lovely girl… Dorotka. Since she was little, her morality was shit, but she was loyal and hardworking. Probably that's why she became a member of parliament in the 90's. You were great. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Kind of a cunty line, I admit. - Whatever they say about you… - You've got cigs? There is my dad's box, take it. What would I want a box for? For this service I want an entire carton. A service? And you thought I came here with you for fun? Yeah. You're nice… but come on. Okay, a hundred is also fine. Listen, do you know other girls that so easily… You know… give themselves over for money? You mean, whore? - Yep. - Sure. My friend, sister, mum. I couldn't believe my own luck. I owe my very first gangster flash to this little whore. I think mum is not a good idea. It was a perfect business plan. I'm not saying I invented prostitution, but it only took connecting a few dots. Your ID. He is my son. Firstly, I had on hand a few simple ladies with low expectations towards the world. Secondly, my dad often drove rich Arabs who were looking for only one thing. - Welcome to Poland. - Lech Wałęsa. Oh yes. Where to? Women. Anal sex. Mister, it is a Catholic country. I will show you an anal sex. Get out. Please leave the car. Leave the taxi now. Lech Wałęsa. You cannot sit on a monument with your dirty arse. I will bloody show you anal sex. Dad wasn't open for different religions. I was. Especially for rich ones. I think I was the only kid in the city to give my dad pocket money back. So, you're welcome. I connected the dots and in one night I made more money than my dad in a month. What about her? Driver. Wait, I'll go. Wait. Dad was very concerned. The girls were happy because they earned a lot. The Arabs were happy because they had anal sex. But I was missing the adrenaline rush. Finally, thank God. Get off me! Son? Dear God. So this is how you make a living? Dad, he wanted to hit my friend. Nice to meet you. Ryszard. Go to the car. Dad. Okay, I'm off. Goodbye, mister. You're in deep shit. Should I take it? No way. Whores would snitch on me in no time. Give it back to Arabs and die from boredom? Thankfully, there was a third option. Gentlemen, thanks to you, a very important thing occurred to me. Whatever you do, don't do it for the money. Are we cool? Oh, one more thing. You can steal money, splash out you can wipe yourself with them. But there are things you cannot buy. Adrenaline, pride, feeling of strength, character, You were great. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Whatever they say about you, to me you're like brothers. It was the first time I saw this boy. In a few years he will become my best friend and I will have to shoot him in the back... but I'll talk about it later. Mafia is the strongest when the state is weak. In the 90's we treated the police like mentally disabled cousins The Old Pruszków and Pershing had an entire country in their pockets. Their captains: Kiełbasa, Bryndziak and the future laureate of Nobel prize in literature, Biggie Big. They were shaking Poland. Truck robberies, smuggling of spirit, cigarettes, cocaine, protection money, prostitutes, security. How on earth have I ended up here? Who really are these guys? It's too small. Fuck. What are we going to steal? Honey? Oh wait, I was supposed to begin this thread differently. One more time. The first capital of Poland was Gniezno, the second was Kraków, the third, Warsaw and the fourth capital… was Pruszków. And I was promoted to a caporegime. I had a crew of almost 30 people. They say that you make the best cappuccino in town? And my every soldier brought me a stack of cash once a week. Maggi can see him now. Maggi wants to see you. It's Maggi. - Wait, I'll search you. - I'm not packing. - Mariuszek. - Are you a fag or what? Oh fuck! Maggi. As cruel as he is sleazy and disgusting. He is also definitive and profit-minded. In the golden era of Pruszków one of the five managing directors. The king always fucks the queen. Do you think I buy these teddies in bulk? -He disrespected me -Disrespected my ass. He's doing his job. Hit other teddies, leave ours alone. Mariuszek is suffocating, take him away. I have an idea. Awesome ideas don't come to your head just like that. They most often come with someone's help. Listen, my brother works at the main post office. Cool, can we talk about it in 30 seconds? All right. Okay, talk. I'm all ears. Listen, he's worked at this post office for some time and he's all right and he gets it… The most often, a good idea comes with an exhibitor. It is a person who tells the gangster everything. …you'll tell him what you want, maybe you can work something out. In this case, it was a "Human Cunt." He's been preached by his mother, beaten by his friends and blown off by every girl. Human cunts snitched on Jews during World War II, in communism – on the opposition, and in the 90's they will snitch on their colleagues to feel important for even a brief moment. They live like cunts, they die like cunts. Exactly on the fourth day of every month, exactly at 11:00 a.m. One and a half million zloty in a suitcase. Salaries for all the post office employees in Warsaw. Five men, five guns. You are asking my permission? Yes I am. Twenty percent for you. Is there anyone going to take care of this bloody Mariuszek or not?! Boy, you are a striker, you are the one who bombs. And there goes my plan. But now is the time for the real Operation Arsenal. All right. Thank God, long live Pruszków mafia. But… Oh hell no, what do you mean "but"? …the operation will be led by Crowbar. If everything goes well we will think about the future. You know why Maggi is called Maggi? Because whatever you might cook, if you add Maggi, even the most delicious meal becomes tasteless. This fucker added this shit to everything. You've probably heard or read in criminal records a sentence like "The victim was killed with a dull tool" and you must have wondered what the hell is that. Well, Crowbar is a dull tool. He freezes for a week when you ask him what's two plus two. This idiot was supposed to lead my Operation Arsenal: subtle, precise, discreet. Hey mate, I've heard there is some job to be done. Subtle, precise, discreet. I'm Crowbar and this is young Crowbar, Little Tool. You're a tool? Little Tool, not a tool. You have something for me? What's your weight class? Which cunt sold it to you? The only thing you should be interested in is ten percent for the cunt. Maybe write special greeting under our ID numbers for Mrs. Prosecutor. The bigger the idiot with writing problems the more he wants to write down. How do you spell "my"? Exactly like Biggie Big. With a dot. Marian, take someone from the city and get the car. Mariuszek, check out the location. And you… go pick up the guns from Blat. Blat is like a brother to me. He got me a gun to whack Skinny from Wawer. - You whacked him? - Of course it was me. He was begging for mercy on his knees. Squealing like a pig. Nice. Yeah right, you dickhead. Skinny was two metres tall and he was whacked by Nuthead's sidekick while he was sleeping. But I appreciate the info that I cannot trust you. Don't be scared. They drank a little and they shoot cans. Tool, what the hell are you doing? Little Tool. I came to pick up the guns from Blat. From a drunk guy with his friends around? Yep. Welcome to the 90's. Maybe you should also tell them what we need the guns for? I have already done it while ordering. They will be cheering for us. It was a Crowbar's order. I'll wait in the car. Hey, don't be a pussy. Whatever, I'll be there in half an hour. I'll eat some sausage. Some people channel their stress at work by watching matches on TV. Unfortunately, I don't care about football. I need to channel my stress differently. It is a type of sport competition. You were great. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Whatever they say about you, you are like brothers to me. Respect. How on earth I ended up in here? Who really are these guys? Fuck. When you are in the middle of a heist that was your idea, when you are holding a gun, when there is two million zloty in a suitcase, then, 20 seconds is a bloody long time. What was I thinking at this moment? I saw things I had messed up. I'm taking part in a heist that was organized by a complete moron. Did the moron plan it well? I don't know. I left this matter in the hands of chance. Weapon sorted during a barbecue. Do I know its' origin? Maybe someone was killed with it. I don't know. I left this matter in the hands of chance. Who is this man? Is he a scout straight after a camp or a former commando who will kill us all? I don't know, I didn't check. There is money inside, but is it only money? Maybe there is paint that will explode or a radio transmitter? I have no bloody clue. What is this guy going to do? Will he focus on the job or will he hate me for breaking his nose? How many cameras are recording us? How many policemen coming back from work are in the cars around us? Is there a digger blocking our way out? I don't know, I didn't check. - I can buy you whatever you like. - Did you have real guns? Come to my room and I'll show you my gun. You have condoms? - It's fine, I'll give you a hand job. - Seriously? And you think that he shot himself in the back? - And what about Fatty? - Laying. - What about this tough guy from Tarchomin? - Laying. Where is vodka? Laying. For a man who led the heist of the century! Why aren't you celebrating? You deserve it. I'm still young, but I think that if someone robbed something he shouldn't go out and shout about doing it, right? Mariuszek. Wait. Are you with this crew? Do you remember the boy on the bike? That's the guy. And who are you? They call me Walden. If there is a chance to make some money, I'm interested. Do you want to be like them? Rather like you. Police, on the ground! Look at him. He's searching my naked legs. Who is more scared now? The funny thing is, I wasn't arrested for the heist but for puncturing a lung of that Polonia hooligan. In the meantime, the heist crew had so much fun for next couple of months the entire Warsaw heard them. They were catching them one by one. There were 32 names on the indictment act. The police were browsing the Crowbar's notes and knocking on every door one by one. Even his mother was locked as they hid the guns at her place Thirty-two people. Crowbar: 13 years. Maggi: 15 years. Little Crowbar: seven years. Marian: seven years. The rest got three to four years. I was up for something different so I had to wait longer for my sentence. In the meantime the Polonia hooligan showed some balls and they found me innocent. The time I served in arrest was counted as the one for the heist. I was free after one year and a half. Yes, I know, I was bloody lucky. In the meantime, police took everything I owned and I had to start from a scratch. I faced the fact that one year and a half is enough. I won't come back behind bars. I won't be the way other gangsters are. I won't be an idiot. Since now I do everything on my account and the way I like it. I'll tell you a story how I joined a group of the most influential thugs in this crazy country. In the mid 90's the idyll was over but it wasn't the police that killed Kiełbasa. The police didn't kill Nuthead, Nikoś, Pershing and dozens other thugs. The police didn't shoot in Gama. The Polish mafia had it all and ruined everything. At their own will. The most important question: who you can trust? It was found in a ditch with three other puppies. The others were quickly taken, nobody seems to like this one. Who would rather go to jail than to snitch while facing a five-year sentence? Money doesn't matter because there will always be someone who outbids you. The trust can only be built on affection. Save a puppy from the ditch, and he will be faithful until the rest of his life. For now I have a tracksuit. When I make money, I'll be like you. Can I call you "Chief"? Give me all you've got. Sit down. Sit the hell down. Let my friend, I'll let yours. I'll rip him apart! He's bloody good. Welcome to the team, son. Can I get up already? Am I safe now? There is no shame in getting a beating. Shameful is to leave your friend behind. There is a French saying. It doesn't matter who you begin with, It only matters who you end up with. I've created my own criminal group. Different from others. Only a couple of the most trusted people have access to me. Even if each of them has 30 soldiers I never see them. I give all orders face to face. The groups have no idea about each other's existence. Biggie Big ended the Polish mafia because everybody knew about everything. Damn. Chief, is that true you smashed five hooligans? - It's true, and 15 Arabs. - How many? Facts don't matter, the legend needs to be alive. I've found Malczewski's Narcisisst. It is a girl. Did you know? I know a lot of things or I don't. There is no shame in not knowing. The thing is to know your boundaries and pick your team in a way it doesn't have weak points. Krater is a cold-blooded motherfucker. Precise technician. Gollum isn't the wisest. He comes in first and takes on the chin an owner with a knife or a guard dog. And there is Tysiek. It's clean. He can make anyone laugh. Sometimes to death. Never mind. We have our order. Malczewski's Narcissist. You're right, a girl. Chief, - should we take it as well? - Do you have a buyer for that? - No. - Steal only the things you can sell. All right we have it. Let's go. We only had to follow a couple of rules. We aren't looking for attention, We steal only from the wealthy ones, We don't touch women and kids. The entire world is ours. These two kinds are important: artificial and natural. However, pre-sowing fertilization of the garden soil means inserting the fertilizer into the soil before you sow the plants with the usage of a plow, or a harrow. The guy was talking about soil fertilization and I for the first time couldn't take my eyes of a girl. I liked everything about her. Eyes, hair, the way she bites her pen. I will repeat. What the hell? Can we decrease level of soil degradation thanks to natural fertilization? Yes. Because we have no limits. The only limits we have are the ones we create. It's a bold thesis. Remember that while fertilizing the soil the most important is to feel limitless. Hey mate. Tool. Little Tool, goddammit. Long time no see. I haven't seen you for so long, How is your life? People say you do some crazy stuff. - Your sentence was seven years, right? - Yep. And it's been only three. There was an amnesia and they legally let me go earlier. Amnesia? Amnesia. Would you have some job for me? Some stuff to move? - You snitched. - Are you out of your mind? Listen, I know you didn't snitch on me so I won't whack you. Man… Look at you. You're trash. Thank you. Here you go. I don't know, these girls are too pretty. Come on, Chief. Your friend is having another break down and he asked me to keep you company. -Hello -What the hell you're doing? I didn't expect that while irritated you too will act like a peasant. - What the hell are you saying? - Nothing. - Listen to me… - No, you better listen to me. Please, don't lower the level of this conversation to the playground where you got beaten your entire life. And I come to your world, where you can be someone who you definitely are not so sit down and forget about her. You don't know how much you owe me right now. She's way out of your league, Kevin. My name is Adam. Exactly, that's great. So get the hell out of here, Adaś. He's not my friend. He was simply… - Hitting on me. - So now we know how not to do it. What else a guy who cares about you shouldn't do? But he really cares? First of all, he shouldn't think I'm easy and he could take me to bed on the first date. Who? The one who cares. He definitely doesn't care about a girl willing to go to bed on the first date. And on the second? Third? Whenever we cannot control ourselves any longer. We? The guy who really cares about me shouldn't act like someone he's not. Would you like to be a cheater's girlfriend? This is me. You're old, but I like your name. It's a bold move for the first date. So it is a date after all? Not really, but if it was, it would be a very bold move. - What can I do to make it a date? - We would have to know each other better. People know each other while dating. Yes, but before they go on a date they know at least something. - It's much safer. - What would you like to know? - What do you do for a living? - And you? I have to feel safe as well. I study garden design. You could take a look at mine? All right, so what's the occupation… of a single man. Who owns a house with a garden? Yeah, keep on lying, it'll work out great for you. I have a company. - What kind of company? - The one that raises funds. Tell me what funds have you raised recently then. First, I prepare the ground for my business partners. My people dazzle the potential investors with the vision of a high profit. And this is a living room. A good motivation is the most important. I've been looking for you on all floors. Come on! - Big money? - Only. Today I'm paying the deposit, and you hold the deal. A gift of persuasion plays. They are given the priority. Anyone can be allured. I'm impressed. Success is a state of mind. Which button should I press? When you achieve it the time comes to pay back the partners. What's your name? How do you do it? I'm off. See you tomorrow. Bye. Wait. You are probably in a hurry too. Tomorrow, you need to dazzle a few interlocutors. But what does that have to do with… Perfect alibi, tell people what they want to hear. But you should tell me what you really want to say. So? I have never been so stressed… by a conversation with another person. Okay. Anything else? And… I am a thief. - You know, I am… - That's fine with me. We are limitless. The only limits are the ones in our heads, right? Wait, are you…? I had a drink, come, walk me home. I told him to go to the brothel. She won't give you anyway. People, help me! Get off me! Get off me man. Finally, there came the right one for you, you dick! Thank you very much. - This is how you deal with arseholes. - Michał! Are you out of your mind?! What have you done, you idiot?! People, help me! - What? - I've never done it in a place like that. If you tell me only the truth we will have sex in a National Museum. Is it nice to ambush me in a place of living? I am trash? You've been on the top for a long time. Now you will know how to be on the bottom. Frankly speaking, my situation sucks. Have you studied this line all week? The only solution is to break through this wall of meat and run. When you are being hit by two people anyone can connect the kick. When you are being hit by six people, they kick each other and they interfere. But if they put me into this boot… I will never get out of it. Now or never. Use what you have on hand. We'll get over it as a couple, at least for some time. Fuck him up! This is how you build a fucking legend. In this city, in this country, nobody has the right to raise a hand on me. Yesterday's wolves became today's sheep. An entire city knew who I am looking for. And that I will never let him go. Where is Little Tool? Take the sausage. Help your friend out. Give me your finger. No, goddammit, no! Torturing is not enough. Each of my executioners received eternal shame and humiliation. If someone threatens our boss with a finger, he loses it. Where is Little Tool? I don't know! - Halo. - Hey, I was thinking I could come by tomorrow to your garden and see what can be done. To my garden? When do you want to come? Maybe Friday at 6,00 p.m.? Okay. I can't wait, bye. Bye. Everybody will benefit from that. You haven't eaten it all, have you? Welcome. However, the entrance is in the front. I have looked into the real estate market in this area. The experts value your house at one and a half million zloty. And I would like to offer you for the house and a beautiful garden double the amount… in cash. But you would have to move out in three days. Chicken soup? The history of Polish mafia has two chapters. The first, Golden Era, which is about to finish. And the second, which began from introducing an institution of a crown witness. The first Polish crown witness was Biggie Big. A thug who in order to save his fat ass snitched on a half of the Polish mafia. Friends, best friends, enemies and complete strangers. One dick got broken by the police and an entire Pruszków disappeared The ones who weren't killed in private bloodletting went to jail. The Old Pruszków got six and seven years. Hundreds of capos and soldiers went to jail. A big thug hole appeared in the middle of Poland. A hole to be filled by someone. Do you think they will like me? - Your parents? - It's not enough that I like you? Fuck. Merynos, quiet. Password? Biggie Big suck a dick. Come in. Chief, look what I have in here, brand new. Color screen, memory that holds ten photos. I already have five, a little gallery… Walden, my stepson. He commands 30 soldiers, he's my bumper. He's my main front guard that takes the first hit. And he's super excited about color screen. Discreet like they know me. Little Tool is in the Tricity. I promise, I will get him for you, boss. Take my old apartment. Settle down. No. And by the way, my parents think I work in a garage. Magdalena, what's your occupation? I'm starting my own landscape architecture bussiness. - Can you make a living by doing this? - I think yes, in some time. And you son, when are you finally going to make some money? And quit working in the garage? I'm looking for some new options, Dad. Listen… Take my cab. My health isn't good enough for it. 1700 zloty a month is a sure thing. For a month? It's an excellent idea, Dad. Cheers to you children. Rysiu, it's so nice of you that you gave him the car. He will finally make some money, and not in a garage. Magda is a smart girl, you know. My dad gave me the best idea ever. The cab became my group's mobile command center. I have been a taxi driver for two years and I have never driven a real customer. The car wasn't suspicious and fitted six people without a problem. Exactly six. Perfect. Walden is my right-hand man. He takes all the risk. He does the training of the rookies. He is good at it. The new guy, make him tell you where Little Tool is. Why me? He said we all are professionals but you are a pussy. Yes, it's really that easy. What was I supposed to ask him? - Who will explain that to me? - We are just having fun. We bet that he will enter this cold ass water. We could use a better reason to whack a cop. Come on gentlemen, let me go in there because I will make five hundred and if I freeze, I won't get anything. You better not catch a cold in here. What were the odds that the police will come here exactly at this moment? Zero. What were the odds that this guy shows a character and won't snitch on us even though the policemen could have saved his life? Zero. Thanks to his attitude he fooled his destiny. Get lost. This is why instead of disappearing in river he came back to his family business. He took over his dad's fishing boat. You can say that we saved his life. What are you looking at? Let's roll. One day, my perfect world started to fall apart. Hi. Smart, very smart. I tell my people the same thing. Think out of the box, weasel. But they are mostly idiots. Anyone who thinks is invisible, becomes an idiot. I have a thing, a big thing. I give an idea and an execution, you provide protection and your name. Half a million at stake. I am listening. So maybe… come to my place. Swimming pools on Inflandzka street. And you think you can get in my cab and I will take you wherever you like. Don't tell anybody. That was the first and the last real taxi ride in my life. I didn't charge him for it. We're here. Tell me, how much time do you need to fully recover? - Forty-five minutes. - Damn. Wait. Who this might be… at our door? Welcome to my humble kingdom, hakuna matata. You know I didn't mean to do it. Hole. Hey, homie. You can feel a bit confused, but I will explain you everything. The one kneeling is Ziko. The one next to him with a hole in his leg is Hole. A funny coincidence. Ziko… The more drunk he is, the more impatient he becomes. Ziko's dog tried to hump Hole's leg. And Hole said that Ziko's dog is a fag. Ziko doesn't like fags. Because they fucked him in jail and he's still disgusted. So he shot Hole. Ziko is his friend and now he's apologizing to him. And we all here are wondering what is Hole going to do first, bleed out or accept the apology. But he will definitely have to buy a new sofa as he messed up this one a lot. You won. Focus. Acid, start talking. Near Grodzisk, there is a guy with a chicken farm. He is filthy rich, we've been observing him. He's got a 14-year-old daughter. We kidnap her from school and later... That's enough. Let him finish. Children? I'm out. What's wrong about it? Marian, goddammit, I'm totally out. I'm not doing anything with them. Not with him. He has his head filled with dope. Am I supposed to talk with him? Am I supposed to believe he won't snitch on me? - You better watch out. - Shut the fuck up. In the morning they will be fine. You will see, let him at least finish. I haven't heard anything, I know nothing, I wasn't here. Hole, come on, stay alive, I was only joking. Hole… I was only joking. We will do it on our own. No. This dick is right. Maybe we could deal with them? What have you done to him? It was a good deal. For real. Walden, little boy, start your own group, and then do the deals like that. Until you're here, shut your front door and stop whining. Damn, they have a horse collar. They know how to play. I know they are crazy, but money is money. I may not know the difference between Van Gogh and Penderecki but I have already seen it. - We have stolen it once. - And we're doing it again. It will be a wedding gift for my fiancée. Chief, you haven't said anything! Bravo, this is how real men act. Congratulations, Chief. What's the date? - There will be the right time... - Guys, shouldn't we run? Young blood, we're running. Quickly, quickly. This day was special. Different from other days. - Can I? - Speak. Boss, the situation is… Damn, I exercise too much. It may be not the right time but come on. Come on, he's coming. All the best, Chief. - On the new path of your life. - All the best. All the best. At this moment I realized that this not exactly quick-witted boy is not only a soldier, not only a trustworthy man. They say anyone can start snitching. You cannot become a crown witness if you've killed a man. Would you like to enter into marriage freely without coercion? Did you want to kill me? - Yes. - Yes. I only wanted to scare you. I am begging you. That was your perfect plan? You see, I haven't come up with anything new. I'll kill you. Just like that. We all have gathered here to join this couple in a matrimony. This is why if we do it together... We will kill you. …and we won't know who was the one to kill each of us can be a murderer. I take you… Magda, to be my wife. I promise you love, faithfulness and marital honesty. Now never again, no friend will snitch on the other. …and that I will not leave you till death do us part. Receive this ring as a sign… - …of my love. - …and fidelity. - In the name of the Father… - …Holy Spirit. If there is anyone who is opposed to this marriage, speak now or forever hold your peace. What God has joined together, let no one separate. Amen. - What's that? - Nothing, I cut myself Let's go, the guests are waiting. - Are you having a good time, Love? - Violetta. Don't ask for survival, as you will only survive. If you want to have it all, don't ask for rain. Ask for a storm. I had a loving family, I had a crew ready to jump in fire with me, I had the best girl in the city, I had it all. If you wanted to be a gangster in 2004, you had to see a lot and know that silence and humbleness give you more chances to survive. That business is best done in small, trusty groups My people had a lot of work, but if they wanted they could work independently. Of course I had to know about it and they had to give me 30%. I remember months when my only job was to receive money people had to pay me. With love from the guys from the Tricity. There is a thing, and a question: can I deal with it on my own? Of course it is a thing that Chief doesn't even need to touch. I'll take some guys from the city and I'll be back in a week, okay? Of course 30% for the Chief. He got the idea, he explained it. He asked the question and he answered himself. I saw nothing, I heard nothing, I got 30%. You'd like that? - You're not afraid he will leave you? - No. How do you know? Because he is my man. And I am his, and we are... Come downstairs. If you cannot keep your people in check you are not a gangster material. In the name of the ones you didn't appreciate, you stopped their personal growth... - Ziko? - A total dumb-ass. First, what was he thinking? That the balaclava will change his voice? What are you doing? Acid sent you? Secondly, if you want to whack someone don't read him letters. I'm sorry, boss. We have to start our own group with the boys. Thirdly… Thirdly, check your gun before the execution. It may turn out that the bullets were flooded by vodka and due to moisture, they lost 90% of their power. He would hurt him more if he was throwing these bullets. Yes… that really happened. Don't shoot while you're drunk. Do you want to whack someone? Take the courage to look the victim in the eyes. Either the way, you won't fool your destiny. Chief! CRIME BOSS FOUND IN THE RIVER I will get a cold one from the car. Sometimes a line between being frank and being naive is so thin. He is nice, isn't he? He promised to take me on holidays to Turkey. It will be a nice year together. A year? And what next? Next, anything can happen. The things they do are dangerous, don't you think? What do they do? How much was it? And this wasn't cheap either. And it's from the cab driver's salary? No… the cab is only for dad. For dad? And the house… with a huge garden? Also from the cab driver's salary? For dad, I used to wear lace underwear. The others sacrifice the truth at the altar of love. - Hey, can I do her too? - Get lost. - Do you really have to? - Suck it. - Have to do what? - Attract attention. You're much milder than you used to be, Chief. Listen, goddammit, if I go to jail… I want it to be something big, not ADHD mixed with vodka, do you understand? Shall we? Mister, you cannot enter. - Let him in, he's a decent thug. - I'm talking to you. You cannot enter in sport shoes and your own booze. I won't throw away the shoes. Got them from my girlfriend. Let's call the boys and burn this shit down. Are they supposed to drive 400 km to fight for honor of your Nike? I don't know, in the past we would both fuck them up. I don't know, some calculations, humility. Fuck, where is the adrenaline? Yes. We are about to go home, but one more thing. Could you tie my friend's shoe? I don't want him to fall. Don't start with me. Listen… bow down, apologize, tie it and we will forget about it. Get the hell out of here. Why are you called Walden? My dad called me that, While beating me up in the meantime. But it's good. At least I'm a decent man now. He used to say that when everything calms down and everybody will leave him in peace he will travel to Walden Lake and he will be sitting and watching and he will be feeling at peace. And did he go there? Yep. He drank himself to death, but I got from him… A feeling of peace when I'm looking at water. You meant vodka. I promised myself… That everybody will run when they hear my nickname. And there I am, Walden. Walden! Fuck! Should I run now? Hallo. I'm listening. Who's calling? Yes. I'll be there. What's up? The new is coming. - What a beautiful forest. - Not all of them are ours. A half will be sold. To make it clear, I invested money from you in the company. You can spend the money on whatever you like. I don't want to be dependent on you. I will get a few more customers and then we will be able to have a baby. Good morning. Good morning. There are two types of thugs. The first is the one you would say: "This is exactly how I imagined him." Usually they are idiots. A thug looking like a thug. The real master of a camouflage. And the second type you would say: "I imagined him to be totally different." Do you like books? Daniel was exactly that type. The greatest after the fall of Pruszków. What have you read recently? - I am trying to read... - Take a seat. The place is safe. Nobody can see us, nobody can hear us. You can feel safe. I always take care of my safety. I was curious… That the more I wanted to know about you, the less I actually knew. I share your view that silence is good for business. I prefer the ones who don't talk when asked, to the ones talking without asking. It's really loud out there. Kidnappings for ransom. Is there a sillier way to attract attention? A group from Nowy Dwór. They pick up their guns more often than phones. The Gang of Loonies. Kill someone… because he said that your dog is gay. What's wrong with that? That a dog with another dog… In a doggy style. What's wrong with that? I think you're able, you have your ways. Would you be interested in a job to make the city a bit more… ANTIQUE SHOP That way, without any noise around it, I became a close partner of the most powerful gangster in Poland. I was making gigantic amount of money and nobody knew who I was and who I work for. I let Daniel rule the world and I had a perfect position. I always worked quietly. And by the way, totally unintentionally I freed this country from a couple of really nasty fuckers. Hey, Chief. - What's up? - You got yourself a front row seat. - The job is done. - Very well. - How do you like the apartment? - It's awesome, all the girls love it. - Who's next? - I don't know yet. Chief, I have to admit that I really like this job. For example, I am thinking while dealing drugs, you need to weigh the risk, you're afraid of the sentence, how many years for what you can get. And for the hits, in a way I'm not threatened by any of these because what is the difference that they will give me time for one or for one hundred. I will go to jail anyway, right? There is some logic in that. I want to create Commando Death. A secret group with a narrow specialization. That's my plan. Chief should blow this Danielek off. They say that he used to snitch in communism, that he works for cops. We can fuck up all these groups. Except the Loonies, they're cool. Oh, I'm going to watch how they seize trucks. Okay, I'm off. I've created a monster. Are you ready to accept Jesus to your heart? Get lost. Will you talk to a humble representative of the Central Investigation Bureau? If you had something, we wouldn't be talking. - You might be right. - So what's your deal? I'd like to meet someone who I can exchange information with. You should create an account on MySpace. Would you ever like to wake up without a thought like "they haven't got me yet"? What about your main person of letters Gallus Anonymus, he has nothing left? He only wants to publish more books. This idiot is not even able to make a shopping list. - Give me those who make the most noise. - What can you give me in exchange? We will chase you but without… a special engagement. Yeah, now you are super engaged. Give me those Loonies. The invisible hand will deal with them. Listen, maybe I could give you information about some people who shit all over the city but… It's against my hygiene. - Hygiene? - Yep, hygiene. Do you brush your teeth? You see, my routine is to do it twice a day. I don't know what I would do if one day while brushing my teeth, I would see a face of a scumbag which snitched on the others. I don't know. Maybe your person of letters can do it, maybe he doesn't mind, but not me. I don't collect business cards. I respect your work, let's continue chasing each other. Do you want to talk? Where were you? At work. Should we talk? Supper at 7,00 p.m. You better be hungry. The truth is what we are ready to accept as the truth. I will be. Two things, first of all… Gang of Loonies, they are insane idiots, they need to disappear. Secondly, in some time there will be a shipment, there will be exactly 500 kilos of it. If you pass the test, you will take part in dividing the cake. And after that, I will rest in peace. What about all of it? Shocking news from our criminal office. According to the first, unconfirmed information in Olszanka near Warsaw police found two stolen trucks. While securing the area, an unidentified group of criminals tried to get back the stolen equipment. A shootout broke out. Two policemen were killed on the scene. While escaping, the criminals kidnapped a six-year-old boy. The boy's body was found two hours later in Żerań. And now it's time for sport news by Karol Bukawski. Gang of Loonies. A promising talent, Kamil Stoch is on the ski jump. What's up, boy? Good beginning. Unfortunately only 61 meters. And he shits himself at the very start. Leave him alone. He's a good boy, he will be a good jumper, you will see. And we have another jumper ready, from Germany this time. I'm sorry boss, we didn't have any other place. - To the kitchen. - Go. - Who is he? - He's a doctor, the new guy's brother. Get the hell out of here. You do your job. Damn, why there is so much ketchup? What happened there? Damn, Chief, I was only watching. This goddamn cop. He was securing the back. What about the child? I know nothing. I don't want him here. Who did it? - Take him away. - Shut your mouth. You'll leave him later. You have to take care of him now. Chief. I'm sorry. So there goes my staying in shade and controlling everything from the back seat. The smell and dirt will always find a way to come near you even if your door and windows are closed. Every time I open this goddamn book police come to get me. After the killing of two cops, the police raided the house of every thug. They were searching for everything. Buy they found nothing at my place. Almost nothing. Not for directing a criminal group. Not for whacking some arseholes. Not for beating the hooligans or destroying the disco. Do you know why they put away? Because of a stupid statuette of some Egyptian god left by the elderly couple. It turned out the statuette was stolen from the museum in Cairo. Damn thieves. When you enter your cell, you need to give yourself time to assess your situation. To recognize the net of interdependencies, influences and the hierarchy which has been present here for a long time. Everything calmly, with humility. Second option, the fastest you can kill the alpha male, and the entire pack will follow you. You were great. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Whatever they say about you you're like a brother to me. Daniel is waiting for you to get out. Everything is still on. And if Walden doesn't calm down, Daniel will whack him. Hey, Chief. It's really depressing to see you in a place like that. Do you need anything? I can get you everything, cigarettes, drugs? - I have everything. - Walden… Damn, Chief, everybody is afraid of me. Girls want to sleep with me. Do you remember how they didn't want me? Now I am Mr. Life and Mr. Death, can you understand that, Chief? I'll be a king of life until they get me. It's coming soon, huh? It's coming soon. Calm down, goddammit. Give this shit up for some time and don't mess with Daniel. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Go on holidays. To Thailand for whores, to Walden Lake, wherever you want. Rest. And when I get out of here, I will deal with everything. Do you understand? I heard there will be some shipment coming to Danielek. I will steal this shipment. But not for me, I won't deal it, I don't care. I'll give it to the Addicts Center, they will think I'm a great guy. For fuck's sake, don't do anything, can you hear me? It doesn't matter, because the worst has already happened. Can you understand that, Chief? The punishment will come to all of us! Who? Who, goddammit? I'm off. Listen to me, calm down. Can you understand that? Relax! Can you hear me? Let it go, goddammit! - Do you understand? - I'll visit you next week. Don't do anything! Do you hear me, goddammit? - Take care, Chief. - You have to let it go, Walden! Let me go. Do you hear me?! Let me out. If I do nothing, in a few days, Walden, Daniel, Kwaśniak, the Loonies… They will be all dead. They will whack each other. And I will become the king of this crazy country. I only have to lie down and wait. Turn it off, goddammit. There is only one "but". Bloody Walden. I cannot leave him. Nobody is an isolated island. There are people who need money to help their relatives. Everyone has someone who he cares for. And if they don't lack money you need to use a different approach. Did the statuette belong to you? Sometimes, a man is really innocent. Yes. Did you pass the information to the defendant, that the statuette was stolen? No. It is the hardest to get to someone who thinks he has nothing to lose. Everyone can do a good deed. You only need the right motivation. - What's that? - It's the future. Can't you afford better clothes? Where is Walden? Get the hell out of here, whore, or I'll fuck you up. I can offer you a cut. Ten percent. - In exchange for what? - You will become my right-hand man. You will organize my protection. And an entire city is looking for Walden. Everyone wants to whack him. So either you do it, or we do it our way. - Who's that? - A guy from his crew. What have you done? - He was gonna tell us where Walden is. - Leave Walden to me. What are you going to do now? Maybe you should eat something? I'll do what needs to be done. This job needed to be under surveillance. It's easy to find a man if he has a house and a family. But if you're looking for someone without the address and switches his cars, girls, apartments, you've got a problem. An entire city was looking for Walden. It was a matter of time until we get him. The prosecutor's office has new information about the shootout in Olszanka. The police found a machine gun which was used to kill one of the police officers. And a kidnapped child while attempting to get back the stolen trucks. Where is Walden? I don't know. Where? I don't know, goddammit. Listen, you bloody arsehole, you are already dead. You can decide if you are going to die in ten seconds or being tortured. He's at Arczi's workshop. Thank you. Thank you. I was cleaning up the city again. The Gang of Loonies had been poisoning it the most. Chief... Are you having fun? Come on, Chief, it was my friend. I have known him since last month, he was supposed to come to my child's communion, we were supposed to go fishing together. You took the highway. Always up the hill though. When did the Chief get out? Earlier than I had it planned, you see? When they locked everybody because of Biggie Big, only the Chief was still there. Now they locked the Chief because of this bloody sculpture and I thought first you get big, then you begin to sculpture the muscles, you get it Chief? Let's bloody whack Daniel. Who will say anything to us? Who will say anything to us? Is there anyone bigger than us in this bloody country? We will be the kings, goddammit! We will go to the seaside together again. Why did you even work with this arsehole? Why did you even stop listening to me? I told you not to touch it? I asked you to leave it? Because I am who I am you either love me or you need to… I'm done anyway. I think I prefer the Chief to whack me, not them. Yes? All right. See you at your place. You were great. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Whatever they say about you, to me you are like a brother. Think who you're pointing the gun at, you scumbag. I understand that this entire case was for you very emotional. For me too. But I was relieved when I heard that the guy who wanted to kill me is dead. I will have to wait a bit to feel relieved. Until this evening, when you become an owner of stuff valued at ten million. And that's it? Some money will make my conscience clear? Conscience? You know, I prefer discussing feelings with my wife. After we have sex. There is no conscience and friendship when money is involved. This is why you work with cops? I work with everybody to come out ahead. And what do you think, what's my motivation? Money. It depends on me if you make ten million. And ten you will want to make more. This is why I want you to work for me, and carry out my orders. Is that clear? If you don't have people who would die for you, sooner or later you will become nobody. The more you're focused on money, the less you actually see what's happening around you. I think something is off. Come on, we need to run. - But the stuff… - We need to get the hell out of here. Police, on the ground! What's happening? Do you like reading books? - What? - What was the last book you were reading? What happened to all your money now? - What you will buy loyalty for? - What the hell are you talking about? I prefer discussing these matters with my wife. You… You can't do it. You know the rules. What goddamn rules? You ordered to whack my man? Why would I believe you won't whack me too? It's not the right time for this. Loyalty, you scumbag. Character, you scumbag. Friends, you scumbag. They will fuck me up. Entire city chipped in for this stuff, the Russians too. You need to buy some time. - How much? - Until 48 hours. Buy exactly the amount you need. Secondly, be always a step ahead of everyone else. What am I supposed to do there? Forget the money and think if you want to be with him. What do you need that for? You'll buy it there. Thirdly, forget all the material goods. - Where will the car be waiting? - Somewhere here. And you? Fourthly, do the job only with the people who believe in you. Not the ones you bought with money. And finally, play your role the best you can. Tell a story someone wants to hear and in reality, make your own story Sleep tight, you bloody Prince Charming. Yes? Call the fire brigade! Get the hell out of here! Don't leave your friends. Give everyone what he deserved. The rest will work out just fine. After all, I got my ten percent in the best style possible. A course to Bornholm, the plane is already waiting. Something extra. What the hell is happening? You said you wanted the sea. What sea, goddammit? Where are we? Wait here. Relax. It is our new beginning. Where the hell are we? Where are we going to? Wherever you like. Walden Lake for a good start, is that fine? Poland is that direction? Yes, it is. I've saved your junkie ass, do you understand? Has anyone even asked me if I wanted to be saved? Stop this boat, goddammit! Fuck! What? There is my life, goddammit. Fuck! We all have been killing. We all should have been dead already. You understand that? Fuck it, I'll swim there! Think about it, goddammit. Think about your girlfriend. Think about me and my family. They will torture you there and get everything from you. I never snitched on anyone. I always protected you. I even killed that kid so they didn't follow us. I can't be saved anymore. What the hell have you done, you idiot? What's going on, what has happened? Walden didn't want any help. It was me who killed him. But not then, it was much earlier, at the moment I saw him for the first time. I wanted to be a gangster and a human at the same time. But you cannot save the humanity in a world where no-one wants to be a human. You don't need to live by the same rules. PRESENT DAY - You can create your own. - The visitation is over. What next, Dad? Stick to them forever. The third part of your saga begins with a poetic description: half a ton of cocaine which you burnt, so it doesn't go on the Polish market. I really wanted to save from drugs, especially… the youngest generation. Fuck! Everything is fine, it was only a book. BAD You don't even know my name. Chief, I'm putting forward a motion to whack. They keep stealing the ball from me! Magda! To the water! All right gentlemen, are you all ready? - All right and how do you do it? - Just hit it. Come on! You can see the camera. Come, give me a hug. Beautiful. Look at him there. It is an interesting thread. Watch out. Chief's got the best wife in an entire world. But guys, what's with the long faces? Are you filming this?
