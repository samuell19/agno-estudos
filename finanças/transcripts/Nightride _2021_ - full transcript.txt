Where are they? - They're still on the motorway. - The fuckin' motorway? - They're getting in soon. - When? - Eleven p.m. - Eleven p.m.? They were meant to be here an hour ago. What am I gonna tell Felix? - Tell him they're cautious people. - They're late already. - He'll walk, he's raging... - Budge. You'll convince him. Don't get lifted. I won't get lifted. Once we do this, you'll be out. I'll be out. We'll both be out. This is what it's about, baby. What does it mean? - It means you need more practice. - Tell me. "Time is luck." Get it done. - All right, Budge? - All right, Troy. How's it going? Big night tonight? Call Felix. 11:15. Slight delay. You've already delayed the deal by a week. We froze our bollixes off last week and we're freezing them off again tonight. The people I'm getting this delivery from, they're cautious people. This is fucking amateur hour. You've never ran this sort of weight before. I'm gonna be there. 11:15. Fifty keys, fifty fucking keys, Felix, come on, come on! A minute late, the deal is off. Call Lefty. All right, Budge Budge! Turn that shit down. Turn it down, Beaker! - What's up? - What's up? Did you get the van? Aye. We're on the road. You check everything? PPE's packed in the back. Okay, I'm coming to get her. You fill her up? - We got petrol. - How much you get? - Ah... tenner's worth? - You got ten pounds petrol? That's fine for my car. It's a fucking van! Didn't I fucking tell you? Fuck off, you! Look, we're nearly parked. You want us to fill her up? Just leave it, leave it there. I'll fill her up myself. Get the van, fill her up, pick up the cash, meet the Ukrainians at 11, Felix at 11:15. I got time, I got time. Call Scholar. - You punching in? - Coming now, how's the coast? The coast is clear. Coming up on you now. Two minutes. Graham, I'm a bit pressed here. What time does the bank open? Nine a.m., partner. Nine a.m. And what happens if you're not there? We lose the deposit, except we're not going to lose the deposit. We're gonna lose the deposit and all the payments unless we complete the purchase. Understand? They're gonna forfeit us. I'm gonna be at the bank with my half. Sixty thousand. My parents have mortgaged their house to put down this money, right? I can't afford to lose this. Well, technically, it's your parents who can't afford to lose this. You think this is a fucking joke? No, Graham, I don't. No garage, no working together. This money should have been there weeks ago. - We've delayed things enough. - Graham. - It's our last shot at this. - Mate, I hear you. - You have your sixty? - I'll have it. You'll have it? I'm coming into a nice little sum tonight. No, no, no, I don't wanna know. I'm only telling you so you don't shit yourself. I don't want to know where you're getting it! Look, I'm gonna be there with my half. Sixty K in cash. We're gonna get our bodyshop. Trust me, okay? Stresshead. That's the last of it. All my gear. Everything. There's a bit extra in there. To what do I owe this generosity? After tonight, this number's not gonna work anymore. - Finally out? - Finally out. You got your other supplier lined up? Yeah. He's used to more weight than small fry like me. I had to buy a big first consignment. Ever gonna finish that PHD? I'll lose my client base when I do. - How long you been working on it? - Seven years. Seven years isn't a fuckin' thesis, that's a sentence. "Fate, Transience, and the Lonely Individual." "Films of Michael Mann." He is a fucking poet. Heat, Mohicans. First class mate. Miami Vice is my favorite. You're talking the show, right? - The movie. - Fuck off! No Don Johnson, no can do. Miami Vice is the apex of Mann's post-celluloid filmography. What's your fave? Don't tell me you're gonna be a complete clich√© - and say Heat. - Everyone's a Heat man. Thief. - That's where I'm at. - Great film. It was the template for his archetype of the lonely professional criminal. James fucking Caan just wants to be paid and you're gonna pay 'cause he's fucking James Caan. - What you doing past all this? - A business. Legit. - Won't be the same margins. - If you can't sleep, you can't sleep. Hey, Scholar. Two ways this game ends. On your terms, or their terms. Remember that. I told you to delete this number. Your other phone's off. I'm working, delete this number. I need a pep talk. I'm meeting the guy. - What guy? - The Tinder guy. Dumbo ears? - You're such a dick. - That's tonight? I told you it was. And he doesn't have Dumbo ears. I'm kidding. Why you out of breath? I'm pushing my bike. Where to? Didn't I just say I'm going on a date? On a bike? He's across town. I could've taken you. You'd only scare him off like the last guy. Last guy was three times your age. Hang on a sec. Call you back. Call Sofia. Everything okay? I have a tail. Are you sure? No, I'm not sure. I can't tell. - Have you looped around? - I was about to. Loop around, pull over, see what happens. Call Sofia. I think it's gone. I'm about to pick up the van. Any word? The Ukrainians called. They're getting cold feet again? - Not yet. - Listen, Sofia. The Ukrainians need to be there. The gear needs to be there. As soon as I take that money from Joe, I owe him twenty on top. My dulcet tones will assuage them. Fuck me, your fucking English is better than mine. And your Ukrainian is worse than my brother's dog's. - Eleven p.m. - Eleven p.m. Call Cuz. I'm ready for your words of wisdom. Just don't get so nervous that you can't enjoy yourself. That's all? If things get jazzy, this time you call me, okay? So I won't delete this number? Not yet but emergencies only. Standard. Get your garage yet? It's not a garage, it's a bodyshop. What's the difference? Garages fill your tires up. Nightride Autobody doesn't just fill your tires up. What does Nightride Autobody do? Nightride Autobody offers bespoke nut and bolt customizations. Retrimming, rewiring, repainting, you name it. - You bought it yet? - Completing tomorrow. Will you give me a job? I'll think about it. I've thought about it. It's gonna be a hard no. Let me know how it goes with Dumbo. You're a fucking dick... Call Sofia. You doing okay? Do you need me? I just wanted to hear your voice. I'm here, baby. Anything I can do? Nothing. Promise? I promise. Call Graham. Forgot our time already? Where you at? Peking Palace, waiting on a carry out. Peking Palace, Lisburn Road? What's this about? I'm in a jam. I need you to pick up some cash for me. Is this the cash for tomorrow? No, it's the cash I need to get the cash for tomorrow. You're doing a fucking deal? That's how you're getting the cash? Graham, you've always known what I do and you know I'm done doing it, after tonight. Why don't you get it yourself? I've got a tail on me. Then why the fuck me? Because I trust you. You're calling me because you know I'll do it, you manipulative bastard. So you'll do it? How much? A hundred marks. - Who from? - Joe's fronting me. - Joe who? - Joe. Joe the nut? Not Joe the Nut, don't tell me it's Joe the Nut. It's just a bridge loan. He puts people under slabs. I'm heading into extra time here. I need that money picked up now and delivered by 11 p.m. or I'm not at the bank tomorrow at nine and your parents lose their money. Just picking up a bag. In and out. He's a fucking psycho! And you're a fucking civilian. So there's nothing to worry about. This has got nothing to do with me. I accept that and I'm asking you as my business partner to extend a personal favor so I can leave this fucking shit behind. Talk to me, Graham. All right. Let's do this. What's the fucking play? Go to Shigsy's. Go through the pool hall in the back. Other side, there's a door. They'll be waiting with the cash. I'll tell them to expect you. And then what am I doing? One step at a time, partner. Just get the cash. - Graham? - I'm getting my order. I don't have fucking time, go now! Okay, okay, I'm walking. I'll buy you a Peking fucking Emperor's Feast when this is done. - How long to get there? - Ten minutes. Are you paraplegic? All right, all right, five minutes. Call Lefty. All right, Budge! Where you guys at? South end of Ormeau Road. We stopped at the Errigle for a round. You had a drink yet? - Beaker's getting the order. - Don't. I need you to come back and get the van. - What's up? - I think I've got a tail. Fuckin' Feds? - Five-O? - Don't fucking say that. - You think we're bugged? - No because it sounds daft. I can't drive the van now, you guys need to do it. Beaker's just back. I'm not driving, can I have a drink? Get back on the road. When you get the van, you're gonna have to stop on the way, get petrol. - How much petrol? - Just fill it up, Lefty. Okay, okay! I'll call you back in a minute and give you more instructions. Indicate you heard me. I heard you one hundred percent. Call Joe. It won't be me picking-up the money. I don't like surprises. That's why I'm calling. Who you sending? Just a civilian. A business associate. Run it by me again, one more time. The Ukrainians are getting out of the business. Too much blood down South. So they're offloading their inventory. But they don't wanna sell to their rivals. Someone close to me made the connect. And you trust that person? With my life. Your buyer is ready? He's locked in. On stand-by. Once you take my cash, it comes back to me with my premium. I don't care if you come back in five minutes, once you take out 100, I get back 120. Do you understand? I do. When I call, you pick up. Okay? Sure, no problem. You pick up. Understood? Understood. We're back in the van. Okay, now listen very carefully, both of you. Aye, we're listening, aye. Drive the van to Cutter's Wharf. Cutter's Wharf, yeah. That's where the sellers will be waiting for you. They're Ukrainians. They'll pack the van with the gear themselves but doublecheck it's in nice and tight under that PPE. - Yep. - Beaker, are you with us? Aye aye, Budge! One hundred percent. Lefty, say it back to me. Drive to the sellers at Cutter's Wharf. They'll pack the van with the gear. What about the cash? I've a friend coming with it, he's a civilian. What the fuck do you mean? We can handle the cash. We're solid as a block of flats! Guys, just focus on the fucking van. Get it to the Ukrainians. Don't piss them off. Don't be making no fucking jokes either. If you take the piss out of these guys, they'll fucking bolt. What if they say something to us? They're fucking Ukrainians. They're gonna say fuck all. The only English they speak is "Where's the drugs?" and "Pass the hammer". Hang on. Just promise me, Lefty, promise me you're dialed in. Dialed in mate. One hundred percent. Get the van. Get the gear. Then what are you gonna do? You're about to tell us. Then you're gonna drive the van to the buyer. He's waiting for it at Church Road car park. I repeat, Church Road. The buyer's name is Felix, as in Felix the Cat. Felix. Church Road. We got this boss, don't you fucking worry. Okay. Bell me when you're there. Call Graham. Tell me you're at Shigsy's. Almost. Thirty seconds. When you get the money, get in a cab. Tell them to take you to Cutter's Wharf. It's very close to you. My boys will be there in a van. How do I know which van? It says Captain Happy's Happy Nappies on the side. - Is that a fucking joke? - It's a description. Who's gonna move fifty keys in a van like that? I'm bringing cash to a fucking deal? Don't back out of this now, partner, you just need to show up and hand it over. You won't see any product. Jesus... Jesus... Jesus. In ten minutes, it'll all be done. And I'll be at the bank tomorrow, okay? I'm here, I'm here at Shigsy's. Call me after. Call Felix. - Let's hear it. - It's not gonna be me at the drop. - Why aren't you delivering? - I might have a tail. - You might? - Well, I haven't fucking pulled them over and asked them, have I? I'm sending my guys, you can trust them. If you think you've got a tail, we should call it off. It's probably nothing, but rather than putting us all at risk, I'm changing the arrangement. Am I right in saying you've never been lifted? I've never been lifted. Not once. Beginning to wonder why. Because I'm careful, Felix. I protect myself and I protect those I do business with. Do you want this fucking product or not? Because I don't know where else you're gonna get a deal this good. If it doesn't come through, it's off. Last fucking chance, okay. Last chance. - We're at the Wharf. - Are the Ukrainians there? - Aye, they're waiting on the money. - Okay, okay. Any minute now. Stay on the line, I'm putting you on hold. Call Graham. - What's happening? - They're getting impatient. I'm worried they're gonna bounce. One minute, my guy's almost there. Stay on the line. Tell them a joke or something. I don't know. The pair of them... They're like the fucking Borg. Stay on the line. Call Graham. Aw, man, this fucking bag is heavy. You in the cab? Two minutes from Cutter's Wharf. Good lad. Joe say anything to you? Yeah. He wanted to know my name. You tell him? Was I not supposed to? Doesn't matter, it's fine, it's fine. - Lefty? - Aye. Still here. The money's almost there. Call me as soon as it's done. Yes, boss. As soon as it's done. Good luck. We in business? Those guys weren't fucking around! You got them all? Fifty keys? In the van. We got the PPE on top. Everything's flush. Once you get the petrol, drive straight to Felix. Beaker needs to take a shit. Take a shit later. Just get the deal done. Pull in here, Beaker. We're stopping for petrol now. Call me when it's done. And Lefty? Be fast but don't drive like a dickhead. Call Graham. Mate, I owe you a Peking Emperor's feast. You okay? I'm okay. Graham, are you okay? I won't lie, mate. I'm getting a bit aroused by it all. See you at the bank tomorrow. Nine a.m. Dumbo stand you up? Nah. I'm early. So you're bored and decided to call me. What am I, chopped liver? Fine. I'll hang up. No you won't. Still nervous? A little bit. Hold trust. Remember like Ganpa would say? Hold trust. Ganpa. Only you called him that. Look, you'll be fine. You find somewhere to lock your bike? I'm gonna bring it with me. - Late night stroll, is it? - Something like that. Just make sure he pushes your bike for you. You'll know what you're dealing with if he does and even more if he doesn't. Be careful. Speak later. - How many times did I tell you? - Lefty! I can't see the van from inside the toilet. You shouldn't have left. Fellas! Budge... listen. What is it? What happened? - The van is gone. - Say again? It's gone. Someone took it at the station. Someone took the van. - Is this a wind up? - No. Who took it? - We didn't see. - Where the fuck where you? - Paying for the petrol. - Where was Beaker? He was taking a shit. Hang on... You left it unattended. When you gotta go, you gotta go. You left a van with 200 grand's worth of gear unattended? Budge, I'm sorry. Just shut up a minute. Just shut the fuck up. Fuck. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Fuck. I'm gonna drive around South. See if I can spot the van. But I want you to go into the garage, tell whoever's on duty your vehicle was stolen and you've called the police. Ask to check their CCTV immediately. Okay, okay. Am I actually calling the police? Are you fucking high? Nothing, sorry, forget it. I need you sharp, man. Like a laser, mate. Fast, Lefty. Jesus Christ, call Sofi... Fuck, who am I calling? Call Felix. You better tell me they're around the corner. Listen. We have the product, okay? Everything's in place. Bad news. You need to wait a little bit longer. So go home, warm your bollixes, wait for my call. Good news. As a token of respect, I'm gonna give you ten off the price. You fuckin' joker. Felix, let's just talk for a minute. Don't fucking call this number again, you hear me? Twenty. Twenty off the price. If I fucking see you, I'll kick your fucking head in. No. Wait, wait, wait, Felix. Felix! Call Felix. Fuck! Call Sofia. It's all gone wrong. It's all wrong. Talk to me. The van's gone. Someone took it. - I don't understand. - Someone stole the van. Now the buyer has pulled out. I thought you were driving it. I still had a tail on me. I got my guys to do it. Those eejits? You know they're eejits! They're my guys. I could have done it. I know. You don't trust me. I trust you with my life. Then why didn't you fucking ask me? Because I wanted to protect you. You know what's gonna happen if I don't get that money to Joe. We can turn this around. Not without a buyer. Find another buyer. - Tonight. - Tonight? I don't even have the fucking van. You're going to find the van. And you're going to find a new buyer. And you're going to do it tonight. I'm gonna find the van. - I'm gonna find a buyer. - You can do this. Keep it tight. Okay. Lefty! The guy in the garage showed us where they watch the cameras. Had to pay a fifty fucking quid. Shall I tell you what I'm looking at? Yes. Go. I'm looking at the CCTV. The nuts on this guy, dives right in and spins off, but guess what? - I know the cunt from juvie! - Who is he? He had a nickname in the pen. Turkey, or something. - Look, I've seen him around. - Around where? Around the place. Uh, Bernard's Estate. Get the hell over there! Beaker's making calls to find some pals who know him. Just get over there, the pair of you. We're grabbing an Uber as soon as I hang up. An Uber? Yeah. The van was stolen. I know the fucking van was stolen, just get moving, give me updates. Call Magic Shop. Leave a message. I don't know what your plans are tonight, but best put them aside, 'cause I've got something for you. It's a nice bit of gear, and I've got to move it right now. I've a few people on the hook for it, so first come first served. You bell me back. Joe. Sorry I missed you. I told you to pick up. I was dealing with something. There's been a slight delay. Nothing I can't sort out. That's not what I heard. What did you hear? I heard your buyer pulled out. You think I don't do my due diligence? I like to keep an eye on my money. I'm sorting it out. Oh, so it's true, then. Your buyer has pulled out. I've got someone else lined up. Just need a little bit of time. You still have the product? I'm on top of things, okay? You said I'd have my money by midnight. Midnight's still in play. I can't have people thinking I'm going soft. Trust me, Joe. Nobody's worried about that. Joe! Call Graham. Call Magic Shop. Leave a message. Call Graham. - I do something wrong? - You did everything right. I just need one more favor. I need a loan. You have your half of the deposit. What else on top of the sixty? Are you being serious? - What about Linda then? - Don't even go there. I'm in trouble. What kind of trouble? I need cash, right now. What about your parents? Jesus Christ, man. You come from money. When you come from money, your money's in a bank, I don't know what your family was like. - We're partners. - Don't do that. He's going to put me under a slab, mate. Find another way. Call Magic Shop. Leave a message. Magic Shop, what's the deal? Come on, there's a lot of bidding on this, there's a lot going on it. I'm giving you a steal, man, I'm giving you a fucking gift. Let's go, let's do this. I'm waiting, buddy. Lefty. My mate said he saw Turkey coming out of Booze Brothers. Was the van there? Couldn't say if it was our van or not. You tell him there's a big logo on it? Captain Happy's. Aye, he said it was too far to make it out. - Where are you now? - About ten minutes from the estate. Tell your driver to scoot. Hey, can we go faster please, pal? This is a sixty zone. You can drive seventy in a sixty. Are you fucking daft? - Lefty! - Just go where we tell you to go! Lefty! Calm it down. Don't get chucked out. - All right. - Just get there. Is this an emergency? No. Then it's not a good time. I think Dumbo stood me up. Maybe he's running late. He's ghosting me. Wait another minute. I'm waiting ten minutes already, freezing my tits off out here. Look, sorry, Cuz. His loss. You always say that. I don't fucking believe this. Call you back. Gonna be on my ass all fucking night, are you? Okay. Your funeral. Let's do this. Let's fucking do this. All right, let's do this. Let's do this. Let's fucking do this. You wanna take me in? Let's dance. Troy. All right, Budge? Buddy? It's all right, yeah. What a night, eh? Not the best I've ever had. You been following me? Why would I be following you? You working with the police? You calling me a tout? Come on, Budge. You know me. Only time I speak to a cop is before I punch 'em to get a free breakfast. I just thought... I just thought you were tailing me. You thought I was tailing you? Yeah. I was tailing you. Why were you tailing me, Troy? Because Joe asked me to. You know Joe. Likes to keep an eye on his money. All night, that was you, huh? Aye. You fucked up the whole deal. I thought you were police. I was gonna handle everything myself. I would have had the fucking money! So you don't have the money. Mm? I don't think there's 120 grand here. I think, in fact, it's more like five hundred quid. I'm getting it. I just need time. That's what they all say. Who? The silent choir. The ghosts of unpaid debts. All settled now. I don't know what that means, Troy. Can you feel what it means? Come here. There's something I want to show you. I'm all right where I am. I insist. It's not personal. It's just business. It's not good business. If something happens to me, Joe won't get his money back. I don't think he was expecting to. Then why would he give me the money? To make an example of you. Joe's worried people think he's going soft. No one thinks Joe's going soft. Joe thinks it. And that's enough. Stand there. Okay. I'm standing here. Turn around. Joe ask you to scare me, yeah? Jesus Christ. All right. Please. Troy. Don't... Don't do this. You don't want to do this, you... You think I want to do this? I don't. You remember the time I had to knock you about at the club after what you said about my wife? I didn't take any pleasure in it. But I had to do it. Don't... No, no, no! You know, there might be another way. Anything. Anything. Just tell me, Troy. Just tell me. - Joe wants to send a message, right? - Yeah. And you... You can be the message. A fucking Halloween myth around Newtownards to scare the wee scallies to sleep. Or... you can deliver the message. What do you mean? What the fuck do you think I mean? Get up. 3D-printed. You hold it by the grip. Squeeze the trigger. Just like in the movies. Careful. Don't blow your dick off. Put this in your GPS. This is what he looks like. He's gonna be there for the next half an hour. And wear this. In case there's witnesses. I would do them anyway but... you're the one facing the stretch. Do you need a wee buzz going? I don't use. Ironic. This was my idea. Joe, he just wanted to whack you. I know you're gonna do the job. I don't think I can, Troy. He's not a mate of yours. He's just a man whose continued existence risks harm to the people you love. Now I know that you're going to do the job. For the people you love. Location entered. You are seven minutes from your destination. Drive straight to stay on Dargan Road. After two hundred yards, turn right. Tell me what's going on. I've negotiated something with Joe. More time? I have to do a job for him. Right now. What kind of job? Can't tell you that. Turn right. In fifty yards, turn left. Why not? Because it would make you an accessory. - Turn left. - We're in this together. Not this. This is on me. Find the van. Find a buyer. It's too late for all that. If I do this, I'm out of the red. This isn't who you are. It's who I have to be. After one hundred yards, turn right. Turn right. You didn't call me back. Cuz, I'm a little hard-pressed here. What's wrong? What happened? Where are you? I'm about to cycle home. Okay, chin up. Wow. - What? - Eager to get me off the phone much? - Cuz... - I've had a shit night. Excuse me all to hell for thinking highly of you. If I can't talk to you, who can I talk to? You can talk to me. I'm sick of it. Of what? Everything. Why can't you give me a job in your garage? If it makes you feel any better, that's not gonna happen now. What do you mean? There is no garage anymore. You want a job? Find a van with Captain Happy printed on the side and a trunk full of fucking gear and PPE, there's a job. Magic Shop! - What you got? - Fifty keys. But I gotta move 'em now. - What's the bid? - Two hundred. Eighty-five, offer. For half? For the lot. Can't deal on that. What can you deal on? I'll settle on 180, but it's bullshit. Ninety. Are we doing business or not? Ninety, final offer. Take or leave. I'm not going below 120. Bigger the load, higher the risk. The Feds are everywhere and you've given us little notice. I can't check you out. How do I know I'm not walking into a trap? I've never been lifted. Maybe because you're a tout. If I was a fucking tout, they'd lift me so people wouldn't think I was a tout, use your brains. You're either lucky, or you're not. But I'm not getting into a midnight deal unless it's worth the risk. Final offer of ninety. I can't do it. Say hello to your police friends. You should be almost there. I know the fella. Have you done this before? No. I know what that feels like. You know, maybe you need to work yourself into it. Get yourself in the mood, you know? As soon as he opens the door, you smack him in the head with it, right? You drag him through the house, and then when you're ready, you shoot him in the face. Empty the rest into his chest, or his back or whatever. Then you walk away. Don't run. People look to people running. And don't chuck the piece. I want that back. After one hundred yards, turn left. In fifty yards, turn left. Turn left. There's another way. We leave the country. Tonight. And go where? There's a flight to Kiev at six a.m. We drive straight to the airport and spend the rest of the night there. How much are the flights? Five hundred for both of us. I don't have it. - What about the money from Scholar? - I don't have it. And I'm not fucking living in the Ukraine. I got people here who depend on me. And I'm not running. I'm not running. After one hundred yards, you have reached your destination. Baby... Don't do this. If you do this, there's no coming back from it. Do you understand? He'll own you, he'll... You have reached your destination. - Yeah. Where are you? - On the estate. Listen, turns out we got the name wrong. It wasn't Turkey, it was Rooster 'cause of his huge nozzle. - Kinda like Beaker. - Fuck off! - Lighten up, will you? - I'm not in the fucking mood. There's a house on the estate where Rooster goes to get bombed. Budge, are you getting this? - You have an address? - Not yet. It's a small estate. Look for a party. Loud music. Otherwise it's a stash house. Boarded windows, grass that needs trimming, you get the idea. - Sounds like Beaker's house. - Fuck off! Guys, if you find it, you call me soon as, okay? - Soon as! - Understood, boss. Down! Get down! Shut the fuck up! Down! Get down on your knees! Down on the ground! Can't show your face when you do it? Fucking plot twist! Why are you involved with Joe? I told you I had to buy more weight to get on the floor with my supplier. Where do you think I got the money from? Look... I haven't shifted the gear yet. I just need more time. If I don't do you, he's gonna do me. You're out of time, mate. Fuck! Boss. We have him. Rooster. We're outside his house. You should see the place, it's like a fucking... toxic waste site. It's our guy? Beaker saw him through the window giving himself a nice little jab. You're positive it's our guy? It's defo him! Kick the door in, lift the thieving cunt, find out where he is, find out where that fucking van is. Who's your connect? - What? - What's your fucking supplier's name? Ringo. Ringo? Never heard of him. Never heard of The Beatles? You are a funny cunt with a gun to your head. Even funnier without one. I need that connect. I need it right now. Look... This guy, he's a serious man. Yeah? Serious. I need that connect. I need it right now. I got a lot of product. I need to shift it on. I need to shift it on now! Make the call! Okay. - Now! - Right. It's engaged. - He'll call back, that's his system. - When? I don't know, soon? Call him again. It's engaged. Then leave a fucking message! It's Scholar. I've got a guy who might have something you want. Something really good. Call me back. How long till he gets back to you? Sometimes right away, and sometimes... You know, longer. You know who's not gonna be happy you're breathing? Joe. It's my life on the line now. You understand? It's my life. I'll make it happen. You can trust me. I hope so. Because I'm running out of time. Time is luck. - What you say? - Miami Vice. It's my favorite line. What's that? What you just said in Ukrainian. - You speak Ukrainian? - Not a chance. Sorry I put you through the window. Call Sofia. Did you... No, I didn't. I think I have a buyer. But still no van? We're close. I should take this. - I'm glad you didn't do it. - Me, too. Budge... - I love... - Don't say it. Not until it's done. Did you deliver my message? I've got one for you. Your money's coming. The capital and the vig. Is it done? Scholar's going to pay you back. You weren't there to collect. You were there to deliver. That's not who I am. Who you are isn't going to be a thing anymore. Just a little more time. It's ran out. Clock has stopped. I'm calling in my collateral. I didn't put up any. Yes, you did. Soon as you dealt with me. The people you love. Call Sofia. Call Sofia. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Where were you? - I was in the loo. - Are you on your own? Uh, yeah, why? I want you to check outside the house, see if anyone's there. - What am I looking for? - A white SUV. - Tinted windows? - Fuck. Get out. Get out of the house. I think they saw me. They're getting out. It's Joe's guys. They're coming for you. Get out now. I'm taking the back door. Grab the footladder under the stairs first. You're gonna have to scale that back wall. - All your fucking crap is everywhere. - Hoof it out of the way. - Sofia? - Yes, I have it. Back door, go, go, go. What's that? They're kicking in the front door. You outside? Yes, hold on. There's a catch on the side. I'm trying. It's rusty, sometimes you have to give it... I have it. What's happening? I'm on the wall. Can you drop down? It's high. They're inside. Lower yourself down and drop. You'll be fine. Do it now. Sofia? Sofia! My ankle! Ignore it, keep moving. I need my car. Forget it, go on foot. They're in the house, I'll circle around. Forget it, just get to a busy street. - I'm going to make a run for my car. - Jesus, no, Sofia! It's too risky, they might be waiting. I can make it. Jee, Sofia, don't! Your ankle! What? You want to die tonight? Baby, drive, go! You clear? Sofia, talk to me. Talk to me. Sofia! Sofia? I'm here. I'm fine. - Are they on you? - No, I'm clear. Now what? Go to your brother's. You're okay? I am now. - Hello, how are you? - How are you? Not too bad. You have a certificate of insurance and driving license? I do. Indeed. - Right. - Working tonight, are you? - Yeah, yeah. Been a late one. - A late one. Been a late one. Do you have your insurance policy? It's not showing up on our system. Insurance policy. I gotta have one here. Somewhere. Ah... I've been driving around all day to different places. I thought I was going till six, but you know? Can you run a check on this guy? See if he's on the system. - Give me two seconds, okay? - Sure, sure. I'll keep looking for my driver's license. - No, we got your license, you're all right. - Okay. Okay. Good, good, good. - There's your license back, okay? - Legend. Don't worry. - You're good to go, mate. - All the best. Thank you. Call Scholar. - I need that connect. - I left him a message. - He doesn't like to be pestered. - You fucking owe me! Leave him my number. Tell him to call me direct. I'm ready to go. Okay, okay, I'll ring him now. Call Lefty. Talk to me. I'm here with Rooster. He's messed up on junk. We're slapping him around to get answers but he's not making a lot of sense. And the van? He remembers driving it, can't remember where he's parked it. Did he know what was in it? I don't think so, he's tripping out. Pissed himself. It stinks in here! We have to find where he parked that van. Keep working him. Hello? We've a mutual friend who's a Scholar. Would this be Mister Starr? You can call me Ringo. What do you have for me? Fifty keys, hundred percent pure. I might be able to take that off your hands. Two hundred. That's a bundle. I was told you were a serious man. One fifty. With this product we're talking 190, minimum. One sixty. My interest is fading. Can't deal on that. One eighty, that's my floor. No deal. Then hang up. How fast can you move it? It's in a van, ready to go. - You got a place? - Quays? Nah. It's a hot spot. Glen Park. That works for me. Give me an hour. You need time for a coffee and a Danish? What takes an hour? Just let me get things lined up, yeah? I was told you were ready to go. If we're doing this, we're doing it at midnight. It's that, or I walk. Look, I want to move it fast but that's too tight. Why? Because you want to get surveillance vans in place to lift me? What, you think I'm a Fed? Guy calls me in the middle of the night with a hot deal... Okay! Okay. Call Lefty. - Tell me you found it. - On the move. He said he abandoned it under a railway bridge close by. I know the one he's talking about. - You're on the way? - Yeah. There in two minutes. Good lad. Stay on the line. Call Sofia. You at your brother's yet? He's making me tea. My fucking ankle's killing me. I got a buyer. Enough for Joe, and enough for the garage - but no honeymoon. - Fuck the honeymoon. Maybe a weekend in Portrush. How does that sound? - It'll rain the whole time. - Won't let up for a minute. See you soon. - What's the good word? - No van. What? No van, he fucked us! You looked everywhere? Under it, over it, it's not here. You're under the bridge. Look up and down the street. Mate, I checked, it's a dead end. I think he was too out of it to remember and he bluffed us. - Tell us what to do, Budge. - I need to think. I need to think. Warming up that concrete drill of yours? Don't worry. It's not for you. Yet. No? Who's the lucky guy? A friend of yours. Budge! Just pay them! Just pay the man. Graham. Get the picture? He's a civilian. Who was brought into this by you. Your own violation. Don't blame me for taking advantage. Have you hurt him? Not seriously. Not yet. I told you I can't have people thinking I'm going soft. Do you understand? So, what's it gonna be? Any ideas? Come on. You're smart. So be smart. Take me. I'll trade. Him for me. Now you get it. Always have security on your collateral. Tell me where to go. Meet Troy at the Ferryhouse. If you're later than midnight, we drill holes all the way through your friend's legs. And if you don't show... you know what happens. Call Sofia. Sof, I uh... What is it? Joe has Graham. Oh, no. I agreed to trade. Trade what? - Do you have the van? - No van. Joe wants an exchange. - You can't. - I have to. - No, you don't. - I got him into this. - Joe will kill you. - He'll kill Graham. - He'll torture you first. - Sofia. Call... Call the police. You know I can't do that. Fuck the fucking rules! Look, it's not about that, there's not enough time. Graham didn't have to involve himself. He made the choice, he did! He has kids. I wanted kids! - You don't have to do this. - Yes. I do. I'm sorry. I love you. I want you to tell me. I want you to say it. - No, no... - Please. I... I love you. Call Lefty. - We're still looking. - It's over. What are you talking about? You got my patch. Take good care of it. Sofia will sort you out with a bit of cash. - We haven't found the van yet. - The night is over. You did your best, lads. What's he on about? Budge. Mate. - I don't understand. - You will. Final lesson. Hey, I've been trying to get through to you. I'm sorry I lost my head earlier. You were under a lot of stress. I always liked you. What are you on about? It means what it means. You didn't find your van, did you? No. I know you didn't. - How do you know that? - Because it's right in front of me. You're fucking with me! Captain Happy's Happy Nappies on the side. Trunk full of PPE. Where are you? Lagan Way Carpark. Soon as I hung up I'd cut through it. Was the van open? - Isn't locked. - Keys in it? I'll check. Cuz... Hang on. Keys in the ignition! Those fucking wankers! - I can drive. - You're fifteen. I can drive better than you. Can you even see over a steering wheel? Where does it need to be? Glen Park in eleven minutes. I can do it in five. If those cops lift you... I'll say I'm underage and I was being exploited and I didn't know their names. I have taught you well, Young Padawan. So I can have a job then? You can have any job you like if you get that van there, huh? Call Sofia. Come on, come on, come on. - Baby? - We found the fucking van! We found the fucking van! Can you walk on that ankle? I can do it. Cuz is driving it to Glen Park to the buyer. You need to collect the cash from him. Bring it to me. You gotta be fast, this guy's gonna walk if you're not on time. We have till midnight, that's... Oh fuck, not much time. Wh... Where am I taking the money? Drive to the Ferryhouse. Remember where I took you on our first night together? - We watched the boats go out. - That's the place. That's where I'll be. How long you got? Midnight. That's not enough time. I'll make time. I'll get this done. You can trust me. Call Ringo. You coming round the mountain? - I'm not doing the drop. - I don't like strangers. Mate. I'm a fucking stranger. - Who you sending? - Two birds. They're solid as rocks. The van better be here in five. It'll be with you in two. Where's the piece? What? The piece I gave you. We'll need that back. Why? What do you think I'm here for? To give you a nosh? Now how do you know I won't do you? Because you're here for your friend. Not last-minute heroics. Where is he? With Joe. Waiting on my call. I want proof of life. Oh! Got the lingo down and all, eh? He wants to hear that his mate's okay. Okay. I'll put you on speaker. Budge! Just pay the man! Put Joe on. Mate... I was gonna make this nice and quick for old time's sake. - But you're taking the piss. - Put him on! We'll do the pair of you if you keep this up. Money's on its way. Right this second. Coming right here. Who's the buyer? He's called Ringo. Never fucking heard of him. Never heard of The Beatles? Why is this cunt still breathing? He has my gun. Let me call him. The deal has just gone down. Money's on its way. Troy. Take the piece. I've got the piece. Call your buyer, let's hear him. He'll tell us. He'll tell us. What do you want? Is the deal done? Call your compatriots. Did she get the cash? That's generally how these things work. - When did she leave you? - About two minutes ago. Was that a fucking kid you had driving... Boss. What's the story here? My girl will be here. Joe! My girl will be here. Trust me. Just a couple more minutes. What do you think, Troy? I think she's fucked him. I think he's never going to see here again. Two minutes is all I need. Give that silly fool one minute. Then whack him. One minute. She's probably on her way to the airport right now. First flight back to Kiev. She wouldn't do that. This girl played the long game. It wasn't a game. Thirty seconds. You almost pulled this off tonight. You're a smart cunt, I'll give you that. But you always had this massive blind spot for the birds. I'm going to take you out through the heart. Because it's the heart that took you out. My heart's made of steel. Forged by her hands. Accept it. She didn't betray me. She fucking did betray you. I know you had a rough time with your ex. - What the fuck did you say about my wife? - Nothing! Nothing at all, just... My girl is coming. She's coming. I know it. Prove me wrong. Just a little more time. I'm gonna you thirty seconds. Thirty seconds. I'm disobeying an order just to win the argument. That's Joe. Checking to see if you've been whacked. This is how it ends, mate. No bangs. Just whimpers. Last words. What? Last words. I like to keep them in a wee exercise book. The songs of the silent choir. Let's hear them. What the fuck are you saying? Time is luck. Stop right there! I've got it. I've got your money. Count it. One twenty. - We healthy? - I got the money. It's all there. No. I didn't shoot him. I was showing initiative, wasn't I? He wants to speak to you. Your friend is being left by the towpath. Is he okay? He's walking, isn't he? When do you guys open? Grand opening, two weeks. I've got a Hummer, I want some decal tints put in. Leave her by. It'll cost you. I'm sure it will. Goodbye, Joe. Next time... There won't be no next time. We still got the sixty? I separated it in the van. Driving one-handed on the motorway. That's my girl. - You bastard son of a bitch. - Graham. - I pissed myself! - I got the money. Selfish... - You what? - I got the sixty. I have the sixty, Graham. At my feet. Give me one good fucking reason why I shouldn't cut all ties with you after what you've put me through? Let's have a moment of candor, huh? You entered into a business relationship with a man who's exiting the drug trade. Okay? Now you might say it's because you took a shine to me, I might say it's because you fancied a walk on the dark side, well... You've had that tonight, mate. And now you know it's not for you, and guess what? It's not for me either. 'Cause now I'm out. You're out? I'm out. Nine a.m., at the bank. What's the story, boss? I was about to clock off. I got another job for you. A pair of hoods called Lefty and Beaker. I need them sorted out. Your night's just about to get started. What a night.
