How'd you know I was alone? Well, he could have been with me so... I know, but maybe try not to completely destroy my life the next time you're lonely. I mean... Yeah. Yeah, I set a really high standard for. Excuse me. Ma'am. Excuse me. I know you can hear me. Ah, shit. I knew you saw me in the parking lot. Okay, so we're just walking into somebody else's... This is exactly as I pictured it. What the hell does that mean? Not the specifics, but the tone, the tone fits. Erica Shaw, I Googled you. That's not less unsettling. When I hired you to do my sister's funeral, I looked up a few business reviews online, but I had no idea my sister was getting a video send-off from one of the most promising new voices in American documentary. Wow. What happened? You Googled me. For the record, there was no way you could've known that - that kid was... - Lotta work. Excuse me? I have a lot of work I have a deadline... - How did you know? - What? The house, red, A frame? You give me the photos, I cut everything together according to aesthetic continuity... I was the only one she told about the affair. How did you know? I saw it. So what? I saw the... truth, the thing behind what everybody else sees. It just happens sometimes... certain people, pictures, places, I have an instinct or... A gift. Isn't that what you used to call it in interviews. Yeah. I thought that sounded real cool when I was 20. - Until of course... - Can I point you toward a grief counselor or a therapist or someone who, I don't know, isn't in my apartment? I didn't come here to talk about my sister. I have another job for you. Another dead relative? I'm sorry, that was... I was out of line. A different kind of job, more in line with what you used to do. Not a real documentary, not yet at least. But my father, Campbell Bradford, has led quite a life, what I know about it. He comes from this small town in Indiana, West Baden... Midwestern, forgettable, whatever... I just make funeral videos now and weddings, if it's a light month, that's all. I figured someone with your unique skill set might be able to uncover a little bit about - who he was there, his history. - I'm not the right person. The advance will cover as much as you'd make if you worked every single day for the next two months. You should go see him before you leave for Indiana. I didn't say I was gonna do this. It would be good to meet the inspiration for your next film. I've already booked a room for you. Just wait till you see the hotel down there. Oh, I almost forgot. My sister found this in my father's safe when she was going through his things and getting them in order. It's a relic from West Baden. I thought you might find it useful or interesting or whatever. It's the only thing that survived the crash. Jesus. Okay. Mr. Bradford? Campbell, my name is Erica Shaw, your daughter hired me to... Well, I don't know exactly, but she's used to getting what she wants, isn't she? Level with me Campbell, she's part witch, right? I knew it. I've got to say most people looked pretty nervous on camera, but you look totally unfazed. I like your taste in music. It's haunting. Nice. Okay, well, whenever you're ready, let it all out. Hopes, dreams, regrets. Okay. She can't say I didn't try. Hello. You messing with me, Campbell? Oh, come on. All right, okay. That's good. That's a good one. You got me. Well, you feel like talking? Yes. Holy shit, he speaks. Pardon my... It's all right, it's fine. Okay. So this job I'm supposed to find out about your past before Chicago. Feel like saying anything? There's not much to say. And whatever you do say is only gonna be when I'm looking through the camera, is that right? Okay, gotta admire your commitment to the bit. Tell me about the town. West Baden, is it? Nice place... to hide. Hide? Disappear. - Why would you wanna disap... - It's the river. It runs deep under the whole town. Never find you in there... Who wouldn't? Can we go back? Why would you be hiding? I'm confused. Tell me about the river. Look, I don't wanna press you, but this might be your only chance to tell your story in your words. No? Okay. What about this? You know anything about this? Does this mean anything to you? His blood. His name. Who's name. You should not have this. - Your daughter gave it to me. - It's evil. It's broken. What have you done? I'm sorry, I thought it was just... What have you done? Why is the bottle so important, Campbell? Why is the bottle so important? Mister... Campbell? Wait till you see the inside. Never gets old, does it? Are you here on business or for the rebirth festival? No, no, definitely business. I can tell. I can always tell, but if I may be so, I hope you'll be joining us for the big event. You might be thinking you know, but trust me, you don't. It is fun for the whole... Are you here alone? Doesn't matter. You're gonna love it. I'm Dylan. I run all the special events here. None more special than our yearly festival, which I truly hope you'll be able to attend. I don't think I... I'll put you down as a maybe. Leaning yes. Don't underestimate the charm of this place. We'll get you one way or another. Business or rebirth. What have you done? You try the water? Famous for our water down here. Springs. People used to say it cured everything from cavities to cancer. Figure whatever you're dealing with might fit somewhere in there. Is it that obvious? You're too young to be asking the bartender to turn down the music. It's just a headache. Where are you from? You know, I'm not really in... Message received. Sometimes a woman just needs to drink alone all by herself, an island. Even in a world where we've already lost all sense of community and the only real contact we have anymore is through the internet and email... - Chicago. - I love Chicago. I mean, it's been years, decades. Used to take the train there all the time with my husband before the kids. Trains haven't run in years, but the tracks are still out back just off the property. Used to be the only way in or out if you were coming from out of town. Now, well, it's almost too easy to get here, isn't it? Ann McKinney. Erica Shaw. What brings you to West Baden, Ms. Shaw? - I'm a filmmaker. - Fancy. Not really that kind of, um... It's a documentary... You're making a documentary about the hotel. I don't know exactly. Actually IU's sending me an intern. She's gonna be here any minute, so I should... Rebuilt in 1902 after it burned down for the second time. Forget about death and taxes. This hotel is the one true certainty in West Baden. Yeah? I mean, look at it. Really look. Like one of those churches you hear about in Italy or somewhere like that. Sure is something, isn't it? You probably already heard about the festival of... Rebirth. Yeah, I met Dylan. Sounds corny. Maybe it is. But ever since I was old enough to have memories, I've never missed the festival, not once. Hard not to celebrate something this special. From the ashes. From the ashes. So what's it about? - What? - Your documentary. I wouldn't really use that word to describe it. It's more of a character profile. Look... I don't wanna stick my nose into anything, but I am sort of known as the unofficial historian of the Springs Valley. I got a world of knowledge about a speck of land. So if there's anyone you wanna know something about from around here, I am definitely one... Campbell Bradford. You know him? It's getting late, and you got that intern coming in, so good luck, Ms. Shaw. We actually met, like, five years ago, I was at this line for a movie panel thing, and, um, I was actually wearing this cardigan, and, uh, we locked eyes, but you left before I got the chance to... it wasn't 'cause... Sorry that I didn't mention anything about the fandom when I applied to be your intern. I just... I didn't want to creep you out or make things super weird. You were cool with lying though. Omission lies, they're like so not. I'm sorry, but come on. Come on, "Song of the Sick." - "Dead Special." - Okay. "Dead Special: Behind the Scenes." Congrats, you're aware of IMDB. "All The Little Breaks." And you hacked my Vimeo account. - Jesus. - Recognize it? - Why would I recognize... - Milt Staley. "Asleep at the Wheel." How did you get this? Uh, soon as it started streaming, that kid was on eBay selling practically anything that showed up in the doc. I tried to buy his Mustang, but... - that's a pretty cool consolation prize. - It's probably a fake. But it looks real, and it's sharp as fuck, so... I don't mean that... I'm... I am your biggest fan. No, really, I have read every old interview of yours. The way that you talk about process, how projects found you, how they haunted you, how you would channel certain... I mean, people they always get so precious about having some sort of psychic connection- That's not a word I would use. Right, I wasn't... it's always fate. It's always fate. - Oh, God. - Those are your words. You said that shit. I don't even believe in fate or whatever, but us in this moment in a place like this... it kind of makes you believe that everything happens for... - Okay, just get to it. - What? Just get to the part where you asked me what happened. I know what happened. Lonnie Wilkes, "Some Kind of Hell." And there's no way you could've known. No one could've seen that coming. Not even you. After your film got his case overturned, what he did to his family the day he got out. It's not your fault he ended up being a total monster. You chased down that film with everything that you had, and you made something beautiful. You made something beautiful. That was the first thing of yours I'd ever seen. I was 16, and it changed me. It did. Now, anyone can ask, "What happened?" And the real question is, "Was it worth it?" What? Putting yourself out there like that and creating real beauty only to... Lose it all? I still see him. Just him. Sometimes the family. It wakes me up out of a dead sleep. It keeps me up. You almost got an Oscar, though. So? So, what? - So what do you see, like, here? - What do I see? I mean, are you picking up on, like, a certain vibe? Are you getting a certain... A place like this for someone like you, - there's got to be all kind of... - Campbell Bradford. - Who? - I don't know what the story is or the angle, if there even is one, but we definitely don't have anything until we find out who Campbell Bradford is or was when he was... here. That's the job. How hard can that be? Erica? You okay? Erica. Let's go somewhere less here. Really? Google West Baden nightlife. There's like a bar area. Sold. So, we doin' roulette with the old couple or penny slots with the... oh, yeah, that guy is actually dead. Look, I don't wanna to be weird about things, Obviously. Now that we're working together, you know, this is a really big deal for me, collaborating with Erica Shaw. Are you cool with me calling this a collaboration? 'Cause this really feels like a collaboration. I'm definitely getting, like, a collaborative vibe happening. Do you know him? - Who? - The guy you're staring at. - What guy? - But he's walking this way right now. Just so you know, tomorrow, when you regret this, I had no part in any of it. - It's you. - Oh, so this is, like, an established thing? I work at the hotel. I stay at hotel. - Josiah. - Erica. Kellyn. I'm Kellyn, hi. You play Blackjack? Saved a spot for you over here. Cool. That's cool, thanks. Oh wait. So, I don't understand, it's like a movie movie or... It's like a home movie for somebody else's family. And they pay you for that shit? Yeah, it's honest work, sort of. No work is honest if you're doing it for someone else. Cool, so you actually own the hotel. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Yeah, see, you're welcome, set you up perfectly for that. Be something though wouldn't it? What? Owning that place? I don't know. It seems like a lot of work. Can't even keep my apartment clean. - What? - You don't fool me, Erica from Chicago. - Oh, no? - No, you do not. You can sit there, you know, act like you're cool, laid back, but you got it too. The sickness. I can see it in your eyes. What do you mean by that? You want more than you got. I know because I have it too. 'Cause this maintenance thing, I mean, this is, like, a temporary kind of... Look, I've done it all here. I was a bartender. I was a mechanic's apprentice. Blasted limestone for a couple of years. - Oh yeah. - Yeah? Yep, that is a job. Yes, indeed. I... actually, I still got all my gear in the car. You need me to blow up a wall or something. Hey, I might take you up on that one day. You know, it is what it is. Be honest with you, it's the best job I ever had. The world's designed to kick your ass, but you get yourself a drill, a little dynamite... you can be your own force of nature. Yeah. Why'd you give it up? Boss was dick, pay sucked. Besides I always knew that I was meant for bigger shit. World dominance? Yeah. Yeah, why not? I mean, that's right up there on my list of shit to do. I mean, you know, I might start with running a business first, maybe. "Josiah Bradford, Incorporated." Bradford? Well, yeah, I mean, maybe my name goes on there, maybe I make some shit up like Microsoft. Point is, I got plans, okay? A lot bigger than this valley, sure as hell bigger than that hotel. To "Josiah Bradford, Incorporated." So you grew up in West Baden? - What? - You... nothing. What about your family? You guys been here the whole time? My family? Wait, what are we... what are we talking about? Nothing, just... Look, I didn't mean to... Some fuckin' room, right? Yeah. Yeah, everything here's... You know, I've lived here forever. I work at this goddamn place, I've never actually been in one of these rooms. Must be nice. Josiah. I... you know what? I think I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. No, c'mon, stay. Let's have a drink. What's that? Nothing, it's just this thing. Come on, let's have a real drink. Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. Maybe it's just because you've lived here your whole life, but this town... and maybe it's the hotel... it really puts you in a weird place. And anyway, it's nice to talk to somebody who knows what it's like to grow up in a place... Ugh, tastes like shit. Did you just... Cold as fuck, too. You know, you really shouldn't just... Sorry, I didn't mean... Sorry, I didn't mean that. Yeah, maybe you're right. - What? - Maybe you should go. Hey. Hey look, I'm sorry I didn't mean to do... - It's fine. - No, seriously. I said it's fine. What? What is it? Nothing. You should go. - Erica. - Go! Look, Campbell, you're just gonna - have to accept the realities. - Quiet. Excuse me? Excuse me, miss? Wondering if you could help me out. Have you seen him? Wanted for murder, possible kidnap. Still might have that boy with him. Perhaps a closer look will help you. And the thing no one tells you about being detail oriented is that you have to see the big picture first in order to see anything, in order to get anything accomplished. Oh, look who it is. Are we a definite yes on the festival, yet? Oh, I just have to check my schedule. Long night? Excuse me? No, it's just you seem a little... I guess I better get back to my work. It looks like someone needs the water. Sorry? First time guests get a complimentary session in our mineral baths. Now they say the water here is magical for a number of reasons. But first and foremost, it's the perfect hangover cure. Yeah, that sulfur smell lets you know it's the real deal. I mean, the Pluto Water Company started pasteurizing this stuff in the '30s to give it more of a shelf life. Some say that killed the waters magic, but not this stuff, it is straight from the spring. So what do you say? Ready for a rebirth of your own? Maybe some other time. Sure. Sure. The water's certainly not going anywhere. What the fuck, man? Still down here! Something nice about it. The past. Stick around long enough you lose everything you ever loved... but the past is always there fully intact. Perfect. Just waiting for you to come home. Sorry, okay. Yeah, don't suppose I could get you to say that again. - Could I? - Why? I just want to separate you from the wall. - Oh, um, I think we can make it work... - No! And I wanted to make sure I'm getting... I'm old, but I'm not stupid. You didn't come here for local color. You wanna know about Campbell Bradford. If you're not comfortable... That's fine. But you better get the lighting exactly how you want it because I'm sure as hell not say in any of this again. Fair enough. Campbell Bradford, hadn't heard that name for a while. Doesn't seem to fade away though. You knew him? Well, not personally. My daddy did though. Talked about him like the boogeyman or something worse. 'Cause he was real. Why can't I find any info about him or his family? The Bradfords... the ones around here anyway... never could catch much luck in the longevity department. Only one I can even think of is his great-grandson... Josiah. We've met. Yeah. Kid's been a mess his whole life, Can't blame him, I guess. Considering... Considering what? Well, having a man like Campbell in your line... can't imagine. He made his name in blood. My daddy wouldn't even look me in the eye when he'd talk about him. But he still talked about him. Why? Certain stories, they just refuse to die. No one could touch him. Not the law, not anyone. He thought the town was his. Couldn't get the hotel though. The owner refused to sell it to him. Didn't think Campbell was worthy of a place so perfect. Special. So Campbell killed him, beat the owner to death right in front of the man's only child. Then he just took the boy. Sheriff went looking for him after that, but Campbell killed him too. Even had someone from the FBI come down from Chicago. So Campbell finally skipped town for good, right after burning him alive. Found that Fed's body in a pile of ash along the river bank, but all they ever found of that child... was his violin. You okay, dear? Mm-hmm. Suppose that's Campbell Bradford in a nutshell. Kind of person so evil, you get them in your head, you start seeing him everywhere. It's a miracle this hotel... this town survived him at all. Maybe they didn't. What? Campbell's alive. Barely, but I've met him. But that's not possible. The years and his age, and it's not... - Okay, maybe we should take a little break. - I've met him, Anne. He's with us for now. I really don't mean to press here. I'd be careful, I were you. What do you mean by that? If you don't know by now, you will. Maybe he's changed. - Changed? - Maybe he found love for God, or... At my age, one of the only things I know for sure is that people, they don't change. Just become more of what they really are. I get that, I do. I'm just asking you to keep an open mind. Yeah, and I know that it's your father, but you're the one who wanted to know the truth about the story. You're the one who wanted to know... No I understand, I'm not stupid. Of course. It's just... okay, all right. The people around here, when you mentioned the name Campbell Bradford, they... I'm sure you were hoping for a different version of this story, but this is it. This is the... I'm telling you, this is so much bigger than anything you can imagine. No, you're not hearing me. The most important thing is for everybody to know the truth. That's the most important thing. And you could have hired anybody. You could have hired some hack, but you called me because you wanted... you wanted to know... What? This woman. Okay, yeah. So you're gonna come down here and what? You're going to rip the camera out of my hands? No, I don't... honey, I don't give a shit about the rest of the money. This is my story now, too. And nobody, especially not some North Shore bitch, is gonna stop me from getting... Fucking entitled... That fuck has a family in Chicago? I'm sorry, I should have told you as soon as I knew who you were. - And he's still alive? - Yeah. Yeah, he's got days left, if that, but he's still... - Josiah... - What's he like? He's... old and frail and... Honestly, it's hard to imagine him as... Pure evil? Yeah. This guy, this piece of shit monster, he terrorizes this place long before my time then he just bails. Starts over. Pretends it didn't happen. Well, he fucked up the whole lot of us like every branch of the goddamn family tree was just snapped in half. And I'm the only one still here. Yeah. Why? The Campbell curse. They said that shit like it was a joke. You know? Definitely wouldn't mind a few minutes alone with the guy. Hop a bus to Chicago. Tell him to fuck off. Maybe worse. At least he made a name for himself though, right? Heard he almost bought this place back in the day, and here I am fixin' it up for ten bucks an hour. You don't think you're worth more than that? Do you? Maybe you can. What? Tell him to fuck off. - You alright? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You got this. - Yeah. Be ready. You got somethin' prepared, or... Just be ready. Okay. Let's start with your name and how you're related to Campbell Bradford. Uh, my name is, uh... Do... am I lookin' at the camera? Just look at me. Just a conversation. Easy. Relax. My name is Josiah Bradford. Campbell was... is my great-grandfather. And how, would you say, is your relationship with Campbell? Well, I've never... I mean, no, I never... we already talked about... - I know. I just need it for context. - Oh sorry, uh... - It's alright. How would you say is your relationship with Campbell? Never met him. I mean, ran off and left his wife and daughter long before I was even... Is this even, I mean... they're not gonna wanna hear me say this shit. Doesn't matter what they want. What do you want to say? Why I... this doesn't really... - Say it. - What are you... - Say it. - Fuck him! Fuck Campbell Bradford. How's that? - Why? - Why? - Are you alright? - What? - You seem a little... - No, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh... - You know, a little weird with the camera. - Is that it? Wha... what do you want? I mean, I don't... I just... I do this for a living so I can tell the difference between somebody who's camera shy and somebody that's scared. The hell's that supposed to mean? It means I think you're scared of this man that you've never met, and I'm curious as to why that would be. - I ain't scared of shit. - Your hands are shaking. - Your voice has an unsettled quality about it. - Erica, maybe we could keep... I don't know why your body tenses up every time I say the words - "Campbell Brad..." - Because he killed them. - Killed who? - Everyone. My mom, she OD'd when I was in high school. Sophomore year. Spring. It rained that day, I remember that. Her mom, my grandma, died that summer. It was an accident. Accidentally stepped in front of a train. Who does that shit? Ugh, goddamn Bradfords. An aunt I never met stole grandma's car when she was like 12. Drove it off a bridge. You know, by mistake, of course. My mom's brother, Uncle Ross, funny as shit. Drunk as shit, too, choked on his own vomit one night 'bout 10 years ago. Yep, that shit really happens not just to famous people. His two kids, both my cousins, got caught up in some shit with the wrong people... not that they were the right people, necessarily, but never murdered anyone as far as I know. Found one of 'em shot dead in his living room. Other got his in prison. Alright, uh... Anyone else wanna smoke? I thought you said Campbell killed 'em. Just me? Sounds like bad decisions or bad luck maybe, but I don't know if I would call it... I'm pretty sure you can't smoke in here. Yeah, right. Um, right, I'm just gonna step out... Does that comfort you? Excuse me? Putting your family's mistakes and problems on a man you've never met, - is that fair? - What the fuck is this? - No, no. I'm sorry... - You know, this isn't what you said we were gonna be doing, acting like all this shit is on me. - Turn the camera off. - Let's just talk. No, we just wanna... - Turn that shit off. - Alright. Yep. Okay, it's off. It's off. Shit, sorry. Um... Can we just talk, just you and me? What the fuck just happened here? I'm sorry. It... can you please sit down so we... - You just want to talk? - Yeah. Okay, so... these things can get heated, and it's easy to get caught up in moments. And... but can I just tell you? Can I tell you how brave I think you are? What you're doing right now. Listen, it's easy to make me the bad guy and feel like I'm pushing you in directions that you don't want to go, but think... think about it. Think about where you were going before I got here, before you were willing to deal with this monster... and what he's done to your family. Family's dead. But you're not. You're still here. And you're gonna be alright. You're gonna fuckin' survive this. Unless, of course, you keep selling yourself this story that your family's cursed instead of taking responsibility for your actions. "Campbell Curse," is that what you called it? I mean, it sounds more like a Bradford problem to me. Bradford problems. - Yeah. - I like that. It's like the whole nature nurture thing. Are we born pieces of shit or do we pick that up from our surroundings? I'm not trying to imply that... You're tryin' to say I'm stuck here because of... Shit town, shit job... I ain't tryin' to put that on Campbell. I fuck up. Yeah, secret's out. I could've found a girl. Had some good ones, but I always wanted the others, the ones just out of reach. Could've learned a real trade, make five times what I'm makin' now, but there's no way that I am gonna look in the mirror every day, come to terms with the fact that I'm just a... plumber... mechanic. I didn't quit that blastin' job. They fired my ass. Real professional discourtesy, if you ask me. You see, I kept stealin' materials, takin' 'em home at night. I wanted to try out some more innovative ways of turnin' walls into rubble, force of god damn nature. You rig that shit just right, one call from one of these, that's all you need to take down an entire building. That's right. I can do more damage with this phone than a full demolition crew. So how am I supposed to sit there with some old ass detonator, goggles, hard hat and shit, some goddamn grunt when I know there's a better way? You know what that's like? Feelin' greatness in your bones, getting so close... knowin' it's right there... knowin' damn well you deserve it. So, yeah... ain't tryin' to blame my "Bradford problems" on anyone but me. But the curse... Campbell's only real gift to the family, well that's in the blood. What? Death. When you have it runnin' through you, you just know. What the fuck? Josiah. Josiah. Josiah. What, uh... If you need a moment, we can... Uh. Josiah. Uh, what... What just happened? Put that on the laptop. Uh. Okay, but didn't that seem a little... You wanted to know how this was done. You wanted to know how I make something beautiful. You want in on the process? This is how it's done. Let me know when you're finished. His daddy should have sold me that hotel when he had the chance. They say if you ain't built for greatness... you best not mess with it. Hello? Someone in here? Ain't no curse. That's a gift. Who the fuck are you? Oh, you know... My blood. My name. Only good things you have. You can't run from what you are. You sure as hell can't run from me. Campbell? Who are you? We need to talk. Holy shit. He speaks. Pardon my a... Why don't you tell me about the town? West Baden, is it? Hmm, why would you want to disappear? Can we go back? I'm a little confused, why would you be hiding? - I don't understand what... - Oh, it gets better. What about this? Does this mean anything to you? Whose name? Well, your daughter gave it to me, she... I can't tell if you're crazy or full of shit. Kellyn. I kinda have my money on both right now. Yeah. Ever since I started drinking the water... - The what? - The water in that bottle that I got from the woman who hired me. - Jesus Christ. - It's been strange. It's different than the usual glimpse from the past that I get. It's like every time I take a drink, the past comes here to me. - It's... - It's probably giardia. No, it's not. This is what we've been working toward. No. No. God, look at you. We are so close to finding out about Campbell. All we need is one last piece, that perfect image is just gonna tie everything together. That's what we need. We just need a little more time. Hey, this is real. This is... If I'm crazy right now then everything I've ever done, all the work that... that changed your life, all the work that you love then that's all bullshit too. - Never meet your heroes. - Oh, come on! Come on! Okay, people always talk about the darkness in your films, Erica. This bleak, violent horror shit. It was never the darkness that drew me in, though. God, I had enough of that in my day to day already. The shit I'd seen, I probably could've been one of your subjects... No. No, it wasn't the darkness, it was how you made your way through it. You stood in the middle of some of the most fucked up lives, and you refused to look away, to even blink. You showed me something that I knew, but I couldn't see myself. Your work... it didn't change my life... - it saved it. - Well good... Okay, with all due respect to your process or whatever, I think you need to go - find someone to talk... - No, no, no, you don't understand. - You don't understand. - No, I don't! Something horrible is gonna happen here. - How can you possibly know that? - Lonnie Wilkes. What? What the hell are you even talking... The whole time I was working with him, I knew people were gonna die, - and I never did anything... - Okay, you got played by a sociopath. - You cannot carry that... - I knew that he was guilty. I mean, face to face, I bought it like everybody else did, but... but every so often, I would see it. He played the part. But I knew. I knew exactly what he was. And, um... it... it just... it just worked better if he didn't do it. My involvement, the way the film made real-life change. That was the story. But his family, his... I know, I know, I know. I know. I know people died because I walked away from the truth. I can't ever do that again. That's why I can't ever do that again. Unless it makes for a better ending, right? Do you really think you would've done something different? If... if you were that close to something you've wanted your whole life? You could taste it. You really think you'd be able to do the right thing? No. That's why I am leaving. No! Oh! You want to know about me? Now you know. You brought me here. You did this. Erica? Erica? Hey. Erica. Wha... what the hell are you doing? - He's here, he's here. - Who's here? Out cold. Shame she'll be missing tonight's festivities. The Rebirth thing? Sounds like some bullshit to me. If you lived here, you'd understand. Yeah, if I lived here, I'd leave. Sorry, I... I know you... Just something about this place. Somethin' about every place. But you didn't see her last night. I mean, either she's completely lost it or... Or what? She says he's here now. Who? Oh. Just tell me that she's crazy, that I'm crazy for even thinkin' that this is actually, you know... - What do you see? - What? Well, look around. What do you see? - What are you... - Go on. Do it. I see a... a building. A building. People... getting ready for a party. Little-ass sandwiches on trays. What exactly am I supposed to be... I see a town... refusing to let anything... anyone... keep it down. What do you think she sees? So, which one of us is right? Hi, how are you? Yes. Hey guys! Hey guys, don't worry, you... It's 10 after, let's go. From the ashes! From the ashes! Erica? Erica? Oh, Jesus! You can't just sneak up on a person like... Oh, glad to see you decided to join us this evening. This is a fun interpretation of "formal attire." Uh, have you seen Erica? Miss Shaw? No, not since last night's incident. Not everyone takes to the water, I suppose, - but I really thought... - The water, the fucking water. No, no! The pool is closed for the festival! You probably shouldn't go in there! They'll all be dead before you get 'em to stop dancin'. Run now. You'll probably make it out. Kellyn? You really believe all that shit? What? Campbell and everything... that he actually... - What happened with Josiah... - Yeah, I do. - I mean, what you think? - I don't think that you can just become a monster... not without having some of that in you to begin with. - Well, Josiah was... - Give me the phone, Erica. - What? - Josiah's phone. Please. Why? What does this have to do with... Give me the phone! Listen... I have the camera set up outside. It's just one shot, but it's one big wide shot of the whole place. And I really think we should get it before we ruin these people's festival. I mean, my God, it's gonna be local news and cops and it's just... it's kind of hard to keep the music going after something like this. I really think it's a shot I've been... we've been trying to... I really think we have something here. I know. I know we've been through hell. We've been through hell here. Just trust me, please. Can you just trust me? Just this once. It's gonna be okay. Alright. Just imagine the story we'll have to tell once this whole thing is over. Your mine now, boy. But you will never have my blood or my name.
