Don't worry. The show is not over yet. I just had to go and change into something a little bit more... sparkly! Are you having fun yet? How you doing tonight, Reflections section and beyond? Listen! Guys, we need to have a heart-to-heart. Hold on, hold on. Listen to me, listen to me. Listen to me! We need to talk about something a little bit serious. I don't mean to be a bummer or anything. I know you guys came here with the intention of just having a great old time, but I need to get serious with you. We need to talk about a disease that is spreading across the world right now. Maybe some of you have been affected by it. Maybe... shh. Simmer down now. Maybe some of your family members are affected by it. Maybe you yourself is affected by it. But this disease has hit our world in a big way. It's called the disease of selfie-ing! Yes, you heard correctly. Selfie-ing is a disease. Now, how many of you... Let's be honest. How many of you tonight came to the show... Whether in the car or on the train or on the bus, whatever... But the whole time you were on your way here, all you were doing was selfie-ing? Some people are jumping up and down like it's something to be proud of. Listen. Shh! Okay, hold on, hold on. Every once in a while, even though I truly believe selfie-ing is a disease, every once in a while, I think, why not make an exception for these people... These people that have these signs here tonight. I could just break the rules one time... Whatever I believe... Just for one night. You. Pizza lady. Get up here on the stage right now. No, no, no! Bring that watermelon purse. Do not leave that watermelon purse on the floor. Hurry! You weren't quite sure that 15,000-plus people were gonna see you in this pizza bathing suit, were you? No, not at all. You look very "This is How We Do." See, listen, I appreciate when people dress up, when they have a little fun. Where's your cell phone? Is it in your watermelon purse? I hope it is. Here you go. What's your password? 1-3-0-3. 1-3-0-3? You ready for an "ussie"? Yes. That's what we're gonna call it. That's how we're gonna bend the rules tonight. We're gonna call it an "ussie." It's no longer a "selfie," 'cause when two people are in the picture, it's an "ussie." You solemnly swear that you will put a fantastic filter on this, right? There you go. That's what you get for wearing a pizza bathing suit. How you doing down here? Are there any Katy Kats in the building tonight? So, I dedicate this next song to the Katy Kats... for keeping me propped up. It's called "By the Grace of God." # (BY THE GRACE OF GOD) # # Was 27 surviving my return of Saturn # # A long vacation didn't sound so bad # # Was full of secrets locked up tight like Iron Mountain # # Running on empty so out of gas # # Thought I wasn't enough # # Found I wasn't so tough # # Laying on the bathroom floor # # We were living on a fault line # # And I felt the fault was all mine # # Couldn't take it anymore # # By the grace of God # # There was no other way # # I picked myself back up # # I knew I had to stay # # I put one foot in front of the other # # And I looked in the mirror # # And decided to stay # # Wasn't gonna let love take me out # # That way # (shouting and cheering) # I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water # # When the truth was like swallowing sand # # Now every morning oh there is no more mourning # # Oh I can finally see myself again # # I know I am enough # # Possible to be loved # # It was not about me # # Now I have to rise above # # Let the Universe call the bluff # # 'Cause the truth will set you free # # And by the grace of God # # There was no other way # # I picked myself back up # # I knew I had to stay # # I put one foot in front of the other # # And I # # Looked in the mirror # # And decided to stay # # Wasn't gonna let love take me out # # That way, no # # That way # # That way # # That way, no # # Not in # # The name of love # # That way, no # # That way, no # # I am not giving up # # No # # By the grace of God # # I picked myself back up # # I put one foot in front of the other # # And I looked in the mirror # # Looked in the mirror # Come on! # Looked in the mirror # # Looked in the mirror # # By the grace of God # # There was no other way # # Yeah I picked myself back up # # I knew I had to stay # # I put one foot in front of the other # # And I # # Looked in the mirror # # And decided to stay # # Wasn't gonna let love # # Take me out # # That way ## Thank you! Thank you. So, I'm from a little place called California. Has anyone ever been to Cali-for-ni-ay? I'm so green lately that actually I have a garden at home. Isn't that cool? It's very trendy, isn't it? Is it the most boringest... Am I the most boringest pop star you've ever met? Don't answer that! But I can tell you what I've been able to grow in my garden if you're really curious. I know you're desperately curious for this. No, no, no. I'll tell you anyways. Okay, so I've been able to grow chives, sugar snap peas, heirloom tomatoes, kale. Oh, yes, got to grow kale. Kale is like the Beyonc? of all vegetables. Don't forget it. I do not grow that, whoever yelled that obscenity. Is that even legal here? No? Well, then, I don't grow it especially. And if I'm honest, I get really paranoid and I sit in a corner for eight hours, if you know what I'm talking about. Some of you don't know what I'm talking about. I digress. The whole reason I'm talking about my garden right now is because, actually, I always bring something on tour from home that makes me not so homesick anymore, and weirdly enough, I've decided this time around I'd bring my garden, and I've just grown some beautiful sunflowers... with help from my handsome scarecrows. And I thought to myself, what if I just water my garden one more... One last time? What will I grow? I think I grew a pizza! Shh! Oh. Holy pie. I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak. Listen. Can I just be honest with you? I need to be honest with you. I have an overshare for one second. Is that okay? I'm talking to 15,000 people, but I don't care. Listen, sometimes when you get older, not too older, but sometimes when you get older, your body changes. And one day, you wake up for your regular scheduled appointment with your Chinese medicine doctor and he says, "You're allergic to gluten!" No! I don't even know what gluten is. It's like a new trend word, kale, gluten. What are they gonna think of next? But I heard it's in this pizza, so I can no longer eat pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner as I used to. Anybody want this pizza? I need somebody to eat this pizza for me! You. With the big eyes. I know exactly how you feel. Do you want to come on stage? You want this pizza? Well, then come on stage and get this pizza right now. Shh! Small child, coming on the stage, be kind. She lost a shoe like Cinderella. Maybe she really is a princess. What big eyes you have, my dear. Thank you. You're welcome. You've been brought up right. What's your name? Elise. Elise. How old are you, Elise? Eight years old. My goodness. Eight years old. That's really... That's, like, a big deal. Like, at nine years old, I started to sing. Do you sing? No. Oh, that's good, I'm not threatened anymore. There's not room for us all. Now, Elise, you are so pretty, with your golden hair to match your golden shirt. And I know you are so smart, 'cause you're gonna answer these next two questions so correctly, therefore, you're gonna win this pizza and you're gonna feed all your friends and family. (audience cheers) It's a great thing to provide at eight years old. Okay, are you ready? Can you answer these questions? Are you a little bit nervous? I don't know. I don't know, either. Sometimes I really don't know how to feel, either. Very confused. Okay, first and foremost, let's look out for your health. Elise, with the beautiful big, brown eyes, are you allergic to gluten? No. Wait for it. Good. Last question, very important. Please answer this correctly. I'll have to pause the show if you don't. Who's your favorite singer? Katy Perry. Yeah! Elise! Elise, I'm so glad, I thought you were gonna say that other girl. Elise, here is your beautiful pizza pie. You gonna go share it with your friends and family? Yes. Just remember one thing, Elise. Your body changes. So this next song goes out to all the pizzas I can no longer properly digest. I'm never gonna get a boyfriend! J/K. It's called "The One That Got Away." # (THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY) # # Summer after high school when we first met # # We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead # # And on my 18th birthday # # We got matching tattoos # # Used to steal your parents' liquor # # And climb to the roof # # Talk about our future like we had a clue # # Never planned on one day # # I'd be losing you # # In another life I would be your girl # # We'd keep all our promises # # Be us against the world # # In another life I would make you stay # # So I don't have to say # # You were the one that got away # # The one that got away # # I was June and you were my Johnny Cash # # Never one without the other we made a pact # # Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on # # Woo # # Someone said you had your tattoo removed # # Saw you downtown singing the blues # # It's time to face the music # # I'm no longer your muse # # In another life # # I would be your girl # # We'd keep all our promises # # Be us against the world # # In another life # # I would make you stay # # So I don't have to say # # You were the one that got away # # 'Cause when I'm with him # # I am thinking of you # # Thinking of you # # What you would do if # # You were the one # # Who was spending the night # # Oh I wish that I # # Was looking into your eyes # # When I'm with him # # I am thinking of you # # Thinking of you # # What you would do if # # You were the one # # Who was spending the night # # Oh I wish that I # # Was looking into your # # 'Cause all this money can't buy me a time machine # # No # # Can't replace you with a million rings # # No # # I should have you told you what you meant to me # # Woo # # 'Cause now I pay the price # Sing it! # In another life # # I would be your girl # # We'd keep all our promises # # Be us against the world # # In another life # # I would make you stay # # So I don't have to say # # You were the one that got away # # The one that got away # # The one, the one # # The one # # The one # # In another life # # 'Cause when I am with him # # I am thinking of you # # Thinking of you # # Thinking of you ## Thank you! So I want to dedicate this next song tonight to all of you here tonight. And for anybody that's watching, thank you for supporting me through my journey. I hope I get to do this for the rest of my life and I hope that you are there every step of the way! I love you unconditionally! Now, if you've got a light on your phone, turn it on.
