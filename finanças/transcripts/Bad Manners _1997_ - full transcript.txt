This morning when you were in the shower. - You had a fifty on you? - As it happens, I did. - My fifty? - Don't be silly. Not your fif--your fifty is lost or you left it at home. It's just you were going on and on about it being stolen that I just-- I had to put your mind at ease. - By patronizing me? - Patronizing? How am I patronizing? - Treating me like a bird-brained adolescent who needs her mittens pinned to her. - Well, if the shoe fits. - Fuck you! - I'm not patro-- Could you--could you please stay out of this, you? - She accused Wes and me of being thieves in our home. - I--I know. I--she--she was wrong. She was very upset. - I can speak for myself, Matt. - Then speak for yourself. Apologize. - Don't give me orders. You're not my father. - I stole your money. And I apologize. I don't know what came over me. I have some mad felicity, something, a devil-may-care whimsy. No, I really don't know. But, anyway, you have your money back. Matt here gave you your money back, and I'm fifty dollars richer. I'll go buy Nancy some flowers with it. She'll give them to Matt as a token of friendship, and Matt might give them to you. We'll all be happy. - And keep up the pretense that all is well and everyone's happy, and, hey, let's have another round of cocktails? Is it really so important to keep a placid surface on your lives? - The only thing disturbing the placid surface of my life is you. - Is that so? Otherwise everything's fine in your waxworks world of dead composers and aboriginal religions? Is that why your husband's been coming at me like a dog smelling estrus? - Kim, for Christ's sake! - You know, you may think maintaining good manners to be only so much hypocrisy, and civility a veneer covering an unexamined and bankrupt life. But for the sake of counting yourself among civilization's discontents, to accuse us of thievery, to pass comment on the value of our lives together, and to compare my husband to a rutting hound, that is indefensible. It is also gutless, shameless, and contemptible. - Yeah, well... what if it's true? ♪ music playing - If Matt put a fifty in her suitcase and ours is still there, it's like she's getting interest. - Shut up, Wes. - Oh Jesus! Oh, I--I didn't see you. Why--why didn't you say anything? - I wanted to watch. See if you'd do something peculiar. - Like what? - Oh, I don't know. Breakdance. Suck your teeth. - Interesting. - Or throw yourself on this chair and land on me instead. - You been here long? When did you come back? - An hour, I'd guess about an hour. - Does Matt know you're back. - I don't know. If he does, he doesn't want to talk. Is there anything to drink? - Well, yes. - Could you get me something? Some scotch? - Quite a show you put on. - A show? - I'm not implying that you were insincere of course. - Of course. You don't seem too upset. - You know how it is, heat and rut. My emotions are skewed. - Yeah. Well, I suppose I owe you an apology. - You guess. You're not sure? - I'm not good at it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said about you or Nancy. - You can tell Nancy that. - That was amazing what she said to me. - Amazing? - She hadn't been talking to me, I'd have felt like applauding. - You do know that I know. - Know what? - The fifty dollars. - Please. Don't bring that up again. Tomorrow, if you have to. - All right. But you will admit that you do know that I know. - You're being a bore. - I am a bore. I lead a placid life. - You said you wanted me. You said you wanted me to say yes to you. - Yes. I said, "you do know that I know, "and I wanted you to say yes. - I said yes. Right answer to the wrong question? What I think is you want to fuck me and now you're here, and you're too chickenshit to go through with it. Am I wrong? - Morning. - Oh, hi. You been up long? - A while. An hour maybe. - What time's your meeting? - Eleven. Sleep okay? - Yeah, you? - No, actually I didn't. - What's the matter? You're not feeling well? - No, I'm not. I'm--not feeling terribly well at all. - Is this about Kim? I heard her, at some point. - Yeah, well, I'd be surprised if you hadn't. - Why? Was she loud? - Well, she wasn't exactly yelling, if that's what you mean. - I don't think I mean anything. - You don't think you do? Christ Nancy, can you never say anything without equivocating? - Now, what's the matter? Did you have a fight? - No, look, um, I think the best thing will be first to get out of here. We can get a--I can get a hotel. You really have been more than gracious. - Matt. - And I really appreciate it. It's just I can't stay here any longer. - Matt, I'm--I'm not asking you to leave. - Well, maybe you should. Maybe you should do exactly that. - I didn't take it personally. She's young. She's smart and arrogant and high-strung. So was I at her age. So were you. - Oh, for Christ's sake, will you stop being so fucking noble? She's a deceitful little slut. I am humiliated being associated with her, let alone bringing her into your home. - Well, if that's the way you feel, I-- - The way I feel? The way I feel? You think this is only about me? - I said I didn't take it personally. - She fucked your husband. - What did you say? - Last night. In your own living room, all right? - You saw this? - I heard them. - You bastard. - What? - You simpering coward. You're pathetic. And you use your self-pity the way another man would use drink, to dredge up the shriveled sack of gall that passes for you as guts. - What are you talking about? - She's too strong for you, and too independent, and you can't deal with it. And since you don't have the guts to hurt her, you try to hurt me and blame it on her. Shame on you! - She fucked your husband! - I won't hear it! - She fucked your husband! - Not in my house! Do you hear me? - Jesus, Nancy! What's going on? - Why don't you ask him? - No! - Ask me what? - Nothing. Nothing at all! - And you call me gutless? - It's not true! - Well, then ask him! - What is going on? - Ask him. - No! - You want me to ask him? - According to you, there's nothing to ask. You know. You heard. So, you just tell him. Just tell him. - I heard you and Kim last night. - Yes? So? - You were with her? - Yes, I was. - What are you saying? - What do you mean? - What are you saying? What were you doing with her? - Not much. I came down here to get some juice, since she was here we talked a little while. Would someone please tell me what this is all about? - Well, Matt says that ah, you... - You're lying. - I'm lying? I'm lying? Haha. Do you mind if I get some coffee? What--what are you saying? Are you--if you're accusing me of something, just say it. - I--I'm not... - Just say it! You called me a liar you fucking moron! - I heard you. I heard you fu--you were having intercourse with Kim last night. - You heard me. Heard me? What did you hear? My voice? No, please, tell me. A gnashing friction, the lubricous, suctioned pop of the act itself? - You know damn well. I heard you, and I heard Kim. - You don't believe this crap, do you? - No. - What? Why? Why would I make it up for God's sake? - Oh, yes, that is the question. - I told you why. - How can you believe that? - Believe what? Good morning. - Morning. It seems your boyfriend here heard us screwing on the living room couch. - Really? As if I hadn't done enough already. - He says he heard you. He heard your voice. - Do you believe that? It's, of course, completely, totally untrue. - You're denying it, then? Both of you? - Nothing took place last night. - Nothing took place last night. That's your position, then? I mean, and your position is what, that I'm lying, I'm--I was dreaming, I'm delusional? - I don't know what to think. - What do you think you heard, Matt? - I heard you. - What was I saying? - You were saying--you were making sounds of passion, and I heard--I heard you, you were cumming. - How would you know what I sound like when I cum? - You are a bitch. - I'm relieved you don't believe him. I'd just as soon not admit this, but I'm afraid if I don't, you may come to wonder about-- I mean he's not delusional, and he says he heard us, and...I don't quite know how to say this. - What? - I was masturbating. - Oh Jesus Christ! - That's what he heard. - Well, I guess that's a relief. This was after you went to bed, I assume. - Uh, yes. I'm afraid so. I guess her seeing me in my robe, she just couldn't restrain herself. - God, I'm so embarrassed. - We're all adults here. We're familiar with the exercise. I just hope, as your host, that you found everything you needed in the kitchen. - So that's what this is, then? A joke? Her playing with herself, that's the punch line, I'm the butt? - Well, you're the one that went off half-cocked, telling me I cheated on my wife, calling me a liar. You better me goddamn grateful we're treating this as a joke. - Yeah. Well, I've got an appointment. This isn't over. I'm not a liar, and I won't be set up as one. [BELLS TOLLING] - Dr. Harper? - Oh, hi Mr. Carroll. - Yes. - Do come in. - Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm so happy to meet you finally. - Oh, thank you. - I'm such an admirer of the Journal. - Oh good. Sit down, please. - Okay, thank you. I have--I have my-- - Let me get right to the point. Oh, can I offer you some tea? - Uh, no thanks. - Oh. I'm having some. Are--are you sure I can't interest you in some? - No, I'm fine, thanks. - It's wild cherry. Mm! I love wild cherry. Do you like wild cherry? - I--I don't know. Uh, chamomile I like sometimes. - I find that chamomile gives me gastric distress. Um, I read your article last week, and I had my colleagues look it over too. It was ah...very interesting. - Thank you very much. Thank you very much. - Mr. Carroll, we are not going to publish the article. - Because Schumann himself is a fascinating subject to-- What do you mean you're not going to publish? What do you mean? - Well, it's the opinion of the editorial board that we cannot publish an article that maintains, such as your article maintains, without the risk of, I--I think it's more certainty than risk, of making the Journal, and, with it, the entire discipline of musicology, an academic laughingstock. I mean, suppose, uh, we agreed that there's no hoax. - Right. - Well, what then? Computer consciousness? Luther's spirit alive in the silicon? We are--we are musicologists, Mr. Carroll, not card readers. - Well the fact remains, Dr. Harper, the quote is there. It's there. - Well, let me ask you this. It has nothing to do with the--this matter, really, but it's out of curiosity. Um, what do you think about this? - What do you mean? When I first learned of it? Well, I don't know. I--I accepted it. There it was. It's not anything to build a church to, and it's not to be taken as a sign of something, but it happened. It happened. For months afterwards, I kind of walked around with a big grin on my face. Ha! Do you know what I'm saying? - That's charming. Nevertheless, the quote was found by a computer? - Yes, Kim ran a series of programs through the piece to try to seek out non-random patterns. - That's Ms. Matthews? - Yes. What? What about Ms. Matthews? - Do you know her well? - It's funny, though, isn't it? - What's funny? - You did what I did. Neither of us believed him. You chose to disbelieve Matt and to believe Wes and me. - I don't think I believed or disbelieved. Your explanation answered Matt's question. Not to mention a knowledge of my husband that makes Matt's accusation impossible. - Belief, not knowledge. - Fine, belief. - And this belief keeps you from considering that your husband could make love to me in your living room and then join me in lying to cover it up. - Yes, it does. - Although, if the first were true, the second would be more likely too, wouldn't it? - No, I don't think so. If I were foolish enough to risk my marriage by having an affair, I would not aggravate it by lying. - Really? Well, in a game most people with one foot in the shit will go double or nothing. - Well, as so happens, I do not have one foot in the shit. And we are not playing a game. - Really? - What does she feel about the quote? Does she believe the computer did it? - She thinks I think that's possible. - Oh, she thinks, you think--Really, Mr. Carroll, well, look, I don't mistrust you, and I--I'd rather not see your reputation tarnished, but this is a crock of shit. - How? What do you mean? How do you--? - I mean somebody has done this. - It's--it's a hoax, pure and simple. - It's not possible. It's just not possible. We worked on copies only. We never even touched the original. What? What? - Look, I was told at MIT that the checking software could have been written to alter what it checked. Even the original could have been changed. - Are you accusing Ms. Matthews of--Well, what about Schumann? I mean, it's possible Schumann, Schumann could have-- he could have been-- - Mr. Carroll, we are not going to publish your research, and your credibility as a scholar is breached. Yours and Ms. Matthews. - Are you saying that's what happened? - Why don't you ask him? - Do you think I'm afraid to? - Nancy. She's toying with you. - And what about you, Wes? - What? - Don't insult me. - Oh. What are you saying? That you believe him? That you believe her? Hm? - You tell me it isn't true. You. I don't want to hear some confection that you and this little thief agreed upon. - Thief? You're calling me a thief now? - Actually, I'm quoting. Wes thinks you stole fifty dollars from his wallet. - Nancy! - He's been quite obsessed with it. - Really? - And with you too, apparently. - Don't do this. - Why not? We're all getting things off our chests. Go ahead. Come clean. - Go ahead, Wes. - All right, you both want this? - Last night I came in here. I--I was awake. I was going to make a drink or something, and she was here, sitting in the dark. I didn't know it. She didn't say anything at first. She started talking about what happened earlier. Apologizing. I could smell that she'd been drinking. She was physically loose, presumptuous, and crude, so she came on to me. I have no reason to deny it. She even kissed me, but I felt no attraction for her so I went back to bed as quickly as possible. So much for my obsession. As for the other thing, yes, I do think you stole fifty dollars from me and that you are a damn thief. - You've gone a little far, haven't you? - That from you? - Talk about protesting too much. - I'm sick of your damn voice. - For the record, he did make love to me last night. - I did not. - Uh, Doctor--hi guys. - Dr. Harper has been looking at our research at Harvard and at the electronic music lab at MIT, and the Luther quote, ha! It's a hoax. A pure and simple hoax. - What? - What? You sound a little surprised. - What's that supposed to mean? Of course I'm surprised. - The piece was altered by a subprogram in your software. That is to say that you deliberately tampered with Schumann's work. - That's not true. - So this little prank, I don't know, whatever it was, that cost us about a year or maybe a year and a half of very hard work, it's all garbage now. And also means that your career is finished and maybe you're facing civil, maybe criminal charges. I sure hope it was worth it. - I didn't tamper with Schumann's work. - Oh, you didn't? Oh, well well, the thing is that it's not really my affair anymore. But the truth is that they say they can prove it, and I have no reason to doubt it. - Me? Me? I'm your reason. I'm saying it isn't true. - Yeah. If I were you, I'd--my advice to you would be to confess, and then I would get medical attention. - Your advice? - Mhm. - You think I'm crazy? - No, I think that someone whose career is in jeopardy as the result of a willful and self-destructive act would not hurt her situation any by admitting it straight away and seeking treatment. And I can tell you that I think Dr. Harper feels almost exactly the same way. - Fuck you and fuck that. This is bullshit. There is no proof. There can't be. I didn't do it. - I can't say that I expected you really to behave reasonably about this. - And you, Matt? You believed her? - Well, why shouldn't I? I'm no computer expert, really. - Because you believed me, that's why. Because you know I wouldn't do that. The quote was there. - Yeah, just like your fifty bucks. - You bastard. You weak fucking bastard. You see what you've done? - What we've done? - You caused this. - I? - You had the vulgar audacity to suspect me of stealing money from you. How dare you? - You invite those suspicions. You court them with your incessant game-playing. As you like it. So don't throw it at us. - Oh? Well, forget suspicions. Try facts. He did fuck me last night. - Well, that's enough! - And he wasn't playing games! - Stop! - What went on in that meeting? It's a set-up isn't it? Harper wouldn't publish the article, and she designated me as the reason, and you agreed. Isn't it? - No. - A fucking set-up! - No, it isn't. - You sold me out, and you don't even have the guts to admit it. [CRYING] - Bye bye. - Hi. - Hi, honey. - You okay? - Yeah. - You can be reconsidered you know? For tenure? And we're fine. Financially. - Yeah, I was thinking, this spring I might do something back here. - Sure. - Build something, maybe. From wood. - That sounds manly. Build something from wood. With tools. From your shop. Like what? Like a fence? - Hm. A fe--yeah, a fence. Just run a fence right across the lawn. - Well, like what? An arbor maybe? - No, I was thinking of an outhouse. Or maybe a bomb shelter. - Bomb shelter's good. Or a 7-11? Make some money while you're at it. - Mhm. - Or a Cineplex, better yet. "Wes? No, he's out back, building a Cineplex from wood. With tools." Do you have any tools? Seriously? - Yes, I have tools. - Now, what do you--what? - I have-- - Yeah? - A snow shovel, and I have a stapler. - A snow shovel and a stapler. Well, you could bury the stapler under the piles of paper on your desk, and then come spring, you can dig it out.
