(light music) - [Narrator] The following dramatization is based on court documents, published accounts, and interviews, and is told from the perspective of Sonia Jacobs and Micki Dickoff. (light music) - I water it every day. Not too much. No matter where we are, we'll always remember that it's here, getting bigger and bigger. - [Both] Sticks and stones, nails and pins, Micki and Sunny will always be friends (giggling). - [Woman] Micki! Micki, it's time to go! - We're like sisters now, Sunny, for as long as we live. - But, I'll never see you again. I'm moving too far. - [Woman] Micki, hurry, we're leaving! - Yes, you will. (light music) (buzzer buzzing) - Okay, okay, I'm coming. (laughing) If I'd known it was you, Christie. (woman laughing) I don't suppose we could postpone this again? - Oh, no way. When we win that award, honey, we are gonna look good. - I wear more than this at the beach. - How 'bout this? Red. Lovely. - Got anything in leopard? - No, but I have this. - Mm-hm, this is it, yeah. This is the first step to selling out. Before you know it, I'll be wearing girdles and having my nails done. - It's the 90s, Micki. Even humanitarian, politically correct, freedom fighters can enjoy playing dress up once in a while. Besides, I get my nails done and I manage to hang on to my soul. - Lawyers don't have souls. (phone ringing) - I have elbow length gloves. - Ah, great, maybe you can wrestle me up a tiara. Hello? Mom. Yeah. It's okay. No, I'll give the tickets to my agent, he was dying to go anyway. and I think he's got a crush on Christie. I'll call you if I win. Sunny. No, what about her? Yeah, yeah, right. Okay. Bye. - They're not coming. - No. Some old friends are coming to visit from New York. - You upset? - Not about that. She told me that my best friend when I was a kid has been in prison for 15 years. What for? - Killing two cops. And the guy she was living with is being executed in May. - Nice friends, Mick. - I don't know him, but Sunny was the nicest kid in the world. Now she's a cop killer? - [Jeremy] This award is our calling card. - [Micki] Would you put that thing away? - Oh strut a little, darling, it's good for business. - Well, there's David Hayne. - Oh! - He wants to meet you. - Jeremy, I've gotten blisters from glad handing. - Micki, dear, the studios are crawling over him to finances his next movie. - He's not bad looking either. - Listen, he loved your AIDS documentary and if you plan right- - I don't want to play anyone, Jeremy. - Oh, he's not asking you to sell out, just be a bit more social. - Micki, people don't see documentaries, they see movies and David gets movies made. So, work with me. - Lead the way. (light music) (phone ringing) Hello? Sunny Jacobs? Yes, operator I'll accept. So, Sunny's parents thought it was my puppy. My folks thought it was hers. Anyway, we got away with it for a few weeks. - That was 30 years ago. If you're flying 3,000 miles to have a reunion with the same sweet little girl, you're gonna be disappointed. - I am also seeing my parents. - Oh yeah, right. What about our meeting with David Hayne? - Eh. - Hey, I've got my law practice to fall back on, but you, you've been waiting your whole life for this opportunity. - I'll reschedule. - Oh, she's been in prison for years. Why is this suddenly so important? - I don't know. We were like sisters growing up, like twins. We'd dress in the same outfits. We (laughing), we talked in secret codes. She was a good kid, Christie. How could she do something like this? It just doesn't make sense. - Murderers come from all kinds of neighborhoods, Micki, even yours. - I've gotta see her. (light music) - [Officer] Count, all inmates report to their cells. Recall. Recall. (light music) (door slamming) (light music) - Quick hug. It's all they allow. - This is weird, you're all grown up. You know, your face hasn't really changed. - Neither has yours, except for the wrinkles. - You certainly haven't lost any of your charm. You really look good. - Well, I exercise, I do yoga, get plenty of beauty rest. - Would you like a soda or something? - Yeah. - Okay. They feed you in here? - Yeah, prison food. Not a lot of choices if you're a vegetarian. - You are a vegetarian? - Yeah, I have been for years. - Hey, look what I found. - Oh, I kept mine too. All my stuff's been in storage though since my parents died. - I'm sorry, Sunny. Mom told me about the plane crash. - They let me go to the funeral. I only got to see the kids for about five minutes before they hauled me away. - That's awful. - Well, at least my parents got to see me get off death row before they died. Jury recommended life you know, but the judge overruled them. - Why? - I don't know. But, I think he used to be a state trooper. Anyway an appeals court finally commuted my sentence to life, but not Jesse's. - They allow you to see him? - Not since the trial, but we write to each other every day. - Tell me about your kids. - Eric is 25. - Oh, God. - He has a little girl. - Wait a minute. That makes you a grandmother. - Ha! - What about your daughter? - Tina. She was just a baby when I got here,. She's been with a foster family since my parents died. It's been hard. Can we talk about something else? - Sure. - [Man] Officer Houston, report to the attorney room. Officer Sandy Wall- - It was kind of strange, seeing her have to so long. It's funny, she hasn't changed that much. - Get used to hearing from folks you ain't seen. Jesse's execution will bring out all the ghouls and do-gooders. - Micki didn't come because of Jessie. She was my best friend. And you know when your kids, your best friend is like the most important thing in the whole world. - Hey as long as she keeps you in candy bars, she's got my vote. - I don't know how you packed everything in this one little bag. - Oh, nobody dresses up like they used to, Leon, people don't care. - People like to be comfortable. - Oh, you know, with a little more makeup and a new hairstyle, you could be so much prettier. I'm sure I could get you into my hairdresser tomorrow. - I'm visiting Sunny tomorrow, mom. - You're going back to that prison? - No, I'm going to meet it her for cocktails at the Fontainebleau. - There's no need to be sarcastic. - I'm sorry. I'm tired. - Well, if you wanna spend all your time here in a place like that, visiting with someone you haven't laid eyes on in 30 years. Fine. I just don't understand you. - You never did. - Welcome home, honey. - Thanks dad. - Do you remember that tree we planted? - Oh God. - I wonder if it's still there. - No, I went back to Elmont eight years ago and I tried to find it. All the trees looked alike. You know, I'm tired of talking about me. Tell me about you. - One day is pretty much like another, not a lot to tell. - How about what the hell happened? - Go ahead, say it, everybody else has. How could I have been stupid enough to get involved with an ex-convict? - Sunny, I'm just trying to understand. - Me two. Of the two of us I always figured you'd be the one to end up in trouble. - You're right. - I don't know if you can understand, you haven't changed that much from when we were kids. Me, I feel like I've already lived three or four lives and the person I was when I met Jesse, let's just say he was dangerous and exciting and I liked that. - Hm, paper's called you Bonnie and Clyde. - That crap sold a lot of papers, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the truth. We were just struggling to get by, trying to raise our kids. Mom asked me once why I didn't run when I found out Jesse had been in prison. Truth is he didn't tell me right away, by then I was hooked. - [Jesse] Come on baby girl. - [Sunny] By the time Tina was born, we were a real family. Jesse always treated Eric like his own son. We didn't have much money, but we had each other. And we were in love. (upbeat music) - I love you. - I love you. - Listen I gotta go out of town next week on business. - Thought you were gonna paint the mural for the daycare center. - Yeah, well, so did I till somebody told 'em I'd been in the joint. Anyway, I found this guy, he's got a couple nine millimeters for sale pretty cheap. No, listen. I can re-blue 'em and sell 'em. - I don't like this thing with the guns. - Oh Sunny, look, as long as your name's on that bill of sale, everything's legal. Sunny, it's something I can do and we need the money. - Jesse, I don't want you to go. - How 'bout you come with me? - Eric, will you please turn that thing down? (cartoons blaring) - I wanna go home. We've been here a week. When's the car gonna be fixed? - Honey, I don't know. Jesse said he would take care of it. - Can I at least go outside? - No. - I hate it here. - Pack up, we're living. - Now? - Yeah, this is Walter Rhodes, he's gonna give us a ride upstate. Hey man, why don't you grab a cup of coffee or something? - No problem. - Honey, can't we wait till morning? - No, he wants to go tonight. - He gives me the creeps. Who is he? - Just a guy I met up in prison. Look, it's just a ride. You wanna get outta here or not? - What's wrong, mommy. - Nothing, honey. Get up, we're gonna go home. Come on, sweetheart. - [Sunny] Why are we stopping now? - 'Cause your chauffeur needs some shuteye. You don't want me to fall asleep and kill us all do you? - It'll be daylight soon, I'm tired too. (light music) (dramatic music) - [Officer] This your gun? - What's the problem officer. - Is this yours? - [Rhodes] Yes, sir. - License and registration. - What are you hassling us for? We're not doing anything. - You just sit there and keep quiet. - [Eric] Mommy? - [Sunny] Lie there, it's okay. - We're parole violators, man, we're screwed. - Please be cool. - This is 1B12, I need a 10-29. - Is that gun one of ours? - Not anymore. (baby crying) Shut that kid up. - Would you relax? - [Sunny] I'm scared, Jesse. - Step out of the car. Keep your hands where I can see 'em. (dramatic music) You too. - What the hell'd I do? - Just step out of the car. - I can't, the door's broken. - You, step to the front of the car. Get out! (dramatic music) - Mommy. - It's okay, honey. Try to find Tina's bear. (Jesse yelling) (body slamming) - Found it, here. (gunshots firing) - [Man] Visiting hours are now over. - Who shot the cops? - I didn't see anything. All I know is I didn't do it and neither did Jesse. - If you didn't see, how do you know? - No physical contact. - I've gotta go. Thanks for coming. - Sunny. When can I come back? - Whenever. I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, I figured she was guilty too until I heard her side. - [Christie] So, you believe her? - In my heart I do. - And what does your head tell you? Come on, you run across an inmate who says he's guilty of anything, be sure and let me know. - Yeah, but what if she's telling the truth? What if she's innocent? - Well, in this country, you're innocent until proven guilty and she's been proven guilty. You're obsessing about this, you know? - No, I'm not. - [Christie] You have a real shot at getting the financing for your AIDS feature, Micki. The one thing you've talked about for the last five years and you're blowing it off. - I'm sorry, I know you don't understand, but I've got to do this. - Okay, it's your life. Take care of yourself. - Bye. - [Man] Attention on the compound, attention on the compound, medical will be open for five minutes. All inmates requiring medication, report to medical immediately. - Hi. - Hi. - Who was that? Kay Tafero, Jesse's mom. She wants me to confess to the shootings. Try and save Jesse. - I can't believe she'd asked you to do something like that. - I can. I'm a mother too. I said I'd talked to my lawyers about it, I'm in for life anyway. - Why should you? If it weren't for him- - Don't. I love him. - Sunny, I don't get it. Why aren't you angry with him for what happened? - Why should I be? So I'd have someone to blame? - Well, maybe I'm not that grown up. I think he ruined your life. - Micki. - You don't think he ruined your life? - I made my own choices. - Sunny, when I think about what you went through that day, how did you do it? - If I'd been alone, I really think I would have fallen apart, but I had those kids to think about. - [Rhodes] Come on dammit, come on! - Let's go, hurry. He's got the gun, Sunny. - Tell him to go without us. - Move it, now! - Come on baby girl. - Hurry! - Come on, Eric. - Let's go! - [Sunny] Oh my God, honey don't look. (radio chatter) - Come on! - Don't be scared, I've got you. - Here, take Tina. - Okay, it's okay. (baby crying) - [Dispatcher] Respond! (engine revving) (tires squealing) (dramatic music) - [Dispatcher] All units, we have shots fired. Officer down. (dramatic music) - We need another car. We're in this together. - [Sunny] Be careful, Jesse. - [Jesse] It'll be okay. I love you. - Let's go. - Need your car, mister. - Hey, what are you doing? (tires screeching) (dramatic music) (baby crying) - [Man] All vehicles pull to the right. All vehicles pull to the right. Have your driver's license and registration ready. Stay in the car. (helicopter thumping) - Good morning, can I see your driver's license and registration, please? - Damn! (dramatic music) (tires squealing) - [Jesse] What are you doing, man? Rhodes! - [Sunny] Jesse, the kids! - Rhodes! - Stop that car! Stop or we'll shoot! Stop! (gun firing) - Oh no! - Get down! (guns firing) (Rhodes screaming) (tires squealing) (dramatic music) - [Rhodes] Oh, my leg. - [Cop] Everyone out! Let's go, let's go. - Come on, Eric. - [Cop] Let's see those hands. Back outta there. Slow, guy, nice and slow. - [Cop] Everybody outta the car with your hands up where I can see 'em! - Get outta there, come on! Hands up, let's see your hands. - Move it slow. - [Cop] Get your hands on the hood. Put your hands behind you. - [Cop] Fall back will you please. (rifle smacking) - Stay back, stay back. Stay back. Let's go! - Stop it! Stop it, you're gonna kill him! Jesse? Jesse? - Mommy! Mommy! - Wait, wait, those are my children. - Mommy! - Don't take my children! Why? Please, we didn't do anything! I want my children! - Two good me are dead because of you, now shut up! - I want my children. (hand pounding) Beauty rest later, sit up! - I told you over and over. - Tell it again. I never get tired of hearing a good story. Huh? (man whispering) - All right. Ballistics match those slugs we dug outta those two troopers to the nine millimeter we found on your boyfriend. - I told you, I didn't see what happened. Don't give me this see no evil, hear no evil crap! - I just wanna know what happened to my kids. - If I don't start hearing the truth, you may never see those kids again. - [Eric] Mommy! Mommy! - What are you doing, hey! Hey! - Eric? - [Eric] I want my mommy. - Hey! - Baby, are you okay? - Mommy I'm scared, they keep asking me stuff. - Let's go. - Tell them you want grandma. Tell them to call grandma. Eric, I love you. I love you. Tell Tina mommy loves her. - Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - They kept him in a detention center for weeks. Can you imagine that? A little boy all alone and scared. My parents finally got him out. It's amazing he never lost faith in me. - What about Tina? - Tina gave up on me a long time ago. - Sunny it's okay, let it go. You don't show emotion in here, Micki. If they see me crying I'll go to lock up. - They do that? - I brought some pictures. Mom and dad brought them to see me every chance they could. Tina was only seven when they died. - Sunny, you lost your whole life. - Micki. Micki, I have a life. Maybe not the one I would have preferred, but I make the best of it. - You're something. You spend 15 years in prison for something you didn't do. - But I was there and those men died and there isn't a day goes by that I don't think about their children. - You didn't kill those two men, Sunny. You weren't committing a crime when it happened, so how could they convict you? - Well, it wasn't exactly a fair fight. - Hi Sonia, Andy Bent. Sorry I'm late. This is just a formality. They'll read the charges against you, you'll make your plea and be outta here. I'm your lawyer. Judge Zackler appointed me. Good morning Mr. Satz. - Andy. (dramatic music) - Jesse. Where's Rhodes? - They're arraigning him separately. Part of his deal. - What deal? - I thought you knew. He's going to testify that you and Tafero killed those cops. (dramatic music) - The press was playing up the Bonnie and Clyde thing, cop killers. And the DA was relying heavily on Rhode's testimony. I kept thinking nobody in their right mind would believe him. - [Satz] And after Sonia fired the gun? - Jesse got away from the other cop, grabbed the gun from Sonia, and opened fire. - I have no further questions. - You may step down. - Rhodes played right to the jury. I couldn't believe what was happening, but no matter how much I complained, Andy kept saying Satz had no case. And then the nightmare got worse. Lucky for Satz, along came Brenda Isham. - [Satz] Where did you meet Sonia Jacobs? - We were in the same cell. - Did you ever discuss her case? - She said she was glad she killed him. She'd do it again. (hand smacking) - [Judge] Court is adjourned till 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. (gavel rapping) - I never exchanged one word with that girl, I swear. I want you to put me on the stand. - Satz would tear you apart. Don't worry, I'm preserving everything for the appeal. - You keep talking about an appeal, if there's no evidence, how can they find me guilty? - Sonia, I'm an experienced lawyer, I know what I'm doing. They have no case. - [Sunny] I read somewhere that if a jury has voted to acquit, they'll usually make eye contact with the defendant when they return. None of them looked at me that day. - Jury has reached a verdict in this case. In the charge of first degree murder, we find the defendant, Sonia Jacobs, guilty. (people mumbling) (gavel rapping) - Jesse! - I'll write you every day. I love you, Sonia. - Sonia, will you beg for mercy? - I don't want mercy, I wanted justice. That's all. (dramatic music) - How have you survived in here? - Well death row will prepare you for just about anything. - What do you mean? - Four years, seven months, 19 days in a little box, all alone, and room for six paces. And that's what I did all day, I'd pace back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth. You know what they call you on the row? - No. - Dead man. 'Cause that's what you are. The walking dead. And I was only allowed to read two books. The Bible and a law book. I guess they figured either way, live or die, I'd be prepared. - Can you talk to me, please? Please, please, will somebody talk to me! (tray crashing) (hands pounding) Please, somebody talk to me! I knew I was losing my mind and that pretty soon there would be nothing left inside. So, I learned to meditate, to examine my life and my situation. And I realized there were two ways of looking at it. I could be in a cell or a sanctuary. I couldn't change where I was, so I changed my perception. - I wanna help. - Got a hacksaw on ya? - I'm serious. - Why? - You don't belong here. Sunny, what they've done to you makes me sick. I'll do everything I can to help you, but there's one condition. You tell me the truth, always. I wanna talk to your lawyers. - You'll like them. They've worked for free ever since the money ran out. - I wanna meet Eric and Tina. - [Tina] Why are you doing this? - Because I think she's innocent. I thought you'd be happy, Tina. - Happy? What difference does it make if I'm happy? I mean, you think anybody gives a damn? - [Eric] Hey Tina, knock it off. - Do whatever you want. I don't even know why I came. - I'm sorry. She needs to blame someone and mom's it. - Yeah, but you don't blame her. - I remember. It happened just the way she told you. Just the way she told everybody. Nobody was interested in the truth. And the hardest part is knowing that I might've been able to help her. She should've let me testify. - Why didn't she? - She said I'd I'd been through enough and she said she would go to the electric chair before she'd let them rip me apart on the witness stand. - Eric, you were a little kid. Even if the prosecutor didn't manage to trip you up on some detail, sweetie, they would've figured you were lying just to protect your mom. Anyway, I don't mean to intrude, but I wanna help. - Quite the contrary. We're grateful for any help that you can give us. A fresh perspective would be nice. - Sunny's final appeal has to be submitted within six months. - This is Holly Strafer, Sunny's co-counsel, Micki Dickoff. - Nice to meet you. Six months? - It really isn't that long. If the appeal fails, and the odds are 10,000 to one it will, Sunny will be in prison for the rest of her life. So, where would you like to begin? - What have you got for me to read? Christie? It's me. Listen, can you come out here for a few days? Hmm. - I guess she could take the sofa. - Mom, I wouldn't ask Christie to stay here without asking. I rented an apartment today. - Well, it just defies reason. First, you give up a perfectly good teaching job to pursue a film career. And now that something's finally come of that, you throw it all away for this. - What would you like me to do? Just forget about it? Go back to LA? She was my best friend. - And what if you're wrong? I mean, have you even considered that? What if she is a murderer? - Well, you'll get to repeat your favorite expression. You were right and I was wrong. Her lawyer should have let her testify. If the jury had heard her, they never would have convicted her. - Read this. They found six guns in the car, all registered to Sunny. It says she confessed to two cops and she lied, Micki. - You told the cop, you were only a hitchhiker? That you didn't even know Rhodes. Or Jesse? - I was terrified. I'd been through hell that night. I would have said anything, anything to get out of there and get back to my kids. - What about those confessions? Micki, I never confessed to anyone. - But all those guns, they were all registered in your name. - That's right they were registered, meaning I didn't break any laws. - Don't play games with me, Sunny. - Look, I made a lot of stupid mistakes and believe me, I've had plenty of time to think about it, but I've also had enough judgment to last three lifetimes and I sure as hell don't need it from you. - Now you listen to me, I've learned a few things in the last 15 years myself and one of them is only a fool accepts everything on blind faith. I have put my life on hold for you. - Hey, you contacted me, remember. If you've changed your mind, go on, get outta here. Find somebody else's flag to wave. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Oh, come on, that's what you do isn't it? Just go from one lost cause to another, Saint Micki. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that. Forgive me? - Sunny? Okay, but if you lie to me, I'm gone. - Okay, I've written down everything I can think of, questions to ask, documents to request. - I don't know how to thank you. - Oh, this is such a long shot, Micki. - Yeah. I am scared to death how I could screw things up for her? Oh, I'm way over my head. But, I couldn't quit now even if I wanted to. - You take care. - Bye. Bye! - Sunny, is there any way I can get ahold of Jesse's records? - Kay has them, but I doubt if she'll be very helpful. Jose said it would be pointless for me to say I did it. She's pretty upset. - How can she hold that against you? It's crazy. - They're about to execute her only child. You'd be crazy too. - [Man] Visiting hours are now over. - He's got a stay. There's a chance for clemency, don't give up hope. - There is no hope. The media, the lawyers, the politicians, have already decided. Bye. - Any word about Jesse? - No. - If Brenda Isham recanted her testimony, would it help? - If we could prove she was coached or coerced, but first you have to find her. Then get her to admit she's a liar. Not likely. - She lied, plain and simple, we gotta find her. We've had a private detective looking for her for months. - Jesse's stay has been lifted. The execution is tonight. (dramatic music) - Sunny? - Jesse? - 1977. That's the last time I heard your voice. - Sometimes I thought about you so hard, I'm sure you could hear me, hear my thoughts. - Oh, I wish I could see you. - Me too. - Mom came by. Tina too. - Tina? - They strip searched her. 15-years-old and they strip searched her. - Is she okay? - Oh yeah, she was so grown up. I told her I almost didn't recognize her 'cause she was wearing makeup. She did the damnedest thing. She took out a tissue and wiped the makeup off, right there at the table. Listen, I know this is hard for you. - It's okay, baby, I love you. - I'm gonna make this easier, I'm gonna hang up first, okay? - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. (crowd yelling) - Hey Micki, real zoo, huh? Must be 10 times worse at Jesse's prison. - I need to see her, Bob. - Wish there was something I could do, but I can't. (crowd yelling) - I know about the rules, just give me a break. Five minutes, just five minutes. Please! - [Man] He's dead! You won't believe it, they pulled the switch three times and his head caught on fire. (crowd cheering) - [Reporter] Tina, Tina! (phone ringing) - Should I get that? (phone ringing) - [Sunny] Kay? - I'm sorry, my grandmother can't talk right now. - Tina? Tina, it's me, mom. Honey talk to me. Tina, please. (knuckles knocking`) - Don't you vultures ever give up? It's been three months. Find another story and leave me alone. - I'm a friend of Sunny Jacobs, Mrs. Tafero, I'm not a reporter. Please, I'm just trying to save my friend, the way you were trying to save Jesse. - He was an artist. He studied Japanese brush painting in prison, loved to read. He was a writer, you know? They burned him at the stake and your friend could have saved him. - You're wrong. Sunny's the only person in the whole world who loved him as much as you do. - She could have lied for him. - Mrs. Tafero, Sunny is not responsible for Jesse's death. If you need to blame someone, blame Walter Rhodes, blame Michael Satz, blame the public's need for revenge, but not Sunny. She loved your son. - Do you think he was innocent? Transcripts are in those boxes. - Thank you. - I want them back. - Yeah, but I was only three weeks late with my payment. Can't you raise my credit limit? I've been a good customer for 20 years. Yeah, well, I'm expecting a residual checks soon and I'll send it in then. Hm, thanks. So, I lied. - This must be tough. - Yeah, well they always wanna give you credit until you need it. - Huh. - Okay, where were we? - Rhodes recanted his testimony three times. He said he did it all, but it didn't make any difference. Didn't jive with ballistics or the witness accounts. See, the bullet that hit the police car definitely came from the back of the Camaro and the truck driver, Hyman, remembers Rhodes in front. - Yeah, but both truck drivers clearly remember seeing Jesse pinned on the hood of the police car when the first shots were fired. - Yeah, so if Rhodes and Jesse are both in front, who fired from the back? - It wasn't Sunny. - I know, I know, I know, but who? - I don't know. - I'm beat. I'm gonna hit the road. - Okay. - You know, you oughta get some sleep too. - Yeah. Holly, what about Brenda Isham? - Nothing yet, Mick. I'll check with our detective again tomorrow, okay? Night. - Night, Holly. That's it. - Micki, what's wrong? - Jose, you're not gonna believe this. I figured out what happened. So, this is Hyman's truck parked here. Rhodes is standing at the front of the Camaro before the shooting starts. Both the truck drivers see this and see the cops subdue Jesse and slam him on the hood of the police car. And then their testimony differs. McKenzie sees Trooper Black make a radio call and sees Rhodes moved to the back of the Camaro. But Hyman never sees any of this because McKenzie's truck blocks Hyman's view. By the time McKenzie's truck clears Hyman, the shooting starts and Hyman is watching the action. The cops falling. Now, it never registered in Hyman's mind Rhode's moved because he never saw it. - But there's still one problem. Ballistics show the shots came from the back seat. They inserted a pole into the bullet hole that they found in the police car. The trajectory pointed directly to where Sunny was seated. - But Rhodes was the one who drove the police car away from the scene, so they don't know exactly where it was parked. Now look, if you shift it, even a foot, now the trajectory points behind the Camaro where Rhodes moved. At the trial, he swore Sunny fired the gun, then handed it to Jesse. But Rhodes was the only one who conclusively tested positive for firing a gun that day. - If you're right, it proves that Sunny was innocent. - It proves Jesse was too. - How did you arrange this? - Jose did it. I am part of your defense team now. - Wow. - That is not the best part. I figured out what happened that day. But Sunny, my theory proves both of you were innocent. - No, you don't understand. Jesse always said that he didn't do it, but I never really knew. And I guess in the back of my mind, I figured if he did do it that somehow it justified me being here all these years. - Sunny, I'm sorry, I thought in some way this would make you happy. - Oh, it does. His mom will know and Eric and Tina will know. I just wish I could tell him I'm sorry. - Jose says it'll be hard to get the graphics in the appeal. - Either way I win. - How's that? - You've shown me what it's like to trust somebody again. Have somebody trust me. - Great, we can exchange phone calls and letters and I can tell you what a great life you're missing. - Oh, Micki. I'll be fine. I'm more worried about you. I'm flying to Wyoming tomorrow. I've got a lead on Brenda Isham and then I'm going back to LA, take care of some business. What? - I was just remembering that day when you moved away with your parents. - Well, this time I'm coming back. (knuckles rapping) Are you Brenda Isham? - Yeah. - I'd like to talk to you about Sonia Jacobs. - I heard she was a cop killer. That she had gunned down those two men with her kids watching. - So, you lied. - It's not that simple. I was only a kid. They had an airtight case against me. - Did they propose a deal? - I was afraid that I would rot in jail for the next 10 years if I didn't help them out I'm sorry. I didn't know what had happened to her or to him. - If you're really sorry, you'll come back and testify. - No, I can't go back there. - Listen to me. Two policemen are dead. A man has been executed and two children grew up without a mother or a father. No one can change that, Brenda. But, Sunny has been rotting in a prison for 15 years for something she didn't do. You can change that. - I'll swear out a statement. I'll let you video tape me, whatever you want. But, I can't go back there. - She felt threatened so she lied to convict Sunny. - Granted, but unless she swears to it in court, it does us no good. - What about Rhodes? He recanted on three separate occasions for God sakes. One of them was under oath. He even admitted he lied to the other prisoner. - Grow up, Micki. Convicts change their testimony with the weather. - So, he lies when he takes it back, but not when he points his finger to save his own neck? - Unfortunately, yes. - Well, that should have at least gotten them a new trial. The only weapon Satz had was Rhodes. - Okay, here it is. Complete with graphics. We're messengering it over to the appellate court tomorrow. This is our last chance for revisions. - It'll be the last chance, period. These are the graphics I used. - It'd make a great segment, especially if you can get Brenda Isham. - I talked to her last night. She said she'd do it. - She'll face 20 million people on TV, but she won't face Michael Satz? - I know. - Yeah. Thanks. Turn the TV on, channel seven. - They've overturned her conviction, - [Reporter] Can you retry Sonia? - [Reporter] What about Jesse Tafero? - [Reporter] Did Walter Rhodes lie? - Walter Rhodes passed the polygraph test. I wouldn't have made the deal if he hadn't. Jesse Tafero was guilty, just like Sonia Jacobs is guilty and yes, we will retry her. - [Reporter] Will you cut a deal with Sonia? - No deals. Thank you, that's all. - Jose, it's me. - Micki, we've been trying to reach you for hours. The appellate court overturned- - It's on the news. Does she know? - [Jose] No, she's- - Let me tell her. I can make it to Broward in half an hour. She's not at Broward, Sunny's missing. (dramatic music) - Where are you taking me? This isn't legal, I'm not supposed to leave the prison. (dramatic music) - Let's go, come on. Move it. - Where are you taking me? (dramatic music) - This is unbelievable. I want her located and returned tonight. - Look, we had the court order to release her. When her verdict was overturned, she was given over to local authorities to await retrial. She's no longer the state's responsibility. There was nothing I could do. - Sunny was afraid of this. That's why we filed the motion. - What motion? - We have a court order preventing her removal or transfer. - I'm sorry, but we never got it. - We're gonna get her back and if one hair on her head is harmed, we're gonna file a lawsuit so big that it's gonna sink the state. - I know it's late, but it's an emergency. Could you have judge Enriquez call Jose Quinones' office, please. Thank you. - What's the point of getting a court order if it's never delivered to the warden? Yeah, well talk is cheap. No, no, no, no, first thing in the morning. Okay. - Mm, talk is cheap, coming from a lawyer. - You a smart aleck. You're smiling. - I've even been known to laugh on occasion. - Hell, well that I would have to see. Why don't you go on. I'll wait for the judge to call. - I sent Christie a copy of the deposition and she faxed me back some notes so I'd like to go through them. - You know, Sunny is a very lucky lady. - Yeah. She's led a charmed life. (phone ringing) - Hello? Judge. (speaking foreign language) Perfecto. Uh-huh. (intense music) - Home sweet home. - Is that her? - I don't know. What do you think? Do you see her? - It's her. - Sunny, Sunny! - Hey! (horn honking) Hey! Your honor, Sonia Jacobs has already spent 16 years behind bars for a conviction which was overturned. It would be an outrage to deny her a reasonable bail pending a new trial. - Mr. Satz? - Your honor, the defendant is still charged with the brutal murder of two police officers. The people vehemently oppose any bond request. - Mr. Quinone, how's your client gonna make bond? - Your honor, I have a house in Boston I'd be willing to put up as collateral and I'd gladly take full responsibility for Sunny, I mean, Sonia. - Your honor, since Mr. Satz tried the original case and we filed a motion to disqualify him, we feel he is unduly prejudiced against our client. - She is charged with murder, Your Honor, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't seek to keep her in custody and I resent any other implication. - Well, the nature of the charges against the defendant are such that I'm going to deny the bond motion. For the record, Mr. Quinone, I've known Mr. Satz for 20 years. I've always found his professional ethics to be of the highest standards. Next case. (gavel rapping) - What rock did Satz crawl out from under? - He's feeling the heat and it could bite us in the ass. He's got a re-convict her, his career to be on the line. - Holly's right. We're cornering him. - If we win, you'll have to explain why his star witness lied to get two convictions and why an innocent man was executed. - They could file a motion to recuse the judge. He and Satz are awful chummy. - Keep the judge. It won't matter anyway. At least he's honest enough to admit it. - But it could help them, Sunny. It could be to their advantage. - They already have the advantage. Why do you think I've spent the last 16 years in prison? They can do whatever they want. - Coming back to the office? - I've got something to do, I'll see you later. (knuckles rapping) - Okay. Let me help. Put it in there. - Yeah. I've brought the last of your files back. Hi Tina. - Oh, Tina's just going to take out the wash for me. - Oh, well listen, can I give you any help here? Let me get that. All right. - Thank you. - They called us the Siamese twins in camp. Then I moved away and we lost touch. - Yeah, I know the feeling. - I know you've had it tough, Tina. Must've been terrible not having your parents, but when she gets out- - Cut the crap, okay? I've heard it all my life. I'll be home by your birthday, by Christmas, by graduation. It's all just a bunch of lies. - She didn't lie, Tina. She believed in the system. - Yeah, right? The truth will set me free, honey. That was another one of her favorite expressions. So, I waited and waited and waited. Well, I'm not waiting anymore. - Look, she made some mistakes, some big ones, but it's not her fault it's taken so long. - People like you make me sick, you know? With your perfect houses, and perfect families, and perfect mothers. Well, my fairytale is a little different, okay? - Look, maybe you've had more than your share of grief, Tina, but look around, there aren't any perfect families in this world. It takes lots of love and forgiveness for any family to stay together. - Well, I'm fresh out. (light music) - Tina. She's got enough for both of you. - Hi, mom? I was just thinking about you. No, no, nothing's wrong. - Maybe it's time to consider an alternative theory. Jesse's gone. We can't help him, but it might help Sunny if we give him up as a shooter. - If we do that, then what's the difference between them and us? Besides, she'd never go for it. - Okay, it was a bad idea. - I don't think Satz is as confident as he'd like us to believe. He's gotta try to convict Sunny again on a case that's 16 years old. It's tough to do when your star witnesses is Walter Rhodes. How many times can he lie without tripping himself up? - Satz cut a deal because Rhodes passed the polygraph. Has anyone actually seen that test? I mean, we all know he lied, so how did he pass it? - The test wasn't used as evidence. - Then why don't we get our own expert to look at and if we prove that he didn't pass it- - Micki, I don't wanna do it now, I wanna use it as ammo for the trial. - I think you should do it now. - Well thank you very much for your opinion, but Sunny's my client. - Then why don't you represent her? - You know what? I think I've heard enough from you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well this is about Sunny's life and it's not just about Sunny. It's the whole system is shot to hell when it allows somebody like Walter Rhodes to barter his life for hers with the same people who are supposedly dispensing justice. - Are you through? - Not until you agree to get the polygraph guy. - All right. - Good. - That woman is gonna give me a heart attack. (phone ringing) - Hello? - You want some good news? - You heard from the polygraph guy? - No, actually I was gonna give you a tip on a horse race. - Come on. - The most bungled test he has ever seen. We're going to depose the same guy who gave Rhodes the original test. - Oh, I wanna be there. - All right. But, you have to promise me that you will keep your mouth shut. - Oh, you know me? (laughing) Yeah, bye. Yes! - Let's go. - During the polygraph you asked Rhodes, "Did you see Jesse shoot both police officers?" And in your report to Mr. Satz you wrote that Rhodes responded, "Yes." Correct? - That's right. - But if you look at the actual polygraph chart, you wrote that he responded, "No." - Not exactly. - This is your handwriting, isn't it? - Yes, but- - Are saying that when you wrote no, you really meant yes? - No, that's not what I'm saying. I must have changed the wording on the questions or something. Okay, it was a long time ago. I really don't remember. - On page two of your reports, you wrote, "Rhodes says he could not be sure whether Sonia fired at all." Yet he swore at the trial Sonia fired the first shot. - Let's go somewhere. - Satz is running scared. - Do you know when the lion is most dangerous? When he's injured or his back is to the wall. Don't underestimate Satz and don't fill Sunny's head with promises you can't keep. In the meantime, I filed a discovery motion for everything in Satz' files with Rhodes' name on it and I'm counting on you to help me find something we can use. Let's not keep his honor waiting. (reporters yelling) - I don't believe it, they finally came to see you. - [Sunny] I think they came for you. - Mr. Quinone. - Your honor, we call Walter Rhodes to the stand and I'd like your permission to treat him as a hostile witness. - Objection. - Gentlemen, this is not a trial. It's merely a hearing to determine whether or not Mr. Satz should be disqualified as the prosecutor for this case. So, I'm going to allow some latitude in questioning the witnesses. - Thank you, Your Honor. In 1977, and 1979, and again in 1982, you recanted your original testimony that Sonia and Jesse Tafero had shot the two officers. Is that correct? - I only recanted in 1982. - Didn't you say under oath, "I put two people on death row for something that they didn't do, that I did." - That's right. - But today you're saying that those recantations were all lies, that you stand by your original testimony. - Yeah. - What was the reason for recanting your testimony? - I wanted to get back at them. Give 'em a hard time. - And who is them? - The DA's office, that bunch. - And you wanted to give them a hard time because they weren't helping you get your parole so you can get better work assignments, privileges, that sort of thing. - That's right. - And did you get what you wanted? - Usually. - So, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want. Including lying to help Mr. Satz get death penalty convictions on Sonia and Jesse. - Is that a question? - Not in my mind. - [Man] Attention on the compound, there will be no mail or canteen this evening. - So, you never told me how it went. - It went okay, I guess. - Then how come you look like the kid who didn't get nothing for Christmas? - I don't know. I guess the closer I get to the front door, the more I'm afraid something's gonna screw up. - Hey, you gotta keep your head up. Think positive. Let your light shine, girl. In other words, you gotta do all this stuff you keep telling me to do. You're gonna be fine. (speaking foreign language) - Hey, we went ahead and ordered. - Remember the 1977 confession that Rhodes made to another inmate that he was the shooter? - Convict testimony, it's worthless. - Yeah, but there was a guard who may have overheard the conversation. It was buried in that last batch of files. - This is suppressed evidence. If Jesse's attorneys had seen this, they could have saved his life. I'm gonna rub this in Satz' face. - Good. I want everyone to know those bastards didn't just cross the line, they tried to erase it. - If Walter Rhodes had failed his polygraph test, would you have made a plea bargain with him? - Of course not. - And yet to report of this test, which you deemed so important, was never provided to Sonia Jacob's attorney. - It wasn't a verbatim statement, so I didn't feel it was necessary to hand it over. The state Supreme Court agreed with me. - But, the 11th circuit overturned the conviction, based on that, didn't they? - If I had thought it was going to be an appellate point, I would have handed it over. - Well, that's certainly a new legal standard. Weren't you fearful that even the most incompetent lawyer would have used Rhodes' statement, "I don't know if Sonia fired at all," to prove that he'd lied on the polygraph? - Polygraph results or subjective counselor. That's why they're in admissible. You should know that. - But, you put a lot of stock in them. You made a deal that resulted in the execution of Jesse Tafero and life in prison for Sonia Jacobs, based on Walter Rhodes' polygraph. - I relied on the analysis given to me and that indicated that Mr. Rhodes was telling the truth. - Apparently the truth can be a subjective thing in the hands of your polygraph expert. Tell me one more thing, Mr. Satz. Didn't you think it was unethical to hire Rhodes' public defender, the same man that you made a deal with, to be your chief assistant shortly after the trial? - No, I had known the man for years and thought he was a terrific lawyer. - Did the paraffin test indicating that Rhodes was the only one who had definitely fired a gun concern you? - Those tests were inconclusive. - What about the fact that Rhodes drove the getaway car, initiated the kidnapping of Mr. Levington? - Which question would you like me to answer? - Answer me this. Do you recall seeing this document? It's a deposition from Henry Claycomb, a prison guard who overheard Rhodes tell another inmate that he was the shooter. - I don't recall. - This document was in your files, Mr. Satz. I'll tell you for sure who didn't see this, Jesse Tefaro's lawyers. Now, if you were representing him, wouldn't you have wanted this information? - Yes, I suppose I would. (people mumbling) - Did the fact that you were running for state attorney's office at the time, have any bearing on your actions on this high profile case? - I ran on my record, not this trial. - No further questions, Your Honor. - I've waited years to see that man break a sweat. - Yes! - Satz has offered a deal. - I knew it. - What's The deal? - He'll promise not to retry you, but you have to take the stand and swear that Rhodes didn't pull the trigger. Satz says if you agree to the deal, you could be eating a steak dinner tonight. - That's the same as saying Jesse and I killed those men. - I pushed him hard today. He'll look like a fool if he let's you walk. - You didn't do anything but expose what really happened. We can't let Satz do this. - This is Sunny's decision. It's a one-time offer. I want you to think about this very carefully. - Sunny, Jose's right. Another trial could drag on forever and you could still lose. (dramatic music) - Tell Mr. Satz I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat steak. I will not confess to something I didn't do and I will never betray Jesse. - Maybe you should reconsider Satz deal. - Did Jose put you up to this? - He's worried, he thinks it may be your only chance. - What kind of a chance is that, Micki? A chance to say that we were murderers and that Jesse deserved to die? I'd rather face a new jury. Do you think I should take the deal? - I can't tell you what to do. Nobody can. - Micki, would you take the deal? - Don't ask me that, Sunny. - There was a time when I would've taken this deal, any deal? But, not anymore. They may have my body, but not my soul. I'll be fine. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Satz wants to meet at the courthouse first thing in the morning. - Is he gonna offer a new deal? - That'd be my guess. You're the only one I've called. So, please keep this to yourself. - Yeah, sure. - [Jose] See you in court. - I just get so nervous at those parole hearings. - I'm gonna coach you this time. Remember how I got Nelly out two years early? All right, come Mother's Day you're gonna be home with your kids where you belong. - We got a transfer order on you. - Where? - Courthouse. - Come on. They don't drag it down to the courthouse this late on Friday for nothing. Get going! - [Woman] You go girl, you go. - [Woman] Go Sunny, we're praying for you. - [Woman] Good luck, honey. - [Woman] Good luck, Sunny. - [Woman] Go to it, Sunny. - Hi. - I can't believe you made it. - Oh, me neither. They were closing the doors of the plane when I got on. - Hey, did you reach Tina. - Nah, I left a message. - Hi, thanks for coming down. - Well, I hope they let her go. - Me too. - You should've heard your father last night, bragging about you to anybody who would listen. - You were? - To tell the truth, I was bragging a little too. - Thanks, mom. Jose, where's Sunny? - I'm going up now. - Not without me. - You say nothing that will influence her, you understand me? You sure know how to keep a secret. It's called the Alfred Plea. It's not used much, but basically what it means is that you maintain your innocence, charges against you will be read in court, and you agree not to contest them. - And that's it? I go free? - This way Satz is protected. You can't sue him or the state. - Money and liability, that's all it's about. - It's the best he'll ever offer. - [Micki] It's up to you. (dramatic music) - I've been here a long time. I wanna see my kids. I wanna watch my granddaughter grow up. I don't have to say anything? No lies? - No. - Then tell Satz I'll take the deal. - Listen to me Sunny, this whole deal hangs on your silence. If you say anything, anything that refutes Satz, the whole deal could blow? (triumphant music) - All right, shall we proceed? Sonia Jacobs, you're charged with two counts of murder. - Your honor, may I have a glass of water? I have a very bad taste in my mouth. Thank you. - All right. Sonia Jacobs, our records show that you have served 16 years, 233 days of your original sentence. - Sounds right. - Well, then I order you freed for time served. (people celebrating) - [Officer] No physical contact till she's processed. (upbeat music) (reporters yelling) - [Reporter] What made you change your mind? - Was Sonia Jacobs innocent, Mr. Satz? - Listen everybody, it'll be awhile before she's processed out. There's a pub down the street, we can all- - My treat. Let's make it champagne. - You guys go on ahead, I'll see you later. - Almost half my life and this is all there is. You keep it. - Hi, I was told Sonia Jacobs would be released here. - [Man] Beautiful day isn't it, Chris? - I got a thing at my kids' school tomorrow. Cover my shift for me? - No problem. - Thank you. - I picked this for you. - Well, someone must know where she is. (knuckles rapping) Micki! (light music) I'm not coming back in there. (upbeat music)
