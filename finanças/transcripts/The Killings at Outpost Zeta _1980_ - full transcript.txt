(ominous music) - Outpost Zeta, come in. A 3W4. Outpost Zeta, do you read me? Outpost Zeta, do you read? Answer. Reply. Outpost Zeta, reply. (machinery beeping) - When? - At 08:33, commander. We're coming up on it now. (machinery beeping) (ominous music) (crunching) - Run a line and see what kind of luck are you having with the contact. No luck so far. We've been trying to reach Zeta for a while. - Commander Craig, we have a single lock on Zeta, sir, we're initiating communication. - Outpost Zeta, this is Commander Craig, respond. Respond. Answer me, damn you, answer me! - Sir, shall I maintain a signal watch? Sir? - Yes. Set a monitor on the Zeta frequency, and all emergency frequencies as well. Automatic record mode, from now until I tell you to stop. Anything that even remotely sounds like it comes from Zeta, call me, 24 hours, understand? - Yes sir. - Keep on it for 24 hours, and get back to me if you have any response from Zeta. Keep up the good work. - Arnie? Keep trying set an active comm link. Four more. - The line's open. - 10, 9, 45. - Yes sir. - Zeta. (ominous music) (knocking) - Come in. - Commander, I thought you might be able to use this. - Mary, what are you still doing here? You should have gone home hours ago, but I'm glad you didn't, thank you. - You're welcome, sir. - I made an idiot of myself this morning, Mary. - No one faults you for it, sir. - I do. - We all know the situation at outpost Zeta. We all understand. - What is the situation in outpost Zeta, Mary? Do you know? Does anyone? We're the pathfinders. We go in first. We make it safe. We clear the way for the rest of the Star Fleet to follow. And sometimes we die. 12, this time, Mary, 12 in three months. The first team functioned for two years, without any sign of trouble, and then that six. The rescue team went out, three more, the second rescue team, three more, and now they're gone. What's going on out there, Mary? What's on that God forsaken piece of rock? - We don't know that they did. There could be any number of reasons why they can't communicate. - No. After a while, you get a feeling for a situation like this one. I feel that Zeta's a graveyard. But feelings don't count, we've got to know. Pull the signal red volunteer files, Mary, have them on my desk first thing in the morning. I'm gonna have to pick out some other people who don't mind getting themselves killed in that God forsaken planet. (ominous music) Good morning, gentlemen. As you know, we have a problem with base Zeta. A pathfinder team was deployed on June 14th, 2100. The team functioned without mishap for roughly two years, and then on May 10th of this year, for no apparent reason, we lost contact with them. - The establishment of a secure base there will be critical to our explorations in sector seven. There is no other Earth type planet within light years of Zeta. Based on your reports, and observations, submitted by your pathfinders, we had anticipated beginning to deploy men and material within two months. Colony ships were to follow within six. Are you saying that won't be possible? - It may not. Without knowledge of what has happened to those men and women that we've already sent in, I cannot recommend proceeding with base Zeta. We need to find the answer. - Exactly how do you intend to do this, commander? And how quickly? We need that planet. - Yes sir. I've assembled a signal red assignment team. As captain and commanding officer, Clark Young. - 38 years old, veteran of the Sirius and Pleiades campaigns. Battle citations include three star clusters, medal of honor. - Biologist Carol Sisco. - 40 years old. Intellectual rating genius level. Responsible for stopping the epidemic on Aldebaran 6. - The virus thing that wiped out the entire star base? - Yes sir. Engineer Paul Carey. - 35 years old, joined Star Fleet 2087. - Medical doctor, Linda Saunders. - She's 32. This will be her first signal red assignment. Especially recommended for her abilities as a diagnostician. - There will be two security officers aboard, chief officer Sigmund Stewart. - 40 years old. Commander of the ground campaign against the Veygans. Numerous citations for valor. Also medal of honor winner. - Our second security officer is Gore Statt. - A 10 year veteran. Presently holds rank of Star Sergeant Major. Ranked first in his division in both armed and unarmed combat. A record of... - Thank you Mary. Gore's reputation also proceeds him. Well you've chosen well, commander. - Thank you sir. - When will this suicide mission of yours be ready for lift off? - My special assignment team will be ready to lift off within 72 hours, with your approval, gentlemen. - Of course. Approved. - Approved. - Approved. Now listen, don't fail us. (drum rolling music) - Yo. - Hello, Carol. - Clarke. Where is that 50 you owe me from that last mess I got you out of? - I'll tell you what, double or nothing. - All right. - This is very interesting. - Thank you. - Really appreciate it. - Carey. - Hello. - Good to see you. - Miss Saunders. - At ease. Clarke, good to see you. - Good to see you, commander. - Sigmund. - Commander. - Gore, how's the family? - Doing fine, sir. - Carey, how are ya? - Fine sir, good to see you. - Carol. I'm glad you're shipping with us again. - Commander, I hope this is not a long voyage. I was at a crucial stage with some microbe experiments that promise to revolutionize my whole... - I hope it won't be either, Carol. - Well I hope so too. - And Dr. Sanders, welcome to the pathfinder group. - Thank you, sir. - For a first mission, you drew a tough one. - I'll manage, sir. - I trust you. Please, sit down. You have all received a preliminary briefing on the situation at Zeta, so I won't go in anymore detail now. All available information has been programmed into your ship's data bank. You will have an opportunity to study the data on the way out. I want to remind you now that this is a mission of the highest potential danger. Your presence here in voluntary. If anyone wishes to withdraw, you may do so now without any prejudice. Very well. Zeta is important to us. It's our stepping stone to a new sector of the galaxy. We must find out what has happened to the previous crews, and bring it to a halt. As this is a signal red assignment, Mary has drawn your last wills and testaments from the file for your review. If there are any changes, please make them before you leave today. Also the standard Star Fleet life insurance policies have been drawn against your lives. Please fill in the appropriate spaces for beneficiaries, and sign them. Any questions? Very well. You will lift off at 0700, August 22nd, just a little over 36 hours from now. I wish you the best of luck. Good luck. - Oxygen levels? - Set to normal atmosphere. - Loading bay hatches? - Locked and secured. - Ignition sequence starts in five, six. - Five, four, three, two, one, mark. Ignition sequence begun. - Accelerators. Approaching maximum. - That's critical, now. - Take us out, Mr. Carey. Eyes are coming up on 65950, mark. (machinery whirring) (tense music) Is everybody okay? (Paul groaning) - I'm getting too old for all this foolishness. Every time out, it takes a little bit more out of this old body of mine. - Well your old body has about two days to get the creeks out of it, Paul. We make planet fall in 40 hours. Now we got a lot of work to do by then. All right, to begin with, let's ease off on formalities. First names make life a lot easier, and save time. Second, Gore, after this initial briefing, I want you to draw up a watch schedule for the remaining approach time. Eight hours on, and eight hours off. - Right sir. - I want you all to get as much rest as possible. There's no telling when we're going to get another chance. We found Zeta in the usual way, remote probes sensed an oxygen atmosphere. Touchdown began sending back basic planetary data. We believe it was destroyed shortly after that by volcanic activity. Then a manned mission was sent in, began to survey the planet, and when preliminary data indicated habitation possible, a pathfinder group was sent in. - Did the first survey ship have any problems? - No, but it was only on the surface for a week, and there was no trouble with the original pathfinder mission either. Zeta is an important planet to us. We haven't had too many opportunities to observe planets in their early stages of formation. But it's more than that. With Zeta as a star base, we can leapfrog from here to, who knows? They want construction ships in Zeta in two months, workers and colony ships in six. - Who are they gonna get to colonize that? - It has a very odd look to it. What's causing it? - A tremendous amount of fumes and vapor in the air. As you'll see when we land, your eyes will have some adjusting to do. We're dealing with a lot of irritants. Eye strain goes with the territory. Zeta's also somewhat larger than Earth, so the gravitational pull is gonna be stronger. You'll feel weak, until you adjust. - All hope abandon ye who enter here. - What was that, Linda? - Oh I'm sorry captain, day dreaming. - No, what did you say? - It was just a few lines from an early Earth poet named Dante. It was a work he called Hell. - Zeta is an Earth type planet. I stress the word type, the air is bad. There's a lot of vapor, nitrogen and oxygen in roughly Earth like proportions. The volcanoes are pumping out carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, and hydrofluoric acid. - And no preservatives? (Clark laughing) - Yeah, with no preservatives. It's toxic, but it's survivable. - Are you sure? - Our grandparents survived it 100 years ago, I think we can handle it. - In the 20th century, they lived with it all the time. - What were you talking about... - That's what they called smog. - Smog. - But I'd say that it's worse than it ever got on Earth. You'll be all right, as long as you don't do anything too strenuous. Heavy activity will leave you gasping, choking, you may even pass out. - What, no sex? - Gentlemen, come on! - All right, all right. For safety's sake, everybody will be required to wear breathing helmets and oxygen tanks. Stewart, will you outline the security precautions? - Certainly. As the situation develops on Zeta, we will adapt our behavior to meet the situation. Initial procedures are these: no one is to be alone at any time. No one. All personnel will wear side arms at all times. If anything appears out of the ordinary, communicate with Gore or myself immediately. No travel outside the compound, unless we know about it. We wanna know where you're going, and how long you'll be there, no exceptions. And of course, no travel outside at night at all. You see, we're totally interdependent on this mission. One breach of any of these rules may be fatal to all of us, therefore there must be no breaches. Questions? - Sigmund, how do you expect us to get any work done wearing guns all the time and not going anywhere? - Dr. Sisco, if these precautions are not followed, you may not live to do any work at all. - I don't understand what you're trying say. - Listen, I've had problems with you before. We don't know what we're up against on Zeta, and until we do, these procedures will be followed. - Mr. Stewart, if I may suggest a few changes in your procedures, I think that... - Doctor, if you required open heart surgery, would you trust me to perform the operation? - No, certainly not. - Why? - Because you wouldn't know what you were doing, and you'd probably kill me. - Well, for exactly those same reasons, doctor, you'll follow the security arrangements made by Gore and myself, to the letter. - All right, okay. Look, one last point, one that may be very important. It's the layout of the. (siren wailing) (tense music) - Automatic pilot, officer. You have control. - Acknowledge. What have we got, Gore? - I'm not sure, sir. Maybe a ship. Looks small though. - Set an intercept course. - Aye, sir. - Defense screens. - Primed and ready, sir. - Fire control. - Primed and ready, sir. Captain, can you tell what it is yet? - If we can get a visual. Gore, try the forward scanners maximum. Magnify. - It's an emergency beacon, sir. One of ours. Looks like it's orbiting around Zeta. Maybe from the planet or. - Is she transmitting? - Nothing, sir. Could be her solar panels are down though. - All right, let's get her aboard and pull the tape. (tense music) All right, let's see what we've got. - Here's the capsule. - All right, let's hear what's on the recording. - This is the last. We didn't know. Star Fleet listen, stay out of this hell hole. It's not worth the (coughs). The air is. Look, not much time. Don't send more people here to, they'll just end up like the rest, all emptied out and (coughs). My god, listen. - Just had time to send it off before, before what? And that noise in the background, any ideas? - I don't know that sounded like escaping gasses of some kind, perhaps volcanic activity. - And they may have been trapped by an explosion. - But that doesn't explain emptied out, or anything else, for that matter. - Plus there are no burn markings on the inside of the beacon. If there'd been an explosion, I'm sure there would be. These strange markings in here though. Carol, you have the facilities to analyze it. - Captain, there won't be any need for Carol to spend time on this. After a while, you get to know the way blood dries in space. - Still, let's check. - Certainly. - If it's blood, I wanna know if it's human. All right, planet fall will be in 1500 hours. Let's all do our homework. (tense music) - How're we doing, doctor? - Well, I don't know. The biological data seems to thorough and so complete. - Yeah, but what? - It's hard to believe that on a planet like Zeta, there's no life. Gore, what do you think? Are we really in as much danger as Mr. Stewart seems to believe we are? - Well was the blood on the satellite human, doctor? - Yes, yes it was. - I think we have to be very, very careful down there. Don't worry about it. We'll be able to take care of it, whatever it is. (gentle music) (Paul laughing) - Is that what you live for, Stewart? The guns. - It's what I do, Carey. I'm good at it. And I'm careful. It's why I'm still alive. - Well I'm thrilled for you. You sure the guns are gonna be enough? - They usually are. About these guns, one of them's yours. - What? - Want me to show you how to use it? - No, I think I can handle it, thank you. (Paul laughing) - That means you're gonna have to find another place to hang that tool belt... - No, no, no, Stewart. The belt stays on. I'll hang one of those little blow torches on it, if it'll make you feel any better, but the belt stay on, thank you. - As you wish. (gentle music) (Paul muttering) - Oh good. All right. (gentle music) - How long, captain? - 10 hours. - 10 hours 'til what? - I wish I knew. Why did you take this assignment, Linda? You know the dangers that go with signal red assignments. - Well when I was not more than five years old, my grandfather, oh he was on the first Venus project, and mission control. He sat outside with me one night, and we sat there, and one by one, he pointed out all the stars in the sky. Venus, Mars, Polaris, Regulus, Altar. Oh God, it was magic. And I said, "Grandpa, can you go there someday?" And he said "Yes, if you really want to, yes." So it doesn't matter what project it is, captain, signal red or any other kind, I live for this. - You may die for this, Linda. - Maybe. But I wouldn't regret it, not a minute of it. How about you, Captain Young? - I have no home. At least not in a sense that most people use the word. My home is... I belong here. - We're two of a kind, aren't we? - Yeah, I believe we are. (tense music) - Go ahead, Captain Young. - Commander, we have visual contact with the outpost. We're presently 120 units up, 30 minutes from planet fall. The outpost and the three ships seem to be secure. - You've received no communications? - In a way sir, we have. We took aboard a planetary beacon, it was in a high orbit. We've prepared a complete report. Prepare to receive high speed transmission. - Transmit when ready. (machinery whirring) Reception acknowledged. - This will be our last transmission for a while, commander. Request permission to land. - Permission granted. Need I say, be very careful. - No sir, you needn't. - But you know that I will. Be very careful commander, all of you. Good luck. - Thank you sir. - Communication link terminated. - I'll have that transmission transcribed, commander. - Immediately, please. Mary, tell me, what can we do that we haven't already done? - Nothing, sir. Nothing at all. (tense music) - Hold this steady, Gore. Are you reading the outpost landing beacon? - No sir, I'm not getting anything at all. I know it should be there but... - All right, I'm gonna take her in on manual. Release the automatic sequencer pole. - You have control, sir. - Acknowledge. (tense music) (ship whirring) - We have touchdown. All landing gear sensors indicate solid contact. Nicely done, captain. - Thank you Paul. - You're most welcome. - All right, secure ion accelerators. - Secured. - Power down. - Power down. - Let's go. (tense music) - Preliminary readings. Atmosphere within marginal limits. Wind and temperature satisfactory. Automatic sensors report no anomalies. - Thanks. (rumbling) - Captain, Linda, Carey, travel with Gore. Dr. Sisco with me. Stay close, no detours for any reason. - Put helmets on. All right, is everybody ready? - Captain. - Let's go. (tense music) - What an incredibly eerie place this is. - We didn't come here for a party. Just get the job done and get out of here. (tense music) That's strange. - What is it? - Just for a moment, I felt kind of strange. As though something was watching me. Crazy, it must be this place. (tense music) - Captain, you hear that? Listen carefully, just make it out. - Yeah, that kind of sighing sound we heard on the tape. I can't tell where it's coming from. Maybe it was a natural volcanic sound. We'll see if we can find it later. (tense music) - Turn on the lights. Right. Good. Cover me. - You're covered. (tense music) - Look at this. - What happened in here? - I don't know, check the oxygen support system. - Right. There. It's functioning. - Okay, come on. (tense music) Captain, the oxygen support system is activated. - Good, check the doors. - Right. - Please everybody be careful. - Yes sir. - Sisco, wait! (tense music) (Carol gasping) - You can take your helmets off. The air is okay. - You've got your work cut out for you, doctor. - What do you mean, Mr. Stewart? - You got some autopsies to perform. 11 of 'em. (tense music) - Oh my God. - 11. Just 11. Why aren't there 12? - There's something wrong with their uniforms. Look at their stomachs. (creaking) - Sigmund, take this one to the sealed lab. I'll make it my medical bay. And you better find something to put it in. I don't know what's going to happen if you just try and pick it up. - There's a stretcher in the mess hull, I'll get that. (tense music) - Did you know him, captain? - Yeah, his name was Komodie. He was a leader of the first rescue expedition, and he's my squadron leader at Al Terra 4. - Well I've got my work cut out for me. - What do think of this hole in the fence, Paul? - I don't know. Look, at first glance it looks like a chunk of lava rolled down slope and punched through, but look at the way the wires are broken on the end. It looks like it was made from the inside out. - Another piece of the puzzle? - Yeah. I'll see if I can find some material here in the bay to patch it. If not, I'll get something onboard ship. Either way, I'll get it fixed up. - All right, but do it tomorrow. It's dark now, and I don't want anybody out on the surface. - (laughs) I'm glad you said that, because I don't wanna be out there either. (laughing) (tense music) - What Linda and Carol have found is that this thing seems to be some kind of dissolving process. Starts with the soft tissues. The blood was drained from all the bodies. Also the contents of the abdominal and thoracic cavities. Also the organs, the lungs, everything. The brains too. There's just nothing there. - Are all the bodies the same? - No, there are three stages of decomposition. The stages correspond exactly to the mission personnel. The first mission, five out of the six showed the most deterioration. - Five? Who's missing from that group? - Dr. Christopher Kaywar, the geologist. Three men, first rescue mission showed less deterioration, and the second mission, less still. But whatever this thing is, it attacks the soft tissues, and then it moves on to the firmer cells. Maybe in time, even the skeletons would go, we don't know. - What's in the tray? - We don't know that either. Carol and Linda took these from the bodies. We think they have something to do with the dissolving process. These came from the first five bodies, these from the first rescue mission, and these last three from the second rescue mission. We don't have any idea what they are, or what they do, if anything. - Is there anything we can do now? - Not really. All we can do is just watch and wait. Carol and Linda are running some more tests back in the natural lab. After they get done with those, we'll send a preliminary report back to Earth. Until then, all we can do is just stay alert, and stay alive. (tense music) - Linda, Linda come here. Did you notice these marks? - No, no I hadn't. They must look like tracks or some kind, aren't they? - Yes they do. - And most of them seem to be leading to the outside wall here. - What do you think could have caused this? Do you think it could be animal? - I suppose it could be. That's odd. - What? - Do you smell fresh air? - Yes I do, but I wonder where it could be coming from. - I don't know, I don't understand it. - Linda, I think we should get some samples of this stuff. I'm going to check the lava bed outside. - You be careful. You don't have your oxygen on. - You're beginning to sound like our friend Sigmund. Well here goes. (ominous music) (heavy breathing) No! (Carol screaming) - Carol! Carol! (dramatic music) (gentle music) For the thousandth time, I don't know a shape. - What kind of shape? Fangs, claws? Must have seen something. - Nothing, just a hulky kind of shadow that, oh God. - All right, that's enough for tonight. - I'm just trying to get some information from her... - I know Sigmund, I know. - Captain, it's my fault. I should have anticipated we'd come under immediate attack, and set the perimeter defenses. Dr. Sisco is dead, and it's my responsibility. - No Sigmund, the point is not to go around blaming ourselves or each other. The point is not to let it happen again. Paul? - Yeah. - First thing tomorrow morning, I want you to set up the dimensional laser fence. - Sure, but that's not the problem. You see, the system is operating way below maximum, and I can't get it back up to normal levels. We're gonna have to watch our consumption, or we're gonna blow the entire system. - Can't you reroute it someway? - It's not just the rerouting. See that fence draws an awful lot of power. I could, I should be able to integrate the emergency power system so that if the fence does go down, we'll only be open for maybe five or 10 seconds. Yeah, I could cross the mains, so they'd kick back in, if it does go down. I have to rewire the fuses though, so if they go out, we wanna... - Paul, Paul, just do it, okay? Any way you can. And second thing, patch up that hole in the natural lab. - Okay. - Linda, are you all right? - Yes sir. It's just when I saw Carol... - Don't dwell on it. Is your report to Star Fleet ready? - The preliminary report is ready to send, yes. I just have to add the latest events. - Good. All right, as soon as it's ready, give it to Paul to tape and transmit. Paul. You take the first watch with Sigmund, 12 to four. Gore and I will take four to eight. Also, get a beacon ready to launch, and get Linda's data into orbit as soon as possible. - Okay. - And everybody, keep your weapons fully charged and close by. Looks like we're gonna need them. (rumbling) (tense music) - Damn it! (heavy breathing) (Sigmund yelling) (alarm beeping) - Door! No! (heavy breathing) (tense music) No! - There! - And now we are four. (Gore laughing gently) - He may have been cold and uncaring, but we fought together more than once, and we nearly died together more than once. (Gore laughing gently) Probably the best soldier Star Fleet ever had. Whatever did this to him will pay for it. (tense music) - All right. There are two priorities, first defense. It's getting near dawn. - Okay, first light, Gore and I will get the fence up. - Okay. Second, the outpost logs. Linda and I will start going through them day by day. - Yeah, there might be an answer in there as to what's happened. - Is happening. - One thing we know, those track like markings that Carol and I were sampling the night that she died, they seemed to be a trail of some kind, left by this thing. When it's fresh, it leaves a silvery look, like we saw next to Carol and Sigmund's bodies. It dries very quickly. If you see the silvery markings, it means it's a very fresh trail. - I want you all to make yourselves as comfortable as you can. The night comes very quickly. And if that thing tries anything tonight, we'll have a much better chance together. (rumbling) (tense music) - That's the last of the lasers. Do you wanna start setting up the fence now? - No, no, I wanna go back to the ship once more, and get that stuff I'll need to fit the hole in the natural lab. I'll need a welding torch, a few other things. Come on Gore, we both need the exercise. Nice brisk walk in the countryside, cheer you up. - (laughs) Cheers. - Where do we begin? We've got nearly two years of material here. - Yeah I know. We don't have time to go through it all. Let's start by dropping the first year. Then if we have to pick it up later, we can. Here. You take the scientific journals, I'll take the daily event logs. (tense music) - Hey Gore, where you going? Hey Gore, wait! (tense music) Gore! (Linda crying) - Linda, it'll be all right. - No. (Linda crying) Did you see them? Did you see them, all of them, emptied out on the inside, all of them. (Linda crying) - Yeah, I saw them. You wanna take a break? - No. No. There's something out there that's trying to kill us, and I'm not gonna let it. Get back to work, captain. There's not much time. - Yes ma'am. (rumbling) (tense music) - Gore. (heavy breathing) - They found life. - What? Linda, what did you say? - They found life on Zeta, at least evidence that there was life here once. Here, look at this. Found at the edge of a massive spatter cone, charred bone fragments of numerous small animals. Unfortunately not enough to make identification or drawings. Let's see. Here, look. Found an almost complete skeleton. Teeth indicate parallel to herbivore. So there must have been plant life here as well. - Also found what may be a gastrolith in the abdominal cavity. What's a gastrolith? - It's a stone in the stomach. Animals sometimes swallow it to help their digestion. Let's see. Skeleton back to lab for cleaning, preserving and tests. So they must all still be here. Should we look for them? - No, not yet. We're dealing with more than a small animal, so it's gotta be something else. Here, you keep working on this log. I'll look up the same date in mine, and we'll see what happens. This may be what we're looking for. (heavy breathing) (tense music) - Captain, it's here. It's all here. They did find life on Zeta. Not only did they find life, but they nourished it and made it grow. (heavy breathing) (tense music) - Gore, behind you! (gun zapping) (dramatic music) (gun zapping) What were they, Gore? - Animals, vegetables, I don't know. - You were following a trail. I think they laid that trail for you. I think the first one brought you in here, and waited until you got close enough to jump. These things think, Gore. - All right, I'll buy that. And the second one, he followed me in. - No Gore, it was already here, sitting tight until you went by, then waiting to slam the door on you if it had to. I guess I kind of screwed up the plan by opening fire from as long range as I did. Either way, it's getting late, and I don't think I want to be out here when it gets dark, not without a neutron throwing tank. Come on, let's go. (tense music) - Where'd you come from, anyway? - I saw you heading out. I shouted at you, but you didn't hear or didn't listen. I figured you might need some company, so I came along for the ride. - Glad you did. I owe you one. - Nah, we're even. Second one went over, there you go. You can buy me a drink when we get back to Earth, okay buddy. (heavy breathing) (tense music) - They were sectioning the gastrolith, when Dr. Murray, the physicist, noticed it was very different from the rest of the lava. And she opened it up with a carbon saw, and when she was taking it two halves out of the saw, she cut her finger. She says here that this sawed gastrolith was as sharp as a razor's edge. Some blood fell on both halves of the rock. - And the rock absorbed it, and it started to grow. Good Lord. - It was such a little thing, I mean a cut finger. When they saw what was happening, they decided to experiment. They began feeding it. It was a curiosity, just a wild curiosity. (sighs) And nobody knew a thing about it. - No one. They never said a word about life on this planet. Why? - I think I can explain that. I know, I knew Jack Mann, the expedition leader, pretty well. We shipped together on a Jupiter expedition about two years ago. He was the type of man who liked to hold everything in until he was absolutely sure of his ground, and then he'd let it all out at once, for the biggest possible impact. He knew how to make news, and a reputation. - Well though it might console him to know he's going to be in the headlines again, this is gonna be a very, very big story, if we ever live to tell it. Come on. Back to the books, Linda. - They grew quickly, gained what is probably their full adult size in six weeks. Diet, exclusively meat. - Seemed to possess a considerable intelligence. They show a remarkable trust, and apparently no fear of us whatever. - Test proceeding on schedule. Not yet determined biology of the beast. X-rays may show internal physiology and organs, if any. Externally they're amazing. Could we make use of these things? Perhaps a source of labor? Must explore that possibility. Partners, servants? Where would they fit in? They killed one. - They what? How? - They don't know how. It may have been the X-rays or possibly it was kept inside the outpost too long and suffocated. When they started an autopsy on the dead one. The other came into the sealed lab when they were working, and pushed up against the body, as if it was trying to wake it up. Kept that up for about 10 minutes. And they say here that it went crazy. It rushed around the lab, scuttled into the quarter, and went into the natural lab door. They opened the door for it, and it went straight for the mesh wall and broke through it, and disappeared. - The hole they never fixed. (heavy breathing) Three days after that Kaywar, the biologist vanished. From this account, the beast did too. They hunted him for two weeks, found his equipment south of the outpost, but no sign of him. - An eye for an eye? Did they kill him? I mean are these things capable of feeling grief and anger? A desire for revenge? - Maybe. They finally gave up on the hunt for Kaywar. Missing. - You heard that last part. Make that confirmed dead. Found about 1000 meters north west of here, at a volcano. - North west, but I thought figure six... - No, obviously they can move their victims. Remember how the bodies were spread out in the natural lab? Linda, keep digging. Now you two, tell me exactly what you were doing. - Probable cause of beast's death, asphyxiation. Zeta's air is tolerable for humans for short period of time. It works the same way for the beast in our atmosphere oxygen does to them what CO2 does to us, they think. Listen to this. The one that left reproduced. About a month after it disappeared, it came back with a small one beside it. They think it was some kind of asexual fusion, like an amoeba. Geez. Does that mean we have two of them to deal with? - We saw two. There may be more. - There's no way of knowing at this point. Let's assume two. Paul, what's the status on the directional fence? - Well I've got two more stations to install. - Gore, come with me, we'll finish that. Paul, I want you to do whatever rewiring you have to do to get that fence operational. - I'm nearly finished. - Paul, when you're finished, get a report together with the information that Linda's found so far. Get a capsule and get it in orbit. We've gotta get that information to Earth, as soon as you can. (rumbling) (tense music) - Our peaceful coexistence seems to have reestablished itself. So we are adapting to accommodate them. Today installed a special low touch plate in the natural lab, so they can come and go as they please. (rumbling) (tense music) - It's done. At least we'll be safe for the night. - I hope so. Captain? - What Gore? - Do you think we'll make it through the night, sir? - Well yes, of course, don't you? - No sir. I think we'll go down in style. - I hope you're wrong, Gore, I hope you're wrong. - We should do a sweep. Make sure we haven't locked one of those things with us. - That means separating. - I think it's worth the risk. - Let's test the fence as we go. - It's becoming more difficult to determine who are the testers, and who are the experiments. We are all acquiring a strong sense of being intently studied. The beasts have a capacity for learning, and they are learning quickly. They watch us, always. They analyze. They think. - How's it going? - Well they're definitely vulnerable to Earth atmosphere. You see they exhale a mixture of gasses as waste products, that's very close to what we breathe. They need a mixture of volcanic byproducts to survive, and the key element may be sulfur. - Sulfur? - Now Dr. Mann guessed, in spite of the outpost filter system, enough Zeta air must be getting through to keep them alive for up to something like two hours. - Two hours. - Without that trace of their natural air, they would last only about 30 minutes. And they have a oxygen atmosphere much less. - How about that? - So in other words, they eliminate what we would think was fresh air. - Yes, and that explains what Carol and I smelled in the natural lab, the night she was killed. - As in we take in a lot of nitrogen, but we get rid of most of it. - So they can't live on oxygen. - Yes, we couldn't live in a nearly total nitrogen atmosphere either. - So the same goes for them with oxygen? - Gore, that sighing sound we heard on the emergency beacon, and then on the way in. - They're breathing, and we thought it was coming from the volcano. That means the man who made that last tape was being attacked. - Why? - That's the big question. Did they ever find out why these things kill? - If so, I haven't found it yet. - It has to be in there. - Don't worry, we'll find it. All right, Linda, I want you to take a break. We're gonna have to be on watch 24 hours. Six hours on, and six hours off. - I'll take the first shift, sir. - And I'll join him. I wanna keep an eye on that rewiring we did. It's using a lot more juice than I thought. I tell you, we have got to keep everything turned off as much as possible. Our alarm system is really high. If anything penetrates it, we're gonna know about it. (tense music) (alarm whirring) - What is it? - I don't know. Something hit the fence, but there's nothing on the cameras. - Keep an eye on it for a couple more minutes. I'll be in my bunk. Shout if anything happens. (alarm whirring) (Gore sighing) - I think this is gonna be a very long night. (rumbling) (tense music) (alarm whirring) (alarm whirring) - We're in this. They just pick at us. Filthy. Stinking, cunning beast. They're thinking all right. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Just picking at us. Just waiting for us to make a mistake. Stinking, rotten... - Carey, Carey. - They know it! - It's not gonna do us any good... - I know, I know, I know. - Not you, not any of us. - No. (alarm whirring) (tense music) (alarm whirring) - What do you want, damn you, what do you want? Why do you wanna kill us? Talk to me! - Linda. - We know you're out there. We know you're there. Why? - That's enough. Now shut it down, Dr. Saunders, and I mean right now. (Linda crying) (gentle music) - I'm sorry. It's just that I didn't know all this was gonna happen. - I know. Nothing for us to do right now, except just hang on, and try and pull ourselves out of it. We can. - It's just that right now it doesn't seem like we have much of a chance. - No, no, these things are vulnerable. They can be hurt, they can be killed. We just have to figure out a way to trap them, so that we can. - There's always a catch, isn't there? (rumbling) - Busy night, huh Clark? How many more to come? - (sighs) Not many, Paul. With any luck, not any. We're down but not out. Our defenses are up, and we can prevent any attack. - Can we? We're rabbits trapped in a hole, with a dog sniffing all around us. - Even rabbits have teeth, Linda. You've been studying the test data. Where can we hurt these things the easiest? - Well, lasers will stun them, but it won't kill them. Heat, well enough flame will do the job, but I don't know how much. They've been living on this planet so long, they would have adapted to the high heat by now. I think our best bet is the air they breathe. They can't take Earth air for any length of time. - Let's think about that one. We have the main lab down the hall, now it can be hermetically sealed. If we can get those things in there, fill them full of oxygen, they'd suffocate, right? - That's an awfully big if, captain. That means opening up the outpost, deliberately letting those things in here. No sir, I think that's very dangerous to sent out an invitation like that. - But there's no reason for that. We've got three sealed labs outside right now. - The spaceships. - Yeah. Except for the one we need to get home, the other three are expendable. - Commander Craig would love to hear you say that. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You say we have three traps, Paul. Okay, how do we spring them? What do we use for bait? - The bait part is easy. It's me. - No! - No, it's gotta be that way, Linda. - Excuse me captain, she's right, you're needed here. Besides, I'm the one with the score to settle. - Don't make me pull rank on you, Gore. - No sir, I won't. It's my job. - Yeah, you're right. All right. The object is to lore that thing out there, and keep it in the spaceship until it suffocates. Now how do we do that? - Paul, we can activate the mechanisms on our ships by remote control, can't we? - Yeah. Yeah, the outer door, the airlocks, latches, sure. - Captain, you notice one of the ships still has her cargo ramped down. - Yeah, yeah it's probably because the guy who sent up the emergency beacon didn't have time to close it up. - Okay, try this. I go inside that ship, up the cargo ramp, turn the oxygen feed up to full. After that, I get in one of the airlocks to shut myself in. When the beasts are inside, I shut, and then from the control panel here, you should the ramp by remote control. I blow the airlock and bail out. Clean and simple. - Yeah, maybe too simple, Gore. How do you make it from here to the ship alone? - That might not be so easy. - No, it might not be, so you'll have to keep the cameras here on me as best you can and watch. - I don't think I like it, Gore. - Well I don't think that matters much, sir, with all due respect. Carey, I'd like to have a micro-camera on my helmet (rumbling) (tense music) - Ready? - As I'll ever be. - All systems check out, Clark. - Now. (laser beeping) Good hunting. - Please be careful. (heavy breathing) (gentle music) - Anything? - Nothing. - There! I think, yes, yes, there, I'm sure. - That would put it about 150 meters distant, at five o'clock. - Can't see it, captain. Was that a definite contact? - No, no, no. - Keep me posted. Picking anything up? - The same. Definite now. Maintaining your speed, the same distance. Now it's moved to seven o'clock. - Can you get a clear view of the thing? - No. It's like some chunk of lava decided to get up and move around. It's a perfect camouflage. This light is no good. - Gore, pick up the pace! He's closing in now, about 40 yards behind you. Nine o'clock, hurry up, man! - It's about 100 meters to go, captain. Am I gonna make it? - Yes, yes you're gonna make it. It's not coming any closer now. - Good. Hey by the way, just heard you say the target is out here. Confirm the sighting for me. How many on my tail? - We can only confirm one, Gore, but I'm sure they're both out there. - Yeah, they wish I were. (tense music) There, I think I saw one of them by the ramp door. (gun zapping) - Careful Gore, don't let it cut you off! (Gore panting) Gore, what happened? - I slipped on something. I'm all right. - Gore, there's a fresh trail from one of the beasts. It must be in the ship, get out of there! (gun zapping) - One of them's coming at you! (gun zapping) (tense music) Gore? Gore, what's happening? (Gore panting) (whirring) - Sounds like he's in an airlock. Why can't we see him? (static crackling) - I'm out now. I'm on the surface. I'm heading back. My laser's out of power. Leg, it hurt when I landed. Watch them for me. - Gore, I have them both on the screens and they're moving after you, fast. (heavy breathing) Keep moving and watch the fence as you approach it. We'll power down as soon as you hit it. - I don't think I'll make the fence, captain. - Try Gore, you will, you will. - What happened? - Too much light. Crack in the lava tripped me up. - Gore, we lost the picture for a while but we've got it back. - I'm done, captain. - No Gore, no you're almost home. Keep going, man. Keep going, man! - I don't know if I can do him any good, but I'm gonna try and get him some coverage fire. Watch the fence. I'll be busy. - Come on Gore, come on! (fence buzzing) - Now captain. (fence buzzing) (rumbling) They were too smart for us, captain. What do you wanna do now? (Clark sighing) - I don't know Gore. I never expected them to anticipate so far ahead. They out guessed us, set a trap for you, and it almost worked. - I think the only reason you did make it was that oxygen did get turned on, slowed them down, just a bit, but enough so they couldn't catch up with you. - Well, it rules out using the ships. You know what that means? - No, what does that mean? You wanna invite them in? Hey, come on in, have a seat. Have a cup of coffee. How's the weather? Here's my throat. The air, if you pardon the expression, has gotten to you, Gore! - What's that supposed to mean, Carey? You got a better suggestion, spit it out. - Yeah I do have... - Come on, come on! - A better idea, the way you're handling... - Come on, come on you guys! Cut it, cut it. Haven't we got enough trouble without fighting between ourselves? Is he all done? - Yeah. - How does it feel, Gore? - Yeah. I didn't know I had so many places that could hurt. - Why don't you take a break, Gore? You took a beating out there, internally and externally. Why don't you lie down for a couple of hours and recharge your batteries? You'll need it. And that goes for you too, Captain Young. And don't argue. Doctor's orders, gentlemen. Just do it. (ominous music) So that's it. That's why. - What the? - What is it, Paul? What's happening? - We've been running the ragged edge of it since we turned on that fence. Come on! Come on. Come on! (both sighing) (fence buzzing) Unless that thing's sitting right on top of the fence, I think we're okay. - Yeah, well let's hope so. Linda, what did you find out? - The lab test result books. It's all in here. They ran a final series of tests on one of the beasts. They got it into the sealed lab, closed the door, and then filled the lab with a high percentage of oxygen mixture. - And then what happened? (Linda sighing) - Beast became comatose. They sliced off pieces of living tissue, then they reintroduced Zeta air into the lab, and the beast revived. Right away it headed towards the natural lab, met the other, and they both left the compound. Now the first pathfinder group has been feeding these things for quite some time, so they've probably built up a store for themselves that will last them quite a while. - You heard about the living tissue samples they took, what happened to them? - They surgically removed the enzyme from it, and its metabolic rate slowed right down. It seemed to go into a kind of hibernation. It didn't die exactly, it just went dormant. And when they added a drop of blood to the tissue, it revived. - When the tissue sample became dormant, was there any exterior changes that took place? - Yes. It took on a pebbly service, a glossy black crust. It was probably some kind of protective crystallization. - That's right. Then that thing that they found was nothing more or less than an egg. - And sitting back at the CO lab, we've got 11 more, one out of each body. - Linda, how long was that thing gone when it disappeared, after the first one died? - They said about a month. - From the time we first lost contact with Zeta, through the two rescue missions until now, it's been just a little over four weeks, hasn't it? - My friends, that means that there are five more back in the lab, waiting to hatch. - And half a dozen more ready. (tense music) (beeping) (ominous music) Gore cover me. (guns zapping) Gore, stop fire. - Can you see? Watch yourself. (tense music) Oxygen, use the oxygen. Right at his face, right at his face. Look. (alien growling) (tense music) (oxygen hissing) (clattering) No! (Gore groaning) (oxygen hissing) (tense music) - Gore? Come on. - Clark, get out. Save yourself. (tense music) (Clark panting) (Clark yelling) - That's one of them. But he was right. I'm sorry Gore, you were right. (tense music) - Power, damn. The other one must have cut the power. Come on. (tense music) (heavy breathing) (gun zapping) I've got maybe four, five seconds left, and then we're down to one gun, Linda's, and that's not gonna do us much good. - I don't know what will. That thing's got us boxed in, and there's only one way out of here, down that hole. - Maybe not, captain. If you can buy us maybe 30 seconds, I might be able to get us out of here. - The vent shaft? - We can get through, I think, but it can't. I'll have to go first, because there's an atmosphere filter half way up, and the surface is a great bloody grid. - We'll need air. - Stay, keep it away from me. (gun zapping) Hold your fire! Here Carey, take this. - There's not much time. - There's no time for goodbyes now, doctor. We're not finished yet. Get in the shaft. - No, if it's gonna happen, it's not gonna happen in that black hole. - Come on! Go! (alien growling) (gun zapping) (tense music) Paul, your helmet! - I'll get it, I'll get it, now come on. - You can't make it on the ship without it. - I'll get it when we get out. Come on Saunders! - I'm coming. My god, my breathing tube, it's ripped. - It's all right, breathe easy, you can share mine. - Hurry up, I can't hold this thing all day. Give me a hand, give me a hand. - Paul, get the helmet. - My helmet. Go! (Paul yelling) - Oh my God, Carey! (rumbling) (tense music) They got him, but I don't see him now. The thing gonna come after us? God, what's it doing? - Come on, there's no time to think about it. We've gotta make it to the ship. - I won't, I won't without some air. (Linda panting) I won't make it. - There it is. For some reason it's staying with Carey's body. Maybe to feed. But it's after us now. - What it's doing, it won't let us reach the ship. It's driving us towards this volcano. We'll be trapped. It's closing in. What can we do? - Listen to me, we've only got one chance. I'm gonna show myself as a target. I'll lead the beast right over to the edge of the volcano, and I'll try to take it into the fire pit, and I might have to go with it, Linda. - No. No, please don't. There must be some other way, something else we can do. It'll kill you, just like the rest of them. - No, there is no other way. As soon as I start moving to the crater, make for the ship. The beast will follow me, and that should give you time to lock yourself in. Now, trade oxygen tanks and tubes with me. You're gonna need the air more than I am. - No. - Don't argue! There's no time. (Linda crying) (ominous music) (alien breathing heavily) (oxygen spraying) (rumbling) (ship whirring) And that's about it, commander. We'll be reaching warp speed soon, and heading home. - You've done well, Captain Young, and you, Dr. Saunders. My congratulations to you both. Be prepared for a long, long debriefing when you return. - We rather expected it, sir. - Well then I won't disappoint you. Once again, a job well done. - Thank you commander. - Communication terminate. (gentle music) (ship whirring) - There'll be no more beasts anyway, will there? - No. They're both dead. The eggs are destroyed. If there are anymore eggs left on Zeta, they'll lie dormant for a long, long time. According to man's studies, there hasn't been a living animal on the surface of Zeta in 100,000 years, until we came. No, no plant life, no animals, no enzyme, no beasts. - So, the supply ships and the colonists will start coming in? - In about two months. First thing they're gonna have to do is bring in three extra crews to get those ships back, and to take the bodies home. What does it matter? Two months, six, a year, Zeta will keep... (gentle music) - Captain. - Yes, doctor? (rumbling) (gentle music)
