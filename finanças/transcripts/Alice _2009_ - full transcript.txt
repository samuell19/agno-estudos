A new tea has just come on the market Ever get that guilty feeling ? Huh ? Maybe you abandoned the wife and kids and left 'em without a crumb to split between them ? Or maybe you killed someone ? A relative or a neighbor and it's left that niggling feeling in the pit of your stomach that's growing little by little into a dull, throbbing pain Gnawing away at you undermining your confidence and making you feel sick and worthless and fearful ? Well, fear no longer ! Because Clear Conscience has finally arrived ! The latest wonder of wonder from that remarkable wonder of all wonders the Hearts Casino ! This way Would you like a cup of tea ? No, thank you Who are you ? A friend I hope I run the tea shop See ? How did you break out of Scarab ? The beetle thing ? I used my hair pin and Fell ? As you can see, I'm drenched This place Where ! What is it ? Wonderland That's a story in a kid's book Does this look like a kid's story to you ? - No - It's changed a lot since then Oh, so you're saying that it was real ? You Oysters don't know how to find us, so, excuse me You tell yourself that we don't exist, and, quite frankly, - I like to keep it that way - Why am I an Oyster ? - This ? - That's not gonna come off Sorry Only people from your world turn green When burned by the light It's the Suits' way of brandin' their catch, and they call you Oysters because of the shiny little pearls that you all carry inside What do you mean, pearls ? She's Alice ! Tell him who you are Wow Really ? Ratty here thinks you're Alice of legend Who ? The last, um The last time a girl called Alice came here from your world, she brought down the whole House of Cards Oh, yeah Made quite an impression Although it was 150 years ago It can't be the same girl ! Oysters don't even live that long - I still want a good price - Wait a minute I am not for sale Not on the grass ! Alright Here we are Pink nectar Filled with the thrill of human excitement 50 Oysters were drained of every last drop of hullabaloo so that you, Ratty, can taste what it feels like to win just once Warning Don't take it on an empty stomach, and only one tiny little drop at a time, otherwise the experience might burst your shriveled-up little heart Got it ? - Got it - Good Go - He really smells - Oysters were drained ? What do you mean, drained ? Ratty tells me you're looking for someone His name is Jack Chase He was taken by a man with a white rabbit on his lapel I see The White Rabbit is an organization controlled by the Suits They travel back and forth through the Looking-Glass and vanish people from your world to ours Why ? To use in the casino Use ? Did I say use ? Slip of the tongue They're fine You know, they keep them alive, and moderately happy How do I get to this casino ? That's the thing, you don't Way too dangerous, but I know some people who know some well, other people If you know what I mean It's one of the privileges of running a tea shop Lighten up You should wear this It'll cover the glow and stop you from catching a cold I have a little money, but I understand you don't use that here ? Pieces of paper - Pointless - Then why would you help me ? Do I need a reason to help a pretty girl in a very wet dress ? I see You don't trust me Fine ! I am genuinely hurt Do you know why they call me Hatter ? Because you wear a hat ? No Because I'm always there when they pass the hat So to speak Philanthropy, generosity I mean, you, you can call it what you will It's who I am, and, right now, looking at you there, there's nothing I want more than to help you find - Jack - Jack ! And return you both to your charming world of children's stories I don't believe you I know what you're thinking If I'm the frying pan, then that, out there, is the fire I'll be square with you I know people who like to help your kind, and if, every once in a while, I scratch their back - They'll scratch yours ? - Precisely ! Lot of scratching Do try to keep up You're late I know I'm sorry Black Jack Black Jack Black Jack Everyone's a winner The time has come, Walrus, old friend, to test our many stills The oohs, the ahhs, the healing drops, the passions, the thrills and see how joy and awe and lust can all be turned to pills What is it ? Uh, the king requests your presence, Carpenter Thank you What's the matter ? I've got a thing about heights Why couldn't you guys build the city on the ground ? Look at me Alice ? Try not to look down Okay ? Scarab just brought in the last shipment of Oysters - How many ? - 20 Make the most of them We won't be getting any more until we find that ring and restart the Looking-Glass There was just enough juice left in it for the last sortie, and the queen would like you to harvest more unusual emotions It, It's difficult enough getting the simple ones You know it takes a thousand thrills to make just the tiniest drop People want to experience more exotic wonders Surprise adoration ecstasy calm Elation ! Now, keepinf the masses happy is a very great responsibility, Carpenter, and one that weighs heavy on my shoulders If our people don't feel what they want to feel when they want to feel it Well, the whole system breaks down ! Instant gratification is a very complex business That's why we have to keep moving forward, forever discovering more exotic wonders Ah ! There you are ! Oh, joy Oh, bright day ! Finally, and at last ! Oh How do you open this thing ? I don't know, Majesty Well, there's a hidden catch somewhere, but I can never remember ! Okay Summon the Queen 17 ! And 10 !

We have a conscious one here I better see if I can find the car I can't move my - What's going on here ? - Ma'am ? Oh ! Hello !

You don't need to bother with technical things like that, ma'am What's wrong ? She's regaining her faculties Do you know my name ? Something beginning with a B, I think Take her to the waiting room Come with us Did you talk ? You shouldn't have talked I was worried about my kids We all have family somewhere - I got to find my car - You can't leave None of us can I'm returning a library book It's a work of Edwin and Morcar How does the little crocodile improve his shining tail ? He pours water of the Nile on every golden scale Come on, be quick Hello, duck It's all right Wait Why don't we just put these things away ? - Come on, you know me well enough - We have our orders Keep that right hand where we can see it ! It's just flesh and blood Right We've all seen what you can do with that sledgehammer Did you like the box of comfits I brought you guys last week ? The cured meats and the cheese ? They're all gone Well, if you don't treat me with a little respect, you won't get another crumb Sorry, Hatter Everyone's a little jumpy Everyone's always a little jumpy Where are we ? The Great Library There's 5,000 years of history hidden here Art Literature Law Rescued when the Queen of Hearts seized power She'd like nothing more than to see this burnt to nothing Who are those poor people ? Refugees Those who don't want to be a part of Queen's world of instant gratification We give them shelter and try to feed them as best we can, but it is dangerous If the Queen found out, they wouldn't stand a chance Why does she want to destroy all of this ? Wisdom is her biggest threat She controls people with a quick fix How are all my lovely Suits today ? We are very happy, ma'am How nice You're all so clever and pretty We've found the Stone of Wonderland Where is it ? We will have the Looking-Glass up and running in no time, and, this time, we'll pull in 50 or 100 Oysters a day What a charming practical joke My dear ? Why am I not surprised ? The girl ! The ring, Alice Girl ? Agent White took the box from a girl, an Oyster She must have the ring Yes Where is she now ? She um escaped What exactly do you mean, escaped ? Some of the honeycomb containers are getting a little old We have renovations planned in next year's budget, but An Oyster is running around Wonderland with my ring ? - We'll find her ! - Oh, we'll find her, all right But you, Agent White, will take no further part - His head, ma'am ? - Yes, of course What else ? His foot ? I'll put all Suits on standby No ! It will only alert the Resistance The last thing we want is to feed that riff-raff a grain of encouragement No, we need someone who can work quietly, behind the scenes Someone cold-blooded, ruthless criminally insane Is Mad March alive yet ? She's looking for her boyfriend, a Jack Chance Chase His name is Jack Chase She needs help - I thought of you, Dodo - Really ? And why would I want to help your Oyster when you know that bringing her here puts us all at risk ? Oh, please I've spent years smuggling more dangerous things than this down here You know what rankles most about blood-sucking carpet baggers like you, Hatter ? Your gall While we risk our lives trying to bring freedom to ungrateful leeches like you, you swan about, living the good life Stop your crowing You know I'm on your side I'm sure you say that to all your enemies I do what's necessary I kiss what butts need kissing so your machine stays oiled Look, if you can't help me, I'll just leave Headstrong, isn't she ? Can you help me get Jack out of the casino ? I don't see how The resistance has contacts inside the casino, right ? No comment Use them to find her guy She can pay you, but I want my usual cut up front Pay me ? Pay me with what ? Show him the rock, Alice What ? The ring on your finger No, that is off limits ! - It's all you have, Alice - No ! It's not possible Where did you get it ? It's none of your business It's not for sale - Where did you get it ? - What what is it ? Your Oyster is wearing the Stone of Wonderland ! - It's impossible - I'm never wrong Where did you get it, Alice ? - Jack gave it to me - Jack ? Jack Chase, the guy we're looking for - Well, where did he get it ? - I don't know ! - Give it to me ! - No ! - Take her out ! - Are you crazy ? Stop ! Just wait ! You're in way over your head, Hatter Just give me one second to talk to her, okay ? It controls the Looking-Glass You know that Calm down Put the gun away I'm sure we can all get what we want here Look, no one is getting this ring ! We've been waiting for years for a break like this, and now it falls into our laps Stop waving that thing around You're scaring everyone ! If we can return the Oysters back to their world, maybe we can save ours Just put the gun down ! Think about it ! The Queen reduced to mopping floors It'll be just like the old days Justice, reason and the rule of law ! Stop this ! No ! You shot Hatter ! We don't need him anymore The ring is our ticket out of here Leave her alone or believe me, the next one will be aimed at your head ! Look Hatter, this is a game changer I'll give you three times your price 5 ! 10 ! You name it ! Back off ! If you let her leave with the ring, I'll have every member of the Resistance hunting you down You'll be dead before teatime ! and that's the thanks I get, huh ? For keeping you bums fed and watered all these years ? Hatter ! It's the blue button ! Go, Alice ! Hurry up and push the blue button ! Go ! Lucky Come on, Hatter How did you do that ? No ! How bad is it ? Body armour You're not even wounded You lied to me ! - I was trying to help you - By selling my ring ? I didn't know it was the Stone of Wonderland, did I ? Well, you could have asked me before bringing me here He wouldn't have come You're damn right, I wouldn't He almost killed me ! - Yeah, well, he actually shot me ! - Yeah, now tell me the truth What is the Stone of Wonderland ? It's a big deal It was mined by the ancient knights to power the Looking-Glass The door that connects our world to yours Knights ? They were wiped out a long time ago by the Queen She took the Looking- Glass and of course, the Stone How did Jack get hold of it ? What now ? The Queen wishes to know whether you've revived Mad March The Queen's favorite assassin ? Oh yes, of course Yeah No, I'm still working on it Where is he ? Where's his head ? That's the part I'm still working on Well, I'll try to arrange an extension of, say, an hour Are you kidding ? This will take weeks - Well, the Queen wants him now - Tough ! The bio-molecular transfistropia is a delicate and complex process which requires time Besides which the subject is dead Is that what you'd like me to tell the Queen ? - Tough - No, but Then have him ready in an hour Whoa Where do you think you're going ? Anywhere, but here There are no, go areas in this town I don't believe this is happening I mean, this place, you people I mean, this is all too weird Listen, calm down I'm going to try and get you home, okay ? - Really ? - Yes, really I could Could you just keep still ? And what's in it for you ? Let me guess, you want your usual cut up front ? I don't blame you for being angry - I acted impetuously - No, selfishly You acted selfishly ! Whatever word you want to use ! Let me make it up to you Alice, this is a dangerous place Trust me, you're gonna need my help Well, where is he ? I don't see him Before I present Mad March, I, I feel I should warn - Prepare you - What ? In the interest of expediency, I've had to make some technical adjustments What are you talking about ? Shortcuts How short ? What on Earth have you done to him ? Uh, think of him as a hybrid, Majesty In many ways, he is better than before We don't need a user manual, do we ? I hate user manuals Not too close He's still finding his way Does he have all his old skills ? Forensics Tracking Homicidal mania ? I believe so Believe so ? There wasn't much time for testing Does he speak ? Let's try him out, then Mad March How are you today ? Piss off, you cow Excellent ! He's good as new ! Now then Marchy, I need you to find someone A girl Not interested I see How disappointing Well, in that case, we'll just have to find another use for you Lets put him in the gaming room, where the geeks can have fun with him What ? What else am I to do with you ? I'm devastated truly Aw, that's too bad Take him away He's obviously past his prime Okay, okay ! Tell me about this broad The Looking Glass is the only way to get you back home And it is here in the city, but it's the most heavily guarded piece of kit in Wonderland I've got to find Jack first Have you not heard a word I've said ? I don't know how he got mixed up in this, but I know that he's not a thief He was trying to surprise me, or sweep me off my feet, and so, somehow, he got a hold of this ring, and it has landed him in a pile of trouble If it wasn't for me, he would be home safe How did he get hold of it ? Well, I don't know The point is I'm the only one who can get him out of this mess How'd you figure that out ? Well, I've got the ring I can use it to negotiate his release - Oh, no, no, you - No ? No, you can't negotiate with the Queen She's crazy You have to cut your losses You get the hell out of here while you still can No, I can't just abandon Jack I mean, he's innocent And besides, I like him Oh, you like him ? Yes A lot ! Trust me, I, I know a thing or two about liking people, and, in time, after much chocolate and cream cake, like, turns into, what was his name again ? No, not in my world Look, I have a bad record with liking guys There's a shock Well, and this is the first one that has meant anything There's no way that I'm going to give him up now Stay close Hey Hey ! Look at me ! Did you see her ? Hey ! Get out of here ! Hey, you ! What about you ? What did you see, huh ? Wait, wait, wait, wait I asked - She told you she was Alice - Yes If you work with rats long enough, you can turn into one, eh ? What is that ? Nothing I've ever seen before Wait No, it can't be Sir ? Sir ! Suits ! Sir ? What ? We should run Run ! Quickly ! Come on ! That way Down here ! My smuggling boat Quickly ! Hang on There's a knack to this Which, apparently, I've never learned ! Come on ! At last ! I'll call for a Scarab Where is the casino ? I already told you can't negotiate with the Queen But The White Rabbit is a different kettle of onions Perhaps they'll do a deal It's a long shot, but it's the only one we've got We ? I don't think you know this, Alice, but my shop was ransacked I'm homeless I am a target now, not only for the Suits, but for the Resistance as well, and there's only so many places in Wonderland that I can hide The way I see it, I've only got one option - Which is ? - Go back with you to your world Before we do anything, we have to shake that royal flush They are heading for the shore I don't know who that weirdo is leading the posse, but he's got one hell of a nose for blood And this is the place to find it What was that ? There's things in these woods that defy imagination Come on, we haven't got much time Look We can't shake the posse We can't fight them either There's only one thing left to try What's that ? Lead them into a trap Keep your breathing shallow Did you hear that ? Yep, you should find a tree that you can climb What ? Why ? The trap we talked about ? This is it I'm the bait Go ! Wait ! What is it ? Tell me ! It's a Jabberwock What ? Alice, less of the questions Just get going You're going to lead this thing back to the posse ? Yes, after he gets a good look at me ! Now, could you just please go ? That's your plan ? If you don't Run Not that way ! Alice ! Hey ! Come on ! You okay ? - Yeah - Good Come on ! You okay ? Just about Stay still Vermin ! Saboteurs ! Anarchists ! I was this close to catching him ! This close ! Degenerate bag heads ! That's it This way Saboteurs ! Pig pushing clots ! Bug bashers ! Who the hell are you ? I am a knight The White Knight, to be precise Sir Charles Eustace Fothoringhay Le Malvois the Third Who are you ? I'm Alice Alice ? The Alice ? The Alice ? No Just Alice Just Alice ? I thought all you guys were wiped out years ago Well, you thought wrong As you can see, I'm as fit as a butcher's dog Are there any others like you ? Certainly not ! I'm a one-off My nan used to say that if I were the only eligible bachelor left in the world I'd be an old maid Or wall flower who'd polish my escutcheon No, I meant are there any other knights in these woods Your comrades in arms ? Heavens, no Are you mad ? We were all wiped out years ago You dug that pit on your own ? You think I'm too old ? Well, let me tell you something, knugface Youth is vastly overrated ! I may have put on a few years, but I'm crafty I have a very inventive and calculating mind thats high with groundbreaking state of the art ideas I invent all sorts of things The beehive mousetrap, for instance This here pit, as you so rudely call it, is in fact my third attempt at the gravity assisted snare, Mark IV He's mad as a box of frogs How the hell have you survived ? Oh, yes ! I am a knight And I'm an inventor, as I said, but, if I'm honest, It's strictly only on a part time basis You don't say ! And I dabble in the black arts, now and then Soothsaying toenail readings, That sort of thing Here, let me show you ! Give me your palm Get off ! What's that on your finger ? Nothing It's the sacred ring The Stone of Wonderland Our ring ! Don't get too exited, grand dad The ring stays on the lady's finger, okay ? It is meant to be ! This time, this place, this meeting in the woods Okay, we need to get away from him before he gets us killed But maybe he can help us Have you forgotten about the weirdo that's tailing us ? This freak show is going to draw his attention for sure If this knight has survived out here for this long, maybe he knows a thing or two Listen, Charlie, we have some very bad men following us who want to kill us and steal the ring Do you know anywhere we can lay low for a while ? The stars are aligned in a cosmic ray of hope ! And you want to put your faith in him ? Yes He might be nuts and 150 years old, and dressed like a car crash, but he's a survivor And I'm not deaf ! Just Alice I will be honored to escort you, your goods and vassal to my sacred kingdom Did he just called me a vassal ? Even works over mud Wiping the tracks clean away Maybe senile Sam does have a trick or two up his, uh Escutcheon Welcome to the Kingdom of the Knights Well, well What do you know Before the war, with the Queen of Hearts this was once the greatest city in the realm The Red King and his elected council ruled Wonderland with the wisdom of the ancients And the Hearts destroyed everything ? We lived in harmony for a thousand years, but when the queen came to power She just wanted to feel the good not the bad Believe it or not, this was once the throne room Sadly, all that's left now is the throne That was good, Charlie What was it ? A barbecued borogove They're the devil to catch, but well worth the trouble, don't you think ? When in Rome Shan't be long What I want to know is how we're going to cut a deal with the White Rabbit I did say it was a longshot but as long as you got that ring, you've got a chance You ! What happened to we ? I can't leave, Alice Wonderland's my home I can't just abandon it, despite what I said I have to stay and fight What ? Seeing all this, Look This great kingdom and what, what has become of it It's a wake-up call, to be honest My people I mean, the hundreds of refugees that are all hiding underground, they're all counting on me Didn't that Dodo guy Say he was going to have you hunted down and killed ? Yep But I'm thinking if I turn up with the ring, he might forgive me So that's what this is about Don't worry I'll get you home, safe and sound first And Jack ? You have to forget about Jack We'll never get him out of the casino alive and trying, it's only going to set off alarm bells That will make your escape impossible ! Okay, so you were just leading me on, back there ? Just believe me It will be suicide Jack's a lucky guy What ? Nothing Look, it's late And we all need our rest We can argue about this tomorrow Yeah ? Dinah ? Dinah You're alive ? What are you doing here ? Dinah Dinah ? Dad ? Dad ? Daddy ? Daddy What was that ? That's the Early Warning System ! Someone has broken through the perimeter ! Where's Alice ? Battle stations ! Sound the order of Seraphim ! Drum ! No No ! I need a horse Which way should we go ? You don't have to come, Charlie This isn't your fight You couldn't be more wrong ! You led the Alice of legend to me for a reason Call it what you will, Divinity, fate, An alignment of forces beyond mortal understanding In time, you'll see that I am the true paladin here, and you are merely a harbinger And besides, you You'll never find her without my help Remember I'm also well versed in the black arcs We shall be guided by my psychic connection to the mysterious things that bind mankind to the outer realm Galadoon de Booshe You're going the wrong harbinger ! We should go West You go West I'm going East Why ? She's going to the Hearts Casino But that's certain death Why would she go there ? Hello, Alice ! You look like you can use a little company She's lying, of course We could search her again, of course More thoroughly It won't do any good Oh, I don't know about that Winston ! Where did you hide it, girl ? I told you, I don't know what you're talking about I've never worn a ring in my life We know Jack gave you the ring, Alice The White Rabbit told us, heaven rest his soul But the question is ! Did you leave it in your world ? Winston, you idiot ! Now she knows we don't know whether she brought it with her ! Ah, that's right Sorry, dearest This interrogation bussiness is very tricky Wait ! Is she really that clever ? Oh, yes I think she just may be You walked into Mad March's trap on purpose, didn't you ? You wanted him to catch you, because you didn't know your way here You'd only do that, of course, if you'd hidden the ring first, somewhere very discreet Am I right ? Your plan was to cut a deal with one of my cohorts Make your demands, and return the ring only when they'd been met But suddenly, you find yourself face to face with the Queen of Hearts herself The most powerful woman in the history of literature and you don't know whether you can go through with it You've lost your nerve That about sums it up, doesn't it ? No No ? I haven't lost my nerve Now we've got her where we want her So, then, Alice, my dear What are your demands ? I want you to free my boyfriend, Jack Chase, and send us both home When we're certain that we're safe, I'll tell you where the ring is I see Number nine Go and fetch this Jack Chase But, ma'am Do as you're told What a coincidence It appeares that Jack Chase was waiting just outside the door Me wonders why Jack ? Are you alright ? I'm fine, what are you doing here ? We found her running around the forest all on her tod, so I brought her here I was very curious to see what sort of tart my son is hanging around with these days Son ? You're her son ? His real name is Jack Heart He lied to you about that too - Mother - Don't mother me, you odious quizling Your girlfriend has hidden the Stone of Wonderland out there in the bushes somewhere She's not my girlfriend She's nothing to me Jack ? So why did you give her my ring ? As I've said a thousand times before, I didn't gave it to her, she took it She was an affair, that's all Someone to pass the time with while I explored her world I took the ring, so's to be certain, I'd have the power to return Little did I know, she'd go through my things while I slept Alice Tell us where you hid the ring What ? I didn't ask you to come here I certainly didn't ask you to hide the ring, so Come on Tell everyone where it is I won't tell anyone where it is until you've taken me home Perhaps that's not such a bad idea If I take her home, you'll be sure to get it back Brilliant The only little niggeries Well, I wouldn't trust you if you told me the sun was round Sadly, we've had to shut the Looking Glass altogether now I'm sure we can run over the lovely girl without having to go all the way back to smelly old home sweet home Ah, look who's here Duchess Majesty, meow Jack, have you nothing to say to your fianc? ? What ? Don't tell me Jack forgot to mention his life long love, his wildly romantic engagement and upcoming wedding ? So this is I'm afraid so Really ?

He thinks you're the most gorgeous creature in the world That's why he's marrying you You see, Alice, dear, Jack's been engaged for months now His flight through the Looking Glass was no more than a diversion, a stag spree, a wave goodbye to his mischievous youth You're going to tell us where you hid the ring and then you're going to wish you had never laid eyes on my son Well, I'd better run Goodbye, Alice I forgive you for taking the ring I know you're upset with me And I don't blame you He's here Goodbye Duchess ? Take her to the Truth Room Yes, ma'am Dad ? Daddy ! Keep moving He's here Who is she, Jack ? Jealous ? Of course I am Then help get me out of here You know I can't do that, but, maybe if you tell me what you're up to I'm not up to anything Darling, maybe we shouldn't have any secrets between us I know what you're thinking, but it isn't so, know how Contrarywise, if it weren't so, it might be and if were so, it would be but as it isn't, it ain't That's logic I am Dr Dee, and this is my brother Dr Dum Our job is to open you up, pull everything out, until we find the very thing we're looking for Relax Let your mind go Allow yourself to fall into a deep sleep Dad ?
