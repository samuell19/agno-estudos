My name's Peter. This is my best friend, Dave. - Hey. This our friend, George. - What are you doing? - Well, I was just setting the scene, introducing myself, my friends, trying to keep things a little exciting. - Don't do that. I know who you are, Peter. - Oh. Okay. Whatever. - Peter, why are you here? - I really have no idea. - Has something happened? - Yeah, you could say that. - Why don't you tell me what has happened, Peter. - Okay, but if I'm gonna tell you everything that happened, the first thing you need to know about is the cabin. And, this is the cabin. Every summer, Dave, George and I go to the cabin and have the time of our lives: drinking, playing games, more drinking, George trying to kill me-- - George tried to kill you? - Well, yeah, sure, of course, but that was only because I just... Where to start, where to start. I guess, looking back, it really all started the day of Steve's Halloween party. - What are you gonna be, what are you gonna be, what are you gonna be, what are you gonna be, what are you gonna be? - Vampire. - Terrible. - What? Surprise hug. - What are you gonna be? - That's a surprise, too. - All right. - Hey, buddy, did you ask out that mystery chick yet? Not yet. I had tried to ask her out before with mixed results. - Yeah? Listen, I don't know how you got this number, I don't care whose father you are, stop calling this office, all right? And, love you, Dad, bye. Hi? - Oh, uh, hi. Hi, Susie. Halloween, Halloween party. I'm going to a Halloween party, tonight. - You must be very excited. Well, these files aren't gonna file themselves. - Uh huh, they must be very important. - Hello? Who the fuck is Joseph? Oh, you're Joseph. - Oh, not yet, what are you waiting for? It's so easy. Just be confident and assert yourself. I've told you this before, watch. Hi. - Fuck off. - My name's George Sullivan. Do you watch the show Friends? - I don't have a TV. Do you like to eat food? - I actually love food. - So do I, do you want to get dinner sometime? - Yeah, why not? - Okay, what's your name? - Jade, hi. - Jade, okay. Find me on Facebook, okay? - Okay. - It's George Sullivan. - George Sullivan? - Right. - Bye, George Sullivan. - You are the master, how do you do that? - It's just a matter of confidence. It works on guys, too. - What? - Huh? - Are you still seeing Carol? - No. - I thought you liked her. - I did. Now, I like somebody else. - You ever think you'll meet someone who you don't dump in a month? - No, my old Pappy told me, "Rent, don't buy." - You told me your old Pappy was an idiot. - Yeah, but he's like family to me. - You guys still goin to Steve's, right? - Yeah, wouldn't miss it. - Okay, I'll see you there. I have some business to attend to. - I'm gonna ask her out, I'm doing it. - Who? - Susie! - Oh, the mystery girl? - That's right. - Okay. - She's sitting right over there and talking to George. She's talking to George. Why is she talking to George? - Oh, my God, you're so adorable, like a dolphin. Seriously, though, I'm going to a party tonight at my friend Steve's and I want you to be my date, so say, "Yes." - I don't know. - Say, "Yes." Yes. - All right. - All right, excellent, eight o'clock. - Sure, why not? - Great. Hi! - Oh, Peter, hi. You know Peter? - Yeah, we work together. - Hi! - Smooth. Hi, I'm Dave; I'm Peter and George's friend. - Hi. - So, so, so Susie, how do, how do you know George? - Oh, we just met. - Just met? You just met, that's insane. Did you hear that, Dave? They just met. - I heard. - Susie's coming with me to Steve's party. - Is she? That is great. That's, that's great. - What's his problem? - Just a matter of confidence, like I said. Now, ask out that mystery girl. - I'll be sure to do that. - See you later. Shall we? - Okay. - I'm not going. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm really not. - No, you gotta go; you'll have fun. If you don't, we can leave, I promise. - You'll leave if I'm not having a good time? - I promise. Fine. I'm not having a good time. What? - I'm not having a good time. - We've only been here five minutes. All right, look, I'm going to tell you this as a friend, but staring at two people making out at a party is really weird. - You're right. Can you believe him? I said I was dressing as a vampire, so what does he do? He dresses as a vampire, only, he's a sexy vampire. You think George is sexy? What, no! Hey look, it doesn't matter, 'cause how long hae we known George? And, in all that time, how long has he been with a girl, maybe a month at the most? So, just relax. It's fine. Let's have fun, 'cause not to sound cliche, but there are are plenty more fish in the sea. And, by sea, I mean this party and by girls, I mean fish, right? So, let's see each other at the bar. You go, yeah, yeah. - All right, I'll see you there. * All I know to make you * Make it easy to say no to me - Who are we staring at? - And, that, that is the first time I met Nancy. And, I, I didn't know it at the time, but she almost didn't even come to the party. - Uh, Nancy? Oh, close your eyes. - Seriously? - Seriously, close 'em. - Uh, fine, they're closed. - Okay, open them. * What do you think? - Adorable. - What are you gonna wear? - Uh, where? - To the costume party. - Uh, right, the costume party. Um, about that. - Mary? - I can't go. - Oh, why? No, the only reason I said I'd go to this stupid party is 'cause you said you were going. - I know, I really wanted to go. - Okay, then go! I, I, I am literally begging you, please do not make me go to this party alone, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. - Aw. Oh my God and now you're laughing at me! - No, I'm not, I'm taking this very seriously. - So, you'll go? - I, I'm sorry, I can't. - Why not? - There was an explosion in the lab. Cheryl's in the hospital. - So? Uh, she's pretty banged up. - It's Cheryl. - She might not make it. - Fine, I don't know if I want to go to the party, now. - No, don't do that. You're already all dressed up in your very cute ladybug costume. - It is pretty cute. It is. - I don't know. - You're gonna go to that party, you're gonna have a great time for the both of us and then, tomorrow morning, you're gonna call me and tell me all about it. Come on, do it for Cheryl. - Oh, fine. - I'm wondering when they're gonna come up for air. - That's Susie Smith. Oh, she works in my building. Could be a while. She's very pretty. - Yes, she is. I guess, I mean, not as pretty as you. - I'm Nancy. - Uh, hi, Peter. - Nice to meet you, Peter. - It's nice to meet you, Nancy. Can I get you a drink? - Sure. - She's a lady, but she's a bug. Oh, fuck. - It's true. - You gonna be okay getting home on your own? - I'm good, I'm great, I'm good. Listen, you need to forget about what's-her-name because Nancy's hot. You can't do better than that. Look at yourself. Look at you, you mess, she's, she's way better than you. Don't tell her. And, you, be nice to my friend; he's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy, just don't be a meanie, okay? - I'll do my best. All right, I love you. I love you. - Oh. - Be good. God bless you guys. - Aw, your friend really cares about you. - Yeah, Dave's the best. I've known him forever, so-- - He would be perfect for my best friend Mary, but she is dating some asshole right now. - That's too bad. - Yeah. So, this girl that Dave wants you to forget about, it wouldn't be Susie, is it? Because, she is a real heart breaker. - Was I that obvious? - Well, the way you were staring at them, it was either Susie or George and I hope it's not George, 'cause-- - It's Susie. - Look, Nancy, I had a great time tonight and I really, really didn't think I was going to, so, thank you for that. You're welcome. So, this is my place. Do you want to come up? - You're not the type of girl who's just gonna use me for my body and I'll never see you again, are you? - What body? - Ouch, oh, - Oh, ouch. - Very hurtful, very hurtful. - You're not getting rid of me that easy. - I know, I know, I'm late. Sorry, had a crazy day at work and you wouldn't believe the traffic. Oh, are we going on a trip? Then, what's with the bag? - I'm not happy. Are you happy? - What, what's going on? - This isn't working anymore. - Are you leaving me? - Think of it as a trial separation. - Oh God, you are leaving me. I'm not happy. - You're not happy, so you just pack your bag and go? - It's not my bag, it's your bag. Why would you pack my bag? - I'd like you to leave. - You're kicking me out of my house? - It's our house, Peter, our house. - Just talk to me, Nancy. We've talked. We've talked so much. - Yeah, and I thought things were better. We, we were meeting with Dr. Gordon and he had some interesting ideas and I thought thought things were better. - They're not. Peter, you lost your-- - I know, I've lost a little hair, but I think it's just thinning. There's nothing I can really do about that. What, what do you want, Nancy? - Peter, just go. She just left you? - Yep. - She kicked you out of the house? - Yes. - What did you do? - What do you mean, what did I do? - I, I just thought things were better. - Me, too. How many of those have you had? - Not enough. - I'm sure she just needs a few days to cool off and then you'll be fine. You'll be back in the house before you know it. - What's with your watch? - My watch? - You keep checking your watch. - It's nothing, it's just, I got a thing with Mary and her parents later, it's okay. - You're gonna leave me now, just like Nancy. - I'm not gonna leave you, I'm, I'll stay right here. It's just, we were planning this for a while and Mary was looking forward to it, but it's okay, I'll stay right here with you and then she'll realize that she can do better than me and she'll leave me and I'll be alone, just like-- - Forget it, forget it. Go be with your girlfriend and her family. - Thank you, muah, you're the best. - You're a terrible friend. - You don't mean that. Yes, I do mean that. I love you, too. I will have another of those and your number. Fair enough. You can't do that, pass. We were on a break. Oh, come on, Rachel. - George? - What's up? - We need to talk. - Okay, talk. - Well, we've been together for four years and I was wondering if you thought about where we might be going as a couple. - I had a feeling this conversation was coming. - All of our friends are married or getting married. - False, Dave and Mary, not married or gettin' married, like you say. - They've only been together for a few months. - Right, my point is, Dolphin, they're not married, okay. Do you ever think you want to get married? - Susie, I'm watching Friends. - George, this is important. - No. - No? You never wanna get married? So, you don't want to have kids? - Is this about kids? 'Cause, I promise you, you do not have to be married to have children, okay? This is a medical... Have you been poking holes in my condoms? - What? - It's a guy's number one fear, behind alien abduction, crazy girl pokes holes in a guy's condoms. - That has never happened. - Oh, yeah, it has happened, 'cause I Googled it, okay. Can I put my program back on? - And, that's what you think of me, I would do that, to what, to trap you? - It's not what I think of you; it's just all this marriage talk gets me thinking, you know? - And, you think I'd do that to you? - I would hope that you wouldn't and I know that you wouldn't because I pre-check all of my condoms before I apply them to my harpoon. - You're so weird. - That's judgemental. And, if we're gonna use labels, which you know I disapprove of, I'd say that you're awesome. Let's be honest, okay, I don't believe in marriage. - You don't believe in marriage? I mean, my Dad, who's a very close relative, he told me, "Don't ya ever get married," and then my uncle joined in and... I don't want to talk about that. I'm a very sexual being, is what I'm trying to say. Oh, you're a very sexual being? We haven't had sex in weeks. - I've grown bored of you sexually. Oh, it feels good to say that. - You're bored of me? - No, no! No, I'm not bored of you. It just, it's just that I'm bored of making love to you, but we could fix it. Oh, believe me, we could fix it. I've got this friend named Jamie who is more than willing to join us in the bedroom for a menage and it'll spice things up. - You want me to have a threesome with some strange woman? It's not a woman and we don't have to do it, but we do have to put the program back on. - I obviously have a lot to think about. - Was this a fight? It was a fight. - Oh, Mary. - Oh, Dave. - I like you. - Oh. - Hold on, I'm sorry, - Seriously? - I'm sorry, it's just Peter. He keeps calling. - Hmm, how is Peter? - It's all right, I mean, he puts on a brave face, but you can tell it's killing him. How's Nancy? - Same, I can't believe they haven't gotten back together yet. - I know, but what can you do? - Is Peter coming to the cabin next month? Not if Nancy's coming. - What if she wasn't coming? - She is. - But, what if Peter thought she wasn't coming? - Wait. So, your friends were trying to trick you and your wife into spending more time together? - Well, sure, when you say it like that, it sounds insane. - I don't know. I really think I should just stay home this year. - But, you said you were coming this weekend. - I know, it's just that, with everything that's happened-- - Don't stay home, that's the worst thing you can do. Dave wants all of us to be there this weekend. I want you to be there. - We go every year. - I know, but it's not every year my wife leaves me. - I thought it was just a trial separation. It is. The trial's not going great. - Peter will be there and I haven't seen Peter in months. - Peter's not coming. - Nancy's not coming. - Why? Is it because she thinks I'm gonna be there? Because you can tell her I'm not gonna be there, you should tell her I'm not gonna be there. Why not? - Uh, I don't know, Dave said he had plans. So, if he's the only reason you're not coming, please come, please. - No, it's nothing to do with you, she's got plans. It's gonna be me and Mary, George and Susie. - Susie? - Yeah, me and Mary, George and Susie. - Well, it might be nice to get out of the city. - Okay, sure, I guess. I might be a little late getting there, though. - Great, you're not gonna regret this. We're gonna have a great time. - I'll tell Mary; she'll be thrilled. - You're absolutely sure Peter's not going to be there? - Definitely not. - And, Dave, you're, you're sure Nancy's not gonna be there? - I'm absolutely positive. - Okay, see you then, bye. - Who'd Peter have plans with? - Is Peter coming? - Yep, isn't she? - Yep, he'll thank us for this. He will, they both will. - So, it was all set. Nancy and I were both coming to the cabin and Susie had gotten back together with George after their fight. - Yep, all right then. I'll see you soon, bye. - Who was that? - That's Dave. Dave said Peter's in. - Peter's coming? - Mm-hmm. - But, I thought he wasn't gonna come because Nancy's gonna be there. - Nope, Dave said it's all good. - Why don't we go away alone together this weekend, just the two of us, what do you think? - What's gotten into you? - No, I'm, nothing, I mean, I just want to be alone with my big man. - Hmm, well, I haven't seen Peter in, like, a year, so, let's just stick to the original plan and we'll do that Bermuda trip you were talking about, swim with the dolphins. Okay? - Great. - I love you. - Fuck. You coming, Honey? - Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. Hey, Mom. Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna ask her this weekend. Yeah, we're heading out to the cabin in a little bit. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, no. No, she has no idea and I'd like to keep it that way, okay? All right, I love you too. I'll see you when I get back. - Got everything? Hey, yeah, you scared me. - Sorry, who was that on the phone? - Um, Steve, from work. Yeah, I had to tell him where the paperwork was. - Oh, that's it? - Yeah. You ready to go? - Sure. - All right. - Yoo hoo! Peter. - Hey, George! Susie, it is so good to-- No need. - Ah, hooch. What'd you do, stud? - What, nothing, why? What did she say I did? I didn't do anything. - Just messing with you. She's been acting like a real B-word, all day. I think she has her period. - Oh. She's bleeding from the-- - Oh, no, I get it, yeah. - Vagina. - Here you go. - I think I need a straw. - Hey, fellas. - Ooh, hey. - I can't wait for this weekend. It's going to be an amazing time. - Yep, great time. - I can feel it. - Yep, um, I'm starving, so I'm, I think I'm gonna go in the kitchen and see if there's anything to eat, okay? So, that's what I'm gonna do, just go into the kitchen. - He has no idea that Nancy's coming, does he? - Nah, but they'll thank us, they both will. - What could go wrong? Rachel, I love you. - Where's the suitcase? - Huh? - Our fucking rolly bag. - Oh, right, it's on the, the first room on the left. - That's Dave and Mary's room. Could you go and get it and put it in our room? - I'm watching Friends. Uh, during the commercial, okay? - Forget it, I'll go do it. I wouldn't want you to miss Mr. Chandler. - You're the best. - Fuck you. - Huh? - Love you. - Oh, I love you, too. - He wanted the rolly bag so he can roll it, but I'm the one who's always carrying it. - Hey, Susie, can I help you with that bag? - No, thanks, I've got it. - Susie, we need to talk about what happened. Just ignoring it isn't-- - Nope, can't, I'm unpacking now. - Ignoring it isn't healthy, but sure, later. - All right, later then. - Mary, have you seen our bag? - Uh, last I saw, it was on the floor, but the side of the bed. - No, I put it on the bed. - See, side of the bed. No! I mean, I don't want you to do that, I'll do that. I, I want you to relax this weekend. Do you want to go for a walk? - Sure. - Okay. Bring your silly hat. - Ooh, good idea! Hmm. - George, George! George, George. What's going on, man? - Steve. - Yeah. What's up, man? - Nothing much, man. I'm here to party, man. - Oh, no, no, no. It's a, it's a couples thing. - A couples thing? - Yeah, how about next year, we lock it up for the boys, okay? - Hey, you think you can give me a ride back to the ferry? It's two miles away, I just walked and the last ferry leaves in 15 minutes. - No, I gotta go, the finish line. Gotta get, gotta get to finish line. - Are you-- - I really wanna-- Finish line! - Uh, I'm gonna go start dinner. - Oh, okay. - That's a lovely hat she has. - Is Peter here? - Uh, no, I think he's outside. - Can I talk to you about something personal? - Sure, what's going on? - It's about Peter. - All right, spill. What's going on with you two? - Nothing, why, what did he say? - He didn't say anything, but, for starters, you're avoiding Peter like he has the plague. I thought you and Peter were friends. - We are. - What? - Something happened. Dave, what are you doing? - Hey, Peter, how are you? - Um, look, I need to ask you something and what I need to ask you might be vitally important to my future happiness, so I need your advice. - Oh, if it's vitally important to your future happiness, how can I refuse? - Cool, cool, cool, cool. You can't tell anyone. You can't tell Mary. You certainly can't tell George. - Okay, Peter, what's going on? - Well, you know how I had a crush on Susie before her and George started dating? - I think everybody but Susie knew that. - Yeah, well, something happened. - What happened? - A couple of weeks ago, me and George got into a really bad fight. - What did you fight over? - Well, we've been together for four fucking years, that's two Summer Olympics, a girl has expectations. - Well, sure. - Look, this is the wedding album my mother gave me when I was little and that's all I've ever wanted. I take it everywhere I go. A fairytale wedding with ice sculptures and a horse-drawn carriage-- - A castle? - Yeah. - That's an actual castle? - No, it's the Berlin Wall. Mary, that's not the point. It doesn't even matter because George doesn't even want to get married. Oh. In fact, he doesn't believe in marriage at all. Anyway, he said some shit, I said some shit. - I'm so sorry. Is everything all right? - It is, now, but at the time, it didn't seem like it was gonna be, so I left. - What do you mean, you left? - I left the house and I went to a bar. - So, when Nancy left me, I didn't take it very well. In fact, most nights, I went to a bar to get drunk. - Yeah, I know, I was with you. - Yeah, but not that night. I was already pretty drunk when she walked in. Who? Peter was there, looking miserable as always, nursing his drink and him and Nancy had been separated for a couple of months. - So, she sits down next to me, so I buy her a drink and we start talking and it's like I can tell her anything and she can tell me anything. So, she tells me about this huge fight her and George had and she doesn't know what to do. She was a mess. - So, I'm telling him things that I've never told anyone before and we're both just buying each other drinks and we got pretty drunk. And, we're standing outside and I tell her, I don't want to be alone tonight and then she tells me she doesn't want to be alone. And then, we sort of kissed. - Whoa, whoa, you sort of kissed? You can't sort of kiss; you either kiss or you don't kiss. What happened? - You kissed him? - Yeah. - Then what happened? No, you know what, don't tell me. I don't want to know. - Okay. - Who kissed who? - I thought you didn't want to know. - I don't, but I'm in too deep, just spill. - She kissed me first, but then, I was kissing her and then we were both sort of kissing each other and then I invited her back to my apartment. - You went to his apartment? - It seemed like a good idea at the time. - You slept with Peter? Well, there wasn't much sleeping going on, if you know what I mean. I don't want to know what you mean. - I'm talking about sex, Dave, lots of sex. It was great! It was awful, I felt terrible. - Oh, I felt great the next day. It was like Nancy leaving me wasn't the end of my life, but just the beginning, you know? - What about George? - George? Oh, we weren't thinking much about George at the time. - Does George know? - No, and you can't tell him. - How could you do that with Peter? He's George's friend. - George is our friend! - Yes, yes he is, but he's always been more your friend than mine. We all sort of just hung out together. - But, you like George. - I do. I like him a lot, but I always liked Susie more. - Oh, what about Nancy? - Nancy, Nancy doesn't want me. Nancy doesn't even talk to me anymore. - Peter-- - I know. I know, but it just, that night with Susie, it was like all those old feelings just came back. - Do you have feelings for Peter? - No, were you even listening? I had enough to drink to sink the Titanic, but that's not the problem. - Then, what's the problem? - I think the sick fuck might be in love with me. - Anyway, I think Susie's in love with me. And, anyway, George only beat me to asking her out by, like, five minutes. - I know, I just can't believe you slept with Susie. - Well, we were both pretty drunk. - Would you take this seriously? - I am, I'm taking it very seriously. I'm gonna get Susie to dump George and go out with me. - No, not this weekend! - Why, what's so special about this weekend? - I'm gonna ask Mary to marry me. - Aw, you're gonna ask Mary to marry you? That's why you wanted us all to be here this weekend? Okay, I'll do my best. I won't even talk to Susie this weekend. - I would appreciate it. Just keep it in your pants for 48 hours. - Listen, you have to talk to him this weekend. You have to leave him with no hope of this going anywhere. - I know. - Tonight! It's not fair to Peter or Nancy if he thinks there's some future with you two. - You're right. I'll tell him tonight. - I'll avoid her like the plague, I promise, for you, buddy. - Thank you. - Peter, we need to talk. - I tried my best. - Hey, guys, look at who I found. - Hey, everybody, am I late? - Holy shit! What is she doing here? - What am I doing here? What are you doing here? Mary said you weren't coming to the cabin this weekend. - Well, Dave told me you weren't coming. If I thought you'd be here, I would never have come. - Now, everybody, just calm down. Mary and I thought that it would be best for you guys to come here and talk things out. - Ha, talk it out? Not exactly Peter's strong suit. - Oh, I talked, I talked. I thought we were doing better. I thought we were making progress. I even went to see that stupid doctor of yours. - Dr. Gordon is not stupid. - Dr. Gordon's a moron. - You think I'm a moron. I, I never said that. - You just said it. - Oh, well, um, anyway. - Guys-- - Mary, how would you think this would work? I can understand and idiot move like this coming from Dave. - Hey! - An idiotic, but well-intentioned, move, better? - Little bit. - Mary, I told you things about me and Peter. You must have known this wouldn't work. - I'm beginning to see that. You two are our best friends. - Hey! - Two, of our best friends. You loved each other so much. We just wanted to help. We thought if we just got you both in the same room together, maybe, I don't know. - Well, Peter, - Nancy. - Do you want to go or should I? - I'll go, you stay. - No, you got here first, I'll go. - Well, if you insist. Take the roads carefully. It gets a little dangerous at night, okay? - Peter! - What? She wants to go. - Nobody's going anywhere. The last ferry's gone with the wind, 1939. - Um, I can, uh, swim across the lake and then once I get to the highway, I can hitchhike to a hotel, I guess. - Look, we were married for years. I think we can spend one weekend together in the same house without killing each other. - Can we? - Great. Who's hungry? - This dinner is excellent, Mary. I haven't had a home-cooked meal in I don't know how long. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, I'm just complimenting Mary's cooking. It's been a while since anyone cooked for me. The fact that I was kicked out of my house and had to live in a hotel for a month, I'm sure, has nothing to do with it. - I suppose that's my fault? - Well, I didn't kick myself out of the house. - George, Susie was saying that you guys are thinking about going to Bermuda. - We're thinking about it, thinking hard. Well, that's great. And, the chicken is really good. It's really good. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Eh. - It's nice to get away. - It is. - Yep. - God, you know, I think the last time I went on vacation was my honeymoon. - I took you on other vacations. - Yes, our summer getaway to Hoboken was so nice. - You seemed to like it at the time. I'm sorry, it's just funny, I mean, six friends, stranded in a cabin. I mean, if this was a horror movie, we'd all be dead by morning. - All right, that's it. When are you two gonna get back together? Everyone's thinking it. - Susie, that's wildly inappropriate. - You know, I'm gonna go lie down. It was a long car ride. - Yeah. - Sure. I'll show you your room. I'm sorry about all that. We really did want to help. - I know, I know. What was that? - Oh my God, it was so awkward. That was the worst dinner ever. - Oh! - So. - So? - It's important you know how uncomfortable that was for me. - Mm-mm, it was pretty uncomfortable for everybody. - I have to know, what exactly did you think was gonna happen, tonight? Was I supposed to see Nancy and she would see me and then, suddenly, we'd be all over each other? No. You were supposed to see her and then talk to her and then you'd be all over each other. - Nancy doesn't love me anymore. She said, I'm not the man she married, whatever the hell that means, and one weekend was never gonna change that and you should have known that, especially with what I told you this morning. - Like, I'm supposed to cook for him? - Gimme my chicken. Iron my socks. He doesn't talk like that at all. - That's gonna win me over. - I don't know what that was. Uh, whew, I mean, we wanted to try. If it weren't for you guys we wouldn't be together, so-- - I know, I appreciate it. - I think, I think Dave's cheating on me. - What? - No, it's nothing, I'm, I'm being crazy. - Why do you think he's cheating on you? - I don't know, he's been really distant and secretive. He was on the phone and he was talking about me and, uh, he lied about it. And then, he wouldn't let me open his bag. - I don't know, I mean, that's weird. It's weird, but I don't think that means he's cheating. - Yeah, I know, I'm being crazy. - Dave would never cheat on you. Dave loves you. - Well, he might love me a little more after tonight 'cause I'm planning to seduce him. Okay, I'll let you rest. I gotta go get ready. - Oh, wow. Damn. - Oh my God, George. Yes! - Yes, to what? - Yes, to whatever you want to ask me this weekend. - Whatever? - Mm-hmm. Oh, how about that? How about this, yeah? - Is there anything you wanna ask me, right now? - Mm, I can't think of anything right now, but later on, when we're, I have an idea, so you can say yes to that. Just keep an open mind. - All right. - Okay. - Later, then. - Later. I don't know what's gotten into you, but I like it. - George, - Dolphin? - I think that you should help Nancy and Peter get back together. Help them find that spark that we have, that they don't have, that we have. - Right. - Right. - How do I do it? Do whatever it takes. Oh, anything goes? - Anything goes. - Could you hit me again? - No, that's weird. And it's, not that weird. - Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Look, dinner was pretty awful. - It wasn't that bad. - It was pretty bad. - Okay, it was bad. - I don't want things to be weird with us this whole weekend, I mean, we're stuck here, right? So, we could at least try to be civil with each other. - I couldn't agree more. - Good, can you believe Dave and Mary thought this was a good idea? - They were just trying to help; plus, maybe it couldn't hurt to talk. - Maybe. Hello? - Hey, it's just me. Why are you in the closet? I'll be out in a minute, Honey. I've got a surprise for you. - Oh, I love surprises. Honey, I gotta go outside, now. I will be back. Peter, I need your help! - What? - I lost the ring. - Whoa! - You can't tell Mary. - Mary! - Peter! Peter, what are you doing here? - I'm, I'm helping? - Dave, get him out of here. - Uh, breasts, nice to see you, Mary. You look great! Ow, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What is wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? You almost pulled my ear off and she does look great. Now, what ring did you lose? - The engagement ring. - How do you lose an engagement ring? - I don't know; it was in the top pocket of my luggage and now it's gone. I need you to go to the living room and look for it and I need to go back in there. - Okay, okay. - Go, I need it. - I'll find it. - Now, go, go! You can count on me. Look, excuse me. - Are you looking for something, Peter? - Um, yes, have you seen a small shaped box? - Sit, just sit. We were on a break! - Good. This is nice. How you doing? - How long has it been since we've all been here together, like a year? - Yeah, I guess, a year. - What happened to you two? Everything was so perfect. You loved each other. - George, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but-- - Shh, Nancy, I know you two were happy, what happened? - I was; we were happy. I was very happy. And then, I wasn't. - You never told me why. Was I just supposed to guess? - Peter, I... One day, the spark was just gone. - Ooh, ouch. - You know, Nancy, sometimes in a long-term relationship, the spark just fizzles out. But, I think I could help. - How are you gonna help us with that? - Peter, ae you familiar with the menage? - A threesome? You want me and Nancy to have a threesome? - Just watch, Peter. I guess that's why we're all friends. - No, nope, no it's not gonna happen. Nancy, it's not gonna happen, right? Nancy! George, stop kissing Nancy! Upf, oh! It's, it's been a while. Um, I, I gotta go lay down. Um, headache. - Well, I tried. Tell Susie I tried. - Wait, wait, wait, Susie asked you to do that? - Oh, she wanted me to get you kids talking. That was my idea. She said anything goes. Speaking of Susie, though-- - What about Susie? - She's been acting strange lately. - Strange, how strange? - I don't know, she won't tell me. She's outside, now. Do you, you think you could go talk to her for me? - You want me to go outside and talk to Susie, alone, right now? - It would mean a lot. - Okay, I'll do it. - Oh, you are such a good person. Oh, thank you. - Oh, tell Susie I tried, okay? I will. - And, um, let me know what she says and if you change your mind about anything, - Okay. - I'm right here. - Okay, okay. Oh, I am going to hell. * I'm getting married at Buon Assista - Peter, I was just about to go-- - Susie, Susie, you were the one who said we needed to talk, so let's talk. Just give me two minutes and that's it, okay? - Okay, let's talk. What happened that night was a mistake. - Aw, don't say that. That night was amazing. - Eh, it, it was nice, but-- - Susie, I love, the way you have your hair. Is it raining? No rain, I'll be. You guys need anything, any drinks? - Nope. - Good, we're good. - Good. - Drinks. - What was that about? - George wants me to find out what's wrong with you. - Peter! - I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm awful human being. Look, if you can tell me that things with, between you and George are better, now, than they were that night, then I'll leave you alone. I'll never bother you again, I promise. - I love George. I know that's not what you want to hear, right now, but it's true. - But, can George give you-- puppy dogs? - I know liars when I see liars. You two are thirsty. Puppy dogs? - It's the first thing that came to my mind. It's nice to see you laugh. So, what about us? - Peter, I like you. If me and George weren't together, maybe, probably not, but things have changed. I didn't think they could, but they have. - So, that's a maybe? - No. - Oh, okay. - Peter-- - No, no, yeah. - I, I'm sorry. No, I'm really not sorry. - Well? - I tried my best. - The heck is wrong with everyone this weekend? - Dave, did you find your toothbrush yet? - Not yet. - You can just use mine and we can get you a new one in the morning. - Gross, I like to use my own. - Dave! - Yes, dear. - When your girlfriend, who is wearing some very sexy lingerie that she bought especially for this trip is telling you to come to bed, the correct response is, "Right away." So, I'll ask you again, are you coming to bed? - Right away! - What are you doing? - Foreplay? - Ooh, you're so distracted tonight. I guess I'll have to do something to get your mind off whatever's distracting you. - I can't stop thinking about you. I tried, but I can't. I've been in love with you for years and if you feel the same way about me that I feel about you, meet me in the patio after everyone's asleep, at one o'clock. Love always, Peter. - Well, I guess that's a hard no. - Peter? - Susie? Nancy. - Oh my God, did you do all this for me? - Of course I did, uh, who else would I do it for? Have a seat. - Chocolate covered strawberries? I didn't think you remembered. - Of course, I remembered. What I'm really wondering is if you remembered. - I don't think I've had these since our honeymoon. - Our honeymoon, how could I forget that? - This is so unlike you. It's so romantic and spontaneous. - I'm romantic. - No, you're not. That was part of the problem. - Well, better late than never. - Wait, what were you doing, just sitting here? What were you waiting for? - Um, I was waiting, I was waiting for the courage, the courage to come get you. I didn't, I didn't know if you'd like all this, or me, anymore. - Peter, of course I still like you. I just feel like we've been strangers living in the same house for years, you know? - Of course, I know. How do you think I felt? - I had no idea you felt that way. - It'd be a shame to let this wine go to waste. Would you like a glass? - Sure, why not? Just one, though. - Oh, just one. To unexpected surprises. - To unexpected surprises. - Hey, Dolphin. Well? - Well? - Well, we're alone, now. Don't you have something to ask me? - Oh, really? Okay, - Okay. - I will, oh, will you, Susie the Dolphin Smith-- - Yes, yes, yes! Hey, hey, hey! I didn't even ask you the question. Okay. - Will you, Susie Smith, love of my life, get it on, with me? - What? Oh, I know. - You do? - Mm-hmm. - If you know, could you tell me? - Did you lose something? - No, the anal beads are in the bag, babe. This is a ring. - I know. I found it in your bag. I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry, George, but yes, I'll marry you. Of course, I will marry you. - That's not my ring. - What? - This is not my ring. - It was in your bag. - That's not my bag. That must be Peter or Dave's bag, which is actually hilarious because they're gonna be in for a huge surprise when they find all that weird crap in there. - Oh my God. - Oh my God is right, you could say that again. Give me a hug. - You sick fuck. You are never gonna ask me to marry you. - You know I don't believe in marriage, babe. We talked about this. You don't? - I don't! I really don't. We talked, I talked, you yelled. And, then, we got into another fight. I mean, think about Peter and Nancy, right. They were really, really happy and then this thing gets involved and now they're miserable. - They're separated. - Right, and I don't want us to get separated because we love each other, so. - I think I'm gonna stay in one of the empty rooms tonight. - How about hugs instead? - No. You're disgusting. You're disgusting. Peter? I know I'm late, but, I hope I'm not too late. - There she is. I haven't seen you laugh in a very long time. - Well, you haven't said anything funny in a very long time. I don't know if it's the wine talking, but you are looking very sexy. - It's the wine. Trust me, it's the wine. Do you remember the first time we came up here, - Yes. - We were walking by the lake and George-- - George wanted to go skinny-dipping. - He always wanted to go skinny-dipping. - You know, we had some good times up here. - Yeah, we did. - I don't think I've been up this late in years. - Ah, as I recall, most of those nights were also with me and a bottle of wine and I also recall how most of those nights ended. - Peter, are you asking me to spend the night? I think I am. - What kind of girl do you think I am? I'm hoping the kind that sleeps with a guy on the first date. - Is that what this is, our first date? - I'm hoping the first of many. Where are you going? - I'm, I'm just gonna go get a drink. I'll be back. - But, I'm so sleepy. - Shh, shh. - Shh. - Okay, okay, I will go slip into something more comfortable. You go warm up the sheets for me, okay? - Yes, ma'am. Whoa! - Peter, we need to talk. - Oh, yes, yes, you're right. Um, look, I'm sorry I saw you in your lingerie and stared, but, to be fair, you're very attractive and I'm just-- - What? No, this has nothing to do with you; this is about Dave. Are you drunk? - What? Yes, a little. Dave, what about Dave? - He's been acting weird all night and there were some things in his bag that were disturbing. - You found the case? - What case? - Nevermind. - Fine. I think he's hiding something from me. He went to get a drink and he hasn't come back. You're his best friend, do you know what happened? - What? Yes, no, um, uh, no, I'm sure he's fine. Uh, look, why don't you just go back into your room and wait for him. I'm sure he'll be back in a few minutes. - Okay, yeah. Yeah. Shit! - Mare Elizabeth McConnell, just go back to bed. He'll be back any minute. Shit! Dave? Dave, where are you? If you're cheating on me, I swear to God... - Peter. - Susie. What are you doing here? - I changed my mind. I read your letter. It was beautiful. You were right, George is never gonna give me what I want. Well, what about you? - Oh, this is spectacularly bad timing. - Why are you running from me? - I'm not running. Oh, I get it, you're playing hard to get. - No, no, no, no, no, you said you loved George and that this could never happen again, right? - Oh, George and I have been together for four years. He's never gonna ask me to marry him. Let's forget about George. Who's George? - Peter, you didn't? - Well, I, the thing is, I was, I just, yeah. Yes, I did. Okay. - I know what you're thinking, but I'm not the bad guy here. - Okay. - I mean, I didn't mean to hurt anyone; I didn't. - Okay. - Ooh, shit! Fuck, shit! - Who's that? - Um, probably Nancy. - Nancy, what's she doing here? - Um, I, I invited her. You invited her? Oh, did George tell you about that threesome thing? It never happened. - What, no, no, no, no, no! I had wine and strawberries and candles for you. - Oh that's so sweet. Peter. - Yeah. But then, you know, you didn't show up and then Nancy was there. We had a few drinks and one thing led to another and I invited her back here. You can't be here. You can't be here. Nancy can't see you. - I'm not gonna hide! - I just need you to wait in the bathroom for a couple minutes. - Fine, get rid of her, fast. - I will. - Come in! George. - We need to talk, Peter. George, what are you doing here? - I read the letter. - Oh God, you read the letter. Look, George, I swear to God I never meant for you to read that letter. - Sit. - Now, George, come on. - Sit! - Now, George, you have to believe me, I never meant you to see that letter. - I'm glad I read it. - You're, you're glad you read it? - Yeah, I mean, honestly, I thought it was strange, at first, but then it all started to make sense. You know, like? - I can't believe you're cool with this? - Of course, I'm cool with this, you know? I mean, we're friends. - Yeah, I never realized we were that close. George! What are you doing? You're gay? - Peter, I hate labels. Let's just say I'm curious. After all, you're the one that said you're in love with me for years. - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. George, this is a huge mistake. - The only mistake would be keeping your clothes on, Peter. Peter, I'm here; open up. - Nancy! - What's Nancy doing? - I invited her. Uh, you have to hide. - No more hiding, ever again. You invite her in, we can all make love together. - Um, I don't think Nancy's ready for that. I need you to hide. - Okay, I'll hide in the bathroom. - Yes, yes, the bathroom. Go in the bathroom. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! You can't go in the bathroom. Why not? - Because it's a mess and you don't like messes. - Oh. - Hide under the bed. Peter, I'm cold. * Just one moment - Okay, make it quick. Or, don't. - Nancy, you look amazing. - Aren't you going to invite me in? I think I'm coming down with a cough. We might want to wait until it goes away. - I think I'll take my chances. - Oh, I am so much trouble. - Peter. - George, what are you doing here? Where's your shirt? George, what are you doing here? - No more lies, Peter. Nancy, Peter's in love with me, has been for years. Him and I are gonna get funky on this bed, M-kay. If you want to join us, you're more than welcome. - Um, there really is a very good explanation for all of this. - What's Nancy doing in your bed? I thought you were gonna get rid of her. George, put your shirt on. No one wants to see your lopsided nipples. - Why am I here? Why are you in my husband's bathroom in your underwear? - I, I can explain this. There was, um-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Peter, after the beautiful letter that you wrote me, there shouldn't be any more secrets. - The letter was for me, you moron. - What letter? It was for me. Peter, tell the Dolphin. - Oh my God, it was all for her, all of it, though, the wine and the strawberries. - Nancy, I-- - Oh my God. Peter, don't. - Nancy. - There's nothing wrong with my nipples. - You were gonna sleep with your wife while I was in the bathroom? - What, uh, yes, no, I, I don't know. I'm pretty drunk, right now. - Did you mean anything you said? - Yes, I meant everything I said. That, that night with you was the happiest I've been in a long time. - Then, why was Nancy in your bed? - I don't know, she, she was my wife. She is my wife. But, then George came and kissed me and it was all very confusing. - Mm-hmm. So, not only do you not love me, but you're sleeping with my girlfriend. - I'm gonna kill you. Nancy? Are you okay? - Now, George, don't do anything stupid. - Let's think about this. You obviously have some very strong feelings towards me. I think we should all just sit down and talk about it and relax a little before we do anything rash. - I don't want to kill you, so you should run. - What? Run, now. - George, George, let's talk about this! - Oh, there's nothing to talk about. - I knew it! How could you, Dave? - George, let's talk. - That's my best friend. - It's not what it looks like! What is it you want? - What the fuck is going on? - Oh, I'm so sorry, Dave. That was meant for Peter. He harpooned my Dolphin. - Again? - Again! You knew about this? - Oh, don't act so outraged. You were about to have sex with Peter. - George, you're gay? - I'm omni-sexual! I don't believe in terms and labels when it comes to love and lovemaking and I told you that! - I thought you were joking! - What bullshit! - It's not bullshit. You can Google it and, another thing, you're a cheater. It was you that went in his room in your unmentionables. - I asked you for one thing this weekend, for one thing, for you to keep it in your pants and you couldn't even do that! What the fuck is wrong with you? - So many things. - Leave him alone, you hypocrite! - Mary, you don't understand. - I understand perfectly. You were sleeping with Nancy! - You were sleeping with my wife? - Oh fuck! - Can I ask which one of you geniuses brought the engagement ring? - You found the ring! - Oh, it was yours? - Oh, Peter, you were gonna ask me to marry you? - You were gonna ask her to marry you? - Nope, not my ring. - Great, so no one wants to marry me. - Whose ring is it, Loverboy? - I can't say. - You can't say? Kiss me, right now. - I don't care about the fricking ring; I just want to know why you were sleeping with my best friend! Nancy, how could you? - What do you mean who was it? - What are you talking about? Will everyone shut up? - George, let go of Peter. You're not gonna kill him. You really, really should, but you're not gonna, so let him go. And, Mary, I would never cheat on you. I love you so much. The ring is mine. I brought you here this weekend because I wanted to ask you to be my wife. - Oh my God. Dave, I had no idea. I saw you with Nancy and then there were mysterious phone conversations and sex toys in the luggage. - Sex toys? It doesn't matter. Mary Elizabeth McConnell, I have loved you from the very first moment that I met you. Will you marry me? - Yes! Yes, of course, I'll marry you. - Let's get you cleaned up. - Nancy, I never meant-- - You can go to hell. - Fair enough. Well, that could have all gone better. - I don't even know what to say. I have to go. - Susie, I just want to let you know that I don't blame you for anything that happened this weekend and, more importantly, I forgive you. - No, you don't forgive me. George, you just tried to sleep with Peter. Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry, I can't talk to you right now. - George, I just want to say I'm, I'm flattered that-- - Don't speak, I know just what you're saying, so please stop explaining. Don't tell me 'cause it hurts, No Doubt. * Tired of the seas * Boat comes ashore * Needing a breather * He comes up for more * Than he ever could before * She was gone * Do ooh ooh ooh ooh * Into the streets * He twiddles his hands * Since then uneasy * Tries to make friends * But it ain't like it used to be * Not before he set out to see * What have we become * Since she's gone * Do do do do * Ooh do woo hoo hoo * Walks to the hillside * Gear on his back - Trying to sneak out before anybody wakes up? - I thought it was for the best, considering. - Considering what? - You know, everyone hating me. - Everybody doesn't hate you. I don't hate you. - How's Mary? - She doesn't hate you, either, well, much. - Well, that's something. Oh, Geez, I'm sorry I punched you. - It's okay. If I thought you slept with Mary, I would do the same thing. - I would never sleep with Peter. - Oh, not your weekend, there. Kisses. - No, it is not. Thank you, Mary, that means a lot. Still, I'm sorry for everything. Congratulations, by the way. You two make a lovely couple. I'm looking forward to the wedding. I have a feeling I won't be that popular with the wedding party, so I hope you can find me a seat. - Oh, you're not going near the wedding party. We'll put you in the kitchen. - As I deserve. Tell George and Susie I'm sorry for everything. I really screwed everything up, didn't I, and Nancy? - You should probably talk to them yourself. - Maybe, yeah. - Oh, dammit! - Car trouble? - The car won't start and the earliest the tow company can come is on Monday. Perfect weekend. - Let me give you a ride back to the city. - No. - Unless you want to stay here all weekend. - Fine. I was trying to leave before anybody woke up. - Me, too, except Dave was already up. - Oh. - Can you believe he asked Mary to marry him? - It's nice. - It is. Nancy, I just want to say I-- - Peter, not now. - Okay. - So, what now? We go home. - I'll see you later. - You going to meet Peter? - Yeah, me and George are going to take him out to lunch. You want to go with us? No. - All right, I'll tell him you said, "Hi." - Please don't. - Okay. Mary says, "Hi." - Really? That's nice, I thought she hated me. - No. - So, is George coming? - He said he is. - I haven't seen him since the cabin. He did send me a very nice birthday card, which was nice. - Did you talk to Nancy? I did. - How'd that go? - Not well. I'm so glad you came, Nancy. - I thought we should talk. - I couldn't agree more. Look, I am so sorry about everything that happened at the cabin. I don't know what was going through my mind. Look, I brought you flowers. - Peter, stop. I'm seeing somebody. - You're seeing someone? - His name is Frank and I don't know if it's going somewhere, but I want to find out. - Frank? - He's, nothing like you which is what I need, right now. - That's hurtful. - Goodbye, Peter. - Nan... Goodbye, Nancy. - I'm sorry, buddy. - Yeah, me too. But, you know, it's okay. We tried to make things work, we tried to fix things and we couldn't, so it's all right. - That's a very positive, and completely unlike-you, way of looking at things. - Thank you, I'm working on personal growth with Dr. Gordon. - I thought Dr. Gordon was an idiot? - Oh, oh, he is, he is an idiot, but Nancy seemed to like him, so I'm gonna give him a chance. - Yeah, so are you seeing anybody? Mary wanted to know if you wanted to bring a plus one? - Yeah, yeah, I was seeing Susie. - You're seeing Susie? - Emphasis on the word was, about four months ago. It turns out we had nothing in common. She's with someone else, now. - Who? - A real prince. - Nice guy, huh? - No, no, he's an actual prince of a European country. Uh, she got the fairytale wedding she wanted. I think she's, like, third in the line for the throne. She sent me a Christmas card. - That's weird. - Yeah, yeah, it is. But, well, you know, when it's right, it's right, so I wish her all the happiness in the world. - And, how are you? - I'm great, thanks to my lover, Adam Rosenbaum, and you can tell Mary that I'll be a plus one, a gay one. - You could just say, plus one. - That's offensive. And, you, I am working on forgiving you for, harpooning my Dolphin, I'm working on it. - Thank you? - So, are you bringing anybody? - Well, I was going to bring this girl I was seeing, Jane, but she doesn't want to see me anymore. She said I lacked maturity. She's 19, but I lack maturity. - 19 is young. - Who's she gonna take to the prom, now? - At least, you got your job. - Actually, I do not. Apparently, they frown on you not coming in for two weeks. - Jobs do that. - Mm-hmm. - You still have the apartment? - Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that, you and Mary, I'm just gonna need a place to stay for a couple of weeks, just until I get my, back up on my feet. - I would love to, but the dog and you're allergic, so-- - I'm not allergic to dogs. - But, Mary does not like you. - You could stay with Adam and I. - I could sleep on the couch. - Actually, he's on business. You could stay in bed with me. - Nah. - Remember when we kissed? - Yes, I do. - I do. I still love you. - You guys kissed? Let's show him? - So, that was it. I'd hit rock bottom: no wife, no girlfriend, no job, practically homeless. Nancy filed for divorce. So, it was at that moment, when I was at my lowest, that I decided I needed to turn my life around. I got a new apartment. It's bit of a fixer upper, but I'll make it work. Also, my old company hired me back. Funny enough, it's Susie's old job. Hello? It's an entry-level position. Oh, hi, Joseph. But, I'm told there's room for advancement. Yep, uh huh. - So, things are going well, now? - Yeah, pretty well. Dave and Mary got married. It was a lovely ceremony. Mary had me sitting in the back, by the kitchen. I thought she was joking about that; she was not. - I see. - And, Nancy got Dave and Mary in the divorce, of course, so I can only see Dave every other weekend. I'm kidding, mostly. - Well, you've certainly been through a lot, Peter, but like I always say, it's the journey and not the destination that's important. So, have you learned anything from your journey? - Absolutely. - That's good, Peter. What have you learned? - I'm in love with Nancy and I'm gonna get her back. - What? - Oh, Frank asked Nancy to marry her. - Ah, I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm going to the wedding. - Were you invited to the wedding? - I'm gonna go to the wedding and get Nancy to dump Frank and get back together with me. - That's very funny, Peter. You are joking, right? Right, Peter? Peter? * And that's where I got started * I'm headed back home * Boots in the garden * Boots in the garden * Oh, boots in the garden * Boots in the garden * Boots in the garden * Boots in the garden * Oh, boots in the garden * Boots in the garden * Oh, yeah, oh, oh * Boots in the garden * Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh * Ooh ooh hoo hoo
