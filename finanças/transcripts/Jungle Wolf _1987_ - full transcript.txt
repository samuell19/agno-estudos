(heroic music) - [Parrish] They trained me for the Vietnam War. To fight for my country, to survive in the jungle. Now it's peace-time and I'm home, but I know the jungle is waiting. (apprehensive music) (loud boom) (man screaming) (military drumming) (drumming tempo increases) (drumming stops) (apprehensive music) There's a city in Central America that borders on a large jungle. Things are usually peaceful there. Until the animals. (military drumming) (apprehensive music) (speaking foreign language) (military drumming) (apprehensive music) - How many times did I tell you to get home, right now. You should be at home right now taking care of your mother. You should be at home on time. You're always getting us in trouble. Why can't you stay home and help our mother? - [Guard] Hey, senorita. Leave the poor boy alone. It's such a beautiful morning. (indistinct speech) (guards chuckling) (guards laughing) - I thank you if you mind your own business. (guards laughing) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) Move! (truck engine rumbling) (tense music) (truck engine roaring) - Captain, I've been looking over your security. I'm afraid you've seriously underestimated the danger here. I cannot allow the ambassador to be put in this kind of jeopardy. - Relax, Mr. Conover, we are all safe here. My men are scattered to secure the area. And besides the ambassador is traveling with two of your own agents and I assure you I've taken all the necessary precautions. (commanding music) (car engine rumbling) (apprehensive music) - Mr. Ambassador, right this way please. (tense music) - Oh, Senor Ambassador. Please, come in. (tense music rises) (music crescendos) - The president asked me to come here for several reasons. He wants me to observe and report to him the level of guerrilla activities in the countryside. Our government wants to know how much more aid is needed to encourage these rebels to come out of the jungle and negotiate. The cycle of misery and violence must be broken. (man shouting in foreign language) - Down on the ground. (gun firing) (tense music) (gun firing rapidly) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Move your ass, Conover. Let's get the man outta here. - Mr. Ambassador, a rebel attack.

I always watch your show. Come, I'll take good care of you. (tense music) My fellow countrymen, I bring best wishes to all. To all who struggle so desperately for freedom. Today, we have struck a blow, a blow that will be heard around the world. While General Villanueva and his bandits rob our country blind, our true leader, Zapien, who is now suffering in Hidalgo Prison. But no more. For today my friends, we have a prisoner of our own. In the name of the (indistinct), I demand the release Isidro Zapien. We will not negotiate. We do not bluff. Unless Zapien is released unharmed in 72 hours, (fist banging on table) in 72 hours, or else, US Ambassador Worthington, die. I will trade the American only for Zapien. (airplane rumbling) - [Zak] Hello, Dad? - [Parrish] Yeah, Zak, what is it? - [Zak] Dad, there's someone here to see you. He says it's important. - [Parrish] Okay, I'm just about finished here. I'll be there in a few minutes.

I believe you know the name. - I should, a lot of good men died because of him. - [Man] And his death could cost a lot more lives. President is at this very moment preparing to send in troops, if you don't get him out alive. (somber music) - Another Vietnam. Zak, I have to go away for a few days. I want you to stay with Jim while I'm gone. - Sure, Dad, if I can't go. - Not this time. - Dad? - [Parrish] Yeah, Zak? - I love you, Dad. - I love you too, Zak. I love you too. (somber music) (gentle, rhythmic guitar music) - There's Hidalgo Prison. Villanueva arrested Zapien three weeks ago, before the elections. We really don't know which condition he's in, except that Villanueva assures us he's alive. - What about the rebels? How do we know that Worthington is okay? - Let's just say that we know that he's alive. At least for a couple more days. Beyond that. (car engine rumbling) - [Parrish] The mission, simple: get Zapien out of prison and deliver him to Hernandez and his rebels in the jungle. After that take, Ambassador Worthington to a designated clearing and airlift both of us out of there. The prison break, simple, maybe, but nothing in the jungle, whether here or in Vietnam, ever goes as planned. (tense percussive music) Some of the general's men? Maybe Villanueva wants to make sure that we don't get ourselves lost.

It's probably a trick. We will wait until the hour. (Hernandez chuckling) (dramatic music) (military drumming) (tranquil music) - I just, I just want to thank you again. - Like I said, forget it.

I feel safer with you with us than after us. But still, something about you that scares me a little - Shhh, quiet. - What is it? - The animals, they're frightened. Someone's coming. Take Zapien and head toward the exchange point. I'll try to hold them off, lead them away, then catch up. - Why can't we go together?

Rescuing Ambassador Worthington from the rebels and tearing Hernandez apart with my bare hands. Maybe I can accomplish both at the same time. Maria tells me she has a cousin with a hidden arsenal. We'll see. - Paco? Paco! (Paco chuckling) Paco, Zapien is dead. No, that's Steve, he's a friend. Hernandez murdered Zapien.
