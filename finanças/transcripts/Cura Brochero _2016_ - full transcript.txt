We were listening to this beautiful song performed as a tribute to our beloved “Priest Brochero” and we will soon be celebrating his beatification. In the town named after him, Villa Cura Brochero. Come in! Excuse me Hi Charly, how are you doing? Well! Why are you working so early? What's up? I just kept on going last night... I stayed here with Juan, he had to finish editing some material... what's that? It's a picture a plastic artist gave us... her name is Gladys Peralta It's really good! What are you going to do with it? I don't know yet... what have you got there? Ah, this is a newspaper clipping from Brochero's times. Listen: I'm all ears... “This man is just flesh and blood: He gives Mass, hears confession, helps people die with dignity, baptizes, celebrates marriage... And, however, he is an exception: he practices the Gospel You need a carpenter? He's a carpenter. You need a farmhand? He's a farmhand. He can tuck up his cassock anywhere, take a shovel or a hoe and make a public road in 15 days, helped by his parishioners... Look at that! Can you believe this priest? I got it Charly! This movie should be made the Brochero way... with people's participation and help, do you understand? And that picture will be the gift... You think so? “In the year of the lord, eighteen forty and on the 17th day of the month of March solemnly baptize José Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, one day old, legitimate son of Mr. Ignacio Brochero, and Mrs. Petrona Dávila, and his godparents Manuel Antonio Ceballos and Mrs. Josefa Dávila. I, as parish priest of the Santa Rosa de Río Primero parish, Hey, any idea about who will be starring in adult “Priest Brochero”? Here I have several likely candidates. But I know somebody who can play the leading role very well, he's a very good actor... but I don't know... Why are you not sure? Come in! As I was telling you, the guy is a little complicated, troublesome, I don't know, maybe he can get us in trouble... Thanks Mariana, bring Paula a coffee No, thanks, I really gotta go. Is he well-known? Not so much What's his name? Luciano... I don't remember his last name. I think his name is at the end of the list, I can call him if you want and we see what we can do... OK, call him Anyway, check everyone on the list. Great. Anyway, check everyone on the list. Great. I am Ignacio Brochero and this is my son José Gabriel. He's the fourth of seven children. We' are coming from Villa Santa Rosa de Río Primero. So, what can I do for you? Well, this son of mine has decided to study to become a priest. Our parish priest, Priest Villafañe, finds him actively involved in church; Well, listen. Here at the seminary, we have a minimum fee because this seminary is maintained only with the support of churchgoers. Well, Doctor, you know I'm going through hard times, we make a living working in the fields. Harvest times are sometimes good and sometimes bad... but again, if my son really feels God's calling, we are ready to make the effort and pay the fee. If this young man is sure he wants to stay, he can stay now because classes will be soon starting. Well son, your wish has been fulfilled. But you must study and make a great effort. Maybe you don't become a priest, but at least you will have enough tools for a better future and not be just a farmhand. Yes, Sir. I'm staying Ok, I'll leave you with the superintendent. As I was telling you Luciano, this is a movie and a documentary all together about Priest Brochero. Know him, don't you? No. Brochero, the Gaucho Priest! The one who rode his mule in the sierras... and helped that region make progress. And what? Am I supposed to star in a “priest”? Sure. But remember that Brochero was not just any priest. He was the priest of the people, of the town. He gave the serranos spiritual and material blessings. He built a school, roads. Got that? Yeah, yeah... it looks like he had a real entrepreneurial spirit. Yeah... but I'd say he was more than that. He was really concerned about people... he made it out of love. Where would the movie be shot? He made it out of love. Where would the movie be shot? There, in Villa Cura Brochero And how much is the pay? Well, we don't have that muchmoney for the movie, remember that this is all on our own. This is part of an evangelization project and for these things, you know, Come on! You're gonna tell me the Church doesn't have money? No, yeah, yeah, but don't take it that way... Look at Brochero for example. No, yeah, but don't take it that way... He had such an austere life that he was even called an air carnation because the guy seemed to live off nothing. I don't “live off nothing”! So, if the pay is not good, I'm not interested. Bye. A pleasure. Ok, thank you for coming. What are you doing!! You scared me to death! What are you peeking into? Gabriel left with Dean Clara to Las Playas What? They left to combat? No! Well, yes, but to administer the sacraments to those fallen in combat! They say it's already more than three hundred killed and that, only from Chacho Peñaloza's army. Yes, Paunero had many officers killed. It seems that Chacho and Felipe Varela got away alive Chacho and his people should be killed! La Rioja is a cave for thieves that are threatening all neighboring provinces. You think so? They say Chacho is not mean; he helps people that come to his place, fixes marriages that are not going well and helps difficult young people. Bah! He is an ignorant, has no vision and thinks the world ends in his own town; in this way we will never make any progress! We need to turn to Europe, everything is there! Only in this way will we be able to make it; not just by watching the flatlands and those savages that are with Varela and Chacho. They say that Varela and Chacho were camping with Santos Guayama and a clairvoyant, that Indian Chumba... A clairvoyant! Who are their trusted men at the Abrojal. There they are! Tell us what you saw were there many dead? Hey, answer! Stop! Did they cut off your tongue? Oh my God! Why! Oh My God! Who is it? Me, dad, Diego. I'm coming wait, I'm looking for the keys... It's ok... I just wanted to let you know that mom pressed charges against you. Against whom? Against you dad. Why? She says you're not giving her the money you had arranged... But I told her to wait for a couple of days. Dad! that was six months ago But she doesn't understand that they will take away my benefit! Go and tell her to drop the charges now! No Dad, you know mom is very angry at you and she is right somehow. But, how do you know she's right about it or not? Do you have any idea of what I'm going through? Hey wait Dad, what's wrong with you? Don't you take it on me... You will never change. I don't know why I'm here, bye!!! No, Diego! Diego! Hi Paula? This is Luciano, do you remember me? Listen, have you already hired an actor for the Brochero role? Spiritual exercises were very important in Brochero's life, since the time he was at the seminary... You have to makeup. Then we continue talking. What were the exercises? A religious practice of the church to find out and know what God's will in our life is and thus reorder our lives accordingly. Reorder your life! That's what my wife tells me to do, well, my ex-wife in fact! And so, what happened? Did Brochero do these exercises? Sure! He did them at the seminary, but it came the time when he had to make the decision and to ask the bishop to ordain him as a priest, and he was assaulted by doubts. He started to feel what Saint Ignatius calls “spiritual desolation... Spiritual de-so-la-tion? Yes, he felt he couldn't pray, couldn't think, he was sad, had nightmares... In fact, he wasn't sure about becoming a priest, he felt it was too much for him. He was desolated. That's why he talked to Father Bustamante. I'm very much afraid of becoming a priest. And I wonder if I will be able to be faithful to my vocation... Look, son... We're all sinners, and we are full of limitations. God, does great things with us small creatures. Because, the important thing, is not that you preach great. Try to love him, and serve him, faithfully. He will take care of the rest. Good afternoon your Excellence, you wanted to talk to me... Yes, Father. Sit down, please. You know that, when we ordain as priests, we commit ourselves to go where God wants us to go, and that is a lifetime duty. I remind you that because, I have a new task for you. You are going to the west as soon as possible, since the San Alberto parish is without a parish priest. Look... In this map, is all this area you see here. Get a local guide to help you. They told me there are people who can help you with this in the Abrojal. It will be so, your Excellence. May your Excellency bless me. Take the map with you son. May God bless you. Hello? Yo are still asleep! We're waiting for you here Luciano! Did you forget we were traveling to Brochero “early”? Okay okay, yes. You guys have a coffee. I take a shower and I'll be there right away. Good afternoon Father! Looking for someone? The parish priest left a few days ago... Yes. I'm the new parish priest I've just arrived from San Pedro. My name is José Gabriel Brochero. Pardon me! God bless you! I'm Juan, I'm the church clerk. The priest here left to San Juan a few days ago. I have the keys; you want me to open the door? Yes! Come in Father, let me help you. Okay... Come in Father. Excuse me. This is the room. I leave your things here. Thank you! Well, as you know, Bishop Arellano has decided to unify the parishes of San Aberto and Tránsito. And I've been committee here. Welcome then! How was your trip? A little bit tiring... Well, this place is all a mess but I'm gonna tell Palito to come and give you a hand at the church Who is Palito? Palito is a young man that wanted to become a priest but got sick and had to leave the Seminary. He's always willing to help, he's a very good person. Well Father, have a rest. If you need anything, just call me, I live in the house with the big tree in the front. Thank you. God bless you! Thank you Father. Excuse me Father. Good morning. I'm Palito. Well, everybody call me like that around here. Yes.. how are you doing? I've been told about you. They tell me you can help me at the church. Oh. Yes, Father! Look, I brought you some "arrope" and vegetables from Mr. Jose's orchard. I'll leave them here. It seems you've had a good harvest around here. Yes, many things are sown here. But some people are having trouble with the water, The weather is very dry around here. But the river is very close here. You should build irrigation channels, it's easy. Excuse me. Good morning, Irineo. Good morning. Father, meet Irineo Altamirano, a very pious neighbor. Welcome to our town, Father. I wanted to meet you and put me at your service, for anything you need. Thank you. I'm Gabriel Brochero. I'm the new parish priest of Villa del Tránsito and of the San Pedro Parish. I heard you want to build some irrigation channels, do you? It seems the Father knows about these things. Yes, well, I did that in my home town. We need to find out who needs them and how to solve this, just that. But you will have a lot of things to do here, you will also build irrigation channels? Well, if I can be of any help... Look, if we don't help each other, we're calling ourselves Christians in vain. Well, Father, I don't know anything about irrigation channels... but if I can be of any help, just tell me. Count on me. I've also noticed there are very few schools. Yes, there are only five schools in the hole region. And they are full. Well, we have to ask the government to build new ones. We don't count for the government Father... Well, I'm going to get myself ready to celebrate Mass. See you later! Please, tell the people there's a new parish priest and that Mass starts at 7. See you later Father! See you! My Inmaculate... Good morning dear Father! How are you doing? I brought you this homemade bread to have with the mate. Thank you! And Juana wants to talk to you. How are you Juana? You wanted to talk to me? Juana wants to confess Father, I don't know what is it that I have to say... What are you going to say? That you're married to a man but you live with another one! Is this a sin? And.. Where's your husband? He's hanging out with Santos Guayama and sometimes comes home drunk and get... lovey-dovey... and I don't want that anymore. And Juan is good, he treats me well. He helps me with my boy... is that too bad Father? Come here, daughter. Let's talk. You can go, Josefa, I'll handle this. Let's see... do you know God loves you? Ehhhhhhh... Father!!! Open up! Who are you? Rafael Pereyra, at your service. You are drunk, that's not the way to come to church. I'm not drunk... I'm happy, happy What? Doesn't God have a place for me? Go home and get some sleep and come back tomorrow when you're sober Are you telling me to go to bed? I'm gonna go to bed because Rafael wants to! Just what I needed! Drunkards... What am I going to do with these people you have commended me Lord? What am I going to do? Hi Santiago! Yeah, yeah. I'm coming, I was having something cold. Yes, I'm ok. Okay, I'm coming. Why on Earth did I get to star in this priest! Me! Excuse me, do you need anything else? Don't listen to you! No, no, don't listen to me, I'm talking to myself. Keep the change. Thank you. Father, I was looking for you. How are you doing Irineo... Very well How are you doing Irineo... Very well I was coming back from visiting some families and I stopped to cool off a little. That's okay. You look worried, any problem? Oh, my friend! People around here are have problems. They have many needs, and I don't know how to help them. But you do a lot for these people, what else can you do? Well, to tell you the truth, an idea has been going round my head for days. What idea? That things could get a lot better if everybody did spiritual exercises. Spiritual exercises? What's that? What are these for? To find God and everything else in Him. But people have started to attend Mass... even more than before! Yes, but sometimes it seems that they do it out of friendliness or because I help them. And not because they have discovered how much God loves them. Otherwise they would change... Look at Rafael Pereyra for example, On Sundays he gets dressed up and goes to church, but the rest of the days, he's always drunk... And he is only one example. Yeah, I know what you mean... well, let's do those exercises you say then! Yes, but we have to travel to Córdoba and it's an 8-day exercise. To Córdoba! It's like 14 days there and back plus exercise days... I find it hard... Who around here might able to go? Yes, I know... but what if this was the road to salvation for many and we're not doing it? Don't you think it's worth trying? Why don't you help me organize it? I'll go around and invite people, we make a group, get the supplies we need... What do you say? I trust you Father. If you think this is good for us all, you can count on me! Thank you friend. We'll have to get right down to it and get organized. Rafael! Look at you, I'm coming here with a proposal for you and you're drunk! I'm not drunk! Oh really? Then, listen to me. We have to travel to Córdoba to do some spiritual exercises. I'll take care of your family. Your life has to change; you can't go on like this. Now you're telling me how to live my life too. Yes, yes. You're living in sin! I don't believe in God, or the church you're in! You bet! You can tell me that, but tell HIM! Come on, tell HIM! Let's see if you dare! Come on Rafael... do it for your kids, they need you. Thing is I try... but I can't Look at the brave man... I knew you were weak! Weak never! You don't know And what do I have to do? Don't drink anymore But drinking is such a pleasure! Ok, look, here's the deal For sure you will propose something I won't be able to achieve, because it's always like this. Look, this is gonna be as hard for me as it is for you, so you can see what it is like to be strong enough to overcome a vice You know I like sweets. so you can see what it is like to be strong enough to overcome a vice You know I like sweets. Well, I promise I won't have a sweet for two years. Are you gonna do that for me? Sure! And, who will take care of my family while I'm away? I will Rafael. And when are we leaving? Right now. Go get your things so we can leave. Hi! this is Diego. Leave a message and I'll call you back later. bye Diego, this is Dad, I wanted to talk to you. Well, call me when you hear this. Diego What do you want now? Are you calling me again to insult me, I'm sick of you being so aggressive, don't call me again! Hey, wait Diego, calm down... I'm changing You don't change anymore! It's been years I've been waiting for you to change, don't hurt me anymore please! Give me a chance Diego, Diego... Waiter, a beer! You sleep so well here... Easy, I've only been waiting for you for half an hour Well, we could have met a little closer to the Inn where we're staying! You're right but the people that will lend us the horses for the movie live around here. That's a beautiful animal! I like animals a lot... what I most like about animals is that they don't ask you for anything and are good buddies and if you give them food, that's enough for them You live alone? Yeah... I do now... I separated a year ago Got any children? Yeah, one, Diego but we don't get along very well. You know, nobody seems to understand the life I choose to live I like acting, going from one place to another, being free... just like wild animals Now that we're on the subject of animals, that reminds me of an anecdote from Brochero Yeah? What happened? Some neighbors were fighting over who a foal owner was... and there was this Prudencio, who was like a kind of mediator. Brochero got the neighbors together and told them to bring in their mares and Prudencio brought in the foal and put it in the middle of the mares; the mare that was the foal's mother immediately run to the foal and started cuddling him, the other mare just stood there grazing. It's obvious who the mother is. Did you realize how the mother recognized the foal? How about you? When are you going to do the same? I don't have a mare or a foal You are going to have a child with Edelmira and you don't want to recognize the baby. You see friend, that mare has recognized her foal; you want to be less than that animal? Marry Edelmira and take care of that child you are both going to have. When I come back here again, I'll help you in any way possible. Excuse me... Let's see, Mrs. Zoraida, give me the list of women who will be doing the exercises It's 25, including me. Well, I have asked everyone to cooperate... Mercedez de Vásquez' husband will bring in a cart full of pumpkins. Then, this one... what was her name? The short one? Romero's wife? Vicenta Romero said she would bring in two chickens. Jacinta de Díaz will bring in two bags of potatoes and... I'm missing one. The one who would bring in the tomatoes. Oh, yes, I was forgetting the one bringing in the tomatoes, Mrs. Peralta Well, I'll give this list to Palito; he's in charge of everything. Father, since I can't go, I asked my people some money for the expenses... Mr. Iriarte's wife has a grocery store, so she will bring in sugar, noodles... Caña, Caña and bottle of caña for the cold. We are 23 women in total and we have collected fifty five pesos Father. Here you have. And here's the full list. Here Mrs. Matilde Thank you I'll give this list to Palito, so he takes care of what needs to be bought and helps people who can't bring in anything... you've done a great job. Now, we have to tell everybody that on December 1, they have to be here with the mounts and winter clothing early morning. We leave at 9 more or less. “God's eternal love for man is impregnated in all wonders of Creation. Periodic season changes, the richness of plant and animal life and all the greatness and the sublimeness of the Universe preach that God loved man from eternity and laid eyes of love and predilection upon him” We thank God for these days where we will meet Him and become close to Him. We are now returning home and we ask you Lord to help us be instruments of peace and love in our families and give testimony of your presence in us. I have visited the parish towns and have noticed we're in need of chapels; people have no place to meet as a community and pray to God that' why I'm asking you to give a helping hand. Altamirano and I have made some progress in this respect... Excuse me Father, look, this is Panaholma, this is where they told you they needed a church, right? Yes, that's right. And a little bit more to the south, in Las Rosas they have donated a piece of land for building one more church. Well, I can take care of that if you want Father. Ok, great... well, as for Nono and Panaholma, we have to get people together, get organized and create a committee to be in charge of collecting the money and materials to get the work started... Father, now that you're getting organized with all this... Some neighbors found out that you helped some people build a road; so, they would like you to help them build another one, they really need it. They already got many materials and offered to help in anything we need... Yes! We need many roads. Ah Father! There's somebody out there that brought in some animals to collaborate... You see? God never turns his back on us... Palito, please, take care of that, ok? When I visit the town I'll collect the things people will donate us and then we have to sell them and with that money, Let's get started then! I heard about your leg Father. Is it any better? Well, thank God, it was not serious. But what was it then? The frost? Yes, we were coming back from Córdoba after doing the exercises, and my feet got wet and with the cold, my blood stopped circulating and my feet got swollen. It was awful And what did you do? If it hadn't been for my friends that acted quickly and slaughtered a sheep to heat my feet with its intestines, I wouldn't be talking to you now! Travelling to Córdoba at this time of the year is complicated... it's freezing everywhere. Look Father, the exercises are helping people a lot... but traveling to Córdoba, Father, it's... I wanted to talk precisely about that... I have the solution! The solution? Yes! I want to build a House of Exercises here! Here Father? Yes! But where are you going to get the money from? Where are you going to get everything? The way we have done everything! The way we built the roads, the churches... we have to get organized and create a committee. But we're going to need a lot of people! Yes, that's true. I already talked to Dr. Aguirre a while ago... I'm ready to do it. I was thinking that we could take advantage of the Virgin celebration to get started because a lot of people from everywhere are coming that day and they can help us start building the foundations... I also thought that we could build the house here, in the lot next to us. Where are you going Father? To visit the ranches and ask them to help us with the building of the house So, you're begging... Something like that. Can you imagine Palito? A House of Exercises here in Tránsito Can you imagine Palito? A House of Exercises here in Tránsito and not having to go to Córdoba anymore? And how long are you going to take? Whatever it takes Listen, if you're going far away, take someone with you; that animal may throw you off and you'll get hurt Well, then I'm going to ask Mr. Pedro Miranda to come with me; he knows all the roads to San Luis, San Juan and La Rioja. I'll be back on August 15 for the Mary Most Pure celebration; you take care of everything. Yes, don't worry about anything Father. Everything will be ready when you're back. Hi Father! How was everything? Hi Palito! I can't even sit down! My butt hurts a lot after so much riding, but the trip was ok, everybody gave us something, even the poorest gave us a goat or a sheep. Please, get me some mallow leaves; I'll boil them to have a sitz bath. Yeah... right away Excuse me. Hello Father, how's it going? How was your trip? Great, but my ass hurts a lot How far did you go? We went up to La Rioja flatlands to collect animals and money. Upon return, in Chancaní and San Vicente, they gave us more animals... they have all been too generous to us. That's great Father! And where did you put so many animals? We left them at Mr. Juan Pío Rodriguez so he sells them. Good morning, how are you today Mr. Irineo? Good morning, I'm fine. Did you and Mr. Miranda alone bring all those animals? No, no, we hired two farmhands to help us. Pay and meals took $50 $50? Ok, let's see... Here, have the $50 you spent, I'll write it down in the expense book. Father... Ouch Palito, I can't get out of bed. Just now! Do me a favor, tell Mr. Gallardo to come and show me the changes in the drawings that I asked him to do. Ah! And tell Mr. Altamirano to come too. Ok... Oh Lord! Look at me, I can't even move. Well, I guess you're even having a worst time than me! Father... you wanted to see us? Yes, thank you for coming. I won't be able to make it today. So, please, Mr. Altamirano, take care of organizing the work... But before that, everybody gets in the church and says a Lord's Prayer and five Hail Marys Most Pure. Palito, take an animal and have it cut to pieces to feed these people. I think I'm clear about what you want; a large patio with galleries and rooms around the patio. And for how many people? Over a hundred... No, that's not enough... In the last trip to Córdoba, we had almost three hundred men exercises so, go figure... We will double that number here! So, please consider building another patio and more rooms. Yes, we can do that, but I suggest building this first part with the funds we have available now and then we enlarge it... what do you think? Ok. Well, we have to get started, right? Keep cool Father; the people have already cleared up the lot. Fidel has already started surveying the lot and the workers are stringing the line to soon start digging the foundation. Many people are working there I think it will be finished by midday. Ok, ok. Tell them that on Sunday after Mass, we'll lay the first concrete block. Everyone has to be there! Yes, yes, sure Father. You rest now! Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by Thy name, Thy kingdom come... Let's sing hymns of praise! Glory be to God and his mother Virgin Mary Most Pure In the Saint Exercises, the Lord has taught me and you that man must first lose his honour, his goods or wealth and his own life before losing God. You are the heart of the family, the source of your children and husbands' virtue. For this reason, I have wanted to found a school for girls that will guide them in such a noble mission. Father... Palito... The Funes... What's wrong with the Funes? You don't wanna know what happened to them! What happened to them? Some rustlers of Guayama broke into their house and took away their sheep and all their harvest! Poor people! Well, they're not so poor Father, eh? Sharing a little would do them no harm Well, but robbing them of their stuff is not the solution I'm coming there right away. Ah! Mr. García's daughter asked me if you could go see her father. Mr. García? he one who's isolated because of his leprosy? They say it's contagious Yes, I'm coming. Get me some supplies that that people are very poor. Supplies? Where from? From the cupboard, Palito. Get me everything we have We'll make do with some mate and tortilla; as matter of fact, we're a little fat. Well..I would put... Well, Father, anyhow, that Santos Guayama should be locked in, eh? Good bye! If I was Guayama, a criminal, and a priest comes to me and tells me I have to change... I'll shoot him But at no time does Brochero tell him what he has to do or judge him Brochero wanted to help him He wanted to help who? Didn't Brochero help his people? Well, yes, he also helped his town people when they were sacked by Santos' rustlers Yes, but Santos and his people got it worse, so, here Santos is the victim Guayama a victim? I think you're getting it wrong Come on, Brochero wanted to shake off the problem, he wanted to the hero, he didn't care about that man's life, he just cared about his parish. No, Brochero, loved that people and he also loved Santos... Don't be so naive! Come on! It's always the same... people only want to shake off the problem, they promise solutions, they give you a subsidy or a handout and that's it. They now have their conscience clear. It's easy to judge people; this is lazy, that is a drunkard, a criminal, promiscuous, and, what about the person? What about his personal history? No one really gets involved... the only thing they're interested in is that you stay away from them. It's the same thing the priest wants to do by shaking off Santos's problem. He didn't understand who Brochero was! He doesn't know him yet. But, what intentions could he have had? He only wanted to help... Where's he gone now? I'm sure he's in one of the bars around. Want me to find him? Yes, please! But not now, leave him alone for now and we'll find him later. Shall we continue? Father, I'm sorry I'm coming at this time, but Jaime is dying, please come and see him. Where does Jaime live? In the ranch crossing the river. Wait, I'll pick up my things and we go. Yes, Father. What's wrong? Come in and light a candle Why did you call me so late? He's been dead for hours! I don't know. He was alive when I left. What does all this mean? Forgive him Sir, forgive him! What do I have to forgive? This man wanted to kill you! Kill me? Why? I haven't done anything to him He was dating this woman... you told her not to live with a man without getting married by church so she left him. And you're as guilty as him! You're an abettor! You came for me! Forgive me Father, forgive me, he convinced me! Ok, ok, You must be the priest from Tránsito that wants to take me to do the exercises! No, Mr. Santos! Let me explain this. You think you're a Saint! Now we'll see if you go to Heaven or Hell! No, Mr. Santos. No, no... Did you know my brother is coming over? I didn't know you had a brother, does he live in Córdoba? Yes, he works with the Jesuits Fathers. He's a cabinetmaker, a wood carver. Yesterday we were walking by the river with Mr. Aguirre and found a log and I kept it to do something special so, your brother could help me with this. What do you want to do with it? A Christ! You think your brother can do it? Yes! Of course! He's very talented, he's good. Well, tell him to come see me when he comes. And he can stay here if he wants; I'll be away for a couple of days Ah, he's going to love the idea. And tell me Father, are you thinking of going around? No, no. I'm going to find Santos Guayama Father! He might kill you! Don't you know he's a murderer? I know he's been accused of killing people. You think it's worth risking your life for a criminal? People like that don't change anymore. Instead, here there are a lot of people who want to be good people and they will be left without their master if something happened to you. Think about it. I have already thought about it. Doesn't the Bible say that the good Shepherd goes find the lost sheep even if he has to leave the rest alone? Well, that's what I'm going to do. Look, come here, you see that tree? Your brother who is a great artist could make a beautiful carving out of that tree... Sure. Of Jesus Christ Well, just as that piece of art is inside that tree, God is inside every person, but sin hides that God inside us. Even though we can't see it, all that beauty is inside. God lives in every one of us, no matter how much we have sinned; and it's also alive in Santos Guayama even if he doesn't want or accept Him... that's why I want to help him. I understand... Take good care of you Father. “I understand that becoming a priest means working for the good of your fellow man until the end of life, fighting the soul's enemies... Your soul's enemies are just like lions, who fight lied down when they cannot fight standing anymore” What do we do with the priest? Go see what he wants, but if you notice something weird, shoot him down. Yes, sir Manolo! Don't go alone Whatever you say, sir He's taking out a gun, shoot! Don't shoot, don't shoot! This is just my rosary. You know it's dangerous to be around here. Yes, I know. I'm looking for Santos Guayama What do you want? I want to talk to him I've come by myself and unarmed. Who's looking for me? I'm the priest from Tránsito, José Gabriel Brochero And what do you want? I want to talk to you What do you want to talk to me about? You guys go away You think we do not have anything to talk about, but I think we have a lot in common So what? They told me you stand up for what you believe and you do it for your people and for a cause you think is just and thus, you have risked your life many times. Yeah, that's right Well, it seems we are just the same In my case, I believe in Jesus Christ and would do anything for others to know and follow him Do you understand? I'm a warrior of Jesus Christ and fight against evil for all people to get to know how much God loves them. And I'm also concerned about my people; I want them to have everything they need And I believe that Jesus Christ is the way. So, you're a warrior. And what do you want from me? You want me to join your army? Something like that... In fact, we would have to ask God, right? He was the one who made me walk 80 leagues “risking my life” to search for this sheep he so much loves. I am that sheep? And tell me, did you walk 80 leagues from Tránsito to help me? Yes, and I would do many more things to help you. And, how are you going to help me? Haven't you thought about changing your life? It's not that easy you know... don't you know that I have a price on my head? What if I just got you a reprieve? You can't! you don't know what you're saying, I'm wanted for murder, robbery and I don't know how many more charges; besides, I have a debt that if don't pay, I'm a dead man, they won't condone this debt so easily! Well, but suppose I foot the bill for you and get you a reprieve; would you change your life? And what's the point in doing this? What do you want? What do I want? I want to please God You are crazy! I don't want anything for me, Mr. Santos. I love God and want to fulfil God's will. God loves you and I want to help you, believe me, I just want to help you. And what do you want me to do? We are building a House of Spiritual Exercises in Tránsito And that? What's that? People go there and stay for 8 days to meet God and get to know Him. I don't know... If you're going to talk about morals and God all day, I don't think that could help me. Look Mr. Santos, God made us free, free to follow him or not, but one can't choose what one doesn't know. You already know what the life you're having offers you, where it took you and where it may take you. What I'm offering you is to know another way, the way God has planned for you. Come, do the spiritual exercises and if after that you don't want to continue, you're free to go back to this life. Will I be free after that? Here's the deal. I commit myself to foot the bill for you and to get you a reprieve, but in return, you and your men have to come and do the spiritual exercises. What do you say? The truth is, I'm tired of this life, always carrying a gun even for sleeping, not having a house, going from one place to another and even stealing for getting something to eat... Well, get me that reprieve and I'll go to see that thing of the exercises with my men. Deal, Mr. Santos Now come, get something to eat and get a rest before going home Father, look at this! This telegram is not enough! Why? You don't trust Roca? Roca? Come on Mr Brochero... didn't you tell me that you were at ”The Beaches” administering the sacraments to the dead? Roca wasn't there? Wasn't he in charge of those who killed us like flies? What can we do then Mr. Santos? The only thing that has value is the reprieve. Without the reprieve, I won't leave the flatlands. What about you? Your facial expression tells me it's bad news. They say he was in jail and they found him dead in his cell at dawn No, no! Was it a setup? Poor Santos! Santiago... one question, did Santos ever go to do the exercises? No, he didn't but Gaucho Seco did. Gaucho Seco? Another rustler? Yes, he and three more bandits. So, di it all end with shots being fired? No, no. We should have been there to see it all, but they say that Brochero separated them to be able to control them, but anyhow, now and again, some would just leave for a drink... Yeah.. I can figure it out But since Brochero knew what he was doing, he spoke to the priest that preached there and told him to exaggerate when he spoke about Hell to scare them. But it didn't work. But no one believes that. I don't get you Luciano. I mean that no one's going to change his life even if you threaten them with that... that thing of Hell and fire are hard to believe. Ahhh, the thing is that the concept of Hell is now seen in a different way. People were really afraid of Hell before, so they tried not to sin Not to sin! You really believe all this? You're so naive! You really think people change their life just like in movies, that a few nice words will change the world? The story of the priest riding in the sierras may be very nice but nobody knows what living in hell is... What were they talking about? I don't know... I'm worried about “whom” they were talking about Luciano, we are waiting for you to continue shooting Santi, there are a couple of things I would like to talk to you about Why are you speaking in such a low voice if no one's listening? It's just that I don't want the guys to know about this. What? We're having some problems with the catering service ¡Santiagooo! What is it? Luciano fell down the mule! What? What happened? They were rehearsing and he fell down, he lost balance Ooops! If he lost balance, I guess how drunk he may have been But, how did you let him ride like this? Where are they now? He went to hospital with Juan to get an x-ray done Well, I'm going to the hospital. Paula, would you please take care of the rest of the team? Yeah, easy man And how long will he be in hospital? What did the doctors say? Luciano will be ok and he will suffer no long term physical damages. He really hit hard, so he will have to rest for 10 days. 10 days! We will miss the beatification! I don't know. It doesn't matter, what matters is that Luciano is ok. However, he's angry with the Production Manager. Why? I'll call him now. No, wait. He doesn't want to talk to anyone right now. We'll talk to him tomorrow when he's calmed down. We're all invited on September 14, at 10 am in Cura Brochero to participate in the beatification of this exemplary priest, José Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, who reminds us all of our vocation. You are all invited to participate with your prayers. Very close to Falda del Cañete, a miracle occurred after a very tragic accident where three people died. Nicolás, an 11-month old baby saved his life, and this inexplicable fact for science has become known as Brocheros' miracle. Good afternoon, this is Diego. Leave your message and I'll call you back. Bye Luciano, Luciano, Luciano, are you ok? Luciano, what's wrong? Are you ok? Yeah, yes. What are you doing here? Who let you in? The building doorman gave me the keys. I've been knocking for a while. Are you ok? Yeah. I'm sorry, I took some pills for sleeping. That's why I didn't hear the door. Listen, have you had lunch already? No Ok, look, I bought you lunch and I brought you a book they gave me You can read it when you feel ok Look at you... Why don't you let us take care of you, ah? We can take turns and stay with you, bring you anything you need, ok? Come on... Yes. Ok. I really need help. Thank you... Get some sleep now. Is Luciano here already? At this time? He never gets here early Hi! How are you today? Luciano! You really look good! Hi Luciano.. how are you doing? I'm ok! Shall we start filming? Yeah! Let's get started! I'm going to change clothes “Jesus invites us softly, with sweet words to follow Him and remain under his care. Our health and life, our heart's strength, our soul's joy and heaven's hope are in the Holy Cross” Brochero got infected with leprosy, blind, alone, isolated, because people didn't want to get infected. Ouch! Poor guy! In the final take, he gives the Virgin Mass, as he did daily, by heart. And? Is that a happy ending? Well, it's the life of a man that wanted to become a Saint, a friend of God With Friends like that, I'd rather be alone! We are used to happy endings Luciano because we want to avoid pain at all cost Yes! Absolutely! Well, but that's absurd, because pain as well as joy are part of life. Even a pregnant woman knows she has to go through a lot of pain to hold her child in her arms. It's a natural process. And... How did Brochero go through all this? Brochero went through that moment as any other moment in his life; with a lot of faith and dedication. He trusted that that was good for his purification and for everybody's good. Sometimes Luciano, we have to go through darkness to reach the light, even if we're afraid to, believe me, it's a necessary step. God is the only one who gives us the courage to do it, we're not alone. That's what this take says... This is what gives sense to Brochero's final sacrifice... He died the way he lived. His life's engine was his love for God and his people, who were the flock God had commended him... What a man, huh? A great man.. And we're called to be like him To become Saints? Let's go? “You see Yaniz, how “Chesche” is now, this energetic and spirited horse. But it's a great favor God our Lord has done me at freeing me from an active life and giving me this passive life; I mean, God gives me the task of living the end end of my life and praying for men past, present and yet to come until the end of times” “I have been able to see that I'm going to live forever in my serranos' hearts”, said Priest Brochero. And, indeed, today there are more than 200 thousand people, from everywhere that have come to celebrate the Gaucho priest's beatification. José Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, a diocesan priest, a pastor according to the heart of Christ, a minister of the word of God, a witness of Christ's love for the poor, be beatified and from now on called Blessed
