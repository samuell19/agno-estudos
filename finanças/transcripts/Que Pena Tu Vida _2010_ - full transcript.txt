How was my relationship with Sofia? let's see... Javier Javier and Sofia? They're a pain! Where do I start? I hate people that say that Mexico City is a shitty place How are they not going to say that when we are drowning in smog There are many pretty days when we can even see the volcanos Yes, very pretty... But what can you tell me about traffic. I feel like I've spent more than half of my life in a car. It's like that in every major city, but this city is beautiful! As modern as any other, and as ancient as it's roots. Besides, at the end everyone looks at their city they way they want to. In spite of its bullshit, I love my city! In spite of its bullshit, I love my city? When did you become a poet? I don't know, maybe what I love the most about this city... it's that you live here Yeah right Javier! Sofia... I know we've only been dating for a couple weeks but.... I love you Thank you I really have to go, I'm late I'll see you later?... ciao Taxi! I told her I love you I told you to wait for three months I couldn't wait Don't be so intense, stop stalking her for a few days But I know she feels the same F·%K MY LIFE F·%K MY LIFE It's been scientifically proven that we all have a soul mate And how can you scientifically prove something like that? When I met Sofia, I was sure I had found my soul mate Let's see How did I meet Sofia? We met at a campaign I made for the publicity agency Javier Yes Everything all right? Great! Good, good I have good news for you What do you mean? Come to my office I got promoted to Social Media Platform Director with all its benefits It carries your style Youthful but classy I don't see you with a different one Listen to me, I'm a publicist so don't come up with those lines No, I was just saying because of your shirt they are the same color This is the one! I'm taking it with me What do you think? Well, it's a little expensive for its size... Don't you think? It doesn't matter where you work, your lifestyle is what gives you the status Don't use those slogans on me, I make a living out of them When will it be ready? Two months We met while shooting a stupid video clip I made for the advertising agency Javier used to work for. She checked me out the moment I walked in He was so creepy... seriously! At the end, when everything was over, she came up to me and... nothing, she just gave me her number Obviously, I wasn't going to give him my number! I told her I had a lot of work and that I don't pick up the phone during business hours... so I just gave her my email. I gave him my email address just so he would leave me alone. One day he wrote me an email and asked me to go to a party with him. I said I couldn't go, but he insisted and begged me, and begged me, until I got sick of it and I said yes. I agreed to go out with him Four? Are you alive? Hey... so.... How was it? How was what? Last night Us Where is the bathroom?

The campaign The campaign Paul Izquierdo uses anti wrinkle cream every day He also likes to wear fashionable clothes He uses his fame to get girls that are at least 10 years younger than him What is this shit? What does this mean? What's important here is that We need to sell lots of records, right?

And for me Louis Armstrong it's a big one! Really, a big one.... yes... Is that the number two edition of The Lost Island? Really? Wow! Since when do you like comics? Since I was little I went to school for advertising, but my dream has always been to draw comics My ex works at an editorial He has an enormous collection of these little magazines Are you serious?

Not everything lasts thirty seconds Although lately...you do Well, we had our differences What did I like the most about my relationship with Sofia? Everything We were the perfect couple I loved to make her laugh I liked that she was more educated than me I liked that she wasn't afraid to play She fulfilled all of my stupid fantasies All of them! But more than anything I loved dancing with her Anywhere I loved Sofia, but but where were we heading? To get married? To smell our farts until the day we died?

It's just that I got pregnant on the last time with Raul... and these hormones get me really horny! No Poopy! Poopy! What are you doing? The Dr. said that it's ok for me to have sex, that I won't get pregnant again. We can do it without a condom Are you serious? Mariana, no! You're crazy! Poopy! You are crazy! Poopy don't leave! Please! Poopy! Poopy! I looked everywhere for you And you didn't reply to any of my calls or texts My phone was off Do you think I'm stupid or what? What happens is that every time that you see a moving vagina you forget about everything else! You left me alone! Andrea if you would've been with someone, I wouldn't have cared. If I would've wanted to go with someone, I wouldn't have done it, because I said I was leaving with you Because that's what friends do! And you didn't give a fuck I was gone only for a little while You do realize? What? That I'm always the last thing on your mind, and you are always the first thing on mine. I honestly don't know why am I even friends with someone as immature and selfish as you. Come on relax You are jealous What did you just said? That you are jealous because I ran into my ex Get out! What? Get out of my car! And how am I supposed to get home? Get an UBER Or even better, call your fat ex girlfriend She's skinny now She even looks hot I don’t give a fuck Get out of my car Now!

We are already five but I have an extra room that I can rent you. Are you serious? Of course dude!! Cool! This is the best room in the house It blocks the noise, light doesn't bother you in the mornings, it's really comfortable What do you think? You have a pipe there so you can work out or if you want to turn it into an urban closet... that's a very popular style now What do you think? It has its own bathroom you just have to clean it up a bit Its great! I wanted this room for myself but well...No. Ok let's see We are all set Oh I forgot, that door upstairs it locks on the outside if you want to leave just give me a call and I'll come and open it for you if I have a chance.
