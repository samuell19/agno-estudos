And now a proclamation from His Majesty the King. "During these very trying times for our nation -". - I encourage everyone throughout our land - - to maintain appropriate and dignified behaviour, - - as any hasty act or utterance - - could have the most dire consequences. May God save us all. May God save Denmark. "Christian Rex, Amalienborg, April 9th, 1940." In the early morning on April 9th, 1940 German forces invade Denmark. The ill-equipped Danish army faces the strongest army in Europe. The most violent battles take place in the south of Jutland. The lieutenant asked me to drive you directly to the exercise area. Tension is growing in the barracks. They've communicated with Copenhagen, but they're not telling us anything. I know as little as you, Sergeant. April 8th, 1940 Søgård, 12 kilometres from the border. She doesn't answer, so I lean in towards her. - Do you know what she said? - No. That she doesn't want a bloody soldier. Pick up the pace. We're in a hurry. - What did you do? - I worked with my dad. I didn't see Ingrid all that much. You'll see her soon. - What about you, Gram? - What about me? - What have you been doing? - Wouldn't you like to know. Then you could make fun of me. - You always think the worst of me. - Yes. Come on, Gram. Tell us. If you really want to know, - - I was at my parent's place. I was getting my laundry done. I read a book. Sometimes I feel so sad for you, Gram. Gram? Why do you think they cut our leave short? You were told the same as us. It's an alarm drill. It's just an exercise. - Second Lieutenant. - Lieutenant. Here we are again. Someone's been crying wolf again. I thought it wasn't just an exercise. We've received intelligence on movements of munitions in Kiel. A train full of troops has been seen heading north towards the border. That doesn't sound good. The General Staff is also worried, so all leave has been revoked. They've even sent a motorcycle unit down here. We're their support unit. They're led by a Sergeant Bundgaard. 225 and entourage reporting for duty. You're too late. Get your weapons and join in the target practice. Those three enlisted men. Assign them to kitchen duty for the week. Affirmative, Lieutenant. Kitchen duty for a week. Very good. 221, fire. Good shot. 212, fire. Try again. 212, pull yourself together. This is serious business. I don't know whom I fear the most, Lassen or the Germans. - I'll miss if you laugh at me. - You'll miss either way. Anything to drink? - Coffee, please. - Cognac. I think the Germans are headed for Norway. They want to take Norwegian waters. Denmark has no strategic value. Our southern neighbours haven't exactly been predictable recently. Thank you. You must be tired. When did you get up? At 3am. I tried to sneak out, but I woke up the entire family. Hopefully your wife wasn't too worried. I didn't say anything but my wife knows me too well. It's not the first time the Germans have been at the border. - Let's just see. - Finish the target practice. Unload. Next exercise is by the bicycles. To the bicycles. March. - Good morning, Gram. - Good to see you. - Did you improve your shooting? - Faster! To the bicycles! - Ready, Sergeant. - Ready, Sergeant! Very well. First drill. Changing the front tube. Two minutes. - Do you have them? - Yes. Help me. Come on. - Hand me the tyre. - Faster. Come on. - Hold this. - Get the wheel back on the bicycles. - Hold on. Get it up there. - Fasten those nuts. - Ready, Sergeant. - Ready, Sergeant! Thank you. - Lieutenant. - Do it again. - This time in under 90 seconds. - 90 seconds? Yes, sir. Alright. Let's do it again, this time in under 90 seconds. What are you waiting for? - Come on, Lassen. - Faster! - 90 seconds! - He must be out of his mind. Kolding, are you going to eat all your bread? - Yes, Justesen, I am. - Still hungry, Justesen? Easy now. You don't have to roll your way home. You city folk are chatty when you're together. But when you're alone - - I don't hear a peep out of you. How long do you think we have to do this, Gram? Until we can do it in less than 90 seconds. We've tried. It's not going to happen. The Second Lieutenant just wants to see us sweat. The wife probably wasn't as nice to him as he'd have liked. - He's your superior officer. - Yes. But he can't hear me. Unless you squeal, Mr. Barracks Duty. Lieutenant, I have an important message from the Lieutenant Colonel. Abort the exercise and return to barracks. After a quick meal everybody should sleep in uniform. - What's happened? - We've received new intel. A German column - - is marching towards the border. It's several kilometres long. The Lieutenant Colonel doesn't want anyone to panic. This is still to be called an exercise. Sergeant Klostergaard, stop eating. We're heading towards the barracks. You heard the Lieutenant! Get up! To the bicycles! Eyes front! You will be issued 40 rounds and a med kit. March straight to your room and go to bed in uniform. You'll wear both your uniform and boots and keep your equipment ready. From now on your dog-tags are to be worn at all times. Turn right! Get to it. 40 rounds each? Do you still think it's an exercise, Gram? They deserve to know what's going on. Yes. But it's not our decision to make, Second Lieutenant. Checkpoint 3 here. There is heavy activity on the other side. I repeat. Heavy activity on the German side of the border. Roger that. Have the Germans crossed the border? No, but we can hear heavy activity. - How large a force? - How large a force? That's hard to tell. We can't see them. We can only hear them. What are our orders? Stand by and await further instructions. Checkpoint 3, stay there. Stand by and await further instructions. - Yes, sir. Roger that. - Padborg, Krusaa and now Rens. There's no longer any doubt about their intentions. Get me the head of the Jutland Division again. Haderslev and Sønderborg are also on red alert. They're waiting for permission to leave. They're 50 kilometres away. The first hour we're alone. Lieutenant Colonel? The head of the Jutland Division. Turn off the loudspeaker. Major General? Three checkpoints report rising troop activity. I implore you to let me take my troops to the border - - and have them take a defensive position. I realise that, Major General, but we're 10 kilometres from the border. If we wait here for them to cross there's no time to take position. Has the General Staff considered persuading the Minister? Considering the recent escalation. Yes, Major General. We'll do our best. No news so far. We'll stay on red alert for now. The Prime Minister feels that any Danish mobilization - - might be viewed as confrontational. Defense strategy is a confrontation? And the German manoeuvres aren't? - Keep your opinions to your self. - Yes, lieutenant Colonel. Sorry. Gentlemen, get your men ready to march. Yes, Lieutenant Colonel. - Sergeant Klostergaard? - Yes. - Room inspection. - Yes, Second Lieutenant. Shouldn't we have taken a defensive position? Yes, we should. You can thank your prime minister for this situation. May I see the photo? - Can I have it back, please? - Easy now. There's not much that we can do. Not everybody's an excellent shot. Come on. Hi, Lassen. Are you getting any sleep? Not much, no. - Are you nervous, Lassen? - Yes. Yes. It's not everyday they supply us with ammunition. - 40 rounds each isn't much. - No we didn't get a lot. Can we have some of yours? It's not for me. I have the machine gun. It's for Lundgren. I don't think we're allowed to do that, Andersen. Lassen, you're not the best shot here. You know that. But Lundgren We know what he can do with a rifle. - Just half of them. - 20 rounds. It's for all our sakes. - Yes. - Good. Lassen, stop. Don't do it. We each received 40 rounds. No one's getting any more than that. - The two of you should be in bed. - Yes, Mr. Barracks Duty. - I'm serious. - Gram, it's okay. - I don't mind. - What's the problem? It's not up to you to decide, and you know that. - Gram, don't you want a victory? - Of course I do. You're German, right? Maybe you don't want a victory. I'm proud to call myself a Dane. - But you're not. - That's exactly what I am. - Your father's German, right? - Yes. - Then you're German, too. - You're thicker than I thought. This is not a game. Let's save it for tomorrow, eh? - Go back to sleep. - It's hard with you squabbling. No one's speaking to you, Justesen. I'm serious, Andersen. Get into your bed. Right now. - Or what? - Just go to bed. - What's going on in here? - Attention! You were to go to bed in uniform! And look at you! I have better things to do than to keep an eye on you! How hard is it to button a jacket? Your buttons are crooked! Do it again! 225, you're on barracks duty. This is your responsibility! Yes, Sergeant. Button those jackets. - Finish that letter and go to bed. - Yes, Second Lieutenant. This room will be completely quiet in two minutes! As you were! - Need a match, Second Lieutenant? - I think so. - Are your men sleeping? - They're trying to. It's hard in a uniform. I thought that that order was directed at everyone except the officers. - You're Bundgaard? - Yes. I understand we're supporting your unit. - If they cross the border. - When they cross the border. We'll probably be the first to face them. Somebody has to go first. - Can I have one? - Of course. Well Cycle as hard as you can getting there. - We'll need you there. - We'll be there. We're faster than you think. - Keep the matches. - Thank you. - Sergeant Bundgaard. - Second Lieutenant. If the Germans wanted to attack they'd have done it by now. Someone's sitting somewhere negotiating. No one's interested in a direct confrontation. Something's going on in the radio room. Checkpoint 3. Please repeat. German troops are on the move. What can you see? We can see some infantry and armoured vehicles. - They're coming straight at us. - Have they crossed the border? Checkpoint 3? The border's breached. We're under fire! What ...? Checkpoint 3, please repeat. Checkpoint 3, come in. You heard him. The enemy has breached our border. Denmark is in a state of war. Gentlemen, now's the time to show what we're made of. Alert! Alert! Come on! On your bikes! Quickly! Come on, Kolding. - 2nd Bicycle Platoon, let's go! - Yes, Sergeant. Next. Second Lieutenant, 219, 4th Company, 2nd Platoon. Machine gun. Next. Second Lieutenant, 223, 4th Company, 2nd Platoon, assistant. - Next. - 217, 4th Company, 2nd Platoon. - Assistant. - Next. - 233, help him with the tripod. - Yes, sir. - Ready? - Yes, Sergeant! - 217, are you ready? 212? - Yes, Sergeant! Correct that rifle! 219, are you ready? Yes, Sergeant! The Germans have breached the border in three places, among them Krusaa. They're coming straight at us on Highway 10. If we can hold that road, the Germans can't move north. Any news from the other barracks? Haderslev and Sønderborg are on their way. We have to hold the enemy until help arrives. Then we force the Germans back. All new orders will come from Sønder Hostrup. We'll rendezvous at Lundtoftebjerg. Hold them back until then. We'll do our best, Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Attention! - Platoon at the ready. - Affirmative, Sergeant. A German panzer division has breached the border! This is not an exercise! Denmark is at war! Fight well! Platoon, follow me! Platoon, ready to mount your bicycles! Mount! Faster! - Halt! - Halt! Dismount! At the ready! It's the motorcycle platoon. - Maybe it's all over. - I don't think so. Halt! Lieutenant. We barely got into position. We stopped a few armoured vehicles and got some foot soldiers. - But there were too many of them. - How many? One or two motorized companies supported by armoured vehicles. We're heading north to set up proper defences. - We are to hold Lundtoftebjerg. - Lundtoftebjerg has fallen. - Then we dig ourselves down here. - Terrain's too open. Come with us. We are to hold Lundtoftebjerg until Haderslev and Sønderborg get here. - You don't know what's coming. - Do as you please. I never ignore my orders. There's no time for quarreling. Sand. You have to convince him. - I agree with him. - Be careful, Second Lieutenant. Let's move out! What's going on? - Sergeant Klostergaard! - Yes, sir! The machine gun's our best bet against their armoured vehicles. Let's split into three groups. How long until the reinforcements arrive? - At least 20 minutes. - All right. Sand, first group, in the trees. I'll take the second group. Third group on the hill. Machine gun, await my signal. Carbines, open fire when the infantry's within range. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Come on. - First group, you're with me! - Second, wait for the Lieutenant. Third group, follow me! Second group! 219, by that tree! 212, assist the machine gun group. 50 meters that way! - We'll position ourselves here, 225! - Yes, sir. Here. Good position, 219. We're standing by for the Lieutenant's orders. Short bursts. Focus on their armoured vehicles. Affirmative, Second Lieutenant. Where was the motorcycle platoon going? I need you to focus on that road. Affirmative. I'm starving. We haven't even had coffee today. - Are you thinking about that now? - I'm serious, Gram. I can't function without my morning coffee. You and your coffee. 233, get in position. Only the machine gun fires at the signal. Everyone else, wait until you see the infantry. There's a headwind. The sun has just begun to rise. - Good hunting conditions. - Quiet, Kolding. Wait. - Get down, 225. - Affirmative. Ready. Ready. - Fire! - Fire! - They're just bouncing off it! - I know! Reload! 233, wait for the infantry. Fire! Reloading! They're going for the machine gun! 225, cover the right flank! You, too, 212! Two armoured vehicles to the right. Affirmative. Reload! - Come on, 233! - Yes, Second Lieutenant. 212? - Reloading! - 233, cover the road! Yes, Second Lieutenant! Second Lieutenant, help us! I'm retreating! Retreat! Come on! Retreat! 212, follow them! 219, retreat! - You hit it! - I bloody got it! Shoot them! Shoot them! Shoot them, Kolding! Kolding! Nørreskov! Help him! - Is it bad? - Yes, it's bad! We need help! Nørreskov! Retreat! - We have to get him out of here. - Kolding. - We must retreat, Second Lieutenant. - Kolding, look at me. 223, take the ammunition bag. Take the ammunition bag. We can't do anything more here! Nothing more! Come on! 219, get the machine gun! Leave the tripod! Come on! Where's Kolding? - Where's Kolding? - Follow me. - Where's Kolding? - Control yourself! - Where is he? - Kolding's dead! Follow me! Come on! - Come on. - Nørreskov! This way! Down to that farm. 212, hide all the bicycles in the shed. Come on. Quickly. Come on, 212! Get inside. 219, take this window. 223, take that window. - 225, take that one. - Yes, sir. Give me that rifle. Pull yourself together, so we can get out of this alive. - Here. If you see anything... - What are you doing here? - No! - Easy, easy! - Get down on the floor, madam! - Oh, no! You have to remain quiet. - We won't stay long. - All right. 219, is anybody approaching? I can't see anyone. - Still no one? - No. I don't think anybody's coming. Madam, could you help wash this man's face? - Yes. - 223. - That one? - Yes. Come on. 225. We'll continue going north. Up to Sønder Hostrup. We'll get to the Lieutenant Colonel. That's where the command centre is. - They can give us new orders. - So we'll continue? What else did you have in mind, 233? Nothing, Second Lieutenant. I'm ready. 225. I need a second-in-command. That's you. 219, give 233 his rifle. Come on. There. Now you're clean again. Such a sweet boy. There. We're leaving. - Let's continue. - Yes, sir. Gentlemen. - Madam. - You can hide here. You can stay in the hayloft. No one will find you there. - To what end? We're at war. - It would save the boys' lives. I'm protecting them with everything I've got. But I refuse to hide them during a war. And they don't want that either. 20 years ago this was Germany and now it's Denmark. Perhaps I should be ashamed of this, but it doesn't matter much to me. It matters greatly to me. Thank you for your help. Attention! I don't know what's happened to the Lieutenant, - - Sergeant Klostergaard or the rest of the platoon. We're what's left. We know what we're up against. We lost a great soldier today. 217. He fought bravely but had to surrender to God's will. Let his death be a reminder to us all that we have to be prepared. Follow me. 2nd Platoon, 4th Company! Halt! 219, try to get some ammunition. The rest of you wait here. Still no response. - Lieutenant Colonel. - Second Lieutenant. Sønder Hostrup calling. Come in. Come in. Are you receiving? I repeat. Sønder Hostrup calling. Come in. - You were at Lundtoftebjerg? - We didn't hold it for very long. We were outnumbered. We were attacked by armoured vehicles and infantry. - Where is your lieutenant? - I don't know. I think the Lieutenant was captured - - or surrendered along with the rest of the platoon. And the motorcycle platoon? Sergeant Bundgaard chose to move north after the first skirmish. But we are far from defeated. We are ready to receive new orders. Get the radio on the lorry. Come on! Are you leaving? Follow me. Thank you. - Cigarette? - Yes, please. We've heard from both Haderslev and Sønderborg. - They're not coming. - There are no reinforcements coming? Why not? We were told they'd be of more use in their own region. That was the last message before we lost all communication. The telephone lines have probably been sabotaged by the enemy. - And the joint line of defence? - There'll be no line here. The border region has fallen. All units have retreated - - or surrendered, so the battle will take place further north and inland. - Any news from Copenhagen? - No, there's no contact. What are our orders, Lieutenant Colonel? We retreat to Haderslev and join the garrison there. We'll establish a line of defence there. It's going to be a long day, Sand. - Second Lieutenant. - Lieutenant Colonel. Attention! New reports have come in. There will be no reinforcements from Haderslev. Or from Sønderborg. We're going to Haderslev - - to assist the garrison in defending the town. Can I ask a question? No, 233, you can't. We're going through the woods. We should reach Haderslev before the Germans. Understood? - Yes, Second Lieutenant! - Follow me! Second lieutenant. - Yes, 212? - I have a flat tyre. We'll stop here briefly. 219, help him. - 233, stand guard over there. - 223, over there. - 225, you're from this area, right? - Yes, Second Lieutenant. The fastest way to Haderslev? I want to avoid the main road. And no open landscapes. What do you say? If we continue in this direction we'll end up on this road. Then we'll go through Aabenraa. From there we can ride the bicycles to Haderslev. - It should be possible. - Good. We'll do that. - Second Lieutenant? - Yes? 223. Nørreskov. Kolding, 217. They He was a close friend. - Make them hurry up. - Yes, Second Lieutenant. 212, 219. You have to work faster. As you were. Did you enjoy your leave? - Yes, Second Lieutenant. - Do you have a family? A fiancée. - Was it her, you wrote a letter to? - Yes. Did you set a date? Not yet, but hopefully sometime this summer. Then we'd better get you home safe. Nørreskov, you're a part of 4th Company, 2nd Bicycle Platoon. You're not alone. Affirmative. The last bit. Come on. - We're almost there. - Hurry up. - Come on, Andersen. - We need more time. There is no time to spare. - The war doesn't wait for you. - I can't do it any faster! - You have to. - Who the hell do you think you are? Come on! Get that bicycle fixed. - What's the problem? - I'm... - Having any doubts? - No. - Have you forgotten your duty? - No. - No, Second Lieutenant. - Then get that bicycle ready. Yes, sir. - Never discuss an order. - Yes, Second Lieutenant. - Ready, Second Lieutenant. - Moving on. 233, 223. 2nd Platoon, 4th Company. - Can you help? - 223, 233, assist them. Follow me. 225, you're with me. - The rest of you stay here. - Yes, sir. Hello. Want to buy some milk? It's cheap. Only two kroner. Hello. What are you doing here? Want to buy some milk? It's cheap. Only two kroner. - Sergeant Bundgaard. - Yes. - What's going on? - Second Lieutenant. We wanted to take position here, but the locals are all over the place. They refuse to go home. What about Lundtoftebjerg? - We didn't last long. - Casualties? One man. Kolding. No reinforcements. - Neither Haderslev nor Sønderborg? - No. - Our orders? - A newline of defence in Haderslev. A line of defence that far north doesn't make any sense. Those are our orders. I won't sacrifice my men for something so pointless. Get your men to Haderslev. Is that understood? - Is that understood? - Yes. - Can I see that? - Yes. - Where did you get this? - German planes dropped them on us. Second Lieutenant. German planes have been dropping these. "Proclamation to the soldiers and people of Denmark." An appeal not to offer resistance. In Norwegian. The Germans are coming! The Germans are coming! - Take position! - Get away from the road! - Get those kids away! - Second Lieutenant, our orders? 219, set up the machine gun! 212, get these people off the road! - Faster. - Get away! Get these people away! Now! Get away! - Get away! - Frederik! - Get away! - Frederik! - Frederik! - Get away from the road! Let me go! Frederik! Get away! Tanks! Take cover! Lassen, get her away! Second Lieutenant, what are your orders? - Bicycle Platoon, retreat! - Come on! Retreat! Come on, come on! - Who can drive a lorry? - I can. - 219, help load the bicycles. - Yes, sir. Come on. Get up, everybody! - Come on. - Up with it. Get us away from the main road. - Planes. Planes. - Pull over. We'll continue towards Haderslev. If we take Løgumkloster Road, we shouldn't run into the Germans. Do it. - You know the area? - Born and raised in Haderslev. - So you're going home now? - Looks like it. You did a fine job today. With all due respect, the army is just a phase for me. What would you rather do? I want to be a shopkeeper, Second Lieutenant. - A shopkeeper? - A shopkeeper. Find a nice girl. Have a lot of children. I like it simple. If you like it simple, then the army is just the thing. You could have turned the bikes around ten times by now. Yes, but the Germans are coming this way. Then hurry up. The side roads are closed. - Bundgaard. Captain. - The captain won't let us in. You're in our line of fire. Turn around. - They'll be here soon. - No entry from the south. - I need to speak to your colonel. - Colonel Hartz is on the square. You can speak to him, when you move your vehicles. I have important information about the Germans. And I have my orders, Second Lieutenant. - You haven't seen any action yet? - No. I thought so. We lost our comrades at the border while waiting for you. We need a leg up. Open wide enough for the lorry to get through. - Thank you. - Move out. We'll help defend the barracks. We'll report to the colonel. Some kind stranger gave me these. You deserve a smoke break. - Thank you. - Second Lieutenant. Move out! In Vojens. They heard it on the radio. - Dismount. - Keep quiet about it. - Get that verified. - All the telephone lines are down. Find another telephone or a radio. Colonel Hartz? Second Lieutenant Sand, 4th Company, 2nd Platoon. Lieutenant Colonel Hintz asked me to report to you. You had a busy morning. Sorry I couldn't help you - - but we were ordered to defend this town. German planes have been dropping these. I've seen them. It's a piece of paper. It doesn't change anything. The Germans have motorized infantry and armoured vehicles. - We're no match for them. - You know how it is. - Orders are orders. Nielsen! - Colonel? Show Sand and his men to the positions at the north road. They could use some help. Yes, Colonel. One of my men lost his rifle. - And we need ammunition. - See to it. God, King and country. The colonel has ordered us to a new position. Leave the knapsacks. Andersen, you'll get a new rifle. The rest of you get more ammunition. - Rifle? - That's me. - Thank you. - Ammunition? Divide it up between you. Hurry up! Follow me! We have soldiers in position there and there. If we get new orders, tell us immediately. Follow me! Get away from the street now! Get away! The colonel asked us to help you. Which weapons do you have? A machine gun here but only rifles on the other side. We need two riflemen over there. Andersen, Nørreskov. Get in position over there. Andersen, you're in command. Watch your backs. - Yes, Second Lieutenant. - Take position. Follow me! - What's going on? - The Germans are coming. Away from the window! Come on! Do you have time for that? Put those cups away! - Just a cup. - Make it quick, Justesen. I'm assuming command. Gram, Lassen, over there. Gram on top, Lassen at the bottom. Justesen, by the door. Take position there. You, take position by the corner. Lassen, move further in. You're visible. - I have a perfect vantage point. - Do as you're told, Soldier. Tanks! They're too close! Retreat! Take position there! - I'm retreating! Cover me! - I'll cover you! Nørreskov, come on! We have to move on! - Andersen, I'll cover you! - Andersen! Run! Run! - Run! - Cover him! Come on! Shoot him! - Second Lieutenant! - Andersen, Nørreskov, get back! Retreat! Take position here! Come on! Cover them! Now! Cover fire! Get in here! - Hold them as long as you can. - Yes, sir. I'm out of ammunition! - Get that machine gun! - Last three rounds! We need ammunition, Second Lieutenant! Here. Retreat! Lassen, retreat! - Coming! - Run, Lassen! Your turn, Justesen! Get back here! Gram, cover Justesen from the right side of the road! Justesen! Justesen! Lassen, we'll run out and get Justesen! Gram, you have to cover us! - Cover us, Gram! - Get him! Soldiers, cover us! Lassen, we're going now! Now! Lassen, take hold of him here. Lassen! Come on! We'll drag him back there. Put him down here. Stop the bleeding. Did you hear me? Stop the bleeding. Fall back! Get behind me! Come on! - Second Lieutenant. Nørreskov! - What are we going to do? Gram, retreat! Now! Now! Now! Look at me! Breathe! Breathe! Second Lieutenant! Second Lieutenant, we're losing him. We're almost out of ammunition. - Justesen, look at me. - Second Lieutenant, what do we do? Second Lieutenant, what are your orders? Second Lieutenant, he needs treatment! - Look at me, Justesen. - Second Lieutenant! - I don't want to die. - What do we do, Second Lieutenant? It's over. It's all over! Weapons down! Weapons down! Weapons down! Hands in the air! How do you say: "Don't shoot. We surrender"? Nicht schiessen, wir kapitulieren. Don't shoot. We surrender! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Don't shoot! - We surrender! - Don't shoot! - Hands in the air! Don't shoot. We surrender! Don't shoot! - Hands in the air! - Just keep your hands in the air. - Get behind me, soldiers. - Hands in the air! - Don't shoot. - Get behind me. Get behind me. - Don't shoot. - No weapons! We surrender! Get up! Get up! - Take the prisoners away. Now! - Get up, everybody. - Two and two, behind me. - Come on! Forward. March! Does anyone in your group speak German? - Gram. - I speak German. - Das isn't nicht notwendig. - "That's not necessary." Ich bin Oberleutnant Becker Von der 170. lnfanteriedivision. "I am Lieutenant Becker from the 170th infantry division." - Second Lieutenant Sand. - Das isn't Leutnant Sand. Sie unterstehen meiner Obhut und werden in die Kaserne gebracht. "You are in my charge and you will be escorted to the barracks." Ich hätte eine Frage. Warum um alles haben Sie so lange gekämpft? He wants to know why we kept fighting. I don't understand. What do you mean? Es war nicht notwendig, dass so viele das Leben lassen mussten. Ihre Regierung hat bereits kapituliert. It was an unnecessary waste of lives. Our government had already capitulated. Das wussten Sie nicht? Didn't you know that? No, I did not. When did we capitulate? Wann haben wir kapituliert? - Vor ein paar Stunden. - A couple of hours ago. Gut. Sie können gerne in meinem Wagen mit in die Kaserne fahren. You can ride with him in his car to the barracks. Thank you, no. I'd like to go with my men. Nein, danke. Er möchte gerne mit seinen Männern fahren. I understand. It was both disappointing - - and good that it was over so quickly - - so not a lot of Danes fell. We were forced to surrender. We were no match for the Germans. Of course we didn't like it. We didn't want them to just come and take our country. Killing people is not something you can be proud of. That's what it's about. The more you kill, the easier the victory is. I can't shake it off, because there were things, - - I thought were a bit tough. But... There's nothing to be done about that. Nothing. It was something I got through. My dad knows all my friends. He said: "I'll tell you one thing." I would rather hear - "- that Frode had fallen than that you didn't put up a fight." You're alone. No girlfriend, wife or kids, - - so if the worst thing should happen, - - it wouldn't be so bad after all. The top brass obviously said: "It was not in vain." But the price - - was too great for some. Translation: Jesper Buhl Scandinavian Text Service 2015
