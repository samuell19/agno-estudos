Ray here, Jacqui. We need the truck.' This is a bit early, isn't it, Ray? Mm. Mm. (AL) Georgie, your feet are freezing. Okay, I'll try and get him out of bed. Thought you were gonna put a new motor in that thing. A new truck more likely. Tell me, Ray. If you went halves with someone in a golden kiwi, a half-a-million job, and the other bloke didn't cough up, what would you do? Tell him I owe you five bucks. -What did you call it? -Winners and losers. Tiny, do you know if Al sorted out the back axle for the '42 Chev? Don't know. He promised it to the guy two weeks ago. (PHONE RINGS) We should try to get it to the station by midday if he's to get it next week. -Hello. Smash Palace. -'Len here. Is Al there?' Oh, Mr. Parry, no. Uh, Al's out at the moment. Did you talk to him?' Yes, I did give him your message. Well, I haven't heard a thing.' Sorry he hasn't rung you back, but he's been extremely busy. He's got a chance to sell the place. Is he too busy for that?' No, no, no. Look, we are still interested in selling. -'Get him to ring, eh?' -All right. Well, I'll try and get him to ring as soon as he gets in. -'Okay.' -Okay. Bye-bye. Bye. (SIGHS) (HORN HONKING) Do you want me to park it up the top for you? No, I'll do it later. We won, Dad! We beat you! Winning isn't everything, love. Come and have a look at the car. Get out! -Good day, Tiny. -Ray. When can I take her away? Well, I've got some trim to finish, and, uh, still waiting on some foot plates from Peru. You could drive it away now if you like. Slap them on in a couple of minutes, mate. Yeah, that's what you said a month ago. Yeah, well, I've been busy on the old route. Getting her ready for Bay Park. -Much more to do? -Put it this way, I'm winning. I got a full wheel alignment to do and that'll take a day. The young Dave's due next week with a fresh engine. Now, I'm afraid you can't rush these old babies. Uh-uh. No Coke in the car. You know better than that. It's not like your Jap crap, Ray. People who made these cars really cared about them. So, have they been keeping you busy lately? Not too bad. A spot of bother down the pub the other night. A couple of boy scouts, eh? You know, these parts come from all over the world. Like, these lenses are from the Argentine. (IMITATES CAR ENGINE) The ignition switches are from Taiwan. They're buggers. You wait for months for them to arrive, and when they get here, they've got a reverse thread. Hey, Georgie. Come on. Cut it out. -Georgie. -What? Cut it out. You'll wreck the steering box. Come on, love. Len Parry rang while you were out. Why don't you give him an answer? It worries me, that water weeping from the head. I think I'll pull it down another five. Yeah, well, I best be off. See you both tonight? Oh, I haven't got anyone to look after Georgie yet. Don't worry, Mom. I can come to the party, too. No, honey. Stay home with me and help me work on Ray's car. Oh, I don't want to go on my own, Al. It's all right. Ray'll look after you, won't you, Ray? Yeah. Best be off. Well, we'll see you both tonight. Bye. (AL) You might be lucky. Alan... (SIGHS) What? Georgie, you've got to have a bath. Georgie Shaw's only got one left to go, and she's gonna beat the rest of the field. She's way out in the front now. Go for it! Georgie, your bath is getting cold! Put your brake on. Brake! Brake! -Georgie! -What? You've got to have a bath! Do I have to go for a bath, Dad? Yeah, course you do, honey. Hey! Dad! I can breathe under water. Hey, Jac, come and have a look at this. Look. Watch this, Mom. Darling, have you rung Len Parry yet? Nah, not yet. I'll do it later. (TV) 'An incredible event, through the streets of Long Beach, and is the West Coast segment of the international Formula One racing...' -Georgie, are you hungry? -Mm, I'm starving. -Have you fed Buick yet? -No, Mom. You better hurry. The race starts soon. I better do it quick. Long Beach Grand Prix, California, in the good ol' USA. Well, there you can see the cars formed up...' Great. ...for the Grand Prix here today. What a fantastic line-up of international cars we have.' Get your grubby mitts off. Take that one. No, take that one! You've dirtied them all. 58.8 in the Chevron, and Oxen 58.9. Very shortly they'll be in the starter's hands. They're racing! The flag's down and they're racing. A fantastic start, and Millen getting the better start as they go round the right-hander. Hugh trying to move Millen outside of the circuit. And Millen's been hit. Over and over he goes. The car flies off the circuit, through the air. There you can see the car settling down on the wheels. Hopefully he's not too badly hurt. Here's the action replay. Off the circuit he comes. Over he goes. Looks like there wasn't enough room for the two cars, and arms flailing around in the air. There comes the fuel out, and back it settles onto the wheels again. Hopefully the roll bar has taken the brunt off his shoulders, and hopefully he's not too badly hurt. And the first assistance for the injured driver...' Hey, why don't you come to the party, huh? -Nah. -It'll be good fun. No, truly I don't wanna go. Look, we haven't been out together for ages, and I've organized a babysitter. Hm? As soon as I get this thing together, I promise you I'll take you out. Oh, please. Please. Hm? (AL) No, I don't wanna go. Look, I'm racing in two weeks. (SIGHS HEAVILY) Look, I'll drive you over, and Ray can drive you home. -How about that? -I'm not going, then. Don't be bloody stupid. All right. I will go, and I'll drive myself. Um, no. And don't bother waiting up for me. No, I'll drive you over. No, thank you. I'll drive myself. I'd rather drive you over. Um... The lights aren't working too well on the Chrysler. (SIGHS) How come... look, when we've got all those cars out there, huh, it's not possible for me to have one that goes properly that I can drive? Well? Well, I haven't had bloody time, have I? Look... Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with the pile of rusting junk out there, plus... That pile of rusting junk out there, my father spent a bloody lifetime getting together! (JACQUI) Well, I need a decent car! Look, Al, why won't you talk to the guy that's trying to buy this place? -Do you wanna know why? -Why? I'll tell you bloody why! Just one of those bloody cars in America is worth twice what he's offering! Yeah, well, bloody well sell them in America, then! (SIGHS) You just don't wanna leave this place, do you?

Good one. -Where did you and Mom meet? -Eh? We met in the hospital. A hospital here? No, a hospital in France. Yeah, your mom came to visit this bloke. He was in the bed next to me. Was her boyfriend. And, uh, we liked the look of each other. But I knew she really liked the look of me, when she came back to see him and he'd been discharged already. So I ate all the fruit that she'd bought for him. Then we ended up having a wheelchair race down the corridor. (CHUCKLES) Who won? Guess. -You? -No. I had a sore shoulder. Give us a, uh, seven-sixteenth. What do you wanna know all that for, anyway? Just wondered. (OVERLAPPING CHATTER, LAUGHTER) Have you eva iva ever in your leaf life loaf...

Are you embarrassed being alone with me? Yeah, I guess I am a bit. Wow. There's no need to be, is there? (SIGHS) (RAY SIGHS) Look at you. Just never seen you like this before. Well, when my old man's too busy greasing up back axles, instead of making sure that I'm not up to no good, then, um, I think I'm entitled to a bit of fun. (TRUCK APPROACHING) (ENGINE IDLES) (WHISPERS) Are you awake? -Are you awake? -(GROANS) Bloody useless car. I wish you'd fix it. It wouldn't start. Ray had to bring me home. What's the time? Oh, just past one. We'll have to go pick it up in the morning. I think it's got flat batteries, or something. (MUTTERS) ...lights off. (WATER RUNNING) (SIGHS) Good one. -Thanks for bringing Jac home. -That's okay. Silly bastard. There's was nothing wrong with the car, you know. Started first time. God, women can be half-witted at times. Take Jacqui and all that business about Fiona's 21st. You know what I'm like at parties. Usually go to sleep. Or start a fight. Shot. Beautiful shot, mate. Oh, I dunno. Jacqui's always on about not getting out enough. Like I remember when Georgie was a nipper, I'd finish a hard day's yakka and wanna go down the pub. Phew. She'd say, "Well, I want to go, too." I'd say, "We both can't go, so you go down, honey. "Just you go down. I'll look after Georgie." She said, "But I want you to come with me." She can't be entirely dependent on me for her social life, can she? Ah, it seems to me marriage is some kind of lottery anyway. You buy your ticket... Hey, that reminds me, you owe me five bucks. Five bucks on the game. Come on. What are you? 13 points up. Okay, pal. You're on. Jeez. Too nice. Same again? -Why not? -Too-ka-doo. Manners? Yeah, that's right, Frank. I've got the manners of a pig. Eat shit. Thanks for the drink. Great piece of P.R. for the police force. No, he's all right. Just always thought you were screwing that bird of his. And now she hates the sight of a race car. -You can't really blame her. -Why? Oh, I saw that crash at the Grand Prix last year. That sort of thing used to happen every day in Europe. She followed me right round the circuit. All right, then. Take her back to Europe for a while. Back to Froggy Land? No way. I was only there for the racing. Better be hubcaps on there in the morning, lads. Nah, besides, I've got too much to do here. No... I can't figure it out. I just don't even know what to do about it. I'm not even sure I wanna do something about it. Oh, hell. Sorry, Ray. It's not your problem, I know. -Thanks for the game. -Sure. See ya. (GEORGIE) But Teddy always comes camping. -Come on, you two! -(JACQUI) We're coming. Come on. Hello, hello. What's he doing here? He's following me. No, Dad! (ENGINE CHOKES) (ENGINE STARTS) Al! I always wondered what'd happen... Al, stop it! Get going! What are you doing? (ENGINE SPLUTTERS) Al! (ENGINE STARTS) Okay, what's bothering you now? You know what's bothering me. Yeah, well, I'm not selling the yard. Well, I've had about as much as I can take. You've had about as much as you can take? How the hell do you think I feel? I've had a gutsful of your melodrama and constant criticism! God, woman, the last time I can remember doing anything right in your eyes was having a drink with the mayor. The bloody mayor, for Christ's sake! Whose conversation revolved around... Al, you're pushing me to the limit! I've had enough! ...big tits and clay shooting! -(AL) I've had a gutsful, too! -(JAC) Stop! Let me out! I've had enough! Stop it! (AL) Bag... (DOOR SLAMS) Knock, knock. Who's there? -Lydia. -Lydia who? Lydia dustbin! -Mommy, your bag. -Oh, thank you, darling. Come and give... Don't! Be a good girl, darling. (SNIFFLES) Hi. What's the matter? What do you wanna talk about? I don't know. I just had to talk to somebody. You probably realize things aren't great between Al and me. Mm. Look, I don't want to involve you. It's just that... Well, I thought I could talk to you. And you're a friend. (SIGHS) Yeah, but I'm also a friend of Al's. What do you think would happen to Al if I left him? I know the problems Liz and I had when we split up. I still haven't really got over it. We didn't have any kids. Just make sure it's what you really want. Do you want a beer? Where the hell did you put the tent? I put it in the truck. Well, I can't find it. -It must be in the front seat. -What? It must be in the front seat. We traveled in the front seat, didn't we? (SIGHS) It's not here. I told you to put everything tat was on the kitchen table in the back of the truck. When the hell are you gonna start getting things right? How can we go camping without a tent? Sorry, kiddo. Let's go home, eh? I wasn't in the mood for camping anyway. Go home and see your mom, eh? -I'll pick her some flowers. -Okay. Isn't that Al's truck? -I think it is. -What's he doing back? -Hello, Ray. -Al. -What's up? -Nothing. I was just... I asked him over. -See ya. -Bye. Uh... What's the story? (POTS CLATTERING, CLANKING) (AL) Jesus Christ! Where's the bloody frying pan? I can't find a frying pan anywhere. You can never find anything anywhere! Look at you! You leave glasses everywhere! -What do you think this is? -My home! (JACQUI) Look at us! Tell me, what... what am I gonna do here? (SIGHS) Why Ray? Why Ray? -Because... -Anybody else, but why Ray? I mean, he's my best bloody friend. Because he talks to me. He cares how I feel. You don't even talk to me anymore. What about? What the hell is there to talk about? That's right. Nothing. All you talk about is your bloody... Your past. Your hoity-toity ways in the bloody past! You shit on everyone around here, you supercilious bitch! What do you want? What do you want? It has nothing to do with Ray. Don't mention his name. -What do you want? -What do I want? -Tell me something you want. -I don't want to live in... Apart from fine clothes and bloody money! That's not important to me! You know that. I don't care about clothes! I just wanna be happy. What have I got here? Look at Georgie. She's growing up amongst dead cars! -She's growing up healthy. -Healthy? Dirty! Night and day, look at your hands! (AL) What's wrong with them? (JACQUI) I don't want her to be like everybody else in this town. Marrying the baker or some mechanic. I want her to have a better life. What's wrong with a mechanic? I don't like the way they smell. You want I should juggle for you, lady? -Dance for you? -(CHUCKLES) You can't even... Well, fuck ya! Don't you ever treat me like that, you brute! Leave those bloody cups alone! Leave them alone! (CUPS CLANKING) (JACQUI) They're just stupid memories, can't you see? You're a has-been! -You are! Don't! -Get out! (JACQUI SOBS) (AL) Jesus, woman. (SOBBING) Oh, I can't stand it any longer. (AL) Take it easy, will you? Okay, I'm sorry. (SOBBING) (PANTING) I'm leaving you, Al. It's not because of Ray. I just want to be on my own for a while. Be responsible for myself again. I'm going to go back teaching. I'm going to look after Margaret's house while she's away. Aren't you gonna say anything? -Have you got enough money? -I'll be all right. Well, if there is anything you want, just sing out, eh? Don't, Al. Georgie, see you on the weekend, honey. Remember you spend the weekends with me, eh? I've left some toys at the house, so I'll have something to play with. I wish Buick could come with me. No, no. It's better he stays with me. I'll, uh, drop you in a load of firewood. Look, stop being so nice, Al! Okay, then, I won't. (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO) (SIREN WAILS) (SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE) (CHUCKLES) (SIREN STOPS) Hi, Dad! What's the verdict? It's, uh... positive. Jesus, Tiny. I suppose you cocked up the other side, as well. Sure enough. God, Tiny, how many times have we done it? What's the matter, mate? Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I'm missing Georgie too much, that's all. Yeah, well, things are a bit hard for you right now. They're probably just as hard for Jacqui. (AL) Hmm. She's got a pretty funny way of showing it. Well, it's hard for her coming here. You being what you are. Talk about me a lot, do you? Why don't you find another woman? What for? Besides, the only lady I'm interested in happens to be seven years old. Oh! Non. (SPEAKS FRENCH) - Bonjour, mes enfants. - Bonjour. (JACQUI) Allez! (BOY) All right, Georgie! We've got to do some shopping on the way home. Ray's gonna come for dinner. Uh, we'll have something special, huh? How about chops? Uh, nah. Something... something special like deep-friend brains. -Yuck! -(CHUCKLES) Hi, Jac. Look, I know I've been totally unreasonable. I've made my mind up to sell the yard. Oh, how marvelous, Al. Yeah, well, I figure we could get half a million for it. We could go to America and buy a whole fleet of racing cars. No, no. I won't race myself. Hi, Jac. I know I've been totally unreasonable, but do you think I could come in and have a cup of tea, and we could talk about it? Oh, of course, Al. I know that I have been totally unreasonable. I know I've been totally unreasonable.' Hi, Jac. Look, I know I've been totally unreasonable.' Hi, Jac. Look, um... I know you've been totally unreasonable... I mean, I've been totally unreasonable, but... Look, Al, you can't be coming around here all the time. I've got some roller-skates for Georgie. No. She's in the middle of her dinner. Is it all right if I take her to Bay Park on the weekend? No. I'm racing the car for the first time. No, I don't want her to go. I've been building that car for a year. Georgie helped me make half of it. If you don't let her go now, she'll be broken-hearted. I'm scared you'll have an accident. It would be terrible for her. Well, I hope she likes the skates. Open the door! Jacqui, open the door or I'll bloody well smash it down! (JACQUI) Go away! I said open this door! If you don't go away, I'll call the police! (CHUCKLES) I'll call him for ya! Ray? Ray? What's the matter? Are you stuck under the bed? God, Foley. What do you want from my life? You've got my wife and my kid. Tell you what, I'll give you the shirt off my back. Here you are. She bought it. And these. Nice, tight, poncey jeans. I hope they cut your balls off. If you've got any, that is. Has he, Jacqui? And I'll tell you what, Ray, you'll love these. Clean on today. Christ! What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you want my boots, too? Or do you think they're too big for you? Get your bloody boots. Inside! Get some bloody clothes on! Get out! Come on! I'd give you my race car as well, but you wouldn't have the guts to drive it. Al... Remember, Georgie's still my kid. And I'm taking her to Bay Park on the weekend. (CHUCKLES) (BOTH CHUCKLING) (INDISTINCT COMMENTARY) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (AL) Righto. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (TV) 'There's the 60-second board....' Mom, Mom! Come quick! The race is starting! ...qualifying fastest in practice with a very, very quick time, and of course that turns him in pole position. Very shortly they'll be in the starter's hands as he moves to his platform, and raises the flag to start this big event. They're in the starter's hands. Not too far behind. He hasn't got it all his own way just yet. Up the short straight they go. Then back to another left-hander. This time taking it a little more steadily. Goes to the wide side of the circuit. Finds more traction. Leads the rest of the field down over the dips and towards the next left-hander. Al Shaw's still holding the lead, and of course he's the man who likes to make sure everything's a-okay. Looking up at the skies, we can see there could be a change in the weather. Some of those black clouds moving closer to the circuit, and if it does rain, that'll sort the men out from the boys. Al Shaw round the left-hander once again. Up the straight he goes, and look at the clouds. Just about to open up, I would think, any minute now. Al Shaw's still holding out the race at this stage with Carling, Watson and then we go back to Oliver. And the main thing is Al Shaw looks in his mirror and he can see that he has people behind him. He's still got to be working very hard to stay in that lead. Al Shaw. Now back to Watson in the RT4. Then it's Oliver. Shaw taking to the wide side of the circuit. Getting off into the rough, as he finds some more traction. Heads up to lead the field, past the start-finish line. Looking across the circuit now, you'll notice quite a bit of rain coming towards the circuit, and any minute now I think we're in for a real deluge. Nobody would've expected this with the beautiful fine weather we had at the start of the race. See the crowd now moving away, turning their back on the race. It's absolutely pouring down now. Across the fence to get any shelter they possibly can to see the rest of the event. You'll notice the cars now. Rooster tails coming off the back tires, as they tear down and round the left-hander. We can see someone there. Looks like Al Shaw's got his hand up.' -Keeps missing. -Right. All right. (INDISTINCT COMMENTARY) Shaw back out on to the circuit again. He stopped there for 25 seconds. We don't know exactly what the problem was. Al Shaw. You can see the water coming off the tires. Absolute treacherous conditions he's driving in. Watson now in the RT4, the brand-new leader. And he thinks he's got no problems. Although Shaw has in the past had victories in the wet. The new race leader Watson going down the back straight. He hasn't got too much pressure behind him as the gaps start to close on the people at the rear of the field. We can see one of the cars going off the circuit, getting a bit of oversteer.' Look at that mountain. Al Shaw, has he the ability to make it through the circuit? He's got a lot of cars to pass. Al Shaw will try his utmost to get his RT1 up through the traffic.' And Shaw made it through all that traffic. You can see now the final part of the race coming to an end. Only a few minutes to run. He comes round the last left-hander. Just clips the circuit on the outside, as he comes down. There's the checkered flag. Al Shaw to victory...' I think Dad's won. Mom! Mom! Dad's won! Dad! Dad! Hi, honey. Do you wanna come round...? Yeah. I've told your mother. It's okay. Hop in. I'll put your motor in. Thanks, Dad. Please, please. -Jacqui... -Just 10 minutes. -I've gotta get back to work. -Just quickly. Hm? No, and you've gotta get Georgie. Well, she can wait. I've been late before. No, look. Really... Bye-bye. I'm not going to go out to dinner with you, then. -Yes, you are. -Oh, no, I'm not. Hey, Ray? Have you got any chewing gum left? I don't want it all. I just want a bit. You have the rest. -(CHUCKLES) -Bye-bye. Bye. -Hey, Ray? -No! Look. You forgot something. What are you doing? Jacqui! (CHUCKLES) -(AL) Can you see the rabbit? -Yeah. Is it right in the middle of the crosshairs? -Yeah. -OK. Pull the trigger. -Did I get it? -Nah. Good. -(JACQUI) Alan? Alan? -Jacqui? -Georgie's missing. -They went out hunting. (GASPS) Thank God she's all right. Yeah. Al and Georgie went a while ago and picked up the rifle. Look, it's... It's my fault. Al asked me to ring and I forgot. (SIGHS) Look, Tiny, don't try and make excuses for him. He's had it a bit rough lately. If he thinks he's having a hard time... Oh, come on, Jacqui. Explain it to him. See, he can't believe that you and, uh... Well, you leaving... hasn't sunk in. Well, if it hasn't by now, it will. (SIGHS) Come and have a cup of tea. I've never been able to stand this place. It's like, uh... It's like a graveyard. All those car wrecks out there. Most of them have either killed or injured somebody. It used to give me the creeps living out here in the middle of nowhere. That's why I left. I couldn't stand it, Tiny. I tried to talk to Al about it, but... ...we never got anywhere. He won't even talk to the guy that's trying to buy this place. When we first came here, eight years ago, when Al's father died... ...it was just supposed to have been for a couple of months, to sell the place and wind up the business. Once we got here, Al seemed to settle in. He was quite happy to vegetate here for the rest of his life. I don't know why he didn't look after you better. I'd better run. See what happens when you sign for registered letters? "Notice for application for a non-molestation order." We'll see about that, Jacqueline Marie Shaw. (SIGHS) Jacqui? Al, I don't want to talk about it. Jacqui... Look, Al. I don't want to talk about it. -Jacqui, we've got to... -No, Al. Please. No. What's going on in that head of yours? Al, what else could I do? You can't just take Georgie whenever you want to without telling me. Are you gonna let me in, so we can talk quietly about this or not? No. (ENGINE STARTS) Alan! Alan, what are you doing? Alan! Alan! (SCREAMS) (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO) Oh, I'm really desperate. (MIDWIFE) Baby's head is being born now. Don't push, though. That's excellent. That's great. See baby's head? Baby's head's born, OK. -There we are. -(BABY CRIES) There's baby. (BABY CRIES) (RAY SIGHS) You're a silly bugger, Al. You're just gonna have to calm down, or you'll end up in serious trouble. Come on. Frank'll run you home. Tiny picked up the truck. Just take things easy for a while, eh? I'll talk to Jacqui. See if things can't be sorted out a bit better. Do you mind if I take you out of your way? Some kids have been throwing bottles in the swimming pool. Thought I'd check it out. -(BUMPING) -Poor bugger. Come on, let's get the bastard! (SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (AL) Bastard! Here you are, Al. Have a drink, Al. Alan, you can't make an idiot of the law and get away with it. (AL) You bastards! Al? You know that notice you got a couple of weeks back? They've had the hearing. Al, it's a non-molestation order. It means you're not to go near Jacqui, and you haven't got access to your kid. But that's the law, Al. You can't go near them unless she says so. You had your chance to be represented! You could've gone, too, and been represented at the court. You were given the proper notice! -You tell that gutless Foley... -Ray had nothing to do... She's my kid, and I'll do what I want with her! Now piss off! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -(GEORGIE) Hi, Tiny. -Hi, sport. Georgie, why don't you go outside and play, huh? I want to have a talk to you about Al. Ray told me what happened. Look, Ray had nothing to do with it, Tiny. I know he didn't. I think you and Ray should take it easy for a while. Tiny, that's none of your business. Well, what about that non-molestation order he's got? How do you expect him to take that after everything else? Well, what else could I do? He takes no notice, you know. Look, I don't seriously mean that he can't see Georgie anymore. Well, I think there's gonna be big trouble. (GUN COCKS) (EXHALES) -Where are you going to, Al? -Bush. Wait a minute and I'll come with you. No. You're too bloody slow. -When will you back? -Maybe bloody never. Georgie! My... Don't! Don't play around like that. If you can't eat with these chopsticks... (GUN COCKS) Georgie... grab Teddy and get in the truck. You better do as your father says. I don't want to go. Get into the truck. -Do as your father says. -Get into the truck! -I don't wanna go. -Move! (GASPS) What are you doing, Al? Get in! (TRUCK DOOR CLOSES) (RAY) Al! You stupid bugger! Stay there! Al! Stop it! Stop it! Daddy, please slow down. Please. Will I get into trouble for staying away from school? Where are we going, Dad? I'm scared. -(RAY) Tiny? -Hello! Tiny, it's Al. He's gone off his head. He's grabbed Georgie. He's got a gun. What? Have you any idea where they've gone? I haven't a clue. Muttered something about going bush. I knew something like this would happen. Nobody will ever find us here, will they, Dad? I hope not, Georgie. (GEORGIE) I think we should go home. Your call, Dad. Six hearts. Seven clubs. -Seven hearts. -Eight clubs. First up, eh? Why did you come to the house and point the gun at Mom? You wouldn't really have killed them, would you, Dad? Course not. (GROANS) It's your turn, Dad. (GROANS) (GROANS) It's your turn. -What's trumps? -Clubs. Right. Are we gonna stay in the bush forever? Why? Would you like to? No. I was just wondering cos it's my birthday tomorrow. Oh, shit! Have a look under the bottom side. Doesn't look like there's anybody in there. Okay. There's no sign of them! Nobody inside! (RAY) Keep looking! Come on. No point staying. Come on. (DOOR CLOSES, FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hi. Still no sign. We've double-checked the bush. They're not in the river. I don't reckon they were in that truck when it went off the cliff. Al's set this whole thing up. I'm sure he has. It's Georgie's birthday today. They'll be all right. Sure. What do you reckon about that? Can I blow them out? We gotta sing the song first. You gotta help me, eh? I'll feel a real drongo if I sing it on my own. -♪ Happy birthday to you -♪ Happy birthday to me -♪ Happy birthday to you -♪ Happy birthday to me -♪ Happy birthday, dear Georgia -♪ Happy birthday, dear Georgie -♪ Happy birthday to you -♪ Happy birthday to me -Hip-hip... -Hooray! -Hip-hip... -Hooray! -Hip-hip... -Hooray! Right. Oh... I'll never forget this birthday party, Dad. Neither will I. It's just like yours. You know what'll happen if I take you back? What? They won't let me see you again. Yes, they will, Dad. No, they won't. At least this way, we can have a few weeks in the bush together. Knock, knock. -Who's there? -Ivan. Ivan who? ♪ I have an everlasting love for you ♪ You know when you were born, you were like a little wrinkled monkey. A froggy. -I wanna go for a pee, Dad. -Off you go. That's the beauty of the bush, eh, Dad? You can have a pee anywhere you like. (AL CHUCKLES) Not there. (GEORGIE) Mom! Mommy! Mom! I want my Mommy! Mommy! Mom! Mommy! Mommy! -Georgie, what's the matter? -I don't feel very well. Christ, you're burning up, girl. I want to go home. I can't take you home now, Georgie. Please don't get sick. You'll stuff everything up. I want my mommy. (ENGINE SPLUTTERING) (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) I want some medicine. I've got a sick girl in the car. She's running a temperature. I need some medicine. -Move! -(GASPS) Look, I don't wanna hurt you. Just get me some pills for my kid, will you? Hurry! I've just seen Al's car at the chemist shop. He appears to be inside. (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO) Come on. I'm gonna have to take you with me. I can't. I've got a hair appointment at three o'clock. -Shut up. -(SOBS) -Shut up! -(SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) He's got the girl hostage. He's armed with a shotgun. Will follow. Over and out. (SIREN WAILING) (METAL CLANKING) Come on. Out. -Quickly, girl! -(SOBS) (AL) Keep going. Move! -(SOBBING) -Come on. Move. Move, girl. Round here. Look, will you shut up, please? Sit down. Sit down! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get you into this mess. It's just I don't know what the hell I'm doing. You hold Georgie. Now, how many of these pills does she have? Just two. Here. You do it. Georgie, put them in your mouth and swallow them. I think I feel better now. Georgie, do as I say. Are we gonna die? (SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE) Al's over in the hubcap room. Jacqui... -(RAY) Have you talked to him? -Here... Al? Al, you've got to let Georgie and Rose go. Jacqui! Jacqui! Jacqui! Where's Jacqui? If Jacqui's out there, tell her I wanna talk to her! Al, she's not here. -(AL) Jacqui! -(MUTTERS) Jacqui! Jacqui! Don't be a fool! -Let me go! Let me go! -Jacqui! -(GEORGIE) Mommy! -Georgie. Thank you, Jac, for coming. You better take Georgie, eh? She's sick. I don't feel very well, Mom. Al, please give yourself up. You can't get away. Oh, Al, you stupid bastard. You've gone too far. We could get things going again, Al. I know we could. Just... you and Georgie and me. We could live together again. You could sell the yard, and we'd go away to Australia. Nobody would know us there. Al, if you give yourself up now, they'll be easy on you. I know they will. I'll stick by you, Al. I still love you. What's gonna happen, Dad? Your dad'll think of something. Go on. Take her away. What about Rose? Tell Ray Foley to get himself in here. With a bottle of whiskey. Then I'll see Rose out. Hey, Jac? J'aime tes jambes. He says that if you bring him a bottle of whiskey, he'll let Rose go. It's not full. Upstairs. Come on. Move. Al? Al? (CREAKING) Al, are you up there? Jesus. Where'd you learn that? I saw it on the news. Okay, girly. Off you go. You've got five minutes. -What? -Your hair appointment. (SOBBING) Okay, we'd better tighten that noose. Okay, down we go. Got a surprise for you. One. Two. Three. Four. Five and a half. Six. Seven. Tiny. That's right, Ray. Your car's ready. We've done a lot of work on her. I think we should take it for a test drive. Don't you? It's looking real pretty. Come on. Hop in. No, no. Sit up there, where everybody can see you. Now, Ray, the ignition. Press in, turn right. Starter button, up here with your foot. (ENGINE STARTS) (OFFICER) Don't move that car an inch further! (AL LAUGHS) Now, stop! Stop right where you are! (AL GUFFAWS) Is he talking to me? (OFFICER) Hold your fire! Keep back! Keep up! Don't wanna drink with me? Come on, Ray. What do you reckon? Any good or rotten? Keep cover, will you? Jesus, Ray. None of this would've happened if you hadn't moved in with Jacqui. You've got it totally cocked up, Al. I never moved in with Jacqui. You're a fuckwit, Ray. I'm a fuckwit! (SIGHS HEAVILY) As I see it, Georgie'd be a hell of a lot better off without both of us around. Up there! And stop that bloody train! You! (TRAIN HORN BLARES) You didn't really expect me to let that happen, did you? (GUN CLICKS) You fucking bastard. I mean, a beautiful car like this?
