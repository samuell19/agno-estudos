SNOWWHITE Once upon a time in winter, snowflakes fell like feathers from heaven. A queen sat by her window sewing. The window frame was made of dark ebony. As she sewed and watched the snow, a needle pricked her finger. Three drops of blood fell on the snow, making her think, I wish for a child as white as snow, with lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony. Soon after she had a girl. She was as white as snow, red as blood, and black as ebony. So she was called Snow White. Soon after the baby was born, the queen died. A year later, the king took another bride. She was very beautiful, but vain and haughty. She could not bear the idea of anyone being fairer than she. She kept a wonderful mirror. Every day she would look in it and ask: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who is the fairest of them all? The mirror replied: You, oh queen, are the fairest of all. That satisfied her. She knew the mirror told the truth. But Snow White grew more beautiful with age. Guard, what?s up? Guests arriving, Snow White. The king from the kingdom next door. Stop! Where are you going? The queen does not want guests to see you. Obey her, and disappear! How many more fanfares? How many guests did the queen invite? I don't know how I'll manage! Go on! Get to work! Go on! To work! Go on! Go! She?s feasted every day since Snow White?s father died. We might get a new king! Mind your own business. I?ll wipe the gravy off your nose. -Wait! Get out of there! -Where is the wine? The queen wants full jugs to toast her convivials. Hurry up! Hey, cook! -What are you doing? -Checking if the wine is leaking. If it's leaking? -Hurry up! -Just you wait! She wants to toast her... convivials! Welcome to you all. Welcome to my kingdom! You have traveled far. Please be seated. -Where is the toasting wine? -it's here, my queen. To the queen! To the queen?s beauty! -To the queen?s beauty! -Chin-chin! I need 100 hands! -Snow White! -Can I help? What are you doing in the kitchen? The queen banned me from the banquet hall. Banned? it's your birthday. Nobody knows. -I know. -Me too. -And me. -We all do. Thank you. Thank you all. Quick! Quick! Quick! -Quick! The fish! The roast! -Okay, okay, okay! it's all ready. Wait a minute. -I can't carry all that. -I?ll help you. Go ahead! Right, Snow White! The queen will burst with anger. -Who are you? -Snow White. Why aren't you at the banquet? The queen will never forgive you. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who is the fairest of them all? Queen, though you are fair, it's true Snow White?s fairer by far than you. Snow White! Fairer than me! The young king wants to speak to you. Forgive me, fair queen! -You have come for forgiveness? -Yes. I leapt up from your table because I saw Snow White. I beg you, give me her hand in marriage. -You want Snow White?s hand? -Yes. Very well. You can have her. But only if you can find her. Make her your wife! -Get the huntsman. -Who? The huntsman! Go! He wants her as his wife. Snow White must die! No whys, no wherefores. These are your orders. Take Snow White into the forest. Deep into the forest. And kill her. -Kill her? -Yes, kill her. -What are you waiting for? -My queen! That's a terrible, inhuman order. Snow White is too young. -Yes. And beautiful. -Beloved. -In the palace and all the land. -Snow White must die! No questions! Follow orders! -I?ll obey. -Bring proof. Proof that she is dead. Bring Snow White?s heart. The king only has eyes for Snow White and has forgotten the queen! What did I say? The queen?s bursting with anger. Where is Snow White? I beg you to tell me where she is. Where is Snow White? She's no longer in the palace. Even if I knew, I could not say more. Tell your vain, haughty queen I?ll find her. I won't rest until I do. Snow White, we stay here. Why so far? There?s no road for miles. I?d never find my way out. The queen has ordered me to kill you. -Kill me, huntsman? -Right. In the forest. I must take her your heart. -You can't be so cruel. -The queen is cruel. You must die because you are fairer than she. But I shall kill a wild animal. I?ll take its heart to the queen. She will believe you are dead. Thank you, huntsman. Run along, Snow White. don't be afraid. don't worry. Do you hear that? I?m not alone here. Hello!
