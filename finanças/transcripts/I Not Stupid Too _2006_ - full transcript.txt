When was the last time you praised someone? When was the last time someone praised you? lt?s been a while, isn?t it? l?m Jerry. l?m 8 this year. l?m not stupid. l scored Band 1 for all my subjects, but Mum and Dad hardly praise me. lnstead, they chide me for not scoring higher marks. Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize goes to. . . Tom Yeo of Singapore High. Tom Yeo, Tom Yeo, Tom Yeo. . . This is my brother, Tom. That?s right. We?re Tom & Jerry. He?s a prolific blogger. But look at Mum, she?s obviously not appreciative of his talent. Tom Yeo, Tom Yeo, Tom Yeo. . . Bro, you?re an awesome blogger. ??Awesome blogger??? Writing nonsense is ??awesome??? Why not impress me with your essays? Bro scored 65 for his Chinese essay. ls 65 marks a good grade? l used to score 85 marks. How many Tang Poems can you recite? l?m the editor of a Chinese magazine yet your Mandarin is so bad. lt?s such a disgrace. l?m back. Yeah. Finished your homework? Yes. How was your test today? Right. Time to shower. Why haven?t you showered?! Go take your shower!! Don?t you understand what l?m saying? TAKE YOUR SHOWER! OK. . .! lt?s my maid. . . What maid?! Ma. . .mermaid!! Mermaid. . . This is Bro Chengcai and his Dad. All grown-ups are alike. They dislike what we like. They like what we dislike. Sometimes this really eats us. Where are you going? Why are you practicing kung fu? You want to be Bruce Lee? He?s dead. How dare you talk back? l once thought l was a good fighter and that cost me my leg. Can?t you learn from my mistake? Give it back to me! Don?t touch! Don?t touch my stuff! Hey! Hey! Let go! Grown-ups think that by telling us alot, they are communicating. Actually, they are running their own shows. We pretend to listen. But their words. . . evaporate instantaneously. They don?t care if we really heard, so long as they?ve said their piece. Understand? Stop there! Listen to me. . . Just watch Granny jabber on and on. l doubt they know their nagging can kill. Grown-ups blabber too much. Don?t they understand the meaning of overloading? Sometimes, we really wish to be heard. How dare you rebut? Trying to be smart? lt?s for your own good. How dare you? We are doing this to save you from extra trouble. l?ve said so much. Do you understand? Why are you so quiet? Are you dumb? We get told off for everything we say, gradually, we learned to shut up. Have you finished your Chinese homework? Lame shit! l spent all night ok! Bro Chengcai yearns to be a good child, just like everyone else. So for the first time in a long while, he did his homework. Those who did not do my homework, please leave the classroom. So you finally did your homework. But it was a load of rubbish. lt?s as good as not doing it. Hey! This is not a coffee shop. Picking a fight? You want to hit me? l?m not afraid of threats! Waste my time! Others call you hopeless ??rotten apples??. Can?t you prove them wrong? l?m warning you, stop your crap about ??rotten apples??. lf we were ??rotten apples??, as our teacher, wouldn?t you be responsible? That?s correct. A father is responsible for not teaching his son. A teacher is lazy if his student misbehaves. You get out too! Both of you get out! Who asked you to go out? l did the homework on your account. And yet l?m punished for it. Everything we Normal Tech students do can only be bad. Everything the Express students do is good. Alas! Our poor fates! Yeah! Class. Regardless if you?ve improved from 25 to 30, or 35 to 40 marks, any improvement is commendable. And l will reward these students with a Jay Chou?s CD. Hey! Wish we were in that class. We are so unlucky. The grass is greener on the other side. l believe you?d do even better next time. Why do some grown ups sound more pleasing to the ears. Today?s paper is so difficult. Yeah! l hate Chinese! Luckily, Mr Fu didn?t scold me for scoring 10 marks. Jingjing! l did not reprimand you just now. You only scored 10 marks? You?re really modest, aren?t you? Well, it?s a perfect 10. Perfect 10? You don?t even speak Mandarin with me. How can your Mandarin improve? l tried my best. Tried your best? No excuses. Don?t you realize? Chinese is getting more important nowadays. ls Chinese so important? Our principal doesn?t speak it yet she can become a principal. So what if l fail Chinese? Excuses, excuses! Those who keep finding excuses will never improve. This Saturday, all of you must come for remedial lessons. l?ll teach you until you learn. Nowadays, kids are hard to coach. They have shut us out. Shut us out? You need a key. Key? Focus on their talents and not their flaws. This is the key. With this key, you can communicate. She only scored 10 marks! What kind of talent is this? Listen. . . l?m dead-beat, let?s talk another day. Mr Fu! Keys are very important. The performance is on 31st August. Please invite your parents and reply me tomorrow, ok? Yes. After the auditions, we?ve decided. Jerry will be the lead narrator. Xiaoxi will be the honey bee. Tommy Leung will be the sunflower. Hey! You?re the leading actor! Zeng Feishun will be the strawberry. Can you concentrate on your studies? Performances are a waste of time. Now, pair up with the opposite sex and form a circle. Now, face each other again. . . Mrs Leow. Ms Tan. . . What are you doing? Stand in line! Are you ready? What are you laughing at? Pay attention! Hey! Do you hear me? Turn and 3. . .4. . .5. . .6. . .7. . .8. . . Well done, take a break. Next group! Slowly. Line up. You stand here. Remember what l taught yesterday? Yes? Good, let?s take it from the top. 1 . . .2. . .3. . .4. . .5. . .6. . .7. . .8. . . 2. . .2. . .3. . .4. . .5. . .6. . .7. . .8. . . 3. . .2. . .3. . .4. . .5. . .6. . .7. . .8. . . What are you up to? Sorry, l?m not available now. Leave me a message after the ??beep?? tone. l?ll return your call as soon as possible. Although both my parents are alive, l feel no different from an orphan. My brother doesn?t like me, so l have to solve my own problems. Why are you using my pen and paper? Please, Bro. . . This is how my parents and l communicate. Can you attend my concert on 31st August? - Jerry Need $20 to buy textbook. - Tom My editor works me overtime, daily. till l have no time for myself. Me too, l have presentations everyday. l?m burnt out. l?ll go check on the kids. Pour me a glass of water. lt?s New Year, my parents gave me a red packet. New Year?s over, l spent all the money. Do you. . . Jerry, you?re in trouble. Congratulations! You?re going to be a father. Did you watch TV last night? Yes. That woman was pregnant with that man?s baby, right? Yes. Do you remember what they did? Yes, they held hands and kissed, then. . . they slept together and her tummy grew big. You and Xiaoxi did all that yesterday. That?s how they got pregnant? Of course! Liars! Hey! We?re good friends. We?re telling you this out of goodwill. So much for trying to be nice. lt?s New Year, my parents gave me a red packet. New year?s over, l spent all the money. Jerry, are you sure l?m having a baby? Affirmative. Serious? Yes, because. . . what is shown on TV is always true. What is shown on TV must be the truth. Don?t worry, l?ll bear the responsibility. Meaning? l don?t know either, because. . . that?s how it always goes on TV. Hey! Let?s go! l found a really cool website. There?s everything in there. Check out the ??My Copyright?? card that l designed. Check out this ??deceased??. . . l mean. . . ??deserving?? picture. Granny, where do babies come from? Baby? Picked from the rubbish dump. Laksa soup? You?ll know when you grow up. Yati, where do babies come from? Rubbish dump! Rubbish dump? Jerry, there?s no need to teach you, lt?ll come to you naturally. Why is that. . . uncle pushing the auntie? Turn it off!! Turn it off!! l only want to ask you, where do babies come from? Mum, where did l come from? - Jerry Jerry, you?d find out when you grow up. - Mum You?re really not having me on? We?re good pals, why should we lie? That?s right! Mrs Leow. Waiting for your maid, Jerry? Oh. . .are your parents coming to the concert? Mrs Leow, can you give me more time? l haven?t got the chance to speak with them. Are you that busy? You have no time to ask them? You must be quick, or there won?t be any tickets left, bye. Mrs Leow, can l ask you a question? Sure. How did you get pregnant? lt?s because Dad?s ??worm?? met Mum?s egg and became a baby, then the baby grew in Mummy?s tummy. You mean your Dad?s ??worm??? No. Who put the ??worm?? inside? How did the ??worm?? get inside? You?ll learn this next year. Goodbye. Goodbye. Yes? ls your tummy also the result of the ??worm?? and the egg? Not only that, it includes pork, chicken, beef, mutton, fried noodles, cakes, chocolates. . . and many bottles of soft drinks everyday. Miss, which shaver is better? Both are just as good. Both shave well. Great, wrap this up. Can l pay by card? Sure. Pay by card. . . so cool! You have money? l only have enough to buy this shaver. Yati, open this can. Today?s Father?s Day, l?ll teach you how to cook abalone. You can cook for Sir next time. Where?re your presents? To Dad: Happy Father?s Day! This is nice! What is it? Who is this? You! Me? Why is your Dad. . . all black? Will you stand there, Dad? What for? Just do it, just for a while. . . What are you up to? Well, ok! See. . . This is how Dad looks every night. Turn on the light! lf only you?re half as good in your studies as you are at these nonsense. This happens when you don?t have time for them. Speak for yourself. Jerry, what else are you good at? Show me! l can tell stories! Good! Tell me one. Everyone has a dream. With dreams, comes hope. Why buy another one? What a waste of money. l bought it with my own money. Your own money? We gave you the money. What a waste! Anyway l could use a new shaver. . . Are you that busy? No calls during mealtimes! lt?s not healthy. Correct! But l. . . l can be excused. Right! lt could be a million-dollar contract. You can?t find the chicken rice stall? Serious? lt?s beside the Rojak stall! There are 2 stalls. The Kueh Tutu is good too. l?ll give you the full address. This call is more important than you think. lf his client doesn?t get to eat Chicken rice, Rojak or Kueh Tutu and they get pissed off, the deal is off. Mine may not be a million-dollar contract, but people call me for important matters. 50 percent? Discount? That skirt? l?ve been waiting it! Time to eat! Mum! Come and eat. . . Hello! What shall we do about my tummy? l don?t want a baby. l don?t want to become fat like her. Sit here! The pineapple?s sweet, want some? No way, no pineapples for me. Right, no pineapples for pregnant women. You may get a miscarriage. Touch Wood! l can?t eat anymore. l?ll help you eat some. l?m not pregnant, why should l eat? You should eat. My tummy hurts. Just 2 more pieces. l don?t want. My tummy hurts. lt?s very painful. . . She ate a lot of pineapples. The baby is coming out. Girl, tell me who bullied you? Don?t cry, it?s all right. We?re here to help you. You can tell me what happened. Tell me who bullied her? No one bullied her. Her baby? lt?s mine. Thank you. Sorry for the trouble. No problem. Are you sure he didn?t bully you? Really? Phew! l thought l was a Great Granny. Abortion by pineapples is an old wives? tale. lf only l could talk to my parents, and learn the truth about pregnancy l?d not have made a fool of myself. You?re getting out of hand. You?re really getting naughtier. You spent all your savings on pineapples, made her eat and brought her to the clinic? You?ve been a bad boy! l couldn?t find you. . . You still dare to rebut? How do you want to be punished? Speak! Stop scolding! He?s just a kid. Mum, stay out of this. l?m teaching my son. Teaching? You?re just scolding him! lt?s sensible of him to think of pineapples, and to bring her to the clinic. As parents you must look at his merits, don?t just look at his mistakes. He didn?t tell us his whereabouts. He bought and made her eat pineapples. What merit is there? Mum, l?m teaching my son. Can you just stay out of this? Fine! You?re always right. Come! Let?s go up! Wait! l?m not finished with you! Go face the wall! Go! How can l make you understand? lt?s all your fault! Pardon me? My fault? And you?re not responsible at all? Even if l am, l have lesser faults! Fine! What did l do wrong? You took up the magazine job and worked overtime every night. You have no time to teach the kids! Teaching the kids is our responsibility. lf the kid makes a mistake, then it?s both our fault. l work my ass off. l put bread on the table, am l wrong? Ever since we got married, you never cared about me. Now something goes wrong and l?m solely responsible? Alright! lt?s all my fault! You are not at fault! You?re not responsible at all! ls that better for you? Ask yourself. Since we were married, have you ever spared a thought for me? l?m an eyesore now, isn?t it? Are you keeping a mistress? Are you crazy? Calling me crazy? You?ve never treated me like this before! Not again. . . can you be more creative? Don?t peep! You?re such a pain in the ass! l?m a pain in the ass? l want a divorce. . . You think l?m a pain in the ass? l want a divorce. . . You think l?m a pain in the ass?! l want a divorce. . . l want a divorce. . . l want a divorce! Standard line, it never changes. My money! Please do not disturb. lt?s been a week. Mum and Dad are still at it. They call this the ??cold war??. ln times of war people in the war zone suffer the worst. Jerry, tell your Dad Granny and Yati are out today, he has to clean up after his meal. Dad?s here, why don?t you tell him yourself? Just do as l say! Dad, Mum asks you to. . . Do what? Clean up after the meal! Clean up after the meal. Tell her l bought disposable plates, disposable cups and table cloth. l?ll throw everything away after eating! She can rest her mind! Tell her! Go on! Tell her! Are you dumb? Your brother?s dumb, are you dumb too? Someone?s deaf, are you mute or dumb? Busy? What took you so long? My parents are quarrelling everyday. l won $5, come out for a drink. l?m bored, but l?ve nothing to do at home. Hello,Someone knocked me and didn?t apologise. Come and bash him up? l can?t take it, come now. . . bye! Chengcai, someone?s following me! Come quick!! l?m at block 58! Come now! Attack my friend? l dare you to strike me! Come! Go to hell! Fat ass! Help! Help! Your son fought with some hooligans. Accordingly, he shall be penalized. Rascal! All you do is fight! Mr Lim, you?re in a school. Violent families breed violent children. Violent. Actually, parents are the role models. You must. . . Parents are the children?s role models. Yes, if you don?t make yourself an exe. . . Exe. . . what?s the word? Exemplar. Exemplar. The kids will follow ??suite??, it is to follow ??suit??. Excuse me, l?m learning the language. lt?s difficult, but l must persevere. People say: ??You?re not finished if you lose, but you?re finished if you quit!?? Please excuse my poor language. When students make mistakes, we have to take disciplinary action accordingly. l hope you won?t. . .won?t Just don?t do it again. Nowadays, kids value their friends? opinion more than their parents? advice. When we speak, everything we say bores them. Learn their lingo, like the word ??lame??. Communicating with your kid is an art. Why are you dolling up? l?m meeting my son?s teacher to discuss his talent. What talent? He?s fat! Being fat is a talent? Gosh! He?s formidable! He?s the national short-putter champion! He threw my things around since young. He threw your stuff downstairs? No, he threw them upstairs. Never thought that throwing can be a talent too. Doesn?t your son like to fight? Fighting is a talent too. Fighting? Train him. He may be an international champion one day. With the mafia or the triads? What?s wrong with you? You?re really frigid! Can?t you say anything good about others? Tell me. When was the last time you praised your son? Two years ago? When he was two years old. Oh! Good gracious! Your son had it tough. Tan, the lime tea yesterday was really good. Make it better and l will put it on the menu. Work harder! His drinks taste awful. See? This is exactly your problem. Why is it so hard to give praises? Learn from the Caucasians, shower praises. . . Excellent! Great! Well done! Marvellous! Mummy. You?re back from school? l scored 65 in my Math test. Baby, since you started tuition, you?ve become smarter. Very good! l love you! Time to take your lunch! Have you ever said ??l love you?? to your son? Don?t underestimate the power of these 3 words. That?s very smart of you! This is the most difficult angle. Wow! Perfect! This is the last one for this colour. How much is this? $ 120. Can you give me a discount? How much? $20. Discount of $20? No, sell it to me at $20. This is free. Here. . . This is $20. You think you?re very heroic? We are called up by the Principal because of this. You are such a disgrace. l?m really disappointed in you. lt?s time for tuition. l want to buy ??Pokemon?? cards, Mum. No way! Sit down and finish your homework. All my friends have them, so must l. Says who? Get down to work! lf you behave yourself, l can buy you anything, even the moon! Dad, if you really buy the moon, we can?t keep it in here. Are you trying to be smart? Want a beating? Mum, how do l solve this? Ask the Math expert, l teach Chinese. Here, finish this 2004 exam paper. l?ll check after my shower. No cheating. Here! Dad, how do l solve this? lt?s simple. Just deduct 270? from 360? and add 32?. Deduct 32? from 360? and add 270?. . . 598?. l?ve tried. . . right. . . Could it be a virus attack? lt?s infected by a virus? l don?t know. . . lt happens all the time. This virus is very destructive. Hang on. Why are you playing with ??Pokemon?? cards? Why aren?t you concentrating? l?ve finished. l was waiting for you. Waiting? Why didn?t you say so? l?ll call you later. Come! Can?t you put in more effort? Deducting 32? from 360? then adding 270? gives 500 plus degrees. ls there an angle that is more than 500?? You?re asking for a beating? Pay attention. Stop playing with these ??Pokemon?? cards. This is so infuriating! Can?t you focus more? Hello? Right, it?s $500 per hour for my talk. Right. $500 and l?ll give you 1 hour. Yes. Sure, please arrange with my secretary. Thank you, great! Heard that? They?re paying $500 to hear me talk for 1 hour. l haven?t prepared for my talk tomorrow, yet l came back to tuition you both. But you give me poor attitude. And you?re still playing with your ??Pokemon?? cards. You?d be the death of me! Now, focus! Hello. Ms Tan, can you help me. . . Bro, can l borrow money to buy ??Pokemon?? cards? Start your own savings, then you can buy anything you want. Son. . . l love you. l?m learning English. This bag cost me more than $20. lt?s for you. l don?t want it. Why not? lt?s so ugly! There are two sides to everything. You should look at its worth and not look at its flaws. What?s its worth? lt?s worth. . . lt?s worth. . . lt?s brand new. That?s it? And. . . the cartoon is very cute. l?ll use my old bag. Your bag? Your bag is worse! lt?s a stinking piece of junk that nobody wants. Hey! Don?t touch my stuff! Wow! 91 marks? Only 16 marks?! Damn it! You scored 16 out of 100? Why are you so modest? Fancy giving discounts in the exam. How can you score so badly? l just don?t know, old man! What can l do? How can you be so rude? l learnt it from you! Why can?t you learn my virtues? What virtues? You?re just a lame ex-convict! Stop! Don?t come back! Don?t you ever come back again! Tom, quick. You?re late. What? No slides? l thought l had a backup copy. What to do? The client will be here in 30 mins. How can you be so careless and irresponsible? l?ll hold you responsible, lf we lose this client Yes?! Oh. . . oh hello. Mr Lim, how are you? Regarding the presentation. . . What?s the matter? l fixed it, Dad. You fixed it? You must have spoilt it, right? You?re making it up to me now. l?ve told you not to touch my things. You?re incorrigible. Why aren?t you in school? l. . . What? You skipped school again? School?s more important! Go now! Boss, the laptop?s fixed. Jingjing. Complete this Chinese idiom for me. . . ??The monks are many. . .?? What follows? The nuns are lesser. What?s so funny? l?m not amused at all. lt?s pathetic! You don?t even know this simple idiom! You?ve studied the language since primary school. What have you learned? The complete idiom should be : ??The monks are many, the gruel meagre??. Understand? No. Use the dictionary! We don?t know how to. lt?s all in Chinese, how do we check? Sir, what is ??gruel??? You?re beyond hope. ??Gruel?? is ??porridge??. So what is ??porridge??? ??Porridge?? is rice grains cooked in plenty of water. lf you cook rice grains with less water, what do you get? A burnt pot! What is that in English? l know! l know! l know! lt?s??Chao-da?? . Can you explain all these in English? We are in a Mandarin class. When l studied English in school, my teacher never explained in Mandarin. Do you know why they?re not interested to learn Chinese? You really want to know? Yes! They said you don?t know Chinese but you?re still a Principal, so Chinese couldn?t be that important. Ok, l know l?m weak in Chinese. That?s because l studied Malay. But, l am willing to learn. And you?ve got to help me. Many students speak only English at home. lf you can explain in English, they will understand better. During my school days, my teacher didn?t explain in Mandarin. During your school days, policemen wore shorts. Now policemen in Pulau Ubin don shorts too. Mr Fu, we must be forward thinking. lt?s a different generation. As the saying goes ??a thousand years has passed??. . . lt?s ??times have changed??. What? ??Times have changed??. How many thousand years is that? lt is not explained this way. . . Whatever. . . Stop using passe teaching methods. lt?s not going to help the students. We used wrong methods in the past, that?s why many people suffered. Now they realized their mistake, so should you. You?re a dedicated teacher. You even bought them dictionaries. But it?s all in Chinese. They still wouldn?t understand. lf they?re not interested in using it, the dictionary is deemed useless. l intend to impart fishing methods and not spoon feed them with the fish. Mr Fu, don?t change the subject. l?m talking about Chinese, not fishing. Please scan. What do you want? BBQ Pork rice. BBQ Pork rice. There. . . ok. Remember to top up your card. You shouldn?t be eating this, allow me. This is not healthy, l?ll eat it. Why aren?t you eating today? l?m saving up. For what? Goodness gracious! Hey! My BBQ pork! This is pork. Pork makes you stupid, l?ll eat it for you. Kaihua, do you want to buy cards? l have Delta EX, HP160, upgradable by 200 points. How much? lt?s very cheap, $30. l?ll throw in Recorder EX plus 3 pages of Chinese homework for you. 5 pages! Ok, it?s a deal! Jerry, are you going to buy new ??Pokemon?? cards? Your tickets. . . and yours. Jerry, are your parents coming? What?s so difficult about asking them? Do it soon, ok? l?m running out of tickets. Mum, are you free on 31st August? Can you attend my concert with Dad? Don?t ask me, ask your Dad. Dad, are you free on 31st August? Can you attend my concert with Mum? Don?t ask me, ask your Mum. Dad doesn?t like to concede defeat. lt?s impossible to make him bow. Likewise for Mum. They say, when adults engaged in a cold war, whoever apologizes first, loses the war. l don?t get it. Grown-ups force us to say sorry but they themselves can?t do it. Sorry, l love you! Sorry!!! l love you!! Want to hitch a ride? ls it along the way? Of course! We?re leaving! Yati, may l borrow your phone? Will you attend my performance on 31st August? Sorry, l can?t promise yet. l may be overseas at work. They?re conducting spot checks for mobile phones! Who brought mobile phones to school? Mr Fu, check them thoroughly. l?m sure they brought their mobile phones. Don?t try to cover up for them. Surrender your mobile phones. l may give you a chance. Sir, we are impoverished students. How can we afford mobile phones? Be Quiet! Stand up, put your bags on the table. We have insider information. These students bring mobile phones to school everyday. You can?t trick me. Surrender it. l didn?t bring it. Surrender it! l didn?t bring it. There?s no use hiding it. What an expensive model. l don?t have one. . . really! l swear l don?t have one! 9 6. . . Alright. . . wait. . . Here. l don?t have one. You?re wasting my time. l really don?t have one! Alright. Here is it. Hey! Stop kicking! l said stop! Oh Shit! You?re a bunch of outlaws. How can you bring these here? Mr Fu, stop kicking up a fuss. Don?t tell me you?ve never watched one before? l dare you to say that again? l mean, teachers are humans too. Maybe teachers hold private screenings. Who knows? Why? l hit the jackpot? You?re beyond hope! Break it up! Stop fighting! This is very serious. l have no choice but to take action. For Tom, l?ll conduct a public caning. As for Chengcai. . . He has a bad record and is incorrigible. l?d have to. . . expel him. Principal, l?m still alive. Principal, l?m alive too. l can cane my own son if he did wrong. l?ve given up on caning my son. What right have you to cane my son? Why don?t you cane my son? Please don?t expel him. lf you cane him, can he turn good? lf he can turn good, you can cane him. lt?s up to you. Just don?t expel him. Why do you keep disagreeing with me? You. . . Alright. Alright. l have a win-win solution. Let?s swap the scenario. You cane his son, and expel. . . Are you nuts? Enough! There are some things that l really dread to do, as a principal. But rules are rules. l have to abide by the rules. l?m sorry. Please give us a chance! Principal, why don?t l donate $20,000? Will this resolve the issue? Principal, l can sweep the school grounds! We?ll donate air conditioners! Or computers. . . Principal, l can wash the toilets! Get up! Are you happy? You?re expelled. You?re really something, eh? What do you want me to do? How do l make you more sensible? What are you staring at? What are you staring at? Get up!! l said get up!! Get up! Get up! Stop! When will you stop beating me? l?m already 15 years old! Students. This is Tom Yeo from Class 4G. He committed a serious offence. He possessed a pornographic video disc and attacked a teacher. He?ll be punished accordingly. Disciplinary master, please proceed! ??Lonely Boy?? ??Tom Yeo died today!?? News of a teacher striking a student led to heated debates across the country. Everyone?s discussing it. Physical discipline and bruises are just small matters. This matter reflects our teachers? temperaments which is far more significant. Our children spend most of their time in school. lf violence is encouraged in our schools, how different are schools from triads? We have no time to discipline our children, so we depend on the teachers. So long as the kids are not beaten to death, the teachers are just doing their jobs. Why should the teachers be blamed? We?re now outside the school to interview some students. Can you give a comment on the incident? Stop! Don?t! Don?t film me! lt?s very sensitive! Just some comments? Don?t implicate me! Recognize me? Even your mother won?t recognize you now. Great! As you know, this is a very sensitive issue. My principal may blacklist me. Let me state my point, students have human rights too! How can the teachers hit us? They are violating... violating. . . our human rights! Even my parents don?t beat me like that. What right do teachers have? How could they?! How could they?! The public caning of the student who attacked his teacher, has sparked off a fresh round of debate over the issue of public caning. The matter has blown out of proportions. What do you think of the school?s decision? Singapore is a civilized society. This barbaric act is beyond my comprehension. You wouldn?t understand just how naughty these students can be. Teachers are not allowed to cane the students. lf l, as the principal cannot conduct corporal punishment, l don?t know how we can teach our students. As long as the child is caned, it doesn?t matter where it?s conducted. Why must they be caned in public? Caning is not about the pain. lt?s about the shame. We cane these students in public and shame them in front of their friends, Next time they commit this offence they will think twice. Also, it serves as a strong warning to the others. With one stone, l can kill two birds. Of course, this is not the best solution. Even convicts are not caned in public. We consider their feelings. Why can?t we consider for our children? We follow the Ministry of Education?s guidelines. The ministry allows the principal to conduct this punishment. They must have their reasons. l am in no position to comment. How are they to face public scrutiny? After caning, we continue to counsel the child. Counseling them is important, but we must also counsel those around them. l won?t be able to face my friends. Not to look at those punished with a biased perception. So embarrassing. l?ll be very scared. When l was a student, l was caned by my principal. l wasn?t scared, l?ll do it again. After that, l became a good boy. lf the school is unable to counsel the people around them, they should have no right to cane the student in public. Caning is the best solution. Might as well kill me. l will think twice next time. lf we behave ourselves, we don?t have to worry. My mother and the school cane me. The prison canes my father. So what? This is training from young. Sorry, l really have to go. Last question. . . Karen, your magazine is the best-seller in Singapore! My son is getting out of hand. Letter of resignation To: The Principal Mr Fu! Mr Fu! Mr Fu! Mr Fu! Mr Fu, don?t be hard on yourself. Although you are partly responsible, we know you?re a dedicated teacher. You are hardworking and responsible. To help your students improve, you forked out money to buy them dictionaries. We are all aware of this. Right, Mr Fu!
