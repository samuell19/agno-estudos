I'm listening. (dramatic music) - [Mouse] Sugar saves lives. Hell, Sugar saved my life. People are so confused what it is, but as it becomes more known, everybody wanted their hands on this mysterious drug, Sugar. Once the word got out there about Sugar, even the top drug gangs wanted in. The Dynasty, an all female drug gang, that was led by Naomi? They even wanted a piece of the action. The one thing Cal was right about is The Guardian women were way smarter than the men. Naomi never got her hands dirty. So, she sent her little sister Angel to lead the pack.

And the buzz on the street is there's a new drug called Sugar and it's curing the Black community. - What kind of drug cures the Black community? - Sugar also cures cancer. - This drug can cure cancer? - Yes and not only cancer, but it cures high blood pressure, diabetes, sickle cell anemia issues, and so many other things that our Black community faces. - And this is a street drug? - Yes and pharmaceutical companies and the government is trying to find out what is the main source behind this drug so they could put a stop to it. Could you imagine how much money they're going to lose behind this if it goes worldwide? - This sounds like it would save the Black community and their lifespans would double. This isn't a drug. - Yes. - This sounds like a miracle! (upbeat rock music) - [Ms. Blackwell] Ms. Nicholson, you do know why you're on the stand? - Yes, ma'am, I do. - Good. Let's start from the beginning. Do you know DeAngelo Summons? - Yes, I know him. He was my man of two years. Before the members of Dynasty killed him and he was murdered. (Page sniffles) - I am so sorry to hear that. Do you think you know why he was murdered? - Yes, I know why he was murdered! The members of The Dynasty killed him! He was a good man! (Page cries) - You do know he was drug dealer? - He wasn't no drug dealer! My man saved lives! He was a hero! - Page, can you tell us how you met Mr. Summons. (Page cries) - [Mouse] From the night he met Page until he was murdered, he made it his business to make her happy. (funky music plays) She soon learned he was part of The Guardian. But, she didn't care. He tried to never do dirt around her. (phone rings) - Baby, your phone, your phone. - Shit. - Your phone. - Hello? All right, I'm on the way. (DeAngelo sighs) - Get a call to leave? - Yeah, I'll be back. - All right. I guess I'll leave, too. I got a couple of things to do, too. I'll see you tonight? - Yeah, you can call. (smooth jazz music) - Let me help you. (lips smack) Call me later. - I got you. Oh, I almost forgot. - Oh, thanks, babe! - You know I got you.

You know, if I could find his killer, I would seek justice for him and his family. - No further questions, your honor. - Sir, I know you ain't gonna like this, but I got some bad news to report. - You know what happened the last time you brought me bad news, right? Do you remember? - Yeah, I, I remember. - That means this must be very, very important. How many people I got to kill this time? It's like a war out here in these streets! - Sir, blood has already been shed. They call themselves taking over The Guardians. - The Guardians are stupid and the little sense that The Dynasty has, they learned from the GeeChees. Sugar saves lives, but these people, they get greedy and motherfuckers gotta die. - I agree. - Teddy, go get the cabinet together. The Geechees will handle it! - Say less.

You are familiar with the drug Sugar. - I'm quite familiar with the drug Sugar. Yes, I am. I'm very familiar with it. - Can you tell us what Sugar is? - To my understanding Sugar became a miracle drug. It's caused a drastic sells within our American economy and our drug cartel market and so it became a dra, a very serious concern when it deals with our profits. - Drastic, what exactly do you mean when you say drastic? - Well, when I mean drastic, you know that American economy is fueled by the pharmaceutical market and when we have individuals or people that's not buying over-counter drugs it causes major serious concern within the pharmaceutical industry. - No further questions, your honor.
