Over 400 years ago, William Shakespeare wrote Macbeth, the medieval story of the Thane of Glamis and his wife, who are inspired by witches' sorcery to commit mayhem and murder and to take the crown of Scotland. Since earliest times, actors who have performed Macbeth, have thought the play to be... cursed. Oh, dear. It's so rural. At least we are no longer on a motor coach. Oh. Okay, that'll do. Aw, it's so cute. - Okay. - I gotta see what he wants. - Oh. - Oh. It's better than I thought. Pretty quiet. Yeah, we were supposed to be met. - I'll go look for the guy. - Okay. George? George? You here? Oh, my god. Look at this place. Look. Now, this is a theater! A sight for sore eyes! Yes. Huh. No, no, no. - What? - Angels of ministers and grace defend us! Angels of ministers and grace defend us... No, no. Young man. You should never, ever whistle in a theater. Oh, please. The only thing worse is letting the ghost light go out. Ooh, what's the ghost light? That... is the ghost light. And it must always remain burning on an empty stage. Or what? It'll get dark. How magnificent! This will be the place of my greatest triumph. Our collective triumph, I believe. Our company, our triumph. Our burden. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow... creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last... ...syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays, are... lighted fools... the way to dusty... death. You are really... starting to embody this role, Alex. Hmm? You're really starting to embody this role. Ah, yeah, it did feel different, didn't it? - Didn't you feel it? - Yeah. - I felt it. - Yeah. But I would say that the Scottish King himself, could not have done better. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, because he's dead? Pay no attention. Every line, remembered. No easy task. - Well done. - Thank you. Welcome! Welcome, everyone. This is George Pitard, he... he owns the place. Wow. Well, we sometimes think it does own us. What a charming old theater. Ah, merci beaucoup, mademoiselle! Oh. Uh... my grandfather, he build it. We close for two years, but decided to open again now that the tourism is picking up. For the leaf peepers. Oh, and you are doing the play Mac... Oh, The Play Scottish, eh? Perfect, no? Right where we left it off. I'm guessing it was... It was very popular. Uh... Not so much. What the hell does Madeline keep in this thing? An ex-husband. Do you have any bars? Nope. No bars. Wi-Fi? This look like the kind of place that has Wi-Fi to you? You've got to be kidding me. Even Appalachia had Wi-Fi. I'm waiting for a callback. You've been waiting for that call back as long as I've known you. Ouch. You know, Madeline, I've been thinking, this theater is... is so intimate. It's beautiful. Maybe you should tone down your third witch just, just a little here. What... what do you mean? Well... this is Shakespeare, it's... It's not Vaudeville. Vaudeville? I received spectacular reviews for my first witch in London. With Mr. Derek Jacobi. I remember, but the witches should be... malevolent. Not... hysterical. Hysterical? Shall I show you the difference between malevolent and hysterical? Oh, boy. I am done with your insults and lack of talent. Now that was malevolent and this is hysterical. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! - Macbeth! Macbeth! - Hey, what's going on? Macbeth! - That didn't go so well. - Macbeth! - Uh, Archie. - Macbeth! Won't you, uh... go and get her, make her run around the theater to undo it. Run? That's gonna take a while. Well, carry her if you have to. All right. Wait, undo what? The curse. Are you serious? We are performing the Bard's... greatest and most dangerous play. - You mean, Mac... - No, no. Just stop. You cannot say the name of The Scottish Play in the theater unless it is part of the performance. It unleashes the witch's evil magic. The name is cursed. The play... is cursed. Put me down, you little shithead! Oh, god. Whoever let you into the theater... And... and everyone believes that? Oh, everyone knows that. Apparently, in some ancient production, some jealous actor killed the star with a real knife in the murder scene. And in doing so, was doomed to play the part for all eternity. And even the greatest role created for the stage can be tedious after a century or two. Goddamn it, just put me down! Put me down, you Neanderthal! Just put me down! It's done. All the way around? She swore, she spit? I spit, she swore. You heard her. Uh, but... she did not beg to be readmitted to the troupe. You know the rules, Madeline. Beg! But I am not sorry. You don't have to be sorry, but you do have to beg. Now, my buttery biscuit. You don't want some unfortunate, unforeseen circumstance to be on your conscience, do you? Oh, please, my liege, my Lord. Uh, may, I, poor maid that I am, know again the warmth of your radiance and rest beneath the towering branches of your beautiful cherry... Okay, okay, Madeline. Very nice. Very nice. - Really, was it? - Yes, it was. Now, tell me the truth. - Was it good? - No, it was beautiful. - It was very nice. - Thank you. Welcome back. Henry... I'm so happy to be back. Thank you. So, the kitchen is stocked, and the Levesque sisters soon will be here. They drive the car from Montreal, eh? Do they know the place well? Oh, very well. They have come many seasons. They can be help for you with costumes, should that be the need you have. They were excited when I told them we were to make things go again. Sorry I was a dick out there. I guess... ...I don't quite know how to be. Like I do? How's your room? Uh, it's good. Yours? It's nice. You're, um... You're welcome to come visit. Uh, we could run lines or... I think... that might make it harder to get to the... just friends stage. I know. I know. I just, uh... I just miss you, though. Me, too. Tomorrow... and tomorrow, and tomorrow... creeps in this petty pace, from day... to day, until the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. A... oh, fuck... Well, I should be playing Macbeth. Macbeth. Macbeth. Macbeth! Macbeth! You are so naughty. Oh, hello. I knew I would find you here. - And so you did. - Yeah. Hmm. God. I don't know how many, how many more of your husband's performances I can endure. Well just imagine the performances that I have to endure. Oh, god. No, thanks. That's horrifying. Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll play the Scottish king... - Yeah? - ...soon enough. - Mm-hm. - Do you mean Macbeth? Yeah. Yes. You will, one day, be the greatest... Mm-hm. ...Macbeth! Oh! Ever. - Come on. - Oh. We gotta go. - Before your husband sees us. - Okay. - Tonight? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Before his Xanax kicks in. What was it that you saw in him, anyway? Was it the moustache? ♪ I'll be loving you ♪ ♪ Always ♪ Troy. Look behind you. We've been dancing to this... - So cute. - ...since before Annabel was born. I remember as if it were only yesterday. My little radish. Okay, does this look good? - I think so, I think we're done. - Mm-hm. All right, everyone. Linguini al pomodoro e polpetto for 11. - Yay! - Dinner is served. Thank, god. I'm starving. Oh, my god. This looks fabulous. Thanks. You've always liked my cooking. Oh, my gosh, it smells so good. I am starving. This is nice. It'd be fun to run a place like this, huh? Hmm, and your job would be refilling the glasses? Someone has to pour. Yes, and someone has to drink. Did I ever tell you about my connection to Top Gun? No. Oh, god. If I have to listen to this threadbare story one more time, I'll hang myself. Come on, I had over four callbacks for that movie. - Really? - Mm. When I met with Tony Scott, he assured me I had the part. Wait, of Maverick? Hm? The Tom Cruise part? No, no. Duck, the guy who died. Goose. Mm. The character was Goose. Duck, duck, goose. Whatever. I have much better hair than Anthony Edwards. Really, good hair can be very important. Yes, very. Oh. What was that? 'Allo, 'allo! The wind is picking up, eh? We are the sisters Levesque. Your caretakers. We are a little late, sorry. Yeah, George said you'd be coming. - Welcome. - I am Eloise. - Hi. - And this is Edna. So nice to be meeting all of you. Oh, I see someone knows the cooking? Yeah, there's plenty for you. Oh, thanks to you. Maybe we should be the actors and you the cooks, eh? I don't think it's funny. It's not funny to me. - Good night. - Bonsoir, my darling. Oh, there you are, honey buns. I've been looking all over for ya. Watcha doin'? - Mmm. - Oh, oh. Oh, alone time again. Got it. Got it. Well, I'm feeling kinda bushed, thinking about turning in. - How about you? - In a bit. - Okay. - Okay. Don't be too long, if you know what I mean. I know what you mean. Okay, sweetie. Okay. Whoa. This storm makes me horny. Hey, honey. Honey? I just had an idea. How about we do a little, uh, doctor-patient play? It's been a while since your last checkup. Okay, great idea. I put your Xanax on the table. Already took it. That's why we only have a short window, my sweet. I can't wait. Me neither! I'm just taking off my face, okay? Don't take off too much. I like it the way it is. Well you know, so much of the thrill is in the anticipation. Yes, maybe for you. Ah. Dr. Osgood is back! Honey! What's takin' so long? My appointments are backing up. Ah! Troy, Troy, please. Please, please, please. Please, can I come in? Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm ready. - Thou... - Jesus! ...shall be Macbeth! Oh, my god. Jesus. It's you. And who were you expecting? You, of course. It's just, the lightning... startled me. Does this startle you? What's wrong? - You seem tense. - No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm... Yeah. I am, actually. I am. Because I don't think I can work for that amateur for one more day. - He's Dr. Osgood, M.D. - Mm. He has saved thousands of lives over 17 glorious years. Yeah, yeah. What a genius. You know, being a soap star, doesn't make you an actor. It does make you rich, though. Well, maybe he should've spent some of that money on drama classes. Hmm. And what do you suggest as an alternative? Mmm, an accident? I love your dirty mind. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, the stage can be a very unpredictable and dangerous place. - Mm-hmm, yes. - Mm-hm? Yes, it can. Thomas, you want to go back to the beginning of Banquo's last scene? No, it's okay. I'll start here. Okay. - I figure we put... - Thou hast it now. ...a show on his entrance. We could go with blue, red... King, Cawdor, Glamis, - all as the weird women... - Henry! I'm ready for a run through of the dagger scene. Uh, right. Uh, that's a good place to start. Of course, I know my part. Jeez. Is he going deaf or just... playing dumb? He's not playing. Jason. Jason! Jason! Focus, Jason. Dagger scene. You better know your lines, Annabel. Yup. Oh, Archie. Uh, we're gonna need you to play the second witch. Uh, I thought Nigel was doing that? No, he's having trouble making his makeup change into Malcolm. Okay. Jason! Mm. Hold that thought. Yeah, sorry. Jason! Goddamn it! Where's the dagger? Thank you. Little higher, please. Good. Alex, just stand there and reach for it. Okay, okay, you're... Reach for it, but do not take - possession of it. Remember? - Oh. - Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yeah, yeah. - Okay? It's a vision. All right? A haunted dagger. Okay? Theatrical illusion. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. - Right. - Right? - Theatrical illusion. - Okay. Yeah, yeah, of course. Sorry, sorry. It's just... Okay. Is this a dagger, which I see before me, handle, toward my hand? Come, come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet... I have thee not, and... Hey, Henry. - Henry. Sorry, sorry - Hm? I just... I have an idea. Now, I know you said I shouldn't touch it, but, but... how about, how about we mix it up a little and I do, actually, grab the knife. - No, Alex. - Huh? You don't... mix up William Shakespeare, Alex. You can't grab the phantom knife. It's just... It's so tempting to have a prop to work with, ya know? Yeah. Especially when you've got so little talent to work with. What did he say? I said, "Especially when you've got so little talent to work with." Well, how about I... How about I fire you? And then you have no job to work with. How about them apples? Stop! Stop it! Cut the crap, you two! You understand me? - Now, kiss and make up. - Huh? Fine. I use a lot of tongue. Uh, Thomas? You can give them the cue. - Yeah? - Yup. Um... It will rain tonight. Let it come then! All right, all right, all right! All right. Enough. God, stop. I thought we were rehearsing. Just take it easy. Jesus. - It just feels so right. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - You want it to be convincing. - Right? - Uh... Well, a little more butch, certainly. But, uh, just, why don't you save your testosterone for tomorrow night, okay, guys? Let's, uh, let's do it again. Hello? Hi, um... do you know where I sign up for the yoga retreat? Oh, we, uh... Uh, that's not here. This is the theater. Riverside Resort, right? I saw it on Trip Advisor. Oh, my goodness. That was three years gone ago. Mr. George, he thought it could be a money maker, but... nothing. - Oh. - Are you, um... are you hiking the Appalachian Trail or something? Yeah, and I scheduled my entire hike around this retreat, so. Oh, god. Oh, my goodness. Who is this I am seeing now? Edna, she came for the yoga retreat. Eloise and I cannot even do the downward canine, I'm afraid. Oh, young lady, what is your name? - Juliet. - Oh, Juliet. Beautiful name. - It's French. - Mm. Oh, you stay for refreshment, Juliet? Uh, no, no, I'm really fine. Yeah. Why not? Stay, stay with us. I don't want to impose. It's not an imposition. Really. Oh, at last! Nap time! Die, Duncan! Fainting. Oh, Elliot. Must you? Haven't lost my touch have I, darling? Impressive. A method taught to me by Sir Lawrence Olivier's stunt double himself. What happened to Nigel? The sight of blood. Does it every time. But it's not real blood. Oh, well! Then it must have been your performance, dear. Oh. Thank you. Only one small problem, really. What's up? I cannot get up. Don't worry, I got you. Uh, crown, please. Thank you. Let's have a look at our king then, huh? Alex. It's amazing! It doesn't make me look, uh... No, you look absolutely regal. I do? Huh. I guess I do, don't I? Well... Uh, your king is eternally grateful. - Oh. - As... we all are. We love the show people. Beautiful, beautiful. Yes, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, pull it out. Till Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane. - No! Save it! - Huh? Okay, it's time for the witches to meet the Scottish King. Archie, why don't you go get your wig? - Got it. - What? - Hang on. - Mm-hm. Sorry. I thought this was just a straight run through? We've got our first performance tomorrow night. No, we have to run Archie's lines, so. I just wanted to say thanks before heading out. Henry. - Hmm. - Why don't we, uh... ask this young lady if she'd like to play the second which? I have this covered. Me? I, I, I really need to get going. No. No, actually, I... I think that could work. Honestly, it probably would be better to have a woman with us, at the cauldron. No offense, Archie. None taken. Have you ever acted before? A little in high school. Well you'll fit right in here, then. Performing Shakespeare can be thrilling. You know, we did do some Shakespeare, actually. Ans there is, of course, a modest stipend. Most modest, I assure you. Well, it would be nice to sleep in a bed for a change. I just... I don't want to embarrass you. Oh, dear, we are able to embarrass ourselves quite capably without additional help. Oh, Elliot. This... is our dressing room. And here, here is our makeup. Mm-hmm. So much fun, isn't it? Here are our costumes. - Oh, wow. - Ooh. And here, my darling, is your robe! - Wow. - Oh, yes. They really help us get into character, you see. - Wow. - Even in rehearsals. It looks amazing. It's just like playing dress up when we were little, right? And to get to stage right, we go this way. Be careful, my darling, watch your step. Oh, here are our props. Follow me. The flooring is a bit uneven. Watch your step, watch your step. Oh. Oh, yes. Old theater, old wiring. You'll get used to it. I'm sure. So, Juliet, we go under the stage, and then we pop up on the other side. It's so cool. Juliet. It was brilliant. And all our yesterdays... have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Very funny. Turn the lights back on. Jason? Turn the lights on, please. I'm rehearsing here. Thomas? Is that you? Jason? Hello? Anybody there? Help! Alex is hurt, I don't know what happened! - Hurt? What? - What? - Oh, no. - Nobody panic. Nobody panic. Alex. Alex. Hey, wake up, man! - Alex. - Alex? - Alex. - Mm? - Can you hear me? - Liz Beth. - Is that you? - Yes. I, I, can hear you, but I... I can't see you. What happened? I, I don't know. I heard something, and... And then everything went black. The curse! Oh, god. What curse? I'm fine. Uh, let me... let me sit up. Let me sit up, and... and gather my thoughts. Well, that should be quite a harvest. - Alex. - Hm? You sure you're all right? Of course, I'm all right. I'm better than all right. Here, help me up. After a near-death experience, one sees one's purpose in a new and crystalline light. I am ready to give the Scottish King my all. Tomorrow, and... Uh... Line? - Uh, "Tomorrow." - Ah! Yes, that's right. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and, uh... - Uh, line? - "Tomorrow." Oh, yes. How could I forget. Uh... Oh, it's right there. Just over the rainbow, my darling. Oh, dear! Oh, dear. I'm still a little high, but I'm fine. - I'm all right. I'm fine. - I say bravo! - Courage! - I say bravo! - Courage! - I'm okay. Bravo! Okay. Yes, done. Okay. All right, Thomas. Looks like you're gonna have to play The Scottish King, and I'll do Banquo. As you wish, my Lord. Cut the crap. You know, I do not know how Alex got whacked, but he did. And now, you're our only choice. I'm ready. You know, you might be a good actor, but you're a consummate asshole. The only good thing about this, is that we get to cut your head off in the last scene. Thanks for your support, Henry. Where is the Thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels, but he rides well. See, see our honored hostess. Out! Damn spot. Uh, wrong scene? That's Act Five. Act Five. Look at my hands. They're lovely hands. Yeah. They don't show your age at all. I just need a little help washing the blood off. Sorry. Guess it's happy hour already, huh? - Come here. Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm, I'm realizing, that... how upsetting it must have been to see Alex get hurt. Henry, I need you to help me wash this blood off of my hands. You know I love the method acting, Liz. But there is no blood, in reality, there's... there's no blood. - No? - No. No, no blood. - But, no... - No! But very, very, convincing. I mean, that... that's some real conviction. Like... Crazy ass conviction. Oh, that's... Uh, there is no blood. I see that now. There's no blood. There's no blood. - All right. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - No, no, no. Let's give us a start from the top. - Let's go back to the top. - Okay. - Come on, dear. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - No, no, no. Come on. - Oh. Fresh start. Very good. - Whoo! - All right? You're like so in it. - Got me. - Wow. I thought I saw it, you know? Okay. I think maybe it's time to start thinking about you playing Lady Macbeth. - Okay. - From the "Thane of Cawdor." So... seems I will be Macbeth. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it does seem that way, doesn't it? You know, I dreamed it last night. It's probably a prophecy. It's not a prophecy if you make it happen, Thomas. Seriously? I... I had nothing to do with that. You don't think I'd actually try and kill him? Well, you did say that there would be an accident. You know how the play goes. We murder the king. Okay, well. Alex is on permanent bed rest now, so... all's well that ends well. Oh, maybe for you. - Hm? - You know. Maybe for you. Why don't you man up? - Huh? - Hm? Why don't you man up? Come to my woman's breast. Yeah, all right. Okay, okay, Liz. You're scaring, scaring... you're scaring me. Enough with the Lady Macbeth shit, okay? Maybe everything ends well for you, but it doesn't end well for me, it never does. Is this... a dagger which I see before me? The handle toward my hand? Come... let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and... yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind? A false creation, proceeding... from the heat-oppressed brain. Bravo! Bravo! Spectacular! Bravo! You know, I, I kinda felt that, Henry. - We all did, Alex. - Oh. Oh, well done... my King! What happened? Alex is recovered. More than recovered, actually. Cured. He just got some crazy-assed kind of theatrical penicillin. No, no, no. No. That can't be. That can't be. We... We should be sensitive to his injury. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that... - struts. - And our eyes do not deceive us. I, for one, am willing to call it a miracle and leave it at that. It is a tale... told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury, signifying... nothing. - What happened? - Don't ask. ♪ The weird sisters Hand in hand ♪ ♪ Posters of the sea and land ♪ ♪ Thus do go about, about ♪ ♪ Thrice to thine And thrice to mine ♪ ♪ And thrice again To makeup nine ♪ ♪ Peace ♪ ♪ The charm's wound up ♪ So foul and fair a day, I have not seen.

Everybody, take five minutes. Let's do the whole scene again. Alex, come here, come here, I want to talk to you. I got a great idea. Okay. He's good. What? - He's very good. - Yeah, no, I heard you. He's still an imbecile. I mean, idiot savants can play Mozart. "All hail Macbeth." I can't take it anymore. You had your chance. Alex! Alex! Huh? I've been... I've been looking for you. What?

Thomas and I set off the curse. Liz... there's no curse. How do you know that, though? How can you be sure? Trust me. The idea of it... helps bring the play's sorcery to life. That's... That's all, it's... Hmm. Okay. So, maybe we're just all... ench... enchanted... enchanted by the possibility. Exactly. Great acting demands... surrender to the imaginary. And you are a great actress. Thank you. So, you'll come back inside? - All right? - Okay. Yeah. Yes. All right. Sure. Oh! Oh, Jason! Kill him. This thou must do! Oh! You wicked girl. You know how I like a little rough trade. That was fun. Do it again. Do it again. - No. No. - Huh? What? Why not? Honey, come on. Put the pillow on my face. Tank it in. Hold it down. Come on, come on! No? Unsex me. What? What is it? What? Something wicked this way comes. Are you okay? Hello? Hello? Did you hear something? Apparently, we all did. I heard... I heard voices. It's just the wind. The wind? - Uh-huh. - Perhaps a cup of tea? - Maybe? - No. No. No. Scotch, I'm thinking scotch. Oh, this weather doth murder sleep. - Oh! - Oh, shit. Oh, my nerves. Do not be afraid, my dear. It is only nature at her most dramatic. Yes. Well, I like comedy. It's kinda spooky. - Hey. - Hi. Where's Jason? He fell asleep. How rude. Well, even the randiest of roosters must nap occasionally. Oh, my darling, pie? Oh, no. It's okay, South Beach diet. Well, we should all follow Jason's lead and turn in, got a big day tomorrow. I believe I would wait here for nature's grand finale. Ah! And I, I shall keep you company. Excellent. You always are welcome. All right, then. That should do it. No curtain call for me. No. Did you miss me... ...my King? Hm? Jesus! Oh, my god. Oh, my god. That was terrifying. Hey. Hey, Liz? I just had the craziest dream, Liz? Liz? Oh, god! No, no! No, no! That's, that's not quite the reaction that I was... that I was expecting. What? - Boo! - Oh! Jeez! What? I don't know why you did that. Why did you do that? Oh, you look like you'd seen a ghost, and I just thought I would help you out. I just, I had the most... bizarre dream. - Yeah? - Don't. Sorry. Just don't... No. Why? What's wrong? Nothing. No. Something's wrong. It's that little slut Juliet, isn't it? Hm? I see the way you've been looking at her. Look at her? I don't look at her. I... I mean, I look at her. But I'm just a grown man. I do... that's what we do, we look. We admire. But that's not all you do, is it? Um... This is what you want. What? Or is it this? Uh... Or maybe this? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Penis. Oh, go away, go away, go away. Go away, go away, go away! Oh, shit. Macbeth! Macbeth! Kill thee! Must do... Thou shall be Macbeth! Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine, and thrice again to make up nine. Peace! The charms... No! Thou shall be Macbeth! Ah! No, no! No, no, no! No, no, no! No! No! No! No! Uh... Oh, shit. Um... Did you, um... Did you come into my room last night? You don't remember? Uh, no. No, not, not clearly. Well, if you can't remember, then neither can I. I've been thinking. Um... About how to take care of our Alex situation? What? No. Well then, what else... ...my King? Well actually, it's, it's on, um, it's on that point. I, I... You're weak. Uh... You're weak just like he is. Just like Macbeth. Just perfect for the part. Pathetic. So, we're all heading over to start getting ready. That includes you. Right? Look, um... I warned you about this. It better not be any of your bullshit. I'm... I'm just not feeling myself, actually, so... That's strange. That's usually... the only person you have feelings for. Right? Yeah, I didn't sleep last night, so... Well, no one did. But the show, it's gotta go on, okay? Unless you're too unwell to perform. No. No, no. I... You haven't noticed anything unusual recently, have you? Uh, just that, um... just that everybody's really upped their game. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't think that's strange? Just the result of all our hard work. Okay. Okay. And one last thing, you don't, um... you don't believe in the haunted play idea... do you? Really? Did you just ask me that? - It's nothing. - For god's sake. It's just... Oh, my god. - So we're good, right? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, we're good. Okay. Holy shit. Stars... hide your fires. Let no light see thy black and deep desires. We shall be Macbeth. Yeah. See, I'm not, I'm not so sure. Do not disappoint us. Get thee, now hence. And let sun ne'er rise again without ambitions fated, treasure tight, within thy grasp. Uh... Mm. Okay. I'm, okay. Come on. Show time. Yup? Can I come in? Yeah, of course. Oh, Thomas. Sweetheart. I was a little abrupt earlier. I know I have been an absolute mess. And too hard on you. And I really don't want you to carry any bad feelings out onto the stage tonight, okay? Yeah, of course. Whoo! - Feels good to get that out. - Mm. Break a leg. Yeah? May I come in? Oh, Thomas, sweetheart. That was a little abrupt earlier. I know I've been an absolute mess. And too hard on you. And I really don't want you to carry any bad feelings onto the stage tonight, okay? Whoo! Feels good to get that out. Break a leg. What? What? Something else? Something else? You were just here. I was? Yes. You were. When? Just now. Literally just now. Just now. What the hell is going on? What have we done, Liz? Liz? Something wicked this way comes, my King. Something wicked. Yeah. it does. Archie? Archie? Yes, Henry. Are these rolling set pieces gonna work? And did you set the final light cues? Did you check the taped marks, go over the prop table... Yes, yes, yes. And yes to the next three things you're gonna ask me. Henry, we've done this play 50 times. Henry, my love. What do you think? Did you use a mirror or just your intuition, Madeline? I thought it was very scary. Well, yeah, and maybe too much so. We might have children in the audience. We... We have to be careful. Oh, thank you for the note. Thank you. Mr. Henry. Mr. Henry. I am coming now from town, and am reporting to you from Mr. George, that we have no more seats to sell. Is good? Is good? Is unbelievable! - Henry. - Huh? Sold out? We're all sold out? Oh! Sold out. We are sold out! Is that unusual? Oh, it never happens. So exciting. The feel of a packed theater is absolutely thrilling. Oh! Sold out, everyone! Sold out! So great, isn't it? Okay, places everyone, please. - Okay, oh. - Just, go, go, go. Okay, witches, Jason, you ready? And, curtain. When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain? When the hurly-burly's done, when the battle's lost and won. That will be ere the set of sun. - Where the place? - Upon the heath. There to meet with... Macbeth! Oh, here we go. Show number 51. Two scenes, and I'm dead. All right. Ready, Cue 11. Cue 11, go. What bloody man is that? He can report, as seemeth by his plight of the revolt, the newest state. This is the Sergeant, who like a good and hearty... Where's Liz Beth? Tell me she's sober. She's a professional, don't worry. Yeah, and she's also an alcoholic. And she's on in five. - Where's Thomas? - Ready, Cue 12. Cue 12. Go. The merciless Macdonwalds. Worthy to be a rebel, for to that, the multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him from the western isles, of kerns and gallowglasses. They made themselves air into which they vanished. Whilst I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all hailed me... Thane of Cawdor. By which title before these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with... "Hail, king that shalt be." "Hail, king that shalt be!" Is this... a dagger which I see before me? The handle toward my hand? Come. Let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not... Banquet scene is coming up, Elliot. Yes, of course. I'm ready. Well, these quick changes are gonna kill me. Yeah, what this company needs - is a few more actors. - You know... Uh, where the hell are they? Hey. Try a couple of deep breaths, my friend. You have managed to awaken an elderly man from a very pleasant sleep. Is there no bottom to the pit that is your cruelty? You're welcome.

I don't know! This is getting freaking weird. We're late already. Henry is looking for you. - No shit! - No shit! Okay, um... It doesn't matter. Just put something on. You got it on backwards.

Ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time, we will require her welcome. Announce it for me. To all our friends. - From my heart... - Okay, okay. speaks they are very welcome. Which of you have done this? What, my good Lord? Thou can'st not say I did it. Never shake thy gory locks at me! Gentlemen, rise. His Highness is not well. Sit, worthy friends. - Archie. - My lord is often... Remember how you lit Banquo's ghost tonight. It's perfect. - Are you a man? - Aye. And a bold one, that dare look at that which might appall the Devil! Double, double time. Let's go! - No. - I'm not ready! No, I... I look horrific. I'm not ready. No, come on. We're supposed to look horrific. - Let's go. Come on. - Oh, jeez. I'm not ready. I'm just not ready. Juliet, wait up! I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh, well, should we... - Let's go, let's go. - I'm a freight... - Juliet! - Freight train! Come on, Madeline. What are you doing? What, wait, where did she go? Will you stop fooling around? Madeline, come on. We need to hurry. Wait, can you... Off the wall, we're gonna miss our cue. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, let's go. Let's go. We're almost there. We're almost there. That's weird. We're back where we started. We have to go. No, no, no. We have to go. We're gonna miss it, we're gonna miss our scene. Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. Eye of newt and toe of frog, Wool of bat and tongue of dog. Liver of a blaspheming Jew! Gall of goat and slips of yew. Finger of birth-strangled babe, ditch delivered by a drab, make the gruel thick and slab. Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Something's not right. Come on, you should calm down. Where is the stage? Oh... How now, you secret, black and midnight hags? What is't you do? A deed without a name. Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten her nine farrow, grease that's sweaten from the murderer's gibbet, throw into the flame. Crap. Henry. What the hell is going on? We didn't kill Banquo. What are you talking about? It was brilliant. I mean, it was very realistic, guys. No, listen. We missed our scene. We didn't kill Banquo. Then who the hell did? And where is he? Archie, go find Thomas. ...of hemlock digg'd i' the dark No, it's... Macbeth! Macbeth! - Macbeth! - That's it. It's too real. I'm done. You play him, Henry. Jason, bucket! What? We're killing it out there. Thomas. We got a weird sit... Thomas? Thomas! Hey. Hey, hey, Thomas! Thomas. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, shit! Shit, shit, shit! There's knocking at the gate. Oh, come. Come. What's done cannot be undone. We're ready for you, my King. Ready for you, my King. Henry, we have a bit of a situation here. You're telling me? Where is Alex? Oh, thank god, there he is. Henry. - Hey, Henry. Henry! - Jason. Jason. - Henry. - Cue his spot, now. Thomas is dead. Tomorrow... and tomorrow. And tomorrow. What's going on? He was really stabbed. For real. Thomas is dead. Not completely. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out. Out brief candle. I'm telling you, he is dead. - Who's dead? - Thomas. And why the hell is he playing my part? Excellent question. I'm telling you, he is in his dressing room, right now, dead. Quiet, son. You're frightening me. It is a tale told by an idiot, all sound and fury, signifying nothing. Show me. Come on. Oh, no. Oh, my god. Oh, no. Green room. Now. - Oh, no! - Jason! Go quickly! Go! What? Is it time for the curtain call? Not quite, Elliot. - Thomas has been murdered. - He's dead. But, we have evidence to the contrary. Oh! - Oh! - It's locked, we're trapped. It's the curse. What are you talking about? We haven't done anything. I'm afraid someone did. Well, then someone better undo this shit. I don't know how. I don't know how. I pull in resolution, and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth. Fear not, till Birnam wood do come to Dunsinane. And now, a wood comes toward Dunsinane! There's no worry, please, hurry. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's Liz Beth? Wait. Oh, my god, Henry. She's still out there. Liz! Liz! Oh, what is that noise? This way, my Lord! The castle's gently rendered. The tyrant's people on both sides do fight. The noble thanes do bravely in the war... Who's doing the play? And why are they so damn good? Was that real? I will... not yield! Of all men else... I have avoided thee, Macduff. My poor Elizabeth is in danger! We need to help her. And I shall assist you in the rescue. I served in the Queen's militia as a young man. Good. Great. What do we do? - Battering ram! - Yes! - Yes. - Stand back! Off with his head! What is... what is happening? Oh, god. Uh, what? What is it? Close the door. Hello? Hello? You, you go ahead. I'll wait here. Good luck. Oh, no! Oh! Break a leg. Come. You are safe with me, my love. Oh, no. We need to grab something. - Troy. - Hm? If we don't make it... I love you. We're gonna make it. I hope. Liz Beth? Liz Beth! Where is she? She was right here. After her suicide. Oh, my god. She's gone, isn't she? You mean they're both... dead? Oh. They were such... wonderful actors. Perhaps they do live on... inside the play. Do you really think that's possible? Oh, I hope so. Hello? Who's there? 'Allo! 'Allo! We are so sorry for the delay we have been making. We are the sisters Levesque. Caretaker for Mr. George. Uh, the snow came very unexpected, and we are two days delayed. You make yourselves at home though, eh? - Ah, tres bien. - Yeah. Uh, Mr. George says you are doing Mac... The Play Scottish. Oh! Oh. Uh, when will be the opening, eh?
