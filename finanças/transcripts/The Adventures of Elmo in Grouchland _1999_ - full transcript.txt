All Elmo wants is his Blanket back. I didn't mean to... Don't worry, Zoey. Elmo's just a little upset right now. But, Bob, I didn't mean to rip his blanket. And then Telly came, and you saw it... Everybody, break it up. Nothing to see here. Move along. Just a little monster trying to get his Blanket back. - Thank you. - All right. Elmo can wait. Oscar will probably be back at any second. Any second now. And we're waiting. Elmo's waiting. Elmo can't wait anymore! Oh, wow. Elmo didn't know Oscar's place was this big. Blanket, there you are! Oh, Elmo's so glad to see you!

Where are you? Blanket! Very colorful! Wow. That was a fun ride. Gee. Look at this place. Where's Elmo's Blanket? And where is Elmo? Elmo doesn't think he's on Sesame Street anymore. - Hey, Red. You're in Grouchland. - The greatest place on Earth! A place where you can kick off your shoes and... smell your stinky socks! Oh, no. I think I feel a song coming on. Yuck! Wow. This is great. Yeah. Watch your toes. Musical number coming through. Hear the steady beat of sweaty feet. On the greasy streets of Grouchland. Smell the stinkweed gag the waving wheat. What a perfect day Make it stop! Come on! You missed a tire! Come on. Bring in the noise Bring in the junk. Step on a crack Step in the gunk. Home of the world's worst traffic jam Welcome to Grouchland Now scram. With the gum and goo beneath your shoe You can bet you stepped in Grouchland It's against the law to use shampoo so we wash with cheese Cheese, that's smelly. Yeah, yeah, yeah Here! Right here! You like me! You really like me! Now, get out of here! Get my good side. That's right. I don't have a good side. If you're growing old and love the coast. Spend your golden years in Grouchland Where the streets are paved in solid mold and the stinkbugs sing Sing! Yeah! Bring in the junk Step on a crack, step in the gunk Our motto: I grouch, therefore I am. Welcome to Grouchland. Welcome to Grouchland. Welcome to Grouchland Now scram! Wow. Grouchland sounds like fun. - What? - Fun? You obviously don't appreciate Grouch culture. Let's send him some greeting cards, airmail. - Have a rotten birthday! - Happy grouchness! - Yeah! Get sick soon! - Happy sour 16th! Elmo doesn't know how to read yet. Aww, isn't that too... Hmm? It's raining! Come on, girls! Rocket! Oh, no, it's Huxley again! He'll take anything! Go home, why don't you? - What's going on? - I'll take that. Hey, hey! You're taking his greeting card. I'll take that. Hey! Soggy Sandy wets her pants. That's why they call her Soggy. Watch her do her Soggy dance. - Then after you'll get wet. - Is that your new Soggy doll? - Yeah. - You're wrong. Guess who's changing its diapers now? Let go of her! No! They can't do that. That's not nice. Hey, put me down, you rotten Huxley! Wow! Stop! - I bet that hurt. Oh, yeah. - Are you okay? Did someone say "stop"? All right. Who said that? Which one of you dares to question my evil ways? He did. He did. - Elmo said it. - Hey, boss, he's the one. I heard him. It's the cute little red guy. - He's questioning your evil ways. - I know that, Bug. It's not nice to take things that don't belong to you. He also says it is not nice to take things that do not belong to me! - Isn't that just precious? - Yeah. Let me fill you in on something. It all belongs to me. If I touch it, I own it. Bug! You see this tennis racket? Ping! I own it. This hammer? Ping! I own it. This velvet painting of Elvis... I didn't really want it... but... ping... I own it. And this. Oh, Elmo's Blanket! You're wrong. I didn't borrow this blanket. I didn't rent this blanket. Heck, I didn't even take out a 36-month lease on this blanket. No. Ping! I own it! I think it's made of all-natural fibers... maybe 100% cotton. Very lovely. Bug, you really know how to ruin a villainous moment, don't you? Now get in the cartoonishly evil vehicle and drive! - Sir! Yes, sir! - No! Wait! Blanket! Blanket! You know, I would really love to stay and chat... but I have to get home to take a nap with my brand-new woobie. Say, "Bye-bye," woobie. "Bye-bye." - It's a Blanket! - Woobie! - Blanket! - Woobie! Mine! Blanket! Wait! Stop! Stop the movie! Stop the movie! - What's the matter, Bert? - Didn't you see what Huxley did? - Yeah. - He took Elmo's Blanket. Oh, I can't look. But don't worry, Bert. It'll be okay. Right, everybody? Because we know Elmo won't give up until he gets his Blanket back. Roll film! Let's watch, Bert. Oh, okay, Ernie, but I can't see anything. Bert, you still have your hands over your eyes. Oh. I... I knew that. Sure, you did, Bert. Come on. Please! Someone help Elmo, please. Excuse Elmo, can you... Oh, sir, can you please help Elmo get his Blanket back? I'd love to, but I don't speak English. But... Someone please help Elmo! Oh, excuse Elmo. That mean old Huxley took Elmo's Blanket! That makes me feel so bad inside. Oh, wait. I think that's just gas. No, please... Now what is Elmo going to do? Hey, you're the girl with the doll! The name's Grizzy. How come all the grouches just let that mean old Huxley guy take everything? The only way to stop Huxley is all the grouches would have to work together... and grouches hate that. But Elmo has to get his Blanket back! Okay, okay. Look. Maybe I can help you. Follow me. Okay. Elmo. Sorry, Cookie. Sorry. Elmo. Oh! Me having a bad cookie day! Oh, me head. Hey, everyone! Hey, hey! - What's the matter? - What's going on? Oscar said Elmo is gone. He probably went down into Oscar's can for his Blanket, but instead of getting a blanket he got sucked away into some far-off and grouchy place! - And he's never going to... - Easy, Telly. Oscar probably meant that Elmo went home, that's all. No. Actually, the worrywart's right. - What? - Say what? Yep. Elmo got sucked down through a door in my can to Grouchland, U.S.A. - Grouchland, U.S.A.? - Where's that? This is terrible! What are we going to do? What are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do. We're going to go down to Grouchland... ...whatever that is, and get Elmo back! Yeah! Well, all right, but be careful. I just had the rugs dirtied. Checking around the corner. Oh, joy! Fruity goodness! - Come on. Come on. - Elmo. - Come on. Hustle, hustle. - Are we there yet? Almost. Hold your horses, kid. Gee. Well, Elmo, there it is... Greedy Huxley's house on the top of Mount Pickanose. That's where your blanket is. All the way over there. Far, far away. Well, Elmo has to get it back by tonight. Maybe you're not hearing me. It's far, far away. Oh, that's okay, Grizzy. Elmo's done harder stuff than this before. Like what? Elmo learned to tie his own shoes. - What are you? Crazy? - Huh? If you go there, you might never make it back home again. Well, I think I've helped enough. Good luck to you, kid. But... Well, Elmo's going to make it! You'll see! Elmo's going to get to that Huxley's house and get his Blanket back! Who's Elmo kidding? Grizzy is right. Elmo will never get there. I'm stuck. Okay. Here we go, Telly. One, two, three, push. Thank you! We're coming, Elmo! That place is so far, far away. - You'll never get there, huh? - Who was talking to Elmo? - Oh, just a little green plant. - Huh? Me! How come nobody ever think the shrubbery got something to say? Huh? Huh? But I do, cause I know exactly how you feel. - You do? - I do! You feel like you're stuck! - Yeah. - Well at least you got your legs, am I right? - Yeah. - Well then all you got to do is take the first step. Now, lend me your ear. Elmo, get your chin up. Things could be worse You could have your feet stuck down in the earth I don't see no roots growing from your toes. Just two very little feet and they're Revving, revving, revving - To go. - Just a little step - And soon you will see. - Soon you'll see. Just how brave your heart can be. Look on up to the sky Take that first step. And kiss your fears good-bye Now, get up there, my little red mophead, and take that step. That's it. Look at that. I knew he could do it. Yeah! Wow. Destiny is callin' so listen up, please And you can feel the rhythm down deep in your knees. One foot, then the other Your journey has begun. Elmo, believe it You're ready, ready, ready to run Take the first step, soon you will see. Just how brave your heart can be Look on up to the sky Take that first step And kiss your fears good-bye. Look at that! There he goes. Hey, I knew he could do it. Yeah! Look at him go! That's it! Just keep on goin'. Take another step. Take the first step and soon you will see Just how brave your heart can be Look on up to the sky Take that first step Elmo, we believe in you Take the first step. You'd better watch out, Mr. Huxley. Elmo's coming to get his Blanket. Oh, that's rich, huh? He's little and red and he's coming to get his blanket! Excuse me, boss, didn't you hear the little guy? He's taking his first step. Shouldn't we do something? Well, ordinarily I wouldn't... but I am feeling a bit saucy today, huh? Saucy! - No pesto. - Alfredo and a little Parmesan, maybe, huh? A little Italian Parmesan. Perhaps I shall toy with the little red monster. But how? - Now, let me think. - Think, think. Wow, his eyebrows are huge! Those aren't eyebrows. That's my aunt and uncle. Maybe if I look at it this way. I know! I think it's time for Elmo to take a trip to the tunnel, if you know what I mean, huh? Yes? What'd you say, boss? - Bug, what are you doing? - Just having a little snack. Hard to do your evil bidding on an empty stomach. Oh, sure. Listen, Bug. Listen good. Are you listening? Get back to work! That was a wild ride! Wow. So this is Grouchland, huh? Yeah, land of a thousand stenches. Yeah, and I think I can smell a number of them rigth now. - Hey, look who it is! - It's Oscar! - Oscar? - You look like a million yucks. Yeah! Go away! Get out! Take your friends with you. Ah, who says you can't go home again? Oscar, maybe you can get your friends to tell us where Elmo is. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah yeah. In a minute. First, I have to look at the old neighborhood here. Hey, I wonder where that old septic tank is. Hey. Wait a minute! No. Oscar, we've got to find Elmo first! Yeah. Elmo! Let's go this way. - Have you seen Elmo? - Stop bothering us. First the little red guy, now you. Oh, look. There's a police officer. Yeah! Let's ask him for help. It's against the law to ask for help in Grouchland. You have the right to scream your head off. Should you give up the right to scream your head off someone who'll scream their head off will be provided for you. - Come on. - Me innocent. Hello? Me needs cookie? - Okay. Sidney. Little Ricky. - Here. - Howard. - Present. Listen. I'm going to get the trap door ready. You turn the arrow on the sign so that it points in the tunnel. - Got it. - Ready? Break. Break. Howard!

The boss is walking! Ow! Sharp rocks! Hot rocks! Pointy rocks! Should've worn shoes! Ooh-Ooh. The boss is walking! Baloney Sandwich again? Oh. Get back to work! Why is that little red furball so determined to get this blanket? Maybe because it's so devastatingly cuddly. - What do you think you're doing? - Just hugging Elmo's Blanket. Whose Blanket? I mean, your blanket. That's right. My blanket. And I'm the only one who can hold it. Hey, tissue, maybe you can be my blanket. - What do you think you're doing? - Just holding this tissue, boss. - Whose tissue? - Uh, your tissue, boss. That's right. Mine. Come here, Bug. It belongs to me. The issue at hand is the tissue at hand. And I wish you would hand or I'll squish you at hand. The tissue at hand to the man who can prove he can be. The most deserving he.

Something old, something new. Something borrowed, something blue. Things that once belonged to you. Like this plastic telephone I love this highway traffic cone. This wedding cake for Jill and Jake. This rake This giant rubber snake. This Chippendale Don't let it break Oops! It's true. Love is a many "splintered" thing. He sees it, takes it, makes it mine. You better believe it!

I almost performed in the bus and truck tour of West Side Story. They said I wasn't right for Maria. What do they know? - I feel pretty. - Oh, very pretty. You look pretty. You should take a weedwacker to those eyebrows. - What did I say? - Anyway, I digress. Right now, I need you to take care of my archenemy Elmo. Elmo... Elmo. Maybe... ...you should arrange a little introduction for him... ...to the Queen of Trash. Huh? Queen of Trash? But nobody ever escapes her dump. - Stop the movie! Ernie! - What's the matter now, Bert? Oh, this is not good. Huxley is being mean to Elmo. It's just not fair. Why would anybody be so mean to our little Elmo? Well, gee, Bert, maybe Huxley just hasn't learned how to share yet. Well... Well, Ernie, do you think he ever will? Maybe, Bert. I sure hope that he does. Don't you? Now come on, Bert, let's go find out what happens to Elmo. Okay. Good, great. Uh, Ernie? Problem. This way, Bert. Oh, boy. Elmo didn't know it'd take this long to get his Blanket back. Excuse Elmo! Excuse Elmo. Sorry, Mac, this whole area is closed for construction. Yeah. Bring it in, boys. - Slow, slow, slow. - What's going on? Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow... Stop. - Workmen? - Nice work, Joey. - Thank you. - What? See, we're putting in a new Tarbucks. Cause there just ain't enough of those places around when you want a nice latte. But Elmo has to go that way to get to Huxley's house. Hey, look. You're making me fall behind in my work here. But you look like a good kid, so I'll tell you which way to go. - Follow me. - Okay. In order to get to Huxley's, you gotta go down the path... ...through the dump, over there. Really? Well, thank you very much for your help. You're very nice. Nice? You think I'm nice? Yeah. Very nice. Thank you. You're welcome. He hugged me. - You're lucky you're married... - Ice cream. Anchovy swirl. - Right here. Ice cream. - Yeah. I'll take one. - Okay. - Hey, where's my topping?

Listen up cause this is all I have to say This could be the thing to get you on your way Just imagine what is old is new again Maybe then you'll understand I tell you take a look around.

You go, girl! - You go, baby! Everywhere you look a story can be told And the tales they tell are worth their weight in gold - Hey, that's very inappropriate. - Sorry. Settle down. Rotting castaways and broken bits of glass, I dare you. Take a look around and tell me that you don't see. Watch this. This is good. Just a worthless pile of rotting and debris. Cause I see a kingdom shining bright And if you try then you can see it too, yeah. You'll see the beauty if you look at something right It's all about your point of view.

He says he's on his way to Huxley's. - Huxley's, eh? - And maybe, maybe he's a Huxley spy. Yeah. You know what? I thought about that... Oh, Elmo's not a spy. Elmo just wants to get his Blanket back from Huxley. Cause it's mine. Well, you certainly sound like Huxley. No, Elmo doesn't. Elmo's not like Huxley. No, no! It's Elmo's Blanket! It's mine, mine! No! He says he's not like Huxley. Make him prove it, Your Highness. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, prove it! Well, I think It's time for the ultimate challenge. Oh, goody, goody! - What's the ultimate challenge? - You have to give me something. You see, Huxley could never give anyone anything. - That's true. - Now, if you're able to give... ...then you pass the ultimate challenge and you're free to go. Uh, what does Elmo have to give? Well, you have to give Her Royal Majesty... ...and that would be me... 100 raspberries. The Ultimate Challenge. Elmo doesn't have any fruit. Now, now, now. It's not fruit, dear Elmo. Like this. Watch. Ooh, that sends shivers down my spine. Elmo... Well, Elmo can do that. Elmo knows how to make that sound. Good. Now, I want you to give me 100 raspberries... ...in 30 seconds. Let me go get my raspberry counter. I'll get it, I'll get it. No, my turn. I want to get it. Thirty seconds to do a hundred?

Why should I when you can do it for me? Besides, I think I'm winning. Yay! I told you! This time I'm keeping it! Hey, Bug, that was the last ball. - Hey, let's try boxing! - Oh, no. Come on! Let me see you do your stuff. Come here, boy. Come on. Why, that little red bath mat. Bug, Bug. Bug, stop playing games. Come look at this. Wow. Would you look at that? Boy, that Elmo's something, huh? What guts! What spunk! What chutzpah! - Bug. - Huh? You are really beginning to bug me. Huh, probably cause I'm a bug. What is it with this blanket? That's it. It's time to take care of that little red fuzzwad once and for all. Oh, no! No, no, no, no. Out of my way. It is time to release the secret weapon. No, boss. Anything but that. You can't do it to the little guy. Oh, really? Well, I've had enough toying with that little red lint ball. Just watch. Ping! Hello, Tiny. Come on. Rise and shine! We have work to do! Elmo, you'll make it. Just be strong, little guy. See a kingdom What's that? It's getting closer! Chicken! I'm not that afraid of a little chicken. Why should Elmo be afraid of a little chicken? That's why. Hey, you dinner. Stop running away from me. I'm trying to eat you. Leave Elmo alone! Elmo doesn't want to be eaten. Will you stop jumping around so much? You're going to make me gassy. Leave Elmo alone! You see what I mean? Now, stand still like a piece of corn. Hey, this is not how eating works. You stay still and then I sneak up on you... ...and then I eat you. So come on. I'm ready for a nice, juicy worm like you. No! Wait, wait! - Elmo's not a worm. - Excuse me. I'm not stupid. - Elmo knows you're not stupid. - Good. But, but worms aren't red, are they? Oh, well, sometime... Well, no. - Well, couldn't they be? - No. No, no. Uh-uh. Worms aren't fuzzy. Well, yes, but if... Will you just be quiet so I can eat you? Hey, worms can't do this... Elmo's a little teapot short and stout. Here is his handle Here is his spout When you tip me over Hey, wait a minute. You're not a worm. That's what Elmo was trying to tell you that. - You're a teapot. - Huh? I can't have tea. I haven't had my din-din yet. Wow. Not quite what I had in mind, but effective nonetheless. This is not fun. Oh, no. Are you guys still here with Elmo? Yes! Oh, good. Elmo feels a lot better with you here. But Elmo still misses his Blanket. Wait, wait, wait. Stop the movie again. - Ernie, Ernie! - What now, Bert? Well, Ernie, this is terrible. Elmo didn't get his Blanket back. How can it end this way? - It's so sad. - Oh, no, no, no. Bert. Bert. Bert. No, Bert. Listen. - Don't "Bert" me. - No, it's okay, Bert. The movie's not over yet. You mean good things could still happen? Of course they can, Bert. In fact, I'm sure good things will happen, because who'd want to see a movie with a sad ending, Bert? - Titanic. - What? Titanic had a sad ending. No, Bert. Roll the film! Come on, Bert. Come on. - Gone With The Wind? - No, Bert. - Dr. Zhivago? - Shh. Quiet, Bert. Chocolate-covered fish cakes. Hey, hey, hey, you. You tangerine. Maria, there's a grouch. No, no, no. Wait. I really want to help. Well, who, who are you? All right, all right, all right. I'm Elmo's friend Grizzy. - Now listen. - Elmo's friend? Hey... Don't let it get around that I'm helping Elmo! - So, where is he? - He went to Huxley's. What? Huxley! First this guy ruined my beautiful Grouchland and now he's messing with my fr... Oscar. Were you going to say "friend"? No, I was going to say "french-fried fish heads." All right. So the little stinkball is my friend. I got to go do something about this! Hey. Listen up, you grouch potatoes. - Come on over here. Listen to me. - Why should we listen to you? - I gotta get my ugly rags. - Go soak your head, huh? You call yourselves grouches. Look at you. This Huxley character has taken everything that makes Grouchland so disgusting and you're not doing anything about it! We've got to fight for our trash. - Yeah. - Stand up for our slop! - Yeah. - Cause... ...when they take our goo, uh, we got to do! Yeah, that's right! When they take our goo, we got to do! When they take our goo, we got to do! I love goo! When they take our goo, we got to do! When they take our goo, we got to do! Hey, you, get up! You're in my spot! - Get out of my spot now! - Huh? Elmo's sorry. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey. Don't cry. I can get a new spot. - Elmo's not sad about that. - Oh. Well, what then, huh? Come on, my friend, tell me what's wrong. Elmo didn't get his Blanket back! Elmo can't do anything! Elmo's just a little monster! Little? Hey, look at me, huh? I'm just a little tiny caterpillar, right? - Yeah. - Wrong. One day I'm going to be a butterfly. - You are? - Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna change into a beautiful butterfly. Yeah, I will. Cause I have what it takes... ...right here inside. And you know what, kid? So do you. You proved it by getting this far. Just look inside. Yeah. You're right! Inside! Elmo can do it! Elmo can get to Huxley's house. Yep. I knew you could, kid. Thank you, Mr. Caterpillar, thank you! Don't worry, Blanket! Elmo's coming! - Go ahead, eat it. - You think he'd mind? - Ah, he wouldn't mind. - Hey, that bacon's for the boss! And besides, Howard, your cholesterol level's way too high. - Hey. - Morning, boss. - Morning, Bug. - I made you some poached eggs. I pressed your favorite slacks, the ones that make you look... thin and villainous, and I brewed you some coffee. - Anything about me in the paper? - Check page six. What's it say? You know I can't read. Says you're a greedy, no good... I mean, a lovely man. Thank you, Bug. Oh, it's a wonderful day. My sun is shining, my birds are chirping... and my humongous chicken has defeated Elmo. No! Yes! And the woobie is mine, for keepsies! The woobie is mine for keepsies The woobie is mine for keepsies The woobie is mine for keepsies for keepsies for keepsies. Give me those. Woobie is mine for keepsies Poor little Elmo. I simply can't see what's so special about this stupid blanket. Why didn't he just get a different one? Maybe he loved that blanket. Oh "Maybe he loved that blanket." Maybe he loved that blanket." - You don't know what you're... - Blanket! Elmo wants his Blanket back, now! That little piece of macrame lives! Blanket! - Pesties! Pesties! - Yeah, boss. Don't let him escape with my woobie! Ooh, that dirty rat. We'll get it, boss. Um, boss? Oh, brother. Where you going? Too, too high! Too High, too high! Hey, you let Elmo and his Blanket go! I don't think so. You and your blanket... ...are both mine now. - No! No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! Stop right there, you mean old Huxley! Zoe. Yeah, come on. We got him! - Elmo, are you okay? - Ah, you do have friends, huh? Don't they look sweet? I bet you all just have a grand old time together... ...just saying the alphabet and counting all day long. Mmm, yeah. It's over, Huxley. Get him! Huxley don't pay me enough for this! - What do you mean, "pay"? - Let's get out of here! - I want my mommy! - Give back my stinky socks! What? Grouches, cooperating? How are you going to get out of this one, Huxley? - I got a plan. - Oh, yeah? What? I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. Not very villainous, is it? They may save you, you annoying red monster... - but they can't save your woobie! - No, no, no. That's not a woobie! That's Elmo's Blanket! - Hold on, Elmo! - Be careful. That's it. - Slime bucket. - Yay! Wait a minute! Wait, wait! Where's Elmo's Blanket? No, no! Blanket! That's my Bug! Give me back my woobie! No, boss! You're nothing but a basket case! - What? - This blanket belongs to Elmo. Blanket! - Thank you, Bug. - You're welcome, Elmo. How... How could you do this to me? I thought we were friends. No. You're a greedy, selfish villain... ...and nobody likes to be friends with a greedy, selfish villain. Come on, Bug. Be a Bug, huh? I mean be a bug. Just for a second. But give me another chance. Let me give everything back. I'll give back all the yo-yos and all the Rollerblades... and all those bicycles, all the kids' toys, all the dolls, everything. I'll give it all back! Bug, Bug, I'll give back every single teddy bear. I'll give back the sun and the moon and the Earth and the stars. - I'll give it all back... - Less talkin', more givin'. You're not in your right frame of mind. This isn't when you make an important decision, Bug. Bug. Bug, listen to me. I was wrong. Oh, Blanket. This is great! Ha! Oh, thanks for helping, everybody. Elmo sure is lucky to have friends like you. - We're really proud of you, Elmo. - Yeah, way to go, Elmo. - You're one brave little monster. - Oh, thanks, Big Bird. Let's hear it for Elmo! Yeah. Let's go back to Sesame Street! I know a shortcut. Ready, guys? Let's go home, Blanket! Yay! - Oh, Zoe. - Hm? Um... Elmo's sorry for hurting your feelings. Can we still be friends? Well... Yeah. Friends forever. Yeah. Wow! - I can hold it? - Sure. What could happen? Together forever the world seems fine We never would ever leave you behind Together forever The world seems fine We never would ever. Leave you behind Elmo just wanted to say thanks for helping. Elmo couldn't have done it without you. Elmo love you. Bye-bye. Together forever the world seems fine. We never would ever leave you behind See, Bert? Just like I told you. - Elmo got his Blanket back. - Yeah, it's a happy ending. Yup. And thank you all for helping. Oh, yeah, yeah. You deserve a big round of applause. Oh yeah. Everybody clap for yourselves. Come on. - Come on. - You were great! Okay, Bert, time to go home. Yeah, I knew everything was gonna be okay. - Sure you did. - I knew Elmo would get - his Blanket back. - Yeah, right. I knew there would be a happy ending. - Of course, Bert. - See ya. Oh, look, look, look. Ernie, credits! Oh! I want to see who did the catering. That was really good toast. You know, they cut off the crusts and everything. Uh, Bert? Time to feed your pigeons. - Oh, oh, thank you. Bernice! - Bye-bye.
