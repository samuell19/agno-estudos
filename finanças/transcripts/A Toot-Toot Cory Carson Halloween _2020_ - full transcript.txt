A Cory Carson Halloween! Whoa! Those cobweb decorations look great! Cobweb decorations? Huh? Oh, those aren't decorations, honey. Ugh, we should clean more often. Are you sure it's going to be OK for Chrissy to go trick-or-treating without us this year? Of course. I know Cory and Freddie will take good care of her. But it's Halloween. It's so spooky out there! Woo! I'm a vampire, I'm a vampire! - Hm? - Hm? Boo! - Eugh! - Boo! Oh, Chrissy. That ghost costume looks so real. Very scary! - Don't worry. I'll get it. - Yay. You just go drink a glass of water and calm down. Beep, zorp. Hello, Mrs. Earthling Carson. Oh, Freddie! You look adorable! Thanks! Check this out! Beep, boop. Oh! Cory's gotta see this. Cory! Come look at Freddie's costume! Coming! Ugh! It's kinda hard to see where I'm going when I'm making my DJ Train Trax face. Phew. I dunno how he does that all day. Nice, Cory! Your costume turned out so good! Yeah, it looks great! Uh, I mean, greetings, Earth train. Please teach me what it means to boogie a woogie. My groovy space dude, that's a dance you do from your heart! Which one? I have three. So, you ready for all the candy we're gonna get tonight? Ready? Does this look like the face of someone who isn't ready? Whoa! Now don't you get so excited about candy that you forget to take Chrissy with you. Candy! Of course! I'd never forget about her! She's gonna help me carry all my candy! And do you remember our rule for tonight? Uh... Keep Chrissy safe! Oh, right! I knew that. Now let's go get some candy. Hola! Who's there? Oh! Trick or treat! Oh, how nice! I guess it's Halloween today. Carmina, do we have anything we can give the trick-or-treaters? OK. Here we go. Some nice treats to keep away the tricks. Nice! Uh, this doesn't look like candy. It's bread! Take as much as you like! Treats! Mm! Thanks? Trick or treat! Oh, wow! Great costumes everybody! Thanks, Carley! You, too! You look really scary. Uh, I'm not wearing a costume. D'oh! Uh, trick or treat? I'm giving out trading cards for the Backstreet Buses! Here, take your pick. Whoa! That middle one looks just like me! Ee! Don't you think? Uh, sure, Freddie. Trick or treat! Hi, Gary! Hey, everybody. Wow! Nice costumes! They deserve an extra special treat. One for each of you. What are those supposed to be? I made some dolls out of recycled things from work. Because being wasteful is the spookiest thing of all! Oh, cool. Man, these houses stink! Well, his name is Gary Garbage. No! I mean we've gone to all these houses and haven't gotten a single good treat! Where do I need to go to get some candy?! Cory, look! Huh? That's amazing! Oh, nice costume! Yeah, you too. Thanks! Happy Halloween! What costume was that supposed to be? Uh, DJ Train Trax. No! Huh?! What is it, Chrissy? Do you smell something?! - Treats! Yum! - Treats?! Treats, treats, treats! Where are the treats, Chrissy? A king-size candy bar wrapper! Wait! I think this is Frannie's house! Frannie! Open up! What do you want? Oh, I was just wondering if you wanted to share any of your candy. I saw the wrapper and-- Yeah, wrappers. All I got is wrappers. Frannie, wait! I was obsessed, Cory. I wanted that king-size candy bar so bad that I lost track. Lost track of what really mattered. Quit, Cory! Quit before it's too late! What? I just want candy. What are you talking about? Just won't let it go, will ya? You know how the scariest houses always have the best treats? Imagine just how scary a place has to be to give out a king-sized candy bar. It was the scariest thing I've ever seen, Cory. But if I really can't convince you, everything you need to know is up on the wall. Whoa! A map of Bumperton! And that must be where the king-size candy bars are! Uh, looks like it's all the way on the other side of town. Come on! Let's go get that candy. Candy! Just don't say I didn't warn you. Cory! Are you sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure. What's the big deal? We only have a little further to go. I don't know. Looks like a lot further to me. Well, looks like we'd better get going before they're all gone! Mmm... ♪ King-size candy Oh, that king-size candy ♪ ♪ It's not small It's really, really big ♪ It's really, really big! - King-size candy! - Candy! I'm pretty sure the map said it would be just up ahead. I think this is it! Whoa! Pumpkin! OK, we made it. Now let's go. Yeah, let's go. Uh, that's not what I meant! Welcome all ye who dare enter the haunted corn maze! Hi, mister! Are you the person we talk to to get the king-size candy bars? Ah, a brave-looking boy! Ye seeking the bar of kings ye be, first ye must pass all the challenges ye see! Enter the corn if you dare! Mm! Sorry, sometimes it gets stuck. There we go. I want my-- Mommy! Cool! Remember we said we'd keep Chrissy safe? Pumpkin! She seems fine to me. Now let's go. Cory, do you even know which way to go? Of course! Here we turn... uh... Right! Right! That's what I was gonna say. Phew. It's just a candy cone. We'll just go the other-- That wasn't there before, right? I don't think so. Hmm... Cory! Hey! I'm coming! That was a close one, Cory. See? I told you I'd keep you guys safe. Safe! As long as we stick together, there's nothing we can't-- Huh? Welcome, welcome! I'm Phil the spider! Let us through, Phil! We're gonna get the king-sized candy bar! If you want to pass, you must first answer my riddle. Oh! My mom loves riddles. Bring it on! Very well. In the mouth, I am chopped. Chop, chop, chop. At the movies, I am popped. Pop, pop, pop. In this maze, I was born. At the market, I am what? Uh, corn? It's definitely corn, right? Uh, wh-what? Impossible! I spent years thinking of that riddle! It was kind of easy. Corn! Very well. As promised. Hooray! - Yay! - Bye, Phil! OK, see you guys later. Mm, now it is I who must be riddled. Look, we're almost there! Ooh! King-sized candy bar, here we-- What the- Cory, I think we should head back now. No, we're in too deep, Freddie. Get behind me! What? OK! - Wait for it! - Cory! Duck! Great job! Tell your friends! Whoa! How did you know? Know what? We gotta keep moving. Come on. Uh... I think it's right up this way. Cory, wait up! Oh! Candy! Huh? Whoa! Cory, look! There it is! The king-sized candy bar! Wait! Cory, it's a red light! Red means don't go! Wow! What're you guys waiting for? This place is giving me the creeps, Cory! All right, all right. I bet it tastes king-sized. It even smells king-sized! Come on, Cory! Just grab it and go! Relax, Freddie. It's not like there's anyone-- Here? Take that! You think you're so scary? Ha ha! Can you believe we actually got it? - Wow! - Isn't it beautiful? Yeah! It's pretty shiny! What do you think, Chrissy? Should we eat it now or save it for... later? Chrissy? Chrissy?! Wait, where is Chrissy?! Cory, Freddie! Hi, Chrissy. Wiperglass! Remember you have an appointment on Tuesday. Tuesday! I'm all out of candy. But I think I've got some marshmallow treats inside. Marshmallows! Oh, I love Halloween! Chrissy! Well, gotta go! Come on, Freddie. We're going in. Chrissy! Oh, no, oh, no! Phew! Freddie, don't scare me like that! Sorry, Cory. Mm... Chrissy? Boo! Boo, boo, boo! This movie was horrible! Stay tuned for my scathing review! Hm. Where is it? I know I had a bag of marshmallow treats somewhere around here. Oh, now I remember! It's in here. Did you hear that? Sounds like Chrissy! What horrible things that monster must be doing to her! - Wee! - Oh! Look at you go! Marshmallows! Now that one looks like you, Freddie. Really? Hmm. Well, you are one happy-looking ghost. Halloween is so fun. All the happy children. Oh, Chrissy, come look at my special pumpkin stew I've been making. Oh, pretty! Ah, smells good too, doesn't it? Cory, look! The monster's gonna cook Chrissy! You know, I think it needs more nutmeg. Chrissy, could you grab me some? Thanks, Chrissy. It's right there on the bottom shelf. I had one job tonight. Keep Chrissy safe. Keep Chrissy safe! Wait! Come on, Freddie. Be brave. Be the brave alien! Be the brave alien! Hey, monster! Oh! Hello! - Let Chrissy go! - Oh! Chrissy! Oh, my stew! Oh, no! We're too late! She's gone! She's dissolved! She's nothing but soup now! Chrissy! Boo! Chrissy! You're alive! Or is it her ghost?! It doesn't matter! Run, Chrissy! Run for your life! Monster, don't eat us! Wait! You didn't get any treats! There. That should hold. Wait! Have some treats! This way! Wait! Children, the treats! There it is! Hey, hey! Open the gate! Hey, open the gate! Hurry! - - Mister! Mister, open up! - Oh, huh? Oh, OK! Oh, jeez. It's stuck again! Whoopsies, that's not good. Oh, no! Look, it's broken! What do we do?! Just go for it! Uh-uh! Scary! We made it! We made it! Chrissy! Ee! Huh? Cory, help! Treats! Have some treats! Come back! - Oh, no! - Wait! The monster's gonna eat Chrissy! Why is this happening? You must have some treats! It's all 'cause of this dumb old candy bar! That's it! Cory, if you do that, the candy bar will get crushed! I know, Freddie. I know. Careful, Cory! - Cory! - Wait, children! Cory, be careful! Chrissy! Come on! Ee! Chrissy! No! Run! Yay! Hurry! Uh, could you open the door please? Yeah. Um, just, er, give me a minute. Oh, do hurry. Those poor kids didn't get any treats! They must be starving! No kid should be empty-handed on Halloween! Treats for all! Bro... Forget it, bro. It's Bumperton. Wow, a glass of water really does help you calm down. Uh-huh. It's just the kids, honey. Right. Oh, man! Welcome back! Did you guys have fun? Y-Yeah. It was great. How about you, Chrissy? Did Cory keep you safe? Er... Chrissy safe! Phew! So how much candy did you all get? Uh... Marshmallows?! Marshmallows?! Marshmallows! Wow! Good haul, Chrissy! Whoa! Hey, since you've been such good trick-or-treaters, what do you all say to going to a spooky corn maze? I hear they have king-sized candy bars. Uh... Happy Halloween!
