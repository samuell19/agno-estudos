The land that I'd really like to live in is called childhood. I have a house there and people who really love me. They still do. What am I supposed to do with this? He's a poet. And I'm a lawyer. If he wants to stay in Germany, he needs a good reason. What reason? Well... war, repression? Torture, maybe? These reasons don't apply. What about my rights? You are German and you have the right to live wherever you want. So do I. You think I'm like you. Legally speaking, there are regulations in this country... which means that a difference between us... It wasn't a question. I'm not like you... but you are like me. Reference to autonomous law. Reference to autonomous law. Excluded jurisdictions. Excluded jurisdictions. Reference to autonomous law. Reference to autonomous law. Services. Services. Rules of jurisdiction. Rules of jurisdiction. Excluded jurisdictions. Member State. Member State. Member State. Member State. Territory... Territory of a Member State. Contract law. Contract law. Contract law. You may go in. Sorry, but this is an urgent matter. Please take that to court immediately. I'm sorry. The young one is in charge. The old man was afraid. Unbelievable how much you can find out under the table. A change of perspective from high to low normally brings new discoveries. Not bad, Michia. Coming from your lips, even bullshit sounds clever. Thank you. How is our poet doing? Mr. Ota... Ota Iba? Or: "The enemy would rejoice over me but God refused to allow it." Is this what his name means? That's why he was so damned rude. I want you to take his case. What case? He doesn't have a case. Don't you want to help the poor chap? Helping is all very well, but a Syrian mother with a child... I can make something out of that. I just like him. He seems nice to me. Imagine a boat full of people... women, children, men. They all want to come here. The boat capsizes. Whom do you help? Of course that's not you. You had a sea of possibilities. -So did you. The guy is right, but he's got no chance. Leaving your country, family, language and religion behind is a free choice. As natural as freedom of speech... so migration is a part of the fundamental human right... to self-determination. Who has the right to decide where someone else lives? While thousands of helpless people look for shelter in our country... my client isn't looking for my help. He refuses to be seen as a refugee... but instead he wants to exercise his rights as a free man... and choose where he settles. I don't want the case. Why not? I don't have to tell you why. I'm your boss. I don't have to tell you why not. I'm your friend. I'm working part time, so I have lots of time. Fuck off! History of art? -History of art. You know this joke? About Jozek and Franek working in Germany? -No... ...German control comes. Jozek has work permit and Franek... "...does your colleague have work permit?" asks the German. "Of course", says Jozek. "So call him to come over here". And then Jozek does this: "Franek, fuck off, fuck off!" Hello. Hello. For someone who's been dead for so long, you look pretty frisky. You look great. -I am great. Come in. You're a lawyer, right? Yes. I always thought you'd be a musician. I used to be. I played drums, but mother locked them in the basement. Was that enough of a reason to stop playing? I have to run, as my friend wants the car keys back. Stay here. You don't have your own car? -I do, a shared one. Is it cheaper that way? Better for the environment. -And cheaper. Yes, cheaper. OK, I'll wait. He has a face, a voice. Even a smell. He must have come by train. No... He's my father. How can you be so sure? You've never seen him before. I checked up on him before I agreed. I don't feel anything. Nothing here is from Poland. Don't you go there? I visit Mum's grave on All Saints' Day. Here you are. Grave? It's a mausoleum. Like your apartment. You want to be buried next to her? I never thought about it. Great. Do you have any pictures of her? I do. Can I see them? -No. Great. This dead man seems rather lively. How does it feel to be among the living again? How was your journey? Great, thank you. -Stop messing around. I like your dad. He is delighted to meet you. I dislike him already. Give him a chance, will you? He thinks you act strangely. What It was a joke. He didn't say that. I'm delighted to meet you. He is truly delighted to meet you. OK... so I'll take the stairs. Where's he going? He's taking the stairs. What He feels a little claustrophobic. He didn't like it? I think he just didn't get it, you know... Did you get it? Cheers! His stare is rather intense. Maybe he still thinks you're dead and is trying to understand it. Where do you work? Work He's not deaf. He just can't understand you. What do you do for a living? I'm a survival artist. What? He is a freelancer. Give him something more concrete. It doesn't have to be true. Concrete? Yes. Like, how do you survive exactly? Last year I worked as a music teacher in a primary school. But they found me too progressive. What did he say? He was a musician, very successful... and now he's trying to get things going again in Poland. Really? Great! Lovely! Whom do you need to defend to become stinking rich like you? What's our company profile like? International mergers, takeovers, representation... and selected pro bono cases... We make big deals but now help refugees, to do something good for society. I told him we also defend refugees. There was a time when Poles were refugees. There was a time when Poles were refugees. Tell your friend not to search in the past too deeply. There are many stories there. Poland has been badly mistreated in history. But we were not the only ones who suffered. How to say "übermensch" so he won't understand it? You're a totally different person when you speak Polish. Like a little boy. Are you really my father? I can't talk now. I'm in the meeting. I told you about it... It's busy here. I'll ring you back later when the meeting's over. OK? I promise. Stop it, you sick wanker. I'll be back as soon as I can. Who's the sick one, you lying arsehole? Why don't you come here and suck my dick? Come over here and I'll fuck a hole in your head! Wanker! I'm waiting for you! You're a real idiot. Hey, Michia! Remember, you don't owe him anything. I wanted to give you something, but you already have everything. Maybe I'll give you my watch? Nice. Vintage. But keep it. It suits you. I was looking at you yesterday. You're so different. And yet... the same as at your graduation ball. Did you go to my graduation ball? You were dancing with such a gorgeous blonde girl... A blonde? -She was beautiful. Where is she now? I have no idea. I lost contact with those people. Why? I live here. Not there. It's delicious, this German cream. "Sahne". Eggs."Eier". Spoon."Löffel". Water."Wasser". Tea."Tee". Butter."Butter". And so on. "Löffel", "Wasser", "Tee"... I've also got "Wurst". Would you like some? My cat ran away yesterday. I've looked everywhere for him. He's blind in one eye. When I woke up, he was lying in bed next to me. I'm glad I left the window open, and he could come in. I like it when you look at me like that. I'd like to stroke your hair one day. And what was the poem about? Have a nice day. It's a pity you didn't learn French. We would be in Paris now. On Montmartre. Why did you never try to contact me? I was dead, wasn't I? Your mum and I had an agreement. And after she died? I think I was ashamed. You're not ashamed now? A little less. And the Germans? What about them? They can't ignore me. And that's enough for you? It's a good start. So what's next? We will see. I always have swapped new adventures for old friendships. I guess, I'm like you. Do you have anything to smoke? You old hippie. No... punk! Punk. OK. Hugs. Michia... This is Alina. She's also Polish. You're a musician? Musician? No, I'm a lawyer. You've dressed up for the weekend? And you Whoever I want. I'm off to bed. I sent you my letter three years ago. Why did you wait so long? Why now? I'm sick. I want to die here. I always wanted to be an actor. But it didn't work out. See you. Good morning. -Good morning. It's going to be hot today. They're predicting 30 degrees. So that's how it will be. How old were you when you smoked your first cigarette? Six. Really? I was nine. What's written there? This place... overwhelms me. How much of yourself do you see in me? We both want a lot. All or nothing. But I just wanted to be a musician and you wanted to be a lawyer and you became one. You had the balls to do that. I'm proud of you. Mademoiselle... She likes you. Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Come back when you know. We won't have to talk at all. My father and I... were watching Westerns together. He even had a real cowboy hat... and he would wear it on Sundays. I thought he was the greatest man alive... like John Wayne. One day we were coming home... and I saw other kids laughing at him. It was the last time I went out with him... in that hat. I have to go to sleep. Can you give me some money? How much do you want? Two thousand? Let's sit down before the journey. I don't want to interrupt but my impression is that he has nothing to tell you. Hey! -Hello Michia. How was your weekend? -It was great! I survived! We went to Tiergarten, had a boat trip... TV tower, selfies -the lot! It was really great. Super. See you. Bye. Hello Michia. What's up? What's up? I want to take on the African poet's case. You turned it down. Yes... The guy annoyed me. He comes here, thinks he has our rights. He doesn't ask but makes demands. And on top of that, he's sarcastic all the time. That wasn't the reason you turned the case down. No, you're right. I'll tell you why. You thought it would look good in court for one immigrant to represent another immigrant. Of course it would look good. Maybe it has escaped your notice, but I'm German. Come on, Michia. Who wants to be German? I'm German. You're an immigrant. You see the differences between us... but you don't want anyone else to see them... except when it suits you. It's a nice game you're playing, but be careful I don't get tired of it. I want to take on the African poet's case. It's been taken by someone else. Who's taken it? I have. Our African poet has a lot of rich friends. They are paying our highest fee and want to make it big. You didn't tell me that. Yes. I knew it and I didn't tell you. Would that have changed your position? No, my perception. It would be different if I were in your place and you were in mine. That's the beauty of this country. You can try every day to take my place. No, thank you. Things are fine as they are. Hello, what are you doing here? Hello, you're not answering! Where do you want to go? Tell me, where do you want to go? Say something! Hello. May I come in? -Of course. Am I disturbing you? Did you get lost? No, why? You look lost. He's not lost. He just doesn't know. What do you want? What are you playing here? Pool! So it says here. BILLIARDS! -Yes. Is it funny? -Yes... Nice place you have here. Funny guy... Isn't he funny? What is wrong with him? Can I play? No. Let him through. He's crazy. Let him through. Excuse me. Why is the door closed? Can you tell me how to open the door? How can I get out of here? Hey, do you speak German? Do you understand me? Why is the upstairs door closed? So, what's wrong here? If you have a great imagination, you'll get it done. Then, experience is important. Hey there, are you crazy? Stop it! Stop it! What? Shit! I love this city. Were you born here? No, in Poland. A Pole? I wouldn't have thought that.
