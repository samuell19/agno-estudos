TODAY IS BAD BUT TOMORROW IS MINE THIS DOCUMENTARY WAS SHOT SECRETLY IN MADRID AND BARCELONA IN THE SPRING OF 1968 MADRID, 1937, UNIVERSITY QUARTER Madrid, how well you resist! Madrid, how well you resist! THE CIVIL WAR Madrid, how well you resist! Oh mother, dear! They laugh at the bombs They laugh at the bombs The people of Madrid laugh at the bombs The people of Madrid Oh mother, dear! The four generals The four generals The four generals Oh mother, dear! How mean they are! For Christmas Eve For Christmas Eve For Christmas Eve Oh, mother dear! They shall be hanged! MADRID, 1968, UNIVERSITY QUARTER PROTEST SONGS We knew of only one lord and watched as he became a cur. Debased by his gut, the love of his gut, by fear, bent by the whip, forgetting, mad, the reason that is his. Gnawed by disease, he still licked the hand the held him down in the mud. It would have been easy to make a wall out of his silence impenetrable, soaring: he chose the quiet shame of yapping. But we could not let ourselves despair of the beaten old man and raised in the night a song in shouts for words burst with meaning. For water, earth, air and fire are yours, if you dare to be who you are. Then you must say "enough" that you have the will to walk again with your head high, now and forever a man saved in the people, against the wind Saved in the people, master of all not a servile dog, but the only lord But we could not let ourselves despair of the beaten old man But we could not let ourselves despair of the beaten old man THE STUDENT MOVEMENT The university movement in Barcelona that in 1956 and 1957 carried out... a number of actions through free assemblies will undergo a very harsh repression that completely destroys these attempts at renewal. The main point was the creation of free assemblies where the university was discussed, and which were the starting point of the movement. first in Barcelona and then at the national level. We managed to fight off the attempt to transmit Fascist ideology to those generations that hadn't lived the war. Later, we saw that we had to do something. We couldn't wait for solutions to arrive, we had to create them. And that's when the idea to create a free, democratic, autonomous union came along It began in Barcelona in 1966 with the 'Capuchinada de Sarri?' Later on, it became a reality in Madrid and almost every Spanish university. This followed a change in orientation in 1956, where the regime resigned themselves to stop their proselytising at university, and it became a technocratic bureaucracy. It was broken up and disappeared in 1965. And with it went the professors who had taken a stance against repression Aranguren, Tierno Galv?n, Garc?a Calvo, among others. There has been a political awakening in Spanish universities of the critical situation the country is in. Not regarding its many social issues, but those of its very political institutions. The student knows he wants to be a citizen and he knows how to be one. The only way of participating in the political life of the country today is through protest For he has no legal way of joining in, in a way that is not that of protesting, In participating, organizing and distributing power. One must realize that the role of the university is no longer solely learning and teaching Nor merely to train students. The student lives the university as a civic object It integrates him in democratic society. Its inner life is a life of citizenship. It does not aim to substitute the professor or diminish him. It does not aim to modify intellectual hierarchies Its government is a common ground, where students and teachers meet as equals. As citizens of a society... where democratic principles are part of the university. The archaic university, where professors towered over students is antagonistic with the options of liberty that our youth needs. The government has clearly shown not to understand the student protests. It assumed that it was driven by no more... than a youthful inclination to rebellion. A sporty manifestation of violence that could not be otherwise channelled. It is, however, much deeper than that, and touches the university as a whole. What has been the government's answer? A controlled repression. In the general context of the country, the university is nothing more than a first symptom of generalised dissatisfaction. The protests are a concrete expression of what all of Spanish society wants. Not just as an intellectual, but as a European socialist militant I am obliged to list the reasons that drive our youth. Our youth wants the realization of a socialist society. A society without privileges. A society where equality reigns. A society that by its very definition is opposed to immorality. Our youth calls for a permanent principle, that accounts for all possible moral codes. Man should not be exploited by man. For it to be real democracy, it can't be restricted to formal democracy One like the French students have been fighting against. It has to have much loftier ambitions The movement has called for the end of the classist university. Statistics show that only about 1% of students... are the children of workers. Starting out from the analysis of the situation in Barcelona, there are two paths One, to politicize the students further, or to try and maintain coherent politics that addresses the needs of the students in order to have them join the union. The main goal that all Spanish students have is a Congress Where we'd have representatives from all districts of the country. And where we make a minimum program of demands, and goals for the movement. What we are trying to make... is not opposed to unionism or the democratic movement. But we consider that trade-unionism has merely a tactical value. And that we must respond to strategic challenges with the proper organizations, which are not trade unions. We must organize a student movement that takes into account both the trade union aspect as well as the need to further politicize not just the student struggle content, in new ways of struggle, in new paths. The predominant ideology of the movement is implicitly socialist. But there are different understandings of what socialism is there are social-democratic as well as revolutionary tendencies... they coincide in the goal of socialism, but have different paths to achieve it so the question is whether we get there through gradual reform or through a permanent autonomy of the popular movement and therefore a struggle not only against Fascist but Capitalist social structures. This ideology is the one that is currently becoming majoritary There's a general consensus in the goal for a Socialist society. According to economy data for the country for 1968 The budget of the Ministry of Education amounted to about 10% of GDP. Which amounts to some 4.5 USD per capita. The lowest in Europe, below Portugal and Greece. On the other hand, the Defence budget, divided between four ministries, Eats up some 20-25% of the State's budget. The change of Minister of Education is a consequence of the struggle of students who all over the country protested against the current structure. There's not a necessary link between the protests and the Minister's fall But the students in Madrid made it clear to the Dean that the Minister had to go and that police should be out of campus. Victories that strengthened the movement. I believe that this as far as it can go, as you cannot have real political change until you have general changes and the movement coordinates with other sectors. No, no, they won't make us budge! No, no, they won't make us budge! Maybe we should have much more systematic contacts... than what we have had so far. The struggle for Democracy in Spain must unite all, especially workers and students evidently under the direction of workers' organizations. WORKERS' COMMISSIONS [unintelligible/Catalonian] So in Catalonia, as in the rest of Spain, we spontaneously created Workers' Commissions, as the workers needed them. They struggle for workers' rights, union rights, and, ultimately, democracy There have been Workers' Commissions since the end of the Civil War. The Regime's unrepresentative official trade unions forced workers into creating these spaces to defend themselves They were spontaneous. It was much later that workers realized that this was a new tool of struggle, a new weapon. And from 1964 onwards they started creating branches Construction, printing, chemicals, transportation, all of it. The communists are in the Commissions as individuals Within them they do not defend the Party's platform but rather their personal convictions. The Commissions are a space... that allow for the defence of a number of issues which are not allowed in the State-directed union. In the country's politics, it represents a mirror of the feelings of all democrats. It is the dynamic force, the engine, of the democratic forces of the country. The working class, with this effort, is at the fore of the democratic struggle in the country A force that is palpable... when reading newspapers and court and police records that show that it is the most important and dynamic force in the country. In the summer we gave a show of solidarity and in these conditions we managed to organize 24h strikes in 40 businesses... ...40 factories In Barcelona, in Catalonia, we had hundreds of people arrested so we had to gather a lot of money for their bonds and to help their families No family of a detainee has had to go wanting for anything Thanks to workers' solidarity, even though they were also punished. No family has gone wanting for moral support. There were group visitations of comrades from the Commissions and even, in cases where there was pressure regarding the visits, we would gather at the prison's door to reassure them before they would go in and to send them messages... that they would soon be back with us. I went to see my soon in prison and to bring him some food WOMEN IN FRONT OF THE FACTORY because they don't get enough of it. It's not enough food for an 18-year old that has already spent 3 months there for bringing food to people detained for social reasons, the factory workers for defending the workers. I come to the prison 3 times a week to visit my husband He was arrested after talking to friends about the problems here that there are 50.000 children with no school to go to. that we lack water, the doctors are very far away... and the police came and arrested them. As a consequence of being elected by the workers, with 90% of labourers, and 85% of technicians, the State Union has annulled the elections though they notarised the results. That didn't help. Many provincial and local union reps are in the same situation as my brother. The repression is brutal. The police is always after them. I went to see my boyfriend in jail, a comrade. He was unfairly arrested at the demo, after the elections... He's 18, just another young man, a member of the Commissions, like me. We fight for our interests, but there's this brutal repression of young people Women in the Workers' Commissions are one more part of the working class. We are in the same situation of oppression and injustice as the rest of the workers And even more as women, conditioned because of the culture imposed on us instead of being a housemaker, we have to bring our qualities to the movement. We have links to all democratic forces in the country. Besides political parties with underground trade unions, with religious groups... with lawyer groups, teachers, priests, doctors, students and this is where all these forces, this stream of democratic forces, meet. Understand that we are in a country where, first of all, Fascism doesn't evolve, Fascism repulses social strata around it that are not quite the classical ones. Today, many groups in the country are affected. Not just the workers We must join with them against this common enemy that blocks the democratic evolution of our country. And that is why it is a mistake to isolate from the rest of democratic forces... and take a radical stance that would only strengthen and prolong Francoism. The current situation of Spain depends on many factors This country has always had struggling opposing poles We are all marked by the Reconquista... In Spain the more reactionary side has always won. And we have a Church that sides with the right the right of landowners, aristocrats, rentiers, industrialists and the military. All these elements have constituted the country's superstructure. But it has started to realize its true evangelical mission and priests their duty as men. They live and share the troubles and feelings... of the people and live with it WORKER-PRIESTS with a social conscience and something that is almost a class conscience. Calling us 'working-class priests' is not quite right We are only workers inasmuch as we must earn our living But we also have enough free time to give to our communities. This is not a premeditated experience, but rather an issue of personal honour. The Spanish state pays the priests a monthly stipend, which is not something ecclesiastically sound so we have begun in many places, 3 or 4 years ago, to put things in their place. But any religious action has, automatically, a political reaction And the hierarchy, that would seemingly accept the refusal of these privileges, once enough priests and believers are for it. Spain is a country with good relations with the Vatican and a stable country, dictatorial that it is. After the treaty with the Vatican, it joined the UN and agreed to host US military bases. In the treaty with the Vatican, the Civil War is recognized as a Crusade supported by most Spanish bishops. And they have such influence they are surprised we follow a different line from that of our superiors Maybe it's because of these new priests that have us believe myths. I heard of a 25 year-old girl who was convinced that priests didn't piss! - After mass a girl asked a colleague if he had to walk very far to Rome - The Vatican is getting farther by the day! The Vatican is trying the same as some bishops in Spain, A renewal. But it starts over false premises. The question is not whether to renew seminaries, but whether they should exist! The problem of reform is to paint over something rotten. It goes nowhere. We need radical change. They think we are stronger than we actually are! They fear us more than they should. We are only beginning. It's only the start. There is no link between workers' groups and priests And I don't think there should be one. We shouldn't become another collective. Each may have their opinions, but we shouldn't be a pressure group. We shouldn't be given too much importance. We are not like the French worker priests who have reflected on workers' reality. We don't have that. We are a few people who share some problems but that make up no coherent front. For words burst with meaning. For water, earth, air and fire are yours, if you dare to be who you are. Then you must say "enough" that you have the will to walk again with your head high, now and forever a man saved in the people, against the wind Saved in the people, master of all not a servile dog, but the only lord But we could not let ourselves despair of the beaten old man But we could not ourselves despair of the beaten old man TODAY IS BAD BUT TOMORROW IS MINE Antonio Machado
