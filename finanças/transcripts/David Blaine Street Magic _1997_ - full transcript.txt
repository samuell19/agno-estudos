What I want you to do is, from in this deck, I want you to try to see one card. Not this one, but look closely. Try to see one inside. Did you get one? Here. I'll do it again. It might have been too quick. Try to see a card inside, if you can. Did you see one? You think you did? Don't say it. Just hold it in your mind. I know this is not it, but visualize your card right here. This is Times Square. Here, there's no boxes, no stages, no sets. Nothing. Just people, and me. Let me just try this thing. I don't even-- To be honest with you, I have no clue. Hold this box. I honestly doubt that I'll be able to even do this one. No, look. Take one. Take one out. Okay. Show it to them. - You got it? - Yeah. All right, look. Put it back. - Put it just right on top? - Yeah, you can put it here. Look, we'll cut it inside, okay? - Like this, all right? - Yeah. And then we'll put these into the box. - Just like this, all right? - Okay. Right in the box, okay? Hold the box lightly towards the bottom. Right here. Lightly. Just think of your card. Hold it looser, but don't let it fall to the ground. Just looser. Yeah. Let go even more. Just don't let it fall to the ground. Keep thinking. Okay, hold it on the sides even. - [whimpering] - Yeah, keep thinking. Keep thinking. - Look, one card-- - No way. Look at the one card that's protruding the most. - Looser. Even looser. - [laughing] - And looser. - [muttering] - I'm going into labor. - Look. Look. Look. Take it out. Don't drop it. Aaahhhh... - That's your card? - Yes. [David] Okay. From in the deck, any card that you want, you're gonna be allowed to take. Take one. Good. Show it to them. Let everybody see it. - [laughter] - You got it? Oh, do me a favor. Write your name on the face of it also. - Here? - Uh-huh. [laughs] Good. Great. Now, you could put the pen-- Or, actually, here. Just say-- say "stop." - Stop. - Stick it in there. Here's part number one. Ready? The first part. Even though you put your card in the middle, and you wrote your name on it so I could not cheat. Hold your hand out. Part number one is your card jumps up. [laughter] Stop that! Here's part number two. Part number two is your card is the two of clubs with your name. There was a reason that you took this card, am I right? Yeah. Um, you also wrote your name on it. I mean, we have to go back in time for a second. Let's do something with it. - Let's just rip it up a little bit, okay, Brandy? - Okay. - Look. Across your name, at least, right? - Yeah. - Just like that. - Uh-huh. Here it goes. Ready? If I just rub it... Hold the deck. I'll try to just do this just right. Squeeze. Squeeze tight. - What? Squeeze what? - No. Like this. See? - Where'd it go? - I have no clue. It's the top-of-the-deck card. [Women squealing, laughing] [muttering] Torment somebody else for a while! You can keep the deck. It's for you. - It was nice meeting you, guys. - Thank you. - Bye. - Take care. - Bye. - [laughing] [Leonardo DiCaprio] Yo, David, you remember when you did magic for me for the first time? - Yeah, at some party? - Yeah. Well, at that point I was particularly uninterested in magic. I mean, it really did nothing for me. I mean, I'm so used to seeing these big special-effect shows, you know, where they make some huge object disappear, or they do some, you know, ridiculous stunt. But when you did magic to me, you know, at that party, it was right in front of my face. Was, you know, one-on-one. I couldn't help but be interested again. So, why are you now doing a TV special? I mean, I'm curious. How do you think your stuff is going to translate? It's so different than what's been done before. I wanted to present a different kind of magic than people are used to seeing on TV. I don't work with fancy props. There's no beautiful showgirls. There's no elaborate sets. I work with people. That makes the magic spontaneous. ♪♪ [hip-hop] So, here we are. We're in Dallas, Texas. [Southern accent] Dallas, Texas. We're going to go find as many cowboys as we can. Not cowboys like you think.

[Woman chuckles] Um, let me ask you something, all right? - Listen to me. - Okay. Just think of a number between one and 50. - Okay. - But listen. Before you do that, to make it interesting, use odd-- odd digits for each digit, but use different digits. - Okay. Done. I got one. - So think of a number between one and 50, - ...odd digits, for each digit a different digit. - Got it. Done. - You got it? - Got it. Wait. Does it have to fit on a card? - No, no. Just-- Yeah. - Oh, no, you can't. You can't. - You have it? - Yep. Uh, it's difficult with all this noise. 37? You're really incredible. That's really weird that you can-- Are you psychic or what? Because I totally believe in like, you know, that there's a lot of stuff we don't understand, and we only use three percent of our brain, and... Wow. I really feel like you're reading my mind. Now you're freaking me out. 37. Wow. - Think of a number between one and 50-- - Okay. ...but use odd digits for each digit, but use different digits. So, a number from one to 50, odd digits for each digit, but different digits. All right. Done. - 31. - Wrong. - What was it? - 39. 39? You want to know the weirdest thing? - What? - Watch this. You thought of 39? - Mm-hmm. - I'm willing to bet my life that you have exactly 39 cents in your pocket. Take it out and count it. Let them see. Come here. See how much change she has. Change. I don't know how much I have. 25, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. - How did he do that? - [laughing] Think of a card. Think of a card. Not the ace of spades. You have a card? And think of a card. Not the ace of spades. But think of any card you want. Come here. Stand next to each other right here so I can just pick up-- Ready? You're thinking of a card? Yes. - Jack of clubs. - [bleep] - [laughter] - Watch. Ready? Hold on. You're thinking of a card also? Oh, my God. - Queen of diamonds. - Right. [laughter] - You got one in your mind? - Uh-huh. - You got one? - Mm-hmm. - Good. Hold it in your mind. - Okay. - It's in there. - It's red. Mm-hmm. - It's a heart. - [chuckles] Mm-hmm. [laughing] It's big. - It's the jack of hearts. - Right. Whoa! [laughs, mutters] - You got a minute? - Yeah, what you got? I'll show you something. Look. Hold this. - Just think of a card from inside. - Okay. I'm gonna mess with your mind a little bit, all right? - All right. - Not the ace of spades. Nothing common. - That's exactly what it was. - Yeah. I'm going to mess with your mind. - Very good. - I told you that. Do it again. This time, visualize your card turning over, man. - See it turning over. - Okay. - You did it? - Yeah. Name out loud the card that you tu-- You're holding the deck the whole time. Name out loud the card that you turned over. - Ten of diamonds. - Look inside, right? - Check this out. One card-- - Yes. ...is different from all the others, right? If you did this right. I mean, I don't know what your potential to move-- Here. Look at that card. See what that is. That is unbelievable. That is just terrific. How'd you do that? How'd you do that? It's so mind-boggling. I'm going to show you one that's crazy, man. I don't even know what to say about it. Here. Look, man. Forget this. We'll take a few of these away. It's driving me nuts. I don't know about how you feel. - We're going to take a few away. - You're so relaxed. How are you relaxed? Do you know what you're doing? This is worth thousands of dollars. That's great. I gotta go. I gotta go. Whatever this man's name is-- I think it's Dave? It's mind-boggling. It's amazing. It's real. I just walked up. And I came from the welfare department. I have nothing. He's offered me nothing. He just says, "I want to show you something." What he showed me, to me-- I'm 50 years old. It's mind-boggling. I don't care if he makes a million, if he starves to death. It doesn't make a difference. It's mind-boggling, whatever it is. [people exclaiming] Just levitated. Coming up, David Blaine will levitate. From in here, I want you to try to think of one. But you have to see one. So look at the cards, okay? - Not this one. Ready? Look. Try to see one. - Okay. - Okay. - Did you see one? It wasn't too fast? - Mm-mm. - Do you have one in your mind? Yeah. Look. This is not it. See? Look. - Mm-hmm. - That's not it. - Mm-hmm. - I know that. Hold that. - Okay. - By your reaction to that card-- Here. Give me the rest. By your reaction to that card alone, I know that your card was red. By the way you looked at the card, I know that your card was a diamond, see. Now we take it to the next step. What if I told you that when I gave you that card that I said wasn't yours, I made you see something that really wasn't there? Wow. I would freak out just like I did there, -I'd scream again. -Look at the card that I gave you. - Look at it, turn it over. - Wow, this can't be it! Oh, my God! You're amazing. Are you a guru of some kind? Are you a guru? Am I going to have success in Los Angeles? I just moved here. Excuse me. Do you work for the hospital? I'm a medical student. You are? You're studying medicine? Can I show you one thing that transcends the mind? Look. Real quick, it's okay. No, look, look, look. You'll like this. No. Do the people ever think you're just some freak when you come up and do magic to them, or are they always really responsive? No, sometimes I'll walk up to somebody and just be like, "Can I show you something?" And they won't know what I'm going to do, so they'll just be-- They'll just be like, "Get out of here, I don't want to see it." [laughs] - You have one second? - No, that's okay. Right, but look. You don't have two seconds? - Can I show you ladies some magic? - No, thank you. Oh, you might like it, though, it's really good. I've been doing it since I was four years old. We were working in Vegas last, but now we came to Atlantic City. You sure you don't want to see one thing? - No. - It's free. No, no, I don't like magic. [gasps] Here's a card. This is-- This is your card, the three of diamonds. You wrote a little mark on it over there? - Yeah, right. - Now look, put your other hand on top of the three in a sandwich manner, just like that. A sandwich manner? Yeah, put your other hand on top. Yeah, yeah. - Oh, oh, I see. - Just so I can't take the three of diamonds out of your hand, - even though you marked it. - Oh. -And we also use the four of clubs. -Mhm. My idea is to get the four of clubs to travel. Look. See the three with the mark? Just jumped out. Look inside of your hand, though. You had it in your hand. - I had it in my hand, right. - Yes. [laughing] Gee, how did you do that? That's the magic. - The whole deck? - The whole deck? The whole deck. Do not drop the whole deck. Hey, do the one with-- where I had a-- when you changed them two aces. All right. All right, so who's going to go with me? - Now do him. - George. Go ahead, do George. [all speaking at once] What are we doing? So, what you're going to do is you're going to take one card out, right? - I'm going to take a card? - Yeah. - Okay. - So go ahead, take a card out. Show it to everybody, let everybody see. [all speaking at once] Let him see it. Let him see it too. He don't want to mess with me. My cousin Guido's out here. - You got it? - Yeah. Say stop. It doesn't matter. Here, I can see the eight. I mean, it doesn't matter that I saw it. It doesn't make a difference, eight of spades. Hold your hand out, like this. Here's where it gets important. Look. You can see the card? Here's what we'll do. Put your other hand on top, like a sandwich, like that. And watch, remember this card, as well. Ten of hearts. Watch the ten, ready? This one's good. If you just rub it. See? It changes. There's the eight. Look in your hand, look in your hand. Turn it over, open it up. [all cheering] I give up. Excuse me. Can I sit here? Look. Take one out. Don't let me see it. Show it to mommy, and show it to the camera. Good. Take it. Yeah. Show it to them, show it to them. Just what I was thinking of. That's the one you were thinking of? All right, Peyton, look. Put it back into the deck. - In, in, in. - Inside, in the middle. Ready? - Okay, ready for this, Peyton? - Uh-huh. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to watch closely. I'm going to get your card to leave. Your card's going to vanish. Do you believe me? - No. I don't believe you. - I think it will. Look, I'm not sure if it will, but I think it will, hold on. I think this is it, but let's see if we can get it to go, hold on. Oh, that's not it. Watch this, ready? Boom, that becomes it. Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait. Peyton, watch. Look, look, look, here it goes. Ready? Your card is going to vanish again, ready? I shake it. See? It's gone. You know where it went, Peyton? [Peyton's Mother] How did you do that? Did you feel me touch anywhere on your body? - No. Right? - No. Not your hair, not your seat, nothing. No. Reach into your back pocket. Go ahead. - Do you feel anything? - Oh! [laughing and screaming] Oh, my God! Let's take out-- No, let's take out two aces, okay? Right here, these two, these two, these two. Forget this one. Hold those. Look, touch the back of any card that you want. - Which one? This one? - Yes. Right here? Do you want to keep it or change it? - Keep it. - All right, you can all see it? You can see his card? Look, watch what I do. Right away I know where it is in the deck. It's 24th. I'm not holding any funny breaks, nothing. Here's what I do. I take these two aces. Watch closely. Look. I'm going to try to cut. Where did I say it was? 24? So, look, I cut 24 cards like this, right? It comes out. Shoots to here, and it lands. [laughs] [Man] What the-- What? That's it. That's the card. - I get to write my name on it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I'm going to go like this. I'm just going to go like that. [David] I'll tell you what. Just, can you snap? You know how to do it? Yeah, okay, every time you snap, your card's going to jump from the middle of the deck right up to the top. So which card do you want? - The nine of diamonds? - Yeah. Put it face up here, so you can write big. Write your name big on the card. Yeah. - Cool. - "Froot Loops." Now, this is your name. I mean, I couldn't possibly replicate that. Is that your name? That's perfect. Yeah. Hold it? No, no, look. In the middle, right? - Is that the middle? - Now, well, I mean I'm estimating, but let's give or take a few, that's about middle. Would we agree on that? About? - I guess so, yeah. - Look. Here it comes, ready? Snap your fingers right over it. - Done. See? - Wow. He's good, right? He's good, right? Watch, watch again look here. His card, your card. Look, pick up about half of the deck. Go ahead. "Fruit Loops," pick up about half. Your card in the middle, the rest go on top. - [laughs] - Done. Wait a minute, let me put that card in the deck. No, watch again, I'll leave it. Watch. Look, look, look. Here's his card with his name, I promise, look. Now look. I tell you right now, I'm assuming-- Look, here's his card, I'm assuming this is about middle, but this time, so you know what's going on, I'm going to leave it sticking out, so you can see his name. I mean, I couldn't cheat and duplicate that. - That's his name. - That's his name. Here it goes, This is-- I'm counting now. This is about 12 cards down, plus another ten. So 22, here it comes. No, no. Snap, snap it up. That's the move, see? - Nah, you're a bad man! - He's good, right? You dangerous! Come here, stay here. I want you to see it one more time. [all speaking at once] One more time. Stay here, look, look, look. Let's bend his card, right? Like this. It's bent, now you can see the card. I mean there's a pretty major bend in it, look. The cards go right on top of it, ready? Watch this. "Froot Loops." - Oh, you psychopath. - That's awesome. [all laughing] I have a brand new deck of cards for you. I want you to open the deck. I want you to thoroughly examine it. I want you to shuffle it face up. Remove the jokers. Can I have a sharp knife to cut this open, please? [Man] Give me a sharp knife, please. Like a steak knife. Good. [Man] Oh, thank you. Perfect. Oh, you opened it already? - No, not really. - Okay, you can just cut it. - Like that. - Okay. Open up the box. Take the jokers out. Get rid of them. Examine the deck. Good. Get rid of all of them. Yeah, that's perfect. Shuffle them face up, so everybody can see-- - Face up? - Yes, face up. Shuffle them thoroughly. Good. Great. [chatter] That's fair. What I want you to do is I want you to spread them on the table, just like this. - Here, I'll do it for you. - Okay. I'm going to turn my head. I want you to reach in, and remove any card that you want from the deck, any single one. Take it out. And then you're going to show it to them, and show it to everybody, and then shuffle it back into the deck. I'll turn my head. - Hold it steady? - Show it to them. Let them see it too. Let everybody see it. Let everybody see it, and shuffle it back into the deck thoroughly. [Man] Let me see it. Yeah. Let everybody see it. - I didn't see it. - Let me see it. Good. And shuffle the deck thoroughly. Mix it up. So there's no way that I can follow your card, shuffle it face down. - There's no way. - Perfect. I don't know where your card is. Spread the cards over the surface of the entire table. Mix them all around, everywhere. Everywhere. Good, big. Bigger. All across the whole table. I don't know which card is yours. But just to make it even more difficult, I'm going to cover the cards. Can I have a menu or something? Is there-- can I have a menu? [Man] Can we have the menu? Yes. Good. Just to make this more impossible, we take a menu, one of the menus, pull it out like this. We don't need the plastic. But here's what happens. The menu goes over the table, just like that. Watch. Ready? This knife. Ready? Look. [screams] Ugh! Look. See? There's a card there-- See that card? - See there's one card? - Yeah. - Look. - That's it? What name your card? - [laughs] - That's it. Wait, how did you do that? Let me do it again. Hold up. Let me try it with you. Now watch his wrist. Hold this. Hold this. All right, ready? Name a number. Make it bigger, though, 'cause his was too hard 'cause I-- - All right. 13. - All right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. See? As soon as you connect them, that's what happens. Where's the cards? - Oh, they switched up. - See what I'm saying? It switched from hand to hand. Yeah. What he do? Look, check it out. Watch, like this. Ready? Look, look, look, watch. Watch this move. Just watch this move. - Look. No, no. - [speaking indistinctly] Look, look, look. Watch. Here's the switch, right? - It's right here, right? - All right. See the--? That's the move, right? Yo, I'm going to give you something. Hold this. I got something for you, man. I got a little-- Here, a little treat. Like a present for you. [all laughing, clapping] Thought you lost it. [all laughing, chatting] I hope this time works, sir. Oh, my God. Give me my watch back. [all laugh] Out of all of these, right? Any card that you want, you can have, right? It's fair to say? Here we go. Watch. Take one out. Take one, don't let me see it. Which one? Show it to them, show it to them. Here, take the deck. Mix it into the deck. Mix it up into the deck. [Man] Oh. [Woman] That's it. That's it, man. On the other side of the glass, bro. [woman laughs] - How is it? - Oh, my God. [laughs] Okay, now, wait. First of all, the first one that was in my mind, he really guessed. That was real. I think he's not natural. For real. I think he-- I never believed in psychics, and this isn't a commer-- [laughs] I don't care. I don't even care. I'm telling you. He picked the card that was in my head, and... that was real. Hold on, wait. [rock music] - How did he do that? - I gotta see that again. Oh, my God, dude. - Wait, do that again. - All right, wait. [Announcer] Stay tuned to David Blaine Street Magic. David will perform a real levitation. [people speaking and laughing] Yo, I want to see that quarter. [all speaking at once] Do you levitate and all that? I don't know if I could-- You know what? I was once able to do a levitation, but I got sick out of my-- Let me try this. Stay right there, don't move. Let me just try this. Stay right there. I don't know if I'll be able to get off, man. It's kind of hard to. Ready? ♪♪ [reggae music] - Yo! - Dude! Dude! He just levitated. Did you miss that? No way. [all speaking at once] [David coughing] [Man] Levitate, levitation. He just-- he levitated off the ground. [Woman] I wanna see it. I wanna see him do it again. I know I saw his feet up, but I didn't know if... - Thanks so much, man. - I'm gonna tell y'all something. The brother's into-- He's into that spiritual stuff, man. - That-- Seriously, man. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I seen a movie on it, man. [all laugh] No, I'm dead serious. Can you see my feet? Don't move. Watch. [women screaming] [chatter] Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - My God. My heart is pounding. Ooh, I'm scared. Mm. Ooh... [Leonardo DiCaprio] Some of the biggest reactions I've seen have come from your levitation, and I know it's my favorite stuff, because you can simply do it anywhere. I mean, you don't use wires or rigging of any kind. It's a spontaneous thing, you know? That's the strongest way to affect somebody with magic. You just show them something they cannot fathom is possible. Just hold. Come over here, X. Hold your hands like this, just in case I come back. - Like this? - Just stand, stand-- Yeah, but maybe closer over here. Together, yeah. Just like that. Yeah, just stay kind of close. Ready? Here we go. All right, I don't think I'll land on you, guys. Hold on. Watch. Here we go. Be careful. I don't know. I don't know if I'll be able to get off, man. Ready? Just if I fall, just catch me, man. [thud] [laughing] - Come on, brother. - Come here, Lisa. - Yeah, he played it off. - You all right, man? [Man] What'd he do, Deon? What did he do? He came off the ground, but I can't believe that, man. I'm going. I got to get home and take a nap. [Man] But how high? I-- I got-- I got to go and take a nap. Mike got to see this one, man. - Hey, you got my money. - Hey, that there-- How was the magician? He coming off the ground, saying... That was it for me, man. I got to go home and take a nap after this. Do you want to see something that I find a little bit strange? - Sure. - You don't find this strange? - This isn't-- - I do. What I find strange is an ability-- Stand closer together, in case I fall over. [all laughing, speaking indistinctly] Watch. Oh, my God! [all laughing and screaming] Oh, my God. I saw that movie... [laughing] Let me tell you, he just rose himself off the ground. He's floating. He was floating. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. I could see if I had a few drinks, but-- He floated. He got up in the air. His feet lifted off the floor. His feet just left the ground. We didn't know what he was going to do. All of the sudden, he just popped up. Trust your new friend joke where you just fall backwards. He just lifted. [Man] Can you tell how high off the ground? - I'd say like that, yeah. - Six inches, at least. [Man] What did he want you to do? [all scream, laugh] This man is not-- He's not right. He floated. - He's not right. - He floated. That's all. He floated. That's all. Did you see him float? Did you get him float? 'Cause he floated. It wasn't no TV scam. He floated. I think it's, like, you just get a gut feeling, and like-- 'Cause I've read up on this stuff, some of it. And it's just like, he came back and I was like, "Are you all right?" He was like, "Yeah, I'm fine." He's from somewhere else. He's probably an alien. - This ain't right. - He's from another planet. This ain't right. I guess he's very gifted. To me, like, spiritually, very gifted, but, like, I think meditation wise, he really, like, he can do it. I mean, that was unbelievable. I mean, there was, like, no strings attached. And he just, all of the sudden, he came up off the ground and he came back down, but he was like-- That's just-- Wow. He didn't have nothing to hold on to. There's something wrong with this picture. I can't believe this man. This is a shock. That man made my heart beat fast. That's-- that's-- that's nice. I'm never going to forget this day. And it's my 18th birthday. A man floated on my 18th birthday. I'm never forgetting this day. [laughter]
