come on. let's go. now, learn something good today. I'll make you porcupine meatballs for dinner. yeah! yeah! all right. whoa! whoa! lunch! lunch! here you go. good-bye kiss! bye, mom! bye! bye. President Reagan took the opportunity to once again characterize the Soviet union as america's greatest enemy, calling it, "the focus of evil in the modern world." the president later visited... can I have one? to discuss support for his strategic defense initiative, the space-age laser technology intended to protect america from any and all aggressors. during the meeting at the hill, President Reagan dismissed critics of the u.s. marine presence in Lebanon, saying the mission's goals are clearly defined and that the u.s. personnel are in control of the situation. hi, Gerri, Doug. shall we? did it clear up? yes. good. it was so gray when I came in. uh, excuse me. good morning. good morning, Dr. peck. I need to have a word with Mrs. Anderson, if you don't mind stepping into my office. both of us? no, no. this will only require you, Gerri. o.k. here, have a seat. I apologize for the disorder. oh, we have two kids. I know all about disorder. yes, i'm sure. so how would you assess your counseling right now, Gerri? how's it going for you? oh, well, um... what's that saying about baseball? you don't get into last place all of a sudden. you do it one game at a time. it's been hard. Doug doesn't really like to talk, so it takes time. he was that way with Larry, the other counselor, but I think that he's a little bit better with Judith. Gerri, have either you or your husband thought about seeing Judith outside the center? do you think we need to? no, no. i'm just wondering if you have. no. we come here once a week, and we talk to Judith here. why? what's the matter? is she moonlighting on you? seeing clients on the sly? I can't help noticing that you're not smiling. I am the administrator of this facility. I take my responsibilities very seriously, but those responsibilities are finite. it is not my job to supervise the activities of my staff once they leave the premises. you're a busy guy. nothing like this has ever happened before. nothing like what? just now, you weren't asking if Doug and i were seeing Judith. you were telling me that Doug is seeing Judith, right? when things are brought to my attention-- what sort of things? certain potentially inappropriate things. somebody saw them together. is that it? Doug and Judith? where? where were they seen? I just want you to understand my position. oh, I understand. why did you think we were coming here? because we were just getting along too well? i'm sorry. so where were they seen? at the movies? at a restaurant? going into a motel? coming out of a motel? what I do kind of depends on what you tell me. great. like I said, nothing like this has ever happened before. maybe not to you. (door closes) Gerri! Gerri! what are you doing? walking home. but that's 35 miles. yeah. you can't walk 35 miles. how do you know? I never tried before. get in the car, and we'll talk about it, o.k.? talk about what? about what happened. what happened, Doug? let's just get in the car. if somebody comes along, I could get a ticket, and, believe me, I do not need another ticket. you slept with our marriage counselor! you want to talk about this? we'll talk in the car. we were supposed to talk to the counselor. what? she didn't understand the idea of sleeping around, so you had to demonstrate it for her? just get in the car, Gerri. I'll drive you home. I'll drive you back to the center. I'll drive you anywhere you say if you'll just get back in the car. no. I don't want you driving me anywhere anymore. what is that supposed to mean? that means that I am done! no more making up both sides of the conversation. no more trying to explain to our kids where you are when you're not there! whenever we change shifts at the factory, I work late. I explained that. oh, I know that. you're very good at explaining things, but that's part of the problem, isn't it? every time I swallow one of your excuses, I lose a little piece of myself, and I can't do that anymore. so that's it. no more. no more. you've got a lawyer? no, but I know where the yellow pages are. o.k., then. o.k. you don't have to sound surprised, mom. it's been a long time coming, like a freight train. well, you know, I don't know how that works yet, mom. this is my first divorce. o.k. yeah, you know what? I'll call you over the weekend when the rates go down. kiss dad and tell him not to get angry at anybody. all right. I love you, too. bye, mom. (boy) see you, Jake! see you! (different boy) bye, Austin! hey, Matt, Jake... we got to talk. (man) Mrs. Anderson retains the house and contents, except for Mr. Anderson's personal belongings. Mrs. Anderson assumes the mortgage and responsibility for the associated expenses of the house. Mrs. Anderson retains custody of the minor children, but Mr. Anderson will have reasonable visitation. Mrs. Anderson waives all claims to alimony, and Mr. Anderson agrees to pay child support for the minor children, payments to be made monthly. I thought that you invited more people over than just us. I did. well, what happened? I don't get it. I didn't know a lot of people when we moved here. most of my friends were wives of the guys Doug works with. I guess it's awkward or something. I don't know. Doug and Tom do a lot of stuff together. i'm over, and I don't feel awkward at all. Gerri, are you o.k.? i'm divorced. hi. hi. I like our old supermarket better. the new one's a thousand miles away. I still like the old one. "f-i-n-a-l." thank you. oh, i'm starting to hate envelopes with little tissue-paper windows. can I have a pop? drink water. pop's made out of water. it's practically the same thing. (adding machine whirring) this month's lucky winner is... the gas company. (knock on door) hey, where are my troops? there they are! there they are! hey, you guys all ready, huh? yup! did you brush your teeth? let's see. hey, how's it going? we have to talk. what, now? well, it's important. yeah? I didn't get a check this month. are you going to start in on this again? i'm not the one who's late. I'll write you a check on Monday. you're supposed to write it on the 15th. I said I'd write it Monday. do you have your checkbook with you? no, I don't have my checkbook with me. I didn't think you'd charge me to see my kids. this isn't blackmail, Doug. I depend on that money. you can't be late with it all the time. i'm not late all the time. a lot of the time. I said I'd send you a check on Monday. is that a promise? what? you want me to cross my heart or something? no. I would like you to get the check here on time. yes, Doug Anderson, please. his wife-- ex-wife. uh, yeah. well, can somebody give him a message, then? tell him to call me-- call Gerri. it's important. if I could reach him at home, I would, but I can't, so I am calling him at work. well, can someone please leave him another message? thank you. (slams phone) (Gerri) I asked for more hours at work. they say they can't. I call Doug at home. he never picks up. I call him at work. they say they can't find him. the checks aren't late. they're just not coming at all. well, what are you going to do? he's coming over on Saturday to see the boys. I get to ask him for money in front of Matt and Jake, which always makes me feel about 10 feet tall. oh. Suzy, does Tom talk to him? to Doug? do they see each other? I don't know. (imitating explosions) what time is it now? the clock's where it always is. honey, your dad's just a little late. that's all. just an hour. how about we give him a call? (telephone ringing) he's not late. he forgot. he wouldn't do that. maybe he's mad. Jake's always fooling around in the car. last time, he yanked off a radio knob. honey, he isn't mad at you, and he hasn't forgotten you. then where is he? frank, call for you on line two. I'd like to see Doug Anderson, please. you're Mrs. Anderson, aren't you? I used to be. yeah, uh, Doug is out on call right now. he's not here? no. he's out on a call with the truck. uh-huh. um, but I'd be glad to give him a message as soon as he gets back. would you please tell him his sons would like to know why he didn't come over when he said he would and why he didn't even call? and tell him if he can't be depended on, maybe I will have to try and figure out a way to make him keep his word. give him that message when he gets back with the truck. Virginia, would you bring your timecard up to the office, please? your outgoing telephone service has been disconnected. please contact the business office about reconnection. blackout! blackout! everyone else has lights. it's just us. lucky us. Mrs. Anderson. Mrs. Anderson. Mr. link. I've been trying to reach you. i'm afraid we're getting into a situation with your mortgage payments. oh, you mean how i'm a little late sometimes? Mrs. Anderson, you've been missing payments entirely. now, the bank likes to be flexible... and I appreciate that. but i'm afraid our charter mandates some limit to that flexibility. well, I guess we'll have to do something about that, won't we? yes. and we need to do it soon. where is he? where's who? Doug Anderson. don't tell me he's out with the truck because I am in no mood to hear that! Doug quit. what? yeah. a couple days ago, he quit. he said he was moving, so he quit. he's moving? moving where? I don't know. he told Mr. shoemaker he was leaving town, so he had to quit. leaving town? didn't you know? he already moved out of his apartment. i'm trying to get something out of the people who know Doug, but he told them not to talk to me. my savings are gone. the bank is about to start foreclosure on the house. you're county prosecutor. there's got to be something you can do. child support is a legal obligation. assistant. sorry? I am an assistant county prosecutor. o.k. we can serve papers to compel your husband to pay you, which we will be happy to do... thank you. the minute you locate him. the minute I locate him? can't serve papers on somebody when you don't know where they are. that's common sense. I get that. i'm still working on why I have to find him. we have very limited resources with which to do a lot of real work. this sort of thing just isn't a priority for your county prosecutor's office. we can't drop everything anytime a couple has a disagreement over a divorce settlement. you're not going to do anything? we will serve the appropriate papers. but I have to find him first. you find him, we'll serve him. I talked to Doug's parents in Wisconsin. thanks. what did they say? they said this has been upsetting for Doug. they don't think it'd be healthy for him to talk to me right now. you're not selling these, are you? that's a punch bowl, Mrs. lyons. I don't do a lot of entertaining these days. so how are the boys? oh, nothing fazes Jake. what about Matt? (Mrs. lyons) Gerri? how much for this? make me an offer. did I do something wrong? what was I supposed to do? stay married to him no matter what? that'd be crazy. I talked to my folks back in Wisconsin. they said I should just get out of here altogether-- just move, go back there. and move in with them? I guess so. do you think you'd do that? well, there's not much to keep me here, now that I've sold the punch bowl. thanks. maybe that's smart-- you know, going back and going home. I don't know. it doesn't feel smart. it feels like i'm running away. maybe there's a way to turn it into something smart-- figure out a way back into nursing school. yeah. Suzy, does Tom still talk to Doug? I don't know. well, they're best buddies. I can't figure Doug quitting and moving and not mentioning it to Tom. um, it hasn't really come up. well, do you think that there's a way you could make it come up? don't ask me that, Gerri. well, i'm pretty much at the end of my rope here, suz. look, if I ask Tom about Doug, he's going to know exactly why i'm asking, and right now, things between me and Tom are really o.k., and I got to do what I can to keep it like that. I know. i'm sorry. if we move, how's dad going to find us? well, we'll tell everybody that we're living with grandma and grandpa, and then when they see him, they can tell him. why is he mad at us? honey, he's not mad at you. he loves you guys. you know that. are we poor? no, we're not poor. we're broke, but we're not poor. come on, guys, move 'em out. let's go. I get the back seat! no, I get the back! (engine starts) give me it! hey, that's mine! all right, o.k., that's it. enough. one of you, up here right now! I don't care which one, but up here. put your seat belt on. stand back, guys. that's hot. watch out. the tailpipe is busted. are you o.k., mom? oh, yeah. i'm a regular bag of sunbeams. Jake? hey, Jake, where are your shoes? Jake, those are the only shoes you've got. now, where are they? Iowa. what? (Matt) I think he threw them out the window, mom. Jacob! (engine knocking) oh! oh, hello there! (man) hello! hi, mom. hi, dad. let's have a hug right now. how you doing, old man? ooh, yes. that's such a good hug. you know what? Jake doesn't have any shoes. honey, where are Jake's shoes? it's a long story. hi, dad. good to see you. you, too. hi, mom. hello, sweetie. oh. hey, you guys, let's go inside. Jake's not asleep. he's unconscious. mom, how come you didn't tell me about this? well, your father wouldn't hear of it. anyway, it's just a precaution-- something Dr. ryman thought we should have. mom, we can't stay here. of course you can. it's not fair to you and dad. it's all right. no, it's not all right. it's nowhere near being all right. honey, where will you go if you don't stay here? hmm? take this. o.k., we got some treats here. (woman) the pipes are o.k., except for that one in the bathroom. would you paint it? it was just painted two, three years ago. kids, right? yeah. two. kids are o.k., but no pets, except maybe, like, a goldfish, maybe a turtle-- like that. I understand. so? I'll take it. Nancy. Gerri. thanks, Bob. (door opens) mom! guys, hi. how you doing, mom? we're doing fine. how you guys doing? honey, I took these out of the paper for you. oh, thanks, mom. I'll just put these groceries away, and then I'll drive you home. how's dad? your father does not believe in complaining. Gerri, I love the boys. oh, they're nuts about you. honey... I don't think I can come over to watch them in the afternoons, not after this week. Dr. ryman feels this would be a good time for your dad's operation. it's minor, and they only keep you a day or two, but he's going to need someone there when he comes home. oh, no, I understand. oh...I feel like i'm leaving you in the lurch. it's o.k. listen, i'm going to go down to the state assistance office tomorrow. welfare? no, not welfare. probably a Grant or something like that to help me finish nursing school, but no, not welfare. but don't tell dad, o.k.? hey, guys. Matt. Matt. come on. rise and shine. come on. come on, Jake. let's go. you make too much money. how do you figure that? i'm part-time in a library, and half of what I make goes for baby-sitters. your gross pay is above the cutoff, and it says here you're receiving court-ordered child support. yeah, the court ordered it, but my ex-husband isn't paying it, so what am i supposed to do? you could quit your job. excuse me? if you quit your job, you'd be eligible for assistance, and we could help you. are you listening to yourself? i'm not going on welfare. I have a job. that's the problem. but even with the job, there is one program you're eligible for. cheese? federal surplus cheese. let me get this straight. the government won't help me unless I quit my job, but they will give me cheese. in 5-pound blocks, yes. hello, Clarice. Eddie? where's Doug? where's your son? Eddie, could you come here, please? I lost my house, Clarice. I lost my house because of him. he said he would pay child support, and he ran away. now, where is he? you. your son owes me money. our son owes you nothing. Eddie, come on. no. o.k., you know what? I'll tell you what. tell me when I've learned enough of a lesson, because I would like to buy my kids new sneakers. have a seat, Mrs. Anderson. will this take a long time? I was just going over the file. no, I mean to get the money from him. ahh. it'll take as long as it takes. well, it's just that i'm-- i'm not doing so well right now. I mean, i'm working two jobs, and i'm running double baby-sitter shifts. things are getting desperate. it could take a year to get your money, possibly longer... once you've located him. when am I supposed to locate him? on my 30-minute lunch break? when I swing by the apartment to see my kids between jobs? when exactly am I doing all this detective work, Mr. Quinn? once you've located him, action will be taken. nice kids. thank you. no pictures of their mother. we're divorced. o.k., guys. you almost done? yep. very good. o.k. you all set? grab your lunches. we got to go. hurry up. we got to hustle. there you go. (knock on door) (girl) sorry i'm late. (Gerri) all right, guys. i'm running, o.k.? be nice to Anne. I'll see you tonight. bye, mom. bye, mom. (Gerri) o.k., I'll be home by 10:00. if you need my mother, her phone number's on the refrigerator. half-hour of television, both in bed by 8:30, no sugar. it's too late for that. I was on my way home from work, and I thought I'd give you a call. o.k., I guess. been better. actually, um, Suzy, it's not good. what it is is, uh... is bad. well, they say I have to find Doug before they can do anything. Suzy, does Tom know where he is? please, Suzy, please tell me the truth. i'm calling you from a pay phone. I don't even have a phone anymore. no, you don't know what it's like! i--I have three jobs, I barely see my kids, i'm living off of federal cheese, and i'm making this call with change that I dug out of the back seat of my car, so you don't know what it's like. please, Suzy, will you just think about it? because i'm running out of ideas, and i'm running out of dimes. please? o.k. what are you doing? you are supposed to be asleep, not sneaking around! this cereal is for breakfast only. it has to last! do you know how much this junk costs? do you know how much I have to work to buy this? I am killing myself at three jobs trying to put food on the table, and this is what you do behind my back? leave him alone! he's eating it 'cause he's hungry. i'm hungry, too. we're hungry all the time, all right? and we know how much it costs because you're always telling us how much everything costs. that's why we're eating this cereal with no milk, o.k.? go back to bed. i'm sorry I yelled. (woman) do you have a job now? I used to, but not anymore. then you're eligible for assistance. good. hi, grandma! who's that? that was your dad when he was in high school. how come his hair looks so funny? everybody had funny-looking hair back then. (Clarice) Gerri. yeah? Eddie and I were going to go to the mall this afternoon. I got to look for a new drill. right. so, do you think the boys might want to come along? we could take them off your hands for a few hours. that would be nice. uh, ma'am, you can't buy toilet paper or toothpaste with food stamps. they're not a necessity. toilet paper? of course it's a necessity. to you and me, maybe, but not the good old government. I need a cleanup on aisle 7, please. cleanup on aisle 7. i'm sorry about that. here you go. Gerri? Sarah? yes! my god! oh, I thought you and Doug were in Kansas. um...we were, and now i'm here. oh. it's beautiful. the whole house, really. oh, my guys would love that swing. we used to have a swing in the big tree in our front yard. I think they miss it. I know I do. what happened? somebody else living in that house, somebody else's kids on that swing. no. I mean with you and Doug. I don't know. it's like I wanted to end the marriage, and he wanted it to never have happened. olly olly oxen free, and he's gone. he's gone, and i'm on welfare. the difference between where i used to be and where I am is just a couple of checks. it's just a couple of checks. do you think you might get married again? well, I don't see myself as much of a catch right now. I mean, it would be a solution, being married, wouldn't it? I guess so. so would winning the lottery. I don't think I should count on either one. it's not fair. no, it's not fair. well, I guess I'd better get my kids. thanks. haircuts, too? well, they needed them. they surely did. well, I guess I'd better get them home. thanks again. all right, guys. time to pack it up. hey, where you going? to change. change? yeah. put on the clothes we came here in. we explained to the boys, Gerri, that they can wear their new clothes when they're visiting and play with the new toys, but they can't take them with them when they go. why not? we don't owe you anything. the boys are different. what do you mean, different? well, if they need something, that's one thing. nobody's trying to punish them for what's happened. you just want to punish me, is that it? no. nobody's trying to punish anybody. we'll look out for the kids. somebody's got to. are you calling me a bad mother? i'm just saying Doug's kids deserve better. they sure as hell do, so why don't you call your wonderful son and ask him to pay his child support? you know, he provided for you for a good many years. he has a right to get on with his life. but it isn't just his life, is it? I didn't get to open all my stuff. when do we go back? shut up. mom? yes. you know the toys and things grandma gave us? they weren't so great anyways. really. stay in the car. (crying) that's it. that's where he lives. my friend back in Kansas finally worked up the nerve to send me his address. good. how about where he works? where he works? have you located his place of employment? you didn't tell me I needed his place of employment. you told me you needed to know where he lived. if we're going to garnishee his wages, we have to know where he works. why didn't you tell me that before? I assumed you knew. no, I didn't know, but i'm learning. is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Anderson? I don't think so. besides, i'm late for class. class? i'm studying to be an lpn. mmm. you are very resourceful. just average. I can't see nothing. move your finger, goof ball. take the picture. so, how are we doing? oh, we're doing fine. if a plane crashed here, my mom could save everybody because she's a licensed nurse. my biggest fan. yeah. I can tell. Mark wanted me to find out if you guys are thirsty. I'll have a beer. Gerri? sure. have you two officially met? uh, not yet, officially. Gary, this is Gerri, birthday girl and graduate. Gerri, this is Gary. nice to meet you. Gary is head of security at Mark's plant. well, one of the senior guards, anyway. I'll go get the beers. what? introduce me to a guy at my own birthday party so he starts off knowing how old I am. great move. did you think I was trying to set you up with Gary? I wasn't doing that. I would never do that. but since we're talking, what did you think of him? where's the relish? (Gary) what will you do with that license? (Gerri) I have a job. i'm going to work at the twin meadows nursing home. I know the place, sure. yeah. a friend of mine has a grandmother that lives there. it's a nice place. I start next week. it's going to be the closest thing to real money I've seen in a long time. how's that feel? feels good. yeah. Sarah sort of mentioned you, uh, had kind of a hard time lately. uh-huh. and did she sort of mention anything else? she said you had a sense of humor and a great personality. yikes! she didn't say that, did she? a great personality? mmm, I'll have to kill her as soon as the party's over. she also said you had two good-looking boys. which I do. and that they don't get to see their dad much. no, not much. oh, that can be tough. yeah. you know, the brewers have a farm team here in town. I thought maybe I could take them to a game or something. maybe we could all go. maybe we could. I didn't think I'd like being on a cruise ship, but this is rather nice now that i'm used to it. I miss the people on shore, but this is very nice, this boat. I mean this ship. what's the nicest thing about this ship, Rose? in the morning, when the sun comes out... how the deer come out of the woods, come down close to the windows, and stand there in the grass. they're very beautiful. Mr. Quinn! thanks, and tell Kelly Thursday's good. Mr. Quinn! I almost missed you. almost. I got this check from Doug. oh, good. see, I told you my letter would do the trick. we just had to be patient, that's all. but it's for $275.50. well, he's making an effort. that's important. well, what about the rest of the back child support? when a husband makes a gesture of good faith, we like to give a little room. by sending you a check, Mr. Anderson shows that he's not attempting to avoid payment. for $275.50? we're doing what we can, Mrs. Anderson, but you still haven't gotten us an employer. well, i'm still trying to. you're working now, right? yes. getting along? getting along. so you're surviving without the support payments. I was hoping for something a little bit better than just surviving, Mr. Quinn. this isn't really about the money, is it, Mrs. Anderson? well, if it isn't about the money, Mr. Quinn, then what is it about? revenge. whose revenge are we talking about, Mr. Quinn? you have a check. you should be grateful. five, please. pericarditis. it's an inflammation of the pericardial sac, the lining around the heart. 100% treatable. how long am i going to be here? better figure on being here about three weeks. and then? it'll be a while before you can go back to work. Dr. silverman to cardiology. Dr. silverman-- there. oh, that looks so nice. here you go, grandma. if you feel better in a little while, you should come out and see what the boys are doing with the tree. it's not a tree. it's a tumbleweed. oh, it's not bad. it sort of has a Charlie brown feel to it. well, this is a Charlie brown Christmas, that's for sure. what do you want Santa to bring you? you know what I would like for Christmas? I would like life to stop teaching me valuable lessons. everything that happens happens to teach us something. I got that... but I lost my job, and I wasn't there long enough to get medical insurance, and I haven't been out of work long enough to qualify for welfare again. I would really like a break. that's what I would like for Christmas. time off for good behavior. pass out the duck, Bob cratchit! there you are, sir. ha ha ha! Santa was a little tight this year, guys. that's o.k. that's from me and Matt. hey, a new crossword book. thanks! this will keep me busy. actually, it's not new. me and Jake erased all the answers so you could use it again. that's great. that's really very smart. listen, guys, i'm sorry. it wasn't supposed to be like this, nothing like this. but it's going to be different, because i'm going to make it different, o.k.? o.k. god bless us, every one. somebody tell that kid to shut up. (Gerri) hi. i'm sorry to bother you, but does Doug Anderson live in the apartment next-door? (woman) yes, he does. i'm driving through on my way to California. I visited his folks, and they gave me his address, but he doesn't seem to be home. well, he's probably at work. oh, gosh. well, I don't have a lot of time. you wouldn't know where he works, would you? go on. would you like to know what you got your sons for Christmas? I got nothing to say to you. Jake got a 75-cent bag of army men, and Matt got some socks. I told them they were from you, but I figure they know the truth. it's finished! no! you and me-- that is finished, but this is about the kids, Doug. do you remember the kids-- the ones walking around with your last name? I am trying to get on with my life, and that's what you should be doing instead of living in the past. I don't want to live in the past, Doug. I just want to pay it off. Doug! do you think i'm having a good time? do you think I enjoy doing this? yeah. maybe part of you does. Doug! Doug! Douglas! Doug, look at me! come on. look at me! the least you can do is look at me, Doug. look at me, Doug! look at me! (man) who is she? (man) I don't know. you seen her around here before? no. a-n-d-e-r-s-o-n? that's right. look, you sure you don't want to come back later? no. no. no. he needs this address. you're not in here. well, maybe you're looking in the wrong drawer. no. "out-of-state claims." it's the right drawer. where's my file? Mr. Quinn sort of has his own autonomous system here. I wouldn't want to disturb it. what's that? he has them coded. what do you know? "a-n-d-e-r-s-o-n." o.k... wait. this is a mistake. what is? well, they haven't been processed. processed? what do you mean, "processed"? he hasn't made an assessment. Mr. Quinn didn't sign them. he hasn't sent them along. sent them along where? your request never left this office. all the time I've been coming here nothing has left this office? nothing after his first request. no follow-ups. well, all those papers can't be mine. who else is in this box? (Quinn) what are you doing? get out. you haven't processed my claims. i'm still evaluating them. you haven't done anything. I come here. I bring you information. I ask you questions. you've done nothing. no paperwork leaves this office until I am personally satisfied that it meets all criteria-- my own as well as the state's. well, what is your criteria, Mr. Quinn? I would really like to know. what kind of flaming hoops do I have to jump through to get you to do your job? I wouldn't expect you to understand. try me. up and down these halls, there are offices filled with people whose job it is to take care of women-- to aid them, support them, find them places to live-- a great, flourishing bureaucracy dedicated to cushioning women from the realities of life. nowhere in this building will you find a place offering similar services to men because in the great feminist scheme of things, men don't seem to matter much. so if I take my time processing documents, if i'm just an extra bit careful about crossing ts and dotting is, maybe it's because I figure that's the only way I can give some poor son of a bitch a break. i'm doing my job, Mrs. Anderson. i'm doing it legally, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. you're wrong. there's a lot of offices in this building looking out for men. how come you're sitting there with your coat on? because I haven't taken it off yet. what's this? 35 cents. you don't have to pay it back right away. thanks. does that help? it's $8.64. six... seven... one, two, three, four. it will run sunday county-wide. thanks. you wouldn't have gone to this movie alone, would you? oh, I like movies. but this isn't the kind of movie a man picks for himself, right? maybe not. it's a funny kind of question. there's an awful lot I don't know about men. I have two sons that are going to be men some day. how's that going to work? they'll be fine. you think so? why wouldn't they be o.k.? I just keep thinking i'm screwing up or that i'm going to screw up. but you can drive yourself crazy with that kind of thinking. i'm pretty crazy now. you're o.k. you mean it? sure. oh, I don't know. Gerri, i'm not an especially deep dish, but the way I figure it, people are just people. we're all looking to make a couple of bucks and find someplace to live where there's someone to come home to. you're telling me I think too much. well, i'm telling you i'm sorry you've got so much to think about. well, then, you'd better buy me an ice-cream cone. o.k., I'll tell her when she gets in. thanks for calling. hi. are the boys in bed? I brought ice cream. look at this. what? all these women called you. why? your ad. it's in tomorrow's paper. which came out tonight. 10 calls. look at it. they want to know when the meeting is. meeting? what meeting? our meeting. I was just trying to see if Quinn gave anyone else the run-around. i'm trying to get him fired, that's all. I don't want to have a meeting. I could make coffee. I have a 20-cup maker. you don't think anyone else will call, do you? wow! yeah. wow. (Gerri) well, I'd like to thank you all for coming. I feel a little out of my league here. I mean, I wasn't even a brownie. I just thought if Quinn had pulled this stuff on other people, we could go over his head. and do what? get him out of there. get him fired. Quinn isn't the problem. he's my problem. even with the paperwork, you'd have to get family court to hear the case, and the sitting judge thinks the problem is women on welfare, not ones with jobs. well, who is he? her name is bodere. well, i'm not going back on welfare just to get her attention. what are we going to do? why does everyone keep asking me all the questions? because you put the ad in the paper. is this him? that's him. Mrs. Anderson. Mr. Quinn. what do you think you're doing? i'm trying to locate women who are having trouble collecting their child support. i'm putting a notice on the bulletin board. individuals can't put up personal messages. you have to be an organization before you can put things on this bulletin board. all right. now i'm an organization. (women) we want child support. we want child support. we want child support. we want child support. we want child support. a.c.e.s. stands for the association for children for enforcement of support. what we're hoping to do is get the family courts to really look at all the cases of working women-- all women-- that can't collect their child support and make it a priority, but the best thing you should do is ask judge bodere because here she comes right now. how do you respond to these allegations the women are making toward you? what's wrong with the system, judge bodere? judge bodere, why don't you support women? I cannot talk to you right this minute. (television) judge bodere said the change in policy in which family court would hear delinquent child support cases brought by women not on public assistance is not in response to any pressure but is a move she's been considering for more than a year. in other news, vice president bush met with congressional leaders... what's the matter? i'm just sorry we picketed her house, and she was all set to help us anyway. I should send her a thank-you note or something-- box of cookies maybe. sure. a box of cookies. ha ha ha! (telephone rings) (ring) hello. (man) who the hell do you think you are? you've got a lot of nerve asking-- it's a public space, isn't it? yes, but... family court is issuing writs, but it's up to the sheriff to serve them, which he isn't doing. well, now, resources are limited. oh, no. I understand. I understand completely. we all understand. that's why we're here, and we're going to be here until all of those orders, writs, summons, subpoenas, garnishments, and liens get some attention. let me see if I can get the sheriff for you. I'd appreciate that, deputy. (telephone rings) I'll get it. (Gerri) no! no! no, Matt! I'll get it. I'll get it. hello. (blows whistle) are you getting a lot of those? honey, take your cookies in the living room. enough. they all started right after the first TV story. they say they'll kill my children. they say they'll do awful things to me, and then they'll kill me. people I don't even know call me up and say things about me and my kids. "who do you think you are?" that's what they say. different words, same question. who do I think I am? (knock on door) who is it? it's kris. hey. are you o.k.? it's my ex-husband. what happened? he paid up. that's how I feel. six other women have gotten at least some of their back child support because of the orders. and Barry paying me makes seven. we should get you a shirt like the brave little tailor-- "killed seven with one blow." I think that was flies. and we owe it all to Gerri. she's Joan of arc and j. Edgar hoover all rolled into one. a toast to Gerri Anderson, our founding mother. she always gets her man. well, i'm going to get some change because we have to settle up soon. excuse me. can I get some singles? thank you. oh! girls' night out? excuse me? you and your friends over there-- girls' night out? um, sort of. hi. my name's Roy. oh, hello, Roy. someone pretty like you-- you should be able to find better company than a bunch of women. well, Roy, i'm flattered by the attention, but i'm kind of involved with someone right now, so you understand. getting ready to cut his off, too? who are you? just a guy. you may know about the law and getting on TV, but you don't know much about people, and you don't know anything about men. well, i'm learning something every day. well, it's a big joke, isn't it? some joke. I haven't seen my kids in three years. you understand me? three years. you take it all. you make a man feel like some kind of bug, and then you take his kids. now, where's the court says that's fair? where's the piece of paper says it's o.k. to do that to somebody? where? if I were you, I'd watch my step. the worm is going to turn. you watch if the worm doesn't turn. who was that? somebody's father. you want a gun? no, I don't want a gun. what kind of question is that? well, I was thinking-- with all the phone calls you've been getting, you know? I mean, I can't be around all the time. I'd teach you how to use it. no. thanks, just the same. how big a gun were you thinking? ah, you see? forget it. forget it. yeah. you say "forget it" because if you said yes, then you'd actually have to think about how maybe you're worried. well, you know, it's not like I planned this. i'm just making it up as I go along. from 7:00 in the morning till 3:30 in the afternoon, i'm at the hospital, and then the rest of the day i'm with the kids or on the phone or driving somewhere. what if they're right? who? the crazy people. the ones who keep calling me, telling me to mind my own business. you know, I was 15 when my folks broke up. one day, my dad was in the house. the next day, he was gone. I mean, you know, he paid support and everything, but what does a kid know from money? he wasn't...there. he went west-- Washington, Oregon. I'd get cards from him. my mom remarried, and the cards stopped. I mean, you know, not all at once, but they stopped. you know, I didn't get over it so much as I got used to it. lately, I started to think that maybe I should find out where he is, see how he's doing. maybe you should forget about what crazy people say. what happened? I got into a fight. what were you fighting about? nothing. you were fighting about nothing? that's pretty dumb. it was just a fight, o.k.? that's all. come on, Matt. it had to be about something. were they picking on you? it was about you, o.k.? what do you mean, it was about me? these guys--they said you were a witch, and that you stole money from hard-working men. do you think that's what i'm doing-- stealing money? I don't know. I don't think so. do you know what child support is? it's the money that dads have to pay when they leave, like when you lose a bet. it's money, and it's usually the dad who has to pay it, but not because he lost. it's not supposed to be a punishment. it's supposed to be for the children, so that they'll have what they need. that's all it's supposed to be. then how come it gets so messed up? is this an office or a closet? it's got a telephone. must be an office. yeah. here you go. hopefully, you'll track him down. ha ha! as his employer, you are responsible to garnishee his wages. uh--uh. listen. it is-- it is your re-- (sigh) o.k. well, you have a nice day, too. jerk. you know what, Anne? I think it would be best if you came into the a.c.e.s. office, and you filled out a form and some paperwork. ah, thank you. all right, now, the other ones go one on that desk, one on that desk... o.k., so here's an address of some people that I think might be able to help you. (telephone rings) (ring) hello. yeah, that's me. yes. I remember you. I hope you don't mind me calling you like this at home. I just felt-- well, I didn't want to call you at the office. I was wondering if I could meet you someplace and talk. o.k., that sounds good. bye-bye. thanks. all I know about my mother are her pictures. my dad brought me up. he was great, but it was hard. you know how hard it can get. yeah, I do. I took this job so that I could help people. you're supposed to give back what you can. that's what my dad taught me. that's what I thought I was doing-- helping Mr. Quinn to do. I didn't know. I swear I didn't know. Margaret, what didn't you know? look, i'm not saying this actually happened, but if somebody were to take a look at the box of files in his office, they might find it very interesting. they might even find that someone was cooking public records to cheat his own ex-wife out of support, and that's against the law. what are you saying? i'm not saying anything. i'm not saying anything at all. I don't know what to tell you, Donald. we're looking into things. we have to. it's not in-house anymore. a whole lot of people are watching. well, let them watch! we're looking. to tell you the truth, I don't like what i'm seeing. huh! I do my job. look, it's the way you do your job and some of the things it looks like you're doing with that job. I mean, I may be naive, but my understanding of government is it's supposed to help people, not punish them. so. so I don't see the city council standing up to take a bullet for you on this. it's not important enough. you're not important enough. what are you telling me? you might want to think about a career change-- something in the private sector. the sooner, the better. (telephone rings) huh! (door opens) (door closes) (ring) that's it. pack it up, George. (indistinct radio transmitting) there you go. (approaching siren) what is it? what do you think? not again? yeah. Phyllis took the call. "you moneysuckers have 10 minutes to clear out before we blow up the building." the bomb squad is going through the office now. and how was your day? Gerri! constance! where have you been? I've been calling the office for half an hour! what happened? did you tell them? tell them what? you don't know? what? what don't I know? Quinn is gone. he's gone? he quit. you're kidding! he quit before they could fire him is my guess, and there's still going to be an investigation. o.k.! the building has been checked! you can go back inside now! it's all clear! wrap it up, guys. take those barricades down. hi! we just got back from the store. the guys are in their room. what are you doing home so early? Quinn. he quit. really? really. that's great! I guess so. you guess so? it's what you wanted. yeah. what? I thought I would feel different if it happened. I thought I would feel something... but I don't. it just doesn't make any sense. sure, it does. it's not just about getting Quinn fired anymore. it hasn't been about that for a long time. well, what is it about? you're in the middle, so I guess you can't see it, but you're shaking things up. well, who am i to shake things up? where do I get off telling people to change laws and to fire people? why am I the one that has to get the bomb threats and the filthy phone calls? because you're the one who put the ad in the paper. (sigh) sometimes i'm so jealous of you. Sarah, you have a husband and a house and beautiful things. I live in a thrift store. what could you possibly be jealous of? you're changing the world. no, i'm not. don't say that. o.k., o.k. because of you, something in the world is changing. people will be different, their lives will be different, because of what you're doing. I was just trying to make sure everything would be all right for my kids, and the next thing I know, I turn around, and there's this big parade behind me. (knock on door) hi. I've got a certified letter for Geraldine Anderson. that's me. (mailman) great. there you go. sign on line 10, please. thanks. thank you. scarborough, shinbraut, and spano, attorneys-at-law. what is it? it's from Doug's lawyer. (gasp) it's a check for all the back child support. it's a check for $7,856. there you go. think those will make you fast? yeah! let's see. (knock on door) go ahead. open it. dad! hey! ha ha ha! how are you? hi. hi. you look good. thanks. we were waiting for you. well, i'm here now, so get ready. ha ha! (Gerri) go on, guys. go get your coats. and take your time. (door closes) you're growing a beard again. oh, yeah. I always liked that look on you. ha ha! the kids are looking o.k. yeah. they're tough-- tougher than you'd think. good. I wish they didn't have to be so tough sometimes. what am I supposed to say to that? is there something... you want me to say to that? no. you want me to say i'm sorry? not to me. maybe to the boys later, if you get a chance. well, you're famous. ha ha! ha ha! no, i'm not. sure, you are. I keep seeing you on TV and in the papers. you're in the state capitol, talking to senators, reporters. my ex-wife's a celebrity. ha ha! yeah. biggest bitch in town. people say stupid things all the time. you shouldn't listen to them. no, probably not. so, you're o.k.? seeing somebody? ha ha! you don't have to be interested in me, Doug. it's o.k. but you do have to stay interested in the boys. you can't just walk in here today and figure that's it. you have to show up. you can't walk away from them again. I understand. they're my sons, too, and I missed them. I missed them. we probably shouldn't have been married, you and me. we were doing all right there for a while. ha ha! ha ha! yeah. do you ever think about it? how that went away-- got lost? I used to-- not so much lately. me, neither. i'm thinking it doesn't much matter. it doesn't make a difference how crummy we were as a couple. the important thing is-- the thing that counts is we made children, and when you make children, you make promises. (footsteps) hey, you ready to go? yep. come on, Jake! so, you still like French fries? yep. well, let's get some. come here, you! oh, golly! you are so big. come on. let's move. o.k.? all right. have fun. Doug? hmm? yeah, I am seeing somebody. good. me, too. good. nonsupport affects over 23 million children in this country. nearly 9 out of 10 children on welfare are entitled to child support and don't get it. $24 billion in accumulated support is owed to these kids. listen, this is a rented dress, and... this is starting to feel like a rented speech. (laughter) don't get me wrong. the problem is real. I've seen normal people, both men and women... using their kids as clubs to beat each other over the head. kids ask so many questions. it's how they learn, how they make their brains grow right in front of you. well, at the end of the day, when we're all finished... someone is going to ask us questions. "what did you do for the children?" "did you treat them right?" "did you do for them?" and we better have some really good answers. thank you. (applause) yes! "in recognition "of her tireless efforts "as an advocate of children and their rights." yeah, and we got shrimp cocktail out of the deal, too. I guess you helped a lot of people. I guess I did. that makes you a hero. does it? yep, even without the plaque. god, you are so handsome. you're going to be such a man someday. Jake? honey? where are your shoes?
