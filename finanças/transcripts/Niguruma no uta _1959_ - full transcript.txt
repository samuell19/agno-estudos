This film was created by the hands of 3,200,000 farm women. When all human beings acknowledge each other as human, let the precious joy that results be universal. When this joy lives forever in the hearts of women, and is handed down to daughters who become mothers... then tomorrow will not just repeat today, but be a new beginning. With these thoughts in our hearts, we made this film. Executive Producer: National Farm Village Film Assoc.

He's a very dutiful son and all. He doesn't waste any money. He gives his salary packet straight to his mother still unopened. He's a good son for sure! - For sure! Postal delivery. Postal delivery. In his indigo jacket and postal hat... Moichi cut a fine figure. People said he looked dashing. He was a fast runner and could read and write. Moichi's good reputation was widely acknowledged. At that time I worked... as a maid servant for Mr. Nanshiki... a wealthy landowner with a large estate. When Moichi delivered a letter... he always asked for water from the back garden well. Almost as if prearranged... around the time Moichi was expected... I would go to the back to do the washing. What's that? Wild grapes. They're sweet. Ahhh... tastes good. Since this is my last drink here, even tastier. Why? I'm quitting... this job. Such a good job? Everyone envies you. Why? Since Japan won the China war... prices have kept going up. At 6 'sen' for a 'shou' of rice, I make too little. (100 sen = 1 yen ... 1 Shou = 1.8 litres) At these prices... I just can't manage. I'll buy a house. I'm gonna make my fortune. I'll earn lots. I saved 8 yen and bought a hand-cart. I saved from my meagre salary. Eight yen... so much? - Ya. I'll earn, you'll see. I'll build a big warehouse and own many carts. Are you... interested in marrying me? So...? It's only... you can read and write. I'm not good enough. If you're willing... forget all that. Please... just say yes. But... I have to ask my parents. Send them a message urgently. Please do it! Hey... postal delivery... So I travelled the 20 kms... back to my family home. Father... tea's ready, come. If we let you marry someone with nothing... what will happen? If you do this against my will... you're disowned! From now on you're not family, ever! If this had been arranged by your employer... it would be different. If your parents have disowned you... then I wash my hands of you too. You're fired. You'll have to manage on your own. Pardon... but where is Mr. Moichi's house? Just over there. Thank you very much. Are you Moichi's mother? Who wants to know? Seki's my name. Moichi must have told you about me. Mother... where's Moichi? Not here. How was it? They disowned me. The landlord too. Is it okay? I see... you're not happy with it. Na, na. Come along. Hey... She turns up with only a small bundle. You want her here without a ceremony? I can't accept such a person as a daughter-in-law. We too are very... - Yes, we are poor. Even a young girl looks down on us. I was thinking... you'd have less work with her. Anyway, now she's here... having come all the way. I'm not worthy... I'll do my very best for you. If you can't handle it what then? Now you see us like beggars making charcoal for a living. Our ancestors came from the fallen Heike. One of our people made the customs gate for the territory. In return we were granted a family title. But his father wasted all our money. That's why he made such a house. I was widowed when I was 24. I've managed depending on this one and making charcoal. I won't give my son to a good-for-nothing girl. What will I do, Moichi? Tell me, Moichi. Do your best for my mother and don't worry about me. If mother's not happy you can't stay. Can't do it? I rejected my own parents for you, Moichi. Sit down. Come sit down. About all this... please be patient for my sake. There's no place for her here. What will Seki do? She can work. She's an Akana woman. Let her pull a cart with the men over the summit and back If she can't do that you won't make your fortune. Please let me pull a cart. Without a cart... how can you? Borrow and buy one somehow. I'll pay it back from my earnings. MITSUGU TOWN You got a nice woman eh? Lucky guy... - Isn't he! Hey Utaro... get back to work. Eh, she's a good one. - No, not like that. There... this one. Looks strong... - It is. You should thank him. Thank you. - We'll have to work hard to pay him. Ah... pay it over time. Thanks for your kindness. From now on it's our cart. Keep it in balance. - She's a good one. Got it? Sanzo... earn well like Moichi. Don't live off your brother forever. Hatsu brother... we'll stop to eat here. Don't worry, go on ahead. Okay. Thank you for the work. Not at all. Hatsuzo brother is a decent guy you know. When his family split up he received nothing for himself. Hatsuzo started by bying one cart. And left working the rice field to the women. He's not worried now. Even supporting his brother's no problem. We need to do the same quickly. Why so tired... just pulling an empty cart. When it's loaded it'll be much harder. However hard it is, if I'm with you I can go on all day. If you dream to be an owner... even millet tastes good. - ya. Do you have rice in your lunch? Plain rice is good enough. Give me a little. Mom says I should return what I don't eat. Tazuno, come here. - Yes. Give me the file. What happened? It's in poor condition. - What a pain. Why're you moving so slow. Hurry and bring sake. Sake's finished, finished, no more! Bring it! Bring it! What happened? Father's losing it! He's angry at everyone and getting violent. Hurry, bring sake. Sake, sake! - I'll buy some. Natsuno's got lots'a trouble, eh. Tosaro is a good man but his father drinks sake like water. He gets furious and then violent. He's bad tempered and won't work. He's had many wives but they all left him. You just getting back? - Ah. Who's that pulling the other cart? Oh... only a few days ago... I married her. Oh my! Never even replied to my proposal. You're terrible! I'll also get a husband... okay? Who's she to you? She said I should marry her. But she's not a worker, what to do? Coming through. - Working hard are you? Let me do it. - Who's that? Hachizo's younger brother brought her back. Hey move! She's a failed actress... no one knows from where. Hey... bring the rope in. - Right. Medicinal baths are good against chills. She took them for a whole year. Such a sickly woman... better not to marry her. Moichi... Your bath is ready for you, come. - Thank you. You too, Seki. NISHI BATHHOUSE The Russo-Japanese war broke out. Japan achieved a great victory. The war brought hardship, and we had to work very hard. Our Otoyo was born. A girl child won't bring a good future, is what Moichi said. My mother-in-law, in her foul mood, never cared for the child. By then Otoyo was almost 18 months. What are you doing? Hurry up. - Yes. Dry and warm, okay. There, there... all done. Be a good girl and wait for me. There. Mother... I made the baby's food. Please take care. (Sings about a peasant's life.) We're on the road at midnight... reaching Funo village by daylight. There we load up, reaching Miyoshi village... after 11 that morning. There and back, everyday a total of 40 kms. You're late eh? - Oh ya. Hey, let's have a quick drink. Noisy aren't you! If I pick you up everytime, no work'll get done. Cry, cry. Cry all you like. What happened. My breasts are swollen. I had to squeeze some out. Hey look at that. Good baby, good baby. I'll give you lots of mummy's milk. - Oh! Oh! Come, come. Some parents bring their babies. My Otoyo won't even get her diaper changed. She's probably crying and miserable. When we first started this job... we could pull 3 times more rice, no trouble. It's the old story. These days we're both working but only pull half what we used to. If this goes on we'll never get our own place. We have to find a way. You say find a way, but we can't do any more than this. All the others work two days and rest one. Or maybe pull for three days and rest one. We pull for 5 days straight. - We can't pull in heavy rain or wind. When the snow starts falling we can't pull for 2 months. If we don't work 5 out of 6 days... every month we lose three whole trips. We also need two pairs of sandals per trip. Maybe you should make the sandals yourself. Ah!... What's happening here? Maybe a big rain's coming. - Rain? Just joking. - Hey, Moichi... It's rare we see you here. I've got a bit of a cold. - That's not good. Welcome. Hey... a sake for me... with roasted fish. You want soup? Hey... one tofu soup. How old's your baby? One year and three months. Dear... this baby's around Otoyo's age. Is she walking yet? Yes... past one or two houses. Mine hasn't started walking yet. Oh my... you must be worried. It's delicious. We women... nothing makes us happier than to put a clean, dry nappy on our baby. We have... no one at home to watch him. It's a pity... all day long he rides in the cart. But you can care for him yourself, that's good right. Dear... from tomorrow... let's bring Otoyo on our cart like them. Mother will be offended. She'll gossip that you say she doesn't care for the baby. Let me have a bite of your tofu. Have it all. It's more important to me... that Otoyo's bum is dry than to eat tofu soup. Okay then... Sister... bring another hot soup. - Coming. Here you go... yum, yum. Good eh. Here's your order. From Miyoshi to Funo town... we return carrying mixed goods. From Funo the road climbs. It's very tiring. Even so, it's better for us than pulling empty carts. What's up with you? Aren't you in the least worried that Otoyo's not walking yet? It's just her fate. If it's her destiny, she'll live. It's just the life she's been given. That's all you have to say about such a thing? A girl child brings me no joy. Can I take Otoyo to 'Saikoku' for a pilgrimage? (Old name for Shikoku.) Pilgrims seem nice but they're just beggars. Stop your nonsense. Get moving! Even if I become a miserable beggar... I want to give Otoyo the breast milk she needs. And keep her in dry clothes. In those days, if a woman wanted to go on a pilgrimage... the mother-in-law was sure to allow it. If not, she'd be called an evil spirit. ICHIGO STORE Thank you. She's so sweet. Is this you're first time? - Yes. Boiled sweet potato. Thank you very much. So what are you praying for? My baby's weak. That's why we're going on pilgrimage around Shikoku. So you're going to Shikoku. When you cross the water to Shikoku... the island has 88 sacred temples spread all along... the 1,200 kms of it's coastline. This is what the kind beggar told me. So I travelled there... I would do whatever it took for my child to grow strong. This is all I prayed for. For many, many days I continued along the pilgrimage route. I ended by walking to all 88 temples safely. On my return journey, I passed many villages along the warm coast. Something happened when I visited the Kanon temple at Abuto. (Godess of safe voyages and healthy babies.) Thanks to kind people, I always had rice. I ate rice cakes and had enough breast milk. Everyday I could feed her lots of my milk. That's good, isn't it. She's such a sweet child. How old is she? She's three years old - Three? Ohh... she's too small for a three year old. Did she have a problem? Yes. I only hope she will walk soon. Look then! She's walking. Auntie... Otoyo's walking! Good, good. It's because of your faith. Walk... walk. Walk, walk strongly. Keep walking, keep walking. Good girl. Good girl. Wait, wait for me. Wait, wait The Meiji emporer died. The new Taisho era began. Otoyo was in elementary school when Tomeko was born. Otoyo's a stupid girl. What? Otoyo dumb dumb, na na! You idiots. - What, wanna fight? Otoyo, don't give up. Don't give up. Get him! Let's go. Bleating like a goat... naaa, naaa. (Mocking the sound of his crying.) Good-bye. - Bye bye. I'm home. Blooming, blooming... What flower's blooming? Blooming... Blooming, a lotus flower's opened up. Blooming... Hey girl! That persimmon... Don't pick it! Fooling around, when you should clean the lamp glass? This girl's a useless shit-bag! Always eats like a pig! I may be just a girl, but granny's one too. What...?! A girl who calls another girl... a useless shit-bag. The godess will punish you. You shit-bag... Send you to school and you only learn to sass. I won't make your lunch-box. Hit me... hit if you can! You... Granny's getting senile! Like Ushiwakamaru, jump and escape! (Fabled 12th century Kamakura warrior.) Come, come, come... he clapped his hands...Yay! You... shit bag! Fell down... on her ass... Yah, yah! Hurry, come on! I feel sick. What's the matter? I... think a baby's coming. What another baby!? Last one hasn't any teeth yet. Should I lose it? Could be a boy. That'd be good. I also want to bear a son. Please let me have it. I'll have it. Ships raise your sails Shura shu, shu, shu. (wind in the sails) Take the pilgrimage around Shikoku. See Sanshuu Nakanogiri atop Mount Zozu. I'm back. See Kompira Daigongen shrine. You must visit here, at least once. What happened? Papa tied me up. Why'd he tie you up? - Don't know. What'd Otoyo do that's so bad? She fought with Granny. It's not good. Today we bought 'konnyaku'. (jellied vegetables) I want some with vinegar-miso. Bring some. Am I allowed to take it out? No need to ask Granny everything. I said take out, take out. Taking without asking me?! I told her to take it out. Whatever happens now... you two decide, do what you like. Seki, from now on you sit here. I want konnyaku with vinegar-miso. Can you get some, Mom? Please ask Madame Seki to get it. You show me no respect... so your child desrespects me. Go ahead. Ridicule me all you like. O ships, ships to Kompira Raise the sails "Shura-shu-shu-shu". I spotted it, the first star! Mom! Otoyo... - Mom! Tomeko... Otoyo, you've become such a caring daughter. I came this far... but only today. From tomorrow, I'll meet you at the Jizo shrine. If Granny finds out there'll be trouble. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sweating. - Yah, yah. Pulling a cart makes you sweat a lot. It's back breaking work, no? - Yah. Pulling a cart is back breaking... makes you hungry too. You really understand Mommy's hard work. Right, Tomeko? What...? - Just come on. Put you hand in the hole in this pine tree. What's in there? - Just put it in! How'd you get it? This is where I keep my lunch. Granny doesn't give you rice for lunch. But, even though she hates me... just to show off at school, she gives me a rice bowl. Hurry and eat! I'll keep it here every day from now on. Eat it up! Thank you. Num, num... num, num. Otoyo, I'm happy you're such a caring daughter. But your kind intentions are enough for me. From tomorrow there's no need. It's fine, it's fine. It's not fine. You're growing and need to eat well. You mustn't go hungry at all. Have you really understood? Still thanks. Thank you. I said it's fine! Every day stop here to eat and enjoy. When the snow stood deep... cart pulling became impossible. Moichi carried loads from 12 kms. away. We wove straw charcoal containers. I'm back. Was it cold? - Not bad. Granny, are you hungry? Shall I grill you some rice cakes? You say it to please me. You'll ask money for it later. Take some out and grill them then. Mother...? Shall I do some knitting after finishing this? You don't have to ask me. If you want to knit, go ahead. Shouldn't I get ready before the next baby comes. You better have a boy this time, no? I'm determined to. You can knit, but you're no big house madam. Don't think you can knit all day. You're husband is out carrying loads in the snow. When I was carrying Moichi, they never let me knit in the daytime. They refused. So I hid it under the covers at night. My mother-in-law was too strict. I cried a lot. Granny, it's ready. Otoyo! What did you just do? I didn't do anything. - You're lying. You're trying to hide something. Why are you always hiding things from me? I didn't do it. Didn't do anything, shitty old hag! Let go! - Hateful child! Always hiding things. You stole a rice cake. Mother... - Let me go! Mother, please calm down. - She thinks she can fool me. Tie me. Tie me up! I'll tie you up until you apologize. - Never! Just apologize. - No way! Never... shit granny! Let me go! Die! Die! Hurry up and die! Seki... She must've passed out. Dear... Otoyo's gone! She's gone? I should go. Otoyo! Find her? - Not yet. What to do? Scare her. Say you'll sell her to 'Daruma-ya'. (tea house/brothel) Where can she have gone? - The poor girl. Even after prayers we still have no child. Found her. - We found Otoyo. - Ken, you found her? Where is she? - Sound asleep in the Jizo shrine. We tried, but couldn't wake her up. No? - Ya. Don't go. Until that shitty kid almost dies, she'll never be human. Leave her there. It's 'cause her parents spoil her. Komura-san... Let's go and talk to her. Otoyo... you must be freezing. Auntie...! So... come on. Put your shoes on. Sell you to 'Daruma-ya'... auntie won't let them. If they say that... you can stay with Auntie. I'll teach you shamisen, no? Seki-san... Otoyo's coming back. Mommy! - Otoyo! Last night she slept in a warm bed with us. So don't worry. I won't allow her in this house. Grandma... have a heart. - No. Moichi... either send this thing away... or I leave this house. Apologize Otoyo, apologize. I won't. Well, well... for now she can stay with me. Alright Seki-san, Moichi-san...? Come let's go. I'm sorry. Sanzo's wife wants to bring up Otoyo. Just imagine that she was kidnapped. Let your brother and his wife care for her. Brother... I too have a parent. Even if she's a shitty-Grandma, mother is mother. I can't just answer you without her okay. As for tonight... - I understand. The girl is fighting with your mother. Supporting your mother, you two tied up and beat that little girl. You only think to please your mother. What will you do if today's trouble happens again... eh? So let us plug our ears... while you two discuss this. What? - What do you think? Only I'm not sure... if brother can handle the girl. I worry I'll never see Otoyo again. - What? I think we should ask Otoyo what she wants. Then go and ask her. - Right. It's a good idea, no? Moichi... it's cold, take your cup and drink some sake. Good evening. - Oseki sister...? Come in. Can I talk to Otoyo a little? Already asleep. Lecturing her's as effective as a fart in the wind. After thinking about everything she said, she'd rather live here. Dear, what are you saying? We should be begging her with our heads bowed low. So sister, come in and say whatever you want to her. Otoyo, Otoyo... Mommy! Well Otoyo... they're asking that you become their daughter. What do you think? It's better they adopt me. For you too... less worry for you. Besides one less to feed, isn't it? If you become their child who knows where they might take you. And it's possible you might never come back. Even so... I'd be adopted. Don't cry, don't cry. Your crying when I'm not. People will laugh. But if... I go away somewhere... no one will be there to put rice in the pine tree for you? Mommy! You'll miss the fun. You don't need to worry about that. Matsumo-san from Miyanomaru will take care of it. Really? You happy? Listen Seki-san... we plan to open a shop... when spring comes... she can come with us to Hiroshima... if you agree. If so, it's not too far to visit her or bring her back. So you don't have to worry. Moichi-san... she's talking so sweetly, no? I've treated her very badly, but she doesn't hate me. She's accepted so gracefully. Endure your troubles, Otoyo. ENSHUYA INN We are eating in such a fine inn... because of Otoyo our caring daughter. Right... Seki? What are you saying? Oseki sister... please pick-up your chop sticks. Say, Brother... There's only one thing I want to say. I remember one drama scenario. A husband, concerned for his wife, worked hard to earn money. I hope you... will take good care of sister. That's right. Take good care of Mom, right? Please excuse me. ENSHUYA two years or three years old... four or five years old... children are... Sister if you want brother to take good care of you... once a day check the mirror to ensure you're looking good. Yes, yes... I meant to give you my hand mirror as a momento. Even suffering pulling a cart to stay with her husband... 'til now her husband hasn't once bought her hair oil. It's so pathetic, no? From now on put oil in your hair and check the mirror everyday. Thank you very much. Mommy, you got something nice. Thank you, thank you so much. Be a good girl. Be a help to Auntie. Komura-san... look after her. Take good care of her. Thank you very much. - Good bye. Goodbye. - Goodbye... goodbye. Goodbye. Seki, come on! Don't cry. It's over. Have you lost interest in me now? What on earth are you saying? Am I that useless now? What's all this? Other's see it that way. Pullling a cart 20 kims and back every day... my hair gets wind blown... my face gets wind burnt... my shoulders are like a man's. My legs are like a grasshopper's. No wonder you're no longer interested. Me too... like Komura sister said... I'd like you to wear make up and eat good food. What more can I do? - It's okay, it's okay. Don't waste money polishing up this body. From the beginning I never expected to use make up everyday. Maybe I could use sometihing to protect my skin. Skin cream is popular for women these days. Should I buy some? Isn't it expensive? What were you thinking? You're a king or something? Cart pullers... does even one of them apply beauty cream? But it's not expensive. Only two sen. Not even once... did anyone buy... that sort of soft thing for me. I loved Moichi so much... a widow at twenty... a widow at thrity... as a widow I could never look nice or be happy in public. It was supposed to be plain. I only used lamp oil. I tortured my youth, going 10 days without once touching a comb. I sleep beside you two young ones. I want to get old fast. Because I want to get old fast... I'm forcing myself to get old. You never even look at me. You bought beauty cream for your wife. You don't need me anymore! You're already... seven months now. I feel guilty asking you to help me. At least... mother doesn't make me pull the cart now. I have a feeling this one might be the son Moichi wants. I have to be careful not to lose it. If it's a boy won't your mother want it? She wants a boy... but it upsets her I'm not working. Though... I'm glad I'm able to help with your field work. Seki... come in please. Have some cold wheat tea. - Thank you very much. Don't be shy, no. Hey there. Take a break in my house. Only place you can, no? What's it about... this writing? Ah, local people, rise up! There's no end to it. The price of rice keeps going up. All because of... corrupt businessmen. We must get fighting mad. Rise up local folk. I can't really understand. Roughly what does it mean? Ah, roughly... eh. Poor people have to do something... because the rice price is sky high. Corrupt businessmen... are hoarding and hiding rice. Poor people only feel angry. Being angry, isn't enough. They say... we need a leader. Something like that. It's exactly right. We are getting very angry. The corrupt merchants in our village... ought to be punished. When it happened in Yamanashi they refused to rent land to the farmers. What's that? What? It's happening here in Miyoshi town. It's a bad time for our wage negotiations. "Save the Farm Folk" "Rice Price Must Go Down" Rice... Seki-san... trouble! What's happened? There were riots in Miyoshi town. Moichi was arrested by the police. - What? Why'd they take my husband? The Miyoshi cart-pullers... were there for wage negotiations. They all got arrested. What to do? Seki-san... are you alright? Seki-san...? Hae-san... go call Natsuno. - Okay. Seki-san... It's a boy. Is that so. He's a little early. But he's fine, fine. It doesn't matter if he's early. So long as both are fine. Now we have a family heir too. That's good isn't it granny? Moichi will be very happy too. Natsuno-san... please serve everyone generously for us. Seki-san... It's good, no? You did well. You don't need to worry about Moichi. We'll all go together and bring him back. Just relax. Put your mind at ease. Ten years later... Torao grew into a healthy boy. Our work pulling carts went on well. Renting '4 tan' of paddy land, we started field work too. (almost 1/4 acre or 1,000 m²) Meanwhile Sueko and Saburo were born and grew up. With the help of the village assist fund we built a house. With the help of many people... we could finally realize our dream of a cart-pullers warehouse. There it is, Mother... It's great. It's big. Thanks a lot. Here Mom. You can sleep with plenty of room. Hurry up with the bed. You must be tired. Oh it's so beautiful. Koyuki-san... good house, no? - It sure is. Granny, isn't the smell of fresh tatami matts great? Even a corner in a stable's enough for me. I'll die soon anyway. Don't talk nonsense. You're the head of the house, so get well soon. Even if you say fine things I don't feel any better. I'm so thirsty and I've got heartburn. Just here... it's like a nail. Must be someone who hates me... using black magic to drive it in. Who would drive a nail in you. It just your fever. Please soothe me. Moichi. - Ya? Please soothe me. - Here? Hurry, bring a cool cloth. Keep quiet. Go play outside. - Yay. Seki-san... The old woman... how's she doing? When the doctor saw her... he said she has liver desease. She keeps saying the children's noise drives her blood pressure up. Shall I keep them at my place? Our Toki likes children. That's very kind of you. Surely your old man would complain. - Nope. These days I'm his "Natsuno, Natsuno", so I can do as I like. Ah really? Only last night... Granny wanted to eat sweet arrowroot pudding. So I put prepared it with honey... and she said, "You take a sip first." As if I might've poisined it. She makes me feel so miserable... I want to rip her heart out. Natsuno-san... have I become a demon? What makes you say such a thing? - Even though... I see Granny suffering and very sick... I feel like it's what she deserves. The sicker she gets, the more I feel that way. In your case... it's just bugs in your mind. Bugs? They're inner bugs. I have them too. They were so strong even I was surprised. Because of those bugs, I got the energy to make my gloomy house bright. I prepared a medicinal bath for my mother-in-law every day without fail. Don't try to escape from your mother-in-law. Jump inside her heart. Jump in...? Don't just look at her sideways. You have to do something. Try to understand what's in Granny's heart. Then you can control her heart... and change things completely. Natsuno-san... Thank-you. I didn't know how to deal with her. For the old woman... all she's known from childhood is hardship. I suspect she's afraid to die without knowing human affection. I'll make a complete change. Natsuno-san... From tomorrow I'll concentrate only on Granny's wellbeing. Please look after my kids. Okay then. Please do. After that... I cared soley for Granny. I thought the most important thing for her... was to bring her fever down. Removing the seeds I placed pickeled plums on her forehead. I also applied a paste of daffodil bulbs to the soles of her feet. I gave her medicinal tea. To protect against bedsores I sent Moichi to buy some air pillows. Seki! - Here. The medical shop only had one air pillow. Let me do it. Give it me! Oh! It's filling up. Mother... How's that, Mother? - Ah, much better. Now it doesn't hurt. - Good, good. Mother... big sister Otoyo's coming. Oto! Haven't you grown big! - Yes. It's been such a long time. Look here... can you believe she's the same Otoyo always tied to the tree. I'm back. You're so grown up. Welcome back from so far away. Father... Everyone come inside. Come in, come in. Such a fine place you built. You made a lot of money? What d'you mean? How could we make so much. We built it with help from the village fund. You must have taken a loan then. I guessed you must have. It's only a warehouse. But we own three carts. Father, come sit. - Who me? - Yes. I'm afraid... I have a meeting at Hatsuzo's place. I have to go. Natsuno-san, move in and be comfortable. - Come back soon. So then, how did Komura-san let Otoyo go so far away? After bringing her up so well. They say adopting a child helps you have your own. After adopting me they had a little boy, didn't they. That's why they let her come back. Old granny? - She's resting. She fell asleep just now, so don't disturb her. It must be tough on you. Oh ya, Tomeko... For you. - Please take. Mother... Thank you. - So nice. Sister, you have lots of clothes. Are they all from Komura-san? - Yes. After their son's birth I worried they might forget me. So I kept asking for new clothes. Just like Otoyo-san, no? Oh Seki-san. - Yes. Have you woken up? I'm terribly sweaty. - Right, right. Thanks so much. Mother... sorry for the wait. There... that is just right. That's better then. Open your eyes wide and look. Grandma... Who's she? Who do you think? It's me, no? It's me Otoyo. Otoyo... I'm sorry you're not well. But you'll feel better, now I've come back. I'll spend my time caring for you. Instead of hating me... the words you say are so kind. I can die at ease now. What are you saying? Granny... Granny this your favourite sweet. I hear that... you've been patient and haven't complained at all. You're really amazing, no. - Who told you such a thing. Mother. Seki-san said that? What Otoyo... - It's okay. Seki-san... I'm sorry. For a long time I thought you were cold. I couldn't see in your heart. I'm sorry I doubted you so much. Please forgive me. If you talk like this, I... For a long time, I couldn't see things from your side. I... - No it's not, it's not so. Enough... enough. I'm happy. Mom and Granny getting along nicely, what else can I say? So... then please hold hands for me. Hold hands. Otoyo has come back. We built such a fine house. I'm ready now... to be taken away at anytime. I feel so good. Listen all... in the nearby mountains... the sweet bulbul is singing. It doesn't wake us up... It's the first time she's been in such a good mood. Did Otoyo really came back? for the morning grass cutting. Hey... but in Sasane it wakes... the king of Sasane from his slumber." Well then... not to speak ill of the dead... but now the griping granny's gone, Seki will be able to relax a little. You have such nice daughters too... isn't it so? You just need a lover now. Please don't joke like that. I'm not like Oryo-san. Oryo-san... Be a little restrained. Mother has just died. Oh! You're scarry. Moichi's getting angry... almost as if I was his wife. I know why... Moichi-san. Because I got married a second time... he's jealous. You idiot. - Moichi-san... You'd marry any useless fellow. Leave me alone. It's my business who I marry. Right Natsuno-san? Seki... the people helping out will take a break. Take them some tea. Where're you guys going? To the village in the pass. One of our carts takes four hand-cart loads. Horse carts are the thing. Soon we'll take everything. Moichi... Don't worry. Horse carts are horse carts, hand carts are hand carts. I'm not wild grass. I'll never be eaten by a horse. So there's no need to worry? If we help each other everything will be fine. You signed as guarantor for three people. Will happiness ever come for us? So our warehouse dream is finished now? Not only the warehouse dream. We may even have to sell this house. Seki... one more sake. (In the background they're playing a New Year's card game.) (New Year's card game.) Those who can't afford a horse... one by one we'll all fall behind. Working at the Kobe shipyards pays good money too. Village folk... are all saying they'll be the next to leave. It's not like that. Only Genzo and Gumbe ran away. Why be so negative? You're a chicken. Father... Father concentrate on a new job. Think about a good job. I'll go work in a thread factory and send money. Kurashiiki thread factory's always looking for new workers. You say a thread factory... I heard it's tougher than being in jail. I know it's tough. I'll leave tomorrow. I'll take Tomeko too... - Wait, wait. In April Kanegasaki thread factory sends a recruiter here. Better to be recruited. Waiting for April's a waste of time though. Forty days or fifty days, better to get started and earn something. Tomeko... you coming? Three more tries, then I'll smoke. - I've got it. - Got it. (Part of the same card game.) You in? You're coming. Don't force her to go through the deep snow. Mother... the snow won't stop us. She wants food more than flowers. - Yes, got it! (Playing the card game again.) I slept a cold, snowy night in the Jizo Shrine once. Right... it's decided. Tomeko... let's start packing. Why do so much for us. Because of your parents you suffered a lot. Mother... don't feel down, find your old spirit. Like when you pulled a cart before. We'll start first so you can start again... you realy must. Father... why don't you say something. Just one horse... endure and work hard. What are you doing? I told you before. Move over. Look at this. It's out of alignment. Ah... you fell asleep. How can you work like this. Smarten up. Tomeko... Fool... your pay got cut again. What to do... always screwing up. Why are you making that face? Look at me. Three months I managed three machines, and I didn't get even one bad flag. Sister, your special. I'm not special. You can't concentrate with this messy hair Hurry up and manage two or three machines. Be a good daughter and send back more than 15 yen a month. Become a supervisor... Before you make supervisor you'll die of lung disease. That's right. - Aha. Don't talk nonsense. We won't die. Sis... can I buy an egg at the kiosk. - No way. No you can't. Don't spend that kind of money. You should save it. At our age... mother had to pull a cart with only millet to eat. She couldn't even get a single lick of miso. But the two of us... once a day we get sardines or mackerel. It's a luxury for us right? Right? "... our life is worse than in prison. "Living in a factory hostel is even tougher. "Don't you folks look down on us thread factory ladies. "Thread factory ladies are devoted daughters..." Otoyo became a supervisor. The money that Otoyo and Tomeko sent back was helpful. But soon after the horse carts came... motorized vehicles began to be seen. Hurry up. Move it. Get out of the way! Now there's no way we can afford to keep pace with the times. Seki... big trouble. Seki... Natsuno-san is dead. - Eh... where?! This morning when she left to gather firewood on the mountain, she was fine. Shinzo said she just dropped down dead. It was she who taught me to care for my mother-in-law. She always knew how to support my inner feelings. She slipped away quietly like the morning dew. Like another blow of hard fate... Hatsuzo, who worked like a brother with Moichi, died. Another case of sudden death by stroke. I fell into a depression and became ill. They told me I had a stomach ulcer. Well... come inside. - Right. Seki... Get up for a minute. This is Ohina-san. Pleased to meet you. It's a shame you're not feeling well. She came from Oriyo's house. Well you see... her parents own a general store in Osaka. She's Oryo's... sister's daughter who left home. She was staying with some fellow. Come move in closer. It was such a low thing to do. He said he didn't want me with him anymore. Just dumped me. That's why I asked if I could be taken in here. So I came. - Oriyo-san... sent her here because you're not well. That's kind of her. Have a cup of tea. - Thank you. So Seki... for my part... I found a good place to work. Are you sure about it? What is it? On the mountain near the county line... there are a lot of trees good for making railway ties. A hundred men aren't enough to cut all the trees even in three winters. The work involves cutting them and hauling them to the main highway. That's good but... for you it's too tough. It'll make our district strong again. It's nothing I can't handle. The first thing I'll need is a crew. In order to have a crew... I'll have to get the guys back together. Hatsuzo brother is dead. I'm worried about what's happened to the others. What of it? This is a great job. Get better soon. You die, you'll miss the fun. If I can do this, it'll be springtime for me. Springtime for our family... I couldn't believe then... that it could really happen. But Moichi's new project succeeded. My illness also left like an old skin. I shed a little more each day. And springtime truly arrived for our family. The whole village enjoyed an active time. Our children also grew up. Each one chose their life and left home to work. Torao became a railway engineer. Sueko moved to Hiroshima and became a nurse. Our youngest, Saburo finished school. If his big brother drove a steam engine, he said he'd drive an electric tram. They all came home for 'Obon' and New Year. (summer festival This was our most precious joy. Waiting for them to come each year the years rolled past. Until suddenly we found ourselves at the O-bon festival of 'Showa 8'. (1933) I'm home. - Everyone's already here. Welcome home - Welcome home. You too. You too. Welcome home. You've become beautiful. Where are Otoyo an Toyoko? - They'll soon be here. You seem to be keeping busy. Yah, I was asked to mediate a big dispute between the hill communities. So I've been running here and there. Without his input nothing gets decided. If I don't do it, nobody else will. What about you, Torao? I heard railway employees are meeting about a union. Ah... they are. Our group might start one too. - Is that so. It's time you got married too, eh? How're things on the trams... Saburo? Ah... always top speed. He's having us on. Wouldn't want to ride on his tram. How's our nurse doing? I've been shifted to the surgery department. I'm pushing Sueko to be a midwife. Stop it, Mother. I'll marry a good doctor and we'll start our own clinic. A woman shouldn't be too ambitious. Sister's a real go-getter. Seki... give everyone some sake. I've prepared a real feast. I'll just get it. - No, no, Mom. Sit back down. Today you're the guest. Let me give you a treat. Looking for some sort of favour, eh? I'm back. Welcome, welcome. Everyone's here already. Otoyo...? Isn't she with you? What's going on? - What is it? You'll know when she gets here. It's been too long. How are you? Welcome home. What's going on? You haven't written for a long time. I'm quitting... no more babysitting. Did something happen? It's me, Mom... I want to be a hair stylist. Good, no? That's fine. So long as each of you follows your heart and lives happily... your mother will be happy. Drink, drink up. Shall we all dance together tonight. (Obon festival dance.) Why not? Let's do it. Torao... Saburo... you're still in you uniforms. Take them off and relax. Bring it to the hall. - Yes. Sis... give me a hand. Here. Saburo... Here... I need to let it out for you. You've grown since I last saw you. When I think about you... about you... even a sunny day clouds over. And then, and then... The brightly moonlit night... becomes completely dark. Such a crazy, crazy guy. Mom... let's get going. - Right, let's go. On this side, this gentleman over here... raised in a sheltered life... And then, and then... All night long he keeps hunting... Drawing back his bow. Such a crazy, crazy guy. Mom... look it's sister. Brother, sister... big sister! On this side, this gentleman over here... Sorry, I came late. You're so busy, it must be hard for you. No, no. Not that bad. Mom... come. What is it, Otoyo? Just for a minute. I have something to tell you. I've decided to get married. - Well! Why didn't you say anything? NAKAI Katsuji is his name. He works in our factory kitchen. Let's have a look at him. Ohh, so that's him. Young! One year younger than me. We went to a fortuneteller. Born in the year of the Tiger, he's determined. He's not afraid of anything. We are very compatible. If we pool together, we can use our severance pay... to open a restaurant in Osaka. A restaurant is a good money earner. Well, maybe you have your objections, but I'll be settled and I won't be a problem for you. It's okay, no? No...? Factory workers are special... They care about their parents. But, all the same... you could've discussed it a little with us. As a child we put you though a lot of trouble. I've been thinking a lot about what we could do to help you. Don't give it another thought. I'm not expecting even a wedding dress from you, but... you both come together to the wedding. And his parents? Her mother-in law caused mom to shed a lot of tears. So she's worried. His parents live with his elder brother. He's the second son. Well... I'd be happy to serve my mother-in-law. I made ready wedding clothes for both of you... that's why I ended up getting so late late. Father... Oh my! Kawauchi-ya 'kimono'... - Yes. (Formal robe) Chuten-ya 'hakama'? (Formal leggings) How will I piss wearing these? Luxurious. If I put these on, I'll be young again. - Oh my! Mother... try this on. Let's try them on. Ah, it's fine. The obi? No no. - On no. Mom, here. Suits you perfectly. It's all so perfect. There's nothing for me to say or do. I hope you'll be very happy. It's all I can say. Not here! - Shit! Where's she gotten to? - Don't be jealous. You'll find another girl. Come on. Let's go. A long time ago two lovers had a secret tryst... Who are they to tell me what to do? Screw them. Sabu-chan, let's sit here. - Sure. How many years, since we came here. - I was in grade six. Back then... I had it in my mind that I would to be your wife. That so? - I'm serious. So then... now... It's nice that guy followed me. Suzue-san... why not marry me. It's too soon. At least... we can promise... no? Your Mom, will she scold you? She's pretty scarry. She does what she wants to do... but she's very strict with us. Sabu-chan... your mom? My mom will do whatever I want... so don't worry. Can I get 2 liters? - Sure, sure. Your children have all come back, eh? - Yes. Careful. Saburo... Your mom! What is it, Mom. Isn't she Sazue from Rio-san's house? She is. Don't get too close to girls like that. Thank you as usual. - Thank you. Your children are all doing well, aren't they? Hatsuzo-san's passing's a real shame. Now there's no one to watch Moichi and keep him in line. Keep my husband in line? - Yaah. Look at this. Sugar, sweets, and preserves too. He bought all this? - Yaah. But I never saw any of this at home. - Is that so? Maybe it was for his work crew. For them to eat and drink. You don't know? It's that Ohina. Every evening he takes things to her house. It can't be... not her. Not with that granny. - Yes it can be. Men are so greedy. I was going to do it alone... but the border guard came and I had to run. That's great. That story makes me want to pee. Aha, by the moonlight... I was waiting, come on... come on. You're back already. Kompira temple... Dear... I hear you're having an affair with Ohina. but not... a sound... Is it true? Who said that? Idiot! OBON FESTIVAL LANTERN Tonight... is very lively and full of fun. What's up, Seki-san? Kiyo-san... you're terrible. What d'you mean? Since when did you start being a love broker. Don't say nasty things about me. That's what you are. What were you thinking matching my husband with Ohina. Oseki-san... don't say such terrible things. I didn't do any such thing. Moichi-san came of his own accord. There's no woman more unfortunate than I. I'll tell you now. I... thought I could count on Moichi marrying me. You stole him away. How bitter I felt toward you. I didn't come to hear your story. Listen just for a minute. Heartbroken, I gave up and married someone. Not much of a man, that one. That one left me. The second one died on me. I have no one to depend on. After facing all that... everynight Moichi and Ohina get lovey-dovey in front of me. I... would love to be the hussy you came to mock. This Kyo woman... she's so persitent, I had no way out. So then... she matched me with Ohina. Don't lie. It's true. I thought if I agreed to it... she'd give up. Her dad, back when Ryo and I were friendly... that guy teased her. She'd die before she'd release her hooks... what could I do? It happened like that... You should understand. I don't. Makes no sense at all to me. Don't start that. Not tonight! Leave me alone. I'm a woman who can at least weave charcoal bags. Unlike most people living here... we've finally managed to have a nice life. What's going on here? It's festival time. What's this? What? Huh? Good morning. - Morning. Seki... Say Seki... They kicked her out of Oryo's place. Ohina that is. What do you think? You're not very strong. Let her help you. Uh... you can use her for whatever you need. I'll... never accept. Come Seki... Let's ask everyone. Don't raise your voice. Shame on you. Stop, father. Mother... Torao, Saburo... Let's move out. Father, don't! Stop, stop! - Don't. - Don't! Stop it. What's happened? I asked... since Ohina has nowhere to go, can't she stay here. That's no solution. Other people won't see it like that. Father... - Yah... Father, if you want to stay here no matter what... don't have her as a mistress, marry her. We won't say anything. But mother will come to live with us. Okay? Father, whatever it is, you don't listen to us. I won't say anything. If you don't want mother please say so. She can live with us. Seki... you are lucky. But I don't want you to stay with the children. But Father... - Can't you put up with it? It just happened. I don't hate you. Seki... Please listen. Please listen. Mother... Otoyo... what hurts so much is... I married him for love. Now he takes a mistress. What could be more painful? I cannot leave this house. It wasn't built by your father alone. I remember struggling to pull a cart for thirty years. I can't. - Mother! After that every day... Moichi and I stayed under one roof. But as strangers. - Thank you. I shut my eyes to whatever happened. In the afternoon I tried to work in the fields. In the evening I listened to the radio Saburo sent me... and tried to forget about it all. Do you want some too? - Yes, thank you. Have a hot one. - Okay. Sleeping out the entrance... why on earth? I'm just an employee. The entrance hall's enough for me. I'm going for a piss. It's really cold. You'll catch... cold... sleeping out here. Thank you. "Bravely say that you will win. "Swear that you will win before you return to your home. "Everyone believes you'll distinguish yourself. "Everytime the bugle sounds the advance... "See you mother's face before you." ...on top of that my shoulder is stiff. Please give it a rub. Thank you very much. Mother... My call-up papers came. GOOD LUCK IN BATTLE Now, along with Torao, we've given two sons for our country. You know, Father... What's that? In fact... - Yah... Before I go... I want to tell you... I want to get married and fix my future now. Come, sit over here. You're single now... you'd better decide quickly. Who are you thinking of. She... lives near us. That's good, that's good. Our other children moved far away to work and married there. There's no one I can visit easily. At least you'll marry one of our local girls. You're great. Where's this girl from? She lives opposite the shrine... Suzue-san. Ryo-san's daughter? You mean Suzue? - Yes. Suzu-chan... that's good, that's good no? You... please leave for now. Grandpa...? Where should I go? - Better you stay here. Saburo... is it okay if this woman sits in on our family discussion? No it's not... but Father said yes. Right. I see. I'm glad. I'm glad. It's your decision... better discuss it with your father. Mother... Mother, please... Mother... sorry. It's my fault. It was selfish of me. - It's okay, it's okay. I have nothin to say. Marry the one you love. So... you accept my decision? When you go to war, take care of your health. Don't drink unboiled water. It'd be a waste if you die. Hello. - Hello. Good, good. That's fine. Suzue's now the wife of an army man. Sabu-chan... tonight you receive Suzue before everyone. That's right. - Now the whole world knows. Right... Now you're married whatever will be, will be. Nobody knows what the future will bring. Give it your best tonight. Fire your cannon, eh. I'll take the sake. Auntie now they're all married. You can relax. - Thank you. Ah... good! More sake's coming. You've worked hard. - Yes, yes. "By the grace of Tsu, Ise is sustained. "By the grace of Ise, Tsu is sustained." "By the grace of the castle Nagoya area is sustained." "The golden fish on the roof." Banzai! - Banzai! - Banzai! (Banzai = Live long! - lit.Ten thousand years!) "War comarade who died with a smile on his face." "Long live the emperor." "Bravely return victorious..." Saburo... don't lose to anyone! Hirayama Saburo... banzai! - Banzai! Such a pretty woman waiting for you. Don't forget. I'm going, I'm going. Mom... stay well. Breaking news... Announcement from Headquarters... Announcement from Headquarters. Showa 18 (1943) December 5th, 06:30 pm Last November 9th, soldiers of the Japanese Empire landed on Tarawa and Makine Islands. They were defended by 50,000 enemy soldiers. Hey, go to bed. We bombed them heavily and advanced. Our assault team caused heavy damage. Don't catch a chill. All died honourably rather than surrender. Rear Admiral Keiji Shimazaki was their commander. Saburo... What happened to you? Hernia...? How dare you come back so shamelessly. What happened? You show your face here after everyone's donations. How can you? What happened, Saburo? Before even fighting he failed his medical because of a hernia. He's no child of mine. What'll we say? How'll I show my face now? That's true. If someone sees you standing out here it won't look good... come inside. I won't allow him inside. If he can't even serve his country... he's no son of mine. - Father... Get out! Out! Out! Seki... he's not allowed in. Saburo is my son... son of this house. Saburo, come, come. Seki! It's because of just such situations... that I stayed here even though I have to live with his mistress. Sit. Granpa... won't you do anything? Mom... Useless fellow. He's really uselss. - You're too right, useless. I'll go tell Su-chan. You know, Saburo... when you said you wanted to marry Suzue... I was so preoccupied with Ohina... I became very emotional. I almost left this house. But it's good... that I stayed. I'm sorry Mom. What are you saying? Even though they sent you back... there are other ways that you can serve your country. You must be hungry. I'll make your favourite mixed rice, okay? Hey, what will you do? Eh...? Sabu-chan was sent home? To the family's utter disgrace. He should have held the hernia in. Suzue-san... go and tell him whatever you feel like. A problem, eh? In my last years... I'm forced to face shame. It's truly an ugly situation... getting rejected because of a hernia. I can't show my face to the neighbours. Saburo... You get out! Get out! Granpa... Coward... you've no right. I said get out! What are you doing? Agh... you fool. You keep a mistress, humiliating my mother. How dare you! It's for me to decide. You have no right to say anything. - Father... My hernia can be repaired by an operation. When I'm cured, I'll volunteer and go. Only... I can't leave, knowing this old bag is here. It kills my will to fight. Father... make this right. Let me go to war... with a clear mind. Clearly you all feel I should leave. I will leave. I have nowhere to go. I'll live under a bridge and beg if I have to. Granpa... I'm leaving now. Ohina-san... - Mother, let her go. If she begs or whatever... it's not our worry. Ohina-san... - Leave me alone. Suzue... She's not allowed in my house. Mother... Do you have to leave so late at night. I have to reach Meishi by morning. Give father my regards. So, I'll be off. Don't cry. Saburo got his hernia operated on. He didn't return to our home... but immediately volunteered and went to war. He died in Okinawa. The atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. Moichi hurried there to look for our Sueko. Even so... he never found her. "Air raid warning, take shelter. Air raid warning, take shelter." Seki... Seki... Even after all this time... you never lose your patience. Please accept this cup. You're still angry at me? Seki... husband and wife... many things can happen to muddy the waters... but water clears. We can start over again, no? Ohina and I are different. I'm a woman with a bug inside me. A woman with a bug deep inside, that is. And then finally the war came to an end. We received no information whether Torao had died in battle. But he had still not returned. Seki... finally... we no longer have to pay land tax. Below Miyanseko we had 4 'tan'. (1 tan = about 1 hectare or 1/4 acre.) Isiyan was two and a half tans. Nochika also... all of it... now belongs to us. For 48 years we continued to grow rice. But it was never our land. It's a gift from heaven. Father, let's go. What's wrong? Today your face looks swollen. Take rest why don't you. - No. It's not good to delay the planting. Father... Father... Father... The blood... the blood's leaving my head. It hurts. - Stay strong. Let me be... just for a little. Seki... My hand... it's gone completely numb. You've been... so patient... with me... right to the end. What d'you mean? Don't say such a sad thing. No... I know... I'm done for. What are you talking about? Remember when we were pulling the carts together... pull your strength back, father. When we saw the doctor... He just said,"his spleen is swollen". Some unknown sickness. He continued to cough up blood, and died near his children who had rushed to be with him. Now I suspect... that when he went to Hiroshima to look for Sueko... he very likely contracted radiation sickness. Grandpa. Now the funeral's over we can get back to normal. And you guys can all return home. - That's right. Mom, you'll be lonely now. Come stay with us. What're you saying, Tomeko? Mom will never leave this house... right? If only Torao comes back alive... how nice, Sa-san. Right. I'll take care of Grandma. So sisters, you can be at ease going home. Seki... can I ask a favour of you? What would that be? Ohina came... she wants to offer prayers to Moichi. No, no! How can she? It's alright. Tell her she can come. Mom! - It's okay, I say. Now I don't hate her anymore. She's a pitiable old person now. Hina-san... quickly. Ohina-san... it's nice of you to come to say prayers for him. If you hate anyone, it should be me. Thank you. Thank you. Come. Please offer your prayers. Hey, put him on. Grandma, please get on. - Grandma, please get on. Granny, Grany. Granny get on. To remember Grandpa let's make 'sasa rice balls'. (Sweet rice balls steamed in bamboo leaves.) Heave ho, heave ho, heave ho. (continues) Everyone, get on. We'll get some firewood and some sasa. Granny, will you be okay? I can still pull it, even with all you on. Little baby crow why are you always calling. Calling out... to auntie hen. I want a red hat just like you. And red shoes just like you. So calls the baby crow. Mom! Torao. Mother!
