Balaraman, yes a vehicle has come is it? what a high fever! He has also vomited some blood tests have been done don't know the details how is he now? the difficulties have subsided a little bit can we see uncle now? not allowed to see him even in daytime, then how is it possible at night? one cannot go past that accountant Menon who is guarding him. on receiving the telegram l thought it is serious why simply troubling us Menon, when he catches just a fever and cold? no, now a days we must be careful even if it is a sneeze there should not be space for complaints if anything happens that Menon did not inform us is sister, children and all here? where else will they go? everybody is here even the His Highness old Mathilakam uncle has reached with grandson Balaraman ha ha ha ha. so Subhadra Varma from Madras too has arrived, ha ha ha ha Does anybody remain? Janaki had a son one black Varma in Bombay what about him? it seems he hasn't come; because such a man was not seen in the mess hall no, there is no question of him not coming grandpa,yes, don't we have to present our case before uncle His Highness dies? Yes we have to, but wait, but wait one vehicle has come, it seems yes, its an auto rickshaw it must be him who?

How is uncle? they say he is better, how can we know the truth? hope mom and dad were with uncle only how is it possible? We were allowed to see him only once why? His Highness is getting more short-tempered and stubborn as be grows older now he doesn't like us that secretary Raman Menon is more powerful than His Highness. it should have been nice if our Guptan gets some money or land before brother dies that accountant Menon told that His Highness has fixed everybody's share in his will, but will get it only after his death. whom else to give? No children. And Her Highness needs no money or property l am sure that share of sustenance has been allocated are you sure? yes, we will be given a bit more than what he gives to others Because brother Highness is one who respects art and artists. another thing is that l am the only Brahmin who had married a woman from this family even now, l will be given a gift if l perform Kathakali when he is in a good mood, see, you remember this ring? that was his present in recognition of my enactment of Roudra Bhima you are in fool's paradise oh lord, My brother had selected such a foolish Namboodiri for me. though you are born in a Royal family, it is you who is a fool brother Highness knows very well for what you, your sisters, and their husbands are roaming around brother will like us if we remain cool without showing greed for money and property. also his soft corner for me as an artist l am sure that if he gives anything with pleasure, it will be to us. Mom, you feel cold? please dry mom's hair once again Saraswati, let me take that saffron box l will take the saffron box Her Highness will get annoyed in the morning itself if l dry her hair enough, lt's time for Unni's arrival His face will turn dark if l won't wait in the balcony when he comes have you seen Unni, my girl? no Unni is fooling all of us he is mischievous how many days have l been waiting like this? here comes Unni. good morning that's prince guptan What? son of princess Madhavi tell him to go away Unni won't come today also, is it?

Then what about your studies? Studies come only after this His Highness is my first preference l was really shocked hearing about his illness ha ha ha. Menon, squeeze some onion into his eyes let him cry lavishly don't tease, He is the successor of His Highness Knowing that very well, my dear brother His Highness named him Raja Raja Varma who will become the Highness after Udaya Varma? Subhadra's son? Ha ha ha l am the eldest among the nephews Not only that, he is not born to a low-caste father His father is an original Varma of Attingal palace. though my husband is low-caste, He is well-educated and dignified unlike your husband who is not well off please stop it. this is why he is not allowing to see him See, l'll tell His Highness if you are again going to quarrel and that will be the end of your entry to this palace, l warn Where were you my girl? l was with mom His Highness has been asking about you for some time,Go to him that low-cast girl has all the freedom, calling the King dad, calling the queen mom, we born of the same blood ignored. hmm.

Kunjikrishnan, Yes my lord you may go as you wish. sisters and children have come, they insist to see you for what? aren't they satisfied with what they have seen? an abnormal lady is living here, nobody wants to see or hear her how can we say no to people who have come from afar? let them come when l die tell them everybody's share is allocated what a disturbance! in the end Bhagirathi will become orphan don't forget her even after my death though not your mother, you are used to call her so consider her as your mother. l know you will l too have seen you as daughter, not as adopted daughter Menon, shall l take a bath? you can, but you want it today itself? yes l want, the present uneasiness is because l am not taking bath l will take medicine and breakfast only after that you pluck flower just like Kalamandalam, Appukutty Aasan's Damayanthi doing it, in Nalacharitham Kathakali. hey, your face is blushed why troubling me like this? troubling? why Radha says like this? l am saying so out of love you need not like me, please go Princess Madhavi will scold me if she sees this l am the love beetle roaming around the beautiful flower called Radha, A beetle, beetle Hello beetle, what's this?

She was telling, dont do for today. don't you know her? lt's my daughter. yes, l know. Once you had told me you're learning dance, is it? so take rest, Kunjikrishna you may come Kunjikrishna, don't forget to give food and gift to that orchestra team is food ready? will be ready by the time you take bath everybody is here how are you uncle?

We will talk at a convenient time. look, l have to say gone Brother didn't even allow to give your face don't cry. l am happy to know that you all have come Kesava pillai, why unnecessarily took trouble by taking leave and spending money? how can we remain comfortable there, after knowing that you are not well? leave and expenses does not matter at all in this issue Rajan was very eager to see his uncle you become fat Ambika keeps on crying where is she? smart girl; are you studying well? yes so we will see in detail before you leave l, mom and Ambika are planning not to return but this man will be alone there no? that's no problem. l too am fed-up with Madras Brother, Ravi has come from Bombay He came from Bombay by flight, immediately after he got information, about your illness. oh, are you traveling by aero plane now? now you really look like a Bombay walla l was shocked, Uncle. Why? You thought l am dead? uncle! don't say such hard words; l can't bear it l was just kidding man. Ha ha ha. why Namboodiri lagged behind? l always stays in back row our plan is to admit Guptan in Kalamandalam before that we want to know your opinion at least l should follow uncle's line isn't it? all the other nephews are useless guys, without any sense of art. so, l am happy l was worried if this art and literature will perish, anyway its good that such a man has emerged. did uncle really mean it, or was it a dig at me? He really mean it. Menon, why you wanted to see me urgently? there is news l came across one thing while searching a file in the shelf what? ls it any gem? yes, something like that certain documents of property agreements so all the hearsay is true what is our share? couldn't read in detail that accountant Menon was with me still l did a rough scan within the limited time the palace and agricultural lands are, allocated in the names of Princess Janaki, Princess Subhadra, and Princess Mathu. Dad, we must somehow manage to, include the Nilgiri estate to our part, for that can't we exchange other agricultural lands? No, there is a separate document for estate that is in the name of Radhika and Her Highness Bhagirathi the vacant palace in Nilambur is also in their names all these will turn out to be Radhika's asset after the death of Her Highness to that low-cast girl? how can that girl, born as a bastard to sweeper Nair woman, have right over royal properties? that l don't know what a contemptible act has this uncle did! ask such things to His Highness directly l will ask, that's another thing deserving nephews other than me also here.l will make them join me. look Pillai, l am doing such favors, considering our maternal relation. this is my bread and butter. Don't spoil it. you don't worry. l will take care of you. my concern is in losing the estate you won't lose it l have calculated some plans for it in a sense it is good that the estate is written in the name of Radha so it will not have to be divided into three. l didn't understand anything you won't understand anything Once Radha becomes a member of our family, the estate will automatically become part of ourfamily property My Goddess, What a brain lt's not my idea, this is the brain behind it l am not getting a chance to talk to you in privacy. Where are you hiding? Any custom that you cannot come in front of human beings? no. please stay there. l was thinking of telling certain things. Wont your mind become stunted? by staying here continuously? We all have only one life. all these worldly pleasures must be experienced in our life time. don't you want? l am comfortable here. what comfort? cooking and serving to the King and the Queen thrice daily? l will take you to Bombay one day. dad is calling. don't go. Radha, do you think you can manage the estate in Nilagiri alone? estate? yes. why should l manage it all? then who else will look after the estate in the name of Radha? l am even ready to settle down in Nilagiri after constructing a bungalow there. the climate is very nice there. Oh, God! l don't understand anything. Oh, l see! You might have followed her. yes. l will tell aunt, that you are indulging in dirty things. l don't mind. you better not indulge in dirty things. how dare you advise me? you may go. there is a rumor, that there is some settlements, regarding properties. l would like to know the truth. whatever you heard is right. the will is registered. all the assets except the estate, are in the name of 3 sisters and others. estate is in the name of Radhika, Her Highness, and Malathi. and some unaccounted gold and money. that will be divided equally. but you will get only after the King's death. you are getting the alimony regularly. so we will get it only after his death. Know? the astrological calculation shows that, there is a chance for him, to die at the age of 84. after that even the lord of death, cannot touch him until the age of 96. so we better take 96. so we will have to wait for 1 0-36 years. by that time all of us will be dead. we are all going to live, at the most for another 1 0 years. now itself there are signs of weakness. Guptan, no use in staying awake. Go to sleep. don't desire the King's property. dad, please sit. Don't go. we shall meet uncle and present our case. ask for immediate disbursal of the due. yes. You ask for share, and he will give it instantly. what a fool you are, my Guptan! don't you know uncle after all these years? that old man is a ghost, who guards his treasure. think about anything practical. why not file a case? we have to prove that old man is insane like his wife, then the written will become invalid. dad, if we proceed with the case, we will lose whtever is due to us. don't think of foolish plans. then what will we do? no, nothing doing. live comfortably with regular food, and sleep. That's all. if you give one share to me, and Balaraman, l will tell you an idea. will you give me? will give, definitely. will give, definitely. war is the duty of a warrior. we must fight a war. there's nothing wrong in killing someone during a war. its an honour. what? kiling? that too your own uncle? haven't you heard of the story of, Krishnan annihilating his uncle Kamsan? haven't you heard of Arjunan shooting the holy arrow on, the chest of his brother Karnan? that was not unrighteousness. there is no discretion at war whether it is your father, son, uncle or nephew there is only your enemy. the enemy. what's that? why at this odd-hour? you look really horrified. what happened? Tell me. l saw a dream. Oh, that's all? dad, you should be careful. there are enemies around you. shame what's this? Why worrying like this, just after seeing a dream Nothing will happen. l know that all the faces, laughing around are insincere. all are interested in property. not because l don't like to give. am l going to take all these properties along with my life? but when seeing their greed once you are married to a responsible person, l don't worry in dying. go and sleep. who did the last move? if you don't feel sleepy, l shall sit with you No. then go and sleep. this is my routine. you said you have 2 month's leave, and why leaving so suddenly? l have an urgent matter. Will return after 3-4 days. but why don't you tell a word to uncle? don't waste time for that. Come. if he asks about me, you may tell him. oh, he has no time to care about you. Leave fast without wasting time. no. you need not come. 3 people starting together is a bad omen. Ravi has come. Praise the lord! do you remember what l said? Yes, don't think that Udayavarma, is just an old man. though he don't have the power, and glamour, he still is a king. he has that position. not only that, he is honored in government level. A small mistake, and you are all will be in jail. this poor blind man will be spared. His death should be executed, in such a way that it should be, either related to senility, or by an accident. not even a trace of murder, should be left behind. will it be possible? it must be possible. anyone can kill anybody. Even you can do that. the one who is assigned for the task... must be a professional. he must be wise and skilled. no one should doubt him. by his personality and behavior Forget this plan. if you don't get such an ideal candidate. lt wont be difficult in Bombay. Bombay is the land of underworld kings. Do you know that, grandpa? what do this blind man know? l am reminding you one thing again. Unity is strength. it's better for all of us if we stay together. don't reveal anything to the women at all. l won't tell Madhavi even if my head is gone. so, shall l go, grandpa? wish you all the best wish you all the best lt's good l don't want lt's good don't want lt's made in Japan how much? 400, 500 and 600 very costly! hey, please come man. What a bad omen l had today! Highness? Highness, where were you? you want anything? New Japanese items are here. nothing now. l have come in search of another man. Mamachan? You like duplicates? not that l want to see that Kabeer dada. An urgent matter Kabeer dada. you didn't know the news? what? he's jailed is it? the whole gang is in jail for murdering a Marwadi why decent royal people are in dada's company? that's, for another reason say openly, what ever be you need l will arrange. you insist on Kabeer? No not like that Say clearly You will get enough goondaas in Bombay. tell me isn't this a matter you yourself can handle? ls it necessary to hire a goonda, from Bombay to kill a 60-year old man? Things are not as simple as you think Uncle is a King, having high status in society everybody will be arrested, if anybody sense doubt in our moves So the plan should be executed very carefully in short, u mean it should be a silent death, is it? OK, let's see Choudhary Saahib, are you fine? fine Look him waiter give us some water first, sure sir that man is suitable-Choudhary Saahib. How is he? Or else, the man sitting next to him, Sunder Singh. Both are good. How is he? if you want, the deal can be finalized and the advance paid now itself. No, no. l don't want him. he is having an outlook of a goonda do you think goondas will have Prem Nazir's looks? Coudhary has the better looks, than others but to stay in the palace, one requires a decent personality. if you insist on the perfect person, l will have to come Oh, what a charm, Stop joking. Tell me if you can arrange or not. Or else l have to look for other alternatives. so you didn't like none of these guys? there's a man. But we must convince him. who is it? a demon. But if we get him convinced, done. He will kill the man smoothly it's not like butchering chicken and goats He knows how to do it systematically and he is not the type of killing directly. will kill only if all the conditions are suitable. how does he look? He looks exactly like you. Oh! Yes, and he is well built. His color is golden, not black like you. His face is round, not like your's then why did you say he looks like me? l was just giving a rough idea. now where is he? song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song song What are you telling brother? How can i kill a human atleast even i didn't kill any chiken yet My god, l can't even think of it. haven't you told me that you want to, regain your ancestral home after making, some money by finishing off someone? that was just my wish dear Jamaal. Just a wish? See, a word should be a word. Do you know that most of the millionaires, in Bombay have amassed money, by killing and stealing! l'm still doing this meager business, because l don't have the guts to do so. Believe, it's the God who gave this chance. and not because there are no goondaas... in Bombay. we don't have the right, to annihilate God's creations. if so, do we have the right, to relinquish the 2 lakh rupees, that God gives to us? Abdulla, lf you are saying philosophy, l too have certain things to say. The Koran says: Your name is written... on every single grain that you eat. Do you know what is meant by that? you are destined to get this 2 lakh rupees. if you give a share of it to me, l also will get the benefit. Please agree this deal. anyway, don't reject this offer. l will tell you the rest. Come. Don't worry, come. please come. Highness, you are really a lucky man. How ever i made him agree now it's your turn to explain to him... the details of your plans. l also will reach there, at then right moment, if needed. what say? adjust your cloth properly Unni Wows, isn't it Unni? no then who?

Princess? then what should l call? l am seeing a palace a king, a queen, and a princess for the first time. so l don't have an idea how to behave. see l am not a princess then who are you? me, me, l am a woman living in everybody's mercy oh, l see so what should l call you now? Radha hi, Radha? ha.ha.ha, it's Fine. so where are lady companions? you didn't tell me the way out. go this way, and you'll find a ladder get down to a corridor that lands to a small dining hall turn left; there you'll see the verandah, of the Bungalow. on the right side is a well l'll tell you the way. asking for the way, inside the queen's bedroom? you seem to be a jovial type. nothing of the sort. still there is a little bit. if so you better stop it you have been ordered to see him. whom? who else to order here, other than His Highness? the real King Udayavarma. don't you know, that l don't like strangers? Reverence to uncle, and the zest to become closer to you. that's why l brought him here Ok, it is not because of that. still, isn't it improper to allow, strangers to live inside this home? but look, Uncle, you are an admirer of arts, he is an artist. so there is propriety of artistic meeting? besides, he is interested in various subjects, such as the architectural aspects and the historical background, of our palace. for that where else can he go? what is your relation with Plakkurissi illam? at Plakkurissi illam my name is Ananthan Namboodiri, Nambhoodiri not that l asked, how you are related to, Krishnan Namboodiri. Vamadevan Namboodiri has married,Krishnan Namboodiri's daughter. And he is related to this man, How are you grandpa? grandpa, grandpa, he is no more. died? don't say bull shit. l had seen him at Guruvayoor last month. No. he is not dead.

Let him go after staying here for one or two days. as you wish. are you hygienic kind of a person? extremely hygienic. the youngsters need not be so. why are you staring at me like this? no, nothing. lt is midnight. l came to see what you are doing, staying awake. nothing, l couldn't sleep. you seem to be restless. me? no, nothing of the sort. then switch off the light and go to sleep. Hands up was it you? all of you would have been died now. be careful while handling this. lt's dangerous. Does that Raman Menon have any doubt? l didn't feel so. Beware of the dwarfs! They are very cunning. don't leave us to risk. don't worry. On a good morning you will know, that the king Udaya Varma is dead. Remember, l must get the reward without dues, the moment his burial starts. Or else all of you will be in danger, as you said. No, we will not deceive you. You will be paid, more than what you are offered. if so, you go to sleep. Let me plan things. come this is the routine. l will reach only half the way, when all the others finish. You too are eating well. have some more butter milk. give him some butter milk. did you like the curries? really fine; especially the curd curry. Why paayasam today? Any special occasion? paayasam is a regular item in the menu. is it? So l'm lucky. Today's preparation was, under Saudamini's supervision. who is Saudamini? Me. really nice. Delicious like her. Saudamini is satisfied. You are praised by a Namboodiri, from a renowned family. what a charistmatic face, lt's full of elegance of a Brahmin. Ravi said he is a scholarly person. The only son of a renowned family. who? Ananthan Namboodiri. hmm he is famous. But not sure in which field. careful. Your calculations may go wrong. its right that one namboodiri doesn't like... another of the same caste. sister, if you think that they are matching, why not proceed? did you call me, uncle? yes. called. Did your friend leave? no why? he doesn't feel like leaving. that's not right. l don't like a grown up man roaming, around like this in a place. where young women live. Tell him to leave. no, uncle. He is not a problem man. He is very decent no more explanation l allowed him to stay here for two days. Now what? nothing, he, Menon will tell him if you find it difficult.

Let me hear. who invited you now to this scene? what? You only invited me, to this place no? get lost. What a disturbance. Radha, Radha, look, if she doesn't like you, then why are you following her? don't talk to me. You are the main reason behind Radha's dislike to me. you have the egoistic feeling. that you are an artist. A man with good voice. need not be a good singer. There is a limit for patience. Mind it you monkey. you only look like a monkey. our knowledge is that there is no musician, as great as you in South lndia. it was recognized by the Government and the people also. Without that you won't get all these, awards and Padmasree. but that Ananathan Namboodiri says that, all these were arranged by, the power of money. oh, l see you must come to the palace one day. we can't bear the haughtiness, of that monkey. That's why l came in person. then l want to see him. Kochurama, lets go to the palace. ok, we will go. fine but the lack of practice is very evident. it's long since l read you should practice daily.

But you should not be proud. l don't understand what you say. l will make you understand. l would like to sing with you. Kochurama, yes l am not for a competition. l have heard that music is an ocean. l am a boy standing amused, on the banks of it.

This is a cunning trick. what do you gain by calumniating like this? do you know what did that Ananthamurthy, told about you? no no he was wondering how a thistle did grow, up in such a beautiful garden. severe beating is the apt medicine, for such behavior. please don't scold him. He might have done it for a joke. what pastime? ls misleading decent people a joke? as that Moorthy said, l will cut down this thistle if l happen, to hear such things about you. understand? yes what yes? donkey, see mister, today we will have dinner together.

Accepted as my real daughter she is equal to a thousand sons. l want some one to take care of her, even after my death. she is not at all ambitious but l know she likes you very much. my lord, l am not the person as you think. l am happy. you are like my Unni now. careful my Unni would have been your age, if he was alive today. and your color. as innocent face like this. you held my hand when l wavered. this is my Unni's hand. this is my Unni's hand. isn't it so? you are drunken too much bull shit. what a foolishness did you do? it was a desolate palce. midnight you could have finished him of, by just pushing him down.

Don't forget it. you set out knowing this no? yes Just killing a man is simple. anyone can do You want me to kill you now? l will do it without anyone else noticing it. what are you upto? l was just saying what? there must be a change. be it music or murder, l always want to do things in a novel way. l could have killed him yesterday but what use in resorting to old, conventional ways? a killer always want to have, mental satisfaction. bull shit. We spend money not for a killer's mental satisfaction. for our plans materialize. don't worry. you need to own the property, isn't it? let me talk to His Highness.

You better be a parish priest or a preacher. shall l tell a truth, dear friend? l also feel like becoming one. l will tell a truth. you may be thinking that, we members of the royal family are simple. warriors' blood flows through our veins. We don't mind killing and being killed. We won't spare you if you try to fool us. Understand? You donkey! hey, highness hey, what oh!

He says he can't carry out the assassination. what? yes that's the truth. l cannot kill anybody. l am not a killer then for what did you come to this place, accepting the advance amount? To shave? Ravi varma.. let him say what he has to say. nothing in detail. We have defected. not you, let him say. l have no experience killing any body. l tried my best to do that, but my limbs are shivering. l am a poor singer. l agreed to take up this task because, l was badly in need of money. l have spent only 1 000 rupees from, the advance. l will give back the rest. shall we settle things in a peaceful way? l will kill and bury both of you dogs! Kesavapillai, it is wise to keep mum sword should be fought with a sword and, an arrow should be tackled with , another arrow. let the boys go. don't show off citing similes. l have seen a lot of dadas in Bombay. me too yes, so we are not going to withdraw in fear. l became a bit closer to His Highness. not only that, since we have decided to retreat, isn't it fair to reveal the intention behind our visit we should keep manners every where. You may go only after enjoying life.. with Udayavarma for a few more days. so shall we go? you may go my dear boys didn't l warn you that sweetness, is increasing? now see what has happened will they be dangerous uncle? the control is still at our hands don't be late l run out of ideas, my lord l had told them itself that this, ill be a foolishness.

Leave here at once. Or else, l will kill you. how can we trust people. brother Jamal, we are not going to leave this palace, until the destiny is clear. any idea where has His Highness gone? isn't he in the bed room? no he may be in deep sleep. Radha searched for him everywhere. Has he left for Nilagiri? in that case he would have told me. ls the car there in the shed? yes did he say anything about going, afar to see Kathakali? no then where did he go? tell frankly, Mr.Pillai why should we hide it from each other? Menon, l swear, l don't know anything heard that some others have come? l don't know anything. Uncle and Ravivarma are planning, and deciding everything. l will go to Madras if l get the ticket need not murmur to me. l am not for any trouble. that's good. Then why should l bother? Those who give girls to these guys, from this palace must be beaten. certain secrets will be come out, if some people are given nice. what is the matter? now what to do? Shall we inform the police, Mr. Menon? l also thought so. Let's wait for one more day.yes, yes what is this, dear girl. Are you crying when your , marriage is fixed? Saraswati, how much jasmine flowers are stocked? Please tell the young princess to meet me when she comes from Venad. don't cry in front of mom, dear girl. dad will come back before tonight. don't think of unnecessary things. Abdulla, Abdulla some important people have come. who is that? come that way. that fair guy is Kabirdada.He is a Gujarathi. He is a good man. the man next to him is his right hand. Chandran nair. He is a Malayali. He too is a good man. l don't the name of the man next to him. But he is a real rascal. Rascal means booldy rascal. l had a fight with him once. haven't you seen them before? no ha, these are the people to meet. They are good people. They will fight with hand. They learned stunt from Japan. they may spare Jamal don't mind it. lf they have targeted you, they will finish off you. Business is business. relation and friendship is another thing. l was wondering when they reached here. they might have reached 2-3 days back. Kabir won't come without getting, a clear idea about the place. what should we do now? what is the use of asking what to do now, when you are swallowed almost full into, the tiger's stomach. my god, Abdulla, he too gone? Abdulla Abdulla tell me where is His Highness l don't know where he is. leave me Kabir bhai. l am not Kabir bhai to you now. l am an executioner. Why not saying? leave me. l will tell where he is. tell me where is His Highness Tell me am asking, tell me where is His Highness l don't know Tell me Tell me Tell me, why don't you tell me? walk fast Balarama where are you Balarama? grandpa where are you? Balarama, Oh my stick is lost. Hey Balarama, my stick. dad ho dad son Oh my son go be quick Madhavi, madhavi Balarama, where did you go leaving your grandpa? Balarama Balarama Balarama Balarama where did he go? come on, tell me where is Thampuran? Mother, tell me. leave me, leave me don't torment me, leave me alone, l am going, l am going oh my god. Abdulla Adbulla, god is with us. Mister Mister, what's this? did you kill His Highness this is the key of underground cell. Go and open it. my lord. ho! God saved us. what happened above? it was a fight. uncle and sons in-law and gundas, on the one side. Ananthan Namboodiri and Sankunni nair, on the other side. lt was a furious fight. don't know who all are fallen down hurt. No idea if there is any casualty. frankly speaking, l thought you are finished. when l was overpowered and put here, l thought he was going to kill me. now l realize that it was to save me. who might have done this? Ananthan. No, Abdulla what? Abdulla? yes. Both are the same person. l don't feel like leaving without, meeting you. l know that l have done unpardonable sins. l don't know how to expiate for this. this palace, harem and above all your great mind were disgraced by this unworthy man you can curse me l jumped into this adventure because, l was badly in need of money. l own only the address of my dad, who died when l was a small kid. it was my dad's house, his musical instruments, my mom's never ending tears that, made me a singer. but, l didn't reach anywhere. even when we were drowning, in huge debts, My mom told me not to give up, this house, Dad used to sing here. these walls know dad's voice. Dad's fingers ran through the strings, of this sitar and veena. but poor mom my mother could not die in the floor, of the house where father lived. l was ready to do anything to regain my, house by repaying the debts. even Amirkhan sahib had the, privilege to sleep in king Udayavarma's bedroom, he left behind only debts. now it is clear that such a man's, son cannot harm you. if l could do so, that father's son couldn't have faced, the plight to sing in the, red streets of Bombay. my lord, please pardon me for all the mistakes l have committed, considering me as the son of your old friend Anantha l have pardoned to the son of, Amirkhan Sahib but in whose name will you beg for pardon.. to an abnormal mother? what justification do you have to say, to my daughter who don't even, know to cry loudly. Unni, Unni, where is Unni? where is my Unni? Radha, call Unni? Unni come Unni, like the story of Krishna, who forgot bereaved Radha when leaving, for Mathura from Gokulam. my lord, if l was not a vulgar and poor Abdulla hmm. now all the vulgar people are out. just wearing a sacred thread, is nothing. Brahman means the one who knows God. Music is God you are a man who knows music. l am giving this palace and all my, properties in the name of Radha. if you are still ready to respond to, being addressed Unni, can't you please don't leave us? joy. the eternal joy, Universal joy, that is music. joy. the eternal joy, Universal joy, that is music. joy. the eternal joy, Universal joy, that is music. music music
