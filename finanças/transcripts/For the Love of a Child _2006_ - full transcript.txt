We still need to speak with him. He went out with friends. At this hour? The boys nine, you said? That's all right, you'll be OK now. We found him beaten, tied to his bed. There were marks on the postso this wasn't the first time. Kid hasn't said a word since then. You've left him with our doctor, right? Yes ma'am. He's in exam room now. Get the paperwork started,I'll get to the scene. Thank you. How did Jacob ever find thestrength to make that call? It's a miracle. We've seen our share of those over the years. Remember Tokyo? Our first miracle. [SINGING] If you're ever in a jam, here I am. If you're ever in a mess, SOS. If you ever get so happy that you land in jail, I'm your bail. It's friendship, friendship,just the perfect blendship. When other friendships have beenforgot, ours will still be hot. La da la da la da da, dee dee dee. So are you boys having a great time over here on this side of the Pacific? No! We hear you might need some new recruits. You think you could squeeze us in? Well, in that case private Sarah. And Private Yvonne reporting for duty. Could one of you boyspoint me in the direction of the Air Force beauty parlor? AUDIENCE MEMBER: You don't need one! YVONNE: Oh, aren't you boys so sweet. Why can't the boys at home be like you. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're all over here! [thunder] [SINGING] It's friendship, friendship, Just the perfect blendship-- [alarm siren] Sorry, sorry, ladies, gotto cut this short, ladies. Are we under attack? It's a weather siren. We've got to get back to your hotel. Careful. Let's go. Watch your step. OK, hold on. [thunder] DRIVER: Welcome to typhoon season. October in Japan. How long do these storms last? Anybody's guess. Days, maybe. But we have more shows. They're expecting us in Korea. We can't fight an act of God. Maybe he wants you to stay here. Oh. Sit tight. I'll be right back. Oh, Sarah, look. Oh my goodness. What are they doing out there? You shouldn't be dressed like that. You'll catch your death. Why aren't you guys at home? You understand home? Your parents? Mama-sans, Papa-sans? Oh my lord, do you think they're orphans? Are you hungry? I have some candy in my pockets. Oh my goodness, OK. OK. Bet they haven't had a decent meal in days. [thunder] Come here. Come on, kids. Come on. What are you doing? We can't leave them out here, Sarah. They'll freeze. Come on, honeys. Something tells me thisis going lead to trouble. One day. Come on. That's it, let's go. OK, come on. Let's go inside and get dry. Here we go. Open the door. That's it. Spot's our mascot. He won't let anything bad happen to you. My name is Dr. Riggs, and I'm only here to make sure you're OK. Are you good with that? OK. Let's just have a look here. This must've hurt. Can you tell me about it? Is it OK if I take a picture? [click] [click] OFFICER: I thought you'dwant to see these, detective. These Polaroids were in their room? Anything you might have seen, anything at all could be helpful. People in this neighborhoodkeep to themselves, detective. Privacy is very important to us. More important than protecting a child? That boy still needs your help. Give it some thought. Call me if anything comes to mind. I've seen your x-rays, Jacob. You have some broken bonesthat didn't heal very well. Did you know that? Can you tell me how that happened? Take your time. There is no hurry. The boys still not talking? Not a word so far. Well, he called our hotline and he spoke to one of the counselors,so we know we know he can talk. Just from observation earlier,he's about two years behind. He can't read very well. Typical for abused children. His father's a big shot attorney. No police record for him or his wife. But Jacob's teacher didfile a report last month. Too many sick days, suspicious injuries. Parents actually documented their abuse. What do you mean? Polaroids. Mrs. Fletcher has admittedshowing them to Jacob and promising it would all happen again if he didn't do what they told him. No wonder the boy's not talking. He's terrified. I've seen that in privatepractice before, but Polaroids? Is there a spot for Jacobat the Merv Griffin lodge? Wickenberg is at capacity,and so is our Virginia facility. What about California, Beaumont? Yvonne is already working on that. What's he holding back? It's a secret children, noone should know you're here. [knocking] Just a minute. Can you all hide? Hide? Peek-a-boo. What's Japanese for hide? I don't know. Hidey-sans. I can barely say hello. Down, down, down. That's it, that's it, goodgood good, down under under, under, under. I'm going to get the door. Only two ladies? So many towels. Yes, well we take a lot of showers. And you know, could talkto room service for us? We need some sandwiches? About 20. 20. Yeah, and three or four pitchers of milk. Were just starving. Famished. [giggling] You have child in here? Where you go-- So many children, no? Hotel should know. Thank you for the towels. Do you-- have you ever seena cashmere sweater before? See, it's soft. That's soft. If you were not to sayanything at all about this, you could have the sweater. All yours. OK? Our secret. Yes, thank you. Very generous, Yvonne. Considering it was my sweater. More towels? You call. Thank you. OK, before you say anything, Sarah and I didn't have any choice. They-- they didn't have anywhereto go, and they were freezing. That is not the issue. Well, no one with a heartcould have left these children out in that storm. It was terrible. The fact is, you can't keep them. There could be a diplomaticproblem for all of us. WOMAN: So what do we do? Toss them back on the streets. You need to do something. And if you don't, I will. [laughter] In your wildest dreams, could you ever expect anything like this? What, come here to sing and dance and ending up a mother hento a dozen unwanted chicks? Never. This will be your new home for a while, Jacob. It's a child help village. First one that Sarah and Yvonne created. What that sign says up there is true. Can you read it? It says all who enter here will find love. CHILD: Don't be afraid,you're gonna like it here. Jacob, this is Michael and this is David. You're going to be roommates. Here's some new clothes for you to start with, and you'll be able to become your own later. He get a new bike too,with your initials on it. Every kid does. This is my bed. And this is my bed, so keep off it. David. Well, it's mine. You get toys, too. You can earn points to buy more. You like it? What is he, stupid? Can he talk? That's enough. David, that's enough. Jacob. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, listen,I know it's a lot to take in, but all these boys have beenthe same shoes as you've been, and it's going to be OK. If you let us it's going to be fine. Jacob, look at me. If you give us a chance tohelp you, just let us help you, you'll be fine. Jacob, look at me. Jacob, no, look at me. It's going to be OK. You're going to be fine. You're going to be fine. Jacob. It's OK. It's OK. It's gonna be fine. GIRL: So who's the new kid? The kid the bus brought in today? What's his story? MAN: You know I'm not going toanswer a question like that. What's the big deal? How'd you like it if I talkedabout you with the other kids? Rusty, that's for the horses. Never seen him take toanybody like he has to you. We've both been through a lot. That's why. Yeah. If you mix red and blue, you get purple. You know that? Yeah. Like the color of a bruise. Or a plum or an eggplant. I thought eggs came from chickens. It's a vegetable. Nothing to do with eggs. Yeah? Huh. Yeah, maybe you could plantone in your garden patch. Maybe. How about using some ofthose colors you've mixed, maybe painting a picture? Do they pay you by the numberof pictures us kids turn out? No. Did you paint for your last art instructor? You're not an instructor,you're a therapist. I asked Mr. Aubrey about the new kid. Oh, and? He wouldn't tell me anything. Did you think you would? I heard he freaked out in his room. I heard he doesn't talk, and that's just creepy. And creepy around here is saying something. I bet he got beat up a lot at home. Bet his mom had aboyfriend who drank a lot, took drugs, and cut him whenhe didn't do what he was told. Is there more red? Yeah, there's some rightover there on the table. Looking at these kids, it'spretty hard to believe this could be their last chance. Most of them have been bouncedthrough a dozen foster homes before finding this place. I wish my daughter knew how lucky she is. Having trouble adjusting to the move? Oh, yeah. She misses her friends from Seattle, complains about me working too much. How long you've been divorced? Six years. Six years. How about you? Ever think of getting married, having kids? Nah, I've got a wholevillage of them right here. Well, thank god for the Village. God, Yvonne and Sarah. Those girls never take no for an answer. No. No. We are home here. Every place full. Typhoon has made many new orphans. But what about these children? We've been to five other orphanages, and no one will take them. How can you turn them away? They are not ours. Japanese, you mean? They most certainly are. Only part. Other part American. You won't take them becausethey're of mixed race? What difference does their background make? They're children. Children, yes, not ours. I'm very sorry. OK, honeys. What have we gotten ourselves into? Come on, honey. Come on. Come on, come on. [thunder] [grunting and moaning] I thought you might be cold. Why don't you want the covers on? My mom used to tuck me in all the time. She used to let me lighta cigarettes for her, too. She's coming to get me soon, I think. I don't hear from her much. That's because she's been sick. Either that or something. I should go back to bed. Julia? Sorry I'm late, honey. Julia? Honey? Who are you? This is Granger, he's helping me study. Oh, a little old to be inthe same class, aren't you? I'm not actually in school. We met at the mall. Right. Well, Granger, it's a little late and my daughter's a littleyoung for all this help, so maybe you could find your way to the door? Mom. It's OK. Some other time. Right. In about five years, Granger. I won't forget this. And neither will I. WOMAN: Sometimes I think we tryto be too many places at once. Would you call Bob and let him know that you were going to be late tonight. After all the years if I evershowed up at a decent hour, I think he'd faint. Hey. Hello, honey. Some interesting informationon the Jacob Fletcher case today. The Arizona record is clean, but a neighbor called and mentionedseeing a Colorado license plate when they moved in. And as usual, without a national database, their records didn't followthem from state to state. How many times have wecome up against this one? Someone has got to close that loophole. It may just have to be you and me, Yvonne. Admit it, you were wondering what to do with all that spare time. Remind me again why we gave up show business? At least now with his records to back us up, we can see those parents do time. How much time is the next question. Right. Oh, a package came for you from overseas. From Tokyo. Mama G. Oh. Yvonne. This can't be right. I know, it's barely a door. But this is the address he gave us. Maybe they read their numbers right to left like the newspaper. Oh excuse, me. Are you Mama G? Yes. Oh, you're the ladies, American ladies? Yes. Yes, a doctor with a Gospel Mission told us about the children you take in, the ones that no one else will help, and what good work you do. He tell me about you too, but-- sorry to say, no room here. It's OK. Come see. Come see. OK. Come on, honeys. Come on, sweetie. MAMA G: Come see. No crows, a little food. I can barely handle children I got. Suppose we get you some help? If we can do that. [inaudible] takes money and time. Well, the time we have, the rest-- We'll get. How? You say you sing? Tell a joke? People pay big money for that? I don't think so. She's obviously seen our act. [speaks japanese] I don't know how we'regoing to make this right. If we don't, who will? [bell ringing] Bye. Jacob? Jacob? So I just wanted to letyou know and let you hear me say how much me and your sister want to make this work again. I know you're thinking you heard it all before, but I'm doing the therapy every week. Mrs. Grayson can tell youthat, if you don't believe me. Three months so far. I haven't missed a meeting. Is there something youwant to say to me, sweetie? Laura, you can say whatever's on your mind. I don't know why I'm here. You're here to get better. I mean why am I here in this room? I don't want to see you. I hate you. Sweetie, we're family. I don't want that family anymore. If there was a way to get Karen away from you, I would do that too. Is he still there? No, but when he's finished his sentence-- it's Johnny's home too. I've talked to him, he's changed. Do I have to stay here? You don't have to doanything you don't want to do. Baby, no. [door opens and closes] I've done everything that they said to do. I don't know what else. You're still planning a life with a man who hurt your daughter. Johnny's been good to me. And he won't lay a hand on Karen, he's promised. I mean, he knows he didwrong, and he swore to me. If Laura would just give him half a chance. Mrs. Wade, this is the man whohas your daughter so terrified that she still wets her bed almost every night so that he'll leave her alone. This is the man who repeatedly molested her, who took a razor to her face. The sex was never proved. He's serving 10 months for it now. With the razor, that was an accident. He didn't mean to hurt her-- Did you listen to a word she said? Did you hear her? There is no chance in hell that she's coming home until at the veryleast you get that man out of your life. I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say to you. [DISTANT SINGING] If you'reever in a jam, here I am. If you're ever in a mess, SOS. It's friendship, friendship,just the perfect blendship. When other friendships have beenforgot, ours will still be hot. La da la da la da da, do do do. [cheering] Thank you. Thank you all. You think you haven't seenwomen over here in a while. I guess they haven't. Well, with all that'shappened we were in Japan a lot longer than planned. Sorry. Well, I guess you allknow that feeling, right? I want you know that we're just really happy we could be here for you. [applause] If we could get serious just for a minute. We'd like you to be there for us, too, because we need some help. We've discovered some children here in Tokyo, and they need homes. And no one will take them inbecause they're of mixed race. They're just kids who desperately need a helping hand, and you see Sarah and I, we've made a promise. A promise that we intend to keep. Yes, and we can't do that alone. And you're the onlyfriends we have over here. Yeah, so we're asking you, if you can find it in your hearts to maybe donate a few dollars, maybe help them out. Could you do that for us? Make their lives a little bit easier. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - Here you go, darling. Thank you. SOLDIER: I got some over here. Thank you very much. Very kind of you. Both countries are well aware of the problem. And both countries ignore it. And you're going to do whattwo major governments can't. Well, we can certainly try. MAN: Listen, they could have you on a plane and back to the states with a single call. Well, don't waste your dime. We won't go. Their fathers may have turnedtheir backs on these kids, but Yvonne and I can't. Colonel, could you handme that blouse out there? Don't make me pull rank. And don't make us-- well, please, just don't make us. Look, you've gottelevision and movies waiting for you back in Hollywood. Why are you wasting yourtime on a hopeless cause? Hopeless, it's onlyhopeless if we give up on it. Now that we're involved, you'll have to-- Carry us kicking and screamingto that plane of yours. Yvonne and I believe thatevery life has a purpose. And ours seem to betangled up with these kids. Do you have a family? These were your children,what would you want us to do? Dammit, I hired entertainers,not social workers. We'll have a planewaiting at 09:00 tomorrow. You have your stuff packed and be on it. And that's an order. [door closes] Looking forward to showingyou the ranch, Jacob. A little shy around animals, are you? A lot of the kids are. But I'm willing to bet that you're going to have a good time. So what is it you think you'd like to do? There's a lot of choices. There's gardening, there'sgrooming, feeding the animals. Any thoughts? Man of few words. Not always a bad thing. So hey, ever seen a cow up close, personal? That's Bessie. Why don't you go on over and introduce yourself. There's no reason to be afraid, she likes kids. Go on. Go on. Whoa, whoa, now. That's not the way, let go. Let go. That's not the way we treat animals around here, especially Bessie. She's been roughed upenough, haven't you, girl? Let me show you. She's a prize cow, blue ribbons, everything. Then one day, someonepoured acid all over her. You see? When she came to us, she's half dead. Afraid of people. Always stayed in that cornerover there, even if it meant getting real hot and thirsty. But with love, attention,a lot of patience, now she's as good as gold now. And you think on that the nexttime you feel like hitting her. She can't say it rightout, because she's a cow, but all she really needs is love. [moo] Take care of her for a minute. [moo] Jacob knows. Jacob knows. That's very good, Laura. It's only a line. Yeah, but it's a good line. And every great painting starts somewhere. I didn't make them up, they're just me. ANNIE: All of them? LAURA: Yes. ANNIE: Even this one? Mom's boyfriend cut all my hair off, so nobody else would think I was pretty. No offense, Mom, but all this is just sad. You never talk about normal things anymore. Well, we could talk about your schoolwork, but that's been pretty sad lately, too. The teachers here have it in for me. One has it in for you. Maybe if you spent more timeat home, you could help me. Oh, I see. Your lousy grades are my fault. My grades were fine in Seattle. I hate my life here. Honey, Julia, if you onlyknew how good you have it. As compared to what? Your freaks? Hey. That's enough. Sorry. Catch Child Help do you likeplastic surgery or something on this kid? Yes, they can. It has to be her choice. She has to be ready. If I had a face like,this I'd be ready last year. Why do you and those women-- Sarah and Yvonne. Right, why do they care so much about this kid? It's not just this kid. It's every kid. It's what they've fought for their whole lives. SARAH: Are we going to leavewithout a fight, Yvonne? Those kids need us. What about all that money we collected. It's not even enough to givethem a roof over their heads. A couple of months for food, maybe, but what happens when that's gone? Right. The easiest thing for us to do would be to go back to Hollywood andforget we ever met those kids. It's the easiest thing, all right. Except for the forgetting part. All they need is a place to be safe. Where's the baby? In the nursery. That's where he belongs. Do you want to talk aboutwhy the baby belongs there? Well, today I thought wecould do a drawing of someone really special. Of who? Of you. Of Jacob? Come on, I'll show you. Stand up here against the paper. Put your arms out. There we go, now we're going to start. And I'm going to draw around your arms, your legs and your head. And now you get to fill it in,color it in, anyway you like. Jacob can't draw very good. Not like the other kids. Well, you know, that'swhat makes this so special. Is that it's just yoursand not like anyone else's. OK? That's great. Big, beautiful eyes like yours. Good nose. How about ears? Can't hear anything without ears. Jacob doesn't like what he hears. What about a mouth? He always says the wrongthing, doesn't need a mouth. Well, you can still colorin any of the other parts. What would you like to draw next? Look at that. It's stupid. Should just cut it off it looks so stupid. Jacob's bad. Jacob's bad. Stupid. Jacob's just stupid. Too stupid to live. [grunting] FATHER: [WHISPERING] Jacob. Jacob. Jacob. Jacob. You can't hide from me forever, pal. MOTHER: Why'd you have to be so bad, honey? You know I can't help you now. FATHER: Did you reallythink I wouldn't find you? No, please, no please. [inaudible] Please. No, please. Jacob? Are you OK? We wish it were more. But that's all we could manage. Already such a blessing. So few even try. This can go a long way. But can it go far enough? Mama G. [speaking japanese] What soldiers doing here? Oh, they're not here foryou, they're here for us. You asked me what I'd doif they were my children? I'll tell you what I'd do. Better yet, I'll show you. Gentlemen? They're all volunteers. Here on their own time. The answer to our prayers. It's a miracle. God works in mysterious ways. Even through Colonel Johnson. YVONNE: Before we left Japan wehad 100 children in our care. We came back and built four orphanages that went on to help thousands. By then, there was a controversial war raging in Southeast Asia. SARAH: With lots of help we managed to build five moreorphanages and a Children's Hospital in Vietnam. But when the bombs began to fall, we had no choice but to evacuate. It became known as Operation baby lift. Oh my goodness. I know you're allfrightened, and you don't even know what I'm saying rightnow, but the most important thing is that you're safe now. Hi. Yvonne? This one needs attention. Oh, we have a medical team downstairs. It's OK. Here, honey. Sarah? Let's look at you, OK. Oh. Angela, honey, can you take this one, please? Let's get the sick ones andthe youngest ones off first. Sarah? I need to talk to you. We were expecting more. Did you get all the kids outof the China Beach orphanage? No. The Viet Kong moving too fast. We barely got the plane off the ground. There was fire all around us. But the children. We got as many as we could. If we hadn't left when we did-- as we took off, we bankedleft over the beach to see the staff getting the others out by bus. When I looked back, I saw the rest of the children beingpulled out of their hiding places out onto the beach. They were lined up and they just shot them. [sobbing] WOMAN: Doctor? I'm sorry. It's OK. After all we did, it wasn't enough. So then we'll just have to do more. OK? A few months in jail, that's all? For what those people did to Jacob? Most child abusers don't do any time. Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher. I want to see my son. And I want you to make that happen. Jacob has had a very difficulttime adjusting, and he-- FATHER: Of course he's has hada very difficult time adjusting. He's surrounded by strangers. He needs to be home. He needs to be safe. The boy needs to know that thereare people who care about him, who want the best for him. Who Jacob is with isn't your decision. Not when it comes right down to it. He's not your son. And he's not your property. Will you arrange the visit, or do I bring the courts into this? We can't stop you from seeing him but I swear I will walk through fire to make sure you don't havecontrol over his life again. Dig deeper. Keep those people from evergetting that boy back again. Laura, would you help mewash the brushes, please? Sure. Laura, are you OK? No, don't make me! It's OK, it's all right, Laura. It's OK. Come on, come sit down. Come sit down. Where did you go just now? I was back home. Sometimes if I did something,or didn't do something, my mother's boyfriend. Johnny. He'd fill the tub with hot water. Only the hot. And he'd push me in. My skin blistered sometimes. Did he give you a reason why? Maybe I didn't get him a beer when he asked, or maybe he didn't like the way I looked at him. Sometimes he'd lock me in the closet, and I couldn't get out toeat, go to the bathroom. My sister would shove foodin the crack under the door if he didn't catch her. Did he hurt her, too? I'd sleep in front of her on the bed at night, press her against the wallso he couldn't reach her. So he'd take me instead. Where was your mother when this was happening? At work, I guess. I don't know. Did she know what was going on? She says she didn't. Did you ever tell her? Did you ever ask her to make it stop? Johnny called me a liar and said that he'd move out if Mom took my side. So she believed him. Even after. After? Mrs. Grayson, if somebodydid this to your daughter, would you just let them stay there? MOTHER: This all a misunderstanding. I know my rights, Mr. Aubrey. Oh good, have a seat. Let's talk about those rights. You can visit your son, butonly here and with supervision, unless and until the courts say otherwise. And the courts they tend tolisten to what Child Help has to say, so like it ornot, this is the beginning of a long, long process. All I want is my child back. Have you ever asked Jacobhow he feels about that? He's a kid. He wants to be home. You do want that, don't you sweetheart? What are you doing? Huh? Jacob? It looks like you're packing. Are you packing? Shh! Jacob's got to go. They'll get him if he doesn't. If he goes, you won't meet my mom. Don't you want to meet her? Sorry. Jacob's gotta go. [distant sirens] I thought that might be you. Come into town to checkout the nightlife, did you? Jacob's waiting for a bus. Bus, huh? Yeah, might be a bit of a wait. Next one doesn't come by till tomorrow morning. Can I give you a lift? Back your cottage? If Jacob goes back,something bad will happen. Are you hungry? Me, I'd go for a burger and fries. Maybe even chocolate shake. Hate to eat alone. Think you might want to keep me company? Yeah, sure. Get away if you want. You'll be missing a lot. Parties and friends, school. Teachers say that you're doing so well lately. Pass the ketchup, there. Jacob moved up a whole grade. Can work with computer now. Not many kids can accomplishsomething like that so fast. Did I mention that Bessie'sbeen asking about you? Cows don't talk. Doesn't mean that theydon't have something to say. You weren't talking when you came to us either, you remember? But you had plenty on your mind. Still do, I guess. Look. I know. Does it trip you up? Here's the bottom line. You put your trust in me and Annie, in your cottage supervisorand all the counselors that are looking out for you. We will never let you down. You don't want to go home, andwe will do our best to make sure that that doesn't happen. Here you go. You got any money on you? This one's on me. You know, a bus is going to cost you a few bucks. You can't get that far on charm alone. WOMAN: Three million cases of child abuse are reported every year. That's more than 10,000 a day. Ladies, we know the statistics. It's what we do for a living. Not very successfully, if these numbers are any indication. We came here because Mrs. Reagan asked us to meet with you. She asked you to meet with us because she agrees that these children needa safe and healing environment. Instead of moving the childrenfrom agency to agency, bring the professionals to them. We want to approach the childabuse problem from all sides, psychologically,environmentally, educationally, legally, spiritually. Combine conventional therapies with art therapy, animal therapy. Just throw everythingbut the kitchen sink at it. To accomplish something like that you'd need-- A village. You'd need a village. Eventually several. If you had any experience at all, you know that wouldn't work. Let me tell you what won't work. Ignoring the problem won't work. Assuming there is no solution won't work. Sitting on your tail admiringyour diploma won't work. Do people ever get tired of saying no? Well, Yvonne and I've never been that way and we never will be. We've asked all of you herebecause we need your help. But if you're not up to it, we'll just go right across this country and knock on every door untilwe put the right team together. Yvonne, you have anythingyou'd like to add? Yes, I do. We'd like a commitment from each of you. A promise to help, or else wewon't let you leave the room. Can Jacob see Bessie? I don't know, pal. She's probably still sleeping. But, yeah, I guess she'd like that. Go ahead. Hey there, Bess. It's OK now. It's OK. It's OK. I love you, Bessie. No! No covers. OK. [calming music] Nice work, cowboy. You're in awful early, aren't you? The hours it takes are the hours it takes. I saw you pull in. Kid had a rough night. Took till dawn to talk him into coming back. How did you know what he needed to hear? I was that kid once. My Ma used to hit the bottle. When she did, her moods turned violent. Damn near killed me once or twice. Is that why you don't want to have children? Family abuse runs in cycles. Stops with me. Well, from what I can see,the cycle is already broken. If that's true, I owe it to this place. There's something about thisproperty that's healing. Sarah and Yvonne must've felt that when they first laid eyes on it. BISHOP O'CONNOR: This is a large tract. Building already herefrom our recent Boys Town. You are offering us lessthan half what we're asking. That's your final offer, then-- Bishop O'Connor, we are prepared to offer more than that. You see the orphanage thatwe helped build in Tokyo, they baked cookies. Mama G and all the children. And they sold them on thestreets to raise money for us. They raised almost $5,000. Those must be some cookies. Yes. We're talking millions. It's all very touching, ladies,but business is business. All right, then wellthen let's talk business. You're never going to sell thisland for what you're asking, and that's just a fact. Sorry to be blunt, but it'sout in the middle of nowhere, and it's of no use to anyone. Everyone but us. And when you look at it thatway, you actually need us. We need you? Am I hearing you correctly? Bishop O'Connor, we are looking for a place that we can help undo thedamage that these children have suffered. This could be that place. But we only have 1.8 that we can offer. Plus the cookies. Well, then I supposewe'll just have to take it. Oh! Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Where are you going, Rusty? Where are you going? Where's Mr. Alberi? Getting some breakfast, I'm keeping watch. Well, Bessie and me. Jacob had a late night. I heard. Can I sit with you? Just till he wakes up? Of course. Come on. Mrs. Grayson? Mm-hm? Am I pretty? Yes. Yes, you are. Some of the kids call me Scarface. Well, they just can't see what I see. A beautiful girl who cares about other kids. Like Jacob. Sometimes I forget it'sthere and I look in the mirror and it surprises me. Like it's somebody else looking back. I wish it would go away. We can make that happen. But only if that's what you really want. It didn't used to be. But I think maybe now it is. OVERHEAD SPEAKER: Phone call for Dr. Michaelson. Dr. Michaelson. You nervous? Yeah, a little. You look like you're gonna cry. Is it that bad? No. You can see for yourself. You're like new. Now there's a little bitof redness and some swelling, but that's going to fade over the next few weeks. It's wonderful, Laura. It really is. When you were born, you were the most beautiful baby I'd ever seen. Your skin was pink and perfect. Now you're that way again. It's like you're born all over. Take another look. It's great. Thank you. You're welcome. [applause] Mrs. Grayson? Hey, Laura, you're up next. Jacob. Laura. No more Scarface. See? Looks great. I got your card in the hospital. You made it yourself, right? Yeah. OK, so next for our Halloween entertainment, Laura Wade would like to read us something. Something she wrote herself. [applause] I used to want to be a bird, away up in a tree, or a fish that swims foreverin a world beneath the sea. I wanted to be anyone or anything that's free, but I'm not hiding anymore. Now last I see that all I really wanted was for me to just be me. [applause] Wow. Is that our Laura? It's pretty amazing the power they have to heal. Thanks, Sheriff. Michael? That's my mom. WOMAN: Michael? Mom, Mommy! I knew you'd come. We're petitioning thecourts to regain custody. Well, you're welcome to try Mr. Fletcher. But it's our opinion and the opinion of all the social workers who know your case that will determine whether or not Jacob can be returned to you. You've kept him from us without just cause. We mean to prove that andrectify the situation. You both have children. As mothers you must know whata child means to a parent. I know, even betterthan most, Mrs. Fletcher. But I also know your history with Jacob. Yes, we've seen the x-rays and the bruises, the photographs you yourself-- We've served our time. Miss, if you won't turnhim over to us yourselves, we're prepared to let theauthorities do it for you. Let's go. Things will be different this time. I promise. [school bell rings] Mrs. Grayson? Yes? That's David. What's he doing? He didn't tell you? He's being adopted today by a Child Help chapter member family. Oh, hey, Jacob. Bye. [groaning] That's it. Good. Good, see? It's a lot easier than youthought it would be, isn't it? That's great, Jacob, good work. [whimpering] Yeah, yeah, turn him, turn him. Use your leg. Now we're talking. That's it. Good. Great. That's it, looking good. [whimpering] Hey. What are you working on? Putting together the best parts of me. Well, there are a lot of really good parts, aren't there? What do you think? You like it? I love it. You hate it. Did you think I wouldn't? This isn't some newshade of lipstick, Julia, you should've asked me. It's my body. Not until you're 18, it's not. This is so typical. You tolerate the most freakybehavior from these loser kids every day, and yet you come along and expect me to be perfect. Well, I'm tired of it. You call this art? I call it therapy. Is this supposed to be a tree? It's the project I startmy children off with. Every kid knows what a tree looks like, but how they paint it reflectswhat they've been through. What's that? It's a trauma hole. It's a marker for molestation. The closer to the top it is, the more recent. The larger it is, the more invasive. That was painted by a 7-year-old boy. That's him there. He misspelled pieces. His mother used to cut him with razor blades, but only where his clotheswould cover his scars. You know, Julia, these are pictures of lives that childrenshouldn't even have to imagine, and these kids lived them. You should come to the villagesometime, see for yourself. Like I'd actually do that. Bye, Michael. Bye. So how do you really feelabout Michael going home today? On paper, his mother's done everything the judge demanded of her. You don't really trust her, do you? Let's hope for the best. I don't want you to leave. It's all going to be great now. It's all I ever wanted. Really. When you're afraid at night, think of me, OK? Now I'll be better. I'll write you. I'll write you back, Michael. You're the best friend I ever had. You too. Maybe we can go camping sometime like we talked. And maybe my mom will take us. Yeah. BOY: Well, goodbye. We've got a long drive ahead of us. Get a move on now. You call us if you need us, OK Michael? All I need is my mom. MICHAEL: Right. OK. I said, get in the car, Michael. MICHAEL: Bye, Jacob. Bye, Michael. [whimpering] [sobbing] So I have a new budget here,and there is an item we need-- Sarah? Little Michael's dead. What? From [inaudible],, oh thatpoor sweet little boy. We should've never allowedhim to go back to that woman. Honey, we had no choice. We should have fought harder, found a way. Something. It's like I'm losing my own son again. It's 20 years ago and hearing about the crash and knowing there's nothing I could do. If we can't save one small boy-- We have saved thousands. Thousands aren't enough, not today. It should have been one more. It should have been Michael. Oh, honey, shh. Shh. I know you must be missingmy chicken sandwiches. They've got chicken here. Not like mine, I bet. Johnny's never coming back. Did you know that? I told him that he wasn't welcome. You were right. It was the thing to do to protect Karen, and to prove to you that Imean what I've been saying. You're my life, Laura. You and your sister. Why should she believe you, Mrs. Wade? Well, I'm speaking from my heart. What about tomorrow, though? Or next week, or next year? Well, there is no calendar on my love for my daughter, Mrs. Grayson. You can't just expect her to come-- I don't expect her to do anything except for to give me a chance. Um, I got a new job, and wemoved to an apartment that's closer to the school, right? I really hope you come home, Laura. I miss you. I miss you, too. You know what? We don't have to decide right now, OK? Let's just have our picnic,and then we can talk about this more next time, OK? Mrs. Grayson? I made extra. No, thank you. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Now, you OK? Yeah. After what happened to Michael, I-- I looked at Laura and all I could think was what might happenif that little girl goes home. She might. We don't have the final say. We just have to accept that. I can't lose another one of these kids. Right now you can give Laura what I know you give your own daughter. The conviction that she'sworthy of respect and love. Yeah. Julia? Yes? Honey, are you down here? JULIA: Yes. You OK? You checking up on me? Just making sure you're safe. What's safer than my own house? Mm. So you've been going through my things. JULIA: Well, kind of. Since you showed them to me Ican't stop thinking about them. This one here, is this a picture of how he feels? Or how it really was? Well, this was painted by a girl. Six years old. Locked in the basement most of her life. Neighbors didn't even knowshe existed until a relative called child services. You really care about these kids. Yeah. I do. But that doesn't mean I care any less about you. I love you, you know that, right? I love you, too. That's good to hear. And you know it's good for bothof us to hear now and then, right? Sure is. Back to homework. Oh, thanks. These'll be pretty. I saw you coming out of the chapel this morning. Well, I had some things Ineeded to talk over with God. You think he really listens? I think he does. Yes. Why, is there something youneed to talk over with him? I was wondering what Godthought about me going home. I mean, I want to trust mymother, but I'm not sure I can. And I need to be there for my sister. You know, those aregood questions to ask God. I used to ask my mom questions all the time. When I asked about God, shesaid he never made mistakes. Then Johnny heard ustalking and he said that God made a mistake when he made me. You know, there's a sayingmy mother used to tell me. Consider the source. Yeah. Consider the source. You got it. [sobbing] Jacob? He needs to breathe. Hey, what are you doing out here? He needs a straw to breathe through. Even then it-- it's hard. Who are you talking about? The baby. The baby. In the ground. The baby in the ground? Tell me about the baby, Jacob. The daddy, he digged a hole in the back yard and he used to do it. Made to lie down in it. FATHER: Get down there and stay down there! Because if he screams,he'll be in there longer. The mommy she gets him a strawthe breathe through and-- And he fills the hole. He wouldn't have doneit if he hadn't been bad. What's the baby's name, son? Jacob. I know. [sobbing] Yeah. Yeah, hey, hey. You're a good kid. You're a good kid. You're a good kid. You're a good kid. You're a good kid. You're a good kid. You're a good kid. Good kid, Jacob. NEIGHBOR: I'm up late a lot, you know. Out walking my dog. Every now and then I'd seethe lights come on back here. They're just-- I mean, well, I thought it was a bit strange being in the middleof the night and all, but-- Did you ever hear anything? Like? Like noises. People talking, someone digging. Digging? Detective? My god. What were they doing to him? I'm losing my patience with you, Mr. Avery. I really am. Has something happened we should know about? Yes. Your case is about to be reopened. Nonsense. We can't be tried twice forthe same supposed crime. This is a new crime, Mr. Fletcher. A new crime? This time I hope they throw away the key. Bart? Relax. They found nothing becausethere's nothing to find. I'm here almost 15 years, Fletcher. Thought I'd seen it all. Whatever Jacob's told you is all in his head. He's always been a liar. If you knew what kind of trouble he causes. What kind of trouble wouldmake you bury your son alive? Oh my god. No, not another word. You'll be hearing from me. You and this whole damn organization. Thanks to this damnorganization the law sides with kids these days. Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher,you'll have to come with me. It's just beautiful, sweetie. It's the first one she's let me put up. I know Johnny hurt you, honey. And if there was some way to goback and take that pain away, I would. You let him do that to me. How does that make you any better than him? It doesn't. But I will find some way to make it up to you. I will prove it to you, I will,no matter how long it takes. OK. I think they're allwonderful, picking a top three, which are your favorites? Like this one? Yeah? I think you did a great job with this guy. He's got a pretty fancy hairdo. Julia? You said this art show was open to everybody. So I thought I'd come and check it out. I'm glad, I'm glad you came. Well, listen. I know I've been kind of a pain lately, and-- Yeah, well you're a teenager. It's part of the job description, right? But until the othernight I didn't even really get what you were doing here. Anyway, I was thinking maybe there's some kid who could use a friend. I could. Julia, this is Jacob. Jacob, this is my daughter Julia. Hi. You're lucky that you have such a cool mom. Oh, you think? So are any of these paintings yours? A couple. Want to see? Sure, give me the whole tour. I'm not very good yet. But Annie, I mean Mrs. Grayson, your mom says that's not the point. [barking] Ready, ready, go get it, Rusty. I don't know who's going tomiss you more, me or Rusty. Or me. Don't worry, I'll come back when I can. I really don't want you to leave. Jacob, you'll be fine. And whatever happens, you'll find a good home. I already found a good home. It's right here. How lucky is that? I guess we're both lucky for this place. I'll keep it forever. I might even send you a newpainting if it's good enough. What are you talkingabout, if it's good enough? If it's from you, of course it will be good enough. Besides, I couldn't let youleave without a proper goodbye. Laura, you sure about this? Going home, I mean? No. But it's important to me to try again. Then it's important to me, too. I'm going to miss you. I'll miss you, too. [whistling] Hey, Jacob. Sarah and Yvonne. Look at you. Hello. Well, I guess we don'thave to ask how you're doing. Everything's great. Oh, fantastic. You look wonderful. Thanks all you've done for me. This is such a nice surprise, Jacob. We heard you're in college now. Pre-med. Good for you. What brings you back here? Couldn't stay away forever. Came back to volunteer. I thought there might be someonewho needed a special friend. You know there is. Always. Come with us, he's right over here. We'll introduce you. His name is Andrew, he'shad such a rough time of it. You could be the perfectperson to make a difference, won't he, Sarah? Absolutely. The perfect person. And what's life all about ifyou can't make a difference? Hey, Andrew. I'm Jacob. [music playing]
